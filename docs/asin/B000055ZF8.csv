567710,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000055ZF8,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 3]","I have not seen the Jude Law vehicle that brought this film to my attention.  I never really had any desire to.  I like Law, but the remake looked rather stale (and the reviews didn't help) so I stayed away.  HOWEVER, I didn't even know that this film existed until trailers for that remake started popping up so I thank them for that.  I researched this Caine vehicle shortly thereafter and have since purchased it and relish in it on many occasions.It makes me laugh, it makes me cry, it makes me mad; it makes me all sorts of everything.`Alfie' tells the story of, you guessed it, Alfie, a womanizer who relishes in a life of leisure.  He drifts aimlessly from one woman to another, treating them horribly and yet they never leave him because he is so, well, charming.  The film really takes the most pivotal chunk of Alfie's life and serves it to the audience.  In this `chunk' we see Alfie become a father, squander that opportunity, get sick, betray a friend by messing around with his emotionally fragile wife, seek out an abortionist, fall for an older woman (who proves to be his equal) and finally coming to a certain understanding of his own state and where he needs to strive to be.The film is a comedy (not sure why the Globes considered it a Drama) but it has a very mature and dramatic tone to it.  There are some mature themes (like the ones I just mentioned) that make this film so much more than just a meaningless comedy about debauchery.And then there is Michael Caine.This year was very rich in the best actor category, but for me this year was all about Caine.  His riveting portrayal of a charismatic yet emotionally stunted man was just spot-on perfection.  I love the repartee he has with the audience (he spends a great chuck of time conversing with you directly) and the way he never loses his character's grounding.  He has the comedic wit down pat, the sarcastic egotism down pat, the emotionally restricted development down pat, not to mention the devastating aftermath of shattered realizations down pat (that scene, in the kitchen, hand over mouth...O.M.G.).  It is a perfectly executed and completely well-rounded performance.The supporting cast (that slew of seductive women) is also very well used here.  I'm shocked that Julia Foster (who would win my supporting actress award this year) was not singled out.  I know that Merchant had the weightier role, but Foster was just astonishingly good as the mother of Alfie's child.  She perfectly matched Caine every step of the way.  Shelly Winters was also quite effective (I just love her) as the seductive Ruby.  In fact, everyone here is just wonderful and they all completely understand and develop their roles in ways that elevate this movie beautifully, beings that each character adds a layer or varying facet to this films overall composition.In the end, SEE THIS MOVIE.  It is a multi-layered dramedy that is a bag of mixed emotions complete with stellar performances and a genuinely engaging, original and memorable script.",5,An unforgettable and quite beautiful look at the soul of a man...,1259798400,"12 3, 2009",2009,3015,"['have', 'not', 'seen', 'Jude', 'Law', 'vehicle', 'brought', 'film', 'attention', 'never', 'really', 'had', 'desire', 'Law', 'remake', 'looked', 'rather', 'stale', 'reviews', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'so', 'stayed', 'away', 'HOWEVER', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'film', 'existed', 'trailers', 'remake', 'started', 'popping', 'up', 'so', 'thank', 'researched', 'Caine', 'vehicle', 'shortly', 'thereafter', 'have', 'purchased', 'relish', 'many', 'occasions.It', 'cry', 'mad', 'sorts', 'everything.', 'Alfie', 'story', 'guessed', 'Alfie', 'womanizer', 'who', 'life', 'leisure', 'aimlessly', 'one', 'woman', 'treating', 'horribly', 'yet', 'never', 'leave', 'so', 'well', 'charming', 'film', 'really', 'most', 'pivotal', 'chunk', 'Alfie', 'life', 'audience', 'chunk', 'see', 'Alfie', 'become', 'father', 'squander', 'opportunity', 'get', 'sick', 'betray', 'friend', 'messing', 'around', 'emotionally', 'fragile', 'wife', 'seek', 'out', 'abortionist', 'fall', 'older', 'woman', 'who', 'be', 'equal', 'finally', 'coming', 'certain', 'understanding', 'own', 'state', 'where', 'strive', 'be.The', 'film', 'comedy', 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'Globes', 'considered', 'Drama', 'very', 'mature', 'dramatic', 'tone', 'are', 'mature', 'themes', 'ones', 'just', 'mentioned', 'make', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'meaningless', 'comedy', 'debauchery.And', 'then', 'Michael', 'Caine.This', 'year', 'was', 'very', 'rich', 'best', 'actor', 'category', 'year', 'was', 'Caine', 'riveting', 'portrayal', 'charismatic', 'yet', 'emotionally', 'stunted', 'man', 'was', 'just', 'spot-on', 'perfection', 'love', 'repartee', 'audience', 'great', 'chuck', 'time', 'conversing', 'directly', 'way', 'never', 'character', 'grounding', 'comedic', 'wit', 'down', 'pat', 'sarcastic', 'egotism', 'down', 'pat', 'emotionally', 'restricted', 'development', 'down', 'pat', 'not', 'mention', 'devastating', 'aftermath', 'shattered', 'realizations', 'down', 'pat', 'scene', 'kitchen', 'hand', 'mouth', 'O.M.G.', 'perfectly', 'executed', 'completely', 'well-rounded', 'performance.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'slew', 'seductive', 'women', 'also', 'very', 'well', 'used', 'here', ""'m"", 'shocked', 'Julia', 'Foster', 'who', 'would', 'win', 'supporting', 'actress', 'award', 'year', 'was', 'not', 'singled', 'out', 'know', 'Merchant', 'had', 'weightier', 'role', 'Foster', 'was', 'just', 'astonishingly', 'good', 'mother', 'Alfie', 'child', 'perfectly', 'matched', 'Caine', 'step', 'way', 'Shelly', 'Winters', 'was', 'also', 'quite', 'effective', 'just', 'love', 'seductive', 'Ruby', 'fact', 'everyone', 'here', 'just', 'wonderful', 'completely', 'understand', 'develop', 'roles', 'ways', 'elevate', 'movie', 'beautifully', 'beings', 'character', 'layer', 'varying', 'facet', 'films', 'overall', 'composition.In', 'end', 'SEE', 'THIS', 'MOVIE', 'multi-layered', 'dramedy', 'bag', 'mixed', 'emotions', 'complete', 'stellar', 'performances', 'genuinely', 'engaging', 'original', 'memorable', 'script']",N/A

Wonderfully played by Michael Caine in a role that shot him into international stardom, he took advantage of women for certain tradeoffs such as a foot job, a dry cleaning, a place to stay, etc., all for gratis by providing them ephemeral happiness and sex. Along the way, he unintentionally impregnated two women only to abandon both of them and to induce the other to perform an abortion in the kitchen. It may sound like a repulsive and offensive picture, and believe me, I was. But Alfie was actually a good film and much ahead of its time, predating the filming of Carnal Knowledge by good five years. There were many salient points about Alfie that still ring true today. It's a fascinating portrayal of how women were treated as a sex object and were seen nothing more than that. Michael Caine did a brilliant job as the unfeeling, emotionless lothario who only cared about himself and his needs. In his manner, he would demean the women by his way of ordering them about and making criticisms in how they did things in certain ways. He constantly referred them as ""it,"" not ""she."" One could see how the women were simply reduced to nothing and had lost their self-esteem. Quite so, Alfie was a depressing film to watch. On the other hand, for purely technical merit, Michael Caine was brilliant in his narration and largely helped by the wonderful colloquial language created by Bill Naughton. There was a certain poetry in it. All in all, many will be offended by Alfie, and others will look at it at a different way and discover interesting points.",4,An Offensive and Depressing Picture Yet Brilliantly Made.,1394323200,"03 9, 2014",2014,1710,"['Viewed', '3/14Rate', '83/14', 'What', 'expected', 'was', 'entertaining', 'sex', 'romp', 'comedy', 'Alfie', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'very', 'dark', 'picture', 'professional', 'Lothario', 'Wonderfully', 'played', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'role', 'shot', 'international', 'stardom', 'took', 'advantage', 'women', 'certain', 'tradeoffs', 'such', 'foot', 'job', 'dry', 'cleaning', 'place', 'stay', 'etc.', 'gratis', 'providing', 'ephemeral', 'happiness', 'sex', 'way', 'unintentionally', 'impregnated', 'two', 'women', 'only', 'abandon', 'induce', 'other', 'perform', 'abortion', 'kitchen', 'may', 'sound', 'repulsive', 'offensive', 'picture', 'believe', 'was', 'Alfie', 'was', 'actually', 'good', 'film', 'much', 'ahead', 'time', 'predating', 'filming', 'Carnal', 'Knowledge', 'good', 'five', 'years', 'were', 'many', 'salient', 'points', 'Alfie', 'still', 'ring', 'true', 'today', 'fascinating', 'portrayal', 'how', 'women', 'were', 'treated', 'sex', 'object', 'were', 'seen', 'nothing', 'more', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'did', 'brilliant', 'job', 'unfeeling', 'emotionless', 'lothario', 'who', 'only', 'cared', 'needs', 'manner', 'would', 'demean', 'women', 'way', 'ordering', 'making', 'criticisms', 'how', 'did', 'things', 'certain', 'ways', 'constantly', 'referred', 'not', 'One', 'could', 'see', 'how', 'women', 'were', 'simply', 'reduced', 'nothing', 'had', 'lost', 'self-esteem', 'Quite', 'so', 'Alfie', 'was', 'depressing', 'film', 'watch', 'other', 'hand', 'purely', 'technical', 'merit', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'was', 'brilliant', 'narration', 'largely', 'helped', 'wonderful', 'colloquial', 'language', 'created', 'Bill', 'Naughton', 'was', 'certain', 'poetry', 'many', 'will', 'be', 'offended', 'Alfie', 'others', 'will', 'look', 'different', 'way', 'discover', 'interesting', 'points']",N/A

I couldn't get past the chauvinism of Michael Caine.  Alfie is a cruel, merciless, and heartless man. He is self-absorbed, utterly insensitive, and totally domineering. He cheerfully holds his ""birds"" to standards of loyalty he himself needn't bother with. He ruthlessly undermines the individuality and autonomy of everyone he is with, even when pretending to be a liberating force. Notice in his scenes with Gilda how his words sound as though he's endorsing freedom, independence, and self-determination, but the effect of those words is to keep her right under his thumb where she belongs. Alfie deserves our sympathy, yes, but he also deserves our hatred, loathing, and utter contempt.However, the ending, for me is the key point in liking Caine's character, as without spoiling the film, the final scene, set against the Thames at night, is an outstanding piece of writing and direction",2,Didn't do much for me,1177632000,"04 27, 2007",2007,1001,"['Maybe', 'was', 'had', 'recently', 'watched', 'newer', 'version', 'Alfie', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'chauvinism', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Alfie', 'cruel', 'merciless', 'heartless', 'man', 'self-absorbed', 'utterly', 'insensitive', 'totally', 'domineering', 'cheerfully', 'birds', 'standards', 'loyalty', 'need', ""n't"", 'bother', 'ruthlessly', 'individuality', 'autonomy', 'everyone', 'even', 'when', 'pretending', 'be', 'liberating', 'force', 'Notice', 'scenes', 'Gilda', 'how', 'words', 'sound', 'endorsing', 'freedom', 'independence', 'self-determination', 'effect', 'words', 'keep', 'right', 'thumb', 'where', 'Alfie', 'sympathy', 'yes', 'also', 'hatred', 'loathing', 'utter', 'contempt.However', 'ending', 'key', 'point', 'liking', 'Caine', 'character', 'spoiling', 'film', 'final', 'scene', 'set', 'Thames', 'night', 'outstanding', 'piece', 'writing', 'direction']",N/A

Caine plays a Cockney philanderer who flits from woman to woman in one night stands.  He is not attractive necessarily though to female viewers who will find his lower class bent offputting.  His lifestyle will come off as tawdry at best to many of these viewers. Caine's brilliance in this role though is that his way of talking to you the viewer, speaking directly into the camera conversationally throughout the movie, draws you into the character of Alfie, wanting to know what makes him the way he is.

Big subjects, both.Can individual men gain personal advantages by avoiding intimate contact and commitment to women? Yes.In about 1000 A.D., the Roman Catholic Church decided to vote ""No"" on marriage for its priesthood. There was a reason, and the incredible wealth and power of that organization down the ages is connected to that simple decision. It was profound, and still is.The Roman Catholic Church gained enormous practical advantages due to its decision, and individual men (including ones not at all religious or in any way connected to the Roman Catholic Church) can gain the same advantages by making the same decision.One ""Comments"" writer discussing this movie on this site compared it to La Dolche Vita (1960), another ""laundry list of problems different types of women provide men"" movie. Good comparison.Women are attractive, often, especially in youth, and so are favors they sometimes provide men.But.......... are the favors worth the price men pay (sometimes demanded by women, sometimes by others), and how long do the favors keep coming, and at what level of quality?Are women worth the price men pay?That is the main question the movies Alfie (1966) and La Dolche Vita (1960) present and ask.The clear answer is, sadly, ""No."" That's ""what it's all about,"" Alfie.------------Written by Tex Allen, SAG Actor.Visit WWW.IMDb.Me/TexAllen Com for movie credits, and biographical information about Tex Allen.Email Tex Allen at TexAllen@Rocketmail.Com",5,"Alfie (1966) asks ""Are women worth the price men pay?",1351382400,"10 28, 2012",2012,1911,"['Alfie', '1966', 'Are', 'women', 'price', 'men', 'pay', '29', 'July', '2009Alfie', '1966', 'laundry', 'list', 'many', 'many', 'problems', 'large', 'small', 'men', 'face', 'when', 'become', 'intimate', 'women.Money', 'problems', 'health', 'problems', 'social', 'problems', 'emotional', 'problems', 'on.The', 'movie', 'Alfie', '1966', 'questions', 'intimate', 'contact', 'men', 'have', 'women', 'about', 'commitment', 'women', 'option', 'men', 'can', 'choose', 'refuse', 'Big', 'subjects', 'both.Can', 'individual', 'men', 'gain', 'personal', 'advantages', 'avoiding', 'intimate', 'contact', 'commitment', 'women', 'Yes.In', '1000', 'A.D.', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'decided', 'vote', 'No', 'marriage', 'priesthood', 'was', 'reason', 'incredible', 'wealth', 'power', 'organization', 'down', 'ages', 'connected', 'simple', 'decision', 'was', 'profound', 'still', 'is.The', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'gained', 'enormous', 'practical', 'advantages', 'due', 'decision', 'individual', 'men', 'including', 'ones', 'not', 'religious', 'way', 'connected', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'can', 'gain', 'same', 'advantages', 'making', 'same', 'decision.One', 'Comments', 'writer', 'discussing', 'movie', 'site', 'compared', 'La', 'Dolche', 'Vita', '1960', 'laundry', 'list', 'problems', 'different', 'types', 'women', 'provide', 'men', 'movie', 'Good', 'comparison.Women', 'are', 'attractive', 'often', 'especially', 'youth', 'so', 'are', 'favors', 'sometimes', 'provide', 'men.But', 'are', 'favors', 'price', 'men', 'pay', 'sometimes', 'demanded', 'women', 'sometimes', 'others', 'how', 'long', 'do', 'favors', 'keep', 'coming', 'what', 'level', 'quality', 'Are', 'women', 'price', 'men', 'pay', 'main', 'question', 'movies', 'Alfie', '1966', 'La', 'Dolche', 'Vita', '1960', 'present', 'ask.The', 'clear', 'answer', 'sadly', 'No', 'what', 'Alfie.', 'Written', 'Tex', 'Allen', 'SAG', 'Actor.Visit', 'WWW.IMDb.Me/TexAllen', 'Com', 'movie', 'credits', 'biographical', 'information', 'Tex', 'Allen.Email', 'Tex', 'Allen', 'TexAllen', '@', 'Rocketmail.Com']",N/A

567728,A1RECBDKHVOJMW,B000055ZF8,"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana""","[15, 15]","London was swinging in 1966. Mod fashion and the mini skirt were in vogue, discos featured the sound of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, Sean Connery starred in the latest James Bond 007 flick, drawing in crowds at the cinema, the counter culture was defining itself, the availability of medically prescribed contraceptives helped usher in the Sexual Revolution,  even though Women's Lib was still a ways off - and Director Lewis Gilbert's ""Alfie"" was released. It turned out to be the most talked-about, controversial film of the year, launching Michael Caine as an international film star, and earning five Oscar nominations. Although ""Alfie"" is very much a period piece, I saw it again recently and was tremendously surprised at how well it holds up, especially in the context of its time.Michael Caine's Alfie Elkins is the ultimate ladykiller, a sexual predator who approaches women and relationships the way a serial killer homes-in on a victim. He objectifies females, and many of his women are, indeed, victim-like in their neediness and vulnerability. This 30-something misogynistic, working-class, low-class playboy epitomizes narcissism, as he travels from ""bird"" to ""bird,"" single women and married alike, without responsibility or care, and without malice. And then he moves on to his next conquest. Michael Caine is superb and very believable as the reckless lover with the Cockney accent. His hard-core arrogance and brutal honesty, (with his monologues to the audience), are chilling and, at times, funny - but we're talking about very dark humor. This is a cold and distant man. Not to get too deep into psychology here, but Michael Caine is able to bring the depth of a damaged person to his outwardly cool cad of a character.The talented Mr. Caine couldn't pull-off this performance alone, however, so credit must be given to his supporting cast. Caine's counterparts are extremely credible, even by today's much more feminist and politically correct standards. These women are not Playboy Bunny types. A few of them are almost plain, and there is no cleavage except for the abundance of Shelly Winters.' Gilda (Julia Foster), is the working class woman, desperately in love with Alfie, who bears him a son out of wedlock. Although he states from the start that the baby is not his problem, he shows more affection to the child than he does to all his women combined. Vivien Merchant is excellent as Lily, the drab, lonely, married woman whom Alfie seduces and impregnates. She winds up having an abortion and, I must say, that the scenes surrounding this traumatic event are shocking in their emotional intensity, even in today's world. Annie, (Jane Asher) is the forlorn hitchhiker Alfie picks up and takes home to be his house maid, among other services. He winds up referring to her as ""it."" Shelly Winters is Ruby the vulgar older woman who dumps Alfie for a younger man.I watched a double feature of this 1966 version of ""Alfie"" with Michael Caine, and Alfie, 2005 with Jude Law. I was curious to compare the two movies. The only comment I will make here, because I believe it is pertinent, is that although I like Jude Law as an actor, the remake is nowhere near as effective as the original - which I highly recommend.JANA.",5,An Extraordinary Film - Superb Acting - Which Holds Up Today,1115078400,"05 3, 2005",2005,3253,"['London', 'was', 'swinging', '1966', 'Mod', 'fashion', 'mini', 'skirt', 'were', 'vogue', 'discos', 'featured', 'sound', 'Beatles', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'starred', 'latest', 'James', 'Bond', '007', 'flick', 'drawing', 'crowds', 'cinema', 'counter', 'culture', 'was', 'defining', 'availability', 'medically', 'prescribed', 'contraceptives', 'helped', 'usher', 'Sexual', 'Revolution', 'even', 'Women', 'Lib', 'was', 'still', 'ways', 'Director', 'Lewis', 'Gilbert', 'Alfie', 'was', 'released', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'most', 'talked-about', 'controversial', 'film', 'year', 'launching', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'international', 'film', 'star', 'earning', 'five', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'Alfie', 'very', 'much', 'period', 'piece', 'saw', 'again', 'recently', 'was', 'tremendously', 'surprised', 'how', 'well', 'up', 'especially', 'context', 'time.Michael', 'Caine', 'Alfie', 'Elkins', 'ultimate', 'ladykiller', 'sexual', 'predator', 'who', 'women', 'relationships', 'way', 'serial', 'killer', 'homes-in', 'victim', 'females', 'many', 'women', 'are', 'indeed', 'victim-like', 'neediness', 'vulnerability', '30-something', 'misogynistic', 'working-class', 'low-class', 'playboy', 'narcissism', 'bird', 'bird', 'single', 'women', 'married', 'alike', 'responsibility', 'care', 'malice', 'then', 'next', 'conquest', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'superb', 'very', 'believable', 'reckless', 'lover', 'Cockney', 'accent', 'hard-core', 'arrogance', 'brutal', 'honesty', 'monologues', 'audience', 'are', 'chilling', 'times', 'funny', ""'re"", 'talking', 'very', 'dark', 'humor', 'cold', 'distant', 'man', 'Not', 'get', 'too', 'deep', 'psychology', 'here', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'able', 'bring', 'depth', 'damaged', 'person', 'outwardly', 'cool', 'cad', 'character.The', 'talented', 'Mr.', 'Caine', 'could', ""n't"", 'pull-off', 'performance', 'alone', 'however', 'credit', 'must', 'be', 'given', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Caine', 'counterparts', 'are', 'extremely', 'credible', 'even', 'today', 'much', 'more', 'feminist', 'politically', 'correct', 'standards', 'women', 'are', 'not', 'Playboy', 'Bunny', 'types', 'few', 'are', 'almost', 'plain', 'cleavage', 'abundance', 'Shelly', 'Winters', 'Gilda', 'Julia', 'Foster', 'working', 'class', 'woman', 'desperately', 'love', 'Alfie', 'who', 'son', 'wedlock', 'start', 'baby', 'not', 'problem', 'more', 'affection', 'child', 'all', 'women', 'combined', 'Vivien', 'Merchant', 'excellent', 'Lily', 'drab', 'lonely', 'married', 'woman', 'whom', 'Alfie', 'seduces', 'impregnates', 'up', 'having', 'abortion', 'must', 'say', 'scenes', 'surrounding', 'traumatic', 'event', 'are', 'shocking', 'emotional', 'intensity', 'even', 'today', 'world', 'Annie', 'Jane', 'Asher', 'forlorn', 'hitchhiker', 'Alfie', 'up', 'home', 'be', 'house', 'maid', 'other', 'services', 'up', 'referring', 'Shelly', 'Winters', 'Ruby', 'vulgar', 'older', 'woman', 'who', 'Alfie', 'younger', 'man.I', 'watched', 'double', 'feature', '1966', 'version', 'Alfie', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Alfie', '2005', 'Jude', 'Law', 'was', 'curious', 'compare', 'two', 'movies', 'only', 'comment', 'will', 'make', 'here', 'believe', 'pertinent', 'like', 'Jude', 'Law', 'actor', 'remake', 'nowhere', 'near', 'as', 'effective', 'original', 'highly', 'recommend.JANA']",N/A

567735,A3J4RLCVPX0IO1,B000055ZF8,Matthew Romanchuk,"[12, 12]","Alfie is an interesting film: part comedy,part drama, part character study that makes use of an interesting narrative device-Michael Caine addresses the viewer directly and breaks the so called "" 4th wall"" which is humurous and also refreshing. It is one of the first contemporary films to do this and may in fact be the first one.  A year earlier Caine had done the excellent Zulu and now in 1964 paired with his effort in "" The Ipcress File"", stardom/superstardom beckoned. Caine's performance in Alfie is top notch: he creates a character that we like, are amused by, get angry at and feel sorry for. This is very difficult for an actor to achieve and only the best can pull it off.  Alfie is at first glance a buoyant cad, flitting from one affair to the next with little regard for the womans' feelings. It is made clear that he is after sex only and thinks he has no use for love. Most of the liasons are presented in a humurous light but there are several that are very dramatic and will tug at your heart.( In particular there is a wrenching scene where Alfie realizes his responsibility for his girlfriends' abortion) There is also a touching subplot where Alfie TRIES to be a good father to his son from a former girlfrind, but alas the girlfriend wants more than just a ""weekend"" father and Alfie is pushed to the side as she and a new man form their own family. For Alfie, this is a form of rejection and something he didn't count on- having deep feelings for the little boy. You can feel his regret and pain as he watches his son with the new dad. The tables have turned and now the taker is the taken. This feeling is further driven home by a relationship he has with a rich older woman played by Shelly Winters where things do not work out quite to his expectation. Thus, the story of Alfie is an odyssey of self discovery for a man that never really grew up and has learned at great cost the outcome of his casual lifestyle. The ending I think is optimistic in that it strongly implies Alfie has learned his lesson and will not be doing these selfdestructive and hurtful actions any longer. There is a heartwarming conclusion concerning a lost and lonely dog (that is seen several times in the movie) that will make you smile. The supporting cast is excellent across the board and mesh extremely well and the closing credits montage with CHER(!!!) singing the haunting/sweet/melancholy title tune is sublime. I truely believe that Alfie will appeal to many people and that they will appreciate and enjoy the richly textured performances by all the actors WITH A special nod to Michael Caine.",5,Michael Caine is excellent in breakthrough 60's role,1101254400,"11 24, 2004",2004,2607,"['Alfie', 'interesting', 'film', 'part', 'comedy', 'part', 'drama', 'part', 'character', 'study', 'use', 'interesting', 'narrative', 'device-Michael', 'Caine', 'viewer', 'directly', 'so', 'called', '4th', 'wall', 'humurous', 'also', 'refreshing', 'one', 'first', 'contemporary', 'films', 'do', 'may', 'fact', 'be', 'first', 'one', 'year', 'earlier', 'Caine', 'had', 'done', 'excellent', 'Zulu', 'now', '1964', 'paired', 'effort', 'Ipcress', 'File', 'stardom/superstardom', 'beckoned', 'Caine', 'performance', 'Alfie', 'top', 'notch', 'character', 'like', 'are', 'amused', 'get', 'angry', 'feel', 'sorry', 'very', 'difficult', 'actor', 'achieve', 'only', 'best', 'can', 'pull', 'off', 'Alfie', 'first', 'glance', 'buoyant', 'cad', 'flitting', 'one', 'affair', 'next', 'little', 'regard', 'womans', 'feelings', 'made', 'clear', 'sex', 'only', 'use', 'love', 'Most', 'liasons', 'are', 'presented', 'humurous', 'light', 'are', 'several', 'are', 'very', 'dramatic', 'will', 'tug', 'heart', 'particular', 'wrenching', 'scene', 'where', 'Alfie', 'responsibility', 'girlfriends', 'abortion', 'also', 'touching', 'subplot', 'where', 'Alfie', 'TRIES', 'be', 'good', 'father', 'son', 'former', 'girlfrind', 'girlfriend', 'more', 'just', 'weekend', 'father', 'Alfie', 'pushed', 'side', 'new', 'man', 'form', 'own', 'family', 'Alfie', 'form', 'rejection', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'count', 'on-', 'having', 'deep', 'feelings', 'little', 'boy', 'can', 'feel', 'regret', 'pain', 'son', 'new', 'dad', 'tables', 'have', 'turned', 'now', 'taker', 'taken', 'feeling', 'further', 'driven', 'home', 'relationship', 'rich', 'older', 'woman', 'played', 'Shelly', 'Winters', 'where', 'things', 'do', 'not', 'work', 'out', 'quite', 'expectation', 'Thus', 'story', 'Alfie', 'odyssey', 'self', 'discovery', 'man', 'never', 'really', 'grew', 'up', 'learned', 'great', 'cost', 'outcome', 'casual', 'lifestyle', 'ending', 'think', 'optimistic', 'strongly', 'Alfie', 'learned', 'lesson', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'doing', 'selfdestructive', 'hurtful', 'actions', 'longer', 'heartwarming', 'conclusion', 'concerning', 'lost', 'lonely', 'dog', 'seen', 'several', 'times', 'movie', 'will', 'make', 'smile', 'supporting', 'cast', 'excellent', 'board', 'mesh', 'extremely', 'well', 'closing', 'credits', 'montage', 'CHER', 'singing', 'haunting/sweet/melancholy', 'title', 'tune', 'sublime', 'truely', 'believe', 'Alfie', 'will', 'appeal', 'many', 'people', 'will', 'appreciate', 'enjoy', 'richly', 'textured', 'performances', 'actors', 'WITH', 'special', 'nod', 'Michael', 'Caine']",N/A

This is the movie that brought Michael Caine to world wide attention.Alfie (Caine) is a cockney limousine driver that is more interested in chasing the birds (women sort not feathered sort) than in work.  He has his own flock.  His regular birds and then he has a backup bird.  The only problem is that he has knocked up his backup bird and she wants to keep it.  At first Alfie doesn't want anything to do with little Malcolm but he quickly grows attached to the kid.  But since he doesn't want marry her so she goes to her backup guy!Even after Alfie is diagnosed with a respiratory ailment, he chats up the sisters (nurses).  Upon his return, he takes up street photography where he meets a sassy American, Ruby (Shelly Winters - between Oscar wins).  Alfie goes back to visit his hospital roommate and winds up chatting up his wife and knocks her up (potent guy).Alfie goes back to limousine driving and picks up a hitchhiker on the road.  She moves in with Alfie and becomes his housekeeper and backup girl.  He finally throws her out but realizes too late what he is losing.Alfie takes up with Ruby but finds out that she is the female version of him.  And when he catches her with another guy, she tells him that ""he's younger than you are"".The film ends with a great performance of Alfie by Cher.The film is based on a play by Bill Naughton (who adapted it).  The play has Alfie as narrator and commentator. Naughton kept this for the movie.  While this usually works on stage as the audience is part of the immediacy, it usually does not work on film.  But in this case, Alfie's narration or observances of life add to plot.  Director Lewis Gilbert handles the film and its, at that time, controversial subject matter with great ease.DVD EXTRAS: None",4,What's it all about Mikie,1137369600,"01 16, 2006",2006,1781,"['What', 'movie', 'brought', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'world', 'wide', 'attention.Alfie', 'Caine', 'cockney', 'limousine', 'driver', 'more', 'interested', 'chasing', 'birds', 'women', 'sort', 'not', 'feathered', 'sort', 'work', 'own', 'flock', 'regular', 'birds', 'then', 'backup', 'bird', 'only', 'problem', 'knocked', 'up', 'backup', 'bird', 'keep', 'first', 'Alfie', ""n't"", 'want', 'anything', 'do', 'little', 'Malcolm', 'quickly', 'attached', 'kid', ""n't"", 'want', 'marry', 'so', 'backup', 'guy', 'Even', 'Alfie', 'diagnosed', 'respiratory', 'ailment', 'up', 'sisters', 'nurses', 'return', 'up', 'street', 'photography', 'where', 'sassy', 'American', 'Ruby', 'Shelly', 'Winters', 'Oscar', 'wins', 'Alfie', 'back', 'visit', 'hospital', 'roommate', 'up', 'chatting', 'up', 'wife', 'up', 'potent', 'guy', '.Alfie', 'back', 'limousine', 'driving', 'up', 'hitchhiker', 'road', 'Alfie', 'housekeeper', 'backup', 'girl', 'finally', 'out', 'too', 'late', 'what', 'losing.Alfie', 'up', 'Ruby', 'out', 'female', 'version', 'when', 'guy', 'younger', 'are', '.The', 'film', 'great', 'performance', 'Alfie', 'Cher.The', 'film', 'based', 'play', 'Bill', 'Naughton', 'who', 'adapted', 'play', 'Alfie', 'narrator', 'commentator', 'Naughton', 'kept', 'movie', 'usually', 'stage', 'audience', 'part', 'immediacy', 'usually', 'not', 'work', 'film', 'case', 'Alfie', 'narration', 'observances', 'life', 'add', 'plot', 'Director', 'Lewis', 'Gilbert', 'film', 'time', 'controversial', 'subject', 'matter', 'great', 'ease.DVD', 'EXTRAS', 'None']",N/A

567747,A2HJB9J5O5CLPB,B000055ZF8,R. A Rubin,"[3, 7]","I saw this one back in the 60's and remembered it.  It was a young man's dream-comes-true on screen and pretty racy after the Hollywood Film Code collapsed.  However, my head was full of mush back then because clearly, I missed all the sadness in this story of the rogue cockney and his ladies.  The year of the film, 1966, is significant because swinging London was happening and mini-skirted tarts roamed London with Rolling Stone bad boys. Alfie is a 30ish fellow that was of the pre-60's generation of Hugh Hefner, 1950's wanna-be's.  He loves them and leaves them.  Alfie is a good talker and his young pregnant girlfriend loves his abusive banter. Alfie is amusing and there's plenty of mid-sixties sex jokes, double meanings, but all the tough guy-docile female antics are dated.  These quaint attitudes are an archeological dig of pre-feminism.  There is an exception.  Shelley Winters is terrific as the hot-to-trot American widow that gives Alfie more than he bargained for.There is a backroom abortion scene, which horrified my wife and I.  We saw it differently.  Alfie has a stint in a hospital ward and befriends a middle-class fellow who lives for his once a day visit, his dowdy wife.  You guessed it: Alfie beds Dowdy wife (wonderful Vivian Merchant ) and the pregnancy must be terminated.  The uncharacteristic abortionist asks questions of morality.  The woman has a rough one and the aborted baby haunts Alfie.  I thought these scenes rang of anti-abortion sentiment.

567748,A3VO05LD5WSO9F,B000055ZF8,Robert Hayes,"[0, 0]","ALFIE is a somewhat dated, but still engaging dramedy, with a star-making performance by Michael Caine. The film is about Alfie, a Cockney ladies' man with commitment issues, and the audience is personally led through his life by him breaking the fourth wall and addressing us directly. This is useful on a couple of levels. First, it is amusing that he can do that without his female companions being any wiser, but it also allows the viewer to connect with him in a much deeper way. As Alfie is a rather unlikeable character, save for a couple scenes where he shows some genuine emotion, the way in which he directly communicates with the audience is key in laying bare the character's motivation, regardless of whether or not you agree with what he does. Early on in the film, there is a sly comedic tone set which carries throughout most of the running time, until it takes a turn for the melodramatic. I didn't particularly like the direction it went, but it did serve a narrative and character-building purpose. I also felt like Alfie's comeuppance was handled rather well. Overall, this was a good movie, though occasionally slightly tedious. Michael Caine's performance is the real draw here. Still, there was a nice soundtrack and closing credits song by Cher.

567751,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B000055ZF8,Stephanie De Pue,"[35, 35]","""Alfie,"" released in 1966, is considered one of the most famous, influential movies of that decade.  It's credited with being a classic study of the 60's, and introducing London to the world, just as it began to swing.  Also with making a big star of its star, Michael Caine, although by this time Caine had already starred in ""The Ipcress File,"" and stolen ""Zulu,"" a dandy war movie, out from under Stanley Baker.  No matter, ""Alfie"" is still considered the sexy, handsome young Caine's star-making turn.  The part, that of a London cockney lad about town, is one he was born to: he was, in fact, born to be a Covent Garden barrow boy (that is, a man selling fruits and vegetables from a wheelbarrow in the open-air market), as was his father before him.Alfie (Caine) is a London limo driver, a job that enables him to meet girls, girls, girls, and he does.  Uses them, abuses them, moves on.  The movie's based on the stage play of the same name by Bill Naughton, who adapted it for the screen, and was directed by Lewis Gilbert.  It won five Oscar nominations, seven other awards, and 16 more miscellaneous nominations.  Terence Stamp, cockney himself, and possibly the handsomest man alive at that time, was playing the title role on Broadway, but refused the movie, as he thought it ""too immoral.""  Filmed on location in London and environs, Naughton ""opened up"" the play by adding many Thamesside scenes, making the mighty river another, mood-setting, reminding-us-of-eternity, character.  Denholm Elliott has one unforgettable scene; Sydney Tafler and other cockney types provided Caine with excellent support; some of the women in Alfie's life were played by Shelley Winters, Jane Asher, Shirley Anne Field, Vivien Merchant, and Eleanor Bron.When the movie first opened, it was accompanied only by a jazzy Sonny Rollins score.  To sweeten things up a bit, the famous, award-winning song, ""What's It All About, Alfie,"" was commissioned from Burt Bacharach and Hal David.  The song, done by Cher for the American market, and Cilla Black for the English, was spliced into the movie.  (Of course, Dionne Warwick had the big hit with it, on both sides of the Atlantic.)  The song, however, is not an accurate summation of the movie, as it is generally considered.  The song famously asks, ""Is it just for the moment we live?  Are we meant to take more than we give?""  Well, Alfie, as Caine plays him, knows that he's been trying to live only for the moment, and that he's been taking far more than he's been giving, and he knows where it's gotten him.He knows that he dislikes women -- calls them ""birds,"" and occcasionally, jarringly, ""it.""  But he knows their power.  He knows he has no education, money or position, and a woman such as the doctor Eleanor Bron plays has no interest in him.  He knows he's alone, and getting older; were he to forget, Shelley Winters, in the part she was born to play, a rich American, is there to remind him.  He knows that he's lost two sons, one by a second-stringer of his who married a nice man to get the support she needed.  One by the character played by the greatly-admired Vivien Merchant, a married woman who feels an abortion is necessary.The scene where Alfie recognizes just what abortion means is the most powerful in the movie.  ""You reap what you sow,"" is the lesson he's forced to relearn, and it's a painful one.  At the end of the movie, he stands and faces the camera, says he's gotten the better of the many women in his life, and yet, they've moved on, presumably to happiness, and he has nothing, not even his ""peace of mind.""

Moving from one ""it"" (his term for girl - almost an abstraction) to another - no commitments or attachments and only an ""honest"" assessment that love is illusory or at best fleeting and therefore ""the moment"" is king. Alfie is caught in the crossfire of birth and death and refuses to confront either because he cannot understand the relationship of the past and future to his present. Alfie is the eternal mischievous boy who has charmed his way in and out of trouble (and women's underwear) his entire existence. An astute observer of the folly and frailty of human emotion, he is content to remain on the outside, unaware that there might be something of value superseding immediate gratification. As the film progresses, Alfie's charm is wearing thin and he starts experiencing the fallout from his years of shallow depravity. On those rare occasions when he chooses to confront the unfortunate but inevitable consequences of his behavior, he is disgusted and ashamed but ultimately unable to put these feelings of revulsion into a context and therefore continues his detached existence in ignorance. But he's no longer funny. In fact, by the films close, Alfie has become painfully sad. A flawed film in many ways (the ludicrous bar-room brawl comes to mind), ALFIE nevertheless succeeds primarily due to Michael Caine's performance. His ability to take the audience with him, as co-conspirators, in a lascivious game that is both intoxicating and shameful is remarkable. Unfortunately, while the emptiness of his character has had a sobering effect on us, Alfie has learned nothing of the experience and helplessly asks us, ""What's it all about?""",3,Excellent performance from Michael Caine,1106784000,"01 27, 2005",2005,1746,"['What', 'ALFIE', 'were', 'ask', 'principle', 'character', ""'d"", 'probably', 'say', 'freedom', 'Moving', 'one', 'term', 'girl', 'almost', 'abstraction', 'commitments', 'attachments', 'only', 'honest', 'assessment', 'love', 'illusory', 'best', 'fleeting', 'therefore', 'moment', 'king', 'Alfie', 'caught', 'crossfire', 'birth', 'death', 'confront', 'either', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'relationship', 'past', 'future', 'present', 'Alfie', 'eternal', 'mischievous', 'boy', 'who', 'charmed', 'way', 'trouble', 'women', 'underwear', 'entire', 'existence', 'astute', 'observer', 'folly', 'frailty', 'human', 'emotion', 'content', 'remain', 'outside', 'unaware', 'might', 'be', 'something', 'value', 'superseding', 'immediate', 'gratification', 'film', 'Alfie', 'charm', 'wearing', 'thin', 'experiencing', 'fallout', 'years', 'shallow', 'depravity', 'rare', 'occasions', 'when', 'confront', 'unfortunate', 'inevitable', 'consequences', 'behavior', 'disgusted', 'ashamed', 'ultimately', 'unable', 'put', 'feelings', 'revulsion', 'context', 'therefore', 'detached', 'existence', 'ignorance', 'no', 'longer', 'funny', 'fact', 'films', 'close', 'Alfie', 'become', 'painfully', 'sad', 'flawed', 'film', 'many', 'ways', 'ludicrous', 'bar-room', 'brawl', 'mind', 'ALFIE', 'nevertheless', 'primarily', 'due', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'performance', 'ability', 'take', 'audience', 'co-conspirators', 'lascivious', 'game', 'intoxicating', 'shameful', 'remarkable', 'Unfortunately', 'emptiness', 'character', 'had', 'sobering', 'effect', 'Alfie', 'learned', 'nothing', 'experience', 'helplessly', 'What']",N/A
567753,AZWMGBRZ3GYG,B000055ZF8,Thomas Aquinas,"[5, 7]","In the late 1960s, a cultural critic made the following prediction regarding the direction of male/female relationships in the age of The Pill. ""First consider how easily...  [birth control]... could open wide the way for marital infidelity and a general lowering of moral standards. Not much experience is needed to be fully aware of human weakness and to understand that human beings--and especially the young, who are so exposed to temptation--need incentives to keep the moral law... Another effect that gives cause for alarm is that a man who grows accustomed to the use of contraceptive methods may forget the reverence due to a woman, and, disregarding her physical and emotional equilibrium, reduce her to being a mere instrument for the satisfaction of his own desires, no longer considering her as his partner whom he should surround with care and affection.""Alfie does nothing but reduce women to mere instruments for the satisfaction of his own desires. His lack of consideration for his partners' well-being could be breathtakingly cruel. Alfie seduces the wife of a hospitalized man, a man who lives for his wife's occasional visits. Alfie leaves the same woman alone, and in extreme physical and emotional pain, after she undergoes the illegal abortion of his own child. This extreme callousness was not caused by the The Pill, but was made possible by The Pill, a chemical which was approved as an oral contraceptive in Britain in 1962, four years prior to the making of this movie. This correlation is not coincidental. While evil and selfishness pre-date the Sixties' sexual revolution, widespread, and culturally-accepted promiscuity, did not.It is possible to argue that Alfie didn't use The Pill, since two of his conquests became pregnant. But this is improbable, since Alfie was nothing if not self-centered, and he certainly did not want to bear the responsibilities of fatherhood (as evidenced by the abortion). It is far more likely that these pregnancies were ""accidents.""But what explains Alfie's inhumanity and cruelty? Aside from The Fall, one can view Alfie as the product of a post-Christian society, a society in the early stages of moral decay. While both men and women here have justly judged Alfie to be a vile misogynist (and misanthropist -he doesn't hesitate to steal the girlfriend of a friend), how many people here can honestly say that they are equally appalled by the promiscuity and vacuity of the women portrayed in ""Sex in the City""? Is there any difference? Certainly not in the behavior of the main characters. To quote a Doobie Brother's album title, ""What Were Once Vices Are Now Habits."" The only, and enormously important difference between the two dramas, is that ""Alfie"" presents the other side of the ""Sex in the City"" story --a very dark side-- but a very real side, and, sadly, the dominant side. It is this adherence to truth that sets ""Alfie"" apart from most sex farces, and it is what makes ""Alfie"" the canary in the coal mine regarding the on-rushing sexual revolution.If you haven't guessed already, the ""cultural critic"" noted above, was Pope Paul VI, cited from the almost universally reviled encyclical, ""Humanae Vitae (On Human Life).""

The result was that some of Caine's most engaging moments came when he spoke directly to the camera in his Cockney tone, replete with lower middle class slang.The film was released in the sexually liberated sixties, revealing the flip side of what happens when a selfish man pursues pleasure at all costs.  When Caine's affair with Julia Foster results in the birth of a son he takes great pride in being a father, but not to the point where he is willing to marry her and assume full responsibilities of fatherhood.  Instead he visits his son, provides him with gifts, and wheels him around London in a baby carriage.  When Foster accepts the proposal of marriage from a sincere man she does not love, but who loves her, Caine cries foul and feels he has been mistreated.After a temporary lung illness confines Caine to a sanatorium he has an affair with the wife of a friend he meets inside who is recovering from tuberculosis,impregnating her.  The scene where an abortion is performed by Denholm Elliott is done with a grim and gripping realism.  It is Elliott's sole scene in the film and he makes it count.The cocky Caine ultimately receives his just desserts from the irrepressible Shelley Winters after engaging in selfish conduct with numerous women.  He decides that he would like to pursue the relationship with wealthy American Winters on an extended level.  When he arrives at her flat he discovers a young man in his twenties with a guitar sitting silently in another room.  When Caine asks in a wounded tone just what this young man has that he doesn't, she coolly responds, ""He's younger than you.""  She then asks him for the key she had given him to her apartment during a more blissful period in their relationship.After his rejection by Winters, Caine stands on Thames Embankment on a quiet evening looking perplexed, his only companion a stray dog who likes his company.  At the film's close a perplexed Alfie, wounded from rejection, faces the camera and asks, relative to the overarching question of life itself, ""What's it all about?""This was one of the great British films dealing with the sexual revolution of the sixties, where it ranks alongside John Schlesinger's epic, ""Sunday, Bloody Sunday,"" which was released just after the controversial decade ended, in 1971.",5,Caine's Launching Pad,1015891200,"03 12, 2002",2002,3054,"['Alfie', 'proved', 'be', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'launching', 'pad', 'international', 'stardom', 'film', '1966', 'release', 'subsequent', 'rave', 'notices', 'occurring', 'one', 'year', 'made', 'starring', 'debut', 'Ipcress', 'File', 'playing', 'Len', 'Deighton', 'colorfully', 'unconventional', 'British', 'agent', 'Harry', 'Palmer.Director', 'Lewis', 'Gilbert', 'be', 'given', 'tremendous', 'credit', 'using', 'successful', 'technique', 'Irish', 'playwright', 'Bill', 'Naughton', 'successful', 'London', 'West', 'End', 'play', 'having', 'male', 'star', 'Alfie', 'directly', 'audience', 'process', 'revealing', 'lack', 'character', 'thorough', 'one-sidedness', 'evaluation', 'personal', 'relationships', 'women', 'naysayers', 'sought', 'convince', 'Gilbert', 'soliloquy', 'better', 'left', 'stage', 'drama', 'will', 'not', 'work', 'cinema', 'result', 'was', 'Caine', 'most', 'engaging', 'moments', 'came', 'when', 'spoke', 'directly', 'camera', 'Cockney', 'tone', 'replete', 'lower', 'middle', 'class', 'slang.The', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'sexually', 'liberated', 'sixties', 'revealing', 'flip', 'side', 'what', 'when', 'selfish', 'man', 'pleasure', 'costs', 'When', 'Caine', 'affair', 'Julia', 'Foster', 'results', 'birth', 'son', 'great', 'pride', 'being', 'father', 'not', 'point', 'where', 'willing', 'marry', 'assume', 'full', 'responsibilities', 'fatherhood', 'Instead', 'son', 'gifts', 'wheels', 'around', 'London', 'baby', 'carriage', 'When', 'Foster', 'proposal', 'marriage', 'sincere', 'man', 'not', 'love', 'who', 'Caine', 'foul', 'feels', 'been', 'mistreated.After', 'temporary', 'lung', 'illness', 'confines', 'Caine', 'sanatorium', 'affair', 'wife', 'friend', 'who', 'recovering', 'tuberculosis', 'impregnating', 'scene', 'where', 'abortion', 'performed', 'Denholm', 'Elliott', 'done', 'grim', 'gripping', 'realism', 'Elliott', 'sole', 'scene', 'film', 'count.The', 'cocky', 'Caine', 'ultimately', 'just', 'desserts', 'irrepressible', 'Shelley', 'Winters', 'engaging', 'selfish', 'conduct', 'numerous', 'women', 'would', 'like', 'pursue', 'relationship', 'wealthy', 'American', 'Winters', 'extended', 'level', 'When', 'flat', 'young', 'man', 'twenties', 'guitar', 'sitting', 'silently', 'room', 'When', 'Caine', 'wounded', 'tone', 'just', 'what', 'young', 'man', ""n't"", 'coolly', 'younger', 'then', 'key', 'had', 'given', 'apartment', 'more', 'blissful', 'period', 'relationship.After', 'rejection', 'Winters', 'Caine', 'Thames', 'Embankment', 'quiet', 'evening', 'looking', 'perplexed', 'only', 'companion', 'stray', 'dog', 'who', 'company', 'film', 'close', 'perplexed', 'Alfie', 'wounded', 'rejection', 'camera', 'asks', 'relative', 'overarching', 'question', 'life', 'What', 'was', 'one', 'great', 'British', 'films', 'dealing', 'sexual', 'revolution', 'sixties', 'where', 'alongside', 'John', 'Schlesinger', 'epic', 'Sunday', 'Bloody', 'Sunday', 'was', 'released', 'just', 'controversial', 'decade', 'ended', '1971']",N/A
