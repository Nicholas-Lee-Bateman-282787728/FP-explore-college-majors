Well, it is, except, it is not a B-movie, and it is funny! The not well-known cast of 100 Women adds to the movie. There are no stereotypes about the characters only about the story.A very bright and likable student is on a mission to find a girl he met in a blackout. His problem; he doesn't know who she is or what she looks like! He leaves no stone unturned in his effort to find that girl, the girl of his dreams. In the process, a co-ed friend talks him into cross-dressing to understand what a women experience. This experience actually helps him mature in a college way, and develops respect for women realizing how men can be so primitive. Shame on males for being so primitive acting the way they do! Like we needed another movie to confirm what we already know. 100 Women is another movie about college kids experiencing their liberation from parents. However, this movie unlike similar movies works. 100 Women is worth watching. There are many memorable one-liners will keep you laughing. This movie is worthy of it R rating and parental guidance is strongly advised.",4,It will keep you laughing!,1044921600,"02 11, 2003",2003,1181,"['first', 'thought', 'B-movie', 'horny', 'control', 'college', 'kids', 'experiencing', 'life', 'Well', 'not', 'B-movie', 'funny', 'not', 'well-known', 'cast', '100', 'Women', 'movie', 'are', 'stereotypes', 'characters', 'only', 'story.A', 'very', 'bright', 'likable', 'student', 'mission', 'find', 'girl', 'met', 'blackout', 'problem', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'what', 'stone', 'unturned', 'effort', 'find', 'girl', 'girl', 'dreams', 'process', 'co-ed', 'friend', 'talks', 'cross-dressing', 'understand', 'what', 'women', 'experience', 'experience', 'actually', 'mature', 'college', 'way', 'respect', 'women', 'realizing', 'how', 'men', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'primitive', 'Shame', 'males', 'being', 'so', 'primitive', 'acting', 'way', 'do', 'needed', 'movie', 'confirm', 'what', 'already', 'know', '100', 'Women', 'movie', 'college', 'kids', 'experiencing', 'liberation', 'parents', 'However', 'movie', 'similar', 'movies', 'works', '100', 'Women', 'worth', 'watching', 'are', 'many', 'memorable', 'one-liners', 'will', 'keep', 'laughing', 'movie', 'worthy', 'R', 'rating', 'parental', 'guidance', 'strongly', 'advised']",100 Women

Each are realistic in their depiction of a young man seeking genuine love & sex but this movie is about Sam who's a dexterity-challenged art student having the worst day of his life when a streak of fate & a gust of wind blows Hope ( a young woman )across his path. Hope cheers him up- restoring his faith in life. The next time the Sam meets Hope-she's living in a woman's residence & is irreversibly depressed. Sam embarks on a mission to restore her zest for life. Along the way, Sam finds the smile he's been looking for in the last place he thought he would ever find it. Chad Donella,Erinn Bartlett,Jennifer Morrison, Clint Howard, Steve Monroe. By the Writers & directors of "" 8 days a Week"" & "" 100 Girls"".

738644,A1W0ODR0SK9H4R,B00008DDS9,LeftManOut,"[5, 5]","Like it has been said before in other reviews, the movie ""100 Women"" has nothing to do with the movie ""100 Girls."" They are written and directed by the same person, but that is all that really links the movies together. There are a lot of things about this movie that make it one of the best unknown comedies around. The cast of characters is a relatively small and unknown one, however everyone in the movie plays their parts perfectly. My hat goes off to LGF for once again bringing us one of the best comedies around.The movie follows Sam, who's an art student who is in despair over his favorite teacher telling him that he has no hope of being an artist. Sam is all but ready to give up his dream, until a young woman named Hope comes across his path one day, and decides to cheer him up. The two instantly hit it off, and Hope writes her phone number on Sam's hand. Unfortunately it is raining and the number gets washed off. Sam then has to find Hope again. When he finally does encounter her, there's something far different about her personality. She's not the genial girl he met in the road, and now he is determined to help her ""get her smile back"". Along the way Sam ends up finding love in the last place he would have expected to. Just like ""100 Girls"" there's plenty of memorable dirty jokes and scenes and gags(including an epic snot shooting battle, a burping fight, a chinese finger trap gone wrong, and a girl who uses her pager for something totally different than you would think), and the cast is very likeable. There's also a lot of social commentary on our society and our stereotypes. These are meld together to make one of the best underground comedies I've seen in quite sometime.This is highly recommended for anyone who was a fan of ""100 girls"" or ""8 Days A week"", or anyone who is into romantic comedies, who can be as soft as they are dirty. All in all I think most will find themselves satisfied by the viewing experience, and maybe even find one of their newest favorite movies. While I still prefer ""100 Girls"" (but then again I probably always will) that doesn't detract anything from this movie. Snag a copy today and start enjoying the laughs right away.",5,Don't miss this one,1129680000,"10 19, 2005",2005,2191,"['been', 'said', 'other', 'reviews', 'movie', '100', 'Women', 'nothing', 'do', 'movie', '100', 'Girls', 'are', 'written', 'directed', 'same', 'person', 'really', 'movies', 'together', 'are', 'lot', 'things', 'movie', 'make', 'one', 'best', 'unknown', 'comedies', 'cast', 'characters', 'relatively', 'small', 'unknown', 'one', 'however', 'everyone', 'movie', 'parts', 'perfectly', 'hat', 'LGF', 'once', 'again', 'bringing', 'one', 'best', 'comedies', 'around.The', 'movie', 'Sam', 'who', 'art', 'student', 'who', 'despair', 'favorite', 'teacher', 'telling', 'hope', 'being', 'artist', 'Sam', 'ready', 'give', 'up', 'dream', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Hope', 'path', 'one', 'day', 'cheer', 'up', 'two', 'instantly', 'hit', 'off', 'Hope', 'phone', 'number', 'Sam', 'hand', 'raining', 'number', 'washed', 'off', 'Sam', 'then', 'find', 'Hope', 'again', 'When', 'finally', 'encounter', 'something', 'far', 'different', 'personality', 'not', 'genial', 'girl', 'met', 'road', 'now', 'determined', 'help', 'get', 'smile', 'back', 'way', 'Sam', 'up', 'finding', 'love', 'last', 'place', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'Just', '100', 'Girls', 'plenty', 'memorable', 'dirty', 'jokes', 'scenes', 'gags', 'including', 'epic', 'snot', 'shooting', 'battle', 'burping', 'fight', 'chinese', 'finger', 'trap', 'gone', 'wrong', 'girl', 'who', 'pager', 'something', 'totally', 'different', 'would', 'think', 'cast', 'very', 'likeable', 'also', 'lot', 'social', 'commentary', 'society', 'stereotypes', 'are', 'meld', 'together', 'make', 'one', 'best', 'underground', 'comedies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quite', 'sometime.This', 'highly', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'who', 'was', 'fan', '100', 'girls', '8', 'week', 'anyone', 'who', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'as', 'soft', 'are', 'dirty', 'think', 'most', 'will', 'find', 'satisfied', 'viewing', 'experience', 'maybe', 'even', 'find', 'one', 'newest', 'favorite', 'movies', 'still', 'prefer', '100', 'Girls', 'then', 'again', 'probably', 'always', 'will', ""n't"", 'detract', 'anything', 'movie', 'Snag', 'copy', 'today', 'start', 'enjoying', 'laughs', 'right', 'away']",100 Women
