676178,AEKZL04PZT00E,B00005QW6I,"Alberta Camus ""AlCa""","[6, 6]","John Thompson is the essence of a natural Existentialist.  I will watch this film again just to observe Thompson's (the Robert Mitchum character's) responses to the situations which confront him.  Essentially this is a film about an escaped convict and his die-hard hunter played by Wilford Brimley.  Kathleen York, is such a chameleon as an actress, that I'd believed I'd never seen her before in anything, but she is always working, it seems, and is also a talented writer.  In this film she transforms herself into a carelessly emotional and unsophisticated young woman who one would worry about due to her spontaneous choices and complete abandon.  It is unusual that one finds characters so well rounded as to inspire real interest in what is to befall them.  Is this due to good writing (writer, John Carlen, d.2009)? the acting?  According to IMDB: ""His [Carlen's] time in prison as a male hustler and a bank robber served as inspiration for some of his film scripts. He began writing while in jail"".Without film tricks, car crashes, bombs, perspiring actors, blaring music, etc., this viewer's interest was consistent from beginning to end.  When Thompson finds a high stakes card game, the precedent for his quick insight into other players has been set up previously in the carnival scene in which he observes a carnival hustler cheating his young nephew.  This situation of protecting innocence, which he also does with his flighty niece, makes him a heroic bad guy.  Even after reminding myself that this man did not only steal from crooks, but also hard working folks, I still didn't want him to get caught.  Why ""Existentialism""? -- because one of the major tenets is that everything is about choice.  We choose, even if we choose not to choose.  Thompson chooses to choose.  Even with the possibility of losing, he chooses, he decides.  Unlike choices one makes often in life, his choices could mean complete downfall.  In that aspect, this movie inspires one to find one's own private courage to navigate the world unmasked, deciding to decide, win or lose.",4,MORE EXISTENTIAL THAN CAMUS,1382313600,"10 21, 2013",2013,2073,"['John', 'Thompson', 'essence', 'natural', 'Existentialist', 'will', 'watch', 'film', 'again', 'just', 'observe', 'Thompson', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', 'character', 'situations', 'confront', 'Essentially', 'film', 'escaped', 'convict', 'die-hard', 'hunter', 'played', 'Wilford', 'Brimley', 'Kathleen', 'York', 'such', 'chameleon', 'actress', ""'d"", 'believed', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'anything', 'always', 'working', 'also', 'talented', 'writer', 'film', 'carelessly', 'emotional', 'unsophisticated', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'one', 'would', 'worry', 'due', 'spontaneous', 'choices', 'complete', 'abandon', 'unusual', 'one', 'characters', 'so', 'well', 'rounded', 'inspire', 'real', 'interest', 'what', 'befall', 'due', 'good', 'writing', 'writer', 'John', 'Carlen', 'd.2009', 'acting', 'According', 'IMDB', '[', 'Carlen', ']', 'time', 'prison', 'male', 'hustler', 'bank', 'robber', 'served', 'inspiration', 'film', 'scripts', 'began', 'writing', 'jail', '.Without', 'film', 'tricks', 'car', 'crashes', 'bombs', 'perspiring', 'actors', 'blaring', 'music', 'etc.', 'viewer', 'interest', 'was', 'consistent', 'beginning', 'end', 'When', 'Thompson', 'high', 'stakes', 'card', 'game', 'precedent', 'quick', 'insight', 'other', 'players', 'been', 'set', 'up', 'previously', 'carnival', 'scene', 'carnival', 'hustler', 'cheating', 'young', 'nephew', 'situation', 'protecting', 'innocence', 'also', 'flighty', 'niece', 'heroic', 'bad', 'guy', 'Even', 'reminding', 'man', 'did', 'not', 'only', 'steal', 'crooks', 'also', 'hard', 'working', 'folks', 'still', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'caught', 'Why', 'Existentialism', 'one', 'major', 'tenets', 'everything', 'choice', 'choose', 'even', 'choose', 'not', 'choose', 'Thompson', 'choose', 'Even', 'possibility', 'losing', 'choices', 'one', 'often', 'life', 'choices', 'could', 'mean', 'complete', 'downfall', 'aspect', 'movie', 'one', 'find', 'one', 'own', 'private', 'courage', 'navigate', 'world', 'unmasked', 'deciding', 'decide', 'win', 'lose']",Thompson's Last Run
