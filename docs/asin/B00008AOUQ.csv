737328,AVYCUAENA5PAO,B00008AOUQ,Erin,"[4, 8]","The plot and story is pretty simple and straight forward and it never fails to amaze me how movies will ignore the obvious to get a product out there. Is that vague? Basically what I'm saying is that there are some obvious plot holes that could have been done away with.There are some decent performances in here but they're kind of uneven and it feels like the cast isn't trying to hard most of the time. So why would I recommend this? Mark Dacascos of course!On the acting side, Mark is trying to move into roles that require a little more characterization but unfortunately a movie of this type only allows a brief hint of that. Character study takes a back seat to action, which is also pretty sparse. I do think Mark put up a valiant effort, but it seems a little more emotion in certain areas would have made his performance more convincing. Tim Abell gives a fair performance as the protagonist, but as with Mark, there's some scenes that are played too detached for what's happening.What we do have for action is pretty decent for the most part. There's a fight towards the end which shows off some new moves from Mark which are worth watching. But as with Drive, using a stunt double in certain scenes is both unnecessary and detracting from the experience. I believe it's James Lew, who's a great martial artist in his own right, but he's just not Mark.I'd say this is something that hardcore Mark Dacascos fans might enjoy most. I still think casual watchers would be interested, but would probably do better to get Crying Freeman, Only the Strong, Drive or Brotherhood of the Wolf.",3,"Not Mark's best, but still enjoyable",1077494400,"02 23, 2004",2004,1593,"['plot', 'story', 'pretty', 'simple', 'straight', 'forward', 'never', 'amaze', 'how', 'movies', 'will', 'ignore', 'obvious', 'get', 'product', 'there', 'vague', 'Basically', 'what', ""'m"", 'saying', 'are', 'obvious', 'plot', 'holes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'away', 'are', 'decent', 'performances', 'here', ""'re"", 'kind', 'uneven', 'cast', ""n't"", 'trying', 'hard', 'most', 'time', 'So', 'why', 'would', 'recommend', 'Mark', 'Dacascos', 'course', 'acting', 'side', 'Mark', 'trying', 'move', 'roles', 'require', 'little', 'more', 'characterization', 'unfortunately', 'movie', 'type', 'only', 'brief', 'hint', 'Character', 'study', 'back', 'seat', 'action', 'also', 'pretty', 'sparse', 'do', 'think', 'Mark', 'put', 'up', 'valiant', 'effort', 'little', 'more', 'emotion', 'certain', 'areas', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'performance', 'more', 'convincing', 'Tim', 'Abell', 'fair', 'performance', 'protagonist', 'Mark', 'scenes', 'are', 'played', 'too', 'detached', 'what', 'do', 'have', 'action', 'pretty', 'decent', 'most', 'part', 'fight', 'end', 'new', 'moves', 'Mark', 'are', 'worth', 'watching', 'Drive', 'using', 'stunt', 'double', 'certain', 'scenes', 'unnecessary', 'detracting', 'experience', 'believe', 'James', 'Lew', 'who', 'great', 'martial', 'artist', 'own', 'right', 'just', 'not', 'Mark.I', ""'d"", 'say', 'something', 'hardcore', 'Mark', 'Dacascos', 'fans', 'might', 'enjoy', 'most', 'still', 'think', 'casual', 'watchers', 'would', 'be', 'interested', 'would', 'probably', 'do', 'better', 'get', 'Crying', 'Freeman', 'Only', 'Strong', 'Drive', 'Brotherhood', 'Wolf']",N/A

Tim Abell plays and quite well, a psychotic cop who has murdered nine women, and who failed in his attempt to murder his wife (the lovely if challenged Melissa Crider), and has been sentenced to an institution for the criminally insane.  Needless to say, he escapes and begins searching for his wife for ultimate revenge.  Ms. Crider is referred to a freelance defense instructor, played by Mark Dascascos, and he agrees to help her ready herself to defend herself against this psycho spouse.

737333,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B00008AOUQ,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[2, 2]","Considering that he was just coming off of his role in the worldwide hitBrotherhood of the Wolf, ""Instinct to Kill"" is a disappointingly average DTV film as far as leading man Mark Dacascos is concerned: despite having proven that he can carry both cinematic weight and demanding physicality, this movie asks very little of him by relying heavily on a story that neither touches the audience particularly nor remains true to the book it's based on (The Perfect Husband: A Novelby Lisa Gardner). Sure, it's a decent thematic outing for the rest of the cast, but seeing as Dacascos had just become a (temporary) household name, it's inexcusable how the mediocre production hindered the possibilities his casting presented.The story: Tess Beckett (Missy Crider,The Sex Monster) unknowingly married a murderer and barely escapes with her life before her testimony puts him behind bars. However, when Jim (Tim Abell,The Base) escapes from prison and goes after his former wife, she enlists the help of self-defense expert J.T. Dillon (Dacascos) to protect and train her.The cast also includes Kadeem Hardison as the policeman who hooks up Tess with Dillon. Fans of either will know that Hardison and Dacascos had excellent chemistry in the excellent kung fu flickDrive, but they retain none of this for ""Instinct"": they only have a couple scenes together and don't inspire more than run-of-the-mill performances out of eachother. In fact, Hardison's entire role seems unnecessary, since he doesn't really do much while he's on the screen...but then again, nobody can hold a candle to the presence of Tim Abell's character, which quickly becomes the most interesting part of the movie. See, not only is he basically evil on two legs and a certified master of disguise (the latter is a huge part of the movie), but he kicks Mark Dacascos' butt...a lot. I'm thoroughly unconvinced that a man of his size could withstand what Dacascos deals out, but sure enough, not only is he grinning away after receiving blows that have felled many a movie bad guy, but he's promptly putting the hurt on the Hawaiian black belt as though it were easy. Ugh.Speaking of putting a hurt on someone, I'm sorry to say that not only is there not a lot of hand-to-hand fighting (a total of three scenes, I think), but what's there is not very good. The fights were choreographed by B-movie staple James Lew, who's an amazing athlete but has apparently been in so many atrocious fight scenes that they've rubbed off on him: restricting camera angles and poorly-transitioned stunts put a damper on some cool moves by both men and the fight spectacle as a whole.Missy Crider does well in her acting (with the exception of playing out the forced romance between herself and J.T., but Dacascos stumbles here, too), but the role she plays is clich&eacute;d and pathetic: I'm not unfamiliar with the psychological impact on spousal abuse, but the movie is at least half an hour longer than it would've been if she weren't such a wimp who needs to wait until the last two minutes of the movie to become courageous. As far as the mighty Jim goes...well, he's just not very likable. Yes, I know he's the bad guy - and a very advantaged one, at that - but as far as him being a core character goes, I just wanted to see him die. His death toll is surprisingly high, and he kills a lot of nice people; I almost turned off the film simply because I knew that he wasn't to get a proper comeuppance until the end, after all of the cruel things he's done. I mean, at least Hannibal Lecter and Norman Bates were fascinating to watch; Jim just needs to friggin' die, man.""Instinct to Kill"" tries to be an action-packed take onEnough, but in the end, the action isn't good and the film itself isn't very likable. It's definitely not on the need-to-get lists of Dacascos fans.

The movie starts by showing her marriage go sour and how violent her husband is. She finds a body part hidden in the house and calls the cops and they find out he killed many women.

Kadeem Hardison plays a cop and sends Tess to learn self defense from Marc Dacascos.The story itself is bad, but the acting is pretty good. Melissa Crider is pitiful, but Dacascos is good, and the husband (played by Tim Abell) does some very good work. And that is literally the only good thing about the movie. There is no real training except for Tess learning to use a gun. The story just drags along while Tim Abell performs very well in badly directed scenes.Since at least 90% of the stuff I watch is fighting movies, I can excuse a bad story and bad directing. Like I said, the acting is pretty good, so I was hoping for some good action, and I would be happy. The fights are shot so close up and are so choppy that it becomes aggravating to watch. I liked the final fight, but 2 or 3 good scenes does not make a movie. The last straw for me was when Tess is pointing a gun at an armed man, and after all her training, she holds her gun sideways. I don't remember her learning any sideways gun techniques, but I will admit I had a hard time paying attention for most of the movie.1.5/5DVD from DEJ Productions is full screen and picture quality is not bad, but could be better.
