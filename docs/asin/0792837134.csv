137951,A383RRF34W2UFS,0792837134,Audra Thomas,"[4, 7]","I wonder if this film REALLY ends as beautifully... and as positively,  as so many of its viewers  are led to believe... or are we swept-along (manipulated) by the outstanding performances, the high-romanticism of the film and/or its truly outstanding and iconic musical score ? (Ms.Davis always was concerned that Max Steiner's musical accompaniment would dominate the scene, subjugating her performance; at the end of  DarkVictory, Ms.Davis, ""on behalf"" of her character, Judith, now blind, is reputed to have asked the director, ""now is Max Steiner going to go up these stairs... or am I ?"" )None of this is by-means of diminishing the outstanding performances this film offers, and that of Ms.Davis must be acknowledged as perhaps her most incandescently splendid. She gives us a glimpse into at least four separate segments of Charlotte Vale's ever-evolving life, each one refined and complete unto itself, and each different one from the other, almost as if a different actor were portraying each chronologically separate facet of one single life: the young Charlotte on the steamship journey with her mother... so young, pretty and fresh, her life ahead of her; the crushed-down ""Aunt Charlotte"" of middle-age, when she has become so dominated by her ruthless mother as to become lost with-in herself... a dowdy shadow awaiting her inevitable nervous breakdown; the fledgling Charlotte reclaiming, hesitatingly, her life while at Cascade under the guidance of good Dr,Jacquiff; the just-reborn Charlotte, out on-her-own, really, for the first time in her life, on the post-Cascade ocean voyage to South America, during which she meets Jerry; the stronger... and growing ever-increasing so, self-confident and self-reliant independent woman, returning to Boston (and to the tyranny of her mother), much more the graceful swan than the ugly duckling of before; and perhaps finally, the ""healed"" Charlotte, after re-raising/re-parenting herself, by serving as the nurturing, supportive and loving surrogate mother-figure to Tina... certainly the mother-figure Charlotte, herself, had never had.... and here is the problem: I say ""the `healed' Charlotte"" fully-believing that Charlotte will never be completely healed... that it would not be possible that she become completely healed... ever. Her damage is rooted far too deep, as it started, methodically, to be put in-place by her mother from early in Charlotte's life, and that it would, by now, be imprinted so very deeply into her very fiber as to be part of who she is... and who she will always be. The ""healed"" Charlotte will go-forward in life, and from this point onward, less crippled than she was, and though she may now walk on her own,her healing cannot be complete, nor can it make-up for the damage that was in-place from so very long before. Sadly, like so many ruined people, her destiny was put in-place and molded by parental abuse; she is better than she was... much better, but I believe that Charlotte will never know happiness, as it is a state with which she is totally unfamiliar; it is alien to her. As such, she will reject, by-rote, any opportunity to ""be happy""; she understands abuse... but not kindness, not compassion and certainly not love. And, to keep herself safe from happiness...Charlotte creates a ""boxed-in"" situation for herself...Selflessly caring for and dedicated to the traumatized Tina ( who IS still young enough to be ""saved""), the daughter of her love, Jerry, Charlotte understands that she and Jerry can never be together, as her surrogate parenting of Tina forbids such a relationship with her lover as inappropriate.The good Dr.Jacquiff requires acceptance of this understanding between Charlotte and Jerry as the condition by-which Charlotte may continue in her role as Tina's ""mother"". As such, Charlotte is ""saved"" from ever having to become too close to Jerry... ""saved"" from ever being happy with the man she loves.I also have a problem with Jerry...... smooth, charming and handsome to be sure, and very clever with cigarettes, but also selfish and self-absorbed... and he's a bit too much the self-righteous martyr for my taste. His weak and stilted protestation alluding to Charlotte's self-sacrifice to Tina (by-which he is all but assured that Charlotte will remain unattached to any other man, as the strong link of Tina will always bind Charlotte to him), is pure selfishness and thoughtlessness. Charlotte will remain in a kind of emotional ""no man's land"", neither here, nor there, linked to Jerry... but not ever really connected to him. Charlotte has relegated herself into an illusionary safety zone of a self-imposed emotional isolation. Interestingly, in an extended one-person-interview with Dick Cavett, on his 1971 television show, MissDavis also acknowledged that she 'played Judith as understanding that Jerry could not be for her, because he was too weak, envisioning that Judith would wind up marrying Dr. Jacquith in the end' (!)(This interview is available on a DVD set of the more significant Cavett interviews during the run of his 70s series; the DVD set includes the interview with Ms.Davis, as well as that with Ms.KatherineHepburn, RobertMitchum, DebbieReynolds, and Groucho)Yes, to be certain, Now,Voyager is a truly iconic film, strongly retaining its well-deserved worthiness for almost seventy years; it is replete with superb performances, led by Ms.Davis, admirably foiled by Gladys Cooper as her tyrant of a mother, et al . However... I still wonder if this wonderful film leads the viewer to a false sense of ""happy ending""... by means of the very excellence that has ensured its place in cinematic history.",5,"Yes, truly... an

137952,ANGH6401L9Y0T,0792837134,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[5, 5]","I decided I could not site a single thing wrong with this movie to justify cutting that last star off. It may or may not be the best movie Bette Davis ever made, but it's close enough to count.Charlotte Vale (Bette Davis) is the browbeaten daughter of an overbearing Boston matriarch who had her late in life and apparently did not want her. She is treated like a servant, with the difference that she cannot quit. Her sister invites Dr. Jaquith (Claude Rains) to visit, and suggests they not let on that he is a noted psychiatrist. But mother lets the cat out of the bag in no time, and makes it quite clear to the good doctor exactly why Charlotte is so depressed, self-loathing, bitter. He tells her mother that she is gravely ill and suggests she come to his sanitarium for a few weeks.Once there, free of her mother at last, she does well until the doctor suggests she is improving so much she could go home soon. Her reaction to this convinces him to suggest she take an ocean cruise instead. It was very smart of him.She got the last available stateroom due to a last-minute cancellation by a popular performer apparently known to Charlotte, although perhaps she was a radio performer or a singer, because no one seems to know what she looks like. So when Charlotte comes on board, they call her by the French lady's name. Also, the glamorous lady's wardrobe was already on board, so Charlotte could use her clothes. In fact, there were little notes pinned on them encouraging Charlotte to use them, and suggesting which shoes go with which outfit, and so on.Also on board this cruise is Jerry Durrance (Paul Henreid), unhappily married, father of two, and a frustrated architect. Naturally these two are attracted to each other. Wouldn't be much of a story if they weren't.At the ship's layover in Rio, Jerry and Charlotte hire a (very incompetent) driver to take them up the mountainside to see some tourist attraction. But the driver manages to tumble them over the side of the hill, and goes off to get help. Charlotte and Jerry thus spend the night together in an abandoned shack on the mountainside, where it is so cold they have to ""bundle"" together to keep warm.Jerry was staying in Rio on business, but Charlotte was supposed to have gotten back on the cruise ship. When it is obvious she has missed it, they decide to stay in Rio together for five days, when she can then fly to the next port of call of the ship and continue her cruise. By the time she gets on that plane, they are most desperately in love.Of course, Charlotte knows he is married, and that he's too much of a gentleman to hurt his wife. Old friends of his were on the cruise, too, and told her what he had not already told her about his home life. So when they part in Rio, neither one expects to see the other again. But that's not quite halfway through the movie, which lets the audience know they will see each other again.Once again, Charlotte retreats to Dr. Jaquith's sanitarium, and makes friends with the sad little girl in the next bedroom who reminds her so completely of herself as a repressed and unwanted child.",5,Grabbed and Kept My Attention,1336780800,"05 12, 2012",2012,3110,"['decided', 'could', 'not', 'site', 'single', 'thing', 'wrong', 'movie', 'justify', 'cutting', 'last', 'star', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'best', 'movie', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'ever', 'made', 'close', 'enough', 'count.Charlotte', 'Vale', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'browbeaten', 'daughter', 'overbearing', 'Boston', 'matriarch', 'who', 'had', 'late', 'life', 'apparently', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'her', 'treated', 'servant', 'difference', 'can', 'not', 'quit', 'sister', 'invites', 'Dr.', 'Jaquith', 'Claude', 'Rains', 'visit', 'not', 'let', 'noted', 'psychiatrist', 'mother', 'cat', 'bag', 'time', 'quite', 'clear', 'good', 'doctor', 'exactly', 'why', 'Charlotte', 'so', 'depressed', 'self-loathing', 'bitter', 'mother', 'gravely', 'ill', 'come', 'sanitarium', 'few', 'weeks.Once', 'there', 'free', 'mother', 'last', 'well', 'doctor', 'improving', 'so', 'much', 'could', 'go', 'home', 'soon', 'reaction', 'suggest', 'take', 'ocean', 'cruise', 'instead', 'was', 'very', 'smart', 'him.She', 'got', 'last', 'available', 'stateroom', 'due', 'last-minute', 'cancellation', 'popular', 'performer', 'apparently', 'known', 'Charlotte', 'perhaps', 'was', 'radio', 'performer', 'singer', 'one', 'know', 'what', 'So', 'when', 'Charlotte', 'board', 'call', 'French', 'lady', 'name', 'Also', 'glamorous', 'lady', 'wardrobe', 'was', 'already', 'board', 'Charlotte', 'could', 'use', 'clothes', 'fact', 'were', 'little', 'notes', 'pinned', 'encouraging', 'Charlotte', 'use', 'suggesting', 'shoes', 'go', 'outfit', 'so', 'on.Also', 'board', 'cruise', 'Jerry', 'Durrance', 'Paul', 'Henreid', 'unhappily', 'married', 'father', 'two', 'frustrated', 'architect', 'Naturally', 'two', 'are', 'attracted', 'other', 'Would', ""n't"", 'be', 'much', 'story', ""weren't.At"", 'ship', 'layover', 'Rio', 'Jerry', 'Charlotte', 'hire', 'very', 'incompetent', 'driver', 'take', 'up', 'mountainside', 'see', 'tourist', 'attraction', 'driver', 'tumble', 'over', 'side', 'hill', 'off', 'get', 'help', 'Charlotte', 'Jerry', 'thus', 'spend', 'night', 'together', 'abandoned', 'shack', 'mountainside', 'where', 'so', 'cold', 'have', 'bundle', 'together', 'keep', 'warm.Jerry', 'was', 'staying', 'Rio', 'business', 'Charlotte', 'was', 'supposed', 'have', 'gotten', 'back', 'cruise', 'ship', 'When', 'obvious', 'missed', 'decide', 'stay', 'Rio', 'together', 'five', 'days', 'when', 'can', 'then', 'fly', 'next', 'port', 'call', 'ship', 'continue', 'cruise', 'time', 'plane', 'are', 'most', 'desperately', 'love.Of', 'course', 'Charlotte', 'married', 'too', 'much', 'gentleman', 'hurt', 'wife', 'Old', 'friends', 'were', 'cruise', 'too', 'told', 'what', 'had', 'not', 'already', 'told', 'home', 'life', 'So', 'when', 'part', 'Rio', 'one', 'see', 'other', 'again', 'not', 'quite', 'halfway', 'movie', 'audience', 'know', 'will', 'see', 'other', 'again.Once', 'again', 'Charlotte', 'Dr.', 'Jaquith', 'sanitarium', 'friends', 'sad', 'little', 'girl', 'next', 'bedroom', 'who', 'so', 'completely', 'repressed', 'unwanted', 'child']",N/A

Of course, I don't find any of it believable, but hey, it's Hollywood in 1942 so they are not going to tackle the hard stuff.Charlotte Vale (Davis) has some serious problems.  Her mother (Gladys Cooper) says so.  Many times.  Charlotte hides in her room, smokes and drinks, whittles ivory boxes, and looks awful.  But a psychiatrist comes for tea and immediately wants to whisk her off to some nursing home in Vermont.  The family agrees to this.  And off she goes.And guess what?  Turns out that Charlotte wasn't crazy at all, just had to get away from her domineering mother, get a new ""do"" and splashy wardrobe.  Oh yes, and go on a cruise and have sex.  Good sex.But it is while she is on this cruise that I find the film to be.  Too.  Long.  It drags, and I really don't care about ""Tina"", her lover's child.  The film gets a bit ponderous around this part.  But, since Bette is ""cured"" (of what????), she can help the young and mousy Tina, who is just as mousy as Charlotte used to be.  Of course, Tina is about 11 or so while Charlotte is well into her thirties, and ""cured"" overnight by that new hairdo, new wardrobe, and new feelings in her lady-parts.Davis was justly nominated for an Oscar for her portrayal of the disturbed Charlotte who transforms herself into a stunner and loses all traces of whatever ""mental illness"" she was supposed to have.  Like I said, in 1942 Hollywood isn't going to tackle the hard stuff.  (Wouldn't it have been interesting to leave Charlotte in her mother's house and have the two go at it and find out what REALLY is the matter?).  Nope.  It's Hollywood.  It's 1942.  Get a new hairdo, a new wardrobe, and go out into the world and have sex.

137956,A3VZVYWCTGIEV0,0792837134,"Bill Your 'Free Form FM Print DJ ""bill nicholas""","[1, 1]","I just introduced myself to Bette Davis with this film in an effort to  learn about movies before 1960.Brilliant: a women controlled completely by her mother has a break down and then goes on a cruise. She meets a man who is married and has a daughter. They fall in love but don't pursue the relationship. Later in the film she ends up caring for his child and though they could act on their romance, they decide to sublimate it in favor of centering their love for the child.What struck me here is how different the times were: if this were to happen, say, in 1960 or after, there would be almost no question of the two getting married. But this was 1942. Now Voyager is really about people adhering to strict moral and social codes back when these were sacred. Their considerations of their needs as individuals were secondary.You see this in a million ways:  there is very nuanced sexual energy here, such as when the couple shares cigarettes, but it is all deep in subtext. Bette  Davis' character refuses to leave her mother-and feels guilty when she dies, despite the mothers horrible treatment of her. Impulses are repressed, barley acknowledged, never mind acted onThis type of theme threads back through drama: Romeo and Juliet, Age Of Innocence, stories where people are completely bound by expectations you would never consider today.

Despite being surrounded by wealth and privilege, her life is in shambles.Enter psychiatrist Dr. Jaquith, played by the delightful Claude Rains, and a stay at his luxurious sanitarium far away from her mother, and Charlotte's life is transformed.Weight loss, an eyebrow trim and a heavy dose of self-confidence and Charlotte is transformed into a true beauty. Her next adventure is to take a cruise on her own with her new self. Soon she finds true love and brief romance with the very much married Jerry, played by a dashing but somber Paul Henreid.Charlotte's life is changed for ever through a love that can only continue in her heart and dreams. She returns to her mother's home with a new sense of independence and Jerry forever in her heart.At this point, the story begins to drag. The beauty in this film is Charlotte's blossoming into a fine and lovely lady with a future.

Max Steiner did so and it then became: ""Wrong, Can It Be Wrong To Kiss,"" which became a number one hit on jukeboxes across America.In fact, Max Steiner reprised this unforgettable tune in l943's ""Mildred Pierce"", starring Davis' archrival, Joan Crawford in several intimate love scenes between Crawford and Zachary Scott.To watch ""Now, Voyager"" today is impossible to imagine without Steiner's shimmering music, although I think his scoring on another Bette Davis masterpiece, ""Dark Victory"" is just as memorable. His final Bette Davis Score for the extraordinary ""Beyond the Forest"", Bette's last movie for Warner's in l949, is phenomenal. Unfortunately, certain release rights prevent this amazing classic to be sold as a DVD although I have a cherished version on VHS.What makes Charlotte Vale a real iconic movie character is that Bette Davis was not afraid to make herself look hideous in the beginning stages of her character's mental depression.

His therapy, of course, is simply reframing her vision of herself.

It is one of the most tender, and profound, heartrending love storys, that I have ever seen! Eventhough, the movie was in black and white, I didn't care, It was outstanding!This movie is about a woman named Charlotte, who was a overweight ugly ducking, who became a beautiful woman, in spite of the fact, that Charlotte had a very overbearing, hateful mother.A kind doctor helped Charlotte with her sadness, and Charlotte ended up going on a vacation, on a cruise ship, there Charlotte met and fell in love with a very handsome man named Jerry, but Jerry was a married man, but he was still, so in love with Charlotte! And Charlotte was so in love with him, she was in love for the first time in her life!(Betty Davis) who played Charlotte, and (Paul Henreid) who played Jerry, was awesome!I loved the chemisty between them, you could almost feel the overpowering love, that they felt for each other in this movie!One of my favorite scenes is when Jerry tells Charlotte, ""If only I was free, there would be only one thing that I would want to do, and that would be to prove that you are not immune to happiness!"" I'd show you, that you deserve to be loved!"" And I liked the way Jerry lit two cigarettes, at the same time!I loved the beautiful, soul stirring music of Max Steiner! Wow! I LOVED the scene at the end of the movie where Jerry tells Charlotte, after they talked, to let's have a cigarette on it, and then the way Jerry lit two cigarettes, and looked at Charlotte, with his beautiful self! Oh! My! For some reason to me, that was one of the most sexy, profound, loving, romantic moments in a movie that I have ever seen, when Jerry and Charlotte was smoking they looked like they were actually speaking to each other, and yet for that brief moment they did not speak no words; you could feel and see all this intense emotion, and love!
