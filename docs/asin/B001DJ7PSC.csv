I got this movie, because Mischa Barton was in it, and in my opinion, she is one of the most beautiful women in the world. She is also a good actor. However, I was blown away by this movie, because it is so much more than I expected. It covers two periods--the 1940s and currently, and in two different countries--the United States and Ireland.A young woman (Mischa Barton) sends her newly married husband off to World War II, never to see him again. Shirley MacLaine plays the young woman grown old with time. The story is told through flashbacks to her earlier life, and cutaways to present day Ireland.Christopher Plummer is excellent as the older version of the boy who wanted to marry her himself, but she was in love with his friend. He came back from the war, and has stood by her the ensuing decades even though she ultimately married another man.This is a story about love. The losing of it, and coming to terms with that loss late in life. This is a surprising good movie no one every heard of.",4,"A Story of Love, Loss, and redemption",1268006400,"03 8, 2010",2010,1085,"['story', 'was', 'written', 'real', 'event', 'happened', 'finding', 'ring', 'got', 'movie', 'Mischa', 'Barton', 'was', 'opinion', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'women', 'world', 'also', 'good', 'actor', 'However', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'expected', 'two', 'periods', '1940s', 'currently', 'two', 'different', 'countries', 'United', 'States', 'Ireland.A', 'young', 'woman', 'Mischa', 'Barton', 'newly', 'married', 'husband', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'never', 'see', 'again', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'young', 'woman', 'grown', 'old', 'time', 'story', 'told', 'flashbacks', 'earlier', 'life', 'cutaways', 'present', 'day', 'Ireland.Christopher', 'Plummer', 'excellent', 'older', 'version', 'boy', 'who', 'wanted', 'marry', 'was', 'love', 'friend', 'came', 'back', 'war', 'stood', 'ensuing', 'decades', 'even', 'ultimately', 'married', 'man.This', 'story', 'love', 'losing', 'coming', 'terms', 'loss', 'late', 'life', 'surprising', 'good', 'movie', 'one', 'heard']",Closing the Ring

Wong,"[0, 0]","After viewing this British/Canadian production on DVD, the question arises why can't films like this suffer from poor distribution here in the States?  Surely, the reputations of Lord Attenborough (Gandhi, Jurassic Park, Young Winston), Shirley McLaine and Christopher Plummer would've been enough to insure distribution here in the US.  But unfortunately what we get here is basically crap like the latest horror film or franchise--and so much of it is negative.  The cast and its director should be commended on delivering a poignant love story for adults--there hasn't been much on the screen these days since the success of ""The Notebook""---and I think this film is even better than that box office success.  Plummer himself is very moving in the final moments of this fine film and McLaine also delivers as a stoic, repressed widower with some secrets of her own.  The young actors that portray them are also excellent with special mention of Mischa Barton who if a lucky producer sees her in this film should have a career like Rachel McAdams (The Notebook).

Speaking of Petes, Pete Postelwaithe is here, too!), I thought it might be worth a go.  And while the cast and crew do a serviceable job for the most part (ranging anywhere from great to poor), it's the script that really kills this one.  More specifically, the dialogue.  There is a good story somewhere in here (maybe a great story), but the words actually spoken are quite often so trite, cliched and cornball that not even such magnificent actors as Christopher Plummer and Shirley MacLaine can overcome it.

Certainly the storyline kept me involved, desiring to see how the characters might reclaim and reconcile love which had been shattered 50 years earlier in the violence and devastation of WWII.

And anyone who sees the movie must admit the all-star cast and crew bring a level of talent difficult to surpass, thereby increasing the probability this one could have been a great movie.  But I think the movie failed to achieve its potential greatness because at the most fundamental level the writing wasn't great, and a weak screenplay prevented a great story from becoming a great movie.That being said, it's still a movie worth watching as I think it can - in some way - perhaps bring some understanding to our younger generations as to how personal the losses of WWII were to that generation, including the many lost loves.",3,"Quite good, but potentially so much more",1321488000,"11 17, 2011",2011,1054,"['was', 'quite', 'good', 'movie', 'really', '3.9', 'star', 'rating', 'just', 'shy', 'four', 'stars', 'Certainly', 'storyline', 'kept', 'involved', 'desiring', 'see', 'how', 'characters', 'might', 'reclaim', 'reconcile', 'love', 'had', 'been', 'shattered', '50', 'years', 'earlier', 'violence', 'devastation', 'WWII', 'intertwining', 'young', 'old', 'generations', 'cultures', 'modern-day', 'modern', 'history', 'gave', 'story', 'great', 'potential', 'success', 'anyone', 'who', 'movie', 'must', 'admit', 'all-star', 'cast', 'crew', 'bring', 'level', 'talent', 'difficult', 'surpass', 'thereby', 'increasing', 'probability', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'movie', 'think', 'movie', 'failed', 'achieve', 'potential', 'greatness', 'most', 'fundamental', 'level', 'writing', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'weak', 'screenplay', 'prevented', 'great', 'story', 'becoming', 'great', 'movie.That', 'being', 'said', 'still', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'think', 'can', 'way', 'perhaps', 'bring', 'understanding', 'younger', 'generations', 'how', 'personal', 'losses', 'WWII', 'were', 'generation', 'including', 'many', 'lost', 'loves']",Closing the Ring

I was very pleased with the movie - it is a poignant story that deals with the themes of love, loss, redemption and healing.The story begins with a memorial for WW II vet, Chuck Norris in a small town in the US. His daughter Marie [Neve Campbell] is grief-stricken but her mother, Chuck's widow Ethel [Shirley Maclaine] seems unmoved and casually smokes outside the funeral hall. She is joined by Chuck's good friend Jack [Christopher Plummer] and we are taken back via flashback to the 1940s when Ethel[Mischa Barton] was a young girl in love with Teddy [Stephen Amell] and whose close friends are Jack [Gregory Smith] and Chuck [David Alpay]. All three men are in love with Ethel, but it's Teddy who wins Ethel's heart. When WW II begins, the boys go off to war, but not before a secret marriage between Ethel and Teddy. When Teddy gets killed in action whilst flying over Belfast,Ireland Ethel is grief-stricken and comforted by Jack and Chuck.Back in the present, Ethel finds herself reminiscing about the past to herself, but is surly and silent with her daughter Marie who is bewildered by her mother's lack of grieving over Chuck's death. It is only when a young Irish lad Jimmy [Martin McCann] finds the gold wedding ring belonging to Teddy on Black Mountain in Belfast and contacts Ethel, that the past starts to unravel and Ethel finds herself having to confront some hard truths, including some surprising revelations.The story itself flows well and the plot is cohesive. I did find the sub-plot in the present with the IRA conflict in Northern Ireland [and Jimmy's inadvertent involvement in it] a bit distracting, but it did prove important in tying the loose ends together at the end.The acting by the leads was very convincing, especially by Maclaine and Plummer as the older Ethel and Jack. The actors playing the younger roles back in the 1940s also did a credible job, especially Mischa Barton as the young Ethel.Martin McCann as young Jimmy was quite adorable in his role as the naive Irish lad with a tendency towards plain speaking. There are nude scenes in this movie [Ethel as played by Mischa] and some violence [bombings and shootings by the IRA and also government agents].All in all, I found ""Closing the Ring"" to be a well-acted romance/family drama and would recommend it to fans of the genre.",4,"A beautiful tale of love, loss and healing",1233360000,"01 31, 2009",2009,2504,"['picked', 'up', 'movie', 'rental', 'other', 'day', 'mainly', 'was', 'directed', 'Sir', 'Richard', 'Attenborough', 'also', 'had', 'Shirley', 'Maclaine', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'was', 'very', 'pleased', 'movie', 'poignant', 'story', 'deals', 'themes', 'love', 'loss', 'redemption', 'healing.The', 'story', 'memorial', 'WW', 'II', 'vet', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'small', 'town', 'US', 'daughter', 'Marie', '[', 'Neve', 'Campbell', ']', 'grief-stricken', 'mother', 'Chuck', 'widow', 'Ethel', '[', 'Shirley', 'Maclaine', ']', 'unmoved', 'casually', 'smokes', 'funeral', 'hall', 'joined', 'Chuck', 'good', 'friend', 'Jack', '[', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', ']', 'are', 'taken', 'back', 'flashback', '1940s', 'when', 'Ethel', '[', 'Mischa', 'Barton', ']', 'was', 'young', 'girl', 'love', 'Teddy', '[', 'Stephen', 'Amell', ']', 'close', 'friends', 'are', 'Jack', '[', 'Gregory', 'Smith', ']', 'Chuck', '[', 'David', 'Alpay', ']', 'three', 'men', 'are', 'love', 'Ethel', 'Teddy', 'who', 'Ethel', 'heart', 'When', 'WW', 'II', 'boys', 'go', 'off', 'war', 'not', 'secret', 'marriage', 'Ethel', 'Teddy', 'When', 'Teddy', 'killed', 'action', 'whilst', 'flying', 'Belfast', 'Ireland', 'Ethel', 'grief-stricken', 'comforted', 'Jack', 'Chuck.Back', 'present', 'Ethel', 'reminiscing', 'past', 'herself', 'surly', 'silent', 'daughter', 'Marie', 'who', 'bewildered', 'mother', 'lack', 'grieving', 'Chuck', 'death', 'only', 'when', 'young', 'Irish', 'lad', 'Jimmy', '[', 'Martin', 'McCann', ']', 'gold', 'wedding', 'ring', 'belonging', 'Teddy', 'Black', 'Mountain', 'Belfast', 'contacts', 'Ethel', 'past', 'starts', 'unravel', 'Ethel', 'having', 'confront', 'hard', 'truths', 'including', 'surprising', 'revelations.The', 'story', 'well', 'plot', 'cohesive', 'did', 'find', 'sub-plot', 'present', 'IRA', 'conflict', 'Northern', 'Ireland', '[', 'Jimmy', 'inadvertent', 'involvement', 'bit', 'distracting', 'did', 'prove', 'important', 'tying', 'loose', 'together', 'end.The', 'acting', 'leads', 'was', 'very', 'convincing', 'especially', 'Maclaine', 'Plummer', 'older', 'Ethel', 'Jack', 'actors', 'playing', 'younger', 'roles', 'back', '1940s', 'also', 'did', 'credible', 'job', 'especially', 'Mischa', 'Barton', 'young', 'Ethel.Martin', 'McCann', 'young', 'Jimmy', 'was', 'quite', 'adorable', 'role', 'naive', 'Irish', 'lad', 'tendency', 'towards', 'plain', 'speaking', 'are', 'nude', 'scenes', 'movie', 'Ethel', 'played', 'Mischa', ']', 'violence', '[', 'bombings', 'shootings', 'IRA', 'also', 'government', 'agents', ']', '.All', 'found', 'Closing', 'Ring', 'be', 'well-acted', 'romance/family', 'drama', 'would', 'recommend', 'fans', 'genre']",Closing the Ring
