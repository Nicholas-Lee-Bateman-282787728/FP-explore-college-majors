806217,AHXIZAR2XAKV4,B0001I55LU,"D. Best ""misfit_debbie""","[0, 0]","Back before MTV got all Jersey Shore on us there was The Osbournes. A show that looked into the life of Ozzy Osbourne, his wife Sharon, son Jack, and daughter Kelly. I of course bought every season because I am a lifelong fan of Ozzy and Sharon. After watching this show you kind of get a feel of what Ozzy's life is kind of like. I know that this show was really like thousands of hours or so and they just edited the crap out of it but it's actually pretty addicting when you start watching it. It's full of humor, alot of Kelly and Jack drama, and well Ozzy. The way they end season 2 1/2 is so great. You have to see it! It's not like every other episode and it will have you so fooled:)",4,"A great ""reality"" series",1275436800,"06 2, 2010",2010,691,"['Back', 'MTV', 'got', 'Jersey', 'Shore', 'was', 'Osbournes', 'show', 'looked', 'life', 'Ozzy', 'Osbourne', 'wife', 'Sharon', 'son', 'Jack', 'daughter', 'Kelly', 'course', 'bought', 'season', 'am', 'lifelong', 'fan', 'Ozzy', 'Sharon', 'watching', 'show', 'kind', 'get', 'feel', 'what', 'Ozzy', 'life', 'kind', 'know', 'show', 'was', 'really', 'like', 'thousands', 'hours', 'so', 'just', 'edited', 'crap', 'actually', 'pretty', 'addicting', 'when', 'start', 'watching', 'full', 'humor', 'alot', 'Kelly', 'Jack', 'drama', 'well', 'Ozzy', 'way', 'end', 'season', '2', '1/2', 'so', 'great', 'have', 'see', 'not', 'like', 'other', 'episode', 'will', 'have', 'so', 'fooled']",The Osbournes - The 2 1/2 Season

Yeah it was crude, had more profanity than anything Ive ever seen,  the kids were downright obnoxious but you cant blame people for how they acted when they were kids, people change.I think the shows hilarious.  After ive had a bad day or someones been bustin my chops its great to go home and pop in one of the dvds and have a laugh.  I also have alot of respect for sharon being brave enough to let people see what went on when she went through her battle with colon cancer.  Im sure alot of cancer patients were comforted by that.When i first heard about this show yeah i thought ozzy has sold out but then i got into it.  The only thing that I just didnt get on the show was how Jack fixated on Black Sabbath.  It was like he was perfectly happy to live in his dads shadow as ozzy osbournes son, milking his dads fame to do whatever he wanted.  Im a firm believer in the ""get a life of your own"" way of life, make your own acomplishments. The whole im in no hurry to move out of the house, im gonna keep staying here and live rent free (which in a house that size with a big beautiful pool, an arcade, a gymn and a a big room with just about anything a guy could want, that wouldnt be much of a sacrifice.)  He may have made a life of his own by now though, i really dont see him in much of anything anymore.  I think he works somewhere in the record business.celebrity kids do have one major advantage though, they screw up big and pick themselves back up and get their lives straight they still land killer jobs but in the ""not so hollywood"" world, you can screw up when your young and people, schools and jobs are gonna be busting your chops for the rest of your career. coming from a teenage screw up grown up straitened up and fighting tooth and nail trying to get into medical school, i can say it doesnt work that way for everybody.",5,great show,1312848000,"08 9, 2011",2011,1863,"['loved', 'show', 'Yeah', 'was', 'crude', 'had', 'more', 'profanity', 'anything', 'Ive', 'ever', 'seen', 'kids', 'were', 'downright', 'obnoxious', 'cant', 'blame', 'people', 'how', 'acted', 'when', 'were', 'kids', 'people', 'change.I', 'think', 'shows', 'hilarious', 'ive', 'had', 'bad', 'day', 'someones', 'been', 'bustin', 'chops', 'great', 'go', 'home', 'pop', 'one', 'dvds', 'have', 'laugh', 'also', 'have', 'alot', 'respect', 'sharon', 'being', 'brave', 'enough', 'let', 'people', 'see', 'what', 'went', 'when', 'went', 'battle', 'colon', 'cancer', 'Im', 'sure', 'alot', 'cancer', 'patients', 'were', 'comforted', 'that.When', 'i', 'first', 'heard', 'show', 'i', 'thought', 'ozzy', 'sold', 'out', 'then', 'i', 'got', 'only', 'thing', 'just', 'didnt', 'get', 'show', 'was', 'how', 'Jack', 'fixated', 'Black', 'Sabbath', 'was', 'was', 'perfectly', 'happy', 'live', 'dads', 'shadow', 'ozzy', 'osbournes', 'son', 'milking', 'dads', 'fame', 'do', 'whatever', 'wanted', 'Im', 'firm', 'believer', 'get', 'life', 'own', 'way', 'life', 'make', 'own', 'acomplishments', 'whole', 'im', 'hurry', 'move', 'house', 'im', 'gon', 'keep', 'staying', 'here', 'live', 'rent', 'free', 'house', 'size', 'big', 'beautiful', 'pool', 'arcade', 'gymn', 'big', 'room', 'just', 'anything', 'guy', 'could', 'want', 'wouldnt', 'be', 'much', 'sacrifice', 'may', 'have', 'made', 'life', 'own', 'now', 'i', 'really', 'dont', 'see', 'much', 'anything', 'anymore', 'think', 'somewhere', 'record', 'business.celebrity', 'kids', 'do', 'have', 'one', 'major', 'advantage', 'screw', 'up', 'big', 'pick', 'back', 'up', 'get', 'lives', 'straight', 'still', 'land', 'killer', 'jobs', 'not', 'so', 'hollywood', 'world', 'can', 'screw', 'up', 'when', 'young', 'people', 'schools', 'jobs', 'are', 'gon', 'na', 'be', 'busting', 'chops', 'rest', 'career', 'coming', 'teenage', 'screw', 'up', 'grown', 'up', 'straitened', 'up', 'fighting', 'tooth', 'nail', 'trying', 'get', 'medical', 'school', 'i', 'can', 'say', 'doesnt', 'work', 'way', 'everybody']",The Osbournes - The 2 1/2 Season
