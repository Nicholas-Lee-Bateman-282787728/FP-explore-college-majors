If that's not enough for you, there's also a love interest between O'Neal and the wife of big Eddie (Kiel, the giant who played Jaws in several James Bond films)! Though the story is uneven and derivative, it still manages to be a hilarious, slick, superbly cast comedy. O'Neal is charming as usual, Kiel is ferociously funny, and Warden is a total knockout. Not for those seeking originality or real depth. Yet despite that, you'll have a great time.

233916,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,6300269205,David Baldwin,"[11, 12]","Director writer Andrew Bergman proved with his contribution to the ""Blazing Saddles"" script and his masterwork, ""The Freshman"" that he is capable of real comic inspiration.  ""So Fine"" doesn't reach those lofty heights but there are moments of real hilarity here.  The film can best be described as a homage to the screwball comedies of the Thirties and Forties spiked with off-color humor.  If you can say anything it's that Bergman was prescient in foreseeing the see-through jeans fad.  Think low riders and thong underwear.  Ryan O'Neal, a terrific light comedian as proven in ""What's Up Doc"" and ""Paper Moon"", gracefully delegates most of the spotlight to his co-stars.  Jack Warden is a delight as O'Neal's garment peddler father whose desperation in saving his failing business forces him to push his rags in Bloomingdales without their  permission.  Mariangelo Melato is hilarious as the sexpot mobster wife whose passions run so high that she wants to copulate with O'Neal while the mobster's still in the bed.  The biggest surprise is Richard Kiel, better known as Jaws from the Bond films, who gets to poke fun at his image.  Highlights are Kiel sauntering through a campus cafeteria while the Four Seasons ""Walk Like a Man"" streams from the soundtrack and his singing Italian opera in ""Othello"" makeup.  My fave sight gag was Kiel frightening a filling station guard dog that the poor animal's fur went from black to white.  ""So Fine"" falls short of classic but it definitely constitutes as a sleeper.",5,"Pauly Walnuts, Herman Munster, Jaws...How Can You Beat It",1264118400,"01 22, 2010",2010,1512,"['Director', 'writer', 'Andrew', 'Bergman', 'proved', 'contribution', 'Blazing', 'Saddles', 'script', 'masterwork', 'Freshman', 'capable', 'real', 'comic', 'inspiration', 'So', 'Fine', ""n't"", 'reach', 'lofty', 'heights', 'are', 'moments', 'real', 'hilarity', 'here', 'film', 'can', 'best', 'be', 'described', 'homage', 'screwball', 'comedies', 'Thirties', 'Forties', 'spiked', 'off-color', 'humor', 'can', 'say', 'anything', 'Bergman', 'was', 'prescient', 'foreseeing', 'see-through', 'jeans', 'fad', 'Think', 'low', 'riders', 'thong', 'underwear', 'Ryan', ""O'Neal"", 'terrific', 'light', 'comedian', 'proven', 'What', 'Up', 'Doc', 'Paper', 'Moon', 'gracefully', 'most', 'spotlight', 'co-stars', 'Jack', 'Warden', 'delight', ""O'Neal"", 'garment', 'peddler', 'father', 'desperation', 'saving', 'failing', 'business', 'forces', 'push', 'rags', 'Bloomingdales', 'permission', 'Mariangelo', 'Melato', 'hilarious', 'sexpot', 'mobster', 'wife', 'passions', 'run', 'so', 'high', 'copulate', ""O'Neal"", 'mobster', 'still', 'bed', 'biggest', 'surprise', 'Richard', 'Kiel', 'better', 'known', 'Jaws', 'Bond', 'films', 'who', 'poke', 'fun', 'image', 'Highlights', 'are', 'Kiel', 'sauntering', 'campus', 'cafeteria', 'Four', 'Seasons', 'Walk', 'Man', 'streams', 'soundtrack', 'singing', 'Italian', 'opera', 'Othello', 'makeup', 'fave', 'sight', 'gag', 'was', 'Kiel', 'frightening', 'filling', 'station', 'guard', 'dog', 'poor', 'animal', 'fur', 'went', 'black', 'white', 'So', 'Fine', 'short', 'classic', 'definitely', 'sleeper']",N/A

233920,A2KNX6Y72E1FVJ,6300269205,"V. Risoli ""black farmer""","[0, 3]","""So Fine,"" the debut of Andrew Bergman as a director/writer hits a few notes as a comedy, but is overall very uninvolving.  And the 1981 comedy has the stars all look like they are straining physically.  Ryan O'Neal was 40 years old and looked better in nearly everything else he did including more than decade later in Cher's ""Faithful.""  A year later he looked much better in ""Partners"" and pulled off the sex appeal.  Jack Warden consistently looks terrible like he was winded.  Mariangela Melato makes an unappealing female co-star for O'Neal, although she comes out best of the entire cast performance-wise.  Richard Kiel and Fred Gwynne look awful. The camera is unrelentless on making everyone look awful even those in the jeans commercials.  The general idea and a few of the gags are inspired but the movie moves along limply and tends toward being formulaic.  Didn't Howard Stern use the idea of cut out bottomed jeans originally?
