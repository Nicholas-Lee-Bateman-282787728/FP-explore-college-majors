After the title sequence, this movie has no respect for the old television show and never approaches its waggish sense of humor.

1095339,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B000UMLJZ8,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[2, 3]","When I first heard that Disney was going to be putting out a live action version of ""Underdog,"" I cringed at the thought. How could one make a live action film based on a cartoon who's key character was A) a dog, B) interacted freely with humans and other animals and C) was definitely a product of its times? Sure, the ""Scooby-Doo"" films have been out for awhile, but Scooby (and his cousins) were the only animals that interacted with anyone and their update was a fair success. Although Disney's answer wasn't 100% perfect, it was definitely a good response.What the writers did was simplify the original tale somewhat. Instead of having Underdog interact with humans by being a shoeshine boy, he became an out-of-luck former police dog who's picked up by the caring-but-tense family of James Belushi and Alex Neuberger. They name him ""Shoeshine."" They also made the rest of the animals, namely Polly and Riff-Raff, only interact with Underdog and not the humans. Lastly, they firmly planted this film in 2007 by updating the lingo, the music, and the science that created Underdog.Simon Barsinister (Peter Dinklage) and Cad (Patrick Warburton) are along for the ride and just like in the old TV show, they are Underdog's primary adversaries. Jason Lee provides the voice of the super pup, and gives him a refreshing update that I'm sure will tick off fans of the original cartoon.The story, as mentioned earlier, is based around a not-so-hot police dog who's literally laughed off of the force by his comrades. He's picked up by Barsinister and Cad and becomes Underdog through a lab accident. He escapes from Barsinister and is picked up by another has-been cop, James Belushi. He's taken in by Belushi and his son and begins to form a strong bond with the boy. The rest of the story centers around Barsinister trying to capture Underdog to use his powers to take over the city and, eventually, the world. Along the way Shoeshine/Underdog falls for Polly, his new family gets closer, and he struggles with a catchphrase.Sure, the story is simplistic and entirely unbelievable, but this is still a very good film to take your children to. I don't recall any harsh language but there is a little bit of violence and some puppy peril. At one point a particular pup gets into a deadly situation that might scare very young children. Just know that all turns out well in the end and I promise that your kids will be smiling before the movie is over.This isn't a great film, but it is a very good family flick. The cast do an excellent job with what they have to work with and the special effects are of a similar (but slightly better) grade as those in other recent live-action flicks that involve CGI characters. I'm especially fond of Underdog's take-offs when he heads to the air.Fans of the original series will probably cry foul over what has happened to their beloved Underdog. They do have a legitimate gripe but this film wasn't made to recall a ton of memories. It was made to draw in a modern crowd of youngsters and their families (some of which may not have even heard of the original show). The bottomline is this: It's a good family show that is enjoyable for both kids and their parents. Haggle over the changes if you must, but in the end, Disney has a winner with ""Underdog.""",4,Furry Family Fun,1187740800,"08 22, 2007",2007,3292,"['When', 'first', 'heard', 'Disney', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'putting', 'out', 'live', 'action', 'version', 'Underdog', 'cringed', 'thought', 'How', 'could', 'one', 'make', 'live', 'action', 'film', 'based', 'cartoon', 'who', 'key', 'character', 'was', 'A', 'dog', 'B', 'interacted', 'freely', 'humans', 'other', 'animals', 'C', 'was', 'definitely', 'product', 'times', 'Sure', 'Scooby-Doo', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'out', 'awhile', 'Scooby', 'cousins', 'were', 'only', 'animals', 'interacted', 'anyone', 'update', 'was', 'fair', 'success', 'Disney', 'answer', 'was', ""n't"", '100', '%', 'perfect', 'was', 'definitely', 'good', 'response.What', 'writers', 'did', 'was', 'simplify', 'original', 'tale', 'somewhat', 'Instead', 'having', 'Underdog', 'interact', 'humans', 'being', 'shoeshine', 'boy', 'became', 'out-of-luck', 'former', 'police', 'dog', 'who', 'picked', 'up', 'caring-but-tense', 'family', 'James', 'Belushi', 'Alex', 'Neuberger', 'name', 'Shoeshine', 'also', 'made', 'rest', 'animals', 'namely', 'Polly', 'Riff-Raff', 'only', 'interact', 'Underdog', 'not', 'humans', 'Lastly', 'firmly', 'planted', 'film', '2007', 'updating', 'lingo', 'music', 'science', 'created', 'Underdog.Simon', 'Barsinister', 'Peter', 'Dinklage', 'Cad', 'Patrick', 'Warburton', 'are', 'along', 'ride', 'just', 'old', 'TV', 'show', 'are', 'Underdog', 'primary', 'adversaries', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'voice', 'super', 'pup', 'refreshing', 'update', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'tick', 'off', 'fans', 'original', 'cartoon.The', 'story', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'based', 'not-so-hot', 'police', 'dog', 'who', 'literally', 'laughed', 'force', 'comrades', 'picked', 'up', 'Barsinister', 'Cad', 'Underdog', 'lab', 'accident', 'Barsinister', 'picked', 'up', 'has-been', 'cop', 'James', 'Belushi', 'taken', 'Belushi', 'son', 'form', 'strong', 'bond', 'boy', 'rest', 'story', 'centers', 'Barsinister', 'trying', 'capture', 'Underdog', 'use', 'powers', 'take', 'over', 'city', 'eventually', 'world', 'way', 'Shoeshine/Underdog', 'Polly', 'new', 'family', 'closer', 'catchphrase.Sure', 'story', 'simplistic', 'entirely', 'unbelievable', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'take', 'children', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'harsh', 'language', 'little', 'bit', 'violence', 'puppy', 'peril', 'one', 'point', 'particular', 'pup', 'deadly', 'situation', 'might', 'scare', 'very', 'young', 'children', 'Just', 'know', 'out', 'well', 'end', 'promise', 'kids', 'will', 'be', 'smiling', 'movie', 'over.This', ""n't"", 'great', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'family', 'flick', 'cast', 'do', 'excellent', 'job', 'what', 'have', 'work', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'similar', 'slightly', 'better', 'grade', 'other', 'recent', 'live-action', 'flicks', 'involve', 'CGI', 'characters', ""'m"", 'especially', 'fond', 'Underdog', 'take-offs', 'when', 'air.Fans', 'original', 'series', 'will', 'probably', 'cry', 'foul', 'what', 'happened', 'beloved', 'Underdog', 'do', 'have', 'legitimate', 'gripe', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'made', 'recall', 'ton', 'memories', 'was', 'made', 'draw', 'modern', 'crowd', 'youngsters', 'families', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'even', 'heard', 'original', 'show', 'bottomline', 'good', 'family', 'show', 'enjoyable', 'kids', 'parents', 'Haggle', 'changes', 'must', 'end', 'Disney', 'winner', 'Underdog']",Underdog [Theatrical Release]

He was also great comic relief in the Stephen King thrillerDreamcatcher.  I thought he was the perfect voice to continue what Wally Cox had so successfully done years ago on the small screen.  Throw in Patrick Warburton (briefly Will Smith's partner inMen in Black IIand Elaine's boyfriend onSeinfeld) who has done many voice overs, most notably as Kronk in Disney'sThe Emperor's New Grooveand it's sequel, and I thought I would have an entertaining film for my family, but, alas, this film is rarely funny or entertaining.I will not even bother with any kind of summary of the plot as it is all rather silly, cliched, and unfunny.  Very little holds this film together and it was a big disappointment.  I'm all in favor of family films, but they have to rise above this kind of trash.  Except for the general appeal of the major actors in this film, including James Belushi, there isn't anything positive I can say about this film.If you are looking for a family film outing that entertains the whole family, this IS NOT IT!",1,Throw this dog a bone and hope it gets lost!,1186963200,"08 13, 2007",2007,1297,"['Inspired', 'casting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'save', 'lame', 'film', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'being', 'entertaining', 'considering', 'pedigree', 'pun', 'intended', '.I', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'Jason', 'Lee', ""TV'sMy"", 'Name', 'Is', 'Earl', 'who', 'very', 'pleasing', 'sincere', 'narrative', 'voice', 'well', 'hit', 'TV', 'show', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'comic', 'relief', 'Stephen', 'King', 'thrillerDreamcatcher', 'thought', 'was', 'perfect', 'voice', 'continue', 'what', 'Wally', 'Cox', 'had', 'so', 'successfully', 'done', 'years', 'ago', 'small', 'screen', 'Throw', 'Patrick', 'Warburton', 'briefly', 'Will', 'Smith', 'partner', 'inMen', 'Black', 'IIand', 'Elaine', 'boyfriend', 'onSeinfeld', 'who', 'done', 'many', 'voice', 'overs', 'most', 'notably', 'Kronk', ""Disney'sThe"", 'Emperor', 'New', 'Grooveand', 'sequel', 'thought', 'would', 'have', 'entertaining', 'film', 'family', 'alas', 'film', 'rarely', 'funny', 'entertaining.I', 'will', 'not', 'even', 'bother', 'kind', 'summary', 'plot', 'rather', 'silly', 'cliched', 'unfunny', 'Very', 'little', 'film', 'together', 'was', 'big', 'disappointment', ""'m"", 'favor', 'family', 'films', 'have', 'rise', 'kind', 'trash', 'general', 'appeal', 'major', 'actors', 'film', 'including', 'James', 'Belushi', ""n't"", 'anything', 'positive', 'can', 'say', 'film.If', 'are', 'looking', 'family', 'film', 'outing', 'whole', 'family', 'NOT', 'IT']",Underdog [Theatrical Release]

The original Underdog cartoon had already turned the superhero/secret-identity genre on its head, and this live-action movie does the same for that cartoon.Oh, the pieces are all there. We have the evil Simon Bar Sinister, as short in this live action as he was in the cartoon, with his coiffed but cloddish henchman. We have Sweet Polly Purebred. We even have the humble but lovable Shoeshine - somehow, the writers made all that work in translating it to a recognizable world, where Underdog is a regular household pet.A few ""Mad Scientist"" scenes might be a bit much for the littlest, most skittish viewers.
