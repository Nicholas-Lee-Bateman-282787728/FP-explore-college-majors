1272796,AKJONKU5DALMF,B002JVWRAO,"A.Marte ""Supernatural  Lover""","[1, 1]","I knew from the end of season 4 that this season would be awesome. In fact I might dare say it was the best one.The majority of the first three seasons focused on one particular demon and different lore/mythological monsters. I enjoyed watching the writers take on wendingos, jinns, gollums, vampires etc. It was good having stories with a plot within the plot; the main plot being the Winchesters family. Last season ended with Lucifier being set free and the whole time I was on pins and needles. I did not watch this season each week because I did that in season 4 and I almost gave myself a coronary from anticipated excitement, lol.This season starts with boys trying to stop the impending apocalypse. There was some great episodes on this season, far too many to name. Usually I have at least one episode a season that I just cannot get into(ghostfacers) but I loved every one. I want to give extra kudos to the writers for incorporating Odin, my favorite of the Gods in the storyline. That is one of the reason supernatural is so great: it opens up your mind to different culture, provides you with knowledge, and is so freaking entertaining.Once again I loved Micha's Castiel and how he interacted with Dean. The only thing that I truly hated was that both Ellen and Jo had to die. I like seeing ""all business in the front, party in the back"" Ash coming back in, as well as how the writers dealt with the Winchester's half brother. Another great thing about supernatural and its writers is they get a lot of things right, the writers do their homework. I will not give much away but this was a really great season. Although I love supernatural, I really do not want to see it go, but I think they should just stop here. Let Dean have ""some"" happy ending; he deserves it.",5,Shockingly Excellent....NOT!!!

1272802,AG0TA24LI0XV7,B002JVWRAO,"Baron Sardonicus, Super Genius","[2, 2]","I came late to the show, having dismissed it at first glance-- assuming it was simply an all-action Hardy Boys clone for teens. I was dead wrong. I'm glad someone convinced me to give ""Supernatural"" a try. I started watching the DVD's with season one and just kept plugging away over a few months, finishing season five recently. This show is quality. There has not been one episode where I said, ""That was a waste of time"". Everything is top notch here: writing, acting, cinematography, editing, production design, music scoring. Sure, it has its clunky moments now and then (nothing's perfect), and some writers do questionable things, but on the whole it is a good TV experience.If this had been merely a festival of monster-killing I would not have fallen under the spell. Instead, we have something with depth and fun and richness. There are wonderful stand-alone episodes, and there is the ongoing story arc (which began to grow tedious, but that's my own peckadillo), and there are a couple of downright hilarious episodes.The writers never forget what the point is here, the story of a tattered little family. Sam and Dean are outstanding characters who change, grow, fail, cry, bicker, and persevere. Somehow I never tired of their Luke Skywalker/Han Solo personalities. Dean's rock 'n roll attitude and his fondness for pie and cheeseburgers made him so likable. The main appeal of this series is these two brothers, because we grow to care for them and like them.My favorite seasons are the first and second, but each one so far has had its good points. This fifth season gave us several things to like, but the most memorable to me was the change in the character of Castiel, who loses his angelic power and is reduced to hitting the bottle (and trying to figure out how to leave an outgoing voicemail message on his phone). Brilliant stuff, and a good actor in Misha Collins pulling it off. It was fascinating seeing him go from the strong 'film noir' persona to an awkward, lost goofball.And we have yet another delicious season climax, leaving us wondering what lies ahead for the Winchester boys. I look forward to the next chapter.",4,A Consistently Rewarding and Enjoyable Series,1375401600,"08 2, 2013",2013,2148,"['came', 'late', 'show', 'having', 'dismissed', 'first', 'glance', 'assuming', 'was', 'simply', 'all-action', 'Hardy', 'Boys', 'clone', 'teens', 'was', 'dead', 'wrong', ""'m"", 'glad', 'someone', 'convinced', 'give', 'Supernatural', 'try', 'started', 'watching', 'DVD', 'season', 'one', 'just', 'kept', 'plugging', 'away', 'few', 'months', 'finishing', 'season', 'five', 'recently', 'show', 'quality', 'not', 'been', 'one', 'episode', 'where', 'said', 'was', 'waste', 'time', 'Everything', 'top', 'notch', 'here', 'writing', 'acting', 'cinematography', 'editing', 'production', 'design', 'music', 'scoring', 'Sure', 'clunky', 'moments', 'now', 'then', 'nothing', 'perfect', 'writers', 'do', 'questionable', 'things', 'whole', 'good', 'TV', 'experience.If', 'had', 'been', 'merely', 'festival', 'monster-killing', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'fallen', 'spell', 'Instead', 'have', 'something', 'depth', 'fun', 'richness', 'are', 'wonderful', 'stand-alone', 'episodes', 'ongoing', 'story', 'arc', 'began', 'grow', 'tedious', 'own', 'peckadillo', 'are', 'couple', 'downright', 'hilarious', 'episodes.The', 'writers', 'never', 'forget', 'what', 'point', 'here', 'story', 'tattered', 'little', 'family', 'Sam', 'Dean', 'are', 'outstanding', 'characters', 'who', 'change', 'grow', 'fail', 'cry', 'bicker', 'persevere', 'Somehow', 'never', 'tired', 'Luke', 'Skywalker/Han', 'Solo', 'personalities', 'Dean', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'attitude', 'fondness', 'pie', 'cheeseburgers', 'made', 'so', 'likable', 'main', 'appeal', 'series', 'two', 'brothers', 'grow', 'care', 'them.My', 'favorite', 'seasons', 'are', 'first', 'second', 'one', 'so', 'far', 'had', 'good', 'points', 'fifth', 'season', 'gave', 'several', 'things', 'like', 'most', 'memorable', 'was', 'change', 'character', 'Castiel', 'who', 'angelic', 'power', 'reduced', 'hitting', 'bottle', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'leave', 'outgoing', 'voicemail', 'message', 'phone', 'Brilliant', 'stuff', 'good', 'actor', 'Misha', 'Collins', 'pulling', 'off', 'was', 'fascinating', 'seeing', 'go', 'strong', 'noir', 'persona', 'awkward', 'lost', 'goofball.And', 'have', 'yet', 'delicious', 'season', 'climax', 'leaving', 'wondering', 'what', 'ahead', 'Winchester', 'boys', 'look', 'forward', 'next', 'chapter']",N/A
1272803,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B002JVWRAO,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[16, 20]","The CW series ""Supernatural"" just keeps going and growing and growing. Season 5 was originally planned to be the final season for the series, but things, thankfully, changed. I have been a fan of this show from the very first episode. The series has continued to develop and deepen with each passing season. I certainly have my favorites, but there is no denying the richness and depth that each new year contains. That being said, season 5 would come in fifth place for me if I was to rank my favorite seasons. But first things first....At the end of the wonderful season 4(which many believe to be the show's best season), the devil, Lucifer, was set free. The season 5 season premiere, ""Lucifer Rising"", picks up where we left off. Sam and Dean(Jared Padalecki, Jensen Ackles) prepare for the devil, learn shocking news about Castiel(Misha Collins), and Lucifer finds himself a host body. From here on out, the 22 episode season has the boys trying to find a way to stop Lucifer from bringing about the apocalypse. Those apocalypses are always pains! Like seasons past, there are fun, more stand alone episodes. ""Fallen Idols"" have certain objects of the past(like the car James Dean was killed in)killing people of the present. It's a fun idea, and it features a brief cameo by Paris Hilton. Yes, I said Paris Hilton. It's not as bad as you think. If you loathe Ms.Hilton, you should still be happy. Elsewhere, there is the absolutely hysterical ""Changing Channels"". Sam and Dean find themselves trapped in different kinds of TV shows - sitcom, hospital drama, CSI-type show, etc. It's a fun episode playing on the cliches of these shows, and gets a chance to take some digs on the overwhelming abundance of procedural and medical shows. It put a huge smile on my face. ""The Real Ghostbusters"" was a lot of fun as well. The boys go to a Supernatural convention, where people are dressed up like them, when they encounter a very real haunting. Another hysterical episode. After that, it's not a lot of fun and games. We are in Lucifer/Apocalypse territory, and it is the core focus of the season, even though you don't see a whole lot of Lucifer. ""Abandon All Hope"" is a massive episode that features a shocking demise; ""My Bloody Valentine"" is a pretty cool episode about a murderous Cupid; ""The Song Remains The Same"" is a sequel to season 4's ""In The Beginning"", when the boys travel back to the 70s to see their young parents. The finale, ""Swan Song"", is a little subdued and understated given we are dealing with the apocalypse. Still, the last several minutes had me on the edge of my seat contemplating the future of several characters.Even though there is a lot of good in season 5, it is my least favorite. The whole storyline didn't seem to be as big as it should of been(probably thanks to budgetary reasons), and the second half of the season focused heavily on it and a number of the episodes all kind of ran together. This was the first season of the show where it was hard for me to differentiate some episodes. That being said, Ackles and Padalecki continue to do great work, and the direction of the show remains top notch. There was just a 'spark' that was missing from this season, that was apparent in all past seasons. A certain sense of fun just wasn't quite there. Maybe it was deliberate, given the dour situation of season 5's story arc, but it was a little hard going and boring in many places.In the end, season 5 of ""Supernatural"", given it's shortcomings to me, still remained good TV, and will most definitley find it's way on my shelf next to the last 4 seasons, despite it not being quite as satisfying. However, the very end of the season finale sets up some very interesting questions for season 6. From what I have heard, season 6 will be a return to form. I am excited.",3,The Devil Comes To Town,1283558400,"09 4, 2010",2010,3808,"['CW', 'series', 'Supernatural', 'just', 'going', 'growing', 'growing', 'Season', '5', 'was', 'originally', 'planned', 'be', 'final', 'season', 'series', 'things', 'thankfully', 'changed', 'have', 'been', 'fan', 'show', 'very', 'first', 'episode', 'series', 'continued', 'develop', 'deepen', 'passing', 'season', 'certainly', 'have', 'favorites', 'denying', 'richness', 'depth', 'new', 'year', 'contains', 'being', 'said', 'season', '5', 'would', 'come', 'fifth', 'place', 'was', 'rank', 'favorite', 'seasons', 'first', 'things', 'first', 'end', 'wonderful', 'season', '4', 'many', 'believe', 'be', 'show', 'best', 'season', 'devil', 'Lucifer', 'was', 'set', 'free', 'season', '5', 'season', 'premiere', 'Lucifer', 'Rising', 'up', 'where', 'left', 'off', 'Sam', 'Dean', 'Jared', 'Padalecki', 'Jensen', 'Ackles', 'prepare', 'devil', 'learn', 'shocking', 'news', 'Castiel', 'Misha', 'Collins', 'Lucifer', 'host', 'body', 'here', 'out', '22', 'episode', 'season', 'boys', 'trying', 'find', 'way', 'stop', 'Lucifer', 'bringing', 'apocalypse', 'apocalypses', 'are', 'always', 'pains', 'seasons', 'past', 'are', 'fun', 'more', 'stand', 'alone', 'episodes', 'Fallen', 'Idols', 'have', 'certain', 'objects', 'past', 'car', 'James', 'Dean', 'was', 'killed', 'killing', 'people', 'present', 'fun', 'idea', 'brief', 'cameo', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'Yes', 'said', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'think', 'loathe', 'Ms.Hilton', 'should', 'still', 'be', 'happy', 'Elsewhere', 'absolutely', 'hysterical', 'Changing', 'Channels', 'Sam', 'Dean', 'find', 'trapped', 'different', 'kinds', 'TV', 'shows', 'sitcom', 'hospital', 'drama', 'CSI-type', 'show', 'etc', 'fun', 'episode', 'playing', 'cliches', 'shows', 'chance', 'take', 'digs', 'overwhelming', 'abundance', 'procedural', 'medical', 'shows', 'put', 'huge', 'smile', 'face', 'Real', 'Ghostbusters', 'was', 'lot', 'fun', 'well', 'boys', 'go', 'Supernatural', 'convention', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'dressed', 'up', 'when', 'encounter', 'very', 'real', 'haunting', 'hysterical', 'episode', 'not', 'lot', 'fun', 'games', 'are', 'Lucifer/Apocalypse', 'territory', 'core', 'focus', 'season', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'whole', 'lot', 'Lucifer', 'Abandon', 'Hope', 'massive', 'episode', 'shocking', 'demise', 'Bloody', 'Valentine', 'pretty', 'cool', 'episode', 'murderous', 'Cupid', 'Song', 'Same', 'sequel', 'season', '4', 'Beginning', 'when', 'boys', 'travel', 'back', '70s', 'see', 'young', 'parents', 'finale', 'Swan', 'Song', 'little', 'subdued', 'understated', 'given', 'are', 'dealing', 'apocalypse', 'Still', 'last', 'several', 'minutes', 'had', 'edge', 'seat', 'contemplating', 'future', 'several', 'characters.Even', 'lot', 'good', 'season', '5', 'least', 'favorite', 'whole', 'storyline', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'as', 'big', 'should', 'been', 'probably', 'thanks', 'budgetary', 'reasons', 'second', 'half', 'season', 'focused', 'heavily', 'number', 'episodes', 'kind', 'ran', 'together', 'was', 'first', 'season', 'show', 'where', 'was', 'hard', 'differentiate', 'episodes', 'being', 'said', 'Ackles', 'Padalecki', 'continue', 'do', 'great', 'work', 'direction', 'show', 'top', 'notch', 'was', 'just', ""'spark"", 'was', 'missing', 'season', 'was', 'apparent', 'past', 'seasons', 'certain', 'sense', 'fun', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'there', 'Maybe', 'was', 'deliberate', 'given', 'dour', 'situation', 'season', '5', 'story', 'arc', 'was', 'little', 'hard', 'going', 'boring', 'many', 'places.In', 'end', 'season', '5', 'Supernatural', 'given', 'shortcomings', 'still', 'remained', 'good', 'TV', 'will', 'most', 'definitley', 'find', 'way', 'shelf', 'last', '4', 'seasons', 'not', 'being', 'quite', 'satisfying', 'However', 'very', 'end', 'season', 'finale', 'up', 'very', 'interesting', 'questions', 'season', '6', 'what', 'have', 'heard', 'season', '6', 'will', 'be', 'return', 'form', 'am', 'excited']",N/A

The writers didn't just piece together plots out of nowhere when they had nothing better to do. The characters are all well developed and driven by the content over the years. Nothing is lost, everything, even characters that you have seen before are interwoven brilliantly from the beginning of the series up through the present, the sign of excellent writing! The best part about the production of this show is no film is wasted. You know how you watch 2nd rate shows or movies and there's absolutely no reason to have shown a scene, or they cut in the same useless scene later as if they don't have enough screenplay to make a typically-timed movie/show; that doesn't happen here! When there is a focus on a face the emotions are expertly carried by the characters from Sam & Dean to Jim & Cass. Even when they throw in a comical highlight or two it fits the characters perfectly. Now the music, hey I did my sentence of high school with most of the songs they use, which impresses me just as much as the lovely creaks, moans and groans of Dean's ""Baby"".

The entire season was building up to a climactic battle between the archangel Michael and his banished little brother who happens to be Lucifer the lord of all thats evil in the world; but when it came time for the big showdown, what should have been a battle of cosmic proportions complete with fire, brimstone, and hell on earth destruction is substituted with a mild argument between two brothers who will never see eye to eye on things! I guess thats all what the showrunners could come up with given only a TV budget to work with.

I have to admit I liked the monster of the week formula during the first couple of seasons. In addition, I thought seasons three and four, while entertaining, were getting a bit heavy handed and awfully somber. I missed the humor, and I was getting tired of the angels vs demons serial-style episodes, and felt like it was time for the show to move on, wrap up that story line.Well, season 5 finds the perfect balance. We are treated to several very entertaining monster of the week episodes, which we hadn't seen in a couple of years - in that sense the show sort of gets back to the basics - but the writers also do a fantastic job of moving the angels vs demons story along in some very entertaining and unexpected directions. The latter finally reaches a fever pitch as related plot and character revelations come fast and furious, and the saga reaches its climax. Season 5 also brings back some long lost characters from earlier seasons, and the acting is the best of any of the 5 seasons. Misha Collins, who has always been excellent as the angel Cas, is absolutely suburb, bringing not only a fresh dramatic dimension to the character, but, combined with good writing, a wonderful new humor as well; there are laugh out loud moments, due in part to the dialogue, but also Collins' delivery.

I thought this was a really good season, and they provided a mostly satisfying ending to the original 5-year storyline. There were some parts I thought could have been better, but the good parts far outnumber the not-so-good. I'll hit the good parts first. --WARNING-- spoilers from here on in the rest of this review! If you haven't seen it, then you should probably stop reading... NOW.The good: Lucifer was very menacing, even when he was trying to act nice and play a poor victim. Seeing Ash again, in Heaven, was awesome. Ellen and Jo's death was very well done. I like the addition of Crowley, as well as the antagonism between Dean and Zachariah. I think they did a great job with some episodes that could have been really stupid and cheesy, but they pulled it off. For example, the future episode was good, and the ""Supernatural convention"" episode was even better. I loved the tv series episode, where Sam was forced to do a genital herpes commercial, and Dean avoided getting nailed in the crotch on a Japanese game show. I really felt it when Dean lost all hope after their trip to Heaven, and he and Sam were basically told to buzz off by God himself. I liked all of the Horsemen, especially Death; his one scene in the Chicago pizza joint was epic! Did you notice in that scene, even Dean, Mr. smart mouth, is wise enough.. or terrified enough? ...not to give Death the smart alec routine. I liked the twist of the trickster turning out to be an archangel, and the brother of Lucifer. The plots had their usual excellent twists and surprises that I have come to expect from this show. It's pretty useless trying to out-guess the writers on this show, just enjoy the ride.The bad: I don't think we saw Lucifer enough, especially early in the season. I don't like seeing Sam and Dean at each other's throats all the time; I hope in the 6th season they patch things up again. I respect the decision to put Bobby in a wheel chair; it drove home the point that hunting is dangerous and has consequences, but I still think it felt a little forced. I do disagree with the move to make Castiel a weakened shadow of his former self. They managed to get some decent ""angel discovering humanity"" laughs out of it, but there was no real reason for Castiel to be impotent and nearly useless. What happened to the anti-Christ kid? He had one episode and then he was just gone. Speaking of Christ, where was Jesus in all of this? They tapped just about everyone else in the bible, but no Jesus? Also, I can't help but feel that the ending was watered down a little from what it would have been if there had been no 6th season. Would they really have ended the series with Sam trapped in Hell, sharing a cage with Lucifer and Michael, while Dean was suicidally depressed on Earth? I don't think so.So for season 6, I have a lot of hopes and expectations. I hope that the brothers will become a team again, and stop whining about their angst to each other. I want to see more of the creative unpredictability that we have gotten used to. I hope to see Sam and Dean learn to balance a somewhat normal life along with hunting, so that they can enjoy life while hunting. Other hunters do it, so why not Sam and Dean?

The whole of the story arc explodes and rushes through what is going to be the end of the line, at least in terms of the five seasons of meta-plot. The plot is wrapped up nice and tight. Anyone that has watched the show knows this was to be the final season. But I'm going to keep this without spoilers.We know what to expect - we're given the industry standard: 5.1 Dolby Digital, and the DVD's visual gives the season a pretty good edgy and grainy look. When I finally buckle and buy them on BD, I am sure the quality will likely overshadow this DVD set and end the grainy effect. The acting, digital F/X, and the soundtrack are all so much better than what came before. The special features... wow. We get a little commentary (seriously, one commentary track on the The End episode 4), the Ghostfacers web-series (almost like watching a train wreck and it suddenly turns to flowers and rainbows; these guys need their own show), a deleted scene from episode 9, then magic: a walk through the Supernatural Apocalypse survival guide. I would have bought the DVD just for this. Anything that focuses on the guest stars is always a treat.So sit back, relax with some popcorn and your fellow horror fans, and hang on tight - this is the end game.

It honestly should have ended with Swan Song and that certain scene. SN fans will know what I am talking about. It would have been a perfect ending to a perfect series. I still watch the new episodes, but I don't really consider them to be anything but schlock compared to Season 5. THIS is what a TV show should be. Angels, demons, Lucifer, and even, dare I spoil it, GOD. This season was superb and nothing I've seen since can compare. My favorite episodes were Changing Channels (it was funny, but also very serious in the end) and Swan Song (God is at last revealed, and the Winchesters' story honestly comes to an end). S6/7/8 seem to mostly rely on humor and snark, a la Crowley/Balthasar. I also REALLY hated the corruption of Castiel in the other seasons.If you watch or buy ANY Supernatural season, make it this one. It is best if you know the story, but you can watch and love this without even knowing what is going on. I convinced my boyfriend to watch this season and he knew nothing about SN.

1272832,A3HPZ6BIMNXSZR,B002JVWRAO,"Gabriela Perez ""Oy! So many books. . . .""","[6, 6]","I like this show a lot, generally speaking. I deliberately avoided it when it first came out because it just seemed so. . .well, teenybopper-ish. I'd roll my eyes and say to myself that the subject matter and the actors belonged on some station that marketed only to teens and young adults, and in a sense, this show did begin that way. Much of its fan base is still in those age groups, and the number of online discussions about how hot the two main actors are can mislead you into thinking this is a throwaway show wherein two hunks basically kill time from episode to episode. Not so. This is a rare situation--one where a show that may have begun with one target audience has blossomed into a show that draws all sorts of viewers who are impressed by its overall excellence.This is the show's fifth season, and each year has seen the acting get even better, the plotlines come together with incredible consistency and intrigue, and I have to say that I look forward to each week's new episode because I know I will find myself impressed by the way the characters continue to be developed, the story fleshed out. The next week's episode is always something I'm plotzing to see.In this episode, Dean (Jensen Ackles) and Sam (Jared Padalecki) are killed by hunters who want to get rid of the guy (Sam) who got the Apocalypse rolling. Both Dean and Sam end up in heaven (an outcome that takes both brothers by surprise), and what Heaven is, according to the show, is a place where we get to relive our best memories. That sounds simple enough, yes?Heh. Here's one of the reasons I like this show so much. That simple reason leads to some complex and touching scenes and character development.Sam and Dean have had, from the start, an odd family relationship.  Sam never got to know his mother, who died before the timeline of the show started, and Dean became Sam's surrogate father, became the one who took care of him whenever their father took off to hunt demons and otherwise follow his own path to finding the demon who killed his wife, his kids' mom. When the first season begins, Sam is in college, having walked away (in a rough, ""I don't need you in my life"" kind of way) from his father and brother to start a life not defined by the hunt for malevolent supernatural beings.  In that first episode, Sam joins Dean once more in the hunt, and from that point to now, the brothers have rarely been separated for any major length of time. They travel the nation together in a wonderful '67 Impala, and they pretty much are each other's support system, their own family unit of two. Even when  their father shows up again in season one, it's clear that Dean and Sam have a closeness that far surpasses anything their own father has built with them. In fact, it far surpasses any intimacy they develop with anyone else. Most of the tension in this show comes from conflict between the two of them, from the differences in their personalities and their approaches to life.The heart of this show is their relationship, but that relationship's foundation is in need of major attention and perhaps a lot of rebuilding. It might even be wise to start over and build a new one.I won't tell you about the God-related aspects of this episode except to say that Dean is disappointed in the outcome of his search for God's help. The way in which that plays out--well, you'll have to see it for yourself. I don't want to spoil that aspect of things for you. I hope that the info to follow in this review doesn't spoil anything for you, either.In this particular episode, we find out what each main character values most. For Dean, the most important memories have to do with his little brother, with his mother (whom he comforts and supports just as he has done for his brother), with the family that is meaningful to him.  All along, he has put one family member or another in top priority place, above even himself and his own well-being, and his memories reflect that. He is the one who provides emotional support to the people he loves, even when he was a child and should have been able to count on them for that support. Dean has never truly been a child; he's been the parent to most of his family, even his father, whom he admired and tried to emulate, something that I still find touching and sad when it crops up in a scene or episode.  Everything that means anything to Dean is contained in a tight little circle of people he loves. For them, he would willingly sacrifice himself (in fact, he has done so already in the course of the show), and for them, he would continue to wake up each morning ready to fight again in spite of his own deep depression and uncertainty. He is, emotionally speaking, in a terrible place when this episode opens, drinking heavily and hoping desperately that God will help him find a way to make the right decision, to help him prevent the horrible bloodshed he sees coming hard and fast towards him and the rest of humanity. (To make matters even harder for him, he not only has the weight of his family on his shoulders; he bears responsibility for saving the entirety of humanity, and in true Dean fashion, he accepts that weight and does his best to bear it even as it threatens to bore him into the ground and bury him alive.)What we find in this episode is that Dean's great memories and Sam's don't match. Sam's  best memories are all about separation from his father and from Dean, although to be fair, it was mostly his father he tried to get away from. He has never looked at his actions as separating him emotionally from Dean.  When Dean sees which memories are special to Sam, he begins to see in a clearer way how disparate their viewpoints about family really are, and it wounds him to his core. His father is already gone, dead because of a deal he made to save Dean's life, and his brother has grown increasingly distant from him, at a time when Dean needs him most and needs to know in his heart that he can count on him. All the times that Dean protected Sam, tried to be a father to him, provided the things that his actual father wouldn't provide because he was off hunting--those all seem to have meant little to Sam. (I think they in fact meant a lot to Sam, but he hasn't put in proper perspective what Dean has sacrificed until now. In this episode, he discovers just how much Dean had to handle in order to keep his family as balanced and safe as possible, and it looks like the first time that Sam realized just how many messes Dean actually had to ""clean up."")What's impressive about all this, at least to me, is how the show has built to this moment. From the start, the characters' emotions and motivations have been consistent, and all the dialogue and plot action has helped to further develop them, to round them out and make them ""whole."" From season one to now, the ""road"" has led in a consistent and meaningful way to this episode: Dean is very  nearly at a point where life is no longer worth much to him, where all that once was meaningful now seems to have been part of some illusion he created in his mind and heart. Sam's character, too, has progressed in a logical and consistent way to this point. I love that about this show; one of my pet peeves is when characters suddenly become someone else entirely, when a show loses sight of the person it put out there at the start. ""Supernatural"" hasn't done that in five seasons, and I really enjoy that. In season one, in an episode late in the season where Sam is angry that Dean did not let him risk his life to kill the demon who killed their mother, the two brothers fight, and the pain is so clear on Dean's face as he tells Sam that he (Sam) and their father are all he has, that Dean basically can't go on without them.The plot line also has progressed in a logical and consistent way. Whoever's doing continuity in that sense has done a superlative job. I've rarely felt as though an episode took me outside the world the show had established, and that, too, is unusual for a TV show.The acting has always been superb, and it continues to be so. This episode builds on the excellent foundation that Ackles and Padalecki have established over the course of five seasons; both young men approach their roles with what seems to be complete concentration. They have good chemistry on-screen and off, and it's clear from blooper reels and special features on DVD sets that they can have fun as themselves but them become complete professionals on set. I hope that at some point Mr. Ackles will receive the recognition he deserves for crafting as fine a character as can be crafted on a TV show.",5,So much excellence here. . . .,1270425600,"04 5,

They've gone against all manner of urban legends, vampires, werewolves, a scarecrow god, etc. but this season the two brothers and one fallen angel, Castiel played by Misha Collins face all the might of Satan and his army. Kind of a step up from their previous work.Things get even more dangerous when new foes show up like the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse and angels and demons both keep targeting the brothers warning that there is a dangerous fate they both will have to face in the upcoming devastation. With all this going on, they may have to seek a pretty big ally: God.I got to review Season 1 on Blu-ray earlier this year and it was the first time I ever saw the series. I really enjoyed it and now I'm hooked for more. The first season went after so many old school scary stories that I remember from my childhood (Bloody Mary, anyone?) and season 2 quickly brought the death of the eldest Winchester, Sam and Dean's father. Throughout the season, very ominous vague indications were given about Sam's future as a pawn of the demon that killed their father and their mother. Dean was charged with his brother's protection at all costs, even if that meant killing him to prevent him from turning into a tool of the yellow-eyed demon.Now fast-forward a few more seasons and Sam and Dean are battling the apocalypse! It reminds me of when ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" started out slow, then gained momentum until they too had to fight actual Gods and began to run out of big enough baddies to be a good end-season boss to face. The same thing might be happening here but hopefully they'll pull it off well. Interestingly, all the episodes appear to be named after songs or movies with a word or two difference.Bonus Features:For extras, you get ""Supernatural: Apocalypse Survival Guides"" - Bobby's exclusive video collection which is great preparation for the coming end of day's, I'm sure ;-). Then there is Ghostfacers: The Web Series which debuted in April this year following the fearless and often ridiculous ""professional"" ghost hunters in a documentary style format. Their first case was about a starlet who was murdered in front of her dressing room mirror and stars A.J. Buckley as leader Ed, Travis Wester as tactical specialist Harry, Brittany Ishibashi as tech girl Maggie, and Austin Basis as videographer Kenny.There is producer and writer commentary on Episode 4, ""The End"" which is surprising since it doesn't include the main actors and it's so early on in the season. Also there is one unaired scene from Episode 9, ""The Real Ghostbusters."" Really? ONE deleted scene? Also as always, there is a gag reel. For me this feels like pretty slim extras on this set.

1272840,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B002JVWRAO,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 1]","Each season ends on a super dramatic event. The fourth one ended with the releasing of Lucifer from his cage by Sam himself who killed the last seal Lilith. Nothing is said here about the tremendous dedication of demons to their master Lucifer but we should have some kind of a soft and sweet thought in their direction because they serve and the only prize they can get from it is to die, killed in a way or another and for Lilith it was her absolute glory to die at the hands of Sam who is Lucifer's vessel. But would she have accepted to pay that price if they knew what was to really happen?Lucifer being free he uses a first female vessel but fast shifts for a male one, but it is not the real vessel he needs and it decays fast. He has to bring Sam to accepting to be his vessel. But it is not that easy and it will take the whole season to find a way.Let's say clearly the Apocalypse means the four Horsemen and these have to be cast upon humanity if Lucifer is to triumph. On the other hand Sam has to accept to be Lucifer's vessel and Dean has to accept to be Michael's vessel. Things are made slightly more complex when they discover they have a half brother Adam somewhere in the US from one of their father's mission that made him know a woman he visited, her and their son, every year for his birthday and took the boy every year to a baseball game. But the meeting is made difficult because the first Adam and the first mother of his they meet are ghouls who have eaten the real ones up. Sam and Dean will have to kill them both. They will also discover the remains of the bodies and bury them. Adam will have to be resuscitated by Michael to pressurize Dean with the help of the angel Zachariah.The final meeting brings the three boys and Zachariah together when Dean says yes but with some conditions, one being his killing Zachariah on the spot. Dean and Sam manage to escape the cubicle where the meeting was planned but Michael is on his way and he takes Adam instead of Dean. That's where the series is most interesting. Everything has been decided by God and everything is written up there in the big book and yet systematically these two boys do just what they want, particularly Dean. ""Screw destiny right in its face! I say we take the fight to them and we'll do it our way!"" That's the general spirit of Dean: he refuses anything that is imposed to him in a way or another which cpould be considered as typically American.So he faces the Apocalypse the way it comes The four horsemen are supposed to come down first and they take the four of them one after the other. The story here is doubled by the fact that these horsemen all have a ring and the four rings are the key and lock to Lucifer's cage out of which Sam has enabled him to get. The objective then is double: to stop the four horsemen and prevent their misdeeds, and then to capture their four rings.The red Horseman is War and he enjoys getting into a community and making one half believe the other side are demons and vice versa and watch them killing one another to the end. He will lose his fingers and his ring and be defeated. Some well seasoned hunters were taken in by the horseman's antics very easily like Ellen and Jo.The white horseman is Famine and it kills people by making them overeat all the time, even eating one another. He reduces them to their most intimate desire (either their need for sex, food, drinks etc...). Strangely enough he does not live on that satisfaction but he has demons at his service that collect the souls of some dying people and he Famine nourishes himself on these souls carried to him in a special briefcase by a soul collecting demon. Sam and Dean put Famine on a diet by stealing one of these briefcases. But the confrontation is great because, when Famine gives the order to his minions to bring Dean and Sam for him to eat their souls, Sam is able to kill and exorcise all the demons around Famine, except Famine of course. Then Famine eats the black smokes of these demons and Sam exorcises these demons' essences out of Famine, killing him at the same time, since Sam's need was demon blood and he can satisfy himself with the essence of these demons (their black smoke). As for Dean, it is said that he never recovered from his time in Hell and has no desire, like a dead man walking.The green horseman is Pestilence. He spreads all kinds of diseases just by touching people, or even wanting them sick. He is living as Doctor Green in an old people's home where he can experiment his talents. He is also working with a certain Brady in Chicago who is preparing the general attack for Death, the fourth and black horseman, by producing and shipping millions of doses of a special vaccine that will spread the Croatoan virus in the population under the disguise of anti-flu vaccination. Pestilence loves the procedure that will make millions sick and death loves it too since it will make them dead eventually.Sam has to manage his anger when he discovers Brady, one of his old high school and college friends, the very one who introduced him to Jessica, is the direct helper of Pestilence. He will eventually kill him. They will be led to where Death is by Crowley, that demon who managed to get the special Colt from Bela, though the Colt has lost all its magic. Dean will have to confront Death and negotiate his ring with him. Death is bored of being Lucifer's slave and he wants to recapture his freedom, so he gives his ring to Dean provided Dean promises he won't prevent Sam from getting Lucifer back into the cage, a double procedure that requires Sam to accept to be Lucifer's vessel, but then to keep enough power to open the cage and jump into it, Dean having to close the cage in his turn afterwards.But all that is not that simple because Michael has chosen Adam as his vessel and the final fight between Lucifer and Michael takes place in an old cemetery in Lawrence, Kansas between Sam and Adam. Dean will disturb the game by bringing the Impala into the picture with old Rock music that makes Sam nostalgic and when Sam/Lucifer is getting ready to kill Dean with a last final blow Sam takes over with his memories and he opens the cage and ... But then Adam/Michael protests because he did not play his part. Never trust an older son (Michael) especially when he is in fact younger and only a half-brother. And there Sam in a last minute of domination before the end takes Adam/Michael down along with himself and Lucifer into the cage.That's the mystery of this series. It refers in a great eruption of details to some well-known stories, like Saint John's Apocalypse, all kinds of apocrypha around this Apocalypse and many other Apocalypses, since apocalypse only means revelation and there are at least three fundamental ""apocalypses"" in the Bible, two in the Old Testament and Saint John's. Apocrypha are myriads and no one can know them all, especially since some are still somewhere in some desert in a jar under some stone in a cave. We just don't know which cave. At the same time the brothers state as often as they can that we are free to choose what we want and they pervert the stories they are dealing with. Here it is typical: Michael in Lucifer's cage with Lucifer, older and younger brothers, respectively in the bodies and beings of Adam and Sam, half brothers the first one being the younger one, is a perfect perversion and it will lead to a mountain of complications, in the sixth season of course.But the whole series is so rich that we cannot start telling you every single episode. Let me say that the story is more and more closely knit, very few, if even only one, episodes are off the main line. The trickster was such a side line and yet he is brought back into the center in this season, and what a center indeed. An archangel himself. At the same time there is a slightly irritating over-Christianizing of the story and that is maybe the result of the direct connection with Saint John's Book of Revelation.It is gross and absolutely funny to have a convention of all traditional pagan gods, well not all of them as a matter of fact, but a few nevertheless, and it leads to a pleasurable though perfectly sickening episode. It is surprising that these pagan gods are all killed, except Kali, the only woman in the band. Note the approach is really folkloric because most pagan gods that are still worshipped are not males but are most of them androgynous, like the Hindu gods. Kali is supposed to represent that family but the family has three major gods and all of them are androgynous. This episode is pure horrifying comedy. Especially with the victuals in the freezer being live human beings, one or two being actually served at the dinner table. Appetizing indeed. And yet it is in this episode that the Trickster reveals who he really is and is eliminated from the competition by Lucifer himself.It is also a change of direction for Castiel, who, in this fight between Heaven and Hell, chooses to be on mankind's side, a decision that he will pay by becoming more and more human, losing his grace little by little during the whole season. In an episode, when Dean is transferred by the Angels into the future to see what the Apocalypse will bring to Earth, he is the last remaining Angel on Earth, but a poor one, lost in drugs and women: he had become a real human. However, after being killed by Lucifer in the last episode, he is resurrected by God and given back his grace. During a part of the season, he tries to find God to prevent the Apocalypse from happening and his Father tells him to stop looking for him and that he will not intervene as human matters are no longer his concern.In spite of being closely knit the season is also providing quite a few sidetracks but they are systematically brought back in line in a way or another. The First Annual Supernatural Convention though is both funny and silly. Yet it revives and builds up the Chuck character as the author of the comic books, but we know he is also the prophet of God and writing the next Gospel of the faith. And it is this Chuck who closes the series with his concluding remark: ""Endings are bad. But nothing really ends, does it?"" That's what they call suspense I guess. See you next September. Yet this Chuck in-between the various events of the last episode provides us with the history of the famous Impala car that is roaming the roads of TV land searching our mental territories for grotesque demons and all the more grotesque angels.This season is essential though as for the two brothers. Their relation becomes adult enough that they can envisage to be living separate lives and destinies. Dean will survive the events and will have a normal life with Lisa and her/his son Ben. Sam during that time will have a double incestuous relation with his double brother Adam/Michael, being double himself Sam/Lucifer. If Freud is right a relation between two people is in fact a relation between four people, then here a relation between four people is a relation between eight. That means it is very complex, complicated, intricate and fascinating, as for all the combinations you can imagine.Yet all along the two brothers reveal some very interesting things to us.The fact that Dean constantly wants to drop out because he does not have any faith in the whole business, makes him consider he is used more than deciding what he is doing. This develops in him a strange boredom and tiredness that leads to being defeated and walking away. He does it several times and his come-backs become more and more difficult. He is the one who never says a real yes to anyone and the final moment when he says yes to Michael, in his absence what's more, he manages to kill his messenger and escape him, leaving behind a perfectly frightened half portion of what it would take to just imagine being Michael.  And yet, Dean seems to be the only one who makes the choice from his own free will and not to answer a guilty feeling, an angel demand or anything else.Dean suffers from another disease concerning his brother. He treats him like a little brother all the time. True enough Sam treats him like a big brother all the time. They both have to grow up out of boyhood and into adulthood. The first one to do it is Sam, the younger one, because he was baited into demon blood addiction and because he was the one who opened the cage. This tremendous responsibility on the guilty side of his conscience builds in him a new responsibility on the victorious side of his mind: to be the one who can fix his own mistake without the help of big brother even if that means somewhere getting close to killing that big brother and stopping just in time and then disappearing in the limbos of nowhere under an immensity of nowhereness. Though Sam volunteers for that jump into unknown territories, he wants to have the approval of his big brother and his personal and direct decision to get onboard that crazy Luciferian boat leads him to leaving his bigger brother behind, alive luckily.Dean is not that positive. He is more afraid of losing Sam than of losing. He yields to Sam's decision to play the game of Lucifer to trap him, though he may run the risk of killing his own brother in the meantime, a risk that Sam is ready to take because there is a perfectly unfair chance that he may not kill him and stop just before that point. But Dean is ready till and as far as the last minute to die at the hands of his own brother trying to get him back from his Satanic fate. This desire, and I mean desire, to die like that is not a risk he is taking. It is a decision of his because at this moment he wants to die united in his own death to the very fists of his brother killing him. That intensity goes beyond love. Dean at this moment is totally addicted to his relation to his own brother Sam, and only to that relation. He can then step down and move back to Lisa and have a life of oblivion and frustration under the sole light that Sam loved him enough not to kill him. And that peaceful fate for Dean was the strong suggestion Sam made before closing the deal.Dean on the other side is able to widen and open his love to the whole humanity. He is not hunting to kill demons, but to save people. Killing demons is only the easiest method you have to save people. He kills without any pangs of conscience the demons who are endangering humanity, like those at the pharmaceutical plant before the deadly vaccines are shipped out, and yet he will consider his task as done only when he will have saved, one by one, all the humans who got trapped in that factory. Altruism is the fodder of a man like Sam, whereas one-pointed purposefulness is the only food Dean can have and he often has some kind of gastric reflux that gives him indigestion and prevents him from eating his mental stomach full.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU with the help of Ivan EVE",5,Superb and lovable Kali,1323734400,"12 13, 2011",2011,14895,"['season', 'super', 'dramatic', 'event', 'fourth',

It does start out fairly well IMO but the continued struggle back & forth between Dean & the Angels just seemed to prolong the agony of what needed to be done.. It just kept going back & forth & wasting time w/what they could have been doing. And bringing in the old favorite characters & doing what the writers did, really ticked me off. I think it was definitely a cheap move. Not sure if they had planned a 6th season but why just obliterate all the supporting characters.. It was Stoopid. I collected all of the 1st four seasons but have no intention of owning the 5th & don't have a clue what happened in the 6th.

We had two new additions that were fantastic: Mark Pellegrino as Lucifer and Mark Sheppard as Crowley. We also had a few returns from beloved characters (SPOILERS) . . . . . . . . like Ellen, Jo, the Trickster, Pamela, Mary W, and even Ash. I definitely can't wait for this to arrive.

They've reached a point in its (very)ambitious story line where there is no turning back.  In lesser creative hands and with lesser interesting characters/performers this show would've overstayed its welcome by now.  Instead, i'm still enjoying the journey and ride with the Winchester brothers.  Can't wait for season 6.Anyway, you can read better reviews of season 5, just here to say i bought the target version with the '100th episodee featurette' bonus disc.  It's basically a 28 minute mini-doc with the cast & crew celebrating the milestone.  Pretty good, but i enjoyed last years comic-con bonus disc more.  Still, it's a nice bonus to have with the other somewhat limited extras(Bobby's apocalypse survival guide, ghostfacer's web series, commentary on episode 4 ""The End"", an unaired scene, and gag reel).  I was hoping for at least 1 commentary track with the guys and Misha Collins, just to get their take on all this out of character.  And yes, the box is the same as last year's (unpopular to many)booklet form as opposed to the more popular panoramic fold-out of seasons 1-3.So, all prices comparable, go with the target version.  Best buy has a keychain offer with their box-set if that's your preference.  And to celebrate the new release everyone is having a sale on previous seasons so there's no excuse not to introduce yourself to this great series.

Season Five shows Sam and Dean as well as the Angel Castiel trying to stop the Christian Apocalypse from happening in our current or modern time. If you pull your Bible out you will see that a lot of research went into making this season as scripturally accurate as it can be. The only part that a Christian may take issue with is the fact that they say God has stepped out of the building so to speak. (which I am sure every Christian has wondered about at one point in their life or another when there is a tragedy in the world) Now the arc angels and Lucifer try to start the Biblical Apocalypse while Sam, Dean, Bobby and Castiel try to stop it from happening.

Until the very last episode you can count on the SAME dialogue since episode one.  Sam: I made a mistake, I'm sorry. Dean: I don't wanna deal with it, I dont wanna talk about it.  Sam goes on to give a long, whiny, self-pitying explanation about his feelings and Dean looks like hes been on the toilet for an hour and cant get the business done.I think that the monster-hunting-on the road idea was excellent and that part of the writing is great, especially the variety of ghosts and monsters they run across. The writing lacks however when dealing with the emotional problems of the brothers. I feel that most, if not all, of the issues between them could have been resolved by the end of season 1 and we could have moved on to new, more interesting problems. For two brothers who are apparently as inseperable and close as they are, they sure can't stand each other and its annoying already.

1272862,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B002JVWRAO,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","I've been a fan of SUPERNATURAL for some time now. From the get go I was fascinated by the storyline that pitted two young brothers against a raging tide of formidable fantasy creatures of the night. The most amazing thing about the series is how it never stopped and never got stale; how it kept a story going that was hinted at from the first episode and played it out over time.If you've never seen the show then by all means start picking up the series in boxed sets. A basic background for the uninitiated is that the Winchester brothers, Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean (Jason Ackles) are monster hunters. When the series started, Sam had abandoned the family business and gone to college only to witness his fianc&eacute; die the same death his mother had years before, pinned to the ceiling and engulfed in flames by a yellow eyed demon. Now Sam wants revenge and rejoins with his sibling to take down all monsters and demons they come across.The boys were trained by their father who has disappeared and are part of a chain of hunters that they encounter every now and then in an episode. They also stay in touch with a man who holds more knowledge than anyone and who was sort of a surrogate father to boot, Bobby Singer (Jim Beaver). As the series progressed many things happened, including Dean's dying and being taken to Hell and Sam's learning that he held a power that could be fueled by drinking demon blood (which had terrible side effects). As angels and demons got involved the story changed from simple fighting a monster each week to discussions of the Apocalypse. And that's where season 5 opens.At the end of season 4, Sam had unwittingly opened the gates of Hell, breaking the seventh seal and setting free Satan himself. Now the brothers were on a quest to stop Satan and kill him. But as an angel, as an angel of great power, could Satan be killed? Worse yet the boys have been informed of something they never knew: Sam is the vessel of Satan while Dean is the vessel of Michael, the Archangel. By vessel we're talking the human host or body that will hold these opposing forces as they meet on the battlefield to fight their apocalyptic battle.Both refuse to allow these angels to possess them though and each week we find them searching for an answer that will prevent the apocalypse, deal with the guilt Sam feels for initiating it and find a way to get rid of Satan. Along the way they also must attempt to find God who seems to have disappeared, a search being done for the most part by renegade angel Castiel (Misha Collins) who has helped the boys on their journey.Episodes this season are fantastic with some of the most thought provoking and the most funny. Yes funny. One episode deals with a prankster they've encountered before who places them in various TV series like a CSI MIAMI satire, sitcom and GREY'S ANATOMY satire. Each is done like those series and comes up with laughs.On a more serious note, the boys find themselves dead and on the road to Heaven. What each of them views as Heaven, or their own version of it, is touching in so many ways. The question of God and why he would leave us to our own devices is brought up here and in other episodes as well. One would think that a movie that involved demon fighting and a ton of dark images would not bode well for those with religious beliefs. But the fact is that through it all the idea of faith runs strong from beginning to end.Season 5 focuses almost solely on the attempt to find a way to rein in Satan and deny him the use of Sam's body, to end the Apocalypse and to prevent the four horsemen from releasing their ills against humanity. It's a journey that holds your interest from start to finish. And it's a credit to the cast and crew that they can make you believe the story they are telling, to render portrayals that never get stale, to make you feel for these characters and to make you want to know the story of Sam and Dean from start to finish.",5,COME HELL OR HIGH WATER,1306540800,"05 28, 2011",2011,3960,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'SUPERNATURAL', 'time', 'now', 'get', 'go', 'was', 'fascinated', 'storyline', 'pitted', 'two', 'young', 'brothers', 'raging', 'tide', 'formidable', 'fantasy', 'creatures', 'night', 'most', 'amazing', 'thing', 'series', 'how', 'never', 'stopped', 'never', 'got', 'stale', 'how', 'kept', 'story', 'going', 'was', 'hinted', 'first', 'episode', 'played', 'out', 'time.If', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'show', 'then', 'means', 'start', 'picking', 'up', 'series', 'boxed', 'sets', 'basic', 'background', 'uninitiated', 'Winchester', 'brothers', 'Sam', 'Jared', 'Padalecki', 'Dean', 'Jason', 'Ackles', 'are', 'monster', 'hunters', 'When', 'series', 'started', 'Sam', 'had', 'abandoned', 'family', 'business', 'gone', 'college', 'only', 'witness', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'same', 'death', 'mother', 'had', 'years', 'pinned', 'ceiling', 'engulfed', 'flames', 'yellow', 'eyed', 'demon', 'Now', 'Sam', 'revenge', 'sibling', 'take', 'down', 'monsters', 'demons', 'come', 'across.The', 'boys', 'were', 'trained', 'father', 'who', 'disappeared', 'are', 'part', 'chain', 'hunters', 'encounter', 'now', 'then', 'episode', 'also', 'stay', 'touch', 'man', 'who', 'more', 'knowledge', 'anyone', 'who', 'was', 'sort', 'surrogate', 'father', 'boot', 'Bobby', 'Singer', 'Jim', 'Beaver', 'series', 'progressed', 'many', 'things', 'happened', 'including', 'Dean', 'dying', 'being', 'taken', 'Hell', 'Sam', 'learning', 'held', 'power', 'could', 'be', 'fueled', 'drinking', 'demon', 'blood', 'had', 'terrible', 'side', 'effects', 'angels', 'demons', 'got', 'involved', 'story', 'changed', 'simple', 'fighting', 'monster', 'week', 'discussions', 'Apocalypse', 'where', 'season', '5', 'end', 'season', '4', 'Sam', 'had', 'unwittingly', 'opened', 'gates', 'Hell', 'breaking', 'seventh', 'seal', 'setting', 'free', 'Satan', 'Now', 'brothers', 'were', 'quest', 'stop', 'Satan', 'kill', 'angel', 'angel', 'great', 'power', 'could', 'Satan', 'be', 'killed', 'Worse', 'yet', 'boys', 'have', 'been', 'informed', 'something', 'never', 'knew', 'Sam', 'vessel', 'Satan', 'Dean', 'vessel', 'Michael', 'Archangel', 'vessel', ""'re"", 'talking', 'human', 'host', 'body', 'will', 'hold', 'opposing', 'forces', 'meet', 'battlefield', 'fight', 'apocalyptic', 'battle.Both', 'refuse', 'allow', 'angels', 'possess', 'week', 'find', 'searching', 'answer', 'will', 'prevent', 'apocalypse', 'deal', 'guilt', 'Sam', 'feels', 'initiating', 'find', 'way', 'get', 'rid', 'Satan', 'way', 'also', 'must', 'attempt', 'find', 'God', 'who', 'have', 'disappeared', 'search', 'being', 'done', 'most', 'part', 'renegade', 'angel', 'Castiel', 'Misha', 'Collins', 'who', 'helped', 'boys', 'journey.Episodes', 'season', 'are', 'fantastic', 'most', 'thought', 'provoking', 'most', 'funny', 'Yes', 'funny', 'One', 'episode', 'deals', 'prankster', ""'ve"", 'encountered', 'who', 'various', 'TV', 'series', 'CSI', 'MIAMI', 'satire', 'sitcom', 'GREY', 'ANATOMY', 'satire', 'done', 'series', 'up', 'laughs.On', 'more', 'serious', 'note', 'boys', 'find', 'dead', 'road', 'Heaven', 'What', 'views', 'Heaven', 'own', 'version', 'touching', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'question', 'God', 'why', 'would', 'leave', 'own', 'devices', 'brought', 'up', 'here', 'other', 'episodes', 'well', 'One', 'would', 'think', 'movie', 'involved', 'demon', 'fighting', 'ton', 'dark', 'images', 'would', 'not', 'bode', 'well', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'fact', 'idea', 'faith', 'runs', 'strong', 'beginning', 'end.Season', '5', 'focuses', 'almost', 'solely', 'attempt', 'find', 'way', 'rein', 'Satan', 'deny', 'use', 'Sam', 'body', 'end', 'Apocalypse', 'prevent', 'four', 'horsemen', 'releasing', 'ills', 'humanity', 'journey', 'interest', 'start', 'finish', 'credit', 'cast', 'crew', 'can', 'make', 'believe', 'story', 'are', 'telling', 'render', 'portrayals', 'never', 'get', 'stale', 'make', 'feel', 'characters', 'make', 'want', 'know', 'story', 'Sam', 'Dean', 'start', 'finish']",N/A

This season has alot to deal with heaven & hell, demons vs angels. The show is very entertaining,both jensen and jared are good actors,along with other cast members that contribute to this production.Episode list:Sympathy for the Devil#1Lucifer's prison has been opened by Sam's successful attempt to kill Lilith. As the gate to Hell fully opens, the Winchester brothers are rescued by an unknown force and teleported into a plane, watching in horror the start of the Apocalypse. In an encounter with the prophet Chuck it is revealed that Castiel was blown to pieces by an archangel. When they try to figure out what to do next, they are attacked by their old enemy Meg and a possessed Bobby. The brothers learn that there is a weapon strong enough to defeat the Devil--Michael's Sword. They set off to find it, but instead burst upon Zachariah, who reveals that Dean is in fact Michael's Sword, the human vessel of the Archangel Michael. However, he refuses to provide his mind and body for the angels' plans even when Zachariah threatens to kill Sam and Bobby. As Zachariah begins to torture Sam and Dean, Castiel, miraculously revived, appears and tells him to leave. Meanwhile, Lucifer is trying to convince his own vessel, a man whose family has been slaughtered by a killer, to let him take over his body so he can face God and seek justice.Good God, Y'All!#2Bobby is still in the hospital and quite bitter about being in a wheelchair. When Castiel arrives, Bobby orders him to heal him, but Castiel says he's been cut off from Heaven. He tells Dean that he wants to find God, the only one who can defeat Lucifer. Castiel borrows Dean's pendant, which has the ability to indicate God's presence by glowing brightly. Suddenly, Bobby receives a frantic call from Bobby's hunter friend Rufus, who is in a town swarming with demons. Sam and Dean go to the town and can't find Rufus, but instead find Ellen Harvelle. She and Jo have been hunting together and Jo has disappeared like Rufus. When they do find Jo and Rufus, they appear to be possessed by demons--and strangely, they seem to think Sam, Dean and the others are also possessed. In fact, the demons are no demons at all, but hallucinations brought about by War, one of the Four Horseman of the Apocalypse. Sam and Dean hunt him down and cut off his ring finger, because his ring controls the hallucinations. In the end, Sam tells Dean he thinks that they should go their separate ways, and so they part.Free to Be You and Me#3Not sure he trusts himself anymore, Sam decides to give up hunting and live a ""normal"" life. At night, his dead girlfriend Jessica visits him and tells him that people can never change despite their efforts. Dean, intending on stopping the Apocalypse, continues hunting on his own and teams up with Castiel to find the Archangel Raphael, as Castiel believes Raphael knows God's location. They find Raphael's vessel and lure him out, but are no closer to finding God's location. Raphael even claims that God is dead. After fighting off fellow hunters who wanted Sam to drink demon blood in order to exorcise some demons, he gets another late-night visit from Jessica, who turns out to be Lucifer disguising himself as Sam's deceased girlfriend all along. He says that Nick's body was just Plan B, and that his true vessel is supposed to be Sam. He is convinced that eventually, without any trickery or lies, Sam will agree to be his vessel, although Sam adamantly disagrees.The End#4Sam calls Dean late at night and says that he wants to rejoin Dean in the battle of the Apocalypse, but Dean tells Sam that they're better off apart. Later, Dean awakens five years in the future in an abandoned city and is attacked by humans who have been infected with a demonic disease, the Croatoan virus. After Dean has escaped the assault, Zachariah appears to him and explains that this world is the result of Dean saying no to being Michael's vessel. He then discovers a group of survivors led by his Future self. When he sneaks into the camp, he is captured by his Future self, who explains that the virus is Lucifer's endgame for destroying mankind. Supposedly, Sam did not survive the showdown. Later it is revealed that Sam didn't die, but did in fact say yes to Lucifer, thus letting him in. After having acquired the Colt from demons, Future Dean plans on killing Lucifer and ending the Apocalypse. Walking straight into a trap, Future Dean is killed by Lucifer. Lucifer reveals that, whatever choices Dean will make, he will always end up in the same situation. Lucifer leaves and Zachariah appears, teleporting Dean back to the year 2009. When Dean refuses to be Michael's vessel, even after he's seen what his decision might result in, Zachariah attempts to persuade him with force. Castiel saves Dean from Zachariah's wrath just in time. Ultimately, Dean and Sam reconcile and decide to begin hunting together again.Fallen Idols#5Sam and Dean are reunited and on the hunt again. They reach a small town and investgate a string of very strange murders. A man who has found James Dean's car ""Little Bastard"" is found dead as if he has been involved in a major car crash. Another man is murdered by someone who looks just like Abraham Lincoln. Suspecting that the murders are the work of famous ghosts, the boys do research at the local wax museum where Sam is attacked by what seems to be the ghost of Mahatma Gandhi. Shortly afterwards, two girls report to the police that their friend was kidnapped by Paris Hilton, which leaves the brothers speechless. After finding peculiar seeds in the victims' stomachs, they break into the museum's construction area where they do find Paris Hilton--who is in fact a pagan god in disguise, trying to settle down after its old home, a deep forest in Eastern Europe, has been cut down. By touching their possessions, the god can turn itself into famous people and kill their fans in order to feed on their blood. While fighting the Leshi, Dean references Padalecki's and Hilton's role in House of Wax, saying he has never seen it. In the end, Sam kills ""Paris Hilton"" with an iron axe. Before leaving town, Dean tells Sam that starting the Apocalypse isn't his fault alone as he himself has broken the first seal and that they shouldn't think about the whole vessel thing too much but instead fight together.I Believe the Children Are Our Future#6In Alliance, Nebraska, people are being killed by practical joke devices such as itching powder and joybuzzers. On top of that, a very odd looking Tooth Fairy extracts a man's teeth. It turns out that an eleven-year-old boy named Jesse is the reason for all of this. Everything he believes becomes reality. After searching his birth records, Sam and Dean find out that the boy was adopted, so they visit his biological mother, who lives across the state. She tells the brothers that she was impregnated by a demon possessing her and gave up her child for adoption after giving birth to him. Castiel informs the Winchesters that Jesse is an Antichrist, a being half human, half demon, imbued with essentially unlimited powers. Therefore, an Antichrist would be Lucifer's special weapon in the war against Heaven and, as a serious threat, needs to be eliminated. However, Sam and Dean believe that Jesse would not turn evil if he is taken somewhere safe. When they try to convince Jesse to come with them, the demon which conceived him interferes and pins them to the wall. It is again possessing Jesse's biological mother. After listening to the demon, Jesse renders it unable to speak in order to hear what Sam has to say. Sam tells Jesse that he has a choice and that it will haunt him forever if he makes the wrong decision. After that, Jesse exorcises the demon from his mother. Pretending he wants to say goodbye to his foster parents, he goes upstairs and vanishes into thin air, protected by his powers, which makes it impossible to track him down.The Curious Case of Dean Winchester#7Mysterious deaths caused by inexplicable aging lead Sam, Dean and Bobby to a warlock named Patrick, who gambles for high stakes. He challenges people to a poker game in which they don't play for money, but for life years represented by magical poker chips. Bobby sees this game as an opportunity to escape his wheelchair and accepts Patrick's challenge. Losing the game, he begins to age rapidly. Dean wants to save Bobby and challenges the warlock to win back Bobby's lost years to prevent him from dying. He bets 50 years, of which he uses 25 to reverse Bobby's aging process. However, Dean can't keep up with the warlock's poker skills and loses, which causes him to age. Together, the Winchester brothers and Bobby try to find a way to save Dean. They get unexpected help from Patrick's accomplice, who thinks that living forever is not natural and causes too much pain. She gives them a spell, one which can reverse the effects of Patrick's magic. Sam challenges the warlock to a poker game while Bobby and Dean perform the ritual. One ingredient of the spell is a trace of Patrick's DNA, so they use a toothpick supposedly used by him. The spell turns out to be ineffective since the toothpick was not really used by Patrick. When frantically searching for another object with the warlock's DNA on it, Dean suffers a heart attack, but Sam wins the game just in time to save Dean.Changing Channels#8While investigating a homicide apparently executed by the Incredible Hulk, Sam and Dean are trapped inside TV land. They suspect the Trickster is the reason for it, and attempt to track him down. Sam suggests they ask the Trickster for help fighting the Apocalypse, and Dean reluctantly agrees. They encounter him several times, but are unable to trap him until Dean remembers a warning from Castiel about the Trickster, which leads the brothers to believe the Trickster is in fact a far more powerful creature than a simple demi-god. They manage to lure him and trap him in a burning circle of holy oil. Since the Trickster is unable to escape, it confirms their suspicions that he is actually an angel. He applauds them and admits he's actually the Archangel Gabriel, who voluntarily fell from Grace several years before as he grew tired of watching his brothers fight each other. He trapped Sam and Dean because he wants them to agree to be Lucifer's and Michael's vessels, respectively, in order to end the Apocalypse. Gabriel also states that the lives of Sam and Dean mirror the lives of Lucifer and Michael, since Sam rebelled against his father while Dean remained obedient. Dean still refuses to say yes to becoming a vessel, but before they leave, he frees Gabriel from his trap and accuses him of simply being too afraid to stand up against his own family.That's just a taste of what it's like.

I think they will probaly have a spin off of this show maybe with bobby and cass. dont know but where can you go though. they killed everything from ghost to now fighting the devil. so dont know if the show will have a spin off or if it did what direction it would take. but then again im no writer. this seaason they have to put lucifer back in hell after sam unnowingly realeased him and in order to do that they have to get the four rings of the hoursemen then get lucifer back at the gate so they can open it and put him back in hell. all the while why dean trys to avoid the angels and keep micheal from takeing over his body to fight lucifer and killing almost every human on the planet. this show has it all if you watched it for the last 4 seasons like I did. the charactoer went from young boys just getting started in the life to killing vampire in their sleep. they both struggled with haveing to live the life and not have a home to call their own or loosing both parents. to just fighting each other. sometimes fun to watch and other time sadd. you can really get into the life of the characters in this show and c the pain and uncertainty that they go throught with makeing the tuff decisions every day. exspecally dean he went from a wise cracking tough guy to a down on his knees praying for some help average joe. and sam went from this college whole life in front of him familly man to a guy trying to be the tough guy because he sees his big brother struggling hero. know he messed up big time with the choices he made and trying so hard to make up for it and prove himself again. you even see the characters bobby and cass change from when they first appeered. this show just rocks and I dont know any show that can compete with this show in haveing it all.

1272876,A3QDZ0LF2AJGYA,B002JVWRAO,rantboi,"[3, 4]","(Some spoilers)Just my luck! I've been watching this show on DVD. I borrowed the first four seasons from the library. The first season was okay (too ""monster-of-the-week"" for me) but it got better towards the end, and I loved seasons 2-4. So I decided to support the show and bought season five pretty much blind (didn't want to spoil it) because I loved the show so much. Well, I found this season to be the worst.I really don't know what happened. Did their budget get a huge cut? Did the creator/writers just stop caring? Even the two main actors seemed to be phoning this one in. (Jensen Ackles' super deep manly voice was very distracting and his manly ""grunt"" had me laughing out loud during an emotional scene). Frankly, most of this season was painful to watch. After the season four finale where the devil gets set free, you'd think that season five would be awesome. Not really. Lucifer is the most boring character this show has had. Remember how scary the Yellow Eyed Demon and Lilith were? They could eat Lucifer for lunch. And worst of all, Lucifer barely gets any screen time in this season at all. I heard the creator had a five year plan for this show, so I still can't believe how bad year five turned out. Who could plan such a weak ending?Sam and Dean are running around like chickens with their heads cut off. Cas doesn't do much of anything. Bobby hates his life. In this season one ridiculous thing after another happens. We find out that Sam is a vessel for Lucifer and Dean is a vessel for Michael (an archangel who can defeat Lucifer). Really? Can't get any cornier than that. The brothers have the same conversations over and over and over again, moaning about the same things but not really doing much of anything for the whole season. The season finale, Swan Song, is the worst most anti-climatic finale I've seen of any show. There's a lot of questions in this show about where God is in all this (you know, while the Apocalypse is going down and all) and what I got from the finale (and the first episode of season five) is this: God is Deus ex machina! If your favorite character happens to die (as long as it's not a female character, of course) God will just bring them back to life in a snap and everything will go back to normal. Just awful, awful writing for a show that's been so solid for the first four years. It was getting progressively better and better in my opinion, and season five was a huge step backwards. Another thing that bothered me is the complete lack of strong female characters (even evil ones) throughout the whole season (except for one-off appearances in maybe 4 or 5 out of 22 episodes). There wasn't much in terms of action in this season either. The Apocalypse-themed episodes were especially problematic. The whole thing seemed like an after-thought.I'm being way too generous with the three stars here, but there are some episodes I liked/loved this season: Abandon All Hope (thank god for Crowley!), Swap Meat, The Song Remains the Same, and My Bloody Valentine stood out especially for me. Overall, I think I liked/loved less than half the episodes this season. Other episodes were filler and some were just plain awful.I don't have much hope for season six, but it can't be worse than season five, right? At least this show didn't end with Swan Song. It deserves much better than that.",3,"The weakest season: ""Well hello, Deus Ex Machina!""",1285286400,"09 24, 2010",2010,3353,"['spoilers', 'Just', 'luck', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'show', 'DVD', 'borrowed', 'first', 'four', 'seasons', 'library', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'okay', 'too', 'monster-of-the-week', 'got', 'better', 'end', 'loved', 'seasons', '2-4', 'decided', 'support', 'show', 'bought', 'season', 'five', 'pretty', 'much', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'loved', 'show', 'so', 'much', 'Well', 'found', 'season', 'be', 'worst.I', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'Did', 'budget', 'get', 'huge', 'cut', 'Did', 'creator/writers', 'just', 'stop', 'caring', 'Even', 'two', 'main', 'actors', 'seemed', 'be', 'phoning', 'one', 'Jensen', 'Ackles', 'super', 'deep', 'manly', 'voice', 'was', 'very', 'distracting', 'manly', 'grunt', 'had', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'emotional', 'scene', 'Frankly', 'most', 'season', 'was', 'painful', 'watch', 'season', 'four', 'finale', 'where', 'devil', 'set', 'free', ""'d"", 'think', 'season', 'five', 'would', 'be', 'awesome', 'Not', 'really', 'Lucifer', 'most', 'boring', 'character', 'show', 'had', 'Remember', 'how', 'scary', 'Yellow', 'Eyed', 'Demon', 'Lilith', 'were', 'could', 'eat', 'Lucifer', 'lunch', 'worst', 'Lucifer', 'barely', 'screen', 'time', 'season', 'heard', 'creator', 'had', 'five', 'year', 'plan', 'show', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', 'bad', 'year', 'five', 'turned', 'out', 'Who', 'could', 'plan', 'weak', 'ending', 'Sam', 'Dean', 'are', 'running', 'chickens', 'heads', 'cut', 'off', 'Cas', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'anything', 'Bobby', 'life', 'season', 'one', 'ridiculous', 'thing', 'happens', 'find', 'out', 'Sam', 'vessel', 'Lucifer', 'Dean', 'vessel', 'Michael', 'archangel', 'who', 'can', 'defeat', 'Lucifer', 'Really', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'cornier', 'brothers', 'have', 'same', 'conversations', 'over', 'again', 'moaning', 'same', 'things', 'not', 'really', 'doing', 'much', 'anything', 'whole', 'season', 'season', 'finale', 'Swan', 'Song', 'worst', 'most', 'anti-climatic', 'finale', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'show', 'lot', 'questions', 'show', 'where', 'God', 'know', 'Apocalypse', 'going', 'down', 'what', 'got', 'finale', 'first', 'episode', 'season', 'five', 'God', 'Deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'favorite', 'character', 'die', 'as', 'long', 'not', 'female', 'character', 'course', 'God', 'will', 'just', 'bring', 'back', 'life', 'snap', 'everything', 'will', 'go', 'back', 'normal', 'Just', 'awful', 'awful', 'writing', 'show', 'been', 'so', 'solid', 'first', 'four', 'years', 'was', 'getting', 'progressively', 'better', 'better', 'opinion', 'season', 'five', 'was', 'huge', 'step', 'backwards', 'thing', 'bothered', 'complete', 'lack', 'strong', 'female', 'characters', 'even', 'evil', 'ones', 'whole', 'season', 'one-off', 'appearances', 'maybe', '4', '5', '22', 'episodes', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'terms', 'action', 'season', 'Apocalypse-themed', 'episodes', 'were', 'especially', 'problematic', 'whole', 'thing', 'seemed', 'after-thought.I', ""'m"", 'being', 'way', 'too', 'generous', 'three', 'stars', 'here', 'are', 'episodes', 'liked/loved', 'season', 'Abandon', 'Hope', 'thank', 'god', 'Crowley', 'Swap', 'Meat', 'Song', 'Same', 'My', 'Bloody', 'Valentine', 'stood', 'out', 'especially', 'Overall', 'think', 'liked/loved', 'less', 'episodes', 'season', 'Other', 'episodes', 'were', 'filler', 'were', 'just', 'plain', 'awful.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'hope', 'season', 'six', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'worse', 'season', 'five', 'right', 'least', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'end', 'Swan', 'Song', 'much', 'better']",N/A

After all, how much more depressing can it get? Turns out, ALOT more.S5 would've been a so-so season if it hadn't been for once again brilliant performances from Jared and Jensen. With the release of Luci and the on-going divide of Sam and Dean, it seemed like all hope was lost. Rest assured, it is not. By the end of the season, they showed the fans that there is still love going on with the brothers and hopefully, more to come with S6.But I warn you, for all those that are new to show, S4 and 5 are the seasons that test you. And if you're still watching them, you deserve a gold star.I would say the only positive thing to come from S5 was Castiel.

And episodes like The End, Free to Be you and me, Point of no Return, My bloody Valentine and even it's finale Swan Song are up there are as some really great moments in SN history.  I could rewatch all of those  I mentioned and still be entertained.  Ben Edlund is a dark comic genius.  And the Devil was expertly written and played throughout leaving each episode he was in wanting more.  Don't get me wrong this is a MUST for anyone who likes Horror with a side of comedy.I won't say more about those episode mentioned above, just enjoy them and now comes the critique.  ""Fallen Idol"" -ack Paris Hilton, really?  ""Children are our future"" -great another all powerful kid out there who can squash everything with his mind, oh and it was so close to being a good episode, ""Dead men Don't wear plaids""- all the characters totally acting out of character and a waste of Zombies! BUT WORST OF ALL ""MEAT SWAP"".  That last one was painful to watch and I want to scratch it off the DVD.  Just don't watch it if you love the Winchesters, really.Now about the DVD extras....  I have watched my DVR episodes several time while I waited for the DVD to come out, hoping to get a little more insight into the season.  Especially the last season with Eric Kripke at the helm and we get ONE audio Commentary???? And a few less then encompassing featurettes. I love the commentaries and was so hoping for one for ""Point of No return"" ""Free to be You and Me"" or Swan Song.  Now ""the End"" was great but really guys, would it kill you to take another hour or two and give us a few more.  That is why we love the box sets, faithful fans want to know what you were thinking when you do major challenges to our characters. Hear about the obstacles and cool things you had to do to make the episodes.  Just so disappointing to be shorted on that.  I would have even loved if the DP or Special effects person did one if the writers and producers were too busy.  Ah well, opportunity lost.In short get this set, it is worth it.

1272892,A1PNH6WOANE0SD,B002JVWRAO,"S. Christensen ""reveuse""","[2, 2]","SOME SPOILERSGoing into Season 5 of Supernatural all the pieces so painstakingly gathered over the course of the first four seasons are finally--and enticingly--set in place. Sam is addicted to demon blood and has fulfilled Azazel's every hope for him by siding with Ruby over Dean and killing Lilith and, by that, unwittingly releasing Lucifer into the world for an Armageddon-like smackdown engineered by angels and demons alike. Dean, for his part, broke the first seal leading to the Apocalypse when he broke in Hell and has been told by the angels that he's now the only one who can stop it. The tension couldn't be greater. The foundations of the boys' relationship have been razed. Sam has a demon-blood addiction to fight and is apparently the vessel of choice for Lucifer himself, while Dean has angels breathing down his neck insisting that he step up and become the vessel of the archangel Michael, whatever that might mean for him and Sam. Once more, this time above all, Dean may yet have to save or kill Sam. The Devil is roaming free, ready to party. And the Earth and the lives of all the billions on it are now in the hands of the two guys whose mistakes started it all...Season 5 has its moments, but I think it ultimately threw away nearly all of the potential it started with. The Apocalypse itself seemed distant, a looming threat that never really gained much immediacy. Worse, the series finale--the end of a story arc developed over 5 seasons--was sadly anticlimactic. Let's just say you have to completely shut off your brain to find the canon solution to the problem remotely believable, especially when at least three other potential strategies with far more promise for defeating Lucifer are presented earlier in the season but dropped. I didn't go in with any great expectations, but I found myself cringing and laughing in disbelief at the the dialogue and absurdities of it all. Yet the episode was even in a meta moment smugly dismissive of any fan who was dissatisfied with what Kripke gave them. Lucifer seemed content to do nothing truly significant through nearly the whole season. There were far too many comic episodes that not only weren't particularly funny, but didn't contribute a whit to the overall storyline. The angels were every bit as corrupt and conniving and heedless of humanity as the demons, and if I'd hoped the archangels would be more interesting than the rank and file I was sorely disappointed because they were even more whiny, with daddy issues. Even Heaven was treated as a Stepford parody of anything that would actually merit the name. (If there are no good guys, and heaven is just a bunch of memories that's really hardly any better than Hell, why does it matter anyway if Lucifer wins?)Then there are the glaring plot holes and inconsistencies and the ridiculous way certain points were retconned. It was as if the writers honestly gave up trying to give the story any coherency whatsoever with prior seasons. While in prior seasons unnecessary collateral damage (especially to possessed innocents) and Sam's demon blood addiction and ends-justifies-means morality were treated as BAD things, S5 pretty much threw out any such nice scruples. John and Mary Winchester weren't necessarily in love; they were forced together by cupids just to produce their sons. The Trickster that plagued Sam especially was--surprise, surprise!--the archangel Gabriel, incognito. Hellhounds can suddenly be sent after anyone, whether or not they've made a deal. (If demons could set hellhounds on people at their leisure, why don't they?) Dean's amulet, given to him by Sam so many years ago, is actually a God detector, except that the prophet Chuck is evidently God, so the God detector is evidently broken around the one it's supposed to detect and the storyline of Castiel's search for God is dropped like a hot potato.Most importantly, storyline after storyline about the brothers themselves was dropped or mangled. Sam's addiction storyline petered out and was finally abandoned. He doesn't seem, in the end, to have truly overcome any of the flaws or hangups that got him into this mess to begin with, and though the season gives lip service to Dean's depression and loss of faith in Sam, all of that is somehow suddenly all better with a little trust from Sam and comes to nothing; the status quo is restored and Dean's big lesson is that Sam is a big boy so Dean shouldn't get in his way. Dean was somehow an overbearing bully to Sam all of those years and forced Sam into Ruby's arms, though through the first four seasons we never saw anybody stop Sam from doing something Sam really put his mind to and we saw Dean deferring to Sam plenty of times. Not to mention that Sam's most critical choices regarding Ruby were made while Dean wasn't there to harass Sam about them in the first place. Dean was supposedly the only one who could stop the Apocalypse and, by saying yes to Michael, save the world from Lucifer, but suddenly he's told by Death that he's no longer part of the story and replaced as Michael's vessel by a bit character at the critical moment with absolutely no trouble. Sam totally ignores Dean when their plan goes south and Dean tries to convince him not to say Yes to Lucifer after all. In fact, even getting beat up by Lucifer in Sam's body makes no difference. Dean's ultimate contribution to stopping the Apocalypse is driving up the Impala so that Sam can see a little toy soldier stuck in the ashtray that somehow allows Sam to take control of an archangel...though Sam earlier in the series was powerless when possessed by small-timer like Meg and there is absolutely no precedent in canon for overcoming angelic possession, much less possession by the Devil himself. When Dean tries to interfere, neither of two archangels, both of which want to fight and have to see him as a nuisance, get rid of him or send him off to Timbuktu or simply set up some kind of force field to keep him out of the way?There are some good moments...mostly Dean ones. I really think this season cheated Sam in particular in the characterization department, but it did a number on Bobby and Castiel too. My suggestion? Enjoy it for what it's worth, but don't invest much in it.",3,Hating to hate this season...,1293408000,"12 27, 2010",2010,6242,"['SOME', 'SPOILERSGoing', 'Season', '5', 'Supernatural', 'pieces', 'so',

It's become a turgid, predictable, fatuous piece of evangelical Crap. Angels, devils, Satan, Armageddon, and their imaginary friend GOD. (And their book of fairy tales, of course.) ""The opiate of the masses"" They've also changed the format: instead of being about Sam & Dave, it's now about Sam & Dave & an angel--a three character show instead of a two-character show. (And that actor who plays the new leading man! A triple threat: uninteresting, unattractive, unpleasant--also annoying--Oh well.) They ruined X FILES, MOONLIGHTING, TORCHWOOD, etal, by evolving them into something that seems to be the opposite (in a way) of what they were originally. I loved this show so very much--it wasn't untill the fourth season's final two-parter that I began trembling in dread and lost respect for the writers because I could see where they were going; and my forebodeing prediction has, sadly, come true.

1272905,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B002JVWRAO,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[4, 4]","With the fifth season of ""Supernatural"" Lucifer broke through to our world and the angels hope of a final battle between Heaven and Hell came one step closer. Sam and Dean Winchester had their plates full as they battled the Four Horsemen of the Apocalpyse in an effort to try and prevent the end of the world. As always the show was entertaining with a number of strong episodes and while season five didn't quite deliver in the way that season four did, it was still a very good season with a number of clever episodes. Highlights include ""Changing Channels"" where Dean and Sam get plopped into ""TV Land"" as Dean calls it and ""Hammer of the Gods"" where all the OTHER gods not mentioned in the Christian Bible meet up because they are ticked off that it's the end of the world and want to do something about it...that something includes kidnapping Dean and Sam.""Supernatural"" has always stood apart from other series like it because of its ironic touch in both the writing and directing, as well as the strong performances from series regulars Jard Padalecki, Jensen Ackles, Jim Beaver and the marvelous Misha Collins (who became a regular with the fourth season as the angel Castiel).The Blu-ray for ""Supernatural: The Complete Fifth Season"" looks quite nice with deep, rich blacks and a nice representation of the washed out colors that are a hallmark of the series. I would imagine that the DVD looks quite nice as well since Warner has always done a nice job of presenting the series in that format as well.The option to skip the opening ""Then"" recap didn't make it to the menu this time why they forgot to include this as part of the authoring of the disc, I'm not sure of--perhaps they just forgot. A minor flaw but considering that most of the other Blu-rays or DVDs had this option (I'm not sure about the season five DVD), it is a bit annoying but not a deal breaker.Although the studio isn't quite as generous with the extras this time around (there's only one commentary track on the fourth episode ""The End"" and only a series of deleted scenes for the episode ""The Real Ghostbusters"") we do get sort of an interactive series of short featurettes all under the title of "" Supernatural Apocalypse Survival Guide: Bobby's Exclusive Video Collection"" and the ""Ghostfacers: The Web Series"" as extras here.The fifth season of the show suffered from padding especially when compared to the previous one (for example ""99 Problems"" where a militia group battling demons discovers that they have evil among them has an interesting premise that receives pedestrian execution all around) with a couple of episodes not quite living up to their potential and a sense that the story arc from season four was dragging on a bit too long. Still, the writers/producers Eric Kripke (also the creator of the show), Ben Edlund and Sera Gamble still delivered a series of terrific episodes that were highlights for season five.There were also some fans who were a bit disappointed that the season finale wasn't bigger and bolder but given that the series was working on a TV budget and not a feature film budget along with the fact that the show has always focused on the characters more than the visual effects, I found it satisfying for the most part.Overall the fifth season of ""Supernatural"" (which was originally to be the last season which explains why some characters that we've learned to love over the course of the series were killed)continued to explore a series of strong, suspenseful, amusing and insightful stories. While there were a few filler episodes during the season or some that were a bit ordinary in execution, overall the fifth season was extremely good and quite strong.The changes for the fifth season including the elimination of some characters does allow for a clean slate  for the sixth season allowing for an entirely new season long story arc that will reverse the dynamics of the first season--i.e., Dean doesn't want to be a hunter as he has settled into a family life for the first time and Sam wants Dean to continue--which will prove interesting)continues to deliver chills, thrills and spills with plenty of humor. The best episodes of season five are as good (and a couple are among the best the series produced)as the best from previous seasons although one gets the sense that this season would have benefited from a smaller number of episodes.Fans will be pleased with the set and I can highly recommend this season as it brings the five year story arc to a satisfying close tying all of the elements established in the first episodes of season one together very nicely.Highly recommended.",4,"The Devil IS in the details for the fifth season of ""Supernatural""",1283817600,"09 7,
