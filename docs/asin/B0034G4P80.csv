Second, what did she do other than stand there and let her hair be blown around by the off screen wind machines?

I have to say it was really good and better then I expected. One thing about this movie was it had a good storyline that was not complicated which sometimes with these movies that make you use your imagination to much. The story is about a father who has two sons and needs to choose one to be king. He ends of choosing thor nd his brother is not jealous at first but as time goes on his jealousy starts to grow. Thor's main problem is that he is hard headed and doesn't listen to anyone this gets to his father releasing him from his duty as king and sending him back to earth with real humans. Another thing that adds to this movie is there is allot of funny moments on the side. Almost like side comments that keep your attention to the movie and gives you some humor to go along with it. A love angle is added when Thor meets a girl who at first is unsure of him but at the end of the day she ends up falling for him. To say the least there are allot of twist and turns in this movie. it is for the better and as for the special affects I would say those are done pretty well to. Overall you have to see this when it comes out on DVD even if its a dollar red box night it is well worth your time.

The motivations of many of the characters were never quite clear to me. Thor's change of character after spending, what, a day or two as human, was not believable, nor was his love for Jane. If they had left him mortal, say for a year or two, I might have bought it, but not such a brief time. But the action sequences mostly carry the picture as does the sound.

One wonders how a movie like this, which I was happy to watch with younger children (7 & 9) after seeing myself first, has the same rating as something like the Twilight franchise? Perhaps this deserved less, others more or we need a middle rating in between?Anyway, the movie itself.Both the 3D version specifically and the BD version in this set have phenomenal pictures and sound, the opening part of the movie is quite darkly lit, but that is nothing to do with the reproduction here. The 3D is also nicely done, controlled like Avatar, without the director feeling the need to throw things out of the screen all the time and say ""this is 3D!"" like the rather ridiculous ""Drive Angry"".The story is an old and has been well told in many formats over the years, young petulant and headstrong Thor get's on the wrong side of his father the King, thanks to some back stabbing connivance by younger brother Loki, and ends up on Earth, to find himself, and learn humility, sacrifice and how to be a king, not just a warrior.The action is well interspersed and the movie moves at a nice pace, plenty of eye candy, some humor, and enough references to the upcoming Avengers flick next year to keep the comic book fans happy.That said, and to reiterate the comments of others, this is a stand alone movie, whether you are familiar with the comics, Norse legends or not, and is well directed by Kenneth Branagh.Good old fashioned storytelling it is, the movie opens strong, builds well, and ends satisfyingly, with enough of a crack in the door for a sequel, or to whet your appetite for the upcoming  aforementioned Avengers movie.Heroes, villains, battles, betrayal, loyalty, and action abound, even the love interest is tastefully handled and compliments the story.I for one was very impressed with relative newcomer Chris Hemsworth (I don't really count his cameo at the beginning on the Star Trek remake) and think he will definitely be one to watch.5 stars for great entertainment, relax and enjoy with the whole family, just remember some of the scary stuff will be too much for very young viewers probably.",5,"Family friendly fun, good old fashioned story telling",1316304000,"09 18, 2011",2011,2990,"['get', 'movie', 'couple', 'points', 'think', 'worthy', 'mention.First', 'are', 'one', 'people', 'trying', 'embrace', 'new', '3D', 'wave', 'have', 'shelled', 'out', 'equipment', 'do', 'so', 'shame', 'can', 'not', 'buy', 'bare', '3D', 'version', 'film.DVD', 'now', 'Blu-Ray', 'have', 'always', 'given', 'choice', 'standard', '1', 'disc', 'release', 'then', '2', '3', 'disc', 'special', 'edition', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'nice', 'have', 'harsh', 'have', 'shell', 'out', '3D', 'release', '4', 'discs', 'have', 'need', 'other', 'copies', 'perhaps', 'will', 'change', '3D', 'becomes', 'more', 'mainstream', 'affordable.Secondly', 'watching', 'movie', 'huge', 'disparity', 'broad', 'width', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'exception', 'few', 'scary', 'images', 'film', 'sex', 'bad', 'language', 'very', 'little', 'offend', 'violence', 'stylized', 'succinct', 'One', 'how', 'movie', 'was', 'happy', 'watch', 'younger', 'children', '7', '9', 'seeing', 'first', 'same', 'rating', 'something', 'Twilight', 'franchise', 'Perhaps', 'deserved', 'less', 'others', 'more', 'need', 'middle', 'rating', 'Anyway', 'movie', '3D', 'version', 'specifically', 'BD', 'version', 'set', 'have', 'phenomenal', 'pictures', 'sound', 'opening', 'part', 'movie', 'quite', 'darkly', 'lit', 'nothing', 'do', 'reproduction', 'here', '3D', 'also', 'nicely', 'done', 'controlled', 'Avatar', 'director', 'feeling', 'need', 'throw', 'things', 'screen', 'time', 'say', '3D', 'rather', 'ridiculous', 'Drive', 'Angry', '.The', 'story', 'old', 'been', 'well', 'told', 'many', 'formats', 'years', 'young', 'petulant', 'headstrong', 'Thor', 'get', 'wrong', 'side', 'father', 'King', 'thanks', 'back', 'stabbing', 'connivance', 'younger', 'brother', 'Loki', 'up', 'Earth', 'find', 'learn', 'humility', 'sacrifice', 'how', 'be', 'king', 'not', 'just', 'warrior.The', 'action', 'well', 'interspersed', 'movie', 'nice', 'pace', 'plenty', 'eye', 'candy', 'humor', 'enough', 'references', 'upcoming', 'Avengers', 'flick', 'next', 'year', 'keep', 'comic', 'book', 'fans', 'said', 'reiterate', 'comments', 'others', 'stand', 'alone', 'movie', 'are', 'familiar', 'comics', 'Norse', 'not', 'well', 'directed', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh.Good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'storytelling', 'movie', 'strong', 'builds', 'well', 'satisfyingly', 'enough', 'crack', 'door', 'sequel', 'whet', 'appetite', 'upcoming', 'aforementioned', 'Avengers', 'movie.Heroes', 'villains', 'battles', 'betrayal', 'loyalty', 'action', 'abound', 'even', 'love', 'interest', 'tastefully', 'handled', 'story.I', 'one', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'relative', 'newcomer', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'count', 'cameo', 'beginning', 'Star', 'Trek', 'remake', 'think', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'one', 'watch.5', 'stars', 'great', 'entertainment', 'relax', 'enjoy', 'whole', 'family', 'just', 'remember', 'scary', 'stuff', 'will', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'very', 'young', 'viewers', 'probably']",N/A

1324430,A2JDYUSI2RILEB,B0034G4P80,Andre Dursin,"[4, 5]","THOR is what my idea of what a comic book movie should be - big, colorful, loud, a little bit corny at times, but hugely entertaining throughout.Kenneth Branagh's unabashedly colorful and fun take on the material offers memorable production design from Bo Welch, with sets and costumes that look like they just flew off the Marvel pages (I don't think I've seen anything like the Asgard scenes since ""Flash Gordon"", with plenty of rousing action to match.Chris Hemsworth is undeniably charismatic as Odin's son, who is banished to Earth by his father (Anthony Hopkins) after putting the kingdom of Asgard in trouble with his callous actions. Unlike some other, pre-fab Aussie leading men we've seen of late (Sam Worthington, anyone?), Hemsworth is the real deal, effortlessly navigating his way through the material with the right dash of arrogance and empathy (like many of the Marvel films, there's ultimately a moral to this story). Action, humor, and fantasy all come together as Thor falls for a mere mortal grad student (Natalie Portman, so much more appealing than she was in the Star Wars prequels) who becomes infatuated with our muscle-bound hero, while Hopkins doesn't just cash the check as Odin and other roles are satisfyingly filled by the likes of Stellan Skaarsgard (Portman's professor boss), Kat Dennings (her friend), Idris Elba (Asgard's gatekeeper) and Tom Hiddelston as Loki, Thor's troubled brother who we're about to see a good deal more of in next summer's ""The Avengers.""Speaking of that much-anticipated super-hero team mash-up, the lead-in material to that picture is incorporated into the story here far more organically than ""Iron Man 2"" - Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye makes a very brief appearance but people who don't know who he is won't be sitting there, thinking that the movie has stopped dead to incorporate references to ""The Avengers.""The pacing is a little bit odd at times as the movie flips between the Asgard and Earth sequences, and if anything, could have used more character development (it's cut lean under 2 hours), but overall I was very much entertained. This is colorful, romantic genre entertainment with a dynamic Patrick Doyle score that's the most satisfying work I've heard from the composer since his Halcyon days of the mid `90s.Paramount has brought ""Thor"" to BD in a number of different flavors including a Blu-Ray/3-D Blu-Ray/DVD copy. The HD image on the Blu-Ray is expectedly strong (1080p AVC encoded widescreen), though I wasn't so crazy about the use of 3-D with the picture: more often than not it dims the movie's vivid cinematography, offering only occasional ""depth of field"" type of effects that are really noticeable. The DTS MA sound is strong on all the renditions, while extras include 24 minutes of deleted scenes (some of which would've helped the pacing) in HD, brief featurettes (there's a Patrick Doyle interview that runs barely two minutes), a commentary from Branagh and some connecting featurettes designed to sell ""The Avengers,"" though little in the way of footage from the much-anticipated super-hero match-up.",4,"One of the Best Marvel Films, Though Not an ""Essential"" 3-D Purchase",1337040000,"05 15, 2012",2012,3093,"['THOR', 'what', 'idea', 'what', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'big', 'colorful', 'loud', 'little', 'bit', 'corny', 'times', 'hugely', 'entertaining', 'throughout.Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'unabashedly', 'colorful', 'fun', 'take', 'material', 'memorable', 'production', 'design', 'Bo', 'Welch', 'sets', 'costumes', 'look', 'just', 'flew', 'off', 'Marvel', 'pages', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'anything', 'Asgard', 'scenes', 'Flash', 'Gordon', 'plenty', 'rousing', 'action', 'match.Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'undeniably', 'charismatic', 'Odin', 'son', 'who', 'banished', 'Earth', 'father', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'putting', 'kingdom', 'Asgard', 'trouble', 'callous', 'actions', 'other', 'pre-fab', 'Aussie', 'leading', 'men', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'late', 'Sam', 'Worthington', 'anyone', 'Hemsworth', 'real', 'deal', 'effortlessly', 'navigating', 'way', 'material', 'right', 'dash', 'arrogance', 'empathy', 'many', 'Marvel', 'films', 'ultimately', 'moral', 'story', 'Action', 'humor', 'fantasy', 'come', 'together', 'Thor', 'mere', 'mortal', 'grad', 'student', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'appealing', 'was', 'Star', 'Wars', 'prequels', 'who', 'infatuated', 'muscle-bound', 'hero', 'Hopkins', ""n't"", 'just', 'cash', 'check', 'Odin', 'other', 'roles', 'are', 'satisfyingly', 'filled', 'likes', 'Stellan', 'Skaarsgard', 'Portman', 'professor', 'boss', 'Kat', 'Dennings', 'friend', 'Idris', 'Elba', 'Asgard', 'gatekeeper', 'Tom', 'Hiddelston', 'Loki', 'Thor', 'troubled', 'brother', 'who', ""'re"", 'see', 'good', 'deal', 'more', 'next', 'summer', 'Avengers', 'Speaking', 'much-anticipated', 'super-hero', 'team', 'mash-up', 'lead-in', 'material', 'picture', 'incorporated', 'story', 'here', 'far', 'more', 'organically', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'Hawkeye', 'very', 'brief', 'appearance', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'sitting', 'there', 'thinking', 'movie', 'stopped', 'dead', 'incorporate', 'references', 'Avengers', 'pacing', 'little', 'bit', 'odd', 'times', 'movie', 'Asgard', 'Earth', 'sequences', 'anything', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'more', 'character', 'development', 'cut', 'lean', '2', 'hours', 'overall', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'entertained', 'colorful', 'romantic', 'genre', 'entertainment', 'dynamic', 'Patrick', 'Doyle', 'score', 'most', 'satisfying', 'work', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'composer', 'Halcyon', 'days', 'mid', '90s.Paramount', 'brought', 'Thor', 'BD', 'number', 'different', 'flavors', 'including', 'Blu-Ray/3-D', 'Blu-Ray/DVD', 'copy', 'HD', 'image', 'Blu-Ray', 'expectedly', 'strong', '1080p', 'AVC', 'encoded', 'widescreen', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'crazy', 'use', '3-D', 'picture', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'movie', 'vivid', 'cinematography', 'offering', 'only', 'occasional', 'depth', 'field', 'type', 'effects', 'are', 'really', 'noticeable', 'DTS', 'MA', 'sound', 'strong', 'renditions', 'extras', 'include', '24', 'minutes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'would', ""'ve"", 'helped', 'pacing', 'HD', 'brief', 'featurettes', 'Patrick', 'Doyle', 'interview', 'barely', 'two', 'minutes', 'commentary', 'Branagh', 'connecting', 'featurettes', 'designed', 'sell', 'Avengers', 'little', 'way', 'footage', 'much-anticipated', 'super-hero', 'match-up']",N/A

To me how a villan became corrupt is just as interesting as how a hero became a hero.I loved how both brothers started out as equals striving to become king. One was conceited and reckless while the other mischevious but otherwise honorable. While Thor had to learn humility and his rightful place, Loki had to contend with the fact that he had been lied to as a child and was never going to be equal with his brother.Tom Hiddleston who played the character of Loki was very good at portraying the complex emotions of this intriging villan.Over all I didn't love this movie, but I did like it.

Thor is my favorite comic book character, so I couldn't wait to see him on the big screen. There were some worries though. Most modern adaptations of Thor weren't treated with much respect or dignity. I'm happy to say all my worries were quickly erased.Like others have said, Thor is easily one of the toughest heroes to adapt onscreen. Thor is a hero who navigates between two connected, but different worlds. I thought the writers did a brilliant job all-around though. Thor has often been shown as a fish-out-of-water on earth, but I thought he adapted and fit-in well on earth here.This isn't a true origins films as most comic book films usually are. Thors' early life is mostly grossed over, which is probably good. Probably take too much time to tell anyway. The early, but short battle between Asgard and the Frost Giants had me mesmerized from the beginnng.  And as a unapologetic fan of action films and/or sequences, I've got to say by action expectations were easily filled. Thor managed to get about 5-6 action sequences into a fairly complex storyline.The story was quite complex but very good overall. Great casting choices all-around. Great villian in Loki. Much better than I expected actually. Always thought he was one-note in the comics, but the actor really fleshed him out. Our hero Thor was played beautifully I thought. Made me proud to be a Thor fan. Odin was just as regal and imposing as I've always envisioned him. Much respect to Sir Anthony Hopkins! Now I can sometimes do without the love interest aspects of these films, but I gotta say Natalie Portman as Jane, was very much appreciated and welcomed by me. She did a great job, plus I think she's kind of hot. Loved the Warriors Three, and especially loved the awesome and baeutiful warrior Lady Sif. Hope to see more of Sif in the sequels. Also enjoyed Thors' other earthly friendly, especially the one with Norway roots.No complaints here at all. Well other than it being in 3D. Just felt the 3D wasn't needed, plus I never liked it. Others seem to like the 3D just fine though. I was thoroughly entertained by this film, and would have probably seen it 5 times if it wasn't in 3D. Can't wait until this gets released on blu-ray and dvd, and especially can't wait until the sequel comes out.",5,Truly Great!,1308096000,"06 15, 2011",2011,2349,"['comic', 'book', 'adaptations', 'made', 'Thor', 'was', 'easily', 'most', 'awaited', 'Thor', 'favorite', 'comic', 'book', 'character', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'big', 'screen', 'were', 'worries', 'Most', 'modern', 'adaptations', 'Thor', 'were', ""n't"", 'treated', 'much', 'respect', 'dignity', ""'m"", 'happy', 'say', 'worries', 'were', 'quickly', 'erased.Like', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'Thor', 'easily', 'one', 'toughest', 'heroes', 'adapt', 'onscreen', 'Thor', 'hero', 'who', 'two', 'connected', 'different', 'worlds', 'thought', 'writers', 'did', 'brilliant', 'job', 'all-around', 'Thor', 'often', 'been', 'shown', 'fish-out-of-water', 'earth', 'thought', 'adapted', 'fit-in', 'well', 'earth', 'here.This', ""n't"", 'true', 'films', 'most', 'comic', 'book', 'films', 'usually', 'are', 'Thors', 'early', 'life', 'mostly', 'grossed', 'probably', 'good', 'Probably', 'take', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'tell', 'anyway', 'early', 'short', 'battle', 'Asgard', 'Frost', 'Giants', 'had', 'mesmerized', 'beginnng', 'unapologetic', 'fan', 'action', 'films', 'and/or', 'sequences', ""'ve"", 'got', 'say', 'action', 'expectations', 'were', 'easily', 'filled', 'Thor', 'managed', 'get', '5-6', 'action', 'sequences', 'fairly', 'complex', 'storyline.The', 'story', 'was', 'quite', 'complex', 'very', 'good', 'overall', 'Great', 'casting', 'choices', 'all-around', 'Great', 'villian', 'Loki', 'Much', 'better', 'expected', 'actually', 'Always', 'thought', 'was', 'one-note', 'comics', 'actor', 'really', 'fleshed', 'out', 'hero', 'Thor', 'was', 'played', 'beautifully', 'thought', 'Made', 'proud', 'be', 'Thor', 'fan', 'Odin', 'was', 'just', 'regal', 'imposing', ""'ve"", 'always', 'envisioned', 'Much', 'respect', 'Sir', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Now', 'can', 'sometimes', 'do', 'love', 'interest', 'aspects', 'films', 'got', 'ta', 'say', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'Jane', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'appreciated', 'welcomed', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'think', 'kind', 'hot', 'Loved', 'Warriors', 'Three', 'especially', 'loved', 'awesome', 'baeutiful', 'warrior', 'Lady', 'Sif', 'Hope', 'see', 'more', 'Sif', 'sequels', 'Also', 'enjoyed', 'Thors', 'other', 'earthly', 'friendly', 'especially', 'one', 'Norway', 'roots.No', 'complaints', 'here', 'Well', 'other', 'being', '3D', 'Just', 'felt', '3D', 'was', ""n't"", 'needed', 'never', 'liked', 'Others', 'seem', 'like', '3D', 'just', 'fine', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'entertained', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'probably', 'seen', '5', 'times', 'was', ""n't"", '3D', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'released', 'blu-ray', 'dvd', 'especially', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'sequel', 'out']",N/A

1324449,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B0034G4P80,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[3, 4]","In the realm of Asgard dwell a race of aliens who inspired the Norse myths. A millennia ago, they fought a war against the frost giants, defeating them and forging an uneasy peace. When a frost giant raiding party attacks Asgard, Odin dismisses it as a one-off incident whilst his son Thor demands a warrior's response. When he disobeys his father's command and launches a counter-raid on the frost giant homeworld, Thor is stripped of his powers and exiled to Earth, leaving his brother Loki free to rise to power in Asgard...Of the Marvel superheroes headed for the big screen, Thor was always going to be the hardest sell. Whilst the other Marvel heroes are (mostly) humans who have gained their power through science, technology or mutations, Thor is an alien from another world who dresses up like a Lord of the Rings character, intones rather than speaks and whose answer to everything is overwhelming violence. Marvel made an excellent choice in bringing in Kenneth Branagh to direct the movie. A Shakespeare actor and director of long standing, Branagh embraces the movie's crazy concepts and over-the-top theatrics with all the relish of a director jumping head-first into A Midsummer Night's Dream and brings real flair to many of the scenes. Most notably, he does not balk with either the action sequences or the CGI-heavy scenes and pulls these off well.The movie's depiction of Asgard is a notable part of its success, with the realm depicted as a colourful and weird world of retrofuturistic buildings, rainbow bridges and people who have never heard the word 'camp' walking about in gleaming golden armour. The casting of its residents helps a lot with this, with Sir Anthony Hopkins bringing requisite gravitas to the role of Odin and Chris Hemsworth making for a likable Thor. Tom Hiddleston is excellent in the role of Loki, bringing charisma to what could have been a one-note villain. Idris Elba also does great work in the very small (but crucial) role of Heimdall. As well as having the most ludicrous costume in the film (this is saying a lot) and some of the most portentous dialogue, he is also saddled with dubious contact lenses, but is never less than 100% convincing in the role. Thor's band of adventuring companions is well-played (and it's always great to see Ray 'THIRTEEN!' Stevenson on screen) but under-used. Similarly under-utilised is Colm Feore as the king of the frost giants, who is appropriately menacing but barely appears.For the Earth characters, Natalie Portman is also solid as Jane Foster, but her character lacks real development in the film. In fact, she degrades from an intelligent physicist into a two-dimensional love interest over its length, which is disappointing. Outside of a few decent one-liners, Kat Dennings also gets little to do as Darcy Lewis, to the point where she seems to have no point in the movie. Stellan Skarsgard is better-served as Eric Selvig (rather better than Portman, as he carries over to The Avengers) who gets a few good scenes, most notably when he and Thor get drunk in a bar. Most surprising is Jeremy Renner, who unexpectedly shows up for five minutes as an archer and then vanishes, which will likely confuse casual audiences but delight hardcore Marvel fans (as will Clark Gregg, returning from the Iron Man movies as Agent Phil Coulson).The film ticks along nicely with some good pacing, and the script does a good job of mixing up the Marvel universe and Norse mythology whilst trying to anchor the Earth scenes in some kind of reality. Considering the potential for the movie degenerating into a confused mess, it's impressive it turned out as cohesive as it has. Unfortunately, there are some issues. Thor losing his powers so he is actually in danger on Earth is a lazy plot device, whilst the Destroyer is not a particularly engaging enemy. There's also a dearth of good female roles, with Portman's role being predictable and Dennings's being pointless. Jaimie Alexander is better-served as Sif, but is still relegated to the supporting cast. The script also arguably does not adequately explain why Thor offers to ally with SHIELD, given that SHIELD's portrayal for most of the movie is not particularly flattering.Still, Thor (***) is enjoyable in a gloriously over-the-top, bonkers way. Some underserved actors and dubious plot points notwithstanding, it's a reasonable slice of entertainment. The movie is available now in the UK (DVD, Blu-Ray) and USA (DVD, Blu-Ray).",4,Enjoyable as it embraces the silliness of the concept,1336003200,"05 3, 2012",2012,4469,"['realm', 'Asgard', 'dwell', 'race', 'aliens', 'who', 'inspired', 'Norse', 'myths', 'millennia', 'ago', 'fought', 'war', 'frost', 'giants', 'defeating', 'forging', 'uneasy', 'peace', 'When', 'frost', 'giant', 'raiding', 'party', 'attacks', 'Asgard', 'Odin', 'one-off', 'incident', 'whilst', 'son', 'Thor', 'warrior', 'response', 'When', 'disobeys', 'father', 'command', 'counter-raid', 'frost', 'giant', 'homeworld', 'Thor', 'stripped', 'powers', 'exiled', 'Earth', 'leaving', 'brother', 'Loki', 'free', 'rise', 'power', 'Asgard', 'Marvel', 'superheroes', 'headed', 'big', 'screen', 'Thor', 'was', 'always', 'going', 'be', 'hardest', 'sell', 'Whilst', 'other', 'Marvel', 'heroes', 'are', 'mostly', 'humans', 'who', 'have', 'gained', 'power', 'science', 'technology', 'mutations', 'Thor', 'alien', 'world', 'who', 'up', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'character', 'rather', 'speaks', 'answer', 'everything', 'overwhelming', 'violence', 'Marvel', 'made', 'excellent', 'choice', 'bringing', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'direct', 'movie', 'Shakespeare', 'actor', 'director', 'long', 'standing', 'Branagh', 'movie', 'crazy', 'concepts', 'over-the-top', 'theatrics', 'relish', 'director', 'jumping', 'head-first', 'Midsummer', 'Night', 'Dream', 'brings', 'real', 'flair', 'many', 'scenes', 'Most', 'notably', 'not', 'balk', 'action', 'sequences', 'CGI-heavy', 'scenes', 'pulls', 'well.The', 'movie', 'depiction', 'Asgard', 'notable', 'part', 'success', 'realm', 'depicted', 'colourful', 'weird', 'world', 'retrofuturistic', 'buildings', 'rainbow', 'bridges', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'word', ""'camp"", 'walking', 'gleaming', 'golden', 'armour', 'casting', 'residents', 'lot', 'Sir', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'bringing', 'requisite', 'gravitas', 'role', 'Odin', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'making', 'likable', 'Thor', 'Tom', 'Hiddleston', 'excellent', 'role', 'Loki', 'bringing', 'charisma', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'one-note', 'villain', 'Idris', 'Elba', 'also', 'great', 'work', 'very', 'small', 'crucial', 'role', 'Heimdall', 'As', 'well', 'having', 'most', 'ludicrous', 'costume', 'film', 'saying', 'lot', 'most', 'portentous', 'dialogue', 'also', 'saddled', 'dubious', 'contact', 'lenses', 'never', 'less', '100', '%', 'convincing', 'role', 'Thor', 'band', 'adventuring', 'companions', 'well-played', 'always', 'great', 'see', 'Ray', 'Stevenson', 'screen', 'under-used', 'Similarly', 'under-utilised', 'Colm', 'Feore', 'king', 'frost', 'giants', 'who', 'appropriately', 'menacing', 'barely', 'Earth', 'characters', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'also', 'solid', 'Jane', 'Foster', 'character', 'lacks', 'real', 'development', 'film', 'fact', 'intelligent', 'physicist', 'two-dimensional', 'love', 'interest', 'length', 'disappointing', 'few', 'decent', 'one-liners', 'Kat', 'Dennings', 'also', 'little', 'do', 'Darcy', 'Lewis', 'point', 'where', 'have', 'point', 'movie', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgard', 'better-served', 'Eric', 'Selvig', 'rather', 'better', 'Portman', 'Avengers', 'who', 'few', 'good', 'scenes', 'most', 'notably', 'when', 'Thor', 'get', 'drunk', 'bar', 'Most', 'surprising', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'who', 'unexpectedly', 'up', 'five', 'minutes', 'archer', 'then', 'vanishes', 'will', 'likely', 'confuse', 'casual', 'audiences', 'delight', 'hardcore', 'Marvel', 'fans', 'will', 'Clark', 'Gregg', 'returning', 'Iron', 'Man', 'movies', 'Agent', 'Phil', 'Coulson', '.The', 'film', 'ticks', 'nicely', 'good', 'pacing', 'script', 'good', 'job', 'mixing', 'up', 'Marvel', 'universe', 'Norse', 'mythology', 'whilst', 'trying', 'anchor', 'Earth', 'scenes', 'kind', 'reality', 'Considering', 'potential', 'movie', 'degenerating', 'confused', 'mess', 'impressive', 'turned', 'out', 'as', 'cohesive', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'issues', 'Thor', 'losing', 'powers', 'so', 'actually', 'danger', 'Earth', 'lazy', 'plot', 'device', 'whilst', 'Destroyer', 'not', 'particularly', 'engaging', 'enemy', 'also', 'dearth', 'good', 'female', 'roles', 'Portman', 'role', 'being', 'predictable', 'Dennings', 'being', 'pointless', 'Jaimie', 'Alexander', 'better-served', 'Sif', 'still', 'relegated', 'supporting', 'cast', 'script', 'also', 'arguably', 'not', 'adequately', 'explain', 'why', 'Thor', 'ally', 'SHIELD', 'given', 'SHIELD', 'portrayal', 'most', 'movie', 'not', 'particularly', 'flattering.Still', 'Thor', '***', 'enjoyable', 'gloriously', 'over-the-top', 'bonkers', 'way', 'underserved', 'actors', 'dubious', 'plot', 'points', 'notwithstanding', 'reasonable', 'slice', 'entertainment', 'movie', 'available', 'now', 'UK', 'DVD', 'Blu-Ray', 'USA', 'DVD', 'Blu-Ray']",N/A
1324450,A1DZU4AQR7KD9R,B0034G4P80,"Axton Blessendon, Jr.","[1, 1]","I liked this one. It's one of a handful (so far) of superhero/comicbook adaptations that are actually good. This origin story for Marvel Comics' ""Mighty Thor"" has a decent script, good special effects and a simple story arc, with a beginning, middle and end that (hooray!!!) doesn't try to pack too much into one movie. We meet our hero, he faces difficulties, discovers who the enemy is, and defeats them, with modest character growth along the way. Although the bad guy is beaten, they aren't explicitly killed right off the bat (as in so many other super-movies) and by an large the original Thor scenario is preserved from the comic book format.There is some minor tweaking of the Thor and Jane Foster characters (he's not stuck magically switching bodies between the disabled, mortal Donald Blake, and she's a feisty modern career gal, not a wimpy, lovelorn nurse) and although I didn't sense tremendous chemistry between the lead actors, I'm okay with the retconning of their characters: the old '60s soap opera was one of the elements that made the original ""Thor"" comic a bit dull. This is a welcome change of pace.Most of all, I appreciate the simplicity of the script, as well as the genuine humorous beats and groovy special effects. I also like that this is a superhero movie that was consciously made to link into another film (""The Avengers"") later on, with plot continuity and room to leave a few loose ends dangling. What kills all the other super-movies is the perverse urge to cram everything in all at once - tell you too much and kill off major bad guys in order to give us a big Hollywood ending. We don't want that: we want The Joker and Loki and Magneto to come back a bunch of times and make life miserable for our heroes. That's how these things work. And, that's what they did in this ""Thor"" film. Kudos. Hope they can get Kenneth Branagh and his crew on board for the sequel or sequels. They did good.

I've corrupted her into a geek pretty much, and so she was all about seeing Thor on the big screen. What a film! When kenneth Branagh was picked as director I said ""Well of course he is!"" His Shakespearean background would be perfect for the Asgardian God and his realm! I must say I'm glad I was very right! This is a very good movie, and adds to the Avengers stable of chracters with true Godly power. Hemsworth nails the part as Thor, and Hiddleston's Loki is suitably devious, but here we actually see why and it all works very organically. Hopkins as Odin the Allfather was absolutely brilliant. The film moves along a a good pace, and though it slows down a little in the middle it does pick up again at the end. i would say that's my one gripe. After the opening battle scene with the Frost Giants, the other action set-pieces just don't feel as strong. That said it's still a great film and worth the purchase. Also the Marvel One-shot ""The Consultant"" starring everyone's other favorite S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Coulson, who is featured in Thor as well, is worth the purchase too.

Odin is about to name the next king of Asgard, grooming both Thor and Loki to princely duties, but Loki's little prank goes awry when the Frost giants raid the treasury to try to retake the Casket of Winters. They are destroyed, and Odin is willing to dismiss it, but Thor is not, and leads a raid to Jotunheim to seek revenge, against his father's wishes. It is through Odin's intersession that the battle ends, but not amiably as King Laufy chooses to declare war on Asgard. It is in this battle that Loki learns his true heritage, that he is the son of King Laufy, discarded by Laufy, found by Odin and raised in Asgard.  . Because Thor in his arrogance, disobeyed him, he stripped him of his power and cast him from Asgard, until either he, or someone else can prove worthy to use Mjolnir,the magic hammer. Loki, in the meantime, demands to know more about how he came to be, and because Odin did not choose him to be the king, and Laufy discarded him,decides to take vengeance on both Laufey and Odin when Odin takes ill and falls into an enchanted sleep. Since Odin is asleep, Loki assumes the throne and leads the way for Laufey so that he may at last kill Odin while he is helpless. Thor on the other hand has problems of his own. Slamming into Midgard from above, he is anything but subtle. Taken to a hospital, he proves to be anything but the ideal patient and it is only through Jane Foster and her father that he manages to settle down so that he can try to find his hammer. He finds it, but so have others and SHIELD has surrounded it and taken all the scientific handiwork that Jane and her father had. It is when he fails to lift his hammer does he realize the truth. He must prove himself worthy once again or he will remain forever earthbound.

From then on it dropped downhill, but with enough great settings and special effects, that it does excite.What I give the most praise to in this film is Director Kenneth Branagh. His camera angles and the upside down views were interesting and depicted the separation of worlds. And the look of Asgard, as a city, was well crafted and beautifully rendered by the effects team. It was straight from the comics and done excellently on screen. The Gatekeeper was a great addition, I was glad he was in the film. Anthony Hopkins(""Silence Of The Lambs""), plays a good Odin and Chris Hemsworth is the perfect actor as the god of thunder. Loki is also an exciting character, his wickedness shows well here as performed by the great Tom Hiddleston.

After a while and because of the turn in story, you don't really think about those amazing effects, and that's a good thing. Instead, you're pulled into a story about people and that's a great thing.I like this comicbook anti-hero fallen god.  He's gritty, primal, vain yet noble and somehow more real. The film does a great job of showing us how an arrogant son can come to grips with who and what he truly is. The movie draws the audience in with its confidence and it never lets you go. There's no doubt that Natalie Portman was an important piece of casting because she brings the story down to earth. Thor meets Portman's Jane Foster after he is banished from the home of the gods to live among mortals. The audience can relate to what Jane is experiencing and it grounds the film perfectly. That makes the action seem more real and that's a tough balancing act. There are plenty of scenes that you have to see to believe!  This movie actually has a heart and a soul and a brain and I couldn't have asked for anything more.I'd rather a movie be too cerebral then too dumb.  This film succeeds on a basic level. It jumps the boundaries of its genre to pull in viewers with originality and inventiveness. Calling it a standard action film doesn't do it justice.

Erland,"[2, 4]","Thor was one of my favorite Marvel comic superheroes growing up so the release of the 2011 film `Thor' was greeted by much long overdue enthusiasm.  While it didn't live up to all my pre-conceived expectations (whatever does?), I found it to be an overall satisfying viewing. ""Overall satisfying""..., what the heck does that mean? Kind of a wishy-washy endorsement but let me add that this was my first viewing assessment. Sometimes you instantly fall in love with a film (which wasn't the case here). However other times an initial lukewarm acceptance of a film may begin to become more fully appreciated several days later, which is exactly what happened to me with this movie.First Impression: I had been impressed by the visuals from the beginning, particularly the sequences in Asgard, Home of the Gods and the frozen world of the Frost Giants. I also thought Chris Hemsworth lived up to my mental image of the mighty Thor and Tom Hiddleston as Loki was absolutely amazing. However I found the storyline rather weak and a little bit to comic bookish, particularly the dialogue (imagine that, complaining about comic book dialogue in a film based on a comic!). There just didn't seem to be enough residual `food for thought' in the production to warrant more than one viewing.Change of Mind: For a movie I thought I was over and done with I surprisingly couldn't get it out of my mind. Images of Asgard, the Rainbow Bridge and the brash and unbridled Thor stayed with me, replaying random scenes from the film before my mind's eye.  By far the most powerful image of them all was the face of Loki. Those haunting eyes, that regal strut and the aura of impending chaos surrounding him was intoxicating. Wow, it took a while but I finally came to the realization that I really loved this film after all.

I am still pissed as all hell about the fact that when ""Follywood"" gets their hands on a comicbook character they think they can outdo the original writers, sorry ""Follywood"" big mistake, it ain't happenning.  Who say's ain't, ain't a word ohh yeah, english majors, but I digress.Part of the reason comics are so popular is that they are very well written and the people who read really don't want his or her characters to messed up via ""Follywood's screenwriters who think they are staying true to the characters or want to put their own spin on a great story. Thor was a great quick shot in to the world of one of Marvels most mistreated characters. We seem to always want to knock down or degrade our demigods, I'm not touching the real deal equation. The movie was definitely cool from a comic book fans perspective, even if there was no Donald Blake involved in the movie. Although his alter ego plays a very pivitol role in the comics until the year 2000,, and while Jane Foster was not a nurse all is forgiven. I came in to the movie not seeing a single trailer on purpose, as I have read and own about 75% of the Thor comics Marvel has produced. I have been reading them since he first ran in to the Hulk, back in Journey in to Mystery issue 112, and then I got in to Norse Mythology. So I am what Marvel would have called back then a ""True believer"" or Merry Marvel Madman.  I loved the visuals, the timing was almost flawless and for an actor who was pretty much unknown to most Americans I think he did a really good job, and as always I wanted most special effects , especially when it came to what the hammer is actually capable of doing. I would dare say, that I would like to see another Thor movie this time without  his half brother involved. But as most Most comic book fans of Thor know, that's almost impossible though, but Crusher Creel AKA ""The Absorbing Man"" would be a great nemesis for Thor as well as ""the Celestials"".

1324520,A1M39P7MO277FV,B0034G4P80,Chinmay Hota,"[3, 6]","You get a feeling sometimes, a feeling of hopelessness as summer comes along, the same old stuff in new package is in 3D, sometimes it explodes a lot, but most of the times it is, inevitably, crap. Talking about movies of course. And other times, you get a really good summer blockbuster. Thor belongs to the latter category.Summer blockbusters have traditionally been a money-fest, rushed 3D releases with lot of lacklustre performances and lots of explosions to keep the popcorn cracking. Very few directors try to take the next step in actually weaving in a good movie storyline or plot or inspire their actors to at least deliver their lines properly. Kenneth Branagh is one director who does all those things. And more.It seems Hollywood and comic-book movies have found their ticket to ultimate success. Hire an English director, get a non-American actor and make producers shell out lots and lots of money. But there is something different about Thor, making it unique from recent super-hero movies which have performed commendably. It is hard to point out that abstract something, so I will list all the good things about the movie and hopefully imbibe you with that intangible quality the movie possesses.Firstly, Asgard's design. We have come across many CGI landscapes and planets now, but nothing the computer animators have ever made (with an exception of Pandora) comes even close to Asgard's design. This is the ultimate fix for an escapism--junkee. I felt Asgard was a separate entity of the movie, in all its glory, shining like a beacon of hope for good movies. It looked so great that the scenes taking place in Midgard (Earth) felt like they were biting into the movie minutes, long minutes when they could have offered more of Asgard. One of the few things I'll ever criticise as ""There is just not enough of it"".Now the acting. Chris Hemsworth really brings the Norse God of Thunder into life and coats him with a sense of inexplicable charm. Every scene that he is in, especially the ones with the costume on, is transformed from mundane to exquisite art. Anthony Hopkins is the obvious highlight. I think I can safely say that calling the actor the highlight of a movie is like calling chicken the highlight of Chicken Steak. If there was ever an Odin, he was Anthony Hopkins. Tom Hiddleston completes the trio of awesomeness with his wit and talent as the mischievous Loki. At times, he felt like the main character of the movie.A minor gripe is that the supporting characters were not given enough highlight. Idris Elba brought his own as Heimdall, every delivery worth every cent I paid. I think Kat Dennings' lines were humourous, Skargard played an amazing character. Last but not the least, Natalie Portman, was good, but her talent felt a bit underused here. Sure, as the female lead in a pre-dominantly male super-hero movie, you don't get much focus, but she was a fresh Oscar winner, guys! Give her emotional lines!Lastly the direction. This is where it gets fun. Mr. Branagh is director of Shakespearean plays. If any director, after seeing this movies says ""This is exactly how I would have done"", I would say ""Don't kid yourself"". Branagh is the next Nolan and that is saying something. Converting the well-set movie universe with down-to-earth scientific and technological aspects into one which had Thor, Odin and Asgard (gods and magic) was a Herculean task, as evidenced from the development hell the movie went through. I would say no-one was a better choice than Branagh, and I fear after making Thor, there is nowhere to go but down for Mr. Branagh. Prove me wrong, man! (Hopefully he does all the Thor movies).

The worst part was waiting for the blue ray to be released so I could watch it when ever I wanted. The casting was wonderful and it was like the characters jumped from the two dimentional comic to the big screen. Not only was the movie well scripted and cast, it also served as a life lesson of how one lives their life and how they can change for the better. This was a fine message for all ages.

Yes, Kenneth Branagh's super-hero epic has arrived, and it's... really quite good, actually, provided you just put your brain into neutral and let the sheer energy of it all roll over you.The story tells the tale of Thor (Chris Hemsworth, who is certainly not the worst-looking man ever filmed), a young Asgardian about to be made heir to the throne by his father, Odin (Anthony Hopkins). In the background his younger brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston, who looks very familiar despite my not having seen him in anything before), seethes with jealousy. During the ceremony to invest Thor with his titles, the Frost Giants attack, trying to steal a device that was taken from them after the last war between Jotunheim and Asgard. They're stopped, but Thor vows revenge. He rounds up his friends, crosses Bifrost, the Rainbow Bridge, and launches an ill-fated attack. In the end, war is declared and Odin, who had hoped to maintain peace, is forced to send his son into exile on Earth.Now that story alone could have made for an interesting film, but that's only the first act. After arriving on Earth, Thor meets up with an astrophysicist (Natale Portman, whose own scientific background lends her credibility to this role). He's lost his powers and lost his way. The two quickly bond and, well, you know where that's heading. Meantime, SHIELD is investigating a mysterious, unmovable hammer that seems to have dropped out of the sky and hit the ground hard in New Mexico...Like I said, I really enjoyed this movie. There's quite a lot of humor, lots of action and wonderful acting. Idris Elba, who plays Heimdal, is the real revelation here, as he does an exceptional job in what's really a fairly small role. The story also does an excellent job incorporating the various elements of Norse mythology. As both a super hero fan and a mythology fan, I really appreciated seeing the version of Asgard that was put up onto the screen.I must say, aside from some of the overall silliness of the story, I can't find much anything to complain about, though the movie seems to sort of just stop rather than actually end. It was wildly entertaining and the brief appearances by the likes of Hawkeye and Nick Fury, both of them there to help set up next year's Avengers film, were enough to make the fanboy in me make all sorts of happy noises.

1324543,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B0034G4P80,C. Sawin,"[13, 15]","Superhero films are pretty much guaranteed to make a killing at the box office. It's mostly due to high anticipation, but also due to the fact that most studios seem to have been able to iron out the kinks over the years which lead to most of these films doing their source material justice while also just being great films in general. It hasn't always been that way though. Elektra and Punisher: War Zone practically bombed while films like X-Men: The Last Stand and X-Men Origins: Wolverine resulted in more fans distancing themselves from the franchise rather than embracing it. With Marvel banking so much on The Avengers being not only a huge accumulation of characters that fans love but also an amazing assembly of talent, Thor is a film that pretty much had to be good to gain momentum for what was just over the horizon. Before I gave up being a full-time comic book nerd, I never really thought much of Thor. So I wasn't really sure what to expect going into this. I wasn't overly excited for the film even though it looked fairly incredible, but luckily Thor was able to offer a magnificent spectacle that all superhero films should strive to be.Thor still has that same atmosphere that any of the Marvel films since Iron Man have had, but at the same time seems to offer something that those films couldn't. A lot of it probably has to do with Asgard. This heavenly realm is unlike anything you've ever seen before and the special effects in the film are done well enough to be equally as impressive as Pandora in Avatar. Asgard is this spectacular kingdom in the sky that is incredibly extravagant and painted with gold. It's just breathtaking how well Thor was able to pull something like that off.The cast is really phenomenal, as well. Chris Hemsworth is a really solid choice for Thor. His height, his build, the way he carries himself, along with his facial expressions are just as vital to how Thor is portrayed as his appearance and his dialogue. Hemsworth nails it; all of it. Tom Hiddleston was also a scene stealer. Loki is a guy you know is up to no good right from the start, but Hiddleston portrays his underhanded deeds to perfection. Throw in the intensity he utilizes in the second half of the film and Loki turns out to be a villain you're going to crave to see more of. Anthony Hopkins deserves a mention, as well. Many of Hopkins' recent roles have been lacking that special something that made many of his most popular roles so great. He was a fantastic choice for Odin though. He reminds you why you considered him so talented in the first place. The only nitpick I have is that both Natalie Portman and Tadanobu Asano were a little disappointing and I was expecting more from them. Portman doesn't really do much besides look pretty and Tadanobu's Hogun just deserved a little more screen time. I'm a huge fan of just about every Tadanobu Asano film out there though, so that could just be the fanboy in me talking.Thor may be the loudest film I've ever seen in theaters. The film is mostly action to begin with, so it's guaranteed to be loud. But it just seemed louder than usual, especially any scene involving The Destroyer.  That's not a bad thing; not at all. I'd rather have a film be too loud than too quiet any day.Thor is an extravagant looking film dripping with spellbinding special effects, a fantastic cast overflowing with talent, and a captivating story that holds your interest from beginning to end. Thor has enough character development to introduce new characters while also leaving enough room to expand on their origins in the forthcoming sequels you'll be itching for by the time you see Thor swing Mjolnir for the last time. The superhero spectacular also offers a fair amount of heart amongst its waves of depth while also delivering incredibly loud and explosive action sequences. Words almost don't seem to do the film justice. Thor is imaginative, charming, and the definition of what an introductory superhero film should be. It could arguably be the best Marvel film to date.",5,Spectacular.

1324553,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B0034G4P80,DanD,"[1, 1]","With Kenneth Branagh at the helm, it's hard not to draw comparisons between THOR and various Shakespearean tragedies: brash, arrogant son defies his father, bringing about apocalyptic consequences, only to find that he was betrayed by those whom he trusted most.  It's an age-old story, which works in THOR's favor: it lends the film a firm sense of ethos, a grand backdrop which Branagh manipulates with great skill.It helps that he's chosen a fine cast.  Chris Hemsworth has solid screen presence; the film sags a bit when Thor loses his powers, but picks up admirably when he regains them.  Throughout, Hemsworth remains, at his worst, watchable, and at his best, thoroughly engaging.  As the devious Loki, Tom Hiddleston is a devious, manipulating wonder (stick around after the credits for what is arguably his best scene).  Anthony Hopkins finally has a role he can sink his teeth into again, and Stellan Skarsgard scores as a doubtful scientist.  Natlie Portman doesn't have a whole lot to do, but she does it well; same with Kat Dennings, who provides some of the film's necessary comic relief.  Clark Gregg is back as smarmy Agent Coulson, and Idris Elba has a grand bit part as a loyal gatekeeper.  Also look for: Ray Stevenson as a Norse warrior; Rene Russo as Thor's mother; Colm Feore as a menacing Ice Giant king; and Jeremy Renner in a thoroughly bada** cameo.THOR definitely has its flaws, number one being its utter implausibility.  It's hard to bring the mystical wonder of comic books to the big screen; comic fans are much more willing to suspend disbelief than the average film-goer (though the popularity of such films as TWILIGHT and the TRANSFORMERS franchise says otherwise...).  Branagh doesn't try to convince us that all this is real; that tactic works great with heroes such as Batman, but when you're dealing with the Norse god of thunder, it's best to just shrug it off by having your hero declare: ""Your ancestors called it magic; you call it science.  Where I come from, they're one and the same.""  Branagh goes for the implausible epic; he doesn't succeed (to keep audiences interested, the film has to clock in under 2 hours, and it's hard to do an epic is such a short time), but it's a noble effort, and makes for one of the more entertaining superhero movies of late.  Not quite as good as IRON MAN, say, but a few steps above IRON MAN 2 or THE GREEN LANTERN.  It's refreshing to see a comic book film that isn't an origin story, or doesn't try to rewrite ""history.""  It's simply a straightforward film, featuring a solid cast, helmed by a reliable filmmaker.  If that's what you're in the mood for, it doesn't get much better than THOR.",4,A good old-fashioned action epic.,1316304000,"09 18, 2011",2011,2675,"['Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'helm', 'hard', 'not', 'draw', 'comparisons', 'THOR', 'various', 'Shakespearean', 'tragedies', 'brash', 'arrogant', 'son', 'father', 'bringing', 'apocalyptic', 'consequences', 'only', 'find', 'was', 'betrayed', 'whom', 'trusted', 'most', 'age-old', 'story', 'THOR', 'favor', 'film', 'firm', 'sense', 'ethos', 'grand', 'backdrop', 'Branagh', 'great', 'skill.It', 'chosen', 'fine', 'cast', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'solid', 'screen', 'presence', 'film', 'bit', 'when', 'Thor', 'powers', 'up', 'admirably', 'when', 'Throughout', 'Hemsworth', 'worst', 'watchable', 'best', 'thoroughly', 'engaging', 'devious', 'Loki', 'Tom', 'Hiddleston', 'devious', 'manipulating', 'wonder', 'stick', 'around', 'credits', 'what', 'arguably', 'best', 'scene', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'finally', 'role', 'can', 'sink', 'teeth', 'again', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgard', 'doubtful', 'scientist', 'Natlie', 'Portman', ""n't"", 'have', 'whole', 'lot', 'do', 'well', 'same', 'Kat', 'Dennings', 'who', 'film', 'necessary', 'comic', 'relief', 'Clark', 'Gregg', 'back', 'smarmy', 'Agent', 'Coulson', 'Idris', 'Elba', 'grand', 'bit', 'part', 'loyal', 'gatekeeper', 'Also', 'look', 'Ray', 'Stevenson', 'Norse', 'warrior', 'Rene', 'Russo', 'Thor', 'mother', 'Colm', 'Feore', 'menacing', 'Ice', 'Giant', 'king', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'thoroughly', 'bada**', 'cameo.THOR', 'definitely', 'flaws', 'number', 'one', 'being', 'utter', 'implausibility', 'hard', 'bring', 'mystical', 'wonder', 'comic', 'books', 'big', 'screen', 'comic', 'fans', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'willing', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'average', 'film-goer', 'popularity', 'such', 'films', 'TWILIGHT', 'TRANSFORMERS', 'franchise', 'otherwise', 'Branagh', ""n't"", 'try', 'convince', 'real', 'tactic', 'works', 'great', 'heroes', 'such', 'Batman', 'when', ""'re"", 'dealing', 'Norse', 'god', 'thunder', 'best', 'just', 'shrug', 'off', 'having', 'hero', 'declare', 'ancestors', 'called', 'call', 'science', 'Where', 'come', ""'re"", 'one', 'same', 'Branagh', 'implausible', 'epic', ""n't"", 'succeed', 'keep', 'audiences', 'interested', 'film', 'clock', '2', 'hours', 'hard', 'do', 'epic', 'such', 'short', 'time', 'noble', 'effort', 'one', 'more', 'entertaining', 'superhero', 'movies', 'late', 'Not', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'IRON', 'MAN', 'say', 'few', 'steps', 'IRON', 'MAN', '2', 'THE', 'GREEN', 'LANTERN', 'refreshing', 'see', 'comic', 'book', 'film', ""n't"", 'origin', 'story', ""n't"", 'try', 'rewrite', 'history', 'simply', 'straightforward', 'film', 'featuring', 'solid', 'cast', 'helmed', 'reliable', 'filmmaker', 'what', ""'re"", 'mood', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'better', 'THOR']",N/A

I have been a huge fan and collector of ""The Mighty Thor"" for many years. Being as such, I longed for the time that special effects would finally bring the odinson to life on the big screen. Anyway, here's my personal feelings towards a film that could have been a thousand times better than the tripe they gave us. Here we go..1) ""THE ICONIC BATTLE HELMET"". We're teased with it for less than a minute ~ on screen ~ then it simply vanishes, never to be seen or heard from again. Many don't really seem to care. Many still simple accept any bones tossed them. I, on the other hand, ""SAY THEE NAY""! Thor without that iconic helmet is like Superman without his cape, Batman without his ears, or Captain America without his mask. (*I'll save that last comparison for another review*)Anyway, that really ticked me off. Yet amother example of the directer being ashamed of the source material. It's a glaring fact, especially as a long-time fan ~ that continues to irritate me to no end.2) Loki is ""THE GOD OF EVIL"". What he ""IS NOT"" is a misunderstood villian (*alla Raimi's Doc Ock or Sandman*) who turns bad through contrived circumstances. Sometimes a villian should simply be born a villian. Loki and Thor have ""NEVER"" been anything but enemies. ""PERIOD""!3) Heimdel has always been a second banana in the books. Now all of a sudden he's as mighty as Odin himself??? Please. In addition to that, Heimdal's a Caucasian character in the books; not an African. However, what really bothered me with this one was the obvious. Now that they changed Heimdal to a black character, he also had to be at least as powerful as Odin. I found it rascially insecure and contrived. No one is as powerful as Odin in Asgard.4) I really wanted to see the transformation of Don Blake into Thor. I realize that Don Blake's been out of the comics for some time, but it would have been daring and a sight to see, adding so much more to the storyline. But oh yes, the filmmakers continue to be one dimensional thenmselves.5) Lady Siff and Thor are lovers in the books. In the film there was nothing. Having a love triangle with mortal Jane Foster and goddess; The Lady Siff would have been very intriguing, and again, added more to the story.6) Volstagg is one of my personal favorites in the comics. A great comedy relief and fun to watch. In the film he was ""BORING""!7) Has anyone seen or heard from ""BALDER THE BRAVE""?? He's only Thor's best friend and right-hand man. Alas, thanks to the people behind the Thor movie it's ""where's Waldo"" all over again.8) Lastly, the 3D sucked big time.Anyway, I'm sure to receive tons of hate mail on my review, but really don't care. The film sucked and I'm sorry I went to see it.P.S. Almost forgot.

I admit I didn&#8217;t know much about this character prior to seeing him in the movies, but my impression was most elements about him were very magical in nature. In the movies they use the famous science fiction trope of magic simply being sufficiently advanced technology. I think this was a wise decision as it better connects this character to the rest of the Marvel universe which has a much more science fiction feel (the Iron Man suit, gamma radiation and the Hulk, etc.) Rather than being a God from the fantasy world of Asgard, he is really more of an alien from another dimension.  Likewise, his powers and those of his adversaries are really examples of high technology, which to us mere mortals of Earth seem like magic.Chris Hemsworth was a perfect choice for the casting of Thor. Not only does he perfectly fill out the role of muscled Viking warrior, but he does a great job of taking the character from arrogance, to humility, and finally to redemption. The supporting cast likewise did an excellent job. The humorous moments provided a nice balance to the action and turmoil, without ever feeling campy.The story itself wasn&#8217;t quite as compelling as the first Iron Man, but was still a solid origin story and does a good job of setting up a lot of elements for the later movies (including the Avengers movie).",4,Walk tall and carry a big hammer,1384387200,"11 14, 2013",2013,1403,"['really', 'enjoy', 'how', 'Thor', 'character', 'was', 'adapted', 'big', 'screen', 'admit', 'didn', '8217', 'know', 'much', 'character', 'prior', 'seeing', 'movies', 'impression', 'was', 'most', 'elements', 'were', 'very', 'magical', 'nature', 'movies', 'use', 'famous', 'science', 'fiction', 'trope', 'magic', 'simply', 'being', 'sufficiently', 'advanced', 'technology', 'think', 'was', 'wise', 'decision', 'better', 'character', 'rest', 'Marvel', 'universe', 'much', 'more', 'science', 'fiction', 'feel', 'Iron', 'Man', 'suit', 'gamma', 'radiation', 'Hulk', 'etc', 'Rather', 'being', 'God', 'fantasy', 'world', 'Asgard', 'really', 'more', 'alien', 'dimension', 'Likewise', 'powers', 'adversaries', 'are', 'really', 'examples', 'high', 'technology', 'mere', 'mortals', 'Earth', 'seem', 'magic.Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'was', 'perfect', 'choice', 'casting', 'Thor', 'Not', 'only', 'perfectly', 'out', 'role', 'muscled', 'Viking', 'warrior', 'great', 'job', 'taking', 'character', 'arrogance', 'humility', 'finally', 'redemption', 'supporting', 'cast', 'likewise', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'humorous', 'moments', 'provided', 'nice', 'balance', 'action', 'turmoil', 'ever', 'feeling', 'campy.The', 'story', 'wasn', '8217', 'quite', 'as', 'compelling', 'first', 'Iron', 'Man', 'was', 'still', 'solid', 'origin', 'story', 'good', 'job', 'setting', 'up', 'lot', 'elements', 'later', 'movies', 'including', 'Avengers', 'movie']",N/A

Nick Fury gets a pass because he's black in the Ultimates, but older readers who haven't read a comic in decades would be annoyed by this. At least DC replaces a character who is white with a totally different character that is black. I know they did this to be politically correct, but could've used the black and asian actors to be Black Panther and Iron Fist, respectively. This movie doesn't beat the Iron Man franchise.

1324565,A3U7ELIED4WP4R,B0034G4P80,Dark Faerie Tales,"[2, 4]","The Review:The last several years have seen a renaissance of the superhero movie and there's never been a better time to be a comic book fanboy.  This is in no small part due to Marvel Studios pulling out all the stops in its efforts to bring its stellar list of heroes and rogues to the big screen.  Now it's Thor's turn and it lives up to the hype.  It brings a cosmic element to the Marvel films and conitinues setting the stage for next year's Avengers movie.  Thor is action packed, and has stellar performances that showcase a tremendously talented cast.Directed by Kenneth Brannaugh and starring Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Tom Hiddleston and Sir Anthony Hopkins, Thor overcame a lot of naysayers who questioned how Thor would fare on the big screen.  Marvel has tweeked and updated Thor's origins to better suit the 21st centrury audience. In the comics Thor is the Norse god of thunder who wields the magical hammer called Mjolnir.  In his movie incarnation, Thor and his fellow ""gods"" are actually super advanced beings, who as Thor explains, come from, Asgard, a place where science and magic are one and the same.  We mortals dwell in the realm of Midgard, one of the nine known realms.  The frost giants of Jutenheim have been at war with Asgard for a millenium.  That war occasionally spilled out to Midgard and the Asgardians led by Odin defended our primitive ancestors, who perceived the Asgardians as gods.In our time Thor Odinson is a brash young god, hier to the throne of Asgard.  He's Asgard's greatest warrior, but he is also arrogant and headstrong.  Thor's rash actions result in his banishment to Midgard, where he is powerless, but not helpless, while back home Thor's dysfunctional family is engaged in cosmic political intrigue with consequences on an interplanetary scale.  Fantastic special effects and art direction bring the story to life.  Besides its amazing action sequences, Thor succeeds in bringing Asgard, home of the gods to gleaming life.  Part of the set was on on display at the San Diego 2010 Comicon, which was impressive, but on the big screen it's truly unique and awesome.  When you see the halls of Asgard for the first time you will be suitably impressed.The film is split equally between the more cosmic settings of Asgard and Jutenheim and the more mundane Midgard.  I've seen some reviews that have taken issue with the lack of action in the more earthbound parts of the movie, and I could not disagree more as much of this is devoted to genuine character development.  Thor is not an ideal hero, and in true Marvel tradition he has his faults, which in his case, are arrogance and rushing into things with a disregard for the consequences of his actions.  Thor's actions while he's grounded on earth are some of the most entertaining parts of the movie.  It provides for some comic relief and genuinely funny moments as a six and a half foot god used to flying from place to place has to cope with hitching a ride like us mere mortals.Finally, the performances are worth a special mention.  The actors here all brought their A-game. Chris Hemsworth owns the role of Thor and is now as synonymous with this character as Robert Downey Jr. is with Tony Stark.

This is a fun action-packed superhero movie with a decent plot and wonderful writing.The special effects, especially the realm of Asgard, are extremely well done. While about the first half of the movie takes place there, most of the rest takes place on Earth, so it doesn't feel too alien or foreign. When Thor has his hammer he is virtually all-powerful and seems to derive joy from conflict. What makes his character so likable though is that he is fallible and despite some ego, he is humbled and learns from his mistakes. Of course, it doesn't hurt that he is also very handsome and chivalrous. Besides Thor and his brother Loki, the major characters include a couple human scientists, portrayed by Natalie Portman and Stellan Skarsgrd. Portman's character falls in love with Thor, while Skarsgrd's character is the overly protective father figure.While the effects are very good and the acting is great, what seemed to make the movie so enjoyable was the writing.

1324582,A2VN15501IUTND,B0034G4P80,"D. Christensen ""Jesus Freak""","[0, 1]","I'm a relative newcomer to Marvel movies, and the comic book media genre in general. I've always heard of all the different superheroes, both DC and Marvel, but none of them ever really appealed to me. When I was younger I would watch the old Superman cartoons from the 40s. They were okay, now they seem rather cheesy. I've still never read an actual comic book. I'm nowhere near being an expert on comic book lore, though Marvel Wiki and DC Universe Wiki have helped a lot. I just enjoy a good action movie. And that is exactly what Marvel Studios has done with their various outings based on different members of the Avengers team. I saw Captain America in the theater, mostly because my cousin thought it was great, and she took me to go see it. I fell in love. Then the Avengers came out. There was a ton of hype surrounding it, but I never saw it. Never really had the time, to be honest. Now that it's out on DVD I think I'll pick it up. But let's get to the point. In our home, my dad previews movies before he lets the rest of the family watch them. He finally got around to Thor when it showed up for free on Amazon Instant video. He said it was okay, so we watched it.I would love to call Thor a 5 star epic with no flaws, as I can say about Captain America. but simply put, there are some flaws. For one, the story has too many loose ends. I felt like the writers tried to go into too many different aspects of Thor's character and existence, and in the end they stretched themselves too thin, and basically ran out of time. I think what upset me the most was that they didn't go into the relationship of Jane and Thor enough. It was like, you never really knew what was going on between them until she randomly kisses him at the end. I felt like they spent way too much time with the drama in Asgard. They could have left out a lot of the scenes with Thor's crew of warriors, because they didn't add a whole lot to the story anyway. They could have shortened the first battle scene with the Frost Giants and the crew. I thought that they did an outstanding job on Loki, and it was interesting to watch because you never knew if he had good intentions or bad intentions, and you sort of felt sorry for him because I think he didn't even know whether he had good intentions or bad intentions. The action sequences were good, but I always felt like Thor was too good for everyone else and he was just kind of toying with them. Maybe that's how it is in the comics, but to me in this movie he seemed way too god-like. I realize he is a god, but they could have made some of the stuff a little more challenging for him. I also thought what was supposed to be the big final battle with the giant metal robot guy was a little lame. He comes in, destroys the town, kills a couple people, then Thor beats the snot out of him. I thought it was hard to understand exactly why certain things happened. Like, why was Thor exiled in the first place? Why did he go back to Asgard when the girl he loved couldn't go? Why didn't he take her with him? Why did he destroy the bridge? Why didn't he just go back to Earth when he was through with Loki? I just felt like a lot of this stuff could have been tightened up and explained better. I thought that the comedy relief aspect was dead on. This movie was a lot funnier than Captain America. I really liked how they portrayed his dealing with a different and totally foreign culture.

But you don't really know anything about Thor, except his has this creepy brother Loki, who has a back-story of his own.  Yawn.  After seeing Natalie Portman in ""Black Swan,"" it's hard to believe she could demean herself by being cast in this piece of fluff, and there is absolutely NO chemistry between her character and Thor.Now for the ""action,""--or lack thereof.  Thor has one major battle during the movie with some sort of guardian from Asgard.  That's it; there's nothing else.  You have his four bafoon friends who supposedly come to his aid.  If that's the best he can do, he needs to consider new friends.  They have no real ""character;"" they were simply dropped in the movie to take up space on the screen.  One-eyed Anthony Hopkins (Odin) talks a lot.  His scenes of ""sleeping"" were some of the best work he's done in a while.And now let's discuss this movie's rating:  PG-13 for ""intense science fiction violence.""

This movie, sadly, was nothing like them.  I was mostly bored, just waiting for something to happen.  There were a few halfway decent special effects (most notably the watcher at the gate, peering out eerily from behind his temporary prison of ice).  But the acting and the characters were completely one dimensional.  The blue villians hardly even had one dimension--they were like cardboard cutouts.  Their planet made no sense, and they seemed to have no purpose other than running out for Thor to beat up.  Loki almost had a little depth, but his story seemed to be half untold.

The result is an entertaining and eye-pleasing movie with just the right amounts of humor and gravitas, that moves easily between the otherworldly realm of Asgard and a dusty New Mexico town.As the story opens, the arrogant young warrior Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is banished from Asgard by his father, Odin (Anthony Hopkins), for restarting a war with the feared Frost Giants. Ambitious trickster brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is left behind to scheme for the throne.Thor, stripped of his godly powers, plummets to Earth and promptly collides (literally) with a group of off-beat astro-physicists led by Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and Dr. Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard). The movie milks some good humor from the resulting fish-out-of-water scenario without overdoing it.

1324632,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0034G4P80,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 3]","Among the Marvel Comics characters that have come to the silver screen, the biggest stretch to the imagination may be this elaborate 2011 fantasy adventure because the story is rooted in Norse mythology rather than technology and science fiction likeIron ManorSpider-Man. That's probably why producer Kevin Feige chose actor Kenneth Branagh to direct since his erudite touch, showcased in his numerous Shakespearean adaptations, is what the epic film needs to ground the more human elements into something more relatable to the audience. That's no small feat considering the amount of exposition needed at the beginning to give a brief history of Asgard where its king Odin has been waging war against the Frost Giants of Jotunheim led by their malevolent king Laufey. Odin has raised two sons, Thor and Loki, opposites in disposition as the arrogant Thor prepares to ascend the throne while Loki seethes in jealousy. Thor's fate is interrupted when the Frost Giants attempt to seize the Casket of Ancient Winters.Seeking revenge, Thor recruits his band of warriors to enter battle in Jotunheim, an act of defiance which causes Odin to banish Thor to Earth where he becomes mortal without his all-powerful hammer Mjolnir, which is stuck in a rock in the middle of the New Mexican desert. There he meets scientists Jane Foster and Erik Selvig and their assistant Darcy, where the movie diverges into a fish-out-of-water tale, while back in Asgard, Loki learns of his true identity as the son of Laufey and consequently attempts to take over the throne as Odin lies in a deep sleep. There are plenty of battle sequences to tie the story together and keep the momentum going, including an impressive, darkly lit fight with the Frost Giants and a classicHigh Noon-style confrontation with a nearly indestructible automaton. However, in the screenplay by Ashley Edward Miller, Zack Stentz and Don Payne, what really makes the movie great fun is its sense of humor during the New Mexico scenes, certainly enough to offset the more austere, good-versus-evil drama occurring back in Asgard.Ideally fitting the imposing physical dimensions of the title role, Australian actor Chris Hemsworth plays the stalwart, uncomplicated hero with aplomb. As Loki, Tom Hiddleston brings out the villain's veiled smarminess with ease. In danger of overexposure by now (this is the fourth movie of hers I've seen in four months), Natalie Portman manages to make the most of a wafer-thin role as the plucky Jane as we are meant to believe she is a master astrophysicist. Her comic interplay with Kat Demmings, amusingly acidic as ever as Darcy, provides nice relief from the action. Anthony Hopkins isn't really challenged much by the role of Odin, but he brings his trademark authority nonetheless. Idris Elba is hardly recognizable as a stoic sentry, while Rene Russo is given little to do as Odin's wife Frigga. As Selvig, Stellan Skarsgrd gets to play the unadventurous voice of reason on Earth, although he has an intriguing encounter with Samuel L. Jackson after the credits. All the production values and CGI effects are what you would expect from a $150 million film, and surprisingly, Branagh manages to tell the story in less time than ""Bridesmaids"".",4,"Combination of Norse Mythology, CGI Effects and Dry Humor Makes for a Comic Book Epic Worth a Look",1305590400,"05 17, 2011",2011,3236,"['Marvel', 'Comics', 'characters', 'have', 'come', 'silver', 'screen', 'biggest', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'may', 'be', 'elaborate', '2011', 'fantasy', 'adventure', 'story', 'rooted', 'Norse', 'mythology', 'rather', 'technology', 'science', 'fiction', 'likeIron', 'ManorSpider-Man', 'probably', 'why', 'producer', 'Kevin', 'Feige', 'chose', 'actor', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'direct', 'erudite', 'touch', 'showcased', 'numerous', 'Shakespearean', 'adaptations', 'what', 'epic', 'film', 'needs', 'ground', 'more', 'human', 'elements', 'something', 'more', 'relatable', 'audience', 'small', 'feat', 'considering', 'amount', 'exposition', 'needed', 'beginning', 'give', 'brief', 'history', 'Asgard', 'where', 'king', 'Odin', 'been', 'waging', 'war', 'Frost', 'Giants', 'Jotunheim', 'led', 'malevolent', 'king', 'Laufey', 'Odin', 'raised', 'two', 'sons', 'Thor', 'Loki', 'disposition', 'arrogant', 'Thor', 'prepares', 'ascend', 'throne', 'Loki', 'seethes', 'jealousy', 'Thor', 'fate', 'interrupted', 'when', 'Frost', 'Giants', 'attempt', 'seize', 'Casket', 'Ancient', 'Winters.Seeking', 'revenge', 'Thor', 'band', 'warriors', 'enter', 'battle', 'Jotunheim', 'act', 'defiance', 'Odin', 'banish', 'Thor', 'Earth', 'where', 'mortal', 'all-powerful', 'hammer', 'Mjolnir', 'stuck', 'rock', 'middle', 'New', 'Mexican', 'desert', 'scientists', 'Jane', 'Foster', 'Erik', 'Selvig', 'assistant', 'Darcy', 'where', 'movie', 'fish-out-of-water', 'tale', 'back', 'Asgard', 'Loki', 'true', 'identity', 'son', 'Laufey', 'consequently', 'attempts', 'take', 'over', 'throne', 'Odin', 'deep', 'sleep', 'are', 'plenty', 'battle', 'sequences', 'tie', 'story', 'together', 'keep', 'momentum', 'going', 'including', 'impressive', 'darkly', 'lit', 'fight', 'Frost', 'Giants', 'classicHigh', 'Noon-style', 'confrontation', 'nearly', 'indestructible', 'automaton', 'However', 'screenplay', 'Ashley', 'Edward', 'Miller', 'Zack', 'Stentz', 'Don', 'Payne', 'what', 'really', 'movie', 'great', 'fun', 'sense', 'humor', 'New', 'Mexico', 'scenes', 'certainly', 'enough', 'offset', 'more', 'austere', 'good-versus-evil', 'drama', 'occurring', 'back', 'Asgard.Ideally', 'fitting', 'imposing', 'physical', 'dimensions', 'title', 'role', 'Australian', 'actor', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'stalwart', 'uncomplicated', 'hero', 'aplomb', 'Loki', 'Tom', 'Hiddleston', 'out', 'villain', 'veiled', 'smarminess', 'ease', 'danger', 'overexposure', 'now', 'fourth', 'movie', 'hers', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'four', 'months', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'make', 'most', 'wafer-thin', 'role', 'plucky', 'Jane', 'are', 'meant', 'believe', 'master', 'astrophysicist', 'comic', 'interplay', 'Kat', 'Demmings', 'amusingly', 'acidic', 'as', 'ever', 'Darcy', 'nice', 'relief', 'action', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', ""n't"", 'really', 'challenged', 'much', 'role', 'Odin', 'trademark', 'authority', 'nonetheless', 'Idris', 'Elba', 'hardly', 'recognizable', 'stoic', 'sentry', 'Rene', 'Russo', 'given', 'little', 'do', 'Odin', 'wife', 'Frigga', 'Selvig', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgrd', 'play', 'unadventurous', 'voice', 'reason', 'Earth', 'intriguing', 'encounter', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'credits', 'production', 'values', 'CGI', 'effects', 'are', 'what', 'would', 'expect', '150', 'million', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'Branagh', 'tell', 'story', 'less', 'time', 'Bridesmaids']",N/A

Kenneth Brannagh) stars the beautifully stunning Aussie Chris Hemsworth in the title role (you may/may not recognize him from the latest STAR TREK movie as James Kirk's father, George).This was shot on location in Puente Antiguo, New Mexico - though an entire town was constructed for the film. As for the rest, I will not even begin to list the crazy trivia and insane backstory surrounding/pertaining to this film. In that list is everything from anecdotes about the agonizing over who would play Thor and Odin all the way to Stan Lee's de rigueur appearance in the film (he has said he always wanted to play Odin).Also I will not spoil a thing: the synopsis is Thor does something incredibly stupid and gets banished to Earth (no one ever says why Earth, but we can see why). There he gets thrown together with the charming duo of Natalie Portman and Stellan Skarsgrd as two astrophysicists. OK, so it smacked ofContact (Keepcase)but I see it as homage.What I will add is everyone seems to have a great deal of fun with this, especially Stellan Skarsgrd - but they work like crazy! Sir Anthony Hopkins gave such a moving, chilling and emotional performance in one scene that I not only wept, I've been trying to imitate that painful, roaring cadence of his voice ever since. (I'm told my voice and speech resemble his. But not in this great instance!) In an article somewhere, I read that Sir Anthony made the whole cast and crew weep during that scene. You'll know it when you see it!Director Brannagh, enthusiastic as hell apparently, did beautifully. He extracts Shakespeare-quality performances from everyone, and I mean everyone. This could have been yet another expensive joke, but Brannagh, Hopkins and Hemsworth - the trio sounding like a weird Dickensian law firm - really MADE this film.One major flaw: I think this is another of those damnable ""we'll-pick-this-up-again-in-two-to-three-years"" type of thing ... again! There are too many incomplete films this year and last year alone that are simply and badly unfinished. THOR is one of these and I regret it deeply. We have no guarantee of a sequel but I believe it is about 90% sure; probably 100% sure to be terrible (witness the grand difference betweenIron Man (Single-Disc Edition)andIron Man 2 (Single-Disc Edition)).In any case, this is a fun family film, plenty of grandiose CGI and stunning views of the cosmos to make it worthy ofThe Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (Special Extended Edition)AND comic book geeks everywhere.

I had to accept this movie on its own terms as a live action comic book that couldn't decide if it was meant to be funny or to be taken seriously.  It literally starts in the dark and stays there far longer than it should, even when one of the characters teases, ""wait for it.............""  I did.  What followed was a little fancy in the sky, a dust tornado, and the thud of Thor almost becoming road kill.  A bit of history was imparted in a grandiose manner.  Lots of CGI was employed (it seems these days that action films are becoming more animated than live action).  The plot involves two brothers born to be kings, but there can be only one!  One is arrogant (Thor), the other is just plain sneaky (Loki).  What follows is insubordination, insurrection, and expulsion to the planet Earth (the all-purpose penal colony for superheroes).  There's even a comparison to be had with The Sword in the Stone (who is worthy to wield the hammer of Thor!?).  Many pull but only one can master it.As far as action packed superhero flicks go, this one does what it's supposed to (which is neither faint praise nor vain glory).  No one really stood out.  The villain of the piece, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) was a bit wishy-washy.  Anthony Hopkins opted out for a snooze.

I have taken issue with story line deviations, when the movie alters what I consider to be a key element of the comic storyline. The whole Doctor Doom representation in the Fantastic Four movie for example. Hard to understand why they didn't stick with the original plot premise when the outcome was a less than stellar product. In Thor, however, they managed to balance this with staying true to the original. The outcome is an immersive movie experience that brings the Marvel universe to life in a more contemporary fashion. This movie succeeds on many levels and appeals to people familiar with comic book or those who are not. My wife loved the movie, yet has probably never even read a comic book. From the casting to the costuming to the acting to the scenery to the special effects here is a movie that stands up to repeated viewings. A great deal of credit has to go to the Director as well. One of the reasons this movie works so well is because it doesn't get bogged down with lengthy explanations but provides the viewer with enough background to make the story plausible and fast moving.

Fan of comics or no, the Norse mythology is in your face, and the world suffers not for the god's attentions. Despite the difference in themes and settings, you are caught in the epic-ness and are given just enough time to get carried away with it. And maybe a bit longer for you to enjoy an epic in a quiet New Mexican town.The characters and plot are point for point stories that have happened in the comics throughout the ages. Arrogant son defies father, younger brother manipulates the favoured son. The most amazing thing happens - it feels real.While we're along for the ride, the BD contains a number of featurettes from casting to props (esp. the Hammer), make-up, music (my least favourite aspect of the film) and settings. Unfortunately, this series of behind-the-scenes comes across a bit of a forced hand. Stan Lee is featured a bit in the featurettes, and that's awesome. He actually is shown walking and talking alongside the cast and crew. There is an Avengers teaser, which is not really anything special of any sorts. The deleted scenes are, for the most part, not deserving of the cut. The first of these is the best - featuring a close look at the brothers Thor and Loki and their close relationship. You get a real sense of camaraderie between Thor and his fellows (and Sif, too). Personally, I'd throw the lot of them back in the film and suffer the added length with a smile.Once again, I write this review as listening to the director commentary.

1324682,A1U6XPYATU9OPG,B0034G4P80,G. Denick,"[2, 3]","What I liked best about ""Thor"" was how the writers of the movie chose to approach the existence of these ""gods of Asgard"", treating them as extraterrestrials that the primitive cultures of Norway mistook for immortal deities. Therefore, the entirety of Norse mythology was created as a result of the visitations from these alien beings. As I'm not a huge comics fan, I'm not sure if this is consistent with canon of the comic book, or a deviation, but I think it was a really smart idea. Granted, the entire plot requires a massive suspension of disbelief... but if you can't do that, you probably shouldn't be watching a movie based on a comic book about Odin, Thor, and Loki ;)But with all the insane sci-fi and supernatural occurrences in this movie, the part that's the most difficult to swallow is how quickly Thor and Jane (Natalie Portman) fall in love. After just two days, they are HEAD OVER HEELS in love. I'm talking about ""I'll go the ends of the universe for you!"", tears-in-my-eyes, kind of love. Maybe if they were teenagers, but these are two grown adults! It's pretty silly, and I tease, but all kidding aside, the actor who plays Thor does a great job, and so does Natalie Portman. Also surprisingly good is Anthony Hopkins... I mean, I know he's a great actor, but to pull off the role of Odin? I should have known better than to doubt him JThis was a great movie for a Saturday night- fast, fun, boasting beautiful visuals (looks unreal on Blu-ray... especially the world of Asgard), and one of the better Marvel movies of the past few years.",5,"""Provide me with a dog or cat large enough that I can ride 50 miles west of here!"" -Thor",1329609600,"02 19, 2012",2012,1562,"['What', 'liked', 'best', 'Thor', 'was', 'how', 'writers', 'movie', 'chose', 'approach', 'existence', 'gods', 'Asgard', 'treating', 'extraterrestrials', 'primitive', 'cultures', 'Norway', 'mistook', 'immortal', 'deities', 'Therefore', 'entirety', 'Norse', 'mythology', 'was', 'created', 'result', 'visitations', 'alien', 'beings', ""'m"", 'not', 'huge', 'comics', 'fan', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'consistent', 'canon', 'comic', 'book', 'deviation', 'think', 'was', 'really', 'smart', 'idea', 'Granted', 'entire', 'plot', 'massive', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'probably', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'watching', 'movie', 'based', 'comic', 'book', 'Odin', 'Thor', 'Loki', 'insane', 'sci-fi', 'supernatural', 'occurrences', 'movie', 'part', 'most', 'difficult', 'swallow', 'how', 'quickly', 'Thor', 'Jane', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'fall', 'love', 'just', 'two', 'days', 'are', 'HEAD', 'OVER', 'HEELS', 'love', ""'m"", 'talking', ""'ll"", 'go', 'ends', 'universe', 'tears-in-my-eyes', 'kind', 'love', 'Maybe', 'were', 'teenagers', 'are', 'two', 'grown', 'adults', 'pretty', 'silly', 'tease', 'kidding', 'aside', 'actor', 'who', 'Thor', 'great', 'job', 'so', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'Also', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'mean', 'know', 'great', 'actor', 'pull', 'off', 'role', 'Odin', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'better', 'doubt', 'JThis', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'Saturday', 'night-', 'fast', 'fun', 'boasting', 'beautiful', 'visuals', 'unreal', 'Blu-ray', 'especially', 'world', 'Asgard', 'one', 'better', 'Marvel', 'movies', 'past', 'few', 'years']",N/A

1324689,A18SB6YZXTOF7W,B0034G4P80,George Zadorozny,"[1, 3]","THOR is a visually stunning movie well worth seeing.  The lead actors--Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Tom Hiddleston as Loki, and Anthony Hopkins as Odin--all perform admirably, though I do wish that the story had hewed rather more closely to the original vision of Jack Kirby, Thor's primary co-creator in the Marvel comics.Now I think most readers of this review will be surprised and confused to hear that Jack Kirby was the primary co-creator of Marvel's Thor, and not Stan Lee.  Indeed I love the dialogue and captioning that Mr. Lee wrote, but Stan's own words show that Jack Kirby was indeed the primary co-creator not only of Thor but also of the '60s Marvel Universe. In all justice, then, Jack should be at least as well known and celebrated as Stan, and should be getting top billing in the Marvel movies based on his work, which is almost all of the movies, definitely including the THOR film and THE AVENGERS.Here's what Stan Lee said when asked to talk about Jack Kirby:""BOB [Brodsky, interviewer]: Jack Kirby?""STAN: When you talk about Kirby you really run out of superlatives. Jack was a writer as well as an artist (as many of the legends were). He was incredibly imaginative and he did his most important writing with his drawing. When I say that I mean if I gave Jack a very brief idea of what I wanted for a story, he would run with it.""I could say 'Jack in this next story, I think I'd like to have Dr. Doom kidnap Sue Storm and bring her to Liberia [obviously Stan meant Latveria], then the Fantastic Four have to go after her and in the end Dr. Doom may promise that he won't hurt Sue if they do something, and Reed says OK I agree, and the Thing would say how can you trust him, and Reed would say despite all of his faults Doom is a man of honor, he would never lie.'""I would discuss the idea with Jack like that and that was all I had to do. And then Jack would go home and he would draw the story and he would add a million elements that I hadn't told him about, so he was really writing in pictures and dreaming up ideas along the way.""And then when I did write the copy (the words, the dialogue and the captions) it was such a joy because all I had to do was look at the illustration that Jack had done and each picture gave me a thousand new ideas. Jack never did a dull panel. Every drawing of his contained an expression [in] the characters' face that almost told me what kind of dialogue to write. Jack could get more drama into a few lines than any artist I knew. His imagination and the things he came up with were wonderful . . . and on top of that, he was fast!""I don't know how anybody could have been that good and that fast . . . when Jack drew, you had the feeling that Jack had the entire drawing in his mind and when he put the pencil on the paper he was just 'tracing' what he already had in his mind. Most artists would draw a circle for the head and a circle for the body and then they'd start filling it in, but Jack would just start with the head and he would draw it and every line was there right from the start. He didn't make little rough drawings first . . . it was the most eerie feeling watching him draw--you felt he was tracing what was already in his head. Jack Kirby . . . he was the most dependable artist in the world, he never missed a deadline. He never did a bad job . . . all his jobs were great.""It's hard to talk about Jack without sounding as if you're exaggerating because that's how good he was.""--Comic Book Marketplace magazine, # 61, July 1998, pages 48-49.What Stan says above fits perfectly with this item from the Marvel Bullpen Bulletin for March 1966, which I presume was written by Stan, and at any rate was published by Marvel, of course:""It isn't generally known, but many of our merry Marvel artists are also talented story men in their own right! For example, all Stan has to do with the pro's like JACK 'KING' KIRBY, dazzlin' DON HECK, and darlin' DICK AYERS is give them the germ of an idea, and they make up all the details as they go along, drawing and plotting out the story. Then, our leader simply takes the finished drawings and adds all the dialogue and captions! Sounds complicated? Maybe it is, but it's another reason why no one else can bring you that old Marvel magic!""This is the most thoroughgoing Marvel-published admission of Jack's towering primacy as to the creation of the Kirby/Lee stories that I have ever seen.It should also be noted that Larry Lieber, Stan's brother, wrote the outstanding and thrilling dialogue for the very first story with Marvel's Thor (the origin story, and also a few issues after that), but did so only after Jack had created most or all of the story by drawing it.Again, I love the wonderful dialogue and captioning that Stan wrote, but Stan's own words, quoted above, show that Jack Kirby was indeed the primary co-creator of the '60s Marvel Universe. In all justice, then, Jack should be at least as well known and celebrated as Stan, and should be getting top billing in the Marvel movies based on his work, which is almost all of the movies, definitely including THOR and THE AVENGERS.Stan was indispensable of course, but so, of course, was Jack Kirby, and now is the time to heap just and due honors upon this great, great storyteller for his stunning, splendid, visionary achievement.",4,Stan Lee's own words show that Jack Kirby was the primary co-creator of THOR and of the '60s Marvel Universe,1339027200,"06 7,

1324697,A2W2ODLRQ2L8LE,B0034G4P80,G. Max Gooding,"[2, 3]","BackgroundFirstly it should be noted that Thursday is derived from an Old English word, which effectively meant: ""Thunor's Day"". This in turn was influenced from another Old Norse word which effectively has the meaning ""Thor's Day"". In Germanic paganism, Thor is a hammer-wielding god associated with thunder, lightning, storms, oak trees, strength, destruction, fertility, healing, and the protection of mankind.In the early 1960s Marvel Comics introduced Thor into their line up of fictional superheroes. The Norse mythology character made appearances in several publications, and he became a member of the superhero team the Avengers. It is based on this comic book character that this film was produced. Next year, this character will also be featured in film called the Avengers.The ActorsVeteran actor Anthony Hopkins takes up the role as Odin. This was an excellent choice. His role was somewhat similar to his role in Beowulf. Natalie Portman (Best Actress Oscar winner 2010) plays Jane Foster, Thor's eventual earth bound sweetheart. The rest of the cast including Thor (Chris Hemsworth) are not as well known, however, their performances are quite acceptable.StorylineOdin has a secret, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is not really his son. His real roots end up making him a pretty nasty bad guy, which he portrays quite well. The action unfolds on Earth, Asgard and on another world where there was an ancient war. The sets are very well designed (and loaded with tons of computer graphics, especially Asgard). Thor develops and matures during this story. It is really a very extensive case of sibling rivalry.ConclusionThis film is quite enjoyable, but you get the feeling that something was missing. This maybe because a lot of time was spent trying to establish the whole concept of realm of Asgard. However, it makes a good launch pad for next year's Avengers Movie. There is a lot of drama elements included, but this seems to have taken the edge off of the action sequences.",4,A THORsday Night Special,1304899200,"05 9, 2011",2011,1983,"['should', 'be', 'noted', 'Thursday', 'derived', 'Old', 'English', 'word', 'effectively', 'meant', 'Thunor', 'Day', 'turn', 'was', 'influenced', 'Old', 'Norse', 'word', 'effectively', 'meaning', 'Thor', 'Day', 'Germanic', 'paganism', 'Thor', 'hammer-wielding', 'god', 'associated', 'thunder', 'lightning', 'storms', 'oak', 'trees', 'strength', 'destruction', 'fertility', 'healing', 'protection', 'mankind.In', 'early', '1960s', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'introduced', 'Thor', 'line', 'fictional', 'superheroes', 'Norse', 'mythology', 'character', 'made', 'appearances', 'several', 'publications', 'became', 'member', 'superhero', 'team', 'Avengers', 'based', 'comic', 'book', 'character', 'film', 'was', 'produced', 'Next', 'year', 'character', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'featured', 'film', 'called', 'Avengers.The', 'ActorsVeteran', 'actor', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'up', 'role', 'Odin', 'was', 'excellent', 'choice', 'role', 'was', 'somewhat', 'similar', 'role', 'Beowulf', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'winner', '2010', 'Jane', 'Foster', 'Thor', 'eventual', 'earth', 'sweetheart', 'rest', 'cast', 'including', 'Thor', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'well', 'known', 'however', 'performances', 'are', 'quite', 'acceptable.StorylineOdin', 'secret', 'Loki', 'Tom', 'Hiddleston', 'not', 'really', 'son', 'real', 'roots', 'end', 'up', 'making', 'pretty', 'nasty', 'bad', 'guy', 'quite', 'well', 'action', 'Earth', 'Asgard', 'world', 'where', 'was', 'ancient', 'war', 'sets', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'designed', 'loaded', 'tons', 'computer', 'graphics', 'especially', 'Asgard', 'Thor', 'story', 'really', 'very', 'extensive', 'case', 'sibling', 'rivalry.ConclusionThis', 'film', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'get', 'feeling', 'something', 'was', 'missing', 'maybe', 'lot', 'time', 'was', 'spent', 'trying', 'establish', 'whole', 'concept', 'realm', 'Asgard', 'However', 'good', 'launch', 'pad', 'next', 'year', 'Avengers', 'Movie', 'lot', 'drama', 'elements', 'included', 'have', 'taken', 'edge', 'action', 'sequences']",N/A

Seeing it without the 3D variation that accompanied the theatrical release was a further detriment in deciding to watch it, but when a director of the caliber of Kenneth Branagh and a cast of both seasoned performers and exciting new faces pass the credit notification then it is tempting to give it a try. The surprise is that this is a very entertaining movie.  There is a lot of CGI business that probably in 3D was even more beautiful (the rainbow bridge, the ice realm etc), but even in regular vision the sets and designs are truly beautiful.  Some viewers might expect a version of the Viking gods adventure, but this is clearly a fairy tale version - tripping between the earth realm and the home of the gods, and that in and of itself make the film more enjoyable: it doesn't seem to take itself too seriously  and that is refreshing.Odin (Anthony Hopkins) rules Asgard and has two sons - Thor (Chris Hemsworth, an Adonis with a very magnetic screen presence) and Loki (Tom Hiddleston) - by his devoted wife Frigga (Rene Russo).  Odin is about to pass his crown to Thor when the latter makes some wrong decisions and is cast out of the kingdom and lands in New Mexico where he encounters a scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and her father Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgrd) and weirdo friend Darcy (Kat Dennings). From Jane, Thor learns kindness, compassion and love and has become more the son that Odin desired.  Meanwhile back at home Loki is taking over (being the true son of King Laufey (Colm Feore) and as Odin lies dying Thor's buddies - Volstagg (Ray Stevenson), Hogun (Tadanobu Asano), Fandral (Josh Dallas, a real find!), and Sif (Jaimie Alexander) with a bit of help from the gatekeeper Heimdall (Idris Elba) - descend to earth to aid Thor is becoming the quality of king he should be, etc etcIn addition to the named cast there is a very very brief appearance by Jeremy Renner that just may be a signal that the followup THE AVENGERS will be around  soon.  The movie has a lot going for it, especially it the audience can sit back and enjoy the comic book atmosphere of this mixture of make believe and real life people.  It is surprisingly successful!

The actors acquitted themselves wonderfully, although Natalie Portman's part could have been played by most anybody. The lead was charismatic and humorous as the brash Thor, who has a lot to learn about being the next King of Asgard. Hopkins is inimitable and fierce as Odin, and Loki is well-cast and well-played, the brooding competitor to the throne.Ultimately it is a story about fathers and sons, and the tragic ways in which we may choose to gain their approval, which makes for some surprises. Although most of the plot is telegraphed, it is nevertheless touching, and you will find yourself rooting for reconciliation. It is a joy to behold the script, the acting, and the SFX. Asgard is a sight to see, and the clash between the mortal Thor and his new habitation in New Mexico makes for some great gags. ""I like this drink. Bring me another!"" and his brief quest for a steed are sure to bring some chuckles.The Frost Giants are so-so as far as FX, but there are plenty of thundering scenes, with or without Mjolnir. You will see the four friends face off with the Destroyer and a pretty multicultural Asgard, among other things. The setting is not quite as epic as expected, being set in a smallish town, but of course the stakes are high nevertheless.Doyle's score is suitably rousing and grand, although the main theme - that is, the sequence of primary notes of the theme -  is unremarkable, at least on first hearing, unlike his memorable ""Henry V.""Watch for the short blurb after the credits.",4,Great Thun!,1304380800,"05 3, 2011",2011,1600,"['Was', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'see', 'Asia', 'reclining', 'seat', 'movie', 'was', 'lot', 'fun', 'actors', 'acquitted', 'wonderfully', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'part', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'played', 'most', 'anybody', 'lead', 'was', 'charismatic', 'humorous', 'brash', 'Thor', 'who', 'lot', 'learn', 'being', 'next', 'King', 'Asgard', 'Hopkins', 'inimitable', 'fierce', 'Odin', 'Loki', 'well-cast', 'well-played', 'brooding', 'competitor', 'throne.Ultimately', 'story', 'fathers', 'sons', 'tragic', 'ways', 'may', 'choose', 'gain', 'approval', 'surprises', 'most', 'plot', 'telegraphed', 'nevertheless', 'touching', 'will', 'find', 'rooting', 'reconciliation', 'joy', 'behold', 'script', 'acting', 'SFX', 'Asgard', 'sight', 'see', 'clash', 'mortal', 'Thor', 'new', 'habitation', 'New', 'Mexico', 'great', 'gags', 'like', 'drink', 'Bring', 'brief', 'quest', 'steed', 'are', 'sure', 'bring', 'chuckles.The', 'Frost', 'Giants', 'are', 'so-so', 'as', 'far', 'FX', 'are', 'plenty', 'thundering', 'scenes', 'Mjolnir', 'will', 'see', 'four', 'friends', 'face', 'Destroyer', 'pretty', 'multicultural', 'Asgard', 'other', 'things', 'setting', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'epic', 'expected', 'being', 'set', 'smallish', 'town', 'course', 'stakes', 'are', 'high', 'nevertheless.Doyle', 'score', 'suitably', 'rousing', 'grand', 'main', 'theme', 'sequence', 'primary', 'notes', 'theme', 'unremarkable', 'least', 'first', 'hearing', 'memorable', 'Henry', 'V.', 'Watch', 'short', 'blurb', 'credits']",N/A

1324718,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0034G4P80,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[6, 8]","Maybe the biggest feat this movie accomplishes is that it makes Marvel Comics' version of Thor pretty accessible to the general public, thus advancing Stan Lee's eeeeevil plan for world domination. The story splits its time between Thor's exile on Earth and the throne-ousting goings-on in the wondrous realms of Asgard and Jotunheim. By the end, you get a good sense of what the Thunderer is all about, and the worlds he inhabits. As per usual, there's plenty of beats and references to tie it all into big Marvel film continuity.Thor Odinson, the Norse God of Thunder, is about as subtle and retiring as his war hammer, mighty Mj&ouml;llnir. Firstborn son of Odin the All-Father, Thor is brash and arrogant and is about as frontline a warrior as one can get. When his act of sheer foolhardiness reignites the war between the Asgardians and the frost giants of Jotunheim, an angered Odin banishes his favorite son to Midgard below (but we call it Earth). This is all actually bits of flashback. The present story begins with astrophysicist (no, not a nurse) Jane Foster studying wormhole phenomena in the desert outskirts of Puente Antiguo, a sleepy New Mexico town. As Jane Foster eventually learns, the wormhole phenomenon is a mystical gateway thru which a disgraced and now mortal thunder god is sent hurtling.The segue paragraph: DC Comics has got its work cut out, trying to match the quality of these Marvel flicks. I was in the theater, eying the comic book-related movie trailers. I was very intrigued with CAPTAIN AMERICA, somewhat interested in COWBOYS & ALIENS (which is from neither Marvel or DC), and a bit put off with GREEN LANTERN (can't Hal Jordan be more imaginative than calling up swords and big laser guns with his all-powerful ring?). I was initially concerned about THOR, and how he'll be translated to the big screen, but word's been good from its overseas release, and, it turns out, this is a really entertaining picture. Director Kenneth Branagh historically does well when you toss him a few Shakespearean bones.Thor simply begs for elements of grandeur, of spectacular derring-do, big myth, and those Shakespearean touches. Branagh peppers in themes of dysfunction in the royal family, bitter sibling rivalry, treachery, loss and redemption. As a weary and broken-hearted Odin collapses into the Odinsleep (in which he replenishes his strength), Thor's younger brother seizes the opportunity to claim the throne. Except in his own twisty way, this is only one step into worming his way into his father's heart. Or that's what I got out of it. Loki, god of mischief and of exceedingly big-horned helmets, is a complicated backstabbing guy.Complementing the grandiose spectacle of Asgard and the wintry barrenness of Jotunheim, Thor's time in New Mexico provides some grounding, some toning-down relief. I was pleasantly surprised that Branagh was able to interject moments of humor, and these moments are found in Thor's interactions with the humans. Thor himself has been reduced to a mere mortal state, even though he retains that godly physique and he never does lose that sense of self-belief. Shortly after Thor's plummet (and getting smacked around by Jane Foster's ride), the New Mexico desert is rocked by another wormhole phenomenon, this time heralding the arrival of the enchanted hammer Mj&ouml;llnir. Lodged in a large piece of rock, Mj&ouml;llnir is unmoveable, even though many men would try to extract it (even a cameo-ing Stan Lee is not worthy enough). Eventually, S.H.I.E.L.D. locks down the place, erects a camp around it, and there goes that carnival atmosphere.Old hands like Natalie Portman, Stellan Skarsgrd, Rene Russo, and the always reliable Anthony Hopkins are featured, but the movie rightfully belongs to lesser-known actors like Tom Hiddleston, Jamie Andrews, and Chris Hemsworth. Hemsworth, especially, anchors the film. He has a presence that extends beyond the sculpted muscles. His boastful thunder god is likable, and he does well in those quieter, redemptive moments. The guy has charisma. I think it's the beard. I wish I had a beard.Hiddleston lends a brooding complexity to the the scheming Loki. The stunning Jamie Andrews, for my money, outshines Natalie Portman, although, admittedly, Andrews has the more showy role. Andrews convincingly plays the lady warrior Sif, and I only wish she'd had more chances to show off her fighting skills. Meanwhile, each time Portman lavished Hemsworth with one of those adoring looks, the theater audience snickered. That may be the one overriding issue I have with this film. Natalie Portman doesn't make Jane Foster someone so special that it would motivate a prideful Thor to become a gentler, kinder thunder god worthy of wielding Mj&ouml;llnir. Meanwhile, Idris Elba is fantastic as the impressive Heimdall, eagle-eyed guardian of the Bifrost Bridge. Heimdall rapidly becomes one of my favorite characters. As a sheer treat for me, personally, Kat Dennings (from the fabulous NICK & NORAH'S INFINITE PLAYLIST) has a snarky supporting part as Jane Foster's colleague.So Marvel's streak continues, of putting out really watchable film products, and we're only about a year away now from the Avengers movie. Thor makes for a majestic hero, and I'm almost loathe to label him a superhero because that seems to strip away some of that regal aura. There are moments of sheer awesomeness in which Thor demonstrates just how powerful he is. This is a guy who routinely goes toe to toe against giant monsters. I will say that the Destroyer construct (and its disintegrator beam) is damn impressive, and the special effects crew really did a bang-up job on it, and overall, really. For longtime comic book readers, THOR presents a series of Easter eggs, among which are references to the Hulk and Tony Stark and a tantalizing glimpse of Hawkeye.*** SPOILER ALERT *** Regarding the post-closing credits scene, I'm not sure that a SPOILER is even warranted, because I'm not sure a lot of folks will know what they'll be looking at. But, as usual, stick around for the post-closing credits sequence. It features Nick Fury, Dr. Selvig and an unseen Loki gazing at an object of limitless power. But if, like most in the movie theater, you ended up asking, ""Okay, what the hell is that all about?"" What it is, yo, is the cosmic cube.",4,"""You know, for a crazy homeless person... he's pretty cut.""",1304726400,"05 7, 2011",2011,6330,"['Maybe', 'biggest', 'feat', 'movie', 'Marvel', 'Comics',

1324731,A2ICW5OUWX2A2V,B0034G4P80,Ian,"[0, 1]","As Marvel continues their quest to create an entire film universe for their heroes to run around in, their latest effort at expanding this ever-growing library involves the god of thunder himself, Thor.  Compared to many other comic book hero films that have come out over the past several years, can ""Thor"" stand up?""Thor"" follows the titular god of thunder, and his mischievous brother Loki.  On the day of his ascension to the throne of Asgard, fabled home of the Norse gods, an old enemy manages to infiltrate Asgard and nearly make away with a dangerous weapon.  Overreacting, Thor sets out to prove his worth, only to set in motion a disastrous series of events that could lead to a mythological war, and his own permanent exile from those he loves.Unlike the other films set in the Marvel Universe, ""Thor"" takes a heavy mythological route with it's story, which is a tried-and-true ""Fish out of water/Coming of age"" story.  While the plot itself is predictable, the movie benefits from it's production values and a good sense of humor.  Marvel put a lot of time, effort, and resources into the film, and it shows:  Asgard is big and beautiful, easily a realm of gods, and the costumes, weapons, and creatures are beautiful to look at.  And to make things even better, ""Thor"" has a great sense of humor, with some very funny jokes fitting into the theme of Thor being out of his element on Earth, especially with a scene set in a pet store.However, Thor does suffer somewhat from being a bit short.  While the film has a run time close to two hours, the second and third acts of the film move from one beat to the next at close to breakneck speed.  By the time the film finishes, it's hard to believe that's it's actually done, leaving the feeling that there's too much story crammed into too short a running time.But despite it's pacing issues, ""Thor"" is an excellent comic-book film that features a large mythological scope, great comedy, high production values, and engaging action.  All of it combines to create a film that, while slightly overstuffed, is still great fun, and well worth watching, making it arguably one of the better Marvel films to date.",4,It's hammer time!,1304812800,"05 8, 2011",2011,2166,"['Marvel', 'quest', 'create', 'entire', 'film', 'universe', 'heroes', 'run', 'around', 'latest', 'effort', 'expanding', 'ever-growing', 'library', 'god', 'thunder', 'Thor', 'Compared', 'many', 'other', 'comic', 'book', 'hero', 'films', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'past', 'several', 'years', 'can', 'Thor', 'stand', 'up', 'Thor', 'titular', 'god', 'thunder', 'mischievous', 'brother', 'Loki', 'day', 'ascension', 'throne', 'Asgard', 'fabled', 'home', 'Norse', 'gods', 'old', 'enemy', 'infiltrate', 'Asgard', 'nearly', 'make', 'away', 'dangerous', 'weapon', 'Overreacting', 'Thor', 'out', 'prove', 'worth', 'only', 'set', 'motion', 'disastrous', 'series', 'events', 'could', 'lead', 'mythological', 'war', 'own', 'permanent', 'exile', 'loves.Unlike', 'other', 'films', 'set', 'Marvel', 'Universe', 'Thor', 'heavy', 'mythological', 'route', 'story', 'tried-and-true', 'Fish', 'water/Coming', 'age', 'story', 'plot', 'predictable', 'movie', 'benefits', 'production', 'values', 'good', 'sense', 'humor', 'Marvel', 'put', 'lot', 'time', 'effort', 'resources', 'film', 'Asgard', 'big', 'beautiful', 'easily', 'realm', 'gods', 'costumes', 'weapons', 'creatures', 'are', 'beautiful', 'look', 'make', 'things', 'even', 'better', 'Thor', 'great', 'sense', 'humor', 'very', 'funny', 'jokes', 'fitting', 'theme', 'Thor', 'being', 'element', 'Earth', 'especially', 'scene', 'set', 'pet', 'store.However', 'Thor', 'suffer', 'somewhat', 'being', 'bit', 'short', 'film', 'run', 'time', 'close', 'two', 'hours', 'second', 'third', 'acts', 'film', 'move', 'one', 'beat', 'next', 'close', 'breakneck', 'speed', 'time', 'film', 'finishes', 'hard', 'believe', 'actually', 'done', 'leaving', 'feeling', 'too', 'much', 'story', 'crammed', 'too', 'short', 'running', 'time.But', 'pacing', 'issues', 'Thor', 'excellent', 'comic-book', 'film', 'large', 'mythological', 'scope', 'great', 'comedy', 'high', 'production', 'values', 'engaging', 'action', 'create', 'film', 'slightly', 'overstuffed', 'still', 'great', 'fun', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'making', 'arguably', 'one', 'better', 'Marvel', 'films', 'date']",N/A

Stellan Skarsgard, Ray Stevenson, Joshua Dalla, Jamie Alexander, and Darcy Lewis all were excellent in their supporting roles.The only drawback -- I believe this movie and Captain America came out to create interest in the Avengers movie that came out this year.

The super heroes are fighting off all would be terrorist, at the nearest cinemaplex! I guess it is a sign of the times. Many of us living out our own repressed vigilante emotions through the silver screen, or should it be, the 3-D screen? We're also having a lot of fun doing it, but like any genre onslaught, there is a mixed bag of popcorn movies, some freshly popped with the right amount of butter & salt, others with one to many old maids sitting at the bottom of the bag, waiting for you to crack your tooth on.""Thor"" sits at the bottom of the better upper third of the onslaught. The perfect film for that bag of popcorn & large pop that cost you $20 extra. Don't fear though, the sound of the popcorn your chewing inside your mouth won't make you miss any great social commentary.  Then again, with the exception of truly groundbreaking genre films like, ""Watchmen,"" & the last two Batman's, these films are not meant to be huge beacons of social commentary. Just sit back & enjoy the fun! ""Thor"" does exactly what it sets out to do, a movie for the escapists in all of us. Close to two hours of just sit back & veg out. Sure, it has it themes of arrogance, jealously, love, & heroism, but it does not demand you to sit & watch it five times to catch all the nuances & red herrings. It just wants you to come along for the ride, which is not the greatest thrill ride of the genre, but an enjoyable outing in outer space to the desert of New Mexico.""Thor"" features very good special effects & CGI, more or less, one in the same anymore. It has likeable characters, some down right funny scenes, & Chris Hemsworth plays the role of the lighting god with charisma & a twinkle in his eye, winking away at the audience. I got to say though, when Thor puts on civilian earth clothes, I kept expecting him to grab a guitar & sing a country song, LOL! I think they should've made his hair longer for the role, because he looked more like a country music flavor of the day hunk, than a Viking god, but oh well, that's just me. Oh, there is also a funny reference to King Arthur, as Thor's hammer is protruding from a pillar of rock in the desert. All the local he-men, a four wheel drive pickup truck, whose bed pops off, & Thor himself, try to pull it free from the rock, just like ""Excalibur,"" but to no avail. Only the one worthy, will be able to wield the hammer of Thor!In the end, I found ""Thor"" to be a very enjoyable, though not an amazing comic book hero film, but I do see where it could go on to something bigger & better, ""the Avengers.""

The best parts of the movie are Chris Hemsworth as Thor and Tom Hiddleston as Loki, Thor's adopted brother and the villain of this film (he's also the villain in *The Avengers,* a film that displays Hiddleston's acting talents to much greater effect). Ironically, the worst parts of the film are the two Oscar winners who inexplicably find themselves in a comic book movie trying to ACT all over the place. I'm talking about Anthony Hopkins as Odin, Thor's father and the chief god, and Natalie Portman, who is allegedly a scientist/researcher but who turns into a mushy, goofy middle school girl whenever Thor flashes her a smile.

1324756,A2OU415LB9I5J6,B0034G4P80,Jason C. Wilkerson,"[159, 200]","Comic book fans get a lot of flak for being nerds, dweebs and geeks; or at least they used to. Now comics are en vogue as millions of people attend geekfests like Comic Con; although whether that's to see the movie and television stars in attendance remains to be seen. Comic book characters are our mythology, they rival the super powered beings and gods of ancient Greek, Mesopotamian, and Viking mythology. We as humans have always felt this need to look up to higher powers to sort out our lives, believing that the fate of our race is better left in the hands of someone capable of bending the rules of physics. It's only natural then that eventually the worlds of comics and ancient mythology would collide as it does in the new Marvel movie Thor.Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is the arrogant first born son of King Odin (Anthony Hopkins) of Asgard, and the rightful heir to the throne. When Thor commits an act that could lead to war between Asgard and the Frostgiants, with whom they have a very shaky truce, Odin strips Thor of his powers and banishes him to Earth until he learns humility. On Earth Thor is found by astrophysicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and her team (Stellan Skarsgard, Kat Dennings) as they study atmospheric disturbances in New Mexico.Thor is one of Marvel's lesser known properties, despite having been created by Stan Lee back in 1962. An integral character in Marvel's super powered team The Avengers, the movie version of the comic book was announced not long after the success of Iron Man as part of Marvel Studios attempt to bring The Avengers to the big screen. While Marvel has had great success with the first Iron Man movie and to a lesser extent Iron Man 2 and The Incredible Hulk (which is the closest Marvel Studios has come to failure so far), Thor was a risky proposition with the greatest potential for failure. How does one meld the worlds of the mythical Asgard and Earth seamlessly into a movie that is part of a bigger picture with characters that are based solely in our realm?Enter Kenneth Branagh. The success of Thor can largely be pinned on having a filmmaker with appropriate gravitas to ground the film. Branagh is a star of stage as well as film (for those of you unfamiliar with the name he played Gilderoy Lockhart in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets). The presence of Branagh alone was somewhat curious considering he's known more for directing acclaimed works like Hamlet (1996) and Henry V (1989) and even as an Irishman the English consider him one of the leaders in Shakespearean theater. It's that knowledge of film and theater that really guides Thor as he borrows as much from Shakespeare's Henry V as he does from modern action films.Also adding to the weight of Kenneth Branagh's credentials are a list of acclaimed and award winning actors and actresses such as Anthony Hopkins, Natalie Portman, Stellan Skarsgard, Rene Russo, and Idris Elba. Not only do they have the opportunity to ground the movie, but they also look like they're having fun. Part of why we enjoy this movie is because we can see that they enjoy the movie. No one ever really feels like they're hamming it up or sleepwalking through their scenes, you get the sense that aside from the emotions they convey for their characters concerning their predicaments they all want to be on this set and that feeling is infectious. Also Tom Hiddleston's Loki is a revelation at a time when I have to admit that Marvel Studio's previous villains have been lacking a certain je ne sais que. Hiddleston plays the character with a secret, and a glimmer behind the eyes that slowly unravels like a ripe onion throughout the film holding on to his deceit with the hope of another day. He's more complex than the previous villains that have come out of Marvel Studios, and I'm looking forward to his return in The Avengers.The real linchpin for why this all works though is Chris Hemsworth. While having been around here and there in blink and you'll miss it parts, Hemsworth got his first big break in JJ Abrams Star Trek reboot in the pivotal role of George Kirk, father of James T. Kirk. While his place in geekdom had been set in a small yet important role, the question of whether he could pull off the Norse god turned Marvel superhero. In a lot of actor's hands this would have been a one note character bereft of emotion and humor. Hemsworth is a magnetic leading man, though, exuding charisma and confidence. His poise commands respect, and he effortlessly flows from emotion to emotion, arrogance to humility, with a comedic timing that leaves the audience in stitches but still doesn't undermine his character.As with most, if not all comic book movies, this movie tries hard to give you a lot of plot in a short two hour span (I say short because it leaves you wanting more, the way a good action movie should). Naturally, some things are a little undercooked but don't ruin the movie. In the end, as much as I fell in love with Natalie Portman's character (as I do with almost any character she plays) the romantic connection between Thor and Foster didn't ring true because for most of the film he seemed somewhat disinterested only to find his infatuation with her later in the movie. Thor's progression from arrogant strongman to humble hero also seems to be slightly haphazard as it really feels as though it could have used more time to flesh out. Hemsworth does an admirable job making the audience feel each twist and turn of the character, but each twist and turn feels a little too abrupt to be genuine.All in all though, this was an excellent film: a piece of escapist entertainment that embraces Shakespeare as much as it embraces modern blockbuster pop-art. On the scales of Marvel I'd rate this just slightly under Iron Man and far above Iron Man 2 and The Incredible Hulk. The fact that they were able to get Thor right gives me hope for The First Avenger: Captain America and The Avengers. If you're a fan of comic book movies, Iron Man, or Marvel I highly recommend that you give this film a try. Not to mention, this is quite possibly the best use of 3D I recall since Avatar.

1324766,A1AQBOWEL8TROJ,B0034G4P80,Jean-ren Leroux,"[13, 30]","Funny. I didn't get bored once during the course of ""Thor"". But if i start to think about it, most of what i have is complains. Not so much for what's on the screen but mostly for what is not. The music, especially the main theme, of Patrick Doyle was awesome and the charisma of the actors literally saved the day, that i can say. But too many questions are left unexplored and too many occasions are missed in order for me to fully appreciate this film.The religiosity of it all disappointed me. The lack of it, to be more precise. What is a typical day for a God or a half-God? Do they simply sit on thrones and say important things? Do they simply stand still and look at space? The everyday nature of things was not clear and i do feel that this is an important point if you want to understand why those Gods love their home and their role. I would much rather stay on Earth, with the beautiful Natalie Portman, then return to Asgard. I never felt like i wanted to be there in the first place and live their lives.And Gods cand die? Is that it? And they're capable of showing childish jealousy? What happens when we, ourselves, die? Do we go to Odin? So then, Jesus does not exist?When you want to install a universe as a background for a story, don't you need to know every little detail even if you're not going to use them? In ""Avatar"" or ""The Lord Of The Rings"", you really do feel like you're in a ""real"" world with its complexities. Not Asgard. It feels static, like if every little place was built only because the script required it. It exists only for the duration of the scene.On another level, super heroes have big cities to play in. Thor has... what? A small rural county lost in the desert? No headlines or media coverage? No chance for us to witness the heroism of our Hero through the eyes of the world? And is it normal for the character of Natalie Portman, a scientist, to believe so rapidly in Thor?Basically, i feel like this movie wasn't taken seriously and that the universe and characters weren't really ""loved"" by the auhtors. Even the end was a let down. First, with the hammer (that simply ""goes"" to Thor ratter than being pulled from its plinthe, like the Excalibur sword) and second, with the ascension of The God of Thunder himself.This last one (the ascension) is personal to me but darn it! The last track of the soundtrack is called ""Earth To Asgard"" and is simply glorious. Knowing the story, knowing that it's the last track, i would have thought that the last image of the film, accompanied by that great theme, would have been Thor flying with all his newfound glory to the sky while smiling and/or winking at Jane. A perfect way to end on a high. And boum! Fade to black. Instead, we have Thor sit around and laugh with his God-like Friends in a God-like Cafeteria.I feel that this isn't the way you leave characters you truly love.",2,Why go to Asgard when you have Natalie Portman on Earth?,1306713600,"05 30, 2011",2011,2874,"['Funny', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'bored', 'once', 'course', 'Thor', 'i', 'start', 'think', 'most', 'what', 'i', 'have', 'complains', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'what', 'screen', 'mostly', 'what', 'not', 'music', 'especially', 'main', 'theme', 'Patrick', 'Doyle', 'was', 'awesome', 'charisma', 'actors', 'literally', 'saved', 'day', 'i', 'can', 'say', 'too', 'many', 'questions', 'are', 'left', 'unexplored', 'too', 'many', 'occasions', 'are', 'missed', 'order', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'film.The', 'religiosity', 'disappointed', 'lack', 'be', 'more', 'precise', 'What', 'typical', 'day', 'God', 'half-God', 'Do', 'simply', 'sit', 'thrones', 'say', 'important', 'things', 'Do', 'simply', 'stand', 'still', 'look', 'space', 'everyday', 'nature', 'things', 'was', 'not', 'clear', 'i', 'do', 'feel', 'important', 'point', 'want', 'understand', 'why', 'Gods', 'love', 'home', 'role', 'would', 'much', 'rather', 'stay', 'Earth', 'beautiful', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'then', 'return', 'Asgard', 'never', 'felt', 'i', 'wanted', 'be', 'there', 'first', 'place', 'live', 'lives.And', 'Gods', 'cand', 'die', ""'re"", 'capable', 'showing', 'childish', 'jealousy', 'What', 'when', 'die', 'Do', 'go', 'Odin', 'So', 'then', 'Jesus', 'not', 'exist', 'When', 'want', 'install', 'universe', 'background', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'know', 'little', 'detail', 'even', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'use', 'Avatar', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'really', 'do', 'feel', ""'re"", 'real', 'world', 'complexities', 'Not', 'Asgard', 'static', 'little', 'place', 'was', 'built', 'only', 'script', 'required', 'only', 'duration', 'scene.On', 'level', 'super', 'heroes', 'have', 'big', 'cities', 'play', 'Thor', 'what', 'small', 'rural', 'county', 'lost', 'desert', 'headlines', 'media', 'coverage', 'chance', 'witness', 'heroism', 'Hero', 'eyes', 'world', 'normal', 'character', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'scientist', 'believe', 'so', 'rapidly', 'Thor', 'Basically', 'i', 'feel', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'taken', 'seriously', 'universe', 'characters', 'were', ""n't"", 'really', 'loved', 'auhtors', 'Even', 'end', 'was', 'let', 'down', 'First', 'hammer', 'simply', 'Thor', 'ratter', 'being', 'pulled', 'plinthe', 'Excalibur', 'sword', 'second', 'ascension', 'God', 'Thunder', 'himself.This', 'last', 'one', 'ascension', 'personal', 'darn', 'last', 'track', 'soundtrack', 'called', 'Earth', 'Asgard', 'simply', 'glorious', 'Knowing', 'story', 'knowing', 'last', 'track', 'i', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'last', 'image', 'film', 'accompanied', 'great', 'theme', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'Thor', 'flying', 'newfound', 'glory', 'sky', 'smiling', 'and/or', 'winking', 'Jane', 'perfect', 'way', 'end', 'high', 'boum', 'Fade', 'black', 'Instead', 'have', 'Thor', 'sit', 'God-like', 'Friends', 'God-like', 'Cafeteria.I', 'feel', ""n't"", 'way', 'leave', 'characters', 'truly', 'love']",N/A

Starring Chris Hemsworth in the title role, it also boasts Natalie Portman as Jane Foster, Tom Hiddleston as Loki, Colm Feore as Laufey, Jaimie Alexander as Sif, and Anthony Hopkins as Odin.  Rounding out the cast are Idris Elba, Stellan Skarsgard, Rene Russo, Ray Stevenson, Clark Gregg, Joshua Dallas and Tadanobu Asano.It opens with Jane Foster and her small team of storm chasers on the trail of the latest in a series of unusual meteorological occurrences and they nearly run a man down in the process.  Flashback to the Dark Ages where Odin narrates a montage explaining the Nine Realms and the Asgardians war with the Frost Giants of Jotunheim, resulting in a fragile truce.  Skip forward to Thor's ascension day when on the verge of being named Odin's successor a trio of frost giants breaks into the trophy room trying to steal the Cask of Ancient Winters, a powerful jotun artifact taken during the war.  Enraged but ordered by Odin not to retaliate, Thor and his brother Loki, along with their friends Sif, Volstagg, Hodun and Fandral, slip away to Jotunheim to confront Laufey, the frost giant king.  Laufey goads Thor into attacking and only Odin's personal intervention saves the group from destruction, but not before Loki makes a chilling discovery.  Thor challenges his father's inaction and Odin realizes his hotheaded son still has much to learn.  He strips Thor of his power and casts him down to Earth, also sealing away the power of the hammer Mjolnir until Thor is worthy to reclaim it.  Loki confronts Odin about what he's learned- which Odin confesses to- but all the combined stress forces him into the Odinsleep, a hibernation state which replenishes his power.  Acting as regent, Loki devises a scheme that will end the war, as well as serving other purposes.The script is good with some decent jokes both obvious and insider, but stretches paper thin in some places.  Mostly based upon the Marvel Ultimates storylines it draws references from different aspects of Thor's comic book history, including the creative runs of Walt Simonson, J. Michael Straczynski and Ralph Macchio (no, not that one).  Certain things could've used a little more development or exposition, but that would've gotten in the way of a good SFX shot.  But it does a great job maintaining the Avengers continuity that's being established, as well slipping in an intriguing cameo.  It even ties in the Mjolnir teaser clip from Iron Man 2.  And yeah, you need to stay after the credits for this one as well.The FX are as good as we've come to expect- mostly.  The frost giant battle has some nice moments with Thor wielding his hammer in classic comic book form- whipping it around to create storm effects as well as the seminal return to his hand after being thrown.  Asgard is modeled on some form of organic technology that works hand in hand with magic making for a shining, heavenly realm that's just a little too perfect.  Golden spires, gleaming halls, burnished armor- paradise never looked so... fake.  The Bifrost Rainbow Bridge looks like a bunch of LiteBrites low on batteries.  And of course, the frost giants have misshapen forms, glowing red eyes and dwell in the eternal chill gloom of Jotunheim.  Why?  Because they're eee-vil.Chris Hemsworth fills the role like he wrote it himself.  Thor is brash and boastful, even flipping Mjolnir around like it was a toy.  On Earth when he realizes what Odin's done, his angst isn't sappy or whiny, but confused and resolved to make amends.  The best character in the movie is usually the villain, and Tom Hiddleston's Loki steals the show.  It's Loki's character arc that actually drives the movie; his machinations and personal conflict are engaging: at the risk of being geeky, Loki pulls a Batman Gambit- maneuvering people and events while exploiting everyone's natures to do what he wants, but if it fails...  The only problem is initially he's all over the place, doing things that appear to contradict his goals.  But even then there's clues as to what's going on with him, and the payoff delivers.Thor's lifelong friends, The Warriors Three- as they identify themselves- are kind of one-dimensional and cartoonish, but then they were often portrayed that way in the comics.  The only one of his buddies that gets any measure of characterization is Sif, for the obvious reason that she may still end up as a potential love interest.Thor hits all the right notes and should be the first blockbuster of the year.  It does everything it's supposed to and leaves you hungry for more- i.e., Captain America and XMen: First Class.  Can't wait.",4,May The Norse Be With You,1304726400,"05 7, 2011",2011,4780,"['Thor', 'latest', 'superhero', 'flick', 'Marvel', 'Avengers', 'property', 'Thunder', 'God', 'comic', 'hero', 'path', 'will', 'lead', 'becoming', 'one', 'Earth', 'Mightiest', 'Heroes', 'Starring', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'title', 'role', 'also', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'Jane', 'Foster', 'Tom', 'Hiddleston', 'Loki', 'Colm', 'Feore', 'Laufey', 'Jaimie', 'Alexander', 'Sif', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Odin', 'Rounding', 'out', 'cast', 'are', 'Idris', 'Elba', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgard', 'Rene', 'Russo', 'Ray', 'Stevenson', 'Clark', 'Gregg', 'Joshua', 'Dallas', 'Tadanobu', 'Asano.It', 'Jane', 'Foster', 'small', 'team', 'storm', 'chasers', 'trail', 'latest', 'series', 'unusual', 'meteorological', 'occurrences', 'nearly', 'run', 'man', 'down', 'process', 'Flashback', 'Dark', 'Ages', 'where', 'Odin', 'montage', 'explaining', 'Nine', 'Realms', 'Asgardians', 'war', 'Frost', 'Giants', 'Jotunheim', 'resulting', 'fragile', 'truce', 'Skip', 'forward', 'Thor', 'ascension', 'day', 'when', 'verge', 'being', 'named', 'Odin', 'successor', 'trio', 'frost', 'giants', 'breaks', 'trophy', 'room', 'trying', 'steal', 'Cask', 'Ancient', 'Winters', 'powerful', 'jotun', 'artifact', 'taken', 'war', 'Enraged', 'ordered', 'Odin', 'not', 'retaliate', 'Thor', 'brother', 'Loki', 'friends', 'Sif', 'Volstagg', 'Hodun', 'Fandral', 'away', 'Jotunheim', 'confront', 'Laufey', 'frost', 'giant', 'king', 'Laufey', 'Thor', 'attacking', 'only', 'Odin', 'personal', 'intervention', 'group', 'destruction', 'not', 'Loki', 'chilling', 'discovery', 'Thor', 'father', 'inaction', 'Odin', 'hotheaded', 'son', 'still', 'much', 'learn', 'Thor', 'power', 'down', 'Earth', 'also', 'sealing', 'away', 'power', 'hammer', 'Mjolnir', 'Thor', 'worthy', 'reclaim', 'Loki', 'confronts', 'Odin', 'what', 'learned-', 'Odin', 'to-', 'combined', 'stress', 'forces', 'Odinsleep', 'hibernation', 'state', 'power', 'Acting', 'regent', 'Loki', 'scheme', 'will', 'end', 'war', 'as', 'well', 'serving', 'other', 'purposes.The', 'script', 'good', 'decent', 'jokes', 'obvious', 'insider', 'stretches', 'paper', 'thin', 'places', 'Mostly', 'based', 'Marvel', 'Ultimates', 'references', 'different', 'aspects', 'Thor', 'comic', 'book', 'history', 'including', 'creative', 'runs', 'Walt', 'Simonson', 'J.', 'Michael', 'Straczynski', 'Ralph', 'Macchio', 'not', 'one', 'Certain', 'things', 'could', ""'ve"", 'used', 'little', 'more', 'development', 'exposition', 'would', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'way', 'good', 'SFX', 'shot', 'great', 'job', 'maintaining', 'Avengers', 'continuity', 'being', 'established', 'well', 'slipping', 'intriguing', 'cameo', 'even', 'Mjolnir', 'teaser', 'clip', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'yeah', 'need', 'stay', 'credits', 'one', 'well.The', 'FX', 'are', 'as', 'good', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect-', 'mostly', 'frost', 'giant', 'battle', 'nice', 'moments', 'Thor', 'wielding', 'hammer', 'classic', 'comic', 'book', 'form-', 'whipping', 'create', 'storm', 'effects', 'as', 'well', 'seminal', 'return', 'hand', 'being', 'thrown', 'Asgard', 'modeled', 'form', 'organic', 'technology', 'hand', 'hand', 'magic', 'making', 'shining', 'heavenly', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'perfect', 'Golden', 'spires', 'gleaming', 'halls', 'burnished', 'armor-', 'paradise', 'never', 'looked', 'so', 'fake', 'Bifrost', 'Rainbow', 'Bridge', 'bunch', 'LiteBrites', 'low', 'batteries', 'course', 'frost', 'giants', 'have', 'misshapen', 'forms', 'glowing', 'red', 'eyes', 'dwell', 'eternal', 'chill', 'gloom', 'Jotunheim', 'Why', ""'re"", 'eee-vil.Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'role', 'wrote', 'Thor', 'brash', 'boastful', 'even', 'flipping', 'Mjolnir', 'was', 'toy', 'Earth', 'when', 'what', 'Odin', 'done', 'angst', ""n't"", 'sappy', 'whiny', 'confused', 'resolved', 'make', 'amends', 'best', 'character', 'movie', 'usually', 'villain', 'Tom', 'Hiddleston', 'Loki', 'show', 'Loki', 'character', 'arc', 'actually', 'movie', 'machinations', 'personal', 'conflict', 'are', 'engaging', 'risk', 'being', 'geeky', 'Loki', 'Batman', 'Gambit-', 'maneuvering', 'people', 'events', 'exploiting', 'everyone', 'natures', 'do', 'what', 'only', 'problem', 'initially', 'place', 'doing', 'things', 'appear', 'contradict', 'goals', 'even', 'then', 'clues', 'what', 'going', 'payoff', 'delivers.Thor', 'lifelong', 'friends', 'Warriors', 'Three-', 'identify', 'themselves-', 'are', 'kind', 'one-dimensional', 'cartoonish', 'then', 'were', 'often', 'portrayed', 'way', 'comics', 'only', 'one', 'buddies', 'measure', 'characterization', 'Sif', 'obvious', 'reason', 'may', 'still', 'end', 'up', 'potential', 'love', 'interest.Thor', 'right', 'notes', 'should', 'be', 'first', 'blockbuster', 'year', 'everything', 'supposed', 'hungry', 'more-', 'i.e.', 'Captain', 'America', 'XMen', 'First', 'Class', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'wait']",N/A

I also like that his comics were written with him speaking like a Norseman of old...It was different and set him apart from other Super Heroes.My 2 biggest worries were how Marvel would make Thor sound, and could they produce special effects that were worthy of the Might Thor. I believe they succeeded in both areas. Chris Hemsworth has not only the physique to play Thor, he had the voice...his accent gives that added touch to Thor. Marvel also succeeded in the special effects at reproducing what we have seen Thor doing in comics and on his short lived cartoon program. Scenes like him spinning his hammer while hovering up in the air looked so real (in the real of the movie).Lastly, on the BD the 7.1 sound is fantastic!

Odin even sends the mighty hammer down on Earth in a stone much like in ""Sword in the Stone"" where only that worthy person can obtain the hammer, Thor falls in love with a scientist named Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) where she teaches him things he might soon learn about. His half-brother Loki (Tom Hiddleson) has plans like terrorizing the people on Earth and taking over Asguard as the new leader, when Thor's 4 friends (Ray Stevenson, Tanabou Asandu, Jaime Alexander and Josh Dallas) hear about this they head to Earth to warn Thor but can the god of thunder learn what it means to be a true hero?An outstanding and worthy companion in the Avengers-Marvel saga as it started with the prequel ""Captain America"" and ends with this movie as the final piece of the linking puzzle that leads to the excellent ""Avengers"" movie. This fantasy-adventure is a nice throwback to those wonderful 80s fantasy epics like ""Willow"", ""Conan 1 & 2"", ""Heavy Metal"", ""Excalibur"", ""Clash of the Titans"" and others. The acting is great as is the special effects that make Asguard look fantastic as if you were transported to that magical world and the storytelling is great as well as it follows the comics nicely. The film co-stars Samuel L Jackson, Colm Ferroee and Rene Russo, director Kenneth Brangh who is one of the most acclaimed directors around has brought some shakespearian opera level drama to this movie and a great sense of fun as it was something different for him. I should say if you are know the chronology to The Avengers movies then start with Captain America, Iron Man, Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2 and finally this to link the story that leads up to the best Marvel film ever made.This Blu-Ray contains absolute crystal picture and theater quality sound as it makes the movie come alive and the extras are good like commentary, 7 featurettes, Road to Avengers: Behind the Scenes quick featurette, 11 deleted scenes, an amusing Marvel short film and teaser/trailer.",5,Excellent fantasy epic and a great final piece of the Avengers puzzle,1337126400,"05 16, 2012",2012,2322,"['magical', 'mystical', 'realms', 'Asguard', 'where', 'Norse', 'legends', 'are', 'told', 'brave', 'arrogant', 'warrior', 'named', 'Thor', 'Chris', 'Hensworth', 'caused', 'ruckus', 'realm', 'making', 'father', 'Odin', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'upset', 'indeed', 'so', 'mad', 'father', 'Asguard', 'Earth', 'where', 'mortal', 'man', 'who', 'will', 'learn', 'humility', 'punishment', 'Odin', 'even', 'mighty', 'hammer', 'down', 'Earth', 'stone', 'much', 'Sword', 'Stone', 'where', 'only', 'worthy', 'person', 'can', 'obtain', 'hammer', 'Thor', 'love', 'scientist', 'named', 'Jane', 'Foster', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'where', 'things', 'might', 'soon', 'learn', 'half-brother', 'Loki', 'Tom', 'Hiddleson', 'plans', 'terrorizing', 'people', 'Earth', 'taking', 'over', 'Asguard', 'new', 'leader', 'when', 'Thor', '4', 'friends', 'Ray', 'Stevenson', 'Tanabou', 'Asandu', 'Jaime', 'Alexander', 'Josh', 'Dallas', 'hear', 'head', 'Earth', 'warn', 'Thor', 'can', 'god', 'thunder', 'learn', 'what', 'be', 'true', 'hero', 'outstanding', 'worthy', 'companion', 'Avengers-Marvel', 'saga', 'started', 'prequel', 'Captain', 'America', 'movie', 'final', 'piece', 'linking', 'puzzle', 'excellent', 'Avengers', 'movie', 'fantasy-adventure', 'nice', 'throwback', 'wonderful', '80s', 'fantasy', 'epics', 'Willow', 'Conan', '1', '2', 'Heavy', 'Metal', 'Excalibur', 'Clash', 'Titans', 'others', 'acting', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'make', 'Asguard', 'look', 'fantastic', 'were', 'transported', 'magical', 'world', 'storytelling', 'great', 'as', 'well', 'comics', 'nicely', 'film', 'co-stars', 'Samuel', 'L', 'Jackson', 'Colm', 'Ferroee', 'Rene', 'Russo', 'director', 'Kenneth', 'Brangh', 'who', 'one', 'most', 'acclaimed', 'directors', 'brought', 'shakespearian', 'opera', 'level', 'drama', 'movie', 'great', 'sense', 'fun', 'was', 'something', 'different', 'should', 'say', 'are', 'know', 'chronology', 'Avengers', 'movies', 'then', 'start', 'Captain', 'America', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'finally', 'link', 'story', 'best', 'Marvel', 'film', 'ever', 'made.This', 'Blu-Ray', 'contains', 'absolute', 'crystal', 'picture', 'theater', 'quality', 'sound', 'movie', 'come', 'alive', 'extras', 'are', 'good', 'commentary', '7', 'featurettes', 'Road', 'Avengers', 'Scenes', 'quick', 'featurette', '11', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'amusing', 'Marvel', 'short', 'film', 'teaser/trailer']",N/A

Consequently, I should forget filing a future Mensa membership application. So be it. The movie probably lacks that precious moralistic profundity the Academy Award Committee purports to seek in its cinematic viewings. Nevertheless, I found it intelligent, competent, engrossing, AND respectful of its source material - namely Stan Lee's interpretation of Norse Mythology.""Thor"" is not a mindless fantasy romp. It addresses various themes such as simmering sibling rivalry, filial fealty, overweening presumption and haughtiness that comes with power, resentment, self-sacrifice, and the wisdom of self-restraint. The overbearing, overreaching warrior Thor is thrust upon the road to humble self-redemption, and what better place to do so than upon an unassuming New Mexico hamlet on Midgard. Perhaps a tad too quickly (but that's all right), he learns of a warrior's, a god's, a being's true worth - forgiveness (of Loki's tortured treachery) and self-sacrifice (to protect Jane, her friends, and the New Mexico town) from the Destroyer juggernaut. In short, I found ""Thor"" ultimately uplifting.Flaws do exist. Occasionally the luscious, staggering Asgardian and cosmic backgrounds seemed like scale-model work. Thor becomes acclimated to Midgard customs a bit too easily; more ""Fish Out of Water"" encounters would have rectified this. Some of the S.H.I.E.L.D. security personnels' behavior was implausibly lenient. Nevertheless, ""Thor"" serves as a more than adequate introduction to the God of Thunder and Lightning, the devious but surprisingly conflicted God of Mischief and Evil Loki, the imperious but circumspect Asgardian lord Odin, the Asgardian dimension (NOT planet) and the richness of Norse mythology. It takes itself seriously enough, but not too seriously, because it's a rollicking, energetic adventure, too.Furthermore, the very last end credit whetted my appetite for ""The Avengers"" movie.

1324809,A3VY0Y0J93ZO59,B0034G4P80,"Jonathan Hansen ""Random Scribe""","[4, 6]","So, this isn't exactly the Mighty Thor comic book hero I used to read as a kid.  But Doctor Strange wasn't here either.  As representative offspring of the Norwegian immigrant population, I'm pleased to see one of the old heroes on the silver screen.  And despite the 965 A.D. date scripted to the war of the Frost Giants, that story really does have Ice Age roots.  Maybe even 10,965 B.C. if one considers M'jolnir was reputedly a stone hammer.  And like other myths, it became 'forged' after the Iron Age re-telling and possibly before the birth of Norse written language.How admirably have the producers inducted a stone age myth into the 21st century?  I could have sworn that that New Mexico opening footage was about to insert theme music from the X-Files.  And the government security agency which moved in and surrounded Mjolnir could have been borrowed from Chis Carter's efforts as well.  It's refreshing to see the Marvel Comics adaptation of Cellular and WiFi technology and laptops in their film offerings here. (Devices which didn't exist back when I used to read Thor & Dr. Strange.)  I appreciated it just as much when they released an animated Dr. Strange.  It shows respect to the contemporary audience for their product.Considering that J.R.R. Tolkien borrowed his 'Middle Earth' (in the common tongue) from the Norse, 'Midgard', I see a glimpse of other dimensions of the Marvel multiverse emerging.  There's no Hobbits here, just a reckless immortal who suddenly learns the frailty of mortality, and it's nobility.

As a matter of fact, she didn't even know that Iron Man was a comic book character until I broke it to her today...and she loved both those movies. I know, however, that if she knows that a character in a movie is based off a comic, then she would be apt to not want to participate in its viewing.So, when she told me that she saw a preview of a movie called, ""Thor,"" and wanted to see it, I didn't bother telling her anything of the sort. I simply purchased the tickets and took her to the theater. Guess what? She loved it! And so did I!The Australian actor, Chris Hemsworth, does such an awesome and convincing job as The Mighty Thor from Asgard, that all the exceptional talent surrounding him only brings the picture from already Grade A quality to Grade A+ quality. Natalie Portman was perfectly cast, as was Kat Dennings, Stellan Skarsgard, Rene Russo (as Thor's mother, Frigga), and Tom Hiddleston (as Thor's brother, Loki). And let's not forget the powerful presence of the almost-unrecognizable Sir Anthony Hopkins as Thor's father, King Odin.The arrogant and careless, Thor, is cast out of Asgard and sent to live with humans on earth, where he falls in love, finds compassion and understanding within himself, and becomes the defender of humans.

1324812,A3GRN6J64F2C3X,B0034G4P80,"Joseph P. Menta, Jr.","[3, 5]","I recently saw ""Thor"", and really enjoyed it. It had well-drawn characters, good action, and imaginative production design. I also liked the way that it was sit-up-and-take-notice epic yet also surprisingly intimate. The characters genuinely mattered here, which always makes a summer blockbuster better. With the big summer movies, it's not all about the special effects, and never has been.One thing made me smile, though. In the old ""Thor"" comics, which debuted in the early 1960's, Marvel's story conceit was that, ""hey, you know what-- Thor, Loki, and all the other mythical Norse gods were actually real, and here are new stories about them!"" And the comic book took off, still being published to this day. To my knowledge, no one at Marvel worried, at least with any fervor, that certain groups of people (like Catholics, southern Baptists, devout Jews etc.) might be offended by the notion that the Judeo-Christian God was apparenly being rejected, by a kid's comic book no less, as the only true God out there.Oh, one thing Marvel did eventually do was insert a scene like the following into the comic book every fifty or sixty issues or so:Catholic priest: Thor, thank you for rescuing all our students from their burning school! You're a true hero, even though your very existence flies in the face of the Christian beliefs I hold so dear in my heart!Thor: Verily, thou should not allow thy heart to be troubled, good Father! Thor and his compatriots in noble Asgard have never claimed to be the ultimate forces in the universe. The noble idea of your own Christian God watching us all from above is one that indeed comforts the denizens of Asgard.Catholic priest: (walking away, faith restored) God bless you, Thor!So, you see? At least Marvel threw a small bone to traditional religion by noting that even though the Norse gods were real in Marvel's comic book universe, they didn't claim ultimate supremacy. And that seemed to placate the occasional Marvel editor who presumably was concerned about some kind of backlash from traditional religious quarters, a backlash that never really occured, as far as I know.So, what made me smile in the movie? It seems, almost fifty years after Thor's debut in the comics, now there WAS some genuine worry about offending people with the notion of pagan gods being presented as real beings, or at least as wholesome movie heroes. The movie, you see, goes out of its way to convert the comic book's mystical, magical realm of Asgard, the home of Thor and the Norse gods, into a realm of technological, scientific wonderment instead, with Thor and his compatriots being presented as simply noble, technologically advanced, long-lived beings from another world (albeit with a proclivity for Shakespearean-type dialogue) who were only PERCEIVED as gods when they visited the ancient Norsemen on Earth centuries ago.I mean, it all still works in the movie, and in some ways things are more interesting than they were in the comic book. For example, in the original comics, Bifrost, the majestic, magical Rainbow Bridge that connects Asgard to the physical universe, was just that: a rainbow. Epic, but kind of bland. In the movie, the rainbow bridge is a mighty engineering achievement, crackling with powerful electricity under its ever-churning rainbow coloration, and which connects to a sharp-looking, golden transport chamber, which can shoot Thor and his fellow warriors to any point in the universe. Much more fun.But, yeah, it made me smile that it was probably Hollywood cynicism and fear that for once resulted in better, more interesting story and production elements in the final film. That's not something you see every day.Anyway, Thor is worth a trip to the movies. Its epic grandeur and entertaining, charismatic characters are definitely worth catching on the big screen.",5,Of gods and men,1305072000,"05 11, 2011",2011,3837,"['recently', 'saw', 'Thor', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'had', 'well-drawn', 'characters', 'good', 'action', 'imaginative', 'production', 'design', 'also', 'liked', 'way', 'was', 'sit-up-and-take-notice', 'epic', 'yet', 'also', 'surprisingly', 'intimate', 'characters', 'genuinely', 'mattered', 'here', 'always', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'better', 'big', 'summer', 'movies', 'not', 'special', 'effects', 'never', 'been.One', 'thing', 'made', 'smile', 'though', 'old', 'Thor', 'comics', 'debuted', 'early', '1960', 'Marvel', 'story', 'conceit', 'was', 'hey', 'know', 'what', 'Thor', 'Loki', 'other', 'mythical', 'Norse', 'gods', 'were', 'actually', 'real', 'here', 'are', 'new', 'stories', 'comic', 'book', 'took', 'off', 'still', 'being', 'published', 'day', 'knowledge', 'one', 'Marvel', 'worried', 'least', 'fervor', 'certain', 'groups', 'people', 'Catholics', 'southern', 'Baptists', 'devout', 'Jews', 'etc', 'might', 'be', 'offended', 'notion', 'Judeo-Christian', 'God', 'was', 'apparenly', 'being', 'rejected', 'kid', 'comic', 'book', 'less', 'only', 'true', 'God', 'there.Oh', 'one', 'thing', 'Marvel', 'did', 'eventually', 'do', 'was', 'insert', 'scene', 'following', 'comic', 'book', 'fifty', 'sixty', 'issues', 'so', 'Catholic', 'priest', 'Thor', 'thank', 'rescuing', 'students', 'burning', 'school', ""'re"", 'true', 'hero', 'even', 'very', 'existence', 'flies', 'face', 'Christian', 'beliefs', 'hold', 'so', 'dear', 'heart', 'Thor', 'Verily', 'thou', 'should', 'not', 'allow', 'thy', 'heart', 'be', 'troubled', 'good', 'Father', 'Thor', 'compatriots', 'noble', 'Asgard', 'have', 'never', 'claimed', 'be', 'ultimate', 'forces', 'universe', 'noble', 'idea', 'own', 'Christian', 'God', 'watching', 'one', 'indeed', 'denizens', 'Asgard.Catholic', 'priest', 'walking', 'away', 'faith', 'restored', 'God', 'bless', 'So', 'see', 'least', 'Marvel', 'threw', 'small', 'bone', 'traditional', 'religion', 'noting', 'even', 'Norse', 'gods', 'were', 'real', 'Marvel', 'comic', 'book', 'universe', 'did', ""n't"", 'claim', 'ultimate', 'supremacy', 'seemed', 'placate', 'occasional', 'Marvel', 'editor', 'who', 'presumably', 'was', 'concerned', 'kind', 'backlash', 'traditional', 'religious', 'quarters', 'backlash', 'never', 'really', 'occured', 'as', 'far', 'know.So', 'what', 'made', 'smile', 'movie', 'almost', 'fifty', 'years', 'Thor', 'debut', 'comics', 'now', 'WAS', 'genuine', 'worry', 'offending', 'people', 'notion', 'pagan', 'gods', 'being', 'presented', 'real', 'beings', 'least', 'wholesome', 'movie', 'heroes', 'movie', 'see', 'way', 'convert', 'comic', 'book', 'mystical', 'magical', 'realm', 'Asgard', 'home', 'Thor', 'Norse', 'gods', 'realm', 'technological', 'scientific', 'wonderment', 'instead', 'Thor', 'compatriots', 'being', 'presented', 'simply', 'noble', 'technologically', 'advanced', 'long-lived', 'beings', 'world', 'proclivity', 'Shakespearean-type', 'dialogue', 'who', 'were', 'only', 'PERCEIVED', 'gods', 'when', 'visited', 'ancient', 'Norsemen', 'Earth', 'centuries', 'ago.I', 'mean', 'still', 'movie', 'ways', 'things', 'are', 'more', 'interesting', 'were', 'comic', 'book', 'example', 'original', 'comics', 'Bifrost', 'majestic', 'magical', 'Rainbow', 'Bridge', 'Asgard', 'physical', 'universe', 'was', 'just', 'rainbow', 'Epic', 'kind', 'bland', 'movie', 'rainbow', 'bridge', 'mighty', 'engineering', 'achievement', 'crackling', 'powerful', 'electricity', 'ever-churning', 'rainbow', 'coloration', 'sharp-looking', 'golden', 'transport', 'chamber', 'can', 'shoot', 'Thor', 'fellow', 'warriors', 'point', 'universe', 'Much', 'more', 'fun.But', 'yeah', 'made', 'was', 'probably', 'Hollywood', 'cynicism', 'fear', 'once', 'resulted', 'better', 'more', 'interesting', 'story', 'production', 'elements', 'final', 'film', 'not', 'something', 'see', 'day.Anyway', 'Thor', 'trip', 'movies', 'epic', 'grandeur', 'entertaining', 'charismatic', 'characters', 'are', 'definitely', 'worth', 'catching', 'big', 'screen']",N/A

And I remember 2011 well; mainly because I expected Captain America to be better than Thor. Captain America was a good movie, but after viewing Thor for the first time, I had to go back and read some of the comics. Yes, as an adaptation and a  movie, Thor delivers all the goods.Thor stars Chris Hemsworth as the man himself, with a supporting cast that consists of:  Anthony Hopkins,  Kat Dennings, Idris Elba, Natalie Portman, Jamie Alexander, to name a few. Also starring in the villainous role, Tom Hiddleston playing Loki. I won' t say he stole the show; only because I feel each person played his/her part well, but he did a really awesome job playing Loki. Between Tom Hiddleston, Michael Fassbender, and Benedict Cumberbatch, I simply can't decide who plays the better villain. But the acting in Thor is great.The set designs and costumes/makeup in Thor (example: Frost Giants) were well drawn/set up. And the CGI is pretty good as well.The story is also well executed. It is not as complex as one might think , so it is easy to enjoy, not just for the eye candy ladies (and you too gentlemen) but because Thor does justice not just to Thor the hero, but to Thor as the god of thunder.If you like movies with superheroes and you have not yet seen Thor, go watch it.

1324828,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B0034G4P80,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[6, 11]","The summer of 2011 could easily be known as ""The Summer of Heroes"" (especially superheroes) with the likes of ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" and ""X-Men: First Class"" gracing the silver screen. But before any of those heroes made their triumphant arrival in theaters, the summer was kicked off to the thunderous release of the box office hit, ""Thor"".After an impulsive act of violence jeopardizes the sanctity of Asgard, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is stripped of his power and banished, by his father, Odin (Anthony Hopkins), to Earth. There he encounters the lovely Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), and realizes that there is more to life than glorious battles alongside his fellow Asgardians. With Thor out of the way, his step-brother Loki puts into motion a plan that threatens to destroy all Thor holds dear in Asgard and on Earth. With time running out Thor must prove to be worthy of the power he wielded and once more command the fury of the storm.Of all the comic book characters that Marvel has either already adapted for feature films or have announced plans to do so, Thor seemed the most audacious as he is hardly one of their most recognizable comic staples to the general public. Not to mention, the choice of Kenneth Branagh, an actor and director known for his Shakespearean background, didn't seem an ideal fit for bringing the mystical realm of Asgard to life on the big screen.However, after viewing this outstanding summer blockbuster, I must say that Marvel's bold choices paid off brilliantly. Not only is Thor fast-becoming a household name, but Kenneth Branagh proved to be a truly inspired choice for director. No doubt thanks to his Shakespearean roots, Branagh successfully envisioned a nearly perfect blend of the fantastic elements of Asgard, with the realism (or hyperrealism) that has been established in Marvel Studios' previous film releases with which this movie is connected.Written by the writing duo of Ashley Miller and Zack Stenz (""X-Men: First Class""), alongside Don Payne (""Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer""), and based on a story from comic book and film scribe J. Michael Stracyznski (""Changeling"") and Mark Protosevich (""I Am Legend""), the story for ""Thor"" is epic in scope (much larger than most first-attempt comic book adaptations ever dare), featuring incredible action, unforgettable characters, with plenty of drama, intensity, a budding romance, and even some comedy to boot.Another apparent stroke of genius for this film was the casting, which was spot-on in nearly every instance. Leading the assemblage of characters is relative newcomer (to our shores anyway) Chris Hemsworth as the thunderer himself, Thor. Chris portrays Thor with such bravado, arrogance, and a seemingly unshakable desire for battle that exactly matches his early comic book days.It is also worth mentioning that upon Thor's exile to Earth, Chris slowly brings out a softer side to the demoted god of thunder. Naturally conveying Thor's gradual embracing of humility and an understanding that violence isn't always the best solution.With these two distinct sides to the character, we are left with a very well-rounded and believable hero of mythic proportions that feels much more real than I had ever expected.Alongside, Thor is his step-brother Loki played to absolute perfection by Tom Hiddleston (""The Gathering Storm""). Loki has always been portrayed as a villainous character that went from harmless mischief to ultimately succumbing to his darker side due to his growing contempt for Thor.In the film, Tom plays Loki as mischievous, but not completely evil (at least not yet). His actions though malicious in nature at times, are laced with an underlying desire for approval from those around him. In my opinion, this more deep-seeded emotional drive behind Loki's actions allowed for the character to be much more relatable and intriguing to the audience.Rounding out the primary characters featured in this film is actress Natalie Portman (""Black Swan"") as Jane Foster. Some have criticized Natalie's role as being merely the damsel-in-distress. Or that she portrayed the character as head-over-heels in love with a man she's barely just met, rather than a mature woman with an infatuation. Personally, I disagree on both counts.I felt that Natalie's role was decently fleshed out, albeit not as much as some of the other main characters, but that's where a sequel can come in handy. After all, this was really Thor's movie, and it was pivotal to not only this film, but the impending ""Avengers"" that audiences really come to know and understand him (which seems obvious to me). So, in that regard, some side characters were left slightly short-handed in the story department, but I never felt she was there merely for the damsel role or to be just eye candy.As for the relationship between Thor and Jane, I felt it was handled naturally as both characters showed they liked each other and that it was merely an infatuation at the moment. Neither played it anything beyond that, as some other critics have stated. As for how Jane acted around Thor; Natalie played her as clearly with a new crush, and it felt very believable. To see the relationship as anything else is reading too much into it at this point.But I digress. I must mention that there is a plethora of supporting roles in this film, several of which merit a mention, but to do so for each of them would take quite some time. So, let me be succinct by saying that almost every single one of the supporting players delivers great performances.Each of the supporting cast members brought something different to strengthen the creative process of moviemaking. Plus, in several instances some of them provided brief moments of much-needed levity to break up the intensity and drama unfolding within the story.Those supporting cast members that are clearly worthy of mentioning due to their importance to the story and/or excellent work in the film are: Kat Dennings (""Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist"") as Jane's college assistant Darcy (and a major source of the aforementioned levity), Ray Stevenson (""Punisher: War Zone"") as Volstagg, a member of Asgard's esteemed Warriors Three, and Idris Elba (""The Losers"") as Heimdall, guardian of the Bifrost Bridge.Lastly, two pivotal roles in the film that don't receive a ton of screen time, yet were incredibly vital, are the roles of Odin and SHIELD agent Coulson, played by Sir Anthony Hopkins (""The Silence of the Lambs"") and Clark Gregg (""Iron Man 2"") respectively.Sir Anthony Hopkins was the ideal choice to play Odin, Thor's father and Lord of Asgard. Anthony always elevates any project he's involved in due to his incredible acting prowess, his almost regal demeanor, and the respect that he clearly commands from those around him. For Odin, Anthony brought all of these qualities to bear, and crafted a performance that is worthy of the king of the god-like Asgardians.Actor Clark Gregg, whose character Agent Coulson, has become a staple of Marvel's feature films, once again steals almost every scene in which he appears. Clark's portrayal of Coulson is so entertaining to watch because in one scene he will appear affable and potentially a push-over, but then he will establish himself as an authority figure with a quiet strength to back it up.It is this dichotomy within Agent Coulson that has allowed this potentially one-dimensional character to have such staying power. Plus, he has grown, developed, and become even more interesting every time we meet him in these films.Now, beyond having a terrific story, director and cast, the film also boasted some truly spectacular visual effects sequences. From Asgard's majestic golden spires to the subtly multi-colored Bifrost Bridge (or Rainbow Bridge as it is sometimes referred) to the menacing Frost Giants, every supernatural or fantastical aspect of this film was rendered with such detail and precision that it literally blew away all of my expectations. Every frame looked as if it had been pulled directly from the comic book into amazing reality.This movie featured Hollywood movie magic at its finest, and the quality on display played a significant role in the believability of the film. Bravo to all involved in the creation of the picture-perfect imagery that blended seamlessly with the live actors and physical sets and backgrounds.So, if you haven't figured it out by now, ""Thor"" is an incredibly entertaining blockbuster film and a terrific way to kick off the summer movie season. Even for those moviegoers that aren't aware of the particulars for this character, I believe there is still plenty for you to enjoy in this film. This movie is definitely a must-see.""Thor"" is rated PG-13 for violence.",5,A Thunderous Way to Start the Summer...,1307145600,"06 4, 2011",2011,8728,"['summer', '2011', 'could', 'easily', 'be',

But why I was really excited was the fact it was going to be a Marvel Studios made movie, and they tend to be very selective about their directors and main actors.  Really did you think Iron Man was going to be as good as it was when it first came out?  And I thought The Incredible Hulk was pretty good, at least much better than the first version.  I thought Thor was really well done.  Kenneth Branagh's Shakespearian background was evident throughout the movie.  It had the right dramatic and subtle touches, all befitting the Norse Gods.  While I thought Chris Hemsworth, Sir Anthony Hopkins and Natalie Portman were sincere and awesome, I thought the skill and subtlety of Tom Hiddleston was amazing.  Unless you read the comic books, which I didn't, in the movie, you see what looks like overt support and respect Loki has for Thor but Tom Hiddleston plays it perfectly by ever so slightly giving you the sense that it's not all as it seems with Loki.  And then there was Idris Elba as Heimdall.  I've never seen him before, but I do look forward to seeing him again in Thor 2 (at least I really hope so).  Heimdall isn't a big part but it's an important one and I really thought Idris Elba played it so well that he made the role even more prominent.  You're wondering why I didn't give Thor 5 stars.  Well, I loved the movie but two things stopped me from giving it five stars.  One, I felt it should have taken a little more to turn Thor from an uncaring, arrogant God to a wiser, more benevolent God.  I mean it just seemed all too fast and easy, it really should be harder than that.  The second thing was the relationship between Thor and Jane Foster.  I think that should have been developed more as well.  At the end everyone saids that Thor really missed Jane Foster, but while I know there was a connection beginning there, I didn't feel like it was ever strong enough for him to miss her like that.  Other than that, the story was coherent and well written, it was well acted, it moved right along and well directed.  I'm looking forward to Thor 2 and the Avengers.",4,Worth the Wait,1314403200,"08 27, 2011",2011,2588,"['must', 'have', 'waited', 'what', 'felt', 'lifetime', 'movie', 'come', 'out', 'was', 'well', 'wait', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'one', 'movie', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'directed', 'was', 'Frankenstein', 'think', 'came', 'out', 'more', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'decent', 'enough', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'one', 'movie', 'Star', 'Trek', 'maybe', '6', '7', 'minutes', 'thought', 'did', 'really', 'well', '7', 'minutes', 'relative', 'unknown', 'Between', 'two', 'thought', 'should', 'be', 'least', 'interesting', 'movie', 'why', 'was', 'really', 'excited', 'was', 'fact', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'Marvel', 'Studios', 'made', 'movie', 'tend', 'be', 'very', 'selective', 'directors', 'main', 'actors', 'Really', 'did', 'think', 'Iron', 'Man', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'was', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'thought', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'least', 'much', 'better', 'first', 'version', 'thought', 'Thor', 'was', 'really', 'well', 'done', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'Shakespearian', 'background', 'was', 'evident', 'movie', 'had', 'right', 'dramatic', 'subtle', 'touches', 'befitting', 'Norse', 'Gods', 'thought', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'Sir', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'were', 'sincere', 'awesome', 'thought', 'skill', 'subtlety', 'Tom', 'Hiddleston', 'was', 'amazing', 'read', 'comic', 'books', 'did', ""n't"", 'movie', 'see', 'what', 'overt', 'support', 'respect', 'Loki', 'Thor', 'Tom', 'Hiddleston', 'perfectly', 'ever', 'so', 'slightly', 'giving', 'sense', 'not', 'Loki', 'then', 'was', 'Idris', 'Elba', 'Heimdall', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'do', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'again', 'Thor', '2', 'least', 'really', 'hope', 'so', 'Heimdall', ""n't"", 'big', 'part', 'important', 'one', 'really', 'thought', 'Idris', 'Elba', 'played', 'so', 'well', 'made', 'role', 'even', 'more', 'prominent', ""'re"", 'wondering', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'Thor', '5', 'stars', 'Well', 'loved', 'movie', 'two', 'things', 'stopped', 'giving', 'five', 'stars', 'One', 'felt', 'should', 'have', 'taken', 'little', 'more', 'turn', 'Thor', 'uncaring', 'arrogant', 'God', 'wiser', 'more', 'benevolent', 'God', 'mean', 'just', 'seemed', 'too', 'fast', 'easy', 'really', 'should', 'be', 'harder', 'second', 'thing', 'was', 'relationship', 'Thor', 'Jane', 'Foster', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'developed', 'more', 'as', 'well', 'end', 'everyone', 'saids', 'Thor', 'really', 'missed', 'Jane', 'Foster', 'know', 'was', 'connection', 'beginning', 'there', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'ever', 'strong', 'enough', 'miss', 'Other', 'story', 'was', 'coherent', 'well', 'written', 'was', 'well', 'acted', 'moved', 'right', 'along', 'well', 'directed', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'Thor', '2', 'Avengers']",N/A

Although King Odin had brought peace to the Universe, the bad guys were still waiting to get revenge.  Right before Thor can be pronounced King, the bad guys attack.  The King forbids Thor to go after them, but he disobeys and is banished to earth, where he meets Natalie.Of course, the plot thickens and we learn of the lies and deception from power hungry beings.  Sir Anthony Hopkins plays an outstanding role throughout the movie(as always) as King Odin.  Renee Russo (whom you may remember from the Lethal Weapon flicks) plays the Queen.This is an inter-planetary action plot with lots of action scenes (fighting/blowing up).  The CGI is awesome!

DVD is awesome but my 32"" TV just can't do the movie's grandeur justice.Oh and before you ask, YES I am a huge fan of the comic books, and read Thor quite often. I think, what this film did best, was to take Thor off the pages of the comics, and place him on the big screen with (and this is important) true realism.Okay, stop scratching your heads. What I mean is, I know its a fantasy but the filmmakers spared no expense to make it all seem ...real. Yes, there are changes from the book to the movie, but these are natural.Most notably is the inclusion of a multi-ethnic cast. Changing the ethnicity of some of the characters was genius. It made it seem more true to life.The costumes are another big chance from book to movie. Hollywood has gotten the message, yellow spandex doesn't work on film. No yellow spandex here. All the costumes are more armor-like, and give a nod to their comic book origins. The sets are spectacularly detailed. Even something as far-fetched as the ""rainbow bridge"" was made perfectly and felt true to the books while maintaining a sense of reality. This movie is action packed, some laughs at just the right moments, good solid story, and great cast. The directing is clean and very clear. Even if you have never read a page of the comic book, you will not get lost or feel left out.If I had to give one complaint to this otherwise perfect movie, it would be in the DVD itself. There is no long, behind the scenes, ""making of"" Thor bonus on here. There is a very short Avengers tease, but that's it. This DVD needs a full 2 hour making of segment.

1324848,A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2,B0034G4P80,"Kevin L. Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[2, 5]","This film has everything you'd expect in a comic book film directed by Kenneth Branagh: style, humor, surprises, and a dash of low-key romance.  It uses its source to create a story rich in nuance and imagery.  Unlike Bryan Singer, who muted the X-Men's look, Branagh skillfully uses Marvel Comics' bright primary colors for a refined palette; and unlike Richard Donner, who rendered Superman cartoony, Branagh's Thor actually looks elegant.As pretty grad student Jane Foster studies astronomical phenomena in rural New Mexico, an unexplained aurora dumps a man, seemingly unhurt, into an impact crater.  A ""satellite"" crashes nearby.  Apparently the man is Thor, god of thunder, exiled for arrogance and recklessness, and the satellite is his hammer, Mjolnir, which he can retrieve when he proves himself worthy.  But like all headstrong boys, he won't wait; he wants recognition NOW!Back in Asgard, Thor's brother Loki engages in risky political maneuvers when his father Odin collapses.  As the only remaining heir, Loki claims Odin's throne; but he also enters a strange d&eacute;tente with Laufi, king of the Frost Giants.  Thor's comrades in arms, despairing of Loki's reason, seize the moment.  But these Norse legends' presence on Earth brings Jane Foster and the human race a whole new set of problems.As the latest prequel to Marvel's upcoming Avengers movie, this film sets the stage well; but it also stands on its own.  Its soaring, majestic Asgard makes a remarkable setting for scenes of epic battle, while Thor's sojourn on Earth makes an interesting contrast: New Mexico appears blasted, leached of all color.  Branagh's SFX scenes integrate digital images into a gritty real-world setting without distracting, or making reality look dingy.Though it's easy for critics like Anthony Lane to throw stones, Branagh makes a ""mere"" comic book film into art.  He presents a gripping story, complicated characters, a plausible quest, and a visual canvas that's just pleasing to look at.  I laughed at sudden, unexpected moments, and I cried, especially at the tension between Chris Hemsworth's Thor and Anthony Hopkins's Odin.

The realm of Asgard was superbly detailed and the characters seemed ""believable"" there. I did not expect to be blown away by the cinematography. Chris Hemsworth was excellent; Anthony Hopkins, as usual, was wonderful; Loki seemed a wonderful character. (I never read the comic series, so forgive my ignorance as to how the movie compares to the real thing)Unfortunately, the ""action"" moved to Earth Realm.  That's where Hollywood is and where every movie has to have trite, boring, boilerplate dialogue.  And a totally UNbelieavable heroine/love interest.  There was no chemistry at all between the two characters, Portman was terrible in this role, and honestly - the movie would have been better without that entire setup because it simply did not work.  Did a different person write and produce the Earth Portion??I watched this on Amazon streaming video, on a big plasma set and the picture was excellent. I doubt I'd pay to buy the Blu Ray disk. It was worth the $1.99 I paid to rent it, but Portman and the Earth Realm Dialogue really ruined an otherwise fine, fine movie.

1324857,A3M9ULK9QECAMX,B0034G4P80,K.I.B.,"[29, 152]","When it became clear that Hollywood was going to try to make a movie out of every major Marvel comic character, my opinion was that they would all be mediocre to bad.  I always thought that the best adaptation would have to be Thor, because the visuals necessary to create Asgard would have to be spectacular.  In 2011's Thor, starring some guy who doesn't do a good job playing Thor as Thor, Asgard is pretty cool looking, but nothing special.  Everything else about this film is stupid crap marketed towards the stupidest of the stupid, aka, the general movie-going public.Pretty much everything about this movie is terrible, but here are my key points:(1) LOKI - Loki, whether the Norse myth Loki or the Marvel villain Loki, is supposed to be MISCHIEVOUS.  He shape shifts, disappears, plays both sides, plays pranks, hides and steals things.  Primarily he is the shallow foil to Thor's heroics.  In the movie, he is brooding and whiny.  He quietly contemplates and is jealous of Thor.  The comic book has always shown him to be quite flamboyant and flippant, almost resembling the Joker.  Here he is like a despondent teenager.  This movie got Loki completely wrong.(2) THOR - Thor should be slightly stupid, the type of hero so committed to being a hero that he comes across as a simpleton.  Above all, he should possess medieval chivalry that seems out of place in modern times.  Here he is like a supermodel whose come to be cool, look good, and save the planet or something.(3).  VILLAINS - Villains are as important as the superhero in comic book movies; who are the villains in Thor?  Is it Loki? I hope not because half the time they are getting along, and Loki is really really bad at being Loki, so that doesn't work.  Is it the ice giants?  Well, they are gone after the first battle, so it ain't them.  What about the Destroyer? Well, that is really just a mindless weapon of the Asgardians used against Thor in a brief and bland battle.  NO VILLAIN IN A COMIC BOOK MOVIE?!?!?! Yep, you heard that.(4) THE ROMANCE - Natalie Portman really just serves as a prop in this movie. These movies, because of the formula to sell tickets and not hurt the brains of the morons seeing them, NEED a love interest.  Portman serves as a piece of meat to make sure that Thor doesn't end without Thor kind of falling in love.  Everything out of her mouth is some sort of sassy comment that Thor, whose been on the planet for a few hours, really shouldn't be able to understand.  Also, Thor's transition from fallen-from-the-skies god to sensitive human is way to brief and undeveloped.I could go on forever, but I'll end saying this.  I left the theater surrounded by a large crowd of people who clearly thought this movie was awesome.  I do not think that was their own opinion.  I think what has occurred is they've been trained like dogs to like just about anything that is waved in front of their face in a familiar fashion.  ""Ohhh, we are at a comic book movie.  Comics are familiar, I like comics.  Boy, this is good. I can't wait to see Captain America.

I was a little bit afraid that my own experience with the original might make it difficult for me to like the film adaption.  However, I actually did enjoy this film. I think Kenneth Branagh did a good job overall in this adaption, not a fantastic job mind you, but a good job. The movie does feel like a real honest-to-goodness Thor movie.I wasn't sure what Asgard might look like in the live film compared to Kirby's cosmic splendors of the kingdom, but I did like the design and effects for the city of Asgard, so it worked for me.  Btw, I also really loved the costumes. As for the script, I liked it although Odin's last remarks weren't anything that was illuminating or surprising.On the actresses and actors:  some of the quality of acting isn't up to what it should be.  However, I really enjoyed Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston as Thor and Loki and thought they were both good choices for their parts.  I was also delighted to see the Warriors Three in the film. However, I wasn't as happy about the lack of content and development for their characters: Hogan (Tadanobu Asano) really has  nothing to say or talk about, Volstagg (Ray Stevenson) is not quite as weighty and as buffoonish as the rolling comic mass from the comic books (but that's okay), and Fandral (Joshua Dallas) doesn't have enough time or witty dialogue to bring forth his genuine swashbuckling mirth. The selection of those three, however, still made me happy that these characters were in the film and wish there were more time spent developing/deepening their personalities. I really liked Jaimie Alexander's Sif (hubba-hubba), but again we hardly get a chance to spend much time with them.Odin (Anthony Hopkins) voice seemed too soft and mild for me.  I always imagined Odin with a more bombastic or booming voice.  Ah well.Natalie Portman wasn't very interesting as Jane Foster -- but, as I recall it, Jane Foster in the comic book wasn't very interesting either.  The other actor (Stellan Skarsgrd) and actress (Kat Dennings) seem to be in it only for the ride, and so they had very little drama or content to grasp in order to act out anything interesting in any manner or form.I gave the film three-out-of-five stars.

1324866,AIRCASSWQRZDT,B0034G4P80,Kolwynia,"[464, 533]","Thor is Marvel's best superhero movie yet.  It is even better than the first Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk films.  It is also the most visually stunning of any Marvel film, with gorgeous fantasy settings, great costumes, and spectacular special effects.In the same way as Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight worked just as well as a crime drama as a superhero movie, Thor works just as well as a standalone fantasy film.  Even if I had not known that I was watching a comic book movie, I would have been just as happy with the story.  In fact, I would say that you don't actually need to be familiar with the characters or the comic mythology to enjoy the film.The story is set half in Asgard, the realm of the gods, and half in our world, Earth.  Thor, the son of the king of Asgard, the wise Odin, is a proud and arrogant king-in-waiting.  He makes a foolish mistake that brings his world to the brink of war and his father exiles him to our world as punishment, and maybe to teach him how to be a better man.  On Earth, Thor makes some new friends and even begins to fall in love with a pretty scientist.  Meanwhile, in Asgard, his brother Loki begins to put into motion a plot that may threaten Thor's home.Two things about the film really stood out to me.  The first is the absolutely beautiful settings and solid world-building in the movie.  Asgard looks amazing, with settings such as the Rainbow Bridge, a crystal structure with colored lights running through it, spanning a sea that flows into a massive waterfall, cascading down into the open cosmos.  Also, great costuming really makes the gods stand out, and adds to the film's epic feel.  The second thing was the character of Loki, the film's antagonist.  Watching the trailers, I expected a greasy, honorless villain (someone like Wormtongue from the Lord of the Rings).  Instead I got the story of a hero, told in reverse.  Loki's story mirrors his brother Thor's, but where Thor starts out as an arrogant royal brat and through his time on Earth comes to realize what it means to be a hero, Loki begins the story as a mischievous but honorable man, and over the course of the film turns into a really bad guy.  As Thor rises, he falls.  And when his final plan is revealed at the end of the film, it totally fits his personality and everything you know about him.  In other superhero films, we're used to seeing the bad guy go on some kind of mindless rampage at the end of the film.  We saw it in The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man, the Spider Man movies, the Fantastic Four...but not here.  Loki acts like a man with a purpose.  Actually he has two purposes, both very personal to him.  One is to do commit a terrible act of destruction, partly out of self-loathing and partly out of a twisted sense of honor toward his father.  And the other is simply to beat his brother, proving himself Thor's equal.  He is easily the deepest villain of any of the Marvel films so far.The film is directed by Shakespearean actor Kenneth Branagh (Gilderoy Lockhart!), who handles the epic material perfectly.  More than any Marvel film so far, this one focuses on the hero's journey.  Even more than a comic book movie, this is a fantasy film about a hero.  Expect father-son drama, palace intrigue in the realm of the gods, and an epic confrontation between two brothers who have been become very different people over the course of the story.  There is also plenty of humor, with a few real laugh-out-loud moments.  And there is a very sweet, almost cute romance woven into the story.  It carries an innocent, young-love kind of feeling.  It also takes the two characters, one a god more concerned with war and glory, the other a scientist more concerned with solving the mysteries of the universe, and brings them down to earth in their budding love for one another.I would recommend Thor to any lover of fantasy films, as well as any fans of comic book movies such as Marvel's Avengers lineup.  It is solid fantasy fun with a strong sense of the epic and the heroic.  And when you see Thor finally wield his hammer and summon the lightning, you'll want to stand up and cheer.",4,"Epic, heroic fantasy.",1304812800,"05 8, 2011",2011,4133,"['Thor', 'Marvel', 'best', 'superhero', 'movie', 'yet', 'even', 'better', 'first', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'films', 'also', 'most', 'visually', 'stunning', 'Marvel', 'film', 'gorgeous', 'fantasy', 'settings', 'great', 'costumes', 'spectacular', 'special', 'effects.In', 'same', 'way', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'worked', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'crime', 'drama', 'superhero', 'movie', 'Thor', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'standalone', 'fantasy', 'film', 'Even', 'had', 'not', 'known', 'was', 'watching', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'happy', 'story', 'fact', 'would', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'actually', 'need', 'be', 'familiar', 'characters', 'comic', 'mythology', 'enjoy', 'film.The', 'story', 'set', 'half', 'Asgard', 'realm', 'gods', 'half', 'world', 'Earth', 'Thor', 'son', 'king', 'Asgard', 'wise', 'Odin', 'proud', 'arrogant', 'king-in-waiting', 'foolish', 'mistake', 'world', 'brink', 'war', 'father', 'world', 'punishment', 'maybe', 'teach', 'how', 'be', 'better', 'man', 'Earth', 'Thor', 'new', 'friends', 'even', 'fall', 'love', 'pretty', 'scientist', 'Meanwhile', 'Asgard', 'brother', 'Loki', 'put', 'motion', 'plot', 'may', 'threaten', 'Thor', 'home.Two', 'things', 'film', 'really', 'stood', 'out', 'first', 'absolutely', 'beautiful', 'settings', 'solid', 'world-building', 'movie', 'Asgard', 'amazing', 'settings', 'such', 'Rainbow', 'Bridge', 'crystal', 'structure', 'colored', 'lights', 'running', 'spanning', 'sea', 'massive', 'waterfall', 'cascading', 'down', 'open', 'cosmos', 'Also', 'great', 'costuming', 'really', 'gods', 'stand', 'out', 'film', 'epic', 'feel', 'second', 'thing', 'was', 'character', 'Loki', 'film', 'antagonist', 'Watching', 'trailers', 'expected', 'greasy', 'honorless', 'villain', 'someone', 'Wormtongue', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Instead', 'got', 'story', 'hero', 'told', 'reverse', 'Loki', 'story', 'mirrors', 'brother', 'Thor', 'where', 'Thor', 'out', 'arrogant', 'royal', 'brat', 'time', 'Earth', 'realize', 'what', 'be', 'hero', 'Loki', 'story', 'mischievous', 'honorable', 'man', 'course', 'film', 'really', 'bad', 'guy', 'Thor', 'when', 'final', 'plan', 'revealed', 'end', 'film', 'totally', 'personality', 'everything', 'know', 'other', 'superhero', 'films', ""'re"", 'used', 'seeing', 'bad', 'guy', 'go', 'kind', 'mindless', 'rampage', 'end', 'film', 'saw', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Spider', 'Man', 'movies', 'Fantastic', 'Four', 'not', 'here', 'Loki', 'man', 'purpose', 'Actually', 'two', 'purposes', 'very', 'personal', 'One', 'do', 'commit', 'terrible', 'act', 'destruction', 'partly', 'self-loathing', 'partly', 'twisted', 'sense', 'honor', 'father', 'other', 'simply', 'beat', 'brother', 'proving', 'Thor', 'equal', 'easily', 'deepest', 'villain', 'Marvel', 'films', 'so', 'far.The', 'film', 'directed', 'Shakespearean', 'actor', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'Gilderoy', 'Lockhart', 'who', 'epic', 'material', 'perfectly', 'More', 'Marvel', 'film', 'so', 'far', 'one', 'hero', 'journey', 'Even', 'more', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'fantasy', 'film', 'hero', 'Expect', 'father-son', 'drama', 'palace', 'intrigue', 'realm', 'gods', 'epic', 'confrontation', 'two', 'brothers', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'become', 'very', 'different', 'people', 'course', 'story', 'also', 'plenty', 'humor', 'few', 'real', 'laugh-out-loud', 'moments', 'very', 'sweet', 'almost', 'cute', 'romance', 'woven', 'story', 'innocent', 'young-love', 'kind', 'feeling', 'also', 'two', 'characters', 'one', 'god', 'more', 'concerned', 'war', 'glory', 'other', 'scientist', 'more', 'concerned', 'solving', 'mysteries', 'universe', 'down', 'earth', 'budding', 'love', 'one', 'another.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'Thor', 'lover', 'fantasy', 'films', 'as', 'well', 'fans', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'such', 'Marvel', 'Avengers', 'lineup', 'solid', 'fantasy', 'fun', 'strong', 'sense', 'epic', 'heroic', 'when', 'see', 'Thor', 'finally', 'wield', 'hammer', 'summon', 'lightning', ""'ll"", 'want', 'stand', 'up', 'cheer']",N/A
1324867,A120V3RVSK1O1K,B0034G4P80,K. Ostrowski,"[2, 6]","Originally, I put off seeing this film, and believe it or not, it wasn't because I was afraid it would have elements of paganism in it.  I just didn't like the visual look of the film, from what I'd seen of the trailers, nor did I like some of the casting choices (although Anthony Hopkins as Odin is -fantastic.-)Well, if I had been worried about paganism, I needn't have.  They make it quite clear in this movie that Thor is merely a long-lived alien being with very advanced technology.  In fact, they make it much more clear than in the comics of the same name, and none of the characters ever refer to themselves as ""gods.""Thor is a vain and arrogant warrior, who's spoiling for a fight, even as he's about to be crowned the new king of Asgard.  However, he soon betrays the trust of his father, risking his life and the lives of all his people, and nearly causing a war.  Enraged, his father Odin takes away not only the crown, but his powers and royal station, casting him to Earth in anger, and placing an enchantment on Thor's hammer, so that only those who are worthy may pick it up and weild its power.A fair part of the movie takes place while Thor is de-powered and trying to get his hammer and powers back, or else adjusting to his new life as a human being.  However, in the end, (spoilers) he attempts to sacrifice himself for the people he cares about, and is deemed worthy to weild the hammer once again.One drawback of Thor spending most of the movie without any powers is that it's a bit difficult to tell, if you've never read about the character, just what his powers are, exactly.  This is helped by a big fight early in the film, and another couple of fights near the end, but these are sometimes shot from imperfect angles, or happen a little fast, and it can be difficult to keep track of what, precisely, is going on.However, I was stunned by just how Christian this movie is.  It's not just that it's not a pagan story.  This movie tells the story of mankind from the Christian point of view.  Mortal man begins as a beloved son; an heir, and just as he comes into his inheritance, he makes a foolish decision, chooses to sin against his father, is cast out, and in the end, through self-sacrifice, virtue and the mercy of his father, he is admitted back into his birthright again, although some aren't so fortunate.That brings me to Loki; the villain.  I think he may be the best villain out of any of the movies that Marvel Studios has made.  He begins as not really evil, exactly, and even wanting to protect his kingdom, but as time goes on, and he discovers new things about himself and his people, he becomes desperate, and his good intentions begin taking him down a path of deep evil.  He's so much more complex than someone like the Iron Mongrel, who just wants cash, or Abomination, who's in it for a thrill and an ego trip.  Loki doesn't even go on a rampage, like so many of them do.  He has an evil plan, and he doesn't let on exactly what it is until almost the last second.In a way, I found it hard to get excited about the bad guy because of that last point.  It would be one thing if we understood what Loki was planning from the beginning, and knew what a nasty threat he was, but he doesn't make his evil plot very well understood until rather late in the film, which decreases the tension somewhat.There's a sort of interesting juxtaposition between Thor and Loki as the film progresses; Loki growing more evil and corrupt, and Thor learns the hard lessons that only real life can teach.  It's an interesting way to tell a story, and I was amazed by just how true it rang.I've been told by some that the romance between Thor and Jane Foster felt forced.  To this I reply ""There was a romance?""  I mean, sure, they talk a lot, and they share a kiss at the end, but I wouldn't exactly call it a romance, since it's never terribly romantic, there's really nothing going on between the characters, and nothing of any substance comes of it.  Thor just came off as a decent guy who wanted to help her out, and he did.  That's all I think needs to be said about it.Finally, back to my initial point; by first worry; that the visual look and casting of the movie wasn't what I wanted it to be.  Was that as much of a problem as I thought it would be?Well, honestly, yes.I still don't think Chris Hemsworth is quite big enough to be Thor.  I still don't think Heimdall should have been black.  I still don't think Volstagg was -anywhere near- big enough.  Most importantly, I don't think the technology of Asgard should have looked quite as much like technology as it did.The moment Thor says ""your ancestors called it magic, you call it science,"" I groan.  As much as I may dislike paganism, it's not nearly as much of a threat as it once was.  Secularism is.  I'm fine with them -saying- that Thor is not a god.  They don't need to imply that nothing truly miraculous exists.  These things bother me through nearly every visually-impressive scene in the film.In conclusion, I did like this film.  Rest assured, you won't be drawn into paganism by it, and it might even inspire you to think a little more about the values of love and sacrifice, which is always a good thing to think about.  I wish it had distanced itself a little more from modern, secular skepticism, but it was certainly a better film than I thought it would be.",4,Almost Stunningly Good.

1324871,A356RFKNIG043B,B0034G4P80,K. Swanson,"[3, 4]","3.4 starsI first read Thor in 1970 or so and still think it's one of Jack Kirby's best creations. It's nice to see his name on this in spots instead of Stan ""Me! Me! All Me!"" Lee stealing credit from him or Ditko or etc, as has been usual for decades now. It's Kirby's vision that made those books really worth reading, and still is.This version had me hoping highly, as Branagh's epic-Bard-feel screen rating is usually solid. Sadly, despite some nice moments, I just didn't feel the Thunder God vibe anywhere nearly as much I was hoping to. Hemsworth quite simply doesn't have the gravitas. His acting is abysmal in the first half hour, then gets mildly better; one gets the feeling that Hopkins took him aside and tersely reminded him what acting looks like. Hopkins' Odin is the only role with real edge here, and he gets some strong scenes in. But everyone else left me cold.Loki was nowhere near the scheming prince of darkness he should be, and Thor's buddies had no real oomph either. Portman and Denning are simply weak at best, and the whole love interest thing was handled poorly; the fireside scene is laughable. They should have had some NKOTB playing in the background.The effects get better as the film goes on, but Asgaard is in general a huge disappointment. I had to laugh at how they made Valhalla a big suburb; look at how over-developed the whole area is. It looks like LA! Every square inch is built over with huge apartments. So this is what the Norse Gods earn for their bravery? Levittown in space? Ridiculous.Plus the now-standard quiet dialogue then sudden massive sound effect wall of noise gets worse as the movie goes on; we had to ride the remote the whole movie. Blu-rays need to start coming with a separate non-home theater track for when those of us with neighbors less than a mile away are watching a film after dark. This was simply way too much dynamic range for no real good reason. I used to play electric guitar for a living and even I found this pointlessly loud at moments.Idris Elba had a good feel for the material and seemed one of the few to really grok the original Thor, even in his minor role. Epic, yet understated. No one else but Hopkins had read the source, apparently. But this is Hollywood, after all. Subtlety is almost a cuss word there in these huge CGI blowouts.Speaking of which, the effects have some fine moments, the end of the bridge being the best, but in general the good blu-ray transfer made the plastic costumes and sets all too clearly fake at times. This looks good but could have looked SO much better and more non-Hollywood authentic. As with the script, and most of the acting, and even the direction. Frankly, as a director, Branagh is a fabulous actor.If pecs and abs could act, Hemsworth would be Olivier. But they can't, and he ain't, and as the key to the whole tale he brings this movie down to the realm of merely nice eye candy.A pleasant diversion, but go check out the Kirby originals again and see how truly epic this tale can really be.",3,"Starts weak, improves somewhat, but surely Branagh can do better",1318896000,"10 18, 2011",2011,3023,"['3.4', 'starsI', 'first', 'read', 'Thor', '1970', 'so', 'still', 'think', 'one', 'Jack', 'Kirby', 'best', 'creations', 'nice', 'see', 'name', 'spots', 'instead', 'Stan', 'Me', 'Me', 'Me', 'Lee', 'stealing', 'credit', 'Ditko', 'etc', 'been', 'usual', 'decades', 'now', 'Kirby', 'vision', 'made', 'books', 'really', 'worth', 'reading', 'still', 'is.This', 'version', 'had', 'hoping', 'highly', 'Branagh', 'epic-Bard-feel', 'screen', 'rating', 'usually', 'solid', 'Sadly', 'nice', 'moments', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'Thunder', 'God', 'vibe', 'anywhere', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'was', 'hoping', 'Hemsworth', 'quite', 'simply', ""n't"", 'have', 'gravitas', 'acting', 'abysmal', 'first', 'half', 'hour', 'then', 'mildly', 'better', 'one', 'feeling', 'took', 'aside', 'tersely', 'reminded', 'what', 'acting', 'Hopkins', 'Odin', 'only', 'role', 'real', 'edge', 'here', 'strong', 'scenes', 'everyone', 'else', 'left', 'cold.Loki', 'was', 'nowhere', 'scheming', 'prince', 'darkness', 'should', 'be', 'Thor', 'buddies', 'had', 'real', 'oomph', 'Portman', 'Denning', 'are', 'simply', 'weak', 'best', 'whole', 'love', 'interest', 'thing', 'was', 'handled', 'poorly', 'fireside', 'scene', 'laughable', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'NKOTB', 'playing', 'background.The', 'effects', 'get', 'better', 'film', 'Asgaard', 'general', 'huge', 'disappointment', 'had', 'laugh', 'how', 'made', 'Valhalla', 'big', 'suburb', 'how', 'over-developed', 'whole', 'area', 'LA', 'Every', 'square', 'inch', 'built', 'huge', 'apartments', 'what', 'Norse', 'Gods', 'earn', 'bravery', 'Levittown', 'space', 'now-standard', 'quiet', 'dialogue', 'then', 'sudden', 'massive', 'sound', 'effect', 'wall', 'noise', 'worse', 'movie', 'had', 'ride', 'remote', 'whole', 'movie', 'Blu-rays', 'need', 'start', 'coming', 'separate', 'non-home', 'theater', 'track', 'when', 'neighbors', 'less', 'mile', 'away', 'are', 'watching', 'film', 'dark', 'was', 'simply', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'dynamic', 'range', 'real', 'good', 'reason', 'used', 'play', 'electric', 'guitar', 'living', 'even', 'found', 'pointlessly', 'loud', 'moments.Idris', 'Elba', 'had', 'good', 'feel', 'material', 'seemed', 'one', 'few', 'really', 'grok', 'original', 'Thor', 'even', 'minor', 'role', 'Epic', 'yet', 'understated', 'one', 'else', 'Hopkins', 'had', 'read', 'source', 'apparently', 'Hollywood', 'Subtlety', 'almost', 'cuss', 'word', 'there', 'huge', 'CGI', 'blowouts.Speaking', 'effects', 'have', 'fine', 'moments', 'end', 'bridge', 'being', 'best', 'general', 'good', 'blu-ray', 'transfer', 'made', 'plastic', 'costumes', 'sets', 'too', 'clearly', 'fake', 'times', 'good', 'could', 'have', 'looked', 'SO', 'much', 'better', 'more', 'non-Hollywood', 'authentic', 'script', 'most', 'acting', 'even', 'direction', 'Frankly', 'director', 'Branagh', 'fabulous', 'actor.If', 'pecs', 'abs', 'could', 'act', 'Hemsworth', 'would', 'be', 'Olivier', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ai', ""n't"", 'key', 'whole', 'tale', 'movie', 'down', 'realm', 'merely', 'nice', 'eye', 'candy.A', 'pleasant', 'diversion', 'go', 'check', 'Kirby', 'originals', 'again', 'see', 'how', 'truly', 'tale', 'can', 'really', 'be']",N/A

I could imagine the briefing the director and writers must have had with the studio execs who were rubbing their hands with greed, ordering them to seek out high profile stars (Portman, Hopkins) and some patny creamer of the season so as to put together an ensemble for a movie they can then boost up with immense cgi shots to generate huge profits at the box office. This movie was created by the marketing department. Ok the acting wasnt just bad, it was embarrassing for everyone involved. Portman and Hopkins must either really be hurting for money or just like the producers must have found a very easy way to secure astronomic salaries doing substandard projects. I guess a 50 million dollars a year income is just not enough for Portman.The story itself is so dumb and cheeky and uninspiring, not to mention comatosely boring. No twists, no surprises, no intelligent conversations or thoughts - just trite cliches and banalities delivered right on time with lousy acting and predictable all the way. The ""love story"" was dumb and totally unbelievable as well. I dont see how these people could fall in love. They never exchange one intelligent sentence. Their ""conversations"" consist of Thor grunting a line, flexing his muscles or reciting some dumb poetic line shoved into his face by the writers, and which I doubt Hemsworth even understands, and Portman looking all dreamy and concerned. This was like watching a bad Michael Bay rip off. I genuinely fail to understand all the good reviews as objectively really this was a bad movie in every way possible. The only reason I can recommend to anyone to waste their time on this piece of junk is to see for themselves just how truly bad it is. I thought I had seen my share of lousy movies but this one tops the list. If i could give it zero stars I would  - but even that would be too generous.",1,"A Dumb, Computer Generated, Cgi Eye-Candy Garbage of the Premium Kind",1326326400,"01 12, 2012",2012,2612,"['movie', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'bad', 'lack', 'more', 'colorful', 'word', 'missed', 'mark', 'utterly', 'pathetically', 'accounts', 'then', 'Thor', 'absolute', 'computer', 'generated', 'cgi-visual', 'eye', 'candy', 'garbage', 'premium', 'kind', 'had', 'finish', 'three', 'sittings', 'couldnt', 'get', 'one', 'plot', 'unbelievable', 'even', 'fantasy', 'super', 'hero', 'movie', 'acting', 'lousy', 'mean', 'LOUSY', 'even', 'Portman', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'have', ""OD'ed"", 'steroids', 'something', 'apparently', 'brain', 'mass', 'have', 'wandered', 'muscles', 'size', 'tree', 'trunks', 'leaving', 'vacuuous', 'moron', 'who', 'intellectual', 'equivalent', 'Disney', 'cruise.Everything', 'movie', 'so', 'painfully', 'right', 'formula', 'wan', 'puke', 'could', 'imagine', 'briefing', 'director', 'writers', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'studio', 'execs', 'who', 'were', 'rubbing', 'hands', 'greed', 'ordering', 'seek', 'out', 'high', 'profile', 'stars', 'Portman', 'Hopkins', 'patny', 'creamer', 'season', 'so', 'put', 'together', 'ensemble', 'movie', 'can', 'then', 'boost', 'up', 'immense', 'cgi', 'shots', 'generate', 'huge', 'profits', 'box', 'office', 'movie', 'was', 'created', 'marketing', 'department', 'acting', 'wasnt', 'just', 'bad', 'was', 'embarrassing', 'everyone', 'involved', 'Portman', 'Hopkins', 'must', 'either', 'really', 'be', 'hurting', 'money', 'just', 'producers', 'must', 'have', 'found', 'very', 'easy', 'way', 'secure', 'astronomic', 'salaries', 'doing', 'substandard', 'projects', 'guess', '50', 'million', 'dollars', 'year', 'income', 'just', 'not', 'enough', 'Portman.The', 'story', 'so', 'dumb', 'cheeky', 'uninspiring', 'not', 'mention', 'comatosely', 'boring', 'twists', 'surprises', 'intelligent', 'conversations', 'thoughts', 'just', 'trite', 'cliches', 'banalities', 'delivered', 'right', 'time', 'lousy', 'acting', 'predictable', 'way', 'love', 'story', 'was', 'dumb', 'totally', 'unbelievable', 'as', 'well', 'dont', 'see', 'how', 'people', 'could', 'fall', 'love', 'never', 'exchange', 'one', 'intelligent', 'sentence', 'conversations', 'consist', 'Thor', 'grunting', 'line', 'flexing', 'muscles', 'reciting', 'dumb', 'poetic', 'line', 'shoved', 'face', 'writers', 'doubt', 'Hemsworth', 'even', 'Portman', 'looking', 'dreamy', 'concerned', 'was', 'watching', 'bad', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'rip', 'off', 'genuinely', 'fail', 'understand', 'good', 'reviews', 'objectively', 'really', 'was', 'bad', 'movie', 'way', 'possible', 'only', 'reason', 'can', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'waste', 'time', 'piece', 'junk', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'truly', 'bad', 'thought', 'had', 'seen', 'share', 'lousy', 'movies', 'one', 'list', 'i', 'could', 'give', 'zero', 'stars', 'would', 'even', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'generous']",N/A

Both leads Chris Hemsworth as Thor, and Tom Hiddleston as Loki, were excellent but it was Tom Hiddleston playing Loki that made the movie for me.  I could not take my eyes off him, his performance was mesmerizing.Both actors were touching, and brought tears to my eyes because the brother's personalities grew in opposite directions.  At first Thor was arrogant and bad, while Loki seemed humble and good, but those roles completely reversed by the finale of the movie and yet I couldn't hate Loki and found myself saying along with Thor, ""Loki no"", when Loki did what he did (I don't want to give it away).The CGI and the costumes are great and so are the fighting and action scenes too.Also, some of the best scenes were cut and are in the deleted scenes section of the Blu-ray disc.  Especially the part where Loki is made King (he didn't steal it, it was bestowed upon him according to the line of succession, but by cutting the scene out of the movie it appeared as though he stole the title).I'm looking forward more to Thor II's release (probably in 2013), rather than the Avengers movie that will be released this summer.

It's difficult to view another Marvel character movie without comparing it.I think I'm going to place Thor just above The Incredible Hulk in terms of enjoyment. From top to bottom (so far) they rank: Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Thor, Incredible Hulk. (I don't count the X-Men movies or Spider-Man as they were made by Fox & Sony)Thor stars Chris Helmsworth (Captain Kirk's father from Star Trek) as the arrogant god who is exiled to earth where he is supposed to learn some humility. On our planet he meets Jane (Natalie Portman) and supposedly falls in love.The biggest drawback for me was the humor. There were funny moments that just felt forced. The first time Thor gets tased is chuckle-worthy; when he gets a shot in his butt in order to control him, I start to cringe. When they recreate the fact that Jane hit him with her car, I rolled my eyes.What I absolutely loved about this movie was the ""villain"". I'm still not sure you could call Thor's brother, Loki, the villain. He is such a complex character in this film. There are plenty of twists and surprises from him as this movie progresses. I thought he was the best part.Once the movie was over, including the anti-climactic scene after the credits, I felt like I had just watched a placeholder for The Avengers movie. I realize Captain America is advertised with that theme, but Thor just didn't pack the punch I was hoping for.I'd give this movie a B-. Loki was superb.

1324961,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B0034G4P80,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[9, 12]","By all rights this movie should be a huge flop.  It's essentially a costume drama set in modern day, a sword- and-sorcery-in-the-stone epic with Thor as Arthur and Mjolnir as Excalibur. But much to my surprise, Thor is a hilarious monster-bashing fish-out-of-water tale with a six-foot-tall chiseled Viking at its center.There's so many things about Thor that shouldn't work but do: he wields a hammer that boomerangs back into his hand, that he can spin at high speed to whip up a whirlwind, that allows him to fly, and that can only be wielded by someone worthy.  This is a hammer we're talking about.There are some concessions to make the film palatable to non-comic fans, but they are surprisingly few.  Thor (chiseled-from-rock Chris Hemsworth) has no alter ego -- although the film takes a stab at creating a hilariously useless cover identity for him that matches his disabled persona in the comics; Asgard is meticulously explained as a highly advanced scientific civilization from the stars; and a considerably diminished Thor returns to Earth.  But everything else - the epaulets, the bright red cloak, the ""forsooth""s and ""thou""s -- are all here in their glorious cheesiness.Director Kenneth Branagh knew exactly what he was doing when he collared Anthony Hopkins as Odin, Rene Russo as Frigga, and Natalie Portman as astrophysicist Jane Foster. Branagh makes Thor palatable by highlighting the very ridiculous nature of it all. Thor gets run over, tasered, and beaten up multiple times to demonstrate that Thor is learning a lesson of humility. And who doesn't want to see a gorgeous white alien (a Nordic?) with bulging muscles get a great big heaping of humble pie?The action flickers back and forth between Asgard where Loki (a sneering Tom Hiddleston) and frost giants plot Asgard's downfall, and Earth where Foster struggles to convince everyone that large, sustainable Einstein-Rosen bridges are real.  This conveniently explains the Bifrost Bridge, because both titles have the word bridge in it.  Although Foster has been upgraded from her role as a nurse in the comics to an astrophysicist in the movie, her scientific contribution is solely to complain about the government taking her analysis equipment, make goo-goo eyes at Thor, and look pretty. If there's a flaw in this movie it's that Foster's relationship with Thor is too brief. It's hard to believe an Asgardian deity would swear to return to defend Earth solely because of one dreamy night spent on a rooftop gazing at the stars. Then again, I just used the words ""hard to believe"" and ""Asgardian deity"" in the same sentence.There are a host of ancillary characters and all of them provide humorous contributions. There's dour Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) who grabs a bow instead of a sniper rifle; warrior maiden Sif (Jaimie Alexander) and the Warriors Three (Josh Dallas as Fandral, Tadanobu Asano as Hogun, and Ray Stevenson as Volstagg) who are described as ""Jackie Chan, Robin Hood, and Xena""; and best of all there's Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings) a political science major intern (""the only one who applied,"" mutters Foster) who knows nothing about Nordic myth and mishears ""Mjolnir"" as ""meow-meow.""  That line still cracks me up.Thor is essentially what happens if a Dungeons & Dragons character walked off a character sheet and stepped onto Earth for a jaunt. I learned a lot about how to correctly pronounce Nordic phrases I've been mispronouncing for two decades, learned absolutely nothing about Einstein-Rosen bridges, and loved every minute of it.

Forbes ""Fool""","[2, 2]","""Thor"" is fairly unique amongst superhero films in that it has multiple characters that are complex in their motivations and experience signifigant character development throughout the course of the film. Most notably this applies to both the hero of the tale, Thor, and the villain, his brother Loki. Both characters start at different places than they finish, and undergo believable character arcs, and Loki's motivations are far more intricate and involved than your typical villain fare, making him far more compelling than your typical world-conquerer or power-grabber. As for the look of Asgard and its inhabitants? A regal fantasy world that remains embedded in your memories. Oh, and of course there's the action in the bits where Thor actually has his hammer (which isn't for most of the movie, surprisingly...).

1324977,A1AFXJ8U72MD6L,B0034G4P80,"MISTER SJEM ""sonofhotpie""","[1, 1]","THOR, based on the graphic novels of old as well as Norse Mythology, was penned as an idea back in 2001 but then went into ""development hell"" for several years before it was moved along into an actual movie for release. And understandably so as the budget for this picture was $150M. Fortunately, THOR's overall box office yielded over $448M as of August 25th of this year so that means there will be a part 2 in July, 2013 (BTW, be sure to watch the end credits for the usual surprise that has Samuel Jackson in it). The special effects are impressive, the acting is above average to good and the overall story, while not brilliant, is good and seems to follow the general idea of the graphic novels (though take that with a grain of salt as I've read a few of them but don't have the whole collection on my shelf). Women who want a pretty boy beefcake get a few shots of the actor scantily clad and Thor fans will get a lot of overview of the Asgardian world (as well as Jotunheim) and a ton of Mjolnir action. The Frost Giants are done well and the play on ice was particularly better than I thought. Thor is headstrong and dumb early on but hopefully gains some wisdom (though I doubt he'll ditch his famous temper). Some people may have been expecting more of a battle epic ending but the focus was more on Thor's character maturing enough to become a great king like his father so the incident with the Bifrost Bridge shouldn't be entirely surprising (even if disappointing to some). Purists might have issue that not all of the Asgardians are white but who's to say those gods can't represent mortals all over the world? After all, who says the old Norse people got it right on skin colors anyway? That said, it's a nice inclusion of non white viewers into the world and this is the 21st century so it's probably a good move just as it's a good idea to have female style action heroes to make females feel more included in the fun. The romance with Portman was ho hum but acceptable. Loki was predictable but better than expected and Anthony Hopkins was a notch below par. I'm glad the franchise will continue as Thor is one of the more interesting Marvel Heroes. SPECIAL EFFECTS/ACTION: B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B to B plus; STORY/PLOTTING: B; OVERALL GRADE: B to B plus; WHEN WATCHED: today.; BEST DIALOGUE: Volstagg: Can't you keep the bridge open for us? Heimdall: Keeping the bridge open would unleash the full power of the Bifrost and destroy Jotunheim, with you on it. Thor: I have no plans to die today. Heimdall: None do. //// Agent Phil Coulson: [interrogative] It's not easy to do what you did. You made my men - some of the most highly trained professionals in the world - look like a bunch of minimum-wage mall cops. In my experience, it takes someone who's received similar training to do what you did to them. Why don't you tell me where you received that training? Afghanistan, Chechnya? No, you strike me more as the soldier of fortune type. Who are you? ///  // Jane Foster: Who are you? Thor: You'll know soon enough.//// Clint Barton: Do you want me to take him down or would you rather send in more guys for him to beat up? /// Jane Foster: So is this how you normally look? Thor: More or less. Jane Foster: It's a good look! LITTLE TRIVIA TIDBITS: This film opened first in Australia and then North America later and Kenneth Branagh, who brought us a lot of Shakespearean films back in the day was the director because he's a huge fan of THOR. The actor who played Thor, Chris Hemsworth, was dropped and then brought back and the dude claims he never did any weight lifting until training for this part. Yes, that was Stan Lee and writer J.

1324978,AKJ9MEE93DG5O,B0034G4P80,mitchell5954,"[1, 1]","Thor is the fourth superhero film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.  To be honest, Thor is probably my favorite movie of the MCU so far, including the Avengers.  I even like this film more than Iron Man which was also a great film.  People are somewhat mixed on the film.  Some love it, while others do not care for it.  I personally really enjoyed this film.  I thought Chris Hemsworth was the perfect choice to play for like Robert Downey Jr. was the perfect choice for Iron Man.  Anthony Hopkins is brilliant like always.  Natalie Portman also gives a great performance.  The villain is a very cunning and very relatable villain.  The effects are amazing and the action scenes are awesome.The story is quite simple.  Long ago Asghard, led by Odin (Anthony Hopkins) fought an enemy known as the Frost Giants.  Asghard won the war.  Years later Frost Giants invade Asghard but are thwarted by Odin.  Our hero Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and his friends including his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) invade the Frost Giant homeland and pretty much start another war.  For his actions Odin banishes Thor to Earth in order to become a more mature person.  There he meets a girl named Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and her family and because of them gradually grows as a person.  Then the main villain Loki sends forces to Earth to kill Thor he needs to regain his powers and defeat him.The story is basically a coming of age story.  The story is generic, but sometimes generic works.  I for one got invested into the Thor character and enjoyed following him on his journey.  The character of Thor is very arrogant and quick to anger in the beginning but not to the point where you do not like him.  As the film goes on he becomes more mature and humble and you really believe it.Natalie Portman does a great job here as well.  Natalie Portman, in the last five years has truly proven herself as a great actress.  She was given a bad name for the longest thanks to the Star Wars prequels.  She was pretty bad in those movies, but that was more George Lucas's direction than anything.  People say that the stuff on Earth was fairly boring, but it was necessary.  The stuff on Earth is there to make Thor grow as a character.  Natalie's character was definitely necessary in that.  I do agree, however, that the scenes on Earth could have been a bit shorter.The villain Loki is also great.  Of all the villains in these Marvel movies in this universe, I think that Loki is the best one, at least in this movie.  He is made into more of a generic bad guy in the Avengers, but here you really buy his motivations.  You find out that he is actually the son of Asghard's enemy.  Plus, Odin always held Thor in higher regard than him and he wanted to prove himself.  You do not condone what he does but you see where he is coming from.The effects of this film are Breathtaking.  Though I like the Earth stuff for the most part I just love when they are in Asghard or in the Frost Giant realm.  The CGI is simple beautiful.  The action scenes are also great particularly the one where Thor and his friends fight the Frost Giants in their realm in the beginning of the film.  I did not see the film in 3D so I cannot comment on that.Overall, Thor is a great coming of age story.  Before this movie came out I would have never thought that Thor could work in live action.  However, this film and the Avengers definitely proved me wrong.  If you are a fan of the Thor comics or are just a fan of the MCU them definitely check this out.  Hopefully Thor 2 will be just as awesome if not more so.",5,My Favorite Film in the MCU So Far!,1379894400,"09 23, 2013",2013,3572,"['Thor', 'fourth', 'superhero', 'film', 'Marvel', 'Cinematic', 'Universe', 'be', 'honest', 'Thor', 'probably', 'favorite', 'movie', 'MCU', 'so', 'far', 'including', 'Avengers', 'even', 'film', 'more', 'Iron', 'Man', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'film', 'People', 'are', 'somewhat', 'mixed', 'film', 'love', 'others', 'do', 'not', 'care', 'personally', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'thought', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'was', 'perfect', 'choice', 'play', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'was', 'perfect', 'choice', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'brilliant', 'always', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'also', 'great', 'performance', 'villain', 'very', 'cunning', 'very', 'relatable', 'villain', 'effects', 'are', 'amazing', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'awesome.The', 'story', 'quite', 'simple', 'Long', 'ago', 'Asghard', 'led', 'Odin', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'fought', 'enemy', 'known', 'Frost', 'Giants', 'Asghard', 'won', 'war', 'Years', 'later', 'Frost', 'Giants', 'invade', 'Asghard', 'are', 'thwarted', 'Odin', 'hero', 'Thor', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'friends', 'including', 'brother', 'Loki', 'Tom', 'Hiddleston', 'invade', 'Frost', 'Giant', 'homeland', 'pretty', 'much', 'start', 'war', 'actions', 'Odin', 'banishes', 'Thor', 'Earth', 'order', 'become', 'more', 'mature', 'person', 'girl', 'named', 'Jane', 'Foster', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'family', 'gradually', 'person', 'Then', 'main', 'villain', 'Loki', 'forces', 'Earth', 'kill', 'Thor', 'regain', 'powers', 'defeat', 'him.The', 'story', 'basically', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'story', 'generic', 'sometimes', 'generic', 'works', 'one', 'got', 'invested', 'Thor', 'character', 'enjoyed', 'following', 'journey', 'character', 'Thor', 'very', 'arrogant', 'quick', 'anger', 'beginning', 'not', 'point', 'where', 'do', 'not', 'film', 'more', 'mature', 'humble', 'really', 'believe', 'it.Natalie', 'Portman', 'great', 'job', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'last', 'five', 'years', 'truly', 'proven', 'great', 'actress', 'was', 'given', 'bad', 'name', 'longest', 'thanks', 'Star', 'Wars', 'prequels', 'was', 'pretty', 'bad', 'movies', 'was', 'more', 'George', 'Lucas', 'direction', 'anything', 'People', 'say', 'stuff', 'Earth', 'was', 'fairly', 'boring', 'was', 'necessary', 'stuff', 'Earth', 'there', 'make', 'Thor', 'grow', 'character', 'Natalie', 'character', 'was', 'definitely', 'necessary', 'do', 'agree', 'however', 'scenes', 'Earth', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'shorter.The', 'villain', 'Loki', 'also', 'great', 'villains', 'Marvel', 'movies', 'universe', 'think', 'Loki', 'best', 'one', 'least', 'movie', 'made', 'more', 'generic', 'bad', 'guy', 'Avengers', 'here', 'really', 'buy', 'motivations', 'find', 'out', 'actually', 'son', 'Asghard', 'enemy', 'Odin', 'always', 'held', 'Thor', 'higher', 'regard', 'wanted', 'prove', 'do', 'not', 'condone', 'what', 'see', 'where', 'coming', 'from.The', 'effects', 'film', 'are', 'Breathtaking', 'like', 'Earth', 'stuff', 'most', 'part', 'just', 'love', 'when', 'are', 'Asghard', 'Frost', 'Giant', 'realm', 'CGI', 'simple', 'beautiful', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'particularly', 'one', 'where', 'Thor', 'friends', 'fight', 'Frost', 'Giants', 'realm', 'beginning', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'film', '3D', 'can', 'not', 'comment', 'that.Overall', 'Thor', 'great', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'thought', 'Thor', 'could', 'work', 'live', 'action', 'However', 'film', 'Avengers', 'definitely', 'proved', 'wrong', 'are', 'fan', 'Thor', 'comics', 'are', 'just', 'fan', 'MCU', 'definitely', 'check', 'out', 'Hopefully', 'Thor', '2', 'will', 'be', 'just', 'awesome', 'not', 'more', 'so']",N/A

I really enjoyed everyone's performances, though Tom Hiddleston's Loki is by far the most engaging character.Some of the cinematography was far too clever by half, with dizzying CGI landscapes that, while beautiful, were too dark or too abstract to really appreciate.  But when Brannagh pointed the camera at real landscapes and real people instead of CGI constructs, it was wonderful.Fun, exciting, beautiful colors (Thor's cape, the gold of Heimdall's armor, Loki's turquoise eyes - everything pops), and really good performances from all the leads and the supporting cast.

The story was okay, though somewhat laughable at times (I knew the source material would be hard to convert to a film without sounding cheesy), the acting was good and the CGI was adequate. Maybe it was the 3-D, but some of the visuals looked blurry or flat out cheaply done. I almost didn't see it in 3-D because it was done after the fact, but most critics had said that it was used properly for a change.There are a couple of mentions that link this character with the other heroes for the upcoming Avengers movie, which was sort of neat in Iron Man and Iron Man 2, but now it seems like just a ploy to hype up that future film.

I'm not saying it was ""good"", just better than Captain America.  SPOILERS.Thor is basically your classic Cain and Abel story.  Odin has two sons... one good and one bad.  Thor and Loki.  One tries to kill the other... you know, the usual stuff.  Does it matter that this is inconsistent with Norse mythology - guess not...Stick with me here - I expected less from Thor in terms of plot because the entire concept was wrapped up in Norse myth and legend.  On the other hand, Captain America was a story about soldiers in WWII.  Given the context of each story, I'll give Thor a little more wiggle room in terms of plot details making sense or not.  The whole story is more ""fantasy"" in the first place.The only part I found myself really questioning was when Loki travels to Earth to visit Thor while he is being held captive.  How does he do that?  Where does he come from?  Is he Puff the Magic Dragon or something?  Why doesn't anyone see them talking or hear them talking?  How does Loki get back afterward?  One minute ""Poof"" he is there... the next ""Poof"" he is gone.  Did he use the magic stargate thing?  Obviously not because everyone would notice the giant tornado of clouds and light coming down out of the sky.  Soooooo?????You know what this sequence reminded me of (of course your do)?  It reminded me of the part in The Matrix when Cifer meets with the agents and plots his betrayal.  Wait - how did Cifer get into the matrix to do that?  Someone has to jack him in.  Someone has to monitor him while he is in the matrix.  Soooo... how does Cifer get in and talk to the agents?  It makes no sense.  He can't.Same thing here.  Unless Loki got beamed down from the Enterprise, there is no way he could have just appeared and then disappeared.  There is also no way he could have run around the complex without being noticed -  unless he can stop time or something... which he can't... and even if he could he obviously didn't.Sorry - this stuff just really irritates me.  Hollywood spends million of dollars to make these movies and no one asks these questions?  Are you telling me that none of the producers or actors stopped for a minute and said ""Hey wait a minute... how does Loki just appear like that?  That doesn't make sense...""  Doesn't that happen?  Isn't there someone checking this stuff for consistency?  On the other hand, perhaps the directors, producers, actors, etc just don't care.I sort of thought the same thing regarding the fact that Loki was really a frost giant baby that was adopted by Odin.  Apparently, Odin can touch frost giant offspring and make them look human?  What?  Is this some sort of Midas touch that turns monsters into Norwegians or something?  So Loki is a frost giant, but doesn't know he is a frost giant, but when he figures out he is a frost giant he suddenly learns to use frost giant powers?

One of Marvel's more difficult challenges to bring to the live action film turns out to be their best effort since the first Iron Man film. I know purist will have a hard time with Dr. Donald Blake not being anymore than a name and nothing to do with the God of Thunder here, but with the way this film ended, I can see an interesting way to introduce him as he should be.*****SPOILER ALERT*****Now that the bridge from Asgard to Earth has been destroyed, maybe the only way for Thor to return to earth is to project his being into a earthling who is worthy?  and that someone will need a a certain item to conjure up the Norse God.(a staff maybe?) It would be nice if they could introduce Blake as Thor's alter ego to add some dimension to the role and give ""old goldilocks"" a breather.******END OF SPOILER******Now on to the film, it works! Mainly because the three H's (main actors) are exceptional in their roles. Hemsworth, Hiddleston and Hopkins are completely committed to their roles and they pull off what could have been a disaster. Portman is also very good, but I didn't feel she was irreplaceable, though quite nice to look at, she isn't given as much to do as she could have been if Thor's alter ego was involved.The action is great, but a little too sparse for my taste, with Thor's Mjolnir his impressive weapon of choice. I'm glad that they did use some of his signature uses such as the helicopter spinning hammer and various others.Hemsworth seems born for the role and I can't wait to see The Avengers movie..... as for Captain America? well, I am having a hard time with Chris Evans in the title role after he completely owned his role as the Human Torch. I'm mean really? wasn't there another blonde-ish guy with a great physique they could find to play Captain America? He seems a little boy-ish to be playing Cap.

Directed by Kenneth Branagh and starring Chris Hemsworth as the title character, Thor is a fairly brisk and wonderfully fun film that doesn't quite feel a major set-up for The Avengers movie like Iron Man 2 did before it.  Exiled to Earth by his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) to learn humility, Thor becomes attracted to Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and seeks to return home to Asgard, while his nefarious brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) plots a hostile takeover of his homeworld.  With a wonderful cast that also features Kat Dennings, Stellan Skarsgard, Colm Feore, Rene Russo, and Idris Elba, Ray Stevenson, and Jamie Alexander as fellow Gods and friends, Thor is a flat-out blast.  Even though it doesn't leave that same feeling of awe-inspiring awesomeness that the first Iron Man did, Thor is a great adaptation of a legendary comic book character, and here's hoping that the next time we see the Thunder God on the big screen, it will be just as good or hopefully even better.",4,You don't mess with the God of Thunder,1312416000,"08 4, 2011",2011,1228,"['Growing', 'up', 'never', 'thought', 'wildest', 'dreams', ""'d"", 'ever', 'see', 'big-budget', 'take', 'Thor', 'classic', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'character', 'really', 'never', 'had', 'massive', 'following', 'universal', 'appeal', 'say', 'Spider-Man', 'X-Men', 'had', 'yet', 'here', 'are', 'Directed', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'starring', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'title', 'character', 'Thor', 'fairly', 'brisk', 'wonderfully', 'fun', 'film', ""n't"", 'quite', 'feel', 'major', 'set-up', 'Avengers', 'movie', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'did', 'Exiled', 'Earth', 'father', 'Odin', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'learn', 'humility', 'Thor', 'becomes', 'attracted', 'Jane', 'Foster', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'return', 'home', 'Asgard', 'nefarious', 'brother', 'Loki', 'Tom', 'Hiddleston', 'plots', 'hostile', 'takeover', 'homeworld', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'also', 'Kat', 'Dennings', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgard', 'Colm', 'Feore', 'Rene', 'Russo', 'Idris', 'Elba', 'Ray', 'Stevenson', 'Jamie', 'Alexander', 'fellow', 'Gods', 'friends', 'Thor', 'flat-out', 'blast', 'Even', ""n't"", 'leave', 'same', 'feeling', 'awe-inspiring', 'awesomeness', 'first', 'Iron', 'Man', 'did', 'Thor', 'great', 'adaptation', 'legendary', 'comic', 'book', 'character', 'here', 'hoping', 'next', 'time', 'see', 'Thunder', 'God', 'big', 'screen', 'will', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'hopefully', 'even', 'better']",N/A

1325019,A12FLZREV32JOP,B0034G4P80,Noelle Eiram,"[2, 7]","One can't say Kenneth Branagh's Thor isn't ambitious. This adaptation of a comic book based on Norse mythology includes romance, humor, family drama, and lots of special effects. Unfortunately, the film is a confusing mish mash, aspiring to be both more and less than what it is.The film begins in a New Mexican desert and awkwardly segues into a distant flashback, before moving into a more recent flashback and then back to the present. The recent flashback follows the warrior Thor (Chris Hemsworth), son of Odin (Anthony Hopkins), king of the planet Asgard. Thor's arrogance lands him on Earth many miles from home. Confused and frustrated, he stumbles upon a group of scientists, at least one of whom, Jane (Natalie Portman), is willing to overlook his bizarre behavior and help him find a way home.One section of this film is set in Asgard, a visual creation both kitschy and beautiful. A much lighter section involves Thor's humorous adjustment to Earth. Yet another section involves S.H.I.E.L.D., a group of government agents who are interested in an unmovable hammer which Odin threw to earth.The script is an odd mixture of genuinely funny and unintentionally humorous. The social and physical laws that govern Asgard are hardly explained, and the pacing picks up when our hero falls to Earth. The agents are present to connect Thor to other superhero films produced by Marvel, and S.H.I.E.L.D.'s role is entirely unrelated to the plot. However, its scenes are some of the most functional in the movie.The actors seem to be in several different films. Hemsworth fares well as Thor, seamlessly shifting between several genres. His transformation from cocky to contrite to compassionate is far more believable than his love story. Portman's Jane is cute and her attraction to Thor is understandable, but the film implies that they fall in love without showing us how. Watching them giggle at one another is not particularly gripping.Kat Dennings, who plays Jane's assistant Darcy, is natural in her delivery of amusing one-liners. Thor's friends, The Warriors Three, seem to have stepped out of a science fiction show, Hopkins is low key as the patriarch, and Renee Russo has a thankless, tiny role as Thor's helpless mother. Colm Feore does his best as Laufey, leader of the blue Frost Giants, and a great Idris Elba plays a seemingly implacable gatekeeper to other worlds.Most baffling (and, in some ways, interesting) is Thor's brother Loki, played by Tom Hiddleston. He appears to be in five different movies. Loki is almost as important a character as Thor. Too little time is spent with him to completely understand his motivations, but because the audience follows his character, the tricks he pulls feel like tricks on the audience. Alternately calculated and extremely emotional, he is more bizarre than intriguingly ambiguous. Hiddleston gives an expressive, even furious performance, making his campier moments stand out all the more.Patrick Doyle's soundtrack is stirring. Sometimes its high quality only emphasizes what the film lacks. In the end, Thor's numerous distractions prevent it from either remaining lighthearted or developing its mythological elements. Weighed down by special effects, action, and dumb lines, Thor is an original idea that seems determined to be a mediocre film.",3,Had Potential,1312070400,"07 31, 2011",2011,3311,"['One', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'Thor', ""n't"", 'ambitious', 'adaptation', 'comic', 'book', 'based', 'Norse', 'mythology', 'romance', 'humor', 'family', 'drama', 'lots', 'special', 'effects', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'confusing', 'mish', 'mash', 'aspiring', 'be', 'more', 'less', 'what', 'film', 'begins', 'New', 'Mexican', 'desert', 'awkwardly', 'segues', 'distant', 'flashback', 'moving', 'more', 'recent', 'flashback', 'then', 'back', 'present', 'recent', 'flashback', 'warrior', 'Thor', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'son', 'Odin', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'king', 'planet', 'Asgard', 'Thor', 'arrogance', 'Earth', 'many', 'miles', 'home', 'Confused', 'frustrated', 'group', 'scientists', 'least', 'one', 'whom', 'Jane', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'willing', 'overlook', 'bizarre', 'behavior', 'help', 'find', 'way', 'home.One', 'section', 'film', 'set', 'Asgard', 'visual', 'creation', 'kitschy', 'beautiful', 'much', 'lighter', 'section', 'Thor', 'humorous', 'adjustment', 'Earth', 'section', 'S.H.I.E.L.D.', 'group', 'government', 'agents', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'unmovable', 'hammer', 'Odin', 'threw', 'earth.The', 'script', 'odd', 'mixture', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'unintentionally', 'humorous', 'social', 'physical', 'laws', 'govern', 'Asgard', 'are', 'hardly', 'explained', 'pacing', 'up', 'when', 'hero', 'Earth', 'agents', 'are', 'present', 'connect', 'Thor', 'other', 'superhero', 'films', 'produced', 'Marvel', 'S.H.I.E.L.D', 'role', 'entirely', 'unrelated', 'plot', 'However', 'scenes', 'are', 'most', 'functional', 'movie.The', 'actors', 'seem', 'be', 'several', 'different', 'films', 'Hemsworth', 'well', 'Thor', 'seamlessly', 'shifting', 'several', 'genres', 'transformation', 'cocky', 'contrite', 'compassionate', 'far', 'more', 'believable', 'love', 'story', 'Portman', 'Jane', 'cute', 'attraction', 'Thor', 'understandable', 'film', 'implies', 'fall', 'love', 'showing', 'how', 'Watching', 'giggle', 'one', 'not', 'particularly', 'gripping.Kat', 'Dennings', 'who', 'Jane', 'assistant', 'Darcy', 'natural', 'delivery', 'amusing', 'one-liners', 'Thor', 'friends', 'Warriors', 'Three', 'seem', 'have', 'stepped', 'science', 'fiction', 'show', 'Hopkins', 'low', 'key', 'patriarch', 'Renee', 'Russo', 'thankless', 'tiny', 'role', 'Thor', 'helpless', 'mother', 'Colm', 'Feore', 'best', 'Laufey', 'leader', 'blue', 'Frost', 'Giants', 'great', 'Idris', 'Elba', 'seemingly', 'implacable', 'gatekeeper', 'other', 'worlds.Most', 'baffling', 'ways', 'interesting', 'Thor', 'brother', 'Loki', 'played', 'Tom', 'Hiddleston', 'be', 'five', 'different', 'movies', 'Loki', 'almost', 'important', 'character', 'Thor', 'Too', 'little', 'time', 'spent', 'completely', 'understand', 'motivations', 'audience', 'character', 'tricks', 'feel', 'tricks', 'audience', 'Alternately', 'calculated', 'extremely', 'emotional', 'more', 'bizarre', 'intriguingly', 'ambiguous', 'Hiddleston', 'expressive', 'even', 'furious', 'performance', 'making', 'campier', 'moments', 'stand', 'out', 'more.Patrick', 'Doyle', 'soundtrack', 'stirring', 'high', 'quality', 'only', 'what', 'film', 'lacks', 'end', 'Thor', 'numerous', 'distractions', 'prevent', 'remaining', 'lighthearted', 'developing', 'mythological', 'elements', 'Weighed', 'down', 'special', 'effects', 'action', 'dumb', 'lines', 'Thor', 'original', 'idea', 'determined', 'be', 'mediocre', 'film']",N/A

The beginning's a bit awkward--starting with Thor's arrival on Earth, then abruptly backtracking to how he got there and replaying the opening scene, but from there on, the pacing is excellent.A prince in his own realm, heir to the throne of Asgard, Thor is a young man in desperate need of some anger management counseling. This prince's temper is measured on the Richter scale. When his coronation is interrupted by the intrusion of  beings from another realm, Thor seeks revenge--and re-ignites an ancient war. This leads his angry and disappointed father, Odin, to banish him to Midgard--Earth--to teach him a lesson in humility. Thor must live as a mortal man until he can prove himself worthy. Then, and only then, will his magic hammer, Mjolnir, be returned to him, along with his power and his immortality.Mjolnir has also been sent to Earth--trapped in a Sword in the Stone-type scenario in the New Mexico desert. (Look for Thor's creator, Stan Lee, in his obligatory cameo as one of a crowd of rednecks trying to withdraw the mystical hammer from the stone. Good thing Stan can afford to buy a new truck!)The fish-out-of-water aspect of the story is humorous without being over the top. In Thor's first twenty-four hours on Earth, he's hit by a car twice (three times if you count the replay of the opening scene), had a hypodermic full of tranquilizers shot into his butt, gone drinking with Jane Foster's mentor, Erik Selvig (and had to carry him home when he passed out), and takes on a platoon of S.H.I.E.L.D. guards surrounding Mjolnir.It was those moments of humor I enjoyed most--and that price-of-admission scene of a shirtless Thor (when the film comes out on DVD, that scene's going to get a lot of replay action). Chris Hemsworth portrays Thor with the regal bearing of a prince, the ferocity of a warrior, and the good humor of a regular guy.  The budding romance between Thor and Jane (Natalie Portman), however, didn't get enough screen time to convince the audience it was true love. Note to screenwriters: SHOW, DON'T TELL! The audience needs to believe Thor has made enough of an emotional bond with Jane and others here on Earth to overcome centuries of arrogance  on his part.As Thor comes to terms with his exile, trouble is brewing in Asgard. Odin has fallen into a coma and Thor's younger brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston), is taking over the kingdom. Thor's loyal friends, the Lady Sif and the Warriors Three, defy royal decree and head for Earth to find him and bring him home. In a confrontation with a gigantic destroyer from their realm, the five of them join forces to defeat the enemy. And when Thor makes the decision to sacrifice himself, caring more for Jane and the others than for himself, his powers and his immortality are restored.The dialogue is sharp and witty. In one scene, future Avenger Hawkeye observes Thor's battles with S.H.I.E.L.D. security and asks Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) if he should take him out ""or are you going to send out more guys for him to beat up?""When Thor's Asgardian buddies walk down the town's main street in search of their friend, a S.H.I.E.L.D. operative reports to Coulson, ""We have Xena, Robin Hood....""And then there's the scene in which Thor goes to a pet shop to get a horse. When he's told they only sell dogs, cats and birds, he says, ""Give me one big enough to ride.""There are also not-so-subtle nods to other Marvel superheroes. When the Asgardian destroyer arrives on Earth, Agent Coulson is asked, ""Is that one of Stark's?"" To which Coulson responds, ""That man never tells me anything.""

Thor is pure derivative Hollywood by-the-book script writing.  The acting is television calibre for the most part and the music utterly forgettable.  The best aspects of this flick are the f/x on the planet Asgard.  They are evocative and beautiful.  The earth action is forgettable, and hobbled by a very lame romantic interest in the non-charismatic person of Natalie Portman as Jane.  Her Tarzan (you Jane) is played well by Chris Hemsworth who looks more like and advertisement for Golds Gym than a lead in a major Hollywood production.  But he does well with little.  His brother, Loki, is much more interesting, played by Tom Hiddleston.  But villains always steal the show with a script this weak and sophomoric.The ubiquitous and versatile Anthony Hopkins is a fine Odin but he spends most of this movie in a coma watched over by Frigga his wife played by the lovely Ren&eacute;e Russo who is utterly wasted in this part.  The other lesser gods are anonymous action hero figures from Diablo II.Everything about this movie is derivative.  Parts of it reminded me of the great computer game Diablo: Lord of Destruction, mixed up with other computer game imagery.  The earth characters are only half-drawn persons and of no interest at all.  The script lacks humor which is fatal in a comic book story like this.

1325053,A1W45HIJSPH62I,B0034G4P80,Philip J. Herman,"[24, 31]","I am 58 and was a huge fan of the Jack Kirby Thor comics. Kirby captured the feeling of Asgaard perfectly for me. As with all of the Marvel superhero movies, we realize that most of the bulk of the comics was filled with fighting. That's why I liked Kirby... he made the fight scenes artistic, so I didn't actually realize they were violent. They were visual ballets, artistically designed sparring matches. This never really happens in the films... so far.I could criticize this film by imagining how it could have been better... i.e. The Asgaardian scenes could have been more Michelangelo-ish, incredibly posed figures, dramatic and dynamic compositions, lyrical sunlit interludes, trolls and monsters and sparring matches, blah, blah, blah. But I realize that the director is only human, he is dealing with actors, and there is a budget... and... the film has to look like a Marvel film. That said... this is a pretty good film. I found myself caring for Thor when he is mortal, wishing he would kiss the girl, thrilled when he got his hammer/power back.I will note another movie-making problem here. Remember when they made Spiderman? and the CGI people had to make Doc Oc's arms realistically walk? I read that they had trouble because Steve Ditko had drawn great artwork that worked 2 dimensionally as still shots, but that the in-between action was very hard to visualize. Something like that is going on in the Thor movie. Kirby drew great sets, but we never actually saw the Gods transport anywhere, there was not an actual explanation of how they went anywhere and where that anywhere was. So in the movie we get this kind of science fiction universe, with a giant matter transporter and a rainbow bridge/wormhole. I suppose it sort-of works, and it had to be done somehow... but it all felt kind of forced.Now on to my dislikes. I never liked the frost giants in the comics. Kirby could never figure out how to draw them adequately, so I never liked them. In the movie, they are dark and black&blue;, and their world is dark and black&blue.; They look like bad guys, or like those Borg in Star Trek. They almost spoiled the movie for me. And then on top of that, they are main characters! They have their own realm where they just stand around stiffly being cold!And the OdinSleep! It is not explained at all. And it seems forced and unnecessary... it's a plot device.And Thor's friends from the comic book are there. But they are not as interesting and they don't do much. Volstagg is not as fat and not as funny. Sif is not as elegant and cool. Fandral is not as dashing. The other guy is now oriental, I don't remember that from the comic, but it's been a long time.Asgaard should have been more over-the-top hugely dramatic. With more eloquent speeches.Loki has been transformed from a God of mischief into a troubled son of dubious parents who is misguided and then really bad and then violent and then devious. He is confusing. He should have been much more melodramatic. He should have been a scene-stealer. The real star of the film.Thor is ok. Just ok. He looks pretty good. They altered Kirby's original outfit a little... it's darker ( what isn't anymore) He should have been more childish, fun-loving, braggadoshilicious, God-like.Most of my comments are based on my fond memories of Jack Kirby's Tales of Asgaard, Tales to Astonish, The Mighty Thor. That was a long time ago and I'm sure the Thor comic changed a lot over the years since then. I remember a long series of stories involving Hercules and spaceships and aliens and lots and lots of fun, fun, fun and imagination.There are a lot of funny, tongue-in-cheek moments in this movie. And I appreciated them. Stan Lee driving the pickup that tries to pull Thor's hammer out of the crater, The guy from  SHIELD, when confronted with the Destroyer, says to no one "" it's probably one of Tony Stark's, he never tells me anything"" These kind of moments harken back to the good ole days of Marvel.Oh, the Destroyer. One of my favorite Kirby designs,,, the empty suit of armor with a death beam. Seems kind of silly nowadays. In the movie it is taller and skinnier, but still scary.Again, the worst part of the film is the too dark Frost Giants and their realm. Anything else would have been better. Loki was too evil and confused. Odin was OK, should have been more massive. Asgaard should have been more dramatic. The scientists are pretty good. Nice ensemble group. Better than Thor's friends.Worth seeing, not great.",3,almost Kirby-esque... too much sci-fi,1316044800,"09 15, 2011",2011,4495,"['am', '58', 'was', 'huge', 'fan', 'Jack', 'Kirby', 'Thor', 'comics', 'Kirby', 'captured', 'feeling', 'Asgaard', 'perfectly', 'Marvel', 'superhero', 'movies', 'realize', 'most', 'bulk', 'comics', 'was', 'filled', 'fighting', 'why', 'liked', 'Kirby', 'made', 'fight', 'scenes', 'artistic', 'did', ""n't"", 'actually', 'realize', 'were', 'violent', 'were', 'visual', 'ballets', 'artistically', 'designed', 'sparring', 'matches', 'never', 'really', 'films', 'so', 'far.I', 'could', 'criticize', 'film', 'imagining', 'how', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'i.e', 'Asgaardian', 'scenes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'Michelangelo-ish', 'incredibly', 'posed', 'figures', 'dramatic', 'dynamic', 'compositions', 'lyrical', 'sunlit', 'interludes', 'trolls', 'monsters', 'sparring', 'matches', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'realize', 'director', 'only', 'human', 'dealing', 'actors', 'budget', 'film', 'look', 'Marvel', 'film', 'said', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'found', 'caring', 'Thor', 'when', 'mortal', 'wishing', 'would', 'kiss', 'girl', 'thrilled', 'when', 'got', 'hammer/power', 'back.I', 'will', 'note', 'movie-making', 'problem', 'here', 'Remember', 'when', 'made', 'Spiderman', 'CGI', 'people', 'had', 'make', 'Doc', 'Oc', 'arms', 'realistically', 'walk', 'read', 'had', 'trouble', 'Steve', 'Ditko', 'had', 'drawn', 'great', 'artwork', 'worked', '2', 'dimensionally', 'still', 'shots', 'in-between', 'action', 'was', 'very', 'hard', 'visualize', 'Something', 'going', 'Thor', 'movie', 'Kirby', 'drew', 'great', 'sets', 'never', 'actually', 'saw', 'Gods', 'transport', 'anywhere', 'was', 'not', 'actual', 'explanation', 'how', 'went', 'anywhere', 'where', 'anywhere', 'was', 'So', 'movie', 'get', 'kind', 'science', 'fiction', 'universe', 'giant', 'matter', 'transporter', 'rainbow', 'bridge/wormhole', 'suppose', 'sort-of', 'works', 'had', 'be', 'done', 'somehow', 'felt', 'kind', 'forced.Now', 'dislikes', 'never', 'liked', 'frost', 'giants', 'comics', 'Kirby', 'could', 'never', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'draw', 'adequately', 'never', 'liked', 'movie', 'are', 'dark', 'black', 'blue', 'world', 'dark', 'black', 'blue', 'look', 'bad', 'guys', 'Borg', 'Star', 'Trek', 'almost', 'spoiled', 'movie', 'then', 'top', 'are', 'main', 'characters', 'have', 'own', 'realm', 'where', 'just', 'stand', 'around', 'stiffly', 'being', 'cold', 'OdinSleep', 'not', 'explained', 'forced', 'unnecessary', 'plot', 'device.And', 'Thor', 'friends', 'comic', 'book', 'are', 'there', 'are', 'not', 'interesting', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'Volstagg', 'not', 'fat', 'not', 'funny', 'Sif', 'not', 'elegant', 'cool', 'Fandral', 'not', 'dashing', 'other', 'guy', 'now', 'oriental', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'comic', 'been', 'long', 'time.Asgaard', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'over-the-top', 'hugely', 'dramatic', 'more', 'eloquent', 'speeches.Loki', 'been', 'transformed', 'God', 'mischief', 'troubled', 'son', 'dubious', 'parents', 'who', 'misguided', 'then', 'really', 'bad', 'then', 'violent', 'then', 'devious', 'confusing', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'melodramatic', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'scene-stealer', 'real', 'star', 'film.Thor', 'ok.', 'Just', 'ok', 'pretty', 'good', 'altered', 'Kirby', 'original', 'outfit', 'little', 'darker', 'what', ""n't"", 'anymore', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'childish', 'fun-loving', 'braggadoshilicious', 'God-like.Most', 'comments', 'are', 'based', 'fond', 'memories', 'Jack', 'Kirby', 'Tales', 'Asgaard', 'Tales', 'Astonish', 'Mighty', 'Thor', 'was', 'long', 'time', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Thor', 'comic', 'changed', 'lot', 'years', 'then', 'remember', 'long', 'series', 'stories', 'involving', 'Hercules', 'spaceships', 'aliens', 'lots', 'lots', 'fun', 'fun', 'fun', 'are', 'lot', 'funny', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'moments', 'movie', 'appreciated', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'driving', 'pickup', 'pull', 'Thor', 'hammer', 'crater', 'guy', 'SHIELD', 'when', 'confronted', 'Destroyer', 'one', 'probably', 'one', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'never', 'anything', 'kind', 'moments', 'harken', 'back', 'good', 'ole', 'days', 'Marvel.Oh', 'Destroyer', 'One', 'favorite', 'Kirby', 'designs', 'empty', 'suit', 'armor', 'death', 'beam', 'Seems', 'kind', 'silly', 'nowadays', 'movie', 'taller', 'skinnier', 'still', 'scary.Again', 'worst', 'part', 'film', 'too', 'dark', 'Frost', 'Giants', 'realm', 'Anything', 'else', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Loki', 'was', 'too', 'evil', 'confused', 'Odin', 'was', 'OK', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'massive', 'Asgaard', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'dramatic', 'scientists', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'Nice', 'ensemble', 'group', 'Better', 'Thor', 'friends.Worth', 'seeing', 'not', 'great']",N/A

Loki is done beautifully by Hiddleston, Hemsworth is a truly worthy Thor and good old, reliable Anthony Hopkins RULES the screen whenever he is en scene as Odin, king of the Norse pantheon. His handling of Thor when he is castigated for his arrogance, (which Hemsworth brings off well,) is a study on how to handle a headstrong, powerful son....STRONGLY!!

1325059,AB6BQXTOMO7F7,B0034G4P80,PJS1975,"[8, 12]","Warning: May contain spoilersDirector Kenneth Branagh's ""Thor"" has a 2011 look, slick production values, and at the same time feels like one of those never-to-be-taken-seriously 80s action fantasy flicks, along the lines of ""Masters of the Universe"" or ""Superman II"".And like those 80s not-so-greaties, ""Thor's"" storyline is an uninspired snore: In eternal Asgard, Thor acts rashly. Odin disapproves and banishes Thor from Asgard, taking from him his power (Thor's hammer). Thor arrives on Earth. Thor's brother Loki schemes. Odin disapproves of Loki's actions, has a stroke or something, and banishes himSELF into a ""Norse god coma."" Thor befriends a family of earthlings. Loki schemes some more. Thor can't recover his hammer. Thor rescues the earthlings from deadly peril. Odin approves of Thor's act. Thor can finally recover his hammer. Thor fights Loki. The end. Oh, and there are also some frost giants.No, I never read the Marvel comic, but ""Thor's"" superheroic feats are definitely of the ""boys in their early teens"" variety. The movie is kind of humourous in a goofy way, and not terribly acted, which helps. In fact, the two lead performers, Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman, are fairly well realized, not dumbed-down characters who show good chemistry; all their scenes together look and feel right. Hemsworth plays Thor totally straight, as haughty and deific as some transcosmic sci-fi overlord might come across, with each of his Jarlsberg-sculpted lines of dialogue wearing its own Asgard style flowing opera cape; and, mercifully, not one stale pop-culture catchphrase comes from between his chiseled jaws. Portman performs her ""amused, weirded-out tolerance mixed with mature, scientific wonder"" with the right balance of gravity and a bit of humour. Perfect score there.It is in its generic take on a lot of the characters who occupy the story's margins where ""Thor"" loses most of its points, in my opinion. Anthony Hopkins, in the role of Odin, is an outstanding actor, but the character himself is flat. Odin either A.) approves or B.) disapproves of his sons' deeds, and apart from that, he has little to do: another ""stern father"" caricature without nuances or distinguishing personality traits.That Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is jealous of Thor is established from practically the first scene in which both characters appear. Showing more of an inner battle between Loki's jealous, scheming self and his loyal-to-Asgard self might have created some genuine suspense and drama, but, once again, there's nothing here to surprise the movie-viewer.The King of the Jotuns (frost giants), played to the hilt by Colm Feore, is appropriately menacing and demoniac, but he comes across as merely Loki's chesspiece, as lacking in self-determinism as a powerful gun, or, say, Thor's hammer. Having an agenda of his own might've generated more suspense among the Thor-Loki-Frost giant triangle of cross-purposes; but again, no surprises here.And Heimdall (Idris Elba), who ostensibly guards the bridge Bifrost, a bridge between Asgard and other worlds, never appears to actually guard the bridge. Why is the Heimdall character even there, if not to pose some challenge or obstacle, or, in the alternative, to fit key-in-lock into the movie's denouement? He just sort of... is what he is.The verdict: Is Thor a snore? More than the lore of yore, that's for sure. But if your brain needs a night off, then I say go with it. Hoist a flagon of ale, get hammered and watch this 80s redux; and may the mirth and amusement of the gods be thine.",2,SNOR....,1317686400,"10 4, 2011",2011,3547,"['Warning', 'May', 'contain', 'spoilersDirector', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'Thor', '2011', 'look', 'slick', 'production', 'values', 'same', 'time', 'feels', 'one', 'never-to-be-taken-seriously', '80s', 'action', 'fantasy', 'flicks', 'lines', 'Masters', 'Universe', 'Superman', 'II', '.And', '80s', 'not-so-greaties', 'Thor', 'storyline', 'uninspired', 'snore', 'eternal', 'Asgard', 'Thor', 'rashly', 'Odin', 'banishes', 'Thor', 'Asgard', 'taking', 'power', 'Thor', 'hammer', 'Thor', 'Earth', 'Thor', 'brother', 'Loki', 'schemes', 'Odin', 'Loki', 'actions', 'stroke', 'something', 'himSELF', 'Norse', 'god', 'coma', 'Thor', 'family', 'earthlings', 'Loki', 'more', 'Thor', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recover', 'hammer', 'Thor', 'earthlings', 'deadly', 'peril', 'Odin', 'Thor', 'act', 'Thor', 'can', 'finally', 'recover', 'hammer', 'Thor', 'fights', 'Loki', 'end', 'Oh', 'are', 'also', 'frost', 'giants.No', 'never', 'read', 'Marvel', 'comic', 'Thor', 'superheroic', 'feats', 'are', 'definitely', 'boys', 'early', 'teens', 'variety', 'movie', 'kind', 'humourous', 'goofy', 'way', 'not', 'terribly', 'acted', 'fact', 'two', 'lead', 'performers', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'are', 'fairly', 'well', 'realized', 'not', 'dumbed-down', 'characters', 'who', 'show', 'good', 'chemistry', 'scenes', 'together', 'look', 'feel', 'right', 'Hemsworth', 'Thor', 'totally', 'straight', 'haughty', 'deific', 'transcosmic', 'sci-fi', 'overlord', 'might', 'come', 'Jarlsberg-sculpted', 'lines', 'dialogue', 'wearing', 'own', 'Asgard', 'style', 'flowing', 'opera', 'cape', 'mercifully', 'not', 'one', 'stale', 'pop-culture', 'catchphrase', 'chiseled', 'jaws', 'Portman', 'amused', 'weirded-out', 'tolerance', 'mixed', 'mature', 'scientific', 'wonder', 'right', 'balance', 'gravity', 'bit', 'humour', 'Perfect', 'score', 'there.It', 'generic', 'take', 'lot', 'characters', 'who', 'occupy', 'story', 'margins', 'where', 'Thor', 'most', 'points', 'opinion', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'role', 'Odin', 'outstanding', 'actor', 'character', 'flat', 'Odin', 'A', 'B', 'sons', 'deeds', 'apart', 'little', 'do', 'stern', 'father', 'caricature', 'nuances', 'distinguishing', 'personality', 'Loki', 'Tom', 'Hiddleston', 'jealous', 'Thor', 'established', 'practically', 'first', 'scene', 'characters', 'appear', 'Showing', 'more', 'inner', 'battle', 'Loki', 'jealous', 'scheming', 'self', 'loyal-to-Asgard', 'self', 'might', 'have', 'created', 'genuine', 'suspense', 'drama', 'once', 'again', 'nothing', 'here', 'surprise', 'movie-viewer.The', 'King', 'Jotuns', 'frost', 'giants', 'played', 'hilt', 'Colm', 'Feore', 'appropriately', 'menacing', 'demoniac', 'merely', 'Loki', 'chesspiece', 'lacking', 'self-determinism', 'powerful', 'gun', 'say', 'Thor', 'hammer', 'Having', 'agenda', 'own', 'might', ""'ve"", 'generated', 'more', 'suspense', 'Thor-Loki-Frost', 'giant', 'triangle', 'cross-purposes', 'again', 'surprises', 'here.And', 'Heimdall', 'Idris', 'Elba', 'who', 'ostensibly', 'bridge', 'Bifrost', 'bridge', 'Asgard', 'other', 'worlds', 'never', 'actually', 'guard', 'bridge', 'Why', 'Heimdall', 'character', 'even', 'there', 'not', 'pose', 'challenge', 'obstacle', 'alternative', 'fit', 'key-in-lock', 'movie', 'denouement', 'just', 'sort', 'what', 'verdict', 'Thor', 'snore', 'More', 'lore', 'yore', 'sure', 'brain', 'night', 'off', 'then', 'say', 'go', 'Hoist', 'flagon', 'ale', 'get', 'hammered', 'watch', '80s', 'redux', 'may', 'mirth', 'amusement', 'gods', 'be', 'thine']",N/A

1325076,A3UT7I4QCP1FQR,B0034G4P80,"Rajesh Motie ""Xanatos Planned This Signature""","[11, 28]","When I watch a superhero movie, I generally expect memorable heroes and villains, good action, a solid plot, and the heroes in question somehow being recognized by the public. There are other things that should be striven for, such as an interesting supporting cast, but I think a movie in the superhero subgenre can get away with leaving that out, just as long as it focuses on the first things I mentioned. But Thor doesn't have any one of them.I think Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddelston did their best with the material they were given as Thor and Loki respectively. Loki is definitely the better character, being proficient in magic and being adopted. However every time it seems like he's going to turn out to be a complex character, it just doesn't happen. Also, he's reputation as a trickster is told rather than show and he's so incredibly smarmy you'll know he's the villain from the very beginning. I don't hate Thor so much as I'm dissapointed that he doesn't become anything great. He's a hothead with a heart of gold and nothing beyond that. Hemsworth plays him likable enough and he gets a fine scene where he explains the Nine Realms to love interest Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), but I feel unsatisfied. In any case I guess he's (eventually) an okay moral center to latch onto.There's a total of about four action scenes in Thor. In the first, Thor, Loki, Sif, and the Warriors Three fight the Frost Giants in Jotunheim. The Frost Giants are boring, and it's hard to believe that their entire species would live on a world so dark and lacking in any evidence of civilization.Odin (played by Anthony Hopkins) strips his son Thor of his armor and sends him and his hammer Mjolnir hurtling to Midgard (played by Earth) so that he may learn his lesson. Thor infiltrates a small S.H.I.E.L.D. base set up around Mjolnir's landing spot to get his weapon back and punches some mooks. These first action scenes are hindered by awkward cuts and close shots. Then there's the Destroyer battle, which sees the titular metal giant stopped by a sword through its spine, a spine it wouldn't actually make sense to have. The underwhelming climax has Thor fighting Loki and stuff blowing up.Throughout all of this, Thor never truly becomes what I would call a superhero. He is never acknowledged in the public eye. Everything he does revolves around him. Saving a suspiciously film set-looking town from the Destroyer isn't enough to convince me that Thor has ""learned his lesson"". It was refreshing that he was actually willing to sacrifice himself...only for him him to start fighting the thing moments later. He's basically just dumb muscle that S.H.I.E.L.D. can call on.But what about other stuff?Like the supporting cast, for instance?When Thor lands on Earth, he is found and taken in by astrophysicist Jane Foster, her assistant Darcy (Kat Dennings) and her mentor Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard). I really liked Skarsgard's performance. He and Thor get an awesome drinking scene (just about the only genuinely funny scene in the whole movie). Kat Dennings' character seems to exist solely for failed comedic relief. Natalie Portman is completely wasted as a character that endlessly flirts with Thor in a ""you can have me ANY time!"" kind of way (this is supposed to be a believable romance). She makes no impact on Thor's character nor the story.I couldn't care less about Sif (Jamie Alexander) and the Warriors Three; Volstagg (Ray Stevenson), Fandral (Joshua Dallas) and Hogun (Tadanobu Asano). I never got a sense of camaraderie between them and Thor, and they do nothing but get smacked around during the Destroyer battle.On the artistic style: The special effects don't do much to paint a living breathing Asgard. We see no homes or citizens, and it doesn't look like the gods have much to do either. The costume design is usually pretty good, but the armor can look too plastic, and no matter how hard I tried, I simply *could not* take those capes seriously.

And this movie did a few things pretty well, while other things could have used some polish, some rewrites and maybe some different direction altogether in some areas. Helmsworth was great as Thor I'd have to admit. The story overall was rushed and I get that there is enough of Thor's back story to easily make two movies (and it is a popcorn movie) but as a comic fan you can only hope for the treatment that it deserves. The love story wasn't developed enough for anyone to care-but that aside--Portman has never looked better. Asgard was interesting but never felt 'real'. The place seemed empty and devoid of a population despite a rather large crowd shot. And the small town where Thor lands in feels a bit to much like a movie set.

Well, that's kind of the story, generally.First, the issues I had with this. The main character, Thor, wasn't all that interesting. He didn't hook me, interest me, intrigue me with who he was, what he was about and what he wanted. Main characters and villains are critical in the story. I think the villain was slightly better developed than Thor.The world he came from, was just plain hokey, the way they portrayed it. It came across ver unrealisitc (all the armor was too perfectly shiny, the capes were unnecessary). It didn't feel real to me.  Fine if you want to take me to another world. Ok. But you have to make that world ""real"" to the audience. If we don't ""buy in"" to the world, it's going to be hard to sell the story and characters.The subplot love story was really pointless. I'm not convinced it added anything to the story, or the characters. It felt more like a high school crush to me.I still don't get what the bad brother was trying to do. It didn't made sense to me. Not very well developed either (not sure if that's bad writing on the comic book series, or bad writing on the script or both).The good things, I did like some of the visuals, and some of the directing was nice. Obviously they spent some money with VFX.It would have been great if they had put equally the amount of effort in the story and character development.If you're looking for an action movie, don't care much about story, this might be the perfect movie to watch.

I tried many times to review it but I gave up each time because I was afraid words wouldn't do the film justice... and now that I've had a bit of time to digest the movie, I guess I can write a review now.I was stoked about this movie right from the get go. I am a fan of The Avengers, and have seen pretty much every movie that has led up to the upcoming Avengers movie. OK, The Incredible Hulk was tedious and forgettable, but looking past that, I enjoyed Iron man I and II, and when I heard Thor was being made, my excitement level was turned up to 11. Not to mention Captain America is coming this summer, and I am extremely stoked for that movie.Thor is more of an origin movie than anything else, really- we learn of Thor's past on Asgard, and how he was castout for disrespecting Odin's Honour, and relieved of his powers with the Hammer. We then go to earth, where a group of scientists have found him, study him, and in a way, try to protect him from a rival research group, who have set up an expedition centre surrounding the hammer. Furthermore, Odin is dying, and in this respect, Thor's brother Loki has been handed the throne, thus creating a potential conflict between Earth and Asgard.Not many people knew of Thor- Thor was a b-list hero in his day, as was Iron Man. But I feel that thanks to this movie, Thor will become the new Iron Man, and it will develop a cult following of its own someday. Kenneth Branagh takes the director's chair here, and manages to produce a very theatrical, shakespearian production. There's even tilted camera shots in this, which gives it a cool 90s Flash vibe. Chris Hemsworth is brilliant as Thor, and has adapted his humourous and quirky mannerisms well. Anthony Hopkins is brilliant as Odin as well, and Natalie Portman hams it up- in a good way of course, Portman is an incredible actress and really knows how to carry a film.If I had one complaint, it's the 3D. I would strongly advise against seeing it in 3D- it wasn't filmed in 3D to begin with, it was converted in post. There are a few pretty Asgard shots worthy of the 3D treatment but just a handful of shots isn't enough. It looked flat, and darkened the look of the film.That being said, this movie is a clear reminder of why we go to the cinema. Branagh has given us a fantastic adaptation of Thor, and has gotten me excited for Captain America and The Avengers. Oh, there's a Jeremy Renner cameo as Hawkeye, and stay through the credits for a great teaser for The Avengers!!!OVERALL: 10/10PROS:-Great acting-One of the best scripts of 2011-Awesome cinematography-Thrilling Action-Movie is appropriately paced, allowing equal amounts of action and character developmentCONS:-See it in 2D. 98% of the film's shots are unworthy of 3D.

Anthony Hopkins no surprise played his role as the regal but wise and powerful All Father Odin extremely well,  Chris Hemsworth played the young brave arrogant Thor who later learns the true wisdom of his fathers ideals perfectly, and Tom Hiddleston played the conniving jealous step brother Loki unbelievably well.  While you'll get the rest of the cast from the comic book series they seem to mostly play as background characters as the story focuses mostly on the relationship between father and sons and brothers as you get to see Loki's fall as his jealously over his brother grows especially over the relationship Thor and Odin have and the greater admiration Odin seems to have for Thor.  The movies action scenes and effects are incredible especially for us who longed to see a live action version of the realm of Asgard come to life.  While we do get Natalie Portman in the movie as a growing love interest for Thor her character just doesn't really seem needed though which I felt was a little sad as they could have done that story plot in the movie better.

For his reckless actions that reignites an ancient war, the powerful but arrogant warrior Thor (Hemsworth) is cast out of the magical realm of Asgard by his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) and exiled to live among the humans. On Earth, he meets Jane Foster, a young astrophysicist who becomes his first true love, and learns what it takes to be a true hero when his treacherous adoptive brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) seizes the throne of Asgard. Directed by Kenneth Branagh, Thor is an entertaining comic book blockbuster that delivers a fun mix of drama, humor, fantasy and action, but does fall a few notches below such notable big screen Marvel Comics releases like Spider-Man and Iron Man. Chris Hemsworth breakthrough performance as the fallen hero is one of the movie's true strengths. The cast also includes Stellan Skarsgard, Kat Dennings, Idris Alba, Ray Stevenson, Jaimie Alexander. Rene Russo and Clark Gregg.Thor certainly satisfies all the requisites of a Blu-ray release of a summer blockbuster. The superhero adventure is presented in a 2.35:1 widescreen format. Though not quite reference quality, the video transfer is certainly sharp and truly stunning. Its spectacular DTS-HD MA 7.1 soundtrack is one of the finest of any Blu-ray releases of 2011. Among special features, ""Thor"" includes an audio commentary by director Kenneth Branagh, 25 minutes of deleted scenes, theatrical trailers, several behind-the-scenes featurettes (From Asgard to Earth, Our Fearless Leader, Assembling the Troupe, Creating Laufey & Music of the Gods) and a short teaser of the animated series The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes.

1325107,AHBNPMHDWZ7SB,B0034G4P80,RJ Smoove,"[1, 1]","I think ""The God of Thunder"" would have been an awesome title for this film. It's more artistic, in my opinion. Anyway, that's not important. My sentiments on the film are as follows. First of all, Thor is very nice to look at (the movie, not the actor...or maybe they both are, but not to me). In other words, the special effects and cinematography are obviously the work of people who knew what they wanted, and how to achieve it. What they created is a unique vision, that separates itself from the pack, and decides to take a chance on some things. Perhaps the overuse of Dutch Angles will get to some people, but that didn't bother me. I was most annoyed at how frequently that one 7-Eleven showed up in the background. A little product placement doesn't bother me, but come on. Nevertheless, it's exciting to watch, and a delight to see. Asgard has to be one of the most beautiful sights that I have seen in quite a while, and it came to life brilliantly thanks to the fantastic transfer. Colors pop, and the image remains sharp throughout the lighter scenes. Obviously, more detail will be visible with more light. In fact, the only problems in the transfer can be blamed on darker scenes. I've come to expect dark scenes in films to look murky, and sometimes soft. This one is no exception. Unfortunately, there is a good amount of dark scenes, with important things to see in them at that. Thor has damn good picture quality, that's near reference, despite its shortcomings.Director Kenneth Brannaugh has brought his Shakesperian background to the Marvel Universe, and what he created is an epic story that spans three worlds, with a very strong and tragic family dynamic, as well as a few moderately underwhelming action scenes. The first set piece in Jotunheim (the Frost Giant realm) is fantastic, albeit a tad dark. I didn't mind the darkness, because it was a snowy terrain, but I wanted to see the great make-up work they did on the Giants. I also enjoyed Thor's bout with his brother, Loki, as well as Heimdall fighting the two Frost Giants for a brief second, as well as Thor infiltrating the S.H.I.E.L.D. compound. You're probably think, ""well what else is left?"" I guess the reason I felt the action was lacking overall is because the fight I was most anticipating, besides the iconic Thor vs. Loki, turned out to be the weakest in the film. That would be Thor, The Warriors Three and Lady Sif vs. The Destroyer. But anyway, the same thing that happened with both of the Iron Man films, happened here. The same could probably be said for Captain America. The ongoing trend with the films in the Avengers series is well fleshed out, and acted, characters that have many good moments to show their personalities (strengths and weaknesses), surrounded by a well-rounded cast, but lacking in the kick-ass action department (with the exception of The Incredible Hulk). Don't get me wrong, it's still never dull, and the flawless 7.1 audio is sure to rattle a window or two.The humor in this film surprised me as well. From the trailers, it seemed like Kat Dennings was going to provide a few lame attempts to squeeze a chuckle or two out of the audience. To my surprise, I laughed at pretty much all of the intended jokes. I have to admit, I even found myself enjoying the film more on Blu-ray than I did in theaters. I can't quite say why, but I did. To my surprise, the two strongest parts of the movie were the least known, and probably most questionable selections of the producers. I'm talking about the two lead actors. Chris Hemsworth, who plays Thor, and Tom Hiddleston, who plays Loki. Hemsworth has the look, obviously. He looks like he was pulled right off of the page. This may just be the role he was born to play. He was probably only known for his brief scene in Star Trek prior to this, if that. His role was pivotal, and his performance was great, but he was probably forgotten by many, due to the dynamic cast of that movie. Here he really gets his time to shine, and shine he sure does. Going in, Hiddleston was a complete unknown in my book. I usually prefer actors I recognize to play roles as big as his, but I'm surprised to say I loved him. His performance really gets to you. He's playing the main villain, but not once did I root against him.

1325126,A1BPCX5TX2HNRQ,B0034G4P80,Russ Nickel,"[5, 7]","In Thor, we are presented with an otherworldly hero of extreme power who hails from the planet Asgard. Thanks to his reckless arrogance, he is stripped of his strength and cast out from his home world, forced to live as a mere mortal on the planet known as Earth. Before he can regain his hammer and his power, he must overcome his faults, thus proving that he is fit to be king. Thor's comic book plot and over-the-top fantasy could have made it unrelatable, but Chris Hemsworth's grounding performance saves it from such a fate. He's chiseled enough to fill schoolgirls' dreams, but more importantly, he really nails this role. He manages to be spoiled and conceited, yet charming. He is a powerful prince and warrior but somehow hilarious. By the end of the film, he's the kind of hero you love to root for. And then there's Natalie Portman, every nerd's dream. She's as cute as always here, but unfortunately her character is not particularly relevant.In fact, Earth itself isn't particularly relevant. Most of the movie takes place on Asgard, the Asgardians are the main characters, and all the drama and conflict is between their world and J&ouml;tunheim, land of the evil frost giants. Earth is involved only tangentially, connected to these other realms by Yggdrasil, the world tree. A whole bunch of mythology is thrown at us, and though I tried my best to catch it, a great deal went over my head. Although I liked all the Asgardians simply because they were attractive and wore shiny clothing, I found it a bit hard to care about them when my old standby, humanity, was left out of the mix. I mean, Earth is never even in any danger! The trailers make it look like all sorts of evil creatures are going to start flooding our cities, threatening to destroy us with robots that shoot fire from their faces. In reality, only one villain ever comes to Earth to destroy anything. And in fact, its only purpose is to capture Thor--it's got nothing against us puny humans!And man are we puny. Natalie Portman's apprentice tazes Thor, but that's about the most any of us evolved apes does. Portman herself is just in the movie as a shallow love interest to fulfill the hero-learns-humility-by-falling-in-love trope. Not to say that I wouldn't fall for her immediately, but Thor spends only one or two days on Earth, and there are very few scenes of him and Portman interacting at all. He does appeal to the scientist in her, however, saying ""The answers you seek shall be yours, once I claim what is mine."" (Which, incidentally, is how I'm going to be hitting on all women from now on.) Their romance just didn't hold water for me, especially since [Minor Spoiler Alert] the movie ends with them worlds apart, longing for each other. There simply wasn't enough time for their relationship to go from whirlwind romance to the ""I'll spend my life searching for a way to travel through space so we can be together"" phase. [End Spoiler Alert]While those faults keep this movie from achieving true greatness, they certainly don't prevent it from being basically awesome. Thor is a great character, the other worlds are breathtaking, and there's a good balance of action and comedy. Plus, Heimdall, the gatekeeper of Asgard, is undeniably badass; he wields a giant golden sword, sports a matching horned helmet, and has bright orange eyes that can see across the cosmos. Also, he's literally immune to being frozen to death.The only actually bad part of the movie was when Thor supposedly dies. [Spoiler Alert] The main character DOES NOT DIE! I know it's shocking, but it's the truth. He's lying there, all dead like, and the camera just keeps lingering and lingering on a close up of his face. Finally, he grabs his hammer and surges back to life, more powerful than ever now that he's proven he's willing to sacrifice himself. The moment is painfully cheesy, and yet, somehow, I found myself cheering. [End Spoiler Alert]When it comes down to it, Thor is your basic superhero movie. Even though it's not too original and there's little sense of danger, the characters are eminently likable, the CGI is stunning, and the action is fun. It's a lighthearted film, and  unless you try to follow the mythology of it all, you won't have to think too hard.3.5/5 Most worthless character: Hogun, the token Asian Warrior.

The visuals were absolutely stunning. Hopkins was superb as Odin, I loved the twist on Norse mythology, and the supporting cast was very good as well, especially Kat Dennings (Darcy), who just about stole the show even with as little dialogue as she was given. Granted, it wasn't perfect. The biggest detractor was that the storyline was a bit weak in development. Thor changes from an egotistical hothead to someone willing to sacrifice himself for mortals because he was given the god-equivalent of being sent to his room for a day's worth of ""time-out""? I liked the character of Jane, but I saw very little of what it was about her character that inspired him to want to be more. I guess it could all be laid at the feet of love-at-first-sight, but I was hoping for something less vague. If she'd shown an indominable spirit or overwhelming compassion, it would have made a little more sense. Still, it was an enjoyable romp.The only reason I didn't give it four stars was b/c of the quality of the dvd I received. I'd first seen this movie in the theater, and thank goodness I did....otherwise I wouldn't have been able to follow along. I couldn't see a thing! The full daylight scenes were o.k., but everything that took place beneath Asgard or on the ice giants' world was nothing but shadow and voices. I adjusted my television's color in countless variations and nothing improved. Tv was working fine...I saw drastic lightening and darkening when I adjusted while watching cable or another dvd. It was like AvP: Requiem all over again. Which is a pity because the visuals are one of the best features of this film.

When Thor's misguided actions cause the end of an unsteady peace between the Asgard and Frost Giants, King Odin banishes Thor to Earth. Thor is found by scientist Jane Foster who studies the skies. Without his powers, Thor is forced to live as a mortal and learn what it means to be a true hero.Chris Hemsworth takes on the iconic role of Thor, the god of thunder. Hemsworth not only looks the part of the blonde-haired, blue-eyed Nordic god, but he plays the part of haughty, spoiled young prince to perfection. Unlike most other superhero origin stories, Thor doesn't go through much physical change. Instead, he grows as a man and a champion for others, learning humility and self-sacrifice.They couldn't have found a better actor to play Odin. Anthony Hopkins shines in whatever he does, and as Asgard's wise and benevolent leader is no exception. And Thor's malicious and manipulative brother Loki is played by Tom Hiddleston to creepy perfection. Natalie Portman costars as Jane Foster, Thor's human love interest. I was skeptical at first, but the two did have great chemistry. And Jane's small team of scientists including Stellan Skarsgard and Dr. Selvig and Kat Dennings as Darcy added a fun dynamic of humor and simplicity. Whereas, Thor's friends from Asgard are a bit cartoonish and over-the-top.The main story takes place on both present day Earth and on Asgard, moving at a steady pace. At 1 hour 54 minutes long, I expected there to be some slower scenes or the story to be drawn out. Instead, it felt like the movie flew by, and it was suddenly over too soon. The action scenes were intense, with incredible special effects. The drama was balanced well with humor. Full of mystery, suspense, adventure, and a bit of romance - I loved every minute of Thor. Comic book and superhero fans of all ages will enjoy this cosmic adventure. I saw this sneak preview on a regular screen, but in 3-D.

1325147,A1C58YXM2A30CY,B0034G4P80,"Scotman's Film & Book Reviews ""Film & Book Re...","[3, 5]","I just got back from seeing Thor and thought it a fantastic yet emotional film, even better than Spider-man 2 or Iron-Man (two other excellent Marvel outings).Plots:I won't go too much into plot summary since that has already been done by other critics and writers on this site.  I will say that the general themes of arrogance and betrayal give way to love and honor in a way that I've only read in the actual Thor comics.Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, many years ago now, created their Marvel version of Norse mythology with Thor -- a brash, arrogant son of the mighty Odin (well-played by Anthony Hopkins).  The comics painted Thor as a man-god in dire need of humility.  And of Loki, adopted son, whose distinctive black hair and clever manner portend the story -- a jealous son who only desires the pride of his father.Father and Son:It has been pointed out that this is a father/son story.  True, but I'd take that a step further and say it's a story of family.  Odin, regardless of being the most powerful being in the Nine Worlds (yes, initial caps!) has two boys to take care of, to groom to be worthy of king.Thor, after screwing up with the Frost Giants' world, is banished to Earth. There we meet Jane Foster, a scientist studying the wormholes she suspects are there, and her friend Darcy who is studying Thor's abs.Humor:There is enough to go around but is certainly not the slapstick humor of the Green Hornet film!  Loki's apparent regard for his father and the build-up of his betrayal was well-played and smooth.Thor's now-depowered body takes a beating and he finally comes to realize his own faults and arrogance.  But his dealings with the hospital staff, his fights with SHIELD, and his growing friendship with Jane, show that he is human after all.Fights:The Frost Giant's battle, the defeat of the guardian of the Rainbow Bridge, Heimdall, and the camaraderie and battle with the other comics characters (Sif, and the Warriors Three) were nearly directly out of the comics story, but it was not ""comic bookie"" if you know what I mean.  Not a lot of explosions, just some honest swordplay and kick-butt action!Easter Eggs:Only fans would have spotted a few things that are not a deep part of the story at all, but just a nod to fans.  The first man to try to pull the magical hammer, Mjolnir, from the ground was none other than J. Michael Stracynski, author of this film (whose been writing some great comics scripts lately and is also author of the former TV series, Babylon 5).  Another is the inevitable Stan Lee appearance.  And Jane Foster's former boyfriend (only mentioned,  never seen) is ""Donald Blake"" *(which is the comics was Thor's alter-ego).There's a scene after the credits are done.  Be sure you wait for it.  The excellent soundtrack will keep you rocking up to that point.Changes:I really appreciate a film that does not require early comics knowledge to understand what's going on.  I truly feel anyone who enjoys some decent fantasy, with its codes of honor and loyalty will greatly love this film.  There are several changes from the comics, but it does not matter.  It's all good!Bottom Line:Straightforward, not too pretentious.  We get our quota of subtle bad guys, unstoppable forces and immovable objects, and the story moves along without being rushed or having any real boring pauses.  I mean even Thor makes breakfast!  A must-see.Other Marvel Movies for the Marvelites, Past & Possible:Iron Man (Ultimate Two-Disc Edition + BD Live) [Blu-ray]Hulk (Widescreen 2-Disc Special Edition)Spider-Man 2 (Widescreen Special Edition)Great Cast!Directed by:Kenneth BranaghProduced by:Avi AradKevin FeigeScreenwriter:Mark ProtosevichZack StentzCast:Tom Hiddleston ...

1325148,AJ7SBFCIXPJM1,B0034G4P80,"Scot Merideth Peirson ""Scot Peirson""","[1, 1]","With ""The Avengers"" due for release in 2012, there might have been a temptation on the part of Marvel Films to not be thorough with the two releases of 2011, ""Thor"" and ""Captain America: The First Avenger"".  The first of the two releases...did much to eliminate that line of thinking.""Thor"" plays well on two levels--as a story of intrigue and betrayal among Norse Gods, it seems as if it is ""Hamlet"" on steroids; but carries some moments of surprising humor and pathos.  The humor strikes many who have known the Marvel character as surprising--after all, Thor and the fellow Asgardians have been primarily known for their Elizabethan English (The usage of ""thee"" and ""thou"") and Thor's own rather severe nature.  Which is why credit must be given first and foremost to Kenneth Branagh.  Branagh has certainly had a history with The Bard's works, having directed ""Henry V"" in 1989 and ""Hamlet"" in 1996.  Certainly the Asgard part of the story--Thor's ascension to King of Asgard subverted by his half-brother Loki, and Loki's ascension to Odin's throne--plays as a Shakespearean tale...But the earthbound part of the story--Thor's banishment to Earth, developing his relationship with the astrophysicist Jane Foster, and learning that a true leader will make sacrifices for the greater good--comes in a part of the tale which is at points humorous (If not laugh-out-loud funny), touching...almost endearing in many ways; while mixing in the action that superhero movies have to have.Branagh mixes both elements of his Shakespearean training and more traditional leanings quite well here, and creates a very good introductory story.Of course, it helps that the cast doesn't sleepwalk this out.  Chris Hemsworth pulls a magnificent double in this movie (For that matter, Hemsworth and his wife--Elsa Pataky, who played the Brazilian police liasion to Dewayne Johnson in ""Fast Five""--probably rolled in a bunch of money this past summer).  Hemsworth captures a headstrong, willful, quick-to-anger warrior at the start; when cast out of Asgard without his powers he comes off as arrogant and spoiled--and maybe a little bit touched--but grows in the story.  But Hemsworth also provides charm and a pretty good gift for physical comedy that enhances the characterization.Tom Hiddleston's Loki steals the show.  It is a brilliantly nuanced character that plays all sides against each other for his benefit, but Hiddleston gives the character a unique soul--angered at his origins and feeling deprived of his birthright, and willing to take out his anger on both his Asgardian family and the Frost Giants.Anthony Hopkins and Rene Russo bring regality and power to Odin and Frigga--it is particularly nice to see Russo back at work after about a ten-year absence...Stellan Skarsgard plays Erik Selvig with a bemused look, but honest concern for Jane Foster; and Kat Dennings is a riot as Darcy Lewis.  Among Thor's fellow warrior gods, Jaimie Alexander's Sif is a delight--she seems to lead the Warriors Three (Including Ray Stevenson's Volstagg--Stevenson seems on course to become a member of ""The Mighty Marvel Movie Players"", people who have done different roles in Marvel movies, since he played Frank Castle in ""Punisher: War Zone...).Natalie Portman's Jane Foster is notable..touching, and brilliant.  Given that it follows her dark turn in ""Black Swan"", Portman has to call on a lightness and humor that hasn't been seen much with her.  Her Jane is a brilliant woman with a bad dating history, and when she has Hemsworth's Thor drop out of the sky onto her RV, she's a little overwhelmed by the mystery and the slightly imperious (Though charming) behavior.  The key sequence of the movie--when Thor proves himself a hero worthy of Mjolnir, the mighty hammer--is Portman at her best; sad at Thor's initial sacrifice to The Destroyer, but her shock at what happens when the hammer returns to Thor--her ""Oh...my...god??!?"" is priceless, as is her comments about Thor's usual clothing after defeating The Destroyer.  To paraphrase that line, Jane is a good look on Natalie.Notable among the special features is the ""one-shot"" where Clark Gregg's Phil Coulson, the SHIELD operative from the Iron Man movies does a little manipulating in a side-story (Which also explains a scene from ""The Incredible Hulk""...).Again, Marvel Films could have been very sloppy with this story, figuring that nothing really counts until the summer of 2012.  But Kenneth Branagh didn't allow that, Chris Hemsworth couldn't allow that, and Natalie Portman wouldn't allow that.Highly recommended.",4,"Thor--Shakespearean, Light...And Well Done...",1325116800,"12 29, 2011",2011,4570,"['Avengers', 'due', 'release', '2012', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'temptation', 'part', 'Marvel', 'Films', 'not', 'be', 'two', 'releases', '2011', 'Thor', 'Captain', 'America', 'First', 'Avenger', 'first', 'two', 'releases', 'did', 'much', 'eliminate', 'line', 'thinking', 'Thor', 'well', 'two', 'levels', 'story', 'intrigue', 'betrayal', 'Norse', 'Gods', 'Hamlet', 'steroids', 'moments', 'surprising', 'humor', 'pathos', 'humor', 'many', 'who', 'have', 'known', 'Marvel', 'character', 'surprising', 'Thor', 'fellow', 'Asgardians', 'have', 'been', 'primarily', 'known', 'Elizabethan', 'English', 'usage', 'thee', 'thou', 'Thor', 'own', 'rather', 'severe', 'nature', 'Which', 'why', 'credit', 'must', 'be', 'given', 'first', 'foremost', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'Branagh', 'certainly', 'had', 'history', 'Bard', 'works', 'having', 'directed', 'Henry', 'V', '1989', 'Hamlet', '1996', 'Certainly', 'Asgard', 'part', 'story', 'Thor', 'ascension', 'King', 'Asgard', 'subverted', 'half-brother', 'Loki', 'Loki', 'ascension', 'Odin', 'throne', 'Shakespearean', 'tale', 'earthbound', 'part', 'story', 'Thor', 'banishment', 'Earth', 'developing', 'relationship', 'astrophysicist', 'Jane', 'Foster', 'learning', 'true', 'leader', 'will', 'make', 'sacrifices', 'greater', 'good', 'part', 'tale', 'points', 'humorous', 'not', 'laugh-out-loud', 'funny', 'touching', 'almost', 'endearing', 'many', 'ways', 'mixing', 'action', 'superhero', 'movies', 'have', 'have.Branagh', 'mixes', 'elements', 'Shakespearean', 'training', 'more', 'traditional', 'leanings', 'quite', 'well', 'here', 'very', 'good', 'introductory', 'story.Of', 'course', 'cast', ""n't"", 'sleepwalk', 'out', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'magnificent', 'double', 'movie', 'matter', 'Hemsworth', 'wife', 'Elsa', 'Pataky', 'who', 'played', 'Brazilian', 'police', 'liasion', 'Dewayne', 'Johnson', 'Fast', 'Five', 'probably', 'rolled', 'bunch', 'money', 'past', 'summer', 'Hemsworth', 'headstrong', 'willful', 'quick-to-anger', 'warrior', 'start', 'when', 'cast', 'Asgard', 'powers', 'off', 'arrogant', 'spoiled', 'maybe', 'little', 'bit', 'touched', 'grows', 'story', 'Hemsworth', 'also', 'charm', 'pretty', 'good', 'gift', 'physical', 'comedy', 'characterization.Tom', 'Hiddleston', 'Loki', 'show', 'brilliantly', 'nuanced', 'character', 'sides', 'other', 'benefit', 'Hiddleston', 'character', 'unique', 'soul', 'angered', 'origins', 'feeling', 'deprived', 'birthright', 'willing', 'take', 'out', 'anger', 'Asgardian', 'family', 'Frost', 'Giants.Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Rene', 'Russo', 'bring', 'regality', 'power', 'Odin', 'Frigga', 'particularly', 'nice', 'see', 'Russo', 'back', 'work', 'ten-year', 'absence', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgard', 'Erik', 'Selvig', 'bemused', 'look', 'honest', 'concern', 'Jane', 'Foster', 'Kat', 'Dennings', 'riot', 'Darcy', 'Lewis', 'Thor', 'fellow', 'warrior', 'gods', 'Jaimie', 'Alexander', 'Sif', 'delight', 'lead', 'Warriors', 'Three', 'Including', 'Ray', 'Stevenson', 'Volstagg', 'Stevenson', 'course', 'become', 'member', 'Mighty', 'Marvel', 'Movie', 'Players', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'done', 'different', 'roles', 'Marvel', 'movies', 'played', 'Frank', 'Castle', 'Punisher', 'War', 'Zone', '.Natalie', 'Portman', 'Jane', 'Foster', 'notable..touching', 'brilliant', 'Given', 'dark', 'turn', 'Black', 'Swan', 'Portman', 'call', 'lightness', 'humor', ""n't"", 'been', 'seen', 'much', 'Jane', 'brilliant', 'woman', 'bad', 'dating', 'history', 'when', 'Hemsworth', 'Thor', 'drop', 'sky', 'RV', 'little', 'overwhelmed', 'mystery', 'slightly', 'imperious', 'charming', 'behavior', 'key', 'sequence', 'movie', 'when', 'Thor', 'hero', 'worthy', 'Mjolnir', 'mighty', 'hammer', 'Portman', 'best', 'sad', 'Thor', 'initial', 'sacrifice', 'Destroyer', 'shock', 'what', 'when', 'hammer', 'returns', 'Thor', 'Oh', 'god', 'priceless', 'comments', 'Thor', 'usual', 'clothing', 'defeating', 'Destroyer', 'paraphrase', 'line', 'Jane', 'good', 'look', 'Natalie.Notable', 'special', 'features', 'one-shot', 'where', 'Clark', 'Gregg', 'Phil', 'Coulson', 'SHIELD', 'operative', 'Iron', 'Man', 'movies', 'little', 'manipulating', 'side-story', 'Which', 'also', 'scene', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', '.Again', 'Marvel', 'Films', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'sloppy', 'story', 'figuring', 'nothing', 'really', 'summer', '2012', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'did', ""n't"", 'allow', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'could', ""n't"", 'allow', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'would', ""n't"", 'allow', 'that.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

1325153,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B0034G4P80,Scott Schiefelbein,"[0, 0]","In Kenneth Branagh's 1995 film ""A Midwinter's Tale,"" low-rent actors labor furiously to stage Hamlet, and one of the funniest subplots involves ""the cuts."" Shakespeare's plays can hold about four hours of story, but modern audiences lack Elizabethan attention spans. But what can be cut, and who the heck do you think you are, editing Shakespeare?""Thor"" offers the opposite problem -- Branagh must stretch about 40 minutes of worthy story into a summer blockbuster. (Norse gods do not do short subject.) The good half of the movie takes place on Asgard, which is in another galaxy, or on another astral plane, or some such charming nonsense. Thor's father, Odin (Anthony Hopkins), rules wisely after having defeated the gods' longtime enemies, the Frost Giants of Jotunheim, in a battle which gave Scandinavia its Norse legends and the Tea Party an explanation for the Ice Age.Then, in a Shakespearean development, Odin must choose his heir between two seemingly worthy sons: the warrior Thor (Chris Hemsworth, perfectly cast) and the cunning Loki (Tom Hiddleston). When his coronation is interrupted by Frost Giants, who are trying to steal back a holy relic taken from them, the mighty Thor defies his dad and leads a magnificent raid on Jotunheim that shreds the delicate peace Odin had built. For his hubris, Odin banishes the unrepentant Thor to Earth and breaks the bond between Thor and his magic hammer, which lies like Excalibur in the New Mexico desert.The Asgard part of the movie is first-rate popcorn entertainment, full of terrific special effects and PG-13-level good-versus-evil bashing. In New Mexico, the story flags and is only maintained by the strength of the actors. Natalie Portman, Stellan Skarsgard, and Kat Dennings ably play three scientists who aid the banished Thor. These threadbare characters exist solely for plot development, but Skarsgard is particularly effective as a scientist who was raised on Norse legends, but who gave up those childish stories long ago.Fanboys who sit through the closing credits will delight in a final scene that explains the real point of this movie, which is to integrate Thor into the Avengers, the gang of Marvel Comics superheroes that includes Iron Man, Captain America, and Green Lantern. Thor falls far short of the bar set by Christopher Nolan's epic ""The Dark Knight,"" but its sights were lower. He may not be Shakespeare's Prince Harry, but Thor deserves a full two hours of story next time around.Review originally published on MyDVDInsider.com.",4,A solid PG-13 creation myth for another future Avenger,1317081600,"09 27, 2011",2011,2518,"['Kenneth', 'Branagh', '1995', 'film', 'Midwinter', 'Tale', 'low-rent', 'actors', 'labor', 'furiously', 'stage', 'Hamlet', 'one', 'funniest', 'subplots', 'cuts', 'Shakespeare', 'plays', 'can', 'hold', 'four', 'hours', 'story', 'modern', 'audiences', 'lack', 'Elizabethan', 'attention', 'spans', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'cut', 'who', 'heck', 'do', 'think', 'are', 'editing', 'Shakespeare', 'Thor', 'opposite', 'problem', 'Branagh', 'must', 'stretch', '40', 'minutes', 'worthy', 'story', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'Norse', 'gods', 'do', 'not', 'do', 'short', 'subject', 'good', 'half', 'movie', 'place', 'Asgard', 'galaxy', 'astral', 'plane', 'such', 'charming', 'nonsense', 'Thor', 'father', 'Odin', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'rules', 'wisely', 'having', 'defeated', 'gods', 'longtime', 'enemies', 'Frost', 'Giants', 'Jotunheim', 'battle', 'gave', 'Scandinavia', 'Norse', 'legends', 'Tea', 'Party', 'explanation', 'Ice', 'Age.Then', 'Shakespearean', 'development', 'Odin', 'must', 'choose', 'heir', 'two', 'seemingly', 'worthy', 'sons', 'warrior', 'Thor', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'cunning', 'Loki', 'Tom', 'Hiddleston', 'When', 'coronation', 'interrupted', 'Frost', 'Giants', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'steal', 'back', 'holy', 'relic', 'taken', 'mighty', 'Thor', 'dad', 'magnificent', 'raid', 'Jotunheim', 'delicate', 'peace', 'Odin', 'had', 'built', 'hubris', 'Odin', 'unrepentant', 'Thor', 'Earth', 'breaks', 'bond', 'Thor', 'magic', 'hammer', 'Excalibur', 'New', 'Mexico', 'Asgard', 'part', 'movie', 'first-rate', 'popcorn', 'entertainment', 'full', 'terrific', 'special', 'effects', 'PG-13-level', 'good-versus-evil', 'bashing', 'New', 'Mexico', 'story', 'flags', 'only', 'maintained', 'strength', 'actors', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgard', 'Kat', 'Dennings', 'ably', 'play', 'three', 'scientists', 'who', 'aid', 'banished', 'Thor', 'threadbare', 'characters', 'exist', 'solely', 'plot', 'development', 'Skarsgard', 'particularly', 'effective', 'scientist', 'who', 'was', 'raised', 'Norse', 'legends', 'who', 'gave', 'up', 'childish', 'stories', 'long', 'ago.Fanboys', 'who', 'sit', 'closing', 'credits', 'will', 'delight', 'final', 'scene', 'real', 'point', 'movie', 'integrate', 'Thor', 'Avengers', 'gang', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Captain', 'America', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'Thor', 'far', 'short', 'bar', 'set', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'epic', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'sights', 'were', 'lower', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'Shakespeare', 'Prince', 'Harry', 'Thor', 'full', 'two', 'hours', 'story', 'next', 'time', 'around.Review', 'originally', 'published', 'MyDVDInsider.com']",N/A

Thor travels to Earth to redeem them but finds out he's not the same Thor he was before.There was nothing super original about the plot, and of course (as with most superhero style films) there was a romantic interest. He also had sidekicks, although I couldn't convince myself the female sidekick was as bad as she tried to look. I was never quite convinced she was right for that role.

1325177,A3KKM0T1KY42HA,B0034G4P80,Sky,"[1, 1]","I remember thinking that Thor couldn't possibly be a cool character. He just seemed like such a farfetched and unrealistic part of the Marvel superhero family. He didn't fit in; he was mythology, not Marvel. That was until sometime back in 2008 when I read all 800 pages combined of Mark Millar's epic collections ofThe Ultimates&The Ultimates 2. Those books were nothing short of amazing, and those books introduced me to the Marvel gang in a whole new light, especially Thor. Thor quickly became one of my favorite Marvel characters after reading Millar's books. Chris Hemsworth plays Thor and does the character supreme justice. Kenneth Branagh directs and together the entire cast and crew turn out one excellent film.For starting a war of the realms in the first 20 or so minutes of the movie, Thor is banished to Earth by his father (Anthony Hopkins), the King of Asgard, leaving Thor's brother Loki as the potential heir to the throne. And something's not quite right with Loki. With the help of mainly Natalie Portman, Thor must find redemption and once again become a worthy defender of Asgard. There's one catch: in Thor's banishment he was stripped of Mjolnir, his all-powerful Hammer that also holds his superpowers.Much of the movie is spent making a ""good guy"" out of Thor after a relatively rough introduction to his character. In the end it's all worth it, because you're really rooting for him by the film's finale. And the after credits scene suggests that Thor will have no minor part in 2012's Avengers film. So Thor 2011 is a successful and exciting intro the character for events yet to happen in a future film(s).Joss Whedon is writing and directing The Avengers and I'm not sure whether his plan is to follow Mark Millar's storyline.

Terrible writing, casting, knowledge of the basic Norse religion, basic geography, basic ethnicity of the Norsemen, or for that matter not even a basic knowledge of the comic books. The guy playing Thor is fine. Anthony Hopkins is overrated as usual. Humongous errors in logic and historical storyline. I guess the bottom line, is letting Hollywood make a movie about the Norsemen and their heroes is best left to the people actually from that country.With regards to casting, aside for whether Anthony Hopkins is overrated or not, the casting for this movie was pretty racist. I mean c'mon, Asgard was about the Norse gods. Hello?! Norse Gods here?!  Casting the Norse god Heimdall (Guardian of the Rainbow Bridge) with an black-skinned actor is simply racism at it's worst. What's next? A remake of Braveheart, but we find out he was really Taiwanese? A remake of Zulu, but this time one of the tribesmen is a Eskimo? A biography of Muhammed Ali as played by Matt Damon? Certainly, much as in the 1930's there was the Hays code which regulated morality in movies, and today we are about the same with having the diversity regulations. But if you wanted diversity, just make the Earth characters whatever quota of diversity you want. Let me guess, in the remake of the Wizard of Oz, Toto this time is actually going to be a poodle.Oh...now I recall, in the new remake of Bambi, Thumper wasn't tough enough for today's crowds per Hollywood. This time Thumper is going to be a tattooed, rip-muscled, butt-kicking, mixed martial arts-using wabbitt who puts down anyone who tries to pick on Bambi.And what's all the nonsense about Odin wanting to make Thor King of Asgard? What? Odin is king of Asgard! It make absolutely no sense that there's some sort of chance for Thor to be king of Asgard, it's just ridiculous. Odin is king of the gods, hello?

It was good to see the Warriors Three in the film.Asgard has a great look. It's very Jack Kirby. Stan Lee makes his traditional cameo.

Yes, it bothers me. But it doesn't affect the movie itself. The main flaw with movie is a bit of waffling with the character of Thor. He vacillates between being confused about Earth and seeming to not know where he is or what's going on to being very wise about Earth and the ways of man.

1325198,A2KVUYPLEW4LXT,B0034G4P80,"Strategos ""The Guardian of Time""","[2, 2]","I remember when this film came out in the theater I couldn't get anyone to watch it with me. Half of them thought it looked stupid and the other half thought it would be some mystical/magical thing and that really turned them off. But the reviews were positive and something...made me want to give it a chance.After seeing this film I was not just pleasantly surprised, I was genuinely amazing by how much better it was than it could have been. Whenever you get into a story that blurs the lines of the real world and a fantasy world, you are treading on dangerous ground. On the one hand if it's too realistic it comes across as odd, cheesy, and boring. If you go to far on the fantasy side it starts to feel like a cartoon with no dramatic real-world weight. But this film manages to walk the line, and walk it well.Critics can laugh and poke fun at the worlds of Thor all they want, but in the end, they are believable within the universe the film creates, and have depth beyond the spectacular battles and scenery-chewing of it's characters. And this springs from a genuinely heartfelt simple story of a fish-out-of-water who grows up.At the start of the film, it is quickly established that Thor is a good-hearted, hard-fighting, handsome, and shallow being who only wants glory and is quick to lose his temper. After making a series of horribly selfish errors in judgement, he is banished to Midgard, the realm of humans, where he meets a team of scientists and hilarity ensues. There is no plot in the human world, only gentle character-building as Thor interacts with others, and slowly loses his arrogance through coming to build real relationships with ordinary people.His mischief-causing brother is naturally up-to-no-good at the same time, and Thor has to grow as a person in time to save-the-day back home. What makes this extraordinary is the incredible sincerity that is brought to the character of Thor. When his transformation is complete, and he truly becomes WORTHY to wield the power he was born to, it is a great moment in comic book films indeed.All of this is aided by better-than-usual special effects (the other realms are so pretty your irises want to weep), great music, and witty, well-written dialog combined with good-natured humor.In the end, this film was handled just about perfectly. The only small downside I can see is that the Arizona sets look a bit low budget compared to everything else (not bad, just a little too made-for-TV). I highly recommend this film to anyone who is fan of comic books or comic book films, and even moreso to anyone anyone who is a sci-fi/fantasy fan and appreciates a well-made film.",5,"""Your ancestors called it magic and you call it science.

And who cares if Kenneth Branagh has lowered himself to doing Marvel Comics adaptations after having once been in the lofty heights of producing Shakespearean theatre - the film has everything you'd find in a Shakespeare production, including battle helmets and cod pieces. Chris Helmsworth makes a great Thor (blonde, big, lots of doughy muscles and a bit dopey to match), Anthony Hopkins makes a great Odin (grim, imperious and iron-hearted), and Tom Hiddleston makes a great Loki (sneaky, slinky and possessed of a wicked grin). Like most other Marvel Comics movie adaptations, this one bears a lot of similarity with the original comic, while also diverging from it. Sure, Jane Foster was Marvel's most boring character in the original '60s comics, while in the year 2011 she's become an astrophysicist played by Natalie Portman (?!?), and we can skip (for the most part) that whole Dr Donald Blake thing - make fun of it, even - and just carry on with our day.  Hooray!  Thor gets banished to Midgard (our muddy old Earth) and he makes friend (and lovers) with his charm. He confronts some sort of destroyer drone, then goes nutso on heaven and earth in a war on sneaky ice demons. Great fun. Still, though, I don't know who the actor Stellan Skarsgrd is, nor the film character he plays called ""Erik Selvig."" Is he important?

1325223,A1QRXEM0WSLGT5,B0034G4P80,The Man With No Name,"[5, 10]","(Much Overdue Review Of Movie)Well, now that the 'Avengers' has hit theaters and getting rave reviews, I decided it was time to get my 'Thor' review submitted.  FYI, I haven't seen 'Avengers' yet, but WILL be seeing it next week.  So far it's getting AMAZING reviews and I have high hopes for it.  Is it possible the movie studios are not butchering super-hero movies anymore?  Here's hoping...Anywho...I myself watched 'Thor' on the big screen last summer, and rewatched it this last weekend on television.  Call me crazy, but this film almost seems to get better after multiple viewings.  Does the film have it's flaws, YES.  Is it more of a prequel and less of a stand alone movie, ABSOLUTELY.  But despite this it still has some solid action and is quite necessary to watch before viewing the 'Avengers'.**(Warning, Some Spoilers Ahead, In Case You Haven't Seen This Yet...)**--Story/Premise--The film begins with a brief flashback of the Norse God Odin (Anthony Hopkins) coming down to Midgar, aka Earth, and defending it from a Frost Giant invasion.  He loses his right eye during these battles and saves Earth from an induced ice age.  Flashing forward we get to see Thor and Loki as children getting educated by their father in the armery.  We see Thor's hammer Mjolnir sitting there long before Thor begins to wield it.Well...Thor grows up and is about to have the kingship of Asgard transferred to him, when a covert Frost Giant attack occurs.  Odin summons the Destroyer to dispatch the invaders and they are fryed instantly.  It appeared the attackers were after (The Casket Of Ancient Winters.)  (-Source Wikipedia)This angers Thor tremendously and he wants to go confront them in their own realm.  Odin forbids this and leaves Thor, his will clear.  He also reminds Thor he is not king yet.  Long story short, Thor and his companions and Loki travel to Jotunheim and a HUGE battle ensues.  Thor fights, and probably kills, numerous Frost Giants AND some huge Frost Giant monster.  The Asgardians are still outnumbered and would have died, until Odin appears and stops the fight.  But...the damage is done, and Jotunheim says the truce with Asgard has been broken, thus war will be coming.Odin and Thor and his warriors return to Asgard through the Bifrost.  Thor's vanity and immaturity peak here and he insults Odin one too many times.  Odin in anger strips him of his powers, makes him mortal, and enchanted Mjolnir so that only a worthy person can wield it.  He then banishes Thor to Earth.For anyone who watches 'Iron-Man 2' past the end credits, you would have seen Thor's hammer in the ground in New Mexico.  This scene is in this film also.  Also, FYI, there are posts going around that you can see Thor in the 'Incredible Hulk' movie.  I can't confirm this though.  Apparently there is a random bolt of lighting in the background in the movie.  It's at the end where the Hulk and the Abomination are fighting.  Some claim this is the part where Thor is sent to Earth by Odin.  Who knows...pop in your copy and watch for it and you decide.I personally found the banishment portion of the film quite slow and feel it hurt the movie overall.  It does serve a purpose, it humbles Thor and makes him care for Midgar.  Still though, when you pay to see action and you have 20 minutes of no action, you feel cheated.The film does get back on track, Thor proves himself worthy and gets his grove back.  Loki's deceiving is revealed and after a pretty cool fight falls into a wormhole.  Of course he survives and is set up to become the main villain in the 'Avengers'.--After Credits Clip--For those who watch after the credits, there is once again a Sam Jackson clip.  The clip is quite crucial to see.  It contains the Cosmic Cube, the blue cube from 'Captain America', and will be the primary focus in the 'Avengers'.  We also see that Loki is here on Earth now and is manipulating Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard).--Character/Casting Decisions--(Chris Hemsworth as Thor):  Great decision in my opinion.  Hemsworth looks like Thor and really gave this role 100 percent.  I first remember seeing him as Capt. Kirk's dad in the 'Star Trek' revamp.  He's the one who stays with the ship and crashed it into the Romulan ship, saving a lot of federation lives.  I personally think Chris's attempt at a Norse accent is a success.  Not too strong, but dominating when called for.  It is also obvious that he packed on the muscle for the role, and combined with the AMAZING costume, nailed the part.  I have high hopes for his part in the 'Avengers' and believe his character will get a lot of screen time.(Anthony Hopkins as Odin):  Another good decision.  An actor we have all loved for years, I mean who hasn't seen 'Silence of the Lambs' at one time or another.  I was actually surprised he accepted the role.  Hopkins usually sticks with thrillers and horrors or dramas.  A super-hero film seemed out of place for him.  But...I'm glad he did take it.  Hopkins also looks the part.  I am disappointed he did not have his ravens much in the film.  This is a defining feature of this character, not having his ravens was a bad call.  Still, nothing worth rasing too much of a fuss about.  Overall a good performance by Sir Anthony Hopkins.(Tom Hiddleston as Loki):  I was not familier with this actor before seeing Thor, but I'm sure we all will be seeing more of him now.  If I had to rank which actor gave the BEST performance, he would be number 1 in the film.  First of he looks the part.  Second he actually wears his signature helmet with those long horns.  Thor wears his helmet once the entire film!!!  Hiddleston is able to go from one side of the emotional spectrum to other with the snap of a finger.  He gave off a creepy vibe sometimes as well, you really felt like this was someone you couldn't trust.  His whole confliction when he discovers he is a Frost Giant was pulled off fantastic.  You find yourself the viewer feeling for him one minute, and wanting Thor to bash his skull in the next.  I am confidant he will be a GREAT villian in the 'Avengers' and can't wait to see his performance.There are other actors in this film, but I have nor the space nor time to review them all.  I will say I don't believe Rene Russo added much to the movie.  Natalie Portman was OKAY, but not stellar, in my opinion.  Lady Sif and the Warriors Three were overall good, I hope to see more of them someday as well.--Various Home Releases--I personally will be buying the Blu-Ray/DVD combo-pack here soon.  I don't have a Blu-Ray player yet, but I can still watch the DVD.  However when I do finally upgrade, I'll already have the Blu-Ray.  FYI, it appears the Blu-Ray has the most special features and deleted scenes.  DVD's are on their way out, and anymore get only the most basic of special features.There is a 3D Blu-Ray release of this.  I personally don't like 3D movies though.  I already wear eyeglasses, so trying to wear another pair of glasses over them is a mess.  Also, I got a huge headache from watching 'Tron: Legacy' in 3D and swore of 3D movies forever after that experience.  Bottom line, if your a fan of 3D movies, your in luck, they have released this movie in 3D.  Now all you need is the expensive 3D tv and expensive 3D Blu-Ray player...I would personally just go with the 2d Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack.--In Conclusion--An overall good film despite it's lull periods.  Good casting decisions for the major roles, and a good setup for the 'Avengers'.  A must watch if you plan to see the 'Avengers'.  Otherwise you may be a little lost going in.Marvel is finally making Fanboy's dreams come true.  Thank you Marvel, now if only DC Comics could get it's act together and give us something besides 'Batman' and 'Superman'...--References--1. 'Thor' (Film).2.

1325224,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B0034G4P80,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[8, 10]","Natalie Portman starts out the film as an astrophysicist in the New Mexico desert. There appears to be some kind of UFO crash, as apparently aliens have the ability to fly all over the planet without crashing, except New Mexico. The movie then flashes back to 985 AD in a heavily CG background as Asgard, led by Odin, aka Anthony Hopkins, is fighting the frost giants, who look like blue skinned versions of Freddie Kruger. They end up with a truce. During the coronation ceremony of Thor, a frost giant enters the realm of Asgard and disrupts the ceremony (why this was done at the time was a mystery). Thor in his passion leads a group of warriors to the planet of the frost giants to teach them a lesson. The simple touch of a frost giant freezes the skin like liquid nitrogen. This was great in 2D, I can only imagine what the CG graphics was like in 3D.Odin is upset with Thor and takes his hammer and powers. He banishes Thor who speeds to earth only to crash into Natalie Portman and company in the desert (beginning scene). A bad hammer pun and a taser later, Thor is on his way to medical. The hammer lands elsewhere in the desert and is lodged like the Sword in the Stone. A group of yokels gather to have a cook out and attempt to remove said hammer...until the FEDS show up.The film moves back and forth between events on earth and in Asgard, as Loki has assumed the throne of his ailing father. In order to convince the audience this is the real Thor, he speaks a Middle Earth style of English, making over frequent use of the word ""realm."" It works well as it allows him to flirt with Natalie Portman, who he thinks is the most clever person on the planet. (Isn't this one of the seven signs?) Perhaps the movie's biggest fault is that is attempts to link mythology, science fiction and science fact is such a way a 9 year old might buy it.Like good trekkies, Thor's friends come to earth to rescue him, because the needs of the one out weigh the needs of the many. They show up and are as conspicuous as Vikings in a credit card commercial. Memorable line: Stop! You are using unregistered weapons technology!""For me the story wasn't light enough. There were a few comic lines attempted to break up the seriousness of the film, but it needed more of them. I was hoping for something along the lines of Iron Man 1. Perhaps the worst I have seen Ms. Portman in a while was her parsed OMG line. Other than that one bad line, she was great.No sex, no nudity, no f-bombs. Safe for the kiddies.

1325225,A2VUD4SPJO4V33,B0034G4P80,Theo,"[3, 5]","I can sum up what's wrong with this work very easily: it's the kind of film where characters do, say, and feel things because the script says they do. The most egregious example of this is the romantic sub-plot between Thor and Jane Foster. It's just sort of plopped in our laps that these two characters who've only just met are now madly in love.Are they? Well gee. How about that, huh?There are also problems with the visual design of the film. I'm particularly thinking here of the sets and costuming. To be fair, they started out with the right idea, taking their cues directly from Jack Kirby's original work on the Marvel comic book version of Thor. But while the idea may have been great, the execution was profoundly uninspired. Just as any mediocre art student can ""copy"" van Gogh's style up to a point, these people have copied Kirby... up to a point. But that spark of something exceptional that allowed Kirby to truly add to the visual language of our culture - it's just not there. The electrifying energy and well-nigh cosmic sense of portent that were such hallmarks of Kirby's work are nowhere to be found. In this film Loki's helm looks like exactly what it is: a chunk of plastic.In the end, I'd have to say that what's really wrong with the film is the same thing that's wrong with most superhero films: even though they hired a bunch of A-listers to pull it off, having been hired these people did not apparently see any real need to take what they were doing especially seriously.

1325249,A3GJGBF7FO8WDJ,B0034G4P80,"Tom Knapp ""Rambles.NET editor""","[3, 5]","When I first heard that the comic-book Thor was in line for cinematic treatment, I shuddered to think how truly awful that film would be. I assumed it would be hokey beyond compare, as the comic itself often is, and the announcement of Kenneth Branagh as director mollified my fears only slightly. So I was beyond pleased to see a film that actually took itself seriously, rose above its source material and gave us a story -- with all-around good performances from the cast -- that we could believe in.It's a shame, then, that the overall success had to be marred by an overabundance of cheesy special effects and a 3D transference that distracted more than it improved. From the start -- after a brief prelude that gave us a touch of humanity -- the movie presented well the arrogance of Thor, the nobility of Odin and the secretiveness of Loki ... and it looked more like a video game than a film. And it was good -- if I was talking about a video game, I'm be impressed and singing its praises. But as a movie -- the look was disappointing.For our pan-dimensional Norse gods, the beginning of the movie involves a host of fighting on a very large scale. First, there's a war on Earth, then Thor's ill-conceived journey to Jotunheim, with six gods against the full might of the frost giants. Then Thor (Chris Hemsworth, who's been working out since his memorable appearance on Star Trek) oversteps his bounds and is hurled to Earth for his hubris -- stripped of his powers and his magical hammer Mjolnir -- to learn humility. Then Odin (Anthony Hopkins) is incapacitated, leaving his dark son Loki (Tom Hiddleston) to rule in his place. And Loki, who was second choice to succeed the All-Father, wants to be sure Thor is never coming home.Meanwhile, on Earth, Thor makes the abrupt, bruising acquaintance of astrophysicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and her storm-chasing team, Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) and Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings). But when mystical hammers fall from the sky and imbed themselves, Excalibur-like, in the rock, you can be sure government spooks will soon be involved. Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) follows up his abrupt departure from Iron Man 2 to lead the operation here. He probably wasn't expecting to encounter a mindless Norse simulacrum that belches flame.Hemsworth has the difficult task of embodying a diety, and he handles the arrogance and power of his position well. Some might think he adapts to well and to easily to the modern human world he finds himself in, but I guess some guys will do just about anything for Portman. Sadly, although she too displays her usual skill, the romance between them feels flat, motivated by little more than, well, they're both hot, they're both there and there's no much else to do in a small New Mexico town.Back in Asgard, Hiddleston plays Loki as cooly, deliciously evil. But the big battle we all know is coming at the end looks and feels fake. Again, we're back to Thor's video-game world, and it throws the audience right out of the film.All in all, Thor succeeds more when it's working on a human level -- less flash, more substance. Still, the movie works simply because it's fun, and sometimes that's all you need in a comic-book movie.

1325252,A2UNMXBJSVIXFB,B0034G4P80,Tony Khamvongsouk,"[5, 7]","Movie - 4.5Much like the first Iron Man during its theatrical run, I had very little, if any, knowledge of this franchise going in. My expectations were set somewhat high by the success and entertainment value of said Iron Man films, but having only seen Chris Hemsworth once ever in any kind of movie and only knowing (not actually experiencing) any of Kenneth Branagh's directorial works I would say I expected to at least be entertained by the special effects and action sequences, if not any more of the small pepperings of Avengers references being thrown in for the eventual mishmash to come in just a year's time. First, I'd like to address the film's setting. On a personal level, I've enjoyed all kinds of genres throughout the years: sci-fi, fantasy, the supernatural, and all other kinds of ""unexplainability."" With that said, Thor pulls off the fantasy element in a surprisingly epic fashion. From the very get-go of the battle against the Frost Giants to the ornately decorated kingdom of Asgard and the lavish costuming of its warriors, I was captivated within minutes. Which isn't to say that the film is all looks. Very much so like the aforementioned first Iron Man, the plot has a strong focus on the ideas of power, humility, and responsibility (something a lot of superhero stories do, but it seems to be a popular style of storytelling, no?). Right before his crowning as new king of Asgard, Thor (Chris Hemsworth), comes to a point of such vanity and hubris, that his father, Odin (Anthony Hopkins), strips him of his power and banishes him to earth. And as you can guess, Thor will eventually learn his lesson of humility amongst humans, regain his power, and stop a usurping of his father's throne back in the homeland. Linear plot aside, it's not so much the story itself that manages to impress me, but the way and fashion in which it's told. Coming from quite the Shakespearean background, I would suffice it to say that Kenneth Branagh brings a refreshing kind of Thespian quality to the film's overall atmosphere which, for me, does wonders in terms of the acting, script, and character chemistry. Additionally, Natalie Portman, Stellan Skarsgrd, Kat Dennings, Jaimie Alexander, and Idris Elba give some good performances for what little screen time they have as well. And while the film clocks in at just under 2 hours, it probably could've used an extra 15-30 minutes for some better character development, but oh well.Video - 5.0- Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC- Video resolution: 1080p- Aspect ratio: 2.35:1- Original aspect ratio: 2.39:1The film was shot on 35mm but digitally processed, so it should go without saying that the transfer is flawless. A lot of the backgrounds on Asgard and Jotunheim are obviously CG'd, but as a result look absolutely stunning in HD. During it's theatrical run, I only got to see this in theaters on some dinky film projectors (once for the midnight premiere in an older Cinemark that didn't even have stadium seating, then a second time in an AMC with slightly newer projectors but still not near the quality of their digital ones). At any rate, after having the opportunity to sit down and see this in the comfort of my own home and in glorious Blu-ray, I have to say the cinematography is pure perfection. The shots in Jotunheim are particularly dark and as cold as the planet itself, but nary a bit of detail is lost. Black levels are especially well-accentuated and reveal a great amount of depth and delineation from Laufey's jagged and shadowed face down to the little cracks in the ice and even the line texturing of Thor's cape despite all that snow blowing around. When we get to Asgard the film's color scheme is most pronounced with lavish golds, silvers, and bronzes giving off a very shiny look. The lighting tends to feel slightly less natural in order to balance out the contrast for all the computer effects, but nonetheless blend together seamlessly for a very grandiose and ethereal stage design. In fact, a lot of the closeup shots are notably sharp; just look at the hair on the beards of Thor and Odin or the line detail in all the armor. Meanwhile, the shots on earth will probably look the best out of the lot. Aside from whatever visual effects they added in post-production during the action sequences or whatever, everything else in the little New Mexico town is as non-CG as can be and it results in a very fine and crisp picture. Natalie Portman never looked prettier. And if you're a girl, you'll be happy to know Chris Hemsworth's buffness really stands out, too.. Anyway, my favorite shots of the movie are the skirmish on Jotunheim for its incredible blacks and sustainable line detail, then the fight on the Bifr&ouml;st around the end of the film for its colors and excellent CG integration.Audio - 5.0Languages- English: DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1- French: Dolby Digital 5.1- Spanish: Dolby Digital 5.1- Portuguese: Dolby Digital 5.1Subtitles- English, English SDH, French, Spanish, PortugueseTo this point my 3 loudest BDs have been Hellboy II, Casino Royale, and Inception (which even blew out my sub-woofer at one point). Needless to say, I think I've found my new number one by a long shot. I keep reading that people say Thor's sound design / mixing is a little too aggressive for its own good, but I say bollocks. Not only does it make Thor the sonically captivating summer blockbuster it should be but I personally think it fits the theme ""god of thunder"" to a tee. LFEs are easily the best part of the track with booming and thunderous (and literally) ground-shaking rumbles that range from subtle to ""I can feel my butt vibrating."" From the very get-go of Odin fighting the Frost Giants on earth it's a pretty clear cut example of what to expect for the rest of the movie. And when Thor actually gets to Jotunheim to battle the Frost Giants himself its even crazier and louder than that. Discrete effects and separation are there, mind you, but holy crap does the placement and directionality really excel when fights break out. Dialogue stays clear and audible in the center with music and effects being dispersed evenly through the fronts. But my biggest delight is in the fact of how well-placed the rears and backs are in terms of their directionality. Normally, a 5.1 design would have you just at the edge of the ""sound bubble."" However, with 7.1 you're completely enveloped by sound every which way be it from the front, side, or behind. And because of that (in addition to the awesome design / mixing efforts of Michael Babcock and Anna Behlmer), we get a terrific soundscape that has truly brought the comic and legend to life. My favorite scenes would be the battle on Jotunheim (yet again) for its resounding bass, precision directionality, and overall vibrato, and of course, the battle on or any moment that the Bifr&ouml;st itself is activated. Or, for something a little less boisterous I'd recommend the scene where Thor is breaking into the S.H.E.I.L.D. compound to retrieve Mj&ouml;lner. There are some instances of thunder crackling in the night sky followed by some discretely-placed rainfall that sound pretty cool.Extras - 4.0I'm actually a little disappointed with the amount of behind-the-scenes footage, here. The movie felt very epic in scope and I was hoping it would've been as extensive as Iron Man with at least a second disc of extras approximating around 2 hours. Unfortunately, it only rounds out to something like 47 minutes without the Marvel One-Shot, Deleted Scenes, or Trailers.- Audio Commentary (Director Kenneth Branagh)This is only the first time I've heard him do one, but wow Branagh is really informative and knows his stuff. He covers just about everything else you wish they would've covered in the featurettes and does so in a very professional, yet open fashion. It's a quick-paced and brisk coverage of all things related to the film that tells you about: when he was approached to direct the film and what transpired, how he wanted to tell the story when making it, some of the thematic and symbolic ideas he wanted to display with the visuals, his experience with the actors, the prospect of filming in 3D and post-converting it, how they shot and came up with ideas for the visual effects, etc. There's hardly any dead space throughout and the man just keeps bombarding you with a plethora of factoids that are all prevalent to either the movie, the Marvel Universe, or to film-making in general. It's definitely worth a listen for fans of the film.- Marvel One-Shot: The Consultant (HD; 3:57)Presented in 1080p and Dolby Digital 5.1, this is a hilarious tie-in between some of the events of Iron Man 2 and The Incredible Hulk. We see Agent Coulson talking to Agent Sitwell about how the military is trying to push The Abomination as a candidate for the Avengers. Neither of them agree with the idea of putting him in, so they decide to sabotage negotiations with General Ross by sending ""The Consultant"" as a patsy to screw things up intentionally. It's short, but very much in the spirit of both Tony Stark and the comedic elements of the Marvel Movie Universe franchise thus far. Definitely give this a watch.Featurettes (HD; 46:59 altogether)- From Asgard to Earth (HD; 19:42)This covers a big chunk of the film's production. It talks about things like the atmosphere of Thor, how they wanted to portray Asgard in terms of scope and design, and all the subtleties they went into for the costuming, make up, coloring, and camera work. In addition, this segment also covers some of the research done on the comic books to translate and adapt said material to look as real as possible, but also infuse the designs with enough imagination for that fantasy element. They then discuss Puente Antiguo (the little New Mexican town) and how it was completely built from scratch, as well as the design parallels to Asgard and how a lot of structures represented some of the more symbolic elements of the story's themes.- Our Fearless Leader (HD; 3:18)Talks about Kenneth Branagh's directing style from various members of the cast.- Assembling the Troupe (HD; 4:44)Discusses the casting of Thor, Jane, and Odin.- Hammer Time (HD; 6:14)Shows the various designs they went through to get the look of Mjolnir (about 200 different sketches), and how they constructed 3 different kinds of hammers for Hemsworth to using during filming.- Creating Laufey (HD; 5:33)The make up work and a little bit of discussion about the king of the Frost Giants.- Music of the Gods (HD; 2:05)A disappointingly short feature about Patrick Doyle's awesome score. I really wish this one were a lot longer.- A Conversation (HD; 2:23)Another short discussion with co-creator Stan Lee, co-producer Craig Kyle, comic book writer J. Michael Straczynski.- Road to the Avengers (HD; 2:57)A mishmash of footage from the other films in the MMU leading up The Avengers. It's nothing more than a tease, as there is no actual Avengers footage to be found.- Deleted Scenes (HD; 24:34)There is optional commentary from director Kenneth Branagh, and I think a few of those clips actually could've worked for the movie overall.- Trailers (HD; 7:25)Teaser, Theatrical, and Avengers Animated.Overall - 4.5Marvel Studios continues to churn out these very well-made pre-Avengers films. Up to this point, Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, and Thor have all managed to be highly entertaining movies and still tell a very good character story to boot (well, minus Hulk, but it's a great action flick). Out of the entire lineup, though, Thor is definitely the most unique with its fantasy element and outer spacey galactic potential if the Studio ever decides to go otherworldly with another franchise (Silver Surfer by Alex Proyas would be a neat idea). Oh, and there's still Captain America to be explored (my favorite of them all, actually), but that will have to wait another month. With reference A/V quality and a decent amount of extras that are only salvaged by that kick-ass- commentary by Branagh, Thor comes highly recommended, especially for fans of the Marvel Movie Universe.",5,Thor (Blu-ray),1316390400,"09 19, 2011",2011,12097,"['Movie', '4.5Much', 'first', 'Iron', 'Man', 'theatrical', 'run', 'had', 'very', 'little', 'knowledge', 'franchise', 'going',

But compared with other action films, ""Thor"" is one of the most romantic of the genre. It's a very subtle romance, because that's how Branagh works. When Thor is exiled to Earth as a mortal, he finds himself dependent upon this feisty little human woman who not only helps him, but stands up to him and tells him to straighten up his act and think about other people for once. Hemsworth does a great job using facial expressions, body stance, and tone of voice to convey Thor's journey from bewilderment at her presumption to being intrigued and beginning to admire her, then wanting to please and help her, and finally, being willing to give up his life to save her. It doesn't hurt that he and Portman have great onscreen chemistry either.Visually this movie is a stunner. The shots of Asgard, both exteriors and interiors, are gorgeous. (As a Terry Pratchett fan, I also loved that they made Asgard a discworld!) Loki is (as others have said) one of the best villains ever, because you can understand his pain and why he does what he does after he finds out the truth of his parentage. Hiddleston makes you believe that he means well and has some ambivalence about the things he does. He and Thor share the same hubris and pay a similar price, but there's no Jane waiting to help Loki get his priorities straight.",4,"Surprisingly good ""chick flick""!",1343779200,"08 1, 2012",2012,1397,"['agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'who', 'think', 'romance', 'subplot', 'needed', 'more', 'time', 'compared', 'other', 'action', 'films', 'Thor', 'one', 'most', 'romantic', 'genre', 'very', 'subtle', 'romance', 'how', 'Branagh', 'When', 'Thor', 'exiled', 'Earth', 'mortal', 'dependent', 'feisty', 'little', 'human', 'woman', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'up', 'straighten', 'up', 'act', 'think', 'other', 'people', 'once', 'Hemsworth', 'great', 'job', 'using', 'facial', 'expressions', 'body', 'stance', 'tone', 'voice', 'convey', 'Thor', 'journey', 'bewilderment', 'presumption', 'being', 'intrigued', 'beginning', 'admire', 'then', 'wanting', 'please', 'help', 'finally', 'being', 'willing', 'give', 'up', 'life', 'save', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'Portman', 'have', 'great', 'onscreen', 'chemistry', 'either.Visually', 'movie', 'stunner', 'shots', 'Asgard', 'exteriors', 'interiors', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'Terry', 'Pratchett', 'fan', 'also', 'loved', 'made', 'Asgard', 'discworld', 'Loki', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'one', 'best', 'villains', 'ever', 'can', 'understand', 'pain', 'why', 'what', 'out', 'truth', 'parentage', 'Hiddleston', 'believe', 'well', 'ambivalence', 'things', 'Thor', 'share', 'same', 'hubris', 'pay', 'similar', 'price', 'Jane', 'waiting', 'help', 'Loki', 'get', 'priorities', 'straight']",N/A
1325259,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B0034G4P80,trebe,"[1, 2]","The epic and complicated mythology connected with Thor, gets a major reworking in Thor (2011), one of the more intricate entries in the ever expanding Marvel movie universe.  A story about Thor inherently involves the duality of the mythological realm of Asgard and the Norse god universe, contrasted against the realm where the mortals of Earth exist.  Extensive special effects are employed to present a vision of this unique fantasy world, however the construct is not always understandable, or the characters particularly convincing.An uneasy peace exists between Asgard, led by their king Odin (Anthony Hopkins,The Silence of the Lambs), and the frost giants of Jotunheim.  After discovering their enemy in their midst, Thor (Chris Hemsworth,The Cabin In The Woods), his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston), and a group of warriors, journey to Jotunheim to do battle with the frost giants, with whom a tenuous peace exists.  After a skirmish, Odin intercedes and his sons escape alive, but with the peace now broken, Asgard may now be in danger.The character's origin gets a complete makeover, as Thor is banished to Earth by his father Odin where he meets astrophysicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman,Black Swan), and her scientific team.  Stripped of his powers, Thor is regarded as a handsome stranger, who speaks of strange things.  This ploy works in large part, due to a winning performance by Hemsworth, who bears some resemblance to a young Brad Pitt.  The real Thor was clean shaven, so Hemsworth's beard may seem out of place to purists, but after being mortal for much of the film, when Thor finally regains his hammer and his powers are restored, it is truly a glorious moment.With Loki plotting to take control, Thor's ultimate challenge lies back in Asgard, where special effects tend to take over.  It's a colorful, overdramatic affair, that concludes with some matters left hanging in the air, although Thor's availability for The Avengers (2012) is made abundantly clear.The godly nature of the character, makes Thor a challenge to capture in a movie, and the special effects are kind of up to par, as the vision isn't always very coherent.  The Dr. Donald Blake from the comics, who tries to keep a low profile, and taps his cane to transform into Thor, is nowhere to be found, as the movie has a completely different tone, and more youthful and modern spin, as Marvel Studios remains focused on the extremely profitable teen audience.  Hemsworth is a physically impressive and engaging Thor, but the story runs a bit long, and drags in several places.  Add in some scenes in Asgard that don't play very well, to some of the good moments on earth, and the overall result is an uneven, semi-entertaining film, that is recommended viewing to Prime members.",3,"the complicated mythology, and reworked characters, muddles the story of Thor...",1348963200,"09 30, 2012",2012,2770,"['epic', 'complicated', 'mythology', 'connected', 'Thor', 'major', 'reworking', 'Thor', '2011', 'one', 'more', 'intricate', 'entries', 'ever', 'expanding', 'Marvel', 'movie', 'universe', 'story', 'Thor', 'inherently', 'duality', 'mythological', 'realm', 'Asgard', 'Norse', 'god', 'universe', 'contrasted', 'realm', 'where', 'mortals', 'Earth', 'exist', 'Extensive', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'employed', 'present', 'vision', 'unique', 'fantasy', 'world', 'however', 'construct', 'not', 'always', 'understandable', 'characters', 'particularly', 'convincing.An', 'uneasy', 'peace', 'Asgard', 'led', 'king', 'Odin', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'frost', 'giants', 'Jotunheim', 'discovering', 'enemy', 'midst', 'Thor', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'Cabin', 'Woods', 'brother', 'Loki', 'Tom', 'Hiddleston', 'group', 'warriors', 'journey', 'Jotunheim', 'do', 'battle', 'frost', 'giants', 'whom', 'tenuous', 'peace', 'exists', 'skirmish', 'Odin', 'intercedes', 'sons', 'escape', 'alive', 'peace', 'now', 'Asgard', 'may', 'now', 'be', 'danger.The', 'character', 'origin', 'complete', 'makeover', 'Thor', 'banished', 'Earth', 'father', 'Odin', 'where', 'astrophysicist', 'Jane', 'Foster', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'Black', 'Swan', 'scientific', 'team', 'Stripped', 'powers', 'Thor', 'regarded', 'handsome', 'stranger', 'who', 'strange', 'things', 'ploy', 'large', 'part', 'due', 'winning', 'performance', 'Hemsworth', 'who', 'resemblance', 'young', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'real', 'Thor', 'was', 'clean', 'shaven', 'Hemsworth', 'beard', 'may', 'seem', 'place', 'purists', 'being', 'mortal', 'much', 'film', 'when', 'Thor', 'finally', 'hammer', 'powers', 'are', 'restored', 'truly', 'glorious', 'moment.With', 'Loki', 'plotting', 'take', 'control', 'Thor', 'ultimate', 'challenge', 'back', 'Asgard', 'where', 'special', 'effects', 'tend', 'take', 'over', 'colorful', 'overdramatic', 'affair', 'matters', 'left', 'hanging', 'air', 'Thor', 'availability', 'Avengers', '2012', 'made', 'abundantly', 'clear.The', 'godly', 'nature', 'character', 'Thor', 'challenge', 'capture', 'movie', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'kind', 'par', 'vision', ""n't"", 'always', 'very', 'coherent', 'Dr.', 'Donald', 'Blake', 'comics', 'who', 'keep', 'low', 'profile', 'taps', 'cane', 'transform', 'Thor', 'nowhere', 'be', 'found', 'movie', 'completely', 'different', 'tone', 'more', 'youthful', 'modern', 'spin', 'Marvel', 'Studios', 'focused', 'extremely', 'profitable', 'teen', 'audience', 'Hemsworth', 'physically', 'impressive', 'engaging', 'Thor', 'story', 'bit', 'long', 'drags', 'several', 'places', 'Add', 'scenes', 'Asgard', 'do', ""n't"", 'play', 'very', 'well', 'good', 'moments', 'earth', 'overall', 'result', 'uneven', 'semi-entertaining', 'film', 'recommended', 'viewing', 'Prime', 'members']",N/A
1325260,A35QA4FIDVBERJ,B0034G4P80,"Trepessa ""Music lover""","[8, 10]","There is no need to rehash what the movie is about since so many have done a great job in retelling the storyline. There are always naysayers who have to pick apart perfectly good movies. I am not a fan of comic books nor have I ever read one of them. I am a fan of mythology and especially Norse so I found the movie very entertaining.  The acting was excellent and believable. Chris Hemsworth made the film. He was perfectly cast in my opinion.  The actor who played Loki was excellent as well.  Each of the actors actually did a great job. Nothing can be taken and adapted and be exactly like the source.  The motion picture is a unique medium in its own right. I felt all the special effects were awesome. I liked the way they flashed back to see why Thor fell to Earth. It was a good touch. I caught the in jokes in the movie and it wasn't from reading comic books.I have probably watched this movie six times now and it is one of the best superhero movies I have ever seen. I have seen many and series with them as well since I am an older woman. I found it a breath of fresh air that the movie was more than a lot of fast action sequences and battles, yet you do get your fill. It made the story more plausible that even though some of the characters were referred to as gods and had super powers,the characters and their actions felt realistic and that they had feelings and emotions beyond ""look at me and kneel to me,"" which was how Thor first acted with his arrogance when he arrived on Earth. In the end, he learned humility and self-sacrifice, which was predictable but would have caused the movie to fall flat without it.  The theme itself is nothing new but there isn't much new to put in films, so that leaves the way it is presented and the actor portraying the part.  They raised him above a mere brute with powers to a god who gains insight into what it means to care about others without expecting anything in return.

While studying anomalous events in the atmosphere under the guidance of her mentor Erik Selwig (Stellan Skarsgard) and with the not-so-able assistance of Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings), she bears witness to Thor's banishment or rather the tornado-like occurrence that made it possible. This intrigues Foster and after a brief period of reticence she hopes to offer help to Thor and, at the same time, elicit any information he might have that could help her in her work. All the while, turmoil in Thor's realm could potentially destroy both it and Earth.I'd not seen Hemsworth before and while the part requires very little beyond physicality, he is adequate at least.

So when Marvel decided to make a movie about Thor I felt that they were getting greedy due to the success of Iron Man. Boy was I pleasantly surprised! Thor is a wonderful movie. Wonderful for many reasons. First it has a sense of humor. This movie is all about fantasy and fun. Thor is the God of Thunder and Chris Hemsworth looks every bit the part. He is dashingly handsome and buff and arrogant yet Hemsworth's talent is such that you never resent him for being arrogant. He's a lovable cocky big lug. The movie starts with Thor on his home planet of Asgard. Thor wants to confront his mortal enemies the Ice Giants, his father Odin, played expertly by the legendary Anthony Hopkins wants diplomacy to prevail. Yet Thor presses the issue and this breach gets him exiled to Earth without his powers only his all powerful hammer Mjolnir which carries the power of an entire planet. Thor on Earth is both hilarious and arrogant at once. Hemsworth is talented enough to pull this off. I laughed when a nurse draws blood from Thor and Thor bellows: ""How dare you attack the Son of Odin!"" It is that kind of humor that makes this movie so good it's a perfect blend of humor, action and great acting. Hemsworth is a stunning revelation hopefully he will get great roles in the future to make him a huge star because he's a great looking guy with a great body and all the acting talent to back up his looks. Natalie Portman plays the love interest but this love affair is not the overwhelming forced sexfest of most action movies. Instead this love affair is sweet and romantic. It reminds me of the love affair between Lois Lane and Superman in the original Superman movie from 1977. Watching Portman's character and Thor kiss at the end of the movie actually means something. A lot more than all the gritty sex scenes in most action films.

By all rights it shouldn't work but ""Thor"" manages to be an entertaining, action packed thrill ride that juggles quite a few subplots VERY effectively. It shouldn't be a surprise though given that Branagh has done this juggling act before but with ""Henry V"" (which along with ""King Lear"" and the Arthur myth provided inspiration for the story as seen by the director)and other densely ploted plays by the Bard.Benefiting from a clever well written screenplay written by Ashley Miller, Zack Stenz and Don Payne(and based on a story by TV/film and comic book writer J. Michael Straczynski & Mark Protosevich which was, of couse, based on the comic book originally done by Jack Kirby, Stan Lee and Larry Leiber (Stan Lee's brother), ""Thor"" works so well because of the unifying vision of Branagh who sees the film as a comic book version of classic, action packed plays and literature. Chris Hemsdale (""Star Trek"")makes the main character appealing despite his vanity and ego as portrayed early on in the film while Tom Hiddleston does a fine job playing Thor's brother and main rival for the throne Loki.Spoilers:Banished to Earth because of his arrogance, ego and for almost breaking the peace with the Frost Giants by his father King Odin (Anthony Hopkins), Thor finds adjusting to being a human a difficult experience. Scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) is fascinated with Thor and believes he holds the answers to a weird scientific event that occurred in the New Mexico desert when he first appeared. He finds himself thrust into the role of Earth's protector when Loki unleases the Destroyed on Earth to kill Thor and when Loki betrays his people to help Odin's nemesis the Frost Giants come to power.Spoilers End:Fans of ""The Avengers"" comics should also watch for a cameo by Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton aka Hawkeye and, of course, Samuel L. Jackson in a cameo at the conclusion of the film.Updated for Blu-ray: The Blu-ray has a number of cool special features but I most enjoyed the cut/extended scenes and the director's commentary which was quite insightful.Image quality was amazing truly a demo quality Blu-ray.Recommended.",4,"The God of Thunder kicks butt in ""marvel ous"" film of classic comic",1304726400,"05 7, 2011",2011,2247,"['Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'film', 'version', 'Thor', 'awful', 'lot', 'story', 'hour', 'forty-five', 'minutes', 'rights', 'should', ""n't"", 'work', 'Thor', 'be', 'entertaining', 'action', 'packed', 'thrill', 'ride', 'quite', 'few', 'subplots', 'VERY', 'effectively', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprise', 'given', 'Branagh', 'done', 'juggling', 'act', 'Henry', 'V', 'along', 'King', 'Lear', 'Arthur', 'myth', 'provided', 'inspiration', 'story', 'seen', 'director', 'other', 'densely', 'ploted', 'plays', 'Bard.Benefiting', 'clever', 'well', 'written', 'screenplay', 'written', 'Ashley', 'Miller', 'Zack', 'Stenz', 'Don', 'Payne', 'based', 'story', 'TV/film', 'comic', 'book', 'writer', 'J.', 'Michael', 'Straczynski', 'Mark', 'Protosevich', 'was', 'couse', 'based', 'comic', 'book', 'originally', 'done', 'Jack', 'Kirby', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'Larry', 'Leiber', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'brother', 'Thor', 'works', 'so', 'well', 'unifying', 'vision', 'Branagh', 'who', 'film', 'comic', 'book', 'version', 'classic', 'action', 'packed', 'plays', 'literature', 'Chris', 'Hemsdale', 'Star', 'Trek', 'main', 'character', 'appealing', 'vanity', 'ego', 'portrayed', 'early', 'film', 'Tom', 'Hiddleston', 'fine', 'job', 'playing', 'Thor', 'brother', 'main', 'rival', 'throne', 'Loki.Spoilers', 'Banished', 'Earth', 'arrogance', 'ego', 'almost', 'breaking', 'peace', 'Frost', 'Giants', 'father', 'King', 'Odin', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Thor', 'adjusting', 'being', 'human', 'difficult', 'experience', 'Scientist', 'Jane', 'Foster', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'fascinated', 'Thor', 'answers', 'weird', 'scientific', 'event', 'occurred', 'New', 'Mexico', 'desert', 'when', 'first', 'appeared', 'thrust', 'role', 'Earth', 'protector', 'when', 'Loki', 'Destroyed', 'Earth', 'kill', 'Thor', 'when', 'Loki', 'people', 'help', 'Odin', 'nemesis', 'Frost', 'Giants', 'come', 'power.Spoilers', 'End', 'Fans', 'Avengers', 'comics', 'should', 'also', 'watch', 'cameo', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'Clint', 'Barton', 'Hawkeye', 'course', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'cameo', 'conclusion', 'film.Updated', 'Blu-ray', 'Blu-ray', 'number', 'cool', 'special', 'features', 'most', 'enjoyed', 'cut/extended', 'scenes', 'director', 'commentary', 'was', 'quite', 'insightful.Image', 'quality', 'was', 'amazing', 'truly', 'demo', 'quality', 'Blu-ray.Recommended']",N/A

1325291,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B0034G4P80,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[12, 18]","On the plus side, Kenneth Branagh's Thor fulfills its intended purpose: to introduce the comic book character Thor to audiences prior to the release of the upcoming Avengers movie. The movie draws on the original Marvel comic book's background for Thor's origin as the Norse god banished to Earth by his father, Odin. While it preserves most of the relevant Asgardian characters (Thor's scheming brother Loki; his comrades Fandral, Hogun and Volstagg; the warrioress Sif, the guardian of the Rainbow Bridge, Heimdall; and others), there are some variations to the original storyline that fans of the comic will notice. That said however, the differences really won't matter to anyone not familiar with the comic and so aren't worth going into here.Note: for those who are not familiar with the classic Marvel superhero team, the Avengers (in the upcoming film version anyway) consist of Iron Man (already introduced in the two Iron Man films of 2008 and 2010), the Incredible Hulk (introduced in the 2008 film of that name), Thor (introduced in this film) and Captain America (to be introduced in a film coming out later this year). Two other Avengers, the Black Widow and Hawkeye, while not being given their own films, have been introduced in the others, the Black Widow in a cameo in the second Iron Man film and Hawkeye in a cameo here in Thor.I can't say that Thor is a great film. It's watchable and fulfills its mission, but I think less would have been more. The back-and-forth plot that keeps switching between Earth and Asgard makes it hard for the film to really build up any momentum. The beginning is, quite frankly rather slow as it fills in a lot of background, and the film doesn't really seem to hit its stride until almost an hour in. This is definitely a case where less would have been more. A slimmer, more focused film would've allowed for more character development and more heart.The casting is something of a mixed bag, though to be fair to the actors the script's frequently banal dialogue doesn't really allow for much character development. The good news is that Chris Hemsworth fills the bill as Thor, and looks awesome when he's in full armor (though they thankfully ditched the stupid helmet from the comic). Anthony Hopkins is a decent Odin, and Tom Hiddleson actually manages to imbue Loki with some surprising depth.  The two most pleasant surprises were Idris Elba as Heimdall and Josh Dallas as Fandral. More than any other actors in the film, Elba and Dallas seemed to really _get_ the whole heroic comic-book feel that the film called for, Elba in his solemn, duty-bound but conflicted guardian Heimdall, and Dallas in his dashing, reveling-in-the-fight Fandral who really lights up the screen when he's on.On the down side, Natalie Portman was wasted, mainly again due to the script, which limits her to a brilliant-female-scientist-who-falls-in-love-with-muscular-hunk-because-the-plot-demands-it role. Ray Stevenson, whom I've loved in other rolls and who can be heroic and wickedly funny at the same time, was also wasted.  He's well cast as Volstagg, who is _supposed_ to be funny, but the script never lets him actually _be_ funny. And Tadanobu Asano as Hogun is just _wrong_; Asgardian warriors should _not_ have Japanese accents.There are a few cameos to watch for.  Stan Lee, the writer who essentially created the Thor character for Marvel comics back in the 60's, is in there.  J. Michael Straczynski who wrote the story for the movie (not the script - can't blame that on him) is in there. And a recent two-time Oscar-nominee whom I won't name but who you'll immediately recognize, gives you a hint of what he's going to be like as Hawkeye in the upcoming Avengers film.As for the 3D, Thor is a classic case of why retrofitting a film into 3D is usually a bad idea. It makes a film darker, literally, and this effect really shows up in Thor. Some sections are so dark they'll have you instinctively squinting. And quite honestly, I can't recall a single scene where the 3D was even really noticeable, let alone noteworthy. You won't be missing a thing seeing this one as a normal film.Recommended for anyone with an interest in Marvel comic superheroes and particularly for anyone planning on seeing the upcoming Avengers film.",3,"Watchable, but less would have been more",1306627200,"05 29, 2011",2011,4277,"['plus', 'side', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'Thor', 'intended', 'purpose', 'introduce', 'comic', 'book', 'character', 'Thor', 'audiences', 'prior', 'release', 'upcoming', 'Avengers', 'movie', 'movie', 'draws', 'original', 'Marvel', 'comic', 'book', 'background', 'Thor', 'origin', 'Norse', 'god', 'banished', 'Earth', 'father', 'Odin', 'most', 'relevant', 'Asgardian', 'characters', 'Thor', 'scheming', 'brother', 'Loki', 'comrades', 'Fandral', 'Hogun', 'Volstagg', 'warrioress', 'Sif', 'guardian', 'Rainbow', 'Bridge', 'Heimdall', 'others', 'are', 'variations', 'original', 'storyline', 'fans', 'comic', 'will', 'notice', 'said', 'however', 'differences', 'really', 'wo', ""n't"", 'matter', 'anyone', 'not', 'familiar', 'comic', 'so', 'are', ""n't"", 'worth', 'going', 'here.Note', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'familiar', 'classic', 'Marvel', 'superhero', 'team', 'Avengers', 'upcoming', 'film', 'version', 'anyway', 'consist', 'Iron', 'Man', 'already', 'introduced', 'two', 'Iron', 'Man', 'films', '2008', '2010', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'introduced', '2008', 'film', 'name', 'Thor', 'introduced', 'film', 'Captain', 'America', 'be', 'introduced', 'film', 'coming', 'out', 'later', 'year', 'Two', 'other', 'Avengers', 'Black', 'Widow', 'Hawkeye', 'not', 'being', 'given', 'own', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'introduced', 'others', 'Black', 'Widow', 'cameo', 'second', 'Iron', 'Man', 'film', 'Hawkeye', 'cameo', 'here', 'Thor.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'Thor', 'great', 'film', 'watchable', 'mission', 'think', 'less', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'back-and-forth', 'plot', 'switching', 'Earth', 'Asgard', 'hard', 'film', 'really', 'build', 'up', 'momentum', 'beginning', 'quite', 'frankly', 'rather', 'slow', 'lot', 'background', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'hit', 'stride', 'almost', 'hour', 'definitely', 'case', 'where', 'less', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'slimmer', 'more', 'focused', 'film', 'would', ""'ve"", 'allowed', 'more', 'character', 'development', 'more', 'heart.The', 'casting', 'something', 'mixed', 'bag', 'be', 'fair', 'actors', 'script', 'frequently', 'banal', 'dialogue', ""n't"", 'really', 'allow', 'much', 'character', 'development', 'good', 'news', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'bill', 'Thor', 'awesome', 'when', 'full', 'armor', 'thankfully', 'ditched', 'stupid', 'helmet', 'comic', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'decent', 'Odin', 'Tom', 'Hiddleson', 'actually', 'imbue', 'Loki', 'surprising', 'depth', 'two', 'most', 'pleasant', 'surprises', 'were', 'Idris', 'Elba', 'Heimdall', 'Josh', 'Dallas', 'Fandral', 'More', 'other', 'actors', 'film', 'Elba', 'Dallas', 'seemed', 'really', '_get_', 'whole', 'heroic', 'comic-book', 'feel', 'film', 'called', 'Elba', 'solemn', 'duty-bound', 'conflicted', 'guardian', 'Heimdall', 'Dallas', 'dashing', 'reveling-in-the-fight', 'Fandral', 'who', 'really', 'up', 'screen', 'when', 'down', 'side', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'was', 'wasted', 'mainly', 'again', 'due', 'script', 'brilliant-female-scientist-who-falls-in-love-with-muscular-hunk-because-the-plot-demands-it', 'role', 'Ray', 'Stevenson', 'whom', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'other', 'rolls', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'heroic', 'wickedly', 'funny', 'same', 'time', 'was', 'also', 'wasted', 'well', 'cast', 'Volstagg', 'who', '_supposed_', 'be', 'funny', 'script', 'never', 'actually', '_be_', 'funny', 'Tadanobu', 'Asano', 'Hogun', 'just', '_wrong_', 'Asgardian', 'warriors', 'should', '_not_', 'have', 'Japanese', 'accents.There', 'are', 'few', 'cameos', 'watch', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'writer', 'who', 'essentially', 'created', 'Thor', 'character', 'Marvel', 'comics', 'back', '60', 'there', 'J.', 'Michael', 'Straczynski', 'who', 'wrote', 'story', 'movie', 'not', 'script', 'ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'there', 'recent', 'two-time', 'Oscar-nominee', 'whom', 'wo', ""n't"", 'name', 'who', ""'ll"", 'immediately', 'recognize', 'hint', 'what', 'going', 'be', 'Hawkeye', 'upcoming', 'Avengers', 'film.As', '3D', 'Thor', 'classic', 'case', 'why', 'retrofitting', 'film', '3D', 'usually', 'bad', 'idea', 'film', 'darker', 'literally', 'effect', 'really', 'up', 'Thor', 'sections', 'are', 'so', 'dark', ""'ll"", 'have', 'instinctively', 'squinting', 'quite', 'honestly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'single', 'scene', 'where', '3D', 'was', 'even', 'really', 'noticeable', 'let', 'alone', 'noteworthy', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'missing', 'thing', 'seeing', 'one', 'normal', 'film.Recommended', 'anyone', 'interest', 'Marvel', 'comic', 'superheroes', 'particularly', 'anyone', 'planning', 'seeing', 'upcoming', 'Avengers', 'film']",N/A
1325292,A3M17XG8HL7JRF,B0034G4P80,"Who Am I? ""Me!""","[1, 1]","I usually don't really like superhero movies as they are often rife with bad acting, unworthy scripts, and 2 dimensional characters; Special effects are often used as a way to hide the fact that there is not much of a story.  Having said that- Thor fairs fairly well as far as this genre goes.  Primarily due to the character Loki and the brilliant actor who portrays him.Whether you are someone who lived under the shadow of a sibling or someone who felt lied to & betrayed by family.. whether you're someone who felt they weren't ever given a fair chance growing up or someone who was raised by a cold and restrictive parent.. or whether you were just someone who has felt like an outsider for much of their lives, chances are you're going to feel some sort of affinity toward Loki.  And lets face it.  This is going to mean a huge part of the population.  Is there any wonder people gravitate toward this character unlike any other?  Out of all the superhumans in the marvel universe thus far, Loki is by far the most human.Thor is an oaf who's idea of fun is literally pounding his way through things.  At the beginning especially, he is completely ruled by his ego and emotions. This changes somewhat through the course of the movie.  Though not necessarily stupid, Thor is not really intelligent either.  His idea of war includes no forethought and no strategy.  What Thor does have aside from his massive structure is a lot of heart and conviction so he's overall a decent human being with a strong sense of self.  Conversely Loki is a guy who thinks before he acts.  Though he has a mischevious side, he is very intelligent (and at least at first) is able to put aside his ego and emotions for the greater good-  that is until he finds out his entire life is a lie and he basically snaps.  At the risk of sounding like someone who is excusing Loki's very serious misdeeds- one might even go as far as to say that Loki's ""turn"" is merely an exercise in reaching out for another identity after he so abruptly lost his.The movie is not perfect by far.  In fact, if it weren't for Loki it would've been a bit of a throw-a-way like most other movies of this genre.  Chris Hemsworth makes a great Thor, but the script fails him sometimes.  The romance between Thor and Jane is difficult to swallow.  The idea that a brilliant physicist falls head over heels for a witless oaf like Thor (as he can be described in the beginning of the movie)  just because he fills out his shirt well is a hard sell and unfortunately, this film doesn't even bother to try to sell it.  Thor's interest in Jane is also a bit of a mystery as they have nothing in common. We're simply asked to accept this romance without ever being given any reason to care whether or not they come together - or stay together for that matter.  Some scenes were choppy.  Though not a perfect movie, it is by far the best superhero movie I've personally seen to date.",4,"Even if you're not into this genre you'll still find reasons to like ""Thor""",1384041600,"11 10, 2013",2013,2930,"['usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'like', 'superhero', 'movies', 'are', 'often', 'rife', 'bad', 'acting', 'unworthy', 'scripts', '2', 'dimensional', 'characters', 'Special', 'effects', 'are', 'often', 'used', 'way', 'hide', 'fact', 'not', 'much', 'story', 'Having', 'said', 'that-', 'Thor', 'fairs', 'fairly', 'well', 'as', 'far', 'genre', 'Primarily', 'due', 'character', 'Loki', 'brilliant', 'actor', 'who', 'him.Whether', 'are', 'someone', 'who', 'lived', 'shadow', 'sibling', 'someone', 'who', 'felt', 'lied', 'betrayed', 'family..', ""'re"", 'someone', 'who', 'felt', 'were', ""n't"", 'ever', 'given', 'fair', 'chance', 'growing', 'up', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'raised', 'cold', 'restrictive', 'parent..', 'were', 'just', 'someone', 'who', 'felt', 'outsider', 'much', 'lives', 'chances', 'are', ""'re"", 'going', 'feel', 'sort', 'affinity', 'Loki', 'face', 'going', 'mean', 'huge', 'part', 'population', 'there', 'wonder', 'people', 'gravitate', 'character', 'other', 'superhumans', 'marvel', 'universe', 'thus', 'far', 'Loki', 'far', 'most', 'human.Thor', 'oaf', 'who', 'idea', 'fun', 'literally', 'pounding', 'way', 'things', 'beginning', 'especially', 'completely', 'ruled', 'ego', 'emotions', 'somewhat', 'course', 'movie', 'not', 'necessarily', 'stupid', 'Thor', 'not', 'really', 'intelligent', 'either', 'idea', 'war', 'forethought', 'strategy', 'What', 'Thor', 'have', 'aside', 'massive', 'structure', 'lot', 'heart', 'conviction', 'overall', 'decent', 'human', 'being', 'strong', 'sense', 'self', 'Conversely', 'Loki', 'guy', 'who', 'mischevious', 'side', 'very', 'intelligent', 'least', 'first', 'able', 'put', 'aside', 'ego', 'emotions', 'greater', 'good-', 'out', 'entire', 'life', 'lie', 'basically', 'risk', 'sounding', 'someone', 'who', 'excusing', 'Loki', 'very', 'serious', 'misdeeds-', 'one', 'might', 'even', 'go', 'as', 'far', 'say', 'Loki', 'turn', 'merely', 'exercise', 'reaching', 'out', 'identity', 'so', 'abruptly', 'lost', 'his.The', 'movie', 'not', 'perfect', 'far', 'fact', 'were', ""n't"", 'Loki', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'bit', 'throw-a-way', 'most', 'other', 'movies', 'genre', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'great', 'Thor', 'script', 'sometimes', 'romance', 'Thor', 'Jane', 'difficult', 'swallow', 'idea', 'brilliant', 'physicist', 'falls', 'head', 'heels', 'witless', 'oaf', 'Thor', 'can', 'be', 'described', 'beginning', 'movie', 'just', 'out', 'shirt', 'well', 'hard', 'sell', 'unfortunately', 'film', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'try', 'sell', 'Thor', 'interest', 'Jane', 'also', 'bit', 'mystery', 'have', 'nothing', 'common', ""'re"", 'simply', 'asked', 'accept', 'romance', 'ever', 'being', 'given', 'reason', 'care', 'not', 'come', 'together', 'stay', 'together', 'matter', 'scenes', 'were', 'choppy', 'not', 'perfect', 'movie', 'far', 'best', 'superhero', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'personally', 'seen', 'date']",N/A

I was very pleasantly surprised in a lot of ways.  When it comes to this Blu-Ray/DVD combo + Digital Copy, it has to be said that the quality of an HD viewing really is your best bet.  There are a lot of visual effects including entire digitally-created sets that are highly detailed, fantastic, and gorgeous in high definition.The movie itself has moments of pure fantasy that remind me of a Final Fantasy game, with scenes of action worthy of any good superhero film, plus large-scale battle sequences reminiscent of the Lord of the Rings films.  We have a storyline similar to the '80s movie (and TV show) Starman, and the acting is top-notch.  (Sir!) Anthony Hopkins does an excellent job of portraying a father torn by the pain of seeing his sons in turmoil, unable to learn the lessons that will bring them into adulthood.  Chris Hemsworth captures the angry-young-man impulsiveness and yet still shows such compassion and chivalry that any fan of romance will truly enjoy the love story--and he is definitely as physically fit as a god.  The only real drawback to the acting is that Natalie Portman has to struggle to be relevant in the midst of so many different story elements (though I do believe she is a great actress).  It's especially entertaining to see Tom Hiddleston  (as Loki) mischeviously steal nearly every scene he's in.While I'm not steeped in Thor's mythos, I have to give credit to the story's writers for taking the Arthur C. Clarke approach to depicting the world of Asgard:  they simply appear to be so very technologically advanced from our society that their technology is indistinguishable from magic.  Part of the fun in this particular movie is its connection to the other Marvel films:  with Iron Man 1 & 2, the Hulk films and Captain America, 'Thor' sets the stage for The Avengers:  it has pieces of the storyline from the other movies dropped into the main story in a very interesting way.If you've seen one or more of the Marvel superhero films that tie into The Avengers, see 'em all.  I don't buy many movies these days, but Thor is definitely a Blu-Ray worth owning.  It is not my favorite film in the series, but it is definitely far better than I expected it to be.",5,Better than Expected,1374105600,"07 18, 2013",2013,2383,"['When', 'finally', 'got', 'chance', 'watch', 'Marvel', 'movies', 'together', 'ones', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'lately', 'expected', 'Thor', 'be', 'weakest', 'entries', 'series', 'was', 'very', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'lot', 'ways', 'When', 'Blu-Ray/DVD', 'combo', '+', 'Digital', 'Copy', 'be', 'said', 'quality', 'HD', 'viewing', 'really', 'best', 'bet', 'are', 'lot', 'visual', 'effects', 'including', 'entire', 'digitally-created', 'sets', 'are', 'highly', 'detailed', 'fantastic', 'gorgeous', 'high', 'definition.The', 'movie', 'moments', 'pure', 'fantasy', 'remind', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'game', 'scenes', 'action', 'worthy', 'good', 'superhero', 'film', 'large-scale', 'battle', 'sequences', 'reminiscent', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'films', 'have', 'storyline', 'similar', ""'80s"", 'movie', 'TV', 'show', 'Starman', 'acting', 'top-notch', 'Sir', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'father', 'torn', 'pain', 'seeing', 'sons', 'turmoil', 'unable', 'learn', 'lessons', 'will', 'bring', 'adulthood', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'angry-young-man', 'impulsiveness', 'yet', 'still', 'such', 'compassion', 'chivalry', 'fan', 'romance', 'will', 'truly', 'enjoy', 'love', 'story', 'definitely', 'physically', 'fit', 'god', 'only', 'real', 'drawback', 'acting', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'struggle', 'be', 'relevant', 'midst', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'story', 'elements', 'do', 'believe', 'great', 'actress', 'especially', 'entertaining', 'see', 'Tom', 'Hiddleston', 'Loki', 'mischeviously', 'steal', 'nearly', 'scene', 'in.While', ""'m"", 'not', 'steeped', 'Thor', 'mythos', 'have', 'give', 'credit', 'story', 'writers', 'taking', 'Arthur', 'C.', 'Clarke', 'approach', 'depicting', 'world', 'Asgard', 'simply', 'appear', 'be', 'so', 'very', 'technologically', 'advanced', 'society', 'technology', 'indistinguishable', 'magic', 'Part', 'fun', 'particular', 'movie', 'connection', 'other', 'Marvel', 'films', 'Iron', 'Man', '1', '2', 'Hulk', 'films', 'Captain', 'America', ""'Thor"", 'stage', 'Avengers', 'pieces', 'storyline', 'other', 'movies', 'dropped', 'main', 'story', 'very', 'interesting', 'way.If', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'one', 'more', 'Marvel', 'superhero', 'films', 'tie', 'Avengers', 'see', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'many', 'movies', 'days', 'Thor', 'definitely', 'Blu-Ray', 'worth', 'owning', 'not', 'favorite', 'film', 'series', 'definitely', 'far', 'better', 'expected', 'be']",N/A

1325304,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B0034G4P80,Wuchak,"[5, 6]","2011's ""Thor"" is based on the long-running Marvel comic book. The comic was unique in that the stories regularly involved three realms -- the mythical Asgard and neighboring areas, which was where Thor and his fellow Asgardians called home, uncharted expanses across the universe, and Earth. I rarely if ever appreciated the Asgardian segments, but I often enjoyed the many creative cosmic explorations and the Earth-centered stories.The film is amazing in that it successfully recreates Asgard and its main characters for the screen, not to mention that it actually makes them interesting (I never found Odin, Sif or the Warrior's Three interesting).THE PLOT: Odin the ""Allfather"" is about to anoint Thor as the next king of Asgard, but his son displays folly, arrogance, disrespect and rebellion, forcing Odin to discipline him. Thor is stripped of his godhood and his incredible hammer, Mjolnir, and banished to the earth with no more power than any mortal his size. Thor encounters Jane Porter & her colleagues, as well as the US Government, in his quest for Mjolnir and redemption. Meanwhile his jealous brother Loki enacts schemes in Asgard, forcing the Warrior's Three and Sif to leave and find the exiled Thor. Loki sends The Destroyer to eliminate his brother, which also threatens the thunder god's new group of mortal friends.You couldn't ask for a better cast: Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Anthony Hopkins as Odin, Tom Hiddleston as Loki and three total babes as Jane Porter, Jane's friend Darcy and Lady Sif -- Natalie Portman, Kat Dennings and Jaimie Alexander respectively. Some complain about the Asian and African actors in the roles of Hogun and Heimdall, but Hogun always seemed to be modeled after Mongol-types anyway. And who says there aren't other races on Asgard anyway? The Norse encountered some Asgardians many centuries ago spurring their mythology, which naturally didn't include (then) far-off races, but who says the real Asgardians weren't racially diverse?Some criticize the film as campy because it deals with Norse mythology and the fact that the whole realm of Asgard can seem outlandish and cartooney. Yet the movie isn't about their mythology but about the actual Asgardians, who are very real in this story.""Thor"" works so well because it's more than just a bunch mindless superhero mumbo jumbo and exciting action/CGI. The deep themes include the pitfalls of arrogance, juvenile rebellion, jealousy, rivalry and deceit, as well as the universal nobility of humility, repentance, courage and sacrificial love. On top of all this, we get a complex and interesting villain for a change. Sure it has a comic booky vibe, but that's what ""Thor"" is based on. To dismiss it as ""another campy Marvel film"" is grossly inaccurate.The film runs 115 minutes and the Earth episodes were shot in New Mexico.The DVD features 4 deleted scenes, a ""Road to the Avengers"" featurette, a director's commentary and a few trailers.FINAL WORD: I don't think you could ask for a better film adaption of the Thor comic and the thunder god's adventures in Asgard, Earth and elsewhere.GRADE: A",5,More than just a superhero flick,1317168000,"09 28, 2011",2011,3100,"['2011', 'Thor', 'based', 'long-running', 'Marvel', 'comic', 'book', 'comic', 'was', 'unique', 'stories', 'regularly', 'involved', 'three', 'realms', 'mythical', 'Asgard', 'neighboring', 'areas', 'was', 'where', 'Thor', 'fellow', 'Asgardians', 'called', 'home', 'uncharted', 'expanses', 'universe', 'Earth', 'rarely', 'ever', 'appreciated', 'Asgardian', 'segments', 'often', 'enjoyed', 'many', 'creative', 'cosmic', 'explorations', 'Earth-centered', 'stories.The', 'film', 'amazing', 'successfully', 'Asgard', 'main', 'characters', 'screen', 'not', 'mention', 'actually', 'interesting', 'never', 'found', 'Odin', 'Sif', 'Warrior', 'Three', 'interesting', 'PLOT', 'Odin', 'Allfather', 'anoint', 'Thor', 'next', 'king', 'Asgard', 'son', 'displays', 'folly', 'arrogance', 'disrespect', 'rebellion', 'forcing', 'Odin', 'discipline', 'Thor', 'stripped', 'godhood', 'incredible', 'hammer', 'Mjolnir', 'banished', 'earth', 'more', 'power', 'mortal', 'size', 'Thor', 'Jane', 'Porter', 'colleagues', 'as', 'well', 'US', 'Government', 'quest', 'Mjolnir', 'redemption', 'Meanwhile', 'jealous', 'brother', 'Loki', 'schemes', 'Asgard', 'forcing', 'Warrior', 'Three', 'Sif', 'leave', 'find', 'exiled', 'Thor', 'Loki', 'Destroyer', 'eliminate', 'brother', 'also', 'thunder', 'god', 'new', 'group', 'mortal', 'friends.You', 'could', ""n't"", 'ask', 'better', 'cast', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'Thor', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Odin', 'Tom', 'Hiddleston', 'Loki', 'three', 'total', 'babes', 'Jane', 'Porter', 'Jane', 'friend', 'Darcy', 'Lady', 'Sif', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'Kat', 'Dennings', 'Jaimie', 'Alexander', 'respectively', 'complain', 'Asian', 'African', 'actors', 'roles', 'Hogun', 'Heimdall', 'Hogun', 'always', 'seemed', 'be', 'modeled', 'Mongol-types', 'anyway', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'other', 'races', 'Asgard', 'anyway', 'Norse', 'encountered', 'Asgardians', 'many', 'centuries', 'spurring', 'mythology', 'naturally', 'did', ""n't"", 'include', 'then', 'far-off', 'races', 'who', 'real', 'Asgardians', 'were', ""n't"", 'racially', 'diverse', 'criticize', 'film', 'campy', 'Norse', 'mythology', 'fact', 'whole', 'realm', 'Asgard', 'can', 'seem', 'outlandish', 'cartooney', 'movie', ""n't"", 'mythology', 'actual', 'Asgardians', 'who', 'are', 'very', 'real', 'story', 'Thor', 'so', 'well', 'more', 'just', 'bunch', 'mindless', 'superhero', 'mumbo', 'jumbo', 'exciting', 'action/CGI', 'deep', 'themes', 'include', 'pitfalls', 'arrogance', 'juvenile', 'rebellion', 'jealousy', 'rivalry', 'deceit', 'as', 'well', 'universal', 'nobility', 'humility', 'repentance', 'courage', 'sacrificial', 'love', 'top', 'get', 'complex', 'interesting', 'villain', 'change', 'Sure', 'comic', 'booky', 'vibe', 'what', 'Thor', 'based', 'dismiss', 'campy', 'Marvel', 'film', 'grossly', 'inaccurate.The', 'film', '115', 'minutes', 'Earth', 'episodes', 'were', 'shot', 'New', 'Mexico.The', 'DVD', '4', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Road', 'Avengers', 'featurette', 'director', 'commentary', 'few', 'trailers.FINAL', 'WORD', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'could', 'ask', 'better', 'film', 'adaption', 'Thor', 'comic', 'thunder', 'god', 'adventures', 'Asgard', 'Earth', 'elsewhere.GRADE']",N/A
