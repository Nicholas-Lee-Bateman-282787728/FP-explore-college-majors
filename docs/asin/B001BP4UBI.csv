So not only did our local radio stations reflect this culture, but progressive bands found more receptive venues. When Jimi Hendrix came to Charlotte, it was as a warm-up band for the Monkees. So I never got to see my favorite band until the Age of DVD. ""Live In Japan"" not only brings my first video of King Crimson, but the ""THRAK"" band itself looking pretty impressive. For the most part the video is excellent and the soundtrack is blasting away. If you like ""THRAK"" in any of its audio manifestations you have to see this Japanese  version. I swear, it's got the most powerful ""Red"" I think I've heard! And all the cuts are almost  perfect.[Ed. note: I believe, from the dates and location, that this concert part is ""Deja Vroom"" without the navigation difficulties.]",5,KC Live In Japan!,1232928000,"01 26, 2009",2009,853,"['grew', 'up', 'conservative', 'community', 'where', 'country', 'beach', 'musc', 'was', 'norm', 'So', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'local', 'radio', 'stations', 'reflect', 'culture', 'progressive', 'bands', 'found', 'more', 'receptive', 'venues', 'When', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'came', 'Charlotte', 'was', 'warm-up', 'band', 'Monkees', 'So', 'never', 'got', 'see', 'favorite', 'band', 'Age', 'DVD', 'Live', 'Japan', 'not', 'only', 'brings', 'first', 'video', 'King', 'Crimson', 'THRAK', 'band', 'looking', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'most', 'part', 'video', 'excellent', 'soundtrack', 'blasting', 'away', 'like', 'THRAK', 'audio', 'manifestations', 'have', 'see', 'Japanese', 'version', 'swear', 'got', 'most', 'powerful', 'Red', 'think', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'cuts', 'are', 'almost', 'perfect.', '[', 'Ed', 'note', 'believe', 'dates', 'location', 'concert', 'part', 'Deja', 'Vroom', 'navigation', 'difficulties', ']']",N/A

I was a sort of skinney weird teenager who's taste in music was a little on the strange side.  I tried to introduce them to my friends and they all thought it was so called hippie or white music.  A few  years later, after Last days and time, head to the sky, open our eyes and thats' the way of the world, now they were the band to listen to in your car or dome or at every shcool dance.  Everyone loved them, white black, their music crossed all lines and race barriers.  Maurice White and his brothers, alone with Larry Dunn, Andrew Woolfolk(RIP), Johnny Gramhn, Phillip Bailey, Ralph Johnson, Freddie and Verdine White, were on top of the world, concerts sold out and I used to travel wherever they were playing on the east coast from New York, Philly, South Carolina, and Florida.  I loved them.  I Put in my high school year book, on the senior page, that one of my greatest desires was to Marry Maurice White of Earth Wind and Fire.  My friends all laughed, said he was an old man and probadly be too old to marry a young teen like me.  I didn't care, his songs told me that he was feeling all my thoughts and reading my heart.  They got me through the seventies and almost through the eighties.  When I am down, I can put my old original records on my ( I have the CDs also) Phono and listen to Maurice tell me what to do when I am feeling blue, keep my head to sky, Clover and Power.  Works for me!  No band before them and none after them can macth the wisdom, the energy  nor the Genius of one of the greatest bands ever. Always in my most humble opinon!",5,My most favorite band ever.,1359676800,"02 1, 2013",2013,1632,"['loved', 'Earth', 'Wind', 'Fire', 'when', 'one', 'really', 'knew', 'who', 'were', 'was', 'sort', 'skinney', 'weird', 'teenager', 'who', 'taste', 'music', 'was', 'little', 'strange', 'side', 'tried', 'introduce', 'friends', 'thought', 'was', 'so', 'called', 'hippie', 'white', 'music', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'Last', 'days', 'time', 'head', 'sky', 'open', 'eyes', 'thats', 'way', 'world', 'now', 'were', 'band', 'listen', 'car', 'dome', 'shcool', 'dance', 'Everyone', 'loved', 'white', 'black', 'music', 'crossed', 'lines', 'race', 'barriers', 'Maurice', 'White', 'brothers', 'alone', 'Larry', 'Dunn', 'Andrew', 'Woolfolk', 'RIP', 'Johnny', 'Gramhn', 'Phillip', 'Bailey', 'Ralph', 'Johnson', 'Freddie', 'Verdine', 'White', 'were', 'top', 'world', 'concerts', 'sold', 'out', 'used', 'travel', 'were', 'playing', 'east', 'coast', 'New', 'York', 'Philly', 'South', 'Carolina', 'Florida', 'loved', 'Put', 'high', 'school', 'year', 'book', 'senior', 'page', 'one', 'greatest', 'desires', 'was', 'Marry', 'Maurice', 'White', 'Earth', 'Wind', 'Fire', 'friends', 'laughed', 'said', 'was', 'old', 'man', 'probadly', 'be', 'too', 'old', 'marry', 'young', 'teen', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'songs', 'told', 'was', 'feeling', 'thoughts', 'reading', 'heart', 'got', 'seventies', 'almost', 'eighties', 'When', 'am', 'down', 'can', 'put', 'old', 'original', 'records', 'have', 'CDs', 'also', 'Phono', 'listen', 'Maurice', 'tell', 'what', 'do', 'when', 'am', 'feeling', 'blue', 'keep', 'head', 'sky', 'Clover', 'Power', 'band', 'none', 'can', 'macth', 'wisdom', 'energy', 'Genius', 'one', 'greatest', 'bands', 'ever', 'Always', 'most', 'humble', 'opinon']",N/A

The concert footage is... decent, but dated;  it is what it is based on the techology available at the time.  The sound is decent.  The concert and performance is excellent.  Furthermore, some of the versions of their classic tunes are awesome.  I'll just leave it at that, but the performance you'll see in this concert is fairly unique, especially when compared to their gigs later on.  Highly recommended.",4,A blast from the past,1299110400,"03 3, 2011",2011,548,"['1', 'have', 'several', 'EWF', 'concert', 'videos', 'have', 'pros', '/', 'cons', 'However', 'brainer', 'purchase', 'semi-hardcore', 'EWF', 'fan', 'concert', 'footage', 'decent', 'dated', 'what', 'based', 'techology', 'available', 'time', 'sound', 'decent', 'concert', 'performance', 'excellent', 'Furthermore', 'versions', 'classic', 'tunes', 'are', 'awesome', ""'ll"", 'just', 'leave', 'performance', ""'ll"", 'see', 'concert', 'fairly', 'unique', 'especially', 'when', 'compared', 'gigs', 'later', 'Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

I saw that it was EWF's Japan Concert and so picked it up, checked it out and bought it. It was a $5.99 special!Well, let me say that I love this DVD. For a long time I was a distant fan and didn't buy their stuff but many of their songs are very memorable. Many of those songs are on this concert. Being that this took place in 1990, the band was at the height of its game and featured their best band. The musicians are simply stellar on this band. Also, for being 22+ years ago, the recording is really decent. Great sound and very decent camera work.The excitement that this DVD exudes is engaging. I am major glad I happened on this one folks.
