His acting was superb and while I wasn't sure the actress that played the heroine was the perfect choice with Salman but somehow it seemed to work after watching it halfway through. Simply love all the song and dance routines in this movie,especially "" Jalwa"" and ""Love Me, Love Me"" - Salman might not dance like Hrithik Roshan but he did a superb job withthat body! WANTED has a good story line, basically about a hired assassin(Salman) working amongst the mafias and the corrupt police but with an agenda of his own.

1296491,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B002VYJX8S,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[4, 4]","To tell the truth, I've never cared all that much for Salman Khan, what with the muscles and all the posing and the tabloid stuff. But I'll say this, he's very good in WANTED and convincingly inhabits the part of the unstoppable Radhe. He makes you forget all the baggage. Salman Khan is in his 40s now but give him credit for still being able to pull off the really trying, physical aspects his role calls for. There's a lot of stunts in this one, and the guy does a fair number of them. Not to mention all the exhausting musical numbers.The plot: As gang wars erupt in Mumbai, one man begins to make his mark. Radhe is a ruthless gangster, a vicious enforcer willing to work for whoever will pay him. He comes across almost as this elemental force, absolutely fearless and willing to tweak the noses of even the most lofty of underworld dons. But Radhe isn't all badass killer. He occasionally does exhibit a softer side, especially whenever the curvy and wholesome Jhanvi (Ayesha Takia) is around, and then he melts in her presence. When Jhanvi is harassed by a shady police inspector, Radhe is inspired to even more extravagant lengths of meanness and brutality.It's not much of a plot and yet WANTED, with its polished look and breakneck pace, doesn't exactly lack for confidence. It's an unapologetic, freewheeling masala Hindi film. It flirts with a sweet romance, well-choreographed musical numbers, that intense gangster vibe, ridiculously over-the-top action, and some unexpected laughs (but also some lame stabs at humor, thanks to that chubby landlord guy). WANTED goes against convention in that the romance isn't more heavily featured, although we do get exposed to overwrought bits when Ayesha Takia's character struggles to come to terms with her having fallen in love with a murderous thug. Surprisingly, Ayesha and Salman's scenes together provide a good dose of levity.It's been a while since Salman Khan got a chance to kick asss and take names, and he seems to relish getting back into the mix. The action sequences tend to be more outrageous and stylish than realistic, and there's a lot of wire-fu going on here. But it's fun watching Salman Khan bring the attitude and take goons out with impunity. Note that both the two main bad guys exude an impressive aura of menace, so it's even more gratifying when they get what's coming to them. Salman Khan, he comes on as so indomitable that I might even put money on him if he ever got in a cage match with Krrish. And, for the female audience, what's a Salman Khan flick without his ripping his shirt off? Salman isn't about to pass up a chance to flex his guns.The film left me with the impression that it had more than the usual number of musical numbers. I was a little surprised to later find out that WANTED only featured six tracks, just about the normal amount in Indian cinema. Maybe it felt like there were more because the songs weren't spaced out evenly enough. Doesn't really matter. Thankfully, most of the musical numbers are dang watchable and catchy, especially the chilled out romantic song ""Dil Leke"" and the riveting ""Jalwa"" which features cameos by Anil Kapoor, Govinda, and the film's director Prabhu Deva. The few times I've seen Salman Khan onscreen, I wasn't too impressed with his dancing skills. This is the best I've ever seen him, and to see him bust out the dynamic moves in ""Jalwa"" (my favorite song here) was a bit of a revelation.Disc 1 has the feature film and scene and song selections. Disc 2 has these bonus features: 5 minutes of deleted scenes (no sub-titles), including an extended train sequence (which begins with Radhe and Jhanvi exchanging numbers) and also new annoying bits with that fat landlord guy; the music videos ""Mitti Ke Sine"" and ""Ishq Vishq"" (which I don't remember being in the movie); the Making Of the music video ""Mitti Ke Sine""; remixes of ""Love Me, Love Me,"" ""Ishq Vishq,"" and Jalwa""; and a 20-minute Behind the Scenes look at WANTED, enough of it in English that non-Hindi speaking cats like me can follow along.",4,shirtless force of nature Salman Khan,1264896000,"01 31, 2010",2010,4044,"['tell', 'truth', ""'ve"", 'never', 'cared', 'that', 'much', 'Salman', 'Khan', 'what', 'muscles', 'posing', 'tabloid', 'stuff', ""'ll"", 'say', 'very', 'good', 'WANTED', 'convincingly', 'part', 'unstoppable', 'Radhe', 'forget', 'baggage', 'Salman', 'Khan', '40s', 'now', 'give', 'credit', 'still', 'being', 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'really', 'trying', 'physical', 'aspects', 'role', 'lot', 'stunts', 'one', 'guy', 'fair', 'number', 'Not', 'mention', 'exhausting', 'musical', 'numbers.The', 'plot', 'gang', 'wars', 'erupt', 'Mumbai', 'one', 'man', 'make', 'mark', 'Radhe', 'ruthless', 'gangster', 'vicious', 'enforcer', 'willing', 'work', 'whoever', 'will', 'pay', 'across', 'almost', 'elemental', 'force', 'absolutely', 'fearless', 'willing', 'tweak', 'noses', 'even', 'most', 'lofty', 'underworld', 'dons', 'Radhe', ""n't"", 'badass', 'killer', 'occasionally', 'exhibit', 'softer', 'side', 'especially', 'whenever', 'curvy', 'wholesome', 'Jhanvi', 'Ayesha', 'Takia', 'around', 'then', 'presence', 'When', 'Jhanvi', 'harassed', 'shady', 'police', 'inspector', 'Radhe', 'inspired', 'even', 'more', 'extravagant', 'lengths', 'meanness', 'brutality.It', 'not', 'much', 'plot', 'yet', 'WANTED', 'polished', 'look', 'breakneck', 'pace', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'lack', 'confidence', 'unapologetic', 'freewheeling', 'masala', 'Hindi', 'film', 'sweet', 'romance', 'well-choreographed', 'musical', 'numbers', 'intense', 'gangster', 'vibe', 'ridiculously', 'over-the-top', 'action', 'unexpected', 'laughs', 'also', 'lame', 'stabs', 'humor', 'thanks', 'chubby', 'landlord', 'guy', 'WANTED', 'convention', 'romance', ""n't"", 'more', 'heavily', 'featured', 'do', 'get', 'exposed', 'overwrought', 'bits', 'when', 'Ayesha', 'Takia', 'character', 'come', 'terms', 'having', 'fallen', 'love', 'murderous', 'thug', 'Surprisingly', 'Ayesha', 'Salman', 'scenes', 'together', 'provide', 'good', 'dose', 'levity.It', 'been', 'while', 'Salman', 'Khan', 'got', 'chance', 'kick', 'asss', 'take', 'names', 'relish', 'getting', 'back', 'mix', 'action', 'sequences', 'tend', 'be', 'more', 'outrageous', 'stylish', 'realistic', 'lot', 'wire-fu', 'going', 'here', 'fun', 'watching', 'Salman', 'Khan', 'bring', 'attitude', 'take', 'goons', 'out', 'impunity', 'Note', 'two', 'main', 'bad', 'guys', 'exude', 'impressive', 'aura', 'menace', 'even', 'more', 'gratifying', 'when', 'get', 'what', 'coming', 'Salman', 'Khan', 'so', 'indomitable', 'might', 'even', 'put', 'money', 'ever', 'got', 'cage', 'match', 'Krrish', 'female', 'audience', 'what', 'Salman', 'Khan', 'flick', 'ripping', 'shirt', 'off', 'Salman', ""n't"", 'about', 'pass', 'up', 'chance', 'flex', 'guns.The', 'film', 'left', 'impression', 'had', 'more', 'usual', 'number', 'musical', 'numbers', 'was', 'little', 'surprised', 'later', 'find', 'out', 'WANTED', 'only', 'featured', 'six', 'tracks', 'just', 'normal', 'amount', 'Indian', 'cinema', 'felt', 'were', 'more', 'songs', 'were', ""n't"", 'spaced', 'out', 'evenly', 'enough', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'Thankfully', 'most', 'musical', 'numbers', 'are', 'dang', 'watchable', 'catchy', 'especially', 'chilled', 'out', 'romantic', 'song', 'Dil', 'Leke', 'riveting', 'Jalwa', 'cameos', 'Anil', 'Kapoor', 'Govinda', 'film', 'director', 'Prabhu', 'Deva', 'few', 'times', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Salman', 'Khan', 'onscreen', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'impressed', 'dancing', 'skills', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'see', 'bust', 'out', 'dynamic', 'moves', 'Jalwa', 'favorite', 'song', 'here', 'was', 'bit', 'revelation.Disc', '1', 'feature', 'film', 'scene', 'song', 'selections', 'Disc', '2', 'bonus', 'features', '5', 'minutes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'sub-titles', 'including', 'extended', 'train', 'sequence', 'Radhe', 'Jhanvi', 'exchanging', 'numbers', 'also', 'new', 'annoying', 'bits', 'fat', 'landlord', 'guy', 'music', 'Mitti', 'Ke', 'Sine', 'Ishq', 'Vishq', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'being', 'movie', 'Making', 'music', 'video', 'Mitti', 'Ke', 'Sine', 'remixes', 'Love', 'Me', 'Love', 'Me', 'Ishq', 'Vishq', 'Jalwa', '20-minute', 'Scenes', 'look', 'WANTED', 'enough', 'English', 'non-Hindi', 'speaking', 'cats', 'can', 'follow', 'along']",N/A
1296492,AE3D2GUK0SKX3,B002VYJX8S,Larry,"[13, 13]","""Wanted"" emerged as one of the top Blockblusters of Bollywood in 2009. It is filled with wall to wall action, song and dance, comedy and romance.  Bollywood superstar Salman Khan(son of superstar sceenwriter Salim Khan), after years of mediocre movies, returns with a hit this time.  He is badas* in this flick as a goon available for hire.  The mafia wants him to do their dirty jobs, he falls for a sweet girl, and he has to deal with corrupt cops as well as gansters.  The movie, like most Indian movies, is over 2 and a half hours long.  But I was never bored.  Towards the last hour, things starts to get exciting. I won't spoil the surprises.  But I totally enjoyed this movie, even going back to watch parts of it.This movie is the Hindi remake of the Tamil movie of the excellent blockbuster Telugu movie ""Pokiri""-written and directed by the talented Puri Jagannadh.  Prabhu Deva is a famed dancer/choreographer turned director who directed the Tamil remake(""Pokkiri"") as well as the Hindi(Bollywood) version.  He makes an appearance as a dancer in the song ""Jalwa"", he's the last guy who appears and dances real good next to Salman.I dug up the original ""Pokiri"" and it is nearly identical to the remakes, scene by scene, line by line.  They are smart not to mess up a good thing.  ""Wanted""(also known as ""Wanted Dead And Alive"")  is a little more glossy but the other two are quite polished as well.  The major difference is.. Salman gives a superb performance, and takes off his shirt at the end.Fun and exciting, I highly recommend this DVD.",5,"Action, comedy, romance, musical.. excellent Bollywood hit is a keeper!",1259798400,"12 3, 2009",2009,1553,"['Wanted', 'emerged', 'one', 'top', 'Blockblusters', 'Bollywood', '2009', 'filled', 'wall', 'wall', 'action', 'song', 'dance', 'comedy', 'romance', 'Bollywood', 'superstar', 'Salman', 'Khan', 'son', 'superstar', 'sceenwriter', 'Salim', 'Khan', 'years', 'mediocre', 'movies', 'returns', 'hit', 'time', 'badas*', 'flick', 'goon', 'available', 'hire', 'mafia', 'do', 'dirty', 'jobs', 'sweet', 'girl', 'deal', 'corrupt', 'cops', 'as', 'well', 'gansters', 'movie', 'most', 'Indian', 'movies', '2', 'half', 'hours', 'long', 'was', 'never', 'bored', 'last', 'hour', 'things', 'starts', 'get', 'exciting', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'surprises', 'totally', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'even', 'going', 'back', 'watch', 'parts', 'it.This', 'movie', 'Hindi', 'remake', 'Tamil', 'movie', 'excellent', 'blockbuster', 'Telugu', 'movie', 'Pokiri', '-written', 'directed', 'talented', 'Puri', 'Jagannadh', 'Prabhu', 'Deva', 'famed', 'dancer/choreographer', 'turned', 'director', 'who', 'directed', 'Tamil', 'remake', 'Pokkiri', 'as', 'well', 'Hindi', 'Bollywood', 'version', 'appearance', 'dancer', 'song', 'Jalwa', 'last', 'guy', 'who', 'dances', 'real', 'good', 'next', 'Salman.I', 'dug', 'up', 'original', 'Pokiri', 'nearly', 'identical', 'remakes', 'scene', 'scene', 'line', 'line', 'are', 'smart', 'not', 'mess', 'up', 'good', 'thing', 'Wanted', 'also', 'known', 'Wanted', 'Dead', 'Alive', 'little', 'more', 'glossy', 'other', 'two', 'are', 'quite', 'polished', 'as', 'well', 'major', 'difference', 'is..', 'Salman', 'superb', 'performance', 'off', 'shirt', 'end.Fun', 'exciting', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD']",N/A
1296493,A14H191AH66PPK,B002VYJX8S,Traddles,"[2, 2]","Protector of women, killer of the bad guys, and smokin' hot while doing it!  In interviews, Salman Khan has said that films need heroes - the people you cheer for unabashedly in a world where the bad guys always deserve a sound thrashing.  This is one of those films, and it's one of my favorites with Salman Khan. It's a slick, sophisticated blend of action, comedy, and romance, and Salman fits it perfectly. He plays an adorable thug (with a secret twist to his character), paired off with the equally adorable Ayesha Takia. The action sequences are stunning, but it's the romantic moments, which range from sweet to laugh-out-loud hilarious, that ultimately make me love the film.  Scenes in elevators, trains, and subway platforms highlight the amusing awkwardness of new romance.  One might think that Salman Khan is a bit too mature to be playing a ""boyfriend"" role more appropriate for a 20-year-old, but he pulls it off beautifully through sheer force of charm.  The scene in which he and Ayesha argue over a tupperware container of pasta still makes me laugh.The music of Sajid-Wajid is fantastic, and this is one of the first Hindi action movies that had me noticing the catchiness of the background score in addition to the dance numbers.  The first dance sequence (""Mera Jalwa"") is jaw-dropping - the choreography is amazing, and Salman has never danced better. Seriously.  The dance also features three cameos that will surprise you (if you're familiar with Indian actors).  ""Dil Leke Darde Dil"" is sweetly sexy and rhythmic.In summary, the action is stunning, the villains are truly villainous, and the romance is sweet. It almost feels like a trial run for the character that Salman would perfect in the following year's ""Dabangg"".",5,A Hindi Cinema Blockbuster,1302048000,"04 6, 2011",2011,1747,"['Protector', 'women', 'killer', 'bad', 'guys', 'smokin', 'hot', 'doing', 'interviews', 'Salman', 'Khan', 'said', 'films', 'need', 'heroes', 'people', 'cheer', 'unabashedly', 'world', 'where', 'bad', 'guys', 'always', 'deserve', 'sound', 'thrashing', 'one', 'films', 'one', 'favorites', 'Salman', 'Khan', 'slick', 'sophisticated', 'blend', 'action', 'comedy', 'romance', 'Salman', 'perfectly', 'adorable', 'thug', 'secret', 'twist', 'character', 'paired', 'off', 'equally', 'adorable', 'Ayesha', 'Takia', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'stunning', 'romantic', 'moments', 'range', 'sweet', 'laugh-out-loud', 'hilarious', 'ultimately', 'make', 'love', 'film', 'Scenes', 'elevators', 'trains', 'subway', 'platforms', 'highlight', 'amusing', 'awkwardness', 'new', 'romance', 'One', 'might', 'think', 'Salman', 'Khan', 'bit', 'too', 'mature', 'be', 'playing', 'boyfriend', 'role', 'more', 'appropriate', '20-year-old', 'off', 'beautifully', 'sheer', 'force', 'charm', 'scene', 'Ayesha', 'argue', 'tupperware', 'container', 'pasta', 'still', 'laugh.The', 'music', 'Sajid-Wajid', 'fantastic', 'one', 'first', 'Hindi', 'action', 'movies', 'had', 'noticing', 'catchiness', 'background', 'score', 'addition', 'dance', 'numbers', 'first', 'dance', 'sequence', 'Mera', 'Jalwa', 'jaw-dropping', 'choreography', 'amazing', 'Salman', 'never', 'danced', 'better', 'Seriously', 'dance', 'also', 'three', 'cameos', 'will', 'surprise', ""'re"", 'familiar', 'Indian', 'actors', 'Dil', 'Leke', 'Darde', 'Dil', 'sweetly', 'sexy', 'rhythmic.In', 'summary', 'action', 'stunning', 'villains', 'are', 'truly', 'villainous', 'romance', 'sweet', 'almost', 'feels', 'trial', 'run', 'character', 'Salman', 'would', 'perfect', 'following', 'year', 'Dabangg']",N/A
