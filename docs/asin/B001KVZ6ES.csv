1208761,A1ALOIPRR8Q06J,B001KVZ6ES,"2 cents ""meaningless memes""","[2, 3]","Splice Archie Bunker with Dirty Harry and you kind of get retired Detroit autoworker Walt Kowalski. But Kowalski cares about people more than Dirty Harry and Archie Bunker. And we learn why he is the way he is. At least part of the reason he is grouchy and kinda racist is because he has been through combat hell and it left him scared. He's a haunted man. He is from another time. His neighborhood has fallen apart and is filled with nonwhite poor people and thugs. Seems his Asian neighbors remind him of the lives he took as a young man in Korea all those years ago. Walt also squints his eyes and groans all the time because of his kids that he never connected with and are now spoiled, selfish jerks with spoiled brat selfish kids of their own whose behavior absolutely disgusts him. That the grandchildren seem like regular American kids is just depressing because they are unlikable little brats and the perspective of an old grouchy grandfather on the younger generation is both comical and truly sad. Old Walt lives out his remaining days after his wife's passing whose pathetic funeral with it's meaningless, phony eulogy and crummy, transparently uncaring family in attendance begins the film. He mows the lawn, keeps up his house, hangs out with his dog, drinks lots of Pabst Blue Ribbon (best beer for your buck imo). The priest who did the wife's funeral comes around repeatedly and tries to get him to go to confession because his wife made him promise her he would. One day a ""gook"" kid from next door tries to steal Walt's vintage car but gets caught. Racial epitaphs are fired off freely by Walt and it's pretty funny. Soon after the Asian Hmong gang comes around to pick on the neighbor and Walt comes out with his old M-1 rifle and scares 'em off. The Asian neighbors all appreciate this and he is awarded with many food gifts and offerings which he doesn't want. Anyway, you might can guess what comes next: Walt ends up sort of mentoring the teenage boy who is really not so bad and was just pressured into theivery. I'll leave out the details of how this relationship comes about which aren't surprising. Of coarse much worse trouble comes from the moron gang and...well I'd say go see the movie. It's pretty good. If your an Eastwood admirer GRAN TORINO is not to be missed. It's a good story. And if your white I think you'll especially like it, but I'll not get into why. In anycase it's another well crafted Clint Eastwood picture and a good story. And not everything in the narative is predictable.",4,unforgiven,1232064000,"01 16, 2009",2009,2526,"['Splice', 'Archie', 'Bunker', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'kind', 'get', 'retired', 'Detroit', 'autoworker', 'Walt', 'Kowalski', 'Kowalski', 'people', 'more', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'Archie', 'Bunker', 'learn', 'why', 'way', 'least', 'part', 'reason', 'grouchy', 'kinda', 'racist', 'been', 'combat', 'hell', 'left', 'scared', 'haunted', 'man', 'time', 'neighborhood', 'fallen', 'apart', 'filled', 'nonwhite', 'poor', 'people', 'thugs', 'Seems', 'Asian', 'neighbors', 'remind', 'lives', 'took', 'young', 'man', 'Korea', 'years', 'ago', 'Walt', 'also', 'eyes', 'groans', 'time', 'kids', 'never', 'connected', 'are', 'now', 'spoiled', 'selfish', 'jerks', 'spoiled', 'brat', 'selfish', 'kids', 'own', 'behavior', 'absolutely', 'grandchildren', 'seem', 'regular', 'American', 'kids', 'just', 'depressing', 'are', 'unlikable', 'little', 'brats', 'perspective', 'old', 'grouchy', 'grandfather', 'younger', 'generation', 'comical', 'truly', 'sad', 'Old', 'Walt', 'out', 'remaining', 'days', 'wife', 'passing', 'pathetic', 'funeral', 'meaningless', 'phony', 'eulogy', 'crummy', 'transparently', 'uncaring', 'family', 'attendance', 'film', 'lawn', 'up', 'house', 'out', 'dog', 'lots', 'Pabst', 'Blue', 'Ribbon', 'best', 'beer', 'buck', 'imo', 'priest', 'who', 'did', 'wife', 'funeral', 'around', 'repeatedly', 'tries', 'get', 'go', 'confession', 'wife', 'made', 'promise', 'would', 'One', 'day', 'gook', 'kid', 'next', 'door', 'tries', 'steal', 'Walt', 'vintage', 'car', 'caught', 'Racial', 'epitaphs', 'are', 'fired', 'off', 'freely', 'Walt', 'pretty', 'funny', 'Soon', 'Asian', 'Hmong', 'gang', 'around', 'pick', 'neighbor', 'Walt', 'out', 'old', 'M-1', 'rifle', 'scares', 'off', 'Asian', 'neighbors', 'appreciate', 'awarded', 'many', 'food', 'gifts', 'offerings', ""n't"", 'want', 'Anyway', 'might', 'can', 'guess', 'what', 'next', 'Walt', 'up', 'sort', 'mentoring', 'teenage', 'boy', 'who', 'really', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'was', 'just', 'pressured', 'theivery', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'out', 'details', 'how', 'relationship', 'are', ""n't"", 'surprising', 'coarse', 'much', 'worse', 'trouble', 'moron', 'gang', 'well', ""'d"", 'say', 'go', 'see', 'movie', 'pretty', 'good', 'Eastwood', 'admirer', 'GRAN', 'TORINO', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'good', 'story', 'white', 'think', ""'ll"", 'especially', ""'ll"", 'not', 'get', 'why', 'anycase', 'well', 'crafted', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'picture', 'good', 'story', 'not', 'everything', 'narative', 'predictable']",Gran Torino

There is a lot of cussing and foul language in this film but if you can overlook that and see the message in the film you will enjoy it.  The relationship Clint and the young man, Clint's neighbor, develop is brought along very well.One part in the film I enjoyed was when his neighbors were continually bringing food to his home to show appreciation for his kindness.  Clint at first tries to shoo them away because so much food has already been given to him.

Fiercely loyal, patriotic and extremely persnickety, he owns a mint condition 1972 Gran Torino Sport, which is his pride and joy.3. He's a cantankerous old cuss, who doesn't suffer fools, especially the ones he's related to.4. His neighborhood is going to hell.5. Despite his gruff demeanor, Walt gets involved with a couple of gangs while rendering assistance to his Hmong neighbors6. The parish priest and two teenagers finally get him around to at least liking his neighbors a little.7. Things get out of hand between his new friends and a Hmong gang.8. Walt handles things in his own inimitable way.A wonderfully snarly, gnarly performance by the veteran actor, well worth watching not only for the comedic bits relating to race, culture, religion and dysfunctional families, but also the gradual softening of that craggy exterior.Thao Vang Lor: What was it like to kill someone?Walt Kowalski: You don't want to know.Amanda Richards, March 4, 2009",5,Man among the Hmong,1236124800,"03 4, 2009",2009,1211,"['Walt', 'Kowalski', ""'ll"", 'blow', 'hole', 'face', 'then', 'go', 'inside', 'sleep', 'baby.Short', 'Attention', 'Span', 'Summary', 'SASS', ':1', 'Walt', 'Kowalski', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Korean', 'War', 'veteran', 'who', 'worked', 'assembly', 'line', 'Ford', 'automobile', 'company', 'Fiercely', 'loyal', 'patriotic', 'extremely', 'persnickety', 'mint', 'condition', '1972', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'Sport', 'pride', 'joy.3', 'cantankerous', 'old', 'cuss', 'who', ""n't"", 'suffer', 'fools', 'especially', 'ones', 'related', 'to.4', 'neighborhood', 'going', 'hell.5', 'gruff', 'demeanor', 'Walt', 'involved', 'couple', 'gangs', 'rendering', 'assistance', 'Hmong', 'neighbors6', 'parish', 'priest', 'two', 'teenagers', 'finally', 'get', 'around', 'least', 'liking', 'neighbors', 'little.7', 'Things', 'get', 'hand', 'new', 'friends', 'Hmong', 'gang.8', 'Walt', 'things', 'own', 'inimitable', 'way.A', 'wonderfully', 'snarly', 'gnarly', 'performance', 'veteran', 'actor', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'not', 'only', 'comedic', 'bits', 'relating', 'race', 'culture', 'religion', 'dysfunctional', 'families', 'also', 'gradual', 'softening', 'craggy', 'exterior.Thao', 'Vang', 'Lor', 'What', 'was', 'kill', 'someone', 'Walt', 'Kowalski', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'know.Amanda', 'Richards', 'March', '4', '2009']",Gran Torino

This was the sort of movie that cinema is made for. Even being a hard R-rated dramatic character study, it manages to be not just lightly humorous, but outright laugh-out-loud hilarious in almost every scene, without ever disrupting the tone of the movie or the mood.The film is indeed about Walt Kowalski, which Clint Eastwood plays in a way not far from the movie personas that made him famous, and yet easily encompassing how someone would imagine someone like Dirty Harry as an 80+ year old man. He seems as though he's not ""Clint Eastwood playing a crusty old racist"" but rather ""A crusty old racist playing himself"". No matter how many racist terms he tosses out, it's always in a way that doesn't seem in any way out of the ordinary or like too much of a step for Eastwood to draw out in his acting.And so many of the scenes from the snarling stares given to his family and friends during his wife's funeral, to chewing out priest Janovich, sparring with Sue back and forth, there's always hilarity to be had when he starts growling or mumbling something in a voice close to Batman in ""The Dark Knight"".Yet despite his cantankerousness, racism, and stubborn need to be self-sufficient, he never ventures into the realm of disgusting or (overly)violent; he seems just as ready to string out a racist rant against ghetto-looking street thugs as he is against sheet-wearing hillbillies.The burgeoning friendship that builds between Walt and Thao is sweet without stepping into being saccharine, and the climax of the film is intense, causing a great change in Walt that would seem fully unexpected in a movie character, yet in this context is not only done brilliantly, but Clint Eastwood develops his character so thoroughly, that he becomes the character as deeply and richly as Daniel Day-Lewis did Daniel Plainview in ""There Will Be Blood"": You fully believe Walt Kowalski could be a real person. He is in no way a hero or a villain, but just a normal person.To the end of the film, Walt remains an unrepentant racist and bitter, cantankerous old man hateful of almost anything, but where his own family is alienated from his life, he seems to gain a new one in the form of Thao and his family.",5,"Easily funnier than any comedy, heartbreaking and heartwarming",1233100800,"01 28, 2009",2009,2285,"['would', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'start', 'heaping', 'more', 'more', 'praise', 'movie', 'was', 'sort', 'movie', 'cinema', 'made', 'Even', 'being', 'hard', 'R-rated', 'dramatic', 'character', 'study', 'be', 'not', 'just', 'lightly', 'humorous', 'outright', 'laugh-out-loud', 'hilarious', 'almost', 'scene', 'ever', 'disrupting', 'tone', 'movie', 'mood.The', 'film', 'indeed', 'Walt', 'Kowalski', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'way', 'not', 'far', 'movie', 'personas', 'made', 'famous', 'yet', 'easily', 'encompassing', 'how', 'someone', 'would', 'imagine', 'someone', 'Dirty', 'Harry', '80+', 'year', 'old', 'man', 'not', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'playing', 'crusty', 'old', 'racist', 'rather', 'A', 'crusty', 'old', 'racist', 'playing', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'racist', 'terms', 'out', 'always', 'way', ""n't"", 'seem', 'way', 'ordinary', 'like', 'too', 'much', 'step', 'Eastwood', 'draw', 'out', 'acting.And', 'so', 'many', 'scenes', 'snarling', 'given', 'family', 'friends', 'wife', 'funeral', 'chewing', 'out', 'priest', 'Janovich', 'sparring', 'Sue', 'back', 'forth', 'always', 'hilarity', 'be', 'had', 'when', 'growling', 'mumbling', 'something', 'voice', 'close', 'Batman', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'cantankerousness', 'racism', 'stubborn', 'need', 'be', 'self-sufficient', 'never', 'ventures', 'realm', 'disgusting', 'overly', 'violent', 'just', 'as', 'ready', 'string', 'out', 'racist', 'rant', 'ghetto-looking', 'street', 'thugs', 'sheet-wearing', 'hillbillies.The', 'burgeoning', 'friendship', 'Walt', 'Thao', 'sweet', 'stepping', 'being', 'saccharine', 'climax', 'film', 'intense', 'causing', 'great', 'change', 'Walt', 'would', 'seem', 'fully', 'unexpected', 'movie', 'character', 'yet', 'context', 'not', 'only', 'done', 'brilliantly', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'character', 'so', 'thoroughly', 'character', 'deeply', 'richly', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'did', 'Daniel', 'Plainview', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'fully', 'believe', 'Walt', 'Kowalski', 'could', 'be', 'real', 'person', 'way', 'hero', 'villain', 'just', 'normal', 'person.To', 'end', 'film', 'Walt', 'unrepentant', 'racist', 'bitter', 'cantankerous', 'old', 'man', 'hateful', 'almost', 'anything', 'where', 'own', 'family', 'alienated', 'life', 'gain', 'new', 'one', 'form', 'Thao', 'family']",Gran Torino

He has also become estranged from his two sons  who see their father as needlessly difficult and unyielding.  He is alone except for his father Labrador dog.Walt is drawn into the Hmong community when he settles a neighbourhood dispute.  He does this through the  barrel of a gun!  Shades of Dirty Harry.  But Walt is more than such a one dimensional character.  With time, he comes to appreciate his Hmong neighbours and grows closer to them than his own family.  Coinciding with the above, Walt is an ongoing dispute of sorts with his late wife's priest who is a nave young do-gooder with little knowledge of the real world.  Walt has no time for his late wife's faith.The contrast between Walt and the Hmong is handled well.  It leads to Walt being a better man.  He is happy to assist them and they return his efforts with gratitude.  It wasn't always like this as a young Hmong man, Thao, was instructed to steal Walt's beautifully maintained Ford Gran Torino.  The young man repents and the relationship with Walt grows from this point.If I was to have one criticism of the film it is that its end is somewhat overdone.  It could even be called corny.  This is a pity.  ""Gran Torino"" has so much to offer.  Yet, despite this point, Cline Eastwood has excelled as produce r, director and star.  And this from a man of 78!

1208780,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B001KVZ6ES,Andrew Ellington,"[17, 62]","Betty, I know you are going to hate me for this, but I have to be honest here.  This movie was just horrible.  It's hard for me to put into eloquent words all of the missteps this poor little film made, because part of me just feels like rambling off a list of bad decisions.First, I'll lay out the plot.Walt is a bitter and grumpy old man who is an unapologetic racist dwelling in a community overrun by those with which he has hatred for.  His family has all but written him off, and this visibly irks Walt.  When his neighbor, young Thao, attempts to steal his Gran Torino (as part of a gang initiation), Walt finds himself in a situation (with individuals) he never foresaw.  After inadvertently saving Thao from the clutches of his cousin's gang, Walt is further introduced to Thao's family, and despite being hesitant he begins to warm to Thao after he officially apologizes.  Walt then has Thao become his `handyman', putting him to work around the house doing odd jobs here and there.  Things seem to go well for the two, and a bond is formed, but if we know anything about gangs we know that this will not be the end of things.The story felt VERY clich&eacute;d and it didn't really try to compensate for those obvious generalizations.  Some make remarks like ""this is far better than `Crash'"" but in the end they are both rather embarrassing reflections of racism to be quite honest.  I'd like you to explain to me HOW this is better than `Crash'.  I won't say it is worse (although I gave `Crash' a C, my feelings for that film have dropped considerably), but it is hardly better.So let's take this apart, shall we.I'll start with the script.  Like I said, there are clich&eacute;s that pretty much mount one on top of the other here, from the formulaic way in which Thao's family is represented to the ridiculously generic way that Walt is presented to us.  There is nothing genuine about his character.  Everything feels pulled from another performance or character developed in an Eastwood movie.  This is Eastwood playing Eastwood.  He is grumpy, and everyone knows it, and his family has distanced themselves from him (who can blame them) and yet we are supposed to feel an urge of sympathy for him because he overcomes his racism and befriends Thao and his family?  I found the scene in the barbershop with Thao to be rather ridiculous too.  Yes, this is the type of guy that Walt is, but it's nothing to feel all chummy about.  The way the film ended I thought was (somewhat) clever, and then it went all Hallmark sentiment with the final frame, which I found a tad squeamish.How about the direction, since that is what Eastwood is all about?  Honestly, this film lacks tremendously in that regard.  Now, for all of you out there (yes, you MKIA) who think that I am an Eastwood hater and that I'm blowing this out of proportion, realize that I gave `Million Dollar Baby' an A+ and still highly regard that film (and it's direction), not to mention an A for `Unforgiven', and despite not caring for it collectively, I gave pretty high marks to `Changeling' as well.  This film though, is just poorly constructed and realized.  The direction is very stagy.  Look at the scene when the family is worried about Sue and she comes in the door, and Walt drops his drink.  Watch how the camera zooms into a closeup of the drink, telling us that Walt is going to drop it before he does and then, what does Walt do...he lets go.  It's not a `disoriented slip through his fingers' drop, it's an `open my hand and make a statement' drop.  It just feels fake.  Decisions like that one give this film an air of unnaturalness that ruins any connective tissue.But, the acting takes the cake here.  Casting `non-actors' is kind of a vanity thing for a director, but in the end there are moments where it works.  This is not one of them.  Bee Vang has to carry about as much of this film as Eastwood (we'll get to him in a minute) and so he needed to be more authenticated.  I love how one reviewer makes the statement that while Vang comes off wooden, ""there is no substitute for authenticity.""  Sorry, but that wooden quality strips the performance of authenticity.  He's obviously trying too hard.  Eastwood, like I mentioned earlier, is just playing himself.  Yes, the script is at fault for handing him a caricature (I don't care what you say about his character arc, it just boils down to a mess of generalities) but Eastwood doesn't put any real life into it.Snarling and growling and looking all mean and stuff is not really emoting, like at all.In the end, this overcooked film is just a mess.  I'm sorry Betty, I know you love your Clint (and I won't hold that against you if you don't hold this review against me) but this film is just plain bad.  Maybe the whole racism subject should just be left alone, since no one can really seem to get it right (is it just me or was this another one of those `white guy saves the day' kind of message films), but then again it is a potent subject that has potential to really create something poignant.This is not poignant.",1,(not so) Grand Burrito...,1280880000,"08 4, 2010",2010,5074,"['Betty', 'know', 'are', 'going', 'hate', 'have', 'be', 'honest', 'here', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'horrible', 'hard', 'put', 'eloquent', 'words', 'missteps', 'poor', 'little', 'film', 'made', 'part', 'just', 'feels', 'rambling', 'off', 'list', 'bad', 'decisions.First', ""'ll"", 'lay', 'out', 'plot.Walt', 'bitter', 'grumpy', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'unapologetic', 'racist', 'dwelling', 'community', 'overrun', 'hatred', 'family', 'written', 'off', 'visibly', 'Walt', 'When', 'neighbor', 'young', 'Thao', 'steal', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'part', 'gang', 'initiation', 'Walt', 'situation', 'individuals', 'never', 'foresaw', 'inadvertently', 'saving', 'Thao', 'clutches', 'cousin', 'gang', 'Walt', 'further', 'introduced', 'Thao', 'family', 'being', 'hesitant', 'warm', 'Thao', 'officially', 'Walt', 'then', 'Thao', 'become', 'handyman', 'putting', 'work', 'house', 'doing', 'odd', 'jobs', 'here', 'there', 'Things', 'seem', 'go', 'well', 'two', 'bond', 'formed', 'know', 'anything', 'gangs', 'know', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'end', 'things.The', 'story', 'felt', 'VERY', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'try', 'compensate', 'obvious', 'generalizations', 'make', 'remarks', 'far', 'better', 'Crash', 'end', 'are', 'rather', 'embarrassing', 'reflections', 'racism', 'be', 'quite', 'honest', ""'d"", 'like', 'explain', 'HOW', 'better', 'Crash', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'worse', 'gave', 'Crash', 'C', 'feelings', 'film', 'have', 'dropped', 'considerably', 'hardly', 'better.So', 'let', 'take', 'apart', 'shall', 'we.I', ""'ll"", 'start', 'script', 'said', 'are', 'clich', 'eacute', 'pretty', 'much', 'mount', 'one', 'top', 'other', 'here', 'formulaic', 'way', 'Thao', 'family', 'represented', 'ridiculously', 'generic', 'way', 'Walt', 'presented', 'nothing', 'genuine', 'character', 'Everything', 'feels', 'pulled', 'performance', 'character', 'developed', 'Eastwood', 'movie', 'Eastwood', 'playing', 'Eastwood', 'grumpy', 'everyone', 'family', 'distanced', 'who', 'can', 'blame', 'yet', 'are', 'supposed', 'feel', 'urge', 'sympathy', 'racism', 'Thao', 'family', 'found', 'scene', 'barbershop', 'Thao', 'be', 'rather', 'ridiculous', 'too', 'Yes', 'type', 'guy', 'Walt', 'nothing', 'feel', 'chummy', 'way', 'film', 'ended', 'thought', 'was', 'somewhat', 'clever', 'then', 'went', 'Hallmark', 'sentiment', 'final', 'frame', 'found', 'tad', 'squeamish.How', 'direction', 'what', 'Eastwood', 'Honestly', 'film', 'tremendously', 'regard', 'Now', 'there', 'yes', 'MKIA', 'who', 'think', 'am', 'Eastwood', 'hater', ""'m"", 'blowing', 'proportion', 'realize', 'gave', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'A+', 'still', 'highly', 'regard', 'film', 'direction', 'not', 'mention', 'A', 'Unforgiven', 'not', 'caring', 'collectively', 'gave', 'pretty', 'high', 'marks', 'Changeling', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'just', 'poorly', 'constructed', 'realized', 'direction', 'very', 'stagy', 'Look', 'scene', 'when', 'family', 'worried', 'Sue', 'door', 'Walt', 'drink', 'Watch', 'how', 'camera', 'closeup', 'drink', 'telling', 'Walt', 'going', 'drop', 'then', 'what', 'Walt', 'do', 'go', 'not', 'disoriented', 'slip', 'fingers', 'drop', 'open', 'hand', 'make', 'statement', 'drop', 'just', 'feels', 'fake', 'Decisions', 'one', 'give', 'film', 'air', 'unnaturalness', 'connective', 'tissue.But', 'acting', 'cake', 'here', 'Casting', 'non-actors', 'kind', 'vanity', 'thing', 'director', 'end', 'are', 'moments', 'where', 'not', 'one', 'Bee', 'Vang', 'carry', 'about', 'as', 'much', 'film', 'Eastwood', ""'ll"", 'get', 'minute', 'so', 'needed', 'be', 'more', 'authenticated', 'love', 'how', 'one', 'reviewer', 'statement', 'Vang', 'off', 'wooden', 'substitute', 'authenticity', 'Sorry', 'wooden', 'quality', 'performance', 'authenticity', 'obviously', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'Eastwood', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'just', 'playing', 'Yes', 'script', 'fault', 'handing', 'caricature', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'say', 'character', 'arc', 'just', 'down', 'mess', 'generalities', 'Eastwood', ""n't"", 'put', 'real', 'life', 'it.Snarling', 'growling', 'looking', 'mean', 'stuff', 'not', 'really', 'emoting', 'end', 'overcooked', 'film', 'just', 'mess', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'Betty', 'know', 'love', 'Clint', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hold', 'do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'review', 'film', 'just', 'plain', 'bad', 'Maybe', 'whole', 'racism', 'subject', 'should', 'just', 'be', 'left', 'alone', 'one', 'can', 'really', 'seem', 'get', 'right', 'just', 'was', 'one', 'white', 'guy', 'day', 'kind', 'message', 'films', 'then', 'again', 'potent', 'subject', 'potential', 'really', 'create', 'something', 'poignant.This', 'not', 'poignant']",Gran Torino

E Jackson,"[2, 2]","Well, after all the hype, I can say with complete honesty- this movie moved me in the way I was hoping it would.For the last several months I've been trying to find a way to watch Gran Torino.  All year long it was like the number one movie on my mind that I felt I simply HAD to watch.All the awards the film won, all the frequent mentions of Clint Eastwood blowing us away with his performance, and...the film was actually as good as most people said it would be.  This doesn't happen very often!I was seriously moved by the engaging storyline from beginning to end.Clint Eastwood playing the role of a stubborn old man that none of his family seems to care about and becoming bitter and angry at the world as a result was delivered *flawlessly*I'm a bit surprised the storyline focused so much on Clint's character building a relationship between his neighbors and himself, and less on the part about trying to protect his home from the never-ending gang fights taking place outside.The actual gang fights were about 50% of the film, while the other half dealt with Clint and the young boy from next store getting to know each other better and building a friendship through patience, hard work and a willingness for Clint to finally open up and accept his neighbors.This is truly a great movie with an ending that might move you in a way you've never felt before.  It's a bit of a shocking ending to me, but I guess the more I think about it while typing up this review, it's the kind of ending to be expected.I can't think of another way to make the outcome more realistic, while also keeping in mind that the intention of the writers while putting together this film was to make an impact on the viewers, let's put it that way.There's a couple hidden messages behind the storyline as well- always accept others, don't be so quick to judge, and never follow through with your initial reactions.  There's also a message that you can in fact change people who are always in trouble with the law.Overall, yeah, this movie is simply terrific the entire way through.

It combines elements of many of his classic characters, with the subtlety and depth 50 years on both sides of the camera has taught him. Some will howl at his language and obvious bigotry, but without this coarseness, we would not truly understand his pain, or fully appreciate his spiritual rebirth.This may sound crazy, but I found myself comparing ""Gran Torino"" with ""The Shootist"", John Wayne's final film. Both films involve protagonists who are dying of cancer, mentoring boys, and ultimately ending their lives while ridding society of a dangerous element. With due respect for Wayne, I believe the Eastwood film is far superior; Eastwood's characterization is much deeper, the 'community' is portrayed in a kinder fashion, and the resolution is both smarter, and more effective.

It's a film about some cantankerous, racist white guy who ends up being the white savior at the end or the white martyr.  The part of the film about Thao being vulnerable to a gang and nowhere future was believable but the part of how Walt takes him under his wing and gets him a job and gets him to talk like a man was just baloney.  It's sad that the only way this young boy can be acceptable to society is by talking like some racist white guy and getting a job because obviously there aren't any McDonalds where they live in Michigan.

When harm befalls the neighbors, Walt takes the law into his own hands.This film is a bit of a throwback to Clint's Dirty Harry days with more sophistication. It's entertaining if you enjoy the catharsis of seeing the bad guys get their comeupance, albeit with more of a twist this time around.The film still felt rather heavy handed, with stereotyped characters (remember the first Rambo movie? Aside from Walt's grudging conversion, ""Gran Torino"" is basically populated with the same type of sharply delineated characters).It's also predictable. As soon as Walt gets the close shave and new suit, you can pretty much guess how the film will conclude.That's cool if that's is the type of movie you want to see. Some lifelong Eastwood Fans might call it a return to form.It's just that I was expecting something more along the lines of ""Mystic River"" and ""Million Dollar Baby,"" where the characters were far more complex and the trajectories of the stories weren't as obvious, which made for compelling viewing.Finally, I know Clint likes to score his films, and his ususal solo piano or otherwise sparse arrangements support his movies well.

Of course, he does find his redemption, through the most unilkely of people.That Clint Eastwood is great in this film should come as no surprise.  The real surprise comes via two completely inexperienced actors, Ahney Her as Sue, and Bee Vang as Thao.  These two most unwelcome next door neighbors help Walt find his redemption, and give him the love and respect he gets from no one else.  Sharing the screen with Eastwood is no small task for any actor, no matter how experienced they might be. These two rose to the occasion.The details is this film are just perfect.  The casting is excellent, from top to bottom.  Eastwood's son, daughter-in-law, and grandaughter are played to perfection by Brian Haley, Geraldine Hughes, and Dreama Walker.  They are self-absorbed and clueless as to the needs of Walt.  Walker is the teenager you love to hate, especially when she is lusting after Walt's prize Gran Torino in anticipation of his ultimate death.  Haley and Hughes' good scene was when they showed up to Walt's house with what they thought were perfect birthday gifts.  The gifts of a ""grabber"" and a phone with huge numbers to this man who was still so vital was tasteless.  The scene played out perfectly.The extras and smaller parts were fantastic as well.  I especially enjoyed watching the thugs and gangbangers.  They looked great and were very believable.  The locations in gritty Detroit were just right.  Whatever time Eastwood and Team spent scouting locations really paid off.Finally, to release this most un-PC of films in hypersensitive Hollywood was ballsy on Eastwood's part.  You will hear more racial slurs than you thought existed.  These slurs are not gratuitous; rather, they define the Walt character and make his actions all the more important.Don't miss this one.

1208811,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B001KVZ6ES,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[1, 1]","I remember Clint Eastwood from tv on RAWHIDE at the start of his career.  I remember him in a musical western PAINT YOUR WAGON in 1969.  I remember him in all of those westerns plus his first foray as DIRTY HARRY.  I remember his getting fired from the studio he worked for as a tv star, not for bad behavior but for lack of talent.  I was one of those same stupid people back then that thought this guy was just coasting on his good looks and as soon as those were gone his career would be kaput.Well his good looks are gone but he has so much talent that he is bigger than ever as both a director and actor.  Having seen the Oscar winner, Sean Penn in MILK, recently, I really think it should have gone to Eastwood instead.  Not that Penn doesn't do his usual first class job.  No, it is that Eastwood inhabits every nuance of a truly original fictional character which I tend to appreciate a lot more than biography.  Further, Eastwood hits America right where all the people in it live emotionally and economically in this moment of time whereas MILK looked back to a brief shining moment in gay rights history in San Francisco.Eastwood is Walt Kowalski, a 78 year old recent widower and Korean Korean War veteran.  He is a retired auto worker in Detroit who still lives in his old neighborhood much to his family's consternation.  His proudest possession is his completely restored 1972 Gran Torino automobile.  The attempted theft of this auto by the Asian youth who lives next door sets off a richly nuanced relationship between the two, which slowly ripens into a friendship.  They each have their separate problems too.  Walt is hitting the end of the road medically as he coughs up blood and discovers his serious prognosis.  The youth and his family are being terrorized by an Asian gang to which his cousin belongs.  They want him to join them and when he won't, they ratchet up the violence towards the entire family.  We know how Dirty Harry would solve the problems in this movie.  Walt is not Dirty Harry.  He lives in the real world and has to find real world solutions to the problems before him.Eastwood is just wonderful as this character.  The movie itself is a fine piece of writing which Eastwood himself superbly directs.  Such a fuss was made about his CHANGELING (which he directed with Jolie in the lead), which came out in the same year.  Now that I've seen both, this is the better movie. The Walt character is just everything you've got to love long range about America and what we are so close to losing.  It's true.  They don't make them like Walt anymore.Eastwood himself closes the movie by singing in his Walt voice a song about his Gran Torino over the closing credits.

Mr. Eastwood is a veteran in Hollywood movies, as you can tell. His acting is just excellent and each movie, he plays his part well. Like in this movie, he plays as a grumpy old man (in his 70's), who is an ex-war veteran living in Michigan, who unfortunately lost his wife. An Asian family moves in next door, and he ends up making a bond with them, despite their differences.My opinion of this movie is that the acting by all characters is great. I think that the movie is sort of stereotypical at times such as when the old guy calls the Asians every name in the book (i.e. ""Gooks""), or like when he punks some black kids who tries to take the Asian girl (and the person she was walking with). I understand that the setting of the movie is here in 2008/2009, so there is a lot of common ground here (some people may say it's for the better).Overall Eastwood directed a great movie, as him playing the main character, and teaching a young boy how to live for himself.

She not only holds her own, but then some!  The brother character took a while to grow on me but grow he did, and the one gang member (can't recall his name) who ""flipped Walt off"" was also very convincing.  My oldest son and I both laughed at the things he said because his character reminded us--and I imagine will remind a lot of people--of people like that, that they know or have known.I've been a fan of Clint for years now, and it isn't a matter of whether he still has IT! He definitely does!  This movie is a MUST SEE and an eye-opener for those that aren't aware of this very real world.This movie couldn't be more aptly named because of all the people on the planet, (and having traveled a bit of it), I would have to say that Americans have the most ""mad love"" for cars!The barber is also an integral part of making this movie work, but you'll have to see it to see why I say that.Last, I watched this by myself because no one was home at the time I bought it, then again with my wife and son, and I have to say, it was even better, the second time around because there were subtle things that got by me the first time.

What we have here is a cross-generational, cross-cultural story about people who can learn so much from each other despite being different. It's about regret, sadness, redemption, and growth, which isn't to say that it's conventional or archetypal; Eastwood plays a contemporary version of a Wise Old Man, someone who draws on life experience to teach an undeveloped youth. What's unique is that, regardless of what life has taught him, this Wise Old Man still has a lot to learn.He has a name, of course: retired Ford factory worker Walt Kowalski. As a veteran of the Korean War, Kowalski has seen and done a lot of things he wishes he hadn't. He's bitter, antisocial, and politically incorrect. After his wife's funeral, we discover that he doesn't get along too well with his sons, specifically Mitch (Brian Haley) and his wife, Karen (Geraldine Hughes), who seem to believe that his age automatically makes him codependent and eligible for a spot in a retirement home. His grandchildren don't appreciate him one bit; the granddaughter only wants his stuff, hand-me-downs to take with her to school. They don't make things easy for him, but then again, he doesn't make things easy for them, either. It's a vicious cycle of resentment and miscommunication.As this is being established, we're introduced to a teenage boy named Thao (Bee Vang), who lives next door to Kowalski with his large Hmong family. He's the black sheep of his deeply traditional family, always doing chores that the women are supposed to do. Having no direction in life, he's pressured by his cousin, nicknamed Spider (Doua Moua), to join his neighborhood gang. As an act of initiation, Thao must sneak into Kowalski's garage and steal his most prized possession: A 1972 Gran Torino. The attempt backfires. Some time later, Spider arrives with his posse and tries to abduct Thao. The resulting scuffle is broken up when Kowalski points his shotgun at the gang members and demand they get off his lawn.Within no time at all, Kowalski's front steps are covered with tokens of appreciation from Thao's family, none of which go appreciated. But then Kowalski gets to know Thao's sister, Sue (Ahney Her), a remarkably independent young woman. Quick-witted and outgoing, she takes Kowalski's racial slurs in stride, believing that a good man lies behind the disgruntled faade. As he spends more time with Sue and her family, he begins to realize that he has more in common with them that with his own family, which, in all likelihood, scares him more than it brings him comfort.When Thao formally apologizes for trying to steal Kowalski's Gran Torino, Kowalski puts him to work doing various chores, like repainting a house and fixing gutters. Hardly a scene goes by when he isn't verbally berating Thao, although it's obvious from the start that he's doing it to toughen him up, to make him believe that his life has a purpose and that he should actively be trying to find it. Part of this involves getting Thao to talk like a man. There's a priceless scene in which Kowalski brings Thao to a barber, who has been sharing insults with Kowalski for a number of years. Afterwards, Kowalski arranges for Thao to work at a construction site; the boss, as it turns out, is the perfect man for Thao to test his new vocabulary on. What Kowalski doesn't realize is that he's learning just as much from Thao, especially in matters of caring for other people. Eventually, Kowalski comes to the conclusion that Thao and his family will never be at peace so long as Spider and his gang are around.The film's most fascinating character is Father Janovich (Christopher Carley), a twenty-seven year old priest who promised Kowalski's wife that he'd look after him upon her death and get him to confess. Initially, Kowalski wants nothing to do with Janovich, who gives sermons on matters of life and death yet has no real idea what it means to face your own mortality. Kowalski knows--he served his country in Korea. ""What do you know about life?"" Janovich calmly asks. ""Well,"" says Kowalski, ""I survived the war. I got married and had a family."" There's absolutely no joy in his voice when he says this. Gradually, he begins to appreciate Janovich; he many not have all the answers, but at least he's willing to listen.The brilliance of this movie comes not from the development of the characters, but from the way the characters interact with one another. Virtually no one is on friendly terms at the start, but by the end, there's an understated feeling that respect has been earned on all sides. Kowalski refers to Thao as his friend only once, and while it was nice to actually hear it, it still didn't come as a surprise given everything that had been leading to that moment. At a certain point, you just knew how Kowalski felt. ""Gran Torino"" is such a wonderful film, so carefully structured, so perfectly cast, so rewarding for the audience. To make just one great film in a year is the mark of real talent. But to make two great films in the same year, now that's the work of genius.",5,There's So Much We Can Learn from Each Other,1229385600,"12 16, 2008",2008,5511,"['Can', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'go',

1208828,A18YMFFJW974QS,B001KVZ6ES,CKE,"[4, 5]","There are many things to like about Gran Torino. The thing I appreciate most is its authenticity. There is nothing in ""Gran Torino"" that makes you stop and say ""Now wait a minute - it wouldn't happen that way"". The story takes place in-or-near Detroit - and it is very obvious that it was filmed in the Detroit area.... again everything has a real authentic feal.The story is a coming-to-age story of a man in his ""senior"" years (I know that is a weird way to start an ""coming-to-age"" movie). Eastwood's character is recently widowed retired autoworker who is perpetually unhappy in his bigoted ways. Through a series of events he discovers that he has more respect for his new immigrant neighbors than he does for his own kids. I won't go into too many of the details - but nothing feels contrived or forced in terms of the plot development.""Gran Torino"" is a multi-layered story tale on respect and redemption. The story is very tight and well-written with artistic qualities that are often seen in novels, but rarely in big-budget Hollywood films. While the story is not for everyone (definitely NOT for kids) I think that all of Eastwood's fans will be more than a little satisfied.Final Verdict - ""Gran Torino"" is a great movie, and in many ways it the equal of ""Millionaire Baby"".

You must be confused or uncaring to align Gran Torino with Dirty Harry.Dirty Harry was licensed violence with an unbeatable never say die spirit protecting the American way of life from the underbelly scum of life.Walt Kowalski is a defeated, deformed & hate filled balloon of self-pity hiding behind a mask of uncaring obscenities & the assurance of his own rightness.He's been hurt in a very real manner, by the war, the American society's rejection of him & his buddies, by the ability of those ""gooks"" to follow him across an ocean. He's hurt by the kind of kids his family has grown up to be, by how that growing up dishonors his memory of his wife (the greatest woman in the world).The death of his wife who was the great love of his life & the only love of post Vietnam era life he viewed as the final betrayal of life itself. Other women would be off limits as they couldn't possibly measure up to the best woman in the world.It is what makes his don't come near me behavior completely unbending.Enter Sue Lor: He did his best I'm a foul mouthed, gook hating, no good American war vet act & she: well she wasn't shocked or repulsed or scared. She's just disconcertingly straightforward & quietly persistent. By god, she's a little mystifying. She's, She's sorta like the best woman in the world. It was these qualities that attracted his positive attention & allowed Sue to restore his faith in women along with the Hmong family restoring his faith in society. Remember the line, ""By god I've got more in common with these gooks than I do with my own family.""He says to himself: Self he says (sorry I couldn't stop it), we need to check this out closer. Hope is reborn! He thinks, what she likes will be worthy of liking, what she loves will be worthy of loving & what she dislikes will be dishonorable. He still understands & believes in honor & dishonor. It's the only thing that has kept him from descending to a beast.The Hmong had everything that he wanted in a person, a family & a society except maybe bravery displayed by action. He now has a cause & a purpose. THIS AIN'T DIRTY HARRY. It's Romeo & Juliet without the sex.From my great enemy is sprung my great love. Just because it's a thought from a Vietnam vet about a Hmong family does not reduce the truth & wonder of that statement. Once again, remember the line: ""My god, I've got more in common with these gooks than I do with my own family."" I would add their society also.The most un-Dirty Harry like thing of this show (it's huge) is the fact that it starts with a man that has given up on life. His wife is gone, his kids suck & his health is gone. This isn't the kinda guy that lays in bed waiting for the grim reaper. He is looking for a way to commit suicide without dishonor. If you didn't pick up on the suicide bit early maybe you were Dirty Harry befuddled too. His sacrifice at the end was his honorable cause.The first time he coughs up blood I told my wife, ""He's a suicide looking for a place & a reason to happen."" The only value he had retained at that point was honor so he couldn't sit down & ""eat"" his rifle. Having found another best & honorable woman he felt he could follow her to a suitable cause. His relationship with Thao was instigated by Sue not the attempted theft. He then found his cause through Thao. The giving of his life reflects his rediscovered belief that life is worthwhile & something to die for is good. He had that going to Vietnam & lost it there.Now he is full cycle: From disillusionment & hate back to hope & love.

However Gran Torino completely deserved it, it did however win Eastwood the reviews of his acting career. Both film and performance are consummately sly--coming on with deceptive simplicity, only to evolve into something complex, powerful, and surprisingly tender.Walt Kowalski is a widower, Korean War veteran, retired auto worker, and apparently the last white resident of his side street. He also racist and agressive towards his new Korean neighbours and his pathetic family.As the film advances he starts to change his opinion towards the Koreans next door and develops a friendship between Sue (Ahney Her) and her conflicted brother Thao (Bee Vang). The trajectory of this may surprise you--several times over. Eastwood opted to film in economically blighted Detroit--a shrewd decision, but it's his mapping of Walt's world in that classical style of his that really counts. Every incidental corner of lawn, porch, and basement comes to matter and by all means the workshop/garage that houses the mint-condition Gran Torino which Walt helped build in a more prosperous era.This is by far Clint Eastwood's greatest film.

I am sorry but I would have given this 4 stars if this hadn't one of the most predictable endings in movie history. All I can think is Clint was on meds or people around him were saying it was great. I almost shut it off before the credits.Why would you end a film with such a horrible climax that goes against pretty much what you were trying, or so I thought, to build up the entire film. Sure there was going to be a confrontation. But a whole house of people? Come on man. This is just beyond reality. I was immediately taken out of the film by the end but some of the wooden as hell acting and script surely did not help up to that point. If this is five stars than near anything with a good message is five stars.The gangs are portrayed as a bit too mindless and Clint himself is too gruff and disembodied to suddenly change ways and start loving and caring for these people. THERE IS NO SUBTLY in this film but with a couple of the better scenes.I will say the dinner between Clint and the neighbors was a great scene and made the enormous gap in their relationship seem worth the jump. I like scenes like these in films. But this film has far too few of them. I can't give this any more than 2 stars because quite simply it's not that great even besides the ending. I really thought I was in for a masterpiece here and came away quite disappointed. Clint's output has been quite up and down lately in my mind. Films like Mystic River are much better imo, albeit they have the same tendency to annoy with the ending, and ones like these are mediocre because they do not build properly for one and another because of the quality of the acting and script.Mystic River had a lot of things going for it that this one simply does not. I for one saw the ending in that film to be much more subtle. I wasn't sure of Bacon's plans for Penn's character and to me it was more ambiguous than not. This one is just outright crude. This man has made films as great as The Bridges of Madison County, A Perfect World, and Unforgiven and he has also made entirely overrated stuff like Million Dollar Baby and tripe like Space Cowboys. You never know what you are in for but it seems in his old age he likes those shocking endings. This one is not as bad as Baby but I can't say I enjoyed it that much.

Just when you think the story is edging toward sentimentality, thereis a sudden, shocking twist, one that Kowalski and his surrogate son struggle toovercome.

1208838,A12RMAJXRPQWTY,B001KVZ6ES,C.Wallace,"[3, 5]","Clint Eastwood produced and directed Gran Torino. The character he portrays, Walt Kowalski, worked thirty years for Ford and put the steering column into the titular vehicle. Long retired from the assembly line, his age shows and he sometimes coughs up blood, but he's too tough to admit any frailty.Kowalski is recently widowed and lives alone in a decaying Detroit neighborhood. He's not close to his two sons. They have little patience with the highly-opinionated Kowalski who always bluntly says (growls) exactly what he thinks. It's likely that this abrasiveness alienated his family long ago. His sons seem to dread the prospect of helping their aging father should he become disabled.It turns out that Kowalski is a ""lovable racist,"" an obvious oxymoron which nevertheless portrays his character. He has a fondness for using ethnic slurs in his speech and is not at all shy about using them in front of their targets. He makes his prejudices clear early on and then grinds them into the ground. Enough already. In reality, no one is ever going to shake off the kind of crude remarks Kowalski makes, although in this film people sometimes shrug it all off to the eccentricities of old age.It also turns out that Kowalski is a decorated Korean War veteran with more than a touch of Dirty Harry left in him. His toughness is tested when he befriends his neighbors, Thao (Bee Vang) and Sue (Ahney Her). These are young second generation Hmong immigrants who become the victims of a street gang. Vang and Her are novice actors who shine in these roles. Likely, Eastwood's magic as a director was crucial here.The film builds to a powerful climax. The audience was cheering for the iconic Eastwood. There's talk of Eastwood getting an Oscar for his performance, one of those sentimental ones given to a distinguished actor who somehow has never won. Well, Eastwood's acting in this film merits an Oscar.Kowalski reveals his heart of gold as the film progresses and he grows to appreciate the Hmong culture. This is probably the first time that Hmongs have been featured in a major Hollywood production.In my opinion, if some of the trash talk had been left out along with the totally unconvincing portrayal of a priest by Christopher Carley this film would be a classic.

Walt just wants to be left alone; his idea of happiness is sitting on the porch with a beer and his dog.But that changes when a Hmong gang enters the neighborhood, hell-bent on recruiting the boy next door.  Walt intervenes, and from then on the neighborhood takes a shine to him, whether he wants them to or not.  It is a relationship that will draw Walt out of his shell...with some funny, emotional, and tragic consequences.GRAN TORINO is spectacular.  It is easily Eastwood's finest directorial piece, and I'm willing to go out on a limb and say it features his best performance to boot.  The flaws here are few and far between; the main flaw is that, in his quest for authenticity, Eastwood hired an all-Hmong supporting cast, many of whom aren't professional actors (and you can tell).

There aren't very many emotional punches, thank God, but when they come they are knockouts.

1208842,AQ990HW13DP08,B001KVZ6ES,Daniel B. Clendenin,"[3, 9]","Clint Eastwood directed, produced, and starred as Walt Kowalski in this drama about life and death in a changing America. He's more like his character type than ever before. Kowalski is a snarling Polish racist, bitter retired auto worker, and haunted Korean war veteran who despises the Hmong ""swamp rats"" who've moved into the dilapidated house next door. The film opens with two clashing cultural rituals--the church burial of Kowalski's wife, and the strange Hmong customs that welcome a new baby. The film ends with another funeral that we never expect, this one the result of a deliberately redemptive act. Early on we surmise that the gruff and grumbly Kowalski will be won over by his Hmong neighbors. But there's far more to the film, as Kowalski can't stand idly by and not help the Hmong negotiate their own cultural obstacles, namely, Hmong gang members who try to recruit their son Thao.

1208843,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B001KVZ6ES,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[0, 0]","Gran Torino is outstanding, the best job Eastwood has done to date.This is a very carefully constructed film. Eastwood has to come off as a crotchety old curmudgeon, and that's easy acting for him. Within the first 20 minutes his curmudgeondom is established. The tough part for any film is that transition when the curmudgeon becomes likeable or human. Eastwood did a fabulous job at making that transition perfectly. His motivation for the relationship with his neighbors is 100% completely beleiveable. I bought it, and I've seen hundreds of films where I never bought it. The film easily climbs this hill and then rides down for the next hour to where the film's climax is established. The first indication of film trouble is at the construction office - after Walt and Tao leave the construction office, the camera focuses on the construction boss for about 10 or 15 seconds too long. It's a beat played too long. Eastwood made a few tiny errors at the final transition point, where he turns from the likeable guy with a heart to the vigilanty. The big misstep for me was when Tao comes over to Walt's house and Tao says let's go kill these guys. The dialog didn't work well, there was some odd editing, and the cage thing was just a bit too drawn out. There was symbolism here, that was good, but the pacing / editing was just jarring compared to the rest of the film.The most remarkable part of this film - almost every movie (bar masterpieces) have this very akward time around the midpoint of the film. Gran Torino did not have that problem, Eastwood delayed the strange transition to 7/8 of the way through the movie. An odd choice on his part.Blu-Ray is amazing. The sound effects are so real. Pool balls knocking together in the left rear channel sounded like they were in the house and real. It just goes on and on. Sound was so well done in this film. The images on the other hand were not so special. It was well filmed, but sadly the contrast was a bit flatter than I would have liked.One last bad part, turn off the sound at the last scene. Clint Eastwood performs the theme song and it's awful. No it's just plain pitiful. Don't listen, you will Van Gogh your ears if you do.One other odd piece, the Blu-Ray disc has almost no speical features. What is there, is lame. I mean really lame. Two pieces about the car (who really cares), and a piece about the Eastwood look.

1208845,A1SD82ZAT3INZ2,B001KVZ6ES,Daniel Hayes,"[3, 3]","This is a movie of redemption. Well...perhaps not in the way you think. This is supposedly Eastwood's last movie as far as acting, or so I've heard. He plays a retired auto worker who's bitter at the world a.k.a. Hollywood's latest attempt at portraying the Grumpy Old Man, but this time it's nothing to laugh at. Here you have a man who fought in Korea, and is prejudiced against all Asians. He for the most part doesn't have anything nice to say about anyone. This all changes one night when his prized possession a 1972 Gran Torino is almost stolen by a teenage Asian boy as a initiation to join a gang. Well it backfires, and the boy is almost killed by Walt(Eastwood's character). It's at this point that Walt's and the boy Tao's paths cross as Tao's family makes him go over to apologize to Walt, and offers Tao to help out Walt. Walt's heart is softened somewhat, and he becomes friendly with Tao's family, and breaks bread with them. He also protects them well the big sister as the gangs in Detroit where Walt lives take a shine to her....Not. Anyway Walt takes Tao under his wing(In his own way), and helps him to come out of his shell. Then the real test comes when Tao's sister is assaulted, and Walt takes matters into his own hands so to speak. Surprisingly he does it up as a way to pay back the Asians he murdered in war while in Korea. He goes out, and gets a fitted suit, makes amendments to his will, and does something his dead wife wanted him to do, and that was to make confession of all his sins. He confronts the teenage Asians with the assumption to kill them all, but imagine that he allows the gang to kill him. This is redemption in action which is how I guess some men try to make amends for not showing love to one another because of male pride, and so forth. Tao in fact gets the closest to an apology from Walt as Tao assumes that he's going along with Walt to confront the gang, and Walt tells Tao that he (Walt) has blood on his hands, and that he doesn't want that for Tao. Not to mention that to the surprise of his family...especially his eldest granddaughter that the Gran Torino goes to Tao. This was a decent outing for Eastwood, but not quite the classics of ""Play Misty For Me"", or ""Heartbreak Ridge"". This movie did speak to me however as the scene where Tao goes into the barber shop with Walt, and Walt starts spewing slurs left and right, and then Tao trying to emulate Walt does the same thing, but ends up insulting the guy. This is where we as men have to be careful because we as children want to be modeled after our fathers. I know that one time I heard my father slur a race, and when I said something similar I was told to:""Shut Up."" I still don't understand if he didn't want me to utter the slur then why did he do it in front of me? This is not a movie for those who are offended by racial slurs, and downright raunchy language.

1208846,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,B001KVZ6ES,Dave. K,"[3, 3]","GRAN TORINO***** Out of 5Release Date- December 12th, 2008Running Time- 116-MinutesRating- RScreenplay- Nick SchenkDirector- Clint EastwoodStarring- Clint Eastwood, Bee Vang, Ahney Her, Christopher Carley2008 was a great year in the legendary career of Clint Eastwood as he delivered two of the best films of his career with Changeling and Gran Torino; both of these movies were two of the very best of 2008 and I fail to understand how neither of these movies received a best picture nomination or best director. If Gran Torino is Eastwood's last acting gig he sure as hell went out with a bang with what just might be the best performance of his career.Gran Torino is vintage Eastwood he's made a career playing the tough guy and he is the last of the ultimate film tough guys with Bronson and McQueen no longer with us. Even in his late 70s Clint can still pull the tough guy role off to perfection; Think of Clint's character as maybe an older Dirty Harry in terms of the tough guy persona. Again even at his age you never doubt that he's still the ultimate tough guy. And again this is vintage Eastwood.Gran Torino gets off to a solid start, but there isn't anything that really stands out, but as the movie goes on it simply gets better and better and by the end of the movie I was blown away by how amazing of a movie this was and it had me in awe. Gran Torino is an instant classic and one of the best movies in Clint Eastwood's career both as an actor and as a director.The screenplay by Nick Schenk was slightly clich&eacute;d in some spots, but overall it worked well with some truly great characters that are also very well developed, which is something rare these days in Hollywood. Gran Torino may not have the perfect screenplay, but it's a very good one. The dramatic scenes play out well and there is also some comedy and both these elements really work very well. Like I said the characters are fleshed out and developed and all the main characters will get a reaction from the viewer. So even if Gran Torino is slightly clich&eacute;d in spots, Nick Schenk makes up for it with some truly great characters.As director Clint Eastwood knocks it out of the park with a truly gripping and touching movie. At first I wasn't really a big fan of Eastwood's direction. I never felt he was a poor director well outside of maybe The Rookie, which was a bit poor. But I never felt he was a bad director, but I never really got into his direction. But over the years I have found a new appreciation for Eastwood as a director and he's by far one of my favorite directors now. What makes Eastwood such a great filmmaker is his simplicity, which can sometimes bring a filmmaker down, but Clint doesn't try and be flashy and simply tells the story.Gran Torino again was truly gripping and touching; Eastwood hits all the right spots in terms of drama and comedy and really brings you into this world and makes you care for the characters. The action sequences are brief, but all pack a punch and aren't overdone, but done in a simple way that makes them all the more powerful. It seems like the Academy always nominates Eastwood every chance they get, but why he was snubbed for Gran Torino and Changeling is beyond me. Gran Torino is everything it's been made out to be and more. As filmmakers get older normally they don't get better. But Clint is just as great now as he ever was and maybe in some ways better.About the only real flaw one can find with Gran Torino is possibly the acting. While none of the performances are terrible, but some are a bit wooden. Clint Eastwood is a great actor, but he doesn't have a lot of range. He pretty much plays a variation of the same character for the most part and by no means is that an insult. Eastwood is possibly the best at the role he plays. Outside of Bronson and McQueen nobody can play the tough guy like Eastwood and I'd say he's a better actor than Bronson, but sorry I'd have to give McQueen the edge. But while Clint may not have the most range he's still a fantastic actor, but here with Gran Torino his performance was mind blowing. In terms of acting I think Unforgiven and Gran Torino were his two best as far as range goes. As Walt Kowalski, Eastwood is funny, sympathetic and very likeable. Eastwood shows a great deal of range and I truly believe an Oscar nomination should have come his way.Making their film debuts are Bee Vang as Thao and Ahney Her as Sue and both actors show some potential. Bee Vang does well and while his performance is by no means perfect and a little rough around the edges in some spots, but he handles it well and his character was likeable. Again it was his film debut so you cannot expect perfection, but overall he does well even if a little stiff at times, but since the character was likeable I'll give him the passing grade. Ahney Her however steals the show with a really great and energetic performance and what she has going for her is charisma. Each scene Ahney was in she really lit up the screen and brought a lot of fun to the character.Gran Torino was no doubt one of the best movies of 2008 and Eastwood's performance is one of the best if not the best of his career. Despite some clich&eacute;s Gran Torino works on every level and is a must see for all Eastwood fans.The Blu-ray release for Gran Torino was simply just ok; the picture quality is excellent and no complaints there; the sound was alright, but nothing really special. The features though are quite weak the Blu-ray has an exclusive feature about the making of the movie, which was pretty cool, but such a great movie and such a poor release just isn't right.",5,When

1208847,A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY,B001KVZ6ES,"David A. Dein ""passafist""","[21, 23]","I hope that in 30 years someone decides to remake Gran Torino. Hopefully it will be a shot-by-shot remake like 1998's Psycho, or maybe someone tries to do a direct homage to it, or maybe a Japanese remake or didn't they make a Turkish version of Star Wars? I really don't care how they remake it. I just want to prove how masterfully Eastwood breathes life into a story that in wrong hands could be a melodramatic mess, or a bad Sitcom.Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) is a guy missing his decade, he still lives in the home he raised his family in, even though the rest of the neighborhood disappeared years ago. His home is still painted while the homes around him fall apart. The post-war suburban paradise that once was is long gone replaced by gangs, crime, and the Hmong immigrants who have replaced his former white-bread neighbors.Kowalski has lived a life of hard work and maybe a little regret. He's a decorated Korean War Vet, a husband who's just buried his wife, and a father that has lost touch with his sons. Don't get him started on his bratty Grandkids who want him to die so they get his stuff including a sweet 1972 Gran Torino. Kowalski is a man who poured his heart and soul into a country who doesn't need him anymore and a family that is ready to send him off to Boca to die. Everything changes when he catches his neighbor trying to steal his Gran Torino, and he is introduced into a world that just might let him get the redemption he so desperately needs.Eastwood has crafted a beautiful film that is honest. With an approach that is so matter of fact and never over sentimental. In the wrong hands this could translate as boring. Yet Eastwood finds a way to make the film real without boring us. It's funny when it needs to be funny, gripping when it needs to grip, and emotional without being overtly emotional. Kowalski exists in the real world, he's abrasive, he's angry, he drinks, smokes, chews tobacco and has lived long enough to not have that politically correct filter that everyone in my generation was issued at birth. He built the world with his bare hands and wishes that people we're polite, kids respected their elders, and is tired of taking crap from everyone. But it's not because he's a monster and Eastwood instills a warmth in Kowalski that drives the film forward.The supporting cast works because they are real kids. Newcomer Ahney Her deserves notice as Sue, a smart plucky kid that Kowalski aids and Bee Vang hits the right marks as Thao, Sue's brother who Kowalski takes under his wing. Eastwood doesn't ask for gut-wrenching performances from these two kids, only honesty and that's why they work. When the climax hits it's apex Eastwood doesn't ask his cast to react as characters in a movie, but as regular kids.Gran Torino is not what I expected, it's not Dirty Harry meets Grumpy Old Men. It's a powerful film that sneaks up on you and pulls you along. At any moment it could have been shallow, at any moment it could have been melodramatic, and at any moment we could have hated Kowalski. Trust me there is plenty not to like about this guy, but Eastwood shows us his frustrations, and emotions not by acting them out, but by being real and by giving Kowalski a warmth we don't expect.Gran Torino makes me wish I had treasured the moments I could have had with my Grandfather. It also challenges me to reach out even If I don't want to. Gran Torino is not about telling a fake story about redemption, it's about real people with real problems and how they find within themselves the power to take responsibility for their lives and in that they find the strength to overcome what life has dealt them. Gran Torino will not change the world but it may make you look at your fellow man with a little more compassion.",5,Amazing,1233446400,"02 1, 2009",2009,3764,"['hope', '30', 'years', 'someone', 'remake', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'be', 'shot-by-shot', 'remake', '1998', 'Psycho', 'maybe', 'someone', 'tries', 'do', 'direct', 'homage', 'maybe', 'Japanese', 'remake', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'Turkish', 'version', 'Star', 'Wars', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'how', 'remake', 'just', 'want', 'prove', 'how', 'masterfully', 'Eastwood', 'breathes', 'life', 'story', 'wrong', 'hands', 'could', 'be', 'melodramatic', 'mess', 'bad', 'Sitcom.Walt', 'Kowalski', 'Eastwood', 'guy', 'missing', 'decade', 'still', 'home', 'raised', 'family', 'even', 'rest', 'neighborhood', 'disappeared', 'years', 'ago', 'home', 'still', 'painted', 'homes', 'fall', 'apart', 'post-war', 'suburban', 'paradise', 'once', 'was', 'long', 'gone', 'replaced', 'gangs', 'crime', 'Hmong', 'immigrants', 'who', 'have', 'replaced', 'former', 'white-bread', 'neighbors.Kowalski', 'lived', 'life', 'hard', 'work', 'maybe', 'little', 'regret', 'decorated', 'Korean', 'War', 'Vet', 'husband', 'who', 'just', 'buried', 'wife', 'father', 'lost', 'touch', 'sons', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'started', 'bratty', 'Grandkids', 'who', 'want', 'die', 'so', 'get', 'stuff', 'including', 'sweet', '1972', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'Kowalski', 'man', 'who', 'poured', 'heart', 'soul', 'country', 'who', ""n't"", 'need', 'anymore', 'family', 'ready', 'send', 'off', 'Boca', 'die', 'Everything', 'changes', 'when', 'neighbor', 'trying', 'steal', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'introduced', 'world', 'just', 'might', 'let', 'get', 'redemption', 'so', 'desperately', 'needs.Eastwood', 'crafted', 'beautiful', 'film', 'honest', 'approach', 'so', 'matter', 'fact', 'never', 'sentimental', 'wrong', 'hands', 'could', 'translate', 'boring', 'Eastwood', 'way', 'make', 'film', 'real', 'boring', 'funny', 'when', 'be', 'funny', 'gripping', 'when', 'grip', 'emotional', 'being', 'overtly', 'emotional', 'Kowalski', 'real', 'world', 'abrasive', 'angry', 'smokes', 'chews', 'tobacco', 'lived', 'long', 'enough', 'not', 'have', 'politically', 'correct', 'filter', 'everyone', 'generation', 'was', 'issued', 'birth', 'built', 'world', 'bare', 'hands', 'wishes', 'people', ""'re"", 'polite', 'kids', 'respected', 'elders', 'tired', 'taking', 'crap', 'everyone', 'not', 'monster', 'Eastwood', 'warmth', 'Kowalski', 'film', 'forward.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'works', 'are', 'real', 'kids', 'Newcomer', 'Ahney', 'Her', 'notice', 'Sue', 'smart', 'plucky', 'kid', 'Kowalski', 'aids', 'Bee', 'Vang', 'right', 'marks', 'Thao', 'Sue', 'brother', 'who', 'Kowalski', 'wing', 'Eastwood', ""n't"", 'ask', 'gut-wrenching', 'performances', 'two', 'kids', 'only', 'honesty', 'why', 'work', 'When', 'climax', 'apex', 'Eastwood', ""n't"", 'ask', 'cast', 'react', 'characters', 'movie', 'regular', 'kids.Gran', 'Torino', 'not', 'what', 'expected', 'not', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'Grumpy', 'Old', 'Men', 'powerful', 'film', 'up', 'pulls', 'along', 'moment', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'shallow', 'moment', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'melodramatic', 'moment', 'could', 'have', 'hated', 'Kowalski', 'Trust', 'plenty', 'not', 'like', 'guy', 'Eastwood', 'frustrations', 'emotions', 'not', 'acting', 'out', 'being', 'real', 'giving', 'Kowalski', 'warmth', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect.Gran', 'Torino', 'wish', 'had', 'treasured', 'moments', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'Grandfather', 'also', 'reach', 'out', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'not', 'telling', 'fake', 'story', 'redemption', 'real', 'people', 'real', 'problems', 'how', 'find', 'power', 'take', 'responsibility', 'lives', 'find', 'strength', 'overcome', 'what', 'life', 'dealt', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'will', 'not', 'change', 'world', 'may', 'make', 'look', 'fellow', 'man', 'little', 'more', 'compassion']",Gran Torino
1208848,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B001KVZ6ES,David Baldwin,"[4, 4]","In what promises to be Clint Eastwood's valedictory role as an actor he once again reimagines the Man With No Name-Dirty Harry persona so that's so burnished in our collective psyche.  Walt Kowalski(Eastwood) is a retired Ford worker who can be best described as grizzled, profane, and just a little bit Archie Bunker-ish in his worldview.  Not the least bit misanthropic he feels more of a connection to his '72 Gran Torino than he does his own family.  Dig a little deeper, though, you find a man bearing the scars of his service in the Korean conflict.  Walt has an ingrained perception of the American dream but finds that being challenged by the changing face of his Detroit neighborhood particularly his reaction to the Hmong family who live next door to him.  Through a series of events, though, Walt developes a connection daresay a deep-rooted respect for the Hmong. Walt also feels, even in his dotage, the obligation to serve as protector to this family in an ever increasing hostile environment.  I harken back to ""Unforgiven"" when Eastwood re-evaluated his Western persona.  Here, Eastwood does a re-examination of his more reactionary film characters.  This film was cleverly advertised by it's makers as a geriatric action extravaganza.  For sure justice is meted out in the end but not remotely in a way you would think.

1208849,A2KWG1J285Z4QA,B001KVZ6ES,David Baltazar,"[4, 4]","This review is for;Gran Torino (Widescreen Edition)As a life long Clint Eastwood fan watching ""Gran Torino"" stirred up memories of Dirty Harry, Sgt Gunney Highway from ""Heartbreak Ridge"" and any other similar characters that Clint has done throughout his illustrious career in his iconic, ""Eastwood"" style. A style complete with his trademark raspy voice, angry-eyed stares & straight to the point, but sometimes humourous dialouge.  Set in a Detroit neighborhood we learn that Eastwood's character Walt Kwolski has just become a widow. A decorated veteran of the Korean War he has two sons, but he isn't close to them nor their families. His grand-daughter talks to him about what is going to happen to his possessions when he is going to die. His son & daughter-in-law talks to him about going to a retirement home. He also hates the Toyota SUV his son is driving as we learn Walt used to work at the Ford factory. ""Buy American"" he curses! I'm not from Detroit, but I heard import cars are sometimes frowned upon there since American cars are produced by the big three American manufacturers in Detroit.With the look of frustration he continues to live alone with his dog. He has immigrant neighbors that he initially despises, but ultimately gets drawn to them after a local gang encounter with the family's son Thao. The same son that attempts to steal Walt's prized 72 Gran Torino from Walt's garage but fails. Walt becomes a neighborhood hero and is showered with gifts of plants or food by his neighbors that he initially refuses. Thao's sister Sue, befriends Walt and he returns the favor by rescuing her from three men who threaten her & her very, scarred boyfriend. However the very shy & reclusive Thao becomes the interim student for Walt, as Walt sort of takes him under his wing and attempts to make him more of a man by teaching him. His dialogue lesson in the barber shop is one of the greatest and funniest moments in the film, which helps him immensely for his next encounter during the construction job interview. Walt still periodically communicates with his son's family with little or no success (his son's attempt to give his father birthday presents were funny to watch!), but it is the immigrant family that Walt really bonds with in this film as they are the true focal point for Walt. We also learn of Walt's impending sickness that may very well influence him for what he decides to do in the end.This is a coming of age film for the character Thao and a redemption story for Walt who despite his severed relationship with his sons & their families finds solace with another family he initially despises but learns to trust & love towards the end. There are many racial slurs spoken throughout the film as well as profanity, but the kind of language you might hear from street gangs anyways. Actually, every time Eastwood spoke with profanity, he always made it sound funny! The film climaxes to the eventual final confrontation with Walt & the terrorizing gang. Without revealing what really happens in the end, the results were satisfactory. This is another great Eastwood film that goes up there with ""Unforgiven"" & ""Million Dollar Baby"". Although I think ""Gran Torino"" should satisfy more of the Eastwood fans that enjoyed the type of character Eastwood portrays from his Dirty Harry movie series or a similar character from ""Heartbreak Ridge"". Classic Eastwood at his best!Oh yeah & the next time someone gets on my front yard, I will give them the iconic Eastwood stare & say ""Get Off my Lawn!"".",5,What if Dirty Harry Lived Next Door to You?,1248739200,"07 28, 2009",2009,3530,"['review', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'life', 'long', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'fan', 'watching', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'stirred', 'up', 'memories', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'Sgt', 'Gunney', 'Highway', 'Heartbreak', 'Ridge', 'other', 'similar', 'characters', 'Clint', 'done', 'illustrious', 'career', 'iconic', 'Eastwood', 'style', 'style', 'complete', 'trademark', 'raspy', 'voice', 'angry-eyed', 'stares', 'straight', 'point', 'sometimes', 'humourous', 'dialouge', 'Set', 'Detroit', 'neighborhood', 'learn', 'Eastwood', 'character', 'Walt', 'Kwolski', 'just', 'become', 'widow', 'decorated', 'veteran', 'Korean', 'War', 'two', 'sons', ""n't"", 'close', 'families', 'grand-daughter', 'talks', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'possessions', 'when', 'going', 'die', 'son', 'daughter-in-law', 'talks', 'about', 'going', 'retirement', 'home', 'also', 'Toyota', 'SUV', 'son', 'driving', 'learn', 'Walt', 'used', 'work', 'Ford', 'factory', 'Buy', 'American', ""'m"", 'not', 'Detroit', 'heard', 'import', 'cars', 'are', 'sometimes', 'frowned', 'there', 'American', 'cars', 'are', 'produced', 'big', 'three', 'American', 'manufacturers', 'Detroit.With', 'look', 'frustration', 'live', 'alone', 'dog', 'immigrant', 'neighbors', 'initially', 'ultimately', 'drawn', 'local', 'gang', 'encounter', 'family', 'son', 'Thao', 'same', 'son', 'steal', 'Walt', 'prized', '72', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'Walt', 'garage', 'fails', 'Walt', 'neighborhood', 'hero', 'showered', 'gifts', 'plants', 'food', 'neighbors', 'initially', 'Thao', 'sister', 'Sue', 'Walt', 'favor', 'rescuing', 'three', 'men', 'who', 'threaten', 'very', 'scarred', 'boyfriend', 'However', 'very', 'shy', 'reclusive', 'Thao', 'interim', 'student', 'Walt', 'Walt', 'sort', 'wing', 'attempts', 'make', 'more', 'man', 'teaching', 'dialogue', 'lesson', 'barber', 'shop', 'one', 'greatest', 'funniest', 'moments', 'film', 'immensely', 'next', 'encounter', 'construction', 'job', 'interview', 'Walt', 'still', 'periodically', 'son', 'family', 'little', 'success', 'son', 'attempt', 'give', 'father', 'birthday', 'presents', 'were', 'funny', 'watch', 'immigrant', 'family', 'Walt', 'really', 'bonds', 'film', 'are', 'true', 'focal', 'point', 'Walt', 'also', 'learn', 'Walt', 'impending', 'sickness', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'influence', 'what', 'do', 'end.This', 'coming', 'age', 'film', 'character', 'Thao', 'redemption', 'story', 'Walt', 'who', 'severed', 'relationship', 'sons', 'families', 'solace', 'family', 'initially', 'trust', 'love', 'end', 'are', 'many', 'racial', 'slurs', 'spoken', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'profanity', 'kind', 'language', 'might', 'hear', 'street', 'gangs', 'anyways', 'Actually', 'time', 'Eastwood', 'spoke', 'profanity', 'always', 'made', 'sound', 'funny', 'film', 'climaxes', 'eventual', 'final', 'confrontation', 'Walt', 'terrorizing', 'gang', 'revealing', 'what', 'really', 'end', 'results', 'were', 'satisfactory', 'great', 'Eastwood', 'film', 'there', 'Unforgiven', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'think', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'should', 'satisfy', 'more', 'Eastwood', 'fans', 'enjoyed', 'type', 'character', 'Eastwood', 'portrays', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'movie', 'series', 'similar', 'character', 'Heartbreak', 'Ridge', 'Classic', 'Eastwood', 'best', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'next', 'time', 'someone', 'front', 'yard', 'will', 'give', 'iconic', 'Eastwood', 'stare', 'say', 'Get', 'Off', 'Lawn']",Gran Torino

Although its overall story arc of a bigot's change for the better (which permits him to perform a redemptive act) is genuinely moving and although there are at least a dozen excellent scenes (some touching, some humorous) showing him interacting with a pair of young Hmong neighbors (a brother and sister duo), this film also struck me as having lots of weak, flabby passages in its script.  Many repetitious and implausible scenes involving a stereotypically wet-behind-the-ears priest, an array of moronic, inept gang members, and the excessively obnoxious grandchildren of Eastwood's character should have ended up on the cutting-room floor. Similarly, many contrasting scenes affirming the overall wonderfulness of the refugee families are excessive and equally implausible.Many DVDs contain ""deleted scenes"" with a director's commentary explaining why they were cut. This DVD has no such extra feature; instead, it appears that everything scripted was filmed, and everything filmed was included--which is unfortunate.As a grumpy-old-racist-with-a-heart-of-gold, C.E. does a good job, and the issue of RACISM IN AMERICA is dealt with in a way that will (or should) make many viewers reconsider their own mindsets.

This is in keeping with the main character.  Black tones are deep, providing good contrast.  A number of indoor scenes appear to have been shot in natural light, which adds to the realism.

1208861,A2PZ1W2Q4JQQWA,B001KVZ6ES,"Devon Christopher Adams ""www.nooccar.com""","[4, 6]","Been seeing previews for Gran Torino and it looked like a cross between Million Dollar Baby and Dirty Harry. The early trailers weren't doing much for me, but then the secondary trailers had some nice plot development and intrigue. I was more interested in catching MILK or The Reader today, but something drew me to this movie. And you know what that was? It was the BEST MOVIE OF 2008.Yes, I declared this now. The nominees aren't out yet even, and I am usually more reserved in my reviews. I just can't be that reserved here. I literally walked out of the film and wanted to sit in the car and sob. Sob like a little baby.We know Eastwood is good. He's always been good, although his gravely voice was off putting (much like Bale's in another much hyped film). In this film Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski, a Korean war veteran, who's stuck in back a 1/2 century. His wife recently died, his self-absorbed sons and grand children just suck, and the catholic priest is played by a boy (Christopher Carley) who looks like he just got his driver's license, although through his tenacity the audience can't help but want to pinch his cheeks by the second hour in. Eastwood's gravely snarl is punctuated by the Hmong people who've overtaken most of his Detroit suburb. Ever Asian racial slur you could imagine is used by Eastwood in this film and the man sitting next to me scoffing at everyone one were both quite bothersome. It felt overdone to a fault (no I do not hear people actually talk like this anywhere.)Eastwood saves the life of Thao (Bee Vang) from a local gang and begins to teach the boy to be a man. Thao bugs the hell out of me, not because he's a ""wimp"" so much than his mannerisms, haircut (which he could've easily changed in a hilarious barber shop scene!), and fact that his true transformation never really comes to fruition except at the very end of the film (and that's even a week show of it).I understand this is an Eastwood vehicle all around (included his real life sons), but , for me, Thao's sister, Sue, stole the show! Introduced as the youngest in a house of women and the older, bossy (well meaning) sister of Thao, Sue is the vehicle who brings the racist and reluctant Walt into the Hmong culture, her home and her people. Ahney Her playing Sue has never acted before, but I was surprised at how refreshingly she holds her own through her seamless banter with one of the most talented actors of his generation. Typically, I am writing these reviews after nominations have been released, and I have no idea if Her will even receive a nod, but here I assert she deserves the nod. Now, for some, being nominated (especially in a first role), is the reward itself, and we both know that Her'll be up against some talented and experienced actresses. If nominated, I fear she will not win.Spoilers below....Now earlier I mentioned that I sobbed in the end. True. Totally true. This hardass who beats a Hmong gang member, shoves his fists through glass windows, and pokes guns at asians and blacks alike, would be expected to seek out retribution in the same manner as he lived his life through the film. This wasn't true. This isn't how it ended. He made a decision for his new family and friends, made good with his dead wife and her priest, and found peace in salvation through his sacrifice of himself for Thao & Sue.The `72 Gran Torino that Eastwood never drives in the film weaves itself through the narrative as a harken back to a time when Walt worked for Ford (and put the drive shaft in on the line himself), an american car company, when his wife was alive and his sons weren't as self-absorbed as they've become. Back to a time before when American was ""American"". As Walt progressed, developed, and opened himself to Thao, Sue, and his neighbors, the Gran Torino became a symbols of manhood of Thao (who was given permission to take it for his first date) ad a rite of passage for him, as he is given this car, by Walt, in his will at the resolution of the film.Sue's simple survival of the rape and beating, Thao's slow progression to manhood and succession, the priest's realization of what living and dying really means, brings together a neighborhood, a people, and everything that Walt once felt stratified his neighborhood and his contemporary and disgusting life. A life that he finally lived for those around him, who he came to love.",5,Best film of 2008,1232150400,"01 17, 2009",2009,4380,"['Been', 'seeing', 'previews', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'looked', 'cross', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'early', 'trailers', 'were', ""n't"", 'doing', 'much', 'then', 'secondary', 'trailers', 'had', 'nice', 'plot', 'development', 'intrigue', 'was', 'more', 'interested', 'catching', 'MILK', 'Reader', 'today', 'something', 'drew', 'movie', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'was', 'BEST', 'MOVIE', 'OF', '2008.Yes', 'declared', 'now', 'nominees', 'are', ""n't"", 'out', 'yet', 'even', 'am', 'usually', 'more', 'reserved', 'reviews', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'reserved', 'here', 'literally', 'walked', 'film', 'wanted', 'sit', 'car', 'sob', 'Sob', 'little', 'baby.We', 'know', 'Eastwood', 'good', 'always', 'been', 'good', 'gravely', 'voice', 'was', 'putting', 'much', 'Bale', 'much', 'hyped', 'film', 'film', 'Eastwood', 'Walt', 'Kowalski', 'Korean', 'war', 'veteran', 'who', 'stuck', 'back', '1/2', 'century', 'wife', 'recently', 'died', 'self-absorbed', 'sons', 'grand', 'children', 'just', 'suck', 'catholic', 'priest', 'played', 'boy', 'Christopher', 'Carley', 'who', 'just', 'got', 'driver', 'license', 'tenacity', 'audience', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'want', 'pinch', 'cheeks', 'second', 'hour', 'Eastwood', 'gravely', 'snarl', 'punctuated', 'Hmong', 'people', 'who', ""'ve"", 'overtaken', 'most', 'Detroit', 'suburb', 'Ever', 'Asian', 'racial', 'slur', 'could', 'imagine', 'used', 'Eastwood', 'film', 'man', 'sitting', 'next', 'scoffing', 'everyone', 'one', 'were', 'quite', 'bothersome', 'felt', 'overdone', 'fault', 'do', 'not', 'hear', 'people', 'actually', 'talk', 'anywhere', 'Eastwood', 'life', 'Thao', 'Bee', 'Vang', 'local', 'gang', 'teach', 'boy', 'be', 'man', 'Thao', 'bugs', 'hell', 'not', 'wimp', 'so', 'much', 'mannerisms', 'haircut', 'could', ""'ve"", 'easily', 'changed', 'hilarious', 'barber', 'shop', 'scene', 'fact', 'true', 'transformation', 'never', 'really', 'fruition', 'very', 'end', 'film', 'even', 'week', 'show', 'understand', 'Eastwood', 'vehicle', 'included', 'real', 'life', 'sons', 'Thao', 'sister', 'Sue', 'stole', 'show', 'Introduced', 'youngest', 'house', 'women', 'older', 'bossy', 'well', 'meaning', 'sister', 'Thao', 'Sue', 'vehicle', 'who', 'racist', 'reluctant', 'Walt', 'Hmong', 'culture', 'home', 'people', 'Ahney', 'Her', 'playing', 'Sue', 'never', 'acted', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'refreshingly', 'own', 'seamless', 'banter', 'one', 'most', 'talented', 'actors', 'generation', 'Typically', 'am', 'writing', 'reviews', 'nominations', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'have', 'idea', 'will', 'even', 'receive', 'nod', 'here', 'assert', 'nod', 'Now', 'being', 'nominated', 'especially', 'first', 'role', 'reward', 'know', ""'ll"", 'be', 'up', 'talented', 'experienced', 'actresses', 'nominated', 'fear', 'will', 'not', 'win.Spoilers', '.Now', 'earlier', 'mentioned', 'sobbed', 'end', 'True', 'Totally', 'true', 'hardass', 'who', 'Hmong', 'gang', 'member', 'fists', 'glass', 'windows', 'guns', 'asians', 'blacks', 'alike', 'would', 'be', 'expected', 'seek', 'out', 'retribution', 'same', 'manner', 'lived', 'life', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'true', ""n't"", 'how', 'ended', 'made', 'decision', 'new', 'family', 'friends', 'made', 'good', 'dead', 'wife', 'priest', 'found', 'peace', 'salvation', 'sacrifice', 'Thao', 'Sue.The', '72', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'Eastwood', 'never', 'film', 'narrative', 'harken', 'back', 'time', 'when', 'Walt', 'worked', 'Ford', 'put', 'drive', 'shaft', 'line', 'american', 'car', 'company', 'when', 'wife', 'was', 'alive', 'sons', 'were', ""n't"", 'as', 'self-absorbed', ""'ve"", 'become', 'Back', 'time', 'when', 'American', 'was', 'American', 'Walt', 'progressed', 'developed', 'opened', 'Thao', 'Sue', 'neighbors', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'became', 'symbols', 'manhood', 'Thao', 'who', 'was', 'given', 'permission', 'take', 'first', 'date', 'ad', 'rite', 'passage', 'given', 'car', 'Walt', 'will', 'resolution', 'film.Sue', 'simple', 'survival', 'rape', 'beating', 'Thao', 'slow', 'progression', 'manhood', 'succession', 'priest', 'realization', 'what', 'living', 'dying', 'really', 'together', 'neighborhood', 'people', 'everything', 'Walt', 'once', 'felt', 'stratified', 'neighborhood', 'contemporary', 'disgusting', 'life', 'life', 'finally', 'lived', 'who', 'came', 'love']",Gran Torino
1208862,A2IHIKHWCDB0FG,B001KVZ6ES,Dexter Manning,"[2, 5]","Clint Eastwood's second directorial endeavor of 2007--the second of the fall season, in fact--""Gran Torino,"" is quite different from the previous movie, ""Changeling,"" in a number of ways (unlike in 2006, the last time he had two films in a single season, in which both naturally complemented each other: ""Flags of Our Fathers"" and ""Letters from Iwo Jima"").The previous film was set in a 1920s-era Los Angeles that, in its physical appearance, seemed picture-perfect; the current movie uses an aging, gritty, modern-day Detroit as its backdrop. Although he did not appear on-screen in ""Changeling,"" he returns as a hero in ""Torino,"" albeit an imperfect one. The main protagonists of both films are searching: Angelina Jolie's main mission in ""Changeling"" is to find her missing son; actor Eastwood's main goal, though not explicitly stated, is to find redemption for an old guilt that haunts him.Where Jolie's character, Christine Collins, is shown to be beautiful and virtually flawless, saintly to the point where it almost works against the character and her picture, Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski, whose racial prejudice and male chauvinism are thinly veiled beneath his weathered skin and often seep through his contemptuous grimace--and his character and his picture are better for this plain honesty, this flaw that, as the film progresses, he finds himself successfully overcoming, though he never makes it an actual goal to do so. It just happens--and convincingly so.At the start of the movie, Kowalski is an old-time veteran of the Korean war, has just lost his beloved wife and has little left except his dog Daisy, a big, immaculately-maintained--and utterly empty--house and a lifetime of bitterness. The only thing he nurtures, it seems, is his contempt for the Koreans who, over time, have become the dominant majority in his decaying neighborhood, especially those who just moved into the house next door.The story is also about those Koreans next door, in particular the shy teenage boy Thao Vang Lor (Bee Vang), who is intelligent and content to do chores around the house he shares with his older sister, Sue (Ahney Her), and their family, such as gardening, washing the dishes and other tasks considered by most others he knows as ""women's work."" That combination of meekness, academic smarts and tidiness give others, in particular his cousin and his brutal gang, a reason, in their own minds, to ridicule Thao as weak and to recruit him into their ranks, which they do repeatedly and aggressively enough that he finally joins them, albeit reluctantly.His first assignment is one that will inadvertently bring him and his neighbor closer together, though unwittingly. To pass his initiation, he must steal Kowalski's Gran Torino, a vintage 1970s sports car with sleek lines and a cool metal sheen, kept in mint condition by its owner, who seems to love it more than anything, in part because he worked, for many years, on the assembly line that built the model.After Kowalski's confrontations foil the gang's and assorted other thugs' malevolence directed toward Thao and Sue, he becomes, in Sue's words, ""a hero to the neighborhood"" and, before long, he is lavishly bestowed with gifts of food--a custom that arrived with the immigrants to the area--and invited to a huge feast at the Lor's home, attended by their extended family. It's terribly difficult, of course to continue to hate people when they treat one with such kindness, so it is not a surprise that these two cultures of people become something of a family. The majority of the film's middle is about how Kowalski warms to the Lors, gradually learns of Korean culture (mostly by a humorous trial and error), protects Sue and Thao almost as if they were of his own blood, and, in particular, becomes Thao's guide and mentor, with a ""tough-love"" approach in an almost surrogate-father relationship. Really, it's about how a man who seemed to have lost the capacity to love, learns to love people again.The last section, consisting chiefly of a final showdown between Kowalski and the Korean thugs who have set their sights on Thao, is not as interesting as the rest of the story, as we all know that, like good against bad in westerns, it is bound to happen. Nevertheless, it plays out in a way that we may not expect, is suspenseful and caps a film in which much actually happens, not always in terms of action but in human relations.It is that stylistically simple, unvarnished focus on people and their friendships they find in those they didn't expect that makes this film more personal than some of Eastwood's other directorial offerings--""Changeling,"" for example. There is sincere slice-of-life quality that is by turns dramatic and humorous, though never inappropriately so. It is a compliment that this picture, in its appearance and feel, is simple and rather nuanced, lacking the higher-concept style of most Hollywood movies that deal with similar issues, including many of Eastwood's own. High-tension fights which, in other films, might be allowed a more aesthetically extravagant depiction are, here, more subdued (though there is a scene that may remind some of Eastwood's over-the-top 1970s-era action film ""The Gauntlet,"" but only in the vaguest sense). Even the gang members generally look like average people, save for their behavior, and not over-stylized, super-hyper, muscular beasts as some other movies would easily render them.Vang and Her give capable, if somewhat nondescript, performances as the brother and sister Kowalski takes under his wing, and there is a memorable relationship between the cranky and militant senior citizen and Father Janovich (Christopher Carley), a boyishly young priest ardent on obtaining a confession from his skeptical parishioner, as was his wife's wish, and who questions the old man's methods of handling the trouble imposed by the gangs. But, the stand-out performance is Eastwood's own, frequently portraying Kowalski as old, curmudgeonly and stubborn, yes, but also with that old Eastwood toughness and, when the film calls for it, the pro's charm. Unsurprisingly, most of the memorable lines in the script are reserved for him, yet not all are spoken; many of the best lines are communicated solely through his face and gestures and even an occasional growl. The former Dirty Harry and Man with No Name is the centerpiece, of course, but it would have been nice if the generally well-written screenplay (by Nick Schenk, from a story he co-wrote with Dave Johannson) gave the supporting cast more juicy words to say as well. As it is, in the language department, they are, for the most part, mere bystanders.Eastwood has long played heroes whose backgrounds, means and even motives can be questioned. Increasingly, though, each of his characters is also, in his own way, vulnerable. In fact, the latter part of his acting career (""Million Dollar Baby,"" ""Unforgiven"" and, to a lesser degree, ""The Outlaw Josie Wales""), has seen him make something of a specialty of playing such people, and his depiction in his latest film fits that category like an weathered shoe fits an old pro.This film, in some ways a sleeper of the season, has much to say about big issues that affect us all: culture, tolerance, acceptance, redemption. Overall, it says them quite well, in its understated way, handling its issues more credibly than its more flamboyant counterpart from Eastwood this season, ""Changeling."" This, I suppose, is the most important difference of all between the films. Not that you need to see both to enjoy ""Gran Torino.""",4,Gran Torino: A Review.,1234742400,"02 16, 2009",2009,7573,"['Clint', 'Eastwood', 'second', 'directorial', 'endeavor', '2007', 'second',

1208866,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B001KVZ6ES,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[3, 5]","In the span of the last few months of 2008, director Clint Eastwood explores two ""back in the day"" characters that clench their fists at America demanding a transformation for the better.  Christine (Angelina Jolie) in ""Changeling"" roars at an established seat of corrupt power in 1920s Los Angeles; she seeks justice for wrongs appropriated towards her by the LA Police Department. Similarly, Walter Kowalski of ""Gran Torino"" snarls with trademark Eastwood defiance at an America reflected in a depleted Detroit; he desires a turning back of the clock to the oldMotor City Madnessand what he deems the easier more understandable time of the 60s and 70s when the American automotive industry was king.Is Walter just a dinosaur roaring with all the effectiveness of any soon-to-be extinct creature?  Or is he keening for a lost world where America floated in a gumbo of ingenuity both technological and industrial in a pot set high above the stratosphere in terms of almost everything?  Back in his day, the average American prospered probably because of the fact that most people yearned to be just that--average or rather, ideal Americans.  That idyllic era of gas-guzzling muscle cars that were and still are the envy of every male on either side of the equator was not encumbered by the stifling dynamic of political correctness that in its attempt to be courteous and respectful of each cultural and religious difference of the individual ingredients that poured in the country's unique and ever-changing melting pot somehow managed to weaken a slowly evolving American civilization. Certainly not a Mayflower descendant, Walter represents the second-generation immigrant who got by in WASP-centric microcosm with a high-end work ethic and blew off steam with the likes of ethnic jokes and stereotypical caricatures.Everyone, no matter from what point of origin their grandparents hailed, had the desire to emulate their ideal American. I, with my dark hair and ethnic eyes, wanted nothing more than to be the American girl next door--a combination of socialite sleuth Nancy Drew with her boyfriend Ned driving around their town in her roadster and freckle-faced Trixie Belden of upstate New York living on Crabapple Farm and riding about the countryside on her favorite horse, Susie.  Moms and apple pie ruled supreme, teachers commandeered respect and minding one's p's and q's meant actually holding a door for a lady or smiling while saying `Good Morning' for no other reason than it was impolite not to do so and because that's what one said.  In that era, the homogenization process insured a certain progress towards realizing the American dream of the white picket fence, a requisite dog or cat and a swing on the front porch.  Maybe we were constricted and uptight.  Maybe we repressed things and certainly never talked about sex or made a public display of naked midsections or the top of a thong above a pair of jeans.  In fact, to talk about politics, religion or sex was a breach of etiquette.  We all knew we were different, but we all were striving towards the same goal--to be as American as possible.In our brave new world, the land at which Walter so openly sneers, America has become more wok than melting pot--all the divergent ingredients sizzle together creating an interesting m&eacute;lange but never quite lose their different flavor.  Does it work?Clint Eastwood's Walter doesn't think so. His once blue-collar neighborhood of carefully groomed lawns and well-kept moderately priced homes houses gangs and other unsavory factions that remind him of countries he toured during his stint in the military.  When his Hmong neighbors--two intelligent teenagers (the natural and charming Bee Vang and Ahney Her) that want nothing but a chance to win their own success--are beleaguered by threatening thugs, Walter takes care of business old school in the most entertaining and crowd-pleasing manner as set in motion by the life-toughened avengers like Dirty Harry Callahan, the Man with No Name, and William Munny.Bottom line?  Clint Eastwood's ""Gran Torino"" may seem like the usual vigilante shoot-`em-up.  Clint packs a mean gun, but delivers much more than that in this 21st century tale of where America now is as opposed to where it was and what it might take to get some of its bravado back. Eastwood's wonderfully expressive face puckers with anger at Detroit's (and America's) industry-lacking streets and a diversity-friendly focus that may just take America off its game.

Playing grouchy, curmudgeonly Walt Kawolski in his film GRAN TORINO, Eastwood hurls racial slurs and insults by the barrel--and gets away with it.  Why?  Because his Walt Kawolski is very believable; he's a throwback to an era time has passed by, and he's a bystander to a community and a neighborhood so fundamentally changed he no longer recognizes it, and it angers and confuses him.  A widower much estranged from his two sons and their families, Walt's world consists of a modest two-story he's owned for more than 50 years, his dog, and his prized possession '72 Gran Torino.  He's not happy at all his neighborhood is being settled by scores of Hmong immigrants; and he's not about to take any guff from the local Hmong gang wreaking havoc in the area.  He grudgingly befriends a brother and sister living next door (Bee Vang and Ahney Her), which sets the stage for the inevitable showdown with the gang.  And the showdown is a guaranteed heart breaker.Again, Eastwood's racial snarls and politically incorrect bluntness work so very well because most of us know some seniors who call 'em as they see 'em, feelings be damned.  Yet Walt does go on a journey of his own, as he eventually learns a modicum of tolerance and acceptance.  And, he also has his own existential reflection as he comes to grips with the notion of death.  It's this existential element that leads to the powerful climax as Walt confronts the gang and makes that fatal reach inside his jacket; yet Walt also realizes by paying such an ultimate price he is also saving the only people he truly cares about.  One star off as the film does meander at times in its uneven delivery, yet it won't take away from your enjoyment of Eastwood's tough-as-nails GRAN TORINO edge.--D.

He is at his best in his portrayal of Walt Kowalski in ""Gran Torino."" Walt is a grumpy, snarly Korean War vet who has just lost his wife. (The movie begins at his wife's funeral, where we get our first glimpse of Walt's acerbic temperament.) A longtime resident of a blue-collar Detroit neighborhood, Walt is upset at its changing character. A onetime white neighborhood, its residents are now mostly the Hmong people, who, as one of them explains to Walt, were strong allies of the United States in their fight against the Vietcong during the Vietnam War. When the movie begins, Walt has nothing but contempt for these people, including the extended family that lives next door.Over time, and as a result of a variety of encounters, Walt's attitude changes. We see him protecting a Hmong girl from a couple hoodlums, thus winning her gratitude and that of her family. He also befriends a teenage Hmong boy, who wants to go straight but who is being pressured to join a Hmong gang. In the end, he lays down his life for this family that at one time he counted as his enemies but are now truly his friends.Although ""Gran Torino"" has its moments of violence, none of it is gratuitous. Its message of redemption is unmistakable, and, along with Clint Eastwood's acting and directing, makes the movie worth watching.",5,Eastwood at his best,1380758400,"10 3, 2013",2013,1428,"['Clint', 'Eastwood', 'acted', 'many', 'memorable', 'movies', 'time', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'character', 'best', 'portrayal', 'Walt', 'Kowalski', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'Walt', 'grumpy', 'snarly', 'Korean', 'War', 'vet', 'who', 'just', 'lost', 'wife', 'movie', 'wife', 'funeral', 'where', 'get', 'first', 'glimpse', 'Walt', 'acerbic', 'temperament', 'longtime', 'resident', 'blue-collar', 'Detroit', 'neighborhood', 'Walt', 'upset', 'changing', 'character', 'onetime', 'white', 'neighborhood', 'residents', 'are', 'now', 'mostly', 'Hmong', 'people', 'who', 'one', 'Walt', 'were', 'strong', 'allies', 'United', 'States', 'fight', 'Vietcong', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'When', 'movie', 'Walt', 'nothing', 'contempt', 'people', 'including', 'extended', 'family', 'next', 'door.Over', 'time', 'result', 'variety', 'encounters', 'Walt', 'attitude', 'changes', 'see', 'protecting', 'Hmong', 'girl', 'couple', 'hoodlums', 'thus', 'winning', 'gratitude', 'family', 'also', 'teenage', 'Hmong', 'boy', 'who', 'go', 'straight', 'who', 'being', 'pressured', 'join', 'Hmong', 'gang', 'end', 'down', 'life', 'family', 'one', 'time', 'counted', 'enemies', 'are', 'now', 'truly', 'friends.Although', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'moments', 'violence', 'none', 'gratuitous', 'message', 'redemption', 'unmistakable', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'acting', 'directing', 'movie', 'watching']",Gran Torino

He lives in a run-down section of Detroit (please pardon my redundancy!).  Walt is a crotchety old hermit who would like everyone to believe that he is cold & heartless.  Just one problem:  in spite of a rough exterior, Walt has a heart of gold!At his wife's funeral he finds that his two sons & their families are selfish & narcissistic.  They only care for Walt insofar as the property they will inherit from him after he passes away.  Not exactly solace for a man who has worked hard all of his life!Juxtaposed with his self-centered family are Oriental neighbors who live around Walt.  After inadvertently rescuing a young man from the attack of a gang, Walt becomes something of a hero to his neighbors.  Unlike his own family, who could care less about him, the racist retired Ford worker finds them to be eternally thankful to them, and much more gracious than his own family would  ever dream of being.This is the outline of the film.  In some ways, it is a little bit like a raw, violent, downtown Detroit version ofFinding Forrester.  To be sure, the thugs in the film are unreasonable in every way ~ straight out ofGangland: The Complete Season One.  They're not much in the brains department, but their anarchist approach to life makes them scary dudes.One of the more remarkable things about this movie is just how ordinary all of the characters are.  These are people all of us have dealt with in our everyday lives ~ both good & bad.  There are no supermodel actresses in the film, & there is no lush scenery.  It's just Clint Eastwood and the drab scenery of the city of Detroit (I've been there myself, and it's hardly a scenic locale).  These aspects are not a negative of the movie, but rather they just drive-home how much the film depicts the life of everyday personas.I swear that Clint Eastwood's scowl is every bit as much of a cinematic icon as the starship Enterprise, Andie MacDowell's smile, ""shaken, not stirred"" & ""I'll be back.""  Clint is about the only thespian I know of who can wear a frown on his face the entire movie and still(!) portray a likeable character.So, if you're a fan of Clint's, this instant-classic is a must-see.

Not that there isn't fertile ground for exploration along these lines; Eastwood's isolated, closed-minded widower could have been an excellent vehicle for prodding a number of inherent stereotypes present in modern American suburbia. Instead of meeting those issues head-on, though, it spends most of its time stalking up and down the sidelines and, often, reinforcing the kind of bull-headed resistance to different cultures that, at the outset, it seemed ready to confront. I had a hard time accepting any of this film's main players as anything more than thin caricatures, especially considering the bland, straightforward dialog they're given to work with, and that resulted in a major emotional disconnect during the climax.

Thang is saved by his cousin from certain death. As part of an initiation into the gang, they get Thang to try to steal his neighbor's coveted prize, a 1972 Gran Torino.Paralleled into the story we get glimpses of superficial attempts by Walt's son in trying to `help him' adjust to his wife's death by trying to convince him to move into a retirement community. We get a perspective from the other son, as a `leech' trying to see if he can acquire tickets for a game from his father. Walt's immediate family is only set upon what they can get from him rather than trying to help him. His family truly does not understand him and we are left wondering if they ever do understand him.Father Janovich (Christopher Carley) is a newly minted priest trying to watch over his flock member, Walt, as a dying wish by Walt's wife. He tries to get an introspective look at Walt and equally trying to gain his respect to get through to him. The interactions are bleak and sometimes comical.Caught in the act, Walt discovers Thang trying to steal the vehicle but escapes. The Gran Torino becomes the central symbol of the movie, coveted by Walt's Granddaughter, Ashley, and other characters in the movie. The movie progresses as Walt saves Thang from being abducted from his home and Walt is seen as a hero in the community. Walt is soon befriended by Thang's sister , Sue Lor (Ahney Her). He saves her from a confrontation with an African American street gang and her respect for him is heightened. Walt develops a relationship with his alien neighbors and learns more and more about their culture. He soon finds more things in common with his Hmong neighbor's than his own family. Being indebted to Walt, the Lor family makes Thang, called Toad by Walt, work various jobs as retribution and to restore his Hmong honor. The transformation by both Walt and Toad evolves as both men learn from each other, and they develop mutual respect for each other. Walt helps Toad with his social inhibition, coming of age and his career goals, and Toad helps Walt appreciate the other Hmong members in the community and learn to respect himself. Toad becomes a man and Walt achieves peace and becomes the father figure that he always longed for.Major conflict occurs between the Lor family and the Hmong gang, and we are left wondering how the resolution of this terror is resolved.This movie is a dark depiction of the reality of many industrial cities abandoned by the shut down of big industry, and the sad conditions that many people face by crime and racial tensions. It is also an introspective look into achieve one's true happiness. Riddled with various racial comments through the movie, it is a harsh reality of the uphill struggles that this country still has to work upon. It is with respect of others for both their similarities and differences that the characters were able to break their self imposed boundaries.The movie was well done, and character development was very good. I was able to relate to the perspective of each character as the story unfolded.

This is a straightforward, no-punches-pulled story of part of a America as she exists today. And a sad state of affairs it is. This film accurately and painfully depicts the kind of cultural clash and disrespect of valor and elder experience that's eroding the foundation of what this country stands for. At the end of this movie, the question is quite clear: Who, after men like this are gone, will possess and demonstrate the integrity of this man?",5,Raised my estimation of Eastwood,1245542400,"06 21, 2009",2009,535,"['Would', 'Hollywood', 'were', 'still', 'filled', 'brim', 'men', 'Eastwood', 'character', 'straightforward', 'no-punches-pulled', 'story', 'part', 'America', 'today', 'sad', 'state', 'affairs', 'film', 'accurately', 'painfully', 'kind', 'cultural', 'clash', 'disrespect', 'valor', 'elder', 'experience', 'eroding', 'foundation', 'what', 'country', 'end', 'movie', 'question', 'quite', 'clear', 'Who', 'men', 'are', 'gone', 'will', 'possess', 'demonstrate', 'integrity', 'man']",Gran Torino
1208890,AT6CZDCP4TRGA,B001KVZ6ES,Eduarrdo Nietzsche,"[1, 2]","Since so many reviews here have provided a plot summary, I'm just going to write comments...There were many, many points in this movie that made me cringe, expecting to be run over by sentimentalism and stereotypes.  For example when Kowalski takes Thao with him to teach him ""how to be a man""---I thought they'd wind up in a bar with a bunch of K's buddies competing to see who had the biggest wanger, but no something else entirely (not all that believable, but at least it was rather original) happens.So this movie is a lot like that.  It directly addresses and traffics in some all-too-common racial stereotypes and bigotry, yet somehow manages to transcend them in a way that is not hopelessly corny or preachy.  The ending is rather surprising, kind of Buddhist in fact---true self-sacrifice, a little idealistic perhaps, but at least not the usual macho-superhero-vigilante fantasy.  Considering Eastwood's filmography and iconic image, ""Gran Torino"" is actually very subversive, in its quiet and understated way.  There is a subtle element of satire and parody here, which most viewers will probably miss: Eastwood is actually poking fun at cranky aggrieved old white guys and their cartoonish ideas about masculinity.  At the same time he presents an alternative scenario in which that bitter old geezer finally becomes a TRUE man, i.e. a FULL HUMAN BEING, by growing beyond his own petty prejudices and, at the surprise ending, transcending his own ego and truly sacrificing himself wholeheartedly and voluntarily---in contrast to being a frightened overgrown boy forced to play soldier by the Army.My only reservations, and the reason I'm giving this 4 instead of 5 stars, is that Eastwood could have been a better director in terms of eliciting better performances from his two Hmong leads, Bee Vang and Ahney Her, who reminded me of kids acting in a school play.  Bee Vang is especially amateurish, especially in the last part when Kowalski locks him in the basement to prevent him from following.  Surely Eastwood could've hired acting coaches to better prepare and train these two?I was also disappointed with the Special Features on the DVD...basically it's a vintage car fan's wet dream, and there's lots of sophomoric babbling about cars and ""masculinity""---but what about for the rest of us?  A little mini-documentary snippet on the history of the Hmong and their dealings with the US military in Indochina would have been much more interesting and apropos.

Pauzer,"[4, 4]","If watching a film over and over again is any indication of a great story, this one merits such praise.Always playing a quintessential American, he repeats such a performance here as a recently widowed retiree and Korean war veteran who resents the HMong Asians that are taking over his neighborhood. His well-kept home and mannicured lawn adorned with an American flag represent his values, and stands as a beacon in a neighborhood that is being overcome by neglect and overrun by gangs. Wanting to be left alone, his contempt for customs, dress and language of his neighbors is palpable in word and facial expression. He shares almost as much contempt for his neglectful sons, and his granddaughter whom he despises for her dress and lack of manners.A strange relationship develops when he finds out one of his neighbors attempted to steal his pristine, 1972, Gran Torino that he helped build in his assemly line career at Ford Motor Company. The boy's mother insists he make restitution for the family's honor. The man who just wants to be left alone is drawn to the would-be thief and the family he disdains. We see him as a curmudgeon who pays them compliments with insults such as ""I could use some good gook food,"" when invited for dinner. In fact his character, Walt Kowalski uses all of them under the Sun (Yat Sen).  Yet, their respect for such a disrespectful man grows, as he takes the boy under his wing and becomes the protector of the rest of his family.This is where Eastwood's performance soars. He appears to be in constant conflict with his prejudice against his sense of justice and fair play. He goes over the edge when one of the family members suffers at the hands of a local gang. Justice must be served and sacrifices must be made. Their mutual devotion replaces the lack of the same with his own family.Clint Eastwood has delivered such memorable characters as Dirty Harry and Josie Wales with great lines such as, ""Go ahead; make my day"" and ""Dyin's not much of a livin'."" Like a good wine or scotch improves with age, Eastwood becomes equally memorable as a director. When he directs and acts, it is topnotch entertainment from a very simple story of a complicated human being. His supporting cast is also superb, and this film may launch future careers to prominence. The score, if you can call it that, is mellow and almost haunting.There is not a dull moment in this film in what starts off as a seemingly bland plot. With a penchant for a wandering mind for average stories, I was not only transfixed watching it, but watched it two more times to pick up nuance I might have missed. I was never bored.I don't think you will be bored either.

1208892,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B001KVZ6ES,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[3, 4]","The incisive reviews for this film are numerous, and I remove my hat to them. For the interested dvd-buyer, I have a few words. Also, I wish to speak to the cinematic merit of this film.Being an Eastwood fan since ""Paint Your Wagon"", and a veteran watcher of his spaghetti Westerns, Eastwood can do no wrong by me. As a director/producer, his seminal work on jazz musician Thelonious Monk in ""Straight, No Chaser"" will stand as hugely in the future as ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil"".""Gran Torino"", in my view, does not meet the standards of the two abovementioned films. In the still-lambent light of ""Million Dollar Baby"", it is a rather trivial little thing. What strikes me most is that you will love this beginning to end if you love Eastwood; otherwise you might think you just been had by yet another overblown after-school-special-type flick.Still, I have to admit no one could do this sort of thing except Eastwood. No one would have the balls, no one would have the talent or the know-how. This brings me to ask, ""Why didn't Eastwood make this film better?""I know there are intense comments in other reviews about how great this is as a statement about racism...somehow I wonder if Eastwood really meant it exactly that way. After all, the story IS about him, a crusty, nasty old Korean War vet with a big guilt complex about ""killing gooks"". It is always all about him. Perhaps this film is more geared toward the way we change our prejudices. I know the character reminded me of myself--perhaps that's why I'm one of the few who's NOT raving about the movie.Take this review as-is. It isn't in my purview to tell you to avoid the film: I say buy it and watch it 100 times--Eastwood deserves that much, and it is worth watching at the end of the day. Cinematically, it's as perfect as one can get: the cinematography is gorgeous considering the setting. Finally, I'd take a cue from this movie and study up on the Hmong Tribe, very important real-life people living in this country.",4,What Would Would Dirty Harry Do!,1261008000,"12 17, 2009",2009,2003,"['incisive', 'reviews', 'film', 'are', 'numerous', 'remove', 'hat', 'interested', 'dvd-buyer', 'have', 'few', 'words', 'Also', 'wish', 'speak', 'cinematic', 'merit', 'film.Being', 'Eastwood', 'fan', 'Paint', 'Wagon', 'veteran', 'watcher', 'spaghetti', 'Westerns', 'Eastwood', 'can', 'do', 'wrong', 'director/producer', 'seminal', 'work', 'jazz', 'musician', 'Thelonious', 'Monk', 'Straight', 'No', 'Chaser', 'will', 'stand', 'hugely', 'future', 'Midnight', 'Garden', 'Good', 'Evil', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'view', 'not', 'meet', 'standards', 'two', 'abovementioned', 'films', 'still-lambent', 'light', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'rather', 'trivial', 'little', 'thing', 'What', 'most', 'will', 'love', 'beginning', 'end', 'love', 'Eastwood', 'otherwise', 'might', 'think', 'just', 'been', 'had', 'yet', 'overblown', 'after-school-special-type', 'flick.Still', 'have', 'admit', 'one', 'could', 'do', 'sort', 'thing', 'Eastwood', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'balls', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'talent', 'know-how', 'ask', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'Eastwood', 'make', 'film', 'better', 'know', 'are', 'intense', 'comments', 'other', 'reviews', 'how', 'great', 'statement', 'racism', 'somehow', 'wonder', 'Eastwood', 'really', 'meant', 'exactly', 'way', 'story', 'crusty', 'nasty', 'old', 'Korean', 'War', 'vet', 'big', 'guilt', 'complex', 'killing', 'gooks', 'always', 'Perhaps', 'film', 'more', 'geared', 'way', 'change', 'prejudices', 'know', 'character', 'reminded', 'perhaps', 'why', ""'m"", 'one', 'few', 'who', 'NOT', 'raving', 'movie.Take', 'review', 'as-is', ""n't"", 'purview', 'tell', 'avoid', 'film', 'say', 'buy', 'watch', '100', 'times', 'Eastwood', 'much', 'worth', 'watching', 'end', 'day', 'Cinematically', 'as', 'perfect', 'one', 'can', 'get', 'cinematography', 'gorgeous', 'considering', 'setting', 'Finally', ""'d"", 'take', 'cue', 'movie', 'study', 'up', 'Hmong', 'Tribe', 'very', 'important', 'real-life', 'people', 'living', 'country']",Gran Torino

But even if the Academy does not bestow one award on what is probably Clint Eastwood's last movie as an actor, remember this: ""Gran Torino"" is a more intelligent film on the state of race relations today than ""Crash"" (a multiple Oscar winner) ever pretended to be.The story is about Walt Kowalski, a grizzled Korean War vet and widower who spends his time drinking, smoking, and polishing his 1972 Ford Gran Torino, a vintage example of Detroit muscle.  Because he installed the car's steering column himself, the car represents not only a classically American fixation on the automobile, but also a blue-collar, pull-yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps work ethic, one that Eastwood himself would no doubt agree with.  (If for some reason you don't believe me, read his ""What I've Learned"" interview in the latest issue of Esquire.)Kowalski mentors an aimless Hmong teenager named Thao, who is being pressured to join his cousin's gang.  This is where the ""Karate Kid"" comparison comes in, which is inaccurate, partly because the characters of ""Gran Torino"" exhibit considerably greater depth.  The boy who plays Thao (and in fact all of the Hmong characters) is not a professional actor, so although his portrayal is sometimes rather wooden, there really isn't any substitute for authenticity.  Eastwood came of age in an era when Hollywood produced war movies using, say, a Chinese actor to portray a Japanese soldier.  It's clear from the casting of ""Gran Torino"" (and ""Letters from Iwo Jima,"" for that matter) that Eastwood prefers to do things his own way.Kowalski makes fun of Thao (calling him ""Toad""), but also teaches the boy how to earn an honest living.  In the process, he becomes closer to Thao's family than he is to any of his own kin, who have degenerated into a distant, crass, materialistic clan of their own, far removed from the values Kowalski attempted to pass on.The steady stream of racist epithets in ""Gran Torino"" will cause some people to laugh uncomfortably, others to laugh with delight, and still another group to glare at those who are laughing.  Ultimately, however, this unsettling portrayal of one man's deep prejudices evolves into a different story altogether.  It is not possible to show the audience a path away from a racist mentality without showing honestly where that mentality came from--a feat which ""Crash,"" in spite of its heavy-handed moralizing, never came close to pulling off.",4,"A Better Movie about Racism than ""Crash""",1231113600,"01 5, 2009",2009,2628,"['People', 'react', 'strongly', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'embracing', 'depiction', 'flawed', 'heroic', 'racist', 'old', 'coot', 'deriding', 'movie', 'simply', 'apparent', 'political', 'incorrectness', 'nervous', 'even', 'Academy', 'not', 'bestow', 'one', 'award', 'what', 'probably', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'last', 'movie', 'actor', 'remember', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'more', 'intelligent', 'film', 'state', 'race', 'relations', 'today', 'Crash', 'multiple', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'ever', 'pretended', 'be.The', 'story', 'Walt', 'Kowalski', 'grizzled', 'Korean', 'War', 'vet', 'widower', 'who', 'time', 'drinking', 'smoking', 'polishing', '1972', 'Ford', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'vintage', 'example', 'Detroit', 'muscle', 'installed', 'car', 'steering', 'column', 'car', 'not', 'only', 'classically', 'American', 'fixation', 'automobile', 'also', 'blue-collar', 'pull-yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps', 'work', 'ethic', 'one', 'Eastwood', 'would', 'no', 'doubt', 'agree', 'reason', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'read', 'What', ""'ve"", 'Learned', 'interview', 'latest', 'issue', 'Esquire', 'Kowalski', 'mentors', 'aimless', 'Hmong', 'teenager', 'named', 'Thao', 'who', 'being', 'pressured', 'join', 'cousin', 'gang', 'where', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'comparison', 'inaccurate', 'partly', 'characters', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'exhibit', 'considerably', 'greater', 'depth', 'boy', 'who', 'Thao', 'fact', 'Hmong', 'characters', 'not', 'professional', 'actor', 'portrayal', 'sometimes', 'rather', 'wooden', 'really', ""n't"", 'substitute', 'authenticity', 'Eastwood', 'came', 'age', 'era', 'when', 'Hollywood', 'produced', 'war', 'movies', 'using', 'say', 'Chinese', 'actor', 'portray', 'Japanese', 'soldier', 'clear', 'casting', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'Letters', 'Iwo', 'Jima', 'matter', 'Eastwood', 'prefers', 'do', 'things', 'own', 'way.Kowalski', 'fun', 'Thao', 'calling', 'Toad', 'also', 'boy', 'how', 'earn', 'honest', 'living', 'process', 'closer', 'Thao', 'family', 'own', 'kin', 'who', 'have', 'degenerated', 'distant', 'crass', 'materialistic', 'clan', 'own', 'far', 'removed', 'values', 'Kowalski', 'attempted', 'pass', 'on.The', 'steady', 'stream', 'racist', 'epithets', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'will', 'cause', 'people', 'laugh', 'uncomfortably', 'others', 'laugh', 'delight', 'still', 'group', 'glare', 'who', 'are', 'laughing', 'Ultimately', 'however', 'unsettling', 'portrayal', 'one', 'man', 'deep', 'prejudices', 'different', 'story', 'altogether', 'not', 'possible', 'show', 'audience', 'path', 'away', 'racist', 'mentality', 'showing', 'honestly', 'where', 'mentality', 'came', 'feat', 'Crash', 'spite', 'heavy-handed', 'moralizing', 'never', 'came', 'close', 'pulling', 'off']",Gran Torino
1208897,A17IDP37NM8TFJ,B001KVZ6ES,Eugene Chamson,"[6, 8]","If Clint Eastwood never makes another movie, Gran Torino will serve as the ideal swan song for an actor/director who has spent a career playing tough guys with tortured souls, and yes, tender hearts.Here Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski, an aging Korean war vet still haunted by his past and simmering with rage and racism.  Alone now after the death of his wife,  Walt is alienated from his family and irritated by everything in his world, especially the Asian family that has moved in next door.In typical Eastwood style, he fearlessly confronts neighborhood bullies and gang members the way we imagine an aging Dirty Harry might.  For those of us who grew up watching Eastwood take care of bad guys, it's very satisfying to see the old master stick it to a new generation of punks.  And Eastwood is not above self-parody.  So when Walt aims a shotgun at a bully and snarls ""Get off my lawn!"" the audience has a good laugh.As events force Walt to deal with, and eventually protect the Asians next door, we watch as his tough and racist persona gradually thaws and he enters into tentative friendship with his neighbors.  This is another satisfying element of the film.  The scenes where Walt, in his gruffy crude way, ends up helping the young Asian boy next door, are especially warm and heartful.But beyond the rehabilitation of a bitter racist, Gran Torino is also a meditation on the limits of violence.  For all his toughness, Walt isn't able to keep the violence from escalating.  And it eventually forces him to come to terms with his violent past.The ending is unexpected and out of character, which is what makes it brilliant.  In the end, Walt heals his wounds and transcends his past.  And by making this film, so does Eastwood.  It will be a classic.",5,Funny and poignant story is a fitting tribute to Eastwood's career,1230422400,"12 28, 2008",2008,1760,"['Clint', 'Eastwood', 'never', 'movie', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'will', 'serve', 'ideal', 'swan', 'song', 'actor/director', 'who', 'spent', 'career', 'playing', 'tough', 'guys', 'tortured', 'souls', 'yes', 'tender', 'hearts.Here', 'Eastwood', 'plays', 'Walt', 'Kowalski', 'aging', 'Korean', 'war', 'vet', 'still', 'haunted', 'past', 'simmering', 'rage', 'racism', 'Alone', 'now', 'death', 'wife', 'Walt', 'alienated', 'family', 'irritated', 'everything', 'world', 'especially', 'Asian', 'family', 'moved', 'next', 'door.In', 'typical', 'Eastwood', 'style', 'fearlessly', 'neighborhood', 'bullies', 'gang', 'members', 'way', 'imagine', 'aging', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'might', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'Eastwood', 'take', 'care', 'bad', 'guys', 'very', 'satisfying', 'see', 'old', 'master', 'stick', 'new', 'generation', 'punks', 'Eastwood', 'not', 'self-parody', 'So', 'when', 'Walt', 'shotgun', 'bully', 'snarls', 'Get', 'lawn', 'audience', 'good', 'laugh.As', 'events', 'force', 'Walt', 'deal', 'eventually', 'protect', 'Asians', 'next', 'door', 'watch', 'tough', 'racist', 'persona', 'gradually', 'thaws', 'tentative', 'friendship', 'neighbors', 'satisfying', 'element', 'film', 'scenes', 'where', 'Walt', 'gruffy', 'crude', 'way', 'up', 'helping', 'young', 'Asian', 'boy', 'next', 'door', 'are', 'especially', 'warm', 'heartful.But', 'rehabilitation', 'bitter', 'racist', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'also', 'meditation', 'limits', 'violence', 'toughness', 'Walt', ""n't"", 'able', 'keep', 'violence', 'escalating', 'eventually', 'come', 'terms', 'violent', 'past.The', 'ending', 'unexpected', 'character', 'what', 'brilliant', 'end', 'Walt', 'wounds', 'past', 'making', 'film', 'so', 'Eastwood', 'will', 'be', 'classic']",Gran Torino

1208900,A73DFWJE0CGY6,B001KVZ6ES,"Flight Risk (The Gypsy Moth) ""Exiled Yankee""","[2, 2]","Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is a man who has groomed his role as the neighbourhood curmudgeon into fine art. He is still sort of fighting the Korean War; he dislikes and distrusts anybody whose ethnicity is not red-blooded White American; and he isn't afraid to air out his opinions. He isn't fond of his relatives, either; his kids want to put him in a  retirement community, his granddaughter wants his stuff, and nobody wants to leave him alone, including the babyfaced young priest of the church his wife belonged to, and who she recruited to look after Walt after she passed away.Walt wants to be allowed to live quietly with his old Lab, sitting on the porch and enjoying breakfasts of jerky and beer. His composure, such as it is, is disturbed by the arrival next door of new tenants - an Asian family with two teenagers, one of whom is a boy with no direction and an older teen daughter who makes it her life's goal to civilize Walt. Her efforts are stymied by one of her relatives, a gang member intent on bringing her brother into the gang and who won't take no for an answer. During one of his attempts to cow the brother, Thao (Bee Vang),he butts heads with Walt, who takes exception to anybody having loud altercations on his lawn, and who brings his rifle with him to get rid of them. The gang member cousin's way of getting back at Walt is to make Thao's initiation into the gang the theft of Walt's most prized possession - his 70s-era Gran Torino.Things go a trifle wrong, and Thao escapes from Walt's middle-of-the-night pursuit after bungling the theft. The movie intensifies from this point; the girl, Sue (Ahney Her), decides that what Thao needs is a dose of Walt, teaching him to be a man. There are continuing confrontations with the bad elements of the neighbourhood - as in many old settled communities, as the older people die or leave, ethnic groups have come in, and they don't always get along - and Walt, feeling a bit embattled, rules over his home as though it were a fortress, keeping an eye on everybody. He grudgingly comes to terms with his new Asian neighbours, who have elevated him to protector for fearlessly standing up to the bad guys, and just as grudgingly takes Thao under his wing when the boy's family makes him go to work for Walt to pay off his debt for trying to take the car.If you are sensitive to racial slurs, don't bother with this movie; I heard more derogatory ethnic terms in 2 hours than I think I have ever heard before. Walt is not shy to call people what he thinks to their faces; the Italian barber he has gone to for years is used to it, and gives back as good as he gets, but the polite Asian family next door doesn't know what to make of their crude neighbour; the young priest takes the crusty old badger in stride, and never lets up on trying to bring him into his confidence. I was mildly disturbed by Walt's continuous verbal racial slurs, but I grew up with guys like him, so I tried to see beyond them and view them in the context of the story. What I got from it was all the older components of the movie - Walt, his old dog, the old grandmother next door, the Gran Torino - all survivors of a simpler age, old warhorses learning how to coexist with a new world.And hey, it's Clint Eastwood. How can it be bad?

I won't say better about my admiration with Eastwood than Roger Ebert did: ""What other figure in the history of the cinema has been an actor for 53 years, a director for 37, won two Oscars for direction, two more for best picture, plus the Thalberg Award, and at 78 can direct himself in his own film and look meaner than hell? None, that's how many."" How many actors can play a character who is in the beginning truly unlikable, hating, angry old racist but during the course of two hours he would turn to you with such different facets that it would break your heart, move you deeply, make you want to have old Walt as your friend, and make you think that Walt's late wife, the only love of his life was a lucky lady? Eastwood pulled it admirably, and I can't think of any other Artist who could.Many viewers and reviewers talk about Eastwood's returning to his most known and admired cult role of Insp. 'Dirty' Harry Callahan', and it is true, but the film is about many many things - about sad loneliness of aging, for once. It is about how hostility, mistrust and contempt for people of different from you language, way of life, traditions, culture, and background can be slowly but gradually replaced by interest, mutual respect, and understanding. It is also about the loss or not even ever having connection with your own family and not finding the way to re-connect. The film shows that it is never too late to change something in yourself, to become better - no matter how long you have to live. The last theme brought to my mind the film made 57 years ago by great Akira Kurosawa, ""Ikiru"" - ""To Live"". Very different, both films have in common the theme of inevitability of the end of a life and what can be done if the end is close?And what about Gran Torino? It is the rare collector's car of 1972 which sits in Walt Kowalski's (Eastwood) garage. Walt, who had worked 50 years at the Ford's factory in Detroit, Michigan, participated in its assembly and bought it in the same year. Gran Torino was the reason he got to know and involved in the lives of his next door neighbors even though he never planned or expected for that to happen.",5,"Walt Kowalski : I may not be the most pleasant person to be around...,",1232323200,"01 19, 2009",2009,2758,"['***', 'comment', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***If', 'rumors', 'are', 'true', 'Walt', 'Kowalski', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'last', 'acting', 'role', 'then', 'Eastwood', 'director', 'staged', 'performed', 'grand', 'exit', 'gloriously', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'been', 'called', 'not', 'perfect', 'movie', 'blamed', 'handling', 'very', 'controversial', 'subjects', 'rather', 'heavily', 'may', 'agree', 'statements', 'perfect', 'not', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'fantastic', 'poignant', 'movie', 'storytelling', 'best', 'characters', 'got', 'know', 'understand', 'care', 'interaction', 'seem', 'real', 'ending', 'moved', 'end', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'better', 'admiration', 'Eastwood', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'did', 'What', 'other', 'figure', 'history', 'cinema', 'been', 'actor', '53', 'years', 'director', '37', 'won', 'two', 'Oscars', 'direction', 'two', 'more', 'best', 'picture', 'Thalberg', 'Award', '78', 'can', 'direct', 'own', 'film', 'look', 'meaner', 'hell', 'None', 'how', 'many', 'How', 'many', 'actors', 'can', 'play', 'character', 'who', 'beginning', 'truly', 'unlikable', 'hating', 'angry', 'old', 'racist', 'course', 'two', 'hours', 'would', 'turn', 'such', 'different', 'facets', 'would', 'break', 'heart', 'move', 'deeply', 'make', 'want', 'have', 'old', 'Walt', 'friend', 'make', 'think', 'Walt', 'late', 'wife', 'only', 'love', 'life', 'was', 'lucky', 'lady', 'Eastwood', 'pulled', 'admirably', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'other', 'Artist', 'who', 'viewers', 'reviewers', 'talk', 'Eastwood', 'returning', 'most', 'known', 'admired', 'cult', 'role', 'Insp', 'Harry', 'Callahan', 'true', 'film', 'many', 'many', 'things', 'about', 'sad', 'loneliness', 'aging', 'once', 'how', 'hostility', 'mistrust', 'contempt', 'people', 'different', 'language', 'way', 'life', 'traditions', 'culture', 'background', 'can', 'be', 'slowly', 'gradually', 'replaced', 'interest', 'mutual', 'respect', 'understanding', 'also', 'loss', 'not', 'even', 'ever', 'having', 'connection', 'own', 'family', 'not', 'finding', 'way', 're-connect', 'film', 'never', 'too', 'late', 'change', 'something', 'become', 'better', 'matter', 'how', 'long', 'have', 'live', 'last', 'theme', 'brought', 'mind', 'film', 'made', '57', 'years', 'ago', 'great', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'Ikiru', 'Live', 'Very', 'different', 'films', 'have', 'common', 'theme', 'inevitability', 'end', 'life', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'end', 'close', 'what', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'rare', 'collector', 'car', '1972', 'Walt', 'Kowalski', 'Eastwood', 'garage', 'Walt', 'who', 'had', 'worked', '50', 'years', 'Ford', 'factory', 'Detroit', 'Michigan', 'participated', 'assembly', 'bought', 'same', 'year', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'was', 'reason', 'got', 'know', 'involved', 'lives', 'next', 'door', 'neighbors', 'even', 'never', 'planned', 'expected', 'happen']",Gran Torino

1208912,AY12DBB0U420B,B001KVZ6ES,Gary Peterson,"[2, 2]","Last night's bargain-rack movie was Gran Torino starring Clint Eastwood. This one came from the 5-dollar rack at Wall-Mart and was quite a good movie. Of course, I've always liked Clint Eastwood and have a big collection of his movies. In this movie, Eastwood appeared quite old. He played a veteran of the Korean War, and his true age is just about right for the part.Eastwood lived in a decaying part of an older big city. His wife had died and he was now all alone. Most of the original residents of his neighborhood were gone and the new wave of people were mostly Asian. Some Hmung people lived next door, much to his dislike, and the area was plagued with gangs. The ""Gran Torino"" of the title was for an aging but very-well-kept-up 1972 Pontiac he had stored in his garage. The car was coveted by some of the young hoods of the neighborhood. Eastwood was the old Eastwood and had a few guns and issued a few Eastwood-type threats that kept the hoods at a distance.Eastwood was an aging curmudgeon and angry with seemingly everything in the modern world. Several times he helped the next door family out of threatening situations, for which they were very pleased, and they gradually and grudgingly became friends. Eastwood befriended the young boy and trained him and helped him to get a construction job. It was an uplifting story, probably played over and over in modern America, and well worth watching. Everything about the movie was first rate, but I'd expect that with an Eastwood movie.Gary Peterson",5,Eastwood As An Aging Curmudgeon.

However, those of us born in or after the ""Baby Boom"" should have learned better by now. We had the benefit of growing up watching shows like ""All in the Family"", and ""Sanford & Son"" to poke vicious satire at bigoted thinking, and so we hope at least to have moved on.""Gran Torino"" is a great film that gives us some great lessons in dramatic form. Clint Eastwood's character Walt Kowalski is a man from that earlier generation and he throws epithets out without ever thinking there is anything wrong with it. He hits white ethnicities as much as he does people of color, and it was weird for me to remember that there was a time when speaking like that was common.But here's the thing, Walt is a good man, prejudiced perhaps but still a good man. Walt is forced to consider his racism when he unwillingly gets to know his neighbors. When he asks his young lady neighbor why her people came to America, she explains that her people (the Hmong), fought in alliance with the USA in the Vietnam war, and when America quit, they left the Hmong high and dry, and would be slaughtered if they stayed behind. It seemed to me to click a connection in Walt's brain, then he began the friendship that became closer than family to him.In ""Gran Torino"", Eastwood continues to swing his message away from violent solutions in his films. This is probably my favorite after the ""Unforgiven"", of Eastwood's films promoting this message. It is a thoughtful, well written, well acted and well directed film. That really surprised me in the end.One of the best films I've seen in a while!5*Now there is a missed opportunity however, not with the film, but rather with the DVD, There was a great chance to do some documentary work on the change of demographics in American Culture as well as a specific opportunity for some history about the role of the Hmong in the Viet Nam War. Instead there are some rather banal pieces about America's love affair with the Automobile.

1208920,A2PR6NXG0PA3KY,B001KVZ6ES,Giordano Bruno,"[9, 11]","I should have saved Gran Torino for Father's Day, this coming weekend, and watched it together with my son, maybe as a double feature with The Great Santini. Looking over the reviews of this film here on the Big River, I find that the stars are closely correlated with the reminiscences of ornery old bustard fathers. Mine was one. In fact, my Dad looked almost exactly like Walt Kowalsky, Eastwood's character, at the same age. He dressed the same, walked the same, drank almost the same (slightly better taste in beer), and definitely hated the same. Only his accent was different -- my Dad's -- being a weird acquired country-western drawl on top of his still-Swedish pronunciation. He worshiped, like Kowalski, in the great American Church on Wheels; he was a car mechanic most of his life, and he had a Plymouth Barracuda that he cared for more tenderly than either of his two children. He was washing his car one afternoon, at age 91, when he had a stroke and died with the hose running. Neighbors found him a few hours later when the water started to flood their yard. Those neighbors were Salvadore&ntilde;os rather than Hmong, as in Eastwood's film, but the neighborhood dynamics were equivalent.Some critics have 'explained' Walt Kowalsky's bitter racism and self-hatred as the consequence of his experiences in the Korean War. Eastwood himself expresses that through his character's mouth and through the starchy dialogue between Walt and the young priest who tries to 'understand' him. Honestly, I don't think the atrocities of war were necessary to create a Walt Kowalsky. My father was of an age to have fought in WW2, but he didn't. He dodged, and the rest of his life he did his best to pretend he hadn't. In the '60s, he ""disowned"" me - temporarily - for refusing service in Viet Nam. I see this exoneration of Walt Kowalsky, as a victim of PTSD, as a slight weakness in the concept of Gran Torino, a too-easy excuse for the racism and xenophobia of ""our"" fathers' generation(s).The most touching moment of Gran Torino comes when Walt murmurs that he feels more in common with his g**k neighbors than with his upwardly-mobile sons and their families. That's not a unique perception. Garrison Keillor has expressed it time and again in his Lake Wobegon sketches. Farmers in Iowa, according to NPR, have been finding themselves sharing more with their hired Guatemalan help than with their college-gone heirs; they end up selling the farm to the newcomers and staying on as guests.But my own father never had Walt Kowalsky's epiphany. Tragically, he remained a ranting rightwing racist till the end. The virtue of this film -- this re-examination of 'Dirty Harry' by the actor who made ""dirty Harry' an iconic figure -- is Clint Eastwood's powerful affirmation of a new integrated America, the land where diversity and assimilation can be reconciled. I wish all our fathers had gone that route.Artistically, cinematographically, Eastwood's performance in the role of Kowalsky is the only five-star feature of Gran Torino. The script is no masterpiece, and the other actors range from ""not bad"" to ""well, I've seen worse."" Clint Eastwood is his own most iconic story, from his spaghetti westerns to his comedy surliness to his current confessional maturity.

1208921,A328S9RN3U5M68,B001KVZ6ES,Grady Harp,"[1, 3]","Few films have been able to translate an aspect that war can have on surviving veterans - that aspect being the embedded hate for 'the enemy' that dominates the world view of those who have had to fight in the battlefields, a hate that too easily translates into generalized racism that persists throughout the life of the veteran.  GRAN TORINO takes on this ugly issue and works it with such compelling force that just when the audience feels is cannot tolerate any more racial slurs a transformation takes place, opening a window to understanding and perhaps altering the poison of racism's effects on our American Family.GRAN TORINO as written by Nick Schenk and Dave Johanson and as produced, directed and acted by Clint Eastwood is not a film easy to hear or watch in its early portions.  Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) is burying his wife, only to return to his long term home in a neighborhood that has become a sanctuary for Hmong people (an ethnic  group  from the mountain regions of Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, and Burma who supported US troops and were evacuated to the US after the Vietnam conflict).  Kowalski is a prejudiced bigot who loathes the presence of the (unnamable epithets) neighbors.  Next door is a family that includes a young loner boy Thao (Bee Vang) and his worldly sister Sue (Ahney Her) - two young people caught up in the Hmong world where the girls go to school and become employed and the boys go to jail.  Kowalski reluctantly befriends a gang threatened Thao and the neighborhood rewards him with endless gifts of flowers and food.  Gradually an event secures Kowalski's attachment to Thao and Kowalski grows to understand and respect 'the enemy' - people who are genuinely kind and loving despite Kowalski's personality and lonely bitter veteran's life.  The transformation of Walt Kowalski as played by Eastwood is genuinely touching and the way in which the movie ends is surprisingly sophisticated.There are moments in this bumpy script that are so trite and repetitive and stereotyped that the film becomes almost unwatchable.  But it is to the credit of the cast and Eastwood's direction that eventually the repeated verbal slurs of racial hatred make the resolution of the film even more powerful.  There are many lessons to be learned by listening and watching this film, not the least of which is insight into the psyches of war veterans from all wars.

Nothing could have prepared me for how awful this movie was in every regard...right down to inane ""special features.""  Eastwood is a hell of a director when he wants to be.  I can't imagine what attracted him to this After School Special script with its one-note characterizations and by-the-numbers plot development.There is nothing to recommend in this movie, but much to condemn, including atrocious acting by the supporting cast, including the priest and most especially the police officers at the end, who turned what should have been, in a good movie, a dramatic ending, into farce.Not a single subtle, genuine emotion to be found in the movie, the apotheosis of awfulness was reached when Eastwood looks at himself in the mirror and says that he has more in common with these [profanity profanity racial epithet...if you're sensitive to that kind of thing, be aware that every fifth sentence follows that form] people than I do my own family.  That's how little trust the script and direction had in the storytelling--the need was felt to smack the viewer right in the face with the point of the story.Finally, a word about the special feature...on cars.  Yes, the movie's title is ""Gran Tarino,"" and that's a car, and Eastwood's character had worked in Detroit making cars, and the car is in the movie in a couple of key scenes.  But this is not a movie about cars.  The eponymous wheels are if anything a symbol, but to have a feature about cars attend this DVD makes about as much sense as having a feature on sledding in a ""Citizen Cane"" DVD.I can't wait for Eastwood to return to form.  He is a smart director and a talented actor.  Fortunately, this is a rare misstep for him.  I can see why he was attracted to some of the messages in the script.

He has also one of the most prolific filmmakers around, and in 2008 he made two features.  Whereas many directors in Hollywood can take years between films, Clint cranks them out with ease.  He's done this a lot in his career (1997, 1975 for instance), and here, the two films, Changeling and Gran Torino, are excellent.Gran Torino is the better of Clint's 2008 films.This may turn out to be one of my favorite Clint movies, as it's a real surprise of a film.  It's funny, sad, tragic, uplifting, and fascinating, and Clint packs it all into a running time of two hours (it's shorter than most of his other films, which usually hit the 140 minute mark). Clint gives one of his most memorable performances as Walt Kowalski, a retired auto worker living in the Midwest who is a racist.  Through circumstance, he befriends one of his neighbors, a Hmong teenager, and helps him through his life, leading to a stunning conclusion, one of the most surprising and moving in all of Clint's work.This is one of Clint's most surprising films, funny and tender, filled with great cimenatography, funny dialogue (much of which is very un-PC, but it totally fits the story), intelligent situations, and, for the most part, excellent performances.  The two lead Hmong actors overact on occasion, but all of the other performances are first rate. The film is also very respectful of the Hmong culture itself, and I myself knew nothing about it until this film.  This film is also the biggest box office hit of Eastwood's career, which is really wonderful and a bit startling, if you think about it.  When I saw it in the theater, the show had sold out!  I can't remember the last time that happened (lucky for me, the theater added another show an hour later, so I didn't have to wait too long).  It reminds me of when Bob Dylan's Modern Times hit #1 a couple of years ago (and his recent album, Together Through Life, hit #1 as well).  Years ago who would have guessed that Eastwood would have a #1 hit in 2009, especially when you consider most, if not all, his contemporaries are playing caricatures of themselves, are doing mediocre supporting roles, or rehashing old roles.It was a crime that Eastwood didn't get major Oscar nominations for this film (or Changeling, except for Jolie).  I have always wondered what goes through the mind of Academy voters when they nominate and award mediocre films (like this year's Slumdog Millionare, a decent film but hardly a great motion picture), and shut out much more thought provoking, challenging, and entertaining films like Gran Torino.  This film has been compared to Paul Haggis's Crash, but in a way that shows Gran Torino is the far superior film about race relations.  Crash is a bloated, self important, and preachy film.  Most people agree that Gran Torino manages to say more about race relations and tolerance than the ridiculously PC, overblown film Crash (ironically enough, Paul Haggis wrote several films for Clint Eastwood, all of which are better than Crash).  Methinks that the Academy is jealous of Clint, in that he's first an artist, and a celebrity second, and he just makes great films.  He should have gotten something for this film.Eastwood keeps surprising us and himself, making excellent picture after excellent picture.  His last six films, Mystic River, Million Dollar Baby, Flags of Our Fathers, Letters from Iwo Jima, Changeling, and Gran Torino, have been a remarkable run, and I can't wait for the next Clint Eastwood film.",5,"The better of Clint's 2008 films, one of his most unusual films, and one of his best...",1245283200,"06 18, 2009",2009,3631,"['Clint', 'Eastwood', 'been', 'marvelous', 'filmmaker', 'entire', 'career', 'amaze', 'range', 'deep', 'artistry', 'also', 'one', 'most', 'prolific', 'filmmakers', '2008', 'made', 'two', 'features', 'Whereas', 'many', 'directors', 'Hollywood', 'can', 'take', 'years', 'films', 'Clint', 'out', 'ease', 'done', 'lot', 'career', '1997', '1975', 'instance', 'here', 'two', 'films', 'Changeling', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'are', 'excellent.Gran', 'Torino', 'better', 'Clint', '2008', 'films.This', 'may', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'one', 'favorite', 'Clint', 'movies', 'real', 'surprise', 'film', 'funny', 'sad', 'tragic', 'uplifting', 'fascinating', 'Clint', 'packs', 'running', 'time', 'two', 'hours', 'shorter', 'most', 'other', 'films', 'usually', 'hit', '140', 'minute', 'mark', 'Clint', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'performances', 'Walt', 'Kowalski', 'retired', 'auto', 'worker', 'living', 'Midwest', 'who', 'racist', 'circumstance', 'one', 'neighbors', 'Hmong', 'teenager', 'life', 'leading', 'stunning', 'conclusion', 'one', 'most', 'surprising', 'moving', 'Clint', 'work.This', 'one', 'Clint', 'most', 'surprising', 'films', 'funny', 'tender', 'filled', 'great', 'cimenatography', 'funny', 'dialogue', 'much', 'very', 'un-PC', 'totally', 'story', 'intelligent', 'situations', 'most', 'part', 'excellent', 'performances', 'two', 'lead', 'Hmong', 'actors', 'overact', 'occasion', 'other', 'performances', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'film', 'also', 'very', 'respectful', 'Hmong', 'culture', 'knew', 'nothing', 'film', 'film', 'also', 'biggest', 'box', 'office', 'hit', 'Eastwood', 'career', 'really', 'wonderful', 'bit', 'startling', 'think', 'When', 'saw', 'theater', 'show', 'had', 'sold', 'out', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'last', 'time', 'happened', 'lucky', 'theater', 'added', 'show', 'hour', 'later', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'wait', 'too', 'long', 'when', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'Modern', 'Times', 'hit', '1', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'recent', 'album', 'Together', 'Life', 'hit', '1', 'as', 'well', 'Years', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'guessed', 'Eastwood', 'would', 'have', '1', 'hit', '2009', 'especially', 'when', 'consider', 'most', 'not', 'contemporaries', 'are', 'playing', 'caricatures', 'are', 'doing', 'mediocre', 'supporting', 'roles', 'rehashing', 'old', 'roles.It', 'was', 'crime', 'Eastwood', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'major', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'film', 'Changeling', 'Jolie', 'have', 'always', 'wondered', 'what', 'mind', 'Academy', 'voters', 'when', 'nominate', 'award', 'mediocre', 'films', 'year', 'Slumdog', 'Millionare', 'decent', 'film', 'hardly', 'great', 'motion', 'picture', 'shut', 'out', 'much', 'more', 'thought', 'provoking', 'challenging', 'entertaining', 'films', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'film', 'been', 'compared', 'Paul', 'Haggis', 'Crash', 'way', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'far', 'superior', 'film', 'race', 'relations', 'Crash', 'bloated', 'self', 'important', 'preachy', 'film', 'Most', 'people', 'agree', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'say', 'more', 'race', 'relations', 'tolerance', 'ridiculously', 'PC', 'overblown', 'film', 'Crash', 'ironically', 'enough', 'Paul', 'Haggis', 'wrote', 'several', 'films', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'are', 'better', 'Crash', 'Methinks', 'Academy', 'jealous', 'Clint', 'first', 'artist', 'celebrity', 'second', 'just', 'great', 'films', 'should', 'have', 'gotten', 'something', 'film.Eastwood', 'surprising', 'making', 'excellent', 'picture', 'excellent', 'picture', 'last', 'six', 'films', 'Mystic', 'River', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'Flags', 'Fathers', 'Letters', 'Iwo', 'Jima', 'Changeling', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'have', 'been', 'remarkable', 'run', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'next', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'film']",Gran Torino

His one abiding passion is his somewhat unremarkable Gran Torino (GT) car - a survivor, like Clint himself, of better times.All this is fine as far as it goes, but when he switches momentarily into the tough guy role, he somehow comes over more as a tough old fart than anything else.  This is really stretching things a bit far.In fact, bearing in mind that Clint Eastwood, good as he has been in many roles, is not the kind of versatile actor that, say, Jack Nicholson is, does not really carry the character off with the same panache as Nicholson did in ""About Schmidt."" There you had a slightly similar idea of a ""senior citizen"" bearing all the inconvenience of age on his back, but with infinitely more subtlety and humour than Clint achieves. Whereas Schmidt was wholly believable and touching, Clint's character left me cold and unconvinced.If, however, you are a diehard Clint Eastwood fan, you won't be disappointed - as had been amply attested by most opinions on the film.

But Clint Eastwood is a man of epiphanies. So he works an epiphany out of this horror. His neighbors are from a Laotian tribe that fought with the Americans in Vietnam against the Communists. Circumstances bring the young boy of this family to trying to steal, on the order from a gang of young people of this community, the Gran Torino collectible car of our Kowalski. Of course he is interrupted and yet spared a bullet that would have killed him. Why? Because Kowalski had done that, had killed a young boy, one day in Korea and that crime is still haunting him. Circumstances will lead him to helping that boy and his sister out of difficult situations with that gang but also with some blacks. He does that on the spur of the moment and along the line of his long cultivated guilt that has to find a salvation after the death of his wife and the discovery that he is spitting blood and probably has lung cancer since he is a heavy smoker. The gang though does not take an intimidation for an answer and certainly not for a final and uncrossable warning. So they go further in their victimizing that boy and girl from next door, a lot farther, and Kowalski take the case in his own hands, at night when he is sure the whole nest of killing predators will be assembled and he comes out of the night, on their front lawn, with dozens of witnesses all around to provoke them into killing him, in fact over-killing him and thus freeing him from his guilt and his disease and at the same time bringing the whole gang down for quite a long time. The best part of this film is the giving away of his possession before and after his death. He dares give his silver star to the young Hmong boy Tao before dying,  and will his home to the church of the young Irish priest that had forced him into a sacrificial and Christian attitude and his Gran Torino to Tao again. Clint Eastwood in his old age seems to be cleaning up his own house and home, I mean his American mind and soul and that great Spring clearance takes the form of an admirable and at times compassionate or pathetic sidewalk confession and garage expiation. And that is so reassuring about the transformation that is taking place in the USA right now under our eyes, watered that it has been and still is by the blood of millions more victims, US or not, of two more wars in two more foreign countries that had asked nothing.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID",5,An epiphany can come at any time,1237680000,"03 22, 2009",2009,3039,"['Clint', 'Eastwood', 'confronts', 'power', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'lost', 'memory', 'crimes', 'Korean', 'War', 'generation', 'what', 'crime', 'have', 'transformed', 'racist', 'self-centered', 'extremely', 'bitter', 'person', 'who', 'become', 'recluse', 'self-righteous', 'expiation', 'past', 'expiation', 'color', 'total', 'rejection', 'anything', 'not', 'white', 'wrapped', 'up', 'American', 'flag', 'not', 'seeing', 'flag', 'shroud', 'shroud', 'basic', 'principles', 'United', 'States', 'America', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'man', 'epiphanies', 'epiphany', 'horror', 'neighbors', 'are', 'Laotian', 'tribe', 'fought', 'Americans', 'Vietnam', 'Communists', 'Circumstances', 'bring', 'young', 'boy', 'family', 'trying', 'steal', 'order', 'gang', 'young', 'people', 'community', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'collectible', 'car', 'Kowalski', 'course', 'interrupted', 'yet', 'spared', 'bullet', 'would', 'have', 'killed', 'Why', 'Kowalski', 'had', 'done', 'had', 'killed', 'young', 'boy', 'one', 'day', 'Korea', 'crime', 'still', 'haunting', 'Circumstances', 'will', 'lead', 'helping', 'boy', 'sister', 'difficult', 'situations', 'gang', 'also', 'blacks', 'spur', 'moment', 'line', 'long', 'cultivated', 'guilt', 'find', 'salvation', 'death', 'wife', 'discovery', 'spitting', 'blood', 'probably', 'lung', 'cancer', 'heavy', 'smoker', 'gang', 'not', 'take', 'intimidation', 'answer', 'certainly', 'not', 'final', 'uncrossable', 'warning', 'go', 'further', 'victimizing', 'boy', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'lot', 'farther', 'Kowalski', 'take', 'case', 'own', 'hands', 'night', 'when', 'sure', 'whole', 'nest', 'killing', 'predators', 'will', 'be', 'assembled', 'night', 'front', 'lawn', 'dozens', 'witnesses', 'provoke', 'killing', 'fact', 'over-killing', 'thus', 'freeing', 'guilt', 'disease', 'same', 'time', 'bringing', 'whole', 'gang', 'down', 'quite', 'long', 'time', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'giving', 'away', 'possession', 'death', 'give', 'silver', 'star', 'young', 'Hmong', 'boy', 'Tao', 'dying', 'will', 'home', 'church', 'young', 'Irish', 'priest', 'had', 'forced', 'sacrificial', 'Christian', 'attitude', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'Tao', 'again', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'old', 'age', 'be', 'cleaning', 'up', 'own', 'house', 'home', 'mean', 'American', 'mind', 'soul', 'great', 'Spring', 'clearance', 'form', 'admirable', 'times', 'compassionate', 'pathetic', 'sidewalk', 'confession', 'garage', 'expiation', 'so', 'reassuring', 'transformation', 'taking', 'place', 'USA', 'right', 'now', 'eyes', 'watered', 'been', 'still', 'blood', 'millions', 'more', 'victims', 'US', 'not', 'two', 'more', 'wars', 'two', 'more', 'foreign', 'countries', 'had', 'asked', 'nothing.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Versailles', 'Saint', 'Quentin', 'Yvelines', 'CEGID']",Gran Torino

1208946,A32ZKBXJJ45BRY,B001KVZ6ES,James Gallen,"[2, 2]","""Gran Torino"" is a different kind of Clint Eastwood movie.  Yes he still has a gun (you will have to see how he uses it) but his character is different from any that I have seen him play again.  In this movie, Eastwood plays the role of Walt Kowalski, an elderly, crotchety, widower, who, living with his legacy from the Korean War, gradually comes to terms with his ethnically changing, gang infested neighborhood.  Key characters include his Hmong neighbors, played by Bee Vang, Ahney Her and a young priest, played by Christopher Carley.  All turn in compelling performances as they slowly gain new understandings of those around them.  As the story progresses, Kowlaski moves from a not very likable old man to a personification of the Christ motif found so often in literature.  By the end, the viewer realizes that he is viewing a modern Morality Play.",5,A Modern Morality Play,1247788800,"07 17, 2009",2009,858,"['Gran', 'Torino', 'different', 'kind', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'movie', 'still', 'gun', 'will', 'have', 'see', 'how', 'character', 'different', 'have', 'seen', 'play', 'again', 'movie', 'Eastwood', 'role', 'Walt', 'Kowalski', 'elderly', 'crotchety', 'widower', 'who', 'living', 'legacy', 'Korean', 'War', 'gradually', 'terms', 'ethnically', 'changing', 'gang', 'infested', 'neighborhood', 'Key', 'characters', 'include', 'Hmong', 'neighbors', 'played', 'Bee', 'Vang', 'Ahney', 'Her', 'young', 'priest', 'played', 'Christopher', 'Carley', 'turn', 'compelling', 'performances', 'slowly', 'gain', 'new', 'understandings', 'story', 'Kowlaski', 'not', 'very', 'likable', 'old', 'man', 'personification', 'Christ', 'motif', 'found', 'so', 'often', 'literature', 'end', 'viewer', 'viewing', 'modern', 'Morality', 'Play']",Gran Torino
1208947,A1J5TC13BSPA2M,B001KVZ6ES,"James Simpson ""James Simpson""","[4, 4]","Clint Eastwood is probally the only man in his late seventies that could probally kick your arse. Let's face it. He's still a force to be reckoned with.One of cinema's greatest Tough Guy actors and the heir apparent to the mantle of the late John Wayne, Eastwood has carved a unique niche in cinema history.This film almost plays like an updating of the character he portayed as Dirty Harry Callahan in the 70s. A tough, hard edged man who was politically incorrect and did morally questionable things but seemed to always get the job done ,whatever that may be.His character is a war veteran who has just lost his wife. Besides still mourning demons of his violent past he must contend with severe loneliness brought on not just by the loss of his wife but by family alienation. His two sons seem to have no love for him and only use him. His grandkids, ditto. He has several predjudiced reservations about his own neighborhood as several Chinese immigrants move in that recall in his mind the enemy that he had fought and had warped his soul so much.To make matters worse, his street is surrounded by violent gangs that wreak mayhem for no discernible purpose. The cousin of one of the local gangsters has moved in to him next door. He's a young and shy kid who through fear and peer preasure is forced into attempting to steal Eastwood's Gran Torino car. The kid instead faces the barrel of Eastwood's M1 rifle!Interestingly, this is really where the film begins. Eastwood unintentionally becomes connnected to the family next door and learns something of there culture and is looked upon as a hero. The young man is ordered to work for him to erase his debt from the attempted theft and he becomes mentored by Eastwood. In many ways, Eastwood has discovered the family he never had. Unfortunately, his world is being threatened by escalating violence and this leads to a powerful resolution and the defintion of true heroism.Eastwood has always been known for making complex and interesting films and this one is no different. It's a surprisingly fast paced and short Drama that nonetheless remains more touching and memorable that virtually most films released today. It's a film that questions not just the concept of a hero but the concept of how and why we need them. It also is one of the few films to offer such biting commentary on the general apathy of today's generations with it's lack of morales and petty materialism. This is certainly NOT a Hollywood picture.Clint's acting is just abput as good as it gets. Only an actor of Eastwood's level of charisma could make such a racist and mean spirited character so loveable and funny. Eastwood's confrontations with the gangs throughout the picture are certainly highlights and are as fun as we'd expect. The film also offers Clint an opputunity to reflect on the right of violence, sort of like his Will Munny in 1992's ""Unforgiven"". His confession to a young Priest in the film and his ultimate sin and life regret is one of the actor's great screen moments and sums up the message of the film beautifully.Eastwood is supported by a fine cast including newcomer Bee Vang as ""Tao"", the youth who attempted to steal Clint's Gran Torino who becomes very much like his ""lost son"". His scenes with Clint are both humorous and moving. Christopher Carley's role as an insisitent young Priest also hist the right note and he plays off of Eastwood surprisngly well. Ahney Her is cute and likeable as the older sister of Tao and she is able to be one of the few people whos is able to empathize with Eastwood's cantankerous character.This film is overall incredibly well directed and acted while remaining consistently entertaining. First rate cinema all the way and a perfect bookend to the career of one of America's most significant artists.

He gives us one more take on the type in his portrayal of Walt Kowalski, a grumpy, bigoted Korean War vet. Kowalski has just lost his beloved wife and is a bitter and embattled man. His middle-aged sons are trying to move him out of the old neighborhood. His grandchildren are disrespectful, sullen teens. Chinese and Mexican gangs roam the once beautiful boulevards. And to top it all off, a family of Hmong has moved in next door.""Grand Torino"" could have become one of many clich&eacute;d Hollywood movies -- the old bigot who learns to appreciate the ways of the immigrant; the brave man who cleans out the town of varmints; the codger who finds meaning in mentoring wayward youth. The movie is all of these, but more. Eastwood seems anxious to play up to his past image as much as to play against it. He spits (a la Josie Wales) and tells tough guys to ""Go ahead"" (a la Dirty Harry). But the movie takes us in unexpected directions when a young priest (Christopher Carley) tries to break through the shell of this tough, grizzled fighter to mend the tender soul inside.Terrific performances by Ahney Her as the young teen who befriends Kowalski. Even peripheral roles are limed with deft lines. Kowalski's sons and their families have little screen time, but it is enough to sketch a lifetime of disappointments and misfired parenting. The movie includes loads of politically incorrect name calling (gooks, zipperheads, slopes), though it seems tolerable and even comical from a man of painful secrets like Kowlaski.All told, an engrossing tale that turns the Eastwood persona on its head while working it for all it's worth.",4,Like a well-tuned engine,1237680000,"03 22, 2009",2009,1691,"['Clint', 'Eastwood', 'milked', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'persona', 'years', 'one', 'more', 'take', 'type', 'portrayal', 'Walt', 'Kowalski', 'grumpy', 'bigoted', 'Korean', 'War', 'vet', 'Kowalski', 'just', 'lost', 'beloved', 'wife', 'bitter', 'embattled', 'man', 'middle-aged', 'sons', 'are', 'trying', 'move', 'old', 'neighborhood', 'grandchildren', 'are', 'disrespectful', 'sullen', 'teens', 'Chinese', 'Mexican', 'gangs', 'roam', 'once', 'beautiful', 'boulevards', 'top', 'off', 'family', 'Hmong', 'moved', 'next', 'door', 'Grand', 'Torino', 'could', 'have', 'become', 'one', 'many', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'old', 'bigot', 'who', 'appreciate', 'ways', 'immigrant', 'brave', 'man', 'who', 'out', 'town', 'varmints', 'codger', 'who', 'meaning', 'mentoring', 'wayward', 'youth', 'movie', 'more', 'Eastwood', 'anxious', 'play', 'up', 'past', 'image', 'as', 'much', 'play', 'la', 'Josie', 'Wales', 'tough', 'guys', 'Go', 'ahead', 'la', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'movie', 'unexpected', 'directions', 'when', 'young', 'priest', 'Christopher', 'Carley', 'break', 'shell', 'tough', 'grizzled', 'fighter', 'mend', 'tender', 'soul', 'inside.Terrific', 'performances', 'Ahney', 'Her', 'young', 'teen', 'who', 'Kowalski', 'Even', 'peripheral', 'roles', 'are', 'limed', 'deft', 'lines', 'Kowalski', 'sons', 'families', 'have', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'enough', 'sketch', 'lifetime', 'disappointments', 'misfired', 'parenting', 'movie', 'loads', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'name', 'calling', 'gooks', 'zipperheads', 'slopes', 'tolerable', 'even', 'comical', 'man', 'painful', 'secrets', 'Kowlaski.All', 'told', 'engrossing', 'tale', 'Eastwood', 'persona', 'head', 'working', 'worth']",Gran Torino

The kid next door is a doormat, but he show compassion for his neighbor. Tau's sister, is spunky and brave, and Walt learns to respect and like her. Walt gets pulled into their community because they need him and in turn he needs them. Food plays a key role in this movie like it does in most communities.All the acting is superb.

Some were good, some were so-so, some were outstanding. Before watching ""Gran Torino"" I had no idea what to expect. All I knew was it was about an aging Korean vet living in a neighborhood with Asians. A clash of cultures, prejudice and especially war memories. Eastwood's character doesn't respect Asians; in fact he hates every aspect of them as well as their culture. But he learns as he gets to know them. The friendship between Walt and the Asian boy develops as the movie progresses. I am not going to spoil the end of this gem of a movie but I want to say that the ending could make you feel sad, but it doesn't. Very weird but that's the magic of movie making and Eastwood proves yet again he's a pro before as well as behind the camera.I can't recall having enjoyed a simple movie like this over the past couple of years. It's a delight to watch. Yes, Clint is older, but he's not ready for a retirement home, meaning he can still kick butt (and does so)!

1208955,A1EARN5PUVIF1S,B001KVZ6ES,Jerry P. Danzig,"[1, 1]","By my reckoning (and as of this writing), this is Clint Eastwood's third masterpiece as a director and star.The first two were ""Unforgiven"" and ""Million Dollar Baby"".What's Clint's secret to making such outstanding films?Simple -- he doesn't give a fig for what some studio suits think will be commercial.  Instead he looks for a good script.The script for ""Gran Torino"", like U and MDB, is simply impeccable.  Yes, it's filled with vulgarity and racist language such as you may never have heard onscreen, but that doesn't diminish its command of story and character.The truth is, I wasn't very keen to see this movie when I saw the commercials.  Ho hum, Clint playing another crusty old codger.But then I saw an available copy of GT at my local Redbox kiosk and took it home.Like MDB, the film gets under your skin, and it had me bawling like a baby through the last half hour and crying some more the next day.To say this film is surprising and deeply moving is an understatement.  If you like great movies, you owe it to yourself to check this one out.I have deducted one star just because of the paucity of special features on the DVD -- no director's commentary, no behind-the-scenes making-the-film featurette, just some stuff about cars.I hope that this deficiency will be rectified soon with a better Collector's Edition...

1208956,A680RUE1FDO8B,B001KVZ6ES,Jerry Saperstein,"[1, 1]","Having appeared in practically every male oriented movie genre in his long career, Clint Eastwood has matured into one of the finest directors and actors the industry - and the public - have seen.Nearing 80, Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski, a character of roughly the same age. His wife has just died and Walt is living alone in his home of many years, the last Caucasian in a neighborhood that is suffering severely from ""diversity"". Kowalski retains the characteristics of the America he grew up in. He is an unrepentant racist, cursing his Hmong neighbors, the Latinos and blacks who, in his eyes, have destroyed his neighborhood. His is a rough camaraderie where ""real men"" zestfully hurl ethnic insults at each other.We quickly learn that Kowalski barely speaks with his two grown sons and their families. They have never, it seems, lived up to his expectations. A far too young and callow priest visits Kowalski, urging him to take confession because his late wife wanted him to. Kowalski reacts as you might expect.The next door neighbors are Hmongs. While Walt smokes his cigarettes and drinks his beer on the front porch, the Hmong grandmother glares at him, muttering insults in Hmong. Eastwood does the same in English.Kowalski spent three years fighting in Korea and we learn early through the explorations of his obnoxious grandchildren that he has some sort of medal from his service. He returned to work on the Ford assembly line for 50 years.Now he is alone. Old and alone. He has only his smokes, his beer and Jim Beam, his dog Daisy and his 1972 Ford Grand Torino.Next door live the Hmong family with two Americanized children, Sue, a girl in her later teens and Thao, who is something of a momma's boy. A Hmong gang wants Thao to join and isn't very gentle in its persuasion.Kowalski, belying his years, rescues Thao once and then his sister Sue, establishing himself as a hero in a neighborhood held hostage to the gangs.A reluctant friendship grows between Kowalski and the Hmong, particularly with the young Thao, to whom he becomes a mentor.Dramatic events pile up quickly and Kowalksi is clearly on a path with his destiny in his dreary Detroit suburb.Eastwood directed this magnificent film and his acting is superb. He has Kowalski's character down pat. Others may see the resonance between ""Gran Torino"" and John Wayne's last two films. Eastwood is aware of his aging and he plays the part as if it were real - perhaps because it is.I was uncomfortable with some parts, perhaps because it seemed to give up too much to ""diversity"" and ""multi-culturalism"" without asking some obvious questions. But I certainly can't fault the movie for that.In its own way, this film is as great as ""The Unforgiven"", not so much for the story (which is good) but because of Eastwood's direction and acting. He milks this story for all that it is worth - and that is a compliment.Jerry",5,"Superb Eastwood film, though I didn't like its ""touchy-feelyness:",1252800000,"09 13, 2009",2009,2891,"['Having', 'appeared', 'practically', 'male', 'oriented', 'movie', 'genre', 'long', 'career', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'matured', 'one', 'finest', 'directors', 'actors', 'industry', 'public', 'have', 'seen.Nearing', '80', 'Eastwood', 'Walt', 'Kowalski', 'character', 'roughly', 'same', 'age', 'wife', 'just', 'died', 'Walt', 'living', 'alone', 'home', 'many', 'years', 'last', 'Caucasian', 'neighborhood', 'suffering', 'severely', 'diversity', 'Kowalski', 'characteristics', 'America', 'grew', 'up', 'unrepentant', 'racist', 'cursing', 'Hmong', 'neighbors', 'Latinos', 'blacks', 'who', 'eyes', 'have', 'destroyed', 'neighborhood', 'rough', 'camaraderie', 'where', 'real', 'men', 'zestfully', 'hurl', 'ethnic', 'insults', 'other.We', 'quickly', 'learn', 'Kowalski', 'barely', 'two', 'grown', 'sons', 'families', 'have', 'never', 'lived', 'up', 'expectations', 'far', 'too', 'young', 'callow', 'priest', 'visits', 'Kowalski', 'urging', 'take', 'confession', 'late', 'wife', 'wanted', 'Kowalski', 'might', 'expect.The', 'next', 'door', 'neighbors', 'are', 'Hmongs', 'Walt', 'cigarettes', 'drinks', 'beer', 'front', 'porch', 'Hmong', 'grandmother', 'glares', 'muttering', 'insults', 'Hmong', 'Eastwood', 'same', 'English.Kowalski', 'spent', 'three', 'years', 'fighting', 'Korea', 'learn', 'early', 'explorations', 'obnoxious', 'grandchildren', 'sort', 'medal', 'service', 'returned', 'work', 'Ford', 'assembly', 'line', '50', 'years.Now', 'alone', 'Old', 'alone', 'only', 'smokes', 'beer', 'Jim', 'Beam', 'dog', 'Daisy', '1972', 'Ford', 'Grand', 'Torino.Next', 'door', 'live', 'Hmong', 'family', 'two', 'Americanized', 'children', 'Sue', 'girl', 'later', 'teens', 'Thao', 'who', 'something', 'momma', 'boy', 'Hmong', 'gang', 'Thao', 'join', ""n't"", 'very', 'gentle', 'persuasion.Kowalski', 'belying', 'years', 'rescues', 'Thao', 'once', 'then', 'sister', 'Sue', 'establishing', 'hero', 'neighborhood', 'held', 'hostage', 'gangs.A', 'reluctant', 'friendship', 'grows', 'Kowalski', 'Hmong', 'particularly', 'young', 'Thao', 'whom', 'mentor.Dramatic', 'events', 'pile', 'up', 'quickly', 'Kowalksi', 'clearly', 'path', 'destiny', 'dreary', 'Detroit', 'suburb.Eastwood', 'directed', 'magnificent', 'film', 'acting', 'superb', 'Kowalski', 'character', 'down', 'pat', 'Others', 'may', 'see', 'resonance', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'John', 'Wayne', 'last', 'two', 'films', 'Eastwood', 'aware', 'aging', 'part', 'were', 'real', 'perhaps', 'was', 'uncomfortable', 'parts', 'perhaps', 'seemed', 'give', 'up', 'too', 'much', 'diversity', 'multi-culturalism', 'asking', 'obvious', 'questions', 'certainly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fault', 'movie', 'that.In', 'own', 'way', 'film', 'as', 'great', 'Unforgiven', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'story', 'good', 'Eastwood', 'direction', 'acting', 'story', 'worth', 'compliment.Jerry']",Gran Torino

1208959,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B001KVZ6ES,J from NY,"[3, 3]","""Gran Torino"" is actor/director Clint Eastwood's best film, hands down.  The way he coordinates the demands of his increasing age with the remarkably bitter and yet deeply decent character, Walt Kowalski, reflects a man rigorously dedicated not only to his art but to making sense of the ruthless, ultra macho image that has been created around him since ""Dirty Harry"".Walt Kowalski is an embittered Korean veteran who lives in a bad area of Detroit with the Humungs, a group of Koreans who fought with the United States in Vietnam and relocated to various economically impoverished areas.  Walt liberally uses the terms gook, spook, dragon people, and an assorted list of racial epithets that fire off so easily one can't help be amused by them.  He's a man of a different generation and is not a ""value racist"": this is how he has emerged from warfare and 1950's Americana.Walt is in some ways like a ghost.  The values he cherishes--extreme masculinity, tribal patriotism, family, and even the proper way to approach the tabernacle in the Catholic Church--seem to be disappearing before his eyes.  His faith is also questionable at the beginning of the film. After his wife's funeral, he tells a young priest that he has no desire whatsoever to confess to an ""overeducated 27 year virgin who holds the hands of old women and promises them eternal life.""His Korean neighbors reciprocate his feelings of animosity.  There are parts of this fim that are drop dead funny because political correctness is dropped entirely.  Walt is not unlike the racist grandparents some of us have had, and if we have, we immediately feel a mix of repugnance and adoration for his absolute certitude in all situations.  Including putting an M-1 to the head of a gangster who steps on his lawn.Thao, a young Korean who lives near Walt, is pressured by his cousin to join the local gang.  After mistakenly trying to fit in with the gang and steal Walt's beloved Gran Torino, which he built himself,they see him as a punk but still insist he try another criminal act to be initiated into the gang.The rest of the film is a meditation on mortality, self sacrifice, and what it means to love another group of people regardless of race, ethnicity, or anything.

1208960,AB094YABX21WQ,B001KVZ6ES,J. Gregg,"[1, 2]","Eastwood has shown us many times before he understands the art of movie-making. That's why it's so confusing to see he was able to make such an embarrassing, almost amateuristic movie. Yes, in the beginning of the movie some of the over the top grumpy, racist, cynical one-liners are quite amusing, but then it just turns into an embarrassing spectacle of bad acting, bad writing, bad editing, just bad movie-making. The acting of the girl, and especially the boy next door are just gutwrenching to watch. My head was spinning by such a display of amateurism. I try to understand how on earth they could have ended up in an Eastwood movie. Are they his adopted children or children of friends or something? For sure he's doing somebody a huge favor to include them in the movie. Some of the scenes are really beyond bad. What's up with him connecting with the Asian kids by fixing the washing machine in the basement? The whole idea of the scene is stupid and embarrassing, let alone the execution of it. And than the scene when they are waiting for the girl, not sure what happened to her. Eastwood stares at his hand saying (something like) ""at least in Korea we were expecting to loose one of us"".... Can it get more cheesy than that? I didn't know whether I should laugh or cry. And than the scenes with the barber. The initial idea works out well and amusing - the barber and Eastwood doing their grumpy routine. But than they try and milk the idea and even introduce the boy (deprived of all acting skills) into their 'domain of real men' to teach him the way of Men (to curse). It just gets so embarrassing, you just want to leave the theater and get drunk to simply destroy the brain cells that stored the whole thing, to save you from uncomfortable flashbacks for the rest of your life.

1208961,A1C2FD1DZKR4W0,B001KVZ6ES,J. HARMON,"[1, 2]","I watched this movie on television this weekend and was moved to tears.Many people in this country (this world) beleive that bigotry and hatred are justified and justifiable. But never can a person be more deluded, unless people argue such bigotry and hatred as being a product of Godliness. Egads.Bigotry never stems from hatred toward others for their differences, bigotry and hatred eminates from individuals sense of self-loathing and inadequacy.Walt is an angry, hatred filled man whose attitudes helped shape and were further validated by, his dysfunctional dissonance toward life and living. Not being provided much context prior to his military service, one can only assume personality and behavior across the lifespan. However, Walt's military service alone is shown to be enough to cause great self-assuredness and egocentrism, while also creating the perpetuated myopic and callous racist and sexist views. The stern disciplinary behavior of a soldier is the fortitude and even arrogance presented by Walt, while the eternal burden of guilt of killing others create a complex, sympathetic character of an angry old man confronted by the meanings of life.His relationship with his own children is strained. Who is to blame is left to presumption, however considering his children's shallow, biggoted (elderly are feable people to take from and diminish through patronization) and estrangement, it is obvious within the film that they are far less sympathetic than the targets of Walt's venom and vitriole.Walt's strongest display of true confidence is when he locks away the vulnerable Thoa in his basement and avers that the greatest suffering that Thoa could ever experience would be that of killing another human being. Walt recognized that the enemey soldiers that he killed in battle were nothing more or less than he, frightened soldiers doing what they were ordered to do. They were human beings.More so, Walt's bigotry is confronted head on when he steps into a social ill beleiving that he is only protecting his own self interests (his property from the disturbance of tussling neighbors and idiotic gang members.) From his single act of selfish heroism, Walt is subjected to all of the trappings of a vastly disparate culture, one which is based less in individuality and more in social structure, respect for culture and all of the cultures vulnerabilities.With the help of a brazenly self-confident and enlightened young lady, Walt learns that life is not as it seems and that human beings (as opposed to cretins) are more complex and decent when viewed from various perspectives. What Walt previously interpreted as weakness and untrustworthiness, is in fact respectfulness and honor toward family. When that respect and honor is presented to Walt, he quickly recognizes some strengths within (such as good food) and opens his doors slightly to accept some of the fruits of the diverse culture. This is furthered by the opportunistic young lady who further educates Walt and (with the indentured help from the confused Thoa), shows that in truth, Walt ""has more in common"" with the odd characters that he has long loathed, than he has with his ""own family.""Thus, Walt not only begrudgingly changes his views, but his behaviors and ultimately sacrifices his own life in his one grand effort to make amends for all that has long tortured his soul... and to give life to someone else who is at the crossroads between good and evil (being pulled hardest from the dark side.)Ultimately, Walt shows that love is for the world entire... and that we are all far more alike than we are different. If we all could open our eyes and our hearts, push aside our fears and angers... we just might be able to defeat the hatred and corruption and live in peace for one another, instead of for ourselves (our fears and angers.)Thank you Clint Eastwood, for giving us GRAN TORINO.

1208966,A2B0DPQK20LYYJ,B001KVZ6ES,J. Michael,"[19, 65]","""Gran Torino"" is an emotionally satisfying, cathartic revenge movie of the Clint Eastwood genre. Clint stands up for the little guy against a bunch of bullies, the bullies retaliate brutally against Clint's weaker friend (Unforgiven?), after which Clint goes on the warpath and gives the bad guys their come-comeuppance. This type of movie is no less powerful for being predictable. Gran Torino is different in a couple of ways though. Firstly, in its characters and its setting, it has more texture than most movies of its type. Clint is the last White man in his once clean and safe Detroit neighborhood, now dominated by Hmong and blacks and is having a hard time dealing with the transformation. This is a situation that I don't recall being depicted by Hollywood before, and it is portrayed with great realism and grit. Secondly, this movie is different in that Clint's ultimate vengeance doesn't involve massacring all the bad guys, but in setting up his own murder so that the thugs are all arrested. So what's the problem with this movie?Clint's character is the victim of a historic injustice. In a neighborhood, a city and a country that he and his people built, he is now a stranger, living in a sea of criminals and parasitic foreigners imported into America by Teddy Kennedy's 1965 Immigration Act. The Democratic Party, with the cowardly complicity of the Republican Party and the ideological support of media and academia, have flooded America with non-White immigrants, to the point where Whites will be a minority in the U.S. by 2030. We didn't invite in foreigners based on their skill sets or personal character. So long as they were not White, it was ok with the Left so long as the hordes  undermined the dominance of Americans in their own country. The revolutionary and historical implications of this are obvious. No nation in history has ever voluntarily committed suicide. No nation in history has ever chosen to be conquered. Indeed, Americans never voted to give away our country to others, but that's still what's happening. We know what the Left called it when 19th century White men moved into African or Asian countries and took over the government. They call it colonialism, aggression, ethnic cleansing and genocide. When it's happening to 21st century White people in America and Europe, the Left calls it ""diversity"" and ""multiculturalism"". The implicit, and explicit, message of our Marxist masters is that White people need to die. Our continued existence is a bitter reminder of what America used to be: White, proud and strong. Therefore, we need to give away our neighborhoods, our cities, our country and our classic cars to our black, brown and yellow superiors and just die, while rejoicing in our destruction.It bears noting that this movie was written by a man named Schenk and produced by men named Gerber and Lorenz, along with Eastwood. Somehow, I think we'll be waiting in vain for a movie advocating the Right of Return for Palestinian refugees, extolling the glorious diversity that they would bring to Israel.",1,"Lesson of Gran Torino: Die, White Man.",1315612800,"09 10, 2011",2011,3062,"['Gran', 'Torino', 'emotionally', 'satisfying', 'cathartic', 'revenge', 'movie', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'genre', 'Clint', 'up', 'little', 'guy', 'bunch', 'bullies', 'bullies', 'retaliate', 'brutally', 'Clint', 'weaker', 'friend', 'Unforgiven', 'Clint', 'warpath', 'bad', 'guys', 'come-comeuppance', 'type', 'movie', 'less', 'powerful', 'being', 'predictable', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'different', 'couple', 'ways', 'Firstly', 'characters', 'setting', 'more', 'texture', 'most', 'movies', 'type', 'Clint', 'last', 'White', 'man', 'once', 'clean', 'safe', 'Detroit', 'neighborhood', 'now', 'dominated', 'Hmong', 'blacks', 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'dealing', 'transformation', 'situation', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'being', 'depicted', 'Hollywood', 'portrayed', 'great', 'realism', 'grit', 'Secondly', 'movie', 'different', 'Clint', 'ultimate', 'vengeance', ""n't"", 'involve', 'massacring', 'bad', 'guys', 'setting', 'up', 'own', 'murder', 'thugs', 'are', 'arrested', 'what', 'problem', 'movie', 'Clint', 'character', 'victim', 'historic', 'injustice', 'neighborhood', 'city', 'country', 'people', 'built', 'now', 'stranger', 'living', 'sea', 'criminals', 'parasitic', 'foreigners', 'imported', 'America', 'Teddy', 'Kennedy', '1965', 'Immigration', 'Act', 'Democratic', 'Party', 'cowardly', 'complicity', 'Republican', 'Party', 'ideological', 'support', 'media', 'academia', 'have', 'flooded', 'America', 'non-White', 'immigrants', 'point', 'where', 'Whites', 'will', 'be', 'minority', 'U.S.', '2030', 'did', ""n't"", 'invite', 'foreigners', 'based', 'skill', 'sets', 'personal', 'character', 'So', 'long', 'were', 'not', 'White', 'was', 'ok', 'Left', 'so', 'long', 'hordes', 'undermined', 'dominance', 'Americans', 'own', 'country', 'revolutionary', 'historical', 'implications', 'are', 'obvious', 'nation', 'history', 'ever', 'voluntarily', 'committed', 'suicide', 'nation', 'history', 'ever', 'chosen', 'be', 'conquered', 'Indeed', 'Americans', 'never', 'voted', 'give', 'away', 'country', 'others', 'still', 'what', 'happening', 'know', 'what', 'Left', 'called', 'when', '19th', 'century', 'White', 'men', 'moved', 'African', 'Asian', 'countries', 'took', 'government', 'call', 'colonialism', 'aggression', 'ethnic', 'cleansing', 'genocide', 'When', 'happening', '21st', 'century', 'White', 'people', 'America', 'Europe', 'Left', 'diversity', 'multiculturalism', 'implicit', 'explicit', 'message', 'Marxist', 'masters', 'White', 'people', 'need', 'die', 'continued', 'existence', 'bitter', 'reminder', 'what', 'America', 'used', 'be', 'White', 'proud', 'strong', 'Therefore', 'need', 'give', 'away', 'neighborhoods', 'cities', 'country', 'classic', 'cars', 'black', 'brown', 'yellow', 'superiors', 'just', 'die', 'rejoicing', 'destruction.It', 'bears', 'noting', 'movie', 'was', 'written', 'man', 'named', 'Schenk', 'produced', 'men', 'named', 'Gerber', 'Lorenz', 'Eastwood', 'Somehow', 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'waiting', 'vain', 'movie', 'advocating', 'Right', 'Return', 'Palestinian', 'refugees', 'extolling', 'glorious', 'diversity', 'would', 'bring', 'Israel']",Gran Torino

His role is more like the tough gunny from Heartbreak Ridge who is now a senior citizen.Okay, guns and fisticuffs are involved, but the film is so much more than that. Joining Mr. Eastwood in the film is Christopher Carley as Father Janovich, a determined priest who knows little of real life as lived by Korean war vet Kowalski; Ahney Her, entrancing as Sue Lor, the spirited Hmong girl next door who just won't let Kowalski continue living isolated and alone; and Bee Vang as Thao Vang Lor, called Toad by Kowalski who becomes his surrogate father and role model, teaching the young Hmong how American blue collar guys bond and behave.As the film opens, Kowalksi is in church for the funeral of his wife, a woman he characterizes later as the best woman in the country that he managed to catch. You won't catch Kowalksi moving into assisted living though his stereotypical sons would love to sell the family home in the old neighborhood and put him where they could justifiably say, ""He's being taken care of."" He's an embarrassment and an emotional anvil around their necks just as they are a puzzle to him.The trouble with the old neighborhood isn't that it's been taken over by Asians, but that the gangs - Asian, black, Hispanic - have a stranglehold on the decent people who are trying to find their piece of the American dream while still clinging to their traditions and values.Gran Torino isn't so much about knocking heads, defending the old neighborhood, and facing down gangbangers as it is about character growth and discovering that family doesn't necessarily mean the people you're related to by blood. Eastwood gives a layered performance that is worthy of Best Actor. In fact, there are several stellar performances in this film i.e. Carley's priest and unknown actors Ahney Her and Thao Vang Lor. Even Clint's son Scott Eastwood, credited in the film as Scott Reeves, is good in his role as the gutless Trey.The ending is surprising. And poignant. If you're an Eastwood fan, you'll love the film. If you abhor Eastwood, you'll be surprised how this film stays with you. I'm just surprised Eastwood didn't sweep all the major film awards. Awards don't make a film a classic.

1208969,AU7MW8YQQYHXX,B001KVZ6ES,"John A. Van Devender ""Gadfly""","[3, 8]","I do not know if Clint is saying adieu in this movie or not.  I would tend to think that he is because most of his acting in it consists of trademark scowls, ""make my day"" confrontations and other stock Eastwood mannerisms. It some ways it is a parody of all his previous flicks. If Clint was to say ""good bye"" this movie does for him what the Shootist did for John Wayne.The general features of the movie overlap the Shootist in several particulars:  both involve a crusty old guy with a violent past, both center on the relationship that develops between that guy and a young man whom he effectively teaches to be a man, both have the main character ill with a terminal disease (apparently in this movie) and both move toward the inevitable show down which the main character knows he will not survive.  This movie has a lot more street language.Now, what I really like about this movie is its intentional, in your face celebration of masculine, pre-Political Correctness, pre-sensitivity, pre- just about everything else, grittiness.  Eastwood is making a statement here about what we lost when modern sensibilities have reduced male role models for young men to the artificial ""either-or"" of wimpish angst ridden pretty boys or mean, crotch-gripping gangstas.  There used to be more of a continuum in male-ness and Eastwood reminds us of an era when ""being a man"" had certain cultural connotations.  A man helps a little old lady when she spills her groceries getting them out of the car.  It also, as well, meantsnarling at a punk as you pushed a 357 magnum into his face in the act of rescuing a young woman that was otherwise an object of bigoted contempt.So, compared to ""The Shootist"" this movie comes in a distant second but not without its own merit and value.

1208972,A9TG2NFA614S9,B001KVZ6ES,John F. Rooney,"[1, 6]","""Gran Torino"" begins with a grim, crusty, bigoted Clint Eastwood (Walt Kowalski) who has just become a widower. Living with him must have been an act of penance for his devoutly Catholic wife. A very persistent boyish-looking priest in his late twenties has promised Clint's wife that he'll get the old codger to confession.He has two sons and some grandkids who are self-centered, mean, and hateful, but they are also rubrics rather than real people. With a patriarch like Eastwood, it's little wonder they turned out so nasty.He lives in a well-kept single family home in a nice neighborhood that's been taken over by Southeast Asians (Hmongs). Clint's prize possessions are an antique Ford Gran Torino (he worked on the Ford Detroit assembly line for many years) and an M-1 rifle from his service in Korea.Over the years Eastwood's voice has grown hoarser, more gravelly, more strained and harder to distinguish. He's a dinosaur of the American film industry but still a national treasure.The plot is formulaic, melodramatic and predictable. Eastwood is gradually won over by his Asian neighbors, especially the son and daughter next door. He becomes a mentor for the son and has to prevent the boy from becoming prey for the local Asian gang. Eastwood at first resorts to his guns with vestiges of his Dirty Harry image coming to the fore.Eastwood has perfected a screen persona that is difficult for him to step out of. Even his walk is iconic. It probably would be better for him to let someone else direct a picture like this so it wouldn't turn into a star vehicle.The ending is a surprise in a movie that needs a jolt of originality.

We've all seen him in so many roles that have him playing a tough guy over the years - from his western movies, to Dirty Harry, to Escape From Alcatraz, to this movie, Eastwood always plays a badass tough guy and plays it well.  Clint Eastwood directed, produced and acted in the leading role in this movie.  Eastwood plays the role of Walter Kowalski, a retired factory worker and Korean War veteran who lives near Detroit.  He's old.  He's one of those old, crabby guys that's mad at the world.  He's a racist.  Or at least he starts out this movie as a racist.  His neighborhood has gone from being lilly white to multicultural and overrun by gangs.  His family doesn't have close relations with him.  He's very much alone.His young punk Hmong neighbor, Thao, tries to steal his 1972 Gran Torino out of his garage one night.  Kowalski catches him in the act, but Thao escapes.  The stunt was supposed to be for Thao's initiation into a local gang.  Walt realizes it was his neighbor Thao that tried to steal his car.  Kowalski calms down a bit and has Thao work for him to sort of redeem himself for the crime he almost committed.  The two become friends and from that point various bad things happen to Thao's family that are the result of being victimized by the gangs.  Kowalski's anger toward the gang boils over to the point where he personally wants to see to it that the gang pays for their crimes.  The gang's demise and destruction is Kowalski's ultimate goal.  In the process, his racism evaporates as the movie progresses.  I don't want to reveal the ending.  Watch this movie to see for yourself what happens.I like the character Eastwood plays.  He's rough around the edges, in declining health, hardened by war and his own neighborhood's decline.  He has a filthy mouth.  Only Clint Eastwood can deliver the lines he does in this movie and make them work.  They're so Clint Eastwood-esque.  I find his lines very humorous.

I am also impressed with the fact that this movie is not ""Politically Correct""; of coures I am talking about that term of endearment used in the movie: ""Zipperhead"". Political Correctness is killing this country. No one in this country can have an opinion or say anything without hurting someones elses feelings. Get a grip people!

1208981,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B001KVZ6ES,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[6, 8]","Even after watching Gran Torino for the third time I still believe it's the best film of 2008. It remains the most profound and heartwrenching moviegoing experience I've had with any film of 2008 and, beyond that, it's the rare kind of film that can truly make you laugh while simultaneously packing an emotional wallop. Despite a large box-office take and all sorts of accolades from moviegoers, the film escape any sort of awards for it's elderly leading man and poignant script. The Academy missed a real winner this year.Director Clint Eastwood stars as racist Korea veteran Walt Kowalski. The film opens at the funeral of Walt's wife, where he growls and sneers at the sight of his grandchildren and even his own grown children whom he views as disappointments. As one of his sons comment, ""Dad's still living in the '50s.""Walt lives in an area of Detroit populated by gangs of various demographics and next door lives a family of Hmong people. Thao (Bee Vang), one of Walt's neighbors, is pressured by a local gang to try and steal Walt's vintage, 1972 Gran Torino. Thao's attempted theft of the car is what, essentially, kickstarts the rest of the film in which Walt reluctantly grows to both like and appreciate the Hmong family next door.This poorly written synopsis sounds like the set-up for a typical movie exploring racism in the 21st century and it's consequences, but Gran Torino is thankfully much more than that.The film has many great scenes; Eastwood's ""get off my lawn"" line has already been immortalized but it is the lines that follow that are truly memorable. I, unfortunately, am unable to quote them here. Other scenes, like Walt confronting a trio of black men harassing Thao's sister and, of course, the ending come to mind, at least as a way of comparing the way the film balances humor and pathos.The ending packs one hell of a wallop although some people may see it as a sort of anticlimax. I was even disappointed with the ending briefly but it's really the most appropriate way for it to end. It's both beautiful and brilliant.There's nothing elaborate about the film; no showy cinematography, no elaborate set design. It's really a simple movie that is not without it's flaws. The scenes with Walt and Martin the barber (John Carroll Lynch) for example seem unrealistic and serve no real purpose beyond comic relief. As the scenes are quite amusing though, it's only a minor flaw.The other complaint I have is about the acting, particularly by those playing the Hmong characters. Much of it is very unsatisfactory and unconvincing. In fact, many of these actor's almost seem to reading off of far away cue cards.This is balanced out however by Eastwood, who has said this will be his final screen performance. He's a real revelation here. It could be argued that he does little more than growl, sneer, and spit venomous/humorous racial remarks and, yes, he does quite a bit of that. However, besides being very convincing, Eastwood can do more with a growl than some actors can do with an entire Shakespeare soliloquy. Despite the ignorance and overall bigotry of the character, Eastwood makes Walt human, sympathetic, and ultimately lovable. It's not only one of the best male lead performances of 2008, but one of Eastwood's all time greatest performances.Overall, Gran Torino is a great film in the purest sense of the word.

1208985,A3OP9CU8GUWI03,B001KVZ6ES,"J. Ridgway ""Ridge""","[1, 1]","One of Clint Eastwood's BEST films, and his least politically-correct (PC) film.  I think there's a correlation.  Another film he did (Letters from Iwo Jima) had its impact & quality definitely damaged by trying to be too PC.  In Gran Torino, Eastwood plays Walt, an old curmugeonly Korean War Vet who's about as least PC as any character I've witnessed in the movies.  He is definitely Old School, he is a retired auto worker, he jokes and curses a lot and he calls everybody by ethnic slurs.  He is growing old and he doesn't fit in with today's society any more.  He is estranged from his yuppie Son's family (his Son sells Toyotas and lives in the suburbs, and his Grandaughter is quite spoiled).  He packs an old 45 handgun to keep himself safe, well, because he lives in Detroit.  Walt's neighborhood is changing into Hmong immigrants and although Walt has quite the initial prejudice against them, he slowly starts accepting them after befriending neighbor Thao (a 18-ish Hmong boy, who initially tried to steal Walt's car after being pressured by a gang but then works for Walt to make up for it).  So Walt gradually feels more attached to his Hmong neighbor children than he does to his own family, and he gets pulled into their lives.  A big part of their lives is avoiding Hmong gangs, and Walt ends up being embroiled in their fight with the local gang.This film works on many levels.  It works on a dramatic level as the viewer identifies with Walt and becomes enmeshed in his life's struggles, as well as Thao's and Thao's sister.  It works on an emotional level as Walt brings out his past demons (from the war) and connects with Thao as if he were his own son.  It also works on a symbolic level, as Walt, the old white American, is slowly going downhill, as he sees his world changing around him, with some good (Asians working hard to rise out of poverty, become doctors etc), some bad (his complacent Son and bratty Granddaughter) and some appalling (Asian, Black and Latino gangs prowling Detroit's mean streets and fomenting violence).  And finally, it works on an acting level, as Eastwood plays a really good cranky old curmugeon!  (BTW Eastwood's son plays a pretty effective bit part as a local white kid trying to act cool in order to escape violence from some local street thugs.)It's yet another in a line of vigilante movies, but more human and involved than, say, Death Wish, and with a powerful dramatic twist at the end.  Being non-PC, it is very effective and does not pull punches.  But it is artistic as well -- the theme song played at the end, written by Eastwood & performed by Jamie Cullem is haunting and beautiful.

Jameson, taken from the product reviewIf you are Clint Eastwood, you can make a movie how it should be made. As grand, iconoclastic Dirty Harry, Eastwood stood up for those who would make America better and stronger. As Walt Kowalski, he fiercely faces down a neighborhood gang and rescues young Thao, brother of Sue, his sassy new Hmong friend and neighbor.This is the point where Eastwood becomes Walt--racist, mouth filled with racial epithets spilled forthrightly on the objects of his racism. But it is not a purposeful racism, just one of habit and habitat. As with any meaningful exchange with those different from us, he begins to see that the Hmongs are people--and Americans, as he is, but in a different cultural context. It is actually liberating for Walt to make this connection (he doesn't have one with his sons and their families).My first thought after seeing this movie was disappointment mixed with respect. ""Gran Torino"" did not produce the thrill I expected, but instead delivers compassion and redemption and sacrifice, inestimable values in the big picture of Life. Ol' Walt had more in common with the priest's boss than first meets the eye.I wondered why Eastwood specifically chose Hmongs to be his neighbors (were they initially scripted in?). Developing genuine concern, compassion, and finally affection for his neighbors, Walt shows how Archie Bunker could have been 20 years down the road of American cultural dynamics.This, I thought, was Eastwood's purpose. America is changing; let's acknowledge it, accept it, and embrace this change. How my heart swelled with respect and fondness for this new icon--a Walt embracing his own mortality by acceptance and finally redemption.This is a remarkable movie--Judy Polhemus.",5,A strong cultural statement,1244764800,"06 12, 2009",2009,1791,"['remarkable', 'movie', 'Richard', 'T.', 'Jameson', 'taken', 'product', 'reviewIf', 'are', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'can', 'make', 'movie', 'how', 'should', 'be', 'made', 'grand', 'iconoclastic', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'Eastwood', 'stood', 'up', 'who', 'would', 'make', 'America', 'better', 'stronger', 'Walt', 'Kowalski', 'fiercely', 'down', 'neighborhood', 'gang', 'rescues', 'young', 'Thao', 'brother', 'Sue', 'sassy', 'new', 'Hmong', 'friend', 'neighbor.This', 'point', 'where', 'Eastwood', 'Walt', 'racist', 'mouth', 'filled', 'racial', 'epithets', 'spilled', 'forthrightly', 'objects', 'racism', 'not', 'purposeful', 'racism', 'just', 'one', 'habit', 'habitat', 'meaningful', 'exchange', 'different', 'see', 'Hmongs', 'are', 'people', 'Americans', 'different', 'cultural', 'context', 'actually', 'liberating', 'Walt', 'make', 'connection', ""n't"", 'have', 'one', 'sons', 'families', '.My', 'first', 'thought', 'seeing', 'movie', 'was', 'disappointment', 'mixed', 'respect', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'did', 'not', 'produce', 'thrill', 'expected', 'instead', 'delivers', 'compassion', 'redemption', 'sacrifice', 'inestimable', 'values', 'big', 'picture', 'Life', 'Ol', 'Walt', 'had', 'more', 'common', 'priest', 'boss', 'first', 'eye.I', 'wondered', 'why', 'Eastwood', 'specifically', 'chose', 'Hmongs', 'be', 'neighbors', 'were', 'initially', 'scripted', 'Developing', 'genuine', 'concern', 'compassion', 'finally', 'affection', 'neighbors', 'Walt', 'how', 'Archie', 'Bunker', 'could', 'have', 'been', '20', 'years', 'road', 'American', 'cultural', 'dynamics.This', 'thought', 'was', 'Eastwood', 'purpose', 'America', 'changing', 'let', 'acknowledge', 'accept', 'embrace', 'change', 'How', 'heart', 'swelled', 'respect', 'fondness', 'new', 'icon', 'Walt', 'embracing', 'own', 'mortality', 'acceptance', 'finally', 'redemption.This', 'remarkable', 'movie', 'Judy', 'Polhemus']",Gran Torino

Urban ""U2fan4ever76""","[3, 3]","Clint Eastwood has become an icon, not just for his iconic film roles over the very long career he has had, but also for his outstanding directing. Ironically enough, the movies where he is the director AND main actor, are the ones that shine the most. (Example. ""Pale Rider"" and ""Unforgiven"")""Gran Torino"" is expertly directed and acted by Eastwood and brings that classic touch that only he can do. His character, ""Walt"", is not likeable at all in the beginning and many may feel that way even through the end. He is an angry man, mad at the world and all of the problems the world has caused him. He is a veteran of the Korean war--a war the U.S. lost. He is a recent widower and his two sons and their families have little to do with him unless they need something. His neighborhood is deteriorating around him. He is a racist, pure and simple, non-apologetic about it.With all of that said, you might wonder if there is anything redeeming about the character of ""Walt"" or the movie. A resounding, yes. The movie traces ""Walt"" as he goes from being that grumpy old man in the neighborhood who doesn't want to have a thing to do with his neighbors, particularly the Asian ones living next door, to being the same grumpy old man, but mellowing out as he befriends the Asian teenager and his sister next door.While his own family doesn't need him and views him somewhat as a burden or annoyance, the Asian family next door needs him to help with getting an Asian gang from leaving them alone. ""Walt"" sees a young teenager who has potential and knows that he needs to help him out with some tough love and being like a big brother. The scenes are classic and enduring. The chemistry between Eastwood and the actors who portray brother and sister is spot on.The pacing of the movie is good and you are never bored. I was always excited as to see what would happen next and Eastwood didn't disappoint.Many might find the movie as not politically correct and I think that is a good thing. Political correctness has its place, I guess, but in movies, I don't see a reason. Eastwood's character was shaped by a hard life and war and he doesn't mince words and tells it like it is. It is one of his best acting performances by far in recent years.Overall, ""Gran Torino"" is fine Hollywood filmmaking at its best. You will thoroughly enjoy this movie and yes the title is a reference to Eastwood's character's car which has underlying significance to the story.4/5 stars",4,Clint Eastwood At His Best Directing and Acting,1244678400,"06 11, 2009",2009,2462,"['Clint', 'Eastwood', 'become', 'icon', 'not', 'just', 'iconic', 'film', 'roles', 'very', 'long', 'career', 'had', 'also', 'outstanding', 'directing', 'Ironically', 'enough', 'movies', 'where', 'director', 'AND', 'main', 'actor', 'are', 'ones', 'shine', 'most', 'Example', 'Pale', 'Rider', 'Unforgiven', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'expertly', 'directed', 'acted', 'Eastwood', 'classic', 'touch', 'only', 'can', 'do', 'character', 'Walt', 'not', 'likeable', 'beginning', 'many', 'may', 'feel', 'way', 'even', 'end', 'angry', 'man', 'mad', 'world', 'problems', 'world', 'caused', 'veteran', 'Korean', 'war', 'war', 'U.S.', 'lost', 'recent', 'widower', 'two', 'sons', 'families', 'have', 'little', 'do', 'need', 'something', 'neighborhood', 'deteriorating', 'racist', 'pure', 'simple', 'non-apologetic', 'it.With', 'said', 'might', 'wonder', 'anything', 'redeeming', 'character', 'Walt', 'movie', 'resounding', 'yes', 'movie', 'Walt', 'being', 'grumpy', 'old', 'man', 'neighborhood', 'who', ""n't"", 'want', 'have', 'thing', 'do', 'neighbors', 'particularly', 'Asian', 'ones', 'living', 'next', 'door', 'being', 'same', 'grumpy', 'old', 'man', 'mellowing', 'out', 'Asian', 'teenager', 'sister', 'door.While', 'own', 'family', ""n't"", 'need', 'views', 'somewhat', 'burden', 'annoyance', 'Asian', 'family', 'next', 'door', 'help', 'getting', 'Asian', 'gang', 'leaving', 'alone', 'Walt', 'young', 'teenager', 'who', 'potential', 'help', 'out', 'tough', 'love', 'being', 'big', 'brother', 'scenes', 'are', 'classic', 'enduring', 'chemistry', 'Eastwood', 'actors', 'who', 'portray', 'brother', 'sister', 'spot', 'on.The', 'pacing', 'movie', 'good', 'are', 'never', 'bored', 'was', 'always', 'excited', 'see', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'next', 'Eastwood', 'did', ""n't"", 'disappoint.Many', 'might', 'find', 'movie', 'not', 'politically', 'correct', 'think', 'good', 'thing', 'Political', 'correctness', 'place', 'guess', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'reason', 'Eastwood', 'character', 'was', 'shaped', 'hard', 'life', 'war', ""n't"", 'mince', 'words', 'one', 'best', 'acting', 'performances', 'far', 'recent', 'years.Overall', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'fine', 'Hollywood', 'filmmaking', 'best', 'will', 'thoroughly', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'yes', 'title', 'reference', 'Eastwood', 'character', 'car', 'underlying', 'significance', 'story.4/5', 'stars']",Gran Torino

This film is none other than the recently released ""Gran Torino"", which Clint directed and also starred in, possibly in his final onscreen performance. Just like so many of his other films, ""Gran Torino"" is yet another instant classic from Clint Eastwood, a man of so many talents and a true living legend among Hollywood.""Gran Torino"" is the story of a Korean War veteran named Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood), who despite his intense prejudices remains in the house he shared for so many years with his wife, even though the neighborhood has seen a vast influx of Asian-American homeowners. In spite of his disdain for his neighbors, Walt soon finds himself inadvertently saving the life of one of the local teenagers who is being threatened by an Asian gang after he failed to steal Walt's beloved Gran Torino. As hard as he tries to fight it, Walt begins to realize that perhaps he may have more in common with his Asian neighbors, despite their vast cultural differences and his pervasive bigotry, than he would ever care to admit.As one of the most accomplished and iconic actors and/or filmmakers working in Hollywood, with numerous films to his credit, it's a wonder that Clint can still manage to make a film in which he actually may top himself. Yet, with his terrific performance in this film, I believe Clint has given us one of the best performances of his extremely successful career, if not the best. He imbues his character with such subtle nuances, and an irresistible grandfather-like quality despite his abrasive disposition that you can't help but like the guy; while at the same time, his mere presence on screen demands our attention and respect. I never believed any actor could make this kind of character so entertaining and likeable, but Clint figured out how to do it, and has succeeded brilliantly.Speaking of performances, the supporting cast for ""Gran Torino"" was comprised of mostly newcomers to film. I'm referring to the actors chosen to portray the various Hmong characters that live in the neighborhood that Walt resides in. Leading these cast members are two fairly talented young actors Bee Vang (as Thao) and Ahney Her (as Sue), both of their characters' interactions with Walt serve as the primary crux on which the majority of the story rests. Surprisingly, Bee and Ahney do very well with their roles providing an authenticity to their struggle for acceptance in a culture that they don't fully understand and vice versa, while at the same time attempting to reach out to a man who has spent the majority of his life despising those who are different. The remainder of the supporting cast was not focused upon in the film nearly as much as the previous two, yet it would be a disservice to them to not mention that they all delivered very solid, and seemingly genuine performances to further enhance the richness of the overall film.However, if I had to complain about anything in this movie, there is one performance that is weaker than the others. The one in question would be actor Bee Vang, who seemed a bit unsure of himself in places, and at times he would clearly over-emphasize a line reading, causing his character's dialogue to sound out of place with the other actor(s) in the scene. Although when all is said and done, if Clint Eastwood didn't have a problem with Bee's performance in order to make him change it, then who am I to judge.A few moments back I mentioned that Clint Eastwood was one of the most accomplished actors and filmmakers in Hollywood, and that perhaps he has actually bested himself with his performance here in ""Gran Torino""; yet, I never mentioned whether I thought his directing accomplished the same achievement. As refined as Clint's directing has become over the many years since 1971, when he first decided to step behind the camera, I don't know if I can say that ""Gran Torino"" is any better than his previous efforts from that perspective.One thing that is for certain about Clint's directing, it's that he never shies away from hitting the audience hard with an emotional, visceral, or visual impact, and ""Gran Torino"" is no exception. In this respect he is uncompromising, which is undoubtedly one of the many attributes that has made him such a powerful directing force to be reckoned with over the last few decades. Even though he has the courage to go for the audience's gut, when lesser men would pull back out of fear that the audience may be turned off, Clint has come to the understanding that you don't always have to show everything for the full power of the moment to be felt in a scene; which is something that so many other directors would do well to take a lesson in from this living legend.It's been rumored that ""Gran Torino"" marks Clint's final onscreen appearance, and that the remainder of his career will be served behind the camera. If that is true, then this is definitely a powerful curtain call from the actor, and one he should definitely be proud of.""Gran Torino"" is rated R for violence and language.",5,This is Vintage Clint

Of course, it's just a movie, so it did take some artistic license; but the human element it tried to show, the story it tried to tell, was shown and told well. The finishing solo by Eastwood was also very good--possibly the most tender part of the movie. I am giving it five stars.

But Gran Torino may just be Clint Eastwood's finest acting, and it certainly one of the best films he's directed. It's both iconic - building on Dirty Harry and Unforgiven - and subtle. As an actor friend of mine once said back in the late 1970's about Clint: ""He's got one look. But boy, is it a good look.""Gran Torino is the embodiment of that statement. When Clint levels his rifle at the scum, and says he could blow their heads off, go in, and sleep like a baby, he's probably the only man on earth you'd believe saying something like that. His eyes, his carriage, his intensity.Underneath that patented Dirty Harry glare is a performance of such subtlety, minute inflections, and being it's virtuoso. He's like a worn out pair of jeans, a well-oiled and used baseball mitt. Clint Eastwood uses his entire body of work as a back drop to this performance, and builds on it to take us along for the ride.I'm not going to share the plot as others have so far. It's a film about values and tradition. About accountability. Doing the right thing - up to and including making sure his old dog is taken care of. What's masterful about the film is that he takes what could have been a caricature in the hands of another actor and director and makes it believable.Much has been made of his racist language. At first it's jarring. It's so all encompasing and over the top in the beginning of the film you can't help but concentrate on it. But he takes it from Archie Bunker territory with character development and plot arc to the point where you no longer actually hear the stupid words. You are too focused on the man's character and who he really is. A real racist would never have entered his neighbor's home, and certainly wouldn't have eaten their food. The reviewer who said he's racist because he doesn't know any other way to be is spot-on.The Hmong cast is outstanding. I especially loved the interaction between Walt and Grandma - two peas in a pod. Bee Vang as Tow was solid as the boy who becomes a man. Ahney Her as Sue is the driver of the changes in Walt. If she couldn't hold her own with Clint the film wouldn't have worked. She does, and in the bargain, Gran Torino is a very satisfying, impressive film.Like Gran Torinos, and Clint Eastwood, they don't make 'em like this anymore.",5,Not About the Car or Racism Either,1245456000,"06 20, 2009",2009,2367,"['175', 'reviews', 'read', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'reading', 'mine', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'finest', 'acting', 'certainly', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'directed', 'iconic', 'building', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'Unforgiven', 'subtle', 'actor', 'friend', 'mine', 'once', 'said', 'back', 'late', '1970', 'Clint', 'got', 'one', 'look', 'boy', 'good', 'look', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'embodiment', 'statement', 'When', 'Clint', 'levels', 'rifle', 'scum', 'could', 'blow', 'heads', 'go', 'sleep', 'baby', 'probably', 'only', 'man', 'earth', ""'d"", 'believe', 'saying', 'something', 'eyes', 'carriage', 'intensity.Underneath', 'patented', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'glare', 'performance', 'such', 'subtlety', 'minute', 'inflections', 'being', 'virtuoso', 'worn', 'pair', 'jeans', 'well-oiled', 'used', 'baseball', 'mitt', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'entire', 'body', 'work', 'back', 'drop', 'performance', 'builds', 'take', 'along', 'ride.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'share', 'plot', 'others', 'have', 'so', 'far', 'film', 'values', 'tradition', 'accountability', 'Doing', 'right', 'thing', 'up', 'including', 'making', 'sure', 'old', 'dog', 'taken', 'care', 'What', 'masterful', 'film', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'caricature', 'hands', 'actor', 'director', 'believable.Much', 'been', 'made', 'racist', 'language', 'first', 'jarring', 'so', 'all', 'encompasing', 'top', 'beginning', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'concentrate', 'Archie', 'Bunker', 'territory', 'character', 'development', 'plot', 'arc', 'point', 'where', 'no', 'longer', 'actually', 'hear', 'stupid', 'words', 'are', 'too', 'focused', 'man', 'character', 'who', 'really', 'real', 'racist', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'entered', 'neighbor', 'home', 'certainly', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'eaten', 'food', 'reviewer', 'who', 'said', 'racist', ""n't"", 'know', 'other', 'way', 'be', 'spot-on.The', 'Hmong', 'cast', 'outstanding', 'especially', 'loved', 'interaction', 'Walt', 'Grandma', 'two', 'peas', 'pod', 'Bee', 'Vang', 'Tow', 'was', 'solid', 'boy', 'who', 'man', 'Ahney', 'Her', 'Sue', 'driver', 'changes', 'Walt', 'could', ""n't"", 'hold', 'own', 'Clint', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'worked', 'bargain', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'very', 'satisfying', 'impressive', 'film.Like', 'Gran', 'Torinos', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', ""'em"", 'like', 'anymore']",Gran Torino

Clint Eastwood is a kinda older Dirty Harry persona, with a little bit of Archie Bunker in him--he is not a policeman this time.  He is actually a retired car salesman and former soldier.  The movie begins at his wife's funeral.  He stands in the church, assessing his relatives.  They are just not up to his expectations (granddaughter with piercings and belly hanging out, etc.).  Clint is definitely a character.  He tells it like it is and has a biting sarcastic way of doing it.  He saw his share of ""action"" as a Korean War veteran, and is not afraid to stand up to people.  He has guns, too.  Clint has a Hmong (Vietnamese) family living next to him and they become part of the story line, as they eventually become friends.  Clint also stands up to gangbangers and tries to help some neighborhood folks out.  There is also a young, baby-faced Catholic priest that pesters the heck out of Clint because Clint's wife had asked the priest to look after Clint before she went to the other side.  I cannot tell you anymore without ruining the story for you, but it is a great storyline with fine acting.  And you know Clint is one of those actors that can say more than words with just a look.

1209012,A356RFKNIG043B,B001KVZ6ES,K. Swanson,"[4, 5]","Gran Torino was a surprisingly emotional experience for me, both due to it being one of Eastwood's most affecting and human movies, and because my Dad loved Clint and we used to see all his films together. Clint has made some real classics, and this ranks with any of them in its own unique way.Schenk's script keeps getting better as the film moves along; the opening scene is almost ham-handed exposition, telling us everything we need to know right away instead of showing it. That's the weakest moment of the film, though, and as we dig into Walt's character Clint informs him with many perfect and telling details, visually and verbally. Eastwood is totally inside this role, an absolutely masterful performance that should have won the Oscar hands down, and his direction is equally crisp. Rarely has a director acted so well, and vice-versa.There are many perfect moments here, from Walt's family trying to make sure they're in his will but never spending time with him, Walt's exchanges with his barber, his love of his talismanic Torino, and above all his growing love towards his Hmong neighbors. One of the best things about the blu-ray version is the extra doc about making the movie, a very fine little piece with some great Clint interviews that makes clear how careful he was to get all the cultural details right in this (very rare) cinematic look at Hmong culture in the US.Here we see a very mature Eastwood, in all the best ways. Dirty Harry has progressed into the sort of quietly loving being that was his destiny all along, and I believe that's what my Dad always loved about Clint: under all that toughness and edge is a truly intelligent and compassionate man who knows that the underdog is oft worth fighting for, and that the values we carry in our hearts are what define us in our most difficult times. The old Clint revenge motif is as usual in full force, but this time there's more soul in it than is sometimes the case, and the unexpected ending truly makes it clear that Dirty Harry and the Man With No Name have learned a lot in the past four decades.We've been watching plenty of films this very hot summer (thank goodness there's no global warming! It would really be hot, not just 105 most every day for the past month), and this is one of the only ones I can recall where about halfway in I suddenly hoped the movie would never end. I wanted to see Walt grow and develop; Clint's performance is just that good, certainly one of his best.There is also a lot of wonderfully wry humor, especially if you know any semi-bigots who are deep down very just and decent people. Clint's not afraid to poke fun at himself or Archie Bunkers or anything else by this point, and there are some hilarious lines that come out of nowhere. Walt's little grunts say more than any dialogue. I don't think Walt would ever say ""colored guy"", but Clint's knowing that the N-word would unnecessarily offend a lot of folks makes that line acceptable if unrealistic in this context. It's one of the film's few odd moments but doesn't detract at all.The music is also very fine, simple but moving, and Eastwood's son Kyle (what a great name, another sign of Clint's genius) has progressed a lot in the last 20 years. If Clint's basic but heartfelt singing over the credits doesn't bring tears to your eyes, you're a stronger man than I, and welcome to it. When Clint makes you cry you know something special has happened; this is a long way from Detective Callahan and even Unforgiven, another masterpiece.But the best thing here is the growth of Clint's love for Thao and Sue, his young Hmong neighbors who show him more real love than his own family. The bond between Walt and Thao is one of the more touching screen relationships I have ever seen, and it really becomes affecting as the film evolves. Wonderful acting from both of these hitherto unknown players makes this movie glow with a feeling unlike anything Eastwood has ever done, and it's seeing one of our great American film heroes become Walt so completely that makes this movie truly special.I had no idea this film would be anywhere near this fine, and rarely have I missed my Dad more since his death. He would have loved Gran Torino in so many ways, and I can't recommend enough that any fathers and sons out there see this film together. It has a lot to say about men and how we relate to each other and ourselves. It made me realize yet again that my old man knew what was up in many ways that only getting older can reveal to me, and that I sure was lucky to have him for a father. Any film that can bring that home so forcefully, and with so much laughter amongst the pathos, is nothing other than a true classic.This movie will live a long life and eventually be seen as one of the finest of our era. It's a fitting end to Eastwood's stellar career, one of the American cinema's most interesting. Or is it the end? Clint, man of many surprises, may still have one or two up his sleeve....Not bad for a 78-year-old old man.",5,Sure wish I could have watched this with my old man,1248825600,"07 29,

1209014,A2T049UQONS0OY,B001KVZ6ES,Larry VanDeSande,"[2, 4]","Clint Eastwood's ""Gran Torino"", named for the 1972 Ford his character helped construct during his days as an auto assembler that also has a starring role in the movie, is another in the line of films Eastwood has produced, directed and starred in that address people whose lives lack fulfillment and meaning until they make significant changes and sacrifices. The movie reminded me most of 2002's ""About Schmidt"", Jack Nicholson's moving and contemporary study of a man whose life lacks meaning until he does somethings completely new and rewarding that redefines his moribund existence.While it is indeed an intense character study, the manifest content of ""Gran Torino"" is more akin to ""Grand Canyon"", where the 21st century urban realities of racism, gangs, lowlifes and interrace relationships creates a kettle of stew we've seen on celluloid many times before. What separates this from others of its ilk is Eastwood's splendid acting as Walt Kowalski, an old world retiree living among immigrants in what is clearly an old Detroit neighborhood -- maybe Hamtramck, one of Detroit's most rundown areas that once was home to thousands of Polish immigrants.Kowalksi, like Schmidt, begins his trek to salvation in retirment by losing his wife. For Schmidt, this opened new possibilities. For Kowalski, it seemed to extinguish possibilities, driving him further into a self-imposed existence where little more than beer, his dog, his little slice of yard and home, and his beloved car mean anything. A man that never really got on with his children, grandchildren, his church or anyone in his neighborhood, Kowalski becomes almost completely isolated from this world and exhibits ongoing anger and resentment toward it.His re-engagement in his community comes through a relationship with neighbors, a group of Hmong immigrants and first generation Americans that arrived via the Vietnam war, and his engagement in their personal lives and problems. It is from this perspective the Kowalski eventually find fulfillment and salavation for his own life of estrangement.I found personal parallels in Kowalski's characterization to my own father, a World War II veteran who came home and rarely discussed the war with me. While Kowalski's memories of Korea are horrifying, my dad, too, found the war too difficult to talk about. And, while Kowalski at first rejected the overtures of his priest to help him recover from both his wife's death and his life of self-imposed torture, my dad also rejected God and faith until late in life, when he told my mother there might be something to it. Kowalski found his religious conversion differently, as you'll see when you watch this film.""Gran Torino"" demonstrates the benchmark characteristics people love in Eastwood's contemporary films: multidimensional characters you care about, stepped storylines that move seamlessly from one objective to the next, and all the human emotions people go to the movies to see, hear and feel -- laughter, drama, humor, heartbreak and tragedy. It is often so much like real life it is easy to suspend disbelief for 125 minutes during ""Gran Torino"". I am not a sentimental person but I nearly cried at the apothosis of this film, during the critical scene where Eastwood reaches salvation. I haven't cried during a movie since seeing ""Old Yeller"" as a boy. This was a touching, marvelously wrought conclusion to a story of one man's mission to find meaning and purpose in a life devoid of both.I'm sure this film will recieve Oscar and other award considerations. I haven't been a great fan of Eastwood's late films such as ""Unforgiven"", ""Million Dollar Baby"", ""Mystic River"" and ""Flags of Our Fathers"", all of which either won Oscars or were nominated for them. To me, critics saw more in these films than I saw and they were uniformly overrated. I don't question they are all fine films, but the greatest of their years? Not to me. Since 2009 just started, it's hard to imagaine where ""Gran Torino"" will stack up among this year's films but certainly, I think, it is at least as good as those I've mentioned that came before it, putting it in apparently excellent company.",4,About a life restored and salvation,1232236800,"01 18, 2009",2009,4148,"['Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'named', '1972', 'Ford', 'character', 'helped', 'construct', 'days', 'auto', 'assembler', 'also', 'starring', 'role', 'movie', 'line', 'films', 'Eastwood', 'produced', 'directed', 'starred', 'address', 'people', 'lives', 'lack', 'fulfillment', 'meaning', 'make', 'significant', 'changes', 'sacrifices', 'movie', 'reminded', 'most', '2002', 'Schmidt', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'moving', 'contemporary', 'study', 'man', 'life', 'meaning', 'somethings', 'completely', 'new', 'rewarding', 'moribund', 'indeed', 'intense', 'character', 'study', 'manifest', 'content', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'more', 'akin', 'Grand', 'Canyon', 'where', '21st', 'century', 'urban', 'realities', 'racism', 'gangs', 'lowlifes', 'interrace', 'relationships', 'kettle', 'stew', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'celluloid', 'many', 'times', 'before', 'What', 'others', 'ilk', 'Eastwood', 'splendid', 'acting', 'Walt', 'Kowalski', 'old', 'world', 'retiree', 'living', 'immigrants', 'what', 'clearly', 'old', 'Detroit', 'neighborhood', 'maybe', 'Hamtramck', 'one', 'Detroit', 'most', 'rundown', 'areas', 'once', 'was', 'home', 'thousands', 'Polish', 'immigrants.Kowalksi', 'Schmidt', 'trek', 'salvation', 'retirment', 'losing', 'wife', 'Schmidt', 'opened', 'new', 'possibilities', 'Kowalski', 'seemed', 'extinguish', 'possibilities', 'driving', 'further', 'self-imposed', 'existence', 'where', 'little', 'more', 'beer', 'dog', 'little', 'slice', 'yard', 'home', 'beloved', 'car', 'mean', 'anything', 'man', 'never', 'really', 'got', 'children', 'grandchildren', 'church', 'anyone', 'neighborhood', 'Kowalski', 'almost', 'completely', 'isolated', 'world', 'exhibits', 'ongoing', 'anger', 'resentment', 'it.His', 're-engagement', 'community', 'relationship', 'neighbors', 'group', 'Hmong', 'immigrants', 'first', 'generation', 'Americans', 'arrived', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'engagement', 'personal', 'lives', 'problems', 'perspective', 'Kowalski', 'eventually', 'find', 'fulfillment', 'salavation', 'own', 'life', 'estrangement.I', 'found', 'personal', 'parallels', 'Kowalski', 'characterization', 'own', 'father', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'veteran', 'who', 'came', 'home', 'rarely', 'discussed', 'war', 'Kowalski', 'memories', 'Korea', 'are', 'horrifying', 'dad', 'too', 'found', 'war', 'too', 'difficult', 'talk', 'Kowalski', 'first', 'rejected', 'overtures', 'priest', 'help', 'recover', 'wife', 'death', 'life', 'self-imposed', 'torture', 'dad', 'also', 'rejected', 'God', 'faith', 'late', 'life', 'when', 'told', 'mother', 'might', 'be', 'something', 'Kowalski', 'found', 'religious', 'conversion', 'differently', ""'ll"", 'see', 'when', 'watch', 'film', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'benchmark', 'characteristics', 'people', 'love', 'Eastwood', 'contemporary', 'films', 'multidimensional', 'characters', 'care', 'stepped', 'storylines', 'move', 'seamlessly', 'one', 'objective', 'next', 'human', 'emotions', 'people', 'go', 'movies', 'see', 'hear', 'feel', 'laughter', 'drama', 'humor', 'heartbreak', 'tragedy', 'often', 'so', 'much', 'real', 'life', 'easy', 'suspend', 'disbelief', '125', 'minutes', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'am', 'not', 'sentimental', 'person', 'nearly', 'cried', 'apothosis', 'film', 'critical', 'scene', 'where', 'Eastwood', 'salvation', 'have', ""n't"", 'cried', 'movie', 'seeing', 'Old', 'Yeller', 'boy', 'was', 'touching', 'marvelously', 'wrought', 'conclusion', 'story', 'one', 'man', 'mission', 'find', 'meaning', 'purpose', 'life', 'devoid', 'both.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'film', 'will', 'recieve', 'Oscar', 'other', 'award', 'considerations', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'great', 'fan', 'Eastwood', 'late', 'films', 'such', 'Unforgiven', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'Mystic', 'River', 'Flags', 'Fathers', 'won', 'Oscars', 'were', 'nominated', 'critics', 'saw', 'more', 'films', 'saw', 'were', 'uniformly', 'overrated', 'do', ""n't"", 'question', 'are', 'fine', 'films', 'greatest', 'years', 'Not', '2009', 'just', 'started', 'hard', 'imagaine', 'where', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'will', 'stack', 'up', 'year', 'films', 'certainly', 'think', 'least', 'as', 'good', ""'ve"", 'mentioned', 'came', 'putting', 'apparently', 'excellent', 'company']",Gran Torino

1209018,A163N66ALZDACR,B001KVZ6ES,LBloom,"[0, 0]","I've been a long time fan of Eastwood's and I can honestly say that this is amongst my favorites. It is certainly much more satisfying than ""Million Dollar Baby"" at least in my book and definitely above ""Bloodwork"". It's not ""Unforgiven"" or ""Dirty Harry"". All of those to varying degrees were escapist fodder. Escaping into the old west or the streets of San Francisco can be pleasurable. ""Gran Torino"" has moments that harkens back to William Money or Harry Callahan but only moments. Those are probably the moments seen in the previews. This movie surprised me with its combination of drama and humor and compassion in dealing with sensitive subjects like aging, death, racism, religion and a re-evaluation of a person's values; to come to peace with inner demons that have tormented someone and finding peace within one's self. The characters flawed enough so that there is no preachy message here or anything and doesn't pretend to be some sensitive film about any of it's subject, but instead deals with them rather harshly actually.There is plenty of humor to be found herein as Walt Kowalski, Polish-American veteran of the Korean War, retired auto plant worker and now a widower faces the change of having to deal with things changing in his life. Kowalski never misses a chance to get in a racial slur and even as his son drives away after the wife's funeral, Kowalski noticing the make of the son's vehicle mutters,"" Why can't you buy American?"" and inside the vehicle the son Mitch's comments are about the predictability of dad's racist outlook on things. And speaking of racism there is a heavy dose of this elsewhere as well.Walt's neighbors are Hmong people whose son is harassed by a group of thugs wanting to initiate him into their gang so as to protect him from a rival Mexican gang. Thao Vang Lor is assigned the task of stealing Kowalski's prize possession from his days at the Ford plant, a mint condition 1972 Ford Gran Torino. Thao botches his assignment and the gang show up to give Thao a second chance. When he refuses that gang becomes violent and Kowalski is awakened by the shouts and the sounds of yard ornaments being knocked over and broken. Walt armed with his shotgun isn't afraid of the gang or their ""f"" word vocabulary. The gang backs off and retreats and Walt becomes an unwilling hero to the Hmong's whether he likes it or not. Only Thao and his sister, Su speak any English so Walt is unable to communicate to the other relatives that he just wanted to left alone. After being smothered with flowers and trays of Hmong delicacies, Thao's mother, Vu forces Thao to confess to Walt about his attempted car theft. Su, translating for Vu explains that Thao must atone for his deed by working for Walt. Walt reluctantly becomes sort of father figure to Thao even getting him a job in construction and loaning him tools, but Thao's cousin from the street gang and friends have other ideas and brutally beat Thao one day while heading home from work. Su also is rescued from some black thugs by Walt and expresses her gratitude by making Walt a regular dinner guest. Meanwhile, Walt goes after one of the gang the beat up Thao and leaves him beaten and bruised with a warning to leave Thao alone. The gang retaliates, opening fire on the front of the Vang Lor's house with automatic weapons, and beating and raping Su.The end has Walt finally coming to terms with his racism and other demons. Thao assumes that Walt will go after the gang for what they did to Su and that he will be along for the ride. Walt forbids this and locks him in the basement. The end is a fatal shoot out with Walt as the victim and the gang is placed under arrest.The gist of this is that Walt has never told anyone that he was dying of tuberculosis. He is seen visiting a clinic and coughing up blood on several occasions. He dies for a cause and settles his demons regarding the things he did in the war which have haunted him all of his life and are the underlying reason for his bitterness. He resents being a hero for things he didn't want to do in the first place. This may seem a bit contrived but it flows well and ties up all of the loose ends nice and neatly and even gives you some things to think about as well.This isn't the greatest movie that Eastwood has ever done. But it may serve as the final chapter in all of those ""aged"" character movies that he's been putting out since ""Unforgiven. The aging gunfighter(Unforgiven), aging thief (Absolute Power), aging news reporter (True Crime), aging secret service agent (In The Line of Fire) and so forth. This seems to be sort of the culmination and final chapter of that series of movies the same common thread. This, however, does deserve a place amongst Eastwood's best and most original movies.",5,Change of Pace Movie,1299024000,"03 2, 2011",2011,4771,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'long', 'time', 'fan', 'Eastwood', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'amongst', 'favorites', 'certainly', 'much', 'more', 'satisfying', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'least', 'book', 'definitely', 'Bloodwork', 'not', 'Unforgiven', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'varying', 'degrees', 'were', 'escapist', 'fodder', 'Escaping', 'old', 'west', 'streets', 'San', 'Francisco', 'can', 'be', 'pleasurable', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'moments', 'back', 'William', 'Money', 'Harry', 'Callahan', 'only', 'moments', 'are', 'probably', 'moments', 'seen', 'previews', 'movie', 'surprised', 'combination', 'drama', 'humor', 'compassion', 'dealing', 'sensitive', 'subjects', 'aging', 'death', 'racism', 'religion', 're-evaluation', 'person', 'values', 'come', 'peace', 'inner', 'demons', 'have', 'tormented', 'someone', 'finding', 'peace', 'one', 'self', 'characters', 'flawed', 'enough', 'so', 'preachy', 'message', 'here', 'anything', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'be', 'sensitive', 'film', 'subject', 'instead', 'deals', 'rather', 'harshly', 'plenty', 'humor', 'be', 'found', 'herein', 'Walt', 'Kowalski', 'Polish-American', 'veteran', 'Korean', 'War', 'retired', 'auto', 'plant', 'worker', 'now', 'widower', 'change', 'having', 'deal', 'things', 'changing', 'life', 'Kowalski', 'never', 'chance', 'get', 'racial', 'slur', 'even', 'son', 'away', 'wife', 'funeral', 'Kowalski', 'noticing', 'make', 'son', 'vehicle', 'mutters', 'Why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'buy', 'American', 'vehicle', 'son', 'Mitch', 'comments', 'are', 'predictability', 'dad', 'racist', 'outlook', 'things', 'speaking', 'racism', 'heavy', 'dose', 'elsewhere', 'well.Walt', 'neighbors', 'are', 'Hmong', 'people', 'son', 'harassed', 'group', 'thugs', 'wanting', 'initiate', 'gang', 'so', 'protect', 'rival', 'Mexican', 'gang', 'Thao', 'Vang', 'Lor', 'assigned', 'task', 'stealing', 'Kowalski', 'prize', 'possession', 'days', 'Ford', 'plant', 'mint', 'condition', '1972', 'Ford', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'Thao', 'assignment', 'gang', 'show', 'up', 'give', 'Thao', 'second', 'chance', 'When', 'gang', 'violent', 'Kowalski', 'awakened', 'shouts', 'sounds', 'yard', 'ornaments', 'being', 'knocked', 'broken', 'Walt', 'armed', 'shotgun', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'gang', 'f', 'word', 'vocabulary', 'gang', 'retreats', 'Walt', 'unwilling', 'hero', 'Hmong', 'not', 'Only', 'Thao', 'sister', 'Su', 'speak', 'English', 'Walt', 'unable', 'communicate', 'other', 'relatives', 'just', 'wanted', 'left', 'alone', 'being', 'smothered', 'flowers', 'trays', 'Hmong', 'delicacies', 'Thao', 'mother', 'Vu', 'Thao', 'confess', 'Walt', 'attempted', 'car', 'theft', 'Su', 'translating', 'Vu', 'Thao', 'must', 'atone', 'deed', 'working', 'Walt', 'Walt', 'reluctantly', 'sort', 'father', 'figure', 'Thao', 'even', 'getting', 'job', 'construction', 'loaning', 'tools', 'Thao', 'cousin', 'street', 'gang', 'friends', 'have', 'other', 'ideas', 'brutally', 'beat', 'Thao', 'one', 'day', 'heading', 'home', 'work', 'Su', 'also', 'rescued', 'black', 'thugs', 'Walt', 'gratitude', 'making', 'Walt', 'regular', 'dinner', 'guest', 'Meanwhile', 'Walt', 'one', 'gang', 'beat', 'up', 'Thao', 'beaten', 'bruised', 'warning', 'leave', 'Thao', 'alone', 'gang', 'opening', 'fire', 'front', 'Vang', 'Lor', 'house', 'automatic', 'weapons', 'beating', 'raping', 'Su.The', 'end', 'Walt', 'finally', 'coming', 'terms', 'racism', 'other', 'demons', 'Thao', 'Walt', 'will', 'go', 'gang', 'what', 'did', 'Su', 'will', 'be', 'along', 'ride', 'Walt', 'basement', 'end', 'fatal', 'shoot', 'Walt', 'victim', 'gang', 'placed', 'arrest.The', 'gist', 'Walt', 'never', 'told', 'anyone', 'was', 'dying', 'tuberculosis', 'seen', 'visiting', 'clinic', 'coughing', 'up', 'blood', 'several', 'occasions', 'cause', 'demons', 'regarding', 'things', 'did', 'war', 'have', 'haunted', 'life', 'are', 'underlying', 'reason', 'bitterness', 'being', 'hero', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'do', 'first', 'place', 'may', 'seem', 'bit', 'contrived', 'well', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'nice', 'neatly', 'even', 'things', 'think', 'well.This', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'movie', 'Eastwood', 'ever', 'done', 'may', 'serve', 'final', 'chapter', 'aged', 'character', 'movies', 'been', 'putting', 'out', 'Unforgiven', 'aging', 'gunfighter', 'Unforgiven', 'aging', 'thief', 'Absolute', 'Power', 'aging', 'news', 'reporter', 'True', 'Crime', 'aging', 'secret', 'service', 'agent', 'Line', 'Fire', 'so', 'forth', 'be', 'sort', 'culmination', 'final', 'chapter', 'series', 'movies', 'same', 'common', 'thread', 'however', 'deserve', 'place', 'amongst', 'Eastwood', 'best', 'most', 'original', 'movies']",Gran Torino

1209023,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B001KVZ6ES,Linda Linguvic,"[5, 6]","This film, directed by and starring Clint Eastwood, is nothing short of a delightful gift to those of us who have loved Clint Eastwood through the years.  Here, he plays the role of a nasty old Korean War veteran who thinks like it's still the 1950s and is angry all the time.  His wife has just died, his two sons don't respect him and his granddaughter wears a belly ring and wants his vintage 1972 Gran Torino car which he, himself, assembled when he worked in a Ford plant many years before.  Also, a young-fresh faced Catholic priest keeps hounding him to go to confession.Clint lives alone in a neighborhood that is fast becoming multicultural and he hates his Hmong neighbors which he refers to as ""gooks.""  But things change when he catches the teenager, Thao, from next door trying to steal his prized automobile.  The teen's sister, Sue, convinces Clint to let the boy work off his debt and soon a begrudging respect seems to soften Clint a little as he see how hard the boy works.The neighborhood is rife with gang warfare and drive-by shootings are common.  So is the constant recruitment of the gangs for new members and the Hmong gang wants Thao.  Clint starts to train Thao for a job in the construction industry so that he doesn't have to join the gang and this leads to some of the funniest scenes in the film as he tries to teach Thao to ""act like a man"" and throw ethnic insults at everyone.  Thao becomes his prot&eacute;g&eacute; and Clint becomes friendly with the Hmong family, especially when the women keep bringing him food.Soon, though there is a crisis and Clint, who we soon discover is probably dying, must prove himself as a hero.  I knew he would do something but was surprised at the complexity of the conclusion, which made the film work as a whole and ended in an extremely satisfying way.I loved this film.

Original review deleted by Amazon, along with 100 other reviews of Gran Torino.Throughout his illustrious acting career, Clint Eastwood has delivered a series of iconic characters, such as The Man with no name, Dirty Harry, Josie Wales, and Will Munny in Unforgiven.Throughout his illustrious directing career he has delivered outstanding movies such as Unforgiven, Mystic River, and Million Dollar Baby, for which he has won five Academy Awards, for best Picture, Best Director, and including the Irving Thalberg Life Achievement Award.The actors who have worked with him have been blessed with Oscar: Gene Hackman for Unforgiven, Tim Robbins and Sean Penn for Mystic River, Morgan Freeman and Hilary Swank for Million Dollar Baby.In Gran Torino he both directs and acts, and delivers an acting performance that will be remembered long after the final credits roll, in its unique way, as memorable as any other character he has created.Gran Torino is the second best movie I have seen this year. Not just for the acting, not just for the directing, but for the storytelling, and the emotional journey on which it takes you, the laughter, the feeling of being gripped, and its more surprising moments.In the opening scenes, we have the exposition of the character. We get to know Walt Kowalski, by how people act around him, and his seemingly hateful attitude towards people. More is conveyed through a scowl, and a snarl than with words. When the mischievous grandchildren go through his stuff in the basement, we see the Silver Star he won in Korea. There are three other important symbols in the movie, the lighter, the gun, and the car.We see a hero with a warrior past, a patriot who fought for a cause greater than himself. Clearly, his bigotry stems from those experiences.He's not just mean, he's 'get of my lawn' mean. He's Dirty Harry 'Go ahead punk, make my day!,' mean.His dead wife's priest bugs him to hear his confession, at her request. The priest in a way is his wife's conscience.When he snarls down the barrel of his rifle, at the neighborhood punk: 'I could blow your head off, and sleep like a baby,' you get the sense that he means it.So, with all that happens, we see the change in his decision making, from someone reluctant to be involved in his neighbor's affairs, and a story can turn on something as random as looking at an empty beer cooler.For all his faults, Walt has mature masculine character. Even though he is a difficult father, he has taught his children character. So, when he sees the boy next door lacks character, and a strong male role model, he takes him under his wing, and teaches him how to be a man.The scenes where the boy practises Walt's high octane ball busting banter, are the funniest in the movie. Through knowing Walt, he makes decisions he never would have made by himself. In so doing, Walt finds meaning and purpose, and a chance for redemption, and the boy becomes a man.The Academy's actor awards tend to go to actors in two types of role:1.Psychopath- No Country for Old Men, The Usual Suspects, There Will Be Blood, Training Day, Silence of the Lambs.2.Mentally Disabled, Social or Physical Handicap, overcomes great adversity or discrimination- Shine, As Good as It Gets, A Beautiful Mind, Ray, Scent of a Woman, Capote, Philadelphia, The Pianist, A Beautiful Life.Every rule has an exception. Russell Crowe in Gladiator played a character with thematic similarities to Walt.For a 78 year old man to direct and be lead actor in a movie of this caliber is an achievement worthy at the very least of being nominated for the highest award for Acting, Directing or both.I hope you find this review helpful.",5,It's not about the car,1326499200,"01 14, 2012",2012,3745,"['Originally', 'posted', 'January', '2009', 'Original', 'review', '810', 'helpful', 'votes', '865', 'Original', 'review', 'deleted', 'Amazon', '100', 'other', 'reviews', 'Gran', 'Torino.Throughout', 'illustrious', 'acting', 'career', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'delivered', 'series', 'iconic', 'characters', 'such', 'Man', 'name', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'Josie', 'Wales', 'Will', 'Munny', 'Unforgiven.Throughout', 'illustrious', 'directing', 'career', 'delivered', 'outstanding', 'movies', 'such', 'Unforgiven', 'Mystic', 'River', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'won', 'five', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Director', 'including', 'Irving', 'Thalberg', 'Life', 'Achievement', 'Award.The', 'actors', 'who', 'have', 'worked', 'have', 'been', 'blessed', 'Oscar', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'Unforgiven', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Mystic', 'River', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby.In', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'directs', 'acts', 'delivers', 'acting', 'performance', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'long', 'final', 'credits', 'roll', 'unique', 'way', 'as', 'memorable', 'other', 'character', 'created.Gran', 'Torino', 'second', 'best', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'year', 'Not', 'just', 'acting', 'not', 'just', 'directing', 'storytelling', 'emotional', 'journey', 'laughter', 'feeling', 'being', 'gripped', 'more', 'surprising', 'moments.In', 'opening', 'scenes', 'have', 'exposition', 'character', 'get', 'know', 'Walt', 'Kowalski', 'how', 'people', 'act', 'seemingly', 'hateful', 'attitude', 'towards', 'people', 'More', 'conveyed', 'scowl', 'snarl', 'words', 'When', 'mischievous', 'grandchildren', 'go', 'stuff', 'basement', 'see', 'Silver', 'Star', 'won', 'Korea', 'are', 'three', 'other', 'important', 'symbols', 'movie', 'lighter', 'gun', 'car.We', 'see', 'hero', 'warrior', 'past', 'patriot', 'who', 'fought', 'cause', 'greater', 'Clearly', 'bigotry', 'experiences.He', 'not', 'just', 'mean', ""'get"", 'lawn', 'mean', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'ahead', 'punk', 'make', 'day', 'mean.His', 'dead', 'wife', 'priest', 'bugs', 'hear', 'confession', 'request', 'priest', 'way', 'wife', 'conscience.When', 'snarls', 'down', 'barrel', 'rifle', 'neighborhood', 'punk', 'could', 'blow', 'head', 'sleep', 'baby', 'get', 'sense', 'it.So', 'see', 'change', 'decision', 'making', 'someone', 'reluctant', 'be', 'involved', 'neighbor', 'affairs', 'story', 'can', 'turn', 'something', 'as', 'random', 'looking', 'empty', 'beer', 'cooler.For', 'faults', 'Walt', 'mature', 'masculine', 'character', 'Even', 'difficult', 'father', 'taught', 'children', 'character', 'So', 'when', 'boy', 'next', 'door', 'lacks', 'character', 'strong', 'male', 'role', 'model', 'wing', 'how', 'be', 'man.The', 'scenes', 'where', 'boy', 'Walt', 'high', 'octane', 'ball', 'busting', 'banter', 'are', 'funniest', 'movie', 'knowing', 'Walt', 'decisions', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'so', 'doing', 'Walt', 'meaning', 'purpose', 'chance', 'redemption', 'boy', 'man.The', 'Academy', 'actor', 'awards', 'tend', 'go', 'actors', 'two', 'types', 'role:1.Psychopath-', 'No', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'Training', 'Day', 'Silence', 'Lambs.2.Mentally', 'Disabled', 'Social', 'Physical', 'Handicap', 'overcomes', 'great', 'adversity', 'discrimination-', 'Shine', 'As', 'Good', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'Ray', 'Scent', 'Woman', 'Capote', 'Philadelphia', 'Pianist', 'A', 'Beautiful', 'Life.Every', 'rule', 'exception', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Gladiator', 'played', 'character', 'thematic', 'similarities', 'Walt.For', '78', 'year', 'old', 'man', 'direct', 'be', 'lead', 'actor', 'movie', 'caliber', 'achievement', 'worthy', 'very', 'least', 'being', 'nominated', 'highest', 'award', 'Acting', 'Directing', 'both.I', 'hope', 'find', 'review', 'helpful']",Gran Torino

It gets into how the cities male demographic go to jail showing they think crime is the only way to get by and some find it cool. It revolves around a pretty biast clint eastwood and his relationship with a neighborhood teen Tao. After Tao steals his car Eastwood or his character Walt takes his offer and makes him work for him. At first walt dislikes tao but they grew into having a friendship. Its a deeply emotional film that requires your full attention.

1209030,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,B001KVZ6ES,magellan,"[2, 2]","Please note that I saw this movie on HBO so I can't comment on the video quality.Gran Torino is perhaps both Eastwood's best movie and his best acting performance yet. He plays a crusty, grumpy, hardened Korean War veteran who doesn't take you know what from anybody. He brings a brooding, smoldering intensity to the character of a retired, working-class white man who doesn't like how his neighborhood has been taken over by various minorities and gangs over the years, becoming crime ridden and the homes falling into disrepair. In fact, he seems to be the only white guy left. But despite his racist feelings, he dislikes bullies and senseless violence even more, and when he comes to the aid of the neighboring Hmong boy when he's victimized by the local Asian gang, he unwittingly and unwillingly becomes a hero to the boy and his family.Eastwood strikes up an awkward friendship with the boy, and teaches him the old fashioned values he grew up with: hard work, self-reliance, independence, discipline, and integrity, values that he sees very little in evidence in his now fallen neighborhood. The scene where he teaches the boy ""to talk like a man"" is one of the funniest scenes I've seen in any movie, so despite the overall serious tone of the movie, it's not without its humorous moments too. Overall, it's a remarkable performance and movie from Eastwood and a fitting cap to a great career. Even if he retires after this he will have gone out at the top of his game. Not many people who are still working at age 78 can say that.",5,Perhaps his best,1260662400,"12 13, 2009",2009,1541,"['Please', 'note', 'saw', 'movie', 'HBO', 'ca', ""n't"", 'comment', 'video', 'quality.Gran', 'Torino', 'perhaps', 'Eastwood', 'best', 'movie', 'best', 'acting', 'performance', 'yet', 'crusty', 'grumpy', 'hardened', 'Korean', 'War', 'veteran', 'who', ""n't"", 'take', 'know', 'what', 'anybody', 'brooding', 'smoldering', 'intensity', 'character', 'retired', 'working-class', 'white', 'man', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'how', 'neighborhood', 'been', 'taken', 'over', 'various', 'minorities', 'gangs', 'years', 'becoming', 'crime', 'ridden', 'homes', 'falling', 'disrepair', 'fact', 'be', 'only', 'white', 'guy', 'left', 'racist', 'feelings', 'bullies', 'senseless', 'violence', 'even', 'more', 'when', 'aid', 'neighboring', 'Hmong', 'boy', 'when', 'victimized', 'local', 'Asian', 'gang', 'unwittingly', 'unwillingly', 'hero', 'boy', 'family.Eastwood', 'up', 'awkward', 'friendship', 'boy', 'old', 'fashioned', 'values', 'grew', 'up', 'hard', 'work', 'self-reliance', 'independence', 'discipline', 'integrity', 'values', 'very', 'little', 'evidence', 'now', 'fallen', 'neighborhood', 'scene', 'where', 'boy', 'talk', 'man', 'one', 'funniest', 'scenes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'overall', 'serious', 'tone', 'movie', 'not', 'humorous', 'moments', 'too', 'Overall', 'remarkable', 'performance', 'movie', 'Eastwood', 'fitting', 'cap', 'great', 'career', 'Even', 'will', 'have', 'gone', 'out', 'top', 'game', 'Not', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'still', 'working', 'age', '78', 'can', 'say']",Gran Torino

1209032,A2ULSA0IRUE09E,B001KVZ6ES,Marc Cabir Davis,"[3, 3]","Clint Eastwoods' post production period on ""Changeling"" (2008) is when he apparently found the time to craft ""Gran Torino"". Only an institution as archaic and delusional as the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences could neglect this work of art during awards season, and like ""Changeling"", this too was shut out in all major categories (and sadly, even from the minor categories). What this says about the members' cinematic tastes one can only speculate upon, but chances are they haven't properly understood the depth and brilliance contained within this concise motion picture.As one reviewer aptly stated, this film is not about the car (1972 was a good year for Ford), but the car does come to represent the very essence of the lead character. He plays a mean-spirited old man who is racist, conservative, rude and anti-social, but at the heart of it he seems to be the very opposite of all these things. The film casts him as the sole white resident of an increasingly ethnically diverse lower-income neighborhood, and his attitudes (as vintage as his car) seem to reflect a dying America that seems unable to cope with the diversity brought about by immigration.The film also pays homage to the Hmong people, a true group of Eastern people who were displaced early on, and who have found pockets of solace within America. Even within Eastern societies, this particular group of people have been looked upon as overly conservative and traditional, a fact that the film lovingly pays tribute to, without hitting you over the head with it. Many mainstream publications seem to indicate that this film is about tackling racism and overcoming color lines. Well, that is but part of it, and in many ways not even. Race becomes a very secondary issue here, and by the end of the film you find yourself unable to find the issue relevant at all.Ultimately, the story is about a widower who finds he has no purpose in life, but he also has a difficult past, having been in the military at one point. There are thousands of such veterans all over the world, and this could be their story. Whats incredible is that even though most of our lives are far removed from the lead characters', you will find yourself empathizing with the character, and his racist attitudes seem almost humorous (it also seems that he is less racist than he is territorial).""Gran Torino"" is not a thriller or a fast-paced action film as its' misleading cover might indicate. Hardly. There are a few scenes of violence and one unnerving segment featuring a female lead (a great acting job by Eastwood here), but other than that, this is largely dialog driven. Its' most affecting segments come when Eastwood tries to integrate with his Eastern neighbors - largely humorous, but you'll find yourself relating to these scenes in ways you hadn't imagined. The standout performance is by the young lad who plays Thao, who plays the second lead - its an innocent, camera-friendly performance that relies more on fortitude than actual acting, but he does a commendable job.This is also clearly not a film for everybody. Some may find it heavy-handed and unbelievable, but the end of the film is so moving and apt, that it should get to the most jaded viewer. Prime bits of trivia also litter the films sets, and more educated audiences will have fun trying to pick up on them.

A Korean War veteran and lifelong Ford autoworker (""Would it kill you to buy American..."") - he snarls at his scantily dressed teenage granddaughter who disrespectfully texts someone while attending his wife's funeral. He spits on his next door neighbour's front lawn because it's not as spic and span as his own - and looks close to punching out the well-meaning but life-nave local young priest Father Janovich who just wants to 'help' after his wife's passing (dialogue above). And as the American flag flies over his home - Walt and his dog Daisy sit on the porch not suffering anyone let alone fools gladly - while drinking brews and cursing the rubbish printed in the Astrology section.His middle-aged sons Mitch and Steve live as far away from him as possible (Michigan mostly) and despair of his grouchy growling nature - permanently frothing at the state of the America he fought for in 1952's E-Company Platoon. He calls people in the Chinese and Mexican neighbourhood gooks, spicks and swamp rats. When a crowd of well wishers descend on his home for his wife's wake - he snarls ""I guess they heard there's gonna be a lot of ham..."" Walt Kowalski isn't the nicest person in the world. Yet despite his war ghosts (""The thing that haunts a man the most is the thing he isn't ordered to do..."") - Walt has decency in his veins and values in his still-alert mind. And with rifles to fend off intruders - he's kept pristine an American classic car in the garage adjacent to his Detroit home - a 1972 Gran Torino Sport built by his beloved Ford.Meanwhile gangs of Hmong and Mexican dudes cruise the streets in cars with guns and semi-automatic rifles looking for trouble or an opportunity to steal something. Walt's immediate neighbours are Hmong - and he snarls at them too. Amongst their large number is older sister and younger brother Sue and Thao. A cousin called Spider in a Hmong Gang has been trying to groom the young Thao - until one day Walt intervenes with his rifle and saves the young boy. To his cringing horror the gook neighbours he was offing all those decades back begin to shower him and his porch with gifts of gratitude. But again - despite their best efforts - he tells them to stick it where the sun doesn't shine.One afternoon as Sue (wonderfully played by Ahney Her) is walking home with a wannabe hoodie white boy called Trey on a sort of date - they are set upon by three youths with bad intent towards her. Walt is passing in his truck - sorts them out with a handgun he will clearly use - and gets talking to Sue as they drive back about her 'hill people' and especially her obstinate but dim younger brother Thao (great work from Bee Vang). Slowly he learns of her Asian family's origins (escaping murdering Communists in Vietnam) and likes her spunk. A fledgling relationship begins. A relationship that will see him defend and honour what he once body-bagged with such ease...Directed by Clint Eastwood and written by Nick Schenk and Dave Johannson - ""Gran Torino"" features a cast of unknowns and tackles subjects rarely seen on Hollywood billboards. It's masterful stuff with Eastwood as Director and Lead Actor firing on all sixes - getting his teeth into important and relevant stuff. It's also ballsy in its portrayals - and of course what makes his Walt so likeable is that he does speak his mind - does have his own marbles - even if they aren't the most politically correct colours...The BLU RAY picture quality is immaculate throughout - beautifully film. It's defaulted to 2.40:1 Aspect Ratio so there are bars top and bottom - but even stretched to Full Aspect - it looks properly fabulous.Audio is Dolby TrueHD, English 5.1 Dolby Digital, English 5.1, French 5.1, German 5.1, Italian 5.1, Castellan Spanish 5.1 and English 2.0 Audio Descriptive Service. Subtitles are English, Complex Chinese, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Korean, Norwegian, Castellan Spanish and Swedish (Movie and Bonus Material). Extras include ""Manning The Wheel: The Meaning Of Manhood As Reflected In American Car Culture"", ""Gran Torino: More Than A Car"" and exclusive to BLU RAY ""The Eastwood Way - Exploring The Actor/Director's Filmmaking Process Up Close"".Racism is a hard one to get right on film - ""Crash"" and ""The Help"" are stunning also (see reviews) - and Eastwood's contribution is up there with those masterpieces.Driving home as he warms to his Native American neighbour - Walt says to Sue with a smile -

1209040,A36EW68H08UOCS,B001KVZ6ES,"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[5, 5]","I apologize to anyone offended by the title of my review, but if that sentence offended you in a way you'll never get over, this is not the movie for you.Clint Eastwood proves again that he is one of our most gifted directors and actors.  His films are ABOUT something and he consistently rises above expectations we might have because of watching films not as good as the ones he makes.  In the early part of ""Million Dollar Baby"" I thought I was watching a well-made remake of Rocky with a female boxer - then in the final act that movie became about something entirely different.Gran Torino shapes up like a mis-matched buddy film.  Later it begins to look like it will become Death Wish for the AARP.  Mr. Eastwood chooses projects that do not stick to formulas and we are the lucky benefactors of his unconventional choices.Clint portrays Walt Kowalski, and Walt is from that generation of men trained to keep their feelings inside, even when they've experienced the kind of horrors that win Silver Crosses in Korea.  The film opens at the funeral of Walt's wife and we learn quickly that he is emotionally distant from both of his sons and their families.  They think he's a grumpy old coot - and he is - and he think's they're a bunch of lazy softies, raising selfish grand-children.After Korea Walt worked in the local Ford factory, and his prized possession is a 1972 Gran Torino he helped build and maintains in pristine condition.  A grand-daughter approaches grandpa after the funeral, asking Walt who he plans to... uh... you know... leave the car to after he, uh, you know....  Walt scowls silently in reply.  Walt scowls a lot, because if he doesn't like his own family you can imagine what he thinks about his neighborhood, where his fellow white auto-workers are moving out and the homes are increasingly inhabited by minorities.  A Hmong family lives next door, which is a difficult thing to accept for a man who killed many Asians in Korea.  Walt repeatedly orders anyone who steps a toe onto his property away.Rival Hmong gangs pass the days cruising the streets, talking tough and waving guns to demonstrate their machismo.  Thao, the teenaged boy from the family next door, is recruited by his cousin into one of the gangs.  Walt catches Thao trying to steal the prized car as gang initiation.Thao's mother and sister Sue come over the next day to make Thao apologize and offer a week of Thao's services to Walt to preserve the family honor.  Bee Vang performs serviceably as Thao, but Ahney Her as Sue is a find.  She is witty, spunky, friendly and has no difficulty standing up to Walt and the local gangstas.In the opening funeral we meet the local priest, Father Janovich (played with cherub-cheeked earnesty by Christopher Carley).  The kindly father tells Walt that he promised Mrs. Kowalski before she died that he would make Walt go to confession.  Walt tells the young priest in no uncertain terms that he has no intention of going to confession, but father doesn't give up on Walt, and we get the sense that it is as much out of honest human compassion and caring as trying to comply with the death-bed wish of Mrs. Kowalski.We get to see Walt grow, and he is as surprised as we are that he becomes closer to the family next door than he is to his own sons.  Thao grows also, partly because of Walt, and partly despite him.  The gruff epithet spouting part of Walt never goes away, so this is not a Disney-esque transformation.In one scene we see Walt take Thao to the local barber shop more to teach him to curse ""like a man"" than for a haircut, and in the next scene we see that Thao has learned his lesson well.  I saw a few reviews before the film, but hadn't seen a mention of the humor contained within the two-hour running time.  Humor changes with perspective though, and much comes from the openly racist Walt being forced into situations he ordinarily would never choose.  The Mrs. and I laughed often, as did the rest of the auditorium.  Despite the grouchy nature of the protagonist there is a good-hearted feeling that permeates the film.In the final reel things escalate between Walt, the neighbors and the gang-members.  I've seen reviews second-guessing the ending, but for the Walt we've come to know in the film, the ending makes perfect sense.",5,Didja hear the one about the Polack who lived next door to the Slopes?,1234828800,"02 17, 2009",2009,4294,"['apologize', 'anyone', 'offended', 'title', 'review', 'sentence', 'offended', 'way', ""'ll"", 'never', 'get', 'over', 'not', 'movie', 'you.Clint', 'Eastwood', 'again', 'one', 'most', 'gifted', 'directors', 'actors', 'films', 'are', 'something', 'consistently', 'expectations', 'might', 'have', 'watching', 'films', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'ones', 'early', 'part', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'thought', 'was', 'watching', 'well-made', 'remake', 'Rocky', 'female', 'boxer', 'then', 'final', 'act', 'movie', 'became', 'something', 'entirely', 'different.Gran', 'Torino', 'up', 'mis-matched', 'buddy', 'film', 'Later', 'look', 'will', 'become', 'Death', 'Wish', 'AARP', 'Mr.', 'Eastwood', 'projects', 'do', 'not', 'stick', 'formulas', 'are', 'lucky', 'benefactors', 'unconventional', 'choices.Clint', 'portrays', 'Walt', 'Kowalski', 'Walt', 'generation', 'men', 'trained', 'keep', 'feelings', 'even', 'when', ""'ve"", 'experienced', 'kind', 'horrors', 'win', 'Silver', 'Crosses', 'Korea', 'film', 'funeral', 'Walt', 'wife', 'learn', 'quickly', 'emotionally', 'distant', 'sons', 'families', 'think', 'grumpy', 'old', 'coot', 'think', ""'re"", 'bunch', 'lazy', 'softies', 'raising', 'selfish', 'grand-children.After', 'Korea', 'Walt', 'worked', 'local', 'Ford', 'factory', 'prized', 'possession', '1972', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'helped', 'build', 'maintains', 'pristine', 'condition', 'grand-daughter', 'approaches', 'grandpa', 'funeral', 'asking', 'Walt', 'who', 'uh', 'know', 'leave', 'car', 'uh', 'know', 'Walt', 'silently', 'reply', 'Walt', 'lot', ""n't"", 'like', 'own', 'family', 'can', 'imagine', 'what', 'neighborhood', 'where', 'fellow', 'white', 'auto-workers', 'are', 'moving', 'out', 'homes', 'are', 'increasingly', 'inhabited', 'minorities', 'Hmong', 'family', 'next', 'door', 'difficult', 'thing', 'accept', 'man', 'who', 'killed', 'many', 'Asians', 'Korea', 'Walt', 'repeatedly', 'orders', 'anyone', 'who', 'toe', 'property', 'away.Rival', 'Hmong', 'gangs', 'pass', 'days', 'cruising', 'streets', 'talking', 'tough', 'waving', 'guns', 'demonstrate', 'machismo', 'Thao', 'teenaged', 'boy', 'family', 'next', 'door', 'recruited', 'cousin', 'one', 'gangs', 'Walt', 'Thao', 'trying', 'steal', 'prized', 'car', 'gang', 'initiation.Thao', 'mother', 'sister', 'Sue', 'next', 'day', 'make', 'Thao', 'apologize', 'offer', 'week', 'Thao', 'services', 'Walt', 'preserve', 'family', 'honor', 'Bee', 'Vang', 'serviceably', 'Thao', 'Ahney', 'Her', 'Sue', 'find', 'witty', 'spunky', 'friendly', 'difficulty', 'standing', 'up', 'Walt', 'local', 'gangstas.In', 'opening', 'funeral', 'meet', 'local', 'priest', 'Father', 'Janovich', 'played', 'cherub-cheeked', 'earnesty', 'Christopher', 'Carley', 'kindly', 'father', 'tells', 'Walt', 'promised', 'Mrs.', 'Kowalski', 'died', 'would', 'make', 'Walt', 'go', 'confession', 'Walt', 'young', 'priest', 'uncertain', 'terms', 'intention', 'going', 'confession', 'father', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'Walt', 'get', 'sense', 'as', 'much', 'honest', 'human', 'compassion', 'caring', 'trying', 'comply', 'death-bed', 'wish', 'Mrs.', 'Kowalski.We', 'get', 'see', 'Walt', 'grow', 'as', 'surprised', 'are', 'closer', 'family', 'door', 'own', 'sons', 'Thao', 'also', 'partly', 'Walt', 'partly', 'gruff', 'epithet', 'spouting', 'part', 'Walt', 'never', 'away', 'not', 'Disney-esque', 'transformation.In', 'one', 'scene', 'see', 'Walt', 'take', 'Thao', 'local', 'barber', 'shop', 'more', 'teach', 'curse', 'man', 'haircut', 'next', 'scene', 'see', 'Thao', 'learned', 'lesson', 'well', 'saw', 'few', 'reviews', 'film', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'mention', 'humor', 'contained', 'two-hour', 'running', 'time', 'Humor', 'changes', 'perspective', 'much', 'openly', 'racist', 'Walt', 'being', 'forced', 'situations', 'ordinarily', 'would', 'never', 'choose', 'Mrs.', 'laughed', 'often', 'did', 'rest', 'auditorium', 'grouchy', 'nature', 'protagonist', 'good-hearted', 'feeling', 'film.In', 'final', 'reel', 'things', 'escalate', 'Walt', 'neighbors', 'gang-members', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'reviews', 'second-guessing', 'ending', 'Walt', ""'ve"", 'come', 'know', 'film', 'ending', 'perfect', 'sense']",Gran Torino

What his unforgettable Unforgiven did for westerns, Gran Torino very well may do for dramas. He loves to head fake his audience as he cleverly sidesteps stereotypical characters and concepts. You think you know Clint Eastwood, think again.This isn't Dirty Harry or Josey Wales, nor is it Million Dollar Baby or Mystic River. This is come to expect the unexpected 21st century Clint Eastwood. Like a vintage wine, he keeps getting better with age.

1209043,AAW58LG72PG7I,B001KVZ6ES,"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor""","[3, 3]","In GRAN TORINO, Clint Eastwood has pulled off the rarest of Hollywood trifectas, a hugely successful film in which the lead actor also directs and produces. Clint is Walter Kowalski.  Think of Kowalski as an embittered, racist Dirty Harry who, twenty years prior, has turned in his badge. His wife of fifty years dies in the opening credits.  He is vastly disappointed in his sons, daughters-in-law, and grandchildren, all of whom wish him to wrap up his affairs with them as the assorted beneficiaries.  It is only midway through that we learn the reason for his being ornery.  During the Korean war he killed a number of the enemy, including one who was trying only to surrender.  There has not been a single night that his conscience does not torment him.  His memories lead him to drown in incessant racism toward Asians.  Into this volatile mix, come a neighborhood of Hmong, one family of whom lives directly next door.  Kowalski and the Hmong size each other up, mostly in a negative way.  It is only at the point of an abortive attempt by one of them, Tao (Bee Vang), to steal the Gran Torino of the title that Kowalski begins to look past the long entrenched prejudices of his past.  Kowalski befriends Tao, but would never admit to calling it that.  Instead, he allows himself to accept what the Hmong call a repayment of a favor when he saves Tao from a beating by some local gang bangers.Part of the joy of GRAN TORINO is to see just how much Eastwood can emote with merely a glance or a scowl. He spares no one, least of all himself. When he sees his valley girl granddaughter act like the airhead she is at his funeral, he winces.  When he sees some local thugs harrass Tao's sister, he winces too, but in this latter case, his evolution as a human being leads him to recognize that in helping others he is also helping himself regain his own moral compass.  The latter half of the film details how Kowalski slowly and then more rapidly insinuates himself into a Hmong culture whose outward differences are outward mostly in detail, but in the things that count, their culture and his intertwine at more than one thread.  Eastwood plays Kowalski as a man who has learned some truly bitter lessons from a life that has yet one more to give.  But this last lesson (which I shall not reveal here) is the sternest test yet of his ability to shed some much unneeded baggage in his quest to rejoin the human race.  GRAN TORINO is truly the best picture of the year.",5,Gran Torino is Truly Grand,1231632000,"01 11, 2009",2009,2473,"['GRAN', 'TORINO', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'pulled', 'off', 'rarest', 'Hollywood', 'trifectas', 'hugely', 'successful', 'film', 'lead', 'actor', 'also', 'Clint', 'Walter', 'Kowalski', 'Think', 'Kowalski', 'embittered', 'racist', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'who', 'twenty', 'years', 'prior', 'turned', 'badge', 'wife', 'fifty', 'years', 'opening', 'credits', 'vastly', 'disappointed', 'sons', 'daughters-in-law', 'grandchildren', 'whom', 'wish', 'wrap', 'up', 'affairs', 'assorted', 'beneficiaries', 'only', 'midway', 'learn', 'reason', 'being', 'ornery', 'Korean', 'war', 'killed', 'number', 'enemy', 'including', 'one', 'who', 'was', 'trying', 'only', 'surrender', 'not', 'been', 'single', 'night', 'conscience', 'not', 'torment', 'memories', 'lead', 'drown', 'incessant', 'racism', 'Asians', 'Into', 'volatile', 'mix', 'come', 'neighborhood', 'Hmong', 'one', 'family', 'whom', 'directly', 'next', 'door', 'Kowalski', 'Hmong', 'size', 'other', 'up', 'mostly', 'negative', 'way', 'only', 'point', 'abortive', 'attempt', 'one', 'Tao', 'Bee', 'Vang', 'steal', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'title', 'Kowalski', 'look', 'long', 'entrenched', 'prejudices', 'past', 'Kowalski', 'Tao', 'would', 'never', 'admit', 'calling', 'Instead', 'accept', 'what', 'Hmong', 'call', 'repayment', 'favor', 'when', 'Tao', 'beating', 'local', 'gang', 'bangers.Part', 'joy', 'GRAN', 'TORINO', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'Eastwood', 'can', 'emote', 'merely', 'glance', 'scowl', 'one', 'least', 'When', 'valley', 'girl', 'granddaughter', 'act', 'airhead', 'funeral', 'When', 'local', 'thugs', 'harrass', 'Tao', 'sister', 'too', 'latter', 'case', 'evolution', 'human', 'being', 'recognize', 'helping', 'others', 'also', 'helping', 'regain', 'own', 'moral', 'compass', 'latter', 'half', 'film', 'details', 'how', 'Kowalski', 'slowly', 'then', 'more', 'rapidly', 'Hmong', 'culture', 'outward', 'differences', 'are', 'outward', 'mostly', 'detail', 'things', 'count', 'culture', 'intertwine', 'more', 'one', 'thread', 'Eastwood', 'Kowalski', 'man', 'who', 'learned', 'truly', 'bitter', 'lessons', 'life', 'yet', 'one', 'more', 'give', 'last', 'lesson', 'shall', 'not', 'reveal', 'here', 'sternest', 'test', 'yet', 'ability', 'shed', 'much', 'unneeded', 'baggage', 'quest', 'rejoin', 'human', 'race', 'GRAN', 'TORINO', 'truly', 'best', 'picture', 'year']",Gran Torino

Some of us remember him as far back as his ""Rawhide"" days, and journeyed with him during his ""Spaghetti Western"" and ""Dirty Harry"" eras. Eastwood's company, ""Malpaso"" was formed in the late 60s and ""Malpaso Productions"" in the late 70s. It's from that era on, I've developed a true admiration of his work and that brings us toGran Torino (Widescreen Edition)It's important to say upfront that ""Gran Torino"" is not about the car - only what it symbolizes. ""Gran Torino"" is not an easy story and Walt Kowalski (played, directed, and produced by Eastwood) is not an easy or necessarily likeable man. In some ways, the character much reminded me of Al Pacino's ""Lt. Col. Frank Slade"" in ""Scent of a Woman."" The words ""curmudgeon,"" ""obtuse,"" ""hard-boiled,"" and ""bigoted"" are just some of the descriptives. Kowalski has just lost his wife, is ill, is not happy with his life, with the world, his own neighborhood, or himself.Kowalski is especially vexed by his next door neighbors - who are ""Hmong"" immigrants, and a young priest (played by Christopher Carley) who is bent on watching over Kowalski. The priest, who looks ten minutes older than a middle school student, means well, but thinks he has invented the answers to life. At least, at the beginning.Then we add local gangs and their machinations into the mix and Kowalski finds himself in the position of defending his Asian neighbors. He is still resistant to friendship, but gradually the young boy Thao (Bee Vang) and his sister Sue (Ahney Her) get under his skin.It may be a cliche', but this is a ""coming of age"" story for many of the characters - including Kowalski when he makes an irrevocably final sacrifice in defense of the Asian family. Kowalski, in his own way, grew with one giant leap of selflessness.Like much of real life, this is a pretty tough story to take, but it leaves us with a sense of hope and the potentiality that people can change.",5,Gran Torino - Coming of Age,1245369600,"06 19, 2009",2009,1995,"['been', 'interesting', 'observe', 'evolution', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'years', 'remember', 'far', 'back', 'Rawhide', 'days', 'journeyed', 'Spaghetti', 'Western', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'eras', 'Eastwood', 'company', 'Malpaso', 'was', 'formed', 'late', '60s', 'Malpaso', 'Productions', 'late', '70s', 'era', ""'ve"", 'developed', 'true', 'admiration', 'work', 'toGran', 'Torino', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'important', 'say', 'upfront', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'not', 'car', 'only', 'what', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'not', 'easy', 'story', 'Walt', 'Kowalski', 'played', 'directed', 'produced', 'Eastwood', 'not', 'easy', 'necessarily', 'likeable', 'man', 'ways', 'character', 'much', 'reminded', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Lt.', 'Col.', 'Frank', 'Slade', 'Scent', 'Woman', 'words', 'curmudgeon', 'obtuse', 'hard-boiled', 'bigoted', 'are', 'just', 'descriptives', 'Kowalski', 'just', 'lost', 'wife', 'ill', 'not', 'happy', 'life', 'world', 'own', 'neighborhood', 'himself.Kowalski', 'especially', 'vexed', 'next', 'door', 'neighbors', 'who', 'are', 'Hmong', 'immigrants', 'young', 'priest', 'played', 'Christopher', 'Carley', 'who', 'bent', 'watching', 'over', 'Kowalski', 'priest', 'who', 'ten', 'minutes', 'older', 'middle', 'school', 'student', 'well', 'invented', 'answers', 'life', 'least', 'beginning.Then', 'add', 'local', 'gangs', 'machinations', 'mix', 'Kowalski', 'position', 'defending', 'Asian', 'neighbors', 'still', 'resistant', 'friendship', 'gradually', 'young', 'boy', 'Thao', 'Bee', 'Vang', 'sister', 'Sue', 'Ahney', 'Her', 'get', 'skin.It', 'may', 'be', 'cliche', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'many', 'characters', 'including', 'Kowalski', 'when', 'irrevocably', 'final', 'sacrifice', 'defense', 'Asian', 'family', 'Kowalski', 'own', 'way', 'grew', 'one', 'giant', 'leap', 'selflessness.Like', 'much', 'real', 'life', 'pretty', 'tough', 'story', 'take', 'sense', 'hope', 'potentiality', 'people', 'can', 'change']",Gran Torino

DaVega ""pop culture historian""","[3, 4]","Okay, so I know the year is only just getting started, but Clint Eastwood's Gran Torino right out of the gates is already the first truly great film of 2009. Clint Eastwood is firmly at the helm of this top-notch drama as both director and star. Not only is he fully capable of convincing you he's still one mean, tough son-of-a-gun at almost 79 years of age, but he directs with such razor-sharp clarity and focus when many other directors half his age have only blurry, half-hearted visions of where their movies are going.I won't bother getting into covering the plot here this time around as other reviewers have already done a competent, commendable job of doing so. (I'll save that for the home dvd release, which I'll most certainly be buying!) I especially liked Eastwood's character of Walt Kowalski, as he is so gruff and cynical that he's actually comically endearing as a result. I kind of prefered to think of him as 'Dirty' Harry Callahan in retirement, or at least an extension. The gradually forming acceptance and bond between Walt and Thao as mentor and pupil really made the movie for me, and it's quite rewarding to watch.The only element about this movie I don't like is the notion and sense that it's Clint's goodbye to acting. There's something in the structure and general feeling of Gran Torino similar to The Hunter (1980), Steve McQueen's somewhat elegaic final film. Although this would be quite a fine note to end his illustrious acting career on, it's still sad to think that this could be the last time we see Eastwood's trademark grimaces of indignant rage at injustice or stupidity. Hopefully Eastwood's not quite finished with his work in FRONT of the camera just yet.This movie is fully deserving of its praise due to its excellent characterization and a climatic twist that was (in a good way) different than what I expected. I'm confident in declaring this Clint Eastwood's best movie of the past 15 years and I predict it will be remembered for years and years to come. Not to give anything away, but I felt the movie's ending and final scene in particular had a poignant, Brian's Song-like quality and feel to it, which welcomingly made it all the more bittersweet. Years from now, people will still be talking about this movie and remember it favorably as one of Eastwood's finest later performances. Superb drama.

1209054,AT393OR1JTYNR,B001KVZ6ES,Miami Nights,"[71, 75]","Some have criticized ""Gran Torino"" as being too simple, cliched and hurt by the performances of the film's first-time actors.But this is one of those rare movies that's bigger than the sum of its parts. In recent years, I have yet to see a film that managed to get both men and women to cry. And that it would provoke such strong emotions is not evident until the last act.It may seem simple and cliched on the surface, and while I knew that Clint Eastwood's character Walt would eventually warm up to his Hmong neighbors, I didn't expect that the movie would also have me, a guy who doesn't cry at movies, wiping my eyes. And not just once, but the three other times I saw the film at the theater. And I heard other people crying at every viewing.Each time I viewed it, it was just as powerful, if not more.Walt is an old, bitter racist, who just about hates everyone, including the young pastor who visits him regularly at the request of Walt's late wife, and his own children and their families.On paper, the story seems simple, but its power is hard to deny. It's part drama, part comedy, part tale of one man's racist surface, but as the credits roll, you realize that the power of the movie, the emotional buttons it pushes, make this a movie that rises above the acting, above its direction, above its script, to make something deeper and emotionally touching than most would have expected.There are subtle touches and small scenes that any other director would not have folded into the film. And they do go by like a breeze for the most part. They'll have you laughing, smiling or shaking your head.And it's good that Eastwood's character does not make a complete (and unrealistic) 360 degree turn, as you see in most American movies.And given what Eastwood has delivered in most of his movies, most notably as Dirty Harry and his various Westerns, you expect a big showdown to come, and that showdown does come, but not with the ending you expect.Eastwood has made powerful movies before, but this one really seemed to touch the core of many people, across many age groups, and racial/ethnic designations.On a side note, Eastwood has also done what so many Hollywood studios and filmmakers choose not to do, which is portray Asian-Americans as regular, everyday people, living in America. That's no small feat, as most Hollywood studios go out of their way to not cast Asian-Americans and not show the lives of Asian-Americans. They rather change the race of the characters, even when they're basing a movie on a real-life story about Asian-American people, or offer easy, ignorant stereotypes.Eastwood only deserves credit, because it's something that should have been done decades ago.And while this movie may not get much kudos from the snobby critics in the big film world, it has a emotional pull that even some recent Eastwood movies don't have.It may not have won any big awards, but it's a movie I plan on watching for years to come.",4,"Powerful, emotional film that's bigger than the sum of its parts",1239753600,"04 15, 2009",2009,2950,"['have', 'criticized', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'being', 'too', 'simple', 'cliched', 'hurt', 'performances', 'film', 'first-time', 'actors.But', 'one', 'rare', 'movies', 'bigger', 'sum', 'parts', 'recent', 'years', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'film', 'managed', 'get', 'men', 'women', 'cry', 'would', 'provoke', 'such', 'strong', 'emotions', 'not', 'evident', 'last', 'act.It', 'may', 'seem', 'simple', 'cliched', 'surface', 'knew', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'character', 'Walt', 'would', 'eventually', 'warm', 'up', 'Hmong', 'neighbors', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'movie', 'would', 'also', 'have', 'guy', 'who', ""n't"", 'cry', 'movies', 'wiping', 'eyes', 'not', 'just', 'once', 'three', 'other', 'times', 'saw', 'film', 'theater', 'heard', 'other', 'people', 'crying', 'viewing.Each', 'time', 'viewed', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'powerful', 'not', 'more.Walt', 'old', 'bitter', 'racist', 'who', 'just', 'hates', 'everyone', 'including', 'young', 'pastor', 'who', 'regularly', 'request', 'Walt', 'late', 'wife', 'own', 'children', 'families.On', 'paper', 'story', 'simple', 'power', 'hard', 'deny', 'part', 'drama', 'part', 'comedy', 'part', 'tale', 'one', 'man', 'racist', 'surface', 'credits', 'roll', 'realize', 'power', 'movie', 'emotional', 'buttons', 'make', 'movie', 'acting', 'direction', 'script', 'make', 'something', 'deeper', 'emotionally', 'touching', 'most', 'would', 'have', 'are', 'subtle', 'touches', 'small', 'scenes', 'other', 'director', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'folded', 'film', 'do', 'go', 'breeze', 'most', 'part', ""'ll"", 'have', 'laughing', 'smiling', 'shaking', 'head.And', 'good', 'Eastwood', 'character', 'not', 'make', 'complete', 'unrealistic', '360', 'degree', 'turn', 'see', 'most', 'American', 'movies.And', 'given', 'what', 'Eastwood', 'delivered', 'most', 'movies', 'most', 'notably', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'various', 'Westerns', 'expect', 'big', 'showdown', 'come', 'showdown', 'come', 'not', 'ending', 'expect.Eastwood', 'made', 'powerful', 'movies', 'one', 'really', 'seemed', 'touch', 'core', 'many', 'people', 'many', 'age', 'groups', 'racial/ethnic', 'designations.On', 'side', 'note', 'Eastwood', 'also', 'done', 'what', 'so', 'many', 'Hollywood', 'studios', 'filmmakers', 'choose', 'not', 'do', 'portray', 'Asian-Americans', 'regular', 'everyday', 'people', 'living', 'America', 'small', 'feat', 'most', 'Hollywood', 'studios', 'go', 'way', 'not', 'cast', 'Asian-Americans', 'not', 'show', 'lives', 'Asian-Americans', 'rather', 'change', 'race', 'characters', 'even', 'when', ""'re"", 'basing', 'movie', 'real-life', 'story', 'Asian-American', 'people', 'offer', 'easy', 'ignorant', 'stereotypes.Eastwood', 'only', 'credit', 'something', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'decades', 'ago.And', 'movie', 'may', 'not', 'get', 'much', 'kudos', 'snobby', 'critics', 'big', 'film', 'world', 'emotional', 'pull', 'even', 'recent', 'Eastwood', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'have.It', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'won', 'big', 'awards', 'movie', 'plan', 'watching', 'years', 'come']",Gran Torino

1209059,A42AB7M4H6V9U,B001KVZ6ES,Michael Jay Sullivan,"[2, 2]","I watched most of his films, and even reruns of Rawhide. The only thing I ever really liked was his early 70's movie ""Play Misty for Me,"" where he showed some emotion other than rage. I know some of his more recent films like ""Million Dollar Baby"" were more well rounded, but I was already too turned off by the gratuitous violence of his earlier films; but he always was, and is, his own man.But shockingly to me, Gran Torino brought Clint, and his career, to a much more conciliatory, and ironically peaceful. higher ground through his enlightening encounter with Hmong culture.Prior to seeing GT, I had read a book on the Hmong culture, Anne Fadiman's ""The Spirit Catches You and You all Fall down.""  They had been an independent ethnic thorn in the side to the Han Chinese dynasties for centuries, before being forced to migrate to the highlands of Laos. During the Vietnam War they were offered various trinkets by the US military invaders to aid them in that awful war. Well,(General) Westmoreland and his cronies, as they often did with their imperialist insensitive inhumanity, did not keep their word and the Hmongs were bombed out of the Laotian highland home- they had always been mountain people. Well to make a long and gruesome story short, these proud people were exiled to the total alien, via squalid refugee camps, American Culture. One family ended up as neighbors of the aged Dirty Harry like character played by Eastwood in a bombed out Detroit, which was symbolically not all that dissimilar to the war ravaged Laos the Huongs were forced to leave.We initially see the Eastwood character (Walt Kowalski, Kowalski was the name of the pre-eminent ""wrastler."" Killer Kowalsi, of the 1950's) left alone with his only contact being with his vulturistic, superficial children, and his memories of Korea and his recently deceased wife. Then the ""gooks"" (the Hmongs) moved next store. Initially Kawalski sees his Hmong neighbors as another assault on the world  of his past, when Detroit, Ford and GM were great. However, we slowly start to see similarities between Kowalski and his Hmong neighbors, who both were exiles from an earlier more triumphant  time, and both were trying to hang on to their crumbling cultural identities. At first, Kowalski, in his usual hard ass (Eastwood) fashion rejects the friendly overtures of his neighbors, but soon he succumbs to their charm, honesty, innocence and authenticity. He becomes a protector and mentor to his neighbors and their children- particularly against the Hmong male gangs that were destroying their American born son. These conflicts were interspersed with moments of humor (e.g.,the thank you party for his protecting them). The transition comes full circle in the final scene when Kowalski doesn't ""bring his guns to town,"" with his hardened heart being opened by his encounters with his proud and humble neighbors. It certainly did, as Dirty Harry once said, ""make my day.""This film can be viewed on many levels. It is a story of a man accepting change and diversity at an age when most people would prefer to dwell on their memories. On a more profound level, Gran Torino suggests the possibility of global unification, or at least respect, of diverse cultures and an unconditional acceptance of ""the other,"" no matter how different they seem on the surface. This was definitely the movie of the year. Moreover, in my opinion, this is Eastwood's most socially conscious and finest film; as Elvis Costello once sang, and this could have been part of the soundtrack ,""What's so funny bout peace, love, and understanding?""",4,"Clint and The Hmongs; Strange Bedfellows, Fine Film",1249689600,"08 8, 2009",2009,3594,"['watched', 'most', 'films', 'even', 'reruns', 'Rawhide', 'only', 'thing', 'ever', 'really', 'liked', 'was', 'early', '70', 'movie', 'Play', 'Misty', 'Me', 'where', 'showed', 'emotion', 'other', 'rage', 'know', 'more', 'recent', 'films', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'were', 'more', 'well', 'rounded', 'was', 'already', 'too', 'turned', 'off', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'earlier', 'films', 'always', 'was', 'own', 'man.But', 'shockingly', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'brought', 'Clint', 'career', 'much', 'more', 'conciliatory', 'ironically', 'peaceful', 'higher', 'ground', 'enlightening', 'encounter', 'Hmong', 'culture.Prior', 'seeing', 'GT', 'had', 'read', 'book', 'Hmong', 'culture', 'Anne', 'Fadiman', 'Spirit', 'Catches', 'all', 'down', 'had', 'been', 'independent', 'ethnic', 'thorn', 'side', 'Han', 'Chinese', 'dynasties', 'centuries', 'being', 'forced', 'migrate', 'highlands', 'Laos', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'were', 'offered', 'various', 'trinkets', 'US', 'military', 'invaders', 'aid', 'awful', 'war', 'Well', 'General', 'Westmoreland', 'cronies', 'often', 'did', 'imperialist', 'insensitive', 'inhumanity', 'did', 'not', 'keep', 'word', 'Hmongs', 'were', 'bombed', 'Laotian', 'highland', 'home-', 'had', 'always', 'been', 'mountain', 'people', 'Well', 'make', 'long', 'gruesome', 'story', 'short', 'proud', 'people', 'were', 'exiled', 'total', 'alien', 'squalid', 'refugee', 'camps', 'American', 'Culture', 'One', 'family', 'ended', 'up', 'neighbors', 'aged', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'character', 'played', 'Eastwood', 'bombed', 'Detroit', 'was', 'symbolically', 'not', 'dissimilar', 'war', 'ravaged', 'Laos', 'Huongs', 'were', 'forced', 'leave.We', 'initially', 'see', 'Eastwood', 'character', 'Walt', 'Kowalski', 'Kowalski', 'was', 'name', 'pre-eminent', 'wrastler', 'Killer', 'Kowalsi', '1950', 'left', 'alone', 'only', 'contact', 'being', 'vulturistic', 'superficial', 'children', 'memories', 'Korea', 'recently', 'deceased', 'wife', 'Then', 'gooks', 'Hmongs', 'moved', 'next', 'store', 'Initially', 'Kawalski', 'Hmong', 'neighbors', 'assault', 'world', 'past', 'when', 'Detroit', 'Ford', 'GM', 'were', 'great', 'However', 'slowly', 'start', 'see', 'similarities', 'Kowalski', 'Hmong', 'neighbors', 'who', 'were', 'exiles', 'earlier', 'more', 'triumphant', 'time', 'were', 'trying', 'hang', 'crumbling', 'cultural', 'identities', 'first', 'Kowalski', 'usual', 'hard', 'ass', 'Eastwood', 'fashion', 'friendly', 'overtures', 'neighbors', 'soon', 'charm', 'honesty', 'innocence', 'authenticity', 'protector', 'mentor', 'neighbors', 'children-', 'particularly', 'Hmong', 'male', 'gangs', 'were', 'destroying', 'American', 'born', 'son', 'conflicts', 'were', 'interspersed', 'moments', 'humor', 'e.g.', 'thank', 'party', 'protecting', 'transition', 'full', 'circle', 'final', 'scene', 'when', 'Kowalski', ""n't"", 'bring', 'guns', 'town', 'hardened', 'heart', 'being', 'opened', 'encounters', 'proud', 'humble', 'neighbors', 'certainly', 'did', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'once', 'said', 'make', 'day', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'many', 'levels', 'story', 'man', 'accepting', 'change', 'diversity', 'age', 'when', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'prefer', 'dwell', 'memories', 'more', 'profound', 'level', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'possibility', 'global', 'unification', 'least', 'respect', 'diverse', 'cultures', 'unconditional', 'acceptance', 'other', 'matter', 'how', 'different', 'seem', 'surface', 'was', 'definitely', 'movie', 'year', 'Moreover', 'opinion', 'Eastwood', 'most', 'socially', 'conscious', 'finest', 'film', 'Elvis', 'Costello', 'once', 'sang', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'part', 'soundtrack', 'What', 'so', 'funny', 'bout', 'peace', 'love', 'understanding']",Gran Torino

1209066,A3V5O5G3I1T2NX,B001KVZ6ES,Mike,"[13, 29]","Synopsis:  Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is an old-school Detroiter (read:  a white Detroiter who stayed in the city after 1967) and Korean war veteran who lost his wife to old age.  He's bitter with both his obnoxious family (who try to milk him for everything he has while providing absolutely nothing in return) and the world that surrounds him (which is crumbling away in a state of apathy.)  As Hmong immigrants start to populate his area, one such family moves next door.  The introverted son of the family, Thao (Bee Vang), is targeted by his cousin who goes by his gang name Spider (Doua Moua) who attempts to ""make him a man"" through having him commit gang-related crimes.  Thao is pressured to go through a robbery attempt on Walt's Gran Torino, only to be caught and nearly shot by Walt.  Spider attempts to rough up Thao and his sister Sue (Ahney Her) when Walt comes out, guns drawn, and commands them to leave.  Indebted to Walt for sticking up to Spider, Sue grows an admiration for Walt while Thao is coerced by his family to ""work off the debt"" after dishonoring the family with his robbery attempt.  Though spiteful of Thao at first, Walt eventually starts to give him the type of guidance needed to discover his manhood.  However, Spider and his gang are insulted by Walt's interference and carries out acts of revenge against Thao, Sue, and their family.  Walt realizes that as long as Spider is around, their family will never rest and he's the only person who can stop him and his thugs from intimidating them...I wrestled with what kinda rating I wanted to give this movie.  In end, I felt it was appropriate to give the film 3.5 stars.  Here's why:Considering that the cast was composed of Clint Eastwood and a bunch of amateurs, the film actually turned out rather well.  It had it's funny moments despite the overall dramatic tone of the film.  Everyone committed to doing the best they could and carried through a certain human element that couldn't be replicated with an all-professional cast, so that was unique in contrast to many of the movies I've seen recently.  The dialogue wasn't pleasant or even remotely P.C., but it reflected the age of Eastwood's character in the film where people addressed each other as such (if you don't know ethnic slurs related to Italians, Polish, Blacks, Asians, etc, you're not gonna learn them here.)  I should also note the ending scenes of the film came as a surprise to me (save the very last one) and left you with the messages of justice through redemption.However, there was a enough that I couldn't look past to feel the film warranted a higher rating, and that had much to do with being a born-and-bred Detroiter who watched the film.  We're dealing with a city that's 82% black with an expanding Arab community, but featured a primarily white and Asian cast aside from three black teenagers and a car full of Hispanic gang members.  Anyone living near Detroit would also wonder why a Polish resident would live in a predominately black Highland Park while Hamtramck, the next town over, has a significant Polish community.  The plot devices involving Walt's immediate family were easy to telegraph from miles away and just reaffirmed the message that idle hands have nothing to show for their labor.  Also, the language in the film would have came as a shock at first, but eventually became stereotypical and tired by the time the film wound down.This movie might be viewed as a conservative movie, but I would recommend it to the NRA supporters and pro-justice crowd rather than the fundamentally religious.  I'd also recommend it to anyone who doesn't have any familiarity with the Detroit area because there's a good chance that the movie's charming moments would sweep you away.  I don't know if I'd put it in the same light as other critically acclaimed movies, but at the end of the day, it wasn't a bad film and I could see why many would enjoy it.

And here he does both, giving a fine performance as Walt Kowalski, a war veteran and retired Ford worker living in Detroit. We pick up Kowalski's story at the funeral of his long time wife. As an unemotional type he will grieve in his own quiet way. We learn at the wake that he has a strained relationship with his 2 grown sons and their families. They have moved on to the greener pastures of the suburbs while Walt stays in his old decaying urban neighborhood. The movie makes the most of the on location filming in Detroit. The dying city is filmed with great effect. You see Clint's character moving through very troubled neighborhoods with vacant storefronts, crime, rundown and abandoned homes. It is sad and unfortunate that this is a true portrayal of Detroit.As someone born and raised in Detroit everything is dead on in it's portrayal of this slowly dying city. I saw a parallel with my own upbringing as I also lived in a neighborhood that changed from predominatly white. My Father had many of the same racist notions that Kowalski has here. And Kowalski has no problem slamming just about every ethnic or racial group- Jews, Asians, Blacks, Latinos, Italians etc.. No group is left out of his (often funny) racist tirades. In finding them humorous I do not claim to share his views or endorse his racially insensitive remarks. It's just the way that Kowalski so proudly takes ownership of his beliefs that make them funny.My father and other racists I have encountered had no problem offering up racist commentary but usually reserved their comments for private conversations. Walt Kowalski is way over the top, he gets right up in there face and does it. In one scene he is invited to a family gathering in a house full of Hmong people. Even though he is the only white amongst them he has no problem referring to them as 'fishheads.'There are interesting performances here - the young priest who challenges Kowalski to come clean with God. The Italian barber who exchanges funny and racist banter with Walt. The young Hmong siblings who befriend Walt and break down his barriers. And this is where the story leads us as Walt gets drawn into helping the young Hmong boy, Tao, who is being troubled by a violent gang. The title of the movie refers to Kowalski's mint condition 1972 Gran Torino. a classic car that he actually had a hand in building at the auto plant. In this troubled neighborhood it is coveted by friend and foe alike. Many of the Asian actors are newcomers and you would think that next to the shining star that is Eastwood they would drag down the film. For the most part that doesn't happen.

But I understand the necessity of his extreme portrayal of the character (& the other characters). He's simply an aged vet who's just lost his wife and is intolerant to the way the world is heading: pointless gang violence, disrespect to ones elders, neglect for personal and public respect of persons and belongings, etc...and the disconnect that children have with their parents and vice versa....I don't blame him for feeling the way he does about the general decay of our culture...for example the grand daughter showing up at the dead grandmothers funeral baring midrif body piercings, etc..smoking at the wake and rudely making inquiries to his belongings that she might take to college. Hello you rude little brat, ever think about someone other than yourself, especially on the day his wife is being buried? Just a thought.

""Hey' that's me"".This revelation was not one of astonishment but one of sadness as we all agreed that the USA today sure isn't the same place we all grew up in the 70s and 80s.Some watch this move and focus on Walt's character overcoming old fashioned racist stereotypes to befriend his new neighbors.Others also comment on the equally significant social commentary in this film that essentially shows us that although his speech and manners may be rough and course, Walt basically has the right view of how America is changing for the worse.Like Walt, it seems we have had to move every 10 years or so as the urbanization and social decline of America gradually destroys once good neighborhoods and sickens our society like a cancer.This is a much better film than much of the stuff nominated for awards this year (big surprise) and actually TELLS A STORY instead of being mindless eye candy and CGI special effects.Definately an addition to the DVD collection.",5,Hits Close to home,1236470400,"03 8, 2009",2009,1794,"['near', '50', 'can', 'relate', 'character', 'Walt', 'played', 'Eastwood', 'film.No', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'am', 'extreme', 'racist', 'do', 'share', 'disdain', 'declining', 'sense', 'values', 'morals', 'etiquette', 'honor', 'other', 'behaviours', 'see', 'society', 'ugly', 'elements', 'urban', 'growth', 'negative', 'aspects', 'demographic', 'shifts', 'take', 'grip', 'America.Hey', 'human', 'society', 'never', 'been', 'perfect', 'such', 'thing', 'good', 'old', 'days', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'people', 'took', 'pride', 'neighborhoods', 'were', 'quiet', 'considerate', 'others', 'could', 'let', 'children', 'play', 'day', 'even', 'thinking', 'worrying', 'street', 'gangs', 'pedophiles', 'attacking', 'them.I', 'watched', 'GRAN', 'TORINO', 'group', 'people', 'age', '40', 'various', 'times', 'movie', 'commented', 'Hey', '.This', 'revelation', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'astonishment', 'one', 'sadness', 'agreed', 'USA', 'today', 'sure', ""n't"", 'same', 'place', 'grew', 'up', '70s', '80s.Some', 'watch', 'move', 'focus', 'Walt', 'character', 'overcoming', 'old', 'fashioned', 'racist', 'stereotypes', 'befriend', 'new', 'neighbors.Others', 'also', 'comment', 'equally', 'significant', 'social', 'commentary', 'film', 'essentially', 'speech', 'manners', 'may', 'be', 'rough', 'course', 'Walt', 'basically', 'right', 'view', 'how', 'America', 'changing', 'worse.Like', 'Walt', 'have', 'had', 'move', '10', 'years', 'so', 'urbanization', 'social', 'decline', 'America', 'gradually', 'once', 'good', 'neighborhoods', 'society', 'cancer.This', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'much', 'stuff', 'nominated', 'awards', 'year', 'big', 'surprise', 'actually', 'TELLS', 'A', 'STORY', 'instead', 'being', 'mindless', 'eye', 'candy', 'CGI', 'special', 'effects.Definately', 'addition', 'DVD', 'collection']",Gran Torino

Clint Eastwood really knows how to draw you in at the first scene. This movie shows all that is good about people who are no-nonsense, get-to-the-point, and believe that being politically correct is crap. Eastwood plays this part brilliantly when he portrays Walt Kowalski, an old Korean War veteran who is greatly misunderstood and taken for granted by his family. He eventually befriends an Asian boy named Tao and mentors him on the finer points in being a man. He also looks out for Tao's sister Su and their family that live next door to him. Kowalski stands up against gangs that hang frequently in the neighborhood, and grows very close to Tao and his family. He sees the differences in his family and Tao's and sees the shallow and fake concern of his own family contrasted with the warm, inviting comraderie of Tao's family. Granted, there is a lot of swearing and some violence in this movie, so would not be appropriate for children. However, it seems to fit into this type of movie.

Eastwood is one of my favorite actors and I was really looking forward to seeing this movie.  Playing the neighborhood crank (""Hey, get off my lawn""), in a neighborhood gradually changed around him; he is bigoted and ornery. Dealing with the death of his wife and the realization that all his neighbors are Hmong refugees, he is one angry old man. The problem is credibility. Eastwood's use of racial epithets doesn't seem to effect his neighbors one bit. Calling them every insult imaginable for a person of Eastern descent evokes smiles from the neighbors, except Grandma, who wastes no time telling him off. I thought I was watching ""Walter"", the Jeff Dunham character rather than Eastwood.The gradual shift from hate to a point where Eastwood actually gives his life to save the neighbor's kid is a powerful story line, but lost in the stereotypical way Eastwood acts (or fails to). I just don't think this movie lived up to all the hype. On a minor note, the Gran Torino in the title and mentioned significantly in the trailers is barely a plot line in the movie. Yes, he did help assemble the car; yes, the neighbor did try and steal it, but other than sitting outside and polishing it occasionally, it is not central to the plot at all.

As everyone knows, Eastwood has aged beautifully as both an actor and director over the past 20 years, and both the timing and venue of his exploration of The American Character (either through planning, coincidence, or a bit of both) is impeccable.With the American economy in meltdown and the auto industry dented badly by foreign competition, retired Ford worker Walt Kowalski tries to keep both his cherished Gran Torino and his way of life intact as the ground shifts beneath him in a newly globalized world. With his wife (and most of his generation) having passed on, and immigrants (visible reminders of Kowalski's time in Asia) representing an ever-larger portion of an uneasy melting pot, Eastwood's newest ""anti-hero"" defaults to racial stereotypes as a defense mechanism (as do the street gangs representing various ethnic groups staking out their own turf). Then, suddenly, the neighborhood erupts, as does Kowalski's long-dormant soul, and there's no turning back.Trying desperately to preserve his way of life, Kowalski comes to accept that America's future will have a whole new face to it. Those willing to keep America great may not look like the men who fought alongside him in Korea, but they must be armed with the tools they need to rebuild their neighborhood, city, and country. Sizing up the personal character of his young Hmong immigrant neighbor who ""doesn't have a chance"" in warding off the advances of Asian-on-Asian bullying, Kowalski seeks to provide, both literally and figuratively, the personal equipment that this new American needs to successfully assimilate. Just maybe, in the back of his mind, this aging, crusty ""Polack"" remembers that, despite all the ethnic jokes tossed around among his circle, immigration has always contributed to the next wave of growth in America.With his soul stirring, Kowalski finally takes Confession, but he leaves unstated the biggest sin of his life: killing other human beings. For the relatively innocuous sins that Kowalski proffers, he's asked to atone with some basic Catholic rituals. But Kowalski has another method of atonement in mind, one that, for someone who professes to be not in the least religious, manifests a very Christ-like demonstration of selflessness.By the time Kowalski devises his plan of individual and neighborhood salvation, he realizes that ""enemy"" and ""ally"" cannot be pidgeonholed into ethnic or territorial classifications, just as the meaning of ""family"" is no easy thing to define. He understands that the model of living that he has preserved for so long must be torn up and that he must recalibrate how he views the world for the good of his soul.""Gran Torino"" is at turns a humorous, poignant, and searing movie with pitch-perfect acting by Eastwood, and an earnest and endearing cast of novice supporting actors. It is destined to be a classic. Even the spate of foul language - which accurately reflects the tone and sound of the streets like Kowalski's all across America - does not diminish the significance of this work.This is a muscle car of a movie that idles in your mind.",5,What Does It Mean to Be An American?,1241308800,"05 3, 2009",2009,3254,"['ultimate', 'question', 'living', 'legend', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'thematically', 'perhaps', 'finest', 'movie', 'long', 'distinguished', 'career', 'everyone', 'Eastwood', 'aged', 'beautifully', 'actor', 'director', 'past', '20', 'years', 'timing', 'venue', 'exploration', 'American', 'Character', 'planning', 'coincidence', 'bit', 'impeccable.With', 'American', 'economy', 'meltdown', 'auto', 'industry', 'dented', 'badly', 'foreign', 'competition', 'retired', 'Ford', 'worker', 'Walt', 'Kowalski', 'keep', 'cherished', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'way', 'life', 'intact', 'ground', 'shifts', 'beneath', 'newly', 'globalized', 'world', 'wife', 'most', 'generation', 'having', 'passed', 'immigrants', 'visible', 'reminders', 'Kowalski', 'time', 'Asia', 'representing', 'ever-larger', 'portion', 'uneasy', 'melting', 'pot', 'Eastwood', 'newest', 'anti-hero', 'defaults', 'racial', 'stereotypes', 'defense', 'mechanism', 'do', 'street', 'gangs', 'representing', 'various', 'ethnic', 'groups', 'staking', 'out', 'own', 'turf', 'Then', 'suddenly', 'neighborhood', 'erupts', 'Kowalski', 'long-dormant', 'soul', 'turning', 'back.Trying', 'desperately', 'preserve', 'way', 'life', 'Kowalski', 'accept', 'America', 'future', 'will', 'have', 'whole', 'new', 'face', 'willing', 'keep', 'America', 'great', 'may', 'not', 'look', 'men', 'who', 'fought', 'alongside', 'Korea', 'must', 'be', 'armed', 'tools', 'need', 'rebuild', 'neighborhood', 'city', 'country', 'Sizing', 'up', 'personal', 'character', 'young', 'Hmong', 'immigrant', 'neighbor', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'chance', 'warding', 'off', 'advances', 'Asian-on-Asian', 'bullying', 'Kowalski', 'provide', 'literally', 'figuratively', 'personal', 'equipment', 'new', 'American', 'needs', 'successfully', 'assimilate', 'Just', 'maybe', 'back', 'mind', 'aging', 'crusty', 'Polack', 'remembers', 'ethnic', 'jokes', 'tossed', 'circle', 'immigration', 'always', 'contributed', 'next', 'wave', 'growth', 'America.With', 'soul', 'stirring', 'Kowalski', 'finally', 'Confession', 'unstated', 'biggest', 'sin', 'life', 'killing', 'other', 'human', 'beings', 'relatively', 'innocuous', 'sins', 'Kowalski', 'proffers', 'asked', 'atone', 'basic', 'Catholic', 'rituals', 'Kowalski', 'method', 'atonement', 'mind', 'one', 'someone', 'who', 'be', 'not', 'least', 'religious', 'very', 'Christ-like', 'demonstration', 'time', 'Kowalski', 'plan', 'individual', 'neighborhood', 'salvation', 'enemy', 'ally', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'pidgeonholed', 'ethnic', 'territorial', 'classifications', 'just', 'meaning', 'family', 'easy', 'thing', 'define', 'model', 'living', 'preserved', 'so', 'long', 'must', 'be', 'torn', 'up', 'must', 'recalibrate', 'how', 'world', 'good', 'soul', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'turns', 'humorous', 'poignant', 'searing', 'movie', 'pitch-perfect', 'acting', 'Eastwood', 'earnest', 'endearing', 'cast', 'novice', 'supporting', 'actors', 'destined', 'be', 'classic', 'Even', 'spate', 'foul', 'language', 'accurately', 'tone', 'sound', 'streets', 'Kowalski', 'America', 'not', 'diminish', 'significance', 'work.This', 'muscle', 'car', 'movie', 'mind']",Gran Torino

The best scene in the movie occurs when Eastwood appears with a gun and tells the gang of street thugs to ""Get off my lawn!"".  It shows real attitude.  Anyone who has ever stepped out of the ivory tower long enough to witness the operations of these types of gangs can certainly appreciate this.  Ultimately the film features an epic showdown in which Eastood must take on the gang harassing Tao's family.  There is little left for him but to be put into an old-folk's home by his own superficial and parisitic family or to go out fighting.

Atkinson,"[2, 2]","I saw this film alone in the theatre, as my wife is Asian, and having seen the reviews, I figured that the dialog and language would be somewhat sensitive and racially charged. I was definitely correct in that conclusion. My father turns 80 this year and easily could have played the role of Walt, a man who has never quite understood the concept of political correctness, or the need to welcome people who his own generation has seen war against.I can also attest to the spot-on accuracy of the portrayal of the Hmong family. The neighbor matriarch, the family party and the changing roles between the older and younger generations are all shown with absolute clarity. I have been to the exact types of gatherings that Walt was invited to, and the film portrays it superlatively.I can also appreciate that Eastwood can go beyond the role of Dirty Harry. I am one who believes that Clint is at his best in his deeper, more reflective roles. Think ""Unforgiven"" and ""Million Dollar Baby"" rather than ""Sudden Impact"".

Ever since Play Misty for Me, Clint's directorial projects have consistently been high-quality films.This is probably my favorite Eastwood project - it is multi-layered, affectionate, surprising, and thoroughly engaging.  It makes a pointed and very necessary statement on racial attitudes in the US today.  Moreover, it is an equal-opportunity statement - eventually NO ONE escapes the wrath of Walter Kowalski.Clint portrays an embittered war veteran whose racial attitudes strangely enough seem to come more from popular stereotypes ingrained in his head rather his own personal beliefs.  For me, it seems he is more upset that time has wrought such dramatic changes in his life - he has not had the time or the inclination to catch up with those changes.  He is also in a vulnerable place.  He just lost his wife, his relationship with his sons leaves much to be desired, he has little patience with religious ideas(or so it seems) and he is not well at all for the new racial fabric of his neighborhood.  He DID cherish his wife/marriage, his service to his country, and it appears his only current pleasure is his prized possession, his Gran Torino.Without giving away too much of the plot, suffice it to say, he eventually ""modifies"" his attitude through his involvement with an Asian family living next door.The ending is indeed touching and heroic and quite frankly, beautiful. Strangely enough, however, it seemed disconcertingly like the conclusion of Dirty Harry rather than Walter Kowalski -  this makes it all the more sadder yet infinitely more gratifying.

In ""Gran Torino"" Eastwood tackles the issue of prejudice by showing how a man beyond repair can still come to see the light.The opening of the film tells us all in a few short scenes; elderly widower, unhappy with the world, uncommunicative with his well-meaning sons and their families, staying in a community that ""changed"" into one where he is alone in isolation.  A man whose major life-changing event was the Korean War where he killed Asian enemies who, in turn, had killed his American buddies, he looks out around his Detroit neighborhood and finds himself surrounded by Asians who are, in this case, Hmong refugees.  Either way they are just Asians to him.  Now, all alone after the death of his wife, what is there for him other than his mint condition Gran Torino.Obviously this movie creates a series of events that gets Eastwood off his front porch and involves him with his neighbors.  (Otherwise this would be a pretty boring film).  The manner in which things happen are presented in a believable manner.  The metamorphisis we see happening before us may seen a bit sudden at times but we'll just let that pass as the handiwork of the local (and youthful) priest.  Cultures and generations are heading for a collision and the results leave us with a bittersweet taste.  Heroism takes many forms and we get to observe one form not often portrayed these days.  Given the clerical involvement it may be fair to suggest a few Biblical parallels but I'll let you decide for yourself.I missed seeing this movie on the big screen.  It was in town just a short while and I heard mixed reviews about it.  I can see where some might not care for the ending and I have struggled with a 4 star or a 5 star rating.  I decided on 4 stars by rating ""Gran Torino"" against other recent Eastwood pictures.

It was not surprising to me that he liked it; lead character Walt Kowalski's (Eastwood) love of tools and respect for hard work is right up his alley. A Hmong family moves in next door to Kowalski, and while he at first wants nothing to do with them, due to his distrust of other races, he is drawn into their world, and becomes a mentor to an awkward teenage boy in the family. Ultimately he gets involved with helping the boy stand up to the Hmong gang that is terrorizing him. Kowalski's efforts to teach the kid how to be a regular guy, Detroit working-class style, are a bit jarringly corny, but the drama builds engrossingly. Ultimately we wind up with a religious message, which could be off-putting, but comes across as real and inevitable.

1209137,A2M4SPLZR918MD,B001KVZ6ES,Renee V. Cox,"[3, 3]","Why Gran Torino?In this film, Clint Eastwood's churlish character, Walt Kowalski is a retired Ford auto worker who has stubbornly stayed in his formerly white middle-class neighbourhood in Detroit.  Nowadays his neighbours are what we refer to as ethnic, like the Hmongs living next door.  ""Ethnic"" for Kowalski, who is Polish-American, means just about anyone who is not.We soon learn that Eastwood calls his Hmong neighbours ""gooks,"" his apparently blanket term for Asians, reminding everyone that he killed gooks during his wartime service in Korea.  But he does not discriminate solely against the Hmongs:  he also has pejorative names for his Italian-American barber and for his Irish-American friend who is a construction boss.  The young priest who has promised Kowalski's recently deceased wife that he will, in effect, look after Walt's soul, is spared the ethnic pejoratives, but his stature and gravitas as a very young priest are thoroughly mocked.Kowalski's relations with his own family are distant to non-existent. He talks about his adored wife, but admits he has never communicated well with his own children.  Neither is he a doting grandfather.  His dog Daisy is devoted and undemanding, so she is allowed a niche in his life.Kowalski has a 1972 classic car in his garage, one that he actually worked on in the Ford assembly line.  The Gran Torino was an upscale model produced by Ford in the 1970s.  The name Torino refers to the Italian city of Turin, also an automobile city, where Fiats and Alfa Romeos are manufactured.  So ""Torino"" bestows upon the eight-cylinder  American Ford model a racy European cachet.  Kowalski maintains the car in immaculate condition, but he keeps it shrouded and out of sight except when he's washing and waxing it, like a holy relic that is dressed up and viewed only on special occasions.Thao, the young Hmong boy next door, makes a clumsy and unsuccessful attempt to steal the Grand Torino (part of a botched gang initiation) and is forced by Hmong tradition to atone for this by working for a week or two for Kowalski.  Kowalski makes it clear this is no favour to him, but he manages to make good use of the boy's time and to teach him some fix-it skills.  Thao is not a willing participant in the gang, and he and his sister are rescued a couple of times by Walt, first because the grizzled veteran does not hesitate to pull out his rifle and shoo gang members from his property.  Later his protection becomes more specific, as he drives the appealing but mouthy sister home in his truck from a confrontation during which she recklessly insults the gang.Little by little, we see Walt mellowing.  At one point he has Thao help him carry up a freezer from his basement.  He can't drag it up alone; he needs help.  He says he no longer has a use for it and sells it to the eager Thao for a pittance.  This parallels his character's slow melt from the crusty deep-freeze in which he has enveloped himself over the years.Every time Kowalski wittingly or unwittingly protects the neighbours from gang members, he is flooded by food and flower offerings, gifts of gratitude from the Hmongs, which he attempts to ward off.  Eventually he gives in and accepts them, even enjoying them..  But when gang members perform an attack of enormous magnitude on the family, who are too afraid to go to the police, Kowalski the maverick is not afraid to take matters into his own hands, making sure that the family is protected and his own affairs are in order.There are other sub-plots which explain much about Kowalski, and which are tied up neatly. .  The movie is not without flaws, but they are relatively small ones.  Overall, this is a very satisfying movie, the kind that makes you want to stand up and cheer afterwards.",4,Why Gran Torino?,1231718400,"01 12, 2009",2009,3768,"['Why', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'film', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'churlish', 'character', 'Walt', 'Kowalski', 'retired', 'Ford', 'auto', 'worker', 'who', 'stubbornly', 'stayed', 'formerly', 'white', 'middle-class', 'neighbourhood', 'Detroit', 'Nowadays', 'neighbours', 'are', 'what', 'refer', 'ethnic', 'Hmongs', 'living', 'next', 'door', 'Ethnic', 'Kowalski', 'who', 'Polish-American', 'just', 'anyone', 'who', 'not.We', 'soon', 'learn', 'Eastwood', 'Hmong', 'gooks', 'apparently', 'blanket', 'term', 'Asians', 'reminding', 'everyone', 'killed', 'gooks', 'wartime', 'service', 'Korea', 'not', 'discriminate', 'solely', 'Hmongs', 'also', 'pejorative', 'names', 'Italian-American', 'barber', 'Irish-American', 'friend', 'who', 'construction', 'boss', 'young', 'priest', 'who', 'promised', 'Kowalski', 'recently', 'deceased', 'wife', 'will', 'effect', 'look', 'Walt', 'soul', 'spared', 'ethnic', 'pejoratives', 'stature', 'gravitas', 'very', 'young', 'priest', 'are', 'thoroughly', 'mocked.Kowalski', 'relations', 'own', 'family', 'are', 'distant', 'non-existent', 'adored', 'wife', 'never', 'communicated', 'well', 'own', 'children', 'doting', 'grandfather', 'dog', 'Daisy', 'devoted', 'undemanding', 'allowed', 'niche', 'life.Kowalski', '1972', 'classic', 'car', 'garage', 'one', 'actually', 'worked', 'Ford', 'assembly', 'line', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'was', 'upscale', 'model', 'produced', 'Ford', '1970s', 'name', 'Torino', 'refers', 'Italian', 'city', 'Turin', 'also', 'automobile', 'city', 'where', 'Fiats', 'Alfa', 'Romeos', 'are', 'manufactured', 'Torino', 'eight-cylinder', 'American', 'Ford', 'racy', 'European', 'cachet', 'Kowalski', 'car', 'immaculate', 'condition', 'shrouded', 'sight', 'when', 'washing', 'waxing', 'holy', 'relic', 'dressed', 'up', 'viewed', 'only', 'special', 'occasions.Thao', 'young', 'Hmong', 'boy', 'next', 'door', 'clumsy', 'unsuccessful', 'attempt', 'steal', 'Grand', 'Torino', 'part', 'botched', 'gang', 'initiation', 'forced', 'Hmong', 'tradition', 'atone', 'working', 'week', 'two', 'Kowalski', 'Kowalski', 'clear', 'favour', 'make', 'good', 'use', 'boy', 'time', 'teach', 'fix-it', 'skills', 'Thao', 'not', 'willing', 'participant', 'gang', 'sister', 'are', 'rescued', 'couple', 'times', 'Walt', 'first', 'grizzled', 'veteran', 'not', 'hesitate', 'pull', 'out', 'rifle', 'shoo', 'gang', 'members', 'property', 'Later', 'protection', 'more', 'specific', 'appealing', 'mouthy', 'sister', 'home', 'truck', 'confrontation', 'recklessly', 'gang.Little', 'little', 'see', 'Walt', 'mellowing', 'one', 'point', 'Thao', 'help', 'carry', 'up', 'freezer', 'basement', 'ca', ""n't"", 'drag', 'up', 'alone', 'help', 'no', 'longer', 'use', 'eager', 'Thao', 'pittance', 'character', 'slow', 'melt', 'crusty', 'deep-freeze', 'enveloped', 'years.Every', 'time', 'Kowalski', 'wittingly', 'unwittingly', 'neighbours', 'gang', 'members', 'flooded', 'food', 'flower', 'offerings', 'gifts', 'gratitude', 'Hmongs', 'ward', 'off', 'Eventually', 'accepts', 'even', 'enjoying', 'them..', 'when', 'gang', 'members', 'perform', 'attack', 'enormous', 'magnitude', 'family', 'who', 'are', 'too', 'afraid', 'go', 'police', 'Kowalski', 'maverick', 'not', 'afraid', 'take', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'making', 'sure', 'family', 'protected', 'own', 'affairs', 'are', 'order.There', 'are', 'other', 'sub-plots', 'explain', 'much', 'Kowalski', 'are', 'tied', 'up', 'neatly', 'movie', 'not', 'flaws', 'are', 'relatively', 'small', 'ones', 'Overall', 'very', 'satisfying', 'movie', 'kind', 'want', 'stand', 'up', 'cheer', 'afterwards']",Gran Torino

In this case, it's the day Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) lays his wife Dorothy to rest.  You see the typical Catholic funeral and wake with the very traditional Walt far distanced from his sons and their kids.He's even more distanced from Fr. Janovich (Christopher Carley) the parish priest, who made a promise to Mrs. Kowalski before she died that he'd make sure Walt got to confession.Walt's response to the priest: ""I think you're an overeducated 27-year-old virgin who likes to hold the hands of superstitious old ladies and promise them everlasting life.""Once the family's gone, we see Walt's the last remaining resident in a lovely old neighborhood that's become an Asian ghetto. The mutli-generation Vietnamese family next door has problems of their own.  Young Thao (Bee Vang) is being recruited by the local gang.  His sister Sue (Ahney Her) is getting hustled by young men who only want to use her as a pretty face.You're going to hear a lot of racial epithets from an old man who fought in Korea. His neighbors look like the enemy who haunt his dreams and as he says to one gang member: ""I used to stack @#$* like you, five feet high in Korea, use ya for sand bags.""Yet, as time goes by Walt comes to know his neighbors and his neighborhood.  He sees the war between people trying to live their lives honestly and the gangs who'd steal that honest living and not look back. Walt's gradually assimilated into this community and the 'old dog learns a few tricks' as well as teaching some strength and courage to young Thao.""Gran Torino"" is the best Clint Eastwood film I have seen so far.

1209146,ABFQUOV57SWOR,B001KVZ6ES,robb1138,"[5, 5]","I had seen ""Gran Torino"" when it first came out in theaters: however, I took a second look at this film when it came to DVD, because my initial impression kept haunting me.  I have to say that I liked this movie very much.  I liked the story, a lost young man looking for his place in the world finding a mentor in the most unlikely of characters.  Filmed on location in Michigan, Clint Eastwood, directed and stars as a crusty widower, Korean vet, detached from his adult children and their family's, living out his days in a neighborhood settled mostly by Hmong people.  Newcomers to the screen are fledging actors, Bee Vang and Ahney Her, plus an appearance by Clint's son, Scott Eastwood has the small part of Trey (as Scott Reeves).  This movie is about change and values, about knowing who you are, and who you want to be.Walt uses just about every racist term he can think of in this film.  His new neighbors consist of an Asian family consisting of a grandmother, her daughter, and her daughter's two children, Sue and Thao.  One characteristic between Americans and just about any other race is the matter of family.  Walter Kowalski, his two sons, moved out long ago, rarely visit, sits alone on his porch all day drinking beer and eating beef jerky.  On the other hand, his Asian neighbors have family and friends constantly visiting, bringing food and having family celebrations.  The movie focuses on Thao and his sister Sue as second-generation immigrants trying to find a niche in this country.  Thao, around 16, living in a female dominated household, content to read and garden, activities considered in Asian society as woman's work, is visibly lost.  His sister Sue, a few years older, describes their environment concisely, ""the women go to college the boys, go to jail.""  Matters worsen for Thao when his cousin, Spider approaches him to join his gang and receive protection from the other gangs.  The initiation to join the gang is to steal his neighbor, Walt's 1972 Gran Torino.  Thao botches the auto theft and runs home.  Too dark to see who was trying to steal his prize, Walt is unaware that it is his own neighbor, Thao.  The next evening, Spider and his gang come to give Thao another chance, but the boy's sister, mother, and grandmother interfere.  Spiders, gang of dropouts try to take Thao forcibly.  In the midst of the ruckus, Walt, armed with his army issue M1 Garand comes out Dirty Harry style and saves the day.  As the reluctant hero to the Hmong community, his neighbors shower him with gifts of flowers and food, arriving on his porch daily.  Sue, her mother, and Thao insist that Thao repays Walt for trying to steal his car by working for him.  Reluctantly, as Walt does not want anything to do with these people, agrees to the work arrangement and the two of them begin a journey together that make this an excellent movie.  The other character to watch for is Thao's sister Sue, although a stronger, smarter character than her brother, she too is a victim of her environment.Right away, the acting of two supporting characters will come in question.  I say the supporting cast played their parts strong, and added a depth to the story, the human element.  Bee Vang's portrayal of Thao at times seems awkward, out of place and lost.  Teenaged boys, growing up without a strong male role model, are awkward, out of place and are certainly lost.  Bee Vang is a natural for this part.Like the Dirty Harry movies, the Spaghetti westerns of Eastwood's early films, or even Pale Rider, or ""the Unforgiven,"" this movie stands out for the journey that each of the character make toward finding themselves.  Walt, Thao, Sue, Sue's grandmother, Father Janovich, and even Spider and his gang.  Each of the characters, making this journey of self discovery ties together throughout the movie by one thing, Walter Kowalski's 1972 Gran Torino.  The 1972 Gran Torino that Walt installed the steering column as it rolled out of the factory.  The Gran Torino that Thao attempted to steal, the Gran Torino that is the envy of the town, the Gran Torino that Walt's inconsiderate granddaughter asks for when he dies.  The Gran Torino that Thao must wash as part of his penitence, the Gran Torino that Walt allowed Thao drives his first date to the prom.  In the reading of Walt's Last Will & Testament, the Gran Torino does not go to his granddaughter, Ashley, who is an insensitive brat.  Instead, Walt gives the Gran Torino to Thao.  The Gran Torino gives Thao the opportunity for a new life.  The car, like Walt is an antique, a reminder of the past.I wanted my kids to see this movie in spite of the swearing and racial slurs.",4,Have you met someone you shouldn't have F$#ked with?,1271030400,"04 12, 2010",2010,4655,"['had', 'seen', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'theaters', 'however', 'took', 'second', 'look', 'film', 'when', 'came', 'DVD', 'initial', 'impression', 'kept', 'haunting', 'have', 'say', 'liked', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'liked', 'story', 'lost', 'young', 'man', 'looking', 'place', 'world', 'finding', 'mentor', 'most', 'unlikely', 'characters', 'Filmed', 'location', 'Michigan', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'directed', 'stars', 'crusty', 'widower', 'Korean', 'vet', 'detached', 'adult', 'children', 'family', 'living', 'out', 'days', 'neighborhood', 'settled', 'mostly', 'Hmong', 'people', 'Newcomers', 'screen', 'are', 'fledging', 'actors', 'Bee', 'Vang', 'Ahney', 'Her', 'appearance', 'Clint', 'son', 'Scott', 'Eastwood', 'small', 'part', 'Trey', 'Scott', 'Reeves', 'movie', 'change', 'values', 'knowing', 'who', 'are', 'who', 'want', 'be.Walt', 'uses', 'just', 'racist', 'term', 'can', 'think', 'film', 'new', 'neighbors', 'consist', 'Asian', 'family', 'consisting', 'grandmother', 'daughter', 'daughter', 'two', 'children', 'Sue', 'Thao', 'One', 'characteristic', 'Americans', 'just', 'other', 'race', 'matter', 'family', 'Walter', 'Kowalski', 'two', 'sons', 'moved', 'out', 'long', 'ago', 'rarely', 'visit', 'alone', 'porch', 'day', 'drinking', 'beer', 'eating', 'beef', 'jerky', 'other', 'hand', 'Asian', 'neighbors', 'have', 'family', 'friends', 'constantly', 'visiting', 'bringing', 'food', 'having', 'family', 'celebrations', 'movie', 'Thao', 'sister', 'Sue', 'second-generation', 'immigrants', 'trying', 'find', 'niche', 'country', 'Thao', '16', 'living', 'female', 'dominated', 'household', 'content', 'read', 'garden', 'activities', 'considered', 'Asian', 'society', 'woman', 'work', 'visibly', 'lost', 'sister', 'Sue', 'few', 'years', 'older', 'describes', 'environment', 'concisely', 'women', 'go', 'college', 'boys', 'go', 'jail', 'Matters', 'worsen', 'Thao', 'when', 'cousin', 'Spider', 'join', 'gang', 'receive', 'protection', 'other', 'gangs', 'initiation', 'join', 'gang', 'steal', 'neighbor', 'Walt', '1972', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'Thao', 'auto', 'theft', 'home', 'Too', 'dark', 'see', 'who', 'was', 'trying', 'steal', 'prize', 'Walt', 'unaware', 'own', 'neighbor', 'Thao', 'next', 'evening', 'Spider', 'gang', 'come', 'give', 'Thao', 'chance', 'boy', 'sister', 'mother', 'grandmother', 'interfere', 'Spiders', 'gang', 'dropouts', 'try', 'take', 'Thao', 'forcibly', 'midst', 'ruckus', 'Walt', 'armed', 'army', 'issue', 'M1', 'Garand', 'out', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'style', 'day', 'reluctant', 'hero', 'Hmong', 'community', 'neighbors', 'shower', 'gifts', 'flowers', 'food', 'arriving', 'porch', 'daily', 'Sue', 'mother', 'Thao', 'insist', 'Thao', 'Walt', 'trying', 'steal', 'car', 'working', 'Reluctantly', 'Walt', 'not', 'want', 'anything', 'do', 'people', 'work', 'arrangement', 'two', 'begin', 'journey', 'together', 'make', 'excellent', 'movie', 'other', 'character', 'watch', 'Thao', 'sister', 'Sue', 'stronger', 'smarter', 'character', 'brother', 'too', 'victim', 'environment.Right', 'away', 'acting', 'two', 'supporting', 'characters', 'will', 'come', 'question', 'say', 'supporting', 'cast', 'played', 'parts', 'strong', 'added', 'depth', 'story', 'human', 'element', 'Bee', 'Vang', 'portrayal', 'Thao', 'times', 'awkward', 'place', 'lost', 'Teenaged', 'boys', 'growing', 'up', 'strong', 'male', 'role', 'model', 'are', 'awkward', 'place', 'are', 'certainly', 'lost', 'Bee', 'Vang', 'natural', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'movies', 'Spaghetti', 'westerns', 'Eastwood', 'early', 'films', 'even', 'Pale', 'Rider', 'Unforgiven', 'movie', 'out', 'journey', 'character', 'make', 'finding', 'Walt', 'Thao', 'Sue', 'Sue', 'grandmother', 'Father', 'Janovich', 'even', 'Spider', 'gang', 'characters', 'making', 'journey', 'self', 'discovery', 'together', 'movie', 'one', 'thing', 'Walter', 'Kowalski', '1972', 'Gran', 'Torino', '1972', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'Walt', 'installed', 'steering', 'column', 'rolled', 'out', 'factory', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'Thao', 'attempted', 'steal', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'envy', 'town', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'Walt', 'inconsiderate', 'granddaughter', 'asks', 'when', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'Thao', 'must', 'wash', 'part', 'penitence', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'Walt', 'allowed', 'Thao', 'first', 'date', 'prom', 'reading', 'Walt', 'Last', 'Will', 'Testament', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'not', 'go', 'granddaughter', 'Ashley', 'who', 'insensitive', 'brat', 'Instead', 'Walt', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'Thao', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'Thao', 'opportunity', 'new', 'life', 'car', 'Walt', 'antique', 'reminder', 'past.I', 'wanted', 'kids', 'see', 'movie', 'spite', 'swearing', 'racial', 'slurs']",Gran Torino

While I think it is too easy to describe him as a racist, he is of the glib, crusty, irascible curmugeon type.  Indeed, he reminds me of my father - hard-edged and seemingly offensive (some people would get hurt and insulted, to be sure), but in fact with a good heart and natural nobility.  Eastwood plays it with unmistakable charisma.  I marvelled at the skill with which Eastwood pealed away layers of his character, from his crudeness to his soul-searching and ethic of community.The situation is that, his wife having died and his sons alienated, he is wondering what to do with himself.  He is rude to his Hmong neighbors, but comes to see them as truly worthy people in need of help and nurturing.  His evolution from suspicion and a playful hostility with the Hmong grandmother are totally believable.  In particular, he befirends a boy who is at a crossroads, even taking him to a barber in order to teach him how to trade manly insults.  Their chemistry as it evolves is beautiful, to the point of bringing tears to my eyes.  When his plans to help go awry, he hatches a very clever plan.I watched this twice and was moved each time and noticed more detail.  It is a masterpiece and an unusual story for Hollywood to do.

1209149,A1SBRISKS7PH7U,B001KVZ6ES,Rob,"[2, 2]","This great script about personal redemption & the values that unite us, regardless of race, is not only laugh out loud hilarious thanks to more instantly quotable one-liners than I can recall in any movie from recent years, but also incredibly moving.Unlike so many other directors who showboat their style in a 'Hey Ma, look at me! I'm directing a movie!' kind of way, Eastwood's direction is like a gentle breeze, it's so light, so delicate, you're barely even aware of it. Instead you're right where you want to be be; engrossed in the story & gripped by these wonderful characters. And what a story!Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) is an elderly widower surrounded by Hmong immigrants with foreign ways that he despises, living in a decrepit neighborhood & pestered by his own ghastly family who can't wait to shove him into a retirement home so they can grab his house. He keeps his own home & property neatly tendered, in stark contrast to those around him. Walt is, in effect, the proverbial civilised man surrounded by the barbarians.But when Tao, the shy Hmong kid from next door is pressured by a local gang into trying to steal Walt's beloved Gran Torino, the stage is set for a culture clash. That Walt ends up befriending Tao probably won't come as a surprise but the exact manner in which Walt warms to his Hmong neighbors, his mysterious guilt over an incident from his Korean war days, how Tao learns to stand on his own two feet & the presence of the Hmong gang who haven't forgotten Tao, are developed & resolved in wholly unexpected ways. We think we know where this is going simply because we've all seen Eastwood films before. But just as he did with Million Dollar Baby, Eastwood has one heck of a surprise in store, an ending that not only cuts deep but makes perfect sense & in ways we had not anticipated.To say more would spoil the fun but Eastwood's fearless, pull no punches approach to race & culture is an absolute blast from start to finish, & Eastwood the actor is electrifying in the lead role. There is something thrilling in the way a nearly 80 yr old man can hold the screen so effortlessly. Other stars lose charisma as they age but Eastwood's only seems to increase. As one reviewer noted, this is possibly the only film in the history of American cinema in which a 78 yr old man convincingly kicks the ass of a guy 60 years his junior!Aside from Clint the young cast of non-professional Hmong actors are all fine with Bee Vang (Tao), & Ahney Herr (Sue), believable & likable as the young Hmong teens next door. They have an un-Hollywood quality to them that makes their performances pleasingly natural & amongst the professional cast Christopher Carley (as Fthr Janovitch) & John Carroll Lynch (Martin the Barber) are excellent.I don't believe for a second that this is Eastwood's final screen performance & after Gran Torino's huge success - it ranks as Eastwood's most profitable film ever at the box-office - the studios doubtless can't get enough scripts to him fast enough. But if it is then Eastwood has found a role that's the perfect capstone to the urban tough guys he's so memorably played over the decades.When Walt walks off to that final showdown, quite willing to go to the wall for those who share his values, it's impossible not to sense the ghosts of Harry Callahan & The Man With No Name walking with him.

This doesn't mean he ignores women or downplays their role in the world--far from it. But from the spaghetti westerns to ""The Unforgiven"", from the ""Dirty Harry"" movies to the one being reviewed here, ""Gran Torino"", the focus is on men and how they behave (or misbehave).""Gran Torino"" is about a ""last man standing"" in a sense. Walter Kowalski (are we supposed to think of Walter Chrysler?) is the last of a generation of white men who supported his family and defined his life in the auto works of The Motor City. But the complexion of the city (pun intended) has changed over the decades. His Gran Torino, which he rebuilt, is his link to the past. How he defends it, and by ""it"" I mean everything he has ever stood for, is a polar opposite of the weak-willed young man next door, Thao. In fact, Walt goes out of his way to teach him ""guy"" stuff, whether it's guy talk at the barber or buying hand tools (not power tools--important difference) or defending himself against thugs. Walt didn't get this message across to his own son but he tries with Thao, which I thought was important. Walt's continued dispute with Catholicism only emphasizes Walt's sense of rugged, male individuality.Now, Thao's sister, Sue... she's another story. No fear of confrontation for her. She is as in-your-face and brutally honest as Walter. And this is what I meant earlier, when I said that Eastwood doesn't downplay the role of women. Think of Maggie in ""Million Dollar Baby"" or Annabeth in ""Mystic River"". Toughness is a universal in Clint's world, it just seems that men need to be reminded of it and how to use it correctly.

Clint Eastwood plays an aging Korean War veteran who, after seeing combat in Korea, worked on the Ford assembly lines until he retired.  His particular neighborhood has slowly become predominately Vietnamese, and this culture at first neither appeals to him any more than his new neighbors understand him.  Slowly, however, each side comes to appreciate the virtues of the other and therein lies a humorous but also poignant storyline.  Clint Eastwood turns in his usual stellar job as the grouchy, politically-incorrect ""Walt"".  The big surprise here is that the mostly unknown Vietnamese cast is extremely good and they turn in excellent performances as well.There are some ethnic slurs in this film and normally I do not approve of such.  Perhaps the film could have dispensed with this, but who am I to second-guess Clint Eastwood?

1209155,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B001KVZ6ES,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 4]","**SPOILERS**Growing old certainly seems to agree with Clint Eastwood.  For popular as he was at the box office, Eastwood, in the early stages of his career at least, never seemed entirely comfortable in an actor's skin - his performances often coming across as stiff and wooden as he mumbled his way through perpetually clenched teeth and the barest minimum of dialogue (it wasn't for no reason that critics always seemed to describe his early characters as ""laconic"").  Yet, now that he's encased in an old man's body, that stiffness couldn't be more organic to the characters he's playing - or more effortlessly natural.  In ""Gran Turino,"" Eastwood returns for one last time to the role of the lone gunslinger - whether it be on  the western frontier as the Man With No Name or on the meanest of urban mean streets as Dirty Harry - that made him an icon for a generation of moviegoers who grew up on his films.  Yet, it is a return tempered by the kind of wisdom and restraint that only age and a lifetime's worth of experience can bring.Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski, a septuagenarian who is practically the walking definition of a grumpy old man.  A Korean War vet still haunted by the memories of what he saw and did there, Walt is a prickly, snarling, irreligious cynic who doesn't much cotton to the informality and lax standards of the modern world.  He also happens to be the most ""lovable"" bigot to come our way since Archie Bunker, a thoroughgoing racist who doesn't hesitate to spit out every politically incorrect epithet he can lay his hands on when the situation calls for it (although, in all fairness, he doesn`t hesitate to refer to himself as a ""Pollack"" from time to time as well).  The key thing to understand about Walt, however, is that while he may be filled with venomous hatred for much of his fellow Man, he knows how to cut through a line of BS when he hears it (much to the consternation of the neighborhood priest who keeps offering Walt salvation through confession).  Distraught at the loss of his beloved wife, Walt wages a one-man war against the army of immigrants that has ""invaded"" his formerly all-white, lower middle class neighborhood in recent years.  Walt is particularly irked by the Asian family who's moved in next door, until he's befriended by the teenage daughter, who slowly and cautiously brings him into their world.  Walt, in turn, takes her younger brother under his wing, helping him stand up to the gang members who taunt and threaten him on almost a daily basis.""Gran Torino"" is fraught with any number of potential pitfalls, all of which are deftly sidestepped by Nick Schenk's screenplay, Eastwood's direction and, most notably, Eastwood's performance in the starring role.  The image of an old man single-handedly staring down a bunch of hardcore gangbangers could easily have elicited laughs under other circumstances, but because Eastwood draws upon our cherished memories of his well established image as a tough guy, we are able to suspend our disbelief and accept it all at face value.  This is one time when the audience's previous familiarity with and affection for an actor truly pays off in a big way.  Moreover, even though we know where the story is going - that this unyielding curmudgeon will eventually be won over and softened by his experience with this alien culture and the people in it - the easygoing tone of the film keeps it from becoming preachy or mawkish.  In fact, what strikes one most is just how funny so much of this movie turns out to be, and this is due almost exclusively to Eastwood's sly, often playful performance.  With a disarming cynic's grin and a sardonic twinkle in his eye, Eastwood makes a potentially one-note character into a fully fleshed-out human being.For while the other performances in the film are uneven at best, ""Gran Torino"" contains the best work Eastwood has ever done on screen.  The movie serves as a valedictory of sorts for a man whose most recent movie triumphs have all taken place on the other side of the camera.  This role is like that last walk the hero takes down the middle of main street before heading off into the sunset.

Perhaps, the most deeply felt of his traumas, is his experience during the Korean War in which he killed...at least...thirteen of the oriental enemy, some little more than kids.  They were a lot like, or so Kowalski painfully speculates, his young Hmong friend.This is a tale not so much about redemption [although it could be confused as such] as a tale about the difficulty of interpreting...or judging...a person by his surface demeanor.  Kowalski is in a very real sense, every man, grown bitter and cynical with age.  He is us, filled with the prejudices which...despite all our denials...structure all of us.  Despite this, Kowalski, again like most of us, is a thoroughly decent human being.  He reacts to injustice but, like very few of us, he does something about it.He attempts to protect his Hmong neighbors from hoodlums.  Unfortunately, one of his actions against these punks results in reprisals in the form of a driveby shooting and a brutal rape.  Disgusted with himself and even more disgusted with the gang members, Kowalski acts deciseively to end the terror and protect 'his' oriental family.  It is, perhaps, not the ending favored by most Eastwood fans, but is all the more potent because of its simplicity.I enjoy he way Eastwood deals with 'racism' in this film.

It's almost as if Eastwood placed himself at a carnival shooting gallery, with the bad guys popping up at predictable intervals for him to shoot down. The gang of hooligan Hmong teens pop up to try to roust their cousin to join their gang. Then they pop up to roust the young female teen in the family. As in Death Wish, there almost seem to be too many timed gang threats for the lead character to prove himself against.Then Eastwood's film children pop up in predictable, self-seeking fashion to urge him into the dullness of a retirement home. He shoots down these threats in turn - not with a gun this time, but verbally.There is also a certain predictability to the character that Eastwood plays. He is the gruff Archie Bunker bigot with a heart of gold. However, he does evolve, albeit again, a little too neatly on cue.But the film ultimately takes the viewer to some interesting places. And we learn something about the Hmong culture along the way. The Hmong are a group of Southeast Asian hill people whose story has rarely been told on the screen.There is no Director's commentary on this DVD, but there are a couple of bonus features centering on the 1972 Gran Torino that's the star of this film, and on classic muscle cars in general. Some of the men involved in the making of this movie and some others reminisce about their first cars and their dream cars. We get to see a Detroit rally of classic cars along Woodward Avenue in the process - an especially poignant parade since the Detroit scene has so altered in the months since this movie was released.With all these elements - insight into Hmong culture, classic cars, and a new dimension to classic Eastwood toughness - there are a number of reasons to check out this DVD.",3,Smells a Little Like a Set-Up,1244678400,"06 11, 2009",2009,1817,"['somewhat', 'interesting', 'movie', 'little', 'too', 'pat', 'places', 'almost', 'Eastwood', 'placed', 'carnival', 'shooting', 'gallery', 'bad', 'guys', 'popping', 'up', 'predictable', 'intervals', 'shoot', 'down', 'gang', 'hooligan', 'Hmong', 'teens', 'pop', 'up', 'try', 'roust', 'cousin', 'join', 'gang', 'Then', 'pop', 'up', 'roust', 'young', 'female', 'teen', 'family', 'Death', 'Wish', 'almost', 'seem', 'be', 'too', 'many', 'timed', 'gang', 'threats', 'lead', 'character', 'prove', 'against.Then', 'Eastwood', 'film', 'children', 'pop', 'up', 'predictable', 'self-seeking', 'fashion', 'urge', 'dullness', 'retirement', 'home', 'shoots', 'threats', 'turn', 'not', 'gun', 'time', 'verbally.There', 'also', 'certain', 'predictability', 'character', 'Eastwood', 'gruff', 'Archie', 'Bunker', 'bigot', 'heart', 'gold', 'However', 'evolve', 'albeit', 'again', 'little', 'too', 'neatly', 'cue.But', 'film', 'ultimately', 'viewer', 'interesting', 'places', 'learn', 'something', 'Hmong', 'culture', 'way', 'Hmong', 'are', 'group', 'Southeast', 'Asian', 'hill', 'people', 'story', 'rarely', 'been', 'told', 'screen.There', 'Director', 'commentary', 'DVD', 'are', 'couple', 'bonus', 'features', 'centering', '1972', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'star', 'film', 'classic', 'muscle', 'cars', 'general', 'men', 'involved', 'making', 'movie', 'others', 'reminisce', 'first', 'cars', 'dream', 'cars', 'get', 'see', 'Detroit', 'rally', 'classic', 'cars', 'Woodward', 'Avenue', 'process', 'especially', 'poignant', 'parade', 'Detroit', 'scene', 'so', 'altered', 'months', 'movie', 'was', 'released.With', 'elements', 'insight', 'Hmong', 'culture', 'classic', 'cars', 'new', 'dimension', 'classic', 'Eastwood', 'toughness', 'are', 'number', 'reasons', 'check', 'out', 'DVD']",Gran Torino
1209163,ANBOOQR5NVJPM,B001KVZ6ES,S. A DUNN,"[4, 4]","We all have gotten to know Clint Eastwood through his handiwork.  The countless early Western TV shows and movies he starred in introduced him to us.  His role changed from Star to Superstar in his epic depictions of ""Dirty Harry,"" the hard boiled Inspector of Homicide.  Since those days, we have seen his excellence as a director in many more excellent dramas and Westerns.Although controversial, we peered into his morality and sense of caring above and beyond the cultural senses of morality in Million Dollar Baby.And now, at the age where you would think that Dirty Harry would be merely lolling in retirement, drinking his beer and smoking his cigarettes on a front porch, Clint Eastwood directs and stars in a movie where he IS in retirement drinking beer and smoking cigarettes on the front porch, snarling at everyone, his neighbors, his war experiences, and his own family!In Gran Torino, he shows that it is possible to teach an old dog new tricks.  Ever steeped in hatreds, bigotries and racial stereotyping, he is slowly changed by his Hmong immigrant neighbors.  As he takes a young teenage Hmong under his wing (although in the beginning it was done to protect the only thing he truly loves, his vintage, mint condition 1972 Gran Torino,) he steers young Thao away from the aimless Gang-bangers and ""Mans"" Thao up.  (Accordingly to his learned, inherited flawed standards.)  While doing so, he discovers that on the human emotional side, he truly has a lot more in common with the Immigrant Ethics than he has with his own kin!As ""Walt"" softens and learns to appreciate the Immigrant's generosity and hospitality, we see the true heart of our ""Dirty Harry.""  He has more purpose in life now than just hating everyone and loving his Gran Torino.  When young Thao is ""man enough"" to go on a date, Walt even lets the young man (who preciously tried to steal his True Love) use his Gran Torino to take the young girl out on a date in style!And when the neighborhood gang threaten and try to kill the immigrant family, Walt lets out the Dirty Harry in himself, and sacrifices himself to protect the people who have adopted the ""crusty old bastard"" as one of them!Walt's last request was to give Thao his Gran Torino.  In the last scene when we see Thao driving Walt's old Gran Torino, the car with the grille that scowled like Walt used to do, the joy on Thao's face reveals that not only is Thao driving Walt's soul. but Walt's soul has been transplanted in young Thao!If anything that Clint Eastwood has done in this movie that is worthwhile is this:  To show how, in a changing America, that by embracing and celebrating the diversity in this country we all strengthen what this country is all about in the first place!

1209166,A6FIAB28IS79,B001KVZ6ES,Samuel Chell,"[3, 5]","After reflection, discussion and further reflection, I'm raising my rating from  4 to 5 stars for this late-career Eastwood achievement.  Of the films I've seen in the new millennium, ""There Will Be Blood"" stands out as the most ""artful""--a nuanced, complex, serious piece of moviemaking that pulls out all the stops--scripting, acting, and cinematography (above all, the creative, even daring, use of montage and mis en scene to ""tell the story"" rather than the usual reliance on script, close-ups, and talking heads).  By contrast, ""Gran Torino"" breaks no new ground and demands far less of its viewer as a reader of film per se: instead, it demands a viewer who can handle a serious social issue and accept as ""heroes"" characters largely viewed as non-sympathetic by the majority of the American public.  But above all, ""Gran Torino"" required a director with Eastwood's deep convictions about fair play and his sympathies with the underdog--so much so that he was willing to put his name and money on the line regardless of the outcome at the box office.I viewed the film at the recommendation of my son, who no doubt was, like most viewers, initially attracted to it by the title.  Equally certain is that he, like most viewers, was moved by more than the car (though it's a nice car, not unlike a few big old Fords we've had in the family).  But the actual subjects in this film are tolerance, redemption and community--and Eastwood, as is his custom, finds it in an unlikely place--or rather, among an unfamiliar people--the much misunderstood, maligned, and even demonized Hmong people.  Clint's character is that of a crusty old Korean war veteran who interprets the world around him according to the bible of Archie Bunker, stereotyping people at every opportunity, cracking politically-incorrect jokes, and talking in a profane and scatological argot ironically not unlike that of the young minority gang-bangers he views as a nemesis. The primary ""action"" is not the predictable violence, beating and shooting stemming from the vigilante justice that is a trademark of Eastwood films but the conversion of Clint from flint to ""father""--not of his distant, materialistic biological children but of a Hmong boy who suffers from low self-esteem while seeking significance and stability among even his own people.  Eastwood's character and the Hmong boy (originally an unwelcome neighbor who lives next door to the recently widowed Eastwood who, with the exception of his old dog Daisy, experiences a chosen isolation not all that different from the boy's).  Eventually, Eastwood becomes a virtual family member among the Hmongs and gets the son he never had (though at the price of his life), and the Hmong boy in turn gets an affirming father along with the latter's coveted '72 Gran Torino and, through his newly acquired self-confidence, the Hmong girl he had been too shy to look at, much less go after.These are commendable sentiments, and even without the twist of the Hmong neighbors, Eastwood's skills both as a director and actor assure a result that rises above the plot of what is basically a formulaic film, with a number of developments most likely conveyed to a good share of the audience well before they occur.  What's somewhat regrettable is the appearance of the film at a time when the nation is so splintered (bifurcated, may be the word) into two camps, one respecting poltical process and the highest office, the other seemingly thinking some sort of vigilante justice is a defense against terrorism rather than a contributor to it.  It's appalling to read polls suggesting that half of the nation has regressed to two ""basic needs"": Give me my guns, and don't tax me.  Even more disturbing is reading of political rallies to which people are drawn while packing firearms.  (Undeniably, that's one solution to the current problems with the economy and its failure to provide sufficient jobs: kill enough people, and eventually demand will come into closer alignment with supply.)In literature courses, teachers often try to discourage students from falling victim to the ""intentional fallacy"" (""Shakespeare wrote to entertain theater-goers and REALLY meant to say to be or not to be a ticket buyer is the question""; or ""You're making too big a deal out of the poem.  Maybe all Frost meant to say was that he went on a walk, came to a fork, and took the less-traveled one to be different."").  But once a literary piece (or film) is born, it takes on a life of its own.  Attempts to read the author's mind are naiive, presumptuous and beside the point.  So even though Eastwood's character ends up with a cigarette lighter in his right hand rather than the magnum pistol it's assumed he's reaching for, the strange hold that guns have, especially on Americans, the potential of guns to ""equalize"" us all, quickly and decisively, is a stronger, more lingering image, I'm afraid, than the restored Gran Torino.  If Eastwood makes one more film (he had vowed before ""Gran Torino"" to do no more acting), I can't imagine a stronger, more valuable or memorable closer than a movie exposing guns for the anachronisms they have become in a civilized society.  But given his love of jazz and American music, I know that he would support, instead of guns in young people's hands, a musical instrument, preferably one that is not a synthesizer.I viewed the film in Blu Ray, though Eastwood's preference for a ""noirish"" cast, even to his color tones (witness a first-class Eastwood film noir gem like ""Tightrope"" from 1985), makes normal DVD an equally compelling choice.[Coda: An undeniable item of curiosity (apart from its critical importance to the plot) is the cigarette lighter that replaces the handgun in Eastwood's final scene.  At a point midway in the film we see him coughing up blood, and a comment by the Hmong boy (or is it his sister?) that he should stop smoking strongly implies that he's suffering from lung cancer (given his stubborn character, a doctor would be the last to know).  So either way--a gun or a lighter--the object in his left shirt pocket is emblematic of his end, the only question being whether it will be instantaneous or prolonged. It's even plausible that he knows his days are numbered and chooses what he believes is the best way out for all concerned.]",5,A college film instructor weighs in,1257033600,"11 1,

1209174,A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ,B001KVZ6ES,Sean Pasek,"[3, 3]","Walt Kowalski is a man who seems nearly impossible to get along with.  His kids make attempts (albeit poor ones), his self-involved granddaughter, and even a 27-year-old ""virgin"" Catholic priest.  It seems that the only person who had any kind of deep connection with him, was his wife.  Any of us who have never been involved in a war, couldn't possibly understand what it does to a person.  It becomes clear that Walt is carrying tremendous guilt about the things he's done in the Korean War.  He can't let it go.  He buries himself in his anger and contempt for nearly everyone else, especially including a Hmong family who has moved in next door.Right from the get-go, it's clear that Walt can't stand them.  They remind him too much of the people he fought against in Korea.  Walt is so used to insulting nearly everyone he meets, that it's practically second nature to him.  It's his defense mechanism, so that he can never have to have a deep connection with anyone.  The only people who can stand him are a couple of drinking buddies at a bar, the town barber, and the town construction supervisor.One night, Thao, the young son of the Hmong family, is pressured by a Hmong gang to attempt to steal Walt's car (the 1972 Gran Torino) as part of a gang initiation.  Walt catches him in the act, which only seems to cement his hatred of them.  When Thao resists doing anything else for the gang, he is threatened by them, and lo and behold, his ""savior"" happens to be Walt holding an old-style rifle used in the Korea War.  Walt, of course, couldn't care less about Thao, but simply wants them all off his lawn.  Little does Walt realize, that this simple act of protection has opened a door, he never sees.Sue is Thao's older sister.  It's clear that she likes Walt, despite his offensive remarks.  Through Sue, Walt begins to find a connection with the Hmong.  ""I have more in common with these people than I do my own family!"" he quips.  He's invited to a Hmong gathering, and strange enough to Walt, he's enjoying himself.  Thao is forced to do odd-jobs for Walt to pay off his debt for his attempt to steal Walt's car.  This gives Walt yet another connection...ironically enough to the boy who attempted to steal his car.  Walt sees that Thao isn't like the kids in the Hmong gang, but that this boy actually has a chance to do something with his life.  Walt realizes that this probably won't happen as long as the Hmong gang continues to terrorize Thao and his family.Clint Eastwood is arguably one of the best directors in the business.  Some people have complained about the acting of the Hmong cast.  I didn't have a problem with it.  They aren't professional actors, and that is okay.  Instead, it's as if they are simply playing themselves.  Their lines almost seem improvisational and not from a script.  For this film, it works well.  I was especially impressed by young Ahney Her (Sue).  I felt that she wonderfully created the bridge between Sue and Walt.  She's tough, and yet kind and sensitive.  That is a pretty good balance to achieve for a first-time actress.Walt Kowalski is carrying a heavy burden of guilt.  The priest attempts to help Walt, but as Walt explains to him, ""You know nothing about life and death, kid.""  The priest realizes that Walt is correct.  The priest has never been in a war, nor has ever been asked to take a life because it was his job; and to learn to hate a group of people to help you perform that job.  Like a poison, the anger and guilt is eating Walt up.  Despite what Walt says to the contrary, it's evident that Walt loves Sue and Thao as if they were his own kids.  He helps them, looks after them, and protects them from something he never wants them to ever have to be a part of.Gran Torino is Clint Eastwood's last acting job, and boy, does he end his illustrious career with an incredible film.  It's about the power of redemption; about finding a way of excising yourself of the demons that nearly everyone carries; and how holding on to that guilt, eats you up like a cancer.  Some scenes are difficult to watch, and strangely enough, we get used to Walt's constant racial slurs.  I think the reason for this is, that to most of the audience who knows and understands Walt Kowalski, he doesn't really mean it.  He simply doesn't know any other way to communicate.Gran Torino may not seem like a masterpiece, but is really comes close.  For Eastwood's final curtain call, Gran Torino has a lot of power in its message, and many may well view it as a masterpiece.",5,The Power of Redemption In Clint Eastwood's Curtain Call As An Actor,1272326400,"04 27, 2010",2010,4528,"['Walt', 'Kowalski', 'man', 'who', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'get', 'kids', 'make', 'attempts', 'poor', 'ones', 'self-involved', 'granddaughter', 'even', '27-year-old', 'virgin', 'Catholic', 'priest', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'had', 'kind', 'deep', 'connection', 'was', 'wife', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'involved', 'war', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'understand', 'what', 'person', 'clear', 'Walt', 'carrying', 'tremendous', 'guilt', 'things', 'done', 'Korean', 'War', 'ca', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'anger', 'contempt', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'else', 'especially', 'including', 'Hmong', 'family', 'who', 'moved', 'next', 'door.Right', 'get-go', 'clear', 'Walt', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'remind', 'too', 'much', 'people', 'fought', 'Korea', 'Walt', 'so', 'used', 'insulting', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'practically', 'second', 'nature', 'defense', 'mechanism', 'so', 'can', 'never', 'have', 'have', 'deep', 'connection', 'anyone', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'can', 'stand', 'are', 'couple', 'drinking', 'buddies', 'bar', 'town', 'barber', 'town', 'construction', 'supervisor.One', 'night', 'Thao', 'young', 'son', 'Hmong', 'family', 'pressured', 'Hmong', 'gang', 'attempt', 'steal', 'Walt', 'car', '1972', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'part', 'gang', 'initiation', 'Walt', 'act', 'only', 'cement', 'hatred', 'When', 'Thao', 'doing', 'anything', 'else', 'gang', 'threatened', 'lo', 'behold', 'savior', 'be', 'Walt', 'holding', 'old-style', 'rifle', 'used', 'Korea', 'War', 'Walt', 'course', 'could', ""n't"", 'care', 'less', 'Thao', 'simply', 'lawn', 'Little', 'Walt', 'realize', 'simple', 'act', 'protection', 'opened', 'door', 'never', 'sees.Sue', 'Thao', 'older', 'sister', 'clear', 'Walt', 'offensive', 'remarks', 'Sue', 'Walt', 'find', 'connection', 'Hmong', 'have', 'more', 'common', 'people', 'do', 'own', 'family', 'invited', 'Hmong', 'gathering', 'strange', 'enough', 'Walt', 'enjoying', 'Thao', 'forced', 'do', 'odd-jobs', 'Walt', 'pay', 'off', 'debt', 'attempt', 'steal', 'Walt', 'car', 'Walt', 'yet', 'connection', 'ironically', 'enough', 'boy', 'who', 'attempted', 'steal', 'car', 'Walt', 'Thao', ""n't"", 'kids', 'Hmong', 'gang', 'boy', 'actually', 'chance', 'do', 'something', 'life', 'Walt', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'happen', 'as', 'long', 'Hmong', 'gang', 'terrorize', 'Thao', 'family.Clint', 'Eastwood', 'arguably', 'one', 'best', 'directors', 'business', 'people', 'have', 'complained', 'acting', 'Hmong', 'cast', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'are', ""n't"", 'professional', 'actors', 'okay', 'Instead', 'are', 'simply', 'playing', 'lines', 'almost', 'seem', 'improvisational', 'not', 'script', 'film', 'well', 'was', 'especially', 'impressed', 'young', 'Ahney', 'Her', 'Sue', 'felt', 'wonderfully', 'created', 'bridge', 'Sue', 'Walt', 'tough', 'yet', 'kind', 'sensitive', 'pretty', 'good', 'balance', 'achieve', 'first-time', 'actress.Walt', 'Kowalski', 'carrying', 'heavy', 'burden', 'guilt', 'priest', 'help', 'Walt', 'Walt', 'know', 'nothing', 'life', 'death', 'kid', 'priest', 'Walt', 'correct', 'priest', 'never', 'been', 'war', 'ever', 'been', 'asked', 'take', 'life', 'was', 'job', 'learn', 'hate', 'group', 'people', 'help', 'perform', 'job', 'poison', 'anger', 'guilt', 'eating', 'Walt', 'up', 'what', 'Walt', 'contrary', 'evident', 'Walt', 'Sue', 'Thao', 'were', 'own', 'kids', 'something', 'never', 'ever', 'have', 'be', 'part', 'of.Gran', 'Torino', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'last', 'acting', 'job', 'boy', 'end', 'illustrious', 'career', 'incredible', 'film', 'power', 'redemption', 'finding', 'way', 'excising', 'demons', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'how', 'holding', 'guilt', 'eats', 'up', 'cancer', 'scenes', 'are', 'difficult', 'watch', 'strangely', 'enough', 'get', 'used', 'Walt', 'constant', 'racial', 'slurs', 'think', 'reason', 'most', 'audience', 'who', 'Walt', 'Kowalski', ""n't"", 'really', 'mean', 'simply', ""n't"", 'know', 'other', 'way', 'communicate.Gran', 'Torino', 'may', 'not', 'seem', 'masterpiece', 'really', 'close', 'Eastwood', 'final', 'curtain', 'call', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'lot', 'power', 'message', 'many', 'may', 'well', 'view', 'masterpiece']",Gran Torino
1209175,A2C5VLIJMDPWHI,B001KVZ6ES,"Shamontiel L. Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[4, 6]","Walt Kowalski (played by Clint Eastwood) is a man's man. Korean war veteran. Cold beer. Car lover, especially of his 1972 Gran Torino. And of course, he has man's best friend--a dog. When his wife died, he set off to be by himself, not that he had much of a choice considering his family is the most selfish, egotistical, and self-righteous crew I've ever seen onscreen. Remember that saying ""With a family like this, who needs enemies?"" His granddaughter text-messaging at her grandmother's funeral set the scene for the kinfolk he had to tolerate. ""Gran Torino"" made me wonder what was worse--Kowalski fighting in the Korean War or a family reunion with these folks.Kowalski has medical issues, but after not going to a doctor in three years, he still has zero interest in seeing one, especially after finding out that his new doctor is Asian. ""Gran Torino"" has more politically incorrect comments than the film ""Crash,"" but instead of being aggravated at all the slurs Kowalski's character threw out, I found myself laughing at him. He was cute. A crabby old man who had an opinion about everything, and he reminded me a lot of Archie Bunker from ""All in the Family.""His only problem is his heart is bigger than his wrath, and he can't fight it. When a young, Asian boy named Thao Vang Lor (played by Bee Vang) is picked on by an Asian gang, including one of his cousins, who feels it's mandatory that he join their gang after rescuing Thao from a Latino gang, Kowalski isn't having that drama on his front lawn. Thao was forced into trying to steal Kowalski's Gran Torino, and things went awry. Gang violence, stealing cars, and unwanted visitors interrupt Kowalski's beer and dog confession time. So he does what any veteran would do. He proves that he is not afraid to deal with some punk kids who think they're tough.Unfortunately for Kowalski, after defending Thao and his sister, Sue Lohr (played by Ahney Her), the rest of the neighborhood wants to thank him, and he has zero interest in associating with Asians or any other minority group. And from the sounds of the conversations with his barber, he doesn't even like white people too much either. An equal opportunity hater, if you will.The Lohr family make Thao give Kowalski a week of free manual service to apologize for trying to steal his car, and an awkward but amusing friendship is created. Regardless of that bond though, both Thao and Kowalski know the gang has not forgotten that they've lost a potential new member and one less car.The dialogue was realistic, but it'll definitely stun viewers with sensitive ears. Clint Eastwood blew me away in this film, and as usual, his character in this movie made me wonder was he playing someone he knew or a piece of himself, especially when he growled like a dog. You can't learn that in acting class. That's natural. Although Ahney Her was a bit too stiff for me, Bee Vang is definitely holding up his end as the troubled teenager.

Sure, he is the cousin of one of them, but he is also a wussy young kid. Why on earth would they want him hanging around? Heck, even if wanted to get in the car, it was already full. Whose lap did they want him to sit on?Then no matter what Walt/Eastwood does to the local thugs, from mouthing off to pulling guns on them to beating them up, the thugs never come after HIM.And when Walt gets to the porch with his gun in time to witness the drive-by shooting, he not only does not shoot at the bad guys, but he does not identify them to the police. Likewise, the girl who gets beat up does not identify them. Yes, it's been established that Walt doesn't believe in letting the cops handle trouble for him, but then ultimately, [SPOILER:] he leaves the fate of the gang in the hands of the police and the legal system instead of taking care of them himself. With any kind of lawyer, the thugs will not spend a day in jail. Walt was on their property, making threats, and as all the witnesses (who are suddenly willing to talk to the police) will testify, he made a fast motion as if going for a gun.

He is a widower, lonely, seeks refuge in his Gran Torino sports car and practical domestic tasks. He oozes growling, simmering fury at the invasion of his neighbourhood by Asian families 'Gooks, eggrolls, Charlie Chans'.The plot is a sort of grand redemption, road to calvary message as Walt finds himself unwillingly ensnared in the lives of the Korean youngsters next door to him, in particular Thao, a young man who initially tries to steal his car but emerges as a vulnerable youth in need of work and a father figure which Walt provides in his brusque, no-nonsense way (including a great scene where he educates the young Korean in savage, ball busting banter with his local Argentinian barber).As the tension develops, Walt, with his finger always metaphorically if not literally on the trigger of one of the guns he keeps in his bedroom, takes on a local gang of Asians with a much nastier tone than the ones in his immediate neighbourhood. He becomes a sort of white man protector figure, a chiselled, classical, superannuated hero who uses his old fashioned virtues to one last effect to save the new immigrant influx. The result is powerful, if a little simplistic, with bombast and symbolism overwhelming much subtlety.This film is noteworthy for being, supposedly, Eastwood's last screen role.

This is a classic, old-fashioned movie with a broad appeal. Eastwood plays a familiar role as a curmudgeonly Korean War vet, Walt, whose wife has just died. He is estranged from his sons and their families who feel they can never do anything right. Walt lives in a neighborhood that has declined in value and is beset by Hmong and Latino gangs.Walt is a straightforward man who is also glaringly racist. He is haunted by memories of his brutal years as a soldier and ruled by his warrior code. When his neighbors are attacked by a gang attempting to recruit their teenage son by force, Walt emerges from his home with a rifle to expel his neighbors and the hoodlums from his lawn. The next day he find his porch filled with food, flowers and other gifts from his Hmong neighbors who view him as a hero for fighting off the gang. At first Walt rejects these attentions but with the help of a sharp and spunky Hmong-American girl, Sue, he begins to open up and appreciate his community. He takes a neighbor boy under his wing, teaching him what he knows about being a man. Ultimately Walt has to figure out how to combat the Hmong gangs which continue to threaten his new friends.Eastwood has delivered a movie full of heart and hope. It provides a view into Hmong culture, one that most Americans have little or no exposure to. The protectiveness that this character develops for his neighbors is touching. Eastwood delivers his usual top-notch performance as actor, portraying a battle-scarred warrior who still can take care of business despite his stoop and floppy seated old-man pants. His direction is very good but a few scenes are too long and some not long enough. The fault lies with the script which has many excellent elements but some underdeveloped sections, as well as some stock characters such as his weak and greedy sons and their snotty children. The script could have benefitted from a little more tweaking to the psychological development of the story. The Hmong actors stick closely to an accurate portrayal of their cultural psychology and therefore lack American fluidity. To my mind this lends verisimilitude to the film creating an appealing portrayal of cultural encounters and clashes.Gran Torino is a solid, old-fashioned movie with a non-preachy redemption motif that delivers laughs, satisfaction and tears as well as portraying the darker realms of humanity's propensity for brutality.",4,Dirty Harry gets old in the 'hood!,1230940800,"01 3, 2009",2009,2500,"['Gran', 'Torino', 'Eastwood', 'first', 'film', 'star', 'director', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'classic', 'old-fashioned', 'movie', 'broad', 'appeal', 'Eastwood', 'familiar', 'role', 'curmudgeonly', 'Korean', 'War', 'vet', 'Walt', 'wife', 'just', 'died', 'estranged', 'sons', 'families', 'who', 'feel', 'can', 'never', 'do', 'anything', 'right', 'Walt', 'neighborhood', 'declined', 'value', 'beset', 'Hmong', 'Latino', 'gangs.Walt', 'straightforward', 'man', 'who', 'also', 'glaringly', 'racist', 'haunted', 'memories', 'brutal', 'years', 'soldier', 'ruled', 'warrior', 'code', 'When', 'neighbors', 'are', 'attacked', 'gang', 'attempting', 'recruit', 'teenage', 'son', 'force', 'Walt', 'home', 'rifle', 'expel', 'neighbors', 'hoodlums', 'lawn', 'next', 'day', 'find', 'porch', 'filled', 'food', 'flowers', 'other', 'gifts', 'Hmong', 'neighbors', 'who', 'view', 'hero', 'fighting', 'off', 'gang', 'first', 'Walt', 'attentions', 'help', 'sharp', 'spunky', 'Hmong-American', 'girl', 'Sue', 'open', 'up', 'appreciate', 'community', 'neighbor', 'boy', 'wing', 'teaching', 'what', 'being', 'man', 'Ultimately', 'Walt', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'combat', 'Hmong', 'gangs', 'continue', 'threaten', 'new', 'friends.Eastwood', 'delivered', 'movie', 'full', 'heart', 'hope', 'view', 'Hmong', 'culture', 'one', 'most', 'Americans', 'have', 'little', 'exposure', 'protectiveness', 'character', 'neighbors', 'touching', 'Eastwood', 'delivers', 'usual', 'top-notch', 'performance', 'actor', 'portraying', 'battle-scarred', 'warrior', 'who', 'still', 'can', 'take', 'care', 'business', 'stoop', 'floppy', 'seated', 'old-man', 'pants', 'direction', 'very', 'good', 'few', 'scenes', 'are', 'too', 'long', 'not', 'long', 'enough', 'fault', 'script', 'many', 'excellent', 'elements', 'underdeveloped', 'sections', 'as', 'well', 'stock', 'characters', 'such', 'weak', 'greedy', 'sons', 'snotty', 'children', 'script', 'could', 'have', 'benefitted', 'little', 'more', 'tweaking', 'psychological', 'development', 'story', 'Hmong', 'actors', 'stick', 'closely', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'cultural', 'psychology', 'therefore', 'lack', 'American', 'fluidity', 'mind', 'verisimilitude', 'film', 'creating', 'appealing', 'portrayal', 'cultural', 'encounters', 'clashes.Gran', 'Torino', 'solid', 'old-fashioned', 'movie', 'non-preachy', 'redemption', 'motif', 'delivers', 'laughs', 'satisfaction', 'tears', 'as', 'well', 'portraying', 'darker', 'realms', 'humanity', 'propensity', 'brutality']",Gran Torino

Directed by, produced by and starring Clint Eastwood, this film has a feeling of gravitas and meaning from the word go. This follows Walt Kowalski, who is a Korean war veteran, and how has he seen the neighbourhood around him change over the years and how he has seen a rise in violence and intimidation. It also looks at how he faces his own prejudices about his Hmong neighbours and strikes a relationship with the family next door. It is touching to see Walt develop from the archetype grumpy old man, to seeing someone with a softer side and with a great deal of compassion for those who are in a worse situation than himself. Clint plays Walt gruff and old school from the outset and you often laugh at his up front honesty, especially when confronted with a do-good catholic priest, but he isn't a one trick pony and manages to show his considerable acting (and directing) skills throughout. This may be Clint's swansong film, but considering the calibre of films he is making at the moment it would be a great shame if that was so. This has a powerful ending that will resonate long after the credits have rolled and will have you coming back to it in your mind at odd times in the days after you watch the film.

Nemeth,"[13, 15]","This film has been unjustly neglected by the various film societies which deliver awards for excellence, with the exception of the National Board of Review. Its relatively unheralded excellence lies not solely in its lead performance and direction, though Clint Eastwood is outstanding on both counts. What is most wonderful is the remarkably witty and insightful script he's been given to work with, a script by a first-time screenwriter. Its thesis, subversive for our age of political correctness and speech codes to protect shrinking violets from being ""offended,"" is that, when push come to shove, actions, as the old proverb has always told us, speak louder than mere words. Yet we live in an age obsessed by words, one frequently oblivious to deeds, an age in which Clarence Thomas, for instance, was pilloried for making a merely verbal pass without punitive consequences, while a presumably verbally decorous President was given a free pass for flagrantly outrageous deeds with an intern. Go figure! This film's script is daring enough to get the relation between merely ""offensive"" words and surprisingly noble deeds back into proper proportion. As a corrective to a contemporary imbalance in vision, it deserves far more praise than it's so far received.",5,"""Deeds, Not Words""",1234742400,"02 16, 2009",2009,1265,"['film', 'been', 'unjustly', 'neglected', 'various', 'film', 'societies', 'deliver', 'awards', 'excellence', 'exception', 'National', 'Board', 'Review', 'relatively', 'unheralded', 'excellence', 'not', 'solely', 'lead', 'performance', 'direction', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'outstanding', 'counts', 'What', 'most', 'wonderful', 'remarkably', 'witty', 'insightful', 'script', 'been', 'given', 'work', 'script', 'first-time', 'screenwriter', 'thesis', 'subversive', 'age', 'political', 'correctness', 'speech', 'codes', 'protect', 'shrinking', 'violets', 'being', 'offended', 'when', 'push', 'come', 'shove', 'actions', 'old', 'proverb', 'always', 'told', 'louder', 'mere', 'words', 'live', 'age', 'obsessed', 'words', 'one', 'frequently', 'oblivious', 'deeds', 'age', 'Clarence', 'Thomas', 'instance', 'was', 'pilloried', 'making', 'merely', 'verbal', 'pass', 'punitive', 'consequences', 'presumably', 'verbally', 'decorous', 'President', 'was', 'given', 'free', 'pass', 'flagrantly', 'outrageous', 'deeds', 'intern', 'Go', 'figure', 'film', 'script', 'daring', 'enough', 'get', 'relation', 'merely', 'offensive', 'words', 'surprisingly', 'noble', 'deeds', 'back', 'proper', 'proportion', 'corrective', 'contemporary', 'imbalance', 'vision', 'far', 'more', 'praise', 'so', 'far', 'received']",Gran Torino

1209193,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B001KVZ6ES,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[3, 3]","Clint Eastwood pulls double duty as director and actor here, starring as Walt Kowalski, a mean, cranky old racist who has a change of heart in ""Gran Torino"".  The journey Walt takes is just one of several making up the movie though.It starts with the funeral of Walt's beloved wife, who we never see but gather was somewhat of a kinder soul than Walt, and probably a positive influence as far as keeping his nastier character traits at bay.  In the days following the funeral we see Walt as alone and bitter, estranged from the rest of his family and seemingly unable to make emotional connections.  One of the things making him so bitter is that his neighborhood is becoming increasingly Asian in character.  North America is changing, and places that were once almost exclusively white are now more multi-racial or in some case dominated by one particular ethnic group.  This neighborhood has an increasing number of Hmong (a Southeast Asian ethnic group), and it's safe to say that Walt hasn't been overjoyed to see their numbers increasing over the years.  At the start of the movie, he's a racist, not just 'old and set in his ways', not just 'narrow-minded', but outright racist.  The fact that the movie doesn't try to sugarcoat it makes the character's transformation much more powerful.There are two main interpersonal 'pulls' in the movie - one is Walt's being pulled against his will into the fabric of the neighborhood, the other is a Hmong kid of around 15 (I estimate), Thao (Bee Vang) - Walt's next door neighbor - being pulled against his will into a Hmong-dominated street gang.  He's cousin to one of the heads of the gang, and therefore, as the gang expands further and further from their traditional stomping grounds and into the suburbs, Thao gets invited to join.  In classic gang style, it's an offer he can't refuse.  So little by little he's getting sucked into this lifestyle that he very much wants to avoid, but appears powerless to.  His initiation feat into the gang is to steal his neighbor Walt's classic Gran Torino car.  When he's caught in the act and the other members flee, his family decides his punishment is to 'help out' Walt with yard work, household chores, etc. for the next little while, as atonement.  Walt isn't interested and refuses the deal, but Thao is pushed to try and make ammends anyway.  Not long after, an incident in the neighborhood involving the gang occurs, and Walt becomes the neighborhood hero by running a couple of gang members off.  To Walt's horror, this seems to spur the Hmong community in the neighborhood to 'adopt' him, arriving with gifts and baskets and food, always greeting him warmly, seemingly oblivious to the fact that Walt doesn't like them very much.  Of course, despite his hostility towards Asians, he's never really known one outside of his experiences in the Korean War, where they were on opposite sides (he seems to have plenty of recollections of Koreans as the enemy, but few of the South Koreans as his side's allies).  As he's unwillingly drawn into the community, his feelings toward his Hmong neighbors slowly begin to change...This may sound cliched or contrived, but absolutely nothing in the movie comes off that way.  Every characterization and interaction - good or bad - feels very genuine.  During this time we see Walt trying and failing to re-establish some kind of connection with his biological family; we also see him being very shocked with himself that he's becoming so close to his 'new' family, particularly Thao and his older sister Sue (Ahney Her), to both of whom he seems to be filling some kind of uncle of even fatherly role.  Meanwhile though, the other pull is still going - the gang's determination to recruit Thao, seemingly motivated primarily by the fact that they're offended by the idea of anyone turning them down.  Thao is increasingly determined not to go that way, but that just seems to make the gang more insistent.  Gran Torino gives a really good picture of the hard spot someone like Thao is in when he's targeted for recruitment like this by a gang that might do anything at all if he doesn't go along with them.  It's a predicament his family sees, and that Walt comes to recognize as well.The movie becomes extremely intense in its end stages, building up to a tremendously powerful finale.  What's more unexpected is all the humor and, for lack of a better word, 'warmth' that starts coming in about a third of the way through.  These elements don't clash with the tension, but provide a counterpoint.  And as we see in the movie, things can turn from very 'happy' to very, very grim on a dime.An ability to juggle seemingly disparate tones, and universally excellent performances, help make Gran Torino a great movie on all levels.  For a skillful blend of drama, tenderness and vicious suspense, you can't go better than this one.",5,Powerful Drama/Thriller With Outstanding Performances And Characterization,1272931200,"05 4, 2010",2010,4870,"['Clint', 'Eastwood', 'pulls', 'double', 'duty', 'director', 'actor', 'here', 'starring', 'Walt', 'Kowalski', 'mean', 'cranky', 'old', 'racist', 'who', 'change', 'heart', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'journey', 'Walt', 'just', 'one', 'several', 'making', 'up', 'movie', 'though.It', 'funeral', 'Walt', 'beloved', 'wife', 'who', 'never', 'see', 'gather', 'was', 'somewhat', 'kinder', 'soul', 'Walt', 'probably', 'positive', 'influence', 'as', 'far', 'keeping', 'nastier', 'character', 'traits', 'bay', 'days', 'following', 'funeral', 'see', 'Walt', 'alone', 'bitter', 'estranged', 'rest', 'family', 'seemingly', 'unable', 'make', 'emotional', 'connections', 'One', 'things', 'making', 'so', 'bitter', 'neighborhood', 'becoming', 'increasingly', 'Asian', 'character', 'North', 'America', 'changing', 'places', 'were', 'once', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'white', 'are', 'now', 'more', 'multi-racial', 'case', 'dominated', 'one', 'particular', 'ethnic', 'group', 'neighborhood', 'increasing', 'number', 'Hmong', 'Southeast', 'Asian', 'ethnic', 'group', 'safe', 'say', 'Walt', ""n't"", 'been', 'overjoyed', 'see', 'numbers', 'increasing', 'years', 'start', 'movie', 'racist', 'not', 'just', ""'old"", 'set', 'ways', 'not', 'just', ""'narrow-minded"", 'outright', 'racist', 'fact', 'movie', ""n't"", 'try', 'sugarcoat', 'character', 'transformation', 'much', 'more', 'powerful.There', 'are', 'two', 'main', 'interpersonal', ""'pulls"", 'movie', 'one', 'Walt', 'being', 'pulled', 'will', 'fabric', 'neighborhood', 'other', 'Hmong', 'kid', '15', 'estimate', 'Thao', 'Bee', 'Vang', 'Walt', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'being', 'pulled', 'will', 'Hmong-dominated', 'street', 'gang', 'cousin', 'one', 'heads', 'gang', 'therefore', 'gang', 'further', 'further', 'traditional', 'stomping', 'grounds', 'suburbs', 'Thao', 'invited', 'join', 'classic', 'gang', 'style', 'offer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'refuse', 'So', 'little', 'little', 'getting', 'sucked', 'lifestyle', 'very', 'much', 'avoid', 'powerless', 'initiation', 'feat', 'gang', 'steal', 'neighbor', 'Walt', 'classic', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'car', 'When', 'caught', 'act', 'other', 'members', 'flee', 'family', 'punishment', ""'help"", 'out', 'Walt', 'yard', 'work', 'household', 'chores', 'etc', 'next', 'little', 'while', 'atonement', 'Walt', ""n't"", 'interested', 'deal', 'Thao', 'pushed', 'try', 'make', 'ammends', 'anyway', 'Not', 'long', 'incident', 'neighborhood', 'involving', 'gang', 'Walt', 'neighborhood', 'hero', 'running', 'couple', 'gang', 'members', 'off', 'Walt', 'horror', 'spur', 'Hmong', 'community', 'neighborhood', ""'adopt"", 'arriving', 'gifts', 'baskets', 'food', 'always', 'greeting', 'warmly', 'seemingly', 'oblivious', 'fact', 'Walt', ""n't"", 'like', 'very', 'much', 'course', 'hostility', 'towards', 'Asians', 'never', 'really', 'known', 'one', 'outside', 'experiences', 'Korean', 'War', 'where', 'were', 'opposite', 'sides', 'have', 'plenty', 'recollections', 'Koreans', 'enemy', 'few', 'South', 'Koreans', 'side', 'allies', 'unwillingly', 'drawn', 'community', 'feelings', 'Hmong', 'neighbors', 'slowly', 'begin', 'change', 'may', 'sound', 'cliched', 'contrived', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'movie', 'off', 'way', 'characterization', 'interaction', 'good', 'bad', 'feels', 'very', 'genuine', 'time', 'see', 'Walt', 'trying', 'failing', 're-establish', 'kind', 'connection', 'biological', 'family', 'also', 'see', 'being', 'very', 'shocked', 'becoming', 'so', 'close', ""'new"", 'family', 'particularly', 'Thao', 'older', 'sister', 'Sue', 'Ahney', 'Her', 'whom', 'be', 'filling', 'kind', 'uncle', 'even', 'fatherly', 'role', 'Meanwhile', 'other', 'pull', 'still', 'going', 'gang', 'determination', 'recruit', 'Thao', 'seemingly', 'motivated', 'primarily', 'fact', ""'re"", 'offended', 'idea', 'anyone', 'turning', 'down', 'Thao', 'increasingly', 'determined', 'not', 'go', 'way', 'just', 'make', 'gang', 'more', 'insistent', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'really', 'good', 'picture', 'hard', 'spot', 'someone', 'Thao', 'when', 'targeted', 'recruitment', 'gang', 'might', 'do', 'anything', ""n't"", 'go', 'along', 'predicament', 'family', 'sees', 'Walt', 'recognize', 'well.The', 'movie', 'extremely', 'intense', 'end', 'stages', 'building', 'up', 'tremendously', 'powerful', 'finale', 'What', 'more', 'unexpected', 'humor', 'lack', 'better', 'word', 'coming', 'third', 'way', 'elements', 'do', ""n't"", 'clash', 'tension', 'provide', 'counterpoint', 'see', 'movie', 'things', 'can', 'turn', 'very', ""'happy"", 'very', 'very', 'grim', 'dime.An', 'ability', 'juggle', 'seemingly', 'disparate', 'tones', 'universally', 'excellent', 'performances', 'help', 'make', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'great', 'movie', 'levels', 'skillful', 'blend', 'drama', 'tenderness', 'vicious', 'suspense', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'better', 'one']",Gran Torino
1209194,A3LXKO2S6G2DBI,B001KVZ6ES,"Stephen Kaczmarek ""Educator, Writer, Consultant""","[1, 4]","With both Asian and Polish ancestry and having grown up only an hour or so away from Detroit, I found watching ""Gran Torino"" a surreal experience.  Having at one time or another been called every vile term his Walt Kowalski levels with complete ease at his Hmong neighbors, I know the film ain't lying about the generally overlooked and often discounted racism against Asians in the U.S., but at the same time, I've never met anyone, let alone anyone Polish, with the unceasing vitriol that defines Walt's very existence.  In this, he falls into that narrow range of choices Hollywood makes for ethnic groups; if Italians must be gangsters and pizza makers or the Irish cops and bartenders, then Walt has to be the stereotypical racist, drunken, blue-collar Polack.  (He has plenty of company -- for starters, think Marlon Brando in ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" and Mickey Rourke in ""Year of the Dragon."")  Oh, make no mistake, factory workers, including ones in my own family, could put away the beer, but Walt might well put two or three of these red-blooded guys under the table, even if I can't for the life of me remember any of them ever even contemplating reaching for a Pabst Blue Ribbon.But all this is understandable because despite its illusion of grit, ""Gran Torino"" exists in a gauzy fantasy space that allows suburban moviegoers to confront the real ugliness of bigotry, even their own, from a safe, artificial distance, like staring down that lion at the zoo that in the wild would be feasting on their bones.  Once again, Walt falls into another familiar Hollywood trope: the flawed white guy who must overcome his prejudices to help beleaguered minorities who can't help themselves.  Oh, and he's haunted by a war with Asians.  And his family is a bunch of jerks.  And he's dying, too.  If it sounds like I'm being too hard on ""Gran Torino,"" a film that's wowed both critics and audiences, perhaps I am, but it's mostly because I truly like and expect more of Clint Eastwood, even moreso now that he's deservedly come into his own as a filmmaker with fare like ""Letters from Iwo Jima.""  Even here, he gives a performance that rises above the predictable story and hokey setups that too often mar the intent of ""Gran Torino"" to be taken seriously as a drama rather than a melodrama, and more importantly, a meaningful statement on racial harmony.  But I'm also struck by the nagging feeling that if it wasn't for the presence of Eastwood, playing what in many ways is a geriatric version of Dirty Harry, the same people lauding the film might not be shrugging at its mediocrity (and, no, I'm not referring to the sincere but sometimes uneven performances of his Hmong co-stars).  What's left are a lot of funny lines, mostly because of the brazenness of Walt's racism, a few touching moments between Walt and Sue and Tao, the two kids he will grow closest to, and an ending that's a ""gotcha"" you'll see coming from a mile away.Still -- and this is part of the surreality -- seeing an 80-year-old Eastwood sticking an M-1 rifle in a punk's face and snarling ""Get off my lawn"" is almost worth the price of admission alone.  It, too, is a cliche, but one of the few that the writers manage to cleverly turn on its head.",4,"Dramatically Weak, But Eastwood Rises Above the Flaws",1248998400,"07 31, 2009",2009,3230,"['Asian', 'Polish', 'ancestry', 'having', 'grown', 'up', 'only', 'hour', 'so', 'away', 'Detroit', 'found', 'watching', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'surreal', 'experience', 'Having', 'one', 'time', 'been', 'called', 'vile', 'term', 'Walt', 'Kowalski', 'levels', 'complete', 'ease', 'Hmong', 'neighbors', 'know', 'film', 'ai', ""n't"", 'lying', 'generally', 'overlooked', 'often', 'discounted', 'racism', 'Asians', 'U.S.', 'same', 'time', ""'ve"", 'never', 'met', 'anyone', 'let', 'alone', 'anyone', 'Polish', 'unceasing', 'vitriol', 'Walt', 'very', 'existence', 'narrow', 'range', 'choices', 'Hollywood', 'ethnic', 'groups', 'Italians', 'must', 'be', 'gangsters', 'pizza', 'makers', 'Irish', 'cops', 'bartenders', 'then', 'Walt', 'be', 'stereotypical', 'racist', 'drunken', 'blue-collar', 'Polack', 'plenty', 'company', 'starters', 'think', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'A', 'Streetcar', 'Named', 'Desire', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'Year', 'Dragon', 'Oh', 'make', 'mistake', 'factory', 'workers', 'including', 'ones', 'own', 'family', 'could', 'put', 'away', 'beer', 'Walt', 'might', 'well', 'put', 'two', 'three', 'red-blooded', 'guys', 'table', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'life', 'remember', 'ever', 'even', 'contemplating', 'reaching', 'Pabst', 'Blue', 'Ribbon.But', 'understandable', 'illusion', 'grit', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'gauzy', 'fantasy', 'space', 'suburban', 'moviegoers', 'confront', 'real', 'ugliness', 'bigotry', 'even', 'own', 'safe', 'artificial', 'distance', 'staring', 'down', 'lion', 'zoo', 'wild', 'would', 'be', 'feasting', 'bones', 'Once', 'again', 'Walt', 'familiar', 'Hollywood', 'trope', 'flawed', 'white', 'guy', 'who', 'must', 'overcome', 'prejudices', 'help', 'beleaguered', 'minorities', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'Oh', 'haunted', 'war', 'Asians', 'family', 'bunch', 'jerks', 'dying', 'too', ""'m"", 'being', 'too', 'hard', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'film', 'wowed', 'critics', 'audiences', 'perhaps', 'am', 'mostly', 'truly', 'expect', 'more', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'even', 'moreso', 'now', 'deservedly', 'come', 'own', 'filmmaker', 'fare', 'Letters', 'Iwo', 'Jima', 'Even', 'here', 'performance', 'predictable', 'story', 'hokey', 'setups', 'too', 'often', 'intent', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'drama', 'rather', 'melodrama', 'more', 'importantly', 'meaningful', 'statement', 'racial', 'harmony', ""'m"", 'also', 'struck', 'nagging', 'feeling', 'was', ""n't"", 'presence', 'Eastwood', 'playing', 'what', 'many', 'ways', 'geriatric', 'version', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'same', 'people', 'lauding', 'film', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'shrugging', 'mediocrity', ""'m"", 'not', 'referring', 'sincere', 'sometimes', 'uneven', 'performances', 'Hmong', 'co-stars', 'What', 'left', 'are', 'lot', 'funny', 'lines', 'mostly', 'brazenness', 'Walt', 'racism', 'few', 'touching', 'moments', 'Walt', 'Sue', 'Tao', 'two', 'kids', 'will', 'grow', 'closest', 'ending', 'gotcha', ""'ll"", 'see', 'coming', 'mile', 'away.Still', 'part', 'surreality', 'seeing', '80-year-old', 'Eastwood', 'sticking', 'M-1', 'rifle', 'punk', 'face', 'snarling', 'Get', 'lawn', 'almost', 'worth', 'price', 'admission', 'alone', 'too', 'cliche', 'one', 'few', 'writers', 'manage', 'cleverly', 'turn', 'head']",Gran Torino

The gang does something to the older sister and Walt vows revenge declaring that ""They won't stand a chance [against me].""(Hmong or Mong Americans are residents of the U.S. who are of ethnic Hmong decent.  Indigenous Hmong are specifically from the mountainous regions of Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, and Burma. The Hmong are also one of the subgroups of Miao ethnicity in Southern China.)Despite the movie's deceptive simplicity, it evolves into something complex, powerful, and even tender.For those who like lots of mindless action in their movies, this movie can become tedious.  However, those with patience will be rewarded by this movie's end.This movie marked Eastwood's return to leading actor status after four years (his previous leading role was in the movie ""Million Dollar Baby"").  The then 78-year old delivers a superb performance in what he has said is his final film as an actor.Eastwood can make ""Get off my lawn"" (while aiming an M-1 rifle) sound as menacing as Dirty Harry's ""Make my day.""  When he says, ""I'll blow a hole in your face and [then] sleep like a baby,"" he sounds as if he means it.Beware that despite some moments, Walt's toughness is more verbal than physical.This movie features a large Hmong American cast.  Even though the actor who played Thao (Bee Vang) and the actress who play his older sister (Ahney Her) had no previous acting experience, they hold their own with Eastwood and give convincing performances.(Note that Eastwood's young son, Scott, also has a small part in this movie.)The song in the movie titled ""Gran Torino"" was nominated for the Golden Globe Awards for Best Original Song.  This music was a collaborative effort of four people that included Clint Eastwood (who sings briefly during the end credits) and his oldest son, Kyle Eastwood, who wrote the music.This movie was recognized as one of the ten best films of 2008.  Eastwood's performance gained recognition winning ""Best Actor"" from the National Board of Review.  As well, this movie has grossed almost ten times more than what it cost to make.Finally, the DVD (the one released in 2009) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has two extras.In conclusion, this is simply a remarkable movie.  I leave you with what Walt says to a young priest, the priest who presided over his wife's funeral:""I think you're an overeducated 27-year-old virgin who likes to hold the hands of superstitious old ladies and promise them everlasting life.""(2008;  1 hr, 55 min;  wide screen, 29 scenes;  rated 'R')&lt;&lt;Stephen Pletko, London, Ontario, Canada>>XXXXX",5,An older Dirty Harry is back (well almost),1265414400,"02 6, 2010",2010,3264,"['XXXXX', 'Mexican', 'Jew', 'coloured', 'guy', 'walk', 'bar', 'bartender', 'up', '[', 'common', 'vulgar', 'word', 'here', 'joke', 'said', 'movie', 'main', 'character', 'Walt', 'Kowalski', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'produced', 'movie', 'story', 'Walt', 'recently', 'widowed', 'Korean', 'War', 'veteran', 'who', 'alienated', 'family', 'angry', 'world', 'Walt', 'young', 'Hmong', 'American', 'neighbour', 'Thao', 'Toad', 'Walt', 'steal', 'Walt', 'prized', '1972', 'Ford', 'Torino', 'more', 'specifically', 'Ford', 'Grand', 'Torino', 'Sport', 'Sports', 'Roof', 'dare', 'cousin', 'initiation', 'gang', 'Walt', 'close', 'relationship', 'boy', 'older', 'sister', 'gang', 'something', 'older', 'sister', 'Walt', 'revenge', 'declaring', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stand', 'chance', '[', ']', 'Hmong', 'Mong', 'Americans', 'are', 'residents', 'U.S.', 'who', 'are', 'ethnic', 'Hmong', 'decent', 'Indigenous', 'Hmong', 'are', 'specifically', 'mountainous', 'regions', 'Vietnam', 'Laos', 'Thailand', 'Burma', 'Hmong', 'are', 'also', 'one', 'subgroups', 'Miao', 'ethnicity', 'Southern', 'China', 'movie', 'deceptive', 'simplicity', 'something', 'complex', 'powerful', 'even', 'tender.For', 'who', 'like', 'lots', 'mindless', 'action', 'movies', 'movie', 'can', 'become', 'tedious', 'However', 'patience', 'will', 'be', 'rewarded', 'movie', 'end.This', 'movie', 'marked', 'Eastwood', 'return', 'leading', 'actor', 'status', 'four', 'years', 'previous', 'leading', 'role', 'was', 'movie', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'then', '78-year', 'old', 'delivers', 'superb', 'performance', 'what', 'said', 'final', 'film', 'actor.Eastwood', 'can', 'make', 'Get', 'lawn', 'aiming', 'M-1', 'rifle', 'sound', 'as', 'menacing', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'Make', 'day', 'When', ""'ll"", 'blow', 'hole', 'face', '[', 'then', ']', 'sleep', 'baby', 'it.Beware', 'moments', 'Walt', 'toughness', 'more', 'verbal', 'physical.This', 'movie', 'large', 'Hmong', 'American', 'cast', 'Even', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Thao', 'Bee', 'Vang', 'actress', 'who', 'play', 'older', 'sister', 'Ahney', 'Her', 'had', 'previous', 'acting', 'experience', 'hold', 'own', 'Eastwood', 'give', 'convincing', 'performances', 'Note', 'Eastwood', 'young', 'son', 'Scott', 'also', 'small', 'part', 'movie', 'song', 'movie', 'titled', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'was', 'nominated', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Awards', 'Best', 'Original', 'Song', 'music', 'was', 'collaborative', 'effort', 'four', 'people', 'included', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'who', 'sings', 'briefly', 'end', 'credits', 'oldest', 'son', 'Kyle', 'Eastwood', 'who', 'wrote', 'music.This', 'movie', 'was', 'recognized', 'one', 'ten', 'best', 'films', '2008', 'Eastwood', 'performance', 'gained', 'recognition', 'winning', 'Best', 'Actor', 'National', 'Board', 'Review', 'As', 'well', 'movie', 'grossed', 'almost', 'ten', 'times', 'more', 'what', 'cost', 'make.Finally', 'DVD', 'one', 'released', '2009', 'perfect', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'two', 'extras.In', 'conclusion', 'simply', 'remarkable', 'movie', 'leave', 'what', 'Walt', 'young', 'priest', 'priest', 'who', 'presided', 'wife', 'funeral', 'think', ""'re"", 'overeducated', '27-year-old', 'virgin', 'who', 'hold', 'hands', 'superstitious', 'old', 'ladies', 'promise', 'everlasting', 'life', '2008', '1', 'hr', '55', 'min', 'wide', 'screen', '29', 'scenes', 'rated', 'R', 'lt', 'lt', 'Stephen', 'Pletko', 'London', 'Ontario', 'Canada', '>', '>', 'XXXXX']",Gran Torino

Hollywood doesn't deserve such a beautiful, touching movie.Clint's snarling, grumbling curmudgeon, Walt Kowalski, makes Dirty Harry seem warm and cuddly by comparison.  But Walt has important lessons to teach us about humanity.  That actions really do mean more than words, that, as Viktor Frankl put it, there really are only two races: the decent and the indecent.  Way too troubling a message for the Hollywood crowd.As if that weren't enough to gain it a Best Picture nod, you get the little gem of a theme song, subtly woven into the body of the film and finally emerging in full flower at its end.

1209197,A1FNES0QEBJZD1,B001KVZ6ES,Steve Douglas,"[2, 2]","I love this film and ,when seeing it in the theater, it was nothing like I expected and everything I hoped for.  The 5 stars go to an incredibly moving, dramatic and humorous film that should have won an Academy award for Best Picture, Best Directing, Best Supporting Actor and Actress, Best everything.  That said, there are plenty of reviews here already doing a book report on the plot so I will refrain from that.So lets take a look at the Blu Ray version and how it stacks up to the Standard version which I also own. The Standard DVD version was not bad to begin with.  The Blu Ray video transfer is good, not great.  There is a scene early in the film when a car pulls up and you can clearly see aliasing/stairstepping in the cars chrome grill.  Seeing this, I look for those artifacts in other areas of the video transfer but failed to find them.  As this is a dark film, somewhat  desaturated in color, the shadows retain depth and detail as a blu ray transfer should, but, then again, so did the standard def version.  The Audio is DDHD and, as this is a very dialogue driven film, there was little use for the surround speakers or sub. There was some use of the front side channels when cars were driven but that was about it.The extras were the typical commentaries, and an interesting and informative 'making of' with a good amount of discussion regarding integrating the Hmong culture and actors within the film.  This was well worth watching.  Really don't see the big deal about BD Live...does anyone really use it?  I would have rather space been used for deleted scenes, of which there were none, out takes and the like.  You were able to see some original audition clips for the parts of Sue and Thao and I would have liked more of this.I buy movies on Blu Ray for a serious upgrade of both video and audio.  While this movie gets 5 stars because it is a great film, for those who have the standard def version, I do not believe that you will see a significant difference between it and the blu ray version.All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.Thanks",5,Gran Torino on Blu Ray,1334793600,"04 19, 2012",2012,2367,"['love', 'film', 'when', 'seeing', 'theater', 'was', 'nothing', 'expected', 'everything', 'hoped', '5', 'stars', 'go', 'incredibly', 'moving', 'dramatic', 'humorous', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'Academy', 'award', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Directing', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Actress', 'Best', 'everything', 'said', 'are', 'plenty', 'reviews', 'here', 'already', 'doing', 'book', 'report', 'plot', 'will', 'refrain', 'that.So', 'lets', 'take', 'look', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'version', 'how', 'up', 'Standard', 'version', 'also', 'own', 'Standard', 'DVD', 'version', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'begin', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'video', 'transfer', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'scene', 'early', 'film', 'when', 'car', 'up', 'can', 'clearly', 'see', 'aliasing/stairstepping', 'cars', 'chrome', 'grill', 'Seeing', 'look', 'artifacts', 'other', 'areas', 'video', 'transfer', 'failed', 'find', 'dark', 'film', 'somewhat', 'desaturated', 'color', 'shadows', 'retain', 'depth', 'detail', 'blu', 'ray', 'transfer', 'should', 'then', 'again', 'so', 'did', 'standard', 'def', 'version', 'Audio', 'DDHD', 'very', 'dialogue', 'driven', 'film', 'was', 'little', 'use', 'surround', 'speakers', 'sub', 'was', 'use', 'front', 'side', 'channels', 'when', 'cars', 'were', 'driven', 'was', 'it.The', 'extras', 'were', 'typical', 'commentaries', 'interesting', 'informative', ""'making"", 'good', 'amount', 'discussion', 'regarding', 'integrating', 'Hmong', 'culture', 'actors', 'film', 'was', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'Really', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'big', 'deal', 'BD', 'Live', 'anyone', 'really', 'use', 'would', 'have', 'rather', 'space', 'been', 'used', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'were', 'none', 'like', 'were', 'able', 'see', 'original', 'audition', 'clips', 'parts', 'Sue', 'Thao', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'more', 'this.I', 'buy', 'movies', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'serious', 'upgrade', 'video', 'audio', 'movie', '5', 'stars', 'great', 'film', 'who', 'have', 'standard', 'def', 'version', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'will', 'see', 'significant', 'difference', 'blu', 'ray', 'movie', 'reviews', 'are', 'nature', 'focus', 'only', 'quality', 'transfer', 'BluRay', 'so', 'check', 'see', 'are', 'help', 'well.Hopefully', 'review', 'been', 'help', 'determining', 'purchase', 'hope', 'am', 'correct', 'path', 'review', 'transfer', 'quality', 'opposed', 'providing', 'plot', 'summaries.Thanks']",Gran Torino

I had no idea what it might be about and the cover suggested it would be an action movie. With Clint Eastwood being almost 80 years of age at the time, I couldn't see how it would work.It turns out that it isn't an action movie at all. The main themes include age, the loss of a loved one, racism, friendship, family, religion, and personal growth.Walt Kowalsky is a Korean war veteran and one of the last white people in a neighborhood mostly populated by Hmong residents. The film opens with his wife's funeral. He's suddenly friendless and alone, but for the unwanted attention of his two sons and their families, who see him as a burden and wonder what he'll leave them when he dies.The local priest (Carley) promised Walt's wife that he would keep an eye on Walt and try to get him to go to confession. His immediate neighbors annoy him; especially when their boy, Thao (Vang), tries to steal his beloved '72 Gran Torino. To complete Walt's misery, he's coughing up blood and may not have long to live.That all sounds pretty miserable, doesn't it? Despite the grim situation, Gran Torino has a great deal of (intelligent) humor. Walt doesn't pull his punches: he refers to Asians as Gooks and Blacks as Spooks. He tells the persistent priest that he's an ""over-educated 27-year-old virgin who likes to hold the hands of old ladies who are superstitious and promise them eternity."" He speaks in grunts and snarls and seems to hate every person he deals with.Walt is a complex character. His neighbors convince him to accept Thao's apology for trying to steal his car by offering the boy's labor for a week. Thao works hard and earns Walt's respect. The two actually develop a friendship of sorts and Walt also likes Thao's sister, Sue (Her). As unlikely as it may seem, from Walt's perspective, he finds that his neighbors are decent people and takes an interest in their lives. He finds that he has more in common with them than his own family.I won't give away any more details, but the story shows how people still have the capacity for change, despite advanced age and a lifetime of behaving in a certain way. The humor is frequent, with Eastwood timing his lines perfectly. At the risk of sounding dramatic, this might just be Eastwood's best acting performance. It's certainly my favorite performance from those that I have seen.",5,Get off my lawn!,1330473600,"02 29, 2012",2012,2531,"['Gran', 'Torino', '2008', 'Drama', '116', 'minutesDirected', 'Clint', 'EastwoodStarring', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Christopher', 'Carley', 'Bee', 'Vang', 'Ahney', 'HerGran', 'Torino', 'was', 'total', 'surprise', 'when', 'first', 'viewed', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'about', 'cover', 'suggested', 'would', 'be', 'action', 'movie', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'being', 'almost', '80', 'years', 'age', 'time', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'would', 'work.It', 'out', ""n't"", 'action', 'movie', 'main', 'themes', 'include', 'age', 'loss', 'loved', 'one', 'racism', 'friendship', 'family', 'religion', 'personal', 'growth.Walt', 'Kowalsky', 'Korean', 'war', 'veteran', 'one', 'last', 'white', 'people', 'neighborhood', 'mostly', 'populated', 'Hmong', 'residents', 'film', 'wife', 'funeral', 'suddenly', 'friendless', 'alone', 'unwanted', 'attention', 'two', 'sons', 'families', 'who', 'see', 'burden', 'wonder', 'what', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'when', 'dies.The', 'local', 'priest', 'Carley', 'promised', 'Walt', 'wife', 'would', 'keep', 'eye', 'Walt', 'try', 'get', 'go', 'confession', 'immediate', 'neighbors', 'annoy', 'especially', 'when', 'boy', 'Thao', 'Vang', 'steal', 'beloved', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'complete', 'Walt', 'misery', 'coughing', 'up', 'blood', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'long', 'live.That', 'sounds', 'pretty', 'miserable', ""n't"", 'grim', 'situation', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'great', 'deal', 'intelligent', 'humor', 'Walt', ""n't"", 'pull', 'punches', 'Asians', 'Gooks', 'Blacks', 'Spooks', 'persistent', 'priest', 'over-educated', '27-year-old', 'virgin', 'who', 'hold', 'hands', 'old', 'ladies', 'who', 'are', 'superstitious', 'promise', 'eternity', 'grunts', 'snarls', 'hate', 'person', 'with.Walt', 'complex', 'character', 'neighbors', 'convince', 'accept', 'Thao', 'apology', 'trying', 'steal', 'car', 'offering', 'boy', 'labor', 'week', 'Thao', 'hard', 'Walt', 'respect', 'two', 'actually', 'develop', 'friendship', 'sorts', 'Walt', 'also', 'Thao', 'sister', 'Sue', 'As', 'unlikely', 'may', 'seem', 'Walt', 'perspective', 'neighbors', 'are', 'decent', 'people', 'interest', 'lives', 'more', 'common', 'own', 'family.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'more', 'details', 'story', 'how', 'people', 'still', 'have', 'capacity', 'change', 'advanced', 'age', 'lifetime', 'behaving', 'certain', 'way', 'humor', 'frequent', 'Eastwood', 'timing', 'lines', 'perfectly', 'risk', 'sounding', 'dramatic', 'might', 'just', 'be', 'Eastwood', 'best', 'acting', 'performance', 'certainly', 'favorite', 'performance', 'have', 'seen']",Gran Torino

I wasn't going to wait for the DVD. I'm glad I didn't.The movie follows the theatrical paradigm from Aristotle's Poetics - as does every contemporary movie I have seen. You need a sympathetic character, an inciting incident, an antagonist, events that flip the action and a setting to take you out of your world. You get a full buzz of them all. You also need a transformation that you can believe and this one has three distinct ones - ones that enlighten and remind you of who you are under the layers of own defense mechanisms.Not to give the movie away, Eastwood plays a broken person whose world view is altered by the love of a neighbor - a persistent young Asian woman with a terrific personality and courageous wit. Her way of relating to others flips Eastwood's character and opens him up.The Gran Torino automobile owned by Eastwood's character is an object of obsession that pulls the diverse characters into dramatic conflict. It's the prop that Eastwood uses as the director/producer to weave the story. This story intrigues and pulls in the viewer. I literally left my model of the world and walked into Eastwood's.I never saw the end coming. I didn't suspect it. How could I? I don't think anything like this exists in the archives of filmography.

1209203,AYKM1B74OLEVC,B001KVZ6ES,Story Charts,"[0, 0]","Gran Torino is about a prejudiced old man stuck in all his ways who makes unlikely friends with his Asian neighbors, two teenage kids. When the kids are threatened by an Asian gang, the old man protects them in the only way he knows how, with a rifle he used in the war. Violence leads to more violence and in the end he sacrifices his own life to give his friends a chance at a normal life.Gran Torino is a fantastic story well told. It employs all three types of plots: an external journey to save the kids, a relationship development of the friendship between the old man and the Asian kids, and an internal arc of the oldman overcoming his prejudices. In the end, the old man does what would have been unthinkable for him at the beginning of the film: sacrifice his own life for his gooky neighbors.The themes of prejudice is echoed well in the supporting action in the film: Walt's ridicule of the good intentioned priest, the rejection of his own family and his war-bred nature to pull out a gun at the slightest possibility of provocation.My only beef of the film is that while it gives a strong platform for an ensemble of Asian actors, they are portrayed as fairly flat and undeveloped and some of their arcs are sacrificed for comedic relief.

1209212,A2UP5W1BHNXMOD,B001KVZ6ES,Ter,"[2, 6]","Clint Eastwood in his late seventies has the title role in this film, and he more than makes the most of it.  Anyone who saw ""Tightrope"" years ago knows the man can act, and he's even better here than he was then.  His Walt Kowalski is a man embittered by his armed service in Korea, his wife dying, his lack of real communication with his children, his neighborhood's erosion from all white to people of color...in short, there's nothing he ISN'T embittered about.  It would be very easy to dislike or even hate Walt, but that's the beauty of Eastwood: he makes you understand and empathize with Walt, even while being appalled at his insensitivity.  Other reviewers have gone into the plot, so I won't here.  The performances are all strong, but the one that especially stood out in my opinion was the priest.  The priest was a difficult role, because he keeps popping up like an overanxious car salesman--- simply because he promised Walt's wife to do something and he keeps trying to do it, while Walt just as determinedly keeps resisting it.  The casting was superb.  The actor looks like a young Spencer Tracy and  more than held his own against Eastwood's crusty curmudgeon.The only thing I really had a problem with was the ending.  The entire film sets you up emotionally for a certain finale, and then goes in a totally unexpected different direction.  Without giving anything away, I found it difficult to believe that Walt would intentionally do what he did.  Was the doctor visit supposed to be what pushed him over the edge?  Was he just tired?  Did he just stop caring, or what?  It seemed to me that a man who spent his whole life emotionally shutting down would not suddenly change at the last minute.

I wasn't dissappointed by it but it also wasn't what I expected, actually I thought this was gonna be more of a shoot em up with Clint behind the gun's but was kinda wrong, in a way. I didn't expect the racism and I didn't expect the ending that was. Clint is a ex Korean War Vet who just so happen's to live in a neighborhood full of Koreans, which by the way he dislikes and has names for them like ""Zipperhead, Swamp Rats and Gooks"". His wife has just died and the family is at the funeral, the family in which Clint Dislikes. After the funeral they end up at his house and find out more to why he dislikes his family (they just want him for what he has). Anyhow his next door neighbors have kids which are teenaged Koreans, one boy one girl. So one day the korean boy is walking home when he is approached by a gang of mexicans who mess with him. All of a sudden the korean boy cousin and his gang come around a corner and see whats going on. They come up on the mexicans and guns flash but no shots and the mexicans drive off, so his cousin and friends try to get him to join their gang but thats not the kinda of boy he is. But soon enough they convince him to try and join and the only way to get in the gang is to steal Clints Grand Torino. The boy ends up trying but gets caught by clint and almost gets shot, the only shot Clint fires in the whole movie. After that the boys cousin and friends end up attacking him on Clints front lawn and Clint pulls out his gun and tells em to get lost. After that the whole neighborhood starts to like Clint for saving the boy, but its praise he does not want. He finally gives in one day as the korean boys sister becomes friends with Clint. He starts to go around and let them come around him more often and he becomes friends with the family including the boy who tryed to steal his car and ends up taking the boy under his wing and shows him how to become more of a man. Soon Clint starts to really connect with the 2 kids and see them as more of a family than his actual family. I really don't wanna tell the whole story but it really is an excellent one. Its funny at times and is to me very sad. There is quite a few racist remarks in this movie but nothing really that bad if you can see past them. I really liked Anhey Her, which is the sister and thought she did an excellent job. Oh and the ended was not what I thought it was gonna be but wasn't bad, just sad.

1209215,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B001KVZ6ES,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[3, 19]","Conjuring up elements of both Harry Calahan and William Munny, Clint Eastwood's Walt Kowalski doesn't quite near the brilliance of his previous creations, but a healthy mix of drama, pathos, and an unexpected dose of wit result in a wholly enjoyable experience.  With all the incarnations of this familiar storyline, perhaps nothing new is truly offered, but if Gran Torino teaches us anything, it's that you don't mess with Clint Eastwood.Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is a perpetually disgruntled, ornery widower who speaks his mind, especially when it comes to his distaste for religion and his new Korean neighbors.  When he unwittingly saves young Thao (Bee Vang) from a violent gang after finding the youth attempting to steal his prized Gran Torino, Walt determines to reform the boy and an unlikely friendship forms.  But as Walt helps Thao gain confidence and a little worldly wisdom, he realizes that only he can bring justice to the gang that continues to threaten the wellbeing of his new friend.With a precise army snare drum accompaniment, a permanent scowl, and hilariously racist dialogue, Clint Eastwood's Walt Kowalsi is a return to a character audiences love. It's not dissimilar to Will Munny from Unforgiven, and the strong vigilante presence is often cinematic gold. Idiosyncratic and bitter, Walt is the perfect contrast for the much younger supporting characters he interacts with, as well as an opposite for the Hmong traditions he interferes in. The story itself is a far cry from the poignant and heartbreaking sagas Eastwood told with his previous films (Million Dollar Baby, Letters From Iwo Jima and most recently Changeling), but clearly this is a character study. His disgust with religion, inability to let go of the past, the horrible things he witnessed in Korea that can't be forgotten, and the destruction of his lawn gnomes all provoke him to set off on a mission of retribution, defiance and principle that makes for an entertaining journey.The originality of the film is greatly lost simply because of his role in Unforgiven, Dirty Harry and other films that make use of his most famous, irritable vigilante persona. While the story doesn't offer too many surprises, the humor is undeniably refreshing. Walt's attempts to teach Thao how to speak like a real man, his advice on love, and his acquisition of a construction job all provide generous laughs. Although most of it is derived from crude racial slurs, it's still quite funny.

1209218,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B001KVZ6ES,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[3, 3]","Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood), a retired Ford Assembly Worker, living in the Detroit neighborhood he has called home for decades, is one racist man. Archie Bunker would turn red and blush if he were to hear some of the things coming from Walt's mouth. But this is what makes Eastwood's performance so interesting and believable. Because Walt is so unapologetically racist, he gets involved with a number of people and in a number of situations that he would normally have shied away from. But these same situations and people start to give his life new meaning and new purpose. That said, the best thing about ""Gran Torino"" is that even if Walt becomes more accepting of his neighbors and their customs, he doesn't stop being racist and sort of uses it as a crutch to remain a little detached from them.Walt's wife has just died and he is not happy to see his grand kids show up at the funeral late, in completely inappropriate attire and playing with their game boys and cell phones. At the wake, back at his house, his grand daughter hints/ asks him who might get his mint condition 1972 Gran Torino when he dies. He scowls at her and walks away. He scowls at his son, a Toyota salesman before the family drives away, relieved to have completed their family duty for the day. After the wake, he sits on his porch with his faithful Lab, drinking Pabst, watching his neighbors, scowling at them. He sees a bunch of Asian faces where there used to be nice, Caucasian American families. Families that kept their houses neat and tidy. He watches a bunch of people entering the house next door and we soon learn that Sue (Ahney Tor) and her younger brother, Thao (Bee Vang) are living with their mother. Sue is smart and doesn't take any crap from Walt, trying to educate him about her family and her people. Soon, Thao is forced into an initiation prank by one of his cousins, who is eager for Thao to join his gang. They want Thao to steal Walt's Gran Torino. Walt puts a kibosh on the effort, scares the young man and forbids Thao from ever stepping on his property again. But Sue and her mom insist that Thao has disgraced them and must work off his shame. Walt puts him to work in a unique way and he grows a little fond of the young man, recognizing that he needs a male influence in his life. But the cousin's gang is becoming more persistent and Walt decides to put a stop to this.There are so many elements in ""Gran Torino"" that shouldn't work, that don't have a right to work, but in the hands of Eastwood, one of the most competent and reliable directors working today, these same elements seem to be slight obstacles, leading him to a better film, a more interesting film.Eastwood is basically the only 'name' in the film and this could be problematic. But in a way, it proves to be a smart choice, very smart. Because Eastwood is surrounding himself with a cast of largely unknown actors, he diminishes himself and makes Walt seem more real. Yes, it's Clint Eastwood playing the role, but he blends into the woodwork more when people who just look more normal surround him.Walking a little slower, speaking in a low surly voice, we get the picture of Walt very quickly. Walt spent many years on the Ford Assembly line and takes great pride in the work he did and in the work he still does around the house. For this reason, when he scans his neighborhood and sees paint peeling or missing roof shingles, it breaks his heart a little, causing him to feel a little more defeated each day. It's also a huge disappointment that his grandkids aren't more respectful and that his son makes a living, a good living selling Toyotas. So, when the Asian people begin to move in, he stares at them with a sneer, never bothering to say hello or offer his name. They are one of the many problems leading to the downfall of his neighborhood, which contributes to his sadness.But Walt is also tough and isn't about to let some punk kid steal a car he himself helped to build. He scares the kid off; Thao didn't want to do it anyway, feeling pressured into the prank by his cousin and his buddies. But Walt also recognizes that Thao needs some help, some guidance. He's basically a good kid, so Walt agrees to let him work off his shame. As he does this, doing many tasks around the neighborhood, Walt seems to delight when the neighbors start requesting Walt send Thao to their house. He also recognizes that Thao needs some guidance, to stay away from the gangs, to stay out of jail. So, he takes on the project.As Walt becomes more familiar with Thao and Sue, their mother and grandmother, his world begins to expand. Thankfully, this is a slow and laborious process. He initially eschews the gifts the neighbors bring him after he helps Thao and Sue, but when Walt gets a taste of the food, he starts to accept it, the Mung ladies of the neighborhood showering him with enough food to make him fat.But the cousin is also persistent and his gang won't take no from Thao, so they become more violent. Initially, Walt is able to simply beat them up, but they have guns and egos and return. With each return, the level of potential violence increases and Walt soon realizes he has to do something or these two kids won't have a chance.The two kids who play Sue and Thao are both good and complete unknowns. It was smart of Eastwood to cast these new actors in these roles, making their performances seem more lifelike and interesting. They could be playing themselves for all we know. Perhaps they have experienced similar circumstances in their already young lives. Maybe not, but their performances give no hint to professional training and each seems perfectly natural.The young gang members are the showiest and therefore the most theatrical. They are right on the verge of becoming caricatures, but Eastwood pulls them back just enough and there is a hint of the insecure kid in each of them which prompts them to join a gang in the first place. This very insecurity is what leads them to try to recruit Thao, they watch as a very similar car of Latino gang members bullies him.It seems like a lot of the movie is spent watching Walt sit on his porch, drinking beer, watching the neighborhood as he silently stews. This should help contribute to a boring film, but because we are watching Eastwood, our eyes never leave the screen. As he sits and watches, we can almost see the thoughts going through his mind; why did Mrs. Panacek leave the neighborhood and sell her house to the Asians who are no unable to mow the yard. This used to be such a nice neighborhood. I remember playing catch with my two sons on this street, in the middle of the street, waving to the neighbors as they return home. As we watch him, we begin to imagine all of these things and, some of which he hints at later, and it helps his character become very well rounded.The trailers for the film hint at a showdown between Eastwood's Walt and the gang harassing Thao and Sue. In so many films, the characters lose all credibility when they suddenly become great marksmen and are able to dispatch villains with a single shot. But in ""Gran Torino"", a lot of the story helps to ground Walt's ability to deal so well with these thugs, and others he comes across, so much so that these inevitable confrontations seem natural. He simply can't stand by while people are harassed and bullied by others, even if he doesn't completely accept the people he is trying to help.Because Walt is so unapologetically racist, it takes a while before we begin to like him, every time he sees someone of color, he uses a racial epitaph to address them. But as he gets to know Sue and Thao, and their mother and grandmother, he begins to use these same epitaphs more because he is expected to, to get a little giggle from Sue, to cause her to raise and eyebrow and instruct him in all the ways he is a stupid old man. He uses them to get attention.In fact, so many people in the film are racist, to varying degrees, Walt, who is the worst, begins to seem even more natural because of this character flaw. The Asian gang hates the Latino gang. Some black kids on a corner harass Sue because she is Asian. Walt and his barber, who is Italian, exchange barbed words, trying to shock one another.In fact, as Walt gets to know Sue and her family, she realizes that Walt's bark is worse than his bite and these racist moments make her giggle and laugh. As he becomes more familiar with them, and likewise, his racism seems to get even worse, because he knows the kids in the family will get a kick out of him mangling their names, or consciously trying to confuse their customs.And as he gets to know this family more, he becomes a little more accepting of them. He realizes Thao needs a male influence and tries to help him become more of a man, to get a job and start to make a life for himself.The films emotionally wrenching climax is also well earned. Naturally, you expect some sort of confrontation to close the film, but it happens in an unexpected way with unexpected results.""Gran Torino"" is an excellent film providing us with an emotional story about a fairly unique individual and the people who change his life and how he changes theirs.",5,"Eastwood's ""Gran"" Tour",1231718400,"01 12, 2009",2009,9197,"['Walt', 'Kowalski', 'Clint',

1209219,A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B001KVZ6ES,"Tim Brough ""author and music buff""","[1, 2]","I may be one of the few to think ""Gran Torino"" to be an over-rated movie. But watching Clint Eastwood play a cranky old racist who finally gets melted by a pair of adolescent Asian immigrants felt wholly contrived to me. Walt (Eastwood) has shiftless and greedy family members who he can't stand, neighbors that disgust him, a young priest who he treats like a punk and a few old cronies at the bar he can make racist jokes with. But when he discovers the kid who first tried to steal the Gran Torino of the film's title ain't the gang-banging type, Walt decides he will make a real man out of the kid and make up for the failed sons he thinks he didn't teach right.Which makes him the Cop from the even worse movie, ""Crash."" ""Gran Torino"" earns its fourth star based on Eastwood, who plays Walt with such effortless slyness that he manages to coast through the movie on sheer force of will. The other is the teenage Hmong sister Sue (Ahney Her), who has picked up American spunk and sasses to Walt in a manner that makes him learn acceptance (sort of). When Walt stops a bunch of gang members from attacking Sue and her brother (with the infamous ""Get off my lawn"" trailer quote), Walt becomes their reluctant hero...and the gang's new enemy.As the conflict builds and Walt moves towards the inevitable gang showdown, ""Gran Torino"" stumbles.

1209223,A26MQ4YGVS5CC2,B001KVZ6ES,Todd Bartholomew,"[2, 2]","I initially begged off seeing ""Gran Torino"" as I assumed I got the gist from preview trailers, but you know what happens when you assume, right?  I was expecting the clich&eacute;d Clint Eastwood ending and after seeing ""Gran Torino"" was instead quite stunned and surprised, yet I shouldn't have been.  If anything Eastwood has evolved far beyond the ""Dirty Harry"" days and if anything has become as much as an artist in front of the lens as behind it.  Thinking of his more recent movies, Eastwood has transcended his earlier on-screen personas and evolved into something far deeper.""Gran Torino"" is as much character driven as plot driven and Eastwood's character Harvey Kowalski is as much the antithesis of Dirty Harry as he is the antithesis of a vigilante.  A retired autoworker and Korean War Veteran, Kowalski is also a recent widower watching the transition and decline of his Detroit neighborhood where he and his late wife raised their children.  When touching on his somewhat estranged children ""Gran Torino"" becomes a vehicle for satire, emphasizing the dislocation and detachment of modern society.  Kowalski feels about as connected to his children and grandchildren as he does to the equally alien Hmong family next door.  Opening with the funeral service for his late wife ""Gran Torino"" sets the tableau of dislocation and despair in his neighborhood.  Kowalski's antagonism and dislocation with seemingly everyone is pled out with his neighbors, his children, the parish priest, and his neighborhood.  The feelings of rejection and helplessness pervade the movie: children give up on parents, parents give up on children, neighbors give up on their community and the community crumbles around them.  Without giving the plot away events unfold where Kowalski feels compelled to intervene on behalf of his neighbors and the community reacts in a way that catches Kowalski off-guard.  Slowly Kowalski is pulled closer into the Hmong community as he grapples with his wartime demons and his distant children.  The closer Kowalski gets to the Hmong the more the film builds to its stunning climax, and the climax is unlike anything you'd expect form a Clint Eastwood movie.I don't want to spoil the ending, but much like ""Million Dollar Baby"" and other recent Eastwood movies your mouth will be hanging open as it is not the ending you would expect.  That's because Eastwood has truly become the cinematic master, defying expectations and here offering up a sharp contrast that made me a fan of his work all over again.  There wasn't as much violence as I expected, and Eastwood totally chews up the scenery with an economy of words that are truly impressive.  His facial expressions communicate more than words ever could.  There is some VERY politically incorrect language presented quite frankly here but it serves a purpose.  I'd questioned how good ""Gran Torino"" could be and it is easily one of the best movies of the past year, if not one of Eastwood's best.  It is a fitting coda to every Dirty Harry movie and all of his Spaghetti Westerns rolled into one.  I've often thought that Eastwood approaches each film as though it might be his last and never holds anything back.  If ""Gran Torino"" were to be his final film it would be hard to imagine going out on a better note!",5,Just when you think you know Clint Eastwood...,1249862400,"08 10, 2009",2009,3295,"['initially', 'begged', 'off', 'seeing', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'assumed', 'got', 'gist', 'preview', 'trailers', 'know', 'what', 'when', 'assume', 'right', 'was', 'expecting', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'ending', 'seeing', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'was', 'instead', 'quite', 'stunned', 'surprised', 'yet', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'anything', 'Eastwood', 'evolved', 'far', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'days', 'anything', 'become', 'as', 'much', 'artist', 'front', 'lens', 'Thinking', 'more', 'recent', 'movies', 'Eastwood', 'transcended', 'earlier', 'on-screen', 'personas', 'evolved', 'something', 'far', 'deeper', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'as', 'much', 'character', 'driven', 'plot', 'driven', 'Eastwood', 'character', 'Harvey', 'Kowalski', 'as', 'much', 'antithesis', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'antithesis', 'vigilante', 'retired', 'autoworker', 'Korean', 'War', 'Veteran', 'Kowalski', 'also', 'recent', 'widower', 'watching', 'transition', 'decline', 'Detroit', 'neighborhood', 'where', 'late', 'wife', 'raised', 'children', 'When', 'touching', 'somewhat', 'estranged', 'children', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'vehicle', 'satire', 'emphasizing', 'dislocation', 'detachment', 'modern', 'society', 'Kowalski', 'as', 'connected', 'children', 'grandchildren', 'equally', 'alien', 'Hmong', 'family', 'next', 'door', 'Opening', 'funeral', 'service', 'late', 'wife', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'tableau', 'dislocation', 'despair', 'neighborhood', 'Kowalski', 'antagonism', 'dislocation', 'seemingly', 'everyone', 'pled', 'out', 'neighbors', 'children', 'parish', 'priest', 'neighborhood', 'feelings', 'rejection', 'helplessness', 'pervade', 'movie', 'children', 'give', 'up', 'parents', 'parents', 'give', 'up', 'children', 'neighbors', 'give', 'up', 'community', 'community', 'giving', 'plot', 'away', 'events', 'unfold', 'where', 'Kowalski', 'compelled', 'intervene', 'behalf', 'neighbors', 'community', 'way', 'Kowalski', 'off-guard', 'Slowly', 'Kowalski', 'pulled', 'closer', 'Hmong', 'community', 'wartime', 'demons', 'distant', 'children', 'closer', 'Kowalski', 'Hmong', 'more', 'film', 'stunning', 'climax', 'climax', 'anything', ""'d"", 'expect', 'form', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'movie.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'ending', 'much', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'other', 'recent', 'Eastwood', 'movies', 'mouth', 'will', 'be', 'hanging', 'open', 'not', 'ending', 'would', 'expect', 'because', 'Eastwood', 'truly', 'become', 'cinematic', 'master', 'defying', 'expectations', 'here', 'offering', 'up', 'sharp', 'contrast', 'made', 'fan', 'work', 'over', 'again', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'much', 'violence', 'expected', 'Eastwood', 'totally', 'up', 'scenery', 'economy', 'words', 'are', 'truly', 'impressive', 'facial', 'expressions', 'communicate', 'more', 'words', 'ever', 'could', 'VERY', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'language', 'presented', 'quite', 'frankly', 'here', 'purpose', ""'d"", 'questioned', 'how', 'good', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'could', 'be', 'easily', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'past', 'year', 'not', 'one', 'Eastwood', 'best', 'fitting', 'coda', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'movie', 'Spaghetti', 'Westerns', 'rolled', 'one', ""'ve"", 'often', 'thought', 'Eastwood', 'film', 'might', 'be', 'last', 'never', 'anything', 'back', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'were', 'be', 'final', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'imagine', 'going', 'out', 'better', 'note']",Gran Torino

Walt Kowalski, as Clint portrays him, reflects quite accurately just what my father's and uncles' (old-fashioned) Polish characters were very much like. We also had Italian in-laws in the family... and the exchange of verbiage, during family get-togethers, was a lot like that which occurred between Walt and his barber in the movie.The movie does reveal a marvelous fluidity of Walt's character; Walt does drop much of his ingrained structures of prejudice, at times... and this change from prejudice to compassion is very bright and sunny.  Humanity can change from rigid perspectives to more insightful and compassionate intelligence.As an aging man, I could relate to Walt's sagacious reflections and physical ailments and problems.  My favorite philosopher, J.Krishnamurti (who lived part of each year in Ojai, California), when he was alive, was very appreciative of many of Clint's films; Krishnamurti died at the age of 91.

1209225,A4JHEO7H330AF,B001KVZ6ES,Tom Brody,"[2, 2]","GRAN TORINO was directed by Mr. Clint Eastwood and it stars Mr. Eastwood. The story was by Dave Johannson and Nick Schenk.  The movie lives and breathes humanity. The movie is almost like a melange of CRASH (2004) starring Matt Dillon, ALL IN THE FAMILY (1971-1979) starring Caroll O'Conner, and MEN OF HONOR (2000) starring Cuba Gooding. On one or two occasions, GRAN TORINO shows the grittiness of THE PAWNBROKER starring Rod Steiger.  Throughout the film, there are near-continual undercurrents of tension, where one might expect an outburst of some sort to occur.  There are no weak periods in this film.  There is no filler in this film.Here are a few comments:(A)  MEDIATING BETWEEN TWO CULTURES.  Ahney Her, who plays Mr.Eastwood's neighbor, will steal your heart.  She serves as a go-between, mediating communication between the traditional American culture and the traditional Hmong culture.  She is fluent in the Hmong language, and fluent in English, and she has no trace of accent when she speaks English.  The film becomes ever the more powerful, towards the end, when she become a tragic figure.  The Hmong language actually consists of a group of dialects, spoken by Hmong people of Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, northern Vietnam, Thailand, and Laos.(B)  WHAT MATTERS MOST IN LIFE.  The film identifies what is the meaning of life.  For some people, the essence of the meaning of life is to discover the cure for cancer.  This goal is reachable by only a select few, such as Prof.D.Slamon, the inventor of trastuzumab.  But for others, such as the character played by Mr.Eastwood, meaning of life comes from teaching somebody self-respect, and teaching somebody a new skill.  Perhaps, that is what GRAN TORINO is all about.(C)  SELF-SACRIFICE.  Regarding the ending of the film, this film takes exactly the same approach as that taken in Mr.Eastwood's other movie, SPACE COWBOYS.  The approach is this.  A man who knows he is terminally ill sacrifices himself to do a good deed.  This approach is emphasized by a crack in the sidewalk, in a scene at the end of GRAN TORINO.  The use of this symbolic crack is a work of pure genius. (I'm not telling you what it is. There is no need for a ""spoiler alert"" at this point.)(D) CIGARETTE LIGHTER.  This is about the cigarette lighter bearing an insignia.  GRAN TORINO has the recurring theme of a cigarette lighter bearing an insignia.  This exact theme occurs in STRANGERS ON A TRAIN, an Alfred Hitchcock movie.  In STRANGER ON A TRAIN, the lighter has a picture of golf clubs, a symbol dear to the heart of the protagonist.  In GRAN TORINO, the lighter had a symbol of a U.S. military group from the Korean war, a symbol dear to the heart of the protagonist. My understanding is that STRANGER ON A TRAIN is frequently used as a teaching device in film school.  Hence, the use of this particular theme in GRAN TORINO cannot be said to be a coincidence.  There is nothing wrong with recycling themes.  In fact, when themes are recycled, this enables contemporary cinematographers to stand on the shoulders of earlier cinematographic giants (to paraphrase Isaac Newton).(E) CATHOLICISM.  GRAN TORINO is a fine educational device for those interested in knowing what is Catholicism.  For those totally naive in matters relating to Christianity, and to Catholicism in particular, this movie seems to provide a practical, fair-minded, and favorable accounting of this religion.  In contrast, it is the case that many other Hollywood productions characterize Catholicism as a cult that is obsessed with witch hunting and exorcism, or as a religion for simpletons (as in, AS GOOD AS IT GETS, starring Helen Hunt as the Catholic).(F)  STAR WARS CANTINA SCENE.  GRAN TORINO never lets up with its continual entourage of clever scenes.  When Mr.Eastwood eventually goes to the clinic, he finds himself in a waiting room filled with foreigners.  There is an Indian woman.  There is an East Asian man.  The receptionist is Ethiopian Moslem woman.  When the receptionist calls out, ""Mister Kowalski,"" her accent is so strong, one can almost feel Mr.Eastwood cringing because of how poorly his name is being pronounced.  By the time this scene arrives, the viewer of GRAN TORINO is already aware that the qualities of Mr.Eastwood's neighborhood that were known to him, from the happy years 1950 to 1980, have simply disintegrated into nothingness.  To avoid dropping into the hole of existential nothingness, Mr.Eastwood clings to the few remaining things that he can, almost obsessively so.  These include Mr.Eastwood's unending parade of Pabst beer, his Italian barber friend, and the rituals of mowing his lawn and polishing his GRAN TORINO.  Anyway, the scene at the waiting room in the doctor's office, with its bizarre melange of different nationalities, reminded me of the STAR WARS cantina scene in located in the city of Mos Eisley on the planet Tatooine.(G)  NAMES.  Naming is a concept normally studied by Ph.D. students in philosphy, psychology, and literature.  Thousands of college professors have carved out their career by studying the symbolism of names, that is, names of characters in books and plays.  This particular movie contains the interesting theme of names.  Towards the beginning of GRAN TORINO, Clint Eastwood complains when the priest calls him ""Walt,"" and demands that he be called, ""Mr. Kowalski.""  Eventually, Mr.Eastwood softens, and reluctantly allows the priest to call him, ""Walt.""  At about the same time, Ahney Her, the charming Hmong teenager, calls him, ""Wally.""  Mr.Eastwood raises a protest, but it is modest, and he finds himself feeling comfortable when Ahney Her calls him, ""Wally.""  An explanation is at hand.  What does the priest have to offer Mr.Eastwood?  Nothing.  And what does Ahney Her have to offer Mr.Eastwood?  Plenty -- her family provides him with tasks that provide meaning to his life, including, making humble household repairs, teaching Ahney's brother how to talk like a confident man, teaching Ahney's brother a trade (carpentry), and protecting Ahney from neighborhood gangs.  Then, towards the end of the movie, the issue of names comes up again in the clinic, where the Ethiopian reception mangles Mr.Eastwood's name to the point where it is almost unrecognizable.  She calls, ""Mister Kwaaski?  Mister Kwaaski?""(H)  AIRHEAD.  This is about actor Dreama Walker.  Ms. Dreama Walker is a professional actor who has been in dozens of films.  She plays the airhead.  Her character is simultaneously charming and nauseating.  Dreama Walker's character fits squarely in the tradition established by Alicia Silverstone in CLUELESS and by Moon Unit Zappa in her song, VALLEY GIRL.  The airhead seems to be a new literary invention, as I am not sure if any character of this type has ever appeared, for example, in the works of Charles Dickens, Mark Twain, Moliere, or Shakespeare.No review can do justice to the intelligence, insight, humor, and humanity, that is found in GRAN TORINO.  While this film certainly does not provide insight regarding EVERY aspect of the human condition, it does provide a compelling narrative regarding relations between young versus old, American versus foreign, naive versus savvy, and so on.  As a comment on the ""human condition,"" I find this film is as remarkable as any piece of literature coming from the pen of Shakespeare, Dostoyevski, or Melville.  But a difference between GRAN TORINO and the works of Shakespeare, Dostoyevski, and Melville, is that you do not need a Ph.D. in literature to understand GRAN TORINO.

I do know that it received some critical acclaim and that neighbors who saw it liked it...but that's not surprising considering it's a Clint Eastwood Joint.  I love Clint, but everyone loved 'Mystic River' and 'Million Dollar Baby' (more like 'Million Dollar Boredom') and I thought those movies were boring as hell.Let me say before I swiftly bash this movie that Clint Eastwood is arguably the greatest of movie stars.  This guy has been in more classics and played some of the terrific characters to ever grace the silver screen.My guess is that this will be his last starring role and maybe that was what he intended when making it.  It doesn't really end the way most Eastwood films end in that he kills just about everyone in his path.  Maybe this is just a metaphor for a 'dying movie star', so to speak.  The way Harry Callahan or Philo Beddoe or Blondie would have handled these situations...well there would be some bodies left behind and/or a lot of people severely beaten left in his dust.  This isn't a bad thing, but the message I got from the ending was that Clint is showing us that he doesn't have to use his guns or fists as he rides off into the sunset as a motion picture actor.'Gran Torino' isn't really much of anything, really.  I can tell you that the script is appallingly bad and the acting by absolutely everyone involved is even worse.It's grumpy old man who hates everyone befriends neighbors he despises because he opens his heart up when they leave flowers and chicken dumplings on his doorstep.  Perhaps those relationships would be more entertaining and believable if ANYONE in that house next door could act a lick or was remotely likable.The first hour and twenty minutes are a complete and total bore and you will be asking whoever is unfortunate enough to suffer through it along with you, ""What the hell is this movie about?""  At least something actually takes place in the last twenty minutes of the thing, but the closure is a major disappointment.I don't know if this is supposed to be about what Rocky Balboa told all of those Soviets in 'Rocky IV' about ""If I can change and you can change, EVERYBODY can change"" or what...but it was very, very bland, boring and horribly acted.  It would be a better story if he finally found good in some people upon opening his mind/heart and actually spoke to his children every once in awhile, but that whole scenario is just tossed under the door mat.I hate to think that this could be (and probably is) Clint's final starring role.  He's probably my favorite 'movie star', but I'm not going to bow down for him just because it's him like everyone in Hollywood seemed to do upon this release.Just say no to the Gran Torino, ya dig??",1,"Almost Everyone Went A Little Overboard, Here",1249862400,"08 10, 2009",2009,2777,"['had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'lot', ""'Gran"", 'Torino', 'prior', 'renting', 'do', 'know', 'received', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'neighbors', 'who', 'saw', 'liked', 'not', 'surprising', 'considering', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Joint', 'love', 'Clint', 'everyone', 'loved', ""'Mystic"", 'River', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'more', ""'Million"", 'Dollar', 'Boredom', 'thought', 'movies', 'were', 'boring', 'hell.Let', 'say', 'swiftly', 'bash', 'movie', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'arguably', 'greatest', 'movie', 'stars', 'guy', 'been', 'more', 'classics', 'played', 'terrific', 'characters', 'ever', 'grace', 'silver', 'screen.My', 'guess', 'will', 'be', 'last', 'starring', 'role', 'maybe', 'was', 'what', 'intended', 'when', 'making', ""n't"", 'really', 'end', 'way', 'most', 'Eastwood', 'films', 'end', 'just', 'everyone', 'path', 'Maybe', 'just', 'metaphor', ""'dying"", 'movie', 'star', 'speak', 'way', 'Harry', 'Callahan', 'Philo', 'Beddoe', 'Blondie', 'would', 'have', 'handled', 'situations', 'well', 'would', 'be', 'bodies', 'left', 'behind', 'lot', 'people', 'severely', 'beaten', 'left', 'dust', ""n't"", 'bad', 'thing', 'message', 'got', 'ending', 'was', 'Clint', 'showing', ""n't"", 'have', 'use', 'guns', 'fists', 'sunset', 'motion', 'picture', 'actor', 'Torino', ""n't"", 'really', 'much', 'anything', 'really', 'can', 'tell', 'script', 'appallingly', 'bad', 'acting', 'absolutely', 'everyone', 'involved', 'even', 'worse.It', 'grumpy', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'everyone', 'neighbors', 'heart', 'up', 'when', 'leave', 'flowers', 'chicken', 'dumplings', 'doorstep', 'Perhaps', 'relationships', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'entertaining', 'believable', 'ANYONE', 'house', 'next', 'door', 'could', 'act', 'lick', 'was', 'remotely', 'likable.The', 'first', 'hour', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'are', 'complete', 'total', 'bore', 'will', 'be', 'asking', 'whoever', 'unfortunate', 'enough', 'suffer', 'along', 'What', 'hell', 'movie', 'least', 'something', 'actually', 'place', 'last', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'thing', 'closure', 'major', 'disappointment.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'supposed', 'be', 'what', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'told', 'Soviets', ""'Rocky"", 'IV', 'can', 'change', 'can', 'change', 'EVERYBODY', 'can', 'change', 'what', 'was', 'very', 'very', 'bland', 'boring', 'horribly', 'acted', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'story', 'finally', 'found', 'good', 'people', 'opening', 'mind/heart', 'actually', 'spoke', 'children', 'once', 'awhile', 'whole', 'scenario', 'just', 'tossed', 'door', 'mat.I', 'hate', 'think', 'could', 'be', 'probably', 'Clint', 'final', 'starring', 'role', 'probably', 'favorite', 'star', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'bow', 'down', 'just', 'everyone', 'Hollywood', 'seemed', 'do', 'release.Just', 'say', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'ya', 'dig']",Gran Torino

1209232,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B001KVZ6ES,Turfseer,"[2, 5]","When we first meet Walt Kowalski, the bigoted but lovable curmudgeon played by Clint Eastwood, he's coping with the loss of his wife of many years. During the funeral and reception at the house afterward, his sons are shown having a hard time coping with their father who doesn't have a good word to say about anybody. But soon it's clear that the film's scenarists are setting us up to view Walt as misanthropic but at the same a far better man than his offspring who are busy with their own lives and don't have their father's best interests at heart. Worse is the granddaughter, a narcissistic teenager who shows little sensitivity during a tragic time of grief (the portrait of the detached granddaughter, completely one-dimensional, is designed to contrast with the much more real and sensitive Sue, the young Hmong woman, that Walt is soon to befriend).Sue, played by the excellent Ahney Her, is probably the most engaging character in the film. She's the one who gets Walt to open up as she brings him over to meet her family and introduce him to the Hmong culture. Not only did I enjoy the banter between the two characters but had the distinct impression that Ms. Her was not acting--that she was simply playing herself! Every time Walt would make an ignorant, bigoted remark, she wouldn't get angry but simply contradict him and explain why he was wrong. He opens up to her precisely because of her patience and insight into both her own people and the outside American culture. She's an all-knowing guide and in a sense hearkens back to the 'wisdom' character in the Bible and other ancient writings.To the screenwriters' credit, gang culture is not sanitized. Not only are members of the Hmong gang shown to be what they are (vicious and aimless young people who want to make everybody else's lives miserable) but the black gang members are also shown to be equally vicious. And even better, most of the Gran Torino story is not about the gang members but the relationship between Walt and the two young Hmong people who help him to find some purpose in his life.As the Gran Torino story unfolds, certain things don't ring true. One thing that bothered me quite a bit was Walt's complete ignorance of who the Hmong people were. Here's a guy who presumably has been living in this neighborhood for many years, all his neighbors are Hmong people, and it's up to Sue to explain to him where the Hmong came from. Despite his prejudices, Walt is not a stupid person. He would have known the difference between the Hmong and say the Vietnamese people simply from his conversations with his friends in the neighborhood (such as his friend the barber, the construction foreman or any of his buddies at the various bars he frequents).Gran Torino is full of 'trash talk' mainly emanating from Walt's foul mouth. Walt and his barber friend trade occasionally amusing insults about each other's ethnic identity. Whether such conversations actually take place in real life is another issue (how a barber would actually like a customer who never tips him seems completely far-fetched).Most of the middle of Gran Torino concerns Walt's quest to turn Thao, Sue's brother, into a 'real man'. Thao doesn't have much of a personality like his sister and his gradual transformation from a shy, detached kid into someone who's hardworking and responsible seemed a bit too predictable. It's hard to believe that Thao is such a complete wuss that the macho pep talk from Walt's construction foreman friend will so easily turn him around.The film's climax is the least believable of all the scenes. We're asked first to believe that Walt would jeopardize Thao and Sue's safety by beating up one of the gang members. After all, he's the guy who later locks Thao in the basement after preventing him from impulsively taking revenge on the gang members. But earlier, Walt is the one who commits the impulsive act which leads to Sue being raped.Now he must undo his own mistake. In a nice twist, instead of turning Gran Torino into a typical revenge fantasy, Eastwood's Kowalski offers himself up as a sacrifice in order to prevent further violence. Perhaps 'Dirty Harry' is maturing in his old age. Furthermore, Clint seems to be softening slightly toward the Catholic church (here he's finally willing to go to confession in contrast to his diatribe against the church's stance against mercy killings which was prominent in Eastwood's earlier film, 'Million Dollar Baby').Nonetheless, the filmmaker's desire to give the audience a bittersweet but upbeat ending by suggesting that the gang members will end up being prosecuted rings false. Why would the neighbors suddenly be willing to testify against the gang members when it's established early on that everyone in the neighborhood is petrified of gang retaliation? No, in real life, odds are that the witnesses wouldn't have come forward to testify against the gang members despite Walt's heroic reputation in the neighborhood.Gran Torino is not always honest and goes out of its way to manipulate your emotions. Nonetheless, it's deftly plotted and will keep your attention throughout. That's no small feat. For all its flaws, it's definitely worth seeing.",4,Deftly plotted narrative trumps improbable tale of Vigilante's change of heart,1236988800,"03 14, 2009",2009,5196,"['When', 'first', 'meet', 'Walt',

1209243,A3N5XIM9R2OQH0,B001KVZ6ES,Wheelchair Assassin,"[3, 3]","If, as I've heard rumored, Gran Torino turns out to mark Clint Eastwood's final film role, he'll at least have gone out with another memorable performance to add to his long list.  Portraying the unlikely friendship that develops between a disaffected 70-something Korean War vet and the son and daughter of a Hmong family that lives next door, the movie is a surprisingly affecting and at times even funny story of personal redemption and cultural collision.  With a backdrop of urban decay and gang violence, it also makes for an interesting portrait of the continuing decline of the American city, even if its ultimate focus is more personal.  Much like The Wrestler, another of the past year's best films, Gran Torino provides a look at the kind of people and areas many of us don't see in our daily lives, let alone in movies, and portrays its characters sympathetically without neglecting their flaws.The film is largely carried by Eastwood, whose well-established tough-guy identity gets a new twist in the form of Walt Kowalski, a retired Ford worker who stubbornly clings to his house and his old-school ways in a Detroit neighborhood that's rapidly being taken over by immigrants and a larger world that no longer seems to be his own.  In a way, Walt represents the flip side of Eastwood's iconic characters and persona: he's The Man With No Name turned into a dinosaur, Dirty Harry rendered irrelevant by changing times.  We first see Walt snarling his way through his beloved wife's funeral, angered by the various signs of modernity he sees around him and the lack of respect shown by his descendents.  As the movie goes on we get a better idea of the reaons for Walt's anger: his sons have grown into suburban yuppies with overprivileged brats for children, and his middle-class neighborhood has come to be dominated by minorities, especially Hmong immigrants whom he describes using a variety of disparaging epithets.  This is clearly a guy who's not too familiar with the concept of political correctness and who feels no need to discard the prejudices he's taken for granted his whole adult life.It would be easy, especially at first, to dismiss Walt as a simple crank and bigot, and while that description wouldn't necessarily be inaccurate it wouldn't tell the whole story either.  In his own way, Walt is an idealist, one who believes in certain values--patriotism, self-sacrifice, hard work, proper lawn care--that he believes (rightly or not) aren't shared by his new neighbors.  As we see through a series of conversations with the well-meaning local priest, Walt has fallen victim in his old age to a combination of cynicism, alienation, and racial hatred, born of his harrowing experiences in Korea and a mounting disgruntlement at a world that's relentlessly changing around him.  The film does do a pretty good job (largely through Walt's growled declarations to himself) of allowing the viewer to see the world through the eyes of an aging man who's surrounded by the unfamiliar and having a hard time adjusting to it.  Charged at age 78 with largely carrying the film, Eastwood has the difficult task of turning Walt from a caricature to fully fleshed-out character over the course of two hours, a feat that few others could pull off but that's helped immensely by his natural gravity and his own gritty, stark direction.While Walt may seem like a giant ball of hate at first, he does eventually start to warm up to his teenaged Hmong neighbor Sue (Ahney Her) and later to her brother Thao (Bee Vang), even after Thao tries to steal Walt's prized 1972 Ford Gran Torino as part of a gang initiation.  The bond that gradually emerges between Walt and Thao may be unlikely at first based on Walt's obvious hostility toward other races, but it eventually comes to seem perfectly natural because they're both committed to maintaining their integrity in a world that doesn't seem to have much room for it.  Thao is trying to make his own way in an immigrant society of limited horizons, with few options for the future beyond taking a menial job or joining his cousin's gang, when Walt sees enough potential in him to try to help him overcome the limitations of his surroundings.  Vang has to turn Thao into a real, conflicted person rather than just an idealized symbol of his people, and while he's not as good as Eastwood he still does an admirable job of keeping up with his legendary costar.  Scenes of Walt developing a comfort level with his Hmong neighbors carry an almost sociological fascination, along with the irony of a cranky old racist getting absorbed into the world of Asian immigrants while his relationships with his own family become increasingly strained.Overall, in spite of a few flaws, Gran Torino manages to be a largely excellent movie.  The opening scenes of Walt expressing his seemingly all-consuming bitterness and hatred can get a bit tiresome, and the ending is a little over-the-top and dramatic compared to what preceded it, but there's still more than enough quality material to make this film worth watching.  The slower, more contemplative middle section is actually the most interesting part of the movie, as we see the challenges faced by both the aging Walt and the coming-of-age Thao in their daily lives, as well as the slow, awkward process of Walt letting his guard down enough to become a mentor to Thao.  Those looking for a change of pace from the never-ending stream of remakes and TV and comic-book adaptations coming out of Hollywood could certainly do a lot worse.",4,Eastwood scores yet

1209248,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B001KVZ6ES,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[2, 4]","I've always had a fondness for Eastwood's direction and films; his latest, ""GRAN TORINO"" may not be his best directorial film assignment but it sure is a welcome addition to his directorial opus. This film is a melodramatic experience (well, Eastwood's performance keep it from becoming a full-blown one) and is a clever character study on racism, friendship and redemption. The film is pretty simple and that is the one element that made it work. Of course, Eastwood relies on his old-school tactics to generate a taut, gripping, and intense experience.Walter Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is a retired mechanic and who has been recently widowed. He tries to keep to himself, tends to his own property and fends off the selfish desires of his grandkids. He watches his old neighborhood and seems like the ""new"" generation of kids nowadays lack any respect whatsoever, and Walt falls into despair. He maintains some prejudice since his bleak days in the Korean war. Walt just minds his own business until he observes the violent predicament of a young Hmong man named Thao (Bee Vang) and he decides to intervene and drives off the gang members and Walt becomes recognized and respected in the Hmong community. He is repulsed by the traditions, but slowly he is won over through Homng cuisine and befriends Thao and his sister, Sue (Ahney Her). Now, Walter has become fond of this huge Asian family, but unfortunately, the Hmong gang situation is about to get much, much worst...and Walter is adamant on getting involved.""Gran Torino"" is simple, the screenplay by Nick Schneke is a no-nonsense, no B.S. type of a deal and may be heavily dipped in Midwestern culture. The story is about an aging ex-military man who is so set in their ways, he finds solace in his own little world, folks like this tend to keep to themselves and they try to stay away from the melting pot that develops around them. Walter's state of nature is the good old-fashioned way of American life, whose life and beliefs may revolve around seemingly outdated values in this day and age. Sure, he does have his share of bigotry but I think it is just his comfort zone and a way of dealing with the things that he has seen. The story is all about respect and finding the means to clear one's conscience. Walter has lived his life and he has nothing to lose.Walt is one very intense individual and you can tell from the get-go that he has a major chip on his shoulder. There are very strong hints that he is not an easy person to get along with, and he has somewhat alienated himself from his family. Now, his health is slowly deteriorating and he still refuses to reach out. (why would he?) Quite ironic and not really surprising that he finds more in common with his next door Asian neighbors, who are from a very different ethnic background and old-school traditions. I think you can see that this is due to the fact that these Asian people have survived many hardships and they can understand him. His own family is basically the new type of generation, his children may have things too easy for them and his grandkids give the impression of a very irresponsible attitude.The film does revolve around its characters, their interactions and their habits--the characters make the story in ""Gran Torino"". The film's dialogue is very strong and much of it does focus on Walter and Thao's relationship who develop an odd friendship after Thao had attempted to steal Walt`s prized car; the 1972 ""classic Gran Torino"". You may say that Walter becomes Thao's father figure somehow. One may also say that the car represents Walt's personality--unchanging that had stood the test of time. I do love Ahney Her's character ""Sue"" as she proves to be the strong anchor between her family and Walt, she does draw out the goodness within this strong-willed ex-military man.Eastwood's direction doesn't go into overdrive into taking the limits of remorse, guilt and hate into account. The direction is kept very simple and it is what made it effective. I also commend the direction that while it does have a serious tone and it remembered to add subtle doses of humor. I really enjoyed the way Eastwood delivered his dialogue and you may say that he is the culmination of most of the characters he has played in the past--think an aged ""Dirty Harry Callahan"". His constant focus on his spitting and his quips about prejudices was humorous, and I think the direction managed to keep a clean execution throughout. The exchanges between Walt and his barber is made for pure fun, as well as Sue calling him ""Wally"".""GRAN TORINO"" has been unofficially promoted as Eastwood's last starring role. The film is very good, and while it may not stand as his best directorial outing, (I think ""Unforgiven"" is still his best) Eastwood's acting portrayal is solid and his role seemed tailor-made for his personality. The direction is brilliantly simple and avoids quite a few melodramatic pitfalls, the climax is very heavy with a symbolic gesture and some audiences may indeed see it a little too polished for a film like this. The film is satisfying enough and I rather welcome Eastwood's return to this type of role. Eastwood's ""Gran Torino"" isn't too concerned with making a huge mark in his resume--and maybe this is the way he wanted it. Going out quietly, with a restrained but powerful impact.Highly Recommended!

1209251,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B001KVZ6ES,Wuchak,"[17, 20]","I ripped-off that title blurb from reviewer Monkdude but it's such an apt description of ""Gran Torino"" I couldn't resist.Clint Eastwood stars as Korean War veteran and retired automaker Walt Kowalski, still living in the old Michigan neighborhood that's falling apart around him (which reminds me of my late grandfather in New Haven). Kowalski's wife has just passed away and he's as cantankerous as ever -- scowling and growling at everyone and everything, including his Hmong neighbors who hail from Laos. Something happens that warms his relations with this family and he slowly becomes closer to them than his own kids and grandchildren. He naturally takes on the father-figure role with the two Hmong teens, in particular mentoring Thao (Bee Vang) on how to be manly and productive. Unfortunately there's a brutal Asian gang that preys on the teens and serious tensions rise. A showdown is inevitable.If you can imagine Dirty Harry in the role as the Asian mentor in ""The Karate Kid"" and the teen as Asian instead of white you'd have a pretty good idea of ""Gran Torino,"" except that the violence is darker and there's profuse cussing throughout.""Gran Torino"" is greatly entertaining throughout its runtime. Although it's a serious drama it's also consistently hilarious without being a comedy, if that makes any sense.Some describe Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) as  racist but this isn't really so. His many racist remarks throughout the film are dispersed evenhanded across the board, whether the recipients are white, Asian, Black or Hispanic. I think he realizes we're all human beings and we all have our strengths and weaknesses, potential for good or bad, regardless of race. His sharp remarks are simply his way of breaking the ice with people and relating to them. He dishes it out but also takes it. I'm not saying it's right, just that it's the way he is. The fact that he isn't really racist is proven by the close relationship he develops with his Hmong neighbors -- closer than his own flesh and blood. Would a real racist be open to such a relationship?A lot of themes are addressed, including second chances -- it's never too late to make up for past mistakes even if you're almost 80 years old. Walt obviously failed to develop close relationships with his two sons but a new ""son"" is thrown into his lap as if a gift from above. This time's he's intent on doing it right.I liked the way the ""generation gap"" is blown to smithereens in the story. Walt and Thao aren't just father/son figures they're friends. I can't help but think of God and Moses (Exodus 33:11) and Jesus and his ""friends"" (John 15:14-15), but I digress.I also liked how the film addresses blood v.s. spirit. The story shows that spirit is thicker than blood. I'm not saying blood relations aren't important but truly precious souls are able to see and walk beyond kin or race parameters. Despite his gruff exterior, Kowalski is such a soul, which explains why he is able to BE Thao's spiritual father and friend. Blood doesn't prevent him from discerning his grandaughter as the spoiled brat she is and seeing Thao's humility and goodness despite his mistakes.There are many other important themes -- love, courage, sacrifice and redemption.Lastly, ""Gran Torino"" addresses some of the same issues as ""Crash"" but does it more effectively, not to mention humorously.PERSONAL GRADE: A",5,"""Dirty Harry 6: The Golden Years""",1232064000,"01 16, 2009",2009,3367,"['ripped-off', 'title', 'blurb', 'reviewer', 'Monkdude', 'such', 'apt', 'description', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist.Clint', 'Eastwood', 'stars', 'Korean', 'War', 'veteran', 'retired', 'automaker', 'Walt', 'Kowalski', 'still', 'living', 'old', 'Michigan', 'neighborhood', 'falling', 'apart', 'late', 'grandfather', 'New', 'Haven', 'Kowalski', 'wife', 'just', 'passed', 'away', 'as', 'cantankerous', 'ever', 'scowling', 'growling', 'everyone', 'everything', 'including', 'Hmong', 'neighbors', 'who', 'hail', 'Laos', 'Something', 'relations', 'family', 'slowly', 'closer', 'own', 'kids', 'grandchildren', 'naturally', 'father-figure', 'role', 'two', 'Hmong', 'teens', 'particular', 'mentoring', 'Thao', 'Bee', 'Vang', 'how', 'be', 'manly', 'productive', 'Unfortunately', 'brutal', 'Asian', 'gang', 'teens', 'serious', 'tensions', 'rise', 'showdown', 'can', 'imagine', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'role', 'Asian', 'mentor', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'teen', 'Asian', 'instead', 'white', ""'d"", 'have', 'pretty', 'good', 'idea', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'violence', 'darker', 'profuse', 'cussing', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'greatly', 'entertaining', 'runtime', 'serious', 'drama', 'also', 'consistently', 'hilarious', 'being', 'comedy', 'sense.Some', 'describe', 'Walt', 'Kowalski', 'Eastwood', 'racist', ""n't"", 'really', 'so', 'many', 'racist', 'remarks', 'film', 'are', 'dispersed', 'evenhanded', 'board', 'recipients', 'are', 'white', 'Asian', 'Black', 'Hispanic', 'think', ""'re"", 'human', 'beings', 'have', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'potential', 'good', 'bad', 'regardless', 'race', 'sharp', 'remarks', 'are', 'simply', 'way', 'breaking', 'ice', 'people', 'relating', 'out', 'also', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'right', 'just', 'way', 'fact', ""n't"", 'really', 'racist', 'proven', 'close', 'relationship', 'Hmong', 'neighbors', 'closer', 'own', 'flesh', 'blood', 'Would', 'real', 'racist', 'be', 'open', 'relationship', 'lot', 'themes', 'are', 'addressed', 'including', 'second', 'chances', 'never', 'too', 'late', 'make', 'up', 'past', 'mistakes', 'even', ""'re"", 'almost', '80', 'years', 'old', 'Walt', 'obviously', 'failed', 'develop', 'close', 'relationships', 'two', 'sons', 'new', 'son', 'thrown', 'lap', 'gift', 'time', 'intent', 'doing', 'right.I', 'liked', 'way', 'generation', 'gap', 'blown', 'smithereens', 'story', 'Walt', 'Thao', 'are', ""n't"", 'just', 'father/son', 'figures', ""'re"", 'friends', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'God', 'Moses', 'Exodus', '33:11', 'Jesus', 'friends', 'John', '15:14-15', 'digress.I', 'also', 'liked', 'how', 'film', 'blood', 'v.s', 'spirit', 'story', 'spirit', 'thicker', 'blood', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'blood', 'relations', 'are', ""n't"", 'important', 'truly', 'precious', 'souls', 'are', 'able', 'see', 'walk', 'kin', 'race', 'parameters', 'gruff', 'exterior', 'Kowalski', 'such', 'soul', 'why', 'able', 'BE', 'Thao', 'spiritual', 'father', 'friend', 'Blood', ""n't"", 'prevent', 'discerning', 'grandaughter', 'spoiled', 'brat', 'seeing', 'Thao', 'humility', 'goodness', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'important', 'themes', 'love', 'courage', 'sacrifice', 'redemption.Lastly', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'same', 'issues', 'Crash', 'more', 'effectively', 'not', 'mention', 'humorously.PERSONAL', 'GRADE', 'A']",Gran Torino
1209252,AP3B615GM191G,B001KVZ6ES,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[4, 6]","I think that anyone who has ever seen a Clint Eastwood film would agree that he is a terrific actor.  Whether as a lone cowboy (The Man With No Name Trilogy), a gritty cop (Dirty Harry), or a boxing manager (Million Dollar Baby), Eastwood is able to provide just the right emotions and actions for the part.However, just as important as his acting is the way he progresses his characters in each film he makes.  Unlike, say, Sylvester Stallone, who tries to play Rocky Balboa and John Rambo at 60 years old, Eastwood takes on roles suitable for a man his age (78).  That is the reason why Gran Torino is such a great film.As the movie begins, Eastwood's character--Walt--is a man who no longer fits into today's world.  Being a veteran of the Korean War and a longtime employee at a Ford Motor plant, Walt is a throwback to a different generation.  Thus, when a Hmong family moves in next door to him and a gang of young Mexicans begin terrorizing the neighborhood, Walt withdraws even further into the shell of his past (as we all fear what we do not understand).  The only time we ever see him happy during the film is while swapping old war stories and tell racist jokes with his old pals down at the local bar.  Otherwise, he just bickers with or downright insults everyone else around him, whether it be his Catholic priest, his new neighbors, or even his own family.Due to a completely uncontrollable set of circumstances, however, Walt is drawn into the conflict between the Hmong and Mexican cultures.  At first, he resists all attempts to lend a helping hand or accept a little bit of gratitude, but eventually he begins to form some friendships.  As the film builds towards and finally reaches its climax, Walt finally begins to understand that the conflicts of today's world are really not that much different those played out on the killing fields of Korea.  They may even require the supreme sacrifice in order to make things right.So, while advertised as a story about a Dirty Harry-type character (""Get off my lawn""), this film is really about so much more.  In typical Eastwood fashion, not only does he deliver a spot-on acting performance filled with his usual grit balanced by some dry humor, but he also advances the ""aura"" of his filmography in a way that no other current Hollywood star can match.  Suffice it to say that no chronological context is ever needed for an Eastwood film...he is who he is.Thus, I recommend this film to pretty much everyone (although be warned that the high use of profanity may rule out the tweens).  Relative youngsters (those not yet old enough to get the Senior Citizens discount) will likely enjoy the film because they will be able to better understand the actions/attitudes of their own parent/grandparent.  Seniors will obviously be intrigued as the story is told from ""their"" point of view and Walt struggles with the same emotions they themselves may be grappling with.Of course, also in typical Eastwood fashion, so many other themes are hinted at during the film that one could write a review about completely different subject matter and still be spot-on in their analysis.  I can't say for certain that Gran Torino deserved an Oscar nomination in any category (as I haven't seen its competition), but those would have to be some spectacular films to beat this masterpiece.",5,Finding His Place In Today's World,1232841600,"01 25, 2009",2009,3337,"['think', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'seen', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'film', 'would', 'agree', 'terrific', 'actor', 'lone', 'cowboy', 'Man', 'Name', 'Trilogy', 'gritty', 'cop', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'boxing', 'manager', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'Eastwood', 'able', 'provide', 'just', 'right', 'emotions', 'actions', 'part.However', 'just', 'as', 'important', 'acting', 'way', 'characters', 'film', 'say', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'who', 'play', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'John', 'Rambo', '60', 'years', 'old', 'Eastwood', 'roles', 'suitable', 'man', 'age', '78', 'reason', 'why', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'such', 'great', 'film.As', 'movie', 'Eastwood', 'character', 'Walt', 'man', 'who', 'no', 'longer', 'today', 'world', 'Being', 'veteran', 'Korean', 'War', 'longtime', 'employee', 'Ford', 'Motor', 'plant', 'Walt', 'throwback', 'different', 'generation', 'Thus', 'when', 'Hmong', 'family', 'moves', 'next', 'door', 'gang', 'young', 'Mexicans', 'begin', 'terrorizing', 'neighborhood', 'Walt', 'withdraws', 'even', 'further', 'shell', 'past', 'fear', 'what', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'only', 'time', 'ever', 'see', 'happy', 'film', 'swapping', 'old', 'war', 'stories', 'tell', 'racist', 'jokes', 'old', 'pals', 'down', 'local', 'bar', 'Otherwise', 'just', 'bickers', 'downright', 'insults', 'everyone', 'else', 'be', 'Catholic', 'priest', 'new', 'neighbors', 'even', 'own', 'family.Due', 'completely', 'uncontrollable', 'set', 'circumstances', 'however', 'Walt', 'drawn', 'conflict', 'Hmong', 'Mexican', 'cultures', 'first', 'attempts', 'lend', 'helping', 'hand', 'accept', 'little', 'bit', 'gratitude', 'eventually', 'form', 'friendships', 'film', 'towards', 'finally', 'climax', 'Walt', 'finally', 'understand', 'conflicts', 'today', 'world', 'are', 'really', 'not', 'much', 'different', 'played', 'out', 'killing', 'fields', 'Korea', 'may', 'even', 'require', 'supreme', 'sacrifice', 'order', 'make', 'things', 'right.So', 'advertised', 'story', 'Dirty', 'Harry-type', 'character', 'Get', 'off', 'lawn', 'film', 'really', 'about', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'typical', 'Eastwood', 'fashion', 'not', 'only', 'deliver', 'spot-on', 'acting', 'performance', 'filled', 'usual', 'grit', 'balanced', 'dry', 'humor', 'also', 'aura', 'filmography', 'way', 'other', 'current', 'Hollywood', 'star', 'can', 'match', 'Suffice', 'say', 'chronological', 'context', 'ever', 'needed', 'Eastwood', 'film', 'who', 'is.Thus', 'recommend', 'film', 'pretty', 'much', 'everyone', 'be', 'warned', 'high', 'use', 'profanity', 'may', 'rule', 'tweens', 'Relative', 'youngsters', 'not', 'yet', 'old', 'enough', 'get', 'Senior', 'Citizens', 'discount', 'will', 'likely', 'enjoy', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'better', 'understand', 'actions/attitudes', 'own', 'parent/grandparent', 'Seniors', 'will', 'obviously', 'be', 'intrigued', 'story', 'told', 'point', 'view', 'Walt', 'same', 'emotions', 'may', 'be', 'grappling', 'with.Of', 'course', 'also', 'typical', 'Eastwood', 'fashion', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'themes', 'are', 'hinted', 'film', 'one', 'could', 'write', 'review', 'completely', 'different', 'subject', 'matter', 'still', 'be', 'spot-on', 'analysis', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'certain', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'category', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'competition', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'spectacular', 'films', 'beat', 'masterpiece']",Gran Torino
1209253,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B001KVZ6ES,Z Hayes,"[8, 8]","""Gran Torino"" is a gem of a movie that once again affirms Clint Eastwood's brilliant abilities. From beginning till end, I found my attention transfixed on the screen, the story is that compelling.Clint Eastwood plays an aging Korean War vet, Walt Kowalski who has recently been widowed. He seems irascible, perpetually squinting in disapproval, basically a curmudgeon. He does not seem to have a loving relationship with his two grown sons who are both married with families of their own. Walt is also something of a racist, spewing some racial slurs at the Hmong family that has moved next door.Within this setting, Walt's path crosses that of the Hmong family next door with some surprising results - the young Hmong teenager, a boy named Thao [Bee Vang] is an alienated teen who is being pressured by a group of Hmong gang members to join them. Although Thao is disinterested, he is forced by the gang to steal a prized 72' Gran Torino from Kowalski's garage. The attempt fails when Thao is interrupted by Kowalski, and this acts as a catalyst for all the events that follow.The gang members, infuriated by Thao's failure, return to bash him up, but are faced with Kowalski's wrath instead [he just wanted them off his lawn]. Later, Kowalski rescues Thao's sister, Sue [Ahney Her] from being harassed by a group of black guys and she worms her way into Kowalski's good graces, taking all the slurs in her stride and eventually gaining Kowalski's genuine affection. Gradually the Hmongs next door cease to become just another group of ""gooks"" but like a real family to Kowalski, something he has never really had, except with his beloved late wife. But, the Hmong gang refuses to let Thao alone and this sets off a chain of events that truly reveal the depth of Kowalski's bond to the family.There are so many complex themes explored in this movie - aging, loneliness, racism, peer pressure, evil , faith, courage, alienation, and many more. Yet, in Mr Eastwood's capable hands, these myriad themes are all linked together in a seamless fashion, giving viewers a movie with real soul - insightful and deep, and thought-provoking. The climax when it comes, is simply mind-blowing and so very beautifully executed, delivering a powerful message.The movie is definitely carried by Eastwood's portrayal of Kowalski as the old racist war vet who in fact embodies real courage, steely determination and plenty of heart. The actors portraying the Hmong seemed rather stilted in their performances, especially Bee Vang's Thao, though I liked Ahney Her's portrayal of the acerbic and candid Sue. There was also another highlight performance, that of the Catholic priest, Father Janovich [Christopher Carley] who seems initially way out of his depth in trying to get Walt to confession [as per Walt's late wife's wishes], and whose baby-face actually belies a strong character, determined to do the right thing.""Gran Torino"" is a gem of a movie, and is one of those rare dramas of substance that had me pondering about issues long after the credits rolled.",5,Insightful and brilliant,1244851200,"06 13, 2009",2009,3049,"['Gran', 'Torino', 'gem', 'movie', 'once', 'again', 'affirms', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'brilliant', 'abilities', 'beginning', 'till', 'end', 'found', 'attention', 'transfixed', 'screen', 'story', 'compelling.Clint', 'Eastwood', 'aging', 'Korean', 'War', 'vet', 'Walt', 'Kowalski', 'who', 'recently', 'been', 'widowed', 'irascible', 'perpetually', 'squinting', 'disapproval', 'basically', 'curmudgeon', 'not', 'seem', 'have', 'loving', 'relationship', 'two', 'grown', 'sons', 'who', 'are', 'married', 'families', 'own', 'Walt', 'also', 'something', 'racist', 'spewing', 'racial', 'slurs', 'Hmong', 'family', 'moved', 'next', 'door.Within', 'setting', 'Walt', 'path', 'Hmong', 'family', 'next', 'door', 'surprising', 'results', 'young', 'Hmong', 'teenager', 'boy', 'named', 'Thao', '[', 'Bee', 'Vang', ']', 'alienated', 'teen', 'who', 'being', 'pressured', 'group', 'Hmong', 'gang', 'members', 'join', 'Thao', 'disinterested', 'forced', 'gang', 'steal', 'prized', '72', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'Kowalski', 'garage', 'attempt', 'when', 'Thao', 'interrupted', 'Kowalski', 'catalyst', 'events', 'follow.The', 'gang', 'members', 'infuriated', 'Thao', 'failure', 'return', 'bash', 'up', 'are', 'faced', 'Kowalski', 'wrath', 'instead', '[', 'just', 'wanted', 'off', 'lawn', ']', 'Later', 'Kowalski', 'Thao', 'sister', 'Sue', '[', 'Ahney', 'Her', ']', 'being', 'harassed', 'group', 'black', 'guys', 'way', 'Kowalski', 'good', 'graces', 'taking', 'slurs', 'stride', 'eventually', 'gaining', 'Kowalski', 'genuine', 'affection', 'Gradually', 'Hmongs', 'next', 'door', 'cease', 'become', 'just', 'group', 'gooks', 'real', 'family', 'Kowalski', 'something', 'never', 'really', 'had', 'beloved', 'late', 'wife', 'Hmong', 'gang', 'let', 'Thao', 'alone', 'off', 'chain', 'events', 'truly', 'reveal', 'depth', 'Kowalski', 'bond', 'family.There', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'complex', 'themes', 'explored', 'movie', 'aging', 'loneliness', 'racism', 'peer', 'pressure', 'evil', 'faith', 'courage', 'alienation', 'many', 'more', 'Mr', 'Eastwood', 'capable', 'hands', 'myriad', 'themes', 'are', 'linked', 'together', 'seamless', 'fashion', 'giving', 'viewers', 'movie', 'real', 'soul', 'insightful', 'deep', 'thought-provoking', 'climax', 'when', 'simply', 'mind-blowing', 'so', 'very', 'beautifully', 'executed', 'delivering', 'powerful', 'message.The', 'movie', 'definitely', 'carried', 'Eastwood', 'portrayal', 'Kowalski', 'old', 'racist', 'war', 'vet', 'who', 'fact', 'embodies', 'real', 'courage', 'steely', 'determination', 'plenty', 'heart', 'actors', 'portraying', 'Hmong', 'seemed', 'rather', 'stilted', 'performances', 'especially', 'Bee', 'Vang', 'Thao', 'liked', 'Ahney', 'Her', 'portrayal', 'acerbic', 'candid', 'Sue', 'was', 'also', 'highlight', 'performance', 'Catholic', 'priest', 'Father', 'Janovich', '[', 'Christopher', 'Carley', ']', 'who', 'initially', 'way', 'depth', 'trying', 'get', 'Walt', 'confession', '[', 'Walt', 'late', 'wife', 'wishes', ']', 'baby-face', 'actually', 'strong', 'character', 'determined', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'gem', 'movie', 'one', 'rare', 'dramas', 'substance', 'had', 'pondering', 'issues', 'long', 'credits', 'rolled']",Gran Torino
