The first half of the movie moves along nicely but the second half starts out slow with some character development that fizzles.  I think a lot of fans would have preferred that this dull time be replaced with individual pinball displays of some sort.  Needed more info about the games than the players.  The movie then recovers nicely for the remainder of the second half.  Overall, a nice documentary that any pinballer -- which seems to be less and less of every day -- would enjoy.",4,Nice but lacks more Game time,1330905600,"03 5, 2012",2012,563,"['Very', 'nice', 'production', 'history', 'current', 'characters', 'pinball', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'along', 'nicely', 'second', 'half', 'out', 'slow', 'character', 'development', 'fizzles', 'think', 'lot', 'fans', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'dull', 'time', 'be', 'replaced', 'individual', 'pinball', 'displays', 'sort', 'Needed', 'more', 'info', 'games', 'players', 'movie', 'then', 'nicely', 'remainder', 'second', 'half', 'Overall', 'nice', 'documentary', 'pinballer', 'be', 'less', 'less', 'day', 'would', 'enjoy']",N/A
1406480,A3JZOITOIP90EW,B004G6P5VI,Cass G,"[0, 0]","This is a great documentary, it takes you through the history of pinball to the modern collectors and competition players, it is funny, informative, and interesting, whether you're a pinball enthusiast or not, the second half of the doc is basically the spot on equivalent of The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters but for pinball, if you liked that you should like this, these so called ""professional pinball players"" are every bit as quirky as the ""professional Donky Kong players"" and appear to get laid even less, I agree with the other reviewer that said they should've included more actual game and competition play and see the ball bounce around a bit more, to really see what makes the competition players so much better then you or I, but they do show them jumping around at machines quite a bit which may well have been more entertaining. I can also see how another reviewer here may have been frustrated with this film for not focusing on more ""normal"" pinball enthusiasts instead of focusing on more quirky or ""fringe"" people, but lets face it then it would've just been a boring history lesson, not nearly as entertaining and fun, and in all fairness, they do speak with and interview a huge spectrum of people from designers, manufacturers, arcade owners, collectors, and players from all over the world, the quirky people are just the most memorable.",4,Great Pinball Documentary,1330992000,"03 6, 2012",2012,1366,"['great', 'documentary', 'history', 'pinball', 'modern', 'collectors', 'competition', 'players', 'funny', 'informative', 'interesting', ""'re"", 'pinball', 'enthusiast', 'not', 'second', 'half', 'doc', 'basically', 'spot', 'equivalent', 'King', 'Kong', 'Fistful', 'Quarters', 'pinball', 'liked', 'should', 'like', 'so', 'called', 'professional', 'pinball', 'players', 'are', 'bit', 'as', 'quirky', 'professional', 'Donky', 'Kong', 'players', 'appear', 'get', 'laid', 'even', 'less', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewer', 'said', 'should', ""'ve"", 'included', 'more', 'actual', 'game', 'competition', 'play', 'see', 'ball', 'bounce', 'bit', 'more', 'really', 'see', 'what', 'competition', 'players', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'then', 'do', 'show', 'jumping', 'around', 'machines', 'quite', 'bit', 'may', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'entertaining', 'can', 'also', 'see', 'how', 'reviewer', 'here', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'frustrated', 'film', 'not', 'focusing', 'more', 'normal', 'pinball', 'instead', 'focusing', 'more', 'quirky', 'fringe', 'people', 'face', 'then', 'would', ""'ve"", 'just', 'been', 'boring', 'history', 'lesson', 'not', 'nearly', 'entertaining', 'fun', 'fairness', 'do', 'speak', 'interview', 'huge', 'spectrum', 'people', 'designers', 'manufacturers', 'arcade', 'owners', 'collectors', 'players', 'world', 'quirky', 'people', 'are', 'just', 'most', 'memorable']",N/A

I've watched all of the available pinball documentaries including Tilt and Pinball Passion to date but this one is leaps and bounds over the others with a focus on interesting characters in the hobby and dazzling graphical effects that bring playfields, schematics, and backglasses to life in this great film.The interjection of the historical information about the hobby along with competition and collector focus pieces kept the DVD moving at a great pace.  Some might take offense with the weird characters chosen to interview but it really does give some great insight into the obsession that comes with being a collector in this hobby!!Fantastic job on this DVD.

It provides some history of the machines and how they evolved, but it also shows pinball players doing ""yoga,"" talking about the game, collecting machines, competing, and so on. The movie also shows (much as Trekkies does) that it's possible to become overly obsessive about ANYTHING. If there is a weakness to the movie, then it is the amount of time it spends interviewing some of the ""characters"" involved with pinball.The graphics and production values used in the film are great.

1406483,AB53UWILW4F8R,B004G6P5VI,J. Johnson,"[2, 4]","""Special When Lit"" is a great movie about pinball that is colorful, entertaining, wonderfully shot and edited. You can watch it with someone that knows nothing about pinball and they will be entertained. It was fun for me to point out the pinball machines that I had played. It's a trip back in time, mostly to the 70s, and a great fast paced look at the history of pinball.If you are a Pinball Wizard you will really appreciate the dedication of all the pinball players and collectors in the movie. If you are not a pinball fan you will think those same people are pathetic losers. This movie reminds me of a joke that goes something like this: There was a handsome prince that asked a beautiful princess to marry him one day. She said ""No"" and the prince lived happily ever after because he had money to go and play pinball all day.The people that made this movie have a great knowledge of the product as well as an outstanding sense of humor. Comedy is timing/editing and this movie understands that perfectly! This movie is not a comedy. It's a serious historical piece with some great comedic elements. You can't make these uber pinball machine collector characters up! You will laugh out loud.This is a movie primarly made for pinball enthusiasts and that's a really small group of older people today as you can see in the movie but it's a great movie for all ages. Use it as a visual aid to explain to your video gamers about the evolution of pool halls, video arcades and the home video game systems.",5,Special When Lit a.k.a.

Did you know that the addition of flippers in 1947 changed the pinball game from a game of chance to a game of skill?  Did you know that there is only one pinball machine company today?  Did you know that there is a world championship of pinball? It is all included in this most enjoyable presentation on pinball.

1406486,AP3B615GM191G,B004G6P5VI,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","As a child, my grandparents had a ""Captain Fantastic & The Brown Dirt Cowboy"" pinball machine in their basement.  I had a lot of fun times playing that machine, but never really appreciated it until it broke down and eventually was not able to be repaired.  I hadn't thought about those experiences for quite awhile until stumbling upon this nostalgic little documentary on Netflix.  Boy, did the memories ever come flowing back!This documentary takes two distinct tacts in discussing pinball: First, it gives a history of the game, which I found to be very fascinating.  Second, it focuses on the pinball players themselves, which is where the doc dragged and couldn't nearly live up to the drama of, say, ""King of Kong"".Though not around in the heyday of pinball (1970s-early 80s), that machine in the basement provided me with some pinball memories, something I cannot say for my younger siblings or the younger generation as a whole.  That is why this documentary appealed to me so much.  Without any prior pinball experiences, viewers will find this doc to be just a collection of nerds with no life.  For those that have experienced the thrill of pinball, however, it is much more personal.Overall, this is a better-than-average documentary on a niche subject.  I suspect the viewership demographic to be very slim, but those who ""get it"" (like myself) will find it to be a fascinating, highly nostalgic subject.",4,A Wave Of Nostalgia,1321315200,"11 15, 2011",2011,1418,"['child', 'grandparents', 'had', 'Captain', 'Fantastic', 'Brown', 'Dirt', 'Cowboy', 'pinball', 'machine', 'basement', 'had', 'lot', 'fun', 'times', 'playing', 'machine', 'never', 'really', 'appreciated', 'broke', 'down', 'eventually', 'was', 'not', 'able', 'be', 'repaired', 'had', ""n't"", 'thought', 'experiences', 'quite', 'awhile', 'stumbling', 'nostalgic', 'little', 'documentary', 'Netflix', 'Boy', 'did', 'memories', 'ever', 'come', 'flowing', 'back', 'documentary', 'two', 'distinct', 'tacts', 'discussing', 'pinball', 'First', 'history', 'game', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'fascinating', 'Second', 'pinball', 'players', 'where', 'doc', 'dragged', 'could', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'live', 'up', 'drama', 'say', 'King', 'Kong', 'not', 'heyday', 'pinball', '1970s-early', '80s', 'machine', 'basement', 'provided', 'pinball', 'memories', 'something', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'younger', 'siblings', 'younger', 'generation', 'whole', 'why', 'documentary', 'appealed', 'so', 'much', 'prior', 'pinball', 'experiences', 'viewers', 'will', 'find', 'doc', 'be', 'just', 'collection', 'nerds', 'life', 'have', 'experienced', 'thrill', 'pinball', 'however', 'much', 'more', 'personal.Overall', 'better-than-average', 'documentary', 'niche', 'subject', 'suspect', 'viewership', 'demographic', 'be', 'very', 'slim', 'who', 'get', 'will', 'find', 'be', 'fascinating', 'highly', 'nostalgic', 'subject']",N/A
