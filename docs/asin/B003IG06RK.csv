KIROT fits better in the thriller/drama section and that makes the film so compelling. It is a serious and very touching movie about forced prostitution and abuse.Both stars of this picture, Olga Kurylenko and Ninet Tayeb deliver outstanding performances (it is a pity that Kurylenko hasn't been offered better roles in the US, but that should change after this).All in all I can only STRONGLY RECOMMEND this movie!!",5,BEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR,1297987200,"02 18, 2011",2011,616,"['shame', 'took', 'so', 'long', 'THE', 'ASSASSIN', 'NEXT', 'DOOR', 'KIROT', 'be', 'released', 'far', 'best', 'movie', 'year.Anyone', 'expecting', 'action-packed', 'shoot', 'up', 'might', 'be', 'disappointed', 'KIROT', 'better', 'thriller/drama', 'section', 'film', 'so', 'compelling', 'serious', 'very', 'touching', 'movie', 'forced', 'prostitution', 'stars', 'picture', 'Olga', 'Kurylenko', 'Ninet', 'Tayeb', 'deliver', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'pity', 'Kurylenko', ""n't"", 'been', 'offered', 'better', 'roles', 'US', 'should', 'change', '.All', 'can', 'only', 'STRONGLY', 'RECOMMEND', 'movie']",N/A

1346269,A2NJ0FN87IN3CL,B003IG06RK,CRAB,"[17, 22]","I watched this movie just on the fact that Olga Kurylenko was in it. I first saw her acting in The Hitman & was very impressed with her exotic beauty, expressive eyes & defiant spirit yet displaying vulnerabilty. Her character in Assassin displays very similar characteristics, which works even better in this movie. Other reviewers have already outlined the plot, so I won't go there. This movie has a bit of everything and thats what makes it so good. It has beautiful women that can think & are independent, it has an emotional content that will touch you, great action, a good story line, great music & symbolisms. Olga has very expressive and penetrative eyes which was apparent in The Hitman. She can portray great information & emotion just using her eyes and expressions on her face. She has a very natural presence in front of the camera and therefore very convincing in her role. She was greatly under used in the Quantum Solace & therefore if you saw that movie do not use that to judge her abilities. I think she has all the qualities if she is properly developed and marketed to be one of the best actresses I have ever seen. She is the full package of looks & talent. She can be cute & playful, yet strong and serious as a heart attack.

1346270,ADKZOXAOV8EXD,B003IG06RK,Doctor.Generosity,"[2, 6]","This is a gritty Israeli movie set in the Tel Aviv underworld of prostitution and organized crime. There are some good ingredients in the film; the two women leads are hard working actresses, although Olga is rather wooden. The dark moody scenes of Tel Aviv noir are well photographed.Unfortunately what director Danny Lerner does with these potentials is crude. The film is packed with ugly gratuitous violence from frame one. The first scene is an extremely graphic, bloody beating of two beautiful Eastern European prostitutes which ends with the knife murder of one, shown in fine detail - closeups of the knife, the sound of it entering her abdomen, the gasps she makes, etc. The other woman, after many further kicks, slaps, punches, blood, and abuse, is forced to assassinate victims designated by the mob. Not very believable. Then the film goes on to render various shootings, at least a dozen. Most of this violence is not really necessary to the story line, and it became difficult to watch. The supposed theme of the movie - women trapped in criminal activity or abusive marriages - could have made a compelling drama, but Lerner dissipates it in an orgy of violence-porn. The director is himself clearly a pervert who revels in this stuff. I suspect he also has in mind building his resume so he can go to Hollywood and make bigger-budget versions where he can fantasize abusing ever more expensive and famous actresses - Angelina Jolie?In the meantime, some of the events portrayed here are so stupid as to be laughable. The Israeli co-star, who states she's been in the army, nevertheless claims not to know how to fire a gun and asks for lessons. Really? Audiences in Israel must have hooted at that one. And although hundreds of loud gunshots are fired in the heart of the city throughout the film, there never once appears a single cop or emergency responder. This in Tel Aviv, the city in the world most on alert? Then we have the depiction of the Jewish observance of the mikvah (ritual bath), about which Danny Lerner appears to have only the sketchiest understanding (the woman attendents are dressed like Catholic nuns). Finally we have the dream sequences of Olga drifting through a cornfield with her faraway little daughter or floating underwater - laughably amateurish. Would get a C- in first semester film school.This is the second movie written and directed by Lerner. He scores a coup by recruiting Olga Kurylenko, who starred in the last James Bond movie. But the result is cynical, straight-to-video exploitation. Lerner presents this film as if championing women freeing themselves from abuse, while in actuality he himself is eroticizing violence against them.",2,Thinly disguised violence-porn,1319068800,"10 20, 2011",2011,2695,"['gritty', 'Israeli', 'movie', 'set', 'Tel', 'Aviv', 'underworld', 'prostitution', 'organized', 'crime', 'are', 'good', 'ingredients', 'film', 'two', 'women', 'leads', 'are', 'hard', 'working', 'actresses', 'Olga', 'rather', 'wooden', 'dark', 'moody', 'scenes', 'Tel', 'Aviv', 'noir', 'are', 'well', 'photographed.Unfortunately', 'what', 'director', 'Danny', 'Lerner', 'potentials', 'crude', 'film', 'packed', 'ugly', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'frame', 'one', 'first', 'scene', 'extremely', 'graphic', 'bloody', 'beating', 'two', 'beautiful', 'Eastern', 'European', 'prostitutes', 'knife', 'murder', 'one', 'shown', 'fine', 'detail', 'closeups', 'knife', 'sound', 'entering', 'abdomen', 'gasps', 'etc', 'other', 'woman', 'many', 'further', 'kicks', 'slaps', 'punches', 'blood', 'abuse', 'forced', 'assassinate', 'victims', 'designated', 'mob', 'Not', 'very', 'believable', 'Then', 'film', 'render', 'various', 'shootings', 'least', 'dozen', 'Most', 'violence', 'not', 'really', 'necessary', 'story', 'line', 'became', 'difficult', 'watch', 'supposed', 'theme', 'movie', 'women', 'trapped', 'criminal', 'activity', 'abusive', 'marriages', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'compelling', 'drama', 'Lerner', 'orgy', 'violence-porn', 'director', 'clearly', 'pervert', 'who', 'stuff', 'suspect', 'also', 'mind', 'building', 'resume', 'can', 'go', 'Hollywood', 'make', 'bigger-budget', 'versions', 'where', 'can', 'fantasize', 'abusing', 'ever', 'more', 'expensive', 'famous', 'actresses', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'meantime', 'events', 'portrayed', 'here', 'are', 'so', 'stupid', 'be', 'laughable', 'Israeli', 'co-star', 'who', 'been', 'army', 'nevertheless', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'fire', 'gun', 'asks', 'lessons', 'Really', 'Audiences', 'Israel', 'must', 'have', 'hooted', 'one', 'hundreds', 'loud', 'gunshots', 'are', 'fired', 'heart', 'city', 'film', 'never', 'once', 'single', 'cop', 'emergency', 'responder', 'Tel', 'Aviv', 'city', 'world', 'most', 'alert', 'Then', 'have', 'depiction', 'Jewish', 'observance', 'mikvah', 'ritual', 'bath', 'about', 'Danny', 'Lerner', 'have', 'only', 'sketchiest', 'understanding', 'woman', 'attendents', 'are', 'dressed', 'Catholic', 'nuns', 'Finally', 'have', 'dream', 'sequences', 'Olga', 'drifting', 'cornfield', 'faraway', 'little', 'daughter', 'floating', 'underwater', 'laughably', 'amateurish', 'Would', 'get', 'C-', 'first', 'semester', 'film', 'school.This', 'second', 'movie', 'written', 'directed', 'Lerner', 'coup', 'recruiting', 'Olga', 'Kurylenko', 'who', 'starred', 'last', 'James', 'Bond', 'movie', 'result', 'cynical', 'straight-to-video', 'exploitation', 'Lerner', 'film', 'championing', 'women', 'freeing', 'abuse', 'actuality', 'eroticizing', 'violence']",N/A

1346272,A3D6OI36USYOU1,B003IG06RK,Ghenghis,"[0, 0]","OK I'm a big fan of Olga Kurylenko.  I liked her in Paris Je T'aime and Centurion.  When I came across TheAssassin Next Door and saw her name in the credits, I paid attention to the synopsis, which sounded intriguing.It was not executed nearly as well as it sounded.Galia (Kurylenko) is a prostitute.  The film opens on a close up of her face.  She is sitting in a club with anotherprostitute.  It becomes clear that they are not willing participants when they are ordered to smile at the customers.Shortly thereafter, the two bolt for a locked door that has been temporarily opened.  Predictably, the other prostituteends up dead, but Galia is given a proposition to become a hitter for the mob in exchange for her former profession.Reluctantly she takes the deal.As we pick up the back story, Galia left Ukraine, her husband and a disabled daughter for Israel, where she is presentlytrying to work off her debt to earn back her passport and money.  Galia continues to kill, but never seems to get anycloser to her trip home.  She is set up in an apartment, where she developes a close relationship with her neighbor Elinor(Ninette Tayeb) who is a victim of domestic abuse.  The two make plans to leave Tel Aviv for a remote town to start over,but the mob stands in their way.The Assassin Next Door has a choppy storyline that bounces through time with very little indication of elapsed time.The changes are forced on the viewer indelicately, leaving the audience feeling cheated and, at times, confused.  Thetransitions could have been much smoother.  The story itself is a little far fetched but if you're a fan of Russian mobmovies like me you've seen this plot line before. But the transition requires an explanation, and in this story, we don'tget an adequate one.  The characters are pretty flat, to include the main character Galia.  Although there are attempts todevelop her character, they are fairly superficial.  The film becomes predictable.  The action sequences are the only partof the film that make it worthwhile, and they are few and far between.Kurylenko did fine in her role, but a lot of the scenes didn't make sense and that hurt her performance.  It is hard to knowwhere she is going with the role sometimes because events sort of happen without much transition or groundwork.  Kurylenkoappeared to give the best she could, but anyone who hasn't seen her before will probably consider her performance average.This can be said for the rest of the cast as well.  The bad guys are typical flat unexciting bad guys and the good guys arerather boring.  The cast had little to work with and didn't do much to overcome their restrictions.The Assassin Next Door was rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America.  The film had adult undertones throughout thefilm, from the sex-slave trade to the hitman angle.  Although violent at times, the nudity was brief (and unrewarding). It seemedthat the rating was geared more towards the themes in the film considering the rest of the material was rather tame and filledwith English subtitles.I was hoping for good things from this flick, but I was sorely disappointed.  The writing was horrid.  Director Danny Lerner haswritten and directed one film prior to this (Frozen Days) which appears to have done better than this one.  The jerky transitionsbetween scenes, poor character development and weak foundational writing left this script with very little to offer.  Kurylenko wasappealing, but her character never really touched me.  The chain of event seemed implausible, which was made worse by those itemsjust mentioned.  The actual cinematography was decent and the film had a nice visual appeal, but those (and Olga) were about theonly redeeming qualities for me.  3 stars, only because I have a thing for Olga, you may not.",3,Olga....oh my!,1391731200,"02 7, 2014",2014,3796,"['OK', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'Olga', 'Kurylenko', 'liked', 'Paris', 'Je', ""T'aime"", 'Centurion', 'When', 'came', 'TheAssassin', 'Next', 'Door', 'saw', 'name', 'credits', 'paid', 'attention', 'synopsis', 'sounded', 'intriguing.It', 'was', 'not', 'executed', 'nearly', 'as', 'well', 'Kurylenko', 'prostitute', 'film', 'close', 'face', 'sitting', 'club', 'anotherprostitute', 'clear', 'are', 'not', 'willing', 'participants', 'when', 'are', 'ordered', 'smile', 'customers.Shortly', 'thereafter', 'two', 'bolt', 'locked', 'door', 'been', 'temporarily', 'opened', 'Predictably', 'other', 'up', 'dead', 'Galia', 'given', 'proposition', 'become', 'hitter', 'mob', 'exchange', 'former', 'profession.Reluctantly', 'deal.As', 'pick', 'up', 'back', 'story', 'Galia', 'left', 'Ukraine', 'husband', 'disabled', 'daughter', 'Israel', 'where', 'presentlytrying', 'work', 'off', 'debt', 'earn', 'back', 'passport', 'money', 'Galia', 'kill', 'never', 'get', 'anycloser', 'trip', 'home', 'set', 'up', 'apartment', 'where', 'close', 'relationship', 'neighbor', 'Elinor', 'Ninette', 'Tayeb', 'who', 'victim', 'domestic', 'abuse', 'two', 'make', 'plans', 'leave', 'Tel', 'Aviv', 'remote', 'town', 'start', 'mob', 'way.The', 'Assassin', 'Next', 'Door', 'choppy', 'storyline', 'time', 'very', 'little', 'indication', 'elapsed', 'time.The', 'changes', 'are', 'forced', 'viewer', 'indelicately', 'leaving', 'audience', 'feeling', 'cheated', 'times', 'confused', 'Thetransitions', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'smoother', 'story', 'little', 'far', 'fetched', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Russian', 'mobmovies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'plot', 'line', 'transition', 'explanation', 'story', ""don'tget"", 'adequate', 'one', 'characters', 'are', 'pretty', 'flat', 'include', 'main', 'character', 'Galia', 'are', 'attempts', 'character', 'are', 'fairly', 'superficial', 'film', 'predictable', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'only', 'film', 'make', 'worthwhile', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'between.Kurylenko', 'did', 'fine', 'role', 'lot', 'scenes', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'hurt', 'performance', 'hard', 'knowwhere', 'going', 'role', 'sometimes', 'events', 'sort', 'happen', 'much', 'transition', 'groundwork', 'Kurylenkoappeared', 'give', 'best', 'could', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'will', 'probably', 'consider', 'performance', 'average.This', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'rest', 'cast', 'as', 'well', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'typical', 'flat', 'unexciting', 'bad', 'guys', 'good', 'guys', 'arerather', 'boring', 'cast', 'had', 'little', 'work', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'overcome', 'restrictions.The', 'Assassin', 'Next', 'Door', 'was', 'rated', 'R', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'Association', 'America', 'film', 'had', 'adult', 'undertones', 'thefilm', 'sex-slave', 'trade', 'hitman', 'angle', 'violent', 'times', 'nudity', 'was', 'brief', 'unrewarding', 'seemedthat', 'rating', 'was', 'geared', 'more', 'themes', 'film', 'considering', 'rest', 'material', 'was', 'rather', 'tame', 'filledwith', 'English', 'subtitles.I', 'was', 'hoping', 'good', 'things', 'flick', 'was', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'writing', 'was', 'horrid', 'Director', 'Danny', 'Lerner', 'haswritten', 'directed', 'one', 'film', 'prior', 'Frozen', 'Days', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'one', 'jerky', 'transitionsbetween', 'scenes', 'poor', 'character', 'development', 'weak', 'foundational', 'writing', 'left', 'script', 'very', 'little', 'offer', 'Kurylenko', 'wasappealing', 'character', 'never', 'really', 'touched', 'chain', 'event', 'seemed', 'implausible', 'was', 'made', 'worse', 'itemsjust', 'mentioned', 'actual', 'cinematography', 'was', 'decent', 'film', 'had', 'nice', 'visual', 'appeal', 'Olga', 'were', 'theonly', 'redeeming', 'qualities', '3', 'stars', 'only', 'have', 'thing', 'Olga', 'may', 'not']",N/A

1346286,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B003IG06RK,trebe,"[1, 2]","The crime drama The Assassin Next Door (2009), combines crime and gritty violence, with friendship and the desire for freedom, into a fairly interesting although somewhat uneven story, that attempts to excite, and thrill, while also touching the heart.  The movie has some well executed action scenes, and poignant emotional moments, but the overall story has a few rough spots.  Major spoilers follow.Olga Kurylenko (Quantum of Solace]) plays Galia, a Ukrainian working in America for the Russian mob as an escort.  She and a co-worker attempt to escape from their masters, but are recaptured, and brutally beaten.  The other woman is murdered, but Galia pleads with her gangster boss Mishka for a chance at freedom, and surprisingly her wish is granted.  In return for shooting someone, she will be freed from the sex trade.Galia dreams of going back to Ukraine, to be with her young daughter.  Faced with a tough choice, a terrified Galia completes her first assignment, and in return is allowed to live in a shabby apartment.  She is occasionally called on to eliminate a target, but otherwise, her time is mostly her own.  Galia discovers that her neighbor Eleanor (Ninette Tayeb), a clerk at a market, is being abused by her husband, and the women form a friendship borne from a common language (Hebrew) and their mutual hardships.  Matters eventually reach a critical point, as each of them attempt to escape from their respective nightmares, leading to an explosion of violence.Despite any language barrier, Olga Kurylenko seems to be a very capable actress.  The special relationship that develops between Eleanor and Galia becomes the heart of the film.  While they have their ups and downs, there are some special and genuinely tender moments.  Tayeb and Kurylenko are terrific in their scenes together, which often feature very natural sounding and thoughtful dialog, usually spoken in broken English.One of the movie's strong points is the exciting and often brutal action scenes, however logic and consistency is an issue.  The brutality and ruthlessness that the film opens with, sets the tone, which is mostly sustained through Galia's first mission, although trusting her with a loaded weapon makes little sense.  After this less than rousing success, matters strangely seem to shift in Galia's favor, as she begins to rebel and make demands, and then is cut a lot of slack, after she fails to complete an assignment.This ""softening"" by the Russian thugs doesn't make much sense, as attempts to disobey are typically crushed mercilessly.  Mishka has no problems with murdering people in public, and has plenty of muscle to accomplish what Galia is reluctant to do, so his waiting around for her to ""get with the program"", seems completely ridiculous.  Galia eventually has the courage to take on the gang, but then returns to the first place they will look for her, where she and Eleanor have to make a bloody escape.  The movie goes way overboard at the finish, but it is a blast watching Galia (who never reloads), battle with great gusto.The Assassin Next Door has a simple and familiar story that has some fantasy aspects, as the abused women struggle to gain their freedom, and a chance at happiness.  Galia is not without sin, but her options are limited.  While there are some issues, the film's solid emotional foundation, good acting performances, and better than average marks in the action department, make this an entertaining thriller, that would be a good addition to your watchlist, particularly for Prime members.",4,"the depth and breadth of Olga Kurylenko's performance, makes this action thriller worth watching...",1342051200,"07 12, 2012",2012,3546,"['crime', 'drama', 'Assassin', 'Next', 'Door', '2009', 'combines', 'crime', 'gritty', 'violence', 'friendship', 'desire', 'freedom', 'fairly', 'interesting', 'somewhat', 'uneven', 'story', 'excite', 'thrill', 'also', 'touching', 'heart', 'movie', 'well', 'executed', 'action', 'scenes', 'poignant', 'emotional', 'moments', 'overall', 'story', 'few', 'rough', 'spots', 'Major', 'spoilers', 'follow.Olga', 'Kurylenko', 'Quantum', 'Solace', ']', 'Galia', 'Ukrainian', 'working', 'America', 'Russian', 'mob', 'escort', 'co-worker', 'attempt', 'escape', 'masters', 'are', 'recaptured', 'brutally', 'beaten', 'other', 'woman', 'murdered', 'Galia', 'gangster', 'boss', 'Mishka', 'chance', 'freedom', 'surprisingly', 'wish', 'granted', 'return', 'shooting', 'someone', 'will', 'be', 'freed', 'sex', 'trade.Galia', 'dreams', 'going', 'back', 'Ukraine', 'be', 'young', 'daughter', 'Faced', 'tough', 'choice', 'terrified', 'Galia', 'first', 'assignment', 'return', 'allowed', 'live', 'shabby', 'apartment', 'occasionally', 'called', 'eliminate', 'target', 'otherwise', 'time', 'mostly', 'own', 'Galia', 'neighbor', 'Eleanor', 'Ninette', 'Tayeb', 'clerk', 'market', 'being', 'abused', 'husband', 'women', 'form', 'friendship', 'borne', 'common', 'language', 'Hebrew', 'mutual', 'hardships', 'Matters', 'eventually', 'reach', 'critical', 'point', 'attempt', 'escape', 'respective', 'nightmares', 'leading', 'explosion', 'violence.Despite', 'language', 'barrier', 'Olga', 'Kurylenko', 'be', 'very', 'capable', 'actress', 'special', 'relationship', 'Eleanor', 'Galia', 'heart', 'film', 'have', 'ups', 'downs', 'are', 'special', 'genuinely', 'tender', 'moments', 'Tayeb', 'Kurylenko', 'are', 'terrific', 'scenes', 'together', 'often', 'feature', 'very', 'natural', 'sounding', 'thoughtful', 'dialog', 'usually', 'spoken', 'broken', 'English.One', 'movie', 'strong', 'points', 'exciting', 'often', 'brutal', 'action', 'scenes', 'however', 'logic', 'consistency', 'issue', 'brutality', 'ruthlessness', 'film', 'tone', 'mostly', 'sustained', 'Galia', 'first', 'mission', 'trusting', 'loaded', 'weapon', 'little', 'sense', 'less', 'rousing', 'success', 'matters', 'strangely', 'seem', 'shift', 'Galia', 'favor', 'rebel', 'make', 'demands', 'then', 'cut', 'lot', 'slack', 'complete', 'assignment.This', 'softening', 'Russian', 'thugs', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'attempts', 'disobey', 'are', 'typically', 'crushed', 'mercilessly', 'Mishka', 'problems', 'murdering', 'people', 'public', 'plenty', 'muscle', 'accomplish', 'what', 'Galia', 'reluctant', 'do', 'waiting', 'around', 'get', 'program', 'completely', 'ridiculous', 'Galia', 'eventually', 'courage', 'take', 'gang', 'then', 'first', 'place', 'will', 'look', 'where', 'Eleanor', 'have', 'make', 'bloody', 'escape', 'movie', 'way', 'overboard', 'finish', 'blast', 'watching', 'Galia', 'who', 'never', 'battle', 'great', 'gusto.The', 'Assassin', 'Next', 'Door', 'simple', 'familiar', 'story', 'fantasy', 'aspects', 'abused', 'women', 'struggle', 'gain', 'freedom', 'chance', 'happiness', 'Galia', 'not', 'sin', 'options', 'are', 'limited', 'are', 'issues', 'film', 'solid', 'emotional', 'foundation', 'good', 'acting', 'performances', 'better', 'average', 'marks', 'action', 'department', 'make', 'entertaining', 'thriller', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'addition', 'watchlist', 'particularly', 'Prime', 'members']",N/A

She is a Ukrainian prostitute-turned-assassin currently living in an old apartment room in Tel Aviv. With her passport confiscated by the gangster who hires her as assassin, she spends her days waiting for the assignments to kill, dreaming of one day meeting her daughter she left in Ukraine again. But her life changes drastically when Galia meets Elinor (Ninet Tayeb), a woman living in a room across the hall, abused by her wife-beating husband.The Israeli-French-US film stars Olga Kurylenko, ""Bond girl"" of ""Quantum of Solace,"" but those who are looking for Hollywood-style ""big"" actions would be disappointed. Obviously director Danny Lerner is less interested in staging shoot-outs and explosions than presenting the gritty atmosphere of the world Galia and Elinor are living. This approach, together with effective photography, brings tension and realism to the film, especially in the description of the friendship between the two exploited women, but we also have to turn a blind eye to the film's incredible storyline and situations (so, where is the police?)""The Assassin Next Door"" has the brooding mood of ""La Femme Nikita,"" but its theme is close to that of ""Thelma & Louise,"" and the film benefits from the strong performances from the two leads.
