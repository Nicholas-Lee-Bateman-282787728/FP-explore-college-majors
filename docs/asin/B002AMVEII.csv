1258816,A2JDYUSI2RILEB,B002AMVEII,Andre Dursin,"[1, 1]","Sleeper hit from 1987 (which earned its share of critical kudos as well) boasts a taut script by novelist Donald E. Westlake and a terrific performance from future ""Lost"" star Terry O'Quinn as an unhinged new stepdad to troubled teen Jill Schoelen and mom Shelley Hack. Seems that O'Quinn has a knack of making his way into single-mother households and enjoying the American Dream, at least until his psychotic tendencies manifest themselves!Effectively directed by genre vet Joseph Ruben, ""The Stepfather"" is a superior genre entry from the mid `80s, with O'Quinn expertly balancing the story's inherent horror with black humor, and the ever-underrated Schoelen making for a sympathetic heroine. Highly entertaining stuff for genre addicts!Shout!'s Blu-Ray and DVD editions incredibly marked the first domestic releases of ""The Stepfather,"" and neither disappoints: the transfers are both well-composed and are only limited by the film's modest budget, while the mono sound is perfectly acceptable as well. Extras include a half-hour retrospective on the picture boasting comments from Ruben, veteran producer Brian Garfield, Jill Schoelen and others, along with a commentary from the director and the original trailer.At long last available in the U.S. in a top-notch presentation, ""The Stepfather"" should be on every self-respecting horror fan's shopping list.

And that was the case in the late 80's. Moreover, it can be thought of as a Bluebeard type of a film. However, the concept of the stepfather is very simple that it worked wonders. Equally so is the idea of a man who would kill to have the most perfect family possible. Perhaps, he just might be the reason why it fell apart. Meanwhile, many have praised Terry O'Quinn's for his performance, but I think several scenes with him throwing temper tantrums are laughably cringeworthy and embarrassingly unrealistic. Nonetheless, he is effective in his role and shines through many times. Speaking of scenes, how about these transitions? One minute, the stepfather politely asks Stephanie to improve her behavior in school. The next thing that happens, she is wrestling with another girl in the art class. Another one is when Jerry asks for more ice cream and Stephanie goes to look for one, then the next thing that happens is that Jerry goes berserk in the basement. Oh, oh...how about that avenging brother? He spends all the time looking for Jerry, and the first minute he sees him, the brother is dead. It's somewhat a throw away subplot there. I enjoy watching Jill Schoelen do her part as the stepdaughter, and she does very well keeping the tension up to the very end.

Then, he must 'take care of them' the way he took care of his last three families before moving on to another new life in a new town. THE STEPFATHER is often mistaken for a common late 80s Slasher, but its finely tuned suspense and minimal gore prove to share much more with the Psychological Thriller. It plays on realistic horrors taken from true crime resources, where the perfect husband next door is hiding a sinister and deadly double life. There are many sharply written moments in the script where the dialog makes reference to Jerry's double nature without tipping any of the characters off to it, while the other family members are handled evenly in order to balance the daughter's suspicion and distrust with the wife's blinding love and comfort. The lack of motivation and explanation into Jerry's background also drives the audience's morbid fascination with the character. The one distracting element of the film is the contrived detective story headed by one of Jerry's victim's brothers, whose presumptuous conclusions are far too scripted to be believable. The aforementioned strengths would mean little were it not for TerryO'Quinn's commanding performance and his ability to snap from the lovable family man to the inescapable madman in a matter of seconds.

This is the real deal when it comes to well made, well acted, ORIGINAL, horror cinema.  This is one of the few horror films, which is like Psycho, that is a character driven tale of suspense.  Right from the opening shot the audience is aware that Terry O'Quinn's stepfather AKA Jerry is a real mean customer as he walks over the bloody corpses of his previous family.  The audience is clued into the malevolence the whole film, unlike the characters which is also a staple rule of Hitchcockian suspense.All the performances in this film are very good but Terry O'Quinn and Jill Schoelen steal the show.  They are both very good and very believable.  O'Quinn creates magic on screen creating a character who is a horrible, he has MURDERED CHILDREN--GASPS, but manages to have the audience on pins and needles when he comes close to getting caught.  The film and performance manages the miracle of subverting his horrible acts and getting us on his side, similar to Norman Bates in Psycho.  Ah, but then there's the teen rebel stepdaughter played by Jill Schoelen.  She manages to get our sympathy too.  And she's also playing a troubled and troublemaking character.  Jill Schoelen has been around the block as far as genre fare goes, and to me she is one of the great beauties to come out of the eighties(Thank you director Joe Ruben for the unnecessary Schoelen nude scene, no matter how brief).  Shelly Hack(Charlie's Angels TV show, Troll) plays Jerry's object of family desire and she shakes and traces of her Charlie's Angels past right away and pulls off the suburban housewife act well.  You really don't want to see her hurt, even though you also stress over Jerry getting caught.Now this film is frightening, suspensefull, and in some moments very intense, but my favorite thing about it, besides O'Quinn's masterful performance, is the black comedy.  It's so stark and on the money.  This is totally a reaction to the Reagan era of the early 80's.  Jerry wants the perfect family, yard, the picket fence, family dog, ETC.  Sex is not spoke about and not something that is necessary to a marriage but rather a chore.  He's repressed, homicidal, neat, Neo-Con of the scariest Dick Cheney order.  Even the firm he sells houses for as the American Eagle as it's trademark---the eagle also represents a predator which Jerry himself is as well.  The comedy is never too broad, but just right.  It all seems natural and not made out of bits or shctick.  It comes from the situation and the way crazy 'ol Jerry reacts and switches from balls out crazy to smiling family man of the decade.  Terry O'Quinn can not be praised enough for his performance in this film.  He makes the whole thing worth it.  He was born to play this part.  Now I know some of you smarty-pants film students who take everthing you hear in class or read in those nifty books about filmmaking will whine that there's no surprise or suspense in a film where you know who the killer and where the threat is coming from right from the start.  I see, STOP READING THOSE DUMB BOOKS AND ACTUALLYY TRY TO BE CREATIVE FOR ONCE!  It's much harder and way more fun to portray a film with this structure.  It's a master class in how suspense and audience manipulation works.  Hell, if people just created stores for film without thinking about structure, conventions, or necessary contrivances(like having you hero be likeable and perfect, having a twist, three acts, blah, blah, blah) a lot more interesting and memorable films will be made.Now, this new DVD, the only DVD now that I think of it, has three great special features.  A feature length commentary by director Joseph Ruben, moderated by Fangoria film critic Michael Gingold, a thirty minute retro making of doc, and the film's original theatrical trailer.  The commentary track is good, but a little too dry.  Thankfully, Gingold is there to moderate as Ruben seems to have a very sketchy memory and doesn't remember all the details.  The making of doc is very comprehenssive and features Ruben, one of the story writers, and the producers, but only Jill Scholen shows up to represent the actors.  I really want to hear Terry O'Quinn's thoughts on his iconic character, though maybe he doesn't think it's that iconic now that he has all his Lost fame in view.  Now the thing that really bummed me out about Shout Factory's special edition is the transfer itself.  It's been remastered but the print isn't cleaned up.  There's still visable pops and blemishes all throughout the film.  I really have liked them to clean the print.  It's has a high grain factor as well.  The sequel looks better on disc then the original and that's a damn shame.  Why didn't Joseph Ruben supervise the transfer himself.  I guess there was enough clout attached to this film to remake it but not shell out the cash to properly transfer it o DVD.  I wonder if they will release a Blu Ray where this problem is rectified?  This transfer issue is the only reason this baby doesn't get that fifth star, because the film in general is an easy five star joy ride.Bottom line, if you're a huge fan of this film the retro doc is a must, the commentary may be skippable, but just having this great horror film on your shelf, despite this not being the ultimate transfer of it, this is a no brainer must buy now type of thing.  Now get to it, or at least do it before you go through with spending ten bucks on the PG-13 watered down remake.",4,The only reason remaking The Stepfather was a good idea is this long overdue special

I saw this in the theaters back in 1987 and LOVED it.  Terry O'Quinn would go on to do other, higher-profile work (most notably the TV series ""Lost"") but it is hard to shake the image of him as Jerry Blake, murderous wolf in sheep's clothing.  It is perhaps the shrewdest acting work of his career.  It makes his turn as John Locke in ""Lost"" look cartoonish.  But hey, ""Lost"" is basically a cartoon anyway. A very expensively-shot cartoon, but a cartoon nonetheless.O'Quinn would appear in the lesser sequel ""Stepfather 2"" but not ""Stepfather 3"" (yes, there was a third one).  The actor who took over the role for ""S3"" did a pretty decent job of ""channeling"" O'Quinn, though.

Unfortunately, Jerry has a dark side to him, and only his stepdaughter Stephanie suspects the horrible truth: that ""Jerry"" is actually a serial killer who married widowed or divorced women with kids, plays the happy stepfather for a little while, before something sets him off, prompting him to murder every single one of them and move on to a new family and town after changing his name and appearance. Can Stephanie convince those around her of Jerry's true nature before it's too late for her and her mother? Or will Jerry's cycle of insanity and murder continue?Much has been said of Terry O'Quinn's powerful performance as Jerry and I have little to add except that I agree he's excellent in the role. His violent moodswings are truly terrifying to behold and yet, when he's calm, he honestly seems like he's trying to be a loving father.This is an excellent DVD of an even better 1980's thriller chiller. It contains two extras worthy of note: first is an audio commentary featuring director Joseph Ruben and Michael Gingold of Fangoria. It's quite interesting and informative, even if Ruben understandably forgets some of the details of the movie's production.Next up is a documentary called The Stepfather Chronicles, which covers, in detail, the process of making the movie, including how the screenwriter was inspired by the real-life incident of John List, who, like Jerry Blake, murdered his old family and moved on to a new one. Here, Joseph Ruben tends to impart much of the same information he does on the commentary (including some things verbatim), but it's negligible and everyone else's contribution to the documentary makes up for it, making The Stepfather Chronicles quite interesting to watch.",5,He'll kill for the perfect family!,1313280000,"08 14, 2011",2011,1795,"['Recently', 'widowed', 'Susan', 'met', 'perfect', 'new', 'husband', 'Jerry', 'Blake', 'Unfortunately', 'Jerry', 'dark', 'side', 'only', 'stepdaughter', 'Stephanie', 'horrible', 'truth', 'Jerry', 'actually', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'married', 'widowed', 'divorced', 'women', 'kids', 'happy', 'stepfather', 'little', 'while', 'something', 'sets', 'off', 'prompting', 'murder', 'single', 'one', 'move', 'new', 'family', 'town', 'changing', 'name', 'appearance', 'Can', 'Stephanie', 'convince', 'Jerry', 'true', 'nature', 'too', 'late', 'mother', 'will', 'Jerry', 'cycle', 'insanity', 'murder', 'continue', 'Much', 'been', 'said', 'Terry', ""O'Quinn"", 'powerful', 'performance', 'Jerry', 'have', 'little', 'add', 'agree', 'excellent', 'role', 'violent', 'moodswings', 'are', 'truly', 'terrifying', 'behold', 'yet', 'when', 'calm', 'honestly', 'trying', 'be', 'loving', 'father.This', 'excellent', 'DVD', 'even', 'better', '1980', 'thriller', 'chiller', 'two', 'extras', 'worthy', 'note', 'first', 'audio', 'commentary', 'featuring', 'director', 'Joseph', 'Ruben', 'Michael', 'Gingold', 'Fangoria', 'quite', 'interesting', 'informative', 'even', 'Ruben', 'understandably', 'details', 'movie', 'production.Next', 'up', 'documentary', 'called', 'Stepfather', 'Chronicles', 'detail', 'process', 'making', 'movie', 'including', 'how', 'screenwriter', 'was', 'inspired', 'real-life', 'incident', 'John', 'List', 'who', 'Jerry', 'Blake', 'murdered', 'old', 'family', 'moved', 'new', 'one', 'Here', 'Joseph', 'Ruben', 'impart', 'much', 'same', 'information', 'commentary', 'including', 'things', 'verbatim', 'negligible', 'everyone', 'else', 'contribution', 'documentary', 'up', 'making', 'Stepfather', 'Chronicles', 'quite', 'interesting', 'watch']",N/A

The picture on &#34;The Stepfather&#34; appears a bit dirty and unpolished, the sound a bit under-produced. Yet even in this state I find the movie a collector's item. Before there was Hannibal Lecter and the American Psycho (and after Henry), there was the stepfather, a perfect role for the breakout actor Terry O'Quinn, who does steal the show here--he is genuinely terrifying here. As a film, &#34;The Stepfather&#34; isn't perfect--but it's one of the best of its type, certainly more chilling than gross out, which is saying something. It probably doesn't fit under the label &#34;horror&#34; very neatly, but it is subtly disturbing and memorable.The Shout! DVD also includes a neat making of featurette, which shows author Brian Garfield's thoughts, among other ideas from the filmmakers. It's a keeper bonus feature. Since we are so inundated these days with slasher movies and gross out effects, to say that &#34;The Stepfather&#34; is essential is superfluous. But as a suspense movie, it's quite thrilling--if not terribly surprising. The film does, however, have good economic sense, a belief that smaller is okay after all, the intelligence to make more out of less, and it features fine performances and a good script. Director Ruben should have continued making abnormal psychology studies such as this rather than turning his hand to cheap exploitation shockers that inspire bad thoughts and behavior (such as the very regrettable &#34;The Good Son&#34;). &#34;The Stepfather&#34; is violent to watch, but you know who the bad guy is, and you know to be afraid of him.

Not because it's scary, but because then you won't have anyone to make nutty comments with.There are two reasons this film is worth watching.1.  Terry O'Quinn (Locke, ofLostfame) is simply a fantastic actor.  His portrayal of the demented stepfather is so spot on, you don't miss or need any of the clunky exposition most modern horrors would include to give you an idea of why he's so messed up in the head.2.  The rest of the film is unintentionally hilarious.  How so?  Oh, let me count the ways!  (Beware: key plot points are revealed ahead.)-- O'Quinn's acting is so great, it makes everyone else look like barely credible puppets.-- O'Quinn's stepfather is a man obsessed with the perfect family, and when his family (like most) proves to be flawed, why he simply murders them and moves on.  The brother of his most recent victim is the only one pursuing him (a year after the fact), and he goes after him with the zeal of a junkie hunting down his next hit.  One wonders why he's in such a rush, when he's waited a full year to go looking for the guy.  Then, when he finally confronts the stepfather, well, you'll see.  It's bloody hilarious.-- O'Quinn's new stepdaughter absolutely hates him for no apparent reason.  I mean, we all know he's a killer from the first scene of the film, but she seems to suspect him only because it gives the plot some necessary tension.  Taken at face value, she seems to WANT him to be a psychopath.-- The stepdaughter is so troubled, she has regular visits with a counselor/psychiatrist/psychologist who is so unprofessional, I kept expecting the movie to reveal that he had an inappropriately intimate relationship with the girl.  Not so.  He's just a really crappy doctor.-- Every once in a while the movie shows characters playfully gadding about in leaves or having humourous fake fights with each other.  These moments are so contrived and fake, they completely void the character development they are meant to portray.-- There are at least a dozen scenes that add absolutely nothing to the story and are bizarrely placed.  You'll know them when you see them.Scary?  No.  Fun?  Sure.
