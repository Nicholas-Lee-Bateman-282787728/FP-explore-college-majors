I'm seriously shocked right now.Furthermore, this movie almost has an epic feel to it.  The movie is bigger, more ""complex"" (by comedy standards) and funnier than I EVER would've imagined.I won't lie to you though- it might take a few minutes to warm up to Adam Sandler's character.  Sometimes his accent isn't always clear, and other times it's just downright sloppy and unbelievable.  Still, give the story time to develop, and you should be in for a really good time.Probably not as good as the Waterboy though, but this movie comes OH so close to matching the greatness of that one.Some of the scenes that brought a smile to my face, or downright made me laugh like a school girl-- the scene where Adam's character was ""feeling up"" his customers at the hair salon and treating the older ladies like they were young and extremely attractive.  He would constantly hit on the ladies with his inappropriate words.  After that, Adam's character would take them to the back room of the salon and... you know!- he was playing a game where he was bouncing a cat with the top of his feet, similar to things ball players tend to do while warming up, haha.- the part where he was peeing in the litter box was golden!- making a little child cry when he said that the boys veins would probably be accidentally cut if the boy didn't sit still for a haircut, lol- swimming like a professional while chasing a guy on a jet ski- playing pinball with a grenade- constantly saying inappropriate things to Americans, and the people sort of forgiving him because of his accent and where he's from- tying people into knots by folding their arms and legs, haha- fighting a group of bad guys in super speed fast motion.  similar to this scene would be the one where he drank a bottle of yellow liquid in a matter of two seconds after being hesitant if he should drink it or notThis was just a really funny movie.

1182436,A25HYPL2XKQPZB,B001DPHD9C,Bill Garrison,"[2, 4]","YOU DON'T MESS WITH THE ZOHAN is Adam Sandler's latest attempt at making a funny movie. This time, he's created Zohan, an Israeli counter-terrorist who is tired of all the killing and hate and wants to move to America to become, of all things, a hairstylist.The Palestinian Phantom (John Turturro) is the Zohan's bitter enemy, and Zohan fakes his death during a fight to move to America and assume a new identity. The movie switches to a fish out of water story as Zohan comes to America to try and find a job cutting hair at a Palestinian salon.The movie had me at this point and then lost me. In Sandler's comedies, he seems to make movies involving quirky characters (Little Nicky, Zohan, Waterboy) or movies with characters you are a bit more normal yet very crazy (Happy Gilmore, Mr. Deeds, 50 First Dates). Some are good, some are bad, and as this movie went on, I felt it getting worse and worse.The main running joke of Zohan's sexual prowess quickly became old and a two hour movie based on Israeli humor just doesn't have staying power. Sandler tried to stick the formula that you see in all his movies. This film has funny characters, crazy situations, cameos, and Sandler regulars (Tuturro, Kevin Nealon, Rob Scneider.)If you're debating whether or not to watch this movie, I say don't. You'll save a lot of time. Sandler is either hit or miss, and this is a big miss. Also, I watched the unrated version.

This movie is so over the top, it doesn't even try to be serious and thats not a bad thing. I found myself laughing many times through out this movie, and every time I thought I had seen it all something wackier would happen in the next scene.Adam Sandler plays an Israeli Special Forces soldier Zohan Dvir, who is really good at what he does, but is tired of fighting and wants to come to America to become a hairdresser, when he tells his parents of this they laugh at him. So Zohan decides to fake his own death on his next assignment where he is to hunt down his Palestinian nemesis (The Phantom)  played by John Turturro. After his faked death Zohan stowes away in the luggage compartment of a plane where he gives himself a haircut, as well as the two pooches he's sharing a cage with Scrappy and Coco, this is where he gets his American name from (Scrappy Coco). Once in America Zohan tries to get a job at the Paul Mitchell Salon but is laughed at, eventually he ends up working in a small time shop run by a Palestinina woman named Dalia played by Emmanuelle Chriqui. With his unusual style and ways with the older women Zohan turns this little shop into the talk of the town. Zohan has to deal with an angry business man (played by Michael Buffer), an ex-enemy who recognizes him (Rob Schneider), white supremacists the leader played by James O'Skanlon, and the return of the Phantom who had become a local hero in his country after he thought he killed Zohan. The madness goes on and on.This movie is so over the top, and Adam Sandler is great as Zohan in this movie who is practically super human it's ridiculous but in a good way. I saw the movie over Netflixes streaming service, and would urge anyone who has this service and has not seen this movie to check it out, I give this movie a 4 out of 5 which considering comedies are not my favorite type of movies shows how much I did enjoy it.

This time it didn't happen, sure there were laughs but very few in muddled mess of film; the cast does what it can with this slug of script. But stoop to using over the top crude humor to be funny, too bad I wanted to like this film more than I did. I mean I don't mind once in awhile a little crude humor like one or two times in a film. This film was just seeing what it could get away with and still get PG-13 rating, I got it the first time he was having sex with boy's mother he was staying with (it's implied and doesn't show any breasts, just her head and legs and the back of her butt in shot), who cares how big his hair is around his member is. Didn't care after, I lost track of how many times they used that one until I was about to scream inside, they beat that joke like a dead horse I was cringing in my seat hoping they wouldn't use that one again they did, oh boy. Oh should I mention the numerous times you see Adam Sandler's butt in this film making you want to go ewww after the countless times seeing it, once is enough thank you.It's wasn't all bad the first half of film was great filled with great funny stuff and action to watch as we Zohan kick butt in his naive country, then when comes to America there were a few laughs at the beginning but it runs of steam too soon, In the middle left with nothing but bottom of barrel cheap shots, the ending message of film was nice though.I wish this film could've been funnier than it was; I was hoping to leave in stitches, but got cringes instead.

This film in my eyes is typical Sandler, just not funny. The film is based around Zohan an Isreali soldier sick of all the fighting with the Lebanese and he decides to fake his death and run off to America to become a hairdresser. Zohan played by Sandler is a man who seems to be the greatest man in the world, with all the skill, ability and what we're lead to believe to be the biggest genitals in the world.Don't get me wrong I'm as big a fan of the silly or slightly moronic films as the next guy, but this film was just ridiculous from start to finish and just became quite pointless. I honestly don't get what people see in Sandlers movies as they're just stupid and the whole silly accent thing just wares thin. It does have its cool, albeit funny parts and I give it credit for that. He can also be credited for making movies with a good message, but when you're trying to present a heartfelt message on top of a blatantly stupid movie, you're just going to be ignored.It does contain the typical supporting cast and random cameos.

At first I didn't have high expectations for the movie just because of what I read in the back (I guess I was biased), but boy did I change my mind! I only rated it four stars instead of five because of the major crude humor and how it isn't a movie that I would recommend to anyone under 13 (although I believe most kids under that age went to see the movie).My favorite part of the movie was where Adam Sandler character (Zohan) does the funny clapping pushups (that really cracked me up) to impress the pretty Palestinian girl in order to get the job at the hair salon. It would be nice if people can jobs today solely on the basis of doing pushups! But anyone the Zohan finally impresses her enough that she offers him the job to style hair.The major theme of the movie is that the Zohan is trying to get away from his ""fighting terrorism"" roots back at his home in Isreal. He fakes his own death after a scene in the water with John Tuturo's character and makes him believes he actually killed the Zohan. We of course know this isn't true. Both major characters of the movie come into a head on confrontation later in the movie. I don't want to spoil the climax by saying what happens, but I just want to say that friendships can turn out even in the worst of arguments and fights.And finally Emmanuel Chiriqu's character (the Palenstian hair dresser) does a terrific job acting and being the Zohan's significant other.

1182449,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001DPHD9C,Chris Pandolfi,"[2, 3]","""You Don't Mess with the Zohan"" may be the most shameless movie of the year, if not the decade. There may be other films this carefree with Middle Eastern stereotypes and jokes about hummus, but they probably don't have the same comedic style. The film's sense of humor, if that truly is a fitting description, is so bizarre and so overplayed that it has to be seen to be believed. Not that you'll believe it by the time you leave the theater; if anything, you'll be even more dumbfounded. I can't for the life of me give you a good reason to see this movie, because I don't think one exists; I can only say that, on some crude, juvenile level, it achieves what it wanted to achieve, and by the end, it actually redeems itself. I'm sure that many, if not most, will be less forgiving, and that proves just how far I can let my guard down.It's also likely that many will be offended by this movie, not only because of the abundant stereotypes, but also because the ongoing dispute between Israelis and Palestinians is used as comedy relief. A religious war is certainly ridiculous, but that doesn't mean it's funny. Then again, maybe it does; the ethnic jokes in ""You Don't Mess with the Zohan"" are so obvious that, in my opinion, you couldn't take them seriously even if you wanted to. It's not about making a political or social statement; it's about being an over the top comedy, and nothing more. Yes, I laughed out loud a couple of times, although it had more to do with the audacity of the filmmakers than with the actual gags. Most of the gags are amusing at best, predictable at worst. One exception is a moment when a cat is being used as a hacky sack--that wasn't funny at all.The plot: Zohan (Adam Sandler) is Israel's leading Mossad agent, a master at tracking down and capturing Palestinian terrorists. His strength and agility are not too far removed from Superman's: he can do pushups without using his hands; he can land on his feet after jumping from dizzying heights; he can catch flying bullets with his nostrils; he can swim exactly like a dolphin; he can subdue fussy children the Vulcan neck pinch. And don't even get me started on his inhumanly high pain threshold; to prove his point, he intentionally lets a meat-eating fish have its way with his oversized crotch (and this is not the last time that part of his body will be exploited for laughs). Despite these superhero-like abilities and a steady job, Zohan is unhappy with his life, dead tired of Israel's social unrest. His real passion is cutting and styling hair. As he flips through the pages of an outdated Paul Mitchell catalogue, he dreams of going to the United States and working at a high-end salon.He finally smuggles himself into the county via a dog cage in the cargo hold of a plane. He makes friends with the two dogs already in the cage, going so far as to give them new `dos. A newly trimmed Zohan enters New York City under an alias that combines the dogs' names--Scrappy Coco--and initially has no luck securing a job. He does, however, befriend a timid young man named Michael (Nick Swardson) and his mother, Gail (Lainie Kazan). To further protect his identity, Zohan tells everyone that he's half Australian, half Mount Everest; his accent just happens to sound Israeli. No one seems to notice anything odd, least of all Gail, who Zohan begins having sex with. Why, I have no idea, but I guess it doesn't really matter.After a few days, Zohan goes to the Middle Eastern section of town and meets Oori (Ido Mosseri), who immediately recognizes Israel's most famous counter-terrorist. Rather than let him settle into the lifeless world of selling electronics at bargain prices (at a store actually named Going Out of Business), Oori encourages Zohan to keep looking for a salon job. He finds one across the street, which will be awkward since that's the Palestinian side. Here enters Dalia, (Emmanuelle Chriqui), the pretty young woman who owns the salon; she refuses to let him cut anyone's hair, but she does hire him as a volunteer sweeper. When Zohan finally gets his big break, he introduces a clientele of elderly women an unbelievable experience. I mean this in more ways than one--let's just say that his services are just as orgasmic as their hairstyles. At last, Zohan's dream of making the world silky smooth is coming true.But trouble is afoot. A bitter Palestinian cabdriver named Salim (Rob Schneider) recognizes Zohan and contacts a terrorist known as the Phantom (John Turturro), owner of a Middle Eastern fast food chain; he and Zohan have been archenemies for many years, and now it's time to settle the score. Zohan also has to face a greedy developer (Michael Buffer), who wants to shut down every Middle Eastern store in that section of New York; he wants to bulldoze them to make room for a mall. He'll go to any lengths to stop the shop owners, including hiring a group of gun-toting white supremacists to kick start a race war between Israelis and Palestinians. Can Zohan unite both peoples to save their businesses? Will this ethnic tension allow the love between him and Dalia to blossom? Can he and the Phantom find some common ground? The answer to these questions doesn't matter in the slightest--if you're thinking of seeing ""You Don't Mess with the Zohan,"" it's because you want to laugh, not because you want to think. You may laugh a lot, or you may not laugh at all. I guess it depends on how silky smooth you like your comedies.",4,"He's Got a Hairdryer, and He's Not Afraid to Use It",1212969600,"06 9, 2008",2008,5461,"['Do', ""n't"", 'Mess', 'Zohan', 'may', 'be',

Zohan is a crazy and outrageous character and the movie is hilariously funny... the only good movie Sandler has done. Sandler plays Zohan, an Israeli intelligence operative who fakes his death to go to America and become a hairdresser. John Turturro plays Phantom, Zohan's Palestinian arch-rival. Both of these guys are outrageous. Their characters seem to have superhuman abilities and their battle scene is tremendously funny. After Zohan moves to America, going by an assumed name ""Scrappy Coco"" so as not to be recognized, he falls in love with his boss, Dalia (Emmanuelle Chriqui), a Palestinian woman who runs a hair salon. Later, it is revealed that she is the sister of Phantom.  And when a local developer tries to terrorize the neighborhood, Zohan and Phantom team up to stop him. The story is absurd but fun. The action and stunts are outrageous and fun. You will notice many of Sandler's fellow SNL actors in bit parts; including Rob Schneider as a Palestine cab driver who seeks revenge against Zohan, and Chris Rock in a cameo role as a Jamaican cab driver.

So far this summer, all the films I have seen were either great (""Iron Man"") or good (""Prince Caspian"", ""Indy Jones and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" and ""Sex and the City"").  Unfortunately, ""Zohan"" doesn't rank much higher than fair.After seeing the preview for Adam Sandler's new comedy, I was eager to see the movie.  However, though this film does have some funny moments, it doesn't quite measure up to the trailer's promise.The story is this:  An Israeli counter-terrorist is tired of his life of fighting, war and killing and wants to make a drastic change in his life....to move to the States and become a hair stylist.  After faking his own death at the hands of the Phantom, a Palestian terrorist, he flies to New York to pursue his dream.  Once in the big city, he is befriended by a young man and his mother (played by a very funny Lanie Kazan) and a young Israeli who recognizes him as the Zohan.  While his dreams of working at the Paul Mitchell Salon doesn't pan out, he instead finds work, eventually, at a struggly beauty shop owned by a beautiful Palestian girl.Over time, though, a Palestian who was wronged by the Zohan (the Zohan took his goat) realizes the super soldier is in New York and plots to capture him, return him to Israel and become a bigger hero than the Phantom, who because of his celebrity, now owns a huge chain of restaurants.The premise is a funny one but Sandler and his crew never seem to truly reach the needed laughs to put this project over the top.  Sandler's Zohan is a likeable character but the rest of the movie just seems disjointed and doesn't deliver enough laughs to warrant a good review.  There are plenty of cameos from big names---Chris Rock, Kevin James, John McEnroe, and Mariah Carey but even these stars' inclusion doesn't give the film the boost it needs.  The best scenes involve the Zohan working his magic in the salon and his interaction with Lainie Kazan (and her long suffering son).  The movie also had the underlying ""why can't we all get along"" theme which is a nice message though I doubt it will have little impact on anyone.Zohan is not one of Sandler's best.

I thought it started out funnier than it ended - granted by the ending there was more of a 'message' angle to things, but I thought the quality of acting and the pace just seemed to lose it more towards the end.  Could have been all the guest stars (Chris Rock as a Haitian/Jamaican cabbie? Winkler as.. who? etc).  And while Sandler kept up his end mostly throughout, some of the supporting characters seemed too 'American' to be spoofing the Middle East - though some did the job well enough.  The girl salon boss that he loves - she occasionally seems to forget her 'Palestinian' accent..  But whatever - it's not like you were taking this movie TOO seriously anyway, though I do think it could have been better had they played it a little tighter in some places.  There are some good gags, though the gimmick starts to wear off a little toward the end as 'the message' kicks in.  It's a fair enough message though I'll say that.I wanted to see this movie and now I have.  It's on the better side of Sandler films, most of which I've seen.  I don't think it's better than some of the classics, for example ""Bulletproof"", ""The Waterboy"", ""The Wedding Singer"" or in his deeper fare, the excellent ""Punch Drunk Love"".  I even liked ""Funny People"" more.  But it is an interesting and original character in the Sandler catalogue all things considered.  No, I don't think it's comparable to Borat, as someone mentioned - another great movie btw - though speaking of Sacha Baron Kohen, this movie Zohan may be of more resemblance to Kohen's ""Bruno"" which was TRULY hilarious - I ached from laughing so hard when I saw that. That movie however makes the crude humor in ""Zohan"" look tame (you've been warned!).  All things considered, I'm not sure Zohan is really 4 star material, but if not then it's a very high 3.

Unlike Iron Man, Kingdom of the Crytstal Skull or Hulk, Zohan has gotten it right. All of the bonus features are available on one disc. The quality of the Blu Ray picture exceeds what Zohan is able to deliver (you can clearly see when the movie is using a green screen - for a flick in New York, no idea why there isn't more filmed on location).Most people understand that Blu Ray discs have massive amounts of storage space, far more than a 120 minute movie will take up. Every single special feature is available through the pop up menu. If you're watching the movie and want to look at the language dictionary (Zohan has its own form of yiddish), you can simply pop to it, check it out and go back to the movie in the same spot. To me, this is almost as important as the upgrade in picture quality (wich Zohan lacks due to poor implementation of green screen). All that said, it was worth it to grab on Blu Ray and be able to use all the features the format offers.The movie is probably Sandler's weekest since Little Nicky. That said, I still laughed out loud several times and John Turturro steals every scene he's in. It tackles politics in the same manner Chuck and Larry approached gay rights, so you are likely to be offended, but at its warped core, it has a good heart.

Normally I'd turn my nose up at paying $10 to see such a film in the theaters, but, as I said, it was a loooow day.While there were some undeniably funny spots in this film, my overall sense walking away from it was: WHY?My thoughts:~I love hummus...I don't know if I'll ever be able to look at it the same after this flick.~It's PG-13...I would be EXTREMELY embarrassed to take my 13 sister (or 15 year old brother)to this movie.  I'm no prude, but this was beyond crass and barely bordered on not being graphic (just because only a little flesh was shown).  Okay, my brother would watch it, but he'd be laughing mostly at the sophomoric stuff rather than the miserable and horse-beaten attempts at satire.~The satire...I keep an ear to the mid-East conflict more than most average Americans, of this I'm sure (not saying I'm smarter, just more of a news junkie).  This movie does more service in creating or reinforcing stereotypes on which prejudices will ride anew rather than actually serve as a smart satire.  I think back to watching Team America World Police...funny, funny stuff, but they used puppets for Petesake.  Still, when I left the theater, I knew their would be others leaving singing the theme song as their new personal anthem...""Team America, f*** yeah!""Satire in this day and age does not need to be as deeply hidden as comedy movies tend to do.  It makes the movie feel like 90% plain stupid trying to talk to a stupid audience (which I don't think most Americans are) with 10% stuff that only folks with college degrees or PhD's will catch.Movie-goers don't really like being insulted as much as Hollywood execs seem to think.Sandler is a smart comedian and comedic producer.  However, as he moves forward in his career, I pray to the Gods of comedy that he finds a more balanced approach.  Satire? Parody? Slapstick?

1182474,A26X2TG93OTXVU,B001DPHD9C,Justin Heath,"[11, 14]","While I've never been a -huge- fan of Adam Sandler's films, I have watched them and laughed throughout most of them. I'm the type of guy who enjoys some slapstick, some raunchy humor, and a lot of zanyness.I went into Zohan not expecting anything but pure frivolous humor. You don't go into films like this with any expectations, and I think that's where a lot of the reviewers prior to myself went wrong. They went in expecting to see an evolution of Sandler's humor, and while I would say that Zohan raised the bar a tad, it's still Adam Sandler. Yes, it's going to have a corny ending, a lot of physical humor, and a healthy dose of humor aimed at the more intelligent in the crowd as well.Overall, I couldn't stop giggling, laughing, and chuckling throughout most of the film. After a long streak of not seeing any humor films, I thought it was the perfect thing to bring me back to comedies. The last few years, especially, have been incredibly lackluster in regards to comedies (if that's what evolution of the genre is, count me out, by the way), and I found Zohan refreshing.I think another thing a lot of the other reviewers missed, is that the film in no way expected to take itself seriously. The only serious moments were cheesy, predictable, and ultimately corny, which is irony in itself and only contributed to my bemused chuckling. Yes, a lot of the humor bordered on racial stereotyping, there were a lot of over-the-top accents and allusions to the Middle East, so if you're the type to get touchy about that, feel free to skip. I found it to be a rather hilarious joke on the seriousness that everybody applies to the stereotyping. The stereotyping is, actually, rather fair and towards the end even shows plenty of ""good stereotyping"" (as accurate as stereotyping ever is, which is to say, rarely).Really, the film laughs at itself. Are there some bum moments? Certainly, but it seems that's been the case for almost every film I've seen in the last few years, but it was grand seeing the cast and crew not try to make this the 'next great comedy' and just have a load of fun.

Although there were some slow spots, I was often laughing soooo hard and soooo loud it's a wonder they didn't tell me to get out of the theater. I'm not really an Adam Sandler fan but he looked good in this movie (nice bod) and was so funny.  A lot of the movie was sexual humor.Zohar is an Israeli counter-terrorist, the best in the business.  His moves make James Bond look challenged. Of course, the moves are way exaggerated, which make them even funnier.  Anyway, Zohar is tired of the business.  He wants to go to America and just cut hair.  He has always had this dream to be a hair stylist. He tells his parents but they laugh it off. So, the next time he is in a fight with a Palestinian, he fakes his death and sneaks off to the USA.  He lands in New York, of course, and tries to get a job at several salons, but having no experience or training is a hinderance.  He makes a guy friend, who also works in NY, and the guy friend suggests that Zohar go across the street to the Palestinian run beauty shop and ask for a job.  That argument goes around the barn a couple of times, but he is desparate and he does not tell the young and pretty Palestinian lady boss he is Israeli.  As a matter of fact, he tells most people he is Australian and Tibetan.He gets a job sweeping up cut hair, for no pay, in the hopes that he will eventually get a chance to cut hair.  The chance soon comes, as a stylist quits and a customer says, ""Does he cut hair?  I'll take him.""  Well, on goes the music and up goes Mr. Weenie as Zohar gives a great haircut, and finishes with a very special top off.  Next thing you know, Zohar's skills are in big demand.  The ladies are lining up around the block just waiting for the shop to open.It's not for the kids (cause they would ask too many questions, especially when Mommy goes to the hairdresser again).  I think both the guys and the ladies will love this one.  Who cares if the plot is weak. By the way, a few guest appearances, like Mariah Carey and others.

It's just not funny, not that Sandler, who's other films (Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison, Little Nicky, Click), I found hilarious. I love stupid comedy films (Blades of Glory and Semi-Pro had some great stuff in them) but this was just so bland.It's hard to describe why this film is so bad. Lots of him doing physically incredible things as the Israeli Super Soldier, putting a fish down his swim trunks, catching one in his butt, tying guys into pretzels, just doesn't work. I think it comes down to the filmmakers doing ""funny stuff"" instead of coming from a character base. Most of these goofy comedies are about an extremely incompetent guy, believing he's capable in a competent world. Here you have an incredibly competent character who never fails at whatever he does, hence there's not even a question of whether he'll succeed in his mission or get the girl at the end. And there was absolutely no connection between him and the romantic interest.I can't remember the last time I watched a movie that didn't have at least some redeeming qualities, but I felt after watching this that I really did waste my time and I hope I can save you the same loss.**SPOILER ALERT***one of the things they passed right over is that in order for Zohan to pursue his dream as a hairdresser, he fakes his own death.

Zohan, an Israeli soldier, can outswim motor vessels, can snort bullets up his nose without injury, and can leap tall buildings in a single bound. Tired of the endless violence of the Middle East, he fakes his own death to escape to New York, where he becomes a hairdresser with the name of ""Scrappy Coco.""Although first turned away from the great New York salons, ""Scrappy"" soon builds a devoted following, a la Warren Beatty in SHAMPOO, of middle-aged matrons (""I make you silky smooth, yes?"") in a small shop owned by a Palestinian girl, with whom he soon finds himself falling in love.But ""Scrappy"" can't leave his old life behind. The Israeli electronics merchants and the falafel salesmen of the neighborhood all secretly know who he is, as do the Arab rug merchants and cabdrivers. Any note of neighborhood violence brings out the Zohan, whose favorite technique for subduing bad guys is to tie them into a pretzel knot.When a small gang of angry Arabs tries to kill Zohan with a bomb, they mangle their English so badly that the chemist sells them Neosporin instead of explosives; but this act inspires a neighborhood redeveloper hungry to build a mall on this New York street of small shops, to incite a riot between the Arab and Israeli factions of the neighborhood by sending white supremacists in burnous to attack the various establishments.Although there is much finger pointing, shouting, and throwing of hummus, the Arabs and Israelis suddenly realize that the attack is continuing despite the fact that they're all too busy arguing to fight. At that moment, the Zohan and his Palestinian nemesis, the Phantom, join forces to fight the true enemy.Peace is restored, and the factions join hands:Abdul: Why does everybody think I'm carrying a bomb all the time?Ali: It's the beard. If you sat down next to me on a plane, I'd probably switch to another flight, myself.Mohammed: It's not easy for us Arabs! Everybody thinks we're terrorists!Oded:It's not easy for us Israelis either!

Zohan is definitely an acquired taste, and for the most part, so are Adam Sandler films.  I'm not gonna try to convince anybody to see or buy this, just to let the few that enjoyed it know they are not alone.  I thought the first 90% was good, funny, stupid, over-the-top, crazy fun.  The ending sequences were disappointing though, beginning with the hackey-sack/Maraiah Carey scenes into the final action sequence.  That made the film anti-climatic for me.  But before all that there were some very good moments that were just so outrageous that i just went with it.But i'm here to rant about the dvd.  I'm really tired of movies being released as a movie-only/no-frills version for almost $20, while the 2-disc spec.ed./version with all the extras are around $25.  If they pull that, i just rent the movie or wait for a price drop down the line.  But i bought the dvd version of Zohan(without seeing it beforehand) on new release-tuesday for $17.  Why?  Cause i wanted to see it, am a Sandler fan, and because they actually had an unrated, extended, single disc edition with a bunch of extras on it for $17(debut sale-price)!  There's also a 2-disc version if you wanted that, but the single one was loaded: 2 commentaries(including a good one with Sandler, Swardson, Smigel, and Schneider), and 10 featurettes plus deleted scenes made this a worthy purchase.Basically, effort on the dvd = support with my money.  So, 3 stars for film.  Round up to 4 if you're a big Sandler fan/apologist or are very open-minded to idiotic humor(like me).  Add that 5th star for them loading the dvd with extras on the cheaper, unrated, single-disc edition.  It's getting quite rare to see that now, so it's refreshing to see a worthy dvd release of the 'basic' version.",5,"less like a review, more of a rant...",1224028800,"10 15, 2008",2008,1793,"['Lots', 'negative', 'reviews', 'Zohan', 'definitely', 'acquired', 'taste', 'most', 'part', 'so', 'are', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'films', ""'m"", 'not', 'gon', 'try', 'convince', 'anybody', 'see', 'buy', 'just', 'let', 'few', 'enjoyed', 'are', 'not', 'alone', 'thought', 'first', '90', '%', 'was', 'good', 'funny', 'stupid', 'over-the-top', 'crazy', 'fun', 'ending', 'sequences', 'were', 'disappointing', 'beginning', 'hackey-sack/Maraiah', 'Carey', 'scenes', 'final', 'action', 'sequence', 'made', 'film', 'anti-climatic', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'moments', 'were', 'just', 'so', 'outrageous', 'i', 'just', 'went', 'it.But', 'i', ""'m"", 'here', 'rant', 'dvd', ""'m"", 'really', 'tired', 'movies', 'being', 'released', 'movie-only/no-frills', 'version', 'almost', '20', '2-disc', 'spec.ed./version', 'extras', 'are', '25', 'pull', 'i', 'just', 'rent', 'movie', 'wait', 'price', 'drop', 'line', 'i', 'bought', 'dvd', 'version', 'Zohan', 'seeing', 'beforehand', 'new', 'release-tuesday', '17', 'Why', 'Cause', 'i', 'wanted', 'see', 'am', 'Sandler', 'fan', 'actually', 'had', 'unrated', 'extended', 'single', 'disc', 'edition', 'bunch', 'extras', '17', 'debut', 'sale-price', 'also', '2-disc', 'version', 'wanted', 'single', 'one', 'was', 'loaded', '2', 'commentaries', 'including', 'good', 'one', 'Sandler', 'Swardson', 'Smigel', 'Schneider', '10', 'featurettes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'made', 'worthy', 'purchase.Basically', 'effort', 'dvd', '=', 'support', 'money', 'So', '3', 'stars', 'film', 'Round', '4', ""'re"", 'big', 'Sandler', 'fan/apologist', 'are', 'very', 'open-minded', 'idiotic', 'humor', 'Add', '5th', 'star', 'loading', 'dvd', 'extras', 'cheaper', 'unrated', 'single-disc', 'edition', 'getting', 'quite', 'rare', 'see', 'now', 'refreshing', 'see', 'worthy', 'dvd', 'release', ""'basic"", 'version']",N/A

1182491,A1U360OMVQRPUB,B001DPHD9C,Mel Odom,"[3, 4]","Sometimes you just have to be a fan to appreciate something.  I found that to be the case in Adam Sandler's new movie, YOU DON'T MESS WITH THE ZOHAN.  I loved HAPPY GILMORE and have seen it several times, and there's a soft spot in my heart for BIG DADDY.  I even got excited over the trailers for this latest release.But when I arrived at the theater, the laughs just didn't come as fast or as frequent as I'd hoped.  Sandler was his usual charming self, and unafraid to give it all for the movie and the camera, but the subject matter may still have been a little too sensitive.  The movie was originally written back in 2000, then allowed to cool after the events of 9-11.Sandler stars as Zohan, an Israeli counter-terrorist operative who has seemingly unexplained superpowers.  That proved confusing for me right off the bat because I was expecting some kind of origin story or at least a reason for all the incredible physical abilities that Zohan had.  I mean, he was catching bullets between his forefinger and thumb, and managing leaps and jumps that would have shamed a ninja master.John Turturro was the Palestinian counterpart named the Phantom who possessed amazing powers as well.  The dialogue between the two as they fought and argued is well done, and Turturro was great as usual.  But again, I believe the material just got tired in the end.Zohan's dream is to get out of the counter-terrorist trade and into hair dressing.  He's got a 1980s Paul Mitchell style book that he's studied for years (although it's out of date) and a desire that is all-encompassing.  In his final battle against the Phantom, Zohan fakes his own death and smuggles himself into the United States to attempt to achieve his dream.Once in the US, Zohan hooks up with a guy named Michael, introduces himself as Scrappy Coco, and ends up living with Michael.  Unfortunately, he also enters into a sexual relationship with Michael's mom that leaves Michael totally distressed.  These bits are funny and keep the movie rolling along, but they just fail to engage past the superficial level.Then there's the romantic twist.  While working in Dhalia's style shop, Zohan gives haircuts to the older women in the neighborhood and ends up taking them for sex in the back room.  Nothing explains this bizarre behavior, nor why Zohan felt he had to provide this, but his performances become legendary and fill the shop with clients.  Ultimately this saves the shop from the predacious attentions of Walbridge Industries (a blatant stab at Wal-Mart, which is interesting because so many of Sandler's movies are sold in those department stores).The movie shifts gears so rapidly that the cameos by Mariah Carey and the subplot involving Rob Schneider as a Palestinian who lost his goat to Zohan only reach the level of props and gags.  Even the romance with Dhalia (Emmanuelle Chriqui) gets lost in the mish-mash.As stated, Sandler fans will be happy, but regular moviegoers lured in by the well-constructed trailer might be somewhat disappointed.  This isn't a comic James Bond movie; it's a chain of gags that hit and miss with irregularity.",3,Fun But Nothing Lasting,1213488000,"06 15, 2008",2008,3122,"['Sometimes', 'just', 'have', 'be', 'fan', 'appreciate', 'something', 'found', 'be', 'case', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'new', 'movie', 'YOU', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'MESS', 'WITH', 'THE', 'ZOHAN', 'loved', 'HAPPY', 'GILMORE', 'have', 'seen', 'several', 'times', 'soft', 'spot', 'heart', 'BIG', 'DADDY', 'even', 'got', 'excited', 'trailers', 'latest', 'release.But', 'when', 'arrived', 'theater', 'laughs', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'fast', 'as', 'frequent', ""'d"", 'hoped', 'Sandler', 'was', 'usual', 'charming', 'self', 'unafraid', 'give', 'movie', 'camera', 'subject', 'matter', 'may', 'still', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'too', 'sensitive', 'movie', 'was', 'originally', 'written', 'back', '2000', 'then', 'allowed', 'cool', 'events', '9-11.Sandler', 'stars', 'Zohan', 'Israeli', 'counter-terrorist', 'operative', 'who', 'seemingly', 'unexplained', 'superpowers', 'proved', 'confusing', 'right', 'off', 'bat', 'was', 'expecting', 'kind', 'origin', 'story', 'least', 'reason', 'incredible', 'physical', 'abilities', 'Zohan', 'had', 'mean', 'was', 'catching', 'bullets', 'forefinger', 'thumb', 'managing', 'leaps', 'jumps', 'would', 'have', 'shamed', 'ninja', 'master.John', 'Turturro', 'was', 'Palestinian', 'counterpart', 'named', 'Phantom', 'who', 'possessed', 'amazing', 'powers', 'as', 'well', 'dialogue', 'two', 'fought', 'argued', 'well', 'done', 'Turturro', 'was', 'great', 'usual', 'again', 'believe', 'material', 'just', 'got', 'tired', 'end.Zohan', 'dream', 'get', 'counter-terrorist', 'trade', 'hair', 'dressing', 'got', '1980s', 'Paul', 'Mitchell', 'style', 'book', 'studied', 'years', 'date', 'desire', 'all-encompassing', 'final', 'battle', 'Phantom', 'Zohan', 'own', 'death', 'United', 'States', 'attempt', 'achieve', 'dream.Once', 'US', 'Zohan', 'up', 'guy', 'named', 'Michael', 'Scrappy', 'Coco', 'up', 'living', 'Michael', 'Unfortunately', 'also', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'Michael', 'mom', 'Michael', 'totally', 'distressed', 'bits', 'are', 'funny', 'keep', 'movie', 'rolling', 'along', 'just', 'fail', 'engage', 'superficial', 'level.Then', 'romantic', 'twist', 'working', 'Dhalia', 'style', 'shop', 'Zohan', 'haircuts', 'older', 'women', 'neighborhood', 'up', 'taking', 'sex', 'back', 'room', 'Nothing', 'bizarre', 'behavior', 'why', 'Zohan', 'felt', 'had', 'provide', 'performances', 'become', 'legendary', 'fill', 'shop', 'clients', 'Ultimately', 'shop', 'predacious', 'attentions', 'Walbridge', 'Industries', 'blatant', 'stab', 'Wal-Mart', 'interesting', 'so', 'many', 'Sandler', 'movies', 'are', 'sold', 'department', 'stores', '.The', 'movie', 'shifts', 'gears', 'so', 'rapidly', 'cameos', 'Mariah', 'Carey', 'subplot', 'involving', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'Palestinian', 'who', 'lost', 'goat', 'Zohan', 'only', 'level', 'props', 'gags', 'Even', 'romance', 'Dhalia', 'Emmanuelle', 'Chriqui', 'lost', 'mish-mash.As', 'stated', 'Sandler', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'happy', 'regular', 'moviegoers', 'lured', 'well-constructed', 'trailer', 'might', 'be', 'somewhat', 'disappointed', ""n't"", 'comic', 'James', 'Bond', 'movie', 'chain', 'gags', 'hit', 'miss', 'irregularity']",N/A

1182494,ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,B001DPHD9C,Micheal Hunt,"[1, 3]","I wasn't jumping up and down in anticipation waiting to see this, I pretty much got dragged along to it by friends.Judging from the trailer, I expected it to be pretty much the average Adam Sandler/Happy Madison kind of flick with PG rated comedy that has been done to death and all the stupid gags you usually get in these type of movies.However, it was pretty much all what you expect, but as well as a few over the top gags that got a few good laughs.Adam Sandler plays the Zohan. An Israeli Army soldier who is that typical James Bond type of soldier, you know, that best of the best, #1 at everything, has the charm, the charisma the women and the moves to take out an entire group of terrorists with just his fighting skills only.However the Zohan is sick of saving the day, and has all his doubts about all the fighting and killing, and so he fakes his own death to escape to America where he wants to live out his dream... a hair stylest.He comes to America and makes some friends and lands a job in a hair salon where he is first hired to clean the floors, but once given the chance, he proves to be quite the stylist giving women pleasure from the hair cuts and styles and then some.While he his trying to not be noticed as the Zohan, Rob Schnieder is playing another Israeli character who recognizes him and puts a plan together to hand him over the the bad guy, The Phantom.You can guess where it's going through the hole movie, its not much of an original plot, but it's not to say it's bad or anything, these comedies are just made for entertainment value and laughs.surprisingly I was able to forget that it was even Adam playing this character. Tho a lot of it is cheesy and sometimes lame, it's not the same old character you see Adam play most of the time.... so I guess being able to forget it's Adam and actually beleive in this character, well, i suppose it's ok to say he's done a good job on this character that separates it from the typical characters he often plays.For the people who are familiar with the Happy Madison team, you may be surprised that most of the actors you usually get are not in this one. Rob Shneider and that guy from SNL that I can never remember his name, but was the guy giving Adam advice in Happy Gilmore (you're too good for you home ball?""... as well as Chris Rock, but the usual gang don't seem to be there surprisingly. If they where, good job at hiding them under make up.The film also has a message about Israeli people and Palestinian differences that makes a bit of fun of what happens between them, but in the end, shows fighting and war proves nothing, and we should all just get along and help each other.Some of the comedy as I said was very lame, expected from these kind of movies, however there are some pretty decent laughs for the adults too.Just keep in mind that this is a PG rated movie from Sandler, so don't expect it to be as good as some of the other Happy Madison movies that are classified as 15/17/18 unrated etc...I don't see this as being one of the most memorable movies Happy Madison have produced, and far from the funniest, but it is OK for what you would expect it to be. It's not Happy Gilmore, far from Bill Madison, and not as much entertainment as Water Boy, and it's not going for the style of Wedding Singer or 50 First Dates... it's more something in the area of Click or the movies they did for Rob Shnider without the main character playing a loser in some kind of way.See it if you like Happy Madisons PG rated films, but don't expect it to be much more then the humor you see in the trailer.

Faking his death, while fighting his Palestinian arch enemy ""The Phantom"" (played by John Turturro), Zohan heads for America to fulfill his dream of remaking 1980's hairstyles all the rage. Dressed like a ""disco-dancer"", Zohan sets out to make women beautiful while also pleasuring them, hence working his magic. Eventually Zohan falls in love with his Boss; helps a community to realize that they should set their differences aside and stand up to a greedy land developer who wants their property to build a mega mall; faces a person (played by Rob Schneider) whose goat he once stole to humiliate him; and battles his arch enemy who he realizes he has more in common with than he once thought (Phantom wants to sell shoes).

1182496,A1MB5HUA3WYEJC,B001DPHD9C,"Mike ""Movie Buff""","[2, 4]","Wow was this raunchy. I guess going to see the movie thinking of The Wedding Singer and Click, I wasn't expecting much. I saw the movie on Saturday and the theatre was packed. Everyone was laughing hysterically. You get a naked Adam Sandler (although I'm guessing it's a body double and sock stuffing), Lainie Kazan's rear end exposed and lots of sex with old women. The beginning certainly gets it going! But it doesn't stop there......Adam Sandler is Zohan, a Mossadd agent (Israel's version of the C.I.A.) who is getting tired of being activated for an assignment, capturing a terrorist and then learning that he was released for a prisioner exchange. Zohan clearly is getting tired when he goes in to capture Phantom (John Tutturo) who was orginally captured but then released for an exchange. Lets not forget the ""weird"" almost superpowers that Zohan seems to have. He can leap from buildings, put people into pretzel holds, paddle a grenade, and in one instance he uses his feet to subdue an irate driver who got into an accident (the feet scene is funny).Sandler's Zohan, sees an opportunity to fake his death so he can go to the United States to fullfill his dream of becoming a hair stylist making peoples hair silky smooth. He originally tries to see Paul Mitchell for a job then goes elsewhere. How many people have gone to the Trump Tower to talk to Mr. Trump? He seems to think that Paul Mitchell would WANT TO SEE HIM. After a few tries he ends up at a struggling hair saloon run by a Paletinian-American named Dalia (played by the incredibly beautiful Emmanuelle Chriqui (Claire from Snow Day) who is getting hit with large rent bills because of the new owner of the land. Anyway, Zohan originally is a sweeper but then luck has it, he becomes a hair stylist. Zohan learns that Dalia's shop is threatened by a corporate real estate developer looking to create a mall in the location of her hair saloon as well as others along the street where the saloon is located. Dalia's store sees an influx of middle aged women as Zohan's way of cutting hair includes a good romp in the closet after he creates a 80's style haircut for them. As word gets out, there are lines around the corner. Something happens though, his oooomph is gone. Zohan realizes that he has fallen for Dalia and can no longer ""perform."" He wonders if it will work or if she likes him as he reveals he is an Israeli. Dalia had mentioned that she believes in peace and love for everyone.Back to the real estate developer. I never thought Michael Buffer (Lets Get Ready tooooooo Ruuuuuumble) would be casted as the evil land developer- Walbridge. Phantom even comes to the United States to open fast food resturants. Rob Schnieder makes an appearance (as a taxi driver) who blows Zohan's cover as he is not known as Zohan in the United States. Schnieder's character is upset at Zohan because he stole his goats.Michael Buffer's Walbridge, tries to take over all the stores along the street were Dalia's hair soloon is located. The rent is constantly raised. He devises a scheme to take over all the stores were on one side, stores are owned by Israeli's and the other by Palestinians. With Adam Sandler you can understand where most of the jokes are centered on. I'm not going to go into politics or say, this or that, but towards the end, Sandler tries to show peace, tolerance, and what happens when we work together instead of fighting. Is the movie one-sided. Yeah.So many immigrant jokes, jokes about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and jokes on the Arab-Israeli conflict. Some may be turned off to this. I honestly can say that my eyes were tearing with the amount of laughs in the movie. Sandler really goes far in this one. If you are an Adam Sandler fan you will like the movie. If ranchy comedies you'll probably not like this movie. It would be nice that when this movie comes out on DVD, that there are deleted scenes and funny outakes. There were no funny outakes during the closing credits.",4,This is not your average Adam Sandler movie but it's hillarious!,1212969600,"06 9, 2008",2008,3983,"['Wow', 'was', 'raunchy', 'guess', 'going', 'see', 'movie', 'thinking', 'Wedding', 'Singer', 'Click', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'saw', 'movie', 'Saturday', 'theatre', 'was', 'packed', 'Everyone', 'was', 'laughing', 'hysterically', 'get', 'naked', 'Adam', 'Sandler', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'body', 'double', 'sock', 'stuffing', 'Lainie', 'Kazan', 'rear', 'end', 'exposed', 'lots', 'sex', 'old', 'women', 'beginning', 'certainly', 'going', ""n't"", 'stop', 'there', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Zohan', 'Mossadd', 'agent', 'Israel', 'version', 'C.I.A', 'who', 'getting', 'tired', 'being', 'activated', 'assignment', 'capturing', 'terrorist', 'then', 'learning', 'was', 'released', 'prisioner', 'exchange', 'Zohan', 'clearly', 'getting', 'tired', 'when', 'capture', 'Phantom', 'John', 'Tutturo', 'who', 'was', 'orginally', 'captured', 'then', 'released', 'exchange', 'not', 'forget', 'weird', 'almost', 'superpowers', 'Zohan', 'have', 'can', 'leap', 'buildings', 'put', 'people', 'pretzel', 'paddle', 'grenade', 'one', 'instance', 'feet', 'subdue', 'irate', 'driver', 'who', 'got', 'accident', 'feet', 'scene', 'funny', '.Sandler', 'Zohan', 'opportunity', 'fake', 'death', 'can', 'go', 'United', 'States', 'fullfill', 'dream', 'becoming', 'hair', 'stylist', 'making', 'peoples', 'hair', 'silky', 'smooth', 'originally', 'see', 'Paul', 'Mitchell', 'job', 'then', 'elsewhere', 'How', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'gone', 'Trump', 'Tower', 'talk', 'Mr.', 'Trump', 'think', 'Paul', 'Mitchell', 'would', 'WANT', 'TO', 'SEE', 'HIM', 'few', 'tries', 'up', 'struggling', 'hair', 'saloon', 'run', 'Paletinian-American', 'named', 'Dalia', 'played', 'incredibly', 'beautiful', 'Emmanuelle', 'Chriqui', 'Claire', 'Snow', 'Day', 'who', 'getting', 'hit', 'large', 'rent', 'bills', 'new', 'owner', 'land', 'Anyway', 'Zohan', 'originally', 'sweeper', 'then', 'luck', 'hair', 'stylist', 'Zohan', 'Dalia', 'shop', 'threatened', 'corporate', 'real', 'estate', 'developer', 'looking', 'create', 'mall', 'location', 'hair', 'saloon', 'as', 'well', 'others', 'street', 'where', 'saloon', 'located', 'Dalia', 'store', 'influx', 'middle', 'aged', 'women', 'Zohan', 'way', 'cutting', 'hair', 'good', 'romp', 'closet', '80', 'style', 'haircut', 'word', 'out', 'are', 'lines', 'corner', 'Something', 'oooomph', 'gone', 'Zohan', 'fallen', 'Dalia', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'perform', 'will', 'work', 'Israeli', 'Dalia', 'had', 'mentioned', 'peace', 'love', 'everyone.Back', 'real', 'estate', 'developer', 'never', 'thought', 'Michael', 'Buffer', 'Lets', 'Get', 'Ready', 'tooooooo', 'Ruuuuuumble', 'would', 'be', 'casted', 'evil', 'land', 'developer-', 'Walbridge', 'Phantom', 'even', 'United', 'States', 'open', 'fast', 'food', 'resturants', 'Rob', 'Schnieder', 'appearance', 'taxi', 'driver', 'who', 'Zohan', 'cover', 'not', 'known', 'Zohan', 'United', 'States', 'Schnieder', 'character', 'upset', 'Zohan', 'stole', 'goats.Michael', 'Buffer', 'Walbridge', 'take', 'over', 'stores', 'street', 'were', 'Dalia', 'hair', 'soloon', 'located', 'rent', 'constantly', 'raised', 'scheme', 'take', 'over', 'stores', 'were', 'one', 'side', 'stores', 'are', 'owned', 'Israeli', 'other', 'Palestinians', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'can', 'understand', 'where', 'most', 'jokes', 'are', 'centered', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'go', 'politics', 'say', 'end', 'Sandler', 'show', 'peace', 'tolerance', 'what', 'when', 'work', 'together', 'instead', 'fighting', 'movie', 'one-sided', 'Yeah.So', 'many', 'immigrant', 'jokes', 'jokes', 'Palestinian-Israeli', 'conflict', 'jokes', 'Arab-Israeli', 'conflict', 'may', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'honestly', 'can', 'say', 'eyes', 'were', 'tearing', 'amount', 'laughs', 'movie', 'Sandler', 'really', 'far', 'one', 'are', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'fan', 'will', 'like', 'movie', 'ranchy', 'comedies', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'not', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'when', 'movie', 'out', 'DVD', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'funny', 'outakes', 'were', 'funny', 'outakes', 'closing', 'credits']",N/A

Adam Sandler's new comedy is shameless in its eagerness to extract laughs from every possible breach of taste or decorum, and why am I even mentioning taste and decorum in this context? This is a mighty hymn of and to vulgarity, and either you enjoy it, or you don't. I found myself enjoying it a surprising amount of the time, even though I was thoroughly ashamed of myself. There is a tiny part of me that still applauds the great minds who invented the whoopee cushion.Sandler plays an ace agent for the Mossad, the Israeli secret police; he has no interest in counter-terrorism and spends as much time as possible hanging out with babes on the beach. Known as the Zohan, he has remarkable physical skills -- and equipment, as his bikini briefs and the crotches of all his costumes make abundantly clear. The laws of gravity do not limit him; he can travel through cities like Spider-Man but without the web strings. He can simply jump for hundreds of feet.The Zohan harbors one secret desire. He wants to be a hairdresser. His equivalent of pornography is an old Paul Mitchell catalog, and one day he simply cuts his ties with Israel and smuggles himself into the United States in a crate carrying two dogs whose hair he does en route. In America, he poses as an Australian with a very peculiar accent, and when asked for his name, combines the names of his airborne flight buddies: Scrappy Coco. His auditions in various hair salons are unsuccessful (in a black salon, he attacks a dreads wig as if it were a hostile animal), until finally he is hired by the beautiful Dalia (Emmanuelle Chriqui), a Palestinian.This plot is simply the skeleton for sight gags. Early on, we saw how much pain he could endure when he dropped a sharp-toothed fish into the crotch of his bikini swimming trunks. Now we see such sights as his sexual adventures with old ladies in the salon. In my notes, I scribbled in the dark: &#34;An angel with the flexibility of a circus freak,&#34; adding, &#34;he tells old lady,&#34; although maybe the old lady told him. At home with a new friend (Rob Schneider as an Arab cabdriver), he effortlessly seduces the friend's mother (the zaftig Lainie Kazan).His archenemy, the Palestinian agent known as the Phantom (John Turturro), is also in New York, and they make war. The Phantom's training regime is severe. He takes eggs, cracks them and live chicks emerge. These he puts in a glass and chugs. He punches not only sides of beef but a living cow. Like the Zohan, he is filled with confidence in his own abilities, and with reason (he can cling to ceilings). Their confrontation will be a battle of the Middle-Eastern superheroes.Now creeps in a belated plot, involving a shady developer (Michael Buffer, of &#34;let's get ready to rumble!&#34; fame). He wants to tear down a street of Arab and Israeli electronics stores and falafel and hummus shops to put up a mall. This would be a terrible thing, particularly given the prominent role that hummus plays in the film. Opposition to the mall unites the Israelis and Arabs, unconvincingly, on the way to peace and brotherhood at the end.There are scenes here that make you wince. One involves a savage game of hacky-sack using not a hacky-sack bag but a living cat. Only the consolation that it's done with special effects allows us to endure the cries of the cat. Mariah Carey appears, starts to sing &#34;The Star-Spangled Banner&#34; and somehow survives a cameo with the mall builder. (Maybe his contract stipulates that Buffer must appear in all movies involving the National Anthem.) And something must be said about the Zohan's speech, which in addition to the broad comic accent, involves the word &#34;no&#34; in a series that can run from two (&#34;no-no!&#34;) to his usual five (&#34;no-no-no-no-no!&#34;) to the infinite.Sandler works so hard at this, and so shamelessly, that he battered down my resistance.

He arranged to fake his death and move to America where he will follow his dream of ... being a stylist!The picture is a real hoot, but every other scene is a crotch joke.  Sandler seems to appreciate much older women and after some false starts manages to get a job in a salon run by a beautiful palistenian.  Sandler is not only a superhero but apparently is on automatic as his prowness with every old lady in sight creates lines at the shop, but unlike Nathan Lane or Zero Mostel characters inThe Producers (Widescreen Edition)andThe Producers (Deluxe Edition)he actually likes these women.  The constant sex and jokes about his crotch and what it contains was a bit much and I was surprised at seeing parents in that movie with 12-13 year old girls.  It was funny but didn't belong with that age group.  It will be interesting to see the DVD release just to see what was cut to manage that PG-13 rating.It also took away from a lot of the actual humor that was very well written concerning Islamic Terror and the contrast in New York where in this movie the Arab and Jews  operate shops just accross the street from each other.You can't have Adam Sandler without Rob Schnider who plays an arab taxi cab driver who recognizes him and has sworn revenge for the abduction of his prize goat (trust me on this it works).  John Turturo is great as the Phantom and both he and Sandler play their characters so over the top that you can't help but like it.The villian in the end is a real cop-out and leads to the can't we all get along message.  A real treasure would be a prequel that couldn't help  but to be politically incorrect but then again the characters are SO over the top in general I don't know if it would be funny a 2nd time.

Instead, I only got stupidity.The overall storyline would neither make nor break the movie -- a super agent fakes his own death to pursue a less violent life; in the end, him and his former enemy have to team up to stop the bad guys, plus he gets the girl. Typical goofy plot that had potential to be really funny or really lame. Sadly, Sandler settled for really lame.Aside from a horde of terrible jokes and failed attempts at humorous situations, the movie's simplistic look at the situation -- like the rest of the movie -- fell short of funny and settled for stupid.Not to be unfair -- there were a few jokes that had me laughing, but a very few. The movie did seem to take shots of Palestinians and Israelis pretty equally, despite many comments that claimed otherwise. The movie thrived on stereotypes, some of which were funny, but most of which -- you guessed it -- failed miserably. And, of course, the ""best"" part of the movie was the whole ""let's just be nice to each other and all will be well"" theme. It would have been so much better to have avoided that altogether, and just had the Phantom and Zohan and the US Arab and Israeli communities patch up their differences than to attempt to apply the 'solution' to real life; it's just too absurd to be funny at that point. Not to get too political, but anyone who knows anything about the situation knows that a large portion of one side wants the other side completely exterminated, and ""holding hands"" simply isn't going to fix that...The story ends with Zohan and the Phantom's sister ending up together (with the Phantom's blessing) -- a nice, idealistic, symbolic union of Palestinians and Israelis. Too bad that, in real life, the girl would have been a victim of an 'honor killing' at her brother's hands...Oh, and, ironically enough, when I got back from seeing this film, I heard about a new Palestinian attack on Sderot.

(""50 First Dates"" comes to mind.)  However, it is a shame that he abuses his talents so effusively and intolerably as he does in ""You Don't Mess With the Zohan.""With the talents involved, this should have been a much greater movie.  In my opinion, even its frequent laughs and its flirting with an admirable ""Dropping of old hatreds/Peace in the Middle East"" theme, are not enough to redeem the serious base impurities in which this movie is so thoroughly steeped.The movie's premise is rich with promise:  THE premiere, elite Israeli commando fakes his own death in order to pursue his dream of becoming a peaceful hairdresser of all things!  The premise itself is worthy of a good laugh.  This caricature is largely well executed and, considered independently from the movie's flaws, exhibits a great comedic ability on the part of Mr. Sandler and others responsible for it.Unfortunately, the movie is also rampant with extreme, at times graphic, impurity and the banal scatological (bathroom) humor worthy of the most anal obsessive 8 year-old.  This style of humor unfortunately drowns out the far greater and more enjoyable humor of which Adam Sandler is capable, and even periodically displays in this movie.Furthermore, the sexual mores (actually, the lack thereof) in this movie are EXECRABLE.  The title character literally humps everything that moves in this movie (and a few things that don't).  Unfortunately, this statement is not a hyperbole.No character in this movie, male or female, seems to care--despite being completely aware--that the Zohan is having sex with LITERALLY every woman who will hold still long enough.  Even though at one point the Zohan flirts with the idea of monogamy, no one has enough dignity in their own person to even MAKE NOISES at requiring monogamy with them.All religious standards aside:  Are those who made this move COMPLETELY unaware of the rampant AIDS, hepatitis and other STD epidemics that have swept the world in the last 40-50 years since the sexual revolution?I am no prude.  In fact, as a Catholic Christian, I see and understand sexuality within marriage to be a GREAT gift from God.  As a physician I see and deal with a full range of human behaviors every day.  Unfortunately I also have to deal daily with the consequences of my patients' misbehaviors, frequently the misuses of the gift of sexuality.  I help patients deal with the ramifications of these abuses on a daily basis as well.  This movie is downright irresponsible in this regard, EVEN IF one takes the sexual misbehaviors of its characters as a hyperbole.An aside here, to Lainie Kazan and Charlotte Rae--WHAT WERE YOU THINKING (?) when you took your parts in this movie!  How far have you fallen?!  Shame on you!  You are both far, FAR better than this.  Stop it!I am sure that the preceding review will be deplored by many, and thus reduce my reviewer rating.

1182519,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B001DPHD9C,RMurray847,"[1, 2]","I have to admit that I'm not a huge Adam Sandler fan.  I get very tired of his mentally-challenged man/child bit (THE WATERBOY is a prime example of this work that does NOT work for me).  Yet the previews for YOU DON'T MESS WITH THE ZOHAN were actually quite funny...and they showed Sandler being confident...heck, overly confident.So I settled into my theatre seat, anticipating something a little better that usual from Sandler, and for about 60 minutes, that's what I got.Zohan is an Israeli counter-terrorism specialist.  Heck, he's practically a superhero, able to accomplish missions that 20 trained soldiers couldn't pull off.  He catches bullets in his nose, swims with the speed of a dolphin and can leap across tall buildings in a single bound.  Yet, when off duty, he enjoys disco and barbequing in the nude (don't ask).  He's popular with the ladies, and is an all-around good guy.  This was actually a Sandler I could enjoy.  He beefed up a little for the role, and is wearing some great curly hair and a beard.  Honestly, he's actually pretty convincing in what is after all, a silly part.  I laughed A LOT at his early antics in Israel, enjoying Zohan's love for life and ridiculous action moves.But Zohan yearns to leave the conflict behind, move to America, and be a hair-stylist.  When he tells his parents, and his father mocks him as a ""fagola,"" Zohan makes the decision to stage his own death and travel to the US.  He arrives with a new name, Scrappy Coco (again, don't ask), ready to take Paul Mitchell salons by storm.  You see, for years, his prize possession has been a Paul Mitchell hair style ""catalog.""  Sadly, the book is more than a decade out of date, so his ideas of great hair don't quite match current standards.He lands a gig sweeping up in a Palestinian run salon, and eventually is allowed to cut hair.  Turns out, he is particularly appealing to the older clientele, because somehow, he has an insatiable sex drive, and is able to make all these older women feel sexy again.I've told you a lot about the plot, but no specifics, I think.  It's the WAY in which he gets from Point A to Point B that are fun...find out for yourself.However, a little past midway...quite a while past the point where I'd stopped marveling that I was really enjoying a Sandler movie...the film fell flat.  I can't pinpoint the exact moment, but it was probably around the time Zohan realizes he's fallen in love.  Sandler suddenly went into his shy, awkward shtick again, AND the film started to try making statements about Israeli/Palestinian relations.  (Frankly, the movie actually does a nice job of showing how in America, these two ""warring"" factions had absolutely no reason to hate or fight each other, and in fact, got along fairly genially.  I was surprised at the relative maturity of this outlook.)  Near the end, I realized it had been a LONG time since I'd laughed.  The love-story was unconvincing, to put it mildly and the climactic scenes were uninspired and boring.  John Torturro, normally the best thing in a Sandler movie, was somewhat lost in his over-the-top role as Zohan's longtime arch-enemy.  Rob Schneider, in offensively stereotyped ""Arab"" makeup, was unfunnier than usual.So for me, when the closing credits started running, I was left with mixed feelings.  I had laughed a lot...but it seemed like a long time ago.  The movie soared for a long time, and then came crashing to earth with a clumsy thud.  I feel director Dennis Dugan must take a lot of the blame...he has no visual imagination, and a terrible sense of pace...but the script is also to blame by trying to force this wacky premise into a rom-com mold, and the forcing THAT mold to fit into some kind of action movie mold.  The molds all just broke as a result.If you're a Sandler fan, I guess you'll enjoy this more than I did.  If you're not...then I think there's a good chance you'll feel like me...disappointed at the opportunity missed.(By the way, the film is rated ""PG-13,"" but the sexual undertones...and NOT so under...really make this film an ""R"" in my book.

I know this is a negative way to start any review but this really was a terrible film, even by Adam Sandler's standards! When I saw the trailer I thought, hmmm Israeli secret agent gives up career to be hairdresser in New York, should be good for some laughs. Sadly the funniest part of the film was the first ten minutes when he was an agent in Israel and the rest of the film was excruciatingly terrible. Zohan's accent is meant to be Israeli but it sounds more French the whole way through, the use of one joke throughout (I.e. the Israeli's love of Hummus) wore thin VERY quickly, some of the jokes could be classed as mildly racist at best and downright offensive depending on your take and sensibilities and the use of crass humour to raise a laugh clearly insults the audiences intelligence. I could go on but this film has very little to redeem itself and the people that feel this explains the middle east conflict in 2 `humorous' hours are severely deluded. From expecting some easy going entertainment I was hugely disappointed and I do enjoy silly, tongue in cheek films like the rest of us, but this had very little humour and plenty of cringe making scenes and plotline.

I can honestly say that I belong to the latter group.You already know the premise of the film: Sandler is Zohan, a killing machine who works for the Israeli army fighting his arch Palestinian nemesis the ""Fantom"", played remarkably by John Turturro. However, the Zohan has grown weary and bored of the same old eldless fight, and he aspires to be hairdresser in spite of his parents' mockery.He fakes his death, and escapes to New York, hiding in a cage with two dogs, Scrappy and Coco, on an airplane. Upon arriving to the Big Apple, Zohan adopts the name Scrappy Coco and ends up working for a beautiful Palestinian hairdresser.I just realized that I've just tirelessly summarized the first act of the movie, a movie that is so silly, it's dead-on funny as hell!It's true Adam's immature movie roles have gotten old, but he can still pull off acting stupid in a blink of an eye, or a snip of a pair of scissors.Watch out for hilarious appearances by Rob Schneider, musician Dave Matthews, Kevin James, and singer Mariah Carey.RecommendedB+",4,Sandler can still pull off acting stupid!,1244073600,"06 4, 2009",2009,1311,"['negative', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'read', 'amazon', 'regarding', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'most', 'recent', 'comedy', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Mess', 'Zohan', ""'ve"", 'discovered', 'Sandler', 'cowriter/producer', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'have', 'successfully', 'created', 'cult', 'comedy', 'one', 'hate', 'love', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'belong', 'latter', 'group.You', 'already', 'know', 'premise', 'film', 'Sandler', 'Zohan', 'killing', 'machine', 'who', 'Israeli', 'army', 'fighting', 'arch', 'Palestinian', 'nemesis', 'Fantom', 'played', 'remarkably', 'John', 'Turturro', 'However', 'Zohan', 'grown', 'weary', 'bored', 'same', 'old', 'eldless', 'fight', 'be', 'hairdresser', 'spite', 'parents', 'mockery.He', 'death', 'escapes', 'New', 'York', 'hiding', 'cage', 'two', 'dogs', 'Scrappy', 'Coco', 'airplane', 'arriving', 'Big', 'Apple', 'Zohan', 'name', 'Scrappy', 'Coco', 'up', 'working', 'beautiful', 'Palestinian', 'hairdresser.I', 'just', 'realized', ""'ve"", 'just', 'tirelessly', 'summarized', 'first', 'act', 'movie', 'movie', 'so', 'silly', 'dead-on', 'funny', 'hell', 'true', 'Adam', 'immature', 'movie', 'roles', 'have', 'gotten', 'old', 'can', 'still', 'pull', 'off', 'acting', 'stupid', 'blink', 'eye', 'snip', 'pair', 'scissors.Watch', 'hilarious', 'appearances', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'musician', 'Dave', 'Matthews', 'Kevin', 'James', 'singer', 'Mariah', 'Carey.RecommendedB+']",N/A

His off the wall, perverse humor is okay for a little while, but can quickly grate on your nerves.  Generally speaking, his performance in this film is just okay.  He plays a James Bond inspired Mossad agent who fakes his death so that he can become a hairstylist in New York.  He is forced out of ""retirement"" when a low life business guy wants to mow down the neighborhood he's working in to build a new mall.  This also bring out of the woodwork his archenemy well played by John Turturro and another enemy hysterically played by Rob Schneider.  The supporting cast is terrific including the still funny and radiant Lanie Kazan, a cameo by Mariah Carey, and the absolutely stunning and believable Emmanuelle Chriqui, who was born in Montreal, Quebec, to Jewish French Moroccan immigrants of Sephardic Moroccan descent.  She has a rich varied background and plays Sandler's Palestinian love interest.The film, in pieces, has many very funny and memorable moments and even a few touching ones, but as a whole, the film is weak.  Yes, I know it's a comedy and not meant to be taken seriously and, yes, I know that it's a satire too, which is a unique brand of comedy that pokes fun at our human faults, but these genres alone don't make the movie funnier or enhance the weak plot or change the fact that numerous redundant jokes get stale by their 14th run through.I liked this movie enough overall to give it three stars, but it is not all it could have been and it's my first real disappointment for the summer as I expected more from this film.

1182542,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B001DPHD9C,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[1, 1]","Once upon a time Adam Sandler used to be a very funny comedian.  He was on Saturday Night Live back in the day of its 2nd Renaissance when the group could be funny without having to mock politicians all the time.  He had some hilarious comedy albums and he made some very funny movies, e.g. HAPPY GILMORE, BILLY MADISON, and THE WATERBOY.  Maybe it's because he's gotten older, but Sandler's movies just aren't as funny as they used to be and YOU DON'T MESS WITH THE ZOHAN is one of the worst he's ever made (it's right next to LITTLE NICKY) and will probably get several 2008 Razzie nominations.The movie centers around one Zohan Dvir (Adam Sandler).  Zohan is the top super soldier of the Israeli army.  Sometimes his methods are questionable, but no one questions his results.  Zohan is very good at what he does: fighting terrorists, mainly Palestinians.  He is well respected and well paid for the work he does.  But Zohan is tired of being a killer and dreams of coming to the United States and becoming a hair dresser.  So, when he is assigned to fight his nemesis, who is just known as The Phantom (John Turturro), Zohan fakes his own death and travels to the U.S.A. to fulfill his dream. After being rejected from the big styling studios, he eventually finds work in a small beauty salon owned by a beautiful Palestinian woman named Dalia (Emmanuelle Chriqui).  Zohan soon becomes a sensation by pampering the older, mature, and sometimes very mature women who visit the salon and taking them into the backroom to give them ""the sticky"". Surprisingly, he's also a decent stylist for those looking for a retro mid-1970s or early 1980s look.  Zohan is smitten with Dalia, but she is Palestinian and he is an Israeli.There are some scenes in YOU DON'T MESS WITH THE ZOHAN that are hilarious and show a spark of the comic genius that Sandler used to have in all of his movies.  One-liner and dirty jokes also abound in the Hebrew and Arabic languages that are used intermittently throughout the movie.  But most people don't know any Hebrew or Arabic and the very funny scenes are quite rare.  Most of the time the movie seems to be making the same joke over and over and over and over.  I felt like Sandler and company thought that if the joke was funny the first time then it has to be hilarious the 50th time and if you didn't find it funny they were going to force you to find it funny by beating you over the head with it.  There's also a lot in the film that is very crude and at times almost raunchy.  While I'm not disturbed by a little of that humor, the overkill was just too much.  When I first saw the movie, I went with my one brother who is a huge Adam Sandler fan and owns every movie and DVD that's available with Sandler in it.  Even he said the movie was his least favorite Sandler movie and groaned several times while watching the movie.YOU DON'T MESS WITH THE ZOHAN actually has parts that are full of satire about stereotyping, race relations, conflict in the Middle East, etc.  These are important issues that should be addressed and the basic ""plot"" of the movie provides a perfect set-up for doing that.  Unfortunately, the satire is drowned and buried in other attempts at what is supposed to be humor.",2,Read the Title of the Movie and Let It Be,1224806400,"10 24, 2008",2008,3233,"['Once', 'time', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'used', 'be', 'very', 'funny', 'comedian', 'was', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'back', 'day', '2nd', 'Renaissance', 'when', 'group', 'could', 'be', 'funny', 'having', 'mock', 'politicians', 'time', 'had', 'hilarious', 'comedy', 'albums', 'made', 'very', 'funny', 'movies', 'e.g', 'HAPPY', 'GILMORE', 'BILLY', 'MADISON', 'WATERBOY', 'Maybe', 'gotten', 'older', 'Sandler', 'movies', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'funny', 'used', 'be', 'YOU', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'MESS', 'WITH', 'THE', 'ZOHAN', 'one', 'worst', 'ever', 'made', 'right', 'next', 'LITTLE', 'NICKY', 'will', 'probably', 'get', 'several', '2008', 'Razzie', 'nominations.The', 'movie', 'centers', 'one', 'Zohan', 'Dvir', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Zohan', 'top', 'super', 'soldier', 'Israeli', 'army', 'Sometimes', 'methods', 'are', 'questionable', 'one', 'questions', 'results', 'Zohan', 'very', 'good', 'what', 'fighting', 'terrorists', 'mainly', 'Palestinians', 'well', 'respected', 'well', 'paid', 'work', 'Zohan', 'tired', 'being', 'killer', 'dreams', 'coming', 'United', 'States', 'becoming', 'hair', 'dresser', 'So', 'when', 'assigned', 'fight', 'nemesis', 'who', 'just', 'known', 'Phantom', 'John', 'Turturro', 'Zohan', 'own', 'death', 'travels', 'U.S.A.', 'fulfill', 'dream', 'being', 'rejected', 'big', 'styling', 'studios', 'eventually', 'work', 'small', 'beauty', 'salon', 'owned', 'beautiful', 'Palestinian', 'woman', 'named', 'Dalia', 'Emmanuelle', 'Chriqui', 'Zohan', 'soon', 'sensation', 'pampering', 'older', 'mature', 'sometimes', 'very', 'mature', 'women', 'who', 'visit', 'salon', 'taking', 'backroom', 'give', 'sticky', 'Surprisingly', 'also', 'decent', 'stylist', 'looking', 'retro', 'mid-1970s', 'early', '1980s', 'look', 'Zohan', 'smitten', 'Dalia', 'Palestinian', 'Israeli.There', 'are', 'scenes', 'YOU', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'MESS', 'WITH', 'THE', 'ZOHAN', 'are', 'hilarious', 'show', 'spark', 'comic', 'genius', 'Sandler', 'used', 'have', 'movies', 'One-liner', 'dirty', 'jokes', 'also', 'abound', 'Hebrew', 'Arabic', 'are', 'used', 'intermittently', 'movie', 'most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Hebrew', 'Arabic', 'very', 'funny', 'scenes', 'are', 'quite', 'rare', 'Most', 'time', 'movie', 'be', 'making', 'same', 'joke', 'felt', 'Sandler', 'company', 'thought', 'joke', 'was', 'funny', 'first', 'time', 'then', 'be', 'hilarious', '50th', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'funny', 'were', 'going', 'force', 'find', 'funny', 'beating', 'head', 'also', 'lot', 'film', 'very', 'crude', 'times', 'almost', 'raunchy', ""'m"", 'not', 'disturbed', 'little', 'humor', 'overkill', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'went', 'one', 'brother', 'who', 'huge', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'fan', 'movie', 'DVD', 'available', 'Sandler', 'Even', 'said', 'movie', 'was', 'least', 'favorite', 'Sandler', 'movie', 'groaned', 'several', 'times', 'watching', 'movie.YOU', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'MESS', 'WITH', 'THE', 'ZOHAN', 'actually', 'parts', 'are', 'full', 'satire', 'stereotyping', 'race', 'relations', 'conflict', 'Middle', 'East', 'etc', 'are', 'important', 'issues', 'should', 'be', 'addressed', 'basic', 'plot', 'movie', 'perfect', 'set-up', 'doing', 'Unfortunately', 'satire', 'drowned', 'buried', 'other', 'attempts', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'humor']",N/A

If you are a heavy duty Adam Sandler fan, their is enough to leave you satisfied but a little sick.  I gave this film three stars on the gags alone, the rest of this film was at best lack luster. They try really hard to force feed this nonsense into out throats and it works but it leaves a bitter taste in your mouth.
