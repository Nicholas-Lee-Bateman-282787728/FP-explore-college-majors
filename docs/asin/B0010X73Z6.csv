1126615,A2BDZAU0Y4J6NB,B0010X73Z6,F. S. L'hoir,"[2, 2]","I cannot imagine this excellent television drama appealing to American audiences, unless they take an intense interest in British politics, and even then, they would be advised to read up on the background of the Thatcher Tory government and the rise of New Labour under the leadership of Tony Blair, and the incipient friendship and increasing rivalry between him and Gordon Brown. They would also be advised to switch on the subtitles, as the dialogue moves very quickly at times.Despite a second nuanced performance by the remarkable Michael Sheen, ""The Deal""--as another reviewer has observed--is far from being a 'prequel' to ""The Queen"". Nevertheless, director Stephen Frears has created a fascinating depiction of the two leaders who were to dominate British politics for thirteen years. He has also given us a glimpse into what, in Shakespeare's hands, might have been a single scene in one of his political tragedies.""The Deal"" presents Gordon Brown, beautifully portrayed by David Morrissey, as a man who is motivated politically by an earnest and zealous desire for reform; who holds the leadership of the Labour Party (and future as Prime Minister, if the party should ever come to power) as a cherished goal to be sought as a prize of honour. Fate intercedes in the form of the young, eager, charismatic and increasingly ambitious attorney, Tony Blair, whom the more politically experienced Brown befriends and mentors in the House of Commons. The director leaves Blair's motivations ambiguous though, only implying the moment when he decides to seize the power; whether he does so by chance or by design is left to the viewers to decide. David Morrissey's sensitive portrayal of Brown, however, reflects the wounded pride of a man who realises that his lifelong ambition is being usurped by an opportunist who values the party leadership only as a means to an end.The devil in ""The Deal"" is Peter Mandelson (aka ""The Prince of Darkness"" in political circles), MP and Party Spin Doctor, who, in a change of allegiance, chooses Blair's easy charm over Brown's difficult dourness as the most likely winning ticket from the Opposition to the Government side of the House of Commons. The tragedy comes in retrospect, because the viewer knows that although both men achieved their aims--first Blair, and eventually Brown--in the final estimation, the prize, which they each coveted so dearly, disintegrated, leaving their respective reputations in tatters.The subject of the dynamics of ambition, power and the role of the media is particularly relevant today, in light of the ongoing ""phone hacking"" scandal which is threatening to consume the political discourse in Great Britain, and has even had repercussions on this side of the Atlantic.",4,Devil's Deal,1311292800,"07 22, 2011",2011,2751,"['can', 'not', 'imagine', 'excellent', 'television', 'drama', 'appealing', 'American', 'audiences', 'take', 'intense', 'interest', 'British', 'politics', 'even', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'advised', 'read', 'up', 'background', 'Thatcher', 'Tory', 'government', 'rise', 'New', 'Labour', 'leadership', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'incipient', 'friendship', 'increasing', 'rivalry', 'Gordon', 'Brown', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'advised', 'switch', 'subtitles', 'dialogue', 'moves', 'very', 'quickly', 'times.Despite', 'second', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'remarkable', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'Deal', 'reviewer', 'observed', 'far', 'being', ""'prequel"", 'Queen', 'Nevertheless', 'director', 'Stephen', 'Frears', 'created', 'fascinating', 'depiction', 'two', 'leaders', 'who', 'were', 'dominate', 'British', 'politics', 'thirteen', 'years', 'also', 'given', 'glimpse', 'what', 'Shakespeare', 'hands', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'single', 'scene', 'one', 'political', 'tragedies', 'Deal', 'presents', 'Gordon', 'Brown', 'beautifully', 'portrayed', 'David', 'Morrissey', 'man', 'who', 'motivated', 'politically', 'earnest', 'zealous', 'desire', 'reform', 'who', 'leadership', 'Labour', 'Party', 'future', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'party', 'should', 'ever', 'come', 'power', 'cherished', 'goal', 'be', 'sought', 'prize', 'honour', 'Fate', 'intercedes', 'form', 'young', 'eager', 'charismatic', 'increasingly', 'ambitious', 'attorney', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'whom', 'more', 'politically', 'experienced', 'Brown', 'befriends', 'mentors', 'House', 'Commons', 'director', 'Blair', 'motivations', 'ambiguous', 'only', 'implying', 'moment', 'when', 'seize', 'power', 'so', 'chance', 'design', 'left', 'viewers', 'decide', 'David', 'Morrissey', 'sensitive', 'portrayal', 'Brown', 'however', 'wounded', 'pride', 'man', 'who', 'lifelong', 'ambition', 'being', 'usurped', 'opportunist', 'who', 'party', 'leadership', 'only', 'means', 'end.The', 'devil', 'Deal', 'Peter', 'Mandelson', 'Prince', 'Darkness', 'political', 'circles', 'MP', 'Party', 'Spin', 'Doctor', 'who', 'change', 'allegiance', 'Blair', 'easy', 'charm', 'Brown', 'difficult', 'dourness', 'most', 'likely', 'winning', 'ticket', 'Opposition', 'Government', 'side', 'House', 'Commons', 'tragedy', 'retrospect', 'viewer', 'men', 'achieved', 'aims', 'first', 'Blair', 'eventually', 'Brown', 'final', 'estimation', 'prize', 'coveted', 'so', 'dearly', 'disintegrated', 'leaving', 'respective', 'reputations', 'tatters.The', 'subject', 'dynamics', 'ambition', 'power', 'role', 'media', 'particularly', 'relevant', 'today', 'light', 'ongoing', 'phone', 'hacking', 'scandal', 'threatening', 'consume', 'political', 'discourse', 'Great', 'Britain', 'even', 'had', 'repercussions', 'side', 'Atlantic']",The Deal
1126616,A2ONZPPQ93TPQ9,B0010X73Z6,Gena Chereck,"[16, 16]","First of all, let me point out that The Deal is technically not a ""prequel"" to the Oscar-nominated 2006 film The Queen, since this was actually filmed and then aired on Britain's Channel 4 three years prior. Both were written by Peter Morgan and directed by Stephen Frears, and both star Welsh actor Michael Sheen as politician Tony Blair; and I suspect that, had it not been for the success of The Queen, The Deal most likely would not have seen a US release. Which would've been a shame, since The Deal -- though not quite the rich, in-depth character study that The Queen was -- is actually a sturdy little teleplay, and a fascinating glimpse into the workings of UK politics.The story concerns the friendship and rivalry between Members of Parliament Tony Blair and Gordon Brown as they worked their way up the ranks of the Labour Party throughout the 1980s and into the '90s (they were considered the ""opposition party"" as long as the Conservative Party was in power); when their party leader, John Smith, suddenly died in 1994, both Blair and Brown were poised to take over. Though the pair had been united in their desire to ""modernize"" the Labour Party and put it back in power, the shrewd and friendly Blair was becoming convinced that he would be a more likely Labour candidate than the passionate, intellectual Brown to beat the Conservative candidate in the next election. So they supposedly struck a deal wherein Blair would run as the Labour candidate for Prime Minister: If elected, he would in turn give Brown unprecedented power as Chancellor of the Exchequer, and then Blair would step down after his first term and let Brown take over as PM.The script portrays the duo's conflict a bit simplistically -- the eager-beaver pretty-boy versus the moody man-of-substance -- and it seems rather biased in favor of Brown, painting him as a victim of the harsh truth that it really does matter how much you can appeal to people when you're going for the ""top job."" But then there's only so much you can show in 80 minutes; and besides, both Sheen (as a somewhat less sympathetic Blair than he played in The Queen) and English actor David Morrissey (outstanding as Brown) do their darnedest to bring whatever nuance they can to their roles. It also helps that the story is fast-moving and occasionally witty, with few (if any) moments that drag.That said, the film doesn't spend much time explaining the characters' backgrounds or their political offices; fortunately, the DVD comes with brief text bios of Brown and Blair, as well as a charming 22-minute interview with Frears -- stuff I would recommend checking out before watching the movie itself. (NOTE: Though not rated, The Deal probably merits a PG-13 for a few instances of strong language.)",4,A superior made-for-TV movie,1237507200,"03 20, 2009",2009,2760,"['First', 'let', 'point', 'out', 'Deal', 'technically', 'not', 'prequel', 'Oscar-nominated', '2006', 'film', 'Queen', 'was', 'actually', 'filmed', 'then', 'aired', 'Britain', 'Channel', '4', 'three', 'years', 'prior', 'were', 'written', 'Peter', 'Morgan', 'directed', 'Stephen', 'Frears', 'star', 'Welsh', 'actor', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'politician', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'suspect', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'success', 'Queen', 'Deal', 'most', 'likely', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'seen', 'US', 'release', 'Which', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'shame', 'Deal', 'not', 'rich', 'in-depth', 'character', 'study', 'Queen', 'was', 'actually', 'sturdy', 'little', 'teleplay', 'fascinating', 'glimpse', 'workings', 'UK', 'politics.The', 'story', 'concerns', 'friendship', 'rivalry', 'Members', 'Parliament', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'Gordon', 'Brown', 'worked', 'way', 'ranks', 'Labour', 'Party', '1980s', ""'90s"", 'were', 'considered', 'opposition', 'party', 'as', 'long', 'Conservative', 'Party', 'was', 'power', 'when', 'party', 'leader', 'John', 'Smith', 'suddenly', 'died', '1994', 'Blair', 'Brown', 'were', 'poised', 'take', 'over', 'pair', 'had', 'been', 'united', 'desire', 'modernize', 'Labour', 'Party', 'put', 'back', 'power', 'shrewd', 'friendly', 'Blair', 'was', 'becoming', 'convinced', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'likely', 'Labour', 'candidate', 'passionate', 'intellectual', 'Brown', 'beat', 'Conservative', 'candidate', 'next', 'election', 'supposedly', 'struck', 'deal', 'wherein', 'Blair', 'would', 'run', 'Labour', 'candidate', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'elected', 'would', 'turn', 'give', 'Brown', 'unprecedented', 'power', 'Chancellor', 'Exchequer', 'then', 'Blair', 'would', 'step', 'down', 'first', 'term', 'let', 'Brown', 'take', 'over', 'PM.The', 'script', 'duo', 'conflict', 'bit', 'simplistically', 'eager-beaver', 'pretty-boy', 'moody', 'man-of-substance', 'rather', 'biased', 'favor', 'Brown', 'painting', 'victim', 'harsh', 'truth', 'really', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'can', 'appeal', 'people', 'when', ""'re"", 'going', 'top', 'job', 'then', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'can', 'show', '80', 'minutes', 'besides', 'Sheen', 'somewhat', 'less', 'sympathetic', 'Blair', 'played', 'Queen', 'English', 'actor', 'David', 'Morrissey', 'outstanding', 'Brown', 'do', 'darnedest', 'bring', 'nuance', 'can', 'roles', 'also', 'story', 'fast-moving', 'occasionally', 'witty', 'few', 'moments', 'drag.That', 'said', 'film', ""n't"", 'spend', 'much', 'time', 'explaining', 'characters', 'backgrounds', 'political', 'offices', 'fortunately', 'DVD', 'brief', 'text', 'bios', 'Brown', 'Blair', 'as', 'well', 'charming', '22-minute', 'interview', 'Frears', 'stuff', 'would', 'recommend', 'checking', 'out', 'watching', 'movie', 'NOTE', 'not', 'rated', 'Deal', 'probably', 'PG-13', 'few', 'instances', 'strong', 'language']",The Deal
