April plays a dumb ""white girl"" yet has smart moments where she catches on to what the first wife was doing. The argument in the kitchen could have been better from Aprils side. After all the woman tried to kill her baby!Ending was terrible. Bottomline is a happy marriage and a family is split up because of the selfishness of the first (and seemingly dead) wife.

 according to him, the hospital claimed no paperwork was ever signed.  with maxed-out credit cards and no paperwork, who paid?  it's unlikely that a hospital would allow a year's free ride for that kind of care.  there's also room in here for a funeral.  as her husband, marcus would have been involved in that.  it's as if he just said, ""i can't pay.  go ahead and pull the plug,"" and that was the end of his involvement.  these points should have been acknowledged and addressed.vivian's father, played by obba babatunde (i love that man!!!), died while she was hospitalized.  this fact only comes up when marcus is told that vivian has recovered from the coma and has nowhere to go.  it is never mentioned again, so there's no place for vivian to have a reaction to it.and another thing:  how does one get up from a long-term comatose state needing nothing more than a wheelchair to exit the hospital?  shouldn't there have been some physical therapy?  vivian bounced out of that chair as if she'd just been in to get an infected hangnail treated.  after Two Years.  and why couldn't the same girl who looked after her for those two years find her some clothes to wear?  she left the hospital decked out in the jacked up wedding dress she was wearing when the accident happened.then, there's the shoddy treatment of the pregnant new wife, jenny.  everyone participated in that shameful behavior.  this doesn't make much sense when it was she who suggested that they take vivian in.  because she comes across as goodhearted and generous but naive, the treatment seemed especially unwarranted.  the name-calling directed at her didn't help.  worse, almost all of it was about race.this movie is a tacky, tasteless farce and a waste of time and money.i can't help wondering if babatunde, an excellent actor, was relieved to have such a brief role in this train wreck of a flick.",1,stay away from it,1379030400,"09 13, 2013",2013,3522,"['ever', 'have', 'moment', 'when', 'see', 'something', 'horrible', 'happening', 'know', 'should', 'look', 'away', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'was', 'experience', 'movie.first', 'things', 'first', 'when', 'i', 'saw', 'cherie', 'johnson', 'was', 'knew', 'i', ""'d"", 'have', 'view', 'open', 'mind', 'woman', 'never', 'been', 'good', 'actor', 'i', 'am', 'not', 'saying', 'be', 'mean', 'just', 'fact', 'i', 'decided', 'lot', 'time', 'passed', 'i', 'last', 'saw', 'anything', 'i', ""'d"", 'give', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'perhaps', ""'d"", 'perfected', 'craft', 'i', 'was', 'johnson', 'not', 'least', 'movie', 'problems', 'may', 'be', 'responsible', 'more', 'most', 'involved', 'one', 'writers', 'writing', 'sux', 'loud', 'low-class', 'way', 'getting', 'man', 'back', 'cost', 'shar', 'jackson', ""i'll-cut-yo-ass"", 'ghetto', 'girl', 'act', 'made', 'flinch', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'start', 'out', 'class', 'act', 'end', 'That.now', 'plot', 'just', 'married', 'vivian', 'marcus', 'are', 'accident', 'leave', 'wedding', 'fine', 'next', 'two', 'years', 'coma', 'wakes', 'up', 'coma', 'husband', 'called', 'get', 'attitude', 'was', 'odd', 'why', 'would', 'man', 'who', 'so', 'love', 'beginning', 'end', 'see', 'recovery', 'need', 'care', 'burden', 'as', 'far', 'i', 'can', 'tell', 'vivian', 'never', 'given', 'explanation', 'why', 'marcus', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'see', 'second', 'year', 'was', 'told', 'handled', 'very', 'immature', 'manner', 'someone', 'else', 'pointed', 'out', 'how', 'life', 'support', 'marcus', 'could', 'no', 'longer', 'afford', 'allowed', 'continue', 'when', 'let', 'end', 'according', 'hospital', 'claimed', 'paperwork', 'was', 'ever', 'signed', 'maxed-out', 'credit', 'cards', 'paperwork', 'who', 'paid', 'unlikely', 'hospital', 'would', 'allow', 'year', 'free', 'ride', 'kind', 'care', 'also', 'room', 'here', 'funeral', 'husband', 'marcus', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'involved', 'just', 'said', 'i', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pay', 'go', 'ahead', 'pull', 'plug', 'was', 'end', 'involvement', 'points', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'acknowledged', 'addressed.vivian', 'father', 'played', 'obba', 'babatunde', 'i', 'love', 'man', 'died', 'was', 'hospitalized', 'fact', 'only', 'up', 'when', 'marcus', 'told', 'vivian', 'recovered', 'coma', 'nowhere', 'go', 'never', 'mentioned', 'again', 'place', 'vivian', 'have', 'reaction', 'it.and', 'thing', 'how', 'one', 'get', 'up', 'long-term', 'comatose', 'state', 'needing', 'nothing', 'more', 'wheelchair', 'exit', 'hospital', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'physical', 'therapy', 'vivian', 'bounced', 'chair', ""'d"", 'just', 'been', 'get', 'infected', 'hangnail', 'treated', 'Two', 'Years', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'same', 'girl', 'who', 'looked', 'two', 'years', 'find', 'clothes', 'wear', 'left', 'hospital', 'decked', 'out', 'jacked', 'up', 'wedding', 'dress', 'was', 'wearing', 'when', 'accident', 'happened.then', 'shoddy', 'treatment', 'pregnant', 'new', 'wife', 'jenny', 'everyone', 'participated', 'shameful', 'behavior', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'when', 'was', 'who', 'suggested', 'take', 'vivian', 'goodhearted', 'generous', 'naive', 'treatment', 'seemed', 'especially', 'unwarranted', 'name-calling', 'directed', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'worse', 'almost', 'was', 'race.this', 'movie', 'tacky', 'tasteless', 'farce', 'waste', 'time', 'money.i', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wondering', 'babatunde', 'excellent', 'actor', 'was', 'relieved', 'have', 'such', 'brief', 'role', 'train', 'wreck', 'flick']",I Do...I Did
