Why don't people take the time to look at the episode lists? Second the show is not scripted. They go out there and film these guys and edit how they want to. The Duck Commander folks even said they would like more of their ""realness"" so to speak to come out but they have no control in how A&E; edits things. Third these guys are not uneducated by any means. All the kids have degrees and so does Phil. Could any of you sitting here go out and do what Willy is doing and run that multi million dollar business? Don't think so.This show is good, clean fun.

Duck Dynasty is the exception.  It was quite by accident that I happen to flip to it one day while looking for something to watch.  After only a few minutes of watching how a father was concerned about his daughter dating a boy and how he handled it,  I was hooked. They may poke a little fun at one another, but they're not cruel or condescending.  Overall they actually seem pretty wise about life and know how to be good to each other.  The other real difference is they screw up once in awhile like most guys, and the results are often funny rather than hurting anyone.  Talk about a refreshing difference.

The ""Robertson Zone"" lifts viewer's spirits, with wholesome, eccentric-American fun. ""I'm a jack of all trades and a Renaissance Man - ain't nothin' I can't do,"" rightfully declares Uncle Si.

He dispenses valuable advice to his grandsons on finding the right woman, ""When you're talking 'bout bees, dogs, or women, pain can come up on you real fast."" That man has a voice made for listening to, he could say anything and make it compelling.

I was a little put back that the title calls it Season 2: Volume 1, but rest assured that this DVD contains all episodes from season 2.  I think A&E were trying to decide if they were going to call what they now call Season 3, since the seasons were very close together.  All in all, no problems, and the next DVD set to be released will be season 3, which recently concluded.",5,Great show,1369699200,"05 28, 2013",2013,454,"['love', 'show', 'am', 'glad', 'got', 'good', 'price', 'DVD', 'season', 'was', 'little', 'put', 'back', 'title', 'Season', '2', 'Volume', '1', 'rest', 'assured', 'DVD', 'episodes', 'season', '2', 'think', 'E', 'were', 'trying', 'decide', 'were', 'going', 'call', 'what', 'now', 'call', 'Season', '3', 'seasons', 'were', 'very', 'close', 'together', 'problems', 'next', 'DVD', 'set', 'be', 'released', 'will', 'be', 'season', '3', 'recently', 'concluded']",N/A

Why of why are there so many of these stupid shows about stupid white people acting like they are still in the 7th grade.  First off I am sick of seeing shows about stupid white people.  Don't we have enough of them.  I'm giving this show one star because it exists.  That someone published a show either about bad actresses acting like bad children or worse, Real people making Americans look stupid for a living.  If Aliens were shown this as a representation of humans they would think we were just a notch smarter than animals.  Maybe not ever that.  Nothing changes in any of the seasons.  They are all as predictable as seeing a rock squash a tomato.  It's boring and stupid and did I mention that this show makes Americans look stupid.  Yes I did.
