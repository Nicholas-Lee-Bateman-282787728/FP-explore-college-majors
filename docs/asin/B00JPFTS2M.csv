1696881,A28JK8TWOMD3TX,B00JPFTS2M,Cindy M,"[0, 0]","Ugh, I was surprised at just how bad this movie was, given the fact that Whoopi Goldberg (one of my favorites) played the lead character.  There are (barely) plausible moments in this over-dramatized, mostly implausible, overly-contentious dram-edy? (it never quite gets there), but they are too few and far between to do anything for the overall movie itself.  Worst of all, at the very end of the show, it goes suddenly saccharine as everyone sits in a circle in a far-fetched &#34;happy ending&#34;.  Save your money and watch an old gem like &#34;Kingdom Come&#34; again, because I think that's what they were trying to do with this one, and it missed the mark.",1,This One Is A Miss,1405728000,"07 19, 2014",2014,665,"['Ugh', 'was', 'surprised', 'just', 'how', 'bad', 'movie', 'was', 'given', 'fact', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'one', 'favorites', 'played', 'lead', 'character', 'are', 'barely', 'plausible', 'moments', 'over-dramatized', 'mostly', 'implausible', 'overly-contentious', 'dram-edy', 'never', 'quite', 'there', 'are', 'too', 'few', 'far', 'do', 'anything', 'overall', 'movie', 'Worst', 'very', 'end', 'show', 'suddenly', 'saccharine', 'everyone', 'circle', 'far-fetched', '34', 'happy', 'ending', '34', 'Save', 'money', 'watch', 'old', 'gem', '34', 'Kingdom', 'Come', '34', 'again', 'think', 'what', 'were', 'trying', 'do', 'one', 'missed', 'mark']",Day Late And A Dollar Short

Someone was evidently trying to set a record for the number of dysfunctional issues and problems shoved into a single script.  Every screaming match was met with ever diminishing returns and by the end of the movie, given how many screaming matches there were, the return was basically nonexistent.  Some of the arguing became comical, which I doubt was the effect the director was going for.  I have read some viewers praised the acting in this muckfest.  I hate to break it to you, but being asked to do little more than scream and act like a$%h*&%s is not that demanding.  And Whoopi Goldberg can do a better job of faking a death than that.  That was pitiful.",1,What a disaster,1404950400,"07 10, 2014",2014,718,"['One', 'worst', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'quite', 'while', 'Someone', 'was', 'evidently', 'trying', 'set', 'record', 'number', 'dysfunctional', 'issues', 'problems', 'shoved', 'single', 'script', 'screaming', 'match', 'was', 'met', 'ever', 'diminishing', 'returns', 'end', 'movie', 'given', 'how', 'many', 'screaming', 'matches', 'were', 'return', 'was', 'basically', 'nonexistent', 'arguing', 'became', 'comical', 'doubt', 'was', 'effect', 'director', 'was', 'going', 'have', 'read', 'viewers', 'praised', 'acting', 'muckfest', 'hate', 'break', 'being', 'asked', 'do', 'little', 'more', 'scream', 'act', '%', 'h*', '%', 's', 'not', 'demanding', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'can', 'do', 'better', 'job', 'faking', 'death', 'was', 'pitiful']",Day Late And A Dollar Short

After my sister told me it was going to air, I kept checking the tv listings to see if the date was showing on the menu yet. I couldn't wait to set my dvr.The Lifetime movie: A Day Late and a Dollar Short is based on the 2001 novel by Terry McMillan. I have read some of her work, but I didn't read this book. That did not stop me from wanting to watch the movie. The books I've read had humor so I expected to laugh as I watched this movie and I did laugh. I also had to shake my head at the choices some of the characters made. This movie certainly shows that nobody is perfect. It also shows how one person's imperfections can destroy another person's life. There was one part that made me angry and also made me want to cry. I usually can see that type of thing coming in a movie or book but I was so shocked.What Paris (Anika Noni Rose) and Shanice (Shanice Banton) were going through. What Viola (Whoopi Goldberg) had to put up with. All of the issues being dealt with. The dysfunction. The mistakes. The hard lessons. The ending. This was an emotional movie viewing experience.Great cast: Whoopi Goldberg, Ving Rhames, Anika Noni Rose, Mekhi Phifer, Kimberly Elise, Tichina Arnold and Lyriq Bent are all highly skilled actors. I wasn't familiar with the younger actors, but they did a good job. I'd like to see Shanice Banton more often.",5,An Emotional Movie Viewing Experience,1398038400,"04 21, 2014",2014,1378,"['watched', 'movie', 'Lifetime', 'sister', 'told', 'was', 'going', 'air', 'kept', 'checking', 'tv', 'listings', 'see', 'date', 'was', 'showing', 'menu', 'yet', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'set', 'dvr.The', 'Lifetime', 'movie', 'Day', 'Late', 'Dollar', 'Short', 'based', '2001', 'novel', 'Terry', 'McMillan', 'have', 'read', 'work', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'did', 'not', 'stop', 'wanting', 'watch', 'movie', 'books', ""'ve"", 'read', 'had', 'humor', 'so', 'expected', 'watched', 'movie', 'did', 'laugh', 'also', 'had', 'shake', 'head', 'choices', 'characters', 'made', 'movie', 'certainly', 'nobody', 'perfect', 'also', 'how', 'one', 'person', 'imperfections', 'can', 'destroy', 'person', 'life', 'was', 'one', 'part', 'made', 'angry', 'also', 'made', 'want', 'cry', 'usually', 'can', 'see', 'type', 'thing', 'coming', 'movie', 'book', 'was', 'so', 'shocked.What', 'Paris', 'Anika', 'Noni', 'Rose', 'Shanice', 'Shanice', 'Banton', 'were', 'going', 'What', 'Viola', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'had', 'put', 'up', 'issues', 'being', 'dealt', 'dysfunction', 'mistakes', 'hard', 'lessons', 'ending', 'was', 'emotional', 'movie', 'viewing', 'experience.Great', 'cast', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'Ving', 'Rhames', 'Anika', 'Noni', 'Rose', 'Mekhi', 'Phifer', 'Kimberly', 'Elise', 'Tichina', 'Arnold', 'Lyriq', 'Bent', 'are', 'highly', 'skilled', 'actors', 'was', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'younger', 'actors', 'did', 'good', 'job', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'Shanice', 'Banton', 'more', 'often']",Day Late And A Dollar Short

Her kids all hate each other, the husband has found a new woman and no one likes her anymore. After a health scare she is given news that changes her life. On the verge of death she decides it time to fix her family before it's too late. I will start with...yes this is a Lifetime movie, I am a guy, I actually did enjoy it. That said though it was a little too sappy for me. I think, like most movies lately, when another movie that is about the same thing comes out comparisons begin. This one is very much like August Osage County in plot and theme. While this movie was good and worth seeing August was so much better. Seeing that one first may have affected how I felt about this one but August had deeper relationships and just felt like a more complete movie. It may have been because it was a made-for-TV movie but this felt really thin compared to the other one. All that said though the movie is good and if you haven't seen August then you may like this more then I did. Overall, a good movie worth seeing but once again a movie suffers from being too identical to a recent movie. I give this a B-.",3,While this movie was good and worth seeing August Osage County was so much better.,1402531200,"06 12, 2014",2014,1248,"['34', 'whole', 'lot', 'mess', 'have', 'clean', 'up', 'go.', '34', 'Viola', 'Goldberg', 'matriarch', 'family', 'fallen', 'apart', 'kids', 'hate', 'other', 'husband', 'found', 'new', 'woman', 'one', 'anymore', 'health', 'scare', 'given', 'news', 'life', 'verge', 'death', 'time', 'fix', 'family', 'too', 'late', 'will', 'start', 'yes', 'Lifetime', 'movie', 'am', 'guy', 'actually', 'did', 'enjoy', 'said', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'sappy', 'think', 'most', 'movies', 'lately', 'when', 'movie', 'same', 'thing', 'out', 'comparisons', 'begin', 'one', 'very', 'much', 'August', 'Osage', 'County', 'plot', 'theme', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'worth', 'seeing', 'August', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'Seeing', 'one', 'first', 'may', 'have', 'affected', 'how', 'felt', 'one', 'August', 'had', 'deeper', 'relationships', 'just', 'felt', 'more', 'complete', 'movie', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'was', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'felt', 'really', 'thin', 'compared', 'other', 'one', 'said', 'movie', 'good', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'August', 'then', 'may', 'like', 'more', 'then', 'did', 'Overall', 'good', 'movie', 'seeing', 'once', 'again', 'movie', 'suffers', 'being', 'too', 'identical', 'recent', 'movie', 'give', 'B-']",Day Late And A Dollar Short
