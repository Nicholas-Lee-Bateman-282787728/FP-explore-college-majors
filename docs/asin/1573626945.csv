190694,A1PQLR0EN31PE8,1573626945,E. Smith,"[11, 12]","How do I describe this film?  Let's just say it's the end that makes this film (I believe direct to video) most interesting.  I have a theory about the life we lead and about each moment of that life.  What is real and what isn't?  How long a moment last? What may seem a second to the ordinary person, could be a whole lifetime to someone else.  Whether it's the first thought in your head or the last thought before you blink out of existence. With that said, you might think that this film explores that.  Perhaps, perhaps not.  It's what you think that happened. It's what you get out of this picture.  This is one of those films that warrants follow on discussions after you see it.  Especially for those who may go on to psychological, or better yet, philosophical endeavors.  Harvey Keitel plays a man who hasn't had such a pleasant life and he gets shot one day. During his recovery, he has a change of heart.  He meets Mira Sorvino.  Because he thinks he has met the perfect person things start to change for him and for her.  It's gets to be your basic love story.  Ah, but there is a twist (or is it really a twist).  That is all I am going to say about this film.  Rent it, catch it on cable and enjoy this well-made film.  It may be slow for some, but I think the pay off (in my opinion only) is worth it.",5,Highly Enjoyable,1067040000,"10 25, 2003",2003,1318,"['How', 'do', 'describe', 'film', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'end', 'film', 'believe', 'direct', 'video', 'most', 'interesting', 'have', 'theory', 'life', 'lead', 'moment', 'life', 'What', 'real', 'what', ""n't"", 'How', 'long', 'moment', 'last', 'What', 'may', 'seem', 'second', 'ordinary', 'person', 'could', 'be', 'whole', 'lifetime', 'someone', 'else', 'first', 'thought', 'head', 'last', 'thought', 'blink', 'existence', 'said', 'might', 'think', 'film', 'Perhaps', 'perhaps', 'not', 'what', 'think', 'happened', 'what', 'get', 'picture', 'one', 'films', 'warrants', 'follow', 'discussions', 'see', 'Especially', 'who', 'may', 'go', 'psychological', 'better', 'yet', 'philosophical', 'endeavors', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'man', 'who', ""n't"", 'had', 'such', 'pleasant', 'life', 'shot', 'one', 'day', 'recovery', 'change', 'heart', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', 'met', 'perfect', 'person', 'things', 'start', 'change', 'be', 'basic', 'love', 'story', 'Ah', 'twist', 'really', 'twist', 'am', 'going', 'say', 'film', 'Rent', 'catch', 'cable', 'enjoy', 'well-made', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'slow', 'think', 'pay', 'off', 'opinion', 'only', 'worth']",N/A
190695,A2NQUGGYM0DBM1,1573626945,L.A. Scene,"[4, 5]","Harvey Keitel is one of those actors who might not have a ten million dollar leading role, but he is an actor that has built up a large following.  One reason for Keitel's popularity is because he has often been stereotyped as a either a thug or gruff type of character - and has been able to pull off the role very well.  However Keitel has proven he is a very versatile actor and has proven this with a very nice portfolio of work over the past two decades.  Keitel proves his versatility in what was an unnoticed film in 1998 called ""Lulu on the Bridge"".  Despite some holes in the storyline, Keitel delivers a very solid performance and one that should keep his fans happy.  ""Lulu on the Bridge"" is a modern day romance story with a touch of fantasy added in.  While the movie itself will entertain you, I did feel that this movie could have even been better.In ""Lulu on the Bridge"", Keitel plays Isaac ""Izzy"" Maurer. Maurer is a jazz saxophonist in a little-known club band called Katmandu.  While not a criminal, we get a picture throughout the movie that Maurer has led anything but a saintly life.  While playing a performance at a New York City club, a madman sniper comes into the club and starts firing his gun.  In the chaos, Maurer is struck by sniper's bullet.  He suffers a major injury and loses a lung as a result of the shooting.  The loss of the lung ends the career that Maurer cherished - his musical career.  Maurer tries to adjust to life after music, but finds himself going the loner route.  In an effort to keep Maurer from being lonely, Maurer's ex-wife Hannah (played by Gina Gershon) and her boyfriend, filmmaker Phillip Kleinman (played by Mandy Pantakin) befriend him.  However, Izzy still seems destined for a lonely life.  That all changes when one night while walking home, he stumbles on the body of a murdered man named Stanley Mar.  On Mar, Maurer finds a napkin with a telephone number scribbled on it and a box containing a mysterious stone.  Maurer soon discovers the stone has magical properties.  When he dials the phone number on the napkin, this turns out to be the phone number of a much younger woman named Celia Burns (played by Mira Sorvino).  Celiat is a struggling actress who also moonlights as a waitress.  Maurer goes to Burns' apartment and has a rocky meeting with her.  Maurer then shows Celia the stone and its magical properties.  An ""aura"" of good seems to transform the two of them - and in particular Maurer.  This leads to an immediate ""connect"" between the two and they quickly become lovers.  Maurer becomes very happy in his relationship with Maurer and begins to see a side to himself he hadn't seen before.  However things change when an anthropologist named Dr. Van Horn (played Willem Dafoe) wants to get possession of the stone.  While Celia is out of town shooting a movie, Van Horn hunts down and captures Maurer.  While Van Horn wants to get possession of the stone, Maurer does everything to protect Celia who is in possession of the stone.There a lot of positives with this movie.  To start with, the performances by Keitel, Sorvino, and Dafoe are outstanding.  In particular, Keitel's performance is the one that stands out.  Keitel does a great job at showing his stereotypical gruff character when showing the ""old Izzy"".  However, we also see Keitel do a great job with his softer side.  I liked how Keitel showed the kinder and gentler Izzy - and he really showed a genuine love toward Celia as the movie went out.  There is one scene where Izzy has a ""relapse"" to his older side. This happens while Izzy is working as a busboy in the restaurant where Celia works in - it's classic Harvey Keitel.  Sorvino is radiant throughout the whole movie.  Cast as the villain, Dafoe does a great job.  The scenes in which Van Horn ""interrogates"" Maurer are terrific.  The part where Dafoe does his own rendition of ""Singing in the Rain"" is definitely a scene stealer.Overall, this was a very good romance story.  However, there are some things that could have been done better.  I thought the beginning of the movie needed to do a better job at establishing Maurer's ""bad side"".  We really don't pick up on this until we are into the meat of the storyline.  I did like the whole idea of the fantasy angle involving the magic stone.  However, the ""instantaneous love"" between Maurer and Celia almost happens too fast for my liking.  I really feel the movie could have benefited a lot more from showing how the romance grows and blossoms between Izzy and Maurer.  The other weak point is the character of Dr. Van Horn isn't developed very well either.  We don't get a lot of information on why Van Horn is obsessed  with getting the stone - and how he knows so much about Izzy Maurer.I also really liked the ending of this movie.  This is one of these films where it's going to be very difficult to pick things up in the middle of the story.  You need to watch this movie from start to finish.  I found the ending to have a great twist - and best of all was that it wasn't predictable.  While there were holes in the storyline, I'm still surprised that this movie didn't garner more attention - in particular for Sorvino and Keitel.  The Sorvino-Keitel chemistry was very evident in this movie.  I would love to see these two paired up in another movie someday. It is worth checking out Keitel's performance in this one - even though it isn't quite his stereoypical role.  As for the movie - in an era where Hollywood is flooded with remakes and un-original storylines, this is one original movie worth checking out.",3,Classic Harvey Keitel as well as a different side -

Keitel is splendid in his role, in this tale ofa musician who is a victim of a senseless shooting in a tavern,slipping into unconciousness, and then into a nightmare as his bloodpressure drops from the wound. The initial thoughts of the victim,is of fearing to lose his ability to capitalize on his fantasticmusical talents following the shooting incident, going to deeper,more moral aspects.For a tragedy, Sorvino is a not a bad choice, considering hernatural penchant for a sad, modest, shy, passive, at times childishintroverted image or  projected personality. Some may feel thisacting is an acquired taste, like watching paint dry.For DaFoe, a phenomenally talented actor, the script is the realtragedy, as he goes into a 7 minute churlish monolog, with Keitelobediently listening, and responding here and there, to the spiffylitany of spewed words, from this spiritual guide in the otherworld, deciding on the ultimate destiny for Keitel's soul that's inlimbo as he's driven to the hospital in an ambulance.The story's targeted audience are the urban dwellers of mega-cities,who can relate to the movie's setting, and modern conveniences (VCR,TV, hyper-populated streets, restaurants), as well as thespontaneous, shallow or rushed sexual rapports that tend to developbetween total strangers, under bizarre pretexts, in this case, a gemor rock that glows in the dark found on a murder victim in thestreet.Keitel's goal, is to adapt more to the fatuous drivel often seen onsitcoms, to take on that style a bit, vs his admitted hot tempered,undiplomatic, physical, tough guy confrontational approach thatsurfaces in situations of injustice, etc. Admittedly, he tellsDaFoe, he finds difficulty perceiving, sensing and enjoying all thesmall pleasures, artistic aspects, amusements that life has tooffer, limiting himself to work and sex, not being fully aware ofhis own feelings, as he says.There's some attempts at scatological humor, such as an airplanegag, or the opener, with "" I couldn't have arrived on stage anysooner, or my d*ck would be hanging out"".Incidentally, there's a portuguese fado number playing in thebackground at a cafe, probably by Mariza, with typical ""viola""guitar accompanying, that is a good choice, considering themelancholy that's typical of that music style.If depression is your gig, this is your DVD.",1,"If depression is your gig, this is your DVD",1182470400,"06 22, 2007",2007,2863,"['LULU', 'ON', 'THE', 'BRIDGE', '1998', 'movie', 'goal', 'was', 'beingdifferent', 'anything', 'else', 'been', 'made', 'story', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'people', 'business', 'who', 'have', 'seen', '1,000', 'worksover', 'lifetimes.The', 'music', 'most', 'often', 'played', 'lot', ""Bartok'sString"", 'Quartets', 'meaning', 'anyone', 'having', 'heard', 'canimagine', 'mood', 'work', 'anti-entertainment', 'bringingdepression', 'tragedy', 'audience.Harvey', 'Keitel', 'Willen', 'DaFoe', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', 'Gina', 'Gershon', 'are', 'thestars', 'work', 'Keitel', 'splendid', 'role', 'tale', 'ofa', 'musician', 'who', 'victim', 'senseless', 'shooting', 'tavern', 'slipping', 'unconciousness', 'then', 'nightmare', 'bloodpressure', 'wound', 'initial', 'thoughts', 'victim', 'fearing', 'lose', 'ability', 'capitalize', 'fantasticmusical', 'talents', 'following', 'shooting', 'incident', 'going', 'deeper', 'more', 'moral', 'aspects.For', 'tragedy', 'Sorvino', 'not', 'bad', 'choice', 'considering', 'hernatural', 'penchant', 'sad', 'modest', 'shy', 'passive', 'times', 'childishintroverted', 'image', 'projected', 'personality', 'may', 'feel', 'thisacting', 'acquired', 'taste', 'watching', 'paint', 'dry.For', 'DaFoe', 'phenomenally', 'talented', 'actor', 'script', 'realtragedy', '7', 'minute', 'churlish', 'monolog', 'Keitelobediently', 'listening', 'responding', 'here', 'there', 'spiffylitany', 'spewed', 'words', 'spiritual', 'guide', 'otherworld', 'deciding', 'ultimate', 'destiny', 'Keitel', 'soul', 'inlimbo', 'driven', 'hospital', 'ambulance.The', 'story', 'targeted', 'audience', 'are', 'urban', 'dwellers', 'mega-cities', 'who', 'can', 'relate', 'movie', 'setting', 'modern', 'conveniences', 'VCR', 'TV', 'hyper-populated', 'streets', 'restaurants', 'as', 'well', 'thespontaneous', 'shallow', 'rushed', 'sexual', 'rapports', 'tend', 'developbetween', 'total', 'strangers', 'bizarre', 'pretexts', 'case', 'gemor', 'rock', 'dark', 'found', 'murder', 'victim', 'thestreet.Keitel', 'goal', 'adapt', 'more', 'fatuous', 'drivel', 'often', 'seen', 'onsitcoms', 'take', 'style', 'bit', 'vs', 'admitted', 'hot', 'tempered', 'undiplomatic', 'physical', 'tough', 'guy', 'confrontational', 'approach', 'thatsurfaces', 'situations', 'injustice', 'etc', 'Admittedly', 'tellsDaFoe', 'difficulty', 'perceiving', 'sensing', 'enjoying', 'thesmall', 'pleasures', 'artistic', 'aspects', 'amusements', 'life', 'tooffer', 'limiting', 'work', 'sex', 'not', 'being', 'fully', 'aware', 'own', 'feelings', 'attempts', 'scatological', 'humor', 'such', 'airplanegag', 'opener', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'arrived', 'stage', 'anysooner', 'd*ck', 'would', 'be', 'hanging', 'out', '.Incidentally', 'portuguese', 'fado', 'number', 'playing', 'thebackground', 'cafe', 'probably', 'Mariza', 'typical', 'viola', 'guitar', 'accompanying', 'good', 'choice', 'considering', 'themelancholy', 'typical', 'music', 'style.If', 'depression', 'gig', 'DVD']",N/A

Though the actors struggled valiantly to make it all come together, the dialogue was often pedantic and unbelievable.The scenes themselves were often implausible, and not for the metaphysical reasons the director may suspect.  No, the slice of life bits made it difficult for me to suspend my disbelief.

I don't know of any girls that age who would ask to be tucked in, especially around company.I think the problem with this movie is that it tries too hard to be deep; it tries too hard to demonstrate the innocence of real life.
