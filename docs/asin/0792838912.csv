It was the scene where John blindfolds and seduces Elizabeth with an ice cube. I was so aroused on by that scene I decided I would find out somemore about the movie. Some described it as a beautiful blue movie. While other described it as sadistic and degrading to women. I decided I would check it out for myself. So I did, and after I watched it I found I had similar feelings that I had after watching Secratary. I longed so badly be in a relationship like the one in the movie. I was sooo turned on by many of the scenes in the movie, esspecially the scene where John and Elizabeth are making passionate love in the ally in the rain. I found myself quite aroused by the idea of being the submissive one, and not knowing what was going to happen next.

141570,A1P27BGF8NAI29,0792838912,Alice in Wonderland,"[5, 5]","This is the story of Elizabeth McGraw, a successful but lonely art gallery assistant, who meets a darkly mysterious man who seems to be ready to unlock her inner wildness. Together they set out on a 9 & 1/2 week affair in which they push every boundary, and leave no experience untried. However, McGraw comes to realize that there is something missing, something beyond the physical.This is a great movie. Kim Basinger brings a depth of personality to the role of Elizabeth McGraw, making me think that this is actually her finest performance. Mickey Rourke does a great job as well, giving John Grey that great combination of passion and distance. The story is compelling and absolutely fascinating as you watch the couple's relationship spring up and then unravel. Also, the soundtrack is great, a really inspired selection of tunes.True, it is not a romance movie in the normal sense. But it is a true and powerful look at a sort of sexual relationship - erotica colliding with real world people.Great movie - powerful movie!

141573,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0792838912,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","I remember the first time I saw `9  Weeks'.  I was like fourteen and I was watching it for one very obvious reason.  It didn't really do much for me.  It reminded me of `Basic Instinct' in a way, a film I also so at a tender teen age for the very same reason.  It was just lukewarm for me and at the time (and even today) didn't really introduce me to anything I was overly excited to see.  I was letdown, in that department.  Watching `9  Weeks' in my later years and obviously watching it for different reasons, one is able to differentiate between those teen observations and one of a more mature moviegoer.  That isn't to say that `9  Weeks' is a very good movie or that it actually says a lot of what it attempts to say about relationships and the dangers therein, but I do gather more from this than that awkward moment where food became perverted and I became disinterested.  Other films that have been likened to `9  Weeks' like `Secretary' or `Last Tango in Paris' are far more observant of their themes and develop them in a more substantial way, but credit should be given to Adrian Lyne for trying to add some depth to her spice.

141578,A1PASRZ81DY9C,0792838912,Austin Somlo,"[3, 4]","Viewed: 5/06, 6/07, 2/09Rate: 105/06: When I read the reviews after finishing 9  Weeks in a stunning amazement, I was quite dismayed by the low opinions of this vastly underrated motion picture. It goes without saying that 9  Weeks is a very largely misunderstood film, and while I haven't really grasped why 9  Weeks doesn't receive the appropriate acclaim as it deserves, I now don't care what the others think. The film is an absolute classic and the most sexual film I've ever seen. Starting with Kim Basinger, she has never acted this well in her entire career. Her characterization of the confused Elizabeth is dead-on perfect because she plays the innocent, curious seeker who didn't see how psychologically damaging the aftermath would be.  Mickey Rourke...what can I say? He practically steals the film in every scene. John's mysteriousness makes himself a compelling character, forcing the relationship between the two to suffer from his dangerous game of feelings. In a result, the build-up of tension through mind games bring much of strain to his lover, leading to the tragic and unforgettable chilling ending. The casting of the two leads is one of the best on-screen duos. Granted, the passion and chemistry between Mickey Rourke and Kim Basinger melt a bowl of ice cream within seconds. What makes 9  Weeks so great is how much more meaningful and powerful the film is than Last Tango in Paris. Marlon Brando had neither an idea what his film was all about nor had any clue what he was doing in the movie. But 9  Weeks, everybody feels a purpose and becomes prepared for the psychological sexual journey of feelings. As sexually wild and exhilarating as 9  Weeks is, the greatest assets of the film are: the notion of ""less is more,"" the control of subtlety, the vivid cinematography, the strict openness and closeness, and the depth of mysterious aspects. Making Mickey Rourke's character to be a paradoxically dashing figure is easily the most singular importance of 9  Weeks and is the chief reason why it remains a compelling film to watch. All in all, 9  Weeks is the most erotic picture made, period.6/07: 9  Weeks features two outstanding performances from Mickey Rourke and Kim Basinger. The sexual masterpiece, from a psychological stand-point, comes with a profound misunderstanding. The reason for this is most people never experienced this kind of escapade. The movie depicts neither mind nor body control but rather studies how one person goes far enough to the point that confusion of feelings sets in. 9  Weeks' director Adrian Lynne does an admirable job of it. When I see Mickey Rourke as John, I see the charm along with the aura of mysteriousness. There is a Brando quality about him. Mickey Rourke attains this until, at the end, he suddenly becomes a real person, exposing a vulnerability within in. Of course, Elizabeth's vulnerability is also exposed much earlier and makes her a real person in the process. Interestingly, the sex scenes are not what are important in a relationship. Hence, the ending says it all for me about 9  Weeks.2/09: John...is there a more puzzling, mysterious character? When I think of that desperate attempt to win back Elizabeth's feelings in the final few minutes, his vulnerability is exposed. That really demonstrates the brilliance of 9  Weeks. The psychological games, the exhilarating sense of danger, the cascade of tests, the manipulation, the subtle shaping of obedience, the sex without love, and the confusion of feelings all spell doom between John and Elizabeth. Mickey Rourke does something so remarkable by pushing Kim Basinger to the limits, and she goes further in her character like she has never in her career. The result is that she gives a performance of her career. All in all, 9  Weeks is a cinematic masterpiece of unbridled romance, sex, and feelings only to be undone by a complicated series of basic human needs.",5,Masterpiece.

141597,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,0792838912,Dennis Littrell,"[6, 9]","What one realizes while watching this is how limited and ultimately unsatisfactory is a relationship based purely on sex.I imagine that the familiar dominance/submissive psychology at the heart of this visually stunning movie--and it really is beautifully shot--comes from the novel by Elizabeth MacNeil.  I say that, not having read the novel, because the seduction of Manhattan art dealer Elizabeth (Kim Basinger) by the smooth and supremely confident financier John (Mickey Rourke) is so very well done with the expensive presents, the well-timed flower deliveries, little endearments, etc., that it amounts to a woman's fantasy.  The partial debasement of Elizabeth and her eventual triumph over her darker instincts and her realization that there is a difference between love and submission is also something that one might expect to find in a woman's point-of-view novel.However when we get to the actual sexuality and how it is acted out, it is unclear who dreamed up the scenes, MacNeil or director Adrian Lyne or the scriptwriters.  I say this because the scenes were so predictable and so ordinary, and when not ordinary and predictable, were bordering on the just plain dumb.  Making love in the rain, at the top of a tall building (inside the clock tower), blindfolding the woman, making her crawl, feeding her strawberries, etc., bring nothing new to eroticism.  And the scene requiring some imagination--[...]--was not realistically done.  Why directors insist on allowing a man holding onto the hand of woman to outrun the men chasing them never ceases to amaze me.  And then to have Elizabeth and John stop in the middle of the street to allow the bashers they have outrun to catch up was just plain stupid, not to mention the phony fight that followed.Not only were the sexual scenes predictable but clearly Lyne was in harness (and I am glad of that) since he stops well short of what might happen if this sort of theme were fully played out.Putting all that aside what makes this movie worth seeing is Kim Basinger.  She is absolutely stunning, and it is clear that Lyne and his camera adored her.  More than that Basinger does a fine job of acting in a demanding role.  I was impressed.  Before seeing this film I thought she was a rather ordinary actress, but her ability to combine grown-up New York chic with little-girl vulnerability and to make absolutely clear the psychological dilemma her character's heart faced really held the movie together.Lyne's insistence on whispered dialogue difficult to hear was consistent with the theme of the movie but not kind to these ears.  But that was okay because much of the dialogue was secondary to the visual exploration of the woman's sexuality.  The peek-a-boo and off center and shadowed shots of Basinger's face and her silhouette, and the studied smile from Rourke combined with the stark black and whites of their clothes and the furnishings served to highlight and emphasis the flesh tones of Basinger's skin while lending an appropriate artistic and fashionable atmosphere to the movie, which after all has an art dealer at its center.  The many scenes that were began and suggested, and then cut away from, allowed a richer texture of experience for the viewer than would have been possible had the scenes been played out.  And that was doubly good because again it is the visuals that make this movie worth seeing, not the originality of the story and its development.To those viewers who thought that this was some sort of high class pornography, I can only say you missed the point entirely, and indeed, you may be projecting your own sorry mentality.See this for Kim Basinger whose sensitive and robust beauty dominated the screen.",3,Kim Basinger makes this worth seeing,1080086400,"03 24, 2004",2004,3712,"['What', 'one', 'realizes', 'watching', 'how', 'limited', 'ultimately', 'unsatisfactory', 'relationship', 'based', 'purely', 'sex.I', 'imagine', 'familiar', 'dominance/submissive', 'psychology', 'heart', 'visually', 'stunning', 'movie', 'really', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'novel', 'Elizabeth', 'MacNeil', 'say', 'not', 'having', 'read', 'novel', 'seduction', 'Manhattan', 'art', 'dealer', 'Elizabeth', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'smooth', 'supremely', 'confident', 'financier', 'John', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'so', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'expensive', 'presents', 'well-timed', 'flower', 'deliveries', 'little', 'endearments', 'etc.', 'woman', 'fantasy', 'partial', 'debasement', 'Elizabeth', 'eventual', 'triumph', 'darker', 'instincts', 'realization', 'difference', 'love', 'submission', 'also', 'something', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'find', 'woman', 'point-of-view', 'novel.However', 'when', 'get', 'actual', 'sexuality', 'how', 'acted', 'out', 'unclear', 'who', 'dreamed', 'up', 'scenes', 'MacNeil', 'director', 'Adrian', 'Lyne', 'scriptwriters', 'say', 'scenes', 'were', 'so', 'predictable', 'so', 'ordinary', 'when', 'not', 'ordinary', 'predictable', 'were', 'bordering', 'just', 'plain', 'dumb', 'Making', 'love', 'rain', 'top', 'tall', 'building', 'clock', 'tower', 'blindfolding', 'woman', 'making', 'crawl', 'feeding', 'strawberries', 'etc.', 'bring', 'nothing', 'new', 'eroticism', 'scene', 'requiring', 'imagination', '[', ']', 'was', 'not', 'realistically', 'done', 'Why', 'directors', 'insist', 'allowing', 'man', 'holding', 'hand', 'woman', 'outrun', 'men', 'chasing', 'never', 'amaze', 'then', 'have', 'Elizabeth', 'John', 'stop', 'middle', 'street', 'allow', 'bashers', 'have', 'outrun', 'catch', 'up', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'stupid', 'not', 'mention', 'phony', 'fight', 'only', 'were', 'sexual', 'scenes', 'predictable', 'clearly', 'Lyne', 'was', 'harness', 'am', 'glad', 'well', 'short', 'what', 'might', 'happen', 'sort', 'theme', 'were', 'fully', 'played', 'out.Putting', 'aside', 'what', 'movie', 'seeing', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'clear', 'Lyne', 'camera', 'adored', 'More', 'Basinger', 'fine', 'job', 'acting', 'demanding', 'role', 'was', 'impressed', 'seeing', 'film', 'thought', 'was', 'rather', 'ordinary', 'actress', 'ability', 'combine', 'grown-up', 'New', 'York', 'chic', 'little-girl', 'vulnerability', 'make', 'absolutely', 'clear', 'psychological', 'dilemma', 'character', 'heart', 'faced', 'really', 'held', 'movie', 'together.Lyne', 'insistence', 'whispered', 'dialogue', 'difficult', 'hear', 'was', 'consistent', 'theme', 'movie', 'not', 'kind', 'ears', 'was', 'okay', 'much', 'dialogue', 'was', 'secondary', 'visual', 'exploration', 'woman', 'sexuality', 'peek-a-boo', 'center', 'shadowed', 'shots', 'Basinger', 'face', 'silhouette', 'studied', 'smile', 'Rourke', 'combined', 'stark', 'black', 'whites', 'clothes', 'furnishings', 'served', 'highlight', 'emphasis', 'flesh', 'tones', 'Basinger', 'skin', 'lending', 'appropriate', 'artistic', 'fashionable', 'atmosphere', 'movie', 'art', 'dealer', 'center', 'many', 'scenes', 'were', 'began', 'suggested', 'then', 'cut', 'away', 'allowed', 'richer', 'texture', 'experience', 'viewer', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'possible', 'had', 'scenes', 'been', 'played', 'out', 'was', 'doubly', 'good', 'because', 'again', 'visuals', 'make', 'movie', 'seeing', 'not', 'originality', 'story', 'development.To', 'viewers', 'who', 'thought', 'was', 'sort', 'high', 'class', 'pornography', 'can', 'only', 'say', 'missed', 'point', 'entirely', 'indeed', 'may', 'be', 'projecting', 'own', 'sorry', 'mentality.See', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'sensitive', 'robust', 'beauty', 'dominated', 'screen']",N/A

Just to be clear, ny beef is mainly with the this edition, not with the movie itself.This 2009 release is the same one that was released in 2002. It doesn't add absolutely anything. No extras except for the trailer. The DVD is one of those Double Sided DVD's (single layer) that has a Full-Screen and a Widescreen side (this really sucks as double sided disks are very inconvenient because you have to be extra careful not to scratch the surfaces). Also the transfer is terrible. The image is grainy and dirty.

Thankfully all of these issues have been delt with on this new release.  I have just finished watching the blu-ray disc and can happily report that this is an absolutely gorgeous transfer.  Blacks are coal deep and  colors are vibrant overall, allowing for Lyne's tendency for push processing and the resulting purposefully grainy texture which is noticeable in the transfer.

When the relationship does end, you wish it could have continued.  It gets that kind of grip on you even though it becomes very offensive to the young woman involved.

I found this to be a thoroughly entertaining film, with fascinating performances and all the 80's accoutrement's - music, fashion, set decoration, etc. I find it interesting that people can get so many different feelings and experiences from one movie. I don't know how anyone could call it boring, but we all see different things when we watch a movie.There are wondrous scenes of erotic intimacy here (unfortunately not as fully developed as they could be) - and glimpses into just what two people ""in lust"" will allow themselves to be led into... The sensuousness of the relationship is the key - not the believability of the surroundings or the rest of the 'plot'. Is it believable? It certainly is conceivable... Liz (Kim Basinger) studying slides at work, so distracted by her thoughts of intimacy with a man she hardly knows that she can't keep her hands off herself... John so taken with her that he will spend exorbitantly for a gift - to give a woman he doesn't know - but feels that he must meet. The passion and need for these two lonely people that lets them open doors to their inner selves and allow another in BEFORE thinking of the consequences (there are ALWAYS consequences, in film and life; for opening ""those"" doors). Is it believable that they would win the fight with the street thugs? No. Is it believable that the adrenaline rush, the release of the flight impulse and fear, the closeness found in 'defeating a common enemy'; could possibly lead to the intensity of sexual closeness and climax in a semi-secluded spot (under falling water at that)? Yes. It's entertainment, not a psychology class.This movie, dated as it is, is still fresh because it is enough like life to be real. Anyone who can remember working in an office in the 80s will relate to the telex machines, phones with bell-rings, and no desktop computer for the manger, and no mobile phones. The 80s apartment decor and fashions will also jog memories.  A number of us may not be that rich or that attractive or that selfish or that spoiled.

I only comment on DVD picture & sound quality and leave the drama reviews to others.I am well aware of the artistic significance of this 1986 film, yet I cannot believe that director Adrian Lyne and Warner Brothers could be proud of, or even allow to be sold, a disc of garbage that this is.  It proves they are just out to make a buck and have no pride.I'm not too familiar with all the production details of the film and at this point I do not care.  I know it took a big loss when it was released theatrically; I also recall that I rented it on VHS tape in the late 80's and as I remember it looked a LOT better than this DVD.  Warner Bros. made no attempt to clean it up at all.  I would not be surprised to learn that the source material was a beat-up VHS tape to produce this DVD.If you really are considering this DVD, let me tell you that the ""widescreen"" version is a mini-picture, so you are probably better off watching the full-screen flipside version since it is actually larger.  I can only assume this was Lyne's college student film or maybe his high school project as it looks like it was shot on Super 8.$17-million budget... hmmm... where was the money spent?  Someone please tell me.  The filmmakers certainly did not hire a script supervisor as there are continuity errors galore.  The sound would be appropriate for an 80's film with no attempt at restoration or enhancement.The longest I can watch of this DVD at one time is about 30 minutes before I get bored... there is just not enough production quality to tolerate it as a motion picture.  Again, I can't believe that Warner Bros. and Lyne would put this crap out but they did.  Evidently they view the film as a ""loser"", and it is.Oh, if all this were not enough, you may have difficulty getting the ""widescreen"" version side to even function in your DVD player.  I have to eject and re-insert it several times.  Junk.Seeing Kim Basinger is great, but there are many other films to see her in than in this dump of a DVD.

141635,A2FBS0A33MWO9I,0792838912,Jolar70,"[4, 6]","The most shocking thing about ""9 1/2 Weeks"" is that it was actually made by adults! When this came out in '86, I was 18 and I LOVED it, but NOT for the reasons you might think. I was a sucker for visual style at the time, even over content (Miami Vice, etc.), and I saw it many times in the theater. Having not seen it for about ten years I thought it would be fun to re-visit. What I found was a deeply dated film on the verge of self-parody. Certain episodes in their ""obsessive"" courtship are sitcom-ready but it's the characters themselves that just don't ring true. Kim Basinger, as Elizabeth is just kind of thick-headed. She's best in the final scenes but, prior to that, she's frustratingly naive and I don't buy her as an art dealer for a second! Mickey Rourke is equally annoying; answering most lines with his trademark smirk. Who would really put up with that?! What's interesting is how great he is when he's given a moment to improvise (as with the kids on the boardwalk) but then he's out of character. I like Mickey Rourke, and before Michael Madsen made a career out of stealing his whole shtick (right down to the mannerisms and delivery) he was truly unique (his cameo in ""The Pledge"" with Jack Nicholson is heart-breaking!), but he's not given enough room here.Another problem is the music. This movie would be 50% better without ANY music, not just the pop songs but the whole sappy score as well. There's a nice Al Green intro at the beginning of the titles and Stewart Copeland, of The Police, wrote a cool instrumental for some Wall Street exteriors, but everything else should go! Of course, coming off of ""Flash Dance"", (the movie pretty much responsible for pop song soundtracks), I guess it's not a surprise, but the top 40 pop hurts this supposedly edgy, adult drama.What does work is the brilliant casting of every other character in the film. From the sales woman in the department store (an AMAZING performance!) to all of Elizabeth's art world friends. Visually the film holds up alright but not as flawlessly as other, more imaginitive, visual films of it's day like ""Blade Runner"". It's a nice picture-portrait of New York at the time, though.The truth is that the mid-80's were full of fluffy dramas and this one had the promise of going beyond that but, in the end, the director, or the movie company, totally betrayed its potential which is really too bad.

Elizabeth (Basinger) is dumb in some parts, she lets John (Rourke) have total, well almost, total control of her life and how she does thinks and dresses. In one scene, when he is feeding her she looks like someone that should be in a hospital. She looked sick. Because it is from the '80s the hair and clothes are a bit too much, but hey that is what was in at the time the movie was made. I enjoyed the sex scenes.

One day while in a store with her friend she runs into John(Mickey Rourke).  There connection is instant, although neither of them acts on the initial impulse.  Later in a open market John sees Elizabeth and proceeds to sweep her off her feet.  There relationship gains momentum quickly.  John takes control of Elizabeth, particularly, in the physical part of the affair.  He makes her do things she has never done before, and despite being timid at times, she seems powerless to his demands.  As John and Elizabeth get more involved they eventually fall in love.The film ends rather unexpectedly.  Despite some weak subplots this remains a strong film.  What makes it so strong is the electric chemistry between Rourke and Basinger.  They make the film quite watchable.  The direction by Adrian Lyne is exactly what it should be.

141665,A24AY6NOKLJNWC,0792838912,OneTaste,"[3, 4]","It was hard for me to believe that I completely missed this 80s film! I thought that I had seen all of the greats of that era! I read some of the reviews and learned that many women secretly attested to loving this movie, but were not comfortable openly admitting it, for fear of being perceived as bad girls.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie because it contained many of the key ingredients that make for a successful and powerful seduction. John (Mickey Rourke) demonstrated the masculine attributes that inspire a powerful attraction in the opposite sex. Confidence, a guy who knows what he wants and is not afraid to go after it, a guy who doesn't really care what others out there might think, a guy who lives life as if it is his bedroom, but the most powerful of all the seduction chess pieces that he plays, is that of ""mystery."" He hardly ever answers any of Basinger's direct questions. He simply smiles instead and draws her in with curiosity. Just like a putty cat that you lightly push away, Basinger kept coming right back, over and over again.One reviewer on here felt that John did not portray the role of a ""nice guy"" in this film. Yet, I felt that such assessment is definitely open to interpretation. ""My"" interpretation is that he ""did"" (initially, at least) play the role of a ""nice"" guy because he invested so much time and energy in creating for Basinger, a pallet of potent emotional experiences. He wanted to take complete care of her, but did so in a way that kept her guessing, kept her wondering, he never revealed what was under the mystery dance. He was always ""spontaneous,"" she never knew exactly what he was going to come up with next. I think people often confuse ""nice guys"" with ""dorks"" who will overide their own personality, their own creativity, what makes them unique, to give way to a woman who they feel attracted to. Yet, do women really find such a guy attractive?  Tons of research says ""NO."" I am also convinced that there is a strategic and creative balancing act required, and at the beginning, Rourke played it very well. His character portrays the nice guy, in the ""non-distorted"" way, until he flips the scales that is, crosses the line, and no longer recognizes that the painting of emotional experience that the brush of his actions were creating in Basinger, were no longer on the ""positive,"" enjoyable, blissful--side of the emotional spectrum.I loved this scene where John takes Basinger shopping and he has her try on some outfits. He sits back admiring her beauty and decides on one outfit that to ""him,"" looks the best on her. When they go up to the register, Basinger asks him: ""John, aren't you going to ask me how 'I' like this?""  John smiles at her and says; ""no,"" as he places one after another $100 bill on the counter. I think that ""unconsciously,"" women find men who take charge like this, who know what they want, who are firm and secure, to be quite attractive.Another reviewer on here stated that we should watch the movie, ""not for the sex but for the magic,"" and I totally agree! I loved how the movie smoothly progressed into more intense plots that seemed to threaten the boundary between sanity and insanity, what is acceptable and that which is totally unaccetable (or abnormal). I don't want to ruin the movie for anyone, but there are many scenes, and one in particular, where you are forced to wonder what you would do, how you would react in such a circumstance. Eventually, it was this scene which took place in a hotel room that seemed to end up being the straw that broke the proverbial camel's back. You have to see the movie to know what happened. After that, Basinger seemed to realize what she was dealing with. It was as if the ""context"" of John's new game and the nature of the emotions that it provoked, caused Basinger to abruptly snap out of the seduction trance. The spell had lost its power.I didn't give the movie a ""perfect"" rating because I feel that the ending left too many loose ends untied. I felt that it was too abrupt, left too much up in the air. Its as if it left you wanting an explanation from Basinger. She was having such a blast, excitedly clasping the handrails of an emotional roller coaster, then hands way up in the air, reaching for the sky, happily yelling at the top of her lungs. You see the ""sparks"" that many reviewers here describe, turn into all out ""thunder bolts,"" and then, suddenly, all you see are rain showers cascading from Basinger's beautiful eyes. Even though you might, indeed sense what it was that flips the switch, there is no concrete footing given, nothing to give you absolute closure. I even got this sense that the creators had gone beyond their alloted time limits and were forced to edit the movie down in a way that left something important out of the ending. But, I am open to the alternative. Perhaps I am totally off and it was ""exactly"" how the writer intended to end this great cinematographic story. Leaving us wondering, as John had left this blonde beauty wondering so many times, ""what's next, what's next, what's next?"" The patterns that seduced Basinger, end up being the same cards that the writer plays to seduce us....Enjoy!",3,"Great Demonstration of ""The Art of Seduction!""",1357948800,"01 12,

The movie is a lot more than that. It shows Mickey Rourke as ""John"" in the only way available to him to feel and express love and desire. His lack of the full emotional range results in his needing highly controlled situations to get excited. He loves Elizabeth's beauty, but can't see-can't love HER, even though she is very lovable. He treats her like a pretty object.  He's so disconnected from his own feelings, he talks very little, always in a controlled way. He has no interest in what Elizabeth feels-only in how she reacts to the situations he sets up.He observes her reactions closely with pleasure and amusement, like studying an insect under a microscope; he is a spectator rather than a participant. He cannot feel, and makes her feel instead, to see what it's like (""I saw myself in you"" and ""What does it feel like to be out of control!"", he told her).Elizabeth liked him  very much from the first moment she saw him. She thought this was a relationship like most others so she invites him to meet her friends. When he refuses, she submits-she likes him so much that she starts going along with HIS shaping of their relationship.The little ""normal"" voice inside her speaks again, when she asks, ""Aren't you interested whether I like the dress?"", after he buys her clothes of his own choice. His answer is telling: ""No, I'm not"", spoken with a tender, beguiling, confusing smile, and soft, caressing voice, which-to her- belie the truth of his words. She just can't put together in her mind his tenderness, soft voice, polite manners, good looks, expensive gifts, breakfast in bed, ""I want to take care of you"", ""I love you Elizabeth"" with his actual indifference to her feelings,and his progressively humiliating and hurtful demands.He even whispered ""I love you"" in her ear the moment before he went to open the door to the prostitute he had arranged to visit them-you'll hear it if the volume is up.She continues going along with his demands, trying to please him, until the moment comes when she realizes he will not give her any of the loving interest that his tender smile and soft voice promised  her at the beginning. She obviously has fallen in love with him, and as she walks away for the last time from his place, she turns her head back hopefully, crying, in case he has ran after her-still hoping for a real sign of love from him, in spite of her best sense that this guy is incapable of love as we know it. Just like most women would. Meanwhile, he stands frozen, close to tears, willing her to come back ""...until I count to 50..."", but unable to just open that door and catch her.There were two things that the director used to tell us clearly that John was a control freak; shots of his closet with the evenly spaced hangers as if with a ruler and lots of identical shirts, pants, and coats and nothing else, and his desk drawer, with everything in its place, and a place for everything, chillingly neat. He was a man with a total need to control his environment (usually resulting from high anxiety).Also, how he avoided personal involvement is shown in their first conversation at the Italian restaurant: Here he was sitting with a lovely, sexy woman who obviously likes him, and his conversation was not flirtacious, not about him, not about her, but the history of murders in the restaurant. Maybe only someone who has met a man with these outward signs and symptoms  can connect them to the huge emotional lack of his feelings.And the much talked-about sexual scenes are vital to the story because that was ALL their interaction, there was no usual closeness and talks about each other's life, family, etc.The director makes that clear, showing us Elizabeth's attempt at sharing a funny tidbit about her dead uncle: John ends that attempt with his comment about his own Stock Exchange screens.A very accurate psychological portrait of a highly attractive man unable to love, with a twisted attitude towards relationships, and a woman who is soft and hopeful for 9 1/2 weeks, before she leaves him when the pain  becomes too much.It is so interesting to see that at no time does he question his behavior towards her-at no time does he apologize. He behaves as if it is the most natural thing to ask of her what he asks.Only those who have known people like that will realize how correct the portrayal in the movie is-and I have.Mickey Rourke and Kim Basinger were superb in these highly nuanced roles, with award-meriting performances. ""9 1/2 weeks"" is a psychological drama of great depth and accuracy, told beautifuly on the screen.02/05/06:I read the book by Elizatheth McNeill,ISBN: 0060746394. I tried to find info. about her on the web, publishing house, etc. Nothing. There is another Elizabeth McNeill at Severn House Publishers, author of :  The Lady Of Cawnpore. Press Relations. Hot News. Unforgettable. The Last Cocktail Party. A Bombay Affair. The Golden Days.So it is not the same Elizabeth McNeill who wrote ""9 1/2 Weeks, the memoir of a love affair"". That McNeill has vanished.All I can say is that they should have made two movies: the one they made, and another one, with the same actors, true to the book, to be released later. The book is short, written in an amazingly personal, simple,raw way, which-having seen the film-brought it to life. It does not have one extraneous word in it. I can understand why they could not make the movie as the book  really was. The book was truly sadistic-she was tied to the leg of the table for example. The film, even though much milder than the book, succeeded very well in portraying John as the author lived him. The book does round out the experience, and the ending is very different than the film's. The book really cemented my opinion that this story did happen.",5,"A most true, and most misunderstood masterpiece",1129248000,"10 14, 2005",2005,5894,"['SPOILERS', 'are', 'many', 'ways', 'see', '9',

141673,A2ULQOGN59LDNK,0792838912,Richard J. Brzostek,"[15, 16]","""9 1/2 Weeks"" is an erotic thriller about the romance between Elizabeth (Kim Basinger) and John (Mickey Rourke).  As the name implies, their time together is not long, but without a doubt steamy and memorable.  John had his eye on Elizabeth from the beginning and swooped down like a hawk, while she could not resist his advances.Elizabeth falls in love with him very fast, and even as John becomes increasingly controlling and dominating, she still cannot break free from his charms.  He showers her with gifts almost continuously, but I hardly think they had much affect on her, since it was him and his excitement she seemed to like most.  The interactions and intimacy between two people are taken to a high level as she is blindfolded and he touches her body with ice cubes, as he feeds her with her eyes closed, and has sexual encounters with her in places such as a back alley and a clock tower.  The film does have more than a few erotic/sexual scenes, but not as vulgar as it could be, leaving some things to the imagination.Because I really did not know what to expect with John and if and when he would snap from being calm to angry, I was on edge for most of the movie.  Actually, he retained his exterior calmness even when he was dominating her, giving him a true covertly hostile personality.  On the other hand, Elizabeth was often timid and just wanted to be loved.  Moreover, although she may not have enjoyed all the games he wanted to play, it did look like she enjoyed much of them.

141674,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,0792838912,Robert J. Crawford,"[7, 7]","This is quite a quirky film.  On the one hand, there is a passionate sexual relationship that seeks to ever increase excitment, etc. through ever more bizarre games.  In this, it is an affair that is unusual, but not unhealthy in my view as many state here.  On the other hand, there is a serious examination of the two people involved, both of whom are not very good at relationships.  All the reasons for their failures - and the bad mix that they become - is portrayed clearly, and while it isn't appallingly deep, it is a solid novelistic treatment.  So the content is quite good, a slice of life in passionate experimentation that eventually transgresses too many bounds.  I believe it is somewhat of a classic of the genre of deep porn.  Now that I am a middle-aged man and not their age, I still thought it was very good.There is also an artistic backdrop, which appeared a bit stilted to me after 20 years.  The music cut-ins felt a bit contrived, the New York art world - and I was living there at the time and into that world - doesn't appear at all relevant anymore.  I was surprized I felt this way.Interestingly, the film diverges from the book.  Without giving anything away - and this did not happen in the film - at the end the guy just leaves when the woman has a nervous breakdown, their encounters having become the focus of her existence.  He remains distant and never reflects on who he is, what he is doing, or what the woman means to him.Recommended.

Elizabeth does not understand this and has trouble with this magical mystery tour since she has never met a wealthy, gentle, caring man who is a master of all flavours of erotic delights, and, he has the patience to court, woo and gently seduce our heroine ....

LOL ) ......The erotic seductions scenes are skillfully done, and, the scene on the kitchen floor where Rourke feeds Bassinger a luscious assortment of foods is probably the best food erotic scene ever filmed. Trust me, there aren't many of todays actress stars that would allow the camera to get in that close to their faces as Bassinger did while literally gobbling up those dleights that she should get an academy award for that performance ....Finally, I would venture to guess that most men would not enjoy this movie, (they wouldn't have the patience and besides that's why they invented porn)  but, I can assure you, that if you are a woman and reads romance novels you'll, love it, and, here's the best part, if you are a woman that enjoys erotic literature, well then RUN and I mean RUN and buy this DVD cause like I said, hands down, (or whatever) it's fabulous and you won't love this DVD you'll gobble it all up ......",5,Hands down( sorry for pun) best erotic DVD video ever....,1011052800,"01 15, 2002",2002,2406,"['avid', 'reader', 'erotic', 'literature', 'certainly', 'understandable', 'most', 'erotic', 'books', 'could', 'hardly', 'be', 'put', 'film', 'cast', 'producers', 'being', 'immediately', 'summarily', 'jailed', 'powers', 'be.However', 'DVD', 'top', 'notch', 'entertainers', 'front', 'cameras', 'have', 'managed', 'develop', 'super', 'elements', 'eroticism', 'pursuit', 'capture', 'ultimate', 'submission', 'mind', 'body', 'give', 'spice', 'sex', 'sin', 'it.Zalaman', 'King', 'one', 'team', 'produced', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'soundtracks', 'Grace', 'Jones', 'Eurythmics', 'Joe', 'Cocker', 'not', 'mention', 'wonderfull', 'acting', 'skills', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'Mickey', 'cloud', 'judgement', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'star', 'packed', 'sensation', 'cut', 'masters.It', 'follws', 'technical', 'production', 'DVD', 'blue', 'blood', 'quality', 'course', 'widescreen', 'dolby', 'digital', 'etc', 'etc', 'nuff', 'said', 'story', 'hero', 'Mickey', 'meets', 'then', 'seduces', 'Elizabeth', 'Kim', 'B', 'then', 'wild', 'woderfull', 'erotic', 'journey', 'heart', 'mind', 'body', 'Elizabeth', 'not', 'understand', 'trouble', 'magical', 'mystery', 'tour', 'never', 'met', 'wealthy', 'gentle', 'caring', 'man', 'who', 'master', 'flavours', 'erotic', 'delights', 'patience', 'court', 'woo', 'gently', 'seduce', 'heroine', 'true', 'men', 'do', ""n't"", 'exist', 'so', 'want', 'reality', 'stop', 'reading', 'here', 'forget', 'DVD', 'LOL', 'erotic', 'seductions', 'scenes', 'are', 'skillfully', 'done', 'scene', 'kitchen', 'floor', 'where', 'Rourke', 'Bassinger', 'luscious', 'assortment', 'foods', 'probably', 'best', 'food', 'erotic', 'scene', 'ever', 'filmed', 'Trust', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'todays', 'actress', 'stars', 'would', 'allow', 'camera', 'get', 'close', 'Bassinger', 'did', 'literally', 'gobbling', 'up', 'dleights', 'should', 'get', 'academy', 'award', 'performance', '.Finally', 'would', 'venture', 'guess', 'most', 'men', 'would', 'not', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'patience', 'why', 'invented', 'porn', 'can', 'assure', 'are', 'woman', 'romance', 'novels', ""'ll"", 'love', 'here', 'best', 'part', 'are', 'woman', 'erotic', 'literature', 'well', 'then', 'RUN', 'mean', 'RUN', 'buy', 'DVD', 'cause', 'said', 'down', 'fabulous', 'wo', ""n't"", 'love', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'gobble', 'up']",N/A

That's your film there. Humble apologies.Both Rourke and Basinger should look fetching to their respective audiences. Their attire showcases delicious variety over all the rendezvous, ranging from wet and clingy to missing in action. Yet they traipse through their shenanigans like cyborgs, hissing much of the time and looking so painfully unsure one has an uncontrollable urge to furnish an obligatory smack on the head and a pointer to get on with it already.I'm delighted for reviewers here who found something to enjoy in this teenage fantasy yarn -- the delicate vicissitudes of romance, the subtle games thereof, the dynamics of eros, all that jazz.Frankly, this reviewer would much rather have some semblance of a story, thank you.

141679,A2Q45XI68UAQMK,0792838912,"S. Iris B. ""S. Iris B.""","[2, 2]","Well, to start, the soundtrack for this movie is great! It really takes you back to the 80s. Mickey Rourke's character was very mysterious and Kim Bassinger's character was that of a woman of the 80s when sex was on the cusp of change, on the cusp of an era where you would begin to see it and hear it more. I like Rourke's character because of the experimental nature of it. Maybe I'm into these things, maybe I'm not, but his facial expressions and demeanor were on point! Bassinger often does well in films and she did not spare this one, even at her young age. She had all the vulnerabilities of a woman and her acting was believable. Worth watching. Very intimate sex scenes. They were not porn for me, just parts of a good movie. I actually noticed the cats in the movie. I'm sure they were on purpose, but there was a cat at Bassinger's house that was sort of profound and one in the alley with a rat in his mouth when they were running from the men. There was actually a 3rd but I can't remember where. I wonder why the cats? I liked the cats, though. I liked the reggae music infused in and the song by Eurythmics blew my mind! A great 80s flick with all the elements- music, love, love-making, art, food, flea market shopping, dancing, running through the streets laughing (not so much necessary), friends, Billie Holiday. What more can you ask for? I'm sad it was only 9 1/2 weeks! They should have just gone 10! Furthermore, I always notice editing mistakes in movies and at 19:46 there is one!
