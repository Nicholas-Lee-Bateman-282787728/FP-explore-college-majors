A friend recommended the songs of Hap Palmer as the only DVDs her grandchildren liked.I looked them up but they are a little hard to find.  I managed to find this one and several others, the original, the Good Night one, and the ABC one. This particular DVD, Baby's Busy Day, is her favorite one of the bunch!The videos were obviously made a long time ago, you can tell by the clothes, the telephones, etc.  But she doesn't care, she loves the songs and she loves watching the other children on the video.  She even tries to imitate what they do.I don't want her to watch a lot of videos and TV, but it is nice to have these for when I need to occupy her while I have to make a phone call or finish a project.  They are wholesome, and even educational, and the songs are sweet and cute.I would highly recommend this DVD and the others by Hap Palmer!",5,"It's a little out of date, but my little girl doesn't care, she LOVES this DVD!",1389744000,"01 15, 2014",2014,989,"['bought', 'bunch', 'educational', 'videos', 'little', 'girl', 'never', 'paid', 'attention', 'However', 'always', 'loved', 'music', 'friend', 'recommended', 'songs', 'Hap', 'Palmer', 'only', 'DVDs', 'grandchildren', 'liked.I', 'looked', 'up', 'are', 'little', 'hard', 'find', 'managed', 'find', 'one', 'several', 'others', 'original', 'Good', 'Night', 'one', 'ABC', 'one', 'particular', 'DVD', 'Baby', 'Busy', 'Day', 'favorite', 'one', 'bunch', 'videos', 'were', 'obviously', 'made', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'can', 'tell', 'clothes', 'telephones', 'etc', ""n't"", 'care', 'songs', 'watching', 'other', 'children', 'video', 'even', 'imitate', 'what', 'do.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch', 'lot', 'videos', 'TV', 'nice', 'have', 'when', 'need', 'occupy', 'have', 'make', 'phone', 'call', 'finish', 'project', 'are', 'wholesome', 'even', 'educational', 'songs', 'are', 'sweet', 'cute.I', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'others', 'Hap', 'Palmer']",N/A

My twins (girl/boy) are now 17 months old & they have been enjoying this DVD for about 5 months already.  They love all the Baby Songs series actually...BS ""Original"" BS ""ABC,123"" BS ""Animals"", etc.  I'm not sure exactly why, but the music & the simplistic visuals of the children singing, dancing, and moving about in the video captures their attention completely.  I highly recommend this series for parents wanting some good, clean, quality video entertainment for their youngsters.

748761,A11L90R7RWJA8H,B00008WJDP,"Phil (San Diego, CA)","[0, 0]","I agree with the other poster, this is the best of the Baby Songs series. I often put DVDs into the stereo, dub the soundtracks and edit the results into songs for a kids' CD for the car. ""Baby's Busy Day"" has the catchiest tune of the series, ""Put Your Hands Up In The Air"", with a hook pleasing enough that I would expect it to make its way to a pop song sooner or later.At the birth of my son we received a gift of three Baby Songs DVDs from a family friend, a nurse who had raised her own brood. Sure enough, all three DVDs were a hit, being requested over and over. While the series may not have the artistic merit ofLinnea in Monet's GardenorLittle Laureate's For the Love of Art, what I love about this series is its warm, loving attitude.Dr. Seuss videos are enjoyable but they tend to be clever, left-brained and topical with little content about relationships. Baby Einstein is captivating but once you get past all the toy advertising and product placements, the series has zero emotional content. The Disney animations (those without Pixar) are pure glucose with little redeeming substance once you get past the industry standard production values. The rest of what passes in Hollywood for childrens entertainment borders on toxic stupidity. But the Baby Songs series time and again reinforces the warmth and love of family relationships. If a young child has to watch anything on the tube, this is the kind of mental nutrition I want for my children to help them grow.I would recommend all of the three Baby Songs DVDs we received -Original,ABC, 123, Colors & Shapes, and this one. My son, now four, sometimes sings these songs to me or with me, songs like ""Peek A Boo"" or the Baby Songs theme. Even at four he still enjoys seeing these as we play them for his younger sibling.This isn't the most polished childrens DVD series out there but gloss and polish isn't what counts for nurturing my children. The negatives are that this series looks to have originated as VHS videos from the 1980s, but I find the hairstyles and clothing of that time entertaining rather than embarrassing.",5,"I agree, the best of the Baby Songs series",1222473600,"09 27, 2008",2008,2096,"['agree', 'other', 'poster', 'best', 'Baby', 'Songs', 'series', 'often', 'put', 'DVDs', 'stereo', 'soundtracks', 'edit', 'results', 'songs', 'kids', 'CD', 'car', 'Baby', 'Busy', 'Day', 'catchiest', 'tune', 'series', 'Put', 'Hands', 'Up', 'Air', 'hook', 'pleasing', 'would', 'expect', 'make', 'way', 'pop', 'song', 'sooner', 'later.At', 'birth', 'son', 'received', 'gift', 'three', 'Baby', 'Songs', 'DVDs', 'family', 'friend', 'nurse', 'who', 'had', 'raised', 'own', 'brood', 'Sure', 'enough', 'three', 'DVDs', 'were', 'hit', 'being', 'requested', 'over', 'series', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'artistic', 'merit', 'ofLinnea', 'Monet', 'GardenorLittle', 'Laureate', 'Love', 'Art', 'what', 'love', 'series', 'warm', 'loving', 'attitude.Dr', 'Seuss', 'videos', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'tend', 'be', 'clever', 'left-brained', 'topical', 'little', 'content', 'relationships', 'Baby', 'Einstein', 'captivating', 'once', 'get', 'toy', 'advertising', 'product', 'placements', 'series', 'zero', 'emotional', 'content', 'Disney', 'animations', 'Pixar', 'are', 'pure', 'glucose', 'little', 'redeeming', 'substance', 'once', 'get', 'industry', 'standard', 'production', 'values', 'rest', 'what', 'Hollywood', 'childrens', 'entertainment', 'borders', 'toxic', 'stupidity', 'Baby', 'Songs', 'series', 'time', 'again', 'warmth', 'love', 'family', 'relationships', 'young', 'child', 'watch', 'anything', 'tube', 'kind', 'mental', 'nutrition', 'want', 'children', 'help', 'grow.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'three', 'Baby', 'Songs', 'DVDs', 'received', '-Original', 'ABC', '123', 'Colors', 'Shapes', 'one', 'My', 'son', 'now', 'four', 'sometimes', 'songs', 'songs', 'Peek', 'Boo', 'Baby', 'Songs', 'theme', 'Even', 'four', 'still', 'seeing', 'play', 'younger', 'sibling.This', ""n't"", 'most', 'polished', 'childrens', 'DVD', 'series', 'there', 'gloss', 'polish', ""n't"", 'what', 'nurturing', 'children', 'negatives', 'are', 'series', 'have', 'originated', 'VHS', 'videos', '1980s', 'find', 'hairstyles', 'clothing', 'time', 'entertaining', 'rather', 'embarrassing']",N/A
748762,A3OHFUAN0201BJ,B00008WJDP,R. Knight,"[4, 15]","We own the original Baby Songs, and though I think it is very annoying my two-year-old daughter loves it so I think it is a good thing. However, the ""green"" baby songs, ""Baby's Busy Day,"" has some video clips that are terrible. For example, in one song about ""I Can Dress Myself,"" it shows the kids dressing themselves in winter clothes in the summertime and nothing matches, and it portrays this as good, creative, and humorous. My daughter saw this and went back to her room yelling, ""Winter Clothes!"" and wanting to do the same thing. Also, there is a video with a Chimp in a high chair throwing food everywhere and of course it is portrayed as amusing. Then there is the song about ""Growing"" that inexplicably has a freaky clown in it throughout...The songs are as annoying as any of the other Baby Songs videos, but your kids WILL like them. However, with the videos on this one I cannot recommend it. Buy the original (orange) if you really want to subject yourself to annoying songs that kids will adore and ask you to play all the time, but consider yourself warned on the green one.",1,Actually Glorifies Bad Habits!,1113350400,"04 13, 2005",2005,1091,"['own', 'original', 'Baby', 'Songs', 'think', 'very', 'annoying', 'two-year-old', 'daughter', 'so', 'think', 'good', 'thing', 'However', 'green', 'baby', 'songs', 'Baby', 'Busy', 'Day', 'video', 'clips', 'are', 'terrible', 'example', 'one', 'song', 'Can', 'Dress', 'kids', 'dressing', 'winter', 'clothes', 'summertime', 'nothing', 'matches', 'good', 'creative', 'humorous', 'daughter', 'saw', 'went', 'back', 'room', 'yelling', 'Winter', 'Clothes', 'wanting', 'do', 'same', 'thing', 'Also', 'video', 'Chimp', 'high', 'chair', 'throwing', 'food', 'everywhere', 'course', 'portrayed', 'amusing', 'Then', 'song', 'Growing', 'inexplicably', 'freaky', 'clown', 'songs', 'are', 'as', 'annoying', 'other', 'Baby', 'Songs', 'videos', 'kids', 'WILL', 'like', 'However', 'videos', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'Buy', 'original', 'orange', 'really', 'want', 'subject', 'annoying', 'songs', 'kids', 'will', 'adore', 'ask', 'play', 'time', 'consider', 'warned', 'green', 'one']",N/A
