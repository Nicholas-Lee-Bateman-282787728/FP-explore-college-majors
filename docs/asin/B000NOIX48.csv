Somerset Maugham's novel comes to life in living color.  Beautiful cinematography and symphonic music embellish a wonderful, heart-warming story of love and forgiveness.Kitty (Watts) is getting older.  Living in 1920's London, her parents have more to say with impunity about her suitors.  Quick to pursue her, Walter Fane (Norton) pushes himself for courtship against her wishes, but the timing leaves her no choice but wedlock.  Interrupted in their social life, they become a foursome with Charlie Townsend (Liev Schreiber) and his wife.  Charlie, a virile alternative to her drab, doctor husband, tempts her into adultery.  In such an arrangement, women didn't have the freedoms they do now.  So when Walter is assigned to treat a cholera epidemic in Shanghai,  he's privy to her affair and can blackmail her to come along or face the scorn of divorce.  Since her lover is a playboy who abhors attachment anyway, she again has no choice.Life in China at first offers nothing more than disease and disenchantment.  Bored with her life and keeping in seclusion to avoid cholera, her husband spreads nothing but flinty resentment toward her unfaithful presence.  Besides a stunning landscape, she discovers a convent where a wise, old mother superior charms her heart and inspires her to do at first repellant work with the orphans.  Besides the dangers of disease, the locals are slow to warm up to any foreigner's presence, even one that may offer a solution to their health crisis.More moving than its beautiful cinematography, Norton's and Watt's splendid performances work well with a captivating story of lust and love, betrayal and forgiveness, and selfishness turned to self-giving.  While some viewers may find some of the old-fashioned elements of the film languorous in places, I feel the picture clocks in just right for the state of affairs.  Superbly crafted, 'Painted Veil' is complete with a heart-melting beauty for the soul as well as for the eyes.",5,'Painted Veil' Is Beautiful,1171152000,"02 11, 2007",2007,2029,"['Co-produced', 'co-starring', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'W.', 'Somerset', 'Maugham', 'novel', 'life', 'living', 'color', 'Beautiful', 'cinematography', 'symphonic', 'music', 'embellish', 'wonderful', 'heart-warming', 'story', 'love', 'forgiveness.Kitty', 'Watts', 'getting', 'older', 'Living', '1920', 'London', 'parents', 'have', 'more', 'say', 'impunity', 'suitors', 'Quick', 'pursue', 'Walter', 'Fane', 'Norton', 'courtship', 'wishes', 'timing', 'choice', 'wedlock', 'Interrupted', 'social', 'life', 'become', 'foursome', 'Charlie', 'Townsend', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'wife', 'Charlie', 'virile', 'alternative', 'drab', 'doctor', 'husband', 'tempts', 'adultery', 'such', 'arrangement', 'women', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'freedoms', 'do', 'now', 'So', 'when', 'Walter', 'assigned', 'treat', 'cholera', 'epidemic', 'Shanghai', 'privy', 'affair', 'can', 'blackmail', 'come', 'along', 'face', 'scorn', 'divorce', 'lover', 'playboy', 'who', 'attachment', 'anyway', 'again', 'choice.Life', 'China', 'first', 'offers', 'nothing', 'more', 'disease', 'disenchantment', 'Bored', 'life', 'keeping', 'seclusion', 'avoid', 'cholera', 'husband', 'nothing', 'flinty', 'resentment', 'unfaithful', 'presence', 'stunning', 'landscape', 'convent', 'where', 'wise', 'old', 'mother', 'superior', 'heart', 'do', 'first', 'repellant', 'work', 'orphans', 'dangers', 'disease', 'locals', 'are', 'slow', 'warm', 'up', 'foreigner', 'presence', 'even', 'one', 'may', 'offer', 'solution', 'health', 'crisis.More', 'moving', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'Norton', 'Watt', 'splendid', 'performances', 'work', 'well', 'captivating', 'story', 'lust', 'love', 'betrayal', 'forgiveness', 'selfishness', 'turned', 'self-giving', 'viewers', 'may', 'find', 'old-fashioned', 'elements', 'film', 'languorous', 'places', 'feel', 'picture', 'just', 'right', 'state', 'affairs', 'Superbly', 'crafted', ""'Painted"", 'Veil', 'complete', 'heart-melting', 'beauty', 'soul', 'as', 'well', 'eyes']","PAINTED VEIL, THE (WS) (DVD)"

1058315,A1S26JXPQKFVPI,B000NOIX48,Alexander Arsov,"[3, 3]","===Warning: Spoilers Ahead!===I have never understood the passion for comparisons between movies and books, especially when the former is based on the latter which, meanwhile, have acquired something like classical status. The operative word is ""based"". Very few movies are really adaptations in the strict sense of the word; even filmed plays, which retain much of the original dialogue, are often just ""based"", and vaguely at that, on the originals. This is as it should be. The mediums are entirely different and so are the final results. Film-makers are at their perfect liberty to alter anything they like, no matter how great a classic their source may be. The finished product is a work of art that must stand or fall on its own, not on the ground of dubious comparisons which are the lowest form of criticism (indeed, an eloquent proof that critical faculty is absent).To cut the long story short, the 2006 movie ""The Painted Veil"" is a very fine piece of cinematic art, even though it bears little resemblance to Maugham's eponymous novel, first published in 1925. Let's look at some intriguing differences and try to explain why, though I prefer the novel by far, I also enjoy the movie a lot. Let me first repeat that if you haven't seen/read either, I am going to ""spoil"" both for you.Just about all the novel and the movie share are the names of the characters and the basic elements of the plot. These are by far the least important elements. Maugham is often regarded as a great storyteller, but the fact is that his works are much more about characters than about plots. The mainspring of ""The Painted Veil"" is Kitty's remarkable spiritual growth from a silly, superficial girl to a mature woman of the world. This is - broadly speaking - retained in the movie. But there are several important differences.The movie deals much more extensively with the Kitty-Walter relationship. Perhaps expectedly, considering it was designed for the big screen, it is much more personal and romantic. Yet the screenplay artfully avoids sentimentality, which is highly commendable, and there is more than enough food for thought in between. The pace is excellent, with a fine balance between dramatic and more introverted episodes, and the viewer's sense of plausibility is never outraged.It's a hell of a lot more complex in the novel; be sure you won't find any marked reconciliation here, much less any growing passion between Walter and Kitty. He did play an indirect role in her awakening and transformation, yet he remained callous to the end, indeed almost cruel as his last words, the famous quotation ""It was the dog that died"", suggest. Kitty herself came out with completely different views on the whole of humanity, not just her own husband. But this is not the place to discuss the novel alone!To take but one further example, Kitty's falling again in the end, albeit for a very short while this time, under Charlie's charms is one of the most controversial moments in the novel. In the movie this is replaced with a delightful snub to her ex-lover, much more conventional yet much more effecting on the screen. Many have regarded the episode in the novel as highly improbable, even suggesting that Kitty's new outlook is sham. I don't see it that way. On the contrary: it makes her character more plausible, more human. It seems unlikely to me that she should have overcome her older self so quickly and so completely. In contrast, the movie's ending is the more improbable one, but does it matter as long as it's dramatically effective without being utterly fantastical?On its own the movie has very few weaknesses. The sets and especially the shots on location are stupendous, marvellously evocative feast for the eye. The soundtrack is gorgeous, with wistful piano solos that complement Kitty's doubts to perfection. The script uses many lines from Maugham's flawless and dramatically exciting dialogue. It flows smoothly and makes a nice elaboration on, or boldly invents, ""action"" episodes like the uprising or the building of the water canal. There are several lovely bits of humour which are original. My favourites are Waddington's accepting the record from Kitty with the words ""Oh, Stravinsky. Very modern."" and Walter's assistant mixing martini in the lab. Now that was hilarious. The direction is imaginative without being obtrusive.The cast is brilliant, my only disappointment being Liev Schreiber as a dull Charlie Townsend; someone more handsome, more dashing, more debonair should have been better. But Edward and Naomi are well-nigh perfect in the two main roles. Characterization and especially character development are especially difficult to be shown convincingly on the screen. But when you have a fine screenplay and a talented cast, it is obviously possible. Among the supporting players Toby Jones steals the show as the handsomely ugly Waddington, full of worldly wisdom and good humour. The aged and hard to recognise Diana Rigg is a superb Mother Superior (23 years ago she played Regan againstKing Learof Laurence Olivier).All in all, an excellent movie on virtually all fronts. To my mind, it is less complex and less compelling than the novel, but that is neither here nor there. All changes are equally legitimate, no matter what one may think of them. It is not an adaptation of Maugham's novel. It is rather an elaboration on similar plot lines but using different characters towards different ends.",5,"On books, movies and the relation - or lack of such - between them",1356480000,"12 26,

1058316,AGEIT17HENDIS,B000NOIX48,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","Several years ago I reviewed a film, Reds, about the torrid love affair between pre-World War I radical journalists John Reed and Louise Bryant where the Russian revolution of 1917 was used a backdrop for much of the story line. I commented then that that approach had the focus in reverse of what was compelling about the film, the love affair small against the backdrop of the great historic event that swept the pair up in its wake. I then stepped back and went on to tip my hat to the right of an artist to use whatever creative license was at hand in order to tell his or her story. Those same sentiments apply here where the film under review, a film based on British author W. Somerset Maugham's novel of the same name, The Painted Veil, tells the story of another tortured love affair set against the backdrop of the Chinese revolution of 1925-27. Except here the revolution is even more of a background echo.Of course the period in question, in the aftermath of the decimation of the flower of British youth of all classes in the devastation of World War I, is the period of the slow decline of the British Empire. That empire however still included a not unimportant outpost in tumultuous China. And the bulk of this story takes place there. And a rather old-fashioned Victorian story it is. A younger daughter of the upper-middle class under pressure to get married (and married properly, but mainly married), played by Naomi Watts, and a British civil servant doctor stationed in that British outpost in Shanghai and in need of a wife, played by Edward Norton, meet in London, get married despite barely knowing each other and leave for China. However , as is plain, this is not a marriage made in heaven, no way. Like many such arrangements it is merely a matter of convenience.And that mismatch, that inevitable tension, is just the kind of plot line that Maugham was good at in previous efforts of his that I have viewed (and also read) The Razor's Edge and the more famous Of Human Bondage. The pair are trapped in a no man's land so, of course, someone has to stray off the reservation. In this case Ms. Watts has an affair with another British civil servant in order to get out from under. Said British civil servant already is married, very married, and in no mood to get divorced. Such stories clutter all of literature although not all are filled with perfidious civil servants with meal ticket wives as an excuse.Naturally Mr. Norton stumbles onto the affair, ruefully offers a divorce under conditions that cannot be met, and so the unhappy couple are held together by some unholy glue as they are off to the outback in order to stem a cholera epidemic.

1058322,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000NOIX48,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","One of the first things you'll notice about `The Painted Veil' is it's crisp beauty and elegance.  It's effortlessly filmed with such expansive grandeur it's impossible not to become enthralled in its scenery, both human and atmospheric.  The next thing you're sure to realize is that young Naomi Watts is sure to be one of our finest working actresses, for with every subtle movement of her facial features, her graceful fingertips or any other part of her beautifully constructed body she gives off the essence of brilliance, portraying the exact emotion we need to understand and cultivating in herself and in her audience a trust within this woman that begs to be established.  She effortlessly moves in and out of her emotions with such skill it's astonishing to me she was utterly ignored throughout awards season.There is so much more to love and appreciate within this fabulous film, but it rests on the shoulders of the beautiful backdrop and the even more beautiful Watts to carry us to a place we would otherwise never venture.The film, which is based on the novel written by W. Somerset Maugham, centers around the marriage and relationship between Walter and Kitty Fane.  Walter is a very shy bacteriologist who pursues Kitty's hand despite the fact that Kitty herself is not fairly interested.  Peer pressure from her family and that aching feeling of failure push Kitty into a marriage she is not invested in and soon her longing for real love leads her into adultery with married Charlie.  After uncovering her tryst Walter gives Kitty some options.  Walter has volunteered to help a small town ravaged by a severe cholera epidemic.  Kitty must either come with him or he will publicly divorce her.  Her only suitable (by her terms) way out would be to have Charlie agree to divorce his wife and marry her.  He of course declines the idea and Kitty is forced to accompany Walter.Upon their arrival Kitty is appalled with their new living conditions, frightened even, and the growing distance between Walter and herself is making the transition all the more difficult.  `The Painted Veil' ultimately is about growth and understanding and the power of love overcoming all.  Kitty married a man for whom she had no love for, a man whom she really didn't even know and understand, but watching him in his element, helping all these people, fighting for their health and survival helped Kitty to realize that she respected him and ultimately she falls in love with him.  He helps her become a better person and likewise she helps him become a more desirable person.  `The Painted Veil' succeeds beautifully in creating a love story for the ages.Aside from the magnificent `Oscar Worthy' Watts there are quite a few very strong performances within this film.  Edward Norton, who co-produced this film, turns out yet another powerful performance as Walter.  Norton is one of my favorite actors for he always invests himself so deeply in his performances.  He had a very strong year in 2006 with `The Painted Veil' following `The Illusionist' and `Down in the Valley', each performance just as strong as the next.  Here he beautifully captures the heart of this man, broken and depressed realizing the woman he loves has disregarded him, and the barriers he builds for himself to protect the dignity he has left is nothing short of wholeheartedly believable and relatable.  Toby Jones, better known as `the other Capote' turns in a key performance as the Fane's neighbor, and Diana Rigg is just superb as the runner of the orphanage where Kitty finds her redemption.Aside from Watts though I feel the star of this film is none other than director John Curran who infuses so much life and atmosphere into this film that the audience is drawn in from the very beginning.  He captures so brilliantly the time and era, his surroundings but most importantly the emotions of his characters.  `The Painted Veil' truly is a near perfect film, one that is sure to find a place in your heart and make an impact on your very soul.",5,"Breathtaking in almost every respect, a near perfect film to fall in love with...",1187049600,"08 14, 2007",2007,4027,"['One', 'first', 'things', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'Painted', 'Veil', 'crisp', 'beauty', 'elegance', 'effortlessly', 'filmed', 'such', 'expansive', 'grandeur', 'impossible', 'not', 'become', 'enthralled', 'scenery', 'human', 'atmospheric', 'next', 'thing', ""'re"", 'sure', 'realize', 'young', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'sure', 'be', 'one', 'finest', 'working', 'actresses', 'subtle', 'movement', 'facial', 'features', 'graceful', 'fingertips', 'other', 'part', 'beautifully', 'constructed', 'body', 'essence', 'brilliance', 'portraying', 'exact', 'emotion', 'need', 'understand', 'cultivating', 'herself', 'audience', 'trust', 'woman', 'be', 'established', 'effortlessly', 'emotions', 'such', 'skill', 'astonishing', 'was', 'utterly', 'ignored', 'awards', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'love', 'appreciate', 'fabulous', 'film', 'shoulders', 'beautiful', 'backdrop', 'even', 'more', 'beautiful', 'Watts', 'carry', 'place', 'would', 'otherwise', 'never', 'venture.The', 'film', 'based', 'novel', 'written', 'W.', 'Somerset', 'Maugham', 'centers', 'marriage', 'relationship', 'Walter', 'Kitty', 'Fane', 'Walter', 'very', 'shy', 'bacteriologist', 'who', 'Kitty', 'hand', 'fact', 'Kitty', 'not', 'fairly', 'interested', 'Peer', 'pressure', 'family', 'aching', 'feeling', 'failure', 'push', 'Kitty', 'marriage', 'not', 'invested', 'soon', 'longing', 'real', 'love', 'adultery', 'married', 'Charlie', 'uncovering', 'tryst', 'Walter', 'Kitty', 'options', 'Walter', 'volunteered', 'help', 'small', 'town', 'ravaged', 'severe', 'cholera', 'epidemic', 'Kitty', 'must', 'come', 'will', 'publicly', 'divorce', 'only', 'suitable', 'terms', 'way', 'out', 'would', 'be', 'have', 'Charlie', 'agree', 'divorce', 'wife', 'marry', 'course', 'idea', 'Kitty', 'forced', 'accompany', 'Walter.Upon', 'arrival', 'Kitty', 'appalled', 'new', 'living', 'conditions', 'frightened', 'even', 'growing', 'distance', 'Walter', 'making', 'transition', 'more', 'difficult', 'Painted', 'Veil', 'ultimately', 'growth', 'understanding', 'power', 'love', 'overcoming', 'Kitty', 'married', 'man', 'whom', 'had', 'love', 'man', 'whom', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'understand', 'watching', 'element', 'helping', 'people', 'fighting', 'health', 'survival', 'helped', 'Kitty', 'realize', 'respected', 'ultimately', 'love', 'become', 'better', 'person', 'likewise', 'become', 'more', 'desirable', 'person', 'Painted', 'Veil', 'beautifully', 'creating', 'love', 'story', 'ages.Aside', 'magnificent', 'Oscar', 'Worthy', 'Watts', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'very', 'strong', 'performances', 'film', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'who', 'co-produced', 'film', 'out', 'yet', 'powerful', 'performance', 'Walter', 'Norton', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'always', 'so', 'deeply', 'performances', 'had', 'very', 'strong', 'year', '2006', 'Painted', 'Veil', 'following', 'Illusionist', 'Down', 'Valley', 'performance', 'just', 'as', 'strong', 'next', 'Here', 'beautifully', 'heart', 'man', 'broken', 'depressed', 'realizing', 'woman', 'disregarded', 'barriers', 'protect', 'dignity', 'left', 'nothing', 'short', 'wholeheartedly', 'believable', 'relatable', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'better', 'known', 'other', 'Capote', 'turns', 'key', 'performance', 'Fane', 'neighbor', 'Diana', 'Rigg', 'just', 'superb', 'runner', 'orphanage', 'where', 'Kitty', 'redemption.Aside', 'Watts', 'feel', 'star', 'film', 'none', 'other', 'director', 'John', 'Curran', 'who', 'so', 'much', 'life', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'audience', 'drawn', 'very', 'beginning', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'time', 'era', 'surroundings', 'most', 'importantly', 'emotions', 'characters', 'Painted', 'Veil', 'truly', 'near', 'perfect', 'film', 'one', 'sure', 'find', 'place', 'heart', 'make', 'impact', 'very', 'soul']","PAINTED VEIL, THE (WS) (DVD)"

Their trip to the cholera-infested regions of China amounts to the equivalent (expressed well in another review) of a joint suicide pact...though Watts' character can hardly be called a willing partner at mission outset.The real stars here are Director John Curran and Cinematographer Stuart Dryburgh.

The dynamics shift from shy and respectful to tense and angry. Norton, while half the film he barely speaks, does a great job because we see how kind a man he is, but also how hurt.

But occasionally one will come along and surprise the hell out of you. Such is the case with THE PAINTED VEIL.Lead actors Edward Norton and Naomi Watts must've seen ...something in the film's script that brought them on-board not only as actors, but also as producers. In no small part is the success of this film due to these two but also because of the setting: China. Cinematographer Stuart Dryburgh ofThe Pianofame puts China's beautiful landscape to work for the film, not forcing or lingering on artistic shots, but letting the stunning background draw viewers' eyes calmly into the world around the actors. This was a huge bonus, something that struck me as effortless artwork on his part.The script itself also seems effortless in subject matter, but it is this slightness that gives the entire production an amazing quality not normally seen in films. This story covers the lives of Kitty (Naomi Watts,King Kong, 2005) and Walter (Edward Norton,The Illusionist), a married couple with a stolid marriage. Kitty is the spoiled rich girl of an elitist family. Her mother hopes to marry her off to a somewhat well-off husband and when Walter, an infectious disease specialist, arrives on the scene, Kitty and he are thrown together in 1925 London. A marriage quickly ensues. But when Walter gets transferred to Shanghai, cracks in their relationship begin to show as Kitty finds excitement in the arms of another man, a married diplomat named Charlie (Liev Schreiber,The Manchurian Candidate, 2004). When Walter finds out about it, he does something wildly unexpected: he moves himself and Kitty into China's cholera epidemic. With Walter's threat of divorce and ridicule hanging over Kitty's head, she accepts his move ...especially after learning that Charlie (her paramour) doesn't care for her like she thought he did.Kitty's lack of love for Walter hits him hard and he buries himself in his work once they arrive at the cholera-infected town. He transfers his love for his wife into his love for his work, caring for the sick and dying (especially the children) while riding recklessly through the disease-riddled area. He quickly encounters battles with the townsfolk who believe his coming there was a bad omen. Eastern superstition battles Western medicine and with the assistance of a communist soldier names Colonel Yu (Anthony Wong Chau-Sang), he forms a tenuous relationship between slowing the epidemic and helping maintain the Chinese culture.Kitty soon learns that Walter is becoming more and more respected in the area, and she eventually volunteers to help care for the sick too (without Walter's knowledge, initially). Distant husband and lonely wife begin seeing each other during their treatment, and each learns much about the other. Walter finds that he can forgive his wife for her infidelity and for his own mismanagement of their marriage. Kitty grows up and learns that being the wife of a respectable doctor isn't such a bore after all. Love grows, but like a beautiful flower, it is often most fragrant and colorful right before it dies.The ending sequence between Watts and Norton are what great film is all about. The lighting, the acting, the set, the crushing emotion, all play a pitch-perfect role.You'd be hard-pressed to find another film so finely done in 2006.

Driven by boredom and a loveless marriage - loveless on Kitty's part - she commits adultery with a charming diplomat.  With the discovery of his wife's adultery Dr. Walter takes his unwilling wife to the central part of the deadly cholera epidemic.  And there the love story begins.This movie is one of the few recent movies that I saw that did not disappoint my expectations.  I believe that a `true' love story - love stories that are not only trying to be cute but really portray the love that we experience in real life - should reflect realities honestly and accurately.  And this I believe cannot be accomplished merely by good acting and directing but with the right team.  Norton and Watts was such a team.The choice of the backdrop of this love story could not have been more odd - a cholera infested China town.

1058356,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B000NOIX48,C. B Collins Jr.,"[1, 1]","There are some films that are so good, that I hesitate to review them since any review would come short in conveying the exceptional quality of the production. The Painted Veil is this type of film. It just could not be better. The acting is superb.  The Chinese scenery and settings, the costumes (especially for Naomi Watts), and the art direction are of the highest quality. The music, often offering us variations of Eric Satie's compositions, complimented the feeling of the remote Chinese countryside. Yet it is the underlying novel by W. Somerset Maugham and the terse screenplay presented here, that is the bedrock upon which this excellent production is built.The storyline weaves a tale of ever changing relationships and the bonds created, broken, and recreated. Kitty is a spoiled, bored, self-centered yet beautiful young woman who lives with her parents. She is a bit late in selecting a husband and her parents become increasingly biting and pushy in their comments that she should marry. A young infectious disease specialist, Walter Fine, comes to a family party, where he falls for Kitty. Beside beauty and physical grace, she has an off-handed frankness that could be seen as attractive. Walter falls for her and she is casually amused by him. However her mother's overbearing nature eventually helps tip the scales and Kitty marries this shy, bright, but naive young man. Since he is in the public health division of the English civil service, he is soon assigned to Shanghai China and Kitty must go with him. She is soon bored and they find they have little in common. He reads and studies and she plays cards and games. He does his best to amuse her. He is a bit shy in regard to love making, preferring to make love in the dark. The stage is being set for a major problem. The problem arrives with an invitation to the Vice-Consul's home for a dinner party. Here Kitty meets charming Charlie (played well by Liv Schreiber)and soon becomes his lover. Walter comes home unexpectedly and hears them making love behind her locked bedroom door. He leaves a record album he has purchased for her beside the door, a simple message to her that he knows what she has done. Dr. Fine accepts a terrible risky assignment to go deep into the Chinese countryside to deal with a cholera epidemic. He tells Kitty she must come too. She refuses. He then tells her that he will begin divorce proceedings the next day. In 1925 a woman divorced by her husband for adultery would ruin her social and economic status and stability. She is really forced into the situation of going into a disease infested remote area. She tries to get Charlie to divorce his wife and marry her, but he will have none of it and thus Kitty sees that he is a handsome and charming playboy, but has no intention of disrupting the relationship with his rich, sophisticated wife.Thus Kitty agrees to go with Walter in a bleak pact that has a feeling of mutual destruction. It is in this backwater site of poverty and disease that the husband and wife actually begin to know each other. Walter has come to the conclusion that Kitty is terminally shallow, bored, spoiled, and self absorbed. However a series of events, some tragic, begin to unfold that both allow Kitty to develop beyond her own self-centeredness and to discover within herself some self worth based on service to others.Toby Jones plays a remote English official who reveals to Kitty the reality of her relationship with Charlie, a superficial tryst and not a life long commitment. Diana Rigg is superb as the French Mother Superior of a Catholic school, hospital, and orphanage, who guides Kitty gently toward self examination, commitment to others rather than to oneself, and eventually to the talents and intellectual compassion of her husband.Here the themes of the film become almost profound as it explores whether it is possible to fall in love with the underlying goodness of a person.  Kitty gradually begins to appreciate the dedication of her husband to public health and the masses suffering from infectious diseases. However, despite his busy and demanding life, Dr. Fine begins to appreciate Kitty's growing dedication to the French nuns and the work in the orphanage school. As their appreciation for each other grows, tensions between Chinese nationalists and the English also grow and erupt violently. Walter saves Kitty from a band of Chinese ruffians. It is here that Kitty discovers she is two months pregnant and the father is probably Charlie, not Walter.  They have reconciled enough at this point that he accepts this fact and Walter really forgives any and all of Kitty's past indiscretions. Yet at this time his public health strategies have begun to turn the tide on the cholera epidemic and the death rate drops dramatically in the village. Unfortunately good news spreads and the people from a neighboring village also stricken by Cholera invade the village and must be pushed back into a refugee camp. Here Walter works to bring the disease under control but becomes ill himself. Kitty comes to the refugee camp and nurses Walter, but it is impossible to keep him hydrated. He awakens from his coma and calls to her, she is sleeping beside him, and he asks for her forgiveness. At this point we see that he has also grown, for he has moved from the victimized husband with the unfaithful wife to a realization that he has pulled them both into a suicide mission and he has assumed he can punish her for the pain she caused him. It is now Walter than needs forgiveness. The film is excellent in teaching us that when the victim becomes the oppressor that they must first overcome the pain and righteous indignation before they can begin to empathize with those they have decided to punish. The final step is more sublime for after empathy can come the final step of realization that we all are capable of victimizing and oppressing others in the name of revenge and to justify our pain. Asking for forgiveness breaks the cycle. Walter breaks the cycle and releases Kitty to be fully human.Bravo for such an excellent and moving film. The entire production takes Maugham's fantastic novel and polishes it into a glowing gem, possibly the best film made in 2007.",5,The finest film for adults made in 2007,1208649600,"04 20,

Adapted from Somerset Maugham's 1925 novel and starring Edward Norton, Naomi Watts, and a bravely makeup-eschewing Diana Rigg, The Painted Veil tells us of Walter Fane, a young doctor (so many of Maugham's characters were doctors) who falls in love with Kitty Garstin, a beautiful woman from a moneyed family, who impulsively weds the doctor in order to both escape and punish her callous mother. Soon finding herself re-located along with her husband to Shanghai, Kitty is stranded on the far side of the world amid unfamiliar people and places, married to a man she does not love and with whom she has virtually nothing in common. In the wake of his wife's eventual affair with a caddish playboy, Dr. Fane forces Kitty to move with him once more, this time into the primitive countryside of the Chinese interior, where a cholera epidemic is taking human life in appalling numbers long unseen back in Europe. Where once he had been filled with passionate love for Kitty, Walter now hates himself for ever loving her, and treats Kitty with punitive coldness and disdain. Isolated, facing horrors nothing in either of their pasts has prepared them for, the couple enter an existence which tries the human spirit, and recreates each of them into something greater than either could once ever have been. Maugham's story of romantic love, betrayal, redemption and higher love is magnificently unfolded here in one of the more worthwhile novel-to-screen productions of the decade.

I found the film to be a rich and rewarding experience, in that it demonstrated--and quite efficiently--redemptive love and forgiveness--and this after extreme betrayal was effected within the bonds of marriage. Without giving too much of the plot away (for those who haven't read the novel by W. Somerset Maugham) the film opens in 1920s China, in a rural province--the movie was filmed on location, thanks to the efforts of the filmmakers, who took it upon themselves to jump through various hoops to obtain all of the permits necessary to film in the country (a feat not achieved for an American-funded film in many years, as far as I know). A seemingly unhappy couple fills the first few frames, and we immediately get their back-story.Dr. Walter Fane (Edward Norton) is enamored with Kitty (Naomi Watts), the daughter of an affluent family, by all appearances, who he meets at a gala. Not much time passes before he asks the young beauty to marry him and return with him to Shanghai, where he holds a civil position as a scientist. Kitty is taken aback by his sudden boldness and is initially reluctant, until she overhears a telephone conversation her mother has with a friend, wherein she says--regarding Kitty's marriage prospects--""Oh, I gave up on Kitty long ago."" To escape the clutches of her overbearing mother, Kitty sets off to Shanghai with her new husband, but as blissful as the marriage seems in the beginning, things immediately go wrong.For reasons I will not divulge, the nave Kitty is forced to travel with her husband to a remote region of China, where he has decided to volunteer his services in the fight against a cholera outbreak, as the disease has wreaked havoc and devastation on this part of the country. It is here that the film explores the deepest aspects of the two lead characters, and it is here that the healing process begins. We learn, along with the unhappy couple, that they were expecting things of each other that neither of them possessed in the first place; and each desired something in the other that that person couldn't supply. But eventually, the two learn to accept each other for who they are; and the connection between them soon becomes solid, and unmistakable. I should say that there is one crucial plot point--which carries us into the Third Act--that will conveniently upset the calm and keep us riveted until the final moments play out.The performances are brilliant and highly believable, but this is more of an art house film than anything, so the average moviegoer will be sorely disappointed if he or she is expecting otherwise. The cinematography is breathtaking, and exquisite views of actual mainland China, with its distinctive misty mountain ranges, fill the background of many establishing shots. The set designers decided on various muted earth tones for many of the interior settings, and this causes the viewer to focus on the players moving about in the foreground, but whether this is in keeping with the period or not, I do not know. What I can say is that it works. I only mention this because many films that are set in the Orient tend to be extremely colorful, and this film is not, which is refreshing, as the subject matter and themes do not call for it.",5,Quality Period Piece,1328918400,"02 11, 2012",2012,3343,"['what', 'worth', 'wish', 'film', 'could', 'live', 'up', 'designation', 'being', 'instant', 'classic', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'rich', 'rewarding', 'experience', 'demonstrated', 'quite', 'efficiently', 'redemptive', 'love', 'forgiveness', 'extreme', 'betrayal', 'was', 'effected', 'bonds', 'marriage', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'plot', 'away', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'novel', 'W.', 'Somerset', 'Maugham', 'film', '1920s', 'China', 'rural', 'province', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'location', 'thanks', 'efforts', 'filmmakers', 'who', 'took', 'jump', 'various', 'hoops', 'obtain', 'permits', 'necessary', 'film', 'country', 'feat', 'not', 'achieved', 'American-funded', 'film', 'many', 'years', 'as', 'far', 'know', 'seemingly', 'unhappy', 'couple', 'first', 'few', 'frames', 'immediately', 'get', 'back-story.Dr', 'Walter', 'Fane', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'enamored', 'Kitty', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'daughter', 'affluent', 'family', 'appearances', 'who', 'gala', 'Not', 'much', 'time', 'passes', 'young', 'beauty', 'marry', 'return', 'Shanghai', 'where', 'civil', 'position', 'scientist', 'Kitty', 'taken', 'aback', 'sudden', 'boldness', 'initially', 'reluctant', 'telephone', 'conversation', 'mother', 'friend', 'regarding', 'Kitty', 'marriage', 'prospects', 'Oh', 'gave', 'up', 'Kitty', 'long', 'ago', 'escape', 'clutches', 'overbearing', 'mother', 'Kitty', 'Shanghai', 'new', 'husband', 'as', 'blissful', 'marriage', 'beginning', 'things', 'immediately', 'go', 'wrong.For', 'reasons', 'will', 'not', 'divulge', 'nave', 'Kitty', 'forced', 'travel', 'husband', 'remote', 'region', 'China', 'where', 'decided', 'volunteer', 'services', 'fight', 'cholera', 'outbreak', 'disease', 'wreaked', 'havoc', 'devastation', 'part', 'country', 'here', 'film', 'deepest', 'aspects', 'two', 'lead', 'characters', 'here', 'healing', 'process', 'learn', 'unhappy', 'couple', 'were', 'expecting', 'things', 'other', 'possessed', 'first', 'place', 'desired', 'something', 'other', 'person', 'could', ""n't"", 'supply', 'eventually', 'two', 'learn', 'accept', 'other', 'who', 'are', 'connection', 'soon', 'solid', 'unmistakable', 'should', 'say', 'one', 'crucial', 'plot', 'point', 'Third', 'Act', 'will', 'conveniently', 'upset', 'calm', 'keep', 'riveted', 'final', 'moments', 'play', 'out.The', 'performances', 'are', 'brilliant', 'highly', 'believable', 'more', 'art', 'house', 'film', 'anything', 'average', 'moviegoer', 'will', 'be', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'expecting', 'otherwise', 'cinematography', 'breathtaking', 'exquisite', 'views', 'actual', 'mainland', 'China', 'distinctive', 'misty', 'mountain', 'fill', 'background', 'many', 'establishing', 'shots', 'set', 'designers', 'decided', 'various', 'muted', 'earth', 'tones', 'many', 'interior', 'settings', 'viewer', 'focus', 'players', 'moving', 'about', 'foreground', 'keeping', 'period', 'not', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'What', 'can', 'say', 'only', 'mention', 'many', 'films', 'are', 'set', 'Orient', 'tend', 'be', 'extremely', 'colorful', 'film', 'not', 'refreshing', 'subject', 'matter', 'themes', 'do', 'not', 'call']","PAINTED VEIL, THE (WS) (DVD)"

1058378,A3DGVB3T5QJNRE,B000NOIX48,Danny G.,"[5, 30]","It's obvious The Painted Veil is geared to people who are fairly educated. Baltimore is a fairly large city, and only one small theater that I'm aware of showed this movie! So I find it hard to believe the filmmakers, in their infinite wisdom, needed to show extremely graphic images of people dying of Cholera, not to mention grotesque scenes of corpses, to the very people who already have a pretty good idea about what dying from Cholera is all about.As a result of being caught off guard by these rather gruesome images, I literally lost my dinner after the movie was over. Where do I send the bill? Can anything be left to the imagination, anymore? Why are so many films these days so morbid? Is the movie going public becoming so desensitized that nothing is shocking? Are American filmmakers helping to turn us into a nation of mindless voyeurs? If I wanted, or needed, to learn more about Cholera, all I have to do is hop on the Internet, or God-forbid, pick-up a book, and read. I didn't need to spend my hard earned money to be nauseated!All I can say is thank God for the scientist who invented the purification process for public drinking water - he should be nominated for sainthood! And the next time you gripe about your Government spending money on foreign aid in very poor countries, keep this movie in mind!

1058379,ASQ8KNNP3A7FP,B000NOIX48,"Danusha V. Goska ""Save Send Delete""","[6, 7]","2006' ""The Painted Veil"" has so much going for it, it should have been another ""English Patient"" -- a retro romance that sweeps awards and captures hearts.Instead we have that most frustrating creature -- a very, very good movie that just misses the mark of greatness.Even so - if you like period romances, you may love what is lovable in this movie enough to forgive it its flaws.What ""The Painted Veil"" has going for it:1.) The plot of the Somerset Maughm novel. A nerdy, scientific, cuckolded husband, who knows his beautiful, shallow, society wife married him because she was dangerously close to being an old maid and wanted to get away from her mother, punishes her for an affair by taking her to a remote Chinese cholera epidemic. Yawza! How operatic!2.) Sky-high production values. ""The Painted Veil"" was filmed on location in China. Locations were mixed and matched. At one point they were along the Li River, among Guilin's famous karst scenery. Karst is the ""lumpy"" looking limestone topography. Towers rise abruptly, and weirdly,  out of river valleys, fringed by lush rice paddies and bamboo. The village Huang Yao is a five-hundred years old, intact Ming Dynasty town.3.) Edward Norton is perfection. He gives Walter everything he needs -- as the nerdy, scientist cuckold husband, Walter is, by turns, arrogant, insecure, vengeful, loving, sweet, icy cold, naive, calculating ... you see it all on his face, and fear him, feel for him, and forgive him.4.) Alexandre Desplat's award-winning score. Minimalist, and yet it conveys the plot's sense of entrapped passions and spiritual dimensions. Very good use is made of Eric Satie's Gnossienne # 1 and ""A La Claire Fontaine,"" a French folksong whose bittersweet lyrics, which can be found on the web, are so appropriate to the plot that they are heartbreaking.5.) Diminutive blond Toby Jones' depiction of Waddington, a British provincial officer who is just barely keeping up appearances, in his day old stubble, shabby, sweat-stained suits, and live-in Chinese lover, young enough to be his daughter. Jones pumps this small role full of life. In another actor's hands Waddington would have been forgetable; with Jones, he's one of the most interesting features of the movie.6.) The Love / Sex / Death / Religion / Self-Sacrifice nexus that modern pop culture doesn't even seem to realize exists; any work of art that reminds us that what we love is mortal and that God and Sex live next door to each other in our brains / souls / lives is way ahead of the pack.7.) A scene from a Chinese opera. A vermilion and turquoise costume. Lin Zheng's brilliant performance.8.) Anthony Wong as Colonel Yu. Again, a minor part, but Wong is riveting.What I wish had been different:1.) Liev Schreiber has an unmistakable earnestness that just doesn't work for him to be believable as a rake, cad, and bounder. He was much better as the earnest, befuddled cuckold in ""Walk on the Moon.""2.) Naomi Watts. She's very pretty and very sweet and I just never, ever believed her as a shallow, devastatingly beautiful socialite who could drive two men to irresponsible action.I kept thinking of Greta Garbo in the original ""Painted Veil,"" or Vivien Leigh as that insufferable monster, Scarlett -- as much as you hate her, you are fascinated. Not so with Watts.3.) John Curran's direction. This is a MELODRAMA, John. Walter says, ""I despise myself for loving you."" Kitty says, ""If a man doesn't have what it takes to make a woman love him, that's his fault."" I mean, how can you direct that so anemically?

This version, released in January of 2007, tells the story of a young woman, Kitty Fane, compellingly played by Naomi Watts, who has carefully avoided the painful job of growing up and acting like an adult.Events conspire that compel her to move to China with her new husband, Dr. Walter Fane, played by Edward Norton, at a time when China was becoming increasingly involved in a  shift from war lords to a stronger national government. Along with that shift, a cholera epidemic demands her husband's full attention leaving Kitty to fend for herself which she does rather badly. After making her fair share of mistakes, Kitty begins to realize her need to grow up and start looking beyond her own needs and wants.The scenery is both striking and alien looking; the filming took place in China. The acting and general ambience of the movie holds the viewers attention and creates an impression of depth and scope. The story was well crafted and made one feel the hand of a master literary craftsman had been involved in its creation.Sadly there are no special features on this disc; one would think the making of this movie would deserve a lot of special attention and open many doors for interesting background information, but there is nothing on the making of this movie.The movie is serious, intense, and very dramatic; although it is only rated PG-13 I would consider carefully before letting it be viewed by young children.",5,A Fascinating Epic Story,1400716800,"05 22, 2014",2014,1517,"['third', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'W.', 'Somerset', 'Maugham', '1925', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'version', 'released', 'January', '2007', 'story', 'young', 'woman', 'Kitty', 'Fane', 'compellingly', 'played', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'who', 'carefully', 'avoided', 'painful', 'job', 'growing', 'up', 'acting', 'adult.Events', 'conspire', 'move', 'China', 'new', 'husband', 'Dr.', 'Walter', 'Fane', 'played', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'time', 'when', 'China', 'was', 'becoming', 'increasingly', 'involved', 'shift', 'war', 'lords', 'stronger', 'national', 'government', 'shift', 'cholera', 'epidemic', 'husband', 'full', 'attention', 'leaving', 'Kitty', 'fend', 'herself', 'rather', 'badly', 'making', 'fair', 'share', 'mistakes', 'Kitty', 'realize', 'need', 'grow', 'up', 'start', 'looking', 'own', 'needs', 'wants.The', 'scenery', 'striking', 'alien', 'looking', 'filming', 'took', 'place', 'China', 'acting', 'general', 'ambience', 'movie', 'viewers', 'attention', 'impression', 'depth', 'scope', 'story', 'was', 'well', 'crafted', 'made', 'one', 'feel', 'hand', 'master', 'literary', 'craftsman', 'had', 'been', 'involved', 'creation.Sadly', 'are', 'special', 'features', 'disc', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'making', 'movie', 'would', 'deserve', 'lot', 'special', 'attention', 'open', 'many', 'doors', 'interesting', 'background', 'information', 'nothing', 'making', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'serious', 'intense', 'very', 'dramatic', 'only', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'would', 'consider', 'carefully', 'letting', 'be', 'viewed', 'young', 'children']","PAINTED VEIL, THE (WS) (DVD)"

Von Behren ""reneofc""","[5, 7]","In this 2007 film adaptation of the Somerset Maughn novel, lead actors Edward Norton and Naomi Watts render subtle and praiseworthy performances that brings this classic story of an adulterous wife's voyage of self-discovery during the cholera epidemic in 1920's China to a grand panoramic celluloid life akin to the scenic beauty depicted in ""Out of Africa"" complimented with a soaring soundtrack by Alexandre Michel Desplat.  Alluding to the first line of the sonnet by Percy Blythe Shelley:""Lift not the painted veil which those who liveCall Life: though unreal shapes be pictured there,And it but mimic all we would believeWith colours idly spread behind, lurk FearAnd Hope, twin Destinies; who ever weaveTheir shadows, o'er the chasm, sightless and drear,""the film's characters waltz around this theme of perceived images and identities.  Dr. Walter Fane is blinded by his wife's selfishness while Kitty sees her husband only as a functionary intent on his duty.  Only when the two ""lift"" the painted veil of these iconic public personas do they actually see within and glimpse at each other's spirits.For me, any film featuring Edward Norton is worth watching.  As Dr. Walter Fane in this adaptation of the Somerset Maughn novel, ""The Painted Veil,"" again, this superb actor does not disappoint.Some reviewers claim that Norton's performance seems wooden and two-dimensional.  I disagree.  Norton's boyish good looks add to his vulnerability as a husband who has discovered his wife's indiscretion.  The seemingly cardboard sternness he projects shimmers with nuanced frustration, anger and pride; he cannot look at his wife for fear that with one glance she will glimpse the soft underbelly he has hidden beneath his outraged austerity.Similarly, Naomi Watts equally outdoes herself as Kitty, the wayward wife.  With her brunette marcel-styled hair - I have to wonder at this choice of looks for this character---she epitomizes the selfish, emotionally immature woman that wins and breaks Norton's heart.  Kitty's ultimate epiphany occurs gradually.  Watt's perfect porcelain complexion glows like a waxing moon as she untangles herself from her own preoccupation and see the man she married as truly noble and more than worthy of lifetime devotion.The film's one fault may be that once its climatic scene plays out, the ending follows far too quickly, forcing the audience to digest Kitty's reawakened self-awareness in a drive-thru timeframe rather than in the deliberate haute cuisine mode it deserves.Bottom line?  ""The Painted Veil"" offers much to an audience that favors the ""Masterpiece Theatre"" genre of entertainment.  A lush backdrop, notable performances and a classic story succeed in propelling the viewer back in time to the uncertain yet familiar territory explored by the human heart.

Instead of two characters who meet, fall in love, and live happily ever after, Kitty and Walter take a much more difficult journey.Aging playgirl Kitty (Naomi Watts) and nerdy doctor Walter (Edward Norton) marry for all the wrong reasons. Walter's feelings for Kitty are based more on infatuation then on genuine love and respect, and Kitty simply seems to see Walter as a way to escape her family and avoid becoming a spinster. After Kitty has an affair, Walter makes an ultimatum that destroy's Kitty's relationship with her lover, and sends them both to rural China on a mission that is likely to cause one or both of them to die of cholera. The two characters are both so hopelessly disillusioned and depressed at that point that neither seems to care.Strangely, what is meant to be a bitter ending transforms into a hopeful beginning. Isolated and living in miserable conditions, Kitty and Walter are somehow able to find a sense of purpose and a true appreciation for one another.

Way back in 1925 Somerset Maugham wrote a truly forward-thinking feminist story about a vapid woman who comes to realize there's more to life than the empty fun that she's always craved and been led astray by. Ever since, Maugham's ending has been twisted by filmmakers to make it a second-chance-at-love romance. This version even adds a little Chinese political subplot that was entirely absent from the book. So the Chinese background gets modernized, while women are thrown back into love story land in the last reel.  So it goes.But when a movie is this well put together, who cares?  The screenplay--despite my quibble with the direction the end takes--is very sharp.  The scenery is magnificent, and the acting is stellar.  Naomi Watts captures Kitty Fane's vapidity and makes her not just understandable but sympathetic.  Edward Norton is likewise great as her husband Walter, a man who in his anger at being cheated on decides to take them both on a suicide mission to a cholera-plagued area.  The supporting cast is excellent--especially Toby Jones and Diana Rigg.The movie holds up to repeated viewings because the performances are so good, and the mood created by the director is mesmerizing.  Music plays a big part in its success.  The selective use of a piano piece by Satie is enhanced by a score that sounds as if Satie had composed the whole thing.  I actually scrambled to find out whether the waltz featured in the score was Satie's--it wasn't.

Like all remarkable stories, The Painted Veil takes the viewer on a journey; not just from 1920's London to Shanghai and deep into the Chinese interior, but through the human heart.  Through Kitty and Walter Frane, whose relationship will prove as challenging as the cholera epidemic decimating the countryside, we discover the depth and capacity that exist within the human being for change, forgiveness and love.The cinematography is so evoctive that one feels the oppressive humidity of the season on the Chinese plains and hillsides.Ms. Watts classic features and clipped precise Britishness, work perfectly for the thoughtless and vapid Kitty in the early days of the film.  It is only deep into the film, that one senses the true gifts of Ms. Watts as an actor, as with one look or movement she conveys the pain and courage of a woman discovering her true self.His boyish good looks might have hindered believability in playing a man of such complex and contradictory nature, but fortunately, Edward Norton is more than matinee idol good-looks.  Norton is a brilliant and instinctual performer who slips chameleon-like into each new role.  His Walter is the man each and every audience member can understand, because we've each and everyone experienced great joy, great anger, the urge for revenge and ultimately the need to forgive and begin again.

From the first haunting notes of Eric Satie's ""Gnossienne"" to the last plaintive chanson in which we hear the voice of Kitty (Naomi Watts) promising never to forget, the viewer will be mesmerized. Music, in fact, is integral to the story: the Satie piece, which recalls the first encounter of Kitty and Walter (Edward Norton) in an elegant London salon, becomes metaphorical of their troubled marriage as she plunks it out on an out-of-tune upright piano in a rundown convent in China of the 1920s.The beautifully understated performances of Watts and Norton underscore the complexity of Maugham's seemingly simple story. Particularly notable is the poignant performance of Diana Rigg as the elderly Mother Superior whose own marriage to god has become strained by too many years in the unforgiving climate of rural China, ravaged not only by warring factions but also by cholera.The lush silk dresses worn by Watts evoke a bygone era, and the superb cinematography transforms what one suspects is smog into a seemingly painted backdrop of looming mist-enshrouded crags that appear to hover between earth and sky, just as the fates of the characters hover between life and death.",5,Capitivating!,1205712000,"03 17, 2008",2008,1221,"['Painted', 'Veil', 'remarkable', 'movie', 'first', 'haunting', 'notes', 'Eric', 'Satie', 'Gnossienne', 'last', 'plaintive', 'chanson', 'hear', 'voice', 'Kitty', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'promising', 'never', 'forget', 'viewer', 'will', 'be', 'mesmerized', 'Music', 'fact', 'integral', 'story', 'Satie', 'piece', 'first', 'encounter', 'Kitty', 'Walter', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'elegant', 'London', 'salon', 'metaphorical', 'troubled', 'marriage', 'out', 'out-of-tune', 'upright', 'piano', 'rundown', 'convent', 'China', '1920s.The', 'beautifully', 'understated', 'performances', 'Watts', 'Norton', 'complexity', 'Maugham', 'seemingly', 'simple', 'story', 'Particularly', 'notable', 'poignant', 'performance', 'Diana', 'Rigg', 'elderly', 'Mother', 'Superior', 'own', 'marriage', 'god', 'become', 'strained', 'too', 'many', 'years', 'unforgiving', 'climate', 'rural', 'China', 'ravaged', 'not', 'only', 'warring', 'factions', 'also', 'cholera.The', 'lush', 'silk', 'dresses', 'worn', 'Watts', 'evoke', 'bygone', 'era', 'superb', 'cinematography', 'what', 'one', 'smog', 'seemingly', 'painted', 'backdrop', 'looming', 'mist-enshrouded', 'crags', 'appear', 'hover', 'earth', 'sky', 'just', 'fates', 'characters', 'hover', 'life', 'death']","PAINTED VEIL, THE (WS) (DVD)"

John Curran directs his superb cast with fluid movement, allowing the story to unfold in flashbacks in a manner suggestive of the longing and the nightmares of dreams.Bacteriologist physician Dr. Kane (Edward Norton) is devoted to his work, and part of his work is to quickly marry so that he may proceed with his obsession with his career.  In London he is introduced to the reluctant Kitty (Naomi Watts), a lass who continues to look for the perfect love of her life, but is confronted with reality when her father demands she marry. Kitty is not attracted to Dr. Kane but agrees to marry him and soon they are off to China.  While in Shanghai (no, not Hong Kong) Kitty is bored until she meets Charlie Townsend (Liev Schreiber) who, though married and a man of public image, sweeps Kitty off her feet.  Their affair is discovered by Dr. Kane and he insists that Kitty either follow him to a small village in interior China, a town besieged by cholera, or go public with a divorce.  Kitty turns to her lover Charlie who refuses to divorce his society wife and Kitty sadly follows her husband to the sick village.Once settled in the village the couple is befriended by a fellow British gentleman Waddington (Toby Jones) and while Dr. Kane works devotedly with his patients and his epidemiological efforts to stem the cholera, Kitty finds refuge with a group of nuns who care for the children of the dead.  The Mother Superior (Diana Rigg) helps Kitty to adjust and to see the inherent good in her husband, a man who is not only a fine physician but also able to accept the fact that his once disconsolate wife is pregnant, probably as a result of her dalliance with Charlie Townsend.  As the couple begin to accept and appreciate each other the disease strikes home and the story ends with evidence of inner growth in everyone involved.Norton, Watts, Jones, and Rigg are radiant in their understated roles - Norton's English accent is superb.  The beauty of the film is due in a large part to the beauty of the landscapes of China, but also in an equal part to the eloquent cinematography of Stuart Dryburgh and the musical score composed by Alexandre Desplat (with a nod to Satie) and played by pianist Lang Lang.

That seems to be part of the message of The Painted Veil, where egocentrics turn noble in the face of a scourge and British ingenuity gets fresh water back into town.

And if the characters are mostly walking cardboard, some very good actors give them a dash of life, including Naomi Watts as Kitty, Diana Rigg as Mother Superior, and -- especially -- Toby Jones as Waddington.  The on location settings are beautiful, and the film works nicely as a travelogue for journeys to the Chinese interior, assuming that epidemic has stayed quelled.

Gives insight to the day when marriages weren't all about love, sometimes, or at least dont start out that way, in this case.It is a great journey, going from marrying without knowing each other, but having certain expectations from one another. Like behaviors, Walter is someone that is awkard with his affections, not comfortable with the lights on when making love. But Kitty wants passion, and is eager for someone to give that to her.He does finally get to express his passion, as he and Kitty's relationship builds, as they start seeing each other for who they are, the realization  that they love the qualities in each other, as they discover one another's identities.It is such a wonderful thing to visibly SEE the two of them, change the the way they SEE each other, to watch them fall in love.All the parts were well played, and vital to the movie. I loved Waddington, and his part as a friend to the Fane's and love to his companion, who also played well.The actor that played as Kitty's guard was really great, he was so natural.The one that spoke with the warlord, was super, his part was very well written, very clever, and he was perfect, I loved his part.

""The Painted Veil"" is supposed to be a melodramatic realization film, where an infidelitous wife and scorned husband learn love and understanding (i.e. lifting the veil) amidst the harsh, deadly conditions of a cholera epidemic in China.  The problem is, the transformation, while framed adequately amongst suffering, squalor, and isolation is foreign and not believable, and the chemistry between the two (Edward Norton and Naomi Watts) just doesn't exist.  Which isn't to say they acted poorly.  On the contrary, their performances were decent, albeit a bit wooden.  What isn't decent, however, is the script.  Far too much is left hanging or unexplained; the flaws undermine the fine efforts otherwise, and just about everything else is as predictable as getting a wrong order at McDonalds.Watching the film ends up being a lot like having cholera.

1058450,AC31Y35ELBK9V,B000NOIX48,J. Badger,"[1, 1]","The movie, The Painted Veil, is one of those rare instances where the film is more satisfying than the book. Since the book was written by one of our greatest English writers, Somerset Maugham, this is high praise for the film, indeed. Naomi Watts plays Kitty, a spoiled, beautiful English woman who marries a man she does not love, Walter Fane(played by Edward Norton). She has an affair at the first opportunity. Walter finds out and devises a particularly wicked revenge. How his revenge plays out is the main plot of the film.  The book follows a similar story line but the characters of Kitty and Walter are essentially unchanging, and their relationship is basically static as well. In the movie, Kitty, Walter, and their relationship evolve in a surprising, rewarding, and entirely believable manner.

1058451,A2H4AWIOK1REMX,B000NOIX48,"J. C Clark ""eanna""","[10, 16]","The Painted Veil is yet another Edward Norton period drama, complete with a lushness and beauty that no one can create but contemporary film. Wow, does this movie look good. The fields, the haze, the villages, the river, the furniture and mud all reek of the real stuff. It is gorgeous to look at, with a graceful musical score that lovingly enhances the story. Details are great. It looks as good as it could.So where does it not quite measure up? Heart. A film with two cold and self-absorbed main characters needs some potent chemistry to overcome the inherent off-putting-ness of such remote protagonists. And this movie didn't do accomplish that. She is a silly, childish whiner, easily manipulated by a shark who adds another notch to his bedpost. He is cocky and cold, remote and though apparently inflamed with lust, unable to show it. Now, this chilliness is important for the story, as they must grow and overcome the huge obstacles they have built for themselves. But it also makes them harder to care about, making a cerebral, rather than visceral, experience.But the slow pacing and the gradual changes, while all plausible and consistent, somehow just felt too small for so much buildup. There are several good themes explored here: beauty is not a good reason for love; those who claim to want us will say whatever they need to say to get what they want; you can love virtue far more than looks; service and occupation fill a life as amusements cannot. These are all things Kitty realizes that she would never have learned had she remained a 1920s English Valley girl. But it was just too little for the knockout such material could have provided. Worth watching.

THE PAINTED VEIL tells the story of Kitty Fane (Naomi Watts) trapped in a loveless marriage to biologist husband Walter (Edward Norton.) When she has an affair with English Vice Consul Charlie Townsend (Live Shreiber), Walter takes Kitty into the cholera-ridden areas of central China in the hope of curing both the peasants and his marriage.The journey of China becomes a metaphor for the pair's deep retreat within themselves. Their relationship has become a cultivated division; the best they manage to muster toward each other is a courteous contempt. Yet the grim discipline demanded of them by the epidemic, and the daily reminder of life's brevity, forces Kitty and Walter to reflect upon their actions. And so the story becomes for them one of discovering their capacity for forgiveness and love. Death, however, stalks close by.Director Curran manages to coax fine performances from his cast. Watts' Kitty expertly makes the transition from playfulness to gravitas. The sadness in Naomi Watts eyes as she stares upon the cholera stricken children is one of the most memorable scenes. She is one amazing actress and can really express what she feels not only with her dialogue, but with her gestures and facial expressions. Plus continues to be one of the best actors working in Hollywood. Norton's performance is no less masterful. His shy, soulful Walter becomes a wound's scab -- a man so sunk in melancholy and self-loathing as to become dead to himself. Norton's Walter never veers toward self-pity, but manfully ""gets on"" with things, though with the saddest imaginable eyes. There is excellent support from Schreiber as the slick Townsend, Diana Rigg as a nun toiling amid the cholera outbreak, and Toby Jones as Waddington, a British agent who becomes the Fanes' protector. Curran cleverly condenses passages from the novel into simple shots. An entire scene in which Kitty churlishly mocks the homely sacred art of the plague city's convent is quickly captured by a close-up of a rudely carved Madonna figure with a childishly painted face, which tells us all we need to know about the humble nuns' lives versus the world-weary Kitty's. After the speedy initial set up of the film, its lazy pace may put some people off, but this is a beautifully shot and performed film that is well deserving of your time.",4,The Painted Veil is a virtuoso of what a period piece should be,1191715200,"10 7, 2007",2007,2401,"['Unfortunately', 'Never', 'read', 'novel', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'impressive', 'PAINTED', 'VEIL', 'story', 'Kitty', 'Fane', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'trapped', 'loveless', 'marriage', 'biologist', 'husband', 'Walter', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'When', 'affair', 'English', 'Vice', 'Consul', 'Charlie', 'Townsend', 'Live', 'Shreiber', 'Walter', 'Kitty', 'cholera-ridden', 'areas', 'central', 'China', 'hope', 'curing', 'peasants', 'marriage.The', 'journey', 'China', 'metaphor', 'pair', 'deep', 'retreat', 'relationship', 'become', 'cultivated', 'division', 'best', 'manage', 'muster', 'other', 'courteous', 'contempt', 'grim', 'discipline', 'demanded', 'epidemic', 'daily', 'reminder', 'life', 'brevity', 'forces', 'Kitty', 'Walter', 'reflect', 'actions', 'so', 'story', 'one', 'discovering', 'capacity', 'forgiveness', 'love', 'Death', 'however', 'stalks', 'close', 'by.Director', 'Curran', 'manages', 'coax', 'fine', 'performances', 'cast', 'Watts', 'Kitty', 'expertly', 'transition', 'playfulness', 'gravitas', 'sadness', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'eyes', 'cholera', 'stricken', 'children', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'one', 'amazing', 'actress', 'can', 'really', 'express', 'what', 'not', 'only', 'dialogue', 'gestures', 'facial', 'expressions', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'actors', 'working', 'Hollywood', 'Norton', 'performance', 'less', 'masterful', 'shy', 'soulful', 'Walter', 'wound', 'scab', 'man', 'so', 'sunk', 'melancholy', 'self-loathing', 'become', 'dead', 'Norton', 'Walter', 'never', 'self-pity', 'manfully', 'things', 'saddest', 'imaginable', 'eyes', 'excellent', 'support', 'Schreiber', 'slick', 'Townsend', 'Diana', 'Rigg', 'nun', 'toiling', 'cholera', 'outbreak', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'Waddington', 'British', 'agent', 'who', 'Fanes', 'protector', 'Curran', 'cleverly', 'condenses', 'passages', 'novel', 'simple', 'shots', 'entire', 'scene', 'Kitty', 'churlishly', 'homely', 'sacred', 'art', 'plague', 'city', 'convent', 'quickly', 'captured', 'close-up', 'rudely', 'carved', 'Madonna', 'figure', 'childishly', 'painted', 'face', 'need', 'know', 'humble', 'nuns', 'lives', 'world-weary', 'Kitty', 'speedy', 'initial', 'set', 'film', 'lazy', 'pace', 'may', 'put', 'people', 'off', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'performed', 'film', 'well', 'deserving', 'time']","PAINTED VEIL, THE (WS) (DVD)"

Somerset Maugham fan then you may be disappointed because this movie (like many films) veers from some of the finer points of the novel. Having said that, I still found Naomi Watts and Edward Norton's adaptation to be a lovely film. Watts, Norton, and (Naomi's real life mate) Liev Schreiber, all give life to their characters.Norton's character, Dr. Walter Fane,(a bacteriologist and intelligent but introverted man)falls in love with pretty, pampered, and vapid Kitty, while attending a party at her father's invitation. Dr. Fane is only in London a short time and loses no time in proposing marriage. It is the 1920s so Kitty, who is not particularly intelligent but very charming socially, accepts Walter's proposal - since her marriage options are growing slimmer. After a quick honeymoon, the couple settle down in Shanghai where Walter resumes his work. Kitty is soon bored with her new married life and has a careless affair with another man, Charlie (British Consul played by Schreiber). When Walter discovers his wife's infidelity, he's so infuriated, he threatens Kitty with divorce on grounds of adultery - which in this era of time could be social suicide. Walter issues an ultimatum; either Charlie agrees to divorce his wife and marry Kitty, or, Kitty will go with him to the inner regions of China to fight an awful Cholera epidemicCharlie, being the womanizer that he is, wrangles his way out of the picture - declining to divorce his wife and marry Kitty. This is a pivotal point in an awakening of Kitty's self absorption but her character building still has a long way to go! The awkward silence and Walter's disdain of his wife as they travel the backroads to their new destination is painful to watch.They arrive at their new home; a dismal house on the outskirts of the town and find themselves neighbors to another Brit, The Deputy Comissioner, Waddington, who is stationed there (played to perfection by Toby Jones). Waddington loves his indulgences from fine Scotch Whiskey to coupling with his paramour Wan Xi, a very young and beautiful Chinese woman who has followed him to this post. When Kitty and Walter end up at his home late one night, they all become more candid as the liquor flows and Kitty asks Waddington what Wan Xi sees in him. Waddington asks Wan Xi in Chinese and she replies, ""You're a good man."" When he translates this to Kitty we see her struggle with the young woman's answer as she flippantly replies, ""As if a woman has ever loved a man for his virtue."" But this obviously strikes another chord in Kitty's character as we see her begin to look at Walter differently.As she finds herself bored and a little frightened in this new and strange place, Kitty begins volunteering her time at the city orphanage. It is run with efficiency and care by the Mother Superior, played with depth and compassion by Diana Rigg. There's a poignant quote by Rigg's character during a conversation with Kitty about marriage as the Nun speaks candidly of her ""husband"" (God), that will strike the heart of anyone in a long term relationship who also has an appreciation for the spiritual aspects of love itself. There's not as much of Kitty's character development in the movie but we still get an understanding of her desire and attempt to become a better person from the frivolous, and self serving young woman she's been most of her life.Norton does a stellar job in his portrayal of Dr. Walter Fane and as is typical with Norton, his most effective moments are when he's not speaking his lines but in his nuances and mannerisms. He and Watts conjur up a chemistry that is at times mesmerizing. In this film, Walter is more forgiving in the end but it doesn't feel contrived.Anthony Wong Chau Sang commands our attention as Colonel Yu, who at first, shows an obvious dislike for these intruders from the West, but develops a degree of respect and even appreciation, for Dr. Fane's selfless attempts to save Yu's people from the horrendous disease that is ravaging young and old.The movie offers breath taking cinematography, authentic sets, and costumes.

Polhemus ""Book Collector""","[1, 2]","""The Painted Veil"" is one of those films that enchant and insinuate their way into your emotions and haunt and haunt. As there are excellent reviews on this page, I did not plan to write one, but without committing to paper, this movie is not going to leave me.Naomi Watts and Ed Norton are perfectly cast. Is there a story in real life about them? They also co-produced this film based on the novel by the great English writer, Somerset Maugham. Mostly set in China before the Communist Revolution, the story revolves around cholera and its devastating effects on local communities.But Ed's character, Dr. Walter Fane, and Naomi's, Kitty, come by way of England, where he meets her at a party at her parents' house. She has passed that age when a woman should be comfortably ensconced in her own home and family, but Kitty has commitment phobia. A bacteriologist by career, Dr. Fane is home on leave and possibly seeking a wife. Finally, he convinces Kitty to marry him and they move to China.In China, one night they attend a Chinese opera with friends of his and she begins an affair with Liev Shrieber's character not long after.  Walter knows and accepts an assignment in the country which needs medical assistance to fight cholera. That's when everything completely unravels in this emotional turmoil set against the physical turmoil of cholera. He treats her like poison and she retreats into herself, a horrible position for such a social woman.Walter is much too serious and becomes knife-sharp, like his extremely bony body. Now totally socially dependent on her husband, Kitty must reach outside herself if she is to survive. Kitty is invited for tea by the Mother Superior of a nearby orphange. She is a woman of deep wisdom who teaches Kitty how to give of herself, how to really sacrifice and love. Step by step Kitty grows a bit and a bit more, until she volunteers full-time to help the nuns with the children, doing what she knows best, playing piano and teaching songs. During this service she learns the things her husband has been doing, what he is really like, and the depth of character and passion that she has been blind to.When Kitty begins to reach out to Walter and see him for who he is, he begins to blossom out of himself and under her eyes. The little physical actions of these two actors make this movie: how his hardened face softens and glows from within, how her soft, sinuous body moves toward him. It is a joy to behold watching their emotions and their bodies gradually awaken to each other.The cinematography shows a lush China, a lush relationship between the government official across the way and his Chinese concubine. Other parallels: the sacrifice of the nuns and Kitty's sacrifice for her husband, emotional turmoil and physical turmoil. The revolt against marriage through adultery with the upcoming Chinese revolt. The ways of a good writer are relentless and show in this beautifully rendered film.Love and redemption, grace and forgiveness, sincerity and sacrifice--all fine things in the hands of skilled writers and movie makers.

Dr. and Mrs. Walter Fane, having lived in Shanghai for two years, are traveling to a remote area of the country because of a cholera epidemic, despite the fact that Walter Fane (Edward Norton) is a bacteriologist, not a physician. He and Kitty Fane (Naomi Watts) have lived in China since they were first married.The trip to the cholera-infested village is a far cry from that of their arrival, as there is a palpable tension between them. It seems that Kitty was unfaithful to him with the Vice Consul of Shanghai, Charlie Townsend (Liev Schrieber). When Walter tells her of the epidemic he has volunteered to help with, she informs him that is no place for a woman, and refuses to go... until he tells her if she does not, he will file for divorce, which would be a heavy blow to her social position.The Painted Veil, based on the novel by W. Somerset Maugham, explores the relationship between Walter and Kitty against the backdrop of the epidemic. I've covered the story in more depth in my review of the book. When I saw there was a film, I was curious to know how well it was adapted to the screen.The story has been fleshed out somewhat, of necessity, as the novel is in Kitty's POV, which does not tell us as much as we'd like of Walter and his mindset. I think the screenwriter bridged the gap rather well, and Edward Norton brings him to life, endearing him to me in a way the novel never did.Naomi Watts plays Kitty well. She begins the film as a shallow, empty-headed woman whose sole goal in life is to be married, not for love but because it's the thing to do. She justifies her affair to herself because she doesn't love Walter, and she believes herself in love with Charlie. Well, Walter helps her to see Charlie for what he really is. Her journey is one of self-discovery. At the beginning, Walter loves her very much and she barely sees him, but over the course of the film, she comes to realize his true worth, as well as her own, as they find one another.Can love make everything right? Unfortunately, some things are beyond its ability to heal, and the film has a bittersweet ending.It is a well-done adaptation of the novel, and even though it romanticizes their relationship at the end, I think I prefer the changes, which make a potentially depressing film into a sad one. It may not be action-packed--Maugham's stories seldom are--but it possesses a definite depth of character. Look for Toby Jones (Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy) as Waddington, the Englishman that becomes Kitty's confidante in a strange land.The cinematography is beautiful, and so is the music that is used in the soundtrack.I highly recommend this film if you enjoy such films as The English Patient.",5,Romantic and haunting story of self-discovery,1393113600,"02 23, 2014",2014,2727,"['time', '1925', 'place', 'China', 'Dr.', 'Mrs.', 'Walter', 'Fane', 'having', 'lived', 'Shanghai', 'two', 'years', 'are', 'traveling', 'remote', 'area', 'country', 'cholera', 'epidemic', 'fact', 'Walter', 'Fane', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'bacteriologist', 'not', 'physician', 'Kitty', 'Fane', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'have', 'lived', 'China', 'were', 'first', 'married.The', 'trip', 'cholera-infested', 'village', 'far', 'cry', 'arrival', 'palpable', 'tension', 'Kitty', 'was', 'unfaithful', 'Vice', 'Consul', 'Shanghai', 'Charlie', 'Townsend', 'Liev', 'Schrieber', 'When', 'Walter', 'epidemic', 'volunteered', 'help', 'place', 'woman', 'go', 'not', 'will', 'file', 'divorce', 'would', 'be', 'heavy', 'blow', 'social', 'position.The', 'Painted', 'Veil', 'based', 'novel', 'W.', 'Somerset', 'Maugham', 'relationship', 'Walter', 'Kitty', 'backdrop', 'epidemic', ""'ve"", 'covered', 'story', 'more', 'depth', 'review', 'book', 'When', 'saw', 'was', 'film', 'was', 'curious', 'know', 'how', 'well', 'was', 'adapted', 'screen.The', 'story', 'been', 'fleshed', 'out', 'somewhat', 'necessity', 'novel', 'Kitty', 'POV', 'not', 'tell', 'as', 'much', ""'d"", 'like', 'Walter', 'mindset', 'think', 'screenwriter', 'bridged', 'gap', 'rather', 'well', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'life', 'endearing', 'way', 'novel', 'never', 'Watts', 'Kitty', 'well', 'film', 'shallow', 'empty-headed', 'woman', 'sole', 'goal', 'life', 'be', 'married', 'not', 'love', 'thing', 'do', 'affair', 'herself', ""n't"", 'love', 'Walter', 'love', 'Charlie', 'Well', 'Walter', 'see', 'Charlie', 'what', 'really', 'journey', 'one', 'self-discovery', 'beginning', 'Walter', 'very', 'much', 'barely', 'course', 'film', 'realize', 'true', 'worth', 'as', 'well', 'own', 'find', 'one', 'another.Can', 'love', 'make', 'everything', 'right', 'Unfortunately', 'things', 'are', 'ability', 'heal', 'film', 'bittersweet', 'ending.It', 'well-done', 'adaptation', 'novel', 'even', 'relationship', 'end', 'think', 'prefer', 'changes', 'make', 'potentially', 'depressing', 'film', 'sad', 'one', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'action-packed', 'Maugham', 'stories', 'seldom', 'are', 'definite', 'depth', 'character', 'Look', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'Tinker', 'Tailor', 'Soldier', 'Spy', 'Waddington', 'Englishman', 'Kitty', 'confidante', 'strange', 'land.The', 'cinematography', 'beautiful', 'so', 'music', 'used', 'soundtrack.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'enjoy', 'such', 'films', 'English', 'Patient']","PAINTED VEIL, THE (WS) (DVD)"

1058479,AYPS4RCXEFSJP,B000NOIX48,K. Boullosa,"[21, 27]","This well-made film based on the eponymous novel by W. Somerset Maugham was co-produced by its two stars, Edward Norton and Naomi Watts, who obviously were deeply committed to their roles and to the film.  The story is set in 1925.  Norton plays Dr. Walter Fane, a bacteriologist who falls in love with Kitty, played by Watts, an upper-middle-class Englishwoman whose parents are pressuring her to marry as she is getting older.  Although Kitty is not remotely in love with Fane, she agrees to marry him to get away from her mother's nagging, and follows him to Shanghai, where he works in a government laboratory.  Fane, at the beginning of the film, is a somewhat stolid, repressed figure (he insists on turning out the light when they make love) whose passions, until he meets Kitty, have all been focused on his work.  Their marriage more or less stumbles forward, with neither finding the emotional honesty or courage to try to initiate change.  Then Kitty meets Charlie Townsend (Liev Schreiber), a bon vivant, married man-about-town in Shanghai.  Townsend seduces Kitty, and they begin an affair that Dr. Fane discovers.  Fane confronts his wife, and offers her a choice: a disgraceful divorce, with Townsend named as the guilty co-respondent, or Kitty can follow him to a cholera-ridden village in-country, where, as a bacteriologist and a doctor, he will try to bring the epidemic under control.  When Kitty realizes that even with a divorce, Townsend will never leave his wife and marry her, she agrees to follow her husband into the epidemic - much to his satisfaction, as he intends the hardships of the journey and life in-country to punish her.  However, in the weeks that follow, amid heat, humidity, privation, and death, the couple begin to see each other in a different light, through their mutual experiences amid the stricken village: his at the hospital and hers at the orphanage attached to the hospital.  Confronted with horrific realities, the couple's boundaries begin to break down and they begin to communicate more honestly.The performances are fine, with Norton, particularly, doing his usual understated and unselfish work, Watts believable as the initially petulant Kitty (although not so believable as a borderline ""old-maid""), and Schreiber suitably shallow as the suave seducer.  The cinematography is beautiful.  The film has some very affecting moments.Yet something about the film is less than the sum of its parts, and the fault lies in the script.  Issues are left hanging and neither explored nor revealed through character development.  Fane is already in love with Kitty as the film opens, yet she does not even know his name.  No history is given - he and she appear, he is a stranger to her, yet he is already in love with her.  The initial stages of their courtship are hurried through, and therefore provide no foundation for their later choices - for example, why Fane refuses to inoculate himself against cholera when they reach the epidemic.  The mutual spiteful ""suicide pact"" that one is asked to accept without that foundation simply doesn't hold up.The film, thus, has a ""paint by numbers"" quality that allows the viewer to guess the next turns of the plot with unerring accuracy, even if they have not read Maugham's novel.  The film does not so much unfold as ""unwrap"", with all the compartments already clearly labeled as they come out of the box.  One knows, for example, before it happens, that Townsend has no intention of  marrying Kitty.  The viewer can see it coming as Fane offers to divorce Kitty by taking the blame himself, as a ""gentleman"" used to do such circumstances, only if Townsend promises to leave his wife and marry Kitty afterward.  Kitty is the only one shocked at the revelation that Townsend has merely been amusing himself - the viewer has known it all along, and a sense of impatience sets in as we wait for the ""real"" part of the story to begin.And this quality has deprived the movie, despite its many other assets, of the tension that is a prerequisite for a memorable film.""The Painted Veil"" is certainly worth seeing once, especially for the earnest and sincere performances of the cast.

The central and most interesting aspect of this film, in my opinion, is the evolution and development of the character Kitty (Naomi Watts).Kitty, a spoiled and selfish rich girl, marries the socially awkward research physician, Dr. Walter Fane (Norton) just to spite her meddlesome parents.  She has little regard for the good doctor, even though he is madly in love with her, and she spites him by having an affair with the philandering Charlie Townsend.  Dr. Fane turns out to be not as niave and timorous as she believes, and when he sternly confronts her, she chooses to follow him into the cholera-ridden interior of China rather than face an ignominious divorce.  While there, she must endure boredom and the flinty indifference of her spouse, until she finds meaning and purpose serving in the village orphanage.  In the process of time, she learns to appreciate her husband, and develops a true and selfless emotional bond with him.  In the end, we see a mature, self-possessed young women, having both self-respect as well as devotion to family.The music is also lovely.

Maybe that's mean spirited of me, but then again the film seems to recognize the problems of its raison d'etre on more than one occasion.  Kitty Fane (Naomi Watts) comes home all thrilled by the good charitable work Diana Rigg and the other nuns are doing, but Walter (Ed Norton) sets her straight with a grim, they're stealing babies to turn them into Catholics.  You can see that Kitty doesn't think that such a bad idea after all.  Then there's the pre-teen Chinese orphan who refuses to answer to her Western name.  Good for her!  And what about that Chinese attache general or whatever he was, could they have picked someone who looks less Asian?  Love to see an Eastern telling of THE PAINTED VEIL, I guess the Ron Howard movie of a few years back, GUNG HO, would be the nearest equivalent.But whatever qualms I have about the movie, Watts and Norton are fantastic, and in Norton's marvelous nude scene there's one trick I never thought I'd see captured on film.  He's waking up having made love to his wife after many years of treating her coldly, and he's trying to sneak out of her bedroom without waking her, and we see him retreating away from the camera and then Watts speaks, startling him to such a degree we see him freeze and yet his buttocks quiver, delicately, magnificently.  Was this CGI or just more of that Oscar worthy Norton total command of the body?  Whatever it is, he should do it in every movie and perhaps on one of those old fashioned whistle-stop trains that used to bring politicans to every city in the nation, and he could step out on a bunting-lined caboose at every stop and show the folks what fine acting is really all about.",5,"Now, what was the painted veil in the movie?",1212278400,"06 1, 2008",2008,2135,"['Watched', 'one', 'impressed', 'superior', 'acting', 'two', 'stars', 'really', 'hard', 'imagine', 'why', 'decided', 'make', 'particular', 'story', 'so', 'old', 'fashioned', 'have', 'ask', 'are', 'supposed', 'admire', 'British', 'people', 'position', 'China', 'anomalous', 'just', 'plain', 'wrong', 'found', 'cheering', 'when', 'Chinese', 'youths', 'decided', 'menace', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'knocked', 'howdah', 'crowded', 'alleys', 'town', 'mean', 'spirited', 'then', 'again', 'film', 'recognize', 'problems', 'raison', ""d'etre"", 'more', 'one', 'occasion', 'Kitty', 'Fane', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'home', 'thrilled', 'good', 'charitable', 'work', 'Diana', 'Rigg', 'other', 'nuns', 'are', 'doing', 'Walter', 'Ed', 'Norton', 'straight', 'grim', ""'re"", 'stealing', 'babies', 'turn', 'Catholics', 'can', 'see', 'Kitty', ""n't"", 'think', 'bad', 'idea', 'Then', 'pre-teen', 'Chinese', 'orphan', 'who', 'answer', 'Western', 'name', 'Good', 'what', 'Chinese', 'attache', 'general', 'whatever', 'was', 'could', 'have', 'picked', 'someone', 'who', 'less', 'Asian', 'Love', 'see', 'Eastern', 'telling', 'THE', 'PAINTED', 'VEIL', 'guess', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'movie', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'GUNG', 'HO', 'would', 'be', 'nearest', 'equivalent.But', 'qualms', 'have', 'movie', 'Watts', 'Norton', 'are', 'fantastic', 'Norton', 'marvelous', 'nude', 'scene', 'one', 'trick', 'never', 'thought', ""'d"", 'see', 'captured', 'film', 'waking', 'up', 'having', 'made', 'love', 'wife', 'many', 'years', 'treating', 'coldly', 'trying', 'sneak', 'bedroom', 'waking', 'see', 'retreating', 'away', 'camera', 'then', 'Watts', 'speaks', 'startling', 'degree', 'see', 'freeze', 'yet', 'buttocks', 'quiver', 'delicately', 'magnificently', 'Was', 'CGI', 'just', 'more', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'Norton', 'total', 'command', 'body', 'should', 'do', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'one', 'old', 'fashioned', 'whistle-stop', 'trains', 'used', 'bring', 'politicans', 'city', 'nation', 'could', 'step', 'out', 'bunting-lined', 'caboose', 'stop', 'show', 'folks', 'what', 'fine', 'acting', 'really']","PAINTED VEIL, THE (WS) (DVD)"

Bernabo,"[57, 60]","Lift not the painted veil which those who liveCall Life: though unreal shapes be pictured there,And it but mimic all we would believeWith colours idly spread,--behind, lurk FearAnd Hope, twin Destinies; who ever weaveTheir shadows, o'er the chasm, sightless and drear.""The Painted Veil"" is old school, not just because it is based on W. Somerset Maugham's 1925 novel, but also because this 2006 movie has sensibilities more akin to the Hollywood of the 1930s (when the movie was first filmed with Greta Garbo and Herbert Marshall), than of today.  There was a story in the news this week about a controversial and racy billboard in Chicago that proclaimed ""Life's short. Get a divorce.""  The billboard was taken down after a week, over the objections of the two divorce attorneys who put it up, but there is no denying that divorces have become a lot more popular since Maugham's day (the high water marked was 1980 in the U.S. when the divorce rate topped out at 41%).  I bring this up because ""The Painted Veil"" is about two people who do not get divorced, and not because they are staying together for the sake of the children, because there are not any children.  It is a love story, but one of the most unromantic ones that I have ever seen, which is, rather surprisingly, not a bad thing.Kitty Garstin (Naomi Watts) is the daughter of an unambitious solicitor whose inflated idea of herself has seen her reject all possible suitors.  But when her younger sister marries and her mother (Maggie Steed) asks pointedly how long she intends to live off of her father, the confluence of events compels her to accept the marriage proposal of Walter Fane (Edward Norton), a young bacteriologist who is heading off to China.  This is hardly the foundation for a marriage and in Hong Kong the bored Kitty ends up having an affair with Charlie Townsend (Liev Schreiber).  When Walter discovers the affair he agrees to let Kitty divorce him if Townsend will divorce his wife and agree to marry Kitty.  When Townsend refuses Kitty is stunned, and with nowhere else to go she follows Walter as he volunteers to deal with a cholera epidemic in the interior of China.  It is there that the husband and wife find themselves changing.The title of ""The Painted Veil"" is taken from a sonnet by Percy Bysshe Shelley, the opening sestet of which is quoted above, and I find it insightful that Maugham's characters do not take the poet's advice.  Almost of as much interest as what is happening between Walter and Kitty is the way he comes to understand that all of his scientific and medical knowledge is of no value if he cannot persuade the locals how to deal with the epidemic.  This is a minor part of the story, and it is the omnipresent threat of cholera that is of more importance to the way things work out in ""The Painted Veil,"" but still a nice little critique of the arrogance of Europeans in dealing with the Third World in the screenplay by Ron Nyswaner (""Philadelphia"").Director John Curran (""We Don't Live Here Anymore"") was able to film the entire movie in China, but the beautiful vistas shot by Stuart Dryburgh (""The Piano"") serve as the setting for the story and never overwhelm it the way that usually happens in a David Lean epic.  The performances by the main characters, including Toby Jones as Waddington and Diana Rigg as the Mother Superior, are uniformly understated in keeping with the cultured reserve of their characters, and that may well explain why my appreciation for the moment of mutual redemption for Kitty and Walter is more intellectual than emotional.  Of course, back in the day this story was probably as much of a stiff-upper lip tearjerker as you were going to find in literature.Final Note: The only extra you will find on this DVD is a trailer for the movie, but unless I have gone completely insane this is a different trailer than the one I saw on other DVDs that inspired me to check out this movie.  This one gives away specific details regarding the characters and plots that I do not remember seeing in that other trailer, which is why I was able to get into this movie with no expectations beyond that indicated by the presence of Norton, Watts and company that this film was going to take the high road (Update: I found that other trailer on another DVD and, indeed, it gives away very little of the story, which is much more effective than the one accompanying the actual movie).",4,Watts and Norton shine in a classy retelling of Maugham's novel,1178755200,"05 10, 2007",2007,4418,"['Lift', 'not', 'painted', 'veil', 'who', 'liveCall', 'Life', 'unreal', 'shapes', 'be', 'pictured', 'there', 'mimic', 'would', 'believeWith', 'colours', 'idly', 'spread', 'lurk', 'FearAnd', 'Hope', 'twin', 'Destinies', 'who', 'ever', 'weaveTheir', 'shadows', ""o'er"", 'chasm', 'sightless', 'drear', 'Painted', 'Veil', 'old', 'school', 'not', 'just', 'based', 'W.', 'Somerset', 'Maugham', '1925', 'novel', 'also', '2006', 'movie', 'sensibilities', 'more', 'akin', 'Hollywood', '1930s', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'first', 'filmed', 'Greta', 'Garbo', 'Herbert', 'Marshall', 'today', 'was', 'story', 'news', 'week', 'controversial', 'racy', 'billboard', 'Chicago', 'proclaimed', 'Life', 'short', 'Get', 'divorce', 'billboard', 'was', 'taken', 'down', 'week', 'objections', 'two', 'divorce', 'attorneys', 'who', 'put', 'up', 'denying', 'divorces', 'have', 'become', 'lot', 'more', 'popular', 'Maugham', 'day', 'high', 'water', 'marked', 'was', '1980', 'U.S.', 'when', 'divorce', 'rate', 'topped', 'out', '41', '%', 'bring', 'up', 'Painted', 'Veil', 'about', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'divorced', 'not', 'are', 'staying', 'together', 'sake', 'children', 'are', 'not', 'children', 'love', 'story', 'one', 'most', 'unromantic', 'ones', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'rather', 'surprisingly', 'not', 'bad', 'thing.Kitty', 'Garstin', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'daughter', 'unambitious', 'solicitor', 'inflated', 'idea', 'seen', 'reject', 'possible', 'suitors', 'when', 'younger', 'sister', 'marries', 'mother', 'Maggie', 'Steed', 'pointedly', 'how', 'long', 'live', 'off', 'father', 'confluence', 'events', 'compels', 'accept', 'marriage', 'proposal', 'Walter', 'Fane', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'young', 'bacteriologist', 'who', 'heading', 'off', 'China', 'hardly', 'foundation', 'marriage', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'bored', 'Kitty', 'up', 'having', 'affair', 'Charlie', 'Townsend', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'When', 'Walter', 'affair', 'let', 'Kitty', 'divorce', 'Townsend', 'will', 'divorce', 'wife', 'agree', 'marry', 'Kitty', 'When', 'Townsend', 'Kitty', 'stunned', 'nowhere', 'else', 'go', 'Walter', 'deal', 'cholera', 'epidemic', 'interior', 'China', 'there', 'husband', 'wife', 'find', 'changing.The', 'title', 'Painted', 'Veil', 'taken', 'sonnet', 'Percy', 'Bysshe', 'Shelley', 'opening', 'sestet', 'quoted', 'find', 'insightful', 'Maugham', 'characters', 'do', 'not', 'take', 'poet', 'advice', 'Almost', 'as', 'much', 'interest', 'what', 'happening', 'Walter', 'Kitty', 'way', 'understand', 'scientific', 'medical', 'knowledge', 'value', 'can', 'not', 'persuade', 'locals', 'how', 'deal', 'epidemic', 'minor', 'part', 'story', 'omnipresent', 'threat', 'cholera', 'more', 'importance', 'way', 'things', 'work', 'out', 'Painted', 'Veil', 'still', 'nice', 'little', 'critique', 'arrogance', 'Europeans', 'dealing', 'Third', 'World', 'screenplay', 'Ron', 'Nyswaner', 'Philadelphia', '.Director', 'John', 'Curran', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Live', 'Here', 'Anymore', 'was', 'able', 'film', 'entire', 'movie', 'China', 'beautiful', 'vistas', 'shot', 'Stuart', 'Dryburgh', 'Piano', 'serve', 'setting', 'story', 'never', 'overwhelm', 'way', 'usually', 'David', 'Lean', 'epic', 'performances', 'main', 'characters', 'including', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'Waddington', 'Diana', 'Rigg', 'Mother', 'Superior', 'are', 'uniformly', 'understated', 'keeping', 'cultured', 'reserve', 'characters', 'may', 'well', 'explain', 'why', 'appreciation', 'moment', 'mutual', 'redemption', 'Kitty', 'Walter', 'more', 'intellectual', 'emotional', 'course', 'back', 'day', 'story', 'was', 'probably', 'as', 'much', 'stiff-upper', 'lip', 'tearjerker', 'were', 'going', 'find', 'literature.Final', 'Note', 'only', 'extra', 'will', 'find', 'DVD', 'trailer', 'movie', 'have', 'gone', 'completely', 'insane', 'different', 'trailer', 'one', 'saw', 'other', 'DVDs', 'inspired', 'check', 'out', 'movie', 'one', 'away', 'specific', 'details', 'regarding', 'characters', 'plots', 'do', 'not', 'remember', 'seeing', 'other', 'trailer', 'why', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'movie', 'expectations', 'indicated', 'presence', 'Norton', 'Watts', 'company', 'film', 'was', 'going', 'take', 'high', 'road', 'Update', 'found', 'other', 'trailer', 'DVD', 'indeed', 'away', 'very', 'little', 'story', 'much', 'more', 'effective', 'one', 'accompanying', 'actual', 'movie']","PAINTED VEIL, THE (WS) (DVD)"

1058501,A12OTDIWIG841L,B000NOIX48,Leslie Thompson,"[7, 9]","Beautiful setting, especially the reflections of mountains in the river, the exotic countryside. It appeared so serene despite the disease and death of the human population. The haunting and sad score by Desplat, including Erik Satie's ""Gnossienne No. 1."", intensified the depression and loneliness of the main characters, which was as stifling as the humidity. A gorgeous yet tragic atmosphere...You kind of get used to all the adultery in movies/tv these days, and as usual I felt that the guilty party should be punished by the wronged spouse. However, I felt sorry for Naomi Watts' character, Kitty, especially when she figured out that her lover was not as invested in their relationship as she was. I wasn't too surprised about that though. She must have been so angry with herself, felt so foolish, humiliated. And I found myself becoming frustrated with Edward Norton's character, Dr. Fane, as he was too engrossed in his work to notice Kitty - but he didn't talk very much to her even before her affair. He kept his distance. But my feelings towards him changed by the end of the movie.I hate saying this, because I hate how marriage is a sign of ""normality"" in our society, that there must be something wrong with you if you're 30 and not married and/or don't even want to get married (at least where I live), but marriage to Dr. Fane was the best choice for Kitty, although she was very independent, a feminist, in her opinions - at one time she said, ""Why should a woman have to marry someone she doesn't love just to be married"" (or something like that). But she learned to love what she had, and spent less time agonizing over the love she didn't have. Her main character flaw, selfishness, eventually disintegrated as she became involved with the orphans, doing something ""useful"" with her life. It was neat to watch her character totally be transformed, especially her interactions with her husband.I really liked Toby Jones' character, although he is the stereotypical plain-looking man in a relationship with a beautiful woman. And the woman loves him because of his virtue, not outward appearance. It's nice, and I believe it, but I often think of how it's rarely the other way around - how often do you see a gorgeous man with a plain woman? Seriously, if you can think of such a couple, celebrity or not, please leave a comment!But anyway, a very enjoyable movie, very moving and thought-provoking.

1058504,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B000NOIX48,Linda Linguvic,"[3, 3]","This 2006 film is the third movie adaptation of the 1925 novel by Somerset Maugham.  The film brings us back to that time and place where Brits were considered the good guys when they moved to China and tried to help the people.  It brought me right there too, being carried in a sedan chair, feeling the heat and the dust and the basic ""foreignness"" of China for the British characters.Naomi Watts is cast in the role of a spoiled upper-class young woman who is pressured into marrying Edward Norton, a do-gooder British bacteriologist who lives in Shanghai and is looking for a bride.  He plays the role as a well-meaning, but uptight and stuffy man without an ounce of romantic appeal.  Not surprisingly, his bride is soon having an affair with Liev Schreiber, a businessman and diplomat married to a very socially prominent woman.  When Norton finds out about the affair, he is furious, and, as Liev Schreiber has no intention of leaving his wife, Watts is forced to go with her husband to the interior of China where there is a raging Cholera epidemic.Against the backdrop of this serious disease which is ravaging the countryside, this marriage is displayed with all its faults.  Watts hates her husband who is doing his best to help the people who don't understand why he denies them their water supply or why he insists that the dead must be buried immediately.  Norton works day and night to help the people, even creating an irrigation system and making peace with the local warlord.  Watts starts to work in an orphanage run by nuns and she begins to soften towards her husband.  Eventually, they fall in love and there seems to be happiness in spite of all the disease around them as well as lots of anti-British feelings.  Then tragedy strikes.I loved this film. I thought the acting was outstanding.  I felt the reality of the China that Somerset Maugham described in 1925.  And I really related to the story.  This film did not get very good reviews when it came out.  It was thought to be too old fashioned for a modern audience.

Not incidentally, the music of &#34;Veil&#34;  is absolutely wonderful, enhancing the story's imagery of every scene, doubling the force of its emotional intensity and intimacy.  Production design is sensitive, often using moving veils, &#34;noir&#34; lighting techniques where less becomes more thus allowing viewer to use his/her own imagination to live into the scene.  But the telling power of this film is it's ability to appear shallow with the Walter's sullen resentment of the family's &#34;dirty little secret&#34;, while heroically plunging into his life's work which also plummets the depth of his love.....(see Corinthians I)  What I particularly loved was how the director kept me from knowing who was the protagonist, i.e., who must be transformed by the story's experience? until the last part of the film.  Entertains, holds you, pacey in spots while slowing in other parts to allow viewer time to absorb/experience the moment.

1058510,AN94YI3URSAII,B000NOIX48,Lostgirl,"[17, 18]","I wasn't sure what I was expecting when I came to this film: a standard period drama perhaps. I'd heard mixed reviews, a lackluster trailer, and it was overlooked by the awards bodies in 2006, but I was pleasantly surprised in the quality of the film and the performances in particular.Nothing about this film is fast or surprising really. We know essentially who our characters are in the first 5 minutes, Walter meets Kitty at a party and asks her to dance. The next day he proposes and she accepts. We know he proposes because he is a rational, intelligent man, used to organization and reason. He falls in love with Kitty suddenly and without reason, but the only way he knows how to respond is to act on it. He's a doctor going to Shanghai to study a cholera epidemic and he loves her- the reasonable thing to do is to marry her and take her with him. She accepts his proposal to get as far away from her mother as humanly possible.  The pair are obviously mismatched. Kitty likes Walter well enough but she's a fun loving girl, slightly shallow, fond of gossip, games, dancing and theater. He's an intellectual who is socially awkward. It's not surprising that Kitty has a fling with another Englishman in Shanghai. Walter finds out and is naturally devistated. He offers Kitty a respectable, quiet divorce only if her lover agrees to marry her. He doesn't. As a sort of punishment for her adultery Walter volunteers to serve as a doctor for a small inland village ravaged by cholera. Kitty is to come with him. What is intended as a punishment turns out to be their salvation.All we need to know about the nature of the characters is established in the first 45 minutes of the film. We're told little but shown everything. With a smile Kitty shows us she's not always genuine, she enjoys a party but has a two faced side to her. In handing a gift to Kitty, Walter shows us his awkwardness, his kindness, and his fear of the woman he loves. As soon as he says he's an epidemiologist we know he's passionate about is work. Naomi Watts and Edward Norton subtly convey every emotion of their characters by their tone of voice, the ways they stand in one anothers presence. Neither has a meldramatic scene or a grand declaration but they exhibit the heights of human emotions.Ultimately the actions of other characters, and imperialism itself are viewed through the lens of each character. Kitty sees nuns taking care of the children in an orphanage and says how wonderful they are. Walter says, that yes, the children benefit but Kitty should also keep in mind that the nuns are not totally altrustic: they pay the families of children to give them their babies so they can raise them as Catholics. The children are cared for and protected but also denied their culture. The film itself presents these concerns but doesn't pass judgement. That is left up to the viewer.Also particuilarly worthy of note are the settings, the stunning backgrounds of China's mountains and rivers. The lush greenery is shot with somewhat muted tones. Alexandre Desplat's score compliments the muted visuals of the film. It's subdued and evocative with occasional Asian influences sprinkled throughout.The Painted Veil is one of those films where more than one aspect is well above average and that elevates the film as a while. This isn't a Merchant-Ivory film but it could pass for one: the beautiful visuals, excellent performances, amd strong score recall literary adaptations such as Howard's End or A Room With A View.",5,A Beautiful Film,1179014400,"05 13, 2007",2007,3507,"['was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'when', 'came', 'film', 'standard', 'period', 'drama', 'perhaps', ""'d"", 'heard', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'lackluster', 'trailer', 'was', 'overlooked', 'awards', 'bodies', '2006', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'quality', 'film', 'performances', 'particular.Nothing', 'film', 'fast', 'surprising', 'really', 'know', 'essentially', 'who', 'characters', 'are', 'first', '5', 'minutes', 'Walter', 'Kitty', 'party', 'dance', 'next', 'day', 'know', 'rational', 'intelligent', 'man', 'used', 'organization', 'reason', 'love', 'Kitty', 'suddenly', 'reason', 'only', 'way', 'how', 'respond', 'act', 'doctor', 'going', 'Shanghai', 'study', 'cholera', 'epidemic', 'her-', 'reasonable', 'thing', 'do', 'marry', 'take', 'proposal', 'get', 'far', 'away', 'mother', 'humanly', 'possible', 'pair', 'are', 'obviously', 'mismatched', 'Kitty', 'Walter', 'well', 'enough', 'fun', 'loving', 'girl', 'slightly', 'shallow', 'fond', 'gossip', 'games', 'dancing', 'theater', 'intellectual', 'who', 'socially', 'awkward', 'not', 'surprising', 'Kitty', 'fling', 'Englishman', 'Shanghai', 'Walter', 'out', 'naturally', 'devistated', 'Kitty', 'respectable', 'quiet', 'divorce', 'only', 'lover', 'marry', ""n't"", 'sort', 'punishment', 'adultery', 'Walter', 'volunteers', 'serve', 'doctor', 'small', 'inland', 'village', 'ravaged', 'cholera', 'Kitty', 'come', 'What', 'intended', 'punishment', 'out', 'be', 'salvation.All', 'need', 'know', 'nature', 'characters', 'established', 'first', '45', 'minutes', 'film', ""'re"", 'told', 'little', 'shown', 'everything', 'smile', 'Kitty', 'not', 'always', 'genuine', 'party', 'two', 'faced', 'side', 'handing', 'gift', 'Kitty', 'Walter', 'awkwardness', 'kindness', 'fear', 'woman', 'As', 'soon', 'epidemiologist', 'know', 'passionate', 'about', 'work', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'subtly', 'emotion', 'characters', 'tone', 'voice', 'ways', 'stand', 'one', 'anothers', 'presence', 'meldramatic', 'scene', 'grand', 'declaration', 'exhibit', 'heights', 'human', 'emotions.Ultimately', 'actions', 'other', 'characters', 'imperialism', 'are', 'viewed', 'lens', 'character', 'Kitty', 'nuns', 'taking', 'care', 'children', 'orphanage', 'how', 'wonderful', 'are', 'Walter', 'yes', 'children', 'benefit', 'Kitty', 'should', 'also', 'keep', 'mind', 'nuns', 'are', 'not', 'totally', 'altrustic', 'pay', 'families', 'children', 'give', 'babies', 'can', 'raise', 'Catholics', 'children', 'are', 'cared', 'protected', 'also', 'denied', 'culture', 'film', 'concerns', ""n't"", 'pass', 'judgement', 'left', 'up', 'viewer.Also', 'particuilarly', 'worthy', 'note', 'are', 'settings', 'stunning', 'backgrounds', 'China', 'mountains', 'rivers', 'lush', 'greenery', 'shot', 'somewhat', 'muted', 'tones', 'Alexandre', 'Desplat', 'score', 'muted', 'visuals', 'film', 'subdued', 'evocative', 'occasional', 'Asian', 'influences', 'sprinkled', 'throughout.The', 'Painted', 'Veil', 'one', 'films', 'where', 'more', 'one', 'aspect', 'well', 'above', 'average', 'film', 'while', ""n't"", 'Merchant-Ivory', 'film', 'could', 'pass', 'one', 'beautiful', 'visuals', 'excellent', 'performances', 'amd', 'strong', 'score', 'recall', 'literary', 'adaptations', 'such', 'Howard', 'End', 'Room', 'View']","PAINTED VEIL, THE (WS) (DVD)"

While in China, we see both Watts and Norton grow individually and together into what becomes quite the unexpected romantic and self-sacrificing drama.My opinion: The acting is diverse and pulls on many relatable emotional strings, despite being set in the 1920s.

He applies to go into succor of a backwater village harassed by cholera epidemic and drags Kitty with him into a nearly suicide mission.Subject to extreme conditions, poverty, political and cultural pressures and loneliness, the couple starts to alchemize their relationship.The film chronicles these events delivering a gripping and endearing human story.Main actress and actors in the film perform greatly.Naomi Watts, as Kitty, gives a performance full of subtleties, showing the evolution of a spoiled and bored woman into a compromised and compassionate Samaritan.Edward Norton, as Dr. Fane, is able to express and transmit the inner turmoil of an obsessive scientist confronted with unexpected marital issues. This was a great year for Norton who has delivered another great performance as the main male character of ""The Illusionist"".Toby Jones, as Waddington, a stranded British neighbor gives a very good acting piece.Nevertheless these are not the only high points of the film; adaptation of Somerset Maugham's novel done by Ron Nyswaner is paramount; musical score from French composer Alexandre Desplat subtly underline different scenes and finally cinematography in charge of Englishman Stuart Dryburgh is excellent.This picture is tasty dish for movie fans.

1058535,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000NOIX48,mirasreviews,"[24, 28]","Based on M. Somerset Maugham's novel of the same name, ""The Painted Veil"" explores a young couple's desperation and self-loathing that lead to self-discovery amid the lovely countryside and civil unrest of 1925 China. Kitty (Naomi Watts) was a London party girl who couldn't settle on a husband, much to her parents' chagrin. Family pressures and the opportunity to one-up her sister finally convinced Kitty to accept the proposal of a rather serious, bookish, and smitten bacteriologist Walter Fane (Edward Norton). Not her type. But they are shortly off to Shanghai, China, where Walter manages a government laboratory. Petulant, bored, and accustomed to being indulged, Kitty has an affair with conspicuously charming Vice Consul Charlie Townsend (Liev Schreiber). In anger, Walter insists that his wife accompany him to the interior of China, where he has volunteered to work at a hospital that is being deluged by the worst cholera epidemic in years.Something is lacking in the attraction between these two characters, even as the emotional distance between them lessens. But what Walter and Kitty lack in chemistry, they make up for in gripping mutual and self-hatred. They do more than tempt fate to punish them; they compete to be the most brazenly self-destructive. The credit is mostly due Edward Norton, who imbues Walter's self-loathing with the calculated ferocity of a normally careful man who is deeply wounded. Kitty's desperate boredom and isolation in the countryside force her gaze inward. The chaotic, threatening eruption of disease and anti-foreign sentiment push the couple together. ""The Painted Veil"" has a anti-colonial air which might be misleading given Chiang Kai-Shek's  distaste for striking workers and his complex relationship with the Treaty Ports. But Walter's efforts to help peasant populations in spite of themselves comments on the double-edged sword of third world intervention. The intriguing milieu bolsters the film's inconsistently compelling emotions to create a successful character drama.The DVD (Warner Brothers 2007): The only bonus feature is a theatrical trailer (2 min).

1058542,A2PJSHMB83QYKX,B000NOIX48,MoVwatcher20,"[2, 2]","*This is my first review, so please forgive its imperfections*I came across this film when scrolling through my video library on a rainy afternoon, and let me just say, if I judged a book strictly by its cover, I would have passed this without a second glance and forgotten it completely. Not that the DVD cover isn't stunning, depicting some enchanting Chinese scenery, but the image of a couple snuggling on a rowboat, I have to admit, had me sighing a little. I remember thinking, Oh God, this is going to be the Chinese version of Australia, a film that shoves some competent cinematography and landscape shots down your throat to distract from an eye-rollingly corny love story.Again, if I was sold on appearences alone, I would have left this film in the dirt, but being a woman and having my weaknesses, I decided to try it out with the knowledge that Edward Norton (known for being choosy when taking roles) was the lead. I was prepared for a hackneyed romance told mainly through montages (one of my personal pet peeves) and some overdramatic music. I will say, the film DOES open in a somewhat typical fashion. Boy meets girl, boy falls for girl, boy marries girl, but ahhh, girl doesn't fall for boy. However, the film at this point veers dramatically from where one would expect a movie with said scenerio to head. The wife of Edward Norton's character, played in a wonderful turn by Naomi Watts, is vein, selfish, and unfaithful, but portrayed so as not to make her hateful to the audience. For some actors, this is easier than for others, and Watts shines in creating a beautifully rounded character that transforms from a spoiled daughter of high society to a devoted and powerful wife and woman. I'm going into as much detail as I am because the character development is one of the many great aspects of this film. Each character is written with as much virtue as flaw. No one is perfect, yet no one is unlikeable. Edward Norton is mesmerizing as he has been in every film I have ever seen him in. I truly believe this is one of his most powerful, and sadly underrated, performances. He pulls off a flawless accent and powerfully communicates the resentment he feels for his philandering wife, but what makes the perfomance memorable is how internal most of it is. Norton's eyes play as great a role as his mouth, for there is not a scene in this movie where his tortured betrayal is not evident. He and Watts play off each other with ease, which is ironic because a great chunk of this film has them at each others' throats. The movie boasts an outstanding supporting cast, including Liev Schreiber as the seductive albeit underlyingly slimy lover, Toby Jones (who I have never seen in a role this pivitol since) as the couple's neighbor and sort-of conscience, and the fabulous Diana Rigg as the Mother Superior of the French convent. A lot of times in movies, the nun character is employed to offer sentimental words of wisdom, which Rigg does here, but her perfomance keeps the character from being cliche and she easily wins the best line of the film with her speech to Watts' character about faith and how it prevails with the help of love.As much as I'm raving about the performances, I don't want this film to come across as one only watchable for its actors, because as I discovered within the first ten minutes of this nearly two hour picture, it has so much more to offer. Based on the 1925 novel by W. Somerset Maugham (which I understand takes a far less romantic turn in its finale than the film version), The Painted Veil tells the story of a shy, young bacteriologist named Walter Fane (Norton), who has returned from his work in China in hopes of taking a wife. He instantly falls for the beautiful but spoiled Kitty (Watts), and abruptly asks her for her hand in marriage. Accepting his proposal(for far less romantic reasons), Kitty is immediately disappointed in Walters' mundane lifestyle and his apparent lack of passion, and wastes no time in seeking it out elsewhere, namely the charming(and married) Charlie Townsend (Schreiber). The lovers are seperated, however, by Walter's discovery, who, as punishment for her behavior, drags Kitty along with him to a small Chinese Village (the name of which is escaping me at the moment) infested with a mammoth outbreak of Cholera. Walter volunteers to be the town's doctor, with the self-pitying Kitty confined to the solitude of their isolated home, her only company the being the non-english-speaking Chinese house-maid and their neighbor, Mr.Waddington, whom she comes to befriend. Walter, his fondness for Kitty now replaced with bitter distain, seeks refuge in his work, but runs into obstacles with the townspeople condemning him as a white imperialist good for nothing but corrupting their tradition. As the film progresses, it is the obstacles faced by the two individuals that bring them to a new understanding of themselves and their realizing that they are both at fault for the marriage's failure through both wanting the other to be something they aren't. The relationship between Walter and Kitty is both complex and beautiful. It undergoes several beatings, but ultimately prevails as one more powerful and romantic than I was prepared for. The love story avoids cliche by taking its time to really manifest itself, and by that I mean it truly had me on the edge of my seat in anticipation for the two characters to finally give in to their feelings. It is something special, as we watch two people, who become more than just characters but emalgums of both human frailty and strength, discover their ability to love. The third act of the film I will not elaborate on because I want everyone to experience it on their own, as well as the rest of a film that has criminally flown under the radar for far too long.As one who compulsively studies film-making and the factors that determine its greatness, I will wrap up this review by complimenting the stunning production design of the movie. Every shot is strategically framed, pulling no distracting camera cuts like one might see in one of Scorsese's lesser films. And although this film, for me, earns the right to boast some unbelievable shots of the Chinese countryside, at no time does it rely on them to force a reaction. The word to describe this film, in its design atleast, is subtlety. The director, the cinematographer and the production designer let the film speak for itself in how wonderous it is, and Alexandre Desplat lets his score serve as a backdrop rather than a mood-setter. This film is a rare pleasure, and all I can say is I wish there were more out there with as much poise and tenderness as this one possesses. This is a film worth setting time aside to watch, because it is one that demands full attention in order for the viewer to full appreciate what it is trying to do, which is not to wack them over the head with its sentimentality, but rather cradle them with its quiet and tender beauty.",5,A true originial,1339891200,"06 17, 2012",2012,6970,"['*This', 'first', 'review', 'please', 'forgive',

Walter (Ed Norton) is a young attractive doctor who specializes in the scientific study of infectious disease.  He is very mild mannered, reserved - not much of a talker.  He meets Kitty at a social function and is smitten. Kitty could take him or leave him - to her, one fellow is very much like another - basically she just wants to dance and go to plays.Walter has volunteered to go to China and doesn't have time to woo Kitty, he asks her to marry him anyways knowing full well she is not smitten with him. In fact, she hardly knows him.Kitty is given a rude awakening by her mother when she asks how long Kitty expects her father to continue supporting her. (Basically, we've raised you now get out.) Plus she overhears her mother on the phone talking about plans for her sisters wedding and saying no, she has no such expectations for Kitty the disappointing daughter...  So, in response to her mother's comments Kitty weds Walter and moves to China with him.Kitty meets Charlie (an acquaintance of her husbands) and they end up having an affair (which is basically boring).  Walter discovers it and gives her an ultimatum - (A) he files for divorce charging her with adultery and naming Charlie as her lover or (B) she accompanies him to a remote area in China where there is a bad cholera outbreak and he is desperately needed (and their lives would be at risk from the disease)  She runs to Charlie and does not get the response she desired and so agrees to go to the cholera area instead of facing the scandal.For 3/5ths of the movie, Kitty is not someone you feel any sympathy for really... and Walter isn't much better.  But finally in remote China, the struggle of being an unwanted westerner in China and the fight against cholera (and boredom for Kitty) Kitty is forced to grow up, become a better person, a useful person, and the two of them begin to grow close. They come to see each other in a new light and finally find real love.There is some beautiful landscape footage when they are in remote China. The actress who plays the head of the French convent is wonderful, and their odd neighbor in remote China is also very good in his role. Both likable characters that help enrich the story, but after the first 3/5ths of the movie have gone.  I think a different actress might have been a better Kitty... Ed Norton did well with the somewhat dull role of Walter.All in all, I guess it was an okay movie (I would imagine the book is much better) - I don't think you'll find this will enrich your life for the watching, but it was ok. My personal recommendation on this is to pass. There are many other entertaining and enriching movies out there.",3,Its okay,1344643200,"08 11, 2012",2012,2784,"['Kitty', 'played', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'relatively', 'attractive', 'somewhat', 'spoiled', 'girl', 'pretty', 'much', 'nothing', 'offer', 'Walter', 'Ed', 'Norton', 'young', 'attractive', 'doctor', 'who', 'scientific', 'study', 'infectious', 'disease', 'very', 'mild', 'mannered', 'reserved', 'not', 'much', 'talker', 'Kitty', 'social', 'function', 'smitten', 'Kitty', 'could', 'take', 'leave', 'one', 'fellow', 'very', 'much', 'basically', 'just', 'dance', 'go', 'plays.Walter', 'volunteered', 'go', 'China', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'woo', 'Kitty', 'marry', 'anyways', 'knowing', 'full', 'well', 'not', 'smitten', 'fact', 'hardly', 'him.Kitty', 'given', 'rude', 'awakening', 'mother', 'when', 'how', 'long', 'Kitty', 'father', 'continue', 'supporting', 'Basically', ""'ve"", 'raised', 'now', 'get', 'out', 'mother', 'phone', 'talking', 'plans', 'sisters', 'wedding', 'saying', 'such', 'expectations', 'Kitty', 'disappointing', 'daughter', 'So', 'response', 'mother', 'comments', 'Kitty', 'weds', 'Walter', 'moves', 'China', 'him.Kitty', 'meets', 'Charlie', 'acquaintance', 'husbands', 'end', 'up', 'having', 'affair', 'basically', 'boring', 'Walter', 'discovers', 'ultimatum', 'divorce', 'charging', 'adultery', 'naming', 'Charlie', 'lover', 'B', 'remote', 'area', 'China', 'where', 'bad', 'cholera', 'outbreak', 'desperately', 'needed', 'lives', 'would', 'be', 'risk', 'disease', 'Charlie', 'not', 'get', 'response', 'desired', 'so', 'go', 'cholera', 'area', 'instead', 'facing', 'scandal.For', '3/5ths', 'movie', 'Kitty', 'not', 'someone', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'really', 'Walter', ""n't"", 'much', 'better', 'finally', 'remote', 'China', 'struggle', 'being', 'unwanted', 'westerner', 'China', 'fight', 'cholera', 'boredom', 'Kitty', 'Kitty', 'forced', 'grow', 'up', 'become', 'better', 'person', 'useful', 'person', 'two', 'begin', 'grow', 'close', 'come', 'see', 'other', 'new', 'light', 'finally', 'find', 'real', 'love.There', 'beautiful', 'landscape', 'footage', 'when', 'are', 'remote', 'China', 'actress', 'who', 'head', 'French', 'convent', 'wonderful', 'odd', 'neighbor', 'remote', 'China', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'role', 'likable', 'characters', 'help', 'enrich', 'story', 'first', '3/5ths', 'movie', 'have', 'gone', 'think', 'different', 'actress', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Kitty', 'Ed', 'Norton', 'did', 'well', 'somewhat', 'dull', 'role', 'Walter.All', 'guess', 'was', 'okay', 'movie', 'would', 'imagine', 'book', 'much', 'better', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'find', 'will', 'enrich', 'life', 'watching', 'was', 'ok.', 'My', 'personal', 'recommendation', 'pass', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'entertaining', 'enriching', 'movies', 'there']","PAINTED VEIL, THE (WS) (DVD)"

1058552,A1129LM24YWSZV,B000NOIX48,"Nicole Bradshaw ""Nicole Bradshaw""","[0, 0]","This amazing film is based on the Somerset Maugham novel of the same name. (And, being based on Maugham, you know this ain't gonna end well, right?) Set in the 1920s, The Painted Veil tells the story of Kitty (Watts), a beautiful young woman who, as our story begins, is yet unmarried. Just as Kitty is feeling increasing pressure from her family to wed, Walter Fane (Norton) walks into her life. Fane is a brilliant, quiet bacteriologist who is currently working in Shanghai. Fane is quickly infatuated with Kitty, and he promptly asks her to marry him. Kitty agrees (due to a variety of reasons), and the two are wed and travel to China together.Once in China, however, the couple's differences sharpen. Kitty finds comfort in the arms of a lover, and when Walter discovers her transgression, he confronts her. Walter's terms are simple: 1.) He can divorce her publicly for adultery, ruining her reputation; 2.) She can join him in a small Chinese village where he has agreed to serve as a doctor. (The village is battling an awful cholera epidemic.)Kitty finds herself traveling to the Chinese countryside with her husband. The stench of adultery hangs palpably between them, and the two seem to despise each other. However, over time, Kitty and Walter begin to rediscover themselves and each other, leading to a conclusion that is redemptive and (in some ways) affirmative of the capacity of the human spirit.This is an amazing, character-driven film. Performances by Watts and Norton, which make up the bulk of the screen-time, are unbelievable. Kitty is initially rendered as a slightly shallow woman who really doesn't know herself. She has not concerned herself with anything that is not about her. She chooses to marry Walter because she wants to get away from her mother and because she's beginnig to feel it necessary to marry SOMEONE to satisfy her family. However, as the film continues, Kitty grows up. She begins to think of the world outside of herself. She begins to yearn for a useful life.Walter, a serious scientist, is not a social person. But he sees Kitty and is drawn to her. His need to be back in China is pressing, so he rushes an awkward courtship and proposes. There is much more to Walter, however, than Norton initially lets us see. His intelligence, his astute conclusions about human nature, his capacity for vengeance, his capacity for forgiveness. There are no flat characters here. These are intriguing, real, flawed people, and they are fascinating to watch.Panoramic shots of the varied landscape of China are beautifully done, and the costumes are wonderful. The real show, though, is the evolving relationship between Kitty and Walter.Soooooo worth seeing. A beautiful film to watch, and a performer's tour de force.",5,"Artful, character-driven, and lovely",1210377600,"05 10, 2008",2008,2756,"['amazing', 'film', 'based', 'Somerset', 'Maugham', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'being', 'based', 'Maugham', 'know', 'ai', ""n't"", 'gon', 'end', 'well', 'right', 'Set', '1920s', 'Painted', 'Veil', 'story', 'Kitty', 'Watts', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'story', 'begins', 'yet', 'unmarried', 'Just', 'Kitty', 'feeling', 'increasing', 'pressure', 'family', 'wed', 'Walter', 'Fane', 'Norton', 'life', 'Fane', 'brilliant', 'quiet', 'bacteriologist', 'who', 'currently', 'working', 'Shanghai', 'Fane', 'quickly', 'infatuated', 'Kitty', 'promptly', 'marry', 'Kitty', 'due', 'variety', 'reasons', 'two', 'are', 'wed', 'travel', 'China', 'together.Once', 'China', 'however', 'couple', 'differences', 'sharpen', 'Kitty', 'comfort', 'arms', 'lover', 'when', 'Walter', 'transgression', 'Walter', 'terms', 'are', 'simple', '1', 'can', 'divorce', 'publicly', 'adultery', 'ruining', 'reputation', '2', 'can', 'join', 'small', 'Chinese', 'village', 'where', 'agreed', 'serve', 'doctor', 'village', 'battling', 'awful', 'cholera', 'epidemic', 'Kitty', 'traveling', 'Chinese', 'countryside', 'husband', 'stench', 'adultery', 'hangs', 'palpably', 'two', 'seem', 'despise', 'other', 'However', 'time', 'Kitty', 'Walter', 'begin', 'rediscover', 'other', 'leading', 'conclusion', 'redemptive', 'ways', 'affirmative', 'capacity', 'human', 'spirit.This', 'amazing', 'character-driven', 'film', 'Performances', 'Watts', 'Norton', 'make', 'up', 'bulk', 'screen-time', 'are', 'unbelievable', 'Kitty', 'initially', 'rendered', 'slightly', 'shallow', 'woman', 'who', 'really', ""n't"", 'know', 'not', 'concerned', 'anything', 'not', 'marry', 'Walter', 'get', 'away', 'mother', 'beginnig', 'feel', 'necessary', 'marry', 'SOMEONE', 'satisfy', 'family', 'However', 'film', 'Kitty', 'up', 'think', 'world', 'herself', 'yearn', 'useful', 'life.Walter', 'serious', 'scientist', 'not', 'social', 'person', 'Kitty', 'drawn', 'need', 'be', 'back', 'China', 'pressing', 'awkward', 'courtship', 'much', 'more', 'Walter', 'however', 'Norton', 'initially', 'see', 'intelligence', 'astute', 'conclusions', 'human', 'nature', 'capacity', 'vengeance', 'capacity', 'forgiveness', 'are', 'flat', 'characters', 'here', 'are', 'intriguing', 'real', 'flawed', 'people', 'are', 'fascinating', 'watch.Panoramic', 'shots', 'varied', 'landscape', 'China', 'are', 'beautifully', 'done', 'costumes', 'are', 'wonderful', 'real', 'show', 'evolving', 'relationship', 'Kitty', 'Walter.Soooooo', 'seeing', 'beautiful', 'film', 'watch', 'performer', 'tour', 'de', 'force']","PAINTED VEIL, THE (WS) (DVD)"

It was so good, so wonderful.  Edward Norton and Naomi Watts were spectacular!  What took me so long to watch and totally enjoy?  I was INSTANTLY immersed in this movie.The scenery is breath-taking, the plot great. Set in the 1920's, Watts and Norton, marry -- she to please her parents and to basically get out of their house.  Norton is taken with Watts and is in love with her.  But, ALAS!  He doesn't know how to show his love and he is too deeply involved in his work in the medical field to realize he is shutting his wife out.  She gets involved in an affair with one of their friends.Norton finds out, and to me, it seemed out of resentment, he takes a job in China to help fight a cholera epidemic.  Wow, how nasty and awful this place is.  While Norton is loving being there, having the medical time of his life, Watts HATES it there.  To make matters worse, Norton is full of resentment and punishes Watts by ignoring her and being mean and nasty.  Watts seems to be slowly going out of her mind, being in a foreign place, full of disease, political uprisings, dangerous situations!We are taken through this village fighting cholera and the marriage and relationship of Norton and Watts.  Diana Rigg as Mother Superior was wonderful, she is a superb actress.The movie is a tear-jerker but well worth every kleenex.  The ending is sad and leaves a lesson learned -- don't waste time playing games with those you love.I HIGHLY recommend this movie, although I am probably one of the last people in the world to just have seen it.

Not just the main characters but all the minor ones give stellar performances -- from the scornful Chinese officer who barely tolerate the imperial westerners in his country to Waddington, the dissipated but dedicated counsul, to the luminous Mother Superior and her charming nuns.  Even bit characters, such as the nameless servant who runs to fetch Waddington when Kitty can't deal with her packing up Walter's things, or the Manchu lover of Waddington turn in memorable performances.Kitty and Walter are perfect in their portrayal of the bloodless husband concealing deep passions, and the shallow girl who married for escape and ultimately finds love.  Particularly memorable is how the movie portrays the fine line that can exist between love and hatred.While the movie is slow, and a little predictable, the time that the book was written in demands this kind of slowness, and it lends the movie even more poignancy. Those who don't like classic literature or need a lot of action in their entertainment probably won't like this movie, but for those of us who like classic literature and historical movies the deliberate building up of the pace adds rather than detracts from the movie.  Particularly moving is the A la Clare Fontaine sequence, as Kitty leaves China.I would have liked some extras on the DVD, but I suppose we can't have everything.I seem drawn to this movie whenever I see it is on the schedule, (and it seems to be showing up on pay movie channels quite a bit).

They immediately leave London, scarcely knowing one another.Kitty, who is rather shallow and likes games, has little in common with the quiet, cerebral Walter, who is work-obsessed.  She naively believes her new lover, the British Consul (Lev Schreiber) will leave HIS wife for her.  Of course he won't and of course Walter discovers the affair.In retribution, Walter drags Kitty overland to a cholera epidemic zone, where he struggles to help the suffering locals while making Kitty suffer for her adulteries.Both characters discover new inner strengths and gradually learn to tolerate, respect, and even forgive each other, as the disease cuts a swathe through the local population.Magnificent cinematography, authentic Mandarin dialogue and accent, and a great screenplay augment Norton's finest acting job to date.  Support from Toby Jones and Diana Rigg is extraordinary.  Curran directs the Somerset Maugham novel well.This film is beautiful, gripping, subtle, and worth multiple watchings--so don't hesitate to buy and add to your collection, cinephile or not.(Reviewer's chops:  Mandarin speaker, former resident of China, personally met Norton's father several times in SW China).",5,Sublime Forgiveness,1205366400,"03 13, 2008",2008,1341,"['Shanghai', '1925', 'Kitty', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'just', 'rashly', 'married', 'soft-spoken', 'bacteriologist', 'Walter', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'escape', 'domineering', 'mother', 'immediately', 'leave', 'London', 'scarcely', 'knowing', 'one', 'another.Kitty', 'who', 'rather', 'shallow', 'likes', 'games', 'little', 'common', 'quiet', 'cerebral', 'Walter', 'who', 'work-obsessed', 'naively', 'new', 'lover', 'British', 'Consul', 'Lev', 'Schreiber', 'will', 'leave', 'HIS', 'wife', 'course', 'wo', ""n't"", 'course', 'Walter', 'affair.In', 'retribution', 'Walter', 'Kitty', 'overland', 'cholera', 'epidemic', 'zone', 'where', 'help', 'suffering', 'locals', 'making', 'Kitty', 'suffer', 'adulteries.Both', 'characters', 'discover', 'new', 'inner', 'strengths', 'gradually', 'learn', 'tolerate', 'respect', 'even', 'forgive', 'other', 'disease', 'swathe', 'local', 'population.Magnificent', 'cinematography', 'authentic', 'Mandarin', 'dialogue', 'accent', 'great', 'screenplay', 'augment', 'Norton', 'finest', 'acting', 'job', 'date', 'Support', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'Diana', 'Rigg', 'extraordinary', 'Curran', 'Somerset', 'Maugham', 'novel', 'well.This', 'film', 'beautiful', 'gripping', 'subtle', 'worth', 'multiple', 'watchings', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'buy', 'add', 'collection', 'cinephile', 'not', 'Reviewer', 'chops', 'Mandarin', 'speaker', 'former', 'resident', 'China', 'personally', 'met', 'Norton', 'father', 'several', 'times', 'SW', 'China']","PAINTED VEIL, THE (WS) (DVD)"

If you want lots of noise, speed and sensation, rush down to your  local Cineplex where you'll find lots of trash that will satisfy your taste.We see how the main characters are thrown together by circumstances and how their decisions shape their lives.  I didn't read the novel so I can't comment on how well the film adapts it but I found it to be very complete and satisfying, which is not always the case when a screenwriter has to cram hundreds of pages into into a two hour script.You can tell that this was a labor of love for Ed Norton, whose performance as the repressed doctor is perfect.  His character is awkward and shy, more at home in a laboratory than at a party.  He is hardly attractive and so is powerfully attracted to his opposite--a beautiful, careless socialite who has nothing on her mind other than disliking her dreadful mother. Her mother forces her marry, or be cut off from support, so having no other option in sight,  she accepts the proposal of this hapless doctor.A recipe for disaster! They go to China, where she is temporarily distracted, by another expatriot, a charming, married fellow, who possesses all the excitement that her poor husband lacks and they soon fall into something like love.  When her husband discovers her affair he forces her to accompany him  to rural China, where cholera is ravaging the population.  Wow!  If she thought life back in London was a bummer, this brings misery to a whole new level!Besides cholera, there is political unrest, so danger presents itself on all sides.  She and her husband soon detest each other and she tries to contact her ex-lover to rescue her.  Alas! she learns that she was only one of a string of dalliances that this cad had indulged in.I won't divulge the rest of the story.

1058576,A23I6PFD9X6Y5D,B000NOIX48,Raymond K. Wong,"[9, 10]","W. Somerset Maugham's 1925 novel had been made into films twice before actor-producer Edward Norton attempted it one more time. What they've made is a scrumptious, passionate film for the thinking crowd.Kitty (Watts) is a bored socialite in London who has a romantic notion about marriage. Walter Fane (Norton) is a serious biologist who has been secretly in love with Kitty for years. Before Walter sets sail to Shanghai for a research post, he proposes to Kitty, who promptly laughs him off, because she simply doesn't love him. When Kitty's younger sister announces her wedding plans, out of embarrassment and the desire to move away from her parents, Kitty hastily accepts Walter's proposal.In Shanghai, the Fanes lead rather separate lives. Walter immerses himself in work and neglects his bored wife. Meanwhile, Kitty falls for married diplomat Charlie Townsend (Schreiber). When Walter finds out about the affair, he gives Kitty an ultimatum: either go with him to a small village in the middle of a cholera epidemic, or face the scandal of a divorce on grounds of infidelity. Kitty has no choice but follow her husband.Once at the village, Walter devotes all his time to his work, trying to find ways to contain the disease. His contempt for his wife is evident. Kitty befriends a former British commissioner, Waddington (Jones), a hedonistic man who serves as her only link to the world she once knew. Eventually, Walter and Kitty get to know each other better, and grow to care about each other while facing the horrific epidemic and the turbulent political climate in China.Naomi Watts (King Kong) is completely believable as the complex Kitty, and she goes through a wide range of emotions and growth with conviction. In the beginning, she's naive, selfish, and confused. By the end she's mature and responsible and loving. The transformation is natural and she does a fine job letting us see deep into her character's soul. Edward Norton (The Illusionist) has the opposite challenge. His character starts off as being serious, arrogant, and dispassionate. We can empathize with Kitty's straying, given how little in common they have. By the end, Norton has given us a warm and great, altruistic man, and we can see how Kitty would fall deeply in love with him by then.The supporting cast is superb. Toby Jones (Infamous) plays Waddington with humor, warmth, and earnestness. We form certain prejudices against his character, but his portrayal ultimately leaves us with the impression that he's a good guy. Dianna Rigg (Heidi) is delightful as Mother Superior of a convent in the village, offering comfort and wisdom to both Kitty and the audiences. And Hong Kong star Anthony Wong has an affecting turn as Colonel Yu, whose skepticism of the ""foreigners"" turns into genuine admiration.Writer Ron Nyswaner (Philadelphia) has done a good job adapting the novel. He expands the cultural, social, and political elements of the story while keeping the focus on the relationship between the two leads. The historical backdrop and the cultural aspects of the story are fascinating. What transpires is a rich, multilayered character-driven story that feels real and relevant. The dialogue is sparse but insightful, the relationships between these characters are complex and flawed, and the themes and subtexts are moving.Director John Curran (They Don't Live Here Anymore) has a grand vision for this film. The sets, the costumes, the production designs are spot on. The Painted Veil is also one of the few recent American films actually shot on location in China, and that gives the film a marvelous realism. Stuart Dryburgh's (The Beautiful Country) cinematography is gorgeous -- a definite feast for the eye. And Alexandre Desplat's (The Queen) scrumptious score complements the film perfectly, giving it a romantic yet despondent feel.With its delicate production, stellar performances, deft direction, a smart script, and a poignant ending, The Painted Veil harks back to the golden days of Hollywood. It is one of these rare, old-fashioned romantic dramas that delight the senses and nurture the hearts and minds.(Full review at [..])",4,Scrumptious and Moving,1178668800,"05 9, 2007",2007,4145,"['W.', 'Somerset', 'Maugham', '1925', 'novel', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'films', 'twice', 'actor-producer', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'attempted', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'What', ""'ve"", 'made', 'scrumptious', 'passionate', 'film', 'thinking', 'crowd.Kitty', 'Watts', 'bored', 'socialite', 'London', 'who', 'romantic', 'notion', 'marriage', 'Walter', 'Fane', 'Norton', 'serious', 'biologist', 'who', 'been', 'secretly', 'love', 'Kitty', 'years', 'Walter', 'sets', 'sail', 'Shanghai', 'research', 'post', 'Kitty', 'who', 'promptly', 'off', 'simply', ""n't"", 'love', 'When', 'Kitty', 'younger', 'sister', 'wedding', 'plans', 'embarrassment', 'desire', 'move', 'away', 'parents', 'Kitty', 'hastily', 'Walter', 'proposal.In', 'Shanghai', 'Fanes', 'lead', 'rather', 'separate', 'lives', 'Walter', 'work', 'bored', 'wife', 'Meanwhile', 'Kitty', 'married', 'diplomat', 'Charlie', 'Townsend', 'Schreiber', 'When', 'Walter', 'out', 'affair', 'Kitty', 'ultimatum', 'go', 'small', 'village', 'middle', 'cholera', 'epidemic', 'face', 'scandal', 'divorce', 'grounds', 'infidelity', 'Kitty', 'choice', 'follow', 'husband.Once', 'village', 'Walter', 'time', 'work', 'trying', 'find', 'ways', 'contain', 'disease', 'contempt', 'wife', 'evident', 'Kitty', 'former', 'British', 'commissioner', 'Waddington', 'Jones', 'hedonistic', 'man', 'who', 'only', 'link', 'world', 'once', 'knew', 'Eventually', 'Walter', 'Kitty', 'get', 'know', 'other', 'better', 'grow', 'care', 'other', 'facing', 'horrific', 'epidemic', 'turbulent', 'political', 'climate', 'China.Naomi', 'Watts', 'King', 'Kong', 'completely', 'believable', 'complex', 'Kitty', 'wide', 'range', 'emotions', 'growth', 'conviction', 'beginning', 'naive', 'selfish', 'confused', 'end', 'mature', 'responsible', 'loving', 'transformation', 'natural', 'fine', 'job', 'letting', 'see', 'deep', 'character', 'soul', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'Illusionist', 'opposite', 'challenge', 'character', 'off', 'being', 'serious', 'arrogant', 'dispassionate', 'can', 'empathize', 'Kitty', 'straying', 'given', 'how', 'little', 'common', 'have', 'end', 'Norton', 'given', 'warm', 'great', 'altruistic', 'man', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'Kitty', 'would', 'fall', 'deeply', 'love', 'then.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'superb', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'Infamous', 'Waddington', 'humor', 'warmth', 'earnestness', 'form', 'certain', 'prejudices', 'character', 'portrayal', 'ultimately', 'impression', 'good', 'guy', 'Dianna', 'Rigg', 'Heidi', 'delightful', 'Mother', 'Superior', 'convent', 'village', 'offering', 'comfort', 'wisdom', 'Kitty', 'audiences', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'star', 'Anthony', 'Wong', 'affecting', 'turn', 'Colonel', 'Yu', 'skepticism', 'foreigners', 'genuine', 'admiration.Writer', 'Ron', 'Nyswaner', 'Philadelphia', 'done', 'good', 'job', 'adapting', 'novel', 'cultural', 'social', 'political', 'elements', 'story', 'keeping', 'focus', 'relationship', 'two', 'leads', 'historical', 'backdrop', 'cultural', 'aspects', 'story', 'are', 'fascinating', 'What', 'rich', 'multilayered', 'character-driven', 'story', 'feels', 'real', 'relevant', 'dialogue', 'sparse', 'insightful', 'relationships', 'characters', 'are', 'complex', 'flawed', 'themes', 'subtexts', 'are', 'moving.Director', 'John', 'Curran', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Live', 'Here', 'Anymore', 'grand', 'vision', 'film', 'sets', 'costumes', 'production', 'designs', 'are', 'spot', 'Painted', 'Veil', 'also', 'one', 'few', 'recent', 'American', 'films', 'actually', 'shot', 'location', 'China', 'film', 'marvelous', 'realism', 'Stuart', 'Dryburgh', 'Beautiful', 'Country', 'cinematography', 'gorgeous', 'definite', 'feast', 'eye', 'Alexandre', 'Desplat', 'Queen', 'scrumptious', 'score', 'complements', 'film', 'perfectly', 'giving', 'romantic', 'yet', 'despondent', 'feel.With', 'delicate', 'production', 'stellar', 'performances', 'deft', 'direction', 'smart', 'script', 'poignant', 'ending', 'Painted', 'Veil', 'back', 'golden', 'days', 'Hollywood', 'one', 'rare', 'old-fashioned', 'romantic', 'dramas', 'delight', 'senses', 'nurture', 'hearts', 'minds', 'Full', 'review', '[', '..', ']']","PAINTED VEIL, THE (WS) (DVD)"

This film is about a bacteriologist (Edward Norton) who very quickly falls in love with a young lady (Naomi Watts), they marry, and he takes her back to China where he's stationed as a English civil servant.  She doesn't really love him when they marry and tells him that, but she looks at marrying him as a way to get out of her home and away from her mother since there aren't any other prospects for her.  In China she gets bored with him and her life there and winds up having an affair with a low level English diplomat.  I won't say any more but suffice it to say that this movie just slowly sucks you in -- the art direction, the photography, the styling -- you feel as if you're in China in the 1930's.  The acting is superb, in my opinion, because it is not-in-your-face.  Rather, it is subtle and there are moments when a glance, or smirk, or a move of the head evokes the feeling vs. words.  Naomi Watts seems perfect for the part of the wife, and Edward Norton plays the repressed, formal English man to perfection.  The supporting cast - especially Toby Jones, are also superb.  Too bad that this movie didn't garner more attention when it came out because it certainly deserves a viewing.  It's a different kind of love story with no violence, no naked bodies, no CGI graphics, no swearing, no car/motorcycle/truck action shots -- that explains why it probably didn't make $300 billion dollars at the box office.

Somerset Maugham's novel, which is a good thing since only a phantom of his novel can be pinpointed.  Kitty's search for spiritual and personal development has been shoved to the side and replaced by her need to be loved. The enigmatic Walter Fane is here converted to a romantic hero and far more vocal/expressive than he was ever meant to be on the page. I just don't understand why the characters needed to be altered so dramatically in order to tell the tale, no matter how distorted.Notable in many reviews of this film, was the fact many critics found the characters unlikeable. Well, yes, but they were also far more likeable and less transformative than how they were portrayed in the film.  Romantizing the plot to the degree where it became all about love and - to secure the Chinese seal of approval required to allow filming - distorting Walter's role in the containment of the cholera epidemic did nothing for the film except to pander needlessly for the Oscar nominations which it got, but not in any major categories.Norton's portrayal of Walter Fane starts out well enough and true to Maugham's original novel, but as the affair is revealed, his character loses the one characteristic he is able to retain in the novel - his bloodlessness.  In the climatic confrontation in the novel, he tells Kitty,  ""I had no illusions about you. I knew you were silly and frivolous and empty-headed. But I loved you. I knew that your aims and ideals were vulgar and commonplace. But I loved you. I knew that you were second-rate. But I loved you. It's comic when I think how hard I tried to be amused by the things that amused you and how anxious I was to hide from you that I wasn't ignorant and vulgar and scandal-mongering and stupid. I knew how frightened you were of intelligence and I did everything I could to make you think me as big a fool as the rest of the men you knew.""The 'veil' that was lifted had nothing to do with his perception of Kitty; the veil was the self-involved cluelessness that Kitty was entrenched in so deeply that she was lured towards the shallow vapidness of Charlie and in the process broke the heart of the one person who loved her despite her weaknesses and asked only that she be loyal to him. Walter wanted only what he had been able and willing to give Kitty - selfless loyalty and affection.Maugham's stories are well-paced, studied and full of emotion. It's a shame that a true version of ""The Painted Veil"" will probably never be seen. Hollywood for the third time neglects the true journey - that of a woman to her own heart, motivation and life - in favor of yet another journey between two people.",2,Did Norton read the right book?,1182124800,"06 18, 2007",2007,2753,"['Good', 'performances', 'strong', 'cinematography', 'exquisite', 'soundtrack', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'version', 'W.', 'Somerset', 'Maugham', 'novel', 'good', 'thing', 'only', 'phantom', 'novel', 'can', 'be', 'pinpointed', 'Kitty', 'search', 'spiritual', 'personal', 'development', 'been', 'shoved', 'side', 'replaced', 'need', 'be', 'loved', 'enigmatic', 'Walter', 'Fane', 'here', 'converted', 'romantic', 'hero', 'far', 'more', 'vocal/expressive', 'was', 'ever', 'meant', 'be', 'page', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'characters', 'needed', 'be', 'altered', 'so', 'dramatically', 'order', 'tell', 'tale', 'matter', 'how', 'distorted.Notable', 'many', 'reviews', 'film', 'was', 'fact', 'many', 'critics', 'found', 'characters', 'unlikeable', 'Well', 'yes', 'were', 'also', 'far', 'more', 'likeable', 'less', 'transformative', 'how', 'were', 'portrayed', 'film', 'Romantizing', 'plot', 'degree', 'where', 'became', 'love', 'secure', 'Chinese', 'seal', 'approval', 'required', 'allow', 'filming', 'distorting', 'Walter', 'role', 'containment', 'cholera', 'epidemic', 'did', 'nothing', 'film', 'pander', 'needlessly', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'got', 'not', 'major', 'categories.Norton', 'portrayal', 'Walter', 'Fane', 'out', 'well', 'enough', 'true', 'Maugham', 'original', 'novel', 'affair', 'revealed', 'character', 'one', 'characteristic', 'able', 'retain', 'novel', 'bloodlessness', 'climatic', 'confrontation', 'novel', 'Kitty', 'had', 'illusions', 'knew', 'were', 'silly', 'frivolous', 'empty-headed', 'loved', 'knew', 'aims', 'ideals', 'were', 'vulgar', 'commonplace', 'loved', 'knew', 'were', 'second-rate', 'loved', 'comic', 'when', 'think', 'how', 'hard', 'tried', 'be', 'amused', 'things', 'amused', 'how', 'anxious', 'was', 'hide', 'was', ""n't"", 'ignorant', 'vulgar', 'scandal-mongering', 'stupid', 'knew', 'how', 'frightened', 'were', 'intelligence', 'did', 'everything', 'could', 'make', 'think', 'big', 'fool', 'rest', 'men', 'knew', ""'veil"", 'was', 'lifted', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'perception', 'Kitty', 'veil', 'was', 'self-involved', 'cluelessness', 'Kitty', 'was', 'entrenched', 'so', 'deeply', 'was', 'lured', 'shallow', 'vapidness', 'Charlie', 'process', 'broke', 'heart', 'one', 'person', 'who', 'loved', 'weaknesses', 'asked', 'only', 'be', 'loyal', 'Walter', 'wanted', 'only', 'what', 'had', 'been', 'able', 'willing', 'give', 'Kitty', 'selfless', 'loyalty', 'affection.Maugham', 'stories', 'are', 'well-paced', 'studied', 'full', 'emotion', 'shame', 'true', 'version', 'Painted', 'Veil', 'will', 'probably', 'never', 'be', 'seen', 'Hollywood', 'third', 'time', 'true', 'journey', 'woman', 'own', 'heart', 'motivation', 'life', 'favor', 'yet', 'journey', 'two', 'people']","PAINTED VEIL, THE (WS) (DVD)"

This beauty alone is worth watching the movie.It is a story of a rich spoiled woman, who marries a man she does not love to escape the fate of ""an old maid"" and her mother's sharp tongue. Her new husband is the 1920's British equivalent of today's geek, he being a MD-bacteriologist stationed in Shanghai. He volunteers to go work with a remote rural village under siege from cholera and backmails his new bride into going with him over an affair she had that he knows about. The plot is their falling in love in the midst of continuing death and danger from anti-foreigner antipathy from the Chinese.The plot is interesting and involving, the beauty of the land overwhelming, the point of the movie poignant and heartmoving. All which make the film excellent thought and viewing pleasure.It would even make a worthwhile movie for a small group discussion over several important issues: the meaning of love and marriage, the importance of believing in something noble and sacrificial service to that ideal.",5,worth watching and even talking to people about,1189900800,"09 16, 2007",2007,1363,"['Confirms', 'idea', 'movies', 'made', 'novels', 'can', 'be', 'best', 'film', 'going', 'fare', 'having', 'plot', 'beginning', 'point', 'satisfactory', 'ending.The', 'movie', 'filmed', 'place', 'karst', 'country', 'southern/SW', 'China', 'beautiful', 'shades', 'green', 'paddy', 'rice', 'tall', 'karsts', 'dominate', 'view', 'just', 'river', 'people', 'lives', 'beauty', 'alone', 'worth', 'watching', 'movie.It', 'story', 'rich', 'spoiled', 'woman', 'who', 'man', 'not', 'love', 'escape', 'fate', 'old', 'maid', 'mother', 'sharp', 'tongue', 'new', 'husband', '1920', 'British', 'equivalent', 'today', 'geek', 'being', 'MD-bacteriologist', 'stationed', 'Shanghai', 'go', 'work', 'remote', 'rural', 'village', 'siege', 'cholera', 'backmails', 'new', 'bride', 'going', 'affair', 'had', 'plot', 'falling', 'love', 'midst', 'continuing', 'death', 'danger', 'anti-foreigner', 'antipathy', 'Chinese.The', 'plot', 'interesting', 'involving', 'beauty', 'land', 'overwhelming', 'point', 'movie', 'poignant', 'heartmoving', 'make', 'film', 'excellent', 'thought', 'viewing', 'pleasure.It', 'would', 'even', 'make', 'worthwhile', 'movie', 'small', 'group', 'discussion', 'several', 'important', 'issues', 'meaning', 'love', 'marriage', 'importance', 'believing', 'something', 'noble', 'sacrificial', 'service', 'ideal']","PAINTED VEIL, THE (WS) (DVD)"

Not only does it have beautiful scenes as promised, but the writing and the actors themselves were quite strong. Norton especially made one memorable and definitely likeable character.From beginning to end I was kept in interest of this story and yes did have a part of me hoping this marriage on the rocks would turn into a finally passionate romance.

Somerset Maugham, is a very well made film. The acting is first-rate, the direction fine and the cinematography often gorgeous. The story, however, lends itself much better to the printed medium rather than the celluloid. I began looking at the clock an hour into this two-hour film, a sign which is never good. This film helps remind us that great filmmaking does not necessarily a great film make. Edward Norton and Naomi Watts, who also produced, play a married English couple living in China during the 1920s. Her love affair with another man, played by Watts' real-life mate Liev Schreiber, should have doomed their marriage. Out of dignity (or is it spite?), Dr. Fane (Norton) takes his wife to the middle of a cholera-stricken town. As a bacteriologist, he feels it is his duty to help eradicate the disease. Will his altruistic nobility influence his selfish young wife? Fans of Maugham, the 1934 film version with Greta Garbo or of the novel itself might find this filmed version of interest, though I would forewarn those looking for either intense drama or satisfactory romance that this one requires a good deal of patience.

1058602,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B000NOIX48,Scott Schiefelbein,"[2, 2]","Ed Norton and Naomi Watts both produced and starred in this 2006 adaptation of W. Somerset Maugham's novel - it's clear from the vibrant opening shots set in a gorgeous Chinese valley that this is a labor of love for these two actors.And indeed, ""labor of love"" is the prime theme of this film.  For while there is undeniably a love story at its root, but in this world, love must be fought for tooth and nail.  There are no breezy romances here.Watts plays Kitty, a spoiled British spinster living under the crushing thumb of her mother.  Norton plays Walter, a bacteriologist who is more comfortable with a microscope than humans, but nevertheless has fallen for Kitty.  Following one of the oddest marriage proposals ever, Kitty and Walter head to Shang-hai, where Walter leads a colonial laboratory.Incidentally, ""PV"" proves the old chestnut that England must be the most boring country in the world because no matter what odd corner of the world you find yourself in, there's probably a British doctor or explorer already there, setting up shop.Bored out of her mind by the limited society of colonial Shang-hai, Kitty has an affair with the local consul, Charlie Townsend (Liev Shreiber, perfectly cast). Walter discovers the infidelity and, perhaps to punish Kitty, forces her to accompany him to the Chinese interior where he must fight an outbreak of cholera.Here is where the movie really takes off.  Walter and Kitty, full of hatred for each other, nevertheless must keep up appearances in this gorgeous but plagued village.  With the help of the local British colonial advisor (Toby Jones), a French nun (Diana Rigg, awesome!) and the grudging help of the local Chinese commander (Anthony Wong), Walter fights to bring change to this rigid society.  The tranquil village is actually a powderkeg of nationalistic fervor, where the Western logical suggestion to move the cemetery away from the drinking water is greeted with rage rather than relief.Watts, Norton, Jones, Rigg, Yu, and the rest of the cast throw themselves into this story with abandon - this is an actors' movie.  The script demands that the actors convey meaning with subtext, not the actual words - British and Chinese societies were too strict to allow for much plain speaking.

Somerset Maugham novel and a remake of a 1934 MGM romance starring Greta Garbo.  Exquisitely photographed all over China in Panavision by Stuart Dryburgh and with a lovely score by Alexandre Desplat, both of whom should have richly received Oscar nominations here, the new movie starts with an act of adultery in 1925 London.  Kitty Fane (Naomi Watts who also produced) cheats on doctor husband Walter (Edward Norton who was also a producer here) with married diplomat lover Charlie (Liev Schreiber).  In a simmering rage, Walter wants to divorce Kitty, but then has a more vicious revenge for her:  join him as they fight a cholera epidemic in a remote Chinese village.The movie is long, slow, languid, with some of the most beautiful scenery and photography of at least the last decade in movies.  Kitty is a proud feminist, while Walter seems to hate his wife.  He ignores her, initially displays no love for her.  So Kitty goes off on her own to explore the cholera village.  She runs into Christian missionaries (one of whom is an unrecognizable, but excellent Diana Rigg).  Naomi Watts and Edward Norton are wondrous in these main roles, probably better than Garbo and Herbert Marshall in the 1934 original film.But then Walter sees that Kitty is coming alive in helping the cholera victims; he comes out of his own shell in graphic hospital scenes as a doctor.  The two make love as husband and wife passionately, and Kitty gets pregnant.  But the father appears to be her married diplomat lover from reel one.  What happens next?  Rent the utterly beautiful and romantic THE PAINTED VEIL and see for yourself.  A box office dud that the studio (Warner Bros. and several production companies) threw away in theaters, the movie now has a chance to recoup its loses on home video.  Be sure to rent or buy the widescreen version; the movie was filmed in Panavision.My friends like to know what MPAA rating a movie got.

1058617,AMNNPDX9MFEUD,B000NOIX48,Steve,"[1, 1]","The film adaptation of the novel The Painted Veil starts off playing things pretty close to the novel, but then veers off in a rather unfortunate manner for my liking. Instead of continuing the story, there are deviations that at first seem unnecessary and then go way off the grid into full-blown distortions.I realize that a movie that comes from a novel should be judged on its own merit. However, once you have read the book the movie is based on (and please spare me the semantic lesson), you feel compelled to compare. Comparing doesn't mean negation of one or the other. It only means that I see the pros and cons of both. Moreover, saying that one should ignore the source material when reviewing a secondary version is like saying one should ignore history lessons when reviewing a historical drama. One could require a critic to allow for a certain amount of artistic freedom, but to state that those freedoms shouldn't be taken into consideration when reviewing the overall product limits the discussion.The Painted Veil is lovely to look at, a solid drama, and a well-acted. It moves well despite being over two hours in length and a character study, and is a pleasant enough indulgence. The casting in particular was nearly flawless (exception being Liev Schreiber as Charlie Townsend), especially with the subtle yet powerful performances from Norton and Watts.The problem I have with TPV is that it differs so unnecessarily from the novel. The novel would've made a perfect movie just as it is, yet there were changes made that added subplots, scenes, and dialogue to the characters that run contrary to the way they were written, and more importantly, add nothing but empty contrivances. If one is going to make a movie that calls itself The Painted Veil and acknowledges the source of the characters, setting, and plot, what good does it do to make additions that do more harm to the source than benefit? Were these done to keep potential ADHD audience members awake, or was it done to pacify those who can't see the past as the past? In other words, were changes made to make the characters more appealing to 21st century viewers who might've been confused by the way people acted in the 1920s? Additionally, as one excellent review pointed out, the gist of the book is altered, e.g. Kitty's transformation is rendered as a mere quest for love. What a sad miscalculation on the part of the director/writer/producers.In the end, I rate the movie about 3.5 stars and wonder how much better it could have been had they not felt the need to paint a bigger smile on the Mona Lisa.",3,If only they'd stayed more faithful to the book...,1360713600,"02 13, 2013",2013,2593,"['film', 'adaptation', 'novel', 'Painted', 'Veil', 'playing', 'things', 'pretty', 'close', 'novel', 'then', 'veers', 'off', 'rather', 'unfortunate', 'manner', 'liking', 'Instead', 'continuing', 'story', 'are', 'deviations', 'first', 'seem', 'unnecessary', 'then', 'go', 'way', 'grid', 'full-blown', 'distortions.I', 'realize', 'movie', 'novel', 'should', 'be', 'judged', 'own', 'merit', 'However', 'once', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'movie', 'based', 'please', 'spare', 'semantic', 'lesson', 'feel', 'compelled', 'compare', 'Comparing', ""n't"", 'mean', 'negation', 'one', 'other', 'only', 'see', 'pros', 'cons', 'Moreover', 'saying', 'one', 'should', 'ignore', 'source', 'material', 'when', 'reviewing', 'secondary', 'version', 'saying', 'one', 'should', 'ignore', 'history', 'lessons', 'when', 'reviewing', 'historical', 'drama', 'One', 'could', 'require', 'critic', 'allow', 'certain', 'amount', 'artistic', 'freedom', 'state', 'freedoms', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'taken', 'consideration', 'when', 'reviewing', 'overall', 'product', 'discussion.The', 'Painted', 'Veil', 'lovely', 'look', 'solid', 'drama', 'well-acted', 'well', 'being', 'over', 'two', 'hours', 'length', 'character', 'study', 'pleasant', 'enough', 'indulgence', 'casting', 'particular', 'was', 'nearly', 'flawless', 'exception', 'being', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'Charlie', 'Townsend', 'especially', 'subtle', 'yet', 'powerful', 'performances', 'Norton', 'Watts.The', 'problem', 'have', 'TPV', 'so', 'unnecessarily', 'novel', 'novel', 'would', ""'ve"", 'made', 'perfect', 'movie', 'just', 'yet', 'were', 'changes', 'made', 'added', 'subplots', 'scenes', 'dialogue', 'characters', 'run', 'contrary', 'way', 'were', 'written', 'more', 'importantly', 'add', 'nothing', 'empty', 'contrivances', 'one', 'going', 'make', 'movie', 'Painted', 'Veil', 'source', 'characters', 'setting', 'plot', 'what', 'good', 'do', 'make', 'additions', 'do', 'more', 'harm', 'source', 'benefit', 'Were', 'done', 'keep', 'potential', 'ADHD', 'audience', 'members', 'awake', 'was', 'done', 'pacify', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'past', 'past', 'other', 'words', 'were', 'changes', 'made', 'make', 'characters', 'more', 'appealing', '21st', 'century', 'viewers', 'who', 'might', ""'ve"", 'been', 'confused', 'way', 'people', 'acted', '1920s', 'Additionally', 'one', 'excellent', 'review', 'pointed', 'out', 'gist', 'book', 'altered', 'e.g', 'Kitty', 'transformation', 'rendered', 'mere', 'quest', 'love', 'What', 'sad', 'miscalculation', 'part', 'director/writer/producers.In', 'end', 'rate', 'movie', '3.5', 'stars', 'wonder', 'how', 'much', 'better', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'not', 'felt', 'need', 'paint', 'bigger', 'smile', 'Mona', 'Lisa']","PAINTED VEIL, THE (WS) (DVD)"

This is a slow-moving story that doesn't need action to be engrossing.  This is a masterpiece that doesn't need improvement.The story is both simple and multi-layered.  Naomi Watts, totally unrecognizable from herThe RingandKing Kongfilms, is basically a spoiled brat who would prefer to live off her father's money than to buy into the trappings of marriage (as she sees it).  In a moment of spiteful rage against her mother, she intentionally marries a ""civil servant"" (one viewed beneath her), extremely well-played by Edward (American History X) Norton who equally disappears into his role as a shy man who is rather infatuated with Watts but respectful of the fact she doesn't love him, but hopes she will one day over time.  This is a time when arranged marriages were common and for a husband to be as respectful as Norton's role is refreshing.  He never forces himself on his wife and she does eventually warm up to him, but considers him a terrible bore.No spoiler here to mention that the first interesting man that comes along, Liev Schreiber who is effectively self-centered, she beds in her own home.  Later, to her surprise, her husband is not only not a blind fool like she thought, but is keenly aware of how people react to situations and has a better understanding of the more base emotions than his self-centered wife.  For all her so-called worldly wisdom, she can't read emotions or people very well at all and has little understanding of the consequences of her own actions as she blames the man she willingly married (to spite her mom) for her own affair because he wasn't interesting to her.In what appears to be retaliation for his wife's callous indiscretion, Norton, who has been quiet and respectful, comes down hard on his wife and volunteers to become a doctor in a remote town in China where they are dropping like flies due to an infectious illness.  He knows it may spell certain death to both of them.  He offers her the choice of an ugly discrediting divorce for infidelity, which will bring down her politician lover, or go with him.  In this time period, that is no choice at all.  She goes with him and, at first, we believe him to be incredibly cruel in doing this until we see him at work.We identify more with Watt's shock at going to this deadly village and are appalled that Norton would do this as ""punishment"" regardless of the terrible thing she did to him, but we gradually learn that he is actually motivated to save others even at great risk to himself and he had been planning this for awhile and at a time when he might have been able to trust his wife to not have affairs.  In addition, either intentionally or unintentionally, we are never sure, Norton gets his wife to see something admirable in him.  He may have seemed initially cruel to his wife and he may well have intended this trip as some kind of punishment to both he and his wife, however, he is a multi-layered character who consistently surprises us (and his wife).  So much for being ""boring.""To give away more would spoil the story, but this is a memorable film that is touching and honest in how it deals with our basic human emotions of love, hate, jealousy, and personal desires.  I highly recommend this film, but I'm aware that this kind of story may not appeal to everyone.  Even if this is not your typical genre, give it a try.

The story, based on a novel by W. Somerset Maugham, takes place during a cholera epidemic in 1925 China, but it's a timeless story and, with the outbreak of infectious disease angle, the film feels remarkably current. The cinematography and acting are superb and apart from some clunky editing the movie is altogether brilliant.But what makes the film so striking to me is its honesty about life. The characters are flawed but real, multi-dimensional and struggling with misconceptions about others, a deep need to love and be loved, and a quiet urge to live a life that matters.Watch this movie but don't study it.

However, the story is not faithful to the book...far from it.The book is a wonderfully multi-dimensional tale of lust, disappointment, and above all, a woman's spiritual awakening.  The film touched only superficially on the first two, totally leaving the third out.The title of the book ""The Painted Veil"" is supposed to point to Kitty's growing understanding that a spiritual world lives beyond the superficial ""veil"" of this one.  Her experience with the nuns and the wrenching experience of her affair and subsequent rejection by her husband leads to her spiritual awakening.  None of that in the film.Rather, the film depicts a rather cliched story of a woman who marries out of necessity, has an affair, then falls in love with her husband and she with him.  Blech.  How boring.Read the book.  It's so much better than the superficial story in the film.(Oh, and another thing.

The Painted Veil is definitely Saturday afternoon rainy day viewing.It's 1920 and her doctor husband is dragging her the long way through the back roads of China.  Flashback two years and we meet Kitty at home where her well-to-do parents never miss a chance to worry out loud that their youngest daughter will soon be too old to find a man.  At a party they've arranged for a young doctor, Walter, to meet her he asks her to dance, followed by the hint of wooing in which he proclaims his love so of course they marry and end up in Shanghai.While Walter works at the local clinic as an epidemiologist Kitty gets bored.  Lucky for philanderer Charlie Townsend.  Walter discovers the torrid affair and signs up for cholera camp taking his unhappy wife away from the city and into the hinterland where cholera is spreading almost as fast as nationalism.The Empire's best days are behind it and things are literally going to s*** for everyone.  Throw in memories of Fitzcaraldo and a pinch of African Queen along with strong performances and a director's touch able to tell the story of catharsis and redemption through moving images more so than through dialogue and you get a sweet little picture with a satisfying ending.This is a re-do of the Greta Garbo film of the same name released in 1934 and based on Somerset Maugham book.

Kitty is self-absorbed and pleasure-seeking, Walter is serious, oriented toward research and service.  Bound to fail, right?  Eharmony would never pair these two...and some marriage counselors would say, ""Forget it.""Others have described the plot very well, I won't repeat it here.  It's easy to downgrade Kitty, she marries for all the wrong reasons...but she's right that virtuous guys can sometimes be boring.  Edward Norton does a fantastic job of portraying the intellectual loner who is originally spellbound by Kitty...so spellbound that he doesn't really relate to her as she is...she is almost an object of worship to him.  Naturally this fails to awaken her passion.  Not that I am meaning to excuse her, just to say that there is room for growth in BOTH people in this movie.  When he is cuckolded, Walter reacts by retreating into rigid rectitude...but we always know that he still loves Kitty, even though he is terribly hurt and cannot believe that she will ever change.  When they begin to open up to each other again, Walter is transformed as well, moving beyond his initial one-dimensional view of Kitty to accept her as a person that he can respect, even though she is still the lighthearted musician who plays for the orphans to dance.  He is more of a man, and she has grown into womanhood by falling in love with his virtue...not just any virtue, but HIS.It's a fine movie.  Not slow, unless you have no taste for nuance and beauty.  Waddington and his Chinese girlfriend are a sort of Mozartian parallel couple (Papageno/Papagena) to Walter and Kitty (Tamino/Pamina).  It is clear from the brief focus on the girlfriend that she truly loves Waddington. Kitty's realization of this is a turning point, and this scene is masterfully acted by all.On top of all that, the music, from French folk song to Satie, is used with perfect appropriateness to the action.

How about the missing chemistry between the actors--not just the missing sexual chemistry, as it is a story of a mismatch (and by the way, mismatches in real life never become more than that) but it is as if they are in completely different movies.Naomi Watts did not pull off the psych-sexual guilt-desire slave well, and then the rebuff renders her as flat as a pancake.  She's like a half-character wandering around looking for a personality to jump into.I won't give away more than that, don't think this is a spoiler.  The other thing, perhaps Americans are very tolerant of bad English accents, but Norton's ""Brit"" was fake--it drove me nuts.  I'm sorry, but if you're going to be an American taking on a British accent, then do it like Meryl Streep or shut the hell up.Further to the botched accent, Norton was oddly wooden...not in a stuck up high soceity sort of way either, but stiff, reflexive, rote.  Ordinarily, I expect great things of Edward Norton, who remains on my top 10 actor list, as soon as he comes to his senses, stops producing vanity projects and gets into some real meat--I'm used to depth from this young man.In short, the entire film hangs on the performance of Watts and Norton, and both are in their own universes.

The movie doesn't disappoint. Naomi Watts plays a London socialite, Kitty who for want of better suitors & a desperate desire to get away from her controlling mother accepts Walter's [Edward Norton] proposal and accompanies him to Shanghai, China. She soon gets bored with Walter, and finds herself embroiled in a passionate affair with the married British Vice-Consul, Charles Townsend [Liev Shreiber]. The affair however is doomed because Charles is a lothario who enjoys his fun too much for lasting emotional attachments. Kitty finds herself being found out, and Walter exacts his revenge by compelling Kitty to accompany him to a remote village where cholera is rampant. The rest of the movie deals with the emotional complexities of two tormented souls who are brought together under harsh and unforgiving circumstances and learn to come to terms with each other. The two leads here are compelling and believable in their roles, and in fact though Watts and Shreiber are a real-life couple, what struck me more was the great chemistry between Watts and Norton. The cinematography is simply beautiful, evoking the lush Chinese rural landscape, and the score is equally haunting. There are also good supporting roles here - the Mother Superior [Diana Rigg], Shreiber and a few others all add to the emotional depth of this very human drama. All in all, a very poignant study of the complexities of human relationships.",5,"A moving story, stellar acting & beautiful cinematography!",1180483200,"05 30, 2007",2007,1663,"['watched', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'had', 'loved', 'Somerset', 'Maugham', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'have', 'deep', 'respect', 'acting', 'talents', 'Naomi', 'Watts', '[', '21', 'Grams', ']', 'also', 'Edward', 'Norton', '[', 'American', 'History', 'X', 'Down', 'Valley', ']', 'movie', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'London', 'socialite', 'Kitty', 'who', 'want', 'better', 'suitors', 'desperate', 'desire', 'get', 'away', 'controlling', 'mother', 'accepts', 'Walter', '[', 'Edward', 'Norton', ']', 'proposal', 'Shanghai', 'China', 'soon', 'bored', 'Walter', 'embroiled', 'passionate', 'affair', 'married', 'British', 'Vice-Consul', 'Charles', 'Townsend', '[', 'Liev', 'Shreiber', ']', 'affair', 'however', 'doomed', 'Charles', 'lothario', 'who', 'fun', 'too', 'much', 'lasting', 'emotional', 'attachments', 'Kitty', 'being', 'found', 'Walter', 'revenge', 'compelling', 'Kitty', 'accompany', 'remote', 'village', 'where', 'cholera', 'rampant', 'rest', 'movie', 'deals', 'emotional', 'complexities', 'two', 'tormented', 'souls', 'who', 'are', 'brought', 'together', 'harsh', 'unforgiving', 'circumstances', 'learn', 'come', 'terms', 'other', 'two', 'leads', 'here', 'are', 'compelling', 'believable', 'roles', 'fact', 'Watts', 'Shreiber', 'are', 'real-life', 'couple', 'what', 'struck', 'more', 'was', 'great', 'chemistry', 'Watts', 'Norton', 'cinematography', 'simply', 'beautiful', 'evoking', 'lush', 'Chinese', 'rural', 'landscape', 'score', 'equally', 'haunting', 'are', 'also', 'good', 'supporting', 'roles', 'here', 'Mother', 'Superior', '[', 'Diana', 'Rigg', ']', 'Shreiber', 'few', 'others', 'add', 'emotional', 'depth', 'very', 'human', 'drama', 'very', 'poignant', 'study', 'complexities', 'human', 'relationships']","PAINTED VEIL, THE (WS) (DVD)"
