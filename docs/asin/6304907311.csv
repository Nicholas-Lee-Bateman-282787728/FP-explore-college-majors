Now, through re-enactments and footage of his career, Grinkov's memory is brought to life through this touching documentary, &quot;My Sergei&quot;.At age 15 Grinkov was paired with fellow Russian skater, 11-year old Ekaterina Gordeeva. Though the two were different ages and heights (he was about 2 heads taller than she), they became the greatest pairs team in the history of the sport. In 1986, their first year in senior competition, they won the World Championships. Two years later, at ages 16 and 21, they became Olympic gold medalists in Calgary. The world was introduced to, and fell in love with, Gordeeva and Grinkov - G&amp;G.Two years later the duo turned pro, got married, and won the hearts of fans the world over. Through Stars on Ice, they reached American audiences with their graceful and emotional routines, always consummately performed with style. When they returned to Olympic competition in 1994, there was no doubt that they would win gold again -- and they did. Within two years, however, Sergei was dead, and skating would never be the same.Told through the eyes of Grinkov's partner and widow, Katia Gordeeva, this documentary is a joyous and touching film, as it reveals the life and loss of one of skating's greatest athletes.",5,A Touching Film,1038614400,"11 30, 2002",2002,1438,"['20', 'November', '1995', 'figure', 'skating', 'lost', 'one', 'greatest', 'athletes', 'ever', 'when', 'Russian', 'pairs', 'skater', 'Sergei', 'Grinkov', 'collapsed', 'died', 'practice', 'Lake', 'Placid', 'New', 'York', 'Now', 're-enactments', 'footage', 'career', 'Grinkov', 'memory', 'brought', 'life', 'touching', 'documentary', 'quot', 'My', 'Sergei', 'quot', '.At', 'age', '15', 'Grinkov', 'was', 'paired', 'fellow', 'Russian', 'skater', '11-year', 'old', 'Ekaterina', 'Gordeeva', 'two', 'were', 'different', 'ages', 'heights', 'was', 'about', '2', 'heads', 'taller', 'became', 'greatest', 'pairs', 'team', 'history', 'sport', '1986', 'first', 'year', 'senior', 'competition', 'won', 'World', 'Championships', 'Two', 'years', 'later', 'ages', '16', '21', 'became', 'Olympic', 'gold', 'medalists', 'Calgary', 'world', 'was', 'introduced', 'fell', 'love', 'Gordeeva', 'Grinkov', 'G', 'amp', 'G.Two', 'years', 'later', 'duo', 'turned', 'pro', 'got', 'married', 'won', 'hearts', 'fans', 'world', 'Stars', 'Ice', 'reached', 'American', 'audiences', 'graceful', 'emotional', 'routines', 'always', 'consummately', 'performed', 'style', 'When', 'returned', 'Olympic', 'competition', '1994', 'was', 'doubt', 'would', 'win', 'gold', 'again', 'did', 'two', 'years', 'however', 'Sergei', 'was', 'dead', 'skating', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'same.Told', 'eyes', 'Grinkov', 'partner', 'widow', 'Katia', 'Gordeeva', 'documentary', 'joyous', 'touching', 'film', 'life', 'loss', 'one', 'skating', 'greatest', 'athletes']",My Sergei VHS

And, I'm not a person that cries easily. They were the best pairs skaters that ever were and the world will never see anything like them again.  Yes, there had been excellent pairs skaters before and will be again but never again will we see love and beauty as well as perfection brought onto the ice like they brought it.  I'm old enough to remember when they were winning Olympic gold medals and figure skating was so popular that there were many specials on t.v.  So, I saw them many, many times and actually still have tapes of most of the Olympics they skated in.  Every now and then I look at them again just to watch perfection and to experience as much as I can the love that was between them. I also read the book.  I can see that this tape will be one of my treasures.  Thanks. LATER:  O.K. I finished watching it and still say it is a TREASURE.  I was surprised to see so many full length performances on this tape, some of them from the very start of their career and I'm thrilled to have these.

Gordeeva was only 16, Grinkov only 22, but their talent was tremendous. They hadn't paired up romantically yet but it was obvious they were a duo to be reckoned with. By the 1994 Winter Olympics in Norway they had married and had a daughter and won Gold again. Sadly, just a year later Grinkov died suddenly and left a widow of 24 alone with a toddler. Their love story is heartwarming and probably one of the most enduring real life tales in figure skating history. This video is a testament to twin flames on ice and off.

From the begining I was a fan of Ekaterina Gordeeva and Sergei Grinkov the skating team.Though very well done, this video is not what I expected. I  was expecting something more like a &quot;movie of the week.&quot; Examples  of this would be, &quot;The Grace Kelly Story&quot; or &quot;Seleena.&quot;  Movies done with actors. That said... Dispite my mild disappointment this  is a great video.&quot;My Sergei,&quot; is more like a docudrama told  through the eyes of Ekaterina Gordeeva. Ekaterina narrates the video as she  refects on her life with Sergei. Through Ekaterina's refections, we re-live  some Gordeeva and Grinkov Staking moments. We witness a budding romance,  the happiness, and the grieving from the loss of Sergei. As well as, the  move forward for Ekaterina and her daughter.&quot;My Sergei,&quot; is a  fairytale cut short.
