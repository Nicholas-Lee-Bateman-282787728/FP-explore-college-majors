McLaughlin has only gotten better with age, and seems to have fun playing with his fellow great musicians. Songs from past CDs are expanded and improvised on with this live concert DVD. I've been a fan since 1972 and listen to one of my McLaughlin CDs four times a week. Even after 100 listenings I still hear new things. The world's greatest living guitar player is in fine form on this DVD. I highly recommend it to fans or newbies looking to listen outside the boombox.

1233130,A1X73QJ7D1W57Q,B001REZMF6,Bodhi Heeren,"[15, 15]","This fabulous show, recorded live in Belgrade by Serbian TV, confirms the impression that the illustrious guitarvirtuoso never has sounded better than here in his mid 60s. Playing as visionary and innovative as ever, constantly going for the edge. And the more conservative John McLaughlin fans make take comfort in the fact that he here mostly plays his slightly phased jazzguitar, rarely using the laptop for synth effects.The band is stellar with the versatile Gary Husband playing keys and sometimes supplementing Mark Mondesir on the drums. Whereas Dominique di Piazza is downright outstanding on the bass. I guess he might top my list of 'underrated basslegends'. Actually he had to jump in with short notice when the bands original bassplayer, the young superstar Hadrien Feraud had a fingerinjury. Di Piazza, a catholic pater, played with Mclaughlin on the landmark ""Que Allegria"" album and fortunately we get his feature number from that album ""Hijacked"". But that's really only one of several jawdropping solos, superfast but at the same time artistic and creative.No Mahavishnu classics, but 3 songs from the brilliant ""Floating Point""album, and the gorgous ballad ""Nostalgia"" from the MO3 period.Like the Five Peace Band with Chick Corea this is fusion at its absolute best.

1233131,A1MIOM02T6AP6S,B001REZMF6,Dennis P. Laforce,"[12, 18]","I just watched this dvd so I thought I would put some thoughts down while it was fresh in my mind.  I would highly recommend this to those who enjoy a group of extremely busy players with mega chops constantly blowing the doors off.  If thats what you are into then this dvd is for you.  And while I did like the show,  quite frankly Mclaughlin's playing leaves me a bit flat in the emotional category.  Like a hummingbird that is constantly flapping it's wings, John is never content to just let his playing soar some.  There are very few sustained notes here, mostly high speed runs, and the rest of his group also play the same way.  The bass player sounds like John on the bass and both the keyboard player and drummer are very busy players, taking the lead from the boss.  So what you get is 2 hours of over the top, however masterful playing, that leaves this listener a bit bored and cold.  The dvd does have excellent production values however so well done there.  Just not my cup of tea.  I would recommend the Mike Stern New Morning dvd instead.  By comparison he is a guitar player equal to Mclaughlin chops wise but isn't afraid to let the music soar some too.  He knows when to beat his wings but he also knows when to stop beating and soar with the music.  I guess John forgot everything he ever learned from Miles.  He should go back and listen to some of his own playing while he was with the master and even into his Mahavishnu days.  Too much is just too much.

There is no treble sound and even when I tried several times to noodle and tweak the sound on my high-def stereo, nothing worked. The bass is overbearing and distorts too much, such that no one can be heard over it. Even the drums are in the mix and add to the awful sound quality. 4th Dimension Band has some guys that know their chops, but there really is no way any of them can be heard because the recording is so flawed. One wonders what the heck the sound crew was smoking when this was recorded in Belgrade. Although the stage floor appears to be plywood, even a reflex speaker that bounces sound off the floor would not cause that much muddiness. For a die hard John fan like me, it's disappointing. Great music, but really crappy sound. That's why my rating is so low.",2,"Terrible Sound Quality, but great band...",1400716800,"05 22, 2014",2014,892,"['especially', 'first', 'song', 'DVD', 'Soaring', 'majestic', 'powerful', 'However', 'sound-quality', 'terrible', 'treble', 'sound', 'even', 'when', 'tried', 'several', 'times', 'noodle', 'tweak', 'sound', 'high-def', 'stereo', 'nothing', 'worked', 'bass', 'overbearing', 'distorts', 'too', 'much', 'such', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'heard', 'Even', 'drums', 'are', 'mix', 'add', 'awful', 'sound', 'quality', '4th', 'Dimension', 'Band', 'guys', 'know', 'chops', 'there', 'really', 'way', 'can', 'be', 'heard', 'recording', 'so', 'flawed', 'One', 'what', 'heck', 'sound', 'crew', 'was', 'smoking', 'when', 'was', 'recorded', 'Belgrade', 'stage', 'floor', 'be', 'plywood', 'even', 'reflex', 'speaker', 'sound', 'floor', 'would', 'not', 'cause', 'much', 'muddiness', 'die', 'hard', 'John', 'fan', 'disappointing', 'Great', 'music', 'really', 'crappy', 'sound', 'why', 'rating', 'so', 'low']",John McLaughlin and the 4th Dimension - Live At Belgrade
