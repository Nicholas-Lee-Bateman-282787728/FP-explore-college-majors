1594780,A1Q6PG0Y3XZL7M,B009CI8S6Y,"Book & Music thief, from HI","[2, 2]","The term 'Lost Treasure' must have been invented for this comedy series, which I never thought would ever see the light of DVD!  This show ran for only 13 episodes during the 1975-76 broadcast season.  It was actually co-created by the great Mel Brooks (at the height of his creative powers, right after Blazing Saddles, and Young Frankenstein).  I was really young, like in 3rd grade, when it was on - but I actually remember loving this show - and being very depressed, when it was suddenly canceled (it wasn't until the Monty Python series started being shown in America, on PBS, about a year later - that my comedy spirits brightened again!)  I am surprised that I was actually able to still remember a number of episodes quite well, when I re-watched them on DVD recently (I guess this show had such an impact, on my 8 year old brain, that it was somehow 'burned' in memory - but now I'm thinking, I couldn't have really understood all those requisite Mel Brooks' 'double-entendre' jokes at that age could I, who knows?  What's more mysterious, is that Monty Python seemed completely understandable a year later, at the ripe old age of 9 years?!  But back to Brooks' small-screen masterpiece = The writing was top-notch, acting spot-on (and appropriately over-the-top).  I really don't understand why this show was not a Big/Huge Hit at the time!  To sum up,  this is certainly not 'high brow' humor - but it is just about as good/ Funny as it gets (much better, more inspired than the later film:  ""Robin Hood, Men in Tights"").  Order this DVD for yourself, before it goes out-of-print again - for another 30 something years!note: Mel Brooks recently received the American Film Institute (AFI) Lifetime Achievement Award = Richly deserved, since Young Frankenstein, Blazing Saddles, and (the original film version of) The Producers, are among the funniest, and best written comedy films ever made (along with Annie Hall, Sleeper, Bananas, and ""Love & Death"" -written & directed by W. Allen - with scribe assist by Brickman on the first two, and of course, big/heavy assist from Tolstoy, on the Last one - didn't ""War & Peace"" keep you in stitches, when you read it in college, especially the first 900 pages!)",5,"Absolutely hilarious!

I don;t want to  review the DVD-it isnt relwased yet. But i am wondering if someone sought out this rare series to release to DVD...can other rare one season or less series be coming to DVD? I hope so---let's go--release DELTA HOUSE, CAPTAIN NICE, MR TERRIFIC (they had to ban that show from American Syndication-the main character gained stregth by swallowing a large  white Pill). TV censors used to ban and edit episodes of any show in which a character would swallow pills. They used to edit pills out of the ABC BATMAN  series in syndication (BATMAN used to take BAT PILLS) and UNDERDOG..they used to edit out all the pill swallowing scenes lol).

It is basically an &#34;Airplane&#34; type of comedy with those typeof gags, but after watching a bit of this, I don't find it nearly as good.  It stlll has funny parts, including a BLACK KNIGHT  who wasreally black, a very rare sight in Europe back then. And there are other funny spots, so I gave this three stars.  The video images arevery good quality but of course 4 x 3 format for old style TVs.  Still, I love satire on history and this show has its moments but  itwas not on the network very long.

Mel Brook's &#34;When Things Were Rotten&#34;  is silly, stupid, full of sight gags, and nothing more than that.But I found it enjoyable. This particular take-off of Robin Hood is just plain fun. Henry Polic II (who just passed away) gives a wonderful hammy, vaudeville like performance as the evil Sherriff of Nottingham and Misty Rowe is just wonderful and beautiful as Maid Marion. Dick Gautier, Bernie Kopell, and Dick Van Patten are all  great in their respective roles, and while the series was short-lived, it did have its strengths, especially for those who love their comedy broad.Perfect for litte kids, who love cartoons (it is a cartoon), and has absolutely no questionable humor or any politically correct message.
