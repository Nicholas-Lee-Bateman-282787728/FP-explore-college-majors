Plus, as I had only ever seen it on a black & white television, it was a pleasant surprise to see that it was in technicolor.  Unfortunately, my delight was severely muted by the poor transfer.  As other reviewers have remarked, the picture is dark, and, on my copy, the sound in several places has undertones that I can only describe as large marbles running along wooden planks.A great movie like this deserves better treatment.",3,A great movie spoilt by a poor transfer.,1357603200,"01 8, 2013",2013,547,"['had', 'been', 'looking', 'film', 'years', 'was', 'delighted', 'see', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'had', 'finally', 'realeased', 'had', 'only', 'ever', 'seen', 'black', 'white', 'television', 'was', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'see', 'was', 'technicolor', 'Unfortunately', 'delight', 'was', 'severely', 'muted', 'poor', 'transfer', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'remarked', 'picture', 'dark', 'copy', 'sound', 'several', 'places', 'undertones', 'can', 'only', 'describe', 'large', 'marbles', 'running', 'along', 'wooden', 'planks.A', 'great', 'movie', 'better', 'treatment']",Swanee River

That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  I first saw this movie on television decades ago and wanted to see if it was available on DVD but didn't remember what the movie's title was.  I knew Al Jolson was in it so I looked under The Jolson Story and eventually came across what I hoped was the movie I had been searching for for so long.  I watched it and was well pleased to find the movie I had been searching for..The movie may not be completely historically accurate but it includes several of Stephen Foster's songs that Al Jolson sings.  The movie ends with what is assumed to be Foster's last song, &#34;Swanee River.&#34;  However, I have always been led to believe the last song he wrote was &#34;Beautiful Dreamer.&#34;Despite the misgivings of various reviewers here if you enjoy Stephen Foster's songs I think you will enjoy this movie.  I enjoy his songs and I didn't let the listed defects in the movie ruin it for me.

1594768,AEDE8DTYD94BS,B009CCL7S6,James,"[3, 3]","I was not distracted by the irregularities in the movie reproduction, after all it is from 1939! My copy played very well on my computer.  The production of this movie reminded me of ""Gone with the Wind"" which came out the same year, along with the Wizard of Oz, both of which overshadowed this movie.The depiction of Foster's life was well done, even though there were some scenes, admittedly, that seemed contrived. Unfortunately, we don't know all the historical facts about his life, and, so, this creates some room for ""artistic license"". In one scene, Foster, played by Don Ameche, sings ""My Old Kentucky Home"" to Cristy's audience, with a beautiful, resonant baritone voice, even although there is no historic evidence that Foster ever performed his own songs publically. Toward the end of Foster's life when his career was in decline due to alcoholism and a change in public mood regarding his music, Cristy seeks him out in the slums of New York City offering his help, but there is no historic record of this meeting, to my knowledge. Nevertheless, the depiction of the E.P. Cristy Minstrel show, with Al Jolsen, was fantastic.  Al Jolsen has a great voice and replicated the Cristy Minstrel show beautifully. This may be as close to how these songs were heard originally back in the 1850s. Don Ameche does a great job in the title role as do the other supporting actors.  The music in this DVD is great.  This movie was much better than the 1959 remake, ""Jennie with the Light Brown Hair"", both of which are ""a must"" for Stephen Foster fans.",5,A must for Stephen Foster fans!,1371859200,"06 22, 2013",2013,1552,"['was', 'not', 'distracted', 'irregularities', 'movie', 'reproduction', '1939', 'copy', 'played', 'very', 'well', 'computer', 'production', 'movie', 'reminded', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'came', 'out', 'same', 'year', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'overshadowed', 'movie.The', 'depiction', 'Foster', 'life', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'even', 'were', 'scenes', 'admittedly', 'seemed', 'contrived', 'Unfortunately', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'historical', 'facts', 'life', 'so', 'room', 'artistic', 'license', 'one', 'scene', 'Foster', 'played', 'Don', 'Ameche', 'Old', 'Kentucky', 'Home', 'Cristy', 'audience', 'beautiful', 'resonant', 'baritone', 'voice', 'even', 'historic', 'evidence', 'Foster', 'ever', 'performed', 'own', 'songs', 'publically', 'end', 'Foster', 'life', 'when', 'career', 'was', 'decline', 'due', 'alcoholism', 'change', 'public', 'mood', 'regarding', 'music', 'Cristy', 'out', 'slums', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'offering', 'help', 'historic', 'record', 'meeting', 'knowledge', 'Nevertheless', 'depiction', 'E.P', 'Cristy', 'Minstrel', 'show', 'Al', 'Jolsen', 'was', 'fantastic', 'Al', 'Jolsen', 'great', 'voice', 'replicated', 'Cristy', 'Minstrel', 'show', 'beautifully', 'may', 'be', 'close', 'how', 'songs', 'were', 'heard', 'originally', 'back', '1850s', 'Don', 'Ameche', 'great', 'job', 'title', 'role', 'do', 'other', 'supporting', 'actors', 'music', 'DVD', 'great', 'movie', 'was', 'much', 'better', '1959', 'remake', 'Jennie', 'Light', 'Brown', 'Hair', 'are', 'must', 'Stephen', 'Foster', 'fans']",Swanee River

1594771,A2JTK7ZFN02W9A,B009CCL7S6,Mark S. Crawford,"[0, 0]","Fans of Stephen Foster know there were three bio-pics made of his life. Released in 1939, ""Swanee River"" was the first. I like Don Ameche as an actor, however, there's not much opportunity in the film for Ameche to portray the drama and deep moods that Foster experienced. For example, there's not much drama when Foster's wife and child leave him, nor does the film effectively show his slide into drinking. This could be more a product of the times; not everything was as graphic and explicit as in today's movies. In addition, most of the support roles are somewhat forgetable. The noted exception was Al Jolson. It's fun to see him have so much screen time, doing what he did best. His recreation of a mintrel show was entertaining and informative. At the time of the movie's release, minstrel shows may not have been the most popular form of entertainment, but they would have still been familiar to many people.Several reviews mention bad transfers, including scenes being too dark, or too light. My copy played fine.The movie doesn't have the realism that contemporary audiences are use to, but Foster fans will appreciate how the songs are highlighted. In fact, sometimes it seemed like the makers of the film tried to write scenes as an excuse to include certain songs. Also, the film ""tweaks"" the facts a little, but then the film is far from a documentary and meant as way to feature Foster's many well known songs. The movie may not be entertaining to everyone, and I gave it a 5 more out of repect for Foster's legacy.",5,The Best of the Three,1375315200,"08 1, 2013",2013,1531,"['Fans', 'Stephen', 'Foster', 'know', 'were', 'three', 'bio-pics', 'made', 'life', 'Released', '1939', 'Swanee', 'River', 'was', 'first', 'Don', 'Ameche', 'actor', 'however', 'not', 'much', 'opportunity', 'film', 'Ameche', 'portray', 'drama', 'deep', 'moods', 'Foster', 'experienced', 'example', 'not', 'much', 'drama', 'when', 'Foster', 'wife', 'child', 'leave', 'film', 'effectively', 'show', 'slide', 'drinking', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'product', 'times', 'not', 'everything', 'was', 'graphic', 'explicit', 'today', 'movies', 'addition', 'most', 'support', 'roles', 'are', 'somewhat', 'forgetable', 'noted', 'exception', 'was', 'Al', 'Jolson', 'fun', 'see', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'doing', 'what', 'did', 'best', 'recreation', 'mintrel', 'show', 'was', 'entertaining', 'informative', 'time', 'movie', 'release', 'minstrel', 'shows', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'most', 'popular', 'form', 'entertainment', 'would', 'have', 'still', 'been', 'familiar', 'many', 'people.Several', 'reviews', 'mention', 'bad', 'transfers', 'including', 'scenes', 'being', 'too', 'dark', 'too', 'light', 'copy', 'played', 'fine.The', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'realism', 'contemporary', 'audiences', 'are', 'use', 'Foster', 'fans', 'will', 'appreciate', 'how', 'songs', 'are', 'highlighted', 'fact', 'seemed', 'makers', 'film', 'tried', 'write', 'scenes', 'excuse', 'include', 'certain', 'songs', 'Also', 'film', 'tweaks', 'facts', 'little', 'then', 'film', 'far', 'documentary', 'meant', 'way', 'feature', 'Foster', 'many', 'well', 'known', 'songs', 'movie', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'entertaining', 'everyone', 'gave', '5', 'more', 'repect', 'Foster', 'legacy']",Swanee River
