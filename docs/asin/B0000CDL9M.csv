775586,A1534MBU6VJXYN,B0000CDL9M,"Anthony Nasti ""Tony""","[2, 2]","Recorded less than two years before his untimely death, this is Bob in all his glory. Full of energy and spirituality, Bob commands the stage with his timeless music and lasting message of hope, faith, unity, and equality. His accompanying band, The Wailers are also in fine form, and the audience is very involved with the performance and adds greatly to the atmosphere.The songs featured a veritable mixture of Bob classics with a few rarer numbers thrown in. Among the highlights are the opening ""Positive Vibration,"" a powerful ""I Shot The Sheriff,"" a lively ""Africa Unite,"" a passionate ""One Drop,"" a bouncy ""So Much Things To Say,"" the legendary ""Jammin',"" a beautiful ""Is This Love,"" a nosstalgic ""Stir It Up,"" and a fiery ""Get Up, Stand Up,"" among others. The major high point however, is the blistering rendition of ""Exodus,"" perform with a soulfulness and energy not heard even on the album version. Bob also performs several songs from what would be his final album, ""Survival,"" all of which he performs beautifully.The dvd comes with several bonus features that are a t reat for Marley fans. The booklet, with liner notes by Chris Salewicz, is a very detailed behind the scenes look at the show as well as the tour, and is beautifully written. There's several bonus features on the dvd. The documentary ""Prophecies & Messages"" is a great archival look at Bob, Salewicz gives a nice video interview, we get a bonus performance, ""War / No More Trouble,"" an interview fans at Bob's November 27, 1979 show at The Roxy Theatre in L.A. to benefit The Sugar Ray Robinson foundation, and an interview with Wailers keyboardist Tyrone Downie about Rastafarianism.This dvd is an excellent look at Bob and his impact on the word as well as his fans. It is a must for all fans of Bob, his music and his message.",5,One Of The Best Concert DVDs Available.,1203638400,"02 22, 2008",2008,1810,"['Recorded', 'less', 'two', 'years', 'untimely', 'death', 'Bob', 'glory', 'Full', 'energy', 'spirituality', 'Bob', 'stage', 'timeless', 'music', 'lasting', 'message', 'hope', 'faith', 'unity', 'equality', 'accompanying', 'band', 'Wailers', 'are', 'also', 'fine', 'form', 'audience', 'very', 'involved', 'performance', 'greatly', 'atmosphere.The', 'songs', 'featured', 'veritable', 'mixture', 'Bob', 'classics', 'few', 'rarer', 'numbers', 'thrown', 'highlights', 'are', 'opening', 'Positive', 'Vibration', 'powerful', 'Shot', 'Sheriff', 'lively', 'Africa', 'Unite', 'passionate', 'One', 'Drop', 'bouncy', 'So', 'Much', 'Things', 'Say', 'legendary', 'Jammin', 'beautiful', 'Love', 'nosstalgic', 'Stir', 'Up', 'fiery', 'Get', 'Up', 'Stand', 'Up', 'others', 'major', 'high', 'point', 'however', 'blistering', 'rendition', 'Exodus', 'perform', 'soulfulness', 'energy', 'not', 'heard', 'even', 'album', 'version', 'Bob', 'also', 'several', 'songs', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'final', 'album', 'Survival', 'beautifully.The', 'dvd', 'several', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 't', 'reat', 'Marley', 'fans', 'booklet', 'liner', 'notes', 'Chris', 'Salewicz', 'very', 'detailed', 'scenes', 'look', 'show', 'as', 'well', 'tour', 'beautifully', 'written', 'several', 'bonus', 'features', 'dvd', 'documentary', 'Prophecies', 'Messages', 'great', 'archival', 'look', 'Bob', 'Salewicz', 'nice', 'video', 'interview', 'get', 'bonus', 'performance', 'War', '/', 'No', 'More', 'Trouble', 'interview', 'fans', 'Bob', 'November', '27', '1979', 'show', 'Roxy', 'Theatre', 'L.A.', 'benefit', 'Sugar', 'Ray', 'Robinson', 'foundation', 'interview', 'Wailers', 'keyboardist', 'Tyrone', 'Downie', 'Rastafarianism.This', 'dvd', 'excellent', 'look', 'Bob', 'impact', 'word', 'as', 'well', 'fans', 'must', 'fans', 'Bob', 'music', 'message']",N/A

The concert is superb, but what also sets this DVD apart is the 51 minutes ""Prophesies and Messages"" in the bonus materials.  This gives a brief documentary on Bob Marley's life and history of the band, but focuses most heavily on his belief system in Rastafari, with an in-depth interview that is missing from most other documentaries I've seen. You will get to see him explain in his own words his faith and on the cures to the ails of our world, still relevant more than two decades later.  Other members of the band are also interviewed in this press conference.  This section of dialogue is fully sub-titled, although the concert itself is not subtitled.  Although he was already sick at the time of this concert, the performance does not show it.  If anything his work became more sharp and focused.  It also has ""Kinky Reggae"".  The viewer can participate with the audience in ""Stand Up"" calling back ""Y yo-yo yo-yo"".  You just feel the energy.  There is also an overview by Chris Salewicz, the author of several Marley biographies. Sorry to see it is out of print.  Just a great concert all the way around.",5,Great Concert & Bonus Materials,1356480000,"12 26, 2012",2012,1262,"['Having', 'already', 'seen', 'Legend', 'Live', 'Rainbow', 'was', 'third', 'full', 'concert', 'DVD', 'renting', 'Netflix', 'put', 'must', 'own', 'wishlist', 'concert', 'superb', 'what', 'also', 'DVD', 'apart', '51', 'minutes', 'Prophesies', 'Messages', 'bonus', 'materials', 'brief', 'documentary', 'Bob', 'Marley', 'life', 'history', 'band', 'most', 'heavily', 'belief', 'system', 'Rastafari', 'in-depth', 'interview', 'missing', 'most', 'other', 'documentaries', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'will', 'get', 'see', 'explain', 'own', 'words', 'faith', 'cures', 'ails', 'world', 'still', 'more', 'two', 'decades', 'later', 'Other', 'members', 'band', 'are', 'also', 'interviewed', 'press', 'conference', 'section', 'dialogue', 'fully', 'sub-titled', 'concert', 'not', 'subtitled', 'was', 'already', 'sick', 'time', 'concert', 'performance', 'not', 'show', 'anything', 'work', 'became', 'more', 'sharp', 'focused', 'also', 'Kinky', 'Reggae', 'viewer', 'can', 'participate', 'audience', 'Stand', 'Up', 'calling', 'back', 'Y', 'yo-yo', 'yo-yo', 'just', 'feel', 'energy', 'also', 'overview', 'Chris', 'Salewicz', 'author', 'several', 'Marley', 'biographies', 'Sorry', 'see', 'print', 'Just', 'great', 'concert', 'way']",N/A

Whoever engineered the audio aspect of this dvd obviously didn't know that they were doing, because it was irritating at best. It gets a little old having to turn the volume down between practically every song on this dvd, but the performances themselves were excellent. I would definitely recommend this one over some of the more sketchy Bob Marley offerings, but ""Live at the Rainbow"" is clearly head and shoulders above the rest.",4,"Excellent live Bob Marley offering, with one flaw....",1258329600,"11 16, 2009",2009,521,"['love', 'dvd', 'overmodulation', 'audience', 'applause', 'was', 'bit', 'overwhelming', 'engineered', 'audio', 'aspect', 'dvd', 'obviously', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'were', 'doing', 'was', 'irritating', 'best', 'little', 'old', 'having', 'turn', 'volume', 'down', 'practically', 'song', 'dvd', 'performances', 'were', 'excellent', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'one', 'more', 'sketchy', 'Bob', 'Marley', 'offerings', 'Live', 'Rainbow', 'clearly', 'head', 'shoulders', 'rest']",N/A
