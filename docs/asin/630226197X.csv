They did three other films together,1976's SILVER STREAK with Jill Clayburgh,1980's STIR CRAZY and 1989's SEE NO EVIL HEAR NO EVIL. In this film Pryor is a conman who befriends Wilder. Wilder's character does a great deal of lying(he plays a dual role). Great support from Stephen Lang and Mercedes Ruehl. Ruehl is Elaine,the wife of Wilder's character. Memorable scenes include Wilder's character being scared by Frankenstein in a haunted mansion,also faking a corpse at a funeral(he thanks those who attended). Vanessa Williams is Gloria,who Pryor's character takes romantic interest in. In the final scene,Pryor,Wilder,Ruehl and Williams are on vacation in Hawaii. Pryor and Wilder have a picture taken with them both holding a sign that reads ""Partners Forever"".

Without knowing these facts until a moment ago, my reaction to the film was that Pryor lacked the energy that had characterized his earlier performances; Wilder still performed with zest,  yet, it would seem to me, the phenomenon of which George Burns(regarding he and his wife, Gracie) and Jerry Lewis, among others, have spoken, that at a certain age, the characters with whom once they were very successful, now were too young for them to play credibly. Clearly Wilder found that  the fey youthful character he had created no longer suited him.  Nonetheless, there are enough funny routines here, enough good lines and visual action, to make this quite a  pleasant diversion. Of course, it is not Silver Streak, but it is fun, and the last chance to see one of the good comedy teams in films. I particularly enjoyed Wilder's citation, so to speak, of some classic comedy routines (for example, that of Smith and Dale) early in the film, when he fell into his chronic liar persona.I suppose before buying, renting or borrowing this disc, you should ask yourself whether you are going to be in a relaxed, receptive mood or a critical one.

Boy was i right.The yodeling scene drove me absolutely bonkers watching it, i was comtemplating turning it off, never to watch it again. When i watched the therapy session play near the start of the film, (When Richard Pryor came to meet George for the first time.) i really wanted to turn it off. The acting in that scene made me think how bad and WEIRD the acting is. The therapist in that scene should be commited too, he looked like he should be a patient himself.

As mentioned earlier, ""Silver Streak"" ""Stir Crazy"" are top gold for the duo.  ""See No Evil, Hear No Evil"", personally was also funny...it's from the late 80's--the magic is already diminishing.  Nevertheless, still enjoyable.  I love it even though it got panned by critics and reviewers here on Amazon.  I saw that this movie, ""Another You"" also got sad reviews across the board...but figured ""hey, if I liked ""see no evil, hear no evil.."" this might be good also.It wasn't.  Trust me...I had a VERY open mind about this movie.  I was desperately SEARCHING for places to laugh...and unfortunately couldn't find any.  Let me clarify...there are many things that one COULD laugh at...but they didn't make me laugh.  I'm 22 and I suppose the comedy is dated or preferred for an older group (??) but some of the bits just don't work anymore.  Someone here reviewed that the yodeling scene in the movie was funny...I didn't laugh. In fact, i was shocked it went as long as it did.  The part where Richard Pryor fakes playing the saxophone?  A tired and old routine.  A bit like that isn't new...it's old.  Pryor tries to fake his way through a sax solo and fails.  That SHOULD be funny right?  The are many avenues and opportunities for gags in this movie...but their efforts are mediocre--at best.I couldn't wait for the movie to end.  The acting was so fluffy and over the top that, THAT might be the only thing you can laugh at!  The plot is bareable but we're not watching a Wilder/Pryor movie for a plot!  Pyror's swearing is the only consistent comedic input he has in the movie which gets a giggle--not laughs.Sadly, Pryor's medical condition escalates and is visible in the movie.  Facial reactions are not present much, and his overall frame is stiffening.  One would simply guess that it's old age but it distracts you when you're watching the movie.The movie gets a very generous D as a grade.  People who would enjoy this would probably be people who watched it in theatres in 1991 and(for whatever reason) enjoyed watching it again today.  For ones who have never seen it and are younger...doubt you'll enjoy or compare it to the other Pryor/Wilder gems.",2,Another You - The end of something great,1179360000,"05 17, 2007",2007,2250,"[""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'films', 'especially', 'when', 'up', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'Silver', 'Streak', 'Stir', 'Crazy', 'are', 'top', 'gold', 'duo', 'See', 'No', 'Evil', 'Hear', 'No', 'Evil', 'personally', 'was', 'also', 'funny', 'late', '80', 'magic', 'already', 'diminishing', 'Nevertheless', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'love', 'even', 'got', 'panned', 'critics', 'reviewers', 'here', 'Amazon', 'saw', 'movie', 'also', 'got', 'sad', 'reviews', 'board', 'figured', 'hey', 'liked', 'see', 'evil', 'hear', 'evil..', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'also.It', 'was', ""n't"", 'Trust', 'had', 'VERY', 'open', 'mind', 'movie', 'was', 'desperately', 'SEARCHING', 'places', 'laugh', 'unfortunately', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'Let', 'clarify', 'are', 'many', 'things', 'one', 'COULD', 'laugh', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', ""'m"", '22', 'suppose', 'comedy', 'dated', 'preferred', 'older', 'group', 'bits', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'anymore', 'Someone', 'here', 'reviewed', 'yodeling', 'scene', 'movie', 'was', 'funny', 'did', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'fact', 'i', 'was', 'shocked', 'went', 'as', 'long', 'did', 'part', 'where', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'fakes', 'playing', 'saxophone', 'tired', 'old', 'routine', 'bit', ""n't"", 'new', 'old', 'Pryor', 'fake', 'way', 'sax', 'solo', 'fails', 'SHOULD', 'be', 'funny', 'right', 'are', 'many', 'avenues', 'opportunities', 'gags', 'movie', 'efforts', 'are', 'mediocre', 'best.I', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'movie', 'end', 'acting', 'was', 'so', 'fluffy', 'top', 'might', 'be', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'laugh', 'plot', 'bareable', ""'re"", 'not', 'watching', 'Wilder/Pryor', 'movie', 'plot', 'Pyror', 'swearing', 'only', 'consistent', 'comedic', 'input', 'movie', 'giggle', 'not', 'laughs.Sadly', 'Pryor', 'medical', 'condition', 'escalates', 'visible', 'movie', 'Facial', 'reactions', 'are', 'not', 'present', 'much', 'overall', 'frame', 'stiffening', 'One', 'would', 'simply', 'guess', 'old', 'age', 'when', ""'re"", 'watching', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'very', 'generous', 'D', 'grade', 'People', 'who', 'would', 'enjoy', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'people', 'who', 'watched', 'theatres', '1991', 'reason', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'again', 'today', 'ones', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'are', 'younger', 'doubt', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'compare', 'other', 'Pryor/Wilder', 'gems']",Another You VHS
