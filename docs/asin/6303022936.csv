I'm always a sucker for stupid B movie films like this. It's fun and funny in a really stupid way. Andrew Lowery stars as a kid who has the hots for a girl. In an attempt to show off to her, he gets killed by a store robber. He comes back as a zombie and begins to live life as if nothing ever happened. Of course, there are certain body parts that fall off and stuff, but that's to be expected from a rotting corpse. There are a few jokes and gags in here that are genuinely funny, in a sophmoric way. The best come from chacrter actor Austin Pendleton as a nutty doctor. The rest of the cast include : Paul Dooley, Edward Herrmann, Cloris Leachman, and Mary Beth Hurt. It's a juvenile comedy with a somewhat delightful and appealing presence. If your into that sort of thing, then you will probably enjoy this.

Cops are not swift in their authority and uniforms. The jocks are not very intelligent since they only have muscle in their skull. The bullies just get what they deserve, an axe in the head. I don't see how they don't get an Indian in the head of some of the local bigots.But don't think parents are going to be better. They are just infatuated with their dear genial children, sons or daughters, who are the acme of chicken-guano and bull-pie, and these children actually are just that, guano and cow-pie. With whip cream on top and a cherry to crown it off. A la mode and with style.And the doctor is of course a mad scientist who only thinks of one thing: to make money from the dead flesh of the zombie. Money money money. Yum yum yummy. Cosmetic surgery without the surgery. Doesn't it sound fine and attractive? The dead have to collaborate and bring some added value to the living after all. The State could even have a Value Added Tax on the dead. Perfect indeed.School teachers and other school personnel are just what they are a school of cold fish that stink high heavens like rotting salmon in a polluted river. And I will not say what happens to the trout in the lake. Dead fish can also be zombies. But then they do not have fish bones in their bodies, rather perambulating decaying radiations, like in nuclear radiations. Don't touch. It burns.So the poor Dingle who is a dongle in life and a zombie in death will be revived by some miracle worked out by Saint Peter himself after his severe mistake and a fit of anger which should be directed onto himself but is mis-directed onto the poor Johnny. It is not easy to dangle between life and death, between the morgue and the grave, between the insanity of the saints and the sanity of Satan.The film is funny, though of course not as funny as Michael Jackson's rewriting of the Night of the Living Dead. It is true here we have the Prom of the Living Dead mixing with the dead living. That sounds more romantic than terrifying. But it is horrifyingly gross at times and Shakespearian at other times; They even have the balcony scene of Romeo and Juliet revisited for young zombies with decaying muscles. I just wonder where the three weird sisters are?Ah! Ah! Ah!

351237,A2S52Z0Y292L89,6303022936,Kerra,"[0, 0]","This movie was absolutely hallarious! I was about 10 or 11 when I saw this movie for the first time, so it wasn't exactly the way I remember it. But you all know how it is when you see a movie when you are little and remember it being really scary or completely different when you watch it when your older. For some reason I thought that this movie was about a boy who started dating a girl and they fell in love. Some way or another he ended up dying and coming back to life, and his body parts started falling off, lol. And they just wanted to wait until they could go the dance together before he went and crossed over. Well that is not at all how it happend, lol. It is about a boy who has this huge crush on a girl and thought that by being really brave and protecting her from a robber that she would accept his invitation to go to the dance with him. Well in an altercation to him protecting her from the robber he gets shot and dies. Then he comes back to life and for some reason she can't resist him and absoulutely has to go to the dance with him. Well his body parts do start to fall off and for him to last long enough to go to the dance he has to eat living flesh. So, it happened a little differently than I remember, but it was still a great movie and had my sister and I laughing up a storm. Especially since everyone in this town acted like it was totally normal for people to come back from the dead!

351238,A3TMS14RL9Q0R1,6303022936,"K. Sommerfield ""Slasher Studios""","[1, 1]","Growing up I would classify myself as a ""pure"" slasher fan. I didn't enjoy comedy mixed with my horror as I found that more often than not it diluted the effectiveness of the scares. That's not to say that I didn't ever enjoy the comedy-horror subgenre. ""Night of the Creeps"" and ""Return of the Living Dead"" were two of my favorites from the subgenre growing up. Maybe it has something to do with zombies. I never was able to take them very seriously so they seemed to mix well into the comedy format for me. All of this brings me to one of my favorite horror-comedies from the early 90's, the sorely underrated ""My Boyfriend's Back."" Hilarious from beginning to end with some of the driest dark humor to come out of the 90's, the film was a box office bomb on initial release making less than $4 million on a budget of $10 million. With an all star cast (Philip Seymour Hoffman, Matthew McConaughey, Ren&eacute;e Zellweger, and Matthew Fox all appear in small roles) let's dig into this film that deserved to be a hit.The film starts in a flashback as we meet the young Johnny Dingle at the age of 6, he has been in love with beautiful Missy McCloud for as long as he can possibly remember. For a 6 year old, this is a very, very long time. It is Missy's birthday and he plans to give her a heart shaped locket with the pictures of the two of them enclosed. This is the day where he finally is going to get up the courage to tell her how he feels. What do you know...he chickens out and keeps the locket safely tucked away in his bedroom closet. Someday will be the day, right?We flash forward ten years to high school where Johnny is still in love with the still beautiful Missy but Missy has a boyfriend: the typical jerk jock boyfriend played with swarmy perfection by Matthew Fox. Johnny finds out through the grapevine that the two have recently broken up so he decides to make his movie in the most drastic way possible. She works at a convenience store and he plans to have his friend Eddie ""rob"" the place while he heroically saves her. She will fall madly in love with him and they will live happily ever after. The plan doesn't go well and Johnny dies right after Missy says she will go to the prom with him. What's a guy to do? Come back from the dead for his girl of course.This results in some of the most delicious dark comedy I've ever seen in a wide release horror comedy as the town doesn't seem to react much to the fact that Johnny has come back from the dead (well, besides the ones that want to burn him at the stake but...). With a game cast and some off the wall humor, it just puts a smile on my face. I hope it also puts a smile on yours.",5,"True Loves Never Dies in the Hilarious ""My Boyfriend's Back""",1342656000,"07 19, 2012",2012,2664,"['Growing', 'up', 'would', 'classify', 'pure', 'fan', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'comedy', 'mixed', 'horror', 'found', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'diluted', 'effectiveness', 'scares', 'not', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'ever', 'enjoy', 'comedy-horror', 'subgenre', 'Night', 'Creeps', 'Return', 'Living', 'Dead', 'were', 'two', 'favorites', 'subgenre', 'growing', 'up', 'Maybe', 'something', 'do', 'zombies', 'never', 'was', 'able', 'take', 'very', 'seriously', 'seemed', 'mix', 'well', 'comedy', 'format', 'one', 'favorite', 'horror-comedies', 'early', '90', 'sorely', 'underrated', 'Boyfriend', 'Back', 'Hilarious', 'beginning', 'end', 'driest', 'dark', 'humor', 'come', '90', 'film', 'was', 'box', 'office', 'bomb', 'initial', 'release', 'making', 'less', '4', 'million', 'budget', '10', 'million', 'star', 'cast', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'Ren', 'eacute', 'Zellweger', 'Matthew', 'Fox', 'appear', 'small', 'roles', 'let', 'dig', 'film', 'deserved', 'be', 'hit.The', 'film', 'flashback', 'meet', 'young', 'Johnny', 'Dingle', 'age', '6', 'been', 'love', 'beautiful', 'Missy', 'McCloud', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'possibly', 'remember', '6', 'year', 'old', 'very', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'Missy', 'birthday', 'give', 'heart', 'shaped', 'locket', 'pictures', 'two', 'enclosed', 'day', 'where', 'finally', 'going', 'get', 'up', 'courage', 'tell', 'how', 'What', 'do', 'know', 'out', 'locket', 'safely', 'tucked', 'away', 'bedroom', 'closet', 'Someday', 'will', 'be', 'day', 'right', 'flash', 'forward', 'ten', 'years', 'high', 'school', 'where', 'Johnny', 'still', 'love', 'still', 'beautiful', 'Missy', 'Missy', 'boyfriend', 'typical', 'jerk', 'jock', 'boyfriend', 'played', 'swarmy', 'perfection', 'Matthew', 'Fox', 'Johnny', 'out', 'grapevine', 'two', 'have', 'recently', 'broken', 'up', 'so', 'make', 'movie', 'most', 'drastic', 'way', 'possible', 'convenience', 'store', 'have', 'friend', 'Eddie', 'rob', 'place', 'heroically', 'will', 'fall', 'madly', 'love', 'will', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'plan', ""n't"", 'go', 'well', 'Johnny', 'dies', 'right', 'Missy', 'will', 'go', 'prom', 'What', 'guy', 'do', 'Come', 'back', 'dead', 'girl', 'course.This', 'results', 'most', 'delicious', 'dark', 'comedy', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'wide', 'release', 'horror', 'comedy', 'town', ""n't"", 'seem', 'react', 'much', 'fact', 'Johnny', 'come', 'back', 'dead', 'well', 'ones', 'want', 'burn', 'stake', 'game', 'cast', 'off', 'wall', 'humor', 'just', 'smile', 'face', 'hope', 'also', 'smile', 'yours']",My Boyfriend's Back VHS

I saw it several years back (I guess right when it hit cable) and I've loved it ever since. Every other reviewer here seems to claim that it's not Oscar material and blah blah blah. If the only movies you watch are those you think will win awards, you're missing out on many great flicks.You may not like this film, that's obvious. I found it to be hilarious, though, and that's how I tend to judge and review comedy films. The attitudes the characters have to the events in this movie make it exceptionally humorous, especially in the case of the mother. Rent this movie and see if you like it. If you don't, at least you'll have the material to write a truly awful review here.
