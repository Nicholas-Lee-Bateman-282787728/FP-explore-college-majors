1385028,A2EVQ8S7FMLGL,B0044CM7YC,Amazon Customer,"[50, 55]","I really liked the video, partially because I got it at a nice price.  There's three lessons, each an hour long.  They assume familiarity with yoga.  There's very little in terms of correcting common mistakes or explaining how poses work.  They have the feel of a taped yoga class, rather than a cheesy ""yoga abs in 15 minutes"" sort of deal.My definite problem with Rodney Yee is that the difficulty seems a little off.  He does the standard thing where he starts with standing/downward dog poses, then progresses on to ground work.  His standing poses are generally quite easy, he doesn't even specify chaturangas, hold planks for any length, or other steps that are helpful for building strength.  But then on the groundwork, he is weirdly flexible and assumed the viewer is the same, doing forward bends in near-splits and so forth.I'm interested in a ""yoga for athletes"" video for the strength benefits, not because I'm already super-flexible and want to keep at that.  Anyway, everybody should keep their spine erect at all times, particularly strength athletes.  Once he gets started on ground work I'm tempted to cut out the video right thereI found the ""Yoga Burn"" the most challenging, but also a little annoying.  Sequences are done slowly and repeated over and over.  The other videos are pretty similar to each other, but it's nice to have the variety because watching the exact same recorded sequence gets old.",4,A replacement for classes,1314576000,"08 29, 2011",2011,1423,"['really', 'liked', 'video', 'partially', 'got', 'nice', 'price', 'three', 'lessons', 'hour', 'long', 'assume', 'familiarity', 'yoga', 'very', 'little', 'terms', 'correcting', 'common', 'mistakes', 'explaining', 'how', 'poses', 'work', 'have', 'feel', 'taped', 'yoga', 'class', 'rather', 'cheesy', 'yoga', 'abs', '15', 'minutes', 'sort', 'deal.My', 'definite', 'problem', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'difficulty', 'little', 'off', 'standard', 'thing', 'where', 'standing/downward', 'dog', 'poses', 'then', 'ground', 'work', 'standing', 'poses', 'are', 'generally', 'quite', 'easy', ""n't"", 'even', 'specify', 'chaturangas', 'hold', 'planks', 'length', 'other', 'steps', 'are', 'helpful', 'building', 'strength', 'then', 'groundwork', 'weirdly', 'flexible', 'assumed', 'viewer', 'same', 'doing', 'forward', 'near-splits', 'so', 'forth.I', ""'m"", 'interested', 'yoga', 'athletes', 'video', 'strength', 'benefits', 'not', ""'m"", 'already', 'super-flexible', 'want', 'keep', 'Anyway', 'everybody', 'should', 'keep', 'spine', 'erect', 'times', 'particularly', 'strength', 'athletes', 'Once', 'started', 'ground', 'work', ""'m"", 'tempted', 'cut', 'out', 'video', 'right', 'thereI', 'found', 'Yoga', 'Burn', 'most', 'challenging', 'also', 'little', 'annoying', 'Sequences', 'are', 'done', 'slowly', 'repeated', 'over', 'other', 'videos', 'are', 'pretty', 'similar', 'other', 'nice', 'have', 'variety', 'watching', 'exact', 'same', 'recorded', 'sequence', 'old']",Power Yoga Collection: 3 Full-Length Programs

I am new to yoga practice and wanted to go from relaxing yoga to butt kicking yoga. Weight loss is important to me, but the stretching is essential as well due to injuries I am dealing with. In the first 5 minutes of the first workout I was sweating and amazed at how challenging it is.

1385037,A1T6VABQU7RBMA,B0044CM7YC,T. Carr,"[104, 105]","Rodney Yee is one of the best yoga instructors out there. This includes 3 full length 60 minute practices taken directly from 3 previous dvds, all conveniently included on one disc. Rodney Yee doesn't focus too much on the mental/spiritual side of yoga, nor does he only speak of the physical benefits, thereby providing a nice balance that I think would appeal to most all yoga practitioners.His voice is soothing and his cuing excellent, making it easy to flow through the poses and achieve an almost meditative state. I firmly believe all levels could benefit from this dvd, though some prior experience with yoga is recommended. I attached links to the individual workouts included in the disc below, as well as the web address where you could find my more detailed review for each. Here I will just say that each of the 3 practices is unique and different from the others and they are all wonderful.
