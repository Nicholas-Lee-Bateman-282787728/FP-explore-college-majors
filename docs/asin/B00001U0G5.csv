Some of the humor is dated, but most of the well-worn jokes were done here first.There is no nudity, no gore, no bad language (with one exception) and no real violence.I won't spoil why the film has an &quot;R&quot; raiting, but it is one of the better jokes in the movie.  (And terribly tame by today's standards.)The story is silly. There are plot holes hig enough to drive a truck through.  (With big blinking signs pointing to them in some places.) Teenagers die in silly ways for having unauthorized sex. The dysfunctional heroine tries to figure out who is doing it in order to clear her name.  (It always seems like she is in the wrong place at the wrong time.) And wait until you see who gets crowned prom queen.Not a perfect film, but worth getting.

511911,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00001U0G5,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[2, 3]","If you think the horror spoof comedy genre started with Scary Movie and Shriek if You Know What I Did Last Friday the Thirteenth, think again.  Horror was all the rage in the early 1980s (as the introduction to this film points out, all 26 horror movies released during the previous year made a profit), so it comes as no surprise that some filmmaker would come along and try to exploit the genre for laughs (and money) - and so was born Student Bodies.  I know what you're thinking when you see the title - naked girls - but I'm going to have to disappoint you on that score.  Even though the film received an R rating, there's almost nothing R-rated about it - no actual nudity, very little profanity, and only the slightest amount of blood.  Sure, kids keep getting killed for having sex, but none of them actually live long enough to do it.  And the killer uses whatever he can find, so forget about machetes and knives and think eggplant, erasers, and paper clips.A distinctly Halloween-esque opening scene introduces us to The Breather.  Actually, you could say The Breather introduces himself to us because, even though the camera shows us each scene from his perspective, he maintains a fairly constant monologue around all of his heavy breathing.  In this fashion, he gives us a number of the film's funniest lines, such as when he's struggling to climb stairs, stepping in chewing gum, questioning his choice of footwear, or calling in to announce when and where he is going to kill next (using  a rubber chicken to disguise his voice).  We don't know who the killer really is until the end, of course, but there's no shortage of suspects at the local high school.  Don't expect any yellow tape to appear around crime scenes, by the way, because the school conducts its own investigation.  Principal Peters (Joe Talarowski) isn't going to let the murder of several students ruin the biggest school day of the year (due to budget cuts, the school has to have all extracurricular activities such as the big game, the big parade, the prom, etc. on the same day, and today's the day) - not even when a second couple are murdered at the big funeral of the first dead couple.  Instead of cops, Principal Peters calls on a few teachers and a schizophrenic psychologist to name the killer.  Meanwhile, do-gooder Toby (Kristen Riter), who has the bad habit of discovering most of the victims, conducts a secret investigation of her own.  Who could the murderer be?  Principal Peters?  The horse head bookends-obsessed (and constantly scene-stealing) shop teacher Mr. Dumpkin (Joe Flood)?  The seriously addled contortionist of a janitor?  The girl who would do anything to make sure she gets elected prom queen?  Weirdoes abound on this campus, so just about anyone could be The Breather.I should point out the fact that you don't have to be a horror fan to enjoy Student Bodies - you might not recognize the references to films such as Halloween, When a Stranger Calls, or Carrie, but that won't stop you from appreciating all of the comedy on display here.  Don't let the fact that producer Michael Ritchie went the Allen Smithee route in the credits worry you, either.  This movie is almost bursting at the seams with great one-liners.  Not only is Student Bodies a genuinely funny movie, it actually manages to stay consistently funny from start to finish - and all without resorting to the exceedingly raunchy level of similar films today.  It is possible that a few viewers might be offended by a few things here and there (such as the manner in which a blind student and a crippled student are portrayed), but I'd be lying if I said these weren't some of the movie's funniest moments.  If you have a sense of humor and don't adopt an elitist attitude toward dumb jokes, I'm willing to bet you'll find much more satisfaction in Student Bodies than all of the films in the Scary Movie franchise combined.  In this case, the first truly is the best.",5,Hasn't there been enough senseless killing?

This flick is by far the latter.  Is it stupid?  Oh, yeah.  You can actually feel your brain cells corroding as you watch it.  Feels kinda like a soda in your skull.  But it's also funny, funny, funny.  The Breather is one of my favorite movie maniacs, and the two times the film stops to have a brief discussion with the audience on the killer's identity or the film's rating are brilliant.  In a stupid way.  If you thought the Scream movies were really clever, or if you want to know more about what somebody did last summer, then this isn't the movie for you.  If you liked 'Charlie's Angels 2', then not only is this movie not for you, but you need to have yourself put away before you pollute the gene pool.  If, however, you want to put your brain in neutral and take a tour of Wackyland without the use of banned substances, then this budgetless wonder is my recommendation to you.

Last year 26 horror films were released...None of them lost money.""Lest you think we're suffering through the heyday of moronic spoof films (Date Movie, Epic Movie, Scary Movie, Meet the Spartans), consider the early 1980s and the glut of fatuous flicks such as Alfred Sole's Pandemonium, Greydon Clark's Wacko, Howard R. Cohen's Saturday the 14th, or this one, Mickey Rose's Student Bodies.By far the cheapest of the lot, Bodies was written and co-directed by Rose, the onetime writing partner of Woody Allen who helped pen What's Up Tiger Lily?, Bananas, and the classic Take the Money and Run. Any knack for subtlety or humor was sorely lacking by the time Rose wrote this spoof -- the comedy is as broad as a barn and strictly borscht belt.Filled to the brim with bad puns, awkward sight gags, Dr. Pepper product placement, and parodies of then-recent horror films such as Halloween and Friday the 13th, Bodies stars Kristen Riter as Toby the good girl virgin and Matthew Goldsby as Hardy, the nerd with a heart of gold. The pair investigates a string of murders by The Breather (Richard Brando), an unseen killer who wears galoshes and disguises his voice with a rubber chicken. The Breather knocks off ""wild and crazy"" oversexed high school students with obtuse objects such as an eggplant, a chalkboard eraser, and a horse head bookend.Always the mark of quality, Student Bodies was produced by Allen Smithee, this time around taken by Michael Ritchie, who also co-directed.

511937,A29Q1SCC4OCO67,B00001U0G5,mypetconcubine,"[0, 0]","I almost gave up hope this was ever going to DVD, but it's finally here.This movie is funny beyond belief....a crazy comedy. I remember watching this film late one night because there was nothing else on. This is my favorite stupid horror spoof of all time.When Student Bodies first came out in 1981 it was completely unique, no one had ever done a horror spoof before. Hense the original Movie poster proclaiming ""At last The world's first comedy horror movie"".Student Bodies was written and directed by Mickey Rose, who collaborated with Woody Allen on the screenplays for Allen's early films.The film had a completely unknown and still unknown cast *Kristen Riter* Toby Badger, *Matt Goldsby* Hardy, *Richard Brando* The Breather,Student Bodies had a notoriously difficult production and producer Michael Ritchie, Ritchie opted to take his name off the picture, instead using the Director's Guild pseudonym.This movie has become quite popular since it's release on video in the early eighties.This comedy is every teenage horror film you've ever seen from the 70's and 80's and every horror movie cliche is taken to hilarous extremes of laughter. The screams are as frequent as the laughs as a crazy murderer or maybe murderess terrorizes Lamab High.But the senior class is not going to take it lying down most of all Toby Badger...*KRISTEN RITER*. A mousy good girl you know like in all horror films Toby's the virgin. Toby's putting herslef and her beau in some silly positions so she can find out who's ""the breather"". A killer who is murdering her non-viriginal friends with a pair of rubber gloves and garbage bags and other unusal weapons of choice.With help from her boyfriend Hardy...*MATT GOLDSBY*(Student Bodies,Frances) who's the town nerd of sorts who's always there by Toby's side if she needs him. Hardy's trying his best to protect and save Toby. But at the same time trying to protect and save himself.Toby and Hardy are Ducking such lethal weapons such as paper clips, blackboard erasers and horse-head bookends, they set about trying to find the mysterious ""Breather"" and other things that go bump in the night.No one is safe from the crazy twists and turns of the looney plot, and a madcap twist of an ending. No one is Safe least of all the student bodies themselves. Football games, pep rallies, parades and senior proms provide background for a movie that leaves no horror movie cliche unexplored.This movie is Rated R which actually I think is a joke onto itself because there is only slight nudity, little Gore, there's only a few bad words said in the entire movie, some lewds jokes but that's the best parts.This movie is actually quite tame considering all the raunchy teen movies of the 80's and 90's that will follow it.

Basically Scary Movie before there ever was Scary Movie, Student Bodies gleefully spoofs the slasher flicks that began achieving mega-popularity in the late 70's/early 80's, and features Richard ""Detective John Munch"" Belzer (here credited as Richard Brando) as the voice of the heavy breathing killer that picks off teens ready to get it on.  Full of some nice visual gags and even funnier dialogue, Student Bodies just comes off as way too tame considering the kind of films it is spoofing.  You won't find any nudity, gore, or barely any foul language in Student Bodies, which is disappointing in itself.  Not to mention that it loses steam by the time it begins to wind down, with some just plain unfunny moments as well.  Still, Student Bodies is fun for a while, and deserves a place in slasher and spoof movie history for being a bit ahead of it's time.

Legend Films has teamed with Paramount to help shorten that list a bit. The title that I was most happy to see being released on DVD for the first time is 1982 slasher comedy Student Bodies.This comedy/horror flick is like a cross between CARRIE & AIRPLANE and predates the Scary Movie  franchise by 19 years.STUDENT BODIES centers around the students and staff of Lamab High, as one by one they are picked off by The Breather.The Breather is a galoshes wearing killer with a bizzare choice of weapons and apparently a bad case of asthma. The movie starts out on Friday the 13th and jumps right into the action as promiscuous teens are picked off with everything from paper clips to horse head bookends and including an eggplant.There is an on screen death count just to help viewers keep track of the action and also a nifty arrow that helps viewers realize when a door is left unlocked or a window opened.My favorite moment of the show though, hands down is the breakaway to a news desk where the movie s R rating is discussed and then earned. The cast is full of campy actors who specialize in cheese and do great in keeping the bad jokes and sight gags flowing throughout the movie.There is one character named Malbert who is honestly a human cartoon. The guy is probably 7 foot tall and has to weigh less than 100 pounds. He contorts his limbs throughout the movie in ways that had me doing a double take as it didn t seem humanly possible. In the credits the actor is listed as The Stick so I have no idea of his real name.If you like Scary Movie (Sydney!) then you will love this, the grandfather of horror comedies. If you are a child of the 80 s then go out and pick this one up, I guarantee you will have fun. This movie, much like the Zucker Brothers classic Airplane! is full of great quotes &#34;Did you just hang up on me?&#34; and there is definitely unlimited re-watch-ability.The release is a bit bare of special features, although the original trailer is included and is fun to watch as well. The SRP of this movie is $14.99 and is worth every penny. I definitely recommend you go out and purchase this one, you will not regret it. --Friday Night Frights on SwitchPlanet.comThis killer comedy is the original teenage parody horror film taken to the extreme! The screams are as frequent as the laughs as a crazed, perverted heavy-breathing murderer terrorizes Lamab High with a series of mysterious deaths. Everyone is a suspect and no one is safe from the hilarious twists and turns as Breather terrorizes and kills sex-starved couples.When the body count rises, one student attempts to solve the mystery and instead finds herself a suspect.
