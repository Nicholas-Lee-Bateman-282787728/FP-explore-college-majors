I have the first 6 'series' (series is Australian for a season)I bought as they became available from Australia and got the whole region free DVD player etc. I recall when it was shown on our Direct TV on the WE channel, but it was so cut up with commercials and ""edited"" for US TV, we couldn't watch it! Now that the entire show is available at Amazon in region 2, it's a great show that we highly recommend! With this season we thought that they couldn't keep the action going, but they did. Something that US shows can't seem to do to well is bring in new characters, have old ones killed off or leave the show and still keep the show alive. Can't wait for season 8 which was the LAST season and the show is now gone from TV in Australia.",5,McLeod's Daughters: Season 7,1236124800,"03 4, 2009",2009,855,"['wife', 'fell', 'love', 'series', 'when', 'first', 'started', 'watch', 'Canadian', 'satellite', 'dish', 'have', 'first', '6', ""'series"", 'series', 'Australian', 'season', 'bought', 'became', 'available', 'Australia', 'got', 'whole', 'region', 'free', 'DVD', 'player', 'etc', 'recall', 'when', 'was', 'shown', 'Direct', 'TV', 'WE', 'channel', 'was', 'so', 'cut', 'up', 'commercials', 'edited', 'US', 'TV', 'could', ""n't"", 'watch', 'Now', 'entire', 'show', 'available', 'Amazon', 'region', '2', 'great', 'show', 'highly', 'recommend', 'season', 'thought', 'could', ""n't"", 'keep', 'action', 'going', 'did', 'Something', 'US', 'shows', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'do', 'well', 'bring', 'new', 'characters', 'have', 'old', 'ones', 'killed', 'off', 'leave', 'show', 'still', 'keep', 'show', 'alive', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'season', '8', 'was', 'LAST', 'season', 'show', 'now', 'gone', 'TV', 'Australia']",McLeod's Daughters: Season 7
