The lead role is played by Leonardo DiCaprio who does a great job playing a deep undercover CIA spy in the middle east. The plot is rather complex and I don't think I could summarize it easily. The focus is on middle east terrorism and a couple of groups making plans. The movie was expansively photographed with a rich selection of locations. Since the story jumps from country to country (Jordan, Turkey, USA, etc) they did a nice job of giving a look to each place. There are some action scenes which are good.

1174138,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B001C4CI8A,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 1]","That was one of the big disappointments I had with `Body of Lies'; it came across rather cheap.  The film seemed to borrow heavily from a lot of other films and brought nearly nothing new to the table.  I have to admit, I wasn't expecting a lot.  I read the novel a while back, when this film was still in the making, and I had some major issues with it.  I found it far too clich&eacute;d and generic and lazy, especially the second half where everything just seems to take a nose dive into ridiculousness.The film followed suit.I think I have some other issues with the film though.  Sadly, it just doesn't work very well.  The storyline, while easily followed, is hard to really digest.  It just doesn't make a lot of sense, and like I said, the second half just catapults into preposterousness.  I don't want to get into my complaints too heavily, because they would give away far too much of the film, but then again maybe I should just throw up a SPOILERS disclaimer and let it all out!  I'll say this, the fact that Hani continues to work with Farris is highly unlikely and the fact that everything, in the end, becomes all about a piece of tail that Farris can't keep his eyes off of is the same thing that made me seethe at the novel.  I mean, how clich&eacute;d it is to take a perfectly fine premise for a thriller and turn it into a soap opera gone wrong.And despite Crowe's excellent performance, Ed Hoffman is almost an offensive stereotype.The acting is pretty strong, outside of Leonardo DiCaprio, who just cannot handle accent work very well.  He comes off stiff and unrealistic here, especially when he struggles to act `angry' and use his accent.  His character development is laughable and in the end this winds up being one of his worst performances (yes, it's up there with that `Blood Diamond' fiasco).  The rest of the cast, especially Mark Strong and Russell Crowe, work wonders with what they are given.  It's funny, they actually sell two characters who are very poorly written yet essential to the films progression, so Ridley Scott should be thanking his lucky stars for that bit of screen casting.  Strong, I predict, is going to be very big this decade.  I've seen him in just a few things, but he has major presence.  Crowe, as we all know, is a brilliant actor.  I will say, it was nice to see him tackle a character that is very different from his usual work.  He was almost comic relief here, but in a very serious kind of way (Hoffman may make jokes, but don't take him lightly) and he nails it.""Don't have kids.""Oh yeah, and his accent work was miles ahead of whatever it was that DiCaprio was trying to pull off.In the end, `Body of Lies' only manages to bring mild thrills to the table, with a `happy' ending that just doesn't cut it.  It is a clich&eacute; ridden mess that seems clunky and unfocused in times and that suffers from a blatantly bad lead performance.  It's not a complete waste of time, but it isn't a film that deserves multiple viewings.You can find much better.",3,Cheap thrills...,1276473600,"06 14, 2010",2010,3019,"['was', 'one', 'big', 'disappointments', 'had', 'Body', 'Lies', 'came', 'rather', 'cheap', 'film', 'seemed', 'borrow', 'heavily', 'lot', 'other', 'films', 'brought', 'nearly', 'nothing', 'new', 'table', 'have', 'admit', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'lot', 'read', 'novel', 'while', 'back', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'still', 'making', 'had', 'major', 'issues', 'found', 'far', 'too', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'generic', 'lazy', 'especially', 'second', 'half', 'where', 'everything', 'just', 'take', 'nose', 'dive', 'ridiculousness.The', 'film', 'followed', 'suit.I', 'think', 'have', 'other', 'issues', 'film', 'Sadly', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'very', 'well', 'storyline', 'easily', 'followed', 'hard', 'really', 'digest', 'just', ""n't"", 'make', 'lot', 'sense', 'said', 'second', 'half', 'just', 'catapults', 'preposterousness', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'complaints', 'too', 'heavily', 'would', 'give', 'away', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'then', 'again', 'maybe', 'should', 'just', 'throw', 'up', 'SPOILERS', 'disclaimer', 'let', ""'ll"", 'say', 'fact', 'Hani', 'work', 'Farris', 'highly', 'unlikely', 'fact', 'everything', 'end', 'piece', 'tail', 'Farris', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'eyes', 'same', 'thing', 'made', 'seethe', 'novel', 'mean', 'how', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'take', 'perfectly', 'fine', 'premise', 'thriller', 'turn', 'soap', 'opera', 'gone', 'wrong.And', 'Crowe', 'excellent', 'performance', 'Ed', 'Hoffman', 'almost', 'offensive', 'stereotype.The', 'acting', 'pretty', 'strong', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'who', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'handle', 'accent', 'work', 'very', 'well', 'stiff', 'unrealistic', 'here', 'especially', 'when', 'act', 'angry', 'use', 'accent', 'character', 'development', 'laughable', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'one', 'worst', 'performances', 'yes', 'up', 'there', 'Blood', 'Diamond', 'fiasco', 'rest', 'cast', 'especially', 'Mark', 'Strong', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'work', 'wonders', 'what', 'are', 'given', 'funny', 'actually', 'sell', 'two', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'very', 'poorly', 'written', 'yet', 'essential', 'films', 'progression', 'so', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'should', 'be', 'thanking', 'lucky', 'stars', 'bit', 'screen', 'casting', 'Strong', 'predict', 'going', 'be', 'very', 'big', 'decade', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'just', 'few', 'things', 'major', 'presence', 'Crowe', 'know', 'brilliant', 'actor', 'will', 'say', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'tackle', 'character', 'very', 'different', 'usual', 'work', 'was', 'almost', 'comic', 'relief', 'here', 'very', 'serious', 'kind', 'way', 'Hoffman', 'may', 'make', 'jokes', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'lightly', 'Do', ""n't"", 'have', 'kids', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'accent', 'work', 'was', 'miles', 'ahead', 'whatever', 'was', 'DiCaprio', 'was', 'trying', 'pull', 'end', 'Body', 'Lies', 'only', 'bring', 'mild', 'thrills', 'table', 'happy', 'ending', 'just', ""n't"", 'cut', 'clich', 'eacute', 'mess', 'clunky', 'unfocused', 'times', 'suffers', 'blatantly', 'bad', 'lead', 'performance', 'not', 'complete', 'waste', 'time', ""n't"", 'film', 'multiple', 'viewings.You', 'can', 'find', 'much', 'better']",Body of Lies

1174140,ARA48345JZPZR,B001C4CI8A,Archmaker,"[1, 2]","I found much to like in this modern espionage thriller set smack dab in the middle of the struggle of our times with high tech spies battling 7th Century jihadists who have found and exploited the weaknesses of that same technology, bending it to their own ends.It's a Ridley Scott film, which means superb craftsmanship, and has an excellent cast with DiCaprio and Crowe in the lead, but I think both are trumped by Mark Strong's Hani, the sophisticated and cultured head of Jordanian Intelligence, who delivers the film's best moments, as well as its sub-theme that technology cannot replace human intelligence in the struggle against jihadists.The technology presented is stunning if it is truly that advanced.  But the real espionage war is presented as down and dirty in the trenches.  There are some side trips with DiCaprio's interest in a young Muslim nurse, but these are thinly developed and mostly it is a fast paced action thriller, with some nice details.I was troubled by the Russell Crowe character.  While duplicity and bureaucratic back-stabbing are certainly part of life in the CIA as in any large organization, a boss that constantly undercuts and double crosses you would not inspire much confidence and loyalty, and I don't think would rise to such a position of power.  Sure, he might do dirt to rivals in the office, but to constantly lie to and subvert the field operatives that risk their lives for you seems an unlikely path for career advancement. No one would work for you.  But what do I know?All in all, a gritty and fast paced entertainment.

Leo once again shows he is an incredible actor and one that seems to be overlooked.  Though the movie follows DiCaprio's character throughout the Middle East in search of a certain Al Qaeda leader which eventually leads to a violent meeting between the two in an ""undisclosed"" area there is also a side story for his character.  This side story involves a possible love interest and if he reeally wants to continue working for the CIA.The movie is slow moving at times but you're always watching the screen because of Leo.  You also get to see Russell Crowe shine once again, although his character may not be the most well-liked character as Leonardo's CIA boss.I recommend this movie.

DiCaprio and Crowe were excellent together in this CIA thriller! The movie is set in Jordan, where DiCaprio is the man on the ground, hunting a radical cleric.Leo DiCaprio was on top of his game as undercover CIA agent Roger Ferris, his roles are always believable and in my opinion he's one of the best actors making movies right now. His last several movies have been outstanding: ""Blood Diamond"" (06), ""The Departed"" (06) and ""Catch Me If You Can"" (02).Russell Crowe plays Ed Hoffman, DiCaprio's (Ferris) CIA eyes and ears in Langley, Virginia. The role seemed a little out of place for Crowe, but he played it really well. Love him or hate him, Russell Crowe has only made blockbusters since 2000 - ""American Gangster"" (07), ""3:10 to Yuma"" (07), ""Cinderella Man"" (05), ""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"" (03), ""A Beautiful Mind"" (01) and ""Gladiator"" (00).The movie moves along at a fast paced, is thrilling and has a few twists and turns.If you liked ""The Kingdom"", ""Vantage Point"" and / or ""Charlie Wilson's War"", you'll love ""Body of Lies""~",5,Excellent...,1241308800,"05 3, 2009",2009,1139,"['missed', 'Body', 'Lies', 'theaters', 'finally', 'watched', 'dvd', 'Excellent', 'DiCaprio', 'Crowe', 'were', 'excellent', 'together', 'CIA', 'thriller', 'movie', 'set', 'Jordan', 'where', 'DiCaprio', 'man', 'ground', 'hunting', 'radical', 'cleric.Leo', 'DiCaprio', 'was', 'top', 'game', 'undercover', 'CIA', 'agent', 'Roger', 'Ferris', 'roles', 'are', 'always', 'believable', 'opinion', 'one', 'best', 'actors', 'making', 'movies', 'right', 'now', 'last', 'several', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'outstanding', 'Blood', 'Diamond', '06', 'Departed', '06', 'Catch', 'Me', 'Can', '02', '.Russell', 'Crowe', 'Ed', 'Hoffman', 'DiCaprio', 'Ferris', 'CIA', 'eyes', 'ears', 'Langley', 'Virginia', 'role', 'seemed', 'little', 'place', 'Crowe', 'played', 'really', 'well', 'Love', 'hate', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'only', 'made', 'blockbusters', '2000', 'American', 'Gangster', '07', '3:10', 'Yuma', '07', 'Cinderella', 'Man', '05', 'Master', 'Commander', 'Far', 'Side', 'World', '03', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', '01', 'Gladiator', '00', '.The', 'movie', 'moves', 'along', 'fast', 'paced', 'thrilling', 'few', 'twists', 'turns.If', 'liked', 'Kingdom', 'Vantage', 'Point', '/', 'Charlie', 'Wilson', 'War', ""'ll"", 'love', 'Body', 'Lies', '~']",Body of Lies

1174154,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001C4CI8A,Chris Pandolfi,"[1, 4]","What's disappointing about Ridely Scott's ""Body of Lies"" is that I felt nothing for it. It tells a story that should be engaging, but somehow, I wasn't engaged--I felt detached and apathetic, as if I had been watching an instructional video instead of a spy thriller. This is in no way a statement against Scott, Leonardo DiCaprio, or Russell Crowe, who have been, are now, and most likely always will be very talented people; I suspect the problems with this movie have more to do with the story, which has all the elements but just can't seem to go beyond what we've come to expect. Based on the novel by ""Washington Post"" columnist David Ignatius, ""Body of Lies"" is derivative and lethargic, taking far too long to make a point that's already been made numerous times. I kept waiting for something to pique my interest, something that would compel me to invest in both the story and the characters. Sadly, I was left dangling.It also wasn't fun to see DiCaprio's character--a CIA operative named Roger Ferris--endure so much physical abuse. Attack dogs bite his legs, requiring a painful series of rabies injections. His transport vehicle is destroyed by a missile, which not only scars his face, but also leaves bone shards embedded in his arm. He even becomes familiar with the working end of a hammer during an uncomfortable torture scene, and I won't describe that any further. By the end of the film, Ferris looks more like a botched medical experiment than an operative for the United States. His mission seemed straightforward enough: Enter Iraq and track down a terrorist named Al Salim. Of course, missions like this are never straightforward. Too much is at stake for that to be possible, especially since unknown terrorists are responsible for bombings in Manchester, England and Amsterdam, Netherlands. Capturing Al Salim would hopefully strike a serious blow to Middle Eastern extremists.After recovering from an attack, Ferris travels to the country of Jordan to share intelligence with Hani Salaam (Mark Strong), the head of the General Intelligence Department (GID). Hani makes it clear that he will help Ferris on the condition that no lies are told. Does that seem a little obvious to you? Why would someone in his position have to demand the truth? Isn't the truth something we all want from the people we interact with?As all this is being established, we discover that Ferris' supervisor, Ed Hoffman (Crowe), is constantly keeping track of him with the help of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle. What a strange character; he always has an earpiece on, and he interacts with his family while simultaneously communicating with Ferris. His soft voice masks a stubborn, manipulative personality, which I guess stems from his intolerance of terrorism. Unlike Ferris, he feels that negotiating will solve absolutely nothing, and he gets his point across by continuously going behind Ferris' back. Example: After ordering Ferris to inspect a Jordanian safehouse run by Al Salim, Hoffman orders a Middle Eastern operative to meet a terrorist residing there. Ferris was never told about this, which only makes things worse when the operative blows his cover. I'm really not sure how we're supposed to feel about Hoffman; it's good he knows that terrorists are rejecting technology and are therefore becoming harder to track down, but it's also unnerving that he would willingly subject Ferris to such people. A better performance from Crowe would have helped. His delivery is so lax, it was surprising DiCaprio didn't fall asleep listening to him.While in Jordan, Ferris meets a nurse named Aisha (Golshifteh Farahani), who he gradually falls in love with. While there was nothing particularly wrong with the subplot in and of itself, I'm hard pressed to say that it was necessary for the film as a whole. It felt tacked on, superfluous, and unimportant, although I'm sure the intention was for something more significant. Maybe this isn't the kind of story that needs a romance, least of all an interracial romance. Obviously, I can't say that removing it altogether would affect the story one way or another. However, I have the feeling that more significant ideas were better suited for ""Body of Lies,"" ideas that would have allowed it to be more meaningful.Unfortunately, all we're left with is routine material. You experience neither highs nor lows watching this movie--there's nothing but a quiet sense of indifference. I wasn't excited or moved by any of it, not even when Ferris and Hoffman stage a terror attack in an attempt to lure Al Salim out of hiding. The film crawls its way from point A to point B, and by the time its message is delivered, we're too bored to take any interest. It doesn't help that the message has been given before, even in the most recent films about Middle Eastern terrorism. ""Body of Lies"" is one of Ridley Scott's weakest films, failing to engage the audience as a suspenseful spy thriller. This isn't to say that its heart wasn't in the right place. I could tell that an effort was being made, and I was pleased to see that Leonardo DiCaprio turned out yet another fine performance. It's too bad that even he couldn't make me care about what was going on; you'd think that a believable character would be able to stir up something rather than instilling a complete lack of concern. This also applies to Ridley Scott, one of today's most talented directors.",3,The War on Terror Drones On and On,1224547200,"10 21, 2008",2008,5406,"['What', 'disappointing', 'Ridely', 'Scott',

1174162,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B001C4CI8A,DanD,"[1, 2]","A lot of movies make espionage out to be a glamorous, tuxedoed affair.  BODY OF LIES tells the tale as it is: A world of mistrust and violence, where one minute you're negotiating, and the next you're picking your friend's bone fragments out of your arm.  Roger Ferris finds out the hard way, as he worms his way into a terrorist conspiracy and risks his life--and more--for a cause that he is beginning to question.  His boss back home, Ed Hoffman, offers Ferris advice while eating cereal and taking his kids to school.  Ferris is on his own; his friends are his enemies, and his enemies are everywhere.DiCaprio is perfect for the role; a true chameleon, he can slip into any character and bring them to life.  Russell Crowe is also well-suited for his role; he gained a bunch of weight, and is in fact almost unrecognizable.  He brings out the irony of his character, while also waxing poetic that makes something resembling sense.  But as good as DiCaprio and Crowe are (and they are very good, near the top of their game), the true scene stealer here is Mark Strong, who plays the Jordanian head of intelligence.  He is charming and sinister, who makes the word ""dear"" sound like a prophecy of doom.  He is technically a good guy, but we have to suspend our typical definitions of the word ""good.""And that is the main strength of this film: It seems very, very real.  Nobody is a saint, and nobody is a sinner; they are all human, all with motivations and causes, just like in the real world the movie accurately reflects.  The violence is never gratuitous, and often almost too realistic; the torture scene near the end is cringe-inducing, and the explosions--there are several--are all believable, none of that typical Hollywood lights-and-sound show.  BODY OF LIES may not be perfect--there is an unnecessary romantic subplot, and viewers must always question certain facts that are presented to them on the silver screen--but it is a realistic, engaging spy thriller that poses quite a few questions, and lets the viewer judge for himself.

1174163,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B001C4CI8A,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[27, 29]","Ridley Scott delivers again in a long line of excellent films.Blade Runner (Five-Disc Complete Collector's Edition) [Blu-ray],Alien (The Director's Cut),Thelma & Louise (Special Edition), andBlack Hawk Downto name some of the more influential films he has directed.The common theme, repeated again in Body of Lies, people's struggle to do the right thing, to fight for good. Scott also has a particular film style that he uses to great advantage in this film. This story in other hands would not be nearly as powerful. The pacing in Body of Lies is very similar to Blade Runner.This is essentially a series of three short stories, or a play in three acts. Each act starts out calmly, building to a huge climax, and then there is the resolution. The common thread through each act is Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe. It would appear at first that this is going to be a very complicated film, mideastern conflict films or news articles are usually incredibly complex and mind numbing. However, Scott has managed to use the appropriate names and complicated cultures, but keeps the film focused on the critical story line - Roger Ferris (DiCaprio). In fact, the film is very simple and easy to follow.In the first two acts, DiCaprio was believeable with his beard, dirty clothes, and speaking arabic languages. His character was a bit less believeable in the third act and as he started the relationship with Aisha. There were a few moments where the film wandered a bit. It was especially when Roger drove himself in a vehicle. That may sound strange, but it was emphasized several times, ""do want to ride in the front or back?"", that he was not driving. There was a loss of focus with him at the wheel.Russell Crowe plays an overweight, southern boy, CIA director, named Ed Hoffman. He is simply perfect through the whole film. Never a misstep. Crowe has an amazing range in his acting ability.The story is somewhat like 24, terriorist chases, a relationship with the pretty woman, trust me I know whay I'm doing, etc. But Body of Lies moves much farther ahead, and makes a stronger more believeable message than 24.From a production standpoint, Ridley Scott is a master. This reviewer noted only a few missteps. One sadly obvious one was a pan to follow Roger walking across a hallway late in the film. Roger walks way out of focus and then back in - the camera movement was too radical and quick to keep focus. It sadly was not on purpose. Otherwise, everything else was spot on perfect considering the film genre.This is definately an R rated film. There is a fairly brutal scene at the end, and some punishing (this was the term used in the film) earlier on. There's enough language and violence to land appropriately in this category. Probably not a film for younger viewers at all. There is no nudity.The DVD contains no bonus features at all. Simply the movie, sound choices, and chapters. But that's the way it should be, the focus was on the quality of the transfer and DVD. Ridley Scott is actually a bigger fan of releasing different versions later on, instead of bonus features.This was an exciting, easy to follow and understand film from start to finish.

K,"[0, 0]","BODY OF LIES***  Out of 5Release Date- October 10th, 2008Running Time- 128-MinutesRating- RScreenplay- William MonahanDirector- Ridley ScottStarring- Leonardo DiCaprio, Russell Crowe, Mark Strong, Ali Suliman, Golshifteh FarahaniI was quite excited for Body of Lies due to the talent that was involved. While I'm not a huge fan of Russell Crowe he is a very talented actor and in my opinion Leonardo DiCaprio is one of the very best if not the best actor working today and of course with Ridley Scott directing that also got my interest. But while I did like Body of Lies I have to admit I did find this to be a pretty big letdown. Maybe my expectations were too high, but when all was said and done Body of Lies was good, but it could have been a lot more.The screenplay by William Monahan is well written and plotted, but there just seems to be something missing. The characters I just couldn't make a connection with and for me that was the biggest problem. The characters are interesting, but never given much depth and while again the script was well written in general my only problem was the lack of depth to the characters; the plot is strong, but I also felt at times certain plot points weren't set up enough. Again the script was good, but just lacking in certain areas.The strongest parts of the script for me was when Roger Ferris (DiCaprio) has lunch with Aisha (Golshifteh Farahani) and her family; in these scenes is where there is a little more depth to the characters and I think more scenes like that would have greatly helped the movie.Director Ridley Scott does a fine job with the pacing; Body of Lies moves at a solid pace and there's never really a slow moment and the action scenes are quite well done. It is possible to have a movie well written, directed and acted, but yet not fully work. Body of Lies was a good movie, but was lacking the extra something that separates good movies from great movies. Scott though gets the job done and I think it was more of the script than the directing. The final act though was excellent and tension filled and in these scenes is where Ridley Scott really succeeds.Russell Crowe as Ed Hoffman delivers a solid performance, but he wasn't used to his full potential and while again it was a good performance he didn't show how talented he is. The biggest selling point for me was Leonardo DiCaprio who I honestly feel will go down as the greatest actor of his generation his talents as an actor is awe inspiring, but like Crowe, Leo isn't allowed to show his full range. Leo's performance was no doubt another winner in a career, which is shaping up to be legendary. The body of work he's done in the past few years is truly amazing, but when you have an actor like Leo you need to take full advantage and again Leo delivers another excellent performance, but he just wasn't used to his fullest potential. Iranian actress Golshifteh Farahani in her American film debut was the standout and nearly steals the show.Overall Body of Lies was a solid, but flawed movie; while the movie was good like I said I just felt as if it was missing that extra something that separates good movies from great movies. But with all that said Body of Lies is a good movie, but could have been more.The Blu-ray is loaded with extra features that cover pretty much every aspect of the film and they are also in HD. The picture quality is brilliant and the sound is great. The 2-disc DVD is about the same price as the BD, but for the extra couple of dollars I'd highly recommend the Blu-ray",4,Good if not a little lackluster considering the talent involved,1235692800,"02 27, 2009",2009,3534,"['BODY', 'OF', 'LIES***', 'Out', '5Release', 'Date-', 'October', '10th', '2008Running', 'Time-', '128-MinutesRating-', 'RScreenplay-', 'William', 'MonahanDirector-', 'Ridley', 'ScottStarring-', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Mark', 'Strong', 'Ali', 'Suliman', 'Golshifteh', 'FarahaniI', 'was', 'quite', 'excited', 'Body', 'Lies', 'due', 'talent', 'was', 'involved', ""'m"", 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'very', 'talented', 'actor', 'opinion', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'not', 'best', 'actor', 'working', 'today', 'course', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'directing', 'also', 'got', 'interest', 'did', 'Body', 'Lies', 'have', 'admit', 'did', 'find', 'be', 'pretty', 'big', 'letdown', 'Maybe', 'expectations', 'were', 'too', 'high', 'when', 'was', 'said', 'done', 'Body', 'Lies', 'was', 'good', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'more.The', 'screenplay', 'William', 'Monahan', 'well', 'written', 'plotted', 'there', 'just', 'be', 'something', 'missing', 'characters', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'connection', 'was', 'biggest', 'problem', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'never', 'given', 'much', 'depth', 'while', 'again', 'script', 'was', 'well', 'written', 'general', 'only', 'problem', 'was', 'lack', 'depth', 'characters', 'plot', 'strong', 'also', 'felt', 'times', 'certain', 'plot', 'points', 'were', ""n't"", 'set', 'up', 'enough', 'Again', 'script', 'was', 'good', 'just', 'lacking', 'certain', 'areas.The', 'strongest', 'parts', 'script', 'was', 'when', 'Roger', 'Ferris', 'DiCaprio', 'lunch', 'Aisha', 'Golshifteh', 'Farahani', 'family', 'scenes', 'where', 'little', 'more', 'depth', 'characters', 'think', 'more', 'scenes', 'would', 'have', 'greatly', 'helped', 'movie.Director', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'fine', 'job', 'pacing', 'Body', 'Lies', 'solid', 'pace', 'never', 'really', 'slow', 'moment', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'quite', 'well', 'done', 'possible', 'have', 'movie', 'well', 'written', 'directed', 'acted', 'yet', 'not', 'fully', 'work', 'Body', 'Lies', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'was', 'lacking', 'extra', 'something', 'good', 'movies', 'great', 'movies', 'Scott', 'job', 'done', 'think', 'was', 'more', 'script', 'directing', 'final', 'act', 'was', 'excellent', 'tension', 'filled', 'scenes', 'where', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'really', 'succeeds.Russell', 'Crowe', 'Ed', 'Hoffman', 'solid', 'performance', 'was', ""n't"", 'used', 'full', 'potential', 'again', 'was', 'good', 'performance', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'how', 'talented', 'biggest', 'selling', 'point', 'was', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'who', 'honestly', 'feel', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'greatest', 'actor', 'generation', 'talents', 'actor', 'awe', 'inspiring', 'Crowe', 'Leo', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'show', 'full', 'range', 'Leo', 'performance', 'was', 'doubt', 'winner', 'career', 'shaping', 'up', 'be', 'legendary', 'body', 'work', 'done', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'truly', 'amazing', 'when', 'have', 'actor', 'Leo', 'need', 'take', 'full', 'advantage', 'again', 'Leo', 'excellent', 'performance', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'used', 'fullest', 'potential', 'Iranian', 'actress', 'Golshifteh', 'Farahani', 'American', 'film', 'debut', 'was', 'standout', 'nearly', 'steals', 'show.Overall', 'Body', 'Lies', 'was', 'solid', 'flawed', 'movie', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'said', 'just', 'felt', 'was', 'missing', 'extra', 'something', 'good', 'movies', 'great', 'movies', 'said', 'Body', 'Lies', 'good', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more.The', 'Blu-ray', 'loaded', 'extra', 'features', 'cover', 'pretty', 'much', 'aspect', 'film', 'are', 'also', 'HD', 'picture', 'quality', 'brilliant', 'sound', 'great', '2-disc', 'DVD', 'same', 'price', 'BD', 'extra', 'couple', 'dollars', ""'d"", 'highly', 'recommend', 'Blu-ray']",Body of Lies

David Ignatius is a columnist for the Washington Post on international affairs. On the side, he is one of the best writers of spy fiction writing currently: he is, on a par with Robert Littell and Charles McCarry and, at most, a half step behind John Le Carre. Lies unfolds in the modern Middle East, Iraq and then Jordan, with sidesteps to Turkey and Dubai. (In the first scene in Dubai, one of our favorite buildings in Dubai was in the background, the Hotel Dusit.) Di Caprio plays a young CIA field agent. Crowe is his aging fat-around-the-middle handler and superior back in Washington, a man who cannot stop double-dealing, even with his own agents. Their objective is to entrap the head of an effective and up till then subterranean terrorist agency. If they cut off the head of the movement, they hope, the body will die. The movie plays out in a cascade of episodes, many of them grisly and all effective. Shot alternately in closeup (handheld cameras) and long shot (the view from overhead spy planes), they show the viewer how difficult it is to operate in an alien terrain where the enemies don't play by the rules. (The terrorists don't use cell phones or email so there's nothing to track.) In desperation, Di Caprio sets up a sting operation: he creates a false backtrail that insinuates that there is a second jihadist group out there drawing attention away from the master terrorist that Di Caprio and Crowe seek to capture. Di Caprio's sting leads to the death of an innocent and to Di Caprio's capture and torture - it's rough stuff, all of it, but it has the smell of truth to it.

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[3, 3]","Anytime Ridley Scott is behind the camera the viewer can be assured there will be gratuitous violence presented in a most convincing manner; if you're not squirming uncomfortably you aren't watching a Ridley Scott film.  And such is very much the case with Scott's latest offering, BODY OF LIES, a taut, gripping, white-knuckle thriller set in the turbulent Middle East.  Although the general story revolves around a CIA operative in Jordan trying to find a mastermind terrorist, the overall theme has to do with trust--in particular, the lack thereof between not only the CIA and other foreign intelligence services, but between operatives of the CIA itself.I'm going to hate myself in the morning, but I am rapidly becoming a very big fan of Leonardo DiCaprio.  His role as CIA agent Roger Ferris--a role that takes him to several unpleasant locations and exposes him to constant danger--is gritty, believable, and nuanced as only DiCaprio can mould a character.  He's frustrated by his CIA higher-ups, including superior Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe), because of the constant roadblocks put in his path that prevents him from doing his job.  And DiCaprio's Ferris also demonstrates that all this living on the edge is wearing him razor thin--and the thread's about to snap.  Meanwhile Crowe is fun to watch as the chubby, aloof, almost disinterested ""eye in the sky"" following Ferris's movements on the ground; I got a kick out of him talking violent strategy with DiCaprio's character via bluetooth while he's loading his kids in the back of his station wagon.  Priceless.But Mark Strong as Jordanian intelligence czar Hani Salaam steals the show; he's a cold, calculating, scheming professional, and he's not hampered by the human rights issues of his American counterparts.  And in the end he gets the ultimate ""Gotcha!"" moment--an ending in a showdown with a room full of terrorists and a scene not for the faint of heart.  Less than five stars as the plot meanders needlessly at times, yet if it's a heart-pounding espionage thriller you're looking for BODY OF LIES will not disappoint.--D.

1174174,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,B001C4CI8A,Doug Park,"[0, 0]","BODY OF LIES takes a no-flinching satirical view of the whole game of covert intelligence gathering in the Middle East during the Iraqi War years. DiCaprio is okay as point-man Roger Ferris; Crowe gives a very convincing performance as Hoffman, Ferris's control guy back in the States. Golshifteh Farahani is particularly good as Aisha, the half-Iranian Palestinian refugee nurse that Ferris falls for in Amman. The whole conflict of the film is the CIA's attempts to catch Al-Saleem, a bin Ladenish terrorist mastermind whose followers are committing suicide bombings all over Europe. Quite violent, as you can imagine, but it's not completely dominated by blow-'em-up scenes.I like the way that BODY OF LIES portrays the CIA ops: Hard-edged, cynical, without any real lives of their own, but not the completely soulless spooks that they are in certain other books and films. Plot-wise, it's not entirely predictable, but there's something missing in the way of really surprising complications. Some good themes: The way the amoral Hoffman has to keep reminding himself and everyone else, ""We are at war,"" that no one on either side is innocent, etc. The parallels it shows between Hoffman and Al-Saleem, Ferris and the suicide bombers, are quite acute. Still, there's not much here that hasn't been better-done elsewhere.I found BODY OF LIES watchable but pretty unfulfilling. Many people obviously like this film, but many others are obviously finding it to be 128 very draggy minutes, and I can see why. It's obviously dated by everything that's happened in the six years since it was released, and was probably a better film then than it is now.",3,"""Your friends dress like your enemies, and your enemies dress like your friends""",1400112000,"05 15, 2014",2014,1650,"['BODY', 'OF', 'LIES', 'no-flinching', 'satirical', 'view', 'whole', 'game', 'covert', 'intelligence', 'gathering', 'Middle', 'East', 'Iraqi', 'War', 'years', 'DiCaprio', 'okay', 'point-man', 'Roger', 'Ferris', 'Crowe', 'very', 'convincing', 'performance', 'Hoffman', 'Ferris', 'control', 'guy', 'back', 'States', 'Golshifteh', 'Farahani', 'particularly', 'good', 'Aisha', 'half-Iranian', 'Palestinian', 'refugee', 'nurse', 'Ferris', 'Amman', 'whole', 'conflict', 'film', 'CIA', 'attempts', 'catch', 'Al-Saleem', 'bin', 'Ladenish', 'terrorist', 'mastermind', 'followers', 'are', 'committing', 'suicide', 'bombings', 'Europe', 'Quite', 'violent', 'can', 'imagine', 'not', 'completely', 'dominated', ""blow-'em-up"", 'scenes.I', 'way', 'BODY', 'OF', 'LIES', 'CIA', 'ops', 'Hard-edged', 'cynical', 'real', 'lives', 'own', 'not', 'completely', 'soulless', 'spooks', 'are', 'certain', 'other', 'books', 'films', 'Plot-wise', 'not', 'entirely', 'predictable', 'something', 'missing', 'way', 'really', 'surprising', 'complications', 'good', 'themes', 'way', 'amoral', 'Hoffman', 'keep', 'reminding', 'everyone', 'else', 'are', 'war', 'one', 'side', 'innocent', 'etc', 'parallels', 'Hoffman', 'Al-Saleem', 'Ferris', 'suicide', 'bombers', 'are', 'quite', 'acute', 'Still', 'not', 'much', 'here', ""n't"", 'been', 'better-done', 'elsewhere.I', 'found', 'BODY', 'OF', 'LIES', 'watchable', 'pretty', 'unfulfilling', 'Many', 'people', 'obviously', 'film', 'many', 'others', 'are', 'obviously', 'finding', 'be', '128', 'very', 'draggy', 'minutes', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'obviously', 'dated', 'everything', 'happened', 'six', 'years', 'was', 'released', 'was', 'probably', 'better', 'film', 'then', 'now']",Body of Lies

There is no more Iron Curtain (so labelled first by Winston Churchill in 1946). This is Arab Terrorism vs. the CIA and its Arab allies and enemies. Nobody is to be trusted. Not only hidden political sympathies but also personal ambition can  turn an apparent friend into an enemy, and enemy to friend. This is one fine picture of the many that are coming off the assembly line to fit the new circumstances, circumstances which can never fully be understood by those involved with them much less the casual onlooker. I don't have anything resembling an understanding of the multiple political, religious, social, economic revolutions rocking the Muslim world, a vast territory stretching from the shores of Spain (once under Moorish domination) to the islands of Indonesia. So I can enjoy, as I did this movie, this Entertainment (in Graham Greene's word) without trying to judge how close it comes to any reality. It possesses a fiction's reality, one that can be accepted for the duration of the movie, and that is all that matters. Aside from a tight script and exotic (though not romantic) settings,  it does have budding love which serves to create the coda for the film. I probably have seen the two stars in a few things but have no memory of what they were;  here, they contribute an admirable quality to the proceedings. Possibly, Crowe overdoes his role of the cynical ""Chief"" under whom Agent DiCaprio serves. I think, however, it was what the film's creators wanted to say with that role. Supporting players were quite good, with the young woman playing DiCaprio's friend conveying an air of experienced innocence which was fitting to the role.Action and drama fans should take to the movie, the squeamish will only have a few minutes of brutality, for the rest, it is the Old Spy Game.

1174177,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B001C4CI8A,Ed Uyeshima,"[3, 6]","The craftsmanship behind director Ridley Scott's 2008 convulsive political thriller is impressive, but having acts of terrorism drive an intentionally labyrinth plot reveals how they impede the story structurally, an insurmountable barrier that screenwriter William Monahan (The Departed) can't seem to overcome. The movie's first half is all the more bewildering for all the double-crosses and cover-ups that serve to set up the central situation. Based on Washington Post columnist David Ignatius' popular2007 novel, the movie focuses on embedded CIA operative Roger Ferris who is on an undercover assignment to hunt an Al-Qaeda terrorist leader named Al-Saleem. Ferris is not entirely alone as he is connected via cell phone with his stateside boss Ed Hoffman, who is the head of the CIA's Near East division and directs Ferris toward life-threatening tasks in a most nonchalant manner from his upscale suburban home.The plot's impetus is driven by the elusive Al-Saleem's unblinking series of suicide bombings in Europe in response to the invasion by US and UK troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. The movie gets more interesting when Ferris decides to work with Jordanian intelligence director Hani Salaam, an erudite, enigmatic figure who is well entrenched in the Middle East militia and appears to take a page from Mario Puzo'sThe Godfatherwhen it comes to loyalty and betrayal. Of course, it's a matter of course that Ferris' loyalty is tested when an elaborate plan is hatched to create a bogus competing terrorist group and use an unwitting Dubai architect as the head. The other complicating factor is that Ferris has fallen for pretty Iranian nurse Aisha when he gets treated for possible rabies at a clinic. It becomes inevitable that she also becomes a pawn in the political intrigue. Scott paints his canvas with a lot of graphic violence from large-scale bombings to more intimate acts of torture.All of the external elements are fitting, but they can't seem to masquerade the convoluted and often clich&eacute;-ridden plot at the film's core. A solid cast goes a long way to compensate for the plot holes. As Ferris, Leonardo DiCaprio applies his trademark wiry energy to an intensely compelling performance that could have shown a bit more variety. Adding fifty belly-stretching pounds to his frame, Russell Crowe, Scott's favorite leading man (Gladiator,American Gangster,A Good Year), plays the Arkansan Hoffman as a scene-stealing character part. The irony is that the Australian actor's Southern accent is more convincing than DiCaprio's. Their antagonistic interplay, played out mostly on the phone, is rather predictably developed. Fetching Iranian actress Golshifteh Farahani provides gratefully calm relief to the ongoing mayhem as Aisha, although her character comes across as a mere plot device. There is a nicely fractious dinner table scene with Ferris and her judgmental older sister, although the movie plays down the more human-size hostilities in favor of the pyrotechnics.As Hani, Mark Strong (Sunshine,Stardust) leaves the most vivid impression of the cast but for the most old-fashioned of cinematic reasons - he plays what could be a villainous figure as a suave, mysterious man of honor who is completely on top of his job, an intentional counterpoint, at least physically, to Crowe's slovenly Hoffman. The film's resolution defies credibility, but it finally becomes clear that Monahan is not interested in exposing the factors that have driven the Middle East political maelstrom into acts of escalating terrorism.

It was one of those Middle Eastern things (Iraq centered) with a lot of intrigue, death and destruction and all deeply involved with the CIA. Leonardo DiCaprio played an agent situated where the action was whereas Russell Crowe, his main CIA contact, lived back in Fat City (CIA headquarters in Washington) in comfort with his wife and kids. They contacted back and forth through airline flights and ultra-high-end media connections.It was an intriguing movie, and gave interesting insights to the CIA capabilities, if there is any truth at all to the movie. It also went a long way in explaining the size of the CIA budget. The movie flited around geographically from place to place to the point of confusion, although seeing various parts of the Middle East was interesting in itself. The language, particularly associated with DiCaprio, was hampered with the excessive use of F-speak, which added zero to the story and give the film a low-class patina. Be prepared for a certain amount of brutality. A romantic touch was present, but absolutely minimal. Death and destruction were everywhere, including some really spectacular explosions. The movie must have had a high-end budget. There's a lot of action, action, action and boredom never set in, well perhaps a little here and there. The story was not particularly interesting, nor believable, nor well done, however. The script could have used a lot of extra effort.

Russell Crowe's cynical CIA bureaucrat ""remotely controls"" Leonardo DiCaprio's field agent.  The tension between the clinical Crowe, who pushes buttons, and the in the flesh DeCaprio, who pulls triggers, captures the dichotomy of the foot-soldier in the field and his office bureaucrat commander.Refreshingly, the ""natives"" are depicted sympathetically.  Jordanian Intelligence Chief Hani is a suave, sophisticated operator.  Even some of the terrorist suspects are shown as full human beings rather than Dick Cheney-George W.

Certainly, inter-religious relationships happen everywhere.

This definitely fits the last two mentioned qualities. The plot is impeccably well-written, and keeps developing very well throughout.By no surprise, DiCaprio delivers another winning performance here as the young CIA field agent who is given authority within a short time period to do what he wants to get what his superior wants. Here he is cocky, brave and smart, exactly what his character should be. He is the true lead of the film because without him, the story and film would be meaningless. His solid performance also makes the film better. DiCaprio is now recognizable as a character who completely immerses himself in the role. His ""Leo-the-pretty-boy"" days are long gone.Ridley Scott's regular Crowe takes a back seat here, to be DiCaprio's supervisor. Crowe delivers the best performance here. From his Arkansas accent to his leniency at handling somewhat drastic situations, Crowe steals almost every scene he's in. It's good, really, because it makes his character slimy yet interesting. Although his role is understated and underused a bit, it also makes his character cautious.On top of that the cinematography and editing are careful and effective. This shows the Arab culture in a neutral light at certain parts, and actually features spoken Arabic, in nice amounts, which I would say should earn it recognition(in addition to all else I've mentioned in this review). I would say that this is a thriller-drama, with action elements... do not watch it expecting constant car-chases or shootings, albeit it is surely intense. It brings up several well-stated and solid points, for and against several sides, and offers food for thought. There is near-constant language, and it is always moderate or more. Also, there is a lot of violence and a little sheer brutality, and it is not for the faint of heart.",4,"This is the world we are living in, whether we like it or not.",1253145600,"09 17, 2009",2009,1941,"['Ridley', 'Scott', 'usually', 'one', 'can', 'depend', 'make', 'good', 'sometimes', 'fantastic', 'film', ""'ll"", 'mostly', 'be', 'well-done', 'definitely', 'last', 'two', 'mentioned', 'qualities', 'plot', 'impeccably', 'well-written', 'developing', 'very', 'well', 'throughout.By', 'surprise', 'DiCaprio', 'winning', 'performance', 'here', 'young', 'CIA', 'field', 'agent', 'who', 'given', 'authority', 'short', 'time', 'period', 'do', 'what', 'get', 'what', 'superior', 'Here', 'cocky', 'brave', 'smart', 'exactly', 'what', 'character', 'should', 'be', 'true', 'lead', 'film', 'story', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'meaningless', 'solid', 'performance', 'also', 'film', 'better', 'DiCaprio', 'now', 'recognizable', 'character', 'who', 'completely', 'role', 'Leo-the-pretty-boy', 'days', 'are', 'long', 'gone.Ridley', 'Scott', 'regular', 'Crowe', 'back', 'seat', 'here', 'be', 'DiCaprio', 'supervisor', 'Crowe', 'best', 'performance', 'here', 'Arkansas', 'accent', 'leniency', 'handling', 'somewhat', 'drastic', 'situations', 'Crowe', 'almost', 'scene', 'good', 'really', 'character', 'slimy', 'yet', 'interesting', 'role', 'understated', 'underused', 'bit', 'also', 'character', 'cautious.On', 'top', 'cinematography', 'editing', 'are', 'careful', 'effective', 'Arab', 'culture', 'neutral', 'light', 'certain', 'parts', 'actually', 'features', 'spoken', 'Arabic', 'nice', 'amounts', 'would', 'say', 'should', 'earn', 'recognition', 'addition', 'else', ""'ve"", 'mentioned', 'review', 'would', 'say', 'thriller-drama', 'action', 'elements', 'do', 'not', 'watch', 'expecting', 'constant', 'car-chases', 'shootings', 'surely', 'intense', 'up', 'several', 'well-stated', 'solid', 'points', 'several', 'sides', 'food', 'thought', 'near-constant', 'language', 'always', 'moderate', 'more', 'Also', 'lot', 'violence', 'little', 'sheer', 'brutality', 'not', 'faint', 'heart']",Body of Lies

It is as if we are on the ground with the front line of offence and intelligence in the War on Terror.DiCaprio at one point asks a Muslim about his hatred for the Crusaders.  What is poinant about that is that few movies and news stories use that word, which extremists use to stir up anger at the West.  Where Scotts 'Blackhaw Down' focused on a battle and was more of macro view of a battle and a micro view of the fighters, Body of Lies is an even closer micro look from a day to day, individual level of what he sees as the War on Terror.Crowe has a southern twang, gained weight for this role and looks like he was having fun mocking an uncaring character.  DiCaprio is very involved and you get the feeling he is in this work for all the right reasons.I really enjoyed the interplay between DiCaprio and the Jordanians and Crowe.

1174207,A3M6RVUVZOQZLB,B001C4CI8A,"Judy K. Polhemus ""Book Collector""","[2, 4]","""Body of Lies"" is a tantalizing film, a microcosm of the war on terrorism anywhere, any time, to anyone. Leonardo DiCaprio is magnificent as Roger Ferris, CIA operative extraordinaire in the Middle East, in this case seeking the most dangerous leader of the most dangerous cell.The most revealing line is made by the head of the Jordanian secret police. Before he agrees to work with Ferris in locating this cell leader, he tells him: ""Do not lie to me."" So, at the still point of this film lies truth: What is it? Does it exist? Can a man's word be trusted?The viewer learns that the war on terrorism thwarts clear sight, black washes the brain, and adds chaos and confusion at every step. If there is a truth, it is ephemeral. Russell Crow, as head of operations situated at Langley thousands of miles away, adds to the confusion and chaos. Is his word good? Does he contribute to the Body of Lies?Director Ridley Scott's bottom line is that there can be no trust or truth in the war on terrorism. Methods used in pre-terrorist wars are not effective in the Middle East.Except in the age-old story of love. Ferris begins a lovely and honest relationship with a half-Iranian nurse, a modern woman steeped in traditional Islamic values. A fluent speaker of Arabic, Ferris can fit into the Middle East milieu. Much like Hemingway's Lt. Henry inA Farewell To Arms, Ferris finds a pocket of truth, of love amidst the chaos of war. This addition to the film is a stroke of genius by Scott to show that, even amidst the ugliness of clandestine, often cruel operations of war, life continues its natural flow.

1174208,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B001C4CI8A,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[5, 5]","Following the previous 2008 entry (which was Don Cheadle's average at best thriller, ""Traitor"") into the ever-expanding sub-genre of movies focused either directly or indirectly upon the ongoing War on Terror is Ridley Scott's latest Russell Crowe collaboration, ""Body of Lies"". As so many of these types of films have proven over the last couple of years, audiences don't really want to pay to watch a fictionalized account of a conflict, or something related to it, that they can watch for free on their televisions. But, does ""Body of Lies"" manage to side-step this major obstacle that many of its predecessors have fallen prey to, making this one of the rare exceptions, such as ""The Kingdom"" that actually manages to entertain, rather than simply remind us all (unnecessarily, by the way) of what's going on over there?""Body of Lies"" is a widespread tale of political intrigue and espionage that follows CIA agent Roger Ferris (Leonardo DiCaprio), as he and his boss, Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe), follow the trail of a deadly terrorist leader throughout the Middle East.Written by screenwriter William Monahan (""The Departed""), the story for ""Body of Lies"" works very well during the first half of the film. Monahan keeps the plot moving along at a very comfortable pace that doesn't rush the story or allow it to become confusing. He gives the audience time to process the information being presented to them, for a moment, before moving on to the next piece of the puzzle (something that other films like this should maybe take note of.) When the story is focused on the espionage and politics of conducting the war from the perspective of those actually doing the legwork the film works extremely well, and is very entertaining; however, approximately halfway through the movie the story hits a massive snag that it never seems to fully recover from.The snag is a romantic plot development that feels tacked on to appease the female members of the audience who may not be as into the spy stuff that has dominated the majority of the film thus far. I'm not against there being any kind of romance in these films, but this one in particular felt unnecessary and frankly, hard to believe. I mean, Ferris (DiCaprio) is an undercover agent working essentially behind enemy lines, and yet he never really stops to think that perhaps starting a relationship while taking on such high risk assignments might be a bad idea? Give me a break. I will give William Monahan some credit though, because he did still manage to give me some surprises in the latter half of the movie, even though the story's focus and overall tone seemed to have shifted due to the romance. While the twists were somewhat surprising, the plot points leading up to them in the second hour were far too predictable, and at times frustrating when you stop to think that the first hour was very well crafted and top of the line by comparison. What I wish could be done is have William Monahan go back and re-write the last half of the script, completely removing the uninteresting romantic angle, and just focus on the tension-filled action and intrigue that comprised the far superior first half of the film. Had the film worked out that way, then it would have become the best of its sub-genre; instead of being just barely above average.To director Ridley Scott's (""American Gangster"") credit, even though the film's story stumbles along in the final half, he does manage to keep things interesting thanks in no small part to his fast-paced, kinetically charged style of directing. The use of the handheld camera was a smart choice, allowing the audience a sense that they are right in the middle of all the action; therefore keeping them interested and involved to an extent. It was a very wise move on the director's part, and one that most likely kept the movie from being completely derailed by a much weaker secondary storyline that become the primary near the end of the film.Even when this film began to stumble around, stars Leonardo DiCaprio (""The Departed"") and Russell Crowe (""Gladiator"") continued to lend their best efforts to keep the quality of the film elevated as much as possible. DiCaprio continues to impress me as an actor of great range, depth, and talent with his recent crop of dramatic work. Back when he first became a huge star thanks to the extremely overrated mega blockbuster ""Titanic"", I thought he was only alright, but not the kind of star that would really have any kind of staying power. However, after his remarkable performance in ""The Aviator"", followed by ""The Departed"", I am being forced to change my opinion regarding his talents. With Russell Crowe I didn't really know much of his work prior to the smash hit ""Gladiator"", but since then he has consistently remained one of the best actors of his generation, a testament which he has proven true time and again with many classic roles in films, such as: ""Cinderella Man"", ""A Beautiful Mind"", and ""American Gangster"".DiCaprio's character of Roger Ferris is a man who is very complicated, and apparently extremely contradictory in his motivations and sense of duty. On one hand he appears unwavering, cold, and calculated towards his duty to protect his country and its interests, which at times calls for rather extreme measures to be taken; however, on the other hand, he conveys a sense of regret for some of his actions and questions whether he is doing the right thing. It is this duality that makes his character appear interesting and more human, yet also makes one wonder about how consistently he has been written. For example, there is an event that occurs in the film which was set in motion by Ferris, yet when completed and some repercussions are dealt, he quickly flounders on whether on not what he did was right and/or necessary (even though at the time he felt it was), and even attempts to pass the buck onto his boss. This type of floundering began to feel distracting, and coincidentally began occurring in the latter half of the film, when Monahan's screenplay was falling apart for other reasons.As for Russell Crowe's performance as the conniving, opportunistic, and morally questionable Ed Hoffman, it is a very different kind of character than many of his more memorable ones from films past. Just as he had done for ""The Insider"" and ""A Beautiful Mind"", Crowe portrays a man noticeably older and grayer than he, and even appeared to add a few extra pounds to ""fill out"" the character. Even with Crowe's charismatic performance and dedication to the role, I just don't believe that this will be one of his most revered performances of his acclaimed career. In my opinion I believe Crowe's performance did partially suffer from the fact that most of his time onscreen was spent talking on the phone. While plenty of phone conversations have made for some truly exciting and scintillating moments in movie history, I don't believe a character should be on the phone almost the entire time, it just feels distant and impersonal to the audience.What started out as a really solid espionage thriller set around the ongoing War on Terror, began to collapse onto itself when an unnecessary romantic plot development caused the film to stumble throughout the latter half of the story.""Body of Lies"" is rated R for violence and language.",3,Great Movie Derailed by Inferior Sub-plot...,1236297600,"03 6,

1174209,A26X2TG93OTXVU,B001C4CI8A,Justin Heath,"[61, 66]","You really have to admire Ridley Scott's moxie.Even though the 70-year-old director has long established himself as one of Hollywood's best and most durable directors; having helmed some of the most entertaining films of all time, in virtually every genre (including sci-fi classics like Alien and Blade Runner); and having been nominated no less than three times for the Best Director Oscar (Thelma & Louise, Gladiator, Black Hawk Down), to decide to take on theme that has produced exactly zero blockbusters thus far - the Middle East and terrorism - takes an incredible amount of chutzpah.But it does help if you have the help of two of the biggest actors in Hollywood at the moment, those being Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe (who has worked with Scott on two previous films, Gladiator and A Good Year). It's ironic to think that the last time these two actors shared the screen was back in 1995, with the clich&eacute;d-but-entertaining oater The Quick and the Dead. Of course, at the time, Crowe was a complete unknown and DiCaprio was a 21-year-old newcomer with only a couple of notable titles under his belt. But oh, how that's all changed now.It's not easy to describe the plot of Body of Lies without giving too much away. DiCaprio plays CIA operative Roger Ferris, who is trying to flush out a terrorist leader named Al-Saleem in Jordan. He gets his orders from Ed Hoffman (Crowe), a man for whom results are the only satisfactory outcome, delivered with a fair amount of arrogance and a cocky Southern drawl. Ed plays the situation like a kid playing a video game, and has the resources to change the rules anytime he feels like it, dispensing his orders from his office, from his backyard, from his daughter's soccer game, for Pete's sake! This, of course, infuriates Ferris to no end, because he is the one who is in the trenches, chasing the bad guys, dodging bullets, ducking explosions, and procuring the badly-needed intelligence that Hoffman needs. Ferris is also trying to build a productive working relationship with the head of Jordanian Intelligence, Hani Salaam (Mark Strong), a relationship that is made even more tenuous by Hoffman's double-dealings and hidden agendas.There are so many ways that Scott could have screwed this up. A lesser director might have chosen to ramp up the action, sacrificing intelligence for entertainment. A lesser director could have taken this story of espionage and twisted it into a convoluted and indecipherable Gordian knot. A lesser director would have gotten less convincing performances from his lead actors.But Ridley Scott is not a lesser director. Though the plot is indeed complex, with many layers and sub-layers, deceit and treachery, Scott never lets you lose sight of the overall picture. He tells a solid, wonderfully entertaining story, without the need to drive home its message with sledgehammer subtlety (after all, very few things are black and white). And most of all, he gets electric performances from Crowe and DiCaprio, whose symbiotic relationship with a thinly-veiled veneer of mutual contempt is a pleasure to watch.I don't know if Body of Lies will end up breaking through the barrier that every movie in this genre couldn't; but for what it's worth, I hope it does.

DiCaprio's performance is outstanding. You completely forget who he is and become immersed as him as a C.I.A. agent who is undercover. This is quite an acting job considering that he is the furthest thing from that. He has the grizzled appearance of someone undercover and his scenes are so strong and commanding that he doesn't have that baby boy aspect to him that I've seen in other of his pictures. His was an Oscar worthy performance.There is the eye in the sky tracking DiCaprio by camera from above as he goes about his seemingly rouge missions for the C.I.A. Russell Crowe plays the older C.I.A. family man who is in contact with Ferris (DiCaprio) as he walks the minefield that is intelligence gathering in the middle east. Crowe is absorbed in his daily life in America and seemingly is oblivious to the hardships and deadly consequences that Ferris is facing. This is an understated role for Crowe who also very good performance. He does not look at all like that same man who played The Gladiator. And I think this is the most relaxed character I've seen him play yet.This film was expertly directed by Ridley Scott to the point that at times I felt as if I were there. You can almost feel the sand in your lungs and the stink of death and open air markets as you feast your eyes on this gem.Although I'm not typically an action movie man this one reeled me in because you really didn't know what was next around the corner. The action scenes are great, by the way, even though that's not why I pick movies to watch.This is a great movie and if you like the actors, director, and genre of this film then it is a definite for you to watch.I give it all five stars and will watch it again.Kevin W.

This is how the story goes: A CIA operative, Roger Ferris, uncovers a lead on a major terrorist leader suspected to be operating out of Jordan. When Ferris devises a plan to infiltrate his network, he must first win the backing of cunning CIA veteran Ed Hoffman and the collegial, but perhaps suspect, head of Jordanian intelligence. Although ostensibly his allies, Ferris questions how far he can really trust these men without putting his entire operation--and his life--on the line.The cast led by Academy Award Nominee Leonardo DiCaprio (as Roger Ferris) & Academy Award Winner Russell Crowe (as Ed Hoffman) is excellent!

Black Hawk Down is probably the greatest war action movie ever FOR ME, so expectations were high for this one. Scott always seems to combine plausible, well thought out and executed stories with great action and Body of Lies is right there, maybe a notch or two below his best stuff, but still very entertaining. The topical plot weaved an interesting story with twists and turns and was a believable slice of CIA operations in the middle east. I was at first a  little put off by the sort of mini 'plots within plots' way DiCaprio's character went from one mission to the next..it seemed a bit disappointing to know the entire movie wasn't about a singular blockbuster CIA plot/plan ,etc.. but everything does eventually tie in , sort of , to Jordanian intelligence bailing him out in the end.

From Alien to Blade Runner to Gladiator to American Gangster, Scott's dynamic visual flair has always been something that has seperated him from other directors of his ilk. Body of Lies is no different, and stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Roger Ferris, a CIA specialist attempting to infiltrate a major terrorist leader in the Middle East. His boss is Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe), whose double dealings and side operations threaten to blow Ferris' cover as he descends deeper and deeper into the Islamic underworld, in particular his dealings with Hani (Mark Strong) which could make or break the situation at hand. Always compelling, Body of Lies works thanks to The Departed scribe William Monahan's crackling screenplay and DiCaprio's electric performance. Crowe and Strong are great as well, but the film's only real flaw is that it doesn't always feel as if Scott's heart is in it all the way. While Body of Lies does bear his distinction of visual mastery, there's just too many moments of being dragged along by the occasional muddled story and plot.

The plot has a lot of potential, but the end result is one that you're left going ""WTF did I just watch???"".Look, this movie is not bad. It has a few cool scenes and well-choreographed action.

Despite their double billing, DiCaprio and Crowe rarely appear on screen together, making DiCaprio the default star of the picture.  He gives one of his finest performances as a man thoroughly dedicated to the cause he is fighting for but deeply cognizant of the fact that much of what he is required to do in the course of his job will wind up robbing him of a certain percentage of his humanity after all is said and done.  Crowe as the cynical boss and, even more impressively, Mark Strong as a high official in the Jordanian government offer superlative support.As directed by Ridley Scott (from a screenplay by William Monahan based on a novel by David Ignatius), ""Body of Lies"" benefits from engaging dialogue, exciting action sequences and razor-sharp editing.

There is no doubt that as DiCaprio ages and develops character in his face and experience in his craft his performances have gone from competent to outstanding.  In spite of the torture, crashes, and explosions this movie actually had some slow spots and I found myself looking at my watch.  Nevertheless it is entertaining and it makes some excellent points by pointing out the many issues and ambiguities in the middle east politics.  I think few Americans have read the Koran or have any real knowledge of middle eastern history or politics but this film does touch on several very key points and shows both sides of some very complicated issues -- hence my review title of ambiguous.  The terrorist bad guy quotes the Koran to justify his position relative to murder and terrorism but is rebutted by DiCaprio who also quotes from the Koran.  But the Crowe character also points out that the devout Muslim is charged with killing all infidels and so concludes there are no innocents -- thus justifying the killing of the unwitting Muslim Pawn.  The plight of the Palestinians is hinted at but not explored.  Crowe plays a jaded, arrogant, and cynical CIA agent.  This part is exaggerated I think to make the point that in general Americans are terribly ignorant of other cultures -- especially the Islamic culture. The film also points out the superior American technology is useful but cannot be substituted for truly understanding how the Islamic Culture operates.  Of course there were some illogical parts to the film.  We see Muslim women without head scarves and being seen in public with a man not related to them.  Then we have DiCaprio prancing around the Middle East where he would stand out and would only lack the American Flag to identify him as an American.  On a final note I must ask -- does Crowe ever take a bath or shave?  He always looks like a hygenic disaster.

He is one of dozens of manufactured stars in this Walmarty age, the result of a conspiracy between Hollywood agent and producer types to Manchurian Candidate us into unhealthy disregard for DiCaprio's straight-out-of-drama-club talent.  Agonizingly, it worked on quite a few people, and the occasional fluke, such as his charming turn in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"", gave maddening rise to hope that he could, indeed, be the star we hallucinated he was.  (""Leonardo DiCaprio is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most remarkable actor I've ever known in my life."")  When he got shot in the face in ""The Departed,"" though, I was torn -- I had been waiting to see such a moment with him (or Tom Cruise, or Will Smith, or the Jonas Brothers) most of my life, yet I could also see him now doing more than just showing up on set, babbling lines, and squinting.  Could he, indeed, be a bonafide actor?  Could I finally forgive him for ""Titanic"" and ""The Man in the Iron Mask""?  Well, I watched ""Body of Lies"" with optimism that DiCaprio might bring something worth two hours of my life to the screen.  The good news is that he did.  In fact, this is one of DiCaprio's better performances (which on one hand isn't saying much, but on the other suggests that after 30 or 40 films, he might finally be getting the hang of the acting thing).  I wish I could say the same for Russell Crowe, a far more talented actor who seems relegated here to looking sinisterly paunchy, as though on an evil quest for his next breakfast burrito.  It helps that he has an evil wardrobe courtesy of JCPenney.  The problem with ""Body of Lies"" really isn't either actor, nor anyone else in a competent cast, but a script that wants to be John LeCarre when it's barely John Grisham -- mumbo-jumbo CIA dirty dealings in the Mideast.  Ridley Scott, whose films frequently sacrifice narrative depth for what seem increasingly less impressive visuals, gets mileage out of a torture scene, but the rest of the film is like outtakes from ""The Constant Gardener.""  It's worth checking out from the library, but plan on stretching viewings out over a couple of nights, as you will probably want to pause the film to attend to such urgencies as walking the dog or defrosting the refrigerator.  One very bright spot is the stunning Golshifteh Farahani, who shines in every scene she is in and transports us back to a time when the movie industry looked for loveliness rather than marketability in female leads.",3,So-So Movie but Good Performances . . .

I will not be redundant so my review is only on the quality of the transfer to Blu Ray.  I bought the single disc Blu Ray.Video Transfer:  I was surprised at how clean a transfer to Blu Ray the video was.  There was no artifacting or aliasing to be seen anywhere and no noticeable or distracting grain that I could see.  The Mbps rate generally averaged between the high teens and the mid twenties.  Color grading produced a somewhat desaturated effect.  This type of color grading is very common in movies concerning the mid East as if the mid East is devoid of color which it is not but that appears to be the American perception.  Also untrue is that the desert is always a warm, golden look as it is presented in this movie.  Also, not true but that is the color grading of this transfer.  Details in the video remain easily delineated even in the darker and shadow areas.Audio: The audio is a lossless Dolby True HD and produced clear and  precise pronunciation of dialogue.  Volume levels are very good.  Most audio is across the front stage with some decent panning across the front sides and a couple of instances of panning from rear to front,  However, the rear channels generally are not used much more than ambience.  Some discreet channeling, again, mostly across the front stage.  Some sub usage but not a whole lot.  If you like the movie, the blu ray is a good one to have but, again, if you already have it in SD DVD, not sure how much of a difference you will find.Extras include some finished scenes that were deleted and could have easily been included in an extended edition. One of these deleted scenes is an slightly altered ending that would have done well to be included.  Other extras are commentary and story points that I haven't looked at.Since I do not have it on SD DVD, I do not know of the differences between the two formats but I am sure contrast has been boosted a touch and improvement made and if you do not have the SD DVD than surely, the Blu Ray is the way to go.All my reviews focus solely on the quality of the transfers to Blu Ray of both video and audio and I do hope that this review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase decisions and that I am on the correct path with this type of review.Thanks for reading.",4,Body of Lies on Blu Ray,1366848000,"04 25, 2013",2013,2363,"['So', 'many', 'have', 'offered', 'opinions', 'movie', 'provided', 'summaries', 'critiques', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'redundant', 'review', 'only', 'quality', 'transfer', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'bought', 'single', 'disc', 'Blu', 'Ray.Video', 'Transfer', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'clean', 'transfer', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'video', 'was', 'was', 'artifacting', 'aliasing', 'be', 'seen', 'anywhere', 'noticeable', 'distracting', 'grain', 'could', 'see', 'Mbps', 'rate', 'generally', 'averaged', 'high', 'teens', 'mid', 'twenties', 'Color', 'grading', 'produced', 'somewhat', 'desaturated', 'effect', 'type', 'color', 'grading', 'very', 'common', 'movies', 'concerning', 'mid', 'East', 'mid', 'East', 'devoid', 'color', 'not', 'be', 'American', 'perception', 'Also', 'untrue', 'desert', 'always', 'warm', 'golden', 'look', 'presented', 'movie', 'Also', 'not', 'true', 'color', 'grading', 'transfer', 'Details', 'video', 'remain', 'easily', 'delineated', 'even', 'darker', 'shadow', 'areas.Audio', 'audio', 'lossless', 'Dolby', 'True', 'HD', 'produced', 'clear', 'precise', 'pronunciation', 'dialogue', 'Volume', 'levels', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'Most', 'audio', 'front', 'stage', 'decent', 'panning', 'front', 'sides', 'couple', 'instances', 'panning', 'rear', 'front', 'However', 'rear', 'channels', 'generally', 'are', 'not', 'used', 'much', 'more', 'ambience', 'discreet', 'channeling', 'again', 'mostly', 'front', 'stage', 'sub', 'usage', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'like', 'movie', 'blu', 'ray', 'good', 'one', 'have', 'again', 'already', 'have', 'SD', 'DVD', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'much', 'difference', 'will', 'find.Extras', 'include', 'finished', 'scenes', 'were', 'deleted', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'included', 'extended', 'edition', 'One', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'slightly', 'altered', 'ending', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'well', 'be', 'included', 'Other', 'extras', 'are', 'commentary', 'story', 'points', 'have', ""n't"", 'looked', 'at.Since', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'SD', 'DVD', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'differences', 'two', 'formats', 'am', 'sure', 'contrast', 'been', 'boosted', 'touch', 'improvement', 'made', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'SD', 'DVD', 'surely', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'way', 'go.All', 'reviews', 'focus', 'solely', 'quality', 'transfers', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'video', 'audio', 'do', 'hope', 'review', 'been', 'help', 'deciding', 'purchase', 'decisions', 'am', 'correct', 'path', 'type', 'review.Thanks', 'reading']",Body of Lies

A very detailed story based on Ignatius' book that came across beautifully on screen. The stand alone performance of Mark Strong (once again) makes this entire film re-watchable and makes it a recommendation on him alone.The most challenging part of this BD was how to set the display. There are so many brights and contrasts, intertwined with intense darks and solemn indoor sequences, that it leaves it open for how you wish to best see the saturation lines. The best result/test was watching the dark black helicopters attacking the convoy whilst it is speeding through the bright desert. That sequence by itself has made for a solid BD display in the store. The sound, picture and presentation all look worthwhile for BD ownership. No complaints.The special features are thorough and cover virtually all aspects of the production. Different options are afforded to you should you wish to watch them separatley or while watching the film. The additional/deleted scenes in 1080 are a mixed bag of what should have stayed or was rightfully cut. The alternate ending was much more enjoyable for character closure, and the BD live options have some fun material. Also an interesting option involving a ""cross-graph"" of snippets from Scott, Leo and Crowe about the story and characters that you can select.

The film is based on the novel by David Ignatius.Leonardo DiCaprio continues to prove that he's got the acting chops and is believable in action films. Here he plays Roger Ferris, a CIA operative working to track down a bin Ladenesque terrorist named Al-Saleem. Al-Saleem's trail leads Ferris to Jordan, where he must balance working with and between his CIA handler (played with relish by an overweight, aged Russell Crowe) and the head of Jordanian intelligence (brilliantly played by Mark Strong), who are working at crosspurposes with each other. Ferris further complicates his mission by falling for an Iranian nurse (played by Golshifteh Farahani).The movie uses wild technology, lies and counterlies, torture, and Ferris' growing disdain with the intelligence community.

But the film actually delves much deeper into the bedlam of undercover missions, double-crosses and sabotage, and deals nail-biting suspense at every turn. Although the story looks like fuel for a Tony Scott (Ridley's brother) film, ala Spy Game, the sheer intensity, violence, immediacy and realism of the cinematography has Ridley's signature all over it.Based on David Ignatius' 2007 novel about CIA operative Roger Ferris (Leonardo DiCaprio), Body of Lies follows his undercover operations based around Iraq, Jordan (Amman), Dubai, Turkey, Syria, the U.S and more. Every move he makes is under aerial surveillance and the vigilant eye of Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe), his superior who continually yet unintentionally detrimentally interferes with crucial missions.Every objective for Ferris is surrounded by side missions, conflicting intelligence gathering, and double-crosses from both his government and the Jordan secret police group headed by Hani (Mark Strong). As the media is manipulated along with everyone involved in the uncovering of terrorist bombings across Europe, Ferris invents a fictitious alternate terrorist brotherhood to ferret out Al Saleem, a treacherous man known to be involved with the majority of the anonymous attacks. As Hoffman works to preserve his agents' involvement and Hani feeds his own ego, Ferris is confronted with several shocking revelations and choices that could ultimately lead to the death of his newfound love interest as well as his own.Body of Lies doesn't slow down to let the viewer catch up to all of the fast-talking political jargon, in-depth public opinion trajectory issues, and the guerilla warfare tactics employed by the allegedly unsophisticated enemy. If you miss something, you're on your own. But this breakneck pace coupled with relentless explosions and firefights, fierce chase sequences, grueling torture and continual brushes with death allows for blistering intensity and an experienced examination of suspense. Scott persists with plenty of close-ups that keep audiences on the edge of their seats, afraid of the next bullet or bomb that will certainly strike onscreen.While the structure found within Body of Lies is one not unfamiliar to Scott's films, the flawless acting by both Crowe and DiCaprio paired with an intricate plot of trust and betrayal keeps the anticipation from ever backing down. A few of the twists may be predictable, but the deceptive motives of each character will keep you guessing their reactions until the unsettling conclusion. Body of Lies isn't Scott's best, but it certainly retains the finest elements of the masterful director's style, attention to detail, and cunning build of tension and suspense.- The Massie Twins",3,Body of Lies Movie Review from The Massie Twins,1223510400,"10 9, 2008",2008,2886,"['decidedly', 'deceptive', 'trailer', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'new', 'covert', 'operations', 'film', 'Body', 'Lies', 'seem', 'battle', 'wits', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'film', 'actually', 'much', 'deeper', 'bedlam', 'undercover', 'missions', 'double-crosses', 'sabotage', 'deals', 'nail-biting', 'suspense', 'turn', 'story', 'fuel', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'Ridley', 'brother', 'film', 'ala', 'Spy', 'Game', 'sheer', 'intensity', 'violence', 'immediacy', 'realism', 'cinematography', 'Ridley', 'signature', 'it.Based', 'David', 'Ignatius', '2007', 'novel', 'CIA', 'operative', 'Roger', 'Ferris', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'Body', 'Lies', 'undercover', 'operations', 'based', 'Iraq', 'Jordan', 'Amman', 'Dubai', 'Turkey', 'Syria', 'U.S', 'more', 'move', 'aerial', 'surveillance', 'vigilant', 'eye', 'Ed', 'Hoffman', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'superior', 'who', 'continually', 'yet', 'unintentionally', 'detrimentally', 'crucial', 'missions.Every', 'objective', 'Ferris', 'surrounded', 'side', 'missions', 'conflicting', 'intelligence', 'gathering', 'double-crosses', 'government', 'Jordan', 'secret', 'police', 'group', 'headed', 'Hani', 'Mark', 'Strong', 'media', 'manipulated', 'everyone', 'involved', 'uncovering', 'terrorist', 'bombings', 'Europe', 'Ferris', 'fictitious', 'alternate', 'terrorist', 'brotherhood', 'ferret', 'out', 'Al', 'Saleem', 'treacherous', 'man', 'known', 'be', 'involved', 'majority', 'anonymous', 'attacks', 'Hoffman', 'preserve', 'agents', 'involvement', 'Hani', 'own', 'ego', 'Ferris', 'confronted', 'several', 'shocking', 'revelations', 'choices', 'could', 'ultimately', 'lead', 'death', 'newfound', 'love', 'interest', 'as', 'well', 'own.Body', 'Lies', ""n't"", 'slow', 'down', 'let', 'viewer', 'catch', 'fast-talking', 'political', 'jargon', 'in-depth', 'public', 'opinion', 'trajectory', 'issues', 'guerilla', 'warfare', 'tactics', 'employed', 'allegedly', 'unsophisticated', 'enemy', 'miss', 'something', ""'re"", 'own', 'breakneck', 'pace', 'coupled', 'relentless', 'explosions', 'firefights', 'fierce', 'chase', 'sequences', 'grueling', 'torture', 'continual', 'brushes', 'death', 'allows', 'blistering', 'intensity', 'experienced', 'examination', 'suspense', 'Scott', 'plenty', 'close-ups', 'keep', 'audiences', 'edge', 'seats', 'afraid', 'next', 'bullet', 'bomb', 'will', 'certainly', 'strike', 'structure', 'found', 'Body', 'Lies', 'one', 'not', 'unfamiliar', 'Scott', 'films', 'flawless', 'acting', 'Crowe', 'DiCaprio', 'paired', 'intricate', 'plot', 'trust', 'betrayal', 'anticipation', 'ever', 'backing', 'down', 'few', 'twists', 'may', 'be', 'predictable', 'deceptive', 'motives', 'character', 'will', 'keep', 'guessing', 'reactions', 'unsettling', 'conclusion', 'Body', 'Lies', ""n't"", 'Scott', 'best', 'certainly', 'finest', 'elements', 'masterful', 'director', 'style', 'attention', 'detail', 'cunning', 'build', 'tension', 'suspense.-', 'Massie', 'Twins']",Body of Lies

Noever ""Author of the TETHYS series""","[7, 9]","Films involving 'current events'--particularly those relating to anything happening in the Middle East and Terrorism--tend to be soaked in the writers', producers' and director's politics, which usually end up very much in-your-face and spoil the film, because you suddenly lose the story and drown in the preaching and proselytizing.Ridley Scott, who has already addressed the West-East/Christianity-Islam issue in a previous film, 'Kingdom of Heaven', this time bit the bullet (instead of the sword) and continued KoH's story about 1000 years later. 'Body of Lies' is very much a Ridley Scott movie and this translates into the film's politics as well. Thing is, you can't leave politics out of a political movie; and so what do you do?Well, here's a newsflash for the poli-preachers on all sides: it's possible to have it all, and just watch Ridley Scott do it. Just like KoH, it's all about even-handedness and realizing that (1) every side in a conflict has a point of view, which, to itself, is perfectly valid; and (2) every side has people you'd probably like and some you really wouldn't, (3) the way to peace lies with understanding (1) and (2); and not with having just one point of view, no matter how righteous it may appear. Both, Islamophobes and Islamophiles--or those on the extremes of any aspect of the political spectrum--will probably find ample elements to dislike about this film. Others of a more moderate and even-handed disposition will find much to like and appreciate.All of this, rather profound, stuff is wrapped up in a gritty Ridley Scott production and direction, that keeps your full attention for its full 2+ hours. Leonardo DiCaprio has really grown up and cast off his annoying persona, which was so prominent in just about all his movies; until 'Blood Diamond' came along. Russell Crowe is basically a secondary character, eclipsed almost completely by DiCaprio and Mark Strong. The latter has come a long way since I first saw him in the BBC production of Jane Austen's 'Emma'. The gentle and understated romance element provided by Golshifteh Farahani as 'Aisha' provided a nice contrast to the testosterone-soaked male world in which this drama plays out.The movie confirms what I've known for a long time: Ridley Scott apparently can do no wrong.",5,Ridley Scott tackles politics in the way only Ridley Scott can,1223510400,"10 9, 2008",2008,2288,"['Films', 'involving', ""'current"", 'events', 'particularly', 'relating', 'anything', 'happening', 'Middle', 'East', 'Terrorism', 'tend', 'be', 'soaked', 'writers', 'producers', 'director', 'politics', 'usually', 'end', 'up', 'very', 'much', 'in-your-face', 'spoil', 'film', 'suddenly', 'lose', 'story', 'drown', 'preaching', 'proselytizing.Ridley', 'Scott', 'who', 'already', 'addressed', 'West-East/Christianity-Islam', 'issue', 'previous', 'film', ""'Kingdom"", 'Heaven', 'time', 'bullet', 'instead', 'sword', 'continued', 'KoH', 'story', '1000', 'years', 'later', ""'Body"", 'Lies', 'very', 'much', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'movie', 'film', 'politics', 'well', 'Thing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'leave', 'politics', 'political', 'movie', 'so', 'what', 'do', 'do', 'Well', 'here', 'newsflash', 'poli-preachers', 'sides', 'possible', 'have', 'just', 'watch', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'do', 'Just', 'KoH', 'even-handedness', 'realizing', '1', 'side', 'conflict', 'point', 'view', 'perfectly', 'valid', '2', 'side', 'people', ""'d"", 'probably', 'like', 'really', 'would', ""n't"", '3', 'way', 'peace', 'lies', 'understanding', '1', '2', 'not', 'having', 'just', 'one', 'point', 'view', 'matter', 'how', 'righteous', 'may', 'appear', 'Islamophobes', 'Islamophiles', 'extremes', 'aspect', 'political', 'spectrum', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'ample', 'elements', 'dislike', 'film', 'Others', 'more', 'moderate', 'even-handed', 'disposition', 'will', 'find', 'much', 'like', 'appreciate.All', 'rather', 'profound', 'stuff', 'wrapped', 'up', 'gritty', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'production', 'direction', 'full', 'attention', 'full', '2+', 'hours', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'really', 'grown', 'up', 'cast', 'off', 'annoying', 'persona', 'was', 'so', 'prominent', 'just', 'movies', ""'Blood"", 'Diamond', 'came', 'along', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'basically', 'secondary', 'character', 'eclipsed', 'almost', 'completely', 'DiCaprio', 'Mark', 'Strong', 'latter', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'first', 'saw', 'BBC', 'production', 'Jane', 'Austen', ""'Emma"", 'gentle', 'understated', 'romance', 'element', 'provided', 'Golshifteh', 'Farahani', ""'Aisha"", 'provided', 'nice', 'contrast', 'testosterone-soaked', 'male', 'world', 'drama', 'out.The', 'movie', 'what', ""'ve"", 'known', 'long', 'time', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'apparently', 'can', 'do', 'wrong']",Body of Lies

1174267,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B001C4CI8A,Turfseer,"[3, 6]","Body of Lies is a story about a CIA operative played by Leonard Dicarprio and his boss, Ed Hoffman, played by Russell Crowe. Crowe gained about 40 lbs to play the middle-aged supervisor Hoffman who spends a good deal of time on a cellphone from CIA Headquarters in Langley, Virginia talking with Dicaprio's Roger Ferris who shuttles around the Mideast, principally in Iraq and Amman, Jordan. Ridley Scott, the director, makes use of pinpoint satellite images throughout the movie, suggesting that the CIA has the ability to spy on various targets closeup through the use of overhead drones. It's very cool looking but can they actually do that? I wonder.Body of Lies is divided into three sequences, the first taking place in Iraq where Ferris attempts to make contact with an Iraqi who may or may not have information about Al Qaeda. The informant's cover is blown and Ferris is forced to shoot him to prevent the informant from being tortured and revealing Ferris's identity. The first sequence ends in an exciting shootout with militants in a rural area where Ferris obtains information regarding a safe house in Amman, Jordan.The second sequence involves Ferris taking over CIA operations in Jordan. He meets with the Jordanian intelligence chief, Hani Salaam, played by the British actor, Mark Srong. Hani is depicted as urbane, highly competent and ruthless. He denies 'torturing' informants and when Ferris is brought in and observes them beating one of their own agents who hasn't followed orders, Hani tells Ferris that the operative is merely being ""punished"" not ""tortured"". Where Hani is smooth and calculating, Ferris's boss, Hoffman, the CIA chief, is depicted as impulsive and arrogant. He demands that Hani allow him to interrogate a contact, Karami, at the safe house who is already known to Jordanian intelligence. Hani adopts a patient approach and is content to leave Karami at the safe house and pry him later for intelligence.After a terrorist bombing in Amsterdam, Hoffman feels compelled to get ""results"". Without telling Ferris, he orders some of his operatives to tail Karami. Somehow Karami's cover isn't blown but it's enough for the militants at the safe house to set it on fire and flee for parts unknown. Hani is angry at Ferris who denies knowing anything about what happened and is ordered out of Jordan.The third sequence is the most implausible and weakest part of the movie. Hoffman and Ferris meet and Ferris comes up with an absurd plan to capture the terrorist they've been after, Al-Saleem. Inexplicably, Ferris, who has been opposed to Hoffman's amoral and impulsive methods, outdoes Hoffman when he suggests that they invent a terrorist to make Al-Saleem jealous. With the aid of a computer geek employed by the CIA, Ferris focuses on Omar Sadiki, a hapless Jordanian architect who is set up to be the next Bin Laden. Incredibly, they're able to convince Turkish officials to desecrate corpses obtained from a local morgue and use them as part of a plot to simulate a terrorist attack on an US Military facility. Meanwhile, Ferris has a change of heart and finally realizes that Sadiki is at risk to be killed by terrorists. After the simulated terrorist attack, the plot goes awry and Sadiki is killed by terrorists when they realize he's a harmless dupe.I haven't mentioned that there is a romantic subplot in this movie. Ferris falls for an Iranian nurse, Aisha, after she treats him at a local clinic for dog bites. At the climax, she disappears and appears to be kidnapped. Ferris meets with the kidnappers who turn out to be Al-Saleem and his henchmen. As it turns out, the noble Hani was the one who grabbed Aisha all along and used Ferris so he could lead him to Al-Saleem. In a harrowing scene, Ferris is almost beheaded by Al-Saleem's goons but in pure Hollywood style, Hani and his agents burst in and prevent Ferris from being killed. Al-Saleem is also taken into custody.In reading some postings on the internet, some residents of Jordan feel that 'Body of Lies' maligns their dear country. This I can't understand; true, not all the scenes depict the natural beauty of Jordan but hey this is a movie about terrorism and not a travelogue. What's more, Hani, is the real hero here--intelligent, smooth and cool-headed (one who 'punishes' and doesn't 'torture'). Unfortunately, the CIA once again gets short shrift. Just like in 'Traitor' and The Bourne series, the CIA are either bumbling idiots or Machiavellian schemers (or both).Body of Lies has some nice cinematography and its greatest asset is the depiction of the Al Qaeda wannabe, Al-Saleem. He looks and sounds like the real thing and Ridley Scott correctly doesn't sugarcoat his terrorists. DiCaprio has a nice speech condemning Al-Saleem and his minions right before he's about to be beheaded.Despite this, Body of Lies errs in sugarcoating the Jordanian intelligence service at the expense of the CIA. Are they so much better than the CIA in real life? I think they're built up in order to shoot the CIA down and it doesn't ring true. Furthermore, Body of Lies features the ugly suggestion that the CIA would take an innocent man and set him up to be killed by terrorists. Of course if you're a conspiracy theorist, then you'll believe the CIA is capable of anything. Body of Lies is a mildly interesting spy thriller. It's worth viewing once but due to its implausible moments and somewhat anti-American bent, I wouldn't watch it again.",2,CIA made to look bad again in this mildly interesting spy

Here I'm thinking about getting more hours at work - they are wondering when they are going to be blown to pieces.. sure the movies may heighten that aspect, but for all intents and purposes I think they are closer to the truth than a lie.Body of Lies itself is a real winner. I'm starting to think Leo Di cannot be a focal character in a movie I won't love - his track record for me is so damn stellar. The movie feels like two movies in one - the first half focus's on the known safe house of Al-Saleem to which I thought was the stronger aspect; everything felt very organic and had a somewhat 'you are there on location' feel. The second half (once they lose the safe house) - the 'orchestrating' of a terrorist group to draw out Al-Saleem felt highly improbable, something more akin to a Bond film - but still with Leo Di at the helm I somehow felt I too could create my own terrorist network out of spamming a Yahoo account, lol...The romance. Loved it. Superb performances with real chemistry by Leo and ""Aisha"". Russell Crowe was about the only thing that felt a bit ""off"" in Body of Lies.. It's obvious he tried to fatten up for the role, different hair color, etc - but under all that I still see a Gladiator, lol.. it's not that he wasn't at least partially convincing, it's that as a viewer I don't really want to have to struggle too hard to distance myself from an actor and a role they aren't typically in - so this could be my bias - but if you threw Philip Seymour Hoffman into this role he would have melded right in as opposed to being forced into it.
