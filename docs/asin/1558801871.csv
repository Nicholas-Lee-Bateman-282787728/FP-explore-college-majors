178121,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,1558801871,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[3, 14]","I am normally a Spike Lee fan. It takes some time to really get into his ""mojo"", but once you see the clear message and the ability to tell the story that is close to his heart, Lee is a genius. Unlike The 25th Hour or Bamboozled (two of my favorite films of his), there was no clear story in this film. I was able to understand the struggle between Washington and the choice to play well or be influenced by others, but for some odd reason Lee was never able to get the true feeling out. Washington did a decent job with what was handed to him, but you could tell that this was not Lee's favorite film. Not only did Lee direct this film, but he also wrote it. You could tell. The camera work was horrid and the writing only contributed to the decay of the film. This film was coming full circle and it wasn't going to be pretty. Lee was not 100% behind this film as he was with Do the Right Thing. Of all the films I have seen Lee direct, this was the brightest and more modest of his films. It was almost as if he created a Hollywood movie instead of one that was all his own. I don't know if he saw the money from Do the Right Thing and ran with it, or what ... but this film did not demonstrate his true talent.For anyone out there that has seen this film, and perhaps stopped watching anything directed by Spike Lee afterwards due to this film, I suggest you give him a second chance. Don't get me wrong, I see exactly where you are coming from with this film and why you would want to put this behind you, but Lee does grow up. His work becomes more of his own, and you can see the transformation from a desire to make money to just wanting to make good films. It took me awhile to watch The 25th Hour, but when I did, it was sheer brilliance. Perhaps it was the actors, perhaps the story, but Lee crafted an amazing film out of one man's journey into the unknown. I guess that is what I was hoping Mo' Better Blues would turn out to be. This really dark journey into the life of a man that really never grew up, but instead all I got was Denzel being Denzel. He really is one of the most versatile actors of this generation, and I do consider him the Sydney Poitier of cinema, but this was not the film to showcase his talent.Another issue that I had with this film was the use of Spike's sister playing one of the love interests. I don't know about you, and your family, but I do not think that I could have filmed a sex scene with my sister. I don't care who the actor is or how much money I am getting paid, I would never do it. It is just something that I never wish to see, but apparently that is different for Spike. He went ahead and showed the full nude image of his sister without any remorse. It was sad and it even made me blush. Also, I need somebody to answer me this. What was Flavor Flav doing introducing this film? So, I am sitting there on my couch, ready to start the film, when suddenly there is a voice from the past spelling out the studio that made this film, then he acknowledges himself. That did not build for a strong remaining of the story. Again, I felt that Lee was going for money on this film instead of actual talent. Perhaps that is how he could afford both Denzel and Wesley in the same movie without any explosions.There were two great scenes in this film that made it worth watching through to the end. Don't get me wrong, this was a very bad movie, but there is always a diamond in every alleyway. The scene when Bleek accidentally forgets which woman he is with was mesmerizing. He continually went back and forth, weaving truth to confusion in a way that proved that Lee was actually behind the camera. It was a visionary scene that was probably lost in the shuffle due to the remaining poor scenes. The other scene that was worth watching was the way that Lee introduced and ended the film. By keeping the same pacing and direction, he was able to bring this tragic character around full circle and give him the chance to change his life.  Other than these two moments, the rest of the film was pure rubbish, not worth viewing unless you are about to go blind.Grade: ** out of *****",2,Cause mo better makes it mo better.,1108080000,"02 11, 2005",2005,4130,"['am', 'normally', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'fan', 'time', 'really', 'get', 'mojo', 'once', 'see', 'clear', 'message', 'ability', 'tell', 'story', 'close', 'heart', 'Lee', 'genius', '25th', 'Hour', 'Bamboozled', 'two', 'favorite', 'films', 'was', 'clear', 'story', 'film', 'was', 'able', 'understand', 'struggle', 'Washington', 'choice', 'play', 'well', 'be', 'influenced', 'others', 'odd', 'reason', 'Lee', 'was', 'never', 'able', 'get', 'true', 'feeling', 'out', 'Washington', 'did', 'decent', 'job', 'what', 'was', 'handed', 'could', 'tell', 'was', 'not', 'Lee', 'favorite', 'film', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'Lee', 'direct', 'film', 'also', 'wrote', 'could', 'tell', 'camera', 'work', 'was', 'horrid', 'writing', 'only', 'contributed', 'decay', 'film', 'film', 'was', 'coming', 'full', 'circle', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'pretty', 'Lee', 'was', 'not', '100', '%', 'film', 'was', 'Do', 'Right', 'Thing', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'Lee', 'direct', 'was', 'brightest', 'more', 'modest', 'films', 'was', 'almost', 'created', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'instead', 'one', 'was', 'own', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'saw', 'money', 'Do', 'Right', 'Thing', 'ran', 'what', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'demonstrate', 'true', 'talent.For', 'anyone', 'there', 'seen', 'film', 'perhaps', 'stopped', 'watching', 'anything', 'directed', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'afterwards', 'due', 'film', 'suggest', 'give', 'second', 'chance', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'see', 'exactly', 'where', 'are', 'coming', 'film', 'why', 'would', 'want', 'put', 'behind', 'Lee', 'grow', 'up', 'work', 'more', 'own', 'can', 'see', 'transformation', 'desire', 'make', 'money', 'just', 'wanting', 'make', 'good', 'films', 'took', 'awhile', 'watch', '25th', 'Hour', 'when', 'did', 'was', 'sheer', 'brilliance', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'actors', 'perhaps', 'story', 'Lee', 'crafted', 'amazing', 'film', 'one', 'man', 'journey', 'unknown', 'guess', 'what', 'was', 'hoping', 'Mo', 'Better', 'Blues', 'would', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'really', 'dark', 'journey', 'life', 'man', 'really', 'never', 'grew', 'up', 'instead', 'got', 'was', 'Denzel', 'being', 'Denzel', 'really', 'one', 'most', 'versatile', 'actors', 'generation', 'do', 'consider', 'Sydney', 'Poitier', 'cinema', 'was', 'not', 'film', 'showcase', 'talent.Another', 'issue', 'had', 'film', 'was', 'use', 'Spike', 'sister', 'playing', 'one', 'love', 'interests', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'family', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'filmed', 'sex', 'scene', 'sister', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'who', 'actor', 'how', 'much', 'money', 'am', 'getting', 'paid', 'would', 'never', 'do', 'just', 'something', 'never', 'wish', 'see', 'apparently', 'different', 'Spike', 'went', 'ahead', 'showed', 'full', 'nude', 'image', 'sister', 'remorse', 'was', 'sad', 'even', 'made', 'blush', 'Also', 'need', 'somebody', 'answer', 'What', 'was', 'Flavor', 'Flav', 'doing', 'introducing', 'film', 'So', 'am', 'sitting', 'there', 'couch', 'ready', 'start', 'film', 'when', 'suddenly', 'voice', 'past', 'spelling', 'out', 'studio', 'made', 'film', 'then', 'did', 'not', 'build', 'strong', 'remaining', 'story', 'Again', 'felt', 'Lee', 'was', 'going', 'money', 'film', 'instead', 'actual', 'talent', 'Perhaps', 'how', 'could', 'afford', 'Denzel', 'Wesley', 'same', 'movie', 'were', 'two', 'great', 'scenes', 'film', 'made', 'worth', 'watching', 'end', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'was', 'very', 'bad', 'movie', 'always', 'diamond', 'alleyway', 'scene', 'when', 'Bleek', 'accidentally', 'woman', 'was', 'mesmerizing', 'continually', 'went', 'back', 'forth', 'weaving', 'truth', 'confusion', 'way', 'proved', 'Lee', 'was', 'actually', 'camera', 'was', 'visionary', 'scene', 'was', 'probably', 'lost', 'shuffle', 'due', 'remaining', 'poor', 'scenes', 'other', 'scene', 'was', 'worth', 'watching', 'was', 'way', 'Lee', 'introduced', 'ended', 'film', 'keeping', 'same', 'pacing', 'direction', 'was', 'able', 'bring', 'tragic', 'character', 'full', 'circle', 'give', 'chance', 'change', 'life', 'Other', 'two', 'moments', 'rest', 'film', 'was', 'pure', 'rubbish', 'not', 'worth', 'viewing', 'are', 'go', 'blind.Grade', '**', '*****']",N/A
178122,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,1558801871,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","I don't typically care too much for Spike Lee's films.  I find him to be an arrogant director, and it shows in the way he pieces his films together.  When a creative mind is too wound up in their own ego it transcends the expected `point of view' scenario and delves into shameless self-promotion, and Spike Lee Joints tend to cross that line too often for my taste.  That said, the man does have a real gift, and when he checks his ego at the door he can produce some great work (`25th Hour' is a modern American masterpiece).`Mo' Better Blues' feels less like a Spike Lee Joint and more like a film directed by Spike Lee.That's a good thing.The film tells the story of Jazz trumpeter Bleek Gilliam.  Bleek is obsessed with his music to the point where everything and everyone takes a backseat to his work.  He designates an allotted time every day for practice, and he doesn't allow interferences.  He refuses to mix business with pleasure, to his detriment at times (like holding a young vocalist back simply because he's too prideful to allow someone steel his thunder) and he is continually at odds with another hot-shot, Shadow, who happens to play sax in his band.  Bleek is also juggling two women who happen to know about one another but continue to date him, as well as a gambling manager who can't seem to do his job right.  All of this weighs heavy on Bleek, but he remains as cool as a cat until the pressure snaps him in two, and he finds himself washed up, with nothing to show for it.Wesley Snipes, Joie Lee and Cynda Williams are all stellar here.  Snipes is especially memorable as the aggressive Shadow.  The way he makes every scene about him is remarkable, because it never feels like camera mugging but feels authentic; completely part of the character.  Lee looks far too much like her brother (to the point where her love scenes are kind of scary), but she emotes beautifully; and the gorgeous Williams sizzles and steals glances throughout the entire film.  Denzel Washington is a bit too reserved here, to the point where he disappears throughout most of the film, despite the film being about him.  He feels uninteresting.  I'm surprised that some have noted him as being charismatic, because it isn't until he gets on the stage that he shows any signs of charisma.  Dually noted is the horrifically stereotypical way in which Lee depicts Turturro's character; but that is a major issue with Lee's pictures in general.  He really creates far too many stereotypes in all of his characters, especially in those who do not share his skin tone.  His arrogance shines through in the way he writes.I've always said that Spike Lee should cut out the writing and simply stick to directing, which is his true gift.But, that aside, `Mo' Better Blues' is a slick picture, one that is beautiful to look at and one that remains steadily interesting and avoids clich&eacute;d pit falls that could have befallen it easily.  That isn't to say that it isn't clich&eacute;d, but at least it feels well rounded in most parts.  I felt that the ending was a tad rushed through, although I understand its necessity.  The music is wonderful and the script is `mostly' above average.  It is one of Lee's best pictures because it feels less like a lecture and more like an objectively crafted film.",4,It's mo' better than I thought it would be...,1315526400,"09 9, 2011",2011,3300,"['do', ""n't"", 'typically', 'care', 'too', 'much', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'films', 'find', 'be', 'arrogant', 'director', 'way', 'films', 'together', 'When', 'creative', 'mind', 'too', 'wound', 'up', 'own', 'ego', 'expected', 'point', 'view', 'scenario', 'shameless', 'self-promotion', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'Joints', 'tend', 'cross', 'line', 'too', 'often', 'taste', 'said', 'man', 'have', 'real', 'gift', 'when', 'ego', 'door', 'can', 'produce', 'great', 'work', '25th', 'Hour', 'modern', 'American', 'masterpiece', 'Mo', 'Better', 'Blues', 'feels', 'less', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'Joint', 'more', 'film', 'directed', 'Spike', 'Lee.That', 'good', 'thing.The', 'film', 'story', 'Jazz', 'trumpeter', 'Bleek', 'Gilliam', 'Bleek', 'obsessed', 'music', 'point', 'where', 'everything', 'everyone', 'backseat', 'work', 'allotted', 'time', 'day', 'practice', ""n't"", 'allow', 'interferences', 'mix', 'business', 'pleasure', 'detriment', 'times', 'holding', 'young', 'vocalist', 'back', 'simply', 'too', 'prideful', 'allow', 'someone', 'steel', 'thunder', 'continually', 'odds', 'hot-shot', 'Shadow', 'who', 'play', 'sax', 'band', 'Bleek', 'also', 'juggling', 'two', 'women', 'who', 'happen', 'know', 'one', 'continue', 'date', 'as', 'well', 'gambling', 'manager', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'do', 'job', 'right', 'heavy', 'Bleek', 'as', 'cool', 'cat', 'pressure', 'two', 'washed', 'up', 'nothing', 'show', 'it.Wesley', 'Snipes', 'Joie', 'Lee', 'Cynda', 'Williams', 'are', 'stellar', 'here', 'Snipes', 'especially', 'memorable', 'aggressive', 'Shadow', 'way', 'scene', 'remarkable', 'never', 'camera', 'mugging', 'feels', 'authentic', 'completely', 'part', 'character', 'Lee', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'brother', 'point', 'where', 'love', 'scenes', 'are', 'kind', 'scary', 'beautifully', 'gorgeous', 'Williams', 'sizzles', 'steals', 'glances', 'entire', 'film', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'bit', 'too', 'reserved', 'here', 'point', 'where', 'most', 'film', 'film', 'being', 'uninteresting', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'have', 'noted', 'being', 'charismatic', ""n't"", 'stage', 'signs', 'charisma', 'Dually', 'noted', 'horrifically', 'stereotypical', 'way', 'Lee', 'Turturro', 'character', 'major', 'issue', 'Lee', 'pictures', 'general', 'really', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'stereotypes', 'characters', 'especially', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'share', 'skin', 'tone', 'arrogance', 'shines', 'way', ""'ve"", 'always', 'said', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'should', 'cut', 'out', 'writing', 'simply', 'stick', 'directing', 'true', 'gift.But', 'aside', 'Mo', 'Better', 'Blues', 'slick', 'picture', 'one', 'beautiful', 'look', 'one', 'steadily', 'interesting', 'avoids', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'pit', 'could', 'have', 'befallen', 'easily', ""n't"", 'say', ""n't"", 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'least', 'well', 'rounded', 'most', 'parts', 'felt', 'ending', 'was', 'tad', 'rushed', 'understand', 'necessity', 'music', 'wonderful', 'script', 'mostly', 'above', 'average', 'one', 'Lee', 'best', 'pictures', 'less', 'lecture', 'more', 'objectively', 'crafted', 'film']",N/A

178124,A7U9ZYF780PE9,1558801871,Brian,"[0, 0]","Spike once said that this is a film about a genius battling his inner demons.  Like every great musician, the one thing he loves most can not love him back, and he can only hope to hold on to it forever.  When he  loses it, he must come to grips with his isolation.  Viewed in that light,  I think Spike did an OK job.  Not great, just OK.I think Spike tried to  hide Bleek's bad side until after he lost his music.  He made Bleek look  like a virtuoso that had it all - talent, success and women.  I think that  as far as the story, Spike overlooked many of the details in character  development that could have made the movie more dramatic and would have  given the viewer more insight into the pain Bleek experienced.  We had to  rely on Denzel's acting (which was excellent) to understand the heartache.  And Spike perhaps spent too much time on Giant's development.  Giant was a  supporting character, but oft times seemed to be the star.  (Was it Spike's  own ego that caused him to do this?)  And I think because of the lack of  character development, Bleek's return to Indigo, albiet emotional and  heartfeeling, was just not truly believable.This is a film with  excellent acting, cinematography, dialogue, music and sound, but the story,  unfortunately, does not hold up to tight scrutiny.

178126,A2PBV1899CX3TE,1558801871,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[1, 1]","Bleek Gilliam (Denzel Washington) plays trumpet and leads his own jazz band. Giant (Spike Lee), his manager, doesn't do such a great job, and he has a gambling problem, but they have been friends since childhood. Shadow Henderson (Wesley Snipes) plays soprano and tenor saxophone. He has also known Bleek since childhood, but they are more like rivals then friends--rivals over women and music. Bleek is the bandleader, but Shadow is shadowing him, scheming to start his own band with one of Bleek's women. Left Hand Lacey (Giancarlo Esposito) plays piano, but nobody can stand his French girlfriend. She makes him constantly late and breaks the band rule about no girlfriends in the dressing room. Mainly, they don't like her because she's white, especially Giant, but he refuses to acknowledge his racism.Bottom Hammer (Bill Nunn) hammers down the bottom with his bass. Rhythm Jones (Jeff 'Tain' Watts) is the rim shot tempo man. He is also a drummer in real life, and plays with the Branford Marsalis group that at the time was The Tonight Show with Jay Leno's house band. He quit that gig because he was serious about music. Branford is the one who plays the actual saxophone heard on the soundtrack, and Terrance Blanchard provides the trumpet. They both sound excellent, and the scenes on the bandstand are some of the movie's finest moments. Other scenes have excellent music as well, chosen from the archives of Miles Davis (All Blues, to name one) and John Coltrane. Indeed, they wanted to call the movie 'A Love Supreme' but they couldn't get permission from Alice Coltrane and the Coltrane estate. Hmm. Wonder if Branford ever kicks himself for quitting the Tonight Show gig? Easy money.Washington & Snipes do a good job of acting like they are playing, and acting in between musical interludes. They were coached in how to play their instruments, and though they couldn't really get much out, in the way of sound, they were able to act the part convincingly enough. Denzel even gets in some singing--though it is more like rapping, poetry, or perhaps spoken word with music? He has a good voice, and carries it off splendidly. Washington & Snipes are a great combination of characters, with Wesley like a kind of bleak shadow, an anti-matter doppelganger of Denzel's darker instincts. But Snipes isn't really the bad guy here, he just wants to take one of Bleek's girlfriends, Clarke Bentancourt (Cynda Williams), because Bleek won't even give her a chance to sing, and Shadow wants to feature her in his own group.If there is one sin that Shadow commits, it is that he wants to sell out, to play smooth jazz if it will make more money.Clarke isn't really a jazz singer, but Cynda Williams was signed to record an album for Sony. But the project was shelved. She might have made it as a singer, but because of the movie, Mo' Better Blues, that was supposed to launch her career, she was pushed into a jazz bag. She isn't a jazz singer, and I'm not saying she is a bad singer, she is a very talented singer and the part where she finally sings is very enjoyable. But she is not a jazz singer.Therefore, the fact that Shadow's band which features Clarke flourishes while Bleek's dies a dismal death makes for a very unsatisfactory ending. Smooth jazz? Is there no justice in the world?By the way, his father, Bill Lee, a jazz bass player, also composed music for the film. Sadly, this was the last movie for his son he was able to do that. The film is a heartfelt tribute to jazz, the music of Spike's father. Kind of like his own riff on Song for My Father by Horace Silver?One other thing--Bleek's other girlfriend, Indigo Downes is played by Joie Lee, Spike's sister.John and Nicholas Turturro play Moe and Josh Flatbush, the club owners. John Turturro is really making a name for himself as a character actor, notably in movies by the Cohen brothers. I assume Nicholas is his brother. They like numbers, and have some amusing routines. Some critics found these characters a little unsettling and anti semetic, even.Robin Harris, a chitlin' circuit comedian, plays chitlin' circuit comedian Butterbean Jones. Mr. Harris passed away soon after the filming wrapped, and the movie is dedicated to him. Though he provided comic relief, he didn't really fit in with the jazz club as run by Moe and Josh Flatbush. He was an anachronism, like when an extra in a crowd scene in The Greatest Story Ever Told is spotted wearing a wristwatch. Samuel L. Jackson plays a sadistic bill collector for Giant's bookie. Samuel enjoys his work too much.The main problem with the movie though, is when the director (Spike Lee) steps in front of the camera. He is just not a compelling character, but he makes it all about himself. I am struck by the fact that in so many ways he is like Woody Allen. They both like jazz, comedy, and sports, and they both insert themselves into movies they direct. Sometimes to the movies detriment. But I digress...I loved the movie up to about three quarters of the way, but then began the downward spiral. Bleek was not that bad a guy. The punishment didn't fit the crime. Miles Davis, Lee Morgan, Freddie Hubbard, did much worse and were bigger jerks than Bleek could even dream of being. As a morality tale, it doesn't cut it.Take Chet Baker. He was hit in the mouth by drug dealers, and lost all his teeth. It took him a few years to get his sound back, but he figured out a way to get a beautiful sound, even though he was old, tore up from the floor up, and lacked teeth. Bleek is super dedicated and lives for his music. But we are supposed to just believe that after one beat down, he could never really play again. Sorry if I spoiled the ending, but the ending spoils the movie. Set your watch to three quarters of the way, stop the tape, and rewind it. Repeat as necessary.The parts where Spike celebrates jazz, the trumpet, the beauty of women, and baseball, are superb. The parts where he takes on issues--race relations, gambling addictions, male/female relations, are half baked. Not that he should never take on issues, but in this movie there were so many issues and so little solutions or insights. He as a director lost control of the material. Do the right thing, Spike. He got in his own way, so to speak. But I am still giving the movie 4 stars, just for the beautiful music in the beginning parts. So, like I say: Set your watch to three quarters of the way, stop the tape, and rewind it. Repeat as necessary.TOP TEN MOVIES, BOOKS, OR CDS TO WATCH, READ, OR HEAR IN CONJUNCTION WITH MO' BETTER BLUES1.Let's Get Lost(1988) Documentary about trumpeter Chet Baker. An elderly Chet still has it, and is seen with Chris Isaak and Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Also, archival footage of a young Chet who not only sounded great, he looked marvelous.2.To Wong Foo Thanks for Everything Julie Newmar(1995) Wesley Snipes plays Noxeema Jackson, in the best drag performance since Lemmon and Curtis in Some Like It Hot.3.Training Day(2001) Denzel Washington won an Oscar for his portrayal of Alonzo, a rogue cop. It was a great year for Afro American Actors as Halle Berry also won; making it a sweep of the top 2 acting categories, and Sidney Poitier was also given a lifetime achievement award.4.Malcolm X(1992) Denzel Washington played Malcolm X. Spike Lee directs. If Spike didn't direct it, then flame me in the comments. I can't afford a fancy fact checker.5.Glory(1989) Denzel Washington played Pvt. Trip, for which he won an Oscar for best supporting.6.Round Midnight(1986) This movie starred Dexter Gordon as a character that must have been based on Lester Young. It was directed by a French guy, and they sometimes put things like Jerry Lewis and Jazz up on a pedestal. While they are right to put Jazz on a pedestal, they sometimes come off like Wayne and Garth protesting that they are not worthy. I mean like, they might put mediocre jazz up on a pedestal, just because it is jazz. But it's great to see Dexter because he has such stage presence, even if he's not that good of an actor. Long tall Dexter used to look so interesting he could draw a crowd just by taking his horn out of the case.7.Bamboozled (New Line Platinum Series)(2000) This movie dropped like a rock before I could see it, but the idea of a Minstrel Show revival being the latest fad to sweep TV is very promising. Would love to see this story get the Spike treatment.8.Kind of Bluesome of this music is featured in the movie. This just might be the best selling jazz album of all time, but it is also one of the greatest. It garnered commercial success as a fluke, in spite of the fact that the music is deep and profound.

With specific regards to Lee's pre-Malcom X canon, his movies are filled with rich characters, fantastic actors, unconventional camerawork/editing, fun music, and genuine emotion. Mo' Better Blues deftly blends visceral, realistic subject matter with a bizarre, experimental style to create something that almost no other director can pull off well. The film is about Bleek Gilliam, a selfish musician struggling to find a balance with his personal life and his passion. He juggles two girlfriends, a backing band he believes is stifling his potential, a manager with a gambling addiction, and eventually, he loses control of his entire life. Spike Lee is an ambitious writer to say the least. In every film, he strives to cram as much material as possible into each reel. Most of the time, this is effective and gives his work a dense quality that most other films are lacking. But in Mo' Better Blues, on more than one occasion, Spike loses his grip on the pace because of his desire to stuff it to the gills with content. 20-30 minutes of extra breathing room could have done it some good. From a technical standpoint, MBB is stunning. Lee and DP Ernest Dickerson continue with the kind of wild, innovatory camerawork used in 1989's Do The Right Thing. There are some angles, camera movements, and lighting that simply can't be found in other mainstream movies. The music is downright astounding. Bill Lee, Spike's Father, provides the score while the Branford Marsalis Quartet and Terence Blanchard composed and played the jazz songs by MBB'S fictional band. The most notable songs on the soundtrack are the title track, Mo' Better Blues, and the brilliant Pop Top 40. Denzel Washington as Bleek Gilliam is not amazing, but exactly what the film needed. Bleek is a fairly casual and non-eccentric character for a musician, and Denzel Washington and his clean looks and mild-mannered personality fit the bill perfectly. Wesley Snipes tops Washington as Shadow Henderson, Bleek's bandmate who is trying to break out on his own. Snipes, a captivating actor, is a brilliant foil for Washington. Spike Lee stars as Giant, the gambling-addicted manager, in one of his most palatable on-screen roles. Lee is only an OK actor, but he plays the butt-of-the-joke little guy splendidly. The two lead actresses (Bleek's lovers), Joie Lee, Spike's sister, and Cynda Williams in her debut role, are both equally talented yet unmistakably different personalities. Smaller but memorable roles include actors Charlie Murphy, Samuel L. Jackson, Giancarlo Esposito, John Turturro, and Robin Harris in his final role. Mo' Better Blues doesn't lack ambition, but it doesn't quite rise to the level of its brothers, Do The Right Thing and Jungle Fever.",4,"In The Meantime, I'll Settle For Some Of That Mo' Better",1402444800,"06 11, 2014",2014,2829,"['Spike', 'Lee', 'may', 'not', 'make', 'perfect', 'films', 'way', 'can', 'be', 'accused', 'being', 'boring', 'specific', 'regards', 'Lee', 'pre-Malcom', 'X', 'canon', 'movies', 'are', 'filled', 'rich', 'characters', 'fantastic', 'actors', 'unconventional', 'camerawork/editing', 'fun', 'music', 'genuine', 'emotion', 'Mo', 'Better', 'Blues', 'deftly', 'visceral', 'realistic', 'subject', 'matter', 'bizarre', 'experimental', 'style', 'create', 'something', 'almost', 'other', 'director', 'can', 'pull', 'off', 'well', 'film', 'Bleek', 'Gilliam', 'selfish', 'musician', 'struggling', 'find', 'balance', 'personal', 'life', 'passion', 'two', 'girlfriends', 'backing', 'band', 'stifling', 'potential', 'manager', 'gambling', 'addiction', 'eventually', 'control', 'entire', 'life', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'ambitious', 'writer', 'say', 'least', 'film', 'cram', 'as', 'much', 'material', 'possible', 'reel', 'Most', 'time', 'effective', 'work', 'dense', 'quality', 'most', 'other', 'films', 'are', 'lacking', 'Mo', 'Better', 'Blues', 'more', 'one', 'occasion', 'Spike', 'grip', 'pace', 'desire', 'stuff', 'gills', 'content', '20-30', 'minutes', 'extra', 'breathing', 'room', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'good', 'technical', 'standpoint', 'MBB', 'stunning', 'Lee', 'DP', 'Ernest', 'Dickerson', 'continue', 'kind', 'wild', 'innovatory', 'camerawork', 'used', '1989', 'Do', 'Right', 'Thing', 'are', 'angles', 'camera', 'movements', 'lighting', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'found', 'other', 'mainstream', 'movies', 'music', 'downright', 'astounding', 'Bill', 'Lee', 'Spike', 'Father', 'score', 'Branford', 'Marsalis', 'Quartet', 'Terence', 'Blanchard', 'composed', 'played', 'jazz', 'songs', 'MBB', 'fictional', 'band', 'most', 'notable', 'songs', 'soundtrack', 'are', 'title', 'track', 'Mo', 'Better', 'Blues', 'brilliant', 'Pop', 'Top', '40', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Bleek', 'Gilliam', 'not', 'amazing', 'exactly', 'what', 'film', 'needed', 'Bleek', 'fairly', 'casual', 'non-eccentric', 'character', 'musician', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'clean', 'looks', 'mild-mannered', 'personality', 'fit', 'bill', 'perfectly', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'Washington', 'Shadow', 'Henderson', 'Bleek', 'bandmate', 'who', 'trying', 'break', 'out', 'own', 'Snipes', 'captivating', 'actor', 'brilliant', 'foil', 'Washington', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'Giant', 'gambling-addicted', 'manager', 'one', 'most', 'palatable', 'on-screen', 'roles', 'Lee', 'only', 'OK', 'actor', 'butt-of-the-joke', 'little', 'guy', 'splendidly', 'two', 'lead', 'actresses', 'Bleek', 'lovers', 'Joie', 'Lee', 'Spike', 'sister', 'Cynda', 'Williams', 'debut', 'role', 'are', 'equally', 'talented', 'yet', 'unmistakably', 'different', 'personalities', 'Smaller', 'memorable', 'roles', 'include', 'actors', 'Charlie', 'Murphy', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Giancarlo', 'Esposito', 'John', 'Turturro', 'Robin', 'Harris', 'final', 'role', 'Mo', 'Better', 'Blues', ""n't"", 'lack', 'ambition', ""n't"", 'quite', 'rise', 'level', 'brothers', 'Do', 'Right', 'Thing', 'Jungle', 'Fever']",N/A

When Eastwood's ""Bird"" came out,  Lee disparaged Clint because of the fact he was White and had no business doing a film on a prominent Black musician. Of course this was a ploy by Spike to promote this film which promptly alienated me from ever watching a Spike Lee movie in its entirety.  Along with ""Jungle Fever"", this has to be one of Lee's worst movies.  For instance, in one nightclub scene, all we see are mostly Blacks in the club but I know for a fact that most of the clients there are mixed, Black, White, Latino, Asian, etc.  Also what period was Lee setting this in? If it is the present then why does he have them wear Zoot suits which was a fixture of the '40. Plus the most objection piece of business Lee put into the film was the inclusion of the greedy Jewish clubowners.  To me this smacks of Anti-Semitism and to put injury to blame, he used an Italian-American (the often used but brilliant John Turturro) for this gross caricature. I know there are a lot of Jews do own clubs in NYC but they have also been been beneficial to the plight of the musicians, Black or White, by putting on benefits to cover their medical expenses by using their clubs.  Another ugly example of Spike's writing is the incident of the French woman who is mal-treated and made fun of by the musicians in the club. This struck me as plain mis-oygnistic. I know a number of African-American actors and writers who really hate Spike Lee!!  One female writer, in particular, told me at conference in LA that when she posed a question as to why there aren't enough Black women in his films, Lee shouted back at her, ""Shut up you n--er B--h(euphemism for a female dog).  Now Lee is continuing his on slaught at Eastwood by saying why weren't there any blacks in his WWII films in order to promote his war movie.  Anyway, I'm sorry to digress here but if you want to see a better film on Jazz then see either ""Bird"" or ""Round Midnight""- 2 films Lee himself put down. Perhaps I should give this an extra star for the excellent Terrence Blanchard score-maybe Spike should take screenwriting course before I change my mind.",1,"Spike should have made a ""Mo better movie""",1214352000,"06 25, 2008",2008,2208,"['midst', 'recent', 'Eastwood-Lee', 'controversy', 'feel', 'should', 'submit', 'review', 'When', 'Eastwood', 'Bird', 'came', 'out', 'Lee', 'disparaged', 'Clint', 'fact', 'was', 'White', 'had', 'business', 'doing', 'film', 'prominent', 'Black', 'musician', 'course', 'was', 'ploy', 'Spike', 'promote', 'film', 'promptly', 'alienated', 'ever', 'watching', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'movie', 'entirety', 'Jungle', 'Fever', 'be', 'one', 'Lee', 'worst', 'movies', 'instance', 'one', 'nightclub', 'scene', 'see', 'are', 'mostly', 'Blacks', 'club', 'know', 'fact', 'most', 'clients', 'are', 'mixed', 'Black', 'White', 'Latino', 'Asian', 'etc', 'Also', 'what', 'period', 'was', 'Lee', 'setting', 'present', 'then', 'why', 'have', 'wear', 'Zoot', 'suits', 'was', 'fixture', ""'40"", 'most', 'objection', 'piece', 'business', 'Lee', 'put', 'film', 'was', 'inclusion', 'greedy', 'Jewish', 'clubowners', 'smacks', 'Anti-Semitism', 'put', 'injury', 'blame', 'used', 'Italian-American', 'often', 'used', 'brilliant', 'John', 'Turturro', 'gross', 'caricature', 'know', 'are', 'lot', 'Jews', 'do', 'own', 'clubs', 'NYC', 'have', 'also', 'been', 'been', 'beneficial', 'plight', 'musicians', 'Black', 'White', 'putting', 'benefits', 'cover', 'medical', 'expenses', 'using', 'clubs', 'ugly', 'example', 'Spike', 'writing', 'incident', 'French', 'woman', 'who', 'mal-treated', 'made', 'fun', 'musicians', 'club', 'struck', 'plain', 'mis-oygnistic', 'know', 'number', 'African-American', 'actors', 'writers', 'who', 'really', 'hate', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'One', 'female', 'writer', 'particular', 'told', 'conference', 'LA', 'when', 'posed', 'question', 'why', 'are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'Black', 'women', 'films', 'Lee', 'shouted', 'back', 'Shut', 'up', 'n', 'er', 'B', 'h', 'euphemism', 'female', 'dog', 'Now', 'Lee', 'continuing', 'slaught', 'Eastwood', 'saying', 'why', 'were', ""n't"", 'blacks', 'WWII', 'films', 'order', 'promote', 'war', 'movie', 'Anyway', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'digress', 'here', 'want', 'see', 'better', 'film', 'Jazz', 'then', 'see', 'either', 'Bird', 'Round', 'Midnight', '2', 'films', 'Lee', 'put', 'down', 'Perhaps', 'should', 'give', 'extra', 'star', 'excellent', 'Terrence', 'Blanchard', 'score-maybe', 'Spike', 'should', 'take', 'screenwriting', 'course', 'change', 'mind']",N/A

178133,APVNDUMOTRJ78,1558801871,E. Drake,"[0, 0]","With Lee's first three films, it is obvious that this man has a passion for music. With his fourth film, ""Mo' Better Blues"", Lee takes on this passion fully and it is a treat for us viewers and lovers of Jazz. Interestingly, this is a film about passion, that is the life of a passionate person. Like many prolific scholars, artists, and writers Denzel Washington's character, Bleek, makes everything secondary to his music. He is self-absorbed using two woman, both of whom he seems to love, only when HE needs them.  Anyone out there who has experienced a person like Bleek, whose every move revolves around his or her job, hobby or love, will appreciate this film.This is Spike Lee's first full-fledged dram. Generally I enjoyed this movie, though not as much as ""Do the Right Thing"". (I know, its always dangerous and rarely right to compare a director's films with one another, it's best to take them individually). I enjoyed how closely the music reflected the mood. the  pain as Bleek strained to play a year after he was beat up, the dizzying scene when he could not tell who he was in bed with and the scene when he was lying on the floor with headphones on and scattered albums all around him. I also was happy that Lee went full-circle and went ahead in time at the end of the film to show us how things turn out in the future. This is an very simple and often considered ""corny"" technique in film making, however I think it is underused and completes a story.A last thought, Spike Lee seems to develop one character in each of his films (in this film it is Bleek) so well, that the other characters seem of little importance.",4,"Toning It Down After The Great ""Do The Right Thing""",1206921600,"03 31, 2008",2008,1637,"['Lee', 'first', 'three', 'films', 'obvious', 'man', 'passion', 'music', 'fourth', 'film', 'Mo', 'Better', 'Blues', 'Lee', 'passion', 'fully', 'treat', 'viewers', 'lovers', 'Jazz', 'Interestingly', 'film', 'passion', 'life', 'passionate', 'person', 'many', 'prolific', 'scholars', 'artists', 'writers', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'character', 'Bleek', 'everything', 'secondary', 'music', 'self-absorbed', 'using', 'two', 'woman', 'whom', 'love', 'only', 'when', 'HE', 'Anyone', 'there', 'who', 'experienced', 'person', 'Bleek', 'move', 'around', 'job', 'hobby', 'love', 'will', 'appreciate', 'film.This', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'first', 'full-fledged', 'dram', 'Generally', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'though', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'Do', 'Right', 'Thing', 'know', 'always', 'dangerous', 'rarely', 'right', 'compare', 'director', 'films', 'one', 'best', 'take', 'individually', 'enjoyed', 'how', 'closely', 'music', 'reflected', 'mood', 'pain', 'Bleek', 'strained', 'play', 'year', 'was', 'beat', 'up', 'dizzying', 'scene', 'when', 'could', 'not', 'tell', 'who', 'was', 'bed', 'scene', 'when', 'was', 'lying', 'floor', 'headphones', 'scattered', 'albums', 'also', 'was', 'happy', 'Lee', 'went', 'full-circle', 'went', 'ahead', 'time', 'end', 'film', 'show', 'how', 'things', 'turn', 'out', 'future', 'very', 'simple', 'often', 'considered', 'corny', 'technique', 'film', 'making', 'however', 'think', 'underused', 'story.A', 'last', 'thought', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'develop', 'one', 'character', 'films', 'film', 'Bleek', 'so', 'well', 'other', 'characters', 'seem', 'little', 'importance']",N/A

178136,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,1558801871,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[0, 0]","This is among the most artistic and aesthetically brilliant films. Written and directed by Spike Lee, the film marked Lee's first collaboration with Denzel Washington who plays the fictional jazz trumpeter Bleek Gilliam. Also starring Lee and his regulars John Turturro, Giancarlo Esposito, Wesley Snipes, Joie Lee, Bill Nunn, and Samuel L. Jackson plus Cynda Williams, Robin Harris, and Charlie Murphy. Mo' Better Blues is a brilliant, passionate love letter to jazz and music in all of its chaos.I find this film rather cool and  sexy. Lee and DP Ernest Dickerson use the camera in the same way that Michelangelo used a chisel to transform ugly chunks of rocks into beautiful hands and feet. Spike and Dickerson always delight and amaze me with the way the use that camera - with their creative choices for the initial set-up of the camera angle in each scene, and then with the movement of the camera through the scene. And it's difficult to argue with the musical choices. If you like the music of John Coltrane, Miles Davis and Branford Marsalis, you are going to go nuts over this biography of a trumpeter who plays that kind of music with a quintet in uptown jazz clubs. I did being that I was unfamiliar with almost half of them. If you love New York City, progressive jazz/blues, and dazzling photographic presentation, this is your film, hands down.There is more to a movie than that. There is a script. storyline, and of course the cast which is wonderfully assembled. Beside the main cast there were nice cameos from Bill Lee, Flava Flav in the opening credits, and the late comedian Robin Harris as the club's top comedian. Other noted small performances from Charlie Murphy, Linda Hawkins, Zakee Howze, Leonard L. Thomas, and Abbey Lincoln are memorable while Samuel L. Jackson and Ruben Blades are excellent as the bookies with Jackson also playing the voice of Senor Love Daddy from ""Do the Right Thing."" Lee regular John Turturro and brother Nicholas bring humor as the fast-talking accountants bring some needed humor to the film. Dick Anthony Williams is great as the Bleek's caring father while Bill Nunn and Jeff ""Tain"" Watts are excellent in their brief roles as the rhythm section of Bleek's band. Cynda Williams is excellent as the seductive, hungry Clarke whose lack of attention leads her to having an affair with another man. Joie Lee is wonderful as the more mature, down-to-earth Indigo who seems like the only woman who can ground and confront Bleek and his ego. The great weakness of the film would be Lee's story is completely conventional. I didn't see anything new here that I haven't seen in earlier movies like ""Young Man With a Horn,"" except that the experiences are specifically filtered through the urban middle-class black experience.This is not an ""important"" film like the ones that made Spike Lee famous. It doesn't hammer away on social themes; there's no activism; there's no politics; there's no social injustice. There aren't any white villains. There aren't any white heroes, either. It is simply a story about a man and his surroundings. It must generally reflect portions of the middle class black experience, and it must specifically reflect some of Lee's own loves and hates, but there's no attempt to change the world, or even to remind the world that it needs changing. It's just a story about people who love jazz and New York City, told by a filmmaker who simply justifies that.",4,Spike Lee hit a good note on this film,1180656000,"06 1, 2007",2007,3434,"['most', 'artistic', 'aesthetically', 'brilliant', 'films', 'Written', 'directed', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'film', 'marked', 'Lee', 'first', 'collaboration', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'who', 'fictional', 'jazz', 'trumpeter', 'Bleek', 'Gilliam', 'Also', 'starring', 'Lee', 'regulars', 'John', 'Turturro', 'Giancarlo', 'Esposito', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'Joie', 'Lee', 'Bill', 'Nunn', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Cynda', 'Williams', 'Robin', 'Harris', 'Charlie', 'Murphy', 'Mo', 'Better', 'Blues', 'brilliant', 'passionate', 'love', 'letter', 'jazz', 'music', 'chaos.I', 'find', 'film', 'rather', 'cool', 'sexy', 'Lee', 'DP', 'Ernest', 'Dickerson', 'use', 'camera', 'same', 'way', 'Michelangelo', 'used', 'chisel', 'transform', 'ugly', 'chunks', 'rocks', 'beautiful', 'hands', 'feet', 'Spike', 'Dickerson', 'always', 'delight', 'amaze', 'way', 'use', 'creative', 'choices', 'initial', 'set-up', 'camera', 'angle', 'scene', 'then', 'movement', 'camera', 'scene', 'difficult', 'argue', 'musical', 'choices', 'like', 'music', 'John', 'Coltrane', 'Miles', 'Davis', 'Branford', 'Marsalis', 'are', 'going', 'go', 'nuts', 'biography', 'trumpeter', 'who', 'kind', 'music', 'quintet', 'uptown', 'jazz', 'clubs', 'did', 'being', 'was', 'unfamiliar', 'almost', 'half', 'love', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'progressive', 'jazz/blues', 'dazzling', 'photographic', 'presentation', 'film', 'hands', 'more', 'movie', 'script', 'storyline', 'course', 'cast', 'wonderfully', 'assembled', 'main', 'cast', 'were', 'nice', 'cameos', 'Bill', 'Lee', 'Flava', 'Flav', 'opening', 'credits', 'late', 'comedian', 'Robin', 'Harris', 'club', 'top', 'comedian', 'Other', 'noted', 'small', 'performances', 'Charlie', 'Murphy', 'Linda', 'Hawkins', 'Zakee', 'Howze', 'Leonard', 'L.', 'Thomas', 'Abbey', 'Lincoln', 'are', 'memorable', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Ruben', 'Blades', 'are', 'excellent', 'bookies', 'Jackson', 'also', 'playing', 'voice', 'Senor', 'Love', 'Daddy', 'Do', 'Right', 'Thing', 'Lee', 'regular', 'John', 'Turturro', 'brother', 'Nicholas', 'bring', 'humor', 'fast-talking', 'accountants', 'bring', 'needed', 'humor', 'film', 'Dick', 'Anthony', 'Williams', 'great', 'Bleek', 'caring', 'father', 'Bill', 'Nunn', 'Jeff', 'Tain', 'Watts', 'are', 'excellent', 'brief', 'roles', 'rhythm', 'section', 'Bleek', 'band', 'Cynda', 'Williams', 'excellent', 'seductive', 'hungry', 'Clarke', 'lack', 'attention', 'having', 'affair', 'man', 'Joie', 'Lee', 'wonderful', 'more', 'mature', 'down-to-earth', 'Indigo', 'who', 'only', 'woman', 'who', 'can', 'ground', 'confront', 'Bleek', 'ego', 'great', 'weakness', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'Lee', 'story', 'completely', 'conventional', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'new', 'here', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'earlier', 'movies', 'Young', 'Man', 'Horn', 'experiences', 'are', 'specifically', 'filtered', 'urban', 'middle-class', 'black', 'experience.This', 'not', 'important', 'film', 'ones', 'made', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'famous', ""n't"", 'hammer', 'away', 'social', 'themes', 'activism', 'politics', 'social', 'injustice', 'are', ""n't"", 'white', 'villains', 'are', ""n't"", 'white', 'heroes', 'either', 'simply', 'story', 'man', 'surroundings', 'must', 'generally', 'reflect', 'portions', 'middle', 'class', 'black', 'experience', 'must', 'specifically', 'reflect', 'Lee', 'own', 'loves', 'hates', 'attempt', 'change', 'world', 'even', 'remind', 'world', 'changing', 'just', 'story', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'jazz', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'told', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'simply']",N/A

178140,ABE8YHLYSM15G,1558801871,Luke Killion,"[0, 0]","""Mo Better Blues"" is a Spike Lee film from his apex of critical and commerical success in the late 1980's and early 90's. Like many other directors who established themselves with a string of hits, he utilized a little nucleus of actors who appear time and again in his films. Many other directors do this; Judd Apatow and Francis Ford Coppola come to mind. This is usually Hollwood at its finest, as a commercially viable product merges with a great ensemble group who share a common artistic vision. The chemistry factor is also very relevant here. In any profession, a group that clicks makes the end result much smoother and more seemless.In this film, the follow up to the New York classic, ""Do the Right Thing,"" Lee's cast includes Denzel Washington, (himself), John Turturro, Sameul L. Jackson, Bill Nunn (Radio Rahim), Wesley Snipes and Giancarlo Esposito (the most recent Emmy winner for his role in ""Breaking Bad). Washington takes the lead in his first role since the Oscar winning preformance in 1989's Civil War classic ""Glory"". It is clear he lived up the hype resulting from his big breakthrough with this portrayal of trumpter Bleek Gilliam, who heads the Bleek Quintet in their gigs in one of New York city's modern jazz clubs.Like most of Lee's movies, it is set in New York, and the city plays a large part in shaping the story. Many of the shots Lee uses are urban cinematography at its best, with authentic locations that give identity to the characters. It is clearly a New York jazz phenomenon, as the magic that Lee created between 1989 and 1992 owes alot to his knowledge of urban landscape. The jazz themes are ones that throw back to the Civil Rights era, which is another common denominator in his best work, all which explore the African American experience in late 20th century.Lee's statment about jazz is a conflicted one. He is obviously enamored with the mystique of Coltrane and Miles Davis, but as a director he is very conscious of the times he lives in, the story being set in the era it was made (1990). The genius that created jazz also exposed many dangerous character flaws in some of its most eccentric and driven artists. Sometimes, they become so wrapped up in their art, they were oblivious of what is going on around them. They suffer for their music, often resulting in precarious situations that run out of control.Bleek and his booking agent Giant (Lee) try to navigate the waters of jazz in the modern era, blending tradition and innovation with a commerical viability that is exemplary of compromise in the music business. The conclusion for this film serves a cautionary note; to be a contemporary jazz musician is full of uncertainty, and things can unravel fast without a careful approach. Lee gives his characters alot of heart, and manages to contemporize an art form that many considered passe in the 90's.",4,Spike Lee's modern jazz drama,1350259200,"10 15, 2012",2012,2864,"['Mo', 'Better', 'Blues', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'film', 'apex', 'critical', 'commerical', 'success', 'late', '1980', 'early', '90', 'many', 'other', 'directors', 'who', 'established', 'string', 'hits', 'utilized', 'little', 'nucleus', 'actors', 'who', 'appear', 'time', 'again', 'films', 'Many', 'other', 'directors', 'do', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'come', 'mind', 'usually', 'Hollwood', 'finest', 'commercially', 'viable', 'product', 'merges', 'great', 'ensemble', 'group', 'who', 'share', 'common', 'artistic', 'vision', 'chemistry', 'factor', 'also', 'very', 'relevant', 'here', 'profession', 'group', 'end', 'result', 'much', 'smoother', 'more', 'seemless.In', 'film', 'follow', 'up', 'New', 'York', 'classic', 'Do', 'Right', 'Thing', 'Lee', 'cast', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'John', 'Turturro', 'Sameul', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Bill', 'Nunn', 'Radio', 'Rahim', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'Giancarlo', 'Esposito', 'most', 'recent', 'Emmy', 'winner', 'role', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'Washington', 'lead', 'first', 'role', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'preformance', '1989', 'Civil', 'War', 'classic', 'Glory', 'clear', 'lived', 'up', 'hype', 'resulting', 'big', 'breakthrough', 'portrayal', 'trumpter', 'Bleek', 'Gilliam', 'who', 'Bleek', 'Quintet', 'gigs', 'one', 'New', 'York', 'city', 'modern', 'jazz', 'clubs.Like', 'most', 'Lee', 'movies', 'set', 'New', 'York', 'city', 'large', 'part', 'shaping', 'story', 'Many', 'shots', 'Lee', 'uses', 'are', 'urban', 'cinematography', 'best', 'authentic', 'locations', 'give', 'identity', 'characters', 'clearly', 'New', 'York', 'jazz', 'phenomenon', 'magic', 'Lee', 'created', '1989', '1992', 'owes', 'alot', 'knowledge', 'urban', 'landscape', 'jazz', 'themes', 'are', 'ones', 'throw', 'back', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'era', 'common', 'denominator', 'best', 'work', 'explore', 'African', 'American', 'experience', 'late', '20th', 'century.Lee', 'statment', 'jazz', 'conflicted', 'one', 'obviously', 'enamored', 'mystique', 'Coltrane', 'Miles', 'Davis', 'director', 'very', 'conscious', 'times', 'story', 'being', 'set', 'era', 'was', 'made', '1990', 'genius', 'created', 'jazz', 'also', 'exposed', 'many', 'dangerous', 'character', 'flaws', 'most', 'eccentric', 'driven', 'artists', 'Sometimes', 'become', 'so', 'wrapped', 'up', 'art', 'were', 'oblivious', 'what', 'going', 'suffer', 'music', 'often', 'resulting', 'precarious', 'situations', 'run', 'control.Bleek', 'booking', 'agent', 'Giant', 'Lee', 'try', 'navigate', 'waters', 'jazz', 'modern', 'era', 'blending', 'tradition', 'innovation', 'commerical', 'viability', 'exemplary', 'compromise', 'music', 'business', 'conclusion', 'film', 'cautionary', 'note', 'be', 'contemporary', 'jazz', 'musician', 'full', 'uncertainty', 'things', 'can', 'unravel', 'fast', 'careful', 'approach', 'Lee', 'characters', 'alot', 'heart', 'contemporize', 'art', 'form', 'many', 'considered', 'passe', '90']",N/A

Denzel is a little on the flat side in this one, this isn't a Malcolm X or Training Day performance for him.  Wesley is wonderful.  No action hero [stuff], just a great acting job.

His portrayal of man whose first love is his saxaphone and his second love is divided by Cynda Williams and Joie Lee. Wesley Snipes is great in this movie as Bleek's musical rival. I love the tension is played out between them. There is no question that there is an intense rivalry but when the going gets rough, rivalry gets put down for brotherhood.

Mo' better blues is about a brilliant musician  battling his inner  and outer demons. It's also a love story of sorts. Denzel Washington once again gives and effortless  performance as Bleek Gilliam the talented and tourchred musician. Fine  support work comes from Wesley Snipes, Newcomer Cynda Williams and Joi Lee.  Once again veteren Cinematographey Ernest Dickerson shines his brillian  photography.The score by Terence Blanchard is also excellent. Like I said  this is my favorite Spike Lee movie. This may not be spikes best work (do  the right thing) but this is the first film where spike seeems most  comfortable behind the camera. MO better has a real 'im a porfessional'look  to it.
