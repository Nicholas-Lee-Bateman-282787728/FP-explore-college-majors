He's not tough enough, angry enough, drunk enough, sad enough and -- perhaps most importantly -- certainly not funny enough.  None of Rankin's dry, stinging wit is anywhere in evidence here.  And I have to agree with the prior reviewer who said that the stories move way too fast, cramming too much plot into too little time.  At least they got Cafferty right, he's pretty much as I imagined him.  (Although just think what Brian Cox could do with the role!)  I'm off to check out the later Rebus series.

I have read most of this series and over time come to love the character of Rebus.  He is truly a 'real' person, with all the foibles and warts of each of us.  He is terrible at interpersonal relationships, and is at his best when he is doing everything in his power, not to show emotion.Though he did not write the screenplays, Ian Rankin was very much involved in the making of these teleplays (see the secion on the Making of Rebus for his comments), and you can see his deft touch in the minor changes that are made.  Siobhan Clark is supposed to be attractive, in her late twenties, with an Scots/English accent; the actress who plays her is none of these.  Brian Holmes is nowhere to be found, and neither is Dr Patience Aikens.  But the actors who plays Big Ger Cafferty and the 'Weasel' are spot on.Hannah as Rebus is able to show a great understanding of the character, who is as grey and tough as his home city.  My only complaint is that he is a little young for the aging Rebus who should be in his late forties.  A minor complaint.  Another is the plethora of Scots accents; it's hard enough trying to guess what some of the words mean, without trying to figure out what people are saying.  But, I guess they wanted authenticity since it was made for Scottish TV, and didn't care what us Yanks understood.

948698,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B000BRBAD8,Stephanie De Pue,"[4, 5]","The Scottish-made television series ""Rebus,"" filmed in that country and starring local boy John Hannah as the title character, made its TV debut in 2000.  It's based on the well-known series of the same name by Ian Rankin, who's now the most popular crime writer in the British Isles. Rankin is, of course, considered the founding father of the Scottish tartan noir school of mystery writing: a work that's darker and more violent than most, lightened, fortunately, by that grim Scottish humor.  Anyway, the show was released on video in 2006; it is a box of three DVD's that gives us the first four shows.It was the first of what has also proven to be a series of TV crime dramas, although further entries in the series star Ken Stott, rather than Hannah.  The production is set in Edinburgh, as are the books; however, aside from the briefest sidelong glances, we don't see much of that beautiful city beloved of tourists.  (Nevertheless, I went there a few years ago, and carved out for myself such a Rebus tour as time allowed; as I too am a rather longtime fan, and have read every one of the books save the last.)  There appears to have been plenty of money thrown at the screen; it believably portrays the life of a modern business city, with clogged streets, bridges and roads.  Cars, dress, housing and bars all look like the real thing.John Hannah, most of us know, achieved a lasting high-profile with his powerful funeral scene in 1995's ""Four Weddings and a Funeral;"" as it happens, I had first noticed him in the Glasgow-set ""Taggart"" series.  He sure is easy on the eyes, and I found him fine in the part; perhaps I'm not as demanding in this regard as a person of the other sex might be.  As to what Stitt, reputed to be a very good tv actor might do with it, well, I've no idea.As the first of the series to be filmed, the makers had their choice of books, and, as you might expect, they filmed four of the most interesting and powerful.  The first disk gives us ""Black and Blue,"" and ""The Hanging Garden.""  ""Black and Blue"" is about a previous serial killer still at large, dubbed ""The Prophet,"" and a copycat killer who's sprung up, dubbed ""The Disciple."" The novel won many awards, and helped to make Rankin's name: the plot's complex, and moves fast.  ""The Hanging Garden"" is particularly powerful, as Rebus's daughter is hit by a hit-and-run driver and seriously injured.  It also gives us a local gang war, a look at the illicit international trade in women, and a subplot about a World War II prison camp sadist who's escaped retribution, and gone comfortably to ground in Edinburgh.The second disk gives us ""Dead Souls,""an exploration of child abuse, and is a story that makes particularly good, resonant use of its setting.  The third disk is ""Mortal Causes;"" it, like the book on which it's based, makes really strong use of the city's little-known corners, and centers, as did the book, on a plea for racial tolerance.All four episodes are just crammed full of plot; and may be rather difficult for anyone not familiar with the underlying books to follow.  They also all neatly, perhaps too neatly, have the detective solve every case within the allotted time:  He also did so in the books, but that seemed less troublesome.  Biggest problem with this series in my house was the sound track.  On the second disk, we sometimes had the volume turned up to near 100, highest it's ever been, and still couldn't hear the entire dialog.  Furthermore, this is a recently-made and -released series: why oh why doesn't it have subtitles?  Even when the dialog is audible, the actors are speaking, as we agree they should, in that city's strong accent. These American ears would have been totally unable to follow the action, had I not previously read the books.  That really shouldn't be so necessary, and I hope the further releases, starring Stott, are a little more helpful in that regard.",3,Can You Dig It?

948699,A2Z13QAST1E7Q9,B000BRBAD8,"Tiggah ""the Anglophile""","[58, 60]","With wonderfully complex plots and recurring characters, Rebus is an absolutely first-rate crime drama based on the novels by Scottish author Iain Rankin.  Though set in Edinburgh, it is not the charming, picturesque, historic old city as seen by the casual visitor that we are privy to; rather, the viewer is taken on a journey through the dark, gritty, cankerous underbelly of what, on the surface, is one of Britain's loveliest old cities.  This is a series peopled by characters who are all too human, and it holds back no punches in its realistic portrayal of the criminal world.Detective Inspector John Rebus (John Hannah (McCallum)) is one of the most curious, indeed fascinating, DIs I've come across.  He's a competent and committed police officer, but a flawed human being with his own set of personal demons with which he must contend.  He's a deep, multi-faceted character for whom nothing is black and white, and he's not immune to making serious errors in judgement, to lying in order to achieve his objective, or to experiencing the temptation of a ""pact with the devil.""  He often makes decisions which shock the viewer, for we know that, even though we may understand his motivation, they are decisions which would never be condoned by the police.  Indeed, is it any wonder he drinks a little too much and has more than a little trouble sleeping?  Nor are we surprised to find that he has more than a little trouble forming and holding on to relationships with women.Rebus is a wonderfully rich, dynamic, and interesting character, and I personally felt that John Hannah did a superb job in bringing him to life.  I don't know why Hannah left the series or if he did any more series after this one, but I do know that I prefer these episodes and Hannah's portrayal much more than the recent pair of episodes wherein Ken Stott has taken over the title role (I just didn't warm to the character as portrayed by Stott).The set consists of four 100-minute episodes and a very interesting dvd extra on the making of the series, which features informative comments about the nature of the series and the character of Rebus by both John Hannah and Iain Rankin.In conclusion, this is a series I recommend unhesitatingly to fans of British mysteries and crime drama in general.  There may be less in the way of comic relief, but I would still say that if you enjoy shows like A Touch of Frost or Delziel and Pascoe, chances are you'll really enjoy this one.Highly recommended!",5,A Superb British Crime Drama!,1151107200,"06 24, 2006",2006,2484,"['wonderfully', 'complex', 'plots', 'recurring', 'characters', 'Rebus', 'absolutely', 'first-rate', 'crime', 'drama', 'based', 'novels', 'Scottish', 'author', 'Iain', 'Rankin', 'Though', 'set', 'Edinburgh', 'not', 'charming', 'picturesque', 'historic', 'old', 'city', 'seen', 'casual', 'visitor', 'are', 'privy', 'rather', 'viewer', 'taken', 'journey', 'dark', 'gritty', 'cankerous', 'underbelly', 'what', 'surface', 'one', 'Britain', 'loveliest', 'old', 'cities', 'series', 'peopled', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'too', 'human', 'back', 'punches', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'criminal', 'world.Detective', 'Inspector', 'John', 'Rebus', 'John', 'Hannah', 'McCallum', 'one', 'most', 'curious', 'indeed', 'fascinating', 'DIs', ""'ve"", 'come', 'competent', 'committed', 'police', 'officer', 'flawed', 'human', 'being', 'own', 'set', 'personal', 'demons', 'must', 'contend', 'deep', 'multi-faceted', 'character', 'whom', 'nothing', 'black', 'white', 'not', 'immune', 'making', 'serious', 'errors', 'judgement', 'lying', 'order', 'achieve', 'objective', 'experiencing', 'temptation', 'pact', 'devil', 'often', 'decisions', 'shock', 'viewer', 'know', 'even', 'may', 'understand', 'motivation', 'are', 'decisions', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'condoned', 'police', 'Indeed', 'wonder', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'more', 'little', 'trouble', 'sleeping', 'are', 'surprised', 'find', 'more', 'little', 'trouble', 'forming', 'holding', 'relationships', 'women.Rebus', 'wonderfully', 'rich', 'dynamic', 'interesting', 'character', 'personally', 'felt', 'John', 'Hannah', 'did', 'superb', 'job', 'bringing', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'Hannah', 'left', 'series', 'did', 'more', 'series', 'one', 'do', 'know', 'prefer', 'episodes', 'Hannah', 'portrayal', 'much', 'more', 'recent', 'pair', 'episodes', 'wherein', 'Ken', 'Stott', 'taken', 'over', 'title', 'role', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'warm', 'character', 'portrayed', 'Stott', '.The', 'set', 'consists', 'four', '100-minute', 'episodes', 'very', 'interesting', 'dvd', 'extra', 'making', 'series', 'informative', 'comments', 'nature', 'series', 'character', 'Rebus', 'John', 'Hannah', 'Iain', 'Rankin.In', 'conclusion', 'series', 'recommend', 'unhesitatingly', 'fans', 'British', 'mysteries', 'crime', 'drama', 'general', 'may', 'be', 'less', 'way', 'comic', 'relief', 'would', 'still', 'say', 'enjoy', 'shows', 'Touch', 'Frost', 'Delziel', 'Pascoe', 'chances', 'are', ""'ll"", 'really', 'enjoy', 'one.Highly', 'recommended']",Rebus
