1096419,A1EK0KJ1LLQB7L,B000UUX2YG,Amazon Customer,"[7, 11]","Return to House On Haunted Hill:  I guess with a title like that, there probably was no possible way you could end up with a GREAT movie, but considering the filmmakers apparently had access to some pretty cool sets, a decent cinematographer, a reasonably good special effects budget for a direct to DVD release, and an attractive, competent cast, they might've ended up with an okay movie at least.  But no, this movie is just plain bad.  It is, however, mercifully short, with the actual running time minus the credits clocking in at 75 minutes or so (though if you must know, there is a post-credits sequence, which will either elate you or depress you dependent on what you thought of the movie).  The filmmakers just seem to give up at the hour mark, which results in the least suspenseful conclusion I think I've seen in any movie like this.  The only cast member to return is Jeffrey Combs and all he really does is  appear and smirk menacingly every now and then before someone gets killed.  The plot revolves around the search for an evil statue that's supposed to be in the heart of the house, the location of which is hilariously literal, and therein lies the real problem:  Incredibly bad, unbelievably lazy script.  It includes all the kinds of cliches of the horror genre the Scream movies delighted in mocking:  Minorities die first (including an offensive death by...lesbianism?), people separate from the group and go off by themselves, somebody trips while being chased, etc., etc.  Oh, I won't even go on about this movie.  It's lame. Don't watch it.  Only the least demanding of horror fans will find something to like here.",1,"Mercifully short, at least",1192665600,"10 18, 2007",2007,1644,"['Return', 'House', 'Haunted', 'Hill', 'guess', 'title', 'probably', 'was', 'possible', 'way', 'could', 'end', 'up', 'GREAT', 'movie', 'considering', 'filmmakers', 'apparently', 'had', 'access', 'pretty', 'cool', 'sets', 'decent', 'cinematographer', 'reasonably', 'good', 'special', 'effects', 'budget', 'direct', 'DVD', 'release', 'attractive', 'competent', 'cast', 'might', ""'ve"", 'ended', 'up', 'okay', 'movie', 'least', 'movie', 'just', 'plain', 'bad', 'however', 'mercifully', 'short', 'actual', 'running', 'time', 'credits', 'clocking', '75', 'minutes', 'so', 'must', 'know', 'post-credits', 'sequence', 'will', 'either', 'elate', 'depress', 'dependent', 'what', 'thought', 'movie', 'filmmakers', 'just', 'seem', 'give', 'up', 'hour', 'mark', 'results', 'least', 'suspenseful', 'conclusion', 'think', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'only', 'cast', 'member', 'return', 'Jeffrey', 'Combs', 'really', 'appear', 'smirk', 'menacingly', 'now', 'then', 'someone', 'killed', 'plot', 'search', 'evil', 'statue', 'supposed', 'be', 'heart', 'house', 'location', 'hilariously', 'literal', 'therein', 'real', 'problem', 'Incredibly', 'bad', 'unbelievably', 'lazy', 'script', 'kinds', 'cliches', 'horror', 'Scream', 'movies', 'delighted', 'mocking', 'Minorities', 'die', 'first', 'including', 'offensive', 'death', 'lesbianism', 'people', 'separate', 'group', 'go', 'off', 'somebody', 'trips', 'being', 'chased', 'etc.', 'etc', 'Oh', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'go', 'movie', 'lame', 'Do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'Only', 'least', 'demanding', 'horror', 'fans', 'will', 'find', 'something', 'like', 'here']",N/A

A bunch of characters walking very slowly around a haunted house, flashlights in their hands, yapping on to each other and occassionally someone dies.There are many cliches in this film, here are some of them:-Haunted house is shown at night, therefore dark and supposedly spooky.-Every single death relies on lots of blood except for one, and the blood looks like red drinking punch you'd find at a teenage party.-Not much emotion shown from the characters. When one of them dies they are happy to just gawk at the blood and even stand in it whilst they mumble on about whatever stupid trite conversation they're having next.-Very bad acting all around. Falling into a tub of freezing water with dead bodies floating in it they may as well have fallen into a swimming pool with inner tubes floating there for all the fear they had on their face.-Scary asylum women all have black hair and black mascara to give a gothic effect to show 'darkness' of their soul (anyone would be scary if they were going to kill you, you don't have to stereotype everything up)A really lame effort.

It's a horror movie, full stop. You're not going to learn the lesson of life from it, or will be thinking about it after the credits have rolled, but it uses up some time. What is even more fun is that on the blu ray and hd versions of the movie, you can play the movie your way - choosing the fate of the characters etc, something I'd only previously seen on the third Final Destination movie.Apparently, this had 96 different ways of playing the movie. It's quite funny as the first option is right near the start, but then there's not another one for quite a while - but I suppose it depends on which option you choose. The options are yes or no, but there is a time limit (a syringe with the plunger going down), so you have to choose fast. I always wonder if there's an option you can choose that will finish the film well before it's time - we managed to do it, but it was roughly about half way through at the time.The good thing about this is you can make the film last as long or as short as you want. It does get a bit annoying trying to choose the options and some of them don't come out with the results you want. (For example, you choose to save a character, and they die anyway.)There's not much of a storyline. It's a good follow up to the original, but the storyline is pretty much average. Did they deliberately set out to make the audience hate the characters? The gore is pretty good, including a rather pretty girl getting her face sliced off (plastic surgery at its best?), and one guy getting pulled to pieces - literally. It's enough to make my stomach turn anyway.The ending was a bit of a surprise, and not totally expected. It's also quite sad in a way, if you consider what happens earlier in the movie. I won't reveal anything more you just have to watch it for yourself.Overall, Return To House On Haunted Hill is one of those movies that will be really cheap, really soon, and is worthwhile getting, even if it's just for the opportunity to have fun with the play the movie your way option.

The movie picks up with Ariel (Amanda Righetti), the sister of survivor Sara (Ali Larter, who is not here, but played the part in the first film, which was a 1999 remake that was a surprisingly enjoyable guilty pleasure), getting news of her sister's suicide, and thus embarks on a trip to said house to learn the truth behind her sister losing her mind, or something to that effect, maybe.  The storyline doesn't exactly make sense (you may remember that Sara wasn't the only survivor of the house, and she did make off with a good deal of cash), but that's not why we're here.  We are here to be thrilled and chilled, and Return to House on Haunted Hill does quite little in both departments.  There are some moments of blood letting, but the CGI generated gore effects are laughable, and the overall film is a quick running yawn-fest.  Modern B-movie horror queen Cerina Vincent is here, as is the great Jeffrey Combs (Re-Animator, From Beyond) who returns as the evil, ghastly doctor of said house, but he's hardly around to elevate this crud pile any higher.

The film also really gets 3.5 stars.  I also thought the sequel to this film was done well since this time rather then just sending 5 people to a sanitarium where the ghost of a mad doctor and his patients trap anyone who enters and kill them.  The director decides to have a group of people (some forced into going) go out and retrieve a valuable statue from the sanitarium that poses' evil.  Basically in this film it ends up being the people who want the statue vs the people who were forced into the sanitarium by the people who don't want to leave the sanitarium with out the statue and really just want to get out of the mess alive.

1096449,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B000UUX2YG,Tim Janson,"[2, 3]","1999's ""House on Haunted Hill"" was released about two months after ""The Haunting"" which had a far bigger budget and received much more publicity. Despite that, ""House on Haunted Hill"" proved to be the superior film with much more atmosphere and scares and less of a reliance on CGI effects. Only two of the guests at Hill House managed to escape with their lives, one of those being Sara Wolfe (Ali Larter). Unfortunately The gorgeous Ms. Larter is not around for the sequel, only in character name. Sarah's sister Ariel is an exec with a magazine and learns the news that Sarah has committed suicide. Ariel is visited by an archaeologist looking for the Statue of Baphomet, an evil artifact worshipped by a cult in the middle ages. He believes the statue is located inside of Hill House and is looking for the Journal of Dr. Vannacutt, the doctor who ran the asylum.A group of thieves led by Desmond (Eric Palladino) are also looking for the rare statue and they take Ariel and her boyfriend, Paul, hostage. Now the archaeologists and his assistants (Michelle & Kyle) along with the gang of thieves, Ariel and all find themselves locked inside the monstrous house/asylum, searching for the statue while the spirits of the house begin hunting them down one-by-one. Naturally this comes about as they devise the wise strategy of splitting up to search for the statue. Even when one of his men is torn to pieces, Desmond still refuses to believe in the house's haunted reputation.The 1999 film wasn't great, but it had a creepy atmosphere that the sequel lacks. This film is much more visceral and in your face and far more gory. Some of the gore hound scenes include on of the thieves getting torn apart limb from limb and another having her face literally removed with a scalpel. Not subtle, but fairly effective.The cast is no comparison to the first film. That film had well known actors like Larter, Geoffrey Rush, Famke Janssen, and Taye Diggs...The most recognized name in the sequel is low-budget horror king Jeffrey Combs who reprises his role as Dr. Vannacutt and has exactly one word of dialogue in the entire film. On the plus side, Amanda Righetti (Ariel) and Cerina Vincent (Michelle) are great eye candy.The entire premise of the Baphomet statue is a little ridiculous. The ghosts in the first film killed the guests because they were all descendants of the staff that worked at the asylum. What their motivation here is anybody's guess although there is at least one who tries to help Ariel. The remaining survivors eventually figure they can escape through the asylum's sewer system and conveniently find the blueprints to the mammoth facility and evidently Ariel is an engineer as she is able to map out their entire route down to the basement and into the sewer grates...ok....Return to the House on Haunted Hill isn't a bad film, it's just not great. But there's some decent scares and gore and its worth a rent.REVIEWED BY TIM JANSON",2,WEAK SEQUEL,1194566400,"11 9, 2007",2007,2952,"['1999', 'House', 'Haunted', 'Hill', 'was', 'released', 'two', 'months', 'Haunting', 'had', 'far', 'bigger', 'budget', 'received', 'much', 'more', 'publicity', 'House', 'Haunted', 'Hill', 'proved', 'be', 'superior', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'atmosphere', 'scares', 'less', 'reliance', 'CGI', 'effects', 'Only', 'two', 'guests', 'Hill', 'House', 'managed', 'escape', 'lives', 'one', 'being', 'Sara', 'Wolfe', 'Ali', 'Larter', 'Unfortunately', 'gorgeous', 'Ms.', 'Larter', 'not', 'sequel', 'only', 'character', 'name', 'Sarah', 'sister', 'Ariel', 'exec', 'magazine', 'news', 'Sarah', 'committed', 'suicide', 'Ariel', 'visited', 'archaeologist', 'looking', 'Statue', 'Baphomet', 'evil', 'artifact', 'worshipped', 'cult', 'middle', 'ages', 'statue', 'located', 'Hill', 'House', 'looking', 'Journal', 'Dr.', 'Vannacutt', 'doctor', 'who', 'ran', 'asylum.A', 'group', 'thieves', 'led', 'Desmond', 'Eric', 'Palladino', 'are', 'also', 'looking', 'rare', 'statue', 'take', 'Ariel', 'boyfriend', 'Paul', 'hostage', 'Now', 'archaeologists', 'assistants', 'Michelle', 'Kyle', 'gang', 'thieves', 'Ariel', 'find', 'locked', 'monstrous', 'house/asylum', 'searching', 'statue', 'spirits', 'house', 'begin', 'hunting', 'down', 'one-by-one', 'Naturally', 'about', 'devise', 'wise', 'strategy', 'splitting', 'up', 'search', 'statue', 'Even', 'when', 'one', 'men', 'torn', 'pieces', 'Desmond', 'still', 'believe', 'house', 'haunted', 'reputation.The', '1999', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'had', 'creepy', 'atmosphere', 'sequel', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'visceral', 'face', 'far', 'more', 'gory', 'gore', 'hound', 'scenes', 'include', 'thieves', 'getting', 'torn', 'apart', 'limb', 'limb', 'having', 'face', 'literally', 'removed', 'scalpel', 'Not', 'subtle', 'fairly', 'effective.The', 'cast', 'comparison', 'first', 'film', 'film', 'had', 'well', 'known', 'actors', 'Larter', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'Taye', 'Diggs', 'most', 'recognized', 'name', 'sequel', 'low-budget', 'horror', 'king', 'Jeffrey', 'Combs', 'who', 'role', 'Dr.', 'Vannacutt', 'exactly', 'one', 'word', 'dialogue', 'entire', 'film', 'plus', 'side', 'Amanda', 'Righetti', 'Ariel', 'Cerina', 'Vincent', 'Michelle', 'are', 'great', 'eye', 'candy.The', 'entire', 'premise', 'Baphomet', 'statue', 'little', 'ridiculous', 'ghosts', 'first', 'film', 'killed', 'guests', 'were', 'descendants', 'staff', 'worked', 'asylum', 'What', 'motivation', 'here', 'anybody', 'guess', 'least', 'one', 'who', 'help', 'Ariel', 'remaining', 'survivors', 'eventually', 'figure', 'can', 'escape', 'asylum', 'sewer', 'system', 'conveniently', 'find', 'blueprints', 'mammoth', 'facility', 'evidently', 'Ariel', 'engineer', 'able', 'map', 'out', 'entire', 'route', 'down', 'basement', 'sewer', 'grates', 'ok', '.Return', 'House', 'Haunted', 'Hill', ""n't"", 'bad', 'film', 'just', 'not', 'great', 'decent', 'scares', 'gore', 'worth', 'rent.REVIEWED', 'BY', 'TIM', 'JANSON']",N/A
1096450,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000UUX2YG,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 4]","""Return to House on Haunted Hill,"" sequel to ""House on Haunted Hill"" made (or remade) in 1999, has decent production designs and photography, but ultimately doesn't have enough narrative skills to interest us throughout the entire film. Like the 1999 original, the new film has a lot of effects including gores (including the gory one of the ""operation"" scene which Jigsaw might love to see). I don't hate seeing them at all, but its boring story is another thing.In ""Return to House on Haunted Hill"" we see yet again characters trapped in the abandoned asylum ""the Vanacutt Mansion"" for the most unconvincing reasons - treasure hunting. Ariel Wolfe, fashion magazine editor and sister of Sarah, one of the survivors of the incident seen in the previous film, is kidnapped and forced to enter this dilapidated building where ghosts seem still roaming. Unfortunately you don't see Ali Larter or Jeffrey Rush here (though Jeffrey Combs reprises his role as the doctor). Amanda Righetti plays Ariel and she is not bad.Anyway, you will see Ariel and other characters including mercenaries, a professor and his assistant looking for a relic, etc, and some of them picked off one by one when they (unaccountably) refuse to stick together, according to the genre's tired clich&eacute;. This is where we need a better script because once they are locked in, we have to wait for the scary and gory moments to come, which somehow include lesbianism and nudity. It seems the characters don't know what they really want to do, getting out or staying in, but even these ghosts don't know what they are supposed to do.",2,Gory and Boring,1196208000,"11 28, 2007",2007,1604,"['Return', 'House', 'Haunted', 'Hill', 'sequel', 'House', 'Haunted', 'Hill', 'made', 'remade', '1999', 'decent', 'production', 'designs', 'photography', 'ultimately', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'narrative', 'skills', 'interest', 'entire', 'film', '1999', 'original', 'new', 'film', 'lot', 'effects', 'including', 'gores', 'including', 'gory', 'one', 'operation', 'scene', 'Jigsaw', 'might', 'love', 'see', 'do', ""n't"", 'hate', 'seeing', 'boring', 'story', 'thing.In', 'Return', 'House', 'Haunted', 'Hill', 'see', 'yet', 'again', 'characters', 'trapped', 'abandoned', 'asylum', 'Vanacutt', 'Mansion', 'most', 'unconvincing', 'reasons', 'treasure', 'hunting', 'Ariel', 'Wolfe', 'fashion', 'magazine', 'editor', 'sister', 'Sarah', 'one', 'survivors', 'incident', 'seen', 'previous', 'film', 'kidnapped', 'forced', 'enter', 'dilapidated', 'building', 'where', 'ghosts', 'seem', 'still', 'roaming', 'Unfortunately', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'Ali', 'Larter', 'Jeffrey', 'Rush', 'here', 'Jeffrey', 'Combs', 'role', 'doctor', 'Amanda', 'Righetti', 'Ariel', 'not', 'bad.Anyway', 'will', 'see', 'Ariel', 'other', 'characters', 'including', 'mercenaries', 'professor', 'assistant', 'looking', 'relic', 'etc', 'picked', 'off', 'one', 'one', 'when', 'unaccountably', 'refuse', 'stick', 'together', 'according', 'genre', 'tired', 'clich', 'eacute', 'where', 'need', 'better', 'script', 'are', 'locked', 'have', 'wait', 'scary', 'gory', 'moments', 'come', 'somehow', 'include', 'lesbianism', 'nudity', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'really', 'want', 'do', 'getting', 'out', 'staying', 'even', 'ghosts', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'are', 'supposed', 'do']",N/A
