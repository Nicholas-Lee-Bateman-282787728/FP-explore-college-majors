But if it is worth it just to have Johnny Cash performing live in the early days, then get it.  You will enjoy a particular one, ""Boy Named Sue.""It is shot in a Tennessee prison in 1977 and 60 minutes.  But also performing is Linda Ronstadt, Roy Clark and Foster Brooks, aka, the drunk.  Carl Perkins plays guitar with Johnny.The concert starts with ""Folsom Prison Blues"", ""Sunday Morning Coming Down"" and a little known song by Cash, ""Jacob Green"" based on a true story of a young man who committed suicide in prison.Linda Ronstadt sings ""Desperado"", ""You're No Good"", Silver Threads and Golden Needles"" and ""Love Has No Pride"".Guitarist Roy Clark performs a few also, ""Rolling in my Sweet Baby's Arms, ""That Honeymoon Feeling"". Foster Brooks does a five minute stand-up and sings an old classic ""Half As Much""Concluding the concert and back to Johnny Cash, doing ""Hey Porter"", ""Orange Blossom Special"" and the entertaining ""Boy Named Sue"".If it's worth it to you to have some hits of Johnny Cash...LIVE, then get the tape!A little note:  If you ever want to hear a tribute song to Johnny, get the humorous Shel Silverstein's ""Front Row Seat to Hear Ole Johnny Sing""  It is the best!  .....MzRizz",4,Deceiving cover!

He opens and closes the concert, accounting for about 20-minutes of the show, with the rest featuring other classic country performers.  That's the bad news, I suppose.  The good news, Cash alone is worth the admission price (""You get your money's worth the first 15-minutes, and the rest is free!"").  His closing set in particular is electrifying, showing Cash at the top of his game and obviously having a ton of fun with his performance.Definitely worth watching if you're a Johnny Cash fan.",4,Johnny Cash makes this video,1204675200,"03 5, 2008",2008,589,"['was', ""n't"", 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'do', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anybody', 'would', 'have', 'much', 'interest', 'video', 'concert', 'accounting', '20-minutes', 'show', 'rest', 'featuring', 'other', 'classic', 'country', 'performers', 'bad', 'news', 'suppose', 'good', 'news', 'Cash', 'alone', 'admission', 'price', 'get', 'money', 'worth', 'first', '15-minutes', 'rest', 'free', 'closing', 'set', 'particular', 'electrifying', 'showing', 'Cash', 'top', 'game', 'obviously', 'having', 'ton', 'fun', 'performance.Definitely', 'worth', 'watching', ""'re"", 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'fan']",N/A

The problem is that the disc also contains lengthy segments from Linda Ronstadt, Foster Brooks, and Roy Clark -- great performers in their own right, but I didn't buy the dvd for their portion of the show.  I bought it to see Johnny Cash.  The title of the dvd, then, seems misleading to me.  If you're looking for a full performance from Cash, this isn't it.  The dvd cover also says that the disc runs for approximately 60 minutes.

Johnny Cash's performances are all excellently executed, and his guests keep the flow of his &quot;show&quot; running at a nice pace throughout. Johnny Cash was wise to include his friend LINDA RONSTADT, who at the time was riding the wave of her near breakthrough Lp, &quot;Don't Cry Now&quot;. Already introducing her unique and powerful version of &quot;You're No Good&quot; onstage to her audiences, Ronstadt performs four of her classic selections with her superbly well suited five piece band, and it is she who is the focal point of the show. Visually enchanting, confident and mesmerizing as a &quot;live&quot; singer, Ronstadt's onstage presence remains that of a shy girl, but appears to enjoy her short time onstage.
