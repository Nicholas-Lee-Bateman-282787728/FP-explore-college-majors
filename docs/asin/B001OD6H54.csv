But pains me to say that I was dissapointed in this DVD.  It doesn't feature his best work, I'm not sure how this specific venue and the material used was selected to be his debut DVD- but it did not showcase his best work by any means.

His observations of human behavior at the present time (as opposed to when he was a young fellow growing up in what he terms a typical Italian household) are right on target and so funny that it is hard to catch a breath during his very active onstage delivery.  He manages to snare male/female interaction s in clubs ('Is it noisy in here?'), sex addiction clinics ('no single man would ever be in their meetings'), tattoos, the history of mall changes, shopping in grocery stores, discount stores, current dress, marriage, long term engagements - the list of items he 'doesn't understand in people' is long and takes over an hour of time.Maniscalco is a very funny comedian who does not find it necessary to make every running joke line off color or to sprinkle his dialog with overused expletives: his humor is grounded in those things that make us all laugh - ourselves and our behavior and reactions.  He has a strong future.
