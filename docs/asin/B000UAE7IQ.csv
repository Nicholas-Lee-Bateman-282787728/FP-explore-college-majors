1093885,A3NKRH3TJ4DPVI,B000UAE7IQ,Book Glutton,"[1, 1]","Let me begin this with a historical description to serve as introduction to the subject of this DVD.The main occupation of the Magi was their interpretation of things they considered divine. They principally dealt with the evaluation of dreams, visions and astronomical signs. Astrological interpretation was of special importance to them. The temple of Belus in the city of Babylon was in their care. In particular, they were advisors to kings and princes.Though Herod would have had his own court astrologers, he must have paid particular attention to what the respected Magian professionals from the east had to say about a newborn Jewish king. Their interpretations were especially sought out by prominent people because of the Magian influence in the royal courts of the east. In fact, the Magi were in such high regard in Parthia that some even became kings. Even the Magi who came to Jesus were also considered as being ""princes"" or ""kings"" in some early accounts. But when the Magi came to Jerusalem, they arrived to do homage to the new Jewish king and to give gifts to him. In the next century, Tiridates of the order of the Magi did the same thing when he visited the emperor Nero. It is no wonder that the arrival of such Magi caused great interest to Herod and Jerusalem.In explaining to King Herod why they came to do homage to the new Jewish king, the Magi said, ""We saw his star...."" The Greek denotes it wasn't merely ""in the east"" that the Magi observed it. [So, our version of Matthew's Gospel is accurate: ""We saw his star at its rising"" (Mt 2:2) or ""when it rose.""]Scholars realize that the Greek words employed by Matthew to record this event were the ordinary ones then used in Greek literature to describe the regular rising of the stars or planets. The plain meaning of the words suggest that the Magi had witnessed a ""star"" rise above the eastern horizon when making their normal pre-dawn observations of the heavens.It was one ""star"" that intrigued them, though it must have been in some unusual relationship or aspect with other celestial bodies. The Magi were so impressed that they made their long, difficult journey to Jerusalem with costly gifts to present to the new king. After hearing their account, King Herod and all Jerusalem were equally persuaded that the ""star"" was significant.What did they see?First, remember: the position of the planets and stars can be calculated with accuracy back through history.Computations, now used in planetariums, are able to show and explain what they saw. This DVD picks up there and does a fantastic job of it.",5,Exceptional!!!,1353715200,"11 24, 2012",2012,2584,"['Let', 'begin', 'historical', 'description', 'serve', 'introduction', 'subject', 'DVD.The', 'main', 'occupation', 'Magi', 'was', 'interpretation', 'things', 'considered', 'divine', 'principally', 'dealt', 'evaluation', 'dreams', 'visions', 'astronomical', 'signs', 'Astrological', 'interpretation', 'was', 'special', 'importance', 'temple', 'Belus', 'city', 'Babylon', 'was', 'care', 'particular', 'were', 'advisors', 'kings', 'princes.Though', 'Herod', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'own', 'court', 'astrologers', 'must', 'have', 'paid', 'particular', 'attention', 'what', 'respected', 'Magian', 'professionals', 'east', 'had', 'say', 'newborn', 'Jewish', 'king', 'interpretations', 'were', 'especially', 'sought', 'out', 'prominent', 'people', 'Magian', 'influence', 'royal', 'courts', 'east', 'fact', 'Magi', 'were', 'such', 'high', 'regard', 'Parthia', 'even', 'became', 'kings', 'Even', 'Magi', 'who', 'came', 'Jesus', 'were', 'also', 'considered', 'being', 'princes', 'kings', 'early', 'accounts', 'when', 'Magi', 'came', 'Jerusalem', 'arrived', 'do', 'homage', 'new', 'Jewish', 'king', 'give', 'gifts', 'next', 'century', 'Tiridates', 'order', 'Magi', 'did', 'same', 'thing', 'when', 'visited', 'emperor', 'Nero', 'wonder', 'arrival', 'such', 'Magi', 'caused', 'great', 'interest', 'Herod', 'Jerusalem.In', 'explaining', 'King', 'Herod', 'why', 'came', 'do', 'homage', 'new', 'Jewish', 'king', 'Magi', 'said', 'saw', 'star', 'Greek', 'denotes', 'was', ""n't"", 'merely', 'east', 'Magi', 'observed', 'So', 'version', 'Matthew', 'Gospel', 'accurate', 'saw', 'star', 'rising', 'Mt', '2:2', 'when', 'rose', ']', 'Scholars', 'realize', 'Greek', 'words', 'employed', 'Matthew', 'record', 'event', 'were', 'ordinary', 'ones', 'then', 'used', 'Greek', 'literature', 'describe', 'regular', 'rising', 'stars', 'planets', 'plain', 'meaning', 'words', 'suggest', 'Magi', 'had', 'witnessed', 'star', 'rise', 'eastern', 'horizon', 'when', 'making', 'normal', 'pre-dawn', 'observations', 'heavens.It', 'was', 'one', 'star', 'intrigued', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'unusual', 'relationship', 'aspect', 'other', 'celestial', 'bodies', 'Magi', 'were', 'so', 'impressed', 'made', 'long', 'difficult', 'journey', 'Jerusalem', 'costly', 'gifts', 'present', 'new', 'king', 'hearing', 'account', 'King', 'Herod', 'Jerusalem', 'were', 'equally', 'persuaded', 'star', 'was', 'significant.What', 'did', 'see', 'First', 'remember', 'position', 'planets', 'stars', 'can', 'be', 'calculated', 'accuracy', 'back', 'history.Computations', 'now', 'used', 'planetariums', 'are', 'able', 'show', 'explain', 'what', 'saw', 'DVD', 'there', 'fantastic', 'job']",The Star of Bethlehem

I am sure in person this presentation comes off better. I heard this DVD 2ce before actually being able to sit down and watch it. Hearing it was better only because the actual ""pictures"" of the constellations are not clear, his face is projected over what the viewer is trying to observe, it's boring to watch a man talking to some people in a small room. This could have been a much more enjoyable film; instead you are watching a lecture.I am grateful that Mr. Larson has shared what God's grace and benevolence has allowed him to re-discover and make available to us (THANK YOU!!) something that was edvident to many long, long ago, but lost to many generations. This is of course, not ""new"" information at all, but a new way of seeing a truth from the past.What I find most regretable though, is that as a Protestant, he has limited himself by not researching the Roman Catholic Church's great Saints, Mystics, and early Chuch Fathers. Some of his comments bear this out. An example even my kids picked up on was his misunderstanding of the book of Revelation (why would you attempt to impose a Scripture passage you admit you don't understand on to a constellation? that was a little strange-), Our Lady of Guadalupe revealed in the stars (Revelation 12)is clearly displayed in his own presentation but not mentioned, and the fact that the Virgin planet never ""becomes"" the Mother planet but REMAINS a VIRGIN planet.All that being said, I did buy a couple copies to give as gifts - to a few men who are hard to buy a Christmas gift for.

He describes how it is now possible to calculate the configuration of the celestial bodies going back thousands of years. He goes into a great deal of detail in attempting to squeeze as much informative detail about the Star from the Biblical account. In doing so, he has to rely a lot on inference.Unfortunately, some of his premises are questionable. For instance, he dismisses a comet as the Star of Bethlehem because a comet would herald disaster, and this would not be a fitting announcement of a Savior. However, comets, in ancient times, portended major events. The events themselves heralded by the comet could indeed be disastrous, but they could also be beneficial.The author claims that there is no evidence in meticulous ancient Chinese records of an obvious celestial event at the time. In actuality, there is. He is also quick to dismiss a comet or nova because, among other things, according to him, they could not ""stand over"" where the Baby Jesus lay.

However granted that I had high expectations; I thought the lawer-author could have drawn his conclusions somewhat more forcefully in the strict scientific and astronomical areas; but interestingly, that he should have pulled back somewhat, in the interpretation of scripture and prophecy.  How the the Third Person of the Trinity is related to the world, that is.  Not to say he is wrong, quite; but that his viewpoint, or perspective, might be slightly off.  Concerning the latter, and for instance, regarding the elucidation of Rev. 12: 1 - 6, the sun clothed women may well be a spiritual reality that is represented in the stars; yet I don't think the stars themselves are that reality, as he *seemed to intimate*.  Additionally, this was somewhat off point.Yet on the scientific (and for this film, really, the more important) end, I wanted Mr. Larson to knock the ball out of the park, so to speak.  And I believe he had the facts on hand to do it.  Yet he missed the opportunity, in that he did not present the matter as *convincingly and as strongly* as he should have.  This is the point; he could have been even more scientific, and pointed, in his presentation; and further, his facts lacked completeness, and scope.  For example: he could have provided us with various further information, such as what was the true magnitude of the star of Bethlehem, how rare is such an occurance, and a complete elaboration of its positioning in the night sky.  Though this still is a thought provoking film; and it may even be said that he proves his point; yet, it was a job that could have been better done, and as a result of this perceived lack of thoroughness, I believe it merely a four star video.",4,The Star of the Magi: An Astronomical Incident?,1323561600,"12 11, 2011",2011,1818,"['watched', 'nights', 'ago', 'now', 'impressive', 'thought', 'ended', 'up', 'proving', 'little', 'disappointing', 'However', 'granted', 'had', 'high', 'expectations', 'thought', 'lawer-author', 'could', 'have', 'drawn', 'conclusions', 'somewhat', 'more', 'forcefully', 'strict', 'scientific', 'astronomical', 'areas', 'interestingly', 'should', 'have', 'pulled', 'back', 'somewhat', 'interpretation', 'scripture', 'prophecy', 'How', 'Third', 'Person', 'Trinity', 'related', 'world', 'Not', 'say', 'wrong', 'quite', 'viewpoint', 'perspective', 'might', 'be', 'slightly', 'Concerning', 'latter', 'instance', 'regarding', 'elucidation', 'Rev', '12', '1', '6', 'sun', 'clothed', 'women', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'spiritual', 'reality', 'represented', 'stars', 'yet', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'stars', 'are', 'reality', '*seemed', 'intimate*', 'Additionally', 'was', 'somewhat', 'off', 'point.Yet', 'scientific', 'film', 'really', 'more', 'important', 'end', 'wanted', 'Mr.', 'Larson', 'knock', 'ball', 'park', 'so', 'speak', 'believe', 'had', 'facts', 'hand', 'do', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'did', 'not', 'present', 'matter', '*convincingly', 'as', 'strongly*', 'should', 'have', 'point', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'more', 'scientific', 'pointed', 'presentation', 'further', 'facts', 'lacked', 'completeness', 'scope', 'example', 'could', 'have', 'provided', 'various', 'further', 'information', 'such', 'what', 'was', 'true', 'magnitude', 'star', 'Bethlehem', 'how', 'rare', 'such', 'occurance', 'complete', 'elaboration', 'positioning', 'night', 'sky', 'still', 'thought', 'provoking', 'film', 'may', 'even', 'be', 'said', 'point', 'yet', 'was', 'job', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'done', 'result', 'perceived', 'lack', 'thoroughness', 'believe', 'merely', 'four', 'star', 'video']",The Star of Bethlehem

Check out additional reading at end of this review.It was not a conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter (as previously thought), but of Jupiter (King planet), Venus (woman) and the star Regulus (King star).  The conjunction took place in the sign Virgo (Virgin, & the seed of the woman), and lasted just long enough to direct the 3 Kings to Bethlehem.  By the time they found where Jesus was living, He was a toddler.  King Herod found out where the three Kings went, and sent soldiers to kill every child under the age of two, but Jesus and his parents had already fled.  I also learned that God created the twelve signs of the Zodiac (the Ancient signs---not the new, pagen ones), and that the constellation Virgo was the first constellation, and Leo (the sign of the King) was the last.The entire story of creation, birth of Christ, death of Christ, struggle with Satan, and Christ coming back as King is written in the stars.  This is the best kept secret in the world today.It is NOT ASTROLOGY!!  This is using astronomy to read signs God has placed in the sky to announce what God is doing on earth.  The ancients knew this, they knew astromony---everyone believed in God or Gods back then.  Since that time paganism has corrupted the 12 original constellations and the fruit of that corruption is ASTROLOGY (fortune telling) which is forbidden by God.I did some research on the precession of the stars (the movement of the constalletions over thousands of years), and found they move one degree about every 70 years.  That means it takes about 25,000 years for the constellations to revolve full-circle around the earth, and come back to where they originally began when God created the Sun, Moon and Stars!Recommended additional reading:  ""The Gospel in the Stars"" by Joseph A. Seiss, originally published in 1882, but available at Amazon.com;, and ""Enmity between the Seeds"" by Bill Cloud (billcloud.org), 2004.This video is packed full of so much meaty information on astromony, the original 12 signs of the zodiac, scriptural references, that I was not only spellbound, but had to watch it 3 times and take notes.This video is a MUST BUY!

What if you could go back in time and actually view the ancient skies at the time of Jesus' birth? This film attempts to answer the first question by doing the 2ND. Using state of the art software, the same as used by NASA and other agencies, it is possible to examine the skies of Bethlehem in the days and years surrounding the estimated date of Christ's birth. The stars and planets move in such mathematical precision that it is possible to project forward and backward with incredible accuracy using this software. That in itself is so amazing when you consider the 100 BILLION galaxies that contain 100 BILLION stars each. Each one has a precise orbit and path that never deviates. Is it possible for all this to be coincidence? What Frederick Larson, author, lecturer and attorney, attempts to show is that it was astronomically possible and indeed probable that at the time of Jesus' birth the Planets Jupiter and Venus converged into what looked like a very bright star to the naked eye. He lists the nine characteristics of the star outlined in Matthew and then shows how his theory satisfies all nine of those conditions. Does this prove the birth of Jesus or that He was God come in the flesh? No, but it is more evidence (not necessarily proof) as to the historical accuracy of the Bible and that the Bible narrative is not destroyed by science. If you are a follower of the one called Jesus, you will be encouraged and strengthened in your faith. If you are not, it will cause you to at least stop and consider the claims of this ancient, yet modern, story of the miracle of Jesus' birth.

1093936,A2JCYG8N1L8ZN2,B000UAE7IQ,Mickey,"[15, 82]","There are a great deal of issues that need to be addressed on Mr Larson's work, but let's just look at one, without even leaving the text of the bible.Matthew 2:9 says that the star preceded the magi, until it stopped over the place where the child was.Now, no matter whether you think the star was a comet, a supernova, a planet like Jupiter...a 'star' in the sky can't lead you to someone's specific house. It may lead you to a rather large area, but certainly not a tiny house.You may contend, as Mr Larson seems to, that the star didn't lead the magi to a specific house, but to the city of Bethlehem. But does that follow the reading from Matthew?Matthew 2:9 says that the star stopped over 'the place' where the child was. The bit question, then, is what is 'the place'? Is it Bethlehem, or the house where Jesus and family are staying? Since the verse doesn't say specifically, you have to look at the context of the surrounding verses to figure out what was indicated.Let's assume that it's Bethlehem. We could paraphrase verses 8 and 9 as  ""Herod sent them to Bethlehem...the star preceded them, until it came and stopped over Bethlehem.""  This doesn't make much sense, because verse 8 already has them going to Bethlehem. Now verse 9 has the star leading them to the city they're already headed to.Now consider if 'the place' is simply the house where they're staying. We could paraphrase it as  ""Herod sent them to Bethlehem...and the star preceded them, until it came and stopped over the house where the child was.""  This makes perfect sense as it reads.Now look at verses 9 and 10 together. Read them as if 'the place' is Bethlehem.  ""...the star...came and stopped over Bethlehem...and on entering the house...""  Wait a second, what house? All the sudden Matthew is referring to a house, implying he has mentioned it previously. (No, I haven't skipped over any relevant text, read the verses yourself.)Now read it as if 'the place' is the house where they're staying.  ""the star...came and stopped over the house where the child was...and on entering the house...""  Again, no explanation needed, it makes perfect sense as it reads.Put simply, Matthew's chapter reads much more naturally when you assume that 'the place' refers to the house where Jesus and family are staying, as opposed to the city of Bethlehem. And if it does refer to the house, that's something a 'star' is unable to do. Read it both ways, and decide for yourself.Also, if 'the place' is Bethlehem, consider this. They're following the star, it leads them to this city...and then what? They still have to find the house in a city of about 5,000. If 'the place' is a house, it leads them to a house, and they're done. The passage makes sense.Lastly, if 'the place' is Bethlehem, consider this. The first 8 verses mention 'Bethlehem' twice in narrative, in addition to twice in Old Testament quotes. Then all the sudden in verse 9, does it make sense to all the sudden refer to Behtlehem as 'the place where the child was'?As far as the rest of it goes...we haven't left the bible, and we already have a pretty major problem. We have another one when we consider that the consensus date for Herod's death is 4 BC, which if correct makes much of Mr Larson's argument invalid.My experience with 'evidence' such as this tends to unravel the deeper we look into it.",2,"Fascinating, but...",1230854400,"01 2, 2009",2009,3344,"['are', 'great', 'deal', 'issues', 'need', 'be', 'addressed', 'Mr', 'Larson', 'work', 'let', 'just', 'look', 'one', 'even', 'leaving', 'text', 'bible.Matthew', '2:9', 'star', 'preceded', 'magi', 'stopped', 'place', 'where', 'child', 'was.Now', 'matter', 'think', 'star', 'was', 'comet', 'supernova', 'planet', 'Jupiter', ""'star"", 'sky', 'ca', ""n't"", 'lead', 'someone', 'specific', 'house', 'may', 'lead', 'rather', 'large', 'area', 'certainly', 'not', 'tiny', 'house.You', 'may', 'contend', 'Mr', 'Larson', 'star', 'did', ""n't"", 'lead', 'magi', 'specific', 'house', 'city', 'Bethlehem', 'follow', 'reading', 'Matthew', 'Matthew', '2:9', 'star', 'stopped', ""'the"", 'place', 'where', 'child', 'was', 'bit', 'question', 'then', 'what', ""'the"", 'place', 'Bethlehem', 'house', 'where', 'Jesus', 'family', 'are', 'staying', 'verse', ""n't"", 'say', 'specifically', 'have', 'look', 'context', 'surrounding', 'verses', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'indicated.Let', 'assume', 'Bethlehem', 'could', 'paraphrase', 'verses', '8', '9', 'Herod', 'sent', 'Bethlehem', 'star', 'preceded', 'came', 'stopped', 'Bethlehem', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'verse', '8', 'already', 'going', 'Bethlehem', 'Now', '9', 'star', 'leading', 'city', ""'re"", 'already', 'headed', 'to.Now', 'consider', ""'the"", 'place', 'simply', 'house', 'where', ""'re"", 'staying', 'could', 'paraphrase', 'Herod', 'sent', 'Bethlehem', 'star', 'preceded', 'came', 'stopped', 'house', 'where', 'child', 'was', 'perfect', 'sense', 'look', 'verses', '9', '10', 'together', 'Read', ""'the"", 'place', 'Bethlehem', 'star', 'came', 'stopped', 'Bethlehem', 'entering', 'house', 'Wait', 'second', 'what', 'house', 'sudden', 'Matthew', 'referring', 'house', 'implying', 'mentioned', 'previously', 'No', 'have', ""n't"", 'skipped', 'relevant', 'text', 'read', 'verses', 'Now', 'read', ""'the"", 'place', 'house', 'where', ""'re"", 'staying', 'star', 'came', 'stopped', 'house', 'where', 'child', 'was', 'entering', 'house', 'Again', 'explanation', 'needed', 'perfect', 'sense', 'simply', 'Matthew', 'chapter', 'much', 'more', 'naturally', 'when', 'assume', ""'the"", 'place', 'refers', 'house', 'where', 'Jesus', 'family', 'are', 'staying', 'opposed', 'city', 'Bethlehem', 'refer', 'house', 'something', ""'star"", 'unable', 'do', 'Read', 'ways', 'decide', 'yourself.Also', ""'the"", 'place', 'Bethlehem', 'consider', ""'re"", 'following', 'star', 'city', 'then', 'what', 'still', 'have', 'find', 'house', 'city', '5,000', ""'the"", 'place', 'house', 'house', ""'re"", 'done', 'passage', 'sense.Lastly', ""'the"", 'place', 'Bethlehem', 'consider', 'first', '8', 'verses', 'mention', 'twice', 'narrative', 'addition', 'twice', 'Old', 'Testament', 'Then', 'sudden', 'verse', '9', 'make', 'sense', 'sudden', 'refer', 'Behtlehem', ""'the"", 'place', 'where', 'child', 'was', 'As', 'far', 'rest', 'have', ""n't"", 'left', 'bible', 'already', 'have', 'pretty', 'major', 'problem', 'have', 'one', 'when', 'consider', 'consensus', 'date', 'Herod', 'death', '4', 'BC', 'correct', 'much', 'Mr', 'Larson', 'argument', 'invalid.My', 'experience', ""'evidence"", 'such', 'unravel', 'deeper', 'look']",The Star of Bethlehem

For two millennia, skeptics, truth seekers, scientists and theologians have pondered the star of Bethlehem. The Bible describes unusual or even impossible astronomical events at Christ's birth. Was it a miracle or mere myth? This wonderful DVD from Stephen McEveety ( a producer who worked on The Passion of the Christ) examines Scripture, ancient writings, indisputable astronomical facts and more. He shows us nine specific features of the star recorded in the Gospel of Matthew, and how it established a date for Jesus' birth and death as well.

I've seen a lot of documentaries on possible phenomena that could have been ""The Star.""  This is the FIRST, which has me convinced!My only (mild) criticism is that the polish of Frederick Larson's presentation could use some work.  Some special effects might also add impact--although I admit that the simplicity of the format emphasizes the wow-factor of the information itself.Mr. Larson has done fascinating research--Biblical and historical.  Furthermore, he uses a commercially available (and scientifically accurate) program (Starry Night Pro) to run the solar system backwards through time to see the actual nighttime skies over the Middle East at the time of Jesus' birth.  You can buy the program and verify this for yourself.  I've had the program for years, but never did the awe-inspiring research, nor found the jaw-dropping conclusions he reached.The celestial conjunctions he describes (and shows) are 100% accurate.  The mathematics of how the solar system works do not lie.  His logical arguments on their meanings, based on historical research and astronomical symbology, are almost as difficult to assail.  The awesome implications of this material will have many shouting in excitement!  Interestingly, he also presents some similarly veined information on the date of Jesus' crucifixation which will also ""wow"" all but the most jaded hearts!Whether you are convinced by his conclusions or not, if you aren't stunned and awed by the material in this presentation, you haven't understood it!!!In my opinion, this documentary has a place in the home of every serious Christian.

This film details the journey of Frederick Larsen from his first moment of curiosity to his extraordinary findings - the coming and passing of Christ were both announced by the heavens.Using Starry Software, first century manuscripts, and the Bible, Larsen was able to ascertain the critical date of King Herod's death, a date that eluded previous investigators including Johannes Kepler; the nine characteristics of ""The Star""; and information on the blood moon which was mentioned by St. Peter at the Pentecost. Larsen carefully shares his evidence and makes an excellent case on how the heavens announce the birth of the Messiah, mark the arrival of the Magi for the first Christmas, and mark His passing with a lunar eclipse (the Blood Moon) on the day of his crucifixion.

He does not speak as clearly as an actor would but we can forgive him that. He also did not fully go over all nine of the criteria for the star.

Adams,"[1, 2]","Overall, I feel positive about this idea, and when I am about to review something I felt was worth seeing or hearing, I like to look at some of the one or two star reviews to figure out why others are not impressed. Same with things I didn't care for: I read a handful of five star comments to see if I can figure out what I'm missing. In my 13 years of experience as an Amazon reviewer, I've found that religious books or films draw the most extreme reactions, pro or con, and that's true here. Some of the negative folks did not like the fact that there were Roman Catholics involved in this production, or preferred scriptural references not chosen by the presenter. Some of the fans of ""The Star"" were just appreciative that something promoting traditional Christianity even gets made in modern times. We do not KNOW absolutely that Jesus lived or died exactly as the Biblical books describe, for they do not fully agree with each other about it. At least in this life, the exact truth remains a mystery in terms of what most of us consider hard evidence. The human mind is a wondrous and varied instrument: some never depart from the church of their parents, some run as far from that as they can get. Some decide that no serious relationship with ""religion"" or ""the divine"" is needed for their happiness or their future beyond this world. Others bounce from church to church, like me: Presbyterian until 20, Catholic until 40, spiritualist for three years, on-line Unitarian for six, now attending (but not truly believing) a religious science expression (NOT Scientology.) I've always been fascinated with the Jesus story and His enduring claim on the hearts of billions, yet ""worship services"" have always left me kind of bored: the hymns have too many repetitious verses, the sermons have little spark, the prayers seem forced. I have no better explanation for this other than that I am a lazy, bad person. But I have read hundreds of pounds of religious books, have owned dozens of Christian CD's, and ponder the so-called ""eternal questions"" more than is healthy. Watching ""The Star"" is a way of pondering one more spiritual mystery, and I spent as much time reading some of its reviews as I did watching the show. If you are ""not sure"" the Bible is literally true in every word and phrase, but might be true in some, and if you tend to believe that the bulk of the religions we know of are more man-made than God- made, yet you can't shake the feeling that life has a purpose beyond the physical and part of us lives on, you are a bit like me. And I am glad I watched ""The Star.""",4,"Subject deserves more time, and a more dynamic host...",1395964800,"03 28, 2014",2014,2591,"['Overall', 'feel', 'positive', 'idea', 'when', 'am', 'review', 'something', 'felt', 'was', 'worth', 'seeing', 'hearing', 'like', 'look', 'one', 'two', 'star', 'reviews', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'others', 'are', 'not', 'impressed', 'Same', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'read', 'handful', 'five', 'star', 'comments', 'see', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'what', ""'m"", 'missing', '13', 'years', 'experience', 'Amazon', 'reviewer', ""'ve"", 'found', 'religious', 'books', 'films', 'draw', 'most', 'extreme', 'reactions', 'pro', 'con', 'true', 'here', 'negative', 'folks', 'did', 'not', 'fact', 'were', 'Roman', 'Catholics', 'involved', 'production', 'preferred', 'scriptural', 'references', 'not', 'chosen', 'presenter', 'fans', 'Star', 'were', 'just', 'appreciative', 'something', 'promoting', 'traditional', 'Christianity', 'even', 'made', 'modern', 'times', 'do', 'not', 'KNOW', 'absolutely', 'Jesus', 'lived', 'died', 'exactly', 'Biblical', 'books', 'describe', 'do', 'not', 'fully', 'agree', 'other', 'least', 'life', 'exact', 'truth', 'mystery', 'terms', 'what', 'most', 'consider', 'hard', 'evidence', 'human', 'mind', 'wondrous', 'varied', 'instrument', 'never', 'depart', 'church', 'parents', 'run', 'far', 'can', 'get', 'decide', 'serious', 'relationship', 'religion', 'divine', 'needed', 'happiness', 'future', 'world', 'Others', 'bounce', 'church', 'church', 'Presbyterian', '20', 'Catholic', '40', 'spiritualist', 'three', 'years', 'on-line', 'Unitarian', 'six', 'now', 'attending', 'not', 'truly', 'believing', 'religious', 'science', 'expression', 'NOT', 'Scientology', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'fascinated', 'Jesus', 'story', 'enduring', 'claim', 'hearts', 'billions', 'yet', 'worship', 'services', 'have', 'always', 'left', 'kind', 'bored', 'hymns', 'have', 'too', 'many', 'repetitious', 'verses', 'sermons', 'have', 'little', 'spark', 'prayers', 'seem', 'forced', 'have', 'better', 'explanation', 'other', 'am', 'lazy', 'bad', 'person', 'have', 'read', 'hundreds', 'pounds', 'religious', 'books', 'have', 'owned', 'dozens', 'Christian', 'CD', 'ponder', 'so-called', 'eternal', 'questions', 'more', 'healthy', 'Watching', 'Star', 'way', 'pondering', 'one', 'more', 'spiritual', 'mystery', 'spent', 'as', 'much', 'time', 'reading', 'reviews', 'did', 'watching', 'show', 'are', 'not', 'sure', 'Bible', 'literally', 'true', 'word', 'phrase', 'might', 'be', 'true', 'tend', 'believe', 'bulk', 'religions', 'know', 'are', 'more', 'man-made', 'God-', 'made', 'yet', 'ca', ""n't"", 'shake', 'feeling', 'life', 'purpose', 'physical', 'part', 'are', 'bit', 'am', 'glad', 'watched', 'Star']",The Star of Bethlehem
