We learn that one of them is part of a murdering trio of maniacs. The non-crazy woman is tortured and killed by a bald guy wearing Drew Carey's old glasses. Then, a voodoo-type dude in a top hat buries the hapless victim. Next, another unwary female is lured into the clutches of baldy and company. We get to witness another violent death. Oh joy! Another burial. Then, a tarot card reading from a lady w/ a painted-on tan, a video diary entry by one of the homicidal kooks, then back to the mindless killing! BORDERLINE CULT is a &#34;rinse-and-repeat&#34; movie of nonsensical slaughter. Just three murderous weirdoes and the women they annihilate.

I have only turned off a few movies in my lifetime - and this is the worst one I've turned OFF. This dreck can't even pass for a movie.Shot with horrific camera skills, awful acting (?), and absolutely NO plot whatsoever, I must admit I don't think I've seen a more unsatisfying horror movie in my entire lifetime.I thought at the very least it would have some good gore, interesting deaths, even a simple plotline,  etc.  No such luck.  Now, I've seen tons of horror films. I mean tons. It is my favorite genre and I can't get enough. From Saw to Hostel, Argento to Romero, Jason to Michael Myers,  Frankenstein to Dracula, Fulci to Bava - I've seen them all, and enjoyed them all in their own ways, even the really bad, eye-gouging B-grades. But I cannot find one redeeming quality to recommend this crap.This director must be some kind of idiot.  I hate to talk so poorly about someone's work, but seriously, this is trash.  He needs to find a new job.  I heard his stuff is junk, and this certainly proves it. Sorry, dude.  And on that note, who produced this?  Wow. Money wasted, to say the least. The very least.The non-existent plot seems to be something about a bunch of women (420 or some outstanding figure like that) who are killed by a ""cult"" in some border town in Mexico, or was it Texas?  I've already forgotten.  If this is based on a true story then it is sad that THIS is the kind of movie that got made about it, when we have great movies based, even if loosely, on true events, with The TX Chainsaw Massacre leading the pack. Or how about the more recent Zodiac?  - great film.  Heck even that made-for-tv movie about Ted Bundy starring Mark Harmon was better than this!Anyway, this ""cult"" apparently is a sleasy chick who drums up business (bodies, I mean) for a Drew Carey look-alike to kill- and not even in remotely interesting ways- (From all I watched, he strangled a few women, and even that wasn't interesting! He got out pliers or a random sharp implement a few times, but we never actually see what he does with them, the women just end up somewhat bloody.) Rounding out the ""cult"" is some other freaky mexican dude who got the job of burying the bodies, pounding a makeshift cross into the ground, and leaving something of theirs (a t-shirt, a random boot) at the site.  Like the authorities (or anyone else for that matter) wouldn't notice 400 graves! Shallow graves, shallow plot. Maybe the movie got better after the first 40 minutes, if so, be sure to let me know!There is no use for this movie at all, not even to slide the dvd case under a couch to level it, seriously! Take my best advice and just say NO.  If I hadn't have rented this (thank god I didn't BUY it), I would have broken it into many small pieces just from the sheer agony of my time wasted.
