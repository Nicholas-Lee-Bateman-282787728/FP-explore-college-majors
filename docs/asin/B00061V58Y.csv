We've been using this video for as long as I can remember - maybe 20 years or so. We have it in VHS and I'm going to get it in DVD. I bought two VHS copies because I was so worried that something would happen to just one and didn't ever want to be without it! It seems so simple and obvious - and yet the gentle, systematic program that builds so sensibly and gently over time is just the best ever. Having had quite a few episodes of back problems - from acute to moderate - over the years, I can speak from experience with this video. It has been a lifesaver many times over. It is excellent and wise.",5,We Call It the Miracle,1159228800,"09 26, 2006",2006,655,"['household', 'call', 'miracle', 'video', ""'ve"", 'been', 'using', 'video', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'remember', 'maybe', '20', 'years', 'so', 'have', 'VHS', ""'m"", 'going', 'get', 'DVD', 'bought', 'two', 'VHS', 'copies', 'was', 'so', 'worried', 'something', 'would', 'happen', 'just', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'ever', 'want', 'be', 'so', 'simple', 'obvious', 'yet', 'gentle', 'systematic', 'program', 'so', 'sensibly', 'gently', 'time', 'just', 'best', 'ever', 'Having', 'had', 'quite', 'few', 'episodes', 'back', 'problems', 'acute', 'moderate', 'years', 'can', 'speak', 'experience', 'video', 'been', 'lifesaver', 'many', 'times', 'excellent', 'wise']",N/A

My back pain was the result of a bulging disc, herniated disc, pinched nerve....whatever you choose to call it, it is all the same. I've been to the doctor (pain meds), chiropractor (3 times a week for life please), surgeon (i can fix that with this little knife), physio (see me 3 times a week for life...again). Don't forget the good old steroid injection that only helps 50% of the people and will almost never fix what ails you.When I began these exercises, I could hardly move. I mean I could not do the vast majority of the moves from week one without some great deal of pain and discomfort. Go slow and do these properly. I am pain free and feel great. Sometimes that pesky disc wants to hit a nerve and just one week of these puts it back in place.The taping of this looks like something from the 70's that is going to break out into a porn film. Big hair on the ladies and mustaches for the men. Pretty funny. And the voice over sounds something like Hal from 2001. I keep on expecting him to ask me to reach into my pocket and give him money like some cult.I highly recommend this DVD. Looks like they quit making it and can only be bought used. I wouldn't sell mine for $1,000, it is that good. (I should look into buying the rights to this one).I would also highly recommend supplementing this with Pete Egoscue's &#34;Pain Free&#34; book.",5,Best Help For Your Back Pain Ever,1404777600,"07 8, 2014",2014,1396,"[""'ve"", 'had', 'DVD', 'number', 'years', 'now', 'My', 'back', 'pain', 'was', 'result', 'bulging', 'disc', 'herniated', 'disc', 'pinched', 'nerve', '.whatever', 'choose', 'call', 'same', ""'ve"", 'been', 'doctor', 'pain', 'meds', 'chiropractor', '3', 'times', 'week', 'life', 'please', 'surgeon', 'i', 'can', 'fix', 'little', 'knife', 'physio', 'see', '3', 'times', 'week', 'life', 'again', 'Do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'good', 'old', 'steroid', 'injection', 'only', '50', '%', 'people', 'will', 'almost', 'never', 'fix', 'what', 'you.When', 'began', 'exercises', 'could', 'hardly', 'move', 'mean', 'could', 'not', 'do', 'vast', 'majority', 'moves', 'week', 'one', 'great', 'deal', 'pain', 'discomfort', 'Go', 'slow', 'do', 'properly', 'am', 'pain', 'free', 'feel', 'great', 'Sometimes', 'pesky', 'disc', 'hit', 'nerve', 'just', 'one', 'week', 'puts', 'back', 'place.The', 'taping', 'something', '70', 'going', 'break', 'out', 'porn', 'film', 'Big', 'hair', 'ladies', 'mustaches', 'men', 'Pretty', 'funny', 'voice', 'something', 'Hal', '2001', 'keep', 'expecting', 'ask', 'reach', 'pocket', 'give', 'money', 'cult.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'quit', 'making', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'bought', 'used', 'would', ""n't"", 'sell', 'mine', '1,000', 'good', 'should', 'look', 'buying', 'rights', 'one', '.I', 'would', 'also', 'highly', 'recommend', 'supplementing', 'Pete', 'Egoscue', '34', 'Pain', 'Free', '34', 'book']",N/A

Since using I've only had minor flare ups every 3-4 years. Check with your doctor before using.However, after using for twenty four years I have developed a numbness in one leg which was diagnosed as an L4-L5 impingement. Physical therapy did not help but I discovered that if I discontinued daily use of these exercises the numbness went away. Unfortunately my lower back pain returns. So I now do the exercises about once every three days.",4,Been using this program for 20 years,1159142400,"09 25, 2006",2006,549,"['have', 'L5-S1', 'herniated', 'disc', 'program', 'recommended', 'orthopedist', 'worked', 'using', ""'ve"", 'only', 'had', 'minor', 'flare', 'ups', '3-4', 'years', 'Check', 'doctor', 'using.However', 'using', 'twenty', 'four', 'years', 'have', 'developed', 'numbness', 'one', 'leg', 'was', 'diagnosed', 'L4-L5', 'impingement', 'Physical', 'therapy', 'did', 'not', 'help', 'discovered', 'discontinued', 'daily', 'use', 'numbness', 'went', 'away', 'Unfortunately', 'lower', 'back', 'pain', 'returns', 'now', 'do', 'exercises', 'once', 'three', 'days']",N/A
