I understand he deliberately chose this most unsympathetic character among three parts offered to him in the film.  It proved a wise choice, allowing him the opportunity to turn in an atypical and substantial performance. Ms. Garson was resplendent in beauty and display of her charm and graces, along with what I felt to be a skillful portrayal.On a plot note, it is important to realize that Soames colluded with Irene's landlady to eliminate her piano students to force her to marry him, after being turned down repeatedly.  As her livelihood disappeared, one can understand a woman yielding to an obliging suitor. The avenues of female employment were very limited in those days.  She shared the fate of most women of the era, not being free to marry for love. Of course, this manipulative action on Soames' part indicates to the viewer his possessive and self-centered nature, as yet hidden from Irene, but plainly revealed with marriage.  It is easy to shrink with her from his pompous conversation and attentions, all of which were devoid of genuine loveTension certainly mounts as Irene's situation becomes more untenable with the arduous attentions of the niece's fianc&eacute;, the young architect.  We see her attempting to avert them, yet his persistence is weakening to her.  He is a much warmer and more welcome admirer, certainly compared to the odious Soames. It is indicated that he reminds her of an early life love interest who also appeared exciting and adventurous. Robert Young was perhaps not the most effective choice for the type he represented, but I felt Ms. Garson's responses made the difference there.  She was quite skillful in exhibiting the variety of feelings, along with restraint, which made up the emotional collage of the situation.Regardless of having lost two rather dashing suitors, the one in early life and now Phillip, Irene seems genuinely settled in with Jolyon, the steadying hand appearing at her pivotal moments.  We are left with a picture of two people not just resigned to a union, but establishing a deepening regard for one another.  As she says to him at the end, referring to Soames, ""He is so poor and we have so much.""  Of course, it's not finances that are referenced here.There is a rich and pleasing array of settings and attire. You find yourself wanting to pause the play in order to fully take in a room or a costume.

As a third generation, upper middle class, solicitor, who appreciates a good income, his collection of good paintings, and the interest compounding on his savings, he wants to possess the beautiful Irene (Greer Garson). He can marry her and own her time and body, but he can't quite get inside her head in order to achieve the intimacy he craves. Flynn manages to convey all of this without histrionics, but through a controlled and wonderful performance, which doesn't falter throughout the film. Flynn alone makes this a melodrama to watch more than once to appreciate his skill, not to mention his own physical beauty. Despite his exceptional good looks his cold manner allows us to understand why Irene ultimately rejects him.Based on John Galsworthy's book, ""A Man of Property,"" the script is surprisingly faithful and well written for a Hollywood adaptation of a classic novel. The production design is first rate, as if Cedric Gibbons had been born to execute it. The costumes are from the correct period and the Victorian bric a brac and gingerbread architecture make the audience understand Bosinney's (Robert Young) desire to streamline his building designs.Flynn's performance is so astoundingly good that he leaves the rest of the cast pale in comparison. Luckily, the cast is composed of great stars with lots of film experience such that the finished movie is really special to watch. I especially liked Janet Leigh as the young and naive June Forsyte. Although much more beautiful than leading lady Greer Garson, Leigh makes us believe that June, although lovely, is just too young and inexperienced to really fascinate the complex artist Bosinney for any length of time. Walter Pigeon is fine as Young Jolyon Forsyte, and perfect casting because of course we know that  Garson and Pigeon, a great screen couple, always belong together in their films. Henry  Davenport is a crotchety but loveable Old Jolyon, and the rest of the formidable Forsytes are very like the ""waxworks"" described in the novel.

306779,A1NTIRBM2X0OVU,6302308585,John &#34;Silence is Golden&#34;,"[1, 3]","After 1944 MGM with the exception of its magnificent musical productions lost its way when it came to making the big ""Prestige"" pictures that had been its forte from the mid 1920's thru early 1940's. MGM had purchased the the rights to film the Forsyte Saga in 1934 so they had 15 years to ""fine tune"" a worthy script - which this movie shows that they failed to do.Its main flaw is that by initially having Soames and Irene seeming to get on very well together {prior to their marriage} the film/script is not being faithfull to the novel at its crucial point. Irene should instintively shrink from Soames, always be uncomfortable in his prescence, grit her teeth whenever when she is with him - but because of the script /writing Ms. Garson barely shows any of this tension / angish except in a very muted manner. This of course spoils the whole effect / point of Irenes later loathing of Soames after their marriage and {for me} this ruins the films theme. But the script misses so much of Galdsworthy's nuance's and the ""drip, drip, drip"" of a marriage in slow disintergation.Compton Bennetts direction is uninspired he filmed the book almost as a straight stage play . Even the climatic scene of Bosinney getting run down in the fog is poorly done - it is to obviously filmed on the studio backlot with no exterior photography to add realism.However the worst mistake made is how MGM cast the principle players. Greer Garson was perhaps inevitable for the role of Irene, but she is too old, matronly and sedate and she doesn't project Irenes inner fires, frustration and pain except by too obivous facial mannerisms - which isn't good enough !! Walter Pigeon as ""Young Jolyon "" is too old and too stolid for the role of a struggling ""semi - bohemian"" artist. Harry Davenport as "" Old Jolyon"" is completely miscast - physically he is nothing like the solid, intimedating, physially imposing patriarch of the Forsyte clan. Errol Flynn makes a brave stab playing Soames and phyiscally is right but he isn't quite able to pull it off most likely due to the poor script.Janet Leigh actually does well in the role of June but paradoxically she is so young and scrumcious- looking that she highlights the serious age issues 'vis a vie"" the rest of the cast. Despite her youth and relative inexperience, she actually looks like the Galdsworthy's description of Irene in the novel and I think she would have been a better choice than the 44 year old Ms. Garson.But it is the mis-casting of Robert Young as Phillip Bosinney that is the worst mistake - he is 12 - 18 years too old for the part, not particuliary attractive, earnest and as eager as a puppy dog in his pursuit of Irene but R.Young projects none of the intensity, sardonic manner or self loathing that Galdsworthy shows that makes Bossiney {in the novel} a compelling/dynamic man and Young's performance {not helped by the script} comes across as simply dreadfull. Why with a young Peter Lawford under contract did MGM not take a chance with casting him as Bossiney - he was the right nationality, age, appearance and with carefull handling could have done well in the role. Certainly he couldn't have done any worse !!MGM also could have been brave and cast Walter Pigeon as Soames - playing against his image and Ms, Garson's would have been a nice twist and he would have been as equally right in age, gravitas and appearance as Errol Flynn. But MGM in 1949 was a conservative film factory following {except in its musicals} standard, timid, formula movie-making.It seems that MGM just gathered together a bunch of contract players and tossed them into these roles trusting their star power and a lavish production would gurantee a qualitity production. To highlight how much MGM had declined in how it cast and scripted its prestige films, just compare this film to it's 1940 production of Jane Austens ""Pride and Prejudice"" also starring Greer Garson. Perfectly cast, superb production values with a witty and literate script, a young and radiant Greer Garson as Elizabeth Bennett and incisive and smoudering Laurence Olivier as Mr. Darcy - this was MGM at its apex showing Hollywood how to do it !!MGM is my favorite studio of ""Hollywood's Golden Age"" so writing this harsh a review is not my norm BUT this film is a complete ""misfire"" at almost every level. I can barely give it a two star rating and that rating is primarily for the glorious technicolor, set decoration and the lavish costume design.",2,"Plush Production with a Poor script, Uninspired Direction and Mistcasting of Principle Players - Mgm in Decline",1298160000,"02 20, 2011",2011,4466,"['1944', 'MGM', 'exception', 'magnificent', 'musical', 'productions', 'lost', 'way', 'when', 'came', 'making', 'big', 'Prestige', 'had', 'been', 'forte', 'mid', '1920', 'thru', 'early', '1940', 'MGM', 'had', 'purchased', 'rights', 'film', 'Forsyte', 'Saga', '1934', 'had', '15', 'years', 'fine', 'tune', 'worthy', 'script', 'movie', 'failed', 'do.Its', 'main', 'flaw', 'initially', 'having', 'Soames', 'Irene', 'seeming', 'get', 'very', 'well', 'together', 'prior', 'marriage', 'film/script', 'not', 'being', 'faithfull', 'novel', 'crucial', 'point', 'Irene', 'should', 'instintively', 'shrink', 'Soames', 'always', 'be', 'uncomfortable', 'prescence', 'grit', 'teeth', 'whenever', 'when', 'script', '/writing', 'Ms.', 'Garson', 'barely', 'tension', 'angish', 'very', 'muted', 'manner', 'course', 'whole', 'effect', '/', 'point', 'Irenes', 'later', 'loathing', 'Soames', 'marriage', 'films', 'theme', 'script', 'so', 'much', 'Galdsworthy', 'nuance', 'drip', 'drip', 'drip', 'marriage', 'slow', 'disintergation.Compton', 'Bennetts', 'direction', 'uninspired', 'filmed', 'book', 'almost', 'straight', 'stage', 'play', 'Even', 'climatic', 'scene', 'Bosinney', 'getting', 'run', 'down', 'fog', 'poorly', 'done', 'obviously', 'filmed', 'studio', 'backlot', 'exterior', 'photography', 'add', 'realism.However', 'worst', 'mistake', 'made', 'how', 'MGM', 'cast', 'principle', 'players', 'Greer', 'Garson', 'was', 'perhaps', 'inevitable', 'role', 'Irene', 'too', 'old', 'matronly', 'sedate', ""n't"", 'project', 'Irenes', 'inner', 'fires', 'frustration', 'pain', 'too', 'obivous', 'facial', 'mannerisms', ""n't"", 'good', 'enough', 'Walter', 'Pigeon', 'Young', 'Jolyon', 'too', 'old', 'too', 'stolid', 'role', 'struggling', 'semi', 'bohemian', 'artist', 'Harry', 'Davenport', 'Old', 'Jolyon', 'completely', 'miscast', 'physically', 'nothing', 'solid', 'intimedating', 'physially', 'imposing', 'patriarch', 'Forsyte', 'clan', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'brave', 'stab', 'playing', 'Soames', 'phyiscally', 'right', ""n't"", 'quite', 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'most', 'likely', 'due', 'poor', 'script.Janet', 'Leigh', 'actually', 'well', 'role', 'June', 'paradoxically', 'so', 'young', 'scrumcious-', 'looking', 'highlights', 'serious', 'age', 'issues', ""'vis"", 'vie', 'rest', 'cast', 'youth', 'relative', 'inexperience', 'actually', 'Galdsworthy', 'description', 'Irene', 'novel', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'choice', '44', 'year', 'old', 'Ms.', 'Garson.But', 'mis-casting', 'Robert', 'Young', 'Phillip', 'Bosinney', 'worst', 'mistake', '12', '18', 'years', 'too', 'old', 'part', 'not', 'particuliary', 'attractive', 'earnest', 'as', 'eager', 'puppy', 'dog', 'pursuit', 'Irene', 'R.Young', 'projects', 'none', 'intensity', 'sardonic', 'manner', 'self', 'loathing', 'Galdsworthy', 'Bossiney', 'novel', 'compelling/dynamic', 'man', 'Young', 'performance', 'not', 'helped', 'script', 'simply', 'dreadfull', 'Why', 'young', 'Peter', 'Lawford', 'contract', 'did', 'MGM', 'not', 'take', 'chance', 'casting', 'Bossiney', 'was', 'right', 'nationality', 'age', 'appearance', 'carefull', 'handling', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'well', 'role', 'Certainly', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'done', 'worse', 'MGM', 'also', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'brave', 'cast', 'Walter', 'Pigeon', 'Soames', 'playing', 'image', 'Ms', 'Garson', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'twist', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'equally', 'right', 'age', 'gravitas', 'appearance', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'MGM', '1949', 'was', 'conservative', 'film', 'factory', 'following', 'musicals', 'standard', 'timid', 'formula', 'movie-making.It', 'MGM', 'just', 'gathered', 'together', 'bunch', 'contract', 'players', 'tossed', 'roles', 'trusting', 'star', 'power', 'lavish', 'production', 'would', 'gurantee', 'qualitity', 'production', 'highlight', 'how', 'much', 'MGM', 'had', 'declined', 'how', 'cast', 'scripted', 'prestige', 'films', 'just', 'compare', 'film', '1940', 'production', 'Jane', 'Austens', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'also', 'starring', 'Greer', 'Garson', 'Perfectly', 'cast', 'superb', 'production', 'values', 'witty', 'literate', 'script', 'young', 'radiant', 'Greer', 'Garson', 'Elizabeth', 'Bennett', 'incisive', 'smoudering', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'was', 'MGM', 'apex', 'showing', 'Hollywood', 'how', 'do', 'MGM', 'favorite', 'studio', 'Hollywood', 'Golden', 'Age', 'so', 'writing', 'harsh', 'review', 'not', 'norm', 'BUT', 'film', 'complete', 'misfire', 'almost', 'level', 'can', 'barely', 'give', 'two', 'star', 'rating', 'rating', 'primarily', 'glorious', 'technicolor', 'set', 'decoration', 'lavish', 'costume', 'design']",N/A

Trtek,"[3, 3]","This lifeless and sanitized adaptation of John Galsworthy's The Man of Property has a couple of redeeming qualities: Very nice costumes and on of the most nuanced acting performances by Errol Flynn, better known for his swashbuckling roles. I suggest you read the two-star reviewers of 09/06/06 and 02/20/11 -- they both hit multiple nails on the head. Irene's motivations are quite altered from the original novel and rendered in such a way that her actions become almost inexplicable. Robert Young is horribly miscast as Philip Bosinney. The Forsyte family as a whole is left off the stage far too much. However, although he doesn't quite pull it off -- in large part because of the rather bad screenplay adaptation -- Flynn comes about as close as anyone could in portraying the conflicted, flawed character of Soames. That performance is perhaps what makes this film watchable and at times engaging -- if you're familiar with the old television adaptation with Eric Porter or with the novels themselves, this also has the perverse thrill of watching a truly Bizarro rendition of a classic.",3,Flynn and the Costumes (in that order) are the Good Parts,1363651200,"03 19, 2013",2013,1093,"['lifeless', 'sanitized', 'adaptation', 'John', 'Galsworthy', 'Man', 'Property', 'couple', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'Very', 'nice', 'costumes', 'most', 'nuanced', 'acting', 'performances', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'better', 'known', 'swashbuckling', 'roles', 'suggest', 'read', 'two-star', 'reviewers', '09/06/06', '02/20/11', 'hit', 'multiple', 'nails', 'head', 'Irene', 'motivations', 'are', 'quite', 'altered', 'original', 'novel', 'rendered', 'such', 'way', 'actions', 'become', 'almost', 'inexplicable', 'Robert', 'Young', 'horribly', 'miscast', 'Philip', 'Bosinney', 'Forsyte', 'family', 'whole', 'left', 'off', 'stage', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'However', ""n't"", 'quite', 'pull', 'off', 'large', 'part', 'rather', 'bad', 'screenplay', 'adaptation', 'Flynn', 'about', 'as', 'close', 'anyone', 'could', 'portraying', 'conflicted', 'flawed', 'character', 'Soames', 'performance', 'perhaps', 'what', 'film', 'watchable', 'times', 'engaging', ""'re"", 'familiar', 'old', 'television', 'adaptation', 'Eric', 'Porter', 'novels', 'also', 'perverse', 'thrill', 'watching', 'truly', 'Bizarro', 'rendition', 'classic']",N/A

In the  Galsworthy novel, we only see the wife through Soames' eyes, but she is  made into the protagonist of the movie, with motivations noble enough to  suit tedious Greer Garson, who ends up yet again with Mr. Miniver, Walter  Pidgeon.

Bernabo,"[4, 4]","The less you know about John Galsworthy's novel ""A Man of Property"" or his entire work ""The Forsyte Saga,"" the more you will like this 1949 MGM movie by director Compton Bennett.  That is a shame, become Errol Flynn's controlled performance as Soames Forsyte is quite impressive and those who are familiar with the literary classic or the BBC mini-series versions will look favorably on his approach compared to either Eric Porter or Damian Lewis.  Soames is one of the more interesting flawed characters in literature, but is take the entire saga to lay him out completely and the script by Jan Lustig, Ivan Tors and James B. Williams with additional dialogue by Arthur Wimperis reduces it to a Victorian melodrama.""That Forsyte Woman"" was the first movie Errol Flynn got to make for somebody other that Warner Bros., and my understanding is that he had his choice of which Forsyte to play and picked the cold and ruthless Soames.  Apparently incapable of love, Soames marries the lovely Irene (Greer Garson), although his feelings for her basically amount to possessiveness.  But he has promised her that if there marriage does not work he will grant her his freedom.  Irene is then courted by Philip Bosinney (Robert Young), a young architect who is the fianc&eacute; of June Forsyte (Janet Leigh), the daughter of Young Jolyson Forsyte (Walter Pidgeon), who abandoned his wife for another woman.  To make things even more interesting, Soames hires Bosinney to build a new home to make Irene happy.It sounds complicated and it suddenly strikes me that the basic story here is comparable to ""Rich Man, Poor Man,"" in that the family's initial judgment between Soames and Young Jolyson as to which is the more moral man is completely wrong.  Pigeon turns in a nice performance as a man comfortable with being ostracized by his family but saddened by the loss of contact with his daughter.  However, Young simply does not cut a dashing enough figure for us to believe that Irene would really be interested in him, no matter how much hell Soames is putting her through.  There are a few moments where Garson's Irene actually seems worth desiring, but if we do not buy the passion between Irene and Bosinney then the tragic aspects of this story simply do not work.  The attraction here is an indication of what Flynn could do as an actor, even as Galsworthy's story is given a lamentable Hollywood treatment.",3,Flynn's performance cannot redeem this MGM adaptation,1113436800,"04 14, 2005",2005,2406,"['less', 'know', 'John', 'Galsworthy', 'novel', 'Man', 'Property', 'entire', 'work', 'Forsyte', 'Saga', 'more', 'will', 'like', '1949', 'MGM', 'movie', 'director', 'Compton', 'Bennett', 'shame', 'become', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'controlled', 'performance', 'Soames', 'Forsyte', 'quite', 'impressive', 'who', 'are', 'familiar', 'literary', 'classic', 'BBC', 'mini-series', 'versions', 'will', 'look', 'favorably', 'approach', 'compared', 'Eric', 'Porter', 'Damian', 'Lewis', 'Soames', 'one', 'more', 'interesting', 'flawed', 'characters', 'literature', 'take', 'entire', 'saga', 'lay', 'out', 'completely', 'script', 'Jan', 'Lustig', 'Ivan', 'Tors', 'James', 'B.', 'Williams', 'additional', 'dialogue', 'Arthur', 'Wimperis', 'Victorian', 'melodrama', 'Forsyte', 'Woman', 'was', 'first', 'movie', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'got', 'make', 'somebody', 'other', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'understanding', 'had', 'choice', 'Forsyte', 'play', 'picked', 'cold', 'ruthless', 'Soames', 'Apparently', 'incapable', 'love', 'Soames', 'lovely', 'Irene', 'Greer', 'Garson', 'feelings', 'basically', 'amount', 'possessiveness', 'promised', 'marriage', 'not', 'work', 'will', 'grant', 'freedom', 'Irene', 'then', 'courted', 'Philip', 'Bosinney', 'Robert', 'Young', 'young', 'architect', 'who', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'June', 'Forsyte', 'Janet', 'Leigh', 'daughter', 'Young', 'Jolyson', 'Forsyte', 'Walter', 'Pidgeon', 'who', 'abandoned', 'wife', 'woman', 'make', 'things', 'even', 'more', 'interesting', 'Soames', 'Bosinney', 'build', 'new', 'home', 'make', 'Irene', 'happy.It', 'sounds', 'complicated', 'suddenly', 'basic', 'story', 'here', 'comparable', 'Rich', 'Man', 'Poor', 'Man', 'family', 'initial', 'judgment', 'Soames', 'Young', 'Jolyson', 'more', 'moral', 'man', 'completely', 'wrong', 'Pigeon', 'nice', 'performance', 'man', 'comfortable', 'being', 'ostracized', 'family', 'saddened', 'loss', 'contact', 'daughter', 'However', 'Young', 'simply', 'not', 'cut', 'dashing', 'enough', 'figure', 'believe', 'Irene', 'would', 'really', 'be', 'interested', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'hell', 'Soames', 'putting', 'through', 'are', 'few', 'moments', 'where', 'Garson', 'Irene', 'actually', 'worth', 'desiring', 'do', 'not', 'buy', 'passion', 'Irene', 'Bosinney', 'then', 'tragic', 'aspects', 'story', 'simply', 'do', 'not', 'work', 'attraction', 'here', 'indication', 'what', 'Flynn', 'could', 'do', 'actor', 'even', 'Galsworthy', 'story', 'given', 'lamentable', 'Hollywood', 'treatment']",N/A

306787,A2A6GWP1ADFEQ7,6302308585,M. A Newman,"[7, 10]","I like Flynn, Garson, and even Galsworthy as much as anyone, but what were they thinking when they cast and wrote this movie?  First of all we are to believe that Greer Garson is going to leave Errol Flynn for Robert Young? Who would prefer Marcus Welby to Captain Blood?  Of course, we all know she is going to end up with Walter Pidgeon, anyway, but what woman in her right mind would choose Robert Young over Errol Flynn?I suppose that Robert Young might have the edge because Flynn, transplanted from his native soil of Warner Borthers to MGM, seems to think that acting constipated constitutes great acting. Flynn tries to pretend to be as materialistic as Soames, but you know in his heart of hearts he is longing to chase starlets at the Brown Derby or Maid Marian in Sherwood ForestOf course Greer Garson might be wondering what her motivation was in the first place. She is her usual pleasant self and it is difficult for her to come to grips with the character's ambiguities. In the book Irene marries Soames because her choices are limited and Soames loses her because he is unable to express his love for her.  In this version Soames cannot act because he is miscast and Irene is too caught up with maintaining a characterisitic upbeat atmosphere to notice.  Let's just say that Basil Rathbone (Soames), Lana Turner (Irene), and Errol Flynn (as Bosinney) would have made much more sense. Walter Pidgeon is perfectly cast as the decent Jolyon.Along with the casting mistakes poor judgement is shown in the script. The movie omits the rape sequence, although the characters behave like it happened just the same. Irene is suddenly and inexelicably wandering through the fog, apparently seeking to throw herself under a carriage for some strange reason. What has happened here? She has merely had a fight that scarcely rises to the emotional tempo of a wet tea bag and yet here is Mrs. Miniver bereft of all interest in life. One knows exactly what has happened if one has read the book, but the script writer appears to have lead a sheltered life.  Why Irene should long to be violently trampled to death can only be ascribed to the fact that she sympathizes with her husband's digestive difficulties and decides to end it all in an effort to appease these angry gods.  The only motivation she has is that she and Soames had a sharp discussion which is hardly serious enough to long for the feel of horses hoofs on oneself. In the Forsyte Saga TV series Fleur and Michael had quarrels like this usually every episode and no one started eyeing carriages in this peculiar way.Just as Irene wants to find that carriage with her name on it Bosinney decides to horse whip Soames (and being hit by the very hansom cab that Greer Garson had been previously intent on finding - a satisfying moment since he no longer is around to entice Greer/Irene!)In a twinkling of an eye Greer Garson runs off with Walter Pidgeon who she should have married in the first place. It would have been more gratifying to watch these two stand up to Hitler or discover radium or something equally noble than to see them bracketed by the miscast Flynn and Young. As it is they are able to put these two actors behind them and live together through at least two or three potential sequels.  Yes, this is the sort of movie they should not make anymore and thank God for that!About the only thing that can said for this production is that it avoids some of the excesses of the recent Masterpiece Theatre TV series which made the Forsytes richer and more ostentatious than royalty. One can thank one's lucky stars that one misses  the sight of Flynn purchasing Impressionist paintings vice the Old Masters that Galsworthy and Eric Porter's Soames prefers.

306791,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,6302308585,Simon Davis,"[9, 9]","Almost everyone would be aware of the two equally famous television adaptations of John Galsworthy's respected literary work ""The Forsyte Saga"", however fewer people would know of this first much earlier film version released in 1949 that covered the period dealt with in Book One of Galsworthy's masterpiece. Despite MGM's increasing financial troubles as the 40's decade brought great changes to moviemaking in general here they really pulled out all their old magic to create a ""typical prestige picture"", the like of which would have warmed the heart of the studios by now long dead boy genius Irving Thalberg. The film boasts the only meeting on screen of legends Greer Garson, who was still the Queen of MGM despite some box office set backs, and on loan out Warner Bros. idol Errol Flynn in a quite pleasing non traditional role. Despite their very different screen personas and personalities the pair mesh surprisingly well on screen and almost make one forget that this film was also another in the legendary teamings of Garson with frequent costar Walter Pidgeon. The MGM attention to detail is evident everywhere here from the lavish production values, stunning period costumes and a supporting cast the like of which is largely unheard of nowadays.In one of her last great starring roles at MGM Greer Garson plays Irene, a young piano teacher struggling through life who becomes the object of desire of well to do Soames Forsyte (Errol Flynn). Part of the elite Forsyte family of Victorian London Soames is expected to marry well and avoid ""golddiggers"", as are all the Forsyte's. Headed by patriarch Old Jolyon Forsyte (Harry Daven port), the Forsytes are expected to marry for position, money, and prestige none of which Irene possesses. Nevertheless Irene exventually gives in to Soames' persistent attentions as he is a man used to gettign his own way in all things. Soames and Irene enter into what amounts to being a marriage of convenience whereby irene is furnished with all the material conforts she could wish for while Soames has the woman he always wanted above all else. The years roll along and we are introduced to the other members of the Forsyte clan including bohemian artist Young Jolyon (Walter Pidgeon), long considered the black sheep of the family and banned from contact with the family including his daughter June (Janet Leigh), because he ran off with a maid after his wife's death. Irene encounters Young Jolyon at an art showing and begins to attempt to bring father and daughter together after such a long seperation. Irene however soon encounters her own personal problems when against her own better judgement she finds herself; no doubt as a reaction to her loveless marriage, drawn into an attraction towards June's suitor, architect Philip Bosinney (Robert Young). Philip is eager for life and free of the pretensions for power and position so evident in all the Forsytes however Irene sees the unhappiness that her involvement with him would cause to June and the family despite their mutual attraction. Philip however is determined to win Irene and when Soames discovers that Irene is going to leave him things come to a violent head with Philip being killed and Irene finally leaving Soames for good for the company of the man who was best suited to her all along, the affable Young Jolyon, who after he and Irene eventually marry finds great success in Paris as an artist.Many ""Forsyte"" purists may object to the modified elements of this memorable story presente dhere however on its own merits ""The Forsyte Woman"", stands the test as one of MGM's finest prestige productions from the late 1940's. It certainly provided Greer Garson with a welcome and indeed a much needed return to the sort of roles she played to perfection earlier in the decade. While her Irene in this film is no Mrs Miniver the two are familiar women that suit Greer Garson's acting style to perfection. The timing of ""The Forsyte Woman"", was also spot on coming as it did after the critical panning of her most recent efforts such as ""Adventure"", with Clark Gable and the disaster of the George Cukor directed ""Desire Me"", when Garson was badly needing another success to restore her position as MGM's top female star. Errol Flynn is a joy in his role of the repressed  victim of his own families ambition and his Soames is a wonderful illustration of the range Flynn was capable of displaying when given the proper role that challenged him. Despite being anatagonists for much of the time in the script he enjoys a terrific chemistry on screen with Greer Garson and here she has the added benefit of not just one but two leading men ideally suited to her in more mature Errol Flynn and of course with regular screen partner Walter Pidgeon. Happily Pidgeon and Garson end up as a married couple at the end of the story which keeps alive that wonderful tradition in their films together of always playing the well matched couple. Walter Pidgeon is perhaps not so central to as much of the action as he is in his other teamings with Greer Garson but he makes the most of his part with his always sincere and reliable playing and he makes an interesting contrast to the darker playing by Errol Flynn. The supporting cast as in all these prestige MGM productions is second to none. Robert Young finally gets th eopportunity to play a lively character after all the tuxedo'd characters he yawned through during the 1930's. As young June's fiancee and suitor to th eolder Irene he makes a great impression as the free thinking young architect who is not intimidated by the power or position of the Forsyte's. Janet Leigh and Harry Davenport as respectively the youngest and oldest members of the Forsyte clan also do good work with Leigh in particular as the young girl caught in a romantic triangle with her aunt showing the great promise as a dramtic actress that blossomed in later years. Another great strength of ""That Forsyte Woman"", is in its high production values boasting as it does authentically researched Victorian England settings courtesy of studio genius Cedric Gibbons, gorgeous costumes, and enough period flavour to really believe this story was taking place in England and not simply filmed in Hollywood. ""That Forsyte Woman"", is indeed one of the last hurrahs of MGM's golden era of no expense spared fine period dramas and by the end of the decade apart from the colossal production planned of ""Quo Vadis"", there is a very noticeable tapering off in production of these types of ""typical"", MGM period dramas.As an illustration of stuffy Victorian mores, behaviours, and family pretensions you can't really better ""That Forsyte Woman"" despite its playing around with elements of the original story. It is first and foremost the performances and production values that make this film a viewing experience to cherish, and they are a classic illustration of what ""old Hollywood"", under the studio system was capable of producing on an amazingly regular basis. Greer Garson, Errol Flynn and Walter Pidgeon were three of Hollywood's most popular and loved stars during the 1940's and here we have the opportunity for almost the last time at enjoy them in roles that do their talents justice. If you love period dramas in beautiful technicolour settings then dont miss ""That Forsyte Woman"".",4,Lavish MGM Period Drama With The Only Screen Teaming of Greer Garson And Errol

I always believed that his acting chops far exceeded the typecasting of westerns and swashbuckling roles on the high seas.  I realize that in his era, most actors were regarded as entertainers. A few brave, enterprising actors and actresses were able to wrest some sort of free agency.  Too bad  Flynn wasn't one of them.  Maybe he didn't realize that being a shrewd businessman or woman is part and partcel of being effective in any line of work.  He certainly possessed a superior intellect.  This movie hints at the tremendous range he evinced.  Critics are often dead wrong.  They didn't care for Bill Murray in &#34;The Razor's Edge.&#34;  They often object to any performer trying to do anything different.
