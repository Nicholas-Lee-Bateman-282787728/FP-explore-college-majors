925119,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B000AAD8HM,Alistair McHarg,"[8, 9]","From the very beginning, Homicide - Life On The Street was just flat out better than 97% of what's available on TV, including cable.  The impetus, of course, was Barry Levinson, a truly brilliant director with numerous great films to his credit.  (His overriding love of Baltimore's gritty reality contributed enormously.)  Levinson's approach set the tone for everything that happened later, a sensibility grounded in film, not TV, and ensemble acting, not formulaic story development.  Where Law & Order, as good as it is, is almost mechanistic in its style, with Homicide one always has the wonderful sense that anything might happen, indeed, that stories might be unresolved, or resolved in an unsatisfactory manner, as is the case in real life.Unusual camera work, and especially the choppy editing - which frequently featured multiple takes of the same scene - gave the show a hard-edged, urban appeal totally in keeping with Baltimore - the show's non-credited star.  (A welcome and refreshing change from the slick, smooth, and empty style of typical Hollywood pap.)  The writing was always excellent, terrific dialogue, fresh plot twists, well-drawn characters that evolved right before your eyes.  Homicide also featured a long parade of wonderful actors moving in and out of the ensemble, and terrific cameos as well; most notably Lily Tomlin whose performance in the episode called ""The Hat"" is perfection itself.Melissa Leo, Clark Johnson, and Max Perlich deserve special note for great work developing marvelously quirky characters, but the weight of the show rests squarely on the shoulders of Andre Braugher as Frank Pembleton and Yaphet Koto as Al Giardello.  Both men created such fully realized characters that everything they did, however improbable, was believable.  Braugher's Pembleton is as complex and interesting as any fictional figure you might ever find, and Koto as Giardello exudes male dignity, power, and decency in a way that is almost unknown in the wasteland of television, a landscape populated by imbecilic male role models.  About Belzer's Munch, what can one say except that Belzer may be the only person in show business history to spend an entire career playing one role, no matter which show he appears in. But then, Belzer is Munch, so does it really qualify as acting at all?I've acquired these in bits and pieces, now that the complete collection is available, I wish I'd waited; I would have saved a lot of money.  Highly recommended, this is TV at its very best, when it's so good that it's indistinguishable from film.",5,All The Best - All In One Place,1147305600,"05 11, 2006",2006,2567,"['very', 'beginning', 'Homicide', 'Life', 'Street', 'was', 'just', 'flat', 'out', 'better', '97', '%', 'what', 'available', 'TV', 'including', 'cable', 'impetus', 'course', 'was', 'Barry', 'Levinson', 'truly', 'brilliant', 'director', 'numerous', 'great', 'films', 'credit', 'overriding', 'love', 'Baltimore', 'gritty', 'reality', 'contributed', 'enormously', 'Levinson', 'approach', 'set', 'tone', 'everything', 'happened', 'later', 'sensibility', 'grounded', 'film', 'not', 'TV', 'ensemble', 'acting', 'not', 'formulaic', 'story', 'development', 'Where', 'Law', 'Order', 'as', 'good', 'almost', 'mechanistic', 'style', 'Homicide', 'one', 'always', 'wonderful', 'sense', 'anything', 'might', 'happen', 'indeed', 'stories', 'might', 'be', 'unresolved', 'resolved', 'unsatisfactory', 'manner', 'case', 'real', 'life.Unusual', 'camera', 'work', 'especially', 'choppy', 'editing', 'frequently', 'featured', 'multiple', 'same', 'scene', 'gave', 'show', 'hard-edged', 'urban', 'appeal', 'totally', 'keeping', 'Baltimore', 'show', 'non-credited', 'star', 'welcome', 'refreshing', 'change', 'slick', 'empty', 'style', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'pap', 'writing', 'was', 'always', 'excellent', 'terrific', 'dialogue', 'fresh', 'plot', 'twists', 'well-drawn', 'characters', 'evolved', 'right', 'eyes', 'Homicide', 'also', 'featured', 'long', 'parade', 'wonderful', 'actors', 'moving', 'ensemble', 'terrific', 'cameos', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'notably', 'Lily', 'Tomlin', 'performance', 'episode', 'called', 'Hat', 'perfection', 'itself.Melissa', 'Leo', 'Clark', 'Johnson', 'Max', 'Perlich', 'deserve', 'special', 'note', 'great', 'work', 'developing', 'marvelously', 'quirky', 'characters', 'weight', 'show', 'squarely', 'shoulders', 'Andre', 'Braugher', 'Frank', 'Pembleton', 'Yaphet', 'Koto', 'Al', 'Giardello', 'men', 'created', 'such', 'fully', 'realized', 'characters', 'everything', 'did', 'however', 'improbable', 'was', 'believable', 'Braugher', 'Pembleton', 'complex', 'interesting', 'fictional', 'figure', 'might', 'ever', 'find', 'Koto', 'Giardello', 'male', 'dignity', 'power', 'decency', 'way', 'almost', 'unknown', 'wasteland', 'television', 'landscape', 'populated', 'imbecilic', 'male', 'role', 'models', 'Belzer', 'Munch', 'what', 'can', 'one', 'say', 'Belzer', 'may', 'be', 'only', 'person', 'show', 'business', 'history', 'spend', 'entire', 'career', 'playing', 'one', 'role', 'matter', 'show', 'then', 'Belzer', 'Munch', 'so', 'really', 'qualify', 'acting', ""'ve"", 'acquired', 'bits', 'pieces', 'now', 'complete', 'collection', 'available', 'wish', ""'d"", 'waited', 'would', 'have', 'saved', 'lot', 'money', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'TV', 'very', 'best', 'when', 'so', 'good', 'indistinguishable', 'film']",Homicide The Complete Series Seasons 1 SET
925120,AYQP8XMHTG2YR,B000AAD8HM,Brandon J. Smith,"[0, 0]","Homicide: Life on the Street is my favorite show of all time. It's a 5-star show for sure, and I could go on and on about its brilliance. But the reason I'm writing this review is to warn potential customers: The Law & Order crossover episodes were NOT include in the single-season releases, nor was Homicide: The Movie, the follow-up tv movie that wrapped up the remaining loose ends. Though the L&O; episodes are the worst of the series (they were really just desperate attempts to get more viewers on board, though Jerry Orbach and Richard Belzer sparred well with each other), it's frustrating to ONLY have part II of three 2-parters. The issue had to do with securing rights to the episodes, which they didn't have when these dvds came out. They DID secure the rights in time for the box set of Homicide, so you would be much better served by getting that set (the one that looks like a little filing cabinet).*(*Footnote: When that came out, I ended up buying it and selling off my single-seasons through ebay. I was fortunate to have broken even, but I still haven't been able to sell the 7th season, since the existence of the box set made these individual seasons moot.)",4,Be Warned - Crossover Episodes Missing!,1241827200,"05 9, 2009",2009,1179,"['Homicide', 'Life', 'Street', 'favorite', 'show', 'time', '5-star', 'show', 'sure', 'could', 'go', 'brilliance', 'reason', ""'m"", 'writing', 'review', 'warn', 'potential', 'customers', 'Law', 'Order', 'crossover', 'episodes', 'were', 'NOT', 'include', 'single-season', 'releases', 'was', 'Homicide', 'Movie', 'follow-up', 'tv', 'movie', 'wrapped', 'up', 'remaining', 'loose', 'ends', 'L', 'O', 'episodes', 'are', 'worst', 'series', 'were', 'really', 'just', 'desperate', 'attempts', 'get', 'more', 'viewers', 'board', 'Jerry', 'Orbach', 'Richard', 'Belzer', 'sparred', 'well', 'other', 'frustrating', 'ONLY', 'have', 'part', 'II', 'three', '2-parters', 'issue', 'had', 'do', 'securing', 'rights', 'episodes', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'when', 'dvds', 'came', 'out', 'DID', 'secure', 'rights', 'time', 'box', 'set', 'Homicide', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'served', 'getting', 'set', 'one', 'little', 'filing', 'cabinet', '*', '*Footnote', 'When', 'came', 'out', 'ended', 'up', 'buying', 'selling', 'off', 'single-seasons', 'ebay', 'was', 'fortunate', 'have', 'broken', 'even', 'still', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'able', 'sell', '7th', 'season', 'existence', 'box', 'set', 'made', 'individual', 'seasons', 'moot']",Homicide The Complete Series Seasons 1 SET

Gritty, tense, loaded with action, characters that compel you to watch, plots that draw you in like bees to honey; and the amazing duo of Yaphet Kotto and Andre Braugher.  This show influenced crime drama on TV for years.The DVDs are sparsely populated with extras.  Every now and then, you'll see a bonus track about the music used or an audio commentary.  Later seasons include a ""previously on"" segment.After being engrossed through six full seasons, I was a bit shocked to discover that the last disc in Season 6 was bad.  After playing it on multiple DVD players, I managed to slug through it.  Could be an isolated incident.  Could be an issue.

925123,A3J029KBNG5MNP,B000AAD8HM,Mr. Bey,"[18, 19]","Homicide: Life on the Street is not only the greatest cop drama of the 90's, it's one of the best ever. It's authentic settings, great acting, and great storylines were what made it so great. Now you can relive the entire story through this DVD.Homicide did go through a lot of cast changes but those who stuck around really grew. If you look at Bayliss in the first season and then look in the seventh season, there's a big change in his character and that showed that the writers could show great character development. It was a shame though that Pembleton left after season six because I doubt anyone was sick of his character. He was after all the guy who nailed the murderer of Jake the Dog back in season 2. Lewis, Munch, and Lt. Al Giardello also see the show through, which was more cast than NYPD or Law & Order had by their 7th seasons. It's great to see Munch still on Law & Order: SVU after playing him for 12 years.As for by all the DVDs together, you don't get anything extra, but it is cheaper than buying them separately. The special features decrease in quality as the season's progress, but they are still pretty good. My one problem is that the episodes from Law & Order that crossed over with Homicide were not included.

925124,AY7YN8E6NFY94,B000AAD8HM,"Richard C. Geschke ""In search of History!!""","[1, 2]","Homicide:  Life in the Street should be considered the most realistic perception of real police work depicted on the small or large screen.  It should be perceived as the classic forerunner of all Police depictions on TV or in the Movies.For 7 seasons and 122 episodes culminating with a made for TV movie, this series captivated TV audiences.  The main actors who contributed much to this excellent series were Daniel Baldwin, Richard Belzer, Clark Johnson, Yaphet Kotto, Kyle Secor and Andre Braugher.Most episodes were indeed set out in the streets of Baltimore where the crimes occurred.  All personal relationships between the detectives were interwoven into each case.  These personal problems and relationships carried on in the theme of the program.Homicide's signature standard was the scenes set in the interrogation room.  Detectives Pembleton and Bayliss excelled in solving crimes in this room given the name of ""The Box"".Also prevalent throughout the series was the rather paternal command of Lt. Al Giardello's handling of this eclectic group of detectives.This depiction of police work on the streets of Baltimore held its grip on TV audiences for 7 seasons.  I saw all the episodes as they were aired.  When I bought this complete DVD set, I saw things I did not see the first time.  With no commercial interruptions, I was able to better understand the full concept of what Paul Attanasio was trying to convey.This is a classic series.  You can't go wrong in purchasing the entire series.  Five Stars!
