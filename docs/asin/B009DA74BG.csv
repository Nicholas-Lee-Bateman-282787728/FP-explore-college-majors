As a retired E9 who was on the USS KITTY HAWK when the F14 crash shown in Season 5 actually occurred I  expected more thought would go into packaging these historical and tragic events.  In fact both the Pilot and Radar Intercept Officer survived the ramp strike. The Pilot had very few night traps.  Back to the packaging; cardboard slips are no way to keep DVD's secure from scratches.  The box itself is cumbersome and gaudy to say the least. There is nothing gaudy about the uniforms of the United States Navy or its uniforms.  I would hope all studios take note, no cardboard sleeves. Compact packaging for a compact package.
