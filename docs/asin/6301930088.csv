Note the hair slicked back. AudreyWood plays the bubble-headed moll who divides her favorsbetween Brosnan and Skerrit, showing little emotion for eitherguy. Nice seedy race track atmosphere, pretty hot love scenes,and a light hearted adio accompanied by the Spanish versionof ""My Way"".

272898,A1MM6PU8E3VZ5L,6301930088,"A. Nathaniel Wallace, Jr. ""Nosidino""","[0, 0]","The Heist (Not To Be Confused With Heist), is nothing more than an average ""heist"" movie. Is it better than The Score or the aforementioned Heist? No, it is not. Is it on par with Loophole, The Friends of Eddie Coyle, Straight Time or Blood & Wine? No, it is not. It is nowhere even close to The Bank Job or Parker, either.This is nothing but a lighthearted caper mpovie that's plot is totally unrealistic. Skinner is a man who was framed for a crime he did not commit. He plans to get even with the former business partner that set him up (Tom Skeritt). None of the characters in this movie are sympathetic and I really did not care for any of them. Not even the suave debonair Brosnan. This movie is not horrible, it's just not good.I give it Three Stars for trying to be a good movie. The day before I'd seen Layer Cake and (Ironically Another Similar Genre Film With An Actor That Would Go On To Play James Bond) it was so much better. Another thing I did not like about this movie was the female lead was not that attractive. To me this has got to be of import to a movie like this. The late great actors Noble Willingham and Robert Prosky were good, but other than that this movie fell far short of its goal.On top of which, the plot was difficult to understand. He returns the money he went through all the trouble to steal? Prosky's character, Dancer (A Stupid Name If Ever There Was One), wins a big haul at the races but we don't know for how much. I get the idea that he wins the money that Skinner returns to the race track. But this is never made clear. This was a major flaw in the plot.There were some nice shots of San Diego, however. This is the 20th review overall for this movie and the third Three-Star review.A.
