It is a great story about a proto-type weapon cyborg suit that is sent to earth by it's creators to escape destruction on it's own planet which is under attack.  A 12 year old boy, who is having problems of his own - lack of courage, etc. - finds the suit which he calls ""Cy"" and figures that his life can't possibly get any worse.  So he enters the suit as the biotic host and becomes one with Cy.  That's where the action begins.  He finds out that, since Cy is a prototype, they must engage and battle a hostile warrior, and what a battle they encounter!  The movie has a great story line and is full of comedy.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for an entertaining 90 minutes to break from reality and get away from it all.  Kids of any age will really enjoy it too.  I would categorize it as soft science fiction, but it is really more of a drama comedy.",5,Star Kid,1208304000,"04 16, 2008",2008,1004,"['great', 'movie', 'had', 'seen', 'few', 'times', 'cable', 'DISNEY', 'Channel', 'was', 'glad', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'copy', 'great', 'story', 'proto-type', 'weapon', 'cyborg', 'suit', 'sent', 'earth', 'creators', 'escape', 'destruction', 'own', 'planet', 'attack', '12', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'who', 'having', 'problems', 'own', 'lack', 'courage', 'etc', 'suit', 'Cy', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'get', 'worse', 'suit', 'biotic', 'host', 'one', 'Cy', 'where', 'action', 'out', 'Cy', 'prototype', 'must', 'engage', 'battle', 'hostile', 'warrior', 'what', 'battle', 'encounter', 'movie', 'great', 'story', 'line', 'full', 'comedy', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'looking', 'entertaining', '90', 'minutes', 'break', 'reality', 'get', 'away', 'Kids', 'age', 'will', 'really', 'enjoy', 'too', 'would', 'categorize', 'soft', 'science', 'fiction', 'really', 'more', 'drama', 'comedy']",N/A

The vast number of close-ups of Joseph's face (when he is inside the alien-built cyber-suit) is a STUDY in good acting-concentration.  I never knew that Joe's face was that expressive ( and while we are on this topic, did ANYONE catch Joe ""pulling a Bugs Bunny"" with his eye brows, in an early scene of Simon Birch?).  Anyway, my point is that Joseph has a RARE and magical face that is wonderfully expressive.  Star Kid is solid, and a fun flick to watch over popcorn or hot coco.

189501,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,1573623830,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[0, 0]","""Star Kid"" seems like it could be a bit of a passion project for writer-director Manny Coto, as it combines a bunch of genres he's worked on: science-fiction, action, and horror. It's also a pretty ambitious feature for a small studio like Trimark Pictures, but not necessarily more so than other films they've produced. Cumulatively, I think it's a unique idea for a movie that could have been pulled off a lot better with a bigger budget and with a broader target audience. I wish more movies like this were being made nowadays, but it's easy to guess why they aren't.The story: Spencer Griffith (Joseph Mazzello) is a troubled kid who comes upon the Cyborsuit (Alex Daniels, stunt double forGeorge Clooney) - a technologically-advanced suit of armor, jettisoned from a distant planet, requiring a host to operate it. Though thrilled with the abilities his new friend enables for him, Spencer doesn't yet realize that his symbiosis will require him to engage the Broodwarrior (Brian Simpson,On Deadly Ground) - a deadly alien soldier who's waged war on the Cyborsuit's home and has followed him to earth.At best, ""Star Kid"" is a mixture ofE.T.andPower Rangers: there's plenty of entertaining interaction between Spencer and the suit and a good deal of intergalactic cultural misunderstandings, but there are also a lot of stunt and action scenes present (more on those soon). Much like inJurassic Park, Joseph Mazzello can come off as very annoying at times with his high-pitched voice, but in the end he gives a pretty good, layered performance - more so than his older co-stars, even, with the possible exception of Corinne Bohrer (Vice Versa) as a benevolent science teacher. A minor supporting character played by Yumi Adachi inches towards some racial stereotypes, but it's not offensive enough to wreck the movie.I appreciate that the film relies primarily on prosthetics and puppetry to get its special effects across, especially because its CGI effects are very weak by today's standards. The creature designs are pretty entertaining, and unlike some other films I've seen (e.g.Arena), the costumes actually look good in action scenes. However, to my chagrin, there are plenty of action scenes in general but fair few actual fights between the suit and the alien warrior. For the most part, Spencer gets up to shenanigans that are amplified by the suit - sometimes to absurd levels (e.g. the refrigerator scene) - but for a creation designed for combat, he gets up to very little actual fighting.Amazingly, for a film that takes place in generally only one location and over the course of only a single day, this one doesn't feel as though it's missing scope, which is to the director's credit. Nevertheless, the movie's not great: it's as humorous as it ought to be, but lacks the adrenaline rushes that a picture with its premise ought to provide. I wouldn't mind seeing a more bombastic sequel to this one, but I think that's no more than a dream by now.",3,"""What do you call a cow with no legs?""",1382313600,"10 21, 2013",2013,2967,"['Star', 'Kid', 'could', 'be', 'bit', 'passion', 'project', 'writer-director', 'Manny', 'Coto', 'bunch', 'genres', 'worked', 'science-fiction', 'action', 'horror', 'also', 'pretty', 'ambitious', 'feature', 'small', 'studio', 'Trimark', 'Pictures', 'not', 'necessarily', 'more', 'so', 'other', 'films', ""'ve"", 'produced', 'Cumulatively', 'think', 'unique', 'idea', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'pulled', 'off', 'lot', 'better', 'bigger', 'budget', 'broader', 'target', 'audience', 'wish', 'more', 'movies', 'were', 'being', 'made', 'nowadays', 'easy', 'guess', 'why', ""aren't.The"", 'story', 'Spencer', 'Griffith', 'Joseph', 'Mazzello', 'troubled', 'kid', 'who', 'Cyborsuit', 'Alex', 'Daniels', 'stunt', 'double', 'forGeorge', 'Clooney', 'technologically-advanced', 'suit', 'armor', 'jettisoned', 'distant', 'planet', 'requiring', 'host', 'operate', 'thrilled', 'abilities', 'new', 'friend', 'enables', 'Spencer', ""n't"", 'yet', 'realize', 'symbiosis', 'will', 'require', 'engage', 'Broodwarrior', 'Brian', 'Simpson', 'Deadly', 'Ground', 'deadly', 'alien', 'soldier', 'who', 'waged', 'war', 'Cyborsuit', 'home', 'followed', 'earth.At', 'best', 'Star', 'Kid', 'mixture', 'ofE.T.andPower', 'Rangers', 'plenty', 'entertaining', 'interaction', 'Spencer', 'suit', 'good', 'deal', 'intergalactic', 'cultural', 'misunderstandings', 'are', 'also', 'lot', 'stunt', 'action', 'scenes', 'present', 'more', 'soon', 'Much', 'inJurassic', 'Park', 'Joseph', 'Mazzello', 'can', 'come', 'off', 'very', 'annoying', 'times', 'high-pitched', 'voice', 'end', 'pretty', 'good', 'layered', 'performance', 'more', 'so', 'older', 'co-stars', 'even', 'possible', 'exception', 'Corinne', 'Bohrer', 'Vice', 'Versa', 'benevolent', 'science', 'teacher', 'minor', 'supporting', 'character', 'played', 'Yumi', 'Adachi', 'inches', 'towards', 'racial', 'stereotypes', 'not', 'offensive', 'enough', 'wreck', 'movie.I', 'appreciate', 'film', 'relies', 'primarily', 'prosthetics', 'puppetry', 'get', 'special', 'effects', 'especially', 'CGI', 'effects', 'are', 'very', 'weak', 'today', 'standards', 'creature', 'designs', 'are', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'other', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'e.g.Arena', 'costumes', 'actually', 'look', 'good', 'action', 'scenes', 'However', 'chagrin', 'are', 'plenty', 'action', 'scenes', 'general', 'fair', 'few', 'actual', 'fights', 'suit', 'alien', 'warrior', 'most', 'part', 'Spencer', 'up', 'shenanigans', 'are', 'amplified', 'suit', 'sometimes', 'absurd', 'levels', 'e.g', 'refrigerator', 'scene', 'creation', 'designed', 'combat', 'up', 'very', 'little', 'actual', 'fighting.Amazingly', 'film', 'place', 'generally', 'only', 'one', 'location', 'course', 'only', 'single', 'day', 'one', ""n't"", 'feel', 'missing', 'scope', 'director', 'credit', 'Nevertheless', 'movie', 'not', 'great', 'as', 'humorous', 'ought', 'be', 'adrenaline', 'picture', 'premise', 'ought', 'provide', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'seeing', 'more', 'bombastic', 'sequel', 'one', 'think', 'more', 'dream', 'now']",N/A
