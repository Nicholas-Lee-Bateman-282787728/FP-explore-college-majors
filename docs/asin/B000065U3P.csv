Corollary question:  how can you tell when a lawyer is lying?  This is a story which is quite on point regarding legal ethics or lack thereof.  The concept is fine and deserving of broader discussion--ie, when a trial about a murdered man is made out to be (by the defense attorney) a trial of the decedent's homosexuality.  Although it should be obvious that a person's sexual preference does not have anything to do with the fact that a murder can be excused because of it.  The actors were good, tho not great.  This movie somehow did not generate the tension that a &#34;grade A&#34; picture should possess.  Therefore, &#34;Final Justice&#34;, although posing some interesting ethical problems, is a &#34;B movie&#34;---not bad, but yet missing the mark.",4,A Fine Idea,1398902400,"05 1, 2014",2014,846,"['Have', 'ever', 'wondered', 'why', 'attorneys', 'trial', 'deposition', 'are', 'never', 'put', 'oath', 'Corollary', 'question', 'how', 'can', 'tell', 'when', 'lawyer', 'lying', 'story', 'quite', 'point', 'regarding', 'legal', 'ethics', 'lack', 'thereof', 'concept', 'fine', 'deserving', 'broader', 'discussion', 'ie', 'when', 'trial', 'murdered', 'man', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'defense', 'attorney', 'trial', 'decedent', 'homosexuality', 'should', 'be', 'obvious', 'person', 'sexual', 'preference', 'not', 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'fact', 'murder', 'can', 'be', 'excused', 'actors', 'were', 'good', 'tho', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'somehow', 'did', 'not', 'generate', 'tension', '34', 'grade', 'A', '34', 'picture', 'should', 'possess', 'Therefore', '34', 'Final', 'Justice', '34', 'posing', 'interesting', 'ethical', 'problems', '34', 'B', 'movie', '34', 'bad', 'yet', 'missing', 'mark']",Final Justice

Not the least of which, is how skewed toward those with property and money it has become!.  Having the power to influence decisions has taken Justice out of all court proceedings and made a mockery of the Jurisprudence System.  Every State Dept. of Corrections level of law enforcement has made inappropriate and legally binding decisions through our errant precedent setting system fallible and just plain wrong.  People today without money or property are urged by court appointed attorneys normally Public Defenders to urge their clients to plead guilty and enter into a faulty and disgusting deceitful apparatus full of chicanery, artifice, and deception.  This film highlights the process by which this system is perped on an unsuspecting public who could care less what happens to the lower end of the economic spectrum.
