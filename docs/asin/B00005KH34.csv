After failing he is ashamed and promises to go to shaolin and learn kung fu to fight off the Manchurians.  Attempt after attempt he tries to enter the temple, each time he is caught and sent out until finally he is excepted due to his persistance and his good will.  Liu then encounters the legendary master killer himself (played by another) Sa Fe.  After trying to trick his way through the tests and training Sa Fe forces him to surround the temple with scaffling and forbids him to touch the floors of the temple.  For a year Liu sets scaffle and looks on as the other students train, picking up bits and pieces of the styles.  Finally after completion Sa Fe tells him to take it all down and then leave the temple.  In a rage Liu storms out of the temple feeling betrayed by the Master fo the 36 Chambers.  After returning home his old friends now jobless and moneyless surround him asking hime to fight for them. All he can tell them though is that he was never taught kung fu.  But after several acts of amazing strength and ability he begins to wonder if what Sa Fe made him do wasn't actually training itself.  With his new formed honor and attitude he returns to set the manchurians straight.  This film showcases some very original and impressive styles, The Roofing style used by liu, and then the Bench style used by the master villian of the film played by the spectacular Wang Lung Wei.

661980,A3NVAKN7UPEK2E,B00005KH34,"Eternal Rainbow ""CitizenX""","[2, 2]","I am a big fan of Shaw Brother movies, and I saw the first and third versions of the 36th Chambers movies. The first one stars Gordon Liu as San Te, who runs away and joins the Shaolin Temple. He is at first rejected but overcomes the obstacles before him through hard work, patience, determination, and diligence, winning  admirers within the temple until he earns his own chamber... The 36th Chamber.The third movie in the 36 Chamber series stars Gordon Liu in a supporting role next to Hsiao Hou who plays Fong Sai Yuk. In both of these actors' extremely capable hands, Disciples of the 36th Chambers doesn't disappoint. The martial arts is great. Disciples of the 36th Chamber is also the last movie Lau Kar Leung directed through Shaw Brothers.Comparatively, Return to the 36th Chamber is a TERRIBLE movie. In fact, it is probably the worst movie Lau Kar Leung ever made. For one, the movie doesnt' have a lot of fighting. Mostly actors like Gordon Liu (pretending to be monk San Te) getting beat up along side Hsiao Hou (dressed in disguise as a defenseless factory worker with bad teeth and skin). The worst part is that Hsiao Hou didn't get to display any of his acrobatic skills or kung fu in the movie and Gordon Liu didn't do any ""real"" fighting until the last five or ten minutes of the movie. Kara Hui was in it and she also did nothing. It was a big fat waste of time and I was so disappointed, I only needed to watch it once, unlike the other movies where I watch them over and over again.Gordon Liu plays a loser con man who can't get his lies straight, even after he is accepted into the Temple as a pupil of San Te (PLAYED BY ANOTHER ACTOR!!! luckily for him, the actor did a good job but still, he was NOT Gordon Liu in his most famous role). In this movie, Liu learns something called Scaffolding Kung Fu... that's right. Scaffolding. SIGH.If you like the 36th Chamber movies, watch the original or Disciples of the 36th Chamber (the latter is my favorite out of the series). Master Killer aka 36 Chambers is heralded as the best kung fu movie in history (though in my opinion, 8 Pole Diaphram, also starring Gordon Liu, is a much better movie).",1,Worst one in the 36 Chambers Series!,1311811200,"07 28, 2011",2011,2165,"['am', 'big', 'fan', 'Shaw', 'Brother', 'movies', 'saw', 'first', 'third', 'versions', '36th', 'Chambers', 'movies', 'first', 'one', 'Gordon', 'Liu', 'San', 'Te', 'who', 'away', 'Shaolin', 'Temple', 'first', 'rejected', 'obstacles', 'hard', 'work', 'patience', 'determination', 'diligence', 'winning', 'admirers', 'temple', 'own', 'chamber', '36th', 'Chamber.The', 'third', 'movie', '36', 'Chamber', 'series', 'stars', 'Gordon', 'Liu', 'supporting', 'role', 'Hsiao', 'Hou', 'who', 'Fong', 'Sai', 'Yuk', 'actors', 'extremely', 'capable', 'hands', 'Disciples', '36th', 'Chambers', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'martial', 'arts', 'great', 'Disciples', '36th', 'Chamber', 'also', 'last', 'movie', 'Lau', 'Kar', 'Leung', 'directed', 'Shaw', 'Brothers.Comparatively', 'Return', '36th', 'Chamber', 'TERRIBLE', 'movie', 'fact', 'probably', 'worst', 'movie', 'Lau', 'Kar', 'Leung', 'ever', 'made', 'one', 'movie', 'doesnt', 'have', 'lot', 'fighting', 'Mostly', 'actors', 'Gordon', 'Liu', 'pretending', 'be', 'monk', 'San', 'Te', 'getting', 'beat', 'up', 'side', 'Hsiao', 'Hou', 'dressed', 'disguise', 'defenseless', 'factory', 'worker', 'bad', 'teeth', 'skin', 'worst', 'part', 'Hsiao', 'Hou', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'display', 'acrobatic', 'skills', 'kung', 'fu', 'movie', 'Gordon', 'Liu', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'real', 'fighting', 'last', 'five', 'ten', 'minutes', 'movie', 'Kara', 'Hui', 'was', 'also', 'did', 'nothing', 'was', 'big', 'fat', 'waste', 'time', 'was', 'so', 'disappointed', 'only', 'needed', 'watch', 'once', 'other', 'movies', 'where', 'watch', 'again.Gordon', 'Liu', 'loser', 'con', 'man', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'lies', 'straight', 'even', 'accepted', 'Temple', 'pupil', 'San', 'Te', 'PLAYED', 'BY', 'ANOTHER', 'ACTOR', 'luckily', 'actor', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'still', 'was', 'NOT', 'Gordon', 'Liu', 'most', 'famous', 'role', 'movie', 'Liu', 'something', 'called', 'Scaffolding', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'right', 'Scaffolding', 'SIGH.If', '36th', 'Chamber', 'movies', 'watch', 'original', 'Disciples', '36th', 'Chamber', 'latter', 'favorite', 'series', 'Master', 'Killer', 'aka', '36', 'Chambers', 'heralded', 'best', 'kung', 'fu', 'movie', 'history', 'opinion', '8', 'Pole', 'Diaphram', 'also', 'starring', 'Gordon', 'Liu', 'much', 'better', 'movie']",Master Killer Collection: Return of Master Killer - Return to the 36th Chamber VHS
661981,A3OWRZ9AWWS8UL,B00005KH34,"""greg_rodgers""","[15, 16]","This movie is classic Liu Brothers! The story has nothing to do with  36 chambers of Shaolin aka Master Killer, however, Gordon Liu does visit the Shaolin Temple once again only this time he is a vagabond type that scams people for money. In an attempt to help his friends who work  company that makes material for clothing, he assumes the role of the  Shaolin Temples Monk San Te. In reality Liu's character knows no  Kung Fu and he uses tricks to make the companies slave drivers think thatHe is a master. When Liu confronts the owner of the company played by Wang Lung Wei, Wang quickly defeats Liu and then makes life 20 times  Worse for his friends. Liu, feeling like he has let his friends down vows to  Learn kung fu and defeat Wang in attempts to make things better for his Suffering brothers. Liu goes to Shaolin and tries to bluff his way into the  Temple but is caught by the Shaolin priests every time. Eventually the  Real San Te see's what Liu is trying and allows him to stay at the Temple, However, Liu is only allowed to fix the scaffolding around the 36 chambers And is not taught kung fu...so it seems. Liu, while fixing up the temple watches And learns kung fu by imitating the movements of the Shaolin Monks. After many years, San Te kicks Liu out of the temple knowing Liu has learned Kung fu, but Liu thinks he has not learned a thing until he returns to his friends. Exciting kung fu follows as Liu and Wang Lung Wei get it on!! Very good transfer of the fullscreen version of the Shaw Classic, however the movie Is plagued by overblown comedy, and comedic training sequences that actually Bog down this movie until the climatic fighting in the last 30 min, but that fighting Is so off the hook!!

661982,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B00005KH34,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","RETURN TO THE 36TH CHAMBER isn't quite in the legendary classic status that THE 36TH CHAMBER OF SHAOLIN falls into, but it's close and I find myself liking it just as much as the original film. Lau Kar-Leung (a.k.a. Chia-Liang Liu) directs again; Gordon Liu stars again. Except, in an inspired twist, Gordon Liu plays a fast-talking con artist who masquerades as the mighty Shaolin monk San Te, the character Liu played in THE 36TH CHAMBER OF SHAOLIN. The fights are absolutely fantastic, the Shaolin training is just as rigorous, and yet this 1980 sequel comes with a more lighthearted flavor. The balance works.""Where is your unbeatable skill, monk?"" is the taunt that would haunt Chou Jen-chieh. When dastardly Manchurians bully the poor laborers of the local fabric dye mill and lower their pay, Chou Jen-chieh (Liu) passes himself off as the monk San Te to intimidate the Manchurians into backing off. What follows is some laugh-out-loud moments as ""San Te,"" thanks to some timely assists from the factory workers, demonstrates his peerless kung fu prowess to the Manchurians. Except that the deception is penetrated, and the factory workers and Chou Jen-chieh, who in reality is quite inept with martial arts, are soundly, painfully trounced into submission. The Manchurian goons sneer at Chu Jen-chieh: ""Where is your unbeatable skill, monk?""What does a humiliated Chou Jen-chieh do? He hies himself to the Shaolin temple to learn real kung fu. Except it's not that easy. First, one must prove worthy to be a Shaolin monk. And, in this instance, a con man's glibness is not an asset. It's great fun watching Chou Jen-chieh try to sneak and trick and bluff his way into the monks' good graces. He's not fooling anyone.The real San Te, the abbot of the 36th Chamber, shows up in this movie, and it doesn't matter that an actor other than Gordon Liu is playing him. He's still a great character and he channels Mr. Miyagi in this picture. He takes pity on the con man, or maybe he sees something in him. But he allows Chou Jen-chieh to stay, tasking him with various menial challenges (washing his fake hair over a well, constructing bamboo scaffolding for the temple's upcoming renovation), with the promise of kung fu training implicit upon completion of these tasks. This is the middle act of the film, and it constitutes an exercise in fabulous slapstick as the undaunted Chou Jen-chieh, comically fumbling and bumbling, mimics shaolin moves during the monks' training sessions. When the scaffolding project is completed years later, the abbot expels a frustrated Chou Jen-chieh. Jen-chieh comes home, regarding himself as an abject failure.But, somehow, during his time of servitude in the 36th Chamber, Chou Jen-chieh had unwittingly developed his own unique style of kung-fu, something he later calls scaffolding kung fu, and he applies his new style in exacting revenge on the evil Manchurians. The film's last half hour provides some truly electrifying fight scenes. And Gordon Liu, unveiling unexpected comic timing and a sense of gleeful abandon, has never been more charming and infectious. RETURN TO THE 36TH CHAMBER is a really fun movie with flawless, innovative kung fu and great laughs. And, by great laughs, I'm not including that one guy with the exaggerated buck teeth a badger would die for.",5,getting taken out by scaffolding kung-fu is marginally better than getting thrashed by a folding wooden tea bench,1278288000,"07 5, 2010",2010,3316,"['RETURN', 'TO', 'THE', '36TH', 'CHAMBER', ""n't"", 'quite', 'legendary', 'classic', 'status', '36TH', 'CHAMBER', 'OF', 'SHAOLIN', 'close', 'find', 'liking', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'original', 'film', 'Lau', 'Kar-Leung', 'a.k.a', 'Chia-Liang', 'Liu', 'again', 'Gordon', 'Liu', 'again', 'inspired', 'twist', 'Gordon', 'Liu', 'fast-talking', 'con', 'artist', 'who', 'mighty', 'Shaolin', 'San', 'Te', 'character', 'Liu', 'played', 'THE', '36TH', 'CHAMBER', 'OF', 'SHAOLIN', 'fights', 'are', 'absolutely', 'fantastic', 'Shaolin', 'training', 'just', 'as', 'rigorous', 'yet', '1980', 'sequel', 'more', 'lighthearted', 'flavor', 'balance', 'Where', 'unbeatable', 'skill', 'monk', 'taunt', 'would', 'haunt', 'Chou', 'Jen-chieh', 'When', 'dastardly', 'Manchurians', 'bully', 'poor', 'laborers', 'local', 'fabric', 'dye', 'mill', 'lower', 'pay', 'Chou', 'Jen-chieh', 'Liu', 'off', 'monk', 'San', 'Te', 'intimidate', 'Manchurians', 'backing', 'off', 'What', 'laugh-out-loud', 'moments', 'San', 'Te', 'thanks', 'timely', 'assists', 'factory', 'workers', 'peerless', 'kung', 'fu', 'prowess', 'Manchurians', 'deception', 'penetrated', 'factory', 'workers', 'Chou', 'Jen-chieh', 'who', 'reality', 'quite', 'inept', 'martial', 'arts', 'are', 'soundly', 'painfully', 'trounced', 'submission', 'Manchurian', 'goons', 'sneer', 'Chu', 'Jen-chieh', 'Where', 'unbeatable', 'skill', 'monk', 'What', 'humiliated', 'Chou', 'Jen-chieh', 'do', 'Shaolin', 'temple', 'learn', 'real', 'kung', 'fu', 'not', 'easy', 'First', 'one', 'must', 'prove', 'worthy', 'be', 'Shaolin', 'monk', 'instance', 'con', 'man', 'glibness', 'not', 'asset', 'great', 'fun', 'watching', 'Chou', 'Jen-chieh', 'try', 'sneak', 'trick', 'bluff', 'way', 'monks', 'good', 'graces', 'not', 'fooling', 'anyone.The', 'real', 'San', 'Te', 'abbot', '36th', 'Chamber', 'up', 'movie', ""n't"", 'matter', 'actor', 'other', 'Gordon', 'Liu', 'playing', 'still', 'great', 'character', 'Mr.', 'Miyagi', 'picture', 'pity', 'con', 'man', 'maybe', 'something', 'Chou', 'Jen-chieh', 'stay', 'tasking', 'various', 'menial', 'challenges', 'washing', 'fake', 'hair', 'well', 'constructing', 'bamboo', 'scaffolding', 'temple', 'upcoming', 'renovation', 'promise', 'kung', 'fu', 'training', 'implicit', 'completion', 'tasks', 'middle', 'act', 'film', 'exercise', 'fabulous', 'slapstick', 'undaunted', 'Chou', 'Jen-chieh', 'comically', 'fumbling', 'bumbling', 'mimics', 'shaolin', 'moves', 'monks', 'training', 'sessions', 'When', 'scaffolding', 'project', 'completed', 'years', 'later', 'abbot', 'frustrated', 'Chou', 'Jen-chieh', 'Jen-chieh', 'home', 'regarding', 'abject', 'failure.But', 'somehow', 'time', 'servitude', '36th', 'Chamber', 'Chou', 'Jen-chieh', 'had', 'unwittingly', 'developed', 'own', 'unique', 'style', 'kung-fu', 'something', 'later', 'scaffolding', 'kung', 'fu', 'new', 'style', 'exacting', 'revenge', 'evil', 'Manchurians', 'film', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'truly', 'electrifying', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Gordon', 'Liu', 'unveiling', 'unexpected', 'comic', 'timing', 'sense', 'gleeful', 'abandon', 'never', 'been', 'more', 'charming', 'infectious', 'RETURN', 'THE', '36TH', 'CHAMBER', 'really', 'fun', 'movie', 'flawless', 'innovative', 'kung', 'fu', 'great', 'laughs', 'great', 'laughs', ""'m"", 'not', 'including', 'one', 'guy', 'exaggerated', 'buck', 'badger', 'would', 'die']",Master Killer Collection: Return of Master Killer - Return to the 36th Chamber VHS

And yes, it takes until midway through the movie, just like the original 36th Chamber when he shows up at Shaolin, but you get the same fantastic movie. Although Gordon acts alittle more comical in this loose sequel, he is still a trouble maker at Shaolin, just more comical in his training.But, the end, is, well..... Awesome. You get 15 minutes of fighting.Johnny Wang is great. He is the perfect opposite to Gordon. They each bring out the best in each other. Gordon can'not shine as well without Johnny and Johnny looks his best as a villan with Gordon.The copy by Dragon Dynasty is great.

This film genuinely made me laugh!  And that is not a frequent event for me while watching movies--even intentional comedies.  Liu vents a natural, unforced humor, that carries the story along and even cheerfully colors his fights; he's funny without, apparently, trying to be.This is one of my all-time favorite kung-fu films for hero portrayal and development.
