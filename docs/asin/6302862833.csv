341408,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,6302862833,Annie Van Auken,"[5, 5]","Thanks to the marvelousWILLIAM CASTLE FILM COLLECTION, after nearly 50 years I have finally gotten a chance to see a movie that fascinated me as a child.In ZOTZ! (1962), ancient language college professor Tom Poston translates the inscription on a 5,000-year-old coin, and learns how to use its magical powers.This silver dollar-sized disc gives the possessor three different powers:1.) Point at anyone or thing and it causes exquisite pain.2.) Look at any living thing, say ""Zotz!"" and it goes into slow motion.3.) Point and say ""Zotz!"" and the target instantly dies.Poston's rival for the retiring Dean's position is Jim Backus, a real weasel who kowtows to his superior and openly lobbies for the promotion while tearing Poston down. The Dean is played by Cecil Kellaway, and his wife is the perfectly cast Maggie Dumont.Louis Nye, Poston's associate on Steve Allen's Tonight show, cameos in the Pentagon scene. (Even if I remembered this moment from the first viewing, I never would've made the Allen connection as an 8-year-old.)The two meet as Poston is leaving General Fred Clark's office after he gets the brush-off as a kook. Poston offers the talisman as a way of disabling or destroying opposing armies ""as far as the eye can see"" and naturally the general thinks him quite mad and won't watch a demonstration of the power of Zotz!This is a potentially powerful weapon. While Gen. Clark putts golf balls during Poston's causing a small plane to temporarily nose dive from the sky, a foreign spy disguised as a window washer catches it all. He and his crew (including Mike Mazurki) pursue Poston back to California, and the professor is kidnapped from the Dean's farewell dinner party. With Poston's niece and girlfriend also held captive, it looks like he'll have to turn the talisman over to the forces of evil....",5,"""ZOTZ?

For years I had wanted to see it again, and finally had the opportunity when it came out on DVD. It was much as I had remembered it.There are parts that are hilarious, particularly when Professor Jones (Tom Poston) thinks he has his 5,000 year old magic coin with him (but doesn't) and releases a cage full of rats (or are they hamsters?) at a rather formal gathering, thinking he will kill them by pointing and uttering the word ""Zotz!"" Unfortunately, the coin is not in his possession at the moment and the rats run around the house, causing all sorts of consternation (and some laughs for the viewer). So, there's the slapstick element. And if one wants an hour or so of slapstick entertainment, Zotz! is a reasonably funny movie.However, the movie continues, and almost becomes a whole different movie. It leaves the college campus (where, as a former college teacher I can say that there have always been plenty of pretentious, self-absorbed faculty members and administrators who need to be taken down a notch or two, as they are in this movie) and moves to the Pentagon, where Professor Jones, realizing the great power of the coin, attempts to give it to the government. They do not recognize its value. But a window washer, who happens to be right outside the office where Prof. Jones is trying to convince the bureaucrats of the value of the coin (how convenient!), does recognize its worth. The window washer is also a Soviet agent. (What else would he be?) There ensues an attempt on the part of the Soviets to get the coin from Prof. Jones. And what was a nice, low-keyed film set on a college campus suddenly becomes an action flick, one, unfortunately, that is rather contrived.So, watch this movie, because the first part is actually funny. But unless you're into Soviet agents chasing American college professors up and down tall buildings, turn it off after an hour.",4,Lighthearted comedy,1379548800,"09 19, 2013",2013,1956,"['first', 'saw', 'Zotz', 'late-night', 'TV', 'sometime', 'mid', 'late', '1960s', 'years', 'had', 'wanted', 'see', 'again', 'finally', 'had', 'opportunity', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', 'was', 'much', 'had', 'remembered', 'it.There', 'are', 'parts', 'are', 'hilarious', 'particularly', 'when', 'Professor', 'Jones', 'Tom', 'Poston', '5,000', 'year', 'old', 'magic', 'coin', ""n't"", 'cage', 'full', 'rats', 'are', 'hamsters', 'rather', 'formal', 'gathering', 'thinking', 'will', 'kill', 'pointing', 'uttering', 'word', 'Zotz', 'Unfortunately', 'coin', 'not', 'possession', 'moment', 'rats', 'run', 'house', 'causing', 'sorts', 'consternation', 'laughs', 'viewer', 'So', 'slapstick', 'element', 'one', 'hour', 'so', 'slapstick', 'entertainment', 'Zotz', 'reasonably', 'funny', 'movie.However', 'movie', 'almost', 'whole', 'different', 'movie', 'college', 'campus', 'where', 'former', 'college', 'teacher', 'can', 'say', 'there', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'plenty', 'pretentious', 'self-absorbed', 'faculty', 'members', 'administrators', 'who', 'need', 'be', 'taken', 'down', 'notch', 'two', 'are', 'movie', 'Pentagon', 'where', 'Professor', 'Jones', 'realizing', 'great', 'power', 'coin', 'attempts', 'give', 'government', 'do', 'not', 'recognize', 'value', 'window', 'washer', 'who', 'be', 'right', 'office', 'where', 'Prof.', 'Jones', 'trying', 'convince', 'bureaucrats', 'value', 'coin', 'how', 'convenient', 'recognize', 'worth', 'window', 'washer', 'also', 'Soviet', 'agent', 'What', 'else', 'would', 'be', 'attempt', 'part', 'Soviets', 'get', 'coin', 'Prof.', 'Jones', 'was', 'nice', 'low-keyed', 'film', 'set', 'college', 'campus', 'suddenly', 'action', 'flick', 'one', 'unfortunately', 'rather', 'contrived.So', 'watch', 'movie', 'first', 'part', 'actually', 'funny', ""'re"", 'Soviet', 'agents', 'chasing', 'American', 'college', 'professors', 'up', 'down', 'tall', 'buildings', 'turn', 'off', 'hour']",N/A

But it is one of those bizarre films which sticks to the ribs of my mind. I remember it as a black and white comedy. Not a Ha Ha laugh out loud comedy, but as something that makes you think. The plot involves a college professor who decyphers the inscription on an amulet found in the temple of an ancient god. The god's name is Zotz. He is a much more intesting god than the phoney windbag in the Old Testament, who also has a hidden name (maybe if Jews say it, it makes them fart - I wouldn't know). If you hold the amulet - actually a coin about the size of a quarter - and say ""Zotz,"" whatever you are looking at goes into slow motion. If you point at something while holding the amulet, it experiences a sharp pain. And if you point and say ""Zotz"" at the same time, you kill the thing you are looking at. What a neat idea!I can't explain why this film has been lodged in my head all these decades. But every so often, I think about what I would do if I had that coin. Especially when I am driving. The memory of this film is a kind of guilty pleasure. In the movie, the amulet is finally lost, which is perhaps the only ending possible here. But the thought of going on a killing spree with a small coin in my pocket and total anonymity is so delightful that I pray to the Great God Zotz to manifest Himself in DVD.",3,reaching a bit,1186444800,"08 7, 2007",2007,1417,"['saw', 'movie', 'when', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'eight', 'years', 'old', 'must', 'confess', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'one', 'bizarre', 'films', 'sticks', 'ribs', 'mind', 'remember', 'black', 'white', 'comedy', 'Not', 'Ha', 'Ha', 'out', 'loud', 'comedy', 'something', 'think', 'plot', 'college', 'professor', 'who', 'inscription', 'amulet', 'found', 'temple', 'ancient', 'god', 'god', 'name', 'Zotz', 'much', 'more', 'intesting', 'god', 'phoney', 'windbag', 'Old', 'Testament', 'who', 'also', 'hidden', 'name', 'maybe', 'Jews', 'say', 'fart', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'hold', 'amulet', 'actually', 'coin', 'size', 'quarter', 'say', 'Zotz', 'are', 'looking', 'slow', 'motion', 'point', 'something', 'holding', 'amulet', 'sharp', 'pain', 'point', 'say', 'Zotz', 'same', 'time', 'kill', 'thing', 'are', 'looking', 'What', 'neat', 'idea', 'ca', ""n't"", 'explain', 'why', 'film', 'been', 'lodged', 'head', 'decades', 'so', 'often', 'think', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'had', 'coin', 'Especially', 'when', 'am', 'driving', 'memory', 'film', 'kind', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'movie', 'amulet', 'finally', 'lost', 'perhaps', 'only', 'ending', 'possible', 'here', 'thought', 'going', 'killing', 'spree', 'small', 'coin', 'pocket', 'total', 'anonymity', 'so', 'delightful', 'pray', 'Great', 'God', 'Zotz', 'manifest', 'Himself', 'DVD']",N/A
