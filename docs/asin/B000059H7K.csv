Kris Kristofferson plays a retired Tracker (Noble Adams) who is coaxed out of retirement by his friend Marshall Crawford (played by David Huddleston) to track Jack Stillwell and his 'gang' of 4 who broke out of Yuma prison and went on a killing spree.  The movie explores not only how bad some men in the west can be, but show's how they sometimes got that way.  Noble's son Tom (Mark Moses) has just returned home from his Eastern college.  Tom's Mother (Noble's first wife) died when Tom as a child, and now Noble has remarried and is living and ranching in an isolated area of New Mexico.  The Tracker does a great job building characters from conversations and actions as the movie progresses and that's really one of the things I liked most about this movie.  By the time the movie is over, you feel like you really know Noble, his son Tom, and Jack Stillwell because they reveal who and what they are by actions and conversation, not by flashbacks or narrations.  This may well be one of the best Kris Kristofferson movies he ever made.  The script is tight, the action and acting very well done and the story is more than good guys fighting bad guys.

572532,AK61LQI92GTCH,B000059H7K,"Steven Hellerstedt ""SH""","[43, 43]","Westerns seem uniquely well suited for the presentation of (near) epic morality tales.  Even when made for television they lend themselves to the Big Issues.  Beautifully filmed in New Mexico, THE TRACKER is a 1988 HBO production that touches on the stuff with deep roots - need and obligation, trust and home.  Mostly, though, it about vengeance and the fine line between the Good and the Bad.The Bad is ably portrayed by Scott Wilson, who's probably best remembered as Robert Blake's killing-spree partner in In Cold Blood.  Wilson plays fervent Danite and general sicko Jack `Red Jack' Stillwell. The legendary Danites, as the movie explains, were a perverted branch of Mormons who cleansed the Earth by indiscriminate murder. When Red Jack and gang invade New Mexico Federal Marshal Lane Crawford (David Huddleston) is called on to track them down, dead or alive.  But Crawford isn't as young as he used to be, and he needs help.  He calls on old friend and renowned tracker Noble Adams (Kris Kristofferson - `even the Apaches were afraid of Adams.')  Although inwardly reluctant, Adams agrees to track down the bad guys.  Even more reluctant is he to allow his half-son Tom (Mark Moses) to tag along, but the young man is set on it.  And so it is three hunting six - four bad guys and two female hostages.Although Kristofferson sometimes comes across a little detached he doesn't do anything here to embarrass Kevin Jarre's smart script or John Guillermin's taut direction.  Noble Adams is more complex than Kristofferson plays him.  He's a reluctant avenger, a brutal killer when the situation demands it, a man who sends his son off to college and learns that his return home may not be permanent.  It's the type of character western fans like to cheer for, one that's best developed by an actor who can play all the angles.  We cheer for Adams, alright, but we're a lot more interested when Wilson's Red Jack is on the screen.  All that doesn't make THE TRACKER any less a very good western, nor one that I wouldn't hesitate to heartily endorse.",4,Good morality tale,1130025600,"10 23, 2005",2005,2053,"['Westerns', 'seem', 'uniquely', 'well', 'suited', 'presentation', 'epic', 'morality', 'tales', 'Even', 'when', 'made', 'television', 'lend', 'Big', 'Issues', 'Beautifully', 'filmed', 'New', 'Mexico', 'THE', 'TRACKER', '1988', 'HBO', 'production', 'stuff', 'deep', 'roots', 'need', 'obligation', 'trust', 'home', 'Mostly', 'though', 'vengeance', 'fine', 'line', 'Good', 'Bad.The', 'Bad', 'ably', 'portrayed', 'Scott', 'Wilson', 'who', 'probably', 'best', 'remembered', 'Robert', 'Blake', 'killing-spree', 'partner', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'Wilson', 'fervent', 'Danite', 'general', 'sicko', 'Jack', 'Red', 'Jack', 'Stillwell', 'legendary', 'Danites', 'movie', 'were', 'perverted', 'branch', 'Mormons', 'who', 'cleansed', 'Earth', 'indiscriminate', 'murder', 'When', 'Red', 'Jack', 'gang', 'invade', 'New', 'Mexico', 'Federal', 'Marshal', 'Lane', 'Crawford', 'David', 'Huddleston', 'called', 'track', 'down', 'dead', 'alive', 'Crawford', ""n't"", 'as', 'young', 'used', 'be', 'help', 'old', 'friend', 'renowned', 'tracker', 'Noble', 'Adams', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson', 'even', 'Apaches', 'were', 'afraid', 'Adams', 'inwardly', 'reluctant', 'Adams', 'track', 'down', 'bad', 'guys', 'Even', 'more', 'reluctant', 'allow', 'half-son', 'Tom', 'Mark', 'Moses', 'tag', 'along', 'young', 'man', 'set', 'three', 'hunting', 'six', 'four', 'bad', 'guys', 'two', 'female', 'hostages.Although', 'Kristofferson', 'sometimes', 'little', 'detached', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'here', 'embarrass', 'Kevin', 'Jarre', 'smart', 'script', 'John', 'Guillermin', 'taut', 'direction', 'Noble', 'Adams', 'more', 'complex', 'Kristofferson', 'reluctant', 'avenger', 'brutal', 'killer', 'when', 'situation', 'man', 'who', 'son', 'college', 'return', 'home', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'permanent', 'type', 'character', 'western', 'fans', 'cheer', 'one', 'best', 'developed', 'actor', 'who', 'can', 'play', 'angles', 'cheer', 'Adams', 'alright', ""'re"", 'lot', 'more', 'interested', 'when', 'Wilson', 'Red', 'Jack', 'screen', ""n't"", 'make', 'TRACKER', 'less', 'very', 'good', 'western', 'one', 'would', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'heartily', 'endorse']",N/A
572533,A1E0RPGCXS4L2G,B000059H7K,TheHighlander,"[193, 196]","Noble Adams (Kris Kristofferson) is a retired tracker.  He runs a ranch and has a wife.  He wants nothing to do with his former life.  An old friend is calling in a favor and Noble must return to the hunt one last time.  Noble's son Tom (Mark Moses) has just graduated from college and has come to tell Noble that he will be living in the east and practicing law.  When he finds his dad is going on a track, he headstrongly joins the chase.  They will be tracking Red Jack Stilwell (Scott Wilson), a self professed Morman Avenging Angel that just broke out of prison and has been on a violent rampage.  He is travelling with a kidnapped women and child.Noble doesn't really want his son along.  He doesn't think the boy can handle the brutality of the land and is worried about the brutality that his son may see in him.  Noble Adams is not just any tracker, he's the best tracker ever.  The law's avenger, the army refers to him as Nemisis (The God of Vengeance).  Even the indians fear him.  So Noble, the aging sheriff and Tom Adams, the eastern college boy set out to hunt down the ruthless Red Jack Stillwell and his gang.Far from a typical father son bonding movie, Tom sees Noble as a cruel, harsh and exceptionally unforgiving man.  But he comes to understand that the land has made him that way.  Tom turns out to be just as hard but not quite as cold blooded as his father.  Hard men in a hard land, doing a hard job.This unhearalded HBO production stands up as one of the great westerns of all time.  More people need to see this movie.  It is a classic with no shortage of action or suspense.  Although filmed a number of years ago, HBO would do well to provide us with a sequel of equal caliber.Watch it and enjoy.",5,Hard Hitting,1030233600,"08 25, 2002",2002,1727,"['Noble', 'Adams', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson', 'retired', 'tracker', 'ranch', 'wife', 'nothing', 'do', 'former', 'life', 'old', 'friend', 'calling', 'favor', 'Noble', 'must', 'return', 'hunt', 'one', 'last', 'time', 'Noble', 'son', 'Tom', 'Mark', 'Moses', 'just', 'graduated', 'college', 'come', 'tell', 'Noble', 'will', 'be', 'living', 'east', 'practicing', 'law', 'When', 'dad', 'going', 'track', 'headstrongly', 'chase', 'will', 'be', 'tracking', 'Red', 'Jack', 'Stilwell', 'Scott', 'Wilson', 'self', 'professed', 'Morman', 'Avenging', 'Angel', 'just', 'broke', 'prison', 'been', 'violent', 'rampage', 'travelling', 'kidnapped', 'women', 'child.Noble', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'son', 'along', ""n't"", 'think', 'boy', 'can', 'handle', 'brutality', 'land', 'worried', 'brutality', 'son', 'may', 'see', 'Noble', 'Adams', 'not', 'just', 'tracker', 'best', 'tracker', 'ever', 'law', 'avenger', 'army', 'refers', 'Nemisis', 'God', 'Vengeance', 'Even', 'indians', 'fear', 'So', 'Noble', 'aging', 'sheriff', 'Tom', 'Adams', 'eastern', 'college', 'boy', 'set', 'out', 'hunt', 'down', 'ruthless', 'Red', 'Jack', 'Stillwell', 'gang.Far', 'typical', 'father', 'son', 'bonding', 'movie', 'Tom', 'Noble', 'cruel', 'harsh', 'exceptionally', 'unforgiving', 'man', 'understand', 'land', 'made', 'way', 'Tom', 'out', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'hard', 'not', 'quite', 'cold', 'blooded', 'father', 'Hard', 'men', 'hard', 'land', 'doing', 'hard', 'job.This', 'unhearalded', 'HBO', 'production', 'up', 'one', 'great', 'westerns', 'time', 'More', 'people', 'need', 'see', 'movie', 'classic', 'shortage', 'action', 'suspense', 'filmed', 'number', 'years', 'ago', 'HBO', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'provide', 'sequel', 'equal', 'caliber.Watch', 'enjoy']",N/A

Though made in 1988, HBO waited until 2001 to issue it on DVD.The simple and unfussy script by Kevin Jarre (""Tombstone"") is complemented by John Guillermin's simple and unfussy direction. * The dramatic center of the story is not so much Adams' and Crawford's search for a group of killers, as it is the internal conflict of Adams' son Tom, an Eastern-educated lawyer. Tom has been so thoroughly ""civilized"" that he can only shoot in immediate self-defense. He cannot kill in revenge. ** When he repeatedly fails to kill people he ""should"" kill, the story's tragic ending is inevitable.Highly recommended, an unknown film to share with friends.* It's a surprise his direction is as good as it is, as Guillermin has been associated with some big-budget stinkers.** There's heavy irony here, as the men being tracked are Danites who have no such compunction.
