Yes, indeed, there is a glowing review with each and every one of these dvd's, obviously written by a guy who works for that company(he doesn't even make a secret of that!)...but for once that is honest publicity because the prints are indeed clear and crisp and the sound is good to very good !Of course you will still get a better print with the Criterion edition, there are a few minor faults with this print, the framing of ""the most dangerus game"" is a bit off, but do not let that deter you from buying this dvd because everything else is as good as it will ever get for a dvd in this price range and in the public domain ! This is without any doubt the ""best value for money"" buy and with these prices(and hoping the other prints on their dvd's are as good as these) I will be buying more from this company..;and i will keep you informed, objectively and non-allied, as to the quality of their prints!",4,best of the budgets...,1187913600,"08 24, 2007",2007,1211,"['First', 'let', 'explain', 'review', 'people', 'who', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'will', 'know', 'have', 'great', 'DISaffection', 'low', 'budget', 'companies', 'who', 'put', 'out', 'lousy', 'copies', 'public', 'domain', 'films', 'HOWEVER..I', 'took', 'chance', 'Marengo', 'based', 'generally', 'favorable', 'reviews', 'was', 'NOT', 'dissapointed', 'Yes', 'indeed', 'glowing', 'review', 'one', 'dvd', 'obviously', 'written', 'guy', 'who', 'company', ""n't"", 'even', 'make', 'secret', 'once', 'honest', 'publicity', 'prints', 'are', 'indeed', 'clear', 'crisp', 'sound', 'good', 'very', 'good', 'course', 'will', 'still', 'get', 'better', 'print', 'Criterion', 'edition', 'are', 'few', 'minor', 'faults', 'print', 'framing', 'most', 'dangerus', 'game', 'bit', 'off', 'do', 'not', 'let', 'deter', 'buying', 'dvd', 'everything', 'else', 'as', 'good', 'will', 'ever', 'get', 'dvd', 'price', 'range', 'public', 'domain', 'doubt', 'best', 'value', 'money', 'buy', 'prices', 'hoping', 'other', 'prints', 'dvd', 'are', 'as', 'good', 'will', 'be', 'buying', 'more', 'company..', 'i', 'will', 'keep', 'informed', 'objectively', 'non-allied', 'quality', 'prints']",The Most Dangerous Game / And Then There Were None

But they changed the ending, which is infuriating as the ending of any ""Who-done-it?"" is really the entire climax of the story.  And of all the mysteries ever written, the elements of ""Who did it and How was it done"" were perhaps never more intense than in this book.  Christie fans will know what I am talking about.  I suggest you read the story first, if you haven't already, and then purchase this film.  This is my favorite Christie story.  Since apparently no one will make this book into a film that is true to the book, this is as good as it gets.Someone, PLEASE make a movie out of this book, and stick to the plot completely!!!

1021072,AVQJD41PLPOOQ,B000IJ7AGK,Eric F.,"[12, 12]","The original 1932 version of THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME is the best example of ""less is more"" that I can find.  It's two hours worth of drama, thrills and action packed into a mere 63 minutes!  The Marengo transfers for this and AND THEN THERE WERE NONE are excellent, and you can't beat the price!  The Criterion print of THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME is only very slightly better, but in my opinion, the Criterion price of at least $30.00 that you'd have to pay for a 63 minute movie is just not worth it.

Both films are classics, and deserve a treatment as good as this (if not better). I enjoy  ""And Then There Were None"" maybe a little more. The very stylish director, Rene Clair, assembled a cast of reliable ""supporting"" players, including Barry Fitzgerald, Walter Huston, Judith Anderson, Roland Young, etc., and they are in confident command of the wonderful Agatha Christie material. ""The Most Dangerous Game"" is also terrific; at only an hour long, it is suspenseful and the entire cast is marvelous (Joel McCrea, Fay Wray, Leslie Banks, Robert Anderson).
