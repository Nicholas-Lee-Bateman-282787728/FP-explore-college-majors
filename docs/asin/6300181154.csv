198285,ADGKZ4RFVAJ8H,6300181154,A Customer,"[16, 16]",Audie Murphy stars in the movie version of his autobiographydetailing his experiences in the Third Infantry Division in Italy and Southern France during the Second World War.  Audie won every American medal awarded for combat as well as a Purple Heart and several French medals for heroism.  The cast was excellent and complemented Murphy very well.  The combat scenes were extremely realistic and the only movie with rivals it for scenes of fighting in the Italian Campaign is &quot;The Story of GI Joe&quot; which was written by Ernie Pyle. Audie was a member of the &quot;greatest generation&quot; and will always be one of the great heroes of American history.  He made up for small stature with a heart and courage of enormous intensity.

198286,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6300181154,Acute Observer,"[1, 1]","To Hell and Back, 1955 filmThe movie begins with marching soldiers and band music. General Walter Bedell Smith talks about soldiers, some perform beyond the call of duty. This is the story of Audie L. Murphy. At age 12 he was a good shot. His father deserted the family. Audie, the oldest son, worked to support the family and quit school. Then the war began. There is bad news: their mother went peacefully. The younger children must go to a church orphanage. Now Audie will join the military. The Marines, the Navy, and the Paratroopers reject him; the Army doesn't. Audie was acting sergeant on the ship coming over, he inspects the troops. There is rough humor among the troops. Murphy wants combat, he has spirit. He sent his pay back to his family. When the Germans surrender in Tunisia the Third Division is then sent to Sicily. They walk along a road until a German machine gun opens fire. It is neutralized. Sicily was taken in 38 days. Murphy was promoted to corporal.Next they go to Italy. Corporal Murphy carries a Tommy gun. The bridges across the river were destroyed. Murphy's squad crosses the river at night for an attack. German 88s open up in the morning. The Army continues to advance. After two months they are sent back for a rest. Some soldiers start a fight in a bar. A joint operation? Murphy finds a home-cooked meal. They take part in Anzio, German 88s fire on the troops. They have to retake a tall farmhouse. The rain makes mud, this keeps German tanks away. They take the farmhouse. The artillery observer calls in the tank position so they are stopped and the road is blocked. The old soldiers don't make new friends. They must stop the repair of that damaged tank at night. Murphy is recommended for a decoration. They retreat from the tall farmhouse when enemy tanks advance. Armor and reinforcements allow them to advance. They reach Rome. Then they report for amphibious training. They will land is southern France next.Murphy's friend Brandon was careless. Murphy knocks out three enemy machine gun nests! They are held back by an observation post. Sergeant Murphy is promoted to Second Lieutenant. They advance until they come under fire. They are near Colmar. It must be taken ""at all costs"" to open the road to Germany. German tanks advance against them so they retreat. Murphy stays to call in the enemy's position, the shells drive the tanks back but their infantry advances. Murphy climbs on to a burning tank to uses its machine gun against the advancing Germans. But he is wounded in the hip. This will disqualify him from West Point. [Murphy's wound did not receive prompt attention, gangrene set in so more damage resulted. Modern medical treatment would have prevented this.] In August 1945 Lt. Audie L. Murphy received the Congressional Medal of Honor and many other medals. He was the most decorated American soldier of WW II.His book was more informative than this movie. After the war he acted in Hollywood movies, like some other veterans. This movie was the highest grossing movie until it was surpassed by ""Jaws"" in 1975. Movies are rated by the amount taken in, not the number of paid admissions. Given the rise of admission prices, this could be the most popular movie ever. There were other WW II movies made in the 1950s; their tone is different from the wartime movies of the 1940s. Note the commercial in the beginning, where a neighbor recommends joining the military and becoming a ""lifer"" because of the retirement benefits after twenty years.",5,Life in Combat,1320969600,"11 11, 2011",2011,3506,"['Hell', 'Back', '1955', 'filmThe', 'movie', 'marching', 'soldiers', 'band', 'music', 'General', 'Walter', 'Bedell', 'Smith', 'talks', 'soldiers', 'perform', 'call', 'duty', 'story', 'Audie', 'L.', 'Murphy', 'age', '12', 'was', 'good', 'shot', 'father', 'deserted', 'family', 'Audie', 'oldest', 'son', 'worked', 'support', 'family', 'quit', 'school', 'Then', 'war', 'began', 'bad', 'news', 'mother', 'went', 'peacefully', 'younger', 'children', 'must', 'go', 'church', 'orphanage', 'Now', 'Audie', 'will', 'join', 'military', 'Marines', 'Navy', 'Paratroopers', 'reject', 'Army', ""n't"", 'Audie', 'was', 'acting', 'sergeant', 'ship', 'coming', 'over', 'troops', 'rough', 'humor', 'troops', 'Murphy', 'combat', 'spirit', 'sent', 'pay', 'back', 'family', 'When', 'Germans', 'surrender', 'Tunisia', 'Third', 'Division', 'then', 'sent', 'Sicily', 'walk', 'road', 'German', 'machine', 'gun', 'fire', 'neutralized', 'Sicily', 'was', 'taken', '38', 'days', 'Murphy', 'was', 'promoted', 'corporal.Next', 'go', 'Italy', 'Corporal', 'Murphy', 'Tommy', 'gun', 'bridges', 'river', 'were', 'destroyed', 'Murphy', 'squad', 'river', 'night', 'attack', 'German', '88s', 'open', 'up', 'morning', 'Army', 'advance', 'two', 'months', 'are', 'sent', 'back', 'rest', 'soldiers', 'start', 'fight', 'bar', 'joint', 'operation', 'Murphy', 'home-cooked', 'meal', 'take', 'part', 'Anzio', 'German', '88s', 'fire', 'troops', 'have', 'retake', 'tall', 'farmhouse', 'rain', 'mud', 'keeps', 'German', 'tanks', 'away', 'take', 'farmhouse', 'artillery', 'observer', 'tank', 'position', 'are', 'stopped', 'road', 'blocked', 'old', 'soldiers', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'new', 'friends', 'must', 'stop', 'repair', 'damaged', 'tank', 'night', 'Murphy', 'recommended', 'decoration', 'retreat', 'tall', 'farmhouse', 'when', 'enemy', 'tanks', 'advance', 'Armor', 'reinforcements', 'allow', 'advance', 'reach', 'Rome', 'Then', 'report', 'amphibious', 'training', 'will', 'land', 'southern', 'France', 'next.Murphy', 'friend', 'Brandon', 'was', 'careless', 'Murphy', 'out', 'three', 'enemy', 'machine', 'gun', 'nests', 'are', 'held', 'back', 'observation', 'post', 'Sergeant', 'Murphy', 'promoted', 'Second', 'Lieutenant', 'advance', 'come', 'fire', 'are', 'near', 'Colmar', 'must', 'be', 'taken', 'costs', 'open', 'road', 'Germany', 'German', 'tanks', 'advance', 'retreat', 'Murphy', 'call', 'enemy', 'position', 'shells', 'drive', 'tanks', 'back', 'infantry', 'advances', 'Murphy', 'burning', 'tank', 'uses', 'machine', 'gun', 'advancing', 'Germans', 'wounded', 'hip', 'will', 'disqualify', 'West', 'Point', '[', 'Murphy', 'wound', 'did', 'not', 'receive', 'prompt', 'attention', 'gangrene', 'set', 'so', 'more', 'damage', 'resulted', 'Modern', 'medical', 'treatment', 'would', 'have', 'prevented', ']', 'August', '1945', 'Lt.', 'Audie', 'L.', 'Murphy', 'received', 'Congressional', 'Medal', 'Honor', 'many', 'other', 'medals', 'was', 'most', 'decorated', 'American', 'soldier', 'WW', 'II.His', 'book', 'was', 'more', 'informative', 'movie', 'war', 'acted', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'other', 'veterans', 'movie', 'was', 'highest', 'grossing', 'movie', 'was', 'surpassed', 'Jaws', '1975', 'Movies', 'are', 'rated', 'amount', 'taken', 'not', 'number', 'paid', 'admissions', 'Given', 'rise', 'admission', 'prices', 'could', 'be', 'most', 'popular', 'movie', 'ever', 'were', 'other', 'WW', 'II', 'movies', 'made', '1950s', 'tone', 'different', 'wartime', 'movies', '1940s', 'Note', 'commercial', 'beginning', 'where', 'neighbor', 'joining', 'military', 'becoming', 'lifer', 'retirement', 'benefits', 'twenty', 'years']",N/A

The movie was adopted  from his best-selling autobiography, which my Mom let me read after  blackening out all of the four letter slang (as she called it). Perhaps it  shows that he was my childhood hero, and I still have a personalized  autographed photo somewhere reading &quot;Thanks, Barry, for being my  fan&quot; that a friend's mom got for three or four of us ten year olds at  the time this movie was released in the mid 1950s. It was the first movie I  saw ten times. And I wasn't alone; Murphy was a national icon.The  movie truly is a classic; tightly directed, poignant, honest, accurate, and  showing gripping combat without being gory or maudlin. It sometimes decends  into travelogue movie-theater type newsreel moments, but these are  thankfully rare and forgiveable. On the other hand, this is an interesting  and absolutely true story of a common and uneducated boy from rural Texas  who wanted more than anything to be a soldier and serve his country, and  his subsequent deeds and patriotism above and beyond the call of duty  inspired a whole generation of us who wanted to imitate his call to  country. Unfortunately we walked into another time and the miasma of  Vietnam. But that's another story for another time. Escape back to a time  when the moral choices were clearer, and a real live hero was available to  act his way memorably through an accurate recounting of his extraordinary  if abbreviated military career. He may be gone too soon, the victim of a  plane crash in the early 1970s, but his lifetime admirers remain.

198297,A1AUBGENRIZODO,6300181154,Dave Deubler,"[3, 7]","This fairly standard WWII pic is saved from banality by the presence of Murphy himself, who brings a first-person immediacy to the story that such films are too often missing.  The ""big picture"" is provided by an army general who does voice-overs in present-time (that is, 1955, when the film was made) because, as we are reminded repeatedly, a foot soldier doesn't often know why he's doing what he does - just that he's got to do it.  Murphy's performance is spot-on, although the dialogue is often weak, the soundtrack cheesy, and the directing crude by today's standards.  In fact the biggest flaw of this film is really that it's rather dated; few films of the era gave a better, more intimate portrait of a fighting man - but many have been made in the decades since.There's no room for doubt that Murphy was a fine soldier and a great American, and this outing shows him to be at least a competent actor - but on balance this is not all that great a film.  Because it's based on a real person's experiences, rather than a fictional concept, there's no real story to tell here.  So once you know that Murphy joined the army and didn't get killed, you already know the whole plot.  Absent plot, not to mention character development, what we're left with is kind of a documentary, recounting the exploits of a true American hero, but with such limited historical context that it doesn't make much of an educational tool, either.  Maybe this work can best be understood as a recruiting film; we see men we've come to know shot dead (as the violin music swells) but we never see the kind of gore that causes even the deaths of enemies to haunt men's dreams for the rest of their lives.If you really like the WWII movies made during the 1950's, this one is certainly worth seeing, even though it may not be worth owning.

198308,A2QZJAAPG0Q0XR,6300181154,Gilthoniel,"[17, 23]","OK, Audie Murphy fans, don't bash this review.  Audie Murphy was a great man, and a true American hero.  However, this much has to be said, all of the five star reviews of this movie here reflect a continuing admiration for the man, and not for the movie itself.As a child, I had often heard about Audie Murphy, about his status as ""the most decorated soldier in America"", and his later career as a B-movie star in Hollywood westerns.  Whenever Audie Murphy was mentioned, ""To Hell and Back"", both the book and the movie, were usually also mentioned.And so for all these years, I knew that this movie existed, but had never seen it.  One day, I finally read the book, and then checked out the movie at the local library.  And then I read some of Audie Murphy's biographies.What to say about this movie except that it was almost certainly the high point in the life of Audie Murphy.  Murphy was the sixth of twelve children of desperately poor Texas sharecroppers.  The father would abandon the family and the mother would die when Audie was sixteen.  World War II intervened, and Murphy's natural wholesomeness and survivalist skills as a hunter-warrior would provide him a route to become a national hero and a life as a movie star.""To Hell and Back"" was Murphy's most successful movie.  It was made in 1955, at a time when Americans wanted only to forget the dreadfully inconclusive Korean War, preferring to relive the simpler glories of WWII.  As a war movie, it has all the typical characteristics of that era - an unquestioning respect for the military (and all authority in general), and an unspoken acceptance of the concept (totally foreign to us today) that soldiers' lives are by nature expendable in a war.  Like other war movies of the 1950's, we never see any blood, nor are there guts spraying everywhere, and definitely no mortally wounded soldiers screaming in fear and agony.  Enemy soldiers who are killed fall quickly, silently and bloodlessly to the ground, like dummies.  American soldiers who are killed also fall silently and bloodlessly to the ground, but get more screen time - we get to see their faces contort in agony as they die from their phantom wounds.  Realism having long ago been lost, the heavy equipment of war - the tanks and other weapons - are also not quite right.  The burning M10 tank destroyer that Audie Murphy jumped on becomes a more readily procurable Sherman tank.  German tanks are substituted by the then prevalent M41 Walker Bulldogs.No, this is not ""Saving Private Ryan"".  Nor ""Platoon"".  Nor ""Apocalypse Now"".  This is not even ""The Longest Day"".  War movies are never meant to be documentaries, and thus are always limited in their depiction of real war by the social constraints of the times, and the Hollywood need to put a spin on a story that will bring in the customers.What I find most sad about ""To Hell and Back"", having read Audie Murphy's biographies now, is that his real story was much better:  Murphy's bravery, fighting skills, and exploits were even more astounding than what was depicted in this most sanitized and unrealistic of war movies.  Achieving all of that in the context of the poverty that he grew up in was even more amazing.  Much of this was because the ever modest Audie Murphy refused to allow his life and his exploits to be glamorized.Yes, Audie Murphy's story needs to be remade.  But such a story would find no currency in today's Hollywood - imagine that, a movie about a young white man, pulling himself out of poverty by becoming a soldier for his country, fighting for over two years continuously, and excelling at the art of war.  And then returning home as a hero, and finding even more success in life as a movie star, thanks to the help of many fellow Americans (James Cagney among them).

Murphy's service in WWII which led him from North Africa to Italy, France and finally Germany. Audie Murphy was the most decorated soldier of WWII who was wounded on several occasions. This movie is, again, a fictionalized account of his service during WWII.The movie begins with the young Audie, as oldest child, stepping into the shoes of the &#34;man of the house&#34; when his father abandoned the family in Depression Texas. Many of the traits of Audie as a leader in combat were fostered during this period when he learned to assume responsibilities and get things done without having to be told. The movie is perhaps simplistic in its portrayal of Murphy's reasons for joining the Army.The movie itself uses highly fictionalized episodes of his heroic service in many battles in several countries as Audie rose in rank as a result of his own willingness to lead, his courage and his shooting ability - something shared with many rural Americans such as Alvin York, hero of WWI. The movie does a fairly good job of showing the kind of combat men like Audie found themselves in during the war in Europe.The movie itself is a product of it's time without the overly bloody special effects the &#34;Saving Private Ryan&#34; generation is used to. Instead, it often focuses on the bonds between men in deadly combat. There is a scene where Murphy loses his best friend and compares favorably with the real-life loss of Lattie Tipton, Murphy's real best friend. This is an idealized portrait of an American hero without the modern tendency to &#34;make them more human&#34; - a euphemism for dragging their memories through the mud.This is a fine film that, while not historically correct in every way, is representative of the best of American heroism by a man who paid for his bravery with what we'd today diagnose as PTSD.

Murphy was, indeed, a hero. A hero who saw and experienced indescribable horror while still in his late teens. His persona was forged by many months of combat, and his eyes - the eyes of a man who'd seen too much - reflected that in all his films.

Based on the star's autobiography, this is the story of how Murphy became America's most-decorated soldier during WW II. After dwelling on Murphy's hard-scrabble Texas upbringing, the story moves ahead to 1942, when, at 18, Audie joined the army. Within a year, he was a member of the 7th Army, serving in North Africa, Italy, France and ultimately Germany and Austria. One by one, the members of Murphy's Company B are killed in the war, until only three men from the original company are left.The bulk of the film is given over to Murphy's conspicuous acts of combat bravery, and is highlighted by excellent battle sequences.From a script by Gil Doud*  Special footnote: -- Audie Murphy originally declined the opportunity to portray himself in the movie, not wanting people to think that he was attempting to cash in on his role as a war hero. Murphy initially suggested his friend Tony Curtis to play him. They had worked together on three Westerns, Sierra, Kansas Raiders and The Cimarron Kid.BIOS:1.

And what makes this classic film so very special is that it is a true story.  The events portrayed in TO HELL AND BACK are real, as they actually happened, without any Hollywood embellishment.After the death of his mother and at the tender age of 16, Audie Murphy, received special permission to enter the Army infantry, after being turned down by the Marines, the Navy, and the paratrooper corp.  Young and small for his age, Audie's squad mates felt the need to watch out for him, but soon Audie was taking care of them.  His quiet commitment to doing what was right, to doing the best job possible at all times, along with his heroism led to a series of promotions, and finally a battlefield commission.  His final mission earned him the Medal of Honor and made him ""the most decorated soldier in America.""  Unfortunately, a leg wound from that final mission also ended his military career, and at the age of 19, after just 27 months of combat action, Audie Murphy was honorable discharged from military service.  After the war, Audie Murphy became a B-movie star, making over 30 Hollywood westerns and other films, including TO HELL AND BACK, his own biography.TO HELL AND BACK is straight forward telling of Audie Murphy's life.  Simple and honest, TO HELL AND BACK portrays his affection for his comrades, his innate goodness, and his love of family and country.

198323,AATS9Q7VJ4PFI,6300181154,Kevin R. Austra,"[27, 27]","TO HELL AND BACK is a true rags-to-warrior story.  The wide-screen release presents this film the way it was meant to be screened.  TO HELL AND BACK is the film version of warrior-turned-actor Audie Murphy's best selling autobiography.  Murphy, the most highly decorated combat soldier in World War Two, was originally turned down by the US Marines and Navy.  Underage, Murphy needed special permission to enlist in the Army.Murphy soon proved his mettle in combat.  He distinguished himself in combat time and time again through campaigns in Sicily, mainland Italy, and France.  It was not until the final months of the European Campaign that a severe wound took the fearless Murphy out of the line and into a field hospital.A discussion about the film deserves a few comments on the original best selling book.  His autobiography almost did not make it to book store shelves.  Murphy was presented with a generous advance for his autobiographical war exploits.  Unfortunately, he found it very difficult to capture his experiences on paper.  Some have since speculated that Murphy was suffering from post traumatic stress syndrome.  Who could blame him?  After recovering from his war wounds, Murphy was decorated with the Congressional Medal of Honor.  As a hero he toured the United States as part of a war bond drive.  He turned down an opportunity to attend West Point and left active duty.  Screen legend James Cagney took an interest in Audie Murphy and sponsored Murphy's theatrical training.Murphy soon found himself in, what were then known as, B-movies.  Most of the movies were westerns.  Still, he achieved fame that was very far removed from his impoverished days in Texas.The book, TO HELL AND BACK, was still little more than a few poorly written pages when Murphy's publisher became impatient.  With a friend's help -- and reportedly the friend ghost authored the book for Murphy -- TO HELL AND BACK was completed, published, and became a best seller.The transition to film was a bit more difficult.  Universal studios bought the rights to the film and opted to use one of its stars, Audie Murphy, to play himself in the title role.  The Department of the Army solidly backed this production.  Fort Lewis, Washington was basically put at Universal's disposal.  Any worries that Murphy might have difficulties reenacting -- and reliving -- the heroic moments of his life were dispelled on the first days of location shooting.  Murphy handled the film as both a fine actor and veteran.The film itself is a bit dated.  The movie's introduction and occasional narration sometimes make it seem as though it is an Army training film.  What separates this undertaking from US Army Pictorial Center films is that it is in color, wide screen, and is one of the first World War Two movies to involve large scale infantry and tank attacks.  Some of the combat scenes in TO HELL AND BACK would not be matched until the war films of the mid 1960's such as TOBRUK, THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE, and so on.  TO HELL AND BACK is strong enough to stand on its own without an introduction, animated maps, and narration.You might even see this film as sort of a western.  Indeed, the movie soundtrack sounds as if it was meant for a cowboy film. The soldiers are generally clean cut.  With the exception of a few muddy scenes, the uniforms always appear too clean and starched to have been worn by real soldiers in continuous combat.  The grit that you will find in movies like BATTLEGROUND and ATTACK is absent from this film.  The screenplay is only disappointing in the non-tactical scenes.  Murphy's token romance with a beautiful Italian girl has no place in this movie.  The bar room brawl is also a bit cheesy.The soldier in Murphy shows through in this movie.  He salutes sharply, handles weapons like a veteran, and barks out commands as a real soldier.  In fact, in the beginning of the movie it is difficult to believe that Murphy is a green recruit.  His handsome youthful looks served him well in TO HELL AND BACK.  Though the film followed almost ten years after Murphy charged his last machinegun nest, he is believeable as a young soldier.The wide screen version of this film was long overdue.  The battle scenes are great. The label on the disk itself has a sort of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN design to it.  Unfortunately, the only special feature on the DVD is the movie trailer.My recommendation:  buy the DVD, the book, and Charles Whiting's biography of Audie Murphy, HERO.",3,A True American Hero,1111708800,"03 25, 2005",2005,4481,"['TO', 'HELL', 'AND', 'BACK', 'true', 'rags-to-warrior', 'story', 'wide-screen', 'release', 'film', 'way', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'screened', 'TO', 'HELL', 'AND', 'BACK', 'film', 'version', 'warrior-turned-actor', 'Audie', 'Murphy', 'best', 'selling', 'autobiography', 'Murphy', 'most', 'highly', 'decorated', 'combat', 'soldier', 'World', 'War', 'Two', 'was', 'originally', 'turned', 'down', 'US', 'Marines', 'Navy', 'Underage', 'Murphy', 'needed', 'special', 'permission', 'enlist', 'Army.Murphy', 'soon', 'proved', 'mettle', 'combat', 'distinguished', 'combat', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'campaigns', 'Sicily', 'mainland', 'Italy', 'France', 'was', 'not', 'final', 'months', 'European', 'Campaign', 'severe', 'wound', 'took', 'fearless', 'Murphy', 'line', 'field', 'hospital.A', 'discussion', 'film', 'few', 'comments', 'original', 'best', 'selling', 'book', 'autobiography', 'almost', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'book', 'store', 'shelves', 'Murphy', 'was', 'presented', 'generous', 'advance', 'autobiographical', 'war', 'exploits', 'Unfortunately', 'found', 'very', 'difficult', 'capture', 'experiences', 'paper', 'have', 'speculated', 'Murphy', 'was', 'suffering', 'post', 'traumatic', 'stress', 'syndrome', 'Who', 'could', 'blame', 'recovering', 'war', 'wounds', 'Murphy', 'was', 'decorated', 'Congressional', 'Medal', 'Honor', 'hero', 'toured', 'United', 'States', 'part', 'war', 'bond', 'drive', 'turned', 'down', 'opportunity', 'attend', 'West', 'Point', 'left', 'active', 'duty', 'Screen', 'legend', 'James', 'Cagney', 'took', 'interest', 'Audie', 'Murphy', 'sponsored', 'Murphy', 'theatrical', 'training.Murphy', 'soon', 'found', 'what', 'were', 'then', 'known', 'B-movies', 'Most', 'movies', 'were', 'westerns', 'Still', 'achieved', 'fame', 'was', 'very', 'far', 'removed', 'impoverished', 'days', 'Texas.The', 'book', 'TO', 'HELL', 'AND', 'BACK', 'was', 'still', 'little', 'more', 'few', 'poorly', 'written', 'pages', 'when', 'Murphy', 'publisher', 'became', 'impatient', 'friend', 'help', 'reportedly', 'friend', 'ghost', 'authored', 'book', 'Murphy', 'TO', 'HELL', 'AND', 'BACK', 'was', 'completed', 'published', 'became', 'best', 'seller.The', 'transition', 'film', 'was', 'bit', 'more', 'difficult', 'Universal', 'studios', 'bought', 'rights', 'film', 'opted', 'use', 'one', 'stars', 'Audie', 'Murphy', 'play', 'title', 'role', 'Department', 'Army', 'solidly', 'backed', 'production', 'Fort', 'Lewis', 'Washington', 'was', 'basically', 'put', 'Universal', 'disposal', 'worries', 'Murphy', 'might', 'have', 'difficulties', 'reenacting', 'reliving', 'heroic', 'moments', 'life', 'were', 'dispelled', 'first', 'days', 'location', 'shooting', 'Murphy', 'handled', 'film', 'fine', 'actor', 'veteran.The', 'film', 'bit', 'dated', 'movie', 'introduction', 'occasional', 'narration', 'sometimes', 'make', 'seem', 'Army', 'training', 'film', 'What', 'undertaking', 'US', 'Army', 'Pictorial', 'Center', 'films', 'color', 'wide', 'screen', 'one', 'first', 'World', 'War', 'Two', 'movies', 'involve', 'large', 'scale', 'infantry', 'tank', 'attacks', 'combat', 'scenes', 'TO', 'HELL', 'AND', 'BACK', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'matched', 'war', 'films', 'mid', '1960', 'such', 'TOBRUK', 'THE', 'BATTLE', 'THE', 'BULGE', 'so', 'TO', 'HELL', 'AND', 'BACK', 'strong', 'enough', 'stand', 'own', 'introduction', 'animated', 'maps', 'narration.You', 'might', 'even', 'see', 'film', 'sort', 'western', 'Indeed', 'movie', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'meant', 'cowboy', 'film', 'soldiers', 'are', 'generally', 'clean', 'cut', 'exception', 'few', 'muddy', 'scenes', 'uniforms', 'always', 'appear', 'too', 'clean', 'starched', 'have', 'been', 'worn', 'real', 'soldiers', 'continuous', 'combat', 'grit', 'will', 'find', 'movies', 'BATTLEGROUND', 'ATTACK', 'absent', 'film', 'screenplay', 'only', 'disappointing', 'non-tactical', 'scenes', 'Murphy', 'token', 'romance', 'beautiful', 'Italian', 'girl', 'place', 'movie', 'bar', 'room', 'brawl', 'also', 'bit', 'cheesy.The', 'soldier', 'Murphy', 'shows', 'movie', 'sharply', 'weapons', 'veteran', 'out', 'commands', 'real', 'soldier', 'fact', 'beginning', 'movie', 'difficult', 'believe', 'Murphy', 'green', 'recruit', 'handsome', 'youthful', 'looks', 'served', 'well', 'TO', 'HELL', 'AND', 'BACK', 'film', 'followed', 'almost', 'ten', 'years', 'Murphy', 'charged', 'last', 'machinegun', 'nest', 'believeable', 'young', 'soldier.The', 'wide', 'screen', 'version', 'film', 'was', 'long', 'overdue', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'great', 'label', 'disk', 'sort', 'SAVING', 'PRIVATE', 'RYAN', 'design', 'Unfortunately', 'only', 'special', 'feature', 'DVD', 'movie', 'trailer.My', 'recommendation', 'buy', 'DVD', 'book', 'Charles', 'Whiting', 'biography', 'Audie', 'Murphy', 'HERO']",N/A

The most decorated American soldier who ever lived -- the 2nd most visited grave at Arlington National Cemetary after JFK -- his war experiences would leave with him with nightmares for the rest of his life.  One of his wives once said that Murphy always slept with a .45 automatic under his pillow and would have nightmares where he called out the names of dead buddies.  SGT York is revered for basically one battle.  Audie Murphy was involved in every campaign from North Africa to Germany.  While the movie depicts real events, some are somewhat toned down.  While he did shoot down the German who killed his buddy in real life Murphy fired so many rounds into the guy that he literally blew him to pieces.  His final action, jumping on a burning tank and holding off a German advance does not quite show the incredible courage of this soldier.  He held off that attack for nearly an hour.  This is why he was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor.

The Army provides a Depression-era kid from East Texas with a strong family structure that he has never really experienced...In 1937, a young Audie Murphy (played by Gordon Gebert as a boy, by Murphy himself later) is forced to become the head of a family with an ailing mother and an absent father... He drops out of grade school and goes to work full time to provide for his younger siblings until, at roughly the same time, World War II starts and his mother dies...By enlisting in, Murphy can provide more money for his brothers, but neither the Navy nor the Marines were interested in the small guy...In the Army, Murphy is promoted to Corporal on the troop ship carrying him overseas where he joins the 3rd Infantry Division, B Company, 15th Regiment... It soon becomes apparent that the likable 'baby face kid,' hardly old enough to shave, has a genuine aptitude for soldiering...After North Africa, his outfit takes part in the invasions of Sicily, Anzio and Southern France... In every engagement, Murphy steps up and excels as a soldier... At the same time, he becomes friends with Brandon (Charles Drake), Johnson (Marshall Thompson), and Kerrigan (Jack Kelly). He sees himself as part of a unit, and everything that he does is meant to advance the unit, not the individual... Murphy liked to work alone, putting only himself at risk...The one long scene that moves away from the Military--an interlude in an Italian town where he meets Maria (Susan Kohner) and her family, is embarrassingly bad... As long as the focus stays on the platoon's activities on the battlefield, the film is in fine shape... Director Jesse Hibbs makes the cold mud and rain of the Italian campaign believably real, especially a series of scenes revolving around a farmhouse and a burning tank...One might assume that Murphy's indomitable courage would be described as Rambo--like heroics, but in comparing the film with the official combat reports, it is clear that Murphy became an astounding soldier by skill, training, intelligence, and luck... He was an equal opportunity soldier, doing everything the front line combatant is required to do in order to take and hold ground through Sicily, Italy, France, and into Germany...All of the events recounted in the film take place before Murphy was 19 years old... In that brief military career, Audie L. Murphy becomes one of the best fighting combat soldiers of the last century... He never really seemed to care about the medals or glory, just the men of his unit and friends who fall down in the European Theater of Operations...Murphy died tragically on May 28, 1971, when the private plane in which he was a passenger crashed into a mountain near Roanoke, Virginia...

198353,AK61LQI92GTCH,6300181154,"Steven Hellerstedt ""SH""","[6, 7]","TO HELL AND BACK is a rarity of rarities.  It tells the story of `the most decorated soldier in the history of the United States,' as Gen. Walter Bedell Smith reminds us from behind a polished desk in the film's prologue.  The true story, of course, is Audie Murphy's, the B-movie star who also happened to be one of America's greatest war heroes.The CinemaScope/Technicolor movie begins with 12-year-old Audie leaving school to become `the man of the family,' substituting for a missing father who, presumably, is out looking for a job.  In any event, war breaks out and the under-aged Murphy is turned down by both the Marines and the Navy, finally finding billet with the Army.There's something a little strained and mawkish about the pre-Army scenes, as there will be a bit later when the troops are at ease and on leave.  Murphy doesn't come off as a saint by any means, but the story is pretty sanitized and standard issue.  Still, there are some relaxed bits that cut pretty sharp.  A meal Murphy shares with an Italian family is interrupted by air raid sirens.  The family goes to shelter, Murphy waits upstairs for the all-clear to sound.  The young woman of the family comes up to speak to him and asks him ""Are you afraid?""  ""All the time,"" he replies as soon as the words are out of her mouth.  It's a nice touch in a nice scene, weighted immeasurably by knowing that it's the real hero uttering them.TO HELL AND BACK really shines during its combat scenes, which are uniformly well choreographed and exciting.  When Murphy and the troops fight for a farmhouse in Anzio, or later when the troops are pinned down by a string of German machine gun nests and Murphy earns one of his many medals clearing them out, the scenes are plotted out in a totally comprehensible form.War movie fans who might shy away after suffering through a few of Murphy's lesser efforts should give TO HELL AND BACK a chance.

198356,APRZ2IVM8JTLV,6300181154,The Mysterious Traveler,"[2, 3]","TO HELL AND BACK (1955) Directed by Jesse Hibbs. Based on the book by Audie Murphy. Technical advice by Audie Murphy. Score by Henry Mancini, William Lava and Irving Gertz. Make up by Bud Westmore. A Universal-International Picture!Starring Audie Murphy (as Audie Murphy), David Janssen, Charles Drake, Marshall Thompson, Paul Picerni. Jack Kelly, Denver Pyle, Brett Halsey, Henry Kulky, John McIntire, and General Walter Bedell Smith in the role of General Walter Bedell Smith.The biography of America's most decorated soldier from 1937 when he was a poverty stricken twelve year old struggling to support his family to his entry into the Army......after being rejected by the Marines and the Navy......during the Second World War.  As per Murphy's own military career and as in his book--(which is highly recommended reading incidentally), the film gives a fine overview of the campaigns in Sicily, the Italian boot and the invasion of Southern France. The battle scenes are extremely well done and accurate. There are several  sequences involving tank actions and an extended battle involving an abandoned house near Anzio that are first rate and extremely exciting.This film was made before SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and CGI ruined the modern historical film.  Here the viewer will be surprised by coherent easy to comprehend battle sequences where one can see what is going on, it is not always blue gray. the sun shines occaisionaly, characters smoke and are not immediately killed or identified as evil for doing so, a character can be an Indian, be called ""Chief"" by his buddies and we do not get a speech about the plight of the Red Man, characters actually speak to one another and say things rather than just spit out endless mindless obscenities and blood and guts are not squishing over the camera lens. It WILL take the modern viewer some time to get used to all of this but once he does...if he can....he will discover a truly enlightening, ennobling and entertaining film about the American soldier who fought in Europe during WW2 and a true story played by the man who was there and did what is shown. What is more. the film can safely be shown to young people curious about American history without parents living in fear about yet another Hollywood ambush.Obviously Murphy is very good playing himself and this is probably the most accurate dramatization of what an American war hero did........it would have to be!  However where the film really shines and thus adds import to the heroics is the fine cast of 50s support players who make up Murphy's squad......all based on real men......many of whom did not make it back.  It is a sad comment on many film fans today who would recognize almost the entire cast as having starred in, at least, one Fifties Sci Fic/Horror film---the picture is a dream cast that way......yet these small minds would never dream of watching this film because it is patriotic, supports the troops and about war and war....unless it involves phasers is...like....icky.  Yet it is these solid actors(Marshall and Drake really stand out though all are good) of the type we do not have anymore who admirably succeed in bringing such men of the Greatest Generation to memorable life and the film takes great pains to say..that yes...perhaps they did not win as many medals as Murphy but they did their bit and it was through their sacrifice and courage that Murphy was able to do what he did and that the United States was able to win the war.This picture is a tribute to the average American soldier and a perfect film to watch on Memorial Day.",4,Once upon a time Hollywood supported the Troops and America heralded her heroes....,1275350400,"06 1, 2010",2010,3583,"['TO', 'HELL', 'AND', 'BACK', '1955', 'Directed', 'Jesse', 'Hibbs', 'Based', 'book', 'Audie', 'Murphy', 'Technical', 'advice', 'Audie', 'Murphy', 'Score', 'Henry', 'Mancini', 'William', 'Lava', 'Irving', 'Gertz', 'Make', 'up', 'Bud', 'Westmore', 'Universal-International', 'Picture', 'Starring', 'Audie', 'Murphy', 'Audie', 'Murphy', 'David', 'Janssen', 'Charles', 'Drake', 'Marshall', 'Thompson', 'Paul', 'Picerni', 'Jack', 'Kelly', 'Denver', 'Pyle', 'Brett', 'Halsey', 'Henry', 'Kulky', 'John', 'McIntire', 'General', 'Walter', 'Bedell', 'Smith', 'role', 'General', 'Walter', 'Bedell', 'Smith.The', 'biography', 'America', 'most', 'decorated', 'soldier', '1937', 'when', 'was', 'poverty', 'stricken', 'twelve', 'year', 'old', 'struggling', 'support', 'family', 'entry', 'Army', 'being', 'rejected', 'Marines', 'Navy', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'Murphy', 'own', 'military', 'career', 'book', 'highly', 'recommended', 'reading', 'incidentally', 'film', 'fine', 'overview', 'campaigns', 'Sicily', 'Italian', 'boot', 'invasion', 'Southern', 'France', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'accurate', 'are', 'several', 'sequences', 'involving', 'tank', 'actions', 'extended', 'battle', 'involving', 'abandoned', 'house', 'Anzio', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'extremely', 'exciting.This', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'SAVING', 'PRIVATE', 'RYAN', 'CGI', 'ruined', 'modern', 'historical', 'film', 'Here', 'viewer', 'will', 'be', 'surprised', 'coherent', 'easy', 'comprehend', 'battle', 'sequences', 'where', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'going', 'not', 'always', 'blue', 'gray', 'sun', 'shines', 'occaisionaly', 'characters', 'smoke', 'are', 'not', 'immediately', 'killed', 'identified', 'evil', 'doing', 'so', 'character', 'can', 'be', 'Indian', 'be', 'called', 'Chief', 'buddies', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'speech', 'plight', 'Red', 'Man', 'characters', 'actually', 'speak', 'one', 'say', 'things', 'rather', 'just', 'spit', 'out', 'endless', 'mindless', 'obscenities', 'blood', 'guts', 'are', 'not', 'squishing', 'camera', 'WILL', 'take', 'modern', 'viewer', 'time', 'get', 'used', 'once', 'can', '.he', 'will', 'discover', 'truly', 'enlightening', 'ennobling', 'entertaining', 'film', 'American', 'soldier', 'who', 'fought', 'Europe', 'WW2', 'true', 'story', 'played', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'there', 'did', 'what', 'shown', 'What', 'more', 'film', 'can', 'safely', 'be', 'shown', 'young', 'people', 'curious', 'American', 'history', 'parents', 'living', 'fear', 'yet', 'Hollywood', 'ambush.Obviously', 'Murphy', 'very', 'good', 'playing', 'probably', 'most', 'accurate', 'dramatization', 'what', 'American', 'war', 'hero', 'did', '..it', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'However', 'where', 'film', 'really', 'shines', 'thus', 'import', 'heroics', 'fine', 'cast', '50s', 'support', 'players', 'who', 'make', 'up', 'Murphy', 'squad', 'based', 'real', 'men', 'many', 'whom', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'back', 'sad', 'comment', 'many', 'film', 'fans', 'today', 'who', 'would', 'recognize', 'almost', 'entire', 'cast', 'having', 'starred', 'least', 'one', 'Fifties', 'Sci', 'Fic/Horror', 'film', '-the', 'picture', 'dream', 'cast', 'way', 'yet', 'small', 'minds', 'would', 'never', 'dream', 'watching', 'film', 'patriotic', 'troops', 'war', 'war', '.unless', 'phasers', '.icky', 'solid', 'actors', 'Marshall', 'Drake', 'really', 'stand', 'out', 'are', 'good', 'type', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'anymore', 'who', 'admirably', 'succeed', 'bringing', 'such', 'men', 'Greatest', 'Generation', 'memorable', 'life', 'film', 'great', 'pains', 'say..that', 'yes', 'perhaps', 'did', 'not', 'win', 'many', 'medals', 'Murphy', 'did', 'bit', 'was', 'sacrifice', 'courage', 'Murphy', 'was', 'able', 'do', 'what', 'did', 'United', 'States', 'was', 'able', 'win', 'war.This', 'picture', 'tribute', 'average', 'American', 'soldier', 'perfect', 'film', 'watch', 'Memorial', 'Day']",N/A
