After loving Dirty Girl I ran out and bought this DVD. While I enjoyed it, I did not feel it was was sophisticated or cutting edge as her previous outings. This concert seems to rely too heavily on name-calling and some really unfunny knock-knock type jokes. She seems to have less interaction with the audience this time around (one of the strengths of her lives shows) and just uses them to call names without much real depth. She has a few moments of brilliance and the rest is ok. Also, both Lisa and her fans are not easily offended, but I felt like she used a certain derogatory racial slur too much in this production, especially since it was not connected to a ""bit"" but was just used to cuss someone out. This DVD is still great fun, but not a must own.",3,Not As Good As Dirty Girl!,1238630400,"04 2, 2009",2009,874,"['Let', 'start', 'out', 'saying', 'book', 'LL', 'can', 'do', 'wrong', 'Even', 'worst', 'day', 'funnier', 'most', 'loving', 'Dirty', 'Girl', 'ran', 'out', 'bought', 'DVD', 'enjoyed', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'was', 'was', 'sophisticated', 'cutting', 'edge', 'previous', 'outings', 'concert', 'rely', 'too', 'heavily', 'name-calling', 'really', 'unfunny', 'knock-knock', 'type', 'jokes', 'have', 'less', 'interaction', 'audience', 'time', 'one', 'strengths', 'lives', 'shows', 'just', 'call', 'names', 'much', 'real', 'depth', 'few', 'moments', 'brilliance', 'rest', 'ok.', 'Also', 'Lisa', 'fans', 'are', 'not', 'easily', 'offended', 'felt', 'used', 'certain', 'derogatory', 'racial', 'slur', 'too', 'much', 'production', 'especially', 'was', 'not', 'connected', 'bit', 'was', 'just', 'used', 'cuss', 'someone', 'out', 'DVD', 'still', 'great', 'fun', 'not', 'must', 'own']",Long Live The Queen

KNOW IT ALL  ;-b ""DR SHOCK""","[5, 6]","With all the ""PC"" nonsense in this world today, it's nice to see a comedian who doesn't walk on egg shells or pull any punches. Lampanelli is like a female Don Rickles who isn't a racist, but enjoys poking fun at the differences in all of us.  While I didn't find this particular show to be one of the funniest I've seen, I did enjoy that fact that every race was given equal time with insults!
