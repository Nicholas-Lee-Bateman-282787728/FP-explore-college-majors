1369151,A3HP7JU4ZORF52,B003WH7AZ6,Anja Rebekka Schultze,"[21, 44]","I can honestly say that this is the most boring movie I have ever seen in my life. There is no story, no character development, no nothing. Now to be fair I have never been one for artistic movies, I see a film to be entertained, so perhaps people that like artsy movies will like this. I can however only describe what I think of this film, and to me this is nothing but a one and a half hour long s*** fest, it might be the worst movie I have seen in my life.Valhalla Rising is about a mysterious mute slave who is being used for gladiator style fights. He also seam to have the ability to predict the future through his dreams. Anyway he soon escapes and wanders aimlessly around together with another slave, a young boy who escaped with him. The pair team up with a group of Christians with more zeal than sense of direction. The Christians is looking for the holy land to join the crusade but end up in America instead.Now you might be thinking, this might make an excellent story, an escaped warrior slave who in addition is psychic and who may or may not come from Hel, a band of zealous crusaders, the myth that the Vikings discovered America before Columbus did. Well yes that could be great, but nothing happens, there is hardly any dialog, the characters are either killing one another of staring off into nothing, or tripping out on hallucinogens and dreaming that they are killing one another or having future visions where they are...you guessed it, killing one another. There is no reason, no storyline nothing.What this movie reminds me of is the 1970's acid movies, there are strange camera angels, crazy colors, trippy music, nonsensical scenes. If I am to compare it to anything it would be Vampyros Lesbos, nonsensical, artsy, trippy and completely unwatchable, the only difference is that here you have psychic Vikings instead of lesbian vampires.I do have to give the movie credit on one point, there are some beautiful nature shots in there. Other than that, like another reviewer said if what you are looking for is a poem or a painting in movie format then this movie might be for you.

Keeping a straight face while filming nonsense?After some truly silly violence showing, symbolically(?), what a great warrior One Eye is we discover that Dopey Blond Boy is, of course, suddenly telepathic. The viewer is then treated to a nails-on-chalkboard series of Vikings / underemployed-Scottish-actors adrift in a mist, occasionally dying from ennui & making grim faces at their sad, misty, becalmed state: alas, they cannot move their longboat.

To understand this film's aura, it should be noted it makes Terrence Malick's similarly-themedThe New Worldfeel like a summer blockbuster romp. Danish writer/director Nicolas Winding Refn has carved a bold name for himself with such challenging works asPusher TrilogyandBronson (Widescreen Edition), and this expedition into the muddy and bloody age of 1000 AD continues his refusal of convention.There is nothing pleasant about Refn's nightmarish world (filmed on location in Scotland) where men wear sodden rags, tromp through mud and wage wet battles to the death. An oppressive fog covers all, and scarred men stare quietly into space desperately searching for definition. Small campfires provide little warmth, and what few women are seen are naked and chained together as slaves. Harsh does not begin to scratch the surface of Refn's haunting imagery (aided by Morten Sborg's brilliant cinematography and a fascinating musical score of Peter Kyed and Peter Peter). Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen displays unique presence as a one-eyed viking, appropriately named One Eye. He's evidently a captive, residing in a wooden cage and carefully fed like a lion by the orphaned blond boy Are (Maarten Stevenson). On a regular basis, he's dragged from his prison, chained to a post and forced to fight to the death versus combatants while weary warlords sit nearby and wager the outcome. There are no cheers for his victories, punctuated by the sounds of crushed skulls and broken bones.One Eye eventually kills his captors and, with the boy gingerly trailing, silently travels cross country where they encounter a meager band of warriors who have converted to Christianity. They are preparing for a Crusade to Jerusalem, and reluctantly recruit One Eye, whose warrior legend precedes him. Soon, trapped on a meager long ship within a mysterious mist, they become hopelessly lost and depressed. The mists finally part, and before them is the ominous but sunny, tree-covered land of the new world. Quietly hiking through tall grasses, they encounter signs of Native Americans, including burial scaffolds and ghost-like arrows thumping into the bodies of unlucky comrades. These desperate vikings plant a tall, wooden cross in the virgin soil, utterly convinced they've arrived in Hell. Through it all, One Eye, with his boy sidekick in tow, silently leads the way through this mysterious world, disturbing even to him.""Valhalla Rising"" includes multiple dream sequences drenched in red, long continuous shots of wind-blown landscapes and ultimately, scenes of men sitting on rocks for minutes at a time staring into the void of quiet space. These are not spirited warriors by any stretch of the imagination, but terrified souls lost within the tides of worlds far more powerful than their swords. ""Valhalla Rising"" is a vision quest gone mad, completely lacking in the romantic conventions one expects from this period. ThinkThe Vikings, or to a far lessor extentPathfinderand the all-but-forgotten Lee Majors' B-flickThe Norseman, where lusty vikings fight slow-motion battle sequences against tribes of fierce Native Americans. You'll get none of that here.There are multiple inspirations Refn appears to be channeling, including Roman Polanski'sMacbeth, the already-mentioned Malick, Werner Herzog'sAguirre, the Wrath of Godand, perhaps most apparent of all, the experimental works of Kenneth Anger (The Films of Kenneth Anger, Vol. 2) including his famous filmLucifer Rising [VHS].I have always respected Anger's purposefully obscure films, where story is sacrificed for experimental, dream-like imagery. This is the true promised land of Refin's brutal journey. With a larger budget, he's taken Anger a step further, though fueled by equally potent doses of LSD. The minimum amount of dialog, usually raising more questions than answering, further carves a moody land of mystery and death. Insisting upon multiple interpretations, ""Valhalla Rising"" is an example of an incredibly gifted filmmaker reworking the tired conventions of period adventure, cutting through the surface, and pulling out the bloody results beneath.",4,A vision quest gone mad...,1286064000,"10 3, 2010",2010,4272,"['peculiar', 'fascinating', 'art', 'house', 'excursion', '2009', 'film', 'Valhalla', 'Rising', 'symbolic', 'viking', 'adventure', 'discovery', 'new', 'world', 'understand', 'film', 'aura', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'Terrence', 'Malick', 'similarly-themedThe', 'New', 'Worldfeel', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'romp', 'Danish', 'writer/director', 'Nicolas', 'Winding', 'Refn', 'carved', 'bold', 'name', 'such', 'challenging', 'works', 'asPusher', 'TrilogyandBronson', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'expedition', 'muddy', 'bloody', 'age', '1000', 'AD', 'refusal', 'convention.There', 'nothing', 'pleasant', 'Refn', 'nightmarish', 'world', 'filmed', 'location', 'Scotland', 'where', 'men', 'wear', 'sodden', 'rags', 'tromp', 'mud', 'wage', 'wet', 'battles', 'death', 'oppressive', 'fog', 'scarred', 'men', 'stare', 'quietly', 'space', 'desperately', 'searching', 'definition', 'Small', 'campfires', 'provide', 'little', 'warmth', 'what', 'few', 'women', 'are', 'seen', 'are', 'naked', 'chained', 'together', 'slaves', 'Harsh', 'not', 'begin', 'scratch', 'surface', 'Refn', 'haunting', 'imagery', 'aided', 'Morten', 'Sborg', 'brilliant', 'cinematography', 'fascinating', 'musical', 'score', 'Peter', 'Kyed', 'Peter', 'Peter', 'Danish', 'actor', 'Mads', 'Mikkelsen', 'unique', 'presence', 'one-eyed', 'viking', 'appropriately', 'named', 'One', 'Eye', 'evidently', 'captive', 'residing', 'wooden', 'cage', 'carefully', 'fed', 'lion', 'orphaned', 'blond', 'boy', 'Are', 'Maarten', 'Stevenson', 'regular', 'basis', 'dragged', 'prison', 'chained', 'post', 'forced', 'fight', 'death', 'versus', 'combatants', 'weary', 'warlords', 'sit', 'nearby', 'wager', 'outcome', 'are', 'cheers', 'victories', 'punctuated', 'sounds', 'crushed', 'skulls', 'broken', 'bones.One', 'Eye', 'eventually', 'captors', 'boy', 'gingerly', 'trailing', 'silently', 'cross', 'country', 'where', 'encounter', 'meager', 'band', 'warriors', 'who', 'have', 'converted', 'Christianity', 'are', 'preparing', 'Crusade', 'Jerusalem', 'reluctantly', 'recruit', 'One', 'Eye', 'warrior', 'legend', 'Soon', 'trapped', 'meager', 'long', 'ship', 'mysterious', 'mist', 'become', 'hopelessly', 'lost', 'depressed', 'mists', 'finally', 'part', 'ominous', 'sunny', 'tree-covered', 'land', 'new', 'world', 'Quietly', 'hiking', 'tall', 'grasses', 'encounter', 'signs', 'Native', 'Americans', 'including', 'burial', 'scaffolds', 'ghost-like', 'arrows', 'thumping', 'bodies', 'unlucky', 'comrades', 'desperate', 'vikings', 'plant', 'tall', 'wooden', 'cross', 'virgin', 'soil', 'utterly', 'convinced', ""'ve"", 'arrived', 'Hell', 'One', 'Eye', 'boy', 'sidekick', 'tow', 'silently', 'way', 'mysterious', 'world', 'disturbing', 'even', 'Valhalla', 'Rising', 'multiple', 'dream', 'sequences', 'drenched', 'red', 'long', 'continuous', 'shots', 'wind-blown', 'landscapes', 'ultimately', 'scenes', 'men', 'sitting', 'rocks', 'minutes', 'time', 'staring', 'void', 'quiet', 'space', 'are', 'not', 'spirited', 'warriors', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'terrified', 'souls', 'lost', 'tides', 'worlds', 'far', 'more', 'powerful', 'swords', 'Valhalla', 'Rising', 'vision', 'quest', 'gone', 'mad', 'completely', 'lacking', 'romantic', 'conventions', 'one', 'period', 'ThinkThe', 'Vikings', 'far', 'lessor', 'extentPathfinderand', 'all-but-forgotten', 'Lee', 'Majors', 'B-flickThe', 'Norseman', 'where', 'lusty', 'vikings', 'fight', 'slow-motion', 'battle', 'sequences', 'tribes', 'fierce', 'Native', 'Americans', ""'ll"", 'get', 'none', 'are', 'multiple', 'inspirations', 'Refn', 'be', 'channeling', 'including', 'Roman', ""Polanski'sMacbeth"", 'already-mentioned', 'Malick', 'Werner', ""Herzog'sAguirre"", 'Wrath', 'Godand', 'perhaps', 'most', 'apparent', 'experimental', 'works', 'Kenneth', 'Anger', 'Films', 'Kenneth', 'Anger', 'Vol', '2', 'including', 'famous', 'filmLucifer', 'Rising', '[', 'VHS', ']', '.I', 'have', 'always', 'respected', 'Anger', 'purposefully', 'obscure', 'films', 'where', 'story', 'sacrificed', 'experimental', 'dream-like', 'imagery', 'true', 'promised', 'land', 'Refin', 'brutal', 'journey', 'larger', 'budget', 'taken', 'Anger', 'step', 'further', 'fueled', 'equally', 'potent', 'doses', 'LSD', 'minimum', 'amount', 'dialog', 'usually', 'raising', 'more', 'questions', 'answering', 'further', 'moody', 'land', 'mystery', 'death', 'Insisting', 'multiple', 'interpretations', 'Valhalla', 'Rising', 'example', 'incredibly', 'gifted', 'filmmaker', 'reworking', 'tired', 'conventions', 'period', 'adventure', 'cutting', 'surface', 'pulling', 'out', 'bloody', 'results', 'beneath']",N/A

Valhalla Rising, a grandiose movie without a center and the pacing of a lame horse, could make a case for Nicolas Winding Refn being all three.Something like 1,000 years ago, One Eye (Mads Mikkelson), a mute warrior of great strength and cunning, is dragged around by a scurvy lot of Norsemen to fight brutal contests. Then he escapes, is aided by a young lad, catches a Viking boat to Jerusalem but is sidetracked by a great fog. He and his few companions wind up in the New World. There, a lot of them are killed by arrows.The movie takes 93 minutes. It feels like nine hours. There are many beautifully composed scenes of great natural beauty. As we linger on them and admire the director's good taste, the curiosity of where the movie is headed seeps out like gravy through a strainer. The violence perks things up a bit, but to what purpose, other than pandering, I don't know. See one flea-bitten wretch get his neck crunched and the others that follow are just echoes. I suppose some theologians might make a case for cynical religious values, but real life gives us plenty of those already.What is the point of the movie? There doesn't seem to be one except in the inchoate vision of Refn. What we have to admire is the performances of some fine actors, caked in dirt, wearing filthy furs and creaking leather, playing suspicious killers as they turn on each other with their broadswords. Mads Mikkelsen, an outstanding Danish actor, does what he can with no dialogue. Even so, we have no idea what motivates him, just our guesses. That's not enough.

It's was difficult for me to discern a message or even a point to this film besides appreciating the exceptional visuals.  Perhaps the message was that it was tough to be a Viking slave surrounded by mud, violence and ignorance?  The brief combat scenes were brutal as they were superbly choreographed and left me wishing for more.

Unfortunately, the strong imagery and music is the only thing this movie has going for it.  Thanks to director Nicolas Winding Refn's tedious pacing and frustrating editing, this visually intriguing film becomes an increasingly painful experience to even tolerate, let alone enjoy.  Featuring very little in the way of dialogue, character development, and action; the primitive narrative snails through its modest running time; leaving behind only a few head scratching spiritual metaphors for our trouble.  Save the distinct looking Mikkelsen who has nothing to do except stare out of his one good eye and a likable small boy, the rest of the cast are a faceless and forgettable lot.

I would wager it's not for most viewers, in fact.  Taking a somewhat controversial theme that seems somewhat overused and overaccepted these days (the Viking discovery of the New World) as well as overturning the Action Hero trope on its head (his Hero, ""One-Eye,"" does not only not speak but is pretty much impassive, is brutally effective in physical conflict, is feared by the Vikings he encounters due to some barely articulated reputation regarding murders within another clan, is regarded almost as hatred and death embodied, is coverered in strange tattoos and scars--and by the end of the film, we know pretty much as much about him as we did in the beginning!), director Refn attempts to throw convention on its head while simultaneously expanding the subject matter by showing man's search for redemption.  Which, in his hero One-Eye's ultimate death, may be less redemption than just a death of his own choosing.Certain questions are raised which are never answered, both simplistic (why doesn't One-Eye speak, as it's not discussed as to whether he cannot speak or simply refuses to speak) and more complex (if the Vikings believe the New World is hell, and that One-Eye is from hell, does that mean One-Eye is really from the New World, and has therefore returned home)?  Could he be a demonic agent, or even the Devil himself?  Is returning home a metaphor for redemption?  Metaphorically or actually, nothing is ever clear.  The dialogue is mediocre and actors have a tendency to talk past each other or about each other, rather than clearly communicating, and I think this contributes (quite deliberately, I'm sure, on the director's part) to creating this grand atmosphere of uncertainty.  To be honest, the film is often contrived and it's tedious at times, but it is also fairly enjoyable to observe.  Many times I felt more like an observer than a participant, which I suppose is not really a good thing--I generally feel a good film draws you into the story so you feel as if you are inhabiting the bodies or minds of the characters--but it is acceptable for the 2 hours of this film.  Be advised of brutal, graphic violence and (at times) simply inexplicable behavior (I'm speaking at this point about the rape of one Viking by another at the end of the film).Early into this movie I began to view it as a grad student's attempt to explain realism through a Viking saga.  When viewed as an attempt to explain political realism through an poorly applied version of the ""stag hunt"" game, the movie takes on a special, weird significance.  View each man as his own state, a person who can only responsibily concern himself with his own power and security, and the acts--from One-Eye's brutal domination of fighters sent against him in the beginning of the film to his adoption into the crusading group of Vikings (literally crusading--they mean to go to the Holy Land but, apparently, sleeping is not a good way to negotiate the ocean and the stumble into the New World), as well as the invariably, violently successful actions of the natives when the Vikings bumble into contact with the natives--take on a significance.  Even One-Eye's adoption of the boy as traveling companion (friend would be too strong a word, I think) increases One-Eye's relative power (by granting him the ability to communicate--though even this is confused, as it's not certain the boy really speaks for One-Eye, or if he simply speaks) through an alliance.  At the end of the film, when One-Eye has apparently decided it is his time to die, he simply abandons the boy, and his alliance, because it is no longer worthwhile.By the end of the film I was confused about redemption.  As I suppose, we all are!  I was not certain, in the end, this was really one of the points of the film.  The four most critical characters--a Christian proselytizer, his Viking chieftain friend, the boy, and One-Eye himself--all seemed concerned with it, and with the exception of the boy, all three seemed to demand it.  There are discussions of home, and returning there, but no one ever does.  Yet, the redemption-seekers die, and it was unclear if any of the three felt they'd attained it.  In the end, perhaps that's the greatest issue to be worked through.  Redemption is not always there to be had.",3,"Muddy, Bloody, and Strange",1317427200,"10 1, 2011",2011,4374,"['Bloody', 'muddy', 'quiet', 'cinematically', 'beautiful', 'Valhalla', 'Rising', 'not', 'everyone', 'would', 'wager', 'not', 'most', 'viewers', 'fact', 'Taking', 'somewhat', 'controversial', 'theme', 'somewhat', 'overused', 'overaccepted', 'days', 'Viking', 'discovery', 'New', 'World', 'as', 'well', 'overturning', 'Action', 'Hero', 'trope', 'head', 'Hero', 'One-Eye', 'not', 'only', 'not', 'speak', 'pretty', 'much', 'impassive', 'brutally', 'effective', 'physical', 'conflict', 'feared', 'Vikings', 'due', 'barely', 'articulated', 'reputation', 'regarding', 'murders', 'clan', 'regarded', 'almost', 'hatred', 'death', 'embodied', 'coverered', 'strange', 'tattoos', 'scars', 'end', 'film', 'know', 'pretty', 'much', 'much', 'did', 'beginning', 'director', 'Refn', 'throw', 'convention', 'head', 'simultaneously', 'expanding', 'subject', 'matter', 'showing', 'man', 'search', 'redemption', 'Which', 'hero', 'One-Eye', 'ultimate', 'death', 'may', 'be', 'less', 'redemption', 'just', 'death', 'own', 'choosing.Certain', 'questions', 'are', 'raised', 'are', 'never', 'answered', 'simplistic', 'why', ""n't"", 'One-Eye', 'speak', 'not', 'discussed', 'can', 'not', 'speak', 'simply', 'speak', 'more', 'complex', 'Vikings', 'believe', 'New', 'World', 'hell', 'One-Eye', 'hell', 'mean', 'One-Eye', 'really', 'New', 'World', 'therefore', 'returned', 'home', 'Could', 'be', 'demonic', 'agent', 'even', 'Devil', 'returning', 'home', 'metaphor', 'redemption', 'Metaphorically', 'actually', 'nothing', 'ever', 'clear', 'dialogue', 'mediocre', 'actors', 'have', 'tendency', 'talk', 'other', 'other', 'rather', 'clearly', 'communicating', 'think', 'contributes', 'quite', 'deliberately', ""'m"", 'sure', 'director', 'part', 'creating', 'grand', 'atmosphere', 'uncertainty', 'be', 'honest', 'film', 'often', 'contrived', 'tedious', 'times', 'also', 'fairly', 'enjoyable', 'observe', 'Many', 'times', 'felt', 'more', 'observer', 'participant', 'suppose', 'not', 'really', 'good', 'thing', 'generally', 'feel', 'good', 'film', 'draws', 'story', 'feel', 'are', 'inhabiting', 'bodies', 'minds', 'characters', 'acceptable', '2', 'hours', 'film', 'Be', 'advised', 'brutal', 'graphic', 'violence', 'times', 'simply', 'inexplicable', 'behavior', ""'m"", 'speaking', 'point', 'rape', 'one', 'Viking', 'end', 'film', '.Early', 'movie', 'began', 'view', 'grad', 'student', 'attempt', 'explain', 'realism', 'Viking', 'saga', 'When', 'viewed', 'attempt', 'explain', 'political', 'realism', 'poorly', 'applied', 'version', 'stag', 'hunt', 'game', 'movie', 'special', 'weird', 'significance', 'View', 'man', 'own', 'state', 'person', 'who', 'can', 'only', 'responsibily', 'concern', 'own', 'power', 'security', 'acts', 'One-Eye', 'brutal', 'domination', 'fighters', 'sent', 'beginning', 'film', 'adoption', 'crusading', 'group', 'Vikings', 'literally', 'crusading', 'mean', 'go', 'Holy', 'Land', 'apparently', 'sleeping', 'not', 'good', 'way', 'negotiate', 'ocean', 'stumble', 'New', 'World', 'as', 'well', 'invariably', 'violently', 'successful', 'actions', 'natives', 'when', 'Vikings', 'bumble', 'contact', 'natives', 'take', 'significance', 'Even', 'One-Eye', 'adoption', 'boy', 'traveling', 'companion', 'friend', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'strong', 'word', 'think', 'One-Eye', 'relative', 'power', 'granting', 'ability', 'communicate', 'even', 'confused', 'not', 'certain', 'boy', 'really', 'One-Eye', 'simply', 'alliance', 'end', 'film', 'when', 'One-Eye', 'apparently', 'decided', 'time', 'die', 'simply', 'boy', 'alliance', 'no', 'longer', 'worthwhile.By', 'end', 'film', 'was', 'confused', 'redemption', 'suppose', 'are', 'was', 'not', 'certain', 'end', 'was', 'really', 'one', 'points', 'film', 'four', 'most', 'critical', 'characters', 'Christian', 'proselytizer', 'Viking', 'chieftain', 'friend', 'boy', 'One-Eye', 'seemed', 'concerned', 'exception', 'boy', 'three', 'seemed', 'demand', 'are', 'discussions', 'home', 'returning', 'there', 'one', 'ever', 'redemption-seekers', 'die', 'was', 'unclear', 'three', 'felt', ""'d"", 'attained', 'end', 'perhaps', 'greatest', 'issue', 'be', 'worked', 'Redemption', 'not', 'always', 'be', 'had']",N/A

I'm glad I did.This is really kind of a weird movie. It's set in one of the Norse countries during the middle ages. There is a lot of mud and blood and a lot of dark skies. Mikkelson plays a slave. It seems he's had several masters over the years and they use him to win money for them by fighting other slaves. He's the best. he beats/ kills all his opponents. By a fluke he finds an arrowhead. He uses it to kill his owners, win his freedom, hook up with some other guys to head off to the Crusades. Weird weather causes them to go off course and they end up in the New World instead. It's all down hill from there.The first act is uncomfortable to watch. The people are brutes. The fights are viscious. You're always cold and dirty. There is no warmth or sunshine. The second act is a bit slow. They're stuck on a ship in waters with seemingly no current and a fog so heavy you can barely tell night from day. There are a lot of philosophical-religious discussion about God and life purpose and what have you. When they hit the new world in the third act things pick up again but, when it was all said and done, I'm not certain what the director/producers were getting at. It all seemed rather pointless.This movie does have some very artful touches. First is the near total lack of dialogue. Little is spoken. The Mikkelson character, One Eye (because he only has one useful eye) does not utter one word. The music has a very spooky/ethereal feel to it. In certain ways, this is like watching Herzog's 'Aguirre the Wrath of God.' When One Eye sees himself in visions, he's colored blood red and often pointing toward something unseen. Lots of stuff like that.This is not for the casual movie goer. It demands a lot of attention (and some patience) to make it through its rather trim 93 minutes. If you're more a fan of the middle of the road sort of flick then stay away.

The film takes place in 1000AD, when the entire population of the planet was under 300 million! It is a stark and harsh reality. Filmed entirely in Scotland in the winter, we get the bleak ambiance of Vikings and a Holy Crusade by a displaced band of Christians. I can't say the screenplay is superior. Where the film comes into its own is showing what it was like to live in these early times, when humans were merely wandering bands of native tribes one step beyond Neanderthal. Conditions were harsh and life had no more meaning than death. See Quest for Fire first. This is a film dated somewhere around 50,000BC in which we see bands of humanoid cave dwellers begin to emerge into human societies.

This is a thinking person's film, and don't get me wrong, there are some epic battle scenes, but that's not the focus or the point of this movie. If you look at reviews for this movie, you will find they are either very positive or very negative. That's probably due to false expectations of many people. For a good comparison, think THIN RED LINE vs. SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. There's a reason why some of the best actors on the planet worked for virtually nothing on THIN RED LINE. The end result was a masterpiece, but not everyone understood the movie. Instead of directly telling you how you should feel (such Saving Private Ryan did), THIN RED LINE passively brought that emotional response. I suppose some people just need to be told how to feel during a movie and need the movie to hold their hand through every step of the way. These same people, who don't want to think, and who can't open themselves up to the movie will also hate VALHALLA RISING. This is an astonishing movie about humanity. In my humble opinion this is a masterpiece. Despite being visually and acoustically amazing it is an in-depth look into mankind as it is rarely found.

Other times, in the real world, even when things were pretty slow (like in Part III), there's always the area and color palettes to enjoy (like the very beginning of Part IV). The cinematography of this film was outright beautiful. When things went slow, I took a moment to look at the beautiful landscapes surrounding our brooding men and definite anti-hero (I still think he was better in King Arthur) and the young boy that's One Eye's mouth (One Eye, no voice, go figure). Things seem to get a bit lost close to the end (not just the cast in the story), but in the end, things seem confusing, though I have the feeling I know what happened. And I believe the end is open to interpretation. Slow, yet appropriately, -paced, very few lines spoken (compared to every other movie with spoken lines), all standard filmmaking rules are broken, and, despite the name, there's no battle betweent he likes of Loki, Thor, Odin, Siv, Froya, Fenrir, of the rest of that gang.

1369231,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B003WH7AZ6,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[20, 33]","Our Netflix queue has been providing a steady stream of historical dramas about the Crusades, so we decided to watch something different with Valhalla Rising...and discovered that it's about a bunch of Norsemen who sail off to fight in the Crusades.  They never get there - that would make for a far more interesting movie - but instead land (SPOILER RISING) in North America where they encounter ""skraelings,"" hostile Native American warriors who aren't rolling out the red carpet for the accidental explorers.I've always thought the Norsemen vs. Native American conflicts were interesting stuff, and yet no director seems to be able to do the topic justice.  Pathfinder, which trod much of the same territory from the view of the Native Americans, was a flop.  I didn't think it was possible, but Valhalla Rising is actually worse.Our protagonist, if you can call him that, is a mute warrior/slave named One-Eye (Mads Mikkelsen). He is so dangerous that when he's not ripping peoples' throats out with his teeth, One-Eye spends his time trussed up in a cage.  Only a young slave boy named Are (Maarten Stevenson) is allowed to go near him; I like to think this is because One-Eye was once a father and has a code against killing children, but I'm probably giving director and scriptwriter Nicolas Winding Refn too much credit. Refn's got grander goals in mind for Valhalla Rising.After slaughtering his captors in graphic fashion, complete with bright red CGI blood, One-Eye comes upon a small group of Norse crusaders. Led by The General (Ewan Stewart), they have one of the stupidest plans in history: to go on the Crusades by sailing off in a random destination.The film is broken down into parts, so it was easy to determine the moment when the film lost me: Part III Men of God. Up to that point I was tolerating the repeated flashforwards (presumably One-Eye's visions), the long still shots of people staring off into space in the foreground while people stare off into space in the background, and the blood red-tinted shots of people staring off into space.  There's no score to speak of, just occasional musical riffs for tension, and there's almost no dialogue to speak of either (One Eye's mute, remember?).  There's literally nothing to speak of.Part III consists of the men slowly going mad in the fog as they jet off to the Crusades.  These are Norsemen who show an astounding lack of navigational skill.  There's no compelling reason for One-Eye to join them.  Indeed, given that he hates just about everybody except the boy, you'd think he'd avoid being trapped with a bunch of morons who haven't the first clue how to sail. But no, One-Eye joins them and so do we, spending each agonizing moment waiting for them all to die.Unfortunately, they don't.  Instead, they land somewhere near North America (maybe Greenland? I stopped caring).  Are these not the worst Norsemen sailors ever?  When an arrow pierces one of the Norsemen from seemingly nowhere, the crew and the audience begins to believe they are in hell.  And for all intents and purposes, we are.What ensues is a beat-you-over-the-head allegory for Christianity vs. paganism.  After finally getting around to slaughtering the rest of the group, One-Eye heads out on his own. The now completely mad General stays behind to establish a new Jerusalem. The priest of the group (Gary Lewis) is literally backstabbed by the General, but stumbles on to follow One-Eye into the wilderness.Where is he going? What is his plan?  Since One-Eye is a symbolic manifestation of the pagan spirit, he apparently doesn't need motivation.  He's a force of nature, a representation of Odin, and he must die for our sins. Fans of Norse history know this will not end well.Symbolism can't save this film. The dreadfully long stills, the lack of dialogue, and the cartoonish violence all amount to an art film with a capital ""A"". This is a message movie gussied up as a historical piece.  Its religious symbolism can be reduced to an inverted Christ allegory.  In the film, it's the pagan who must sacrifice himself for our sins; in reality, it's the audience's patience that suffers most.",1,A hellish journey for everyone involved,1329609600,"02 19, 2012",2012,4147,"['Netflix', 'queue', 'been', 'providing', 'steady', 'stream', 'historical', 'dramas', 'Crusades', 'decided', 'watch', 'something', 'different', 'Valhalla', 'Rising', 'discovered', 'bunch', 'Norsemen', 'who', 'sail', 'fight', 'Crusades', 'never', 'get', 'there', 'would', 'make', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'movie', 'instead', 'land', 'SPOILER', 'RISING', 'North', 'America', 'where', 'encounter', 'skraelings', 'hostile', 'Native', 'American', 'warriors', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'rolling', 'out', 'red', 'carpet', 'accidental', 'explorers.I', ""'ve"", 'always', 'thought', 'Norsemen', 'vs', 'Native', 'American', 'conflicts', 'were', 'interesting', 'stuff', 'yet', 'director', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'topic', 'justice', 'Pathfinder', 'trod', 'much', 'same', 'territory', 'view', 'Native', 'Americans', 'was', 'flop', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'possible', 'Valhalla', 'Rising', 'actually', 'worse.Our', 'protagonist', 'can', 'call', 'mute', 'warrior/slave', 'named', 'One-Eye', 'Mads', 'Mikkelsen', 'so', 'dangerous', 'when', 'not', 'ripping', 'peoples', 'throats', 'out', 'teeth', 'One-Eye', 'time', 'trussed', 'up', 'cage', 'Only', 'young', 'slave', 'boy', 'named', 'Are', 'Maarten', 'Stevenson', 'allowed', 'go', 'like', 'think', 'One-Eye', 'was', 'once', 'father', 'code', 'killing', 'children', ""'m"", 'probably', 'giving', 'director', 'scriptwriter', 'Nicolas', 'Winding', 'Refn', 'too', 'much', 'credit', 'Refn', 'got', 'grander', 'goals', 'mind', 'Valhalla', 'Rising.After', 'slaughtering', 'captors', 'graphic', 'fashion', 'complete', 'bright', 'red', 'CGI', 'blood', 'One-Eye', 'small', 'group', 'Norse', 'crusaders', 'Led', 'General', 'Ewan', 'Stewart', 'have', 'one', 'stupidest', 'plans', 'history', 'go', 'Crusades', 'sailing', 'off', 'random', 'destination.The', 'film', 'broken', 'down', 'parts', 'was', 'easy', 'determine', 'moment', 'when', 'film', 'lost', 'Part', 'III', 'Men', 'God', 'Up', 'point', 'was', 'tolerating', 'repeated', 'flashforwards', 'presumably', 'One-Eye', 'visions', 'long', 'still', 'shots', 'people', 'staring', 'off', 'space', 'foreground', 'people', 'stare', 'space', 'background', 'blood', 'red-tinted', 'shots', 'people', 'staring', 'off', 'space', 'score', 'speak', 'just', 'occasional', 'musical', 'riffs', 'tension', 'almost', 'dialogue', 'speak', 'One', 'Eye', 'mute', 'remember', 'literally', 'nothing', 'speak', 'of.Part', 'III', 'men', 'slowly', 'going', 'mad', 'fog', 'jet', 'Crusades', 'are', 'Norsemen', 'who', 'show', 'astounding', 'lack', 'navigational', 'skill', 'compelling', 'reason', 'One-Eye', 'join', 'Indeed', 'given', 'just', 'everybody', 'boy', ""'d"", 'think', ""'d"", 'avoid', 'being', 'trapped', 'bunch', 'morons', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'first', 'clue', 'how', 'sail', 'One-Eye', 'so', 'do', 'spending', 'agonizing', 'moment', 'waiting', 'die.Unfortunately', 'do', ""n't"", 'Instead', 'land', 'somewhere', 'North', 'America', 'maybe', 'Greenland', 'stopped', 'caring', 'Are', 'not', 'worst', 'Norsemen', 'sailors', 'ever', 'When', 'arrow', 'one', 'Norsemen', 'seemingly', 'nowhere', 'crew', 'audience', 'believe', 'are', 'hell', 'intents', 'purposes', 'are.What', 'ensues', 'beat-you-over-the-head', 'allegory', 'Christianity', 'vs.', 'paganism', 'finally', 'getting', 'around', 'slaughtering', 'rest', 'group', 'One-Eye', 'out', 'own', 'now', 'completely', 'mad', 'General', 'establish', 'new', 'Jerusalem', 'priest', 'group', 'Gary', 'Lewis', 'literally', 'backstabbed', 'General', 'stumbles', 'follow', 'One-Eye', 'wilderness.Where', 'going', 'What', 'plan', 'One-Eye', 'symbolic', 'manifestation', 'pagan', 'spirit', 'apparently', ""n't"", 'need', 'motivation', 'force', 'nature', 'representation', 'Odin', 'must', 'die', 'sins', 'Fans', 'Norse', 'history', 'know', 'will', 'not', 'end', 'well.Symbolism', 'ca', ""n't"", 'save', 'film', 'dreadfully', 'long', 'stills', 'lack', 'dialogue', 'cartoonish', 'violence', 'amount', 'art', 'film', 'capital', 'message', 'movie', 'gussied', 'up', 'historical', 'piece', 'religious', 'symbolism', 'can', 'be', 'reduced', 'inverted', 'Christ', 'allegory', 'film', 'pagan', 'who', 'must', 'sacrifice', 'sins', 'reality', 'audience', 'patience', 'most']",N/A

It left me bewildered, wondering what the purpose of this film was - which may very well be its purpose.The story's main character is a man with only one eye, hence nicknamed One Eye by his caretaker, a young boy whose name, if he had one, I have forgotten. One Eye is some sort of gladiator. He looks different from his captors, who we learn are Scottish, and may be a Viking, but we never know for sure because he doesn't speak. The only thing we learn about him is that he is a killer who has never lost a fight.After several years of captivity and slavery, One Eye finds something that helps him escape. Followed by his caretaker, who also serves as his ""interpreter"" of sorts (since One Eye doesn't speak, the boy mainly interprets his facial expressions - and makes up stuff as he goes along), he encounters a group of Scottish crusaders on their way to the Holy Land. We never find out exactly what motivates One Eye to join them. His actions seem guided by flashbacks (which we later find out are actually glimpses of the future) and in the end, there seems no point to them.This is definitely an unusual film that sort of creeps up on you and keeps you watching because of its slow, breathtaking landscape shots (combined with a soundtrack that I found very disturbing at times) - but mostly because you want to see if anything is ever going to happen. And things do happen - just not the way you expect them to, which is what I liked about the movie.

Because a lot of people still don't seem to get it, here's a capsule explanation of exactly what happens in the film, from someone who examines evidence of crimes and from that puts together suspects' MOs, serial killer methodologies, etc:A mute slave, One Eye, is forced by his captors to fight. One day, he finds an old arrowhead by submerging himself in a waterpool located on some mountain upland, after having a dream about the event. Later, One Eye uses the arrowhead to free himself and kill his captors. From this, his mind forms an abstract construct about submersion in water giving him the key that unlocks his freedom. An unnamed slave boy accompanies the newly freed One Eye, and they encounter a group of Christian Scots-Gaelic warriors who are on their way to the Crusades. One Eye and the boy board the Christians' ship, and with them sail away into a dense sea fog that does not lift until they find their ship has somehow left the sea and floated inland along the course of an unnamed river. Their location is uncertain and soon becomes a point of contention among the travelers.In this unfamiliar land, One Eye and his companions encounter some signs of human habitation: raised wooden biers holding decayed corpses and tribal religious paraphernalia stand in a lightly wooded area. Pay attention here, and you can see near this location a waterpool or small pond with the trunk of a dead, sun-bleached tree rising out of the water, or from the shore. There is a scene where the group is approaching the biers, and the waterpool/tree is there between them and the biers; another waterpool/dead tree tableau can be seen briefly for a moment behind and to the right of the leader of the Christian warriors. One Eye somehow makes the connection that these waterpool/dead tree tableaus have spiritual significance to the land's native inhabitants, else they wouldn't have chosen to honor their dead in that place.Later, the leader of the Christian warriors, who was allowed to travel through the unnamed land unmolested up until that point, is shot dead with arrows while standing waist-deep in a small pond. Note: to his left stands a dead, sun-bleached tree rising out of the water. Was the warrior-leader shot for violating the native inhabitants' ""holy ground"" by standing in the pond?Recall the earlier scene in which all of the characters drink some unnamed psychoactive liquor from a carved wooden bottle, and then all proceed to succumb to various kinds of drug-induced mania and/or religious ecstasy on the shores of a still lagoon. After drinking, One Eye glances over his shoulder toward a distant rocky promontory, where the native inhabitants are presumed to be hiding and watching; One Eye does this to let them know he's aware they are there.Then, standing apart from the maddened, drug-dazed crowd, One Eye constructs a column-like structure of stones on a small islet near the shores of the lagoon. Note that when he begins this task, One Eye sets the first stone atop the stump of a dead tree. He is sending the watching tribesmen the message that he understands their religion: he knows what their holy places are, where spirits are presumed to dwell. And so One Eye himself constructs a new ""holy place.""At the end of the film, before One Eye is beaten to death, he envisions himself (his spirit?) walking into the waters of that lagoon where he built the stone column; then he (or his spirit) is submerged, the head disappearing under the water's surface, like he did near the beginning of the film when he found the arrowhead that eventually aided him in freeing himself. Only this time, the audience is supposed to surmise that the freedom One Eye seeks (and gets, through the death of his physical body) is spiritual freedom, as opposed to his physical freedom earlier. One Eye's physical body dies, and his spirit enters the waters of the lagoon where he built the ""holy place"" marker, to become one of the native inhabitants' gods.",5,Police detective offers an explanation of the film,1295568000,"01 21, 2011",2011,4047,"['Ok', 'do', ""n't"", 'read', 'review', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'Valhalla', 'Rising', 'lot', 'people', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'here', 'capsule', 'explanation', 'exactly', 'what', 'film', 'someone', 'who', 'evidence', 'crimes', 'together', 'suspects', 'MOs', 'serial', 'killer', 'methodologies', 'etc', 'mute', 'slave', 'One', 'Eye', 'forced', 'captors', 'fight', 'One', 'day', 'old', 'arrowhead', 'submerging', 'waterpool', 'located', 'mountain', 'upland', 'having', 'dream', 'event', 'Later', 'One', 'Eye', 'arrowhead', 'free', 'kill', 'captors', 'mind', 'abstract', 'construct', 'submersion', 'water', 'giving', 'key', 'freedom', 'unnamed', 'slave', 'boy', 'newly', 'freed', 'One', 'Eye', 'encounter', 'group', 'Christian', 'Scots-Gaelic', 'warriors', 'who', 'are', 'way', 'Crusades', 'One', 'Eye', 'boy', 'board', 'Christians', 'ship', 'sail', 'away', 'dense', 'sea', 'fog', 'not', 'lift', 'find', 'ship', 'somehow', 'left', 'sea', 'floated', 'inland', 'course', 'unnamed', 'river', 'location', 'uncertain', 'soon', 'point', 'contention', 'travelers.In', 'unfamiliar', 'land', 'One', 'Eye', 'companions', 'encounter', 'signs', 'human', 'habitation', 'raised', 'wooden', 'biers', 'holding', 'decayed', 'corpses', 'tribal', 'religious', 'paraphernalia', 'stand', 'lightly', 'wooded', 'area', 'Pay', 'attention', 'here', 'can', 'see', 'location', 'waterpool', 'small', 'pond', 'trunk', 'dead', 'sun-bleached', 'tree', 'rising', 'water', 'shore', 'scene', 'where', 'group', 'approaching', 'biers', 'waterpool/tree', 'there', 'biers', 'waterpool/dead', 'tree', 'tableau', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'briefly', 'moment', 'behind', 'right', 'leader', 'Christian', 'warriors', 'One', 'Eye', 'somehow', 'connection', 'waterpool/dead', 'tree', 'tableaus', 'have', 'spiritual', 'significance', 'land', 'native', 'inhabitants', 'else', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'chosen', 'honor', 'dead', 'place.Later', 'leader', 'Christian', 'warriors', 'who', 'was', 'allowed', 'travel', 'unnamed', 'land', 'unmolested', 'up', 'point', 'shot', 'dead', 'arrows', 'standing', 'waist-deep', 'small', 'pond', 'Note', 'left', 'dead', 'sun-bleached', 'tree', 'rising', 'water', 'Was', 'warrior-leader', 'shot', 'violating', 'native', 'inhabitants', 'holy', 'ground', 'standing', 'pond', 'earlier', 'scene', 'characters', 'drink', 'unnamed', 'psychoactive', 'liquor', 'carved', 'wooden', 'bottle', 'then', 'proceed', 'succumb', 'various', 'kinds', 'drug-induced', 'mania', 'and/or', 'religious', 'ecstasy', 'shores', 'still', 'lagoon', 'drinking', 'One', 'Eye', 'over', 'shoulder', 'distant', 'rocky', 'promontory', 'where', 'native', 'inhabitants', 'are', 'presumed', 'be', 'hiding', 'watching', 'One', 'Eye', 'let', 'know', 'aware', 'are', 'there.Then', 'standing', 'apart', 'maddened', 'drug-dazed', 'crowd', 'One', 'Eye', 'column-like', 'structure', 'stones', 'small', 'islet', 'shores', 'lagoon', 'Note', 'when', 'task', 'One', 'Eye', 'first', 'stone', 'atop', 'stump', 'dead', 'tree', 'sending', 'watching', 'tribesmen', 'message', 'religion', 'what', 'holy', 'places', 'are', 'where', 'spirits', 'are', 'presumed', 'dwell', 'so', 'One', 'Eye', 'new', 'holy', 'place', 'end', 'film', 'One', 'Eye', 'beaten', 'death', 'spirit', 'walking', 'waters', 'lagoon', 'where', 'built', 'stone', 'column', 'then', 'spirit', 'submerged', 'head', 'disappearing', 'water', 'surface', 'did', 'beginning', 'film', 'when', 'found', 'arrowhead', 'eventually', 'aided', 'freeing', 'Only', 'time', 'audience', 'supposed', 'surmise', 'freedom', 'One', 'Eye', 'seeks', 'death', 'physical', 'body', 'spiritual', 'freedom', 'opposed', 'physical', 'freedom', 'earlier', 'One', 'Eye', 'physical', 'body', 'dies', 'spirit', 'waters', 'lagoon', 'where', 'built', 'holy', 'place', 'marker', 'become', 'one', 'native', 'inhabitants', 'gods']",N/A

1369246,A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ,B003WH7AZ6,Robert Blake,"[13, 17]","""Valhalla Rising"" plays like a bizarre hybrid of Terrence Malick and Mel Gibson, it wants to tell a gritty tale of vikings and the Crusades while keeping a visually poetic, dreamlike tone. It's a hard task and director Nicolas Winding Refn almost pulls it off but never makes it to the finish line. When it comes to narrative the film is not a complete success, but it is worth watching for its textures. In this age of recycled commercialism, it is refreshing to see a director like Refn attempt something more original and different.The story basically follows a one-eyed character played by Mads Mikkelsen who finds himself captured by local warlords. After escaping with a blonde boy as his companion, ""One Eyed"" bumps into a group of Crusaders on their way to the Holy Land. One Eyed is recruited for the journey and after a trippy, myst-plagued journey by boat, the crusaders and One Eyed find themselves in a lush, forest land which we immediately discover is the then undiscovered America. What follwos is a descent into madness as indigenous inhabitants begin killing off members of the crusader group and others become drunk with fantasies of power and conquest.Recently there has been a rise in sword and sandle movies with very bleached cinematography, cheesy dialogue and over the top gore, a perfect example is the recent ""Centurion."" With ""Valhalla Rising"" Refn keeps some of the bleached look and gore, but tones it down, preferring instead gorgeous, haunting vistas and patient, beautifully structured shots. The visuals alone make the film worth watching. There are grand, mysty European landscapes and the actors are framed in shots that look taken out of Frazetta paintings. The editing in this film is not frantic, like the films of Terrence Malick or David Gordon Green it tries to create a kind of hypnotic rhythm. You get the sense Refn wasn't trying to tell a story so much as set a mood, like music, and here the sound design is also crucial. The music by Peter Peter Schneifderman and Peter Kyed is atmospheric, it never quickens or pounds. Unlike the typical film in this genre this one also leaps into surrealism at times, mixing reality with stunning dream sequences that look like a Viking fantasy tinged with absinthe.What keeps ""Valhalla Rising"" from being a great film is that Refn seems to have focused more on the images and tone than fleshing a story that was fully worthy of this technique. Malick, Kubrick and Green's work is noteworthy because they combine strong writing with their visual poetry. Here we get a lot of surface but little depth. For example the main character is never allowed to truly establish a strong identity, the fact that he's mute doesn't help much because the character vacuum created by that touch is never properly filled in. The dialogue is very sparse, which isn't the problem, the problem is that if Refn planned to have such little dialogue he should have at least given the characters better things to say when they do speak up. Instead we are treated to very geeky dialogue that never feels real, more like the kind of thing heavy metal fans used to scribble in their high school notebooks back in the 80s. What does save the characters is that they are well casted, and when Refn sticks to his quiet, beautifully-framed sections the actors have real presence, especially Mikkelsen who stays in the memory. But you do wish he would speak up, this character seems like the type a good actor would have a great time bringing to life.So aside from the poor dialogue, ""Valhalla Rising"" is still a film that tries to be different in its structure and composition. Despite its flaws it does reach some impressive visual heights. Refn should be commended for not producing another 2-hour bloodbath. There is brutal violence in this film, but it doesn't dominate the entire running time and plays more like footnotes. What stays in the memory are the sights. Many directors don't bother to try and actually produce cinema these days, Refn at least seems to be truly trying to use the camera. ""Valhalla Rising"" shows us something new, and that's something you won't get from ""Battle: Los Angeles.""",4,A Film That Thrives On Its Texture.,1299974400,"03 13, 2011",2011,4161,"['Valhalla', 'Rising', 'plays', 'bizarre', 'hybrid', 'Terrence', 'Malick', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'tell', 'gritty', 'tale', 'vikings', 'Crusades', 'keeping', 'visually', 'poetic', 'dreamlike', 'tone', 'hard', 'task', 'director', 'Nicolas', 'Winding', 'Refn', 'almost', 'off', 'never', 'finish', 'line', 'When', 'narrative', 'film', 'not', 'complete', 'success', 'worth', 'watching', 'textures', 'age', 'recycled', 'commercialism', 'refreshing', 'see', 'director', 'Refn', 'attempt', 'something', 'more', 'original', 'different.The', 'story', 'basically', 'one-eyed', 'character', 'played', 'Mads', 'Mikkelsen', 'who', 'captured', 'local', 'warlords', 'escaping', 'blonde', 'boy', 'companion', 'One', 'Eyed', 'group', 'Crusaders', 'way', 'Holy', 'Land', 'One', 'Eyed', 'recruited', 'journey', 'trippy', 'myst-plagued', 'journey', 'boat', 'crusaders', 'One', 'Eyed', 'find', 'lush', 'forest', 'land', 'immediately', 'discover', 'then', 'undiscovered', 'America', 'What', 'follwos', 'descent', 'madness', 'indigenous', 'inhabitants', 'begin', 'killing', 'off', 'members', 'crusader', 'group', 'others', 'become', 'drunk', 'fantasies', 'power', 'conquest.Recently', 'been', 'rise', 'sword', 'sandle', 'movies', 'very', 'bleached', 'cinematography', 'cheesy', 'dialogue', 'top', 'gore', 'perfect', 'example', 'recent', 'Centurion', 'Valhalla', 'Rising', 'Refn', 'bleached', 'look', 'gore', 'down', 'preferring', 'instead', 'gorgeous', 'haunting', 'vistas', 'patient', 'beautifully', 'structured', 'shots', 'visuals', 'alone', 'make', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'are', 'grand', 'mysty', 'European', 'landscapes', 'actors', 'are', 'framed', 'shots', 'look', 'taken', 'Frazetta', 'paintings', 'editing', 'film', 'not', 'frantic', 'films', 'Terrence', 'Malick', 'David', 'Gordon', 'Green', 'create', 'kind', 'hypnotic', 'rhythm', 'get', 'sense', 'Refn', 'was', ""n't"", 'trying', 'tell', 'story', 'so', 'much', 'set', 'mood', 'music', 'here', 'sound', 'design', 'also', 'crucial', 'music', 'Peter', 'Peter', 'Schneifderman', 'Peter', 'Kyed', 'atmospheric', 'never', 'pounds', 'typical', 'film', 'genre', 'one', 'also', 'surrealism', 'times', 'mixing', 'reality', 'stunning', 'dream', 'sequences', 'look', 'Viking', 'fantasy', 'tinged', 'Valhalla', 'Rising', 'being', 'great', 'film', 'Refn', 'have', 'focused', 'more', 'images', 'tone', 'fleshing', 'story', 'was', 'fully', 'worthy', 'technique', 'Malick', 'Kubrick', 'Green', 'work', 'noteworthy', 'combine', 'strong', 'writing', 'visual', 'poetry', 'Here', 'get', 'lot', 'surface', 'little', 'depth', 'example', 'main', 'character', 'never', 'allowed', 'truly', 'establish', 'strong', 'identity', 'fact', 'mute', ""n't"", 'help', 'much', 'character', 'vacuum', 'created', 'touch', 'never', 'properly', 'filled', 'dialogue', 'very', 'sparse', ""n't"", 'problem', 'problem', 'Refn', 'planned', 'have', 'such', 'little', 'dialogue', 'should', 'have', 'least', 'given', 'characters', 'better', 'things', 'say', 'when', 'do', 'speak', 'up', 'Instead', 'are', 'treated', 'very', 'geeky', 'dialogue', 'never', 'feels', 'real', 'more', 'kind', 'thing', 'heavy', 'metal', 'fans', 'used', 'scribble', 'high', 'school', 'notebooks', 'back', '80s', 'What', 'save', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'casted', 'when', 'Refn', 'quiet', 'beautifully-framed', 'sections', 'actors', 'have', 'real', 'presence', 'especially', 'Mikkelsen', 'who', 'memory', 'do', 'wish', 'would', 'speak', 'up', 'character', 'type', 'good', 'actor', 'would', 'have', 'great', 'time', 'bringing', 'life.So', 'aside', 'poor', 'dialogue', 'Valhalla', 'Rising', 'still', 'film', 'be', 'different', 'structure', 'composition', 'flaws', 'reach', 'impressive', 'visual', 'heights', 'Refn', 'should', 'be', 'commended', 'not', 'producing', '2-hour', 'bloodbath', 'brutal', 'violence', 'film', ""n't"", 'dominate', 'entire', 'running', 'time', 'more', 'footnotes', 'What', 'memory', 'are', 'sights', 'Many', 'directors', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'try', 'actually', 'produce', 'cinema', 'days', 'Refn', 'least', 'be', 'truly', 'trying', 'use', 'camera', 'Valhalla', 'Rising', 'something', 'new', 'something', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'Battle', 'Los', 'Angeles']",N/A

This is a man who, if he were suddenly found in our modern society, would be institutionalized; probably spending most of his existence in solitary confinement because the scars that cover much of his face and body are probably nothing compared with those that have been inflicted on his spirit resulting in a man who's only superficially human.After making a violent escape from a life of gladiatorial slavery and joining up with a group of opportunistic crusaders in Part II (the film is actually subdivided into parts like acts in a play) he is suddenly confronted by one of the group, whose religion goes deeper than a symbol worn around his neck, who actually seems interested in his spiritual welfare.  The one-sided conversation seems to trigger a return to some level of humanity that's been buried deep beneath revenge and animal intuition for anybody's guess how long, and is probably what motivates his actions at the finish of the film. There is a sort of clairvoyant sub-text throughout this movie (owing to the minimalist dialogue) between the central character and those at either a more primal or innocent level; hence the empathy between the warrior and the boy at one extreme and the respect granted by the natives in Part VI.This is one of those films that makes you have to dig a little and, as with all good fiction, is partly subject to interpretation and a good source for discussion if you're into that sort of thing.  :o)",4,Violent but Thought-provoking,1353974400,"11 27, 2012",2012,1815,"['Valhalla', 'Rising', 'surreal', 'incredibly', 'brutal', 'tale', 'one', 'man', 'journey', 'enslavement', 'liberation', 'unforgiving', 'world.Little', 'revealed', 'central', 'character', 'name', 'film', 'reference', 'Norse', 'paradise', 'so', 'suspect', 'culture', 'furthermore', 'Berserker', 'based', 'almost', 'superhuman', 'fighting', 'abilities', 'man', 'who', 'were', 'suddenly', 'found', 'modern', 'society', 'would', 'be', 'institutionalized', 'probably', 'spending', 'most', 'existence', 'solitary', 'confinement', 'scars', 'cover', 'much', 'face', 'body', 'are', 'probably', 'nothing', 'compared', 'have', 'been', 'inflicted', 'spirit', 'resulting', 'man', 'who', 'only', 'superficially', 'human.After', 'making', 'violent', 'escape', 'life', 'gladiatorial', 'slavery', 'joining', 'up', 'group', 'opportunistic', 'crusaders', 'Part', 'II', 'film', 'actually', 'subdivided', 'parts', 'acts', 'play', 'suddenly', 'confronted', 'one', 'group', 'religion', 'deeper', 'symbol', 'worn', 'neck', 'who', 'actually', 'interested', 'spiritual', 'welfare', 'one-sided', 'conversation', 'trigger', 'return', 'level', 'humanity', 'been', 'buried', 'deep', 'beneath', 'revenge', 'animal', 'intuition', 'anybody', 'guess', 'how', 'long', 'probably', 'what', 'actions', 'finish', 'film', 'sort', 'clairvoyant', 'sub-text', 'movie', 'owing', 'minimalist', 'dialogue', 'central', 'character', 'more', 'primal', 'innocent', 'level', 'hence', 'empathy', 'warrior', 'boy', 'one', 'extreme', 'respect', 'granted', 'natives', 'Part', 'VI.This', 'one', 'films', 'have', 'dig', 'little', 'good', 'fiction', 'partly', 'subject', 'interpretation', 'good', 'source', 'discussion', ""'re"", 'sort', 'thing', 'o']",N/A

This film will show you the true nature and even their ugly violent sides, without holding anything back. Also one of the main things I loved about the film is that it's very slow-paced, and almost has an arthouse feel to it. It's very atmospheric, tranquil, and it takes you to a whole another world. The only personal complaint I had with this film was that it was in English. It was a Scottish English, but English nonetheless. I really wished they could have done it in the ancient Nordic tongue.

At least in the US it has been more honest, so is it any good really?It is an unusual film a sort of Ingmar Bergman meets Derek Jarman only with a better camera. It is supposed to be a fantasy and as such it is hard to work out what the actual plot is. Starring Mads Mikkelsen as a one eyed sort of prize fighter, he is treated like an animal only let out for fight to the death. He apparently is owned by Barde(I got that from the cover), who is a wealthy Scotsman who obtained him for his fighting skills. If he is such a lethal fighting machine, how was he ever caught?Any way he escapes; killing everyone except a young lad who comes along and appears to be able to understand the mute `One Eye'. I thought it was going to be a Christian versus Pagan type thing as Christianity is a thread throughout the film. The old sort of Christianity mind, crusading and killing; not the modern sort of caring and turning the other cheek etc. They meet up with some would be crusaders and then go off on a strange voyage to either the Holy Land of to establish a New Jerusalem.This is a slow, often claustrophobic, stylish and atmospheric film. Writer and director Nicholas Winding Refn clearly knew what he wanted to create; the studio I think had different ideas. He uses music and imagery to drive the narrative forward and whilst it works, the swift and violent changes in pace -there are snippets of violent flask backs and/or premonitions- actually break your concentration. It is like being hooked and somehow getting off the line. It is only 86 minutes long, but does seem a whole lot longer and it leaves so much unanswered that I was left undecided as to whether this is an excellent art house film, that I was unable to get; or slightly disjointed and possibly overly self indulgent. A sort of triumph of style over substance. In the end I think it is somewhere between the two, hence the three stars. Please don't get me wrong I do not think this is a bad film and I shall want to see it again, but that I cannot say that I `loved it' and that is great because I am pretty sure that is not the emotion the makers were aiming for.",3,Slow but oddly interesting,1307750400,"06 11, 2011",2011,2235,"['was', 'mis', 'sold', 'UK', 'pretending', 'be', 'Viking', 'epic', 'recieved', 'harsh', 'criticism', 'least', 'US', 'been', 'more', 'honest', 'so', 'good', 'really', 'unusual', 'film', 'sort', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'Derek', 'Jarman', 'only', 'better', 'camera', 'supposed', 'be', 'fantasy', 'such', 'hard', 'work', 'out', 'what', 'actual', 'plot', 'Starring', 'Mads', 'Mikkelsen', 'one', 'eyed', 'sort', 'prize', 'fighter', 'treated', 'animal', 'only', 'out', 'fight', 'death', 'apparently', 'owned', 'Barde', 'got', 'cover', 'who', 'wealthy', 'Scotsman', 'who', 'obtained', 'fighting', 'skills', 'such', 'lethal', 'fighting', 'machine', 'how', 'was', 'ever', 'caught', 'way', 'killing', 'everyone', 'young', 'lad', 'who', 'along', 'be', 'able', 'understand', 'mute', 'One', 'Eye', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'Christian', 'versus', 'Pagan', 'type', 'thing', 'Christianity', 'thread', 'film', 'old', 'sort', 'Christianity', 'mind', 'crusading', 'killing', 'not', 'modern', 'sort', 'caring', 'turning', 'other', 'cheek', 'etc', 'meet', 'up', 'would', 'be', 'crusaders', 'then', 'go', 'off', 'strange', 'voyage', 'either', 'Holy', 'Land', 'establish', 'New', 'Jerusalem.This', 'slow', 'often', 'claustrophobic', 'stylish', 'atmospheric', 'film', 'Writer', 'director', 'Nicholas', 'Winding', 'Refn', 'clearly', 'knew', 'what', 'wanted', 'create', 'studio', 'think', 'had', 'different', 'ideas', 'music', 'imagery', 'drive', 'narrative', 'forward', 'whilst', 'swift', 'violent', 'changes', 'pace', 'are', 'snippets', 'violent', 'flask', 'backs', 'and/or', 'premonitions-', 'actually', 'break', 'concentration', 'being', 'hooked', 'somehow', 'getting', 'off', 'line', 'only', '86', 'minutes', 'long', 'seem', 'whole', 'lot', 'longer', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'left', 'undecided', 'excellent', 'art', 'house', 'film', 'was', 'unable', 'get', 'slightly', 'disjointed', 'possibly', 'overly', 'self', 'indulgent', 'sort', 'triumph', 'style', 'substance', 'end', 'think', 'somewhere', 'two', 'hence', 'three', 'stars', 'Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'bad', 'film', 'shall', 'want', 'see', 'again', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'loved', 'great', 'am', 'pretty', 'sure', 'not', 'emotion', 'makers', 'were', 'aiming']",N/A
1369268,A2M9H45CBS0UH0,B003WH7AZ6,Tommy Jeffers,"[4, 6]","Valhalla Rising is one of those films that comes along rarely and disappears into obscurity before it truly gets noticed.  The movie is a brutal expression of beauty with existential questions.  One Eye is a tremendous character that is shown in all his base brutality, yet he has not lost his humanity.  He does what it takes to survive and protect those important to him.  The use of a small boy as a ""sidekick"" figure is a stroke of brilliance.  In a world of unmitigated cruelty, One Eye finds a place in his heart for a child.  Even though he doesn't utter a word, his emotional state is clear.  It is a mark of a truly gifted actor to be able to deliver such a vivid portrayal without speaking.  The plot of the film is ripe with legend and intrigue, and it is an overall satisfying romp.The strongest point of the film is its incredible camera work, and the striking visuals would make the movie worth seeing if the film had nothing else to offer.  The camera angels are employed by a true artist, and the surreal and disturbing scenes grab the viewer by the throat and send waves of discomfort to the soul.  It is not that the movie is overtly oppressive; it is simply capable of delivering a feeling of ""creepiness"" and otherworldly flavor better than most films I have seen.  The fact that One Eye sees things with his one eye that others do not nods to ancient beliefs and gives credit to its literary predecessors.The only negative aspect of the film, to me, is the chapters.  They seem to break the film up into acts in an unnecessary manner.  Honestly, the movie is so well crafted that the distinction of parts is unnecessary, and I found them somewhat distracting.  I understand the convention, but it feels as if the director is trying to hand hold the audience a bit.  Some of the imagery in certain segments will strike the viewer as odd and difficult to understand.  This film requires you to use your brain and have a basic to advanced understanding of symbolism to understand certain scenes.  In particular, the act entitled ""Hell,"" has some bizarre occurrences and requires some symbolic extrapolation to digest.  This segment portrays vice, filth, ritual, and madness with perfect clarity.  It is disturbing and disgusting in places.  Everything is dirty, gray and grimy.The power of Valhalla Rising rests in its ability to suck the viewer into the rich visuals and complex plot devices it gives out in wondrous measure.  It is not a happy movie.  It is not for the lame of brain.  It is a beautiful piece of violent art that slips quietly into the nether regions of the barbarian heart and finds morality and hope inside.  It is a picture of the depraved, the fanatical, the insane, and is a vision of one man willing to do what he needs to do to cross the gates of life into the pages of legend.",5,Quality Art,1304294400,"05 2, 2011",2011,2821,"['Valhalla', 'Rising', 'one', 'films', 'along', 'rarely', 'obscurity', 'truly', 'noticed', 'movie', 'brutal', 'expression', 'beauty', 'existential', 'questions', 'One', 'Eye', 'tremendous', 'character', 'shown', 'base', 'brutality', 'yet', 'not', 'lost', 'humanity', 'what', 'survive', 'protect', 'important', 'use', 'small', 'boy', 'sidekick', 'figure', 'stroke', 'brilliance', 'world', 'unmitigated', 'cruelty', 'One', 'Eye', 'place', 'heart', 'child', 'Even', ""n't"", 'utter', 'word', 'emotional', 'state', 'clear', 'mark', 'truly', 'gifted', 'actor', 'be', 'able', 'deliver', 'vivid', 'portrayal', 'speaking', 'plot', 'film', 'ripe', 'legend', 'intrigue', 'overall', 'satisfying', 'romp.The', 'strongest', 'point', 'film', 'incredible', 'camera', 'work', 'striking', 'visuals', 'would', 'make', 'movie', 'seeing', 'film', 'had', 'nothing', 'else', 'offer', 'camera', 'angels', 'are', 'employed', 'true', 'artist', 'surreal', 'disturbing', 'scenes', 'grab', 'viewer', 'throat', 'send', 'waves', 'discomfort', 'soul', 'not', 'movie', 'overtly', 'oppressive', 'simply', 'capable', 'delivering', 'feeling', 'creepiness', 'otherworldly', 'flavor', 'better', 'most', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'fact', 'One', 'Eye', 'things', 'one', 'eye', 'others', 'do', 'not', 'nods', 'ancient', 'beliefs', 'credit', 'literary', 'predecessors.The', 'only', 'negative', 'aspect', 'film', 'chapters', 'seem', 'break', 'film', 'up', 'acts', 'unnecessary', 'manner', 'Honestly', 'movie', 'so', 'well', 'crafted', 'distinction', 'parts', 'unnecessary', 'found', 'somewhat', 'distracting', 'understand', 'convention', 'director', 'trying', 'hand', 'hold', 'audience', 'bit', 'imagery', 'certain', 'segments', 'will', 'strike', 'viewer', 'odd', 'difficult', 'understand', 'film', 'use', 'brain', 'have', 'basic', 'advanced', 'understanding', 'symbolism', 'understand', 'certain', 'scenes', 'particular', 'act', 'entitled', 'Hell', 'bizarre', 'occurrences', 'symbolic', 'extrapolation', 'digest', 'segment', 'vice', 'filth', 'ritual', 'madness', 'perfect', 'clarity', 'disturbing', 'disgusting', 'places', 'Everything', 'dirty', 'gray', 'grimy.The', 'power', 'Valhalla', 'Rising', 'rests', 'ability', 'suck', 'viewer', 'rich', 'visuals', 'complex', 'plot', 'devices', 'out', 'wondrous', 'measure', 'not', 'happy', 'movie', 'not', 'lame', 'brain', 'beautiful', 'piece', 'violent', 'art', 'quietly', 'nether', 'regions', 'barbarian', 'heart', 'morality', 'hope', 'inside', 'picture', 'depraved', 'fanatical', 'insane', 'vision', 'one', 'man', 'willing', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'cross', 'gates', 'life', 'pages', 'legend']",N/A

On their way, something happens, they reach an unfamiliar place vibrant with beauty and dread. The film is, in the end, about salvation and redemption.With that description, the scenario doesn't quite stand out as breathtaking and the interest of the movie is elsewhere. As starters, picture quality is outstandingly beautiful and several shots come close to modern art painting. Acting is solid, great performance from Mads Mikkelsen in the solitary, brutal, mysterious stranger role. But more than anything else, it is the impeccable rendering of the thick atmosphere of individual isolation and mental degradation, the slow yet deep and inexorable drift of humans towards insanity and violent climax in the face of the unknown, the constant opposition between early Christian beliefs and ancestral, animalistic fears that make this movie a good experience.For those familiar with this other gem of the movie industry, ""Aguirre, the wrath of God"", Valhalla Rising conveys the same mix of madness, violence and unpredictability.

I don't think so.I was thoroughly engaged with the movie until the end. It was predictable as it had been given away. Imo, they landed somewhere around Newfoundland but the war clubs were not quite accurate nor was the depiction of the Natives who would've been Miqmac unless we're to assume they made it further south by the Abenaki, nor was the response proper and stone arrowheads penetrating chainmail was a mistake.One thing I never assumed was that One-Eye was a mute. A chosen silence makes more sense to me for the character. If he was a mute and I missed that his tongue was cut out, it still doesn't detract from the movie.A better ending would've been if he had fought with the natives with success and made us aware they were Abenaki and then turned back to them and turn himself over to them, been tied to a stake and tortured, enduring it in silence (reserved for only the most fierce enemies), and then burned alive which would also have given him a Viking funeral. Then a scene showing their respect and then the ending.I realize this would've been more gory and upset some who have certain ideas about Native Americans, but rest assured it would've been both accurate and far more dramatic. I seldom make a comment like this, but I believe it would've been a better movie. The way it was done left an emptiness from something left undone.That being said...worth owning? You bet!

The characters converse throughout the movie, except for the main character, who remains silent throuhout the entire movie. The script is not heavy nor complex and there are some periods of silence. However, the script and type of movie does not allow for understanding the background of everything that is happening nor the characters. You just kinda have to use your imagination. I don't feel this detracts from the movie much.The main character has no name but he is given a nickname, OneEye. The movies details part of his life. We are told little about him. He is mean, he can fight and he is ruthless. Apparently he is known and people consider him evil. He also has another side but that would be too much of a spoiler.There is a boy. His background is also not well explained. His association with OneEye is one of circumstance.There are three groups of men. Two unfriendly, one so-so friendly. The story seems to revovle around OneEye's experiences with these three groups.Honestly, I don't know how to explain this movie any better without it being a complete spoiler because this movie is very basic in its presentation of the story.This is a movie with a moderate amount of intense violence. When OneEye kills someone, it is often gory. So, if that type of stiff bothers you, this may not be the movie for you.Although I found things confusing and slow at times, I am glad I watched it til the end.
