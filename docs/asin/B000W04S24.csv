He does not tell stories, he insults and audiences have loved him for over 40 years. There are very few who can do what Rickles does and get away with it! His nickname Mr Warmth is known everywhere if you know comedyHowever he is also an actor with many TV and film appearances to his credit, everything fromX - The Man with the X-Ray Eyes,Beach Party/Bikini BeachtoToy Story & Toy Story 2 (2 Pack). This actor did everything from drama to comedy and made you believe.So the question is Who is the real Don Rickles?this  special film is part of discovering Rickles. The man, the comic , the actor and human being.  You see him, before he goes out into show and some of his stage act. Note this is not a concert film of his act, it shows highlights of his act. Other comedians from Richard Lewis to Chris Rock discuss in interviews what makes Rickles a comedian they admire.You see in film clips from the Tonight Show appearances  and Dean Martin roasts, you see  the classic insult comic at his best in a medium that showcases his talents. My favorite piece is the Tonight Show's Johnny Carson miffed at Rickles breaking his cigarette box on the previous Tonight Show where he guest hosted, going over Rickles's show which was taping next door  and reaming the insult comic out.Also You see Rickles the actor with interviews from Filmmaker Roger Corman and others. You see interviews and clips showing how he and Ernest Borgnine & Rickles did the Odd Couple on stage to how the comic became the  voice of Mr. Potato HeadAfter all is said and done, you have a little more depth of Rickles the man and performer. It is good this was done now. He seems old and frail for 82. This film showcases a major bit player and a major comic legend.

He had a quick wit that surpassed those around him and when he went off into his wild mental/verbal assualts he was in a zone all his own. No one could lovingly cut people to shreds like Rickles. He seemed hateful and yet funny at the same time but there was always something special that came through from him that made you love him. He forced you to laugh at your own self no matter what background you came from and taught us all that humor and laughter is universal and the truth may hurt but laughter doeth good like a medicine. His gift was unique and only Robin Williams can hang with him when it comes to the art of fast verbal and mental connection and still be outrageous. This DVD captures some of that gift that he had but i would loved to have seen more of his Vegas show act and more clips of the classic Rickles on different talk shows of yesteryear but overall worth buying. NO one can do this kind of comedy like Rickles.

To see this gent perform, especially back in the day, is to see something visceral and almost dangerous. It's really hard to do what Don Rickles does so well, has been doing so well for so many decades. Don Rickles is a fearless insult comic and he's got such a way about him that celebrities - let alone the audiences - flock to his gigs just to get a chance to be made fun of by him, because you haven't made it until Mr. Warmth has tossed some venom your way. And he does it to everyone, doesn't matter the color or gender or religious faith or political leanings or whatever. You show up, and he'll bag on you just for being a miserable human being. As someone appropriately comments in this thing: ""Don has never lost his disdain for sensitivity.""In his Vegas act he wades into the audience like an old pugilist and barks at an old woman, ""I spoke to the Home, you're going back."" He ejects a man off his seat and then hits on the guy's woman companion. He looks at an Asian guy and tells him, ""Three years in the jungle looking for your father."" And they all laugh and don't feel stung. Don Rickles gets his just due in MR. WARMTH: THE DON RICKLES PROJECT, and maybe in this documentary we can figure out why Rickles elicits such generous laughter. This HBO homage, directed by John Landis, explores Rickles's backstory, including how he came up sharing time with stripper acts and how he broke thru at the Slate Brothers Club and how he stayed on top. We get a peek at his several flirtations with cinema, and I'm still waiting for a DVD release of CPO SHARKEY.Archival footage provides classic clips of his guest spots on the Johnny Carson show (including when he broke Johnny's cherished cigarette box), and Johnny would never ever prepare anything; he'd just go with whatever Rickles came up with. Also here is one very memorable moment in which he made fun of Ronald Reagan in his 1985 presidential inauguration gala. But, perhaps, nothing showcases Rickles' brilliance as much as his spectacular stints on the Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts. In these roasts he raked Hollywood luminaries over the coals - mega-stars like Sinatra, Dean Martin, Hope, etc. - and the crazy thing was that they all loved it.Heck, there's even an interesting aside as celebrities reflect on how effective the Mob actually was in running Las Vegas, before the corporate mentality swooped in. All the ""This Is Your Life"" stuff is intercut with segments from a live performance Rickles did in (I think) Vegas' Golden Nugget Hotel & Casino on March 23, 2007. Old as he is, shaky nowadays and not as sure footed under the bright lights, Mr. Warmth, the Merchant of Venom, still demonstrates that he has lost neither wit nor edge.The man is revered by some of today's most outspoken and controversial comedians (Chris Rock, Sarah Silverman, Penn Jillette, Dave Attell, Bob Newhart... okay Newhart's not that controversial or that current), and most of them marvel at how funny Rickles is and, yeah, how he gets away with his material. Along the way, the show flirts with dissecting the nature of humor, but only a bit. People do try to break down just what it is about Rickles, with his vicious act, that make people give him a pass. I do agree that the key to Don Rickles' success and longevity is that he doesn't ever discriminate. He picks on everyone, and nothing but nothing is sacred. And there's probably something cathartic about his routine, a release. But even more than that, it's one of the worst-kept secrets in the entertainment biz that Don Rickles is genuinely a nice guy, a soft touch. You won't see it much here, but he usually ends his vicious rants with some genuine sentiment, because sweets at the end make the beatings go down easier.

1105874,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B000W04S24,trebe,"[0, 0]","Mr. Warmth: The Don Rickles Project (2007) is a documentary by director John Landis (Animal House), about the entertainment legend, whose career has spanned over five decades.  The comedian's nickname ""Mr. Warmth"", is an ironic reference to his abrasive put down style of comedy.  While some may find him offensive, most realize that Rickles isn't a bigot, or preacher of hate, and that his unique shtick, had its genesis in a different time, when racial relations, and tolerance and acceptance for certain ideas, are not as enlightened as they are now.In the last fifty years, the world has undergone wide sweeping changes, that are so immense, and easy to take for granted.  For those of a certain age, Don Rickles provides a window to the past.  How we may see the past will vary, but in remembering how things were, we can reflect on where we have come from, and hopefully enjoy a laugh.  Many things in life however, have not changed, and Rickles remains relevant today, although his appeal may mostly be to those over forty.For director John Landis, this is a very personal project.  As a young man breaking into the business, Landis, worked on the production staff of the film Kelly Heroes (1969), which was shot on location in Yugoslavia.  The WW II adventure starred Clint Eastwood, Telly Savalas, Donald Sutherland, and one Don Rickles.  Rickles' acting career is unrated, and largely forgotten or unknown to many, but as is pointed out in the documentary, he was quite active in the 1960's as a guest star, and as a regular on the Dean Martin Celebrity Roast, where he absolutely killed.Landis's 90 minute documentary features interviews with old friends and contemporaries, members of Rickles staff, younger comedians he has inspired, and other various admirers.  Among those featured are Bob Newhart, Debbie Reynolds, Clint Eastwood, Robert DeNiro, Jack Carter, Steve Lawrence, Penn Jillette, Martin Scorsese, Sara Silverman, Robin Williams, Jimmy Kimmel, and Joan Rivers.  Unfortunately, so many of Don's contemporaries are no longer with us.  In addition to these testimonials and remembrances, there is plenty from Rickles himself, including clips from his many appearances on The Tonight Show, and other talk shows.There are also segments of Rickles performing stand up live at the Stardust and various other venues.  Rickles never engages in profanity, but unleashed live, like a playful attack dog, he will pick on various members of the audience, usually based on their ethnic background or physical appearance.  Few are safe from his barbs, as he works various religious, racial, and cultural stereotypes, into his act.  Rickles no doubt offends some people, but he has done a variation of the same act so long, that he kind of gets a pass, because people know what to expect.  As something of a relic from the past, delivering an older style of humor, Rickles is still hilarious.  Even in his 80's, the man's mind is sharp, and his insults can cut like a dagger.Mr. Warmth, is more of a testimonial to the man, rather than a biography.  You get an idea of his personality, and affect on others in the industry, rather than a recounting of what he has done through the years.  The gruff exterior and mean spiritedness, is an act, as Rickles is actually a humble man, who works his butt off as a performer.  As many of those that knew Rickles very well, like Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., and Johnny Carson, are no longer with us, the emphasis is generally on the second half of his career, which makes the film slightly more relevant to a younger audience.The DVD contains two discs.  The first contains the main feature, and the second has short clips of interviews with various personalities, who may or may not be discussing Rickles.  There are some interesting conversations, but most of the content on Disc 2 is extraneous, and could have been included on the first disc.The legendary Mr. Warmth is still performing, although his live appearances are limited, and generally geared toward resort areas.  If Don Rickles is coming to your area, you may want to take the opportunity to see this comic legend, as who knows when you may have another chance to see him again.  It would also be very cool, if the series CPO Sharkey (1976-78), were released on DVD.",4,feel the heat . . .,1275955200,"06 8, 2010",2010,4297,"['Mr', 'Warmth', 'Don', 'Rickles', 'Project', '2007', 'documentary', 'director', 'John', 'Landis', 'Animal', 'House', 'entertainment', 'legend', 'career', 'spanned', 'over', 'five', 'decades', 'comedian', 'nickname', 'Mr', 'Warmth', 'ironic', 'reference', 'abrasive', 'put', 'down', 'style', 'comedy', 'may', 'find', 'offensive', 'most', 'realize', 'Rickles', ""n't"", 'bigot', 'preacher', 'hate', 'unique', 'shtick', 'had', 'genesis', 'different', 'time', 'when', 'racial', 'relations', 'tolerance', 'acceptance', 'certain', 'ideas', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'enlightened', 'are', 'last', 'fifty', 'years', 'world', 'undergone', 'wide', 'sweeping', 'changes', 'are', 'so', 'immense', 'easy', 'take', 'granted', 'certain', 'age', 'Don', 'Rickles', 'window', 'past', 'How', 'may', 'see', 'past', 'will', 'vary', 'remembering', 'how', 'things', 'were', 'can', 'reflect', 'where', 'have', 'come', 'hopefully', 'enjoy', 'laugh', 'Many', 'things', 'life', 'however', 'have', 'not', 'changed', 'Rickles', 'relevant', 'today', 'appeal', 'may', 'mostly', 'be', 'forty.For', 'director', 'John', 'Landis', 'very', 'personal', 'project', 'young', 'man', 'breaking', 'business', 'Landis', 'worked', 'production', 'staff', 'film', 'Kelly', 'Heroes', '1969', 'was', 'shot', 'location', 'Yugoslavia', 'WW', 'II', 'adventure', 'starred', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Telly', 'Savalas', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'one', 'Don', 'Rickles', 'Rickles', 'acting', 'career', 'unrated', 'largely', 'forgotten', 'unknown', 'many', 'pointed', 'out', 'documentary', 'was', 'quite', 'active', '1960', 'guest', 'star', 'regular', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'Celebrity', 'Roast', 'where', 'absolutely', 'killed.Landis', '90', 'minute', 'documentary', 'features', 'interviews', 'old', 'friends', 'contemporaries', 'members', 'Rickles', 'staff', 'younger', 'comedians', 'inspired', 'other', 'various', 'admirers', 'featured', 'are', 'Bob', 'Newhart', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'Jack', 'Carter', 'Steve', 'Lawrence', 'Penn', 'Jillette', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'Sara', 'Silverman', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Jimmy', 'Kimmel', 'Joan', 'Rivers', 'Unfortunately', 'so', 'many', 'Don', 'contemporaries', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'addition', 'testimonials', 'remembrances', 'plenty', 'Rickles', 'including', 'clips', 'many', 'appearances', 'Tonight', 'Show', 'other', 'talk', 'are', 'also', 'segments', 'Rickles', 'performing', 'stand', 'up', 'live', 'Stardust', 'various', 'other', 'venues', 'Rickles', 'never', 'profanity', 'unleashed', 'live', 'playful', 'attack', 'dog', 'will', 'pick', 'various', 'members', 'audience', 'usually', 'based', 'ethnic', 'background', 'physical', 'appearance', 'Few', 'are', 'safe', 'barbs', 'various', 'religious', 'racial', 'cultural', 'stereotypes', 'act', 'doubt', 'people', 'done', 'variation', 'same', 'act', 'so', 'long', 'kind', 'pass', 'people', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'something', 'relic', 'past', 'delivering', 'older', 'style', 'humor', 'Rickles', 'still', 'hilarious', 'Even', '80', 'man', 'mind', 'sharp', 'insults', 'can', 'cut', 'dagger.Mr', 'Warmth', 'more', 'testimonial', 'man', 'rather', 'biography', 'get', 'idea', 'personality', 'affect', 'others', 'industry', 'rather', 'recounting', 'what', 'done', 'years', 'gruff', 'exterior', 'mean', 'spiritedness', 'act', 'Rickles', 'actually', 'humble', 'man', 'who', 'butt', 'off', 'performer', 'many', 'knew', 'Rickles', 'very', 'well', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'Sammy', 'Davis', 'Jr.', 'Johnny', 'Carson', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'emphasis', 'generally', 'second', 'half', 'career', 'film', 'slightly', 'more', 'relevant', 'younger', 'audience.The', 'DVD', 'two', 'discs', 'first', 'main', 'feature', 'second', 'short', 'clips', 'interviews', 'various', 'personalities', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'discussing', 'Rickles', 'are', 'interesting', 'conversations', 'most', 'content', 'Disc', '2', 'extraneous', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'first', 'disc.The', 'legendary', 'Mr', 'Warmth', 'still', 'performing', 'live', 'appearances', 'are', 'limited', 'generally', 'geared', 'resort', 'areas', 'Don', 'Rickles', 'coming', 'area', 'may', 'want', 'take', 'opportunity', 'see', 'comic', 'legend', 'who', 'when', 'may', 'have', 'chance', 'see', 'again', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'very', 'cool', 'series', 'CPO', 'Sharkey', '1976-78', 'were', 'released', 'DVD']",Mr. Warmth: The Don Rickles Project
