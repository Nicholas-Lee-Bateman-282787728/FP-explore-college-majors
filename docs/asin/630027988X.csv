He has captured the flawed character of Clarence Earl Gideon like no other actor.This seemingly inconsequential individual who changed the course of American jurisprudence through his appeal to the US Supreme Court for legal representation is portrayed by Fonda so convincingly and so assuredly that Fonda and Gideon become indivisible.One is equally astonished that the High Court gave such consideration to a relatively minor infraction of the law, and in doing so, gave everyone like the obscure,impoverished Gideon the right to council regardless of their station in life.As has been stated elsewhere, this film is both an entertaining and informative experience.

240948,A18RBRV5S99XD8,630027988X,GRAHAM TOMLINSON,"[10, 10]","Henry Fonda at seventy four, but he glues together what you may not guess is a T.V. movie with the acting skills of a consumate professional. He plays an ageing semi-literate who just happens to be in the wrong place  when a shop break-in and robbery occurs. The actual culprit names Fonda,  who with a track record of petty crime is found guilty himself. He had  fallen to the mercy of a ruling, made twenty years earlier, that those  accused of &quot;non serious&quot; crime did not require the representation  of a lawyer, and he was ofcourse in no financial position to hire one.  Based on a true story, it tells, in a slow-paced but nonetheless  fascinating fashion, how Clarence Earl Gideon(Fonda) studies the law books  in his prison library over a two year period , culminating in a letter of  appeal to the High Court being taken on by a high-profile lawyer (Jose  Ferrer in a strong performance) who succeeds in overturning this ruling,  and subsequently in a re-trial Gideon is found innocent. Henry Fonda is  quiet, reserved, and as amazingly natural and superb as ever. Its also nice  to see Fay Wray in a small role as his landlady.

240951,A1L43KWWR05PCS,630027988X,Lawyeraau,"[49, 50]","This is a movie made great by Henry Fonda's compelling portrayal of an unlikely folk hero,Clarence Earl Gideon,  who was the catalyst for one of the most significant changes in our legal system. The seminal case of Gideon v. Wainright ultimately saw the United States Supreme Court establish that anyone who is charged with a crime is entitled to legal representation by an attorney.Clarence Earl Gideon was no angel. He was a four time loser, who had been arrested for the burglary of a pool room. He did, however, maintain that he was innocent in this instance and demanded a trial, as he had no intention of pleading guilty for a crime that he did not commit. When Gideon, a semi illiterate, poorly educated man, requested an attorney to represent him at the trial, his request was denied, the presiding judge being of the mind that Gideon was able to represent himself. Gideon did not have a clue and, consequently, was convicted and sentenced to a five year prison term.Gideon wrote an appeal to the United States Supreme Court, which granted his appeal, and its justices set a new precedent with their ruling. His case was remanded to the Florida state court for a retrial. He was appointed an attorney, tried and, ultimately, acquitted of all charges, deservedly so, based upon the evidentiary weakness of the case against him. Justice delayed, however, is, as always, justice denied, as Gideon ended up serving two years in prison for a crime that he did not commit, before he was finally freed.This is a terrific film with wonderful performances by the entire cast. Henry Fonda is superlative as the stalwart Gideon, whose innate sense of fair play and faith in the United States Constitution helped shape the legal system that we know today. This is a film well worth watching.",5,FOR LEGAL BEAGLES EVERYWHERE...,998524800,"08 23, 2001",2001,1787,"['movie', 'made', 'great', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'compelling', 'portrayal', 'unlikely', 'folk', 'hero', 'Clarence', 'Earl', 'Gideon', 'who', 'was', 'catalyst', 'one', 'most', 'significant', 'changes', 'legal', 'system', 'seminal', 'case', 'Gideon', 'v.', 'Wainright', 'ultimately', 'saw', 'United', 'States', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'establish', 'anyone', 'who', 'charged', 'crime', 'entitled', 'legal', 'representation', 'attorney.Clarence', 'Earl', 'Gideon', 'was', 'angel', 'was', 'four', 'time', 'loser', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'arrested', 'burglary', 'pool', 'room', 'did', 'however', 'maintain', 'was', 'innocent', 'instance', 'demanded', 'trial', 'had', 'intention', 'pleading', 'guilty', 'crime', 'did', 'not', 'commit', 'When', 'Gideon', 'semi', 'illiterate', 'poorly', 'educated', 'man', 'requested', 'attorney', 'represent', 'trial', 'request', 'was', 'denied', 'presiding', 'judge', 'being', 'mind', 'Gideon', 'was', 'able', 'represent', 'Gideon', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'clue', 'consequently', 'was', 'convicted', 'sentenced', 'five', 'year', 'prison', 'term.Gideon', 'wrote', 'appeal', 'United', 'States', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'granted', 'appeal', 'justices', 'set', 'new', 'precedent', 'ruling', 'case', 'was', 'remanded', 'Florida', 'state', 'court', 'retrial', 'was', 'appointed', 'attorney', 'tried', 'ultimately', 'acquitted', 'charges', 'deservedly', 'so', 'based', 'evidentiary', 'weakness', 'case', 'Justice', 'delayed', 'however', 'always', 'justice', 'denied', 'Gideon', 'ended', 'up', 'serving', 'two', 'years', 'prison', 'crime', 'did', 'not', 'commit', 'was', 'finally', 'freed.This', 'terrific', 'film', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'superlative', 'stalwart', 'Gideon', 'innate', 'sense', 'fair', 'play', 'faith', 'United', 'States', 'Constitution', 'helped', 'shape', 'legal', 'system', 'know', 'today', 'film', 'well', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A
