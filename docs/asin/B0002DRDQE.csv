831371,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B0002DRDQE,Alex Udvary,"[3, 4]","I suppose ""Godsend"" could have been a really great film had it been a human drama. The topic, cloning, is a controversial subject, and thus if someone talented was writing this film, or at least someone with an idea in their head, the movie could have made a social commentary. But, instead of talking about what kind of movie ""Godsend"" could have been I'm going to take Roger Ebert's advice and talk about what ""Godsend"" is actually about.""Godsend"" is about Paul and Jessie Duncan (Greg Kinnear and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) who must come to terms with the death of their 8 year old son Adam (Cameron Bright). Soon after the boys death a doctor, Richard Wells (Robert De Niro) tells the parents he has invented a way to clone a human being. Paul and Jessie soon get into an agrument over the subject. Jessie wants the doctor to clone their son Paul doesn't. This scene offers the worst dialogue exchange I've heard in a while. Paul tells his wife ""I can't believe you're considering this."" To which she yells back ""I can't believe you're not!"" Now how are you going to argue that? Of course the couple then decide to go ahead with the idea.""Godsend"" is a film with a lot of faults. There is no human element added to the story. We never feel we know Paul and Jessie or for that matter Adam. We never feel their grief. The movie takes place over a 16 year period and never once does age show on any characters face. They look the same from the begining of the movie till the end. And I thought the movie's conclusion is sort of sprung on us, not fully played out. But despite all of these short comings I liked this movie. Why? I just found it suspenseful. Notice I didn't say scary. I don't think of this movie as a horror film. I think of it more so as a thriller. I thought the performances by Kinnear and Stamos were effective. I was drawn into the story.A lot of you might think I'm crazy. I've read only a few of the comments here on Amazon. They all more or less say the same thing. Even I have touched upon some of the movie's weak points. Everyone thinks the movie just doesn't gel together but I thought the script by Mark Bomback if anything was able to involve me enough into the story where I wanted to see how the movie ends. And that is all I can ask for. People must have walked into the movie with high expectations, maybe that's why I wasn't disappointed. I was expecting junk. I don't think people are giving this movie a fair chance. People are expecting more from the movie than I think it originally intended.I talked about Kinnear and Stamos giving, at times, effective performances but I want to say a word about Robert De Niro. There was a time De Niro acted in great films; ""Taxi Driver"", ""The Godfather pt. 2"" , ""Raging Bull"", ""Mean Streets"" and then something happened and De Niro started acting in lighter fare. Somehow he's become a comedic actor; ""Meet the Parents"", ""Showtime"", ""Anaylze This"" and its sequel. What happened? Does De Niro feel he has nothing to prove anymore? Now he wants to take it easy and live off his past films? Or has Hollywood simply run out of good ideas? Or has the public grown tired of actors like De Niro, Pacino, and Nicholson? Have we become too comic book crazy? Is there no longer a place for these actors is it all about who looks good in a cape? This is something people should start thinking about before they bash De Niro's recent roles.So is ""Godsend"" a great movie? No. But I do think it is an example of mindless fun Hollywood entertainment. I think the movie can carry your interest and at least it doesn't try to seem important.Bottomline: Worthwhile movie that has effective performaces by Kinear and Stamos and an offbeat one by De Niro. Despite the movie's flaws, and there are plenty, I strangely found myself entertained.",3,"This Movie Is Not A ""Godsend""",1117324800,"05 29, 2005",2005,3796,"['suppose', 'Godsend', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'great', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'human', 'drama', 'topic', 'cloning', 'controversial', 'subject', 'thus', 'someone', 'talented', 'was', 'writing', 'film', 'least', 'someone', 'idea', 'head', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'social', 'commentary', 'instead', 'talking', 'what', 'kind', 'movie', 'Godsend', 'could', 'have', 'been', ""'m"", 'going', 'take', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'advice', 'talk', 'what', 'Godsend', 'actually', 'about', 'Godsend', 'Paul', 'Jessie', 'Duncan', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'Rebecca', 'Romijn-Stamos', 'who', 'must', 'come', 'terms', 'death', '8', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'Adam', 'Cameron', 'Bright', 'Soon', 'boys', 'death', 'doctor', 'Richard', 'Wells', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'parents', 'invented', 'way', 'clone', 'human', 'being', 'Paul', 'Jessie', 'soon', 'get', 'agrument', 'subject', 'Jessie', 'doctor', 'clone', 'son', 'Paul', ""n't"", 'scene', 'worst', 'dialogue', 'exchange', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'while', 'Paul', 'wife', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', ""'re"", 'considering', 'back', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', ""'re"", 'not', 'Now', 'how', 'are', 'going', 'argue', 'course', 'couple', 'then', 'decide', 'go', 'ahead', 'idea', 'Godsend', 'film', 'lot', 'faults', 'human', 'element', 'added', 'story', 'never', 'feel', 'know', 'Paul', 'Jessie', 'matter', 'Adam', 'never', 'feel', 'grief', 'movie', 'place', '16', 'year', 'period', 'never', 'once', 'age', 'show', 'characters', 'face', 'look', 'same', 'begining', 'movie', 'end', 'thought', 'movie', 'conclusion', 'sort', 'sprung', 'not', 'fully', 'played', 'out', 'short', 'comings', 'liked', 'movie', 'Why', 'just', 'found', 'suspenseful', 'Notice', 'did', ""n't"", 'say', 'scary', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'horror', 'film', 'think', 'more', 'so', 'thriller', 'thought', 'performances', 'Kinnear', 'Stamos', 'were', 'effective', 'was', 'drawn', 'story.A', 'lot', 'might', 'think', ""'m"", 'crazy', ""'ve"", 'read', 'only', 'few', 'comments', 'here', 'Amazon', 'more', 'less', 'say', 'same', 'thing', 'Even', 'have', 'touched', 'movie', 'weak', 'points', 'Everyone', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'gel', 'together', 'thought', 'script', 'Mark', 'Bomback', 'anything', 'was', 'able', 'involve', 'enough', 'story', 'where', 'wanted', 'see', 'how', 'movie', 'can', 'ask', 'People', 'must', 'have', 'walked', 'movie', 'high', 'expectations', 'maybe', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'was', 'expecting', 'junk', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'people', 'are', 'giving', 'movie', 'fair', 'chance', 'People', 'are', 'expecting', 'more', 'movie', 'think', 'originally', 'talked', 'Kinnear', 'Stamos', 'giving', 'times', 'effective', 'performances', 'want', 'say', 'word', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'was', 'time', 'De', 'Niro', 'acted', 'great', 'films', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'Godfather', 'pt', '2', 'Raging', 'Bull', 'Mean', 'Streets', 'then', 'something', 'happened', 'De', 'Niro', 'started', 'acting', 'lighter', 'fare', 'Somehow', 'become', 'comedic', 'actor', 'Meet', 'Parents', 'Showtime', 'Anaylze', 'sequel', 'What', 'happened', 'Does', 'De', 'Niro', 'feel', 'nothing', 'prove', 'anymore', 'Now', 'take', 'easy', 'live', 'past', 'films', 'Or', 'Hollywood', 'simply', 'run', 'good', 'ideas', 'public', 'grown', 'tired', 'actors', 'De', 'Niro', 'Pacino', 'Nicholson', 'Have', 'become', 'too', 'comic', 'book', 'crazy', 'there', 'no', 'longer', 'place', 'actors', 'who', 'good', 'cape', 'something', 'people', 'should', 'start', 'thinking', 'bash', 'De', 'Niro', 'recent', 'roles.So', 'Godsend', 'great', 'movie', 'No', 'do', 'think', 'example', 'mindless', 'fun', 'Hollywood', 'entertainment', 'think', 'movie', 'can', 'carry', 'interest', 'least', ""n't"", 'try', 'seem', 'important.Bottomline', 'Worthwhile', 'movie', 'effective', 'performaces', 'Kinear', 'Stamos', 'offbeat', 'one', 'De', 'Niro', 'movie', 'flaws', 'are', 'plenty', 'strangely', 'found', 'entertained']",Godsend
831372,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0002DRDQE,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","Okay, so I have many a bone to pick with this movie.  First of all, the theatrical trailer made one believe they were in for a very scary good time.  This is false advertisement in my opinion.  The movie is not scary.  Second of all, it sports a cast that includes quite frankly the best actor to ever walk this Earth, at least he was when he was in his prime, and so to have Robert DeNiro dumb himself down so much for a role is just irritating to me.  Third, it opens with promise and even ends with promise but somewhere in the middle it loses all sense of surroundings and just goes stupid on us.  The plot is one that with a little tweaking could have been stellar.  I say stellar and I mean that in total B-movie horror takes of the word.  This could have become a grade-A B-movie if that makes any sense, but instead it became a C-grade C-movie and that's a shame, a real shame.The film revolves around the Duncan family, Paul, Jessie and their son Adam.  You can tell right off the bat that this family is very close-knit.  They love each other more than anything else and would do anything for each other.  Especially evident is the love between Jessie and Adam.Something tragic must happen though and this comes in the form of a hit-and-run.  While out shopping with his mother for tennis shoes young Adam wonders outside to bounce his basketball (the one his father bought him for his birthday) when he's struck by an oncoming car and killed.  The Duncan family falls apart after his death and they begin to digress within themselves until they meet Doctor Richard Wells who offers to give them their son back through cloning.  This is of course absurd, and quite frankly illegal.  The Duncan's would have to move away from their family and friends and cut off all ties if they were to concede with the procedure.  After giving it careful thought and consideration (sure) they decide to go ahead with the cloning and nine months later Jessie gives birth to her son all over again.  Life is good until Adam turns eight (the age in which he originally died) and then things take a turn for the worse.  His behavior changes and he begins to suffer from night terrors that may or may not have significance.This conclusion is one that, albeit a bit on the predictable side, actually does the film some good.  We wonder throughout the film just what Richard's hidden agenda could be (because you just know he has one) and when it's revealed it's not as horrid as it could have been.  What is horrid though is the acting here, especially on the part of Romijn and Kinnear.  I'm a fan of Kinnear's but films like this do nothing for him.  DeNiro just can't seem to catch a break lately.  He's one of our finest actors ever to work a day in this business but he keeps selecting the worst possible films for himself.  This could be the worst.  The one shining light here though is Cameron Bright, who plays Adam.  He is one creepy kid, and he's used that to his advantage in his film choices (watch him in `Butterfly Effect' or in `Birth' to get a better understanding).  Here he's a little wasted since he really isn't given the opportunity to really scare us, at least not for a lasting period of time.That brings me to my biggest reservation with this film.  It's really not scary, at all.  With the material they had the opportunity to real nail this and make it just horrifically unsettling, but instead they took a very tame approach (maybe in an effort to get the PG-13 rating) and in my opinion ruined what they had going.  When you see that of the five endings shot for this film they chose the tamest one you realize that they just didn't know what they were doing.  I can easily think of a few ways they could have saved this film from mediocrity, in the final few frames alone (come on, boy in a shed, hatchet in his hand, mother in front of him...does anyone really have to survive in this film?) but alas, everything has to have a happy ending these days, well, sort of.So, `Godsend' could have been a much better film but quite frankly it's not, which is sad, because I really wanted it to be.",2,A maybe too tame approach to what could have been nightmarish (in a good way)...,1190678400,"09 25, 2007",2007,4109,"['Okay', 'so', 'have', 'many', 'bone', 'pick', 'movie', 'First', 'all', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'made', 'one', 'believe', 'were', 'very', 'scary', 'good', 'time', 'false', 'advertisement', 'opinion', 'movie', 'not', 'scary', 'Second', 'sports', 'cast', 'quite', 'frankly', 'best', 'actor', 'ever', 'walk', 'Earth', 'least', 'was', 'when', 'was', 'prime', 'so', 'have', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'down', 'so', 'much', 'role', 'just', 'irritating', 'Third', 'promise', 'even', 'promise', 'somewhere', 'middle', 'sense', 'surroundings', 'just', 'stupid', 'plot', 'one', 'little', 'tweaking', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'stellar', 'say', 'stellar', 'mean', 'total', 'B-movie', 'horror', 'word', 'could', 'have', 'become', 'grade-A', 'B-movie', 'sense', 'instead', 'became', 'C-grade', 'C-movie', 'shame', 'real', 'shame.The', 'film', 'Duncan', 'family', 'Paul', 'Jessie', 'son', 'Adam', 'can', 'tell', 'right', 'bat', 'family', 'very', 'close-knit', 'love', 'other', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'would', 'do', 'anything', 'other', 'Especially', 'evident', 'love', 'Jessie', 'Adam.Something', 'tragic', 'must', 'happen', 'form', 'hit-and-run', 'out', 'shopping', 'mother', 'tennis', 'shoes', 'young', 'Adam', 'wonders', 'bounce', 'basketball', 'one', 'father', 'bought', 'birthday', 'when', 'struck', 'oncoming', 'car', 'killed', 'Duncan', 'family', 'apart', 'death', 'begin', 'digress', 'meet', 'Doctor', 'Richard', 'Wells', 'who', 'give', 'son', 'back', 'cloning', 'course', 'absurd', 'quite', 'frankly', 'illegal', 'Duncan', 'would', 'have', 'move', 'away', 'family', 'friends', 'cut', 'off', 'ties', 'were', 'concede', 'procedure', 'giving', 'careful', 'thought', 'consideration', 'sure', 'decide', 'go', 'ahead', 'cloning', 'nine', 'months', 'later', 'Jessie', 'birth', 'son', 'over', 'again', 'Life', 'good', 'Adam', 'turns', 'eight', 'age', 'originally', 'died', 'then', 'things', 'take', 'turn', 'worse', 'behavior', 'changes', 'suffer', 'night', 'terrors', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'significance.This', 'conclusion', 'one', 'albeit', 'bit', 'predictable', 'side', 'actually', 'film', 'good', 'wonder', 'film', 'just', 'what', 'Richard', 'hidden', 'agenda', 'could', 'be', 'just', 'know', 'one', 'when', 'revealed', 'not', 'as', 'horrid', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'What', 'horrid', 'acting', 'here', 'especially', 'part', 'Romijn', 'Kinnear', ""'m"", 'fan', 'Kinnear', 'films', 'do', 'nothing', 'DeNiro', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'catch', 'break', 'lately', 'one', 'finest', 'actors', 'ever', 'work', 'day', 'business', 'selecting', 'worst', 'possible', 'films', 'could', 'be', 'worst', 'one', 'shining', 'light', 'here', 'Cameron', 'Bright', 'who', 'Adam', 'one', 'creepy', 'kid', 'used', 'advantage', 'film', 'choices', 'watch', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', 'Birth', 'get', 'better', 'understanding', 'Here', 'little', 'wasted', 'really', ""n't"", 'given', 'opportunity', 'really', 'scare', 'least', 'not', 'lasting', 'period', 'biggest', 'reservation', 'film', 'really', 'not', 'scary', 'material', 'had', 'opportunity', 'real', 'nail', 'make', 'just', 'horrifically', 'unsettling', 'instead', 'took', 'very', 'tame', 'approach', 'maybe', 'effort', 'get', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'opinion', 'ruined', 'what', 'had', 'going', 'When', 'see', 'five', 'endings', 'shot', 'film', 'chose', 'tamest', 'one', 'realize', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'can', 'easily', 'think', 'few', 'ways', 'could', 'have', 'saved', 'film', 'mediocrity', 'final', 'few', 'frames', 'alone', 'come', 'boy', 'shed', 'hatchet', 'hand', 'mother', 'front', 'anyone', 'really', 'have', 'survive', 'film', 'alas', 'everything', 'have', 'happy', 'ending', 'days', 'well', 'sort', 'of.So', 'Godsend', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'quite', 'frankly', 'not', 'sad', 'really', 'wanted', 'be']",Godsend

831374,A307FCQ96L9LAF,B0002DRDQE,"Avery ""Cantankerous""","[1, 1]","Beware of the film that you try to watch more than once only to stop it time after time because it's just not ""doing it"" for you.On about the fourth go-around of this little ""I want to watch a movie, oh, wait, this movie is crap, nevermind"" game, I decided that I was actually going to sit down and really watch this flick all the way through. Hey, interesting premise, right? Some kid dies, his doting parents bring him back to life through the infant science of cloning, and he starts to get visions of the afterlife once he passes the age at which he died. Not bad. That can be worked with to wonderful results, right? Well, no. You'd THINK that, but you'd be wrong. This movie leaves a LOT to be desired.Why this? Why would De Niro and Romijn-Stamos and Kinnear--all three of them capable of much more than this trainwreck--agree to perform in such a by-the-numbers thriller with no ending? Their talent is wasted on a horrible, implausible script that in no way mimics the pathos of actual human beings. Why would parents who love and respect their child as much as these people appear to do agree to such a selfish experiment? It doesn't fit. Their decision to clone their dead son comes shockingly easy, while I'd be able to safely say that 99% of people in the same situation would at least wait a few months before saying ""this is creepy and weird; no thanks"".Add to this the confusing but ultimately boring subplot of De Niro's dead son being somehow mixed into the clone of the dead kid's personality to create a split persona and you've got... well, nothing, really. Nothing at all. Just a muddled mess puked out onto your TV screen.This movie has no idea what it wants to be. If it was trying to be a poignant argument against cloning, I'm seriously considering reanimating the next dead animal that I see on the side of the road just to spite anyone involved in the making of this film.

831377,A20IIR0422G3A5,B0002DRDQE,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[1, 2]","`Godsend' is a minor league effort borrowing a few of superstar actor Robert DeNiro's talents to give some cachet of quality to this moderately scary but intellectually unsatisfying thriller / horror movie. All one has to do is to compare this movie to greats in the genre with children as central characters such as the original `The Exorcist' and `The Shining' to see how short this movie falls from those successful scarefests.I believe the problem is that the concept begins with a really interesting, but somewhat half-baked idea about creating an exact copy of a child killed in an accident through cloning, since the mother cannot conceive, but she can carry a fetus to a successful birth in her womb, and, of course, she doesn't want another child, she wants her own lost `Adam'. Aside from the fact that the story sticks with current political atmosphere and holds that this procedure is illegal, there is not much in the concept so far to make it thrilling or horrific. At least, the writer, director, and producer were not willing to turn this into something interesting without additional tinkering with the concept. So, they added the new twist of a hidden agenda carried out by the doctor / scientist of `Godsend' corporation, our own Bobbie DeNiro, who solicits the parents to do the cloning.As the story revolves around the development of the cloned 8-year-old son, the weakness in the child actor for this character is one of the most evident lapses in the movie. Like the little boy in `The Shining', Adam has what seems to be an imaginary friend, cleverly named Zachary (note the juxtaposition of first letters of their names). Yet this device is very weakly implemented. Just watch the scenes in `The Shining' where `Captain Howdy' appears and the difference in dramatic impact is palpable. The child actor, Cameron Bright will probably not win any appearances on the Ellen DeGeneres show for this performance.The dialogue, acting, and direction of the characters of the parents are wooden and predictable. Again, just compare the sympathy you feel for the mothers in `The Exorcist' and `The Shining' and you can see the difference immediately.The biggest problem I felt with the movie is that it was never completely clear if the little boy clone was perp or victim to the supernatural forces driving his actions in the last third of the movie. I will not give away the final explanation in the event you look forward to watching the movie, but my overall feeling is that in spite of some scary moments depending more on clever camera work and editing a la `Psycho' shower scene than on real mounting suspense, this movie simply does not work.As an aside, I wondered how the Godsend Corporation for which DeNiro worked could explain its name, based on something the movie admits as being totally illegal. One review of this DVD in my local paper says that this movie proves that DeNiro will do anything for money. I actually don't begrudge DeNiro his dinaro from this flick. I simply won't be a part to encouraging people to see it.Also, as a student of book and movie blurbs, I discover on this cover a new source, reviews in `Netflix'.

However, I think most reviewers have missed the point completely. I don't care if it is supposed to be a horror movie or not, in my opinion, it should be a wake-up call in regards to genetic manipulation. Aha!! That's why I think this movie should get at least 5 stars.  In a very short time in the future, movies like Godsend will not be classified as Science-fiction anymore. Science will be able to provide us with a living cloned human being (or maybe it has already) When this happens, ""Godsend"" will make a lot more sense to the reviewers who underated this movie. The downside is, that cloning is a brutal attack against the naural order and therefore should be forever banned.  This movie and ""the Sixth Day"" show us the atrocities we will face in the future when unscrupulous scientists, (like the doctor in this one) introduce in the clones their hidden agendas with  horrifying repercussions.  Don't be fooled, they are already messing around with stem cells and human embryos.  Soon (if not already), genetic manipulation will be the downfall of humankind; the end of life as we know it.

I tend to agree with this outlook. By experimenting with society's fears of genetic cloning and stem cell research, combined with Greg Kinnear's exceptional acting abilities, ""Godsend"" comes extremely close to being as good a movie as something along the lines of ""Sixth Sense."" Unfortunately, a few flaws that initially seemed minor make the movie fail, although not completely, as a plausible and rewarding experience. Even with Robert Deniro playing a cold, emotionless scientist, who scientifically experiments with nature without any regard for how his manipulations will effect those around him (reflecting societies prejudice and fears against the sterile, objective environment of the scientific community), he is suprisingly too one-dimensional, and doesn't give his character enough depth to make the viewer care one way or another about him. Greg Kinnear and Rebecca Stamos convincingly play two caring and doting parents, and the child who played their son did a great job of coming off as creepy and sadistic with his multiple personality complex. Yet, the plot is hardly believable, and there were many parts of the movie concerning the scientific premise from which the boy's affliction stemmed from that I had a difficult time suspending my disbelief for. Still, I found myself guessing throughout most of the movie, and found it nail bitingly suspenseful, although the attempt to explain the reasons for the boy's split personality as a natural cause determined through a genetic experiment was unsatisfactory, unconvincing, and disappointing as coming from a realistic point of view and I wish they would have replaced it with an unrealistic, but more entertaining supernatural cause.3 stars for Kinnear's performance and the few terrifing thrills that that this movie provided for an otherwise boring night.",3,"A good movie, but not great",1093737600,"08 29, 2004",2004,1946,"['Someone', 'once', 'said', 'art', 'society', 'fears', 'concerns', 'subconscious', 'level', 'make', 'best', 'horror', 'tend', 'agree', 'outlook', 'experimenting', 'society', 'fears', 'genetic', 'cloning', 'stem', 'cell', 'research', 'combined', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'exceptional', 'acting', 'abilities', 'Godsend', 'extremely', 'close', 'being', 'as', 'good', 'movie', 'something', 'lines', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Unfortunately', 'few', 'flaws', 'initially', 'seemed', 'minor', 'make', 'movie', 'fail', 'not', 'completely', 'plausible', 'rewarding', 'experience', 'Even', 'Robert', 'Deniro', 'playing', 'cold', 'emotionless', 'scientist', 'who', 'scientifically', 'nature', 'regard', 'how', 'manipulations', 'will', 'effect', 'reflecting', 'societies', 'prejudice', 'fears', 'sterile', 'objective', 'environment', 'scientific', 'community', 'suprisingly', 'too', 'one-dimensional', ""n't"", 'give', 'character', 'enough', 'depth', 'make', 'viewer', 'care', 'one', 'way', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'Rebecca', 'Stamos', 'convincingly', 'play', 'two', 'caring', 'doting', 'parents', 'child', 'who', 'played', 'son', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'coming', 'off', 'creepy', 'sadistic', 'multiple', 'personality', 'complex', 'plot', 'hardly', 'believable', 'were', 'many', 'parts', 'movie', 'concerning', 'scientific', 'premise', 'boy', 'affliction', 'stemmed', 'had', 'difficult', 'time', 'suspending', 'disbelief', 'Still', 'found', 'guessing', 'most', 'movie', 'found', 'nail', 'bitingly', 'suspenseful', 'attempt', 'explain', 'reasons', 'boy', 'split', 'personality', 'natural', 'cause', 'determined', 'genetic', 'experiment', 'was', 'unsatisfactory', 'unconvincing', 'disappointing', 'coming', 'realistic', 'point', 'view', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'replaced', 'unrealistic', 'more', 'entertaining', 'supernatural', 'cause.3', 'stars', 'Kinnear', 'performance', 'few', 'terrifing', 'thrills', 'movie', 'provided', 'otherwise', 'boring', 'night']",Godsend

That is until they meet Richard Wells (De Niro) who offers them an alternative to grieving...cloning.  He promises that he can resurect their son Adam and they can experience his life all over again.  Of course they are interested, Jessie moreso than Paul who is a bit sceptical, and they eventually cave in and agree.  This uproots their whole life, moving them away from friends and family so that no one can know what they are about to do (beings that it's illegal).  The only problem is that as Adam passes the mark of is death he starts to act strangely, and he forms a unique bond with Richard that is starting to weird out Paul.This movie had so much potential, and with a little tweaking of the script it could have been all it should have been.  The fact remains that the scares are few and far in between and the character development is really B-Movie status.  There are a few jumps but they are hard to relive, and the ending just falls so short of what it could have been.  Robert De Niro is one of the best actors we have, but even he can't save this movie from mediocricy.  Cameron Bright is the only actor that gives De Niro a run for his money, chewing up his role perfectly.  This kid just looks scary, but he's far better performed in 'Birth' then this.

I don't want to give the ending away, so I'll just say it can be very disappointing - De Niro's character is very vague about the cloning procedure and how his own addition to the DNA (from a source I shan't name) caused a disruption in Adam's personality.I agree with most reviews - it could have been a little better.

The concept of cloning another human is an intriguing and frightening premise. Director Nick Hamm is revered as one of Britain's foremost authorities in theatrical direction, though ""Godsend"" marked his first major venture in filmmaking. The casting of Robert De Niro as the enigmatic Dr. Richard Wells seemed like a superb call.As it turns out, ""Godsend"" is one of the most pathetic excuses in horror ever to stain celluloid.Ever desperate for cheap thrills, ""Godsend,"" contrary to its title, is a hastily produced picture sent via the moviemaking underworld.The film impatiently attempts to duplicate the creepy success of M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Sixth Sense,"" only to find itself laughably arduous. The sights and sounds that unfolded around Haley Joel Osment's character in ""The Sixth Sense"" genuinely were disturbing.In ""Godsend,"" witnessing gangrenous arms poke out of the shadows is about the only slightly bothersome imagery.

Instead, I try to set myself up to be terrified witless. Time and time again, I erected the dominoes to scaredom during ""Godsend"" only to be disappointed when the knock-over effect came to a halt midway.

I have to say that the film does not live up to the expectations.WARNING: POTENTIAL SPOILERSThere are quite a few parts to the film that are interesting - mostly those that deal with Adam's nightmares. However, most of those nightmares never seem to tie in with the story. For example, why was Adam/Zachary shouting at the window, in the first dream? Second, we know that Zachary wasn't drowned in the tub by the housekeeper. Why was the hand that grabbed Adam all veiny and blue (like the hand of a drowning victim)? Third, why does Zachary's appearance coincide with the date of Adam's death? And fourth, the whole incident with Adam being dragged into the closet was a bit too real - since dreams don't open doors and drag victims into closets. What exactly was that about? These are a few of the many plot holes you have to ignore to actually like the film.END OF SPOILERSWhile interesting in concept, this film is very poorly put together.

831403,A3RSB9GI36XA55,B0002DRDQE,Jayson Orelans,"[9, 11]","Talk about your false advertisment! This film is in NO WAY a Godsend. It is a train wreck waiting to happen. And the sharp robotic movements need to stop!Do not think for one second that just because Robert De Niro stars in this horrid Sci-fi thriller, that it's the bee's knees. In fact, don't even think about this trashy film at all. Playing the mad scientist in this dopey piece of schlock about some cloning crap I could care less about, De Niro mostly sleep walks through the role, leaving the heavy emotions to his unlucky co-stars.The plot of Godsend seems lifted from one of those trashy, cheap horror paperbacks you'd buy in the airport to kill time on a layover-and then leave on the plane! The movie begins with a biology teacher (Greg Kinnear) bringing his son a gift. The mom (Rebecca Romjin-Stamos) takes her talkative, hyper, and downright annoying son, Adam (Some kid, probably another Culkin) out to do some Mother-Son shopping. This film has many inconsistences abound as Stamos looks more like Adam's yappy babysitter than his mother and Stamos looks practically like jailbait standing next to Kinnear!ANYWAYZThe brat is killed off in a freak accident and this is when the film's pacing comes to a screeching HALT! Enter Dr. Richard Wells (The best actor in the world, Mr. Robert De Niro) who tells the young couple how he can give them back their son in a new procedure. The mom is all too ready to jump in, while pop is indifferent.When 'Adam 2' is born, he is the mirror image of the first Adam (complete with that annoying, whiny voice).'Adam' reaches his eighth birthday and begins to act crazy and have night terrors. This is when the film gets too absurd for anyone with an IQ higher than 60. Cheap scares, irrelvance, fuzzy logic. This is when you should turn off the film.It really hurts to know that De Niro actually signed up for this rubbish. You would think that with all those other great films under his belt (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Cape Fear), he would pass on this trash. One can tell the producers had to pay De Niro a large sum of cash to appear in this crap, and it shows! This movie has the worst special effects that look straight out the 1980's!The two parents are helpless ( in acting skills as well) as thier rebellious, angst-driven 'son' runs amock spitting in teacher's faces, throwing temper tantrums, screaming, smoking, setting fires, exploding microwaves, swearing, and even offing fellow schoolmates.Kinnear seems to be confused in his role. He doesn't know if he wants to be the Seventh Heaven father or Al Pacino. He breaks character beyond excuse and is unintentionally funny whenever he says ""Adam?"" or when he's rambling on about stupid stuff. The only time Kinnear tries his hardest not to break character is in the film's laughable climax when he confronts De Niro. De Niro, on the other hand looks like he's about to laugh his head off through the entire scene!Rebecca Romjin-Stamos is the weak link in the acting chain of this film. Her role is basically reduced to screaming ""Adam!"" in every scene or crying her eyes out to the point that it gets annoying with her Dana Scully haircut. She is given little to do except walk around an old Victorian house with an early '90's cordless telophone in one hand and a Michael Myers kitchen knife in the other.As far as the musical score goes.............bah! You've heard better pieces from your uncle who always sings in the shower. The musician of this film decided that banging random notes on a keyboard was good music. Some of the pieces sound like they've went through your mother's old Hoover vacuum cleaner. One piece sounds like a slower and more subdued version of Michael Jack's ""Thriller""! Well, horrible movies should have horrible music to accompany it.This film left the viewer with more questions than answers. Not one question was answered after the mediocre ending. Who and what are Watchers, and why has one of them gone beserk? What ever happened to Dr. Richard Wells? How exactly had Wells gotten Zachary's DNA if Zachary had been burned to a crisp? Did they even suspect that Adam killed that boy? Why did Adam wanna bump off his mom?  And finally, who and what exactly is Adam at the end of this stupid film?What a mess this film is! This movie is the equilvalent to a forty car pile-up that happens right on I-95! A pretty dumb plot, bad acting on almost all of the actors, and stupidness. The film suffers most when the lead actors are walking around on the screen together. De Niro looks wooden and stiff, Kinnear looks like he forgot his lines, Stamos looks like she has a bad hangover, and the brat seems a little too interested. The actors are a little fine alone, but Kinnear and Stamos lack chemistry and leaves the viewer with a bad taste in their mouth. De Niro and Kinnear look like this is all a joke.  Why is the brat always hyper?! Stop that! I wasted a good one hundred some odd minutes that I can never get back on this 'movie' just to see actors who look like they've been abducted by aliens and then sent back to Earth trying to remember the last past two hours.And the refrences to other films needs to stop! This film took from Sixth Sense, The Exorcist, and a little undertones of The Shining. Neither of which can save the movie (just like Mr. De Niro). With dumb characters, dumb acting, and '80's grade special effects, it's a wonder why this film wasn't released on a 'straight-to-video' basis. Who's gonna clean up this mess? Not me!

Maybe De Niro is ready and willing to retire, but lacks the financial security. Driven to desperation, he might be jumping on any lame script that crosses his desk. I'm reminded of the twilight of Orson Welles' career, during which the once-heralded filmmaker and actor resorted to TV spots and cartoon voiceover work to pay the bills.The story, such as it is: A couple (Greg Kinnear and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) lose their son (Cameron Bright) in a car accident shortly after his eighth birthday. A mad scientist (De Niro) appears out of the woodwork and talks them into letting him clone their late son. When their newly-cloned son reaches the age of eight, all hell breaks loose...or it would, if this were a better movie.Perhaps in an effort to keep a PG-13 rating or perhaps due to a lack of imagination, the ""hell"" that is unleashed amounts to nothing more than naughty behavior and bad dreams. By the time the evil clone ups the ante, the story has dragged on uneventfully for far too long, piling improbability on improbability.I'm not even going to get into the questionable science at the core of the film's premise.My advice to you: Watch _The Omen_ and _The Omen II_ instead of this garbage. They aren't exactly great movies either, but they're in a similar vein (innocent looking caucasian boy is actually evil incarnate) and they're more entertaining by far.My advice to Robert De Niro: Unless you want audiences to wonder why you were ever considered an A-list actor, you'd better stay away from stinkers like this in the future.",1,A waste of DeNiro's talent and your time,1121904000,"07 21, 2005",2005,1620,"['When', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'film', 'bad', 'cry', 'help', 'Maybe', 'De', 'Niro', 'ready', 'willing', 'retire', 'financial', 'security', 'Driven', 'desperation', 'might', 'be', 'jumping', 'lame', 'script', 'desk', ""'m"", 'reminded', 'twilight', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'career', 'once-heralded', 'filmmaker', 'actor', 'resorted', 'TV', 'spots', 'cartoon', 'voiceover', 'work', 'pay', 'bills.The', 'story', 'such', 'couple', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'Rebecca', 'Romijn-Stamos', 'lose', 'son', 'Cameron', 'Bright', 'car', 'accident', 'shortly', 'eighth', 'birthday', 'mad', 'scientist', 'De', 'Niro', 'woodwork', 'talks', 'letting', 'clone', 'late', 'son', 'When', 'newly-cloned', 'son', 'age', 'eight', 'hell', 'breaks', 'loose', 'would', 'were', 'better', 'movie.Perhaps', 'effort', 'keep', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'perhaps', 'due', 'lack', 'imagination', 'hell', 'unleashed', 'amounts', 'nothing', 'more', 'naughty', 'behavior', 'bad', 'dreams', 'time', 'evil', 'clone', 'ups', 'ante', 'story', 'dragged', 'uneventfully', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'piling', 'improbability', 'improbability.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'going', 'get', 'questionable', 'science', 'core', 'film', 'premise.My', 'advice', 'Watch', '_The', 'Omen_', '_The', 'Omen', 'II_', 'instead', 'garbage', 'are', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'great', 'movies', ""'re"", 'similar', 'vein', 'innocent', 'looking', 'caucasian', 'boy', 'actually', 'evil', 'incarnate', ""'re"", 'more', 'entertaining', 'far.My', 'advice', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'want', 'audiences', 'wonder', 'why', 'were', 'ever', 'considered', 'A-list', 'actor', ""'d"", 'better', 'stay', 'away', 'stinkers', 'future']",Godsend

Rarely do I make such statements about movies, hoping to find some good in them that makes them worthy of at least three stars(read my reviews of SciFi Channel flicks if you don't believe me).  Unfortunately, ""Godsend"" takes a contemporary subject(cloning) and turns it into a bad rehash of ""Frankenstein"" with Robert De Niro playing the deranged scientist hoping to play the Big Man.  Throw in Greg Kinnear as the only decent acting person in this movie and Rebecca Romjin for eye-candy and you have plenty of potential.All of the elements were there:  1) a risky experiment involving both social mores and emotions  2) a mad scientist 3) a creepy, creepy kid  4) and alterior motives.  Sounds good, right, but everything falls flat before this horse even gets out of the gate.  It's a plodding, boring, dull film with no real attempt at being a good movie.  It's as if the writer was thinking that he could wrangle fans of ""The Forgotten"" and ""The X-files"" together and capitalize on them.  No sirree.In short, skip this snoozer that has a pitiful beginning, a boring middle, and a non-existent ending.

Take one mad scientist (DeNiro, who apparently has no shame about doing cheese ball roles like this), take two dumb but grief stricken parents (Kinnear, who spends the whole movie yelling  the same obscenity over and over and John Stamos's ex wife, who spends the whole movie crying, shrieking or looking shocked) and one creepy little kid (Cameron Bright) and you might get thrills and chills. Instead, you get a really bad film.First, it has significant plot and logic holes. The cloned lad looks just like the dead child that the parents lost. Although siblings resemble each other unless they're twins they aren't identical. The movie never shows the couple trying to explain this to their family and friends. Second, Kinnear makes an impossibly easy  visit to St. Pius, a school that was closed due to a fire 8 years ago. I can not think of a school official  in the United States who would let valuable property just sit like that for almost a decade. Not only is the half burnt school still there but Kinnear is able to break in and somehow goes to the exact classroom that holds the clue he needs. When he gets to the classroom he picks up the exact drawing that helpfully has the name and address of the place he needs to visit next.Later Kinnear shows up at the address and meets that old staple of the horror film, THE OLD FAMILY SERVANT, in this case she is also the BLACK PERSON WHO KNOWS WHAT'S GOING ON AND HAS WAITED YEARS TO TELL IT.  If a crazed looking stranger showed up at my door I'd call the cops. In Godsend, the  old family servant lets him in. Thanks  to this helpful plot device Kinnear finds out that --- golly--- the mad scientist pulled a fast one and instead of a perfect clone of his dead son he's saddled with a clone of the scientist's dead psychotic child. Oopsy!You then have the typical frantic car ride back home to rescue his wife who's about to end up like Lee Remick in the Omen. On the way Kinnear gets into a fight with DeNiro and a fire breaks out in a church that only a second before was filled with people attending a funeral. Apparently nobody stopped to go to the bathroom and nobody is still in the parking lot loading the coffin into a hearse. Okaaaaaay. The fire is apparently no biggie to the cops or fireman because 6 months go by afterwards and none of the leads has to explain their part in an apparent arson. Kinnear and Stamos have a baby Ted Bundy on their hands and their solution is to just move to a different town.  The movie has that same old trick ending (everything looks peaceful and then something scary happens) that we've seen a hundred times before.

831413,A2460ZRFVC2YGV,B0002DRDQE,Kristopher Haines,"[18, 22]","I thought ""Godsend"" was going to be a science fiction thriller along the lines of Gattacca. I thought it might even be sort of a hybrid of ""Gatticca"" and ""A.I."" The ""Gattacca"" angle would deal with the ethical issues surrounding the manipulation of genetics to suit our own desires. The ""A.I."" angle would come into play because the couple is trying to REPLACE their dead son. This issue was explored far too briefly in ""A.I."" partly because the son was able to come back to life. Plus, ""A.I."" had many more issues to tackle because the child was non-human: the hazards of unconditional love, what we as humans owe to what we create, issues of man vs. machine, obseletism, etc. etc. etc. ""Godsend"" on the other hand deals only with humans, and some interesting issues are raised but never resolved, in favor of being just another evil child horror film. The first of these intriguing issues is one that has been raised countless times, which has a larger role in determining who we are, nature or nurture? The second is the far-fetched but no less interesting concept of cellular memory. The third question raised is what would happen if the replacement discovered he was only a replacement? Adam, (the clone) stumbles upon pictures of the other Adam but the need to explain the photos is forgotten as the clone once again succumbs to homicidal urges. The issue of destiny is also explored briefly, (the new Adam has many close calls with automobiles, the instrument of the previous Adam's demise.)OK, I know some of you are saying, ""Once you found out it was a horror film why didn't you just stay home? It's not the film's fault it wasn't what you wanted."" To that I say, if it had to be horror, is it too much to ask that it be good horror? The film is purely a collection of scenes designed to make you jump, and I have to say that most of them accomplished that goal. Yet, I have cerebral palsy, which means along with many other nasty things, nature has cursed me with a hair-trigger startle reflex, and even with that working in the film's favor some of the ""startle scenes"" failed to hit their mark. This alone is testament to the film's gross inadequacy. And lets not forget the horrible writing and acting. If I had parents that said those cutesy-poo things to me, I would have thrown myself in front of that car on purpose.

What they do not tell you is this is one of the first cinematic endeavors trying to exploit the new science of cloning, which has been successful with cats and birds around the world.What the script sought, no doubt, was to state arguments about whether cloning is or can be a life-assisting tool. The Greg Kinnear character, who begins the film on the moral high ground, immediately states the case against cloning but yields to his wife (Rebecca Romjin, looking much too young to have fathered a pair of 8-year-olds back to back), who can no longer procreate and wants her dead kid back.The Robert DeNiro character, a doctor and genius, is the amoral foil to Kinnear, who suggests the medical experiment is a way to metaphorically put Humpty Dumpty back together again in the couple's now shattered empty void of a life.With this premise, the film could have migrated in many directions, all of which could have argued the case for or against the new science of cloning, which evidence worldwide has shown actually works.What the movie did instead was become a typical horror film in the Damien strain, without any of the requisite style or fright that makes those movies famous and gives them lasting value.Still, I thought there were some good things herein. The movie was effective for about an hour or 70 minutes, until the time the DeNiro character showed his true ways. Once exposed, that portion of the plot became quicksand as attempts at cheap thrills and faux horror instead replaced intelligence in the script.I also enjoyed DeNiro's perforamnce as an understated medical quack willing to be pushed around by the milquetoast-turned-he man Kinnear over the treatment of his cloned boy. This is a far different character than the ones DeNiro has portrayed in his gangster, casino and New York films.So, like I always say in these bad movies, at least there is something to like about it. What is sad is that, given the overall plot mechanism revolving around the science of cloning, this film missed a large opportunity to cinematically explore a moral ground that has, thus far, not been examined in any meaningful way since ""Frankenstein"".And with an actor of DeNiro's stature on board to carry the goods, this could have been one of the memorable films of 2004 or any other year.

831415,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0002DRDQE,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[6, 8]","If you do not like the ending of ""Godsend"" do not worry, there are a whole bunch of other alternate endings for you not to like as well on the DVD.  It is not surprising that director Nick Hamm had trouble figuring out what ending he wanted for this 2004 film because Mark Bomback's story cannot decide what this movie is really about.  Given that the premise for this movie is the grief of parents who have lost their only children such indecisiveness is as troubling as it is confusing.The day after his 8th birthday Adam Duncan (Cameron Bright) is killed in an accident.  His distraught parents are approached by Dr. Richard Wells (Robert De Niro), who was one of the college professors of Jessie Duncan (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), who works out of her home as a photographer.  Wells does ground breaking rsearch in genetics and he wants to create a clone of Adam.  Paul Duncan (Greg Kinnear), a popular high school biology teacher, is initially resistant but his wife's grief and his own pain lead him to relent.  The Duncans move to Vermont where Wells has his private research facility.  Adam's cloned embryo is implanted in Jessie and she gives birth to a baby boy.The story then jumps ahead to the 8th birthday of this Adam, who is apparently quite similar to his predecessor except for a different haircut (which is important because it allows us to distinguish between the two version of Adam).  One of the problems with cloning to replace a child or a pet that has died is that even if the clone looks the same, it will not be the same on the inside.  Certainly Adam's mommy and daddy are more protective the second time around, the kid now lives in a rural area rather than the inner city, and the last eight years have certainly been quite different from the previous eight.  I can remember trying to explain to my students that the world is different when a young president is killed but an older president survives an assassination attempt, and the decades of the 1960s and the 1980s would certainly bear that out.But it is important for the story that Adam be essentially the same because when makes it to two days past his 8th birthday he has now lived longer than his predecessor.  That is when strange things start to happen.  That is because ""Godsend"" is one of those films that reduces the most complex types of science to mumbo-jumbo so that it is suddenly plausible that once the clone gets past the point where the original Adam died that things could go horribly wrong.  Adam is haunted by nightmares and visions, takes to calling the boy who ""lives inside"" him Zachary, and now we are in the familiar film territory of the demon child.But then it turns out there is another ""scientific"" explanation for why Adam seems to be having memories of his previous existence, and suddenly I am wondering if I have flipped channels and ended up in another movie.  Since I am watching ""Godsend"" on DVD, this proves not to be the case, but this movie just goes jumping off the deep end while it revisits most of the clich&eacute;s involving demon children, mad scientists, and dark places.  There is a point where Kinnear's character finds out what is really going on and is deeply offended at how he has been exploited, which is exactly how many viewers will feel when they watch ""Godsend.""  This film is technically competent, but reveals itself to be emotionally hollow and intellectually suspect.I checked this movie out because I had just seen young Cameron Bright in ""Birth"" and I am always looking for a good horror thriller.  ""Godsend"" is not even close to being that movie.  Kinnear's performance is the most heartfelt in the film, but it is not like the script gives any of the characters anything substantial to do and provides De Niro with the worst piece of drivel he has ever had to say on screen.  Bright knows how to look eerie, but I already knew that going in, which is also true about Romijn-Stamos's looks.  By the time I got to all those alternate endings (whose ample evidence of indecisiveness led me to drop another star from the film's final rating) I was totally convinced that what ""Godsend"" really needed to do was end at the point where the second Adam was older than the first and tell the human drama of a family trying to recreate what had been lost, instead of this botched horror thriller.",2,Adding insult to injury on a couple who lose their son,1101081600,"11 22, 2004",2004,4334,"['do', 'not', 'ending', 'Godsend', 'do', 'not', 'worry', 'are', 'whole', 'bunch', 'other', 'alternate', 'endings', 'not', 'like', 'as', 'well', 'DVD', 'not', 'surprising', 'director', 'Nick', 'Hamm', 'had', 'trouble', 'figuring', 'out', 'what', 'ending', 'wanted', '2004', 'film', 'Mark', 'Bomback', 'story', 'can', 'not', 'decide', 'what', 'movie', 'really', 'about', 'Given', 'premise', 'movie', 'grief', 'parents', 'who', 'have', 'lost', 'only', 'children', 'such', 'indecisiveness', 'as', 'troubling', 'confusing.The', 'day', '8th', 'birthday', 'Adam', 'Duncan', 'Cameron', 'Bright', 'killed', 'accident', 'distraught', 'parents', 'are', 'approached', 'Dr.', 'Richard', 'Wells', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'who', 'was', 'one', 'college', 'professors', 'Jessie', 'Duncan', 'Rebecca', 'Romijn-Stamos', 'who', 'home', 'photographer', 'Wells', 'ground', 'breaking', 'rsearch', 'genetics', 'create', 'clone', 'Adam', 'Paul', 'Duncan', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'popular', 'high', 'school', 'biology', 'teacher', 'initially', 'resistant', 'wife', 'grief', 'own', 'pain', 'lead', 'relent', 'Duncans', 'move', 'Vermont', 'where', 'Wells', 'private', 'research', 'facility', 'Adam', 'cloned', 'embryo', 'implanted', 'Jessie', 'birth', 'baby', 'boy.The', 'story', 'then', 'ahead', '8th', 'birthday', 'Adam', 'who', 'apparently', 'quite', 'similar', 'predecessor', 'different', 'haircut', 'important', 'distinguish', 'two', 'version', 'Adam', 'One', 'problems', 'cloning', 'replace', 'child', 'pet', 'died', 'even', 'clone', 'same', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'same', 'inside', 'Certainly', 'Adam', 'mommy', 'daddy', 'are', 'more', 'protective', 'second', 'time', 'kid', 'now', 'rural', 'area', 'rather', 'inner', 'city', 'last', 'eight', 'years', 'have', 'certainly', 'been', 'quite', 'different', 'previous', 'eight', 'can', 'remember', 'trying', 'explain', 'students', 'world', 'different', 'when', 'young', 'president', 'killed', 'older', 'president', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'decades', '1960s', '1980s', 'would', 'certainly', 'bear', 'out.But', 'important', 'story', 'Adam', 'be', 'essentially', 'same', 'when', 'two', 'days', '8th', 'birthday', 'now', 'lived', 'longer', 'predecessor', 'when', 'strange', 'things', 'start', 'happen', 'Godsend', 'one', 'films', 'most', 'complex', 'types', 'science', 'mumbo-jumbo', 'so', 'suddenly', 'plausible', 'once', 'clone', 'point', 'where', 'original', 'Adam', 'died', 'things', 'could', 'go', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'Adam', 'haunted', 'nightmares', 'visions', 'calling', 'boy', 'who', 'inside', 'Zachary', 'now', 'are', 'familiar', 'film', 'territory', 'demon', 'child.But', 'then', 'out', 'scientific', 'explanation', 'why', 'Adam', 'be', 'having', 'memories', 'previous', 'existence', 'suddenly', 'am', 'wondering', 'have', 'flipped', 'channels', 'ended', 'up', 'movie', 'am', 'watching', 'Godsend', 'DVD', 'not', 'be', 'case', 'movie', 'just', 'jumping', 'off', 'deep', 'end', 'most', 'clich', 'eacute', 'involving', 'demon', 'children', 'mad', 'scientists', 'dark', 'places', 'point', 'where', 'Kinnear', 'character', 'out', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'deeply', 'offended', 'how', 'been', 'exploited', 'exactly', 'how', 'many', 'viewers', 'will', 'feel', 'when', 'watch', 'Godsend', 'film', 'technically', 'competent', 'be', 'emotionally', 'hollow', 'intellectually', 'suspect.I', 'checked', 'movie', 'had', 'just', 'seen', 'young', 'Cameron', 'Bright', 'Birth', 'am', 'always', 'looking', 'good', 'horror', 'thriller', 'Godsend', 'not', 'even', 'close', 'being', 'movie', 'Kinnear', 'performance', 'most', 'heartfelt', 'film', 'not', 'script', 'characters', 'anything', 'substantial', 'do', 'De', 'Niro', 'worst', 'piece', 'drivel', 'ever', 'had', 'say', 'screen', 'Bright', 'how', 'look', 'eerie', 'already', 'knew', 'going', 'also', 'true', 'Romijn-Stamos', 'looks', 'time', 'got', 'alternate', 'endings', 'ample', 'evidence', 'indecisiveness', 'led', 'drop', 'star', 'film', 'final', 'rating', 'was', 'totally', 'convinced', 'what', 'Godsend', 'really', 'needed', 'do', 'was', 'end', 'point', 'where', 'second', 'Adam', 'was', 'older', 'first', 'tell', 'human', 'drama', 'family', 'trying', 'recreate', 'what', 'had', 'been', 'lost', 'instead', 'botched', 'horror', 'thriller']",Godsend

Gref Kinnear and Rebecca Romijn play a couple who loses their only son in unexpected tragedy. Just when the funeral ends, out comes Robert de Niro, as doctor/researcher, to save the day. He promises the emotially vulnerable parents he can bring back their son, though the word cloning is never mentioned.After some hesitation on Greg Kinnear's part, the grieving parents opt to go with the good doctor's advice and try to bring back their little boy. They should have known it was a bad idea as soon as Dr. DeNiro promised them free treatment, a house and job 300 miles from where they live. The educated couple miss all the red flags and go along with what will surely be a human genetic engineering story gone terribly wrong.At first, everything seems perfect. The baby born to them looks exactly like their son, and they even give him the same name, Adam. Adam was the first man on earth and he is also the first evil clone. Things go awry when Adam passes his eighth birthday and lives longer than his original self. He becomes distant, does not always respond to his name and starts bullying kids at school. The radical change in behavior alarms the parents, but not nearly enough until it is almost too late. If you've seenThe Omenor read some of Robin Cook's medical thrillers, you can predict the ending ofGodsenda good hour before it happens.

There should be no way to miss. But this clunker misses over and over in spite of its many opportunities to achieve.It has De Niro. It has an unsettling story line and a good novel as its basis. A dead child, a secluded location, bad dreams and weird science. How can you go wrong with all that?Somehow, it goes wrong and horribly so. This film falls flat from the beginning regardless of those delicious ingredients. The story itself is muddy and new layers are added regularly without finesse. Tired cliches don't result in the chills they so obviously were meant to inspire. The child, clearly meant to provide spookiness through the mystery of his birth, is far from spooky. You cannot simply paste a blank expression on a boy of eight and expect an audience to recoil. You cannot simply set a scene in a shadowy, sprawling house and expect that atmosphere to carry that scene to the audience.The Godsend had promise but failed to deliver.

So the parents go after the doctor and after 70 minutes we find out that doc put some of his dead killer child's memories in the clone, the dad fights with the doctor over this, they both survive and then they move away from one another.

What is so wrong here? The ""parents"" are believable indeed, Kinnear is good in his ""father""-part. De Niro is doing his job too -though perhaps no big role, his worst? I don't think so. Back to the female actress, perhaps no Academy-worthy acting here -but anything but embarrassing!""Godsend"" does not set out to be anything else than what you get, ""all"" trailers are mostly ""better"" than their movies outcome -especially those from thrillers. The ending, not the most remembarable -but because it is an ""open"" ending. What do you believe happened with the family?

831436,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0002DRDQE,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[3, 5]","Godsend (Nick Hamm, 2004)Oh, how the mighty have fallen.Godsend concerns a couple, Paul and Jessie Duncan (Grek Kinnear and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) whose child is killed in an auto accident. A former professor of Jessie's, Richard Wells (Robert DeNiro), approaches them not long after the funeral and makes them an offer that they somehow can't refuse-- cloning their son. Everything goes well until the son, Adam (Cameron Bright, of the upcoming X-Men 3), passes the age at which his former self died. Then, things start going a little weird...Now, the movie itself is cheeseball enough. DeNiro, whose career has pretty much gone into the toilet recently from a quality standpoint (viz. Meet the Parents/Fockers, The Score, Analyze This/That, etc. etc. ad nauseam), turns in what is essentially his usual twenty-first century performance; it's passable, but it's not the guy who won two acting Oscars and was nominated for four others. Kinnear, and Romijn-Stamos, at least, don't have stellar careers behind them to make us wonder where things went so horribly wrong that they needed the money this desparately; both turn in reasonable performances given that the parts they're playing are incredibly silly. Bright does his best to be a happy-go-lucky kid one minute and suitably scary the next, but can't quite pull it off. (They should've changed the sex of the kid and pulled in Dakota Fanning, who pretty much defines creepy these days.) But without one scene, it would've been another predictable below-average piece of celluloid cheese, good for turning your brain off for a couple of hours and nothing more.But no. Hamm, making his first picture in America, was perhaps unaware of the way some things work on this side of the pond-- specifically, product placement. It's pretty obvious Homestyle Bakes paid good, good money for product placement in this movie, because during one scene-- a climactic one, no less, where great pieces of the plot are revealed to the five people who didn't see them coming-- there's a shelf full of Homestyle Bakes in almost every camera angle, and the product placement is so obvious that at times the camera almost risks going out of focus on Kinnear to make sure THE AUDIENCE SEES THESE HOMESTYLE BAKES. The effect is, quite simply hilarious. It's a good thing the movie's so predictable, because if you didn't see it coming, you'd be laughing too hard to miss the big reveal.Pathetic.

Surely the topic deserves to be made into a film again, but few things in `Godsend' actually could be called a success that is stimulating intellectually or else.The story is nothing new, but that is not a problem. For the record it is about newly bereaved husband and wife (played by Greg Kinnear and Rebecca Romijin), to whom a mysterious scientist (Robert De Niro) approaches, offering a chance to resurrect their dead son by a still experimental method. As this is not based on a Michael Crichton novel, the film skips any scientific details as to the method and its plausibility. All we have to do is to see and believe it.Anyway, things go pretty well for the parents at first, but then they find something awfully wrong with what they thought as `Godsend' - of course they find it - but how they find it is really problematic. I cannot reveal too much about it, not because doing so would spoil your fun, but because you just don't get much fun from the beginning. I hate to say these things in this sarcastic manner, but before the director Nick Hamm (`The Hole' starring Keira Knightley) builds up the atmosphere, it all vanishes into the air with thrill-less acting and suspense-free script.Not that the film is totally devoid of eerie moments. Thanks to effective acting from Cameron Bright as the named Adam, there are some minor shocks. Because of the decent performances from the Kinnear and Romijin, the portrait of the ordinary family who suffer looks fairly convincing, but, oh, no, please someone tell Mr. Robert De Niro that he doesn't need to work so hard if he got as many as six Oscar nominations in his career (and won two!). His last nomination was back in 1992 for his acting in `Cape Fear' but since then I haven't seen him in a good film that matches his reputation in the 70s and 80s. OK, I loved `Meet the Parents' and `Analyze This' but not its sequels, let alone `Hide and Seek' `Showtime' '15 Minutes' and oh, dear, `The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle.'

831447,AI0PLL5DQAHRG,B0002DRDQE,"Ty Arthur ""xFiruath""","[3, 3]","Viewing the trailers for the movie ""Godsend"", it is abundantly clear that the individuals marketing this movie would like to show their potential audience that the film is a thought provoking thriller that raises all sorts of questions about the nature of humanity and the moral implications of cloning a previously deceased human being (and presumably presenting some kind of answer to those questions).  Those individuals were gleefully lying through their teeth.Godsend starts off with plenty of potential to be a great movie.  The viewers are introduced to the happily married Paul and Jessie Duncan, and their young son Adam, who is celebrating his birthday.  All the cutesy young son birthday antics occur, letting everyone know just how much the couple loves their only child.  After everyone is sufficiently indoctrinated with the fact that these people *really* love their kid, he is of course offed by a wayward vehicle that apparently felt like flying through the air and crushing a poor youngster in front of his mother.  Enter genius doctor specializing in fertility, Robert De Niro to seemingly resurrect the dead through advanced cloning techniques.  Herein it would appear the movie is about to start making some kind of point.  Five seconds later about 3/4 of the people watching Godsend are going to understand the ""twist"" that occurs later on, all they while hoping fervently that they are wrong, they just misread the signs, this couldn't possibly happen in this film. Of course, they are unfortunately all correct.For no apparent reason Godsend descends from intelligent ethical questioning of modern day science into a ""jump at the sudden sound"" quasi-horror movie with no purpose whatsoever.  If only it had been marketed as such from the beginning!  As a sudden shock style horror movie, it actually isn't all that bad.  There have certainly been much, much worse scary flicks.  Godsend does fall prey to the same pitfalls of all ""BOO!"" horror movies, such as the same scare occuring over and over, people running after someone screaming their name repeatedly even though it is quite clear they are neither going to turn around nor answer, and the  characters doing blatantly stupid things that make the audience throw their popcorn and yell ""Don't go down in the basement!!"". Despite all this, there are some geniunely effective uses of interesting camerawork coupled with slowly building music to produce a few noteworthy scenes.  However, anyone wanting to have a viewpoint expressed on the issues of mortality, cloning, resurrection, familial ties, destiny, or man's ability to play God should definitely pass by Godsend, as it doesn't even attempt to answer any of these questions that it half-heartedly raises.For those fortunate enough to know absolutely nothing about this movie, feel free to watch and enjoy a decent ride with pretty good acting by some big name stars.  Anyone one who was subjected to the insanely blatant lies of the trailers should understand that Godsend is simply a horror/thriller along the same vein as ""The Omen"" or ""The Good Son"" wrapped around a current hot issue to help it sell.",3,"Severely misrepresented, but at least watchable",1147651200,"05 15, 2006",2006,3140,"['Viewing', 'trailers', 'movie', 'Godsend', 'abundantly', 'clear', 'individuals', 'marketing', 'movie', 'would', 'like', 'show', 'potential', 'audience', 'film', 'thought', 'provoking', 'thriller', 'sorts', 'questions', 'nature', 'humanity', 'moral', 'implications', 'cloning', 'previously', 'deceased', 'human', 'being', 'presumably', 'presenting', 'kind', 'answer', 'questions', 'individuals', 'were', 'gleefully', 'lying', 'teeth.Godsend', 'plenty', 'potential', 'be', 'great', 'movie', 'viewers', 'are', 'introduced', 'happily', 'married', 'Paul', 'Jessie', 'Duncan', 'young', 'son', 'Adam', 'who', 'celebrating', 'birthday', 'cutesy', 'young', 'son', 'birthday', 'antics', 'occur', 'letting', 'everyone', 'know', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'couple', 'only', 'child', 'everyone', 'sufficiently', 'indoctrinated', 'fact', 'people', '*really*', 'love', 'kid', 'course', 'offed', 'wayward', 'vehicle', 'apparently', 'felt', 'flying', 'air', 'crushing', 'poor', 'youngster', 'front', 'mother', 'Enter', 'genius', 'doctor', 'specializing', 'fertility', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'seemingly', 'resurrect', 'dead', 'advanced', 'cloning', 'techniques', 'Herein', 'would', 'appear', 'movie', 'start', 'making', 'kind', 'point', 'Five', 'seconds', 'later', '3/4', 'people', 'watching', 'Godsend', 'are', 'going', 'understand', 'twist', 'later', 'hoping', 'fervently', 'are', 'wrong', 'just', 'misread', 'signs', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'happen', 'film', 'course', 'are', 'unfortunately', 'correct.For', 'apparent', 'reason', 'Godsend', 'intelligent', 'ethical', 'questioning', 'modern', 'day', 'science', 'jump', 'sudden', 'sound', 'quasi-horror', 'movie', 'purpose', 'whatsoever', 'only', 'had', 'been', 'marketed', 'such', 'beginning', 'sudden', 'shock', 'style', 'horror', 'movie', 'actually', ""n't"", 'bad', 'have', 'certainly', 'been', 'much', 'much', 'worse', 'scary', 'flicks', 'Godsend', 'fall', 'prey', 'same', 'pitfalls', 'BOO', 'horror', 'movies', 'such', 'same', 'scare', 'occuring', 'people', 'running', 'someone', 'screaming', 'name', 'repeatedly', 'even', 'quite', 'clear', 'are', 'going', 'turn', 'around', 'answer', 'characters', 'doing', 'blatantly', 'stupid', 'things', 'make', 'audience', 'throw', 'popcorn', 'yell', 'Do', ""n't"", 'go', 'down', 'basement', 'are', 'geniunely', 'effective', 'uses', 'interesting', 'camerawork', 'coupled', 'slowly', 'building', 'music', 'produce', 'few', 'noteworthy', 'scenes', 'However', 'anyone', 'wanting', 'have', 'viewpoint', 'expressed', 'issues', 'mortality', 'cloning', 'resurrection', 'familial', 'ties', 'destiny', 'man', 'ability', 'play', 'God', 'should', 'definitely', 'pass', 'Godsend', ""n't"", 'even', 'attempt', 'answer', 'questions', 'half-heartedly', 'raises.For', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'know', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'movie', 'feel', 'free', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'decent', 'ride', 'pretty', 'good', 'acting', 'big', 'name', 'stars', 'Anyone', 'one', 'who', 'was', 'subjected', 'insanely', 'blatant', 'lies', 'trailers', 'should', 'understand', 'Godsend', 'simply', 'horror/thriller', 'same', 'vein', 'Omen', 'Good', 'Son', 'wrapped', 'current', 'hot', 'issue', 'help', 'sell']",Godsend

Marshall,"[0, 0]","If you like evil kid movies this one may appeal to your senses but if you are looking for something that induces nightmares this film falls far short.This movie is basic at best and the storyline is entirely predictable. Rebecca Romijn-Stamos does a good job playing the over-protective and freaked out mother of the evil child, played unconvincingly by Cameron Bright. Completing the perfect family is Greg Kinnear who is the ever suspicious father in this modern nuclear family on the verge of destruction. Both parents spend the entire film speculating on what is happening to the child they created with a mad scientist, played brilliantly by Robert DeNiro. After losing their real son Stamos and Kinnear encounter DeNiro at their child's funeral and seem to happily go along with an illegal fertility procedure to clone the dead child. The story just seems very far fetched to me. First of all if a doctor is doing illegal procedures why is he stalking every funeral in town searching for candidates, isn't that a little too risky? Also why would parents who find themselves confronted with their child holding an axe just accept him as one of their own as soon as he says, ""It's me Daddy!"" Maybe this film is best left unquestioned.The best part of this DVD is the alternative endings with five or six different outcomes some are actually better than the ending of the film itself. But the scariest part of this movie is the sound! Most of the film is spent with the characters whispering their lines so that you find yourself turning up the volume only to have every picture on your wall vibrating when the so-called scary parts need added effect, the sound is much more terrifying than the scene. I was hoping for more of a psychological thriller with emphasis placed on the rights and wrongs of cloning human beings instead this film just warns you about making rash decisions after a funeral. Maybe we should just leave the decisions up to God and make another choice in a movie.",2,Creepy But Totally Predictable,1093824000,"08 30, 2004",2004,1989,"['like', 'evil', 'kid', 'movies', 'one', 'may', 'appeal', 'senses', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'film', 'far', 'short.This', 'movie', 'basic', 'best', 'storyline', 'entirely', 'predictable', 'Rebecca', 'Romijn-Stamos', 'good', 'job', 'playing', 'over-protective', 'freaked', 'out', 'mother', 'evil', 'child', 'played', 'unconvincingly', 'Cameron', 'Bright', 'Completing', 'perfect', 'family', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'who', 'ever', 'suspicious', 'father', 'modern', 'nuclear', 'family', 'verge', 'destruction', 'parents', 'spend', 'entire', 'film', 'speculating', 'what', 'happening', 'child', 'created', 'mad', 'scientist', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'losing', 'real', 'son', 'Stamos', 'Kinnear', 'encounter', 'DeNiro', 'child', 'funeral', 'seem', 'happily', 'go', 'along', 'illegal', 'fertility', 'procedure', 'clone', 'dead', 'child', 'story', 'just', 'very', 'far', 'fetched', 'First', 'all', 'doctor', 'doing', 'illegal', 'procedures', 'why', 'stalking', 'funeral', 'town', 'searching', 'candidates', ""n't"", 'little', 'too', 'risky', 'Also', 'why', 'would', 'parents', 'who', 'find', 'confronted', 'child', 'holding', 'axe', 'just', 'accept', 'one', 'own', 'as', 'soon', 'Daddy', 'Maybe', 'film', 'best', 'left', 'unquestioned.The', 'best', 'part', 'DVD', 'alternative', 'endings', 'five', 'six', 'different', 'outcomes', 'are', 'actually', 'better', 'ending', 'film', 'scariest', 'part', 'movie', 'sound', 'Most', 'film', 'spent', 'characters', 'whispering', 'lines', 'find', 'turning', 'up', 'volume', 'only', 'have', 'picture', 'wall', 'vibrating', 'when', 'so-called', 'scary', 'parts', 'need', 'added', 'effect', 'sound', 'much', 'more', 'terrifying', 'scene', 'was', 'hoping', 'more', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'emphasis', 'placed', 'rights', 'wrongs', 'cloning', 'human', 'beings', 'instead', 'film', 'just', 'making', 'rash', 'decisions', 'funeral', 'Maybe', 'should', 'just', 'leave', 'decisions', 'God', 'make', 'choice', 'movie']",Godsend
