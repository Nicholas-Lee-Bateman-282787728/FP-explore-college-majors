The reality is underscored by the loss of their homes because the Spanish and the Portugese view their lands as opportunities to expand their empire while harvesting them for resources. I seem to have thought that the missionaries played a scurvy trick on the Indians by converting them to Christians for the state's hidden agenda, but it's not the case in The Mission. There is a display of concern by the Jesuits in saving the Indians from a predictable wipe-out of their culture and habitat. Obviously, we all know how that went down. Naturally, the film demonstrates more reasons not to believe in religion and whatever the precepts of the church are because it's all hypocrisy. On the other hand, the performances by the cast is ordinary. Robert De Niro can do much better than what he did in the film; it's just a superficial transformation from being a murderer of his brother to a remorseful convert. Instead, he lets his beard and hair to do most of the work, and I am afraid that is not enough for me. Jeremy Irons is equally fine.

A fourth didn't notice that, in the ending, the broken violin was found, symbolically, in the water, not in the mission ruins. Are these people real? This is an exceptionally fine film, full of compassion and sorrow at the contemplation of man's vileness and greed, especially when coupled with the moral cowardice and corruption inherent in the administrators of a bureaucracy. A fat Cardinal would rather preserve his life of power and ease than follow the precepts of the founder of his religion. Ebert complains that the battle scenes are incoherent. What does he think war is? Neat and tidy? Everything the viewer needed to know was conveyed by these scenes: confusion, misery and desperation, resulting in a massacre of innocents.

Robert De Niro is a slave trader who one day kills his brother when he finds him in the arms of his fiance. He becomes guilt ridden, goes to the local monastery, and wishes to do penance. A missionary (Jeremy Irons) invites De Niro to return with him to his mission deep in the jungle; his penance is toting a heavy sack of material things behind him. Climbing up a huge waterfall he almost dies lugging this junk, but he refuses to let go. Finally, the Indians, whom he hates and vice-versa, cut the sack free, and he is overwhelmed by a feeling of forgiveness. He wants to join the Jesuits, and is reminded he will have to take a vow of obedience. From here on we can see what's coming, and what was once a powerful movie becomes more routine. Portuguese troops come to close the mission, and the Jesuits are ordered to leave by their superior. Of course, De Niro refuses and decides to fight it out to his death. (Irons disobeys orders, too, but sits and prays with the natives and does not fight.)

It, like any great work of art, is deliciously fecund, rewarding repeated viewings generously.This movie makes the 18th century vivid and real.  You never once feel you are watching a costume drama, as so often is the case with other historical films.  It envelopes you effortlessly in its world, making it feel very contemporary and relevant.The cast is, of course, legendary- Irons & DeNiro are laser spot on, as always.It is the supporting cast that truly seals the deal, though:Charles Low as the cruel, venal & avaricious representative of the Spanish crown Don Cabeza; and Ronald Pickup as the cool, humane & sardonic rep of the Portuguese crown are both extraordinary.  As is Ray McAnally who plays Cardinal Altamirano the papal legate.  Liam Neeson is great as one of the subordinate Jesuits; and Aidan Quinn rocks as the DeNiro character's tragic, love-lorn younger brother Felipe.But it's the Columbian Native Americans recruited to play the Guarani that really steal the show.  They - virtually all untrained actors - are unbelievably good.As a special, added pleasure the legendary Fr. Daniel Berrigan, an actual Jesuit, plays a cameo as one of the Jesuit brothers initially attached to the mission.  He is of course famous - some  would say notorious - for his antiwar and social justice work.Also, the music in this movie is simply gorgeous.  The score is by Ennio Morricone, and is one of the most wonderful I have ever heard. It is a fusion - Song putatively by the native Americans in the movie, accompanied primarily by wind instruments and percussion, in a entrancing, haunting fashion.  I'd recommend buying the soundtrack.The Mission won the Palme d'Or at Cannes and an Academy Award for its cinematography.  It also was nominated for five other Oscars and the Golden Globe for Best Picture.  So even the glitterati liked this film, if that's any recommendation.Finally, the themes of this film are universal, but particularly pertinent to Catholics and others of faith who are called to evangelize the world and succor the poor and disenfranchised.  Questions of the meaning of authority, obedience, justice, mercy, the morality of violence, true faith and charity are all raised and plumbed here, and anyone watching this film will be enlarged for it, I think.

The story line depicts the power struggle between Spain and Portugal which resulted in the line of demarcation in South America.  It portrays how Indian villages were put into slavery as a result of human greed.  It demonstrates the natives and missionaries attempts to resist slavery and destruction of their villages.  While some used passive resistance and a reliance on faith, others used force.  Neither method saved them from the slave traders. Evil prevailed.  Ironically, had the Indians not embraced ""the faith"" they may have been able to fight off the slave traders.The film portrays the struggles that jesuit missionaries endured to foster the faith that ultimately let them down.

Menges captured Oscar gold but it eluded the maestro losing to the score for ""Round Midnight"".  Their collective contributions not only serves the film but acts as a Greek chorus to the action on screen.  The film's critics gave grudging respect to their work but dismissed other aspects of the film.  Most notably their barbs were directed at Robert Bolt's script stating that there was a predictability to it and a certain inevitability to the film's conclusion.  The response to that would be there is a basis in history here and it doesn't always end the way we like it.  I think their missing the point in that the missionary work of the Jesuit priests on the surface may appear to be doomed but their actions live on in the hearts of the natives most notably the youngest.  This is a difficult sell to challenge your audience this way and kudos should go out to both Bolt and director Roland Joffee for tackling such ambitious material.  The film is anchored by terrific performances by Jeremy Irons as Father Gabriel who practices reason and nonviolence to persuade the Spanish and Portuguese colonists not to dismantle the Mission and Robert DeNiro as Rodrigo a mercenary turned Jesuit priest who feels agression should be met with agression.  Most impressive is Ray McAnally as the Pope's emissary sent to mediate the dispute but with a heavy heart must side with the colonists because of the internal politics in Europe.

Unfortunately the film opened to disappointing business in the U.S. but did much better in Europe (It received a Golden Palm at Cannes).  DeNiro and Irons each give excellent performances of 2 men caught in conflict over the problems of church vs state in the colonization of the tribes in the Americas.  Many people thought this to be a religious film but it is far more than that. Rather to divulge a lot about the plot, I would rather imply that this film is a triumph in the sense that it is action filled spectacle that makes us think rather than just entertain us. It's too bad that director Roland Joffe has descended nowadays to doing a slasher film with an American actress (Elisha Cuthbert).  Anyway do see this film for the direction, the stars and of course, the evocative score by Ennio Morricone who should've won the Oscar that year.

Ironically the church has the mission to bring theodicy to the world and it does this through the message of God's Love and Forgiveness.  It tries to accomplish this through the sending out of missionaries, in this case the Jesuit priests, to tell the story and bring others to the knowledge of God's Love and Forgiveness.  Tragically politics and greed for power in the hierarchy of the church (in this case the Roman Catholic Church) brings about a situation where the people of God are killed supposedly in the name of God.  This story opens and ends with Cardinal Altamirano (Ray McAnally) dictating a letter to the Pope informing him of the events that had transpired after giving church missions in South America over to the Spaniards and Portuguese.  The nature of the setting is beautiful.  Views of the waterfalls are breath-taking and spectacular.The message of theodicy is played out in the story involving two main characters Father Gabriel (Jeremy Irons) and Rodrigo Mendoza (Robert De Niro).  Father Gabriel brings theocracy to the Natives of South America.  At the beginning of our story Rodrigo is a slave trader who undergoes a traumatic conversion experience and serves those whom he had sold into slavery before.  His story of transformation is one of heartache, murder, repentance and extreme penance which he imposes upon himself.  It is the forgiveness and acceptance of those who he former hunted that sets him feel to serve both God and the Natives.  Another film that shows a similar vein of acceptance after tragedy is the classic movie Hawaii (1966) based on James Michener. Rev. Hale accepts the Native Hawaiians as he begins to mellow in the aftermath of his losses.  In Rodrigo's case is his acceptance by the tribe that helps them to fight against the imposed theocracy of the Cardinal later on.At issue here, in spite of the beautifully portrayal of conversion to Christianity of the Native people of South America, is the imposed will of governing forces of politics around greed ownership of land.  Yet this was done under the auspices of the Church as God's Will, which is called theocracy.  The people of the land had no say, they were the conquered, to be exploited and were considered as chattel, for them there was not theodicy.  Their willingness to share and work for the common good of all, even though a principle of Christianity was considered a threat to the economy of others with political clout.  Because they would not give up that which they had worked for, they were condemned to death.  When Cardinal Atlamirno orders them to leave the Mission; they wanted to know why?  His answer was that they had to submit to the will of God.  Their answer was had God changed his mind?  They were doing what they had been taught was God's will for them.

Robert Deniro delivers a his usual high-quality job, and the venerable Liam Neason rounds out a high-octane cast.  In addition, Aidan Quinn stands out in a small but important role.I dare say that this production was well worth all of the hoopla afforded it by the Cannes film festival.

237325,A20S5EZEYNET9R,630027120X,Edward Turner,"[3, 6]","Often dismissed as a removed and ineffective, wannabe epic, The Mission is in reality a moving and tragic story that has much to say about the hypocrisy of the church and the brutality of the progress of ""civilised""  society. Irons plays a Jesuit priest who converts a remote tribe of Indians  in South America only for greedy merchants and fractions with the church to  threaten the mission. It is true that for the first hour and a half the  film is oddly removed as Bolt's screenplay and director Joff&eacute; treat the  story at arm's length, as if the audience is merely an observer to the  unfolding events. The result is interesting rather than stimulating and  some people may start fidgeting half way in. But the film's climax in last  half-hour is powerful and deeply rewarding of all that has gone before. De  Niro is somewhat detached in his performance as a former mercenary and  slave trader, converted to the Jesuit faith but Irons is brilliant and  holds the film superbly with a dignified an sincere performance. The  Mission is also an endlessly beautiful film thanks to Chris Menges'  breathtaking photography as well as impeccable production design that  conveys a real sense of period and setting.

Images appear crisp and damage-free, with deep blacks in contrast to the coursing whites of the waterfalls and the nitrogen-rich greens.Sound has been remixed into Dolby Digital 5.1.  The mix keeps most of the action in the front speakers, with too few atmospherics finding their way to the rear. Screenwriting master Robert Bolt's dialogue comes across loud and clear above the roar of the river. As good as this transfer is, those who remember the dazzling theatrical presentation may come away somewhat disappointed. &quot;The Mission's&quot; natural habitat is the big screen.Joffe tells the tale of making &quot;The Mission&quot; in a commentary that is at least as interesting as the film itself. Disc 2 features a fascinating -- but flat and grainy -- BBC documentary about the production and the Waunana Indians who acted in the movie. (No other extras appear on the second disc, apparently added solely to preserve the quality of the film on disc 1).

237332,A2C7BOQVFH1HLE,630027120X,Frederick Baptist,"[4, 4]","This movie moved me (no pun intended) on a number of levels as its theme of hypocrisy, greed, betrayal and the inhumanity and cruelty of man hits home hard and yet I couldn't help but feel that it was a little too short at just a little over 2 hours long.  Perhaps this film too was a victim of commercial factors and that it was edited to this time frame but if ever a film would be better off for being longer it would have to be this one.I felt the characters didn't have time to develop enough and that this fine wine didn't get to breathe before we were forced to drink it.  I felt DeNiro's story at the beginning and his character could have benefitted from some development and I would have liked to have seen more of the everyday life of the tribe and their spiritual development.For this reason, I hope a good Director's Cut Blu-ray version is released soon as this movie if given the chance to slowly unravel has the potential to be at least as good as ""Lawrence of Arabia"".  This doesn't mean that this is a bad film in any way but it certainly could have been at least a little bit better.  In fact it is a testimony to how good this film is in that I'm actually asking for it to be at least 3 hours long instead of wishing the running length to be shorter as I do for many other films.As someone from Portuguese/Asian descent who is also Catholic; this film moved me greatly as it reminded me of how imperfect some of my ancestors both of descent and of faith were and I was actually very sad by many of the scenes.  The fact that Portugal still allowed slavery even after Spain ""abolished"" it sickens me and the fact that the Church had so little faith in their beliefs to engage tragically in the politics of the time to totally pervert Christ's teachings leaves me also with great disappointment.The Cardinal's inexplicable decision to not protect the innocent and Christ's little innocent ones from effectively what became Satan's minions showed his great lack of faith in the very religion he professes to follow.  His misplaced concern that the Jesuits would be wiped out of existance as being a worthy reason to commit a gross sin of omission and allow genocide for greed sickened me.  If it was God's will to protect the Jesuits, nothing would have threatened them and all they needed to do was to do the simple command of Jesus to go forth and spread the Gospel to the ends of the earth.  Jeremy Irons does this to the bitter end and hence imitates Christ the best while everyone else ironically does the opposite and does Satan's work in the name of Christ.  I found the scene where even the Blessed Sacrament is shot at to be the most touching as ""followers"" of Christ actually shoot at Him.  This film will stay with me for a long time as I ponder the many aspects over time.This dvd is very well put together as well as I really like the mostly cardboard packaging and the bonus dvd is a real treat describing the making of the film as well as highlighting how natives in South America are still being abused and exploited to this day.  The picture quality is very good and so is the sound quality although I would repeat that a longer, Director's Cut version restored both picture and sound-wise in Blu-ray would be a real treat.  With the 25th anniversary of the film due in a couple of years time, this would be a good opportunity to do such a project.I wait with bated breath!Recommended!",4,Great Movie That Moved Me Personally!

237337,A1YTR8FI6UPMA6,630027120X,Get Serious,"[1, 6]","This film recounts a supposedly 'true story'. Jesuits bringing the 'word of God' to South American Indians (savages) are exterminated by commercial interests of the Portuguese out to enslave and murder Indigenous populations for slavery and commercial land interests i.e. 'colonialism.' The Jesuits or the Society of Jesus were incepted in the sixteenth century in Europe and obtained approval by the Catholic Pope in 1540, therefore ARE a Catholic force (and still exist today). The Vatican had several 'levels' of devout soldiers sent around the world to propagandize the masses. The Jesuits were the bottom rung, swearing oaths of poverty and living in squalor with the Indigents they were trying to 'save' (Can you say Peace Corps?). The Catholic Church or 'The Church' often stated that they were the 'representation of God on Earth.' Amazing...that God appeared here and face-to-face with the Pope granted The Church this incredible status! It was never even in the news! There after, the Church got a lot of mileage out of the phrase...""God wills it!"" And that created over two thousand years of torture and death of millions by a group of homosexual child molesters! It is interesting(as portrayed in this film) that the Jesuits consider 'saving' Indigents to be teaching them how to sing arias and play the violin, while absorbing Catholic propaganda...wouldn't want them to learn any survival or agronomy skills!The Portuguese are portrayed as evil, which they were. The Spanish, Portuguese and Italian Scourges (and let's not forget the Vatican) ravaged the Lower Americas; raping, enslaving and murdering Indigents for four hundred years and stealing all their gold, silver, gems and minerals...ah Colonialism at its finest! The film portrays the Jesuits as trying to defend the Indigents against the encroaching army of the Portuguese, overwhelmed by European firepower. In history the group with the most advanced and most number of killing hardware usually wins against bows and arrows. In this film we are to side with the Jesuits in their impossible task, even though you  have to ask yourself...which is worse...toxic propaganda or physical enslavement...they're both the same!

It came at a fragile and life changing moment in my life and for some seven nights I walked several miles back and forth in a bitter winter to see it at the once splendid Ontario Theatre in Washington, DC. The film was Roland Joff&eacute;'s epic ""The Mission"" with the unlikely cast of Jeremy Irons, Robert DeNiro, Liam Neeson and Ray McNally. When I first saw it I thought it to be amongst the most beautiful films I'd ever seen, and nearly 25 years later, think so still. While nominated and winning many international awards, The Mission was mostly ignored by Hollywood, receiving only one Oscar (cinematography).The complexities of the story telling in ""The Mission"" are almost too much to take in in a single film lasting a bit more than two hours, but Jaffe has woven them together with a touch that is both delicate and profound, creating a tapestry as impressive and intricate as any medieval Flemish tapastry, its story held together flawlessly.While supposedly created for our own preservation and edification, politics and religion have done as much or more unspeakable horrors in the names of God and Man as they have good and in ""The Mission"" we see the bloody result, despite the effort of a few rebel priests who believe in the power of love and the natives with whom they try to share their world. The villains are plentiful in this ""true tale"" and Joffe never disguises them, allowing the deceptive simplicities of ""good versus evil"" run its predictable course, as they twist and turn everything they touch into the inevitable choked and knotted apocalypse of sorrow that is always the end result of greed.Despite its bleak, often hopeless nature, Joffe nonetheless gives us a miracle: a film of such ineffable beauty that stirs both heart and mind through the combination of remarkable acting, a wilderness captured in breathtaking cinematography, battles both physical and spiritual, and wed it all to one of the most remarkable musical scores of the late 20th century.",5,One of the most potent and powerful films then - and still,1277856000,"06 30, 2010",2010,2131,"['just', 'finished', 'watching', 'movie', 'when', 'first', 'saw', '1986', 'made', 'impression', 'could', 'think', 'nothing', 'else', 'days', 'came', 'fragile', 'life', 'changing', 'moment', 'life', 'seven', 'nights', 'walked', 'several', 'miles', 'back', 'forth', 'bitter', 'winter', 'see', 'once', 'splendid', 'Ontario', 'Theatre', 'Washington', 'DC', 'film', 'was', 'Roland', 'Joff', 'eacute', 'epic', 'Mission', 'unlikely', 'cast', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'Ray', 'McNally', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'thought', 'be', 'amongst', 'most', 'beautiful', 'films', ""'d"", 'ever', 'seen', 'nearly', '25', 'years', 'later', 'think', 'so', 'still', 'nominated', 'winning', 'many', 'international', 'awards', 'Mission', 'was', 'mostly', 'ignored', 'Hollywood', 'receiving', 'only', 'one', 'Oscar', 'cinematography', '.The', 'complexities', 'story', 'telling', 'Mission', 'are', 'almost', 'too', 'much', 'take', 'single', 'film', 'lasting', 'bit', 'more', 'two', 'hours', 'Jaffe', 'woven', 'together', 'touch', 'delicate', 'profound', 'creating', 'tapestry', 'impressive', 'intricate', 'medieval', 'Flemish', 'tapastry', 'story', 'held', 'together', 'flawlessly.While', 'supposedly', 'created', 'own', 'preservation', 'edification', 'politics', 'religion', 'have', 'done', 'as', 'much', 'more', 'unspeakable', 'horrors', 'names', 'God', 'Man', 'have', 'good', 'Mission', 'see', 'bloody', 'result', 'effort', 'few', 'rebel', 'priests', 'who', 'believe', 'power', 'love', 'natives', 'whom', 'try', 'share', 'world', 'villains', 'are', 'plentiful', 'true', 'tale', 'Joffe', 'never', 'allowing', 'deceptive', 'simplicities', 'good', 'versus', 'evil', 'run', 'predictable', 'course', 'twist', 'turn', 'everything', 'touch', 'inevitable', 'choked', 'knotted', 'apocalypse', 'sorrow', 'always', 'end', 'result', 'greed.Despite', 'bleak', 'often', 'hopeless', 'nature', 'Joffe', 'nonetheless', 'miracle', 'film', 'such', 'ineffable', 'beauty', 'heart', 'mind', 'combination', 'remarkable', 'acting', 'wilderness', 'captured', 'breathtaking', 'cinematography', 'physical', 'spiritual', 'wed', 'one', 'most', 'remarkable', 'musical', 'scores', 'late', '20th', 'century']",N/A

I also expected that the plight and customs of the natives would be more expanded upon to explain much of the movies activities. Far too much of what went on in this movie was left to the viewers interpretation of the events and situations.DeNero & Irons characters were never fully developed. In the beginning of the movie these two were on opposite sides of the native slavery situation and later DeNero became a priest and advocate of the natives. Unfortunately, the background of the characters was never explained in any depth. Liam Neesome's role could have been phoned in due to a lack of any serious dialog for his character. Very disappointing.I have a rule that when I begin to watch a movie I watch it all of the way through unless the movie is so horrible that I can't stand to watch it through to the end. The first time I tried to watch this movie it put me to sleep. The next time I tried to watch it a couple of days later I found myself wishing that I could have fallen asleep again.Bottom Line, this is a borderline movie for me. It is watchable more for the scenery and period costumes than for the content of the movie. I know that this film will never make it into my DVD collection. Chalk one up again for Amazon Prime.

237349,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,630027120X,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[1, 2]","A film that comes from so far away 22 years ago that the story, or the history, of the film is no longer important, but was it important even in 1986? Today the struggle between the two Christian kings of Portugal and of Spain on one hand, though hostile to each other when the other party is absent, and the church on the other hand, a church that is also divided between the European hierarchy that only sees the survival they have to go through in Europe by defending there their interests by sacrificing a few missions in South America. Today these details are irrelevant  The Christian church or churches have long abandoned this kind of policy, particularly the Catholic church. But today the general pattern of the story, the massacre, the slaughter, the slaying of a whole Indian, local population to the sole interest of the colonial powers who try to put their hands on the riches and resources of some foreign countries, like oil in Iraq for instance is quite a familiar story. And what about that American war hero who became an American war hero in a war that killed several million people and devastated a whole country for the sole political and economic interests of one country, one country alone. Who cares in the west about the local indigenous population that gets killed by western bullets? Like The Sons of The Pioneers used to sing, ""Lie Low, Little Doggies, Lie Low on the Ground"". We are living in a world that stands upside down in two ways. It is still standing upside down if we consider normal human ethics that tells us to help the poor and the weak and to respect the goods and property of other people, particularly their national territory. And yet that world that is upside down is in the process of tilting over and then getting upside down a second time, which might bring it upside up and downside down. The champion of deregulated free market jungle economy is nationalizing most of the American banking system and is getting ready to do the same with the car industry that has been playing with bankruptcy for quite a few years now. Less state he says the candidate of the party of this president. Yet this president nationalizes all that is getting into difficult straits by their own fault, but he does not forget that public money is the property of the rich since they did not contribute much and he is trying to give them a financial bonanza for their dumb incompetence. You see the pattern. That pattern that is still alive like hell and kicking like a dumb mule. Don't worry, as usual, before the world gets back to upright many people will be killed and will die. Before Brazil got a president that is starting the reversal of that historical injustice and mistake of 1750, quite a few millions were killed or enslaved or tortured or assassinated or whatever provided death was the end of it. But this film gives you another element of that pattern. The powerful who plan to genocide you manage to present the whole matter in such a way that you have to agree to foot the bill which will hurt you or otherwise the depression that would ensue would not only hurt, it would bring humanity a few hundred million individuals down, lower and shorter. And in the back of their heads they believe that this is sustainable since for at least twenty or thirty years the overpopulation of the world will be slowed down. As these vultures would say: there is always a positive point in any negative event. But the more I try to think positively the more I stand on the side of all these priests, these Jesuits, those who fought and died fighting and those who did not fight and died trying to bring God's word down on earth. The only thing that came for all of them was bullets, bullets and more bullets. Is that pattern human, historical, or plain characteristic of one particular period?

From the opening sequence with the crucified Jesuit being placed in the slow moving river only to be caught up in the rapids and then over a spectacular waterfall - STUNNING - you are transported to a very magical and dangerous time.  Roland Joffe films on location in the amazon basin and captures the feel of the jungle.  Joffe tries to capture the redemption of man and his service to others.  First there is Jeremy Irons coming to grips with himself being the one who had sent the previous missionary that met with the fate of crucifixion and the withdrawl of support from the papacy; and there is Robert De Niro's character - a slave trader that murders his brother in a jealous rage only to later repent and become a Jesuit himself. Rodrigo's (De Niro) penance begins with him dragging all of his weaponary and armor with him through rivers and up mountains and sheer cliffs - a breathtaking sequence.  When he is forgiven by the very natives that he had previously killed and enslaved, you feel your own tears flowing with his.This film is fairly accurate in a historical sense - and really captures the zeal that the early members of The Society of Jesus (Jeusuits) had for spreading the gospel and &quot;civilization&quot;.  The aspects of the wealthy power brokers working with the papacy to try to rid the New World of the missionaries is very accurate.  All in all a wonderful movie - one that I never tire of watching.  Other movies in this same vein include Black Robe (A Jesuit in Quebec) and the often overlooked At Play in the Fields of the Lord - which is a wonderful adaption of the novel - another must read is the late Fr. Malachi Martin's book The Jesuits - it provides additional background information behind this movie.

If you just read a brief description that it's about the troubles of Jesuit missionaries in South America in the 18th century, you will NOT get the idea!First off, it may not sound very dramatic: well, that gets sorted out pretty quick at the beginning, with the launch of the crucified man to his death down the turbulent river and over the huge thundering waterfall, and then the intrepid priest struggling up sheer water-soaked rocks above a drop of hundreds of feet...And his first encounter with the painted and arrow-bearing tribe - wonderful.But as the movie progresses, and the Jesuits build their jungle mission, and the unspeakable Don Cabeza reminds us how truly horrible colonial expansion could be, we are plunged into a maelstrom of good and evil. It's the world as we would love it to be and occasionally glimpse it, based on love and integrity, versus the world as it is...or, as the Cardinal says at the end, how we have made it. Greed and power versus simple naked humanity.. guess who wins.Although the Jesuits are presented as the ""good guys"" here, there is a point where the Cardinal (I think it's him) acknowledges that the Indians would have been happier and better off if the sea and winds had not brought ANY of the white race to their shores - which is pretty much true of North America as well.As I say, a beautiful but not cheering movie. The director's commentary is worth hearing - he actually sought out one of the few hardly-contacted tribes and involved them in this movie. Was that a good thing? who knows. An intriguing sidelight is his mention that they took some members of the tribe to London and New York.  After a while the tribe said they wanted to go home. In our cities, they respected our skill with stone, but there was far too much of it: they liked their own skills with the living world, the plants and animals.

They tend to be preachy dry affairs starring Kirk Cameron as a man who is addicted to online porn, until he finds God and smashes the evil computer with a baseball bat because apparently he has joined the Taliban or something. Most 'Christain' films are designed simply reinforce the prejudices of a limited choir.Critically acclaimed 'serious' films are also often fairly dry affairs, interested more in being 'good ' rather than being entertaining. They tend to beat a visual and narrative dead horse rather than entertain for the sake of entertaining.The Mission is a critically acclaimed movie about faith... and I loved it.I had avoided the film for twenty years as if it was an 'A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius'. It turns out to be a dynamic, action packed affair, starring Robert De Niro, Jeremy Irons and a very young Liam Neelson.It is a movie about faith. In fact, it is one of the most moving and effect movies about the purpose of faith and redemption I have ever seen. It is also about the historical pact between Spain and Portugal (Treaty of Madrid) and the war on both the natives of the jungle and the powerful Jesuits who protect them.The movie is told in flashback with a Papal emissary (the excellent Ray McAnally) telling the tale and his tragic role in shaping it. The visuals are often simply amazing and the score by Ennio Morricone is considered one of the best of all time. Some critics felt the war scenes at the end muddled but I feel this reflects on the nature of battle and at the very least, this viewer had no trouble following it.One side note the film contains a lot of nudity including some rather shocking child nudity. Since the film is rated PG, one must assume the ratings board used the National Geographic rules in their assessment.There I go praising the film no doubt scaring off viewers that are afraid it will be 'good.'

The story is very human, and while some reviewers think this picture is a critique of faith, particularly the Catholic Church, I do not agree. Yes colonialism had its problems and was a flawed vehicle for the Gospel, but the Indians came to beautiful faith genuinely. Also the priests had an abiding love for these Indians as people, not as mere numbers to add to their scrolls. Real faith is not something which can be forced. And in the end of the movie the Indians and priests give one of the most compelling and loving scenes of martyrdom I have ever witnessed on film. Yes it is sad how they are cut down, but they gain far more than they lose, and in doing so show that true faith cannot be destroyed. I should state that I'm a Protestant, but I have known priests, and the character Jeremy Irons plays reminds me of several dear priests I've encountered. DeNiro gave probably the best performance of his career in this film, the only other contender would be ""Deer Hunter"". The scene when they reach the top of the mountain and the Indian cuts off the dead weight of the armor (symbolic of the guilt and anguish he'd be carrying over his brother's death) and DeNiro breaks down and expresses sorrow and finally joy it is truly sublime! Ennio Morricone's music beautifully complements the film (both in pacing and detail) and shows his preeminence amongst film composers! I should also comment on the film's lush cinematography.

I was attracted to both on DVD years ago because of their incredible cast list, and was amazed to find both are among the finest films released that decade. ""The Mission"" stars Robert De Niro, Jeremy Irons, and Liam Neeson in a deeply compelling and visually stunning tale of a Jesuit missionary trying to indoctrinate natives in South America during the mid-1700s. A detailed synopsis can be found elsewhere, so for the purposes of brevity I'm going to focus on the transfer and special features.Only mere moments into the film I was already impressed with the gorgeous transfer. I've watched the DVD recently and this is a significant upgrade in terms of image quality. Fine detail is overall excellent and the colors are much more vibrant. Quite simply, it both looks and sounds absolutely wonderful. With certain catalog titles I've found that the Blu doesn't offer the ""best possible quality"", but rather the ""best available quality"", for various reasons. In the case of ""The Mission"", I feel we are truly presented with the best possible quality. I didn't notice any blatant instances of artificial enhancement or otherwise distracting errors during the film. I'd give the transfer an easy 4.5 out of 5.The back of the case indicates that all of the features from the DVD have been ported over to the Blu, which includes: a commentary track by director Roland Joffe, the hour-long vintage documentary ""Omnibus"", and the theatrical trailer. Joffe's commentary is par for the course, he makes some curious observations and tells some interesting anecdotes. The ""Omnibus"" documentary is fascinating and nice to see here, but it is unfortunately presented in standard definition and it's looking seriously rough. As in, old VHS tape rough. Still, it's well worth watching, because it functions not just as a making-of piece but provides insight into how the film crew interacted with the Waunana Indians. Unfortunately, I simply could not locate the theatrical trailer on the disc.It would've been nice to have seen a contemporary piece on the film, much like the one the ""Last of the Mohicans"" Blu-Ray received, but this is something of a niche title and so the exclusion of such is understandable. In summation, the image quality of the documentary is lamentable, and they either forgot to include or maliciously hid the theatrical trailer, but the film itself looks crystal clear beautiful. In the end, that's why you're interested in this disc to begin with.

Whether they be his brothers in the faith, the Indians he taught, or Rodrigo, the lost one that he attempts to guide.This movie is very powerful in demonstrating the contrast between the positive aspects of mankind and the negative ones. The locations are beautiful, the story moving. The conclusion of this piece may give some pause. It certainly got me thinking and I appreciate that very much.Seeing Liam Neeson in a minor supporting part here was a true pleasure. I found it nice to actually see Neeson and Irons working together (especially since they are 2 of my favorite UK actors). Whereas in Kingdom of Heaven, Liam and Jeremy both appear in the film but not together.Main themes are: working past anger, forgiveness, love, conviction, and justice vs.injustice.",5,Inspirational!,1285977600,"10 2, 2010",2010,1214,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'exploring', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'work', 'year', 'now', 'Mission', 'one', 'movies', 'newest', 'viewer', 'being', 'released', 'when', 'was', '4', 'think', 'Irons', 'fine', 'actor', 'often', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'type', 'men', 'Mission', '*positive*', 'glaring', 'exception', 'Father', 'Gabriel', 'wonderful', 'man', 'peace', 'faith', 'nonviolence', 'yet', 'was', 'also', 'just', 'leader', 'led', 'example', 'Gabriel', 'also', 'people', 'be', 'brothers', 'faith', 'Indians', 'taught', 'Rodrigo', 'lost', 'one', 'guide.This', 'movie', 'very', 'powerful', 'demonstrating', 'contrast', 'positive', 'aspects', 'mankind', 'negative', 'ones', 'locations', 'are', 'beautiful', 'story', 'moving', 'conclusion', 'piece', 'may', 'give', 'pause', 'certainly', 'got', 'thinking', 'appreciate', 'very', 'much.Seeing', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'minor', 'supporting', 'part', 'here', 'was', 'true', 'pleasure', 'found', 'nice', 'actually', 'see', 'Neeson', 'Irons', 'working', 'together', 'especially', 'are', '2', 'favorite', 'UK', 'actors', 'Whereas', 'Kingdom', 'Heaven', 'Liam', 'Jeremy', 'appear', 'film', 'not', 'together.Main', 'themes', 'are', 'working', 'anger', 'forgiveness', 'love', 'conviction', 'justice', 'vs.injustice']",N/A

Everything appears to be set in the correct time period. And does a very vivid job portraying of the Eighteenth Centaury in the Amazon Jungle.Jeremy Irons plays a Spanish Jesuit who goes into the South American wilderness to build a mission in the hope of converting the Indians of the region to the Catholic Religion. He professes Christ's love and does not believe in violence. Robert DeNiro plays a slave hunter who is converted and joins Irons in his mission.The Jesuits are successful in getting the natives out of the jungles and into what become very successfully ran Missions. At this time Spain does not allow slavery, but Portugal does. And a Cardinal is sent to the region to determine whether or not the Jesuit Missions should stay under the protection of the Church or be given over to the Portuguese; which would men slavery or death for the natives.Of course we see what great work has been accomplished in these missions as the Cardinal tours them. And he knows that these missions are not only God's work. But an exemplary model of what we should all strive for. There is a great moment in the movie when the cardinal is in the Mission Church deciding if he should follow God's will or do that which would be best for the Church in Europe.We will be shown both those who follow God's will and those who follow the desire and greed of men. As another reviewer has said here, the themes of this film are universal, but particularly pertinent to Catholics and others of faith who are called to evangelize the world and succor the poor and disenfranchised. Questions of the meaning of authority, obedience, justice, mercy, the morality of violence, true faith and charity are all raised and plumbed here, and anyone watching this film will be enlarged for it, I think.This is a must watch film...and you will want to see it more then once.

237396,AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,630027120X,"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner""","[3, 16]","When it comes to three talented performers as Robert De Niro, Jeremy Irons, and Liam Neeson, each one of us has a specific film role or feature film they have been in that comes automatically to our minds when we hear their names. For De Niro, he has benefited quite profitably from teaming up with director Martin Scorsese decades ago in Raging Bull and Taxi Driver, among others, as well as appearing in the Godfather series, the politically controversial Wag the Dog, and The Deer Hunter. Jeremy Irons is probably best known for his villainous voice role in The Lion King and his role opposite Bruce Willis in Die Hard with a Vengeance. And Liam Neeson's star has risen in part to critical praise of his roles in Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List and Kinsey, as well as more mainstream hits as Star Wars: Episode I and Love Actually. But few would even fathom remembering the film of which all three of these actors share in common - The Mission.The story for The Mission adheres presently to the historical events of the era and actions that would have taken place during the mid-1700s, specifically around the year 1750 CE, but in doing so the interests of its audience are alienated. Be it either from an unwillingness to take creative chances with the storyline or the lack of serious character development amongst the lead roles, The Mission more often then not bores its public into submission. Unless you happen to be genuinely invested within the time period in which this film is set against then it will be quite difficult to remain concerned for the outcome of the events onscreen. But the purpose of The Mission far exceeds the level of merely expressing to its audience the heart-wrenching tale of the turbulent changes taking root amongst the native Indian populations of Latin America during the mid-1700s but instead uses allegory to connect to after effects caused by the Treaty of Madrid of 1750 and the political turmoil within the same region in the 1980s, something that would hit home with its target audience. In reference back to the historical records of the time, in the year 1750 AD the countries of Spain and Portugal came to an accord in which they signed a document called the Treat of Madrid. The agreement allowed Spain to retain all territory west of modern-day Uruguay and Portugal kept the Amazon, Mato Grosso, Goias, and Rio Grande do Sul.Robert De Niro's engaging and captivating performance as Rodrigo Mendoza, the former mercenary searching through redemption in the tropical missionary built by the Jesuit order, has to certainly be one of the most surprising and magnificent roles of his exhaustive film career. Glancing back toward Robert De Niro's promising career during the 1980s sincerely demonstrates how far the enduring talent has fallen over the years with roles in such horrid features as Godsend and Hide & Seek. The struggle for the film's audience is that they are directed emotionally to be supportive or sympathetic toward Rodrigo, especially near the end of the film, but clearly do not understand as to why they should feel this way. Seeing as how Rodrigo never expresses exactly, either to himself or to others within the Jesuit order, as to what he true feelings or intentions are toward a particular course of action, it is quite understandable as to why this would an inconvenience to the audience's way of thinking. The lack of character of development, which truthfully is not limited merely to De Niro's character, leaves far too many question unanswered. Beyond being merely family-related, why does Rodrigo feels as horrible as he does about killing his brother having been a mercenary most of his adult life, and thus having inflicted such brutal punishment, or worse, on a regular basis? Why does he agree to Father Gabriel's act of penance to begin with? What reason does he have for joining the Jesuit order? If for spiritual purposes then why does he withdraw back to his former way in the end, be it though for a better cause and purpose.Jeremy Irons' Father Gabriel is constructed in almost the exact same fashion as De Niro's Rodrigo in that the assumptions made of the character's actions are left pretty opened ended, which does not benefit the audience's understanding the film's spiritual message. In any event though, Irons' solid performance is positively convincing and connects with the film's audience more thoroughly then any other role, a statement truly deserving of praise. But if there was choice as to which character in the film should have been cut from the final reel it would undoubtedly be Liam Neeson's Fielding, a member of the Jesuit missionary order. The dilemma with his character is that he serves no actual purpose, at least none that has any lasting effects on the proceedings of the rest of the film, and contributes little if anything to The Mission's overall thematic atmosphere. Beyond a few albeit brief appearances in the two-hour feature, the role of Fielding should have been designated as nothing more then a mere cameo for Neeson rather then a supporting role as it does nothing of the sort.The Mission's musical composition, scored and conducted by Ennio Morricone, is truly a sight to be seen, or in this case heard, as it is truly difficult to categorize accurately unless it has been experienced personally. It ranges from purely elevated grandeur, flowing majestically as the swift guided strokes of the native Indian oarsmen convey the Cardinal through the Amazonian jungle to their mission-village, only to dabble into fits of the hysterically, unintentionally of course, awful. There should be no rational excuse for Morricone to have done this seeing as how it goes about distracting the audience from the course of the film, reoccurring every so often out of nowhere that no one can help but be confused when they hear it.Despite benefiting exceedingly from a well-intentioned, if not an often disconcerted, storyline and proverbial sequences of dialogue, the pacing of the film seems rather off, convincing the audience that it is longer then its actual two hour and fifteen minute time length should suggest. Furthermore, The Mission's numerous obscure, and ultimately unnecessary, uses of particular sequences or character actions should have never found their way into the final version of the film. For example, what was with the little native Indian child tag along after Rodrigo? What particular purpose did he serve within the storyline that the other children did not? And was anyone else confused, or surprised, when his laughter sounded like Alvin and the Chipmunks? This might have more to say about the rather primitive sound innovations, from the modern perspective, of cinema within the 1980s then anything else but still it could have been dealt with differently then it was. And then there was the scene in which, as the Jesuit missionaries paddle their way toward the missionary village, a random tree along the river collapses into the water and then Irons makes a passing comment about it before quickly moving on. Was this truly necessary? The audience may receive somewhat of a chuckle from it but for obviously the wrong reasons, if the director had any for its inclusion.Overall, The Mission, be it a historically accurate depiction of the imperialistic plunder of South America within that time period, ultimately makes poor use of its genuine storyline and conventional dialogue pieces in part to its rather melancholy pacing and anti-climatic conclusion. Also, the serious lack of character development, specifically concerning Robert De Niro's Rodrigo Mendoza, prevents the audience from making an emotional investment with the actions occurring onscreen, thus eliminating the mood of excitement or intrigue from the finale. Undoubtedly The Mission is an exceptional piece of little known cinema and should be viewed for its breathtaking cinematography and philosophical exchanges of discussion, but its sloppy editing techniques and lapses in scriptural genius within the screenplay ultimately prevent it from achieving the pinnacle of achievement amongst the movie-going public.",3,The Moose Hole - Misguided

It stars Robert DeNiro and Jeremy Irons and focuses on Britain's involvement in colonizing the tribal indians and then, destroying their homeland.  Not to be missed, this 1986 Cannes Film Festival winner is perhaps both DeNiro and Iron's finest hours on film and the moving, Oscar-winning score will make your skin crawl.Warner Home Video has done a fantastic job on the DVD transfer. Though color and black levels are still a little weak, the picture is, for the most part, nicely balanced, with rich textured hues, excellent contrast levels and incredible detail, even in the remotest background information.  Pixelization is non-existant.  Aliasing and shimmering of fine details is extremely rare.  There was only one instance where edge enhancement was detected and this, for less than 30 sec. of screen time.  The audio is 5.1 remixed and has a nice expanse in the musical score and effects track.  Voices do tend to sound front and center rather than spread across all three channels but, then again, this is a movie from 1986, with all the inherant shortcomings of a soundtrack from that decade factored in.  Background hiss is non-existant.Extras: An audio commentary, theatrical trailer and the absolutely brilliant documentary that revisits the actual sites used in the making-of &quot;The Mission&quot;.BOTTOM LINE: Warner deserves the highest marks for this 2 disc set.

This film has all the individual ingredients of a rousing, heartfelt masterpiece: Ennio Morricone's eponymous, redolent score, Chris Menges' strikingly mounted, symbolically saturated cinematography, Robert Bolt's erudite, literate and high-minded screenplay (apparently penned years earlier as a David Lean project) and a director just off from a round of plaudits for the excellent ""The Killing Fields"". Although the film has a number of isolated merits, the end product is a resolute dissapointment.The opening sequence, a missionary attached to a cross making his way towards oblivion by way of a thunderous waterfall, masterfully segueing into Ennio Morricone's majestic theme; Jeremy Iron's Jesuit priest making his way up that same waterfall; the montage conveying the construction of the mission; the well placed use of Ray MacAnnalay's ambiguously doting, melancholy voice over, amongst others. The irony is that the film's major flaws result from these moments: the constant crescendo of emotional peaks, swelling violins, etc. combined with a narrative which contains such an obvious, inevitable conclusion, underscores most of the film's dramatic power.The ending itself is a mess; it is badly choreographed (the soldier extra's don't seem to know in which direction to point their cannons and guns), with De Niro and Irons (as well as the Indian extra's) temporally confused as if their faculties have  been clouded by langorous jungle narcotics.

Although the acting sometimes seems to lack the emotion it should have, the beautiful cinematography and its individual scenes more than make up for the film's defects.Jeremy Irons plays a peaceful Jesuit missionary who seeks to establish a mission among a tribe of Indians near the falls of Iguacu on the borders of modern Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. At first hostile and suspicious, the natives slowly begin trusting the missionary and some convert. This peaceful setting is soon shattered when Rodrigo Mendoza (Robert De Niro)comes to hunt the natives to meet the demands of a growing slave market. Mendoza later becomes a shattered man upon commiting a cardinal sin and prepares to end his life. Mendoza is soon persuaded by the Jesuit that his salvation is ensured only in the service of God and enrolls himself as a missionary. In penitence, Mendoza arrives to serve the mission housing his Indian victims. In the meantime, the Jesuit order has fallen out of favor with Portugal and Spain's political interests. In an effort to compromise, the Vatican orders the mission dismantled. Fearing that members of his native parish will once again be abducted as slaves once he leaves, the missionary chooses to stand his ground in peaceful defiance. Familiar with the expedient practices of the Portuguese, Mendoza chooses to resist the eviction by force if necessary.The film is shot on location and the viewer is captivated by the pristine beauty of the falls of Iguacu. The roar of the falls and the lush vegetation strengthen the themes of the story. I found the acting to be somewhat uneven however. Jeremy Irons is a little to timid for his role. Although Robert De Niro plays his role quite well as the mercenary, his expressions of rage along with his slips into his NY accent reminded me more of his character in &quot;Taxi Cab&quot;. The director should have also directed his shots more carefully when the story emphasized on emotional/psychological turmoils.This is still a great movie despite some of its flaws and is worthy of being in someone's collection. I strongly recommend it.

Its a genuinely honest film and is not manipulative.It shows the human condition in all its complexity and some of the themes (and, actually, occurances) of the film are not removed to the 18th century.  They are still taking place in the 21st century: the exploitation of world cultures for western economic gain.The religious aspects of the film are even more complex with no easy answers given: all the religious characters have the strengths and frailties that come with religion:  seeking to love humanity while also needing to convert the ""heathen.""  Somtimes the two ideas can come into conflict (although most religious of a certain type don't see this).The most moving--and religious--sequence in the movie (and it still gets me worked up even thinking about it) is at the conclusion of Mendoza's penence.  It is the act of compassion and forgiveness on the part of the Guarani of the man who had been so evil to them that Mendoza truely experiences conversion and which brings about the outpouring of real feeling both in crying and laughing.  It is a deeply religious (and human) experience of love--and the most Christian moment in the film.Did the Guarani show this love and compassion only because of the work of the Jesuits or out of some enherent quality of their society and culture?But that's for another discussion---",4,"Beautiful, Intelligent and disturbing with one of the most moving ""religious"" sequences ever...",1126742400,"09 15, 2005",2005,1455,"['have', 'always', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'deeply', 'moving', 'sometimes', 'irritating', 'not', 'due', 'film-making', 'however', 'genuinely', 'honest', 'film', 'not', 'manipulative.It', 'human', 'condition', 'complexity', 'themes', 'actually', 'occurances', 'film', 'are', 'not', 'removed', '18th', 'century', 'are', 'still', 'taking', 'place', '21st', 'century', 'exploitation', 'world', 'cultures', 'western', 'economic', 'gain.The', 'religious', 'aspects', 'film', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'complex', 'easy', 'answers', 'given', 'religious', 'characters', 'have', 'strengths', 'frailties', 'come', 'religion', 'seeking', 'love', 'humanity', 'also', 'needing', 'convert', 'heathen', 'two', 'ideas', 'can', 'come', 'conflict', 'most', 'religious', 'certain', 'type', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'most', 'moving', 'religious', 'sequence', 'movie', 'still', 'worked', 'up', 'even', 'thinking', 'conclusion', 'Mendoza', 'penence', 'act', 'compassion', 'forgiveness', 'part', 'Guarani', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'so', 'evil', 'Mendoza', 'truely', 'conversion', 'outpouring', 'real', 'feeling', 'crying', 'laughing', 'deeply', 'religious', 'human', 'experience', 'love', 'most', 'Christian', 'moment', 'film.Did', 'Guarani', 'show', 'love', 'compassion', 'only', 'work', 'Jesuits', 'enherent', 'quality', 'society', 'culture', 'discussion']",N/A

I didn't realize that it would take over 20 years before I finally was able to take it in.  It seems to have aged well but, then, most historical epics usually do.  I was overwelmed by the magnitude of the cinematography.  The falls that we revisit often in the film were worth the price of admission.The film tells of an historic event in which Jesuit priests created some missions in an area around Brazil's southeastern border.  The time was around 1750 during which Spanish and Portugese settlements were expanding and civilizing.  The Jesuits expand their missionary work to a remote area as we start following the story.  The underlying motives of the settlers and the priests are in conflict and Rodrigo, Robert DeNiro's character, is a man who switched between the two factions.  We get the general idea as to what will happen.  The same thing always happens in these circumstances.  After a lot of talk and frontier diplomacy, conflict ensues and the film ends with a sense that the next generation will have to regroup further into the jungle.Much of ""The Mission"" was quite compelling.  The dialogue between the priests and the Cardinal was interesting at times and predictible at other times.  I was bothered by the director's failure to consider that the children that had significant roles in this film did not age.  It left the impression that the incredible transformation from ""savage"" to converted and cultured took place in less than a year's time.This is a movie that makes many people mad at ""civilization"".

He ominously warns Gabriel about the futility of building a mission among the Indians, and he seizes several.On his return to &quot;civilization&quot; below the falls (the dusty town stands in marked contrast to the lush greenery above the falls), Rodrigo learns that his beloved Carlotta does not love Rodrigo, but has fallen for Rodrigo's younger brother, Felipe (Aiden Quinn).  Rodrigo, far from a reasonable sort, kills his brother shortly thereafter in a trumped-up quarrel.  Distraught, Rodrigo eventually agrees to do his penance above the falls with Gabriel and his fellow Jesuits (including a young Liam Neeson).Following a tortuous climb above the falls with his lodestone of arms and armor, Rodrigo finds salvation and seeks to become a Jesuit.  The mission above the falls takes shape, and all seems to be right with the world.Of course, this is not to be.  The slavers need their slaves, and they exert enormous pressure against the church -- the Catholic Church is not as strong as it once was, and the militant Jesuits are becoming a nuisance by sapping the supply of slaves (apparently it is too inconvenient to enslave Christians, so the slavers argue that the Indians are monkeys without souls -- nice).Altamirano agrees to visit both the local mission (a gorgeous, mammoth structure complete with farm and Indian priests) as well as the more primitive mission above the falls . . . which is even more impressive despite (and perhaps because of) it's remoteness.But, politics being politics, the missions are doomed and the Indians will be enslaved.  Rodrigo and the younger priests decide to fight, leading to one of the more disturbing battles you will see on-screen.  It's not &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; in its horrors, but it is emotionally wrenching to see the Jesuits and the Indians fight such in such a foregone conclusion.Even more gut-wrenching is Gabriel, who chooses a non-violent response.  In a pitch-perfect performance, Irons emobodies the Jesuit commitment to the simple words of Christ . . . not that it does him or the Indians much good in this world.A haunting spectacle and far from a feel-good movie, &quot;The Mission&quot; deserves full marks for its depiction of a common conflict (Europe versus the New World) in a different setting.  A top-notch cast and a wonderfully shot film make this one for the video library.",5,"Emotionally Wrenching, Enchanting Film",1086566400,"06 7, 2004",2004,3713,"['Not', 'squeamish', 'quot', 'Mission', 'quot', 'duality', 'Europe', 'presence', 'South', 'America', 'salvation', 'brought', 'Jesuits', 'condemnation', 'brought', 'quot', 'civilization.', 'quot', 'Roland', 'Joffe', 'director', 'few', 'punches', 'film', 'dictation', 'letter', 'Pope', 'prominent', 'religious', 'figure', 'Altamirano', 'who', 'just', 'undergone', 'events', 'will', 'transpire', 'film', 'learn', 'events', 'are', 'not', 'pleasant', 'quot', 'local', 'savages', 'are', 'now', 'free', 'be', 'enslaved', 'Holiness', 'quot', 'events', 'quot', 'were', 'brought', 'quot', 'horrifying', 'martyrdom', 'Jesuit', 'priest', 'who', 'had', 'journeyed', 'quot', 'uncivilized', 'quot', 'lands', 'Indians', 'falls', 'what', 'local', 'Indians', 'apparently', 'rejecting', 'Christian', 'teachings', 'crucify', 'toss', 'river', 'river', 'soon', 'falls', 'descending', 'cross', 'one', 'most', 'haunting', 'images', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'film.In', 'response', 'Jesuit', 'priest', 'Gabriel', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'heads', 'falls', 'music', 'score', 'Ennio', 'Morricone', 'quot', 'Good', 'Bad', 'Ugly', 'quot', 'fame', 'win', 'trust', 'locals', 'Soon', 'preaching', 'Word', 'God', 'them.Unfortunately', 'slaver/mercenary', 'Rodrigo', 'Mendoza', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'hunting', 'Indians', 'slavers', 'ominously', 'Gabriel', 'futility', 'building', 'mission', 'Indians', 'several.On', 'return', 'quot', 'civilization', 'quot', 'falls', 'dusty', 'town', 'marked', 'contrast', 'lush', 'greenery', 'falls', 'Rodrigo', 'beloved', 'Carlotta', 'not', 'love', 'Rodrigo', 'fallen', 'Rodrigo', 'younger', 'brother', 'Felipe', 'Aiden', 'Quinn', 'Rodrigo', 'far', 'reasonable', 'sort', 'brother', 'shortly', 'thereafter', 'trumped-up', 'quarrel', 'Distraught', 'Rodrigo', 'eventually', 'do', 'penance', 'falls', 'Gabriel', 'fellow', 'Jesuits', 'including', 'young', 'Liam', 'Neeson', '.Following', 'tortuous', 'climb', 'falls', 'lodestone', 'arms', 'armor', 'Rodrigo', 'salvation', 'become', 'Jesuit', 'mission', 'falls', 'shape', 'be', 'right', 'world.Of', 'course', 'not', 'be', 'slavers', 'need', 'slaves', 'exert', 'enormous', 'pressure', 'church', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'not', 'as', 'strong', 'once', 'was', 'militant', 'Jesuits', 'are', 'becoming', 'nuisance', 'sapping', 'supply', 'slaves', 'apparently', 'too', 'inconvenient', 'enslave', 'Christians', 'slavers', 'argue', 'Indians', 'are', 'monkeys', 'souls', 'nice', '.Altamirano', 'visit', 'local', 'mission', 'gorgeous', 'mammoth', 'structure', 'complete', 'farm', 'Indian', 'priests', 'as', 'well', 'more', 'primitive', 'mission', 'falls', 'even', 'more', 'impressive', 'perhaps', 'remoteness.But', 'politics', 'being', 'politics', 'missions', 'are', 'doomed', 'Indians', 'will', 'be', 'enslaved', 'Rodrigo', 'younger', 'priests', 'decide', 'fight', 'leading', 'one', 'more', 'disturbing', 'battles', 'will', 'see', 'on-screen', 'not', 'quot', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'quot', 'horrors', 'emotionally', 'wrenching', 'see', 'Jesuits', 'Indians', 'fight', 'such', 'such', 'foregone', 'conclusion.Even', 'more', 'gut-wrenching', 'Gabriel', 'who', 'non-violent', 'response', 'pitch-perfect', 'performance', 'Irons', 'Jesuit', 'commitment', 'simple', 'words', 'Christ', 'not', 'Indians', 'much', 'good', 'world.A', 'haunting', 'spectacle', 'far', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'quot', 'Mission', 'quot', 'full', 'marks', 'depiction', 'common', 'conflict', 'Europe', 'New', 'World', 'different', 'setting', 'top-notch', 'cast', 'wonderfully', 'shot', 'film', 'make', 'one', 'video', 'library']",N/A

Irons, who plays a Spanish Jesuit Priest, goes into the wilderness to build a mission, to convert the Indians. DeNiro plays a slaver who eventually joins Irons' mission and serves the native peoples.The main question in this film is that of ownership, and the right to make slaves. The mission begins in Spanish territory that is sold to the Portuguese. The Portuguese do not want to accept that the natives are humans - but at best trained monkeys - and that their Christianity does not protect them from becoming slaves. The Cardinal who came to oversee the decision came with a decision already made, and his inner turmoil, as the narrator, draws the viewer into the political side of the decision and the political side of the church's role in the decision, at that time, in a way that few other films ever have.The film is a cinematographic masterpiece.

Unwittingly like much of my Catholic education it left an indelible impression on me; always for the better. Over the years I have reflected on this movie. On the epic courage of these brave men who trekked into the farthest reaches of the jungles of Latin America to spread Jesus' message. I am simply not that brave.This is a movie that made me feel a great spectrum of emotions. I smiled as I saw Jeremy Iron's character father Gabriel say 'were not the members of a democracy were the members of an order.' I chuckled a bit as those words reminded me of a Brother Maus I had had the privilege of knowing many years ago. I smiled again in one of the opening scenes as I saw the Irish actor Liam Neeson stride across the screen. Yes, I thought there are Jesuits from Ireland trained in Ireland. I like to think that at least some of the Jesuits who defended the indigenous population of South America were Irish.I find it sad as did the Christian Brothers who first showed me this film that the Catholic Church, Gods instrument in this world, failed to protect the indigenous people depicted in this film. High testament to the courage and intellect of the Jesuits is the quote from this movie that 'with an orchestra the Jesuits could have subdued the whole continent.' I find it astonishing that even an SOB like Captain Mendoza can be redeemed. But that was only achieved after father Gabriel asked  Mendoza 'do you have the courage to choose you're penance?'I like to think that those who murdered the indigenous populations of Latin America have been judged in the after life and that those who tried to help and protect them have gone onto their eternal reward. I like to think that had I been alive and a young man with the proper military know how in 1758 that I would have had the intestinal fortitude to defend the native Americans. To paraphrase Jean Larteguy, the author of the novel the Centurions; that is the army in which I would have liked to have fought.Finally, I have a best friend who I have told about this movie. He is a former medivac pilot from our recent wars against terror. He has heard and is responding to Gods call for him to become a preacher and he too hopes to do missionary work in Latin America. He's one of my heroes.

There are many complex themes that are dealt with, but at no point does the film try to say that one way is necessarily the right way.  Yes, it makes it's point very well that killing and/or enslaving people is wrong.  But beyond that, what surprised me is that it takes such a non-judgemental viewpoint of the work of missionaries.  I really appreciated that.In other words, since I'm probably not organizing my thoughts very well, this movie deals with heavy issues but ultimately lets the viewer come to his/her own conclusions.The performances from Jeremy Irons and DeNiro are first class.  If Irons shines brightest, I'd say it's because he has much more screentime and the script gave him a bit more to work with.  But I won't take anything away from DeNiro, this is a really different type of role for him and he is very affective.I could go on, but I think this is a movie that really just needs to be experienced.  And don't be put off by the time period.  I'm not wild about period pieces, generally speaking, but I was engrossed in this movie right from the first scene to the last.  There are some truly unforgettable moments.While I haven't listened to the director's commentary or viewed the documentary (yet), I will say that this is one awesome looking dvd.

Themes of redemption and sacrificial love are at the core of this movie's deep insights into the human person. This film also captures with pitch-perfect sensitivity the Jesuit missionary spirit -- that combination of radical availability, zeal for sharing Christ's love, and willingness to make sacrifices -- that made the Society of Jesus the unshakable and oft-mistrusted bulwark of Catholicism in the post-Reformation era. Several Jesuit priests consulted on the film (including two, Tony Lawn and Daniel Berrigan, who appear as priests in supporting roles in the film itself) and their influence is unmistakable. When you watch this film, there will be no mistaking that this is the religious order of Pope Francis. As Hilaire Belloc once said, if you can hear mass being celebrated in many parts of the world today, it is because the Jesuits gave their lives there. You can feel the spirit of St. Ignatius Loyola lurking behind every frame of this film, moving the viewer to tears of gratitude. This is the rare sort of movie that simultaneously challenges your faith and makes you proud to be a Catholic. From a technical standpoint, the filmmaking may be a bit odd and disjointed in places, but the emotional core of the actors -- along with the astounding visuals and music -- pulls you through and makes everything hold together somehow.

Screenwriter Robert Bolt has an interesting, if obscure story to tell in the violent closure of the 18th Century Jesuit missions in Paraguay as part of a territorial wrangle between Spain and Portugal, with the Vatican going along with genocide to avoid political repercussions in Europe while the priests in the missions try to protect their native Guarani converts from the slave traders simply waiting for the Church to withdraw its protection. Robert Bolt's screenplay is strong, thanks to Chris Menges' cinematography the film looks superb and Ennio Morricone's score is one of his best. Yet the film feels as if something is missing, possibly because it is: the work-in-progress version that won the Palme D'Or at Cannes was reputedly nearly twice as long. What's left tells the story and makes its points, but doesn't really touch the heart or carry you along with more than academic interest. But perhaps worst of all, there's a gaping hole where the heart of The Mission should be in the form of Robert De Niro.He looks the part, learnt fencing, speaks Spanish, yet for all that it's a hollow shell of a performance hiding behind underplayed surface detail. On paper his character is easily the film's most interesting, going from slave-trader to Jesuit missionary only to find himself at odds with his vows when he needs to protect those he used to prey on with force, but De Niro brings nothing to the part in a passive, detached and unemotional performance. His crisis of conscience and road to possible redemption seems no more torturous that trying to decide what to order from a disappointing restaurant menu. Very much a supporting role, if it weren't for his reputation you'd have no idea he's supposed to be the great actor of his generation.By contrast, Jeremy Irons, often a stuffy and mechanical performer, is something of a revelation here, taking the part to heart and abandoning all artifice to give a performance that draws its strength from its genuine humility and humanity. But the film's best performance comes from Ray McAnally as the Papal representative sent ostensibly to judge the matter but in reality to provide a fig leaf for the Church abandoning its converts only to find himself all too aware of the immorality of his actions and tormented by his inability to rebel against them. It's a subtle portrait but a powerful one, and puts a genuinely human face on the film's clash between the ideals of faith and the realities of the way of the world. In many ways it's almost a pity that the film keeps him on the sidelines. (Incidentally, one of the actors playing one of the Jesuit missionaries, Daniel Berrigan, was himself a Jesuit missionary who had been threatened with excommunication, while the Portuguese villain of the piece is played by De Niro's real estate broker!)The 2-disc DVD comes with an excellent one hour documentary about the making of the film from the days when they weren't studio-sanctioned love-ins. Concentrating on the impact on the Waunana extras, much emphasis is placed on the possibly devastating cultural effects their involvement could have, only to be somewhat torpedoed by the telling detail at the end of the program that the entire tribe received only 85,000 for a month-and-a-half's work - apparently rather less than the fencing instructor De Niro insisted be flown in to the location to teach him got if producer David Puttnam's memoirs are to be believed (De Niro fences for a grand total of 30 seconds in the film).Also included are an audio commentary by Joffe and the full theatrical trailer.",3,Heartfelt but unmoving and slightly disappointing,1181260800,"06 8, 2007",2007,3938,"['One', 'trio', 'big-budget', 'films', 'was', 'intended', 'turn', 'Goldcrest', 'major', 'producer', 'run', 'successful', 'mostly', 'low-budget', 'films', 'instead', 'destroyed', 'company', 'Mission', ""n't"", 'irredeemably', 'disastrous', 'Revolution', 'as', 'over-reaching', 'Absolute', 'Beginners', 'still', 'disappointment', 'many', 'admirable', 'qualities', 'Screenwriter', 'Robert', 'Bolt', 'interesting', 'obscure', 'story', 'tell', 'violent', 'closure', '18th', 'Century', 'Jesuit', 'missions', 'Paraguay', 'part', 'territorial', 'wrangle', 'Spain', 'Portugal', 'Vatican', 'going', 'along', 'genocide', 'avoid', 'political', 'repercussions', 'Europe', 'priests', 'missions', 'try', 'protect', 'native', 'Guarani', 'converts', 'slave', 'traders', 'simply', 'waiting', 'Church', 'withdraw', 'protection', 'Robert', 'Bolt', 'screenplay', 'strong', 'thanks', 'Chris', 'Menges', 'cinematography', 'film', 'superb', 'Ennio', 'Morricone', 'score', 'one', 'best', 'film', 'feels', 'something', 'missing', 'possibly', 'work-in-progress', 'version', 'won', 'Palme', ""D'Or"", 'Cannes', 'was', 'reputedly', 'nearly', 'twice', 'long', 'What', 'left', 'story', 'points', ""n't"", 'really', 'touch', 'heart', 'carry', 'more', 'academic', 'interest', 'perhaps', 'worst', 'gaping', 'hole', 'where', 'heart', 'Mission', 'should', 'be', 'form', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro.He', 'part', 'learnt', 'fencing', 'Spanish', 'yet', 'hollow', 'shell', 'performance', 'hiding', 'underplayed', 'surface', 'detail', 'paper', 'character', 'easily', 'film', 'most', 'interesting', 'going', 'slave-trader', 'Jesuit', 'only', 'find', 'odds', 'vows', 'when', 'protect', 'used', 'prey', 'force', 'De', 'Niro', 'nothing', 'part', 'passive', 'detached', 'unemotional', 'performance', 'crisis', 'conscience', 'road', 'possible', 'redemption', 'more', 'torturous', 'trying', 'decide', 'what', 'order', 'disappointing', 'restaurant', 'menu', 'Very', 'much', 'supporting', 'role', 'were', ""n't"", 'reputation', ""'d"", 'have', 'idea', 'supposed', 'be', 'great', 'actor', 'generation.By', 'contrast', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'often', 'stuffy', 'mechanical', 'performer', 'something', 'revelation', 'here', 'taking', 'part', 'heart', 'abandoning', 'artifice', 'give', 'performance', 'strength', 'genuine', 'humility', 'humanity', 'film', 'best', 'performance', 'Ray', 'McAnally', 'Papal', 'representative', 'sent', 'ostensibly', 'judge', 'matter', 'reality', 'provide', 'fig', 'leaf', 'Church', 'abandoning', 'converts', 'only', 'find', 'too', 'aware', 'immorality', 'actions', 'tormented', 'inability', 'rebel', 'subtle', 'portrait', 'powerful', 'one', 'genuinely', 'human', 'face', 'film', 'clash', 'ideals', 'faith', 'realities', 'way', 'world', 'many', 'ways', 'almost', 'pity', 'film', 'sidelines', 'Incidentally', 'one', 'actors', 'playing', 'one', 'Jesuit', 'missionaries', 'Daniel', 'Berrigan', 'was', 'Jesuit', 'missionary', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'threatened', 'excommunication', 'Portuguese', 'villain', 'piece', 'played', 'De', 'Niro', 'real', 'estate', 'broker', '2-disc', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'one', 'hour', 'documentary', 'making', 'film', 'days', 'when', 'were', ""n't"", 'studio-sanctioned', 'love-ins', 'Concentrating', 'impact', 'Waunana', 'extras', 'much', 'emphasis', 'placed', 'possibly', 'devastating', 'cultural', 'effects', 'involvement', 'could', 'have', 'only', 'be', 'somewhat', 'torpedoed', 'telling', 'detail', 'end', 'program', 'entire', 'tribe', 'received', 'only', '85,000', 'month-and-a-half', 'work', 'apparently', 'rather', 'less', 'fencing', 'instructor', 'De', 'Niro', 'insisted', 'be', 'flown', 'location', 'teach', 'got', 'producer', 'David', 'Puttnam', 'memoirs', 'are', 'be', 'believed', 'De', 'Niro', 'fences', 'grand', 'total', '30', 'seconds', 'film', '.Also', 'included', 'are', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Joffe', 'full', 'theatrical', 'trailer']",N/A
