995427,A3S6Z7A6SHC6KR,B000FSME4M,"joseph Corey ""party favors columnist""","[13, 13]","In the third season, Grounded For Life found itself going from Fox to the WB. It was a messed up season in that 3 episodes aired on Fox and 8 on the WB. But this 2 DVD set will contain 13 episodes. So you'll get to see 2 episodes that never aired on either network.There will also be commentary tracks on 6 of the episodes so we'll get the inside tales of what went on during the season the show jumped networks. Lily and Sister Helen will be speaking.Even though ABC Family Channel reruns the show, I enjoy them better on DVD - especially since I don't have to watch 10 minutes of ads to get through each episode. It's a shame that Sundance or IFC doesn't rerun the show because Donal and Kevin make this an Indie Film Sitcom.",5,The Year the Show Bounced between Fox & WB,1152057600,"07 5, 2006",2006,727,"['third', 'season', 'Grounded', 'Life', 'found', 'going', 'Fox', 'WB', 'was', 'messed', 'up', 'season', '3', 'episodes', 'aired', 'Fox', '8', 'WB', '2', 'DVD', 'set', 'will', 'contain', '13', 'episodes', 'So', ""'ll"", 'get', 'see', '2', 'episodes', 'never', 'aired', 'network.There', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'commentary', 'tracks', '6', 'episodes', ""'ll"", 'get', 'inside', 'tales', 'went', 'season', 'show', 'jumped', 'networks', 'Lily', 'Sister', 'Helen', 'will', 'be', 'speaking.Even', 'ABC', 'Family', 'Channel', 'show', 'enjoy', 'better', 'DVD', 'especially', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'watch', '10', 'minutes', 'ads', 'get', 'episode', 'shame', 'Sundance', 'IFC', ""n't"", 'rerun', 'show', 'Donal', 'Kevin', 'make', 'Indie', 'Film', 'Sitcom']",N/A

This is a good series and this season offers more laughs. If you were a big fan of the series than youll enjoy these episodes.*it says it has 2 episodes that havht been aired but thats no longer true.
