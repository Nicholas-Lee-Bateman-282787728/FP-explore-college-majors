The fights were believable, and the comic relief was well timed. It had Villians to both love and hate.  It had an energizing theme song, and powerful battle music.  This was a series to love.Was excited when it finally came out on DVD, only to find it was altered for DVD.  The background music had been changed for several fight scenes, including the final battle.  Worse the Theme Song was changed.  The Changed fight scenes music doesn't work with the actions of the characters, and the changed Theme should be a a cure for insomnia.The TV series is 5 stars, this DVD set barely deserves 3.",3,"Great series, terrible DVD",1353110400,"11 17, 2012",2012,716,"['watched', 'series', 'pilot', 'finale', 'Batman', 'daughter', 'Dina', 'Barbara', 'were', 'alive', 'evolving', 'entertaining', 'fights', 'were', 'believable', 'comic', 'relief', 'was', 'well', 'timed', 'had', 'Villians', 'love', 'hate', 'had', 'energizing', 'theme', 'song', 'powerful', 'battle', 'music', 'was', 'series', 'love.Was', 'excited', 'when', 'finally', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', 'only', 'find', 'was', 'altered', 'DVD', 'background', 'music', 'had', 'been', 'changed', 'several', 'fight', 'scenes', 'including', 'final', 'battle', 'Worse', 'Theme', 'Song', 'was', 'changed', 'Changed', 'fight', 'scenes', 'music', ""n't"", 'work', 'actions', 'characters', 'changed', 'Theme', 'should', 'be', 'cure', 'insomnia.The', 'TV', 'series', '5', 'stars', 'DVD', 'set', 'barely', '3']",Birds of Prey:CSR (DVD)
1087014,A1N10ZN3IQUA6E,B000SMNL92,"Allen Berry ""Emerald Archer""","[0, 0]","This was a slick, well written, well plotted series, with excellent performances and great action sequences. It starred the always delightful Dina Meyer, as well as new comers Ashley Scott and Rachel Skarsten. Loosely based on the DC comic team headed by Barbara Gordon after being paralyzed by the Joker in &#34;The Killing Joke,&#34; re-told with a more tragic outcome in this alternate DC Universe, wherein Batman has left Gotham, the heroins of Birds of Prey protect New Gotham from crime, both street level and super powered.This was the WB's attempt at expanding the super hero franchise already gaining popularity with Smallville, before they were the CW. This would likely explain why Birds boasts a cast that is &#34;CW hot,&#34; with a soundtrack from the hottest up and coming musical acts of the day, and to be fair, the production is extremely slick. The series also featured cameos by Batman, Cat Woman, and the Joker... at least in the opening credits. And there is a continuing sub-plot with Harley Quinn as a Psychiatrist with a dark agenda to rebuild the Joker's empire.The unfortunate truth is it failed to find an audience among the fan boys and Dawson's Creek devotees that built the network into a real contender. In it's original airings, the show was frequently pre-empted for other programs, and was decidedly hard to catch when it did air. Thankfully, the CW has revised its policy, and maintains a reputation as a network that will give shows more than a fair shake.  This, of course, comes too late for the ill-fated Birds of Prey. :(The painful irony of Birds is that with the inception of the New 52 in DC Comics, the sort of alternate storyline that provides the basis for Birds is not uncommon. In the current continuity, Huntress is the daughter of Batman of an alternate earth, and is paired with Power Girl.  Black Canary remains a core member of the super team, but Oracle is now Batgirl, the Killing Joke timeline having been obliterated by the arrival of the new continuity.Perhaps what brought the end of the show was the fact that it was Batman without Batman.  As a hardcore, long-time comic book fan, I have great appreciation for the show, but a mainstream audience would likely be lost in New Gotham. Still, without the Birds of Prey helping lay the ground work for a superhero series on an upstart network (ABC's attempt with the 1990's The Flash notwithstanding), we might not have had the series that followed. Current cash cow: Arrow, and the upcoming CW treatment of the Scarlet Speedster might never have found a home were it not for a small but loyal group of fans who watched, loved, and maybe even clamored for more.Many comic book and comic book adaptation fans may grind their teeth when they hear the series mentioned, I read where it made the list of worst comic book adaptations ever, but the series has its charm.",4,Only the Good Die Young. :(,1402272000,"06 9, 2014",2014,2872,"['was', 'slick', 'well', 'written', 'well', 'plotted', 'series', 'excellent', 'performances', 'great', 'action', 'sequences', 'starred', 'always', 'delightful', 'Dina', 'Meyer', 'as', 'well', 'new', 'comers', 'Ashley', 'Scott', 'Rachel', 'Skarsten', 'Loosely', 'based', 'DC', 'comic', 'team', 'headed', 'Barbara', 'Gordon', 'being', 'paralyzed', 'Joker', '34', 'Killing', 'Joke', '34', 're-told', 'more', 'tragic', 'outcome', 'alternate', 'DC', 'Universe', 'wherein', 'Batman', 'left', 'Gotham', 'heroins', 'Birds', 'Prey', 'protect', 'New', 'Gotham', 'crime', 'street', 'level', 'super', 'powered.This', 'was', 'WB', 'attempt', 'expanding', 'super', 'hero', 'franchise', 'already', 'gaining', 'popularity', 'Smallville', 'were', 'CW', 'would', 'likely', 'explain', 'why', 'Birds', 'cast', '34', 'CW', 'hot', '34', 'soundtrack', 'hottest', 'up', 'coming', 'musical', 'acts', 'day', 'be', 'fair', 'production', 'extremely', 'slick', 'series', 'also', 'featured', 'cameos', 'Batman', 'Cat', 'Woman', 'Joker', 'least', 'opening', 'credits', 'continuing', 'sub-plot', 'Harley', 'Quinn', 'Psychiatrist', 'dark', 'agenda', 'rebuild', 'Joker', 'empire.The', 'unfortunate', 'truth', 'failed', 'find', 'audience', 'fan', 'boys', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'devotees', 'built', 'network', 'real', 'contender', 'original', 'airings', 'show', 'was', 'frequently', 'pre-empted', 'other', 'programs', 'was', 'decidedly', 'hard', 'catch', 'when', 'did', 'air', 'Thankfully', 'CW', 'revised', 'policy', 'reputation', 'network', 'will', 'give', 'shows', 'more', 'fair', 'shake', 'course', 'too', 'late', 'ill-fated', 'Birds', 'Prey', 'painful', 'irony', 'Birds', 'inception', 'New', '52', 'DC', 'Comics', 'sort', 'alternate', 'storyline', 'basis', 'Birds', 'not', 'uncommon', 'current', 'continuity', 'Huntress', 'daughter', 'Batman', 'alternate', 'earth', 'paired', 'Power', 'Girl', 'Black', 'Canary', 'core', 'member', 'super', 'team', 'Oracle', 'now', 'Batgirl', 'Killing', 'Joke', 'timeline', 'having', 'been', 'obliterated', 'arrival', 'new', 'continuity.Perhaps', 'what', 'brought', 'end', 'show', 'was', 'fact', 'was', 'Batman', 'Batman', 'hardcore', 'long-time', 'comic', 'book', 'fan', 'have', 'great', 'appreciation', 'show', 'mainstream', 'audience', 'would', 'likely', 'be', 'lost', 'New', 'Gotham', 'Still', 'Birds', 'Prey', 'helping', 'lay', 'ground', 'work', 'superhero', 'series', 'upstart', 'network', 'ABC', 'attempt', '1990', 'Flash', 'notwithstanding', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'series', 'followed', 'Current', 'cash', 'cow', 'Arrow', 'upcoming', 'CW', 'treatment', 'Scarlet', 'Speedster', 'might', 'never', 'have', 'found', 'home', 'were', 'not', 'small', 'loyal', 'group', 'fans', 'who', 'watched', 'loved', 'maybe', 'even', 'clamored', 'more.Many', 'comic', 'book', 'comic', 'book', 'adaptation', 'fans', 'may', 'grind', 'teeth', 'when', 'hear', 'series', 'mentioned', 'read', 'where', 'made', 'list', 'worst', 'comic', 'book', 'adaptations', 'ever', 'series', 'charm']",Birds of Prey:CSR (DVD)

Having seen it a million times on the shelf since its' release, I finally picked it up just to see what Birds of Prey was about. When I found out it was about The Gotham Girls, I was sold. I bought it. After giving it a watch, I can honestly say- the showed had alot of promise. There was plenty of action, lots of eyecandy, and pretty good acting.However, I know I'm being critical here, where the show lacked for me was when it showed flashbacks. If you look at the show as a whole, they really went out with FX at times yet, when they did the flashbacks, it look like a couple of amateurs made it with costumes rented out from a local costume shop. Why? Heck, even you could see through the fighting choreography.Nitpicks aside, it did get reasonably better by the end of the series. I do believe, if it were given more time on television with more seasons, the show would have grown into something much more worthy of the Batman mythos. That's something I can't understand...why can't these networks let shows have, at least, two seasons to really get its' stride and show what it can do? That happens alot, especially when it comes to superhero/sci-fi type shows(like one of my favorites, Batman Beyond). At it stands, though, this show didn't get a chance to and this is all we have.Do I think it is worth a purchase? Yes and No. Yes, especially for all the Batman fans or fans of the Gotham Girls. No, for anyone else...you'll probably find this show pretty boring because you won't have a clue as to why things are the way they are in the show when Batman should be there.As it stands, Birds of Prey is an awesome show. I really enjoyed it and will probably enjoy repeated viewings of it.

It was a really exciting action show, breaking new ground because ALL of the lead characters were women.This boxed set collects all 13 episodes and a never-collected-on-DVD before Flash-animated series ""Gotham Girls.""Awesomely, it also includes the unaired pilot, which featured Sherilyn Fenn (Twin Peaks) in the role of Dr. Quinzel. Mia Sara was later cast as Quinzel in the series. She also appeared in the AIRED pilot. Interestingly, all of the scenes featuring the character in the AIRED pilot were reshot with Sara, word-for-word.Also of note, the aspect ratio of the episodes in the set will be full frame, but will have dark bars on top and on bottom to mimic widescreen.While normal citizens slept, the Birds of Prey flocked together to fight crime on the streets of New Gotham City. Several years after the city was abandoned by Batman, the awesome threesome of Huntress (Ashley Scott), Oracle (Dina Meyer), and Black Canary (Rachel Skarsten) was formed. Huntress is the daughter of Batman and Catwoman, and can smell danger from miles away. Black Canary has the gift of clairvoyance and Oracle leads the team through her cyber experience, despite being wheelchair bound by Batman's nemesis, the evil Joker.When the series opens, we learn that New Gotham's Batman has disappeared leaving behind a daughter from his long-time love Catwoman. Her name is Helena Kyle, who transforms herself into the mysterious superhero known as ""The Huntress."" Helena has hypersensitive senses and agility, but uses her gifts selfishly. Fate brings her face-to-face with her choices as well as a wheel-chair-bound Barbara Gordon, the hero Oracle, who befriends her but agrees to train her only if she uses her powers for good.She teams up with Barbara, who had been ""Batgirl"" prior to being paralyzed by the Joker. By day, Barbara is a teacher at New Gotham High, but by night she fights crime from her secret lair in the New Gotham Clock Tower.The two meet a determined Dinah Redmond, a young woman who was drawn to New Gotham to learn more about her powers. Dinah is a touch-telepath and psychic who had terrifying dreams about Batgirl's brutal incident that resulted in her paralysis. The Huntress resists working with Dinah, but Oracle convinces her to give the younger woman a chance. Now, they must learn not only how to work together as New Gotham's protectors, but also as a family.Special recognition goes to Mark ""Star Wars"" Hamill who briefly reprises his award-winning voice role as the Joker from the iconic classic, Batman: the Animated Series. In Birds of Prey, ""Mister J"" on-camera is portrayed by actor/stuntman Roger Stoneburner but Hamill's voice was dubbed over Stoneburner's performance.During the course of the series, the women are often confronted with schemes masterminded by the Joker's on-and-off girlfriend, psychiatrist Dr. Harleen ""Harley Quinn"" Quinzel (Mia Sara), but they always prevail and eventually beat her at her own game.Other characters of note are: Alfred Pennyworth (Ian Abercrombie), who serves Helena as heir to the Wayne estate, and Police Detective Jesse Resse (Shemar Moore), confronted with crimes and abilities he cannot explain.A central feature of the series is the concept of metahumans: Individuals born with powers that cannot be explained. No two metahumans have the same specific ability (or set of abilities) and there exists a whole sub culture of metahuman society that the outside world knows nothing about.It is this world that Detective Reese is drawn into, reluctantly teaming up with Huntress and the Birds of Prey to defeat metahuman criminals. At first, he is disapproving of Helena's vigilantism, even trying to arrest her, but eventually he realizes there is a need for the Birds of Prey to take down criminals the police can't handle.Episodes in this four-disc collection are: the Pilot; Slick; Prey for the Hunter; Three Birds and a Baby; Sins of the Mother; Primal Scream; Split; Lady Shiva; Nature of the Beast; Gladiatrix; Reunion; Feat of Clay; and Devil's Eyes.Very popular theme song ""Revolution"" was performed by Aimee Allen.",5,MEANWHILE...back at the Clock Tower!!,1207267200,"04 4, 2008",2008,4864,"['five',

While I enjoyed the acting of the cast, I was on the whole not overly impressed with the show itself.  I found some of the episodes way too predictable while I found other things quite implausible.

1087041,A2GBBDNZLYC4A9,B000SMNL92,"Jeff Johnson ""Jeff Johnson""","[7, 16]","Batman & Cat Woman had a daughter who is the Huntress and the main focus of the series. I love Batman and superheroes in general. I've followed the Batman legacy intently and this follows it to, but this series has major flaws.- First off, this feels more like Dawson's Creek or a typical WB show. Especially with the generic female sang pop rock music.- All female cast. Aren't there any men in this world? Well yes there are men, but they play villains and side story love interests.- A main character cop that wants to know a superhero's name. This is a superhero that doesn't wear a mask. Oh and this cop is a COP! He has the authority to demand ID. If he didn't have that authority, he can probably look at newspaper photos and see oh that's Selina Kyle's daughter. Duh! She was there when her mom was stabbed to death in the street (like Bruce Wayne's father was shot).- These aren't super heroes. They're metahuman with metapowers. They hang out at the metabar. There's a meta killer killing metahumans. They use the word meta so often that its bad comedy.- Its interesting seeing 2 attractive white women say the other doesn't understand what its like being a different race... The meta race.- The thing that made Batman stand out was the fact that no one had superpowers. Everyone in Batman's world was a human that was either really smart or abnormally athletic.- This feels like I'm watching an all female X-Men, because EVERYONE has Metapowers... except Barbra Gordon who is in a wheelchair, just like professor X. Especially because she teaches at a school...- So with Barbra as a HS teacher in the series, that's the perfect setup for the third Bird of Prey who is a 16 year old girl. So there's a lot of HS. This is a staple of WB made programming. Gilmore Girls, Smallville, Dawson's Creek. Even the Terminator series was produced by WB (but aired on Fox) and had a high school. Who am I to complain about this? Teens read comics, they're just shooting for their target audience... If they aired the Golden Girls, all 4 of them would be teachers at a HS.- The before mentioned 16 year old saves the day at the end of a lot of episodes. I'm sure Robin saved the day too, but not after every hour long episode. It just feels cheap.- The special effects are laughable, but hey what do you expect?- There's CGI when there doesn't really need to be. Sure there's CGI cut scenes, that's understandable, but where its not needed is having Huntress running on the top of buildings in CGI.- Two openings. So they kick off each episode with a spiel about how this is Batman & Cat Woman's daughter. Then they have an intro into the story. Then they have a second opening... What?- The general public doesn't seem to know who Batman is and the series takes place 7 years after he retired. I'm sure if there were news reports of a vigilante dressed as a bat saving the city from super villains, you'd remember.- There are so many bad fight scenes where Huntress is usually down close to the ground with one hand touching the pavement, her legs parted and then her head flips back and she looks straight toward her adversary.

Fast forward to NOW and I picked up the entire series, feeling maybe I didn't give it a fair shake. I watched EVERY episode. And now I can tell you with certainty that it is terrible.I don't care about the liberties taken with the characters. And I LOVE the characters. I own most of the comic series. But you can't make a TV show (or movie) without changing stuff around to make it accessible to the general public.What I SERIOUSLY cared about was how badly this show was put together. Yeah, the two intros were annoying every episode, but that's why God invented the fast forward button. What cheesed me off was that the show didn't even hold its own continuity through the series. In the first episode, Joker kills Helena's mom and then shoots Babs before Batman can get to her. THEN, later in the series, it turns out that Clayface killed Helena's mom and Babs knew about it. Huh? And, speaking of Clayface, his make-up job was literally a dude with mud smeared all over his face. The special effects were terrible. The ironic thing is that Clayface is in this elaborate sealed chamber in a room straight out of Silence of the Lambs (he even does the quid pro quo thing with Huntress) but the set looked expensive and the character looked like he got a five minute, five dollar make-up job. Makes no sense. What makes even LESS sense is that they shot every fight scene in every episode in slow motion, giving you a REALLY good look at the stunt doubles faces as they kicked and punched and flipped around. And, in most cases, they barely resembled the main actresses. And, swear to Robin, some of the stunt doubles was DUDES.Skip it. Mia Sara was over the top and the only bright spot in this series.

1087053,A1X1YUHSEX3UZU,B000SMNL92,marla a. sharp,"[0, 0]","This is one of those 'hidden gems' series.  Clever witted, good humored--with the drama of shows like Smallville and Buffy the Vampire Slayer--it captures the 'comic book' feel exactly.  Set in Gotham, it holds shadows but it never is overcome by them.  Oracle has gently wistful longing for her Batgirl days and struggles quietly to continue a fight against evil without the help of Batman, fully trained companions, or even the use of her legs.  Dina Meyer does a beautiful portrayal of a true superhero.  She is by turns strong, graceful, intelligent, courageous, determined, loving, and good humored.  There is something about her that draws the heart and causes it to attach--reminiscent of Lynda Carter's Wonder Woman and Clark Gregg's Agent Coulson of Shield.  When you watch her, you really believe she IS Oracle.  Oracle's young partner in training--Huntress--is very nearly opposite her mentor: feisty, snarky, seductive, impulsive and headstrong.  And this makes for a humorous and natural feeling dynamic between them that is part mentor/prot&eacute;g&eacute;, part mother/daughter, part older sister/younger sister, and part long time friends.  The clever addition of the teenage daughter of Canary to their small team, however, is brilliant as it immediately throws their balanced world into chaos and forces each one of them to begin putting aside long held hurts and fears to become a family of sorts.Superhero shows naturally have a lot of adventure, but what makes this one shine is the same thing that made Wonder Woman and now Agents of Shield shine--a focus on the characters rather than on the 'flash bang'.  This is about the people beneath the 'cape', their strengths and weaknesses, their grief and hope.  About trying to really live while still doing the superhero 'calling'.Fans of comic books and superhero shows who pay careful attention will find a lot of really clever references and playful bows throughout the series.  Everyone else will find a lot of witty humor.  (&#34;Hey!  Absolutely no use of superpowers to settle domestic disputes!&#34; and &#34;YOU try fighting the forces of evil on low blood sugar.&#34;)  This balances against the darker aspects of the show well and prevents things from becoming too grim.  Villainy, murder, death, angst, grief, abandonment, failure, despair, and more all remain, but what surpasses them is heroism, hope, love, family, courage, persistence, and duty.  No, they don't always win.  But they grieve and rage and grit their teeth and go on.  And somehow become better for it all.It's not the modern massive battle scale and constant run of theater superhero movies.  But then, again, that's not its point.  This is about the people.

1087054,AUOIOJ1CSPO99,B000SMNL92,Matt B.,"[1, 1]","I had so much excitement about getting this show once is was released in the summer. Having never seen it before and loving Smallville, a show by the same producers, I was really eager to love this short-lived show based on the three heroines fighting crime in a Batmanless New Gotham City. I watched the pilot with a few other people. They absolutely hated it, and I decided it was okay and I would continue to watch. The acting was not that hot, even if the main girl, played by Ashley Scott, was, and the visual effects were pretty crappy considering the time. The overall production values weren't horrible but the overlooking shots of New Gotham City looked corny, even though I liked and appreciated the flying, whizzing shots twisting around the buildings and zooming in on an over the top New Gotham Police Department. The writing was shaky, but the overall plotlines of each episode were adequate. I particularly loved the episode called Slick, about the water Metahuman  who drowns people on dry land. Some good effects were used well in this one. But that's the only episode I REALLY liked. The thing is with this show, everything in it is used, nothing really new going on. Metahumans in this. Meteor Freaks and aliens in Smallville. Three strong female heroines, been done in Charmed and countless others. I was really looking forward to this because I love Batman stuff and basically anything superheroish and this show fell considerably short for me. This show is NOT for people who like Batman. I'd recommend this to the younger crowd who aren't as experience in shows like this.

1087055,A4EFCH8II6U3P,B000SMNL92,Medraut,"[2, 3]","First off a bit of explination.There is more then one version of the Huntress. one version is the daughter of Bruce Wayne (Batman) and Selena Kyle (Catwoman), who are married. their daughter is Helena Wayne. After the tragic death of Catwoman Helena becomes the Huntress a vigilanti in the spirit of both her parents. I rather like this verison. for one thing Im a sucker for Batman and Catwoman getting together.That version was erased. Another version is Helena the daughter of a mob boss. her family is killed and she becomes the Huntress. this version joins the Birds of Prey. which consists of Black Canary and Oracle. Oracle is Barbra Gordon after she has been shot and paralized.this series is loosly based off the comics but it adapts differant elements. I have to say I rather like the result.however.. i dont entirly like the meta human angle. as i see it to much as DC's version of Marvels mutants and Xmen.allthough it was nice that they gave a nodd to Smallville, sugesting metahumans could be created by falling metors.moving on..here Helena Kyle is the illagitamit child of Bruce and Selena. Helena is also half meta human. her mother being a full meta human. Helena has half her mother's powers. having catlike reflexes and movements. Bruce seems unaware he has a daughter. Catwoman reformed to raise her daughter.the Batman was fighting a war on crime against the Joker. Batman destroys his empire. in revenge the Joker sends a man to kill Catwoman. helena watches helplessly as her mother is stabbed. she is left alone in the world. menwhile the Joker hunts down Barbra Gordon who is Batgirl. he then shoots her (in a nodd to The Killing Joke). by the by its nice that they got Mark Hammil to voice the Joker for the pilot. he had already voiced the charture in the animated series. he is the best voice for the joker. Barbra is left paralized and becomes Oracal a wizard at computers and 'master of the cyber realms'. at the same time young Dinah is a meta human powers who sees the tragic death of Catwoman and Barbra's shooting. Dinah is reveild to be the daughter of Black Canary. Barbra raises Helena while she is teaching at a school. Barbra also trains her. Helena becomes the Huntress. when older Dinah seeks out both of them and they become the Birds of Prey. batman in the mentime has dissapeared without a trace. the joker is also gone. gotham is a new place swamped with crime. only the Birds of Prey are left to defend the city. however there is one major crime lord left a remnent of the Joker's rule. she is Harlen Quinzel or Harley Quinn (played very well by Mia Sara). by day she is a psychartrist, by night she plots to destroy the city. she wants to set down the very city that her love, the Joker, wanted to destroy himself.  (So far this is the only live action version of Harly Quinn, and quit a good one I thought).there are only thirteen episodes to this series. sadly it was canceled. which is a shame all the actors did a good job they had such potential. all the stories may not be great but some were good. it was an all to brief series, but a good one.the episodes...-Begining.We are introduced the main chartures. including Detecitve Jesse Reese who meets the Huntress. Alfred is present. we meet Wade a teacher with a thing for Barbra. meantime a deadly meta human is in town and the Birds of Prey hunt him down. (the pilot was reshot, the orginal with a differnt Harley. its just as well Sara is much better in the role).-SlickSlick a metahuman is hunting down cops with a hidden agenda. the Huntress seeks to hunt him down and stop him. both are trying to learn more about Dinah who so far has not been honest about her past.-Prey for the HunterHelena and Reese clash when tracking down a killer. Reese feels he can not trust her which causes a rift between them in this case.-Three Birds and a BabyHelena finds a strange boy left alone. however this boy has an unusal growth rate. the boy has a connection to Harly who wants him back at any cost.-Sins of the MotherDinah is confronted by her mother the Black Canary. an old crime boss is out to capture Canary and destroy her. Dinah is saddened when her mother is taken from her.-Primal ScreamHelena goes undercover to catch a gang of theives but she is having too much fun, which could get her into trouble. Dinah is on edge since the death of her mother. filled with rage and anger. (a very good episode for Dinah i thought).-SplitDarkstrike is in town hunting down a killer. reluctantly Helna joins him, but all is not as it seems. Dinah learns the distrubing truth about the killer they seek.-Lady Shivalong ago Barbra fought Lady Shiva and thought she died in an acident. however she survived but her sister did not. shiva is out for revenge. Barbra risks everything to face her. she uses a subnural network to walk for a time, even though it causes he great pain. its up to Helana to stop Barbra. (this was a great episode for Barbras charture. also its the first live action version of Lady Shiva).-Nature of the BeastReese asks Helena to protect a mob boss. however it is the same mob boss responsible for the death of Black Canary. helena is reluctant, espisly when Reese reveals his ties to this mob boss. Dinah however wants revenge.-GladiatrixMetahuman women are being kidnaped and forced to fight. they are given a drug to make them more agressive. helna and Dinah both become captives and subcumb to the drugs effects. they are forced to fight. its up to Barbra and Reese to find the solution.-RunionHelena doesnt want to go to her highschool reunion. however a killer is stalking her ex classmates. she is forced to take part in order to find the killer. in the process she becomes fare closer to Reese.-Feet of Claya killer is turning people into clay. Helena seeks out ClayFace still in Arkham to find out more about the killer. in the process she learns the truth about her mother's death. (this is the as yet only live action version of Clay Face. there are elements of the Prester Payne clay face in this story). Barbra and Wade become much closer in this episode.-Devil EyesHarley has learned Helna's secret. she uses a machine to give herself hypnotic powers. she then hypnotises Helena and takes over the Clock Tower. she kills those in her way. gotham is at her command and she sends the city into madness. its up to Barbra and Dinah to captur Helena and bring her to her sensis. then they must captur the Clock Tower and save the city. (this is a very good episode for Harely's charture. Sara shines in her senes).sadly this was the end of the series.all in all a good series, not a Great series, but a good one, with good actors and chartures whose potential could have been further explored. a good addition to the Batman legend.there are a few off moments. the CGI isnt great. epsepicly for the city landscape, some of the lines arent well written, a few of the actors arent great, but that dosent mean this series is bad. it has a lot of potential.one note however, yes indeed the music used when the show was on air is not used for the DVD. unlike some Smallville DVDs the company just didnt seem willing to pay for the rights for the music for the dvd of Brids.as an added bonus when you buy this DVD your getting not one but two series.included is Gotham Girls.Gotham Girls was an online animated feature.its started out as gamesbecoming a full storyline.the complete series of gotham Girls is inculded here.it featurs Harly Quinn, Poison Ivy, Catwoman, Renne Montoia, and Batgirl. the animation is in the same line as the New adventures of the Batman Animated series. with the same voices.its a pleasnt additon to this DVDallthough the two series really are not related, save for a few similur chartures.so all in all i think this is a DVd worth having.a very good short series.",3,Short but Sweet,1249084800,"08 1, 2009",2009,7813,"['First', 'off', 'bit',

1087056,A2V2XET6WEPJ0Q,B000SMNL92,Michael Romero,"[15, 20]","I LOOOVED this show when it premiered on the WB. I even started collecting the comic book after the show premiered. Even though the show was completely different from the comic book I always LOVED the idea that Huntress was the daughter of Batman and Catwoman.The acting was fantastic. Ashley Scott played a great Huntress. What was kind of funny was that Ashley acted a hell of a lot like Batman and Catwoman. Dina Meyer played an awesome Oracle. My favorite episode is when Oracle tried to face off against Lady Shiva. The only character that I really don't remember because she wasn't really interesting was Dinah. She was the psychic. I personally think that they should've just brought in the original Black Canary.The best thing about this show that a lot of hard core Batman fans(like myself) will like is that we get to see other great Batman villans like Clayface, Lady Shiva, (a small glimpse) of the Joker (with the voice of Mark Hamil), and of course we get to see the first flesh and blood Harley Quinn who was just so deliciously evil.This show was phenomenal the WB should've given it another season. If they did we might have gotten to see Bruce Wayne and we could've learned more about Batman's romance with Catwoman and what made Catwoman decide not to tell Batman that she had a daughter, and maybe we might've seen some more great Batman villans.

The story revolves around Helena Kyle, AKA The Huntress (Jericho's Ashley Scott), who just so happens to be the daughter of Batman and Catwoman.  She joins forces with the wheelchair-bound former Batgirl Barbara Gordon (Dina Meyer), and the telepathic Dinah (Rachel Skarsten) to fight crime in Gotham City when Batman mysteriously disappears.  Other familiar faces from the Batman world appear also throughout the course of the series, including trusty butler Alfred (Ian Abercrombie), Harley Quinn (Mia Sara), and even the Joker (played by Roger Stoneburner with the voice of Batman: The Animated Series' own Mark Hamil!), but there were often times when the show just felt as if it wasn't sure of what it was.  Granted though, Birds of Prey never came off as cheesey and sugar-coated as Smallville, and by the time the series came to an end, things were just starting to really pick up.  Despite it's flaws though, Birds of Prey always managed to entertain.  Who knows what might have been, but the fact is Birds of Prey was never given the time and opportunity to grow, which is a crying shame.

The Soundtrack is Lacking with bottom of their catalog replacements for the originals.

1087061,AHF97M45JFCB,B000SMNL92,ONENEO,"[2, 3]","You can almost visualize the board meetings where Warner Brothers and DC discussed the possibility of making Birds of Prey a broadcast television reality:  ""We need a project to appeal to the highly successful primetime teenage drama segment, something like Smallville only less um, Super.""And once that logic settles in, the beauty of selecting Birds of Prey as the source material for a heavily female-based action drama becomes apparent.  It would really require minimal tweaking to mold into a moody crime-solver piece (ala CSI or Law & Order) with a healthy dosage of hormones, melodrama, and action sequences thrown in for good measure.However, before taking it all at face value remember that the source material (at least in the comic medium) wasn't nearly as cut and dry as the show's intro would have you believe.  The character of Huntress (played here by Ashley Scott) was actually developed back in the mid 1970s as a sort of ""what if"" that would be set in Batman mythology but in a alternate universe called Earth-Two.  The idea was simply to present the outlandish proposition that what if Bruce Wayne were to have offspring with a reformed Selena Kyle (Catwoman)?  Their daughter would probably have quite an attitude, not to mention a penchant for kicking major butt.  Taking the ""what if"" theme a bit further, let's look ahead to when Batman basically retires so as to pass on the proverbial torch of Gotham City's dark defender to said daughter.The concept was sound enough (and about on par with a much later, slightly different ""what if"" scenario known as Batman Beyond) and probably would have been lost to the recesses of time forever if not for a 1996 reintroduction through Chuck Dixon's comic project Birds of Prey which featured Barbara Gordon (Oracle) and Dinah Lance (Black Canary) as a super heroine duo.Huntress didn't make an appearance until 2003 under Gail Simone's supervision.  The scenario featured a critically wounded Black Canary who relies upon Huntress and Oracle's combined efforts to be set free.  In celebration of their success, the ladies decide to form a trio.The show mixes and matches a few of the comic ideals (especially noteworthy is the fact that since it was produced in 2002, Huntress as a member of the team actually precedes the comic thread).  Other changes include the setting New Gotham as opposed to Earth-Two and the rather than Huntress being an established heroine who happens to join forces with pre-established Oracle (as in the comics), here we have Barb Gordon taking Helene Kyle in at a young age and basically raising her as her own.Here the trio is rounded out with Dinah Redmond (played by Rachel Skarsten), who is said to be the daughter of the original Black Canary. Here's where things get a little sticky even to the comic book geeks: While Dinah Redmond is in fact the television version of comic book character Dinah Lance, she is never actually known as Black Canary in the show.  In the comics Dinah Lance was the second Black Canary (after her mother, who just so happens to also be named Dinah- Dinah Drake).  Confused yet? Me too.  All you really need to know is that here we have the paralyzed Barb Gordon as oracle, Helena Kyle (Bruce and Selena's love child) as Huntress and a young/ inexperienced Dinah Redmond (pre-Black Canary) as the trio known as the Birds of Prey.Unofficially you could say there's a fourth member in Bruce's kind-hearted butler, Alfred Pennyworth (played by none other than Ian Abercrombie, perhaps best known as Seinfeld's Mr. Pitt).  On the fringe of membership is the made-for-tv character of Detective Jesse Reese (played by Shemar Moore) who, in addition to being an honest cop, happens to have a little love interest in Huntress.The prime antagonist of the show is Paul Dini's (DCAU) character contribution, Dr. Harleen Quinzel (Harley Quinn) played by Mia Sara- yes Mathew Broderick's main squeeze, Sloane Petersen on Ferris Bueller's Day Off!!Consisting of 13-episodes and coming in at a total runtime of 737 minutes, Birds of Prey spans 4 discs and comes equipped with two special features: The unaired pilot episode (which is basically cut up into segments and used throughout the season) and the entire 30-epsiode run of the animated DCAU web series, Gotham Girls.The show's main structure consists of crime-driven stand-alone adventures with slight mystery undertones. The girls play off each other's personalities to solve each case but not before succumbing to estrogen-induced drama, some high school romance bits, and a whole lot of John Woo-esque butt kicking.The acting choices are pretty spot-on but I may be a bit biased on account of the fact that the lean form of Ashley Scott in tight leather is enough to tickle any red-blooded American male's fancy and Dina Meyer has undeniable charming hotness as Oracle/ Barbara.Harley Quinn was a bit of an odd choice as lead villain however simply because of the timeline.  The tale supposedly takes place well-after Joker's apparent manipulation of her gray matter and while we hear that she was once a successful psychotherapist prior to ""Mr. J's"" influence, she is far from the clown-like floozy the DCAU made famous.  In fact she's quite a cold-hearted manipulator in this portrayal, which, though convincing, really does the ditsy source character injustice.For those individuals hoping for an opportunity to witness some of their favorite classic DC rogues, Lady Shiva and Clayface get the nod throughout the 13-episode run but heavy hitters like the Joker are used only in an out-of-focus intro flashback and in reference.Music choices are a little too period trendy to appeal to viewers of all ages but I suspect that teenagers tuning in to the show back in 2002 were quite delighted to hear their favorite Top-40 numbers used in the application.I must confess that a big part of the appeal of this particular box set came in the form of the inclusion of the complete Gotham Girls animated series.  The first two seasons are certainly the weakest in terms of animation quality and simplistic story lines but the third and final season makes up for it by offering one complete ongoing tale involving many of the characters from the impeccable Batman: The Animated Series (including the original voice actors).  Each season is about a half-hour long (what would be considered a single episode usually) but they are a nice treat for the DCAU fan simply because they are available nowhere else.In all Birds of Prey is best when viewed as a soap opera with superhero and action elements laced in rather than as a superhero tale with occasional drama.  The show was clearly slanted to capture the attention of the 18-34 demographic with special attention given to appeal to teen fans of shows like Smallville (which had been nominated for multiple Teen Choice Awards).  The trouble is that despite reaching nearly double the amount of viewers, Birds of Prey lasted only 13-episodes (a single season) opposed to Smallville's 181 episodes/ 9-season run.  Sometimes television, like life, simply isn't fair.",3,Solid But Not Quite Spectacular,1257638400,"11 8, 2009",2009,7080,"['can', 'almost', 'visualize', 'board', 'meetings', 'where', 'Warner',

The premise surprisingly hooked me instantly and that was just the first good thing. The show got all kinds of things right, the acting was very well acted and felt legit, I felt for these characters a lot, the development was impressive and didn't feel rushed or unexpected (discussed later), episode tones differed (mystery, more action, emotional based, intro, backstory's coming back), the villains felt menacing, I got the old dark feel from late night Gothem, Resse's character was used surprisingly well and the backstory felt very plausable. I had a great time watching this.That being said there are some nitpicks. A few evening shots look blue screened but in a way I like it that way. Many action scenes are just sped up from normal time, this didn't bother me except for the finale were every action scene was like this. The character development was rushed during the finale along with the whole finale (but given that the show had been canceled it was to be expected). Some plot bits or development are predictable but it was still fun seeing if I was proven right. Finally episode 3's mystery killer (DETAILED SPOILER AHEAD) was so obvious zooming on Commander Shepard's face when he says ""Makes them blind to what's, (Zoom) right in front of their face"".

1087068,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000SMNL92,Robert Moore,"[0, 0]","I never saw this when it first appeared on the WB a few years ago discovered it for the first time only recently on DVD. This is certainly not a perfect show. It is marred by an intentional attempt to cater for a very young, typical WB audience. The women are all a tad too hip, a tad too well-dressed, their make up just a bit too perfect. There is nothing like what we would later see with Starbuck on BSG, a really tough female hero whose make up wasn't perfect, was attractive but didn't look like a model, and was just a bit over-the-edge. The emotions of the women here on BIRDS OF PREY are not always terribly adult but adolescent. They seem to be intending the show for a younger crowd than a comparable and nearly contemporary show like DARK ANGEL.Despite this youth orientation, the show still had some nice moments. It was a great role for Ashley Scott, who was free after a recurring role the previous year on DARK ANGEL. She later appear on the hideously overrated cult series JERICHO. I would love to see her get a defining role on a good series. She is beautiful, charismatic, athletic, and has enough presence to carry a series, and she very nearly was able to carry this one. The rest of the cast isn't quite up to her level. Dina Meyer doesn't bring quite enough gravitas to her role as Barbara Gordon aka Oracle, the former Batgirl, now paralyzed and relegated to a wheelchair. The team of the title is rounded out by Rachel Skarsten, who plays Dinah Lance. In the DC Universe this is a tad complicated, because that is the name usually given to Black Canary (maybe my least favorite DC hero, simply because her sonic scream is inevitably absurd when translated to film). But on this show Black Canary is supposed to be her mother. Of course, one of the things about Dinah is that her powers are still supposed to be developing. She has some mind reading abilities (upon contact) and powers of telekinesis, but perhaps she would have gained the Black Canary's cry. Also, she had not yet taken on a crime fighting name by the end of the series. Perhaps she would have morphed into a new Black Canary. It would have made the series title make a bit more sense.But here is the thing: most shows get better as they go along. BIRDS OF PREY has all the feel of a show that had not yet found its groove. It had no long story arcs under development apart from romances for the two older women. Although Mia Sara is listed each week as the intended villain, she is never really takes off until the finale (which was written after they learned that the series had been cancelled). She, by the way, plays Dr. Harleen Quinzel aka Harley Quinn, who is usually, of course, allied with the Joker. No doubt her role would have grown in the series.The world that this takes in is rather vague. Or perhaps I haven't read the right books in the DC Universe. Here we see a post-Batman universe. Even though many many familiar super villains are locked up in Arkham Asylum, no one seems to remember Batman or Catwoman. How can they remember Clayface but not Batman? Makes no sense.All in all, I wish that this had lasted longer. I think it would have developed some interesting story lines.BTW, on a small side note, according to IMDB.com Bruce Thomas played Batman in the small snippets in which he is seen. Fans of KYLE XY will know him as Stephen Trager, the father in the family that takes in and adopts Kyle.",4,I really enjoyed seeing this,1244246400,"06 6, 2009",2009,3411,"['never', 'saw', 'when', 'first', 'appeared', 'WB', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'discovered', 'first', 'time', 'only', 'recently', 'DVD', 'certainly', 'not', 'perfect', 'show', 'marred', 'intentional', 'attempt', 'cater', 'very', 'young', 'typical', 'WB', 'audience', 'women', 'are', 'tad', 'too', 'hip', 'tad', 'too', 'well-dressed', 'make', 'up', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'perfect', 'nothing', 'what', 'would', 'later', 'see', 'Starbuck', 'BSG', 'really', 'tough', 'female', 'hero', 'make', 'up', 'was', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'was', 'attractive', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'model', 'was', 'just', 'bit', 'over-the-edge', 'emotions', 'women', 'here', 'BIRDS', 'OF', 'PREY', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'terribly', 'adult', 'adolescent', 'seem', 'be', 'intending', 'show', 'younger', 'crowd', 'comparable', 'nearly', 'contemporary', 'show', 'DARK', 'ANGEL.Despite', 'youth', 'orientation', 'show', 'still', 'had', 'nice', 'moments', 'was', 'great', 'role', 'Ashley', 'Scott', 'who', 'was', 'free', 'recurring', 'role', 'previous', 'year', 'DARK', 'ANGEL', 'later', 'appear', 'hideously', 'overrated', 'cult', 'series', 'JERICHO', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'get', 'defining', 'role', 'good', 'series', 'beautiful', 'charismatic', 'athletic', 'enough', 'presence', 'carry', 'series', 'very', 'nearly', 'was', 'able', 'carry', 'one', 'rest', 'cast', ""n't"", 'quite', 'up', 'level', 'Dina', 'Meyer', ""n't"", 'bring', 'quite', 'enough', 'gravitas', 'role', 'Barbara', 'Gordon', 'aka', 'Oracle', 'former', 'Batgirl', 'now', 'paralyzed', 'relegated', 'wheelchair', 'team', 'title', 'rounded', 'out', 'Rachel', 'Skarsten', 'who', 'Dinah', 'Lance', 'DC', 'Universe', 'tad', 'complicated', 'name', 'usually', 'given', 'Black', 'Canary', 'maybe', 'least', 'favorite', 'DC', 'hero', 'simply', 'sonic', 'scream', 'inevitably', 'absurd', 'when', 'translated', 'film', 'show', 'Black', 'Canary', 'supposed', 'be', 'mother', 'course', 'one', 'things', 'Dinah', 'powers', 'are', 'still', 'supposed', 'be', 'developing', 'mind', 'reading', 'abilities', 'contact', 'powers', 'telekinesis', 'perhaps', 'would', 'have', 'gained', 'Black', 'Canary', 'cry', 'Also', 'had', 'not', 'yet', 'taken', 'crime', 'fighting', 'name', 'end', 'series', 'Perhaps', 'would', 'have', 'morphed', 'new', 'Black', 'Canary', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'series', 'title', 'make', 'bit', 'more', 'sense.But', 'here', 'thing', 'most', 'shows', 'get', 'better', 'go', 'along', 'BIRDS', 'OF', 'PREY', 'feel', 'show', 'had', 'not', 'yet', 'found', 'groove', 'had', 'long', 'story', 'arcs', 'development', 'apart', 'romances', 'two', 'older', 'women', 'Mia', 'Sara', 'listed', 'week', 'intended', 'villain', 'never', 'really', 'finale', 'was', 'written', 'learned', 'series', 'had', 'been', 'cancelled', 'way', 'Dr.', 'Harleen', 'Quinzel', 'aka', 'Harley', 'Quinn', 'who', 'usually', 'course', 'allied', 'Joker', 'No', 'doubt', 'role', 'would', 'have', 'grown', 'series.The', 'world', 'rather', 'vague', 'perhaps', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'right', 'books', 'DC', 'Universe', 'Here', 'see', 'post-Batman', 'universe', 'Even', 'many', 'many', 'familiar', 'super', 'villains', 'are', 'locked', 'up', 'Arkham', 'Asylum', 'one', 'remember', 'Batman', 'Catwoman', 'How', 'can', 'remember', 'Clayface', 'not', 'Batman', 'Makes', 'sense.All', 'wish', 'had', 'lasted', 'longer', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'developed', 'interesting', 'story', 'lines.BTW', 'small', 'side', 'note', 'according', 'IMDB.com', 'Bruce', 'Thomas', 'played', 'Batman', 'small', 'snippets', 'seen', 'Fans', 'KYLE', 'XY', 'will', 'know', 'Stephen', 'Trager', 'father', 'family', 'adopts', 'Kyle']",Birds of Prey:CSR (DVD)
1087069,A2A1HXFSAPA9A5,B000SMNL92,S. Der,"[0, 0]","There was great potential here. The story's premise (which is said in the beginning of every episode) really gives way for a great show. I really think the show was too early for its time. If it was made today and came off of the Arrow series, than it will be mega popular. It would be like what they did with Vampire Diaries and The Originals.Of course, this show had a lot of problems that must be address and fixed. First off, the whole idea of Huntress not wanting to wear a mask and wanting to keep her secret identity a secret was ridiculous. That was brought up and said 3 or 4 times in the whole series. It was just too many times to bring up and she should had realized after the second time, she needs to find a way to cover up her secret identity. I know the creators probably didn't want her to wear a mask because it will take away from her looks, but it didn't need to be a full on head gear or anything. She could had just wore something small over her eyes and I would say she would still look pretty hot that way.I didn't like how the whole love affair with Huntress and detective Jessie. They got together way too fast. They should had saved it for later on into the season and just kept on building more attraction and interest with each other. It felt like Huntress was way more attracted to Jessie than the other way around.At the very end of the show, it didn't seem like the whole series was connecting very well. I remember Barbara Gordan saying, they finally figured out who was the Big Bad that was causing all the trouble. Meaning they were looking for a particular crime boss, but this was the very first time they said anything about it. Every episode felt like their own individual stories and there was nothing connecting all the episodes together as one big season. When exactly did they figured out their was a boss? When did they start looking for her? We, the audience, knew who she was, and we knew what she was doing. But, it felt odd that they knew there was a big bad, but never said anything about it to the audience. To me, it looked like they were just going out every night and stopping whatever evil that came along that night. How did they figured out there was someone making orders and controlling everything?To conclude, I feel this show did some good things. They started a great story and loved how they showed off what super heroes and super villains would look like in live action. They gave it a good shot at what source material they had to use back then. Now, what I didn't like was the scripts for the episodes. All they really needed to do was connect the shows together and make people want to follow every show. Instead, it felt very dull and boring. A person could pretty much just watch a few shows and wouldn't be interested in it anymore. Honestly, I myself didn't want to watch more than a few shows after a while, but I was determined to finish it. It was just that short of a series to be done and over with. lolI only recommend this, if you want to see a short series and don't mind how every show seems unrelated to each other except for the same main characters going out and finding bad guys to punch.",3,"Had a lot of potential, but it just didn't work out",1398124800,"04 22, 2014",2014,3171,"['was', 'great', 'potential', 'here', 'story', 'premise', 'said', 'beginning', 'episode', 'really', 'way', 'great', 'show', 'really', 'think', 'show', 'was', 'too', 'early', 'time', 'was', 'made', 'today', 'came', 'Arrow', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'mega', 'popular', 'would', 'be', 'what', 'did', 'Vampire', 'Diaries', 'Originals.Of', 'course', 'show', 'had', 'lot', 'problems', 'must', 'be', 'address', 'fixed', 'First', 'whole', 'idea', 'Huntress', 'not', 'wanting', 'wear', 'mask', 'wanting', 'keep', 'secret', 'identity', 'secret', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'was', 'brought', 'up', 'said', '3', '4', 'times', 'whole', 'series', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'bring', 'up', 'should', 'had', 'realized', 'second', 'time', 'find', 'way', 'cover', 'up', 'secret', 'identity', 'know', 'creators', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'wear', 'mask', 'will', 'take', 'away', 'looks', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'full', 'head', 'gear', 'anything', 'could', 'had', 'just', 'wore', 'something', 'small', 'eyes', 'would', 'say', 'would', 'still', 'look', 'pretty', 'hot', 'way.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'how', 'whole', 'love', 'affair', 'Huntress', 'detective', 'Jessie', 'got', 'together', 'way', 'too', 'fast', 'should', 'had', 'saved', 'later', 'season', 'just', 'kept', 'building', 'more', 'attraction', 'interest', 'other', 'felt', 'Huntress', 'was', 'way', 'more', 'attracted', 'Jessie', 'other', 'way', 'very', 'end', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'whole', 'series', 'was', 'connecting', 'very', 'well', 'remember', 'Barbara', 'Gordan', 'saying', 'finally', 'figured', 'out', 'who', 'was', 'Big', 'Bad', 'was', 'causing', 'trouble', 'Meaning', 'were', 'looking', 'particular', 'crime', 'boss', 'was', 'very', 'first', 'time', 'said', 'anything', 'Every', 'episode', 'felt', 'own', 'individual', 'stories', 'was', 'nothing', 'connecting', 'episodes', 'together', 'one', 'big', 'season', 'When', 'exactly', 'did', 'figured', 'out', 'was', 'boss', 'When', 'did', 'start', 'looking', 'audience', 'knew', 'who', 'was', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'felt', 'odd', 'knew', 'was', 'big', 'bad', 'never', 'said', 'anything', 'audience', 'looked', 'were', 'just', 'going', 'out', 'night', 'stopping', 'evil', 'came', 'along', 'that', 'night', 'How', 'did', 'figured', 'out', 'there', 'was', 'someone', 'making', 'orders', 'controlling', 'everything', 'conclude', 'feel', 'show', 'did', 'good', 'things', 'started', 'great', 'story', 'loved', 'how', 'showed', 'off', 'what', 'super', 'heroes', 'super', 'villains', 'would', 'look', 'live', 'action', 'gave', 'good', 'shot', 'what', 'source', 'material', 'had', 'use', 'back', 'then', 'Now', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'was', 'scripts', 'episodes', 'really', 'needed', 'do', 'was', 'connect', 'shows', 'together', 'make', 'people', 'want', 'follow', 'show', 'Instead', 'felt', 'very', 'dull', 'boring', 'person', 'could', 'pretty', 'much', 'just', 'watch', 'few', 'shows', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'interested', 'anymore', 'Honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch', 'more', 'few', 'shows', 'while', 'was', 'determined', 'finish', 'was', 'just', 'short', 'series', 'be', 'done', 'only', 'recommend', 'want', 'see', 'short', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'how', 'show', 'unrelated', 'other', 'same', 'main', 'characters', 'going', 'out', 'finding', 'bad', 'guys', 'punch']",Birds of Prey:CSR (DVD)

It's such a cool premise, and at least some of the cast are so good in their roles, that I find myself wishing that it had not been canceled so early in its run. This show functioned as a good complement/counterbalance to Smallvile, including the dark, Gotham color palette and the female lead character. In fact, all three of the central characters here are female (and fairly positive role models for any young girls watching). All of that being said, the overall quality of the show is a bit low, so I can perhaps understand why its flight was so brief.First, Ashley Scott kicks as Huntress - very cool. I also like Dina Meyer as Barbara Gordon/Oracle/Batgirl. For me, those are the two bright spots in terms of cast. The detective guy works pretty well, too. The writing feels a bit odd/forced to me in many of the episodes, which in turn makes the acting awkward. Also, the sets and special effects seem kind of cheap, including the main title segment that repeats at the start of each episode. And I have to say, the ""Clayface"" episode is just painful, what with his very exaggerated accent and bizarrely-written story. However, I do appreciate the effort to include many characters from the Batman mythology.I almost gave this four stars, due to the set itself, which is a very good package. The actual episodes of BoP get the three stars, and I felt that I should stick with that rating. The price is quite good for a ""complete series,"" and the inclusion of three seasons worth of the Gotham Girls web-series was a great idea. You get a bunch of short episode-ettes featuring all of the Bat-verse's main female characters (Batgirl, Poison Ivy, Catwoman, Harley Quinn, etc.) in charmingly animated and frequently funny little stories. Overall, Birds of Prey is not the greatest thing that I have ever seen, but it is halfway decent viewing in a great package, and if you think that you might like the idea of Batman-related characters in a Smallvile-type show, it is worth checking out.",3,"Not perfect, but work taking a look...",1323561600,"12 11, 2011",2011,2142,"['totally', 'missed', 'when', 'aired', 'first', 'experience', 'was', 'DVD', 'set', 'other', 'reviews', 'say', 'show', 'unfulfilled', 'potential', 'such', 'cool', 'premise', 'least', 'cast', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'roles', 'find', 'wishing', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'canceled', 'so', 'early', 'run', 'show', 'functioned', 'good', 'complement/counterbalance', 'Smallvile', 'including', 'dark', 'Gotham', 'color', 'palette', 'female', 'lead', 'character', 'fact', 'three', 'central', 'characters', 'here', 'are', 'female', 'fairly', 'positive', 'role', 'models', 'young', 'girls', 'watching', 'being', 'said', 'overall', 'quality', 'show', 'bit', 'low', 'can', 'perhaps', 'understand', 'why', 'flight', 'was', 'so', 'brief.First', 'Ashley', 'Scott', 'Huntress', 'very', 'cool', 'also', 'Dina', 'Meyer', 'Barbara', 'Gordon/Oracle/Batgirl', 'are', 'two', 'bright', 'spots', 'terms', 'cast', 'detective', 'guy', 'pretty', 'well', 'too', 'writing', 'bit', 'odd/forced', 'many', 'episodes', 'turn', 'acting', 'awkward', 'Also', 'sets', 'special', 'effects', 'seem', 'kind', 'cheap', 'including', 'main', 'title', 'segment', 'start', 'episode', 'have', 'say', 'Clayface', 'episode', 'just', 'painful', 'what', 'very', 'exaggerated', 'accent', 'bizarrely-written', 'story', 'However', 'do', 'appreciate', 'effort', 'include', 'many', 'characters', 'Batman', 'almost', 'gave', 'four', 'stars', 'due', 'set', 'very', 'good', 'package', 'actual', 'episodes', 'BoP', 'get', 'three', 'stars', 'felt', 'should', 'stick', 'rating', 'price', 'quite', 'good', 'complete', 'series', 'inclusion', 'three', 'seasons', 'Gotham', 'Girls', 'web-series', 'was', 'great', 'idea', 'get', 'bunch', 'short', 'episode-ettes', 'featuring', 'Bat-verse', 'main', 'female', 'characters', 'Batgirl', 'Poison', 'Ivy', 'Catwoman', 'Harley', 'Quinn', 'etc', 'charmingly', 'animated', 'frequently', 'funny', 'little', 'stories', 'Overall', 'Birds', 'Prey', 'not', 'greatest', 'thing', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'halfway', 'decent', 'viewing', 'great', 'package', 'think', 'might', 'like', 'idea', 'Batman-related', 'characters', 'Smallvile-type', 'show', 'worth', 'checking', 'out']",Birds of Prey:CSR (DVD)

I've always preferred this storyline in which Batman and Catwoman have a child, but the main issue with the show was the EXTREMELY low budget and they didn't give Huntress a mask, that could have basically given her the mask Black Cat wears and it would have worked. Without the secret Identity Factor the hero plot failed. The first episode, and the last are probably the best. Um hated Black Canary's daughter, but she had cool powers but the actress sucked. I mean if you like batman, buy this, Batman was suppose to guest star in the second season if they had one, but the show wasn't give a chance and they just goofed on the secret identity. Wish they would revamp the show with many corrections, the concept has such great potential.

Who will protect the citizens of Gotham City now that the Bat has gone for good?Citizens of Gotham City, you can now rejoice. The Bat and the Cat had a daughter and her name is Helena better known as the ""Huntress"" and she is prepared to single handedly take over where her father (Batman) left off. During the Joker's rein of terror on Gotham one of Batman's allies Batgirl was seriously wounded and now she must do her crime fighting from a wheelchair. Fortunately for Barbara Gordon (Batgirl) she has been able to reinvent herself as ""Oracle"", the team's cyber specialist. Black Canary (Dinah) is the inexperienced clairvoyant and the newest and youngest member ready and willing to fight crime in Gotham City.Together this new trio of heroes will carry the weight of Gotham City on their shoulders in the pursuit of justice for all of Gotham. The newest trio of crime fighters will live, fight and die together if they have to in an effort to rid Gotham City of its villains once and for all. Welcome to the ""Birds of Prey""The ""Birds of Prey"" was a great series that showed a lot of promise in its early stages, but sadly the show was cancelled after only 13 episodes. Presented for the first time on DVD format all 13 episodes are here for your viewing enjoyment. Fans of the show will be upset to learn that the opening theme song has been changed as well as most of the music from the show. Fans may also be upset with the picture format, its not full screen or widescreen, its fake widescreen. Warner decided to present it in full screen then they added some black bars on the top and bottom to simulate a widescreen effect. Shame on you Warner for changing the music and not picking a picture format and sticking with it.

1087081,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B000SMNL92,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[4, 13]","A laughably bad lot of female lead characters introduces us to the world of New Gotham, where Batman has long since driven himself into exile, and new heroes must wage a war during the night. The 2002 TV show Birds of Prey features the further ideas of fighting crime in a city overrun with criminals, along with spinoffs of Batman's most famous accomplices and enemies. Terribly clich&eacute;d dialogue, poor special effects, superhuman abilities that defeat the power of Batman's admirable humanness, and second-rate acting all create a show that has befitting ideas and appalling execution.Alfred (Ian Abercrombie) still faithfully watches over Batman's family, including the daughter he didn't know he had. After the death of Catwoman, who married Bruce Wayne, Batman has vanished, disenchanted with fighting evil when it continuously brings harm to his loved ones. The Joker (voiced by Mark Hamill) seriously wounds Batgirl (Dina Meyer), confining her to a wheelchair, causing her to take on the name Oracle and play the mastermind behind Gotham's vigilante defense. She takes in Helena Kyle (Ashley Scott), Batman's daughter, who takes up the role of a caped crusader known as The Huntress, and the two help to clean up the streets of the dangerous city.Dinah Lance (Rachel Skarsten) has visions of Oracle and Huntress and knows that she must travel to New Gotham to find her destiny. She possesses Metahuman powers, like Huntress, which allows her to see events in the future (and eventually manipulate the mind) through physical contact. Although Helena is against it, Dinah joins the group to stop a devious plot machinated by Harleen Quinzel (Mia Sara). Together the trio takes on several new super villains and dozens of evildoers as they stand up for everything Batman established in vigilante justice.Many elements are familiar, including the characters of The Joker, Alfred and Batgirl and locations such as Arkham Asylum. But in an attempt to make Gotham and its young female heroes hip, even more things are different. Birds of Prey goes against every major aspect Christopher Nolan has tried to define in Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. Nolan's vision places Batman in a world of serious rivals and deadly consequences, as well as realistic explanations for his crime fighting abilities. Instead of sticking to realism, Birds of Prey allows its characters to possess superhuman powers that transcend mere intelligence and high-tech weaponry. It is this startling X-Men mutation factor that is most disheartening to see in a Batman spinoff.And of course the dialogue doesn't help to ground an already goofy premise with unbelievable superheroes. ""We're the good guys,"" explains Helena - so that the audience certainly won't forget. ""Why don't you carry any weapons?"" inquires detective Reese, a police officer intent on discovering the truths behind Oracle's team of elite crime fighters. ""I am the weapon,"" queries Huntress, as she eludes the detective with a quick cut to her catlike eyes and a ludicrous tiger roar sound effect accompaniment. Helena complains about due recognition from the public, yet doesn't wear a mask, and Dinah gets caught up in ridiculous dramas at school. Most often characters talk to themselves to inform the audience of the progression of the story, and nearly all of the dialogue is sadly humorous due to its poor timing or generic phrasing.Whether the eye-candy trio squares off against Darkstrike, a mysterious water assassin, underground gladiator fighting rings, copes with New Gotham High School, or defends against the assassins of Harley Quinn, Birds of Prey doesn't feel like a Batman series, and certainly doesn't feel original. Often painfully bad dialogue, silly story arcs and dreadful acting round out each episode, which makes the Gotham Girls South Park-style web series special feature more enjoyable than the appropriately short Birds of Prey series.- Mike Massie",2,Birds of Prey Complete Series Review by The Massie Twins,1216425600,"07 19, 2008",2008,3931,"['laughably', 'bad', 'lot', 'female', 'lead', 'characters', 'world', 'New', 'Gotham', 'where', 'Batman', 'long', 'driven', 'exile', 'new', 'heroes', 'must', 'wage', 'war', 'night', '2002', 'TV', 'show', 'Birds', 'Prey', 'further', 'ideas', 'fighting', 'crime', 'city', 'overrun', 'criminals', 'spinoffs', 'Batman', 'most', 'famous', 'accomplices', 'enemies', 'Terribly', 'clich', 'eacute', 'dialogue', 'poor', 'special', 'effects', 'superhuman', 'abilities', 'defeat', 'power', 'Batman', 'admirable', 'humanness', 'second-rate', 'acting', 'create', 'show', 'befitting', 'ideas', 'appalling', 'execution.Alfred', 'Ian', 'Abercrombie', 'still', 'faithfully', 'Batman', 'family', 'including', 'daughter', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'had', 'death', 'Catwoman', 'who', 'married', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'Batman', 'vanished', 'disenchanted', 'fighting', 'evil', 'when', 'continuously', 'harm', 'loved', 'ones', 'Joker', 'voiced', 'Mark', 'Hamill', 'seriously', 'Batgirl', 'Dina', 'Meyer', 'confining', 'wheelchair', 'causing', 'take', 'name', 'Oracle', 'play', 'mastermind', 'Gotham', 'vigilante', 'defense', 'Helena', 'Kyle', 'Ashley', 'Scott', 'Batman', 'daughter', 'who', 'up', 'role', 'caped', 'crusader', 'known', 'Huntress', 'two', 'help', 'clean', 'up', 'streets', 'dangerous', 'city.Dinah', 'Lance', 'Rachel', 'Skarsten', 'visions', 'Oracle', 'Huntress', 'must', 'travel', 'New', 'Gotham', 'find', 'destiny', 'Metahuman', 'powers', 'Huntress', 'see', 'events', 'future', 'eventually', 'manipulate', 'mind', 'physical', 'contact', 'Helena', 'Dinah', 'group', 'stop', 'devious', 'plot', 'machinated', 'Harleen', 'Quinzel', 'Mia', 'Sara', 'trio', 'several', 'new', 'super', 'villains', 'dozens', 'evildoers', 'stand', 'up', 'everything', 'Batman', 'established', 'vigilante', 'justice.Many', 'elements', 'are', 'familiar', 'including', 'characters', 'Joker', 'Alfred', 'Batgirl', 'locations', 'such', 'Arkham', 'Asylum', 'attempt', 'make', 'Gotham', 'young', 'female', 'heroes', 'hip', 'even', 'more', 'things', 'are', 'different', 'Birds', 'Prey', 'major', 'aspect', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'tried', 'define', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Nolan', 'vision', 'places', 'Batman', 'world', 'serious', 'rivals', 'deadly', 'consequences', 'as', 'well', 'realistic', 'explanations', 'crime', 'fighting', 'abilities', 'Instead', 'sticking', 'realism', 'Birds', 'Prey', 'characters', 'possess', 'superhuman', 'powers', 'transcend', 'mere', 'intelligence', 'high-tech', 'weaponry', 'startling', 'X-Men', 'mutation', 'factor', 'most', 'disheartening', 'see', 'Batman', 'spinoff.And', 'course', 'dialogue', ""n't"", 'help', 'ground', 'already', 'goofy', 'premise', 'unbelievable', 'superheroes', ""'re"", 'good', 'guys', 'Helena', 'so', 'audience', 'certainly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'forget', 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'carry', 'weapons', 'detective', 'Reese', 'police', 'officer', 'intent', 'discovering', 'truths', 'Oracle', 'team', 'elite', 'crime', 'fighters', 'am', 'weapon', 'Huntress', 'detective', 'quick', 'cut', 'catlike', 'eyes', 'ludicrous', 'tiger', 'roar', 'sound', 'effect', 'accompaniment', 'Helena', 'due', 'recognition', 'public', 'yet', ""n't"", 'wear', 'mask', 'Dinah', 'caught', 'up', 'ridiculous', 'dramas', 'school', 'Most', 'often', 'characters', 'talk', 'inform', 'audience', 'progression', 'story', 'nearly', 'dialogue', 'sadly', 'humorous', 'due', 'poor', 'timing', 'generic', 'eye-candy', 'trio', 'off', 'Darkstrike', 'mysterious', 'water', 'assassin', 'underground', 'gladiator', 'fighting', 'rings', 'copes', 'New', 'Gotham', 'High', 'School', 'assassins', 'Harley', 'Quinn', 'Birds', 'Prey', ""n't"", 'feel', 'Batman', 'series', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'feel', 'original', 'Often', 'painfully', 'bad', 'dialogue', 'silly', 'story', 'arcs', 'dreadful', 'acting', 'round', 'episode', 'Gotham', 'Girls', 'South', 'Park-style', 'web', 'series', 'special', 'feature', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'appropriately', 'short', 'Birds', 'Prey', 'series.-', 'Mike', 'Massie']",Birds of Prey:CSR (DVD)

1087085,A3BOH0F7V12H7O,B000SMNL92,William Kendall,"[2, 3]","The thirteen episodes of the gone too soon Birds of Prey series are more than welcome in this collection. The series adapted elements of the characters into a character driven series revolving around three primary players. Helena Kyle, as played by Ashley Scott, was the daughter of Batman and Catwoman, waging her own campaign against crime and following in her father's footsteps. Her mentor and partner, Barbara Gordon (a sympathetic Dina Meyer), once Batgirl before being crippled by the Joker, was Oracle, a computer mastermind running the operation. And Dinah (Rachel Skarsten), a runaway and the daughter of the Black Canary, was the newcomer just learning about her powers. Add in a mix of villains through the series with many of them having their strings pulled by Harley Quinn (a deliciously sadistic Mia Sara), and supporting characters like Alfred Pennyworth (wisely played by Ian Abercrombie) and cop Jesse Reese (Shemar Moore), and you had the makings of a good show.It's a shame that the series was ended before its time; the use of three headlining women in such a strong way was welcome, and the characters had depth and personality. The premise played around with various aspects and eras of the DC universe- the Huntress being Helena Kyle predates the mid-eighties Crisis, whereas the Birds of Prey concept and Harley Quinn were post Crisis. The three leads are likeable in their own ways, giving their performances a certain strength, while staying true to who each of them are. Much, much better than the Smallville series which was around at the same time. It's a different spin on the Batman universe, but a welcome one.
