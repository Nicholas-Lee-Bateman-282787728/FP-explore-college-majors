Sitbon ""Raw Head Lex""","[6, 7]","Invader is about a military base, top secret aircraft, brainwashed soldiers and a crazy UFO that can become the head of a giant leathal robot.  What more do you want?  This film nicely combines props, models, stop-motion and computer generated effects into one very nice looking film.  The story was good and the acting above-average.  I was entertained from beginning to end.  Wonderful film that I really enjoyed and can't wait to see again.

I love old sci-fi films and thought this one would be a great movie... until I seen it! It has an awful story, awful acting, and some of the corniest dialogue I have ever heard. It starts out with a great deal of mystery and even has some great action about a quarter of the way into the movie, but then... oh, boy! The movie really starts to drag from here, and all of the things I said about being awful, well they apply to the rest of the film. A comical and sarcastic robot/flying-saucer from Earth is the bad guy who says things like ""You never had the balls to do it"", ""You are a (bleep)!"". The only way you would ever get me to like this film is by forcing me to take mind-altering drugs.NOT RECOMMENDED!",1,One of the worst sci-fi movies ever!,1291852800,"12 9, 2010",2010,859,"['people', 'who', 'gave', 'movie', 'good', 'review', 'must', 'be', 'high', 'when', 'watched', 'thought', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'high', 'order', 'like', 'film', 'love', 'old', 'sci-fi', 'films', 'thought', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'movie', 'seen', 'awful', 'story', 'awful', 'acting', 'corniest', 'dialogue', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'out', 'great', 'deal', 'mystery', 'even', 'great', 'action', 'quarter', 'way', 'movie', 'then', 'oh', 'boy', 'movie', 'really', 'drag', 'here', 'things', 'said', 'being', 'awful', 'well', 'apply', 'rest', 'film', 'comical', 'sarcastic', 'robot/flying-saucer', 'Earth', 'bad', 'guy', 'who', 'things', 'never', 'had', 'balls', 'do', 'are', 'bleep', 'only', 'way', 'would', 'ever', 'get', 'like', 'film', 'forcing', 'take', 'mind-altering', 'drugs.NOT', 'RECOMMENDED']",Invader
1006546,AKCASK72DWN2Q,B000GRUMRI,"Johann Mitchell ""Jo""","[4, 4]","I've hesitated for a while to write a review for this because I was involved in the filming and production of the movie, so I may be a bit prejudiced.The story is actually fabulous, although some of what makes the story so great is the backstory, which was only hinted at in the film, and I hoped that it might have been made a little bit more clear.The backstory is that the US military has found a crashed alien space ship. They couldn't find any aliens, and were a bit puzzled by this.What they failed to realize is that the aliens were right there. They just happened to be aliens that were made up of electrical energy rather than having bodies like humans. The humans that studied them mistook them for computer programs, and downloaded them into a human-built aircraft without realizing that they were actual entities who had traveled through space, radiation and other being-warping things for hundreds, maybe thousands of years and were now totally insane!You can begin to imagine the ensuing chaos.This movie was made a while ago and played in theaters worldwide, and then later was released as a videocassette. The DVD that came out more recently has had some computer graphic effects added to the version. I've heard various opinions from others about how well they match the original footage, and I'd rather not get into a debate about it.I was married just after this was first published and most of the credits are in my married name in anticipation of the event. You can find my credits at [...]and if you wish to discuss anything about the movie, you can contact me by leaving a comment on my blog at [...].Addition: I just noticed they edited this review.

With all the bad reviews I've seen on this movie I was kind of impressed with how neat it turned out. The effects aren't great but they aren't bad either. Starts off slow but takes off after about ten minutes. The acting is kind of bad at times but is very refreashing at the sametime.

Made on a budget that would not buy a small used car, this movie stinks.  The ""special effects"" are not very special, the acting is wooden and the script is awful.  They don't come much worse than this.  Even the SyFy channel would be embarrassed to air this travesty.  To sum it up, this movie is not even good enough to be considered ""camp"".
