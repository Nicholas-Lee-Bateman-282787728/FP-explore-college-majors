The movie overall is a date movie and is good, but most people won't like it if they expect to laugh through the whole thing.  Sure there are funny spots, but the movie isn't great for those.  It's great for the heartwrenching scenes with David Schwimmer and Gwenyth Paltrow.  Including one particular sad one when they play Sheryl Crow's &quot;I Shall Believe.&quot;  David Schwimmer and Gwenyth Paltrow dance to this.  When you see the movie you'll see why this scene is more heartwrenching than it is happy.

I find him annoying, cloying, and repulsive in every role I've seen him in.  He's the major reason I avoid Friends like the plague (although there are plenty of other reasons for that).  But this movie also has the anti-Schwimmer:  Gwyneth Paltrow.  I can't explain exactly why, but I find her enchanting and intriguing. (Maybe it's because she is a terrific actress, or because she seems so sweet and nice even off the screen.)  So, there you have have it.  A movie with two polar extremes ... the hideous and the sublime, the awful and beautiful, the appalling and the ... you get the point.Some people might quickly dismiss this movie as a Graduate wannabe.  There's some truth to that.  The Pallbearer is quite derivative of the Graduate; it's a play on the young man, older woman, younger woman triangle, and it certainly doesn't have the Graduate's silkiness--or it's wise intelligence.  There's nothing in the Pallbearer that matches the uneasy end where Dustin Hoffman and Katherine Ross nervously sit at the back of the bus with this quietly panicky, &quot;What now?&quot; look on their faces.But it does have some well-orchestrated moments, including a brunch from hell, and some genuine, quirky characters.

At just little over an hour & a half, it felt overly long, and dragged. When plied with alcohol, I can easily fall asleep during a particularly dull movie, but I was tired as it was after having not slept well the previous night, and kept having to eat something to keep me awake during this. I never noticed it as much during Friends, but David Schwimmer has one expression and that's the irritating hangdog expression. The whole film felt like the way you feel when you're in a rush, and people are (deliberately) getting in your way, or just coming to a dead stop, and leave you walking off, muttering to yourself. The Pallbearer tries to put a different spin on a romantic comedy and fails miserably.This film's one saving grace is the actress playing Schwimmer's mum, who's never given the decency of a name, just credited by ""Tom's mother"". She was in Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen as Miss Baggoli, although she looked like the mum from Carrie 2 as well. She wasn't on screen apart from a couple of scenes, and she was hilarious, especially in one of her early scenes, when she opens the door to her son's room and finds one of those security chains blocking her way.

Along the way, another high school aquaintence (gwenith paltrow) come into the film as Tom's dream girl.  As tom persues his dream woman, he soon finds himself entangled in wierd situation with the mother of the poor departed.  The movie takes off there.
