I can understand releases from 2010 and earlier but this was released in 2013 when almost every house has widescreen TVs. Even in backward Australia we have just phased out analogue transmissions so most consumers have purchased digital TVs. I sometimes think the release companies are trying to commit company suicide.2. No subtitles. Surprising how many people are deaf or hard of hearing. Surprising how many potential sales (including mine) go down the gurgler.3. Price. OUCH!!!

Cannon,"[18, 19]",SAY ONE FOR ME was made in cinemascope but i but i think this dvd is full screen since all other that were released that were cinemascope films were full screen. So i would not buy this film which i like very much but i already have a copy from tv. And charging a price of 19.99 is shear robbery. They start the movie in widescreen but after the credits it goes full screen it is a disgrace and they should sell them for 5.00.,3,SAY ONE FOR ME,1361404800,"02 21, 2013",2013,426,"['SAY', 'ONE', 'FOR', 'ME', 'was', 'made', 'cinemascope', 'i', 'i', 'think', 'dvd', 'full', 'screen', 'other', 'were', 'released', 'were', 'cinemascope', 'films', 'were', 'full', 'screen', 'i', 'would', 'not', 'buy', 'film', 'i', 'very', 'much', 'i', 'already', 'have', 'copy', 'tv', 'charging', 'price', '19.99', 'shear', 'robbery', 'start', 'movie', 'widescreen', 'credits', 'full', 'screen', 'disgrace', 'should', 'sell', '5.00']",Say One For Me

Debbie Reynolds is hired as a singer but she is more sheltered and isn't used to his worldly ways. Enter Bing Crosby as the priest who is trying to protect her from falling from grace. A mistaken shipment of the wrong suit puts Wagner in his place and he wakes up to his errant ways and repents. Now he and Ms. Reynolds can pursue the romance that has been blooming between them.Ray Walston is a side character with an alcohol problem but at one time was a fine composer and lyricist. With the help and encouragement of the priest, he too finds redemption and writes a beautiful new song about the meaning of Christmas.This movie will have you laughing, crying and just filled with the joy of the season from beginning to end.",5,God is a Restorer,1364947200,"04 3, 2013",2013,792,"['Robert', 'Wagner', 'pious', 'self', 'appreciating', 'owner', 'nightclub', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'hired', 'singer', 'more', 'sheltered', ""n't"", 'used', 'worldly', 'ways', 'Enter', 'Bing', 'Crosby', 'priest', 'who', 'trying', 'protect', 'falling', 'grace', 'mistaken', 'shipment', 'wrong', 'suit', 'Wagner', 'place', 'up', 'errant', 'ways', 'repents', 'Now', 'Ms.', 'Reynolds', 'can', 'pursue', 'romance', 'been', 'blooming', 'them.Ray', 'Walston', 'side', 'character', 'alcohol', 'problem', 'one', 'time', 'was', 'fine', 'composer', 'lyricist', 'help', 'encouragement', 'priest', 'too', 'redemption', 'beautiful', 'new', 'song', 'meaning', 'Christmas.This', 'movie', 'will', 'have', 'laughing', 'crying', 'just', 'filled', 'joy', 'season', 'beginning', 'end']",Say One For Me
