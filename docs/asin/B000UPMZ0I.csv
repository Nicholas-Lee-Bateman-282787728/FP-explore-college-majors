1095878,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000UPMZ0I,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","I'm often critical of the `good teacher saves unruly students' movies, because they are all so similar and formulaic and rarely ever feel fresh or original.  When I got `Up the Down Staircase' in the mail, I was a tad hesitant.  Yes, I wanted to see the film.  I had just seen `To Sir, With Love', and while it was a tad lazy in the film's conclusion and import of message, it was charming and rather delightful, and this film being released in the same year held the same promise.I didn't want to be disappointed.The great thing about `Up the Down Staircase' is that it certainly follows a mold and yet it breaks that mold in order to find depth in all the nooks and crannies.  In fact, as much as I enjoyed `To Sir, With Love', this film is leagues better.  It actually finds ways to make it all make sense and keep a sharp fluidity and natural edit.Sandy Dennis stars as Sylvia Barrett, a young teacher thrust into a bad school where the students are defiant and the teachers are apathetic and she dares to try and make a difference.  The thing is, she really cares and because of that she really does make a difference.  Her students respond to her, they get her teaching style and they feel respected and wanted.  She is shaken to the core by the many diverse personalities and she doubts herself many times because of this.  What is so commendable about the film is that it never questions itself.  It has no qualms with actually `going there', presenting themes that could be considered taboo, especially for the time.  Because of this, the film carries with it a weight and urgency that isn't always associated with films in this genre (at least not in a natural sense).Look for Patrick Bedford in a scene stealing supporting role as a disillusioned teacher.",5,One of the best in the genre...,1380844800,"10 4, 2013",2013,1766,"[""'m"", 'often', 'critical', 'good', 'teacher', 'saves', 'unruly', 'students', 'movies', 'are', 'so', 'similar', 'formulaic', 'rarely', 'ever', 'feel', 'fresh', 'original', 'When', 'got', 'Down', 'Staircase', 'mail', 'was', 'tad', 'hesitant', 'Yes', 'wanted', 'see', 'film', 'had', 'just', 'seen', 'Sir', 'Love', 'was', 'tad', 'lazy', 'film', 'conclusion', 'import', 'message', 'was', 'charming', 'rather', 'delightful', 'film', 'being', 'released', 'same', 'year', 'held', 'same', 'promise.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'disappointed.The', 'great', 'thing', 'Down', 'Staircase', 'certainly', 'mold', 'yet', 'mold', 'order', 'find', 'depth', 'nooks', 'crannies', 'fact', 'as', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'Sir', 'Love', 'film', 'leagues', 'better', 'actually', 'ways', 'make', 'make', 'sense', 'keep', 'sharp', 'fluidity', 'natural', 'edit.Sandy', 'Dennis', 'Sylvia', 'Barrett', 'young', 'teacher', 'thrust', 'bad', 'school', 'where', 'students', 'are', 'defiant', 'teachers', 'are', 'apathetic', 'try', 'make', 'difference', 'thing', 'really', 'cares', 'really', 'make', 'difference', 'students', 'respond', 'get', 'teaching', 'style', 'feel', 'respected', 'wanted', 'shaken', 'core', 'many', 'diverse', 'personalities', 'doubts', 'many', 'times', 'What', 'so', 'commendable', 'film', 'never', 'questions', 'qualms', 'actually', 'going', 'there', 'presenting', 'themes', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'taboo', 'especially', 'time', 'film', 'weight', 'urgency', ""n't"", 'always', 'associated', 'films', 'genre', 'least', 'not', 'natural', 'sense', '.Look', 'Patrick', 'Bedford', 'scene', 'stealing', 'supporting', 'role', 'disillusioned', 'teacher']",N/A

1095880,A1PASRZ81DY9C,B000UPMZ0I,Austin Somlo,"[1, 2]","Viewed: 7/12Rate: 97/12: Ah...Up the Down Staircase reminds me of my first year teaching and the reasons why I quit the job. Forty-five years later after the film was made, the situation has not changed at all, but it is much, much worse today. Teaching kids in an urban school or schools that serve such kids is an impossible job. It does not make things easier when the subject I taught is mathematics: a double edged sword. I came into the job with the best of intentions, and I left the school as the enemy. That's the irony of it all: I have no idea what made me an enemy to these kids. No matter what I did in school, nothing I've said or taught has gone through the kids' empty heads. Academic expectations are nil. Common sense is thrown out of the window. I can safely say that around 80% of the students I've had will end up either in jail, doing drugs, poverty, welfare, and/or six feet under within ten years of high school graduation. Everybody passes no matter what, failing is not allowed. It doesn't matter if somebody knows nothing about anything or does nothing in school. That's the sorry state of education in the United States of America. I ended up quitting the job because of the worthlessness of it. The majority of the time I spent throughout the academic year doing mountains of paperwork, creating lesson plans, and orchestrating the class had gone wasted. Amidst the trials and tribulations, I realized, after trying everything conceivable to me, that I just became a highly paid professional babysitter instead of a mathematics teacher. Now, I am not surprised at all why public/private schools have a difficulty retaining or recruiting top notch teachers that actually know the ins and outs of their subject. The money is simply...not worth it. The frustrations are simply...not worth it. The kids are simply...not worth it. The teachers and administrators are simply...not worth it. Anwyay, I am glad a film like Up the Down Staircase exists because that's exactly what I went through. However, I am peeved by the contrived ending, and I know for sure that Sylvia Barrett would have tendered her resignation regardless. That's the realistic outcome. I think that she did not because simply put, there is absolutely no other job that she could have been qualified for unless it has something to do with writing. That situation is more clear today than it was in the 60's. Cakewalking through a four year university (which I did not; I am only referring to education majors or something else as easy), spending all of the amount of money just to become a teacher, and then finally realizing that the job isn't for him is a rude awakening. That's life. All in all, Up the Down Staircase is a great film minus that unrealistic ending. By the way, Sandy Dennis was a phenomenal actress back then. She was very unusual in what she did, and I am very surprised that she was considered for jobs in Hollywood.

1095883,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000UPMZ0I,Ed Uyeshima,"[5, 5]","Fresh from her acclaimed portrayal of the young professor's frail alcoholic wife in Mike Nichols' classic adaptation of Edward Albee'sWho's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, Sandy Dennis stars in this forgotten 1967 drama that covers familiar territory in the movies, the idealistic high school teacher who must get through to a classroom full of unruly inner-city teens. Variations of the same storyline can be seen in a variety of films likeStand and Deliver,Dangerous Minds, the recentFreedom Writers, and another 1967 film,To Sir, With Lovewith Sidney Poitier. Resuscitated from obscurity in a 2007 DVD release, this one is surprisingly free of the predictable clich&eacute;s that mar most of the films of this genre. Produced by Alan J. Pakula and directed by Robert Mulligan, the same team that made two of my favorites from the 1960's,To Kill a MockingbirdandLove With the Proper Stranger, this film forges its own identity as a positive yet realistic view of the common problems faced by an urban high school overrun with students, short on funds and run by administrators and teachers more interested in maintaining civility in the classrooms than providing an actual education.Into the chaos of Calvin Coolidge High School walks Sylvia Barrett, a young, inexperienced teacher intent on making a difference through the nave methods she developed from her insular, college-trained perspective. You can figure out how her methods are initially greeted and how indifferent her fellow teachers have become to such optimism. However, she perseveres with a blend of patience and subtle defiance, and there is a wonderfully liberated scene where her students become enraptured by the opening paragraphs of Dickens'A Tale of Two Cities. As Miss Barrett gets to know her students and fellow teachers, so do we, and her personal journey leads to revelations that lend emotional resonance to the viewer thanks to Tad Mosel's incisive, unsentimental screenplay (based on Bel Kaufman's1965 best-seller). Interestingly, we never see her life outside of school, which makes the drama within the school environs all the more compelling.Known for her idiosyncratic style and perpetually nervous manner, Dennis uses her unique style to strong effect resulting in a remarkably empathetic performance. Familiar faces dot the supporting cast - Eileen Heckart as a cheery teacher masking an inappropriate crush on a student, Jean Stapleton as a harried administrator, Roy Poole as the tough-minded principal, Sorrell Booke as the poker-faced superintendent, Ruth White as a veteran teacher who teaches Sylvia how to survive the urban jungle, and Florence Stanley as an unctuous, absurdly organized counselor. Looking like a cross between Sal Mineo and John Stamos, Jeff Howard, who later played bit parts in Hal Hartley's films, cannily handles the role of a delinquent with potential, though Patrick Bedford somewhat overdoes his role as a lecherous teacher who dismisses a shy schoolgirl's romantic advances. My only reservation is that the film runs a bit long at 124 minutes. The DVD's only significant extra is the original theatrical trailer.",4,Familiar But Surprisingly Resonant Look at a Young Teacher's Trial by Fire in an Urban High School,1201305600,"01 26, 2008",2008,3128,"['Fresh', 'acclaimed', 'portrayal', 'young', 'professor', 'frail', 'alcoholic', 'wife', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'classic', 'adaptation', 'Edward', ""Albee'sWho"", 'Afraid', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'Sandy', 'Dennis', 'forgotten', '1967', 'drama', 'familiar', 'territory', 'movies', 'idealistic', 'high', 'school', 'teacher', 'who', 'must', 'get', 'classroom', 'full', 'unruly', 'inner-city', 'teens', 'Variations', 'same', 'storyline', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'variety', 'films', 'likeStand', 'Deliver', 'Dangerous', 'Minds', 'recentFreedom', 'Writers', '1967', 'film', 'Sir', 'Lovewith', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'Resuscitated', 'obscurity', '2007', 'DVD', 'release', 'one', 'surprisingly', 'free', 'predictable', 'clich', 'eacute', 'most', 'films', 'genre', 'Produced', 'Alan', 'J.', 'Pakula', 'directed', 'Robert', 'Mulligan', 'same', 'team', 'made', 'two', 'favorites', '1960', 'Kill', 'MockingbirdandLove', 'Proper', 'Stranger', 'film', 'own', 'identity', 'positive', 'yet', 'realistic', 'view', 'common', 'problems', 'faced', 'urban', 'high', 'school', 'overrun', 'students', 'short', 'funds', 'run', 'administrators', 'teachers', 'more', 'interested', 'maintaining', 'civility', 'classrooms', 'providing', 'actual', 'education.Into', 'chaos', 'Calvin', 'Coolidge', 'High', 'School', 'walks', 'Sylvia', 'Barrett', 'young', 'inexperienced', 'teacher', 'intent', 'making', 'difference', 'nave', 'methods', 'developed', 'insular', 'college-trained', 'perspective', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'methods', 'are', 'initially', 'greeted', 'how', 'indifferent', 'fellow', 'teachers', 'have', 'become', 'such', 'optimism', 'However', 'blend', 'patience', 'subtle', 'defiance', 'wonderfully', 'liberated', 'scene', 'where', 'students', 'become', 'enraptured', 'opening', 'paragraphs', 'Dickens', 'A', 'Tale', 'Two', 'Cities', 'Miss', 'Barrett', 'know', 'students', 'fellow', 'teachers', 'so', 'do', 'personal', 'journey', 'revelations', 'lend', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'viewer', 'thanks', 'Tad', 'Mosel', 'incisive', 'unsentimental', 'screenplay', 'based', 'Bel', ""Kaufman's1965"", 'best-seller', 'Interestingly', 'never', 'see', 'life', 'school', 'drama', 'school', 'environs', 'more', 'compelling.Known', 'idiosyncratic', 'style', 'perpetually', 'nervous', 'manner', 'Dennis', 'unique', 'style', 'strong', 'effect', 'resulting', 'remarkably', 'empathetic', 'performance', 'Familiar', 'dot', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Eileen', 'Heckart', 'cheery', 'teacher', 'masking', 'inappropriate', 'crush', 'student', 'Jean', 'Stapleton', 'harried', 'administrator', 'Roy', 'Poole', 'tough-minded', 'principal', 'Sorrell', 'Booke', 'poker-faced', 'superintendent', 'Ruth', 'White', 'veteran', 'teacher', 'who', 'Sylvia', 'how', 'survive', 'urban', 'jungle', 'Florence', 'Stanley', 'unctuous', 'absurdly', 'organized', 'counselor', 'Looking', 'cross', 'Sal', 'Mineo', 'John', 'Stamos', 'Jeff', 'Howard', 'who', 'later', 'played', 'bit', 'parts', 'Hal', 'Hartley', 'films', 'cannily', 'role', 'delinquent', 'potential', 'Patrick', 'Bedford', 'somewhat', 'role', 'lecherous', 'teacher', 'who', 'shy', 'schoolgirl', 'romantic', 'advances', 'only', 'reservation', 'film', 'bit', 'long', '124', 'minutes', 'DVD', 'only', 'significant', 'extra', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer']",N/A

1095885,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000UPMZ0I,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[12, 12]","Bel Kaufman's novel is one of those books that falls into the beloved category for most people who have read it.  This 1967 film does a marvelous job of bringing the antinovel to life.  An &quot;antinovel&quot; is simply an avant-garde novel that offers a radical departure from the convention of the traditional novels, which Kaufman does by offering up letters, memos, directives from the principal, student comments, notes between teachers, school forms, and even papers from wastebaskets to create a vivid picture of first-year teaching Silvia Barrett struggling to deal with the joys of teaching at an inner-city school.  Most of the credit for this film goes to Sandy Dennis for her indelible performance as Miss Barrett and screenwriter Tad Mosel for making the raw elements of Kaufman's novel work.The supporting cast is a perfect mix of recognizable character actors for the teachers and complete unknowns for the students.  Sorrell Booke is the principal, Roy Poole the hardnosed assistant principal, Jean Stapleton the harried secretary, Eileen Heckart and Ruth White the good teachers, and Paul Barringer the moody bad boy of the English Department.  One of the most horrifying scenes I have ever seen in a film is when Barringer's character calmly corrects the love note written to him by a young female student.  He corrects her punctuation and spelling while she has to endure his callous insensitivity, and when Alice jumps from the window of his classroom we are horrified but not surprised.  But this is just one of many memorable scenes in this film.&quot;Up the Down Staircase&quot; is one of those films that inspires people to be teachers, or, better yet, to stay in teaching.  It does not sugarcoat how things are in an inner-city school.  If anything, it pours on the worst aspects of the entire experience.  For Sylvia the problem is that she can barely notice the successes.  Her class is engaged in a spirited discussion of how the opening of Dicken's &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; relates to their own lives, but how can she enjoy their enthusiasm when the assistant principal is complaining about the noise level in her class.  Sylvia has decided to flee to the suburbs and a nice, safe, private school when her decision to have her class act out a trial based on &quot;Silas Marner&quot; bears a most surprising and touching result.  It is amazing how emotional you can get over a student's simple revelations: &quot;Miss Barrett....I'm 'Me.'&quot;  Throughout the film director Robert Mulligan captures the chaos of an overcrowded high school, but at the key moment he frames Sylvia in a long shot as the pivotal moment in her life as a teacher when she learns with unforgettable power how much difference one teacher can have in the life of one student.When I met Sandy Dennis I told her about how my father actually stayed up to watch &quot;The Out of Towners,&quot; which was unusual because my father never stays up late to watch any movie.  She said her father liked that one too.  But it is really as Sylvia Barrett in &quot;Up the Down Staircase,&quot; and not her Oscar winning performance as Honey in &quot;Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; that is how I think most people remember this talented actress.  This film is not simply an American version of &quot;To Sir, With Love,&quot; it is just simply the most inspirational movie about teaching I have ever seen.  And it is better than &quot;Boston Public,&quot; too.

As an innercity public high school student, I remember the snooty kids visiting us from an all-white suburban camelot academy mentioning that it reminded them of ""Up the Down Staircase"".  The late Sandy Dennis' performance as idealistic English teacher Miss Barrett was one of the most undervalued and underrated, and I thought it criminal that she didn't rate at least an Oscar nomination.  A wonderful supporting cast, including a pre-Edith Bunker Jean Stapleton and Eileen Heckert, and the students being played by real high school kids makes this special.  I think you might be surprised how relatively mild these ""delinquents"" act in comparison with the kids today.  At least no kids were packing heat back then!Great this is coming to DVD.",5,'THERE IS NO FRIGATE . . .'

1095889,AYZV1PJP6NXPT,B000UPMZ0I,"R. Long ""JaminRebel""","[2, 6]","I recently stumbled across Sandy Dennis in an episode of The Fugitive in Season one. Sandy was just so stunningly attractive in her prime. She was literally captivating. Based on that episode of The Fugitive I looked up some Sandy Dennis movies. I found ""Up The Down Staircase"" and ""The Fox"". I just watched ""Up The Down Staircase"" last night. The movie was a delight. The movie was so seamless and well acted to where I felt like I was watching a tv show. To know that this show was only a movie was the real disappointment of it all. I wanted more. In 1967 when ""Staircase"" came out I was only four years old. So I obviously saw this movie, or parts of it, later as an older child. Whatever the case the seeds of Sandy Dennis's BEAUTY was planted in my mind long ago. And Ms. Dennis, who never married, was a lot more than just physical beauty, she could act as well. I am looking forward to seeing ""The Fox"" as well. In this latter movie Dennis lives with another woman in a cabin. One of them dies at the end when a tree falls on her. The plot is slyly of a man coming between two women who were probably in love. The fox was sort of symptomatic of something being wrong in this relationship, or that it couldn't or probably wouldn't work out. The cancer in this relationship started as a fox who was killing chickens. The cancer later became a man. Call it what you want to but the movie was about a man coming between two women sort of ending a lesbian love affair. Sadly though it doesn't seem that there are a lot of Sandy Dennis movies with the actress in a leading role. In the case of simple romance movies I'd have to say those aren't that entertaining to me. Anyway, check this movie out because Sandy Dennis is a delight.",5,Fall in love with your teacher: Sandy Dennis,1325030400,"12 28, 2011",2011,1735,"['recently', 'stumbled', 'Sandy', 'Dennis', 'episode', 'Fugitive', 'Season', 'one', 'Sandy', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'stunningly', 'attractive', 'prime', 'was', 'literally', 'captivating', 'Based', 'episode', 'Fugitive', 'looked', 'up', 'Sandy', 'Dennis', 'movies', 'found', 'Down', 'Staircase', 'Fox', 'just', 'watched', 'Down', 'Staircase', 'last', 'night', 'movie', 'was', 'delight', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'seamless', 'well', 'acted', 'where', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'tv', 'show', 'know', 'show', 'was', 'only', 'movie', 'was', 'real', 'disappointment', 'wanted', 'more', '1967', 'when', 'Staircase', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'only', 'four', 'years', 'old', 'So', 'obviously', 'saw', 'movie', 'parts', 'later', 'older', 'child', 'case', 'seeds', 'Sandy', 'Dennis', 'BEAUTY', 'was', 'planted', 'mind', 'long', 'ago', 'Ms.', 'Dennis', 'who', 'never', 'married', 'was', 'lot', 'more', 'just', 'physical', 'beauty', 'could', 'act', 'as', 'well', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'Fox', 'as', 'well', 'latter', 'movie', 'Dennis', 'woman', 'cabin', 'One', 'end', 'when', 'tree', 'plot', 'slyly', 'man', 'coming', 'two', 'women', 'who', 'were', 'probably', 'love', 'fox', 'was', 'sort', 'symptomatic', 'something', 'being', 'wrong', 'relationship', 'could', ""n't"", 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'cancer', 'relationship', 'started', 'fox', 'who', 'was', 'killing', 'chickens', 'cancer', 'later', 'became', 'man', 'Call', 'want', 'movie', 'was', 'man', 'coming', 'two', 'women', 'sort', 'ending', 'lesbian', 'love', 'affair', 'Sadly', ""n't"", 'seem', 'are', 'lot', 'Sandy', 'Dennis', 'movies', 'actress', 'leading', 'role', 'case', 'simple', 'romance', 'movies', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'are', ""n't"", 'entertaining', 'Anyway', 'check', 'movie', 'out', 'Sandy', 'Dennis', 'delight']",N/A

And there were, indeed, staircases so labeled in order to prevent traffic jams during passing.  There were teachers who were pompous and insensitive and others who were vivacious and caring.  Some became burnt out from never feeling fulfilled.  A few, however, remained inspired.  All this comes to light in this movie, including an administration, which seems more concerned with following meaningless rules than it does with meaningful education.  Sandy Denis looks to me too young to be a teacher, but then again there were many who would ask me for a hall pass during my first couple of years as a teacher.  I was 22 in 1966.

I also read the book by Bel Kaufman when I was in High School. I watched this movie and was reminded as to why I liked it in the first place. This movie should serve as an inspiration to anyone who wants to become a teacher. I know times have changed from since the movie was made in 1967, but the message is still the same: If you are able to get through to at least one student, you are on the right track. We do not give teachers enough credit today, and teachers are not paid nearly enough. Teaching is a profession one has to have a passion for, as did Sylvia Barrett in the movie. Sandy Dennis gave an awesome inspiring performance in the movie. We also get to see Jean Stapleton, Florence Stanley and Sorrell Booke all before they became regulars on tv sitcoms.
