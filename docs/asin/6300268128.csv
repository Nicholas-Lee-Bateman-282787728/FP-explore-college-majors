231949,A1A87TUBBDPMF0,6300268128,"Alex Diaz-Granados ""fardreaming writer""","[6, 6]","In everyone's life, I often think, there is a Summer of '42 (or '52, or '62, and so on....), a time in which we discover the joys and sorrows of growing up...and falling in love. There are hijinks and pranks, jokes and playful insults...and always the bonds of friendship.  But sometimes, in those days of discovery and self-awareness, we feel the angst of that first attraction, the bittersweet highs and lows of falling seriously in love for the first time -- sometimes with the right person, sometimes not.  And of course, we feel the heartbreak of losing that cherished love...wondering what on Earth happened.Based on Herman Raucher's autobiographical novel, Robert Mulligan's 1971 classic is one of those rare coming-of-age movies that stands heads and shoulders above those sex-obsessed, raunchy teen-oriented films (Private Lessons, Meatballs)that were released in later years.  Starring Gary Grimes as Hermie, Jerry Hauser as Oscar, Oliver Conant as Benjie, and featuring the luminous Jennifer O'Neill as Dorothy, this lyrical, hysterically funny and heartbreakingly poignant film will ellicit both laughter and tears from all but the most stone-hearted viewer.Summer of '42's plot revolves around the Terrible Trio of Hermie, Oscy, and Benjie, who live on a small island off the East Coast of the United States.  It's the summer after Pearl Harbor, and all the men of military age are going off to the various fronts to fight the Axis powers. One of these is Dorothy's husband, Pete.For Hermie, this opens up a whole world of possibilities.  For in between all the usual boyish things he's done with Oscy and Benjie (among them, sneaking looks at &quot;dirty books&quot;), he's also fallen deeply in love with Dorothy.  He spends time at her house, making himself useful by bringing in the groceries or helping her fix things...the &quot;how do you like your coffee?&quot; scene is a gem, evoking all those memories of how far we young guys would go to impress that &quot;special&quot; girl.But before this movie fades to black to the strains of Michel Legrand's &quot;The Summer Knows/Theme from Summer of '42,&quot; Hermie will learn that even heaven-sent (in this case, Pete's demise) opportunities come with a heavy price.  Even though Hermie's fondest dream does come true (and the scenes of the preliminaries are among the funniest, particularly the purchase of a condom!), the results are somewhat sobering....and heartbreaking.",5,"Sentimental, funny film will make you laugh, cry....",1064966400,"10 1, 2003",2003,2445,"['everyone', 'life', 'often', 'think', 'Summer', ""'42"", ""'52"", ""'62"", 'so', 'time', 'discover', 'joys', 'sorrows', 'growing', 'up', 'falling', 'love', 'are', 'hijinks', 'pranks', 'jokes', 'playful', 'insults', 'always', 'bonds', 'friendship', 'sometimes', 'days', 'discovery', 'self-awareness', 'feel', 'angst', 'first', 'attraction', 'bittersweet', 'highs', 'lows', 'falling', 'seriously', 'love', 'first', 'time', 'sometimes', 'right', 'person', 'sometimes', 'not', 'course', 'feel', 'heartbreak', 'losing', 'cherished', 'love', 'wondering', 'what', 'Earth', 'happened.Based', 'Herman', 'Raucher', 'autobiographical', 'novel', 'Robert', 'Mulligan', '1971', 'classic', 'one', 'rare', 'coming-of-age', 'movies', 'heads', 'shoulders', 'sex-obsessed', 'raunchy', 'teen-oriented', 'films', 'Private', 'Lessons', 'Meatballs', 'were', 'released', 'later', 'years', 'Starring', 'Gary', 'Grimes', 'Hermie', 'Jerry', 'Hauser', 'Oscar', 'Oliver', 'Conant', 'Benjie', 'featuring', 'luminous', 'Jennifer', ""O'Neill"", 'Dorothy', 'lyrical', 'hysterically', 'funny', 'heartbreakingly', 'poignant', 'film', 'will', 'ellicit', 'laughter', 'tears', 'most', 'stone-hearted', 'viewer.Summer', ""'42"", 'plot', 'Terrible', 'Trio', 'Hermie', 'Oscy', 'Benjie', 'who', 'live', 'small', 'island', 'East', 'Coast', 'United', 'States', 'summer', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'men', 'military', 'age', 'are', 'going', 'various', 'fronts', 'fight', 'Axis', 'powers', 'One', 'Dorothy', 'husband', 'Pete.For', 'Hermie', 'up', 'whole', 'world', 'possibilities', 'usual', 'boyish', 'things', 'done', 'Oscy', 'Benjie', 'sneaking', 'looks', 'quot', 'books', 'quot', 'also', 'fallen', 'deeply', 'love', 'Dorothy', 'time', 'house', 'making', 'useful', 'bringing', 'groceries', 'helping', 'fix', 'things', 'quot', 'how', 'do', 'coffee', 'quot', 'scene', 'gem', 'evoking', 'memories', 'how', 'far', 'young', 'guys', 'would', 'go', 'impress', 'quot', 'special', 'quot', 'movie', 'black', 'strains', 'Michel', 'Legrand', 'quot', 'Summer', 'Knows/Theme', 'Summer', ""'42"", 'quot', 'Hermie', 'will', 'learn', 'even', 'heaven-sent', 'case', 'Pete', 'demise', 'come', 'heavy', 'price', 'Even', 'Hermie', 'fondest', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'scenes', 'preliminaries', 'are', 'funniest', 'particularly', 'purchase', 'condom', 'results', 'are', 'somewhat', 'sobering', '.and', 'heartbreaking']",Summer of 42 VHS

Now, nearly three decades later, having seen it again, the movie has lost none of its sense of wonder and pathos. Jennifer O'Neil has to be one of the most sultry women ever to have graced the screen in the 70s. Her beauty and sex appeal are more evident than ever in this decently remastered DVD. The melancholic love theme will resonate long after the movie's over. And the 2 main characters, who live on the fringes of mainstream society, start a romance that just cannot be sustained. His a teenager and she's a married woman. Their parting is always imminent. But knowing that midway through the movie does nothing to diminish its watchability. In fact, that makes it even more rivetting. This movie does not pale in comparison to Casablanca. At times, it's even better than that well-known Bogart classic. It's really about 2 very lonely souls who find comfort in each other's arms. A more recent treatment of this theme is found in Sofia Coppola's equally admirable Oscar-winner, Lost in Translation. But in Summer of '42, lies something more deeply rewarding for the audience who's watching it today. There is an all-consuming nostalgia that envelopes you because this is a highly original love story that came from a time when innocence and sexuality could blend together with a sweet, melancholic afterglow. One of the best romantic movies ever made. You can watch it over and over again.

231954,A417ZAKGXT9IN,6300268128,Betty June Moore,"[98, 104]","It is the summer after Pearl Harbor. The world is at war, and America is sending her best, strongest and healthiest men to fight overseas. Meanwhile, those too young, old, or physically disabled to serve stay behind, as well as wives and sweethearts. Among these are Hermie, Oscy, and Benjie (Gary Grimes, Jerry Houser and Oliver Conant). Together, this &quot;terrible trio&quot; raids the Coast Guard station, frolics on the beach on Packett Island, and sneaks looks at &quot;dirty pictures&quot; from a medical book.But even as the three friends goof around on lazy summer days, the war's effects will soon touch the more serious and sensitive 15-year-old Hermie. He finds himself falling in love with the beautiful Dorothy (Jennifer O'Neill), who is seven years older and married. He worships her from afar, enduring both his friends' merciless teasing and his own confusion about his feelings.But when Dorothy's husband Pete goes overseas to enter the fray, Hermie befriends Dorothy, helping her with chores such as carrying her groceries to her house on the beach and placing boxes in the attic.At the same time, the more rambunctious Oscy (and Hermie's best friend) is trying very hard to pick up girls and lose his virginity, and he makes it his mission in life to help Hermie do the same. So he copies information from a medical book that Benjie says &quot;belongs to the house&quot; where he spends the summer. Oscy also attempts to set up a date for the &quot;terrible trio&quot; at the movies, but that almost falls apart when Benjie and the third girl don't want to go. I don't want to give away what happens next, but it's pretty funny.But the heart of the movie revolves, as many reviewers have said, around Hermie's love for Dorothy, and how he comes to manhood unexpectedly when Dorothy finds out that her husband has been killed in action. It's a beautiful, discreet and bittersweet sequence, and will leave the viewer with indelible memories of a haunting, timeless experience.I like Summer of '42 because it is sweet and gentle, hilarious at times, and always very touching. Michel Legrand's Oscar-winning score is simple yet evocative, and Herman Raucher's screenplay was later adapted by the writer into a best selling novel. I recommend this film to young and old alike as a fine example of what a coming-of-age movie should be like.",5,"Summer of '42 is a timeless, haunting love story........",1073260800,"01 5, 2004",2004,2355,"['summer', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'world', 'war', 'America', 'sending', 'best', 'strongest', 'healthiest', 'men', 'fight', 'overseas', 'Meanwhile', 'too', 'young', 'old', 'physically', 'disabled', 'serve', 'stay', 'behind', 'as', 'well', 'wives', 'sweethearts', 'are', 'Hermie', 'Oscy', 'Benjie', 'Gary', 'Grimes', 'Jerry', 'Houser', 'Oliver', 'Conant', 'Together', 'quot', 'terrible', 'trio', 'quot', 'Coast', 'Guard', 'station', 'frolics', 'beach', 'Packett', 'Island', 'sneaks', 'quot', 'dirty', 'quot', 'medical', 'book.But', 'even', 'three', 'friends', 'goof', 'lazy', 'summer', 'days', 'war', 'effects', 'will', 'soon', 'touch', 'more', 'serious', 'sensitive', '15-year-old', 'Hermie', 'falling', 'love', 'beautiful', 'Dorothy', 'Jennifer', ""O'Neill"", 'who', 'seven', 'years', 'older', 'married', 'afar', 'enduring', 'friends', 'merciless', 'teasing', 'own', 'confusion', 'feelings.But', 'when', 'Dorothy', 'husband', 'Pete', 'overseas', 'enter', 'fray', 'Hermie', 'Dorothy', 'helping', 'chores', 'such', 'carrying', 'groceries', 'house', 'beach', 'placing', 'boxes', 'attic.At', 'same', 'time', 'more', 'rambunctious', 'Oscy', 'Hermie', 'best', 'friend', 'trying', 'very', 'hard', 'pick', 'up', 'girls', 'lose', 'virginity', 'mission', 'life', 'help', 'Hermie', 'do', 'same', 'information', 'medical', 'book', 'Benjie', 'quot', 'house', 'quot', 'where', 'summer', 'Oscy', 'also', 'set', 'up', 'date', 'quot', 'terrible', 'trio', 'quot', 'movies', 'almost', 'falls', 'apart', 'when', 'Benjie', 'third', 'girl', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'what', 'next', 'pretty', 'heart', 'movie', 'many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'Hermie', 'love', 'Dorothy', 'how', 'manhood', 'unexpectedly', 'when', 'Dorothy', 'out', 'husband', 'been', 'killed', 'action', 'beautiful', 'discreet', 'bittersweet', 'sequence', 'will', 'leave', 'viewer', 'indelible', 'memories', 'haunting', 'timeless', 'experience.I', 'Summer', ""'42"", 'sweet', 'gentle', 'hilarious', 'times', 'always', 'very', 'touching', 'Michel', 'Legrand', 'Oscar-winning', 'score', 'simple', 'yet', 'evocative', 'Herman', 'Raucher', 'screenplay', 'was', 'later', 'adapted', 'writer', 'best', 'selling', 'novel', 'recommend', 'film', 'young', 'old', 'alike', 'fine', 'example', 'what', 'coming-of-age', 'movie', 'should', 'be']",Summer of 42 VHS
231955,A1LKBVKBHII5T5,6300268128,"BluesDuke ""A sacred cow is worth but one thin...","[5, 5]","In 1971, when Herman Raucher's only-too-autobiographical film was released, it was easy to love . . . and easy to fear that it wouldn't stand the test of time. In part because of a few thousand more lame and less literate coming-of-heartbreaking-age films since, and in part because it's written and played with a humane grace (if you can call the clumsy surety of Jerry Houser's Oscar and Christopher Norris's Miriam, and even Oliver Conant's exposed-nerve nerd Benjie graceful) long since too rare in this subgenre, this film defies that fear.I know of no coming-of-age film before or since that explores what might have been a testosterone-lubricated cliche with the unexaggerated realism and romanticism this film still evinces. It becomes even more haunting when you realise Raucher a) changed no names (this was indeed his summer of 1942; Oscy and Bengie were, indeed, his real-life best friends; and, Dorothy was only too real in his life), b) changed only a few small details around; and, c) in due course heard from the real-life Dorothy with whom he really did have what began as an unrequitable love and ended as the heartbreaking sexual interlude between an earnest teenage boy and a suddenly-widowed war bride. (She contacted him after the film's success, hoping their encounter hadn't damaged him psychologically.)Iif you're looking for such a film with this respectful a portrayal of unrequitable love intertwined with unexpected and untenable sexuality, you're going to have a very long hunt for a very small needle in a very impossible volume of haystacks. There is probably no more heartbreaking climax of transient fulfillment than when Gary Grimes (a Golden Globe winner as Best Newcomer) as earnest, intelligent, awkwardly sensitive Hermie---who has fallen genuinely in love with (he thinks) the unattainable---finds his quiet imaginings brought to bittersweet reality. And there is probably no more nostalgia-obliterating, tastefully-arresting eroticism in film than that of Jennifer O'Neill's likeable, accessible-to-a-point war bride Dorothy reduced to vulnerable, softly hungering widowhood by the ravage of war, though it remains a very open question as to which moment therein is the more affecting: the sweetly surreal imagery of Dorothy about to bed Hermie through opaque, wind-billowed curtains; or, the near-noirish moment that precedes it, when she clings to him in her grief and he manages strangely but empathetically to feel hers, shamelessly letting a tear ride its track down his face (if Grimes let himself be that genuinely lost that deeply in the moment it's one of the greatest pieces of acting by a teenager---he was exactly as old making the film as Raucher was when he had his own Dorothy---in film history), orchestrated harrowingly by the scratchy playing of the film's theme music in a version spearheaded by a cliche-defying tenor saxophone howling hopelessly through a recessed orchestra.There are certain cutouts punctuating the story, particularly Hermie's unseen mother, who may be a fleeting presence for the sake of the focus but who seems far more wooden and soulless than parents in that time and place really were (Maureen Stapleton interject the periodic hails as the mother); and, the incidental Aggie (Katherine Allentuck, Stapleton's real-life daughter), who shares Hermie's earnestness and gentle clumsiness but isn't allowed much more than a brief hint of the depth she hints at sharing with him despite his nervous disinterest and swelling conflict with the cavalier Oscy and Miriam. But these seem more to be signposts rather than obstructions along the romantically tragic path traveled by the struggling Hermie and the endearing Dorothy.Disregard the cinematic flaws (as in, catching Hermie's breath outside the drugstore in the middle of summer, Dorothy's house somehow disappearing during a walk on the beach that must have been some lap around that island, the 1970s-style Rice Krispies box among the debris when Dorothy drops her groceries, the playing of ""Now, Voyager"" in the moviehouse scene---a film that wasn't released until after the summer of 1942) and take in a film that becomes more haunting when you realise that Raucher remembered and sketched his Dorothy with a respect you probably wouldn't expect to see or feel from another writer. (Or filmmaker, counting Robert Mulligan's Golden Globe-winning direction.)Which is pretty damn singular for a film that began as Raucher's bid to write a tribute to his real-life friend Oscar Seltzer (who really was killed in action during the subsequent Korean War), became a tribute to his heartbreaking first love midway through its writing (ok, so he was a year younger in reality than he portrays Hermie---which would get Dorothy arrested and Hermie in court-ordered counseling if it had happened these days), and landed him an Oscar for best factual screenplay and Michel Legrand an Oscar for that impossibly ubiquitous yet unobstrusive music.If only it could have been a career maker for one and all. It sort of was for Jennifer O'Neill, who went on to a mostly-television career about which you could say she has rarely been long out of work if almost never quite so memorable. (These days, the much-bruised O'Neill---whose promising ""Cover-Up"" series aborted when co-star Jon-Erik Hexum in a gun accident---is a quietly committed pro-life activist among other activities.) It sort of was for Christopher Norris, who arrived soon enough as ""Trapper John, M.D.'s"" earnest former sexpot nurse, Gloria Brancuzzi, for about five seasons, before playing one of ""Santa Barbara's"" vapid vixens and ultimately retiring from acting, for the most part (she was often mistaken for Melanie Griffith, who resembles her strikingly), and earning a psychology degree. It sort of was for Jerry Houser, who's made an even more active character-acting career in film (notably ""Slap Shot"") and television.For Gary Grimes, alas, it was the opening to a sporadic career that seems to have stopped as of 1991. And, except for Oliver Conant's signing on to make the badly ill-advised, badly-executed sequel, ""Class of '44,"" neither he nor Katherine Allentuck ever again appeared on film or in television.Herman Raucher, one of whose earlier plays had been contorted into the Elvis Presley mishap ""Follow That Dream,"" had another of his screenplays contorted into a mishap: ""Sweet November,"" which he wrote in 1968, but which---transmuted into a farcical romantic tragedy by a screewriter and storywriter (adapting and melding therein an earlier Italian film) whose brains had clearly gone to bed (and not the way Dorothy escorted Hermie, either)---landed nothing but three Razzie nominations.

231961,A19PHVY41E0XSU,6300268128,Dr. O'Boogie,"[0, 0]","Before George Lucas gave us a nostalgic ride with American Graffiti, there was this ""coming of age"" classic based on the memoirs of screenwriter Herman Raucher. The story concerns three boys on that summer during WWII corousing around on the New England resort island of Nantucket (called Packett Island for the film), Hermie, Oscy and Benji. Hermie, of course is Raucher who's character narrates. The ""terrible trio"" as they call themselves, raid the Coast Guard station and just plain hang-out at the beach with girls and sex on their minds. Hermie and Oscy make their mission to lose their virginity while Benji, the youngest of the 3 bows out.Basically the central core of the film is Hermie's relationship with a beautiful local newlywed woman named Dorothy who's husband has gone off to fight in the war. He helps her with her groceries and in a hilarious bit helps her load boxes into her attic. She's wearing a halter-top and shorts and Hermie can barely control himself on the step ladder. The funniest moment has him going into the local drugstore to purchase condoms:Clerk: How many do you want?Hermie: About 3 dozen.Clerk: Planning on a big night, huh?Hermie: They're for my brother, he's older.Clerk: Why can't he get them himself?Hermie: He's sick!Clerk: Then what does he need them for?! Son, do you know what these are used for?Hermie: Sure, you fill them up with water and throw them off the roof.Clerk: OK, I just wanted to make sure you knew.However, things turn more serious later on when Hermie shows up at Dorothy's to find out that just earlier she was notified that her husband was killed in action in France. Hermie offers comfort for her and the two go off to bed to make love. The scene is done tastfully without being exploitive and Jennifer O'Neil turns in a great performance expressing sadness, confusion and loneliness all at the same time. Almost no dialoge is used throughout this scene except for a simple ""goodnight Hermie"" from Dorothy as he leaves. Hermie comes back the next day to find that she has left the island and left him a note wishing him the best and that he doesn't have to endure life's tragedies like she did.The characters are very well drawn out. The film focuses on the different perspectives each member of the trio have on sex. Hermie is the more sensitive romantic type, this is evident when he chooses not to tell Oscy or Benji any details of his relationship with Dorothy. Hermie takes his feelings for her very seriously and keeps them private despite the badgering from the other 2. The oafish Oscy, on the other hand, is quite the opposite. He looks at sex as nothing but fun and games and a way to measure manhood. He has no quirks at all about telling all the details of the sexual adventure he had with a girl named Miriam who was part of a double-date he and Hermie went on (being obsessed with the older woman, Hermie passed on the other girl, Aggie.) Nerdy Benji as stated before was the youngest of the 3 and looked at sex as a curiosity but still somewhat ""yucky"".The film was a major success and earned an Oscar nomination for best original screenplay. Raucher wrote a novel version after the film was completed but was published before the film's release. So, many thought that the film was based on the novel. In the wake of it's success, Raucher, who narrates that he never saw Dorothy again or heard what became of her, received many letters from women claiming to be his Dorothy. However, one letter did include details only she would've known, plus he recognized her handwriting. She wrote that she was carrying guilt for years that she may have traumatized Hermie, but was glad to find out that everything turned out fine.I first saw this film on network television in 1973 and thought it was great despite some mild editing. And being 16 at the time, there was no doubt about the crush me and the countless male teens at the time had on the very lovely Jennifer O'Neil. Certainly one of the best ""coming of age"" films of the times. A follow-up sequel called Class of '44 came along a few years later and bombed bigtime at the box office.

The film actually was made before the book was written. Many think it was adapted from the book, but that is not the case. Warner Brothers asked Raucher to pen a book based on the film. The book was released before the film and as many of you remember it was one of the best selling books of the early 1970's. It seems as time goes on I relate less to Hermie as a boy, but to Hermie as a man narrating the melancholy look back on his life. Let's not forget the musical score by Michel Legrand... the music is as beautiful as Jennifer O'Neill, who is so free spirited that she created more of a woman from the 70's than the 1940's character she portrays... but it works wonderfully. The blend of drama and comedy works so subtly which I feel is what absorbs you into the films mood. The humor is based on teenage awkwardness and when filming they kept Jennifer O'Neill away from the three boys, so the awkwardness was always fresh.

I saw Summer of 42, 30+ years ago in downtown Chicago. So I rented it this time.Three 15 year old buddies are vacationing in the first summer of World WarII on, what may be Martha's Vinyard or, some other Cape Cod island. They are with their families but you never see them. Hermie, Oscy & Benji are hormone fueled & determined to lose their virginity that summer. They even have a book that tells them how. Oscy: "" Foreplay! You have to play foreplay!""Hermie has a crush & he's got it bad. He's in love with an ""older"" married woman who has just seen her husband off to war. Jennifer O'Neill as Dorothy is stunning & sexy & really nice in this rustic setting. She is lonely & so is Hermie in that way that most teenagers are. He helps her with her groceries one day & from that they become good friends.Meanwhile, Oscy is studying the book & hard at work hooking up with Mariam, a local girl. He also tries to fix Hermie up with Miriam's girlfriend, Aggie. The scene in which Hermie goes to the drugstore to buy condoms is classic & may be this movie's claim to fame. Later, that night Oscy gets his & is devoured by the demure but ravenous Mariam. She apparently does things to Oscy the book never mentioned. He needs all of Hermie's rubbers.The next day Dorothy gets a ""we regret to inform you letter.""Her husband has been killed. Hermie has a ""date"" with her & discovers the bad news. She seeks comfort with Hermie. He may be the only friend she has on the island. Then it happens. The  love scene is tasteful & lingering. There is no overt nudity in this movie. Hermie & Oscy both lose their innocence but in very different ways. Oscy is happy & life goes on. Hermie is introspective & somehow changed. The next day Dorothy is gone & leaves Hermie a letter.

Gelwasser,"[8, 8]","When your asked to name the great romantic films of the '70s inevitably titles such as the ""The Way We Were"" and the much maligned ""Love Story"" come to mind. But most lists always seem to unfairly leave off the wonderful, Robert Mulligan film, ""The Summer of '42"".""The Summer of '42"" was a big box office hit, way back in '71, but now seems to be rarely mentioned or even remembered.Well, I've always loved this somewhat, overly sentimental,'coming of age' story and was overjoyed to find it had come out on DVD.The story takes place during the WWII era on a wind swept, U.S. island, where families go to the beach to escape the summer heat. The episodic film focuses on some fifteen year old boys, who are basically dying of boredom and behaving like average teenagers.The pushy and rather obnoxious, Oscy (Jerry Houser) spends most of the movie try to figure out 'how' and 'when' he'll get sex.Romance dosn't exactly figure too much into his carnal plans.Then there is Hermie (Garry Grimes), who is the exact opposite. He honestly falls in love with a beautiful (but older) warbride named Dorothy (Jennifer O'Neill), who dosn't seem to realize how deep his infatuation is. Eventually the war comes home and tragedy strikes the young women.Hermie is there for Dorothy in her time of need and in the process loses both his virginity and a bit of innocence. Yes, I know this all sounds pretty smaltzy and something out of a pulp romance novel.But to tell you the truth the film really works! Director, Robert Mulligan and screen writer Herman Raucher have combined thier talents to create a movie, which is equal parts nostalgia, romance and in some scenes even humorus (I love the drugstore/condom scene!).The sexual denouement of the film is handled beautifully and with discretion. I love the fact that during the almost silent 5 minute scene you hear nothing on the soundtrack, but an old scratchy record that plays out to it's end groove.What atmosphere!The rest of the film actually has a classic, Oscar winning, romantic score by Michael Legrande, which just sticks in your head and won't let go.If you are interested in seeing a wonderful 'coming of age' story then I highly recommend ""The Summer of '42"".",5,One of the Great Romantic Films of the 1970's,1067817600,"11 3, 2003",2003,2212,"['When', 'asked', 'name', 'great', 'romantic', 'films', ""'70s"", 'inevitably', 'such', 'Way', 'Were', 'much', 'maligned', 'Love', 'Story', 'come', 'mind', 'most', 'lists', 'always', 'seem', 'unfairly', 'leave', 'off', 'wonderful', 'Robert', 'Mulligan', 'film', 'Summer', ""'42"", 'Summer', ""'42"", 'was', 'big', 'box', 'office', 'hit', 'way', 'back', ""'71"", 'now', 'be', 'rarely', 'mentioned', 'even', 'remembered.Well', ""'ve"", 'always', 'loved', 'somewhat', 'overly', 'sentimental', ""'coming"", 'age', 'story', 'was', 'overjoyed', 'find', 'had', 'come', 'out', 'DVD.The', 'story', 'place', 'WWII', 'era', 'wind', 'swept', 'U.S.', 'island', 'where', 'families', 'go', 'beach', 'escape', 'summer', 'heat', 'episodic', 'film', 'focuses', 'fifteen', 'year', 'old', 'boys', 'who', 'are', 'basically', 'dying', 'boredom', 'behaving', 'like', 'average', 'teenagers.The', 'pushy', 'rather', 'obnoxious', 'Oscy', 'Jerry', 'Houser', 'most', 'movie', 'try', 'figure', 'out', ""'how"", ""'ll"", 'get', 'sex.Romance', 'dos', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'figure', 'too', 'much', 'carnal', 'plans.Then', 'Hermie', 'Garry', 'Grimes', 'who', 'exact', 'opposite', 'honestly', 'love', 'beautiful', 'older', 'warbride', 'named', 'Dorothy', 'Jennifer', ""O'Neill"", 'who', 'dos', ""n't"", 'seem', 'realize', 'how', 'deep', 'infatuation', 'Eventually', 'war', 'home', 'tragedy', 'strikes', 'young', 'women.Hermie', 'there', 'Dorothy', 'time', 'need', 'process', 'virginity', 'bit', 'innocence', 'Yes', 'know', 'pretty', 'smaltzy', 'something', 'pulp', 'romance', 'novel.But', 'tell', 'truth', 'film', 'really', 'Director', 'Robert', 'Mulligan', 'screen', 'writer', 'Herman', 'Raucher', 'have', 'combined', 'thier', 'talents', 'create', 'movie', 'equal', 'parts', 'nostalgia', 'romance', 'scenes', 'even', 'humorus', 'love', 'drugstore/condom', 'scene', '.The', 'sexual', 'denouement', 'film', 'handled', 'beautifully', 'discretion', 'love', 'fact', 'almost', 'silent', '5', 'minute', 'scene', 'hear', 'nothing', 'soundtrack', 'old', 'scratchy', 'record', 'out', 'end', 'groove.What', 'atmosphere', 'rest', 'film', 'actually', 'classic', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'romantic', 'score', 'Michael', 'Legrande', 'just', 'sticks', 'head', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'go.If', 'are', 'interested', 'seeing', 'wonderful', ""'coming"", 'age', 'story', 'then', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Summer', ""'42""]",Summer of 42 VHS

Those that are upset about the age difference and the supposed ""sexual exploitation"" of a teen boy at the hands of an older woman miss a couple of points: first, this was 70 years ago.  Mores and times were quite different then, so I don't see how we can judge the actions of the participants this many years removed from the time frame.  Second and more important, I didn't see this as sexual at all.  In fact, it's haunting in its beauty, as far as I'm concerned.  Hermie is offering solace to a woman who befriended him and who has lost her husband in WWII; the sex is secondary.  To me, it seemed that Dorothy had, because of her overwhelming grief, put Hermie in the place of her husband that night (she had just received the telegram informing her of her husband's death), imagining that he was there with her, not this young boy.  She is never going to touch and make love with her husband again.  Reaching out in this way to Hermie was, in my opinion, an attempt at one last contact, however bizarre that may seem to others now.  Unless we've walked in the shoes of others, we shouldn't judge.  We don't know how we're going to act until it happens to us.  A touching and sad story definitely worth watching.

The boys, Gary Grimes, and friends see her across the sand dunes as a sex object.

In Melina and the earlier Paridisio, the sexuality of young teens is the topic of wistful nostalgia.Filmed in 1971, this island is fine for 1940's beach houses, so add a few 1930's cars and bobby soxer clothing and we have a lovely recreation.  The boys want to do it, calculating whether their Saturday night date will allow further experimentation. Grimes, a handsome, but naive teen has been hanging around, doing odd jobs for O'Neill.

231998,A1N441OPDOIL3T,6300268128,R.L.,"[2, 2]","This movie really happened. It is based on the real life experience of Herman Raucher, who wrote the screenplay, and then the book, in that order. Raucher is ""Hermie"" in the movie, and this experience happened to him in the summer of 1942 at Nantucket Island, off Cape Cod. There was a real Dorothy, and he had a brief affair with her following the death of her young Army Air force husband. His friend Oscy was also real, and he died about 10 years later.The movie, of course, was a huge hit, and made Jennifer O'Neill, who played Dorothy, a star. Michel Legrand's song, ""Summer me, Winter me"" also became a big hit.After the movie was released in 1971, Raucher received a letter from the real Dorothy. She told him about her life after she left Nantucket, remarried, etc. with three grandchildren. She thanked him for filling a void at the time of her despair. Unlike the movie, she kept referring to him as her husband ""Pete"" the night they made love. The movie scene, when young Hermie finds the telegram and makes love to her in tears is one of the most moving I have ever seen--something you never forget.There was no return address on the letter Dorothy sent to Raucher, and he never saw or heard from her again.",5,It Really Happened,1375574400,"08 4, 2013",2013,1219,"['movie', 'really', 'happened', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'experience', 'Herman', 'Raucher', 'who', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'then', 'book', 'order', 'Raucher', 'Hermie', 'movie', 'experience', 'happened', 'summer', '1942', 'Nantucket', 'Island', 'off', 'Cape', 'Cod', 'was', 'real', 'Dorothy', 'had', 'brief', 'affair', 'following', 'death', 'young', 'Army', 'Air', 'force', 'husband', 'friend', 'Oscy', 'was', 'also', 'real', 'died', '10', 'years', 'later.The', 'movie', 'course', 'was', 'huge', 'hit', 'made', 'Jennifer', ""O'Neill"", 'who', 'played', 'Dorothy', 'star', 'Michel', 'Legrand', 'song', 'Summer', 'Winter', 'also', 'became', 'big', 'hit.After', 'movie', 'was', 'released', '1971', 'Raucher', 'received', 'letter', 'real', 'Dorothy', 'told', 'life', 'left', 'Nantucket', 'remarried', 'etc', 'three', 'grandchildren', 'thanked', 'filling', 'void', 'time', 'despair', 'movie', 'kept', 'referring', 'husband', 'Pete', 'night', 'made', 'love', 'movie', 'scene', 'when', 'young', 'Hermie', 'telegram', 'love', 'tears', 'one', 'most', 'moving', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'something', 'never', 'was', 'return', 'address', 'letter', 'Dorothy', 'sent', 'Raucher', 'never', 'saw', 'heard', 'again']",Summer of 42 VHS
231999,A2MQOHS98BLAUV,6300268128,R. P. Jones,"[0, 2]","Summer of '42 would have been a much better film if it had dealt more seriously with its central theme.  Many reviewers who refer to the film as a beautiful love story or a touching romance are responding, I suspect, to the lovely cinematography and to Michel Legrand's evocative music.  Certainly, both of these elements wrap the film in a warm glow, like the pretty picture on the front of a greeting card.  The problem is when we open the greeting card only to find a dirty joke written on the inside.  Indeed, when the soft piano is not playing, and we are not watching waves crash on the seashore, the sun setting over the dunes, or looking at lovely slow-motion shots of Jennifer O'Neill, Summer of '42 plays like an early version of Porky's.The late Roger Ebert (who disliked the film) correctly laments the many contradictions that weigh the film down:  the thoughts and feelings of a 14-year old boy being re-told and re-imagined by an adult narrator, the wistful ""days of old"" nostalgia contrasted with the sexual frankness of a much later time, the sudden restraint of the final, key ""love"" scene against the unrestrained crudeness of the earlier sex-and-rubbers exchanges, which clearly aim for easy laughs that are completely out of character with the aforementioned Hallmark card-like narrative.  The film tries to work (using characters who are barely teenagers) both as sex comedy and as sentimental romance, and in so doing fails to work as either.Dorothy disappears from the film just as she entered it: as a vision, an enigma, an object of feminine beauty.  As adults, we understand her intimacy with Hermie as a momentary emotional need in the face of grief, but did Hermie ever understand this?  We don't know.And what becomes of the oafish Oscy?  Most of us probably knew guys like this, who regarded girls as playthings and the sex act as something akin to a satisfying bowel movement.  These are the guys who often go on to a life of destructive self-indulgence, of sexual misadventures and emotional disconnection.Thus I state my contention that the real theme of Summer of '42 is not love or romance but the tragedy of kids growing up too fast.  Of sexual preoccupations and adult losses intruding upon young minds ill-equipped to understand or interpret them.

Barrows,"[3, 8]","I just had to get this movie just so I could remember it from when I first saw it at the movies in the early 70s and to see the similarites from the movie The Inkwell (1994). Even my youngest daughter noticed the similarities watching it by herself. The only differences are; when the setting took place in the summer of 1942 from 1976, Nantucket Island from Martha's Vineyard, not white but African American. Both young teen males lost their virginity to older married woman, Summer of 42 she lost her husband in the war; The Inkwell, the husband was cheating on her, both women are sad and found comfort in these young men. The Inkwell being a little more funnier, Summer of 42 was still GOOD, SAD and SWEET (like another person puts it)and had some funny scenes too. Like Hermie going to the Drug Store trying to buy condoms (rubbers, hahah!!) and Oscy (Hermie's best friend)trying desperately to get his 1st lay and trying to follow instructions from a Medical book on foreplay leading to sex and exceeding it...haha!! Also Summer of 42 the possibilites of that happening to a normal young man was more realistic. In The Inkwell Lorenz Tate's character was a too weird and awkward teenage boy almost like Benji, Hermie's other best friend who was just too shy to be with girls his own age.

232001,A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ,6300268128,Sean Pasek,"[0, 0]","Based on the biographical novel by Herman Raucher, the film is able to capture the time and feelings of a teenage boy dealing with new feelings as he discovers that he has a powerful attraction toward a young woman who is seven years his senior.  Perhaps one of the things that makes this such a compelling story is the writer's brutal honesty about his thoughts and feelings.  The author himself captures this very idea with his words that are used in the opening part of the film:""Nothing from that first day I saw her, and no one that has happened to me since, has ever been as frightening and as confusing. For no person I've ever known has ever done more to make me feel more sure, more insecure, more important, and less significant.""I think many people have had the new, fresh experience of a young teenager who has developed feelings for someone that doesn't seem to make sense, and yet you can't just ignore those feelings either.Hermie is a young boy spending his summer on the island of Nantucket.  He spends his days with best friends Oscy and Benjie.  As fifteen-year-old boys, they discover and powerful curiosity into the world of sex.  They even talk Benjie into swiping his parents' medical book so they can ""see and learn how it's done.""  Hermie is just as curious as his friends, but then something happens.  He finds himself infatuated by the young 22-year-old woman living in a house on the beach with her husband who is shipping off to Europe during WWII.  Somehow, because we don't see much of her husband, we already figure this a prelude of events to come.Hermie is teased by his friends when they learn of his infatuation, and he doesn't take it well.  It's almost as if he views their snide comments as an attack on her as well as him.  Perhaps this is because, like many first-time loves, it is special to him; perhaps even sacred.He starts by watching her from afar and perhaps dreaming of what it would be like to be with her.  At first, she's just an image, until he finally meets her by helping to carry her groceries home.  We quickly find that she is a very sweet, down-to-earth girl who genuinely likes Hermie, even if it isn't the same type of ""like.""  She welcomes his companionship, as it appears that she doesn't have any other friends on the island.  She sunbathes alone and goes to the movies alone.  And she treats Hermie very nicely even when he finds himself stumbling over his comments to her.  She never laughs or makes fun of him.Their relationship is handled much like a dream.  We don't even find out the girl's name until the last part of the film.  It's as if the experience has come and gone, and the writer almost has to wonder if it really happened at all.  And yet, this type of experience that is captured so powerfully in this film, works because most viewers can relate to some degree.Something tragic occurs that allows for Hermie and the girl to come together at last.  However, it isn't in any way that perhaps we expect, which reflects Hermie's experience as well.  He's at her house, and his intention is simply to be there for her.  And although he doesn't realize it at such a young age, his act is healing kind of love that she desperately needs which makes the scene all the more poignant and beautiful.  It's almost as if that was his whole purpose for being in her life for the short span of time of one summer.The performances in this film are very good.  Jerry Houser plays Oscy in such a way that we like him even if he's annoying at times.  He's simply a friend who doesn't yet get it because he hasn't matured yet.Hermie is played very well by Gary Grimes who is able to use subtle facial expressions to capture the confusion as well as the genuine feelings of a 15-year-old boy in love for the first time.Of course, we can't mention performances without Jennifer O'Neill.  She plays the girl with a graceful, sweet style that captured the hearts of many young boys at the time this film came out and obviously makes the film work.The Oscar winning music from this film must also be mentioned.  It also seems to sing of sweetness and innocence as two souls come together to give each other what the other needed at that time.  We find that love, tenderness, and sweetness of experience is in the moment that comes without planning or expectations.  In short, it is a true moment of love.",5,"An Eloquent Film of Style, Beauty & Timeless Grace",1203811200,"02 24, 2008",2008,4361,"['Based', 'biographical', 'novel', 'Herman', 'Raucher', 'film', 'able', 'capture', 'time', 'feelings', 'teenage', 'boy', 'dealing', 'new', 'feelings', 'powerful', 'attraction', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'seven', 'years', 'senior', 'Perhaps', 'one', 'things', 'such', 'compelling', 'story', 'writer', 'brutal', 'honesty', 'thoughts', 'feelings', 'author', 'very', 'idea', 'words', 'are', 'used', 'opening', 'part', 'film', 'Nothing', 'first', 'day', 'saw', 'one', 'happened', 'ever', 'been', 'frightening', 'confusing', 'person', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'known', 'ever', 'done', 'more', 'make', 'feel', 'more', 'sure', 'more', 'insecure', 'more', 'important', 'less', 'significant', 'think', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'had', 'new', 'fresh', 'experience', 'young', 'teenager', 'who', 'developed', 'feelings', 'someone', ""n't"", 'seem', 'make', 'sense', 'yet', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'ignore', 'feelings', 'either.Hermie', 'young', 'boy', 'spending', 'summer', 'island', 'Nantucket', 'days', 'best', 'friends', 'Oscy', 'Benjie', 'fifteen-year-old', 'boys', 'discover', 'powerful', 'curiosity', 'world', 'sex', 'even', 'talk', 'Benjie', 'swiping', 'parents', 'medical', 'book', 'can', 'see', 'learn', 'how', 'done', 'Hermie', 'just', 'as', 'curious', 'friends', 'then', 'something', 'happens', 'infatuated', 'young', '22-year-old', 'woman', 'living', 'house', 'beach', 'husband', 'who', 'shipping', 'off', 'Europe', 'WWII', 'Somehow', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'husband', 'already', 'figure', 'prelude', 'events', 'come.Hermie', 'teased', 'friends', 'when', 'learn', 'infatuation', ""n't"", 'take', 'well', 'almost', 'snide', 'comments', 'attack', 'as', 'well', 'Perhaps', 'because', 'many', 'first-time', 'loves', 'special', 'perhaps', 'even', 'sacred.He', 'starts', 'watching', 'afar', 'perhaps', 'dreaming', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'be', 'first', 'just', 'image', 'finally', 'helping', 'carry', 'groceries', 'home', 'quickly', 'find', 'very', 'sweet', 'down-to-earth', 'girl', 'who', 'genuinely', 'Hermie', 'even', ""n't"", 'same', 'type', 'companionship', ""n't"", 'have', 'other', 'friends', 'island', 'alone', 'movies', 'alone', 'Hermie', 'very', 'nicely', 'even', 'when', 'stumbling', 'comments', 'never', 'fun', 'him.Their', 'relationship', 'handled', 'much', 'dream', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'find', 'out', 'girl', 'name', 'last', 'part', 'film', 'experience', 'come', 'gone', 'writer', 'almost', 'wonder', 'really', 'happened', 'yet', 'type', 'experience', 'captured', 'so', 'powerfully', 'film', 'most', 'viewers', 'can', 'relate', 'degree.Something', 'tragic', 'occurs', 'Hermie', 'girl', 'come', 'together', 'last', 'However', ""n't"", 'way', 'perhaps', 'expect', 'Hermie', 'experience', 'as', 'well', 'house', 'intention', 'simply', 'be', 'there', ""n't"", 'realize', 'young', 'age', 'act', 'healing', 'kind', 'love', 'desperately', 'scene', 'more', 'poignant', 'beautiful', 'almost', 'was', 'whole', 'purpose', 'being', 'life', 'short', 'span', 'time', 'one', 'summer.The', 'performances', 'film', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'Jerry', 'Houser', 'Oscy', 'such', 'way', 'like', 'even', 'annoying', 'times', 'simply', 'friend', 'who', ""n't"", 'yet', 'get', ""n't"", 'matured', 'yet.Hermie', 'played', 'very', 'well', 'Gary', 'Grimes', 'who', 'able', 'use', 'subtle', 'facial', 'expressions', 'capture', 'confusion', 'as', 'well', 'genuine', 'feelings', '15-year-old', 'boy', 'love', 'first', 'time.Of', 'course', 'ca', ""n't"", 'mention', 'performances', 'Jennifer', ""O'Neill"", 'girl', 'graceful', 'sweet', 'style', 'captured', 'hearts', 'many', 'young', 'boys', 'time', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'obviously', 'film', 'work.The', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'music', 'film', 'must', 'also', 'be', 'mentioned', 'also', 'sing', 'sweetness', 'innocence', 'two', 'souls', 'come', 'together', 'give', 'other', 'what', 'other', 'needed', 'time', 'find', 'love', 'tenderness', 'sweetness', 'experience', 'moment', 'planning', 'expectations', 'short', 'true', 'moment', 'love']",Summer of 42 VHS
232002,A38S8RD8XOXLVS,6300268128,"SHAWN JAMES ""Amateur Film critic""","[12, 13]","Robert Mulligan's Summer of `42 poignantly tells the story of Hermie and his friends as they fritter away the summer days looking for love and sex in a beachfront town. I've watched a lot of teen movies in my life (Last American Virgin, Breakfast Club, Can't buy me love, Pretty in Pink, Sixteen Candles, Fast Times at Ridgemont High) and none of them had the moved me emotionally like this film did.Hermie spends his days hanging out with friends and occasionally helping out Dorothy, an older woman whose husband has gone to war. In between the comical teenage hi-jinx (the scene at the movie theatre and the scene where he buys condoms are very funny) Hermie's friendship with Dorothy grows closer. Hermie is in puppy love with Dorothy and maybe it would have remained just that if not for the stunning plot twist near the end of the film. Things come to an unexpected head on the night he goes over to visit her and learns that her husband has died. This leads to one of the most powerful sex scenes ever filmed. Through a set of amazing shots set just to music, Mulligan shows how the sex between Hermie and Dorothy is about emotional vulnerability and wanting to be close to someone. In the tasteful sequence you can feel Hermie's uneasiness about sleeping with Dorothy. When standing on the porch to leave Dorothy's house she says a simple goodnight that speaks volumes. Hermie returns to visit Dorothy the next day and finds a note in the door. Reading it he realizes things in his life are forever changed.Gary Grimes and Jennifer O' Neill give great performances; the chemistry these two actors share makes the film work. The other actors give great performances too, they portray the teens as awkward and curious; the way they talk sounds like teenagers and not like they just got through reading a thesaurus. The set design takes you to the simpler time of 1942 as Mulligan's camerawork tells the story by building tension in just the right scenes. The Oscar-winning score is in the right places and sets just the right mood. If you like teen movies, you must buy this film.

Thankfully, when I did lose my virginity several years later, it was under very beautiful circumstances, and like Hermie, with a woman I loved. In that moment I almost felt sorry for the guys who had lost theirs in meaningless couplings with women they felt nothing for.Sorry to babble, but I just wanted to convey why this very special movie means so much to me, as it obviously does to the many fine reviewers who have written such wonderful and intelligent reviews.I have always loved the work of Michel Legrand and he was the perfect choice for this exquisite soundtrack.I hope young males especially will appreciate this movie and the underlying message that losing your virginity in a shallow, mechanical way is truly meaningless.

We see his  easygoing, innocent and fun-filled existence suddenly bloom into one  involving an awakening and burgeoning awareness of his sexuality. And we  have Dorothy, a young and beautiful woman awaiting her husband's return  from war only to learn of his death.Combine these two kindred spirits -  a boy waking up to his sexual urges and a sad, lonely woman who has just  lost a husband - and we have the centerpiece of a great and sensitive  story.

Then factor in Michel Legrand's  brilliant musical score and we have a giant movie classic.Summer of '42  aptly defines what a good movie should be.",5,Poignant and Unforgettable,949104000,"01 29, 2000",2000,987,"['Emotional', 'poignant', 'sad', 'funny', 'movie', 'ingredients', 'unforgettable', 'tale.Every', 'male', 'adult', 'can', 'surely', 'identify', 'Hermie', 'rapid', 'difficult', 'changes', 'young', 'life', 'thin', 'line', 'separating', 'adolescence', 'adulthood', 'see', 'easygoing', 'innocent', 'fun-filled', 'existence', 'suddenly', 'one', 'involving', 'awakening', 'burgeoning', 'awareness', 'sexuality', 'have', 'Dorothy', 'young', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'awaiting', 'husband', 'return', 'war', 'only', 'learn', 'death.Combine', 'two', 'kindred', 'spirits', 'boy', 'waking', 'up', 'sexual', 'urges', 'sad', 'lonely', 'woman', 'who', 'just', 'lost', 'husband', 'have', 'centerpiece', 'great', 'sensitive', 'story', 'Theirs', 'journey', 'innocence', 'awakening', 'quite', 'similar', 'Bobby', 'Goldsboro', ""'Summer"", 'Then', 'factor', 'Michel', 'Legrand', 'brilliant', 'musical', 'score', 'have', 'giant', 'movie', 'classic.Summer', ""'42"", 'aptly', 'what', 'good', 'movie', 'should', 'be']",Summer of 42 VHS
