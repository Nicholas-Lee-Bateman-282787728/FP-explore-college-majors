1064277,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B000OHZL08,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[19, 20]","Last year, longrunning detective series ""Monk"" (an obsessie-compulsive detective) got paired with the new show, a lighthearted comedy-mystery series about a kooky faux-psychic who solves crimes. Together, these shows are even more delightful, with charmingly eccentric characters and some very nice writing.The fifth season of ""Monk"" opens with a movie about to be made about Monk's (Tony Shalhoub) life and amazing abilities, with well-known actor David Ruskin (Stanley Tucci) as Monk. But Ruskin turns out to be the world's best method actor, as he observes Monk doing his detective work -- and starts to acquire Monk's OCD and personality.But Monk's problems don't cease when he's paralyzed by a garbage strike, and the strike leader is murdered. Other cases include a mysterious electrocution in a gym shower, being blinded by a murderer, a stint as a private eye, a college reunion, a disastrous rock concert, a leper, marijuana, a radio host whose wife died while he was on the air, and he competes against technology to find a serial killer.At the end of Monk's hour comes the time for Shawn Spencer (James Roday) and his long-suffering pal Gus (Dul&eacute; Hill). Shawn's strict, humorless dad coached him since early childhood to be the perfect future cop -- hyperobservant, highly intelligent, the perfect detective. But when he reports his observations to the police, they arrest him -- and his only way out is to pretend to be psychic.In fact, his gimmick works brilliantly -- soon he sets up shop as a psychic, after plucking Gus from a dull job. Among their colourful cases: death at a spelling bee, a haunting at a sorority house, a wedding tainted by theft and murder, a ghostly stalking, a cat used as a witness, Civil war reenactments, a comic book convention, alien abductions, underground poker, and organizing a surprise birthday party for Lassiter.""Monk"" and ""Psych"" have a lot in common. They're both about hyperobservant eccentrics, and they both have solid mysteries and some hilarious writing, although Monk tends to be rather sadder in tone, compared to the frothy twentysomething hijinks of Gus and Shawn. Seen together, these shows seem like two of a kind.But whatever the differences, they both have colourful mysteries (sometimes with unexpected twists), and some deliciously strange dialogue, whether it's Monk being depressed (""I wish I drank. Is it wonderful?"") or Shawn flailing to be pretending to be psychic (""Spare me! Spare me! AUUUWWWWW!""). And in between the comedy, we get to see what shaped the characters into who they are.Granted, neither series is quite perfect -- Monk's OCD becomes rather cartoonish in a few episodes, such as his nutty reaction to his shrink retiring. And the mysteries Shawn and Gus solve take a little while to be suitably mysterious -- by the middle of the season, they are both fun AND suspenseful, such as that whole speed-dating episode.The leads of both shows are absolutely delightful -- Tony Shalhoub can be hysterical (such as when he tries to be a butler), but can also be heartbreaking, such as when Monk watches his old wedding video. Roday, on the other hand, is just a hilarious comic actor. His Shawn is devoid of responsibility or dignity, and he rides through on luck --but he has a good heart, and is genuinely good at being a detective.And both shows have great supporting casts, especially Hill as the long-suffering Gus, and Traylor Howard as Monk's nurse-sidekick. All the cops -- including Gray-Stanford and Ormondson -- get plenty of character development. And they have some celebrity appearances: ""Psych"" has George Takei, while Monk has some small, hilarious roles for Alice Cooper and Tucci. And Sean Astin gives a glorious performance as a murderous, spoiled rich brat.The fifth season of ""Monk"" helped the first season of ""Psych"" get off the ground. These smartly-written, humorous mystery series are well-paired, and both are definitely worth getting.",4,The psych of Monk,1175904000,"04 7, 2007",2007,3949,"['Last', 'year', 'longrunning', 'detective', 'series', 'Monk', 'obsessie-compulsive', 'detective', 'got', 'paired', 'new', 'show', 'lighthearted', 'comedy-mystery', 'series', 'kooky', 'faux-psychic', 'who', 'crimes', 'Together', 'shows', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'delightful', 'charmingly', 'eccentric', 'characters', 'very', 'nice', 'writing.The', 'fifth', 'season', 'Monk', 'movie', 'be', 'made', 'Monk', 'Tony', 'Shalhoub', 'life', 'amazing', 'abilities', 'well-known', 'actor', 'David', 'Ruskin', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'Monk', 'Ruskin', 'out', 'be', 'world', 'best', 'method', 'actor', 'Monk', 'doing', 'detective', 'work', 'acquire', 'Monk', 'OCD', 'personality.But', 'Monk', 'problems', 'do', ""n't"", 'cease', 'when', 'paralyzed', 'garbage', 'strike', 'strike', 'leader', 'murdered', 'Other', 'cases', 'include', 'mysterious', 'electrocution', 'gym', 'shower', 'being', 'blinded', 'murderer', 'stint', 'private', 'eye', 'college', 'reunion', 'disastrous', 'rock', 'concert', 'leper', 'marijuana', 'radio', 'host', 'wife', 'died', 'was', 'air', 'technology', 'find', 'serial', 'killer.At', 'end', 'Monk', 'hour', 'time', 'Shawn', 'Spencer', 'James', 'Roday', 'long-suffering', 'pal', 'Gus', 'Dul', 'eacute', 'Hill', 'Shawn', 'strict', 'humorless', 'dad', 'coached', 'early', 'childhood', 'be', 'perfect', 'future', 'cop', 'hyperobservant', 'highly', 'intelligent', 'perfect', 'detective', 'when', 'observations', 'police', 'arrest', 'only', 'way', 'out', 'pretend', 'be', 'psychic.In', 'fact', 'gimmick', 'brilliantly', 'soon', 'up', 'shop', 'psychic', 'plucking', 'Gus', 'dull', 'job', 'colourful', 'cases', 'death', 'spelling', 'bee', 'haunting', 'sorority', 'house', 'wedding', 'tainted', 'theft', 'murder', 'ghostly', 'stalking', 'cat', 'used', 'witness', 'Civil', 'war', 'reenactments', 'comic', 'book', 'convention', 'alien', 'abductions', 'underground', 'poker', 'organizing', 'surprise', 'birthday', 'party', 'Lassiter', 'Monk', 'Psych', 'have', 'lot', 'common', ""'re"", 'hyperobservant', 'eccentrics', 'have', 'solid', 'mysteries', 'hilarious', 'writing', 'Monk', 'be', 'rather', 'sadder', 'tone', 'compared', 'frothy', 'twentysomething', 'hijinks', 'Gus', 'Shawn', 'Seen', 'together', 'shows', 'seem', 'two', 'kind.But', 'differences', 'have', 'colourful', 'mysteries', 'sometimes', 'unexpected', 'twists', 'deliciously', 'strange', 'dialogue', 'Monk', 'being', 'depressed', 'wish', 'drank', 'wonderful', 'Shawn', 'flailing', 'be', 'pretending', 'be', 'psychic', 'Spare', 'Spare', 'AUUUWWWWW', 'comedy', 'get', 'see', 'what', 'shaped', 'characters', 'who', 'are.Granted', 'series', 'quite', 'perfect', 'Monk', 'OCD', 'rather', 'cartoonish', 'few', 'episodes', 'such', 'nutty', 'reaction', 'shrink', 'retiring', 'mysteries', 'Shawn', 'Gus', 'solve', 'take', 'little', 'while', 'be', 'suitably', 'mysterious', 'middle', 'season', 'are', 'fun', 'suspenseful', 'such', 'whole', 'speed-dating', 'episode.The', 'leads', 'shows', 'are', 'absolutely', 'delightful', 'Tony', 'Shalhoub', 'can', 'be', 'hysterical', 'such', 'when', 'be', 'butler', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'heartbreaking', 'such', 'when', 'Monk', 'old', 'wedding', 'video', 'Roday', 'other', 'hand', 'just', 'hilarious', 'comic', 'actor', 'Shawn', 'devoid', 'responsibility', 'dignity', 'luck', 'good', 'heart', 'genuinely', 'good', 'being', 'detective.And', 'shows', 'have', 'great', 'supporting', 'casts', 'especially', 'Hill', 'long-suffering', 'Gus', 'Traylor', 'Howard', 'Monk', 'nurse-sidekick', 'cops', 'including', 'Gray-Stanford', 'Ormondson', 'get', 'plenty', 'character', 'development', 'have', 'celebrity', 'appearances', 'Psych', 'George', 'Takei', 'Monk', 'small', 'hilarious', 'roles', 'Alice', 'Cooper', 'Tucci', 'Sean', 'Astin', 'glorious', 'performance', 'murderous', 'spoiled', 'rich', 'brat.The', 'fifth', 'season', 'Monk', 'helped', 'first', 'season', 'Psych', 'get', 'ground', 'smartly-written', 'humorous', 'mystery', 'series', 'are', 'well-paired', 'are', 'definitely', 'worth', 'getting']",N/A

I'm talking about fellow TV show Psych.  The two fit together perfectly and make for two fun hours of TV every Friday.Up first is established hit Monk.  In its fifth season, the show follows the adventures of Adrian Monk (Tony Shalhoub).  Monk is a former homicide detective who had to leave his job when his phobias and obsessive compulsive disorder overwhelmed him.  But he still works with the police to solve murders, which is why he finds himself solving the murder of a union boss or racing against the clock to find the ""Six Way Killer.""  Along the way, he has to face and overcome his fears while using his compulsions to find clues.Following that is newcomer Psych.  Like many freshman shows, this one took a while to find its footing.  It follows the adventures of Shawn Spencer (James Roday).  From birth, Shawn has been trained by his dad to be the perfect cop with amazing observational skills.  When he tries to use those to tip off the police, he comes under suspicion himself, so he pretends to be a psychic to get out of that jam.  He has so much fun, he decides to do it full time, worming his way into kidnappings, robberies, and murders.At their heart, these two shows are very similar.  Both are mixes of comedy and mystery.  Both feature unusual cases that cater to the unique gifts of their main characters.  Monk has a more somber tone underneath the fun, while Psych is pure, light hearted fun.  As I said, Psych was still finding its footing this year, but the majority of the episodes really are fun to watch.This combo set is the two individual sets shrink wrapped together.  No special extras.  However, it is cheaper then buying the two sets individually.I love mysteries, and I love to laugh, so these shows are perfect for me.
