If you are not in that group, then skip this film. This transfer is especially good in both the audio and visual departments considering the fact that it is almost eighty years old. The plot is very simple. Rudy Bronson (Valee) and his band go to Long Island and attempt to audition for Ted Grant, who has loaned his name to a musical correspondence course that Bronson took and according to a newspaper clipping is looking for new talent. Promptly thrown out by the butler, the band members decide to break into Grant's home through the garden entrance, set up their instruments, and play for Grant anyway. However, Grant has already left to go back to New York. A series of misunderstandings has Bronson mistaken for the famous Grant by a neighbor, Mrs. Ethel Bertha Whitehall (Marie Dressler). A series of musical performances and comic misunderstandings later, and Mrs. Whitehall's neice has fallen for Bronson, Bronson and his band wind up playing for a benefit, and ultimately the band is discovered as a great talent after all. End of happy story.There is an introduction to the film by Michael Young, director of Education at the New York Film Academy, that does a pretty good job of briefly explaining the challenges of early talking pictures such as these. Since the microphone is usually in a fixed position in these first sound films, the actors and actresses have to move to ""their mark"" in order to speak and be heard clearly. This explains the static appearance of most scenes whenever speech is involved. It also explains why every little sound such as footsteps and clanging bracelets can often be heard as clearly as the players.The musical performances are quite good and include several big hits of that time including the title song which Valee also performs in ""Glorifying the American Girl"" which also came out in 1929. There is also a dancing performance by a group of chorus girls that involves some interesting formations that are photographed from a top view several years before Busby Berkeley made this sort of thing an art form. Rudy Valee and the other players leave much to be desired in the acting department, leaving plenty of room for Marie Dressler to steal the show as the comic society matron.The DVD actually includes some extras including an old interview with Rudy Vallee's widow, a bonus serial short that is pretty good entitled ""Zorro's Fighting Legion"" from the late 1930's, some program notes on Rudy Valee, and finally a very strange little dancing performance by some children entitled ""Radiation March"" which appears to be some kind of environmental service message that doesn't appear to be more than ten years old.",4,An interesting little curio of the early talkie era,1178236800,"05 4, 2007",2007,2780,"['four', 'star', 'rating', 'applies', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'early', 'talkies', 'early', 'talkie', 'musicals', 'particular', 'are', 'not', 'group', 'then', 'skip', 'film', 'transfer', 'especially', 'good', 'audio', 'visual', 'departments', 'considering', 'fact', 'almost', 'eighty', 'years', 'old', 'plot', 'very', 'simple', 'Rudy', 'Bronson', 'Valee', 'band', 'go', 'Long', 'Island', 'attempt', 'audition', 'Ted', 'Grant', 'who', 'loaned', 'name', 'musical', 'correspondence', 'course', 'Bronson', 'took', 'according', 'newspaper', 'clipping', 'looking', 'new', 'talent', 'Promptly', 'thrown', 'out', 'butler', 'band', 'members', 'decide', 'break', 'Grant', 'home', 'garden', 'entrance', 'set', 'up', 'instruments', 'play', 'Grant', 'anyway', 'However', 'Grant', 'already', 'left', 'go', 'back', 'New', 'York', 'A', 'series', 'misunderstandings', 'Bronson', 'mistaken', 'famous', 'Grant', 'neighbor', 'Mrs.', 'Ethel', 'Bertha', 'Whitehall', 'Marie', 'Dressler', 'series', 'musical', 'performances', 'comic', 'misunderstandings', 'later', 'Mrs.', 'Whitehall', 'neice', 'fallen', 'Bronson', 'Bronson', 'band', 'up', 'playing', 'benefit', 'ultimately', 'band', 'discovered', 'great', 'talent', 'End', 'happy', 'introduction', 'film', 'Michael', 'Young', 'director', 'Education', 'New', 'York', 'Film', 'Academy', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'briefly', 'explaining', 'challenges', 'early', 'talking', 'pictures', 'such', 'microphone', 'usually', 'fixed', 'position', 'first', 'sound', 'films', 'actors', 'actresses', 'have', 'move', 'mark', 'order', 'speak', 'be', 'heard', 'clearly', 'static', 'appearance', 'most', 'scenes', 'whenever', 'speech', 'involved', 'also', 'why', 'little', 'sound', 'such', 'footsteps', 'clanging', 'bracelets', 'can', 'often', 'be', 'heard', 'as', 'clearly', 'players.The', 'musical', 'performances', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'include', 'several', 'big', 'hits', 'time', 'including', 'title', 'song', 'Valee', 'also', 'Glorifying', 'American', 'Girl', 'also', 'came', 'out', '1929', 'also', 'dancing', 'performance', 'group', 'chorus', 'girls', 'interesting', 'formations', 'are', 'photographed', 'top', 'view', 'several', 'years', 'Busby', 'Berkeley', 'made', 'sort', 'thing', 'art', 'form', 'Rudy', 'Valee', 'other', 'players', 'leave', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'acting', 'department', 'leaving', 'plenty', 'room', 'Marie', 'Dressler', 'steal', 'show', 'comic', 'society', 'matron.The', 'DVD', 'actually', 'extras', 'including', 'old', 'interview', 'Rudy', 'Vallee', 'widow', 'bonus', 'serial', 'short', 'pretty', 'good', 'entitled', 'Zorro', 'Fighting', 'Legion', 'late', '1930', 'program', 'notes', 'Rudy', 'Valee', 'finally', 'very', 'strange', 'little', 'dancing', 'performance', 'children', 'entitled', 'Radiation', 'March', 'be', 'kind', 'environmental', 'service', 'message', ""n't"", 'appear', 'be', 'more', 'ten', 'years', 'old']",N/A

886158,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B0007PALK2,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[1, 1]","The Vagabond Lover is a relatively strong early talkie despite a few flaws. Sure, Rudy Vall&eacute;e's acting is stiff--and whose idea was it for him to sing with his heavily made-up eyes closed, anyway? He was wearing too much eye makeup, unfortunately. Marie Dressler's acting, on the other hand, is excellent and that's grand considering that this film was her first talking motion picture. The plot moves along a bit too slowly but the musical numbers are quite good and overall it's still an enjoyable movie.When the action starts, Rudy Bronson (Rudy Vall&eacute;e) and his band mates (The Connecticut Yankees) are practicing; they want to make their mark in show business. Their playing isn't exactly the best; but Rudy has confidence in their future especially since he is a graduate of the Ted Grant mail order saxophone playing school. To increase their chances of being discovered, Rudy and the band decide to visit Ted Grant (Malcolm Waite) on his Long Island estate; but when they get there Ted leaves for the city without seeing the young band that traveled to visit him.However, the band members are not going away all that quickly. They sneak into Ted Grant's house but get noticed by Mrs. Ethel Bertha Whitehall (Marie Dressler) and her niece Jean (Sally Blane) who live next door. Officer Tuttle (Charles Sellon) arrives but Rudy and his buddies manage to convince him that they really are Ted Grant and his band. The cop still has his doubts but he leaves them alone--for now. It also isn't long before Jean and Rudy see romance when they look into each other's eyes; and it helps the plot to have this romance blossom.It's essentially a case of mistaken identity and people like Rudy and his mates keep up the false pretenses until more and more trouble comes their way. Look for some fairly interesting ""misunderstandings"" that develop throughout the film.The musical numbers are great. Rudy didn't act very well; but he sings songs like """"I Love You, Believe Me, I Love You"" flawlessly. What a voice he had! Rudy does an equally good job when he sings """"If You Were the Only Girl in the World, and I Were the Only Boy."" There is a small kiddie act by four young girls who play orphans at a charity benefit; they sing ""Georgie Porgie"" very sweetly.The Vagabond Lover is a classic movie that should be remembered more fondly. Marie Dressler practically steals every scene she's in; and the musical numbers by Rudy Vall&eacute;e and The Connecticut Yankees are entertaining. I happily recommend this film.",4,"for good, clean fun there's nothing like a vagabond lover",1231027200,"01 4, 2009",2009,2523,"['Vagabond', 'Lover', 'relatively', 'strong', 'early', 'talkie', 'few', 'flaws', 'Sure', 'Rudy', 'Vall', 'eacute', 'acting', 'stiff', 'idea', 'was', 'sing', 'heavily', 'made-up', 'eyes', 'closed', 'anyway', 'was', 'wearing', 'too', 'much', 'eye', 'makeup', 'unfortunately', 'Marie', 'Dressler', 'acting', 'other', 'hand', 'excellent', 'grand', 'considering', 'film', 'was', 'first', 'talking', 'motion', 'picture', 'plot', 'along', 'bit', 'too', 'slowly', 'musical', 'numbers', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'overall', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'movie.When', 'action', 'Rudy', 'Bronson', 'Rudy', 'Vall', 'eacute', 'band', 'mates', 'Connecticut', 'Yankees', 'are', 'practicing', 'want', 'make', 'mark', 'show', 'business', 'playing', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'best', 'Rudy', 'confidence', 'future', 'especially', 'graduate', 'Ted', 'Grant', 'mail', 'order', 'saxophone', 'playing', 'school', 'increase', 'chances', 'being', 'discovered', 'Rudy', 'band', 'decide', 'visit', 'Ted', 'Grant', 'Malcolm', 'Waite', 'Long', 'Island', 'estate', 'when', 'get', 'there', 'Ted', 'city', 'seeing', 'young', 'band', 'traveled', 'visit', 'him.However', 'band', 'members', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'away', 'quickly', 'sneak', 'Ted', 'Grant', 'house', 'get', 'noticed', 'Mrs.', 'Ethel', 'Bertha', 'Whitehall', 'Marie', 'Dressler', 'niece', 'Jean', 'Sally', 'Blane', 'who', 'live', 'next', 'door', 'Officer', 'Tuttle', 'Charles', 'Sellon', 'Rudy', 'buddies', 'manage', 'convince', 'really', 'are', 'Ted', 'Grant', 'band', 'cop', 'still', 'doubts', 'alone', 'now', 'also', ""n't"", 'long', 'before', 'Jean', 'Rudy', 'see', 'romance', 'when', 'look', 'other', 'eyes', 'plot', 'have', 'romance', 'blossom.It', 'essentially', 'case', 'mistaken', 'identity', 'people', 'Rudy', 'mates', 'keep', 'false', 'pretenses', 'more', 'more', 'trouble', 'way', 'Look', 'fairly', 'interesting', 'misunderstandings', 'develop', 'film.The', 'musical', 'numbers', 'are', 'great', 'Rudy', 'did', ""n't"", 'act', 'very', 'well', 'songs', 'Love', 'Believe', 'Me', 'Love', 'flawlessly', 'What', 'voice', 'had', 'Rudy', 'equally', 'good', 'job', 'when', 'Were', 'Only', 'Girl', 'World', 'Were', 'Only', 'Boy', 'small', 'kiddie', 'act', 'four', 'young', 'girls', 'who', 'play', 'orphans', 'charity', 'benefit', 'sing', 'Georgie', 'Porgie', 'very', 'sweetly.The', 'Vagabond', 'Lover', 'classic', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'remembered', 'more', 'fondly', 'Marie', 'Dressler', 'practically', 'scene', 'musical', 'numbers', 'Rudy', 'Vall', 'eacute', 'Connecticut', 'Yankees', 'are', 'entertaining', 'happily', 'recommend', 'film']",N/A

When the film was finished, and cut the original camera negative was destroyed in a fire before it was released. RKO used outtakes to assemble the finished film. Some of these were inferior takes, but it'a all they had. The Roan version uses a clean 16mm original print that's complete at 65 minutes. It even has the RKO logo.
