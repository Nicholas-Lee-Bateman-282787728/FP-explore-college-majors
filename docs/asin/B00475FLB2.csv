1388090,A3B698AJ4V9NS,B00475FLB2,Susan Nunes,"[7, 10]","I enjoy this series.  I agree with another reviewer that Deadly Women uses too many re-enactments and not enough documentary footage, although I enjoy the series' irreverent approach to true crime.  By contrast, this show has documentary footage, interviews with many of the principals and investigators in the case profiled in each episode, including occasionally the convicted killer.  I think the early seasons might be better than the more recent ones because they were only a half-hour long in the earlier years.  I don't think these episodes need to be dragged out for an hour.My main complaint is the producers have no hesitation of putting the crime scene photographs of victims, sometimes showing them repeatedly and close up.  What is the point of this, other than sensationalism?  There are friends and family members of these murder victims who actually might be watching the show, and I feel the producers are a bit too insensitive to their feelings.  One of the most disturbing episodes in this set was the one about ""Elisa McNabney,"" aka Laren Renee Sims Jordan.  I happened to have known her victim, husband Larry McNabney, although not well.  He was an attorney who had an office in Las Vegas when he met Elisa/Laren, but he was based in Reno.  McNabney was a regular patron at the law library located upstairs in the courthouse in Reno where I had worked part-time back in the 1990s-early 2000s.  He would frequently come in on the weekends. He would exchange banter with me and always get a cup of coffee. Very pleasant guy, always wore a cowboy hat.  At least once, Elisa/Laren came in with him.  It may have been after they were married.  They had checked out some books.  I was so horrified when I had heard McNabney was murdered in Sacramento some years later and especially in the heinous way it was done.  That was unnerving enough, but then we have this show that has no compunction of showing the man's body after he was dug up from a shallow grave Elisa/Laren and her co-conspirator Sarah Dutra had buried him.  This was a real person, not a mere body, a real person who had a family and many friends who loved him.  I could have gone the rest of my life and never have seen that picture.  One could say the same thing about the other episodes where these pictures are shown for pure shock value.  Despicable.This is the reason I docked one star off of this review.  I don't think showing the crime scene photos is necessary; other true crime shows don't do it and don't need to do it.  Snapped's producers shouldn't do it, either.",4,Good true crime series,1328832000,"02 10, 2012",2012,2559,"['enjoy', 'series', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'Deadly', 'Women', 'too', 'many', 're-enactments', 'not', 'enough', 'documentary', 'footage', 'enjoy', 'series', 'irreverent', 'approach', 'true', 'crime', 'contrast', 'show', 'documentary', 'footage', 'interviews', 'many', 'principals', 'investigators', 'case', 'profiled', 'episode', 'including', 'occasionally', 'convicted', 'killer', 'think', 'early', 'seasons', 'might', 'be', 'better', 'more', 'recent', 'ones', 'were', 'only', 'half-hour', 'long', 'earlier', 'years', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'episodes', 'need', 'be', 'dragged', 'out', 'hour.My', 'main', 'complaint', 'producers', 'have', 'hesitation', 'putting', 'crime', 'scene', 'photographs', 'victims', 'sometimes', 'showing', 'repeatedly', 'close', 'up', 'What', 'point', 'other', 'sensationalism', 'are', 'friends', 'family', 'members', 'murder', 'victims', 'who', 'actually', 'might', 'be', 'watching', 'show', 'feel', 'producers', 'are', 'bit', 'too', 'insensitive', 'feelings', 'One', 'most', 'disturbing', 'episodes', 'set', 'was', 'one', 'Elisa', 'McNabney', 'Laren', 'Renee', 'Sims', 'Jordan', 'happened', 'have', 'known', 'victim', 'husband', 'Larry', 'McNabney', 'not', 'well', 'was', 'attorney', 'who', 'had', 'office', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'when', 'met', 'Elisa/Laren', 'was', 'based', 'Reno', 'McNabney', 'was', 'regular', 'patron', 'law', 'library', 'located', 'upstairs', 'courthouse', 'Reno', 'where', 'had', 'worked', 'part-time', 'back', '1990s-early', '2000s', 'would', 'frequently', 'come', 'weekends', 'would', 'exchange', 'banter', 'always', 'get', 'cup', 'coffee', 'Very', 'pleasant', 'guy', 'always', 'wore', 'cowboy', 'hat', 'least', 'once', 'Elisa/Laren', 'came', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'were', 'married', 'had', 'checked', 'out', 'books', 'was', 'so', 'horrified', 'when', 'had', 'heard', 'McNabney', 'was', 'murdered', 'Sacramento', 'years', 'later', 'especially', 'heinous', 'way', 'was', 'done', 'was', 'unnerving', 'enough', 'then', 'have', 'show', 'compunction', 'showing', 'man', 'body', 'was', 'dug', 'up', 'shallow', 'grave', 'Elisa/Laren', 'co-conspirator', 'Sarah', 'Dutra', 'had', 'buried', 'was', 'real', 'person', 'not', 'mere', 'body', 'real', 'person', 'who', 'had', 'family', 'many', 'friends', 'who', 'loved', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'rest', 'life', 'never', 'have', 'seen', 'picture', 'One', 'could', 'say', 'same', 'thing', 'other', 'episodes', 'where', 'pictures', 'are', 'shown', 'pure', 'shock', 'value', 'Despicable.This', 'reason', 'docked', 'one', 'star', 'review', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'showing', 'crime', 'scene', 'photos', 'necessary', 'other', 'true', 'crime', 'shows', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'do', 'Snapped', 'producers', 'should', ""n't"", 'do', 'either']",Snapped - Complete Seasons 1 & 2 - The Killer Collection - As Seen on Oxygen! 26 Episodes
