1639705,AQLDURX81AGIA,B00BVMX9O0,"H. L. Cripe ""cooncat3""","[1, 1]","This DVD set is a mixed bag. I agree with most reviewers that the three episodes dealing with Compo's death and funeral are three of the best episodes ever written and acted in the entire run of the show. My beef is that so much has been cut out of the episodes in putting them on the DVD. So much was cut out of ""Elegy for Fallen Wellies"" that the DVD version often seems jerky and unconnected. Originally, this episode began with a charming and hilarious several minutes of the women rehearsing their musical act in their pink costumes. This has been cut completely out of the DVD version -- sadly, because it so perfectly sets up the idea of Compo having a heart attack when he sees Nora in the costume -- and if we haven't seen the costume in the song-and-dance act, the effect suffers. Another instance is that the scene of the passing out of the white painters' overalls by Truly has been cut. The DVD scene shows only one person being handed the overalls, while the original of the episode shows a number of men showing up to receive the overalls, thus making the meaning of the scene at the end more logical. These omissions make me wonder how much has been cut from the other episodes, and even from previous DVDS. The exit of a beloved character and the introduction of his replacement is often awkward; it is more so in this series because there simply is no replacement for Compo, and thus the stories of the new characters just do not seem to fit and are hardly worth watching.This brings me to something else I've noticed. Two entire series of the program are missing on the DVDs issued in the US, and the dates given on the albums do not coincide with the years the series appeared originally in England. Series 12 (1990, English dates) and Series 16 (1995, English dates), a total of 18 episodes and two specials, have never been issued on DVD in the US. Series 12 welcomes back Foggy to the trio and sees the departure of Seymour (""Return of the Warrior"") and its last episode, ""A Landlady for Smiler"", leads directly into the next series. The US edition picks up with the next season, with Smiler already boarding with Nora Batty, but we have no knowledge of how he got there since that previous season is missing. Series 16 is another Foggy series and contains some very funny episodes. My question is, where are these two seasons and are we ever going to see them issued in US DVDs?I wonder if anyone else has noticed these omissions? And I hope whoever is issuing the US DVDs will give us a ""catch-up"" album containing these episodes -- I am surprised that, as much as US viewers love the show, nobody else has noticed these omissions and asked that they be issued.",3,Where are the missing parts?,1390262400,"01 21, 2014",2014,2686,"['DVD', 'set', 'mixed', 'bag', 'agree', 'most', 'reviewers', 'three', 'episodes', 'dealing', 'Compo', 'death', 'funeral', 'are', 'three', 'best', 'episodes', 'ever', 'written', 'acted', 'entire', 'run', 'show', 'beef', 'so', 'much', 'been', 'cut', 'episodes', 'putting', 'DVD', 'So', 'much', 'was', 'cut', 'Elegy', 'Fallen', 'Wellies', 'DVD', 'version', 'often', 'jerky', 'unconnected', 'Originally', 'episode', 'began', 'charming', 'hilarious', 'several', 'minutes', 'women', 'rehearsing', 'musical', 'act', 'pink', 'costumes', 'been', 'cut', 'completely', 'DVD', 'version', 'sadly', 'so', 'perfectly', 'up', 'idea', 'Compo', 'having', 'heart', 'attack', 'when', 'Nora', 'costume', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'costume', 'song-and-dance', 'act', 'effect', 'suffers', 'instance', 'scene', 'passing', 'white', 'painters', 'overalls', 'Truly', 'been', 'cut', 'DVD', 'scene', 'only', 'one', 'person', 'being', 'handed', 'overalls', 'original', 'episode', 'number', 'men', 'showing', 'up', 'receive', 'overalls', 'thus', 'making', 'meaning', 'scene', 'end', 'more', 'logical', 'omissions', 'make', 'wonder', 'how', 'much', 'been', 'cut', 'other', 'episodes', 'even', 'previous', 'DVDS', 'exit', 'beloved', 'character', 'introduction', 'replacement', 'often', 'awkward', 'more', 'so', 'series', 'simply', 'replacement', 'Compo', 'thus', 'stories', 'new', 'characters', 'just', 'do', 'not', 'seem', 'fit', 'are', 'hardly', 'worth', 'watching.This', 'something', 'else', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'Two', 'entire', 'series', 'program', 'are', 'missing', 'DVDs', 'issued', 'US', 'dates', 'given', 'albums', 'do', 'not', 'coincide', 'years', 'series', 'appeared', 'originally', 'England', 'Series', '12', '1990', 'English', '16', '1995', 'English', 'total', '18', 'episodes', 'two', 'specials', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'issued', 'DVD', 'US', 'Series', '12', 'welcomes', 'back', 'Foggy', 'trio', 'departure', 'Seymour', 'Return', 'Warrior', 'last', 'episode', 'Landlady', 'Smiler', 'directly', 'next', 'series', 'US', 'edition', 'up', 'next', 'season', 'Smiler', 'already', 'boarding', 'Nora', 'Batty', 'have', 'knowledge', 'how', 'got', 'there', 'previous', 'season', 'missing', 'Series', '16', 'Foggy', 'series', 'very', 'funny', 'episodes', 'question', 'where', 'are', 'two', 'seasons', 'are', 'ever', 'going', 'see', 'issued', 'US', 'DVDs', 'wonder', 'anyone', 'else', 'noticed', 'omissions', 'hope', 'whoever', 'issuing', 'US', 'DVDs', 'will', 'give', 'catch-up', 'album', 'containing', 'episodes', 'am', 'surprised', 'that', 'as', 'much', 'US', 'viewers', 'love', 'show', 'nobody', 'else', 'noticed', 'omissions', 'asked', 'be', 'issued']",Last of the Summer Wine: Vintage 2000

Mcgrail,"[0, 0]","Every now and then, an actor comes along who simply, with his mere presense, takes over the film or TV show.Bill Owen was such an actor.With an excellent career already behind him in Britain's &#34;Carry On&#34; comedies back in the 1950s, he burst back on the scene in what would become the longest running sitcom in world history.Owen always appeared to me to be an actor born out of his time. Like Rowan Atkinson, he would have extremely comfortable in the silent comedies of the 1920s. Bill Owen became the defacto star of Last of the Summer Wine. His playful physical comedy lifted the show in every respect.For those unfamiliar with the show, I would suggest you start with the episodes from the 1980s on. In these episodes you will meet the, at times very strange, townspeople of Holmfirth in Yorkshire. In fact, you will become so familiar with the town, you will feel you live there yourself. And you might even want to visit it.If you have never seen the series, do not expect it to be anything like American comedy. American comedy is driven by one-liners, British comedy is story-driven. Do not expect to get the feel of the show with only a few episodes. Stick with it, and you will be pleasently surprised with how easily you are drawn into the world of Roy Clarke's creation.The 2000 series features the last episodes with Bill Owen, and a three episode story arc dealing with his death, and fittingly for Compo, his serio-comic funeral. These episodes contain the only dramatic moments in the entire series. You will laugh and cry at the same time. A testament to the brilliant creator/writer, Roy Clarke.Last of the Summer Wine is truly one of Britian's greatest imports to the US. Gentle, pleasent, family friendly comedy that will endure for years.Drink one last toast to Bill Owen, may your wellies live forever.",5,A must buy for all fans of great comedy,1388448000,"12 31, 2013",2013,1832,"['now', 'then', 'actor', 'who', 'simply', 'mere', 'presense', 'film', 'TV', 'show.Bill', 'Owen', 'was', 'such', 'actor.With', 'excellent', 'career', 'already', 'Britain', '34', 'Carry', '34', 'comedies', 'back', '1950s', 'back', 'scene', 'what', 'would', 'become', 'longest', 'running', 'sitcom', 'world', 'history.Owen', 'always', 'appeared', 'be', 'actor', 'born', 'time', 'Rowan', 'Atkinson', 'would', 'have', 'extremely', 'comfortable', 'silent', 'comedies', '1920s', 'Bill', 'Owen', 'became', 'defacto', 'star', 'Last', 'Summer', 'Wine', 'playful', 'physical', 'comedy', 'lifted', 'show', 'respect.For', 'unfamiliar', 'show', 'would', 'suggest', 'start', 'episodes', '1980s', 'episodes', 'will', 'meet', 'times', 'very', 'strange', 'townspeople', 'Holmfirth', 'Yorkshire', 'fact', 'will', 'become', 'so', 'familiar', 'town', 'will', 'feel', 'live', 'might', 'even', 'want', 'visit', 'it.If', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'series', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'be', 'anything', 'American', 'comedy', 'American', 'comedy', 'driven', 'one-liners', 'British', 'comedy', 'story-driven', 'Do', 'not', 'expect', 'get', 'feel', 'show', 'only', 'few', 'episodes', 'Stick', 'will', 'be', 'pleasently', 'surprised', 'how', 'easily', 'are', 'drawn', 'world', 'Roy', 'Clarke', 'creation.The', '2000', 'series', 'last', 'episodes', 'Bill', 'Owen', 'three', 'episode', 'story', 'dealing', 'death', 'fittingly', 'Compo', 'serio-comic', 'funeral', 'episodes', 'contain', 'only', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'entire', 'series', 'will', 'laugh', 'cry', 'same', 'time', 'testament', 'brilliant', 'creator/writer', 'Roy', 'Clarke.Last', 'Summer', 'Wine', 'truly', 'one', 'Britian', 'greatest', 'imports', 'US', 'Gentle', 'pleasent', 'family', 'friendly', 'comedy', 'will', 'endure', 'years.Drink', 'one', 'last', 'toast', 'Bill', 'Owen', 'may', 'wellies', 'live', 'forever']",Last of the Summer Wine: Vintage 2000
