567119,A23BTLTIHMJN01,B000055WGK,A. Simon,"[0, 0]","The main plot is a rendition of Turgenev's First Love, but one of Chekov's short story is added, I suspect, as a filler. I personally dislike Kirsten Dunst, but I must say that she is very good at her role as a sociopathic, genteel, tease (she even looks Slavic). To be sure, the acting all around is excellent, and the costumes and props are impeccable.The plot begins with the arrival at a country house of an impoverished princess and her daughter; the mother is vulgar, her daughter is not. As the main title of Turgenev's story indicates it is about a young man's puppy love, and the cruel, crushing reality check that he ultimately receives. The movie, incidentally, does well in capturing the times during the 1800s (and late 1700s) when upper and middle class women were adept at having ""salons,"" where they would be the center of attention and men would grovel before a woman in order to receive a kind word or gesture or attention from her. Thank God those days are gone.There are a couple of additional scenes in the movie that were not in the book but are necessary in order to get closure in the movie and, in fact, add and not detract from the story.",5,Turgenev & Chekov for the price of one!,1312675200,"08 7, 2011",2011,1164,"['main', 'plot', 'rendition', 'Turgenev', 'First', 'Love', 'one', 'Chekov', 'short', 'story', 'added', 'suspect', 'filler', 'personally', 'dislike', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'must', 'say', 'very', 'good', 'role', 'sociopathic', 'genteel', 'tease', 'even', 'Slavic', 'be', 'sure', 'acting', 'around', 'excellent', 'costumes', 'props', 'are', 'impeccable.The', 'plot', 'arrival', 'country', 'house', 'impoverished', 'princess', 'daughter', 'mother', 'vulgar', 'daughter', 'not', 'main', 'title', 'Turgenev', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'puppy', 'love', 'cruel', 'crushing', 'reality', 'check', 'ultimately', 'movie', 'incidentally', 'well', 'capturing', 'times', '1800s', 'late', '1700s', 'when', 'upper', 'middle', 'class', 'women', 'were', 'adept', 'having', 'salons', 'where', 'would', 'be', 'center', 'attention', 'men', 'would', 'grovel', 'woman', 'order', 'receive', 'kind', 'word', 'gesture', 'attention', 'Thank', 'God', 'days', 'are', 'gone.There', 'are', 'couple', 'additional', 'scenes', 'movie', 'were', 'not', 'book', 'are', 'necessary', 'order', 'get', 'closure', 'movie', 'fact', 'add', 'not', 'detract', 'story']",N/A

567124,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000055WGK,Tsuyoshi,"[6, 10]","This film credits as its source two Russian stories -- Ivan Turgenev's ""First Love"" and Anton Chekhov's ""The Peasant Women"" -- but the basic plot is based on the first one, a classic novella about a young boy Vladimir, who suffers growing pains during the short summer vacation in Russian countryside.  The second story by Chekhov is used as a sub-plot about a man and woman and their illicit love.Nick Stahl is Vladimir Petrovich, taking summer vacation with his parents in sunny Russian countryhouse, and to their neighborhood comes a girl Zinaida ""Princess"" Zasyekin and her mother.  Vladimir instantly falls in love with this capricious girl, much elder than him, and starts to haunt the house where  her mother, apparently down-at-heel, lives.  The girl's innocent, comical flirt with other suitors, including Count and Doctor. continues until the day when Zinaida, Vladimir finds out, really falls in love with someone he doesn't know.  But who is he?  And what should he do?The book's story about tormented love, which poisons the young heart, is barely visible in the film, but the result is simply deplorable, because of its too superficial treatment of the subject.  The identity of the lover looks too abruptly revealed, that is one problem, but more annoying is that we are not convinced of the relations between these people.  The book tells us about the tacit understanding and compassion between Vladimir and his father, but as the film fails to deliver that part, some of the viewers would not understand the painful experience of Vladimir at the end of the story.As to actors, Nick Stahl cannot hold the center of our attention, lacking the emotional power those young boys of 16 yeads old should have, and Kirsten Dunst, despite her best efforts, is miscast as a Russian beauty who changes the life of males surrounding her.  And when Julie Walters (""Billy Elliot"" ""Educating Rita"" and Harry Potter series as Ron's mother) looks very irritating as old Princess, being too vulgar and noisy for the part, you can tell there is something wrong with the picture.I think that the mishmash cast should be blamed -- some American, some British, all cast as Russian -- but more unaccountable decision is inclusion of Chekhov story.  Well, the point may be that the sub-plot should introduce a broader scope of viewpoint into this rather simple story of Turgenev.  One about aristocratic people, one working class people, both about doomed love.  The idea is all right, but as other reviewers rightly say, the second story looks too ineffective and too short (it consists of only about 20 minutes), lacking the sense of closure.  The original Chekhov story offers more to tell, but what is more important is that it looks too banal, stripped of the original's atomospheric descriptions.I tried to like this, and there are some merits, I can say.  The photography is beautiful, and costumes and production designs are done decently.  But the film shows no finesse for conveying the subtle touch of the book about the lost dreams and youth, and the film's changed ending is too awful.  Zinaida would not say that.",2,Too Superficial Adaptaion of Turgenev's Classic Novella,1050537600,"04 17, 2003",2003,3120,"['film', 'source', 'two', 'Russian', 'stories', 'Ivan', 'Turgenev', 'First', 'Love', 'Anton', 'Chekhov', 'Peasant', 'Women', 'basic', 'plot', 'based', 'first', 'one', 'classic', 'novella', 'young', 'boy', 'Vladimir', 'who', 'growing', 'pains', 'short', 'summer', 'vacation', 'Russian', 'countryside', 'second', 'story', 'Chekhov', 'used', 'sub-plot', 'man', 'woman', 'illicit', 'love.Nick', 'Stahl', 'Vladimir', 'Petrovich', 'taking', 'summer', 'vacation', 'parents', 'sunny', 'Russian', 'countryhouse', 'neighborhood', 'girl', 'Zinaida', 'Princess', 'Zasyekin', 'mother', 'Vladimir', 'instantly', 'love', 'capricious', 'girl', 'much', 'elder', 'haunt', 'house', 'where', 'mother', 'apparently', 'down-at-heel', 'girl', 'innocent', 'comical', 'flirt', 'other', 'suitors', 'including', 'Count', 'Doctor', 'day', 'when', 'Zinaida', 'Vladimir', 'out', 'really', 'love', 'someone', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'what', 'should', 'do', 'book', 'story', 'tormented', 'love', 'young', 'heart', 'barely', 'visible', 'film', 'result', 'simply', 'deplorable', 'too', 'superficial', 'treatment', 'subject', 'identity', 'lover', 'too', 'abruptly', 'revealed', 'one', 'problem', 'more', 'annoying', 'are', 'not', 'convinced', 'relations', 'people', 'book', 'tacit', 'understanding', 'compassion', 'Vladimir', 'father', 'film', 'deliver', 'part', 'viewers', 'would', 'not', 'understand', 'painful', 'experience', 'Vladimir', 'end', 'story.As', 'actors', 'Nick', 'Stahl', 'can', 'not', 'hold', 'center', 'attention', 'lacking', 'emotional', 'power', 'young', 'boys', '16', 'yeads', 'old', 'should', 'have', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'best', 'efforts', 'miscast', 'Russian', 'beauty', 'who', 'life', 'males', 'surrounding', 'when', 'Julie', 'Walters', 'Billy', 'Elliot', 'Educating', 'Rita', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'series', 'Ron', 'mother', 'very', 'irritating', 'old', 'Princess', 'being', 'too', 'vulgar', 'noisy', 'part', 'can', 'tell', 'something', 'wrong', 'picture.I', 'think', 'mishmash', 'cast', 'should', 'be', 'blamed', 'American', 'British', 'cast', 'Russian', 'more', 'unaccountable', 'decision', 'inclusion', 'Chekhov', 'story', 'Well', 'point', 'may', 'be', 'sub-plot', 'should', 'introduce', 'broader', 'scope', 'viewpoint', 'rather', 'simple', 'story', 'Turgenev', 'One', 'aristocratic', 'people', 'one', 'working', 'class', 'people', 'doomed', 'love', 'idea', 'right', 'other', 'reviewers', 'rightly', 'say', 'second', 'story', 'too', 'ineffective', 'too', 'short', 'only', '20', 'minutes', 'lacking', 'sense', 'closure', 'original', 'Chekhov', 'story', 'offers', 'more', 'tell', 'what', 'more', 'important', 'too', 'banal', 'stripped', 'original', 'atomospheric', 'descriptions.I', 'tried', 'like', 'are', 'merits', 'can', 'say', 'photography', 'beautiful', 'costumes', 'production', 'designs', 'are', 'done', 'decently', 'film', 'finesse', 'conveying', 'subtle', 'touch', 'book', 'lost', 'dreams', 'youth', 'film', 'changed', 'ending', 'too', 'awful', 'Zinaida', 'would', 'not', 'say']",N/A
