1248784,A1L135573YO6CW,B0021NSWIG,"John A. Rinaldi ""Dresser Guy""","[0, 1]","The main things that this film suffer from are bad writing, and the Joan Bennett part. Fred MacMurray is a successful middle aged man w/ his own company, a beautiful wife ( Joan Bennett)  3 children , nice home etc. But the lack of attention he gets at home starts to fuel a mid life crisis. He goes out of his way to  find some private time with his wife, but she is so ""busy"" with the never ending demands of children and house, that he finally gets fed up and when he reencounters a successful old flame from over 20 years ago, (STANWYCK) ,  he begins to contemplate dumping the family and beginning again w/ Stanwyck. Both MacMurray and Stanwyck are great to watch, but the 3 children's dialogue is SO pat and silly , you can almost vote for Dad to leave home!!  His attempts to explain his boredom and frustration to his wife are met with such stupid response, again, you can see him wanting to dump them.  This is where the writing is at fault.  Bennett, ( the wife) should have seen the unhappiness in her beloved husband and take a little time to address it. Most women who have loved and lived with a man can sense changes in mood or personality in the man; when he is begging for her to understand , she responds with a syrupy smile and suggests he get some rest. At one point , he states he is sick and tired of his life , the SAMENESS of it all. She never seems to treat his feelings as important and is always distracted by her rather obnoxious children.BUT, again, the plus side are  the scenes w/ Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck. Also, Stanwyck wears some of the most beautiful fashions she has ever worn in a film!!!",3,Stanwyck and MacMurray make the film,1368748800,"05 17, 2013",2013,1636,"['main', 'things', 'film', 'suffer', 'are', 'bad', 'writing', 'Joan', 'Bennett', 'part', 'Fred', 'MacMurray', 'successful', 'middle', 'aged', 'man', 'w/', 'own', 'company', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'Joan', 'Bennett', '3', 'children', 'nice', 'home', 'etc', 'lack', 'attention', 'home', 'starts', 'fuel', 'mid', 'life', 'crisis', 'way', 'find', 'private', 'time', 'wife', 'so', 'busy', 'never', 'ending', 'demands', 'children', 'house', 'finally', 'fed', 'up', 'when', 'successful', 'old', 'flame', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'STANWYCK', 'contemplate', 'dumping', 'family', 'beginning', 'again', 'w/', 'Stanwyck', 'MacMurray', 'Stanwyck', 'are', 'great', 'watch', '3', 'children', 'dialogue', 'SO', 'pat', 'silly', 'can', 'almost', 'vote', 'Dad', 'leave', 'home', 'attempts', 'explain', 'boredom', 'frustration', 'wife', 'are', 'met', 'such', 'stupid', 'response', 'again', 'can', 'see', 'wanting', 'dump', 'where', 'writing', 'fault', 'Bennett', 'wife', 'should', 'have', 'seen', 'unhappiness', 'beloved', 'husband', 'take', 'little', 'time', 'address', 'Most', 'women', 'who', 'have', 'loved', 'lived', 'man', 'can', 'sense', 'changes', 'mood', 'personality', 'man', 'when', 'begging', 'understand', 'syrupy', 'smile', 'get', 'rest', 'one', 'point', 'sick', 'tired', 'life', 'SAMENESS', 'never', 'treat', 'feelings', 'important', 'always', 'distracted', 'rather', 'obnoxious', 'children.BUT', 'again', 'plus', 'side', 'are', 'scenes', 'Fred', 'MacMurray', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'Also', 'Stanwyck', 'most', 'beautiful', 'fashions', 'ever', 'worn', 'film']",There's Always Tomorrow [Region 4]

1248786,A18SDN3HYFVH2L,B0021NSWIG,Muzzlehatch,"[2, 2]","The first of director Douglas Sirk's two 1956 films (the second is the ravishing TechinocorWritten on the Wind) is a black and white drama about a potential affair arising out of the meeting of old friends - or were they more than friends? Clifford Groves (Fred MacMurray) is a successful toy manufacturer in LA, with a seemingly good marriage to Marion (Joan Bennett) and three kids. But when Norma (Barbara Stanwyck), an ex-employee from his early days in business - and now a successful businesswoman herself, with a career that may be more exciting than Clifford's -  comes to visit while she's in town, his feelings of being ignored and taken for granted come to the fore, and the future of all may be up for grabs...This is an extraordinarily restrained and thoughtful piece of work; those who think of Sirk as soapy and over-the-top won't find too much of that behavior here - except, unfortunately, in William Reynolds as son Vinnie who seems to take the oedipal thing way too far in an otherwise fairly realistic film; he also seems to have a slightly different, sort of upper-crust accent, which threw things off a bit for me.  All three of the Groves kids seem in a sense to represent a conservative, critical and nosey sensibility, going at times well beyond the more placid attitudes of their mainstream, middle-class parents, and I think that while their roles and attitudes are important, there might just be a bit too much focus on them.  This is a minor problem though, and Sirk's mirroring of Vinnie's obsession with his father's at a couple of points is very well handled, as is the central theme of grass-is-always-greener and the notion that we can't really have everything - even when it seems like we've worked hard enough, and been lucky enough that we should.For my money this is every bit as good as the better=known color film from this same year, and it's one of Sirk's very best.  The ""restraint"" I mention above makes the central romantic issues if anything even more moving and powerful, and the film feels to me one of the more realistic portrayals of the flipside of our stereotyped 1950s sunshine and suburban paradise.  One of the late scenes between MacMurray (who gives I think his best performance here) and Stanwyck (pretty much as great as always) might have served as a model for another director known for a less-is-more approach - Clint Eastwood in a late scene inThe Bridges of Madison County, a film I was reminded of more than once here.  I'd be rather surprised if Clint hadn't seen this; whether he has or no, this film ranks alongside ""Bridges"" and ""Brief Encounter"" in the genre of thwarted adult romance.A word on this edition: alas, as of 2013 this masterpiece is still unavailable as a single disc here in the USA, it's country of origin.  If you can play R2 discs this Masters of Cinema edition is an excellent choice, with a beautifully crisp and detailed proper 1.85:1 transfer, and extras that include a fine wide-rangin hour-long discussion with the director (in English, French and German, with subtitles) from 1982 and a terrific booklet with a rather penetrating analysis by Andrew Klevan that certainly puts my meagre words to shame.  If you don't have R2 capability and/or are interested enough in Stanwyck to drop a bit of money on a few films at once, you can also get this as part of theThe Barbara Stanwyck Collectionwhich includes Sirk's ""All I Desire"" and this film and four others.  I don't have that set and so cannot vouch for the quality of transfer or anything else.",5,There's Always Trouble in Middle-Class Paradise,1381017600,"10 6, 2013",2013,3540,"['first', 'director', 'Douglas', 'Sirk', 'two', '1956', 'films', 'second', 'ravishing', 'TechinocorWritten', 'Wind', 'black', 'white', 'drama', 'potential', 'affair', 'arising', 'meeting', 'old', 'friends', 'were', 'more', 'friends', 'Clifford', 'Groves', 'Fred', 'MacMurray', 'successful', 'toy', 'manufacturer', 'LA', 'seemingly', 'good', 'marriage', 'Marion', 'Joan', 'Bennett', 'three', 'kids', 'when', 'Norma', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'ex-employee', 'early', 'days', 'business', 'now', 'successful', 'businesswoman', 'career', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'exciting', 'Clifford', 'visit', 'town', 'feelings', 'being', 'ignored', 'taken', 'granted', 'come', 'fore', 'future', 'may', 'be', 'up', 'grabs', 'extraordinarily', 'restrained', 'thoughtful', 'piece', 'work', 'who', 'think', 'Sirk', 'soapy', 'over-the-top', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'too', 'much', 'behavior', 'here', 'unfortunately', 'William', 'Reynolds', 'son', 'Vinnie', 'who', 'take', 'oedipal', 'thing', 'way', 'too', 'far', 'otherwise', 'fairly', 'realistic', 'film', 'also', 'have', 'slightly', 'different', 'sort', 'upper-crust', 'accent', 'threw', 'things', 'off', 'bit', 'three', 'Groves', 'kids', 'seem', 'sense', 'represent', 'conservative', 'critical', 'nosey', 'sensibility', 'going', 'times', 'well', 'more', 'placid', 'attitudes', 'mainstream', 'middle-class', 'parents', 'think', 'roles', 'attitudes', 'are', 'important', 'might', 'just', 'be', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'focus', 'minor', 'problem', 'Sirk', 'mirroring', 'Vinnie', 'obsession', 'father', 'couple', 'points', 'very', 'well', 'handled', 'central', 'theme', 'grass-is-always-greener', 'notion', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'everything', 'even', 'when', ""'ve"", 'worked', 'hard', 'enough', 'been', 'lucky', 'enough', 'should.For', 'money', 'bit', 'as', 'good', 'better=known', 'color', 'film', 'same', 'year', 'one', 'Sirk', 'very', 'best', 'restraint', 'mention', 'central', 'romantic', 'issues', 'anything', 'even', 'more', 'moving', 'powerful', 'film', 'feels', 'one', 'more', 'realistic', 'portrayals', 'flipside', 'stereotyped', '1950s', 'sunshine', 'suburban', 'paradise', 'One', 'late', 'scenes', 'MacMurray', 'who', 'think', 'best', 'performance', 'here', 'Stanwyck', 'pretty', 'much', 'as', 'great', 'always', 'might', 'have', 'served', 'model', 'director', 'known', 'less-is-more', 'approach', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'late', 'scene', 'inThe', 'Bridges', 'Madison', 'County', 'film', 'was', 'reminded', 'more', 'once', 'here', ""'d"", 'be', 'rather', 'surprised', 'Clint', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'Bridges', 'Brief', 'Encounter', 'genre', 'thwarted', 'adult', 'romance.A', 'word', 'edition', 'alas', '2013', 'masterpiece', 'still', 'unavailable', 'single', 'disc', 'here', 'USA', 'country', 'origin', 'can', 'play', 'R2', 'discs', 'Masters', 'Cinema', 'edition', 'excellent', 'choice', 'beautifully', 'crisp', 'detailed', 'proper', '1.85:1', 'transfer', 'extras', 'include', 'fine', 'wide-rangin', 'hour-long', 'discussion', 'director', 'English', 'French', 'German', 'subtitles', '1982', 'terrific', 'booklet', 'rather', 'penetrating', 'analysis', 'Andrew', 'Klevan', 'certainly', 'meagre', 'words', 'shame', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'R2', 'capability', 'and/or', 'are', 'interested', 'enough', 'Stanwyck', 'drop', 'bit', 'money', 'few', 'films', 'once', 'can', 'also', 'get', 'part', 'theThe', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'Collectionwhich', 'Sirk', 'All', 'Desire', 'film', 'four', 'others', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'set', 'so', 'can', 'not', 'vouch', 'quality', 'transfer', 'anything', 'else']",There's Always Tomorrow [Region 4]
1248787,A2R1GFS6P1PC18,B0021NSWIG,Peter Baklava,"[2, 2]","Douglas Sirk's ""There's Always Tomorrow"" is an unacknowledged precursor to modern films like ""American Beauty"".  But it is thoroughly singular in that it is pre-feminist in its sensibility.The plot, as summarized in other reviews, is very simple.  Fred MacMurray is Clifford Groves, a successful toy designer in Southern California, who lives a colorless life of a ""man in a grey-flannel suit"".  Barbara Stanwyck is Norma Vale, Clifford's former girlfriend, who has become a successful fashion designer with a brash style of her own in New York City.  Nevertheless, her personal life has been lacking, and when she returns to California for a visit and bumps into her old flame, the two flirt with the idea of rekindling their romance.  Clifford, though successfully married, with three children, has become inured to a drab, unappreciated existence.  Norma reawakens a touch of his zest for life.Clifford's oldest child, his son Vinnie, becomes suspicious of his father's rediscovered friendship.  Here is where the film assumes a slightly reactionary stance.  Clifford's three children, though hardly juvenile delinquents, are portrayed as spoiled infants.  This comes close to the attitude in Ayn Rand's 50's novel, ""Atlas Shrugged"", where children are chastised as ungrateful parasites.Vinnie, although his sins are basically being protective of his mother, and being influenced by such corruption as reading Theodore Dreiser (gasp), earns the opprobrium of his conservative fiancee.  When Vinnie finally comes around to seeing his father's point of view, she snaps ""Long pants at last!!""The conservatism of ""There's Always Tomorrow"" (from the literary pen of Ursula Parrott, a four-time divorcee and romance novelist), only serves to make it more unique.  Sirk is masterful at portraying Clifford as a prisoner of his comfortable existence.  Early on he shows MacMurray with an apron over his suit ( a symbol of emasculation that Nick Ray also used in ""Rebel Without A Cause""), and the camera focuses full square on the side-by-side, separate beds in Clifford's boudoir.  It's ""A Doll's House"", spun completely opposite from Ibsen.Barbara Stanwyk is the movie's scene stealer, effortlessly shifting into executive mode when the scene calls for it.  She has a completely commanding presence, and it's a wonder to behold her, when clad in a dashing ensemble, she hails a cab and leaves MacMurray standing haplessly in the rain.What a complete role reversal, and it takes an actress like Stanwyck to pull it off.  MacMurray, of course, was headed for further apron-donning as a paragon of patient fathering in television's ""My Three Sons"", which in retrospect nearly makes this movie seem emblematic.Ah, poor Fred...the downtrodden Dad.",5,"Oh Dad, Poor Dad",1368144000,"05 10, 2013",2013,2738,"['Douglas', 'Sirk', 'Always', 'Tomorrow', 'unacknowledged', 'precursor', 'modern', 'films', 'American', 'Beauty', 'thoroughly', 'singular', 'pre-feminist', 'sensibility.The', 'plot', 'summarized', 'other', 'reviews', 'very', 'simple', 'Fred', 'MacMurray', 'Clifford', 'Groves', 'successful', 'toy', 'designer', 'Southern', 'California', 'who', 'colorless', 'life', 'man', 'grey-flannel', 'suit', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'Norma', 'Vale', 'Clifford', 'former', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'become', 'successful', 'fashion', 'designer', 'brash', 'style', 'own', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Nevertheless', 'personal', 'life', 'been', 'lacking', 'when', 'California', 'visit', 'bumps', 'old', 'flame', 'two', 'flirt', 'idea', 'rekindling', 'romance', 'Clifford', 'successfully', 'married', 'three', 'children', 'become', 'inured', 'drab', 'unappreciated', 'existence', 'Norma', 'touch', 'zest', 'life.Clifford', 'oldest', 'child', 'son', 'Vinnie', 'suspicious', 'father', 'rediscovered', 'friendship', 'Here', 'where', 'film', 'slightly', 'reactionary', 'stance', 'Clifford', 'three', 'children', 'though', 'hardly', 'juvenile', 'delinquents', 'are', 'portrayed', 'spoiled', 'infants', 'close', 'attitude', 'Ayn', 'Rand', '50', 'novel', 'Atlas', 'Shrugged', 'where', 'children', 'are', 'chastised', 'ungrateful', 'parasites.Vinnie', 'sins', 'are', 'basically', 'being', 'protective', 'mother', 'being', 'influenced', 'such', 'corruption', 'reading', 'Theodore', 'Dreiser', 'gasp', 'opprobrium', 'conservative', 'fiancee', 'When', 'Vinnie', 'finally', 'seeing', 'father', 'point', 'view', 'Long', 'pants', 'last', 'conservatism', 'Always', 'Tomorrow', 'literary', 'pen', 'Ursula', 'Parrott', 'four-time', 'divorcee', 'romance', 'novelist', 'only', 'make', 'more', 'unique', 'Sirk', 'masterful', 'portraying', 'Clifford', 'prisoner', 'comfortable', 'existence', 'Early', 'MacMurray', 'apron', 'suit', 'symbol', 'emasculation', 'Nick', 'Ray', 'also', 'used', 'Rebel', 'A', 'Cause', 'camera', 'full', 'square', 'side-by-side', 'separate', 'beds', 'Clifford', 'boudoir', 'A', 'Doll', 'House', 'spun', 'completely', 'opposite', 'Ibsen.Barbara', 'Stanwyk', 'movie', 'scene', 'stealer', 'effortlessly', 'shifting', 'executive', 'mode', 'when', 'scene', 'completely', 'commanding', 'presence', 'wonder', 'behold', 'when', 'clad', 'dashing', 'ensemble', 'cab', 'MacMurray', 'standing', 'haplessly', 'rain.What', 'complete', 'role', 'reversal', 'actress', 'Stanwyck', 'pull', 'off', 'MacMurray', 'course', 'was', 'headed', 'further', 'apron-donning', 'paragon', 'patient', 'fathering', 'television', 'Three', 'Sons', 'retrospect', 'nearly', 'movie', 'seem', 'emblematic.Ah', 'poor', 'Fred', 'downtrodden', 'Dad']",There's Always Tomorrow [Region 4]
1248788,A3TSKC1CS6T4E6,B0021NSWIG,Sturgis,"[1, 2]","Sirk himself down-graded this film as an unsuccessfulattempt to carry through the unhappy ending  of the source novel of his earlier ""All I Desire."" Both films starred Barbara Stanwyck, but the studio had forced a happy ending on the earlier film. ""There's Always Tomorrow"" seems to me to have more of a kinship with ""All that Heaven Allows"" (1954), which immediately preceded it in Sirk's cannon. The titles of both films are savagely ironic. In both films, meddling grown children destroy or almost destroy a parent's chance for happiness. But there is more going on in ""There's Always Tomorrow."" The father, played by Fred MacMurray, is a successful toy manufacturer, who has never really grown up himself. Enter old flame Stanwyck, who terminated an earlier relationship with him. Stanwyck has made a successful career for herself and has grown up in the process. MacMurray's grown up children jump to the conclusion that they are having an affair, and, to protect their mother, confront the Stanwyck character. To tell more would spoil the plot, although there is never much suspense about how things are going to turn out. I disagree with Sirk's estimate that the film would have been better if shot, as originally planned, in color. The black and white photography conveys perfectly the colorless flatness of mid fifties ideal family life.As far as I know, this film is available in dvd only in the Barbara Stanwyck Universal Backlot set (which also has ""All I Desire"" and four other films) and a region 4 single film disc, which lists cast and crew interviews as extra materials. The region 4 disc is listed as having a 1:85 aspect, which considering the growing importance of mis en scene in Sirks mid and late fifties films, might be worth checking into for serious students who own a region zero player. But this one disc costs at least half again as much as the set, which has six films. I have not seen ""There's Always Tomorrow"" since its original release in 1955, or the region 4 disc at all, and so cannot comment on how important the aspect is for this film. All of the films in the set are in 1:33 aspect, which is fine for all the other films as they predate wide screen in Hollywood films.Seeing ""There's Always Tmorrow"" again, I must say I think it's time for Sirk scholars to reassess it. Sirk made a far better film than he seemed to remember when Jon Halliday interviewed him in 1971.
