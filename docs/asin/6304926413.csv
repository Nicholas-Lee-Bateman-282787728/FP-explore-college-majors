This makes me wonder if anything was cut out of the movie in the editing room. I think there was when I watch the film. It could have been so much more. What's left is a very brief and entertaining movie about a prison break. With very little Firestorm.Many people have said that Howie Long's performance in this film is quite poor. I think that he did a fine job. I can honestly say his performance is totally adequate. William Forsythe is quite a decent villain too. Neither hammy nor campy. I'm glad he was in the movie.But I'm not glad the film was a flop. It would have been a big hit if it was longer and had more plot. You can't call a film FIRESTORM and have only a few seconds worth of fire in it. I don't know what has been cut from this film but it has damaged it severely. Chris Soth is the only person credited with writing this film but rumor has it that Graeme Yost actually wrote the first draft but used his affiliation with the of the WGA to take if off after they hashed his script around too much.Although it is bare-boned and anorexic it is still a cool film to watch.It really would benefit from a Blu Ray release though.,3,"Dumb, brainless action but fun in a way",965001600,"07 31, 2000",2000,1188,"['movie', 'only', 'barely', '89', 'minutes', 'wonder', 'anything', 'was', 'cut', 'movie', 'editing', 'room', 'think', 'was', 'when', 'watch', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'What', 'left', 'very', 'brief', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'prison', 'break', 'very', 'little', 'Firestorm.Many', 'people', 'have', 'said', 'Howie', 'Long', 'performance', 'film', 'quite', 'poor', 'think', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'performance', 'totally', 'adequate', 'William', 'Forsythe', 'quite', 'decent', 'villain', 'too', 'hammy', 'campy', ""'m"", 'glad', 'was', 'movie.But', ""'m"", 'not', 'glad', 'film', 'was', 'flop', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'big', 'hit', 'was', 'longer', 'had', 'more', 'plot', 'ca', ""n't"", 'call', 'film', 'FIRESTORM', 'have', 'only', 'few', 'seconds', 'fire', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'been', 'cut', 'film', 'damaged', 'severely', 'Chris', 'Soth', 'only', 'person', 'credited', 'writing', 'film', 'rumor', 'Graeme', 'Yost', 'actually', 'wrote', 'first', 'draft', 'used', 'affiliation', 'WGA', 'take', 'off', 'hashed', 'script', 'around', 'too', 'much.Although', 'bare-boned', 'anorexic', 'still', 'cool', 'film', 'watch.It', 'really', 'would', 'benefit', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'release']",Firestorm VHS

However, with his buff bod, icy blue eyes and a hint of malevolent humor, he acquits himself quite nicely in this blazing adventure.  He plays the news fire chief of the Smoke Jumpers when buddy Scott Glenn is injured in a frightening opening rescue scene.  The pyrotechnics in this movie are awesome and heat up the screen (ha ha).  Suzy Amis is fun as the ornithologist who just happens to walk into the thick of things; William Forsythe is painfully effective as the cold-hearted killer who offs his prison escapee buddies so he can get all of his 37,000,000 dollars!

A for concept.As typical of the genre, this (Firestorm with Howie Long) is not a ""deep"" film and the plot is formulaic -- hero takes great risks but saves the girl and gets the ruthless bad guys who seem at times invincible. The acting is better than typical for the genre though not brilliant. The photography is very enjoyable.What is really wonderful is the forest-fire fighting context. There are not that many films that do a decent job of putting people in forest fire situations. We get to see here quite a lot of great shots of distant and near forests burning and can fairly well imagine what it can be like trying to get around in them and fight them. Of course fires differ a lot and there may not be a typical wildfire. But the shots are good. I dearly wish this DVD had come with a ""making of."" As one interested in film-making, it was not obvious and I feel it would have been worth letting us in.This is a terrific break from high-speed auto chases and all the other worn cliches in ""action films.""

439901,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,6304926413,trebe,"[0, 0]","Although a commercial flop, Firestorm (1998) is moderately entertaining, and features ex-football player Howie Long's first, and possibly last appearance, as the lead in an action movie.Drafted by the Raiders out of Villanova, Long had a Hall of Fame career in the NFL as a defensive lineman.  After his final appearance in the Pro Bowl at the end of the 1993 season, Long retired and went into broadcasting, working as an analyst for the FOX network.  Also interested in acting, Long turned in a strong performance in the action flick Broken Arrow (1996), before being selected to play Jesse Graves, a Colorado firefighter, in Firestorm.Prisoner Randall Shaye (William Forsythe) organizes and executes a plan to escape from prison.  Part of a work detail in the woods to fight a fire, Shaye and his accomplices ambush the guards, and take control.  Locking the guards and prisoners in a bus, Shaye and his group head into the woods, disguised as Canadian firefighters, and are soon joined by Jennifer (Suzy Amis), a bird researcher trapped by the fire.  Graves is in a plane assessing the course of the fire, when he spots Shaye's group headed for trouble, and parachutes down to help.  The fake firefighters soon show their true colors, and Jesse and Jennifer are soon on the run.Firestorm isn't terribly deep, sophisticated or realistic.  Until the very end, the fire is mostly a backdrop for the action.  The comic book type script, definitely benefits from William Forsythe's severely overdone performance as the greedy Randall Shaye, a man that takes great pleasure in killing his colleagues, to avoid sharing stolen loot.  Long's acting is far from polished, and his wide eyed stares are not always planned, but he is a very likeable guy, and does makes a very earnest effort.  The production apparently had to accommodate Long's schedule, as part of the film was supposedly shot during football season.  On weekends, Long had to fly from the film set to FOX's studios to cover the games.  Suzy Amis keeps things from being an all male affair, Scott Glenn appears as a firefighter, and Barry Pepper plays Shaye's longest lasting accomplice.Mostly confined to a burning forest, the action sequences though not spectacular, are nicely executed.  Really throwing an axe while swimming isn't easy!  What does not hold up well are the CGI special effects for the fire.  These sequences did not look very realistic in 1998, and are even less convincing now.  Parts of the final firestorm sequence look pretty fake and weak, although after Shaye makes a miraculous return from the dead, the matchhead scene is quite a nice touch.Whether it was the rigors of filming Firestorm, the film's poor box office performance, family concerns, or other reasons, Howie Long did not venture into the action genre again.  He continues to work as an analyst for FOX, and occasionally acts and appears in commercials.  Aside from highlights from his playing days, Firestorm is probably your best opportunity to see Howie in action in his prime.",3,"Olsen, Karas, Dryer, and then Howie Long . . .",1279324800,"07 17, 2010",2010,3029,"['commercial', 'flop', 'Firestorm', '1998', 'moderately', 'entertaining', 'ex-football', 'player', 'Howie', 'Long', 'first', 'possibly', 'last', 'appearance', 'lead', 'action', 'movie.Drafted', 'Raiders', 'Villanova', 'Long', 'had', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'career', 'NFL', 'defensive', 'lineman', 'final', 'appearance', 'Pro', 'Bowl', 'end', '1993', 'season', 'Long', 'retired', 'went', 'broadcasting', 'working', 'analyst', 'FOX', 'network', 'Also', 'interested', 'acting', 'Long', 'turned', 'strong', 'performance', 'action', 'flick', 'Broken', 'Arrow', '1996', 'being', 'selected', 'play', 'Jesse', 'Graves', 'Colorado', 'firefighter', 'Firestorm.Prisoner', 'Randall', 'Shaye', 'William', 'Forsythe', 'plan', 'escape', 'prison', 'Part', 'work', 'detail', 'woods', 'fight', 'fire', 'Shaye', 'accomplices', 'ambush', 'guards', 'take', 'control', 'Locking', 'guards', 'prisoners', 'bus', 'Shaye', 'group', 'head', 'woods', 'disguised', 'Canadian', 'firefighters', 'are', 'soon', 'joined', 'Jennifer', 'Suzy', 'Amis', 'bird', 'researcher', 'trapped', 'fire', 'plane', 'assessing', 'course', 'fire', 'when', 'spots', 'Shaye', 'group', 'headed', 'trouble', 'down', 'help', 'fake', 'firefighters', 'soon', 'show', 'true', 'colors', 'Jesse', 'Jennifer', 'are', 'soon', 'run.Firestorm', ""n't"", 'terribly', 'deep', 'sophisticated', 'realistic', 'very', 'end', 'fire', 'mostly', 'backdrop', 'action', 'comic', 'book', 'type', 'script', 'definitely', 'benefits', 'William', 'Forsythe', 'severely', 'overdone', 'performance', 'greedy', 'Randall', 'Shaye', 'man', 'great', 'pleasure', 'killing', 'colleagues', 'avoid', 'sharing', 'stolen', 'loot', 'Long', 'acting', 'far', 'polished', 'wide', 'eyed', 'stares', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'planned', 'very', 'likeable', 'guy', 'very', 'earnest', 'effort', 'production', 'apparently', 'had', 'accommodate', 'Long', 'schedule', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'supposedly', 'shot', 'football', 'season', 'weekends', 'Long', 'had', 'fly', 'film', 'set', 'FOX', 'studios', 'cover', 'games', 'Suzy', 'Amis', 'things', 'being', 'male', 'affair', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'firefighter', 'Barry', 'Pepper', 'Shaye', 'longest', 'lasting', 'accomplice.Mostly', 'confined', 'burning', 'forest', 'action', 'sequences', 'not', 'spectacular', 'are', 'nicely', 'executed', 'Really', 'throwing', 'axe', 'swimming', ""n't"", 'easy', 'What', 'not', 'hold', 'up', 'well', 'are', 'CGI', 'special', 'effects', 'fire', 'sequences', 'did', 'not', 'look', 'very', 'realistic', '1998', 'are', 'even', 'less', 'convincing', 'now', 'Parts', 'final', 'firestorm', 'sequence', 'look', 'pretty', 'fake', 'weak', 'Shaye', 'miraculous', 'return', 'dead', 'matchhead', 'scene', 'quite', 'nice', 'touch.Whether', 'was', 'rigors', 'filming', 'Firestorm', 'film', 'poor', 'box', 'office', 'performance', 'family', 'concerns', 'other', 'reasons', 'Howie', 'Long', 'did', 'not', 'venture', 'action', 'genre', 'again', 'work', 'analyst', 'FOX', 'occasionally', 'acts', 'commercials', 'Aside', 'highlights', 'playing', 'days', 'Firestorm', 'probably', 'best', 'opportunity', 'see', 'Howie', 'action', 'prime']",Firestorm VHS
