1497526,A1NIGUK4M2ST8,B005QIOK48,mk,"[11, 12]","This Christmas titled movie, taking place in non-snowing California, has all the right, at least on paper, elements for a hit family movie: a little romance, a little family tension to resolve, comedic pratfalls, lots of kids, narrating dogs(voiced by Jay Mohr and his wife Nikki Cox).The bowtied dog on the cover tells the tale, how his master, Brad Rowe(""General Hospital"" and another family film, ""Your Love Never Fails"") meets and proposes to the poodle's master, Jennifer Garth(""90210""); both are widowers; she has three boys, he, two girls.  Sounds like a ""Brady Bunch"" opportunity.What ensues is the engaged lovebirds struggle to plan and put together the wedding and deal with the mild problems of each others' families.  And mild it is.  This is basically a comedy.  At times the humor and sentiment feels forced.Veteran actors, Catherine Hicks and Tom Arnold provide important but fairly brief support.  Tom Arnold's on the phone for the bulk of the movie doing his humourous best.Pros and cons: the actors are fine; the movie's well shot and put together; nice settings, totally family clean.  We found the story somewhat flat, and it really isn't about the dogs.  They seemed like an afterthought or add-on, and we didn't find their voice overs that amusing.  Our kids(5&8) liked watching the dogs and that was about it.  Finally, most of the flick isn't about Christmas until near the end.The bonus features are almost non-existent- a quick summary of the movie by Jay Mohr.But overall, it's well intended, highlighting family, love and happy endings.  Enjoy for that.",3,"Family Friendly, Cute Dogs",1323475200,"12 10, 2011",2011,1581,"['Christmas', 'titled', 'movie', 'taking', 'place', 'non-snowing', 'California', 'right', 'least', 'paper', 'elements', 'hit', 'family', 'movie', 'little', 'romance', 'little', 'family', 'tension', 'resolve', 'comedic', 'pratfalls', 'lots', 'kids', 'narrating', 'dogs', 'voiced', 'Jay', 'Mohr', 'wife', 'Nikki', 'Cox', '.The', 'bowtied', 'dog', 'cover', 'tale', 'how', 'master', 'Brad', 'Rowe', 'General', 'Hospital', 'family', 'film', 'Love', 'Never', 'Fails', 'meets', 'poodle', 'master', 'Jennifer', 'Garth', '90210', 'are', 'widowers', 'three', 'boys', 'two', 'girls', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'ensues', 'engaged', 'lovebirds', 'struggle', 'plan', 'put', 'together', 'wedding', 'deal', 'mild', 'problems', 'others', 'families', 'mild', 'basically', 'comedy', 'times', 'humor', 'sentiment', 'feels', 'forced.Veteran', 'actors', 'Catherine', 'Hicks', 'Tom', 'Arnold', 'provide', 'important', 'fairly', 'brief', 'support', 'Tom', 'Arnold', 'phone', 'bulk', 'movie', 'doing', 'humourous', 'best.Pros', 'cons', 'actors', 'are', 'fine', 'movie', 'well', 'shot', 'put', 'together', 'nice', 'settings', 'totally', 'family', 'clean', 'found', 'story', 'somewhat', 'flat', 'really', ""n't"", 'dogs', 'seemed', 'afterthought', 'add-on', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'voice', 'overs', 'amusing', 'kids', '5', '8', 'liked', 'watching', 'dogs', 'was', 'Finally', 'most', 'flick', ""n't"", 'about', 'Christmas', 'end.The', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'almost', 'non-existent-', 'quick', 'summary', 'movie', 'Jay', 'Mohr.But', 'overall', 'well', 'intended', 'highlighting', 'family', 'love', 'happy', 'endings', 'Enjoy']","Christmas Wedding Tail, A"

Easley ""Opa""","[5, 5]",".For an appealing tale of romance, A Christmas Tail, is like a combination ofYours, Mine & OursandThe Parent Trap (1998)with the girls replaced by dogs.  The story is set in California during the Thanksgiving - Christmas holidays but it more about relationships than it is about Christmas.One day, while walking her dog, Rusty, Susan (Jennie Garth) bumps into Jake (Brad Rowe) and his dog Cheri.  The dogs fall in love and decide to manipulate their humans into marriage.Susan, a widow with three young boys, is looking for a job in her professional field as  curator of museums.  While her agent looks for a position, Susan moves to a small  town and helps her mother with an antique store.Jake, a widower with two girls, owns a winery in the valley where Susan's mother lives.He has an instant attraction to Susan and begins pursuing her.  Jake's daughters and Susan's sons, after several rejection scenes, very slowly begin to accept the match.This film is a family show.  The relationship difficulties are realistic and the plot acceptable to children and adults.  A Christmas Wedding Tail is a fun movie and I recommend it.",4,Wedding of Families,1325808000,"01 6, 2012",2012,1128,"['.For', 'appealing', 'tale', 'romance', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Tail', 'combination', 'ofYours', 'Mine', 'OursandThe', 'Parent', 'Trap', '1998', 'girls', 'replaced', 'dogs', 'story', 'set', 'California', 'Thanksgiving', 'Christmas', 'holidays', 'more', 'relationships', 'Christmas.One', 'day', 'walking', 'dog', 'Rusty', 'Susan', 'Jennie', 'Garth', 'Jake', 'Brad', 'Rowe', 'dog', 'Cheri', 'dogs', 'fall', 'love', 'decide', 'manipulate', 'humans', 'marriage.Susan', 'widow', 'three', 'young', 'boys', 'looking', 'job', 'professional', 'field', 'curator', 'museums', 'agent', 'position', 'Susan', 'small', 'town', 'mother', 'antique', 'store.Jake', 'widower', 'two', 'girls', 'winery', 'valley', 'where', 'Susan', 'mother', 'lives.He', 'instant', 'attraction', 'Susan', 'pursuing', 'Jake', 'daughters', 'Susan', 'sons', 'several', 'rejection', 'scenes', 'very', 'slowly', 'begin', 'accept', 'match.This', 'film', 'family', 'show', 'relationship', 'difficulties', 'are', 'realistic', 'plot', 'acceptable', 'children', 'adults', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Wedding', 'Tail', 'fun', 'movie', 'recommend']","Christmas Wedding Tail, A"
