1140435,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B0013AVNPW,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[0, 0]","So a group of college students perform a s&eacute;ance to communicate with the ghost of a young girl and accidentally open a spectral door for a malevolent spirit to come in.  Doesn't sound like much, does it?  Imagine my happy surprise when S&eacute;ance turned out to be a creepy and compelling horror film.  I'm not saying S&eacute;ance hits all the right buttons or earns itself a spot in the horror hall of fame, but this is by no means a bad or disappointing viewing experience.  There's obviously no pleasing the critics who described this movie as dull, unimaginative, and/or cheesy.  Painful to watch?  These critics couldn't be talking about the film I just saw.  I'll grant you that there are some clich&eacute;s in play here - the peeping tom security guy, the nerdy loner at the end of the hall, even the whole scenario of the ghostly little girl and the goofy s&eacute;ance.  On the other hand, not one of these horny coeds dies having sex, there is only the barest modicum of nudity, the plot never devolves into a brainless slasher film, and the story colors far outside the lines of any paint-by-numbers script I'm aware of.  They say the little ghost girl isn't creepy enough.  I suppose they would rather have a Japanese kid with layers of mascara around her eyes or horns on her head or something.  Don't most ghosts look like they looked before they died?  Just because the body's rotting in some grave doesn't mean the dead person's spirit has to have maggots crawling out of her eyes.Okay, let me stop defending this film long enough to briefly describe it.  Cute coed Lauren (Kandis Erickson) believes that her dorm room is haunted by the ghost of a little girl, but the fact that the bathroom sink turns on by itself and tubes of toothpaste tend to arrange themselves in a circle on the bathroom floor three times a week doesn't seem to bother her roommates Alison (Chauntal Lewis) and Melina (Tori White).  However, Lauren soon learns that Grant (Joel Geist), the weird and reclusive guy down the hall, has also seen the little girl - he has even identified her as a little girl that fell down the elevator shaft of the building forty years earlier.  Just for a lark, Alison's boyfriend Diego (A. J. Lamas) suggests they perform a s&eacute;ance to try and communicate with the alleged ghost.  That turns out to be a very bad idea, as the spirit they succeed in calling is not the little girl.This all takes place over the Thanksgiving holidays, when there are only six people in a 20+ story dorm locked up tighter than Jack Benny's wallet.  I think this virtually empty behemoth of a building adds much to the atmosphere, as does the periodic appearance of the ghost child.  Unfortunately, the special effects for the other ghost's appearances and disappearances are rather amateurish.  Another problem is the fact that the gang basically make up their own spirit-invoking rules as they go along.  The ending isn't exactly unpredictable, either, but the path the story took to that ending did pick up some tension and suspense along the way.  S&eacute;ance isn't going to make you jump out of your seat by any means, but it does sustain a level of disquiet in the background and is capable of invoking a few moments of creepiness.  The acting is much better than you'll find in most low-budget horror movies, and the few gory scenes are presented quite well indeed.  I hope horror fans will ignore the critics and give this film a chance.",4,A surprisingly effective and enjoyable little horror film,1285632000,"09 28, 2010",2010,3464,"['So', 'group', 'college', 'students', 'perform', 's', 'eacute', 'ance', 'communicate', 'ghost', 'young', 'girl', 'accidentally', 'open', 'spectral', 'door', 'malevolent', 'spirit', 'come', 'Does', ""n't"", 'sound', 'much', 'Imagine', 'happy', 'surprise', 'when', 'S', 'eacute', 'ance', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'creepy', 'compelling', 'horror', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'S', 'eacute', 'ance', 'right', 'buttons', 'spot', 'horror', 'hall', 'fame', 'bad', 'disappointing', 'viewing', 'experience', 'obviously', 'pleasing', 'critics', 'who', 'described', 'movie', 'dull', 'unimaginative', 'and/or', 'cheesy', 'Painful', 'watch', 'critics', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'talking', 'film', 'just', 'saw', ""'ll"", 'grant', 'are', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'play', 'here', 'peeping', 'tom', 'security', 'guy', 'nerdy', 'loner', 'end', 'hall', 'even', 'whole', 'scenario', 'ghostly', 'little', 'girl', 'goofy', 's', 'eacute', 'ance', 'other', 'hand', 'not', 'one', 'horny', 'coeds', 'dies', 'having', 'sex', 'only', 'barest', 'modicum', 'nudity', 'plot', 'never', 'brainless', 'slasher', 'film', 'story', 'colors', 'far', 'lines', 'paint-by-numbers', 'script', ""'m"", 'aware', 'say', 'little', 'ghost', 'girl', ""n't"", 'creepy', 'enough', 'suppose', 'would', 'rather', 'have', 'Japanese', 'kid', 'layers', 'mascara', 'eyes', 'horns', 'head', 'something', 'Do', ""n't"", 'most', 'ghosts', 'look', 'looked', 'died', 'Just', 'body', 'rotting', 'grave', ""n't"", 'mean', 'dead', 'person', 'spirit', 'have', 'maggots', 'crawling', 'eyes.Okay', 'let', 'stop', 'defending', 'film', 'long', 'enough', 'briefly', 'describe', 'Cute', 'coed', 'Lauren', 'Kandis', 'Erickson', 'dorm', 'room', 'haunted', 'ghost', 'little', 'girl', 'fact', 'bathroom', 'sink', 'tubes', 'toothpaste', 'tend', 'arrange', 'circle', 'bathroom', 'floor', 'three', 'times', 'week', ""n't"", 'seem', 'bother', 'roommates', 'Alison', 'Chauntal', 'Lewis', 'Melina', 'Tori', 'White', 'However', 'Lauren', 'soon', 'Grant', 'Joel', 'Geist', 'weird', 'reclusive', 'guy', 'down', 'hall', 'also', 'seen', 'little', 'girl', 'even', 'identified', 'little', 'girl', 'fell', 'down', 'elevator', 'shaft', 'building', 'forty', 'years', 'earlier', 'Just', 'lark', 'Alison', 'boyfriend', 'Diego', 'A.', 'J.', 'Lamas', 'perform', 's', 'eacute', 'ance', 'try', 'communicate', 'alleged', 'ghost', 'out', 'be', 'very', 'bad', 'idea', 'spirit', 'succeed', 'calling', 'not', 'little', 'girl.This', 'place', 'Thanksgiving', 'holidays', 'when', 'are', 'only', 'six', 'people', '20+', 'story', 'dorm', 'locked', 'up', 'tighter', 'Jack', 'Benny', 'wallet', 'think', 'virtually', 'empty', 'behemoth', 'building', 'much', 'atmosphere', 'periodic', 'appearance', 'ghost', 'child', 'Unfortunately', 'special', 'effects', 'other', 'ghost', 'appearances', 'disappearances', 'are', 'rather', 'amateurish', 'problem', 'fact', 'gang', 'basically', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'spirit-invoking', 'rules', 'go', 'along', 'ending', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'unpredictable', 'either', 'path', 'story', 'took', 'ending', 'did', 'pick', 'up', 'tension', 'suspense', 'way', 'S', 'eacute', 'ance', ""n't"", 'going', 'make', 'jump', 'seat', 'means', 'sustain', 'level', 'disquiet', 'background', 'capable', 'invoking', 'few', 'moments', 'creepiness', 'acting', 'much', 'better', ""'ll"", 'find', 'most', 'low-budget', 'horror', 'movies', 'few', 'gory', 'scenes', 'are', 'presented', 'quite', 'well', 'indeed', 'hope', 'horror', 'fans', 'will', 'ignore', 'critics', 'give', 'film', 'chance']",SÉance
1140436,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,B0013AVNPW,Einsatz,"[0, 0]","Another run-of-the-mill ghost story made by a filmmaker heavily influenced by better Japanese horror movies.  Whatever the inspiration, this film fails to scare because of a lack of imagination and a reliance on far too many horror clich&eacute;s (enough with the shower curtains!).  Now you see it, now you don't, is also a lame choice when it comes to fright.  I appreciate that it was a low budget project but ingenuity not finances makes something great.  Instead, what they came up with was an overly frugal plot involving 6 people stuck in a building for the holidays.  On a whim, they decide to hold a s&eacute;ance.  I don't know when a s&eacute;ance is ever a good idea but these people thought it was and rely on the lack of expertise on the part of the dumbest member of their group to call up a ghost already in residence.  As a result, they end up with a psychotic ghost with no clear agenda played with stupefying inertness by Adrian Paul.  All in all, very few in the way of actual chills: adequate performances by most, a sloppy ending, basic FX, some humor, and it was mercifully brief at 88 minutes.I've seen better and a lot worse.

1140442,A2D1F0HWHN4T1U,B0013AVNPW,Robert,"[22, 22]","I'm surprised there hasn't been more interest in this film, considering it does a nice job in maintaining some suspense and has a few chills thrown in for good measure. The story is an intriguing one, involving an old apartment building being renovated for a college dorm. The building's history involves a sordid past that left restless spirits revisiting the scenes of their shared history. The few college kids (of course) left behind over break make the mistake of holding a seance, unleashing unforseen horror that they spend most of the movie trying to explain and escape. The story is an interesting one, the pace more than reasonable, and the mood is worthy of a late night ghost story with the lights out.I don't want to overrate the film, but for a straight to DVD release, it is a worthy rental. There are only a few characters, and their development is virtually nonexistent, but that is not what the film is about. The real concern is the story of the haunting and the history of the building, and it is fairly well executed. You'll want to avoid injecting too much logic into it, or you'll ruin the fun. This is nothing more than a little ghost story to go along with the popcorn, and it is satisfying at that level. Don't expect too much blood or special effects, as the budget obviously doesn't allow for it. And the acting is less than stellar, but it never reaches the laughable stage that horror fans sometimes have to endure.
