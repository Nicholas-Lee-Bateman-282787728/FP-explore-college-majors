995657,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B000FTCF9A,Enjolras,"[0, 0]","Commander in Chief is obviously attempt to ride the wake of the success of West Wing. Unfortunately, it didn't quite succeed. I can see why. It's a good how, but has some flaws. Here's the rundown:GOODThe acting is all around strong. Of course, Geena Davis gives a strong performance as the first female president with a mixture of strength and motherliness. Donald Sutherland as her arch-nemesis Speaker Nathan Templeton is brilliant, combining regal dignity with deviousness. All of the characters are multifaceted and most have a realistic mix of motivations. Even Templeton is never portrayed as simply a villain but rather a politician who believes the country would be better off with him as president.I also appreciate that the plot lines don't become two ridiculous (with one or two exceptions). It's tempting for a show like this to simply feature a foreign or political crisis every week, but Commander in Chief doesn't overdo these.BADI think the biggest problem with the show is its self-righteousness. The show always portrays the president as morally and politically superior to anybody around her. Her policies are portrayed as the right ones, even when they're questionable (particularly the first episode, which seems to endorse a vision of American imperialism and interventionism). She always finds some out-of-the-box policy solution to outwit her opponents. However, I think the show would have been more interesting if we see the president or her team trip up occaisionally.Another issue is that the president is both the first female president and a political independent. It's a bit too much and the show sometimes seemed undecided as to which aspect to emphasize. Especially after the 2008 election, it's pretty easy to imagine a female president. However, an independent is less realistic and the show doesn't quite pull it off. More often it becomes the president against the Republicans.The show isn't quite as wonky as West Wing. More of the episodes focus on the first family. Obviously, this is natural with the first female president, but I can understand why much of the West Wing audience didn't care much for the episode where the teens go wild in the White House.UGLYA few episodes in the second season went far off the deep end. The Democrats poison the first gentleman, Speaker Templeton serves as acting president for a day and goes power crazy, and a terrorist threatens to blow up Air Force One. It seems like the producers wanted to raise the ratings by throwing in some plot twists, but it comes off looking too much like Desperate Housewives.Overall, it's a good show, but I can see why it was never great.",4,Good not great,1325808000,"01 6, 2012",2012,2650,"['Commander', 'Chief', 'obviously', 'attempt', 'ride', 'wake', 'success', 'West', 'Wing', 'Unfortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'succeed', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'good', 'how', 'flaws', 'Here', 'rundown', 'GOODThe', 'acting', 'strong', 'course', 'Geena', 'Davis', 'strong', 'performance', 'first', 'female', 'president', 'mixture', 'strength', 'motherliness', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'arch-nemesis', 'Speaker', 'Nathan', 'Templeton', 'brilliant', 'combining', 'regal', 'dignity', 'deviousness', 'characters', 'are', 'multifaceted', 'most', 'have', 'realistic', 'mix', 'motivations', 'Even', 'Templeton', 'never', 'portrayed', 'simply', 'villain', 'rather', 'politician', 'who', 'country', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'off', 'president.I', 'also', 'appreciate', 'plot', 'lines', 'do', ""n't"", 'become', 'two', 'ridiculous', 'one', 'two', 'exceptions', 'tempting', 'show', 'simply', 'feature', 'foreign', 'political', 'crisis', 'week', 'Commander', 'Chief', ""n't"", 'overdo', 'these.BADI', 'think', 'biggest', 'problem', 'show', 'self-righteousness', 'show', 'always', 'president', 'morally', 'politically', 'superior', 'anybody', 'policies', 'are', 'portrayed', 'right', 'ones', 'even', 'when', ""'re"", 'questionable', 'particularly', 'first', 'episode', 'endorse', 'vision', 'American', 'imperialism', 'interventionism', 'always', 'out-of-the-box', 'policy', 'solution', 'outwit', 'opponents', 'However', 'think', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'interesting', 'see', 'president', 'team', 'trip', 'occaisionally.Another', 'issue', 'president', 'first', 'female', 'president', 'political', 'independent', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'show', 'sometimes', 'seemed', 'undecided', 'aspect', 'emphasize', 'Especially', '2008', 'election', 'pretty', 'easy', 'imagine', 'female', 'president', 'However', 'independent', 'less', 'realistic', 'show', ""n't"", 'quite', 'pull', 'off', 'More', 'often', 'president', 'Republicans.The', 'show', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'wonky', 'West', 'Wing', 'More', 'episodes', 'focus', 'first', 'family', 'Obviously', 'natural', 'first', 'female', 'president', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'much', 'West', 'Wing', 'audience', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'episode', 'where', 'teens', 'go', 'wild', 'White', 'House.UGLYA', 'few', 'episodes', 'second', 'season', 'went', 'far', 'deep', 'end', 'Democrats', 'poison', 'first', 'gentleman', 'Speaker', 'Templeton', 'acting', 'president', 'day', 'power', 'crazy', 'terrorist', 'threatens', 'blow', 'up', 'Air', 'Force', 'One', 'producers', 'wanted', 'raise', 'ratings', 'throwing', 'plot', 'twists', 'off', 'looking', 'too', 'much', 'Desperate', 'Housewives.Overall', 'good', 'show', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'was', 'never', 'great']",N/A

The Female President Mackenzie Allen is played superbly by Geena Davis, who does an amazing job in demonstrating how a female would handle difficult situations. For us, this series has become a favorite to watch with teenagers, stopping the DVD at every question to ensure understanding of government, politics, and acronyms. A superb learning tool.The situations are excellent, the acting, especially by Davis and the Speaker of the House Nathan Templeton, played by Donald Sutherland. As usual, Sutherland is simply magnificent playing a bad guy, in this case a deceptively genial snake, who is after the power of the presidency, thinking that Davis will be easy to beat, but at every turn realizing that ""she is a force to be reckoned with"" and ""smart as a wip!""Kyle Secor plays the First Gentleman, and he too provides a candid view as to the difficulties a man would encounter if ever in this situation. The staff players are all amazingly interesting, with us hating and loving the White House official and political consultant Dickie McDonald, played by Mark-Paul Gosselaar.Don't know why this series went off the air, but we sincerely hope it is resurrected.

995660,A3IM77LLZAN8B6,B000FTCF9A,J. W. Hickey,"[4, 4]","Back during its original hopscotch run all over primetime, there was so much gossipy scuffle about ABC's incompetent handling of C-IN-C  that I inferred the quality of the episodes suffered after Bochco took over control from its initiator Rod Lurie.  But all of the episodes except the last retain the quality of the contents of the first DVD set.My problems with the final episode mainly involve a forming plot line that was as improbable when WEST WING also adopted it.  When Nixon lost Agnew, can one really imagine his party not looking for a VP candidate in a state that would bring delegate votes, but instead deciding on making Ehrlichman or Halderman the new VP?That BOTH presidency TV series selected the sitting president's internal employee as a VP candidate always seemed lazy and far-fetched.  On the surface, both men bring qualities that presume America is brighter, more liberal, and less assaultive than the realities of our history suggest. (In the era of torture in war, how does one account for America's embrace of HOSTEL and the SAW franchise?) On WW the VP candidate is an alcoholic with a serious heart condition; on C-IN-C he's a Black mensch who abandoned his own party to graft onto a woman Independent.  We in the audience appreciate the sensitivity, loyalty, and complexity of both VP choices, but would political parties really not insist on a more pragmatic (and probably less sterling) candidate from a section of the country that is more lucrative to electoral college concerns, and someone the American public already knows from (probably) ""his"" record as a governor or member of Congress?Late C-IN-C showed other signs of WING weariness.  The teen daughter's budding romance with someone in the political opposition was another WEST WING echo, and the OTHER candidates for VP included a Jimmy Smits clone.  So, my enthusiasm for the second DVD flagged a bit as President Allen's decision-making began to look flaky for the convenience of the writers and as situations began to plow territory similar to WING.If memory serves, Allen defends reintroducing ERA legislation by citing a sage homily:  Once your hands are on the plow, don't let go until you've reached the end of the row.  Given the VP and other situations budding in the last episode here, the series ended at the end of its row.Okay, so now our appetites have been whetted by an excellent (but cancelled) politics series, how about DVD-ing Rob Lowe's LYON'S DEN?",4,mostly as good as the DVD,1174521600,"03 22, 2007",2007,2461,"['Back', 'original', 'hopscotch', 'run', 'primetime', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'gossipy', 'scuffle', 'ABC', 'incompetent', 'handling', 'C-IN-C', 'inferred', 'quality', 'episodes', 'suffered', 'Bochco', 'took', 'over', 'control', 'initiator', 'Rod', 'Lurie', 'episodes', 'last', 'retain', 'quality', 'contents', 'first', 'DVD', 'set.My', 'problems', 'final', 'episode', 'mainly', 'involve', 'forming', 'plot', 'line', 'was', 'improbable', 'when', 'WEST', 'WING', 'also', 'adopted', 'When', 'Nixon', 'lost', 'Agnew', 'can', 'one', 'really', 'imagine', 'party', 'not', 'looking', 'VP', 'candidate', 'state', 'would', 'bring', 'delegate', 'votes', 'instead', 'deciding', 'making', 'Ehrlichman', 'Halderman', 'new', 'VP', 'BOTH', 'presidency', 'TV', 'series', 'selected', 'sitting', 'president', 'internal', 'employee', 'VP', 'candidate', 'always', 'seemed', 'lazy', 'far-fetched', 'surface', 'men', 'bring', 'qualities', 'presume', 'America', 'brighter', 'more', 'liberal', 'less', 'assaultive', 'realities', 'history', 'suggest', 'era', 'torture', 'war', 'how', 'one', 'account', 'America', 'embrace', 'HOSTEL', 'SAW', 'franchise', 'WW', 'VP', 'candidate', 'alcoholic', 'serious', 'heart', 'condition', 'C-IN-C', 'Black', 'mensch', 'who', 'abandoned', 'own', 'party', 'graft', 'woman', 'Independent', 'audience', 'appreciate', 'sensitivity', 'loyalty', 'complexity', 'VP', 'choices', 'would', 'political', 'parties', 'really', 'not', 'insist', 'more', 'pragmatic', 'probably', 'less', 'sterling', 'candidate', 'section', 'country', 'more', 'lucrative', 'electoral', 'college', 'concerns', 'someone', 'American', 'public', 'already', 'probably', 'record', 'governor', 'member', 'Congress', 'Late', 'C-IN-C', 'showed', 'other', 'signs', 'WING', 'weariness', 'teen', 'daughter', 'budding', 'romance', 'someone', 'political', 'opposition', 'was', 'WEST', 'WING', 'echo', 'OTHER', 'candidates', 'VP', 'included', 'Jimmy', 'Smits', 'clone', 'So', 'enthusiasm', 'second', 'DVD', 'flagged', 'bit', 'President', 'Allen', 'decision-making', 'began', 'look', 'flaky', 'convenience', 'writers', 'situations', 'began', 'plow', 'territory', 'similar', 'WING.If', 'memory', 'serves', 'Allen', 'reintroducing', 'ERA', 'legislation', 'citing', 'sage', 'homily', 'Once', 'hands', 'are', 'plow', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', ""'ve"", 'reached', 'end', 'row', 'Given', 'VP', 'other', 'situations', 'budding', 'last', 'episode', 'here', 'series', 'ended', 'end', 'row.Okay', 'so', 'now', 'appetites', 'have', 'been', 'whetted', 'excellent', 'cancelled', 'politics', 'series', 'how', 'DVD-ing', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'LYON', 'DEN']",N/A

995663,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000FTCF9A,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[5, 21]","""Commander in Chief,"" ABC's 2005-06 series starring Geena Davis as Mackenzie Allen, the first woman president of the United States, started off like a sure fire hit and then went slowly but steadily down in the ratings. The show had three different producers, starting with creator Rob Lurie, who helmed the first three episodes, followed by Stephen Bochco, and finally Dee Johnson. However, the vision of the show remained the same, which was to put a woman in the Oval Office and stack the deck against her at each and every opportunity. Obviously the show was compared to ""The West Wing,"" which also offered a look at politics from the perspective of the White House, and provides an interesting perspective for today's post mortem.The flaw in ""The West Wing"" was the office of the Vice President. In these modern times no President is going to take a Senator from a state like Texas, who was his party's presumptive nominee, and ignore him the way Jed Bartlet did John Hoynes. Then, adding insult to injury, the show had the Republican Speaker of the House force Bartlet to nominee Bob Russell, basically a joke candidate from Congress, so that there would not be a strong Veep positioned to replace Bartlet. The real Congress deal with having a qualified vice president who would not run for re-election when they picked Nelson Rockerfeller and the idea the Republicans would push for and consent to a qualified Vice President a heartbeat away from a President with MS is despicable. But that it nothing compared to what Republicans do on ""Commander in Chief.""I watched this series just to see how much it would infuriate me each week with its depiction of how politics is played. The nadir of the series is reached in Episode 16, ""The Elephant in the Room."" President Allen suffers a burst appendix and has to be operated on. Her Vice President resigned in the previous episode, and just like on ""The West Wing,"" something happens that forces the Speaker of the House to temporarily be President. But here we are talking about Nathan Templeton (Donald Sutherland), who has never forgiven Allen for not stepping down when the previous president died and letting him become president. There is a crippling airline strike going on and Allen has been trying to negotiate a settlement that will actually work and not lead to another strike down the road. As acting president Templeton solves the problem the way he wants.Now, when ""The West Wing"" had this situation Josh Lyman went off the deep end accusing the Republicans of wanting to exploit the situation (the kidnapping of Zoey Bartlet) to push through their agenda. His Republican counterpart shot back, ""We're not stupid, Josh. We try to use this to our advantage, it will blow up in our faces. We'd seem callous and unfeeling . . . And anyone who thinks otherwise has a particularly craven way of looking at politics."" Well, ""Commander in Chief"" proved exactly that point in this episode, but their craven way of looking at politics is found throughout the entire series and not just these last eight episodes.Davis did not deserve to have an opportunity like this ruined because the people who put together this show keep deciding that having a villain like Templeton, whose primary object each week as Speaker of the House was to damage the President in any way possible. In Episode 13, ""State of the Unions,"" somebody supporting Templeton's side slips the ""First Gentleman"" a mickey so that they can publicly embarrass him and the president. Apparently there are no limits to what Republicans will do and because the title character is not a Democrat but an Independent, the show thinks it has insulated itself from attacks for being liberal apologists. However, Allen revives the Equal Rights Amendment in the final episode, which in some circles would get the whole duck comparison thingy going.The funny part, such as it is, would be that the Washington Press Corp never notices anything that Templeton and his cronies are doing, let along calling them on it. They just roll over and play dead for Templeton, but challenge everything and anything Allen does. I know this is just another indication of how far over the rainbow this show ended up going, but if you whole thesis is that a woman can be president, then it would be nice if the United States she was being president of bore more than a passing resemblance to our own.Episode 18, ""Unfinished Business,"" was the final one and they actually made some smart movies here as Allen decides that she will run for president by doing her job and never campaigning. If we are going to totally avoid reality, then this is an interesting way of doing it. Of course, when the show has been cancelled and you are wrapping things up you can be bold, say like having three of your kids announce they are having twins. This ""7th Heaven"" reference is not gratuitous, because they got renewed after their ""final"" episode and at this point a ""Commander in Chief"" television movie has apparently been confirmed. I could hope for something different for the encore, but I fully expect more of the same. What a wasted opportunity.",3,A particularly craven way of looking at American politics draws to a close,1152748800,"07 13, 2006",2006,5133,"['Commander', 'Chief', 'ABC', '2005-06', 'series',

It is not about a person who tries to win a 5 or 6-figure money, job, or love on most of reality TV shows, but offers a lot more. This is one show which is portrayed and produced the closest to our reality as a nation. Granted that a female president is running the country, but other parts of the world are already on line with this concept. I am not sure about others, but if there is a commander-in-chief like the TV show, I would not have any problem following such a leader.

995666,AOK72ELBI86GF,B000FTCF9A,Poker Face,"[15, 17]","Yes, this is basically West Wing light,with good enough acting overall,though I still think Geena Davis(first female President of the United States) only truly shines in the very first episode of the series(which is also on this Part 2 DVD,but this time with the choice of listening to show creator Rod Lurie's commentary or not).It could perhaps be because that happens to be my favorite episode.She's fine in the other episodes but I enjoy watching the rest of the First Family much more.Geena Davis' character is under so much pressure as the President of the United States,that she rarely gets a chance to flash her great smile and showcase her friendly nature.I like all of the First Family actors,and also like the way this series mostly focuses on their relationships with each other rather than getting too deep into political issues.Both the eldest daughter,played by Caitlin Wachs, and the the youngest daughter,played by Jasmine Anthony, are top-notch and greatly add to the show.Matt Lanter(son) and Kyle Secor(husband) are both solid as well.Later on in the series,the grandmother is added to help keep the family more secure.Both Ever Carradine(Robert Carradine's daughter),who plays  press secretary Kelly Ludlow and Harry J. Lennix who plays Chief of Staff Jim Gardner are both great additions to an already stellar cast.Any political issues discussed in this 18 episode series(only episode #1 and episodes #11-18 are on these 2 discs from Part 2) are very basic and most have been done in much more detail on the far superior West Wing(this is also what creator Rod Lurie says on his commmentary track;so we agree).Notes:-Luckily,the final episode doesn't end in a cliff-hanger,but rather sets up the upcoming battle for re-election against a worthy opponent.-There will also be an upcoming Commander In Chief Tv movie that I heard Geena Davis mention,when she was being interviewed on The View Tv show,fairly recently.-The President's son played by Matt Lanter was actually CGI'd (his face was placed over the other actor's face using Computer Generated Imagery),into some scenes from the pilot episode because he replaced the initial actor they hired(since they later decided he didn't look good enough-as I learned from Rod Lurie's good audio commentary).-In episode #17 @ 18:38 point in the episode,the Chief of Staff wryly says,""I'm betting this President can handle a bow and arrow"",obviously referring to Geena Davis placing 24th out of 28 semi-finalists for the Olympic Archery team in 1999.-Geena Davis can speak Swedish and is a member of Mensa (her IQ is 140). My IQ is very near 45 on a good day.DVD EXTRAS:-A Conversation with Madame President: An OK interview with Geena Davis,featuring her nice smile and friendly nature along with some insight;as well as some clips from the show interspersed between her comments (5 minutes and 53 seconds in length).GRADE: C+-Deleted Scenes: 20 deleted scenes(21minutes and 38 seconds in length) taken from some of the 18 episodes of the entire series.Most are short but sweet,with only a few perhaps that shouldn't have been deleted from the actual episodes.Thankfully, there is a 'Play All' deleted scenes choice.GRADE: C+-White House Humor,Bloopers and Outtakes:You get to see Geena Davis clown around and make faces before she starts her scenes,as well as seeing many other cast regulars make mistakes.Nothing hilarious,but still funny and enjoyable.I'm sure you'll at least chuckle from time to time and wish there was more than just the 3 minutes and 35 seconds of it.GRADE: B MINUS-Audio Commentary for Episode #1-commentary by show creator Rod Lurie: As mentioned before, they included episode #1(the pilot) on this Part 2 DVD set(you can only access it from the Special Features:Commentary section),so they could add Rod Lurie's fine and informative commentary.You learn some behind the scenes secrets(such as Matt Lanter replacing the initial actor chosen for role), roughly what goes into getting a pilot ready for Tv and get to hear some very opinionated comments by Rod Lurie as well.He did however mention that he didn't want to get into any scandalous issues about the show,but still I learned enough from his commentary to recommend it.GRADE: B-Audio Commentary for Episode #16:Elephant in the Room-commentary  by writer/producer Dee Johnson: Informative enough but still dull at times.GRADE: CSUMMARY:I enjoyed the entire 18 episode series(only episode #1 and episodes #11-18 are on this DVD Season 1 Part 2 set)of Commander In Chief,with episode #1 being my favorite.I also enjoyed all the episodes that focused on the President's children.Unfortunately,having seen the far superior West Wing Tv series as well,Commander In Chief pales in comparison.However,the lighter nature of Commander In Chief makes it a more relaxing and less cerebral minded show that focuses more on family values,as well as how a close-knit family deals with being in the spotlight 24 hours a day,without completely falling apart.It has a strong heart and enough solid acting to keep you rooting for this First Family and all those they care about.God Bless America (and Canada too).OVERALL GRADE(WITHOUT Dvd Extras): BOVERALL GRADE(WITH Dvd Extras): B+",3,West Wing Light.,1157673600,"09 8, 2006",2006,5215,"['Yes', 'basically', 'West', 'Wing', 'light',
