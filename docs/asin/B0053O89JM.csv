1438631,A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,B0053O89JM,"Christopher Barrett ""Evil Corgi""","[0, 0]","The main issue I had with season 7 was the same issue I had with the first part of this season. The writers began focusing so much on the stories of the main characters, that they didn't spend time on the cases. Instead, the cases seemed to be an afterthought, just tacked on to keep the long time faithfuls (like myself) on board. Though this season wasn't the train wreck season 4 was, we do get back on track somewhat, as long as you can suspend your belief somewhat.I'll explain that last statement. A doctor has a nervous breakdown, does to prison, and is out on parole. How is it possible to renew your medical license at that point? While still on parole? I understand that the hospital made a deal with the prison, but the American Medical Association wouldn't have allowed that. Not to mention malpractice insurance nightmares. And when House has the new girl on board, she starts actually assisting and doing procedures while not being officially employed by the hospital (which means legally she would have to be a resident or employee and have malpractice insurance). But the series has never really been authentic in those aspects, though the cases tend to be more realistic, and often based on real life medical facts. The space age lung machine? It's real. Though it's a dome shape, not square. I guess they had to do square to keep from having the film crew reflected in the dome.The first two episodes are tortuous for a long time House fan. They tend to be off in the more 'mainstream' drama realm. Hugh Laurie even seems to be phoning it in during these first couple. And once House is practicing again, we see the constant threat of 'go back to jail'. It gets kind of off putting. Once he loses the ankle bracelet I wanted to scream with relief. But even then we still get Foreman and others threatening House every 10 minutes or so.Taub gets more interesting in this season, which is great since I've always kind of liked him. We also get two new doctors, one annoys me nonstop (Adams - not a good replacement for Olivia Wilde - sorry), the other is more realistic as a doctor (Park - aka Bookie Monster - you'll see). There is an incident with Chase about midway through, and I was really kind of put off by that story arc (again going with the more mainstream drama events). It never quite gets melodramatic though. Not Gray's Anatomy area anyway.It's fitting end to the series, and though it has it's ups and downs, it still resembles the show it started as, which is uncommon nowadays. Though seasons 1 - 3 were rock solid, seasons 5 - 8 have been good, though not without their ups and downs. This series is still more realistic in the medical cases than ER was or Gray's Anatomy.Understandably shows tend to get more involved with their characters as the series progresses. It is the only reason I find seasons 1 -3 better than the rest. Still great drama, but just a little too much personal 'drama' in later seasons.Oh, and the constant Ford promos get very irritating. When a character says ""Hey, don't take these corners that fast"" and the other answers ""It's okay with this car's new something something handling system,"" yeah, it's lame. Or the zoom in on the dashboard of Wilson's Ford. And always a big shot of the Ford logo. These scenes are unnecessary and actually serve to put a big brake on the flow. So much that each time I was tempted to turn off the show.----There are a few nice special features at the end of the series worth watching. There is a little video montage by Laurie which is quite fun.",4,"Better than the last few seasons, a good way to end ~",1346803200,"09 5, 2012",2012,3543,"['main', 'issue', 'had', 'season', '7', 'was', 'same', 'issue', 'had', 'first', 'part', 'season', 'writers', 'began', 'focusing', 'so', 'much', 'stories', 'main', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'spend', 'time', 'cases', 'Instead', 'cases', 'seemed', 'be', 'afterthought', 'just', 'tacked', 'keep', 'long', 'time', 'faithfuls', 'board', 'season', 'was', ""n't"", 'train', 'wreck', 'season', '4', 'was', 'do', 'get', 'back', 'track', 'somewhat', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'suspend', 'belief', 'somewhat.I', ""'ll"", 'explain', 'last', 'statement', 'doctor', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'prison', 'out', 'parole', 'How', 'possible', 'renew', 'medical', 'license', 'point', 'still', 'parole', 'understand', 'hospital', 'made', 'deal', 'prison', 'American', 'Medical', 'Association', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'allowed', 'Not', 'mention', 'malpractice', 'insurance', 'nightmares', 'when', 'House', 'new', 'girl', 'board', 'actually', 'assisting', 'doing', 'procedures', 'not', 'being', 'officially', 'employed', 'hospital', 'legally', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'resident', 'employee', 'have', 'malpractice', 'insurance', 'series', 'never', 'really', 'been', 'authentic', 'aspects', 'cases', 'tend', 'be', 'more', 'realistic', 'often', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'medical', 'facts', 'space', 'age', 'lung', 'machine', 'real', 'dome', 'shape', 'not', 'square', 'guess', 'had', 'do', 'square', 'keep', 'having', 'film', 'crew', 'reflected', 'dome.The', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', 'are', 'tortuous', 'long', 'time', 'House', 'fan', 'tend', 'be', 'off', 'more', ""'mainstream"", 'drama', 'realm', 'Hugh', 'Laurie', 'even', 'be', 'phoning', 'first', 'couple', 'once', 'House', 'practicing', 'again', 'see', 'constant', 'threat', ""'go"", 'back', 'jail', 'kind', 'off', 'putting', 'Once', 'ankle', 'bracelet', 'wanted', 'scream', 'relief', 'even', 'then', 'still', 'get', 'Foreman', 'others', 'threatening', 'House', '10', 'minutes', 'so.Taub', 'more', 'interesting', 'season', 'great', ""'ve"", 'always', 'kind', 'liked', 'also', 'get', 'two', 'new', 'doctors', 'one', 'nonstop', 'Adams', 'not', 'good', 'replacement', 'Olivia', 'Wilde', 'sorry', 'other', 'more', 'realistic', 'doctor', 'Park', 'aka', 'Bookie', 'Monster', ""'ll"", 'see', 'incident', 'Chase', 'midway', 'was', 'really', 'kind', 'put', 'off', 'story', 'arc', 'again', 'going', 'more', 'mainstream', 'drama', 'events', 'never', 'quite', 'melodramatic', 'Not', 'Gray', 'Anatomy', 'area', 'anyway.It', 'fitting', 'end', 'series', 'ups', 'downs', 'still', 'show', 'started', 'uncommon', 'nowadays', 'seasons', '1', '3', 'were', 'rock', 'solid', 'seasons', '5', '8', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'not', 'ups', 'downs', 'series', 'still', 'more', 'realistic', 'medical', 'cases', 'ER', 'was', 'Gray', 'Anatomy.Understandably', 'tend', 'get', 'more', 'involved', 'characters', 'series', 'only', 'reason', 'find', 'seasons', '1', '-3', 'better', 'rest', 'Still', 'great', 'drama', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'personal', ""'drama"", 'later', 'seasons.Oh', 'constant', 'Ford', 'promos', 'get', 'very', 'irritating', 'When', 'character', 'Hey', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'corners', 'fast', 'other', 'answers', 'okay', 'car', 'new', 'something', 'something', 'handling', 'system', 'yeah', 'lame', 'zoom', 'dashboard', 'Wilson', 'Ford', 'always', 'big', 'shot', 'Ford', 'logo', 'scenes', 'are', 'unnecessary', 'actually', 'serve', 'put', 'big', 'brake', 'flow', 'So', 'much', 'time', 'was', 'tempted', 'turn', 'off', 'show.', 'are', 'few', 'nice', 'special', 'features', 'end', 'series', 'watching', 'little', 'video', 'montage', 'Laurie', 'quite', 'fun']",House: Season Eight

Two, the interaction between House and Wilson has always been a big highlight of the show, to me. Lastly, I will miss Hugh Laurie.

I think Dr. Foreman moving to Dean of Medicine was a good move and places that role more in perspective.Having viewed the entire season 8, I enjoyed all except for the ending where Dr. House seems to ""throw in the towel"" when he usually would have found a way out, avoiding as much pain as possible, and still continue his struggle for truth and something greater than himself and his own interests.

I have seen him pop up in things for years and have always been entertained.Likewise I have been a fan of House since the Pilot. I own the first seven seasons on DVD and watch them off and on even still.Having said that I did not enjoy the slow death of House which is what Season eight seemed to be.The final shot of Season seven, on the beach (is that a spoiler?) was, to my mind a perfect ending to this show. it is in the way I see the character. How Dr. House would have exited.From the beginning of Season eight I was personally not entertained much. there were sections here and there but overall the shows seemed more stand alone than any other season.I felt the writing was poorer, like the writers either were new and didnt understand the core of the characters or just had no direction.None of the characters seemed to be themselves. The prison shows being the worst, but in general House being a caricature of House rather than the character I had grown to know. I seriously missed Olivia Wilde. Her character had become so three dimensional in the preceding seasons.However, one caveat to that is the character of Chase. His personal arc thru this season was surprisingly deep. He seemed to mature as a person. And it seriously only just struck me now as i type this.Of the others; Foreman, Taub, and Wilson seemed wooden, like furniture on the set.

TREAD EXTREMELY CAREFULLY IF YOU NEVER SAW A COMMERCIAL, READ AN ARTICLE OR SAW ANY PRESS ABOUT THE FINAL SEASON OF THIS PROGRAM. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION. YOU MAY RETURN TO READING.The formula to this show started to wear extremely thin in the seventh season, but they energized it with the romance between House and Cuddy. The bravura episode when Cuddy was potentially dying (because everyone close to House HAS to be near-death at one point so that he can help them) that Hugh Laurie himself directed was probably the best episode this show's ever had. Sadly, just a few episodes later, he crashed his car through Cuddy's dining room and started this season in prison. Honestly, this whole final season would have been much more daring and interesting if House had to stay in prison.Alas, Fox didn't think that was too good of an idea because, if time teaches anything in regards to television, you HAVE to stay formulaic and predictable.Aside from the addition of Odette Annable and Charlene Yi as the beautiful wealthy-but-feels-bad-about-it and quirky-yet-plain-jane doctors respectively, there is literally no new ground to cover. The team gets an unusual case that somehow ends up playing as a metaphorical subplot to the episode; House plays mind games with the team; the cure is magically discovered with 6 minutes left in the episode.However, the show still remains somewhat interesting because the ensemble plays it well. Hugh Laurie, though, is starting to look tired of this character and that sometimes comes across.The best but possibly also the worst thing about this final season is the friendship between House and Wilson. Robert Sean Leonard always works, but they might have gone too far this time. Near the end of the season, it's discovered that Wilson has cancer. The next couple of episodes deal with that news and a possible cure. This brings them closer, but will Wilson survive?This is the kind of hack plotting that I would expect from ER or GREY'S ANATOMY, but the Ratings Gods demand that you CANNOT FOOL WITH FORMULA. It worked for big ratings for those shows. Why not here, especially since this season had its lowest ratings yet?That should tell Fox something: You can't beat a dead horse (or House... UCWIDT?), so you should start running something with more life. Not that they should have just axed the show, but they could have really played with this season and made it interesting and compelling instead of trite, rote, and dull.It's also a conundrum when you've got a series finale where the one person in the world who House cares about is perhaps dying or dead.

Yes, we can't resist Sherlock Holmes in any guise, nor Hugh Laurie.  House was one of our favorite thing to watch and watch again. Season 7 ended with the shark-jumping scene of House deliberately driving his car into Lisa Cuddy's living room. At that point, I was done, plus my House-watching partner checked out from a medical mystery of his own and I couldn't bear to watch it any more. Recently, after seeing a few old episodes on cable, I decided I needed to order this and watch the rest of the series.I was pleasantly surprised. The first episode, which takes place a year after the house-crashing incident, is set entirely in prison, where House is cooling his heels in a self-imposed punishment (his lawyer failed to get a reduced sentence--because as the old saying goes, any lawyer who represents himself has a fool for a client, and that must apply to doctors who decide they can play lawyer as well. House represented himself.) The prison scenes, the interaction of the gangs, the ""exit tax"" and the drug culture are well played. Yes, it's fiction and I'm sure only bears a slight resemblence to reality, but it had a gritty, nasty feel and I enjoyed it.The rest of the episodes have House back on duty as a doctor, and it's a bit like watching someone revived from the dead. Zombie-House is just as much if not more of an arse, and how he reassembles his team is frankly illegal but that's nothing new. Wilson is also quite a bit zombie-like. Some of the fire and purpose seem gone, but that becomes apparent later in the season. However, I felt he was telegraphing the tragedy-to-come. (No Spoilers.) If you put your credulity on hold (because you pretty  much have to) the drama is good and the filming and music and acting are at their professional best. If it's a bit unreal, well, we're used to that. The end has a few holes and gets almost unbelievable, but it's a fitting end and leaves you wanting just a bit more back-story, or what-happens-next, which is a mark of a great series finale. Done, wrapped up, but couldn't there be just a bit more?One thing I really liked about the Blu-Ray disks I bought: I had the option to ""load"" them in the Cloud via Universal, Ultraviolet and Vudu (how these all work together is a bit Byzantine.) Essentially, by registering the purchase online with a code included in the box, I was able to watch them in HD on the Roku rather than swap disks in and out. Pretty cool.

In the season premiere, ""Twenty Vicodin,"" Dr. Jessica Adams (Odette Annable) is a bit wary at times, but despite the reasons for House's being there, Adams quickly deduces that this man is a medical genius from whom there's lots to learn.After much wangling on the part of House's former team member Dr. Eric Foreman (Omar Epps) - who is now the Dean of Medicine, taking over for Cuddy - House is able to work at the hospital again. The only problem is, he no longer has a team - during the past year, everyone scattered to other parts of the hospital. Foreman also refuses to give House a departmental budget. But of course, being House, neither is much of an obstacle for him. He lures Adams away from her prison job to come work for him for free (for the time being), and also acquires Dr. Chi Park (Charlyn Yi), a hesitant young Asian woman who seems to have lost favor in her old department due to a surprising act, and now needs to find another position ASAP.After a time, House also persuades his old team members Dr. Chris Taub (Peter Jacobson) and Dr. Robert Chase (Jesse Spencer) to return.Karolina Wydra also returns as House's green card wife Dominika, the two forging something like a real relationship as they get caught by immigration officials and must live together to convince everyone of their sincerity.After several seasons where Chase was almost part of the background, it was refreshing to see the charismatic Australian land a few meatier stories throughout the season, including a strange but intense relationship with an ailing young nun, and a patient who attacks him with a knife and nearly kills him, causing serious physical damage and some emotional, as the experience forces Chase to really think about his life.But in the end, House's entire existence always boils down to one thing -- his longtime best friend Dr. James Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard). Throughout all of House's madness, the long-suffering Wilson has been the voice of reason, and on occasion, his partner in crime. No matter who else comes or goes in House's life, he can always count on Wilson to be the one solid and consistent. Yet a shocking development suddenly rears its ugly head in the final episodes, and House is forced to confront the possibility that he may indeed be alone in the end. Can House possibly survive? Or, the bigger question seems to be, would House even WANT to?While viewers have voiced all sorts of opinions and speculations about this final season, and largely the very end depicting House's future, one thing is certain -- this show is one that won't be forgotten any time soon.",4,A memorable exit for House & company,1339718400,"06 15, 2012",2012,3045,"['long-running', 'medical', 'drama', 'final', 'season', 'up', 'House', 'facing', 'consequences', 'Season', '7', 'destructive', 'act', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Dr.', 'Lisa', 'Cuddy', 'prison', 'where', 'learn', 'been', 'better', 'part', 'last', 'year.Although', 'House', 'no', 'longer', 'doctor', 'basic', 'nature', 'unable', 'stay', 'away', 'puzzles', 'especially', 'when', 'concern', 'medicine', 'meaning', 'House', 'frequent', 'visitor', 'prison', 'clinic', 'season', 'premiere', 'Twenty', 'Vicodin', 'Dr.', 'Jessica', 'Adams', 'Odette', 'Annable', 'bit', 'wary', 'times', 'reasons', 'House', 'being', 'there', 'Adams', 'quickly', 'man', 'medical', 'genius', 'whom', 'lots', 'learn.After', 'much', 'wangling', 'part', 'House', 'former', 'team', 'member', 'Dr.', 'Eric', 'Foreman', 'Omar', 'Epps', 'who', 'now', 'Dean', 'Medicine', 'taking', 'over', 'Cuddy', 'House', 'able', 'work', 'hospital', 'again', 'only', 'problem', 'no', 'longer', 'team', 'past', 'year', 'everyone', 'scattered', 'other', 'parts', 'hospital', 'Foreman', 'also', 'give', 'House', 'departmental', 'budget', 'course', 'being', 'House', 'much', 'obstacle', 'Adams', 'away', 'prison', 'job', 'come', 'work', 'free', 'time', 'being', 'also', 'Dr.', 'Chi', 'Park', 'Charlyn', 'Yi', 'hesitant', 'young', 'Asian', 'woman', 'who', 'have', 'lost', 'favor', 'old', 'department', 'due', 'surprising', 'act', 'now', 'find', 'position', 'ASAP.After', 'time', 'House', 'also', 'old', 'team', 'members', 'Dr.', 'Chris', 'Taub', 'Peter', 'Jacobson', 'Dr.', 'Robert', 'Chase', 'Jesse', 'Spencer', 'return.Karolina', 'Wydra', 'also', 'House', 'green', 'card', 'wife', 'Dominika', 'two', 'forging', 'something', 'real', 'relationship', 'get', 'caught', 'immigration', 'officials', 'must', 'live', 'together', 'convince', 'everyone', 'sincerity.After', 'several', 'seasons', 'where', 'Chase', 'was', 'almost', 'part', 'background', 'was', 'refreshing', 'see', 'charismatic', 'Australian', 'land', 'few', 'meatier', 'stories', 'season', 'including', 'strange', 'intense', 'relationship', 'ailing', 'young', 'nun', 'patient', 'who', 'knife', 'nearly', 'kills', 'causing', 'serious', 'physical', 'damage', 'emotional', 'experience', 'forces', 'Chase', 'really', 'think', 'life.But', 'end', 'House', 'entire', 'existence', 'always', 'down', 'one', 'thing', 'longtime', 'best', 'friend', 'Dr.', 'James', 'Wilson', 'Robert', 'Sean', 'Leonard', 'House', 'madness', 'long-suffering', 'Wilson', 'been', 'voice', 'reason', 'occasion', 'partner', 'crime', 'No', 'matter', 'who', 'else', 'House', 'life', 'can', 'always', 'count', 'Wilson', 'be', 'one', 'solid', 'consistent', 'shocking', 'development', 'suddenly', 'ugly', 'head', 'final', 'episodes', 'House', 'forced', 'confront', 'possibility', 'may', 'indeed', 'be', 'alone', 'end', 'Can', 'House', 'possibly', 'survive', 'bigger', 'question', 'be', 'would', 'House', 'even', 'WANT', 'viewers', 'have', 'voiced', 'sorts', 'opinions', 'speculations', 'final', 'season', 'largely', 'very', 'end', 'depicting', 'House', 'future', 'one', 'thing', 'certain', 'show', 'one', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'forgotten', 'time', 'soon']",House: Season Eight

I never cared very much whether the medicine or medical procedures were accurate. I'm not a doctor of any kind so even some glaring mistakes probably flew by me unnoticed. I usually didn't care overly much about the guest patients or their illnesses, either, although there were a few I liked. I also liked only 2 or 3 of the diagnostic team members enough to be interested in their own separate stories, but more often than not I resented the times when a supporting character was featured because more of ""them"" usually meant less of Hugh Laurie. And that's what it was always about for me: watching Hugh Laurie blow my mind week after week, year after year, playing THAT character. The only other actor/character icon I can think of that was as big and impressive was Alan Alda playing Hawkeye Pierce in the '70's. And frankly, I think Hugh is the better actor; Hugh was actually creating a character that was NOT like Hugh Laurie in any respect. Alan Alda as Hawkeye, by about the 3rd or 4th season of M*A*S*H, was basically playing himself under the name ""Hawkeye Pierce.""I will miss watching Hugh play House.

The other will delve into the final season of this amazing series.Spoiler-free:How do I sum up a show that has influenced me so greatly without giving anything away about the finale, or the episodes that lead up to it? I think the answer lies in House as a character. I have to assume if you are reading the review for the final season of a show that has had eight, that you are at least somewhat familiar with it. I am going to assume that because there is no way to talk about the character as a whole without going over the past seasons. I will not spoil eight at all, but I will talk about seven in this review, and how it ties into eight beautifully.So, here we go. House is as damaged as a character comes. He has tried to find love, with Stacy in season two, and Cuddy in season seven. Some can argue there was even something between he and Cameron in the first season. House is capable of love. He loves more than most do, but in a way that is guarded behind cynicism, sarcasm, and avoidance. He sabotages every relationship. Cuddy made his fears come to life in ""Bombshells"", the season seven episode. It ultimately leads to what many call the ""jump the shark moment"". House drives his car through her living room. To me it was brilliant, and completely in character.What the season seven finale left were a lot of questions. Many felt like the House they had watched over the years would never have done something so destructive. Season eight had to be about redemption. And my fellow fans, the writers hit it out of the park. He paid the price for the crash. Due to a negotiation fall out Lisa Edelstein's final scene in the show was last season, after House gives her the hair brush back. And, in my opinion, it was the perfect exit for her character. But, that doesn't change the fact that the act of last season made many find House's character had gone too far.Season eight is all about new beginnings, but at the same time falling back into old habits. The first episode is about paying the price for crashing his car into her home. The episodes that follow slowly peel back layers of House we haven't gotten to see before. His redemption comes in paying high prices. The final four episodes of this season are some of the best of the series. The final arc is the one that really challenges House. It makes him show love in a way we knew he was capable, but haven't seen before. To me Wilson has always been the left foot to House's right. So many people talk about Cuddy as House's love. Whatever place she did have, she gave up when she toyed with him. Wilson has always been House's deepest love. They have a friendship that has survived betrayal, (Wilson in season three's, ""Merry Little Christmas"") death, (Amber in the season four finale ""Wilson's Heart"") and House's countless acts of self destruction. For House, his love is not Stacy, Cameron, or Cuddy. His love is Wilson: A friend that has been there through the worst of it all and hasn't abandoned him. It is completely fitting and fantastic that the last four episodes focus on House and Wilson. And the finale is one of ultimate sacrifice. It is House's redemption, and ends this series in the best way possible.Spoiler review:This is for those who have watched the whole final season, the finale and all.Let's begin. The price House pays for the car crash is a year of prison. The episode does a wonderful job of setting the stage for what the final season will be. He has paid his price, and now is released under Foreman's watch on parole. House's office has been shut down, and turned into a whole other ward. Foreman is now dean. Two new doctors join his team. Throughout the season, House slowly earns his office back. His team is Chase, Taub, Park, and Adams. It's about rebuilding. Season eight has a first season feel, and I love it. I feel like we now know what Wilson talks about in the first season: House pining over Stacy for five years; us meeting him as he starts to pick himself back up again. Wilson talks about how he was there when House got really bad. I feel like the seven seasons were us watching him slowly get back to that dark dark place that Wilson talks about in the first season. And so it is very fitting that the final season is about him starting over again. We have come full circle, and season eight is the only place House could have ended. Because, this time, he changes himself.The final arc was beyond brilliant. It was heartbreaking in its irony and eye opening on so many levels. Wilson has cancer. Not like Cuddy last season where it was a close call. He has a stage 2 thymoma that has invaded the tissue around his thymus. There's a seventy five percent chance of beating it, which also means there's a twenty five percent chance of not. The final four episodes are about House and Wilson. The arc starts with a radical treatment that doesn't work, until it soon becomes about accepting the final five months House has with his best friend. In the penultimate episode ""Holding On"", a small prank from House becomes his downfall. As he has begun to accept that he has five months left with Wilson, the small prank comes back to bite him. He has to go back to jail for six months; Wilson only has five to live. I entered the series finale feeling a sense of dread. After all, its titled ""Everybody Dies"", and there is absolute truth in it. But, the finale was the most fitting one I can dream up. Kutner, Amber, Stacy, and Cameron all came back as different parts of his subconscious, convincing him that there was more to him than the medicine, or his friendship with Wilson. Convincing him that he'll be okay even when his friend is gone. It was incredible. I used to think the only way for House to end would be for him to die. And he did, but not the man, the identity of House. He faked his own death, destroying any chance of practicing medicine again, just so he can spend Wilson's last five months with him.You wanted redemption. There it is. And in a scene I never thought I would see, House and Wilson ride off on motorcycles, starting their last five months together. It's as happy of an ending that a show like House can have. In his own way, House did get to ride off into the sunset. Amazing. Inspired. Incredible. There will never be another show like House.",5,An incredible final season for an incredible show.,1337644800,"05 22, 2012",2012,6354,"['am', 'going', 'write', 'two', 'reviews', 'One', 'will', 'be',

1438695,AYZV1PJP6NXPT,B0053O89JM,"R. Long ""JaminRebel""","[0, 7]","I don't have a racial axe to bear but I did think I might point out that the writers of House Season 8 left Omar Epps/Dr. Eric Foreman in charge. When all was lost and after the series-- the writing and the stories--- had gone into the crapper, then a black man was left in a position of authority. I'm not bothered by this and I don't think it was planned but if I was a black person looking for a chance to gripe then I might have noticed this. By season 8, oh hell, let the black guy be the head honcho. The show was by then scheduled for cancellation. Lisa Edelstein/Dr. Cuddy the old boss of Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital (PPTH) in New Jersey, was gone. In fact Edelstein's character was so far gone to where she wouldn't even make a cameo in season 8. If I was a critic I might think that Edelstein  didn't want to be associated further with a show which had become a joke and if not a joke but a caricature or a shadow of itself. Season 8 had no future, it was all about the exit plan.Season 8 is marred with so many episodes of some patient spitting up blood. And then there was the paralysis of what seemed like every other patient. Then there were the mindless and pointless head games that House played with himself and with his staff of doctors. Greg House just came off as some sort of crank, some sort of nutjob who was constantly acting like a nutjob because he could, because he was a brilliant doctor. And because Greg House was a brilliant doctor the hospital was going to bend over and give the man everything that he wanted like a wall that lifted up so he could see his buddy Dr. James Wilson/Robert Sean Leonard. And because House was brilliant the hospital tolerated it when he shot at his doctors with a paint gun, a squirt gun, when he tossed soda balloons, when he stole an expensive medical machine. The hospital also tolerated his war with the prosthetics department, and as House interviewed prostitutes. The prostitute idea and theme was in bad taste in other seasons but was over developed and overdone to adnauseum  last season. But once again people who tolerated Greg House had to sit through more of this. But in season 8 House just went nuts as he tried to strangle a patient which became just another behavior that one must tolerate when in the company of a brilliant doctor.In this last season the writers saw the exit of Dr. Pretty Boy Chase played by Jesse Spencer. I was glad to see Dr. Pretty Boy leave because as a mediocre boy I get my fill of these perfect sexy guys that get all the girls in real life and on tv. Of interest this season was Charlyne Yi, who played the Asian Dr. Park. I at least found her to be entertaining even though she didn't have a future on the show. And finally for Season 8 Dr. James Wilson developed cancer and after failing chemo therapy was left with about 5 months to live. Greg House goes out and takes heroin with a patient. He wakes up in a burning building, which is on fire and he has visits of dead or previous doctors from the hospital. Greg House supposedly dies in the burning building. But, SURPRISE, the burned dead body was not Greg House but it was his patient. Apparently all you have to do is to switch dental charts of a person and you have successfully faked your own death.So it is in this unbelievable scenario that Greg House takes off and onto the road with James Wilson via motorcycles.My problem is the ending was a joke and it just couldn't hold up to any scrutiny. And long gone was most any respect that many of us had for the character of Greg House. Greg House showed himself to be a selfish, egocentric JERK. And I think it was sad and rather telling that James Wilson rode off into the sunset with House the idiot. Really, was House any kind of a friend and if so did James Wilson really respect him and if so why?A lot of us in the real world have problems but we don't start going to prostitutes, drugs, alcohol, etc. Many of us are also smart but we don't ruin the lives of everyone around us just because we are so brilliant. I'm sure a lot of brilliant men and women brought a lot of people into their lives of pain but never perhaps in the history of television was their ever such an indulged and self absorbed character who had so many people bending over and bowing down to his eccentric behavior. Greg House might as well have been King Greg House. I mean this character was allowed to do just about anything that he wanted. Thus the stories just became more and more RIDICULOUS over time.I used to respect the show but now I'm just glad that it is off of the air. And Season 8 was as others called it, A MISTAKE.Lisa Edelstein, kudos to you and your character for not coming back in season 8, the worst season of House.",3,Writers left the BLACK MAN in charge of

Cuddy is out the picture now and Foreman is in charge of the hospital. We see the return some of our old favorites and introduce a couple new people to the team. Without giving much away, I will say the last few episodes are incredible and debunks the assumption that House is selfish and only cares about himself as you will see with the extreme sacrifices he will make to be able spend time with and help Wilson.
