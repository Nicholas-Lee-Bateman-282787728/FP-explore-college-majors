321839,AQLDURX81AGIA,630259331X,"H. L. Cripe ""cooncat3""","[20, 20]","One needs several rating scales to do this video justice. If I were rating it solely on Allan Jones' voice and performance, I'd give it a 5+. Jeannette MacDonald gets a 4 - she probably rates higher but the technology of the time made most women's voices sound shrill and squeaky. As an excellent example of the musical genre of 1930s-1950s operettas it definitely gets a 5. The overall performance gets a 4, and in judging it, one must again do so in the context of the time period in which it was filmed.All ratings aside, one must admit that most operettas of the years mentioned were pretty superficial in plot, with the standard fearless hero, dimwit heroine, and sneering villian -- who usually had the best part and was the only real actor in the cast. ""Firefly"" gives us a treat in that our heroine Jeannette is far more spunky and sparky than most of her ilk - she's a Spanish spy helping thwart the French invasion of Spain during the Napoleonic wars. Allan Jones is the French agent sent to trap her. After a series of encounters, betrayals, battles and general dashing about, comes the happy ending - this is, after all, an operetta.The filming and special effects are again typical of the period, and thus must be considered as good as the technology was capable of producing. It's obvious to us today that most of the time Allan Jones was singing ""The Donkey Serenade"" he wasn't really riding a horse but for that time period the special effects people faked it pretty well.I can't say enough for the music in this film - Rudoph Friml's score is absolutely gorgeous, and further enhanced by the singers and the sumptious orchestal background. If you really like good music performed by equally good musicians, you can't go wrong with this film. Ignore the historical inaccuracies, goofy plot, somewhat hammy performances, and inept effects - just relax, put your feet up, pet the cat, let yourself sink into that glorious music, and enjoy.",4,From an Admitted Allan Jones Nut,1128470400,"10 5, 2005",2005,1953,"['One', 'several', 'rating', 'scales', 'do', 'video', 'justice', 'were', 'rating', 'solely', 'Allan', 'Jones', 'voice', 'performance', ""'d"", 'give', '5+', 'Jeannette', 'MacDonald', '4', 'probably', 'rates', 'higher', 'technology', 'time', 'made', 'most', 'women', 'voices', 'sound', 'shrill', 'squeaky', 'excellent', 'example', 'musical', 'genre', '1930s-1950s', 'operettas', 'definitely', '5', 'overall', 'performance', '4', 'judging', 'must', 'again', 'do', 'so', 'context', 'time', 'period', 'was', 'filmed.All', 'ratings', 'aside', 'must', 'admit', 'most', 'operettas', 'years', 'mentioned', 'were', 'pretty', 'superficial', 'plot', 'standard', 'fearless', 'hero', 'dimwit', 'heroine', 'sneering', 'villian', 'who', 'usually', 'had', 'best', 'part', 'was', 'only', 'real', 'actor', 'cast', 'Firefly', 'treat', 'heroine', 'Jeannette', 'far', 'more', 'spunky', 'sparky', 'most', 'ilk', 'Spanish', 'spy', 'helping', 'thwart', 'French', 'invasion', 'Spain', 'Napoleonic', 'wars', 'Allan', 'Jones', 'French', 'agent', 'sent', 'trap', 'series', 'encounters', 'betrayals', 'battles', 'general', 'dashing', 'happy', 'ending', 'operetta.The', 'filming', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'again', 'typical', 'period', 'thus', 'must', 'be', 'considered', 'as', 'good', 'technology', 'was', 'capable', 'producing', 'obvious', 'today', 'most', 'time', 'Allan', 'Jones', 'was', 'singing', 'Donkey', 'Serenade', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'riding', 'horse', 'time', 'period', 'special', 'effects', 'people', 'faked', 'pretty', 'well.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'music', 'film', 'Rudoph', 'Friml', 'score', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'further', 'enhanced', 'singers', 'sumptious', 'orchestal', 'background', 'really', 'good', 'music', 'performed', 'equally', 'good', 'musicians', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'film', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'goofy', 'plot', 'somewhat', 'hammy', 'performances', 'inept', 'effects', 'just', 'relax', 'put', 'feet', 'up', 'cat', 'let', 'sink', 'glorious', 'music', 'enjoy']",The Firefly VHS

Now, with the same technique, I've come across some really good movies, like &quot;Cleopatra&quot; and &quot;Employees Entrance&quot;, but &quot;The Firefly&quot; ain't one of them. And it isn't because it's an operetta--I liked &quot;Rosemarie&quot; and &quot;Maytime&quot;. No, it's because it's boring and extremely unbelieveable. Eventually, I grew impatient waiting for Warren William to appear, and put the film on Fast Forward. Even then, time passed slowly. In addition, I had heard the name, &quot;Donkey Serenade&quot; before, but I found that song to be something of a loser too.

But what is said tooseldom is that this is one of MacDonald's best roles, with lots of singing of her specialkind and even some dancing. (She also plays the piano, and supposedly did herown playing, though, given the mechanics of film production, this seems unlikely. Itwould have been easier to let her mime to any old pianist's pre-recording.)Allan Jones is fun, too, and he gets the film's best known number,""The Donkey Serenade,"" which was arranged from a Friml piece called ""Chansonette."" All theother main numbers come from Friml's stage Firefly, except for ""He Who Loves and RunsAway,"" which is supposedly by Friml, though, judging from a little bit of research,it would appear that no one really knows its source. The craziestthing about this film is that the story hasn't even a shred of a relationship with thatof the stage show. That was a modern-dress piece about a street singer who becomes afamous diva. MacDonald's Firefly is a spy drama, set during Napoleon's invasion ofSpain.In short: it's neither a wonderful nor a terrible film in its contents, but MacDonaldfans will really enjoy it.

321843,A13M2TSVMDTBC8,630259331X,Ol'BlueEyes,"[0, 1]","There isn't much to say about this film. Its main reason for existing is the star power of Jeanette MacDonald and Alan Jones. Judging from the reviews, Jones fans and MacDonald fans were mainly attracted by the presence of their star and didn't know all that much about the other star. The plot sounds like it could have some meat to it -- MacDonald as a Spanish spy among French and Jones as the French counterspy sent to find and trap her -- but there is no real suspense. The relationship between Jones and MacDonald develops in the usual manner with Jeanette at first scornful towards her unwanted suitor, but gradually warming up as she falls for his charm.Of course the reason to see the film is for the musical performances. Coming from the MacDonald camp, Alan Jones was just pleasant. He sang his songs in a pleasing way, but not so I would have suspected him of being a considerable star.Jeanette MacDonald had top billing and really dominated the film with her very lively singing and dancing.
