Compared to Plastic Little, every other anime looks like Scooby Doo.Remember the scene from Raiders  of the Lost Ark where Jones is about to face a giant with a sword, then  rather than fight him, Jones just pulls out a gun and shoots him?  That  unconventional not-what-you-expect touch made the move unique.  A lot of  the fights in Plastic Little are like that.  That's why some people here  are upset because rather than another set of big super-fights, the  heroes/villains use guile and end it quickly.  It's unconventional, but  after seeing dozens of other animes, it's nice.If you're not familiar  with anime yet, I would suggest you pass this one up and get Tenchi Muyo,  Birdy the Mighty, or Ah! My Goddess!  The plot is much easier to follow in  those animes.  If you've seen a lot of anime, and are looking for something  new, Plastic Little may be what you're looking for.",3,"Not Perfect, but OK",955584000,"04 13, 2000",2000,1005,"['Not', 'perfect', 'certainly', 'not', 'one-star', 'anime', 'animation', 'simply', 'amazing', 'Rent', 'nothing', 'else', 'Compared', 'Plastic', 'Little', 'other', 'anime', 'looks', 'Scooby', 'Doo.Remember', 'scene', 'Raiders', 'Lost', 'Ark', 'where', 'Jones', 'face', 'giant', 'sword', 'then', 'rather', 'fight', 'Jones', 'just', 'out', 'gun', 'shoots', 'unconventional', 'not-what-you-expect', 'touch', 'made', 'move', 'unique', 'lot', 'fights', 'Plastic', 'Little', 'are', 'why', 'people', 'here', 'are', 'upset', 'rather', 'set', 'big', 'super-fights', 'heroes/villains', 'use', 'guile', 'end', 'quickly', 'unconventional', 'seeing', 'dozens', 'other', 'animes', 'nice.If', ""'re"", 'not', 'familiar', 'anime', 'yet', 'would', 'suggest', 'pass', 'one', 'up', 'get', 'Tenchi', 'Muyo', 'Birdy', 'Mighty', 'Ah', 'Goddess', 'plot', 'much', 'easier', 'follow', 'animes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'anime', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'new', 'Plastic', 'Little', 'may', 'be', 'what', ""'re"", 'looking']",N/A
800779,A26O0T192IBKY1,B0001DCXSI,J. Alford,"[1, 1]","Satoshi Urushima is best known for his work on such anime productions as Record Of Lodoss War and Bubblegum Crisis, or his designs for the Langrisser and Growlanser video games. However, a few of his own creations like Legend Of Lemnear have been adapted into anime as well. One is the oddly-titled Plastic Little, a one-shot OVA that was not originally a manga but the basis for its own action/sci-fi anime.Set on a colonized alien world in the future, Tita is the spunky teenage captain of an airship/submarine called the Cha-Cha Maru whose crew seeks out exotic creatures. This trade is referred to as ""petshop hunters"", although it makes you think that they track down strip malls. Tita saves Elysse, the daughter of a brilliant scientist while she is on the run from the corrupt military. The highly-helmeted commander, Lord Guizel, plans to use Elysse's knowledge of a gyro system which sustains their nation's capitol in the air so he can take over the government. Tita takes Elysse back to the Cha-Cha Maru where she introduces her to the rest of her crew(who have some of the most stereotypical European accents ever!). Guizel eventually works out how to operate the gyro system, and its up to Tita to storm the complex and stop him. After making short work of the stormtroopers, Tita copies the ending to Return Of The Jedi by sending Guizel down an energy shaft. She then pulls out a Capt. Kirk-like deus-ex machina by exploding a typhoon to take out the rest of the evil fleet. Elysse leaves to help repair the damage caused by Guizel, which pretty much caused the entire city to be destroyed.The OVA makes for a good story, although there was some pretty blatant boob-shots thrown into it, so much so that for its DVD release, ADV Films implemented their patented ""jiggle-counter"" with it. It features some impressive animation and character designs, plus the ending undersea battle is a real eyegasm. This is one of those anime titles that was a standard to own in the 90s, and I'd mainly recommend it to anyone from the era of gratuitous fan service!",3,Fan Service A-Hoy!,1307232000,"06 5, 2011",2011,2065,"['Satoshi', 'Urushima', 'best', 'known', 'work', 'such', 'anime', 'productions', 'Record', 'Lodoss', 'War', 'Bubblegum', 'Crisis', 'designs', 'Langrisser', 'Growlanser', 'video', 'games', 'However', 'few', 'own', 'creations', 'Legend', 'Lemnear', 'have', 'been', 'adapted', 'anime', 'as', 'well', 'One', 'oddly-titled', 'Plastic', 'Little', 'one-shot', 'OVA', 'was', 'not', 'originally', 'manga', 'basis', 'own', 'action/sci-fi', 'anime.Set', 'colonized', 'alien', 'world', 'future', 'Tita', 'spunky', 'teenage', 'captain', 'airship/submarine', 'called', 'Cha-Cha', 'Maru', 'crew', 'out', 'exotic', 'creatures', 'trade', 'referred', 'petshop', 'hunters', 'think', 'track', 'down', 'strip', 'malls', 'Tita', 'Elysse', 'daughter', 'brilliant', 'scientist', 'run', 'corrupt', 'military', 'highly-helmeted', 'commander', 'Lord', 'Guizel', 'use', 'Elysse', 'knowledge', 'gyro', 'system', 'nation', 'capitol', 'air', 'can', 'take', 'government', 'Tita', 'Elysse', 'back', 'Cha-Cha', 'Maru', 'where', 'rest', 'crew', 'who', 'have', 'most', 'stereotypical', 'European', 'accents', 'ever', 'Guizel', 'eventually', 'out', 'how', 'operate', 'gyro', 'system', 'up', 'Tita', 'storm', 'complex', 'stop', 'making', 'short', 'work', 'stormtroopers', 'Tita', 'ending', 'Return', 'Jedi', 'sending', 'Guizel', 'down', 'energy', 'shaft', 'then', 'out', 'Capt', 'Kirk-like', 'deus-ex', 'machina', 'exploding', 'typhoon', 'take', 'out', 'rest', 'evil', 'fleet', 'Elysse', 'help', 'repair', 'damage', 'caused', 'Guizel', 'pretty', 'much', 'caused', 'entire', 'city', 'be', 'destroyed.The', 'OVA', 'good', 'story', 'was', 'pretty', 'blatant', 'boob-shots', 'thrown', 'so', 'much', 'DVD', 'release', 'ADV', 'Films', 'implemented', 'patented', 'jiggle-counter', 'impressive', 'animation', 'character', 'designs', 'ending', 'undersea', 'battle', 'real', 'eyegasm', 'one', 'anime', 'titles', 'was', 'standard', 'own', '90s', ""'d"", 'mainly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'era', 'gratuitous', 'fan', 'service']",N/A

So they decided to name little Tina their captain. Practice made perfect, and little Tina grew up to become a quite capable captain indeed. She also grew up in other ways: she is now 17, and crewmen worry she might someday fall for some outsider hunk... Better keep things in the family. Young pilot Nichols is handsome and well-behaved (does that make him effeminate? I think not) and he adores Tina as his little sister. Would he consider updating his feelings? suggests an older mate. As Nichols protests that Tina is still too young and innocent, the mate takes him to Tina's bathroom porthole, and the young man gets the nosebleed of his life. Tina notices him and is furious.Later on, severely wounded Tina wakes up in a hospital bed (and""barely"" covered) and finds Nichols asleep at her feet.  ""Not again!"" she groans - but then realizes that the poor boy is exhausted from waiting on her. Instead of slapping him, she gives him a quick peck on the cheek.Things do not go any further in this episode, and I wish there were more, just to see how gentle Nichols will eventually capture the (nicely-wrapped) heart of his beloved Captain.",4,ai ai Captain,1222041600,"09 22, 2008",2008,1373,"['addition', 'what', 'well-known', 'PL', 'have', 'own', 'sweet', 'teen', 'romance', 'la', 'Nadia-', '-Jean.Batten', 'down', 'mateys', 'Spoilers', 'ahead', 'When', 'Tina', 'father', 'died', 'heroically', 'hinted', 'none', 'crew', 'felt', 'worthy', 'succeed', 'decided', 'name', 'little', 'Tina', 'captain', 'Practice', 'made', 'perfect', 'little', 'Tina', 'grew', 'up', 'become', 'quite', 'capable', 'captain', 'indeed', 'also', 'grew', 'up', 'other', 'ways', 'now', '17', 'crewmen', 'worry', 'might', 'someday', 'fall', 'outsider', 'hunk', 'Better', 'keep', 'things', 'family', 'Young', 'pilot', 'Nichols', 'handsome', 'well-behaved', 'make', 'effeminate', 'think', 'not', 'Tina', 'little', 'sister', 'Would', 'consider', 'updating', 'feelings', 'older', 'mate', 'Nichols', 'Tina', 'still', 'too', 'young', 'innocent', 'mate', 'Tina', 'bathroom', 'porthole', 'young', 'man', 'nosebleed', 'life', 'Tina', 'furious.Later', 'severely', 'wounded', 'Tina', 'up', 'hospital', 'bed', 'barely', 'covered', 'Nichols', 'asleep', 'feet', 'Not', 'again', 'then', 'poor', 'boy', 'exhausted', 'waiting', 'Instead', 'slapping', 'quick', 'peck', 'cheek.Things', 'do', 'not', 'go', 'further', 'episode', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'just', 'see', 'how', 'gentle', 'Nichols', 'will', 'eventually', 'capture', 'nicely-wrapped', 'heart', 'beloved', 'Captain']",N/A
800782,A13QYVLBUSN1YA,B0001DCXSI,"Tristan MacAvery ""Author/Actor/Director""","[5, 5]","(Discussions of plot, fan-service, etc., are much better covered in other reviews. This review is exclusively to mention some behind-the-scenes information about the dubbing of this feature, from one of the voice actors in the show.)I provided the English-dubbed voice for the engineer, Mikhail. Or was he the engineer? It's been so long since I've seen this thing (and I recorded it in 1997 or so), I can't really remember much about it -- which, I suppose, says something of the overall plot.My use of a Russian accent was planned well; the execution of that accent wasn't planned well at all. I don't recall who decided that it should be that thick. In order for an accent to be believable and natural, it is often best to paint it on thinly rather than trying to go over the top. So my apologies right off the bat for that one -- I didn't do nearly as well as I could have done. My best contribution was to provide some actual Russian, such as ""Har' shoa"" (very good) and ""turok"" (stupid, or idiot -- much like the Japanese ""baka""). Please note the transliterated spelling of the Russian words is likely to be completely wrong; it's just how it sounds to my ear.The story overall was given as much seriousness as we could gather for it, perhaps realizing that it really is a ""fan service"" flick at best. We (the voice actors) gave it a helluva shot, and that's about the best I can say on our behalf. This isn't the same caliber as, say, ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" or ""Serial Experiments Lain"", so it really didn't get the same amount of attention or expertise from any of us. That, I confess, is a failing. The Tao would tell us, ""Pay as much attention to the end as to the beginning, and there will be no error.""",3,A Voice Actor Weighs In,1190419200,"09 22, 2007",2007,1717,"['Discussions', 'plot', 'fan-service', 'etc.', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'covered', 'other', 'reviews', 'review', 'exclusively', 'mention', 'behind-the-scenes', 'information', 'dubbing', 'feature', 'one', 'voice', 'actors', 'show', 'provided', 'English-dubbed', 'voice', 'engineer', 'Mikhail', 'was', 'engineer', 'been', 'so', 'long', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'thing', 'recorded', '1997', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'remember', 'much', 'suppose', 'something', 'overall', 'plot.My', 'use', 'Russian', 'accent', 'was', 'planned', 'well', 'execution', 'accent', 'was', ""n't"", 'planned', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'who', 'decided', 'should', 'be', 'thick', 'order', 'accent', 'be', 'believable', 'natural', 'often', 'best', 'paint', 'thinly', 'rather', 'trying', 'go', 'top', 'apologies', 'right', 'bat', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'nearly', 'as', 'well', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'best', 'contribution', 'was', 'provide', 'actual', 'Russian', 'such', 'Har', 'shoa', 'very', 'good', 'turok', 'stupid', 'idiot', 'much', 'Japanese', 'baka', 'Please', 'note', 'transliterated', 'spelling', 'Russian', 'words', 'likely', 'be', 'completely', 'wrong', 'just', 'how', 'ear.The', 'story', 'overall', 'was', 'given', 'much', 'seriousness', 'could', 'gather', 'perhaps', 'realizing', 'really', 'fan', 'service', 'flick', 'best', 'voice', 'actors', 'gave', 'helluva', 'shot', 'best', 'can', 'say', 'behalf', ""n't"", 'same', 'caliber', 'say', 'Neon', 'Genesis', 'Evangelion', 'Serial', 'Experiments', 'Lain', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'same', 'amount', 'attention', 'expertise', 'confess', 'failing', 'Tao', 'would', 'tell', 'Pay', 'as', 'much', 'attention', 'end', 'beginning', 'will', 'be', 'error']",N/A
