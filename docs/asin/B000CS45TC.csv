962065,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000CS45TC,A Customer,"[5, 7]","Meryl Streep, playing New York psychoanalyst Lisa Metzger in her latest movie, Prime, doesn't quite get what she wishes for, and she certainly doesn't practice what she preaches. During the course of the movie, she learns some hard lessons about life, mothering, and standards - and the fact that her patients' standards are remarkably different from the values she asks of David, her twenty-three-year-old son.Prime is a well-acted, astutely observed, and intelligently directed romantic comedy that is all about what happens, when your therapist discovers that you've been having a wild affair with her son. It's an absolute delight from beginning to end, not just because of the terrific lead performances from Streep, Thurman, and Greenberg, but also because director, Ben Younger seems perfectly adept at showing the perils and giddiness of romance from three very different vantage points.Rafi (Uma Thurman) is thirty-seven with an established career as a stylist and a luxurious Manhattan apartment. One night, at an Antonioni retrospective, she meets the hunky twenty-three year old David (Bryan Greenberg) after they are locked out of Blow Up. Rafi has just recently been divorced and has been having regular counseling sessions with Lisa (Streep). Rafi is only too happy to share as many cherished details as she can with Lisa, including graphic depictions of what the sex is like with the new young stud in her life.It doesn't take long for Lisa to wise up to the fact that Rafi is sleeping with her young son. As Rafi shares every intimate episode of her new affair, Lisa struggles to block out mental pictures she doesn't want to see and secrets she doesn't want to know. For Rafi, however, it's a chance to get back into life and rediscover a side of herself that she lost somewhere along the line during a mostly joyless 9-year-long marriage.For Dave, Rafi represents the older, more experienced woman and perhaps his first brush with serious love; and Lisa, forced to look on benignly, is miserably conflicted between seeing it as a breakthrough for her patient and a potentially devastating situation for Dave, whom Lisa doesn't believe is mature enough to handle the consequences. Lisa is torn between wanting to see her son happy, but also anxious for him to commit to a girl that shares his Jewish faith.The story gets most of its comic mileage from Lisa's squeamishness at hearing the intimate details of her son's sex life, which Streep plays marvelously well. In fact, the best moments in the film are when Rafi, high on the thrills of rediscovering sex, hashes out her feelings in Lisa's cozy little office. Even though Lisa realizes the new beau is David, she decides to put her client first, encouraging Rafi to luxuriate in her new lover.Streep is endearingly funny, uncomfortably shifting in her seat and tightening her stylish wrap around her, and profusely shaking with a glass of water in her hand, as Lisa is forced to listen to detailed descriptions of her son's private parts. But the actress also manages to show Lisa's vulnerability and a very real concern at seeing her precious son drifting away from her. She's an outsider, who becomes unwilling voyeur in this tempestuous affair between the younger man and the older woman.Both Thurman and Greenberg are absolutely terrific as the star crossed lovers, able to show vulnerability and sensitive as well as a passionate hunger for each other. Thurman is completely convincing as the kind of mature woman who could conceivably command attention from a man Dave's age. Greenberg - who is stunning to look at - turns Dave into a funny, sensitive guy who badly wants to be a part of Rafi's more sophisticated world, but isn't quite willing to give up his Nintendo marathons or his habit of hanging out and going to parties with his best mate.Although the plot becomes fairly formulaic, especially during the final third, the film raises some interesting issues about relationships and the kind of problems that couples realistically face in this type of situation. Much of the conflict between Rafi and Dave is caused by the fact that they just want different things out of life: Rafi, her biological clock ticking, is starting to think about motherhood, while Dave is far more concerned with surviving, finding a steady place to live, and pursuing his career as a painter.Although Prime is basically a romantic comedy - it's well stocked with smart one-liners and sharp observations, it's also remarkably sophisticated. Credit must without doubt go to Younger, who certainly doesn't sidestep the bitter and oftentimes sad truth about the age gap between people like Rafi and Dave.

962068,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000CS45TC,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","There's just something so inviting about a film starring the great Meryl Streep and the deliciously enticing Uma Thurman.  With that said, `Prime' delivers the goods, giving us a supremely funny while ultimately honest look at a relationship doomed from the very start.  It does play to some overseen clich&eacute;s from time to time, but for the most part `Prime' is true to itself and I must say that, to its credit, the ending was not predictable.  That's all I'll say about that; I don't want to spoil anything.`Prime' tells the story of middle-aged divorcee Rafi Gardet (I say middle-aged, but she's not quite there yet) who finds herself in a romantic relationship with a young painter named David Bloomberg; young as in 23 to her 37.  The relationship, while odd at first, grows nicely on the couple who genuinely appear to be falling in love with one another.  There's only one problem, and that problem is Rafi's therapist Lisa Metzger who just so happens to be David's mother.What makes `Prime' work so well is the chemistry between its stars.  We all know that Meryl and Uma are great actresses, but that doesn't always spell out success.  This time it does.  Both Uma and Meryl mesh so well together you never get a feeling of forced comedy between them.  They are enjoying themselves and thus we are enjoying them.  Even better though is the romantic chemistry between Thurman and Bryan Greenberg.  It's not hard to imagine falling for the beautiful Uma Thurman, but just because she's attractive doesn't mean you can fake the kind of intimacy needed to make this film work.  Thurman and Greenberg are so natural together, so believable tender and affectionate that you fall in love along with them.`Prime' may seem familiar in scenes; I'm not denying that there are streams of unoriginality here; but `Prime' handles things in a very mature way.  This is not the comedy I expected to see walking into it.  I really expected your run of the mill gag-filled romantic comedy but `Prime' offers the audience a sense of relatability that all too often goes missing in rom-coms today.In the end I highly recommend `Prime'.  It's funny, witty and sweet but most of all, it's sincere.  Thurman is breathtaking, Greenberg is charming and Streep is a scene stealing hoot.  This is truly a prime example of a movie giving its audience what they truly deserve.",4,"Honestly, this is prime entertainment...",1208908800,"04 23, 2008",2008,2362,"['just', 'something', 'so', 'inviting', 'film', 'starring', 'great', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'deliciously', 'enticing', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'said', 'Prime', 'goods', 'giving', 'supremely', 'funny', 'ultimately', 'honest', 'look', 'relationship', 'doomed', 'very', 'start', 'play', 'overseen', 'clich', 'eacute', 'time', 'time', 'most', 'part', 'Prime', 'true', 'must', 'say', 'credit', 'ending', 'was', 'not', 'predictable', ""'ll"", 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'anything.', 'Prime', 'story', 'middle-aged', 'divorcee', 'Rafi', 'Gardet', 'say', 'middle-aged', 'not', 'quite', 'there', 'yet', 'who', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'young', 'painter', 'named', 'David', 'Bloomberg', 'young', '23', '37', 'relationship', 'odd', 'first', 'nicely', 'couple', 'who', 'genuinely', 'appear', 'be', 'falling', 'love', 'one', 'only', 'one', 'problem', 'problem', 'Rafi', 'therapist', 'Lisa', 'Metzger', 'who', 'just', 'so', 'be', 'David', 'mother.What', 'Prime', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'chemistry', 'stars', 'know', 'Meryl', 'Uma', 'are', 'great', 'actresses', ""n't"", 'always', 'spell', 'out', 'success', 'time', 'Uma', 'Meryl', 'mesh', 'so', 'well', 'together', 'never', 'get', 'feeling', 'forced', 'comedy', 'are', 'enjoying', 'thus', 'are', 'enjoying', 'Even', 'better', 'though', 'romantic', 'chemistry', 'Thurman', 'Bryan', 'Greenberg', 'not', 'hard', 'imagine', 'falling', 'beautiful', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'just', 'attractive', ""n't"", 'mean', 'can', 'fake', 'kind', 'intimacy', 'needed', 'make', 'film', 'work', 'Thurman', 'Greenberg', 'are', 'so', 'natural', 'together', 'so', 'believable', 'tender', 'affectionate', 'fall', 'love', 'them.', 'Prime', 'may', 'seem', 'familiar', 'scenes', ""'m"", 'not', 'denying', 'are', 'streams', 'unoriginality', 'here', 'Prime', 'handles', 'things', 'very', 'mature', 'way', 'not', 'comedy', 'expected', 'see', 'walking', 'really', 'expected', 'run', 'mill', 'gag-filled', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Prime', 'audience', 'sense', 'relatability', 'too', 'often', 'missing', 'rom-coms', 'today.In', 'end', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Prime', 'funny', 'witty', 'sweet', 'most', 'sincere', 'Thurman', 'breathtaking', 'Greenberg', 'charming', 'Streep', 'scene', 'stealing', 'hoot', 'truly', 'prime', 'example', 'movie', 'giving', 'audience', 'what', 'truly', 'deserve']",N/A

Much of this reaction has to do with Uma Thurman.  I've simply not seen a lot of movies with her.  That relative unfamiliarity with her (for me, she's always just been one half of Letterman's famous ""Oprah, Uma, Uma, Oprah"" routine) led to an eye-opening revelation here:  She's a really fine actress.  I was really taken in by her first two scenes with Meryl Streep - sitting across from Streep as analyst, the pain in her life was abundantly evident in her face on her first visit, juxtaposed by evidence of unexpected joy in her next visit.  [Probably the movie's best scene, in which Streep takes one look at the surpressed smile on Thurman's face and impishly says ""Well, let's have it.""]The other highlight, of course, is Streep, who continues to be a wonder...just a completely immersed, completely different person in every role she inhabits.

Uma Thurman is magnificent. The humanity (creativity, life, humor, passion, femininity,...) seem to shine out of her in every scene.  What an attractive PERSON.  Admittedly, I would be entertained watching her solve a rubix cube for an hour and a half, let alone star in a fun plot.  She is a joy to watch.I laughed out loud at Meryl Streep's facial contortions as she learns more and more intimate details about her son, and as she and her husband hide in the furniture store!  She's won more awards for drama, but I think she's very, very funny.  I hope she does more comedy.The young male lead didn't have half the range of expression of either woman, but perhaps he was cast because of this, as a realistic young man, with at times great maturity (dating scenes, scene in elevator), and great immaturity (most of the rest of the time).The ending was difficult because like most ""ugly americans,"" I want things all buttoned up at the end.

The prince of charming happened to be a 23-year old Jew (Bryan Greenberg)whose mom is none other than Merry Streep. She had long insisted upon her son to marry a Jew to preserve faith and culture in the family. So a dilemma lies before the vexed mom - terminate the therapy sessions with Rafi or continue with the therapy but persuade her son to end the relationship?Meryl Streep, as always, is gorgeous in whatever role she plays. She has injected a comic sense in the movie and one can't help feeling for her when she finally allowed her son to bring Rafi to a family gathering. The two women had an emotional reunion.But it is Uma Thurman who has kept the story plausible. Only a 37-year old with Uma's youthful look, slim build, cool job (fashion photographer) and good artistic taste could dazzle a 23-year old as such. And Greenberg as an aspiring painter is excellent.

962082,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B000CS45TC,Cubist,"[13, 17]","Ben Younger's feature film debut was the brash yet hopelessly derivative Boiler Room that featured a cast of up-and-comers (like Giovanni Ribisi and Vin Diesel). The film spent too much time quoting Wall Street and trying too hard to be a new Millennium version of Glengarry Glen Ross. Fortunately, he decided to say something more personal with his next film, Prime that is also rooted more in realism as opposed to the movie quoting machine that was his first movie.It's nice to see Uma Thurman play someone her age and not some immature Barbie doll. She looks stunning as ever but in an approachable way, like her character in Beautiful Girls. Rafi is a very grounded person and the dialogue between her and David is authentic. There is genuine chemistry between the two leads.Younger doesn't overdue it with the kitschy, Gershwin by way of Woody Allen music. The Jewish stereotypes are there but implied and no one is overtly neurotic like in Allen's movies. Younger assumes that we are familiar with this kind of romantic comedy and so he doesn't feel the need to repeat what has already been done. He injects Prime with little moments of unpredictable comedy that aren't too slapsticky but develop gradually.There are a few blemishes on this otherwise fine romantic comedy. David's best friend has an odd quirk. He seems unable (or unwilling) to go on a second date with a woman and ends things by throwing a pie in her face. The first time this happens it is amusing and quirky but it is repeated again and again to disturbing effect to the point where his behaviour borders on seriously misogynistic. Younger never explains why he is like this beyond simple, infantile immaturity.Prime deals with the baggage that comes with the age difference between a significantly younger man and an older woman and how, in the case of these two people, it is very difficult for them to make it work. They want different things - Rafi wants a child and stability while David has trouble holding down a job and isn't sure what he wants to do with his life. Younger resists the urge to go for a pat, feelgood ending, instead maintaining the consistent, realistic tone that sets this film apart from most New York romantic comedies.There are 11 deleted scenes that flesh out the relationships between some of the characters but one can see why they were cut.Also included is an ""Outtakes"" reel with improvised bits and blown lines that are amusing.""Prime-Time Players"" is a making of featurette. Both Streep and Greenberg also praise the reality of Younger's screenplay. He felt that recent romantic comedies had gotten soft and wanted to get back to the realness of movies like Annie Hall and When Harry Met Sally.There is an audio commentary by writer/director Ben Younger and producer Jennifer Todd. They proudly state that the entire film was shot in New York City and point out various locations that were used. However, they tend to spend too much time pointing out various locations - so much so that it feels like some kind of informal tour of the city. This is a loose, informal track as the two crack jokes and provide a smattering of comments in this mixed bag affair.",4,Not your typical New York City-based romantic comedy.,1141344000,"03 3, 2006",2006,3171,"['Ben', 'Younger', 'feature', 'film', 'debut', 'was', 'brash', 'yet', 'hopelessly', 'derivative', 'Boiler', 'Room', 'featured', 'cast', 'up-and-comers', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'film', 'spent', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'quoting', 'Wall', 'Street', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'new', 'Millennium', 'version', 'Glengarry', 'Glen', 'Ross', 'Fortunately', 'decided', 'say', 'something', 'more', 'personal', 'next', 'film', 'Prime', 'also', 'rooted', 'more', 'realism', 'opposed', 'movie', 'quoting', 'machine', 'was', 'first', 'movie.It', 'nice', 'see', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'play', 'someone', 'age', 'not', 'immature', 'Barbie', 'doll', 'stunning', 'ever', 'approachable', 'way', 'character', 'Beautiful', 'Girls', 'Rafi', 'very', 'grounded', 'person', 'dialogue', 'David', 'authentic', 'genuine', 'chemistry', 'two', 'leads.Younger', ""n't"", 'overdue', 'kitschy', 'Gershwin', 'way', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'music', 'Jewish', 'stereotypes', 'are', 'there', 'implied', 'one', 'overtly', 'neurotic', 'Allen', 'movies', 'Younger', 'are', 'familiar', 'kind', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'so', ""n't"", 'feel', 'need', 'repeat', 'what', 'already', 'been', 'done', 'Prime', 'little', 'moments', 'unpredictable', 'comedy', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'slapsticky', 'develop', 'are', 'few', 'blemishes', 'otherwise', 'fine', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'David', 'best', 'friend', 'odd', 'quirk', 'unable', 'unwilling', 'go', 'second', 'date', 'woman', 'things', 'throwing', 'pie', 'face', 'first', 'time', 'amusing', 'quirky', 'repeated', 'again', 'again', 'disturbing', 'effect', 'point', 'where', 'behaviour', 'borders', 'seriously', 'misogynistic', 'Younger', 'never', 'why', 'simple', 'infantile', 'immaturity.Prime', 'deals', 'baggage', 'age', 'difference', 'significantly', 'younger', 'man', 'older', 'woman', 'how', 'case', 'two', 'people', 'very', 'difficult', 'make', 'work', 'want', 'different', 'things', 'Rafi', 'child', 'stability', 'David', 'trouble', 'holding', 'down', 'job', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'do', 'life', 'Younger', 'urge', 'go', 'pat', 'feelgood', 'ending', 'instead', 'maintaining', 'consistent', 'realistic', 'tone', 'film', 'apart', 'most', 'New', 'York', 'romantic', 'comedies.There', 'are', '11', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'flesh', 'out', 'relationships', 'characters', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'were', 'cut.Also', 'included', 'Outtakes', 'reel', 'improvised', 'bits', 'blown', 'lines', 'are', 'amusing', 'Prime-Time', 'Players', 'making', 'featurette', 'Streep', 'Greenberg', 'also', 'praise', 'reality', 'Younger', 'screenplay', 'felt', 'recent', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'had', 'gotten', 'soft', 'wanted', 'get', 'back', 'realness', 'movies', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'When', 'Harry', 'Met', 'Sally.There', 'audio', 'commentary', 'writer/director', 'Ben', 'Younger', 'producer', 'Jennifer', 'Todd', 'proudly', 'state', 'entire', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'point', 'out', 'various', 'locations', 'were', 'used', 'However', 'tend', 'spend', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'pointing', 'out', 'various', 'locations', 'so', 'much', 'kind', 'informal', 'tour', 'city', 'loose', 'informal', 'track', 'two', 'crack', 'jokes', 'provide', 'smattering', 'comments', 'mixed', 'bag', 'affair']",N/A

962087,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000CS45TC,Ed Uyeshima,"[0, 0]","All of 32 years old, director-screenwriter Ben Younger surprises and sometimes confounds with a charming, often perceptive urban comedy that puts a smart spin on the tried-and-true May-December romance. There are definite traces of Woody Allen's ""Annie Hall"" and ""Manhattan"" and even Neil Simon's ""Chapter Two"" when it comes to the ""meet-cute"" scenes. The story centers on Rafi Gardet, who is 37 years old and quite vulnerable after a recent divorce. She dives headlong into a relationship with David Bloomberg, who is 14 years her junior. He's a talented painter with little confidence in earning a living at his art and further saddled by a mother who insists he settle down with a nice Jewish girl. This part of the set-up borders on the predictable, but the unexpected degree of separation between them is what makes this comedy memorable.Enter Lisa Metzger, Rafi's therapist. Dealing with her divorce and her newfound love, Rafi regularly sees her, and of course, shares all her insecurities and intimate secrets. The upshot is that the therapist is also David's mother. No one is aware of this complication until Lisa figures it out during a session with Rafi in what is the movie's comic high point. From that moment on, she has to decide to terminate her sessions with Rafi or do her best to keep her composure and continue the therapy. In fact, she seeks the advice of her own therapist to decide on the right course. Meanwhile, Rafi and Dave encounter choppy waters in their new relationship, and their differing priorities come to the fore.Younger brings an idiosyncratic perspective to this movie that often rises above the formulaic and makes the inevitable shenanigans seem fresh. Although Bryan Greenberg portrays David with just the right balance of youthful zeal and insecurity, it's really the two veteran actresses who shine here. Never more beautiful (if that's possible), Uma Thurman as Rafi has never seemed so spontaneous and likeable onscreen. It's no wonder David falls for her, but what she does with comic dexterity is show why she falls for him. The effectiveness of this kind of performance lies in the details, and Thurman delivers several funny little moments, such as when Rafi explains to David that he should never start a sentence with ""My mom says.."" or when she collapses into a heap upon the discovery that David's roommates are his grandparents. Thurman replaced Sandra Bullock at the 11th hour, and I think the surprise of the resulting casting works in the movie's favor.Speaking of surprises, Meryl Streep manages to pull another one out of her bottomless arsenal of characters and accents, this time, as Lisa. In a precarious balance between attentive Jewish mother and objective professional, she produces the movie's biggest laughs but never at the expense of the character, whether it's her comic responses to Rafi's enthusiasm over David's sexual prowess during their session or her equally embarrassed attempt to hide from the lovers in Crate and Barrel. Streep does not stoop to caricature (like, for example, Barbra Streisand does in ""Meet the Fockers"") but somehow conveys the serious ethical dilemma Lisa has in serving her patient while grappling with being a mother. Even in a seemingly light role as this, Streep continues to be a master at her craft.Younger handles set pieces very well, like the dinner scenes at the Metzger home and even the poolside scene with Rafi's gay friends in the Hamptons. Other aspects of the film don't work as well, for instance, Lisa's stereotypical habit of refrigerating red wine, or David's best friend (played by Jon Abrahams) as a standard-issue smartass who revels in throwing pies at girls who reject him. However, the flaws are minor, as this is a truly enjoyable adult comedy directed and written by a sharp talent and handled by two masterful actresses.",4,Spontaneous Thurman and Masterfully Comical Streep Bolster Newcomer's Sharp Comedy,1130803200,"11 1, 2005",2005,3850,"['32', 'years', 'old', 'director-screenwriter', 'Ben', 'Younger', 'surprises', 'sometimes', 'confounds', 'charming', 'often', 'perceptive', 'urban', 'comedy', 'smart', 'spin', 'tried-and-true', 'May-December', 'romance', 'are', 'definite', 'traces', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'Manhattan', 'even', 'Neil', 'Simon', 'Chapter', 'Two', 'when', 'meet-cute', 'scenes', 'story', 'centers', 'Rafi', 'Gardet', 'who', '37', 'years', 'old', 'quite', 'vulnerable', 'recent', 'divorce', 'headlong', 'relationship', 'David', 'Bloomberg', 'who', '14', 'years', 'junior', 'talented', 'painter', 'little', 'confidence', 'earning', 'living', 'art', 'further', 'saddled', 'mother', 'who', 'settle', 'down', 'nice', 'Jewish', 'girl', 'part', 'set-up', 'borders', 'predictable', 'unexpected', 'degree', 'separation', 'what', 'comedy', 'memorable.Enter', 'Lisa', 'Metzger', 'Rafi', 'therapist', 'Dealing', 'divorce', 'newfound', 'love', 'Rafi', 'regularly', 'course', 'shares', 'insecurities', 'intimate', 'secrets', 'upshot', 'therapist', 'also', 'David', 'mother', 'one', 'aware', 'complication', 'Lisa', 'figures', 'out', 'session', 'Rafi', 'what', 'movie', 'comic', 'high', 'point', 'moment', 'decide', 'terminate', 'sessions', 'Rafi', 'do', 'best', 'keep', 'composure', 'continue', 'therapy', 'fact', 'advice', 'own', 'therapist', 'decide', 'right', 'course', 'Meanwhile', 'Rafi', 'Dave', 'encounter', 'choppy', 'waters', 'new', 'relationship', 'differing', 'priorities', 'come', 'fore.Younger', 'idiosyncratic', 'perspective', 'movie', 'often', 'formulaic', 'inevitable', 'shenanigans', 'seem', 'fresh', 'Bryan', 'Greenberg', 'David', 'just', 'right', 'balance', 'youthful', 'zeal', 'insecurity', 'really', 'two', 'veteran', 'actresses', 'who', 'shine', 'here', 'Never', 'more', 'beautiful', 'possible', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'Rafi', 'never', 'seemed', 'so', 'spontaneous', 'likeable', 'onscreen', 'wonder', 'David', 'what', 'comic', 'dexterity', 'show', 'why', 'effectiveness', 'kind', 'performance', 'lies', 'details', 'Thurman', 'several', 'funny', 'little', 'moments', 'such', 'when', 'Rafi', 'David', 'should', 'never', 'start', 'sentence', 'mom', 'says..', 'when', 'heap', 'discovery', 'David', 'roommates', 'are', 'grandparents', 'Thurman', 'replaced', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', '11th', 'hour', 'think', 'surprise', 'resulting', 'casting', 'works', 'movie', 'favor.Speaking', 'surprises', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'pull', 'one', 'out', 'bottomless', 'arsenal', 'characters', 'accents', 'time', 'Lisa', 'precarious', 'balance', 'attentive', 'Jewish', 'mother', 'objective', 'professional', 'movie', 'biggest', 'laughs', 'never', 'expense', 'character', 'comic', 'responses', 'Rafi', 'enthusiasm', 'David', 'sexual', 'prowess', 'session', 'equally', 'embarrassed', 'attempt', 'hide', 'lovers', 'Crate', 'Barrel', 'Streep', 'not', 'stoop', 'caricature', 'example', 'Barbra', 'Streisand', 'Meet', 'Fockers', 'somehow', 'serious', 'ethical', 'dilemma', 'Lisa', 'serving', 'patient', 'grappling', 'being', 'mother', 'Even', 'seemingly', 'light', 'role', 'Streep', 'be', 'master', 'craft.Younger', 'set', 'pieces', 'very', 'well', 'dinner', 'scenes', 'Metzger', 'home', 'even', 'poolside', 'scene', 'Rafi', 'gay', 'friends', 'Hamptons', 'Other', 'aspects', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'as', 'well', 'instance', 'Lisa', 'stereotypical', 'habit', 'refrigerating', 'red', 'wine', 'David', 'best', 'friend', 'played', 'Jon', 'Abrahams', 'standard-issue', 'smartass', 'who', 'throwing', 'pies', 'girls', 'who', 'reject', 'However', 'flaws', 'are', 'minor', 'truly', 'enjoyable', 'adult', 'comedy', 'directed', 'written', 'sharp', 'talent', 'handled', 'two', 'masterful', 'actresses']",N/A

Comparing to majority of recent romantic comedies, it is smart, interesting, and honest in the way it explores the relationship between an older woman and a younger man and many problems they have to encounter and to deal with.The movie written/directed by Ben Young takes place in the NYC and features a romance between Rafi (Uma Thurman), newly divorced 37 year old and 24 year old kid named Dave. Following her rather bitter and painful divorce, Rafi sees a psychoanalyst named Lisa Metzger (Meryl Streep) who turns out to be the mother of Dave and to whom Rafi unknowingly tells all details including very intimate sexual ones pertaining to her relationship with a young man. When Lisa finds out who the young boyfriend of her patient is, she goes through more than one shock - what complicates the matter even more for Lisa is the fact that Dave is Jewish while Rafi is not. Meryl Streep keeps fascinating me in every movie she graces with her appearance. She makes any movie worth watching bringing depth, class, subtleties, and genuine emotions in all her characters. Uma Thurman was a match for Streep in their scenes together, and they were joy to behold.I loved the movie's ending - there were no questions and no obligatory explanations between the characters. It was not happy (in Hollywood sense) but realistic way to end the relationship. As time passes, life goes on, and we see two people who once had been happy together and even if they were not meant for each other, the memories of happiness would always stay with them.Perhaps the ""Prime"" hit a little close to home - I am a mother of two sons in their 20s and they are always on my mind. I do worry about them and about the choices they make and will make in their lives but I hope that I am not as crazy as Lisa Metzger was. :)3.5/5",3,Surprisingly entertaining and smart romantic comedy,1187827200,"08 23, 2007",2007,1901,"['***', 'comment', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***The', 'more', 'think', 'Prime', '2005', 'more', 'Comparing', 'majority', 'recent', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'smart', 'interesting', 'honest', 'way', 'relationship', 'older', 'woman', 'younger', 'man', 'many', 'problems', 'have', 'encounter', 'deal', 'with.The', 'movie', 'written/directed', 'Ben', 'Young', 'place', 'NYC', 'romance', 'Rafi', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'newly', 'divorced', '37', 'year', 'old', '24', 'year', 'old', 'kid', 'named', 'Dave', 'Following', 'rather', 'bitter', 'painful', 'divorce', 'Rafi', 'psychoanalyst', 'named', 'Lisa', 'Metzger', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'mother', 'Dave', 'whom', 'Rafi', 'unknowingly', 'details', 'including', 'very', 'intimate', 'sexual', 'ones', 'pertaining', 'relationship', 'young', 'man', 'When', 'Lisa', 'out', 'who', 'young', 'boyfriend', 'patient', 'more', 'one', 'shock', 'what', 'matter', 'even', 'more', 'Lisa', 'fact', 'Dave', 'Jewish', 'Rafi', 'not', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'fascinating', 'movie', 'appearance', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'bringing', 'depth', 'class', 'subtleties', 'genuine', 'emotions', 'characters', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'was', 'match', 'Streep', 'scenes', 'together', 'were', 'joy', 'behold.I', 'loved', 'movie', 'ending', 'were', 'questions', 'obligatory', 'explanations', 'characters', 'was', 'not', 'happy', 'Hollywood', 'sense', 'realistic', 'way', 'end', 'relationship', 'time', 'passes', 'life', 'see', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'once', 'had', 'been', 'happy', 'together', 'even', 'were', 'not', 'meant', 'other', 'memories', 'happiness', 'would', 'always', 'stay', 'them.Perhaps', 'Prime', 'hit', 'little', 'close', 'home', 'am', 'mother', 'two', 'sons', '20s', 'are', 'always', 'mind', 'do', 'worry', 'choices', 'make', 'will', 'make', 'lives', 'hope', 'am', 'not', 'as', 'crazy', 'Lisa', 'Metzger', 'was', '3.5/5']",N/A

This is a solid little work by writer/director Ben Younger who has created a story, somewhat autobiographical, and engaged the interest and devotion of some very fine actors to bring off this simple but very honest view of love and its permutations.Rafi (Uma Thurman) is a recently divorced, successful fashion worker (she sets up camera shoots for high fashion photographers) who is in therapy with the sensitive and understanding therapist Liza Metzger (Meryl Streep) who supports Rafi's need for love and encourages her to put her bad marriage behind her and find someone who will appreciate her. Reluctantly re-entering the dating scene Rafi meets young artist-wannabe David Bloomberg (Bryan Greenberg) and a chemistry develops between them that eventually results in their meaningful bonding.  There are problems to face: Rafi is a 37-year-old Gentile divorcee and David is a 23-year-old Jewish unemployed kid.  But the biggest problem is that Rafi's therapist and David's mother are one and the same person!  Lisa is conflicted, wanting to provide on-going therapy for Rafi whom she sincerely cares about while insisting that David marry a Jewish girl and not be involved with an older woman!  The manner in which this problematic triad is worked through, and it is a bumpy ride, is the story of the film.The atmosphere of this on the surface illogical story is so well realized - the Jewish family scenes are very funny, the warmth of the relationship between Rafi and David say a lot about love despite hurdles, the inner struggle Lisa faces with her own therapist - that the movie is a natural joy to watch.  Meryl Streep gives a fine turn as Lisa, and Uma Thurman and newcomer Bryan Greenberg deliver a wholly credible couple with a fine screen chemistry.  This is far more than the usual 'chick flick': this is a little look at human interactions, sensitively related by a fine cast and crew and a film that deserves serious attention as what Romantic Comedies can really be.

Great potential for clich&eacute;, right? ""Love conquers all"" and all that. But ""Prime"" treats its audience with a bit of intelligence, providing delightful servings of both drama and comedy. Uma Thurman plays Rafi, a fashion maven whose marriage just fell apart. She bumps into 23-year-old David (played with intelligence and bumbling charm by Bryan Greenberg) at a movie theater. The pair can't take their eyes off each other and are soon a going thing.A couple of mild spoilers: Rafi's spills the beans on her new relationship to her therapist, played with ticky hilarity by Meryl Streep. All is well until it dawns on Streep that Rafi's new paramour is none other than her own son. This much you could glean from the DVD cover. The movie's comedy comes from watching Streep's discomfort as she hears more than she wants to about her kid. But leavening the laughs is the truly serious story of two people wondering whether they are right for each other and whether the age difference can be overcome in spite of the fire of their passion. Greenberg finds the razor's edge to play a David who mature and sensitive --for his age -- but still a kid at heart. Rafi loves her new lover, but wonders about integrating him into her circle of close and quirky friends. David's piggish friend Morris is the perfect comic foil, diverting the excess comic energy from David -- who must remain as serious as he is funny. The movie does not downplay the difficulties of its character's differences and the surprise ending is the perfect topper for this smart, engaging film.",4,Skirting the clich&eacute;s,1218067200,"08 7, 2008",2008,1663,"['23-year-old', 'man', 'older', '37-year-old', 'woman', 'therapist', 'young', 'man', 'mom', 'Great', 'potential', 'clich', 'eacute', 'right', 'Love', 'conquers', 'Prime', 'audience', 'bit', 'intelligence', 'providing', 'delightful', 'servings', 'drama', 'comedy', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'Rafi', 'fashion', 'maven', 'marriage', 'just', 'fell', 'apart', 'bumps', '23-year-old', 'David', 'played', 'intelligence', 'bumbling', 'charm', 'Bryan', 'Greenberg', 'movie', 'theater', 'pair', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'eyes', 'other', 'are', 'soon', 'going', 'thing.A', 'couple', 'mild', 'spoilers', 'Rafi', 'beans', 'new', 'relationship', 'therapist', 'played', 'ticky', 'hilarity', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'well', 'Streep', 'Rafi', 'new', 'paramour', 'none', 'other', 'own', 'son', 'much', 'could', 'glean', 'DVD', 'cover', 'movie', 'comedy', 'watching', 'Streep', 'discomfort', 'more', 'kid', 'leavening', 'laughs', 'truly', 'serious', 'story', 'two', 'people', 'wondering', 'are', 'right', 'other', 'age', 'difference', 'can', 'be', 'overcome', 'spite', 'fire', 'passion', 'Greenberg', 'razor', 'edge', 'play', 'David', 'who', 'mature', 'sensitive', 'age', 'still', 'kid', 'heart', 'Rafi', 'new', 'lover', 'wonders', 'integrating', 'circle', 'close', 'quirky', 'friends', 'David', 'piggish', 'friend', 'Morris', 'perfect', 'comic', 'foil', 'diverting', 'excess', 'comic', 'energy', 'David', 'who', 'must', 'remain', 'as', 'serious', 'funny', 'movie', 'not', 'downplay', 'difficulties', 'character', 'differences', 'surprise', 'ending', 'perfect', 'topper', 'smart', 'engaging', 'film']",N/A

""A New Yorker""","[4, 6]","If I didn't know better I would say this is an infomercial for all Jewish mothers who are really concerned that their sons marry nice Jewish girls, have Jewish kids....well you get the idea.Although this film is promoted for its sophisticated storyline, Meryl Streep adds the only charisma and sophistication to the entire film. Streep definitely outshines Uma Thurman and Bryan Greenberg in this film. In fact, she is the only person carrying it. Her acting is superb as always, and she delivers her lines with impeccable timing and emotion. Thurman and Greenberg, on the other hand, appear like two awkward teenagers throughout the film. They had zero chemistry, and Greenberg's acting fed nothing to Thurman for her to work off of. Greenburg, despite his dashing, cute puppy looks, could not carry the leading man role because he seemed afraid to take the reigns. But Thurman wasn't better off anyway; it seemed like she was trying to take hold of her role throughout the entire film but she just couldn't get it right for some reason. Maybe the concept of the film was just too hard for her to work with, or maybe the script itself just gave her very little to begin with. Nonetheless, Rafi and Dave's dialog is trite, clich&eacute;, and very middle school at times. Everything they said to each other seemed expected of them and didn't add any new insights to their intellect, emotional maturity, or the maturity of the relationship. You could never really understand why the two were together besides the excitement from the age difference and the sexual exploration. Their romance unfolds in the most obvious and least charming fashion. The dates they go on seem unrealistic for a 37-year-old divorc&eacute;e. (i.e. Underground rap clubs.) All of the romance that is supposed to touch you and bring you closer to the characters really just pushes you away because the scenes seemed force.And you can't help but notice that their relationship is based on a large part on sex, which doesn't add any dimension to the characters or the story. Perhaps this is why it is so hard to swallow anything when both Rafi and Dave claim that they love each other. Because you can't help but think that they're merely infatuated with each other and this new experience and that it's not really love at all. Despite the fact that Rafi insists to her therapist/Dave's mom that she is serious about this relationship, it is hard to believe because you see nothing that Rafi and Dave have in common besides art and even that link is iffy and seems tacked on just to draw some connection between them. Younger never gives the characters real dimension or qualities that would make the audience draw towards them, so when the film ends, you don't feel the connection with the characters that is needed for the ending to be felt the way Younger wants it to be felt.""Prime"" is interesting enough to ask the right questions about age and relationships and the outcome of the decisions made.

962106,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B000CS45TC,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[2, 2]","Following up the ""Kill Bill"" movies, Uma Thurman takes a completely different direction for the romantic comedy ""Prime"". While this movie is destined to be labeled as a romantic comedy, it's not a romantic comedy in the traditional sense of that word. It doesn't have the cheesy music and the bad dialogue...Well, it does kinda. The movie has it's romantic comedy stereotypes and all, but at the end it takes a different direction. The end of the film is kind of depressing and perfect...The movie itself, however, is far from perfect. It's flawed, but entertaining and at times very funny. Thurman plays Rafi, a recently divorced 37-year old woman, who's trying to return her to life to normal while seeing a therapist (Meryl Streep, far from Oscar territory). Then there's David (Bryan Greenberg), a 23 year old aspiring painter who lives with his grandparents and spends his days with a friend who throws pies in the faces of woman who don't have sex with him. The ""pie"" scene was one of the funniest scenes I've seen in a romantic comedy lately. Anyway, David and Rafi meet and despite their age begin to fall in love. Problem is, David's mother happens to be Rafi's therapist. The movie does a nice job of building up to the audience discovering this, although the audience probably already knows at this point. Unlike movies, such asRumor Has It, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, Failure to Launch, and others (although I did like all three of those movies) this movie does not share that mood and that cute quality. It's a much more moodier, sadder romantic comedy. It belongs up there in the category of ""Shopgirl"" (although, for the record, that was a much better film). Anyway, just because it's different doesn't mean its better than the forementioned films but that doesn't mean you shouldn't watch it either. Thurman and Greenberg have a good charisma on screen together and Streep shows some of her comedic talents. Thurman and Streep are both a long way from their other film roles, but they still pull it off.GRADE: B+",4,Different Than Most Romantic Comedies,1147824000,"05 17, 2006",2006,2031,"['Following', 'up', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'movies', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'completely', 'different', 'direction', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Prime', 'movie', 'destined', 'be', 'labeled', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'not', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'traditional', 'sense', 'word', ""n't"", 'have', 'cheesy', 'music', 'bad', 'dialogue', 'Well', 'kinda', 'movie', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'stereotypes', 'end', 'different', 'direction', 'end', 'film', 'kind', 'depressing', 'perfect', 'movie', 'however', 'far', 'perfect', 'flawed', 'entertaining', 'times', 'very', 'funny', 'Thurman', 'Rafi', 'recently', 'divorced', '37-year', 'old', 'woman', 'who', 'trying', 'return', 'life', 'normal', 'seeing', 'therapist', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'far', 'Oscar', 'territory', 'Then', 'David', 'Bryan', 'Greenberg', '23', 'year', 'old', 'aspiring', 'painter', 'who', 'grandparents', 'days', 'friend', 'who', 'pies', 'woman', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'sex', 'pie', 'scene', 'was', 'one', 'funniest', 'scenes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'lately', 'Anyway', 'David', 'Rafi', 'meet', 'age', 'begin', 'fall', 'love', 'Problem', 'David', 'mother', 'be', 'Rafi', 'therapist', 'movie', 'nice', 'job', 'building', 'up', 'audience', 'discovering', 'audience', 'probably', 'already', 'point', 'movies', 'such', 'asRumor', 'Has', 'How', 'Lose', 'Guy', '10', 'Days', 'Failure', 'Launch', 'others', 'did', 'three', 'movies', 'movie', 'not', 'share', 'mood', 'cute', 'quality', 'much', 'more', 'moodier', 'sadder', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'up', 'there', 'category', 'Shopgirl', 'record', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'Anyway', 'just', 'different', ""n't"", 'mean', 'better', 'forementioned', 'films', ""n't"", 'mean', 'should', ""n't"", 'watch', 'either', 'Thurman', 'Greenberg', 'have', 'good', 'charisma', 'screen', 'together', 'Streep', 'comedic', 'talents', 'Thurman', 'Streep', 'are', 'long', 'way', 'other', 'film', 'roles', 'still', 'pull', 'B+']",N/A
962107,ALLJT7S5QOFFZ,B000CS45TC,kaduzy,"[1, 1]","I've been meaning to watch this romantic comedy for years, and now that I've finally seen it, I'm just sorry that it took me so long to get around to it.  It is a well-written, well-performed, sweet and realistic depiction of love between an older woman and a younger man, and a therapist with strong ties to them both.In the one featurette included with the extras, writer/director Ben Younger mentions his inspirations: ""Annie Hall"", ""When Harry Met Sally . . ."", ""Manhattan"" -- and sure enough, the movie really is a throwback to those great romantic comedies.  As he says very clearly, it's not ""broad"" -- it's not some Kate Hudson vehicle designed by a studio to hit a major demographic.  It's a very New York story, and he uses the city wonderfully to help him tell his story. Nothing feels like a set.  And nothing feels forced.  The movie made me laugh harder than anything I have seen in a while, yet there are really no ""jokes"" in it (apart from the dorky ones the male lead tells).  Instead, he uses his characters to create humor with the awkward situations they find themselves in, and he allows his talented team of actors to create it with their performances.What this film is, is very grown-up.  One of the most mature and thoughtful romantic comedies I've seen in years.  There's no ""meet cute"", no complicated premise, no real ""hook"".  It really takes skill to create a movie of this genre where you actually wind up making an emotional investment in the characters, and that is a testament to the script even more so than the players.  That the script came from the same guy who brought us ""Boiler Room"" in 2000 is slightly surprising, but that movie definitely had its moments too.  Clearly Ben Younger is getting better and better over time.  And given the apparent 5-year pattern, maybe next year we'll get another one that's even better than this!Aside from the aforementioned feauturette, extras include deleted scenes (one of which reveals exactly what it is that Uma's character does for a living), outtakes and a commentary by Ben Younger.

I think that the camera hates ""acting"" and these actors were simply great, to me they were real people and not a bunch of Hollywood folk trying to earn a buck by filming some speedy crappy movie.What I liked about the movie was how Rafi, Thurman's character brough the son and monther togehter, because she made the tough and strict Jewish mother realise what her son wants in life, and to support and encourage him, instead of closing off. She opened up tp his world and made made fis own life bloom.This movie is unlike many silly romantic comedies that dissapear in your memory soon after.

962109,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B000CS45TC,Kevin Killian,"[4, 4]","I enjoyed this film and sat through the whole thing waiting to see how it turns out, so that puts it a step beyond most pictures, the kind I walk out on.  That's not to say that PRIME isn't mindnumbingly predictable, because it's filled with chunky bits from other, older, better movies.  And yet, the original part is so different that it stands out in a field of romantic competition.  I see the movie as the story of Morris, a 23 year old prodigy who suffers from a sexual tragedy involving not being able to get a second date from any woman he goes out with.  A bizarre, Kraft-Ebing compulsion then demands that he seeks vengeance by throwing a pie in their faces.  I suppose it's the spectacle of their beautiful faces just peering in anguish through a cloud of fluffy meringue that must turn Morris on, perhaps a sublimated form of the so-called ""money shot"" X rated movies depend on.  In any case, PRIME follows Morris around on expeditions related to his pie fetish, shopping with a friend (Bryan Greenberg as ""David,"" the painter of modern life) at a light-filled bakery and inquiring of the shopgirl if the pie was baked fresh today.I wonder if that was to assuage the feelings of the audience, to make sure we knew that no females were hurt during the making of the film, and perhaps to indicare that Morris actually doesn't want to injury these girls permanently (writer director Ben Younger, who also made the superior BOILER ROOM years back, indicates that Morris uses only cream pies in these attacks).  For a pecan pie or something like that would do quite a bit of damage.  Yet the film remains a cold, clinical picture of a man out of control, with sociopathic dimensions, and as such it would make a good double bill with HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER, or perhaps Michael Powell's PEEPING TOM.The accoutrements of his crime slide by the other characters in the movie, although Uma Thurman (as fashion photographer Rafi) is justifiably upset when she finds Morrie in her closet, rendering her pet cat unconscious with a bottle of beer).  Most of the time, they're just thinking, ""Pie throwing, a staple of American comedies since Mack Sennett's Keystone Kops,"" so something in our movie going experience has hot-wired the human body to associate a pie in the face with laughter, and Younger wants to peel back those associations and reveal pie throwing as the hate crime it is.SPOILER WARNING: At the end of the film, Morris gets his comeuppance, and the sight of his handsome, well, goofy face ringed with cream gleams with neo-expressionist horror, like the skinned face in Michele Soavi's Italian horror film LA SETTA.",4,American Pie,1164758400,"11 29, 2006",2006,2644,"['enjoyed', 'film', 'sat', 'whole', 'thing', 'waiting', 'see', 'how', 'out', 'step', 'most', 'pictures', 'kind', 'walk', 'out', 'not', 'say', 'PRIME', ""n't"", 'mindnumbingly', 'predictable', 'filled', 'chunky', 'bits', 'other', 'older', 'better', 'movies', 'yet', 'original', 'part', 'so', 'different', 'out', 'field', 'romantic', 'competition', 'see', 'movie', 'story', 'Morris', '23', 'year', 'old', 'prodigy', 'who', 'sexual', 'tragedy', 'involving', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'get', 'second', 'date', 'woman', 'out', 'bizarre', 'Kraft-Ebing', 'compulsion', 'then', 'vengeance', 'throwing', 'pie', 'suppose', 'spectacle', 'beautiful', 'just', 'peering', 'anguish', 'cloud', 'fluffy', 'meringue', 'must', 'turn', 'Morris', 'perhaps', 'sublimated', 'form', 'so-called', 'money', 'shot', 'X', 'rated', 'movies', 'depend', 'case', 'PRIME', 'Morris', 'expeditions', 'related', 'pie', 'fetish', 'shopping', 'friend', 'Bryan', 'Greenberg', 'David', 'painter', 'modern', 'life', 'light-filled', 'bakery', 'inquiring', 'shopgirl', 'pie', 'was', 'baked', 'fresh', 'today.I', 'wonder', 'was', 'assuage', 'feelings', 'audience', 'make', 'sure', 'knew', 'females', 'were', 'hurt', 'making', 'film', 'perhaps', 'indicare', 'Morris', 'actually', ""n't"", 'want', 'injury', 'girls', 'permanently', 'writer', 'director', 'Ben', 'Younger', 'who', 'also', 'made', 'superior', 'BOILER', 'ROOM', 'years', 'back', 'Morris', 'only', 'cream', 'pies', 'attacks', 'pecan', 'pie', 'something', 'would', 'do', 'quite', 'bit', 'damage', 'film', 'cold', 'clinical', 'picture', 'man', 'control', 'sociopathic', 'dimensions', 'such', 'would', 'make', 'good', 'double', 'bill', 'HENRY', 'PORTRAIT', 'A', 'SERIAL', 'KILLER', 'perhaps', 'Michael', 'Powell', 'PEEPING', 'TOM.The', 'accoutrements', 'crime', 'slide', 'other', 'characters', 'movie', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'fashion', 'Rafi', 'justifiably', 'upset', 'when', 'Morrie', 'closet', 'rendering', 'pet', 'cat', 'unconscious', 'bottle', 'beer', 'Most', 'time', ""'re"", 'just', 'thinking', 'Pie', 'throwing', 'staple', 'American', 'comedies', 'Mack', 'Sennett', 'Keystone', 'Kops', 'so', 'something', 'movie', 'going', 'experience', 'hot-wired', 'human', 'body', 'associate', 'pie', 'face', 'laughter', 'Younger', 'peel', 'back', 'associations', 'reveal', 'pie', 'throwing', 'hate', 'crime', 'WARNING', 'end', 'film', 'Morris', 'comeuppance', 'sight', 'handsome', 'well', 'goofy', 'face', 'ringed', 'cream', 'gleams', 'neo-expressionist', 'horror', 'skinned', 'face', 'Michele', 'Soavi', 'Italian', 'horror', 'film', 'LA', 'SETTA']",N/A
962110,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000CS45TC,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 2]","As ""Prime"" unfolded before me, I was initially swept up with the story it had to tell.  The chemistry and easy charm between Uma Thurman and Bryan Greenberg impressed me, and their subsequent romance and sexual liaison seemed credible.  I also enjoyed the relationship between Thurman and her therapist played by Meryl Streep--again, lots of naturalness and humor.  Of course, you all know that Streep is Greenberg's mother and that will set off a series of complications.The film is most successful when dealing with these relationships, and the sweet and thoughtful cadence is appreciated.  The moments of broader humor, while sometimes funny, seem at odds with the story the film is trying to tell.  I liked the performances, too.  Thurman, especially, is evolving nicely as an actress.  But the longer the film went on, the more cynical I became.  Something in the tone just wasn't right, something started bothering me.I found certain elements of the film unsettling when I thought about it too much.  There is a slight undercurrent of prejudice that wafts through the film.  I know that there is still a reality to people wanting their children to marry within their own faith--but Streep's character is a therapist.  She and her husband seem happy and progressive, yet can't entertain the idea of their son even dating someone who isn't Jewish.  And when he dates a black girl, he can't even tell them.  It's all so old fashioned in viewpoint and not particularly kosher.  And Thurman's character pretty much supports her young lover.  No one ever raises the question of his being a kept man--but that's precisely what he becomes.  That certainly wouldn't be unusual in the circles she travels in--but the fact that no one even mentions it seems unlikely.  Her friends are too busy swooning at the romance to be the slightest bit skeptical of the motivation behind it.This is just my ""read"" on the film--some of the feelings it stirred in me.  I doubt that others will feel the same way necessarily.  But if I wasn't left with these odd impressions, I surely would have rated this at 4 stars.  You can do a lot worse than ""Prime""--most of the film I enjoyed as thoughtful and sincere.

Vitale,"[1, 1]","Yes, this movie is a total chick flick and I wouldn't say this movie should win an academy award, but that doesn't mean it isn't any good as others who reviewed this movie have suggested. ""Prime"" is a wonderfully refreshing romance with a different ending then one might think!Uma Thurman plays the role of the 37 year old recently divorced woman whom begins dating Meryl Streep's 23 year old son in ""Prime"". Streep's character just so happens to also be the psychotherapist to Thurman's character. Thurman's character falls hard for Streep's son in the movie but has a difficult accepting the 14 year age difference. The movie focuses on the relationship between Thruman's character and that of her new love.The movie also deals with the issue of both Streep's and Thurman's characters not know that Thurman is actually dating Streep's son in the movie for quite some time. So, here Thurman's character unknowingly divulges intimate details about her new  relationship with the mother of her new boyfriend who happens to be her psychotherapist! Steep's character finds out that Thurman is dating her son 5 weeks before Thurman's character does, but decides to keep this information to herself until she can no longer handle hearing the intimate details and severs Thurman's character as her client.I also thought the acting was great!! Both Uma Thurman & Meryl Streep gave great performances in ""Prime"" and am not sure why others have dogged Ms. Streep's acting abilities in this film. Meryl Streep does a wonderful job playing the psychotherapist, who has problems of her own. Streep's character has a difficult time with accepting her 23 year old son dating a 37 year old divorcee who is not Jewish and just so happens to be one of her clients. Meryl Streep's character seems more accepting of her patients behavior than that of her own son's. She doesn't want her son to choose being an artist as a career option. In the movie Streep's character finally comes to terms with the relationship and her son's choice to be come an artist! So, ""Prime"" is a feel good movie in that regard.

A man and a woman and how they tackle obstacles and finally happy together is the basic form of the very popular romance genre. The rest of the Hollywood romance story is to twist it as much as possible.They start with age segmentation ""Melody Fair"" / ""On Golden Pond""; to race ""Far From Heaven"" / ""The World of Suzie Wong""; to different sex orientation ""La Cage Aux Folles""; you can name as many variations as you want. And, of course, cross over i.e. mixing genre: comedy/romance ""When Harry Meet Sally""; thriller/romance ""Vertigo""; action/romance ""Bonnie & Clyde"", is another popular choice; and they did try every possible mixing as you can imagine.""Prime"" is another effort from Hollywood to extend this formula. However, new twist doesn't guarantee success; that is why they always deploy top notch actors and actress to ensure their effort is not in vain e.g. ""Something's Gotta to Give (2003)"" with Jack Nicholson, Diane Keaton, Keanu Reeves. Can you think of better deployment than these? This time the twist is about a young guy with an older divorc&eacute;e and his mother happens to be her therapist. It certainly sounds interesting even without seeing the film yourself. On top of that, you got two Oscar frequent visitors - Uma Thurman & Meryl Streep.Unfortunately, the interesting part stops right there. You would expect lots of fun part come from this to-be-discovered relationships and a new interpretation of these roles from these top stars. But as most failure efforts did, the film has several funny scenes but doesn't add together and after the relationship-discovery it actually falls apart or should I say nothing surprise us. (Resolution of conflict relationship is a good line to play with, but the screen writer just threw it away!) Another recent failure along the same line is ""Must Have Dog (2005)"".The rule of thumb of genre development is to provide reasonable plot expectation for the audience and add some twists here and there to surpass their expectation. A recent good example is ""Just Like Heaven (2005)"". The film provides some twists into a so- familiar plot i.e. ""Ghost (1990)"".

962118,A3ONTLXQ85EE4G,B000CS45TC,Marshall Lord,"[0, 0]","This is a well written, often laugh-out-loud funny, sometimes sad romantic comedy about love and relationships.Writer/Director Ben Younger said that his inspiration for the film was that at one stage he was going out with a woman who was having therapy, and his mother was a therapist. As his mother had remarried and did not share his surname, he asked himself what would happen if his partner accidentally went to his mum for therapy, and then he thought ""that's a great idea for a movie.""However, although this is indeed one of the major story elements and the source of many of the best laughs in the film, there is quite a lot more to this film than this hugely embarassing coincidence,Uma Thurman plays Raphael (Rafi) Gardet, a 37 year old, highly successful career woman in the fashion industry, who at the start of the film has just got divorced. By chance at a film she is introduced to David Bloomborg (played by David Greenberg), a 23 year old who wants to be an artist. The two are hugely physically attracted to each other: before they realise quite how large the age difference is David invites Rafi out on a date, and although she is very nervous of the difference in age, Rafi enjoys his company so much that they start a passionate affair.As soon as Rafi walks into the office of her therapist Lisa Motzgor (Meryl Streep), Lisa can see that Rafi has met someone who is making her happy. Initialy Lisa is pleased for Rafi and encourages her in the relationship. It is only two or three sessions later, as Rafi starts to pour out details of the relationship, that Lisa first suspects that Rafi may be dating her own son, then confirms that this is indeed the case and realises with horror that she has been encouraging a divorcee more than half again his age to have an affair with her son. This would have been difficult enough for anyone, but to make matters worse, though she is tolerant in most ways Lisa has an extreme hostility bordering on bigotry against mixed marriages and does not want her Jewish son to marry a gentile.This leads to a comedy of embarrassment, with Lisa's behaviour becoming increasingly preposterous as she tries with disastrous lack of success to do what is right for both her son and her client. Meanwhile Rafi is trying to cope with the fact that David is in some ways a wonderful man who can make her very happy, and in other ways much less mature than she needs in a long term partner. All the characters in the film have some difficult decisions to make and at times the film is decidedly bittersweet.The most difficult part of this film to make must have been the ending. Ben Younger and the cast play this in a very grown-up way: some people will like the ending but it will leave others unsatisfied - I can't really say more without giving it away.There is some really good acting in this film. The three main actors, Uma Thurman, Bryan Greenberg and Meryl Streep are all superb. Ato Essandoh delivers a brilliantly memorable cameo as the doorman of the apartment building where Rafi lives. It seems to be compulsory these days for romantic comedies to include an obnoxious sexist lothario as the hero's best friend, and this part is played with slightly more sophistication than usual by Jon Abrahams - at least, he is more sophisticated when he isn't exercising his original technique for dumping a girlfriend by means of a custard pie in her face.Overall this is a very cleverly crafted and entertaining film.

The situation is not very believable (a woman seeing a much younger man who happens to be her therapist's son), but the greatest disappointment is the fact that the movie doesn't have much of a plot to go on.  It is almost like a half-hour sitcom stretched out too far.  After Lisa, the therapist, reveals to Rafi that she knows that the man she's dating is her son, there isn't much left to go on.David and Rafi are happy at first.  Then there's friction after David moves in with Rafi (understandably) because he appears to be taking advantage of her.  She breaks up with David; then they're back together.  The they break up again.  It's almost as though the writer is buying time in order to make a movie.I also found Rafi's detailed descriptions to Lisa about her sex life with David to be in extremely poor taste.  Also the fact that Lisa seems more concerned that Rafi isn't Jewish than she is about the fact that she's much older than David isn't believable.  The idea of David' best friend throwing pies in the faces of girl who reject him is really dumb.There are only two good things I can say about Prime.

""Prime"" is one of those rare instances where the film never quite comes together in spite of Streep's awesomeness.Part of the problem is that Streep's role in this movie is only supporting. The real star is Uma Thurman, who plays 37-year-old Rafi, a recently divorced woman who finds love in the most unexpected place: with 23-year-old Daniel (Bryan Greenberg), an aspiring painter. Streep plays Lisa, Rafi's warm and compassionate therapist who also happens to be Daniel's mother.I thought the plot of this film would revolve more around Streep's character and the angst she feels when she discovers that her patient is actually dating her son. However, the focus of this film is the relationship between Daniel and Rafi: what works and what doesn't, and why some couples are destined to be together and others just aren't. ""Prime"" is refreshing in that it takes an honest and adult look at relationships and acknowledges that some romances are pretty much doomed from the start...and that's not necessarily a terrible thing. However, the advertising for this film was very poorly handled because the trailers depicted the movie as a comedy featuring Streep and Thurman going at each other's throats, and it wasn't like that at all.

When she is not working, Streep has the role of the stereotypical Jewish mother who frets over her son.  One day she meets a much younger man, David 23.  She starts talking to Streep about David but tells him he is 27.  The audience realizes that David is in fact Streep's son but Streep has no way of knowing.  Thurman asks her if she should really consider pursuing David, since he is so much younger.  Streep tells her to go ahead and that it might help get her out of her depression.Things get hairier as Thurman and David become lovers and Thurman starts describing in vivid detail to Streep about their encounters.  Pretty soon Streep starts to figure out that Thurman's David is the same David that is her son.  This almost causes her to have a heart attack since Thurman is not Jewish and a lot older and Streep knows all the graphic play by play of what has been transpiring between the two of them.When she finally gets her own bearings she goes to her own psychologist to seek advice.  Streep explains her moral dilemma and whether she should tell Thurman about her conflict of interest and stop treating her.  The psychologist suggests that it is probably a fling that David will be done with in a couple of weeks and that if Streep has been very beneficial to Thurman then the disruption would probably cause Thurman to regress,  Streep then feels it is in the best interest to continue to council Thurman no matter how personally embarrassing it may be.What follows is a lot of uncomfortable conversations between Streep and Thurman where we see Streep with all her remarkable talent, squirming at the details that Thurman is presenting.  Of course the audience knows that this will not be a fling and things will continue to get more dicey for Streep as the couple's relationship seems to progress to the next level.This is a really fun movie and it is nice to see that Streep is just as brilliant in doing comedy as her usual drama fare.",4,A Pleasant Surprise!,1167264000,"12 28, 2006",2006,2070,"['Surprisingly', 'good', 'comedy', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'who', 'seeing', 'psychologist', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'recent', 'divorce', 'When', 'not', 'working', 'Streep', 'role', 'stereotypical', 'Jewish', 'mother', 'who', 'son', 'One', 'day', 'much', 'younger', 'man', 'David', '23', 'talking', 'Streep', 'David', '27', 'audience', 'David', 'fact', 'Streep', 'son', 'Streep', 'way', 'knowing', 'Thurman', 'should', 'really', 'consider', 'pursuing', 'David', 'so', 'much', 'younger', 'Streep', 'go', 'ahead', 'might', 'help', 'get', 'depression.Things', 'get', 'hairier', 'Thurman', 'David', 'become', 'lovers', 'Thurman', 'describing', 'vivid', 'detail', 'Streep', 'encounters', 'Pretty', 'soon', 'Streep', 'figure', 'out', 'Thurman', 'David', 'same', 'David', 'son', 'almost', 'have', 'heart', 'attack', 'Thurman', 'not', 'Jewish', 'lot', 'older', 'Streep', 'graphic', 'play', 'play', 'what', 'been', 'transpiring', 'two', 'them.When', 'finally', 'own', 'bearings', 'own', 'psychologist', 'seek', 'advice', 'Streep', 'moral', 'dilemma', 'should', 'tell', 'Thurman', 'conflict', 'interest', 'stop', 'treating', 'psychologist', 'probably', 'fling', 'David', 'will', 'be', 'done', 'couple', 'weeks', 'Streep', 'been', 'very', 'beneficial', 'Thurman', 'then', 'disruption', 'would', 'probably', 'cause', 'Thurman', 'regress', 'Streep', 'then', 'best', 'interest', 'continue', 'council', 'Thurman', 'matter', 'how', 'personally', 'embarrassing', 'may', 'be.What', 'lot', 'uncomfortable', 'conversations', 'Streep', 'Thurman', 'where', 'see', 'Streep', 'remarkable', 'talent', 'squirming', 'details', 'Thurman', 'presenting', 'course', 'audience', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'fling', 'things', 'will', 'continue', 'get', 'more', 'dicey', 'Streep', 'couple', 'relationship', 'progress', 'next', 'level.This', 'really', 'fun', 'movie', 'nice', 'see', 'Streep', 'just', 'as', 'brilliant', 'doing', 'comedy', 'usual', 'drama', 'fare']",N/A

The characters and the issues involved are real, and the film has an honest ending; the right ending.  I loved this movie.Uma Thurman stars as a 37-year-old divorcee who falls for a 23-year old struggling, albeit talented, painter (Bryan Greenberg).  Her shrink (Meryl Streep) initially approves of the relationship, because she thinks it will help her patient get out of her post-divorce funk.However, after a couple of weeks, Streep realizes that the new man in Uma's life is, in fact, her own son.Now, what does she do?  Drop Uma as a patient...or continue to treat her?One thing that she does not want is for Bryan to be involved with Uma.  As Meryl sees it, the age difference is not the only problem with the relationship.  She's also concerned that Uma is not Jewish.There are some very funny scenes in this picture, such as the therapy sessions in which Uma describes to Meryl, in graphic detail, her sex life with her new boy friend.

As the plot progresses, through connections with their friends Rafi and David Bloomberg get acquainted with one another and start dating. The problem is, David is Lisa's son! Eventually, Lisa finds out that their dating but in their therapy sessions makes every effort not to bring it up with Rafi. One memorable scene is when Rafi discusses David ""ahem"" schlong to Lisa in their therapy is where the hilarity ensues. Streep's stunned look in disbelief as she reaches for her glass of water as Rafi describes in lurid detail her sex life with David was the funniest scene of this movie.There is nothing new told in the story of Prime but the acting and the humor involved made this a fun filled and entertaining movie of a 23-year old boy dating a 37-year old woman divorcee and whether there can be love after a bad and messy divorce.

It's much more than that, though, and if you've never seen it, it deserves being revisited.How, then, to explain Prime, Younger's second outing? Younger's wannabe romantic comedy gives us Lisa Metzger (Meryl Streep), a psychoanalyst who's counseling Rafi Gardet (Uma Thurman) through a messy divorce. Rafi perks up when she meets a younger man who lights her fire-- but it escapes both Rafi and Lisa that said younger man is Lisa's son David (One Tree Hill's Bryan Greenberg). Needless to say, the balancing act can't go on forever, and what's going to happen when everyone finds out about everyone else?This had the potential to be an interesting take on the love triangle, but instead it comes off rather as a mediocre adaptation of a Woody Allen movie. The script spends a lot of time obsessed with Lisa's family's archetypal (in some cases, verging on stereotypical) Jewishness as a source of its comedy. It never really gets offensive, but it does come off as cliched now and again. And the movie does have a number of funny scenes (mostly in David's interactions with his grandmother) and some good performances (look, especially, for Blood Diamond's Ato Essandoh in a small, but wonderful, role), but the whole never really coheres into anything other than your typical comedy of errors. ** ",3,...meh.,1166572800,"12 20, 2006",2006,1498,"['Prime', 'Ben', 'Younger', '2005', 'Ben', 'Younger', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'Boiler', 'Room', 'unjustly', 'obscure', 'expose', 'stock', 'scams', 'mostly', 'known', 'days', 'being', 'one', 'stop', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'meteoric', 'rise', 'fame', 'much', 'more', 'though', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'being', 'revisited.How', 'then', 'explain', 'Prime', 'Younger', 'second', 'outing', 'Younger', 'wannabe', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Lisa', 'Metzger', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'psychoanalyst', 'who', 'counseling', 'Rafi', 'Gardet', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'messy', 'divorce', 'Rafi', 'up', 'when', 'younger', 'man', 'who', 'fire', 'Rafi', 'Lisa', 'said', 'younger', 'man', 'Lisa', 'son', 'David', 'One', 'Tree', 'Hill', 'Bryan', 'Greenberg', 'Needless', 'say', 'balancing', 'act', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'forever', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'when', 'everyone', 'out', 'everyone', 'else', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'interesting', 'take', 'love', 'triangle', 'instead', 'off', 'rather', 'mediocre', 'adaptation', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'movie', 'script', 'lot', 'time', 'obsessed', 'Lisa', 'family', 'archetypal', 'cases', 'verging', 'stereotypical', 'Jewishness', 'source', 'comedy', 'never', 'really', 'offensive', 'come', 'off', 'cliched', 'now', 'again', 'movie', 'have', 'number', 'funny', 'scenes', 'mostly', 'David', 'interactions', 'grandmother', 'good', 'performances', 'look', 'especially', 'Blood', 'Diamond', 'Ato', 'Essandoh', 'small', 'wonderful', 'role', 'whole', 'never', 'really', 'anything', 'other', 'typical', 'comedy', 'errors', '**']",N/A
962135,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000CS45TC,Robert Moore,"[1, 4]","I have to agree with those reviewers who say that you really don't need to see the movie if you have seen the previews.  This is not one of those films you watch to enjoy character development or see how the director expresses his cinematic craft.  This is one of those films that you watch for one and only one reason:  to see what happens.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with this, but the previews for this film were all over the place and I hate to say that the previews did a great job of distilling the entire movie down to about sixty seconds.  It probably isn't saying something very nice about a film to be able to sum it up in a minute.  So be it.  Let me just say that the perhaps 5% of the key bits in the film that the trailers omit doesn't make the movie worth seeing.Before going on to make a couple of more comments about the film, let me just beef for a second about the current method of doing trailers in Hollywood.  Why do they do it?  Why do they feel compelled to give us about 80% of the plot in a trailer?  It isn't as if there is all that much content to begin with.  What we are given is a relatively enjoyable, light weight film meant to entertain for an hour or two.  But since the story is built around a gimmick, once that gimmick is revealed in the trailer, what is really left?  PRIME isn't by any stretch the only guilty party here, but it is one of the worse.If you have managed to miss the trailer then you might enjoy this film.  No film headed by Uma Thurman and Meryl Streep can be truly dreadful and each does a fine job in their role, as does Bryan Greenberg in the only other important role.  The film was originally to have starred Sandra Bullock, but she left the project when the director/writer wouldn't agree to changes she demanded.  Interestingly Bullock would have been slightly too old for the part (she would have been a 40 year old playing a 37 year old) while Thurman was slightly young for the part (35 playing a 37 year old).  Goldberg and Thurman make a convincing couple and the jokes are adequate, but in the end, there just isn't a whole lot to the film.  And given that most of what the film did have was given away in the previews, watching it can be an unfulfilling experience.  There was one fairly offensive character who didn't seem to place much of an essential role, the best friend of the Goldberg character who never gets beyond the first date with a woman and who always hits them in the face with a cream pie in revenge.  A very unpleasant aspect of the film.  I'm sure the writer saw it as having more significance than it ended up having.So, all in all I can't recommend the film.  There are certainly many worse films and I don't think anyone will actually find it unpleasant.  But just as it doesn't have many vices, neither does it have many virtues, the most Laodicean of films.",3,"If you've seen the trailer, there isn't much need to see the entire film",1142899200,"03 21, 2006",2006,2859,"['have', 'agree', 'reviewers', 'who', 'say', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'see', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'previews', 'not', 'one', 'films', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'character', 'development', 'see', 'how', 'director', 'cinematic', 'craft', 'one', 'films', 'watch', 'one', 'only', 'one', 'reason', 'see', 'what', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'previews', 'film', 'were', 'place', 'hate', 'say', 'previews', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'distilling', 'entire', 'movie', 'down', 'sixty', 'seconds', 'probably', ""n't"", 'saying', 'something', 'very', 'nice', 'film', 'be', 'able', 'sum', 'up', 'minute', 'So', 'be', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'perhaps', '5', '%', 'key', 'bits', 'film', 'trailers', 'omit', ""n't"", 'make', 'movie', 'worth', 'seeing.Before', 'going', 'make', 'couple', 'more', 'comments', 'film', 'let', 'just', 'beef', 'second', 'current', 'method', 'doing', 'trailers', 'Hollywood', 'Why', 'do', 'do', 'Why', 'do', 'feel', 'compelled', 'give', '80', '%', 'plot', 'trailer', ""n't"", 'as', 'that', 'much', 'content', 'begin', 'What', 'are', 'given', 'relatively', 'enjoyable', 'light', 'weight', 'film', 'meant', 'entertain', 'hour', 'two', 'story', 'built', 'gimmick', 'once', 'gimmick', 'revealed', 'trailer', 'what', 'really', 'left', 'PRIME', ""n't"", 'stretch', 'only', 'guilty', 'party', 'here', 'one', 'worse.If', 'have', 'managed', 'miss', 'trailer', 'then', 'might', 'enjoy', 'film', 'film', 'headed', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'can', 'be', 'truly', 'dreadful', 'fine', 'job', 'role', 'Bryan', 'Greenberg', 'only', 'other', 'important', 'role', 'film', 'was', 'originally', 'have', 'starred', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'left', 'project', 'when', 'director/writer', 'would', ""n't"", 'agree', 'changes', 'demanded', 'Interestingly', 'Bullock', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'slightly', 'too', 'old', 'part', 'would', 'have', 'been', '40', 'year', 'old', 'playing', '37', 'year', 'old', 'Thurman', 'was', 'slightly', 'young', 'part', '35', 'playing', '37', 'year', 'old', 'Goldberg', 'Thurman', 'make', 'convincing', 'couple', 'jokes', 'are', 'adequate', 'end', 'just', ""n't"", 'whole', 'lot', 'film', 'given', 'most', 'what', 'film', 'did', 'have', 'was', 'given', 'away', 'previews', 'watching', 'can', 'be', 'unfulfilling', 'experience', 'was', 'one', 'fairly', 'offensive', 'character', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'place', 'much', 'essential', 'role', 'best', 'friend', 'Goldberg', 'character', 'who', 'never', 'first', 'date', 'woman', 'who', 'always', 'face', 'cream', 'pie', 'revenge', 'very', 'unpleasant', 'aspect', 'film', ""'m"", 'sure', 'writer', 'saw', 'having', 'more', 'significance', 'ended', 'up', 'having.So', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'film', 'are', 'certainly', 'many', 'worse', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'will', 'actually', 'find', 'unpleasant', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'many', 'vices', 'neither', 'have', 'many', 'virtues', 'most', 'Laodicean', 'films']",N/A

And Meryl Streep, as David's mom and Rafi's therapist Lisa, proves (once again, as if it were necessary) that she is in the pantheon of Great Actresses with her subtle performance.As with every romantic comedy, there has to be some suspension of disbelief.  The hyper-attractive Thurman and Greenleaf are just too good-looking for words, and yet they are your ""average couple"" in this movie.  There is one hilarious scene that just would be impossible in the real world - David turns down an amorous Rafi's invitation to go to bed in order to play Nintendo.  But in the hands of these actors, the scene still works.In a lesser movie, ""Prime"" would have been laden with too much in the way of Jewish stereotyping.  Indeed, on the written page, Streep's domineering, hypocritical, hyper-Jewish Lisa would be an updated version of Butterfly McQueen.  But instead, in the hands of Streep, Lisa emerges as a wonderfully flawed, loving, conflicted mother.  As a result, the movie's Jewish jokes fall mostly on the side of good taste and big laughs - along the lines of the stereotyping in ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" and ""Kissing Jessica Stein.""A surprisingly good movie (I was prepared to hate it), ""Prime"" can be just what the doctor ordered if you are tired of the ""same old romantic comedy"" and want to see some of the new players in the genre.",4,"Cast elevates ""Prime"" beyond basic plot points",1163980800,"11 20, 2006",2006,1881,"['Prime', 'good', 'movie', 'execution', 'Not', 'nothing', 'are', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'reigning', 'royalty', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'lot', 'craft', 'being', 'so', 'freakishly', 'adorable', 'Prime', 'benefits', 'exquisite', 'casting', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'Rafi', 'perfect', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'choice', 'divorced', '37-year', 'old', 'catch', 'eye', 'young', 'romantic', 'Bryan', 'Greenleaf', 'David', 'overshadowed', 'remarkably', 'good', 'young', 'Jewish', 'artist/stud', 'who', 'Uma', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'David', 'mom', 'Rafi', 'therapist', 'Lisa', 'once', 'again', 'were', 'necessary', 'pantheon', 'Great', 'Actresses', 'subtle', 'performance.As', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'be', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'hyper-attractive', 'Thurman', 'Greenleaf', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'good-looking', 'words', 'yet', 'are', 'average', 'couple', 'movie', 'one', 'hilarious', 'scene', 'just', 'would', 'be', 'impossible', 'real', 'world', 'David', 'down', 'amorous', 'Rafi', 'invitation', 'go', 'bed', 'order', 'play', 'Nintendo', 'hands', 'actors', 'scene', 'still', 'lesser', 'movie', 'Prime', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'laden', 'too', 'much', 'way', 'Jewish', 'stereotyping', 'Indeed', 'written', 'page', 'Streep', 'domineering', 'hypocritical', 'hyper-Jewish', 'Lisa', 'would', 'be', 'updated', 'version', 'Butterfly', 'McQueen', 'instead', 'hands', 'Streep', 'Lisa', 'wonderfully', 'flawed', 'loving', 'conflicted', 'mother', 'result', 'movie', 'Jewish', 'jokes', 'fall', 'mostly', 'side', 'good', 'taste', 'big', 'laughs', 'lines', 'stereotyping', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Greek', 'Wedding', 'Kissing', 'Jessica', 'Stein', 'A', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'movie', 'was', 'prepared', 'hate', 'Prime', 'can', 'be', 'just', 'what', 'doctor', 'ordered', 'are', 'tired', 'same', 'old', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'want', 'see', 'new', 'players', 'genre']",N/A

962143,A268EEWUXYCA8Q,B000CS45TC,Terry Mesnard,"[0, 0]","I'll admit it, when I see a romantic comedy it is usually through a cynical gaze.  I normally get turned off by cliches or the very formulaic pattern they follow.  Normally, I give romantic comedies pretty low reviews because they aren't my bag.  Yet a gem of a movie comes along that makes me smile, laugh or thoroughly enjoy.  My list of enjoyable romantic comedies is very slim but this movie is definitely on the list.Prime is a touching story that follows romantic comedy conventions like most romantic movies do, but its the telling, the acting and the humor that helps set it apart from the crowd.  The plot isn't the most believable, filled with situations that seem too on the nose to be realistic.  For instance, of all the people Uma's character could meet and fall in love with, she finds the son of her therapist?What saves the movie stems from Uma Thurman, Meryl Streep and relative new-comer Bryan Greenberg and a sharp script.  These three actors do a terrific job of providing realistic characters and they are given dialogue that is not only funny but enjoyable and doesn't come across like some movies as being there only to be funny.  In particular, Meryl Streep is quite fine, as usual, and gives us terrific Freudian therapist with enough nervous ticks and eccentricities to keep a smile plastered on my face.  She is terrific.  Her dealing with her son's new found independence is great, and her quandary of dealing with Uma's problems while at the same time realizing she's a mother of Uma's boyfriend brings some funny situations.The relationship between Uma's Rafi and Bryan's David is very interesting and realistic for the most part.  Being around David's age, I could definitely relate to his experiences and his reactions.  And I could definitely see a similar situation occur with a generation gap between two lovers.  It was very interesting and ""realistic"" for a movie.What keeps this from being a truly excellent movie, in my eyes, is the rambling ending.  It takes a long time in the second act to get to a concrete ending.  I'm really glad the movie ended the way it did, I just wish they could have gotten to it a few minutes quicker.I am not the demographic for romantic comedies.  And normally, when I do see a romantic comedy I don't like it and am critical of it.  So it was quite a surprise to enjoy Prime so much.  It is probably the best romantic comedy I have seen in quite a long time.

962144,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000CS45TC,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[1, 1]","Rafi (Uma Thurman, ""Kill Bill"") is working through a painful divorce with her therapist, Dr. Metzger (Meryl Streep). Having just signed the divorce papers, Rafi goes out to a movie, with some friends, and meets David (Bryan Greenberg), a 23 year old struggling painter. David, immediately struck by Rafi's beauty, calls her for a date. Despite her misgivings about the age difference, she falls madly in love. During their sessions, Rafi tells Dr. Metzger all of the intimate details, except she lies about David's age, and Metzger encourages her to go along with the feelings, to have some fun. In another session, Rafi lets David's real age slip and Metzger realizes that Rafi is dating her son. Metzger decides to keep this a secret, no one else knows, so that she can continue treating Rafi. Soon, the `intimate details' begin to bother the therapist and everything comes to a comic conclusion.""Prime"", written and directed by Ben Younger (""Boiler Room"") is a good, but uneven film, trying to do many things at once. At times, it works. At others, it doesn't.In their review, Ebert and Roeper commented that David seemed to be a younger, hipper version of the character Woody Allen plays in so many of his films. The comparison is very appropriate.In Allen's best films, he deftly combines the dramatic and comedic elements of relationship into a rich story exploring the lives of his characters. ""Prime"" is similar to this but it isn't as polished as Allen's best work. It desperately wants to be a more dramatic ""Annie Hall"" but the director can't pull it off.The best part of the film is the depiction of the relationship between Rafi and David. The relationship seems real, as though it is based on a real life relationship. During their dates, when they fight and make-up, as they work through the problems with their relationship, you get the feeling that they are actually in love. This part of the film works well.Metzger is a complicated character. On the one hand, she laments that her son hasn't met a nice Jewish girl and given her a lot of Jewish grandchildren. On the other hand, she happily tells her patient Rafi that she should date a younger man, forget about convention. This bit of Streep's character is amusing and interesting. But when she finds out that Rafi is dating her son, her character becomes more broad and less believable, kvetching about her son this, her son that. This is not one of Meryl Streep's best performances, and it pains me to say that, because I think Streep is a goddess.Uma Thurman is quite good as the confused older woman who falls madly in love with the younger, more romantic David. She manages to convince us that her character is vulnerable, yet strong. I did find it a bit odd that she would meet David on the night she signed her divorce papers and immediately jump into a new relationship with the young man. But once their relationship begins, it is clear that they are both very much in love.Bryan Greenberg is good. He is entirely convincing as the young artist; attentive and romantic, he also has his moments where he feels confined and restricted. His problems dealing with his more religious Jewish family are interesting and, at times, amusing. Again, these moments make him seem all the more like a younger, more assured version of Woody Allen's character.My biggest problem with ""Prime"" is that the film interjects moments of broad comedy into a film that is desperately trying to be a more serious romantic comedy/ drama. For every scene of David taking Rafi to his work, to eat take-out in front of a real Mark Rothko painting that she loves, we get a scene of Streep's Metzger lying on a couch hyperventilating because she knows things about her patient and son that she isn't supposed to know. For every scene of David and Rafi at a party with her co-workers, as David deals with the new element, we get a scene of  David's best friend throwing another cream pie into the face of a woman who he went on one date with. The two elements just don't mesh well enough. The key to Allen's best films is that the two elements were usually separated, if not by characters, by scene. One scene would deal with two characters in a serious way, the next would feature Allen and one of his co-stars in a funny situation. In ""Prime"", all three main characters are involved in both the funny and dramatic, requiring the two parts of the story to be equally absorbing and equally successful. They aren't.The trailer really does a disservice to ""Prime"". It makes the film seem funnier than it actually is, downplaying the romantic and dramatic elements. It also ruins the big surprise in the film, the one moment that all of the comedy is based on. Not a great move.""Prime"" is a mixed effort with good points and bad.

If not, catch the DVD.",3,Good Woody Allen- Lite,1131408000,"11 8, 2005",2005,4866,"['Rafi', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'working', 'painful', 'divorce', 'therapist', 'Dr.', 'Metzger', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Having', 'just', 'signed', 'divorce', 'papers', 'Rafi', 'out', 'movie', 'friends', 'meets', 'David', 'Bryan', 'Greenberg', '23', 'year', 'old', 'struggling', 'painter', 'David', 'immediately', 'struck', 'Rafi', 'beauty', 'date', 'misgivings', 'age', 'difference', 'madly', 'love', 'sessions', 'Rafi', 'Dr.', 'Metzger', 'intimate', 'details', 'David', 'age', 'Metzger', 'go', 'along', 'feelings', 'have', 'fun', 'session', 'Rafi', 'David', 'real', 'age', 'slip', 'Metzger', 'Rafi', 'dating', 'son', 'Metzger', 'keep', 'secret', 'one', 'else', 'can', 'continue', 'treating', 'Rafi', 'Soon', 'intimate', 'details', 'begin', 'bother', 'therapist', 'everything', 'comic', 'conclusion', 'Prime', 'written', 'directed', 'Ben', 'Younger', 'Boiler', 'Room', 'good', 'uneven', 'film', 'trying', 'do', 'many', 'things', 'once', 'times', 'others', ""doesn't.In"", 'review', 'Ebert', 'Roeper', 'commented', 'David', 'seemed', 'be', 'younger', 'hipper', 'version', 'character', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'comparison', 'very', 'appropriate.In', 'Allen', 'best', 'films', 'deftly', 'dramatic', 'comedic', 'elements', 'relationship', 'rich', 'story', 'exploring', 'lives', 'characters', 'Prime', 'similar', ""n't"", 'as', 'polished', 'Allen', 'best', 'work', 'desperately', 'be', 'more', 'dramatic', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'director', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pull', 'off.The', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'depiction', 'relationship', 'Rafi', 'David', 'relationship', 'real', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'relationship', 'dates', 'when', 'fight', 'make-up', 'work', 'problems', 'relationship', 'get', 'feeling', 'are', 'actually', 'love', 'part', 'film', 'well.Metzger', 'complicated', 'character', 'one', 'hand', 'son', ""n't"", 'met', 'nice', 'Jewish', 'girl', 'given', 'lot', 'Jewish', 'grandchildren', 'other', 'hand', 'happily', 'patient', 'Rafi', 'should', 'date', 'younger', 'man', 'forget', 'convention', 'bit', 'Streep', 'character', 'amusing', 'interesting', 'when', 'out', 'Rafi', 'dating', 'son', 'character', 'more', 'broad', 'less', 'believable', 'kvetching', 'son', 'son', 'not', 'one', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'best', 'performances', 'say', 'think', 'Streep', 'goddess.Uma', 'Thurman', 'quite', 'good', 'confused', 'older', 'woman', 'who', 'madly', 'love', 'younger', 'more', 'romantic', 'David', 'convince', 'character', 'vulnerable', 'yet', 'strong', 'did', 'find', 'bit', 'odd', 'would', 'meet', 'David', 'night', 'signed', 'divorce', 'papers', 'immediately', 'jump', 'new', 'relationship', 'young', 'man', 'once', 'relationship', 'clear', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'love.Bryan', 'Greenberg', 'good', 'entirely', 'convincing', 'young', 'artist', 'attentive', 'romantic', 'also', 'moments', 'where', 'confined', 'restricted', 'problems', 'dealing', 'more', 'religious', 'Jewish', 'family', 'are', 'interesting', 'times', 'amusing', 'Again', 'moments', 'make', 'seem', 'more', 'younger', 'more', 'assured', 'version', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'character.My', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Prime', 'film', 'moments', 'broad', 'comedy', 'film', 'desperately', 'trying', 'be', 'more', 'serious', 'romantic', 'comedy/', 'drama', 'scene', 'David', 'taking', 'Rafi', 'work', 'eat', 'take-out', 'front', 'real', 'Mark', 'Rothko', 'painting', 'get', 'scene', 'Streep', 'Metzger', 'lying', 'couch', 'hyperventilating', 'things', 'patient', 'son', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'know', 'scene', 'David', 'Rafi', 'party', 'co-workers', 'David', 'deals', 'new', 'element', 'get', 'scene', 'David', 'best', 'friend', 'throwing', 'cream', 'pie', 'face', 'woman', 'who', 'went', 'one', 'date', 'two', 'elements', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'mesh', 'well', 'enough', 'key', 'Allen', 'best', 'films', 'two', 'elements', 'were', 'usually', 'separated', 'not', 'characters', 'scene', 'One', 'scene', 'would', 'deal', 'two', 'characters', 'serious', 'way', 'next', 'would', 'feature', 'Allen', 'one', 'co-stars', 'funny', 'situation', 'Prime', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'involved', 'funny', 'dramatic', 'requiring', 'two', 'parts', 'story', 'be', 'equally', 'absorbing', 'equally', 'successful', ""aren't.The"", 'trailer', 'really', 'disservice', 'Prime', 'film', 'seem', 'funnier', 'actually', 'downplaying', 'romantic', 'dramatic', 'elements', 'also', 'big', 'surprise', 'film', 'one', 'moment', 'comedy', 'based', 'Not', 'great', 'move', 'Prime', 'mixed', 'effort', 'good', 'points', 'bad', 'like', 'one', 'two', 'lead', 'actresses', 'catch', 'bargain', 'matinee', 'not', 'catch', 'DVD']",N/A

The pies in the face routines were an off note in this often-thoughtful film.",3,I don't know why I didn't like this more than I did,1170547200,"02 4, 2007",2007,620,"['should', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'film', 'was', 'only', 'good', 'Meryl', 'true', 'can', 'do', 'wrong', 'Uma', 'did', 'excellent', 'work', 'did', 'Bryan', 'writing', 'was', 'excellent', 'particularly', 'regarding', 'issues', 'age', 'clashing', 'cultures', 'etc', 'Meryl', 'played', 'Jewish', 'therapist', 'mother', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'stereotypical', 'capable', 'hands', 'was', ""n't"", 'were', 'sitcom', 'elements', 'such', 'nebbishy', 'best', 'friend', 'leading', 'man', 'someone', 'who', 'more', 'involved', 'throwing', 'custard', 'pies', 'exploring', 'failed', 'relationships', 'pies', 'face', 'routines', 'were', 'off', 'note', 'often-thoughtful', 'film']",N/A

962149,A2CDMCG1Z84A51,B000CS45TC,Wanda B. Red,"[1, 1]","This is a film with an inherently promising and funny premise -- Rafi, a recently divorced 37-year-old woman, unknowingly begins dating her therapist's 23-year-old son, David, and spills all to the embarrassed therapist who conceals her son's identity to preserve the therapeutic relationship. It then milks that premise for all it's worth, which, given the talent of stars Uma Thurman (as Rafi) and Meryl Streep (as Lisa Metzger, the therapist), is a fair return. Uma Thurman is so gorgeous, vulnerable, and well dressed that it is a real treat to watch her play this age-appropriate part, especially for a (ahem, not so young) woman like myself. Meryl Streep as usual shows her ability to mimic broad features of a role (accents, gestures, etc.), though I did not find her emotionally convincing as the therapist.The problem with the film begins when there is nothing more to be reaped from the comic premise, and the movie must figure out how to come to a close. A series of overwrought breakings and makings-up ensue, until the obligatory 90+ (actually 106) minutes have been reached, and we can have a pious and tender epilogue between the two main characters (I won't spoil the movie more than that) with fake snow falling and soft music playing.In general, this film reaches for broad effects. Like the cream pies with which David's friend Morris endlessly assaults girls who won't give him a second date, it's a cream-puff in the viewer's face. It tastes pretty good, but you'll want to go wash it off later.",3,Funny enough,1146873600,"05 6, 2006",2006,1516,"['film', 'inherently', 'promising', 'funny', 'premise', 'Rafi', 'recently', 'divorced', '37-year-old', 'woman', 'unknowingly', 'dating', 'therapist', '23-year-old', 'son', 'David', 'embarrassed', 'therapist', 'who', 'son', 'identity', 'preserve', 'therapeutic', 'relationship', 'then', 'premise', 'worth', 'given', 'talent', 'stars', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'Rafi', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Lisa', 'Metzger', 'therapist', 'fair', 'return', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'so', 'gorgeous', 'vulnerable', 'well', 'dressed', 'real', 'treat', 'watch', 'play', 'age-appropriate', 'part', 'especially', 'ahem', 'not', 'so', 'young', 'woman', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'usual', 'ability', 'mimic', 'broad', 'features', 'role', 'accents', 'gestures', 'etc', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'emotionally', 'convincing', 'therapist.The', 'problem', 'film', 'when', 'nothing', 'more', 'be', 'reaped', 'comic', 'premise', 'movie', 'must', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'come', 'close', 'series', 'overwrought', 'breakings', 'makings-up', 'ensue', 'obligatory', '90+', 'actually', '106', 'minutes', 'have', 'been', 'reached', 'can', 'have', 'pious', 'tender', 'epilogue', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'movie', 'more', 'fake', 'snow', 'falling', 'soft', 'music', 'playing.In', 'general', 'film', 'broad', 'effects', 'cream', 'pies', 'David', 'friend', 'Morris', 'endlessly', 'girls', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'second', 'date', 'cream-puff', 'viewer', 'face', 'pretty', 'good', ""'ll"", 'want', 'go', 'wash', 'off', 'later']",N/A
962150,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B000CS45TC,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[35, 40]","A comedy of errors and age differences, ""Prime"" (referring to a man and woman's sexual prime which are at different ages) is a clever film that didn't play well in theaters. Perhaps it got lost in the glut of holiday event movies or the lack of buzz because that's too bad. While it isn't a great romantic comedy it has charm and a great comedic performance from Meryl Streep as well as appealing performances (and chemistry)from Uma Thurman and Bryan Greenberg.Rafi (Uma Thurman)is mired in a messy divorce that's taken all of the joy out of her life. Until she meets David (Bryan Greenberg)a man 14 years her junior living with his grandparents. Her therapist Lisa Metzger (Meryl Streep)is pleased for her until she realizes that the stories that Rafi's been relating about her new love is about her son. While the film does occasionally steer into sitcom territory the appealing cast and performances keep the film on course most of the time.""Prime"" looks very nice in this widescreen transfer. For those who hated widescreen there's also a separate full screen release available as well. The special features are quite limited and could be better. While we get a decent commentary track from the director and producer, I'd rather hear the cast talk about their characters and in particular hear about the experience of Thurman and Greenberg working together in this romantic comedy with Streep. We get a standard ""making of"" featurette where the director discusses his inspiration (one of those hit-by-lightning moments when he wondered what it would be like if the girl he was dating was seeing his mother a therapist and neither one knew about the other). This romantic comedy certainly deserved more inspired featurettes--what about one on the trials and tribulations of women dating younger men?While the film isn't perfect it's entertaining and has a marvelous comedic performance from Streep as well as great chemistry between Thurman and Greenberg on screen.
