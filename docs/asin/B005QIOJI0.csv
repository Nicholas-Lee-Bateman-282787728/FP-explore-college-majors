The film is more comparable to the first season, when the plot was still at its freshest. The club, who faces scrutiny from many angles, mostly fellow students, maneuver metaphorical muddy waters in a brightly colored and suitably vibrant boat of, well, glee. The music has always been one of the highlights with the series and the film runs with this idea, incorporating some songs we all know and love, while introducing us to those we might have never heard before. There hasn't been a whole lot of films of this ilk, so while this type of film is in the spotlight, it should be appreciated for what it is, added to a collection, and cherished for as long as we entertain ourselves through television.

1497477,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B005QIOJI0,California Dreaming,"[0, 0]","I started watching ""Glee"" in probably the second season.  After I watched a couple of episodes, I believe that I went back and saw the episodes from Season One that I missed.  While I'm surely not the target audience for this teeny-bopper-targeted material, I still really like the show.  Sue Sylvester kills me.  And Brittany S. Pears is hilarious, reminding me of Lisa Kudrow on ""Friends.""  And of course, Lea Michelle is an awesome singer, giving Barbara Streisand a run for her money.  And the rest of the cast is very good as well.While this film's a little ""weepy"" -- they bring in fans between songs for real-life interviews, where some of those fans have been treated poorly and overcome it, a general theme of ""Glee"" -- it didn't water the movie down much for me.  I wasn't crying like the little girls up front, the girls who wanted to be the next Lea Michelle, but it was still touching without being over-the-top sappy.  There is one scene that was memorable:  a little Warbler wannabe -- he is no more than four years old tops -- is all dressed up in the Warbler gear, he's singing and he's dancing in front of his TV while the Warblers are performing behind him.  I was howling, and I'm sure that Blaine got a kick out of it as well.With regards to the music, if you've watched the television series, you've heard most of the songs.  Most of them are recycled from various episodes, spiced up a bit with some nice choreography, particularly great dancing by Ms. Pears.  But even still, it's nice to see that the singers on the show are really good, as you're never quite sure how good they are while watching on TV.  ""How much overdubbing did they do?"" is what I usually think.  Well here, while there's surely mixing going on, it's pretty much them singing live.More like really a 3, but I'll round up to a 4 today since I'm in a good mood.

Only in the process, actual performances were cut short or cut out altogether. The editing on some of the performances themselves was badly done as well. There was a whole jitterbug performance by Britney that was ruined due to bad camera work and editing.Based on some other 3D live performances I have viewed, I found that less is more. Fast cutting and insane camera moves only help to pull you out of the feeling of actually being among the audience. I love get bird's eye views, but not if the camera is literally swooping on stage and past the actual performances.The extra features included a bunch of intros to performances by Sue Sylvester that were disconnected that if actually part of the presentation, would have made more sense and made the show feel like a complete package.And where was Mr. Schuester?!

I actually would have preferred the actors to be themselves and not the characters but it works okay what they did. I also would have preferred their in character behind stage acting pieces to have been separate to the concert but I can live with them on there. What lessens the replaying this over and over again factor though is the stupid fan comments and documentaries where some guy wishes Glee was on when he was back at school when his diary got passed around the school, that inside he had written about how much he liked some other guy, so he wouldn't have had to quit the school.  Or a cheerleader with dwarfism who wants to become homecoming queen and is ecstatic that a football player asks her to the dance, including the re-enactment of him asking her done like a wedding proposal.  These documentaries and I'm the biggest fan of insert favourite character here nonsense, really should have been hidden away as a special feature where if you're interested you can watch them, or at the very least there should be an option in the menu to watch concert only, or watch concert with fan documentaries and comments.The on stage performances are really well done though, I imagine it would pretty daunting to sing in front of a massive crowd when in the case of most of them you're usually just an actor and haven't played music to small crowds, which get bigger as you get more popular eventually filling stadiums throughout your career. Plus all the choreography they would have to learn, is performed really well.  I would have liked to have seen Mr Schue (Matthew Morrison) do a song though, since he is the most talented male singer on the show. If they could get Gwyneth Paltrow to do a cameo performance (and she does do a good job) for the DVD, surely Matthew Morrison could have committed to come out for a one off song for the DVD as well even if he couldn't commit to the concerts and the rigorous training involved.But the biggest thing that lets this down is the fan comments and documentaries being interwoven into the concert.

I want to see the concert, not all these kids saying how meaningful Glee is to them. I don't care about them, and didn't pay $13 at the movies to hear their stories. I wanted to see the ACTUAL concert, without any dumb interruptions.What bothered me the most was they overlapped these kids videos over performances in the concert, most noticeably in ""Happy Days/ Are Here Again"" (when they cut out the best part of the song - Chris Colfer singing) and in ""Lucky"" with Dianna and Chord.Moreover, I can't believe they didn't include Chris Colfer's ""Single Ladies"" dance! I thought the least they could do is include it on the DVD but nope! They didn't. Which was by the way, the BEST part of the concert (a part from the Warblers performance)It's weird how they asked Jane Lynch to go to the NY show and they put her in the trailer but never show her in the movie.

I even put the digital copy on my computer and we can now watch it anytime using the home-sharing feature on our Apple TV unit. The concert itself was and is fabulous. The surprising thing is that the actors tour not as themselves, but as their characters and they stay in charater throughout the concert and even during the backstage, behind-the-scenes footage. This is a great idea because it keeps it all within the context of the GLEE television show and it keeps Lea, Corey, Mark, Darren and Chris's egos out of the mix!

I DID go with a friend to see the film in the theatre and we both LOVED it.  I think the studio waited too long to make this.  Glee after the first season became very formulaic - there was simply nowhere for the story line to go: glee club geeks can't get no respect from other students, other teachers and the powers that be - and evil Sue Sylvester wants them destroyed.  Okay, we got it!  As much as I loved the first season, I stopped watching a few episodes into Season 2.  The novelty was gone and there was not much room for growth.This movie however, took me back to that dazzling first season - with JUST the music and the enthusiasm.  I loved the performances and I did enjoy the fan interviews.  My friend and I actually got up and danced along in the theatre as we watched this.My non-Glee friends and I have had many discussions about the pros and cons of Glee. My stance has always been that if the show makes some kid go out and buy a Queen album or a Judy Garland album, or a John Lennon album, or a Beatles album, etc, that would the best of all results.  I mean, my pals and I had no idea who Muddy Waters or Howling Wolf were until The Stones and Yardbirds introduced them to us.I enjoyed the film IMMENSELY and it has now become my favorite workout dvd - I mean, you cannot sit still while watching this.So, to you humbugs out there, lighten up!

1497513,A1SF7RT2UNXW37,B005QIOJI0,Tinnean,"[3, 5]","I read a review of this DVD and was thrilled to see all the musical numbers that were going to be in it. I wasn't prepared to pay the full price for it, but the day it was released, Target had it on sale for $14.99. Plus, using my Target card got me an additional 5% off. Believe me, this is the only reason I'm not cutting my throat right now.What an waste of money. Apparently, this is not the entire concert. (I've pissed and moaned about this in comments, but I'd really wanted Single Ladies, and it wasn't included.)Also, was there a reason for the inclusion of all the fan comments on how Glee impacted their lives? I'm sure their families and friends are thrilled out of their minds, but if I'd wanted to see vingnettes like these, I'd have watched It Gets Better vids on YouTube (which are so much better.)As for the 'exclusive content' that's to be delivered 'right to my mobile device', I don't go that route, and it was another waste.This is the second time Ryan Murphy has done this to me. I was extremely disappointed in Glee Encore, and I'm even more disappointed in this.At one point I had Glee Season 2 on my Amazon Wish List. After watching the Concert Movie, I deleted it.

1497515,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B005QIOJI0,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[19, 29]","It's important to understand up front that Glee: The 3D Concert Movie is really just for fans of the TV show. Anyone else will either find it just mildly entertaining or else be left wondering what the fuss is all about. A good example of this can be seen in interviews with various fans waiting to get into the concert. A number of them are wearing white T-shirts with different words and phrases printed on them in block letters. Anyone who hasn't seen the ""Born This Way"" episode of the TV show isn't going to get the context. Particularly of the shirts bearing the word ""Lebanese"".The best parts of the show are in fact the ones dealing with the fans, both in the brief interviews with the fans waiting to get into the concert and with the in-depth interviews of four fans in particular: Janae, a high school cheerleader who's also a ""little person""; Trenton, a gay teen who was outed in the 8th grade; Josey, a girl who's the ultimate Glee fan who also has mild Asperger's; and Kellen Sarmiento, a pint-sized 5-year-old Filipino boy in a Warbler uniform who mimics Blaine's music moves. All of these people are fascinating to listen to, or in the case of ""the Mini-Warbler"" as he's now generally referred to, cute to watch.But this is a concert film, and I'm afraid here even fans of the show may be somewhat disappointed. As my wife remarked afterwards, most of the numbers in the concert weren't done as well as they were in the TV show. The actual music numbers are a mixed bag. Most, like ""Don't Stop Believin'"", ""The Safety Dance"" and ""Somebody to Love"", are ones already familiar to fans from the TV show, but unfortunately not done as well as they were in the TV show (which admittedly is always a challenge in a concert film where you can't do multiple takes). A few numbers do stand out though. Brittany (Heather Morris) definitely turns up the heat a notch in ""I'm a Slave 4 U"", and Puck (Mark Salling) really revs up the crowd with his guitar-accompanied rendition of ""Fat Bottomed Girls"". I'm sure everyone will have their own favorites - already had one comment from a Santana (Naya Rivera) fan who really liked Santana's ""Valerie"" - but these were the ones that stood out for me.Mercedes (Amber Riley) comes through with her usual gusto and clarity but her numbers unfortunately aren't that memorable. The same for Rachel (Lea Michele) who almost makes it with her rendition of ""Don't Rain on my Parade"" but the arrangement fails to make the best use of her marvelous voice. She did however have one of the funnier backstage bits where, before she goes on, someone tells her that Barbra Streisand is in the audience and she proceeds to panic and gush about how she always knew this day would come! Mike Chang (Harry Shum, Jr) has a nice bit where he does his ""Robot Chang"" routine, but otherwise it's clear that he's really a dancer (a really good dancer, to be fair) and not a singer.The rest of the cast are there and most have numbers but don't really make much of an impact. Artie (Kevin McHale) spends a lot of his backstage time apparently trying to do a Justin Bieber impression. The Warblers numbers seemed uninspired and went on way too long. But the biggest (and strangest) disappointment was Kurt (Chris Colfer) who seemed more comfortable in the background singing back-up than when he was doing a duet or solo number, where he seemed almost detached and lacking his usual flamboyance and panache. He also seemed to have the least to say in the parts where the camera goes backstage. I've been told though that the DVD/Blu-ray release will include a couple of numbers and scenes with him that were left out of the movie itself as extras.I think the key problem is that what Glee fans love about the TV show are the characters, and most of the songs in the TV show take on a special meaning because of the context they appear in, relating to the events in each episode's storyline and the lives and feelings of the characters we have gotten to know. But in the concert, all of that context is largely missing. There's no real story (other than the conceit that we're seeing the characters in concert and not the actors who play them) and little if any interaction between the characters, and so the songs lose the context they had in the TV episodes.As for the 3D part, as it is with most 3D movies of the last few years, there was _no_ reason to make this a 3D movie. The only part of the film where the 3D has anything to offer is during the credits when the screen is bombarded with CGI slushies. It's definitely a nice touch, but doesn't justify the use of 3D for the entire film.Strangely, Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch), who can be seen snarling in a couple of remarkably funny bits in the movie trailers, was not in the concert film itself. She will however be showing up on the DVD/Blu-ray when it comes out. Also strangely, occasional substitute teacher Holly Holiday (Gwyneth Paltrow) makes an appearance in the film but series regular Will Shuester (Matthew Morrison) does not. I particularly missed Mr. Shue as Morrison puts enormous energy and feeling into his performances in the TV show and is just a lot of fun to watch.Recommended mainly for for Glee fans, particularly those who like to hear other Glee fans tell their stories, and for fans of Brittany and Puck in particular for their stand-out numbers.",3,"Strictly for Glee fans, but has some very nice fan
