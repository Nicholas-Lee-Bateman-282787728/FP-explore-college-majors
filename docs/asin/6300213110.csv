207677,A2PBGXYTV47RCW,6300213110,"Amazon Customer ""sukhisoo""","[2, 2]",This episode is a classic. The first half of the episode is a humorous look at the suppressed desires of several minor characters as a result of a &quot;space virus&quot; that gradually begins to affect the entire crew. Sulu's jaunt as a swordsman-wannabe is especially fun. O'Reilly's personal delusion as a descendent of Irish kings is also fun and becomes very dangerous as the episode progresses.The episode gets even better in the second half as more and more of the crew becomes infected and the Enterprise gets caught in an irreversibly(?) decaying orbit. A definite nail-biter!!,5,Humorous and Suspenseful -- A Classic,986774400,"04 9, 2001",2001,586,"['episode', 'classic', 'first', 'half', 'episode', 'humorous', 'look', 'suppressed', 'desires', 'several', 'minor', 'characters', 'result', 'quot', 'space', 'virus', 'quot', 'gradually', 'affect', 'entire', 'crew', 'Sulu', 'jaunt', 'swordsman-wannabe', 'especially', 'fun', ""O'Reilly"", 'personal', 'delusion', 'descendent', 'Irish', 'kings', 'also', 'fun', 'very', 'dangerous', 'episode', 'progresses.The', 'episode', 'even', 'better', 'second', 'half', 'more', 'more', 'crew', 'infected', 'Enterprise', 'caught', 'irreversibly', 'decaying', 'orbit', 'definite', 'nail-biter']",N/A
207678,A1S3C5OFU508P3,6300213110,Charles Ashbacher,"[0, 0]","This remains one of my all-time favorite episodes of the original series. In my mind, it truly established the series as a new and dynamic show unlike any that had come before. It also demonstrates how fragile our socializing self control can be, as the crew of the Enterprise, some of the most psychologically stable people in the Federation, easily lose control of their inhibitions.The Enterprise is sent to recover a science team on Psi 2000 before the planet self-destructs. When Spock and a crewman beam down, they find a bizarre set of circumstances, as everyone in the team is dead. Some froze to death due to the voluntary shutting of off the life support and one person was frozen while taking a shower fully clothed.Even though the recovery team is decontaminated upon return, one has been infected with a very contagious disease, the same one that caused the death of the science team. It soon appears among the crew, infecting nearly everyone. The best scenes are when Zulu grabs a fencing foil and runs through the Enterprise playing the role of a swashbuckling swordsman. It is unfortunate that later episodes could not exploit the acting talents of George Takei like this one did. Dr. McCoy is able to synthesize a cure in the ""nick of time"" and the Enterprise is able to pull out of orbit at the last moment by an emergency and dangerous restart of the engines that throws them back in time.This episode not only introduces some of the physiological differences between Vulcans and humans, it also presents the first time when Scotty ""breaks the laws of physics."" It sets the stage for future episodes where time travel is performed and the actors are allowed to express emotions, as even Spock cries.",5,"One of the best episodes in the series, it introduced many plot devices that were used later",1211328000,"05 21, 2008",2008,1718,"['one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'original', 'series', 'mind', 'truly', 'established', 'series', 'new', 'dynamic', 'show', 'had', 'come', 'before', 'also', 'how', 'fragile', 'socializing', 'control', 'can', 'be', 'crew', 'Enterprise', 'most', 'psychologically', 'stable', 'people', 'Federation', 'easily', 'lose', 'control', 'inhibitions.The', 'Enterprise', 'sent', 'recover', 'science', 'team', 'Psi', '2000', 'planet', 'self-destructs', 'When', 'Spock', 'crewman', 'beam', 'down', 'find', 'bizarre', 'set', 'circumstances', 'everyone', 'team', 'dead', 'froze', 'death', 'due', 'voluntary', 'shutting', 'life', 'support', 'one', 'person', 'was', 'frozen', 'taking', 'shower', 'fully', 'clothed.Even', 'recovery', 'team', 'decontaminated', 'return', 'one', 'been', 'infected', 'very', 'contagious', 'disease', 'same', 'one', 'caused', 'death', 'science', 'team', 'soon', 'crew', 'infecting', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'best', 'scenes', 'are', 'when', 'Zulu', 'fencing', 'foil', 'Enterprise', 'playing', 'role', 'swashbuckling', 'swordsman', 'unfortunate', 'later', 'episodes', 'could', 'not', 'exploit', 'acting', 'talents', 'George', 'Takei', 'one', 'did', 'Dr.', 'McCoy', 'able', 'synthesize', 'cure', 'nick', 'time', 'Enterprise', 'able', 'pull', 'orbit', 'last', 'moment', 'emergency', 'dangerous', 'restart', 'engines', 'back', 'time.This', 'episode', 'not', 'only', 'physiological', 'differences', 'Vulcans', 'humans', 'also', 'first', 'time', 'when', 'Scotty', 'laws', 'physics', 'stage', 'future', 'episodes', 'where', 'time', 'travel', 'performed', 'actors', 'are', 'allowed', 'express', 'emotions', 'even', 'Spock', 'cries']",N/A

Also, why did they try to do so much character development in one of the beginning episodes?  This should have been attempted late in the first season because they character were still getting used to each other.  There was almost no chemistry between the actors in this episode.Also, it was said that the virus spread through perspiration.

207681,A3U56M0Y8LYO6J,6300213110,"Steven Y. ""Pop Culture Addict""","[1, 1]","""The Naked Time"" is an episode with many layers of meaning.  It could be a metaphor for alcoholism.  Or it could be a cautionary tale on the dangers of biological contaminants.  Or it could be a 23rd century representation of the long-standing problem of cabin fever aboard a ship on an extended mission.  Or if you simply do not want to analyze it that deeply, it simply is that corny episode where Sulu (George Takei) runs around the ship shirtless and Spock (Leonard Nimoy) weeps like a baby.Spock and crewman Joe Tormolen (Stewart Moss) transport to planet Psi 2000 and discover that its research staff has perished.  It turns out that a virus was the cause of the deaths but by the time the Enterprise crew discovers this, Tormolen has already brought it back to the ship.  One crew member after another becomes infected until Doctor Leonard McCoy (DeForest Kelley) discovers an antidote in time to save the ship from being destroyed.""The Naked Time"" provided many memorable moments that one can vividly recall to this day - Sulu with the fencing sword, Nurse Christine Chapel (Majel Barrett) professing her love for Spock, Spock breaking down, and Lt.  Kevin Riley (Bruce Hyde) anointing himself captain of the Enterprise.  All of this seems silly if you really think about it but the episode still is intriguing for providing valuable insights into the hidden aspects of the crew.  Because of the Psi 2000 virus, we now know of Sulu's craving for adventure, Chapel's crush on the Vulcan first officer, and Spock's ongoing struggle to maintain his control over his emotions.  Once again attention to character development helps to add more substance to the series.",3,"""I'm in love with you, Mr. Spock.""",1069200000,"11 19, 2003",2003,1670,"['Naked', 'Time', 'episode', 'many', 'layers', 'meaning', 'could', 'be', 'metaphor', 'alcoholism', 'could', 'be', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'dangers', 'biological', 'contaminants', 'could', 'be', '23rd', 'century', 'representation', 'long-standing', 'problem', 'cabin', 'fever', 'ship', 'extended', 'mission', 'simply', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'analyze', 'deeply', 'simply', 'corny', 'episode', 'where', 'Sulu', 'George', 'Takei', 'ship', 'shirtless', 'Spock', 'Leonard', 'Nimoy', 'weeps', 'baby.Spock', 'crewman', 'Joe', 'Tormolen', 'Stewart', 'Moss', 'transport', 'planet', 'Psi', '2000', 'discover', 'research', 'staff', 'perished', 'out', 'virus', 'was', 'cause', 'deaths', 'time', 'Enterprise', 'crew', 'Tormolen', 'already', 'brought', 'back', 'ship', 'One', 'crew', 'member', 'becomes', 'infected', 'Doctor', 'Leonard', 'McCoy', 'DeForest', 'Kelley', 'antidote', 'time', 'save', 'ship', 'being', 'destroyed', 'Naked', 'Time', 'provided', 'many', 'memorable', 'moments', 'one', 'can', 'vividly', 'recall', 'day', 'Sulu', 'fencing', 'sword', 'Nurse', 'Christine', 'Chapel', 'Majel', 'Barrett', 'professing', 'love', 'Spock', 'Spock', 'breaking', 'down', 'Lt.', 'Kevin', 'Riley', 'Bruce', 'Hyde', 'anointing', 'captain', 'Enterprise', 'silly', 'really', 'think', 'episode', 'still', 'intriguing', 'providing', 'valuable', 'insights', 'hidden', 'aspects', 'crew', 'Psi', '2000', 'virus', 'now', 'know', 'Sulu', 'craving', 'adventure', 'Chapel', 'crush', 'Vulcan', 'first', 'officer', 'Spock', 'ongoing', 'struggle', 'maintain', 'control', 'emotions', 'Once', 'again', 'attention', 'character', 'development', 'add', 'more', 'substance', 'series']",N/A
