He doesn't know where it came from, only that it is new and not yet illegal.  But the drug was originally destroyed by the Church for a reason as the idiot's roommate finds out by accident.  The drug causes some users to thirst for blood and become animalistic.  It was the origin of the vampire myths.  Now a Berkeley student rediscovered it and lost control of it.Once the danger is known, the roommate tries to tell the idiot but he refuses to listen.  Eventually the party occurs and the drug is passed out.  It then becomes a battle of survival for those who did not take the drug.  On the one hand, the people trying to kill them will stop once the drug wears off.  On the other hand, killing them first seems the best defense.  Can they be trapped or tied up?  Is there any escape?  Watch and find out.This one was better than I expected.  I read a lot of bad reviews after I saw an intriguing trailer.  Now I am glad I decided to check it out.  Not a bad little story.  Although vampire legends go back three-thousand years this plot gives a nice take on the whole idea even if it really doesn't work.  The acting is what you would expect for the quality.  Our main character (the girl on the cover with the amazing nose) goes through some interesting soul searching and moral dilemmas that are usually missing in this type of film.  All in all it is not great but it is good and worth a watch.  Check it out.",3,Don't Do Gypsy Drugs,1168473600,"01 11, 2007",2007,1532,"['ancient', 'Gypsy', 'drug', 'resurfaced', 'hands', 'idiot', 'pass', 'out', 'secret', 'party', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'came', 'only', 'new', 'not', 'yet', 'illegal', 'drug', 'was', 'originally', 'destroyed', 'Church', 'reason', 'idiot', 'roommate', 'out', 'accident', 'drug', 'users', 'thirst', 'blood', 'become', 'animalistic', 'was', 'origin', 'vampire', 'myths', 'Now', 'Berkeley', 'student', 'rediscovered', 'lost', 'control', 'it.Once', 'danger', 'known', 'roommate', 'tries', 'tell', 'idiot', 'listen', 'Eventually', 'party', 'occurs', 'drug', 'passed', 'out', 'then', 'battle', 'survival', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'take', 'drug', 'one', 'hand', 'people', 'trying', 'kill', 'will', 'stop', 'once', 'drug', 'off', 'other', 'hand', 'killing', 'first', 'best', 'defense', 'Can', 'be', 'trapped', 'tied', 'up', 'there', 'escape', 'Watch', 'find', 'out.This', 'one', 'was', 'better', 'expected', 'read', 'lot', 'bad', 'reviews', 'saw', 'intriguing', 'trailer', 'Now', 'am', 'glad', 'decided', 'check', 'out', 'Not', 'bad', 'little', 'story', 'vampire', 'legends', 'go', 'back', 'three-thousand', 'years', 'plot', 'nice', 'take', 'whole', 'idea', 'even', 'really', ""n't"", 'work', 'acting', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'quality', 'main', 'character', 'girl', 'cover', 'amazing', 'nose', 'interesting', 'soul', 'searching', 'moral', 'dilemmas', 'are', 'usually', 'missing', 'type', 'film', 'not', 'great', 'good', 'worth', 'watch', 'Check', 'out']",Side FX
878489,A1XKFAUI3GWD3M,B0007989VQ,Kevin Moore,"[1, 3]",I normally like even bad vampire movies.  But this isn't one.  Just a movie about a drug that makes people go mad and think they need to drink blood.  Of course everyone wants to create a drug with that as a side effect!I didn't mind the acting of about 3 of the characters.  The rest were beginners.  Too often use of the fog machine. Had to have the typical required sex scenes but they were very subtle.Don't view it unless it is the only movie you have to pick from.

As it is distibuted to unsuspecting users, unintended consequences abound. The entire concept of a designer drug wreaking havoc has not been extensively played out and so this makes the theme somewhat fresh. Obviously the low-budget of this film created constraints that are fairly obvious, but the acceptable thespian skills of main players made the story at least watchable... which is more than I can say for many subpar horror dogs like ""Fate"" ""Decoys"" and their ilk.",3,"intriguing premise, mediocre acting and execution",1127088000,"09 19, 2005",2005,568,"['plot', 'around', 'newfangled', 'designer', 'drug', 'insatiable', 'thirst', 'blood', 'distibuted', 'unsuspecting', 'users', 'unintended', 'consequences', 'abound', 'entire', 'concept', 'designer', 'drug', 'wreaking', 'havoc', 'not', 'been', 'extensively', 'played', 'out', 'so', 'theme', 'somewhat', 'fresh', 'Obviously', 'low-budget', 'film', 'created', 'constraints', 'are', 'fairly', 'obvious', 'acceptable', 'thespian', 'skills', 'main', 'players', 'made', 'story', 'least', 'watchable', 'more', 'can', 'say', 'many', 'subpar', 'horror', 'dogs', 'Fate', 'Decoys', 'ilk']",Side FX
