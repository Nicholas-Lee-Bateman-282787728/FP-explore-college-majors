I was disappointed what few songs were played constantly were interrupted, and twice the sound track was not in synch with his singing. Overall? Best part i enjoyed was the reunion of ALL 30 of the past and present members of Jethro Tull. Some of the extras were kind of silly, but i suppose you'd have to be British to understand. If you are looking for an addition to your Tull dvd collection, this one would fit in nicely..But if you're looking for Ian Anderson's music?

768783,A1TJJ7W8SF75D,B0000AYK0J,Timothy T. Ward,"[1, 1]","This is an interesting retrospective of Jethro Tull's journey for the first 25 years. The conceptual format of vintage video excerpts in between clips of band members past and present for a reunion in an English tavern comes off as ideal. ""Witches Promise,"" shown here through a 1971 performance from Top of the Pops will make viewers say, ""Oh my God,"" and a lot of the vintage footage from the first few years is sometimes comical as you see Jethro Tull starting out as a folk-rock outfit trying to find their harder edge, which they eventually did with many years of commercial success. Jethro Tull's best decade was the 70's, musically and artistically, and this DVD should include some more concert footage from that era than what is actually provided. The clips of ""Nothing is Easy,"" ""Minstrel in the Gallery,"" ""Auqalung,"" and ""Songs From the Wood,"" are the highlights, but of all the parts from their 1973 Passion Play tour, the only clip included here is the only dull portion of that whole concept album with ""The Story of the Hare Who Lost His Spectacles,""(never quite understood that part anyway)and the excerpts from Tull's transformation into the 80's seem less interesting, especialy the video for 1989's ""Kissing Willie,"" which only serves as an embarrassment for Tull having to accept that such a great band made such a terrible song and video. The reflections and bits of interviews with Ian anderson and his bandmates is always worth a listen, and overall this anniversary collection is a must-have edition for the true Jethro Tull fan.",3,Let me bring you memories of Tull,1164931200,"12 1, 2006",2006,1553,"['interesting', 'retrospective', 'Jethro', 'Tull', 'journey', 'first', '25', 'years', 'conceptual', 'format', 'vintage', 'video', 'excerpts', 'clips', 'band', 'members', 'past', 'present', 'reunion', 'English', 'tavern', 'off', 'ideal', 'Witches', 'Promise', 'shown', 'here', '1971', 'performance', 'Top', 'Pops', 'will', 'make', 'viewers', 'say', 'Oh', 'God', 'lot', 'vintage', 'footage', 'first', 'few', 'years', 'sometimes', 'comical', 'see', 'Jethro', 'Tull', 'starting', 'out', 'folk-rock', 'outfit', 'trying', 'find', 'harder', 'edge', 'eventually', 'did', 'many', 'years', 'commercial', 'success', 'Jethro', 'Tull', 'best', 'decade', 'was', '70', 'musically', 'artistically', 'DVD', 'should', 'include', 'more', 'concert', 'footage', 'era', 'what', 'actually', 'provided', 'clips', 'Nothing', 'Easy', 'Minstrel', 'Gallery', 'Auqalung', 'Songs', 'Wood', 'are', 'highlights', 'parts', '1973', 'Passion', 'Play', 'tour', 'only', 'clip', 'included', 'here', 'only', 'dull', 'portion', 'whole', 'concept', 'album', 'Story', 'Hare', 'Who', 'Lost', 'Spectacles', 'never', 'quite', 'understood', 'part', 'anyway', 'excerpts', 'Tull', 'transformation', '80', 'seem', 'less', 'interesting', 'especialy', 'video', '1989', 'Kissing', 'Willie', 'only', 'embarrassment', 'Tull', 'having', 'accept', 'such', 'great', 'band', 'made', 'terrible', 'song', 'video', 'reflections', 'bits', 'interviews', 'Ian', 'anderson', 'bandmates', 'always', 'listen', 'overall', 'anniversary', 'collection', 'must-have', 'edition', 'true', 'Jethro', 'Tull', 'fan']",N/A

To add even more spice, I have seen them live in the Caesaria Amphitheater a couple of months after buying the DVD and man - they (Anderson and Barre) did not lose their touch.The selection of music in the DVD is good but limited only to those tracks they played in various TV shows over the years before the MTV era. Since you don't expect a 5.1 sound mix you're not disappointed; However the editing could have been better; This DVD tries to be both a documentary and a collection of full tracks but at the end of the day it's neither.Still - the mix of tracks is good enogh to urge you to take out their great albums such as Aqualung, Songs from the Wood, Thick as a Brick etc. and enjoy their great music.",4,Living in the past (and enjoying it...),1098403200,"10 22, 2004",2004,850,"['have', 'recently', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'not', 'listening', 'Tull', 'few', 'years', 'definitely', 'was', 'catalyst', 're-enjoy', 'great', 'group', 'add', 'even', 'more', 'spice', 'have', 'seen', 'live', 'Caesaria', 'Amphitheater', 'couple', 'months', 'buying', 'DVD', 'man', 'Anderson', 'Barre', 'did', 'not', 'lose', 'touch.The', 'selection', 'music', 'DVD', 'good', 'limited', 'only', 'tracks', 'played', 'various', 'TV', 'shows', 'years', 'MTV', 'era', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', '5.1', 'sound', 'mix', ""'re"", 'not', 'disappointed', 'However', 'editing', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'DVD', 'be', 'documentary', 'collection', 'full', 'tracks', 'end', 'day', 'neither.Still', 'mix', 'tracks', 'good', 'enogh', 'urge', 'take', 'out', 'great', 'albums', 'such', 'Aqualung', 'Songs', 'Wood', 'Thick', 'Brick', 'etc', 'enjoy', 'great', 'music']",N/A
