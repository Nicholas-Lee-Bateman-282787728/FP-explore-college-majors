Was it meant to be a ""Finding himself"" montage? If so, why would they just make him run around? What? Couldn't the filmmakers think of a better montage than that? Probably not it seems.

With his bulging muscles always on show he reminds me of Arnold Schwarzenegger, only more wooden. He's 'destined' to have a lame sword fight with Vinnie Jones (as Cain, the king of the vampire family).Along the way Shawn Black rescues Lena (played by Rachelle Leah done up like Megan Fox, and she would given Megan a run for her money). She looks hot. Only she barely does anything. Like she stands there next to ""Shawn Black"" and does nothing as he machine-guns vampires. He doesn't even give her a gun.Tattoo artist Kat Von D plays Vanya is is quite sexy but equally has very little to do but stand around and watch. It's like the women can't do anything but stand around looking sexy - with the vampire women having the additional acting role of hissing and bareing their fangs.This is a terrible film",1,Bled out,1300665600,"03 21, 2011",2011,1235,"['dreadful', 'film', 'ideas', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'including', 'recent', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'sequel', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'Thirst', 'vampire', 'king', 'inviting', 'lots', 'people', 'party', 'can', 'slay', 'people', 'final', 'chase', 'sequence', 'Mad', 'Max', 'only', 'night', 'vampires', 'try', 'take', 'out', 'heroes', 'big', 'rig.Michael', 'Matthias', 'Blade', 'type', 'character', 'martial-arts', 'gun-toting', 'slayer', 'called', 'Shawn', 'Black', 'bulging', 'muscles', 'always', 'show', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'only', 'more', 'wooden', ""'destined"", 'have', 'lame', 'sword', 'fight', 'Vinnie', 'Jones', 'Cain', 'king', 'vampire', 'family', 'way', 'Shawn', 'Black', 'Lena', 'played', 'Rachelle', 'Leah', 'done', 'up', 'Megan', 'Fox', 'would', 'given', 'Megan', 'run', 'money', 'hot', 'Only', 'barely', 'anything', 'there', 'next', 'Shawn', 'Black', 'nothing', 'vampires', ""n't"", 'even', 'give', 'gun.Tattoo', 'artist', 'Kat', 'Von', 'D', 'Vanya', 'quite', 'sexy', 'equally', 'very', 'little', 'do', 'stand', 'around', 'watch', 'women', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'stand', 'looking', 'sexy', 'vampire', 'women', 'having', 'additional', 'acting', 'role', 'hissing', 'bareing', 'fangs.This', 'terrible', 'film']",N/A

The Bleeding is so unbelievably awful that you'll sit in your seat wondering to yourself how anyone could put up the cash to make this turkey, let alone how the actors in it show no shame in being here.  Michael Matthias stars as an Army Ranger who comes home to find his parents murdered, and is soon on the trail of a murderous vampire lord (Vinnie Jones).  Michael Madsen phones it in as a booze-loving priest, and there's pointless cameos from Kat Von D, DMX, and Armand Assante to boot.  Keep in mind that I usually love gleefully bad direct-to-video horror flicks, but The Bleeding offers no degree of enjoyment whatsoever.  From the horrible acting (Michael Matthias sounds like he's reading his lines off a cue card, which in all honesty he probably is) to the confusing story to the poorly filmed action scenes to atrocious film editing, the badness that is The Bleeding is almost too much to handle.

The film starts out with a Vin Diesel look-a-like, Michael Matthias as Shawn Black. He is driving a semi being chased by a gaggle of vampires. As one vampire attaches itself to the driver's side window, our hero says, ""get down"" as he pulls out a shotgun and blasts said vampire. The window doesn't break, but looks cracked. There is blood all over the outside of the window he just shot at. Later his shot gun sometimes works like an automatic weapon. Ed Wood, move over. I understand vampires aren't real, but we need to obey some of the laws of physics.We now flash back 3 days, during which we also flash back to Afghanistan. I won't explain too much of the reasoning behind stuff as a lot doesn't make sense. Such as:1) Vampires have a king that is born every 100-200 years. Their goal is to destroy mankind.2) Vampires don't like silver bullets.3) If you shoot a guy in the chest multiple times and he doesn't slow down, what makes you think you can punch him out?Rachelle Leah is also in this film as Lena. She plays a tough girl who can handle her own. She is Maxim's 85th most hottest woman in the world.Michael Madson plays a priest who drinks JD, except for breakfast, which is made for beer.  There is some Biblical stuff loosely scattered into the plot and rather badly. Cain is the head vampire that only ""The Slayer"" can kill.Nudity, (Not Rachelle) groping, no sex.

After finding his parents dead, Shawn finds out that his brother (Jones) has become a vampire.  Shawn is the only one that can kill him, and the hunt begins.  This is a hard movie to review, only for the fact that I'm not sure what this movie was.  If it was meant to be a serious film then it was terrible.  If it was meant to be a type of satire and over-the-top on purpose then it was great.  I'm gonna assume the later because I can't believe this was supposed to be serious (Michael Madsen plays a heavily cursing priest).  It was funny and entertaining and not a bad way to spend an hour and a half.  The dialoge is campy and the acting is pretty bad, but if you look at it as a cheesy on purpose movie it's good.
