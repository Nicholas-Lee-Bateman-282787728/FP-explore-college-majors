I rely upon Amazon Prime; and their Instant Video's for a large portion of my viewing pleasure; but this time I am very disappointed. I purchased another video last week; and it plays perfectly, no lines, no choppy dialog. I hate to throw good money @ a situation; and purchase the movie in HD w/ out knowing there would be a marked improvement, if anyone has experience w/ the HD version I'd greatly appreciate the input, as I said, very disappointed.I love this movie; and have searched for it for years, but it took forever to play, error after error appearing, and when it did eventually come on it was as though I were watching it on Video Tape; there were lines throughout from the title sequence through to the wedding scene @ the end, and some dialog was chopped. I didn't purchase the HD version; so I can't speak to whether it would be better.As I said; it's a wonderful movie, one of my favorites, just wish it had the quality I'd hoped for.",1,Love the Movie; Hate the Lines Throughout.,1393891200,"03 4, 2014",2014,1090,"['Update', 'Tried', 'watching', 'again', 'today', 'continued', 'receive', 'Error1001.3172', 'also', 'lines', 'remain', 'why', 'lowered', 'rating', 'rely', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'Instant', 'Video', 'large', 'portion', 'viewing', 'pleasure', 'time', 'am', 'very', 'disappointed', 'purchased', 'video', 'last', 'week', 'perfectly', 'lines', 'choppy', 'dialog', 'hate', 'throw', 'good', 'money', 'situation', 'purchase', 'movie', 'HD', 'w/', 'out', 'knowing', 'there', 'would', 'be', 'marked', 'improvement', 'anyone', 'experience', 'w/', 'HD', 'version', ""'d"", 'greatly', 'appreciate', 'input', 'said', 'very', 'disappointed.I', 'love', 'movie', 'have', 'searched', 'years', 'took', 'forever', 'play', 'error', 'error', 'appearing', 'when', 'did', 'eventually', 'come', 'was', 'were', 'watching', 'Video', 'Tape', 'were', 'lines', 'title', 'sequence', 'wedding', 'scene', '@', 'end', 'dialog', 'was', 'chopped', 'did', ""n't"", 'purchase', 'HD', 'version', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'would', 'be', 'better.As', 'said', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'one', 'favorites', 'just', 'wish', 'had', 'quality', ""'d"", 'hoped']",N/A
1413150,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B004LLIRQI,David Baldwin,"[5, 6]","This film takes up about ten or fifteen years after the original film.  Jill Kinmont (Marilyn Hassett) has now become a role model for quadraplegics by becoming a successful school teacher in Los Angeles.  There's an underlying sadness to her, though.  She does not have a true love in her life.  Qualify that by saying that she does not allow love to come into her life for fear of being hurt.  Enter John Boothe(Timothy Bottoms) a kind-hearted truck driver.  Despite Jill's protestations Boothe will not go quietly into the night.  The central romance here is touching and believable not in a Hollywood cliched way.  I viewed this film after seeing the original.  I wondered if it could aesthetically stand alone without the original.  The answer is a resounding yes because the sequel successfully references the first film through flashbacks that fill in the blanks.  Would I give the film five stars if I hadn't seen the first?  That's something I'll never know.  I asked my wife which film she liked better and she said resoundingly she preferred the second.

I wanted it to be like the first (which I really cared for) and it wasn't. That is the reason I am not as strong on it as I was the first. It is a wonderful story however and I am glad I have both. The second is more about how she pulled her life together, the courage and strength. It played the positive more then the hard times I know exist in recovering from such a terrible accident. It does complete her story which overall is inspiring as is what she did with the rest of her life.
