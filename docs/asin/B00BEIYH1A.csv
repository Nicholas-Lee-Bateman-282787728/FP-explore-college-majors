But I've done a lot more than most people three times my age.&#34;  Sure, I'm paraphrasing a bit, and sure, the quote is probably a little off.  But  I would say that her quote is not only correct from her character's perspective, but it's also correct from her personal life as well.If you take a peek at her filmography, you will quickly see that she's been acting for at least 10 years now.  And that wouldn't be too impressive, but only if you forgot the fact that she's only 17 now.  She could quit acting today and still have starred in more films than most actresses.  And acted well.And while this may not be her greatest performance, it's certainly solid again.  Like I've written ad nauseum, you can almost guarantee that the second film in a series is almost always the worst, and while you may argue that it holds here, it doesn't matter much; the first film was so Kick-Ass that, even if the second was only minor-Kick-Ass, the second was still, well, Kick-Ass.I loved the humor in this film.  Sure, there's lot of violence.  Sure, there are more than enough swear words to go around for a lifetime.  Sure, this film is not for everyone.

1627386,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B00BEIYH1A,C. Sawin,"[26, 39]","The first ""Kick-Ass"" had this proper balance of comedy, drama, and action that made it incredibly entertaining. Even Nicolas Cage had a strong performance in the film. Maybe it's the absence of stars like Cage and Mark Strong and that director Matthew Vaughn was replaced with Jeff Wadlow for the sequel that cause ""Kick-Ass 2"" to be a lesser film in comparison to the original or that the writing just doesn't cut it at all.While Jim Carrey publicly stated that the violence in ""Kick-Ass 2"" was too severe for him to promote, Colonel Stars and Stripes is the best part of the film. The character will have you wishing that the role was a bit bigger than it is, but the accent Carrey uses along with the character's brief background, fantastic dialogue, and quick switch into his hyperviolent mode makes Colonel Stars and Stripes the most memorable character of the film. The Colonel's dog Eisenhower is a very close second.Donald Faison is also quite amusing despite only having a very small role and most of Hit-Girl's action sequences are as awesome as ever. Christopher Mintz-Plasse has his moments while John Leguizamo actually brings shades of compassion as Chris D'Amico's bodyguard Javier. The scene involving Mother Russia (Olga Kurkulina) putting her $50,000 a week to good use is great because it's so ridiculous.Everything else surrounding the film either leaves you feeling very mixed about the film or leaves you disliking what you just witnessed. While Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Chloe Grace-Moretz give stronger performances than in comparison to ""Kick-Ass,"" the overall product is of inferior quality. The majority of the humor feels extremely juvenile. Hit-Girl was always foul-mouthed, but she also had heart. Now it all just seems so forced. Even as a fan of toilet humor, the ""sick stick"" is a bit much. Mindy and Dave go through exactly the same story arc, as well. This doesn't sound like much of an issue on the surface, but when you have to watch Mindy be gung-ho about being a superhero, then not want to be one, then want to be one again before Dave goes through exactly the same thing in the span of an hour and 40 minutes it all becomes a little redundant and tiresome.We know there's no chance Big Daddy is returning for this film, but do they have to point that out so often in this sequel? It honestly seems like you see Big Daddy's empty costume half a dozen times in the film. It's a basic thing to do for a superhero story, but showing it so often kind of makes it lose its meaning. The ending and after credits scene is massively predictable while the Hit-Girl sequence on top of the van has her being a bit more agile than she should be in a situation like that. The entire ""Mean Girls"" and high school drama side story that Mindy goes through feels like nothing more than a pit stop, which it is.There are a few things ""Kick-Ass 2"" does right like introduce a few really memorable new characters and it does manage to land a joke or two every once in awhile, but saying it stands in the shadow of its predecessor is an understatement. Its monotonous writing restrains the sequel from enhancing the story the way that it should.

1627389,A2LCE1D0TW2XY0,B00BEIYH1A,D. Alexander,"[16, 23]","I'm re-titling this Kick-Ass 2: In Search of Rational Characters. It's exciting. There's a real sense of danger, mostly because the filmmakers ignore genre conventions. But this is very much a plot-driven exercise held up almost entirely by one actress.Since the first Kick-Ass, the eponymous superhero has hung up his cape. For about ten seconds. Then he joins a superhero crew, eventually facing off with a foaming and frothing Christopher Mintz-Plasse who took the death of his father from the first film rather personally. In between, Chloe Moretz alternates between killing people and attempting to be normal.This isn't a bad film. It's just not exceptional like the first one. Everything from the music to the camerawork is a little less inspired. In Moretz's first appearance three years ago, there was a frenetic, childish background number that elevated the WTF-factor to eleven. Here, it's mostly just generic score, and that sort of indifference mutes the action scenes. The two most compelling (including a Matrix-style highway melee) still trump the outlandish CGI carnage from most movies with 'legitimate' superheros, but there's nothing here with the emotional impact of Nic Cage's video ransacking, Moretz's night-vision rescue, or the Elvis minigun number.Partly to blame is the lack of an emotional core and a strong villain. Cage anchored the first film. All the violence was in service to his injustice. There's no equivalent here; Jim Carrey isn't onscreen long enough to play the role, and no one else has a compelling motivation. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is only back to crime-fighting because he's bored, and his adversary isn't a black belt mob boss with a business to run, but a decidedly unserious teenager in BDSM gear. All the minor characters are caricatures; the major ones are internally inconsistent. Why would a guy call the murderer of his relative 'dude' and then start lecturing him about 'real life'? Why would a girl who thinks nothing of amputating limbs be hurt by the rejection of someone she doesn't respect?Wild tonal shifts swirl into that morass. Very few people actually died in the first Kick-Ass that weren't generic baddies. In this one, the script thinks nothing of offing cops or sympathetic secondary characters at random. Then we get jokes about impotence and dead sharks. Explicit violence lends verisimilitude to some scenes in the middle third, but that's out the window by the end; guns disappear whenever the script calls for ten minutes of physical beatings. The final fight resembles the brawl from The Outsiders with more colorful costumes.Caveats aside, Moretz carries the film. She's stellar, vastly better than the script. On the other end is Mintz-Plasse, who the producers apparently told to chew the scenery, vomit it back up, and then swallow it again. His character alternates between insanity and teenage insecurity. I had no idea Carrey was in the movie until I checked IMDB. He's totally unrecognizable and steals every scene he shares with Aaron Taylor-Johnson.I'm giving Kick-Ass 2 four stars because it was engaging to watch and emotionally affecting, despite the ham-handed writing. If you liked the first one, you'll probably like this one.

Mindy Macready is the exact opposite: she, too, fought evil, but is forced to give it up after her father's death by her new warden, who just wants her to be a normal girl.  But neither's lives are going to be the same, because Dave killed Chris D'Amico's crime lord father, and now Chris is out for vengeance...bloody, bloody vengeance.KICK ASS 2 is arguably even more violent than the first.  In fact, Jim Carrey's comments after the Sandy Hook tragedy actually may have some merit (even if it's just another case of a celebrity jumping on a popular bandwagon); some of the violence in KICK ASS 2 is wholly gratuitous and over-the-top, at times so much so that it's off-putting.  But, of course, you should already know that going in.  All said and done, it's still just a movie, one with a thick sense of humor (albeit extremely dark humor).Returning cast members Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Chloe Grace Moretz, and Christopher Mintz-Plasse are in fine form (even if the film's plot has Hit Girl hanging up her cape for a bit; she's sorely missed in the film's middle section).  Morris Chestnut has a lot more screen time, thankfully.  John Leguizamo is a welcome addition, as usual.  And Jim Carrey, despite disowning the film, gives a fantastic performance.  In fact, the overall plot is highly intriguing, and the caliber of performances are about as high as you can expect in this type of film.  It's hardly for anyone; and it's certainly slow going until Carrey enters the picture.

The villains became comical stereotypes rather than brutal mafia and we were faced with a Hit Girl who gave warnings after a modest beat-down. Did the villains commit murder, sure, but they were cartoons. They were allowed to commit over-the-top murder because we knew the cartoons would get theirs.The film was obviously toned down because the producers realized their target audience were teens and that teens have parents and special interest groups who bray on about violence, etc. Also, teens like sparkly vampires and revenge on the bullies at school.

1627417,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00BEIYH1A,FNDNreview,"[8, 11]","Initially, the premise of the Kick-Ass universe seemed like such an arbitrary idea.  After all, who would read a comic book about a bunch of kids trying to emulate comic book characters?  These kids are the equivalent of Peter Parker, only without the super powers, but not unlike Batman - minus the ambition and wealth.  They live in the real world in an unforgiving setting where it would be completely impossible for any of these characters to keep their identities a secret, not to mention live long enough to fight actual crime for more than a day.  In any event, the comic book mini-series was quickly adapted to film in 2010, and Kick-Ass went on to gross nearly $100, prompting creators Mark Millar and John Romita Jr. to begin work on a comic book sequel, Kick-Ass 2 - which was also quickly adapted to film.Directed by Jeff Wadlow (Cry Wolf, Never Back Down), Kick-Ass 2 once again stars Aaron Taylor-Johnson as David Lizewski aka Kick-Ass and Chlo Grace Moretz as Mindy Macready aka Hit-Girl.  After the death of her father, Hit-Girl is having trouble adapting to a normal life of high school and studying.  But, she makes a promise to her guardian, Marcus (Morris Chestnut) to give up being Hit-Girl.  At the same time, David is bored after having a taste of being a superhero and decides to hit the streets once again by joining a group of superheroes, called ""Justice Forever.""  Still coping with the death of his father, Chris D'Amico (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) has revenge on the mind and hatches a plan to eliminate Kick-Ass as payback for murdering his father.  Now working under a new, profane identity, D'Amico hires a group of villains to counter Justice Forever.  It's an all-out war between heroes and villains, and absolutely no one is safe.  Jim Carrey, Clark Duke, John Leguizamo, and Lindy Booth also star in supporting roles.While the first Kick-Ass film was a bit slow-going at first, it eventually picked-up the pace about half-way through the film, which definitely helped set the tone for the sequel.  With the characters fully established, the sequel had plenty of opportunity and potential - and it most certainly didn't disappoint.  Naturally, in order to enjoy a story like this, you'll quickly need to come to grips with the idea that it's completely silly, non-realistic, and basically a joke.  However, the characters in this sequel do everything in their power to send a message that this film stands on its own merits, outside a world where superheroes can fly, bend metal, or shoot laser beams out of their eyes - and so on and so forth.  At no point during this sequel does it feel dull, boring, or un-entertaining.  The action is relatively constant, and even though the jokes are silly and costumes look like something you'd buy at Wal-Mart, it doesn't delude the quality of the film - unless you simply didn't enjoy the first endeavor.By far and away, the most enjoyable character of the Kick-Ass franchise is Hit-Girl.  Despite her young age, she steals every scene with her charisma - and Batgirl-like costume, complete with wig and purple motorcycle.  Following her lead is Christopher Mintz-Plasse, who does surprising well as a villain, although he comes off as a bit too tyrannical at times.  If this were a real-life superhero situation, he'd probably have someone twice his size slap him and put him in the corner.  Regardless, his attitude is on par with the character, but his name is probably over-the-line, along with his bondage-based black leather costume.  Finally, it should be noted that Jim Carrey portrays a likeable character, called Colonel Stars and Stripes - with a background as a former mob enforcer.  Despite his disdain for the film's violence, Carrey is actually one of the most violent characters, essentially taking over the role as the elder mentor for Nicholas Cage.Obviously, the elephant in the room is in regards to this film is focused solely on Jim Carrey and his comments about Kick-Ass being far too violent.  Is Kick-Ass 2 a violent film?  The simple answer is yes, but that doesn't necessarily mean Jim Carrey was right to criticize this film.  If you're a parent and you watch this flick, there will be a number of things that bother you about it - namely the violence inflicted to and by characters that are portraying high school students - not to mention you will most likely also be bothered by the language being used by a sixteen year old girl.  However, if these issues are such a hang-up, the simple solution is to not watch it.  Kick-Ass is not the only movie on the market with an abundance of violence and abusive language.  American culture is based on the idea of individual choice, and people that are uncomfortable with Kick-Ass should exercise their right not to watch.Overall, Kick-Ass 2 is superior to its predecessor in nearly every way possible.  There's more action, a more elaborate story, and the characters are given an allotted amount of space to expand their individual stories without focusing too much on one specific storyline.  Even though this film feeds off the success of past comic book film - one example includes a rough reenactment of The Dark Knight Rises' final battle between heroes and villains, the film still manages to create constant entertainment and endless fan boy pleasure.  And, if you can manage to look past the senseless violence, sexuality, and abusive language, you'll find a story that tells an interesting, action-packed tale about kids wanting to be superheroes.P.S. - Don't forget to stick around for the post-credits scene. Bring on the trilogy's finale.GRADE:  BFNDNreview.com",4,"'Kick-Ass 2' a superior, entertaining sequel",1376697600,"08 17, 2013",2013,5625,"['Initially', 'premise', 'Kick-Ass', 'universe', 'seemed',

It had an unusual quality and personality that separated it from almost all films of that genre. It was memorable and could have joined the Swedish ""Girl...Dragon Tattoo"" in status. Kick Ass 2 with a different writer and director ruined any opportunity at sustaining that legacy. In place of difficult practiced performance and action scenes we were given the alternative of countless nauseous brief & changing camera angles as a cheap substitute. Thus, creating a just not believable (almost laughable) illusion of action. Even the helmeted sub for Mindy on a hot bike came off as a gratuitous cheap stunt trick. Another cheap prop was her electronic device creating a not believable vomiting/diarrhea CGI scene.

I found Kick Ass 2 entertaining, it held my interest until the end, but it was not near as good as the original. A strong story line was simply missing. The plot I am sure was written to be consistent with the comic book series, but I had honestly hoped for more than just the usual teenage angst, the mean high school girls throwing up in the lunch room, and Red Mist changing his name to something unprintable and making odd fashion choices. Still, this is a must see for those interested in following the original story, seeing what happens to the surviving characters from Kick Ass, and of course those interested in seeing how far Hit Girl will evolve as a super hero.",3,Sequels are rarely as good as the original,1376697600,"08 17, 2013",2013,974,"['young', 'adult', 'children', 'introduced', 'Kick', 'Ass', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'loved', 'over-the-top', 'farce', 'ironic', 'humor', 'great', 'music', 'excellent', 'sets', 'bizarre', 'interesting', 'characters', 'brilliant', 'style', 'directing', 'filming', 'actual', 'storyline', 'had', 'beginning', 'middle', 'end', 'found', 'Kick', 'Ass', '2', 'entertaining', 'held', 'interest', 'end', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'strong', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'simply', 'missing', 'plot', 'am', 'sure', 'was', 'written', 'be', 'consistent', 'comic', 'book', 'series', 'had', 'honestly', 'hoped', 'more', 'just', 'usual', 'teenage', 'angst', 'mean', 'high', 'school', 'girls', 'throwing', 'up', 'lunch', 'room', 'Red', 'Mist', 'changing', 'name', 'something', 'unprintable', 'making', 'odd', 'fashion', 'choices', 'Still', 'must', 'see', 'interested', 'following', 'original', 'story', 'seeing', 'what', 'surviving', 'characters', 'Kick', 'Ass', 'course', 'interested', 'seeing', 'how', 'far', 'Hit', 'Girl', 'will', 'evolve', 'super', 'hero']",N/A

I am a huge fan of the first movie and I couldn't wait to see the next one. Kick Ass 2 is pretty much like the first Kick Ass movie. A lot of action mixed with violence and goofy humor. There is more characters in this film and the action is just as good. Acting wise a few people steal the show from the stars of the first movie. Jim Carrey plays Colonel Stars and Stripes a former Mob hemchman turned masked super hero/born again christian. Now we all know that Jim didn't want to promote this picture b/c of the violence and don't get me started on that and I feel that might have hurt the movies box office performance here in America but I still think he steals every scene he is in. The down point on that is that there is very few scenes with him. Another new character this time on the bad side called Mother Russia is just great. The way she hunts and kills anything that gets in her way truly had the audience at the theater on the edge of their seats. You will leave the theater quoting lines from her and thinking that you wished she was in the movie a lot more. The leads like Kick Ass and Hit Girl are still great in this movie and Hit Girl really gets a lot of character development in this which is a good thing. I have to say I did miss seeing Nic Cage as Big Daddy in this film. I think he really helped the first movie rise to that epic level when he gets killed off leaving his daughter alone and out for revenge,So as I do not think it is as good as the first movie I think it came very close to it. I hope to see a 3rd and final movie to this series which is hinted as the death of Kick Ass. But who knows.

1627439,A276BSDSBYTULH,B00BEIYH1A,"Jason Kleeberg ""J. Kleeberg""","[10, 16]","I really liked the first Kick-Ass.  I thought that it made some good changes to Mark Millar's graphic novel and recreated the really fun tale of regular people turned heroes.  When Kick-Ass 2 was announced, I was stoked...until I found out that Matthew Vaughn was no longer going to be involved in the movie (as more than a producer).  Jeff Wadlow wrote and directed the sequel, his first rated R adventure.  So...did it kick ass?I'll start off my review by saying that Kick-Ass 2's story is an absolute mess.  I'm familiar with the source material, and I know some liberties had to be made with the story for the screen (some of the violence in the book is disgusting), but the characters here seem like that have little to no motivation to do anything.  Kick-Ass gets back into the crime fighting game...because he's bored.  One of Kick-Ass's friends becomes a super hero because...it seems cool.  Hit Girl gets back into the crime fighting game because...she's basically also bored.  Certain characters seem completely forgotten about.  This script is, simply put, a disaster.There are several really fun, really well done scenes here.  The 'van' scene (hinted at in the trailer) is outstanding.  Mother Russia showing the NYPD that she means business is another stand out scene.  However, the rest of the movie seems entirely forgettable, with the exception of Jim Carrey's charismatic turn as Captain Stars & Stripes.The direction is competent.  Wadlow lets the action breathe a bit instead of getting up close and personal with the shaky cam that I hate so much, so I did appreciate that.  You can actually tell what's going on.  The CGI blood is a little distracting (why don't we just use squibs anymore?).  The acting is competent, although Mintz-Plasse is even more annoying here than he was in the first one.Here's my bottom line...going into Kick-Ass 2, expect the following - a terrible story, some cool action scenes, and a ton of dick jokes.  Aside from a handful of scenes, this won't be a movie that you remember in a year.  Hell, you may not even remember most of it as you exit the theater.

This film however is as though the director was too afraid too keep some of the original politically incorrect material from the comic book. It is darker but also not in a good way. there is only one scene shot at night and its not even a good scene. I feel that when the villians went on a rampage it should have been at night. Most of the action comes off as goofy over the top nonsense. most jokes fall over dead and beg to be taken to the morgue and buried, but no, the director pics that dead joke up and tries to make it work. For instance the shark ""joke"" does not wrk at all but the director decided to keep kicking it until it just makes yu sick. oh yeah the sic stick. Come on really. The original film based all its weapons and tech on actually things that excist and can be bought. This film just makes up junk and says hear eat this puke. Its funny eh?...its funny right?...hahaha its funny to me the director who cares what the audience wants. yeah ok jim carrey is in it but for reasons unknown... Wait hes in it to make the audiance go hey jim carey. Kick ass is wearing big daddys armour and the director didnt even give a logical explanation to why hit girl would let him wear it. The armour is in a glass case kinda like a fallen samurais armour. ok that bit works but why is kick ass wearing it. Hit girl mindy carries this movie on her back and makes it work hats off to the actress. Kick ass does not do much in this film. He kinda sits back and lets hit girl run the show. There are elements that work like the bad guys. But there is no real motivation for why the bad guys are following chris. Other than money.

1627455,A1KBY3AWAGJYUC,B00BEIYH1A,John Miller,"[0, 1]","Not since The Godfather have I seen a movie that features scene after scene of such wanton cruelty.  Sure, there's plenty of the usual blood & guts violence (e.g. mugger gets knife shoved through foot, bad guy takes baseball bat to crotch) that was in the first movie, but there's a level of true sadism here that wasn't present in the first.  There's a difference between comedic violence (see: Kill Bill, part 1) and what goes on here.Warning: spoilers aheadHigh school kids are often cruel to each other--that's no shocker.  What was surprising here was just how matter-of-fact the cruelty was.  Dave's girlfriend walks up to him and tells him, point-blank, that she's having sex with someone she volunteers with.  Mindy is the object of a mean prank where she's abandoned by her &#34;date,&#34; left in the middle of nowhere.  Fortunately, she gets back in a rather satisfying way that is one of the movie's few bright spots.In the first movie, the actual violence was mostly comic--bad guy takes bazooka to face.  In the sequel, Dave's father is murdered in jail--hanged with his throat slit--and Dave finds out via the most graphic text message I've ever seen.  Chris D'Amico kills his own mother (presumably by accident).  One of the team of good guys is murdered while his dog watches.  A child pimp gets his genitals chewed off by said dog.  Chris D'Amico threatens to rape Dave's new girlfriend--just for fun.  Chris's crime lord uncle orders a murder and forces Chris to listen to it via cell phone.Plenty more in the semi-comedic vein, but hopefully you get the point--if you were hoping for a lighthearted movie, you'll be disappointed.  If you expected ordinary movie shoot-em-up violence, be prepared for villains who want to damage people's psyche.

1627458,A3F9VH8916IA40,B00BEIYH1A,Jonathan &#34;Jimmy Dean&#34; Lane: libertari...,"[3, 5]","Kick Ass 2 will probably disappoint a lot of people who, like me, loved the original to one degree or another. There are just too many flaws in this film to not, at some point, feel a little jilted. There are many times when it matches the greatness of the original film but as a whole this film comes nowhere near the level of ass kicking awesomeness we all fell in love with just a few years ago. It's just not as well made, and doesn't have the same love and attention it seems to me as the first movie. To make a comparison, this is The Dark knight Rises whereas the first movie was Dredd mixed with Iron Man. It even has the same kind of big nonsensical finale. That may not sound like a bad thing, after all a whole lot of people (not including myself) loved Dark Knight Rises, but for a movie like Kick Ass 2 the overly long and convoluted plot and wishy washing direction put a damper on this film. Like Dark Knight Rises, most of the movie is spent trying to get both our main hero's back into their costumes and doing the things we all wanted to see them do in the first place. First Hit Girl is a hero and Kick Ass is out. Then Kick Ass is a hero and Hit Girl is out. Then both are out, and then they're both in. Come on, was all that really necessary? I mean you have two much liked, well established ""super heroes"" already here, there's no need to spend almost the entire movie with at least one of them out of game entirely. What I wanted more than anything in this film was to see Hit Girl doing her thing like she did at the end of the first movie, but nothing she does here comes close to the jaw dropping action sequences she had before. Don't get me wrong, what she DOES get to do is really cool, but there's just not enough of it.What saves this movie from a three rating is that, for all its faults, there's no denying the huge grin I had while watching. Hit Girl may not have that huge action sequence that steals the show like in the first movie, but as I said before when she does don the purple jumpsuit and whips out her swords what follows is always a treat. Kick Ass doesn't get as many big action scenes, but he's always been more bumbling sidekick ""super hero"" then the Batman like ninja assassin Hit Girl is. His action scenes fit his character, and are a lot of fun in the same manner as his fights in the previous movie were. But who really steals the show is Jim Carry. Nick Cage played a great character in Big Daddy in the last film, and it's a real shame he died as he would have been great to have here. Fortunately for us, we have Jim Carry to take his place. I never would have imagined Jim Carry could have pulled off a role like this, especially after the long absence from notable films he's had. Jim Carry owns his role as ex mafia enforcer, and new leader of the Justice Friends super group, Colonel Stars and Stripes. The crazy grin, the way he gleefully peruses criminals and even trains his dog ""Eisenhower"" to bite off the dicks of pedophiles and human traffickers, all come together to make one of the more memorable characters in the entire series. If not for the trailers I wouldn't have even known it was him until his demasking.SPOILER!!It's a real shame they killed him off, like they did with Big Daddy, but I understand the reasoning behind it. This isn't the ""Colonel Stars and Stripes"" show with Kick Ass and Hit Girl being background characters, this is Kick Ass, and you can't have Kick Ass being upstaged by Jim Carry.END SPOILER!!The main villain, mob boss son Chris D'Amico from the first film makes a return as The MotherF'er, a whiny ""super villain"" who's only claim to power is a fortune he inherits when he accidentally kills his mother which he then uses to buy an army of super badies with comically racist names. The villains can be fun at times, but there are just too many of them and none of them get any sort of attention besides Mother Russia who's pretty much the female version of the Russian from Rocky III. Other than her though, it's pretty slim pickings when it comes to memorable villains. Sure they do bad things, but besides the before mentioned Mother Russia none of them do anything of note to make them stand out. There was a short guy, an Asian guy, a black guy, and that's about the extent of their characters. Funny names, no personality. As for MotherF'er, he has his moments but again its nothing special. In fact the director seemed to go out of his way to make this guy as whiny, emo, and annoying as possible. He wasn't bad persay, he just wasn't good either.If it sounds as if I didn't like this movie, trust me, that isn't the case at all. Even for all its problems Kick Ass 2 never bored me. My eyes were glued to the screen for its entire run time, and I can honestly say I had a blast watching it. Sure it's full of corny one dimensional character, plot holes, and is at times sloppily written, but at the end of the day this is a fun as hell movie that should please the inner nerds in all of us. It's not as good as the original, that's for sure, but for what it is it still manages to deliver hours of fun.Replay value: moderate.",4,Three star movie with five star fun.,1376438400,"08 14,

Sad then that his part is kind of small in the whole thing. Even sadder is that the best thing about the first one, Hit Girl, is now starring in a weak version of Mean Girls.

Sometimes, certain critics will enjoy movies that audiences may not always enjoy and vice versa. Following the release of this movie it has been slammed by critics as "" falls flat"" and ""lacking"". After months of anticipation, i saw Kick Ass 2 today. All I want to say is forget the critics and negative press because this movie is good.Kick Ass 2 brings back Aaron Taylor Johnson as Dave Lizewski "" Kick Ass""( he buffed up) Chloe Moretz returns yet again and gives a great performance as Mindy Macready "" Hit Girl"". Also returning are Lyndsy Fonseca as Katie Deauxma, and Christopher Mintz Plasse takes the role of antagonist to the extreme playing Chris D'Amico. New, but exciting additions include: Morris Chestnut as Marcus Williams, Donald Faison as Doctor Gravity, Tom Wu as Genghis Carnage, Lindy Booth as the female hero of the night, and Jim Carrey as Colonel Stars and Stripes. There are many other supporting actors/actresses, but the actors I mentioned all were great; Jim Carrey, Chloe Moretz, and Christopher Plasse were the highlights.Ever read those stories about heroes teaming up? Well picture that; only this time bad guys/girls do the exact same. This movie also has a small element from Spider-Man 2 whereas the main hero wants to be normal and put being a superhero in the past. The movie as a whole delivers in terms of action, and relatively extreme humor. I do also feel that the seriousness in the questions:  What is a superhero? or What does it take to be a superhero? is upped even further in the sequel.Kick Ass 2 does lack the epic feel, or rather classic quality that its predecessor has, but it is NOT a bad movie. It is not nearly as memorable as the 1st, but fortunately despite the minor flaws, it is enjoyable nonetheless. If you love the 1st as much as I do you may not "" love"" this one, but I honestly think you will have a good time.

Meanwhile, the Red Mist plots an act of revenge against KA and all his friends.One of the biggest surprises to me a couple years ago was the first movie KA. I didn't know much about the movie at the time and only had seen some of the brief highlights from the trailer. Frankly at the time, I didn't have high expectations as it looked a bit &#34;hokey&#34; but I watched it and I thought at the time this was one of the sleeper hits of the year. KA had it all, action, humor, and a great story with good actors. The first movie was outstanding, which I don't give high praise often to most movies but the original deserved it as it turned out an original &#34;superhero&#34; story that was unique in a lot of ways.Then comes the sequel and unlike the original KA I had high expectations for the follow-up. Unfortunately KA 2 has a lot to live up to in my mind and like most sequels falls a bit short of the original. Nothing against the movie, but unfortunately for it, it loses the originally that the first one had simply by being second. Unfortunately there is no &#34;Big Daddy&#34; appearance by Nicholas Cage, not even in a flashback, which is a shame but Jim Carrey does an outstanding job at being Colonel Stars and Stripes. With the acting and the makeup job he is almost unrecognizable but not in a bad way. I am normally not a Carrey fan, but I will give him credit, he plays the role and plays it well, with less of his typical spiel he does in most of his movies. The movie takes a bit to find its footing I think and starts off a bit slow with &#34;Hit-girl&#34; not wanting to be &#34;Hit-girl&#34; and &#34;KA&#34; well trying to talk everyone into joining his band of crime fighters. But once it does, the action and the story picks up and gets better as time goes along, you have to give the movie a bit of time to get going but once it does, it does a good job at keeping you entertained until the end. A decent story, not as good as the first, but with the addition of some of the villians, especially &#34;Mother Russia&#34; the movie finds a way to make you like the characters good and evil. Will there be a sequel, that remains to be seen, but it would be a shame to not follow up with some more of the gang finding new villians to fight.Maybe it doesn't live up to the original and takes a bit of time to get going in the story, KA2 is decent and if you are a fan you will love it. 3.5 stars.",3,OK follow up 3.5 stars,1390694400,"01 26, 2014",2014,2547,"['costumed', 'high-school', 'hero', 'returns', 'group', 'normal', 'citizens', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'inspired', 'fight', 'crime', 'costume', 'Meanwhile', 'Red', 'Mist', 'act', 'revenge', 'KA', 'friends.One', 'biggest', 'surprises', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'first', 'movie', 'KA', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'movie', 'time', 'only', 'had', 'seen', 'brief', 'highlights', 'trailer', 'Frankly', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'high', 'expectations', 'looked', 'bit', '34', 'hokey', '34', 'watched', 'thought', 'time', 'was', 'one', 'sleeper', 'hits', 'year', 'KA', 'had', 'all', 'action', 'humor', 'great', 'story', 'good', 'actors', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'outstanding', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'high', 'praise', 'often', 'most', 'movies', 'original', 'deserved', 'turned', 'out', 'original', '34', 'superhero', '34', 'story', 'was', 'unique', 'lot', 'ways.Then', 'sequel', 'original', 'KA', 'had', 'high', 'expectations', 'follow-up', 'Unfortunately', 'KA', '2', 'lot', 'live', 'up', 'mind', 'most', 'sequels', 'bit', 'short', 'original', 'Nothing', 'movie', 'unfortunately', 'originally', 'first', 'one', 'had', 'simply', 'being', 'second', 'Unfortunately', '34', 'Big', 'Daddy', '34', 'appearance', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'not', 'even', 'flashback', 'shame', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'outstanding', 'job', 'being', 'Colonel', 'Stars', 'Stripes', 'acting', 'makeup', 'job', 'almost', 'unrecognizable', 'not', 'bad', 'way', 'am', 'normally', 'not', 'Carrey', 'fan', 'will', 'give', 'credit', 'role', 'well', 'less', 'typical', 'spiel', 'most', 'movies', 'movie', 'bit', 'find', 'footing', 'think', 'off', 'bit', 'slow', '34', 'Hit-girl', '34', 'not', 'wanting', 'be', '34', 'Hit-girl', '34', '34', 'KA', '34', 'well', 'trying', 'talk', 'everyone', 'joining', 'band', 'crime', 'fighters', 'action', 'story', 'up', 'better', 'time', 'along', 'have', 'give', 'movie', 'bit', 'time', 'get', 'going', 'once', 'good', 'job', 'keeping', 'entertained', 'end', 'decent', 'story', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'addition', 'villians', 'especially', '34', 'Mother', 'Russia', '34', 'movie', 'way', 'make', 'characters', 'good', 'evil', 'Will', 'there', 'be', 'sequel', 'be', 'seen', 'would', 'be', 'shame', 'not', 'follow', 'up', 'more', 'gang', 'finding', 'new', 'villians', 'fight.Maybe', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'original', 'bit', 'time', 'get', 'going', 'story', 'KA2', 'decent', 'are', 'fan', 'will', 'love', '3.5', 'stars']",N/A

In this sequel, ""Kick Ass 2"" written and directed by Jeff Wadlow (Never Back Down, Cry Wolf) this film picks up were the first film left you with a newly banded `super hero' team of basically regular people fed up with the US Justice system, which is made up of kids and  and vigilantes banded together to protect their city.The super hero `Kick Ass' is back with more motivation than ever to be as good as his best super hero friend (Hit Girl) and is again performed by Aaron-Taylor Johnson (Savage, The Illusionist) who does a great job of showing his angst, ambition and eventual confusion at a major crisis that is forced upon him. His father played by Steven Mackintosh (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Underworld: Evolution) tries to convince him, with a lot of passion and conviction, of doing the right thing but it all eventually leads to one of them making the ultimate sacrifice.Chloe Grace Moretz (500 Days of Summer, Hugo) is back as Hit Girl and with the death of her father in the last film and he dilemma with living with her father ex-partner, now her guardian played by Morris Chestnut (Identity Theft, Boyz N The Hood), she is torn between being the person she is - Hit Girl - or the person everyone thinks she should be. Chloe is amazing to watch both as herself and as `Hit Girl'. She could be an X-Men if you ask me!And of course you good guys like Clark Duke (Hot Tub, Greek) playing  Marty (whose alter ego is `Battle Guy'), Augustus Prew (Charlie St. Cloud, About A Boy) as Todd (whose alter ego is `Ass Kicker') and Donald Faison (Scrubs, Remember The Titans)  as  `Dr. Gravity' banding together with `Colonel Stars and Stripes'.You also have your bullies and baddies like the snarky and rude Claudia Lee (Heart of Dixie) playing Brook the high school `bi&?h' and of course Christopher Mintz-Plasse (Superbad, How To Train Your Dragon) is back as Chris (and his alter ego Motherf*&?er). Both do their very best to stop our heroes and destroy their personal lives. Add in the element of a `butler' of Chris  with a character named Javier played wonderfully by John Leguizamo (Ice Age, Moulin Rouge!) who gives his character much heart and passion to this truly idiotic example of a super villain.Now the surprising delight was the addition of Jim Carrey (Ace Ventura, The Truman Show) as `Colonel Stars and Stripes' who has a big hart but a desperate desire to violently rid the city of scum and villainy. Jim is obviously have a really great time doing it too and his physically up for the challenge as well. Pretty impressive work Jim!Overall the movie is fun and filled with action and some great fighting sequences. And you can follow these fighting sequences well because the director chose to use a standard tripod instead of the all shaking, all vomiting, all have-no-clue-who-hit-who hand-held camera style most actions films seem to think is `cool' these days. Most of the action does defy the laws of natural physics, but because you care and follow the good guys, you go with it. Clever dialogue and a big heart make this sequel better than the first for me.

1627493,A1R17YELPTSM5T,B00BEIYH1A,MacJunegrand,"[0, 0]","I feel the need to address a small point here.  I'm not a fan of the Kick-Ass comics.  I think they're poorly written, predictable, irritating, violent for the sake of violence and ridiculously juvenile (i.e. like most of Mark Millar's work).  But the movies, they're great.  They take all the good parts of the comics and ignore, rewrite and even make fun of all the bad parts.The first movie was just great.  Since the beginning it hooked you in and it had some incredibly memorable moments.  Though at times it seemed like it tried too hard to look relevant, it did a fantastic job of making a fun, entertaining and even compelling story.Along came the sequel, which is made by mostly the same team (but different director) and holds the same cast (well, those who survived) and, in general, is great too.  It doesn't reach the greatness of the first film, but it mostly does a fantastic job too.  I'm not a suscriber of the opinion that sequels can't surpass their predecessors, but this one sadly doesn't.  And it's mostly because it doesn't manage to avoid some of the pitfalls the previous film gracefully circled around.The movie starts in a slightly different place from which the first one ended.  Both main characters have grown up, but it seems like the villain has somehow regressed.  Our hero Kick-Ass has abandoned the vigilantism, but it starts it again and he's looking for partners.  Since Hit-Girl is reluctant because her tutor won't allow it, he finds partnership in people he's inspired.  Meanwhile, the villanous Red Mist rechristens himself as the Motherf****r and decides to stir revenge upon Kick-Ass by creating his own group of supervillains.  Hilarity and violence ensue.First, the good things.  The cast is as great as always, and the newcomers do a fantastic job too, specially Jim Carrey, who's practically unrecognizable under his guise as Coronel Stars and Stripes.  The story of the film is plausible for the universe of these movies, and, in general, most of the characters have very good moments.  This film has also some emotional parts, which are very well handled, and the effects are quite good.  Like the previous one, it relies more on practical effects than CGI, which is great.Buuuuuut...  then there are things that are not so good.  For instance, Hit-Girl is a great character, but her presence is minimal.  Her alter ego is relegated to what's essentially a Disney high-school drama story for most of the film, which is a spectacular waste of the character.The pace of the film is problematic too.  Some scenes drag out too long and others are not long enough.  Some things happen for no reason while others don't happen at all.  Like, Kick-Ass just decides at the beginning of the film that he will come back to vigilantism just because.  Why bother introducing him as having left the job when you're going to make him come back two minutes later?  We are introduced to The Motherf****r's uncle as the guy who really runs the bussiness after his father's death.  He does something horrible to the kid and then he gets completely ignored for the rest of the film.  Later, we have one of the most important plot points happening because some guy just happens to show up and blurt out a comment out of the blue for no reason.The movie also lacks any defining moments, like the wonderful scene with Big Daddy in the warehouse in the first film.  And then, of course, there's the violence.  I have no problem with it, but I understand why some people might think that it's unnecessary sometimes.  It doesn't reach the levels of ridiculousness from the comics, but still, it seems like it tries to compensate for the lack of defining moments with character deaths, which doesn't work.In any case, the movie has more good than bad moments.  Just like the previous one, it greatly balances action, humor and emotion.  It's just that the flaws are more noticeable and less forgivable this time around.  I still recommend it, of course.

1627495,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B00BEIYH1A,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[5, 8]","The first Kick-Ass film was a high-velocity, ultra-violent, comedo-drama about real people attempting to be superheroes. It had some riveting action sequences (most of them not for the squeamish), a deceptively straight-forward plot, and a pull-no-punches attitude towards what is often the gooey-sweet sentimentality that action hero flicks often have at their heart. The film was a success.Capitalizing off of that success, we have the sequel. As is a usual problem with follow-up films, they try to do way too much. In an attempt to either top the original or at least match whatever expectations it may have caused in the audience, the film ironically fails to do either, fumbling as it juggles far too many plot threads.Our story picks up several years after the original. Kick Ass has inspired whole legions of superhero wannabes, most of whom wander the streets ineffectually in their various, goofy outfits. They eventually face off against a villain whose name I can't type here, played by the embittered Chris, the well-to-do kid whose mafia dad was dispatched in the last film. Overall, you've got a general up-the-ante feel with the good and evil forces expanded exponentially.However, there's a whole lot of distracting elements thrown in to muddy the waters. You've got both Hit Girl and Kick Ass experiencing superhero angst, most of it propelled by their respective parental figures. You've got a dead-end sidetrack while Hit Girl tries to navigate the murky waters of high school popularity. You've got Chris screaming and moping as he gathers his band of baddies, with an equally dead-end sidetrack to his imprisoned uncle. Add in some fairly awkward jokes, action sequences that (on the whole) aren't quite as impressive as the first film, and deeply (deeply, deeply) schmaltzy dialogue about what it takes to be a superhero (apparently, all it takes is bravery), and you've got a film that feels scatterbrained and overly-sweet compared to its predecessor.While not without its charms and a few enjoyable moments, and also while not an overall disappointment, the flick nevertheless fails to really kick quite as much butt as the one that spawned it.",3,Return of the Butt Punter,1377907200,"08 31, 2013",2013,2170,"['first', 'Kick-Ass', 'film', 'was', 'high-velocity', 'ultra-violent', 'comedo-drama', 'real', 'people', 'attempting', 'be', 'superheroes', 'had', 'riveting', 'action', 'sequences', 'most', 'not', 'squeamish', 'deceptively', 'straight-forward', 'plot', 'pull-no-punches', 'attitude', 'towards', 'what', 'often', 'gooey-sweet', 'sentimentality', 'action', 'hero', 'flicks', 'often', 'have', 'heart', 'film', 'was', 'success.Capitalizing', 'off', 'success', 'have', 'sequel', 'As', 'usual', 'problem', 'follow-up', 'films', 'try', 'do', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'attempt', 'top', 'original', 'least', 'match', 'expectations', 'may', 'have', 'caused', 'audience', 'film', 'ironically', 'do', 'either', 'fumbling', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'plot', 'threads.Our', 'story', 'up', 'several', 'years', 'original', 'Kick', 'Ass', 'inspired', 'whole', 'legions', 'superhero', 'wannabes', 'most', 'whom', 'wander', 'streets', 'ineffectually', 'various', 'goofy', 'outfits', 'eventually', 'face', 'off', 'villain', 'name', 'ca', ""n't"", 'type', 'here', 'played', 'embittered', 'Chris', 'well-to-do', 'kid', 'mafia', 'dad', 'was', 'dispatched', 'last', 'film', 'Overall', ""'ve"", 'got', 'general', 'up-the-ante', 'feel', 'good', 'evil', 'forces', 'expanded', 'exponentially.However', 'whole', 'lot', 'distracting', 'elements', 'thrown', 'muddy', 'waters', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Hit', 'Girl', 'Kick', 'Ass', 'experiencing', 'superhero', 'angst', 'most', 'propelled', 'respective', 'parental', 'figures', ""'ve"", 'got', 'dead-end', 'sidetrack', 'Hit', 'Girl', 'navigate', 'murky', 'waters', 'high', 'school', 'popularity', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Chris', 'screaming', 'moping', 'band', 'baddies', 'equally', 'dead-end', 'sidetrack', 'imprisoned', 'uncle', 'Add', 'fairly', 'awkward', 'jokes', 'action', 'sequences', 'whole', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'impressive', 'first', 'film', 'deeply', 'deeply', 'deeply', 'schmaltzy', 'dialogue', 'what', 'be', 'superhero', 'apparently', 'bravery', ""'ve"", 'got', 'film', 'feels', 'scatterbrained', 'overly-sweet', 'compared', 'predecessor.While', 'not', 'charms', 'few', 'enjoyable', 'moments', 'also', 'not', 'overall', 'disappointment', 'flick', 'nevertheless', 'really', 'kick', 'quite', 'as', 'much', 'butt', 'one', 'spawned']",N/A

It is a very dark and violent &#34;superhero&#34; movie, where the heroes are real people who have no powers which of course puts them in real jeopardy.  The first film definitely had those elements and this one takes that up even more.  There are some comedic elements to this movie, but on the whole probably not as much as was in the first one.  Like the first one however the comedy is dark.Comic book adaptations of movies are always hard, because you want them to strike a balance between telling the story of the comic, but not always being locked into everything the book does.  I have not read the comics, but I know just in terms of the timing of how the movie sets the story vs what the comic did there are a lot of differences.  So those who would be disappointed that the movie does not follow lock step with the comic, probably want to avoid the movie.Unlike the first movie which really set up a second movie well, this one ends so that the franchise can either end with it, or continue on.  In the bonus material it is more than once strongly hinted that there will be a third movie.  On the whole I would say that this movie is not as original as the first, but that is to be expected.  I would say it is as action packed as the first though.  It is very violent, with a lot of bad language and a little bit of nudity, so if those things turn you off to a movie you will want to skip it as well.For those who get the disc, the movie looks and sounds great on blu ray.  If you watch the extras, there is about an hour or so worth of material from deleted and extended scenes, a making of feature and behind the scenes bonus material.

I arrived with about two hours to wait and there were about 40 people already ahead of me so I knew I was going to get into the movie. Let me just start by saying, it was well worth the wait if you're a fan of the original.Let me say right now there are spoilers in this review so don't read it if you don't want to know any of this.Obviously most of you are aware that Chris D'Amico / Red Mist is the Main villain in this film but, he's taken on a new identity known as The Mother F****r and his getup consists of his mom's old bondage outfit. Well his main goal is to make Kick-Ass pay for blowing his dad up. Of course, his mom is holding back his ambitions so, he had to kill her to get her out of the way; once that's done, he begins to form his evil posse known as the Toxic Mega C**ts.Kick-Ass approaches Hit Girl about training him and forming a team and she agrees as she has been skipping school and training everyday since her dad died. Unfortunately, Marcus (her legal guardian) finds out and reminds her that her father's letter wanted better for her so, she backs out of the deal and retires Hit Girl.Colonel Stars and Stripes has already begun forming the team Justice Forever; His team would become the new partners for the man that inspired them in the first place... Kick-Ass!Uncle Ralph took over the family when Chris' father was killed. In an attempt to dissuade Chris from forming his posse Uncle Ralph has Chris' only friend killed and this lesson is not lost on the MotherF****r as he learns to hurt Kick-Ass, he has to hurt those closest to him.So, the basic plot of the movie has always been revenge against Kick-Ass and this revenge starts with the death of Colonel Stars and Stripes, the Beating of Night B***h, and the Death of Kick-Ass' Father. Of course, the ultimate goal is to break the inspiration that is Kick-Ass by killing him, cutting him up, and feeding him to sharks (that's the plan anyway).Through most of the Movie, the MotherF***r and the Toxic Mega C**ts are wreaking havoc on the city and terrorizing the police. To say the least, the lack of Colonel Stars and Stripes has made Justice Forever a little bit weak and the lack of Hit Girl makes matters even worse.My only real gripe with the movie is that they made Todd an even bigger idiot than in the first movie. Everything else about the movie was great and I really enjoyed it.Believe me, if you were at all a fan of the first movie, you're going to love this one!

1627539,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B00BEIYH1A,Robert Badgley,"[3, 5]","Kick Ass Two(released Aug/13) stars,among others,Aaron Taylor-Johnson,Christopher Mintz-Plasse,Chlo Grace Moretz and Jim Carrey.Has anyone noticed the three main stars use three names for identification? Just thought I'd throw that in there.KA2 unfortunately does not live up to the high standard of the first,then again very few sequels do.The story finds our two protagonists Moretz and Johnson with a bit of an identity crisis on their hands.Moretz is now living with her guardian Marcus and she is consistently skipping school and keeping in training as Hit Girl.Johnson starts retraining also with Hit Girl but it soon comes crashing down when Marcus discovers the school skipping.She is grounded and is forced to promise not to don the tights again.Johnson is left on his own and hitches up with a rag tag group of civilian do-gooders started by Carrey.Moretz meanwhile tries to play the typical high school student but,in the end,with the predictable and unsatisfying results we all saw coming a mile away.Johnson,with his new group,has been kicking some baddie butt and seems to be doing alright until one fateful night.It seems Johnson's nemesis Plasse has been planning revenge on him for quite awhile.With his mother dead he has assumed a new identity and has hired a substantial group of real baddies to assist him.That night they jump Carrey at his group's lair,and decapitate him.They then track down another member of the gang,trash her home in the burbs and attempt to rape her.The cops come in swiftly but all are disposed of just as fast.That night the police track down Johnson's home address and arrest his father,thinking it is Kick Ass they have.While in jail Plasse has his father killed and sends a message to Johnson showing him the pictures.At his father's funeral,Plasse and his gang kidnap Johnson.Moretz is there and,while knocked unconscious during the initial assault,is now up and at them and on the roof of the van.All along Johnson has been pleading with her to come back into the super hero fold but she has refused.This,it seems,is the kick start she needed to return.She rescues Johnson and together,with the help of the core gang and many more recruits,storm Plasse's home for the final show down.The bad guys have their butts handed to them,while nemesis Plasse falls into a shark tank.Initially he thinks he's alright,but soon he goes under and the water turns blood red.The end has Moretz leaving the city as she has become a wanted fugitive.She hands the super hero torch over to Johnson who continues to train in earnest.In the post end credits there is a brief shot of Plasse in a hospital bed with his legs eaten off,trying to reach a bottle of water.Sequel anyone?This film concentrates far too much on Moretz's personal crisis and demands of her guardian to act""normal"".She cannot and will never fit in to that environment as that was made plainly clear from the first film.It is the fatal flaw of the film,as they fall back on an old literary device seen in a gazillion films prior to this,but which doesn't belong in this one.The film also has a tendency to flit all over the place and sometimes cannot connect it successfully altogether.Carrey plays a subdued(for him)role and is SO subdued he just doesn't stand out over anyone else.Or is that a case of alot of editing along the way? You decide.The big thing about the first one was Moretz's unbelievable moves.In this film we see her in very small moments throughout the film doing her thing.It is not until the final showdown do we see her doing anything substantial and even then,between cutaways,there is barely over an actual minute of screen time devoted to her fighting.VERY disappointing.Finally,if I heard it once I hear it a gazillion times by various characters in this film,that""this is not a comic book,this is real life"".My gosh,talk about preaching to the audience.Hey producers,try using a hammer next time,it would be much more subtle!Technically speaking the film is in its original w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include some extended scenes,three featurettes and commentary.All in all a disappointing come down from the first.The script writers shoot themselves in the foot with some old literary canard that has no business in this film and Moretz's fantastic moves from the first are whittled down to precious little.Note to producers:have your writers watch and re watch the first film to find out exactly what made it tick,then and only then,have them write a new and hopefully better and more fitting script.This franchise's core idea is just too good to fritter away on bad writing.P.S.Jim Carrey gets the condescending disingenuous butt award for his comments post Kick Ass 2.He applies for and gets the part,then the script,films the movie,gets paid and when it comes out he issues a statement saying something to the effect that he does not condone the violence this picture portrays and does not support it.I am starting to see the end of your career road Jim,and there's a sign saying ""Unemployed"" there.Go figure.",3,Not as good as the original- 3-3 1/2

1627551,A2A1HXFSAPA9A5,B00BEIYH1A,S. Der,"[4, 14]","I really had high hopes for this movie. I saw it on the very first day it came out, after waiting half a year for it to come out. I loved the first movie and watched it over and over again. Then, finally, it came out and I saw it. What a let down!!!The movie tried so hard to be as good as the first, but it doesn't even come close to it. It could be that in this movie their was a different director than the first and I do believe that played a big part in it's failure. I thought the movie had a pretty good story to it, but the scenes on how it was done was bad. The jokes were not as good as the first movie either. Also, the acting was really done badly because I think the director didn't help them bring out their skills well.What did I not like about the movie? First thing, I didn't like was that they keep on showing Big Daddy's costume over and over again. I think I saw it 4 or 5 times in the whole movie! What the point was the point in showing me that costume so many times?  I thought they were going to somehow get again person to use it or maybe Kick-Ass would put it on or something. But, nothing ever happened. It was so dumb that they did that. If the point was to make the audience remember Big Daddy or show that Hit Girl still cares a lot of about her dad wishes, well I got that after seeing it the first time. That was done and done, no need for anymore of those useless scenes. Also, Kick-Ass did put on black body armor at the end, but that wasn't Big Daddy suit to me. Why? Because Bid Daddy suit is different! His belt says ""BD"", Kick Ass's belt says ""KA"". Daddy's wear all black suit. Kick Ass's wear's green and yellow! Mask? BD is all black, guess what, did Kick Ass wear a Black Mask? No, he did not! So, what do we have here? All Kick Ass did was put on any old body armor and that's supposed to be BD suit? I say, HELL NO! If so, then, you're saying we really needed to see BD suit 4 or 5 times just to see Kick Ass put on body armor. It is genius - NOT!The second thing I didn't like. Why did they have to kill off Jim Carrey""s character, Colonel Stars and Stripes, so soon? If you wanted to do a moment like having Big Daddy characters die like in the first, they should had done it right. When he died it was towards the end and people really liked him a lot at that point but having him died made the movie move forward. Colonel Stars and Stripes didn't needed to die so soon, he could had lived and the message could had still moved the story forward. Up to that point, Colonel Stars and Stripes was the best thing in the movie, and then, he was just gone! I believe the audience really was confused and lost, just as much as the characters in the movie were. Then, I lost much interest in the movie.The third thing I didn't like. Naming the Super Villains in the movie stupid or racist names. No, it not that funny. Not even a tiny bit. It just dumb what they did. They wanted to force a laugh out of people, but people have to be really low in intelligence to get that kind of humor.

Our bad guy (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) has taken on a name not worth repeating. He has started his own league of criminals.The film is let down. Kick-Ass has taken on the looks and persona of Harold Ramis. The film is filled with awkward swearing, i.e. lines read by people who don't know how to swear. The Justice League of misfits should have been a solid spoof, but instead was written rather lame.The film had potential.

With such unforgettable characters as Hit-Girl and Big Daddy, the film was meant to be shocking and entertaining at the same time, whether you like it or not. And perhaps most importantly, Matthew Vaughn&#8217;s (dark) action comedy is based on a one-time-only premise about an ordinary high school boy turning into a self-appointed crime-fighting hero.Now, after three years Kick-Ass (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Hit-Girl (Chlo Grace Moretz) come back. So does vengeful Chris D'Amico (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) from the original, formerly known as Red Mist, who becomes a super-villain (and his new name cannot be written here). Some new characters are introduced and among them Olga Kurkulina&#8217;s Mother Russia is very impressive, almost stealing the show.Unfortunately, the filmmakers failed to come up with an interesting story. The idea of Mindy Macready or Hit-Girl trying to fit in a high school does not interest me simply because the result is too obvious. The same can be said about the vigilante group led by Colonel Stars and Stripes (Jim Carrey with a special make-up), which Dave Lizewski or Kick-Ass joins in.Not that &#8220;Kick-Ass 2&#8221; is a terrible film.

Of course when I heard that due to the success of the film the writers of the original story went to write a second graphic novel, that says a lot. There was no doubt that a film would soon follow based on the new material and now we have Kick-Ass 2...which I am sorry to say does not pack the punch that the first one does.I don't know why but in this new installment I just found everything about it to be forced. The on screen chemistry of the characters doesn't work as well as they did before. The whole Mean Girls element involving Hit-Girl in high school is pretty dumb. The worst part is Christopher Mintz-Plasse is such a whiny little annoyance in this film and makes a terrible super villain. Even the parts that I thought would be high notes to redeem the film ended up being mediocre at best. The biggest let down for me had to be Jim Carrey, the trailer really over-hypes his character and in the film he really doesn't come off as what I anticipated him to be. Kick-Ass himself doesn't really seem to be as great a presence as he was in the first film and neither does Hit-Girl. John Leguazamo on the other had did a great job in this film. Known for being a goofy comedy star, he really put on his big-boy pants with a more fatherly character to the main villain and I really liked that.As far as I am concerned this was such a horrible let down.

The same issues with this action vs. storytelling aspect stood out with recent big-budget films like The Dark Knight Rises, The Avengers, and Thor.It did not have the novelty of the first film nor the shock factor to the highest level of its predecessor but it still sufficed with some humanity in the film with Hit Girl's alternative, high school life and Kick-Ass' troubles with his father. The Hit Girl character is strongly represented here that the film could've almost been called, ""Hit Girl: A Spin-off of Kick-A**"" (an issue apparent with Cars 2 where it focused too much on Tow Mater than the others).Aside from that, Kick-A** 2 suffers a bit from standing out and timing but it is all an acceptable effort on a more commercialised sequel and makes for fun yet painful viewing with beer and crisps after a football game.""*PARENTAL WARNING: In regards to the violence, it is just as graphic, sadistic, extreme, and potentially disturbing as the first film but to a slightly less degree given the novelty of the first (no one expected a 11-12 year old girl could kill or curse like that) and excess promotion of Hit Girl as now a cult pop culture icon, in a way. Along with the irony, dark humour, and normalcy of the frequent brutality as well as strong foul language (including the f and c-words), this film is in no way suitable for children especially given the ages or youthfulness of the main characters and stylistic, sensationalistic violence involved. The 15 certificate in Britain was not well deserved, in my opinion, and like its predecessor should've been an 18 due to the violence and themes as one. The filmmakers, from how I perceive it, wanted to make it 15-ish enough by skimming on bloodshed a bit and detail to make it more available to teenagers (who are the target audience for comic books, in which the true Kick-Ass source material is slightly more graphic and disturbing than the films).

They waste so many minutes on having Hit Girl worry over her place with her guardian, EVEN THOUGH her father made her promise to be Hit Girl.  Pretty stupid, because Hit Girl would not care.  She's the real deal.  I'm not paying to see the life of a weak teenager.The second problem with this movie is Colonel Stars and Stripes' short time in the film.  He was the absolute best character in the movie.  He's in and out too quickly.  So is his incredible dog.The third big dump this movie takes is NOT USING John Leguizamo as a villain!!!!!  What . . . the . . .?  His star never gets to shine.  How could you mess that up?  I would have LOVED to see what kind of villain this character would have become.  In fact, they also gave up a developing comedic relief dynamic by getting rid of him.  Dumb, dumb move.Other than those three complaints, I have nothing but good to say about this movie.  Why?  Because the other characters are fun, funny, and unique.  The action is way better than the first movie.  The scenes are fun re-watch.  Just great stuff.  Mother Russia vs. Hit Girl.  All I am gonna say.  :)If you loved the first, BUY it.  If you liked the first, rent it.  Either way, it is definitely a better movie than the first.

Kick-Ass 2 may not be as good as the first, but it is still pretty damn good for a sequel! Lots of laugh-out-loud moments along with plenty of good fight scenes as well. Chloe Grace Mortez, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, and Jim Carrey all nail their roles and steal just about every scene they are in. Although, I did think Carrey was underused and would've liked to see more of him. The film does become a bit too cartoonish and a bit inconsistent, but I was having so much fun watching it didn't take that much enjoyment out of it.
