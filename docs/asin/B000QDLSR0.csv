Like I've said before; Just another tactic used by the studios to raise the MSRP (""Ooh, but it's a 7-disc set, so it must be worth $100!""). Gimme a break! Not only is HD DVD competing with Blu-ray (the better of the two), but unless BOTH formats start offering content at a more attractive price-point, the new high-definition media is going to fall right on it's face.

1074985,A3DGB4HN3QCGAL,B000QDLSR0,A. Burchfield,"[0, 0]","Very inventive, very confusing (lots of hanging threads left unexplained- for later season(s) maybe?) but I still think possibly the best of the new shows from the 2006/2007 season. The look of the show, the attention to detail- there's much more here than most series have to offer. I always took it as a sort of introduction prior to future adventures, some of the material confusing but mostly making sense by season's end.If you did happen to miss seeing most or all of the series you definitely won't be getting a comedy here, you will get action and a little horror- it's almost worth watching for the special effects alone. I think Claire, the cheerleader, died at least 8 times this season- Hayden Panetierre had some of the best scenes and lines in the episodes.The deleted scenes don't usually add much, it's obvious why they were cut- to fit the time slot better. The packaging makes a big deal out of the unaired pilot, I'll bet well over half of it was used in the first broadcast episode (and a bit in episode 4). The network was probably afraid of offending a certain ethnic group when they had it cut- it's interesting but not much to miss. There's a DL scene at the end of it that appears to have been part of another scrapped episode, it doesn't even go with the ""pilot"".I haven't tried the commentaries so I don't know how ""good"" they are but the extra's are worthwhile, I enjoyed seeing how the time freeze scenes are created and the cartoonist's background bit. It would have been nice to see more of the effects stuff explained but maybe I'm wanting too much.The set is worth owning and I can't wait to see what Season Two will be like.",4,Maybe the best new program of the '06/ '07 season,1189987200,"09 17, 2007",2007,1658,"['Very', 'inventive', 'very', 'confusing', 'lots', 'hanging', 'threads', 'left', 'unexplained-', 'later', 'season', 'maybe', 'still', 'think', 'possibly', 'best', 'new', 'shows', '2006/2007', 'season', 'look', 'show', 'attention', 'detail-', 'much', 'more', 'here', 'most', 'series', 'have', 'offer', 'always', 'took', 'sort', 'introduction', 'prior', 'future', 'adventures', 'material', 'confusing', 'mostly', 'making', 'sense', 'season', 'end.If', 'did', 'happen', 'miss', 'seeing', 'most', 'series', 'definitely', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'getting', 'comedy', 'here', 'will', 'get', 'action', 'little', 'horror-', 'almost', 'worth', 'watching', 'special', 'effects', 'alone', 'think', 'Claire', 'cheerleader', 'died', 'least', '8', 'times', 'season-', 'Hayden', 'Panetierre', 'had', 'best', 'scenes', 'lines', 'episodes.The', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'add', 'much', 'obvious', 'why', 'were', 'cut-', 'fit', 'time', 'slot', 'better', 'packaging', 'big', 'deal', 'unaired', 'pilot', ""'ll"", 'bet', 'well', 'half', 'was', 'used', 'first', 'broadcast', 'episode', 'bit', '4', 'network', 'was', 'probably', 'afraid', 'offending', 'certain', 'ethnic', 'group', 'when', 'had', 'interesting', 'not', 'much', 'miss', 'DL', 'scene', 'end', 'have', 'been', 'part', 'scrapped', 'episode', ""n't"", 'even', 'go', 'pilot', '.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'tried', 'commentaries', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'good', 'are', 'extra', 'are', 'worthwhile', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'how', 'time', 'freeze', 'scenes', 'are', 'created', 'cartoonist', 'background', 'bit', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'more', 'effects', 'stuff', 'explained', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'wanting', 'too', 'much.The', 'set', 'worth', 'owning', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'Season', 'Two', 'will', 'be']",Heroes: Season 1

Fortunately, the show also has a distinct sense of humor that counter-balances some of the heavy-handedness.I can see how some viewers may find Hiro and Ando annoying, but to me they were fun.  Though the show does meander, the writers do a commendable job staying consistent in terms of tone and continuity.  There are numerous beats in early episodes that pay off late in the season.  And the entire season works well as a complete story with each character following a distinct arc.The show really hits its stride after the ""Homecoming"" episode, which essentially marks the midpoint of the season.

Nikki Sanders has a spli-personality, one half is bad-ass, and she must learn how to control it. Claire, a high school cheerleader, is able to heal any injury, which she must keep secret from everyone around her. Sylar, the mysterious villain of the show, also has an interesting backstory. But the best character of all is Hiro Nakamura, a goofy office worker who can teleport and bend time (but he has trouble controlling it). Over the season, the heroes gather to try to stop the New York explosion.

Its characters are empty shells, puppets being strung around by the cliche-ridden plot.It certainly knows its comic-book roots (how can it not, with names like Tim Kring and Jeff Loeb), but it's done with the widest possible audience in mind, and hence dumbed down to an unbelievable degree.Granted, ""24"" isn't particularly intelligent in terms of its plots either. But ""24"" is mindless, edge of your seat entertainment that keeps you glued to the screen with its snappy politics, frenetic pace, and cliffhanger endings, not to mention a strong central character (go, Jack, go!) None of that is present in ""Heroes"". Nothing to make up for the shallow characterizations and stupid scripts. The pace is numbingly slow, and it's hard to care for the majority of the characters. Hiro is the only exception, actually, seeming genuinely surprised at the discovery of powers, unlike the others, who kind of take them for granted. Hiro has opinions and ideas, while others seem predetermined in what they have to do.For example, Ali Larter is very one-dimensional, which is ironic, considering her character has split personality. Her face blank, she delivers lines of dialogue as if regurgitating them. All the scenes with her come to a screeching halt.Same with Mohinder. My favorite line was something I read on EW.com: he is ""Mohindering the action"". That guy truly represents ""Heroes""' pointlessly talky progression (if one can call it that).We have seen it all before: the end of the world coming, heroes uniting against the ultimate evil, blah blah blah... And it COULD have worked, if the characters weren't so utterly boring.I encourage the fans of this show to please read Alan Moore's ""Watchmen"", or Neil Gaiman's ""Sandman"", or Frank Miller, Grant Morrison, Rick Veitch, Brian K. Vaughan, Bill Willingham... the list goes on, but pick any of those books or writers, and you will get a much more fulfilling experience than ""Heroes"" offers. They are truly 'adult' graphic novels, not struggling teeny glossy shows with bad special effects, a languid pace, forced twists and turns, and silly catchphrases, like that 'Save the Cheerleader' one...I have to apologize - I realize I have been rambling in this review. But skimming through all the 5-star responses to the show, it just makes me sad. Is this as good as it can get, really? Are our expectations so low?

1074997,A2JUR4XQAHSXT6,B000QDLSR0,Amazon Customer,"[10, 32]","Heros is a strange series to  get into and it is best viewed as a series on DVD.  The first three episodes are hard to follow. The show tries to focus on all the major protagonists and antagonists at once.  Since you do not know who the heros and who the villians are this gets confusing.  After all the action tends to sputter in starts and stops all threw season one. You have to wait untill later on in the series until the stories start to come together.  Once this happens the show picks up its pace anad becomes much more streamlined. Until that happens you find yourself being frustrated by the bits and pieces the show gives you.Unlike LOST or THE 4400, Heros has a hard time focusing on the major players and tries to show us too much without revealing anything.  The mystery and suspense of the story does not build smoothly.  It is almost as if the writter, director, and producer suffer from ADHD or ADA.  Instead of knitting the players together the show puts them on several different paths at once.  This would have worked wonderfully as a book but as a weekly t.v. series . . . Well like I said this is best viewed on DVD as a series.As for the actors.  This is a cast that you have problems identifying with.  The main ""scientist"" character, an Indian professor, looks dirty and worn threw the entire season.  Unlike Said for say  Lost, this person has no charisma.  Without any screen presence you find yourself actually rooting for the bad guys to hurry up and kill him.  The same is true for several other characters with two notable exceptions.  The Japanese character and the American Cheerleader.  Both are well developed and have tapped into the zeitgeist of our sub culture.Once again Heroes should have taken a lesson from Lost or Star Gate and used familliar actors (or battle tested actors and actresses) from other Sci-Fi shows.  By having a veteran Sci-Fi actor or actress, even as a cameo, the acting bar would have been raised and the cast would have been forced to develope faster.We shall see how things devlope in season two but for now the show has a lot to overcome.  right now the show is a good show.  Deepending upon how the writters and director perform in season two will determine if the show becomes great.Live Well:David",3,like it or hate it,1183852800,"07 8, 2007",2007,2265,"['Heros', 'strange', 'series', 'get', 'best', 'viewed', 'series', 'DVD', 'first', 'three', 'episodes', 'are', 'hard', 'follow', 'show', 'focus', 'major', 'protagonists', 'antagonists', 'once', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'who', 'heros', 'who', 'villians', 'are', 'confusing', 'action', 'sputter', 'starts', 'threw', 'season', 'one', 'have', 'wait', 'untill', 'later', 'series', 'stories', 'start', 'come', 'together', 'Once', 'show', 'up', 'pace', 'anad', 'much', 'more', 'streamlined', 'find', 'being', 'frustrated', 'bits', 'show', 'you.Unlike', 'LOST', 'THE', '4400', 'Heros', 'hard', 'time', 'focusing', 'major', 'players', 'tries', 'show', 'too', 'much', 'revealing', 'anything', 'mystery', 'suspense', 'story', 'not', 'build', 'smoothly', 'almost', 'writter', 'director', 'producer', 'suffer', 'ADHD', 'ADA', 'Instead', 'knitting', 'players', 'together', 'show', 'several', 'different', 'paths', 'once', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'wonderfully', 'book', 'weekly', 't.v', 'series', 'said', 'best', 'viewed', 'DVD', 'series.As', 'actors', 'cast', 'have', 'problems', 'identifying', 'main', 'scientist', 'character', 'Indian', 'professor', 'dirty', 'worn', 'threw', 'entire', 'season', 'Unlike', 'Said', 'say', 'Lost', 'person', 'charisma', 'screen', 'presence', 'find', 'actually', 'rooting', 'bad', 'guys', 'hurry', 'up', 'kill', 'same', 'true', 'several', 'other', 'characters', 'two', 'notable', 'exceptions', 'Japanese', 'character', 'American', 'Cheerleader', 'are', 'well', 'developed', 'have', 'tapped', 'zeitgeist', 'sub', 'culture.Once', 'again', 'Heroes', 'should', 'have', 'taken', 'lesson', 'Lost', 'Star', 'Gate', 'used', 'familliar', 'actors', 'battle', 'tested', 'actors', 'actresses', 'other', 'Sci-Fi', 'shows', 'having', 'veteran', 'Sci-Fi', 'actor', 'actress', 'even', 'cameo', 'acting', 'bar', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'raised', 'cast', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'forced', 'develope', 'faster.We', 'shall', 'see', 'how', 'things', 'devlope', 'season', 'two', 'now', 'show', 'lot', 'overcome', 'right', 'now', 'show', 'good', 'show', 'Deepending', 'how', 'writters', 'director', 'perform', 'season', 'two', 'will', 'determine', 'show', 'great.Live', 'Well', 'David']",Heroes: Season 1
1074998,A30O8BV3UG5YTO,B000QDLSR0,Amazon Customer,"[1, 1]","My son was the one that started watching this series, I am more or less along for the ride.  BUT, since I'm paying for the Amazon account, here's my two cents worth.Each season is treated as if it's a chapter in a ... well, a super hero comic.  Something major is going on and at least that main item will be resolved by the end of the season.  (that's a good thing, as they don't overly drag out major plots before they wear out their welcome.).Structurally, think a Soap Opera tied to A comic book (mainly dark, very X-manish...  Hero's on the outs, being hunted, that sort of thing).  Hero's... well, their powers are very &#34;convenient&#34;, there are a few throw away characters, but for the most part the powers of the characters HAVE to be that way or the  plot doesn't progress.So, you get the complexity of a Soap, where a lot of the characters are connected but don't really know it, coupled with the powers that make each of them distinct.  So, a lot of the &#34;fun&#34; to me is figuring out how the pieces of the characters fit together and where the heck the plot is going.There's a decent amount to like here, good humor, decent action, hateable villains, that sort of thing.There's a lot where you groan, &#34;Oh why did they do something that stupid...  Really?  this character decided to go darkside on everyone because of that?!?  OMG they can't be serious...&#34;Most annoying part to the whole thing is a lot of it winds up being sub-titled because several of  the  characters speak limited English.  It does give it an interesting flavor, but gets past being annoying after awhile.The boy is into the last season and although there's a lot of &#34;They did what?&#34; moments in it, he continues to enjoy it and I haven't thrown anything at the TV while it's on, so there's that.So, if you don't mind a decent amount of stupidity, and some reasonably gross scenes (One of the villains likes to cut off the top of people's head and poke around in their brains with his finger (gains their powers that way)).It can and is a decent amount of fun.Would I watch it myself if I wasn't a parental captive?

I am from the u.k and I loved this series, although the plot went slightly skew in the middle quarter the momentum that built toward the climax was superb even if the ending was only an eight out of ten. Ali Larter is superb, and I found her and sylar  to be the best characters on the show. But to be honest I loved everybody aprt from..... Hiro! Yes I sound evil but I didn't like his character at all. He was comic relief at first but then he seemed to irritate me a lot. I hope they up the ante for this show in season two, although I think Sylar should have died I think keeping him alive speaks of a lack of creative ideas for season two. Lets have a fresh baddy with the bogey man that is mentioned toward the end of this season.

1075004,A1534MBU6VJXYN,B000QDLSR0,"Anthony Nasti ""Tony""","[0, 0]","In a day and age where television is dominated by mindless trifle, a show like ""Heroes"" is, to borrow from the title of one its exciting chapters, a Godsend. Thanks to an excellent team of writers and a top notch ensemble cast, ""Heroes"" takes a cliched and dated concept (""Ordinary people with extraordinary powers"" - like that hasn't been done before) and breathes new life into it with suspenseful storylines and well developed characters.The 23 episodes of the first season of ""Heroes"" give us an in-depth view of the show's central characters, and what a diverse assortment of characters there are. At the core of this cast of normal people with abnormal characteristics is Claire Bennett (Hayden Panettiere), a seemingly ordinary Texas cheerleader who has the ability to heal herself from any wound. There's Nathan Petrelli (Adrian Pasdar), a New York congressional candidate with the power to take to the skies at any given moment, and his brother Peter (Milo Ventimiglia), a male nurse with the ability to absorb the abilites of his fellow heroes. Comic book artist Isaac Mendez (Santiago Cabrera) hs the ability to paint future events before they can occur, while Asian cubicle dweller Hiro Nakimura (Masi Oka) can penetrate the space-time continuum. Cop Matt Parkman (Greg Grunberg) can  And of course there's Niki Sanders (Ali Larter), a broke Vegas housewife whose husband (Leonard Roberts) is fugitive and whose alter ego, Jessica, is becoming a burden, to say the least. Oh, and there's a brain stealing serial killer named Sylar (a brilliant Zachary Quinto) targeting the Heroes.All of these characters (and a few more) seemingly have nothing to with each other, but slowly become intertwined with each other as the show progresses. As the story developes, so do the characters, and the development is excellent. As the show progresses, it's not hard to develope a certain sympathy or level of relatability to each of the characters. You feel for the characters, empathize with them, fear for their lives.The writing on the show is excellent. Each episode has a good amount of well crafted twists and turns imbued with healthy doses of humor, occasional romance, and a good deal of excitement. The special effects and stunts for the show are just as impressive as the writing and acting.As I've mentioned, the performances on the show are universally excellent. Hayden Panettiere stands head and shoulders above most of Hollywood's crop of teen starletts by imbuing Claire with a legitimate amount of depth and believability. Even though she comes out okay, you still worry for her anyway. Masi Oka is fantastic as Hiro. Hiro in many ways is the show's comic relief, a fish out of water in the classic sense, and Masi portrays it to a T. Ventimiglia and Pasdar, as brothers in name only, play off each other quite well and the chemistry between them is really felt when they are onscreen together. Quinto makes for an amazing villian, turning Sylar into a modern Hannibal Lecter. And Ali Larter does an excellent job conveying duel personalities. Also of note is renowned character actor Jack Coleman, who plays Claire's adoptive father. Though without powers, he is for a good half of the season the most intriguing character. His motives are questionable, and you are often left wandering what side he's really playing for.The dvd set is loaded with a wealth of extras, none of which I have watched yet. But watch the episodes before anything.

1075015,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000QDLSR0,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[2, 2]","Geeky. Convoluted. Funny. Horrifying. Dramatic. Action-packed. All of these descriptors are appropriate for HEROES season one, which is why it became an immediate favorite by TV watchers all over the world. Television creator/writer Tim Kring is well known in prime-time circles with such things as CROSSING JORDAN andPROVIDENCEto his credit. But Heroes is something new even for Kring. He has jumped, nay, dashed, headlong into the fantasy realm.There are some common themes running through Heroes that make it a four star rating rather than five. Dark and conflicted superheroes are well-known to comic book and graphic novel fans.SPIDER-MANhad to battle his own dark side, as didSUPERMANand many others.THE HULKis just a pi$$ed-off green guy who has to learn to control his anger and is aided by love. Such are several themes within Heroes (for instance the Niki/Jessica character's love for her son Micah; and Nathan Petrelli's battle with the good and evil that surrounds him). From this standpoint, there's not a lot of fresh meat on its bones.Where it succeeds (and overwhelmingly so) is in its characters. They are particularly well cast with each person ""living"" that fictional person's life. Claire Bennett (played by Hayden Panettiere,THE DUST FACTORY) is a wonderful person that all audience members must cheer for. She's a cheerleader who can regenerate her damaged body. Fire. Radiation. Falls from fifty story buildings. Nothing can permanently injure her (or can it?).Nathan Petrelli (played by Adrian Pasdar) is the penultimate politician, trying to win his congressional district while at the same time attempting to hide his special ability. He can fly and his brother Peter believes he can too. Nathan tries in vain to talk Peter out of discovering his super abilities, but more surprises await Peter than could ever be imagined.Niki Sanders (played by Ali Larter) has something terrible inside her. She battles with this ""evil"" twin while at the same time trying to protect her equally gifted son Micah (Noah Gray-Cabey,LADY IN THE WATER).Isaac Mendez (played by Santiago Cabrera) is a junky artist who can paint the future. And when he paints the obliteration of New York City, he soon finds himself the interest of a unique company of people designed to find these gifted men and women.Any series wouldn't be complete without a villain, and Sylar (Zachary Quinto,24) is definitely that. Initially just a simple watchmaker/repairman, Sylar finds that he can steal the powers of the gifted and use it as his own ...but only after dissecting their brains.This review definitely wouldn't be complete without mentioning the wheels that keep this thing turning, and that is Hiro Nakamura (Masi Oka, BALLS OF FURY). He and his sidekick Ando (James Kyson Lee) infuse almost all of the much needed comic relief into the series. One of my favorite banters between them was, Hiro: ""My only concern is should I hide my true identity? A costume maybe?"" Ando: ""You start talking about capes and tights and I'm out of here.""A truly fun series to watch, and something for everyone, even those that don't like comic books, superheroes, or fantasy.",4,Something For Everyone,1191888000,"10 9, 2007",2007,3153,"['Geeky', 'Convoluted', 'Funny', 'Horrifying', 'Dramatic', 'Action-packed', 'descriptors', 'are', 'appropriate', 'HEROES', 'season', 'one', 'why', 'became', 'immediate', 'favorite', 'TV', 'watchers', 'world', 'Television', 'creator/writer', 'Tim', 'Kring', 'well', 'known', 'prime-time', 'circles', 'such', 'things', 'CROSSING', 'JORDAN', 'credit', 'Heroes', 'something', 'new', 'even', 'Kring', 'jumped', 'nay', 'dashed', 'headlong', 'fantasy', 'are', 'common', 'themes', 'running', 'Heroes', 'make', 'four', 'star', 'rating', 'rather', 'five', 'Dark', 'conflicted', 'superheroes', 'are', 'well-known', 'comic', 'book', 'graphic', 'novel', 'fans.SPIDER-MANhad', 'battle', 'own', 'dark', 'side', 'didSUPERMANand', 'many', 'others.THE', 'HULKis', 'just', 'pi', 'ed-off', 'green', 'guy', 'who', 'learn', 'control', 'anger', 'aided', 'love', 'Such', 'are', 'several', 'themes', 'Heroes', 'instance', 'Niki/Jessica', 'character', 'love', 'son', 'Micah', 'Nathan', 'Petrelli', 'battle', 'good', 'evil', 'standpoint', 'not', 'lot', 'fresh', 'meat', 'bones.Where', 'overwhelmingly', 'so', 'characters', 'are', 'particularly', 'well', 'cast', 'person', 'living', 'fictional', 'person', 'life', 'Claire', 'Bennett', 'played', 'Hayden', 'Panettiere', 'THE', 'DUST', 'FACTORY', 'wonderful', 'person', 'audience', 'members', 'must', 'cheer', 'cheerleader', 'who', 'can', 'regenerate', 'damaged', 'body', 'Fire', 'Radiation', 'Falls', 'fifty', 'story', 'buildings', 'Nothing', 'can', 'permanently', 'injure', 'can', '.Nathan', 'Petrelli', 'played', 'Adrian', 'Pasdar', 'penultimate', 'politician', 'trying', 'win', 'congressional', 'district', 'same', 'time', 'attempting', 'hide', 'special', 'ability', 'can', 'fly', 'brother', 'Peter', 'can', 'too', 'Nathan', 'vain', 'talk', 'Peter', 'discovering', 'super', 'abilities', 'more', 'surprises', 'await', 'Peter', 'could', 'ever', 'be', 'imagined.Niki', 'Sanders', 'played', 'Ali', 'Larter', 'something', 'terrible', 'evil', 'twin', 'same', 'time', 'trying', 'protect', 'equally', 'gifted', 'son', 'Micah', 'Noah', 'Gray-Cabey', 'LADY', 'IN', 'THE', 'WATER', '.Isaac', 'Mendez', 'played', 'Santiago', 'Cabrera', 'junky', 'artist', 'who', 'can', 'paint', 'future', 'when', 'obliteration', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'soon', 'interest', 'unique', 'company', 'people', 'designed', 'find', 'gifted', 'men', 'women.Any', 'series', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'complete', 'villain', 'Sylar', 'Zachary', 'Quinto,24', 'definitely', 'Initially', 'just', 'simple', 'watchmaker/repairman', 'Sylar', 'can', 'steal', 'powers', 'gifted', 'use', 'own', 'only', 'dissecting', 'brains.This', 'review', 'definitely', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'complete', 'mentioning', 'wheels', 'keep', 'thing', 'turning', 'Hiro', 'Nakamura', 'Masi', 'Oka', 'BALLS', 'OF', 'FURY', 'sidekick', 'Ando', 'James', 'Kyson', 'Lee', 'infuse', 'almost', 'much', 'needed', 'comic', 'relief', 'series', 'One', 'favorite', 'banters', 'was', 'Hiro', 'only', 'concern', 'should', 'hide', 'true', 'identity', 'costume', 'maybe', 'Ando', 'start', 'talking', 'capes', 'tights', ""'m"", 'here', 'truly', 'fun', 'series', 'watch', 'something', 'everyone', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'comic', 'books', 'superheroes', 'fantasy']",Heroes: Season 1

If you're looking for something that you can tune into and out of then this isn't the show for you.  If, however, you're looking for TV that is engaging, intriguing, and innovative then this is the show for you.My preferred activity is normally reading and I don't watch much TV because, frankly, I find most TV subpar.  Imagine my delight when I tuned into this show mostly out of curiosity and ended the season a diehard fan.  I never missed an episode and looked forward to each new one with great anticipation.  I give most of the credit for this to where I feel the credit is due: the writing.  The writers for this show did a masterful job of creating an involving story arc and in giving the viewer just enough information to keep him or her coming back for more.  Answers to various questions were carefully dolled out over the course of the season so that the viewer never feels frustrated by too little story dragged out over too much time.  The pacing of this season was, in a word, perfect.The other reason to devour this show is the characters and, in particular, the endearing and wonderful Hiro.  My favorite of the characters, Hiro exemplifies that childlike joy that some people possess when they discover they are particularly talented at something.  He provides comic relief without being too silly and his earnestness make him very lovable.  His faithful friend and sidekick Ando is certainly not to be overlooked either and these two make for a truly dynamic duo.  As far as complexity goes, my vote goes to Claire who starts out struggling with typical teenager desires and grows and develops over the course of the season until she is easily the most sympathetic character.Excellent writing and excellent characters would mean little without the acting to back them up, though, and this show has that in abundance.  All of the actors imbue their characters with life and believability so that even though the bulk of them are possessed of superhuman powers they still seem like the kind of people who could be your nextdoor neighbors.I simply can't say enough good things about this show.  I encourage everyone who enjoys really engaging, story and character driven, and thought-provoking television to watch this show.",5,What TV is meant to be,1185321600,"07 25, 2007",2007,2372,"['can', 'not', 'emphasize', 'enough', 'stellar', 'example', 'power', 'character', 'driven', 'TV', 'continuous', 'plotline', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'can', 'tune', 'then', ""n't"", 'show', 'however', ""'re"", 'looking', 'TV', 'engaging', 'intriguing', 'innovative', 'then', 'show', 'you.My', 'preferred', 'activity', 'normally', 'reading', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'much', 'TV', 'frankly', 'find', 'most', 'TV', 'subpar', 'Imagine', 'delight', 'when', 'tuned', 'show', 'mostly', 'curiosity', 'ended', 'season', 'diehard', 'fan', 'never', 'missed', 'episode', 'looked', 'forward', 'new', 'one', 'great', 'anticipation', 'give', 'most', 'credit', 'where', 'feel', 'credit', 'due', 'writing', 'writers', 'show', 'did', 'masterful', 'job', 'creating', 'involving', 'story', 'arc', 'giving', 'viewer', 'just', 'enough', 'information', 'keep', 'coming', 'back', 'more', 'Answers', 'various', 'questions', 'were', 'carefully', 'dolled', 'out', 'course', 'season', 'viewer', 'never', 'feels', 'frustrated', 'too', 'little', 'story', 'dragged', 'out', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'pacing', 'season', 'was', 'word', 'other', 'reason', 'devour', 'show', 'characters', 'particular', 'endearing', 'wonderful', 'Hiro', 'favorite', 'characters', 'Hiro', 'childlike', 'joy', 'people', 'possess', 'when', 'discover', 'are', 'particularly', 'talented', 'something', 'comic', 'relief', 'being', 'too', 'silly', 'earnestness', 'make', 'very', 'lovable', 'faithful', 'friend', 'sidekick', 'Ando', 'certainly', 'not', 'be', 'overlooked', 'two', 'make', 'truly', 'dynamic', 'duo', 'As', 'far', 'complexity', 'vote', 'Claire', 'who', 'out', 'struggling', 'typical', 'teenager', 'desires', 'grows', 'course', 'season', 'easily', 'most', 'sympathetic', 'character.Excellent', 'writing', 'excellent', 'characters', 'would', 'mean', 'little', 'acting', 'back', 'up', 'show', 'abundance', 'actors', 'imbue', 'characters', 'life', 'believability', 'so', 'even', 'bulk', 'are', 'possessed', 'superhuman', 'powers', 'still', 'seem', 'kind', 'people', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'nextdoor', 'neighbors.I', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'good', 'things', 'show', 'encourage', 'everyone', 'who', 'really', 'engaging', 'story', 'character', 'driven', 'thought-provoking', 'television', 'watch', 'show']",Heroes: Season 1

1075022,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B000QDLSR0,Caleb Williams,"[1, 2]","To fans of the show the title of my review is likely something that has stuck in their minds since they first heard it two years ago. It was the definitive tag line for a truly unique TV show with quite a familiar premise. Think the birth of X-Men crossed with real life, each mutant has just discovered their powers for the first time and the notion of mutants is unknown to the world. Taking that simple description would give you the basic idea of what the show's about, but it's much better and much more complicated than that.Season 1 is the dawning of a new evolutionary stage for humans, some are born with superpowers such as Flight, Invisibility and the ability to heal etc. The show follows a number of different people at different stages in the discovery process. Some have been familiar with their situation for a long time and have actually either come to embrace their discovered power or hate it. To some super strength would be a blessing, but to some it would be a true curse to the hero and their family. Of course with the good guys discovering their powers, Heroes season 1 has the ultimate bad guy who can steal the powers of others by devouring their brains.There are four main characters to this season along with a bunch of excellent supporting actors. The main four are Hiro Nakamura (Masi Oka), Peter Petrelli (Milo Ventimiglia), Sylar (Zachary Quinto) & Claire Bennett (Hayden Panettiere). There are quite a few different stories that intertwine to the ultimate season finale, so below is my brief description of the 4 main characters individual stories.Claire Bennett: In October 2006 she discovers that she has the ability of spontaneous regeneration after an accident that leads to the cutting of her hand and a few days later the cut completely disappearing. Completely freaked out by this, Claire starts to experiment with her new ability with the help of her classmate Zach. She continues with a number of self harming incidents that would show her the extent of her ability.Hiro Nakamura: One day while in his office cubicle, Hiro discovers he has the ability to manipulate time and space allowing him to stop time or teleport himself to any period and any location on Earth. He's a regular comic book nerd and becomes excited by his powers and along with his friend Ando seeks to become the Hero he's always dreamed of being.Peter Petrelli: He's the brother of Politician Nathan Petrelli (Ability to Fly) and Peter first discovers that he has the ability to fly. Being freaked out by this fact he tries to convince his brother Nathan who's more pre-occupied with his own political ambitions. Throughout the season Peter becomes aware that it's not the ability to fly that is his power, rather he has the ability to absorb the powers of others with which he has no control over. This leads to Peter absorbing a power that would ultimately bring together all other heroes in the ultimate climax.Sylar: He's been called by many external reviewers, magazines and TV shows as the most evil TV villain of the 21st century. That is truly no understatement as Sylar is possibly the most evil and intimidating person I've seen on TV in years. We ever truly come to know what Sylars initial ability is, but he does have the ability to steal other peoples powers by killing them and taking their brain. What he does with it, we have yet to find out. He's the man that not only are people scared of, but he becomes another primary catalyst in the finale build up.There are quite a few side characters and stories, which for this season I don't think they really had much of a point rather than to pass the time and help out here and there. I will say this, however and that is that season 1 really set in stone an amazing show that from start to finish is extremely enjoyable. The performance by Quinto as the villainous Sylar is just unbelievable and he's become a cult fan favourite, simply because of his complex and evil nature. I would highly recommend this show to anyone as the special effects are unmatched and the acting is top notch.",5,"Save The Chearleader, Save The World",1220054400,"08 30, 2008",2008,4067,"['fans', 'show', 'title', 'review', 'likely', 'something', 'stuck', 'minds', 'first', 'heard', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'definitive', 'tag', 'line', 'truly', 'unique', 'TV', 'show', 'familiar', 'premise', 'Think', 'birth', 'X-Men', 'crossed', 'real', 'life', 'mutant', 'just', 'discovered', 'powers', 'first', 'time', 'notion', 'mutants', 'unknown', 'world', 'Taking', 'simple', 'description', 'would', 'give', 'basic', 'idea', 'what', 'show', 'much', 'better', 'much', 'more', 'complicated', 'that.Season', '1', 'dawning', 'new', 'evolutionary', 'stage', 'humans', 'are', 'born', 'superpowers', 'such', 'Flight', 'Invisibility', 'ability', 'heal', 'etc', 'show', 'number', 'different', 'people', 'different', 'stages', 'discovery', 'process', 'have', 'been', 'familiar', 'situation', 'long', 'time', 'have', 'actually', 'either', 'come', 'embrace', 'discovered', 'power', 'hate', 'super', 'strength', 'would', 'be', 'blessing', 'would', 'be', 'true', 'curse', 'hero', 'family', 'course', 'good', 'guys', 'discovering', 'powers', 'Heroes', 'season', '1', 'ultimate', 'bad', 'guy', 'who', 'can', 'steal', 'powers', 'others', 'devouring', 'brains.There', 'are', 'four', 'main', 'characters', 'season', 'bunch', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'actors', 'main', 'four', 'are', 'Hiro', 'Nakamura', 'Masi', 'Oka', 'Peter', 'Petrelli', 'Milo', 'Ventimiglia', 'Sylar', 'Zachary', 'Quinto', 'Claire', 'Bennett', 'Hayden', 'Panettiere', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'different', 'stories', 'intertwine', 'ultimate', 'season', 'finale', 'so', 'brief', 'description', '4', 'main', 'characters', 'individual', 'stories.Claire', 'Bennett', 'October', '2006', 'ability', 'spontaneous', 'regeneration', 'accident', 'cutting', 'hand', 'few', 'days', 'later', 'cut', 'completely', 'disappearing', 'Completely', 'freaked', 'out', 'Claire', 'experiment', 'new', 'ability', 'help', 'classmate', 'Zach', 'number', 'self', 'harming', 'incidents', 'would', 'show', 'extent', 'ability.Hiro', 'Nakamura', 'One', 'day', 'office', 'cubicle', 'Hiro', 'ability', 'manipulate', 'time', 'space', 'allowing', 'stop', 'time', 'teleport', 'period', 'location', 'Earth', 'regular', 'comic', 'book', 'nerd', 'becomes', 'excited', 'powers', 'friend', 'Ando', 'become', 'Hero', 'always', 'dreamed', 'being.Peter', 'Petrelli', 'brother', 'Politician', 'Nathan', 'Petrelli', 'Ability', 'Fly', 'Peter', 'first', 'discovers', 'ability', 'fly', 'Being', 'freaked', 'out', 'fact', 'convince', 'brother', 'Nathan', 'who', 'more', 'pre-occupied', 'own', 'political', 'ambitions', 'season', 'Peter', 'aware', 'not', 'ability', 'fly', 'power', 'rather', 'ability', 'absorb', 'powers', 'others', 'control', 'over', 'Peter', 'absorbing', 'power', 'would', 'ultimately', 'bring', 'together', 'other', 'heroes', 'ultimate', 'climax.Sylar', 'been', 'called', 'many', 'external', 'reviewers', 'magazines', 'TV', 'shows', 'most', 'evil', 'TV', 'villain', '21st', 'century', 'truly', 'understatement', 'Sylar', 'possibly', 'most', 'evil', 'intimidating', 'person', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'TV', 'years', 'ever', 'truly', 'come', 'know', 'what', 'Sylars', 'initial', 'ability', 'have', 'ability', 'steal', 'other', 'peoples', 'powers', 'killing', 'taking', 'brain', 'What', 'have', 'yet', 'find', 'out', 'man', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'people', 'scared', 'primary', 'catalyst', 'finale', 'build', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'side', 'characters', 'stories', 'season', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'really', 'had', 'much', 'point', 'rather', 'pass', 'time', 'help', 'out', 'here', 'there', 'will', 'say', 'however', 'season', '1', 'really', 'set', 'stone', 'amazing', 'show', 'start', 'finish', 'extremely', 'enjoyable', 'performance', 'Quinto', 'villainous', 'Sylar', 'just', 'unbelievable', 'become', 'cult', 'fan', 'favourite', 'simply', 'complex', 'evil', 'nature', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'show', 'anyone', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'unmatched', 'acting', 'top', 'notch']",Heroes: Season 1

In the beginning... it was all about the movies (Chaplin, Keaton, Flynn etc.)... and then THE HONEYMOONERS and I LOVE LUCY... and then, for actors, being on a television show was taboo and low level career move... and then, over the last few years, the roles have reversed again.... with shows like Buffy, E.R., X-Files, Smallville, 24 and now HEROES. Production values and entertainment values have gone through the roof, showing us why staying at home, or more importantly, buying these season DVD sets the hottest thing since the tv dinner.With HEROES, and not unlike, the other shows I mentioned, with television series', adequate time is spent experiencing the characters lives and getting to know them. You become invested in them. You grieve when they grive. You laugh when they laugh. You mourn when they die. You become engrossed like no 90 to 120 minute movie can do. You can't keep from hitting the play another episode button... despite the hours you've already spent on your couch.Heroes is the ULTIMATE in bringing the effects of the cineplex to the television set. Not to mention, you get into the characters more than you ever will with Spiderman 1,2 or 3... or any Batman movie...The production value is through the roof. Great effects. Great transistions from plot point to plot point. The beauty of HEROES is that it's never dull and never formulaic. Unlike some shows that have a theme and every week there's a new dilemma to correct in 43 minutes, HEROES entertwines numerous dilemma's, blends them, hooks them, shatters them and brings it all into perspective as the season unfolds.HEROES is what entertainment is all about. At times frightening. At times funny. At times sad and always interesting.My only gripe comes with a disappointing finale, and the reason why I gave just 4 stars instead of 5. So much build up. So much expectation, and it seemed all crammed into 40 minutes and... well... hokey... and there were too many... well why didn't she do this, or why didn't he do that?

I had originally Netflixed this series to give it a go.  My standard allowance time for a show is 8 episodes.  I figure if you don't have me interested by then, you aren't going to.  Needless to say, I own the DVD for all three seasons.  Now, before anyone says I'm just a Heroes lemming that can only give a 5 star review, check out my reviews for the other two seasons.  They aren't 5 star.  This is, however, the only truly awesome season of the series.  I like the other two, but they are nowhere near as good as season one.  It just seemed fresh and not like anything else out there.  Granted, the main characters aren't as fleshed out as they could be, but I can get over it.  There is at least some progression as well.  They aren't the same at the end of the series as they are at the beginning.  Of the bunch, I could have done without the Niki/Jessica character.  She was the weakest of the bunch in my opinion.  Claire can be a bit annoying at times, but I guess I might be the same way if I got a power I didn't really want or didn't know why this was happening to me. Overall, this has a sense of wonder and freshness that is hard to come by in serialized drama.  There are a lot of good drama shows, but they all seem slightly different slants on the same thing.  This show they tried to take the ""normal"" and turn it on its ear.  The first season accomplished that, the other two a little less so.  Haven't seen season four yet, so I can't comment on that.

1075039,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000QDLSR0,"Cloud ""...""","[1, 2]","It's odd in that Heroes was probably the one new show of 2006-2007 season that I watched from start to finish, having not missed a single episode. Whereas other great shows like Friday Night Lights are critic-adored-yet-audience-deprived or the Nine which was cancelled prematurely, Heroes became a huge hit and a critical favorite. While it initially has some issues, the further the show continues the more confident it gets and while it might not have everyone's ideal finale, it was surely the capper to what's a pretty stellar first season.What would you do if you found out if you had a superpower? That's the basic for the start of the first season where ordinary people suddenly find they can do amazing abilities; from a regenerating cheerleader to a time-travelling Japanese desk worker to a mind-reading cop. But that doesn't mean that they will all use their power for good as some don't know what to do with it, others want to get rid of it and some might use it for something destructive, such as destroy half of New York. All of these stories interwine as they try to stop a major disaster.Heroes, like many other shows, as an ongoing arc throughout the entire season, making it feel like one gigantic story split over 23 episodes rather than a series of mini-stories a la CSI or Law and Order. This can be a problem since it might not have a lot of replay value but it also means you just get hooked faster. But luckily the writers know how to make individual episodes stand out, thanks to great drama (the entirely Claire-centric ""Company Man""), stellar cliffhangers and characters. But then this is still their first season so we have a case of them trying to do too much in one episode making it feel kind of scattered.One of the strongest aspects of the show, aside from the intrigue, are the characters who manage to be distinct without being one-note. Ali Larter is effective in switching personalities right in the same scene and Hayden Panettiere nails that ""wishing to be normal"" feeling when she knows she's not. However the obvious scene stealer is Masi Oka who initially starts out as overly enthusiastic and almost giddy but progresses as the show continues without it feeling forced or unexpectedly sudden. Then we also have Zachary Quinto who plays the season's main villain who has such creepiness and menace when he's around (although he was probably strangely more effective when he was obscured in shadow with a baseball cap on).In the day and age of TV shows on DVD, it's hard to get a stellar DVD package. Unlike Simpsons or 24 with multiple episode commentaries, most of them are kind of skimpy. Heroes thankfully has pretty solid bonuses with several commentaries, the original unaired pilot as well as some making-ofs as well as tons of deleted scenes. As for the commentaries, while it's kind of disappointing there isn't one for the suspenseful ""Homecoming"", they get more frequent as the season progresses and there is more variety rather than the same writer/director/actor combinations.With a great sense of pacing, well-written characters and cool superhero moments, it's sort of a show where you can find geekiness yet find something of substance at the same time. Might not be the absolute best show on TV, but it's probably one of the more consistently entertaining.",5,A very strong first season,1188345600,"08 29, 2007",2007,3315,"['odd', 'Heroes', 'was', 'probably', 'one', 'new', 'show', '2006-2007', 'season', 'watched', 'start', 'finish', 'having', 'not', 'missed', 'single', 'episode', 'other', 'great', 'shows', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'are', 'critic-adored-yet-audience-deprived', 'Nine', 'was', 'cancelled', 'prematurely', 'Heroes', 'became', 'huge', 'hit', 'critical', 'favorite', 'initially', 'issues', 'further', 'show', 'more', 'confident', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'everyone', 'ideal', 'finale', 'was', 'surely', 'capper', 'what', 'pretty', 'stellar', 'first', 'season.What', 'would', 'do', 'found', 'out', 'had', 'superpower', 'basic', 'start', 'first', 'season', 'where', 'ordinary', 'people', 'suddenly', 'find', 'can', 'do', 'amazing', 'abilities', 'regenerating', 'cheerleader', 'time-travelling', 'Japanese', 'desk', 'worker', 'mind-reading', 'cop', ""n't"", 'mean', 'will', 'use', 'power', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'others', 'want', 'get', 'rid', 'might', 'use', 'something', 'destructive', 'such', 'destroy', 'half', 'New', 'York', 'stories', 'interwine', 'try', 'stop', 'major', 'disaster.Heroes', 'many', 'other', 'shows', 'ongoing', 'arc', 'entire', 'season', 'making', 'feel', 'one', 'gigantic', 'story', 'split', '23', 'episodes', 'rather', 'series', 'mini-stories', 'la', 'CSI', 'Law', 'Order', 'can', 'be', 'problem', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'lot', 'replay', 'value', 'also', 'just', 'get', 'hooked', 'faster', 'luckily', 'writers', 'know', 'how', 'make', 'individual', 'episodes', 'stand', 'out', 'thanks', 'great', 'drama', 'entirely', 'Claire-centric', 'Company', 'Man', 'stellar', 'cliffhangers', 'characters', 'then', 'still', 'first', 'season', 'have', 'case', 'trying', 'do', 'too', 'much', 'one', 'episode', 'making', 'feel', 'kind', 'scattered.One', 'strongest', 'aspects', 'show', 'aside', 'intrigue', 'are', 'characters', 'who', 'manage', 'be', 'distinct', 'being', 'one-note', 'Ali', 'Larter', 'effective', 'switching', 'personalities', 'right', 'same', 'scene', 'Hayden', 'Panettiere', 'wishing', 'be', 'normal', 'feeling', 'when', 'not', 'However', 'obvious', 'scene', 'stealer', 'Masi', 'Oka', 'who', 'initially', 'out', 'overly', 'enthusiastic', 'almost', 'giddy', 'show', 'feeling', 'forced', 'unexpectedly', 'sudden', 'Then', 'also', 'have', 'Zachary', 'Quinto', 'who', 'season', 'main', 'villain', 'who', 'such', 'creepiness', 'menace', 'when', 'around', 'was', 'probably', 'strangely', 'more', 'effective', 'when', 'was', 'obscured', 'shadow', 'baseball', 'cap', '.In', 'day', 'age', 'TV', 'shows', 'DVD', 'hard', 'get', 'stellar', 'DVD', 'package', 'Simpsons', '24', 'multiple', 'episode', 'commentaries', 'most', 'are', 'kind', 'skimpy', 'Heroes', 'thankfully', 'pretty', 'solid', 'bonuses', 'several', 'commentaries', 'original', 'unaired', 'pilot', 'as', 'well', 'making-ofs', 'as', 'well', 'tons', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'commentaries', 'kind', 'disappointing', ""n't"", 'one', 'suspenseful', 'Homecoming', 'get', 'more', 'frequent', 'season', 'more', 'variety', 'rather', 'same', 'writer/director/actor', 'combinations.With', 'great', 'sense', 'pacing', 'well-written', 'characters', 'cool', 'superhero', 'moments', 'sort', 'show', 'where', 'can', 'find', 'geekiness', 'yet', 'find', 'something', 'substance', 'same', 'time', 'Might', 'not', 'be', 'absolute', 'best', 'show', 'TV', 'probably', 'one', 'more', 'consistently', 'entertaining']",Heroes: Season 1

As a result of the strike, an entire planned story line was cut from the show. This made the third season of the show a little choppy and denied the audience fitting story lines for a couple characters we'd developed some attachment to during the second season.The show features a story-arc style similar to that of a comic book.

1075052,A1KISYZSUGHL5P,B000QDLSR0,David Romano,"[5, 6]","I'll be picking up my boxed set this weekend, but really, I'm not buying this for the extras, although they need more mention.  This is just a review of the tv series from my PoV.  Total rating is 4.5 stars.This type of show really is character-driven as opposed to plot-driven; the point is to get to know these characters as opposed to doing a ""villian of the week"" show like ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"".  Yes, there was the plot device of ""New York City is in danger!"", but each week was really about the characters and getting to know them.  So that's my focus.  The characters were brilliantly played.  Unlike many fans of the show, I actually found Nathan and Nikki to be my faves.  Adrian Pasdar is an excellent and really underrated actor who brought a different side to the show.  While everyone was in love with Peter and Hiro's joy of being superpowered, and everyone related to the high school angst of Claire's outsider status, I think Nathan represented the adult whose life has just been given the major upheaval by, well, life. He was a needed character, and Adrian Pasdar was a great casting decision.  Nikki was an interesting twist as a character.  I like Ari Lightner, but I wasn't 100% sure what the character was all about.  Once I learned more about her, I really liked her.  The split personality worked for me, but I'm glad it got integrated by the end of the season.  And lest I forget, Matt.  Matt, to me, also made some very interesting decisions throughout the season, and I wonder what the fallout will be in September.  He took a turn which I dind't see coming, but am not surprised with.  It was needed to keep him interesting.  Hiro, Claire, Isaac, DL, Peter... they were all great characters.  Skylar was an excellent villian, and HRG was certainly a character who provided endless hours of speculation.  It's going to be interesting to see what the show does next season.  Are Peter and Nathan dead?  What about Ando now that Hiro is in feudal Japan?  Is Matt among the living?  Is Sylar alive?  And what about Kirsten Bell, Dania Ramirez, and Nichelle Nichols, all brilliant casting decision for characters to come.The camoes and guest characters provided some great plot development, especially for Matt... let's face it, telepaths are boring, so he needed a good story.  And Clea DuVall, one of the most underrated actresses around, gave it to him.  The Invisible Man, George Takei, Eden, and all the others served good purposes, weren't just cannon fodder, and I wanted them all to join the cast!Half a star deduction for:-the finale.  It was overall great, but it needed to be longer.  The ""climactic battle"" was anything but.  It reminded me of the bad flick that was ""Generation X"" staring Finola Hughes and based on the Marvel Comic of the same name.  It was really campy and hokey by the end.  I wanted it to be better.-The decision by NBC to ""unout"" Claire's buddy Zach, then write him off the show.  I see a lot of people pleased with the racially diverse cast, and I agree, but to have a fake myspace page for the kid listing him as ""questioning"" and then redo everyone's memories and make him straight then get rid of him was a very poor decision by NBC, IMO.  Gay kids deserve role models, too, you know.- They hype.  I think the fault really should be laid at the feet of the NBC PR crew.  THEY made the ads.  NBC missed the mark a few times with marketing.  Not the show.  But it does factor into my decion to give this a 4.5 star review marked by four instead of five stars.  The show needs to deliver, and there were times it didn't.  I loved the arcs, and ""Save the Cheerleader"", ""Are You on the List"" and the other marketing campaigns were great.  Except that they were usually a week or two ahead of the actual episode which was aired.Do I recommend this show, of course.  It's quality television.  Overall very well written and acted, and it's something you could sit down with the kids and watch without worry.  There were a few ""gross out"" scenes, usually involving Claire and Sylar, which may scare younger viewers, but it's something I'd let my niecesd and nephews watch.  Minimal swearing, not in-your-face, over the top and constant sexuality, simulated comic-book-esque violence make this a show for most viewers.Most of the 2006 season hasn't graduated.  Really, what are the real carry overs?  Oh, right, NBC's ""Heroes"" and ABC's ""Ugly Betty"".  That's really it.  For all the bad reviews of the show, the numbers and survivial and overall critical and fan acclaim speak for themselves.  And just because I can't resist, ignore the haters.  ""Lost"" fans are disgruntled because this season fell apart, and ""Battlestar Glactica"" fans are annoyed fanboys whose favorite show will never get picked up by a major network and they're just jealous of the commercial and critical success this show has pulled off.  ;)",4,Review of TV Series only,1188432000,"08 30, 2007",2007,4873,"[""'ll"", 'be', 'picking', 'up', 'boxed', 'set', 'weekend',

1075053,A3UUGZRTBS81YN,B000QDLSR0,David W. Jones,"[1, 2]","Heroes was one of the best shows on television when it first hit the air.  It is a character-driven piece about a group of seemingly ordinary yet extraordinary individuals who are disconnected from one another at first--the high school cheerleader who can regenerate; the LA cop who reads minds; the congressional candidate who can fly; and others with special abilities.  There is also the evil Sylar who is trying to steal their powers one-by-one so that he can be the most ""special"" of them all.  As the episodes unfold, these individuals find that their destinies are leading them together in order to save the world.Series creator Tim Kring has given us a new mythology.  In terms of philosphy and spirituality, the series does wrestle with some of the classic questions: Who am I?  How did I get here?  Why am I here?  What is wrong with the world?  The worldview is a bit muddled, however, with talk about random human evolution in some places, and then destiny (seemingly from a higher power) in others.  The show does not slow down long enough to sort these out.  Having multiple writers for each episode probably did not help.The blu-ray transfer is an upgrade from the DVD, yet it has some problems.  While most scenes have crisp detail and sharp colors, there are some that have noticeable film grain and/or digital noise.  The sound played well on my system.  If you want the best edition, this is it.  But it is not perfect.Parental Advisory: This show was made for broadcast television, so it stays within certain boundaries.  With that said, it does push those boundaries in some places.  There are brief, scattered scenes of sexuality, mild language, and drug abuse.  The most problematic piece is the violence and gore, including some frightening images, which occur at least once in every episode.  The serial killer Sylar dispatches his victims by cutting off the tops of their heads and removing their brains.  There are other scenes that involve fighting, torture and gore.  This series is not intended for pre-teens.Heroes Season One was one of the best shows on television at the time.  Sadly, the series lost its way in subsequent seasons.  But this first season retains its impact, particularly in the season climax.  I recommend it for those who love superhero movies, but those who are bit squeamish as well as those with sensitive consciences might want to keep the remote close by so you can fast forward through some of the more offensive scenes.",4,"Save the Cheerleader, Save the World",1355356800,"12 13, 2012",2012,2477,"['Heroes', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'television', 'when', 'first', 'hit', 'air', 'character-driven', 'piece', 'group', 'seemingly', 'ordinary', 'yet', 'extraordinary', 'individuals', 'who', 'are', 'disconnected', 'one', 'first', 'high', 'school', 'cheerleader', 'who', 'can', 'regenerate', 'LA', 'cop', 'who', 'minds', 'congressional', 'candidate', 'who', 'can', 'fly', 'others', 'special', 'abilities', 'also', 'evil', 'Sylar', 'who', 'trying', 'steal', 'powers', 'one-by-one', 'so', 'can', 'be', 'most', 'special', 'episodes', 'unfold', 'individuals', 'find', 'destinies', 'are', 'leading', 'together', 'order', 'save', 'world.Series', 'creator', 'Tim', 'Kring', 'given', 'new', 'mythology', 'terms', 'philosphy', 'spirituality', 'series', 'wrestle', 'classic', 'questions', 'Who', 'am', 'How', 'did', 'get', 'here', 'Why', 'am', 'here', 'What', 'wrong', 'world', 'worldview', 'bit', 'muddled', 'however', 'talk', 'random', 'human', 'evolution', 'places', 'then', 'destiny', 'seemingly', 'higher', 'power', 'others', 'show', 'not', 'slow', 'down', 'long', 'enough', 'sort', 'out', 'Having', 'multiple', 'writers', 'episode', 'probably', 'did', 'not', 'help.The', 'blu-ray', 'transfer', 'upgrade', 'DVD', 'yet', 'problems', 'most', 'scenes', 'have', 'crisp', 'detail', 'sharp', 'colors', 'are', 'have', 'noticeable', 'film', 'grain', 'digital', 'noise', 'sound', 'played', 'well', 'system', 'want', 'best', 'edition', 'not', 'perfect.Parental', 'Advisory', 'show', 'was', 'made', 'broadcast', 'television', 'certain', 'boundaries', 'said', 'push', 'boundaries', 'places', 'are', 'brief', 'scattered', 'scenes', 'sexuality', 'mild', 'language', 'drug', 'abuse', 'most', 'problematic', 'piece', 'violence', 'gore', 'including', 'frightening', 'images', 'occur', 'least', 'once', 'episode', 'serial', 'killer', 'Sylar', 'victims', 'cutting', 'off', 'tops', 'heads', 'removing', 'brains', 'are', 'other', 'scenes', 'involve', 'fighting', 'torture', 'gore', 'series', 'not', 'intended', 'pre-teens.Heroes', 'Season', 'One', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'television', 'time', 'Sadly', 'series', 'lost', 'way', 'subsequent', 'seasons', 'first', 'season', 'impact', 'particularly', 'season', 'climax', 'recommend', 'who', 'love', 'superhero', 'movies', 'who', 'are', 'bit', 'squeamish', 'as', 'well', 'sensitive', 'consciences', 'might', 'want', 'keep', 'remote', 'close', 'can', 'fast', 'forward', 'more', 'offensive', 'scenes']",Heroes: Season 1

As to blu-ray quality, it was adequate and certainly beyond standard DVD quality but hardly the best I've seen.  My wife and I did not watch this show first time around even though everyone we knew was raving about it.  Now that we've completed the first season, we agree we won't bother with the second and third.  It is notable that almost no one we know is talking about the show now.The series is well made, well acted, and has some interesting premises. We both found it laborious and so complicated as to detract from the viewing experience.  In fact, we finished the season with the attitude of we've gotten this far, let's finish it.  There were too many characters, each of which tried to out-weird the one before it, and the time shifts and character changes didn't help clarify anything.

The character backgrounds are SO cliche - the only thing unique about them is their super abilities which they all (except for Hiro and Sylar) hate about themselves and try to hide.  I mean, come on - have they never watched a sci-fi movie or read a comic book? You have super powers!  You've hit the jackpot! It was like watching a daytime soap opera shot on film.  These characters take themselves too seriously (I understand that they are all in a dire situations, but the only character with any sort of joy in his heart is Hiro - it's all just depressing.)  Everything they say is either totally emo or annoyingly philosophical.The basic plot was fine, but I hated Mohinder Suresh's character like I've never hated any other character on TV and when Sendhil Ramamurthy and Nora Zehetner came on screen, their terrible acting powers combined to make probably the WORST scenes on prime time.  Overall, there are very few characters I actually like.  Hiro, Ando and Hiro's Dad are about it (and why do they have to speak in Japanese, but everyone in India speaks English?)  Everyone else drives me crazy.  Sylar may be one of the most obnoxiously played supervillans I've seen in a long time.  What a horrible season finale - no surprise that it was terrible, but what could have been a redeeming final episode just dropped the ball.The episodes drag by so slowly.  One thing I will give them is that they do a good job with cliff hangers.  You sit and watch for 35 minutes and just when it finally starts to get a little bit interesting, they cut you off and you want to watch the next episode (which always starts off pretty good and then is mind numbingly dreary until the last 10 minutes.)Let's face it, the real reason we're all watching is because we're waiting for it to turn into ""X-Men, The TV Series.""  (Sylar = Mr. Sinister; Claire = Wolverine, X-23; Issac= Destiny [she writes, he paints.. she writes in her diaries and the X-Men try to find those diaries to prevent the horrible predictions from becoming truth... sound familiar?];Hiro = Cable, Gateway, Magik; Peter= Mimic, Synch; Mohinder = Moira McTaggart; The Haitian = Leech; Candice = Mastermind; Claire's Mom = Pyro; Ted = Havok, Skullfire; Micah = Forge; Linderman = Elixir, etc.)I keep watching and waiting and hating it, with a hope deep inside my heart that it will get better and that it will redeem itself and become a good plot AND character driven show and that the actors will eventually get better.  I must say - we received this set as a gift, and it's much easier to watch each episode back to back than it is otherwise.I want to like this show so much, but they make it very hard.

And what if you could use it to save the world?Superheroes are everywhere in entertainment, from comic books to movies. But few manage to be as intelligent, geeky and well-written as ""Heroes,"" a solid comic-book style TV series that explores the repercussions of several ""ordinary"" people who discover that they have strange -- and sometimes dangerous -- powers.It opens with Mohinder Suresh (Sendhil Ramamurthy) reflecting on the human quest for knowledge -- even knowledge that we shouldn't have -- right before learning that his father has been killed, possibly murdered. Suresh's dad believed that ""special"" people were cropping up, much like in X-Men.And we are introduced to the ""heroes"": stripper Niki (Ali Larter) harbors a secret dark side, cheerleader Claire (Hayden Panettiere) heals from any injury, Japanese Dilbert Hiro (Masi Oka) can bend time and space, Senatorial candidate Nathan (Adrian Pasdar) is able to fly, his brother Peter (Milo Ventimiglia) can copy others' powers, a cop Matt (Greg Grunberg) can read minds, and junkie artist Isaac (Santiago Cabrera) sees the future. There are plenty of others that show up, but these start the ball rolling.While Claire and Hiro explore the potential of their new powers, Niki and her son try to elude some hired thugs --and end up overwhelmed by her dark side, and framed. And Suresh searches for the answer to his father's death, only to find that his genetics research is involved with the ""special people,"" and that a superpowered serial killer is targeting them.Even worse, Hiro takes a trip to New York (five weeks in the future), and sees the city destroyed by a massive blast -- as does Isaac, through his paintings. How to stop it? As a future Hiro tells them, ""save the cheerleader, save the world."" The Heroes begin slowly coming into contact, in a haze of dreams, visions, murder, swords and death -- and to stop the serial killer and save New York, more sacrifices may be made...Unlike most shows about people with superpowers, ""Heroes"" isn't really about the action or flashy battles. It's half epic save-the-world-as-a-team story, and half exploration of how real, ordinary people would react if they suddenly found out that they had superpowers, and how this would change -- or NOT change -- their lives.The storylines are incredibly intricate and complex, since there are a dozen subplots and a lot of time travel, and plenty of hints at future events. The careful painting of all these storylines even further in two episodes, one of which shows the pre-Heroic lies of the characters (and how Syler became a murderous terror), and another that shows what the future will be like if they don't change it. It's not a pretty picture.These complex storylines are enhanced by lots of suspense and tightly directed action, and the makers always know how to throw in a shocking twist, such as a sword-carrying future Hiro showing up.. But there is also some poignancy, and very dark humor from time to time (Claire waking up in mid-autopsy, or twisting her broken neck around). Not to mention some great, sometimes geeky dialogue (""Where did you learn all this?"" ""X-men No. 143 when Kitty Pryde time travels!"").The actors are pretty much all good -- Larter gives a great double performance, Zachary Quinto is a wonderfully twisted villain, and Panettiere gives a good performance as a teen whose adolescence has a lot more than hormones in store. Masi Oka is the standout, though -- his Hiro is sweet, endearing, geeky, heroic, sad, kindly, funny and thoroughly lovable. The scene where he arrives in New York is adorable.The ""Heroes"" are only starting their journey, and the first season of this geeky hit is a must-see for fans of intelligent sci-fi drama.

Morris ""Backroads""","[6, 9]","While I was a considerable Heroes nut during the first season's original tv airing, I was open to the possibility that I might only be excited over something new and different, and I cautiously took my own enthusiasm with a grain of salt.  However, even greater appreciation the second time around has to mean something.I do not believe this is just fad, this show.  By all critiques I could put out, it's fantastic.  It follows a rather classic idea of comic-book superheroes with mutant powers.  Yes, it's been done before, but there is nothing wrong with doing it again and having it work--just recognize that it has its own twist through keeping its little mutants as normal and human as possible.They cover a broad group of people:  a stressed teenager, a single mother, an average joe cop, a university professor, etc.  Yet no one ever becomes a stereotype (though the show, on occasion, playfully brings them in).  They all have their own, considerably normal, storylines and very human desires.  These are people with whom we can relate.Then, of course, we toss in the fantasy/superhero angle.  Another fresh blend of superpowers and ominous foreshadowing of world destruction.  Great, fun stuff.  Among the challenges of pregnant wives, dead fathers, and boys there is an intruding single plot that draws in everything else.  It's clever, classic, and wonderfully spooky.But thankfully the show never takes itself too seriously.  Fortunately it is so seemingly ordinary that it's hard to get too wacky or cheesy.  I find myself laughing during the most suspenseful scenes due to subtle, witty humor.All of these gather together in an incredible emotion that is never forced, but still keeps you feeling strongly for all of these characters and what they are going through.  It plays out almost like a comic book (indeed, the comics are a common theme), and this is what keeps me addictively hooked on each episode.Now to the DVD set itself.  It's probably one of the most gorgeous boxes I have ever held, and the bonus features simply rock.  I appreciate the documentaries on stunts and special effects.  Oddly enough, they add an extra emotional aspect (from the perspective of the creative artists) that make me appreciate the story all the more.It's funny, tender, exciting, and overpowering in so many ways.  It is primarily a story of people who care for one another.

Instead of superheros with superpowers dressing up in tights to save the world, Heroes features a bunch of ordinary citizens who have superpowers - and face the consequences. These characters each have unique powers and each copes with the powers in his or her unique way. The show had a lot of potential for character development and moral allegory.I think the show partly succeeds in the former. Some of the characters become quite interesting and unique. However, unfortunately, too many of the characters are too milquetoast. It's as if in not wanting to make the characters comic book superheroes the show makes them boring. I think this was the wrong direction. Too many of these characters would have been interchangeable with your average soap opera character with little difference, except for the flying, electricity, etc.Where the show really disappointed me is the story. There was a lot of potential, but the writers chose to go with the usual tropes of 1) a secret corporate conspiracy, 2) a psychopathic villain, and 3) a plot to blow up New York City. I for one am sick of these. In recent years it seems like most sci-fi shows have adopted one or both of these tropes. Few of the episodes provide particularly thoughtful plots. I didn't ever find myself thinking that the show raised a particularly interesting or novel moral issue. Too bad.Heroes does have strong production value and acting. It does a decent job tempting you to keep watching until the next episode, usually through excellent use of cliffhangers. However, after watching an episode, it all seems like a blur rather than something that will stay with me for the rest of my life.Overall, I'd give it 3.5 stars.

Frankly, the opening to the series is pretty boring...a lofty question about ""why are we here?""  As much as I love philosophizing over those things, drama is visual and demands action.  The pilot should have begun with the scene of the Japanese guy squeezing his eyes shut and stopping the second hand of his clock.  What a dramatic beginning that makes you want to know more that's going on.  Instead the show begins with two guys in India jabbering on about some dramatic work someone's father did that needed to be finished.  Shows should excite you in a way which make you want to put in the next DVD to see what happens next.  You should be grabbed from the beginning.  It shouldn't just make you wait to see what happens next.  After some point, people stop waiting.I contrast this with Smallville's pilot.  It had a very, very dramatic beginnig.  The town of Smallville is hit by a meteor shower from Clark's spaceship arriving to Earth which frightens everyone.  That very premise made for a strong and creative series the whole way through the show.  The show, without a doubt, has excellent writers.Heroes is probably one of those storylines that has to unravel versus having you leaning on the edge of your seat.

NBC took some serious risks this season with a number of innovative and groundbreaking shows.  No gamble, however, could have been more unlikely a success story than was their pilot for ""Heroes.""Because of its comic book, episodic nature, Heroes might have fared better starting off as a miniseries or ""event"" playing two episodes several nights in a row to get its audience past an unusually long introductory period where an audience is still trying to identify numerous characters over a not-very-clear plot line.  Nonetheless, those who stuck with it were rewarded with one of the most satisfying network series debuts since the ""24.""The ""Heroes"" include a shapeshifter, a Japanese worker who has mastered moving through the time space continuum, a cheerleader who can recover from any injury - including death, a mindreading cop, an invisible man, a dual-personality stripper with the ultimate good/evil split, a man who can walk through solid objects, a child who communicates with machines, a heroin addicted artist whose paints the future of the world, a politician with the ability to fly and his younger brother who absorbs the powers of every other hero.  There are more to explore and each adds unexpected nuance and richness - as well as endless possibilities - to the story.All of these people have been tracked down during a lifelong study by a professor from India forced to abandon his family and move to New York for the final part of his research:  contact.  When he's mysteriously killed, his estranged and embittered son, through a series of intense epiphanies, bedraggedly becomes involved in discovering who these extraordinary people are and the reason for their existence.With more plot twists, turns and confusion than a night at the Chinese Opera, ""Heroes"" manages a balancing act of ancient grand guignal theatre, action/adventure, combined with all in an epic both .  In the best ""bad guy"" tradition, ""Heroes"" offers up villains that, on the surface, seem little more than scenery chewing cardboard cartoon characters - but ah, get to know them, and they are multi-faceted,The very best entertainments draw you into another world, are able to create a feeling that engages your imagination and, even in their darkness, beckons the viewer to stay and explore.  I do not know any show that has done this better than have the creators of ""Heroes.""What is most remarkable about this large cast of characters is their very ordinariness.  In the very best superhero tradition, each lives an ordinary, mundane existence and when confronted with their extraordinary abilities, must figure out a balancing act to incorporate these abilities into a normal existence.  This, of course, ultimately proves impossible and the deeper reasons for why they are they way they are emerge, eventually bringing all together to prevent - or cause - a catastrophic event that will destroy or save the world.While the entire ensemble of actors provide uniformly satisfying performances, there are, several standout performances:  Masi Oka, as the unlikely ""Hiro"" - our endearing time traveler who (literally) comes straight from the pages of a comic book learning, ungracefully, how to bend time and space to accomplish his mission.  Hayden Panettiere as ""Claire"" the indescructable cheerleader who, despite her amazing abilities must be ""saved""; Milo Ventimiglia as ""Peter"" - the confused, soft spoken nurse to whom is given the great task:  ""Save the cheerleader, save the world.""  Then there is Zachary Quinto as ""Sylar"" the darkly handsome brainsucker and ultimate boogeyman.  But again, trust me, singling out these particular heroes in no way diminishes the potency and brilliance of the rest of the cast - all integral to the telling of this most amazing tale.""Heroes"" debut season ended - quite literally - with a bang, and even just a peak into next season makes me hungry for more.

A teenaged cheerleader just trying to fit in. An Internet stripper struggling to raise her gifted son. An L.A. cop whose marriage is collapsing. And an artist strung out on heroin. All characters whose lives have just become extraordinary.NBC's HEROES engages in vicarious wish fulfillment and explores the fascinating nature of super powers and what it would be like to be gifted with amazing abilities. No surprise then that HEROES, premiering on September 25, 2006, quickly became one of the hottest new shows of 2006. While this show's big hook hinges on the superhero theme, HEROES doesn't come all heavy with the gaudy special effects. There are no costumes, no superhero code names (unless you count ""Flying Man!"" as a code name). Instead, HEROES focuses on down-to-earth storylines which ground the cast and the fantasy elements. The everyday settings and situations keep it all relatable. To pique interest, the episodes do end on a cliffhanger, and, on occasion, the show actually doles out answers to several of the ongoing mysteries.This is a humongous cast, and each actor steps up. Plenty of compelling characters here, but the breakouts seem to be: Hiro Nakamura, the sweetly nerdy and infectiously enthusiastic Japanese office drone, played by the cherubic Masi Oka; Claire Bennet (Hayden Panettiere), the invincible high school cheerleader; and the sexy, tortured Niki Sanders (Ali Larter, oh so sensuous). But also effective are Adrian Pasdar as the unflappable and coldly ambitious Nathan Petrelli and James Kyson Lee as Ando, Hiro's sidekick. One of the best things about the show is Lee and Oka's fun chemistry. As well, in Lee, the show provides us with a rootable point-of-view character. With the core roster being so large and varied, there are multiple story threads. But, man, do you get hooked with each one! The overriding story arc, involving an impending apocalypse in New York, manages to tie in all these subplots.Every show like this needs a good villain, and we are introduced to several candidates. Zachary Quinto (who does look like Spock) is the very scary boogeyman Sylar, a superpowered serial killer who hunts other gifted individuals and murders them to steal their talents. There's the mysterious Mr. Linderman, who seems to have his finger in every pie. My favorite bad guy, though, may be H.R.G. (Horn-Rimmed Glasses, aka Claire's dad), who, as the season progresses, develops into a fascinating, multi-layered character.So many things to like about HEROES. There's the obvious stuff, with the fan boy's dream of a premise. Then the well-rounded characters with whom you empathize, and their incredible powers. The writing, dabbling in the fantastic but rooted in reality, consistently sucks you in. Each episode forms a chapter in one encompassing narrative (so you can't really afford to miss one). The show drips with human drama, edge-of-your-couch suspense, stupendous action (when it crops up), and an overhanging sense of dread, of Armageddon being only one misstep away. It certainly engages in moral dilemmas, or, put another way: ""Is Peter Parker cheating when he sells photos of Spider-Man?"" Needless to say, the twists and turns, the shocks and revelations, when they surface, will stun you.HEROES creates an intricate internal mythology, all credit to series creator Tim Kring and his co-horts for some well-conceived world-building. And, as mentioned, HEROES doesn't go overboard with the f/x, but when the show does indulge in f/x, it does so with ridiculous flair. In particular, the stupendous injuries which Claire sustains are of the queasy variety. In particular, one character's power of prophesy adds a darker, even more dramatic dimension to the show, giving rise to the question: Is the future mutable? Props also to comic book artist Tim Sale, whose contributions cannot be overlooked.Finally, the high muck-a-mucks actually come thru with the special features, of which there's a walloping plentitude. To start with, HEROES - SEASON 1 offers cast and crew audio commentary on 13 episodes. This includes Tim Kring's thoughts on the unedited, semi-alternative version of the pilot ""Genesis,"" which offers up a deleted terrorism story arc. My favorite commentary, though, is on the awesome dystopian episode ""Five Years Later."" Amazingly, there are 50 deleted scenes. There's the 10-minute-long ""Making Of"" featurette, as well as segments on the show's stunts, special effects, and musical score. An interesting profile of color blind comic book artist Tim Sale (who rendered Isaac Mendez's paintings). And you can even play the freaky-cool ""Mind Reader"" game.Got nothing more to add, really. If you haven't yet, watch the dang show and get set to have your bump of curiousity nudged mightily. Oh, and pay the writers already, so Season 2 gets back from limbo.",5,"Save the cheerleader, save NBC.",1198886400,"12 29, 2007",2007,4947,"['sensitive', 'hospice', 'nurse', 'living', 'shadow',

All to the point that made me watch all discs (including the extras) in only one week after purchase, while most of times I take much more than this to view a box set entirely.Expectations for the second season (premiere date is just around the corner) are very high and Tim Kring (the creator of the show) will have a tough task for the next weeks to keep ourselves tuned into the next episodes. Is Sylar really dead? What ever happened to Peter and Nathan Petrell? Will Parkman survive to the shootings? What about the other heroes?Such elaborated plots are attractive while they can and I hope that it will last long.

""A show based on humans with superpowers?"" ""Hasn't this been done before?"" Well, yes; a new show created by producer and writer Tim Kring sees people all over the world discovering their newfound abilities in their own ways, more like X-Men for the common folk. Course with that being said, the characters are...well...common folk.With several interesting plots that only seem to compare to the 'The 4400' which bares the story of people who are genetically enhanced and sent time-travelling to a specific place in time to alter history, it's fair to say that Heroes does neither of this, or travel in any direction in any shape or form.The show itself has several interesting features that try to distinguish itself from other Sci-Fi orientated shows, with that in mind it plays along the lines of a comic book. It shoots in panoramic, comic book Neo-Dickenson visuals, all the while giving off a false sense of satisfaction. You don't feel hyped or excited by the scene, but a sense of need seems to surround it, a feeling of basic display and no colour; just to pass off a particular story section for the need to get to the next.Hard-pressed sardonic values lace the screen time, with great belligerence that encompasses each episode with it trying to rival hard hitting drama like '24' or the recently successful 'Lost'. The score is unimpressive and feels downtrodden. It seems to play on depression; the characters themselves are not worth invested time as they don't have anything to connect with an audience with. They play on simple domestic, mellow dramatic exertion and struggles, far too two dimensional and that's with a big fat '2'. The overall themes are asinine and very juvenile, some cases it tries to push that boundary but untimely falls back into the skim of things.With that also being said, the show has interesting CGI special effects the never really get the boot to amazing. The episodic structure fills the time with multiple story arcs of various characters; however it becomes a bit misconstrued as you seem to forget where the characters story left off when starting on a following episode. Some powers of the characters seem original, but focus is veered away on the idea on them dealing with a greater individuality and purpose on how they should face that fact that they are different; them adjusting, not on how they are different.The stories are so bleak that they become spread across multiple episodes for filler value and farther spread than tiny amounts of butter on toast. There is nothing to clench, no particular purpose when literally nothing happens in the episodes. True that like most realistic stories; usually nothing happens, but it seems to reinforce that belief further and further. The main problem is hype, or the constant overbearing need this show has to bare its need for audience. There are never enough questions, or any pondering, in fact in some cases you just don't care about ""Who killed who?"" or ""Why did he do that?""Verdict:Colourful, lacks visual beguilement, entertaining pop corn show, with a side order of dementia that you wouldn't mind having after each episode. Enjoy it while it lasts, savour it before it becomes tasteless. 7/10.",3,This so called 'Science Fiction' needs a lot of work.

The long term plot shows how homeland security and fear can be used for genocide and facism which you have to commend.  The execution of the story line, however, makes this show only mediocre.  It is hard to know where to begin with flaws.  One of the major let downs is the lack of action.  A story based on super powers has so much potential for interesting action, however, there is hardly any action in the show!  The fight scenes are always really, really short and cut away from showing the ""heroes"" actually use their super powers in interesting ways.Some of the actors really pull down the show.  Hayden Panetierre (the cheerleader) is awful!  She just cannot act, and since she is a major character it really negatively impacts the show.  It is painful to watch the totally unbelievable emotions on her face, and when she ""cries"" huge, fake Visine tears plop down her cheeks.  The actor who plays her father is also really limited, he does an ok creepy bad guy, but cannot show any other emotional range, and really struggles in the episode that features him.  The Indian scientist is also a bad actor.  He looks like an underwear model, and is totally unbelievable as a scientist.  The voice over narration they have him do is so retarded!  They try to make his narration sound really deep but it comes off as nonsense.  I guess they think that just because he has a British accent his narration will sound intelligent.Nicky, the character played by Ali Larter is totally stupid.  Larter is a good actor, but her super power is ridiculous - she has a split personality, the evil ""Jessica"" who she talks to in the mirror.  That's it!  They build up all these scenes around her mean evil twin who has super strength, but all they do is stare at each other in broken shards of glass or any reflective surface.  She doesn't connect in a meaningful way to the long term plot, and her scenes are quite boring as a result.The politician who can fly is one dimensional and never flies.  I could go on and on about the small flaws that all add up to a disappointing show that has so much potential!  The best character, and actor, is Hiro who can stop time.  He lights up every scene. But they have the subtitles in his scenes jump all around the screen which is completely distracting to the eyes.  They have a comic book theme to the show, so I guess they are trying to make the subtitles look like captions in a comic.  But it is already distracting for the eye to move between a subtitle and the characters, and when you don't know where on the screen the subtitle is going to appear it makes your eyes hurt.This show is definitely watchable, but you will find yourself irritated that it wasn't better executed.",3,"Great story, lacking in execution",1210723200,"05 14, 2008",2008,2810,"['Heroes', 'long', 'term', 'plot', 'lot', 'potential', 'be', 'intelligent', 'interesting', 'long', 'term', 'plot', 'how', 'homeland', 'security', 'fear', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'genocide', 'facism', 'have', 'commend', 'execution', 'story', 'line', 'however', 'show', 'only', 'mediocre', 'hard', 'know', 'where', 'begin', 'flaws', 'One', 'major', 'let', 'downs', 'lack', 'action', 'A', 'story', 'based', 'super', 'powers', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'interesting', 'action', 'however', 'hardly', 'action', 'show', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'always', 'really', 'really', 'short', 'cut', 'away', 'showing', 'heroes', 'actually', 'use', 'super', 'powers', 'interesting', 'ways.Some', 'actors', 'really', 'pull', 'down', 'show', 'Hayden', 'Panetierre', 'cheerleader', 'awful', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'act', 'major', 'character', 'really', 'negatively', 'show', 'painful', 'watch', 'totally', 'unbelievable', 'emotions', 'face', 'when', 'cries', 'huge', 'fake', 'Visine', 'tears', 'plop', 'down', 'cheeks', 'actor', 'who', 'father', 'also', 'really', 'limited', 'ok', 'creepy', 'bad', 'guy', 'can', 'not', 'show', 'other', 'emotional', 'range', 'really', 'struggles', 'episode', 'Indian', 'scientist', 'also', 'bad', 'actor', 'underwear', 'model', 'totally', 'unbelievable', 'scientist', 'voice', 'narration', 'have', 'do', 'so', 'retarded', 'try', 'make', 'narration', 'sound', 'really', 'deep', 'off', 'nonsense', 'guess', 'think', 'just', 'British', 'accent', 'narration', 'will', 'sound', 'intelligent.Nicky', 'character', 'played', 'Ali', 'Larter', 'totally', 'stupid', 'Larter', 'good', 'actor', 'super', 'power', 'ridiculous', 'split', 'personality', 'evil', 'Jessica', 'who', 'mirror', 'build', 'up', 'scenes', 'mean', 'evil', 'twin', 'who', 'super', 'strength', 'do', 'stare', 'other', 'broken', 'shards', 'glass', 'reflective', 'surface', ""n't"", 'connect', 'meaningful', 'way', 'long', 'term', 'plot', 'scenes', 'are', 'quite', 'boring', 'result.The', 'politician', 'who', 'can', 'fly', 'one', 'dimensional', 'never', 'flies', 'could', 'go', 'small', 'flaws', 'add', 'up', 'disappointing', 'show', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'best', 'character', 'actor', 'Hiro', 'who', 'can', 'stop', 'time', 'up', 'scene', 'have', 'subtitles', 'scenes', 'jump', 'screen', 'completely', 'distracting', 'eyes', 'have', 'comic', 'book', 'theme', 'show', 'guess', 'are', 'trying', 'make', 'subtitles', 'look', 'captions', 'comic', 'already', 'distracting', 'eye', 'move', 'subtitle', 'characters', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'screen', 'subtitle', 'going', 'appear', 'eyes', 'hurt.This', 'show', 'definitely', 'watchable', 'will', 'find', 'irritated', 'was', ""n't"", 'better', 'executed']",Heroes: Season 1

Not quite as bad as Jericho (which is awful, five minutes of story per episode, maximum!, and rightly canceled) but still quite annoying.  On such an otherwise good show, why create episodes in which barely anything happens for an entire hour?  Time filler, pure and simple-- and that is sad.  The hype and advertising are awful.  If I hear ""save the cheerleader, save the world"" one more time, I'll be forced to kill.  Heroes IS more like a comic book than any other network show I can think of.  Which is a good thing.

In fact, after the pilot episode I gave up, until this year when I caught season 3 episodes and it made me realize I've been missing an amazing show. So amazing I had to rent every Heroes DVD and request both seasons 1 & 2 dvd sets. I still wasn't crazy about the Pilot when I saw it again recently, but I loved the realistic approach to super-heroes.I'm a big fan of Smallville so no surprise Heroes won me over. There are lots of characters and many of them are very likeable. So many in fact that I can't pick ONE favorite because a lot of them are my favorites - like Hiro who can teleport through time and space and make me laugh every episode along with his human side-kick Ando, Claire Bennett who heals from anything like Wolverine, Peter (who could copy any powers of a super-human he comes into contact with) & Nathan (who can fly) brothers with powers, but different viewpoints, there's Matt the psychic cop/part time F.B.I agent who is trying to find out what happened to him and others like him who have suddenly become more than human. there's Nikki/Jennifer who are sisters one good and one bad, one dead  and one alive but they switch places when they ""see"" each other in mirrors and reflective objects, there's Angela Petrelli, the manipulative mother of the Petrelli brothers (Nathan and Peter), there's Mikah, Nikki's son who can control machines, there's DL the husband of Nikki and father of Mikah who can become intangible and walk through walls Finally, there is HRG the cunning, manipulative ""father"" of Claire and Sylar the show's version of Lex Luthor who kills to take other people's powers.. The stories are fantastic and in this first season this show brought a positive vibe that many tv shows lack these days (heck even Heroes has become a ""dark"" and brooding show).If you've never seen Heroes you don't know what you are missing. There are those fans that think the show has declined, but I think it gets better every week. I'm glad I finally started watching this show and now buy it on dvd. It's already become my favorite show. I suggest you rent it first but if you come to love it like I do you will not regret buying these dvds.

1075116,AQU2FAI5VKE91,B000QDLSR0,Jonathan Kim,"[0, 0]","""Heroes"" was THE freshest television experience of the 2006 fall schedule.  The ""heroes"" mentioned in the title are people who develop powers through a change in their genetic code, even manifesting itself in some way from parent to child.  While this phenomenon isn't really named in ""Heroes"", the powers reveal themselves in things like extremely fast regeneration, human flight, time travel, etc.  I think I would consider it more of a drama than science fiction because the dramatic elements drive the story and plot.  The powers of the characters just add that additional wow factor.Season 1 does much to introduce the viewer to the myriad collection of heroes.  It shows how a few of the characters are just freshly developing their powers while others have known about their powers for a while but don't yet understand their individual importance to the big picture.  Partway through the season, the show took a very ""X-Men:  Days of Future Past"" feel with Hiro traveling to a rather bleak future New York.  The introduction of dark, brooding Sylar as the first super villain to the franchise interjects some negative balance to the overwhelming number of ""good guys"".  This provides a turning point as our heroes start to run into each other with more purpose and guide the story towards its season 1 conclusion.Heroes is an excellent show with huge growth potential, but this is not to say that ""Heroes"" is not without fault.  The show occasionally loses focus because there are so many characters with different powers.  While these powers are incredible, it's hard to see how interesting it is within the plot.  Though it attempts to weave the characters across each others' paths, it sometimes feels too forced.  What are the odds of two of our heroes meeting each other in a random diner out in the desert?  Awfully seredipitous.  Also, I personally found the story line of Niki pretty uninteresting and almost irrelevant.  Even though I appreciate the dramatic elements, the inner nerd thinks the show's use of all the powers seems a little stingy.  I wanted to see more of Nathan's flying and even Sylar's powers rather than Claire mangling herself (We get it!  She can heal!) and Niki blacking out and waking up in a room with body parts everywhere.

Great pacing, tightly plotted with enough reveals with conceals, a satisfyiing story arc / season finale. Great casting! Lots of fresh faces along with lots of familar ones.The THEME: What if some everyday folks suddenly became superpowered in the ""real world?"" What if these people's origins, though seemingly random, were very much connected? And ""How do you stop a man from exploding (along with a bunch of NYC)?If you didn't see it there's alot more to it than those questions. Lots of drama, some cool effects and plenty of humor too.The 9th Wonders is a fictional comic that parallels the events of the characters in the series, partly because it's creator Isaac Mendez (SANTIAGO CABRERA)is an artist who can paint the future. This ability eventually joins these seemingly random group of heroes and villans together to resolve the fate of the city, and maybe, THE WORLD!The series won plenty of respect from NBC along with award from the likes of the American Film Institute for Best TV Program of the Year, Hollywood Foreign Press Association, a Golden Globe (for Best TV Drama), the Peoples Choice, and others.In fact, the NAACP acknowledged the series for its efforts, and well it should, the cast is amazingly diverse in race and gender(but science-fiction and fantasy has always been ahead of the game there).The archetypes roll out, but rarely take the obvious paths. Several character story threads are ultimately all entwined. Like that of Hiro Nakamura's lovable Japanese geek who can bend time & space (Masi Oka)and his powerless but loyal friend. Or Peter Petrelli (Milo Ventimiglia)the power-absorbing male nurse who may be the cause or the solution of the problems to be, and his flying politician brother (played by Adrian Pasdar or Top Gun & Profit). The brainy (but likable) Micah Sanders and his ""super"" disfuntional family, Niki, a mentally split super-assassin/super-stripper mom and the phazing ex-con dad. The invunerable Cheerleader Claire Bennet who's past and present has been puppetmastered by dark forces. The would-be police detective with mind-reading powers and young Dr. Suresh seeking not only to finish his father's work, finding these ""heroes,"" but stopping his father's killer. But who are the ""heroes"" and who are the villians? And what of the murderous watchmaker Sylar?In typical soap fashion, even the ugly characters are interesting to look at. Eric Roberts, Malcom McDowell and Zachary Quinto appear as baddies in this charter season. Other cameos include George Takei as Hiro's father.Watch for the 6 episode spinoff / filler series on NBC ""Heroes: Origins"" that will introduce a new superpowered character each week, viewers will select who makes it to the second season of Heroes.",5,MARVELous!

1075127,A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2,B000QDLSR0,"Kevin L. Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[1, 1]","Why can I not stop watching a series obviously based on comic books I read twenty years ago?  You'd think I'd object, but no.  This show's rather obvious debt to classics like ""The Watchmen"" and ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" almost makes me enjoy it more, since it brings so many influences together into a single, complex story line.  Perhaps it's the characters, or the storyline, or the excellent visuals.Rather than spit-polished superheroes, these characters seem like real people caught up in something they can't understand.  They don't just rush around putting wrongs to right; their mission seems almost an intrusion on concerns like paying the bills, holding down relationships, and getting ahead in the world.  Viewers can easily imagine ourselves sharing these same difficulties, and getting just as lost.Our ensemble pushes forward, knowing that if they pause, millions may die.  Yet they cannot agree between themselves what will cause this massacre, or even if it's a bad thing.  They can't identify the cause, and they can't agree on a villain.  Many of the characters never meet, as the ensemble pushes outward and inward, struggling to understand what they can do about the future, or even if they have one.Some bits of physical design ring hollow: Tokyo, for instance, seems to mainly consist of office cubicles and neon-lit alleys.  But these are the minority.  Most of this series is lushly designed, a treat for the eyes, from the locations and cityscapes, to the art, wardrobe, and ensemble scenes.  Many sets appear as intricately designed as most recent Hollywood movies, like the producers really care about how their show looks.Sure, some parts look way too familiar if you grew up reading funny-books, like me.  But it uses these recognizable building blocks to create stories and crises that really grab our attention, making us care about its events and whether its characters prevail.  Nowadays, when too many TV shows aim low and run with the easy answer, this one has enough character and fortitude to really stand on its own.",4,Engaging Revision,1294704000,"01 11, 2011",2011,2058,"['Why', 'can', 'not', 'stop', 'watching', 'series', 'obviously', 'based', 'comic', 'books', 'read', 'twenty', 'years', 'ago', ""'d"", 'think', ""'d"", 'object', 'show', 'rather', 'obvious', 'debt', 'classics', 'Watchmen', 'X-Men', 'Days', 'Future', 'Past', 'almost', 'enjoy', 'more', 'so', 'many', 'influences', 'together', 'single', 'complex', 'story', 'line', 'Perhaps', 'characters', 'storyline', 'excellent', 'visuals.Rather', 'spit-polished', 'superheroes', 'characters', 'seem', 'real', 'people', 'caught', 'up', 'something', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'rush', 'around', 'putting', 'wrongs', 'right', 'mission', 'almost', 'intrusion', 'concerns', 'paying', 'bills', 'holding', 'down', 'relationships', 'getting', 'ahead', 'world', 'Viewers', 'can', 'easily', 'imagine', 'sharing', 'same', 'difficulties', 'getting', 'just', 'lost.Our', 'ensemble', 'pushes', 'forward', 'knowing', 'pause', 'millions', 'may', 'die', 'can', 'not', 'agree', 'will', 'cause', 'massacre', 'even', 'bad', 'thing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'identify', 'cause', 'ca', ""n't"", 'agree', 'villain', 'Many', 'characters', 'never', 'meet', 'ensemble', 'pushes', 'outward', 'inward', 'struggling', 'understand', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'future', 'even', 'have', 'one.Some', 'bits', 'physical', 'design', 'ring', 'hollow', 'Tokyo', 'instance', 'mainly', 'consist', 'office', 'cubicles', 'neon-lit', 'alleys', 'are', 'minority', 'Most', 'series', 'lushly', 'designed', 'treat', 'eyes', 'locations', 'cityscapes', 'art', 'wardrobe', 'ensemble', 'scenes', 'Many', 'sets', 'appear', 'intricately', 'designed', 'most', 'recent', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'producers', 'really', 'care', 'how', 'show', 'looks.Sure', 'parts', 'look', 'way', 'too', 'familiar', 'grew', 'up', 'reading', 'funny-books', 'recognizable', 'building', 'blocks', 'create', 'stories', 'crises', 'really', 'attention', 'making', 'care', 'events', 'characters', 'prevail', 'Nowadays', 'when', 'too', 'many', 'TV', 'shows', 'aim', 'low', 'run', 'easy', 'answer', 'one', 'enough', 'character', 'fortitude', 'really', 'stand', 'own']",Heroes: Season 1

Would you use them for the benefit of mankind, or would you use them for your own objectives?  Heroes has become one of the biggest hit shows of the 2007 season, its conolation of well placed story plots intertwining the lives of several ""unique"" people has proven more than adequate and has dealt the viewer a hand of action, drama, comedy, and horror.The story takes off when Mohinder Suresh, the son of an obsessive scientist bent on finding the unique individuals who carry within them the genetic code capable of propelling our species to the next evolutionary stage, trying to finish his fathers research.  In the process the show dives into the individual stories of Claire, Nikki, Nathan, Peter, Isaac, Matt, and finally Hiro.  Claire has the ability to quickly regenerate her cellular structure rendering her invincible, Nikki is a stripper that has a hidden secret in her reflection, Nathan has the ability to fly, Peter can copy powers, Issac can reveal the future through painted portraits, Matt has the ability to read minds, and Hiro can break the space time continuom.*First Episode Spoiler Warning*For those of you that want to get an idea of what your in for before you buy the season set, i have decided to give a brief written summary of the beginning of the first episode, if you don't want to know what happens then do not read on.The episode basically begins with Peter standing on top of a 20 foot building looking out into the horizon, his arms spread open and the wind waving his hair he plunges off of the building and as he is speeding towards the ground you get a glimpse of Nathans face before the screen goes white and you are taken back to Peter who is now sitting on a chair with his nurse coat on apparently day dreaming.  After you get a small glimpse at what Peter's life is like, you are taken to Mohinder Suresh who is giving a lecture on the possibility of human potential and the idea that the most fully evolved creature is a cockaroach, while giving this lecture he is interrupted by one of his fathers old collegues who brings him the news of his father's death.  Mohinder then decides that he wants to finish his fathers research and so he takes a trip to his father's apartment to acquire clues on what his father was working on, while there, he finds that he is not alone, there is someone else who seems to be interested in his father's research as well.  Mohinder then takes a certain something from his fathers archives and leaves the room unnoticed.  Now you are taken to Claire who seems to be making some sort of a home movies considering she is being seen through the lens of a camera, Claire begins to climb about two stories onto the ledge of a construction site about 80 feet from ground level, the camera man utters something about how insane this is and then you see Claire plummeting two stories face first, the camera man begins to express his concern for her well being and begins to run towards her, Claire then gets up relocates her dislocated shoulder and says to the camera, ""attempt number 6,"" while a bloody gash over her forhead begins to disappear..............Want to know what happens next?

(At least, not yet.) The actors are generally good (many of them have played wonderful supporting roles in other hit shows).  The comics style for the X-men-esque genre is fresh.  The super powers are fun.  The villain is most definitely evil - he's black without hints of gray.  And our heroes have a glimpse of a future that they want to alter - a prophecy that ""destiny"" has given them a chance to change.  It is a recipe for a hit show, maybe even a great show.  BUT, it hasn't yet found a way into our hearts.  Does anybody actually CARE about these characters (barring sweet, sweet Hiro)?  I find that I wouldn't cry for them.  Or cheer for them.  Or sit on the edge of my seat and hope for them.  I do hope that this will change as the show grows - there were a few moments there in this season where I felt like the show could really be great.  Definitely keep this show on your radar!(I have to say that I admire the writers for tackling a show like this.  It seems to me that one of the dangers of a show where everyone has super powers is that once the audience has opened up their imaginations, they start to wonder things like, ""well, if he can fly, why doesn't he just do it?""  It's hard not to overthink the plots, and hard for us to believe that anyone with super powers and super friends might actually be in danger.

It was just so disappointing.The great thing about this show is:1. Multiracial Characters : All racial groups are represented in some form or the other. Multiracial identities are accepted and treated as normal, as they should be, obviously.2. Geographical Insight : I liked that we were shown Japan, Chennai (India) amongst other parts of the world through the series.3. Superpowers : Yes, none of the powers have truly blown us away yet, but what they've shown us so far is good for us all to hold on and watch moreHowever, all of these elements converge in the Season Finale to end up in one ridiculous and underwhelming piece of 'ensemble acting' that should be seen to be believed. I felt as if the makers of the show had worked so hard to take me along for the ride, but in the end it was one big lousy joke. I mean really. The 'Epilogue' to Season One was even more mind-numbing than what came before it.However, I must say that I found two of my favorite new actors on this show, and thats a blessing - Ali Larter (known outside the US for her work in India's ""Marigold""), and Sendhil Ramamurthy, who finally breaks the stereotype of the South Indian male in Western society. It doesn't hurt that these two look supermodel good either. The supporting cast is just fine, though instant celebs like Hayden Panetierre (Claire) and Zachary Quinto are vastly overrated.Heres the thing - I agree this is a wonderful show and I am buying the DVD set regardless. However, I am hoping that they don't lower their standards for the Season 2 Finale like they did here. A season finale is supposed to bring in the WOW factor, not put you to sleep or make you lose respect for the show. Thats what happened, in my opinion. They should watch 'Prison Break' - now THATS how a Season finale is done.Highly recommended, but they have got to step it up a notch in Season 2 or else this will end up like ""Invasion"", ""Surface"" and ""Threshold"" (of which ""Invasion"" was vastly superior to this, IMHO)",3,The One with the Terrific Opening and Pathetic Finale,1188432000,"08 30, 2007",2007,2102,"['Am', 'only', 'one', 'thought', 'makers', ""'Heroes"", 'totally', 'lost', 'time', 'came', 'Season', 'One', 'Finale', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'disappointing.The', 'great', 'thing', 'show', 'is:1', 'Multiracial', 'Characters', 'racial', 'groups', 'are', 'represented', 'form', 'other', 'Multiracial', 'identities', 'are', 'accepted', 'treated', 'normal', 'should', 'be', 'Geographical', 'Insight', 'liked', 'were', 'shown', 'Japan', 'Chennai', 'India', 'other', 'parts', 'world', 'series.3', 'Superpowers', 'Yes', 'none', 'powers', 'have', 'truly', 'blown', 'away', 'yet', 'what', ""'ve"", 'shown', 'so', 'far', 'good', 'hold', 'watch', 'moreHowever', 'elements', 'converge', 'Season', 'Finale', 'end', 'up', 'one', 'ridiculous', 'underwhelming', 'piece', ""'ensemble"", 'acting', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed', 'felt', 'makers', 'show', 'had', 'worked', 'so', 'hard', 'take', 'ride', 'end', 'was', 'one', 'big', 'lousy', 'joke', 'mean', 'really', ""'Epilogue"", 'Season', 'One', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'mind-numbing', 'what', 'came', 'before', 'it.However', 'must', 'say', 'found', 'two', 'favorite', 'new', 'actors', 'show', 'blessing', 'Ali', 'Larter', 'known', 'US', 'work', 'India', 'Marigold', 'Sendhil', 'Ramamurthy', 'who', 'finally', 'stereotype', 'South', 'Indian', 'male', 'Western', 'society', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'two', 'look', 'supermodel', 'good', 'either', 'supporting', 'cast', 'just', 'fine', 'instant', 'celebs', 'Hayden', 'Panetierre', 'Claire', 'Zachary', 'Quinto', 'are', 'vastly', 'thing', 'agree', 'wonderful', 'show', 'am', 'buying', 'DVD', 'set', 'regardless', 'However', 'am', 'hoping', 'do', ""n't"", 'lower', 'standards', 'Season', '2', 'Finale', 'did', 'here', 'A', 'season', 'finale', 'supposed', 'bring', 'WOW', 'factor', 'not', 'put', 'sleep', 'make', 'lose', 'respect', 'show', 'Thats', 'what', 'happened', 'opinion', 'should', 'watch', ""'Prison"", 'Break', 'now', 'THATS', 'how', 'Season', 'finale', 'done.Highly', 'recommended', 'have', 'got', 'step', 'up', 'notch', 'Season', '2', 'else', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'Invasion', 'Surface', 'Threshold', 'Invasion', 'was', 'vastly', 'superior', 'IMHO']",Heroes: Season 1

1075142,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B000QDLSR0,Mark Baker,"[7, 8]","Fall of 2006 saw the debut of many buzzed about shows.  Some went quietly away since they failed to catch the interest of the audience.  But a few caught on big time and took off.  Heroes was one of those shows.This is an ensemble drama with lots of different characters and storylines to follow.  As the series opens, ordinary humans begin to discover they have super powers.  There's Claire (Hayden Panettiere), a Texas cheerleader who can heal herself from any injury, even death.  In Los Angeles, cop Matt Parkman (Greg Grunberg) begins to hear the thoughts of everyone around him.  Niki Sanders (Ali Larter), Las Vegas stripper and single mom, has a Jekyll and Hyde like problem.  In Japan, cubical worker Hiro Nakamura (Masi Oka) discovers he can stop time and teleport.  Convinced he has these powers for a reason, he sets out with his best friend Ando (James Kyson Lee) on a quest.But things are really heating up in New York.  Senatorial candidate Nathan Petrelli (Adrian Pasdar) is trying to keep his ability to fly under wraps so he can win his election.  Meanwhile, his brother Peter (Milo Ventimiglia) seems to be able to absorb any power he is near.  And artist Isaac Mendez (Santiago Cabrera) can paint the future, but only when he is spaced out on drugs.  And his latest picture is of a nuclear bomb going off in New York City....Even this description just begins to scratch the surface.  There are conspiracies aplenty and a villain that must be stopped at all cost.  Other characters come and go as well, adding to the show.In fact, that's one thing that sets this show apart from others.  Not every main character is in every episode.  Only those needed appear.  And since most of the storylines run parallel for most of the series, just about every gets a break at some point.Yet the show is surprisingly engrossing.  It took me a couple episodes to be fully hooked, but once I was, there was no looking back.  I had to tune in each week for the next chapter in the saga.The show builds to a season climax that brings everyone together for a final battle.  Unfortunately, the season finale was very disappointing.  It was more confusing then it should have been and didn't tie up the things that they had been promising to do all season.

A little corny at times (which is nice) but overall a great achievement in directing, acting, casting, music and art direction. Especially for the network it's on. The series is a little slow at first till about episode 5 to do character introductions.  I break the season into 3 parts.  1 being introductions, 2 being more action with saving the cheerleader and 3 becoming darker when Sylar (Quinto= best villian on TV in a long time) gets into full effect and they have to try & stop a nuclear explosion.  I'm not going to get into other characters because they all have great stories to tell (nicki & parkman's are a little boring though until the end).  I'm a huge Lost & BSG fan and Heroes was fresh when the other 2 shows faltered just a little in the middle of their 3rd seasons.As a HD DVD set- this is the kind of set that makes me feel bad for people with bluray only players just as I can't get certain movies on HD that are on bluray.  It only makes me hate the format war even more.  Everyone should be able to enjoy the extras on this set.  The amount of extras and the way they are delivered are unbelievable.  I absolutely love the picture in picture feature for commentaries and the graffic art stuff.  Most of the picture quality is always super (8.5 of 10) while certain parts are reference quality (10 of 10).  And that's on a bigger screen so folks with 42"" or smaller HD sets will be watching an almost flawless picture.  I've read reviews that complained a little about the lack of surround effects in the series but it is not a major deal as I didn't find a problem with it.  When you listen to the DD+ through a really nice setup, you'll hear all the subtle effects.  Overall- another benchmark for extras on a TV set and amazing picture quality in HD.

For the reality grounded segment of the audience, the fantasy is never played up too strongly, and the characters are written in with more detail than you might expect - thanks in part to a largely unknown cast that never have you doubting.  For the graphic novel inclined, there are numerous nods to Graphic novel conventions, and bright primary colors to enjoy.As for the overall story arc, this scores over the likes of Lost by revealing the story a little faster, and having a satisfactory conclusion at the very end, albeit with a massive hook to keep you watching into the next series.  The story sags a little after the half way mark, but picks up again to finish on enough of a high to keep you watching.While the idea might seem to have a kid -friendly ethos to it, be warned, some of the violence is quite extreme, and due to the superpowers they have, the characters do things you certainly would not want your kids emulating.  In this sense the target audience is hard to figure out, as the storylines are somewhat light compared to the slew of quality TV programs coming out of the US recently, while what happens to the characters, in particular their demise, is edging into the realm of horror.  Having said that, one of the attractions of the series is that it does have cross generational appeal - just bear in mind the PG-13 certificate is warranted.Great cast, watchable story, and fast paced enough that interest does not flag.  8/10",4,Drama of `Lost' meets fantasy of `X-men',1202515200,"02 9, 2008",2008,1675,"['Heroes', 'still', 'room', 'new', 'TV', 'shows', 'get', 'hooked', 'Combining', 'genetically', 'provided', 'superpowers', 'X-Men', 'multi-season', 'story', 'arc', 'ideas', 'Lost', 'terrifically', 'written', 'entertainment', 'reality', 'grounded', 'segment', 'audience', 'fantasy', 'never', 'played', 'up', 'too', 'strongly', 'characters', 'are', 'written', 'more', 'detail', 'might', 'expect', 'thanks', 'part', 'largely', 'unknown', 'cast', 'never', 'have', 'doubting', 'graphic', 'novel', 'inclined', 'are', 'numerous', 'nods', 'Graphic', 'novel', 'conventions', 'bright', 'primary', 'colors', 'enjoy.As', 'overall', 'story', 'arc', 'likes', 'Lost', 'revealing', 'story', 'little', 'faster', 'having', 'satisfactory', 'conclusion', 'very', 'end', 'massive', 'hook', 'keep', 'watching', 'next', 'series', 'story', 'little', 'half', 'way', 'mark', 'up', 'again', 'finish', 'enough', 'high', 'keep', 'watching.While', 'idea', 'might', 'seem', 'have', 'kid', '-friendly', 'be', 'warned', 'violence', 'quite', 'extreme', 'due', 'superpowers', 'have', 'characters', 'do', 'things', 'certainly', 'would', 'not', 'want', 'kids', 'emulating', 'sense', 'target', 'audience', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'storylines', 'are', 'somewhat', 'light', 'compared', 'slew', 'quality', 'TV', 'programs', 'coming', 'US', 'recently', 'what', 'characters', 'particular', 'demise', 'edging', 'realm', 'horror', 'Having', 'said', 'one', 'attractions', 'series', 'have', 'cross', 'generational', 'appeal', 'just', 'bear', 'mind', 'PG-13', 'certificate', 'warranted.Great', 'cast', 'watchable', 'story', 'fast', 'paced', 'enough', 'interest', 'not', 'flag', '8/10']",Heroes: Season 1

1075161,AK1298ALMMYK0,B000QDLSR0,Mushroom Samba~,"[1, 2]","I'd like to say first that this is without a doubt the best presentation of Heroes season 1 available.  The video quality of these discs is far superior to the NBC broadcasts, but still leaves something to be desired.The disc come packaged in a handsome box set, smartly packaged on their boards instead of being stacked.  The visual quality of each episode seems to vary greatly.  As is often the case with material shot on high def, lighter scenes tend to look great, while very dark scenes are plagued by grain and other video noise.  Make no mistake, these episodes all look great.  Colors are vivid, contrast is sharp, and there are few instances of compression artifacting (commonplace when dealing with highly compressed digital video).This set also boasts some nice special features.  The commentary tracks often include several cast members along with the standard writer director combination.  This seems to keep the commentaries from ever growing stale or too technical, as the cast brings more a lay persons reading to the tracks.  The other bonuses, e.g. which superhero are you, are okay, but nothing special.  When HDDVD was still a valid format, one of the few advantages it had over BLU-ray was it's support of web-enabled content as well as support for multiple video streams.  Take a look at the fast and the furious HDDVD special features; you can customize a car with your remote, apply the changes to a specific scene, and watch your car cruise around seamlessly integrated into the movie.  That was amazing.  On these discs the potential of the HDDVD's bonus content capabilities are largely overlooked.  Specifically the online content is really nothing more than a slow webpage.For me these discs weren't great, merely ""good enough"".  These are clearly a step up in terms of visual quality from the HD broadcasts, but they don't really wow me the way other HDDVD releases did.  To reiterate good, but not great.  Worth buying if you are a heroes fan and don't want to wait for the blu-ray releases.",3,"good video quality, but not great",1206489600,"03 26, 2008",2008,2023,"[""'d"", 'like', 'say', 'first', 'doubt', 'best', 'presentation', 'Heroes', 'season', '1', 'available', 'video', 'quality', 'discs', 'far', 'superior', 'NBC', 'broadcasts', 'still', 'something', 'be', 'desired.The', 'disc', 'come', 'packaged', 'handsome', 'box', 'set', 'smartly', 'packaged', 'boards', 'instead', 'being', 'stacked', 'visual', 'quality', 'episode', 'vary', 'greatly', 'often', 'case', 'material', 'shot', 'high', 'def', 'lighter', 'scenes', 'tend', 'look', 'great', 'very', 'dark', 'scenes', 'are', 'plagued', 'grain', 'other', 'video', 'noise', 'Make', 'mistake', 'episodes', 'look', 'great', 'Colors', 'are', 'vivid', 'contrast', 'sharp', 'are', 'few', 'instances', 'compression', 'artifacting', 'commonplace', 'when', 'dealing', 'highly', 'compressed', 'digital', 'video', '.This', 'set', 'also', 'nice', 'special', 'features', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'often', 'include', 'several', 'cast', 'members', 'standard', 'writer', 'director', 'combination', 'keep', 'commentaries', 'ever', 'growing', 'stale', 'too', 'technical', 'cast', 'more', 'lay', 'persons', 'reading', 'tracks', 'other', 'bonuses', 'e.g', 'superhero', 'are', 'are', 'okay', 'nothing', 'special', 'When', 'HDDVD', 'was', 'still', 'valid', 'format', 'one', 'few', 'advantages', 'had', 'BLU-ray', 'was', 'support', 'web-enabled', 'content', 'as', 'well', 'support', 'multiple', 'video', 'streams', 'Take', 'look', 'fast', 'furious', 'HDDVD', 'special', 'features', 'can', 'customize', 'car', 'remote', 'apply', 'changes', 'specific', 'scene', 'watch', 'car', 'cruise', 'around', 'seamlessly', 'integrated', 'movie', 'was', 'amazing', 'potential', 'HDDVD', 'bonus', 'content', 'capabilities', 'are', 'largely', 'overlooked', 'Specifically', 'online', 'content', 'really', 'nothing', 'more', 'slow', 'webpage.For', 'discs', 'were', ""n't"", 'great', 'merely', 'good', 'enough', 'are', 'clearly', 'step', 'up', 'terms', 'visual', 'quality', 'HD', 'broadcasts', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'wow', 'way', 'other', 'HDDVD', 'releases', 'did', 'reiterate', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'Worth', 'buying', 'are', 'heroes', 'fan', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'wait', 'blu-ray', 'releases']",Heroes: Season 1

A week later, we sat down for the first episode, and, needless to say, our whole family was hooked.  Incredible story-line, incredible premise... it just looked like a good show.  And we watched the rest of the season just as readily, and were rarely disappointed.  There were only two things, in fact, that really disappointed us:1.  WAY too many commercials, especially at the beginning.  At first, it seemed like they had a half-hour show, couldn't think of anymore, and used commercials to drag it out to an hour.  That got a lot better throughout the season, but it happened again in the last episode, ""How to Stop and Exploding Man"" (GO NATHAN! But we'll miss you.), and got really bad.  Just need to write more show and air less commercials, IMO.2. The previews for upcoming shows got really annoying with the ""this next show is absolutely the biggest, because it has everything you've been waiting for, and to miss it would be the biggest mistake of your life"" hook (okay, they didn't use those words, but that is essentially what they said).  Every show was previewed as the most important show IN THE WORLD.  Granted, I know they wanted to build anticipation, but they overdid it just a tad.So, in other words, there was nothing really disappointing about the series itself so far, and I can't wait for Volume 2 (which started in ""How to Stop an Exploding Man."")

While shows like 24 and Lost had disapointing seasons, Heroes just shined from start to finish. This wasnt just my favorit show of this seson but it was honestly one of the best first seasons to a TV show I have ever seen right along side Lost season 1. I wouldnt hesitate for a second on picking this up. The fact that it is coming to HD DVD is just a huge huge bonus as this is without a single doubt the type of TV show made for HD. Everything from the subject matter to the look of the show fit HD like a glove. The fact that it has bonus features like the entire unaired 73 minute pilot episode is just another reason that this set will be a must buy for people. Honestly having the unaired pilot to a show that ultimatly ended up becoming this successful and this popular really makes this one of the best extras every included in a televison show both for HD and SD.As for the people saying they are going to wait for the better BD release I can only laugh at such optimism. First off BD is not better than HD DVD and I know first hand as I have both formats and second Universal is exclusive to HD DVD and there is literally zero evidence that they will ever release on BD. act is they have a contract with HD DVD that runs until the end ofthis year and I fully expect them to renew that contract as they would be really stupid not too. So keep on hoping and waiting for your season 1 of Heroes on BD and in the mean time us HD DVD owners will be content to actually watch our copies. Its time to just start facing the facts and the facts are this war is practically in a dead heat and both of these formats are going to be around for years to come. Universal is on HD DVD's side and if you really think Toshiba and Microsoft arent willing to pay them every single penny that they require to keep things that way then your living in la la land. Same can be said for BD and Disney. It wont be until these formats are so popular that these studios literally start losing hundreds of millions of dollars by not supporting the other side that they will even begin to look at that option.If your a Universal nut like me and if yur a Heroes nut like me, do yourself a favor and pick up the far less expenisive HD DVD and start enjoying it now instead of hoping that in a year or two that there might be a chance for this set coming out on BD.

1075170,AD0J5KK4WQXNS,B000QDLSR0,OverTheMoon,"[0, 0]","There has been a fair bit of hype surrounding this series, and most of it is deserved, so if you have checked out some of the best television has to offer (and the 21st century has some of the finest ever) then you may like to give Heroes a flight on your screen. I am in for season 2 and maybe you will be also.The show deals with about a dozen characters, each who discovers they have a special ability, their lives cross each other's and in the backdrop a looming crisis threatens each of them, New York and maybe the entire world. They must learn to come to terms with their abilities before it is too late.The season starts by explaining the characters and further episodes gradually bring the characters together. This is a bit of a slow burner but stick with it because the second half of this season is a way better than the first which does have some shaky moments and a few off episodes that can make you doubt it. For every low point there genuinely are some very interesting and surprising ones.  However one of its major weaknesses is that it cannot escape being labelled an X-Men clone and for all intents and purposes that is exactly what it is. It's the exact same premise dilemma of humans possibly turning against the new mutant emergences, however instead of focusing on this the series is mainly about Sylar, a mutant who becomes an increasingly dangerous force and tries to kill the other mutants. In this respect it hasn't fallen victim to being a complete X-Men rip-off but it does come too close for comfort sometimes.The other problem is that for every interesting character (with the emergence of a new actor in the making) there is one that is boring or whose potential is kept to such a minimal as to barely make them appealing enough to watch when they show up. While this could just be the producers playing some things out for future seasons it is still more than a little tedious and in particular doesn't suit its style like it would in Lost. This is Heroes. We want heroes. If we want Lost we will watch Lost. One other negative is that the story often doesn't make sense and some characters do some very silly things but this is all about the suspension of disbelief, they just ask us to buy into some things that make everyone concerned look very dim. There is a bit of an anti-climax too given such a build up.So apart from its failing why recommend it? Well it should be highly suggested for your TV series collection because its production values are consistent with the best of TV along with some nifty plots and some truly exciting story arcs.

After your first love, and for me it was the X-Men in this genre, most other things look formulaic.It took me two full episodes to warm to this series.  At first, I thought it was entirely derivative, exactly the same plot as the X-Men:  powerful mutants learn to use their powers, some are good and some bad, while a fearful public stands more or less in the dark as to the truth.  The association of Stan Lee to the production didn't help.Then I noticed several things that made this better and better in terms of quality.  The characters are quite interesting, from Hiro (the naive Manga enthusiast who relishes his status as superhero) to the complicated family, the Petrellis (one a politician who is vacillating between sleaze and conscience and his younger brother, variously seen as a softie loser and the most powerful of them all).  The acting is quite believable, if at times middling.  And they grow on you as you see alternative futures and the like for them.Then there is a tongue and cheek joking at the notion behind the entire genre of mutant superheroes, which fans take way way too seriously for their own mental balance.  It is a delicate balance, because while avoiding comedy the viewer needs to suspend their disbelief and just enjoy it.  This really worked for me because it was contained in the characters, not in stupid sit-com style situations.Finally, the peeling back of layers of conspiracy and intrigue are worthy of the X-Files.

1075191,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000QDLSR0,Robert Moore,"[163, 231]","Warning!  Multiple Spoilers below!By any standard 2006-2007 was an exceptionally good season for television, with a host of very good new series being introduced.  In fact, there was something of a battle for the survival of the fittest taking place, with more new serial dramas than viewers were able to support.  Shows with considerable potential like SIX DEGREES and THE NINE simply did not have a chance to develop given the amazing range of competition.  FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, UGLY BETTY, MEN IN TREES, DEXTER, and, of course, HEROES were some of the ones that managed to survive.HEROES was one of the more hotly debated shows on the Internet this year.  Few doubted that it was good; the question was how good.  Was it a masterpiece, potentially one of the great series ever, or was somewhat overrated, given more credit for excellence than it deserved?  Much of the debate centered on HEROES versus LOST.  I'm not quite sure why these two particular shows were paired in the debate, as if the excellence of the one somehow hinged on the excellence, or lack thereof, of the other.  Personally, I'm no great prophet, but I'm willing to take a few stabs on the relative merits of HEROES.  I loved the show, didn't miss a single episode, and looked forward to seeing it each week.  But it never hit me as a truly great affair.  If I compare it with the best supernatural/Sci-fi shows of the past decades (the audience to which the show mainly catered), it didn't, in my estimation, come up to the complexity or sophistication of BUFFY, ANGEL, ALIAS, LOST, or BATTLESTAR GALACTICA.  For instance, I just read of a call for papers for one-day academic conference in England on BATTLESTAR.  The show is so rich and complex that I can imagine dozens and dozens of potential topics for academics to discuss.  But I can't imagine this with HEROES.  It simply lacks the kind of depth you find in the other shows (though I suspect LOST's depth will be end-of-series depth, if it turns out to possess it--most of LOST's academic interest lies in its narrative techniques).  HEROES is enormous fun, but I get the sense that each week any viewer is able to absorb and process all of the information that he or she is given.  One may be left with a few questions, but they are not terribly difficult questions.  And I never found myself engaged in the kinds of online debates that I have had with BUFFY or BATTLESTAR.  Part of the reason is certainly due to the fact that HEROES is focused more on plot than on character.  BATTLESTAR, for instance, is always primarily about things that are taking place beneath the surface of the show.  With HEROES, it is mainly about what is on the surface.  In short, HEROES simply lacks a lot of the depth of the best genre shows.I read one really good description of HEROES:  BUFFY seemed to be a show produced by a great TV writer who loved comic books, while HEROES seems to be a show produced by a great comic book writer who loved TV.  I think there is some merit to that.  (For the record, I'm primarily a lover of great TV who also enjoys comics and graphic novels, and I have a couple of large bookshelves dedicated to holding various graphic novels.)The more curious debate that I've seen on the Internet was the First Half of the Season versus the Second Half of the Season.  This mystifies me because to me it seems clear that the second half of the season was far superior to the first half.  This is an important question because the vast majority of really good shows--and I very much want to believe that HEROES has the potential to be a very good show--tend to get better as they go along.  The best new show of the 2006-2007 season was unquestionably FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS (and I'm sure the few hundred people who saw it will agree with me--how can a show be so good and get so few viewers?).  And there is absolutely no question that it got better and better and better as it went along.  For me I saw HEROES as being good and fun for about the first two-thirds of the season and then near great for the final third (I'll leave aside the somewhat disappointing finale for a second).  I know the particular episode where everything kicked into a higher gear:  ""Company Man,"" in which we learn in considerable detail the nature of Mr. Bennet's job and how he became Claire's adoptive father.  For me, a series is as interesting as the characters on the show are complex and this was the first episode where any of the characters became complex as opposed to perplexing.  The rest of the season increased the complexity and the depth of the characters.  Earlier it wasn't clear that the writers grasped a simple truth:  a show about someone who can fly or become invisible or who is indestructible is not interesting; what is interesting is how a person responds to that.  But the latter part of the season did seem to ""get"" that.One reason I think that Season Two has a chance to be a lot more interesting than Season One is that in Season One you sometimes had a large ensemble cast that sometimes did little or not interaction.  Many of the main characters did not meet until the season finale (I actually would have loved to see how Peter, whose ability is to absorb the abilities of other ""heroes,"" would have reacted to being around Ali Larter's character, whose ability is a super empowered alter ego).  The various characters were simply spread about with little or no connections to one another.  But Season Two could see a much more coordinated cast.Since my review is either the first or second review written after the season finale (I refuse to write a review of any series that I have not seen completely and I really wish Amazon would make it impossible to review any season of a show before the finale has been broadcast), I thought I would say something about that.  After a season-long build up to the finale, in which there would simultaneously be a confrontation with Sylar and an attempt to prevent the nuclear destruction of New York City, the final battle was a bit of a let down.  Not only was the final resolution a bit unimaginative, there was little originality or complexity.  There was very little to mark it off as special.  Moreover, it is not even clear that in the final ""battle"" anyone even died.  All that happens is Peter and Sylar meet, Hiro delivers an apparently fatal blow to Sylar, Peter goes nuclear, Claire is about to shoot him, and Nathan intervenes by snatching him and flying off into the stratosphere before he explodes.  But irritatingly, Sylar turns out not to have died but crawled off into the sewer, and I'm betting that Nathan flew off before Peter exploded.  And Peter, of course, will rejuvenate after exploding.  One of the lessons that BUFFY taught us was that good series have body counts.  A number of characters did die over the course of the season on HEROES, but having the possibility that no one died in the finale lessened the cost of the ""victory.""  I did like the brief beginning of ""Chapter Two"" following the resolution of the nuclear incident.  Hiro finds himself catapulted somehow to 17th century Japan confronted by a larger group of archers.  A single horseman is on a distant hill, with a banner containing the symbol that is placed on the shoulder of several of the ""heroes"" in Season One, a horseman who seemed to bear a sharp resemblance to Hiro's father (played by George Takei).  So while the finale was a bit of a disappointment, this definitely pointed towards interesting things ahead.  So also did the revelation by Molly, the little girl with the ability to locate anyone by merely thinking about them, that there was someone who was far worse than Sylar.  I'm sure we'll be meeting this person in Season One.I liked the cast as a whole.  I was even bothered less by Milo Ventimiglia, who I had always intensely disliked in his days on THE GILMORE GIRLS.  Hayden Panettiere was adorable as the indestructible cheerleader (though there was a brief controversy early in the season when her gay best friend was suddenly de-gayed inexplicably, almost certainly as the result of network pressure in response to small but passionate anti-gay groups) and it was great to see a high school-aged character being played by someone actually that age.  Masi Oka quickly became a fan favorite as Hiro, the young Japanese would-be hero who somehow aspired to being able to overcome the space-time continuum, and surprisingly managed to do precisely that.  Ali Larter was wonderful as Niki/Jessica, the schizoid and incredibly dangerous beauty who struggled all season with reconciling her two natures.  Sendhil Ramamurthy was a fascinating presence as Mohinder, an Indian geneticist struggling to understand the genetic permutations that allowed some individuals to develop unusual abilities.  There were many others as well, in addition to many excellent guest appearances (though a shout out to Christopher Eccleston, the former DR. WHO star who teaches Peter how to control his powers).  My favorite character was, however, Jack Coleman as Mr. Bennet, who is easily the most complex character on the show.  Early on we suspect that he might be an utterly sinister individual; only gradually do we discover his actual agenda and aims.All in all, this was an amazingly entertaining show.  I find that different shows I watch meet different needs.  I watch BATTLESTAR GALACTICA for its depth and stunning originality and I love to debate the tiniest detail with other fans.  FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS I watch for the way it plunges so deeply into the emotional lives of its characters (it really isn't' about football).  LOST I watch for the ongoing complexity of its rich and wonderful story (after recovering from a string of weak early Season Three episodes).  But other shows I just turn off my brain and have fun.  UGLY BETTY was one of these and HEROES another.  I found it to be infectious and uncomplex fun.

I hate being told what to do!This blu-ray vs. HD DVD ""war"" crap is just too stupid. People write Amazon.com reviews for HD content like they have a personal/financial stake in either format. I can't figure out what the damn problem is.I own a PS3 and an X-BOX 360 with the HD player attachment. I own a 42"" AKAI HD projection television that I LOVE! I own blu-ray movies and I own HD DVD movies. Folks... I can't tell one goddamn difference between the two formats. I mean... what the hell is the problem, people? My god, some of you out there are giving HEROES HD a 1 star rating because its on the HD DVD format. Come on people, don't be stupid. You all are getting caught up in a manipulation by BLOCKBUSTER and TARGET -- both huge companies report that they are only going to carry blu-ray. Other companies are continuing on with the HD DVD format. Sony owns blu-ray so of course they are pushing their product. Another huge movie studio just proclaimed that they will only use HD DVD.The point of all this confusion is -- stop being children. I defy any one of you critical people out there to prove to me just how blu-ray is better than HD DVD. So far, I havent seen either format really take advantage of all that extra space that some of you proclaim that blu-ray has more of than HD DVD. So damn what! From what I can see, it looks like the regular DVD versions of HEROES may actually have more content jammed into its guts than the HD versions.Wake up, find your true compass, open your eyes and see the black for the white, and stop being stupid! If you love HEROES like I do you'll buy it in whatever format you can gets your paws on!Also, reviewers -- if you can not write a sentence using the King's English, with just a little proper grammer and syntax, then please do not try. Some of these reviews are just a crying shame.

Heroes acheives a rare success with even the villian of the series, he is clearly the bad guy but in a compelling manner, one is interested in seeing what Sylar plans next and how he thinks.  From the way Heroes get their origins in this series, one can clearly see the influence of Marvel Comics and the Mutant theme, for that's basically what the ""exceptional among  us"" are, but its done in a fashion to where it absorbs you into its premise, even guiding you to anticipate who has the genetic enhancement and who doesn't, making for some great surprises (and pleasure in correctly guessing connections).The way the stories unfold and the quality acting that propels the series truly do make for a runaway hit, it may seem slow at first, but hang with it, you won't regret it if you're even a slight fan of the genre.",5,Incredible sleeper,1190937600,"09 28, 2007",2007,1118,"['Initially', 'dismissed', 'series', 'friend', 'mine', 'convinced', 'que', 'Netflix', 'watching', 'first', 'disk', 'knew', 'had', 'have', 'entire', 'series', 'written', 'intertwined', 'drama', 'comic', 'book', 'may', 'make', 'seem', 'predictible', 'far', 'Heroes', 'rare', 'success', 'even', 'villian', 'series', 'clearly', 'bad', 'guy', 'compelling', 'manner', 'one', 'interested', 'seeing', 'what', 'Sylar', 'plans', 'next', 'how', 'way', 'Heroes', 'get', 'origins', 'series', 'one', 'can', 'clearly', 'see', 'influence', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'Mutant', 'theme', 'basically', 'what', 'exceptional', 'are', 'done', 'fashion', 'where', 'premise', 'even', 'guiding', 'anticipate', 'who', 'genetic', 'enhancement', 'who', ""n't"", 'making', 'great', 'surprises', 'pleasure', 'correctly', 'guessing', 'connections', '.The', 'way', 'stories', 'unfold', 'quality', 'acting', 'series', 'truly', 'do', 'make', 'runaway', 'hit', 'may', 'seem', 'slow', 'first', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret', ""'re"", 'even', 'slight', 'fan', 'genre']",Heroes: Season 1

1075200,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B000QDLSR0,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[4, 7]","You know what it's about: a growing circle of everyday people begin to realize that they are not everyday people at all - that they have somehow acquired an array of super powers.  In Texas, a young cheerleader learns that she cannot die.  The brother of an ambitious politician has dreams of flight.  A beautiful woman learns that she has another identity, possessing super power and compelled by a murderous impulse.  In Japan, a young man learns that he has acquired the gift to bend time and space.  An artist in Manhattan is tortured by apocalyptic visions of the future.These are just some of the inter-connecting stories that you'll see in Heroes.  Without writing too much (and turning this into the sort of review that belongs on a sci-fi blog), I'll just say that this is the perfect show.Even if sci-fi is not your thing, ""Heroes"" excels in the ease with which it draws its individual characters, has them criss-cross its adventure-filled landscape, occasionally linking up in on-going story arcs but getting enough mileage dealing with their own personal problems in the finest tradition of TV character drama.  Along with shows like ""Lost"" and the new ""Galactica"", ""Heroes"" is great fodder for non-Scifi viewers who want everyday characters confronted with non-everyday circumstances.  Scripts keep the story going, playing with our sympathies as we begin to wonder which of these characters will really be heroic.  The strengths of the characters lie in what their powers can't do (a failed cop finds that his telepathy gets him into trouble; spontaneous regeneration may complicate a cheerleader's plans for homecoming).The season is book-ended with visions of fiery catastrophe guaranteed to get anybody's attention.  If the climax does disappoint, the trip is more than enough to satisfy.  My personal peeve is the reliance on celebrity guest stars, though the leads are refreshingly unrecognizable.  With Eric Roberts as the sinister head...of some shadowy organization, Chris Eccleston doing a great spin on his former Doctor Who persona as an invisible man and nearly ageless George Takei as a Japanese tycoon.For fantasy fans, ""Heroes"" is a rare treat, easily tapping that vein that draws both kids and adult fans to superhero comics.If you haven't seen it, there's still plenty of time to get up to super-speed.",4,fun for sci-fi fans and non-fans alike,1187654400,"08 21, 2007",2007,2333,"['know', 'what', 'growing', 'circle', 'everyday', 'people', 'begin', 'realize', 'are', 'not', 'everyday', 'people', 'have', 'somehow', 'acquired', 'array', 'super', 'powers', 'Texas', 'young', 'cheerleader', 'can', 'not', 'die', 'brother', 'ambitious', 'politician', 'dreams', 'flight', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'identity', 'possessing', 'super', 'power', 'compelled', 'murderous', 'impulse', 'Japan', 'young', 'man', 'acquired', 'gift', 'bend', 'time', 'space', 'artist', 'Manhattan', 'tortured', 'apocalyptic', 'visions', 'future.These', 'are', 'just', 'inter-connecting', 'stories', ""'ll"", 'see', 'Heroes', 'writing', 'too', 'much', 'turning', 'sort', 'review', 'sci-fi', 'blog', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'perfect', 'show.Even', 'sci-fi', 'not', 'thing', 'Heroes', 'excels', 'ease', 'individual', 'characters', 'criss-cross', 'adventure-filled', 'landscape', 'occasionally', 'linking', 'up', 'on-going', 'story', 'arcs', 'getting', 'enough', 'mileage', 'dealing', 'own', 'personal', 'problems', 'finest', 'tradition', 'TV', 'character', 'drama', 'shows', 'Lost', 'new', 'Galactica', 'Heroes', 'great', 'fodder', 'non-Scifi', 'viewers', 'who', 'want', 'everyday', 'characters', 'confronted', 'non-everyday', 'circumstances', 'Scripts', 'keep', 'story', 'going', 'playing', 'sympathies', 'begin', 'wonder', 'characters', 'will', 'really', 'be', 'heroic', 'strengths', 'characters', 'lie', 'what', 'powers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'failed', 'cop', 'telepathy', 'trouble', 'spontaneous', 'regeneration', 'may', 'complicate', 'cheerleader', 'plans', 'homecoming', '.The', 'season', 'book-ended', 'visions', 'fiery', 'catastrophe', 'guaranteed', 'get', 'anybody', 'attention', 'climax', 'disappoint', 'trip', 'more', 'enough', 'satisfy', 'My', 'personal', 'peeve', 'reliance', 'celebrity', 'guest', 'stars', 'leads', 'are', 'refreshingly', 'unrecognizable', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'sinister', 'head', 'shadowy', 'organization', 'Chris', 'Eccleston', 'doing', 'great', 'spin', 'former', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'persona', 'invisible', 'man', 'nearly', 'ageless', 'George', 'Takei', 'Japanese', 'tycoon.For', 'fantasy', 'fans', 'Heroes', 'rare', 'treat', 'easily', 'tapping', 'vein', 'kids', 'adult', 'fans', 'superhero', 'comics.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'still', 'plenty', 'time', 'get', 'up', 'super-speed']",Heroes: Season 1

However, there are many INTERESTING aspects as well so I can highly recommend this series.  Characters and the main season overal story are developed over roughly 24 episodes on 7 DVDs.  If you are looking for a type of Sci-Fi series that is on Earth and is made up of slowly discovering the special abilities of people living somewhat normal lives, then THIS is it!  It is never clear who are the ""good guys"" and who are the ""bad guys"" which makes it even more exciting.  Here are some details on the disks:1.  Cases: could be better as they use the hard polycarbonate (?) style where each two disks overlap -- why? the disks are not so easy to remove.  Users want slim-pack, polypropylene cases so that the disks are easy to remove.2.  Disks: single-sided as they should be and they appear to be of good quality with no pixelation and so on.3.  Menus: each disk has a menu but they are not so easy to access later episodes.  The TOP menu should contain a listing of all episodes.4.  Price: I picked mine up from amazon when they were about $23, so wait a while for the sale if you can.  However, even at the usual discounted price of $38, the series are worth picking up.

Or maybe, like myself, you are a little of both?Evolution versus creationism is a hotly debated issue nowadays, and it has reached the floors of the US congress. Should schools teach evolution, or should they rather teach creationism?Are we really the descendants of apes? If so, are human beings still evolving? The evolution from ape to man was a big leap. Will such a big leap happen again? And if so, will we have powers that will make humans of the 21st century appear like apes to humans in future centuries? Will we be able to have powers like those portrayed in the TV series `Heroes'?I really love this series, and it might not be as farfetched as you think. I really think we are still evolving, becoming better and better at almost everything, and harnessing new powers that we take for granted today. For example, why didn't we invent electricity a few thousand years ago? Were we incapable of this feat because our brains were not yet evolved for such a feat? Why did we technologically progress more in the last 200 years than we did since man first walked on Earth? Is it because we have been biologically evolving? If so, what will we become in thousands of years from now? Will we even notice the change, or will it come around so gradual, spanning thousands of years, that we will hardly notice any change at all?From ape to human being; from human being to...?I do believe we have so much power within ourselves, but we still are not trusted with the keys to opening this power. Evolution will gradually give us the keys, but one step at a time.This series is about people discovering powers within themselves that make them super humans.  Some can fly; stop time; travel through time; read thoughts; heal quickly; become invisible; walk through walls etc... Their lives eventually become intertwined together in a fascinating storyline.

For those ""geeks"" out there, the allusions are well timed, amusing, and just obscure enough that most viewers won't get it.  The casting is brilliant and, again, a few nods of inside jokes there as well.  Yes, there is a derivative quality to some of it a la X-Men and Highlander but who cares when it is so very well done?  Usually I can anticipate plot turns and developments.  This show left me very pleasantly surprised and wrapped up so many plot threads that I was sure the final dvd would leave them all dangling.

With all the hype going on during the season, I decided to stay away from the season and watch it away from the fanboys.  Quietly, in the house, I could take my own notes, make my own observations, and draw my own conclusions.It takes a unique mind to be able to tell eight separate stories and draw all those stories into one large story.  This is what Tim Kring's goal seems to be in Season One.  The odd and unique thing is that Kring really doesn't seem to put this whole fable together in an awkward and disjointed manner; as a result Kring accomplishes the goal in a spectacular and wonderful manner.  It has been said many times over that good science fiction comes more from the characters than the premise.  Such is the case here.  This is a story that has an amazing ensemble of actors working with brilliantly fleshed-out characters.As a result of this, to me no one character of the heroes sticks out over the other--as many people love Masi Oka's wonderfully sweet Hiro, others love Hayden Panetierre's coming of age with Claire; or Greg Grunberg's Matt Parkman, and Matt getting used to hearing the thoughts of other people.  Other's love Adrian Pasdar, who channels a little bit of his old Jim Profitt character into Nathan; while others love Milo Ventimiglia's Peter because of his uncertainty as his powers develop but his belief in doing what's right.The one performance that knocked me off my feet in this season...of all people...was Ali Larter, and her split personas of Niki and the super-strong Jessica.  Just when Larter seemed destined to be remembered for the Final Destination movies and her whipped-cream bikini in Varsity Blues, she effects a dual role that left me wondering at times if, in fact, Jessica was the real person instead of Niki.  Plus, her work with Noah Gray-Cabey and D.L. Roberts stood out to me.But again, all the performances in this freshman season.  Santiago Cabrera's tortured Issac Mendez.  George Takei as Hiro's father.  The absolutely brilliant James Kyson Lee, whose Ando was Sancho Panza to Hiro's Man of La Mancha.  Zachary Quinto, who gave depth and danger to Sylar.  Gray-Cabey and Roberts.  Tawny Cypress.  Sendhil Ramamurthty, who ties all the protagonists together as Mohinder Suresh.  Jack Coleman, who had to effect two separate personalities (Noah Bennett and HRG) much in the same way that Larter did.Again, I pay all credit to Tim Kring.  He had characters starting off in all separate places, introduced them and their skills, and slowly brought them together for a wonderful climax at the end of the season.  Also, I would be remiss in not mentioning Tim Sale's wonderful artwork.  His paintings, which were used as Issac Mendez' future-predicting visions, were incredible.  Plus the music score for the series--wonderfully done by Wendy Melvoin and Lisa Coleman, or as they said in the special feature about the music for the series, ""THAT Wendy and Lisa...""; the former members of Prince and The Revolution back in the day.I really wanted to be cynical about all the hype about ""Heroes"".  Simply put, I really didn't believe it could be as good as everyone thought.  But more times than not through Season One, it was better than good--it could be great, brilliant, heart-wrenching (If not heart-breaking)...In short--and if you read the title of this review, you knew this was coming--Heroes: Season One was all that...",5,"Heroes, Season 1--...And The Bag Of Chips...",1208476800,"04 18, 2008",2008,3497,"['did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'first', 'season', 'Heroes', 'regular', 'broadcast', 'season', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'hype', 'going', 'season', 'decided', 'stay', 'away', 'season', 'watch', 'away', 'fanboys', 'Quietly', 'house', 'could', 'take', 'own', 'notes', 'make', 'own', 'observations', 'draw', 'own', 'conclusions.It', 'unique', 'mind', 'be', 'able', 'tell', 'eight', 'separate', 'stories', 'draw', 'stories', 'one', 'large', 'story', 'what', 'Tim', 'Kring', 'goal', 'be', 'Season', 'One', 'odd', 'unique', 'thing', 'Kring', 'really', ""n't"", 'seem', 'put', 'whole', 'fable', 'together', 'awkward', 'disjointed', 'manner', 'result', 'Kring', 'goal', 'spectacular', 'wonderful', 'manner', 'been', 'said', 'many', 'times', 'good', 'science', 'fiction', 'more', 'characters', 'premise', 'Such', 'case', 'here', 'story', 'amazing', 'ensemble', 'actors', 'working', 'brilliantly', 'fleshed-out', 'characters.As', 'result', 'one', 'character', 'heroes', 'sticks', 'out', 'other', 'many', 'people', 'love', 'Masi', 'Oka', 'wonderfully', 'sweet', 'Hiro', 'others', 'love', 'Hayden', 'Panetierre', 'coming', 'age', 'Claire', 'Greg', 'Grunberg', 'Matt', 'Parkman', 'Matt', 'getting', 'used', 'hearing', 'thoughts', 'other', 'people', 'Other', 'love', 'Adrian', 'Pasdar', 'who', 'little', 'bit', 'old', 'Jim', 'Profitt', 'character', 'Nathan', 'others', 'love', 'Milo', 'Ventimiglia', 'Peter', 'uncertainty', 'powers', 'develop', 'belief', 'doing', 'what', 'right.The', 'one', 'performance', 'knocked', 'off', 'feet', 'season', 'people', 'was', 'Ali', 'Larter', 'split', 'personas', 'Niki', 'super-strong', 'Jessica', 'Just', 'when', 'Larter', 'seemed', 'destined', 'be', 'remembered', 'Final', 'Destination', 'movies', 'whipped-cream', 'bikini', 'Varsity', 'Blues', 'effects', 'dual', 'role', 'left', 'wondering', 'times', 'fact', 'Jessica', 'was', 'real', 'person', 'instead', 'Niki', 'work', 'Noah', 'Gray-Cabey', 'D.L', 'Roberts', 'stood', 'out', 'me.But', 'again', 'performances', 'freshman', 'season', 'Santiago', 'Cabrera', 'tortured', 'Issac', 'Mendez', 'George', 'Takei', 'Hiro', 'father', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'James', 'Kyson', 'Lee', 'Ando', 'was', 'Sancho', 'Panza', 'Hiro', 'Man', 'La', 'Mancha', 'Zachary', 'Quinto', 'who', 'gave', 'depth', 'danger', 'Sylar', 'Gray-Cabey', 'Roberts', 'Tawny', 'Cypress', 'Sendhil', 'Ramamurthty', 'who', 'protagonists', 'together', 'Mohinder', 'Suresh', 'Jack', 'Coleman', 'who', 'had', 'effect', 'two', 'separate', 'personalities', 'Noah', 'Bennett', 'HRG', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'Larter', 'did.Again', 'pay', 'credit', 'Tim', 'Kring', 'had', 'characters', 'starting', 'off', 'separate', 'places', 'introduced', 'skills', 'slowly', 'brought', 'together', 'wonderful', 'climax', 'end', 'season', 'Also', 'would', 'be', 'remiss', 'not', 'mentioning', 'Tim', 'Sale', 'wonderful', 'artwork', 'paintings', 'were', 'used', 'Issac', 'Mendez', 'future-predicting', 'visions', 'were', 'incredible', 'music', 'score', 'series', 'wonderfully', 'done', 'Wendy', 'Melvoin', 'Lisa', 'Coleman', 'said', 'special', 'feature', 'music', 'series', 'Wendy', 'Lisa', 'former', 'members', 'Prince', 'Revolution', 'back', 'day.I', 'really', 'wanted', 'be', 'cynical', 'hype', 'Heroes', 'Simply', 'put', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'believe', 'could', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'everyone', 'thought', 'more', 'times', 'not', 'Season', 'One', 'was', 'better', 'good', 'could', 'be', 'great', 'brilliant', 'heart-wrenching', 'not', 'heart-breaking', 'short', 'read', 'title', 'review', 'knew', 'was', 'coming', 'Heroes', 'Season', 'One', 'was']",Heroes: Season 1
1075207,A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ,B000QDLSR0,Sean Pasek,"[0, 1]","When you've got Jeph Loeb (one of the comic book industry's most prolific writers) on board, it's easy to love his work.  While working for DC Comics, he did consulting work on ""Smallville,"" which is the WB/CW's most successful show.If Heroes has a problem, it might be in the set-up.  There are so many characters, that the first seven-eight episodes are mostly spent in getting you acquainted with them, their situations, their powers, and how they will utlimately come into play down the road.  Trust me.  Hang in there!  Once the plot really gets moving, you will find yourself watching one episode after the other.  I do know a few people who stopped watching the show stating, ""it never got going and I got tired of waiting.""  After I told them that things definitely got very interesting and fun, they regretted having stopped watching the show and are even now trying to catch up with this DVD set.  Also, the show might be a bit too violent for young kids.Heroes might be called a ""comic book"" style show that is grounded in realism.  It's actually very difficult to bridge the gap between the comic book world and our world, but this show does this very well.  There are no masks or spandex costumes at work.  In fact, much of the basis for these people having special abilities is grounded in genetic science.  Anyone who is a reader of the ""X-Men"" might find some interesting parallels.The cast is very good, but the strength of the show truly lies in the writing.  The small stories that eventually flow into the major plot are handled with style and grace.  If you feel that you're in the dark regarding certain plot elements, it is because you are supposed to be!  In many ways, you're not supposed to be able to predict what is coming next.Each ""hero"" has a multitude of obstacles in their path, whether it is family situations, fitting in with a crowd, trying to please a demanding father, or simply trying to do what is necessary, we find that these heroes aren't able to easily solve their problems.  In many ways, their new-found powers create more problems, and they have to learn how to use their abilities to adapt.The heroes are also gifted with one special ability, (not counting Peter Petrelli who can absorb the powers of others or Sylar who steals them) so you won't see someone flying and demonstrating super strength at the same time.Just like the X-Men, you have a government group who is trying desperately to track down these heroes and either 1) stop them from using their abilities, or 2) use them for their own purposes.  So, what happens when your father is a member of this covert agency?  This is one plot element that is addressed here.The cast is fantastic, and the special effects are great.  But what makes this show so successful is that it always focuses on the characters and not their abilities.  Most writers and directors make the mistake of focusing on the abilities, which ultimately make boring and uninteresting characters.There are some great guest stars on this show from George Takei (Star Trek's Sulu) to Malcolm McDowell (one of the screen's best villain actors).The show is great fun, and if you hang in there through the long set-up, I truly think you will enjoy this show.  Even the successful Batman and Superman films had half the movie used for origin and set-up issues.  Granted, this is a bit longer in 7-8 episodes, but it is really worth it!",5,Long Set-Up Pays off Big Dividends!,1194048000,"11 3, 2007",2007,3409,"['When', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Jeph', 'Loeb', 'one', 'comic', 'book', 'industry', 'most', 'prolific', 'writers', 'board', 'easy', 'love', 'work', 'working', 'DC', 'Comics', 'did', 'consulting', 'work', 'Smallville', 'WB/CW', 'most', 'successful', 'show.If', 'Heroes', 'problem', 'might', 'be', 'set-up', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'characters', 'first', 'seven-eight', 'episodes', 'are', 'mostly', 'spent', 'getting', 'acquainted', 'situations', 'powers', 'how', 'will', 'utlimately', 'come', 'play', 'down', 'road', 'Trust', 'Hang', 'plot', 'really', 'moving', 'will', 'find', 'watching', 'one', 'episode', 'other', 'do', 'know', 'few', 'people', 'who', 'stopped', 'watching', 'show', 'stating', 'never', 'got', 'going', 'got', 'tired', 'waiting', 'told', 'things', 'definitely', 'got', 'very', 'interesting', 'fun', 'regretted', 'having', 'stopped', 'watching', 'show', 'are', 'even', 'now', 'trying', 'catch', 'up', 'DVD', 'set', 'Also', 'show', 'might', 'be', 'bit', 'too', 'violent', 'young', 'kids.Heroes', 'might', 'be', 'called', 'comic', 'book', 'style', 'show', 'grounded', 'realism', 'actually', 'very', 'difficult', 'bridge', 'gap', 'comic', 'book', 'world', 'world', 'show', 'very', 'well', 'are', 'masks', 'spandex', 'costumes', 'work', 'fact', 'much', 'basis', 'people', 'having', 'special', 'abilities', 'grounded', 'genetic', 'science', 'Anyone', 'who', 'reader', 'X-Men', 'might', 'find', 'interesting', 'parallels.The', 'cast', 'very', 'good', 'strength', 'show', 'truly', 'writing', 'small', 'stories', 'eventually', 'flow', 'major', 'plot', 'are', 'handled', 'style', 'grace', 'feel', ""'re"", 'dark', 'regarding', 'certain', 'plot', 'elements', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'many', 'ways', ""'re"", 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'able', 'predict', 'what', 'coming', 'next.Each', 'hero', 'multitude', 'obstacles', 'path', 'family', 'situations', 'fitting', 'crowd', 'trying', 'please', 'demanding', 'father', 'simply', 'trying', 'do', 'what', 'necessary', 'find', 'heroes', 'are', ""n't"", 'able', 'easily', 'solve', 'problems', 'many', 'ways', 'new-found', 'powers', 'create', 'more', 'problems', 'have', 'learn', 'how', 'use', 'abilities', 'adapt.The', 'heroes', 'are', 'also', 'gifted', 'one', 'special', 'ability', 'not', 'counting', 'Peter', 'Petrelli', 'who', 'can', 'absorb', 'powers', 'others', 'Sylar', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'someone', 'flying', 'demonstrating', 'super', 'strength', 'same', 'time.Just', 'X-Men', 'have', 'government', 'group', 'who', 'trying', 'desperately', 'track', 'down', 'heroes', '1', 'stop', 'using', 'abilities', '2', 'use', 'own', 'purposes', 'So', 'what', 'when', 'father', 'member', 'covert', 'agency', 'one', 'plot', 'element', 'addressed', 'here.The', 'cast', 'fantastic', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'great', 'what', 'show', 'so', 'successful', 'always', 'characters', 'not', 'abilities', 'Most', 'writers', 'directors', 'make', 'mistake', 'focusing', 'abilities', 'ultimately', 'make', 'boring', 'uninteresting', 'characters.There', 'are', 'great', 'guest', 'stars', 'show', 'George', 'Takei', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Sulu', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'one', 'screen', 'best', 'villain', 'actors', '.The', 'show', 'great', 'fun', 'hang', 'long', 'set-up', 'truly', 'think', 'will', 'enjoy', 'show', 'Even', 'successful', 'Batman', 'Superman', 'films', 'had', 'movie', 'used', 'origin', 'set-up', 'issues', 'Granted', 'bit', 'longer', '7-8', 'episodes', 'really', 'worth']",Heroes: Season 1
1075208,A2RDR5G65D9H84,B000QDLSR0,Sebastian Fernandez,"[0, 0]","This is one of the most ambitious shows I have ever watched, with complex and fascinating story lines and an almost perfect execution. When I heard the name of this series, the first thing that came to mind, was the heroes of the Marvel comics. However, this show is much more along the lines of ""Smallville"", presenting people with superpowers, but who dress and act normal in most aspects of life, trying to blend in with others.The show has a considerable amount of people whose genes have evolved and therefore have special abilities. Examples includes a politician who can fly, a cheerleader who cannot get hurt, an artist who can paint the future, and a Japanese office worker who can bend time, among many others. Through the show, we get to see how the stories of these different people are interconnected. This is not all though. There are other things added to the mix: a special guy that can capture other people's abilities, a researcher who is looking for answers regarding the heroes and the death of his father, and a company that is aware of the existence of these special people and does not plan to stay aside and watch. Oh, and if that was not enough, there is the nuclear explosion that threatens to destroy the city of New York in a few weeks.Even though the first couple of episodes are a little slow and it takes a little while to grasp the idea exposed though all the different stories, by episode three I was hooked. The rest of the series went by at warp speed and I never lost interest. Besides the enthralling story lines, the suspense and the fast-paced action, one of the things I enjoyed most about the show was witnessing the process by which the heroes discover and master their special abilities, especially in the case of Peter. In the first episode, Peter thinks he can fly, like his brother Nathan, but it is only after a while that he truly understands what he can achieve.The quantum leaps in time provide another mesmerizing element to the story, end even though this presents a great challenge to the creators, they manage to avoid most of the major pitfalls. There are some minor problems with some of the logic, but these are minor mistakes, especially considering the complexity of the plot. In terms of the actors, we get good performances from most, and really excellent ones from Milo Ventimiglia (Peter Petrelli), Hayden Panettiere (Claire the cheerleader) and Masi Oka (Hiro Nakamura). In the first few episodes, the performance of Ali Larter, as Niki / Jennifer, seems stiff and exaggerated, but once she gets the hang of it, things improve dramatically.People that get upset by non-linear stories should probably stay away from this series, but if complexity does not bother you, there are not many shows as interesting as this one. If the seasons to come are as good as this first season, I will be entertained for a while.",5,"""I don't know how, I don't know when, but I have to stop it""",1193270400,"10 25, 2007",2007,2875,"['one', 'most', 'ambitious', 'shows', 'have', 'ever', 'watched', 'complex', 'fascinating', 'story', 'lines', 'almost', 'perfect', 'execution', 'When', 'heard', 'name', 'series', 'first', 'thing', 'came', 'mind', 'was', 'heroes', 'Marvel', 'comics', 'However', 'show', 'much', 'more', 'lines', 'Smallville', 'presenting', 'people', 'superpowers', 'who', 'dress', 'act', 'normal', 'most', 'aspects', 'life', 'trying', 'blend', 'others.The', 'show', 'considerable', 'amount', 'people', 'genes', 'have', 'evolved', 'therefore', 'have', 'special', 'abilities', 'Examples', 'politician', 'who', 'can', 'fly', 'cheerleader', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'hurt', 'artist', 'who', 'can', 'paint', 'future', 'Japanese', 'office', 'worker', 'who', 'can', 'bend', 'time', 'many', 'others', 'show', 'get', 'see', 'how', 'stories', 'different', 'people', 'are', 'interconnected', 'not', 'are', 'other', 'things', 'added', 'mix', 'special', 'guy', 'can', 'capture', 'other', 'people', 'abilities', 'researcher', 'who', 'looking', 'answers', 'regarding', 'heroes', 'death', 'father', 'company', 'aware', 'existence', 'special', 'people', 'not', 'plan', 'stay', 'aside', 'watch', 'Oh', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'nuclear', 'explosion', 'destroy', 'city', 'New', 'York', 'few', 'weeks.Even', 'first', 'couple', 'episodes', 'are', 'little', 'slow', 'little', 'grasp', 'idea', 'exposed', 'different', 'stories', 'episode', 'three', 'was', 'hooked', 'rest', 'series', 'went', 'warp', 'speed', 'never', 'lost', 'interest', 'enthralling', 'story', 'lines', 'suspense', 'fast-paced', 'action', 'one', 'things', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'show', 'was', 'witnessing', 'process', 'heroes', 'discover', 'master', 'special', 'abilities', 'especially', 'case', 'Peter', 'first', 'episode', 'Peter', 'can', 'fly', 'brother', 'Nathan', 'only', 'while', 'truly', 'what', 'can', 'achieve.The', 'quantum', 'leaps', 'time', 'provide', 'mesmerizing', 'element', 'story', 'end', 'even', 'great', 'challenge', 'creators', 'manage', 'avoid', 'most', 'major', 'pitfalls', 'are', 'minor', 'problems', 'logic', 'are', 'minor', 'mistakes', 'especially', 'considering', 'complexity', 'plot', 'terms', 'actors', 'get', 'good', 'performances', 'most', 'really', 'excellent', 'ones', 'Milo', 'Ventimiglia', 'Peter', 'Petrelli', 'Hayden', 'Panettiere', 'Claire', 'cheerleader', 'Masi', 'Oka', 'Hiro', 'Nakamura', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'performance', 'Ali', 'Larter', 'Niki', '/', 'Jennifer', 'stiff', 'exaggerated', 'once', 'hang', 'things', 'improve', 'dramatically.People', 'get', 'upset', 'non-linear', 'stories', 'should', 'probably', 'stay', 'away', 'series', 'complexity', 'not', 'bother', 'are', 'not', 'many', 'shows', 'as', 'interesting', 'one', 'seasons', 'come', 'are', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'season', 'will', 'be', 'entertained', 'while']",Heroes: Season 1

An action-packed, creative and intelligent show that reveals the kind of mature writing comic books often have. ""Heroes"" is about what the title implies. Across the globe people begin to discover that they posses unique abilities. Some can walk through walls, stop time, or read minds. The main plot follows the heroes as they try to stop a bomb from going off in New York City. No one knows were the bomb is or who is going to detonate it. but thanks to the time traveling Hiro, they know they only have a limited amount of time. What's nice about Heroes is that while the show moves steadily with the main plot, it balances itself by going off on numerous subplots that reveal the individual heroes stores like Clare's relationship with her mysterious hero kidnapping dad, Hiro(My favorite character) learning the code of the samurai,Peter and Nickie's family problems and the creepy hero killing Sylar.

Heroes isn't your standard comic book fan's television show. This is some serious writing with drama, depth and yeah... some fun and action as well.What makes this show so great is the large cast of characters who all seem to have significance in the story. Even better is that all of these characters come from different backgrounds and approach life in different ways, but at the same time there is something special about them. Everybody has that fantasy of being special and this show has at least one character in it you can identify with.The writing is almost pitch perfect with every episode giving you something to get excited about. The show is done in serial format so what happens in one episode resonates throughout the series, and Heroes takes it to a grand level. Sometimes you get a great cliffhanger styled ending and sometimes you just a cool revelation. Either way each ep is sure to please. That's especially for the last episode of the season, which answers a lot of questions, keeps the lesser questions still hanging, asks even more questions, and ties up the major loose ends nicely. So nicely that even if the show never made to the second season you would have a well-rounded story from beginning to end.Now for the DVD. If you are going to do it this is the way to go! This DVD is packed. Here's what you get:- An extended version of the pilot episode. 73 minutes long according to my sources. That's an extra 30 minutes AND includes footage of a never before seen character! Well... people saw it at the San Diego ComicCon last year, but that's besides the point.- 50 (that's right... 50!!!) deleted and extended scenes.- Making of Heroes featurette as well as specials on the stunts, special effects, and music score.- Special profile of Tim Sale: the artist who does Isacc Mendez' paintings.- A mind reading mini-game (don't ask me... that's what I heard).This is going to be a killer DVD set. I also heard Heroes season 1 will come out on HD DVD. The buzz is they will include special features exclusive to the HD version in addition to all of the features already on the DVD.

If you've been disillusioned by the same, boring dramas week after week on network television, this is the kind of show that will restore your faith in good television writing.I could tell you about all the characters, plot twists and hidden nods to comic books in Heroes, but that's been covered by other reviewers, much better than I could ever write.The question you're probably asking yourself is....what can this reviewer say to make ME decide to give Heroes a chance?To set the stage, let's consider some of the movies that have come out about comic book characters: Batman, Daredevil, The Punisher, just to name a few.The comic book movie that stands out, and the one which most people have seen, isSpider-Man (Widescreen Special Edition).But why?It's because Spider-Man isn't a stereotypical hero from Krypton or born into extreme wealth who immediately wants to help other people...he's Peter Parker, a teenage kid from Queens, who never wanted the limelight and wanted to be like everybody else. However, fate decided that his great power also carried with it some great responsibilities - and that means he had to give up some things he really wanted to help others.Spider-Man works because viewers can relate to a character who has human flaws and doesn't always make the right choices...the choice of selflessness, and thinking of others before oneself, is the surest sign of a hero.Now let's swing back to the tv show.In the case of Heroes, we are introduced to a special group of people across the globe that discover they are more than just ordinary....they are extraordinary. While some of them are excited about their abilities, some of them [like our friendly neighborhood Spider-Man], just want to shirk back into the doldrums and be the same as everyone else. Some of them are afraid of being different. Some of their powers honestly frighten them and they would give their left arm just to be 'normal' again. There is one person who gets intoxicated with their powers and wants nothing more than complete and total domination. It's up to our heroes, whether directly or indirectly, to stop him.It would be easy to make a show that showcases special effects and pays no attention to character development; but this box set of Heroes takes us on a 23 episode arc which explores the motivations of every character, whether good or evil.I think one of the greatest strengths of Heroes is the struggle of each 'special' person. In their own way, each character comes to their own understanding of what a hero really is....a person noted for feats of courage or nobility of purpose. Are they ready to accept their destiny? Or will they tuck tail and run the other way?This entire first season plays out like a perfectly scripted comic book. Each episode ends with a cliffhanger, and will have you itching to put the next disc into the DVD player. The special features include deleted scenes, commentary audio tracks, interviews, and more. The box set also has the unaired 73-minute pilot episode...this offers us insights into some of the existing heroes and shows us one hero that was cut and then re-created into another character.You don't have to have superpowers to be a hero.And you don't have to read comic books to love this show.These Heroes have stories to tell...don't keep them waiting.",5,Every Hero's journey has a beginning.,1203638400,"02 22, 2008",2008,3395,"['must', 'admit', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'show', 'Fall', '2007', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'did', ""'ve"", 'been', 'disillusioned', 'same', 'boring', 'dramas', 'week', 'week', 'network', 'television', 'kind', 'show', 'will', 'restore', 'faith', 'good', 'television', 'writing.I', 'could', 'tell', 'characters', 'plot', 'twists', 'hidden', 'nods', 'comic', 'books', 'Heroes', 'been', 'covered', 'other', 'reviewers', 'much', 'better', 'could', 'ever', 'write.The', 'question', ""'re"", 'probably', 'asking', '.what', 'can', 'reviewer', 'say', 'make', 'ME', 'decide', 'give', 'Heroes', 'chance', 'set', 'stage', 'let', 'consider', 'movies', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'comic', 'book', 'characters', 'Batman', 'Daredevil', 'Punisher', 'just', 'name', 'few.The', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'out', 'one', 'most', 'people', 'have', 'seen', 'isSpider-Man', 'Widescreen', 'Special', 'Edition', '.But', 'why', 'Spider-Man', ""n't"", 'stereotypical', 'hero', 'Krypton', 'born', 'extreme', 'wealth', 'who', 'immediately', 'help', 'other', 'people', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'teenage', 'kid', 'Queens', 'who', 'never', 'wanted', 'limelight', 'wanted', 'be', 'everybody', 'else', 'However', 'fate', 'decided', 'great', 'power', 'also', 'carried', 'great', 'responsibilities', 'had', 'give', 'up', 'things', 'really', 'wanted', 'help', 'others.Spider-Man', 'works', 'viewers', 'can', 'relate', 'character', 'who', 'human', 'flaws', ""n't"", 'always', 'make', 'right', 'choices', 'choice', 'selflessness', 'thinking', 'others', 'surest', 'sign', 'hero.Now', 'let', 'swing', 'back', 'tv', 'show.In', 'case', 'Heroes', 'are', 'introduced', 'special', 'group', 'people', 'globe', 'are', 'more', 'just', 'ordinary', 'are', 'extraordinary', 'are', 'excited', 'abilities', '[', 'friendly', 'neighborhood', 'Spider-Man', ']', 'just', 'want', 'shirk', 'back', 'doldrums', 'be', 'same', 'everyone', 'else', 'are', 'afraid', 'being', 'different', 'powers', 'honestly', 'frighten', 'would', 'give', 'left', 'arm', 'just', 'be', ""'normal"", 'again', 'one', 'person', 'who', 'intoxicated', 'powers', 'nothing', 'more', 'complete', 'total', 'domination', 'up', 'heroes', 'directly', 'indirectly', 'stop', 'him.It', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'make', 'show', 'special', 'effects', 'attention', 'character', 'development', 'box', 'set', 'Heroes', '23', 'episode', 'arc', 'motivations', 'character', 'good', 'evil.I', 'think', 'one', 'greatest', 'strengths', 'Heroes', 'struggle', ""'special"", 'person', 'own', 'way', 'character', 'own', 'understanding', 'what', 'hero', 'really', '.a', 'person', 'noted', 'feats', 'courage', 'nobility', 'purpose', 'Are', 'ready', 'accept', 'destiny', 'will', 'tuck', 'tail', 'run', 'other', 'way', 'entire', 'first', 'season', 'out', 'perfectly', 'scripted', 'comic', 'book', 'episode', 'cliffhanger', 'will', 'have', 'itching', 'put', 'next', 'disc', 'DVD', 'player', 'special', 'features', 'include', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'commentary', 'audio', 'tracks', 'interviews', 'more', 'box', 'set', 'also', 'unaired', '73-minute', 'pilot', 'episode', 'insights', 'existing', 'heroes', 'one', 'hero', 'was', 'cut', 'then', 're-created', 'character.You', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'have', 'superpowers', 'be', 'hero.And', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'read', 'comic', 'books', 'love', 'show.These', 'Heroes', 'have', 'stories', 'tell', 'do', ""n't"", 'keep', 'waiting']",Heroes: Season 1

I'd never seen it before but heard many good things. The whole superhero aspect really interested me. So I took a chance.It starts out slow, giving detailed background information on each character while moving the plot forward at what seems like a snails pace. But as we learn more and more about each character, how they tie together, and what will happen next (or what we THINK will happen), it becomes quite addictive! We are eager to learn the superpowers each of them get, how they use them, and what will happen next. It's a beautiful formula carefully planned out to keep people watching. I've never seen any of the other seasons, so I don't know if they've kept it up. From what I've heard so far they've slipped a bit...but who knows.What I like best about the DVD itself is the layout of the content, the comicbook style of the chapters. To me this gives the overall feel that we're actually seeing a comicbook, rather than just a show. I love how the extra/deleted scenes are on each disc, rather than colleting them together seperately at the end; this way we don't have to scratch our heads as to where such-n-such scene happened. The ""documentary"" features on the last disc are quite short, but give the viewer a basic overall aspect of how things came together. I would have liked to have seen more details on the original concepts, character creation, and stuff like that. But perhaps its best that we don't know everything; it might spoil the fun of discovering through the show what happened.Overall I can't recommend this enough. Might want to wait and get it around $20 or so, but I would pay $35 for it as well. This series would be great for kids, and I'd recommend it to people who feel that their meant for something more than just working a job they hate.

All of a sudden the return of the great sitcom and now the dramatic television programs on network tv are finally overshadowing HBO. Heroes is the return to glory for NBC because it came into the superhero hype to create an origional story about ordinary people becomeing extraordinary. Unlike the well known super-hero stories Heroes takes a very human look into people from all walks of life discovering they are gifted. The writting is fantastic because it feels like you are reading a comic book. The show is build around visuals and very easy to follow dioligue. This all comes from a guy who had never read comic books in his life and went to some of the most well known in the business to write the first chapter of what could a historical television program. I had not seen this show as it aired on TV but picking up this DVD set showed me that this show really was everything I though it was going to be and I am very much looking forward to seeing where the story will go.

1075239,A2GOT71TLMZ5I5,B000QDLSR0,Victor Capo,"[25, 46]","I have to admit, I wasn't too keen on this show when I first saw the ads for it. It looked a little bit too ""X-Men"" for me, and in the end, it is very, very similar. However, the show separates itself by focusing on the drama and humanity behind each character and not so much on their super powers (although there's a generous amount of that, too!). With the exception of 2 laughably bad episodes (episode 2 with its hokey dialogue and awkward first appearance by Greg Grunberg, and one towards the end which is slow and tedious and really just felt like filler until the season finale), it's an excellent show with high production values, great actors, and well-written characters and storylines. Even non-sci-fi types can get into the drama this show offers.On a side note, I just wanted to mention to those of you ""holding out"" for a Blu-Ray release, that probably won't be happening anytime soon, if ever. The show is owned by Universal and Universal is exclusively supporting the HD DVD format and has recently expressed plans to continue doing so.I have both a Blu-Ray player (through my PlayStation 3) and an HD DVD player (through my Xbox 360). While many of you with PS3's and standalone Blu-Ray players are understandably upset by this decision, it is inaccurate to think of Blu-Ray as the ""superior"" format just because it's selling more. When looking at the technical specs between Blu-Ray and HD DVD, HD DVDs actually use superior compression and encoding methods geared specifically for high definition content when transferring movies onto the disc, whereas Blu-Ray uses the same compression and encoding techniques used on standard definition DVDs. This means that movies released on both formats actually look better on HD DVD than their Blu-Ray counterparts. I've seen this for myself with numerous movies and the HD DVD versions consistently look (and sometimes sound) better.That having been said, I'm happy this is coming to HD DVD instead of Blu-Ray.

We follow them on their journey to find out more about themselves as well as their place in the saga.It is telling that season one ends with the brothers Petrelli sacrificing themselves rather than destroying part of NYC, which would have ushered in a police state and fascism, with Peter Petrelli as president and his devious mother working behind the scenes to create a new world order.

1075241,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B000QDLSR0,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[7, 8]","Taking his inspiration from comic books like ""The Avengers"" and ""Justice League"" as his inspiration writer/producer/creator Tim Kring (""Crossing Jordan"") imagined a world where extraordinary heroes with superhuman capabilities came from ordinary folks. Without solid writing, direction and performances this would be just another wanna-be TV drama as hollow as the 70's TV adaption of ""Spider-Man"". Instead, it's intelligently written (and some of it has been explored in comic books within the last twenty years but no one has explored it as well as Kring's show)with strong performances and direction. The show didn't become a powerhouse ratings sensation based on mindless drivel nor based on the sneak peak at Comic-Com. The show earned its kudos for dealing with a number of fascinating themes in the context of a fantasy.I'm going to focus mostly on the quality of the show in this review, the extras and the quality of the DVDs/HD-DVDs and only touch on the storyline assuming most of you know it or have read about it elsewhere. If not, I have a brief synposis of the plot (avoiding spoilers). You can skip the next paragraph if you have seen the show.Kring uses multiple characters that represent the next stage in human evolution and together have to somehow saved the world from a horrible event (which is revealed fairly early in the show). There are also two subplots involving the search for a serial killer which is somehow tied into the main plot and a mysterious government agency that is tracking these ""ordinary"" heroes for its own mysterious purposes.First compliments to Kring who learned the lesson of ""The X-Files"" and ""Lost""; know where your story is going and clue your audience in early on so they know there IS a pay off but gradually divulge the details over time. As with ""Lost"" Kring occasionally delves into the back story of these characters but primarily focuses on their journey and the conflicts/collaborations between them. The first season of ""Heroes"" was virtually flawless with impeccable writing and direction (featuring veterans such as film and TV director John Badham) that featured production values you'd see in a feature film. NBC's gamble with ""Heroes"" paid off as after Comic-Con the show generated tremendous buzz (the pilot was shown there). Critics responded and in a rare sign of unity so did TV viewers. Here's hoping that the second season doesn't suffer from the sophomore slum that plagued the second season of ""Lost"". Expectations are high but I suspect that Kring and his team will deliver.Both the standard and HD version of ""Heroes"" receive a superb transfer from Universal. The image looks sharp with bold colors and terrific of the surround sound effects as well. While I did have a problem with disc three skipping and freezing, I suspect (and hope) this isn't a symptom of Universal's ongoing manufacturing issues that began to plague the studio at the end of 2005.First up my only complaint about the show is that there is no chapter placed directly after the main titles. Also, if you watch the individual episodes you are stuck with watching the ""previously on `Heroes'"" tag at the beginning. These aren't necessary and could have been dropped from the set or, at the very least, have a chapter title place so that you could skip them without having to fast forward through the beginning of the episode.We get the original pilot which had a substantially different subplot involving a terrorist which was completely cut from the show. While it worked pretty well, dropping it was probably wise given the popularity of the theme with shows like ""24"". Writer/producer Tim Kring provides a very good commentary track discussing the changes, details of the shooting and changes the network suggested be made and why he resisted on occasion. The unaired pilot runs longer than the final version by about 20 minutes.We get 12 other commentary tracks a terrific move from Universal which hasn't always provided much in the way of extras for many of their popular series. The bulk of the commentary tracks are very good with various production members teamed with cast in discussing the making of the episode. This happy mix means that we get both technical information on the shoot as well as on-set info and the take by the actors on the development of their characters and the series.We get deleted/alternate scenes for a lot of the episodes and you can access them for each one individually. A pity that some of these deleted scenes weren't seamlessly branched as some worked adding to the show and most were cut for time constraints (although there was the occasional episode that truly had deleted scenes because they either didn't work or were superfluousWe get five featurettes, a game and sneak peaks. ""Mind Reader"" is a clever game involving Parkman's ability to reader minds and the old trick of picking a number. The game then picks the number you selected.""Making of `Heroes'"" is a brief but interesting featurette on the genesis, pitch and development of the show featuring plenty of interviews with Kring, the cast and other snippets of the production team. We also find out about where the show is headed and the response to the show at Comic-Con last year.""Special Effects"" features visual effects supervisor Mark Kolpack discussing how they are able to pull of the CGI for the show, make it look real on a TV time frame and budget.""Profile of Artist Tim Sale"" allows us to see the guy who really creates the paintings and drawings of the character Isaac Mendez. This veteran of Marvel comics brings just the right element of pop-art to Mendez paintings and the comic book he writes that ends up being pivotal early on in the show.The Score"" focuses on composers Wendy Melvoin and Lisa Coleman who were members of Prince's Revolution and have collaborated with songwriters Neil Finn (Crowded House) and others. They, in turn, discuss collaborating with Shankar who provides the ethereal vocals for the series.""The Stunts"" shows how many of the key stunts were created, how the actors participated with on-set wire work and when stunt doubles were used.Overall this is a terrific set from Universal which could be improved by creating some additional chapter stops, eliminating the preview tags for the previous episodes (something you really don't need on DVD but they should be optional in case you do want them). We do get a play all option which is nice and a series of top notch extras that add value to the set. With the show premiering its second season on September 24 of this year, ""Heroes"" arrives in the nick of time to save the viewer from being puzzled as to what the developments were during season one.

I always thought it was brilliant how the writers only let the viewer realize the villians deep into the season. I will get season 3 of heroes and maybe season 4, however the downside was the last season. I could not follow it, and that is the hallmark that the writers and producers have run out of good story lines.

A great ensemble cast, visual effects, and plot twists that will keep you guessing throughout the entire season.The DVD special features are definitely worth the price of purchase even if you've already seen all the episodes on TV. For one, the alternate, 75-minute pilot is an interesting look into what might have been. All of cast/crew commentaries are extremely entertaining, I particularly favor those with Greg Grunberg.The various behind-the-scenes pieces are also great eye-openers which illustrate just how epic of a production this TV show really is.

""Zee Cee""","[2, 4]","Most network television is awful (Fox occasionally is ""on"" but then seems to often cancel their best shows when they do get it right.)  This is why I haven't bought a TV in 30 years and only owned one during that time for a few years when someone pitied me for not having one and foisted one on me.  I've seen terrific HBO and Showtime series on DVD, but very little of network TV is even half-tolerable.So people who watch a lot of TV may not notice what's wrong with this show because they are so used to this wrongness.  It's like someone's been putting dog poo in their food for so long, they say ""yum"" when they get that taste again.  But dog poo is dog poo and not meant to be consumed.  To wit:1)  It's glacially slow.  You can summarize the whole season in 25 words.2)  It spends 25% of the time of each show recapping the previous plot points.  So it's slow in the first place, and now it's even slower.  The whole thing could have been a six-episode, commercial-free okay miniseries, like Lost Room (though not nearly that good) with a satisfying ending and been done with for good, and it could have (in that case) been pretty good adventure show.3)  The dramatic pace is sacrificed for advertisers' needs as timing commercial breaks is the number one priority.  Again, people are so used to this, they don't see what an artistic travesty this is--but it certainly is one.  For this reason, I'd much rather watch mediocre BBC than any NBC.It does a few things better than average tv.  The blanding-down of characters and situations so typical of American network TV isn't quite as bad here--you do have a sex worker (albeit with a heart of gold, yawn) and a sympathetic heroin addict. (On CBS, they would have blanded them down to a romance novelist and a drunk.)Other valid points some other negative reviewers have made, and I won't repeat, but I will say I thought the acting was fine and like most people, found Hiro the most engaging of the characters.Life is short, and spending it watching awful TV to get to something this limp so you can think it's ""good"" is just tragic.
