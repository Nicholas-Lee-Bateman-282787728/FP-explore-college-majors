944711,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B000BLBZFW,Andy Orrock,"[6, 7]","I'm a huge fan of Ronit Elkabetz, having seen her excellent work most recently inThe Band's Visit(Bikur Ha-Tizmoret).  One of my favorite movies isLate Marriage(Hatuna Meuheret).  She appears brilliantly there, too, as Lior Ashkenazi's love interest, heartbreakingly shunned by his family.  In her homeland, Ms. Elkabetz's signature role is that of downtrodden, sickly prostitute Ruthie in this look at Tel Aviv's seamy side from director Keren Yedaya.As outstanding as Elkabetz is here, this is Dana Ivgy's movie. She portrays Ruthie's daughter 'Or'.  The review on these pages that nailed it is the one comparing this movie to the Japanese releaseNobody Knows- these are two works in which the children are forced in a hurry to become adults.  And, with Ruthie as a role model, you can pretty much guess Or's career path.Ivgy - an Israeli beauty in the Aya Koren mold - also appeared indelibly inBroken Wings(Knafayim Shvurot), a movie that appears near the top of my growing list of recommendations for great Israeli cinema.  This is a country that punches way above its weight when it comes to the quality of its movies.Now, my list of ""gotta see"" Israeli films look like this (in approximate order of my relative enthusiasm):1.Walk on Water2.The Syrian Bride3.Broken Wings4.The Band's Visit5.Late Marriage6.Time of Favor7.

The relationship between mother and daughter was well developed in a way. I can see the reasoning behind both characters' actions throughout the story. But it was a little unclear of why they were in the situation they were in, and why they didn't do something to remedy it. I didn't particularly like the choices the characters made near the end of the movie, but not all stories are happy and not everyone makes the right choices. At least, the choices they made in this movie were backed by actions that had occurred. The other two movies I reviewed today there was no real reason or point to the decisions the characters make, and in this one there are. I enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to a lot of people.

Having just left the hospital, 'Ruthie' (the mother) wiggles into her hot pants and prepares to go back to turning tricks no the street.Ruthie is too old to get a 'regular' job in a proper brothel and her street customers frequently give her physical violence in lieu of a tip. These are more than enough reasons for teen daughter 'Or' to step and 'play' parent by locking her mother inside the apartment and forcing mom to start a new job as a cleaning lady.Both actresses give compelling performances but the more 'Or' does for Ruthie the more she realizes that the 'apple doesn't fall far from the tree' in terms of seeing the opportunities that prostitution can offer a young woman when the alternative is working long hours as a pot scrubber in a restaurant.This is not a formula movie like ""thirteen"" and has both humor and poignancy galore.

944715,AOS6E2MVT8ZL0,B000BLBZFW,"Judy Croome ""Judy Croome | @judy_croome""","[1, 2]","This is a movie about the sacrifices a young girl has to make in the name of love and the drama in ""Or, my Treasure"" lies in the slow build-up of watching Or, a young girl, care for her prostitute mother Ruthie. This forced reversal of roles takes its inevitable toll on Or. She scurries around doing everything she can to get her mother off the streets, while trying to live as normal a life as possible. From falling in love with the neighbours son to washing piles of filthy dishes in a small cafe, Or struggles against the tide of her mother's legacy: sexual promiscuity.As Ruthie compulsively walks a path of self destruction, Or fights against the realities of a marginalised life and holds on to her innocent hopes of saving her mother and finding a normal love. But life on the streets is as hard as it is addictive to Ruthie and Or is finally forced to make an impossible choice.Performances by both Dana Igvy as Or and Ronit Elkabetz as her streetwalker mother, Ruthie, are superb and well-supported by secondary actors.

I understand that the girl struggled with self image (a byproduct of being raised by a prostitute) yet she was far more functional, capable and mature than her mother. Her lack of self seemed out of character with what was portrayed otherwise. I accept that perhaps the point of it is to suggest that this trait trumps all others.
