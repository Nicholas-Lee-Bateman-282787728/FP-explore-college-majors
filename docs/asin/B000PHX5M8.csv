1071352,A2OKCS5234ZV7S,B000PHX5M8,Flower,"[0, 0]","Well I have to say that I am so excited to finally own my own copy of the second season. I am so excited!!! My husband and I would pay extra for show time during the seasons of soul food just to watch soul food! That is the only reason we would pay extra for cable.. I remember I could not wait to get home to watch soul food with my husband. It was the show to watch!We waited and waited to buy this series because it was sooooooooo expensive... I will say that it was worth the wait and worth the deal that we received. So I am double excited about finally owning this series. We now can watch soul food anytime and as many times as I want!Which is great since there is really nothing good on TV...... now a days.............As far as the series being edited, yes it would be nice if all of the scenes were left as they aired on showtime. I don't understand what the reason was for the editing. The rating on amazon states unrated.For us, we still wanted the series as we wanted to see for ourselves what was edited out. So far we are enjoying the series the way it is, The scenes are as we remember them, we will continue to watch to see what was and was not edited out.We will be watching this, over this holiday season and into and through out the new year.. Just in time for the holidays!We were looking for something to watch for the holidays and every year we usually add a few new DVD's to our collections. This makes a great addition!I don't want to give any spoilers away, all I can say is that we were hooked on this series the first time we watched!And now to the great part of it all. We only paid $8.00 plus tax for the first series and $9.00 plus tax for the second series! What a deal!Well, I found season three on amazon and lost it while in my cart. It is okay, because I ended up getting a better deal. So now all I need is the final season. I will make an update about the conditions of the order once, I receive the order. I am so excited about the amount I saved. It was not meant for me to have the first one that I selected as it was more expensive due to it being new. So for now I will continue to watch season one and two! I will be glad when more series or movies are made that are similar to soul food and this is a very positive series. Well back to season one!**************2012 update**********************We are still loving this series, as we own the whole set. We pulled the plug on cable due to the waste of money we were spending over a year and also because to us there was really nothing good on. So we are happy that we have the Soul food series to view! This series is so much fun, entertainment, worth viewing over and over, we never become tired of watching this series. You can not watch just one episode. You will want to go from season to season. I thought that each set was packaged well and that the quality of the DVD's is great.If you have not purchased this T.V. Series you are missing out. You will laugh, cry, jump for joy, feel happy, feel warmth and be entertained to the fullest!Every episode has something to offer and shows different aspects of life in many different ways. The scenery is very colorful and the homes and lifestyles of every character can and will teach you great lessons.I will keep my hope up for more T.V. Series like this that will come on regular T.V. There is really not that many great shows on T.V. in the current T.V. business and cable shows the same things over and over. So having this to view after a long day of work brings joy, peace, and just time well spent in front of the T.V.My husband and I love to watch this series together. And I like the fact that this series shows men in positive rolls and taking care of their family. For single women, it also shows what they go through and how tough it is for them. All walks of life can be found in this series.. Great for showing how family can be and should be.. Love the family dinners, as my family and I used to have family dinner every Sunday with our great grandmother we are in the process of reorganizing family dinners!Enjoy and Happy watching to you!",5,Yes season two!

1071353,A35JR4D6FLXYRQ,B000PHX5M8,Geminigirl,"[0, 0]","Like a lot of reviewers, I fell in love with this show during its 2nd season run on Showtime. I actually taped the series but don't really have time to compare what they've cut or edited - I have noticed that musically Kina & Ludicrous were edited out as well as the music featured in their favorite hangout has been edited out so it does look strange to see them ""jammin in the club"" to some smooth jazz styled ""muzak"".  I'm angered about the fact that fans who lobbied so hard to get this series on dvd have to pay premium prices for a sub-par product.But be that as it may, this season was truly entertaining with strong storylines for not only the Joseph Sisters but their men as well.  My favorite storylines are:* Terry's battle with panic attacks, attempts to help her family after the accident and on-the-job struggles* Terry & Damon's breakup, his struggle to get his business off the ground & his affair with Christine* Bird's ""growing pains"" after her recovery from the accident* Lem's Mama drama* Ahmad standing up for Maxine when Kenny lashes out at her one too many times* Maxine & Kenny's break-up/Maxine confronting LilaAnd the most hilarious backstory concerned Lem & Bird's use of a massage oil which causes a rash.I only wish that CBS/Paramount had added extras - interviews, back stage segments AND detailed info regarding what scenes were edited.All in all, I spent a very enjoyable weekend watching the entire series and would recommend it to fans of this groundbreaking series.",4,Soul Food - Season 2,1203206400,"02 17, 2008",2008,1500,"['lot', 'reviewers', 'fell', 'love', 'show', '2nd', 'season', 'run', 'Showtime', 'actually', 'taped', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'time', 'compare', 'what', ""'ve"", 'cut', 'edited', 'have', 'noticed', 'musically', 'Kina', 'Ludicrous', 'were', 'edited', 'out', 'as', 'well', 'music', 'featured', 'favorite', 'hangout', 'been', 'edited', 'out', 'look', 'strange', 'see', 'jammin', 'club', 'smooth', 'jazz', 'styled', 'muzak', ""'m"", 'angered', 'fact', 'fans', 'who', 'lobbied', 'so', 'hard', 'get', 'series', 'dvd', 'have', 'pay', 'premium', 'prices', 'sub-par', 'product.But', 'be', 'may', 'season', 'was', 'truly', 'entertaining', 'strong', 'storylines', 'not', 'only', 'Joseph', 'Sisters', 'men', 'well', 'favorite', 'storylines', 'are', '*', 'Terry', 'battle', 'panic', 'attacks', 'attempts', 'help', 'family', 'accident', 'on-the-job', 'struggles*', 'Terry', 'Damon', 'breakup', 'struggle', 'get', 'business', 'ground', 'affair', 'Christine*', 'Bird', 'growing', 'pains', 'recovery', 'accident*', 'Lem', 'Mama', 'drama*', 'Ahmad', 'standing', 'up', 'Maxine', 'when', 'Kenny', 'out', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'times*', 'Maxine', 'Kenny', 'break-up/Maxine', 'confronting', 'LilaAnd', 'most', 'hilarious', 'backstory', 'concerned', 'Lem', 'Bird', 'use', 'massage', 'oil', 'rash.I', 'only', 'CBS/Paramount', 'had', 'added', 'extras', 'interviews', 'back', 'stage', 'segments', 'detailed', 'info', 'regarding', 'what', 'scenes', 'were', 'edited.All', 'spent', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'weekend', 'watching', 'entire', 'series', 'would', 'recommend', 'fans', 'groundbreaking', 'series']",Soul Food: Season 2

At one point I did receive a response and they claimed they had no plans to release season 2 because of poor sales of Season 1, but I refused to give up, and wrote them again, and again, and again.  Not to mention signing the peitions to have the show released.  I guess there is something to being persistent!!!  I was overjoyed when I finally saw an announcement saying Season 2 was being released and I made sure I had my money put aside so I could buy my copy right away.Unlike many of you that watched the show while it aired on Showtime, I never saw the show.  It's hard watching on BET because they edit it so much I know I'm missing some good parts.  I was anxious to know what happened after the car accident.  I finally got the answer and so much more.Being I never saw the show when it originally aired, I honestly don't know what I'm missing with regards to scenes being cut, or the music.  I could tell with at least one episode something was removed, but aside of that I enjoy the DVD set very much.What I would love is some commentary from the actors.  How about some scenes that got cut before it aired, gag reels?  Some extras with the actors discussing how they felt playing their characters would be awesome.So many things were touched upon in Season 2:1.  Damon finally branching out on his own to go into sports management.2.  Byrd trying to expand her business, but not jeopardize her marriage and family life.3.  Lem's mother, whoooooo she is quite a character.4.  Bird dealing with her bladder issue after the surgery, and Lem reaction to her problem.5.  Teri and her anxiety attacks.6.  Maxine runs for Alderman.7.  Lem being the main suspect in the arson of the family store.8.  Lem and Bird embarrassing rash incident.9.  Ahmad and his girl issues.Some of the special guests Michael Jai White as Terri's ex husband Russell.  Kenny ""Babyface"" Edmunds in a sexual discrimination scam. Djimon Honsou as Victor Onuka love interest to Terri and opponent in a case.  Treach as the neighborhood drug dealer, thug.I'm very happy to know that Season 3 will be out next year and I plan to get that as well.  I just hope we won't have to wait too long for the release of Season 4 and 5.
