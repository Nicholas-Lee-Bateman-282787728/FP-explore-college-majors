1005946,ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,B000GNOSD6,Micheal Hunt,"[4, 5]","I used to watch this on TV late at night, and I'm disappointed that this is just the 3 movies and not the whole series. But it will do for now.Hulk Hogan stars as R.J Hurricane Spencer, an ex navy seal who with his friend Brue Baker, also an ex navy seal, have constructed a steal speed boat with allot of technical gadgets that takes a page heavily out of Knight Rider's K.I.T.T, but in the form of a boat.In the first movie the plot evolved around R.J marrying someone to help her save her hotel and kick the bad guys butt at the same time and in the free time making lame jokes and checking out the babes along the Floridian beach they live on. The beach scenes and slow motion women in bikinis looks much like something from Baywatch, probably cause they guy who did Baywatch IS the guy who did this.The second movie there friend Kelly is taken to a foreign land by her new found love, only to discover that he will sacrifice her to save his country by making her marry the local warlord. So R.J and Brue are out for the rescue mission.The 3rd movie see's RJ and Brue capture a Cuban drug lord and send him to prison, then a month later the Cuban drug-lords right arm man holds RJ's daughter hostage at a school with Kelly and other children in exchange for his boss.All in all, the acting is not great. It's pretty lame, but it's entertaining. Some scenes seemed to be done either campy or just dumb on purpose but don't take notes on how to act from any of the main cast. Also in the episodes you see some old WWF wrestlers make small appearances such as Brutus The Barber Beefcake, Jimmy Mouth Of The South Hart, The Anvil Jim Neidhart, The Giant Gonzales, Tugboat/Typhoon and probably a few more. And also that guy who played the guy in the original Avengers series. About the best performance in all of them is Carey Hawuki Tagawa or whatever his name is, he played Shang T-Sung in Mortal Kombat, ya know the guy... well, he's about the only decent actor in the whole thing.But it's fun, ridicules, stupid and funny. Coming on 3 discs isn't necessary,  i think all 3 movies would fit onto the one disc. But oh well, just a cheap cash in and the price is reasonable. Would've been nice to have some bonus features, commentary or even subtitles, but i guess they figure there is only about 10 of us in the world who would buy this thing.What the heck is with that cover? Could they have picked a worse picture to use?",3,So lame it's entertaining,1174348800,"03 20, 2007",2007,2424,"['used', 'watch', 'TV', 'late', 'night', ""'m"", 'disappointed', 'just', '3', 'movies', 'not', 'whole', 'series', 'will', 'do', 'now.Hulk', 'Hogan', 'R.J', 'Hurricane', 'Spencer', 'ex', 'navy', 'seal', 'who', 'friend', 'Brue', 'Baker', 'also', 'ex', 'navy', 'seal', 'have', 'constructed', 'steal', 'speed', 'boat', 'allot', 'technical', 'gadgets', 'page', 'heavily', 'Knight', 'Rider', 'K.I.T.T', 'form', 'boat.In', 'first', 'movie', 'plot', 'evolved', 'R.J', 'marrying', 'someone', 'help', 'save', 'hotel', 'kick', 'bad', 'guys', 'butt', 'same', 'time', 'free', 'time', 'making', 'lame', 'jokes', 'checking', 'out', 'babes', 'Floridian', 'beach', 'live', 'beach', 'scenes', 'slow', 'motion', 'women', 'bikinis', 'looks', 'much', 'something', 'Baywatch', 'probably', 'cause', 'guy', 'who', 'did', 'Baywatch', 'IS', 'guy', 'who', 'did', 'this.The', 'second', 'movie', 'friend', 'Kelly', 'taken', 'foreign', 'land', 'new', 'found', 'love', 'only', 'discover', 'will', 'sacrifice', 'save', 'country', 'making', 'marry', 'local', 'warlord', 'R.J', 'Brue', 'are', 'out', 'rescue', 'mission.The', '3rd', 'movie', 'see', 'RJ', 'Brue', 'capture', 'Cuban', 'drug', 'lord', 'send', 'prison', 'then', 'month', 'later', 'Cuban', 'drug-lords', 'right', 'arm', 'man', 'RJ', 'daughter', 'hostage', 'school', 'Kelly', 'other', 'children', 'exchange', 'boss.All', 'acting', 'not', 'great', 'pretty', 'lame', 'entertaining', 'scenes', 'seemed', 'be', 'done', 'campy', 'just', 'dumb', 'purpose', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'notes', 'how', 'act', 'main', 'cast', 'Also', 'episodes', 'see', 'old', 'WWF', 'wrestlers', 'make', 'small', 'appearances', 'such', 'Brutus', 'Barber', 'Beefcake', 'Jimmy', 'Mouth', 'South', 'Hart', 'Anvil', 'Jim', 'Neidhart', 'Giant', 'Gonzales', 'Tugboat/Typhoon', 'probably', 'few', 'more', 'also', 'guy', 'who', 'played', 'guy', 'original', 'Avengers', 'series', 'best', 'performance', 'Carey', 'Hawuki', 'Tagawa', 'whatever', 'name', 'played', 'Shang', 'T-Sung', 'Mortal', 'Kombat', 'ya', 'know', 'guy', 'well', 'only', 'decent', 'actor', 'whole', 'thing.But', 'fun', 'ridicules', 'stupid', 'funny', 'Coming', '3', 'discs', ""n't"", 'necessary', 'i', 'think', '3', 'movies', 'would', 'fit', 'one', 'disc', 'oh', 'well', 'just', 'cheap', 'cash', 'price', 'reasonable', 'Would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'bonus', 'features', 'commentary', 'even', 'subtitles', 'i', 'guess', 'figure', 'only', 'about', '10', 'world', 'who', 'would', 'buy', 'heck', 'cover', 'Could', 'have', 'picked', 'worse', 'picture', 'use']",Thunder In Paradise 3pk

Chris' comedic talents equal, and sometimes surpass, his father's. It was set locally in Orlando, FL, and though people can pick out inconsistencies or not geographically accurate, the show was so cool! It entertained my youngest daughter, who, at the time, was about 4 and 5 and not yet able to attend Kindergarten, and she actually has never forgotten the show! She was a Hulkamaniac. If you want a show that the whole family can sit, watch, enjoy and feel good after watching, ""Thunder in Paradise"" is for you!
