And most of us had to wait almost a year to get to see the movie, but it's really worth it once you see it.&#34;GBF&#34; becomes an instant teen classic like Mean Girls and Clueless (like it says on the cover), the script is full of awesome lines that will become as classic as the ones from the two teen classics I mentioned. The cast is really great, everyone plays well their role, and even if it GBF becomes goofy at times, they know how to be sensitive to all the gay kids that are out there, this movie is just more than just stereotypes (the film has the typical high school kids: the popular girls, the non-popular kids, the outsiders, the homophobes...), it's about accepting yourself! Although it's a little predictable, the movie still makes you laugh with so many pop culture mentions, and probably if you're only a teen/young adult you will understand the jokes of the movies.I honestly don't care about the clothes the characters wear on a movie or TV shows, but the clothes worn on GBF are awesome; everybody's outfits are great, and I bet they will become as classic as the ones from Clueless!

Despite their being best friends at that time.On a positive note Tanner and Brent played by &#34;Paul Iacono&#34; were adorable and convincing in their roles as newly outed  gay kids in a sea of straight people.They did put a Mean Girls spin on it in that when Tanner became popular for being the popular girls Gay Best Friend he kind of left his two best friends out in the cold and there are of course lessons to be learned such as don't treat a person as a possession or thing instead of a human being with real feelings and emotions just like anyone else.It was an enjoyable film that I would watch again if not just to look at how adorable (Michael J. Willett) as Tanner was in the movie.Also (Sasha Pieterse) as Blonde prom Queen and most popular girl in school Fawcett and (Xosha Roquemore) as  Caprice the African American Diva were both perfect in their roles.

The story is shallow and predictable with weird developments that may have been the result of less than stellar editing.  The characters are thin and one-dimensional.  The portrayals of gays, Mormons, blacks, and every minority group are stereotypical to the point of being offensive.  The make-up artists did a horrible job trying to make these characters look like high school students (the girls were crusty and one of the boys was dolled up like Jerri Blank from Strangers With Candy).

This film does have a young and enthusiastic cast and there  are  good performances  from most of them.  There are the usual problems with the  script. Many of the cast look too old to  be  students at  High School. There are  also the usual  clich&eacute;s with the casting. Have one Asian and one African-American  in the  main cast  just to satisfy  people who think that  there are too many  Caucasians  and not enough  coloured people. Why weren't there more. varied  races in the cast? Let's face it . Do Caucasians make up the majority of  students in  High Schools in Los Angeles? A more multi-racial and  coloured cast  would seem more natural. The casting in the film truly discriminates in this respect. Everyone on the cast are good looking  and look like they come from  wealthy families. Not a true  representation of  the  American population. If this were a British film  then it would have been  more realistic. This film is  just a fluffy  fantasy .,1,This film does have a young and enthusiastic cast and there are good performances from most of them,1405296000,"07 14, 2014",2014,1098,"['Oh', 'Here', 'go', 'again', 'gay', 'movie', 'same', 'sex', 'partners', 'being', 'not', 'allowed', 'go', 'Prom', 'have', 'seen', 'before', 'film', 'have', 'young', 'enthusiastic', 'cast', 'are', 'good', 'performances', 'most', 'are', 'usual', 'problems', 'script', 'Many', 'cast', 'look', 'too', 'old', 'be', 'students', 'High', 'School', 'are', 'also', 'usual', 'clich', 'eacute', 'casting', 'Have', 'one', 'Asian', 'one', 'African-American', 'main', 'cast', 'just', 'satisfy', 'people', 'who', 'think', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'Caucasians', 'not', 'enough', 'coloured', 'people', 'Why', 'were', ""n't"", 'there', 'more', 'varied', 'races', 'cast', 'Let', 'face', 'Do', 'Caucasians', 'make', 'up', 'majority', 'students', 'High', 'Schools', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'more', 'multi-racial', 'coloured', 'cast', 'would', 'seem', 'more', 'natural', 'casting', 'film', 'truly', 'respect', 'Everyone', 'cast', 'are', 'good', 'looking', 'look', 'come', 'wealthy', 'families', 'Not', 'true', 'representation', 'American', 'population', 'were', 'British', 'film', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'realistic', 'film', 'just', 'fluffy', 'fantasy']",GBF

1677660,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B00GB0ORJ8,Tommy Dooley,"[1, 1]","Yes another gay comedy from America and it is actually rather good. Meet Tanner (Michael J. Willet) he is in the closet as is his best mate Brent Van Camp (Paul Iacono). They are students at North Gateway High - the only school in America that does not have an `out' gay. This poses a problem for the fashionista Queen biatches who rule the school and who have all learnt that the latest must have fashion accessory and statement of social coolness is a G.B.F. Yes a gay best friend.As luck would have it the new `Guydar' app is not too far away and as well as helping guys hook up it also allows GBF recruiters to track down their nearest potential recruit. Well as you can guess it is not long before Tanner is outed but with consequences both expected - such as homophobia and unexpected - a totally new cool bunch of friends. And I am glad to say hilarity does ensue.This also tries to take some issues seriously that includes stereotypes, fashion slaves, faith and friendship. The laughs are not constant but there is more than enough to keep your interest. Everyone does a good job in the acting department and Brent's mum is played beautifully by Megan Mullally (`Will and Grace and `30 Rock'). There is no bedroom stuff to worry about and it runs for just over an hour and a half. This is light hearted fun that will not reveal anything new but should raise a smile - recommended.",4,When fashion demands something more - a GBF,1398902400,"05 1, 2014",2014,1388,"['Yes', 'gay', 'comedy', 'America', 'actually', 'rather', 'good', 'Meet', 'Tanner', 'Michael', 'J.', 'Willet', 'closet', 'best', 'mate', 'Brent', 'Van', 'Camp', 'Paul', 'Iacono', 'are', 'students', 'North', 'Gateway', 'High', 'only', 'school', 'America', 'not', 'have', 'out', 'gay', 'problem', 'fashionista', 'Queen', 'biatches', 'who', 'rule', 'school', 'who', 'have', 'learnt', 'latest', 'must', 'have', 'fashion', 'accessory', 'statement', 'social', 'coolness', 'G.B.F', 'Yes', 'gay', 'best', 'friend.As', 'luck', 'would', 'have', 'new', 'Guydar', 'app', 'not', 'too', 'far', 'away', 'as', 'well', 'helping', 'guys', 'hook', 'up', 'also', 'GBF', 'recruiters', 'track', 'down', 'nearest', 'potential', 'recruit', 'Well', 'can', 'guess', 'not', 'long', 'Tanner', 'outed', 'consequences', 'expected', 'such', 'homophobia', 'unexpected', 'totally', 'new', 'cool', 'bunch', 'friends', 'am', 'glad', 'say', 'hilarity', 'ensue.This', 'also', 'take', 'issues', 'seriously', 'stereotypes', 'fashion', 'slaves', 'faith', 'friendship', 'laughs', 'are', 'not', 'constant', 'more', 'enough', 'keep', 'interest', 'Everyone', 'good', 'job', 'acting', 'department', 'Brent', 'mum', 'played', 'beautifully', 'Megan', 'Mullally', 'Will', 'Grace', '30', 'Rock', 'bedroom', 'stuff', 'worry', 'about', 'just', 'hour', 'half', 'light', 'hearted', 'fun', 'will', 'not', 'reveal', 'anything', 'new', 'should', 'raise', 'smile', 'recommended']",GBF
