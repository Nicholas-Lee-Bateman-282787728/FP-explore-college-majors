The other reviewers did a great job, but left out one important thing---MoMo is not just a bum who found a home by acting as a womans' pet--the character is actually a famous dancer who loves the woman, and values living with her as much or more than being famous.  He doesn't really tell her who he is, just lets her find out slowly. MatsuJun is wonderful in this---I liked him better here than in Hana Yori Dango. In Hana you see him get wild and crazy because he has a terrible temper. In this, you see him get wild and crazy because he's happy (mostly). He's a one man comedy who also manages to be sexy no matter what he's doing.BTW---what I've said is not a spoiler, as, WE  know who MoMo is almost right away.You will also get to see some of Matsujuns' powerful and utterly exquisite ballet! I think he and Jang Geun Suk are two of the most graceful men on the planet.Sakai Wakana Koiyuchi is very beautiful and perfect for the the female lead.I've also seen the Korean movie You're My Pet, and I didn't like it because they made the leading lady just too mean, and it really bothered me. If she treated an actual dog the way she treated her pet boy, even just in the movie, there would be a huge backlash against that movie.I don't know how reflective this is of Korean culture-whether it's exaggerated or not, but, women, young and old are frequently hitting people in Korean dramas-and I mean really hitting-and it bothers me.The Japanese drama is much better.",5,Really Really good,1335225600,"04 24, 2012",2012,1494,"['absolutely', 'love', 'other', 'reviewers', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'left', 'out', 'one', 'important', 'thing', '-MoMo', 'not', 'just', 'bum', 'who', 'found', 'home', 'acting', 'womans', 'pet', 'character', 'actually', 'famous', 'dancer', 'who', 'woman', 'values', 'living', 'as', 'much', 'more', 'being', 'famous', ""n't"", 'really', 'tell', 'who', 'just', 'find', 'out', 'slowly', 'MatsuJun', 'wonderful', '-I', 'liked', 'better', 'here', 'Hana', 'Yori', 'Dango', 'Hana', 'see', 'get', 'wild', 'crazy', 'terrible', 'temper', 'see', 'get', 'wild', 'crazy', 'happy', 'mostly', 'one', 'man', 'comedy', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'sexy', 'matter', 'what', 'doing.BTW', '-what', ""'ve"", 'said', 'not', 'spoiler', 'WE', 'know', 'who', 'MoMo', 'almost', 'right', 'away.You', 'will', 'also', 'get', 'see', 'Matsujuns', 'powerful', 'utterly', 'exquisite', 'ballet', 'think', 'Jang', 'Geun', 'Suk', 'are', 'two', 'most', 'graceful', 'men', 'planet.Sakai', 'Wakana', 'Koiyuchi', 'very', 'beautiful', 'perfect', 'female', 'lead.I', ""'ve"", 'also', 'seen', 'Korean', 'movie', ""'re"", 'Pet', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'made', 'leading', 'lady', 'just', 'too', 'mean', 'really', 'bothered', 'treated', 'actual', 'dog', 'way', 'treated', 'pet', 'boy', 'even', 'just', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'huge', 'backlash', 'movie.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'reflective', 'Korean', 'culture-whether', 'exaggerated', 'not', 'women', 'young', 'old', 'are', 'frequently', 'hitting', 'people', 'Korean', 'dramas-and', 'mean', 'really', 'hitting-and', 'me.The', 'Japanese', 'drama', 'much', 'better']",Pet Lover / Kimi wa Petto Japanese Tv Drama with English Sub (Boxset) NTSC All Region

1346104,A209J4NK7GR9S3,B003I3H7LG,Lovely D.M.,"[0, 0]","Kimi Wa Petto is a show that I might have never watched, if I were to just take its premise. For all intents and purposes the plot summary sounds sort of crazy. However I am glad I took the chance and watched this, because the premise really does not do this show justice. Despite the premise, this show is executed really really well.Takeshi (H) in this never comes off as unattractive (as the premise might make one think), and Sumire (h) never comes off as unlikable/rude because the viewer can always feel her vulnerability and loneliness. As this cute and heartfelt show progresses, we see how Sumire becomes emotionally attached to Takeshi. He is the only one she can be herself with, and he is the only one she can cry in front.The ending *some spoilers* has Takeshi giving up a very good dancing opportunity which would have required him to move away, so that he can stay close to Sumire. I wished that the ending had shown their relationship completely beyond the ""Momo"" comedic/weird setting, instead of almost there.The story is comedic/romantic/moving and above all it's heartfelt. I really like this show, because it really is good.",4,Really Well Done,1369008000,"05 20, 2013",2013,1145,"['Kimi', 'Wa', 'Petto', 'show', 'might', 'have', 'never', 'watched', 'were', 'just', 'take', 'premise', 'intents', 'plot', 'summary', 'sort', 'crazy', 'However', 'am', 'glad', 'took', 'chance', 'watched', 'premise', 'really', 'not', 'do', 'show', 'justice', 'premise', 'show', 'executed', 'really', 'really', 'well.Takeshi', 'H', 'never', 'off', 'unattractive', 'premise', 'might', 'make', 'one', 'think', 'Sumire', 'h', 'never', 'off', 'unlikable/rude', 'viewer', 'can', 'always', 'feel', 'vulnerability', 'loneliness', 'cute', 'heartfelt', 'show', 'see', 'how', 'Sumire', 'emotionally', 'attached', 'Takeshi', 'only', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'can', 'cry', 'front.The', 'ending', '*some', 'spoilers*', 'Takeshi', 'giving', 'up', 'very', 'good', 'dancing', 'opportunity', 'would', 'have', 'required', 'move', 'away', 'can', 'stay', 'close', 'Sumire', 'wished', 'ending', 'had', 'shown', 'relationship', 'completely', 'Momo', 'comedic/weird', 'setting', 'instead', 'almost', 'there.The', 'story', 'comedic/romantic/moving', 'heartfelt', 'really', 'show', 'really', 'good']",Pet Lover / Kimi wa Petto Japanese Tv Drama with English Sub (Boxset) NTSC All Region

I got mine 3 days before the estimated delivery date, in perfect working order.This is a very fun and sweet romantic comedy that should appeal to women of all ages. Sumire is a smart, successful but lonely professional woman.  After a particularly hard day (she's had lunch with her ex-fiancee, who left her for another woman, and been hit on by her sleazy boss) she finds a young homeless man unconscious in a box outside her apartment building. She patches him up and lets him sleep on her couch for the night. The next day he begs her to let him stay. She reluctantly agrees, but only if he will stay as a ""pet"" - he will have no rights, he must obey her at all times, and sex is out of the question. In return, she will care for him and feed him. To her surprise, he agrees. She names him ""Momo"" after her childhood dog, and he calls her ""Master"".Her best friend is skeptical about the relationship--how can she let a total stranger into her home?--but it works for them. ""Momo"" gets free room and board, and Sumire gets the unconditional affection she's been missing. Momo is kind of useless as a human being--he can't even wash dishes without breaking them--but he kind of works as a pet. He's a good listener, he intuitively senses his ""owner's"" moods, and he's always happy to see her when she comes home. Then a Sumire's former colleague moves back to town and asks her out. The new guy is everything she is looking for in a man--tall, good looking and successful--but she just can't seem to be herself around him. She's always cutting their dates short in order to run home and spend more quality time with her ""pet"". Ironically, cardboard box guy understands her better than either her former or current boyfriend. Can he make her see him as a human before it's too late?P.S. I watched this with my 81-year-old mother, who also really enjoyed it.

1346107,A3EX36SNRYD5VL,B003I3H7LG,"TammyJo Eckhart ""TammyJo Eckhart""","[2, 2]","I was a huge fan of the manga this Japanese TV series was drawn from and I looked for it for years.  Very recently I found it on a fansub site and enjoyed it then realized I couldn't risk losing it so I had to buy a copy if I could.  The DVDs I bought were primarily in good condition, there was a one or two second date glitch in episode five, but otherwise this was in solid condition.  The DVD do not offer any thing extra -- no behind the scenes, no interviews, no commentary -- but I'm not a big fan of those any way.The show itself is generally well paced though the final episode is a bit rushed.  The two main actors, Yoyuki and Matasumoto Jun, are excellent in their embodiment of Sumire and Momo. In several ways the TV series diverges from the manga but in ways which I think fit better for a ten episode show set in 2003.  The show really dies into the conflict of individual versus social expectations based on sex, age, and education that I find revealing even after watching it several times.The four star rating though is for the English subtitles on the DVD.  I watched the series first fansubbed and to be blunt, the fans did a much better job, subtitling signs, books, and especially the episode titles that are all missed in the official DVD.  However the official DVD also is not cluttered with all the subtitles in other languages I found on the fansites.  An official DVD though should go above and beyond this quality of subtitles.I highly recommend this series and I'd be thrilled if they made a follow-up series to show us how Momo and Sumire are doing in let's say 2013, a decade later.",4,"Excellent Story, Weak Subtitles",1326931200,"01 19, 2012",2012,1613,"['was', 'huge', 'fan', 'manga', 'Japanese', 'TV', 'series', 'was', 'drawn', 'looked', 'years', 'Very', 'recently', 'found', 'fansub', 'site', 'enjoyed', 'then', 'realized', 'could', ""n't"", 'risk', 'losing', 'had', 'buy', 'copy', 'could', 'DVDs', 'bought', 'were', 'primarily', 'good', 'condition', 'was', 'one', 'two', 'second', 'date', 'glitch', 'episode', 'five', 'otherwise', 'was', 'solid', 'condition', 'DVD', 'do', 'not', 'offer', 'thing', 'extra', 'scenes', 'interviews', 'commentary', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'way.The', 'show', 'generally', 'well', 'paced', 'final', 'episode', 'bit', 'rushed', 'two', 'main', 'actors', 'Yoyuki', 'Matasumoto', 'Jun', 'are', 'excellent', 'embodiment', 'Sumire', 'Momo', 'several', 'ways', 'TV', 'series', 'diverges', 'manga', 'ways', 'think', 'fit', 'better', 'ten', 'episode', 'show', 'set', '2003', 'show', 'really', 'conflict', 'individual', 'versus', 'social', 'expectations', 'based', 'sex', 'age', 'education', 'find', 'revealing', 'even', 'watching', 'several', 'times.The', 'four', 'star', 'rating', 'though', 'English', 'subtitles', 'DVD', 'watched', 'series', 'first', 'fansubbed', 'be', 'blunt', 'fans', 'did', 'much', 'better', 'job', 'subtitling', 'signs', 'books', 'especially', 'episode', 'titles', 'are', 'missed', 'official', 'DVD', 'However', 'official', 'DVD', 'also', 'not', 'cluttered', 'subtitles', 'other', 'languages', 'found', 'fansites', 'official', 'DVD', 'though', 'should', 'go', 'quality', 'subtitles.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'series', ""'d"", 'be', 'thrilled', 'made', 'follow-up', 'series', 'show', 'how', 'Momo', 'Sumire', 'are', 'doing', 'let', 'say', '2013', 'decade', 'later']",Pet Lover / Kimi wa Petto Japanese Tv Drama with English Sub (Boxset) NTSC All Region
