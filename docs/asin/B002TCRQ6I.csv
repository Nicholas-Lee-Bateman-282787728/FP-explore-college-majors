The first episode, ""Selam"", shows how clues from the remains of a 3 million year-old child suggest why and how humanity first came down from the trees and started walking upright. The second episode applies forensics to the mystery of ""Turkana Boy"", a fossil of Home erectus, the first human ancestor to leave Africa and begin colonization of the globe. What caused this African exodus? The final episode, ""Becoming Human"", examines how human capacities for art, invention, and survival developed, and the mystery of humanity's interaction with the early Neanderthals. Did humans interbreed with Neanderthals, or cause their extermination? Why did ""we"" survive when other ancestral cousins died out? An extraordinary collection, and a choice pick especially for public library DVD collections and the libraries of anyone curious about the origins of humanity in prehistoric times. 3 hours, widescreen, closed captioned. Also highly recommended is the NOVA documentary ""What Are Dreams?

Lots of good narration and animation, as well as the interesting patterns of migration of early humans throughout the world.  The later bits about climate change and adaptability, I'm sure were added or amplified at the sponsor's request...  since, it demonstrated that dramatic climate change has happened before, and that as a result - humans not only survived, but improved.  The take-away message is that even though climate change is dramatic, we will find a way to adapt and thrive.  And this is something a lot of scientists would disagree with, because it doesn't talk about human-induced climate change.  It talks about long-term changes over tens of thousands of years.  Not 50 or 100.  So while there's a lot of good science in this series, the end is a bit misleading and disingenuous.  Look at who sponsored it and take it with a large grain of salt.

On location photography, interviews with renowned experts, and computer-generated animation allow viewers to better understand how Homo Sapiens became the final (read current) outcome of a long evolution spread over millions of years.  Viewers should not be surprised that this investigation of our ancestors will be the subject of an updated documentary.  For example, the researchers of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology recently revised their initial conclusions that there was no interbreeding at all between Homo Sapiens and Homo Neanderthalis based on their further study of their respective ADN.
