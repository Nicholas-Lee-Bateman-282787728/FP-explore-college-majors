He knew how to count before we got it (he is 4), but this video really taught him the concept of counting - not just memorizing the numbers. My son also surprised me when the little girl Lilly was showing her father how to count to 10 by counting along with her. He knows how to count to 15 really well and now we are working up to 20.It is very sweet and like-able and has some catchy songs. It really is a wonderful learning video for children. It is timeless and will last for many years while many others could be dated. It emphasizes the numbers and children really do learn.

She has learned to count to 20, and a major reason was this video. I highly recommend it. It is the best counting video I've found.The animation is basic (and even slightly glitchy in one instance), but it's not the sort of thing little kids care about. The content and educational value are first-rate. Our daughter loves the sweet animal characters.We like that the presentation is low-key, not like some of the loud, frenetically paced stuff you see nowadays. If your kids see a lot of TV, they might have a different reaction than our daughter did to this video. We don't let her watch a lot of video unless it's educational (studies show TV and rapidly changing video images are not healthy for kids' brain development, especially before age 3).",5,Great way to learn counting,1104624000,"01 2, 2005",2005,850,"['two-year', 'old', 'daughter', 'video', 'always', 'asking', 'see', 'bunny', 'counting', 'video', 'learned', 'count', '20', 'major', 'reason', 'was', 'video', 'highly', 'recommend', 'best', 'counting', 'video', ""'ve"", 'found.The', 'animation', 'basic', 'even', 'slightly', 'glitchy', 'one', 'instance', 'not', 'sort', 'thing', 'little', 'kids', 'care', 'content', 'educational', 'value', 'are', 'first-rate', 'daughter', 'sweet', 'animal', 'characters.We', 'presentation', 'low-key', 'not', 'loud', 'frenetically', 'paced', 'stuff', 'see', 'nowadays', 'kids', 'see', 'lot', 'TV', 'might', 'have', 'different', 'reaction', 'daughter', 'did', 'video', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'watch', 'lot', 'video', 'educational', 'studies', 'show', 'TV', 'rapidly', 'changing', 'video', 'images', 'are', 'not', 'healthy', 'kids', 'brain', 'development', 'especially', 'before', 'age', '3']",N/A

Every single kid loves it.It has the same characters as the Scarry books. The kids' voices seem real without being too cute or weirdly adult (like the odd Peanuts kids' voices are.) The video has a very calm and mellow feel. Not boring, just smooth, understated and engaging. No whiz bang hijinks or frantic mugging. The kids just get absorbed in it and it holds their attention for its full length.The kid characters are well-behaved and adults are caring, trustworthy and capable. If there is any message besides the actual counting it is that effort is rewarded, school is fun and learning is worthwhile.

The ABC's video is slightly better than this one (in my opinion) but my son adores them both and watches them back to back (we watch ABC's then he asks for the Counting DVD). My son already knew most of his ABC's (I'm using that DVD for reading as well) but he could only count to 10 and only recognized numbers up to 5. We haven't had these DVD's for a week yet and my son's already recognizing his numbers upto 10 and repeats the higher numbers. I recommend this DVD OVER Sesame Street's 123 Count With me that basically only goes upto 15 (except for a counting song that goes upto 20) but my son loves that DVD as well.
