If you're the same then you have to see this movie. Some say this movie won't really bring any closure to the series or explain what's really going on, but that doesn't matter. The whole point of this movie is to truly help you develop greater appreciation for an excellent love story. After watching it you could understand the story a bit more though you really notice the relationships and feelings of the characters more in depth. The movie kept all the important scenes that portrayed that concept. The whole story with the Mu invasion, the Xephons, the instrumentalist, and the tuning of the whole world, (sorry to those if I may have given too much away), only work as a back drop to better express this scenario. There are people torn between their feeling for one person and another. In a sense all the turmoil seems to help emphasize this, and only when they all become true to their emotions does everything become tranquil you can say. So check this movie out if you're still lost about the reason for why RahXephon is about all this crap. The only way to find closure to a story is to read it from the beginning. Even if the stories condensed a little, well that's just my opinion. I give it 4 stars.",4,Appreciation,1098316800,"10 21, 2004",2004,1405,"['must', 'admit', 'when', 'watched', 'RahXephon', 'series', 'only', 'caught', 'last', '15', 'episodes', 'truly', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'hell', 'was', 'watching', 'knew', 'liked', 'reason', ""'re"", 'same', 'then', 'have', 'see', 'movie', 'say', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'really', 'bring', 'closure', 'series', 'explain', 'what', 'really', 'going', ""n't"", 'matter', 'whole', 'point', 'movie', 'truly', 'help', 'develop', 'greater', 'appreciation', 'excellent', 'love', 'story', 'watching', 'could', 'understand', 'story', 'bit', 'more', 'really', 'notice', 'relationships', 'feelings', 'characters', 'more', 'depth', 'movie', 'kept', 'important', 'scenes', 'portrayed', 'concept', 'whole', 'story', 'Mu', 'invasion', 'Xephons', 'instrumentalist', 'tuning', 'whole', 'world', 'sorry', 'may', 'have', 'given', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'only', 'work', 'back', 'drop', 'better', 'express', 'scenario', 'are', 'people', 'torn', 'feeling', 'one', 'person', 'sense', 'turmoil', 'help', 'emphasize', 'only', 'when', 'become', 'true', 'emotions', 'everything', 'become', 'can', 'say', 'So', 'check', 'movie', ""'re"", 'still', 'lost', 'reason', 'why', 'RahXephon', 'crap', 'only', 'way', 'find', 'closure', 'story', 'read', 'beginning', 'Even', 'stories', 'condensed', 'little', 'well', 'just', 'opinion', 'give', '4', 'stars']",Rahxephon -  The Motion Picture + Series Box and Book

Based on the hit television series that ran in 2001, the movie is not so much a rehash of the 26 episodes as it is a slightly expanded retelling of the story. Fans of the series and those who missed the show will enjoy the film as it offers something to both groups. Fans will of course want to learn more about the world of Tokyo Jupiter and newer fans have a great starting point to Rahxephon.RahXephon tells the story of Ayato Kamina and his struggle to understand the world he lives in. Starting out as an ordinary school boy, his world is changed when Tokyo is attecked by invaders. Through a series of events he learns the world is much more than it seems and so is his part to play.The RahXephon movie features great Dolem (mecha) action sequences and drama. There are some great comedic moments also to help balance the mood.Yoko Kanno (of cowboy bebop, wolf's rain fame) and Maaya Sakamoto return to music duties and have created the amazing ending theme ""tune the rainbow.""While some may find the plot convoluted at times, RahXephon is a great film filled with mystery, intrigue and excitement.",5,Amazing!,1088467200,"06 29, 2004",2004,1186,"['RaHxephon', 'motion', 'picture', 'viewers', 'back', 'world', 'Tokyo', 'Jupiter', 'Based', 'hit', 'television', 'series', 'ran', '2001', 'movie', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'rehash', '26', 'episodes', 'slightly', 'expanded', 'retelling', 'story', 'Fans', 'series', 'who', 'missed', 'show', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'something', 'groups', 'Fans', 'will', 'course', 'want', 'learn', 'more', 'world', 'Tokyo', 'Jupiter', 'newer', 'fans', 'have', 'great', 'starting', 'point', 'Rahxephon.RahXephon', 'story', 'Ayato', 'Kamina', 'struggle', 'understand', 'world', 'Starting', 'out', 'ordinary', 'school', 'boy', 'world', 'changed', 'when', 'Tokyo', 'attecked', 'invaders', 'series', 'events', 'world', 'much', 'more', 'so', 'part', 'play.The', 'RahXephon', 'movie', 'great', 'Dolem', 'mecha', 'action', 'sequences', 'drama', 'are', 'great', 'comedic', 'moments', 'also', 'help', 'balance', 'mood.Yoko', 'Kanno', 'cowboy', 'bebop', 'wolf', 'rain', 'fame', 'Maaya', 'Sakamoto', 'return', 'music', 'duties', 'have', 'created', 'amazing', 'ending', 'theme', 'rainbow', 'may', 'find', 'plot', 'convoluted', 'times', 'RahXephon', 'great', 'film', 'filled', 'mystery', 'intrigue', 'excitement']",Rahxephon -  The Motion Picture + Series Box and Book

The series was great and I think the movie, though it was a little bit different view interpritation on the story line from the series, is just as good as the series.  I don't think alot of people truly understood the series and probably would not have as great of appricitation for this movie as other might.  However if you were a fan of the 30 some episide long series, than the RahXephon movie (which runs alittle over 2 hours) is a must see.  If you have not seen the series yet, it might be better to try to watch the it first and keep an open mind.  Though the similarities to series such as Evangellian are there, RahXephon is truly in a league of it's own and should not be compared to past anime series!!

828584,AP06CV30OE7CU,B00029NMNG,kairu,"[2, 2]","The producers did a decent job of squeezing an incredibly complex (and, at times, incredibly confusing) anime into a concise two-hour movie.That said, Rahxephon The Motion Picture differs dramatically from the series in several crucial respects, particularly in the relationship between Ayato and Haruka. (Without giving too much away, I'll say that Ayato and Haruka get more intimate -- a LOT more intimate -- in the film than in the series. This wouldn't be a problem, except for the fact that he's 17 and she's 29, meaning, um, she could be charged with statutory rape in many parts of the world.)It's not a bad film, all things considered, but take my advice: Watch the series instead.",3,The Cliffs Notes version of Rahxephon,1093046400,"08 21, 2004",2004,689,"['producers', 'did', 'decent', 'job', 'squeezing', 'incredibly', 'complex', 'times', 'incredibly', 'confusing', 'anime', 'concise', 'two-hour', 'movie.That', 'said', 'Rahxephon', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'differs', 'dramatically', 'series', 'several', 'crucial', 'respects', 'particularly', 'relationship', 'Ayato', 'Haruka', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', ""'ll"", 'say', 'Ayato', 'Haruka', 'get', 'more', 'intimate', 'LOT', 'more', 'intimate', 'film', 'series', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'problem', 'fact', '17', '29', 'meaning', 'um', 'could', 'be', 'charged', 'statutory', 'rape', 'many', 'parts', 'world', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'things', 'considered', 'take', 'advice', 'Watch', 'series', 'instead']",Rahxephon -  The Motion Picture + Series Box and Book

I find my impressions are mixed, but that overall the film provides a different angle on the original story. One that touches more on emotional factors, and ekes out several things that are easy to miss in the series.The plot, for those who haven't seen the series, is the tale of Ayato Kamina, who is caught in Tokyo during an alien invasion. The city is separated from the rest of the world, and the human inhabitants are convinced that they are the only survivors. When Ayato reaches the age of 17, a sudden meeting with a secret agent (Haruka Shitow) turns his world upside down. He discovers the truth and finds that he is connected with a giant robotic creature called the RahXephon.He leaves Tokyo to aid humanity in stopping the aliens (Mu). Ayato is an instrumentalist, half human half Mulan, and badly torn over the path he should follow and his true nature. He is haunted by an old relationship and faces a complicated, metaphysical crisis or two.What I especially liked -The story isn't exactly different, but it focuses much better on the abridged romance between Haruka and Ayato. In the series, which has time to develop the detailed characters better, let time is spent on this theme. There are hints along the way, but only at the end does it achieve prominence. In the film Ayato's female relationships are the key element. This clarifies some of the confusion of the series.One the other hand -Either there was a very poor transfer or the film was made with sloppier artwork. Nor is the music of the same quality. Character development is seriously abridged, as is often the case in a feature length version. There are several cases, though, where it would have been better to leave out a character entirely. And poor Quon Kisaragi is barely a shadow of her series self, which is a shame. And finally there are some monologues which try to be lectures on the theory behind the action. These border on the tedious.Since you aren't going to buy this package unless you intend to or already own the series, you will be pleased with the entire Rahxephon experience whether you like the film or not this won't be a disappointment.  Collectors, after all, are happiest when they are collecting.",4,The Parts Are Sometimes Better Than The Whole,1100131200,"11 11, 2004",2004,2315,"['be', 'quite', 'difference', 'opinion', 'two-hour', 'feature', 'film', 'based', 'RahXephon', 'series', 'find', 'impressions', 'are', 'mixed', 'overall', 'film', 'different', 'angle', 'original', 'story', 'One', 'more', 'emotional', 'factors', 'out', 'several', 'things', 'are', 'easy', 'miss', 'series.The', 'plot', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'series', 'tale', 'Ayato', 'Kamina', 'who', 'caught', 'Tokyo', 'alien', 'invasion', 'city', 'separated', 'rest', 'world', 'human', 'inhabitants', 'are', 'convinced', 'are', 'only', 'survivors', 'When', 'Ayato', 'age', '17', 'sudden', 'meeting', 'secret', 'agent', 'Haruka', 'Shitow', 'world', 'upside', 'down', 'truth', 'connected', 'giant', 'robotic', 'creature', 'called', 'RahXephon.He', 'Tokyo', 'aid', 'humanity', 'stopping', 'aliens', 'Mu', 'Ayato', 'instrumentalist', 'half', 'human', 'half', 'Mulan', 'badly', 'torn', 'path', 'should', 'follow', 'true', 'nature', 'haunted', 'old', 'relationship', 'complicated', 'metaphysical', 'crisis', 'especially', 'liked', '-The', 'story', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'different', 'much', 'better', 'abridged', 'romance', 'Haruka', 'Ayato', 'series', 'time', 'develop', 'detailed', 'characters', 'better', 'let', 'time', 'spent', 'theme', 'are', 'hints', 'way', 'only', 'end', 'achieve', 'prominence', 'film', 'Ayato', 'female', 'relationships', 'are', 'key', 'element', 'confusion', 'series.One', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'very', 'poor', 'transfer', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'sloppier', 'artwork', 'music', 'same', 'quality', 'Character', 'development', 'seriously', 'abridged', 'often', 'case', 'feature', 'length', 'version', 'are', 'several', 'cases', 'though', 'where', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'leave', 'out', 'character', 'entirely', 'poor', 'Quon', 'Kisaragi', 'barely', 'shadow', 'series', 'self', 'shame', 'finally', 'are', 'monologues', 'try', 'be', 'lectures', 'theory', 'action', 'border', 'tedious.Since', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'buy', 'package', 'intend', 'already', 'own', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'pleased', 'entire', 'Rahxephon', 'experience', 'film', 'not', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointment', 'Collectors', 'are', 'happiest', 'when', 'are', 'collecting']",Rahxephon -  The Motion Picture + Series Box and Book
