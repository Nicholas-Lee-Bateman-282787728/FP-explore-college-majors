778738,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B0000DI880,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[0, 3]","One has to wonder what possessed Robert Duvall to write himself such a despicable part; unlike his &quot;The Apostle&quot;, in which the character had some light mixed in with the darkness, his John Anderson, a hot headed loose cannon slimy hit man, is 100% horrible. Perhaps his relationship with his girlfriend's 10 year old Jenny is supposed to be the &quot;light&quot; part, but that just further increased my discomfort with this character; would you leave your beautiful little daughter with Anderson ? Scary thought. The girlfriend, well played by Kathy Baker, is hopelessly nave, or pretending to be, as she seemingly believes his lies...perhaps it's the best she thinks she can do as a single mother manicurist.Elephants could tread through the holes in the plot, the script meanders, and the editing is erratic. The &quot;plot&quot; concerns a man who is sent 5,250 miles from Brooklyn to Argentina for a &quot;job&quot;; the reasons for this, and who is the final target, get more confused as the film unfolds, and when at a loss for words, which is often, they rely on obscenities. Many of the scenes seem to be improvised, and not too many of them succeed.Out of this 1 hour and 54 minute film, there are approximately 15 marvelous minutes, and they take place on the dance floor. The principal dancer to thank is the stunning Luciana Pedraza as Manuela, whose fluid grace and lovely form will delight anyone who appreciates dance; other terrific dancers include Geraldine Rojas, who plays Manuela's sister Pirucha, and the great Pablo Veron, who dances while the end credits roll, and makes us wish that more time had been spent on the tango, and less on a bad tempered assassin.

I found it even more fascinating than I hoped, thanks to a totally-unknown actress. Two viewings within a year has not changed my opinion.This movie is just different, a unique portrait of strange older hit-man and the people in his life. I am not surprised a number of viewers did not like this film, even fans of Robert Duvall. It's probably just too quirky for most tastes and too slow for most viewers. Despite being low- key, there are some moments of intense temper and violence on the part of Duvall which helps keep ones attention.I didn't need that, however, to keep my attention. Just trying to figure out Duvall kept me intrigued. My attention, however, accelerated when newcomer Luciana Pedraza entered the picture.Pedraza is one of the most interesting ""new faces"" I've seen on film: a woman who has intelligence written over her face as few modern actresses ever have. This woman has a lot to offer: looks, intelligence, a good figure, a great dancer, wonderful voice and despite being Argentine, speaks better English than many Americans. A pity that to my knowledge, this is still her only screen appearance.Between her and Duvall - who are both complex characters to say the least - along with some wonderfully-colorful cinematography, great dance scenes and intrigue about how an assassination plot will turn out,I found this film and the DVD - which is inexpensive - very pleasing.This is unknown film that isn't fully appreciated.",5,Pedraza Alone Worth The Price Of The DVD,1145059200,"04 15, 2006",2006,1561,"['took', 'shot', 'buying', 'DVD', 'sight-unseen', 'something', 'rarely', 'do', 'usually', 'regret', 'not', 'case', 'found', 'even', 'more', 'fascinating', 'hoped', 'thanks', 'totally-unknown', 'actress', 'Two', 'viewings', 'year', 'not', 'changed', 'opinion.This', 'movie', 'just', 'different', 'unique', 'portrait', 'strange', 'older', 'hit-man', 'people', 'life', 'am', 'not', 'surprised', 'number', 'viewers', 'did', 'not', 'film', 'even', 'fans', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'probably', 'just', 'too', 'quirky', 'most', 'tastes', 'too', 'slow', 'most', 'viewers', 'being', 'low-', 'key', 'are', 'moments', 'intense', 'temper', 'violence', 'part', 'Duvall', 'keep', 'ones', 'attention.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'however', 'keep', 'attention', 'Just', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'Duvall', 'kept', 'intrigued', 'attention', 'however', 'accelerated', 'when', 'newcomer', 'Luciana', 'Pedraza', 'entered', 'picture.Pedraza', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'new', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'woman', 'who', 'intelligence', 'written', 'face', 'few', 'modern', 'actresses', 'ever', 'have', 'woman', 'lot', 'offer', 'looks', 'intelligence', 'good', 'figure', 'great', 'dancer', 'wonderful', 'voice', 'being', 'Argentine', 'better', 'English', 'many', 'Americans', 'pity', 'knowledge', 'still', 'only', 'screen', 'Duvall', 'who', 'are', 'complex', 'characters', 'say', 'least', 'wonderfully-colorful', 'cinematography', 'great', 'dance', 'scenes', 'intrigue', 'how', 'assassination', 'plot', 'will', 'turn', 'out', 'found', 'film', 'DVD', 'inexpensive', 'very', 'pleasing.This', 'unknown', 'film', ""n't"", 'fully', 'appreciated']",N/A

He fills the screen and it is virtually impossible for any other actor to upstage him.  This films reminds me of the time when Richard Burton read off the names in a phone book---and the audience was held spellbound by the late thespian&#65533;s ability to make such a normally boring event seem wildly interesting.  &#65533;Assassination Tango&#65533; lacks coherence and is something of a rambling mess.  And yet, I found the experience highly rewarding.Duvall is a director of modest talent.  The movie is supposedly about a overage professional killer who must travel to Argentina to assassinate a retired general who is allegedly guilty of crimes against humanity.  None of this ever makes any logical sense.  But the dancing and the beautiful cinematography are exhilarating.  Duvall has the extraordinary talent to turn meandering dialogues into riveting scenes.  We are entranced by his character&#65533;s adoration of the girlfriend&#65533;s daughter.  The flirtations between John J. Anderson (Duvall) and the gorgeous and significantly younger tango instructor Manuella (Luciana Pedraza) are poignant and even a bit touching.  &#65533;Assassination Tango&#65533; is definitely not for everyone.  I give it four stars, and recommend it only to those who believe that great acting alone can salvage a less than well put together script.  In many respects &#65533;Assassination Tango&#65533; is nothing more than Robert Duvall&#65533;s grandiose ego trip.

Unfortunately, such involvement often obscures objectivity on the part of the film-maker, and that seems to be the case here. Duvall plays a hitman sent to Argentina for his latest job. The tango subplot really has nothing to do with the assassination plot (other than the weak link that, having to put off the assassination for several days, the hitman spends his time in a tango club and befriending a tango dancer); or perhaps it's that the assassination subplot has nothing to do with the tango plot. There are too many unexplained elements in the plot (for example, why were the Argentinian contacts apparently trying to set him up?), and while not everything need to be spoonfed to the viewer, a film like this still ought to have some coherent plot line.

The tango is memory and passion, the perfect combination of light and shadow. The fusion of the couple, wild and captivating, hard to evade and easy to engage us.The plot will follow the classic style: Duvall is a hired mercenary. He will be sent from New York to Buenos Aires to pay a painful debt. But the fascinating portrait made by Duvall is unique, very personal and warmth, through smart dialogues and a very well assembled script , that will capture your interest.There are certain edition problems and unnecessary concessions, that avoid to know a little more about this retired General; may be a flash back would have been enough; and that is why I guess this was not the main intention of Duvall; he wants to focus about the tango, and the crime won't be but the frame of the dramatis personae.He is a beloved father behind his job.

778754,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B0000DI880,Joseph Haschka,"[18, 20]","Actor Robert Duvall apparently has a liking for the tango dance, and wanted to share his passion with the world via a film. However, perhaps he felt that something needed to be added to the storyline to reach a wider audience. Thus, as writer, director, and producer of ASSASSINATION TANGO, he added another plot - or is it a subplot? - about a professional killer hired for a South American wet job.Duvall plays John Anderson, an aging hit man in the employ of Big Apple mobster, Frankie (Frank Gio). The light of Anderson's life is 10-year old Jenny (Katherine Miller), the daughter of his significant other, Maggie (Kathy Baker). Though Jenny's birthday is the following week,  John accepts an assignment in Argentina to whack a retired general. Frankie assures him that the job should only take three days - a quick down and back in time for birthday cake and presents. However, once in Buenos Aires, the hit is postponed, and John must cool his heels for three weeks. During that period, Anderson's anger over the delay dissipates as he discovers the tango. Or rather, as he re-discovers the tango, which is more structured and passionately choreographed in Argentina than the comparatively staid version back home. And it doesn't hurt that he becomes enthralled with tango dancer Manuela (Luciana Pedraza), who consents to give him lessons.It's not that ASSASSINATION TANGO is a bad film. Nothing with Duvall can be awful. But the bilateral plot didn't click. On one hand, it was never explained why the general needed killing beyond vague references to some terrible things he'd done in the past, presumably against Argentine innocents. That wasn't enough for me to cheer on Anderson's success in the endeavor beyond a laissez-faire goodwill that I would minimally grant the protagonist of any story. On the other hand, there never seemed to be much chemistry between John and Manuela. At one point early in their relationship, Anderson asks the young woman if he'd ""have a chance"" with her if he was younger. With a coy smile, Manuela answers that he has a chance now. It's a brief spark that fails to erupt into flames.Anderson is perhaps not one you'd want buying a prepubescent girl ice cream, though his conduct with Jenny is irreproachable and devoted. There are some murky corners to his character that go unexplored, as the encounter with an Argentine prostitute. Therefore, the best reason to see this film is the wonderful dancing. Assuming you're a tango fan, that is. If you're not particularly, then you might be reduced to ogling Pedraza's gorgeous legs to get back the price of the ticket. Not bad value, that.",3,Does not quite click,1050278400,"04 14, 2003",2003,2632,"['Actor', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'apparently', 'liking', 'tango', 'dance', 'wanted', 'share', 'passion', 'world', 'film', 'However', 'perhaps', 'felt', 'something', 'needed', 'be', 'added', 'storyline', 'reach', 'wider', 'audience', 'Thus', 'writer', 'director', 'producer', 'ASSASSINATION', 'TANGO', 'added', 'plot', 'subplot', 'professional', 'killer', 'hired', 'South', 'American', 'wet', 'job.Duvall', 'John', 'Anderson', 'aging', 'hit', 'man', 'employ', 'Big', 'Apple', 'mobster', 'Frankie', 'Frank', 'Gio', 'light', 'Anderson', 'life', '10-year', 'old', 'Jenny', 'Katherine', 'Miller', 'daughter', 'significant', 'other', 'Maggie', 'Kathy', 'Baker', 'Jenny', 'birthday', 'following', 'week', 'John', 'assignment', 'Argentina', 'whack', 'retired', 'general', 'Frankie', 'job', 'should', 'only', 'take', 'three', 'days', 'quick', 'down', 'back', 'time', 'birthday', 'cake', 'presents', 'However', 'once', 'Buenos', 'Aires', 'hit', 'postponed', 'John', 'must', 'cool', 'heels', 'three', 'weeks', 'period', 'Anderson', 'anger', 'delay', 'tango', 'rather', 'tango', 'more', 'structured', 'passionately', 'choreographed', 'Argentina', 'comparatively', 'staid', 'version', 'back', 'home', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'enthralled', 'tango', 'dancer', 'Manuela', 'Luciana', 'Pedraza', 'who', 'give', 'not', 'ASSASSINATION', 'TANGO', 'bad', 'film', 'Nothing', 'Duvall', 'can', 'be', 'awful', 'bilateral', 'plot', 'did', ""n't"", 'click', 'one', 'hand', 'was', 'never', 'explained', 'why', 'general', 'needed', 'killing', 'vague', 'references', 'terrible', 'things', ""'d"", 'done', 'past', 'presumably', 'Argentine', 'innocents', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'cheer', 'Anderson', 'success', 'endeavor', 'laissez-faire', 'goodwill', 'would', 'minimally', 'grant', 'protagonist', 'story', 'other', 'hand', 'never', 'seemed', 'be', 'much', 'chemistry', 'John', 'Manuela', 'one', 'point', 'early', 'relationship', 'Anderson', 'young', 'woman', ""'d"", 'have', 'chance', 'was', 'younger', 'coy', 'smile', 'Manuela', 'chance', 'now', 'brief', 'spark', 'erupt', 'flames.Anderson', 'perhaps', 'not', 'one', ""'d"", 'want', 'buying', 'prepubescent', 'girl', 'ice', 'cream', 'conduct', 'Jenny', 'irreproachable', 'devoted', 'are', 'murky', 'corners', 'character', 'go', 'unexplored', 'encounter', 'Argentine', 'prostitute', 'Therefore', 'best', 'reason', 'see', 'film', 'wonderful', 'dancing', 'Assuming', ""'re"", 'tango', 'fan', ""'re"", 'not', 'particularly', 'then', 'might', 'be', 'reduced', 'ogling', 'Pedraza', 'gorgeous', 'legs', 'get', 'back', 'price', 'ticket', 'Not', 'bad', 'value']",N/A

The plot is more complex than that though.  Duvall's character is a complex man.  His middle-aged girlfriend back home has a 10-year-old daughter he adores and there are several domestic scenes which show this love.  He also loves to dance and is fascinated with the tango.  And so, when he is in Argentina and the assassination is delayed several weeks, he meets Luciana Pedraza, a tango dancer at least 40 years his junior.  He asks her for lessons and is swept into the world of the tango.  We see a lot of dancing and sense the discipline and timing that this special art form requires.  He's now definitely in a romantic relationship.  But whether it's with this young Argentine woman or the tango itself is difficult to differentiate.  There is also the sense of danger as the actual assassination draws near.  This is not going to be a simple job and we soon sense a double cross going on.This is not a simple film.  Robert Duvall's role is too complicated for that. It requires great subtlety in his acting to hint at all his inner conflicts.  It is clear he is suppressing emotion and we feel his inner tension throughout.  And the screenplay's references to the fact that he is aging makes it seem actually quite plausible that this 72-year-old assassin will be able to carry out his job.I tend to like fast-paced plots and so I found Assassination Tango a little too slow for my taste.  And there were several loose ends in the resolution of relationships.  But I did enjoy the complexity of the story which exists on many levels.

It also uses the sensual tango dance as a theme in itself. These elements do not always gel in this slow paced film, but I found it captivating all the same.Duvall plays John, a contract killer who is sent to Argentina to kill a prominent general. He is reluctant to go, mainly because he doesn't want to miss his stepdaughter's birthday. His attachment to this young girl, which, the film suggests, may cross the line beyond paternal affection, is one of the many aspects of this complex character. If there is any point to the film that I  could discern, it is that John is a person who lacks integration. It is Duvall's ability to portray this character that makes the film. He is moody, volatile, introspective and passionate, often in inappropriate ways. He is able to rationalize his violent profession by having the attitude that &quot;it's just a job.&quot; When he sees a beautiful tango dancer (Luciana Pedraza, who also gives a great performance), he develops a new obsession. While stalking his victim in the streets of Buenos Aires, he gets to know the dancer and their often meandering conversations are some of the best scenes in the film. During the long stretches when there is not much going on, there is still a sense of lurking menace. John is in a foreign country and doesn't know if he can trust his employers.  I actually appreciated the disjointed quality of the film, which might be a turnoff for some viewers.

I liked the movie so much that I ordered the DVD. The DVD arrived on Saturday, December 13th. It is obvious that I liked the movie.  However, the DVD exceeded my expecations.  First of all, the movie is there with picture and sound presentation.  It is, of course, available in English, Spanish, and Portuguese.  In addition, there are subtitles in English, Spanish, Portuguese, and French.In addition to the movie presentation, there is also a presentation of the movie with an audio commentary while the movie is being shown on a scene-by-scene basis by Robert Duvall and Luciana Pedraza.  They comment on who the characters (personajes) are  in the picture, the actors who played them including some facts about their lives, how the secene was shot and why the scene was shot in that manner, etc.  As you know, the whole premise of the movie was to have a movie about Tango.  The aspect of assassination and organized crime was just a way to tie an American who was not a tanguero into the action.  You already know that Robert Duvall had been in the Godfather movies and that Francis Ford Copolla was involved both with the Godfather and with Assassination Tango.  The audio commentary brings together some discussion of the mafia in New York into the development of John J.  Minor characters in the movie included Reuben Blades, a Panamanian living in Los Angeles, Julio Oscar Pedroso, a Cuban actor, and Raul Outeada who had been an Argentine boxer (the equivalent of Frankie Gio).  General Rojas, the general who was to be assassinated, was played by Elvio Nessier, an Argentine actor who has had a distinguished career in repertory theater.I was pleased to see some favorite tango people including Maria Nieves,  Melina Plebs and Ezequel Farfaro, Carlos Copello, and Pablo Veron.  I have had lessons with most of those people.  We also noted seeing Adolfo (Jerry) Alonso and his wife Joji Alonso, who tangueros from Baltimore, in a background scene in a practica.In addition to the movie and commentary, there was a presentation on the music in Assassination Tango, including the original music written by Luis Bacalov, an Argentine expatriot living in Rome.  Bacalov is best known for the music to Missa Tango, Tangosain, and the Academy Award for the music in &quot;Il Postino.&quot;I liked the movie and would recommend it not just to tangueros.

This lack of openness may have been done intentionally by writer, director and star Robert Duvall because his character, John Anderson, seems very close to the edge of madness. Anderson himself probably does not know quite what's going on in his own mind.Anderson lives a dual life in New York City. He has a live-in girlfriend [Kathy Bates]. Her ten-year daughter, which he has more or less adopted, is the great passion in his life. Both the girlfriend and the daughter adore Anderson. What neither knows is that his real job is that of an assassin for a group of New York mobsters. When his bosses approach him to do one last, well paying hit, he reluctantly agrees. Off he goes to Buenos Aires, where he play a cat-and-mouse game with the locals who hired him. Are they dealing honestly with him, or is he being set up? While he waits to find out, he meets a beautiful local girl and explores the art of The Tango with her.The point of the movie, I suppose, is that many people really do possess a dual nature. Anderson is both a lover and a killer, and he has reached the age where these conflicting roles truly collide.`Assassination Tango' is a movie for people who love movies and great acting.

As I recall, this movie did not get very wide distribution at all.  I really did not know what to expect but I must tell you that I was positively mesmerized by this film.  Recently, I picked up a copy of ""Assassination Tango"" and viewed it again for the first time in seven years.  I think I enjoyed it even more the second time around.  Robert Duvall grabbed my attention in the opening scene and simply never let go.In ""Assassination Tango"" Duvall plays hit man John J. who is an individual full of contradictions.  Despite what he chooses to do for a living John likes to think of himself as family man who positive adores his girlfriend Maggie (Kathy Baker) and most especially her 10 year old daughter Jenny (Katherine Micheaux Miller} who is the light of his life.  John J's latest assignment finds him off to Buenos Aires, Argentina for what he expects will be about a three day sojourn.  Once in Argentina he learns that he was brought there to take out an unpopular aging General. This one would be quick and easy, neat and clean.  But suddenly there were complications.  His target the General had been injured in an accident and would be confined to his bed for at least a couple of weeks.  Those who had brought him to Argentina to do the deed still wanted this done and determined that it would be very dangerous for John to leave the country and return later on. So now John has lots of time on his hands.  One evening he wanders into a nightclub quite by chance and is positively captivated by what he sees. Tango is unlike anything he has seen before.  He loves the passion and the elegance of it all.  He discovers that the tango is a highly syncopated dance with staccato steps.  The couples he observes on the floor dance it with a certain sensual, dramatic flair, in a close embrace, their faces pointed in the same direction, arms extended, hands clasped or palms together. He wants to know more and he longs to take part.Shortly thereafter he meets Manuela (Luciana Pedraza).  She is a tantalizing creature who is happy to acquaint our hero will all of the finer points of this Latin-American dance.  He develops a relationship with her while continuing to make preparations to execute the job he was sent there to do.  He keeps moving and at one point discovers that the plot has been compromised.  He is very nearly apprehended and finds himself in an extremely tight spot.  John determines that he will carry off the execution his way.  Meanwhile, he continues to see Manuela and in one of the most compelling scenes in the film he enjoys dinner with Manuela and her family.  At one point in the conversation  Manuela's aunt explains to John just what tango is.  ""Tango is life, love, hate"" she says and then goes on to give a very moving and beautiful description of what it all means.  The interplay between John's work and his developing relationship with Manuela is fascinating to watch unfold.As I recall the critics were sharply divided in their opinions of this film.  I must side with those who enjoyed it.  I found ""Assassination Tango"" to be a very well written and beautifully photographed motion picture.  I also thought the acting was superb.  If you have not seen this one I strongly urge you to check it out.

778769,AM4X3TREMZTQZ,B0000DI880,Peggy A,"[0, 0]","I fell for the hype of this movie, and purchased it, thinking it was going to be an ""intriguing"" thriller that was enhanced by the great acting talent of Robert Duvall and breathtaking scenes of the tango.  After popping the DVD into the player, I settled onto the couch to watch the story unfold.  Initially, the movie seemed to drag, although that's not all that unusual when the sub-plots of a crime thriller are being set up, and you usually find that what seems a bit boring at the beginning turns out to have quite a nice payout by the end.  But the movie never got going, and I fell asleep about 35 minutes into it.  I attempted to watch the movie three more times, but never made it to the end without falling asleep. I paid for the stupid thing, and I wanted to watch it before I put it in the ""toss"" pile, so I finally forced myself to sit through the entire movie, taking a break when my eyelids started to close.The plot was superficial, at best, and the ""whys"" of the sub-plots went unanswered. (Who was the General, what did he do, and why did he deserve to be killed?)  There simply wasn't any of the advertised intrigue.  The picture and sound weren't as crisp and sharp as they could have been, either.  The dancing sequences seemed to be the only redeeming feature of this movie.  Without them, the movie would have been one star.  This ""thriller"" seemed to be a thinly veiled attempt to write a story about a man learning how to tango.  Unfortunately, it didn't work.Spoiler Alert!I felt no sympathy for the main character; in fact, he seemed to be a lowlife creep.  He didn't have any chemistry at all with his ""girlfriend,"" making me wonder why they were together.  That feeling was reinforced by the fact that he hired a prostitute after a very short separation, AND he began an (emotional) relationship with the younger tango dancer in the movie.  Some comments during the movie, along with his fascination with young girls and the ""daddy"" role he played with the prostitute, made me think the character may have been a pedophile.  He didn't sexually abuse any children in the movie, but there were creepy undertones.",2,Sleeper - Literally,1362873600,"03 10, 2013",2013,2140,"['fell', 'hype', 'movie', 'purchased', 'thinking', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'intriguing', 'thriller', 'was', 'enhanced', 'great', 'acting', 'talent', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'breathtaking', 'scenes', 'tango', 'popping', 'DVD', 'player', 'settled', 'couch', 'watch', 'story', 'unfold', 'Initially', 'movie', 'seemed', 'drag', 'not', 'unusual', 'when', 'sub-plots', 'crime', 'thriller', 'are', 'being', 'set', 'up', 'usually', 'find', 'what', 'bit', 'boring', 'beginning', 'out', 'have', 'quite', 'nice', 'payout', 'end', 'movie', 'never', 'got', 'going', 'fell', 'asleep', '35', 'minutes', 'attempted', 'watch', 'movie', 'three', 'more', 'times', 'never', 'made', 'end', 'falling', 'asleep', 'paid', 'stupid', 'thing', 'wanted', 'watch', 'put', 'toss', 'pile', 'so', 'finally', 'forced', 'sit', 'entire', 'movie', 'taking', 'break', 'when', 'eyelids', 'started', 'close.The', 'plot', 'was', 'superficial', 'best', 'whys', 'sub-plots', 'went', 'unanswered', 'Who', 'was', 'General', 'what', 'did', 'do', 'why', 'did', 'deserve', 'be', 'killed', 'simply', 'was', ""n't"", 'advertised', 'intrigue', 'picture', 'sound', 'were', ""n't"", 'crisp', 'sharp', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'either', 'dancing', 'sequences', 'seemed', 'be', 'only', 'redeeming', 'feature', 'movie', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'star', 'thriller', 'seemed', 'be', 'thinly', 'veiled', 'attempt', 'write', 'story', 'man', 'learning', 'how', 'tango', 'Unfortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'work.Spoiler', 'Alert', 'felt', 'sympathy', 'main', 'character', 'fact', 'seemed', 'be', 'lowlife', 'creep', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'chemistry', 'girlfriend', 'making', 'wonder', 'why', 'were', 'together', 'feeling', 'was', 'reinforced', 'fact', 'hired', 'prostitute', 'very', 'short', 'separation', 'began', 'emotional', 'relationship', 'younger', 'tango', 'dancer', 'movie', 'comments', 'movie', 'fascination', 'young', 'girls', 'daddy', 'role', 'played', 'prostitute', 'made', 'think', 'character', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'pedophile', 'did', ""n't"", 'sexually', 'abuse', 'children', 'movie', 'were', 'creepy', 'undertones']",N/A

I have known people as quirky and yet functional as his character. So high marks for that. If you can just relax and enjoy the characters' interactions, slow as some scenes often are, this seems as worthwhile as some of Woody Allen's more recent serious films, for example. This and the tango scenes carried the film for me and I would rate it better if there had not been some distractions.The distraction was the plot. The film is set up as a who-done-it. There is a lot of tension and it keeps you in suspense trying to figure out what is going on. Forget it!! You are never going to figure out what exactly the double cross was. Even in the director's commentary you get the feeling that this was never important to Duvall, who is the director. So its confusing he says about a certain scene -- so what, life is like that. Okay point taken but in the end one is left wanting some clarity on the overall assassination matter.You have to conclude that the film was about a professional assassin that did not care what he was involved in (and that was clear in the film) but was prepared for some sort of double cross and did not even look back to wonder what it had been. The director felt much the same way but somehow or other was not able to make it clear to me in the film that it was that kind of film where we would never be able to figure out just what the double cross was about. So this left me feeling critical of the way the film was put together. I think it would have been possible to do a better job on this. BUT maybe the problem is that I am one of those viewers that got too involved in the who-done-it aspects of the plot. But then I think, why not? The film sets us up with a lot of suspense that implies plot aspects and not just physical threats like will the bad guys get him. I mean for example how many assassins are hired by nice middle class extended families that have the assassin to dinner and don't seem to be taking very serious precautions about secrecy? It makes you wonder what the devil is going on here?  Then when it comes to the double crosses, the film gives you enough information to seduce you into thinking you can work it out, but never actually allows you to.On the whole very watchable and many good points.

778773,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0000DI880,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 4]","In ""Assassination Tango,"" a film for which he provided both script and direction, Robert Duvall plays an aging professional killer who also happens to be a tango aficionado.  Like the gangsters in ""The Godfather,"" John J. Anderson is able to compartmentalize the morally contradictory elements of his life: he can gun down in cold blood a total stranger, while at the same time lavishing limitless love and affection on his girlfriend and the ten-year old ""stepdaughter"" whom he worships and adores.  When he is sent to Buenos Aires to take out a disreputable retired general, John falls in love with both a lovely young dancer and the style of ""genuine"" tango dancing to which she introduces him.""Assassination Tango,"" despite the unsavory elements of the story, is a quiet, muted film that is more about this strangely paradoxical character than it is about either assassination or tango.  John is a man who has kept his emotions pretty well in check his whole life and now, as he begins to see the end of that life coming, he feels the need to make some kind of meaningful connection with the people around him.  What makes John interesting is the way in which Duvall has chosen to portray him.  For the most part, John seems totally subdued in his mannerisms and tone of voice, but he often erupts unexpectedly in fits of uncontrolled mania and violence - aimed more at objects like payphones or people who annoy him than at his carefully chosen victims, whom he liquidates with an emotional detachment worthy of his profession.  Duvall hits all the right notes in making his character both frighteningly bizarre and strangely sympathetic all at the same time.As a writer, Duvall does better with dialogue than with the narrative framework as a whole.  Particularly effective is John's constantly asking the Argentineans with whom he's conversing to repeat what they have just said.  Most writer/directors would not be shrewd enough to add this calculated bit of realism, which seems just right given the bilingual situation he has set up.  Unfortunately, Duvall's considerably less successful with the story itself, which often wanders aimlessly, lacks clarity (particularly in the cloak-and-dagger sequences) and suffers from an overall failure to meld the various elements into a compelling whole.  The supporting performers are all good, but, ultimately, we are left wondering just what Duvall had in mind when he set about making this film.  If his purpose was to show that even coldhearted killers can love their kids and appreciate art and beauty, then that ground was pretty much covered by ""The Godfather"" movies.

Being an artistic endevour you really dont know whats going to happen to our protaganist, hitman in the end.I throw the word original at this work for a couple of reasons. The main character, ""John Anderson"" played by Duvall(albeit as the same cheracter we have seen him play before) is a hitman with a difference, not to much macho posturing is used creating this vulnerable,aging,and somewhat regretful professional. He's not regretful about the ""jobs"" he performed, but that as he nears the twilight of his life he has established no real roots. He does however now have girlfriend with a ten year old daughter, and his love for and devotion to this child shines through, as does Duvall's love for the Tango which is so beautifully performed many times for the loving camera by very attractive Argentinians. Both young and old.The assasination plot takes a back seat to the Tango for a good portion of the film, and when Duvall brings us back to his whole purpose of being in Argentina we are as sorry as he to have to leave this wonderful dance behind.There are one or two moments where Duvall's scenes could have been tightened up but I never felt these were very big negatives.

It is about the preoccupation with our self-image and the ability of some of us to be both ruthless and loving, amoral yet touched by innocence and art. Duvall, who wrote, starred in and directed this movie, wants to convey the transcendental power of the tango. Unfortunately, the film fails to get under the skin of its characters or its sketchy social commentary. It resonates more like a feeble soft-shoe number than an intense dance with life and death.While the examination of the world of the Tango in Argentina is interesting, especially if you love dancing, the vehicle used is a banal &quot;a hitman goes native for a while, but gets to go home again&quot; theme. The script is flawed and the movie ends with lots unresolved.The photography in both Brooklyn and Argentina contains many scenes of breathtaking beauty. Duvall's scenes with Luciana Pedraza ( Manuela) are magical ,as are the sequences involving her teaching Mr. Duvall to tango. Geraldine Rojas as Pirucha delivers a beautiful speech on the relationship of tango to life. There's a slight romance, but even though Duvall and Pedraza are real-life lovers, their onscreen chemistry is negligible, and too much of the film's thematic exploration of tango is delivered in clumsy and didactic dialogue sequences instead of blistering action on the dance floor.In the last act, it heats up as a thriller, with the usual double-crosses and hairbreadth escapes, but it's such a poor job of storytelling that through the entire finale it's impossible to figure out what is happening, who the various gangland players are, who is killing whom, and why.Recommended rental, maybe, but not something I'd really watch more than once.",3,THE PLOT FAILS TO TWIRL AS MUCH AS THE DANCING,1080864000,"04 2, 2004",2004,1789,"['Assassination', 'Tango', 'reclaiming', 'one', 'soul', 'innocence', 'wonder', 'child', 'preoccupation', 'self-image', 'ability', 'be', 'ruthless', 'loving', 'amoral', 'yet', 'touched', 'innocence', 'art', 'Duvall', 'who', 'wrote', 'starred', 'directed', 'movie', 'convey', 'transcendental', 'power', 'tango', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'get', 'skin', 'characters', 'sketchy', 'social', 'commentary', 'more', 'feeble', 'soft-shoe', 'number', 'intense', 'dance', 'life', 'death.While', 'examination', 'world', 'Tango', 'Argentina', 'interesting', 'especially', 'love', 'dancing', 'vehicle', 'used', 'banal', 'quot', 'hitman', 'native', 'while', 'go', 'home', 'again', 'quot', 'theme', 'script', 'flawed', 'movie', 'lots', 'unresolved.The', 'photography', 'Brooklyn', 'Argentina', 'many', 'scenes', 'breathtaking', 'beauty', 'Duvall', 'scenes', 'Luciana', 'Pedraza', 'Manuela', 'are', 'magical', 'are', 'sequences', 'involving', 'teaching', 'Mr.', 'Duvall', 'tango', 'Geraldine', 'Rojas', 'Pirucha', 'beautiful', 'speech', 'relationship', 'tango', 'life', 'slight', 'romance', 'even', 'Duvall', 'Pedraza', 'are', 'real-life', 'lovers', 'onscreen', 'chemistry', 'negligible', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'thematic', 'exploration', 'tango', 'delivered', 'clumsy', 'didactic', 'dialogue', 'sequences', 'instead', 'blistering', 'action', 'dance', 'floor.In', 'last', 'act', 'up', 'thriller', 'usual', 'double-crosses', 'hairbreadth', 'escapes', 'such', 'poor', 'job', 'storytelling', 'entire', 'finale', 'impossible', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'happening', 'who', 'various', 'gangland', 'players', 'are', 'who', 'killing', 'whom', 'why.Recommended', 'rental', 'maybe', 'not', 'something', ""'d"", 'really', 'watch', 'more', 'once']",N/A
