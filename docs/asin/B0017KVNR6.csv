But because I gave this dvd 4 stars instead of 5 stars was because of her nasty comment to the audience after she sang Rosie's Lullaby. The audience clapped their hands and she snapped at them as if they did not like the song. I guess she wanted then to jump for joy or something, I don't really know why she reacted that way to them. I still will continue to buy most of her cd's and dvd's however.",4,Norah pleases her audience once again,1323043200,"12 5, 2011",2011,541,"['love', 'just', 'everything', 'Norah', 'Jones', 'including', 'dvd', 'think', 'sounded', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'dvd', 'was', 'too', 'dark', 'places', 'gave', 'dvd', '4', 'stars', 'instead', '5', 'stars', 'was', 'nasty', 'comment', 'audience', 'sang', 'Rosie', 'Lullaby', 'audience', 'clapped', 'hands', 'snapped', 'did', 'not', 'song', 'guess', 'wanted', 'then', 'jump', 'joy', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'why', 'reacted', 'way', 'still', 'will', 'continue', 'buy', 'most', 'cd', 'dvd', 'however']",N/A

She has a way of capturing your attention and drawing one into her songs.

Watching Adam Levy the guitarist is always a bit painful since he's not really a solid improviser or fits in with songs that are more country bases.  I do give it to him that his improvisation skills have improved a bit.
