This is such a quaint story, apparently one in a series by the brilliant screenwriter Horton Foote, about a segment of southern American society around World War I, when parents were hyper-religious and over-protective and thought they were preserving their daughters' virtue that way.As you watch this simple theatrical drama unfold, in which the older daughter, Elizabeth, is clearly in love with Horace, a boy she grew up with and now a traveling salesman, you just want to scream at her parents that forbidding her to see him will just make her believe he's the closest thing to God.  Her father in particular is completely unreasonable about even her desire to go out with him for ice cream.A number of sub-plots unfold at the same time, including the story of a pregnant local girl who is forced into a shotgun wedding and gives birth on her wedding day to a dead baby because she wore tight corsets to hide her pregnancy, dying herself of a hemorrhage.  And there's an awful lot of spicy gossip continuously flying back and forth among these supposedly very religious and upright people.  Hypocritical is the best word to describe it.The acting and dialogue are superb--Foote employs several of his own children in this production--and you just get the feeling (and hope) that elopement is in Elizabeth's immediate future.",4,When the Presbyterians were wild and crazy--,1402272000,"06 9, 2014",2014,1399,"['dared', 'dance', 'Baptists', 'Methodists', 'such', 'quaint', 'story', 'apparently', 'one', 'series', 'brilliant', 'screenwriter', 'Horton', 'Foote', 'segment', 'southern', 'American', 'society', 'World', 'War', 'when', 'parents', 'were', 'hyper-religious', 'over-protective', 'thought', 'were', 'preserving', 'daughters', 'virtue', 'way.As', 'watch', 'simple', 'theatrical', 'drama', 'unfold', 'older', 'daughter', 'Elizabeth', 'clearly', 'love', 'Horace', 'boy', 'grew', 'up', 'now', 'traveling', 'salesman', 'just', 'want', 'scream', 'parents', 'forbidding', 'see', 'will', 'just', 'make', 'believe', 'closest', 'thing', 'God', 'father', 'particular', 'completely', 'unreasonable', 'even', 'desire', 'go', 'out', 'ice', 'cream.A', 'number', 'sub-plots', 'unfold', 'same', 'time', 'including', 'story', 'pregnant', 'local', 'girl', 'who', 'forced', 'shotgun', 'wedding', 'birth', 'wedding', 'day', 'dead', 'baby', 'wore', 'tight', 'corsets', 'hide', 'pregnancy', 'dying', 'hemorrhage', 'awful', 'lot', 'spicy', 'gossip', 'continuously', 'flying', 'back', 'forth', 'supposedly', 'very', 'religious', 'upright', 'people', 'Hypocritical', 'best', 'word', 'describe', 'it.The', 'acting', 'dialogue', 'are', 'superb', 'Foote', 'several', 'own', 'children', 'production', 'just', 'get', 'feeling', 'hope', 'elopement', 'Elizabeth', 'immediate', 'future']",Courtship

During the course of this wonderful play by Horton Foote, we get a glimpse of a solid middle class family in a small Texas town. The year is 1915 and Victorian mores rule as a patriarchal father attempts to rein in the emotional yearnings of his daughter, who has fallen in love with a young man he does not approve of. Ever polite and respectful, her face a mask of composure, she reveals in long conversations with her sister and the young man courting her the inclinations of her heart and the uncertainty she experiences in judging whether the heart should guide one's most important choices and actions. Meanwhile, dance music floats in on the evening air, belying the turmoil of small-town melodrama that swirls around them in gossip about others, past and present, for whom affairs of the heart have gone awry or fully wrong.Foote's play has been brought lovingly and faithfully to the screen. The long dialogues and monologues are magical in how they reflect the inner conflicts, the emotional negotiations made and unmade, and especially the graceful awkwardness of the two young lovers as they gently reveal their affection for each other on the front porch of her house, very much aware of the displeased father who roams the rooms inside. Like Foote's other plays, this one is for lovers of the spoken word and the theatre. I certainly loved every minute of it.",5,Wonderful . . .,1214352000,"06 25, 2008",2008,1471,"['events', 'one', 'summer', 'evening', 'young', 'woman', 'decision', 'will', 'change', 'life', 'course', 'wonderful', 'play', 'Horton', 'Foote', 'get', 'glimpse', 'solid', 'middle', 'class', 'family', 'small', 'Texas', 'town', 'year', '1915', 'Victorian', 'mores', 'rule', 'patriarchal', 'father', 'attempts', 'rein', 'emotional', 'yearnings', 'daughter', 'who', 'fallen', 'love', 'young', 'man', 'not', 'approve', 'Ever', 'polite', 'respectful', 'face', 'mask', 'composure', 'long', 'conversations', 'sister', 'young', 'man', 'courting', 'inclinations', 'heart', 'uncertainty', 'judging', 'heart', 'should', 'guide', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'choices', 'actions', 'Meanwhile', 'dance', 'music', 'floats', 'evening', 'air', 'belying', 'turmoil', 'small-town', 'melodrama', 'swirls', 'gossip', 'others', 'past', 'present', 'whom', 'affairs', 'heart', 'have', 'gone', 'awry', 'fully', 'wrong.Foote', 'play', 'been', 'brought', 'lovingly', 'faithfully', 'screen', 'long', 'dialogues', 'monologues', 'are', 'magical', 'how', 'reflect', 'inner', 'conflicts', 'emotional', 'negotiations', 'made', 'unmade', 'especially', 'graceful', 'awkwardness', 'two', 'young', 'lovers', 'gently', 'reveal', 'affection', 'other', 'front', 'porch', 'house', 'very', 'much', 'aware', 'displeased', 'father', 'who', 'rooms', 'Foote', 'other', 'plays', 'one', 'lovers', 'spoken', 'word', 'theatre', 'certainly', 'loved', 'minute']",Courtship
