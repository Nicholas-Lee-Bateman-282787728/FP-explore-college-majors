1345644,A2IWPUK181NIA,B003H6KRMK,"Cody Shay ""Big Yami No Matsuei Fan..""","[1, 2]","I had heard for some time how funny this show was and I was looking forward to seeing it.  So I finally got it this past Christmas and I have to say that I'm glad it wasn't my money that got spent.First of all, the show just isn't funny, especially in English.  The humor tries way too hard and generally just falls flat.  The English dub is barely average at best and drains what little comedy there is out of it.  While there are some decent performances, the weakness of Todd Haberkorn's portrayal of the lead male character is a major flaw.  He is unemotional, flat, and his voice in the role is just irritating to me.  I was disappointed as I've generally been a fan of most of Todd's performances, but this is undoubtedly his weakest to date.  Sadly this is yet another Funimation dub that could have been quite good if they had just put a bit more time and consideration into casting a lead character instead of just picking some hot in house actor, seemingly by throwing at a dart board.  It's doubly shameful as the script is actually pretty strong, at least with the material they had to work with.On the bright side, the video quality is respectable, particularly for an anime release that has 6+ episodes per disc.  There are some compression artifacts, but they are not to the degree that has been seen in other Funi releases such as Ghost Hunt, Fruits Basket and others.  Their video quality for their collections took sometime to improve but it appears to finally be on the same level as Sentai, Media Blasters and others.Also, while the dub is weak and the show is overall rather unfunny, I did find the Japanese language version slightly more enjoyable.  The voices suit their characters much more closely and there is some true emotion in their performances.  If you're going to watch it, I would recommend the Japanese track (and this is coming from a HUGE dub fan.)All in all, it's a relatively solid release of a fairly bland property with a lackluster dub.  I doubt that even with a better dub that the show would have been much better.  It's not terrible.  It's not even really bad.  It's just remarkably average and unfunny.  I would only recommend this on clearance.",3,"I Expected Funny, I Got Meh...",1330214400,"02 26, 2012",2012,2191,"['had', 'heard', 'time', 'how', 'funny', 'show', 'was', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'So', 'finally', 'got', 'past', 'Christmas', 'have', 'say', ""'m"", 'glad', 'was', ""n't"", 'money', 'got', 'spent.First', 'show', 'just', ""n't"", 'funny', 'especially', 'English', 'humor', 'way', 'too', 'hard', 'generally', 'just', 'flat', 'English', 'dub', 'barely', 'average', 'best', 'what', 'little', 'comedy', 'are', 'decent', 'performances', 'weakness', 'Todd', 'Haberkorn', 'portrayal', 'lead', 'male', 'character', 'major', 'flaw', 'unemotional', 'flat', 'voice', 'role', 'just', 'irritating', 'was', 'disappointed', ""'ve"", 'generally', 'been', 'fan', 'most', 'Todd', 'performances', 'undoubtedly', 'weakest', 'date', 'Sadly', 'yet', 'Funimation', 'dub', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'good', 'had', 'just', 'put', 'bit', 'more', 'time', 'consideration', 'casting', 'lead', 'character', 'instead', 'just', 'picking', 'hot', 'house', 'actor', 'seemingly', 'throwing', 'dart', 'board', 'doubly', 'shameful', 'script', 'actually', 'pretty', 'strong', 'least', 'material', 'had', 'work', 'bright', 'side', 'video', 'quality', 'respectable', 'particularly', 'anime', 'release', '6+', 'episodes', 'disc', 'are', 'compression', 'artifacts', 'are', 'not', 'degree', 'been', 'seen', 'other', 'Funi', 'releases', 'such', 'Ghost', 'Hunt', 'Fruits', 'Basket', 'others', 'video', 'quality', 'collections', 'took', 'sometime', 'improve', 'finally', 'be', 'same', 'level', 'Sentai', 'Media', 'Blasters', 'others.Also', 'dub', 'weak', 'show', 'overall', 'rather', 'unfunny', 'did', 'find', 'Japanese', 'language', 'version', 'slightly', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'voices', 'suit', 'characters', 'much', 'more', 'closely', 'true', 'emotion', 'performances', ""'re"", 'going', 'watch', 'would', 'recommend', 'Japanese', 'track', 'coming', 'HUGE', 'dub', 'fan', 'relatively', 'solid', 'release', 'fairly', 'bland', 'property', 'lackluster', 'dub', 'doubt', 'even', 'better', 'dub', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'not', 'terrible', 'not', 'even', 'really', 'bad', 'just', 'remarkably', 'average', 'unfunny', 'would', 'only', 'recommend', 'clearance']","My Bride Is a Mermaid: Season 1, Part One"

Sun goes to live with Nagasumi and his family, unfortunately her father and his lackeys tag along to keep an eye on her. This anime is a lot of fun. There are lots of school hijinks, love rivals and sticky situations. There is a lot to like about this story. Lots of random wackiness and tender loving moments. There are a lot of cliches but the story is still different enough to be quite enjoyable. All of the characters are really likable, and the laughs never stop.

The humor of the series as you see a young man who after being saved by a young mermaid has two choice handed to him by the mermaid's Yakuza father marriage or death,  and of course not desiring to die he chooses the marriage part of the choice though by not making his future father-in-law happy with that desicion and now must not only survive said father-in-laws anger but also various rivals of his fiancee as well as other obstacles as well.  The series scenes throughout the series reach near heights of humor with the scenes but sometimes overdoes it as well so it's a little mix sometimes with those parts of the series.  The animation and soundtrack are very good though and the voice cast for the Japanese and English actors/actresses were done very well too,  the  extras as pretty much expected are just the usual trailers and textless intro/ending songs so not much on that end.  So is it a must have for anime fan?,  is you like outrageous hilarity scenes with lots of hijinx with a touch of romance than a positive yes but I do suggest watching a few episodes online just in case though as while the series is enjoyable again it does reach some heights where the humor isn't so much as funny as it's just plain annoying to watch...",4,Enjoyable But Also Sometimes Annoying As Well,1293494400,"12 28, 2010",2010,1410,"['series', 'whole', 'was', 'entertaining', 'satire', 'would', 'reach', 'obnoxious', 'levels', 'where', 'was', ""n't"", 'truly', 'funny', 'became', 'more', 'annoying', 'watch', 'sometimes', 'humor', 'series', 'see', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'being', 'saved', 'young', 'mermaid', 'two', 'choice', 'handed', 'mermaid', 'Yakuza', 'father', 'marriage', 'death', 'course', 'not', 'desiring', 'die', 'marriage', 'part', 'choice', 'not', 'making', 'future', 'father-in-law', 'happy', 'desicion', 'now', 'must', 'not', 'only', 'survive', 'said', 'father-in-laws', 'anger', 'also', 'various', 'rivals', 'fiancee', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'obstacles', 'well', 'series', 'scenes', 'series', 'reach', 'heights', 'humor', 'scenes', 'sometimes', 'as', 'well', 'little', 'mix', 'sometimes', 'parts', 'series', 'animation', 'soundtrack', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'though', 'voice', 'cast', 'Japanese', 'English', 'actors/actresses', 'were', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'too', 'extras', 'pretty', 'much', 'expected', 'are', 'just', 'usual', 'trailers', 'textless', 'intro/ending', 'songs', 'so', 'not', 'much', 'end', 'must', 'have', 'anime', 'fan', 'outrageous', 'hilarity', 'scenes', 'lots', 'hijinx', 'touch', 'romance', 'positive', 'yes', 'do', 'suggest', 'watching', 'few', 'episodes', 'online', 'just', 'case', 'series', 'enjoyable', 'again', 'reach', 'heights', 'where', 'humor', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'funny', 'just', 'plain', 'annoying', 'watch']","My Bride Is a Mermaid: Season 1, Part One"

1345649,AHOE04CZE9BZT,B003H6KRMK,"V. Edwards ""V. E""","[0, 0]","Okay, yes. It IS yet another harem anime with an underdog junior high student having a main love interest, along with other girls who want him as well. Only this time, a beautiful mermaid is the star. This series doesn't really focus on the other unrequited love interests, but mainly on the comedy. It's a Romantic Comedy with emphasis on ""comedy"". The gags are pretty ""up front and in your face"" as well quite rampant and frequent. So don't expect very much ""relief"" in between. Most of the characters are wild and nonsensical which fit right in with this anime. As far as nudity and other things like that go, there's more adult jokes and language than anything else. Nudity is very minimal (the exception being two episodes). Don't be alarmed for needless underwear shots, topless women, etc being in every scene.The story is, Nagasumi gets saved from drowning by a mermaid named Sun Seto. The problem? Humans are never supposed to see merfolks' true form. The human or the mermaid/merman will be killed as a result. To avoid this, Nagasumi agrees to marry Sun out of pure fear for his life and wanting to spare hers. Here is where the madness/romance begins. Sun is very dutiful and loyal while Nagasumi is trying to stay alive. Literally, as the majority of Sun's protectors and her father don't support the union. As the show progresses, you'll get introduced to the main supporting characters and rivals (some violent, some not).Overall, I enjoyed this anime. There wasn't a ridiculous amount of nudity (I was expecting it, but I was happily wrong), I was very satisfied with the ending, and I love to see character development which the main characters have. (Most of them anyway)It's basically a cute story of budding love in the midst of madness and mayhem. My only complaints are:some of the characters are annoying, some of the gags get old fast, some of the episodes seemed out of place/pointless and there's no second season coming at all. (The manga runs for FAR longer than the anime. I guess there wasn't enough money to complete the anime. :/)",4,Hijinks Under and Above the Sea,1357171200,"01 3, 2013",2013,2062,"['Okay', 'yes', 'yet', 'harem', 'anime', 'underdog', 'junior', 'high', 'student', 'having', 'main', 'love', 'interest', 'other', 'girls', 'who', 'want', 'as', 'well', 'Only', 'time', 'beautiful', 'mermaid', 'star', 'series', ""n't"", 'really', 'focus', 'other', 'unrequited', 'love', 'interests', 'mainly', 'comedy', 'Romantic', 'Comedy', 'emphasis', 'comedy', 'gags', 'are', 'pretty', 'up', 'front', 'face', 'as', 'well', 'quite', 'rampant', 'frequent', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'very', 'much', 'relief', 'Most', 'characters', 'are', 'wild', 'nonsensical', 'fit', 'right', 'anime', 'As', 'far', 'nudity', 'other', 'things', 'go', 'more', 'adult', 'jokes', 'language', 'anything', 'else', 'Nudity', 'very', 'minimal', 'exception', 'being', 'two', 'episodes', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'alarmed', 'needless', 'underwear', 'shots', 'topless', 'women', 'etc', 'being', 'scene.The', 'story', 'Nagasumi', 'saved', 'drowning', 'mermaid', 'named', 'Sun', 'Seto', 'problem', 'Humans', 'are', 'never', 'supposed', 'see', 'merfolks', 'true', 'form', 'human', 'mermaid/merman', 'will', 'be', 'killed', 'result', 'avoid', 'Nagasumi', 'marry', 'Sun', 'pure', 'fear', 'life', 'wanting', 'spare', 'hers', 'Here', 'where', 'madness/romance', 'Sun', 'very', 'dutiful', 'loyal', 'Nagasumi', 'trying', 'stay', 'alive', 'Literally', 'majority', 'Sun', 'protectors', 'father', 'do', ""n't"", 'support', 'union', 'show', ""'ll"", 'get', 'introduced', 'main', 'supporting', 'characters', 'rivals', 'violent', 'not', '.Overall', 'enjoyed', 'anime', 'was', ""n't"", 'ridiculous', 'amount', 'nudity', 'was', 'expecting', 'was', 'happily', 'wrong', 'was', 'very', 'satisfied', 'ending', 'love', 'see', 'character', 'development', 'main', 'characters', 'have', 'Most', 'anyway', 'basically', 'cute', 'story', 'budding', 'love', 'midst', 'madness', 'mayhem', 'only', 'complaints', 'are', 'characters', 'are', 'annoying', 'gags', 'get', 'old', 'fast', 'episodes', 'seemed', 'place/pointless', 'second', 'season', 'coming', 'manga', 'FAR', 'longer', 'anime', 'guess', 'there', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'money', 'complete', 'anime', '/']","My Bride Is a Mermaid: Season 1, Part One"
1345650,A2B8GXSCB1R05T,B003H6KRMK,Zack Davisson,"[7, 9]","If Jr. High School student Nagasumi Michishio watched as much anime as I do, it should have come as no surprise to him that a seemingly harmless family vacation to the Seto Inland Sea would result in an engagement to a beautiful, sweet girl whose family is made up of the local yakuza clan all of which who happen to be merfolk.  I mean, this kind of stuff happens all the time, right?So yeah, ""My Bride is a Mermaid"" (Japanese title ""Seto no Hanayome"" or ""The Bride of Seto"") is one of those kinds of anime.  But that doesn't mean it isn't good.  When working in an established genre, it is really a question of how good they do the genre, and this series does a great job.The Magical Girl/Harem combo can be done for romance (Ah! My Goddessor an overdose of fan service (Eiken) or for straight-out comedy which is what ""My Bride is a Mermaid"" goes for.  Based on the manga of the same name by Tahiko Kimura., this series is almost a parody of the genre and delivers some good laughs with the many bizarre situations Nagasumi finds himself in.  The undersea humor reminded me a lot ofOne Piecemore than anything else, with the romantic element thrown in.  ""My Bride is a Mermaid"" is pretty much a fan service -free anime, with maybe just the slightest hint of it here or there if you squint your eyes, but that is about it.The story is basic:  Nagasumi and his family go for vacation to the Seto Inland Sea, where Nagasumi almost drowns and finds himself rescued by a beautiful mermaid.  No one believes his story until that same mermaid, named Seto and with legs this time, shows up at his doorstep and begs for Nagasumi to accept her as his fianc&eacute;.  The merfolk have a code, it seems, of killing any human that sees them in their nautical form, and the only way around it is for Nagasumi to take Seto as his bride.  Marry the beautiful girl or be killed.  Of course, to complicate matters Seto's family is also the local yakuza clan, and Seto's father would much rather see Nagasumi dead than give away his precious daughter.Nagasumi and Seto are only engaged, not married, so they spend time going on dates and Seto eventually returns with Nagasumi to his hometown of Saitama to attend school with him and get to know him in preparation for their future.  Seto's family isn't going to let her go off alone, however, and they soon show up to wreck havoc on Nagasumi's school life.  Of course, there are some human girls back at school that fancy Nagasumi as well, and a rival mermaid shows up to give Seto a battle for Nagasumi, who she wants to take as her manservant.  Hijinks ensue.There is all sorts of good comedy packed into this series.  Seto has legs only so long as her feet don't get wet, which means that water is flying everywhere during the series.  Seto's bodyguard Maki is a tiny little elf-girl that lives in a spiral shell but comes out sword a swinging every time she thinks Nagasumi is over-stepping his bounds.  The series relies a lot on running gags and playing around with the genre tropes, such as Nagasumi getting his ""first kiss"" stolen by male yakuza member Masa so Nagasumi is rendered as a ""bishonen"" -type whenever Masa shows up.  When Seto gets serious, she is suddenly shrouded in darkness and accompanied by falling cherry blossoms, which leads the other characters to wonder where all the blossoms are coming from.  There are two transformed-animal yakuza members, Shark Fujishiro and Octopus Nakajima who are exactly what their names sound like.The only complaint I have with ""My Bride is a Mermaid"" is with the subtitles.  Japanese is a language with many regional dialects, and too often translators feel compelled to use various English accents or way of speaking to capture this.  It doesn't work.  Even though Sun and her family speak perfectly polite Japanese using the dialect local to Seto, the subtitles have them speaking like a bunch of hillbillies saying things like ""yer gonna get it"" or other ridiculous phrases.  When Sun says ""Watashi was Nagasumi no tsuma ni naru"" the subtitles says ""I'm yer future wife"" which is not at all correct.  She doesn't speak like an uneducated country bumbkin.  I don't mind it if this kind of translations is used when done for effect, like when the tiny Maki talks in her ""yakuza voice"" when trying to be intimidating but then switches back to normal Japanese, but putting those words in Sun's mouth all the time just doesn't work.This release by Funimation has the first 13 episodes of the 26-episode series originally released in 2007.  The series is continued inMy Bride Is a Mermaid: Season One, Part Two.  Although the boxsets say ""Season One,"" there actually is no ""Season Two"" following up this anime There were two OVA releases in 2008 and 2009, although I don't know if there are plans to release these as well, but it is possible they would be released as a limited ""Season Two,"" but they would be very short and non-continuous.",4,The Bride of Seto,1279152000,"07 15, 2010",2010,4931,"['Jr.',
