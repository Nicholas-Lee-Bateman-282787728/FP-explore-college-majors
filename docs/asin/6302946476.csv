347172,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,6302946476,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 2]","BACHELOR IN PARADISE (1962, 111 minutes) is a strange film, half comedy, half life-study. It is also simply not that funny. Bob Hope, such a genius as recently as in THE IRON PETTICOAT (1956), is used here as a cardboard cutout figure, frequently at the center of silly gags while cracking almost no jokes.The story is brief: Hope plays a lecherous author who has published over a dozen books about how to seduce women in various countries. The books are typical of the 1960s trash I recall, posing as books of scholarly merit while being nothing but goofy, smutty tales.After some legal hassles and losing his fortune, Hope is sent into a ""tract housing"" development to cool his heels. His publisher/agent is also looking for Hope to write a book based on the American woman's needs. He finds himself hip-deep in southern California tract neighborhood intrigue - and staring down the throat of Lana Turner.Well, this tired old thing is so tedious that I often just switch it off, wondering why I ever even bother to watch it. Mainly I like the cars (WAY too few) and seeing the California neighborhoods, with which I am familiar, when they were first being built. It also reminds me of the deep impact these kinds of stupid films had on stupid TV sitcoms in the late 1960s and especially in the 1970s.What you won't get here is any kind of warmth or real humor from Hope, who had taken to grumpy, totally non-humorous roles around this time.

347174,A1P7R1Z7BQ5HCL,6302946476,Ian Hunter,"[1, 2]","Here is a case of another surprise sprung on an unsuspecting viewer of TCM-Africa. A writer (Bob Hope) is trapped into writing a book on How American's Live, to pay back-taxes. He is transported from the East Coast to the West; to be integrated in Paradise (Village, in the San Fernando Valley of California). It is a modern planned community, where everything is in its place, including the parents and two children in each household, the husbands' daily commute and the wives' tending home as is their place in life, according to that time (the early 1960s, when men were still wearing hats). It had all the hallmarks of a suburban idyll (not Radburn or the principles enshrined in Alexander's Community and Privacy - for dedicated town planners), captured in the roles defined by convention. The counterpart to a very funny Bob Hope (with some terrific `one-liners') is a stunning and very surprising Lana Turner. The comedy proceeds apace as he awakens the wives to the notion that they should expect more in marriage and indeed, in life. While the film is a gentle comedy (which reveals the early comedic potential of Paula Prentice), it has a serious point to make, certainly on archaic thinking about women but maybe even, on suburbia itself!Ian Hunter.Author of `e-Love'.",4,A gentle comedy with a serious point,1315094400,"09 4, 2011",2011,1279,"['Here', 'case', 'surprise', 'sprung', 'unsuspecting', 'viewer', 'TCM-Africa', 'A', 'writer', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'trapped', 'writing', 'book', 'How', 'American', 'Live', 'pay', 'back-taxes', 'transported', 'East', 'Coast', 'West', 'be', 'integrated', 'Paradise', 'Village', 'San', 'Fernando', 'Valley', 'California', 'modern', 'planned', 'community', 'where', 'everything', 'place', 'including', 'parents', 'two', 'children', 'household', 'husbands', 'daily', 'commute', 'wives', 'tending', 'home', 'place', 'life', 'according', 'time', 'early', '1960s', 'when', 'men', 'were', 'still', 'wearing', 'hats', 'had', 'hallmarks', 'suburban', 'idyll', 'not', 'Radburn', 'principles', 'enshrined', 'Alexander', 'Community', 'Privacy', 'dedicated', 'town', 'planners', 'captured', 'roles', 'defined', 'convention', 'counterpart', 'very', 'funny', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'terrific', 'one-liners', 'stunning', 'very', 'surprising', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'comedy', 'proceeds', 'apace', 'wives', 'notion', 'should', 'expect', 'more', 'marriage', 'indeed', 'life', 'film', 'gentle', 'comedy', 'early', 'comedic', 'potential', 'Paula', 'Prentice', 'serious', 'point', 'make', 'certainly', 'archaic', 'thinking', 'women', 'maybe', 'even', 'suburbia', 'Ian', 'Hunter.Author', 'e-Love']",N/A
