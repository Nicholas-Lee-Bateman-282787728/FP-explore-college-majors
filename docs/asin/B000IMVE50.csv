I love these Shriek Show sets and have at least 6 or 7 of them, and this is the only one I really found dull or boring.

1021415,AZXHK8IO25FL6,B000IMVE50,ribcage,"[9, 10]","The Shriek Show packs are always a great deal and this one is no exception. The three films included (Black Demons, Demons 3: The Ogre, The Other Hell) are all okay, not great, films on their own, but here you get them together, and at a cheaper price than getting any one of them on their own. Also, each is the same DVD that is sold individually, so its not like those deals at Walmart where you get a free dvd at the cost of getting fullframe or rated instead of unrated or whatever the case may be. Each one is the same all around package as you'd be getting on its own, so if you're looking for any one of the three in here, this is the obvious choice.As for the films themselves we have Black Demons which follows some tourists in South America who stir up the vengeful dead upon an estate in the jungle. Some okay gore and an overall creepy feeling. A little convulted like most of these Italian films, but if you've seen more than a couple of them along the same lines, it's nothing you can't handle.Next up, we have Demons 3: The Ogre. It's a franchise title stealer, so don't come expecting the likes of Demons or Demons 2. We have the story of a horror writer who heads out to a castle and begins to feel that she is being stalked through the castle by a monster that haunted in her youth and has been the inspiration for all her writings. It's an alright film, but really drawn out and with a ridiculous, uncertain ending. Still, the tension between the woman and her husband, who doesn't understand her paranoia in the least, is interesting to watch.Finally, there is THE OTHER HELL, a story about nuns gone wild. But not naked. Not a lot of gore here. Or story. Or acting. Good to watch once if you're into this sort of thing(and if you're looking at this pack you should be) so whatever. I was cool with the other two films, and this one wasn't BOTTOM of the barrel(mostly because it wasn't shot on like three cameras with two lights) so okay.It's a good set. Two decent movies, and one movie worth a looking at anyway, all for less than the price of any one of these movies on their own.",5,great deal like all the other shriek show packs,1220227200,"09 1, 2008",2008,2103,"['Shriek', 'Show', 'packs', 'are', 'always', 'great', 'deal', 'one', 'exception', 'three', 'films', 'included', 'Black', 'Demons', 'Demons', '3', 'Ogre', 'Other', 'Hell', 'are', 'okay', 'not', 'great', 'films', 'own', 'here', 'get', 'together', 'cheaper', 'price', 'getting', 'one', 'own', 'Also', 'same', 'DVD', 'sold', 'individually', 'not', 'deals', 'Walmart', 'where', 'get', 'free', 'dvd', 'cost', 'getting', 'fullframe', 'rated', 'instead', 'unrated', 'case', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'same', 'around', 'package', ""'d"", 'be', 'getting', 'own', 'so', ""'re"", 'looking', 'one', 'three', 'here', 'obvious', 'choice.As', 'films', 'have', 'Black', 'Demons', 'tourists', 'South', 'America', 'who', 'stir', 'up', 'vengeful', 'dead', 'estate', 'jungle', 'okay', 'gore', 'overall', 'creepy', 'feeling', 'little', 'convulted', 'most', 'Italian', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'more', 'couple', 'same', 'lines', 'nothing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle.Next', 'up', 'have', 'Demons', '3', 'Ogre', 'franchise', 'title', 'stealer', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'expecting', 'likes', 'Demons', 'Demons', '2', 'have', 'story', 'horror', 'writer', 'who', 'out', 'castle', 'feel', 'being', 'stalked', 'castle', 'monster', 'haunted', 'youth', 'been', 'inspiration', 'writings', 'alright', 'film', 'really', 'drawn', 'out', 'ridiculous', 'uncertain', 'ending', 'Still', 'tension', 'woman', 'husband', 'who', ""n't"", 'understand', 'paranoia', 'least', 'interesting', 'watch.Finally', 'OTHER', 'HELL', 'story', 'nuns', 'gone', 'wild', 'not', 'naked', 'Not', 'lot', 'gore', 'here', 'story', 'acting', 'Good', 'watch', 'once', ""'re"", 'sort', 'thing', ""'re"", 'looking', 'pack', 'should', 'be', 'so', 'whatever', 'was', 'cool', 'other', 'two', 'films', 'one', 'was', ""n't"", 'BOTTOM', 'barrel', 'mostly', 'was', ""n't"", 'shot', 'three', 'cameras', 'two', 'lights', 'so', 'good', 'set', 'Two', 'decent', 'movies', 'one', 'movie', 'looking', 'anyway', 'less', 'price', 'one', 'movies', 'own']",Demons Triple Feature: The Other Hell/Demons III: The Ogre/Black Demons
1021416,ASFQ52Z8QOVSA,B000IMVE50,Ronnie,"[1, 1]","The best movie out of this triple feature box set is BLACK DEMONS (aka Demoni 3). The other two are OK. I'd have to say that THE OTHER HELL is better than DEMONS III (The Ogre). One fault is that during one scene in THE OGRE the picture blacks out while the sound is still heard. It seems like a glitch in the pressing of the DVD. It is very noticeable! I had to go back to the scene to make sure it wasn't my player. It wasn't! It is a DVD glitch for sure! So far that is the only imperfection I found. Apart fom that, this is a collection I highly recommend.
