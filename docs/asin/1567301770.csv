184850,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,1567301770,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","There are some films that are so disturbing in nature that they make you somewhat physically sick to watch.  `The War Zone' is one of those films.  It just lays it all out there in a way that can truly disturb and repel the audience, but it is shockingly done in such a way that you cannot help but be drawn in.  First time director Tim Roth understands how to create an organic feeling from the ground up, giving us a family that feels human and complete despite their questionable practices.Basically, this is a film of unrelenting incest and the effect it has on a family.  We follow adolescent Tom as he uncovers his sister Jessie and their father having sex and his world is completely turned upside down as he attempts to root it all out and find answers to the reason behind it all.  There is no real reason given, and it isn't until the very end that the audience is truly let in to understand Jessie's feelings on the whole matter, but the fact that it takes place and that their father is a monster is never up for debate, despite the `everyman' vibe that is initially attributed to him.  With a newborn baby in the house, danger lurks in the air as Tom starts to question everything he thinks he knows, and when it all comes crashing down in the final act the viewer is left with this knot in their stomach that will not go away.And the implications of the final frame are truly unsettling.The film feels dirty, grungy and grimy and I think that was an intentional directorial decision.  The frames themselves have a gritty look to them, and the constant barrage of flesh (this family has no modesty) and the lack of makeup (everyone looks human, scars and all) and this can get under the viewer's skin.  Also, the actual scene of abuse is jarring and hard to watch.  It was actually noted that the scene was near impossible to shoot, with camera men crying and Ray Winstone threatening to leave the project entirely.  Still, it never feels exploitive or shocking for shocking sake.  It actually feels necessary and tasteful, considering the subject.Winstone is astonishingly good as `dear ol' dad' and does a remarkable job of shading his every intention.  Lara Belmont is also fantastic here, juggling a very complex role and giving her a true identity.This is not a film everyone will be able to stomach, but it is a film that packs a serious punch and shows considerable depth of filmmaking.",4,Casualties of war...,1347321600,"09 11, 2012",2012,2406,"['are', 'films', 'are', 'so', 'disturbing', 'nature', 'make', 'somewhat', 'physically', 'sick', 'watch', 'War', 'Zone', 'one', 'films', 'just', 'out', 'there', 'way', 'can', 'truly', 'disturb', 'repel', 'audience', 'shockingly', 'done', 'such', 'way', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'be', 'drawn', 'First', 'time', 'director', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'how', 'create', 'organic', 'feeling', 'ground', 'up', 'giving', 'family', 'human', 'complete', 'questionable', 'practices.Basically', 'film', 'unrelenting', 'incest', 'effect', 'family', 'follow', 'adolescent', 'Tom', 'sister', 'Jessie', 'father', 'having', 'sex', 'world', 'completely', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'root', 'out', 'find', 'answers', 'reason', 'real', 'reason', 'given', ""n't"", 'very', 'end', 'audience', 'truly', 'let', 'understand', 'Jessie', 'feelings', 'whole', 'matter', 'fact', 'place', 'father', 'monster', 'never', 'up', 'debate', 'everyman', 'vibe', 'initially', 'attributed', 'newborn', 'baby', 'house', 'danger', 'lurks', 'air', 'Tom', 'question', 'everything', 'when', 'crashing', 'down', 'final', 'act', 'viewer', 'left', 'knot', 'stomach', 'will', 'not', 'go', 'implications', 'final', 'frame', 'are', 'truly', 'unsettling.The', 'film', 'feels', 'dirty', 'grungy', 'grimy', 'think', 'was', 'intentional', 'directorial', 'decision', 'frames', 'have', 'gritty', 'look', 'constant', 'barrage', 'flesh', 'family', 'modesty', 'lack', 'makeup', 'everyone', 'human', 'scars', 'can', 'get', 'viewer', 'skin', 'Also', 'actual', 'scene', 'abuse', 'jarring', 'hard', 'watch', 'was', 'actually', 'noted', 'scene', 'was', 'near', 'impossible', 'shoot', 'camera', 'men', 'crying', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'threatening', 'leave', 'project', 'entirely', 'Still', 'never', 'exploitive', 'shocking', 'shocking', 'sake', 'actually', 'necessary', 'tasteful', 'considering', 'subject.Winstone', 'astonishingly', 'good', 'dear', 'ol', 'dad', 'remarkable', 'job', 'shading', 'intention', 'Lara', 'Belmont', 'also', 'fantastic', 'here', 'juggling', 'very', 'complex', 'role', 'giving', 'true', 'identity.This', 'not', 'film', 'everyone', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'stomach', 'film', 'serious', 'punch', 'considerable', 'depth', 'filmmaking']",N/A

I saw this film on a last second idea and had no idea what I was getting into. I  thought since Tim Roth directed it considering his acting material that it  would be some kind of gangster or crime noir film and then from the opening  I thought it may be a &quot;Nill By Mouth&quot; kind of film. This film  surprised me in all ways. The film unleashes a dark family secret. The film  potraits this secret like its a ritual more than a sensation. The father is  potrait as more realstic than one would exepect him to be. The acting is  powerful and always supports the subject content. The film was shot in  Devon which I've been to and it is a beautiful town. I am just stunned that  Tim Roth did this. He goes beyond and does something that you would never  think he would do.

184855,A2U22M4AXDZDYU,1567301770,Dan Balogh,"[25, 27]","When Interiors was released years ago, Woody Allen fans were surprisingly introduced (for better or worse) to a dimension of the comic film-maker that they never knew existed. The arrival of this film has certainly surprised many in regards to its maker Tim Roth -- here we see a side of Pumpkin and Mr. Orange (Roth's breakthrough roles in his two Tarantino films) that we may have seen hints of, but which never prepared us for something like this. Not only does Roth demonstrate an eagerness to be involved with very dark, very serious Bergman-esque melodrama, but in doing so he demonstrates unequivocally his facility in being the directing hand behind it all.It's the depressing, dreary story of a family ripped apart by incest, emotionally draining, and not for all tastes. Roth, in his very impressive directorial debut, creates an atmosphere of unbearable hopelessness -- using isolated rocky locations, soaked in rain, wind and cold, and photographed in muted blues and grays, Roth's film canvas resembles something from Picasso's blue period with the amazingly sad face of Lara Belmont (as the abused daughter) echoing the gaunt, pale harlequins of that master's works. It's also remiscient of Ingmar Bergman, in story and in texture (have another look at Persona and you'll swear the two films were shot on the same beaches). By holding shots longer than expected (much like Ozu), and using spare dialogue, the contrasting emotional outbursts are unforgettable.Much credit should be given to the marvellous cast, without whom none of this would have worked: the aforementioned Belmont (her first film) is superb as the daughter, emotionally killed by her father; Freddie Cunliffe (also his first film) is very good as the confused younger brother who stumbles on the terrible secret; Tilda Swinton is sympathetic as the oblivious mother; and Ray Winstone, as the monstrous father, still manages to bring a touch of pity to his role. And while one could reasonably argue that Roth goes a bit too far in some scenes for shock value, the bottom-line is that he makes it work. It's a film you won't soon forget.",5,"Tim Roth, we hardly knew ya",978048000,"12 29, 2000",2000,2119,"['When', 'Interiors', 'was', 'released', 'years', 'ago', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'fans', 'were', 'surprisingly', 'introduced', 'better', 'worse', 'dimension', 'comic', 'film-maker', 'never', 'knew', 'existed', 'arrival', 'film', 'certainly', 'surprised', 'many', 'regards', 'maker', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'here', 'see', 'side', 'Pumpkin', 'Mr.', 'Orange', 'Roth', 'breakthrough', 'roles', 'two', 'Tarantino', 'films', 'may', 'have', 'seen', 'hints', 'never', 'prepared', 'something', 'Not', 'only', 'Roth', 'demonstrate', 'eagerness', 'be', 'involved', 'very', 'dark', 'very', 'serious', 'Bergman-esque', 'melodrama', 'doing', 'so', 'unequivocally', 'facility', 'being', 'directing', 'hand', 'depressing', 'dreary', 'story', 'family', 'ripped', 'apart', 'incest', 'emotionally', 'draining', 'not', 'tastes', 'Roth', 'very', 'impressive', 'directorial', 'debut', 'atmosphere', 'unbearable', 'hopelessness', 'using', 'isolated', 'rocky', 'locations', 'soaked', 'rain', 'wind', 'cold', 'photographed', 'muted', 'blues', 'grays', 'Roth', 'film', 'canvas', 'resembles', 'something', 'Picasso', 'blue', 'period', 'amazingly', 'sad', 'face', 'Lara', 'Belmont', 'abused', 'daughter', 'echoing', 'gaunt', 'pale', 'harlequins', 'master', 'works', 'also', 'remiscient', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'story', 'texture', 'have', 'look', 'Persona', ""'ll"", 'swear', 'two', 'films', 'were', 'shot', 'same', 'beaches', 'holding', 'shots', 'longer', 'expected', 'much', 'Ozu', 'using', 'spare', 'dialogue', 'contrasting', 'emotional', 'outbursts', 'are', 'unforgettable.Much', 'credit', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'marvellous', 'cast', 'whom', 'none', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'aforementioned', 'Belmont', 'first', 'film', 'superb', 'daughter', 'emotionally', 'killed', 'father', 'Freddie', 'Cunliffe', 'also', 'first', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'confused', 'younger', 'brother', 'who', 'terrible', 'secret', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'sympathetic', 'oblivious', 'mother', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'monstrous', 'father', 'still', 'bring', 'touch', 'pity', 'role', 'one', 'could', 'reasonably', 'argue', 'Roth', 'bit', 'too', 'far', 'scenes', 'shock', 'value', 'bottom-line', 'work', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'soon', 'forget']",N/A

184858,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,1567301770,"""flickjunkie""","[23, 26]","""The War Zone"" is a brilliant and sordid character study of a dysfunctional family plagued by incest.  This is Tim Roth's directorial debut and he clearly decided he was not going to play it safe.  The film is a raw portrayal of the complex family dynamics that result from sex and sexual desire between family members.With the help of cinematographer Seamus Mc Garvey, Roth takes an art house approach to story telling, with masterfully bleak cinematography and inspired use of the camera.  Especially effective is his use of silence, increasing the discomforting tone of the entire film.  His unabashed presentation of the stark depravity and the raw emotion wields the impact of a cold slap in the face, simultaneously stinging and holding our undivided attention.The character study of Jessie (Lara Belmont) and Tom (Freddie Cunliffe) is excellent, but leaves one of the most important questions nebulous.  Roth flirts with the siblings' incestuous desire for one another, but leaves it implied, which I thought was inconsistent with his otherwise forthright style of storytelling.  Was Tom motivated by love for his sister or by jealousy of his father's sexual competition?  Was he his sister's protector or his father's rival?  Both elements seem to be there, but Roth doesn't clarify.  Although I have not read Alexander Stuart's book (upon which the screenplay is based), I understand that Tom's sexual jealousy was an important part of the story, so I don't understand why Roth danced around it.  The story also could have benefited by a closer look into Jessie's feelings about her father.  Was it strictly revulsion for repeated violations, or was she a willing participant?  Again, both seem to be present, but we never really know.  Moreover, the final scene fails to bring closure to the film, a closure that the viewer desperately needs after being juiced in an emotional blender.  Yet, even with these unresolved issues, this is exceptional work for a first time director (or any director for that matter).The acting is phenomenal, especially when one considers that this is the film debut for both Belmont and Cunliffe.  Lara Belmont presents a young woman being torn asunder by an emotional tornado, trying to appear as if nothing is amiss especially in front of her mother.  Belmont's performance is provocative and gut wrenching.  Freddie Cunliffe captures the desperation of Tom's dilemma with a sullen rage that emanates from his placid exterior.  Given their ages and experience, both actors give unbelievably mature performances, again a tribute to Roth's directorial ability.This dark and unsettling film is skillfully directed and compellingly acted.  I rated it a 9/10.  It requires a courageous and intelligent viewer with a thick skin.  It is decidedly not for the viewer who is put off by frank depictions of sex and incest.

As a director, the first-timer Tim Roth is very impressive - he created the atmosphere that makes a viewer suffocated, uncomfortable, and hurt which is appropriate for this type of film. The most talked about scene in a bunker between a father and his teenage daughter as seen by the eyes of their son and brother, Tom is handled with such incredible array of quietly screaming emotions and pain that it almost overpowers the similar scene in ""Irreversible"" (believe it or not). It is very powerful piece of film-making and deserves all its praise and awards. There is a little ""but"", though. One of the reasons I wanted to see the film was to compare it to the Alexander Stuart's novel of the same title which the film was based on.

The movie is a tale about emotion and coming to grips with it.  There are deeper problems than the incest that goes on between the daughter and father.  That is only a symptom.  Unfortunately, as the movie underscores, the incest ruins everyone elses lives as well.Visually it is a beautiful film, filled with drab water-color images.  The entire movie you do not know what the hero/intercedory brother is thinking; which is normal for a 15 year old young man.I think the best thing about the movie is that although everyone outwardly acts in a similar fashion, the characters are all so different, making for a wonderful conflict and climax (please don't read into that!).Many sexual-phobes are afraid to watch this movie because they're afraid they'll get turned on by watching the one infamous incestual scene.

He has tackled an ugly subject -- incest and child abuse -- and filmed it in such a beautiful way that the viewer is compelled to confront it.  His early training as a painter is very apparent in his choice of camera angles, in the lingering views of the life of this wounded family in the bleak, rainy Devon countryside.  The script, written by Alexander Stuart, has undergone several changes in the transition from his novel, in both character development and story line.  Having read the novel after I saw the film, I can only speculate that Mr. Roth's vision had a lot to do with the alterations.  In comparison to the novel, they make the story more palatable to the general audience, and, I think, more plausable in relation to the occurance of such events in our society.  This is easily one of the most powerful films I have ever seen -- I literally squirmed in my seat when I saw it in the theatre, and the effect was no less when I viewed the video.

There's Tom, the younger teenage brother, played by Freddie Cunliffe who is depressed and angry that he was forced to leave his friends behind. Because of the extra time on his hands he's able to see things within his family he never noticed before.There's Jessie, played by Lara Belmont, who plays the eldest daughter. She's sad, withdrawn and sexually promiscuous with both men and women. She's very close with her baby brother, Tom, and at times you wonder if their relationship is inappropriate.Mum (Tilda Swinton), is having another baby, and hasn't been able to sleep. She's frustrated and wanting to go back to work. Dad (Ray Winstone), appears on the surface to be a loyal and loving husband and father.This is a devastating story about incest and how each member deals with it (but specifically Tom). Tom is the first to discover what is going on between his sister and father. I really didn't know for sure from the beginning but looking back all the signs were obvious. Tom confronts his sister who denies it at first. He blames her viciously at first taking out his anger on her instead of his father. They continue to keep it quiet but Tom begins to fear, once the baby Alice is born, that she'll be Dad's next victim.This film was well written, acted and filmed.

(A discussion of how &quot;willing&quot; she is to go along with this isn't appropriate, and I don't want to talk about that; it's more of a subject for the newsgroups for discussion of surviving child abuse.)  This scene is filmed in such a way that, even though it is very explicit, it does not seem like cheap exploitation.  Rather, it's showing us the act, in all of its ugly depravity, because the only way for us to understand the truth of what is happening in this unholy union is to see it with our own eyes.The movie is one of those that dares to ask questions -- and not answer them.  The subject matter is such that there are no easy answers, and to provide some sort of an &quot;answer&quot; would be a retreat from the harsh truths presented here.  I think that's why, at the end of the film, we aren't even told if the young boy did indeed kill his father, or what happens next.  This isn't a film that gives us glib, easy answers....  Rather, it makes us aware that this horror does indeed exist in our world -- indeed, in the very town we live in -- and that there are no simple answers.

He and his family have transferred from London to an isolated country house near the sea. His pregnant mother (Tilda Swinton) quietly misses London, but his father (Ray Winstone) and older sister Jessie (Lara Belmont) stay occupied with work and college searches. The family spends their days trudging through rain or cozying up at home. They hardly notice when Tom, already sullen, discovers something that shakes him into near silence.The War Zone (based on a book by Alexander Stuart) depicts a situation that is theoretically simple and in actuality anything but. Told from the perspective not of a knowing outsider but of innocence as it is being lost, Tim Roth's directorial debut is uniquely powerful. Its most appalling moments are justified, even crucial.The camera lingers on small figures surrounded by green and gray and pummeled by the elements. The ocean's rhythmic violence and the setting's physical remoteness clearly reflect the family's emotional trials. The repetitive, sometimes sentimental soundtrack is still effective.Tom's impenetrability ultimately works, but Cunliffe's lack of expressions is off-putting in comparison to Belmont's harrowing performance as Jessie. Thespians Swinton and Winstone are understated and excellent as the parents. The sparse, mumbled dialogue is naturalistic if occasionally heavy handed (and difficult for Americans to understand).The film offers no explanations and leaves on an ambiguous note, forcing viewers to identify with its tender protagonists. In spite of its bleak portrayal of youth overwhelmed by confusion, The War Zone has changed lives.

The subject of incest has, for whatever reason, come into fashion over the last few years (&quot;Eve's Bayou&quot;, &quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot;, &quot;The Celebration&quot;, etc.), but none of them has tackled the issue as straight-on as Roth has.  The children's behaviour toward the act -- the daughter's nihilism and the son's bleak withdrawal -- are realistic and believable (her's as a mean of fooling herself that it's her fault, and his's a natural response borne from his confusion and disgust), but that's also the primary problem of the film.  Right from the beginning of the film, the grimness and self-destructiveness of the characters are so oppressive that it never provides the viewer a point of entry into the film.  By the time the unsavoury act is depicted, the misery of it all weighed on me so heavily that I was tempted to look away.  It almost seems like the film relishes in exploiting the misery of the family (like when someone tells you a sordid story and although you wanted to hear all about it initially, your desire is lessened as more and more wretched details are revealed until you no longer want to hear the story, but the storyteller continues on enthusiastically).  I realize this is a serious subject and maybe it's because I've never experienced the consequences of incest firsthand, but I could not get myself involved in the story.  However, with that said, this film has stuck with me.  Roth doesn't provide an easy way out for us by explaining the motivations and actions of each character.  We have to figure that out ourselves later, even though we may not want to, and for that, Roth must be commended.",4,Not for the weak of heart,1002067200,"10 3, 2001",2001,1772,"['one', 'hand', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'admire', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'depicting', 'what', 'was', 'once', 'most', 'taboo', 'issues', 'so', 'unflinchingly', 'subject', 'incest', 'reason', 'come', 'fashion', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'quot', 'Eve', 'Bayou', 'quot', 'quot', 'Sweet', 'Hereafter', 'quot', 'quot', 'Celebration', 'quot', 'etc', 'none', 'tackled', 'issue', 'as', 'straight-on', 'Roth', 'children', 'behaviour', 'act', 'daughter', 'nihilism', 'son', 'bleak', 'withdrawal', 'are', 'realistic', 'believable', 'mean', 'fooling', 'fault', 'natural', 'response', 'borne', 'confusion', 'disgust', 'also', 'primary', 'problem', 'film', 'Right', 'beginning', 'film', 'grimness', 'self-destructiveness', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'oppressive', 'never', 'viewer', 'point', 'entry', 'film', 'time', 'unsavoury', 'act', 'depicted', 'misery', 'weighed', 'heavily', 'was', 'tempted', 'look', 'away', 'almost', 'film', 'relishes', 'exploiting', 'misery', 'family', 'when', 'someone', 'sordid', 'story', 'wanted', 'hear', 'initially', 'desire', 'lessened', 'more', 'more', 'wretched', 'details', 'are', 'revealed', 'no', 'longer', 'want', 'hear', 'story', 'storyteller', 'enthusiastically', 'realize', 'serious', 'subject', 'maybe', ""'ve"", 'never', 'experienced', 'consequences', 'incest', 'firsthand', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'involved', 'story', 'However', 'said', 'film', 'stuck', 'Roth', ""n't"", 'provide', 'easy', 'way', 'explaining', 'motivations', 'actions', 'character', 'have', 'figure', 'out', 'later', 'even', 'may', 'not', 'want', 'Roth', 'must', 'be', 'commended']",N/A

We all know by now what an accomplished actor Roth is, and now we have the pleasure of watching him direct.  The War Zone is one, hit's you right between the eyes, films.  It pulls at your heart and dosn't let go until you are so full of anger, that you find yourself cursing and screaming at the tv.  The imagry is something that will stick with you long after the movie has ended.  The cinematography is absolutly sureal, and the actors and actresses are exceptional.  This film takes an inside look at a normal everyday family, with a very dark and unsettling secrect.  I think for Roth to tackle a subject such as incest in his first film as a director, shows just how confident an actor he really is.  This film took a lot of courage to throw out there and I applaud him for doing it.  The story is that of a family that people can relate to.  One of the things Roth did perfectly, was to make them seem like the perfect ""Brady Bunch"" family.  The mother was a caring woman that took good care of her husband and her children.  The father was one that any of us would look at as a loving and caring man.  The two teenagers seemed like normal teenagers, quiet, intraverted, and just struggling with their mid-teen years.  But deep within this normal looking family is a secrect that is one of the most evil crimes that can be bestowed upon anyone.  The film opens with the mother giving birth to their third child, which is their second daughter.  Everthing seems to be normal until the brother sees his sister in the bathtub with the father.  He knows what he just witnessed and confronts his sister about it, but she just blows it off as a misconception on his part.  Once he finds some photographs of the two of them in the nude, he is sure of how evil his father really is.  When the sister doesn't seem to want to do anything about the situation, he must stuggle with his morality, and his desire to put a stop to the madness.  But he also dosn't want to tear the family apart.  Then one night his mother wakes him up and tells him that the baby is sick and they are taking her to the hospitial.  After a while, he and his sister drive home together.  They are home for a while when he decides to go back to the hospitial to see his mom.  When he is in the room, the mother starts to change the baby's diaper, and he notices that there is blood inside.  Fearing the worst, he tells his mother not to trust him, not to let him around the baby.  He leaves and heads home, knowing that his father is already there, alone with his sister.  When he gets home the father is in a rage, after speaking to the mother on the phone(where she tells him to pack up and get out), and asks him what he had said to his mother.  He tells the father he knows everthing and a fight breaks out between them.  I'm not going to give away the ending, you have to see it for yourself.  I also purposly didn't use any names in this review because I think you should watch this movie to get a more personal aspect of the characters.  I think everyone in the film was exceptional, but in my opionion, the girl who played the sister stole the show.  The pain and emotion she showed was incredably believable and moving.  This is a very depressing film, but one that should definatly be seen by all.  A subject that is not addressed enough and one that should be taught to all.  I truly hope this is the start of a long career of directing for Tim Roth, as I also hope he will continue to act in films.  He is absolutely brilliant...",5,FROM THE MIND OF TIM ROTH.....,1019088000,"04 18, 2002",2002,3574,"['Tim', 'Roth', 'directorial', 'debut', 'nothing', 'short', 'brilliant', 'know', 'now', 'what', 'accomplished', 'actor', 'Roth', 'now', 'have', 'pleasure', 'watching', 'direct', 'War', 'Zone', 'one', 'hit', 'right', 'eyes', 'films', 'heart', 'dos', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'are', 'so', 'full', 'anger', 'find', 'cursing', 'screaming', 'tv', 'imagry', 'something', 'will', 'stick', 'long', 'movie', 'ended', 'cinematography', 'absolutly', 'sureal', 'actors', 'actresses', 'are', 'exceptional', 'film', 'inside', 'look', 'normal', 'everyday', 'family', 'very', 'dark', 'unsettling', 'secrect', 'think', 'Roth', 'tackle', 'subject', 'such', 'incest', 'first', 'film', 'director', 'just', 'how', 'confident', 'actor', 'really', 'film', 'took', 'lot', 'courage', 'throw', 'out', 'there', 'applaud', 'doing', 'story', 'family', 'people', 'can', 'relate', 'One', 'things', 'Roth', 'did', 'perfectly', 'was', 'make', 'seem', 'perfect', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'family', 'mother', 'was', 'caring', 'woman', 'took', 'good', 'care', 'husband', 'children', 'father', 'was', 'one', 'would', 'look', 'loving', 'caring', 'man', 'two', 'teenagers', 'seemed', 'normal', 'teenagers', 'quiet', 'intraverted', 'just', 'struggling', 'mid-teen', 'years', 'deep', 'normal', 'looking', 'family', 'secrect', 'one', 'most', 'evil', 'crimes', 'can', 'be', 'bestowed', 'anyone', 'film', 'mother', 'giving', 'birth', 'third', 'child', 'second', 'daughter', 'Everthing', 'be', 'normal', 'brother', 'sister', 'bathtub', 'father', 'what', 'just', 'witnessed', 'confronts', 'sister', 'just', 'off', 'misconception', 'part', 'Once', 'photographs', 'two', 'nude', 'sure', 'how', 'evil', 'father', 'really', 'When', 'sister', ""n't"", 'seem', 'want', 'do', 'anything', 'situation', 'must', 'stuggle', 'morality', 'desire', 'put', 'stop', 'madness', 'also', 'dos', ""n't"", 'want', 'tear', 'family', 'apart', 'Then', 'one', 'night', 'mother', 'wakes', 'up', 'baby', 'sick', 'are', 'taking', 'hospitial', 'while', 'sister', 'drive', 'home', 'together', 'are', 'home', 'while', 'when', 'go', 'back', 'hospitial', 'see', 'mom', 'When', 'room', 'mother', 'change', 'baby', 'diaper', 'blood', 'inside', 'Fearing', 'worst', 'mother', 'not', 'trust', 'not', 'let', 'baby', 'home', 'knowing', 'father', 'already', 'there', 'alone', 'sister', 'When', 'father', 'rage', 'speaking', 'mother', 'phone', 'where', 'pack', 'up', 'get', 'out', 'what', 'had', 'said', 'mother', 'father', 'everthing', 'fight', 'out', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'have', 'see', 'also', 'purposly', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'names', 'review', 'think', 'should', 'watch', 'movie', 'get', 'more', 'personal', 'aspect', 'characters', 'think', 'everyone', 'film', 'was', 'exceptional', 'opionion', 'girl', 'who', 'played', 'sister', 'stole', 'show', 'pain', 'emotion', 'showed', 'was', 'incredably', 'believable', 'moving', 'very', 'depressing', 'film', 'one', 'should', 'definatly', 'be', 'seen', 'subject', 'not', 'addressed', 'enough', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'taught', 'truly', 'hope', 'start', 'long', 'career', 'directing', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'also', 'hope', 'will', 'continue', 'act', 'films', 'absolutely', 'brilliant']",N/A

It also proves that Tim Roth is not only a great actor(FOUR ROOMS,RESOVOIR DOGS) he can now be considered to be a solid filmmaker. This is his directing debut.I have to warn you that this film may not be for everyone and is difficult to watch. It deals with a powerful story that not many people would try to tackle head on. Truly one of the best less known, films available.This film is unforgettable. It's about the boy who trys to save his family. The actors turn in brilliant performances lead by Ray Winstone(SEXY BEAST). He plays the father who eventually is unable to hide his hidden secret. Forget the Oscars, this was some of the best acting this year. Plus see if you can spot Collin Farrell(The New World) in this film. It won't be easy but he's in a scene.This type of movie does not come around often but it's one that you can't stop watching once the film begins. Do yourself a favor and check into this film. Should've been nominated for at least 4 awards including Best Actor and Director. This DVD has audio commentary and the making of the film.",4,Worth a serious look!,1063324800,"09 12, 2003",2003,1159,"['One', 'sleeper', 'hits', '1999', 'CROUPIER', 'being', 'other', 'film', 'artistic', 'masterpiece', 'also', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'not', 'only', 'great', 'actor', 'FOUR', 'ROOMS', 'RESOVOIR', 'DOGS', 'can', 'now', 'be', 'considered', 'be', 'solid', 'filmmaker', 'directing', 'debut.I', 'have', 'warn', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'difficult', 'watch', 'powerful', 'story', 'not', 'many', 'people', 'would', 'try', 'tackle', 'head', 'Truly', 'one', 'best', 'less', 'known', 'films', 'available.This', 'film', 'unforgettable', 'boy', 'who', 'save', 'family', 'actors', 'turn', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'lead', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'SEXY', 'BEAST', 'father', 'who', 'eventually', 'unable', 'hide', 'hidden', 'secret', 'Forget', 'Oscars', 'was', 'best', 'acting', 'year', 'see', 'can', 'spot', 'Collin', 'Farrell', 'New', 'World', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'easy', 'scene.This', 'type', 'movie', 'not', 'come', 'around', 'often', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'watching', 'once', 'film', 'Do', 'favor', 'check', 'film', 'Should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'nominated', 'least', '4', 'awards', 'including', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Director', 'DVD', 'audio', 'commentary', 'making', 'film']",N/A
