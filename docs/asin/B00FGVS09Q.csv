1671647,A2PV6GK1HV54Y9,B00FGVS09Q,ADRIENNE MILLER,"[0, 0]","Kathryn Hahn is a gifted actress but before Afternoon Delight, she got stuck portraying a supporting character, (in films like Revolutionary Road and Our Idiot Brother) that she never really got an opportunity to show what she can do. Hahn can be so raw and serious one moment, and deadpan hilarious the next. I'm happy that Hahn finally got to play the lead in this dark, brooding drama. Afternoon Delight is about a bored, unsatisfied housewife who takes in a young, bubbly stripper played by the equally talented Juno Temple. This movie is not for everyone. The subject matter can be a bit of heavy at times. The great performances by Hahn and Temple are what makes this film worth a viewing or two. I liked this movie because it is honest and unflinching. People aren't always what they seem, and trying to change someone or make them happy is a huge responsibility that might backfire. Afternoon Delight is the kind of film that you need to have an open mind about. Give it a chance.

1671650,A1KONL8ECYFG37,B00FGVS09Q,DVD Verdict,"[0, 1]","Quentin Tarantino infamously dubbed Afternoon Delight one of his favorite films of 2013, and for the first half-hour or so I found his position at least semi-understandable. Jill Soloway's film begins in exceptional fashion, crafting a superbly satirical yet honest portrait of a faltering suburban marriage and loading her movie with complex, well-drawn characters. We have far too few films that offer a thoroughly female perspective on life, and it wasn't long before I was ready to go anywhere Soloway, Hahn and Temple felt inclined to take me. Alas, things start getting shaky midway through and turn disastrous by the final act.Initially, it seems as if we're getting the sort of nuanced critique of suburban life that American Beauty should have been. The film has affection for its characters while ruthlessly undercutting their self-absorbed way of life, and the jokes are largely smart observations rather than easy cheap shots (such as a scene in which Rachel sheepishly admits that she's contemplated getting a maid even though she doesn't actually have a job herself). I loved the portrait of McKenna, too: she's not just a good-hearted stripper for our protagonist to save, but a smart, self-aware businesswoman who's perfectly willing to accept some small moral compromises in order to make a decent living. In fact, Temple's performance is so solid that I was genuinely startled that I realized the movie ultimately doesn't have any interest in her.By the final act, we come to the crushing realization that McKenna is merely a plot device&#8212;her sole purpose is to help Rachel and her hubby spice up their marriage a bit. Sure, McKenna takes some bad turns and seems headed towards an uncertain destination by the time the film reaches the finish line, but that doesn't particularly matter since Rachel is having orgasms again. That may sound like a low blow, but that's ultimately what the movie boils down to (a notion emphasized by the explicit, orgasmic closing shot). This only adds to the feeling that the whole thing is a bit classist, suggesting that the wealthy might have a few things to learn from working-class folks but that the two sides ultimately don't mix well. It begins as a great character study, and eventually turns into the ultimate Rich White People Problems movie.That's a shame, especially since Hahn is absolutely deserving of a showcase like this. She's been doing stellar work in comedies (both indie and mainstream) for years, and her work here is simply terrific. She's alternately funny, lovable and terrifying&#8212;in fact, she's all three simultaneously in a superbly-acted scene that finds Hahn having a meltdown at a friendly social gathering. Unfortunately, that scene is intercut with an awful, fairly ridiculous scene in which the husband and his bros turn into slobbering pigs once McKenna starts flirting with them. Jane Lynch is appealing in her supporting role, though she often seems disconnected from the rest of the movie. It's a pity to see the phenomenally talented Keegan Michael-Key (of Key & Peele fame) wasted in a throwaway supporting role.Afternoon Delight (Blu-ray) has received a strong 1080p/1.85:1 transfer that offers superb detail and bright, vibrant colors. It doesn't do a whole lot to distinguish itself visually from many indie comedies, but this is a consistently exceptional transfer. Shadow delineation is stellar throughout, and depth is impressive. The DTS HD 5.1 Master Audio track is appealing, but simple. It's a dialogue-driven flick that only gives your surround speakers something to do when the rock songs on the soundtrack kick into gear. Supplements include a commentary with Soloway and Hahn, seven very short making-of featurettes (running twenty minutes combined), deleted scenes, a trailer and a DVD copy.Clark Douglas, VERDICTRead the full review at dvdverdict.com",3,Leaves the viewer much more unsatisfied than it leaves Hahn and Radnor.,1392681600,"02 18, 2014",2014,3868,"['Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'infamously', 'dubbed', 'Afternoon', 'Delight', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', '2013', 'first', 'half-hour', 'so', 'found', 'position', 'least', 'semi-understandable', 'Jill', 'Soloway', 'film', 'exceptional', 'fashion', 'crafting', 'superbly', 'satirical', 'yet', 'honest', 'portrait', 'faltering', 'suburban', 'marriage', 'loading', 'movie', 'complex', 'well-drawn', 'characters', 'have', 'far', 'too', 'few', 'films', 'offer', 'thoroughly', 'female', 'perspective', 'life', 'was', ""n't"", 'long', 'before', 'was', 'ready', 'go', 'anywhere', 'Soloway', 'Hahn', 'Temple', 'felt', 'inclined', 'take', 'Alas', 'things', 'start', 'getting', 'shaky', 'midway', 'turn', 'disastrous', 'final', 'act.Initially', ""'re"", 'getting', 'sort', 'nuanced', 'critique', 'suburban', 'life', 'American', 'Beauty', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'film', 'affection', 'characters', 'ruthlessly', 'undercutting', 'self-absorbed', 'way', 'life', 'jokes', 'are', 'largely', 'smart', 'observations', 'rather', 'easy', 'cheap', 'shots', 'such', 'scene', 'Rachel', 'sheepishly', 'admits', 'contemplated', 'getting', 'maid', 'even', ""n't"", 'actually', 'have', 'job', 'loved', 'portrait', 'McKenna', 'too', 'not', 'just', 'good-hearted', 'stripper', 'protagonist', 'save', 'smart', 'self-aware', 'businesswoman', 'who', 'perfectly', 'willing', 'accept', 'small', 'moral', 'compromises', 'order', 'make', 'decent', 'living', 'fact', 'Temple', 'performance', 'so', 'solid', 'was', 'genuinely', 'startled', 'realized', 'movie', 'ultimately', ""n't"", 'have', 'interest', 'final', 'act', 'come', 'crushing', 'realization', 'McKenna', 'merely', 'plot', 'device', '8212', 'sole', 'purpose', 'help', 'Rachel', 'hubby', 'spice', 'up', 'marriage', 'bit', 'Sure', 'McKenna', 'bad', 'turns', 'headed', 'towards', 'uncertain', 'destination', 'time', 'film', 'finish', 'line', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'matter', 'Rachel', 'having', 'orgasms', 'again', 'may', 'sound', 'low', 'blow', 'ultimately', 'what', 'movie', 'down', 'notion', 'emphasized', 'explicit', 'orgasmic', 'closing', 'shot', 'only', 'feeling', 'whole', 'thing', 'bit', 'classist', 'suggesting', 'wealthy', 'might', 'have', 'few', 'things', 'learn', 'working-class', 'folks', 'two', 'sides', 'ultimately', 'do', ""n't"", 'mix', 'well', 'great', 'character', 'study', 'eventually', 'ultimate', 'Rich', 'White', 'People', 'Problems', 'movie.That', 'shame', 'especially', 'Hahn', 'absolutely', 'deserving', 'showcase', 'been', 'doing', 'stellar', 'work', 'comedies', 'indie', 'mainstream', 'years', 'work', 'here', 'simply', 'terrific', 'alternately', 'funny', 'lovable', 'terrifying', '8212', 'fact', 'three', 'simultaneously', 'superbly-acted', 'scene', 'Hahn', 'having', 'meltdown', 'friendly', 'social', 'gathering', 'Unfortunately', 'scene', 'intercut', 'awful', 'fairly', 'ridiculous', 'scene', 'husband', 'bros', 'turn', 'slobbering', 'pigs', 'once', 'McKenna', 'flirting', 'Jane', 'Lynch', 'appealing', 'supporting', 'role', 'often', 'disconnected', 'rest', 'movie', 'pity', 'see', 'phenomenally', 'talented', 'Keegan', 'Michael-Key', 'Key', 'Peele', 'fame', 'wasted', 'throwaway', 'supporting', 'role.Afternoon', 'Delight', 'Blu-ray', 'received', 'strong', '1080p/1.85:1', 'transfer', 'superb', 'detail', 'bright', 'vibrant', 'colors', ""n't"", 'do', 'whole', 'lot', 'distinguish', 'visually', 'many', 'indie', 'comedies', 'consistently', 'exceptional', 'transfer', 'Shadow', 'delineation', 'stellar', 'depth', 'impressive', 'DTS', 'HD', '5.1', 'Master', 'Audio', 'track', 'appealing', 'simple', 'dialogue-driven', 'flick', 'only', 'surround', 'speakers', 'something', 'do', 'when', 'rock', 'songs', 'soundtrack', 'kick', 'gear', 'Supplements', 'include', 'commentary', 'Soloway', 'Hahn', 'seven', 'very', 'short', 'making-of', 'featurettes', 'running', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'combined', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'trailer', 'DVD', 'copy.Clark', 'Douglas', 'VERDICTRead', 'full', 'review', 'dvdverdict.com']",N/A
1671651,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00FGVS09Q,FNDNreview,"[4, 5]","Jill Soloway, who has previously written for and served as a produced for shows that include Six Feet Under and How to Make It in America, pens and directs Afternoon Delight. The film stars Kathryn Hahn as Rachel, a mother of one that spends her days either at home, planning preschool activities, and with a therapist, Lenore (Jane Lynch) - talking about her sexless marriage.Rachel is married to Jeff (Josh Radnor), and the couple's obvious comfort level has led to a stale marriage to the extent that neither of them appears to be overly happy. In order to spice things up, Rachel takes the advice of her close friend, Stephanie (Jessica St. Clair), to take her husband to a local strip club.At the club, Jeff buys Rachel a lap dance from a stripper, named McKenna (Juno Temple). Rachel is quickly intrigued by McKenna's choice in lifestyle and repeatedly uses her love for coffee as an excuse to keep bumping into her on the street. As it just so happens, McKenna finds herself in a bind without a place to live. Naturally, Rachel thinks it's a good idea for McKenna to stay with her and Jeff - and also serve as their live-in &#34;babysitter.&#34;The more information Rachel learns about McKenna, the more she's intrigued by what she discovers about her. It turns out that not only does McKenna dance at the club, but she also serves as a &#34;sex worker&#34; - in other words, a call girl. Even though the news is shocking at first, it's still an element of excitement that Rachel decides to incorporate into her life. But, it turns out that McKenna's &#34;free&#34; lifestyle doesn't translate very well to the suburban household of a married couple with a child - or to the lives of their neighboring friends.Kathryn Hahn, probably most recognizable from her roll in the former NBC TV series, Crossing Jordan, portrays a mediocre character. She's what you might call under whelming, not because Hahn does a poor job with the character, but because the character itself is written in such a shoulder-shrugging manner. From one scene to the next, she goes about her day - continuously making choices like a two-year-old child that's doesn't understand the consequences of her actions. In essence, it's only a matter of time before Rachel screws up her life.Rachel, the obvious focal character of the film, is undoubtedly a boring character. However, it's hard to believe that an individual of her mental build would require therapy - but without the therapy, there'd be no reason to have Jane Lynch in the picture. It's funny how that works. Normally, Lynch brings a high does of creativity and excitement to her roles, but in this case, the therapist seems like an absolutely worthless character that does very little to move this film in either a positive or negative direction.One of the other main characters of the film, Jeff - portrayed by Josh Radnor, who most will recognize as the central character in NBC's prime time comedy, How I Met Your Mother, is another bland individual that will garner viewer indifference. Jeff is a relatively emotionless personality that simply goes through the everyday motions of being a typical husband and father. He goes to work, comes home, goes to sleep - and occasionally hangs out with the guys. The substance of this character is virtually non-existent, and that noticeably translates to the lacking chemistry between Hahn and Radnor.While both Hahn and Radnor basically chug along on cruise control, Juno Temple is able to be the shining star and set herself above the rest of the pack. What happens when you introduce a seemingly innocent young stripper in a boring world of predictability? Fireworks. Temple's character introduces the unknown (some might even call it chaos) into a sheltered, average neighborhood - thus creating the underlying theme and point of the story. Temple's portrayal is delightfully unhinged, though charming when she needs to be, and downright sleazy when she's out for revenge. Without a doubt, Juno Temple is the driving force that makes this film go.Overall, Afternoon Delight is far from captivating, but still manages to present a relatively fresh story - even though it takes quite a while to really gain momentum. The characters are often drab, lack substantial depth, and simply don't create that much interest. Juno Temple is easily the bright spot of the film, serving no real purpose other than adding spice to a married couple's completely boring life. Still, this film is one of those stories with an array of hidden messages within it - like &#34;you don't know what you have until you lose it&#34; or discovering that not everyone is capable of being saved or reformed. Regardless, unless you're a diehard fan of any of the four semi-famous stars of this film, there's really not much to see to make it worth a view.GRADE: C-FNDNreview.com",2,'Afternoon Delight' far from captivating...,1393286400,"02 25, 2014",2014,4838,"['Jill', 'Soloway', 'who', 'previously', 'written', 'served', 'produced', 'shows', 'include', 'Six', 'Feet', 'How', 'Make', 'America', 'pens', 'directs', 'Afternoon', 'Delight', 'film', 'stars', 'Kathryn', 'Hahn', 'Rachel', 'mother', 'one', 'days', 'home', 'planning', 'preschool', 'activities', 'therapist', 'Lenore', 'Jane', 'Lynch', 'talking', 'sexless', 'marriage.Rachel', 'married', 'Jeff', 'Josh', 'Radnor', 'couple', 'obvious', 'comfort', 'level', 'led', 'stale', 'marriage', 'extent', 'be', 'overly', 'happy', 'order', 'spice', 'things', 'up', 'Rachel', 'advice', 'close', 'friend', 'Stephanie', 'Jessica', 'St.', 'Clair', 'take', 'husband', 'local', 'strip', 'club.At', 'club', 'Jeff', 'Rachel', 'lap', 'dance', 'stripper', 'named', 'McKenna', 'Juno', 'Temple', 'Rachel', 'quickly', 'intrigued', 'McKenna', 'choice', 'lifestyle', 'repeatedly', 'love', 'coffee', 'excuse', 'keep', 'bumping', 'street', 'just', 'so', 'happens', 'McKenna', 'bind', 'place', 'live', 'Naturally', 'Rachel', 'good', 'idea', 'McKenna', 'stay', 'Jeff', 'also', 'serve', 'live-in', '34', 'babysitter.', '34', 'more', 'information', 'Rachel', 'McKenna', 'more', 'intrigued', 'what', 'out', 'not', 'only', 'McKenna', 'dance', 'club', 'also', '34', 'sex', 'worker', '34', 'other', 'words', 'call', 'girl', 'Even', 'news', 'shocking', 'first', 'still', 'element', 'excitement', 'Rachel', 'incorporate', 'life', 'out', 'McKenna', '34', 'free', '34', 'lifestyle', ""n't"", 'translate', 'very', 'well', 'suburban', 'household', 'married', 'couple', 'child', 'lives', 'neighboring', 'friends.Kathryn', 'Hahn', 'probably', 'most', 'recognizable', 'roll', 'former', 'NBC', 'TV', 'series', 'Crossing', 'Jordan', 'mediocre', 'character', 'what', 'might', 'call', 'whelming', 'not', 'Hahn', 'poor', 'job', 'character', 'character', 'written', 'such', 'shoulder-shrugging', 'manner', 'one', 'scene', 'next', 'day', 'continuously', 'making', 'choices', 'two-year-old', 'child', ""n't"", 'understand', 'consequences', 'actions', 'essence', 'only', 'matter', 'time', 'Rachel', 'up', 'life.Rachel', 'obvious', 'focal', 'character', 'film', 'undoubtedly', 'boring', 'character', 'However', 'hard', 'believe', 'individual', 'mental', 'build', 'would', 'require', 'therapy', 'therapy', ""'d"", 'be', 'reason', 'have', 'Jane', 'Lynch', 'picture', 'funny', 'how', 'Normally', 'Lynch', 'high', 'creativity', 'excitement', 'roles', 'case', 'therapist', 'absolutely', 'worthless', 'character', 'very', 'little', 'move', 'film', 'positive', 'negative', 'direction.One', 'other', 'main', 'characters', 'film', 'Jeff', 'portrayed', 'Josh', 'Radnor', 'who', 'most', 'will', 'recognize', 'central', 'character', 'NBC', 'prime', 'time', 'comedy', 'How', 'Met', 'Mother', 'bland', 'individual', 'will', 'garner', 'viewer', 'indifference', 'Jeff', 'relatively', 'emotionless', 'personality', 'simply', 'everyday', 'motions', 'being', 'typical', 'husband', 'father', 'work', 'home', 'sleep', 'occasionally', 'hangs', 'out', 'guys', 'substance', 'character', 'virtually', 'non-existent', 'noticeably', 'lacking', 'chemistry', 'Hahn', 'Radnor.While', 'Hahn', 'Radnor', 'basically', 'along', 'cruise', 'control', 'Juno', 'Temple', 'able', 'be', 'shining', 'star', 'set', 'rest', 'pack', 'What', 'when', 'introduce', 'seemingly', 'innocent', 'young', 'stripper', 'boring', 'world', 'predictability', 'Fireworks', 'Temple', 'character', 'unknown', 'might', 'even', 'call', 'chaos', 'sheltered', 'average', 'neighborhood', 'thus', 'creating', 'underlying', 'theme', 'point', 'story', 'Temple', 'portrayal', 'delightfully', 'unhinged', 'charming', 'when', 'be', 'downright', 'sleazy', 'when', 'out', 'revenge', 'doubt', 'Juno', 'Temple', 'driving', 'force', 'film', 'go.Overall', 'Afternoon', 'Delight', 'far', 'captivating', 'still', 'present', 'relatively', 'fresh', 'story', 'even', 'quite', 'while', 'really', 'gain', 'momentum', 'characters', 'are', 'often', 'drab', 'lack', 'substantial', 'depth', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'create', 'that', 'much', 'interest', 'Juno', 'Temple', 'easily', 'bright', 'spot', 'film', 'serving', 'real', 'purpose', 'other', 'adding', 'spice', 'married', 'couple', 'completely', 'boring', 'life', 'Still', 'film', 'one', 'stories', 'array', 'hidden', 'messages', '34', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'have', 'lose', '34', 'discovering', 'not', 'everyone', 'capable', 'being', 'saved', 'reformed', 'Regardless', ""'re"", 'diehard', 'fan', 'four', 'semi-famous', 'stars', 'film', 'really', 'not', 'much', 'see', 'make', 'view.GRADE', 'C-FNDNreview.com']",N/A

1671653,A1ZQ89XXUHQG6V,B00FGVS09Q,Jack,"[0, 1]","They have a boring marriage, but it's not a marriage as totally negative movie. It might be more about mental issues, and different people from different places having different views and living different lifestyles. A repressed lady with some past intimacy issues oddly stalks a free-spirited stripper (is it for why she says or is she secretly attracted to something within her). Because I'm so tired of the media and many movies these days being sex-negative (sexuality as bad), I wondered in deciding to watch this if it was sex-positive (as in maybe she learns from the stripper to open up and have fun expressing sexuality and maybe comes to like the stripper and her different sensual lifestyle and maybe they have intimacy) or sex-negative (as in Miss save a ho changes the stripper from so-called bad to so-called good to be a melancholy madonna housewife to be similar to her repressive paradigm and strangely say like many movies these days that sex is bad), and it's sort-of neither as it's in a gray area with so much drama, but it could be said it's slightly more towards the sex-positive as the housewife maybe has some more understanding of the stripper and in that it affirms her marriage with her husband and they benefit from the strippers visit with them as shown in the ending scene. The stripper did not get as much out of the visit aside from a few nights rest, and she might think what's with these people. What happens really is not the strippers fault. The stripper is comfortable with sexuality, pro-sex, understanding of sexuality, and easy-going. The housewife is bored, neurotic, and messed up with a lot of mental issues. When it finally seems like she will finally lighten-up during the massage scene, she's so uptight she doesn't enjoy what would be a dream come true for some relaxed people. This is not a comedy. The actors appear to be following the awkward script, that most people will not acknowledge reflects the current reality for many couples everywhere. After all the drama, the uptight housewife thaws and chills out for a few seconds with her husband, and there is a sigh of delight that this uptight drama is over. There is bored uptight housewives and pathetic boring husbands living the school routine, but it's not an against marriage film, as after she is reawakened (slightly, even if for one afternoon) their marriage seems to be improved in the ending.

In any case, the film stars Kathryn Hahn who usually plays second banana roles in comedies.  Here she gets the lead as Rachel, the wife of Jeff (Josh Radnor) who's one of those guys who develops cell phone apps.  They have one child and live in a yuppie (is that still a word?) neighborhood of L. A.  Rachel is bored.  She's bored with her life, her marriage, her sex life, her friends and regularly sees a shrink played by Jane Lynch.Rachel's best friend Stephanie (Jessica St. Clair) talks Rachel and Jeff into going with them to a strip club.  Stephanie says that it does wonders for her relationship with husband Bo (Keegan-Michael Key).  Once there, Rachel gets a lap dance from a young dancer named McKenna (Juno Temple).  Something clicks and Rachel keeps thinking about the young woman.  Director and writer Jill Soloway does a good job keeping us uncertain as to what Rachel's motives are when she looks up McKenna later.  Rachel subsequently invites McKenna to move in for a couple days after her car is impounded.Husband Jeff is befuddled as well, especially after Rachel offer her a McKenna a job as a sitter for their young son.  He goes with it.  But, does he have a hidden agenda?  There are problems with the married couple's relationship but is McKenna somehow the answer?  While this film does have some edging humor going for it, make no mistake this is a consequential marital drama.  And frankly, you'll never think of Kathryn Hahn as just a funny girl from now on.  Juno Temple, not new to these sexy young woman roles, is exceptional here.  The story line tends to wander a bit here and there, but overall this is a very good film.  If you're looking for something a little different and a little erotic, this is a good one.The Blu ray comes with a 1080p video resolution and a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  While the picture is certainly watchable, I did think it was surprisingly dark.  Not every scene but in many of the softly lit interiors.  The disc comes with a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track and while not overly impressive, certainly gets the job done.  Surrounds come into play at the strip club but that's about it.  This is a dialog heavy film and we shouldn't expect much beyond clear front driven events and that's what we get.  English subtitles are available but that's it.  Extras include a commentary by Soloway and Hahn, a making-of short, a profile of the architect who designed the cool house Rachel and Jeff live in, some deleted scenes, a trailer and some scenes featuring sexy dancing lessons.",4,(BLU RAY REVIEW) A little different and a little erotic,1404777600,"07 8, 2014",2014,2658,"[""'m"", 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'where', 'picked', 'up', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'was', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'list', 'top', 'movies', '2013', 'case', 'film', 'stars', 'Kathryn', 'Hahn', 'who', 'usually', 'second', 'banana', 'roles', 'comedies', 'Here', 'lead', 'Rachel', 'wife', 'Jeff', 'Josh', 'Radnor', 'who', 'one', 'guys', 'who', 'develops', 'cell', 'phone', 'apps', 'have', 'one', 'child', 'live', 'yuppie', 'still', 'word', 'neighborhood', 'L.', 'A.', 'Rachel', 'bored', 'bored', 'life', 'marriage', 'sex', 'life', 'friends', 'regularly', 'shrink', 'played', 'Jane', 'Lynch.Rachel', 'best', 'friend', 'Stephanie', 'Jessica', 'St.', 'Clair', 'talks', 'Rachel', 'Jeff', 'going', 'strip', 'club', 'Stephanie', 'wonders', 'relationship', 'husband', 'Bo', 'Keegan-Michael', 'Key', 'Once', 'there', 'Rachel', 'lap', 'dance', 'young', 'dancer', 'named', 'McKenna', 'Juno', 'Temple', 'Something', 'clicks', 'Rachel', 'thinking', 'young', 'woman', 'Director', 'writer', 'Jill', 'Soloway', 'good', 'job', 'keeping', 'uncertain', 'what', 'Rachel', 'motives', 'are', 'when', 'up', 'McKenna', 'later', 'Rachel', 'subsequently', 'McKenna', 'move', 'couple', 'days', 'car', 'impounded.Husband', 'Jeff', 'befuddled', 'as', 'well', 'especially', 'Rachel', 'offer', 'McKenna', 'job', 'sitter', 'young', 'son', 'have', 'hidden', 'agenda', 'are', 'problems', 'married', 'couple', 'relationship', 'McKenna', 'somehow', 'answer', 'film', 'have', 'edging', 'humor', 'going', 'make', 'mistake', 'consequential', 'marital', 'drama', 'frankly', ""'ll"", 'never', 'think', 'Kathryn', 'Hahn', 'just', 'funny', 'girl', 'now', 'Juno', 'Temple', 'not', 'new', 'sexy', 'young', 'woman', 'roles', 'exceptional', 'here', 'story', 'line', 'wander', 'bit', 'here', 'there', 'overall', 'very', 'good', 'film', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'little', 'different', 'little', 'erotic', 'good', 'one.The', 'Blu', 'ray', '1080p', 'video', 'resolution', '1.85:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'picture', 'certainly', 'watchable', 'did', 'think', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'dark', 'Not', 'scene', 'many', 'softly', 'lit', 'interiors', 'disc', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '5.1', 'track', 'not', 'overly', 'impressive', 'certainly', 'job', 'done', 'come', 'play', 'strip', 'club', 'dialog', 'heavy', 'film', 'should', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'clear', 'front', 'driven', 'events', 'what', 'get', 'English', 'subtitles', 'are', 'available', 'Extras', 'include', 'commentary', 'Soloway', 'Hahn', 'making-of', 'short', 'profile', 'architect', 'who', 'designed', 'cool', 'house', 'Rachel', 'Jeff', 'live', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'trailer', 'scenes', 'featuring', 'sexy', 'dancing', 'lessons']",N/A

As so often in Juno Temple movies, the script doesn't fit a neat category. Some spoilers follow.Rachel (Kathryn Hahn) is a well-to-do suburban mother with a committed upright husband (hardly perfect, but who is?), a bright and healthy pre-school son, and a beautiful house in a nice neighborhood. She is acutely aware intellectually that her problems are First World ones. This intellectual awareness of her advantages doesn't prevent her from being unhappy anyway. ""Is that all there is?"" (to steal a line from Peggy Lee) is the gist of it. Despite the trailer's strong implication that Rachel's husband Jeff (Josh Radnor) is the one who is disinterested, it is Rachel who has deflected sex for the past six months; she would like to feel amorous, she tells her therapist (Jane Lynch), but she doesn't have any enthusiasm for it.On the advice of her girlfriends, Rachel takes her husband to a strip club, where he buys her a private lap dance from a free-spirited dancer/hooker named McKenna (Juno Temple). Later, Rachel encounters McKenna outside the club at a coffee vendor. Unlike Rachel, McKenna seems quite happy with her life. When McKenna needs a new place to stay, Rachel invites her into her home as a nanny despite the reservations of Jeff; she claims she wants to help McKenna, even though Rachel is the one who is discontent. McKenna still services her favorite tricks on the side. Rachel accompanies McKenna on one occasion when she visits an older client (if not outright ugly, certainly unattractive) who likes it when someone watches - creepy as this sounds, in context the fellow is surprisingly gentlemanly about the whole thing. Rachel is very disturbed by the experience.McKenna is an unexceptionable nanny until a neighbor (unaware of McKenna's side job) asks to borrow her as a babysitter one night, and Rachel nixes the idea as inappropriate. McKenna, offended, retaliates by behaving as precisely the untrustworthy trollop Rachel has just treated her as being. A marital crisis ensues, but at the end of it Rachel feels (as well as knows) just how fortunate she is in life, and for that matter so does Jeff.This movie gets very mixed user-reviews, but I think much of the problem is the way it was marketed.

1671662,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00FGVS09Q,Turfseer,"[0, 0]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0Jill Soloway's 'Afternoon Delight', won the directing award at the 2013 Sundance Festival. The critics weren't as kind: on Metacritic, there were 4 negative reviews, 10 mixed and only 7 positive. The film is really a dramedy, but more comedy than serious drama. Kathryn Hahn plays 'Rachel', a bored housewife in suburbia who is no longer having sex with her yuppie husband, Jeff.Rachel is presented as a ditsy do-gooder who decides to drag her husband along to a strip-club in the hopes that this might spice up their sex life. There, Rachel gets a lap dance from the stripper, McKenna, and later seeks her out on the streets, where she offers to put her up at her home, if, in exchange, McKenna works part-time, as a nanny to her young son. Soon Rachel learns that McKenna is more than a stripper-- she's a high end prostitute.This is the premise of the film and it strains one's credulity that Rachel would actually even entertain the notion of putting up a prostitute in her house, a person who could end up harming her child. But Soloway is playing for laughs here--Rachel is a caricature of a do-gooder and Jeff is a passive schlub (the part of Jeff is particularly underdeveloped--he's someone we really never get to know at all).Soloway gets serious in the second half of the film, contrasting McKenna's lurid lifestyle with Rachel and Jeff's need to restore the sanctity of their marriage. At one point, Rachel freely accompanies McKenna to see one of her long-term clients--and soon realizes it was a big mistake to come along, as she ends up sitting in the bedroom, watching the prostitute and her trick, make love.In real life, McKenna may have ended up creating a lot more problems for the men she encounters, but here, the wily prostitute gets Jeff and his friends drunk at a poker game, and pulls one of the men into a room and has sex with him. There's some damage when the man's wife finds him with McKenna and makes it clear that their marriage is over.McKenna almost succeeds in also ruining Jeff and Rachel's marriage, after he finally tells Rachel what a bad idea it was to let her stay with them (one wonders why Jeff didn't put his foot down from the get-go). Sure enough, Rachel realizes the error of her ways, begs forgiveness from her husband and their relationship is restored (as illustrated by the passionate lovemaking they engage in, at film's end).While the overall story makes little sense, 'Afternoon Delight' has a few scenes here and there that will keep your interest. Particularly good is the interchange between Rachel and her lesbian therapist (in the end, Rachel must console the therapist, who realizes that she had taken her own relationship, for granted). There is also some frank sex talk throughout the film between the housewives, which at least gives the film a modicum of verisimilitude.Often 'Afternoon Delight', has a sitcomish flavor.
