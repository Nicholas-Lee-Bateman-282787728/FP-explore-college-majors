It provided for great building suspense as these people stuck in paradise with a bunch of mans best friends gone totally wild and blood thirsty canines left by visiting insensitive tourists eating and attacking the living and they cant get off the island. ridiculous yes but if there was a boat and they got off the island there wouldnt be a movie. For me there's a couple scenes that to this day disturb me a bit. a scene where a transients normal dog gets totally attacked by a pack of other crazy hounds. the scene looked sooo realistic. these were really well trained dogs. Another is a scene on a pier when joe don baker, in slow motion, backs up his jeep running over the crazy hounds that have surrounded him. i kept saying its only a movie. well do check out this tense little flick cuz it still holds up very well to this day.",4,pack-tatious,1321747200,"11 20, 2011",2011,1123,"['was', 'CUJO', 'MANS', 'BEST', 'FRIEND', 'ANIMALS', 'ON', 'THE', 'LOOSE', 'films', '70s', 'i.e', 'GRIZZLY', 'DAY', 'THE', 'ANIMALS', 'taco', 'bell', 'dog', 'there', 'was', 'classic', 'dogs', 'hell', 'film', 'done', 'way', 'better', 'big', 'kudos', 'director', 'Robert', 'Clouse', 'setting', 'story', 'island', 'provided', 'great', 'building', 'suspense', 'people', 'stuck', 'paradise', 'bunch', 'mans', 'best', 'friends', 'gone', 'totally', 'wild', 'blood', 'thirsty', 'canines', 'left', 'visiting', 'insensitive', 'tourists', 'eating', 'attacking', 'living', 'cant', 'get', 'off', 'island', 'ridiculous', 'yes', 'was', 'boat', 'got', 'off', 'island', 'wouldnt', 'be', 'movie', 'couple', 'day', 'disturb', 'bit', 'scene', 'where', 'transients', 'normal', 'dog', 'totally', 'attacked', 'pack', 'other', 'crazy', 'hounds', 'scene', 'looked', 'sooo', 'realistic', 'were', 'really', 'well', 'trained', 'dogs', 'scene', 'pier', 'when', 'joe', 'don', 'baker', 'slow', 'motion', 'up', 'jeep', 'running', 'crazy', 'hounds', 'have', 'surrounded', 'i', 'kept', 'saying', 'only', 'movie', 'well', 'do', 'check', 'out', 'tense', 'little', 'flick', 'cuz', 'still', 'up', 'very', 'well', 'day']",The Pack VHS

Then when I saw this movie I realized that Cujo isn't the only one. This movie needs to be put on DVD. While it has some cliche moments like knowing the next attack and the whole house burning thing to stop the dogs has been done. What makes this movie stand out is that although fiction it shows that dogs can turn on people when abused or abandoned.The leader of a pack a Lab mix really gives a good performance he is scary I'll admit! And the little collie mix that learns how to unstuck his rope was awesome. Very good dogs with excellent trainers.Please give this movie a chance.,5,This film needs recognition,1203552000,"02 21, 2008",2008,662,"['always', 'thought', 'Cujo', 'was', 'only', 'dog-goes-beserk', 'flick', 'gave', 'chills', 'Then', 'when', 'saw', 'movie', 'realized', 'Cujo', ""n't"", 'only', 'one', 'movie', 'be', 'put', 'DVD', 'cliche', 'moments', 'knowing', 'next', 'attack', 'whole', 'house', 'burning', 'thing', 'stop', 'dogs', 'been', 'done', 'What', 'movie', 'stand', 'out', 'fiction', 'dogs', 'can', 'turn', 'people', 'when', 'abused', 'abandoned.The', 'leader', 'pack', 'Lab', 'mix', 'really', 'good', 'performance', 'scary', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'little', 'collie', 'mix', 'how', 'unstuck', 'rope', 'was', 'awesome', 'Very', 'good', 'dogs', 'excellent', 'trainers.Please', 'give', 'movie', 'chance']",The Pack VHS

I did like the set-up at first, but the movie is too involved in animal cruelty and exploitation for my taste. I think the movie &#34;White Dog&#34; goes much further in exploring issues of animal ethics than this dreck does. These poor dogs are starving because of human idiocy, so I didn't think the ending was just with them getting burned to death in the boat house. The final image is touching, but I found the simple-minded pull towards a &#34;Jaws&#34;-feel to be silly. This was a potentially powerful story spoiled by much overdoing of the hostile situations. Joe Don Baker is a reliable actor, a Charles Bronson-type of sorts, who is very good in smaller supporting roles even (&#34;Cape Fear,&#34; no?). I am an animal lover, so some of this was tough to watch, even though I wanted to like the message of the story.The Warner Archive presentation is clean, with good picture and quality sound, but overall, the picture just isn't essential. I was happy to see all of these rare titles coming out again, but until we see &#34;The Boy who Cried Werewolf&#34; on special edition archive DVD, I won't be going through the roof over these reissues.

As usual, humans are making life easier on themselves by getting rid of the minor responsibility of keeping a dog. This time poor dogs are getting ditched on a small island as families relocate to the mainland. By no fault of their own and with no food, they start attacking livestock and people as they rampage through the countryside. Warnings are not followed and true to life, ignorant people dominate this film and Joe don is the only one with enough sense in his head to be a survivor. Although not an action film, Joe Don carries the film on his capable shoulders facing danger as desperate, neglected, and crazed dogs lurk in the shadows. The ending does justice to man's best friend by showing not all of them were man eaters.
