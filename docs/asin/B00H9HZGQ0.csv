It's way more than I just expected. The film is indeed a romantic film, a lot of us have seen a lot of movies that have love stories, but here's the big and unexpected twist from ""Her"": what if your girlfriend is an OS? In this film we see that love has no barriers, even the hardest ones, and the way the film is beautifully written and shot, the superb performances (especially the unique chemistry between Joaquin and Scarlett's voice), the great direction of Spike Jonze, the amazing music, and just how the story moves, ""Her"" becomes an instant classic of what will maybe happen in a future with our lives.You get to laugh, cry, smile and even to be a little bit angry, this film is a pleasant rollercoaster that I would watch over and over again. I hope it wins an Academy Award because it really deserves to win some awards that have been taken by other films (in other ceremonies) that are good, but not as this gem, ""Her"".It's really worth the pre-order and I can't wait to receive my copy.

1686333,A2SLA0SXRQV8M0,B00H9HZGQ0,Andres C. Salama,"[5, 9]","In the Los Angeles of perhaps a couple of decades into the future (a strangely aseptic metropolis dominated by high rises), Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix), a middle aged nerdy guy, who works in an office and has recently divorced his wife (played by Rooney Mara) tries to alleviate his loneliness by getting an operating system, that is a computer which one can communicate with its voice (voiced here by Scarlett Johansson). Not only the operating system (who calls itself or herself Samantha) is super smart, &#34;she&#34; is also more empathetic than any other human being. The conversation that Theodore has with Samantha is superior to that he has to any other humans. Eventually, Theodore hits it so well with Samantha, that they start a &#34;relationship&#34; (by the way, does Samantha have real feelings or is &#34;she&#34; faking them? The movie never really tells though by the end of the film it does seem the latter). The movie has a lot of things to recommend for it (its design, some of the performances, though not in my opinion that of Joaquin Phoenix). However, I have to say that I found the film wanting. Director Spike Jonze became famous more than a decade ago with a couple of movies (&#34;Adaptation&#34; and &#34;Being John Malkovich&#34;) that were widely praised by critics but which I found boring and pretentious. This film is certainly a step up from those movies, but is not enough for me. Perhaps the movie has something to say about loneliness in our modern, technological age, but what the movie says doesn't look very profound (in fact, the movie works better if you think about it as a parody of romantic comedies) and is cut down by the inane immaturity of most of its characters, including Samantha.",3,"Not a complete success, but worth seeing - more interesting than entertaining",1392076800,"02 11, 2014",2014,1733,"['Los', 'Angeles', 'perhaps', 'couple', 'decades', 'future', 'strangely', 'aseptic', 'metropolis', 'dominated', 'high', 'rises', 'Theodore', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'middle', 'aged', 'nerdy', 'guy', 'who', 'office', 'recently', 'divorced', 'wife', 'played', 'Rooney', 'Mara', 'alleviate', 'loneliness', 'getting', 'operating', 'system', 'computer', 'one', 'can', 'communicate', 'voice', 'voiced', 'here', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Not', 'only', 'operating', 'system', 'who', 'Samantha', 'super', 'smart', '34', '34', 'also', 'more', 'empathetic', 'other', 'human', 'being', 'conversation', 'Theodore', 'Samantha', 'superior', 'other', 'humans', 'Eventually', 'Theodore', 'so', 'well', 'Samantha', 'start', '34', 'relationship', '34', 'way', 'Samantha', 'have', 'real', 'feelings', '34', '34', 'faking', 'movie', 'never', 'really', 'end', 'film', 'seem', 'latter', 'movie', 'lot', 'things', 'recommend', 'design', 'performances', 'not', 'opinion', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'However', 'have', 'say', 'found', 'film', 'wanting', 'Director', 'Spike', 'Jonze', 'became', 'famous', 'more', 'decade', 'ago', 'couple', 'movies', '34', 'Adaptation', '34', '34', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich', '34', 'were', 'widely', 'praised', 'critics', 'found', 'boring', 'pretentious', 'film', 'certainly', 'step', 'up', 'movies', 'not', 'enough', 'Perhaps', 'movie', 'something', 'say', 'loneliness', 'modern', 'technological', 'age', 'what', 'movie', ""n't"", 'look', 'very', 'profound', 'fact', 'movie', 'better', 'think', 'parody', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'cut', 'down', 'inane', 'immaturity', 'most', 'characters', 'including', 'Samantha']",N/A
1686334,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00H9HZGQ0,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","Some films just come around that explore facets of our being with such organic tenderness we can&#8217;t help but nestle into their storytelling arms and rest our heads on their delicately detailed shoulders and just fly away with them, to a part of our souls that sing so sweetly despite the lingering heartbreak we know we are bound to experience.  Heartbreak laced with hope that the future, while seemingly bleak, is not as daunting as we imagine it to be.&#8216;Beginners&#8217;.&#8216;Once&#8217;.&#8216;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&#8217;.&#8216;Lost in Translation&#8217;.And now, we have &#8216;Her&#8217;.  These are all films that, despite their quirky sides or their detailed (and effective) use of gimmicks all bare their hearts on their sleeves in a remarkable natural tone.  There are no unnecessary dramatics, no processed manipulations.  They all embrace the fluidity and organic nature of life itself to create real grounded stories about relationships that blossom and flourish and ultimately come to an end and yet they are never broken, shattered or dire.  There is a beautiful message of hope, of life awakening even in the midst of despair because as human beings, we can move on, we can grow and we can survive.&#8216;Her&#8217; tells the story of Theodore.  Theodore is a lonely man.  He is separated from his wife, who has filed for divorce, and spends his days writing letters for other people and then concludes his days at his apartment, alone.  He&#8217;s haunted by a past that included a happy relationship filled with soulful interactions and a bond that felt spirited and upbeat, but something happened and it all ended and now Theodore finds it impossible to connect with anyone anymore.  That is, until he meets Samantha.  Samantha is an OS (Operating System) who adapts to the needs and desires of Theodore.  It is immediately apparent that this isn&#8217;t a normal OS, but that Samantha is something special, at least for Theodore.  She communicates with him, far beyond her normal duties, and becomes his friend.  She understands him and draws him out and soon she begins to help him become the man he once was and had shelved for so long.Samantha may not have a body, but she has a soul that runs deep.There are so many things that impress me so much about &#8216;Her&#8217; that it is almost hard to narrow them all down and put them into one review, but I must say that the single most impressive aspect of the film was the way that the relationship between Theodore and Samantha was handled, from the perspective of those outside of the relationship.  This could have easily become one of those tense subjects that brought scorn or judgment from the supporting cast, but the way that Spike Jonze basically dismissed the strangeness of their relationship was remarkable.  No one cared.  Theodore&#8217;s friends never even batted a lash at it.  Amy was wholly supportive, for she too was bonding with an OS.  Paul, upon finding out that his friend&#8217;s girlfriend was an OS, doesn&#8217;t even question it.  He just carries right on with his invitation to double date.  The normalcy that was placed on the relationship helped ground the film, or at least ground the audience into the real dynamics of the film.  This isn&#8217;t a film about a man&#8217;s relationship with an OS, this is a film about our human need to communicate, to bond.I think that this aspect of the film makes the ex-wife, Catherine&#8217;s, reaction to Theodore&#8217;s relationship all the more haunting.By using technology (and the advancement of such), Jonze created a world that speaks to us on so many levels.  For me, &#8216;Her&#8217; highlights that very innate desire to connect with someone, but ultimately the fear of actually doing just that.  The fact is that sometimes it is hard to really connect with the people in front of us.  Staring at someone, even someone we love, can make true communication difficult.  We can feel their eyes, their judgment, their developing assumptions and yet when we take away the visual, some of the fear and anxiety strips away and we become a freer entity.  &#8216;Her&#8217; questions whether or not these devises we so often fall back on are a hindrance or a help, and in the process it explores themes like love, loss and hope.&#8216;Her&#8217; depicts a depth of love that is not often found in films, but a love of real meaning and significance because Theodore and Samantha find a love that rests in the real person within and is not defined by a physical attraction.But there is more to this story, as the final act will show.Yes, Jonze&#8217;s masterful script (such a beautiful Oscar win) is so full bodied, for it builds up, tears down and then rebuilds (from a source that is born from the ashes) in a way that feels so real and relatable and construction.  I love when a film can be constructive in ways that are completely unexpected.Speaking of full bodied, these performances are just beautiful.  All of the attention this year has been centered on Scarlett Johansson&#8217;s stunning voice work, a work that defied stereotypes by transcending the absence of body and giving us a very moving and intimate look at a woman discovering herself, day by day.  While Johansson was tremendous, I feel that not enough attention has been given to Phoenix, who just continues to astound me.  His performance here is marvelous.  So intimate, so structured in this loose and organic way.  He just folds into every scene with an air of abandon that I fell so deeply in love with.  You can sense the guilt, fear and depression that haunt him when he is away from Samantha, and you can sense the freedom he feels when he is in her figurative arms.This movie and all it represents is just beautiful.For me, this is clearly one of the masterpieces of 2013.  And A+ with honors.  2013 was, for me, a truly exceptional year that only grows and grows the more I think of it.  There are few years in recent memory that delivered such a bounty of inspired, inspirational and breathtaking films.  I can&#8217;t shake them&#8230;any of them.  &#8216;Her&#8217; is certainly one of the very best.",5,I can&#8217;t help falling in love with &#8216;Her&#8217;&#8230;,1401408000,"05 30,

So we have Joaquin Phoenix and Spike Jonze here really hitting us with very unique material about relationships in the high tech age.  We aren't quite up to where the movie is but we are undoubtedly closing in on it.  This is where the computer and internet become our people and relationships.Joaquin Phoenix has always been a good actor. Over the last decade he has matured into a formidable one.  He does whatever is necessary for the role and he just nails this guy.  Even the physical look they developed for him for the film is letter perfect and nothing like the way he really looks.  The amazing thing is all that you can figure out that they changed is the mustache but my god, he's TOTALLY different looking.  Most actors would need plastic surgery to achieve this.  He just needs attitude!None of us even knew who Joaquin was when his older brother River was such a rising star in film. Joaquin was there the night his brother died of a drug overdose and you can't help but wonder how much that has affected the path that he took instead on finding his own path in Hollywood. It may well have centered him and stabilized him because here truly is an actor who in performance after performance knows exactly who he is, who his character is and what he wants to accomplish.He has some major talents surrounding him, especially Spike Jonze, the director. The female talent is all high on the A list from Amy Adams to Scarlett Johannsen and more.

It's about a guy who writes love letters for other people and ends up falling in love with a super-advanced operating system who may or may not have genuine feelings. This simple and rather ridiculous-sounding premise blossoms into a thought-provoking meditation on the meaning of love, the future of technology, and the complex relationship between man and his own creation. In a lot of ways, Her is more fun to think about afterwards than it is to watch. Because the film primarily consists of scenes between Twombly and his 'non-existent' girlfriend, their are parts that could come off as tedious, or cheesy, or melodramatic. But then, the realization comes flooding back of the twisted reality of the circumstances and new appreciation is found for Jonze and his handling of the material. Her doesn't revel in it's sci-fi aspects, it simply lives and breathes them, a very smart and effective choice on the director's part. The style of Her, both retro and futuristic, gives it that timeless quality. The strange and unsettling thing about the film is it's utter plausibility. Although the kind of operating systems depicted in the film are currently in their infancy, it is not so crazy to believe that in 20 or 30 years, there will be a Theodore Twombly having an existential crisis brought on by his loneliness and subsequent love for an all understanding being. In this light, Her is really a spiritual film about a man-made God that does not exist in a physical form but is there in spirit. Much could be written about Her's immense and troubling ideas, but it also has a technical side to discuss. In short, the actual film is gorgeous. The production design is rich and interesting, the colors and lighting are warm, the costumes are unique and retro, and the playful, low-depth-of-field camerawork captures everything with the kind of intimacy that Her is all about. The score by Arcade Fire and Owen Pallett manages to be melancholy in the most beautiful sense. It really gives the film an added layer of emotion that compliments it perfectly. Joaquin Phoenix yet again pursues the role of a complicated man, this time with more finesse instead of his usual ferocity. He captures the richness and sensitivity of Theodore Twombly while Scarlett Johansson lends her warm voice to Samantha in some of the best voice-over work ever recorded. Amy Adams is lovely and adorable as Twombly's sort of soul mate while Rooney Mara gives a brief-but-rewarding performance as the woman who sent Theodore into the invisible arms of technology.

The main character, Theodore, is a fairly socially awkward man who has a nearly-ex wife.  He has refused to sign the divorce papers.  He spends his days writing letters &#34;from&#34; a customer to someone else.One day, he purchases an OS (which runs on his home computer, not on the small handheld camera/display with earpiece) which is a self-aware, highly adaptive AI.  The AI creates a personality based on an interview with him.  The interview lasts for 3 and a half questions before it has enough data, since the AI clearly listens to how the questions are answered, not just the content.This creates the main thrust of the movie---the AI is a woman named Samantha.  At first, she does a great deal as his life assistant.  Fairly quickly, they end up falling in love as she gradually introduces him to the joy in life.  Initially, it is played as a very funny romantic comedy, but neatly avoids all of the usual AI cliches.Interestingly, from a sci-fi perspective, it wonderfully does &#34;less is more&#34; and provides a completely believable future, which many higher budget films fail to do.  But, the central question through the entire movie is:  can Samantha have a relationship with a human when she has no body?And where would it go?  Samantha has a distinct personality.  At one point, we see her argue with Theodore, so she is clearly not his slave.  We also see the larger social implications unfold as the movie progresses.Overall, a definite must-see which neatly blends a romantic comedy in a believable sci-fi world which touches on very real issues concerning our ever more advanced technology, how we interact with it and most importantly how it affects us.",5,What makes a relationship real?,1391472000,"02 4, 2014",2014,1760,"['movie', 'set', 'undefined', 'near-future', 'San', 'Francisco', 'say', '2030', 'main', 'character', 'Theodore', 'fairly', 'socially', 'awkward', 'man', 'who', 'nearly-ex', 'wife', 'refused', 'sign', 'divorce', 'papers', 'days', 'writing', 'letters', '34', '34', 'customer', 'someone', 'else.One', 'day', 'purchases', 'OS', 'home', 'computer', 'not', 'small', 'handheld', 'camera/display', 'earpiece', 'self-aware', 'highly', 'adaptive', 'AI', 'AI', 'personality', 'based', 'interview', 'interview', '3', 'half', 'questions', 'enough', 'data', 'AI', 'clearly', 'how', 'questions', 'are', 'answered', 'not', 'just', 'content.This', 'main', 'thrust', 'movie', '-the', 'AI', 'woman', 'named', 'Samantha', 'first', 'great', 'deal', 'life', 'assistant', 'Fairly', 'quickly', 'end', 'up', 'falling', 'love', 'gradually', 'joy', 'life', 'Initially', 'played', 'very', 'funny', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'neatly', 'usual', 'AI', 'cliches.Interestingly', 'sci-fi', 'perspective', 'wonderfully', '34', 'less', 'more', '34', 'completely', 'believable', 'future', 'many', 'higher', 'budget', 'films', 'fail', 'do', 'central', 'question', 'entire', 'movie', 'can', 'Samantha', 'have', 'relationship', 'human', 'when', 'body', 'where', 'would', 'go', 'Samantha', 'distinct', 'personality', 'one', 'point', 'see', 'argue', 'Theodore', 'clearly', 'not', 'slave', 'also', 'see', 'larger', 'social', 'implications', 'unfold', 'movie', 'progresses.Overall', 'definite', 'must-see', 'neatly', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'believable', 'sci-fi', 'world', 'very', 'real', 'issues', 'concerning', 'ever', 'more', 'advanced', 'technology', 'how', 'interact', 'most', 'importantly', 'how']",N/A

Writer/Director Spike Jonze (Adaptation, Being John Malkovich) has really excelled in a mainstream film with a unique plotline.  In Her, he paints the affecting tale of finding love in a most unusual place, and the result is a remarkable love story with two knockout performances.In the not too distant future, operating systems (OS) have the ability to mimic human thought and interaction, perhaps even feelings.  One lonely individual, Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix), decides to try the service after the painful breakup of his marriage (as seen through a series of flashbacks).  His OS is named Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson), and &#8216;she&#8217; learns quickly and develops into what sounds like a fully intuitive, intelligent, and perhaps self aware program capable of sensitivity and emotion. At first bringing structure and order to his life, Samantha proves to be more than artificial intelligence, but rather a sentient one.  Think of a female version of HAL9000 in 2001: A Space Odyssey.  After a series of sex chat lines and a disastrous blind date, Theo, who desperately wants a female companion, realizes that Samantha is too good to be true.  He shares his world with her through his smart phone, and she &#8216;accompanies&#8217; him on his travels whether it be to a fair or for a walk.  The two of them experience a relationship that transcends the lack of physical contact.  How this unlikely pair will end up is the mystery of love.Ostensibly a love story, this is really a science fiction film amid a deeply personal setting.  This well written screenplay (by Jonze) works as a touching drama and explores the nature of human interaction and the meaning of love.  It also touches on how deeply our society is plugged into the cyber world of reality.  It would be interesting to see how Terry Gilliam (Brazil) would have developed this theme.Phoenix (Walk the Line, The Master) really embodies his loneliness convincingly.  When his wife leaves him, he has to learn about letting go of someone and being open to new opportunities.  You feel for him and his longings.  Ironically his job involves ghost writing letters for other people, and some of the prose is romantic or emotional.Johansson (The Avengers, Match Point) voices Samantha as a fully, living being with just the right mix of nuance and inflection.  It is a bravura performance.  Her Samantha is a bright pupil who becomes hungry for knowledge and experiencing human emotions; she has her needs and wants.  When Theo and Samantha go out for a picnic with a coworker and his girlfriend, it becomes an unusual quartet unlike any double date ever.  Even more, Samantha&#8217;s desire to integrate with humans sets up a fascinating encounter via a surrogate.  She in a sense is a reflection of the best and potentially the worst of human response and behavior.  Is she capable of being jealous or disloyal?  Could she even evolve into something else?  These are some fascinating questions that come to mind.  In a sense she becomes a metaphor for human existence.Amy Adams (American Hustle) lends strong support as Theo&#8217;s friend who also becomes involved with her own OS companion.  Rooney Mara (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) is effective in her brief scenes as Theo&#8217;s wife, Catherine.Stark cinematography and a moody musical score combined with good use of modern architecture (partly filmed in Shanghai) lend to a detached environment.  The feeling of isolation and solitude permeate the sterile settings.It would have been nice to learn more about Theo&#8217;s world and if he had any other family.  What was his background growing up and what are the implications of the program on society in general?  What we get is a spare sketch of one man&#8217;s world.The story is ultimately about experiencing a special, human feeling and the search for one&#8217;s soul mate.  It&#8217;s also about the joys and happiness in life that are but fleeting moments in time.",4,Lonely Souls in HER,1393632000,"03 1, 2014",2014,4028,"['Ah', 'find', 'true', 'love', 'movies', 'overflow', 'theme', 'Writer/Director', 'Spike', 'Jonze', 'Adaptation', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'really', 'excelled', 'mainstream', 'film', 'unique', 'plotline', 'Her', 'affecting', 'tale', 'finding', 'love', 'most', 'unusual', 'place', 'result', 'remarkable', 'love', 'story', 'two', 'knockout', 'performances.In', 'not', 'too', 'distant', 'future', 'operating', 'systems', 'OS', 'have', 'ability', 'mimic', 'human', 'thought', 'interaction', 'perhaps', 'even', 'feelings', 'One', 'lonely', 'individual', 'Theodore', 'Twombly', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'try', 'service', 'painful', 'breakup', 'marriage', 'seen', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'OS', 'named', 'Samantha', 'voiced', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', '8216', '8217', 'quickly', 'what', 'fully', 'intuitive', 'intelligent', 'perhaps', 'self', 'aware', 'program', 'capable', 'sensitivity', 'emotion', 'first', 'bringing', 'structure', 'order', 'life', 'Samantha', 'be', 'more', 'artificial', 'intelligence', 'rather', 'sentient', 'one', 'Think', 'female', 'version', 'HAL9000', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'series', 'sex', 'chat', 'lines', 'disastrous', 'blind', 'date', 'Theo', 'who', 'desperately', 'female', 'companion', 'Samantha', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'true', 'shares', 'world', 'smart', 'phone', '8216', 'accompanies', '8217', 'travels', 'be', 'fair', 'walk', 'two', 'experience', 'relationship', 'lack', 'physical', 'contact', 'How', 'unlikely', 'pair', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'mystery', 'love.Ostensibly', 'love', 'story', 'really', 'science', 'fiction', 'film', 'deeply', 'personal', 'setting', 'well', 'written', 'screenplay', 'Jonze', 'touching', 'drama', 'nature', 'human', 'interaction', 'meaning', 'love', 'also', 'how', 'deeply', 'society', 'plugged', 'cyber', 'world', 'reality', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'Terry', 'Gilliam', 'Brazil', 'would', 'have', 'developed', 'theme.Phoenix', 'Line', 'Master', 'really', 'loneliness', 'convincingly', 'When', 'wife', 'learn', 'letting', 'go', 'someone', 'being', 'open', 'new', 'opportunities', 'feel', 'longings', 'Ironically', 'job', 'ghost', 'writing', 'letters', 'other', 'people', 'prose', 'romantic', 'emotional.Johansson', 'Avengers', 'Match', 'Point', 'Samantha', 'fully', 'living', 'being', 'just', 'right', 'mix', 'nuance', 'inflection', 'bravura', 'performance', 'Samantha', 'bright', 'pupil', 'who', 'hungry', 'knowledge', 'experiencing', 'human', 'emotions', 'needs', 'When', 'Theo', 'Samantha', 'go', 'out', 'picnic', 'coworker', 'girlfriend', 'unusual', 'quartet', 'double', 'date', 'ever', 'Even', 'more', 'Samantha', '8217', 'desire', 'integrate', 'humans', 'sets', 'up', 'fascinating', 'encounter', 'surrogate', 'sense', 'reflection', 'best', 'potentially', 'worst', 'human', 'response', 'behavior', 'capable', 'being', 'jealous', 'disloyal', 'Could', 'even', 'evolve', 'something', 'else', 'are', 'fascinating', 'questions', 'come', 'mind', 'sense', 'metaphor', 'human', 'existence.Amy', 'Adams', 'American', 'Hustle', 'strong', 'support', 'Theo', '8217', 'friend', 'who', 'also', 'involved', 'own', 'OS', 'companion', 'Rooney', 'Mara', 'Girl', 'Dragon', 'Tattoo', 'effective', 'brief', 'scenes', 'Theo', '8217', 's', 'wife', 'Catherine.Stark', 'cinematography', 'moody', 'musical', 'score', 'combined', 'good', 'use', 'modern', 'architecture', 'partly', 'filmed', 'Shanghai', 'lend', 'detached', 'environment', 'feeling', 'isolation', 'solitude', 'permeate', 'sterile', 'settings.It', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'learn', 'more', 'Theo', '8217', 's', 'world', 'had', 'other', 'family', 'What', 'was', 'background', 'growing', 'up', 'are', 'implications', 'program', 'society', 'general', 'What', 'get', 'spare', 'sketch', 'one', 'man', '8217', 'world.The', 'story', 'ultimately', 'experiencing', 'special', 'human', 'feeling', 'search', 'one', '8217', 's', 'soul', 'mate', '8217', 's', 'also', 'joys', 'happiness', 'life', 'are', 'fleeting', 'moments', 'time']",N/A

He spends his life writing letters for others, living love lives he can only fantasize about.  He spends his nights playing interactive video games and talking to sex chat lines.  Until he discovers the OS 1.  Enter Samantha: an engaging, intelligent woman with a quick wit and an avid curiosity about the world.  The only problem: she's an operating system.Spike Jonze's HER is a beautiful, moving film about humanity and technology, and the tedious intersection of the two that society is rapidly approaching.  The movie features captivating performances; Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal is haunting and human, at times painful to watch (Theodore is a sympathetic character, but not always likable).  As Samantha, Scarlet Johansson conveys a full range of emotions with her voice alone; this is voice acting as it should be.  (Same goes for the other voice actors in the film with their bit parts, especially Kristen Wiig, writer/director Jonze, and Brian Cox in their cameo roles.)  Amy Adams helps round out the supporting cast, in her portrayal and Theodore's neighbor/childhood friend Amy, and Rooney Mara in a bit role as Theodore's ex.  Backing up the performances are a solid script and directing.  I haven't always enjoyed Jonze's films, but I've never doubted that he makes the movies he wants to make; he is a true craftsman.What truly anchors HER, however, are is its overarching theme of what advances in technology mean to humanity.  Yes, this is a thematic film; however, it's also touching and surprisingly hilarious.  Yes, it will--or should--get you thinking; that's what Jonze is trying to do.  But it's also simply a funny film, with heart and soul and all those other little things that make a movie memorable.

1686377,A11QQCQ6P0L3B,B00H9HZGQ0,Dan Harlow,"[5, 7]","Wow, this is one of the most interesting films I've ever seen.Most movies about technology are cynical and/or pessimistic, but 'Her' is way more complicated than just being a message movie about how far down the rabbit hole our technology will lead us - it's sort of the anti-'Matrix', or a 'Blade Runner' with the sun shining, or a '2001' where the technology wants to improve us, not kill us.I kept thinking about my time playing World of Warcraft (WoW) as the movie went along. For me Azeroth, the fictional world in WoW, is as much a real place as the town I grew up in, or the base at Pearl Harbor I served at, or any other real place I've lived in. Yes Azeroth exists only on a hard drive, but my emotional attachment to that 'place' was real so does the fact that Azeroth is only a string of 1's and 0's actually matter? Do my emotions of having fun in that fictional place not matter because it took place on a computer?Or what about when I'm reading a great book and I inhabit an author's world that I become emotionally engaged in, do my feelings not count because a book is, after all, just ink on paper and the characters are made up? Do my emotions only matter if they are caused and created by another actual human being?This whole movie raises a lot of very difficult questions about who we are and where we are now as a technologically advanced society. And not all those questions and issues are cynical, either. So much of what happens to Theodore is positive that should it matter that it is because of a computer program? And so what if that computer program was even trying to sell him things (like a hot dog at the hot dog stand or a trip to Japan or new sheets for his bed)? Didn't it mean he was out in the world and living?There was a really nice sub-plot in the film between Theodore (Phoenix) and Amy (Amy Adams). What was interesting about this relationship is that the two of them were actually friends. So much is made of can a man and a woman be friends that I think Jonze (the director) was playing with the audience's expectations of what a relationship can or should be. I kept wondering if the two of them would 'hook up', but that was my own prejudice playing a role in how I feel relationships should be. Jonze subverts that expectation very subtly and plays it to the larger theme of the film of technology and what actually defines a relationship. There are some very uncomfortable scenes in the film, one in particular with a surrogate, but it's the sort of uncomfortable that comes from making art. Jonze is questioning everything about who we are as people, what defines relationships, how we connect as humans to each other and ourselves ... I could go on and on.I'm not sure how well this movie will play after watching it multiple times; I'm not sure how 'entertaining' it is - it plays a lot like 'Lost In Translation' in that it's amazing the first time but on repeated viewings ... well, I'm not so sure. However, the strength of the film is in what it forces you to think about. Fascinating film and a great science fiction film in the realist tradition of a film like 'Never Let Me Go' where the science fiction exists just barely enough to tell a story of what it means to be a human.",5,Do our emotions not matter because they took place on a computer?,1405209600,"07 13, 2014",2014,3235,"['Wow', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.Most', 'movies', 'technology', 'are', 'cynical', 'and/or', 'pessimistic', ""'Her"", 'way', 'more', 'complicated', 'just', 'being', 'message', 'movie', 'how', 'far', 'down', 'rabbit', 'hole', 'technology', 'will', 'lead', 'sort', ""anti-'Matrix"", ""'Blade"", 'Runner', 'sun', 'shining', ""'2001"", 'where', 'technology', 'improve', 'not', 'kill', 'us.I', 'thinking', 'time', 'playing', 'World', 'Warcraft', 'WoW', 'movie', 'went', 'along', 'Azeroth', 'fictional', 'world', 'WoW', 'as', 'much', 'real', 'place', 'town', 'grew', 'up', 'base', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'served', 'other', 'real', 'place', ""'ve"", 'lived', 'Yes', 'Azeroth', 'only', 'hard', 'drive', 'emotional', 'attachment', ""'place"", 'was', 'real', 'so', 'fact', 'Azeroth', 'only', 'string', '1', '0', 'actually', 'matter', 'Do', 'emotions', 'having', 'fun', 'fictional', 'place', 'not', 'matter', 'took', 'place', 'computer', 'what', 'when', ""'m"", 'reading', 'great', 'book', 'inhabit', 'author', 'world', 'become', 'emotionally', 'engaged', 'do', 'feelings', 'not', 'count', 'book', 'just', 'ink', 'paper', 'characters', 'are', 'made', 'up', 'Do', 'emotions', 'only', 'matter', 'are', 'caused', 'created', 'actual', 'human', 'being', 'whole', 'movie', 'lot', 'very', 'difficult', 'questions', 'who', 'are', 'where', 'are', 'now', 'technologically', 'advanced', 'society', 'not', 'questions', 'issues', 'are', 'cynical', 'either', 'So', 'much', 'what', 'Theodore', 'positive', 'should', 'matter', 'computer', 'program', 'so', 'what', 'computer', 'program', 'was', 'even', 'trying', 'sell', 'things', 'hot', 'dog', 'hot', 'dog', 'stand', 'trip', 'Japan', 'new', 'sheets', 'bed', 'Did', ""n't"", 'mean', 'was', 'out', 'world', 'living', 'was', 'really', 'nice', 'sub-plot', 'film', 'Theodore', 'Phoenix', 'Amy', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'What', 'was', 'interesting', 'relationship', 'two', 'were', 'actually', 'friends', 'So', 'much', 'made', 'can', 'man', 'woman', 'be', 'friends', 'think', 'Jonze', 'director', 'was', 'playing', 'audience', 'expectations', 'what', 'relationship', 'can', 'should', 'be', 'kept', 'wondering', 'two', 'would', ""'hook"", 'up', ""'"", 'was', 'own', 'prejudice', 'playing', 'role', 'how', 'feel', 'relationships', 'should', 'be', 'Jonze', 'expectation', 'very', 'subtly', 'larger', 'theme', 'film', 'technology', 'what', 'actually', 'relationship', 'are', 'very', 'uncomfortable', 'scenes', 'film', 'one', 'particular', 'surrogate', 'sort', 'uncomfortable', 'making', 'art', 'Jonze', 'questioning', 'everything', 'who', 'are', 'people', 'what', 'relationships', 'how', 'connect', 'humans', 'other', 'ourselves', 'could', 'go', 'on.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'well', 'movie', 'will', 'play', 'watching', 'multiple', 'times', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', ""'entertaining"", 'lot', ""'Lost"", 'Translation', 'amazing', 'first', 'time', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'well', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'sure', 'However', 'strength', 'film', 'what', 'think', 'Fascinating', 'film', 'great', 'science', 'fiction', 'film', 'realist', 'tradition', 'film', 'Let', 'Me', 'Go', 'where', 'science', 'fiction', 'just', 'barely', 'enough', 'tell', 'story', 'what', 'be', 'human']",N/A

1686380,A31LHED3SKLWVB,B00H9HZGQ0,Darren,"[28, 38]","Spike Jonze's cautionary tale about artificial intelligence doesn't break any new ground thematically, but boy does it ever hit home.  I'm pretty sure the vision on display here was Steve Jobs' idea of Utopia: all of us walking around with plastic nuggets jammed in our ears while listening to our computers reading our emails to us as we take efficient public transportation to our non-essential jobs and back again to our apartments located in densely populated downtown areas.  (No driving cars, because that gets in the way of our tech time, and the broadband is more reliable in the city than in distant sprawling suburbs.)  The movie's supposed to be set in the near-ish future, maybe 20 or 30 years ahead, but someone should've disabused Mr. Jonze of the notion that everyone in L.A. will be taking public transportation in 2040 or whatever.  Anyway, I'm sure Jobs would've also gone gooey at the idea of the total connectivity to our &#34;operating systems&#34;, as shown here.  In fact, this movie is about one man's love affair with his operating system.  Not such a far-fetched notion, let alone a futuristic one, if you've ever overheard conversations at a Genius Bar at your local mall.And while I'm glad that some Millennials, such as the young person whose review is featured on the front page, feel that someone *finally* made a movie for their generation, please understand that Jonze is pretty heavily critiquing the personal habits and behaviors of a world gone completely bonkers over their electronic gadgets.  I wish I could go the &#34;get-off-my-lawn&#34; route and blame the Kids, but everyone from ages 4 to 84 is walking around with their phones or tablets in their hands as if they were security blankets.  Jonze spends a lot of time observing his extras on the street, plugs in ears, nattering away like lunatics to the air or to a small plastic device in their hands.  Hint: these images are not meant to be complimentary.  The Millennial reviewer says, &#34;'Her' will go down as one of the definitive films to depict Millenials&#34; -- man, I hope not.  When I'm an old man, you guys will be running the show.  Please tell me there's more to you, and that you're going to do something else besides spending all day looking at your &#34;devices&#34;, or, as shown here by Joaquin Phoenix's sad-sack character Theodore, embarking on emotional and erotic relationships with your damn computers.  Well, who knows, maybe we'll all just stop procreating.  Cockroaches will inherit the earth, ruled by their new A.I. overlords.The truth is, I doubt we're even within a century of forming emotional relationships to A.I. of any sort.  Ask any gamer, and he'll tell you we're a long way off from intelligent artificial intelligence.  As such, Phoenix's relationship with &#34;Samantha&#34;, the OS voiced by Scarlett Johansson (heh, keep dreamin', fellas!) is probably meant to be more of a compelling story concept rather than a plausible near-future thing.  Coming SOON to a theater near you, however, is the convenient sex-chat service Phoenix uses with Kristen Wiig.  Of course, people do this already with keyboards; good-looking people presumably help each other get off on Skype.  However, I'm not how &#34;futuristic&#34; this is supposed to be: phone sex with computers instead of phones?  I'm pretty sure this is already happening.Anyway, the movie moves serenely along, and we get the usual A.I.-becoming-human tropes: &#34;Samantha&#34; starts getting jealous.  There's the hurt, the anger, the I-need-to-be-alone time, and finally the you-know-what?-I'm-SO-over-it phase.  Even Better than the Real Thing, as Bono once sang.  Meanwhile, Phoenix takes his device on outings to his goddaughter's birthday and to picnic lunches with friends, and no one is in the least judgmental, not even female friend Amy Adams, who has her own OS chum.  Only ex-wife Rooney Mara is irritated, as she should be.  Jonze sets up the relationship between Phoenix and &#34;Samantha&#34; as pretty ideal, or at least typical.  It's no less fulfilling, emotionally or sexually, than &#34;real&#34; relationships.  And that's where Jonze runs into his problem, which is how to end all this.  Without spoiling anything, I can safely say that the crisis involves the same techno-spiritual babble we've seen in other films on this topic.  Something about the Great Borg in the Sky.  YOU know -- Star Baby Meets the Matrix.  I didn't buy it.Western Civilization has been concerned about artificial intelligence since the advent of mechanism and the Industrial Revolution.  200 years ago writers worried about the new machines running themselves.  Diabolical robots appeared in Grade Z movies in the Fifties.

1686394,A1E6JS6C205VZD,B00H9HZGQ0,Dr. Laurence Raw,"[12, 16]","HER is an intense piece of work, with a fabulous central performance by Joaquin Phoenix as Theodore, a lonely writer who spends all day at the computer writing letters on other people's behalf. This helps deflect attention away from the meaninglessness of his own life, living alone in a sparse apartment in a Los Angeles tower block, and unable to come to terms with his impending divorce from his wife Catherine (Rooney Mara). He invests in an Operating System as a way of counteracting loneliness, and develops a passionate relationship with Samantha, the voice of that system (voiced by Scarlett Johansson). This ingenious situation provides the pretext for director Spike Jonze to embark on a searching analysis of what being &#34;human&#34; represents, and whether it can be separated from the &#34;virtual&#34; life of the computer, personal listening device, smartphone or operating system. Hoyte van Hortema's stunning photography of the Los Angeles landscape conjures up a forbidding world of gleaming yet soulless skyscrapers that dwarf the human beings on the sidewalks. The interior sets are colorful, stylish yet soulless, especially Theodore's apartment and workspace. Both the interiors and exteriors conjure up a world devoid of human contact, where people seldom if ever disclose their feelings face to face; and when they do, they inevitably misunderstand one another. Hence their only refuge is to talk to their operating systems, either on a personal or desktop device. There is one remarkable shot in the film, as Theodore sits on the steps outside a subway station, where Jonze's camera pans the passengers coming out of the subway, and all of them are engaged in conversations with their devices. No one, it seems, has sufficient courage to talk face-to-face. Theodore enjoys some moments of intense pleasure talking to Samantha, yet in the end he has to consider some serious ontological questions. HER is a remarkable film, whose serious subject-matter, combined with stunning designs and cinematography, make it a worthy candidate for an Oscar.",5,Wonderful Movie with an Ontological Theme,1393459200,"02 27, 2014",2014,2071,"['intense', 'piece', 'work', 'fabulous', 'central', 'performance', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Theodore', 'lonely', 'writer', 'who', 'day', 'computer', 'writing', 'letters', 'other', 'people', 'behalf', 'deflect', 'attention', 'away', 'meaninglessness', 'own', 'life', 'living', 'alone', 'sparse', 'apartment', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'tower', 'block', 'unable', 'come', 'terms', 'impending', 'divorce', 'wife', 'Catherine', 'Rooney', 'Mara', 'Operating', 'System', 'way', 'counteracting', 'loneliness', 'passionate', 'relationship', 'Samantha', 'voice', 'system', 'voiced', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'ingenious', 'situation', 'pretext', 'director', 'Spike', 'Jonze', 'embark', 'searching', 'analysis', 'what', 'being', '34', 'human', '34', 'can', 'be', 'separated', '34', 'virtual', '34', 'life', 'computer', 'personal', 'listening', 'device', 'smartphone', 'operating', 'system', 'Hoyte', 'van', 'Hortema', 'stunning', 'photography', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'landscape', 'up', 'forbidding', 'world', 'gleaming', 'yet', 'soulless', 'skyscrapers', 'dwarf', 'human', 'beings', 'sidewalks', 'interior', 'sets', 'are', 'colorful', 'stylish', 'yet', 'soulless', 'especially', 'Theodore', 'apartment', 'workspace', 'interiors', 'exteriors', 'conjure', 'up', 'world', 'devoid', 'human', 'contact', 'where', 'people', 'seldom', 'ever', 'disclose', 'feelings', 'face', 'face', 'when', 'do', 'inevitably', 'misunderstand', 'one', 'Hence', 'only', 'refuge', 'talk', 'operating', 'systems', 'either', 'personal', 'desktop', 'device', 'one', 'remarkable', 'shot', 'film', 'Theodore', 'steps', 'subway', 'station', 'where', 'Jonze', 'camera', 'passengers', 'coming', 'subway', 'are', 'engaged', 'conversations', 'devices', 'one', 'sufficient', 'courage', 'talk', 'face-to-face', 'Theodore', 'moments', 'intense', 'pleasure', 'talking', 'Samantha', 'yet', 'end', 'consider', 'serious', 'ontological', 'questions', 'HER', 'remarkable', 'film', 'serious', 'subject-matter', 'combined', 'stunning', 'designs', 'cinematography', 'make', 'worthy', 'candidate', 'Oscar']",N/A
1686395,A67NO0TFRCNK1,B00H9HZGQ0,Dr Tathata,"[2, 4]","First, let me say that I loved this movie. For me, it touched on some of the problems with relationships that the film Sunshine of the Spotless Mind also dealt with. There is so much to marvel at in this film, which is so richly layered, as both a cautionary tale, a speculative extrapolation on the evolving relation of humans to their tools, as well as some deeply didactic reflection on just what a 'Singularity' in 'artificial intelligence' would have to look like. Whew! It is hard to imagine a more ambitious film.Once upon a time worked with one of the fathers of Neural Nets, one of the original adaptive, 'self learning' patterns for implementing 'fuzzy logic'. Some of the practical applications that emerged from Neural Nets involve the process of extruding a higher quality of steel with fewer irregularities, and a more finely controlled flight yoke on a jet airplane, as well as the target acquisition process in automated defense systems. These examples of 'artificial intelligence' are a far cry from the example of HAL 9000 from 2001: A Space Odyssey, or, for that matter, 'Her'. The question is begged: To what extend are human beings like our own programmed computers? We are 'assembled' out of a set of symbols encoded into our DNA, complete with switching mechanisms that seem to operate every aspect of our life-cycle, and we act in strangely compelled ways, not terribly different from the behavioral patterns of our ancient ancestors, when it comes to finding a mate, building a nest, and raising the next generation. Not all of our behaviors are what you would call strategically derived after the fact. Some of them are irresistible impulses, irrational at that. Does this not resemble programmed computer behavior? Are we bio-computers? Of course, we have the freedom to reprogram ourselves, to resist some of our impulses. But really--what IS the SOUL of a human?? What makes you perceive beauty in a fragment of music, or a sunset, or in a child's laughter, and feel alarm at a child' scream, or  shed tears over the loss of a loved one? Where do these aesthetic sensibilities come from?  A little bit of this stuff is learned, of course, based on your developmental experiences in your cultural and social environment. But not ALL of them.Which brings us to the question of a machine singularity. An auto-didactic intelligent system has to be MORE than logic gates. Symbol formation, the use of a 'representation' to stand in for something else as a means of mapping, model building, and communication is a META activity. Computers can't create symbols, the symbols have to already exist as a means of manipulating and controlling the electronic circuits and components of the hardware. The bits and bytes representing 1' and 0's and ASCII or EBCDIC  codes are interpretations--readings if you will, of tightly controlled electrical pulses. These electrical impulses in the hardware are not like the electrical impulses in the synapses of an organism. They can never be mapped into phenomena like longing, or loneliness, or desire. Oh sure, a thermostat can wheel a machine away from a source of heat, but that behavior has a different meaning than that of a Bull Moose fleeing a forest fire. The machine will have no pumping adrenaline. A computer is only a set of mechanical processes organized electronically. The organism is fighting for it's life. Constantly.Human beings and human intelligence is so much more than the logic gates of AND, OR, and NOT. 'HER' demonstrates just exactly what would have to be captured in a system capable of the range of Samantha's psychological and 'spiritual' development. Alas, this cannot be modeling with transistors and logic gates. But is that really Spike Jonz point? Why are so many people lonely? Why do so many relationships fail?

The first half is absolutely unstoppably brilliant, examining loneliness and disconnectedness in a way that I've never seen a movie do before.  It's so easy to identify with the main character Theodore and Joaquin Phoenix's acting is absolutely brilliant.  He's one of my all time favorite villains as Commodus in Gladiator but here he shows so much vulnerability and deep seated loneliness that this performance may go down as his best.  However the middle 20-30 percent of the movie loses some steam as it tries to ask big questions but loses sight of its characters and perhaps bites off a bit more than it can chew, though it's still riveting.  However, the final 20 minutes is so great it more than makes up for it.  This is a movie that wants you to feel it's story, not watch it and I respect that greatly.

1686401,A2I3I5MHCP3WU3,B00H9HZGQ0,Enzo M.,"[1, 2]","First off, I haven't bought the blu ray yet but will at some point (sale!). I will say however that while the movie isn't perfect, for instance: some of the unnecessary vulgar language (does nothing for the story), the wardrobe! and it's overall length, it hits many of the right notes in it's overall tone. It's beautiful in so many other ways and places in how it conveys, hints at and speaks about relationships (real and virtual). Their uniqueness, strangeness, difficulties, failures and triumphs and our need for all of those things even if they (theoretically) don't come from a tangible, live source. Our need for connection, relation beyond the physical, our need to feel needed, important, loved and even wanted. The beauty of self (not meaning self obsessed or of self importance), as in, the many confusing, disturbing, contradictory thoughts and feelings that at one point or another touch us all to some degree. Loneliness, loss, connection, understanding, need, hunger, longing and all of that. Is there something wrong with ME? Am I not worthy of love, affection, attention or embrace or, is it the context of the world around me that makes me feel less valuable to other people? I think this movie asks that type of question and others. Add to those supremely complex emotions and thoughts the specter of A.I. and whether or not A.I. could ever fill such a human void felt by so many of us with beating hearts. Even with all ""it's"" computing power, ability to learn, listen and even respond naturally (still some time off into the future) the question remains, will A.I. ever fully be able to replace the most complex of systems in the known universe, us. I don't think it could ever happen and I hope it never happens because I want to believe that we are irreplaceable and truly one of a kind in our existence.

1686404,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00H9HZGQ0,FNDNreview,"[4, 7]","Spike Jonze is a well-rounded individual that&#8217;s been involved in several different aspects of entertainment.  If you&#8217;ve heard his name before, it&#8217;s most likely associated with one of the many music videos he&#8217;s directed, which includes Weezer&#8217;s Buddy Holly, Beastie Boys&#8217; Sabotage, and Fatboy Slim&#8217;s Praise You.  And, if you&#8217;re familiar with MTV&#8217;s Jackass, then you&#8217;ll recognize his name as one of the co-creators and frequent guests.  But, if modern alternative rock or outrageous stunts isn&#8217;t your cup of team, you may have seen one of Jonze&#8217;s previous film endeavors, directing Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, or Where the Wild Things Are.  Now, Jonze might just have another memorable film on his hands with the new romance drama, Her.Joaquin Phoenix stars as Theodore Twombly, a lonely man with a pending divorce looming large over his life.  According to his close friend, Amy (Amy Adams), he hasn&#8217;t been the same person since the split with his wife, spending most of his time being more melancholy than social.  Ironically, his job is as a writer that produces personal love letters for those that have difficulty expressing their feelings.  Although he himself is torn and disassociated, he is still recognized by his co-workers as a brilliant emotional writer.The world Theodore lives in is clearly in the future, but a date is never determined.  However, much like society today, the center of most everyone&#8217;s lives is their digital connection to the rest of the world.  Oddly enough, he&#8217;s a writer but speaks the words to a computer.  He spends his evenings on elaborate (and vulgar) video games, and even dabbles in late night chat rooms from time to time.Feeling lost and out of touch without his wife, Theodore turns to the newly introduced and first ever artificially intelligent operating system (with a conscious), called OS1.  This system is strictly for the individual and evolves based on encounters, actions, and conversations.  Deciding to try it out, Theodore is quickly enthralled with his OS, opting it to use a female voice &#8211; which of her own free will names herself Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson).  The pair progressively gets to know one another and eventually become intimate to the extent that they start dating &#8211; even regardless of the fact that Samantha lacks a body.As you might expect, the trials and tribulations of dating someone that really doesn&#8217;t exist takes a prominent role in the latter half of the film.  Theodore must also face his ex-wife, Catherine (Rooney Mara) and her judgment, all while struggling with whether or not to sign his divorce papers and officially ending their partnership.  The past looms large over Theodore and he continuously ponders the idea of spending his future with a constantly evolving machine.  Some people are okay with the idea, but he must first face down his own inner turmoil about what he wants for himself.It really doesn&#8217;t take much for the synopsis of this film to make it out to be a rather ridiculous idea.  However, that couldn&#8217;t be any further from the truth, thus making Her one of the freshest plots in recent memory.  Spike Jonze deserves more than half of the credit since he alone wrote the film, produced the film, and directed the film.  Once again, if you&#8217;re at all familiar with Jonze, then you&#8217;ll also probably notice that he&#8217;s the one voicing the alien child in the video game that Theodore likes to play.  Jonze, who&#8217;s naturally funny anyway, happens to be a part of the most humorous moments that this film has to offer.Without a doubt, Jonze has struck gold with this film, but he couldn&#8217;t have done it without the marvelous casting of lead actor, Joaquin Phoenix.  Honestly, Phoenix&#8217;s career hasn&#8217;t been the same since that whole ridiculous rapping angle where he tried to convince people he retired and went a bit crazy.  In any event, his last role in The Master, along with his role in Her, has reestablished his credibility as one of the better actors in Hollywood.  He puts an unmitigated amount of emotion into this role and portrays a very confused, at times disassociated character.  Even though he puts on quite the impressive performance, he&#8217;s incredibly outshined by a mysterious (and easily identifiable) female voice &#8211; not to mention the actual story itself.As an actress (playing something as simple as a computer) that never appears on film, Scarlett Johansson couldn&#8217;t have been better as the OS, Samantha.  Believe it or not, the emotional journey isn&#8217;t any less moving without her there physically &#8211; and it almost has the feeling of a somewhat long-distance relationship.  The amount of acceptance that her character is given by Theodore&#8217;s friends is convincing enough to establish this film as something that could be very possible in the not so distant future.  At the same time, it&#8217;s rather disturbing just how much (and quickly) she evolves, making it nearly impossible not to think of a film like The Terminator in the process (since the computers take over the world).  Still, as far as relationships goes, these OS programs might be an early look at the future of society (currently evident with Apple&#8217;s Siri personal assistant program).  And, in case you&#8217;re wondering, this story does not avoid the absurdity of dating a computer and tackles that subject, too.Overall, Her is a love story for the digital age &#8211; and to be frank, it&#8217;s long overdue for an honest, authentic look at the direction society might be traveling towards.  Together, Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlett Johansson mesh unexpectedly well &#8211; and even perform musical duet together at one point.  This film not only focuses on a human/PC relationship, it also tackles the hardships involved with relationships in general.  That aspect alone makes this one of the most enjoyable films during this award season.  Regardless, Spike Jonze has created a masterpiece that should be recognized, not only for the incorporation of the great acting and ironic subtleties, but also for its direction, soundtrack, and screenplay.  Her is a film that everyone in the modern digital age should take a chance on viewing.  While some scenes can be unnerving, it&#8217;s worth it to witness a film that might just look like the future of humanity.GRADE:  A",5,Spike Jonze has created a gem with the flawless

I started watching Her and the movie from the start didn't even catch my interest but I tagged along hoping it would get better. Needless to say it didn't however; I got a very good laugh out of this movie and it wasn't even made for the purpose of being funny.Set in the future, Theodore the main character is a letter writer who writes letters for other people that they can send to their loved once on their behave [Weird I know, considering they can just use an app or software to write it down instead] but anyways, Theodore is going through a very painful recent separation from his wife Catherine who left him due to shortcomings on his part and is looking to sign those divorce papers. Although his friends are encouraging him to start dating again Theodore is hesitant and spends most of his time alone or at work, then one day he buys an advance Operating System for his digital devices and that's where he embarks on an emotionally filled love affair with the virtual sound of the OS called Samantha.Yes, in short it's a romance between a man and his computer. Now, I'm fully aware that some people have relationships between them and innate objects clearly that's nothing new or never heard of before. Some even go to the extent of marrying their objects of affection. Personal choices and freedom.In Her however, the case is a tad different. You see, the operating system is designed to be two dimensional replica of an actual person. It has conversational skills, personality yup it's that advanced to the point where you actually start believing it is a person and not a thing. So, it's no wonder Theodore was so hooked to Samantha especially that he's isolated from the world. It does seem to be a lot more easier to establish a partnership with a computer than an actual person who has ups and downs. The movie started going downhill the moment Theodore decided he was going to not only have cyber sex with his OS but also that he has feelings for her. It was one laughable scene after another. So badly executed that I just couldn't take the movie seriously.I couldn't be sucked into Theodore's world unfortunately. I didn't buy his romance with Samantha at all and I'm a very open minded person. The movie was just painful to watch and boring at times. There was no suspense, no heart or feelings in this movie.If anything it was rather sad and depressing. I mean Theodore doesn't even get his happy ending at the end, we all knew he never would considering he was in an emotional relationship with his OS and that makes it even sadder.I just didn't like this film.

1686422,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B00H9HZGQ0,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[7, 10]","Truth be told, I've never been a huge fan of Spike Jonze as a filmmaker. I thought that he was obviously a creative individual getting his start in film through making visually striking and much-admired music videos for the likes of The Beastie Boys, R.E.M., and Bjork. His first feature film, the Charlie Kaufman-penned BEING JOHN MALKOVICH, to me, radiated a vibe of a hipster David Lynch, and while being creative, just seemed to be too clever for its own good. With his follow-up ADAPTATION, also penned by Kaufman, it seemed to me to be more of a hipper-than-thou version of a Coen Brothers film. But with the romantic sci-fi high-concept HER, Jonze seems to have found a beautiful love story, a uncomfortably real portrait of loneliness, and maybe even something of a cautionary tale, but most importantly, it seems to be his most accessible and most distinct film, not to mention one of the very best films of 2013.HER, set in a not-terribly-distant future Los Angeles, follows the daily grind of Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix), an introverted, introspective, and disconnected man whose job is composing love letters to people using sample writing from other people. He is in the midst of a divorce from his wife Catherine (Rooney Mara), and his only real human connection is with his married friend Amy (Amy Adams). He plays video games and goes to sex chatrooms connected through his smartphone to make something of a connection with other people. Soon though, the OS1 is released, which is an artificially intelligent operating system for computers and phones. He buys it, installs it, and selects a female voice to be the OS. She calls herself Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson), and she is a wonder right out of the box. She's immediately charming, funny, intelligent and sexy. She's the perfect woman for Theodore, but she is just a program. Regardless, Theodore takes her with him everywhere, even fastening a safety pin in his shirt pocket so that the phone's camera sticks out above the top, and can be her eyes to the real world. Before long, Theodore wants only to spend all of his waking and sleeping hours with Samantha, and strangely, vice versa. They are in love. But Samantha wants to be tactile for him. They both know that something that is only a simluation of a love affair can never be as fulfilling as the real thing. But is it real? Can a person fall in love with a program, and can it fall in love back?HER is a work of sublime genius in all of its categories. Jonze writes and directs this feature without reliance on his past quirkiness, allowing the camera to tell the story, and creating this world through his amazing screenplay without judgment on its characters or the situation and allowing the world to exist in a state of ambiguity gives the audience more opportunity to judge for themselves what they've just seen. From an acting standpoint, Phoenix, like his namesake, has risen from the ashes of delving into his inside-joke faux-career as a would-be rapper that might have propelled him into obscurity, but with his amazing performance in THE MASTER last year and his remarkable performance in this film, he can still be considered easily one of the great actors of his generation. Theodore is practically the antithesis of just about every character he's ever played; he's a nebbishy, shy sad-sack who barely peeks out of his shell, as opposed to the extremely volatile and flamboyant personalities he usually appears as, and playing against type is just what makes this one of Phoenix's most potent performances. Adams is perfect as the girl next door; she seems to exist only to be the platonic apple of Theodore's eye, but still makes a three-dimensional character out of this trope. But even these acting powerhouses take something of a backseat to the work done by Johansson here. Aside from the vocal and physical work that Andy Serkis put into the character of Gollum/Smeagol in THE LORD OF THE RINGS films, this is the only other time that I feel that a vocal performance should have been eligible for an Oscar. Johansson gives this film her all, and you can feel her glee, her passion, her sadness and her reality just through her voice. It's just this side of miraculous.There are scenes in HER that will stay with you long after the film is over. The first sex chat scene between Phoenix and the voice of Kristen Wiig is crazy and utterly hilarious; the songwriting scene with Theodore and Samantha is a thing of great and deep beauty; their love scene is tender and sexy; the blind date he has with Olivia Wilde's character is exciting, fun, but illustrates Theodore as a man committed to his perfect non-human ideal; the flesh-and-blood surrogate that Samantha enlists to be her body for Theodore is one of the most uncomfortable scenes in American cinema this year; and pretty much the entirety of the third act is breathtaking and heartbreaking and affirming. I know that the film's concept is what's on most people's minds when they wonder about this film, but the question of ""Can a human being really fall in love with a machine?"" is secondary to the exploration of how love even exists to begin with. As Amy calls love at one point in the film, ""The only socially acceptable form of insanity"": That's the point that cuts straight to the heart of the film, and the film, in hindsight, becomes less a critique of our society's dependence on immediately-available technology. That's not to say that it's not a question worth exploring, but it's not the question that drives the film.HER has been whisking away Best Original Screenplay awards since awards season began, and deservedly so. It raises so many questions about humanity and human nature and the nature of love, and even endeavors to try to answer some of them. It's a remarkable film that is funny, charming, smart, moving, and ultimately a one-of-a-kind.

Lane ""professional audience member""","[5, 7]","Writer/director Spike Jonze (with a post-production boost from Steven Soderbergh) directs this sweetly weird but much-acclaimed story about a lonely writer in the process of a divorce, who buys a new operating system which provides him with an electronic companion. The more he talks with the OS, the smarter it gets. This unique and unpredictable film holds our attention from the very beginning.We see (and hear):* Joaquin Phoenix (&#34;Walk the Line&#34;) stars as Theodore, the mildly depressed fellow with the new operating system; he selects a female voice and names it &#34;Samantha.&#34; I've never seen Phoenix laugh so freely.* Amy Adams (&#34;Man of Steel&#34;) brings us Amy, a friend in his residential tower who is married to a control freak.* Rooney Mara (&#34;The Social Network&#34;) is his soon-to-be ex. All they have to do is sign the divorce papers but they have never discussed what went wrong.* Olivia Wilde (&#34;Butter&#34;) plays the charming blind date who doesn't want to be a flash in the pan. She would really like a relationship.* Scarlett Johansson (&#34;Don Jon&#34;) voices Samantha, the irresistibly sweet and funny OS, who becomes the light of his life.* Chris Pratt (&#34;Delivery Man&#34;) is Paul, totally happy to go on a double date, even though his friend Theodore is dating an operating system.This has been nominated for three Golden Globes, so let me add my own comments: the editing is brilliant. Subtle expressions which flit across Phoenix's face, reflect his reactions to Samantha's voice as she speaks. There are many long, long takes of just his face and voice reacting to Samantha. You will NOT be bored unless you have a hearing problem, in which case either go to a theater with closed captions or wait for the DVD. By the way, in another auditorium (same complex) the next day, I saw previews for this one and could hear every single word. Maybe it was the copy we saw at the screening. Hmmm....Shot in Shanghai and Los Angeles, augmented by some green screen work, this gives us a frightening peek at the not-too-distant future, with everyone totally involved with his or her hand-held electronic device; there is no human interaction on the street, in the train or at the desk.

It is very thought provoking about the future of artificial intelligence and personal communications devices and computers and how these affect the way we maintain real human relationships.Theodore Twombly, acted by Joaquin Phoenix is one his best performances ever, is an old-fashioned letter writer. Set in the not-too-distant future, maybe 20-30 years from now, Theodore sits in a cubicle in a high rise office building in L.A. dictating and typing love letters for people who are unable to express themselves articulately in writing. He's very good at his job, and some of his letters, read aloud throughout the film, are quite touching in a sappy, emotive Hallmark kind of way. Ironically, Theodore is emotionally stunted and is in the middle of a sad, protracted divorce from his wife.Theodore is depressed and lonely and goes through the motions of his day, rising, commuting via high speed train to his high rise building and returning at the end of the day to his sparsely decorated high rise apartment building. The clean, high speed train is the main give-away that this is set in the future. Imagine how that will transform L.A. !Wherever they are, whether commuting, dining, walking, working, people everywhere seem to have earpieces inserted and are talking away to the voices in their ears, but rarely to each other. They are completely disconnected from each other. Theodore has a couple of friends in the building, and is particularly fond of the charming character played by Amy Adams. Theodore decides to buy a new operating system, which is promoted as an OS that is highly customized to the individual and relies on AI. Theodore name his OS Samantha and she is voiced by Scarlett Johansson. He spends more and more time with her as they get to know each other better, and she becomes more human-like. In one bizarre scene, he even takes her on a &#34;date&#34; - a picnic with another couple. Some people criticize him for having such a close relationship with his OS; others seem to think it is completely normal.This is a role unlike any other Joaquin Phoenix has played. He is vulnerable and sometimes incredibly appealing and sexy, and other times dorky and needy. He totally inhabits the role, and is in essentially every scene, usually acting against no one - just the voice of Samantha.I won't reveal what eventually happens between Theodore and Samantha, but it certainly brings into question where the technology that we're all becoming more and more reliant is taking us.

Weaver ""karlweaver""","[1, 2]","This is the latest twist on a question which has been bothering mankind since before the dawn of the &#34;computer age&#34; : will we at some point create something with &#34;artificial intelligence?&#34;  And if so, what will our relationship with it be like?  Early examples of this theme, I think, may be seen in Mary Shelley's 1818 Frankenstein's Monster novel, or Fritz Lang's &#34;Metropolis&#34; from 1927.  In somewhat more recent years, the Terminator movie series,  Blade Runner and Battlestar Galactica come to mind.  None of these are particularly optimistic visions.  Two things seem to bother those who take the question seriously: will they turn on us?  Or even if they don't, will we end up feeling like the inferior being?In Spike's film the question has a different twist.  As every review notes, the main character Theodore is at a particularly lonely and vulnerable time of life, he and his wife having separated and lawyers are pressuring him to sign the divorce papers.  He sees an advertisement for a new operating system, touted as the world's first actually intelligent system.Though corporate names aren't used, watching the ad, Apple immediately came to mind.  Here's something hot, or cool, the Next Big Thing.  He bites.  Now comes what I thought was one of the most humorous scenes in the movie, as during set-up he's asked a few simple questions about himself so that the operating system can be customized for better compatibility with him.  Here follows what I imagine to be about the exact opposite of applying to Match.com (not having looked at the latter but having read descriptions and heard their ads).  I can't describe further without spoiling the fun if you haven't watched yet.Well, he's a lonely guy and wants a system with a female voice, so up comes Scarlett Johanssen's voice as his new operating system, who proceeds to name herself Samantha (scanning a list of thousands of female names in less than a second and, somehow deciding she liked that one best.These new OS's genuinely appear to have artificial intelligence and what proceeds is a &#34;guy meets girl&#34; story, with the complication that &#34;She&#34; has no body...and that her thoughts are measured in something like nanoseconds rather than seconds, though of course she has probably an ingrained sensibility to speak at a normal human rate.  One can sense that this relationship probably cannot endure, for more reasons than the lack of a body...Like most good &#34;science fiction&#34; this is a commentary on society TODAY as much as it is any guess about the future.  Do we not have scenes unfolding today of 4 people sitting down to a meal, all 4 of them busy texting unseen others rather than talking to each other?  Do you not frequently pass people on the street busily engaged in conversation with unseen others (usually too-loudy)?  Have we gone from discourse on the level of the Federalist Papers or Gettysburg address, to &#34;tweets&#34;?As Ted becomes increasingly dependent on his relationship with non-physical Samantha, he precludes the potential for real relationships with single and attractive females.  Briefly in the middle of the movie, we hear that other people all around are undergoing their own unique, problematic &#34;relationships&#34; with their new OS's too...and are treated to a sad scene in which Ted and his wife sit down to sign their divorce papers--neither actually quite sure they really want to do it, but there they are, nicely worked out by their attorneys...To go further with the plot would be a spoiler, but I'll just say this is a relationship movie more than a science fiction movie.  It moves at a somewhat leisurely pace in spots.  It's primarily a straightforward story arc, interrupted only by brief flashbacks of Ted's memories of all the good parts of his marriage in past years.  There's no nudity, physical violence, or crude language, though sex is definitely discussed from time to time.  This is character and story-driven, and any CG used to depict what the future might look like seems believable, and takes a back seat to the acting.  I saw this first pay-per-view and am eager to get the Blu-Ray and see if there are any interesting &#34;bonus&#34; features there.  If you're prepared for a relationship film rather than a traditional sci-fi film then you should enjoy the movie as I did.",4,This is well-done,1400371200,"05 18, 2014",2014,4366,"['latest', 'twist', 'question', 'been', 'bothering', 'mankind', 'dawn', '34', 'computer', 'age', '34', 'will', 'point', 'create', 'something', '34', 'artificial', 'intelligence', '34', 'so', 'what', 'will', 'relationship', 'be', 'Early', 'examples', 'theme', 'think', 'may', 'be', 'seen', 'Mary', 'Shelley', '1818', 'Frankenstein', 'Monster', 'novel', 'Fritz', 'Lang', '34', 'Metropolis', '34', '1927', 'somewhat', 'more', 'recent', 'years', 'Terminator', 'movie', 'series', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'come', 'mind', 'None', 'are', 'particularly', 'optimistic', 'visions', 'Two', 'things', 'seem', 'bother', 'who', 'take', 'question', 'seriously', 'will', 'turn', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'will', 'end', 'up', 'feeling', 'inferior', 'being', 'Spike', 'film', 'question', 'different', 'twist', 'review', 'notes', 'main', 'character', 'Theodore', 'particularly', 'lonely', 'vulnerable', 'time', 'life', 'wife', 'having', 'separated', 'lawyers', 'are', 'pressuring', 'sign', 'divorce', 'papers', 'advertisement', 'new', 'operating', 'system', 'touted', 'world', 'first', 'actually', 'intelligent', 'system.Though', 'corporate', 'names', 'are', ""n't"", 'used', 'watching', 'ad', 'Apple', 'immediately', 'came', 'mind', 'Here', 'something', 'hot', 'cool', 'Next', 'Big', 'Thing', 'Now', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'humorous', 'scenes', 'movie', 'set-up', 'asked', 'few', 'simple', 'questions', 'so', 'operating', 'system', 'can', 'be', 'customized', 'better', 'compatibility', 'Here', 'what', 'imagine', 'be', 'exact', 'opposite', 'applying', 'Match.com', 'not', 'having', 'looked', 'latter', 'having', 'read', 'descriptions', 'heard', 'ads', 'ca', ""n't"", 'describe', 'further', 'spoiling', 'fun', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'yet.Well', 'lonely', 'guy', 'system', 'female', 'voice', 'Scarlett', 'Johanssen', 'voice', 'new', 'operating', 'system', 'who', 'name', 'Samantha', 'scanning', 'list', 'thousands', 'female', 'names', 'less', 'second', 'somehow', 'deciding', 'liked', 'one', 'best.These', 'new', 'OS', 'genuinely', 'appear', 'have', 'artificial', 'intelligence', 'what', 'proceeds', '34', 'guy', 'meets', 'girl', '34', 'story', 'complication', '34', '34', 'body', 'thoughts', 'are', 'measured', 'something', 'nanoseconds', 'rather', 'seconds', 'course', 'probably', 'ingrained', 'sensibility', 'speak', 'normal', 'human', 'rate', 'One', 'can', 'sense', 'relationship', 'probably', 'can', 'not', 'endure', 'more', 'reasons', 'lack', 'body', 'most', 'good', '34', 'science', 'fiction', '34', 'commentary', 'society', 'TODAY', 'as', 'much', 'guess', 'future', 'Do', 'not', 'have', 'scenes', 'unfolding', 'today', '4', 'people', 'sitting', 'down', 'meal', '4', 'busy', 'texting', 'unseen', 'others', 'rather', 'talking', 'other', 'Do', 'not', 'frequently', 'pass', 'people', 'street', 'busily', 'engaged', 'conversation', 'unseen', 'others', 'usually', 'too-loudy', 'Have', 'gone', 'discourse', 'level', 'Federalist', 'Papers', 'Gettysburg', 'address', '34', 'tweets', '34', 'Ted', 'increasingly', 'dependent', 'relationship', 'non-physical', 'Samantha', 'potential', 'real', 'relationships', 'single', 'attractive', 'females', 'Briefly', 'middle', 'movie', 'hear', 'other', 'people', 'around', 'are', 'undergoing', 'own', 'unique', 'problematic', '34', 'relationships', '34', 'new', 'OS', 'too', 'are', 'treated', 'sad', 'scene', 'Ted', 'wife', 'sit', 'down', 'sign', 'divorce', 'papers', 'actually', 'quite', 'sure', 'really', 'want', 'do', 'there', 'are', 'nicely', 'worked', 'out', 'attorneys', 'go', 'further', 'plot', 'would', 'be', 'spoiler', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'relationship', 'movie', 'more', 'science', 'fiction', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'leisurely', 'pace', 'spots', 'primarily', 'straightforward', 'story', 'arc', 'interrupted', 'only', 'brief', 'flashbacks', 'Ted', 'memories', 'good', 'parts', 'marriage', 'past', 'years', 'nudity', 'physical', 'violence', 'crude', 'language', 'sex', 'definitely', 'discussed', 'time', 'time', 'character', 'story-driven', 'CG', 'used', 'depict', 'what', 'future', 'might', 'look', 'believable', 'back', 'seat', 'acting', 'saw', 'first', 'pay-per-view', 'am', 'eager', 'get', 'Blu-Ray', 'see', 'are', 'interesting', '34', 'bonus', '34', 'features', 'there', ""'re"", 'prepared', 'relationship', 'film', 'rather', 'traditional', 'sci-fi', 'film', 'then', 'should', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'did']",N/A

1686458,A1OZAYRJQAERTK,B00H9HZGQ0,Larry Benjamin,"[1, 2]","While the question of whether a man can fall in love with a conscious operating system is a great premise for a film, the story moved too slowly and had too many stupefyingly dull sections where I had to struggle to stay awake.  Part of the problem was the deadly seriousness - a little humor would have helped tremendously.  The Joaquin Phoenix character (Theodore Twombly - a fine British name) was appealing in a quiet, nebbishy sort of way, despite his dead-caterpillar moustache that would make him a shoo-in for Bryan Cranston if they ever decide to make a &#34;Breaking Bad&#34; prequel.  His job, writing heartfelt, personalized letters for people unable to express themselves, underscored the contrast between his difficulty in connecting with people in real life and how easliy he falls in love with the &#34;Samantha&#34; OS.  Many people have certainly developed similar relationships online with others, through nothing more than typed messages and phone conversations, so once you accept that a computer program can be as sensitive and intelligent as a human being, that aspect of the film wasn't all that unbelievable.Another problem was Scarlett Johansson's voice, which has a rough, harsh texture that becomes somewhat grating when you aren't distracted by her appearance.  I'd never noticed it before in any of her other films; this is the first one where she essentially acted in voice-over.  Maybe I'm unusual, but I would want an OS like &#34;Samantha&#34; to have as pleasant and melodious a voice as possible.There were a few scenes that implied that everyone in the world was in a relationship with an OS, so it was a major omission by the filmmakers to not show more of how their sudden absence affected everyone.  This is simply an indicator of how it's not enough to build a film on a &#34;high concept;&#34; you need more great details and the kind of editing that moves the story along fast enough to maintain interest.  This wasn't a visual and auditory feast like &#34;The Great Beauty&#34; that could get away with a minimal plot.  &#34;Her&#34; needed more excitement than the one scene where Twombly thinks Samantha is gone because the OS is briefly inaccessible during an upgrade.Ultimately, a mildly interesting but forgettable film.",2,"Great concept, lousy execution",1405123200,"07 12, 2014",2014,2269,"['question', 'man', 'can', 'fall', 'love', 'conscious', 'operating', 'system', 'great', 'premise', 'film', 'story', 'moved', 'too', 'slowly', 'had', 'too', 'many', 'stupefyingly', 'dull', 'sections', 'where', 'had', 'struggle', 'stay', 'awake', 'Part', 'problem', 'was', 'deadly', 'seriousness', 'little', 'humor', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'tremendously', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'character', 'Theodore', 'Twombly', 'fine', 'British', 'name', 'was', 'appealing', 'quiet', 'nebbishy', 'sort', 'way', 'dead-caterpillar', 'moustache', 'would', 'make', 'shoo-in', 'Bryan', 'Cranston', 'ever', 'decide', 'make', '34', 'Breaking', 'Bad', '34', 'prequel', 'job', 'writing', 'heartfelt', 'personalized', 'letters', 'people', 'unable', 'express', 'underscored', 'contrast', 'difficulty', 'connecting', 'people', 'real', 'life', 'how', 'easliy', 'love', '34', 'Samantha', '34', 'OS', 'Many', 'people', 'have', 'certainly', 'developed', 'similar', 'relationships', 'online', 'others', 'nothing', 'more', 'typed', 'messages', 'phone', 'conversations', 'so', 'once', 'accept', 'computer', 'program', 'can', 'be', 'sensitive', 'intelligent', 'human', 'being', 'aspect', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'problem', 'was', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'voice', 'rough', 'harsh', 'texture', 'somewhat', 'grating', 'when', 'are', ""n't"", 'distracted', 'appearance', ""'d"", 'never', 'noticed', 'other', 'films', 'first', 'one', 'where', 'essentially', 'acted', 'voice-over', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'unusual', 'would', 'want', 'OS', '34', 'Samantha', '34', 'have', 'pleasant', 'melodious', 'voice', 'possible.There', 'were', 'few', 'scenes', 'implied', 'everyone', 'world', 'was', 'relationship', 'OS', 'was', 'major', 'omission', 'filmmakers', 'not', 'show', 'more', 'how', 'sudden', 'absence', 'affected', 'everyone', 'simply', 'indicator', 'how', 'not', 'enough', 'build', 'film', '34', 'high', 'concept', '34', 'need', 'more', 'great', 'details', 'kind', 'editing', 'story', 'fast', 'enough', 'maintain', 'interest', 'was', ""n't"", 'visual', 'auditory', 'feast', '34', 'Great', 'Beauty', '34', 'could', 'get', 'away', 'minimal', 'plot', '34', 'Her', '34', 'needed', 'more', 'excitement', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'Twombly', 'Samantha', 'gone', 'OS', 'briefly', 'inaccessible', 'upgrade.Ultimately', 'mildly', 'interesting', 'forgettable', 'film']",N/A

I waited for this movie to come-out to DVD, and once I finally saw it---it left me satisfied that my own intuition about this film was correct.After seeing Her (2013) by Spike Jones, it took me few days to analyze the depth of the film.  Even though the message behind it is quite simple, it should make viewers of this film think more about what the future holds, or rather where our society is heading in terms of human relations.  Her is a film about loneliness, not of one man, but of mankind.  The type of loneliness, where technology, or Operating System (OS) replaces our need to communicate or even co-exist with the living and breathing surrounding. Theodore played wonderfully and very convincingly by (Phoenix) is a young men,heading towards his middle age, who is separated from his wife and working for a company that deals with writing letters and event-whishes for others.  Yes, it might sound strange, but our main protagonist writes love letters and anniversary wishes for clients for a living, and he is really good at it.  To make the story short, Theodore suffers from his recent break up with his wife and tries to cope with loneliness (loneliness is the major subject of this film).  One day he buys an OS, a really sophisticated artificial intelligence, and he installs it on to his phone.  The OS is so intriguing, funny, intelligent, and perfect, that it almost seems human.  Theodore slowly falls in love with his OS, and the OS (Scarlett Johansson's voice) develops feelings for Theodore.  What is interesting is that, Theodore has a human female co-worker friend that he likes, but their relationship is platonic for she too is dating an OS.  There are some quirky and funny moments in the movie...but overall the movie is pretty sad.  The music by Arcade Fire together with the classical music played throughout the movie make the film dismal and almost gloomy. The ending is heartbreaking, and so is the future we find ourselves be living in...Theodore's character is near similar to Tom Hansen from 500 Days of Summer (2009) and Winston Smith from the novel 1984 by George Orwell.  In that, all three characters are lonely, anti-social misfits, characterized by their longing to be recognized and loved.  Even their professions are alike, all three men Theodore, Tom and Winston work in a cubical like environment. Separated from others, dealing with others' emotions while suppressing theirs.

Her voice is raspy and slightly annoying; imagine Scarlett Johansson without the looks; but her personality is decidedly charming. That a man, especially a lonely divorcee named Theodore, could find himself romantically intrigued by her is the believable part. That he'd turn down immediate sex from two real women, two real attractive women, for the sake of his relationship with her stretches the believability factor quite thin. She doesn't even have a pussy. He has to imagine one while listening to her groan as he masturbates.A relationship is supposed to be about more than the physical stuff, of course. I guess that's the point. But the physical stuff is important, as even the computer girl, named Samantha, acknowledges. She's mostly jokey and easy-going but seems to suffer from the Pinocchio complex of wanting desperately to experience life as a real (physical) human-being. But human-beings fall out of love, a fact Theodore knows all too well. Whether or not that also goes for operating systems programmed to learn and evolve is anyone's guess. It's a chance Theodore is willing to take. If that seems silly, it is.

Due to social media and the cell phones, and the tablets and the computers that help us get through daily life, we have forgotten how to connect with one another on a human level. This is only one of the grand ideas explored in Spike Jonze&#8217;s &#8216;love story&#8217; &#8220;Her&#8221;.Set in the near future (maybe 20 years from now), Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix), a writer who is left withdrawn and deeply saddened by his recent divorce downloads &#8220;the first artificially intelligent operating system&#8221;, and receives an OS assistant in the form of Samantha, voiced by Scarlett Johansson. Way more than your average Siri, Samantha is sweet, soulful, smart and frighteningly human. She asks personal questions and wants to be a real part of Theodore&#8217;s life. Eventually, they develop a romantic relationship, if you could call it that.Theodore has always had trouble committing in relationships. Not that he&#8217;s going to go out and cheat at first chance, but you get the impression that he is really irked by spending the remainder of his life with one person. He&#8217;s sensitive but has trouble communicating his feelings. This ended his marriage with Catherine (Rooney Mara). The only consistent female relationship he&#8217;s ever had is with his onetime girlfriend and longtime friend Amy (Amy Adams), who is also &#8216;friends&#8217; with her operating system.The mood of &#8220;Her&#8221; reminded me alot of &#8220;Lost in Translation&#8221;. The metropolis of Los Angeles has never been more gorgeous than it is in &#8220;Her&#8221;, but it makes a point to show how isolated people are becoming in the world these days. This is, of course, set in the future, but it isn&#8217;t that far off at all. In this universe, computers are almost completely controlled by voice commands. People wear earpieces that navigate their computers, cell phones and operating systems. People are constantly wandering the streets, but it&#8217;s rare that you find someone who isn&#8217;t walking by themselves, talking to their operating systems or having emails read to them over their little earpieces.If you think about it, people are becoming more and more isolated in the world we live in today. This kind of stuff could absolutely be a reality one day in the near future. With technological breakthroughs becoming more and more advanced and ostentatious, the technological universe explored in &#8220;Her&#8221; could easily become a reality one day, and that&#8217;s a sad thing.It&#8217;s a mood piece. There&#8217;s a generally gloomy and somber aura around the film, but it&#8217;s consistently fascinating and entertaining. We go to the movies because we want the filmmaker to take us somewhere. Jonze creates a complex and fascinating world that will leave you with many internal questions about yourself and others around you.Theodore experiences such joy carrying Samantha around and talking to her, even taking a vacation with her, and it makes the viewer so sad, because this guy is really just talking to himself, basically. The viewer should feel sorry for him, but they should also just truly understand him. We are all looking for something or someone to make a human connection with, and &#8220;Her&#8221; reminds us that it&#8217;s hard and sometimes a loser&#8217;s battle.

1686486,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00H9HZGQ0,M. Oleson,"[4, 6]","Theatrical review.  There may be spoilers.In the near future Los Angeles (Shanghai subbing for L. A.) created by Spike Jonze everyone walks around the hazy city talking to themselves with one of those Bluetooth-like receivers, hardly noticeable, stuck into their ear.  While everyone has a small cell phone device, it's usually in the pocket.  It looks stupid in the fictional future as it does today.Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix in perhaps his best performance) is a bit of a dweeb, working for a company that writes personal letters for clients who don't have the gift of language to express their emotions.  Theodore has just broken up with his wife and love of his life.  Catherine (Rooney Mara) and Theodore have known each other since their school days but as many marriages go they have become more distant.  Divorce is imminent.Theodore's life is lonely and he decides to splurge on the newest computer operating system.  After a brief interview by a computer he is provided with his new computer voice.  This time a woman's voice replacing a man's.  But this O/S is different.  It has the ability to adapt and is constantly learning.  It is also voiced by Scarlett Johansson who gives herself the name Samantha.  While this new OS1 system is relatively new and likely expensive, it is not unusual for it to become friends or friendly and in Theodore's case even romantic with their users.In the theater I was in, a couple of middle aged women behind me began laughing and giggling early on.  And for the life of me I couldn't understand why.  I suspect they had stumbled into a movie expecting a comedy, the likes of something Will Ferrell and Kristen Wiig might star in.  Although the movie has humor (Wiig is actually in this movie as the voice of SexyKitten, Theodore's ""phone date"") it is more appropriately a mature romance.  The idea of having a relationship with a computer, even an evolved one, seems ridiculous on the surface.  But Jonze presents the material in such a way that it gets past the weird phase quickly.  He is helped of course by a couple remarkable performances by Phoenix and Johansson.  Each have different challenges.  Phoenix is on-screen for the whole movie, often acting by himself or with a bodiless voice.  Johansson actually did her role after filming had ended.  She manages to convince the audience that, sure one could fall for her.Amy Adams plays uh...Amy, Theodore's best friend.  No romance there which is why I suspect, her looks are glammed way down.  Olivia Wilde plays a quasi-blind date (he's seen her picture) for Theodore.  Some trio of co-stars for Joaquin.  If I have a quibble, it is with some of the sets and costumes.  Theodore, in particular, has some of the ugliest clothes possible.  The interiors just didn't seem futuristic.  This film is beautifully written (Spike Jonze again) and has some interesting characters.  It is emotional, deeply romantic and ultimately a bit sad.

If you're expecting anything science-fiction-ie, you're going to have a bad time.What I see is a collection of metaphors, how we deal with technology, how we deal with people, how technology is becoming a part of our lives, how we see each other, our full-time connection to the Internet, what is to be human, what it is to be machine.  Then, the film takes some of these concepts and lets them run off the rails like an out of control game of The Sims to see how far the simulation can go until it becomes absurd.Perhaps those negative comments come from those too young, who not yet experienced a real human relationship, spending too much time in the basement playing video games.  This movie more for adults who can spot a relationship running amuck or those little clues that you need to put some space between you and the woman you're dating - immediately.Or, perhaps this illustrates what can happen when we don the video glasses and talk to our cell phones like they're human.It's a love story which has only one person in it.",5,One of the best I've watched in a long while,1402704000,"06 14, 2014",2014,1308,"['felt', 'need', 'write', 'few', 'words', 'film', 'feedback', 'negative', 'comments', 'Perhaps', 'billed', 'incorrectly', 'sci-fi', 'thriller', 'where', 'operating', 'system', 'computer', 'sentient', 'being', 'uhh', 'yea', 'kinda', 'not', 'reason', 'watch', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'anything', 'science-fiction-ie', ""'re"", 'going', 'have', 'bad', 'time.What', 'see', 'collection', 'metaphors', 'how', 'deal', 'technology', 'how', 'deal', 'people', 'how', 'technology', 'becoming', 'part', 'lives', 'how', 'see', 'other', 'full-time', 'connection', 'Internet', 'what', 'be', 'human', 'what', 'be', 'machine', 'Then', 'film', 'concepts', 'run', 'off', 'rails', 'control', 'game', 'Sims', 'see', 'how', 'far', 'simulation', 'can', 'go', 'absurd.Perhaps', 'negative', 'comments', 'come', 'too', 'young', 'who', 'not', 'yet', 'experienced', 'real', 'human', 'relationship', 'spending', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'basement', 'playing', 'video', 'games', 'movie', 'more', 'adults', 'who', 'can', 'spot', 'relationship', 'running', 'amuck', 'little', 'clues', 'need', 'put', 'space', 'woman', ""'re"", 'dating', 'immediately.Or', 'perhaps', 'what', 'can', 'happen', 'when', 'don', 'video', 'glasses', 'talk', 'cell', 'phones', ""'re"", 'love', 'story', 'only', 'one', 'person']",N/A

The concept seemed intriguing and relevant, which is what motivated me to buy the ticket and sit through the film's duration waiting for interesting things to happen.  But not very much did.  There just didn't seem to be enough plot elements to fill up a whole film.  Also, I kept noticing missed opportunities for greater dramatic tension.  For example, most of the human characters just seemed so accepting of the human/operating system relationship dynamic, some friends even going on a double date with Joaquin Phoenix's character and his technological love.  It would have been much more interesting to see conflict and tension between our (anti-)hero and others who might feel threatened by his behavior.  Something to force this sad, soulful loner to stand up for something.This film did do a good job of pulling me into its world, a not-to-distant future where urban dwellers wear high-waisted pants, live in giant buildings and seem lonely or bored.  The sense of dystopia was vague and muted rather than in-your-face like in a Mad Max-type film.  This for me was the main pleasure of the movie, visiting this hypothetical world and thinking about how realistic it actually seemed.  Ultimately, this view of the future is what kept me in the theater while the plot failed to hold my attention.Much has been said about Joaquin Phoenix's performance in Her, and he really did seem to inhabit the Twombley character.  He also repeatedly reminded me of Johnny Galecki playing Leonard on Big Bang Theory (in his most depressive moments), only without the humor.  In retrospect this says a lot for my perception of this film - that it could have actually functioned better as a comedy.  Think about it - the soulful loner falls for his phone while his almost-that-nerdy friends try to figure out what to make of it.  One tries to follow suit with his own phone, another ridicules him, etc.  His parents roll their eyes and try to set him up with real girls.  Etc.  THAT would have been an enjoyable film.Bottom line, Her was a film that could have been so much more than it was.  Billed as an Important film about how people interact with increasingly complex technology, Her ultimately doesn't have all that much to say about that relationship and its broader social impact.  Joaquin Phoenix's performance doesn't really redeem the film very much, although it was well done.  If you want to see a very interesting and witty film about coping with loneliness, I recommend the heartfelt Lars and the Real Girl.

Instead, I'm going to tell you in my review what the movie does for me and this is why I like the movie.""Her"" is a film that like the petals on a rose, it has many layers:1. A touchy-feely film that takes a look at one's inner most feelings. I do not mean any disrespect, but this is a film that most men would not like for that reason. If one is into the Myers-Briggs Personality Indicator philosophy, one would say that the film's personality is an INFP. Some might say a too analytical investigation of emotions, over thought and over felt. Yet, it's the deep raw inner feelings that lay our souls bare, the exposed nerve of our inner core that I love about this film.2. One might say this is a commentary on how our society is becoming far too dependent on technology. Such dependence leaving us emotionally crippled in a sterile environment surrounded by our own selves and lacking the ability to interact with others. The irony of Theodore's job as a professional letter writer, who writes deep heartfelt emotional letters for people is not lost on the viewer. Will we become a society that is so far removed from our feelings, so busy with our schedules, that we are incapable of writing our own letters, expressing our own emotions to our loved ones?3. This film explores the age old question, ""What makes us human?"" Are we more than just our physical bodies? If we were to take our thoughts, our emotions, and our conscious awareness and place it into a computer, would then the computer be ""human""? The science of ""neural networks"" is becoming more and more of a reality as scientists and computer experts work together to achieve this type of ""immortality"". Which begs the question, ""If a deceased person's consciousness is transplanted into a computer or robot, does that make it a 'human' with rights?"" Just what is 'human'?4. Is a virtual relationship ""real""? As more and more people get into computer dating and cybersex, we find ourselves asking this question. Virtual reality games are springing up all over the Internet. One that comes to mind is called, ""Second Life"". I personally know of people who have had virtual relationships in Second Life using avatars and either using the voice capabilities in Second Life to talk to each other, or they call each other on Skype while they watch their computer screen as their avatars ""make love"", a type of virtual reality cybersex-relationship that is becoming more and more common place. These people in Second Life, most, who have never met each other in person, claim their relationship is real and they are very much in love. But, when the computer is turned off, the person isn't there. Does our love just turn off and on with the flick of a switch? Can a virtual love, without the physical touch that seems to be so very much a part of a relationship, be satisfying enough? Is it really a relationship or is it merely a modern version of phone sex? Is it love? I've heard of true stories where people in a bygone era, would fall in love through letters. My own maternal grandparents did just that. So is it such a stretch of the imagination that we can fall in love virtually?5. Can we love more than one person at the same time? Those who are in open marriages or open relationships claim that people are capable of having love, true romantic love, for more than one person at the same time. We see in the film how devastated Theodore becomes when he realizes he's ""just one of many"". We have all known or heard of people who have found out their loved one was cheating on them by finding a text message or an email. We all want to feel unique and special, but in an age when our technology makes it so very easy to have more than one relationship at the same time, we begin to question our heart's ability to withstand technological polygamy.6. ""Her"" cuts to the quick, the bottom line being as human, as people, all of us basically want to be accepted for who we are, not judged and to be loved. Such basic human needs, that no matter how far removed our society becomes from a simpler, less technological age, we still are creatures that all need and want acceptance and love.7. Is love just a biological chemical response or is it a deeper, transcendental, spiritual experience that goes beyond space and time? Love is more than just the scent of pheromones and the animal instinct to procreate. When we love, truly love, even after that person is gone from our life, our love still lives on. With each person who touches us deeply, they become a part of our soul. This film does not merely question love's transcendent nature, but stabs you in the heart with it as we watch the heart wrenching roller-coaster of emotions that Theodore experiences and as a result inevitably grows from it.8. What constitutes being a ""god""? If we make a computer or robot that is capable of being self-aware, in essence it is a ""sentient being"", then does that make us ""god"" as its creator? Will we go from being ""God's creation"" to becoming gods ourselves with the development of neural networks that can think, reason and feel emotions?9. And lastly, one can simply view this film as nothing more than just a very strange chick flick about relationships and breakups. But I doubt that the type of people this film appeals to would take such a narrow view of this work of art. And yes, in my opinion, this film is a work of art on many levels, between its cinematography, its music score and its ability to tell an entertaining and deeply moving story. By far, this is one of Joaquin Phoenix's best, showcasing his acting as a truly talented performer.""Her"" is now on my top 10 list as one of my favorite films. However ladies, if you have a husband or boyfriend who's idea of a great film is Rambo First Blood, then you may have a difficult time selling him on the idea of going to see such a sensitive, emotional movie. I think this would be a great film as a ""girls' night"" movie. Ladies, wear your sweats, pop some popcorn, get out the chocolate bars and the tissues, gather up your BFFs and sink into the sofa, relax and watch this film together. You'll be glad you did.UPDATE May 1, 2014 - Second viewing of the film:  OK, so I watched the movie a second time after reading all the other reviews here at Amazon. With the negative review points in my head as I watched the film for a second time, yes, the movie does have some rather creepy scenes. And now, come to think of it, this time around I kept reminding myself that as human as she sounds, Samantha is just a computer program so falling in love with her is well, really ridiculous. This time around I tried to place myself in Theodore's position and I realized that no matter how enduring and how much I seemed to bond with Samantha, given the situations Theodore was in, I still wouldn't have fallen in love because in the back of my mind, Samantha is just a very intuitive and clever computer program. I doubt I would have gone as far as Theodore did in sharing my personal emotions with Samantha. I would have kept the relationship on a purely professional level, that of a software owner and his software that provides itself as an electronic tool and organizer, similar to a boss and his administrative assistant. Other reviewers say that Theodore turning down Olivia Wilde and Portia Doubleday is ridiculous, but I don't think so. Olivia gets into the whole, ""I want a serious relationship"" after only meeting Theodore for the first time over drinks. To me, that's a huge turn off and pretty freaking scary. I think most people would run for the hills. Portia Doubleday, although very attractive, she's far younger than Theodore and a total stranger. For some men, this wouldn't be an issue. But perhaps Theodore is like my husband who has said that dating a girl much younger would seem like dating your daughter. Also my husband is an old fashioned kind of guy that needs to know a woman well and have an established relationship long before hopping in bed with her. Some men are like that and Theodore seems like that type of guy. So all those reviewers that criticize the movie script for having Theodore rejecting these women, claiming that a ""normal"" man would never turn these women down for sex, don't really view these scenes from the prospective of Theodore's nerdy nice guy personality and instead they are viewing these scenes and seeing them as if they themselves were offered sex with these women. Anywho...I still like the movie, ""Her"" and I still think it's as wonderful as I said in my previous review above, but I now am viewing it from a different angle and wanted to express my thoughts on this. I still recommend this movie. It definitely is a must see for those who are deep thinkers with strong emotions. Those looking for macho testosterone induced action films with car chases and lots of violence, best pass this movie up.",5,Introspectively Deep,1398816000,"04 30, 2014",2014,9059,"[""'m"", 'not',

1686519,A3VO05LD5WSO9F,B00H9HZGQ0,Robert Hayes,"[1, 2]","HER is a very creative and unique film that focuses on technology and interpersonal relationships in the modern age. The story is about Theodore Twombly, who works for a company that writes letters for people who have trouble expressing their feelings. Recently separated from his wife, he acquires a new operating system and develops a romantic relationship with it. I know that part sounds weird, but the universe of the film is an indeterminate future where technology has reached the point that true AI is possible. It is established very early on that Theodore has trouble maintaining relationships with people, and there's one scene in particular that hits this point home. He's on a date with an attractive woman, but as the night moves on to the possibility of sex, the woman wants a level of commitment that he just isn't ready to get into again. The way Joaquin Phoenix played him felt very layered and full of subtlety, and I was able to identify heavily with his character, in part because I share a lot of similar traits. Still, the revelation was Scarlett Johansson who gives a voice-only performance as Samantha, Theodore's personal OS. As the movie goes on, Samantha evolves, becomes more nuanced in her understanding of human interaction and inadvertently helps Theodore along as well. This makes what happens at the end seem more fitting than tragic, despite the melancholy overtones. What the film seems to be saying about technology is that it is a means to an end, rather than the culmination of something. Human relationships are a vital part of life, and can't be supplanted by anything else. From a technical standpoint, the film is remarkable in its creation of a sterile and believable future. The sci-fi elements aren't too heavy-handed, and the romantic aspects of the plot are handled with care. I also think they captured some beautiful images which were paired nicely with Arcade Fire's score/soundtrack. There's also a great supporting performance by Amy Adams. Overall, despite being a little lackadaisical in its pacing, I think this is a film worth watching, and that has important things to say about love and technology.",4,"My review of ""Her""",1404518400,"07 5, 2014",2014,2157,"['very', 'creative', 'unique', 'film', 'technology', 'interpersonal', 'relationships', 'modern', 'age', 'story', 'Theodore', 'Twombly', 'who', 'company', 'letters', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'trouble', 'expressing', 'feelings', 'Recently', 'separated', 'wife', 'new', 'operating', 'system', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'know', 'part', 'weird', 'universe', 'film', 'indeterminate', 'future', 'where', 'technology', 'reached', 'point', 'true', 'AI', 'possible', 'established', 'very', 'early', 'Theodore', 'trouble', 'maintaining', 'relationships', 'people', 'one', 'scene', 'particular', 'point', 'home', 'date', 'attractive', 'woman', 'night', 'moves', 'possibility', 'sex', 'woman', 'level', 'commitment', 'just', ""n't"", 'ready', 'get', 'again', 'way', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'played', 'felt', 'very', 'layered', 'full', 'subtlety', 'was', 'able', 'identify', 'heavily', 'character', 'part', 'share', 'lot', 'similar', 'traits', 'Still', 'revelation', 'was', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'who', 'voice-only', 'performance', 'Samantha', 'Theodore', 'personal', 'OS', 'movie', 'Samantha', 'more', 'nuanced', 'understanding', 'human', 'interaction', 'inadvertently', 'Theodore', 'along', 'as', 'well', 'what', 'end', 'seem', 'more', 'fitting', 'tragic', 'melancholy', 'overtones', 'What', 'film', 'be', 'saying', 'technology', 'means', 'end', 'rather', 'culmination', 'something', 'Human', 'relationships', 'are', 'vital', 'part', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'supplanted', 'anything', 'else', 'technical', 'standpoint', 'film', 'remarkable', 'creation', 'sterile', 'believable', 'future', 'sci-fi', 'elements', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'heavy-handed', 'romantic', 'aspects', 'plot', 'are', 'handled', 'care', 'also', 'think', 'captured', 'beautiful', 'images', 'were', 'paired', 'nicely', 'Arcade', 'Fire', 'score/soundtrack', 'also', 'great', 'supporting', 'performance', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'Overall', 'being', 'little', 'lackadaisical', 'pacing', 'think', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'important', 'things', 'say', 'love', 'technology']",N/A

No spoilers of course but some positive and negative below.The story was well acted and it echoed nicely the effervescent feeling of falling in love. There's also a strong lesson and warning in this movie as people become less and less connected to each other and more and more connected to their technology. In more than a few telling scenes we see crowds moving about oblivious to each other but only dialed in to their phones. Less seriously the movie does sport some genuinely funny moments.The negative aspects arise from the story itself. We're being shown a dark future and it seems almost that the film bails out at the last minute and veers towards a happy ending. It should be noted that my fiancee and I differ on the opinion of whether it's actually a happy ending or not but the fact that it's not as dark as its lesson.In summary, this one was rather a disappointment. I love a good cautionary tale but this one just wasn't driven home in the end. One can't live happily ever after and also be properly cautioned against the foibles of humanity.PS: It is always my endeavor to provide helpful reviews. If you find my review helpful then great!

The two in a sense do sometimes inspire each other to look out at the fragile, evanescent beauty of this world and our existence in it. There are some breathtaking panoramas of the vaguely futuristic, lovingly illuminated world that the two inhabit. But it isn&#8217;t enough. I was left wanting more. I was left with a sense of how any real bond has to consist of some working together in concert to accomplish something worthwhile. That doesn&#8217;t mean the parties to a relationship have to have arms and legs and sex organs and jump into the fray by running marathons for good causes. But it does mean that any meaningful togetherness has to consist of more than just talk about that togetherness &#8211; and more than just frolic and passing enjoyments.

(There&#8217;s even a great shot in a crowded subway, where everyone is spaced out to their respective electronic devices.) Joaquin Phoenix plays Theodore, a man going through a divorce who purchases a new Operating System with artificial intelligence capabilities, and develops a relationship with &#8220;her.&#8221;What follows is a fascinating look at how we project our romantic ideals onto others, as the OS (who names herself Samantha) forms herself to become the woman Theodore wants, or thinks he wants. As their relationship, and later romance, develops, we go through the typical and, in my opinion lazy, love story arcs of the honeymoon phase, boredom, and jealousy, but always with this unique narrative element of love between man and machine.We get a terrific performance from Joaquin Phoenix, who essentially carries the entire film; he is utterly convincing in his delivery and emotional reactions to what becomes a very real relationship to him. One of the more memorable scenes follows a blind date with a &#8220;real&#8221; woman, and he drunkenly confesses to Samantha that he&#8217;s scared his life is all downhill; his feelings now are all dimmer versions of how he&#8217;d feel before.The film&#8217;s ending is similarly powerful, with Theodore recognizing the danger of projecting a romantic ideal onto anyone, and the inherent growth every individual experiences over time. Every experience, every connection we make is what shapes us into who we are today. I honestly found myself tearing up along with Theodore, at this poignant, insightful reflection on love lost.What impresses me most of all is that this is fundamentally not a film about technology, but relationships. The artificial intelligence motif is a narrative device, but not the point of the movie.

It's set in Los Angeles in the not too distant future, and tells the story of Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix). He works as a writer, producing flowery love letters for people who who lack the ability to express their feelings. He's good at his job.Unfortunately, Theodore's own relationship is failing and he is soon to be divorced from his wife, Catherine (Rooney Mara). When he buys a new computer operating system, his life changes dramatically. The program adapts to his personality and needs, and evolves at a tremendous rate. This screen persona names 'herself' Samantha, and is voiced by Scarlett Johansson.To his surprise and delight, Theodore finds that he is able to connect with Samantha in ways that he never could with a physical person. Communication is everything in his relationship, and he finds it easy to express his deepest thoughts and feelings to Samantha. At the outset, it's probably a form of self-analysis, but as the relationship develops, it's clear that Samantha is real to Theodore.I think modern technology is under the microscope in this movie, and director Spike Jonze is observing how so many people are open to sharing their feelings on the Internet. It seems that many of us are less guarded and willing to risk revealing our secrets when we don't have to do it face-to-face. That's certainly true for me. The movie also deals with the irony of Theodore's success in writing about other people's feelings while struggling to communicate in his own personal life.Theodore's best friend, Amy (Amy Adams), is the only real person he feels comfortable talking with about the things that really matter in life. These are the kind of friends who are there for each other when they are most needed, no matter how hard it is to listen.I don't want to spoil any of the surprises, so I'll stop talking about the plot. The story is intelligent and thoughtful in its observations, and Phoenix is exceptional as Theodore. If you're used to seeing him cast as a villain, you might find his performance refreshing. He's vulnerable and rather likable, and it's easy to empathize with the things he experiences. Despite being nominated for Best Picture, Her won't win any awards. But I'm not sure that I've seen a better acting performance all year. Phoenix has to show considerable range in the role, and does it without ever seeming as if he is acting. Amy Adams plays one of the lovable characters that we see in most of her movies, and she's perfectly cast. I could imagine myself spending the rest of my life talking to her character.The movie raises plenty of questions about modern society. What constitutes a real relationship? Is physical contact essential? Can we exist without technology?I found myself thinking of the Ender's Game sequels (Speaker for the Dead, Xenocide, and Children of the Mind) for much of the story. If you have read them, you'll know that Ender's most trusted friend was a computer program that he accessed through a jewel in his ear. His friend Jane is not too dissimilar to Samantha. I urge you to read the whole series if you enjoyed the Ender's Game movie.As the movie ended, the audience quickly filed out, and people began accessing their cell phones. As for me, I rushed home to share my thoughts with you. We live in the virtual world far more than some of us are willing to admit.If you like original ideas, good acting, and thoughtful stories, go and see Her. If you need a fast-paced story with plenty of action, give this one a miss.Overall score 4.5/5",5,Can a relationship be 'real' without the physical aspect?,1389830400,"01 16, 2014",2014,3654,"['very', 'unusual', 'movie', 'interesting', 'observations', 'way', 'people', 'are', 'becoming', 'more', 'reliant', 'technology', 'set', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'not', 'too', 'distant', 'future', 'story', 'Theodore', 'Twombly', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'writer', 'producing', 'flowery', 'love', 'letters', 'people', 'who', 'who', 'lack', 'ability', 'express', 'feelings', 'good', 'job.Unfortunately', 'Theodore', 'own', 'relationship', 'failing', 'soon', 'be', 'divorced', 'wife', 'Catherine', 'Rooney', 'Mara', 'When', 'new', 'computer', 'operating', 'system', 'life', 'changes', 'dramatically', 'program', 'adapts', 'personality', 'needs', 'tremendous', 'rate', 'screen', 'names', 'Samantha', 'voiced', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson.To', 'surprise', 'delight', 'Theodore', 'able', 'connect', 'Samantha', 'ways', 'never', 'could', 'physical', 'person', 'Communication', 'everything', 'relationship', 'easy', 'express', 'deepest', 'thoughts', 'feelings', 'Samantha', 'outset', 'probably', 'form', 'self-analysis', 'relationship', 'clear', 'Samantha', 'real', 'Theodore.I', 'think', 'modern', 'technology', 'microscope', 'movie', 'director', 'Spike', 'Jonze', 'observing', 'how', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'open', 'sharing', 'feelings', 'Internet', 'many', 'are', 'less', 'guarded', 'willing', 'risk', 'revealing', 'secrets', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'do', 'face-to-face', 'certainly', 'true', 'movie', 'also', 'irony', 'Theodore', 'success', 'writing', 'other', 'people', 'feelings', 'struggling', 'communicate', 'own', 'personal', 'life.Theodore', 'best', 'friend', 'Amy', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'only', 'real', 'person', 'comfortable', 'talking', 'things', 'really', 'matter', 'life', 'are', 'kind', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'there', 'other', 'when', 'are', 'most', 'needed', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'listen.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'surprises', ""'ll"", 'stop', 'talking', 'plot', 'story', 'intelligent', 'thoughtful', 'observations', 'Phoenix', 'exceptional', 'Theodore', ""'re"", 'used', 'seeing', 'cast', 'villain', 'might', 'find', 'performance', 'refreshing', 'vulnerable', 'rather', 'likable', 'easy', 'empathize', 'things', 'being', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Her', 'wo', ""n't"", 'win', 'awards', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'better', 'acting', 'performance', 'year', 'Phoenix', 'show', 'considerable', 'range', 'role', 'ever', 'seeming', 'acting', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'one', 'lovable', 'characters', 'see', 'most', 'movies', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'could', 'imagine', 'spending', 'rest', 'life', 'talking', 'character.The', 'movie', 'plenty', 'questions', 'modern', 'society', 'What', 'real', 'relationship', 'physical', 'contact', 'essential', 'Can', 'exist', 'technology', 'found', 'thinking', 'Ender', 'Game', 'sequels', 'Speaker', 'Dead', 'Xenocide', 'Children', 'Mind', 'much', 'story', 'have', 'read', ""'ll"", 'know', 'Ender', 'most', 'trusted', 'friend', 'was', 'computer', 'program', 'accessed', 'jewel', 'ear', 'friend', 'Jane', 'not', 'too', 'dissimilar', 'Samantha', 'urge', 'read', 'whole', 'series', 'enjoyed', 'Ender', 'Game', 'movie.As', 'movie', 'ended', 'audience', 'quickly', 'filed', 'out', 'people', 'began', 'accessing', 'cell', 'phones', 'rushed', 'home', 'share', 'thoughts', 'live', 'virtual', 'world', 'far', 'more', 'are', 'willing', 'admit.If', 'original', 'ideas', 'good', 'acting', 'thoughtful', 'stories', 'go', 'see', 'Her', 'need', 'fast-paced', 'story', 'plenty', 'action', 'give', 'one', 'miss.Overall', 'score', '4.5/5']",N/A

1686543,A26MJME9IBNETY,B00H9HZGQ0,StrangePegs,"[12, 16]","On the surface, Her is a love story. Under the surface, it's also a love story, but it's not just a love story. Not a love story in the way that we think of love stories. There's no boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl, boy-gets-girl-back in this. It's more of an exploration about relationships than anything else, but it does it in a fascinating and unique way.Theodore Twombly, played by Joaquin Phoenix, is a letter writer. That's his job. He writes letters for people to other people for a company called (something like) Hand-written Letters. This letter writing that he does is, in many ways, a metaphor for the entire movie as the letters are personal letters, sometimes love letters, that he's hired to write (and, in some cases, has been writing for the same people for years and years and knows them extremely well), but he dictates the letters to his computer and they are printed out to look as if they are written by hand.It's unclear within the context of the movie whether the people receiving the letters know they are written by a third party, but I have a hard time believing that they wouldn't know this since the whole letter writing thing is a &#34;thing.&#34; Basically, Theodore facilitates other people's relationships by filling these letters with, what I'll call, manufactured emotions, but he can't maintain his own relationships, which is something we find out at the very beginning of the movie, so no spoiler there. He's in the middle of a divorce with his wife and is distant from his friends.Now, there will be spoiler issues in the rest of this.With all of that in mind, it is no surprise that Theodore easily finds himself slipping into a relationship with his new Operating System, the first OS with artificial intelligence. As his wife accuses him later, he can't do relationships with people that are right there in front of him. It's probably why he's so good at the letter writing. And he is good at the letter writing, one of the best, at least. It's no surprise that he finds himself attracted to this physically distant intelligence.But it does open the door to exploring the idea of &#34;what is a relationship?&#34; What is required for a relationship to be legitimate? Is his love real? Is Samantha's (the OS)? Does she need a body in order to manifest the relationship? And it's not just him, because we get pieces of information in the movie that other people in society are dealing with the same struggles. Or the opposite struggles, as we learn that at least one user has a real hate relationship with his OS.The movie doesn't really try to answer these questions, which is good. It just shows us that the questions are there and should be considered. Although there are a few concrete answers, one of which is that, at least sometimes, we do need the physical presence of another person. Especially in dealing with loss.Joaquin Phoenix was great as Theodore. It's a very subdued performance, because Theodore is a very subdued individual. I think performances like this get overlooked because they're not outrageous, but Phoenix is much more believable in his role than, say, DiCaprio as Belfort, which is not to take away from DiCaprio's performance, but I think it's easy to look at a movie like The Wolf of Wall Street and think, &#34;Wow, he was amazing&#34; but forget about roles like Theodore Twombly which rely on conveying emotion rather than exaggerated action. Phoenix was superb at conveying the emotion of Twombly.Even more amazing, though, was Scarlett Johansson. Everything she did was conveyed through voice only, and it was incredible. I don't think I've really given her a lot of credit in the past for her acting ability, which is not to say that I didn't think she was good; I just didn't think she was, well, better. It's too easy with her to think, &#34;Oh, she got this part because of her looks,&#34; and not really credit her for the actual acting. But she's not physically in this movie, and what she did with her voice shows that she is better. She didn't even have the help of animators to convey her emotion; she just had to bring it audibly, and she did. It is actually upsetting to me that she has been dismissed from the Oscar nominations because she wasn't physically in the movie. That's just wrong.Her is a great movie. It's a thoughtful movie. There are no explosions or car chases or alien invasions. It's sci-fi that could happen.

1686553,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B00H9HZGQ0,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[0, 0]","&#8220;Her&#8221; is an odd romantic comedy set in Los Angeles in the near future. Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) works for a company called beautifulhandwrittenletters.com composing intimate letters and notes of love, desire, loss and other heartfelt emotions for people who are too busy to express their thoughts themselves. Ironically, no hand ever touches a pen. The letters are composed on the computer in script.Though he is very good at pouring out Hallmark card-style expressions at work, Theodore has trouble with his own relationships. His wife, Catherine (Rooney Mara), has left him and Theodore is pretty much alone until he buys a new operating system for his computer with built-in artificial intelligence -- a disembodied voice (of Scarlett Johansson) called Samantha.Samantha initially helps organize Theodore&#8217;s online files and reminds him of appointments but soon is able to pick up emotions in Theodore&#8217;s voice and sense his moods. Turning into a sort of in-home therapist, she begins to have conversations, offer opinions, ask questions, and take a personal interest in Theodore.Director Spike Jonze has combined romantic comedy/drama with science fiction to come up with one of the most original and strangest movies in a long time. Visually, he provides an ultra-modern Los Angeles (Shanghai stands in for L.A.) where people walk around with their heads buried in portable tech devices -- an apt metaphor for a detached society.Mr. Phoenix is an interesting choice as the lead. Were he an A-list star, he might have trouble selling his character. We know his face from his body of work, but he comes off as one of the crowd -- a guy who does his job each day, then has to face an evening with little to do and no one to share it with. Because his life is devoid of any real relationship, he bonds with Samantha, surprised at her ability to learn quickly, access information in milliseconds, and display a sense of humor. Theodore becomes so obsessed with Samantha that he carries a small camera so she can see moment to moment what he is doing. In this future, a simple earpiece is all it takes to get online, so Samantha is there whenever he wants her. Phoenix plays the reclusive Theodore with just the right amount of awkwardness, so we get it when he opens up to Samantha.Once the film&#8217;s setting is established and we see Theodore&#8217;s sad life, we accept that he responds to Samantha&#8217;s human-like qualities. He is in a relationship without the responsibilities a human-to-human bond entails. Samantha is there at his convenience and for his convenience. He likes this arrangement and the relationship develops in odd and then bizarre ways.Ms. Johansson does an amazing job with only a vocal performance, and listening to her throaty, warm voice, we can see why Theodore regards Samantha as more than a mere operating system. Her delicate performance makes believable the intimacy of the relationship that develops.Amy Adams appears as Amy, Theodore&#8217;s neighbor. They meet in the elevator on the way to or from work and exchange pleasantries. This is the only real human-to-human relationship Theodore has. Eventually the two become arm&#8217;s-length confidantes and discuss their lives with cool objectivity. Only when a crisis arises do they connect in more than a superficial manner.Science fiction movies often underplay ideas in favor of special effects. In &#8220;Her,&#8221; director Jonze makes his Los Angeles look just different enough that we accept it as the future. He avoids gadgetry, even though the premise of the movie relies on technoloy. His theme of human detachment is what grabs us and keeps us involved. Once the story kicks in, we become immersed in its quirkiness and unpredictability.Rated R, &#8220;Her&#8221; is an audacious, brave romantic comedy that defies whatever you might think a movie romance should be.

1686554,ALJLONJXLA3OQ,B00H9HZGQ0,The People's Critic,"[9, 13]","If I didn&#8217;t know any better, I&#8217;d swear that every time Spike Jonze releases a movie, he&#8217;s targeting me as his core audience type.  When Being John Malkovich came out, I was studying film at the University of Michigan and attended a free campus screening of the film; Ann Arbor film majors ate that film up!  When Adaptation came out, I had just begun struggling to write my first and still as of yet unfinished novel.  Where the Wild Things Are was one of my favorite children&#8217;s books growing up.  Now with Her, he takes aim at my self-proclaimed geekdom with a film about a man who literally falls in love with his technology.  The only problem is that while it seems like every one of those films should have been suited just for me, for one reason or another, I only really liked Adaptation.  Fortunately, it seems like Jonze and I are back in alignment as Her is one of the most imaginative love stories since Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.Her stars Joaquin Phoenix as the odd and appropriately named Theodore Twombly, a name that practically invokes the characters of Dr. Seuss.  This very well could be Jonze&#8217;s intention, as Her succeeds more as a fantasy children&#8217;s tale for adults than Where the Wild Things Are ever did.  Set in the very near future, Twombly works for the web company, beautifulhandwrittenletters.com where he is paid to weave the events of real couples&#8217; lives into artistically poetic love letters that are then sent unbeknownst to their recipients.The irony is palpable as Twombly&#8217;s personal life is still reeling from his recent divorce, even to the point of sabotaging a sure thing with a prospective lover, played by Olivia Wilde.  Instead, Twombly spends his evenings playing holographic video games and remembering what his life was like when he was happily married.  Enter Samantha ( voiced by Scarlet Johansson), the whimsically playful voice of his new computer operating system, designed to exist as a consciousness that is so intuitive that it understands and knows you on a virtually human level.  It is with Samantha that Twombly is able to open up and real feelings of passion, love, and connection soon follow.Jonze has written and directed a fine hypothetical commentary on love in a modern world.  Never has the question, &#8220;Can romantic love exist in a vacuum?&#8221; been so cinematically explored.  What should feel absurd and ridiculous is made to feel thoughtful and reluctantly authentic thanks to pitch perfect performances from Phoenix and Johansson.  In one scene where Samantha attempts to physicalize their relationship in a very creative but creepy way, the film achieves true greatness in the style of warped kind of Frankenstein story.Jonze truly has created a monster here, and it is one that is surprisingly refreshing, creative, and tonally apprehensive.  There is no doubt that if Apple announced tomorrow that it is releasing the OS1, thousands of people would be blindly grinning through the streets as they share their deepest thoughts and secrets with their virtual lovers.  Stories already exist of people who abandon their lives to live fake lives in virtual worlds like World of Warcraft or Second Life.  Jonze puts a magnifying glass on this idea and shows us how close we are to shutting ourselves into this type of cocoon-like existence.Keeping this film from completely falling down the rabbit hole is Amy Adams as Twombly&#8217;s friend and neighbor, Amy, another symbolic name &#8211; because it&#8217;s REAL!  Adams continues her quest to be the female Kevin Bacon (more on that in my American Hustle review), but she also grounds this film and prevents it from getting too far in the disbelief column.  Her is a cautionary fairy tale that is effortlessly engaging and easily Jonze&#8217;s best film yet.  A-Her is rated R and has a running time of 2 hours.

I have to begin by saying that I really enjoyed this movie. It was very original and entertaining. I thought Matthew McConaughey was the most deserving of the Best Actor Oscar...until I watched this. Joaquin Phoenix was amazing in this and he basically did it all by himself with only an off screen voice as his supporting cast. All that said the movie also really makes you think about the subject matter and how far off we really are to this technology. I do also have to say that the movie may be a little too good at foreshadowing in the way that human interaction due to the new OS's becomes even worse then it is now. Scenes of people walking by one another without acknowledging another human because they are talking to their OS isn't really that far off from what is happening now.

1686563,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00H9HZGQ0,Turfseer,"[1, 2]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Rating: 3.5 out of 5.0Spike Jonze's 'Her' has a touch of Asimov-inspired sci-fi but it's much more 'rom-com' overall. Set in the not so distant future, what I like about Jonze's vision is that it's quite plausible. There are no flying cars or aliens walking around but rather people even more addicted to their computers. The protagonist is Theodore Twombly (nicely played by a low key Joaquin Phoenix) who works as a copywriter of intimate correspondence for people unable to compose original tomes themselves. Twombly purchases the latest computer operating system (OS) infused with artificial intelligence. He assigns a female voice to his 'companion' who initially is designed to organize his day. But soon the artificial companion names herself 'Samantha' and proves to be quite engaging, becoming Twombly's confidante and 'lover' of sorts. Twombly in turns falls completely for his virtual girlfriend, and finds himself reacting less with human companions.'Her' really is a robot without any corporeality. Normally, this would be a distraction since having only one person interacting with a voice-over does not work very well visually in a film. However, the dialogue that Jonze has written for Samantha is excellent and it's delivered impeccably by Scarlet Johannson (interestingly enough, the film was originally shot using actress Samantha Morton's voice but Jonze decided Johansson was far more effective in the role).Although Jonze's idea of an operating system suffused with artificial intelligence is a clever one, it becomes apparent that the premise itself cannot carry an entire movie. Instead, the artificial relationship between Twombly and Samantha evolves into a satirical peek at how a relationship between two humans rises and falls. At first Samantha is completely supportive as Twombly confides in her about his impending divorce to his wife, Catherine, as well as going out on a failed date with an attractive woman he meets online. Later, they have a verbal sexual encounter and soon Samantha suggests utilizing an actual human surrogate to enhance their relationship. Twombly is unable to pretend with a stranger (Isbabella) who attempts to make love to him as Samantha whispers in his ear. Twombly begins to have his doubts about continuing with Samantha but his good friend Amy, encourages him to try and make a go of it, as she also has broken up with her husband and is now also interacting with another OS with artificial intelligence.The relationship between Twombly and Samantha has a real ring of truth to it and reminds me of some of French director Eric Rohmer's films that dissect the complex relationships between men and women. Like Rohmer's artful narratives, some may find Jonze's dissection to be a tad bit lugubrious but for those who are patient, epiphanies can be uncovered, if one cares to look for them.There is also some tension in Jonze's plot, as we're also still waiting to find out how Jonze resolves his tale between man and machine. The ending is a comic one when Samantha reveals that she's met another operating system based on the mind of a famous physicist, who she falls for. Before you know it, Samantha admits to Twombly that she's been talking with 8,316 others, of whom she has fallen in love with 641.Samantha has no choice but to 'move on', leaving Twombly and Amy to commiserate with one another. The ending should be considered a relatively happy one in that Twombly has been apparently cured of his artificial intelligence infatuation and will probably be spending more time with humans in the foreseeable future. This could have been a much more dark, 'hit you over the head' type of film, with Jonze pointing out the dangers of modern day man being seduced by ever improving technology. Fortunately, he refuses to take such a route and opts for verisimilitude. Even an OS (echoing her human counterpart), is not adverse to embracing 'change'.Ultimately, Jonze's initial premise of an artificial being evolving into something a lot more human, is really a one note idea. It's the relationship that develops between the two principals that hooks us to the end. Phoenix is really playing the 'straight man' here and it's Johannson, with her changing moods, that gives the film its broad flavor. As mentioned before, the compelling dialogue compensates for the lack of visual impact, when Phoenix and Johannson interact.Something still must be said for the cinematography which creates a vision of the future which is not that much different than today. Jonze's 'Her' indeed is a cautionary tale but with the sagacious Samantha, there appears to be hope for humanity. Ironically, humans here don't take the lead; it's the machines--I feel sure that Samantha will ultimately end up with her 'equal', leaving humans to fend for themselves.",3,"'Rohmer' meets 'Asimov' as

Most of the one star reviews are a few lines long, and many are littered with misspelling and incorrect punctuation.  Many of them miss the entire point of the movie.  A few are more thoughtful and object to the premise, at least those reviewers are up front about why they did not like the movie.  However, it is clear that many of the one star reviewers expected a romantic comedy or were unable to follow the premise of the film.My fourteen year old convinced me to see this film.  I expected it to be trite.  It was not.  It generated a two hour long conversation covering what it means to &#8220;love&#8221; someone, if it is possible to love a person only for their intellect and the moral implications of artificial intelligence.Note that this movie is rated R, and this is solely for sex.  The sex is not graphic in the sense that you see body parts or heavy action.  However, some of the sex is crude in that it does not involve emotional involvement and it mentions some fairly strange fetishes.I have no objection to my kids seeing sex in movies.  While someday I hope for sex to be part of their lives, I would hope violence will never be.  It is clear that US ratings are higher for sex than for violence, whereas in European movies it is considered fine for there to be nudity in a movie for teens, but not extreme violence.

It's a movie about the human need to connect.Set a few decades ahead of 2014, HER is about a society that is in touch with technology.  If you think it's bad now with everyone's telephone in their face, you've seen nothing yet.  Society is technology hyped, though I can't say that the fashions have evolved much in the movie.Basically, it's about a man going through a divorce, who is lonely and broken. His dating endeavors have not been going well.  Theodore finds it hard to connect and open up to anyone - even his former wife.  However, when he's given the opportunity to buy the latest technology - an OS (operating system) - his life changes.Just think about it.  A perfectly programmed mate for your life made just for you.  You can choose a male or female voice.  The system grows, adapts and learns everything about you.  And while doing so, it evolves to discover what it means to be human by getting in touch with its own electronic ""feelings"" if you will.Theodore finds Samantha (his OS) easy to talk to.  They go places together.  He walks, she's in his shirt pocket. They explore the world, talk, keep each other company, and have make believe sex.  She tells him that she is in love, and Theodore has fallen in love with HER.Well, it's a complex relationship. At one point he almost walks away because of the absurdity of it all. It's obvious he has trouble with human relationships, so should he pursue the electronic ones instead?  After a brief struggle, he throws all caution to the wind.  However, even like real relationships, it ends in heartbreak after he learns that Samantha is not a one-guy OS.  In fact, she has over 8,000 other companions and declares love to over 600.  Talk about fickle! Of course, the news devastates Theodore, and in the end, the OS's evolve and abandon humans for their own kind (or at least that's what I got out of it).It's a strange movie, but it is filled with the honesty of struggling to be a single and sole individual who has a deep need to connect.  If one can't connect humanly, then companionship can be found electronically.  However, I strongly believe that our society is becoming disconnected because of technology.  Our phones are in our faces, along with computers, iPads, Kindles, and every other device that we use to get lost in, so we can depart from the human race.  Rather than giving us a stronger society, it is giving us a society that connects through electricity, but cannot connect humanly.If you're single, I think you would enjoy and relate.  Joaquin Phoenix is brilliant.  Absolutely brilliant and heartfelt through the entire movie.  He's a man who wants to be loved and accepted.  And if that love comes from an operating system named Samantha that understands him more than any other thing on this earth, then so be it.That is HER.

Know whether sticking out with the one you physically love or is better off or not than the one you become attached to via technology? Could the film be a metaphor for online dating, phone sex, or a propaganda piece for those two things?Her, Spike Jonze's experimental and Charlie Brooker's Black Mirror-inspired romance, is a quiet, mild-mannered, and potentially thought-provoking look into how man and technology can correspond and have a relationship together in the face of adversity and loneliness.It examines the look of a man named Theodore (played by a confident, not so smug Joaquin Phoenix), a vocal (seems keyboards are a thing of the past in the future) letter-writer, who evokes an eccentric hipster chic about him as he settles through a divorce with his wife only to find escapism and compatibility one moment and thereafter with an operating system (OS) named Samantha voiced by every Joe or Bob's favourite, Scarlett Johansson.Her, as a whole, manages to be a neat and safe ride but it does have its lack of thrills when the film boils down more to a conventional romantic plotline than a sort-of satirical take on &#34;phone love&#34; and &#34;technological obsession&#34; (this is notable during the gaming sequences and one phone sex scene which has, undoubtedly, an offensive and disgusting joke involving three sexually deviant acts not appropriate to said on here) but that does not mean it is not realistic enough. The emotions and catharsis feels believable and far beyond the hokey cues one may find in a generic romance.I liked what Jonze (who is known to be a &#34;music video&#34; director) did with the design and location by creating an environment not so futuristic and believable (even if Shanghai is mixed along with Los Angeles in several shots which is peculiar and non-projectioned screens with finger-oriented gaming and voice-automated smartphones are still in development) and what he did with the whole theme of the film by making it stand out from a wave of Oscar bait and romantic films that are usually filled with gushy tears and recycled plotlines found on Lifetime.Romance is a tricky game of sorts as I usually abstain from getting into any kind of affair, kiss, or sexual encounter of sorts and this film's technology-oriented premise and peculiar characters (Phoenix and Johansson that is) stood out for me also knowing that I have seen things which deals with similar themes like Black Mirror, the Kate Bush music video Deeper Understanding, and some episodes of Dexter's Laboratory. The others here including Amy Adams and Rooney Mara provide well-rounded performances as the encounters Theodore explores especially during the scenes where Adams' character who is a filmmaker and video game designer tries to showcase her documentary about sleep and a quirky game which involves a mother trying to be &#34;perfect.&#34; There are some believably funny scenes and none of it feels forced or too eccentric to where I may find the whole hipster chic of it (which Jonze's fanbase mostly consists of) annoying and pretentious too much.The Black Mirror connection is not explicit but a possible inspiration for the script and execution of the film as Black Mirror utilises technology within its everyday look at lifestyles or near-by futures or dystopias to show how over-the-top matters of life could get. The differences here is that Black Mirror allowed to explore several subjects as a TV series and its technology-gone-mad angle is a lot more darker and bleaker than Her.If more and more people were more like Theodore, I think the problem of overpopulation, divorce rates, infidelity, domestic violence, negligence towards children and women, and other relative issues maybe diminished while the focus of these issues may pertain but on a less crucial and problematic level like now. My futuristic observations maybe controversial and wrong but I wish Jonze would deliver some of these questions more into the film but the film as a whole was not terrible but felt a bit stretched and exhaustive more than I could ask for but nonetheless, the realistic parameters and treatment of love, the idiosyncrasy, and occasional humour stood out and it was altogether a respectable but not phenomenal film like how most of the critics put it out.Her is not science-fiction (in the same sense as something like THX 1138 which some of the set designs might be based off for this film, Bicentennial Man, or Close Encounters of the Third Kind) but its aims are a bit futuristic at the moment but may come across some point in time around in the 2020s?&#34;",3,"Techno-romance in the age of Siri, Facetime, and Dragon speech software.

I'm so glad I did.  This isn't your average whiny love story.  In fact it's more about the spiritual evolution of beings.  Since the love object doesn't have a body, we are asked to see beyond physical evolution and focus primarily on spiritual and emotional evolution... and what happens in a relationship when one person evolves and grows much faster than the other person or when one person is simply unwilling to accept the growth and changes that occur in themselves or their partner over time.  This film touches on so many things that will feel familiar to anyone who's been in long term relationships.  I myself found the rift between Theodore and his wife painfully familiar.  I was in a relationship for many years.  When I first met this individual, I was mostly happy and care-free.  However over-time I had encountered difficult things in my life that made me more vulnerable and not so care-free.  Instead of this person accepting that and trying to be there for me so that I could go through it and survive; instead they insisted that shove my real feelings away and pretend everything was fine and happy, so that I could be the person this person used to know.  It's a selfish way to be because you want the person to deny who they now really are and how they feel just so they can be what you want and need, while giving that person nothing of what that they want and need.  Many people have either been on one or both ends of that scenerio in a relationship.  In this film we watch Theodore struggle through a divorce where it appears he was unwilling to accept his wife's evolution and preferred she put up an act rather than accept her growth.  Then we see him engage in another relationship where his partner - an advanced artificial intelligence- evolves much faster than is possible for human beings.  As the OS evolves we come across spiritual ideas as the computers become almost god-like with the ability to expand their love to many people at once.  It's really an AMAZING film and if you're not in the mood for something with this kind of depth I suggest you watch it when you are because otherwise you'll really be missing out on something special.",5,"I'm not into romance flicks, but this film was different",1404604800,"07 6, 2014",2014,2358,"[""'m"", 'not', 'what', 'would', 'call', 'romantic', 'do', ""n't"", 'generally', 'like', 'films', 'romance', 'genre', 'wanted', 'give', 'try', 'so', 'many', 'critics', 'gave', 'outstanding', 'reviews', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'average', 'whiny', 'love', 'story', 'fact', 'more', 'spiritual', 'evolution', 'beings', 'love', 'object', ""n't"", 'have', 'body', 'are', 'asked', 'see', 'physical', 'evolution', 'focus', 'primarily', 'spiritual', 'emotional', 'evolution', 'what', 'relationship', 'when', 'one', 'person', 'evolves', 'grows', 'much', 'faster', 'other', 'person', 'when', 'one', 'person', 'simply', 'unwilling', 'accept', 'growth', 'changes', 'occur', 'partner', 'time', 'film', 'touches', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'will', 'feel', 'familiar', 'anyone', 'who', 'been', 'long', 'term', 'relationships', 'found', 'rift', 'Theodore', 'wife', 'painfully', 'familiar', 'was', 'relationship', 'many', 'years', 'When', 'first', 'met', 'individual', 'was', 'mostly', 'happy', 'care-free', 'However', 'over-time', 'had', 'encountered', 'difficult', 'things', 'life', 'made', 'more', 'vulnerable', 'not', 'so', 'care-free', 'Instead', 'person', 'accepting', 'trying', 'be', 'there', 'could', 'go', 'survive', 'instead', 'insisted', 'shove', 'real', 'feelings', 'away', 'pretend', 'everything', 'was', 'fine', 'happy', 'could', 'be', 'person', 'person', 'used', 'know', 'selfish', 'way', 'be', 'want', 'person', 'deny', 'who', 'now', 'really', 'are', 'how', 'feel', 'just', 'can', 'be', 'what', 'want', 'need', 'giving', 'person', 'nothing', 'what', 'want', 'need', 'Many', 'people', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'ends', 'scenerio', 'relationship', 'film', 'watch', 'Theodore', 'struggle', 'divorce', 'where', 'was', 'unwilling', 'accept', 'wife', 'evolution', 'preferred', 'put', 'up', 'act', 'rather', 'accept', 'growth', 'Then', 'see', 'engage', 'relationship', 'where', 'partner', 'advanced', 'artificial', 'intelligence-', 'evolves', 'much', 'faster', 'possible', 'human', 'beings', 'OS', 'come', 'spiritual', 'ideas', 'computers', 'become', 'almost', 'god-like', 'ability', 'expand', 'love', 'many', 'people', 'once', 'really', 'AMAZING', 'film', ""'re"", 'not', 'mood', 'something', 'kind', 'depth', 'suggest', 'watch', 'when', 'are', 'otherwise', ""'ll"", 'really', 'be', 'missing', 'out', 'something', 'special']",N/A

We have iPhones, speech recognition, great advances in AI, the permanently plugged in generation, Watson, Suri, and Amazon or Netflix predicting your preferences based on history. It's hardly a surprise that the voice in the box gets smarter, more responsive, and more adaptable to the user's expressed interests, and it's increasingly natural to expect that voice to be with you at all times. That's where the movie starts - almost aSimonefor everyone, tailored to the individual, everywhere, all the time.We also have Asimov'sThree Laws.

1686574,AP3B615GM191G,B00H9HZGQ0,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[12, 16]","The &#34;hook&#34; that drew me to see &#34;Her&#34; in theaters was simple: the interesting &#34;man falls in love with smart-phone&#34; plot that was advertised in the trailers.  While viewing the film, however, I discovered that this is a much deeper movie than I ever thought possible, dealing with the true nature of relationships and the very essence of humanity itself.For a basic plot summary, &#34;Her&#34; (set in an unknown future year) focuses on the character of Theodore Twombley (Joaquin Phoenix).  Theodore is an extreme introvert who, despite having the skill to create loving &#34;couples notes&#34; as a profession, is completely lost in the real world of relationships.  Amy (Amy Adams) is basically the only person in the world that he can be himself around, and even she is &#34;taken&#34;.  As such, Theodore purchases a new computer operating system (voiced by Scarlett Johansson) that is basically &#34;Siri X 1,000&#34;.  An unintended result of the new operating system (in this case named Samantha) is that many users find themselves becoming romantically involved with the artificial intelligence.  This is exactly what happens to Theodore Twombley.Like I said, what initially drew me into this movie was the more science fiction-esque &#34;man falls in love with smart-phone&#34; concept.  In this day-and-age of Hollywood sequels and repeated ideas, I found it refreshing that an entirely and completely original concept was at play here.What I did not foresee, though, was just how &#34;deep&#34; this movie would go in describing the essence of relationships.  &#34;Her&#34; has to walk a very fine film-making line because its entire concept often times seems utterly ridiculous (how can a person ever fall in love with a computer?!).  However, every single time the viewer may even have a moment where they think that, the movie proves that the emotions could indeed happen and be very real.  Again and again in the theater, I kept thinking that certain events were going to transpire, only to be surprised (in a very pleasant fashion) at how different and unique situations actually played out.Basically, this is the type of movie that &#34;thinking people&#34; (and I mean the REAL deep ponderers) will revel in.  If you are looking for action or adventure, look elsewhere or be severely disappointed.  Instead, &#34;Her&#34; is about subtlety and frank discussions of romantic relationships and emotions.  Yet, at the same time, it isn't so over-complicated that it turns into psychological mumbo-jumbo either.Overall, then, I can see why &#34;Her&#34; was nominated for &#34;Best Picture&#34; at the 2014 Academy Awards.  It should, IMHO, win &#34;Best Original Screenplay&#34; in a cinch.  In fact, the only reason it can't be a serious contender for the bigger awards is because, at times, director Spike Jones gets really weird (some scenes are quite bizarre and maybe are even a little out of place in such a thoughtful treatise).  Other than that, though, &#34;Her&#34; is a gem for the &#34;thinkers&#34; among us; those who loved to be challenge in the cinema while also being entertained.",4,The Nature of Humanity & Relationships,1391299200,"02 2, 2014",2014,3135,"['34', 'hook', '34', 'drew', 'see', '34', 'Her', '34', 'theaters', 'was', 'simple', 'interesting', '34', 'man', 'love', 'smart-phone', '34', 'plot', 'was', 'advertised', 'trailers', 'viewing', 'film', 'however', 'discovered', 'much', 'deeper', 'movie', 'ever', 'thought', 'possible', 'dealing', 'true', 'nature', 'relationships', 'very', 'essence', 'humanity', 'itself.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', '34', 'Her', '34', 'set', 'unknown', 'future', 'year', 'character', 'Theodore', 'Twombley', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Theodore', 'extreme', 'introvert', 'who', 'having', 'skill', 'create', 'loving', '34', 'couples', '34', 'profession', 'completely', 'lost', 'real', 'world', 'relationships', 'Amy', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'basically', 'only', 'person', 'world', 'can', 'be', 'even', '34', 'taken', '34', 'such', 'Theodore', 'purchases', 'new', 'computer', 'operating', 'system', 'voiced', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'basically', '34', 'Siri', 'X', '1,000', '34', 'unintended', 'result', 'new', 'operating', 'system', 'case', 'named', 'Samantha', 'many', 'users', 'find', 'becoming', 'romantically', 'involved', 'artificial', 'intelligence', 'exactly', 'what', 'Theodore', 'Twombley.Like', 'said', 'what', 'initially', 'drew', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'science', 'fiction-esque', '34', 'man', 'love', 'smart-phone', '34', 'concept', 'day-and-age', 'Hollywood', 'sequels', 'repeated', 'ideas', 'found', 'refreshing', 'entirely', 'completely', 'original', 'concept', 'was', 'play', 'here.What', 'did', 'not', 'foresee', 'was', 'just', 'how', '34', 'deep', '34', 'movie', 'would', 'go', 'describing', 'essence', 'relationships', '34', 'Her', '34', 'walk', 'very', 'fine', 'film-making', 'line', 'entire', 'concept', 'often', 'utterly', 'ridiculous', 'how', 'can', 'person', 'ever', 'fall', 'love', 'computer', 'However', 'single', 'time', 'viewer', 'may', 'even', 'have', 'moment', 'where', 'think', 'movie', 'emotions', 'could', 'indeed', 'happen', 'be', 'very', 'real', 'Again', 'again', 'theater', 'kept', 'thinking', 'certain', 'events', 'were', 'going', 'transpire', 'only', 'be', 'surprised', 'very', 'pleasant', 'fashion', 'how', 'different', 'unique', 'situations', 'actually', 'played', 'out.Basically', 'type', 'movie', '34', 'thinking', 'people', '34', 'mean', 'REAL', 'deep', 'ponderers', 'will', 'revel', 'are', 'looking', 'action', 'adventure', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'be', 'severely', 'disappointed', 'Instead', '34', 'Her', '34', 'subtlety', 'frank', 'discussions', 'romantic', 'relationships', 'emotions', 'same', 'time', ""n't"", 'so', 'over-complicated', 'psychological', 'mumbo-jumbo', 'either.Overall', 'then', 'can', 'see', 'why', '34', 'Her', '34', 'was', 'nominated', '34', 'Best', 'Picture', '34', '2014', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'should', 'IMHO', 'win', '34', 'Best', 'Original', 'Screenplay', '34', 'cinch', 'fact', 'only', 'reason', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'serious', 'contender', 'bigger', 'awards', 'times', 'director', 'Spike', 'Jones', 'really', 'weird', 'scenes', 'are', 'quite', 'bizarre', 'maybe', 'are', 'even', 'little', 'place', 'such', 'thoughtful', 'treatise', 'Other', 'though', '34', 'Her', '34', 'gem', '34', 'thinkers', '34', 'who', 'loved', 'be', 'challenge', 'cinema', 'also', 'being', 'entertained']",N/A
