1570310,A2X29H96X7C3XJ,B008MB1FQ2,"Blue in Washington ""Barry Ballow""","[1, 1]","Entertaining political satire with a distinctive Swedish flavor.  A high-ranking and popular 40-something politician takes a shot at the country's premiership, but is undercut in national elections by the poor performance of an allied party.  He's out politically and somehow liberated personally.  That sense of liberty leads an unexpected attraction to another man--who happens to be a political enemy and openly gay.  The budding new romance and subsequent coming out have predictable zig-zags as the newly out pol finds himself with a lot to reconcile.This is a story told with deft humor and honesty.  The principal actors are believable in their physical ordinariness and humanity.  They behave first and foremost like politicians (or so it seems to this denizen of Washington DC) and this makes their personal lives all the more complicated and amusing.",4,Fine Swedish comedy,1385078400,"11 22, 2013",2013,860,"['Entertaining', 'political', 'satire', 'distinctive', 'Swedish', 'flavor', 'high-ranking', 'popular', '40-something', 'politician', 'shot', 'country', 'premiership', 'undercut', 'national', 'elections', 'poor', 'performance', 'allied', 'party', 'out', 'politically', 'somehow', 'liberated', 'personally', 'sense', 'liberty', 'unexpected', 'attraction', 'man', 'who', 'be', 'political', 'enemy', 'openly', 'gay', 'budding', 'new', 'romance', 'subsequent', 'coming', 'out', 'have', 'predictable', 'zig-zags', 'newly', 'out', 'pol', 'finds', 'lot', 'reconcile.This', 'story', 'told', 'deft', 'humor', 'honesty', 'principal', 'actors', 'are', 'believable', 'physical', 'ordinariness', 'humanity', 'behave', 'first', 'foremost', 'politicians', 'so', 'denizen', 'Washington', 'DC', 'personal', 'lives', 'more', 'complicated', 'amusing']",N/A

1570312,A18P0T2NZTGWYX,B008MB1FQ2,J. Martin,"[1, 2]","Four More Years is the lighthearted and charming story of a forty-something Swedish politician named David, the leader of a political party, whose wife Fia is his chief aide and adviser.In the aftermath of a disastrous election, which instead of making him Prime Minister as expected loses his party almost all its influence in parliament, David falls in love with Martin, a younger, openly gay leader of the opposition party that trounced David's in the election. (The movie was directed by the actress who plays Fia.) There follows anAdam's Ribsort of dilemma, with lovers on opposite sides of a professional matter of great importance to both - in addition to David's anxiety over coming out as gay.Americans and other Anglophones may have a hard time believing politicians of opposing parties ANYWHERE can treat each other with unfailing mild-mannered courtesy, but it may well be true that Swedish politicians actually are civilized human beings, unlike the snarling savages who dominate American politics.And gay American men may not recognize the intensity of the passion between David and Martin. I think the two guys are very sexy, both individually and together, but viewers conditioned by the hairless twenty-something gym bunnies and feral copulation that distinguish American gay movies will find these two men unattractive.Anybody looking for fireworks - either political or sexual - will be disappointed in this movie; but as a look at how civilized, mature (but not old) gay men with serious interests outside of themselves might behave, Four More Years is a revelation and a welcome breath of fresh air in the world of gay movies.All the performances are good, the dialog is intelligent, the story is not as predictable as it could be, and there are some very entertaining supporting characters - particularly David's mother and Martin's father. I enjoyed the movie enough to watch it again right now.",4,Politicians who are civilized AND gay - obviously NOT made in the USA,1390608000,"01 25, 2014",2014,1918,"['Four', 'More', 'Years', 'lighthearted', 'charming', 'story', 'forty-something', 'Swedish', 'politician', 'named', 'David', 'leader', 'political', 'party', 'wife', 'Fia', 'chief', 'aide', 'adviser.In', 'aftermath', 'disastrous', 'election', 'instead', 'making', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'expected', 'party', 'almost', 'influence', 'parliament', 'David', 'love', 'Martin', 'younger', 'openly', 'gay', 'leader', 'opposition', 'party', 'trounced', 'David', 'election', 'movie', 'was', 'directed', 'actress', 'who', 'Fia', 'anAdam', 'Ribsort', 'dilemma', 'lovers', 'opposite', 'sides', 'professional', 'matter', 'great', 'importance', 'addition', 'David', 'anxiety', 'coming', 'out', 'gay.Americans', 'other', 'Anglophones', 'may', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'believing', 'politicians', 'opposing', 'parties', 'ANYWHERE', 'can', 'treat', 'other', 'unfailing', 'mild-mannered', 'courtesy', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'true', 'Swedish', 'politicians', 'actually', 'are', 'civilized', 'human', 'beings', 'snarling', 'savages', 'who', 'dominate', 'American', 'politics.And', 'gay', 'American', 'men', 'may', 'not', 'recognize', 'intensity', 'passion', 'David', 'Martin', 'think', 'two', 'guys', 'are', 'very', 'sexy', 'individually', 'together', 'viewers', 'conditioned', 'hairless', 'twenty-something', 'gym', 'bunnies', 'feral', 'copulation', 'distinguish', 'American', 'gay', 'movies', 'will', 'find', 'two', 'men', 'unattractive.Anybody', 'looking', 'fireworks', 'political', 'sexual', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'look', 'how', 'civilized', 'mature', 'not', 'old', 'men', 'serious', 'interests', 'might', 'behave', 'Four', 'More', 'Years', 'revelation', 'welcome', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'world', 'gay', 'movies.All', 'performances', 'are', 'good', 'dialog', 'intelligent', 'story', 'not', 'as', 'predictable', 'could', 'be', 'are', 'very', 'entertaining', 'supporting', 'characters', 'particularly', 'David', 'mother', 'Martin', 'father', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'enough', 'watch', 'again', 'right', 'now']",N/A

1570314,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B008MB1FQ2,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[11, 11]","This is simply a fantastic  film, sort of a `Thick of It'' in Sweden but with a gay love story thrown in. It is all about next Prime Minister to be David Holst (Bjorn Kjellmann). He is happily married to his job as Party Chairman of the Liberal Democrats, brought up as a Baptist he was taught to believe that most fun things were wrong, causing him to indulge in a life of denial including punitive masturbation (that is think of someone ugly while you're doing it). After his election goes south he has to rebuild the party from the ground up and starts to look at things a bit differently.Then he runs into the stalking horse of the Socialists Martin, and as such sworn enemies of all things `right' ,(in the political sense that is), but there appears to be a frison between the cut back king of the right and the spend advocate of the left. David is also married to his personal assistant who has more good one liners than an average stand up, so often steals the show. He also has to deal with his ageing parents, inability to write speeches, bad pronunciation and his ratings free fall in the polls. Meanwhile Martin (Eric Ericson) starts to have feelings of a non political nature for his alleged nemesis.So with bags more characters and humour thrown in, this is just one of those films that had me laughing for more than average in a film. It is all well acted and the comedy timing is perfect, but at the same time it has pathos and the emotions of all concerned are dealt with in a mature and grown up way, which is often missing from `rom coms'.Special mention has to go to Tova Magnusson- Norling, who directed this and plays David's wife, Fia, she is just superb but plays it just right to leave the lime light for the two main characters, this is also a gay film that avoids the bedroom squelch as it would be superfluous, so if that is your thing, then give this one a miss. But if you want something original, funny. Sweet in a good way and ruddy entertaining then this is a must see, so long as you don't mind the sub titles or can actually speak Swedish - absolutely recommended.",5,"Swedish, Political, Gay, Rom Com- and its brilliant!",1348704000,"09 27, 2012",2012,2099,"['simply', 'fantastic', 'film', 'sort', 'Thick', 'Sweden', 'gay', 'love', 'story', 'thrown', 'next', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'be', 'David', 'Holst', 'Bjorn', 'Kjellmann', 'happily', 'married', 'job', 'Party', 'Chairman', 'Liberal', 'Democrats', 'brought', 'up', 'Baptist', 'was', 'taught', 'believe', 'most', 'fun', 'things', 'were', 'wrong', 'causing', 'indulge', 'life', 'denial', 'including', 'punitive', 'masturbation', 'think', 'someone', 'ugly', ""'re"", 'doing', 'election', 'south', 'rebuild', 'party', 'ground', 'up', 'look', 'things', 'bit', 'differently.Then', 'stalking', 'horse', 'Socialists', 'Martin', 'such', 'sworn', 'enemies', 'things', 'right', 'political', 'sense', 'there', 'be', 'frison', 'cut', 'back', 'king', 'right', 'spend', 'advocate', 'left', 'David', 'also', 'married', 'personal', 'assistant', 'who', 'more', 'good', 'one', 'liners', 'average', 'stand', 'up', 'so', 'often', 'show', 'also', 'deal', 'ageing', 'parents', 'inability', 'write', 'speeches', 'bad', 'pronunciation', 'ratings', 'free', 'fall', 'polls', 'Meanwhile', 'Martin', 'Eric', 'Ericson', 'have', 'feelings', 'non', 'political', 'nature', 'alleged', 'nemesis.So', 'bags', 'more', 'characters', 'thrown', 'just', 'one', 'films', 'had', 'laughing', 'more', 'average', 'film', 'well', 'acted', 'comedy', 'timing', 'perfect', 'same', 'time', 'pathos', 'emotions', 'concerned', 'are', 'dealt', 'mature', 'grown', 'up', 'way', 'often', 'missing', 'rom', ""coms'.Special"", 'mention', 'go', 'Tova', 'Magnusson-', 'Norling', 'who', 'directed', 'David', 'wife', 'Fia', 'just', 'superb', 'just', 'right', 'leave', 'lime', 'light', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'also', 'gay', 'film', 'bedroom', 'squelch', 'would', 'be', 'superfluous', 'so', 'thing', 'then', 'give', 'one', 'miss', 'want', 'something', 'original', 'funny', 'Sweet', 'good', 'way', 'ruddy', 'entertaining', 'then', 'must', 'see', 'so', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'sub', 'titles', 'can', 'actually', 'speak', 'Swedish', 'absolutely', 'recommended']",N/A
