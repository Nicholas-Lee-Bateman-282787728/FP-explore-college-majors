417281,A13ZPQNYAWRII9,6304373732,burneyfan@btinternet.com,"[8, 9]","This film takes place against the backdrop of central Paris, always a plus  in my book. Michel Serrault plays Pierre Arnaud, a charming older man, a  retired judge, who  is well beyond his prime. At a pavement cafe, he is  introduced,  by a mutual friend, to Nelly, (Emmanuelle Beart) a lovely  young woman, and is immediately attracted to her, as any man of any age  would be. Within minutes she is confiding in him and he is offering her  money to pay off her three month's rent arrears. He then offers to employ  her to assist him in writing his memoirs . She accepts both, and in no time  they have set up a close working relationship, which becomes, as time goes  by,  increasingly pleasurable for both of them. However, he becomes  tormented by his love for her whilst finding himself, because of the  discrepancy in  their ages, unable to do anything about it.  She  is out of  reach and he can't bear it.In the mean time, she has divorced her  husband and has started dating Pierre's  young publisher. But her heart is  still with Pierre and when the publisher suggests that they live together  and she turns him down, he will have nothing more to do with her. She is  alone again.At this point, Pierre hears from his ex-wife that her second  husband has died and she is coming to Paris to see him. Then things  happen  quickly. One morning, two days later, Nelly arrives for work to be told  that Pierre and his ex-wife are leaving that morning  for an extended round  the world trip that will take several  months. Nelly is  stunned by this  news, suddenly realising how much Pierre means to her. Pierre, empathising  with her and now fully aware of the  enormity of what  he is about to do,  passionately embraces her for the first and last time as he says goodbye.  Both now accept that their love is doomed to remain unconsummated.At the  airport, whilst his ex-wife is  getting the tickets, he stands in a reverie  thinking longingly of Nelly. At that same moment we see her, having  finished her  work for the day, walking home with her head held high and  then  disappearing into the crowd. We are left wishing her well and  desperately wanting to know  what the future  holds for her. It is an  inconclusive, poignant ending typical of  so many French films.If  you like the intimacy and  subtlety of French films then you will like this  one. But it is a film to like and not rave about. It is a very gentle film  - perhaps too much so. As  some other reviewer has said, Emmanuelle Beart  is very passive; she certainly lacks vivacity. But that is probably a trait  that some will like.

Anyone who is intrigued by relations between older men and younger women will be instantly attracted to this film. Emmanuelle B&eacute;art as Nelly is gorgeous, as usual, and does a fine job as the May part of the relationship. Michel Serrault, a top actor for decades, gives us many layers as the older man, a married judge.  The two do not have an affair, which probably makes the film more complex and unusual than if they did.  However, I'm also reminded of B&eacute;art in &quot;Un Couer en Hiver&quot; (&quot;A Heart in Winter&quot;) and that film so thoroughly mesmerized me, and was so absolutely a 5 star film, that I just can't say this one is that excellent.

Though he emphatically tells her that he wants nothing from her, they grow to love and depend on each other in a non-sexual relationship that brightens their lives.

417284,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,6304373732,Dennis Littrell,"[2, 3]","are featured rather prominently in this ultra sophisticated film by Claude Sautet, perhaps to the point of annoyance for some.  Mlle. Beart, whom I first saw in Claude Berri's Manon of the Spring (1986), has the largest, most beautiful eyes one would ever want to see, and she is a fine actress with a smooth and subtle style.  However I think that Sautet worked too exclusively with glances of nuance, raised and lowered lids, eyes widened and narrowed and such and such to further the story and to create character when he might have added a line of dialogue here and there.Yet I liked this and certainly prefer such a style to the loud gestures and over the top hysterics that some directors might have employed.  Nelly and Monsieur Arnaud (Beart and Michel Serrault) do raise their voices once--a lover's spat one might say, he to perhaps show he is still alive, she to show that she cares enough to get angry with him and has an independent spirit.This then is a love story, super fine like gossamer and civilized to the point of something close to a burlesque of being civilized, and yet, and yet, because he is well past the age of retirement and she a vibrant young woman in her prime, the story must be presented in symbol and gesture: the back rub, the Platonic staying overnight, the little spat mentioned above, the muted jealousies, the stealthy triumph of the returning wife--in short it has everything a love affair might have, the bittersweet (their parting) and the bitter (a night with another, younger man) and the very sweet (the Sauternes, Chateau d'Yquem, no less, older than the woman herself, apres diner).What Sautet does so well and so completely here is show how such a bloodless affair can touch the heart of both the old guy who knows that he can never express himself sexually and the young woman who knows that as well, how their love is emotional and deeply felt but like those two ships passing in the night, ephemeral and at some unavoidable distance.  One could say--and I think we'll all felt this--that the two are soul mates separated by an implacable difference in age who by chance experience an intimation of their love together, and then it is gone.I also liked the behavior in which Nelly says she has done something and then, only after she has said she has done it, does she do it!  At first she rejects Arnaud's financial help.  Then she tells her husband that she has gotten this money from an older man, gratis, and only then does she accept the money.  Later in the film she tells Arnaud that she spent the night with the editor when she has not, and then afterwards, she does spend the night with him.  Interesting psychology.  I have actually known someone who would do that.  It is like trying out an action to see how it is received before doing it!There is one rather serious problem with this DVD.  On my Samsung flat screen TV only the first line of the subtitles could be read.  Only the very top of the second line appeared, forcing me to miss some of the subtleties of the dialogue.  I understand this is in the DVD since other reviewers have reported the same problem.See this for Michel Serrault, whose credits in 12-point type are longer than my arm (IMDb lists 155 as an actor) and for Emmanuelle Beart whose unique beauty is unforgettable.",3,The eyes of Emmanuelle Beart,1166227200,"12 16, 2006",2006,3303,"['are', 'featured', 'rather', 'prominently', 'ultra', 'sophisticated', 'film', 'Claude', 'Sautet', 'perhaps', 'point', 'annoyance', 'Mlle', 'Beart', 'whom', 'first', 'saw', 'Claude', 'Berri', 'Manon', 'Spring', '1986', 'largest', 'most', 'beautiful', 'eyes', 'one', 'would', 'ever', 'want', 'see', 'fine', 'actress', 'smooth', 'subtle', 'style', 'However', 'think', 'Sautet', 'worked', 'too', 'exclusively', 'glances', 'nuance', 'raised', 'lowered', 'lids', 'eyes', 'widened', 'narrowed', 'such', 'such', 'further', 'story', 'create', 'character', 'when', 'might', 'have', 'added', 'line', 'dialogue', 'here', 'there.Yet', 'liked', 'certainly', 'prefer', 'such', 'style', 'loud', 'gestures', 'top', 'hysterics', 'directors', 'might', 'have', 'employed', 'Nelly', 'Monsieur', 'Arnaud', 'Beart', 'Michel', 'Serrault', 'do', 'raise', 'voices', 'once', 'lover', 'spat', 'one', 'might', 'say', 'perhaps', 'show', 'still', 'alive', 'show', 'enough', 'get', 'angry', 'independent', 'spirit.This', 'then', 'love', 'story', 'super', 'fine', 'gossamer', 'civilized', 'point', 'something', 'close', 'burlesque', 'being', 'civilized', 'yet', 'yet', 'well', 'age', 'retirement', 'vibrant', 'young', 'woman', 'prime', 'story', 'must', 'be', 'presented', 'symbol', 'gesture', 'back', 'rub', 'Platonic', 'staying', 'overnight', 'little', 'spat', 'mentioned', 'muted', 'jealousies', 'stealthy', 'triumph', 'returning', 'wife', 'short', 'everything', 'love', 'affair', 'might', 'have', 'bittersweet', 'parting', 'bitter', 'night', 'younger', 'man', 'very', 'sweet', 'Sauternes', 'Chateau', ""d'Yquem"", 'less', 'older', 'woman', 'diner', 'Sautet', 'so', 'well', 'so', 'completely', 'here', 'show', 'how', 'such', 'bloodless', 'affair', 'can', 'touch', 'heart', 'old', 'guy', 'who', 'can', 'never', 'express', 'sexually', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'as', 'well', 'how', 'love', 'emotional', 'deeply', 'felt', 'two', 'ships', 'passing', 'night', 'ephemeral', 'unavoidable', 'distance', 'One', 'could', 'say', 'think', ""'ll"", 'felt', 'two', 'are', 'soul', 'mates', 'separated', 'implacable', 'difference', 'age', 'who', 'chance', 'experience', 'intimation', 'love', 'together', 'then', 'gone.I', 'also', 'liked', 'behavior', 'Nelly', 'done', 'something', 'then', 'only', 'said', 'done', 'do', 'first', 'Arnaud', 'financial', 'help', 'Then', 'husband', 'gotten', 'money', 'older', 'man', 'gratis', 'only', 'then', 'accept', 'money', 'Later', 'film', 'spent', 'night', 'editor', 'when', 'not', 'then', 'afterwards', 'spend', 'night', 'Interesting', 'psychology', 'have', 'actually', 'known', 'someone', 'who', 'would', 'do', 'trying', 'out', 'action', 'see', 'how', 'received', 'doing', 'one', 'rather', 'serious', 'problem', 'DVD', 'Samsung', 'flat', 'screen', 'TV', 'only', 'first', 'line', 'subtitles', 'could', 'be', 'read', 'Only', 'very', 'top', 'second', 'line', 'appeared', 'forcing', 'miss', 'subtleties', 'dialogue', 'understand', 'DVD', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'reported', 'same', 'problem.See', 'Michel', 'Serrault', 'credits', '12-point', 'type', 'are', 'longer', 'arm', 'IMDb', '155', 'actor', 'Emmanuelle', 'Beart', 'unique', 'beauty', 'unforgettable']",Nelly and Monsieur Arnaud VHS
417285,A3UQ1T1YH43TQT,6304373732,"""eguisheim""","[10, 11]","This is the film that I watch when I am in a decidedly Parisian mood.  The lightning fast dialogue, the eloquent gestures and the few glimpses of the city conjure up that wonderful Parisian essence. The outdoor scenes are pre-wintry gray whereas the indoor scenes are softly luminous.  These descriptions can also be attributed to the distinguished, older Monsieur Arnaud (a delightfully cynical but witty Michel Serrault) and the beautiful young Nelly (Emmanuelle Beart's loveliness saves her from mediocre acting abilities).Nelly is a woman in her twenties struggling to make ends meet after being laid off from her publishing job.  The fact that her husband (Charles Berling of Ridicule) is also out of work and completely demotivated allows her to entertain an offer that she would not normally accept - a substantial loan from a virtual stranger, Monsieur Arnaud.  She meets Monsieur Arnaud through her elegant, older friend, Jacqueline who confides that she once had an affair with this judge turned successful businessman.  Jacqueline was attracted by his ability to really listen to a woman and offer true friendship.  Nelly ends up accepting Pierre Arnaud's offer to type up his memoirs, and the two develop a unique relationship as they match wits in editing his manuscript.  He's alternately gruff yet admiring while she's coyly feigning nonchalance.  An undeniable chemistry exists but is never physically expressed.Monsieur Arnaud's publisher, the young, dark, somewhat smarmy Vincent is immediately attracted to Nelly.  She's reluctantly drawn to him after spending an enjoyable evening with Monsieur Arnaud in one of Paris' most exclusive restaurants.  Why she gets treated to this extravagant evening is a fun story in and of itself.  After a dinner of remarkable fare, exceptional dessert wine (Chateau d'Yquem, 1961!) and flirtatious conversation, the desire to end the evening in intimacy results in Nelly seeking out Vincent.  While Pierre Arnaud provides her with stimulating and heartfelt companionship, Vincent merely provides her with a physical outlet.  Although Vincent wants more from Nelly, in her eyes, he cannot take Pierre's place.The subplots also support the major theme of love and age.  A sweetly sad movie that will satisfy those in the mood for good (French) dialogue and a twist on the May-December relationship.",5,Longing for Ageless Love,1008892800,"12 21, 2001",2001,2350,"['film', 'watch', 'when', 'am', 'decidedly', 'Parisian', 'mood', 'lightning', 'fast', 'dialogue', 'eloquent', 'gestures', 'few', 'glimpses', 'city', 'conjure', 'up', 'wonderful', 'Parisian', 'essence', 'outdoor', 'scenes', 'are', 'pre-wintry', 'gray', 'indoor', 'scenes', 'are', 'softly', 'luminous', 'descriptions', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'attributed', 'distinguished', 'older', 'Monsieur', 'Arnaud', 'delightfully', 'cynical', 'witty', 'Michel', 'Serrault', 'beautiful', 'young', 'Nelly', 'Emmanuelle', 'Beart', 'loveliness', 'mediocre', 'acting', 'abilities', '.Nelly', 'woman', 'twenties', 'struggling', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'being', 'laid', 'off', 'publishing', 'job', 'fact', 'husband', 'Charles', 'Berling', 'Ridicule', 'also', 'work', 'completely', 'demotivated', 'entertain', 'offer', 'would', 'not', 'normally', 'accept', 'substantial', 'loan', 'virtual', 'stranger', 'Monsieur', 'Arnaud', 'Monsieur', 'Arnaud', 'elegant', 'older', 'friend', 'Jacqueline', 'who', 'once', 'had', 'affair', 'judge', 'turned', 'successful', 'businessman', 'Jacqueline', 'was', 'attracted', 'ability', 'really', 'listen', 'woman', 'offer', 'true', 'friendship', 'Nelly', 'up', 'accepting', 'Pierre', 'Arnaud', 'offer', 'type', 'up', 'memoirs', 'two', 'develop', 'unique', 'relationship', 'match', 'wits', 'editing', 'manuscript', 'alternately', 'gruff', 'yet', 'admiring', 'coyly', 'feigning', 'nonchalance', 'undeniable', 'chemistry', 'exists', 'never', 'physically', 'expressed.Monsieur', 'Arnaud', 'publisher', 'young', 'dark', 'somewhat', 'smarmy', 'Vincent', 'immediately', 'attracted', 'Nelly', 'reluctantly', 'drawn', 'spending', 'enjoyable', 'evening', 'Monsieur', 'Arnaud', 'one', 'Paris', 'most', 'exclusive', 'restaurants', 'Why', 'treated', 'extravagant', 'evening', 'fun', 'story', 'dinner', 'remarkable', 'fare', 'exceptional', 'dessert', 'wine', 'Chateau', ""d'Yquem"", '1961', 'flirtatious', 'conversation', 'desire', 'end', 'evening', 'intimacy', 'results', 'Nelly', 'seeking', 'out', 'Vincent', 'Pierre', 'Arnaud', 'stimulating', 'heartfelt', 'companionship', 'Vincent', 'merely', 'physical', 'outlet', 'Vincent', 'more', 'Nelly', 'eyes', 'can', 'not', 'take', 'Pierre', 'place.The', 'subplots', 'also', 'support', 'major', 'theme', 'love', 'age', 'sweetly', 'sad', 'movie', 'will', 'satisfy', 'mood', 'good', 'French', 'dialogue', 'twist', 'May-December', 'relationship']",Nelly and Monsieur Arnaud VHS

417288,A1Q0AQ2HVNSYYW,6304373732,Mr. Cairene,"[5, 10]","Claude Sautet Nelly and Mr.Arnaud is a sumptous film to look at. Every frame in this film has bright and varied colors that look like pictures from an interior decorating magazine. It is at its most complling in its  early scenes between Nelly and Mr.Arnaud, he is somewhat overbearing in his  need to start conversation, or perhaps confess to past short comings. Yet  he never beats around the bush so to speak because as one character in the  film observes abot him &quot;He has lived two lives.&quot; Emmanuelle Beart  who is wonderful in this movie(and wonderful to look at) is quiet,  observant and in an offhand way suggest a deep intelligence behind these  eyes. She constantly handles herself in an relaxed manner, and only in the  end when she learns of Mr.Arnauds leaving that she is slighly shaken. She  like Mr.Arnaud has been through enough of life to have an understated  reaction to what goes on around her. The film is best enjoyed on a quiet  lonely afternoon where you can savour its decor and the almost to subtle  character revelations. The trouble is that its almost too understated  emotionally, the only music on the score that I recall is in the final  minute. The characters are too seasoned for us to enjoy their self  discovery. Perhaps the American equivelant of this film would be Martin  Brest's Scent of A Woman, both feature the regretfull confessions of an  older man to a seemingly distracted youthful companion. And although this  film is more subtle, I was dying for the emotional release, the operatic  splendor of that film. Nelly and Mr.Arnaud is intellectually satisfying but  emotionally underwhelming.

417289,A220FJEQNGMSRN,6304373732,Trevor Willsmer,"[0, 0]","Nelly et Monsieur Arnaud is a chamber piece that never really goes anywhere. It's not so much that it's bad, more that it's slightly flat compared to Claude Sautet's earlier films like Les Choses de la Vie and Cesar et Rosalie despite an amusing cameo by Michel Lonsdale, appearing like a self-satisfied but slightly dense slug from time to time. It's a film that probably meant more to Sautet than his audience (Michel Serrault based his performance on the director, as witnessed by the photos of the two on the set in identical outfits and haircuts). To me it was little more than a time-passer with few insights, although the sight of Emmanuelle Beart's hopelessly inept attempts at faking being an accomplished typist offered some unintentional amusement: obviously this is one actress who never worked as a secretary while resting.The French DVD offers a good widescreen transfer with removeable English subtitles. The only extras are a stills gallery and the French trailer.",3,Affectionate and affable but less than meets the eye,1200614400,"01 18, 2008",2008,980,"['Nelly', 'et', 'Monsieur', 'Arnaud', 'chamber', 'piece', 'never', 'really', 'anywhere', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'bad', 'more', 'slightly', 'flat', 'compared', 'Claude', 'Sautet', 'earlier', 'films', 'Les', 'Choses', 'de', 'la', 'Vie', 'Cesar', 'et', 'Rosalie', 'amusing', 'cameo', 'Michel', 'Lonsdale', 'appearing', 'self-satisfied', 'slightly', 'dense', 'slug', 'time', 'time', 'film', 'probably', 'meant', 'more', 'Sautet', 'audience', 'Michel', 'Serrault', 'based', 'performance', 'director', 'witnessed', 'photos', 'two', 'set', 'identical', 'outfits', 'haircuts', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'time-passer', 'few', 'insights', 'sight', 'Emmanuelle', 'Beart', 'hopelessly', 'inept', 'attempts', 'faking', 'being', 'accomplished', 'typist', 'offered', 'unintentional', 'amusement', 'obviously', 'one', 'actress', 'who', 'never', 'worked', 'secretary', 'resting.The', 'French', 'DVD', 'good', 'widescreen', 'transfer', 'removeable', 'English', 'subtitles', 'only', 'extras', 'are', 'stills', 'gallery', 'French', 'trailer']",Nelly and Monsieur Arnaud VHS
