Sassi,"[0, 0]","It's a movie about a dying person who falls for a man whose approach to women and relationships is no different from that of a conquering army toward the spoils of wartime. This is not to say the guy is a bad character; he instead personifies the young, rich, self-made man who views life as something to enjoy and conquer to the fullest. It is clear since the beginning that the guy is not going to be insensitive to the kind and lovingly attentions of the girl; what is not clear is the twist that materializes about half way into the movie. All considered this is a nice, clean and entertaining movie. It is also a tear-jerker and it does have a small attempt to character development.

It was disjointed, seemed trying to just fill up dead air and run out the clock. The male lead was so annoying and senseless I wanted to slap him.I guess it's cultural, but when he steals a car and abandons it a few blocks away as a happy lark type thing---grinning and running away from pursuers hand-in-hand with the girl---I shut it down.

1422542,A27L60JENYODDV,B004NYCVBA,Harvey Woodmeadow,"[4, 4]","Based purely on technical merit, I'd only give the movie 3 stars. It's reasonably well-done, but only so.But who cares? The overall story and acting push it to a solid 4 stars.The first half of the movie plays like a ""rom-com"", but in a fresh, very fun and entertaining way. The ""player"" Min-su meets Hye-won, an amazingly energetic and cheerful woman staying at the same hospital that coincidentally Min-su later winds up at ""for some rest"".Of course he falls in love, and is eventually set out on a 12-step program of reformation, minus 11 steps (watch the movie, and you'll see what I mean :) ).The acting is well-done, especially Hye-won's character, who has a captivating bounce and recklessness, along with the natural ability to resist Min-su's usual charm routine and to put him in his place.The second half of the movie is a tear-jerker, but only because of the almost-incidentally bad hand life has dealt the couple. ""Incidentally"" not because it's not relevant to the story; it definitely is. But at the same time, the story is really about how the two make the most of what they have found: happiness and the ability to rise above whatever challenges they have. In that sense, it's still a heartwarming and upbeat story.And if any of the movie is less than believable, whether the hijinx the characters get into or the way they manage to handle the stress without taking it out on each other, so what? The characters are heroic, and that's the way some of the best stories are. If I want realism, where people use violence to solve the smallest problems, I'll go for a walk or watch the evening news. Who needs that kind of realism in their movies?
