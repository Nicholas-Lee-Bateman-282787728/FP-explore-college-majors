I was wrong on all accounts. I am not that big a fan of Superman or Shazam but loved the three shorts and thought expanded editions meant longer versions which would have made this disc worth the purchase price even without the main feature. DC has done a great job with these releases till now but it looks like I will have to be much more careful in the future.

Is this the old BTAS episode or a remake? And if it is a remake - why not do something different?Likewise the Green Arrow episode is described by one reviewer as ""Initiation,"" but that was the first episode of Justice League Unlimited.

1376992,A3DIS5O83SQJWW,B003Z8ZCD4,"Amazon Customer ""geekacres""","[1, 1]","I won't enter into the gripe about this being a collection of shorts.  Everyone has already done a decent job at addressing that.  But what I will do is provide my insights into this collection of vignettes from the DC Universe.SHAZAM - This is the one that brought me to the party.  I was curious to see what they would do with Shazam and the Man of Steel.  Honestly, it was a superpowered street fight.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, but this could have been so much more.THE SPECTRE - I didn't really know anything about the Spectre before seeing this short.  I think it was well done and like the Crime Noir feel to it.  The ending was especially cool.GREEN ARROW - I am a bit of a fan of The Green Arrow, whether that's the traditional flavor or the 21st Century Smallville incarnation.  This Emerald Archer outing is a fun ride and draws the viewer in to a quick outing that's a bit Robin Hood, and a bit Die Hard.  Nicely done.JONAH HEX - Again, I've got to plead ignorance when it comes to Jonah Hex.  The story setting was done well enough.  But I just didn't get much of a feel on who our anti-hero was or why he was so interested in his prey.  The interaction was intriguing enough.  Just not sure what it told me about Jonah Hex, or why i should care.DC and WB certainly didn't cheap out on the voice talent.  There's a great array of talented actos and actresses here, from series regulars to pleasant surprises.  In the end, I'd say this one is worth a rent, or a bargain-bin clearance.  But save your money for one of the full length features.  This peek through the fence only gives a fleeting glimpse of the heroics.",3,"Entertaining enough, in short bursts",1297209600,"02 9, 2011",2011,1639,"['wo', ""n't"", 'enter', 'gripe', 'being', 'collection', 'shorts', 'Everyone', 'already', 'done', 'decent', 'job', 'addressing', 'what', 'will', 'do', 'provide', 'insights', 'collection', 'vignettes', 'DC', 'Universe.SHAZAM', 'one', 'brought', 'party', 'was', 'curious', 'see', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'Shazam', 'Man', 'Steel', 'Honestly', 'was', 'superpowered', 'street', 'fight', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'more.THE', 'SPECTRE', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'anything', 'Spectre', 'seeing', 'short', 'think', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'Crime', 'Noir', 'feel', 'ending', 'was', 'especially', 'cool.GREEN', 'ARROW', 'am', 'bit', 'fan', 'Green', 'Arrow', 'traditional', 'flavor', '21st', 'Century', 'Smallville', 'incarnation', 'Emerald', 'Archer', 'outing', 'fun', 'ride', 'viewer', 'quick', 'outing', 'bit', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'bit', 'Die', 'Hard', 'Nicely', 'done.JONAH', 'HEX', 'Again', ""'ve"", 'got', 'plead', 'ignorance', 'when', 'Jonah', 'Hex', 'story', 'setting', 'was', 'done', 'well', 'enough', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'feel', 'who', 'anti-hero', 'was', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'interested', 'prey', 'interaction', 'was', 'intriguing', 'enough', 'Just', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'told', 'Jonah', 'Hex', 'why', 'i', 'should', 'care.DC', 'WB', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'cheap', 'out', 'voice', 'talent', 'great', 'array', 'talented', 'actos', 'actresses', 'here', 'series', 'regulars', 'pleasant', 'surprises', 'end', ""'d"", 'say', 'one', 'rent', 'bargain-bin', 'clearance', 'save', 'money', 'one', 'full', 'length', 'features', 'peek', 'fence', 'only', 'fleeting', 'glimpse', 'heroics']",Superman/Shazam!: The Return of Black Adam

Why bother?), the Green Arrow's power is having arrows that ignore the laws of physics, Jonah Hex's power is not needing an adequate motivation to drive a plot, and the Spectre's power is being an enormous a-hole.In all seriousness, these shorts are very well made (often with a profligate waste of voice talent, like having Michelle Trachtenberg speak only two short lines that might as well have been mimed), but they'll really only appeal to diehard fans of DC's non-Batman properties.  I've seen these same characters elsewhere and enjoyed them, but here I was mostly bored despite the production values.  I'd say the Green Arrow's segment is the best, followed by Jonah Hex's, but those are both pretty short.  Overall, these are often too violent for kids, and too cartoony for adult non-diehards like me.  And I say that as someone who has watched and enjoyed pretty much every animated version of Batman and a couple of Superman.* Minor spoiler *The Spectre's segment actually made me angry.  He's essentially a ghost jedi who avenges murder victims and who masquerades as a police detective by day.  That's a pretty sweet premise, but after asking exactly two questions of one witness (""Did he have any enemies?  What are their names?""), he then proceeds to murder the suspects.  They all turn out to be guilty, but if the case is that easy to solve, why not just let the police handle it and, you know, let that whole fruity due process thing have a shot?  I understand there are time constraints on the plot, but they really couldn't spend 30 seconds establishing that the justice system had failed by showing someone bribe a jury or something?***By the way, I know the character's name is Captain Marvel and not Shazam (that's actually the wizard who invites little Billy into a cave and gives him powers), but it's more fun to call him Shazam!",2,"An educational primer, but not that entertaining",1311465600,"07 24, 2011",2011,2002,"['So', 'Shazam', 'superpower', 'being', 'cheesiest', 'adolescent', 'power', 'fantasy', 'ever', 'Superman', 'power', 'being', 'heterosexual', 'Shazam', 'jaunty', 'sash', 'Why', 'bother', 'Green', 'Arrow', 'power', 'having', 'arrows', 'ignore', 'laws', 'physics', 'Jonah', 'Hex', 'power', 'not', 'needing', 'adequate', 'motivation', 'drive', 'plot', 'Spectre', 'power', 'being', 'enormous', 'a-hole.In', 'seriousness', 'shorts', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'often', 'profligate', 'waste', 'voice', 'talent', 'having', 'Michelle', 'Trachtenberg', 'only', 'two', 'short', 'lines', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'mimed', ""'ll"", 'really', 'only', 'appeal', 'diehard', 'fans', 'DC', 'non-Batman', 'properties', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'same', 'characters', 'elsewhere', 'enjoyed', 'here', 'was', 'mostly', 'bored', 'production', 'values', ""'d"", 'say', 'Green', 'Arrow', 'segment', 'best', 'followed', 'Jonah', 'Hex', 'are', 'pretty', 'short', 'Overall', 'are', 'often', 'too', 'violent', 'kids', 'too', 'cartoony', 'adult', 'non-diehards', 'say', 'someone', 'who', 'watched', 'enjoyed', 'pretty', 'much', 'animated', 'version', 'Batman', 'couple', 'Superman', '*', 'Minor', 'spoiler', '*The', 'Spectre', 'segment', 'actually', 'made', 'angry', 'essentially', 'ghost', 'jedi', 'who', 'murder', 'victims', 'who', 'police', 'detective', 'day', 'pretty', 'sweet', 'premise', 'asking', 'exactly', 'two', 'questions', 'one', 'witness', 'Did', 'have', 'enemies', 'What', 'are', 'names', 'then', 'murder', 'suspects', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'guilty', 'case', 'easy', 'solve', 'why', 'not', 'just', 'let', 'police', 'handle', 'know', 'let', 'whole', 'fruity', 'due', 'process', 'thing', 'have', 'shot', 'understand', 'are', 'time', 'constraints', 'plot', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'spend', '30', 'seconds', 'establishing', 'justice', 'system', 'had', 'failed', 'showing', 'someone', 'bribe', 'jury', 'something', 'way', 'know', 'character', 'name', 'Captain', 'Marvel', 'not', 'Shazam', 'actually', 'wizard', 'who', 'little', 'Billy', 'cave', 'powers', 'more', 'fun', 'call', 'Shazam']",Superman/Shazam!: The Return of Black Adam

Ive only see the movies of the ""Big Three"" So all of these shorts were new for me. The Superman/ Shazam short is a lot of fun. Captain Marvel looks great, and the Super smackdown between him/Superman/and Black Adam is AWESOME. A nice clean version of The Captains origin story.The Spectre short is also a lot of fun. Easily made me re-appreciate a silver age icon. The direction of the short is tight and neatly explains the character. The story about vengeance and justice makes me want to see the Spectre developed a bit more in a longer feature.One of my personal favorites, Green Arrow, is given a sleek pedal to the metal adventure, where he has to protect a young monarch. Two classic ""Arrow"" villains make an appearance in this one. My favorite DC heroine saves the day and I think its the fist time, I'VE seen Black Canary. WHEN will Arrow get his own live action movie? Could be cool.Lastly, the Jonah Hex short was more enjoyable than I expected. One of personal favorite actors, Thomas Jane does a great voice portrayal of Hex. This short made me more curious about the live action movie, which as of the viewing of the DVD, I hadnt seen yet.Nothing but good things to say about this one. Glad I watched it, I would recommend it to slightly older fans, not to young, (parents) take the PG 13 as seriously as you deem appropriate.

This product is mostly a collection of shorts from other DVDs, so if you have those shorts it's not worth buying this DVD.If you don't have the other DC animated DVDs, though, this is a delightful survey of the DC Universe. It presents four short films that introduce some of the lesser-known characters in the DC Universe. First we have the origin of Captain Marvel as he teams up with Superman against Black Adam. Captain Marvel is a kid who transforms into an adult when he utters the word ""Shazam,"" and his charming childlike attitude is on full display here. Next up is the Spectre, which takes a different tone with a creepy film noir-esque vibe. We also have Green Arrow, a guy who is a bit of a tool but who has a good heart, and then a gruff western story starring bounty hunter Jonah Hex.Each episode has its own distinct feel to it and shows off what is appealing about the characters. The animation is top-notch, and the films feature some veteran voice actors. If you don't have the DVDs where these films originally got featured, then this is a good product. If you do have the DVDs but would prefer to have the shorts all in one place, this is also useful to have.",5,A great preview of the DC Universe,1341014400,"06 30, 2012",2012,1331,"['Let', 'get', 'one', 'thing', 'way', 'right', 'now', 'review', 'written', 'perspective', 'somebody', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'other', 'DC', 'animated', 'DVDs', 'product', 'mostly', 'collection', 'shorts', 'other', 'DVDs', 'so', 'have', 'shorts', 'not', 'worth', 'buying', 'DVD.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'other', 'DC', 'animated', 'DVDs', 'though', 'delightful', 'survey', 'DC', 'Universe', 'four', 'short', 'films', 'introduce', 'lesser-known', 'characters', 'DC', 'Universe', 'First', 'have', 'origin', 'Captain', 'Marvel', 'up', 'Superman', 'Black', 'Adam', 'Captain', 'Marvel', 'kid', 'who', 'adult', 'when', 'word', 'Shazam', 'charming', 'childlike', 'attitude', 'full', 'display', 'here', 'Next', 'up', 'Spectre', 'different', 'tone', 'creepy', 'film', 'noir-esque', 'vibe', 'also', 'have', 'Green', 'Arrow', 'guy', 'who', 'bit', 'tool', 'who', 'good', 'heart', 'then', 'gruff', 'western', 'story', 'starring', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'Jonah', 'Hex.Each', 'episode', 'own', 'distinct', 'feel', 'off', 'what', 'appealing', 'characters', 'animation', 'top-notch', 'films', 'feature', 'veteran', 'voice', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'DVDs', 'where', 'films', 'originally', 'got', 'featured', 'then', 'good', 'product', 'do', 'have', 'DVDs', 'would', 'prefer', 'have', 'shorts', 'one', 'place', 'also', 'useful', 'have']",Superman/Shazam!: The Return of Black Adam

1377011,AYRFLAT8VF732,B003Z8ZCD4,"DC_Fan_52 ""-Weasel!""","[1, 2]","I love DC. I buy all of their DVDs and movies. But, you gotta learn that sometimes, you don't need to get things right away. I did the same thing with the Lord of the Rings - I didn't want to pay $60 for the Bluray, so I waited a year and a half, and got it for half the price.When this came out, I was low on cash, so there was no way I'd pay $20 for 30 minutes of new material. No matter how many old shorts they crammed in there. No matter how much I love Superman or Captain Marvel. So, I waited, and now it's finally cheap enough.Okay, ""The Return of Black Adam"" is a new interpretation of the Origin of Captain Marvel, cobbled together from various sources, from the Golden Age Origin, Jeff Smith's ""Shazam and the Monster Society of Evil,"" and ""Superman/Shazam: First Thunder."" Billy Batson is a boy, who is granted superpowers by the Wizard - Shazam. His new powers attract Black Adam, the Wizard's first failed champion. Superman joins with Captain Marvel to defeat the new threat. It's one action packed slugfest.I can't complain about the voice acting, but the one thing that was distracting was the animation. I can't tell who is responsible for this, but they chose to use the same animation style as the Boondocks. So each time I watch it, I expect Billy to start swearing at any moment. That's just me, though, if you haven't watched the Boondocks cartoon it won't be an issue for you.As for the rest of the content on the Bluray, it does contain the first three animated shorts featuring The Spectre, Jonah Hex, and Green Arrow. Sadly, the Catwoman short was produced AFTER this was released. They're supposed to be ""Extended Versions,"" but it's a matter of seconds added to each short cartoon. I does come with commentary for each feature, including ""The Return of Black Adam.""One minor plus, they also include four bonus cartoons from other DC cartoon series. ""Initiation"" featuring Green Arrow from Justice League Unlimited. ""Clash"" featuring Captain Marvel from Justice League Unlimited. ""Chill of the Night"" featuring The Spectre from Batman the Brave and the Bold. And ""Showdown"" featuring Jonah Hex from Batman: the Animated Series. This might be the only way to get these episodes on Bluray for a while.But, ultimately, I was only mildly satisfied with the overall product. Billy and Captain Marvel deserve their own full-length movie, or their own series. This short only made me realize that I want more. Plus, having to wait two years for it to come down in price, I rate this Bluray a 3-out-of-5 Stars.

1377018,AEDHD7LIGEKB2,B003Z8ZCD4,Fan Boy 15,"[8, 15]","At first I cursed DC for collecting all the previous animated shorts (that I splurged to get on the two-disc sets) onto one dvd and adding a brand new, must-have Superman/Shazam short to make us buy it. At least I knew of this release early enough that I could save money by buying just the single disc edition of Superman/Batman:Apocalypse. It's too bad I caved and got the double. The bright side is that we get extended(?) versions of the previous shorts. And don't forget those ever-present two/four bonus episodes presented by Bruce Timm. I really enjoyed the first three shorts. The Spectre is my favorite because of its realistic animation style. The others are cool too, just more like the JLU show which I suspect the Supe/Shazam short will be too, based on the back cover. But I'm still not letting you off the hook Warner/DC!!! You want your dvds to sell, then stop short changing us fans.NEW 2011 REVIEW: I finally rewatched the older shorts and while they're still great, they do NOT seem extended like the packaging claims. They are practically the same length as they were on previous DC releases. And Captain Marvel is such a great character that he deserved a full length origin movie WITHOUT any other heroes stealing screen time. The four choice selected bonus cartoons pad out this  short release and as they should. But this whole tired formula wears thin. The 60-75 min. feature, one maybe two documentaries which are not always thorough (the best ones only on the blu-ray), and the recycling old episodes we already have, split on two discs for profit, when it all really fits on one disc. Listen Up DC/Warner, this is the reason fans rent instead of buying. Be the exception and put out complete and thorough products that your loyal customers deserve.

1377023,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B003Z8ZCD4,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[4, 4]","SUPERMAN/SHAZAM! - THE RETURN OF BLACK ADAM is the featured short in this DVD offering, and the spotlight is well warranted. This is a terrific action-packed adventure which reintroduces (and modernizes) the origin of the World's Mightiest Mortal and has him teaming up with the Man of Steel, to boot. Since this featured short runs at only around 24 minutes long, it's damn decent of DC and Warner Brothers to also pack this DVD with three previously released shorts in the DC Showcase animated collection (featuring the Specter short from JUSTICE LEAGUE: CRISIS ON TWO EARTHS, the Jonah Hex short from BATMAN: UNDER THE RED HOOD, and the Green Arrow short - in his Mike Grell hooded costume - from SUPERMAN/BATMAN: APOCALYPSE). So, yes, know what you're going into. The Superman/Shazam! story is the only thing spanking new in this DVD.Superman has three vulnerabilities: kryptonite, magic, and girls with two 'L's in their names. Black Adam has magic oozing out his ears, which presents a definite challenge for the Man of Steel. Black Adam has returned to Earth after five thousand years of an exile imposed on him by the wizard Shazam. Crashing into Fawcett City, Black Adam's mission is to seek out Shazam's chosen new champion and kill him. Except that young Billy Batson hasn't yet met the immortal wizard. Billy inhabits a cramped apartment in a slum neighborhood, but he hasn't allowed the awful urban condition to infect him. Billy has his head on straight, strives to do the right thing (little dude even feeds the rats in his apartment). It helps that he's got Clark Kent for a mentor.It's ironic that Black Adam's first attempt on his life proves to be the catalyst which introduces Billy to the wizard haunting the subway station. And so, with one magic word, the lightning flashes and the kid transforms into the imposing Captain Marvel. It's an exhilarating thing to see. It's nice, too, that at this stage Superman doesn't just get shoved to the sidelines. He and the rookie play equal roles in taking on and besting Black Adam.The animation is superb. Whoever came up with the blistering action sequences was dreaming big. I love that the scope of the battle reflects the inhuman power of our characters. Automobiles and colossal obelisks hurtle thru the air. Heroes and villain collide with concussive force. Black Adam holding up that fire engine truck is an awesome, awesome sight. The animation sells all this marvelously. This being a short, there isn't much time for heavy plot development, but the story moves at a crackling pace while doing a solid job of conveying the core personality traits of the three main characters. I love that the writers managed to capture Billy Batson's exuberance and innocence, especially in his guise as the Big Red Cheese. And the Mister Tawky Tawny sighting is much appreciated. I think C.C. Beck would've been proud of this one. Not even the fat kid from STAND BY ME doing the voice of Captain Marvel could ruin this one. James Garner as the wizard Shazam is nothing but awesome.Besides the three other animated shorts - which are all fantastic (with the Green Arrow short being my favorite of the three) - the DVD also has the trailer to BATMAN: THE BRAVE AND THE BOLD and four episodes from past DC cartoon shows as selected by Bruce Timm: ""Showdown"" from BATMAN: T.A.S. (featuring Jonah Hex and Ra's al Ghul), ""The Chill of the Night"" from BATMAN: THE BRAVE AND THE BOLD (featuring the Specter, Phantom Stranger, and Zatanna), ""Initiation"" (featuring Green Arrow, Captain Atom, Supergirl, and Green Lantern) and ""Clash"" (pitting Captain Marvel and an enraged Superman in an absolutely epic brawl), both episodes from JUSTICE LEAGUE UNLIMITED.",4,"""Holy Moley!

1377026,A26O0T192IBKY1,B003Z8ZCD4,J. Alford,"[15, 16]","DC Universe decided to go ahead and take their DC Showcase features from three of their prior regular full-length releases into a single movie anthology, along with a brand new longer segment, the headliner of Superman/Shazam: The Return Of Black Adam. It also claims to have all three of the previous shorts now in expanded editions, but that is not the case with this as none of the shorts of The Spectre, Jonah Hex, or Green Arrow were changed in any way from their original release. Why they advertised it like this I have no idea, as Warner Bros. is usually pretty straight forward with their promotions and let you know what you're really getting.The first feature is of Superman/Shazam that actually acts as an origin story for Captain Marvel, which is pretty cool since there's never really been anything done of him outside the comic books. BTW, I need to point out that this is the DC Comics' Captain Marvel who is really the original one, and not the Marvel Comics character of the same name. There's a long history behind that involving copyrights and whatnot, that I suggest you look up on your own time. Anyway, it opens with an evil superpowered baddy called Black Adam arriving on Earth after hitchhiking it across the galaxy for the last 5,000 years. Adam was given the powers of the Greek Gods by the wizard Shazam long ago, but went rogue, so the wizard sent him far into space. Now that he's returned, Adam seeks out the next one who will inherit the powers of Shazam. It turns out to be a young orphen named Billy Batson who is currently being interviewed by Clark Kent for a news report on the homeless(even though he has an apartment). Adam shows up and flings Kent through a wall, although conveniently Superman shows up(weird!)to give him a run for his money. Billy manages to escape, and is magically sent to the underground lair of the aging Shazam. He gives Billy the ability to turn into an older version of himself with the powers of flight, speed, and superstrength, with the new name of Captain Marvel. He and Superman team up to take down Black Adam, and with the help of Shazam's talking tiger friend, con the villain into reverting back to his old form which ages him five millenia in a single moment. The mini-movie ends with Billy sorta forgetting the whole concept of a ""secret identity"" when confronted by some punks. This was a great little feature which explored some of the old DC Comics Presents territory where Superman would team up with other heroes in Brave And The Bold fashion. It was wonderfully directed by Joaquim Dos Santos who also did great work in Avatar: The Last Airbender, as well as the other DC Showcase shorts .The first of the three original Showcase stories is The Spectre which is done like a cross between a 70s detective TV show and a grindhouse movie. Jim Corrigan is a police detective who is really the Spirit of Vengenance, and as the Spectre he hunts down the murderers of an ex-girlfriend's rich father. This has some particularly spooky and gripping scenes in it. The Spectre himself is very convincing as voiced by Gary Cole(aka: Harvey Birdman!)Next is Green Arrow, where the Emerald Archer has to rescue a young princess in an airport from assassins. He gets into a chase with several thugs while being shot at by the evil archer, Merlyn The Magnificent. GA bests Merlyn, but is nearly taken out by his client, Count Vertigo. Luckily, Black Canary shows up to bail Arrow out. Neal McDonough was fine as GA, and Malcom McDowell is charismatic as ever as Merlyn.The final bit is Jonah Hex which was phenomenally better than that crappy live-action movie. It's a regular tale of the horribly scarred gunslinger with no supernatural plotpoints thrown in for no good reason. Jonah goes hunting for an outlaw with a large bounty on him, and runs a fowl of a crooked but dead sexy bar owner and her goons. This holds up as being a great Old West tale, while still holding onto the great feel of a nostalgic comic story.

Between the Batman and Superman animated solo series and the Justice League series, they've managed to branch out into features. They've been great thus far (some more than others of course), but one thing that escapes me is why DC didn't see fit to do a full length feature for Shazam. The book ""Monster Society Of Evil"" would have been a great start. I am a huge fan of the ""big red cheese"", and the concept of a child who can become a god with a single word is just fascinating to me. I think it would be interesting to see more of Jerry O'Connell's JLU characterization in a feature length. In the episode ""Clash"", Captain Marvel is an even bigger boy scout than Superman..and is naive and very much a kid in big boy's pants. That child-like naivite and wide eyed optimism is what makes him so endearing. I loved this short and The Spectre short is my fave among the previously released Showcases. I just think DC dropped the ball on this one.I think they really need to explore the DC Universe in future releases. We don't need every other feature to include Superman or Batman.

Not especially original -- takes place in somegritty Western Saloon slash Burlesque House -- but it is tremendously atmospheric, choc fullof ""tough guy"" one-liners and reparte. And the animation is superb (as it is in all the stories).2. Animation: animation is top notch, in all four stories. Done is pretty much the same, highly detailed style as ""Superman/Batman:Apocalpyse"" feature.3. Characters: you get to see a lot of legendary DC comic characters who have not previously made it to the big screen: Black Adam (nicelybrought to life by voice actor Arnold Vosloo), Shazam himself (ie. the wizard), and two of Green Arrow's fiercestopponents, Merlyn and Vertigo. None of these characters have appeared in any of the DC animated features to date (includingall of the Justice League and Justice League Unlimited episodes).Cons: 1. Weak storylines: The story lines for the Black Adam and Green Arrow features are flimsy at best, designed really to showcase the tremendousanimation and nicely choreographed action sequences. The other two are not exactly strong but they are fairly interesting, eachhinging around an intriguing plot twist.2. The Spectre Story: most big DC animated feature fans have already seen this short as it is pretty old. If I remember correctly it was includedwith the Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths DVD. Would have been nice if DC had substituted an original story for this one.Conlclusion: the DVD is not without its flaws, but the Jonah Hex Story is a fun and gripping story, the action in both the Black Adam and Green Arrow stories is tremendous, and the animation in all four stories is top notch.

Durham ""Big Evil""","[56, 61]","Superman/Shazam: The Return of Black Adam, is actually a compilation of DC Universe animated shorts, the main attraction being the main title of course, which is also the only one here that's new.  In Superman/Shazam, the evil and ultra-powerful Black Adam (voiced by The Mummy himself Arnold Vosloo) seeks to take out the new inheritor of the Power of Shazam, which happens to be young Billy Batson (voiced by Zach Callison).  Superman (voiced by Justice League Unlimited Supes George Newbern) shows up to lend a hand as Billy gets a crash course in being Captain Marvel (voiced by Jerry O'Connell), and there's some great action and animation throughout.  As said before, Superman/Shazam is the only new short to be found here, but that's not saying that what's also included is bad either.  The short featuring The Spectre is worth the price of admission in itself, as DC's resident spirit of vengeance (voiced by Gary Cole) exacts brutal retribution upon the guilty in a noir-ish type style, while a short starring Green Arrow (voiced by Neal McDonough) finds the Emerald Archer defending a princess from his arch-nemesis Merlyn (voiced by Malcolm McDowell), and finally a short starring Jonah Hex (voiced by Thomas Jane) finds the scarred bounty hunter taking on a murderous madam (voiced by Linda Hamilton).

1377042,AZXFS8GCTSQ5R,B003Z8ZCD4,NF,"[1, 1]","This isn't a single movie; it's a fairly short main movie (one hour) with three other short videos added to flesh things out. Let's get those other videos out of the way first.The Spectre is a moody film noir story of detective Jim Corrigan investigating a murder as his alter-ego, the Spectre, takes vengeance on the perpetrators. It's very well done, both in mood and in story, and it actually works pretty well as a mystery in its own right. This is one that I think could have been fleshed out a bit more and it might even have worked well as a longer movie.The Green Arrow story has the archer taking on his opposite number, Merlyn, protecting a princess from the assassin. The action is non-stop and the ending a lot of fun. Highly entertaining.And, finally, Jonah Hex takes on a vicious saloon madam and her cohorts, in a saloon where strangers who come in don't come out again.The main movie in the collection is a retelling of the origin of Captain Marvel. A destitute orphan, Billy Batson, has nonetheless managed to maintain his heart and his courage. He has a strange encounter with a homeless man, then goes on to breakfast with reporter Clark Kent, who is writing his story for the readers of the Daily Planet. The two are shocked by a thunderclap as Black Adam makes his presence known by blowing out the windows and wall of the diner in which they're eating.Adam, exiled by the wizard Shazam to the farthest reaches of the galaxy, has made the 5000 year journey back to Earth. He recognizes in Batson the chosen successor and he decides to take him out before the wizard can act. Superman acts to protect Batson but is outmatched by Black Adam. They are evenly matched in strength but Adam's magic, to which Superman is vulnerable, gives him the edge.While Superman takes on Adam, the wizard finally acts, bringing Batson to the Rock of Eternity and explaining his destiny before sending him back to Earth. There are a few plot twists remaining before all is said and done and I won't reveal the ending except to say that I found it strangely unsatisfying and a bit anticlimactic.Overall, though, I found the movie entertaining. The battle sequences were good and it was nice to see Superman take on a foe who really could go toe to toe with him and even beat him. I loved the way they drew Black Adam; they really brought out his deadly menace and his persona. The voice acting wasn't bad, although I have to say that, even though I normally love James Garner, he really wasn't a suitable choice for the wizard Shazam.Aside from the Green Arrow video, all of these are a bit darker in tone than is customary for the WB animation studio. Nonetheless, all of these videos add up to a pretty entertaining collection. The animation is well done, as is the voice acting, with some well-known actors lending their voices. The stories hold up well and all in all it's a worthy addition to the Warner Brothers Animation DCU canon.",4,A mixed bag,1391126400,"01 31, 2014",2014,2939,"[""n't"", 'single', 'movie', 'fairly', 'short', 'main', 'movie', 'one', 'hour', 'three', 'other', 'short', 'videos', 'added', 'flesh', 'things', 'out', 'Let', 'get', 'other', 'videos', 'way', 'first.The', 'Spectre', 'moody', 'film', 'noir', 'story', 'detective', 'Jim', 'Corrigan', 'investigating', 'murder', 'alter-ego', 'Spectre', 'vengeance', 'perpetrators', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'mood', 'story', 'actually', 'pretty', 'well', 'mystery', 'own', 'right', 'one', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'fleshed', 'out', 'bit', 'more', 'might', 'even', 'have', 'worked', 'well', 'longer', 'movie.The', 'Green', 'Arrow', 'story', 'archer', 'taking', 'opposite', 'number', 'Merlyn', 'protecting', 'princess', 'assassin', 'action', 'non-stop', 'ending', 'lot', 'fun', 'Highly', 'entertaining.And', 'finally', 'Jonah', 'Hex', 'vicious', 'saloon', 'madam', 'cohorts', 'saloon', 'where', 'strangers', 'who', 'come', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'out', 'again.The', 'main', 'movie', 'collection', 'retelling', 'origin', 'Captain', 'Marvel', 'A', 'destitute', 'orphan', 'Billy', 'Batson', 'nonetheless', 'managed', 'maintain', 'heart', 'courage', 'strange', 'encounter', 'homeless', 'man', 'then', 'breakfast', 'reporter', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'who', 'writing', 'story', 'readers', 'Daily', 'Planet', 'two', 'are', 'shocked', 'thunderclap', 'Black', 'Adam', 'presence', 'known', 'blowing', 'out', 'windows', 'wall', 'diner', ""'re"", 'eating.Adam', 'exiled', 'wizard', 'Shazam', 'farthest', 'reaches', 'galaxy', 'made', '5000', 'year', 'journey', 'back', 'Earth', 'Batson', 'chosen', 'successor', 'take', 'out', 'wizard', 'can', 'act', 'Superman', 'protect', 'Batson', 'outmatched', 'Black', 'Adam', 'are', 'evenly', 'matched', 'strength', 'Adam', 'magic', 'Superman', 'vulnerable', 'edge.While', 'Superman', 'Adam', 'wizard', 'finally', 'bringing', 'Batson', 'Rock', 'Eternity', 'explaining', 'destiny', 'sending', 'back', 'Earth', 'are', 'few', 'plot', 'twists', 'remaining', 'said', 'done', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'ending', 'say', 'found', 'strangely', 'unsatisfying', 'bit', 'anticlimactic.Overall', 'found', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'battle', 'sequences', 'were', 'good', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'Superman', 'take', 'foe', 'who', 'really', 'could', 'go', 'toe', 'toe', 'even', 'beat', 'loved', 'way', 'drew', 'Black', 'Adam', 'really', 'brought', 'out', 'deadly', 'menace', 'persona', 'voice', 'acting', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'have', 'say', 'even', 'normally', 'love', 'James', 'Garner', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'suitable', 'choice', 'wizard', 'Shazam.Aside', 'Green', 'Arrow', 'video', 'are', 'bit', 'darker', 'tone', 'customary', 'WB', 'animation', 'studio', 'Nonetheless', 'videos', 'add', 'up', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'collection', 'animation', 'well', 'done', 'voice', 'acting', 'well-known', 'actors', 'lending', 'voices', 'stories', 'hold', 'up', 'well', 'worthy', 'addition', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'Animation', 'DCU', 'canon']",Superman/Shazam!: The Return of Black Adam

1377049,A3CDR7VEX55JAD,B003Z8ZCD4,"Red Wood ""critic""","[3, 3]","Pretty much all the reviewers here are the standard comic book fanboy or Michael Bay lover. I would agree with the points of animation being impressive, however ... for the most part - apparently, though, character is not imperative with these ""aficionados"", with the facial gestures here being only a par above 70s Filmation cartoons. For those of you who are concerned with their favorite characters over simply the action involved, you may like the Capt Marvel/Superman/Black Atom short - just likely, not love it. However, as others have mentioned here, such an origin tale is quite rushed at 20 minutes. Also, true Capt Marvel followers will likely not be so impressed by the ""modern"" look of the character, considering how C.C. Beck's great characterization is completely lost here, including both the look and humor of the character.The beauty of Marvel is that he's really just a boy. That opens up some great development, as a boy inside the body of an adult superhero. However, of course, there is really no humor here, as well, just an average kid with gosh oh gee exclamations to boot, narrating his adventures as they occur as if he's a silver age DC hero or something (and yes, that's a knock on the 60s era of National Publications). As a fan of the Big Red Cheese, myself, I would warn here: go for the Justice League Unlimited version, instead. At least it's fun. Nevertheless, I will agree, again, that the animation - and the battle - are pretty good (even if the inclusion of Superman is nonsensical ambivalence-referring to both his placement here as well as his characterization). The other shorts included on this dvd, as others have already mentioned, are on previous sets. I would NOT agree with these reviewers that they are worth the ""price of admission here"", so make your own decision how you view them.Again, the characters are somewhat wooden and its the action that really drives the stories, alone. The Green Arrow entry (which has been called the best thing on this compilation by a number of reviewers) is a decent piece. At least, the character is pretty true to form (so, to be fair, perhaps there is a speck of development on this dvd). However, like all the pieces, the ""tale"" is simply another action one, although not really a bad one (Malcolm McDowell's part, however, is NOT that imperative, with a pretty thankless role in the piece). The more ""adult"" entries here are of the characters The Spectre and Jonah Hex. The former has been one of my favorite comic characters since I read his original golden age stories in 70s DC ""Super Spectaculars"" and such (my favorite comics as a boy). However, I feel there's really more to the character, again, than this short can offer.It's really just a dark piece, lacking any of Corrigan's nature. Basically, this could be any Spectre. Either way, this one is REALLY not for kids. I'll be blunt. Only an idiot would show this to their children. Okay, the last piece, a standard western story with Hex, is really my favorite. Where the emotion is still lacking, for the most part, this one is at least a bit edgy, making this piece ESPECIALLY NOT for kids. All in all, I would give this last one three stars, but just barely. Don't buy this set on that last recommendation, though, whatever you do. Check it out on Netflix instead.

Amazon does not indicate this at all, nor does the case, but the Blu-ray is a two disc set.Now let's go straight into the controversy surrounding this release:1. The only brand new film is indeed a short film, the Superman/Shazam film (which is definitely more about Captain Marvel's origin, than a full team-up feature). About 20 minutes long, and is now my favorite of the short films and is WELL worth the price, alone, in my opinion.  The animation is terrific and personally, I don't think Superman has ever looked better in an animated film.  The voice cast is great, including George Newbern, who played Superman in the Justice League Unlimited series.2. The other 3 shorts were all released on the previous special editions of the recent DCU features, but these are slightly extended and the blu-ray has a commentary on each.3. Another VERY cool special feature are the four animated episodes, each featuring a character from the shorts: Jonah Hex (in Batman Adventures), Captain Marvel (Justice League Unlimited; the one in which he and Superman have a huge brawl!), Green Arrow, and The Spectre (Batman: The Brave and the Bold, ""In the Chill of the Night"" - probably one of the best episodes of that series, featuring Mark Hamill as The Spectre, Kevin Conroy as the Phantom Stranger, and Adam West as Thomas Wayne!).As far as I'm concerned, this collection is well worth the price.",5,Worth the Money!!!,1289692800,"11 14, 2010",2010,1451,"['First', 'thing', 'Blu-ray', 'actually', 'Blu-Ray/DVD', 'combo', 'Amazon', 'not', 'indicate', 'case', 'Blu-ray', 'two', 'disc', 'set.Now', 'let', 'go', 'straight', 'controversy', 'surrounding', 'release:1', 'only', 'brand', 'new', 'film', 'indeed', 'short', 'film', 'Superman/Shazam', 'film', 'definitely', 'more', 'about', 'Captain', 'Marvel', 'origin', 'full', 'team-up', 'feature', '20', 'minutes', 'long', 'now', 'favorite', 'short', 'films', 'WELL', 'price', 'alone', 'opinion', 'animation', 'terrific', 'personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Superman', 'ever', 'looked', 'better', 'animated', 'film', 'voice', 'cast', 'great', 'including', 'George', 'Newbern', 'who', 'played', 'Superman', 'Justice', 'League', 'Unlimited', 'series.2', 'other', '3', 'shorts', 'were', 'released', 'previous', 'special', 'editions', 'recent', 'DCU', 'features', 'are', 'slightly', 'extended', 'blu-ray', 'commentary', 'each.3', 'VERY', 'cool', 'special', 'feature', 'are', 'four', 'animated', 'episodes', 'featuring', 'character', 'shorts', 'Jonah', 'Hex', 'Batman', 'Adventures', 'Captain', 'Marvel', 'Justice', 'League', 'Unlimited', 'one', 'Superman', 'have', 'huge', 'brawl', 'Green', 'Arrow', 'Spectre', 'Batman', 'Brave', 'Bold', 'Chill', 'Night', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'episodes', 'series', 'featuring', 'Mark', 'Hamill', 'Spectre', 'Kevin', 'Conroy', 'Phantom', 'Stranger', 'Adam', 'West', 'Thomas', 'Wayne', '.As', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'collection', 'well', 'price']",Superman/Shazam!: The Return of Black Adam

Joe: Resolute, Avatar: LAB ) has been the director/producer on the DC Showcase Shorts which for me has been great as I'm a big fan of his work( he even got me to watch a short on Green Arrow who I HATE ). What's even better when his name is attached to something you're pretty much about to see some high quality animation that not even a lot of prime time cartoons get other then The Boondocks that is still traditional 2D animation.Shazam/Superman is the origin story of Shazam and Black Adam, now I'm not a Superman fan but I am a fan of when him and Shazam get into their tussles but I am a huge Black Adam fan. Who gets this short rolling as he makes his return to earth after being exiled with two things on his mind, kill the wizard Shazam and his new champion. Which leads us to Billy Bastion who is being interviewed by Clark Kent, some would argue that this sounds wrong but again it's a short film and instead of a long drawn out way to have these two in the same city they just cut to the chase. Joaquim and the writer of this had the perfect idea of what happens when super powered people get near each other in a fight, throw buildings and cars at each other giving us a major fight that hasn't been seen since the JL episode featuring Shazam/Supes( which is a bonus feature on this disc ). The choice of getting Arnold Vosloo( The Mummy ) to voice Black Adam was great as he brings that regal voice to the role, Jerry o' Conell was ok but then he didn't really say much other then grunting.The Specter was a very great throwback to old school horror thanks to Steve Niles and the added choice of having the old film grain was great. While it doesn't have the hand to hand combat Dos Santos is known for he still had people being attacked by objects and you'd never know that this could have been his first time doing so. The music score was also perfect for this and done by the ""Track Team"" who pretty much handled all the music for these shorts, it would be nice to see what these two could do with a full length feature.Green Arrow is pretty much my fav short which is shocking as while I'm not a Superman fan I really can't stand Green Arrow( more of a fan of his son Connor ). It could have also been this was written by Greg Weisman who created Gargoyles and was a head writer for Spectacular Spider-Man but it also helped that he basically let Dos Santos turn up his fight meter to 11( even had Ollie pull off a armbar ). Not shabby that Malcom McDowell lends his voice too bootJonah Hex is pretty much was better then the live action movie and as a fan of the comic it was nice that the cahracter at least took some steps forwards after that disaster. Thomas Jane once again proves that he's perfect for voicing cowboys( having done so inGun) and Linda Hamilton while not saying a whole lot makes sure every time she does it's worth something.There you have it, while these are short( they are short films ) they're still pretty great and either you've seen these already from when they were packaged with other $20 now a days is still a deal",4,Shazam!,1289779200,"11 15, 2010",2010,3095,"['Joaquim', 'Dos', 'Santos', 'JLU', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'Resolute', 'Avatar', 'LAB', 'been', 'director/producer', 'DC', 'Showcase', 'Shorts', 'been', 'great', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'work', 'even', 'got', 'watch', 'short', 'Green', 'Arrow', 'who', 'HATE', 'What', 'even', 'better', 'when', 'name', 'attached', 'something', ""'re"", 'pretty', 'much', 'see', 'high', 'quality', 'animation', 'not', 'even', 'lot', 'prime', 'time', 'cartoons', 'get', 'other', 'then', 'Boondocks', 'still', 'traditional', '2D', 'animation.Shazam/Superman', 'origin', 'story', 'Shazam', 'Black', 'Adam', 'now', ""'m"", 'not', 'Superman', 'fan', 'am', 'fan', 'when', 'Shazam', 'get', 'tussles', 'am', 'huge', 'Black', 'Adam', 'fan', 'Who', 'short', 'rolling', 'return', 'earth', 'being', 'exiled', 'two', 'things', 'mind', 'kill', 'wizard', 'Shazam', 'new', 'champion', 'Which', 'Billy', 'Bastion', 'who', 'being', 'interviewed', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'would', 'argue', 'wrong', 'again', 'short', 'film', 'instead', 'long', 'drawn', 'out', 'way', 'have', 'two', 'same', 'city', 'just', 'cut', 'chase', 'Joaquim', 'writer', 'had', 'perfect', 'idea', 'what', 'when', 'super', 'powered', 'people', 'get', 'other', 'fight', 'throw', 'buildings', 'cars', 'other', 'giving', 'major', 'fight', ""n't"", 'been', 'seen', 'JL', 'episode', 'featuring', 'Shazam/Supes', 'bonus', 'feature', 'disc', 'choice', 'getting', 'Arnold', 'Vosloo', 'Mummy', 'voice', 'Black', 'Adam', 'was', 'great', 'regal', 'voice', 'role', 'Jerry', 'o', 'Conell', 'was', 'ok', 'then', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'say', 'much', 'other', 'then', 'grunting.The', 'Specter', 'was', 'very', 'great', 'throwback', 'old', 'school', 'horror', 'thanks', 'Steve', 'Niles', 'added', 'choice', 'having', 'old', 'film', 'grain', 'was', 'great', ""n't"", 'have', 'hand', 'hand', 'combat', 'Dos', 'Santos', 'known', 'still', 'had', 'people', 'being', 'attacked', 'objects', ""'d"", 'never', 'know', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'first', 'time', 'doing', 'so', 'music', 'score', 'was', 'also', 'perfect', 'done', 'Track', 'Team', 'who', 'pretty', 'much', 'handled', 'music', 'shorts', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'see', 'what', 'two', 'could', 'do', 'full', 'length', 'feature.Green', 'Arrow', 'pretty', 'much', 'fav', 'short', 'shocking', ""'m"", 'not', 'Superman', 'fan', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'Green', 'Arrow', 'more', 'fan', 'son', 'Connor', 'could', 'have', 'also', 'been', 'was', 'written', 'Greg', 'Weisman', 'who', 'created', 'Gargoyles', 'was', 'head', 'writer', 'Spectacular', 'Spider-Man', 'also', 'helped', 'basically', 'let', 'Dos', 'Santos', 'turn', 'up', 'fight', 'meter', '11', 'even', 'had', 'Ollie', 'pull', 'off', 'armbar', 'Not', 'shabby', 'Malcom', 'McDowell', 'voice', 'too', 'bootJonah', 'Hex', 'pretty', 'much', 'was', 'better', 'then', 'live', 'action', 'movie', 'fan', 'comic', 'was', 'nice', 'cahracter', 'least', 'took', 'steps', 'forwards', 'disaster', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'once', 'again', 'perfect', 'voicing', 'cowboys', 'having', 'done', 'so', 'inGun', 'Linda', 'Hamilton', 'not', 'saying', 'whole', 'lot', 'sure', 'time', 'worth', 'something.There', 'have', 'are', 'short', 'are', 'short', 'films', ""'re"", 'still', 'pretty', 'great', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'already', 'when', 'were', 'packaged', 'other', '20', 'now', 'days', 'still', 'deal']",Superman/Shazam!: The Return of Black Adam

The only new short is the title one ""Superman/Shazam"" that is an origin story of Captain Marvel, the Big Red Cheese who can even make Superman look bad. In this short (about 30 minutes), Black Adam arrives on Earth after traversing the galaxy for the past 5,000 seeking to get his revenge against the wizard Shazam and his anointed warrior. As it turns out, Shazam's chosen warrior is a boy named Billy Batson who idolizes Superman. Billy is lives by himself and has to fight street crime every day just to stay alive. Clark Kent interviews him for a special report he's doing about the city's homeless. Well, in the midst of the interview Black Adam shows up and tries to kill Billy. Billy has no idea why, but a magical journey beneath the ground brings Billy to the wizard Shazam who tells him he is his new chosen warrior and gives him the powers of Shazam.""The Spectre"" is a short that was originally released with the JUSTICE LEAGUE: CRISIS ON TWO EARTHS DVD. Narrated by Jim Corrigan, this short has a definite 1970s vibe to it, from the aging of the film, to the style of narration, to the costumes and props seen in the short. This short isn't an origins story, but is an introduction to the character of ""The Spectre"". A movie mogul is murdered and Jim Corrigan wants to know why and who is responsible. Meanwhile, the main suspects in the case start dying off one by one in strange and bizarre ways. The Spectre is the pure spirit of vengeance, so though he's often on the side of good, sometimes his interests conflict with those of a more tempered spirit.""Green Arrow"" was originally released on the SUPERMAN/BATMAN: APOCALYPSE DVD. Like ""The Spectre"", this isn't an origin story either, but does introduce viewers to the character of Green Arrow and what makes him unique from his other hero counterparts. The smugness and cockiness that came with the character in the late 1980s and early 1990s is gone and is replaced with the humility of a man who is all too aware of his limitations of a costumed hero. In this short, Oliver Queen spots the assassin archer Merlyn while on his way to the airport.  As it turns out, Merlyn has been hired to kill a young princess.""Jonah Hex"" was first released on BATMAN: UNDER THE RED HOOD. Like most of the DC Showcase shorts, this isn't an origin story, just an introduction story. Filmed in the style of a 1970s Western, Jonah Hex is hunting for a bounty. The man is wanted dead or alive. Turns out he showed up in town a few days ago, but was never seen again once he went upstairs with the local madam. Actually, no one who goes upstairs with the madam is ever seen from again. Jonah isn't interested in her wares, but he really is interesting in finding his bounty, so he sets a plan into motion.Extras on the DVD include four episodes from various DC cartoons selected by DC animation supervisor Bruce Timm. There's an episode from BATMAN: THE ANIMATED SERIES entitled ""Showdown"" that features Jonah Hex in an extended flashback with Batman only appearing at the beginning and end of the episode; an episode of BATMAN: THE BRAVE AND THE BOLD entitled ""The Chill of the Night"" that features The Spectre and The Phantom Stranger; an episode of JUSTICE LEAGUE UNLIMITED entitled ""Initiation"" that features the recruiting of Green Arrow for the Justice League; and lastly another episode of JUSTICE LEAGUE UNLIMITED entitled ""Clash"" that features the first meeting of Captain Marvel and Superman and a Lex Luthor who seems to have had a transformation of character. There's also a promotion video for BATMAN: THE BRAVE AND THE BOLD DVD sets.Hard core DC animation fans probably already own the previously released DC Showcase shorts featured on SUPERMAN/SHAZAM.

1377065,A2OCJNB6B46OKP,B003Z8ZCD4,"Underground Reborn ""gnome""","[1, 1]","Bruce Timm and company just keep cranking out the hits. Ever since BTAS, I have just been overwhelmed, by everything that these guys have done. One of things that I love about the DCAU, is that while have been given great stories about Batman and Superman and the other big name DC heroes, they always remember the little guy.DC Showcase is a collection of short films that revolve around `other' heroes in the DC universe and give us a story about how they do what they do to keep truth and justice. Three of these shorts have already been given to us in the last 3 DCAU DVD releases, but it is still nice to get them in their own package. Of course the main attraction is the title, `Superman/Shazam: The Return of Black Adam' Captain Marvel isn't what one would call a less popular hero, in fact he is extremely popular. Still, the DCAU has not really given him the screen time he deserves. After the JLU episode `Clash' I was so happy to finally see Captain Marvel as part of the DCAU, now he gets his own origin story. The short is about the length of an actual tv episode and it is great to see Superman witness the creation of Captain Marvel. Brining back George Newbern and Jerry O'Connell to voice their respective characters was awesome, because like in `Clash the two actors work off each other so well. Arnold Vosloo brings a great persona to Black Adam and just having Black Adam in general in the short is great as well, because like Captain Marvel he is another character that never really has been given much time in the spotlight.Along with this new short there are extended versions of the first three shorts. You barley notice the changes, but they do seem longer with a lot less broken dialogue so the flow is much better. `The Spectre', is perhaps my favorite because it uses the old 1970s film scratch effects to make it come off an old cartoon. The casting of Gary Cole to voice The Spectre was pure genius, as he is probably one of the best character actors out there today. It's a great story of revenge and mystery and it works well from beginning to end. `Green Arrow' is the most modern of the shorts. Casting Neil Mcdonugh and Malcom McDowell is a real one two punch. It is a great Green Arrow story of him doing what he does best. It's got great action sequences and witty humor and throwing a little surprise in at the end is just the icing on the cake.  The final short is `Jonah Hex' and its style is a true western. The animation is very brown and earthy like the westerns of old, so the vibe is there. You have a great cast in Thomas Jane, Linda Hamilton and Michelle Tractenberg. It's a very slow story more plot driven than action driven, though the action sequences are great.  It definitely makes up for the bust that the actual film was.The only negative that I have about the package in general is that there were not enough short films. It would have been great to see at least 6 Showcase shorts because there are so many characters that still have yet to be Showcased. While this installment is a tremendous success I really hope that this is the first of many more installments to come.End of Book 2",4,I hope this is the first of many.

The lack of special features is a little annoying. It was nice they had commentaries on all the shorts and had episodes of various DC animated shows for characters that had their own shorts. My favorite short is Green Arrow. This actually got me interested in the character and started reading some of his comics, now he's probably my favorite hero there is. Jonah Hex one was epic.

I mean, I like Superman and Batman as much as the next guy but after awhile they begin to feel stale. Especially if the movies they star in suck big time. So instead of getting a fresh MOVIE starring Captain Marvel, we get a 22 minute short featuring Superman. Yes, Superman, because apparently all other DC superheroes, aside from the big two, SUCK. The short plays out more like the pilot episode for a Shazam! animated series. Sadly, we probably won't even get that. Although the short wasn't bad, it wasn't particularly good either and it felt rushed.Then there's the rehash of already released shorts, which is a good idea if you didn't get the Two-Disc Special Editions of the three craptastic films released this year. (I'm being a bit harsh here, Batman: Under the Red Hood was excellent.) The Green Arrow and Jonah Hex shorts were pretty good, but The Spectre was total crap. It was nice that they TRIED to play it out like a film noir but it failed miserably. I don't know, maybe I'm expecting too much from cartoons.Still, I would've prefered to see animated movies of those ""superheroes"". But no, let's keep making Batman, Superman and JLA features. Because we haven't seen enough of those already. How cool would a Flash movie be? Aquaman? Heck, even Lobo! These DC animated movies are geared towards an older audience anyway, the fans.

All in all, they did a pretty decent job. It's a tiny, tiny short--not even 30 minutes, but beggars can't be choosers if you are a fan of the World's Mightiest Mortal.They did some cool mish-mashing of the Captain Marvel backstory for this release. They had Mr. Tawky Tawny as a servant of the Wizard, straight from Jeff Smith'sShazam!: The Monster Society of Evil.  They kept the original Black Adam origin from the Golden Age, which made me happy (I have never been a fan of the ""Theo Adam"" version). The origin of Captain Marvel, with Billy Batson riding the subway to the Rock of Eternity, was very well done, and both Billy and Captain Marvel looked great.  Throwing in the Clark Kent / Superman angle was odd, but worked for the story. And they gave Black Adam some new powers, including the ability to shoot the magic lighting.  But those small things are easy to forgive.The kicker here is that it is just a short. They really should have done a full-length Captain Marvel movie, and brought in the rest of the Marvel Family as well. DC has been adapting famous works to animation recently, and Jeff Smith's ""Monster Society of Evil"" would have been a perfect springboard for an animated Captain Marvel adventure.  Or they could have brought in Captain Nazi and done the Captain Marvel Jr. origin story. Or ... well, there are 70+ years of stories they could have adapted. But they obviously didn't think the Marvel Family had enough pulling power to justify a feature length film of their own.The rest of the shorts on here are great.  Jonah Hex, Green Arrow, and The Spectre are all somewhat second-stringers just like the Marvel Family, so together they would make this disk a worthy purchase. Except--they are all already available on different DVDs.  If you are a regular buyer of the DCU animated shows, they you probably already own all of these shorts, except for ""The Return of Black Adam."" That was a bit of low-handed dealing by Warner Bros.I was happy they included the Justice League Unlimited short ""Clash"" as a bonus feature. I love that episode, with its Superman / Captain Marvel battle that shows the differences between the two characters. They may have similar powers, but their outlooks and personalities are completely different.For all it shortcomings (pun!) this is a DVD I watch over and over, maybe even more than most of the full-length cartoons.
