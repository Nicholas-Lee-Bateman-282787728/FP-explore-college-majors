1385537,A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I,B00453VHWS,Veil_Lord,"[0, 0]","I used to watch this show way back when it was on late night TV.  I'd program the VCR to record it (yeah, kids this was before Tivo/DVR) and watch it the next day.  Years later, I caught the two movies it was based off of; I liked the series better.The show was an odd little mix of Mission Impossible, MacGyver, and your run of the mill detective show.  The budgets weren't all that great, but the show was very amusing.  The main star was a very likeable fellow and the leading lady was good and some nice eye candy.  It's not fine art or anything, but I think you'll enjoy it.  I might also suggestThe Crow: Stairway to Heavenas another series that probably shouldn't have been good, but was.I have only two real problems.  One, it's a bit expensive for a series nowadays, but eh it's what the market will bare I suppose.  Very hard to find the show anywhere else and even on an auction sites, the best I could find was 1/3 more expensive.  Can't really count it down for that, but it's a consideration if you're deciding whether to get the set.The other more pressing problem, the DVD case was apparently designed by a blind monkey.  It's nearly guaranteed you will scratch your DVDs at least a little taking them in and out and one of the discs had shaken loose and received minor scratches when I opened mine.  We're not talking anything that should stop playback, my computer verified all the discs readable so I'm not worried about it, but you may want to consider alternative packaging if you'll be taking them in and out frequently.",4,Great Series Awful Packaging,1383436800,"11 3, 2013",2013,1542,"['used', 'watch', 'show', 'way', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'late', 'night', 'TV', ""'d"", 'program', 'VCR', 'record', 'yeah', 'kids', 'was', 'Tivo/DVR', 'watch', 'next', 'day', 'Years', 'later', 'caught', 'two', 'movies', 'was', 'based', 'liked', 'series', 'better.The', 'show', 'was', 'odd', 'little', 'mix', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'MacGyver', 'run', 'mill', 'detective', 'show', 'budgets', 'were', ""n't"", 'great', 'show', 'was', 'very', 'amusing', 'main', 'star', 'was', 'very', 'likeable', 'fellow', 'leading', 'lady', 'was', 'good', 'nice', 'eye', 'candy', 'not', 'fine', 'art', 'anything', 'think', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'might', 'also', 'suggestThe', 'Crow', 'Stairway', 'Heavenas', 'series', 'probably', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'good', 'was.I', 'have', 'only', 'two', 'real', 'problems', 'One', 'bit', 'expensive', 'series', 'nowadays', 'what', 'market', 'will', 'bare', 'suppose', 'Very', 'hard', 'find', 'show', 'anywhere', 'else', 'even', 'auction', 'sites', 'best', 'could', 'find', 'was', '1/3', 'more', 'expensive', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'count', 'down', 'consideration', ""'re"", 'deciding', 'get', 'set.The', 'other', 'more', 'pressing', 'problem', 'DVD', 'case', 'was', 'apparently', 'designed', 'blind', 'monkey', 'nearly', 'guaranteed', 'will', 'scratch', 'DVDs', 'least', 'little', 'taking', 'one', 'discs', 'had', 'shaken', 'loose', 'received', 'minor', 'scratches', 'when', 'opened', 'mine', ""'re"", 'not', 'talking', 'anything', 'should', 'stop', 'playback', 'computer', 'verified', 'discs', 'readable', ""'m"", 'not', 'worried', 'may', 'want', 'consider', 'alternative', 'packaging', ""'ll"", 'be', 'taking', 'frequently']",F/X - The Complete First Season (Boxset)
