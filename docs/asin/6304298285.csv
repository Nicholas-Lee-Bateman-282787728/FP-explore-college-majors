413922,A1QC1BTL48JITH,6304298285,"Brian C. Smyth ""B""","[0, 1]",Robin Williams is one of my favorite actors/comedians and has played in some amazing movies. Jack is a story about a boy that has a aging disease. Every year he is alive he ages about 4 years or so. Jack realizes at the age of 10 that he's tired of being home-schooled and wants to go to school so he can interact with other kids his age and make friends. Only problem is that he looks like a 40 year old man. I remember seeing this movie when it first came out and I loved it back then and I still think it's a great movie. It's shows how precious your time on this earth can be. Jack never had the chance to experience the full life he was meant to have. By the time he graduated he was almost 70 years old. Jack is a fun and touching ride throughout and I recommend this movie to everyone.,4,Enjoyable Film,1287446400,"10 19, 2010",2010,792,"['Robin', 'Williams', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors/comedians', 'played', 'amazing', 'movies', 'Jack', 'story', 'boy', 'aging', 'disease', 'year', 'alive', '4', 'years', 'so', 'Jack', 'age', '10', 'tired', 'being', 'home-schooled', 'go', 'school', 'so', 'can', 'interact', 'other', 'kids', 'age', 'make', 'friends', 'Only', 'problem', '40', 'year', 'old', 'man', 'remember', 'seeing', 'movie', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'loved', 'back', 'then', 'still', 'think', 'great', 'movie', 'how', 'precious', 'time', 'earth', 'can', 'be', 'Jack', 'never', 'had', 'chance', 'experience', 'full', 'life', 'was', 'meant', 'have', 'time', 'graduated', 'was', 'almost', '70', 'years', 'old', 'Jack', 'fun', 'touching', 'ride', 'recommend', 'movie', 'everyone']",Jack VHS
413923,A2X17SA4E8V3PU,6304298285,Bstrassell0001,"[0, 0]","Have you ever seen a movie that you felt was underrated, yet understood why it was underrated, at the same exact time?Trust me; I know it sounds weird. While Jack is one of my all-time favorite films, I do not condemn those who did not enjoy it. Some of the humor is very immature, and with the PG-13 rating, it may divert young children dealing with peer pressure from learning the message it offers to all ages: especially to those children who succumb to peer pressure and those who&#8212;with a mental disability, handicap, etc.&#8212;are targeted by cruel children who bully others with these same problems and, in addition, their friends as well.What if I told you, however, that Jack goes by the book: and, in presenting immaturity, presents it in a rebound of joy, for the film&#8217;s central character?I concur with my point below:Jack stars Robin Williams as Jack Powell, a ten-year-old boy with Werner&#8217;s syndrome. If you&#8217;ve never heard of WS, it&#8217;s a form of Progeria, the same illness of Rabbi Harold S. Kushner&#8217;s son that inspired the bestselling book When Bad Things Happen to Good People (see my review): rapid aging which causes a young boy to look like an old man. Jack, born premature at the very beginning of his (fictional) picture, is revealed to have been shaving since he was four years old: and, at the age of ten, lived in a forty-year-old man&#8217;s body! Robin Williams was 44 years old when he signed onto play Jack, and with his physical appearance and knack for comedic and serious acting alike, he nails the role to perfection.With Francis Ford Coppola as our director, Coppola guides Williams/Jack as they enjoy a very childlike life: watching butterflies in a garden, playing pranks against their bullies, and hiding in a box: sometimes out of an attempt to have fun, sometimes out of an attempt to conceal themselves from this cruel world. Very early on, we see Williams/Jack take on a childlike leap of faith: enrolling in a local public school at the advice of his tutor Mr. Woodruff (Bill Cosby in a very sentimental, meaningful role), and facing off against the world as it really is, warts and all.And it is through this that we see young Jack Powell conquer the world not by hiding from it, but by confronting it. His leap of faith proves itself valid when Jack joins a group of his fellow fifth graders in playing basketball against not necessarily their bullies, but intermediate-school &#8220;archenemies,&#8221; and helping them win the victory: more times than just one! Pretty soon, Jack will win the love of not only his fellow classmates, but also a divorced mother of one (Adam Zolotin) who has no clue she&#8217;s flirting with a ten-year old (Fran Drescher)! But he will be up against quite a lot as well, when his body starts to progress past the age of forty, and when he experiences his first romantic heartbreak: his teacher, Miss Marquez (Jennifer Lopez), turning him down for a date at the school dance, understanding that she is the only female at the school who appears to be Jack&#8217;s age at least in height (not in facial appearance, etc.), but realizing&#8212;unlike Jack&#8212;that because she is his teacher and a grown woman, they could both be prosecuted for dating each other, when Jack, in spite of his physical appearance, is only ten years old.I know, I know: already, this sounds a bit like heavy material for a movie that delivers a message about peer pressure to those who are victims of it and those who are targeted for being &#8220;different&#8221; (both categories apply to me). Some of the humor even seems like it&#8217;s more directed solely towards men than men and women alike, a negative aspect to a film with a message for all ages: and, along with them, all sexes as well. However, if you think back to when you were in the fifth grade, and you remember the people it was considered &#8220;uncool&#8221; to hang out with, it&#8217;s very easy to overlook Jack&#8217;s immaturity. The immaturity is not here for the sake of tooting its own horn; rather; it&#8217;s here to bring joy to the faces in the audience, in seeing Robin Williams/Jack Powell finally finding a place to call home among other boys his age. (Note: Williams himself was frequently outcast in school while growing up.) In all of this, Francis Ford Coppola reminds us that it&#8217;s on the inside that counts; with the adventures he puts Robin Williams/Jack Powell and their friends through, and teaches us to cherish life and look for large and small miracles alike, wherever we go.

413924,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,6304298285,Caleb Williams,"[4, 4]","Robin Williams, although an immensely funny and energetic comedian, has the raw acting talent to make you truly believe in his characters. He can emotionally engage you and allows for his supporting cast to remain prominent in his films without being overshadowed by the big characters that he plays. Patch Adams & Mrs. Doubtfire are two very fine examples of how Robin Williams can present an immensely funny character, yet retains a level of depth and reality that allow for the hysterical laughter without sacrificing the emotional importance of what his films are ultimately about. He achieves this just as well in Jack.The film is based around the main character, Jack. He is a child born with a rapid aging disability like that of the real condition known as Progeria. The parents are naturally shocked and upset by this news, but make a pledge to allow him as good a life as possible. Fast forward a few years and we see a child in the body of a grown man (Robin Williams) who has been secluded from the outside world by his parents to protect him from the cruelties and judgments of the real world. His home school tutor Lawrence (Bill Cosby) recommends to Jacks parents that he should be put into a public school so he can socialise and make friends.Anybodies first day of school is a terrifying one, but for Jack it's even more so thanks to him being in the body of a fully grown man entering an elementary school. Naturally his fellow classmates are a bit wary of this stranger in their classroom and keep well away whilst inventing stories. Mrs. Marquez (Jennifer Lopez), his teacher, warms quickly to Jack and strongly wants him to make friends and be accepted by his classmates. After being asked to join a team in a basketball game because of his height, he quickly becomes part of a group of friends who start to look past his appearance and recognise the kid within him.This is an immensely sweet and heart warming film and is personally one of my favourites starring the comic legend that is Robin Williams. It's largely unrecognised on the mainstream film stage and I would love it to get more recognition than it did then and does now. It's up there with the likes of Mrs. Doubtfire and Patch Adams. Although it's not as blatantly funny, it's more so an emotional piece with a strong message to deliver to us all about acceptance of the personality within everybody. Looking past the appearance and accepting people, warts and all.Directed by the legend of Francis Ford Coppola, there's no denying that this would have been an immensely enjoyable movie going piece. The inclusion of comedy legend Bill Cosby is also a delight and although he doesn't have a largely comic prominence, it's still a great thing to see him in the film. This is one of Jennifer Lopez' first movies and although I'm not crazy over her acting, she doesn't do a bad job overall. Williams is the true gem though and truly creates a believable and sweet character that we're all hoping will succeed in making friends.I would highly recommend this to any fans of Robin Williams as it's truly one of his greatest.",4,A Sweet And Gentle Movie,1241222400,"05 2, 2009",2009,3104,"['Robin', 'Williams', 'immensely', 'funny', 'energetic', 'comedian', 'raw', 'acting', 'talent', 'make', 'truly', 'believe', 'characters', 'can', 'emotionally', 'engage', 'supporting', 'cast', 'remain', 'prominent', 'films', 'being', 'overshadowed', 'big', 'characters', 'Patch', 'Adams', 'Mrs.', 'Doubtfire', 'are', 'two', 'very', 'fine', 'examples', 'how', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'can', 'present', 'immensely', 'funny', 'character', 'yet', 'level', 'depth', 'reality', 'allow', 'hysterical', 'laughter', 'sacrificing', 'emotional', 'importance', 'what', 'films', 'are', 'ultimately', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'Jack.The', 'film', 'based', 'main', 'character', 'Jack', 'child', 'born', 'rapid', 'aging', 'disability', 'real', 'condition', 'known', 'Progeria', 'parents', 'are', 'naturally', 'shocked', 'upset', 'news', 'make', 'pledge', 'allow', 'as', 'good', 'life', 'possible', 'Fast', 'forward', 'few', 'years', 'see', 'child', 'body', 'grown', 'man', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'who', 'been', 'secluded', 'outside', 'world', 'parents', 'protect', 'cruelties', 'judgments', 'real', 'world', 'home', 'school', 'tutor', 'Lawrence', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'Jacks', 'parents', 'should', 'be', 'put', 'public', 'school', 'can', 'socialise', 'make', 'friends.Anybodies', 'first', 'day', 'school', 'terrifying', 'one', 'Jack', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'thanks', 'being', 'body', 'fully', 'grown', 'man', 'entering', 'elementary', 'school', 'Naturally', 'fellow', 'classmates', 'are', 'bit', 'wary', 'stranger', 'classroom', 'keep', 'well', 'away', 'whilst', 'inventing', 'stories', 'Mrs.', 'Marquez', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'teacher', 'warms', 'quickly', 'Jack', 'strongly', 'make', 'friends', 'be', 'accepted', 'classmates', 'being', 'asked', 'join', 'team', 'basketball', 'game', 'height', 'quickly', 'part', 'group', 'friends', 'who', 'start', 'look', 'appearance', 'recognise', 'kid', 'him.This', 'immensely', 'sweet', 'heart', 'warming', 'film', 'personally', 'one', 'favourites', 'starring', 'comic', 'legend', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'largely', 'unrecognised', 'mainstream', 'film', 'stage', 'would', 'love', 'get', 'more', 'recognition', 'did', 'then', 'now', 'up', 'there', 'likes', 'Mrs.', 'Doubtfire', 'Patch', 'Adams', 'not', 'as', 'blatantly', 'funny', 'more', 'so', 'emotional', 'piece', 'strong', 'message', 'deliver', 'acceptance', 'personality', 'everybody', 'Looking', 'appearance', 'accepting', 'people', 'warts', 'all.Directed', 'legend', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'denying', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'immensely', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'going', 'piece', 'inclusion', 'comedy', 'legend', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'also', 'delight', ""n't"", 'have', 'largely', 'comic', 'prominence', 'still', 'great', 'thing', 'see', 'film', 'one', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'first', 'movies', ""'m"", 'not', 'crazy', 'acting', ""n't"", 'do', 'bad', 'job', 'overall', 'Williams', 'true', 'gem', 'truly', 'believable', 'sweet', 'character', ""'re"", 'hoping', 'will', 'succeed', 'making', 'friends.I', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'fans', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'truly', 'one', 'greatest']",Jack VHS

413935,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,6304298285,Jason,"[2, 3]","One gloomy night in August, Brain Powell and Karen Powell (Brain Kerwin and Diane Lane) decided they would like to be parents.  Two months later at a Halloween party Karen realized that the baby was ready to get out after only two months.  Had the baby ripped out Aliens-style, this movie would have no doubt been better; however, it wasn't meant to be.  Nonetheless, the Halloween-spawn came forth as Karen delivered what essentially turned out to be the Wolfman.It turns out that Karen delivered her baby, Jack (Robin Williams), seven months early because he's aging at four-times the rate of a normal human.  What was left out of the explanation, however, was that along with the quadrupled growth rate, Jack had hair growth at roughly 25 times the normal rate.  That's the only explanation for Jack ending up looking like a 40 year old wearing a fur coat or an extra for Planet of the Apes.  Given Williams' resemblance to the guy one step from the right on the evolutionary chart, I suppose the premise is not all that unbelievable.  Williams playing an innocent, character who diddles and fidgets like a child, on the other hand, is just awkward.Anyway, by the time Jack is ready for school he looks like a middle-aged adult.  He eventually ends up going to public school where he's horribly out of place, and it's much worse than you would expect for a movie in which Robin Williams plays a grade-schooler.  In all the appropriate places, where a child interacts with parents, a heartwarming pause is felt by all.  Except anyone with a pulse.  Essentially he's the proverbial turd in a punchbowl.  It's just Robin Williams hamming it up for the camera for 2 hours, basically the same thing he did in the ""Don't Worry, Be Happy"" video - a grown man willing to flush his dignity down the toilet in order to do ridiculous things that only he finds amusing.Thank goodness for the combined efforts of the talented and gorgeous Diane Lane, and the sexy, nubile school teacher played by Jennifer Lopez.

413954,A3TOQAMJURAYFC,6304298285,Roland Dark,"[8, 24]","""Jack"" is an atrocious little chunk of excrement that is about as funny as a toothache!In ""Jack"" we find Robin Williams as a boy who just happens to grow four times the normal rate physically (when he is five he has the body of a 20 year old, when he is ten he has the body of a 40 year old, etc). However, his mental growth matches his actual age, leading to obvious problems.The concept is truly an original and fascinating one with the potential for many laughs. Unfortunately, ""Jack"" is poorly executed, relying heavily on tasteless crudity devoid of wit.Robin Williams would seem to be the perfect pick for this boy stuck in an adult's body. However, Robin is a major disappointment; Roger Ebert hit the nail on the head in his review in which he points out that this is Robin Williams being Robin Williams, not Robin Williams playing a ten year old with a 40 year old's body.

One night a couple named Brain Powell and Karen Powell (Brain Kerwin and Diane Lane) are at a costume party. When thier baby is ready to be born. But the baby is not due for another 7 months. Karen gives birth to a boy which they name Jack. And doctors tell them that the baby was born early because his body is aging 4 times the normal rate. And if this goes on until Jack is 10 years old, that he will be a full grown 40 year old man. So 10 years later Jack (Robin Williams) is a full grown man.
