I have only watched episodes 1 through 12 but so far am enjoying the show.  Now I can see where the comparison for Firefly does come in, but don't be fooled the two shows have very little in common.  I am a huge fan of Firefly, and this show stands alone.The Bad: The graphics and special effects at times is not the best and the acting at some points (in a couple episodes) is bad. The show just began as if you knew the whole history; there was no real build up.  The US order of the episodes is not the correct one; which is slightly annoying.The Good: The thing I loved about this show was the emotions of the characters. If it was the pain Dante felt because of his son, or the fear he felt for Percy. Or even Percy's frustrations for how protective Dante was towards her; plus the relationship between them was great. This was a great addition to this show. As was Luc she really stood out as a mother figure and friend for Percy. One thing I really enjoyed was the beginning of the episode, with Rudolpho DeLuna.  His transmission always goes with the episode; he and Caravaggio add a bit of humor to the show.But it would have been nice to see how Dante got into Bounty Hunting, him taking in Percy, meeting Luc, and so on.

1028317,A1H0DVDALK4APZ,B000JLTRHW,Darrell A. Lane,"[1, 4]","What is wrong with Canadian TV? I bought this for three bucks at Half Price Books, thinking, oh, cool, a sci fi tv series that I haven't seen, and, look, it takes place in our solar system. Micahel Pare's a nice actor (loved him in Eddie and the Cruisers) and there are two cute chicks in here ta boot! The cover art looked interesting but I learned from novels not to judge a book by its cover. Unfortunately, this series lives up to that slogan. Slow, tedious and dumb. I grew bored with the not-too-subtle sexual overtures of the ""smart"" girl mechanic shennigans; let's see, breakout the prisoner (or irrationally sympathize), seduce him, punch him and save the ship. Psycho chick studied after that damn Wesley Crusher from Star Trek the Next Generation. The CGI is limited, yeah, but I can overlook that, what with me being a B-movie fan and all, but the takes are too long so you get all kinds of time to gander at poor visual effects. The show's opening credits sucked thirteen flavors of Rancor rear and the music put me to sleep, twice in fact. Pare phoned his scenes in from somewhere around Jupiter, I think. Oh, and that annoying boss of Pare's, the Australian?-wannabe-Italian mafioso and his idiotic bad signal, was infuriatingly mundane and made me wish that someone from the Soprano's (or Mad Max) would show up and cap his poor display of an appearance. Canadian TV ruined Hitchhiker, Ray Bradbury Theater and Alfred Hitchcock Presents, and turned the second season of War of the Worlds into sludge so I shouldn't be too surprised; their sense of wonder and awe seem to be asleep and their plotting is far too leisurely and does not invoke deep intellect (which I'm sure some beatnik pot smoker would argue) but rather an indication of apathy.I wanted to love this, wanted to believe it could overcome its drag against against solar winds, but I've been disappointed in love before...lol.Yes, there IS profanity and nudity but I'm an old hat there so that too is mundane.I only spent three bucks on this commatose effort so I'm good, but my expectations were far superior to the final product.(sigh)",1,StarUgh!,1357430400,"01 6, 2013",2013,2116,"['What', 'wrong', 'Canadian', 'TV', 'bought', 'three', 'bucks', 'Half', 'Price', 'Books', 'thinking', 'oh', 'cool', 'sci', 'fi', 'tv', 'series', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'look', 'place', 'solar', 'system', 'Micahel', 'Pare', 'nice', 'actor', 'loved', 'Eddie', 'Cruisers', 'are', 'two', 'cute', 'chicks', 'here', 'ta', 'boot', 'cover', 'art', 'looked', 'interesting', 'learned', 'novels', 'not', 'judge', 'book', 'cover', 'Unfortunately', 'series', 'up', 'slogan', 'Slow', 'tedious', 'dumb', 'grew', 'bored', 'not-too-subtle', 'sexual', 'overtures', 'smart', 'girl', 'mechanic', 'shennigans', 'let', 'see', 'prisoner', 'irrationally', 'sympathize', 'seduce', 'punch', 'save', 'ship', 'Psycho', 'chick', 'studied', 'damn', 'Wesley', 'Crusher', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'CGI', 'limited', 'yeah', 'can', 'overlook', 'what', 'being', 'B-movie', 'fan', 'are', 'too', 'long', 'so', 'get', 'kinds', 'time', 'gander', 'poor', 'visual', 'effects', 'show', 'opening', 'credits', 'sucked', 'thirteen', 'flavors', 'Rancor', 'rear', 'music', 'put', 'sleep', 'twice', 'fact', 'Pare', 'phoned', 'scenes', 'somewhere', 'Jupiter', 'think', 'Oh', 'annoying', 'boss', 'Pare', 'Australian', '-wannabe-Italian', 'mafioso', 'idiotic', 'bad', 'signal', 'was', 'infuriatingly', 'mundane', 'made', 'wish', 'someone', 'Soprano', 'Mad', 'Max', 'would', 'show', 'up', 'cap', 'poor', 'display', 'appearance', 'Canadian', 'TV', 'ruined', 'Hitchhiker', 'Ray', 'Bradbury', 'Theater', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'Presents', 'turned', 'second', 'season', 'War', 'Worlds', 'sludge', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'surprised', 'sense', 'wonder', 'awe', 'seem', 'be', 'asleep', 'plotting', 'far', 'too', 'leisurely', 'not', 'invoke', 'deep', 'intellect', ""'m"", 'sure', 'beatnik', 'pot', 'smoker', 'would', 'argue', 'rather', 'indication', 'apathy.I', 'wanted', 'love', 'wanted', 'believe', 'could', 'overcome', 'drag', 'solar', 'winds', ""'ve"", 'been', 'disappointed', 'love', 'lol.Yes', 'IS', 'profanity', 'nudity', ""'m"", 'old', 'hat', 'there', 'so', 'too', 'mundane.I', 'only', 'spent', 'three', 'bucks', 'commatose', 'effort', ""'m"", 'good', 'expectations', 'were', 'far', 'superior', 'final', 'product', 'sigh']",Starhunter - The Complete Series

The premise is interesting and the universe is original, but it just doesn't live up to it's potential. The budget was obviously lacking. Sets are generally small and uninspired, the CGI work is marginal, and the special effects distract from rather than enhance the story.Worse than that is the lackluster acting. The intro snippets by the crew's bounty hunter agent are clever, but the only real cast members that draw you in are Percy and (with less consistency) Dante.The real trouble with the show is that despite a fairly original premise and a bold real-space setting, it just comes out as a Firefly wanna-be. As if regular plot and aesthetic similarities weren't enough, the composition of the ensemble reflects Joss Whedon's masterpiece pound-for-pound (Mal=Dante, Kalee=Percy, Zoe=Luc).

I know it bears a much greater superficial resemblance to Firefly, in that it involves a commercial spaceship moving from one dangerous encounter to another.  But that's where the similarity with Firefly ends and the similarity with Torchwood begins.  Where Firefly, for all the danger and violence the crew encounters, is essentially an upbeat show presenting the triumph of good over evil, Starhunter - like Torchwood - presents a rather bleak picture of the real world, in which the good guys may triumph, but at a cost almost greater than whatever victory they attain.  And, as with Torchwood, it makes for a riveting experience watching the stories unfold with unexpected twists and turns that render the inevitable defeat of the bad guys as almost anti-climactic.  In only one of the stories, in fact - Cell Game - was the ending satisfying in the usual SciFi sort of way.The three main characters are among the most unique SciFi characters the genre has to offer.  The first two episodes I despised Percy (the Tanya Allen character) as a meddling brat; but, as the season unfolded, she actually became the most sensible and most useful in getting the crew through whatever they encountered.  Both Dante (Michael Pare) and Luc (Claudette Roche) have overriding obsessions that render them almost useless at times; and they think nothing of risking everything on any chance, however slim, to gratify those obsessions.The stories are great, with excellent writing, extremely bizarre villains and, in my opinion, very effective special effects - but then, I'm not a special effects freak who finds neat computer gimmicks the be-all and end-all.  But the show's not for people who need happy endings to make watching a worthwhile experience.

Each of these unedited episodes begins with a pointless monologue by the loathsome, cynical Rudolpho, who funds the journeys of the Tulip, so named because these are the letters of its full name which haven't worn off yet.  The crew consists of Dante Montana, bounty hunter, who's just doing this for cash while trying to find his son; Lucretia (Luc), their ""security expert""; and Dante's teenage niece Percy, the ship's engineer (before Kaylee made girl engineers cool.)  Add in a holographic AI Caravaggio for...additonal comic relief, I guess.World building, plots, dialogue are all sub-par.  The one redeeming feature of the series is Percy.  If you like the show at all, it will probably be because of her.  The idea of an immature female character may not appeal to everyone, but she's very entertaining to watch.  Certainly, in comparison to the rest of the cast.Many of the episodes are complete in themselves (and thus can be seen in almost any order) but some of the episodes involve ""The Divinty Cluster,"" which forms the actual main subplot to the series (the other subplot being Dante's search for his son Travis.)  The Divinity Cluster subplot doesn't really reach a satisfying conclusion in this series.  The series ends in a cliffhanger, leading in to Starhunter 2300 (which I own but haven't watched yet.)There are no extras apart from a few previews.  Ratings-wise, there are a few minor swear words and some almost-kinda-sorta nudity for brief moments in one episode, and some brief topless nudity in another episode.  PG-13ish.Do I recommend it?

And I probably will.Flashback time... I rented the box set as a cheap show to watch, after finding it at a record store for about the price it is here on Amazon (currently 10 bucks). So I got it for no better reason than it seemed like campy scifi I could watch with my dad (who doesn't like scifi unless it's old 1950s monster film style). Well, this does have a fair bit of camp, each episode starts with this narration from a guy straight out of Hemmingway, ""I'm a bounty hunter, but it's just something that I do. I'm really looking for something that was stolen from me. Ten years ago, they took my son. As I search, there are signs that something is happening. That humanity is about to change. But I won't be distracted. How do you find one small boy In such a large universe? I'm not sure. But I have to keep trying.""Yea. It's a bit goofy, and the first episode I got of this show was completely out of order (I checked wikipedia), making it sort of confusing at first. Not to mention, I watched it at night when I was about to fall asleep, so I missed some of the action. And then suddenly, the show just sorta clicked, and I couldn't stop watching it. Why? The characters.The basic premise of two bounty hunters, an engineer, and a holographic computer system on a mission of rescue (with at least one having a secret agenda), with episodic characters, lent itself for pretty heavy flushing out of each character. The captain is haunted by the kidnapping of his son, and the loss of his late wife (neither of which turn out to be what he expected them to be, by the finale of the first season). The backup hunter, is actually driven by a conspiracy called the Divinity Cluster (something to do with humans having godlike extra alien DNA as their last few genomes, so yea supernatural powers), and is working for an organization. Tanya Allen steals the show as the engineer niece of the captain, with her quirky personality that gets steadily more isolated, paranoid, and slightly sociopathic (but in a funny way) as the show goes on. And finally we have a snooty British holograph that controls the ship's systems, and provides exposition and a bit of comic relief.This show is NOT for everyone (as noted from some of the sour reviews), but the way the characters play off each other (especially Travis, in later episodes) makes it a hidden gem.",4,"Not for everyone, but an underrated series.",1368316800,"05 12, 2013",2013,2444,"[""'m"", 'currently', 'debating', 'shell', 'out', 'seventy', 'bucks', 'season', 'two', 'series', 'probably', 'will.Flashback', 'time', 'rented', 'box', 'set', 'cheap', 'show', 'watch', 'finding', 'record', 'store', 'price', 'here', 'Amazon', 'currently', '10', 'bucks', 'got', 'better', 'reason', 'seemed', 'campy', 'scifi', 'could', 'watch', 'dad', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'scifi', 'old', '1950s', 'monster', 'film', 'style', 'Well', 'have', 'fair', 'bit', 'camp', 'episode', 'narration', 'guy', 'straight', 'Hemmingway', ""'m"", 'bounty', 'hunter', 'just', 'something', 'do', ""'m"", 'really', 'looking', 'something', 'was', 'stolen', 'Ten', 'years', 'ago', 'took', 'son', 'search', 'are', 'signs', 'something', 'happening', 'humanity', 'change', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'distracted', 'How', 'do', 'find', 'one', 'small', 'boy', 'large', 'universe', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'have', 'keep', 'trying.', 'Yea', 'bit', 'goofy', 'first', 'episode', 'got', 'show', 'was', 'completely', 'order', 'checked', 'wikipedia', 'making', 'sort', 'confusing', 'first', 'Not', 'mention', 'watched', 'night', 'when', 'was', 'fall', 'asleep', 'missed', 'action', 'then', 'suddenly', 'show', 'just', 'sorta', 'clicked', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'watching', 'Why', 'characters.The', 'basic', 'premise', 'two', 'bounty', 'hunters', 'engineer', 'holographic', 'computer', 'system', 'mission', 'rescue', 'least', 'one', 'having', 'secret', 'agenda', 'episodic', 'characters', 'lent', 'pretty', 'heavy', 'flushing', 'character', 'captain', 'haunted', 'kidnapping', 'son', 'loss', 'late', 'wife', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'what', 'expected', 'be', 'finale', 'first', 'season', 'backup', 'hunter', 'actually', 'driven', 'conspiracy', 'called', 'Divinity', 'Cluster', 'something', 'do', 'humans', 'having', 'godlike', 'extra', 'alien', 'DNA', 'last', 'few', 'genomes', 'so', 'yea', 'supernatural', 'powers', 'working', 'organization', 'Tanya', 'Allen', 'show', 'engineer', 'niece', 'captain', 'quirky', 'personality', 'steadily', 'more', 'isolated', 'paranoid', 'slightly', 'sociopathic', 'funny', 'way', 'show', 'finally', 'have', 'snooty', 'British', 'holograph', 'ship', 'systems', 'exposition', 'bit', 'comic', 'relief.This', 'show', 'NOT', 'everyone', 'noted', 'sour', 'reviews', 'way', 'characters', 'play', 'off', 'other', 'especially', 'Travis', 'later', 'episodes', 'hidden', 'gem']",Starhunter - The Complete Series

The overall arc for the whole season is mostly confusing and seems to lose certain aims only to get them back a couple episodes later.The series is watchable and it's not painful to watch, but I didn't find it very fulfilling or satisfying.

It is not for everyone, but I found it very entertaining and actually have watched the entire series a couple times. I like the characters. Percy is a hoot and Dante, as played by Michael Pare is excellent. Luc is cool, and very funny in a subtle way. In fact, most of the 'cool' about this series is the subtle humor. No laugh tracks, no super dramatic music. It relies more on a good story line and good acting. Think of it as a much drier version of Firefly. Actually this first season predates Firefly.

The ships are CGI, and obviously such - PSII or X-Box quality realtime renders are comparable - but are well handled and don't blow the story, and further, were pretty good for the era. For those unfamiliar, the protagonists are bounty hunters in a non-FTL future, with a terraformed Mars, and plenty of humans across the Sol system; the captain is looking for his son, who was kidnapped in a raid.
