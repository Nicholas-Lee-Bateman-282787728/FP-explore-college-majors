1537884,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B007TAAZP4,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[5, 5]","Hendrix (Mandela Van Peebles) is a high school student. He works at parties as a DJ to earn money to buy a car. He has done the guy thing and entered into a ""first one to loose their virginity"" contest with 4 friends. Meanwhile he wants to date Cheyenne (Simone Battle) the Phoebe Cates of this teen movie. Cheyenne's dad (Michael Jai White) is a policeman and won't allow his daughter to date anyone below a 3.5 grade average. Hendrix makes an arrangement to have Cheyenne tutor him so he can get his grade point average up and take her to the prom.The film also has some party rappers, an up skirt cell phone cam, a school project that interfaces with poor people, and a token 20 year old near thug (Y.G. who pays C.C.) in class. Snoop Dog listed in the credits has a minor role.Peebles has no problem quoting Malcolm X (just called Malcolm in the film to fool us white folk) and gives a grand lecture on consumerism, aimed at both Hendrix and the audience. The acting and story line were just fine, it just seems to be underdeveloped. Maybe I have just outgrown these films.PARENTAL GUIDE: F-Bomb, off screen sex, no nudity. 2 1/2 stars",3,MINIMUM EFFORT MEANS MINIMUM WAGE,1344643200,"08 11, 2012",2012,1139,"['Hendrix', 'Mandela', 'Van', 'Peebles', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'parties', 'DJ', 'earn', 'money', 'buy', 'car', 'done', 'guy', 'thing', 'entered', 'first', 'one', 'loose', 'virginity', 'contest', '4', 'friends', 'Meanwhile', 'date', 'Cheyenne', 'Simone', 'Battle', 'Phoebe', 'Cates', 'teen', 'movie', 'Cheyenne', 'dad', 'Michael', 'Jai', 'White', 'policeman', 'wo', ""n't"", 'allow', 'daughter', 'date', 'anyone', '3.5', 'grade', 'average', 'Hendrix', 'arrangement', 'have', 'Cheyenne', 'tutor', 'can', 'get', 'grade', 'point', 'average', 'up', 'take', 'prom.The', 'film', 'also', 'party', 'rappers', 'up', 'skirt', 'cell', 'phone', 'cam', 'school', 'project', 'poor', 'people', 'token', '20', 'year', 'old', 'thug', 'Y.G', 'who', 'C.C', 'class', 'Snoop', 'Dog', 'listed', 'credits', 'minor', 'role.Peebles', 'problem', 'quoting', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'just', 'called', 'Malcolm', 'film', 'fool', 'white', 'folk', 'grand', 'lecture', 'consumerism', 'aimed', 'Hendrix', 'audience', 'acting', 'story', 'line', 'were', 'just', 'fine', 'just', 'be', 'underdeveloped', 'Maybe', 'have', 'just', 'outgrown', 'films.PARENTAL', 'GUIDE', 'F-Bomb', 'off', 'screen', 'sex', 'nudity', '2', '1/2', 'stars']",N/A
