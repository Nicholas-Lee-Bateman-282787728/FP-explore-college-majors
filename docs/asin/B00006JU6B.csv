718871,A8MVGWI5ZKNQ5,B00006JU6B,Daisy Brambletoes,"[1, 1]","One of the only two in the so-called ""complete"" Gilbert & Sullivan series(and it isn't complete at all) which actually has all of the complete dialog and music, even though the film, especially in Act Two, seems to have been performed at breakneck speed in order to squeeze everything in. However, in all fairness, there were some rather interesting things also done in this performance.  Set more or less in Meiji Japan, we see hot-air balloons, a contemporary railway, Pish-Tush dressed in the odd semi-western finery so often seen in late Victorian Japan - and most delightful, Nanki-Poo actually carrying a trombone.  I have mixed feelings about William Conrad as the Mikado, who really couldn't carry a tune in a bucket and stumbled over the lyrics as well. All the same, he looked wonderful, more like a huge Chinese Manadrin than the Emperor of Japan, but his disappointed delivery of ""Bless my heart, my son."" was worth all the rest of it.  My own personal disappointment, however, was Clive Reville as Koko.  He is a veteran stage comedian with impressive credits, including the original Emperor Palpatine in ""The Empire Strikes Back"" - but he simply looked and acted too much like Mel Brooks to convince me that he was Koko.  Don't get me wrong - I enjoyed this production.

He may never win a Grammy, but in this production of the Operetta, he does quite a decent job.  Even if you are not a fan of Opera, Gilbert and Sullivan is still easy to enjoy because their storylines are not as depressing as regular operas. Also, the English dialogue makes the story much more accessible to a wider audience.

L'hoir,"[1, 1]","I borrowed this from the library, and on the whole, I enjoyed it, because it is one of my favourite G & S Operettas.Clive Revill, who inhabits the role of Koko like a second skin, is splendid in the role of the Lord High Executioner of Titipu. His split-second comic timing makes him seem an authentic Savoyard, as members of the original G & S Light opera company were known. Although their voices are up to the task, the other members of the company do not seem quite as at home in their roles.The 'Eighties film has a curiously dated look, although the costumes and set (and clever gimmicks of Katisha's hot-air  balloon and the Mikado's steam-powered train) are beautiful. The choreography seems unnecessarily busy, with actors waving the long sleeves of their kimonos wildly, and moving aimlessly back and forth and around in circles. If you want a the feel of what an actual D'Oyley Carte production was actually like, watch the delightful 1999 film of ""Topsy Turvy"", which depicts rehearsals and entire finished scenes of ""The Mikado."" (This film prompted me to pull ""Topsy Turvy"" off the shelf and watch it again. A delightful experience!).The singing is generally excellent (Conrad excepted, but he's not impossible), and the music will make you feel ridiculously happy. One can see why these comic operas were hits. Sullivan's musical nods to Giuseppe Verdi in the choral ensembles are delightful (one wonders whether he was sending up the style of his popular Italian contemporary), and practically every musical number is memorable. One is guaranteed to be humming ""Miya sama"", ""The Flowers that Bloom in the Spring, Tra-La"" or ""Tit-Willow"" for hours!It's a shame that Acorn Media did not see fit to provide the subtitles for this largely enjoyable production, because WS Gilbert's libretto for ""The Mikado"" ranks among his wittiest; its Victorian notions about parliamentary politics and beauty are also surprisingly up-to-date.  As another viewer has remarked, unless one is familiar with the words, one will likely not understand them. And if you don't understand ""There's a fascination frantic in a ruin that's romantic, do you think that your sufficiently decayed?"" with which Koko reluctantly woos Katisha, you have missed out on Gilbert's delicious wit.And as beautiful as the melodies are, complete understanding of the Gilbert half of the team is essential for the full enjoyment of Sullivan's music.",4,Enjoy the Music and KoKo!,1334275200,"04 13, 2012",2012,2421,"['borrowed', 'library', 'whole', 'enjoyed', 'one', 'favourite', 'G', 'S', 'Operettas.Clive', 'Revill', 'who', 'role', 'Koko', 'second', 'skin', 'splendid', 'role', 'Lord', 'High', 'Executioner', 'Titipu', 'split-second', 'comic', 'timing', 'seem', 'authentic', 'Savoyard', 'members', 'original', 'G', 'S', 'Light', 'opera', 'company', 'were', 'known', 'voices', 'are', 'up', 'task', 'other', 'members', 'company', 'do', 'not', 'seem', 'quite', 'home', 'roles.The', ""'Eighties"", 'film', 'curiously', 'dated', 'look', 'costumes', 'set', 'clever', 'gimmicks', 'Katisha', 'hot-air', 'balloon', 'Mikado', 'steam-powered', 'train', 'are', 'beautiful', 'choreography', 'unnecessarily', 'busy', 'actors', 'waving', 'long', 'sleeves', 'kimonos', 'wildly', 'moving', 'aimlessly', 'back', 'forth', 'circles', 'want', 'feel', 'what', 'actual', ""D'Oyley"", 'Carte', 'production', 'was', 'actually', 'like', 'watch', 'delightful', '1999', 'film', 'Topsy', 'Turvy', 'rehearsals', 'entire', 'finished', 'scenes', 'Mikado', 'film', 'prompted', 'pull', 'Topsy', 'Turvy', 'shelf', 'watch', 'again', 'delightful', 'experience', '.The', 'singing', 'generally', 'excellent', 'Conrad', 'excepted', 'not', 'impossible', 'music', 'will', 'make', 'feel', 'ridiculously', 'happy', 'One', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'comic', 'operas', 'were', 'hits', 'Sullivan', 'musical', 'nods', 'Giuseppe', 'Verdi', 'choral', 'ensembles', 'are', 'delightful', 'one', 'was', 'sending', 'up', 'style', 'popular', 'Italian', 'contemporary', 'practically', 'musical', 'number', 'memorable', 'One', 'guaranteed', 'be', 'humming', 'Miya', 'sama', 'Flowers', 'Bloom', 'Spring', 'Tra-La', 'Tit-Willow', 'hours', 'shame', 'Acorn', 'Media', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'fit', 'provide', 'subtitles', 'largely', 'enjoyable', 'production', 'WS', 'Gilbert', 'libretto', 'Mikado', 'wittiest', 'Victorian', 'notions', 'parliamentary', 'politics', 'beauty', 'are', 'also', 'surprisingly', 'up-to-date', 'viewer', 'remarked', 'one', 'familiar', 'words', 'one', 'will', 'likely', 'not', 'understand', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'fascination', 'frantic', 'ruin', 'romantic', 'do', 'think', 'sufficiently', 'decayed', 'Koko', 'reluctantly', 'Katisha', 'have', 'missed', 'out', 'Gilbert', 'delicious', 'wit.And', 'as', 'beautiful', 'melodies', 'are', 'complete', 'understanding', 'Gilbert', 'half', 'team', 'essential', 'full', 'enjoyment', 'Sullivan', 'music']",N/A

This DVD is worth buying for many good reasons. Some lyrics were heard for the very first time by us because we could hear the words and even read their lips on those wonderful close-ups. The sets and costumes were good and the direction was fine. CLIVE REVILL was kind of ugly and unsuited to the role as KOKO but we laughed anyway. His costume was the worst. The Lord High Executioner had a rich bass voice and THE CHORUS was the best we have ever heard!!!!!! Katisha was great! William Cannon as the Mikado does not have a good voice, but he put in a decent performance. The young leads were fine.The City Center guys were a lot better as Pooh-bah and Koko, but their Wandering Minstrel is bald and homely and waaaay too old, so this DVD has given us a younger and cuter [and taller] HERO with a delightful voice. The film quality is great. Light years better than the old old Kenny Baker one which we also enjoyed because it was funnier.

There are no captions of any kind.I was surprised to see Joseph Conrad cast as the Mikado; I didn't know he could sing.  As it turns out, he will never be known for it, but he acquitted himself well in the few solos he had.  John Stewart, as Nanki-Poo, was excellent, but the best singing was from the two female leads, Kate Flowers and Anne Collins, who played Yum-Yum and Katisha respectively.In spite of the truly poor choreography and cheap-looking sets and costumes, this is the best production of The Mikado that I have seen to date, but I would very much like to see the complete play done by the actors from the movie, Topsy-Turvy (another recommended movie, but not for children).
