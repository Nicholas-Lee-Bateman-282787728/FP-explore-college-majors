Obviously this is an old movie and seems like a throwback to the old Hollywood epics like The Ten Commandments. Making a movie about the birth of Islam is a difficult proposition due to restrictions about portraying early leaders like Muhammad and Ali. This director gets around it by showing other characters and only suggesting the presence of Muhammad by having the camera take his point of view and playing soothing music. To a degree this lessens the impact of the movie but it is a workable trade off. This movie does a decent job of portraying the conditions under which Islam was born but it does gloss over a few details here and there. Overall, it gives a good visual perspective of what happened while at the same time trying to highlight some of the societal goals of Islam also. I showed this movie in class and my students seemed to like it. If you are interested in the history of Islam, check this one out.",5,Old but decent movie on a topic that doesn't have many.,1298678400,"02 26, 2011",2011,993,"['are', 'lot', 'good', 'reviews', 'movie', 'so', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'mine', 'short', 'Obviously', 'old', 'movie', 'throwback', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'epics', 'Ten', 'Commandments', 'Making', 'movie', 'birth', 'Islam', 'difficult', 'proposition', 'due', 'restrictions', 'portraying', 'early', 'leaders', 'Muhammad', 'Ali', 'director', 'showing', 'other', 'characters', 'only', 'suggesting', 'presence', 'Muhammad', 'having', 'camera', 'take', 'point', 'view', 'playing', 'soothing', 'music', 'degree', 'impact', 'movie', 'workable', 'trade', 'off', 'movie', 'decent', 'job', 'portraying', 'conditions', 'Islam', 'was', 'born', 'gloss', 'few', 'details', 'here', 'there', 'Overall', 'good', 'visual', 'perspective', 'what', 'happened', 'while', 'same', 'time', 'trying', 'highlight', 'societal', 'goals', 'Islam', 'also', 'showed', 'movie', 'class', 'students', 'seemed', 'are', 'interested', 'history', 'Islam', 'check', 'one', 'out']",The Message VHS
444355,ACXHNOC6L8LUO,6305020086,Artist & Author,"[23, 57]","I can give this movie a 'B' for entertainment value, but it gets a 'D' for historical and theological accuracy.  The doctrines the characters express to be that of Islam make it seem that this is just another version of Judaism or Christianity.  It completely ignores those doctrines of violence endemic with Islam.  Also, according to 'The Oxford History of Islam' (available as I write this through Amazon.com), very little is known of Mohammed's actual life and ministry (p.6), so much of what is believed to be his story is based on traditional yarns that were developed long after he died.  Therefore, this movie should be taken as an approved Islamic narrative that may or may not reflect actual history.And that is one of my biggest problems with the film - it is at odds with every scholarly history of Islam I've read.  Because most of the surrounding tribes already believed in one God, Mohammed was tolerated by most neighboring tribes.  It was mainly with his own tribe, one that was polytheistic, that he had the problems shown in this movie.  He was more accepted in Medina, with its large Jewish population, and used his years there, after his protector-uncle died, (622-632) to consolidate his power.  Those who challenged Mohammed's claim to being a prophet, and his dogmas, were dealt with harshly - with the loss of their property, enslavement or execution.  So much for his doctrines of charitable treatment of people, humility, etc.  Eventually, when he had gathered enough followers to form an army, he went to a neighboring tribe and demanded that they convert to Islam.  When they refused, the historical record reports that his army killed about 10,000 tribesmen.  Then, his followers used this example of what happens to those Mohammed viewed to be infidels to convince other tribes to convert to Islam.This movie accurately shows that Mohammed's people were frequently, if not almost always, fighting for their religion.  What is dishonest about the movie is that it was mainly against his own tribe he fought for defense; in virtually all other cases he was involved in offensive battles to further Islam.  This is an attribute of Islam that continues to this day; just look at the declarations of fundamentalist Moslems today.Violence in Islam is not only focused on non-Muslims; just look at the different factions of Islam in any newspaper today.  Indeed, in the history of Islam, there have been only one or two Caliphs who died a natural death; all others were murdered.  [This would be somewhat equivalent to only one or two Popes dying a natural death; all others being killed by a Cardinal who then made himself Pope.]  So, my main objection with this movie is that it shows Islam as just trying to survive in a hostile world, when in reality it was Islam that used violence and  barbarity to advance its cause.Therefore, if one is interested in a good yarn, one can watch this movie in that light and enjoy it.  One can watch it to get some sense of what life might have been like in Seventh Century Arabia.  However, if one is interested in historical accuracy, they should read the many scholarly histories of Islam.",3,"A Good Yarn, But Historically Inaccurate",1153353600,"07 20, 2006",2006,3155,"['can', 'give', 'movie', 'B', 'entertainment', 'value', ""'D"", 'historical', 'theological', 'accuracy', 'doctrines', 'characters', 'express', 'be', 'Islam', 'make', 'just', 'version', 'Judaism', 'Christianity', 'completely', 'doctrines', 'violence', 'endemic', 'Islam', 'Also', 'according', ""'The"", 'Oxford', 'History', 'Islam', 'available', 'write', 'Amazon.com', 'very', 'little', 'known', 'Mohammed', 'actual', 'life', 'ministry', 'p.6', 'so', 'much', 'what', 'believed', 'be', 'story', 'based', 'traditional', 'yarns', 'were', 'developed', 'long', 'died', 'Therefore', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'taken', 'approved', 'Islamic', 'narrative', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'reflect', 'actual', 'history.And', 'one', 'biggest', 'problems', 'film', 'odds', 'scholarly', 'history', 'Islam', ""'ve"", 'read', 'most', 'surrounding', 'tribes', 'already', 'believed', 'one', 'God', 'Mohammed', 'was', 'tolerated', 'most', 'neighboring', 'tribes', 'was', 'mainly', 'own', 'tribe', 'one', 'was', 'polytheistic', 'had', 'problems', 'shown', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'accepted', 'Medina', 'large', 'Jewish', 'population', 'used', 'years', 'there', 'protector-uncle', 'died', '622-632', 'consolidate', 'power', 'who', 'challenged', 'Mohammed', 'claim', 'being', 'prophet', 'dogmas', 'were', 'dealt', 'harshly', 'loss', 'property', 'enslavement', 'execution', 'So', 'much', 'doctrines', 'charitable', 'treatment', 'people', 'humility', 'etc', 'Eventually', 'when', 'had', 'gathered', 'enough', 'followers', 'form', 'army', 'went', 'neighboring', 'tribe', 'demanded', 'convert', 'Islam', 'When', 'refused', 'historical', 'record', 'reports', 'army', 'killed', 'about', '10,000', 'tribesmen', 'Then', 'followers', 'used', 'example', 'what', 'Mohammed', 'viewed', 'be', 'infidels', 'convince', 'other', 'tribes', 'convert', 'Islam.This', 'movie', 'accurately', 'Mohammed', 'people', 'were', 'frequently', 'not', 'almost', 'always', 'fighting', 'religion', 'What', 'dishonest', 'movie', 'was', 'mainly', 'own', 'tribe', 'fought', 'defense', 'virtually', 'other', 'cases', 'was', 'involved', 'offensive', 'battles', 'further', 'Islam', 'attribute', 'Islam', 'day', 'just', 'look', 'declarations', 'fundamentalist', 'Moslems', 'today.Violence', 'Islam', 'not', 'only', 'focused', 'non-Muslims', 'just', 'look', 'different', 'factions', 'Islam', 'newspaper', 'today', 'Indeed', 'history', 'Islam', 'have', 'been', 'only', 'one', 'two', 'Caliphs', 'who', 'died', 'natural', 'death', 'others', 'were', 'murdered', '[', 'would', 'be', 'somewhat', 'equivalent', 'only', 'one', 'two', 'Popes', 'dying', 'natural', 'death', 'others', 'being', 'killed', 'Cardinal', 'who', 'then', 'made', 'Pope', ']', 'So', 'main', 'objection', 'movie', 'Islam', 'just', 'trying', 'survive', 'hostile', 'world', 'when', 'reality', 'was', 'Islam', 'used', 'violence', 'barbarity', 'advance', 'cause.Therefore', 'one', 'interested', 'good', 'yarn', 'one', 'can', 'watch', 'movie', 'light', 'enjoy', 'One', 'can', 'watch', 'get', 'sense', 'what', 'life', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'Seventh', 'Century', 'Arabia', 'However', 'one', 'interested', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'should', 'read', 'many', 'scholarly', 'histories', 'Islam']",The Message VHS

Wilson ""Atheen""","[149, 160]","Years ago after my first visit to Egypt, the University of Minnesota sponsored a film festival of Egyptian made films and this was one among them.  Although it features film stars with whom many of us will already be familiar, Irene Pappas, Anthony Quinn and Michael Ansara, it was directed by a Moslem director,  Moustapha Akkad, and has the stamp of approval of the Al Azhar Mosque and University (the oldest University in the world and an institution much respected in the Islamic world for its Koran scholarship).While it carries a religious message for Islamic people--in fact I saw parts of it again on Saudi TV as part of the Ramadan season's celebration while I  was working in Tabouk--it also explains in a sympathetic way for Western viewers many of the basic tenets of Islam.  It is as moving a story in its own way as the stories of the New Testament are for Christians, and it portrays the essence of what Moslems believe about Mohamed and their faith.  The simplicity and straight forwardness of the tale as it portrays the sacrifices of plain people for their convictions and the ultimate triumph of good over evil will appeal to anyone with a sense of fair mindedness regardless of ones religious convictions.  The light in which it places Christians cannot fail to impress.  Mohamed's more vulnerable followers are told to seek asylum with the King of Abyssinia (modern day Ethiopia), because as a Christian king he was their ""brother"" and bound by the ""book"" to protect them from their oppressors, which indeed he does!  Nor are the Jews spoken ill of in the tale.The actual cinematography is a little dated, and the story can be a little postured, but no more than any other film of the 1960-1970s.  How many can sit through a John Wayne western without a little smile, whether of nostalgia or of amusement, and yet the color, pageantry and triumph of the good guys in the face of blatant evil is still a treat.  The film is a beautiful work, and the story is moving,  informative and  well worth viewing.

Muhammad claims to have seen a vision of the Angel Gabriel and calls to the people of Makkah to worship the one God - not the 360 idols of the Kaaba. Muhammad and his followers meet secretly, despite bitter opposition, and the leaders of Makkah respond with persecution, forcing the new Muslims to leave and find sanctuary in Medina. Then follows the story of the adult life of Muhammad to the return to Makkah, the destruction of the idols in the Kaaba and the restoration of the holy place to the worship of the one God.Hollywood's Syrian-born Moustapha Akkad produced and directed this feature film starring Anthony Quinn and Irene Papas. Music was composed and conducted by Maurice Jarre. Intended to promote interfaith understanding of Islam, it is the recounting of the life story of the Prophet Muhammad. Filmed entirely in Muslim countries, it was objected to in a few, although the Prophet Muhammad himself is never shown. It is highly acceptable to the American Muslim audience and will bring nods of approval from parents of Muslim youngsters in the classroom. Its real ""Hollywood"" appeal - big budget, special effects, location shooting (one of the late 1970s ""epics"") - make it an educational film that will rivet student attention. (Includes a 45 minute trailer that describes the making of the epic - itself a valuable tool for student understanding.) Think of it as a primary source.

444359,ACC1SLND21RI6,6305020086,Breyel,"[12, 15]","I must salute Mustapha Akkad for making an English language film on Islam and casting world-renowned actors Anthony Quinn, Michael Ansara and Irene Papas in prominent roles. This was a wonderful marketing strategy on his part to generate mass appeal for the film. It's unfortunate this never materialised into a blockbuster when it was released in 1976, at least in the US anyway.I for one was ignorant of its existence until some Muslim students from university mentioned its screening at an art theatre in Denver, back in the early 1980's. Like most non-Muslim Americans the film meant little to me at the time. It wasn't until I emigrated to Malaysia that I did see it and realised what a thoroughly informative film it was...and still is.Whether you are Muslim or non-Muslim, ""The Message: The Story of Islam"" is an excellent primer to understanding the life of the Prophet Mohammad, the early history of Islam and the basic beliefs of the religion.In keeping with Islamic teachings, even the Prophet Mohammad is never seen. For some viewers unaware of this fact, it might seem strange and contribute to the occasional ""wooden"" performance of the actors. Despite this and having seen countless Islamic-related films dealing with the Prophet Mohammad, his family and close associates in Arabic and Bahasa Malaysia, I can assure you the message is more relevant than the craftwork of the actors or director. ""The Message: The Story of Islam"" is no different in this respect.Previously released under the title  ""Mohammad: Messenger of God"", this 30th anniversary edition comes with two DVDs. One is in the English language and the other in Arabic, which I suppose was originally offered in the respective regions where these languages are spoken. The Arabic version is of particular interest should you prefer to listen to the linguistic nuances of the selected Quranic verses. There is also an interactive menu on each DVD, allowing the viewer to see a documentary on the making of the film and a running commentary from the director -- if you wish to hear -- while viewing the film.

444361,A6YJXMMWFZR5P,6305020086,Clyde A. Dodge,"[25, 30]","This DVD product is not up to the standards of current DVDs. It's most glaring omission is English subtitles. Fortunately, it's the kind of film that sets a stately pace (to match the  solemnity of the topic), and the actors speak in crisp, easily understandable voices...most of the time.Since the original film was done in two versions, I think it is about time that they rereleased this in a Special Edition. It would be interesting to see the Arabic version of the film with English subtitles. As it is, you only get a hint of the second version in the Arabic trailer on the current product.I also found the stills gallery irksome. It isn't a gallery, but a slide show, with loud music playing throughout. It would be nice if there were an option to view the stills without all the sturm and drang.The film itself is a decent religious/historical drama. Most of the acting is quite well done. There are some truly moving moments in this film: my favorite was when a former slave speaks up and defends a possible convert who is having doubts. What he has to say about the issue of doubts struck me as one of the wisest things I have ever heard in a film about any religion.Another reviewer here lauded the battle scenes, but I would have to disagree with that. The battle scenes were almost laughable by today's standards. Yet, that is really not so important within the context of the whole. This is a film about the birth of one of the world's major religions, not &quot;Lord of The Rings.&quot;I recommend this film to anyone interested in a dramatic treatment of the birth of Islam. I think it would be particularly useful to teachers teaching about this period of world history, as crucial elements can be presented easily in isolation on the DVD, whereas with the VHS version you would have some fearsome fast forwading to do.Dare I say this last part? I found the refusal to show Mohammed somewhat gimmicky. Whenever Mohammed is in a scene, the camera shifts to a point of view looking out of his eyes, accompanied by some eerie music to indicate the shift in perspective.

It is also shown on TV in most Muslim countries during the month of Ramadan which should give you some idea of the importance that this film has in the Muslim world.One point though, you will not see the Prophet as it is considered blasphemous in Islam (something which is explained at the beginning of the film) and this may come across as a little strange to anyone who is used to seeing films depicting Jesus or Moses but you do get used to it.The acting also can be a little 'corny' and 'wooden' at times but much of that has to do with the era the film was made. The DVD also comes with the Arabic version of the film which has slightly different scenes (for those who are native speakers of Arabic) and a short documentary showing the making of the film. On that note I wished they would have had better subtitles options(Turkish for example would have been useful) and a few other European languages as a film of this importance really needs to have more exposure (this film has been dubbed into Turkish and I am sure into a few other languages why didn't they have this option on the DVD?)Still, the film covers all of the major events in the life of the Prophet and several of the major figures (Blial, Hamza etc) I would have given this film 5 stars were it not for the lack of language choice and subtitles.Otherwise well worth watching.",4,Interesting film,1123718400,"08 11, 2005",2005,1773,"['film', 'watch', 'wish', 'know', 'something', 'history', 'Islam', 'and/or', 'life', 'Prophet', 'Muhammad', 'having', 'read', 'many', 'books', 'are', 'market', 'reading', 'Martin', 'Lings', 'book', 'good', 'start', 'film', 'been', 'approved', 'Sunni', ""Shi'ite"", 'scholars', 'thus', 'can', 'be', 'assured', 'pretty', 'balanced', 'view', 'life', 'Prophet', 'agreed', 'schools', 'Islamic', 'thought', 'also', 'shown', 'TV', 'most', 'Muslim', 'countries', 'month', 'Ramadan', 'should', 'give', 'idea', 'importance', 'film', 'Muslim', 'world.One', 'point', 'will', 'not', 'see', 'Prophet', 'considered', 'blasphemous', 'Islam', 'something', 'explained', 'beginning', 'film', 'may', 'come', 'little', 'strange', 'anyone', 'who', 'used', 'seeing', 'films', 'depicting', 'Jesus', 'Moses', 'do', 'get', 'used', 'it.The', 'acting', 'also', 'can', 'be', 'little', ""'wooden"", 'times', 'much', 'do', 'era', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'DVD', 'also', 'Arabic', 'version', 'film', 'slightly', 'different', 'scenes', 'who', 'are', 'native', 'speakers', 'Arabic', 'short', 'documentary', 'showing', 'making', 'film', 'note', 'wished', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'better', 'subtitles', 'options', 'Turkish', 'example', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'useful', 'few', 'other', 'European', 'languages', 'film', 'importance', 'really', 'have', 'more', 'exposure', 'film', 'been', 'dubbed', 'Turkish', 'am', 'sure', 'few', 'other', 'languages', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'option', 'DVD', 'Still', 'film', 'major', 'events', 'life', 'Prophet', 'several', 'major', 'figures', 'Blial', 'Hamza', 'etc', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'film', '5', 'stars', 'were', 'not', 'lack', 'language', 'choice', 'subtitles.Otherwise', 'well', 'worth', 'watching']",The Message VHS

It is a film from the 70s, but has the feel of an early 60s film. Not everyone's taste.If you want to learn more about Islam, I think this film is a great start. You do get an understanding of the society that Mohammed was revolting against and you learn some basic facts about his life. As an example, I now realise that the role of women was improved by Islam compared to pre-Islam times. So I don't think Mohammed tried to put down women. Off course, the situation today is different because the western society has given women many more rights. So today Islam does not seem very equal in my view. Another thing I learnt is how little of what Muslims believe today is clearly spelt out in the Koran, but instead is described in texts (hadith) written several hundred years after Mohammed's death.The film is directed by a Muslim, but I don't think it is propaganda. It is in fact probably the best way to understand the appeal of Islam to many people of the region. The idea that race and status does not matter in the eyes of Allah is indeed a powerful idea. This becomes very clear in the film.Some people here on amazon criticize the film because it doesn't show a balanced view of Mohammed. Without being an expert. I think this is valid criticism. Some areas not covered well are: The role of women in Islam. The way Mohammed's early followers gained resources. The relationship between Muslims and Christians/Jews. These are serious omissions if you want to understand Islam.The director wanted to make a film so that audiences could better understand the positive sides of Islam. I don't know what to make of the irony that a Muslim suicide bomber killed the director and his daughter seemingly at random in 2005.In conclusion, I think this is a five star film. Please play tribute to the director by buying the DVD.If you want to understand current Islam, there is obviously a lot more to understand.

Yes, the acting was passable, and the writing was interesting- but it made for interesting historical fiction. It was certainly based on the lives of real people, but the comparison with reality ended there. It became more a propagandistic whitewash of true events, not corresponding to historical criticism, the Qur'an, or the Hadith. For an interesting story, it's OK. But for a movie that claims to be history it falls far short.There are glaring omissions throughout the movie- such as the wives and concubines of Mohammed (pbuh), Mohammed's (pbuh) raids during the months of truce, and the raids he initiated on caravans throughout the year, the Battle of the Trench, and the presence of strong Jewish tribes in Yathrib (later Medina). Often issues that would not paint a sympathetic view of Mohammed (pbuh) were obscured or left out. The movie suggests that the followers of Mohammed (pbuh) would not initiate attacks and tried to avoid fighting- but this directly contradicts the historical record, the Qur'an, and the Hadith! Indeed, the Muslims became strong through the acquiring of wealth from raids, an accepted practice of the time, as long as it did not occur during the months of truce. The movie portrays his followers as going so far as to say that they are men of peace. At the same time the attacks on Mohammed's (pbuh) followers in Mecca are greatly exaggerated, as there is little evidence of real physical persecution. In the movie Mohammed (pbuh) is seen immediately as the leader of all of Medina, with all Medinans immediately submitting to Islam. But the town was called Yathrib, a Jewish name, for a reason- the Jewish tribes remained there until they were expelled much later by the Muslims. And Mohammed (pbuh) was seen as the leader of his followers only and as an unbiased arbitrator within Yathrib for a long time, as first among chiefs rather than ruler, gaining true civil authority only towards the end of his life.Lastly the act of not showing the image or displaying the voice of Mohammed (pbuh) greatly detracts from the artistic merit of the movie, making many scenes confusing and frankly silly, as everyone looks in the direction of the camera for the unseen audience to respond. The end result is ironically to create an almost god-like portrayal of Mohammed (pbuh) as he is an unseen powerful presence throughout the movie.If you are looking to spend an evening viewing fiction and only have to spend a couple bucks, this movie is OK.

The writing is stilted and tedious, the acting only passable (even by fine actors), and the movie suffers from prophet-worship.  Mohammed is portrayed as a disembodied figure and the other actors either stick their faces into the camera for very one-sided conversations or simply announce to each other what the prophet said.Movies about Moses, David, Jesus, and other religious figures portray their subjects as human, keeping God as the disembodied voice or burning bush or what-not.  In this movie Mohammed takes this invisible form, instead of being humanized by an actor, and therefore is equated with God.If The Ten Commandments had shown Moses-the-disembodied-voice telling Pharaoh to free the slaves, or if films about Jesus portrayed him only as a golden light (the way a recent Disney movie did Mohammed), the producers would have been accused of deifying those characters.  It would be better to show the Prophet as a man than to make him the equivalent of the burning bush.Also, it makes the script very ponderous, difficult for the actors, and quite repititious:  &quot;Hey, Mohammed says God said this!&quot;  Hey, the Prophet says God said that!&quot; is heard over and over again.

I own a copy of the video and will be buying the DVD before my video disintegrates! I have to disagree with a lot of the negative reviews posted here. Islam does not permit the portrayal of the face of the Prophet (the movie also chooses not to show the faces of Ali and Abu-Bakr, the first Imam/fourth Caliph and the first Caliph, respectively), so the person who compares this film to Harvey  is demonstrating a complete lack of understanding about something that is of great importance to Muslims. I wish someone would make a film about Jesus that had the sense of reverence not to try to portray someone sent by God. I think the way this aspect is handled is one of the most intelligent things about the movie. Zaid and Hamzah are frequently viewpoint characters, and the viewer (as an artistic and religious choice) is left to intuit Muhammad's words. It must have been an incredible artistic challenge.I agree some elements are omitted (eg, the Battle of the Trench). Akkad did not have the amount of time Peter Jackson had to present Lord of the Rings; to do a dramatic presentation in less than three hours, you have to leave something out. I am not a Muslim but object to the suggestions that this is a whitewashed job. Scholars like Martin Lings and Hassan Balyuzi present a picture quite consonant with this one. I love the way you feel the thrill of the early Muslims (who, like Christ's early followers, were drawn from the poor and meek) when someone appears with a freshly dictated surah of the Holy Qur'an, and the sense of tension when they know they must be very circumspect about the fact that they are even meeting. I love the depiction of Bilal chanting the first addhan. I love the emphasis on the message of peace and the brotherhood of man and on the spiritual discipline so central to this revelation. I'm in the USA, and I am appalled that for many of my countrymen, Islam is a religion that tells people to fly planes into public buildings. Islam's central message is not unlike that of Jesus. I agree a little historical reading (say the history section of Pickthall's The Meaning of the Glorious Koran) would not be misplaced, but I think for Westerners, this is an excellent introduction. It also gives some context for study of the Qur'an itself --- a tough read for any raised on the more linear text of a book like the Bible, but the true miracle of the Islamic revelation.",5,Brilliant introduction to Islam's message and the life of the Prophet,1196726400,"12 4, 2007",2007,2484,"['saw', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'Christmas', 'day', 'mid-70', 'own', 'copy', 'video', 'will', 'be', 'buying', 'DVD', 'video', 'have', 'disagree', 'lot', 'negative', 'reviews', 'posted', 'here', 'Islam', 'not', 'permit', 'portrayal', 'face', 'Prophet', 'movie', 'also', 'not', 'show', 'Ali', 'Abu-Bakr', 'first', 'Imam/fourth', 'Caliph', 'first', 'Caliph', 'respectively', 'person', 'who', 'film', 'Harvey', 'demonstrating', 'complete', 'lack', 'understanding', 'something', 'great', 'importance', 'Muslims', 'wish', 'someone', 'would', 'make', 'film', 'Jesus', 'had', 'sense', 'reverence', 'not', 'try', 'portray', 'someone', 'sent', 'God', 'think', 'way', 'aspect', 'handled', 'one', 'most', 'intelligent', 'things', 'movie', 'Zaid', 'Hamzah', 'are', 'frequently', 'viewpoint', 'characters', 'viewer', 'artistic', 'religious', 'choice', 'left', 'intuit', 'Muhammad', 'words', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'incredible', 'artistic', 'challenge.I', 'agree', 'elements', 'are', 'omitted', 'eg', 'Battle', 'Trench', 'Akkad', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'amount', 'time', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'had', 'present', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'do', 'dramatic', 'presentation', 'less', 'three', 'hours', 'have', 'leave', 'something', 'am', 'not', 'Muslim', 'object', 'suggestions', 'whitewashed', 'job', 'Scholars', 'Martin', 'Lings', 'Hassan', 'Balyuzi', 'present', 'picture', 'quite', 'consonant', 'one', 'love', 'way', 'feel', 'thrill', 'early', 'Muslims', 'who', 'Christ', 'early', 'followers', 'were', 'drawn', 'poor', 'meek', 'when', 'someone', 'freshly', 'dictated', 'surah', 'Holy', ""Qur'an"", 'sense', 'tension', 'when', 'know', 'must', 'be', 'very', 'circumspect', 'fact', 'are', 'even', 'meeting', 'love', 'depiction', 'Bilal', 'chanting', 'first', 'addhan', 'love', 'emphasis', 'message', 'peace', 'brotherhood', 'man', 'spiritual', 'discipline', 'so', 'central', 'revelation', ""'m"", 'USA', 'am', 'appalled', 'many', 'countrymen', 'Islam', 'religion', 'people', 'fly', 'planes', 'public', 'buildings', 'Islam', 'central', 'message', 'not', 'Jesus', 'agree', 'little', 'historical', 'reading', 'say', 'history', 'section', 'Pickthall', 'Meaning', 'Glorious', 'Koran', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'misplaced', 'think', 'Westerners', 'excellent', 'introduction', 'also', 'context', 'study', ""Qur'an"", 'tough', 'read', 'raised', 'more', 'linear', 'text', 'book', 'Bible', 'true', 'miracle', 'Islamic', 'revelation']",The Message VHS

Honoring the Muslim tradition of not portraying Muhammad, the filmmaker took on the interesting challenge of making a film in which we never see or hear the main character. So we get reports on the words and deeds of Muhammad from other characters, or the camera's point of view is Muhammad's point of view.The film is a faithful portrayal of the Muslim understanding of the story of Muhammad. (Its ""accuracy and fidelity"" were approved by groups of Islamic scholars, both Sunni and Shia.) You'll understand the story better if you already know a bit about the life of Muhammad, but even if you know nothing at all about Muhammad and Islam, you'll be able to follow the basic storyline.The film is longer than necessary (I thought the battle scenes could've been trimmed down), and something about its 1970s aesthetic occasionally had me expecting Captain Kirk to beam down from Enterprise, but some of the cinematography is beautiful, and all in all, I found this film a great way to learn about Muhammad and the origins of Islam.I've used large excerpts of this video in teaching Islam, and the students like it.

of never showing the Prophet, or giving his character voice [ Except thru a narrator ( The great voice of Richard Johnson ), or by characters relaying his message, and orders, as required by the script ].This was supposedly in accordance with Muslim beliefs, and meant that his seven wives, his daughters, and his sons-in-law could not be depicted.This left Mohammed's uncle, played by Quinn, as the central character from the perspective of the newly forming religion.The characters speak to the Camera when talking, and reacting, to The Prophet, and the Point of view of The Prophet is seen from the cameras view of what is in front of it, especially when he moves around.This film was made to give voice to a Moderate Islamic perspective of a religion that its practitioners felt was misunderstood, or unjustly characterized by the West.It fits squarely in the tradition of all the Biblical films familiar to western audiences in the 50's, 60's, and 70's.The more unsavory facts of the life of Mohammed, the founding of his religion, and the contents of the Koran, of course, are nowhere to be found, but I don't hold that against the filmmakers of the time.To say that they would not be able to get away with that in the current climate is a waste of time, just as saying that making a reverent film equivalent, in quality, and unfamiliar perspective, to The Last Temptation of Christ would result in protests, and Fatwahs, of the vehemence of the reaction to the recent Danish Cartoons.The Script does its job in an intelligent, and thoughtful, manner.The acting, by its 3 famous leads is uniformly excellent, as are the performances of an international cast of Europeans, Arabs, Westerners, and African-Americans, in other important speaking roles.The most unusual of this last was seeing early Christianity portrayed by Black actors as the King, Advisors, and courtiers of a Kingdom bordering the Arab territories.The Cinematography is breathtaking, and the several full-scale battles are as well executed as any comparable ones of the time.The Score was well deserving of its Oscar nomination.The scenes shown under the closing credits are a reminder that Islam, radical, and moderate, is a religion that has spread around the world, and makes you sit up and take notice of this fact if you haven't already.The film took 6 years to prepare, and a year to film, and the effort shows in its quality.This is a film sadly long forgotten, but that should be seen now by anyone who wants to get a little knowledge of Islam unaffected by their own, or any Media's, prejudices.You will come away from this educational film with an understanding you may not have had before, and may be inclined to look for more information so as to be better informed about the Conflict with Radical Islam that the West has found itself in since at least a year after the release of this film.",4,"Well, made Religious Film in the classic Hollywood Mold",1165622400,"12 9,

444381,A2NJO6YE954DBH,6305020086,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[11, 13]","The reaction of Muslims to cartoons of the prophet Muhammad in a Danish newspaper were hardly surprising since I recalled how when ""The Message"" was released in 1976 the publicity that talk about how Muhammad was not depicting on screen in the film.  What I learned in finally watching the film is that this also meant that the voice of the prophet could not be heard as well, and that his immediate family (wives, daughters, sons-in-law) are also covered by this prohibition.  This means there are moments in the film where actors address the camera directly, which represents Muhammad's point of view and pause as they listen to dialogue that is not being spoken.  Anthony Quinn plays Hamza, an uncle of Muhammad, and becomes one of several key figures, including Bilal ibn Ribah (Johnny Sekka), who explain and accept Muhammad's teachings.The key thing about this film is that the title tells you what it is really about, which is to say ""The Message"" rather than the messenger.  There are biographical elements of Muhammad's life presented, usually as exposition by other characters when talking about the prophet, but what matters more are the beliefs espoused by the faithful.  This is not to say that there are not fascinating historical details, such as how it was decided that the faithful would be called to prayer by a human voice rather than a horn or drum, and the story of Muhammad being saved from death by a web spun by a spider, because clearly there are some key events depicted in the film.  But mostly it is the declarations of faith that will stand out in the minds of the audience.  The fact that there will be relatively few viewers who will not learn something about Islam from watching this film that speaks to exactly why it should be seen.The University of Al-Azhar in Cairo and the High Islamic Congress of the Shiat in Lebanon endorsed the accuracy of the film, and while it was banned in many Middle Eastern countries, it was because objections were raised to the making of a commercial film about Muhammad, and not because of doctrinal concerns.  The film is directed by Moustapha Akkad, who made an Arabic version, ""al-Ris?lah,"" with different actors on the same sets on which he filmed ""The Message.""  He only other film as a director was 1981's ""Lion of the Desert,"" which reunited him with Anthony Quinn, but I suspect most people will remember his name as being the executive producer of the ""Halloween"" films.  However, Akkad deserves more credit as a producer for getting the film made than he does for what he brings to it behind the camera as the director.The educational value of this film far outweighs it cinematic merits.  At 177 minutes it runs a bit long because of the number of battle sequences in which the audience has no real appreciation for what is going on.  What matters are the victories and how they advanced the cause of Islam, and not the tactics on those battlefields.  Besides, during these battles there are long stretches without dialogue and troops matching around in the desert, which do feature Maurice Jarre's Oscar nominated score.  The best parts of this film are when these figures from history are talking about the beliefs and tenets of Islam, and the worst are the melodramatic parts, which usually involve Irene Pappas as Hind, whose emotionalism runs against the tenor of the rest of the cast, exemplified by not only Quinn but Michael Ansara as Abu Sofyan, the leading merchant of Mecca.  Keeping clear who these characters are might be difficult, but understanding what they believe will be easier and much more important.I would be shocked if there was another movie made devoted to either the life of Muhammad or the rise of Islam, so ""The Message"" is going to be the only dramatization of those subjects available to teachers to show their students.  If I could cut a third of this film its educational value could be doubled, but even with its flaws this film is going to teach them more about Islam that any textbook chapter or documentary of talking heads and ancient artwork.  As for ""The Message"" constituting an effort at conversion, I do not see that to be the case.  What I expect is that students, seeing a choice between the three hundred and sixty tribal gods kept in the Kaaba by the merchants of Mecca who set themselves up as the overlords of Arabia, and the monotheism declared by Muhammad that also established the equality of slave and master in the eye of God, will agree with the faithful in this film as to which path to choose.  There should be some fascinating classroom discussions after watching this film, and being reissued this year on DVD as a 30th-anniversary edition should increase the chances of that happening.",4,A dramatization of the rise of Islam well worth watching,1145491200,"04 20, 2006",2006,4723,"['reaction', 'Muslims', 'cartoons', 'prophet', 'Muhammad', 'Danish', 'newspaper', 'were', 'hardly', 'surprising', 'recalled', 'how', 'when', 'Message', 'was', 'released', '1976', 'publicity', 'talk', 'how', 'Muhammad', 'was', 'not', 'depicting', 'screen', 'film', 'What', 'learned', 'finally', 'watching', 'film', 'also', 'voice', 'prophet', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'heard', 'well', 'immediate', 'family', 'wives', 'daughters', 'sons-in-law', 'are', 'also', 'covered', 'prohibition', 'are', 'moments', 'film', 'where', 'actors', 'address', 'camera', 'directly', 'Muhammad', 'point', 'view', 'pause', 'listen', 'dialogue', 'not', 'being', 'spoken', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'Hamza', 'uncle', 'Muhammad', 'one', 'several', 'key', 'figures', 'including', 'Bilal', 'ibn', 'Ribah', 'Johnny', 'Sekka', 'who', 'explain', 'accept', 'Muhammad', 'teachings.The', 'key', 'thing', 'film', 'title', 'what', 'really', 'say', 'Message', 'rather', 'messenger', 'are', 'biographical', 'elements', 'Muhammad', 'life', 'presented', 'usually', 'exposition', 'other', 'characters', 'when', 'talking', 'prophet', 'what', 'more', 'are', 'beliefs', 'espoused', 'faithful', 'not', 'say', 'are', 'not', 'fascinating', 'historical', 'details', 'such', 'how', 'was', 'decided', 'faithful', 'would', 'be', 'called', 'prayer', 'human', 'voice', 'rather', 'horn', 'drum', 'story', 'Muhammad', 'being', 'saved', 'death', 'web', 'spun', 'spider', 'clearly', 'are', 'key', 'events', 'depicted', 'film', 'mostly', 'declarations', 'faith', 'will', 'stand', 'out', 'minds', 'audience', 'fact', 'will', 'be', 'relatively', 'few', 'viewers', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'learn', 'something', 'Islam', 'watching', 'film', 'exactly', 'why', 'should', 'be', 'seen.The', 'University', 'Al-Azhar', 'Cairo', 'High', 'Islamic', 'Congress', 'Shiat', 'Lebanon', 'endorsed', 'accuracy', 'film', 'was', 'banned', 'many', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'countries', 'was', 'objections', 'were', 'raised', 'making', 'commercial', 'film', 'Muhammad', 'not', 'doctrinal', 'concerns', 'film', 'directed', 'Moustapha', 'Akkad', 'who', 'made', 'Arabic', 'version', 'al-Ris', 'lah', 'different', 'actors', 'same', 'sets', 'filmed', 'Message', 'only', 'other', 'film', 'director', 'was', '1981', 'Lion', 'Desert', 'reunited', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'suspect', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'remember', 'name', 'being', 'executive', 'producer', 'Halloween', 'films', 'However', 'Akkad', 'more', 'credit', 'producer', 'getting', 'film', 'made', 'what', 'camera', 'director.The', 'educational', 'value', 'film', 'far', 'cinematic', 'merits', '177', 'minutes', 'bit', 'long', 'number', 'battle', 'sequences', 'audience', 'real', 'appreciation', 'what', 'going', 'What', 'matters', 'are', 'victories', 'how', 'advanced', 'cause', 'Islam', 'not', 'tactics', 'battlefields', 'Besides', 'battles', 'are', 'long', 'stretches', 'dialogue', 'troops', 'matching', 'around', 'desert', 'do', 'feature', 'Maurice', 'Jarre', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'score', 'best', 'parts', 'film', 'are', 'when', 'figures', 'history', 'are', 'talking', 'beliefs', 'tenets', 'Islam', 'worst', 'are', 'melodramatic', 'parts', 'usually', 'involve', 'Irene', 'Pappas', 'Hind', 'emotionalism', 'tenor', 'rest', 'cast', 'exemplified', 'not', 'only', 'Quinn', 'Michael', 'Ansara', 'Abu', 'Sofyan', 'leading', 'merchant', 'Mecca', 'Keeping', 'clear', 'who', 'characters', 'are', 'might', 'be', 'difficult', 'understanding', 'what', 'believe', 'will', 'be', 'easier', 'much', 'more', 'important.I', 'would', 'be', 'shocked', 'was', 'movie', 'made', 'devoted', 'either', 'life', 'Muhammad', 'rise', 'Islam', 'Message', 'going', 'be', 'only', 'dramatization', 'subjects', 'available', 'teachers', 'show', 'students', 'could', 'cut', 'third', 'film', 'educational', 'value', 'could', 'be', 'doubled', 'even', 'flaws', 'film', 'going', 'teach', 'more', 'Islam', 'textbook', 'chapter', 'documentary', 'talking', 'heads', 'ancient', 'artwork', 'Message', 'constituting', 'effort', 'conversion', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'be', 'case', 'What', 'expect', 'students', 'seeing', 'choice', 'three', 'hundred', 'sixty', 'tribal', 'gods', 'kept', 'Kaaba', 'merchants', 'Mecca', 'who', 'set', 'up', 'overlords', 'Arabia', 'monotheism', 'declared', 'Muhammad', 'also', 'established', 'equality', 'slave', 'master', 'eye', 'God', 'will', 'agree', 'faithful', 'film', 'path', 'choose', 'should', 'be', 'fascinating', 'classroom', 'discussions', 'watching', 'film', 'being', 'reissued', 'year', 'DVD', '30th-anniversary', 'edition', 'should', 'increase', 'chances', 'happening']",The Message VHS

444388,A207IYGZTAF0DS,6305020086,NoWireHangers,"[2, 4]","A few years before producing the slasher movieHalloween, Moustapha Akkad undertook the challenge to make a movie about Muhammad, the founder/prophet of Islam. Since the religion forbids depictions of its prophet, Muhammad is never shown on screen, nor is his voice heard. The main characters here are Muhammad's adopted son Zaid (Damien Thomas), his uncle Hamza (Anthony Quinn) and a slave named Bilal (Johnny Sekka). Convinced by Muhammad's teachings, they try to revolt against the ruling merchants of Mecca. These merchants don't like the idea of monotheism because it would hurt the economy and they also don't like the idea of slaves and women being equal to men. So Muhammad and his followers are exiled, but the battle is not yet over...Much of the time, the movie works surprisingly well despite Muhammad's absence, but at times it's rather awkward, even silly. Occasionally, the camera takes his place, having people talk to the camera, apparently getting replies that we, the audience, can't hear. Muhammad does no preaching, instead one of his followes will have to tell the crowd, and the viewers, ""The prophet has said..."". This fails to give the impression of Muhammad as a strong leader, because he doesn't really do anything at all. We also don't get to know him, nor do we get to see his revelations, the way we got to see Moses get the stone tablets on Mount Sinai inThe Ten Commandments. The movie may be less offensive to muslims this way, but it's also less effective and convincing for the rest of us. It's also quite difficult for the non-believing viewer to really identify with the religious motivations of the characters.According to an opening note before the film, it's historicity has been approved by certain Islamic leaders and scholars. Whether it's been approved by other - more neutral - historians, I don't know; the movie ignores the more controversial aspects of Muhammad's life and teachings.In conclusion, though, while ""The Message"" clearly is a pro-Muslim film that gives us only the good side of the religion, suffers somewhat from lack of a protagonist and is a bit longer than it needed to be, it's still an interesting movie and a good introduction to the early history of Islam, as portrayed by its followers.

Orphaned at six and trained to be a merchant, Mohammad received the prophetic call in a series of visions that later were recorded as the Koran.The movie never actually shows an image of Mohammad.  A respectful religious conceit that works. Sometimes the camera assumes his point of view or cuts to his companions. Anthony Quinn stands out as warrior Uncle Hamza.The film begins in 610 A.D. at Ka'bah where pagans worship over 300 idols and merchants rule the sacred community.  For three days, Mohammad has been secluded in the mountains receiving visions from Allah via the angel Gabriel. A small group of believers meet secretly before openly proclaiming His monotheistic message of mercy and love to the locals.But these rebels are attacked and the survivors flee.The film straightforwardly presents the traditional events in the history of Islam.  It also makes clear Mohammad's true message of mercy and peace, a far cry from the interpretation of extremists attempting to ignite a jihad.  There are over 1.5 billion practicing Moslems in the world and it is currently the fastest growing religion.  Attention must be paid.

At its inception Islam was enlightend and forgiving.  What happaned to that outlook?  Over time the ideas of Mohammad became entrenched and corrupted, much as with Christianity.The Middle East never expereinced anything like the Scientific Revolution of the West which inspired the Reniassance.  Free, independent thought are not conducive to state operated theocratic governments.  This is what Islam is.  The religion is both government and state.  There is no seperation between the two.  History has shown that religious regimes tend to be conservetive in their development.Islam was great in the 6th - 10th centuries.  In the 21st century with its failure to evolve, and with its innate fear of change, it is a dead weight around the neck of nearly every Middle Eastern country.This film is a great achievement, and although a homage to early Islam one can see why the religion had such appeal to those dusty Arabs of the dessert.  The battle scenes are first-rate and show how intense and intimate these small skirmishes were in early Islam.  Anyone interested in Middle Ages warfare should find these scenes worthwhile.  I would say its one of the highlights of the entire film which can be a bit slow at times.The extra feature showing the behind scenes efforts is quite extensive and illustates how carefully the director wanted to film this project.  The fact that he had two movies - one in English, the other in Arabic, is quite unique.Perhaps followers today can learn something from watching this older film and perhaps attempt to regain something of the enlightenment that seems lacking in their faith today.",4,Classy Islamic Propaganda,1243382400,"05 27, 2009",2009,1764,"['too', 'bad', 'noble', 'sentiments', 'expressed', 'homage', 'early', 'Islam', 'are', 'not', 'practised', 'universally', 'more', 'radical', 'followers', 'today', 'inception', 'Islam', 'was', 'enlightend', 'forgiving', 'What', 'happaned', 'outlook', 'time', 'ideas', 'Mohammad', 'became', 'entrenched', 'corrupted', 'much', 'Christianity.The', 'Middle', 'East', 'never', 'expereinced', 'anything', 'Scientific', 'Revolution', 'West', 'inspired', 'Reniassance', 'Free', 'independent', 'thought', 'are', 'not', 'conducive', 'state', 'operated', 'theocratic', 'governments', 'what', 'Islam', 'religion', 'government', 'state', 'seperation', 'two', 'History', 'shown', 'religious', 'regimes', 'tend', 'be', 'conservetive', 'development.Islam', 'was', 'great', '6th', '10th', 'centuries', '21st', 'century', 'failure', 'evolve', 'innate', 'fear', 'change', 'dead', 'weight', 'neck', 'nearly', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'country.This', 'film', 'great', 'achievement', 'homage', 'early', 'Islam', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'religion', 'had', 'such', 'appeal', 'dusty', 'Arabs', 'dessert', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'first-rate', 'show', 'how', 'intense', 'intimate', 'small', 'skirmishes', 'were', 'early', 'Islam', 'Anyone', 'interested', 'Middle', 'Ages', 'warfare', 'should', 'find', 'scenes', 'worthwhile', 'would', 'say', 'one', 'highlights', 'entire', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'slow', 'times.The', 'extra', 'feature', 'showing', 'behind', 'scenes', 'efforts', 'quite', 'extensive', 'how', 'carefully', 'director', 'wanted', 'film', 'project', 'fact', 'had', 'two', 'movies', 'one', 'English', 'other', 'Arabic', 'quite', 'unique.Perhaps', 'followers', 'today', 'can', 'learn', 'something', 'watching', 'older', 'film', 'perhaps', 'attempt', 'regain', 'something', 'enlightenment', 'lacking', 'faith', 'today']",The Message VHS

But Islamic law would not allow that to happen as it would be blasphemy to show the image of Muhammad.  However, fellow Muslim Moustapha Akkad found a way to make a film without insulting the masses.  ""The Message"" was an epic film that took 6 years to prepare for and a year to shoot.  Led by Oscar winner Anthony Quinn, the film is very faithful and accurate in its historical value.  However, there are some shortcomings.  One problem is the film's length.  Three hours is way, way too long.  The film could have been chopped off by about an hour and it still would have been able have an effective story to tell.  Another problem is the dialogue. In the film, ""The Message"", Muhammad is referred, but is not seen.  That makes it a little confusing when the characters are referring to Muhammad.  Despite the shortcomings, ""The Message"" gets its point across without insulting the Islamic religion.  This is a film that should be recommended to people of all faiths and will answer lots of buring questions regarding this controversial faith.  Ironically, Moustapha Akkad was killed by a terrorist bombing while attending a wedding in Jordan in 2005.  It appears that some members of the Islamic faith have not followed Muhammad's ""Message"" not to kill fellow Muslims. It shows that Islam still has many obstacles to climb in getting Muhammad's ""Message"" to its followers.",3,Mix of Sad Ironies Fill this Film!,1184544000,"07 16, 2007",2007,1444,"['Hollywood', 'always', 'wanted', 'have', 'big', 'named', 'star', 'play', 'Muhammad', 'Islamic', 'law', 'would', 'not', 'allow', 'happen', 'would', 'be', 'blasphemy', 'show', 'image', 'Muhammad', 'However', 'fellow', 'Muslim', 'Moustapha', 'Akkad', 'found', 'way', 'make', 'film', 'insulting', 'masses', 'Message', 'was', 'epic', 'film', 'took', '6', 'years', 'prepare', 'year', 'shoot', 'Led', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'film', 'very', 'faithful', 'accurate', 'historical', 'value', 'However', 'are', 'shortcomings', 'One', 'problem', 'film', 'length', 'Three', 'hours', 'way', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'chopped', 'off', 'hour', 'still', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'have', 'effective', 'story', 'tell', 'problem', 'dialogue', 'film', 'Message', 'Muhammad', 'referred', 'not', 'seen', 'little', 'confusing', 'when', 'characters', 'are', 'referring', 'Muhammad', 'shortcomings', 'Message', 'point', 'insulting', 'Islamic', 'religion', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'recommended', 'people', 'faiths', 'will', 'answer', 'lots', 'buring', 'questions', 'regarding', 'controversial', 'faith', 'Ironically', 'Moustapha', 'Akkad', 'was', 'killed', 'terrorist', 'bombing', 'attending', 'wedding', 'Jordan', '2005', 'members', 'Islamic', 'faith', 'have', 'not', 'followed', 'Muhammad', 'Message', 'not', 'kill', 'fellow', 'Muslims', 'Islam', 'still', 'many', 'obstacles', 'climb', 'getting', 'Muhammad', 'Message', 'followers']",The Message VHS

The film is based on the story of Islam and the prophethood of Muhammed, peace and blessings be upon him. Islam in Arabic means 'submission to God', a Muslim is one who accepts Islam and therefore is a 'submitter to God' All prophets before Muhammed had been sent down with the same message of truth; to submit to God and worship Him alone. The Message reveals this as much as it reflects the true prophethood of Muhammed and the revelation of the Quran being the last revelation that God sent down to mankind.The film is well acted. Anthony Quinn plays the role of Hamza Bin Abdul Mutalib, the prophet's uncle, who was one of the first people to accept the message that his nephew had been sent with, one of the greatest warriors and early martyrs in Islam. The film is also beautifully shot in the deserts of North Africa.I recommend this film to all Muslims and non-Muslims. For the Muslims, this film will be an engaging and very emotional experience. For the non-Muslims, it will be a good lesson in knowing and understanding the truth and essence of Islam and how its message is universal and true.Muhammed, peace be upon him, is not portayed on screen because it is forbidden to resemble any prophet by another person even for artistic reasons.

This was my third time watching this movie and again I come away with new ideas as well as a greater respect for Muslims and their faith.  When the Christian Abbysinnian King draws a line in the ground to show how thin the differences between Christianity and Islam are, you get a sense that you're watching a movie that can change peoples perceptions about other religions.I thought not having an actor portray Mohommad (PBUH) was a signature theme of the respect this movie shows for Allah and his messenger.  While Anthony Quinn seemed to thrive in his role as the Lion Hunter, his dialogue with the camera as Mohommad was brilliant. The supporting cast, though a bit stiff (1977), takes nothing away from the overall performance.  There is no misunderstanding the messenger's message. He continues to remind followers that he is just a man. An illiterate man who received the word of God with a duty to reveal it to man.Regardless of your ethnicity or religious beliefs, this movie is a joy to watch simply because it teaches while telling a very revelatory tale about the man who brought the message of Islam to Arabia and the struggle to have it take root in the culture.
