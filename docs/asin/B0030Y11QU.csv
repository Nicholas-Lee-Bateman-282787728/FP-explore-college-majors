I wasn't sure, but I went into it with high hopes, especially once I saw Ron Perlman was in it.  I definitely didn't get what I was expecting.  The low budget didn't kill it, in fact it sort of made it cool in a way (the backdrops and sets are quite interesting), the acting is what did it in.  That and the story.  The undead seemed absurd beyond what I'm willing to tolerate and the actors made it very aware that they were acting.  As far as the story goes, there really wasn't one.

1315965,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,B0030Y11QU,Carl Manes,"[3, 3]","A pair of grave robbers strike gold when they discover a wealth of undead corpses (including zombies, vampires, and other ghouls) buried in the local cemetery, bodies that earn them a fine reward from the seedy local doctors working under the guise of science. Their framed story is retold by Arthur Blake, the younger of the two thieves, who relays their adventures to a priest while awaiting the guillotine. Glenn McQuaid similarly strikes gold with this off-beat but highly original Horror Comedy, offering the same stunning cinematography and art design as the Hammer productions with a classic Gothic aesthetic. Fessenden and Monaghan make for a charmingly clever pair of down on their luck grave robbers, and they are joined by an equally talented and enjoyable cast of miscreants including the great Ron Perlman as the wayward priest. The production and design of the film could not have been improved, but I SELL THE DEAD falls just short of becoming a modern classic due to the uneven pacing brought on by its structure and format. As Blake begins each new tale, a great amount of time is spent setting up each new scenario and introducing new characters, which inevitably undermines the action, suspense, and horror. The fleshed out characters and plot are both appreciated, but not at the cost of a rushed payoff for each of the vignettes. McQuaid displays a tremendous amount of potential in this, his second film, and hopefully the open ending will allow for an even stronger sequel with the same sharp scripting and humor.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",4,I Sell The Dead,1270944000,"04 11, 2010",2010,1567,"['pair', 'grave', 'robbers', 'strike', 'gold', 'when', 'discover', 'wealth', 'undead', 'corpses', 'including', 'zombies', 'vampires', 'other', 'ghouls', 'buried', 'local', 'cemetery', 'bodies', 'earn', 'fine', 'reward', 'seedy', 'local', 'doctors', 'working', 'guise', 'science', 'framed', 'story', 'retold', 'Arthur', 'Blake', 'younger', 'two', 'thieves', 'who', 'relays', 'adventures', 'priest', 'awaiting', 'guillotine', 'Glenn', 'McQuaid', 'similarly', 'strikes', 'gold', 'off-beat', 'highly', 'original', 'Horror', 'Comedy', 'offering', 'same', 'stunning', 'cinematography', 'art', 'design', 'Hammer', 'productions', 'classic', 'Gothic', 'aesthetic', 'Fessenden', 'Monaghan', 'make', 'charmingly', 'clever', 'pair', 'down', 'luck', 'grave', 'robbers', 'are', 'joined', 'equally', 'talented', 'enjoyable', 'cast', 'miscreants', 'including', 'great', 'Ron', 'Perlman', 'wayward', 'priest', 'production', 'design', 'film', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'improved', 'SELL', 'DEAD', 'just', 'short', 'becoming', 'modern', 'classic', 'due', 'uneven', 'pacing', 'brought', 'structure', 'format', 'Blake', 'new', 'tale', 'great', 'amount', 'time', 'spent', 'setting', 'up', 'new', 'scenario', 'introducing', 'new', 'characters', 'inevitably', 'action', 'suspense', 'horror', 'fleshed', 'characters', 'plot', 'are', 'appreciated', 'not', 'cost', 'rushed', 'payoff', 'vignettes', 'McQuaid', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'potential', 'second', 'film', 'hopefully', 'open', 'ending', 'will', 'allow', 'even', 'stronger', 'sequel', 'same', 'sharp', 'scripting', 'humor.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",N/A

It can be rented at Blockbuster as one of their exclusives and is scheduled for a street release at the end of March. It is a low budget project, but one that's produced with a lot of class, wit, energy and a respect for the genre.It involves a couple of low-life, but likable Burke and Hare-type grave robbers named Grimes and Blake, and their misadventures supplying fresh corpses for a local doctor/mortician (Angus Scrimm). They unearth the usual rotten and not-so-rotten corpses, vampires, zombies and even an extraterrestrial (!), but their most dangerous adventure comes in the form of a sick, violent family of grave robbers who don't appreciate the competition: The House of Murphy. The daughter, who was burned beyond recognition, wears a mask identical to the burned daughter in the classic French film ""Les Yeux sans Visage"" (""Eyes Without a Face"")-great touch! The son grinds up his victims' bones and uses the bone dust for snuff.Overall, a fun, tongue-in-cheek movie with laughs and thrills that belies its low budget with a great script, excellent actors and above-average production values.

1315969,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B0030Y11QU,Eric Sanberg,"[1, 3]","This isn't a movie so to speak. There is neither a story arc nor a character arc. It's really a series of episodes.Here's the scoop. Willie Grimes has been given a close shave under a guillotine for murder and grave robbing. Now it's his partner, Arthur Blake's turn. However, before he's put to death, a priest wants his story. A bottle of whiskey loosens his tongue and he proceeds to tell the priest of his start in the business of robbing graves and many of his adventures up to the big one that landed him in jail.Seems to me the director, Glenn Quaid, had his sights set on making a Sam Raimi-esque type flick and just couldn't pull it off. It has some of the visual appeal of Raimi but not his unique sensibilities. And having a series of vignettes as opposed to a true storyline didn't help. The characters were decent enough but nothing happens to them. They don't change. And when they introduce the Fanny Bryers Character in the third act, to goad Arthur into pulling off the big score, it all seemed too manufactured. Too many other aspects of the movie seemed off as well. Most of the shots weren't framed particularly well. The costumes seemed out of time. This is set in the 19th century but there are shirts with sewn on collars and, I believe, pants with zippers. The styles just seemed wrong. The acting was decent enough.

Well then, you might just like I Sell the Dead!The film takes place (presumably) sometime in the early 1800's in England. Arthur Blake (Dominic Monaghan of Lord of the Rings fame) awaits the gallows for the crime of grave robbing. But before he goes to meet his maker he'll confess to an inquisitive priest stories of he and fellow partner Willie Grimes (Larry Fessenden) exploits with the dead and undead alike. The story is a light-hearted, witty dark comedy that fans of horror movies will get a chuckle out of. It moves at a brisk pace but doesn't feel rushed.The acting is simply terrific. Both Dominic Monaghan and Larry Fessenden are perfect in their roles and play off each other well. The rest of the cast is also great bringing this colorfully dark world of grave robbing to life.In the end, I Sell the Dead isn't going to change the way you think about life and it's probably not going to be one of your favorite horror or comedy movies.

It seems Blake (Dominic Monaghan) and his partner Willie Grimes (Larry Fesseden) were grave robbers--but that's not the crime for which they are bring punished. They were convicted of murder. Blake insists that someone has framed them by leaving a very obvious trail of severed body parts leading right to their respective doorsteps, a point that became mute for Willie since he was the man executed at the film's beginning. The story unfolds in flashbacks as Blake tells Duffy how as a young boy he first became involved with Grimes and of their demanding arrangement with Dr. Quint (Angus Scrimm) who presses them for more and more corpses, pays them nothing, and threatens them with discovery if they don't comply.  One night they find themselves digging up a most unusual corpse that's been buried far from town and outside the graveyard.  That one corpse not only solves their problem with Dr. Quint it opens up a whole new world for them,  and for the viewer. This is where things start to get wonderfully strange!But the tales the cleric is most interested in however are those related to a rival gang of grave robbers called the House of Murphy, a ruthless bunch led by Cornelius Murphy. To illustrate how nasty Cornelius is Blake tells a story in flashback about how Cornelius's mother gave him a mechanical toy--a wind-up bird in a cage that fluttered it's wings and sang. The boy loved it  and sat on the floor watching it for hours. His father stomped on it with his boot. His mother gave him a little chick which the boy loved dearly and played with on the floor and his father stomped on it with his boot. His mother gave him a white bunny-- well, let's just say that Cornelius was a couple of steps ahead of Dad on this one.There's a lot more to the story of course, and that's the part you're going to have to see for yourselves because I'm not going to tell you. Some say that the plot was never going anywhere but I don't think that's true at all. It just went there somewhat circuitously.  Audiences are lazy and are accustomed to having everything laid out for them in a nice neat pattern; beginning, middle, end. We seem to demand an obvious conflict at the beginning followed by an obvious resolution at the end. What I think writer/director Glenn McQuaid has down is given us a clever, witty, inventive story that in it's own totally impossible way is a little more like real life--it wanders around and then suddenly the protagonist finds out there's been a conflict. Surprise. (Actually we ARE tipped off about it the coming conflict in advance when Blake insists he and Grimes were framed, because they were. In other words, the film IS going somewhere it's just doing it in a rather subtle manner.)  But no matter what you think of the plotline I can almost guarantee that you are going to have some fun with this film provided you enjoy the British sense of humor and don't suffer from ADD because it does have somewhat of a leisurely pace about it for the first act. The acting (aside from Perlman's accent) is excellent, with Monaghan turning in an especially good performance as Blake. The writing and direction are top notch and the cinematography won a well deserved award at SLAMDANCE. Surprisingly there's very little in the way of violence of actual bloodshed but there's a ton of entertainment value for anyone who's looking for something they haven't seen a thousand times before.HYPE VALUE: non-existent, deserves an audience",4,Like Burke and Hare--But With a Twist,1270684800,"04 8, 2010",2010,4819,"['have', 'admit', 'lately', ""'ve"", 'been', 'plagued', 'feelings',

1315980,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B0030Y11QU,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[0, 0]","I Sell the Dead is a low budget comedy horror about grave robber Arthur Blake (Dominic Monaghan) recounting his exploits to Father Duffy (Ron Perlman) hours before his execution.Monaghan established himself as the clever trickster Merry from Lord of the Rings and his role as a grave robber in training isn't much of a stretch. The fun is in the retelling of course, and in that respect I Sell the Dead doesn't disappoint.The film begins with the decapitation of Willie Grimes (Larry Fessenden), who once showed Blake the ropes.  Their early career was a simple life: digging up corpses, robbing the bodies, and then fleeing with the goods.  But then they met Doctor Quint (Angus Scrimm), a villainous doctor more interested in fresh cadavers for his unholy experiments.As the grave robbers were forced to take increasingly desperate measures to procure corpses, they stumbled across a not-quite-dead corpse. Discovering its weakness, they delivered a corpse much fresher than Quint expected...and suddenly found themselves without an employer.  With a reputation for dealing with the supernatural, the two grave robbers clashed with the House of Murphy.  Blake's girlfriend Fanny Bryers (Brenda Cooney) goaded him into direct competition with a job claimed by the House of Murphy.  Macabre hijinks ensued.I Sell the Dead takes its cues from popular cult horror films like Evil Dead and Night of the Living Dead, sprinkled with a good deal of Irish humor and comic book style sensibilities from director Glenn McQuaid. The three flashback stories click along competently, with a final twist in the last act. There's just one problem: I guessed every single plot detail.I SPOIL THE DEAD: Now maybe this is just me.  I've seen a lot of horror movies.  On the other hand, the movie is aimed at cult fans that probably have seen more films than I have.  I guessed what was buried in the crossroads, how they would get rid of Dr. Quint, what the mysterious corpse really was in the second flashback, who would bite who in the third flashback, the real story behind the story in the final act, and the surprise return of a character nobody expected...except me.By just reading the above sentence, cult fans can probably decode the entire film without breaking a sweat.

1315985,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B0030Y11QU,RMurray847,"[0, 1]","One needs to have the proper expectations to enjoy I SELL THE DEAD.  This is not really a horror story.  It's not scary, nor is it really meant to be.  It's an homage to both the horror comics of prior generations, as well as a nod to great horrors movies of the past.  It is a silly, light comedy...the laughs are modest, but the tone is jovial.The movie begins with the execution of one long-time grave robber, and the subsequent interrogation of his younger partner by a priest eager to hear the secrets these grave robbers might have to share.  (The movie is set in some vague 17th - 19th century time, I would guess.) Thus, we are shown a series of little stories, as the grave robber first tells us how he joined the business, then how he mastered it, and at last, how he and his partner began to discover unusual things during their work (such as vampires, zombies and a few other surprises).  Each of these little ""short stories"" is loosely tied together, and thus the movie feels a little bit like a linear story mixed with a horror anthology.The movie was filmed on a very low budget and the special effects really hearken to a much earlier era.  Fog machines were put to HEAVY use here, primarily to cover the cheesy sets and CGI backgrounds.  The film is made with gusto and the right amount of over-acting.  There is nothing subtle here.  In fact, much of the editing and camera work reminded me of early Sam Raimi, with charging cameras and similar lighting.  Character development is minimal and motivations are always sketchy at best.  No attempt is made to explain why there are vampires, for example...they just are.The star of the film is Dominic Monaghan (""Lost"") as the younger grave robber.  He works primarily alongside Larry Fessenden as his mentor.  The two have a fairly easy chemistry, but a lot of their dialogue is repetitive and there are numerous scenes of the two of them at the local pub, discussing plans or upbraiding each other for wrongs.  These scenes feel like padding in an already short (83 minutes) film.  Ron Perlman (""Sons of Anarchy"") is the inquisitive priest, and Angus Scrimm from PHANTASM makes a brief appearance.  Otherwise, the cast is unremarkable and fairly amateurish.This movie has a light-hearted, easy-going quality that is quite amiable.  Everyone is having a good time.  There are a few splashes of real humor, such as in the depiction of the zombies.  But the movie is simply TOO easy-going, TOO amateurish and TOO lazily written to be truly enjoyable.  I don't feel I wasted my time, exactly...but I was never deeply involved and even occasionally was checking my watch to see how much was left.  I have no problem with low-budget production values (which the filmmakers did a good job of maximizing), and I can even tolerate mediocre supporting acting...but there is no excuse for lazy writing.  A bit more attention to the work done BEFORE the cameras were even turned on might have turned this from ""barely passable on a slow night"" to ""good, clean, harmless fun.""",3,Set expectations to a properly humble level and you MIGHT enjoy it,1349136000,"10 2, 2012",2012,3029,"['One', 'have', 'proper', 'expectations', 'enjoy', 'SELL', 'DEAD', 'not', 'really', 'horror', 'story', 'not', 'scary', 'really', 'meant', 'be', 'homage', 'horror', 'comics', 'prior', 'generations', 'as', 'well', 'nod', 'great', 'horrors', 'movies', 'past', 'silly', 'light', 'comedy', 'laughs', 'are', 'modest', 'tone', 'jovial.The', 'movie', 'execution', 'one', 'long-time', 'grave', 'robber', 'subsequent', 'interrogation', 'younger', 'partner', 'priest', 'eager', 'hear', 'secrets', 'grave', 'robbers', 'might', 'have', 'share', 'movie', 'set', 'vague', '17th', '19th', 'century', 'time', 'would', 'guess', 'Thus', 'are', 'shown', 'series', 'little', 'stories', 'grave', 'robber', 'first', 'how', 'joined', 'business', 'then', 'how', 'mastered', 'last', 'how', 'partner', 'began', 'discover', 'unusual', 'things', 'work', 'such', 'vampires', 'zombies', 'few', 'other', 'surprises', 'little', 'short', 'stories', 'loosely', 'tied', 'together', 'thus', 'movie', 'little', 'bit', 'linear', 'story', 'mixed', 'horror', 'anthology.The', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'very', 'low', 'budget', 'special', 'effects', 'really', 'hearken', 'much', 'earlier', 'era', 'Fog', 'machines', 'were', 'put', 'HEAVY', 'use', 'here', 'primarily', 'cover', 'cheesy', 'sets', 'CGI', 'backgrounds', 'film', 'made', 'gusto', 'right', 'amount', 'over-acting', 'nothing', 'subtle', 'here', 'fact', 'much', 'editing', 'camera', 'work', 'reminded', 'early', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'charging', 'cameras', 'similar', 'lighting', 'Character', 'development', 'minimal', 'motivations', 'are', 'always', 'sketchy', 'best', 'attempt', 'made', 'explain', 'why', 'are', 'vampires', 'example', 'just', 'are.The', 'star', 'film', 'Dominic', 'Monaghan', 'Lost', 'younger', 'grave', 'robber', 'primarily', 'alongside', 'Larry', 'Fessenden', 'mentor', 'two', 'have', 'fairly', 'easy', 'chemistry', 'lot', 'dialogue', 'repetitive', 'are', 'numerous', 'scenes', 'two', 'local', 'pub', 'discussing', 'plans', 'upbraiding', 'other', 'wrongs', 'scenes', 'feel', 'padding', 'already', 'short', '83', 'minutes', 'film', 'Ron', 'Perlman', 'Sons', 'Anarchy', 'inquisitive', 'priest', 'Angus', 'Scrimm', 'PHANTASM', 'brief', 'appearance', 'Otherwise', 'cast', 'unremarkable', 'fairly', 'amateurish.This', 'movie', 'light-hearted', 'easy-going', 'quality', 'quite', 'amiable', 'Everyone', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'are', 'few', 'splashes', 'real', 'humor', 'such', 'depiction', 'zombies', 'movie', 'simply', 'TOO', 'easy-going', 'TOO', 'amateurish', 'TOO', 'lazily', 'written', 'be', 'truly', 'enjoyable', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'wasted', 'time', 'exactly', 'was', 'never', 'deeply', 'involved', 'even', 'occasionally', 'was', 'checking', 'watch', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'was', 'left', 'have', 'problem', 'low-budget', 'production', 'values', 'filmmakers', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'maximizing', 'can', 'even', 'tolerate', 'mediocre', 'supporting', 'acting', 'excuse', 'lazy', 'writing', 'bit', 'more', 'attention', 'work', 'done', 'cameras', 'were', 'even', 'turned', 'might', 'have', 'turned', 'barely', 'passable', 'slow', 'night', 'good', 'clean', 'harmless', 'fun']",N/A

1315989,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B0030Y11QU,Todd Smith,"[0, 0]","In this dark, 18th century comedy, Dominic Monaghan stars as a grave robber and accused murderer, who by his own admission, is not a great guy. The plot of this film is absolutely brilliant and they could have done so much with it, but quickly it turned from the improbably to the ridiculously stupid. In the beginning, Arthur Blake (Monaghan), sits down with a priest to tell his story and give a voice his last words. Blake starts to tell his story about how at a young age, his mother forced him into this line of work. That part of the movie is great, and if they would have continued along those lines, this film would have been amazing, unfortunately, Blake grows up, and that's when things start getting weird. First, they find a zombie, a twist in the story I suspected might be coming. It was pretty lame, but was done in a humorous way, which made it a little easier to swallow. From that point on, the film gets ridiculous, as the pair has run-ins with rival gangs of grave robbers and even aliens. What started out as a very imaginative film turned into a big confusing mess. The story just goes off in so many different directions and gets so far away from the original plot, that it quickly becomes almost unwatchable. Monaghan is terrific and continues to be an extremely underrated actor. We all know him from Lost and Lord of The Rings, but only as an ancillary character, but in I Sell The Dead, Monaghan shows that he is far too good to spend his career as a sidekick. I loved the idea and I really wanted to like this film, but the truth is I didn't. After the first half-hour, there really isn't anything worth watching.",2,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...]- @tss5078,1361491200,"02 22, 2013",2013,1641,"['dark', '18th', 'century', 'comedy', 'Dominic', 'Monaghan', 'grave', 'robber', 'accused', 'murderer', 'who', 'own', 'admission', 'not', 'great', 'guy', 'plot', 'film', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'so', 'much', 'quickly', 'turned', 'improbably', 'ridiculously', 'stupid', 'beginning', 'Arthur', 'Blake', 'Monaghan', 'down', 'priest', 'tell', 'story', 'give', 'voice', 'last', 'words', 'Blake', 'starts', 'tell', 'story', 'how', 'young', 'age', 'mother', 'forced', 'line', 'work', 'part', 'movie', 'great', 'would', 'have', 'continued', 'lines', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'amazing', 'unfortunately', 'Blake', 'up', 'when', 'things', 'start', 'getting', 'weird', 'First', 'find', 'zombie', 'twist', 'story', 'suspected', 'might', 'be', 'coming', 'was', 'pretty', 'lame', 'was', 'done', 'humorous', 'way', 'made', 'little', 'easier', 'swallow', 'point', 'film', 'ridiculous', 'pair', 'run-ins', 'rival', 'gangs', 'grave', 'robbers', 'even', 'aliens', 'What', 'started', 'out', 'very', 'imaginative', 'film', 'turned', 'big', 'confusing', 'mess', 'story', 'just', 'off', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'directions', 'so', 'far', 'away', 'original', 'plot', 'quickly', 'almost', 'unwatchable', 'Monaghan', 'terrific', 'be', 'extremely', 'underrated', 'actor', 'know', 'Lost', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'only', 'ancillary', 'character', 'Sell', 'Dead', 'Monaghan', 'far', 'too', 'good', 'spend', 'career', 'sidekick', 'loved', 'idea', 'really', 'wanted', 'like', 'film', 'truth', 'did', ""n't"", 'first', 'half-hour', 'really', ""n't"", 'anything', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

1315991,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B0030Y11QU,Z Hayes,"[0, 0]","One of my favorite classic horror movies isThe Flesh and the Fiendsstarring horror icon Peter Cushing and featuring two grave robbers, Hare and Burke, who resort to less conventional (and criminal) methods to keep the good doctor supplied in fresh corpses. ""I Sell the Dead"" also features grave robbers, and is more of a homage to old horror classics.The movie focuses on Arthur Blake (Dominic Monaghan) who has been sentenced to death for murder and whilst awaiting his execution, narrates his ghoulish experiences to a priest (played by Ron Perlman). The viewer is then taken via flashback to the past where Arthur and his boss/mentor Willie (Larry Fessenden) are in the business of grave robbing, digging up corpses to sell for a tidy profit. But, these are no ordinary corpses as Arthur confesses to the priest - there are vampires, zombies, and all manner of the undead. The scenes of the pair digging up the corpses and being attacked by the undead are truly fun to watch - one scene features Arthur pooh-poohing the stake in a female corpse's heart and nonchalantly pulling it out, whilst Willie cautions him repeatedly not to do it. Of course, the vampire attacks the pair and Willie who catches on to the whole stake-in-heart=dormant vampire (though many movies have it that this is the way to kill vampires) starts playing with the undead corpse - pulling out the stake and piercing it back again and again! There are other scenes that convey similar comic effects which I personally found entertaining and refreshing.The story does not flow all that well - partly because the scenes in the past are rather awkwardly weaved together with the ones in the present (with the priest), but fans of classic horror might find something to appreciate in this indie flick especially in its unabashed attempt to pay homage to the old horror classics.",4,In the tradition of Hare and Burke - entertaining horror-comedy,1273190400,"05 7, 2010",2010,1850,"['One', 'favorite', 'classic', 'horror', 'movies', 'isThe', 'Flesh', 'Fiendsstarring', 'horror', 'icon', 'Peter', 'Cushing', 'featuring', 'two', 'grave', 'robbers', 'Hare', 'Burke', 'who', 'resort', 'less', 'conventional', 'criminal', 'methods', 'keep', 'good', 'doctor', 'supplied', 'fresh', 'corpses', 'Sell', 'Dead', 'also', 'grave', 'robbers', 'more', 'homage', 'old', 'horror', 'classics.The', 'movie', 'Arthur', 'Blake', 'Dominic', 'Monaghan', 'who', 'been', 'sentenced', 'death', 'murder', 'whilst', 'awaiting', 'execution', 'ghoulish', 'experiences', 'priest', 'played', 'Ron', 'Perlman', 'viewer', 'then', 'taken', 'flashback', 'past', 'where', 'Arthur', 'boss/mentor', 'Willie', 'Larry', 'Fessenden', 'are', 'business', 'grave', 'robbing', 'digging', 'up', 'corpses', 'sell', 'tidy', 'profit', 'are', 'ordinary', 'corpses', 'Arthur', 'priest', 'are', 'vampires', 'zombies', 'manner', 'undead', 'scenes', 'pair', 'digging', 'up', 'corpses', 'being', 'attacked', 'undead', 'are', 'truly', 'fun', 'watch', 'one', 'scene', 'Arthur', 'pooh-poohing', 'stake', 'female', 'corpse', 'heart', 'nonchalantly', 'pulling', 'out', 'whilst', 'Willie', 'cautions', 'repeatedly', 'not', 'do', 'course', 'vampire', 'pair', 'Willie', 'who', 'whole', 'stake-in-heart=dormant', 'vampire', 'many', 'movies', 'have', 'way', 'kill', 'vampires', 'playing', 'undead', 'corpse', 'pulling', 'out', 'stake', 'piercing', 'back', 'again', 'again', 'are', 'other', 'scenes', 'convey', 'similar', 'comic', 'effects', 'personally', 'found', 'entertaining', 'refreshing.The', 'story', 'not', 'flow', 'well', 'partly', 'scenes', 'past', 'are', 'rather', 'awkwardly', 'weaved', 'together', 'ones', 'present', 'priest', 'fans', 'classic', 'horror', 'might', 'find', 'something', 'appreciate', 'indie', 'flick', 'especially', 'unabashed', 'attempt', 'pay', 'homage', 'old', 'horror', 'classics']",N/A
