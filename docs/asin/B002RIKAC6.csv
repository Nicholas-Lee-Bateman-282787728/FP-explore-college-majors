1285822,AHIK7BUXFRMT8,B002RIKAC6,David Bower,"[7, 7]","My wife and I watched the movie last night and I was fascinated by the story line. Whereas I see some of the reviewers were annoyed by the story I thought it was a rather intriguing combination of what is going on right now, visions and dreams, with what will actually happen once at some point in the future, the Rapture of the Church.I have read a great deal about the visions and dreams that are taking place right now around the world and especially in the Middle East that are drawing unbelievers to the Lord Jesus Christ. It appears they vary considerably from person to person. This movie follows a series of dreams that are extremely vivid and profoundly disturbing to one man which take place during a mini vacation and change the man's life forever.To say this couldn't or wouldn't happen is to pretend to know what God would or would not do and no one can make that statement factually with regard to saving visions and dreams; with God all things are possible.The movie was exciting and held my attention all the way through. I did successfully guess how it would end but that didn't compromise the drama of the movie and I'll admit the ending brought tears to my eyes. I'm a born again Christian who loves the Lord Jesus Christ as my Savior and God and eagerly awaits His return at the Rapture.

He takes his wife and his partner + his wife go along as well.This is like a spiritual version of ""Groundhog Day"", with the man's day repeating. It's suggested that it's a weird dream, but to him he's waking up at the start of the same day. Of course, nobody but God knows when the rapture will take place. So, when he finally gets to understand more of what's happening and accepts Christ, he ultimately knows that the Lord will be returning -- and even the time because he alarm is set for some reason. It's an alright film but not scriptural in this area.SPOILER: I think that it might have been interesting if, when the man came to Christ because of the strangeness of the day repeating, the event stopped happening when he accepted Him...but the rapture did NOT take place. So, he'd not know when it would take place and it was just a bizarre phenomenon.OTHER THOUGHTS:- There is some violence. For example, he is killed a couple times; note that he never tries to end his own life, like in ""Groundhog"").- As for other's revieweres thinking that there's a type of nudity or too much skin, that is very unfounded. Only the main ladies are in bikinis and they are very modest; the leadingman (actor David White) is shirtless just once or so. Nothing offensive in this department.- The one part that is especially silly in the script is when people disappear right in front of a few people on the yacht...and only the main character actually has some kind ofreaction. The others act just stand around like it is nothing out of the ordinary...and start to blame the man for having something to do with it because his watch had an alarm going off right before the event. They wonder what he did to them.- The scenery is wonderful and there's very nice filming of birds, dolphins, and sunsets. It's a beautiful location.- On the DVD, there is a commentary with the film and a behind the scenes featurette. As for the subtitles, they are disappointing.

1285829,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B002RIKAC6,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[14, 14]","I must join the majority of reviews that suggest this is 4 to 5 stars worthy based upon the fact it's an action packed thriller with a Christian plot and a crime sub-plot. Two cops, one a Christian, save a kidnapped star, but in the action one cop is down, then kills a killer. It's fast, but not as fast as The Rapture which becomes the bulk of the plot. The cop team, with spouses, get a weekend aboard a yacht. There all encounter more crime, as well as facing choices of salvation and eternity. This is obviously a faith-based film and since it's about Revelations and the Rapture, reminiscent of ""Left Behind"", it's not low-key religion. It's God in your face for the unsaved cop, David, and his wife too.If you find the Christian explanation of eternity and the afterlife offensive and wrong, then this movie will not be enjoyed. It follows the Gospel, including two translations of John 3:16. David is played by David A.R.White (also directing, writing, producing) who's spouse (Andrea Logan White, real spouse too) makes a decision to believe in Jesus as God's earth sent salvation prior to David's dreams warning him of the Rapture to come. They are dreams, not a recurring Rapture, which some viewers get confused about. That is made quite clear in the end, but not while the repeated day is occurring. So watch it all. Also, ""Jesus"", the very name, is specifically mentioned as the way to salvation for eternity by at least 5 characters, obviously those among the taken when the ultimate Rapture does take place, when it is no longer just a nightmare. Again, if your faith is not one of acceptance of God's Son Christ Jesus, as Lord, then your faith will be questioned with this film and it may not be an acceptable viewing for you. Although this film says nothing negative about other faiths, it certainly pushes the emphasis that Christianity is the way.That type of film making is what the lead couple, married in real life, do as a profession as well as ministry. Christian faith based filming. Internet search David A.R. White's name and you'll find a long list of film involvement, primarily Christian. Most not as conversion pressing as this film, but it has just as much action, gun play, fighting, and other cop type action. Nothing wrong with the sea/seaside scenery too. Okay, one fault, although this film has subtitles, they soon start to run behind the dialogue, at least on my copy.Eric Roberts is also in this film, just a bit more than a cameo, the cop partner's boss, and he's witnessed to by David but you'll have to see the film to know who all is left behind.I viewed the film twice, second time observant of other reviewer's objections, before reviewing myself. I found it theologically sound, but them I'm a fundamental Christian, not easily offended with a strong salvation theme.",5,Plenty of action prior to the end days' Rapture,1325980800,"01 8, 2012",2012,2815,"['must', 'join', 'majority', 'reviews', 'suggest', '4', '5', 'stars', 'worthy', 'based', 'fact', 'action', 'packed', 'thriller', 'Christian', 'plot', 'crime', 'sub-plot', 'Two', 'cops', 'one', 'Christian', 'save', 'kidnapped', 'star', 'action', 'one', 'cop', 'down', 'then', 'killer', 'fast', 'not', 'as', 'fast', 'Rapture', 'bulk', 'plot', 'cop', 'team', 'spouses', 'get', 'weekend', 'yacht', 'encounter', 'more', 'crime', 'as', 'well', 'facing', 'choices', 'salvation', 'eternity', 'obviously', 'faith-based', 'film', 'Revelations', 'Rapture', 'reminiscent', 'Left', 'Behind', 'not', 'low-key', 'religion', 'God', 'face', 'unsaved', 'cop', 'David', 'wife', 'too.If', 'find', 'Christian', 'explanation', 'eternity', 'afterlife', 'offensive', 'wrong', 'then', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'Gospel', 'including', 'two', 'translations', 'John', '3:16', 'David', 'played', 'David', 'A.R.White', 'also', 'directing', 'writing', 'producing', 'who', 'spouse', 'Andrea', 'Logan', 'White', 'real', 'spouse', 'too', 'decision', 'believe', 'Jesus', 'God', 'earth', 'sent', 'salvation', 'prior', 'David', 'dreams', 'warning', 'Rapture', 'come', 'are', 'dreams', 'not', 'recurring', 'Rapture', 'viewers', 'get', 'confused', 'about', 'made', 'quite', 'clear', 'end', 'not', 'repeated', 'day', 'occurring', 'So', 'watch', 'Also', 'Jesus', 'very', 'name', 'specifically', 'mentioned', 'way', 'salvation', 'eternity', 'least', '5', 'characters', 'obviously', 'taken', 'when', 'ultimate', 'Rapture', 'take', 'place', 'when', 'no', 'longer', 'just', 'nightmare', 'Again', 'faith', 'not', 'one', 'acceptance', 'God', 'Son', 'Christ', 'Jesus', 'Lord', 'then', 'faith', 'will', 'be', 'questioned', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'acceptable', 'viewing', 'film', 'nothing', 'negative', 'other', 'faiths', 'certainly', 'emphasis', 'Christianity', 'way.That', 'type', 'film', 'making', 'what', 'lead', 'couple', 'married', 'real', 'life', 'do', 'profession', 'as', 'well', 'ministry', 'Christian', 'faith', 'based', 'filming', 'Internet', 'search', 'David', 'A.R', 'White', 'name', ""'ll"", 'find', 'long', 'list', 'film', 'involvement', 'primarily', 'Christian', 'Most', 'not', 'conversion', 'pressing', 'film', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'action', 'gun', 'play', 'fighting', 'other', 'cop', 'type', 'action', 'Nothing', 'wrong', 'sea/seaside', 'scenery', 'too', 'Okay', 'one', 'fault', 'film', 'subtitles', 'soon', 'start', 'run', 'dialogue', 'least', 'copy.Eric', 'Roberts', 'also', 'film', 'just', 'bit', 'more', 'cameo', 'cop', 'partner', 'boss', 'witnessed', 'David', ""'ll"", 'have', 'see', 'film', 'know', 'who', 'left', 'behind.I', 'viewed', 'film', 'twice', 'second', 'time', 'observant', 'other', 'reviewer', 'objections', 'reviewing', 'found', 'theologically', 'sound', ""'m"", 'fundamental', 'Christian', 'not', 'easily', 'offended', 'strong', 'salvation', 'theme']",N/A

1285831,A2HIVYSH5QAV7Z,B002RIKAC6,"John A. M. Darnell ""Pedantic Voracious""","[0, 1]","Why not use the same literary instrument that Hollywood and other mainstream media types use to get their points across?  The time traveler who goes back time and time again reliving the events of a single day until he/she finds out The Big Secret and lives happily ever after, in this case more true than most.  It was a good way to discuss some important points.  Why did I give it three stars?First, let me discuss the good points.  The theology is right on (with perhaps the discussion of the Rapture and its point on the timeline, which is by no means certain) that is, the salvation message is right on.  The cinematography was well done and the overall storyline interesting enough to pull you in, if you are already saved.  There were plenty of scriptural disclaimers with regard to the actual time of Christ's Second Coming that no one can get into the trap of suggesting that there was something out of kilter, here.  And it had a really satisfying end.  When Detective Ramsey advises his boss to not take The Mark even I, who knows exactly what he was referring to had to think for a moment, but when it finally hit, I had to whoop my pleasure at understanding what the authors were trying to say.  This is not a bad film.  For Christians.And that's why the three stars. Its not a bad film.  For Christians.  The authors use standard cliche phrases to explain the Gospel  ""God has a plan for your life."" Absolutely true, but most people will grunt and pass it by.  ""For God so loved the world..."" one of my favorite verses, and yet the public has heard it so much that it is (to their ears, not mine) stale.  We know what's behind all of this talk, but the average sinner does not, and there just isn't enough time in a two-hour movie to get the point across,it would seem, without the movie makers resorting to the Christian sound bite of the moment.But that's not all that doomed this otherwise fine film to three stars.  At times the conversation was just plain wooden.  And the actors felt unreal; perhaps two-dimensional in their portrayal, though not in the character-building, which was actually quite good.  Maybe it was the fact that there wasn't enough in this film to make me really care about these people. It was kind of like my reaction to the characters in HOUSE (Frank Peretti and Ted Dekker).  Why in the world should I care about them?  Why in the world should I care about David and his wife or for that matter, the rock star female who plays a significant background part in the story.  And finally, all other comments WRT the scripture quoting notwithstanding, when salvation comes and the newly saved individual suddenly gains an understanding of the Bible and an ability to quote its contents that life-long dedicated Lay Christians cannot display, the credibility of the story suffers.  I've seen this in other works, like the very fine novel, THE SIN EATER, where the female lead character finds Christ and two hours later is quoting scripture like a professional. If God uses new converts to speak the Gospel, He usually gives them their own words, not the King James Version. Or, for that matter, words from the pamphlet, ""God has a plan for your life.""Should you watch this movie?  Why not?  It was fun, and like I already said, the ending is quite satisfying.  Just remember that you are not getting the high quality film making that we see in the *Left Behind* movies, or *The Omega Code* or *Six*.
