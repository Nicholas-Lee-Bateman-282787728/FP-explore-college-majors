Storyboard and caracter development walk hand in hand to pull the viewer along. The sets are not first rate Hollywood, but certainly well above average for this type of show.There's no overt sexuality and the OTT bloodlust and bloodletting that can caracterise series of this type are pleasantly, for the most part, absent.The series takes the viewer through various aspects of mythology and demonology from diverse global cultures, it seems to hold very close to the accepted myths for each as it weaves them into a stong storyline comprising a private detective losing her sight, her centuries old partner - Henry, and throws in the dynamic human triangle with her ex-police partner still showing in each episode.This non-love triangle explodes in betrayal, animosity, reparations and what could ultimately result in enduring bonds about halfway through the first season.The writers outdid themselves with a very difficult often over used and poorly exploited subject.At the price point I can only describe it as excellent value for money, I would not hesitate to recommend it to any interested in the genere.",4,Entertainment in spades,1329868800,"02 22, 2012",2012,1635,"['found', 'develish', 'amount', 'enjoy', 'series', 'purchase', 'made', 'largely', 'dark.Blood', 'Ties', 'was', 'not', 'series', ""'d"", 'ever', 'heard', 'before', 'possibly', 'was', 'briefly', 'run', 'Canadian', 'import.It', 'set', 'Toronto', 'passing', 'resemblence', 'earlier', 'knight', 'series', 'beaten', 'almost', 'area.Blood', 'Ties', 'better', 'acting', 'better', 'sets', 'more', 'dynamic', 'interesting', 'storylines.The', 'first', 'series', 'caracters', 'episodes', 'roll', 'forward', 'are', 'well', 'dealt', 'writers', 'Storyboard', 'caracter', 'development', 'walk', 'hand', 'hand', 'pull', 'viewer', 'sets', 'are', 'not', 'first', 'rate', 'Hollywood', 'certainly', 'well', 'average', 'type', 'show.There', 'overt', 'sexuality', 'OTT', 'bloodlust', 'bloodletting', 'can', 'caracterise', 'series', 'type', 'are', 'pleasantly', 'most', 'part', 'absent.The', 'series', 'viewer', 'various', 'aspects', 'mythology', 'demonology', 'diverse', 'global', 'cultures', 'hold', 'very', 'close', 'accepted', 'myths', 'stong', 'storyline', 'comprising', 'private', 'detective', 'losing', 'sight', 'centuries', 'old', 'partner', 'Henry', 'dynamic', 'human', 'triangle', 'ex-police', 'partner', 'still', 'showing', 'episode.This', 'non-love', 'triangle', 'explodes', 'betrayal', 'animosity', 'reparations', 'what', 'could', 'ultimately', 'result', 'enduring', 'bonds', 'halfway', 'first', 'season.The', 'writers', 'outdid', 'very', 'difficult', 'often', 'used', 'poorly', 'exploited', 'price', 'point', 'can', 'only', 'describe', 'excellent', 'value', 'money', 'would', 'not', 'hesitate', 'recommend', 'interested', 'genere']",Blood Ties: Season 1

1238840,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B001UGJUSG,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[4, 7]","Throughout the 1980's, Canadian fantasy author Tanya Huff was known for creating the ""Quarters"" and ""Wizard Crystal"" series.  But in the 1990's, she released books known as ""The Blood books"" about a detective named Vicki Nelson who teams up with a vampire to take on cases that are often supernatural.Huff created a total of five books plus a short story collection and in 2007, her books were adapted into a television series by Peter Mohan in Canada and aired on Lifetime Television and Citytv and Space in Canada.  The first season is now available on DVD.The characters of Blood Ties are as follows:Victoria ""Vicki"" Nelson (Christina Cox) - A former police officer who is now a private investigator who was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa (she is slowly going blind).  She was given an opportunity to work a desk job but declined.  She has left her job and her former boyfriend (Detective Mike Celluci) behind in order to pursue her career as an investigator.  But things change when she starts discovering grizzly murders and after an encounter with a vampire named Henry Fitzroy, who she ends up partnering and even having an interest in.Henry Fitzroy (Kyle Schmid) -  The legitimate heir to Henry VIII's throne but chose to love a woman named Christina and sacrificed his life for her and became a vampire.  Several hundred years later, he has made a life as a graphic novelist in Toronto and has taken an interest towards Vicki.Detective Mike Celluci (Dylan Neal) - Vicki's former partner at the police force but also her former lover.  Mike's relationship with Vicki has not been the same since she quit.  But with these new murders in the city and her investigating, he finds himself closer to her but at the same time having some sort of suspicion about Henry.Coreen Fennel (Gina Holden) - A goth like college student with knowledge of the occult who has been trying to find out who killed her boyfriend.  During the night of the murder, her boyfriend described what could be vampire and the first person she goes to for help is Investigator Vicki Nelson.Included on the box set are a total of four DVD's which contain a total of 13 episodes.  Included are:1. Episode 1 - Blood Price - Part One - Vicki is a private investigator hired by Coreen to find out who killed her boyfriend.  Through the process, she realizes that the murders in town may not be human, probably supernatural and confirms her suspicion when she encounters the vampire Henry Fitzroy.2. Episode 2 - Blood Price - Part Two - Coreen has been kidnapped by her boyfriend's killer and now Vicki and her vampire partner Henry must save her.3. Episode 3 - Bad Juju - Vicki has been hired by a client who practices voodoo who wants to find out what happened to her brother.  Meanwhile, she is being hunted by a zombie.  Vicki asks Henry for his help.4. Episode 4 - Gifted - Mike has his suspicions about Henry Fitzroy and Vicki encounters a girl who has telekinetic powers that controls a demon.5. Episode 5 - Deadly Departed - A witch and a vengeful spirit have targeted Vicki and Mike.6. Episode 6 - Love Hurts - A man hires Vicki to find out if his wife has been cheating on him but while she investigates, the wife is found dead.  Who is the culprit?7. Episode 7 - Heart of Ice - The homeless have gone missing and Vicki tries to investigate their disappearance.  Meanwhile, Mike is investigating a prostitute who has been drained of her blood and suspects Henry.8. Episode 8 - Heart of Fire - Vicki and Mike must get to Henry who has been held hostage.9. Episode 9 - Stone Cold - Vicki and Henry confront Medusa.10. Episode 10 - Necrodome - Diesel Swanson, a professional boxer has gone missing.  But something is awry when Diesel is seen on video walking out of the funeral home.11. Episode 11 - Post Partum - Vicki investigates a man's wife who has isolated herself inside a clinic.12. Episode 12 - Norman - Norman has returned from hell and attempts to revive his demon master.13. Episode 13 - D.O.A. - Vicki is visited by a co-worker from the police force who is dead and needs her help but perhaps this person is not what he claims to be.VIDEO & AUDIO:""BLOOD TIES"" is a series that is primarily shot indoors or the outdoors during the middle of the night.  The good news is that the series is clean even during low light conditions.  Most television series tend to exhibit low-light noise and can look quite terrible at times on DVD.For ""BLOOD TIES"", for the most part, the picture quality is featured in Standard Definition (4:3) and looks good.  I saw no major DVD compression artifacting.  But the series showcases dark colors and rarely do you see vibrant colors (well, reds and blues come out clear during the police sirens or the city lights utilizing stock video of the city of Toronto).  But for a television series, the picture quality is very good for a series shot mainly during the night and low-light conditions.Audio is featured in Dolby Digital Stereo and dialogue is heard clearly.  The series does have action scenes but for the most part, the film is dialogue driven.SPECIAL FEATURES:""BLOOD TIES - SEASON ONE"" comes with the following special features:* SPACE Behind the Scenes - Blood Ties - (24:02) A featurette featuring the cast talking about the series and their characters.* Trailer - (2:43) The original trailer for ""BLOOD TIES"".JUDGMENT CALL:Overall, ""BLOOD TIES"" was an entertaining series.  I've never read the original books but with my enjoyment of vampire/supernatural shows, I figured that this series would be quite exciting to watch.With the romance factor being explored between vampires and humans with a film like ""Twilight"" and a TV series like ""True Blood"", I have been wanting something along the lines of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" or ""Angel"".I enjoyed the darkness of the series and its characters and how each case was significantly different (ie. like Angel) but I suppose where ""Angel"" worked was within its characters and how entertaining those characters were in a humorous type of way.""BLOOD TIES"" showcases former police officers who are focused on doing their jobs, whereas in ""Angel"", the characters had their fault, their quirks but most importantly a charm of how they would react towards various situations.The formula for the first season of ""BLOOD TIES"" was too safe.  You have Vicki as the  Gung-ho investigator who takes on any case.  And if that case is too much for her, her vampire friend Henry must help and protect her.  Meanwhile, her former lover at the PD must also help her but is concerned about the new man that Vicki has been spending time with.  Thus the beginning of a love triangle and they all must put away their differences and work together.I felt that this good girl/bad boy routine between Vicki and Henry was played too safely.  Even the season finale, I was expecting that maybe there would be some wild twist.  Expecting some sort of cliffhanger and perhaps maybe I was spoiled by the two Joss Whedon series that a vampire and human can never be together.Something explored on ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and also on ""Twilight"" but was hoping would happen on ""BLOOD TIES"" are the repercussions of a human and vampire working together.  Perhaps something would happen to Henry and maybe he would attack Vicki or Mike and lose control.  I just wanted some type of consequence and although the cases remained the same, it seemed as if each week, the same usual things were being played out with reptition.As far as the episodes go, they are entertaining and some episodes are nice, dark and are filled with action.  I definitely want to know more about what the marks are on Vicki's wrists and what is going to happen with her character with her eye sight problem and her love triangle that she currently is in.  And of course, I'm sure we will have more of crazy character Norman in future episodes.With a good number of vampire based shows on television and with the series being shown on Lifetime, I think that ""BLOOD TIES"" somehow was lost in the shuffle and unfortunately, the series was canceled after the first season in the US, while our Canadian and UK counterparts have enjoyed the second season.I often wonder after watching this first season, that perhaps the series evolves to something different with season 2.  Perhaps more additional characters and more dramatic situations and even a grave threat, especially whatever ties into the mysteries that were left with the viewer after this first season.I feel that there is so much story (and potential)  from these books the series is based on,  that have yet to be told, and that the first season is just more about character development for now.  Perhaps that there are some more intense situations that would be addressed.  And if so, I can only hope that season 2 gets an American release on DVD.Overall, I felt that the series was entertaining but for this first season alone, it was a good start but it was average at best.",3,An entertaining vampire TV series that didn't have the wow factor I was hoping for...,1246060800,"06 27, 2009",2009,8958,"['1980', 'Canadian', 'fantasy', 'author', 'Tanya', 'Huff', 'was',

1238842,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B001UGJUSG,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[32, 33]","Vampires are very hot right now -- the bestselling ""Twilight"" series, the hit TV show ""True Blood,"" and the tragically cancelled ""Moonlight.""And one of the better vampire stories to emerge from the crypt is ""Blood Ties,"" a too-brief show based on Tanya Huff's urban fantasy series. The first season has a slightly slow start, but it's a solid action/fantasy series with plenty of sensual romance, gritty crime, and supernatural spookery.On her way back from a date, PI Vicki Nelson (Christina Cox) sees a caped figure attack and kill a young man -- leaving the body drained of blood. The victim's girlfriend hires Vicki to find the culprit. But as Vicki starts prodding around goth clubs and alleyways, she encounters the mysterious Henry Fitzroy (Kyle Schmid) who is doing his own murder investigation.Turns out Henry is also a sexy 500-year-old vampire, and the bastard son of Henry VII. Together they have to find a creepy demon-summoner, before something far worse is unleashed. And soon she has to deal with a lot of other supernatural problems, with the help of Henry and her former partner Mike (Dylan Neal), who loathe one another.Among the problems: voodoo priest and his zombies, a murderous ""imaginary friend,"" a heart-crushing Celtic ghost, a suburban incubi, a man-eating Wendigo, Egyptian gods, a Medusa, a fertility clinic that produces creepy results, the return of creepy demon-summoning dude, and an immortal priest with an unending vendetta against Henry.""Blood Ties Season One"" fits into the same niche as ""Moonlight"" and ""The Dresden Files"" -- a detective series with vampires and spooky things, and a human mired in the supernatural. But it's not entirely the same -- ""Blood Ties"" has a distinctly dark, grimy feel, with lots of pale light, shadowy urban streets and a unique vampire (""I don't have mojo. I have charm!"").It also has a nice murky mystery in each episode, with monsters ranging from notorious (zombies!) to obscure (svartalfar!), tightly wound action scenes and some very sensual bloodsucking. And the writers spin up some lovely dialogue for Vicki and Henry, usually to each other (""It's just a conversation, it's nothing to worry about."" ""That's what my father said to Anne Boleyn"").And Cox is excellent as Vicki -- tough, strong and capable of handling her own life, but with the vulnerability of a degenerative eye disease. And she's backed by Neal as a skeptical, straight-and-narrow cop who obviously has a thing for Vicki, and Gina Holden as a perky Goth who appoints herself Vicki's new secretary/gofer/research assistant.And Schmid is the perfect good-guy vampire -- he's devastatingly hot, and he mingles impish charm, sensuality, ferocity and down-to-earth quirkiness (""If this book isn't at the printer's by the end of the month, my editor's gonna kill me... again!""). His most brilliant work is the prolonged torture of ""Heart of Fire,"" especially during Henry's heartrending struggle against his bloodthirst.""Blood Ties Season One"" starts off a little slow, but the solid writing and excellent acting make this one of the better vampire shows to hit TV screens.",5,I never change,1236297600,"03 6, 2009",2009,3112,"['Vampires', 'are', 'very', 'hot', 'right', 'now', 'bestselling', 'Twilight', 'series', 'hit', 'TV', 'show', 'True', 'Blood', 'tragically', 'cancelled', 'Moonlight', 'one', 'better', 'vampire', 'stories', 'emerge', 'crypt', 'Blood', 'Ties', 'too-brief', 'show', 'based', 'Tanya', 'Huff', 'urban', 'fantasy', 'series', 'first', 'season', 'slightly', 'slow', 'start', 'solid', 'action/fantasy', 'series', 'plenty', 'sensual', 'romance', 'gritty', 'crime', 'supernatural', 'spookery.On', 'way', 'back', 'date', 'PI', 'Vicki', 'Nelson', 'Christina', 'Cox', 'caped', 'figure', 'attack', 'kill', 'young', 'man', 'leaving', 'body', 'drained', 'blood', 'victim', 'girlfriend', 'Vicki', 'find', 'culprit', 'Vicki', 'prodding', 'clubs', 'alleyways', 'mysterious', 'Henry', 'Fitzroy', 'Kyle', 'Schmid', 'who', 'doing', 'own', 'murder', 'out', 'Henry', 'also', 'sexy', '500-year-old', 'vampire', 'bastard', 'son', 'Henry', 'VII', 'Together', 'have', 'find', 'creepy', 'demon-summoner', 'something', 'far', 'worse', 'unleashed', 'soon', 'deal', 'lot', 'other', 'supernatural', 'problems', 'help', 'Henry', 'former', 'partner', 'Mike', 'Dylan', 'Neal', 'who', 'loathe', 'one', 'problems', 'voodoo', 'priest', 'zombies', 'murderous', 'imaginary', 'friend', 'heart-crushing', 'Celtic', 'ghost', 'suburban', 'incubi', 'man-eating', 'Wendigo', 'Egyptian', 'gods', 'Medusa', 'fertility', 'clinic', 'creepy', 'results', 'return', 'creepy', 'demon-summoning', 'dude', 'immortal', 'priest', 'unending', 'vendetta', 'Henry', 'Blood', 'Ties', 'Season', 'One', 'same', 'niche', 'Moonlight', 'Dresden', 'Files', 'detective', 'series', 'vampires', 'spooky', 'things', 'human', 'mired', 'supernatural', 'not', 'entirely', 'same', 'Blood', 'Ties', 'distinctly', 'dark', 'grimy', 'feel', 'lots', 'pale', 'light', 'shadowy', 'urban', 'streets', 'unique', 'vampire', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'mojo', 'have', 'charm', '.It', 'also', 'nice', 'murky', 'mystery', 'episode', 'monsters', 'ranging', 'notorious', 'zombies', 'obscure', 'svartalfar', 'tightly', 'action', 'scenes', 'very', 'sensual', 'bloodsucking', 'writers', 'spin', 'up', 'lovely', 'dialogue', 'Vicki', 'Henry', 'usually', 'other', 'just', 'conversation', 'nothing', 'worry', 'about', 'what', 'father', 'said', 'Anne', 'Boleyn', '.And', 'Cox', 'excellent', 'Vicki', 'tough', 'strong', 'capable', 'handling', 'own', 'life', 'vulnerability', 'degenerative', 'eye', 'disease', 'backed', 'Neal', 'skeptical', 'straight-and-narrow', 'cop', 'who', 'obviously', 'thing', 'Vicki', 'Gina', 'Holden', 'perky', 'Goth', 'who', 'Vicki', 'new', 'secretary/gofer/research', 'assistant.And', 'Schmid', 'perfect', 'good-guy', 'vampire', 'devastatingly', 'hot', 'impish', 'charm', 'sensuality', 'ferocity', 'down-to-earth', 'quirkiness', 'book', ""n't"", 'printer', 'end', 'month', 'editor', 'gon', 'kill', 'again', 'most', 'brilliant', 'work', 'prolonged', 'torture', 'Heart', 'Fire', 'especially', 'Henry', 'heartrending', 'struggle', 'bloodthirst', 'Blood', 'Ties', 'Season', 'One', 'little', 'slow', 'solid', 'writing', 'excellent', 'acting', 'make', 'one', 'better', 'vampire', 'shows', 'hit', 'TV', 'screens']",Blood Ties: Season 1

But as her secretary advertises in their ad, ""no case is too strange"" for them.I'm watching the first season now and there's not a lot of sex, but some sexual tension. There's a lot of humor between the main three characters...Vicky, Henry, and Mike (Vicky's old partner at the police department). There's a lot of suspense, a lot of humor, and really entertaining. If you like the Sookie Stackhouse books, you will love this show.Vicky gets demon marks on her early in the first season so she has some defense against these supernatural forces she has to deal with and Henry is her back up plan, but Mike also does his share of helping out.

1238858,A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB,B001UGJUSG,"Sarah ""Eat Dessert First""","[125, 127]","Blood Ties is a Canadian production that was filmed as a 22-episode season. In the US, Lifetime TV decided to split was was actually one season into two, with the first eleven episodes (""Blood Price"" to ""Post Partum"") as Season One and the remaining eleven (""Norman"" to ""Deep Dark"") as Season Two. Blood Ties fans have waited desperately for any news after Lifetime dropped the show like a hot potato despite intensive fan campaigns including blood drives and donations to charities. Their decision to split the show into two is unfortunate from a DVD standpoint; The British Blood Ties box set features all 22 episodes, but the US release features what is essentially half the (only) season. However, there are some excellent episodes here, such as the two-part Heart of Ice / Heart of Fire and the two-part pilot Blood Price. However, where the British set was devoid of extras, the US version will feature behind-the-scenes materials (and there was rumor of a gag/blooper reel mentioned in an interview). The release for Season Two is tentatively scheduled for September 2009; with the popularity ofMoonlight - The Complete Series,True Blood: The Complete First Season (HBO Series), andTwilight (Two-Disc Special Edition), sales should be high.Blood Ties revolves around Victoria ""Vicki"" Nelson, an ex-cop with Toronto's Metro police. Vicki was forced to resign due to a degenerative eye disease, retinitis pigmentosa, and is trying to make a living as a private investigator. Her fiery romance with fellow cop Mike Celluci is an on-again, off-again affair, and her first case as a PI gives her more than she bargained for: someone is summoning demonic forces, and Henry Fitzroy, her new partner on the case, just happens to be a 480-year-old vampire and is the illegitimate son of Henry VIII.The series pilot Blood Price is faithfully based on Tanya Huff'sBlood Price (BLOOD SERIES). The remainder of the season finds Vicki exploring demons, incubi, reanimated corpses, shapeshifters, mummies, voodoo, ghosts...while caught in a crackling love triangle between former flame Mike and sensual, deadly Henry. Vicki's new assistant is the perky Goth Coreen, who also has her eye on Henry.Blood Ties consistently satisfies my cravings for an intelligently handled supernatural cop drama. Its premise sounds promising in print, but without Blood Ties' cleverly crafted story arcs and meaningful character interaction, it would amount to little more than a tired monster-movie-of-the-week retread. This is a show that wisely knows not to take itself too seriously, leading to fast and furious one-liners, visual gags and impeccable comedic timing. The entire Canadian cast and crew does a consistently amazing job of bringing Blood Ties to life, and it's great to see a Canadian production receive airtime in the States.The show's setting is Toronto but is filmed in Vancouver (with exterior shots of identifying Toronto landmarks), but it's still Canadian through-and-through, a rarity in days where tired Toronto is expected to double as Everyamericancity. This may be the first show sinceForever Knight - The Trilogy, Part 1 (1992 - 1993)andDue South: The Ultimate Collection - Three Complete Seasonsthat revels in its Canadianness.Although Blood Ties is currently off-air, its fan base continues to spread through word of mouth, Big Fish'sBlood Tieshidden object game featuring characters, locations, and audio from the show, and Internet groups, thereby bringing new viewers into the fold. It has been at least a decade since I felt so strongly about a TV show; I was so moved by Blood Ties' strong female role model and intriguing blend of romance, police procedural, and the supernatural that I downloaded several episodes via iTunes and recruited several friends to the show.Blood Ties remains my favorite post-Forever Knight - The Trilogy, Part 1 (1992 - 1993)for its enchanting blend of humor, passion, action, moral dilemmas, and the mortal (and immortal) ties that bind. Tanya Huff's source material has been toned down enough to allow families to enjoy Blood Ties together. Blood Ties protagonist Vicki Nelson (Christina Cox) is a strong positive role model for women through her physicality, self-reliance despite disability, and intelligence.It's instantly obvious (except to American/Canadian networks who were reluctant to pick up the show for a second season, grrr...) why Blood Ties was nominated for numerous awards such as Constellation and Leo Awards. The entire cast, headed by Christina Cox (Vicki), Kyle Schmid (Henry), Dylan Neal (Mike), and Gina Holden (Coreen), has an outstanding chemistry that shines on-screen, and I can't wait to finally own

My daughter and I decided to watch the whole thing again we loved it so much. The characters were so well cast and they are just great. Their chemistry together is amazing. I wasn't familiar with either of the guys, but they are both gorgeous, and I've always liked Christina Cox. She makes a perfect Vickie. I can't wait for Season 2 to come out in October. It's a real shame when a great show like this is canceled so quickly. Maybe if it had been on something other than Lifetime. I wonder if there is any chance someone else will pick it up.

Based on the excellent Blood series, written in the 1990's by Tanya Huff, the series follows the supernatural adventures of Vicki Nelson, a Toronto cop turned P.I., her former partner and lover, Mike Celucci, her perky goth assistant, Coreen Fennel, and Henry Fitzroy, a 450-year-old vampire who also happens to be the bastard son of Henry VIII.  The series actually improves as it goes along, with the final episodes packing some incredibly powerful dramatic punches.  Plus, it's often very funny, because all the actors playing the major characters have terrific comic timing, and the comic dialogue sparkles.As an added bonus, the primary cast--Christina, Dylan, Gina, and Kyle--are, quite literally, the prettiest cast you will ever see on a television.
