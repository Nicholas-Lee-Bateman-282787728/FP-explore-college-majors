He also was a most gifted make-up artistand when you watch his films he is 90% of the time completelydifferent. Robert De Niro who is a fine actor and put ona lot of weight and worked out for the role Raging Bull gotso much praise,and deserved it. I still would like to pointout that Lon Chaney was doing stuff like Bobbie in the 20's.For example Lon had to play a guy with no legs in the Penaltyand strapped his legs behind his back for long and excruciatingperiods of time.  He from what I read took method acting to thenext level for some people who worked with him said his secretto his art was that he was so into the role he was playing thathe became the character and was no longer acting the part butbeing! He supposedly was not easy to talk to when in characterand if conversation took place at the time of the movie shootingyou talked to who he was playing and not Lon.  He has playedall kinds of roles from a armless man to a old woman.  A cryingclown to a hunchback. A old Asian man to a Marine Sergeant.His most famous will always be The Phantom of the Opera whichstill till this day displays the most HORRIFIC face on celluloid.Please see Lon Chaney at least once in your life and find out whya actor like Peter Sellers has said THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHERONE LIKE HIM(quoted from HERE COMES THE STARS MAG.67) Some sayOlivier-Brando-Streep-De Niro-Pacino-Spacey and Spencer Tracyand they are very fine actors......But they are no CHANEY!",5,A ACTORS.......ACTOR!,1195430400,"11 19, 2007",2007,1596,"['Lon', 'simply', 'put', 'opinion', 'GREATEST', 'actor', 'who', 'ever', 'lived.He', 'was', 'born', 'deaf', 'parents', 'only', 'helped', 'expressionsand', 'mannerism', 'also', 'was', 'most', 'gifted', 'make-up', 'artistand', 'when', 'watch', 'films', '90', '%', 'time', 'completelydifferent', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'who', 'fine', 'actor', 'put', 'ona', 'lot', 'weight', 'worked', 'out', 'role', 'Raging', 'Bull', 'gotso', 'much', 'praise', 'deserved', 'still', 'would', 'like', 'pointout', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'was', 'doing', 'stuff', 'Bobbie', ""20's.For"", 'example', 'Lon', 'had', 'play', 'guy', 'legs', 'Penaltyand', 'strapped', 'legs', 'back', 'long', 'excruciatingperiods', 'time', 'what', 'read', 'took', 'method', 'acting', 'thenext', 'level', 'people', 'who', 'worked', 'said', 'secretto', 'art', 'was', 'was', 'so', 'role', 'was', 'playing', 'thathe', 'became', 'character', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'acting', 'part', 'butbeing', 'supposedly', 'was', 'not', 'easy', 'talk', 'when', 'characterand', 'conversation', 'took', 'place', 'time', 'movie', 'shootingyou', 'talked', 'who', 'was', 'playing', 'not', 'Lon', 'playedall', 'kinds', 'roles', 'armless', 'man', 'old', 'woman', 'cryingclown', 'hunchback', 'old', 'Asian', 'man', 'Marine', 'Sergeant.His', 'most', 'famous', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'whichstill', 'till', 'day', 'most', 'HORRIFIC', 'face', 'celluloid.Please', 'see', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'least', 'once', 'life', 'find', 'out', 'whya', 'actor', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'said', 'THERE', 'WILL', 'NEVER', 'BE', 'ANOTHERONE', 'LIKE', 'HIM', 'quoted', 'HERE', 'COMES', 'THE', 'STARS', 'MAG.67', 'sayOlivier-Brando-Streep-De', 'Niro-Pacino-Spacey', 'Spencer', 'Tracyand', 'are', 'very', 'fine', 'actors', 'are', 'CHANEY']",N/A

With silent films the actors had to convey their craft through expressions and body language, Lon Chaney did it best.Here, Chaney portrays Wilse Dilling a cripple (yes, we're not yet politically correct in the 1920s) a career criminal, that is sent by ""Queen Ann (Christine Mayo)--a crime lord to blackmail a highly respected banker (and her former love)in a small town.  Dilling meets the banker's daughter (Virginia Valli), falls in love and re-evaluates his life.The DVD transfer is pretty good, but is a bit grainy.  But this is a 1923 film and I was happy it could be perserved on this format for all to see.Please watch and appreciate this great classic film.Thanks Mr. Blackshere for giving me the desire to see this movie again.

I've had the privilege of seeing quite of few of his wonderful films, but this one is probably my favorite of all of them. While not in the ""horror"" genre of some of his movies, this one is suspenseful, romantic, and exciting without the macabre or melodramatic overtones that often took over in some of his later films.Released in 1923, ""The Shock"" centers around the criminal underworld in early 20th century San Francisco. Chaney gives a moving performance as Wilse Dilling, a crippled criminal who is sent to a small town to carry out orders from his cruel crime boss Queen Ann, but finds he cannot continue with his mission when he falls in love with the local banker's daughter. Playing the role 'straight' and avoiding reliance on heavy makeup as he did in ""Hunchback"", Lon makes Dilling a forceful and sympathetic character without seeming to overact him or make him too sentimental. His trademark facial expressions and pantomime acting are some of the best in his career, and his effective use of physical aptitude in the many scenes with Wilse's wheelchair and crutches perfectly capture the difficulties, constraints and frustrations of those who are disabled.The print quality of this DVD isn't that great, to be honest. There are prominent scratch marks and dust present in nearly every scene, but it is certainly far from  being just merely watchable. For a bargain edition of a film from 1923, it is actually pretty good.All in all, ""The Shock"" is a fantastic film. Fast-paced and full of action, drama, suspense, and pathos (not to mention an appropriate and surprising ending), it is one classic silent film not to be missed.",5,One of Lon Chaney's best films!,1312329600,"08 3, 2011",2011,1721,"['Lon', 'Chaney', 'was', 'doubt', 'one', 'best', 'actors', 'silent', 'film', 'era', ""'ve"", 'had', 'privilege', 'seeing', 'quite', 'few', 'wonderful', 'films', 'one', 'probably', 'favorite', 'not', 'horror', 'genre', 'movies', 'one', 'suspenseful', 'romantic', 'exciting', 'macabre', 'melodramatic', 'overtones', 'often', 'took', 'over', 'later', 'films.Released', '1923', 'Shock', 'centers', 'criminal', 'underworld', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Chaney', 'moving', 'performance', 'Wilse', 'Dilling', 'crippled', 'criminal', 'who', 'sent', 'small', 'town', 'carry', 'out', 'orders', 'cruel', 'crime', 'boss', 'Queen', 'Ann', 'can', 'not', 'continue', 'mission', 'when', 'love', 'local', 'banker', 'daughter', 'Playing', 'role', 'avoiding', 'reliance', 'heavy', 'makeup', 'did', 'Hunchback', 'Lon', 'Dilling', 'forceful', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'seeming', 'overact', 'make', 'too', 'sentimental', 'trademark', 'facial', 'expressions', 'pantomime', 'acting', 'are', 'best', 'career', 'effective', 'use', 'physical', 'aptitude', 'many', 'scenes', 'Wilse', 'wheelchair', 'crutches', 'perfectly', 'capture', 'difficulties', 'constraints', 'frustrations', 'who', 'are', 'disabled.The', 'print', 'quality', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'that', 'great', 'be', 'honest', 'are', 'prominent', 'scratch', 'marks', 'dust', 'present', 'nearly', 'scene', 'certainly', 'far', 'being', 'just', 'merely', 'watchable', 'bargain', 'edition', 'film', '1923', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good.All', 'Shock', 'fantastic', 'film', 'Fast-paced', 'full', 'action', 'drama', 'suspense', 'pathos', 'not', 'mention', 'appropriate', 'surprising', 'ending', 'one', 'classic', 'silent', 'film', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",N/A

At first I was sort of noting the novelty of not seeing Lon made up to look like the hunchback, or the phantom or whoever...and comparing him to later pictures...he seemed to change a lot. But after while I realized this was a pretty good story... In fact it started to impress me... afterwards, though probably too generous, I even compared it to City Lights for it's final effect. The acting was fair to middling, maybe even a bit better...though admittedly there is still some of the over-acting typical in silents to overcome no sound to convey thoughts, but even that is minimized. Extremely good as a silent drama...clear story, no losing you, and easy to follow...though you had to put a few things together. Again I compared it to City Lights in that I didn't miss sound...the movie seemed complete without it.The female star is incredibly beautiful (and not overly plastered up by white make-up as is typical for silents)...very nice eyes...looks a bit like Irene Dunn but even fairer.) Knowing how long the movie was I began to wonder...how is this going to end? That is the shock I wasn't expecting. Perhaps a bit contrived, but it still worked...I was wondering why I wasn't seeing any actual cars. Hint: do not look at the box too closely because as usual they give too much away. Just cut the wrapper off, and stick it in the player and let it surprise you...you wont be disappointed. When the movie ended I had a lump in my throat and a tear in my eye...real sentimental stuff that took you by surprise. I really had no idea where this was going and it took you on turns you just didn't expect. As a silent Drama this is definatly one of the better ones, maybe even one of the best...and funny things was, I don't think I'd ever even heard of it before!The music was good too and actually fit the movie for once. I even found myself humming it after it was all over. I ended up thinking about the movie for some time after it was over, like I had something no one knew about, like a secret or a treasure. If you like silents at all, you will treasure this one and if you are not familiar with them, this is a good silent drama to try out first.",5,Wow!
