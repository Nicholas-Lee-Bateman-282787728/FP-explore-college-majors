1115679,A25UZ7MA72SMKM,B000Y0791Y,Brent Butler,"[2, 2]","We're watching a Lawrence Welk Christmas show as I type this (the 1966 show on this DVD). As so many did, our family watched the show weekly when I was a kid. Eventually we took it for granted ... it was on week after week ... year after year ... and it seemed like it would always be there anytime we were in the mood to watch again. In the meantime we moved on to pop, to rock, to country, to disco, and all the other hip and trendy music that came along.In later years of my adult life I sometimes wondered, when I'd come across an ""old standard"" somewhere, how I mysteriously always seemed to know the words and just how the music was going to go. In recent years we stumbled across Lawrence Welk shows on PBS and I realized, ""Of course! I watched LW every week as a kid! Of course I know all the old standards!"" LOLThere were a few things you could ALWAYS count on from Lawrence Welk shows:1. Every note would be sung on key2. The orchestra would be flawless3. The sets and costuming would be colorful and interesting4. Bobbie and Barbara/Sissy would give one or two great dance performances5. There would be a great selection of music, all performed in the spirit it was originally intended to be performed6. The same outstanding band members and vocalists seemed to stay with him year after year. He must have been a pretty good guy to work for.The Lawrence Welk show goes far beyond the music. Over its run it superbly documented the history of our country in music, playing music from across decades of time and in virtually every genre.These Christmas shows are a brief but illuminating subset of their work. You'll literally never hear Christmas and seasonal music performed better than delivered by the Welk orchestra and cast. And when Norma Zimmer stepped out on the stage, you always knew you were in for a special treat. Welk's ""Champaign Lady"" could have had a great career as a singer anywhere, but was happy to grace us every week on TV. When you saw Myron Florin smile and crank up that accordion, you had no doubt that he was a genuinely nice man.Is Lawrence Welk ""old-fashioned""? Of course he is. It's an old-fashioned that we can't afford to lose track of. It's part of the history and the soul of this country.Enjoy.",5,Lawrence Welk goes far beyond the music,1387584000,"12 21, 2013",2013,2240,"[""'re"", 'watching', 'Lawrence', 'Welk', 'Christmas', 'show', 'type', '1966', 'show', 'DVD', 'so', 'many', 'did', 'family', 'watched', 'show', 'weekly', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'Eventually', 'took', 'granted', 'was', 'week', 'week', 'year', 'year', 'seemed', 'would', 'always', 'be', 'there', 'anytime', 'were', 'mood', 'watch', 'again', 'meantime', 'moved', 'pop', 'rock', 'country', 'disco', 'other', 'hip', 'trendy', 'music', 'came', 'along.In', 'later', 'years', 'adult', 'life', 'sometimes', 'wondered', 'when', ""'d"", 'come', 'old', 'standard', 'somewhere', 'how', 'mysteriously', 'always', 'seemed', 'know', 'words', 'just', 'how', 'music', 'was', 'going', 'go', 'recent', 'years', 'stumbled', 'across', 'Lawrence', 'Welk', 'PBS', 'realized', 'course', 'watched', 'LW', 'week', 'kid', 'course', 'know', 'old', 'standards', 'LOLThere', 'were', 'few', 'things', 'could', 'ALWAYS', 'count', 'Lawrence', 'Welk', 'shows:1', 'note', 'would', 'be', 'sung', 'key2', 'orchestra', 'would', 'be', 'flawless3', 'sets', 'costuming', 'would', 'be', 'colorful', 'interesting4', 'Bobbie', 'Barbara/Sissy', 'would', 'give', 'one', 'two', 'great', 'dance', 'performances5', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'selection', 'music', 'performed', 'spirit', 'was', 'originally', 'intended', 'be', 'performed6', 'same', 'outstanding', 'band', 'members', 'vocalists', 'seemed', 'stay', 'year', 'year', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'pretty', 'good', 'guy', 'work', 'for.The', 'Lawrence', 'Welk', 'show', 'far', 'music', 'run', 'superbly', 'documented', 'history', 'country', 'music', 'playing', 'music', 'decades', 'time', 'virtually', 'genre.These', 'Christmas', 'shows', 'are', 'brief', 'illuminating', 'subset', 'work', ""'ll"", 'literally', 'never', 'hear', 'Christmas', 'seasonal', 'music', 'performed', 'better', 'delivered', 'Welk', 'orchestra', 'cast', 'when', 'Norma', 'Zimmer', 'stepped', 'out', 'stage', 'always', 'knew', 'were', 'special', 'treat', 'Welk', 'Champaign', 'Lady', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'great', 'career', 'singer', 'anywhere', 'was', 'happy', 'grace', 'week', 'TV', 'When', 'saw', 'Myron', 'Florin', 'smile', 'crank', 'up', 'accordion', 'had', 'doubt', 'was', 'genuinely', 'nice', 'man.Is', 'Lawrence', 'Welk', 'old-fashioned', 'course', 'old-fashioned', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'lose', 'track', 'part', 'history', 'soul', 'country.Enjoy']",Lawrence Welk Christmas Shows

1115683,A13TO5TU4A68LD,B000Y0791Y,Gryphonisle,"[1, 23]","Well, first off, the older shows such as these aren't quite the anachronism the show became by the time if finally went off the air.  But still, I found myself wondering why everyone had to smile so much.  I like old music--I liked it when it, and I, weren't nearly as old as we are now, when most other kids were listening to the Rolling Stones and what not.  So I'm not a Lawrence Welk fan.  Never was.  Still, if you've got parents like mine, and you're looking for something like this, you might as well tune in for as long as you can stand it.  But, I also look at it in something of an anthropological mode and my, this ain't your typical big band.  Everybody smiles like a Stepford Wife.  I can think of some really great singers, Ella Fitzgerald comes to mind, and they can manage sing a tune, even a Christmas carol and not give you the feeling they're going to haunt you through the next election.You can't deny that this orchestra knows how to play, and you don't have to refer to the schmaltz level to admit it.  Guy Lombardo was no better, they just smiled a bit less.  There's talent in spades on this show, and the music is quite lovely (almost toxically so).  What I'd really like to see is someone tie this show into a larger picture and what it says about the cultural divide.  Lawrence Welk, even in this early stage (well before he inherited the reins of the schmaltz wagon) is quite clearly not just about the music, he related to a certain segment of the population in a way nobody else did, and they (my parents included) never forgot.  They didn't tune in for the last Benny Goodman concerts, never really bothered with the Jazz greats, and rarely tune in the documentaries of the Swing Era they lived through, but if they live in the markets where it's possible to do so, they tune in to PBS to watch Lawrence Welk.I hate to think what that says about Public Television.",2,Oh My.,1258070400,"11 13, 2009",2009,1895,"['Well', 'first', 'older', 'shows', 'such', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'anachronism', 'show', 'became', 'time', 'finally', 'went', 'air', 'still', 'found', 'wondering', 'why', 'everyone', 'had', 'smile', 'so', 'much', 'like', 'old', 'music', 'liked', 'when', 'were', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'old', 'are', 'now', 'when', 'most', 'other', 'kids', 'were', 'listening', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'what', 'not', ""'m"", 'not', 'Lawrence', 'Welk', 'fan', 'Never', 'was', 'Still', ""'ve"", 'got', 'parents', 'mine', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'tune', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'stand', 'also', 'look', 'something', 'anthropological', 'mode', 'ai', ""n't"", 'typical', 'big', 'band', 'Everybody', 'Stepford', 'Wife', 'can', 'think', 'really', 'great', 'singers', 'Ella', 'Fitzgerald', 'mind', 'can', 'manage', 'sing', 'tune', 'even', 'Christmas', 'carol', 'not', 'give', 'feeling', ""'re"", 'going', 'haunt', 'next', 'election.You', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deny', 'orchestra', 'how', 'play', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'refer', 'schmaltz', 'level', 'admit', 'Guy', 'Lombardo', 'was', 'better', 'just', 'smiled', 'bit', 'less', 'talent', 'spades', 'show', 'music', 'quite', 'lovely', 'almost', 'toxically', 'so', 'What', ""'d"", 'really', 'like', 'see', 'someone', 'tie', 'show', 'larger', 'picture', 'what', 'cultural', 'divide', 'Lawrence', 'Welk', 'even', 'early', 'stage', 'well', 'inherited', 'reins', 'schmaltz', 'wagon', 'quite', 'clearly', 'not', 'just', 'music', 'related', 'certain', 'segment', 'population', 'way', 'nobody', 'else', 'did', 'parents', 'included', 'never', 'forgot', 'did', ""n't"", 'tune', 'last', 'Benny', 'Goodman', 'never', 'really', 'bothered', 'Jazz', 'greats', 'rarely', 'tune', 'documentaries', 'Swing', 'Era', 'lived', 'live', 'markets', 'where', 'possible', 'do', 'so', 'tune', 'PBS', 'watch', 'Lawrence', 'Welk.I', 'hate', 'think', 'what', 'Public', 'Television']",Lawrence Welk Christmas Shows
