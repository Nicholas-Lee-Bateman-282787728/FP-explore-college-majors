784013,A3IKBHODOTYYHM,B0000UHFBC,"fra7299 ""fra7299""","[33, 35]","My suggestion is that you read the short story because it is more effective at telling a ""horror"" story than this movie can possibly depict. This film just does not capture the eeriness that Shirley Jackson's work tried to show.Sometimes filmmakers try overly hard to ""modernize"" a novel (or in this case, short story) and, in doing so, take out the power of the work. This film does just that, coming across more as a cheap B-movie than creating any type of creepiness. Not only this, but the acting and story are really hollow and wooden, coming across as something you might find at 8 or 9 on Lifetime. It just seems like some type of soap opera fluff, with amateurish actors.Another problem with the film is that, unlike the short story, there is too much information given, which seems to plague most of today's horror movies. Sometimes what is left to the imagination creates much more suspense, but with the constant ""flashbacks"" we can only guess what is going to happen in the small town of New Hope, where our protagonist goes in search of answers to his mother's death.  What we don't know, the subtle information that is lacking makes a story keeps its suspense intact. This movie seemingly gives it away within the first 10 minutes of the film, whereas in the short story you are kind of hit all of the sudden when it dawns on you what ""the lottery"" really is. A better imagination might have helped this film, but I guess that can't be expected with most films that are ""adapted"" to meet a work of fiction.If there is anything that is redeeming it is the last half hour of the film. This is the only part that really identifies with Shirley Jackson's short story, and some of the parallels are drawn here. Otherwise, it is mediocre at best.",3,Comes across as either a soap opera or a movie on Lifetime,1130716800,"10 31, 2005",2005,1754,"['suggestion', 'read', 'short', 'story', 'more', 'effective', 'telling', 'horror', 'story', 'movie', 'can', 'possibly', 'depict', 'film', 'just', 'not', 'capture', 'eeriness', 'Shirley', 'Jackson', 'work', 'tried', 'show.Sometimes', 'filmmakers', 'try', 'overly', 'hard', 'modernize', 'novel', 'case', 'short', 'story', 'doing', 'so', 'take', 'out', 'power', 'work', 'film', 'just', 'coming', 'across', 'more', 'cheap', 'B-movie', 'creating', 'type', 'creepiness', 'Not', 'only', 'acting', 'story', 'are', 'really', 'hollow', 'wooden', 'coming', 'something', 'might', 'find', '8', '9', 'Lifetime', 'just', 'type', 'soap', 'opera', 'fluff', 'amateurish', 'actors.Another', 'problem', 'film', 'short', 'story', 'too', 'much', 'information', 'given', 'plague', 'most', 'today', 'horror', 'movies', 'Sometimes', 'what', 'left', 'imagination', 'much', 'more', 'suspense', 'constant', 'flashbacks', 'can', 'only', 'guess', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'small', 'town', 'New', 'Hope', 'where', 'protagonist', 'search', 'answers', 'mother', 'death', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'subtle', 'information', 'lacking', 'story', 'suspense', 'intact', 'movie', 'seemingly', 'away', 'first', '10', 'minutes', 'film', 'whereas', 'short', 'story', 'are', 'kind', 'hit', 'sudden', 'when', 'what', 'lottery', 'really', 'better', 'imagination', 'might', 'have', 'helped', 'film', 'guess', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'expected', 'most', 'films', 'are', 'adapted', 'meet', 'work', 'fiction.If', 'anything', 'redeeming', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'film', 'only', 'part', 'really', 'Shirley', 'Jackson', 'short', 'story', 'parallels', 'are', 'drawn', 'here', 'Otherwise', 'mediocre', 'best']",N/A
