Goldberg,"[1, 1]","I first heard and saw Ormandy and the Philadelphia at the unlikely age of 14 ( 66 yearas ago), and in an unlikely location, my birthplace of Glasgow. Not even Disney's FANTASIA with the renowned Stokowski had prepared me for what was in store. It was therefore with joy and trepidation that I approached this 35-year old product. My fears quickly vanished as the crisp clear performance of the Firebird filled my basement, and I was totally enraptured by the sensuous interpretation of the Rachmaninoff. The first piece is one of the great masterpieces of modern ballet, and I have heard it massacred by the makeshift orchestras of many ballet theatres over the years. Here it was revealed in all its energetic and lyrical glory in a masterly interpretation that, coupled with the orchestral playing and the audio quality is as fine as I have heard in any medium. By contrast, the 2nd Symphony of Rachmaninoff is not in the first league,and yet Ormandy and his forces manage to invest it with a majesty that transcends the late 19th Century passionate vulgarity that characterizes many of its most dramatic passages. In their hands, one might even think of it as a credible offspring of Tchaikovsky's 7 Symphonies. I was not disappointed by the visual quality of this disc. All sections of this great orchestra are shown doing their stuff at appropriate times without short-changing the maestro on the podium. Audience rapport is also well conveyed. The only blot on the landscape was the hall itself that is about the ugliest I have seen in this medium, never having had the misfortune to see it in the flesh, although I enjoyed the orchestra many times in its summer home at Saratoga. I am looking forward to exploring other Ormandy recordings in this series, and warmly recommend this one to anyone anxious to experience the work of this under-rated musical craftsman.",5,The master at work,1357430400,"01 6, 2013",2013,1871,"['first', 'heard', 'saw', 'Ormandy', 'Philadelphia', 'unlikely', 'age', '14', '66', 'yearas', 'ago', 'unlikely', 'location', 'birthplace', 'Glasgow', 'Not', 'even', 'Disney', 'FANTASIA', 'renowned', 'Stokowski', 'had', 'prepared', 'what', 'was', 'store', 'was', 'therefore', 'joy', 'trepidation', 'approached', '35-year', 'old', 'product', 'fears', 'quickly', 'vanished', 'crisp', 'clear', 'performance', 'Firebird', 'filled', 'basement', 'was', 'totally', 'enraptured', 'sensuous', 'interpretation', 'Rachmaninoff', 'first', 'piece', 'one', 'great', 'masterpieces', 'modern', 'ballet', 'have', 'heard', 'massacred', 'makeshift', 'orchestras', 'many', 'ballet', 'theatres', 'years', 'Here', 'was', 'revealed', 'energetic', 'lyrical', 'glory', 'masterly', 'interpretation', 'coupled', 'orchestral', 'playing', 'audio', 'quality', 'as', 'fine', 'have', 'heard', 'medium', 'contrast', '2nd', 'Symphony', 'Rachmaninoff', 'not', 'first', 'league', 'yet', 'Ormandy', 'forces', 'manage', 'invest', 'majesty', 'late', '19th', 'Century', 'passionate', 'vulgarity', 'many', 'most', 'dramatic', 'passages', 'hands', 'one', 'might', 'even', 'think', 'credible', 'offspring', 'Tchaikovsky', '7', 'Symphonies', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'visual', 'quality', 'disc', 'sections', 'great', 'orchestra', 'are', 'shown', 'doing', 'stuff', 'appropriate', 'times', 'short-changing', 'maestro', 'podium', 'Audience', 'rapport', 'also', 'well', 'conveyed', 'only', 'blot', 'landscape', 'was', 'hall', 'ugliest', 'have', 'seen', 'medium', 'never', 'having', 'had', 'misfortune', 'see', 'flesh', 'enjoyed', 'orchestra', 'many', 'times', 'summer', 'home', 'Saratoga', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'exploring', 'other', 'Ormandy', 'recordings', 'series', 'warmly', 'recommend', 'one', 'anyone', 'anxious', 'experience', 'work', 'under-rated', 'musical', 'craftsman']",N/A

Knapp ""gpk""","[2, 2]","As this DVD and Ormandy's Holst/Debussy DVD are very similar in both the technical aspects and in terms of orchestral brilliance, please see also my review of Ormandy: Holst, The Planets and Debussy, La Mer. When I first listened to the Rachmaninov Second and Stravinsky's Firebird, I found myself bowled over by the lean, clear and transparent orchestral textures. This is no small feat, given Rachmaninov's rather over-ripe, lumpy instrumentation. At the time of these recordings (1977 and 1979), Ormandy, a diminutive but absolutely compelling presence on the podium, had his Philadelphians gradually weaned of the lush and overbearing Stokowski sound. The end result is playing on the highest level, with all orchestral voices shining forth in a glorious ensemble. And yes, there are quite a few personal touches in both works betraying the conductor's mature insights in this warhorse repertoire. The film is quite good, the audio even better, considering the age of these recordings.

1299344,A2PAD826IH1HFE,B002YOJC6S,J Scott Morrison,"[17, 18]","This DVD contains two Russian masterpieces played by the Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by Eugene Ormandy, who in his time was easily the leading interpreter of Russian music on the American scene, first in Minneapolis and then for forty-two years with the Philadelphia Orchestra. Further, he was a close personal and musical colleague of Sergei Rachmaninoff whose Second Symphony is heard here. Indeed, Ormandy and Rachmaninoff talked extensively about how to perform this work. After it was premi&egrave;red in 1908 with the composer conducting it became habit for the symphony, which lasts more than an hour, to be played with a number of cuts; that became the tradition and those cuts even appeared in the printed score. When it came time for Ormandy to play the work he consulted Rachmaninoff who had never liked the cuts, but Ormandy had made his own choices about cuts and after Rachmaninoff looked them over he approved them with the exception of one cut that was to be restored in the first movement. And that is what we get here in a performance recorded at the Academy of Music in 1979. I have heard many conductors play Rachmaninoff and I will admit that I always come back to Ormandy as the most satisfying. Rachmaninoff's music, particularly in this symphony, for all its rich mahogany sound can become molasses-y but that never happens when Ormandy is on the podium. I think that is because for all his innate musicality Ormandy was a no-nonsense, straight-ahead kind of conductor and he resisted any temptation to sentimentalize. This does not mean he does not lead Romantic performances; indeed, this performance is most satisfying in that respect. As for the Philadelphians, they are simply magnificent. Every department of the orchestra is in sensational form. One always hears compliments about their string sound, and of course that is warranted, but their woodwinds and brass are also amazing, not only the principals but the entire sections. The Rachmaninoff on this DVD is fully the equal of the well-known 1973 audio recording that Ormandy made with the orchestra, and it is actually in better sound. The visuals for this and the Stravinsky 'Firebird Suite' were under the direction of the then-doyen of American classical music television directors, Kirk Browning, and they are both unobtrusive and almost always appropriate. (Only once was I surprised when the camera was focusing on a bassoonist when it was the principal clarinet whose solo was being heard.)The DVD opens with a performance of Stravinsky's 1919 suite arrangement from the Firebird ballet music. The woodwinds have to be heard to be believed in the Variation of the Firebird (section two of the suite). The brass outdo themselves in the 'Infernal Dance of the Kashchei'. And one melts at the 'Berceuse'. Stupendous playing.There is one little extra, an introduction by Ormandy that comes between the two works. He talks about his relationship with Rachmaninoff in warm, human terms and one learns not only that Rachmaninoff treated him, even when Ormandy was very young and nervously leading a concerto performance with Rachy for the first time, with kindness and grace. And of course we know that Ormandy was the dedicatee of Rachmaninoff's last orchestral work, the Symphonic Dances, which Ormandy and the orchestra premi&egrave;red in early 1941.This one is definitely a keeper.Scott Morrison",5,A Match Made in Heaven,1264809600,"01 30, 2010",2010,3392,"['DVD', 'two', 'Russian', 'masterpieces', 'played', 'Philadelphia', 'Orchestra', 'conducted', 'Eugene', 'Ormandy', 'who', 'time', 'was', 'easily', 'leading', 'interpreter', 'Russian', 'music', 'American', 'scene', 'first', 'Minneapolis', 'then', 'forty-two', 'years', 'Philadelphia', 'Orchestra', 'Further', 'was', 'close', 'personal', 'musical', 'colleague', 'Sergei', 'Rachmaninoff', 'Second', 'Symphony', 'heard', 'here', 'Indeed', 'Ormandy', 'Rachmaninoff', 'talked', 'extensively', 'how', 'perform', 'work', 'was', 'premi', 'egrave', 'red', '1908', 'composer', 'conducting', 'became', 'habit', 'symphony', 'more', 'hour', 'be', 'played', 'number', 'cuts', 'became', 'tradition', 'cuts', 'even', 'appeared', 'printed', 'score', 'When', 'came', 'time', 'Ormandy', 'play', 'work', 'consulted', 'Rachmaninoff', 'who', 'had', 'never', 'liked', 'cuts', 'Ormandy', 'had', 'made', 'own', 'choices', 'cuts', 'Rachmaninoff', 'looked', 'approved', 'exception', 'one', 'cut', 'was', 'be', 'restored', 'first', 'movement', 'what', 'get', 'here', 'performance', 'recorded', 'Academy', 'Music', '1979', 'have', 'heard', 'many', 'conductors', 'play', 'Rachmaninoff', 'will', 'admit', 'always', 'come', 'back', 'Ormandy', 'most', 'satisfying', 'Rachmaninoff', 'music', 'particularly', 'symphony', 'rich', 'mahogany', 'sound', 'can', 'become', 'molasses-y', 'never', 'when', 'Ormandy', 'podium', 'think', 'innate', 'musicality', 'Ormandy', 'was', 'no-nonsense', 'straight-ahead', 'kind', 'conductor', 'resisted', 'temptation', 'sentimentalize', 'not', 'mean', 'not', 'lead', 'Romantic', 'performances', 'indeed', 'performance', 'most', 'satisfying', 'respect', 'Philadelphians', 'are', 'simply', 'magnificent', 'department', 'orchestra', 'sensational', 'form', 'One', 'always', 'compliments', 'string', 'sound', 'course', 'warranted', 'woodwinds', 'brass', 'are', 'also', 'amazing', 'not', 'only', 'principals', 'entire', 'sections', 'Rachmaninoff', 'DVD', 'fully', 'equal', 'well-known', '1973', 'audio', 'recording', 'Ormandy', 'made', 'orchestra', 'actually', 'better', 'sound', 'visuals', 'Stravinsky', ""'Firebird"", 'Suite', 'were', 'direction', 'then-doyen', 'American', 'classical', 'music', 'television', 'directors', 'Kirk', 'Browning', 'are', 'unobtrusive', 'almost', 'always', 'appropriate', 'Only', 'once', 'was', 'surprised', 'when', 'camera', 'was', 'focusing', 'bassoonist', 'when', 'was', 'principal', 'clarinet', 'solo', 'was', 'being', 'heard', 'DVD', 'performance', 'Stravinsky', '1919', 'suite', 'arrangement', 'Firebird', 'ballet', 'music', 'woodwinds', 'have', 'be', 'heard', 'be', 'believed', 'Variation', 'Firebird', 'section', 'two', 'suite', 'brass', 'outdo', ""'Infernal"", 'Dance', 'Kashchei', 'one', 'melts', ""'Berceuse"", 'Stupendous', 'one', 'little', 'extra', 'introduction', 'Ormandy', 'two', 'works', 'relationship', 'Rachmaninoff', 'warm', 'human', 'terms', 'one', 'not', 'only', 'Rachmaninoff', 'treated', 'even', 'when', 'Ormandy', 'was', 'very', 'young', 'nervously', 'leading', 'concerto', 'performance', 'Rachy', 'first', 'time', 'kindness', 'grace', 'course', 'know', 'Ormandy', 'was', 'dedicatee', 'Rachmaninoff', 'last', 'orchestral', 'work', 'Symphonic', 'Dances', 'Ormandy', 'orchestra', 'premi', 'egrave', 'red', 'early', '1941.This', 'one', 'definitely', 'keeper.Scott', 'Morrison']",N/A

Perhaps I grew up too late to know how great Ormandy was, but I'm afraid I was one of the many who ignored his records, assuming they were old fashioned and lacking in interpretative depth.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  Here, Ormandy proves himself one of the master musicians of all time, never calling attention to that fact, but finding exactly the right tempi, the right balances, the right dynamics-- in short, perfection.  In other words, he was a supreme genius, just as Rachmaninov himself seemed to acknowledge, since he asked the conductor to help him with his works!  The technical aspects of this (especially the sound) are also miraculous.",5,One of the greatest DVDs you'll ever watch.  I had no idea Ormandy was one of the greatest musicians in history.
