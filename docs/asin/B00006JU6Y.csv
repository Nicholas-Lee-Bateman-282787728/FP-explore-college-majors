718919,A3KNGA5WIECM5V,B00006JU6Y,"Beth Fox ""Beth A. Fox""","[5, 7]","This film is not a classic, but it is an interesting portrayal of young adults growing up and moving on (or not.) It is 1987.  In a rundown neighborhood of West Berlin, a group in their late teens or early 20s envisions themselves to be revolutionary anarchists. A dozen years later, all but two have grown up and moved into adulthood. Those two, now over thirty, are still painting graffiti on police cars and protesting the opening of yet another Mercedes Benz showroom.  Suddenly, a bomb they had set (and had forgotten about) in 1987 explodes.  This event brings the past back into the lives of those who had become an advertising executive, a lawyer, a mother, and a society girl.  Their interaction with those still living the revolutionary life makes plain to the latter that -- for better or worse -- they are stuck in the past.This movie has problems.  For one thing, the premise is not terribly original, as this theme has been addressed before.  Additionally, these so-called revolutionaries don't inspire much sympathy.  How, exactly, did these people want to improve society?  The German generation of '68 was rebelling against their parents, particularly their fathers, but what precisely was the cause of the generation of '87?  And why set and leave a bomb in a building that someone might enter?  The characters come across more as spoiled brats than as people who really wanted to change the world for the better.The film succeeds in its various action sequences, involving a  police station and an old homemade film.  Overall, I'd give this movie three stars.  Worth seeing, but not a must-see.  A much more compelling look at German terrorists, and their lives in East Germany, is Volker Schlondorff's ""The Legend of Rita.""",3,This One Doesn't Set My Soul On Fire,1108684800,"02 18, 2005",2005,1743,"['film', 'not', 'classic', 'interesting', 'portrayal', 'young', 'adults', 'growing', 'up', 'moving', 'not', '1987', 'rundown', 'neighborhood', 'West', 'Berlin', 'group', 'late', 'teens', 'early', '20s', 'envisions', 'be', 'revolutionary', 'anarchists', 'dozen', 'years', 'later', 'two', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'moved', 'adulthood', 'two', 'now', 'thirty', 'are', 'still', 'painting', 'graffiti', 'police', 'cars', 'protesting', 'opening', 'yet', 'Mercedes', 'Benz', 'showroom', 'Suddenly', 'bomb', 'had', 'set', 'had', 'forgotten', 'about', '1987', 'explodes', 'event', 'past', 'back', 'lives', 'who', 'had', 'become', 'advertising', 'executive', 'lawyer', 'mother', 'society', 'girl', 'interaction', 'still', 'living', 'revolutionary', 'life', 'plain', 'latter', 'better', 'worse', 'are', 'stuck', 'past.This', 'movie', 'problems', 'one', 'thing', 'premise', 'not', 'terribly', 'original', 'theme', 'been', 'addressed', 'Additionally', 'so-called', 'revolutionaries', 'do', ""n't"", 'inspire', 'much', 'sympathy', 'How', 'exactly', 'did', 'people', 'want', 'improve', 'society', 'German', 'generation', ""'68"", 'was', 'rebelling', 'parents', 'particularly', 'fathers', 'what', 'precisely', 'was', 'cause', 'generation', ""'87"", 'why', 'set', 'leave', 'bomb', 'building', 'someone', 'might', 'enter', 'characters', 'come', 'across', 'more', 'as', 'spoiled', 'brats', 'people', 'who', 'really', 'wanted', 'change', 'world', 'better.The', 'film', 'various', 'action', 'sequences', 'involving', 'police', 'station', 'old', 'homemade', 'film', 'Overall', ""'d"", 'give', 'movie', 'three', 'stars', 'seeing', 'not', 'must-see', 'A', 'much', 'more', 'compelling', 'look', 'German', 'terrorists', 'lives', 'East', 'Germany', 'Volker', 'Schlondorff', 'Legend', 'Rita']",What to Do in Case of Fire
718920,APUHDIL2CEI3C,B00006JU6Y,Dr. Victor S. Alpher,"[8, 11]","It is the mid-1980s, and Berlin, Germany, is in chaos.  You're an anarchist.  Or, at least you think you are, and the hormones of your early 20s count for a great deal.  Up against the ""Imperialisten Schweine"" (Imperialist Pigs) in the form of Police with riot gear...throw a few cakes, a little urine from above...what's the harm, really?  Do a little squatting in an abandoned building?  All in good fun.Columbia Tri-Star makes it to Germany...and this is a funny, heartwarming film.  After all, friends just can't stop being friends, even if a pressure-cooker encased bomb does go off a little late--like, twelve years late. A little harm to a government bureaurat from Bonn, as Berlin prepares to take its rightful place as the Capitol of Germany again.  No big deal, really.This isn't the Baader-Meinhoff gang.  Their more fun, and probably much more attractive.  So it goes in the movies, na und?It just so happens they left behind a little incriminating evidence, including a film on how to make a bomb from common materials...and that film ends up in the police barracks at Templehof, in a building heralding from the time of the Third Reich.This film has a great deal of humanity, although you have to look for it beneath the glitzy, stereotyped images.  It is about friendship, betrayal, the biological imperatives, lost youth, money over love, and much more.  Thankfully, there's a bit of suspense, and no one is really hurt.Filmed in Berlin it was!  It is becoming a great city, again.The soundtrack is super!!! Jan Pliwa's music unfortunately is in German, so many will miss the ironies there, but much of the music is also in English, and a surprising number of Germans still learn English passionately, and these days, they learn American, not the Queen's English once taught in the Gymnasium (German High School for the professionally bound youth).The film was released for Region 0 with subtitles, rather than dubbed.  I generally think this is better for such films, and it definitely is here.  The translations are at times a bit weak, but don't detract from the humanistic content.It is hard to forget Machnowstra&szlig;e SO 36, even if they did use a differnt building.  The new owner, hot to get an invalid who lost his legs in the street wars of the 1980s, is well cast.  Klaus L&ouml;witsch, as the aging police detective who was on the trail of the Anarchists back in that time, who is assigned and then taken off the case...has the last laugh.  His empathy with this dispersed gang--all but two have become upper-middle class citizens, is palpable and genuine.  The ""new"" German police seem quite concerned with what will appear on the ""Abendschau"" or Evening News--quite refreshing.Highly recommended.  And the soundtrack, titled ""Was tun, wenn's brennt"" is also superlative.",5,"What You Didn't Know, Didn't Hurt You--Until....",1077408000,"02 22, 2004",2004,2802,"['mid-1980s', 'Berlin', 'Germany', 'chaos', ""'re"", 'anarchist', 'least', 'think', 'are', 'hormones', 'early', '20s', 'count', 'great', 'deal', 'Up', 'Imperialisten', 'Schweine', 'Imperialist', 'Pigs', 'form', 'Police', 'riot', 'gear', 'throw', 'few', 'cakes', 'little', 'urine', 'what', 'harm', 'really', 'Do', 'little', 'squatting', 'abandoned', 'building', 'good', 'fun.Columbia', 'Tri-Star', 'Germany', 'funny', 'heartwarming', 'film', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'being', 'friends', 'even', 'pressure-cooker', 'encased', 'bomb', 'go', 'off', 'little', 'late', 'twelve', 'years', 'late', 'little', 'harm', 'government', 'bureaurat', 'Bonn', 'Berlin', 'take', 'rightful', 'place', 'Capitol', 'Germany', 'again', 'No', 'big', 'deal', 'really.This', ""n't"", 'Baader-Meinhoff', 'gang', 'more', 'fun', 'probably', 'much', 'more', 'attractive', 'movies', 'just', 'so', 'left', 'behind', 'little', 'incriminating', 'evidence', 'including', 'film', 'how', 'make', 'bomb', 'common', 'materials', 'film', 'up', 'police', 'barracks', 'Templehof', 'building', 'heralding', 'time', 'Third', 'Reich.This', 'film', 'great', 'deal', 'humanity', 'have', 'look', 'glitzy', 'stereotyped', 'images', 'friendship', 'betrayal', 'biological', 'imperatives', 'lost', 'youth', 'money', 'love', 'much', 'more', 'Thankfully', 'bit', 'suspense', 'one', 'really', 'hurt.Filmed', 'Berlin', 'was', 'becoming', 'great', 'city', 'again.The', 'soundtrack', 'super', 'Jan', 'Pliwa', 'music', 'unfortunately', 'German', 'so', 'many', 'will', 'miss', 'ironies', 'there', 'much', 'music', 'also', 'English', 'surprising', 'number', 'Germans', 'still', 'learn', 'English', 'passionately', 'days', 'learn', 'American', 'not', 'Queen', 'English', 'once', 'taught', 'Gymnasium', 'German', 'High', 'School', 'professionally', 'youth', '.The', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'Region', '0', 'subtitles', 'rather', 'dubbed', 'generally', 'think', 'better', 'such', 'films', 'definitely', 'here', 'translations', 'are', 'times', 'bit', 'weak', 'do', ""n't"", 'detract', 'humanistic', 'content.It', 'hard', 'forget', 'Machnowstra', 'szlig', 'SO', '36', 'even', 'did', 'use', 'differnt', 'building', 'new', 'owner', 'hot', 'get', 'invalid', 'who', 'lost', 'legs', 'street', 'wars', '1980s', 'well', 'cast', 'Klaus', 'L', 'ouml', 'witsch', 'aging', 'police', 'detective', 'who', 'was', 'trail', 'Anarchists', 'back', 'time', 'who', 'assigned', 'then', 'taken', 'off', 'case', 'last', 'laugh', 'empathy', 'dispersed', 'gang', 'two', 'have', 'become', 'upper-middle', 'class', 'citizens', 'palpable', 'genuine', 'new', 'German', 'police', 'seem', 'quite', 'concerned', 'what', 'will', 'appear', 'Abendschau', 'Evening', 'News', 'quite', 'refreshing.Highly', 'recommended', 'soundtrack', 'titled', 'Was', 'tun', 'wenn', 'brennt', 'also', 'superlative']",What to Do in Case of Fire
718921,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B00006JU6Y,Linda Linguvic,"[2, 3]","The concept of this 2001 German film is intriguing.  It's about a group of six self-proclaimed anti-establishment anarchists in Berlin who, in the 1980s, set off bombs in protest against the establishment.  Fast-forward a dozen years, and two of them are living in squalor and still dreaming non-conformist dreams, one runs a successful ad agency, one is an attorney, one a mother of two young children and one is a socialite.  Their lives are suddenly changed forever however, when a bomb that they had planted twelve years before goes off and there is an investigation.  Good theme.The problem with this film, however, is that it can't seem to decide if it's a comedy, a social satire, or a drama about how time changes people.  It's filmed at a wildly fast pace and everyone is a caricature instead of a character.  It held my interest because I wanted to see how the plot would turn out, which was silly, contrived and predicable.  It was also mildly amusing as we get to know the characters and how they have changed.  Acting was good and so was the creative use of cinematography with flashbacks shown in distorted colors.  But I experienced neither laughter nor pathos nor interest even though I must admit that people who put this production together tried hard.",3,"Intriguing theme -- but silly, contrived and predictable.",1079654400,"03 19, 2004",2004,1270,"['concept', '2001', 'German', 'film', 'intriguing', 'group', 'six', 'self-proclaimed', 'anti-establishment', 'anarchists', 'Berlin', 'who', '1980s', 'set', 'off', 'bombs', 'protest', 'establishment', 'Fast-forward', 'dozen', 'years', 'two', 'are', 'living', 'squalor', 'still', 'dreaming', 'non-conformist', 'dreams', 'one', 'successful', 'ad', 'agency', 'one', 'attorney', 'one', 'mother', 'two', 'young', 'children', 'one', 'socialite', 'lives', 'are', 'suddenly', 'changed', 'forever', 'however', 'when', 'bomb', 'had', 'planted', 'twelve', 'years', 'off', 'investigation', 'Good', 'theme.The', 'problem', 'film', 'however', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'decide', 'comedy', 'social', 'satire', 'drama', 'how', 'time', 'people', 'filmed', 'wildly', 'fast', 'pace', 'everyone', 'caricature', 'instead', 'character', 'held', 'interest', 'wanted', 'see', 'how', 'plot', 'would', 'turn', 'out', 'was', 'silly', 'contrived', 'predicable', 'was', 'also', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'how', 'have', 'changed', 'Acting', 'was', 'good', 'so', 'was', 'creative', 'use', 'cinematography', 'flashbacks', 'shown', 'distorted', 'colors', 'experienced', 'laughter', 'pathos', 'interest', 'even', 'must', 'admit', 'people', 'who', 'put', 'production', 'together', 'tried', 'hard']",What to Do in Case of Fire

While the film revolves around six former German anarchists and one counter-counterculture cop, it's not trying to be prepossessing concerning the validity of anarchism, terrorism, or cultural revolution.  Instead, it is a simple look back at that period just beyond youth but before full adulthood when a person has the opportunity still to be idealistic, artistic, personally expressive, and openminded.  After that, the movie--and one of the former anarchists claims, &quot;the nesting instinct takes over,&quot; a feeling with which anyone approaching or just beyond their 30s will empathize.
