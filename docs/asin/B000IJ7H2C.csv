1021091,A11ZG7PKB6ZZZC,B000IJ7H2C,A. Anderson,"[32, 36]","I agree with the reviewer who said everyone interprets the book in a different way.  I've always been slightly irritated with the other versions that render one of the most passionate books so tame and mannerly.  Jane Eyre is not a Jane Austen novel.  It is over the top and gothic and melodramatic. Jane and Rochester are two passionate creatures in the book--they are always storming and raging and lightning is symobolically burning trees next to them--but in the movies they are so chaste.  I was thankfully surprised that in this one they are touchy-feely.  In the book, when he is trying to persuade her to stay with him, there is a lot of crushing her to him going on.  I'm glad they showed that in this version.  I really believed these two were in love, mentally, emotionally, and physically.I think it's funny that a couple people said they were too good looking but nobody mentions that the actress in the Timothy Dalton version looks about 38.  I never could believe it when she says she's 18.  And she has none of the impetuousness and rage that young Jane Eyre has.  I loved this one.  I thought she captured all the power and passion surging in Jane's soul.  And I like that she is cute to us but would have been considered ugly by Victorians.  That is how I always pictured Jane--as somebody who didn't live up to her age's standard of beauty, whereas Blanche is supposed to be the epitome of that ideal.I thought this version was more in the spirit of the book than any of the others (a spirit of passion and vehemence and rage).

1021096,A2N67WDLG0TL97,B000IJ7H2C,"A. Griffin ""aegriffin""","[39, 67]","The most blatant flaw with this production was the casting:  The handsome Toby Stephens (like the gorgeous Timothy Dalton in the earlier BBC production) is totally inappropriate because Bronte depicts Rochester as an ugly, Vulcan-like man of medium height.  (Also, Stephens' acting (he's not convincing as a man who has lived in empty misery for 15 years) is mediocre, so he's not credible on that score, either.)  In the novel Jane is a small woman with irregular features.  Ruth Wilson is a tall beauty.  One of the things Rochester and Jane understand about one another is how it feels to be considered ugly relative to the population at large.  As a couple, Wilson and Stephens would easily fit in at a Hollywood party.  Clearly the idolatry of the modern age influenced the director, who, given the BBC's reputation for quality television should have known better.  The cynical view is that Stephens' status as the son of renowned British actress Dame Maggie Smith influenced his casting.A lot of time was spent highlighting the romance scenes between Rochester and Jane, Celine and Rochester, St. John and Miss Oliver, and even Bertha and Rochester. I believe this was done to attract young women viewers who will love these scenes -- and buy the DVD.  We don't, however, see much of (1) Bronte's criticism of the Church (i.e., St. John's coldness of heart, and its inconsistency with Jesus' character, or Mr. Brocklehurst's cruelty), or (2) the persistence of good in an evil environment (as displayed in Bessie, Ms. Temple, Helen Burns), both major themes in the novel.  Clearly, commercial appeal won out over artistic quality and the author's intent.Though the production is not embarrassing (notwithstanding the acting of several characters is not of the caliber one expects in a BBC production), it is disappointing in its blatant refusal to honor the key features of the novel (i.e., ugly people can find love, too; hypocrisy and cruelty in the Church of England; child abuse; Christian duty to do right when life has been hard).  (Again, these themes won't sell DVDs.) The Sorcha Cusack/Michael Jayston production (1973) is the most faithful to the novel and an absolute delight to watch.

1021105,AAVLB0GGEKRCO,B000IJ7H2C,Andrew Raker,"[7, 11]","Note:I have now seen ALL the color adaptations of Jane Eyre. While I liked this adaptation better than the 1981 and 1996 adaptations - and about equally well as the 1997 A&E; adaption - I thought the film fell short of the 1973 or 1983 BBC adaptations.My primary problem with this film is that it seems to modernize the story. In other words, the language and mannerisms of the actors appear more 21st century than 19th century. Now, there are many examples of this. I will list a few.1.2006 adaptation has Rochester hire someone to play a fortune-telling gypsy. I believe the reasoning behind this is that it would appear more logical to a 21st century audience that is very critical of the supernatural. (i.e. 21st century viewer might say, how could Blanche NOT know the gypsy woman is Rochester!!) However, in the early 1800s, I think a man like Rochester could have pulled off dressing like a gypsy because of the religious superstition of that period.2.Blanche is kinder is this adaptation than the 1973 or 1983. I guess the 21st century young people would be amazed at the rudeness Blanche conveyed in the earlier adaptations. Therefore, the scriptwriters softened her image.3.In 1973,Michael Jayston presents a somewhat vulcan Rochester. Both the 1983 and 2006 adaptation make Rochester appear pretty. However, the 1983 DOES create a vulcan Rochester AFTER the fire at Thornfield. Therefore, in a way, they made up for his handsomeness before the accident. However, the 2006 just makes Rochester too handsome for the whole film.4.In Oliver Twist, the classic lines ""Please, sir, I want some more"" and ""It's more no than yes Bill"" are remembered. I could not imagine any credible adaptation revising these expressions to ""I would like to eat some more gruel"" or ""I do not want to go to court to see if Oliver is there."" Likewise, this adaptation changes many of the classic and memorable phrases from the novel. For example, Rochester calls Jane ""a witch"" rather than ""an elf,"" swears by using God instead of deuce (devil).Final Thoughts:Jane Eyre (1973) and (1983) are much more loyal to the original story-line. Because of this, it is possible that Masterpiece Theatre decided to change the story a little to appeal to viewers who wanted a change. I do not criticize the adaption nearly so much as I do the Oliver Twist (2007) BBC adaptation. However, I just personally feel that for me the 1973 and 1983 are better, more loyal productions.

1021106,A23KZBVCFKW1XS,B000IJ7H2C,A_Plain_Janeite,"[2, 4]","Truth be told, I didn't read the book until last year. To date I have seen 6 other ""Jane Eyre"" adaptations (4 movies & 2 miniseries).This adaptations screen writer is Sandy Welsh, who has written 2 of my favorite miniseries: ""North & South"" '04 (the Elizabeth Gaskell novel)- a 1st place tie between ""Pride & Prejudice"" '95, as being my most favorite period drama to date! And (Jane Austen's) ""Emma"" '09.So for me, she's set the bar quite high in her productions.Sadly, this miniseries pales in comparison to the faithfulness of the previous two BBC miniseries: 1973 & 1983.While the events are substantially in order, the dialogue is modernized (aka ""dumbed down"").The chemistry (or in this case, the overt portrayal of physical attraction) is believable enough, but I guess that's because it's pushed in the viewers face every few minutes. Sadly this is a misinterpretation of the story-- being Rochester & Jane are both described in less attractive terms; so their mutual attraction lies in their personality & intellectual connection.I felt this ""Rochester"" (Toby Stephens) lacked the complexity of the books character. His ""brooding"" lasts about 5-10 minutes, then he turns into a ridiculous lovesick whelp (but to be fair, part of the blame could lie in script, and direction). In the book, ""Rochester"" is very careful at concealing his true feelings until the proposal scene; not so with this.Ruth Wilson's portrayal of ""Jane"" was a fair bit better (likely in my top 3); although her appearance is much prettier than her book counterpart.The major things I didn't care for are (**SPOILER ALERT**):- Miss Temple was missing from Jane's extremely shortened and glossed over Lowood experience (something the other 2 mini's included); who was very much a guiding force, and savior for Jane!In fact, it was after Miss Temple married and left, that Jane decided to leave herself.- Instead of the game of charades in the book, they replaced it with the Victorian version of Ouija (which I skipped over).The charades scene was important, because one of them happened to depict Rochester & Miss Ingram being married (thus stirring a pang of emotion in Jane).- An actual Gypsy woman was hired by Rochester, instead of him dressing up and pretending to be one. A major cop-out if you ask me, being the other 2 miniseries faithfully portrayed this important scene.It's Rochester's rather unconventional (and somewhat comical) attempt at ascertaining her inner feelings towards him.- Rochester's plea for Jane to stay after the Bertha revelation, was seriously altered from the book, and sadly cheapened by spicing it up.That whole bed scene simply did not happen in the book; at this point Jane shunned Rochester's displays of affection!Again, refer to the '73 & '83 adaptations, if you want an accurate depiction!(I also think the 2011 movie captured this crucial scene much better, despite it being shortened.)- The glimpse of Bertha's licentious behavior after her marrying Rochester was utterly gratuitous, again, another ridiculous attempt at spicing the story up; a simple verbal explanation would have sufficed!In conclusion, I feel this miniseries had the potential to be so much better than it was. If you really desire an accurate depiction, look elsewhere ('73 or '83 miniseries, or the condensed 2011 movie).On the other hand, if you don't mind a modernized soaped up version of ""Jane Eyre"", then look no further!",3,"2 1/2 Stars: The Weakest ""Jane Eyre"" Miniseries To Date",1366934400,"04 26, 2013",2013,3420,"['Truth', 'be', 'told', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'last', 'year', 'date', 'have', 'seen', '6', 'other', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'adaptations', '4', 'movies', '2', 'miniseries', '.This', 'adaptations', 'screen', 'writer', 'Sandy', 'Welsh', 'who', 'written', '2', 'favorite', 'miniseries', 'North', 'South', ""'04"", 'Elizabeth', 'Gaskell', 'novel', '1st', 'place', 'tie', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', ""'95"", 'being', 'most', 'favorite', 'period', 'drama', 'date', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'Emma', ""'09.So"", 'set', 'bar', 'quite', 'high', 'productions.Sadly', 'miniseries', 'comparison', 'faithfulness', 'previous', 'two', 'BBC', 'miniseries', '1973', '1983.While', 'events', 'are', 'substantially', 'order', 'dialogue', 'modernized', 'dumbed', 'down', '.The', 'chemistry', 'case', 'overt', 'portrayal', 'physical', 'attraction', 'believable', 'enough', 'guess', 'pushed', 'viewers', 'face', 'few', 'minutes', 'Sadly', 'misinterpretation', 'story', 'being', 'Rochester', 'Jane', 'are', 'described', 'less', 'attractive', 'terms', 'mutual', 'attraction', 'lies', 'personality', 'intellectual', 'connection.I', 'felt', 'Rochester', 'Toby', 'Stephens', 'lacked', 'complexity', 'books', 'character', 'brooding', '5-10', 'minutes', 'then', 'ridiculous', 'lovesick', 'whelp', 'be', 'fair', 'part', 'blame', 'could', 'lie', 'script', 'direction', 'book', 'Rochester', 'very', 'careful', 'concealing', 'true', 'feelings', 'proposal', 'scene', 'not', 'this.Ruth', 'Wilson', 'portrayal', 'Jane', 'was', 'fair', 'bit', 'better', 'likely', 'top', '3', 'appearance', 'much', 'prettier', 'book', 'counterpart.The', 'major', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'are', '**SPOILER', 'ALERT**', 'Miss', 'Temple', 'was', 'missing', 'Jane', 'extremely', 'shortened', 'glossed', 'Lowood', 'experience', 'something', 'other', '2', 'mini', 'included', 'who', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'guiding', 'force', 'savior', 'Jane', 'fact', 'was', 'Miss', 'Temple', 'married', 'left', 'Jane', 'decided', 'leave', 'herself.-', 'Instead', 'game', 'charades', 'book', 'replaced', 'Victorian', 'version', 'Ouija', 'skipped', 'over', '.The', 'charades', 'scene', 'was', 'important', 'one', 'happened', 'depict', 'Rochester', 'Miss', 'Ingram', 'being', 'married', 'thus', 'stirring', 'pang', 'emotion', 'Jane', '.-', 'actual', 'Gypsy', 'woman', 'was', 'hired', 'Rochester', 'instead', 'dressing', 'up', 'pretending', 'be', 'one', 'major', 'cop-out', 'ask', 'being', 'other', '2', 'miniseries', 'faithfully', 'portrayed', 'important', 'scene.It', 'Rochester', 'rather', 'unconventional', 'somewhat', 'comical', 'attempt', 'ascertaining', 'inner', 'feelings', 'him.-', 'Rochester', 'plea', 'Jane', 'stay', 'Bertha', 'revelation', 'was', 'seriously', 'altered', 'book', 'sadly', 'cheapened', 'spicing', 'up.That', 'whole', 'bed', 'scene', 'simply', 'did', 'not', 'happen', 'book', 'point', 'Jane', 'shunned', 'Rochester', 'displays', 'affection', 'Again', 'refer', ""'73"", ""'83"", 'adaptations', 'want', 'accurate', 'depiction', 'also', 'think', '2011', 'movie', 'captured', 'crucial', 'scene', 'much', 'better', 'being', 'shortened', 'glimpse', 'Bertha', 'licentious', 'behavior', 'marrying', 'Rochester', 'was', 'utterly', 'gratuitous', 'again', 'ridiculous', 'attempt', 'spicing', 'story', 'up', 'simple', 'verbal', 'explanation', 'would', 'have', 'sufficed', 'conclusion', 'feel', 'miniseries', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'was', 'really', 'desire', 'accurate', 'depiction', 'look', 'elsewhere', ""'73"", 'miniseries', 'condensed', '2011', 'movie', '.On', 'other', 'hand', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'modernized', 'soaped', 'up', 'version', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'then', 'look', 'further']",N/A

Even Jane Eyre' s childhood is dealt with (quickly, I grant you, but dealt with nonetheless) in the film, her dreams and her terrible childhood with the Reeds first and then at Lowood school.I think no one better than Ruth Wilson could embody Jane Eyre with passion, sadness,  great strength and acuteness. She is perfect in the part but Toby Stephens as Mr Rochester is the one who really blow me away. His performance is simply fantastic and even if Mr Rochester is not my favourite character, I can't help being impressed by the actor's performance. He brings charm and humour to the dark, impassioned character.  He is definitely `thud-worthy' as C19 members would say! The two actors are supported by a superb casting, (Christina Cole performs very well the part of Blanche Ingram, Francesca Amis tends to annoy me a little but simply because she has the part of a cold, hateful character, Mrs Ingram, so in a way, Amis succeeds very well there, Lorraine Ashbourne, Andrew Buchan and the little Tara Fitzgerald are worth mentioning).The dialogues have been a little changed but they are still following the spirit of the book; They are simply mesmerizing and with the talent of the actors it is with deep interest that you listen to Jane Eyre and Mr Rochester's conversations and passionate scenes.The chemistry between the actors is the great force of this adaptation and there is such sexual tension between Jane Eyre and Rochester that some scenes really makes me blush... The photography is very good, the landscapes and the Derbyshire moors are spectacular (I was pretty excited to notice that they used Haddon Hall as the setting for Thornfield as I visited Haddon Hall and went to that part of Derbyshire not so long ago!)And I love the music as well (with oriental notes). But I love the outdoor scenes when there are some long pauses between the lead actors; These are delicious silences too!!!I can't find any flaws in this adaptation. It is perfect in every way even if, for me, it may not be as 'overwhelming' as North and South (screenplay written by the same person, Sandy Welsh) partly because I still prefer Thornton (Richard Armitage) to Rochester. In any case, it is probably one of the best period drama I've ever seen!!!",5,"`Jane, you and I, it is like we're a pair of Eshton's twins'",1175904000,"04 7, 2007",2007,2762,"['love', 'quote', 'metaphor', 'twin', 'birds', 'perfectly', 'beauty', 'depth', 'love', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'Rochester', 'love', 'magnified', 'two', 'charismatic', 'actors', 'Toby', 'Stephens', 'Ruth', 'Wilson.I', 'never', 'felt', 'particular', 'interest', 'love-story', 'now', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'brilliant', 'adaptation', 'even', 'want', 'read', 'book', 'again', 'pay', 'much', 'more', 'attention', 'love-story', 'rather', 'plain', 'intelligent', 'governess', 'master', 'Mr', 'Rochester', 'Even', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 's', 'childhood', 'dealt', 'quickly', 'grant', 'nonetheless', 'film', 'dreams', 'terrible', 'childhood', 'Reeds', 'first', 'then', 'Lowood', 'school.I', 'think', 'one', 'better', 'Ruth', 'Wilson', 'could', 'embody', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'passion', 'sadness', 'great', 'strength', 'acuteness', 'perfect', 'part', 'Toby', 'Stephens', 'Mr', 'Rochester', 'one', 'who', 'really', 'blow', 'away', 'performance', 'simply', 'fantastic', 'even', 'Mr', 'Rochester', 'not', 'favourite', 'character', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'being', 'impressed', 'actor', 'performance', 'charm', 'humour', 'dark', 'impassioned', 'character', 'definitely', 'thud-worthy', 'C19', 'members', 'would', 'say', 'two', 'actors', 'are', 'supported', 'superb', 'casting', 'Christina', 'Cole', 'very', 'well', 'part', 'Blanche', 'Ingram', 'Francesca', 'Amis', 'annoy', 'little', 'simply', 'part', 'cold', 'hateful', 'character', 'Mrs', 'Ingram', 'so', 'way', 'Amis', 'very', 'well', 'there', 'Lorraine', 'Ashbourne', 'Andrew', 'Buchan', 'little', 'Tara', 'Fitzgerald', 'are', 'worth', 'mentioning', '.The', 'dialogues', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'changed', 'are', 'still', 'following', 'spirit', 'book', 'are', 'simply', 'mesmerizing', 'talent', 'actors', 'deep', 'interest', 'listen', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'Mr', 'Rochester', 'conversations', 'passionate', 'scenes.The', 'chemistry', 'actors', 'great', 'force', 'adaptation', 'such', 'sexual', 'tension', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'Rochester', 'scenes', 'really', 'blush', 'photography', 'very', 'good', 'landscapes', 'Derbyshire', 'moors', 'are', 'spectacular', 'was', 'pretty', 'excited', 'notice', 'used', 'Haddon', 'Hall', 'setting', 'Thornfield', 'visited', 'Haddon', 'Hall', 'went', 'part', 'Derbyshire', 'not', 'so', 'long', 'ago', 'love', 'music', 'as', 'well', 'oriental', 'notes', 'love', 'outdoor', 'scenes', 'when', 'are', 'long', 'pauses', 'lead', 'actors', 'are', 'delicious', 'silences', 'too', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'flaws', 'adaptation', 'perfect', 'way', 'even', 'may', 'not', 'be', ""'overwhelming"", 'North', 'South', 'screenplay', 'written', 'same', 'person', 'Sandy', 'Welsh', 'partly', 'still', 'prefer', 'Thornton', 'Richard', 'Armitage', 'Rochester', 'case', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'period', 'drama', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen']",N/A

This one caught my eye and I am glad I watched it. Both the castle and location was incredible and the perfect atmosphere. The acting was incredible. BBC dramas always seem to have top notch actors and actresses and always finding new talents to keep things fresh. Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens had a believable chemistry for the story. He is older and brooding from his disappointing life and she is young, very self conscious, and sad. Somehow these two people so very different and opposites end up finding kindred spirits in each other. It was a coming of age for Jane but my attention was on how Edward Rochester changed and grew so very much himself. I was fascinated watching this very self absorbed, mistrusting, angry man slowly change and eventually allow himself to trust and love in another person with all his heart. For this very strong man to break down and beg Jane to stay throwing away his pride and arrogance really touched me. When he cried I believed him.This I will have to buy along with Pride and Prejudice (another favorite). Bravo BBC.

I'm truly sad to say this is just about the worst version of the nine, yes, nine adaptations.  The most faithful version remains the 1983 BBC production starring Timothy Dalton & Zelah Clark.The Masterpiece Theatre Jane Eyre misses Bronte's all important social commentary on the abuse & neglect of children, the status of women, and the Victorian view of mental health care.  Bronte tackled human rights head on:  her heroine is a, if not 'the' proto-feminist, her progressive hero a  humanitarian.  Sadly, the foundation of the novel is seriously diminished in the mini series with the first twelve chapters covering Jane's childhood are given the barest attention.(Circa 1850 women and children were regarded as property, women being thought to be biologically inferior.  Being a governess was to be a servant: after teaching was over for the day, a governess then took on menial labor, and at the end of long work day retired to a bed in the attic servants quarters.  Re. women & mental health issues, a male relative, notably a husband, could rid himself of the expense of a wife he didn't like byhaving her diagnosed with 'hysteria'.  She would then be removed to an institution such as the infamous Bedlam where she would find herself housed with the so-called 'insane' and 'mentally deficient'.  Beyond thechance of suffering physical assault by inmates, meager nutrition, unheated housing, the inmate's life wasshortened by poor sanitation leading to dysentary (24/7 diahrria), consumption (tuberculosis), etc..  Rochesters' placing Bertha under the care of a private nurse within his home is truly an extraordinary humanitarian act.  Final sidebar:  in 1850 England it was against the law to beat a horse but there was no lawagainst beating a woman).The casting is strange.  Ruth Wilson is far too tall to play Jane, and she looks vigorous enough to build Thornfield in the morning and plow fields in the afternoon. Toby Stephens' goofy Rochester is downright comic:  there are moments when you half expect him to do a Monty Python ""wink, wink, nod, nod"".  Togetherthey lack the chemistry necessary to meet the demands of one of English literature's most passionate couples.  When Wilson & Stevens touch, she touches his shirt with her hand but does not clasp his arm.

Good acting, but again, not a story that I loved and maybe I came in a bit prejudice because I feel like there could have been better chemistry and more of Mr. Rochester.  To that film's credit, though, it did make me more curious about other adaptations, and give me a bit of hope that I just may have failed to see the best version of this story out there.I am so glad that I gave this movie a chance!

This was so badly done that I was in shock after the first part shown on PBS's Masterpiece Theater, and felt compelled to watch the second half just to see if it could possibly get any worse.It did.

Yes, the story, the locales, and many of the characters are dark and gloomy but that doesn't mean viewers should need a candle to see the sets.  I kept wanting to give the actors flashlights so they wouldn't run into the furniture.  The acting was marginal--and I am very much a fan of Toby Stephens but he was not well cast here.

Even A&E;'s 2-hour version was better and they skimmed over quite a bit of detail  (Just goes to show what excellent acting can accomplish).Charlotte Bronte would be embarassed by this poor effort, as should the BBC be for doing ""Jane Eyre Lite"" for folks who don't want to read the book or care what it's really about.

1021114,AAGK7UK5BHSX4,B000IJ7H2C,"Born-Identity ""19973""","[21, 25]","I would give it 3 and 1/2 stars.  I was pleasantly surprised although I personally can't give it 5 stars for a number of reasons. I think those who have only seen the 2 hours versions and not the Dalton version and/or read the book will like it a lot. For most (not all) of those who've seen or read the latter they'll not be as overwhelmed.Because the Dalton/Clarke adaptation is closer to the book in atmosphere and dialogue, it truly epitomizes the Gothic romance and atmosphere of the book with the sexy, smouldering broodiness of Mr. Rochester, the soft-spoken introverted fairylike creature of the strong-minded Jane and the combination of the dark cloud of mystery hanging over Thornfield Hall and it's master.  For Masterpiece Theatre to cut out some of THEE most important parts of Mr. Rochester's introspective dialogue with Jane as she fell in love with the glimpse of the redemptive man she saw in the tortured soul, was a crime to say the least. It was so important to the story and there were so many hours in which to work with.You kind of know where things stand early on in this version.  If you like things to be a little more obvious as opposed to subtle, then this one is definitely for you!I felt Toby Stephens did a great job and he actually portrayed SOME type of emotion unlike Orson Welles, William Hurt and others who clung too strongly in my opinion to the angry/brooding side of Mr. Rochester.Mr. Rochester was a combination of moody, happy (with Jane), tumultuous and quietly introspective. Toby Stephens is never quite the ""peculiar"" Mr. Rochester that Mrs. Fairfax initally describes to Jane, nor is he the moody person Jane describes in the book as being one day kind to her, then unkind during some of their earlier meetings. This Mr. Rochester appears more lonely and sad, not necessarily brooding.For a friend, that I asked (more like begged) to watch because she had never read or watched Jane Eyre, this version (outside of the surprise of Bertha) left little surprise for her by way of their feelings because of the added scenes of his impatient treatment of Blanche Ingram and also the numerous scenes of he and Jane walking and talking alone out in the open as opposed to meeting in secret due to unforseen circumstances.  The proposal under the tree was very anti-climatic to her because of this. In the book/Dalton versions you are feeling Jane's anguish right up until the time he makes her finally open up and express her feelings for him.  Up until then you aren't sure if he is getting married or not.  When Jane struggles with him under the tree in this version, it's almost pointless as they already have pretty much let the other know their feelings due to their established companionship.I had to LAUGH OUT LOUD at this portrayal of Bertha.  The book had her practically running around on all fours like a beast with her hair a tangled mess (as did the Dalton version), but this version had a very lovely Bertha who had a temper tantrum at the end. No where near the look and lunacy portrayed in the book in order that you could truly sympathize with the plight of Mr. Rochester trying to find happiness in a plain governess who had a gentle spirit and light about her.I thought Ruth Wilson's acting was very good as she worked with the script she was given.  Her Jane called for Jane's outward expressions and actions to be far more assertive and impertinent than that of the time period and the book's Jane Eyre. For the most part, the book's Jane's inner thoughts were very passionate and not said aloud until the proposal scene, hence his painstaking attempts to draw her out.  With that said, she worked the adaptation she was given quite well.Also in this version, the gypsy scene appeared more as a simple joke played on all of the guests as opposed to what it truly was in the book and Dalton version - a plot by Mr. Rochester to draw out Jane's feelings for him in order to help her realize that outside of her stubborness and self-preservation, happiness was within her reach.  The dialogue in the book and Dalton scene spoke volumes as to how he truly recognized Jane's deeply conditioned thinking of being unworthy of happiness and reciprocated love.  It truly is an unforgettable scene due to the depth of the conversation and the humorous depths he sank to get into her head and have her express herself. The gypsy scene also was a way to expose Blanche Ingram for the ""mercenary""  she actually was. The book and Dalton's Mr. Rochester is much more of a scoundrel with a heart. This one already appears to be ""saved"" and not really seen as a scoundrel. He's more of a man whose had a few bad breaks and easily redeemable.Although as someone else alluded to, the physcial scenes are very harmless when generally speaking of Hollywood standards today, they are still SORELY misplaced in the Jane Eyre scheme of things.  The movie studios for some reason do not ""get"" there can be passion without laying on top of one another which would have never happened with the book's Jane character for the sake of righteousness and not flaming her own raging feelings. In that regard, I feel the studios do not have faith in their viewing audience to clearly see the underlying passions building up with looks and words exchanged between the two.  Can you imagine if the studios took such liberties with Pride and Prejudice and showed Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy doing that? Elizabeth was far more bold and assertive than Jane, yet they have Jane doing just that in this version while in a closed room, then outside on the lawn before marriage.  Jane Eyre? It would never happen... although the reader/viewer would know she'd wish it. Oh well.I guess the most positive thing I can say is the acting is top-notch and it's better than the other versions outside of the Dalton/Clarke adaptation - which still remains my favorite at this time.",4,The 2nd best version,1170115200,"01 30, 2007",2007,5887,"['would', 'give', '3', '1/2', 'stars', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'personally', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', '5', 'stars', 'number',

1021115,ASOT5NHUUHBBM,B000IJ7H2C,Boston Romance Reader,"[3, 5]","First of all Jane Eyre is maybe my favorite book of all time, it is one of my favorite books of the 1800s, I am a gothic lover. So I was pleased that it was being remade because I have been unsatisfied with the other versions. The best part of the movie is that it brings Jane and Rochester to life in the correct way, Jane is dowdy and plain and despite how superficial most movies and tv shows can be about looks, the costumes go out of their way to make the leads look as they should. My favorite performance was Tobby Stevens, Rochester can be tricky, he's a powerful controling man, who is also missing something that he desperatly wants and has given up on, I see the vulneblity in this portrayal, which is what makes the story. The actress who plays Jane is a close second, she is every bit Jane Eyre, and the only reason she is second to Stevens is that Jane is the easier character.The movie hits all the major scenes of the book, and does so with proper emotion and feeling. I believe the romance between Jane and Rochester and I feel the brokeness of each character and see the hope that they can be healed.  And yet, for some reason I was not totally blown away.  I think it is to do with the way the post wedding scenes were handled. In the book Jane's departure from Thornfield Hall was dramatic and heartwrenching, in the movie the wedding happens and suddenly she's on a rocky ledge. Those scenes eventually come, but by then she is out of danager and all emotional intensity is gone.",4,Best of the Rest,1304121600,"04 30, 2011",2011,1500,"['First', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'maybe', 'favorite', 'book', 'time', 'one', 'favorite', 'books', '1800s', 'am', 'gothic', 'lover', 'was', 'pleased', 'was', 'being', 'remade', 'have', 'been', 'unsatisfied', 'other', 'versions', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'Jane', 'Rochester', 'life', 'correct', 'way', 'Jane', 'dowdy', 'plain', 'how', 'superficial', 'most', 'movies', 'tv', 'shows', 'can', 'be', 'looks', 'costumes', 'go', 'way', 'make', 'leads', 'look', 'should', 'favorite', 'performance', 'was', 'Tobby', 'Stevens', 'Rochester', 'can', 'be', 'tricky', 'powerful', 'controling', 'man', 'who', 'also', 'missing', 'something', 'desperatly', 'given', 'up', 'see', 'vulneblity', 'portrayal', 'what', 'story', 'actress', 'who', 'Jane', 'close', 'second', 'bit', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'only', 'reason', 'second', 'Stevens', 'Jane', 'easier', 'character.The', 'movie', 'major', 'scenes', 'book', 'so', 'proper', 'emotion', 'feeling', 'believe', 'romance', 'Jane', 'Rochester', 'feel', 'brokeness', 'character', 'see', 'hope', 'can', 'be', 'healed', 'yet', 'reason', 'was', 'not', 'totally', 'blown', 'away', 'think', 'do', 'way', 'post', 'wedding', 'scenes', 'were', 'handled', 'book', 'Jane', 'departure', 'Thornfield', 'Hall', 'was', 'dramatic', 'heartwrenching', 'movie', 'wedding', 'suddenly', 'rocky', 'ledge', 'scenes', 'eventually', 'come', 'then', 'danager', 'emotional', 'intensity', 'gone']",N/A
1021116,A8Z0MJUYOC75E,B000IJ7H2C,Brenda McCreight,"[5, 6]","Like many Jane Eyre fans - and we seem to be a dedicated bunch - I was excited to see that Masterpiece Theatre had taken on this book. I was not disappointed, in fact, this was my favourite version so far. I thought Ruth Wilson really put enough heat into the role of Jane so that it wasn't a mystery why Rochester (also well acted) would find her appealing. I loved the way the settings were done and the pacing of their romance was just right. I liked it too, that finally, Wilson put some sexual heat into the story - I know Charlotte Bronte was constrained by the mores of her time, and I'm not one who reads current romance novels so that's not what I look for in this story - but let's face it - there had to be something more than interesting conversations to make Rochester willing to marry a penniless governess!I strong recommend this version over most others, including the new movie version.

That being said, this rendition comes a very close second. While there are differences in the plot and allowances made in manners of the time, I still really like and apprecaite the chemistry between the leads.  I know there have been some negative comments about the kissing in bed scene.  I gotta say it works for me!!! LOL  I know it wouldn't have been correct for the time, however, I believe physical/sexual attraction between a man and a woman is the same in most eras - even though it may not have been so portrayed. At any rate, I can appreciate the flashbacks; I particularly liked Ruth Wilson's portrayal of Jane's pure anquish at being torn away from the love of her life.  The playfulness/sparring between them was also well done.  The two character portrayals I did not like were Adele and Mrs. Fairfax.  They were pretty weak for me.  I was also pleasantly surprised at the guests.  The mother was a snide as the novel described.  I think the movie took some license with Mr. Echton's character. I don't remember him talking about two hearts having a spiritual connection but it does advance the plot.  Roby Stephens is way too handsome and sexy to ever be thought of as ugly.  In short, I really liked this rendition of Jane Eyre.

The more I watch successive editions of this novel over the years, the more I am annoyed with Rochester, finding him teasing and false, extremely self-centered and self-pitying and correspondingly heartless to others.  However, all of that are dominant parts of his persona initially, though he does grow through Jane's influence.  In this farce, the negatives are quite irksomely prominent, adding a whining tone, without the finer man element.  This Jane seemed to just wriggle all over for this insulting male attention, without the convincing evolution of seeing beyond the outer faults to inner qualities.  If that was even attempted to be portrayed, it certainly got lost somewhere in this modernization effort.The unhelpful departures weaken Jane (she breaks down and actually wails childishly and pathetically to him over her disappointed feelings at one point - NOT).  This effort sickeningly emphasizes Rochester's manipulative toying with her. When I saw the cover pictures of the actors, I thought they found a truly ugly Rochester, which he is supposed to be, but with redeeming character qualities.  Where were these?  Sorry, any fans of Stephens, but to me he needed the makeup to mitigate that gravely, pock marked face. It was not appropriate for Jane, though this cow certainly needed help.  Rochester is usually portrayed (more successfully) as a large man.  Instead, the miscast Jane here is actually the larger, more well nourished figure.  This Rochester is the one who looks under-nourished.  The thing is miscast throughout, including the mangy dog!There is a good laugh in here, the invented bed scene, disgusting between two unattractive persons for one thing.  Stephens works her over to her yielding pants, then proposes going away and living together as brother and sister. He avers he would not think of compromising her -- ""I wouldn't do that.""  Again, a laugh for its utter absurd contradiction and stupidity.  The thing was crude as well. Just another example of weakening and cheapening a classic, I guess so modern day viewers could relate or pay their money for the extra juice or some other boneheaded misfired non starter.Without being a strident purist, in final analysis, I honestly think the departures played against this version's authenticity even as a film.  They seemed to think they knew better, but I did not find it so.  Not a pleasing version to me at all for foundational reasons.  Actually, this attempt is another example of trying to update to modern day mores and customs. In my opinion and experience, these compromises always fail -- especially when dealing with a merited classical work.  They certainly failed here. Failed adaptation - failed movie.

I just have no criticisms (except- like every version- the St. John Rivers section is a bore- that's not this movie's fault- that's Charlotte's fault). I believe this was originally a Masterpiece Theatre mini-series. Here it is a 2-disc movie. It's just almost flawless. The mystery is beautifully presented- hints of it beginning from the moment Jane appears at Thornfield. The romance is handled so very well- the ambiguity of the way Rochester treats Jane, their long and strange and intimate talks, the growing kinship and the way in which the passion finally flares out- wow. The casting is sublime, the cinematography simply beautiful especially in the outdoor sequences set by the river. It's a wonderful version of a book that's difficult to film because it's so challenging to truly capture such a great book.

1021127,A1Z54EM24Y40LL,B000IJ7H2C,csm,"[12, 14]","Here in the United States, we have the NFL, Peyton Manning and his brother Eli as definitions of the alpha male species.  However, our cousins across the pond in England get to have Edward Rochester and Toby Stephens. Stephens gives the perfect alpha-male performance of Rochester in this movie by the BBC to the point that you cannot imagine EVER anyone else performing this role.  And, major newspaper reviewers said the same thing. After my husband saw it, he couldn't ever imagine George C. Scott in the role either (he said, ""Ewww, no way!"") - that's how much Stephens makes this role his own. It's a difficult thing to usurp performances of the same role by two MAJOR Hollywood actors but Stephens definitely does that in this movie with great ease.  Trying to imagine someone else perform the role after Stephens would be like enduring an American Idol contestant trying to perform ""Staying Alive"" by the Bee Gees or Elvis' ""Jailhouse Rock.""  Some performances stand alone throughout time, and Stephens' portrayal of Rochester in this film is definitely one of those performances.Here's something you probably wouldn't imagine from a movie like this. We live in a very golf and equestrian-oriented community and when Rochester rides in on that gorgeous black horse, dressed in black himself, well, a bunch of nine-year-old boys here just thought he was the consummate picture of cool!  If you're now shuddering at the thought of me allowing such young boys to watch this entire movie, well, that's what the fast forward button on the remote is for!  Besides, they didn't like any scene unless Rochester was in it and well, they OF COURSE think it's cool to watch Bertha burn the house down and jump off the roof.  Gotta be a boy, I guess!  But again, that's because of Stephens' ability to captivate an audience and pull them into the production.  Experienced theatre actors stand way above our Hollywood actors - these boys just couldn't turn away from this movie once they started watching it. Can you believe this? They want to read the book! Now to me, if I was an actor and could merit that kind of attention for a classic novel from such a young audience, I could retire with great happiness!  Can't wait until they have to read this book in high school and get to ruin the ending for the rest of the class!Keep this in mind too - this movie is now five years old and Amazon still runs out of stock on it, and people are still writing reviews for it!  I stumbled upon this movie one night on public television while Christmas shopping AND during a commercial (and it's a RARE thing that I even turn the television on).  Being thus distracted and with my back to the television, I hadn't realized the movie had come back on.  Before this movie, I had never seen Toby Stephens before in anything, but what made me turn around and watch was his voice. So much for Christmas shopping!  Since they delayed showing the second half to ""well, the next time Masterpiece Theatre is on, we'll show the rest,"" I went ahead and ordered it on Amazon since that is where I was anyway! I have since watched the thing so many times to try to get all the little innuendoes that are present.  If you watch it only once, you'll miss the whole thing - how Rochester not only falls for Jane, but teaches her what love truly is.  He pulls her along through this journey, and she as well, pulls him through his agonizing life to eventually find freedom in God.  The stuff that you can easily miss are things like Rochester rolling his eyes when the subject of governesses comes up, knowing that Jane is hearing every word.  He goes after her to see her response and then, finding her crying, sets out to get even.  He does it again when Lady Ingram demoralizes Jane to scum of the earth practically, and hires the gypsy to tell them things that are not so perfect about themselves (and to see if he's ""getting through"" to her).In addition, things like how heavy Rochester walks after he and Jane spend the night trying to save Bertha's brother after she tries to kill him, shoulders down, scuffing his feet along the pavement (something Rochester NEVER does - he walks tall and with strength), he looks as if the world is on his back. Not necessarily true to the book in EVERY aspect, this screenplay aptly portrays Rochester and Jane in a very human manner, but never misses a beat in describing how deeply they are rooted into each other.To my fellow purists out there, ""adapting"" a classic such as Jane Eyre is about as much fun as performing the Schirmer edition of Handel's Messiah instead of the one that Handel actually did himself, but don't pass by this movie.  There are quite a few liberties taken in this version, many of which I didn't quite understand as to why they were taken.  Many of Charlotte's beautiful prose was omitted and more ""modern"" texts were written.  Just a bit cheeky to do that in my humble opinion. You won't hear Rochester call her an imp or a fairy like in the book, - just accuses her of being a witch a scant amount of times, which takes away from that ""magical"" feeling that they both shared.In addition, Ms. Welch did change Mr. Eshton's character quite a bit, and interplayed it with the major theme of the story - how alike Rochester and Jane are and have become.  Instead of a politician, she made him a scientist.  He was studying twins and when Jane came back from seeing Aunt Reed, he looks at both Jane and Rochester and ""gets it"" - points out that they shouldn't be quite so doubtful of two people who can read each other's minds, even though they may be separated, miles in between.  This screenplay further develops the twin theme throughout the movie in such ways as Rochester appears out of nowhere whenever Jane arrives into a room; he's waiting for her when she comes back from Aunt Reed's (but not on a stile like in the book), and all of that ""magical"" prose that is included in that portion of the book is strangely omitted in favor of Eshton's take on their relationship.  Hmmmmm.In addition, I did have a quibble with what Rochester says to Jane at the end of the movie when he's wanting a wife. It was quite a bit disrespectful and needed to be encased with more verbage from the book to make it fly.  And, most of what Rochester says to Jane is completely omitted. There's just TOO many neat thngs going on at the end of the book to leave it out.  Although Rochester doesn't come out and actually ask Jane to marry him again in the movie (he does in the book), the part where he prays and asks God to help him lead a purer life would have definitely added to the end of this movie.  Also, the screenwriter has Rochester saying ""dark"" too much.  In light of his situation, ""bleak"" would have been a better description.Again, honestly, if you buy this video for nothing more than to hear Toby Stephens relay Rochester's escapades in France with Celine, you've done exceptionally well.  Never in the course of movie watching have I heard such an exceptional story teller!  It's kinda funnny really, when they pan back to Ruth Wilson's face - she's just as enthralled with his story-telling as the rest of us!  Sorry, my husband is a vocal music professor and I'm in the music biz so we're aurally oriented in this house - can't help noting talent when we see it!  Stephens is an easy choice for the role because it's one of the many characteristics of Rochester that Jane needs to get to the place where she gains her strength.Sorry for the long review but this movie is quite deep.  Be SURE you don't miss this one.  Don't pass it by thinking it's a stuffy movie that you cannot understand either.  When our cousins at the BBC pull together some of England's finest theatre actors, it's DEFINITELY NOT something to be missed.  I'm a bit aggravated though at the marketing of this video - the cover states, ""Just the right amount of heaving bodices.""  Really?  Why on earth does EVERYTHING have to be cheapened?  Especially if what is actually there you'll miss if you sneeze!  Masterpiece Theatre needs a new marketing staff.  Other than that, grab this DVD and treat yourself to Stephens' rich baritone voice resonating throughout Thornfield Hall. Great, great stuff - wish it was even longer.

1021136,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B000IJ7H2C,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[19, 23]","It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than ""Jane Eyre"" -- and it's harder to imagine a more perfect adaptation than this one.In fact, the 2006 adaptation has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, eerie direction, sensual romance, and a pair of magnificent leading actors. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre (Georgie Henley) was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school. But many years later, Jane (Ruth Wilson) moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into her employer, Mr. Rochester (Toby Stephens), a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat (Christina Cole).But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and a mysterious locked tower. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. And Jane must face losing the man she loves forever...I have to get this out of the way -- I love ""Jane Eyre,"" and have searched for a beautiful, FAITHFUL adaptation for ages. Well, this is it -- a gorgeous, powerful adaptation, which also sticks to the original novel. A few things are shortened or fleshed out, but overall it's not just faithful to the story -- it's faithful to the atmosphere.Director Susanna White doesn't get bogged down in billowy period clothes and wooden acting. Instead, we get the sensual, passionate side of the story, with lots of frustrated romance, sexual tension and a strong bond between two hearts. There are some more lighthearted moments -- wedding shopping, for example -- but also opulant, even dreamlike moments, such as the ""owl"" jump near the end.And she wraps it in some truly gorgeous visuals, usually in the classic gothic romance style -- looming dark halls, white-robed women, mysterious happenings in the night, misty moors and dark firelit rooms. The entire movie seems bathed in a pale luminous light, as if the sun never quite shines over Thornfield (and Jane and Rochester) until the very end of the story.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman. I spent most of the time fidgeting and wondering when Rochester was going to be back. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens are absolutely MADE for these roles. Wilson isn't really pretty, but she has a striking, luminous quality. And she's pretty brilliant at the passionate stuff (""You think that because I am poor, plain, obscure and little... that I have NO HEART!""), but just as good at the quiet moments.And Stephens looks worn and kind of tired for awhile, but he can be gloriously mercurial -- prickly, gruff, fiery and even mischievous.

The movie is visually stunning. The cinematography, is amazing. The acting between Edward Rochester (Toby Stephens) and Jane Eyre (Ruth Wilson) was very believable. I was convinced that Ruth Wilson was indeed Jane Eyre and that Toby Stephens was Edward Rochester. Their love came right at you and made you feel how much in love they were and the friendship they shared was also believable. Watching the movie you really get the sense that they are true soul mates and can't be separated from one another. Masterpiece Theater has followed the book very closely and that also adds to it being the best Jane Eyre movie to date. The only criticism I have is the casting of Adele, she looks way to old for the part of young Adele that's in the books and her acting was pretty bad.

Three things expecially distinguish this interpretation:  wonderful acting from the entire cast, particularly the spirited Jane (Ruth Wilson) and the tormented but appealing Rochester (Toby Stephens) (their attraction is totally believable!); outstanding production values and attention to period detail; and a script which misses none of the major plot points of the novel, but immediately engages the viewer by begining with Jane's arrival at Thornfield, and gradually revealing her early life as back story, rather than developing the tale chronologically.It should be noted that the film omits the explicit Protestant Christian aspects of the novel (and Jane's attendant prejudices), at least directly, while leaving intact Jane's defiantly independent sense of her own worth and her deep sense of what is due to other people.

It is one of those stories that you have to read in school, and while most, forgot about it and moved on to the next book, it stayed in my heart.The first time I saw the movie based on Jane Eyre, was on TV  with Joan Fontaine as Jane and the handsome Orson Welles as Rochester. I thought it a very accurate version of the book.Since then, there have been many a try at Jane Eyre - why? Because it is such a mystical quality to it, that it captures your fancy and you want to learn more and see more.Then I saw the repeat of the 2006 Masterpiece Theatre version starring Toby Stephens as Rochester and Ruth Wilson as the adult Jane Eyre.When I looked at Toby as Rochester, I forgot every other version I ever saw...He is THE BEST Rochester I have seen, with expressive eyes that tell of the pain and loneliness and hardships he has had.The only part of this new classic was they injected some occult games in it - Rochester had his guests play on an early form of a Ouija Board, and he has a gypsy come and tells all the guests' fortunes - including Jane. But Jane didn't fall for the gypsy knowing facts about her, and Rochester reveals himself to her.The interesting part about the occult, is the book DOES touch on it - as Rochester calls Jane through the miles - 'Jane - Jane Eyre' -She knows it's him and he is in trouble - ESP...This production is a new classic and has the best Rochester I have seen.Will never read the book without seeing Toby Stephens' face...Excellent!!",5,The best Rochester EVER!

The story of dramatic love that in the end overcomes all possible and impossible obstacles, tragic and dark secrets, sorrow, and regrets is modern and timeless, and the characters are alive, passionate, and very sympathetic.Of five TV and big screen ""Jane Eyre"" films I've seen, I liked the most two British TV films that follow the book closely. My favorite one is still after all these years the 1983 version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke. For many years, it had been the only version I saw, found it perfect, and did not think of watching the others ""Jane Eyre"" films. Two weeks ago, after re-watching Dalton/Clarke film yet again, I read about it on-line and was impressed to find out that the book has been adapted 18 times, and the artists as great as Orson Welles and George C. Scott among others have created the screen image of mysterious and charismatic Mr. Rochester. Famous for his classics adaptations director Franco Zeffirelli (his ""Romeo and Juliet"" is among my favorite movies) has directed 1996 version of ""Jane Eyre"" with William Hurt, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Anna Paquin, Geraldine Chaplin, and Joan Plowright.During the last two weeks, I've seen five ""Jane Eyre"" movies and it was a wonderful experience. There is something to admire in every adaptation of ""Jane Eyre"" even if not all of them are completely successful. The last film I saw was ""Jane Eyre"" (2006) TV-Series ""Masterpiece Theatre"" production directed by Susanna White with Toby Stephens, Ruth Wilson, and Francesca Annis as Lady Ingram. I admire this 228 minutes film for its devotion and loyalty to the book - it follows many plot lines faithfully and respectfully, and it very successful in creating the palpable real chemistry between two main characters which makes this film the most sensual of all yet incredibly romantic and delicate. I am very happy to admit that in case of Toby Stephens, the nature did not take a break - he is a talented actor with great screen presence. I first saw Toby in the James Bond movie ""Die Another Day"" (2002) where his was the most memorable performance as a world-dominating villain, Gustav Graves. In ""Jane Eyre"" he is marvelous as enigmatic, moody, and passionate Mr. Edward Rochester.4.5/5 or 9/10",4,"""...And then you smiled at me.

Maybe this was done intentionally to enhance the gloomy environment of her early years, but if so it was overdone in my opinion.  By the time Jane gets to Thornfield Hall the lighting improves, and is not a problem for the rest of the movie.I was surprised over the number of reviewers who criticize the choice of actors, saying both Jane Eyre as a young woman (Ruth Wilson) and Edward Rochester (Toby Stephens) were too good looking compared to how they are described in the book.  That is purely subjective, and I personally didn't find either of them particularly attractive.  Both actors did an excellent job of portraying individuals wounded by their past, and thus overly reserved (Jane) and morose (Rochester)...characteristics of often-perceived unattractive people.  As each begins to help heal the other's wounds, they become much more appealing and attractive at the same time, which is also true to life...even physically ""flawed or imperfect"" people become beautiful when they are happy.

1021156,AQ5NFBZYOHNQ6,B000IJ7H2C,"JB ""bookworm""","[132, 176]","Reading the numerous positive reviews of the 2006 television production of ""Jane Eyre"" one could be led to expect the definitive version of Charlotte Bront's classic novel. It is not. In fact, of all the six noteworthy adaptations which have been made of the novel since the Welles/Fontaine movie in 1944 this is by far the worst. And all the positive reviews must have been written by people who either do not know the novel, do not appreciate it or for whom a lavish production with stunning settings and two attractive leading actors is enough to send them into ecstasies. Admirers of the novel, however, and lovers of good period movies must cringe at this ""Jane Eyre"" (as they dare to call it).Although the length of this adaptation would allow for great faithfulness to the novel, many of the novel's most crucial scenes are either deleted, severely changed or replaced by scenes which have nothing whatever to do with the novel. The same goes for the language: The novel has become immortal for the unsurpassed beauty and originality of the dialogues between Rochester and Jane. In the 2006 version however, nearly all the novel's beautiful lines have been substituted with trite and stupid ones. And if this were not already bad enough, also the characters are portrayed in a way as to make you wonder if anybody of the cast and crew ever cared to read the novel. Whosever fault it may be, the actors', the scriptwriter's or the director's - but the fact is that Toby Stephens' Rochester and Ruth Wilson's Jane have nothing in common with the novel's main characters. Toby Stephens in particular does not resemble at all the charismatic, masterful, imperious, moody and irresistible Rochester of the novel. Where are Rochester's torment, his regrets about his past, his struggle with his conscience, and where is his wit? Played by Toby Stephens, the attractive, complex and three-dimensional character of the novel has become a one-dimensional weakling. Ruth Wilson tries her best, but neither does she physically fit the part of the small and elfin-like Jane, nor does the bold, self-confident and outspoken young female she portrays render the true character of the novel's shy and guarded heroine.Furthermore, instead of showing the subtle gradual development of the special relationship between the main characters - a love born out of the affinity of souls - the filmmakers just emphasize the sexual attraction between Rochester and Jane, thereby reducing one of the most complex and interesting love relationships in English literature to high school movie level. Apparently the filmmakers considered the emphasis on the sexual element as an appropriate means of modernizing the novel and securing the interest of a younger and supposedly shallow audience in the story.  And this is exactly the main offence of this production: Of course every director is perfectly free to adopt a novel according to his or her own notion, to change the plot, change the dialogues, change the characters and to call that film ""Jane Eyre"" - but to set that movie in the period of the 1850ies and to completely disregard that period's language and behaviour, etiquette and sense of decency is just plain bad movie making. This Jane Eyre is a silly soap opera in the disguise of a period movie in which the actors talk and behave as if they had been put in the costumes of the 1850ies by mistake. The most striking example of that is the scene after the aborted wedding - the novel's pivotal scene in which Jane won't allow even the slightest attempt of Rochester's caressing her. Considering what they did to the rest of the novel it should come as no surprise that this scene is completely butchered in the 2006 production. Rochester lies on top of Jane, they kiss repeatedly and seem both near to taking off their clothes. Not only is this an outrage to Charlotte Bront, it is also a complete misrepresentation of how people would behave in the middle of the 19th century.There have been many beautiful adaptations of famous novels in the last decade, which were true both to the literary models as well as to the period in which the novels play and which have charmed the audience without their having to be sexed up. The makers of the latest version of Jane Eyre unfortunately failed to recognize what is timeless in the novel and what is unchangeably bound to its time. This TV production is therefore a striking example of a senseless and totally superfluous attempt to modernize a classic novel. As a period drama it is a complete failure - as an adaptation of Jane Eyre it is a slap in the face of its author.If you simply want a better Jane Eyre you can take any of the other productions - if you want the definitive Jane Eyre there is only one to watch: the '83 BBC mini series with Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton. This Jane Eyre is in every respect the very opposite of the 2006 series. It has a brilliant script, the dialogues are straight from the novel and the plot is followed with the greatest possible accuracy. Moreover, it has two leading actors who truly capture the essence of the characters they portray. Timothy Dalton in particular is a revelation as Rochester. Like no other actor before him or after him he renders all the different facets of Rochester's character and does so to perfection. Zelah Clarke is equally excellent in the role of Jane in that she portrays exactly the Jane of the novel and does not try to make her bolder, more modern and more feminist than described by Charlotte Bront. The interplay between Clarke and Dalton is wonderful and they render all the passion and intensity of the novel without their having to fall back on the means of modern eroticism and without once digressing from the literary model. This superb production is and will remain the only true, the definitive ""Jane Eyre"".",1,An insult to Charlotte Bront,1194480000,"11 8, 2007",2007,5839,"['Reading', 'numerous', 'positive', 'reviews',

For one thing, Toby is very appealing as Rochester.  Perhaps a bit too good looking.  And, I always think Rochester should be much taller than Jane.  Maybe what we needed was a shorter Jane???  I always think of Jane as very short, very slender, almost too thin.  Ms Wilson is a bit too beefy but has the requisite plain/attractive face depending on her expression and the way she is being photographed.  She has a most unfortunate upper lip which gives her a little bit the look of a fish.  I think there are too many scenes of passionate love making between the two as it just doesn't seem to me to be something that would have happened.  After Jane finds out he is married, I think the chances of her lying on a bed with him making passionate love are pretty much slim to none as they say.  I wish they would have told the story straight forward instead of having her all of a sudden show up on the moor half dead then later switching back to what happened before that.  It might confuse some people.  There is never a good explanation of why Jane did not get in touch with her uncle as soon as she knew he existed.  That information just lies there till St. John shows up with the information he has found.  Other than the above, I liked the movie.

1021162,A2D9TA1EYXA9KR,B000IJ7H2C,"J. Kara Russell ""Actress/Artist/Musician/Writer""","[22, 46]","After her stunning and brilliant Direction of BLEAK HOUSE last season, Susanna White creates a visually stark and beautiful to look at version of JANE EYRE.  But this is not Bronte's Eyre... in fact it is one of the most mentally wrong versions I've seen. You'd need to go back to the 1930s early talkie version with Virginia Bruce to find a Rochester as simply wrong in every way as Toby Stephens is here.A lot of this problem is the script, which translates Rochester and Jane into the mental set of a two-timing husband trying to pick up a shy co-ed in a singles bar.  Just plain ikky.JANE EYRE is difficult to translate well onto screen because her major relationship in the book is NOT with Rochester, it is with God, it permeates her upbringing, her time at Rochester's house, her struggles, her time at the house of the Pastor & his sisters, her refusal of missionary work, and the end.  Bronte was a brilliant, incisive religious thinker who used this story to pinpoint that a relationship with God can be a reason to relieve yourself from mission work for the wrong reasons, just as it can be a drive to deny your heart's wish because that, too is wrong.Even if you take out bits of the story, you can retain this mindset.  When you remove this mindset, which THIS gloriously costumed, photographed, and settinged production does, you deteriorate the characters into ""Jane and Rochester Rock the Canopy Bed"".  That should have been the title of this one... so very WB network (or now CW network).This is my favorite book, & I've seen - several times - almost every version made of this story, and have a collection of it.  Not only do I not want this version, I could not make myself watch all of it - I kept turning it off and coming back.  I was disgusted by watching Jane and Rochester snog on the sofa and put down Miss Fairfax.So wrongheaded, Bronte must be spinning in her grave like a silkworm junkie that needs a fix.  JANE EYRE is the story of two physically unattrative people, drawn together by understanding of their souls.  There has not been ONE version yet that has cast BOTH roles this way, and I defy a major studio to do it.  (The closest was probably Zefferelli's version.)Ruth Wilson, tall, elegantly slender, not beautiful, but in every way attractive by today's standards, and Toby Stephens, the greasy-haired six-pack ab workout hottie, are both about as wrong as you can get physically.  The 40s version with Welles and Fontaine took tremendous liberties with the book and they're both attractive, but they both eminate the souls found in the book in a production that just reeks of the spirit.But the real corker here is the way Rochester is written and played. He might as well be mubbling his way through a Sam Sheppard play!  If you are seriously REVIEWING this DVD you HAVE to distinquish between lusting after Toby like pre-pubescent teens & Rochester the timeless character.  Good young actor, nice bod, completely wrong for Rochester.  Even Gorgous Timothy Dalton was better because he had the right mental stuff going on.)  Best Rochester ever is Ciarin Hinds in the version with Samatha Morton.  HE is still too tall, too handsome, but WOW.  100% got the book down.  (Morton, on the other hand, a fine actress, looks the part but sneers and smirks like a demi-monde courtesan... wierd, wierd choices.)So this missed effort - I gave it a 3 - Why so high?  The production values are that high.  Really, that detail correct, that beautiful to behold.  Which makes the sum of the parts that much more insufferably frustrating.

I was shocked that Jane's feisty, intelligent personality was completely ignored (except for the vague hint we get of it at the old tree).  While true to the book in some respects of the character such as being plain and simple, we never see this Jane intellectually spar with Rochester, we never see her call him on his self-serving interpretation of love and religion, we never see her draw him out of his pining, we didn't even get to hear her tell off Mrs. Reed Jane-style!!

I saw what aired on the BBC as ""Episode 3,"" the third hour, last October in Scotland and was on pins and needles waiting for Masterpiece Theater to bring Jane Eyre to my TV.  Jane's childhood seems to go by quickly, but her experiences and associations are never forgotten and this adaptation makes connections throughout.  Ruth Wilson's Jane is completely fresh and true.  She is on screen throughout and is always in character, her face always expressive.  Toby Stephens is also a powerful Rochester.  Yes, he's handsome!  But he brings more of Rochester's humor and intensity to the role than I've seen in other actors, and he is ""eyes-open,"" a Rochester whose past is never far from his mind -- very interesting.  The script ties in incidents beautifully and uses much of the text of the novel.  It is very clever.  There is a scene in the novel that is one of my favorites that is altered here but to me works better for purposes of this program:  Jane returns to Thornfield after attending Mrs. Reed -- in the novel she is overcome with emotion and tries to sneak past Rochester unseen.  This is used earlier in the dramatization, when she unexpectedly comes upon Rochester watching dragonflies on the grounds of Thornfield.  However, her speech (""Thank you for your great kindness"") on returning from Mrs. Reed's deathbed -- is used intact and in context.  Anyway -- it is a very good production in my opinion.  I have edited this review to add praise for the entire cast.  In particular, praise for Pam Ferris in giving Grace Poole depth.  The BBC website, in its section on this production of Jane Eyre, includes Grace Poole's story, written by Ms. Ferris.  The soundtrack is beautiful and brings me to tears!  I hope that we will someday have a CD of Rob Lane's soundtracks.  He also composed the soundtrack for ""To the Ends of the Earth.""Make note of the other reviews here!

I liked this movie and it's actors very much. The chemistry between Jane and Edward is dynamic, full of passion for each other with out over doing it.Toby Stevens brings a totally refreshing and different performance to Mr Rochester, not dark or wonderfully sardonic as Orson or Timothy or crazed as Ciaran Hinds or underplayed and boring as William Hurt. He is strong and masculine with out being mean and manic and creates a very sexy and passionate Rochester with the aire of tortured mystery to him. Ruth Wilson plays a wonderfully waifish, winsome and bewitchingly fairie like Jane, quiet and calm but full of inner strength, compassion and understanding... she brings a wonderful intelligence to this role that is warm and pleasing. She makes a perfect Jane. The whole feel to this movie was intriguing.The only part of the movie that really bothered me was the Gypsy scene... where in the book, Mr Rochester disguises himself and plays the gypsy to reading fortunes of all the single ladies, including Jane, when his intention was to make her ( Jane) jealous of Blanche Ingram and to draw her out more, to learn more of her.""In most of the films made of Jane Eyre this scene is skipped totally. The only version that ever totally captured the spirit and essence of the gypsy sequence was the Dalton BBC film of Jane Eyre in the early 80's.  in this newest production it totally misses the mark.

1021173,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000IJ7H2C,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[350, 364]","""Masterpiece Theater"" has long been a benchmark in bringing quality British TV to American viewers.  With a prestigious history, some legendary programs--including ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" and ""I, Claudius""--have found acclaim, awards, and international audiences.  Of late, ""Masterpiece Theater"" has been showcasing some ambitious literary adaptations with mixed results.  Last season's high point, and a must for any lover of film, was the flawless adaptation of Charles Dickens' ""Bleak House.""  A triumph in every regard, and featuring Emmy nominated turns by Charles Dance and Gillian Anderson, this program should be essential viewing for those that value literate, classy and wildly entertaining TV.  This season's offerings have included ""To The Ends Of The Earth"" (an adaptation of William Golding's seafaring trilogy--'Rites Of Passage,' 'Close Quarters' and 'Fire Down Below'), a robust new version of Charlotte Bronte's ""Jane Eyre,"" a reimagining of Bram Stoker's ""Dracula,"" and the swan song of Helen Mirren's Jane Tennison in ""Prime Suspect 7.""What can one say about ""Jane Eyre"" that hasn't been said before?  Being familiar with the novel and countless prior adaptations, I'll admit that I wasn't all that excited to revisit what I consider to be a very familiar tale.  However, I diligently sat down to watch the latest 2 part ""Masterpiece Theater"" production.  And, boy, am I ever glad that I did.  While there are some liberties taken with the source material, that's to be expected.  Anyone who envisions every adaptation of a novel to be a literal translation is denying the power of the film medium to create new and enduring art.  In fact, it often annoys me when people carp on how something is different in lieu of accepting the merits of the interpretation.  This ""Jane Eyre"" succeeds so well due to the credible romantic relationship, the intelligent screenplay, and the genuinely haunting quality of the central mystery.While this version breezes past Jane's difficult childhood, it effectively settles into the heart of the story--when Jane takes a position at Thornfield Hall.  Jane becomes fascinated by her new employer, Mr. Rochester.  The two interact believably, and as Jane gets past Rochester's gruff exterior and erratic mood swings--she starts to have feelings for the man.  Part One of this miniseries details the evolving, but chaste, relationship.  In addition, the mysterious goings-on at Thornfield are excellently depicted.  I was riveted by everything in this first part--particularly the intelligent banter between the two leads and the underlying sense of dread that exists in the manor.  Easily 5 stars, the first half of this miniseries is flawless.  In Part Two, physical romance blossoms and secrets are revealed in a very satisfying way.  However, as ""Jane"" fans know--there are still plenty of obstacles in the way of true love.  As the story wanders away from Thornfield, the program loses some of its momentum and its magic.  It's still a good adaptation--but when the leads are separated, it loses a bit of its spark.In case you haven't guessed, I was thoroughly impressed by Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens, as Jane and Rochester respectively.  Wilson is the perfect Jane--intelligent and appealing.  It's hard to imagine someone not falling in love with her, she's so sensible and caring.  Stephens does a terrific job, as well.  Playing the tortured Rochester, he is a trapped soul that's yearning, but unable, to escape.  While referred to in the dialogue as ugly (which he's not), it is also easy to see why this man would be a challenge for and an equal to Jane.  A wonderful combination, Wilson and Stephens make this ""Jane Eyre"" sing.  Even if you've fallen in love with other versions, there is a vital romanticism that distinguishes this lovely film.

Then I watched the 1970's version with Timothy Dalton - - that is when I realized that there was so much more to the story than what was in the William Hurt version.Nevertheless, I enjoyed this movie.

1021181,A28VE4C1TXPLOC,B000IJ7H2C,L. Delaney,"[4, 5]","Allow me to catch my breath because this version of Jane Eyre completely blew me away in the most fantastic way. When I was a teenager the 1996 version of Jane Eyre was one of my favorite films. When the Mia Wasikowska version came out I saw that one and thought it was quietly gorgeous and beautifully shot. Recently, I came across this version and immediately went out and bought it not quite sure if it was going to measure up. Oh, Goodness, I could not have been more off the mark in thinking that this version would be anything less than AMAZING. This is by far my favorite version.Through the many remakes of Jane Eyre most people know the story. I won't bore you with the plot details of which you are probably quite aware. Let's start with what is different about this version. The first thing I noticed is that not much time at all is given to Jane's childhood struggles. This may bother some people but I was actually okay with it. Very quickly the viewer is thrown into the meat of the story; Jane, her time at Thornfield Hall, and Mr. Rochester. That's what I wanted to see and get lost in and this version showered me with exactly what I wanted.The second thing I noticed was the strong chemistry between Jane and Mr. Rochester. Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens are perfect together. They are passionate, playful, and electric while still being somewhat restrained. Toby Stephens plays a Mr. Rochester who, though he is gruff and maybe a little mean at times, is also so obviously in love. The way he finds ways to be around Jane, whether to talk to her or simply be in the same room with her, made me swoon. He loves Jane and the viewer starts to see that he is doing things to try and figure out if Jane cares for him. The scene with the fortune teller shows just how much Rochester NEEDS to know if Jane loves him.Ruth Wilson is the best Jane Eyre I've yet to see. There's a stubborn fire underneath all of that quietness. While many might see her as plain I thought she had a serene beauty that came from inside. She banters with Mr. Rochester and doesn't let him intimidate her even when she doesn't understand his motives. Just like Rochester, Jane is so obviously in love but has no idea what Rochester feels. Part of her serenity and strength though is that she loves very quietly, and fully. A perfect example of how she loves is when she begins wearing the red cloth around her neck. It was subtle but very deep.The kiss(es). Oh, boy, the kisses just KILLED me and it was a beautiful death. Passion, passion, passion. This version has passion and it is grand. I saw it meantioned in another review that there is quite a bit of kissing and I wasn't sure how I would feel about that. It's done well and I would not love this version as much as I do if the affection was absent.All in all?

1021187,AN94YI3URSAII,B000IJ7H2C,Lostgirl,"[8, 11]","With the 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice the BBC set a new standard for literaty adaptations. Fortunately it's one that they've been able live up to, Most recently in this recent adaptation of Jane Eyre.Overall it's a highly recommended adaptation. Is it 100% true to the novel? No but  since that's not really what I look for in an adaptation. The question is, does it stand on it's own merits? Yes.Ruth Wilson is really likable as Jane Eyre and I think that she has a exciting career ahead of her. I look foreward to seeing what she does next. Her Jane is less plain than others are and probably less so than Bronte wrote the character. From the begining there's a sparkle in her eye. She's less repressed, and all the brains and spirit that are initially well hidden in Bront's Jane are bubbling just beneath the surface of Wilson's.  Likewise, Toby Stephen's Rochester is younger and better looking than I usually imagine the character. But his harshness is tempered with a wonderfully sardonic wit. He's a man who has had a difficult life but he looks back on it with a rueful sense of humor.Once or twice it seemed as if the filmmakers were trying to make the film ""sexy"" in unnecessary ways. At one point Jane saves Mr. Rochester's life. When he  thanks her, he asks to shake her hand. Instead he takes both her hands in both of his and moves in very close. I was truely expecting a make-out scene. It just seemed more Supermarket Checkout Line Romance, then Victorian Gothic Romance. It's a romantic story to begin with- no need to turn it into a bodice ripper. These scenes aren't needed but the chemistry between the leads makes them work.A few reviewers have critized the two leads for being too attractive, betraying the idea of the book. However that assumes that the book is about ugly people falling in love. It's not. It's about a woman growing and establishing herself in life without the benefit of money, social connections or an exceptional physical appearance. Jane Eyre had endured as a work of literature due to the romantic and at times suspensful nature of the plot, the strong sense of atmosphere, a sense of with and intelligence and above all an immensely likable heroine (despite or perhaps because of her lack of glamour) While it leaves out a few potions of the novel, this film preserves the important qualities.",5,The BBC Does it Again,1170288000,"02 1, 2007",2007,2351,"['1995', 'adaptation', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'BBC', 'set', 'new', 'standard', 'literaty', 'adaptations', 'one', ""'ve"", 'been', 'able', 'live', 'up', 'Most', 'recently', 'recent', 'adaptation', 'Jane', 'Eyre.Overall', 'highly', 'recommended', 'adaptation', '100', '%', 'true', 'novel', 'not', 'really', 'what', 'look', 'adaptation', 'question', 'stand', 'own', 'merits', 'Yes.Ruth', 'Wilson', 'really', 'likable', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'think', 'exciting', 'career', 'ahead', 'look', 'foreward', 'seeing', 'what', 'next', 'Jane', 'less', 'plain', 'others', 'are', 'probably', 'less', 'so', 'Bronte', 'wrote', 'character', 'begining', 'sparkle', 'eye', 'less', 'repressed', 'brains', 'spirit', 'are', 'initially', 'well', 'hidden', 'Bront', 'Jane', 'are', 'bubbling', 'just', 'surface', 'Wilson', 'Likewise', 'Toby', 'Stephen', 'Rochester', 'younger', 'better', 'looking', 'usually', 'imagine', 'character', 'harshness', 'tempered', 'wonderfully', 'sardonic', 'wit', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'difficult', 'life', 'back', 'rueful', 'sense', 'humor.Once', 'twice', 'seemed', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'trying', 'make', 'film', 'sexy', 'unnecessary', 'ways', 'one', 'point', 'Jane', 'Mr.', 'Rochester', 'life', 'When', 'shake', 'hand', 'Instead', 'hands', 'moves', 'very', 'close', 'was', 'truely', 'expecting', 'make-out', 'scene', 'just', 'seemed', 'more', 'Supermarket', 'Checkout', 'Line', 'Romance', 'then', 'Victorian', 'Gothic', 'Romance', 'romantic', 'story', 'begin', 'with-', 'need', 'turn', 'bodice', 'ripper', 'scenes', 'are', ""n't"", 'needed', 'chemistry', 'leads', 'work.A', 'few', 'reviewers', 'have', 'critized', 'two', 'leads', 'being', 'too', 'attractive', 'betraying', 'idea', 'book', 'However', 'book', 'ugly', 'people', 'falling', 'love', 'not', 'woman', 'growing', 'establishing', 'life', 'benefit', 'money', 'social', 'connections', 'exceptional', 'physical', 'appearance', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'had', 'endured', 'work', 'literature', 'due', 'romantic', 'times', 'suspensful', 'nature', 'plot', 'strong', 'sense', 'atmosphere', 'sense', 'intelligence', 'immensely', 'likable', 'heroine', 'perhaps', 'lack', 'glamour', 'out', 'few', 'potions', 'novel', 'film', 'important', 'qualities']",N/A

Since there is so many reviews done of JE, I'm not going to give one.I liked the casting of Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens as Jane and Rochester. They did a great job of portraying the characters and the chemistry between them alone keeps you riveted to your screen.Yes, I know Toby Stephens is far too handsome for this role but he captures Rochester's abrasive and mercurial temperament superbly. He is a tortured soul. You can sense his vulnerability and loneliness quite keenly at times.I enjoyed his interaction with Jane, in whom he sensed a kindered spirit. You can feel his passion, simmering just beneath the surface. He wants Jane badly but must keep her at arms length, (because of a dark secret revealed later on) and his frustration in failing to do so is so tangible.Ruth Wilson was perfect as Jane. Her passion and zest for life just simmers beneath her sombre and reserve exterior. Despite her harsh childhood she grows up sweet and kind.She's takes one look at Rochester and falls  for him. She sees through his abrasive manner, sees his inner pain and is captured by his wit, humour and vulnerability. She practically glows when she's with him.Her absolute love for Rochester makes you feel her pain when things fall apart.This is one series I know I will be watching repeatedly as it's a definite keeper, with its gorgeous outdoor scenery, wonderful costumes and perfect casting.My only gripe is, I wished they had sub-titled this series.

The story is of course so powerful that one cannot help but reading the book all over again after watching this version. It is easy to see why people love this book, the characters are very intense and real. While some may say that Toby Stephens is too handsome for the part, he makes up for it by making the character utterly real. In the book, the character is lovable, but has to be ""humanized"" a little to hold when put on screen, and Toby is a master at this. He is an utterly chamaleonic actor, you can see in the different stages of the story. Ruth Wilson is the perfect Jane Eyre, she makes you see the tenderness as well as the self determination of the character, which in my opinion, is quite difficult. There are things in the book that have to be ommitted in the film for logical reasons, for the book is a first person account, and the film is not. However, Ruth Wilson is so expressive that you do not feel the film is lacking in information. They are a truly awesome pair, I honestly feel that miss Bront would have been very satisfied with this version. It is very close to the spirit of the book, one of the best examples of Victorian literature, revolutionary and passionate. This is the story of two very real characters, flawed in many ways, who fall in love because they are ""suited"" to each other. In a way it is a triumph of the modern Victorian woman, who manages to tame a wild beast of a man, who in spite of being deceitful and selfish, proves to have a true heart.

1021193,A2X9AXCWH4MT4I,B000IJ7H2C,"Marcy G. ""MarcyG""","[35, 41]","I am a period drama aficionado and count ""North & South,"" ""Pride & Prejudice"" and ""Wives & Daughters"" among my top favorites. I was keenly awaiting this new version of Jane Eyre as I count the earlier version starring Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke as one of my favorite dramas.This ""Jane Eyre"" has notable differences to earlier versions and they are, in most cases, good differences.  The same attention to detail, care, fine locations, engaging storyline, and superb acting and production values that you would expect from the BBC are present this version of JE. The cast is led by Toby Stephens (a favorite since his ""Tenant of Wildfell Hall"" days) and newcomer Ruth Wilson. Most of us already know the story and I am pleased to report that the screenwriter has done a good job of staying true (in most cases) to the book.  The screenplay and locations lend to the gothic and atmospheric feel of this version, and there is some beautiful cinematography throughout.I quite like Toby Stephens as Rochester. He is very different from Timothy Dalton's (my favorite version) portrayal but is good all the same. I think perhaps I wish he (Toby) was a little more stern or a little more of a brooding presence. I always thought of Rochester as a brooding, mercurial hero in my mind since I read the book years ago, and this difference between the book Rochester and Toby's portrayal doesn't always mesh.  While watching I found myself wondering what it would've been like if Richard Armitage (from ""North & South"") had played Rochester instead!  Ruth Wilson is pitch perfect, on the other hand. Her Jane is both strong and intelligent, but vulnerable all the same.  Francesca Annis, Christina Cole, Tara Fitzgerald and Georgie Henley are quite good in their supporting roles.I suppose one thing that may set the purists on fire are some of the changes (call it ""modernizing"" the story?) made to this adaptation.  There is certainly more kissing and passion - only alluded to and not often seen in the book and earlier versions - no doubt to make it appeal to modern audiences.  Although I like some kissing here and there, I must admit that ""less is more"" in this case. This Rochester is also far more likeable and appealing than his predecessors - and in my heart I wish he was a little more complex.  I like this version - not love it - and because of this I will only give 4 stars.

1021197,A2YYY4TSC15HRU,B000IJ7H2C,Marva Hardage,"[3, 3]","This item has been on my wish list for awhile, but, being on a tight budget, I have yet to purchase it. (That will be rectified within days!) I've seen several versions of this classic (not all by any means), and I've read the book multiple times. Up until now, I have to say that my favorite production has been the Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clarke version. It is absolutely true to the book. Even the dialogue of that version goes verbatim to the book much of the time. But, in all honesty, I have to say that after recording this version on my DVR this weekend, it's become my clear favorite. While there are minor deviations from the book, the heart of the story still remains intact. And the minor deviations do give this version a fresher approach. What I most love about this version is the passion displayed between Jane and Rochester. Hollywood could certainly take some pointers here. There are no inappropriate scenes, there is no R-rated material, but it is certainly not lacking in passion. The scenes in the flashbacks of Jane and Rochester that precede her leaving after the failed wedding are steamy, yet tasteful. And who among us hasn't thought that such passion would have indeed been a part of their relationship? Both Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens (he is gorgeous) were well suited to their respective roles, and played them to the hilt. I especially like his somewhat dry wit, and the banter that the two exchange at times.As far as any negatives, since I've only seen this broadcast on Ovation I can't be sure if there is any material deleted. However, basing my comments on what I've seen, the only real negative comments I can make about this version are  1) The part of the story that centers around St. John and his sisters is much less detailed than in the Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clarke version. That's not necessarily a negative, but it is much more condensed in this version.2) If one hasn't read the book or is otherwise familiar with the story, there may be some questions about Rochester's injuries toward the end. There is only a brief description of what happened at Thornfield, and no explanation or scenes depicting how he sustained his injuries. It is, therefore, to be assumed I suppose by anyone who may not already be familiar with the details. This version also leaves the impression that he remains blind. That was somewhat disappointing.In this reveiwer's humble opinion, the pros far outnumber the cons for this version. On a final note, another huge plus for this version is the grandeur of the scenery and the beautiful, sometimes haunting musical score. Of course, one would expect both from Masterpiece Theatre and the BBC. As always, they delivered with full force on this excellently done timeless classic.Addendum:As I mentioned in my initial review, I had, at that time, only seen this on Ovation. I ordered the DVD, and have now watched it. As I suspected, there were some scenes deleted from the Ovation production as there almost always is on network TV in order to fit alloted time slots. The scenes that were deleted, however, while adding to the overall feel and grandeur of the production, were not critical to the storyline. But I feel the need to add a little to my review now that I have seen the DVD. While I still love this version and am most happy to have it as a part of my video collection, I do feel that it is lacking in some minor details that, for me, would have enhanced the production. I will preface this by stating that I am very much a 'detail person.' For me, I prefer to know the how and why and when of events and not to be left assuming. If you are not a detail person, then these things probably don't matter to you.1)After the fire in Rochester's bedroom where the wonderful romantic scene takes place he wraps his robe around her and tells her '..we agreed you'd never be cold again.' Okay, when did that conversation take place? 2)There is a scene which takes place the morning following the fire when Jane learnes that he has left to attend a house party. When Mrs. Fairfax comes to the table, Jane appears to have in her hand either a necklace or some memento, which she quickly puts in her pocket as if she doesn't wish Mrs. Fairfax to see it. What is it? And what are the details regarding it? 3)After the scream in the night when all the guests are alarmed and gather in the hall Rochester speaks to them, calming their fears, and then tells them to go back to bed. We see Jane wipe up the blood that dripped from his injured hand (we are not told how that happened) and then we see her waiting fully dressed in her bedroom. At his knock on the door, she answers 'I'm ready.' He obviously conveyed to her that he wished her assistance. But that is omitted. 4)Toward the end when Jane returns to Thornfield, the details are very sketchy as to what happened to Rochester regarding the fire. Nothing is mentioned of his injuries. Jane obviously doesn't even know he's blind until she sees him some distance away outside Ferndean. At no time is it mentioned that he can see at least a little. Yet during the scene at the end when she sits in his lap with her face very close to his, she asked, ""Can you see me?"" and he nods in the affirmative.Now, having read the book and seen other versions of the story on film, I know most of these details. But I'm sure there are some who have not read the book and are not familiar with the story at all. For me, if that were the case, there would be some unanswered questions regarding these details I've mentioned.Those, for me, are the negative aspects of this production. Maybe I'm just spoiled by the Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clarke version, which is so detailed. Having stated all this, I do still love this version. I like the fact that Rochester seems to have a fondness for Adele, even though he says he doesn't like children. It is also obvious in this version that he does not care for either Blanche or her snobbish family and attitudes. He never states in this version that he offered his attentions to her in order to make Jane as madly in love with him as he was with her, which he does state in the book.Rochester is a wounded soul. The sadness definitely comes through. He comes across as a complex character; gentlemanly and refined, displaying at times a somewhat dry wit. Yet at other times one can see the intense sadness that masks his face.My initial rating of this production still stands. I love it in spite of the omissions, although I would very much have liked for those things I've mentioned to have been addressed.If someone out there is not familiar with the story and this is the first version you are to view, I would suggest you familiarize yourself somewhat with the overall aspects of the story, especially regarding Rochester's injuries and how they were sustained at the end.",5,"Lacking minor deatils, but at last!

Jane Eyre is one of my favorite novels and I am a great fan of period adaptations so I've seen my fair share of versions of this novel and many others. For me, this is the best adaptation of Jane Eyre made to date and I wouldn't be surprised if it remained that way. Toby Stephens is an excellent Mr. Rochester and I think captures all of his many complicated sides - his abrasive manner, his inner pain and turmoil, and his humor and wit. Too many version in my opinion portray him as dark and brooding only. While this is an essential part of his character - there is much more to him - there is an appeal, a vulnerability, and a passion that is just as important. And the same can be said for Ruth Wilson as Jane. She too brilliantly combines Jane's reserve and somber character while imbuing her with an adventurous and passionate spirit that come through in her subtle sparkle and sweetness that are captivating.I think what makes this version the best is that you really get a sense of the chemistry between Mr. Rochester and Jane - you feel it from the very beginning as they seem to do. I also like that this version incorporates the sensuality and the electricity between them rather than shying away from it.Altogether it is so well done.

It seemed like they were all too dark but this one is full of light and I liked Mr. Rochester. If you don't go by the book then you will love this version too! There a couple of inappropriate scenes in this movie that make it NOT for the family!,5,My favorite version...,1196467200,"12 1, 2007",2007,322,"['had', 'up', 'point', 'not', 'really', 'liked', 'adaptations', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'seemed', 'were', 'too', 'dark', 'one', 'full', 'light', 'liked', 'Mr.', 'Rochester', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'book', 'then', 'will', 'love', 'version', 'too', 'couple', 'inappropriate', 'scenes', 'movie', 'make', 'NOT', 'family']",N/A
1021207,A3CG1936WHZGYK,B000IJ7H2C,MJG,"[16, 21]","I have already written a review on this site advocating readers/lovers of Bronte's novel who want a FAITHFUL version of Jane Eyre to buy the Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clarke version as it is (especially with deleted scenes restored to the DVD version, making it truly a complete filmed version of the novel) the MOST true to Bronte's book in casting/acting, scenes played out, etc.  However, while I wasn't wild about this version the first time viewing it, I did enjoy it much better the second time through, having taped it off Masterpiece Theatre.  I think that Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson did a fine acting job, though, as others have stated here, he doesn't truly physically fit Rochester, and he also doesn't seem to have some of the edginess/hysteria that Dalton portrayed so well in the scene when Jane leaves him.  That scene, shown in a flashback in this version, has Stephens and Wilson steamily smooching on a bed - her lips are saying 'no' while simultaneously saying 'yes.'  This, to me, while very romantic and, probably in the director/screenwriter's choice, meant to show that Jane's temptation was great not to leave him and to become his mistress (which clearly WAS Rochester's intention in the novel, no matter the silly line inserted in this version that he would live with her as 'brother and sister' - something clearly NOT intended by the Rochester of Bronte's creation), the book clearly states that Jane will NOT kiss the 'husband of Bertha Mason' and Zelah Clarke very well shows how she had to steel herself against Rochester's attempts to break her down with kisses - though NOT in the bedroom.  No self respecting person in that day and age, especially someone who cared for their respectability and who would want to find employment again in a respectable household, would have dared to let a man who was not their husband alone in their bedroom.  This fact alone 'compromised' men and women into marriage proposals, whether things happened or not.  (Or have none of you EVER read Regency fiction?)  Even as recently as the 1940s and 50s, it was common for women in gals-only hotels to have to leave their apartment doors open when having a male friend visit - if they were unmarried.  These social mores were clearly stronger and more evident in Bronte's day.  Since Jane now KNEW that Rochester was NOT free to marry her, she would not have dared, divorce being almost unheard of in that day, to allow him into her room alone after she was enlightened about the existence of Bertha.  In the novel, her steeling herself and making herself appear 'cold' to Rochester is the only way she can preserve her own sanity and self from giving into the temptation of his suggestion to run away with him to become his mistress.  She tells him that everything is changed, and that she must change too - and that she loves him, when he desperately pleads with her that she never did truly love him, but that that was the last time she would be able to say it.  I reread that scene in the book after watching this version again the second time and the Clarke/Dalton version got it right - Dalton clearly shows the wildness and desperation Rochester is going through while Clarke shows Jane's steely determination not to give in.  I find it much more heartbreaking in that version, the parting scene, following as it does, Bronte's novel, than this more modernized version.There were also quite a few liberties taken with the speech in the novel - the Dalton version remains the most faithful in this department as well.  For me, the best parts of this version where when they kept to the words as written by Bronte.  I also did not care for the occult game played by the guests in Rochester's house - this was also not in the book and would have been abhorrent to Bronte's puritanical upbringing - and it was too bad that the director would not allow Toby Stephens to try his hand at playing the gypsy as Dalton did, which is what Rochester did in the book, rather than having a real gypsy brought in. Helen Burns and her important influence on Jane's outlook and character are also reduced to almost nothing.  I don't know if this is because many people at large have an antipathy to Christianity, but the part of the book where Jane describes her hunger for human love being so bad that she would endure things such as having an animal kick her or her arm broken, etc. countered by Helen's calm, wise advice on not putting too much emphasis on human love in this life, but rather focusing on the love of God - this to me seems to be a crucial scene when seen in light of Jane's drawing upon her spiritual resources to find the strength to reject Rochester's proposal to run away with him.  I found it sad that the screenwriter could not have considered at least inserting some part of that aspect of Jane and Helen's relationship in the film.All that being stated, there were touches in this film that I thought were nice - Jane's clear forgiveness of the unforgivable Aunt Reed was nicely portrayed and written, though again, not quite true to the description in the book, by Ruth Wilson, showing her generosity of heart.  Stephens' acting during the Rochester blind scenes was especially sensitive and heartfelt. I also liked that this version kept all three of Jane's cousins, though it would have been nice to have a St. John Rivers that truly was blond with the 'grecian profile' which the actor, while good, who played him, did not have either that Or was better looking than Toby Stephens, something which really should be considered in casting St. John Rivers.  His physique and face is part of the reason why Miss Oliver is so obsessed with him!  Again, the guy in the Dalton version who portrayed Rivers was much better cast - both in looks (as what was 'beautiful' in those days) and also in his portrayal of Rivers' hardness of heart and determination.  I thought it was a nice touch to show Jane and Rochester's 'happy ending' with their family together for the portrait at the end.  Most versions either just leave it to the viewer's imagination or just show them sitting together sedately by some water while quoting Jane's comments on Rochester gaining back his sight by the time their first born comes into the world so that he can see his son has inherited his large brilliant eyes.That all being said, while Dalton's version still remains my favorite, this one has beautiful cinematography and has the spirit of the book and has done a nice job with some of the backstory with Rochester and Bertha, making it probably the second best version in recent years - though for me, Orson Welles and George C. Scott approach Rochester's true physical outward appearance than some of the more handsome actors that have played him recently.  Ciaran Hinds comes closest of the recent ones, but his voice doesn't have the 'rich baritone' described of Rochester in the book.  Too bad NONE Of the versions ever showed Rochester and Blanche Ingram singing together.  I will still love Dalton's first, Orson Welles second, and probably this third of all the versions that have been made.",4,a good film BASED on the book,1173052800,"03 5, 2007",2007,7108,"['have',

I have seen the 1944, 1973, and 1983 film versions, and read the novel numerous times.  The 2006 version is the winner by a mile, for the following reasons: 1. The acting and casting is superb in every instance. 2. This is the first film ""Jane"" that looks and acts 18, as well as the first Mr. Rochester that was the right age (according to the novel, ""just past youth"", late 30's.) 3.  Filmed entirely on location, complete authenticity in that respect.  4. The first film version where I could believe the costumes. 5.""Adele"" looked French (although the actress was not), she also spoke French perfectly, and her character was portrayed more fully than in other versions. 5. The best presentation of the most important plot points of the novel i.e. good screenplay.  The written word and a film are 2 totally different media.  Film is primarily visual.  This was not a word-for-word reading from the novel, but a skillfull transfer to the visual medium, true to the situations and intense relationships portrayed in the novel.  6. The only film version that not only acknowledges but affirms the Christian content found in the novel.One flaw, small to the point of insignificance; Blanche Ingram, in the novel, has black hair and dark eyes, not blonde and blue-eyed, as in the film. But the main point is established still, Blanche's beauty, arrogance, and shallowness are portrayed well.In summary, for the above reasons, this film works!

All films based on masterpieces have the Sisyphian challenge of collecting the vapors of imagination into one mass, giving it form, and moving it against reality.The power of this story is derived from the steadfast integrity of its heroine: To emerge as noble as she does binds us inexorably to her plight. Jane is one of English literature's great characters.The years at Lowood School are given short shrift in all of the filmed versions, but not in the book. Jane's relationship with Helen Burns, Miss Temple and books is pivotal to her salvation from her days with Mrs. Reed, her miscreants, and Brocklehurst and Co. Brocklehurst is finally vilified, but not before he facilitates Helen's death from consumption. This occupies a quarter of the novel. Why is this spiritual-intellectual-tragic foundation universally truncated on film?One of the crucial scenes is the one in which Rochester proposes. Compare all of the versions with this touchstone. The Welles-Fontaine version is ridiculous. The Dalton-Clarke scene is austere and passionless. The Jayson-Cusack energy is cold and stilted. The Scott-York proposal is not credible. The Hinds-Morton is well acted but strangely awkward. The Hurt-Gainsbourg rendition is good, but bitter. This Stephens-Wilson interpretation is convincing and powerful. Wilson's Jane is the most polished of the collection of plain-(and not so plain)-Janes: Her basic integrity the most richly developed and convincing. Wilson, Gainsbourg, and Morton are the most accomplished thespians to date. Clarke, Cusack, and York never disappear into the 1830s. Fontaine looks as though she wafted out of an opium den. Virginia Bruce's Jane is a joke.All of the masters of Thornfield go wanting in one way or another. Fault the script and direction, not their acting skills. Most are consummate actors. In none of the pairings has the string from Edward's rib to Jane's seemed genuine.The ""Just the right amount of heaving bodies"" on the marquee, in this BBC production, is embarrassing and inappropriate, as are the bedroom antics. Too bad one cannot edit DVDs as one could VHS tapes. Excise the 21st century from the 19th.Still, after picking scabs off of all of the versions, this heals with the least scar tissue.The denouement is appropriate (a bit contrived), not awkward or abrupt as in the book and the other productions.All of the nine films have their individual strong and weak points. With multiple viewings, one tends to amalgamate the strengths of all to fashion a satisfying whole. It would be wonderful to have, finally, one definitive whole.Alas, this is the most engaging of the lot. It wears very well under the scrutiny of multiple viewings. Wilson's skills are impressively subtle. Examine the scene in which St John confronts Jane with her true identity. Watch her breathing whilst she remains expressionless.

It's not for anyone accustomed to the gifted authors who are *masters* of language, that have dominated American cable in recent years. In that respect it's oddly out of it's time. Which is a shame because the camera work and overall production values are great and Ruth Wilson is terrific; heartfelt and sympathetic... but that's about as far as it goes. Which isn't her fault.  She is hampered by shoddy writing and comparatively light weight conflict.Somewhere along the line, someone got the bright idea that Stephens -- who does an awful lot of smirking and frowning here -- should play Rochester like he never really means the coarse  . . . no, actually Bront's coarseness is largely removed from this version . . . maybe *objectionable* is a better word . . yeah *objectionable,* things he's says, almost apologizing for them. Signaling to the audience, not to be alarmed, this really is a romantic, good-guy.But that's only partly true.In Bront's  book, Rochester is a manic, indulged, game playing, liar. Sure he's *really* besotted with the governess, and has a looney wife in the tower, all of which creates a lot of stress. But how many men would play out their sexual/romantic pursuit in this twisted, convoluted way?  His eccentricities, changeable moods and ethical elasticity are also part of his *character,* and provide much of the dark, quirky menace and mystery that drive the story. Both for us and for Jane.  The reasons *why*, can never be completely answered.It seems this last point did not sit well with writer Sandy Welch, who sets about scrubbing away any trace of dirt and ambiguity from Edward's character, by creating scenes so ham-fisted, it's virtually impossible to imagine Bront wrote them. Example: a haughty house guest accuses him of too much compassion., explaining *she's* not bothered by the fact that some people are born rich and others poor. To which Rochester frowns disapprovingly, and declares the conversation tiresome.  In fact, at the point we meet Rochester he's long abandoned philanthropic notions in favor of dallying in ""sensual pleasure,"" (a conversation absent in this version.) He even calls Jane out for calling him on it. But even if you decide Rochester has since become more politically correct (Welsh's assertion not Bront's), is it wise to pointedly cue in the audience at this stage in the story? To a similar effect, Welsh invents a Ouija board scene where Rochester manipulates the board so Blanche spells out the word ""h-e-a-r-t-l-e-s-s.""And what she *doesn't* invent is not much better. In this version, Rochester hires a gypsy to play the fortune teller.  Upon discovery, he flat-out tells Jane, he just wanted to know what she was thinking, then they both make fun of the house guests.  Why bother contriving all that, if he had no problem spilling the beans anyway? Then after coming off a wonderful moment of indignance at being prompted to ""talk nonsense,"" Wilson's Jane must now appear dense, unable to decipher Edward's obvious adoration of her.And nowhere in *any* of this, is there any seeming awareness that only a perverse mind would engage in such play to begin with.And so on... his relationship with Adele is handled much the same way.The results are an Edward so sanitized and transparent, it seriously reduces the conflict and character contrast in the story, flattening the dynamic. We're also left with a much less interesting character, if not a confusing one.  And without the risk, his contrast to St. John Rivers, and the meaning of Jane's decision to return to Thornfield, is oversimplified.There's also far less testing of the waters, during the 1st interviews, and toe-to-toe challenge which is not incidental to the story.  In fact it's the hinge on which their relationship builds and an important facet that makes *these* characters unique.I will admit the proposal scene (one of the best in this version) had a lot of life to it and Stephens was at his best here. But at points even the changed dialogue landed awkward, and after building to the kiss, he lands one . . . right at the *side* of her mouth.As others mentioned, the Gateshead-Lowood years are inexplicably truncated. Though artfully done they are unsubstantial in providing the grim context. This includes child abuse in the shape of beatings, humiliation, unfounded accusations and a relentless barrage of damning judgment, aimed at breaking the spirit of orphaned youths . . . in the guise of saving their souls. At times Wilson's gravitas compensate for these deficiencies, but that can only stretch so far.This adaptation is also light on stricture -- either her adherence to or questioning of it, as well as her consuming struggle with conscience; her attempts to weigh what she has been taught, against what she is learning.And please no purist finger pointing, I firmly believe one can create too faithful an adaptation of a 500 page novel. But in the end you have to at least make choices that are consistent with the tone, along with other components that define a story.Otherwise cliches are used to punch up the romantic angle, such as back lighting during the ""after the fire"" scene, creating dreamy silhouettes that are more evocative of the sweet discoveries in ""Romeo and Juliet,"" than the dangerous sexuality in ""Jane Eyre.""Elsewhere in this version St. John, upon discovering the exhausted Jane, *gracefully* stretched out on a rock, simply lifts her up and carries her to safety.The '83 adaptation (which I discovered only recently) on the other hand, though flawed, does not omit the dirty bits. There, after weakened, dejected Jane (Zelah Clarke) tries to trade her gloves for a-day-old biscuit; she is shamed and thrown out of the bakery. She winds up shoveling gruel into her mouth, meant for pigs, with her bare fingers. Then starved, frozen and delirious, she bangs on a door during a storm.  In tears she yells incoherently at the housekeeper, who turns her away. After which St. John finds her.There is nothing graceful or visually appealing about *this* picture. The consequences are clear. Jane has fallen a lot further down  through knowing Mr. Rochester, the man she pledged her heart to.Pluses against minuses, I'd recommend the '83 adaptation. Be warned the production values are weak, the occasional scoring abominable, the camera work unimaginative and a few scenes needed to be reworked, even after good starts (but ONLY a few.)  Likely due to time constraints and/or momentary directorial assy-ness. Which is forgivable. This one probably had the lowest budget per hour.Still THAT one, which DOES use much of Bront's  gutsier language, tells THIS particular story much better. Timothy Dalton is walking thunder and provides an edgy pulse that is decidedly Bront. However while giving a bigger performance, he is overall, less mannered, and seemingly more relaxed in the vagaries of Edward's skin. He relishes the games, embracing the darkness and duality of this character, rather than apologizing for it. Yet his tender moments are both real and surprising, and genuinely rewarding.Given that the BBC/MT has, in recent years, produced gritty works involving female protagonists like, ""The Virgin Queen"" and ""The Final Act,"" without flinching, this bloodless, patronizing, girly-girl treatment of ""Eyre"" is puzzling and very disappointing. Next time they feel the itch to give Bront the Austen treatment, I hope they'll come to their senses and hand the project over to HBO, where they're under no obligation to tamper with essentials. Call me a cynic but I think economic  concerns trumped artistic ones, due to an avalanche of competitors jockeying for airtime and dvd sales.",3,Lighter Than Eyre,1183507200,"07 4,

Ruth Wilson is fantastic as Jane and captures her quiet yet resolute spirit very well.  Toby Stephens is a little too good looking for this version of Rochester, but I liked that they chose someone who was not middle aged.  People married so much younger during their time, that I think it's highly likely Rochester could be in his mid-to-late thirties instead of being portrayed as a much older man just because he is twice older than Jane's 18 years of age.  I also liked that the screenwriters decided to include some of the more mischievous and playful spirit of Rochester's character from the book this time instead of portraying him as simply a dark brooding, Byronic hero of Victorian literature.There were some liberties taken with the text where scenes were played differently than they are in the book, and the language was modernized at times.  However, the screenwriters still captured the spirit of Charlotte Bronte's book well, here.  One of my favorite things about this adaptation is that they actually included the scene with the gypsy - which most adaptations completely leave out.  I also believe that there was finally a fair portrayal of Bertha Mason and the background story of Rochester's history in Jamaica and his struggle to keep the family fortunes intact...All in all, it may not be a perfect adaptation, but the acting is wonderful.  Ruth Wilson is, in my book, hands-down the best Jane.  I just wish they had dwelled a little more on her upbringing at Lowood School so that those who aren't familiar with the book could understand more about the evolution of Jane's determined character.  Still, I highly recommend this version to anyone who is a Jane Eyre fan or even for someone who doesn't know the story.  Also, if you read the book first, you will get so much more out of it!

I also love the Orson Welles and George C. Scott versions.  The most horrible version of all is the one with William Hurt -- a case of very bad casting!  As much as I love Ciaran Hinds, that version was just plain awful -- all he did was run around and yell at the top of his lungs.  I have always loved Toby Stephens in everything he's done but I was very doubtful of him as Rochester and doubtful of yet another version of one of my favorite novels.  It's been done so many times and after the disappointment with the Ciaran Hinds/Samantha Morton version just a few years ago, I had no hopes at all.  Boy was I surprised!  It's not perfect and Stephens doesn't knock Dalton from his pedestal but he's a terrific #2 -- this was very good entertainment.  Lovely music and Stephens is very compelling.  Ruth Wilson is ok - she grows on you as the story progresses.  And there were some fascinating little differences - the flashback scene to Jamaica and Bertha's room being a little less dungeon-like, and the nice little ending.  I know the ""sexing up"" of the novel won't go down well with purists (the way the 1995 Colin Firth version of Pride & Prejudice appalled purists) but who cares?

I then read the book, for the first time, and realized how they totally chopped up the book with many inaccuracies. I still love the movie because I do think they got the perfect casting. Ruth Wilson is a great Jane eyre and I absolutely Love toby stephens as Rochester. I've only seen one other version of Jane Eyre and that's the Timothy Dalton version. While I thought that he portrayed Rochester well, Clark was a horrible choice for jane Eyre. She was mousy and hardly passionate like Ruth Wilson.Now, that being said, I did not like that they COMPLETELY chopped up the entire story in so many places that I was actually astonished when I read the book. I still will own the BBC version when it comes out in may, but I really, really wished they would have made the movie more accurate with this cast, because then it would have been absolutely AMAZING and no other Jane Eyre's would ever have to be made!Some of the inaccuracies are:1.Bessie is not the one to tell her of her Aunt's wish to see her before she dies, John is2. Blanche is not blond, but brunette3. The Love scene in the garden was shown in a meadow in daylight, not with the giant tree at night,(totally a disappointment and anticlimatic)4. St. John did not find her on some cliff or crag, but at his door in the rain. (they totally left out all scenes of her starvation and begging)5. They brought in a Gypsy to read the fortunes, when the book is plain that it's Rochester who is disguised like a gypsy.These are only a few of the discrepancies and they add so much other stuff that is not even hinted at in the story that it really makes it seem like a completely different version of the book was written.Even so, It is a great movie in itself and the casting is wonderfulI would love to see the 2 main characters in another version with more accuracy.Some have complained of the gloomy nature of the film, but I think that it is spectacular.

1021247,A446PJ96JQX4X,B000IJ7H2C,Sonya@Hollywood,"[3, 4]","""Jane Eyre"" was published in 1847.  Almost two hundred years and countless television and film adaptations later, people are still talking about Jane Eyre. Why?  Because author Charlotte Bronte knocked it out of the park with an unconventional heroine  and an enormously interesting and complex Mr. Rochester. The story still stands up today! I have seen many excellent adaptations including A & E's 1997 version with wonderful Ciaran Hinds and the amazing Samantha Morton.  Fans of ""Jane Eyre"" all have their favorite adaptations.  But this 2006 ""Jane Eyre"" four part BBC miniseries is quite simply a masterpiece! Aside from the beautiful cinematography, lovely period costumes, ""Masterpiece Theatre: Jane Eyre"" has assembled an incredibly good cast, including Tara Fitzgerald as the heartless Mrs. Reed.  But it is actress Ruth Wilson who is absolutely perfect as Jane.  Her subtle performance down to her facial expressions and underlying restraint kidnaps the viewer's sensibilities, until you suffer and pine right along with her.  Coupled with handsome Toby Stephens who gives a dark, interesting,and probably the sexiest Mr. Rochester portrayal I've ever seen, this ""Jane Eyre"" version is worth the entire four hours!! it's so good, I thought I had gone back in time. The only scene I questioned was between Jane and Mr. Rochester the night before she decides to leave Thornhill.  Both appear in rather intimate embraces. But as repressed passionate characters who are truly in love with each other, it's not a stretch to accept Jane  in Mr. Rochester's room or that his holding her tightly for dear life is an act of desperation, sensing he is going to lose her.  Of course, there are several fantastic scenes, like the proposal. The scene photographed as a long shot looks like a gorgeous countryside postcard as the two main characters run from the rain.  Jane and Mr. Rochester sitting by the pond  after she returns to Thornhill is especially fun and flirtatious. They have not seen or heard from each other in a very long time.  Their conversation initially brief and impersonal becomes charged as Jane teases Mr. Rochester and incites him in a jealous outburst. The viewer knows Jane and Mr. Rochester still love each other deeply and is rewarded.  I highly recommend ""Masterpiece Theatre: Jane Eyre.""

1021248,A10PC6OX6CEHZV,B000IJ7H2C,Steve W.,"[3, 4]","I've discovered in the very recent years the popularity of classic novels being adapted to extended TV presentations.  This has been going on for a long time, but I've arrived late to the party.  The online reviews such as are here on amazon are helpful to me when deciding which version to purchase first.  I went with the older Timothy Dalton production, and I like it very much.  I try to read the novels just before watching, just to have the written story fresh in my mind.  I have the patience for the longer, more complete productions.  That older title is very faithful to all stages of Jane Eyre's life story, and devotes film time to her childhood ""abuse"" before she grows up and takes command of her life.I next decided to try this newer production (Ruth Wilson as Jane), based on generally popular approval in reviews.  I agree with them.  I very much enjoyed it, and in most ways now prefer it over the earlier version I mentioned above.  Very little time is devoted to Jane's school girl story.  I think that time is important to understanding her character, and I wish there was more of it included in the film.  But I agree that the essential story is the romantic relationship between Jane (the governess) and Rochester (the employer/mystery).  And the romance is convincing in this version.  The actors are appealing physically, and they seem to have a real chemistry.  Neither are exactly beautiful, yet both are imperfectly beautiful.There's so much to the story, in novel form, that it isn't practical to expect it all to be included in this film.  The gothic mystery, with the secret in the tower room, is certainly represented with some significance.  But it seemed to me to slightly minimized in comparison to the book, or the Dalton mini-series.  I liked the way the gypsy woman scene was adapted this time.  It's more believable than the novel.  No man in woman's costume this time.  The quiet devastation of the marriage altar scene is well done.  The actress Wilson is convincing with her silence.  And when she does break down into tears, both in her scene with Rochester when he's about to propose, and when she's alone in her room with her wedding clothes, it's very moving.The book tests your endurance by taking Jane to a completely new location, with new characters, in the final section when she flees Thornfield Hall.  Here she starts over, and has time to reflect on the disappointment.  This film does include this period, and generally I like the way it's done.  I like the character St. John as it's written and acted.  In the book, I was always slightly impatient with him.  We're supposed to like his two sisters, and it's easy to like them.  In this film, I like them very much.  I wish more time could have been devoted to them here.  They were very important to Jane (book) and they make you feel good about people generally.  The inheritance story line wasn't emphasized as strongly as I would have liked, but it's there.  I like the way they included the local girl for St. John.  She generates my sympathy.The final reunion is satisfying.  Some parts are written differently, and it moves pretty quickly.  But the couple's love is well represented, as well as the sense of reconstructed family love.  As a film, standing alone from any famous novel, I thought it was very well done...very satisfying.",4,romantic theme comes across very well,1391040000,"01 30, 2014",2014,3348,"[""'ve"", 'discovered', 'very', 'recent', 'years', 'popularity', 'classic', 'novels', 'being', 'adapted', 'extended', 'TV', 'presentations', 'been', 'going', 'long', 'time', ""'ve"", 'arrived', 'late', 'party', 'online', 'reviews', 'such', 'are', 'here', 'amazon', 'are', 'helpful', 'when', 'deciding', 'version', 'purchase', 'first', 'went', 'older', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'production', 'like', 'very', 'much', 'try', 'read', 'novels', 'just', 'watching', 'just', 'have', 'written', 'story', 'fresh', 'mind', 'have', 'patience', 'longer', 'more', 'complete', 'productions', 'older', 'title', 'very', 'faithful', 'stages', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'life', 'story', 'film', 'time', 'childhood', 'abuse', 'up', 'command', 'life.I', 'next', 'decided', 'try', 'newer', 'production', 'Ruth', 'Wilson', 'Jane', 'based', 'generally', 'popular', 'approval', 'reviews', 'agree', 'very', 'much', 'most', 'ways', 'now', 'prefer', 'earlier', 'version', 'mentioned', 'above', 'Very', 'little', 'time', 'devoted', 'Jane', 'school', 'girl', 'story', 'think', 'time', 'important', 'understanding', 'character', 'wish', 'was', 'more', 'included', 'film', 'agree', 'essential', 'story', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'Jane', 'governess', 'Rochester', 'employer/mystery', 'romance', 'convincing', 'version', 'actors', 'are', 'appealing', 'physically', 'seem', 'have', 'real', 'chemistry', 'are', 'exactly', 'beautiful', 'yet', 'are', 'imperfectly', 'so', 'much', 'story', 'novel', 'form', ""n't"", 'practical', 'expect', 'be', 'included', 'film', 'gothic', 'mystery', 'secret', 'tower', 'room', 'certainly', 'represented', 'significance', 'seemed', 'slightly', 'minimized', 'comparison', 'book', 'Dalton', 'mini-series', 'liked', 'way', 'gypsy', 'woman', 'scene', 'was', 'adapted', 'time', 'more', 'believable', 'novel', 'man', 'woman', 'costume', 'time', 'quiet', 'devastation', 'marriage', 'altar', 'scene', 'well', 'done', 'actress', 'Wilson', 'convincing', 'silence', 'when', 'break', 'down', 'tears', 'scene', 'Rochester', 'when', 'propose', 'when', 'alone', 'room', 'wedding', 'clothes', 'very', 'moving.The', 'book', 'tests', 'endurance', 'taking', 'Jane', 'completely', 'new', 'location', 'new', 'characters', 'final', 'section', 'when', 'Thornfield', 'Hall', 'Here', 'time', 'reflect', 'disappointment', 'film', 'include', 'period', 'generally', 'like', 'way', 'done', 'character', 'St.', 'John', 'written', 'acted', 'book', 'was', 'always', 'slightly', 'impatient', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'like', 'two', 'sisters', 'easy', 'like', 'film', 'like', 'very', 'much', 'wish', 'more', 'time', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'devoted', 'here', 'were', 'very', 'important', 'Jane', 'book', 'make', 'feel', 'good', 'people', 'generally', 'inheritance', 'story', 'line', 'was', ""n't"", 'emphasized', 'as', 'strongly', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'there', 'way', 'included', 'local', 'girl', 'St.', 'John', 'sympathy.The', 'final', 'reunion', 'satisfying', 'parts', 'are', 'written', 'differently', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'couple', 'love', 'well', 'represented', 'as', 'well', 'sense', 'reconstructed', 'family', 'love', 'film', 'standing', 'alone', 'famous', 'novel', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'very', 'satisfying']",N/A

I have 3 other versions of the story which I think are much better.  Seeing this one, I couldn't help but feel that the actors were acting as if they were acting.  They didn't seem real.  Rochester wasn't too bad, but Jane was quite stiff, it seemed to me.  She is such a quiet, rather timid soul, most of her deep emotions have to show through her facial expressions, her eyes, which many times were tepid.  When she looked at her employer, there was no affection in her eyes, only coldness (until he expressed his love for her).  If you love someone, it is only natural that it show through your eyes, no matter how hard you may try to conceal it.  Other reviewers may disagree with me.  That's life.  I too am on an Eyre-a-thon.  I do this with Jane Austen's tales as well.

1021250,A2ZHH7AK83JB5G,B000IJ7H2C,"Susan K. Schoonover ""Sue Yingling""","[12, 20]","This adaptation of JANE EYRE is adequate and certainly  romantic enough to cause  teenagers and romance novel devotees to swoon  and it may be to appeal to those very viewers that some unnecessary changes were made from the book.  I did like Ruth Wilson's portrayal of Jane since she looks young, intelligent and attractive but not conventionally pretty though contrary to the book she is not ""little"" but as tall as her rather short miniseries love interest. This version's  Rochester is very handsome, charming and more likable then the melancholy, moody physically ugly man Jane falls in love with in the novel. In fact the most glaring change from the book  is  Rochester seems too socially popular and well adjusted to fall passionately in love with this young girl and risk society's disapproval to have her.  He also seems way too normal to keep his nutty wife locked in the attic while entertaining guests and courting a prospective bride on the lower floors but then again that rather implausible plot line  is true to Bronte's text.Much of Bronte's beautiful language in speeches between Jane and Rochester has been ""dumbed"" down (or modernized) though the original language for the most part is not inaccessible to the average Masterpiece Theatre viewer.  And Jane's religious convictions and the mores of the 19th century are not explored at all.  It seems inexplicable to this modern viewer that our rather plain, poor, previously unloved Jane would leave this rich, charming, hunk and a life of being adored to wander impoverished and friendless around on the moors.  The Rochester of Bronte's novel was a little scary and even dangerous and there was always more than a hint that if Jane stayed with him she might end up abandoned and disgraced making her choice in leaving him much more understandable.Though somewhat rushed I do like the scenes of Jane's childhood and her time with the Rivers family and the proposal from St. John is also given fair coverage.  I did not like all the twin imagery or Rochester's passion for nature which were pure invention for this version.  And small point that it is I don't understand why the filmmakers had to have a blond Blanche Ingram when there are many beautiful black haired actresses who would have fit the novel's description much better.Still any Jane Eyre is better than no Jane Eyre and despite its flaws this is an enjoyable and entertaining production.",4,Good Adaptation that  could have been so much better,1170547200,"02 4, 2007",2007,2421,"['adaptation', 'JANE', 'EYRE', 'adequate', 'certainly', 'romantic', 'enough', 'cause', 'teenagers', 'romance', 'novel', 'devotees', 'swoon', 'may', 'be', 'appeal', 'very', 'viewers', 'unnecessary', 'changes', 'were', 'made', 'book', 'did', 'Ruth', 'Wilson', 'portrayal', 'Jane', 'young', 'intelligent', 'attractive', 'not', 'conventionally', 'pretty', 'contrary', 'book', 'not', 'little', 'as', 'tall', 'rather', 'short', 'miniseries', 'love', 'interest', 'version', 'Rochester', 'very', 'handsome', 'charming', 'more', 'likable', 'then', 'melancholy', 'moody', 'physically', 'ugly', 'man', 'Jane', 'love', 'novel', 'fact', 'most', 'glaring', 'change', 'book', 'Rochester', 'too', 'socially', 'popular', 'well', 'adjusted', 'fall', 'passionately', 'love', 'young', 'girl', 'risk', 'society', 'disapproval', 'have', 'also', 'way', 'too', 'normal', 'keep', 'nutty', 'wife', 'locked', 'attic', 'entertaining', 'guests', 'courting', 'prospective', 'bride', 'lower', 'floors', 'then', 'again', 'rather', 'implausible', 'plot', 'line', 'true', 'Bronte', 'text.Much', 'Bronte', 'beautiful', 'language', 'speeches', 'Jane', 'Rochester', 'been', 'dumbed', 'down', 'modernized', 'original', 'language', 'most', 'part', 'not', 'inaccessible', 'average', 'Masterpiece', 'Theatre', 'viewer', 'Jane', 'religious', 'convictions', 'mores', '19th', 'century', 'are', 'not', 'explored', 'inexplicable', 'modern', 'viewer', 'rather', 'plain', 'poor', 'previously', 'unloved', 'Jane', 'would', 'leave', 'rich', 'charming', 'hunk', 'life', 'being', 'adored', 'wander', 'impoverished', 'friendless', 'moors', 'Rochester', 'Bronte', 'novel', 'was', 'little', 'scary', 'even', 'dangerous', 'was', 'always', 'more', 'hint', 'Jane', 'stayed', 'might', 'end', 'up', 'abandoned', 'disgraced', 'making', 'choice', 'leaving', 'much', 'more', 'understandable.Though', 'somewhat', 'rushed', 'do', 'scenes', 'Jane', 'childhood', 'time', 'Rivers', 'family', 'proposal', 'St.', 'John', 'also', 'given', 'fair', 'coverage', 'did', 'not', 'twin', 'imagery', 'Rochester', 'passion', 'nature', 'were', 'pure', 'invention', 'version', 'small', 'point', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'have', 'blond', 'Blanche', 'Ingram', 'when', 'are', 'many', 'beautiful', 'black', 'haired', 'actresses', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'fit', 'novel', 'description', 'much', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'better', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'flaws', 'enjoyable', 'entertaining', 'production']",N/A
1021251,A39U9CG766Y5TW,B000IJ7H2C,"Tara Lohman ""constant reader""","[41, 47]","I just received my DVD of this fabulous adaptation of my favorite classic,  and I could not stop watching it!  My first thought when I heard there was yet another version was,  ""Good grief,  why do they need another one?""  (my same reaction when I heard that another Pride and Prejudice was being made).  I own a copy of nearly every version of Jane Eyre that has been made,  except for the Orson Welles version,  which I hated anyway.  This is by far one of the most worthy additions to the list.I had not thought that the 1983 Timothy Dalton version could be topped,  but I believe this one did it.  I had my own gripes with that version-Timothy Dalton was far too beautiful to play Rochester and Zelah Clarke was too old (she looked 27,  not 18) too curvy (Jane was very tiny and thin),  and far too perky.  But it followed the book much more than did other versions.  However,  this adaptation followed the book quite well,  more so than the Ciaran Hinds version did.  I love Hinds in anything he does,  but he admits he hadn't read the book,  and played Rochester as a raging bull type of character.Toby Stephens looks Rochester's age,  36-38,  and he is very nice looking but not too handsome for the role.  He does a good job expressing both Rochester's deep seated emotional pain and his quixotic sense of humour.  Ruth Wilson is amazing,  sometimes plain and sometimes as beautiful as Rochester tells her she is in the book.  The chemistry between the two is electric,  you really believe their feelings.This isn't perfect,  of course.  Rochester is supposed to be very dark,  with black hair and black eyes.  I always look to the last scenes to see how the versions portray Rochester's injuries.  In the book,  he has lost his left eye and his face is terribly scarred.  His other eye is injured but he regains the sight in it over several years.  He also loses his left hand.  In this version,  Rochester appears to stay blind permanently.  His scarring consists of what looks like some acne on the left side of his face,  and his hand is intact but bandaged.  The book doesn't portray Rochester and Jane lying on her bed with him feeling her up as he tries to convince her to stay,  nor does she lie on top of Rochester once she agrees to marry him.  (although she does sit on his lap).  But if the book didn't have them sprawled all over each other,  you know they WANTED to be,  and the book might well have been written that way had it not been written in the mid-1800's.  These touches add to the vein of passion that runs all through the book,  you cannot deny that Jane and Rochester are highly sexual people.  So I didn't object to the slight touches of added sexuality,  in fact,  (snicker)  I hit the remote and watched them more than once!This film also didn't really touch on Jane's deep religious faith or strong sense of self,  so people of today watching this might not ""get""  why Jane had to leave her true love.  It was a bit silly to have the line in which Rochester offers to take her off to live as brother and sister,  as he obviously wants a sexual relationship with Jane as part and parcel of his great love for her.  And Jane leaves precisely because she KNOWS she wants him too and can't live as a mistress,  as she values herself too highly and knows how Rochester came to despise his other mistresses.  The version also doesn't make it clear how Charlotte Bronte,  and her character,  both believed in the guiding of Providence in lives.  Jane didn't go back to Rochester because her values had changed,  she went back because she felt God leading her back to him as opposed to leading her to marry St.John (another fascinating and complex character who was given rather short shrift,  but then,  how does one really explain St. John Rivers,  anyway?)All in all,  this is among the best,  if not the best,  of the Jane Eyre adaptations.  I used to belong to an online Bronte discussion group,  and we would spend a lot of time planning the definitive,  ""Jane Eyre to end all Jane Eyre""  versions.  We didn't have any of these casting choices,  but I have to say this version certainly comes close to what every Jane Eyre fan could possibly want.",5,Stayed up half the night to watch the whole thing!,1172966400,"03 4, 2007",2007,4183,"['just', 'received', 'DVD', 'fabulous', 'adaptation', 'favorite', 'classic', 'could', 'not', 'stop', 'watching', 'My', 'first', 'thought', 'when', 'heard', 'was', 'yet', 'version', 'was', 'Good', 'grief', 'why', 'do', 'need', 'one', 'same', 'reaction', 'when', 'heard', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'was', 'being', 'made', 'own', 'copy', 'nearly', 'version', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'been', 'made', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'version', 'hated', 'anyway', 'far', 'one', 'most', 'worthy', 'additions', 'list.I', 'had', 'not', 'thought', '1983', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'version', 'could', 'be', 'topped', 'believe', 'one', 'did', 'had', 'own', 'gripes', 'version-Timothy', 'Dalton', 'was', 'far', 'too', 'beautiful', 'play', 'Rochester', 'Zelah', 'Clarke', 'was', 'too', 'old', 'looked', '27', 'not', '18', 'too', 'curvy', 'Jane', 'was', 'very', 'tiny', 'thin', 'far', 'too', 'perky', 'followed', 'book', 'much', 'more', 'did', 'other', 'versions', 'However', 'adaptation', 'followed', 'book', 'quite', 'well', 'more', 'so', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'version', 'did', 'love', 'Hinds', 'anything', 'had', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'played', 'Rochester', 'raging', 'bull', 'type', 'character.Toby', 'Stephens', 'Rochester', 'age', '36-38', 'very', 'nice', 'looking', 'not', 'too', 'handsome', 'role', 'good', 'job', 'expressing', 'Rochester', 'deep', 'seated', 'emotional', 'pain', 'quixotic', 'sense', 'humour', 'Ruth', 'Wilson', 'amazing', 'sometimes', 'plain', 'sometimes', 'as', 'beautiful', 'Rochester', 'book', 'chemistry', 'two', 'electric', 'really', 'believe', 'feelings.This', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'course', 'Rochester', 'supposed', 'be', 'very', 'dark', 'black', 'hair', 'black', 'eyes', 'always', 'look', 'last', 'scenes', 'see', 'how', 'versions', 'portray', 'Rochester', 'injuries', 'book', 'lost', 'left', 'eye', 'face', 'terribly', 'scarred', 'other', 'eye', 'injured', 'sight', 'several', 'years', 'also', 'left', 'hand', 'version', 'Rochester', 'stay', 'blind', 'permanently', 'scarring', 'consists', 'what', 'acne', 'left', 'side', 'face', 'hand', 'intact', 'bandaged', 'book', ""n't"", 'portray', 'Rochester', 'Jane', 'lying', 'bed', 'feeling', 'up', 'convince', 'stay', 'lie', 'top', 'Rochester', 'once', 'marry', 'sit', 'lap', 'book', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'sprawled', 'other', 'know', 'WANTED', 'be', 'book', 'might', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'way', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'written', 'mid-1800', 'touches', 'add', 'vein', 'passion', 'book', 'can', 'not', 'deny', 'Jane', 'Rochester', 'are', 'highly', 'sexual', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'object', 'slight', 'touches', 'added', 'sexuality', 'fact', 'snicker', 'hit', 'remote', 'watched', 'more', 'once', 'film', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'touch', 'Jane', 'deep', 'religious', 'faith', 'strong', 'sense', 'self', 'people', 'today', 'watching', 'might', 'not', 'get', 'why', 'Jane', 'had', 'leave', 'true', 'love', 'was', 'bit', 'silly', 'have', 'line', 'Rochester', 'take', 'off', 'live', 'brother', 'sister', 'obviously', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'Jane', 'part', 'parcel', 'great', 'love', 'Jane', 'precisely', 'KNOWS', 'too', 'ca', ""n't"", 'live', 'mistress', 'too', 'highly', 'how', 'Rochester', 'came', 'despise', 'other', 'mistresses', 'version', 'also', ""n't"", 'make', 'clear', 'how', 'Charlotte', 'Bronte', 'character', 'believed', 'guiding', 'Providence', 'lives', 'Jane', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'back', 'Rochester', 'values', 'had', 'changed', 'went', 'back', 'felt', 'God', 'leading', 'back', 'opposed', 'leading', 'marry', 'St.John', 'fascinating', 'complex', 'character', 'who', 'was', 'given', 'rather', 'short', 'shrift', 'then', 'how', 'one', 'really', 'explain', 'St.', 'John', 'Rivers', 'anyway', 'best', 'not', 'best', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'adaptations', 'used', 'belong', 'online', 'Bronte', 'discussion', 'group', 'would', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'planning', 'definitive', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'end', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'versions', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'casting', 'choices', 'have', 'say', 'version', 'certainly', 'close', 'what', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'fan', 'could', 'possibly', 'want']",N/A

The Dalton version,so faithful to the original novel is still excellent, though on re-viewing seems locked indoors and low-budget.The Dalton version gave the story about 6 hours, with a substantial amount of time spent on Jane's childhood at the horrible boarding school.Again, this was straight from the novel, but, let's face it, for those of us who know the story, we're waiting for her to grow up and meet Mr. Rochester.Now, on to the current version.  The story remains a great mixture of seething passion, frustrated hopes on both sides, and the struggle within one heroine between steely, virtuous, self-reliance, and a simple desire to be loved. Toby Stevens is younger than the hero is often portrayed, but still looks as if he's seen the world and fought against the unhappiness and cynicism that years of dissipated living can bring.  He is handsome, but not pretty.  Ruth Wilson's Jane is written as chaste but not priggish,  lonely but eager to love, and, most especially, strong and independent, but in no way inappropriately feminist for the 19th century of the setting. If anything she's a bit more physically passionate than we've seen before, but it does make her seem more real.The budget is high and it shows--lots of gorgeous outdoor scenes, beautiful period interiors , sumptuous gowns. Here and there there are some breaches of Victorian etiquette that don't ring quite true, and there are of course some deletions and skimping on some of the story lines,particularly with the Rivers family.  However, I think once the decision was made to have this fit into 4 hours, the plot choices they made were mostly good ones.  There is great chemistry between the two principals and most importantly, they seem entirely believable and at home in the period of the story.

I've always hated Jane Eyre movies. Love period movies, but never jived with J.E. Every rendition that I had seen (about five) always left me feeling like I never want to see that movie again, mainly because Edward was either portrayed as a straight jerk or a bratty little boy. So I was going to continue flipping, but I suddenly wanted to see who was playing Mr. Rochester. So we get our first seen with him and from then on I was hooked. I loved how Toby Stephens delivered all of his opening lines (and all afterwards too) and Ruth Wilson is the best Jane Eyre that I have ever seen. I had never seen such great, intense chemistry between the characters of Jane and Edward...ever!  I cared so much for them both. I was completely taken by surprise especially because of my long standing against seeing any more Jane Eyre movies. As a person who has always felt this way, I am so glad I didn't change the channel.

(NEARLY 400!!--with a relative smattering of lower scores)I LOVE THE CHEMISTRY AND SUBTLE BELIEVABILITY OF THE LEADS.  RUTH WILSON AND TOBY STEPHENS RULE!!  THEY'VE GIVEN DEPTH AND MAGIC TO THE ROLES LIKE NONE BEFORE--IMH0.  DO love the others! Several are wonderful; but THIS version conveys the magic of this particular romance with so many nuanced and believable interactions it just stands above all the others---again--IMHO.  I simply adore this version!  I just can't praise it enough.  (I've never seen Rochester so well portrayed. Same for Jane Eyre, tho' I've enjoyed several others very much.)ENJOY!!!I've since re-watched this version---and I have SO much to say, yet I'll try to be concise:  Ruth Wilson is just breathtaking in how much she communicates without a word.  It took re-watching it to remember how rare and vital an infusion of character this affects.  Her nuanced performance is more an embodiment than acting---and that in the rarest sense.  I've rarely in my life--and I've spent this life as a movie enthusiast--found so rarefied a 'performance'.  Never have I seen Jane played to palpably, so embodied a Jane as elicits profound appreciation for who Jane really is and why; and---how they came to fall deeply in love.  It's obvious in this version beyond all the others--as I recall.NOW---the hesitant confession:  I've never read the book--but, please, before I'm too harshly judged for that, simply let it be said that I JUDGE THIS ON THE WELL KNOWN STORY, and in context of (rather than comparison with) the almost countless other versions--many of which I've seen two or several times each.  Before I started this I'd just watched the proposal and their intimate talks before going shopping.  I thought to myself:  ""I don't care what was written in the original book unless it's at least as wonderful as this movie version.""  That is how I feel about this movie.  I still love most of the other versions, but this one is the one that IS ""Jane Eyre"" to me.  I wish to one day feast on the book, but with severe A.D.D. it's really hard for me to stay put with books.  Meanwhile, I'll come here for bathing my romantic heart & temperament in ""Jane & Rochester"".Before I go--I just can't say enough about how similarly, palpably Toby Stephens expressed Edward Rochester.  I can barely believe the chemistry and how well it was embodied in these two unforgettable performances.  In other versions, to varying degrees, I couldn't quite buy-in to how he intentionally, recklessly misled Jane to do with his marriage issues, not to mention the wondering why she loved him SO--given his temperament & near-cruelty.  In this version, thanks to Toby's incredibly nuanced embodiment of Rochester, I could not only see why he held off and tested on so many levels for so many substantive reasons, why his nature was compelled to test the waters until the moment he knew FOR CERTAIN that she was UTTERLY in love with him; but, also, that it was OBVIOUS HOW & WHY THEIR NATURES CAME TO SO ADORE EACH OTHER---like no other version I recall---at least not quite like this one.Oh,well.  So much for being concise.If you prefer other versions I can only hope you love them as much as I this one.  Thanks for your time.  Bill, Evergreen, Colorado",5,"THE Jane Eyre to watch!!
