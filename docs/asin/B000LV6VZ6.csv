Each season has a whole new set of typical family issues that gets resolved through love and teamwork on the part of this huge family.  Each role played has their own personality and it's fun to see the kids grow up and evolve.  The father being a minister at a church but admits he's not perfect, nor thinks his children should be either is well.....refreshing to say the least.  This is one of those family shows that served as a great role model for the American family.  Season 4 is the best Season ever but I am saying that with each new Season I'm watching.

I will decide how many stars this set really deserves after I've seen more of the episodes.But I just had a question and I was wondering if someone reading, knows the answer. Soon after I got this set, I just happened to be looking at the back of the box, near the bottom, there was a small addition that stated ""Some episodes may be edited from their original network version"", and ""Music has been changed for this home entertainment version"".Now I don't care much about changes in music, but what editing of episodes are they referring to? Does anyone know? Obviously it means that they are using the syndicated episodes, with cut scenes. But which episodes and which scenes have been cut in this set.Has anyone watched this set's episodes in comparison with the version recorded from the network airing. I have most if not all of Season 4's episodes on VHS tape. Unfortunately, they are all scattered on different VHS tapes in a multitude of different boxes, so finding each episode, will be difficult, and take an inordinate amount of time.So does anyone know which scenes from which episodes have been cut from this DVD set?? I really want to know.Not that it would have changed my mind about buying it, but maybe I would have bought it from somewhere cheaper than Best Buy, or I would have waited until it went on sale to buy it instead of buying it for full price.I am really disappointed to discover after buying it that Season 4 is using cut episodes for this set.But I'd at least like to know what scenes I am missing and in what episodes, so I can watch those specific episodes on my VHS tapes (until I convert them to DVD) instead.",3,7th Heaven - Season 4 DVD Set,1175299200,"03 31, 2007",2007,1876,"['just', 'bought', '7th', 'Heaven', 'Season', '4', 'set', 'past', 'week', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'couple', 'episodes', 'so', ""'ll"", 'hold', 'off', 'actually', 'reviewing', 'set', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'it.That', 'also', 'why', ""'ve"", 'only', 'given', 'set', '3', 'stars', 'will', 'decide', 'how', 'many', 'stars', 'set', 'really', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'more', 'episodes.But', 'just', 'had', 'question', 'was', 'wondering', 'someone', 'reading', 'answer', 'Soon', 'got', 'set', 'just', 'happened', 'be', 'looking', 'back', 'box', 'bottom', 'was', 'small', 'addition', 'stated', 'episodes', 'may', 'be', 'edited', 'original', 'network', 'version', 'Music', 'been', 'changed', 'home', 'entertainment', 'version', '.Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'changes', 'music', 'what', 'editing', 'episodes', 'are', 'referring', 'Does', 'anyone', 'know', 'are', 'using', 'syndicated', 'episodes', 'cut', 'scenes', 'episodes', 'scenes', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'set.Has', 'anyone', 'watched', 'set', 'episodes', 'comparison', 'version', 'recorded', 'network', 'airing', 'have', 'most', 'not', 'Season', '4', 'episodes', 'VHS', 'tape', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'scattered', 'different', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'multitude', 'different', 'boxes', 'so', 'finding', 'episode', 'will', 'be', 'difficult', 'take', 'inordinate', 'amount', 'time.So', 'anyone', 'know', 'scenes', 'episodes', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'DVD', 'set', 'really', 'want', 'know.Not', 'would', 'have', 'changed', 'mind', 'buying', 'maybe', 'would', 'have', 'bought', 'somewhere', 'cheaper', 'Best', 'Buy', 'would', 'have', 'waited', 'went', 'sale', 'buy', 'instead', 'buying', 'full', 'price.I', 'am', 'really', 'disappointed', 'discover', 'buying', 'Season', '4', 'using', 'cut', 'episodes', 'set.But', ""'d"", 'least', 'know', 'what', 'am', 'missing', 'what', 'episodes', 'can', 'watch', 'specific', 'episodes', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'convert', 'DVD', 'instead']",7th Heaven: Season 4

Here are some of the highlights:EPISODES 1-4:  Starting a new school year and making friends.  Matt wants to move  out, Eric has a heart attack, Aunt Julie is pregnant.  Dramatic episode about the treatment of Afghanistan women.  Lucy gets her driver's license.EPISODE 5--A doozey.  Teen pregnancy with a stand-up and cheer finale, marijuana possession, and cheating on a key high school exam.EPISODE 6--A very pregnant Aunt Julie wants a divorce from doctor husband Hank, but changes her mind when both of them gaze on their new-born baby.EPISODES 7 and 8--The basketball coach locks the gym from low-grade Mary and her teammates, who retaliate with vandalism and get arrested.  Simon is caught giving someone ""the finger"" as a joke in front of Mom and the school principal.EPISODES 9-12--A woman interned during WW2 wants to make a large contribution to the church and debates seeing a fellow internee.  Simon's group sniffs paint thinner fumes.  Annie's father may have Alzheimer's, while Matt mopes over Shawna being at NYU across the country.  Annie goes to a beach cottage for a weekend's solace.EPISODES 13-16--Two cute girls have dinner with Matt and his roommate John.  Eric spies on Mary, who is on a double movie date with Lucy.  Names can hurt.  A child is harrassed for having Tourette's.  Romantic Valentine's Day show.  Eric tries to track down an abused boy who wants a prayer request.EPISODES 17-18--Eric is on jury duty with a bunch of racists; Ruthie realizes that actions have consequences; Matt drives his roommate nuts in not being able to decide whether to see Shawna in Manhattan.EPISODES 19-22--Eric counsels a troubled young girl, while Hank keeps a secret from wife Julie; all five Camden kids (excluding the twins) are caught in adolescent love triangles.Starring are a never-better Stephen Collins as minister father Eric, Catherine Hicks as his wife Annie, Jessica Biel as Mary, Barry Watson as Matt, David Gallagher as Simon, Beverley Mitchell as Lucy, and Mackenzie Rosman as Ruthie.  Guest starring are Maureen Flannigan as Shawna, Deborah Raffin as Julie, and Ed Begley Jr. as Hank.  How did I survive these memorable and sometimes harrowing adolescent years intact?Great parents.As a footnote, let me add that this boxed set claims to have edited episodes and changed music.  I was timing the episodes like a hawk and watching for cuts.  All 22 of them seem fully intact, and the opening and closing music is all there, so Paramount Home Video must have done a very good editing job.  Or just put on the disclaimer for legal reasons.  There are a lot of social activist issues here; maybe some (800) phone number epilogues have been trimmed because they are no longer valid.
