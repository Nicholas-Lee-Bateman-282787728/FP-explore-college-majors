761257,A2S244KFX0745K,B0000A2ZNK,Alan Edward Creager,"[1, 1]","Mind the spoilers.Every once in a while, you come across a movie that goes beyond just being a movie. It is art, perhaps. It is fictional, yes, but almost always films of this unique caliber are in some way being used as a means to very seriously comment on issues facing their country of origin and/or the world at large. ""Bang Bang You're Dead"" is just such a film.""Bang Bang You're Dead"", adapted from a play by the same name, is about a high school student, Trevor, who is attempting to reintegrate himself into his high school after a false bomb threat he made a few months back. Needless to say, this is proving difficult. Things do not get any easier when he decides to take the leading part in a play- none other than the film's namesake. This is the first time I've seen the film adaptation of any written work include the written work in the film. As the title of this film probably confuses some, at first at least, about what kind of a movie it is, so does the play's name cause a great deal of misunderstanding. Tremendous pressure is put on the school and the teacher directing the play to stop it. Enough so that he actually gives up trying to hold practices at the school and asks the students playing parts to practice in meetings off campus.It is at one of those practices that this film shows us what it's all about. Mr. Duncan, asking Trevor about his character, Josh, soon is speaking as if the two are, or rather could be, one and the same. Josh, obviously, in taking a gun to school and killing classmates, feels he has nothing to lose. So why hasn't Trevor done the same? What's stopped him? Mr. Duncan calls it ""X"". Maybe X is cowardice, maybe it's a sense of honor, maybe it's having someone- something- to live for. ""What if I reached into you and took out X?"" Mr. Duncan asks. Trevor says, realizing- ""I'd be Josh.""This, I feel, is the point of ""Bang Bang You're Dead"" as much as anything is. Think about all the young men- and they are almost exclusively young men- who have taken up arms and committed such acts as Josh does in the play. Obviously there was nothing left that could stop them from going through with it. They obviously felt they had a better chance at something than by continuing to live as they'd done. But what about the ones who thought about it, maybe even planned and came just as close as those who actually went all the way, but for some reason didn't? They had X. And the others didn't.Trevor ends up coming pretty close himself. Arrested a second time for another bomb scare, his reputation takes yet another hit and he finds himself with the Trogs, a group of social outcasts who are planning a school shooting. Having been hanging out with them for some time, Trevor films the Trogs as they make their last remarks. The next day, Trevor sees the scouts the Trogs sent in first moving about, and suddenly changes his mind. He informs Mr. Duncan of what's about to happen, and the crucial moment arrives when Duncan must decide himself- does he really believe everything he's been telling Trevor? Does he trust him as much as he's made it seem he does? Duncan apparently decides yes, evacuating the school just in time while Trevor risks his life holding the armed Trogs behind a jammed door as police rush to the school. Unsurprisingly, his reputation changes more than a little. Having both stopped the Trogs and exposed the elitist culture of the school's ""cooler"", often more athletic students, Trevor goes on to perform the role of Josh in the movie's namesake play.Any of us that have gone to a high school in America can testify to the truth this movie contains. It has far more than a lot of us would like to admit. When confronted with the reckless, bullying cruelty that many of the school's athletes feel themselves entitled to, more than a few school administrators squirm uncomfortably. But they actually do something, give some chance for Trevor to prove himself rather than continue to make him the victim of a witch-hunt. The message there is very clear to me- there are Trevors out there. 'Bad' kids who are not truly bad. And what they become is largely up to us. Treat somebody like a monster long enough and eventually they just might decide you've got a point. Once that barrier is passed, it's just a short step towards deciding you've really got nothing to lose, and then- bang bang, you're dead. Give them a chance, though, as the school leadership in this film gives Trevor- they just might surprise you with how well they turn themselves around.I should probably add that this film does not just tell its story from Trevor's perspective. It is primarily his story, yes, but we see at least a glimpse of how pretty much every adult and every teenager associated with Trevor in any way sees things.That's got a lot to do with it being as good a movie as it is.""Bang Bang You're Dead"" is a unique movie, one I am very glad I saw. It got my attention faster, and kept it better, than many far more expensive and better promoted films. It never even saw the inside of a theater, being released directly to television in 2002 and to DVD in 2004, both times with little fanfare. But believe me when I say that out of the many, many films that have come and gone in the past decade, this is one of the few that you truly owe it to yourself to see.",5,Nothing short of the

It explores the graphic truths of school bullying and violence and how it affects its victims. This film, inspired by a true story, should be watched by every parent and everyone that works in an environment with kids. Its hardcore substance will surely touch its viewers like no other. This brilliant plot takes them on a journey to what such torture can result to if nobody listens or takes action. The extremity was necessary as a reality check for certain individuals, especially the language, the violence, and the self-destruction. Through attempted suicide, anger management, loneliness, the school play that relates to what could happen, and others, the realisms remain as powerful as they should be. All events lead to an undeniable conclusion that will keep audiences talking. The performances from the actors add to the emotional stance, namely Ben Foster's career best as the troubled student Trevor. They accent the individual personalities wonderfully. &quot;Bang Bang You're Dead&quot; is a great movie for those looking for a powerful theme. Audiences will never forget this.

Loosely based on the stage play by William Mastrosimone, this holds it's own in a genre not entirely saturated, but where this kind of film exist on various levels. Gus Van Sant's 'Elephant' is too artsy-fartsy, and 'Zero Day', while superb, was too realistic as it's entirely shot on camcorders. Bang, Bang, Your Dead, combines all of the movies about high school dilemmas and shootings, which hit so close to home, it's terrifying.Ben Foster (30 Days of Night, 3:10 to Yuma, Alpha Dog) plays Trevor Adams, readjusting to the first day of school after having to attend summer school because of a bomb threat the previous year. All, teachers and students alike, are suspicious of his return. Randy Harrison (Queer as Folk) plays a cunning, dark role as the leader of the outcast anarchist aptly named 'The Trogs,' and Tom Cavanagh plays the role perfect as his video/drama school teacher who believes in Trevor and sees something others would by ignorance, never see.What really makes this movie absolutely spectacular is the way it flows so freely from one scene to another: from Trevor making his home videos, to his interaction with law enforcement and teachers, to his being picked on and bullied by those ignorant, one tracked football jocks, and his finding perhaps solace in a beautiful girl and yet he manages along the way to capture moving images of the reality of HIS existence and the brutal savagery of the sports masses and the psychological trauma of the youth that are unfortuntely the brunt of their fun. The movie touches on the important subjects of what most large, inner city and suburbian high schools go through. How their sports programs are far more important than the safety of the students, and how bullying in ALL ITS FORMS, can be tormenting to young adults, which they can carry on their whole lives. It shows every single side of the situation and that in itself is a very important element.I must say to you in all honestly, put this on your next que or immediately purchase this, it is truly an experience which you wont soon forget!!4.5 Stars",4,WOW!

The bullying/teasing made me cringe but kids can be THAT cruel.Schools tend to believe the ""normal"" kids more than the outsiders... maybe they don't want to face the truth, who knows... which is probly why some kids don't even bother reporting anything.I could relate to Ben's character Trevor in the way he felt isolated (aside from wanting to blow up the football team).'Bang Bang' sheds some light on how someone could feel helpless/angry/frustrated enough to want to something drastic and how being bullied plays a role in it. *I'm not condoning violence in any way though*The play in the movie no-one in the town wants done but its a sort of therapy for Trevor, working out some of his inner demons and giving him a sense of pride and purpose I guess you could say.He's walking a fine line in the movie, close to the tipping point... the only people who really seem to believe in him are his drama teacher and Jenny.Everyone in the cast gives compelling performances... you really believe them in their roles and lose yourself in the story. Thats the mark of a good movie, which more often than not, hollywood can lose sight of that.I was really impressed by Ben Foster... Trevor's a complicated guy and in the wrong hands it would've been a disaster but Ben really gets into the character, you find yourself rotting for Trevor not to go down the dark road.I can't wait to see what else Ben does... he's sure to have a long career :)'Bang Bang' should be shown in every school.... maybe it would help prevent some school violence and/or tragedyThis movie is a hidden gem that should be more well known...

It's one of those kind of movies that has something for everyone. If you're a teacher, it let's you know what runs through the mind of your students, not only as they are acting like bullies, but also as they are being bullied. If you're the parent, it helps to explain why your child has become quiet and withdrawn. And if your the kid being bullied, it not only shows there is help out there, but what happens to you if you ignore it. This movie should be required for anyone who wants to be a teacher, for anyone who is a student, or for anyone who is working with students. If this movie had been out sooner, maybe we could have avoided Columbine. This movie goes in-depth as to what occurs in the mind of a kid as he's being bullied around through the day, and I think what makes this movie good is the fact that he video tapes everything, so when he gets busted, the parents and teachers can't say ""oh, your just exagerating things, it's not really that bad"". Instead, he has proof that what may seem like a little bit at a time adds up until it is overwhelming and results in ""oh my God, how could something like this happen?"" I think that it is something that everyone should watch because it has everyone in it. Were you the teacher who didn't see what was happening? You're in it. Were you the parent that didn't understand what was happening to your child? You're in it also. Maybe you were the kid in school everybody picked on everyday, stuffed in the trashcan, locked in your locker, beat up in the bathroom, ignored because you weren't as popular, all because the crowd thought it was cool.

Speaking as a person who was bullied throughout middle and high school although no doubtetley  not as bad as some others i can say this movie comes as close to the real high school experience as i have ever seen. Ben fosters performance is simply breathtaking.The scene where they watch the confiscated  video from his locker is heartbreaking. That scene alone stays with me for days after i watch it.  There is no better way to sum up what bullying really does to a person than that scene. I remember exactly what it feels like to look in the mirror and not recognize yourself anymore. And as much as i try to shake that feeling i know it never completely goes away. The rest of the cast does a terrific job as well. And the writing is great and has some very memorable parts such as when the teacher says to ben fosters character 'you should decide who you are before everyone else does' or something along those lines. The only downside to this movie to me is that they kind of chicken out at the end. I not going to ruin the ending but if a person is pushed enough they may push back and it isn't a happy ending for anyone.  But aside from that very minor detail this is a five star movie all the way. This is a movie i will watch years and years from now.

This film is 11 years old and talks about bullying in schools, how it's a huge problem instead of harmless fun, and how it changes students lives forever. Some students become withdrawn, others depressed, some suicidal, and in the rare cases homicidal. This film follows a bullied student, named Trevor, who is on the edge of becoming all four when his drama teachers asks him to be in the play, Bang Bang You're Dead. It is a play inspired by Columbine, that takes place inside the mind of a school shooter, who is haunted by those he killed. This leads to the main point of this film, will the teacher and play save Trevor or push him over the edge? On a personal note, I was pretty small and got bullied at school, until I hit puberty. This is the first film that was actually able to express all the emotions I've had inside of me for so long. Trevor expresses every feeling and emotion that comes along with being a victim and feeling helpless. By the end of this film, I was crying like a baby.
