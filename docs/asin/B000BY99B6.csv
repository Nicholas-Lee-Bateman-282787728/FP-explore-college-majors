952466,A2YXVFVKQ9SGGV,B000BY99B6,"B. Evans ""Nanticoke Lenni-Lenape""","[2, 4]","The only problem with this film is that it is 50 years too late with its message.  Even as early as 1963, there were people from the West Indies who had been living in Africa for 30 years.  When I arrived in 1964 my first question was, &#34;How long have West Indians been living in Kenya?&#34;  If African-Americans ever hoped to change  the status of and assist in contributing to Africa's educational, economic development and corporate structure, they should have come in the 1960s when independence was spreading throughout the continent. Many of the countries, like Ghana were open to black immigration, so African-Americans have missed the boat on that one.Some African-Americans are moving to South Africa at this time.  There is a lot of work to be done there, but first they'd have to remember to leave behind the old 'superiority complex' that many have about being born in the United States.  Also they'd do well to know that there are many highly educated people  in Africa.  I first became aware of this  in the 1960-70s when I asked an African gentleman, &#34;What area did you study for your Ph.D.?&#34; to which he replied, &#34;Which one?&#34; Over here, people think they've achieved something if they've obtained a B.A.--shocking!!  As for languages a good number of people speak Swahili, English and French, in addition to indigenous languages, while over here we are still stumbling over English.  When I was living in Israel, there were Kenyan students who spoke fluent Hebrew also.  Nowadays, they are learning Chinese (particularly in Mombasa).  That's just a little 'eye opener' as to to the type of people you will encounter and how far behind  we are.Bonita Evans, Ph.D.",3,500 years later,1363910400,"03 22, 2013",2013,1698,"['only', 'problem', 'film', '50', 'years', 'too', 'late', 'message', 'Even', 'as', 'early', '1963', 'were', 'people', 'West', 'Indies', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'living', 'Africa', '30', 'years', 'When', 'arrived', '1964', 'first', 'question', 'was', '34', 'How', 'long', 'have', 'West', 'Indians', 'been', 'living', 'Kenya', '34', 'African-Americans', 'ever', 'hoped', 'change', 'status', 'assist', 'contributing', 'Africa', 'educational', 'economic', 'development', 'corporate', 'structure', 'should', 'have', 'come', '1960s', 'when', 'independence', 'was', 'spreading', 'continent', 'Many', 'countries', 'Ghana', 'were', 'open', 'black', 'immigration', 'so', 'African-Americans', 'have', 'missed', 'boat', 'one.Some', 'African-Americans', 'are', 'moving', 'South', 'Africa', 'time', 'lot', 'work', 'be', 'done', 'there', 'first', ""'d"", 'have', 'remember', 'leave', 'old', ""'superiority"", 'complex', 'many', 'have', 'being', 'born', 'United', 'States', 'Also', ""'d"", 'do', 'well', 'know', 'are', 'many', 'highly', 'educated', 'people', 'Africa', 'first', 'became', 'aware', '1960-70s', 'when', 'asked', 'African', 'gentleman', '34', 'What', 'area', 'did', 'study', 'Ph.D.', '34', 'replied', '34', 'Which', 'one', '34', 'here', 'people', 'think', ""'ve"", 'achieved', 'something', ""'ve"", 'obtained', 'B.A.', 'shocking', 'languages', 'good', 'number', 'people', 'speak', 'Swahili', 'English', 'French', 'addition', 'indigenous', 'languages', 'here', 'are', 'still', 'stumbling', 'English', 'When', 'was', 'living', 'Israel', 'were', 'Kenyan', 'students', 'who', 'spoke', 'fluent', 'Hebrew', 'also', 'Nowadays', 'are', 'learning', 'Chinese', 'particularly', 'Mombasa', 'just', 'little', ""'eye"", 'opener', 'type', 'people', 'will', 'encounter', 'how', 'far', 'are.Bonita', 'Evans', 'Ph.D']",500 Years Later: Directors Cut

952475,AOVU5A9GVXHFT,B000BY99B6,Margaret Opine,"[2, 3]","WE MUST LEARN HOW TO TALK TO BE MOST EFFECTIVE AND MOST AFFECTIVE...we must learn what to say and how to say fight with words that do not say 'fight' because we can win the fight if we do that.  We can stop saying ""slave""--that would be a great start... and then wonder why people take such pleasure in saying 'slave' and the memory of enslavement, which serves as a psychological EMPOWERMENT base for some people.  There are between 200,000-400,000 people, even as high as millions of people held in bondage in America right now as I compose this and they are beaten and dehumanized and forced to ""act like a slave"" and some of the people holding others are every color and some who are held by others are every color but most are children. Slavery is not black! Enslavement is not black and people who are dehumanized and forced to act like a slave are not just black people. Bondage and enslavement is a human condition; people will do it; that's guranteed.  Over the past 40 years of my scholarship I've asked hundreds of people what color is slavery and they all said 'black' and I informed them no, the color of bondage and enslavement is human; all humans have done it and all humans will continue to do it in eras and times. In this documentary an African woman wanted to make the statement that in Africa slavery was there but not like in America...that the African slave is a part of the family. Any person held in bondage is certainly not family. The one thing that says so with any animal is: if the gate is left open they will escape.  BUT THEN PEOPLE DO ESCAPE FROM THEIR OWN FAMILY for abuse and dehumanization; so the mention of family when it comes to mistreatment and abuse across the board gives rise to escape.So I think it is important to know that ""slavery"" is not over like some young people told me and I had to burst their bubble: their illusion.  Slavery is never over; it is a part of the human experience and ""civilizations"" have to fight Hell; they have to fight like crazy to keep atrocities out of their world.  I am so reminded of Jesus on the Cross and the message he brought in his life and the message he left in his death: ""DON'T DO THIS...SUCH AS THIS IS NOT DONE IN THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN.""(my paraphrased)  Atrocity is a part of the human condition that must be addressed and guarded against around the globe in every human society. *THE INSTITUTION OF AMERICAN BONDAGE & ENSLAVEMENT & ATROCITATION of millions of Africans and Native Americans were extraordinary atrocities bar none but then in Germany the dehumanization and atrocitation of the Jews were equally evil.[Evil is the enemy far more that people.]ALL PEOPLE DO NOT DO ALL THINGS IN ALL TIMES but things are inevitably done in times because they are human things that are done, even the process of dehumanization.There are so many ways to fight this without picking up a gun. I have taken to writing people my famous letters. If a columnist (no matter skin color) use the word 'minorities' they get a letter from me: Please explain what is meant by 'minorities' is an equalized society.  And if you do explain this I will write you back and let you know you are outdated and antithetical to the American constitution and you are definitely thinking like a racist. Enough of those letters sent to media and they will stop using the phrase: minority, disadvantaged, deprived, depraved.  All got letters from me.  The embarrassment shutdown some of their use but others rebel and use those words even more.In this documentary I heard a lot of details that differ from what I read in books and journals: like in one port alone the Europeans had detailed records for 6 million Africans they comandeered and there were hundreds of ports.  I read estimates that numbered from 6million to 66million to 666million albeit someone may have been trying to create the devil symbol 666 but in that documentary there were records that clearly inferred what was being said had some validity about the numbers. It was like the biggest atrocity or coming close to the 35 million lost in China in another civil mishap and atrocity.Rape appears all around the world so does bondage and enslavement. We need to learn how to voice this. We want people to join the movement to look out for and stamp out atrocity  as it buds. PLEASE use the phrase: ""HELD IN BONDAGE AND FORCED TO ACT LIKE A SLAVE"" instead of saying the word 'slave' as if it is a real identity, as if the atrociters were able to create this illusion for real....because the biological anatomy of the human has no cells in it marked S. A 'slave' is a perceived vision; it does not exist; it is an inhumane enforcement in reality: a perceived creation that is only real and true in the minds of the atrociters but history tells us clearly it was never true no matter how much an atrociter tortured his/her victim. *AFRICANS IN AMERICA had night schools even though it meant a loss of eyesight, life or limbs.I think we can make a gain from this view of it and rush to do our bit against it because we have to stand against atrocity around the planet. We have no time to waste; atrocity is constantly underway.THANK YOU.
