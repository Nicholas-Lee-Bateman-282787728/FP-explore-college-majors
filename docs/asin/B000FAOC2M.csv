During the course of the current decade we've seen a lot of recycled trash over and over again. They don't scare us anymore, we can literally predict what's going to happen next and who's going to die, the plots are full of holes, the acting is bad, etc. Although critics and some moviegoers were decidedly mixed about this film, I personally loved it and it now ranks as one of my favorite horror films of this decade next to my other favorite horror films of this decade like the Resident Evil films, Silent Hill, The Descent, the Dawn of the Dead remake, Jeepers Creepers 1 and 2, and the Final Destination trilogy. The Hills Have Eyes is one of the most disturbing and gory films ever made, and it will shock you (And I'm a person who hardly has any emotion).WHAT IT'S ABOUT: The Carter family is on a cross-country trip to California, and on their way through New Mexico they stop at a gas station in the middle of nowhere and owner of the station tells them about a faster route to California through the desert. The family listens and takes the road and while on the road all of their tires flatten simultaneously, and their SUV crashes into a rock and is totaled. Now the family is trapped in the middle of nowhere, but by the end of the night realize that they are not alone in this desert. They are now being hunted by cannibalistic mutants (Who became this way because of nuclear radiation due to nuclear testing in the 50's) who will stop at nothing to kill them.MUSIC: The music provides a great atmosphere for this film. It is very well composed and fits the vibe perfectly.ACTION: This film is a nasty gore fest and is without a doubt one of the goriest films ever made. This film is very suspenseful, and there is a chance that it may actually scare you unlike most horror films. Not to mention the shocking rape scene in the film. This film is one helluva suspenseful ride that will keep you on the edge of your seat.ACTING: Most of the time the acting is generally good, but there are times in which the acting falls under the curse of many horror films with either awkward dialogue or just bad acting. It's good most of the time though and is believable most of the time.OVERALL: Craving a good horror film? Need a horror film that's gory yet scary at the same time? This is one of your best options in this current decade. It's a fantastic horror film that's damn scary and yet disgustingly gory at the same time. Easily one of the most shocking films in a very long time.THE GOOD: Shocking gore factor, great music, great scare-factor, good acting, great mutant designs, and cool action scenes.THE BAD: Moments of bad acting or dialogue.",5,A PROFOUNDLY DISTURBING SHOCKING GORE FEST  9.25 OUT OF 10,1237939200,"03 25, 2009",2009,2708,"['Good', 'horror', 'films', 'are', 'hard', 'come', 'days', 'course', 'current', 'decade', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'recycled', 'trash', 'over', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'scare', 'anymore', 'can', 'literally', 'predict', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'who', 'going', 'die', 'plots', 'are', 'full', 'holes', 'acting', 'bad', 'etc', 'critics', 'moviegoers', 'were', 'decidedly', 'mixed', 'film', 'personally', 'loved', 'now', 'one', 'favorite', 'horror', 'films', 'decade', 'other', 'favorite', 'horror', 'films', 'decade', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'films', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'Descent', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'remake', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', '1', '2', 'Final', 'Destination', 'trilogy', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'one', 'most', 'disturbing', 'gory', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'will', 'shock', ""'m"", 'person', 'who', 'hardly', 'emotion', 'IT', 'ABOUT', 'Carter', 'family', 'cross-country', 'trip', 'California', 'way', 'New', 'Mexico', 'stop', 'gas', 'station', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'owner', 'station', 'faster', 'route', 'California', 'desert', 'family', 'road', 'road', 'tires', 'flatten', 'simultaneously', 'SUV', 'crashes', 'rock', 'totaled', 'Now', 'family', 'trapped', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'end', 'night', 'realize', 'are', 'not', 'alone', 'desert', 'are', 'now', 'being', 'hunted', 'cannibalistic', 'mutants', 'Who', 'became', 'way', 'nuclear', 'radiation', 'due', 'nuclear', 'testing', '50', 'who', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'kill', 'them.MUSIC', 'music', 'great', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'composed', 'vibe', 'perfectly.ACTION', 'film', 'nasty', 'gore', 'fest', 'doubt', 'one', 'goriest', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'film', 'very', 'suspenseful', 'chance', 'may', 'actually', 'scare', 'most', 'horror', 'films', 'Not', 'mention', 'shocking', 'rape', 'scene', 'film', 'film', 'one', 'helluva', 'suspenseful', 'ride', 'will', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat.ACTING', 'Most', 'time', 'acting', 'generally', 'good', 'are', 'times', 'acting', 'falls', 'curse', 'many', 'horror', 'films', 'awkward', 'dialogue', 'just', 'bad', 'acting', 'good', 'most', 'time', 'believable', 'most', 'time.OVERALL', 'Craving', 'good', 'horror', 'film', 'Need', 'horror', 'film', 'gory', 'yet', 'scary', 'same', 'time', 'one', 'best', 'options', 'current', 'decade', 'fantastic', 'horror', 'film', 'damn', 'scary', 'yet', 'disgustingly', 'gory', 'same', 'time', 'Easily', 'one', 'most', 'shocking', 'films', 'very', 'long', 'time.THE', 'GOOD', 'Shocking', 'gore', 'factor', 'great', 'music', 'great', 'scare-factor', 'good', 'acting', 'great', 'mutant', 'designs', 'cool', 'action', 'scenes.THE', 'BAD', 'Moments', 'bad', 'acting', 'dialogue']",The Hills Have Eyes

986831,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B000FAOC2M,A. Estes,"[3, 4]","I have very vague memories of the original ""The Hills Have Eyes"" and that's because I have only seen it once. When I was 14 I was lucky enough to catch the sucker late at night on some movie channel and it's been in the back of my mind ever since. Maybe it was just the right time for me (seeing it so late at night, completely isolated from everyone else) but the movie was perfect. Well, Hollywood can't just leave well enough alone. With successful remakes of ""Dawn Of The Dead"" and ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" paving room for less than thrilling remakes like ""When A Stranger Calls"" and ""The Fog,"" I think it's safe to say that every horror movie we love prior to the 80's will eventually pop up in this new-millennium abyss of rehashes/remakes.""The Hills Have Eyes,"" however, is a different beast. Produced by it's original director, Wes Craven, this remake/re-imagining does exactly what any well-made remake should do. It updates what needs to be updated, while staying true to the source and not skimping on the scares. Alexandre Aja (""High Tension"") sits in the director's chair with Craven babysitting and does a tremendous job. Everything that made the original great is maginified with the 2006 version. I could do without a few plot-holes (the distance between the abandoned town and the trailer shortens up as the movie progresses) but overall what we have here is a tight flick. The gore effects, courtesy of the KNB crew, are spectacular and over-the-top. Aja's direction is top notch, he delivers enough style but not so much as to take away from the realness of the flick. There are moments here that may be a bit too disturbing for some (this is the first horror movie I've seen people walk out of) but Aja handles it with such realism. Despite the lack of character development in some parts, it's still intriguing and I found myself stuck in the story.The movie isn't exactly perfect. The plot-holes and the lack of character development are prime examples, but overall it's a tightly made movie. It's not afraid to go too far when other movies just cower away. Definitely not your typical neutered remake. In what is starting out to be a great year for horror (beginning with ""Hostel"" and ""Final Destination 3"") ""The Hills Have Eyes"" provides even more hope that horror is coming back stronger. Aja has delivered another grand-slam and lord knows where his career will take him next. The bottom line on this movie is that if you liked the original movie, then the remake is definitely something you can't pass up.",4,How A Remake Should Be Done,1142380800,"03 15, 2006",2006,2537,"['have', 'very', 'vague', 'memories', 'original', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'have', 'only', 'seen', 'once', 'When', 'was', '14', 'was', 'lucky', 'enough', 'catch', 'sucker', 'late', 'night', 'movie', 'channel', 'been', 'back', 'mind', 'ever', 'Maybe', 'was', 'just', 'right', 'time', 'seeing', 'so', 'late', 'night', 'completely', 'isolated', 'everyone', 'else', 'movie', 'was', 'perfect', 'Well', 'Hollywood', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'leave', 'well', 'enough', 'alone', 'successful', 'remakes', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'paving', 'room', 'less', 'thrilling', 'remakes', 'When', 'Stranger', 'Calls', 'Fog', 'think', 'safe', 'say', 'horror', 'movie', 'love', 'prior', '80', 'will', 'eventually', 'pop', 'up', 'new-millennium', 'abyss', 'rehashes/remakes', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'however', 'different', 'beast', 'Produced', 'original', 'director', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'remake/re-imagining', 'exactly', 'what', 'well-made', 'remake', 'should', 'do', 'what', 'be', 'updated', 'staying', 'true', 'source', 'not', 'skimping', 'scares', 'Alexandre', 'Aja', 'High', 'Tension', 'director', 'chair', 'Craven', 'babysitting', 'tremendous', 'job', 'Everything', 'made', 'original', 'great', 'maginified', '2006', 'version', 'could', 'do', 'few', 'plot-holes', 'distance', 'abandoned', 'town', 'trailer', 'up', 'movie', 'overall', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'tight', 'flick', 'gore', 'effects', 'courtesy', 'KNB', 'crew', 'are', 'spectacular', 'over-the-top', 'Aja', 'direction', 'top', 'notch', 'enough', 'style', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'take', 'away', 'realness', 'flick', 'are', 'moments', 'here', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'too', 'disturbing', 'first', 'horror', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'people', 'walk', 'Aja', 'such', 'realism', 'lack', 'character', 'development', 'parts', 'still', 'intriguing', 'found', 'stuck', 'story.The', 'movie', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'perfect', 'plot-holes', 'lack', 'character', 'development', 'are', 'prime', 'examples', 'overall', 'tightly', 'made', 'movie', 'not', 'afraid', 'go', 'too', 'far', 'when', 'other', 'movies', 'just', 'cower', 'away', 'Definitely', 'not', 'typical', 'neutered', 'remake', 'what', 'starting', 'out', 'be', 'great', 'year', 'horror', 'beginning', 'Hostel', 'Final', 'Destination', '3', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'even', 'more', 'hope', 'horror', 'coming', 'back', 'stronger', 'Aja', 'delivered', 'grand-slam', 'lord', 'where', 'career', 'will', 'take', 'next', 'bottom', 'line', 'movie', 'liked', 'original', 'movie', 'then', 'remake', 'definitely', 'something', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pass', 'up']",The Hills Have Eyes

986834,A3KMMXLJFQENDZ,B000FAOC2M,Alex A. Fintonis,"[5, 6]","A horror film that truly repulsed me in a strong way, thank you very much, it's about time.  I have noticed the reviews of this film and people are either loving it or hating it.  This is not a huge surprise.  A lot of films have those types of reviews.  What surprised me was that the reviewers that hate it are people who are stating that the movie is too graphic in violence, gore and rape.  This tells me that the director pushed the envelope a bit further in the world of horror.  In my opinion this is a good thing.I understand that a horror movie just doesn't need to have strong gore and violence to be good and scary.  Tobe Hooper's Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of the classics in the genre and it had very little actual gore and blood.  That's part of the magic of Hooper's classic.  However, to all those people who think the rape scene was too much. I urge them to go and see the Exorcist again watch what Regan does with the crucifix.  That scene disturbed a lot of people, that whole movie disturbed people, and guess what it's considered classic.  It's right up there with Psycho.  Now I don't think that the Hills have Eyes remake is in quite the same caliber as the Exorcist.  But it's been a long time since I have watched a horror film and been either scared, shocked, disturbed, and repulsed.I would also like to say that I have a family and I have an 18-month-old baby so the whole idea of torturing and killing a child really turned my stomach.  But it really made me think and feel thankful that my son was safe at home. Watching this film I could really put myself in the main character's shoes.  I really felt for the victims.  This is first for me in a long time because for the most part when I am watching a slasher film I can't wait to see the victims who I can't stand get killed.This movie is about human instinct and survival, pure and simple.  If you put human beings in an extreme situation we can become wild animals who are fighting for survival, especially when we are protecting our children.  For quite a while I was getting pretty tired of ghost movies.  Films such as the Ring 1 and 2, the Grudge, the Others, Dark Water, and the Darkness were just dominating the world of horror.  This was fine for a while but the formula was getting old fast. Thanks to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake, Land of the Dead, Dawn of the Dead remake, Rob Zombie's two films and now the Hills have Eyes the horror scene is getting back to the basics again.  Thank you very much. I almost feel like it's the late 70s and early 80s all over again.

The movie is awesome. The family seems more real than ever...your typical Republican, huntin' family with the man of the house being the leader. The music was frightening- the torturous scenes just made your stomach twist and turn, and the acting was great. I saw it with my best friend and we both loved it. A great movie for a remake.Some of what made this movie exceptional: the script was well-written and convincing. The family was very realistic and seemed just like any other family we know.

986836,A4PTUEVFE13K6,B000FAOC2M,Allen Chapman,"[15, 20]","Apparently there are no original ideas for horror movies anymore. Lately every one that is coming out is a remake of a low budget 70's flick. ""The Hills Have Eyes"" is the latest. Speaking of which a preview for ""The Omen"" was shown at the start of the movie, clearly being remade for the once in a lifetime release date of 6/6/06. Anyhow I didn't expect much going into ""The Hills"" and didn't get much either. The plot is the standard horror plot, happy idiots unknowingly stumble upon a group of weirdos and the trouble begins. I realize this is just a movie and if people did anything smart there would be no movie in the first place, but when you are traveling thru the desert and you come across a toothless yokel, why would you take his advice for a ""shortcut"". That's just the first of many eye rolling moments. After that the stupidity of the characters just gets totally out of hand. Rather than being shocked when they get killed you find yourself wishing they would just kill them and get it over with. The whole thing is a mess.

They chose Alexandre Aja, and what they came up with was one of the scariest movies of 2006, perhaps THE scariest.  My review will be in two parts: the movie itself and the DVD special features.The Carter family is off on a road trip through the desert.  After stopping to get gas, the station attendant tells them of a pathway through the desert that will take them to the main highway and would cut a few hours off their time.  The Carters accept, not knowing that the route they would travel would take them through an area that had undergone heavy nuclear testing by the US Army years earlier- or that a family of settlers had survived the testing, but with less than desirable results: they are all now bloodthirsty mutants.  So the Carters move on- till a spikechain set in the road blows out all four of their tires.  They settle in while Big Bob goes to get help.  When night falls, the ""eyes"" open up- and that's where the fun begins.This being the Unrated Director's Cut, alot of material made it in that wasn't in the original R-rated theater version: the fight between Doug (Aaron Stafford) and Pluto was extended and some of the other fight scenes were added; one scene that was taken out, however, was the scene of Pluto siphoning gas from the family Jeep.  The DVD itself contains a behind the scenes look at the making of the movie called ""Surviving the Hills"", a music video for The Finalist's ""Leave the Broken Hearts"", and a few other extras like director and actor commentaries.The Ring?

How much more brutal and viscious could it get? Obviously it could. Alexander Aja, who's a kind of blood transfusion for a horror genre nowdays, drew general attention to himself with his almost recent ""Haute tension"" - uncompromising, challenging and extremely talented yet disputable to many thriller. Apparently everyone was waiting for his next turn especially if it was a well-known story - a remake of 1977 somewhat horror classic ""The Hills Have Eyes"" by Wes Craven. And if ""Haute tension"" was very brutal and rigorous, his next feature came out to be just atrocious. The story stayed practially the same only Aja ""slightly"" changed the overtones turning ""The Hills Have Eyes"" into often unbearable to watch chiller. The first half of the film is just slow and viscous, and as you know the plot and what's going to happen, it's almost a torture (in a good horror meaning) to wait for a pending and inevitable night attack. This couple of minutes before it, this serenity and stillness were a literal torture to me. And the blood bath that followed could shock even a long-term gorehounds. Aja included some novelties to the film compared to the original and it was for the good. The nuclear test calderas in the desert filled with old cars was a brilliant finding. Just by looking attentively at the cars you can paint a picture in your head of what was happening here during all those years. There's practically nothing shown, but you got yourself a material for another imaginary movie. Then I've seen few places in other movies that would look more sinister and evil than the military test-range city in ""The Hills..."". Old plywood houses with dummies of grown-ups and children are just a horror film themselves even without any massacre. The controversial rape scene was made just ingenious to my opinion. The way the mutant was taking away the blanket and looking at the girl, that look in his eyes... The thought this freak of a human can feel something of a sexual desire instead of just killing mindlessly everything that stands before him, fills a viewer with sheer repugnance, hence this rape scene being nowhere near too graphic is also unbearable to watch. There are some more details I won't be talking about - anyway if you liked ""Haute tension"", you'll immensely enjoy ""The Hills..."" Some say it makes ""Wrong Turn"" and ""Hostel"" look infantile. I wouldn't go that far to say it, but it definately in some ways is more fierce and dreadful. Also as in ""Haute tension"" Aja's music choice is just... I can't describe it, you have to see it with your own eyes and hear with your own ears - it just so crushes your psyche.My verdict - it's one of the best horror films of the last years if not THE best.",5,IF YOU HAVE EYES YOU HAVE TO SEE IT,1152403200,"07 9, 2006",2006,2818,"['have', 'seen', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacres', 'Wrong', 'Turn', 'Devil', 'Rejects', 'Wolf', 'Creek', 'How', 'much', 'more', 'brutal', 'viscious', 'could', 'get', 'Obviously', 'could', 'Alexander', 'Aja', 'who', 'kind', 'blood', 'transfusion', 'horror', 'genre', 'nowdays', 'drew', 'general', 'attention', 'almost', 'recent', 'Haute', 'tension', 'uncompromising', 'challenging', 'extremely', 'talented', 'yet', 'disputable', 'many', 'thriller', 'Apparently', 'everyone', 'was', 'waiting', 'next', 'turn', 'especially', 'was', 'well-known', 'story', 'remake', '1977', 'somewhat', 'horror', 'classic', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'Haute', 'tension', 'was', 'very', 'brutal', 'rigorous', 'next', 'feature', 'came', 'out', 'be', 'just', 'atrocious', 'story', 'stayed', 'practially', 'same', 'only', 'Aja', 'slightly', 'changed', 'overtones', 'turning', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'often', 'unbearable', 'watch', 'chiller', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'just', 'slow', 'viscous', 'know', 'plot', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'almost', 'torture', 'good', 'horror', 'meaning', 'wait', 'pending', 'inevitable', 'night', 'attack', 'couple', 'minutes', 'serenity', 'stillness', 'were', 'literal', 'torture', 'blood', 'bath', 'followed', 'could', 'shock', 'even', 'long-term', 'gorehounds', 'Aja', 'included', 'novelties', 'film', 'compared', 'original', 'was', 'good', 'nuclear', 'test', 'calderas', 'desert', 'filled', 'old', 'cars', 'was', 'brilliant', 'finding', 'Just', 'looking', 'attentively', 'cars', 'can', 'paint', 'picture', 'head', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'here', 'years', 'practically', 'nothing', 'shown', 'got', 'material', 'imaginary', 'movie', 'Then', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'few', 'places', 'other', 'movies', 'would', 'look', 'more', 'sinister', 'evil', 'military', 'test-range', 'city', 'Hills', 'Old', 'plywood', 'houses', 'dummies', 'grown-ups', 'children', 'are', 'just', 'horror', 'film', 'even', 'massacre', 'controversial', 'rape', 'scene', 'was', 'made', 'just', 'ingenious', 'opinion', 'way', 'mutant', 'was', 'taking', 'away', 'blanket', 'looking', 'girl', 'look', 'eyes', 'thought', 'freak', 'human', 'can', 'feel', 'something', 'sexual', 'desire', 'instead', 'just', 'killing', 'mindlessly', 'everything', 'viewer', 'sheer', 'repugnance', 'hence', 'rape', 'scene', 'being', 'nowhere', 'too', 'graphic', 'also', 'unbearable', 'watch', 'are', 'more', 'details', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'talking', 'anyway', 'liked', 'Haute', 'tension', ""'ll"", 'immensely', 'enjoy', 'Hills', 'say', 'Wrong', 'Turn', 'Hostel', 'look', 'infantile', 'would', ""n't"", 'go', 'far', 'say', 'definately', 'ways', 'more', 'fierce', 'dreadful', 'Also', 'Haute', 'tension', 'Aja', 'music', 'choice', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'describe', 'have', 'see', 'own', 'eyes', 'hear', 'own', 'ears', 'just', 'so', 'crushes', 'psyche.My', 'verdict', 'one', 'best', 'horror', 'films', 'last', 'years', 'not', 'THE', 'best']",The Hills Have Eyes

Fuchs, author of The Axiom-man Saga ""www...","[2, 2]","The story is simple: a family's off on a holiday and had taken a short cut through the desert to get there. In order to make the trip, they pull up to a lone gas station in the middle of nowhere to top up the tank. Problem is, the gas attendant is in on a little secret and points them to a ""short cut"" that's supposed to save them a couple hours. Instead, this ""short cut"" leads the family on the fast track to death as a pack of bloodthirsty mutants hunt the family as their next meal.No, really, that's the story. But you know what? I love it. Simple horror, straight and to the point. Here's the good guys, here's the bad guys, here's the setting. Let's see what happens. It works for me and it works for The Hills Have Eyes no problem. Unfortunately, I didn't see the 1977 original so I can't compare the two, but what I can tell you is the idea, as presented in the movie, of human-mutants caused by nuclear testing's radioactivity was done well, especially since the mutations aren't over the top but very believable (i.e. a guy with a big head; a little girl with a lopsided face; even the grossest of the bunch just seemed to have a few tumors the size of pool balls bulging under his skin).This movie started off with a quick action scene, then the credits rolled, and the main story got under way. Since we as the viewers knew this family was in jeopardy almost right from the start, the slow build-up leading to the explosion of danger and gore was well worth the wait. Actually, I'm glad there was a long lead up before things went crazy. Made you care and relate to the family first before things started happening to them. Made it all the more painful when they got killed.The one part that really got me jumping was the involvement of the baby who, it seemed, was around six months old. Being a parent, the thought of your child getting kidnapped is just terrifying. Add getting kidnapped by cannibal mutants to that and it really makes for sensitive watching. Every scene where I thought maybe something would happen to the kid, I was, like, ""No, not that baby!"" (What? Horror fans can't be sensitive?)The 180-degree character development of our hero, Doug Bukowski (Aaron Stanford) , was impressive especially since I really didn't like him at all in the beginning, which was the point, and which was a success on the part of the filmmakers.

986847,A19VMQDCB4HZ9P,B000FAOC2M,"A. Sandoc ""sussarakhen""","[85, 121]","I'm not much for remakes of film's that doesn't really require being remade. Some classic examples being Psycho, Dawn of the Dead and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remakes came to mind. Both Gus Van Sant's Psycho remake and the Michael Bay-produced Chainsaw remake were critical failures from both fans and critis alike. Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead remake only succeeded for the fact that it's more of a reimagining than a straight remake. The only thing that film had in common with Romero's classic was the location. Now we have another remake of a horror classic (though to some calling Craven's second film a classic might be somewhat of a stretch.) in the Alexandre Aja directed and Wes Craven produced The Hills Have Eyes. Aja's The Hills Have Eyes becomes the rare horror remake in that its more than a match to Wes Craven's original.Alexandre Aja first burst onto the horror-cinema scene with his ambitious and grisly homage to grindhouse horror: Haute Tension. Haute Tension was one nasty piece of horror filmmaking which brought to mind 70's and early 80's horror exploitation and grindhouse mentality. Aja's directorial debut was a no-hold-s-barred punch and kick to the stomach that was overtly violent and sublimely painful for the audience to watch. Aja was soon tapped by Wes Craven to lead the remake project of his own The Hills Have Eyes and to Aja's growing reputation as a master of horror, he grew as a filmmaker and more than earned this reputation. Aja's The Hills Have Eyes follows pretty much the very same story and characters as the original. This remake has abit more of a political sense to its storytelling in that it doesn't just pit the basic premise of civilized humans versus the primal inbred, mutant hill dweller, but also the different demographics of red state versus blue state. This theme was hammered through to the audience through the subsurface conflict between Big Bob Carter's (well-played by industry veteran Ted Levine) red state gung-ho ex-detective and his son-in-law Doug's (X2's Aaron Stafford) pacifist mentality. I think this new wrinkle in the original's sparse and tight story was unnecessary and unsubtly done. I really didn't want to know what political leanings and motivations the Carter family members followed. What I did care about was how they would react to the outside forces that was soon to menace and attack them.The first half of the film was very slow as it slowly built up the tension and dread as the Carter family's journey through a supposedly short-cut through the desert put them closer and closer to the dangerous people who dwelt amongst the desert hills bordering the desert road. Once the family becomes purposelly stranded in the middle of nowhere the fun begins for horror-aficionados. For those who have seen the original this remake doesn't deviate from the main story. The hill people who, up until now have only been glimpsed through quick shadowy movements across the screen, were the true cause of the family's predicament attack in a brutal and grisly fashion. None of the Carter family members were spared from this attack. From Big Bob Carter, his wife Ethel, their three children, son-in-law and young granddaughter they all suffer in one form or another. The night attack on the camper is the main highlight of the film and shows that Aja hasn't lost his touch for creating a cinematic setpiece that doesn't hold back. From the brutal rape of the Carter's youngest daughter Brenda to the sudden deaths of several Carter family members. This sequence was both fast-paced and chaotic in nature. It also helped push the definition of what constitute a very hard R-rating. Just like Zombie's The Devil's Rejects and Roth's Hostel, The Hills Have Eyes push the limits and boundaries of what the MPAA has allowed so far in terms of on-screen violence. I'm very surprised that some of the violence and deaths in this film made the final cut. This film definitely brings back the 70's style horror.The cast for this remake was one high point that the original didn't have. Where Craven had a very inexperienced cast for the original film, Aja had the luxury of a bigger budget to hire a more competent and able group of actors. A cast that was led by Ted Levine who shined in his role as the patriarch of the civilized Carters. Kathleen Quinlan as the mother of the bunch soldiers on even though its almost predestined in films such as this that she would be one of the doomed. The two daughters as played by Vinessa Shaw and Lost's Emilie De Ravin did extremely well in roles that involved some of the more graphic rape sequences put on film that wasn't from a film called Irreversible. Much kudos must go to De Ravin for having to perform through her scene during the trailer-camper attack. But the two actors who excelled in the film has to be pacifist turned avenging angel Doug as played by Aaron Stafford. We see in his character Doug the lenghts a civilized human being would go through to survive and protect those he cares for. Even if this means resorting to becoming more brutal and primal than the inbred, mutant hill dwellers. It's in Doug's character where the basic premise of the clash of the modern with the primitive comes close to matching the same theme in the original. To a smaller degree this was also echoed in the Carter's teenage son Bobby. Dan Byrd of Entourage plays Bobby Carter and its in him we see the level-headedness of the family. Despite all the horror and carnage he has seen the hill dwellers have inflicted on his family, Bobby remains somewhat calm and level-headed to protect what is left of his family. The only drawback as to the cast itself was that the opposing family seemed to have been shortchanged. In the original we actually got to understand some of the motivations that drove the hill dwellers to prey on unsuspecting travelers through their area. In this remake the hill dwellers seem more like superhuman monsters and boogeymen. It didn't bother me as much, but then it also lessened the impact of the story's basic premise of civilization versus primitives.Lastly, the look of the film helps add to the grindhouse nature of Aja's remake. The film has an oversaturated look and feel that took advantage of the desert location and the high-sun overhead. This oversaturation of the film's look also lends some credence to its grindhouse sensibilities. It looked, felt and acted like something made during the late 70's and early 80's. For most fans of horror it would really come down to the special-effects used to show the death and violence's impact on the audience. Once again, Greg Nicotero and his crew at KNB EFX house show that they're the premiere effects house. The make-up used to show the mutant effects on the survivors of the original inhabitants of the hills was excellently done. The same goes for the gags used to show the many brutal and messy deaths of both families. The level of violence in this film actually surpasses that of Roth's Hostel in terms of giving the audience that burst of adrenaline and also for making things look very painful. There's no denying that The Hills Have Eyes was all about pain when boiled down to its most basic denominator. This film is all about pushing the boundaries and piling on violence upon violence. The Hills Have Eyes is not a film that tells us violence solves nothing. Here it does solve the problem for the Carter clan and is also the only avenue of survival of the remaining Carters. The same goes for the nuclear survivors and their offspring who stayed in the irradiated zones that was their home. This film is all about survival and the levels and heights individuals would take to achieve it.In the end, Alexadre Aja has cemented himself as this generations premiere horror auteur. The Hills Have Eyes might not be the original second helping some have expected from Aja after his brilliant, if somewhat flawed first major film with Haute Tension, but it does show his growth as a filmmaker and his clean grasp of what makes horror cinema truly terrifying and uncomfortable. Two ingredients that makes for making a genre exploitation fare into something of a classic. I'm sure that outside of the horror-aficionado circles this film will either be met with indifference or disgust, but for those who revel in this type of filmmaking then it's a glorious continuation of the grindhouse horro revival that began with Aja's own Haute Tension, continued by Zombie's The Devil's Rejects and Roth's Hostel. It truly is a great time to be a fan of horror. And Aja's The Hills Have Eyes more than holds its own against Craven's original.",4,Aja's Hills is more than a match for Craven's,1142121600,"03 12, 2006",2006,8640,"[""'m"", 'not', 'much', 'remakes',

Well, that was sort of what happened, but the amount of violence and blood this movie offered was REALLY high and in some cases, REALLY disturbing.When the killing begins, the violence is out of this world.  Teenagers are forced to watch their parents and other family members die right in front of their eyes as they struggle to find a way to kill the disfigured people who, without warning, go on a killing spree.  They clearly have no sympathy at all.  The story changed direction after this one particular violent piece of film, and becomes more about searching the desert and trying to save the baby that one of the disfigured monsters took.The one guy in the film (the good guy) does everything in his power to escape the deadly attacks from the monsters and bring the baby back to the place where the other survivors were waiting for him to return, and you can't help but feel sorry for the guy because he always comes so close to dying but it never happens.I was really disturbed by the scenes that shown the teenagers putting their dead parents next to each other.  The emotions from the teens (a sister and brother) were believable.  After all, if you had to do the same thing, you would be completely devastated.I am still in shock how bloody the film turned out to be.

thought it was slightly better a new updated version reallyso this new HILLS HAVE EYES is a remake or new updated version of the 1977 HILLS HAVE EYESwhen the first HILLS HAVE EYES film was made it was 1976 released in theaters 1977there wasn't much film Technology around at the time for Wes craven's visionthat's why the film was made the way it is was made, they had to rely on Thrills and suspense, Terrorplus the film was made on very low Budget aswellplus the plot is slightly different to the new updated versionit's about a family of Cannibals who hide in the Hills in the Desert, they go and slaughter a familywho tries to drive through the Desert but gets strandedand that's basically it the film goes for about 90mins but the suspense is non stop from beginning to the endthis new remake that's also produced by Wes craven and peter Locke anywayso wes craven was supporting Alex Aja to make the film anyway.the plot is similar to the originalbut the family of Cannibals are survivors from a Nuclear bomb attack in the Desertthat was done during the 50'sthe Government were doing Nuclear testing in the Desert during the 50'sand a small town in the Desert got wiped out so the remaining survivors that had survived for Decadeswith Radiation poisoningand take revenge on American society and slaughter anybody that comes through the Desertso the family have been taking victims for many years and eating themso the new bred American family that gets attacked tries to hit back and take revenge on the Cannibals.but this new version was made with a bigger budget so it's a more Horrifying film reallyin your face Horror with Tons of blood and Gore, there are scenes of Body parts and Deformed Cannibalsso this new version still has tons of suspense and terror but with lots of Blood and Gore added to the mix.plus this new version is a bit longer, about 10-12mins longer than the 1977 versioncause the producers had more money to spend, that's the only reasonso it's about opinions, i do enjoy watching both versionswes craven is one of the producers of this new remake so i still enjoy watching his 1977 versionyou either prefer the original classic or prefer the remake or you like both.this blu-ray version is better than the dvd releasethis blu-ray has a new HD transfer that looks fantastic and the audio quality sounds amazingplus all the extras from the dvd release are on this

But I loved it. It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time; it was THAT exciting.

Of course not; this is horror, after all, and the more victims the better ...the more blood and guts the better.The actors were well-suited for the roles they played, but I felt let-down by the non-closure at the ending.

The characters, whether sympathetic or malevolent, are well presented. I definitely like the updated mutations. This clan of freakish murderers is pretty frightening!

I had previously read up on his prior effort, ""Haute Tension,"" within the gore-drenched pages of Fangoria magazine. While I still have yet to cast eyes upon that specific film, I have to say that his remake of Wes Craven's less-than-perfect 1977 schlocker, ""The Hills Have Eyes,""  kept me riveted to my chair with my heart racing full-throttle!Aja's pull-no-punches approach to Craven's narrative shoves the ""RESTRICTED"" rating far and beyond any line other films within this genre have ever crossed. This, along with Jon Leibesman's ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning,"" was one of the most unapologetically brutal horror movies I have ever paid to see on a movie screen. Aside from the annoying fact that all six of the spritely teenage girls sitting behind me in the theater spent three quarters of the film LAUGHING, I found this new take on ""Hills"" far more satisfying than any of the recent watered-down garbage Hollywood has been attempting to pass off as true horror. Looking for cutesy unnecessary humor or comic relief? Well, friends, it certainly ain't here! This was a refreshing long-needed breath of fresh air to a genre that has quickly and very unfortunately fallen into a realm of idiotic self-parody. Aja reminds us what it's like to be a true horror fan, injecting his film with equal amounts of moody tension, rapid-fire scares, and cinematography worthy of any major blockbuster. An exceptionally strong cast with actors who actually make us invest in what we're watching is another major plus. Of particular note are Ted Levine and Kathleen Quinlan, the parental figures, who both deliver outstanding performances that overwhelmingly surpass the usual cookie-cutter portrayals we're all accustomed to. Be sure and pay particular attention, as well, to Aaron Stanford. The sheer unrivaled hell his character, Doug, is forced to endure from the story's mid-point on really is nothing short of heart-stopping.This movie plain and simply has it all and the UNRATED DVD does it even more credit! The anamorphic widescreen transfer is crisp, accentuating Aja's deliberately over-saturated film stock to jaw-dropping effect. Extras include a commentary track with Aja, art director and co-writer Gregory Levasseur, and producer Marianne Maddalena. A second commentary track contains insight from producers Wes Craven and Peter Locke, both of whom ironically worked together previously on the 1977 original ""Hills."" You will also find an incredibly detailed behind-the-scenes featurette, ""Surviving The Hills,"" along with informative production diaries and a music video. This is definitely a worthwhile package for any devoted follower of blood-soaked horror, and one that you would certainly be unwise to pass up.

This is a remake of a 1977 film of the same name by Wes Craven. It was a gore-fest-crazy-people slasher then and is now.

The plot isn't great and neither is the movie.

Emilie plays a young mother in this movie, not a far cry from her Lost role, but she is wonderfull none the less. Of course my views of her skill may be skewed by the fact I think she is beautiful and she reminds me of a past girlfriend of mine, but I digress.

986863,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,B000FAOC2M,Carl Manes,"[0, 0]","Nearly thirty years after Wes Craven's shocking original, THE HILLS still HAVE EYES thanks to the 2006 remake from HIGH TENSION director Alexandre Aja. For modern audiences that have been raised on blood and gore, THE HILLS HAVE EYES is a worthy update that adds a whole new dimension of radioactive terror to the classic tale. The Carters are making their way out to California on the back roads of New Mexico, when a freak blowout leaves them stranded in the desert. While they are unable to find anyone in their search for help, someone sure finds them, and they enter a deadly struggle for survival with a wild pack of mutant cannibals! Aja knows what works, taking the most terrifying moments from the original and exploiting them with even more shocking sexuality and explosive violence. In a time when the MPAA controls had caused most other artists to self-censor their work, Aja stands strong and pushes the limits of acceptability on screen. The Moroccan locations that double for New Mexico are devastatingly beautiful and foreboding at the same time, making The Hills one of the most frightening characters in the movie. Although Michael Bailey Smith and Robert Joy are both very good as the two lead villains, they are unlikely to be remembered as much as Michael Berryman and Lance Gordon in their iconic roles. The Carters are excellently cast as well. Ted Levine takes over as Big Bob, the grumbling head of the family, and Dan Byrd puts in a great performance as young Bobby Carter. The anti-nuclear sentiment, on the other hand, is a bit irrelevant at this point, but it does not distract from the plot. With more killer make-up and bloody effects by the KNB group, THE HILLS HAVE EYES serves as a strong remake to the 1977 cult classic.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",4,ILHM Reviews The Hills Have Eyes,1359763200,"02 2, 2013",2013,1786,"['Nearly', 'thirty', 'years', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'shocking', 'original', 'THE', 'HILLS', 'still', 'HAVE', 'EYES', 'thanks', '2006', 'remake', 'HIGH', 'TENSION', 'director', 'Alexandre', 'Aja', 'modern', 'audiences', 'have', 'been', 'raised', 'blood', 'gore', 'THE', 'HILLS', 'HAVE', 'EYES', 'worthy', 'update', 'whole', 'new', 'dimension', 'radioactive', 'terror', 'classic', 'tale', 'Carters', 'are', 'making', 'way', 'California', 'back', 'roads', 'New', 'Mexico', 'when', 'freak', 'blowout', 'stranded', 'desert', 'are', 'unable', 'find', 'anyone', 'search', 'help', 'someone', 'sure', 'enter', 'deadly', 'struggle', 'survival', 'wild', 'pack', 'mutant', 'cannibals', 'Aja', 'what', 'taking', 'most', 'terrifying', 'moments', 'original', 'exploiting', 'even', 'more', 'shocking', 'sexuality', 'explosive', 'violence', 'time', 'when', 'MPAA', 'controls', 'had', 'caused', 'most', 'other', 'artists', 'self-censor', 'work', 'Aja', 'strong', 'limits', 'acceptability', 'screen', 'Moroccan', 'locations', 'double', 'New', 'Mexico', 'are', 'devastatingly', 'beautiful', 'foreboding', 'same', 'time', 'making', 'Hills', 'one', 'most', 'frightening', 'characters', 'movie', 'Michael', 'Bailey', 'Smith', 'Robert', 'Joy', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'two', 'lead', 'villains', 'are', 'unlikely', 'be', 'remembered', 'as', 'much', 'Michael', 'Berryman', 'Lance', 'Gordon', 'iconic', 'roles', 'Carters', 'are', 'excellently', 'cast', 'as', 'well', 'Ted', 'Levine', 'over', 'as', 'Big', 'Bob', 'grumbling', 'head', 'family', 'Dan', 'Byrd', 'great', 'performance', 'young', 'Bobby', 'Carter', 'anti-nuclear', 'sentiment', 'other', 'hand', 'bit', 'irrelevant', 'point', 'not', 'distract', 'plot', 'more', 'killer', 'make-up', 'bloody', 'effects', 'KNB', 'group', 'THE', 'HILLS', 'HAVE', 'EYES', 'strong', 'remake', '1977', 'cult', 'classic.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",The Hills Have Eyes

Most of the Horror out today is about 90% blood and guts 9% shotty camera work and 1% plot. Gone are the days of letting your imagination run wild, where the horror was about the unknown and the big scares came at the beginning and the end. The build up was most of the thrill and the Gore was never the star, it was always the icing on the cake.The Hills Have Eyes, written by Alexandre Aja (haute tension) and Wes Craven is supposed to be about a family that gets waylaid in the unfortunate vicinity of a nuclear test sight. There are people (mutants) who never left the doomed town and still live there in the ""hills"" and murder whoever comes near them, the reasoning being they are peeved at the government and are hungry I guess. The older version was cheesy, but entertaining none the less. We craven hasn't shelled out a good horror movie since A Nightmare on Elm street and that was in 1984, I am starting to think it was a fluke. Everything since then has been tame at best, poorly executed and disappointing ( Scream, Red eye, Cursed, Vampire in Brooklyn, Shocker, Dracula 2000, Pulse, Freddy vs. Jason, They) Most of those films are comedies (which I can appreciate) , not Horror. And Alexandre Aja's best film Haute Tension was a good film until the last 20 minutes.This Film, is supposed to have shock value and for what it's worth it isn't that shocking. The term ""been there done that"" comes to mind. The mutated townsfolk were shallowly fleshed out character wise, mostly they reminded me of Sloth from the Goonies and recent zombie films, in fact the main mutant Lizard is played by Robert Joy who was in Land of the Dead, and Micheal Bailey Smith who played Pluto was a Hillbilly mutant in the straight to DVD movie Monster Man. The Family, who is stupid enough to take an air stream through a shortcut across the desert, really deserves to be weeded out by cannibal radiation sick murderers. Personally I didn't care about their well being, I wasn't inclined by the plotline to like them at all, especially their dogs. I have a short fuse for dogs that aren't on a leash and just run amok at every chance they get. That brings me to the kills, the dog looked fake fake fake, stiff as a board and only minutes dead!?! The father being burnt alive looked so eye rolling fake, the shooting of the mother, who cared? The Nursing on the older daughter, unnecessary!!!  Random thought....Who brings a bird on a road trip? Don't these people have neighbors? I have seen reviews on here about how ""terrifying"" it was, WHERE? Was it scary that they took the baby? Or that the Liberal gun shy son in law was about to get whacked? Was I shaking when Mut #4 wailed in his wheelchair about his life, or when Mut #5 and 6 played in their rooms with burnt up dolls? I was terrified that people actually got scared or jumped watching this! NOTHING was worthy in this so called film to be called terrifying, Nothing. It was Gore for the sake of grossness, sexual for the sake of grossness, Hair and makeup and CGI effects for the sake of Grossness, and these people got your 9 bucks at the box office and 14.99 at Best Buy because the general public thinks Gross = Terrifying.I predict this method of filmmaking has one more year left in it, because there are only so many intestines, scalpels, torture devices, and dumb people who travel in the path of some crazed murderous hillbilly that people can take.",1,The Hills have Zzzzzz's,1167177600,"12 27, 2006",2006,3600,"['torture', 'movies', 'there', 'Saw', 'Hostel', 'Wolf', 'Creek', 'Turistas', 'etc', 'should', 'have', 'expected', 'remake', '1979', 'Version', 'would', 'also', 'have', 'lots', 'blood', 'substance', 'Most', 'Horror', 'today', 'about', '90', '%', 'blood', 'guts', '9', '%', 'shotty', 'camera', 'work', '1', '%', 'plot', 'Gone', 'are', 'days', 'letting', 'imagination', 'run', 'wild', 'where', 'horror', 'was', 'unknown', 'big', 'scares', 'came', 'beginning', 'end', 'build', 'up', 'was', 'most', 'thrill', 'Gore', 'was', 'never', 'star', 'was', 'always', 'icing', 'cake.The', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'written', 'Alexandre', 'Aja', 'haute', 'tension', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'supposed', 'be', 'family', 'waylaid', 'unfortunate', 'vicinity', 'nuclear', 'test', 'sight', 'are', 'people', 'mutants', 'who', 'never', 'left', 'doomed', 'town', 'still', 'live', 'there', 'hills', 'murder', 'whoever', 'reasoning', 'being', 'are', 'peeved', 'government', 'are', 'hungry', 'guess', 'older', 'version', 'was', 'cheesy', 'entertaining', 'none', 'less', 'craven', ""n't"", 'shelled', 'out', 'good', 'horror', 'movie', 'A', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'street', 'was', '1984', 'am', 'starting', 'think', 'was', 'fluke', 'Everything', 'then', 'been', 'tame', 'best', 'poorly', 'executed', 'disappointing', 'Scream', 'Red', 'eye', 'Cursed', 'Vampire', 'Brooklyn', 'Shocker', 'Dracula', '2000', 'Pulse', 'Freddy', 'vs.', 'Jason', 'Most', 'films', 'are', 'comedies', 'can', 'appreciate', 'not', 'Horror', 'Alexandre', 'Aja', 'best', 'film', 'Haute', 'Tension', 'was', 'good', 'film', 'last', '20', 'minutes.This', 'Film', 'supposed', 'have', 'shock', 'value', 'what', ""n't"", 'shocking', 'term', 'been', 'there', 'done', 'mind', 'mutated', 'townsfolk', 'were', 'shallowly', 'fleshed', 'out', 'character', 'wise', 'mostly', 'reminded', 'Sloth', 'Goonies', 'recent', 'zombie', 'films', 'fact', 'main', 'mutant', 'Lizard', 'played', 'Robert', 'Joy', 'who', 'was', 'Land', 'Dead', 'Micheal', 'Bailey', 'Smith', 'who', 'played', 'Pluto', 'was', 'Hillbilly', 'mutant', 'straight', 'DVD', 'movie', 'Monster', 'Man', 'Family', 'who', 'stupid', 'enough', 'take', 'air', 'stream', 'shortcut', 'desert', 'really', 'be', 'weeded', 'out', 'cannibal', 'radiation', 'sick', 'murderers', 'Personally', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'well', 'being', 'was', ""n't"", 'inclined', 'plotline', 'like', 'especially', 'dogs', 'have', 'short', 'fuse', 'dogs', 'are', ""n't"", 'leash', 'just', 'run', 'amok', 'chance', 'get', 'kills', 'dog', 'looked', 'fake', 'fake', 'fake', 'stiff', 'board', 'only', 'minutes', 'dead', 'father', 'being', 'burnt', 'alive', 'looked', 'so', 'eye', 'rolling', 'fake', 'shooting', 'mother', 'who', 'cared', 'Nursing', 'older', 'daughter', 'unnecessary', 'Random', 'thought', '.Who', 'bird', 'road', 'trip', 'Do', ""n't"", 'people', 'have', 'neighbors', 'have', 'seen', 'reviews', 'here', 'how', 'terrifying', 'was', 'WHERE', 'Was', 'scary', 'took', 'baby', 'Liberal', 'gun', 'shy', 'son', 'law', 'was', 'get', 'whacked', 'Was', 'shaking', 'when', 'Mut', '4', 'wailed', 'wheelchair', 'life', 'when', 'Mut', '5', '6', 'played', 'rooms', 'burnt', 'up', 'dolls', 'was', 'terrified', 'people', 'actually', 'got', 'scared', 'jumped', 'watching', 'NOTHING', 'was', 'worthy', 'so', 'called', 'film', 'be', 'called', 'terrifying', 'Nothing', 'was', 'Gore', 'sake', 'grossness', 'sexual', 'sake', 'grossness', 'Hair', 'makeup', 'CGI', 'effects', 'sake', 'Grossness', 'people', 'got', '9', 'bucks', 'box', 'office', '14.99', 'Best', 'Buy', 'general', 'public', 'Gross', '=', 'Terrifying.I', 'predict', 'method', 'filmmaking', 'one', 'more', 'year', 'left', 'are', 'only', 'so', 'many', 'intestines', 'scalpels', 'torture', 'devices', 'dumb', 'people', 'who', 'travel', 'path', 'crazed', 'murderous', 'hillbilly', 'people', 'can', 'take']",The Hills Have Eyes

986869,A31ATJR2RAVD5G,B000FAOC2M,Christopher Engel,"[1, 2]","Really, this movie is just about a mindless group of freaks deformed by radiation and totally insane (yet somehow surprisingly intelligent, all things considered) killing a bunch of people trapped in the desert. There's lots of people getting shot, stabbed, axed, and also one very brief but pretty tepid rape scene that doesn't really mean anything, and you probably won't care for. It's not like I expect ""I Spit On Your Grave"" or ""Last House on the Left"" every time there's a rape scene in a film, but this just feels like it was thrown in there for no real reason except for shock value, which it doesn't even deliver. The premise itself isn't great as far as gorefests go; people who got radiation poisoning live in a wasteland where there's no law and a lot of homicide. The villains are just generic deformed freaks with little intelligence and lots of homicidal mania, kinda like monsters that can talk but never say anything worthwhile, so it's not really a big victory when one of them gets an axe in the face by the justifiably angry protagonists. You really don't care when any of them die; they're all interchangeable, really. They're not exactly killing the top of the crop when it comes to homicidal maniacs; they're basically killing animals, only these aren't animals you have any reason to feel sorry for, what with the trapping these people and then trying to kill them thing.But, you know, if all you want is a gorefest and really don't care about the plot at all, this does have that down well. Tons of limbs are thrown everywhere, digits, decapitations, shotgun suicides, incinerations, various mutilations, and a variety of other gruesome things happen with a good deal of violent graphics. Blood is on the screen constantly, and someone or something is getting killed in almost every scene. If that's all you care about on a boring evening with nothing else to watch and just feel like a bloody horror film without needing to pay attention to a single sentence of the story, this is your ticket.I never saw the original, so I can't compare, but I doubt a film from a director as competent as him could make something this shallow and trite. He wasn't exactly about gore as much as the context of that gore, so that when things happened, it meant something, and you felt emotionally stirred by more than just how much blood was on screen at once. That's definitely not the case here. This is just body after body getting slain somehow in some gory fashion, and you'll be lucky to remember a single character's name by the end. I couldn't have cared less about the protagonists, since they're all cardboard cut-outs with little going for them besides being the unfortunate protagonists stuck in the mess they happen to end up in. The performances aren't anything special, not even by Kathleen Quinlan (Event Horizon), who got seriously short-changed here with a relatively minor role and not a lot of screen time, despite being the best actor they've got there. No one else is particularly convincing when it comes to expressing terror and vengeful retribution. No Oscar performances here.The bottom line is that if you want gore without any actual story value, here you go. It's all there, and you'll get plenty of blood and gore, if you crave that kind of thing. If you want a horror film with any meaning, though, don't bother. This is a mindless gorefest with nothing else going for it besides how red the screen is all the time.",2,A pretty standard gorefest.

Not that I get scared easily, it's just I prefer well-acted dramas with solid characters. Seeing people getting eaten or dismembered or bludgeoned to me isn't a movie, it's just an excuse to try and disgust the audience and not frighten them. Well in a sea of half-baked(if that) remakes, in comes the Hills Have Eyes, which does show off neat effects but it's got a very thin story and a feeling of gore for gore's sake.A family vacationing out in Western United States hits a bit of a problem and they have to stop in the middle of nowhere with no cell phone reception and no help. That's not the least of their worries as surrounding them are disfigured mutants who have a very strong affinity for blood and flesh. The only solution is to be just as violent to them back, maybe even moreso.You know a film is in trouble when the only discussed thing is the gore and the film has plenty. Fingers get cut off, axes go into bodies, heads are shot(and shot off) and there's most likely more but I can't remember off the top of my head. Now, maybe I've seen my share of gory movies or maybe it's just that I've been oversaturated with it but honestly it didn't affect me. First, films can't stand alone on gore, unless you count those equally pointless gore films like Cannibal Holocaust and such. And second, when the film's chockful of it it deadens the impact of subsequent ones, no matter how violent it is.Does the film succeed at least on some level? Well it's well-shot, giving the film that weird quasi-70's look, also reminiscent of the recent Devil's Rejects(which I hated too). The acting for the most part is alright, nothing stands out, although I didn't actually know Pyro from X2 and X3 was in this movie.

986872,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B000FAOC2M,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[38, 40]","This past weekend I saw film critic Roger Ebert and the other guy he does a show with talking about the worst films of 2006 (so far), and one of them on their list was The Hills Have Eyes (2006), which is actually a remake of a 1977 movie made by Wes Craven.  Roger's biggest gripe seemed to be the film was too `by the numbers' (it is a remake), and he would have preferred more character development in the antagonists (Roger, they're radiated, grotesque, cannibalistic mutants...what else do you need to know?).  Co-written and directed by Alexandre Aja (High Tension), the film features Dan Byrd (A Cinderella Story), Emilie de Ravin (""Roswell"", ""Lost""), Aaron Stanford (X-Men: The Last Stand), Kathleen Quinlan (Lawn Dogs), Ted Levine (Heat, ""Monk""), and Vinessa Shaw (Corky Romano).  Also appearing is Tom Bower (Die Hard 2), Robert Joy (Land of the Dead), Desmond Askew (""Roswell""), and Billy Drago (The Untouchables, Freeway).The movie begins by telling us that between 1945 and 1962 the United States performed over three hundred atmospheric nuclear tests in the American southwest, and has yet to own up to the possibility of any negative genetic effects that may have resulted.  Soon after we see some gooberment men in radiation suits performing various radiation checks in a desert in New Mexico, only to get seriously jacked by someone with a pickaxe.  Following this bit of nastiness we see a large family traveling cross-country through the desert, stopping off at a dilapidated filling station in the middle of nowhere.  There's Big Bob (Levine), his wife Ethel (Quinlan), their children Bobby (Byrd), Brenda (de Ravin), and Lynn (Shaw), her husband Doug (Stanford), their baby Catherine, two German Shepherds, two parakeets, and a partridge in a pear tree (a decent sized pool of potential victims is always appreciated)...anyhow, the old man (Bower), working the service station, lets Big Bob in on a shortcut, one that turns out to be anything but as Bob ends up crashing his Suburban into a giant rock after a mysterious blowout of all four tires.  Big Bob and Doug try to go for help, each going in separate directions.  Soon after Doug returns (he came up empty), the unpleasantness begins...you see, these here deserts are populated not only by snakes, coyotes, and scorpions, but also by hideously deformed, homicidal mutants with a hankering for fresh meat and a penchant for violence.  Things get particularly nasty as Big Bob returns (sort of), comely Brenda makes some new friends, Bobby freaks out, some characters bow out of the production, and the mutants abscond with Catherine (babies are good eatin', I guess).  As those remaining try to pull it together (the mutants said they'd be back), Doug, armed with a bitey dog and a baseball bat, goes off in search of Catherine and ends up finding a whole mess of trouble as he makes his way to mutant central...Overall I thought this remake a very slick and intense entry in the survival horror genre, one that does get extremely messy at times, so if you can't stomach scene of extreme violence (the piercing of flesh with sharp implements, blood spurting, etc.), you might want to skip this movie (the unrated version has like two extra minutes of violence, bits originally cut to secure an `R' rating).  One aspect I liked is the movie seemed to try and stay true to Craven's original, while adding a lot of extra material in terms of the mutants (here we get more of a back story as to who they were and how they came about).  There were a couple of parts that did bug me though, the first being when Big Bob and Doug are preparing to go for help.  Big Bob, a former police detective, gives Bobby a gun (supposedly Bobby's been trained in the use of firearms), and Bobby proceeds to joking point the gun at Doug.  Now I've never handled a firearm, but I do know one thing...you never point a loaded weapon at someone unless you're willing to shoot them (I don't care if the safety is on).  Not only that, but no one said anything, especially not Big Bob, who wasn't all that fond of Doug, but still...the other bit that annoyed me was when Big Bob got to the filling station and some stuff went down.  At one point he begins firing blindly into the dark, which seemed really stupid and a waste of valuable ammunition, especially given he was supposed to be a hardened veteran of some police force...oh well...I did learn a number of things from this film including the following...1. There are no shortcuts in the desert.2. There's a real shortage of non-radiated, hot, young women out in the desert, making them extremely coveted.3. Babies are juicy.4. Desert mutants can imitate dog sounds really well.5. Whiny cell phone salesmen are a lot tougher than I would have thought.6. There are some serious economic opportunities to be had in opening a dentistry practice in the desert.7. Dogs desire payback just as much as humans.8. While years of exposure to atomic radiation can make you deformed and ugly as sin, it can also make you ridiculously strong and difficult to kill.9. Bobby can't shoot for spit.10. Doug, the guy who hates guns, wields that boomstick like a pro.11. Nuclear test houses built by the military aren't all that solid.12. Movie dogs will run off every chance they get.13. Chevrolet Suburbans are quite roomy, enough so to store a few corpses.14. Desert mutants are well organized.15. Bobby might be able to run faster if he pulled his damn pants up.16. Doug stole that `feigning helplessness and then jabbing a sharp implement in the foot of your attacker' bit from the movie True Romance (1993).I thought all the performers did well, and I really liked how once things got going, the action rarely let up.  I didn't really get too much into the amount of violence or many of the specifics within my review as not to spoil any of the shocks for those who haven't had a chance to watch the film, but know things do get nasty.  I did see a few scenes taken from other films (besides the original film) scattered throughout, possibly indicating the writers influences, and perhaps they could have done a better job in not making their usage as obvious as it was, but then again the movie industry tends to be in the business of recycling, so it's probably best not to get too hung up on this aspect.The picture quality, presented in widescreen (2.35:1) anamorphic looks very sharp and the Dolby Digital 5.1 surround audio comes through clearly (it's also available in Spanish Dolby Digital Surround 2.0).  Included are English, Spanish, and French subtitles, a commentary track with co-writer/director Alexandre Aja, art director/co-writer Gr&eacute;gory Levasseur, and producer Marianne Maddalena, a second commentary track with producers Wes Craven and Peter Locke (both of whom behind the original film), a `making of' featurette titled `Surviving the Hills', production diaries, and a music video for the song `Leave the Broken Hearts', by The Finalist.Cookieman108By the way, I saw on the IMDb that Alexandre Aja is signed up to make a sequel to this movie, scheduled for a 2007 release...I hope it turns out better than the sequel for the original film.",4,"""There ain't nuthin' to see in the desert.""",1153180800,"07 18, 2006",2006,7163,"['past', 'weekend', 'saw', 'film', 'critic', 'Roger',

986874,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B000FAOC2M,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[3, 5]","Alexandre Aja has cemented himself in the horror history books with this one, perfecting horror for the world to see.  `The Hills Have Eyes' is one of the most brutal and disturbing horror films I've ever seen, and it executes itself brilliantly, never falling into stupidity or clich&eacute; but always keeping it's edge and holding our interest.  The film follows a family on their vacation as they are savaged by a group of, um, savages in the desert.What makes this movie so great is that unlike most horror films the acting here is as convincing as it should be, every moment truly terrifying and emotionally draining.  I say emotionally draining and I mean it.  This is one of the first horror films where I actually felt sympathy for the victims.  This family is tortured and mutilated one by one and it's actually more than just disturbing...it's heartbreaking.Done properly and brilliantly, Alexandre Aja has delivered to us a masterpiece in the horror genre.  The best acting here comes on the part of Dan Byrd and Emilie de Ravin who play siblings Bobby and Brenda Carter.  They portray the perfectly dysfunctional teens, provoking each other at random, but when disaster strikes and they are all each other has they come together and step up to plate.This film is definitely not one for the faint of heart.  It contains plenty of scenes that have the potential to make you emotionally distraught, make you squirm or maybe even a little sick.  There's a horrific rape scene, that while it may not be shown in entirety or even confirmed, it's implied heavily and beings that the victim is only around sixteen it makes it all the more disturbing.  The life of an infant is threatened numerous times and then there are some very disturbing images, some of which just involve the sight of these mutants.  (as a side note, Judith Jane Vallette and Adam Perrell as the deformed children are quite effective.)Great film, great time, great execution...`The Hills Have Eyes' is one for the textbooks.",4,The hills have eyes...and teeth and claws and lots of blood...,1160438400,"10 10, 2006",2006,2002,"['Alexandre', 'Aja', 'cemented', 'horror', 'history', 'books', 'one', 'perfecting', 'horror', 'world', 'see', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'one', 'most', 'brutal', 'disturbing', 'horror', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'brilliantly', 'never', 'falling', 'stupidity', 'clich', 'eacute', 'always', 'keeping', 'edge', 'holding', 'interest', 'film', 'family', 'vacation', 'are', 'savaged', 'group', 'um', 'savages', 'desert.What', 'movie', 'so', 'great', 'most', 'horror', 'films', 'acting', 'here', 'as', 'convincing', 'should', 'be', 'moment', 'truly', 'terrifying', 'emotionally', 'draining', 'say', 'emotionally', 'draining', 'mean', 'one', 'first', 'horror', 'films', 'where', 'actually', 'felt', 'sympathy', 'victims', 'family', 'tortured', 'mutilated', 'one', 'one', 'actually', 'more', 'just', 'disturbing', 'heartbreaking.Done', 'properly', 'brilliantly', 'Alexandre', 'Aja', 'delivered', 'masterpiece', 'horror', 'genre', 'best', 'acting', 'here', 'part', 'Dan', 'Byrd', 'Emilie', 'de', 'Ravin', 'who', 'play', 'siblings', 'Bobby', 'Brenda', 'Carter', 'portray', 'perfectly', 'dysfunctional', 'teens', 'provoking', 'other', 'random', 'when', 'disaster', 'strikes', 'are', 'other', 'come', 'together', 'step', 'up', 'plate.This', 'film', 'definitely', 'not', 'one', 'faint', 'heart', 'plenty', 'scenes', 'have', 'potential', 'make', 'emotionally', 'distraught', 'make', 'squirm', 'maybe', 'even', 'little', 'sick', 'horrific', 'rape', 'scene', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'shown', 'entirety', 'even', 'confirmed', 'implied', 'heavily', 'beings', 'victim', 'only', 'around', 'sixteen', 'more', 'disturbing', 'life', 'infant', 'threatened', 'numerous', 'times', 'then', 'are', 'very', 'disturbing', 'images', 'just', 'involve', 'sight', 'mutants', 'side', 'note', 'Judith', 'Jane', 'Vallette', 'Adam', 'Perrell', 'deformed', 'children', 'are', 'quite', 'effective', 'Great', 'film', 'great', 'time', 'great', 'execution', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'one', 'textbooks']",The Hills Have Eyes
986875,AILBDL6ATVDCJ,B000FAOC2M,"Dan Blankenship ""Author of THE RUNNING GIRL""","[3, 6]","My video store only had the unrated version available to rent:This is indeed a good horror movie, but the unrated version takes the rape scenes a little too far.  I found that part of the film to be quite disturbing.But if one skips through that part or gets the rated version, I think this film has enough guts, gore, and ""jump out of your seat"" moments to warrant a 4-star rating.Michael Bailey Smith, a former Dallas Cowboy, is a very good bad guy, if that makes any sense.  He plays Pluto (big deformed monster guy who kills people with an axe) in the movie, and this guy's film career is as long as list of failed writings.  He's been in around 70 films or more!  He doesn't have a lot of dialogue in this one though.Tom Bower (118 films this guy has done) plays the creepy gas station attendant who offers the traveling family a very bad shortcut on their trip.  Even though his part was very small, he really managed to make it very memorable.Ted Levine plays Big Bob, the father of a family who ends up wishing he hadn't taken that shortcut, or for that matter, taken them on this long and very dangerous adventure in the desert.  He doesn't have a long shelf life in the film, but I think he did a fantastic job with what he had to work with.Kathleen Quinlan plays the wife (Ethel) of Big Bob, and she is impressive as the woman trying to hold her family together as they seem to be growing apart; as most families eventually do.Dan Byrd plays Bobby, a kid who has to learn to grow up quite fast on this vacation from Hell.  I think I remember this kid from a ""Joan of Arcadia"" show.  He makes the transition from scared youth to angry revenge seeker quite well.  The scene where he hugs his sister when she begins weeping is one of the most memorable scenes in the film.  His sister had been through enough to drive anyone insane.  She needed to know someone was there to protect her and help her, and Bobby let her know he was.  Yep, best part of the movie, by far!Emilie de Ravin plays Bobby's sister, Brenda, and she is amazingly convincing throughout the entire film.  Because her character was so likable, believable, and human, the rape scene (hopefully not present in the rated version) is almost unbearable.  Her role in this film made the film work.Aaron Stanford is the liberal turned sadistic, revenge seeking Republican (LOL, I'm joking) who decided it is time to get his kidnapped baby back and start swinging axes at the bad guys.  He is good, but in no way is he as good in the film as de Raven.

986876,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000FAOC2M,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 1]","Do you enjoy watching a typical family being hunted down, killed, and at least partially eaten?  Does your heart go all a-flutter at the sight of a giant axe being buried in someone's head?  Do you get weak in the knees when some horribly mutated human monster flashes his viscous orbital sockets at you?  Do you wake up each and every morning chanting Gore Gore Gore?  If you answered Yes to any of these questions, you'll take evil delight in this remake of Wes Craven's classic The Hills Have Eyes.I have to admit that, at least for me, the shine of these mutant-led massacre films has pretty much worn off.  There's really nothing new here at all.  It's really just a question of how gory the director will make it.  It's not like the film is going to draw you into a juicy story, as that story consists of nothing more than a family being thrown out in the desert on some pretense and having to fight for their lives against mutant freaks.  There isn't even any mystery as to who the monsters are or how they got that way, as that's made pretty clear from the very start.As for all the gore, it's really quite exceptional, especially in this uncut version.  When a guy blows his head off with a shotgun, he really blows his head off with a shotgun.  All of the bullets that hit their mark do all kinds of damage.  Still, there's really nothing like a good axe blow to the skull, and the director seems to really get off on that sort of thing as he gives us plenty of it.  I could complain about the whole lack of brain oozing in conjunction with all the Bunyan Blues being whacked out, but at least there's plenty of blood.  While this isn't the goriest movie I've ever seen - not even close, really - it's definitely up there in the upper echelon of gruesome motion pictures.  The special effects aim high and hit the mark, as well; the mutated human degenerates cover a wide spectrum of radiation-induced ooziness, deformity, and general ugliness.The cast is quite good, as well.  Lost's Emilie De Ravin, who must by now have trouble convincing anyone to take even a short trip with her anywhere, is the most familiar face in the bunch - her screaming could use a little work, but she may have just found herself all screamed out after all the indignities and suffering she had to endure over the course of this film.  Aaron Stanford successfully moves beyond his general dweebiness to make a man out of his less than macho character, while young Bobby (Dan Byrd) never lets himself fall prey to the stereotype of the teenaged hero wannabe.If you're going to make a completely unnecessary remake, you'd better do it right - and that is just what happened here.  Just take a look at some of the critical reviews, decrying the bloodlust fueling such degenerate movies as this, even going as far as to call the moviemakers ""ghouls"" feeding on the blood money of viewers who will supposedly go out and do violent things to one another after the end credits roll.  As for reports of some viewers walking out on the film due to the level of violence - I don't get that at all.  Uh, did they walk into the wrong cinema or something?  It's not like The Hills Have Eyes was advertised as some sweeping romantic epic.  And I just don't think there's an outrageous level of violence here in the first place.  We spend a lot of time with an annoying family before the fun even begins.  And the rape scene?  Extremely tame, so much so that I wasn't completely sure it was actually a rape scene.  I also thought the director held back quite a bit on the whole cannibalism thing.  Really, as a hardcore horror fan, I find it amusing that some people consider this a shocking, ultra-violent film.

Expedia, anyone?2)When deciding on that super-duper shortcut, it's probably best not to take the advice of the jittery, twitching gas-station attendant on the Road to Nowhere who has no front teeth and carries a sawed-off shotgun in his butt-crack baring Husky 910s.3)When you break down in the middle of sweltering Hell (ie, the Nuclear Test Range), it's probably not a great idea to ""Split Up, so we can get help faster"".4) If you ever, ever, even remotely consider taking a shortcut through the abandoned US Nuclear Test Range, you should probably have a small arsenal with you, including sharpened sticks, Steyr AUG Assault Rifles, black talon ammunition, and maybe a tac-nuke. You can never be *too* prepared.5)If you're trusting your life and family to Dad, is it such a good idea when Dad (Ted Levine) is the gender-bending serial killer Buffalo Bill from ""Silence of the Lambs""? Isn't that what some would call a ""very f*cking bad start""?6) You're the Kid (Dan Byrd). You decide to let your pet German Shepherds go play around in the Hills of the Nuclear Test Range. One of them gets slaughtered: not killed, dude, I mean gutted, ripped wide open, e-f*cking-viscerated. Is it really a good idea to keep that on the down-low, because you're afraid of frightening the women-folk?7) If you're a Cannibal Mutant, it's probably best to have a battle plan. Radios are good. Planning in advance is wayyyyy better.8) More to the point, if you think the Victims might have a shot at getting all froggy on y'all, mebbe it's a good idea to break out the barbecue sauce and have a little Filet-o-Baby early on. You dig? Killing fat suburbanites is always easier on a full stomach.9)""The Hills Have Eyes"" has one seriously kick-a** sequence, which opens up with a bunch of hapless nuclear engineers and a big guy with a pick-axe. Oh, and the credits rule. Once you've seen that, you can switch the thing off and call it a day. Seriously: you'll thank me later.10) Hey, cheap Political Points made here! Vengeful, grieving family-member spikes a mutant through the skull with an American flag. Symbolism? You be the judge. Alexandre Aja is French. Go figure.If you're gonna remake a classic---even a boring classic---you better have something new to say. Aja, and ""Hills 2006"", does not.

One sad thing was that in the 70's he did not have the budget that he has now-a-days and he had to settle for some poor quality lighting,speacial effects and the most important ... run time (How long the movie is), though sometimes I do love low-budget horror films I really think that if he would have had a budget he could have added a better ending to the film, thats one thing that Aja did make sure to improve one, the ending, he added quite a bit of time in the new one to have a few more effective closing scenes.Aja did what i think all remakes should do which was(1) Follow the original's plot closely.(2) Make the Reamke more technoligiclly advanced(3) Dont Change the Charactors from the original(4) Dont Change the EndingNow in my veiw point Aja did all of that but the last one,... he had a better ending!The only thing that I personally did not like in the remake is that they made the people eaters villian guys looking corny cheesy and more than a little stupid, I think it would have been more scary if they would have had the same kind of people from the original, now those guys were creepy.... but hell lots of others disagree with that... just an opinionOverall I think that both the original and the remake are both very good and would recomment them to all horror fans, do keep in mind that this film is very bloody and is ""R"" border line ""NC-17"", (DONT PAY ATTINTION TO THE NC-17 RATING ON THIS WEBPAGE, IT'S NOT NC-17 THEY CUT A SCENE AND IT WAS BUMPED DOWN TO AN ""R"".Overall: B+, Me likey!",4,"4.5 stars, A Very Good Horror Movie By French Director Alexandre Aja",1146960000,"05 7, 2006",2006,2497,"['Being', 'huge', 'fan', 'original', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'was', 'more', 'little', 'bit', 'worried', 'film', 'might', 'be', 'complete', 'utter', 'discrace', 'predessesor', 'BUT', 'just', 'other', 'remakes', 'great', 'movies', 'come', 'simply', 'had', 'go', 'see', 'front', 'big', 'screen', 'must', 'say', 'watching', 'remake', 'was', 'anything', 'dissapointed', 'anything', 'nature', 'was', 'actually', 'suprizingly', 'quite', 'good', 'have', 'been', 'following', 'Aja', 'horror', 'films', 'couple', 'years', 'now', 'must', 'confess', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'work', 'style', 'film-making', 'think', 'unique', 'talent', 'making', 'horror', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'bloody', 'nasty', 'sadistic', 'also', 'packing', 'more', 'average', 'puch', 'edge', 'seat', 'suspence.I', 'do', 'not', 'easily', 'get', 'scared', 'was', 'more', 'little', 'bit', 'jumpey', 'scenes.I', 'really', 'love', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'thought', 'Hill', 'Have', 'Eye', 'was', 'right', 'there', 'finest', 'movies', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'Scream', 'One', 'sad', 'thing', 'was', '70', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'budget', 'now-a-days', 'had', 'settle', 'poor', 'quality', 'lighting', 'speacial', 'effects', 'most', 'important', 'run', 'time', 'How', 'long', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'do', 'love', 'low-budget', 'horror', 'films', 'really', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'budget', 'could', 'have', 'added', 'better', 'ending', 'film', 'one', 'thing', 'Aja', 'did', 'make', 'sure', 'improve', 'one', 'ending', 'added', 'quite', 'bit', 'time', 'new', 'one', 'have', 'few', 'more', 'effective', 'closing', 'scenes.Aja', 'did', 'what', 'i', 'think', 'remakes', 'should', 'do', 'was', '1', 'original', 'plot', 'closely', '2', 'Make', 'Reamke', 'more', 'technoligiclly', 'advanced', '3', 'Dont', 'Change', 'Charactors', 'original', '4', 'Dont', 'Change', 'EndingNow', 'veiw', 'point', 'Aja', 'did', 'last', 'one', 'had', 'better', 'ending', 'only', 'thing', 'personally', 'did', 'not', 'remake', 'made', 'people', 'eaters', 'villian', 'guys', 'looking', 'corny', 'cheesy', 'more', 'little', 'stupid', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'scary', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'same', 'kind', 'people', 'original', 'now', 'guys', 'were', 'creepy', 'hell', 'lots', 'others', 'disagree', 'just', 'opinionOverall', 'think', 'original', 'remake', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'would', 'recomment', 'horror', 'fans', 'do', 'keep', 'mind', 'film', 'very', 'bloody', 'R', 'border', 'line', 'NC-17', 'DONT', 'PAY', 'ATTINTION', 'TO', 'THE', 'NC-17', 'RATING', 'ON', 'THIS', 'WEBPAGE', 'IT', 'NOT', 'NC-17', 'THEY', 'CUT', 'A', 'SCENE', 'AND', 'IT', 'WAS', 'BUMPED', 'DOWN', 'TO', 'AN', 'R', '.Overall', 'B+', 'Me', 'likey']",The Hills Have Eyes

When I heard about the new movie, a remake of the same name, I immediately decided that it would have to be better than the original. I saw it the first weekend it was out in theaters, anticipating a really good movie. But you know what? It sucks. It's a brutal, disturbing, violent, unentertaining, and tasteless movie, appealing to those who are sick enough to enjoy it. While this is a broad statement, and untrue, as I know several people who have enjoyed it, it can't be an all untrue statement. There must be someone out there who thought, at least sarcastically, said ""Oh sweet! Pick axe in the eye!"" What this movie doesn't understand is that too much is not always better. There must be at least ten impalements through just the head in this movie, and after the third it got really repetitive. Let's break it down:THE GOOD:-It had about 45 minutes of character development, which is always different but good in horror movies.-A few good jump scenes in the opening sequence, as well as throughout the movie.-There is a nice amount of drama throughout the movie, although it is occasionally overdone (most notably, the ""Where's mom?!"" moment, shown in the preview).THE BAD:-A story that had killers with no motive.-The movie isn't so much a horror movie in the second half, but an action movie.-A certain character has a major turn around.-A baby is threatened and almost killed.-The baby's mother is raped and shot.-Another woman is raped.-A woman is shot and then dies slowly.-A man is burnt to death, after being beaten.-There is one character who shoots at one of the mutants from, no joke, about ten feet away, and misses every shot.-A grim ending.The movie is horrible, and I would never reccomend it to anyone.",1,A Horrible Remake Of A Terrible Movie,1151884800,"07 3, 2006",2006,1852,"['Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'was', 'movie', 'made', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'known', 'world', 'was', 'pretty', 'bad', 'movie', 'overrated', 'boring', 'When', 'heard', 'new', 'movie', 'remake', 'same', 'name', 'immediately', 'decided', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'better', 'original', 'saw', 'first', 'weekend', 'was', 'out', 'theaters', 'anticipating', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'know', 'what', 'brutal', 'disturbing', 'violent', 'unentertaining', 'tasteless', 'movie', 'appealing', 'who', 'are', 'sick', 'enough', 'enjoy', 'broad', 'statement', 'untrue', 'know', 'several', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'untrue', 'statement', 'must', 'be', 'someone', 'who', 'thought', 'least', 'sarcastically', 'said', 'Oh', 'sweet', 'Pick', 'axe', 'eye', 'What', 'movie', ""n't"", 'understand', 'too', 'much', 'not', 'always', 'better', 'must', 'be', 'least', 'ten', 'impalements', 'just', 'head', 'movie', 'third', 'got', 'really', 'repetitive', 'Let', 'break', 'down', 'GOOD', '-It', 'had', '45', 'minutes', 'character', 'development', 'always', 'different', 'good', 'horror', 'movies.-A', 'few', 'good', 'jump', 'scenes', 'opening', 'sequence', 'as', 'well', 'movie.-There', 'nice', 'amount', 'drama', 'movie', 'occasionally', 'overdone', 'most', 'notably', 'Where', 'mom', 'moment', 'shown', 'preview', 'BAD', '-A', 'story', 'had', 'killers', 'motive.-The', 'movie', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'horror', 'movie', 'second', 'half', 'action', 'movie.-A', 'certain', 'character', 'major', 'turn', 'around.-A', 'baby', 'threatened', 'almost', 'killed.-The', 'baby', 'mother', 'raped', 'shot.-Another', 'woman', 'raped.-A', 'woman', 'shot', 'then', 'slowly.-A', 'man', 'burnt', 'death', 'being', 'beaten.-There', 'one', 'character', 'who', 'one', 'mutants', 'joke', 'about', 'ten', 'feet', 'away', 'shot.-A', 'grim', 'ending.The', 'movie', 'horrible', 'would', 'never', 'reccomend', 'anyone']",The Hills Have Eyes

Since then it has acquired a cult film status and has been a regular must see throughout the years in the horror section of Video Rental Stores. I was really curious to see what director Alexandre Aja would do with his remake. The net result is that he stays very close to the original in terms of plot but adds on more detail and background, to the point that the result seems more of a rebuild than a remake. I wonder if Wes Craven in his involvement in this remake actually had some input into the film itself. I say that because this film is so good that it could almost be the original director, revisiting his film and adding to it. However, don't let that observation detract from Aja's work as the director because believe me, he has made a superb horror film here.As I have mentioned before, it stays very closely with the plot and sequences of the original film. The cast get well stuck into their roles, and some of them look eerily like the same characters in the original film too.Aja gives the film a sun bleached look and brings the harshness of the desert environment to life superbly. At times the rocks themselves seem to emanate heat. The plight of the Carter family in this harsh environment is starkly realised, as is the terrifying nature of their assailants - the irradiated mutants.The remake is even gorier than the original, and at times the pace of this film is breathtaking and relentless. Aja, however, gives us more detail than the original into the background of the mutants, and how they came to be the way that they are.He also shows us that the horror genre can make serious social comment. The test dummies that are found throughout the houses of the mutants, can also be interpreted as the attitude of the then US Government towards its citizens at the time of nuclear testing....The audience I saw the film with in the cinema were utterly engrossed in it from start to finish. For the most part they were completely silent, except when screaming and jumping at certain sequences. When leaving the cinema after the film had ended they were all talking among themselves about how good it was.I was amazed at how good it was and the dvd will definitely be joining my collection.If you have not yet seen this film then prepare to be chilled.",5,Prepare to be chilled,1145491200,"04 20, 2006",2006,2372,"['can', 'remember', 'seeing', 'original', 'Hills', 'have', 'Eyes', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'cinema', 'release', 'then', 'acquired', 'cult', 'film', 'status', 'been', 'regular', 'must', 'see', 'years', 'horror', 'section', 'Video', 'Rental', 'Stores', 'was', 'really', 'curious', 'see', 'what', 'director', 'Alexandre', 'Aja', 'would', 'do', 'remake', 'net', 'result', 'very', 'close', 'original', 'terms', 'plot', 'more', 'detail', 'background', 'point', 'result', 'more', 'rebuild', 'remake', 'wonder', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'involvement', 'remake', 'actually', 'had', 'input', 'film', 'say', 'film', 'so', 'good', 'could', 'almost', 'be', 'original', 'director', 'revisiting', 'film', 'adding', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'observation', 'detract', 'Aja', 'work', 'director', 'believe', 'made', 'superb', 'horror', 'film', 'here.As', 'have', 'mentioned', 'very', 'closely', 'plot', 'sequences', 'original', 'film', 'cast', 'get', 'well', 'stuck', 'roles', 'look', 'eerily', 'same', 'characters', 'original', 'film', 'too.Aja', 'film', 'sun', 'bleached', 'look', 'harshness', 'desert', 'environment', 'life', 'superbly', 'times', 'rocks', 'seem', 'emanate', 'heat', 'plight', 'Carter', 'family', 'harsh', 'environment', 'starkly', 'realised', 'terrifying', 'nature', 'assailants', 'irradiated', 'mutants.The', 'remake', 'even', 'gorier', 'original', 'times', 'pace', 'film', 'breathtaking', 'relentless', 'Aja', 'however', 'more', 'detail', 'original', 'background', 'mutants', 'how', 'came', 'be', 'way', 'are.He', 'also', 'horror', 'genre', 'can', 'make', 'serious', 'social', 'comment', 'test', 'dummies', 'are', 'found', 'houses', 'mutants', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'interpreted', 'attitude', 'then', 'US', 'Government', 'towards', 'citizens', 'time', 'nuclear', 'testing', '.The', 'audience', 'saw', 'film', 'cinema', 'were', 'utterly', 'engrossed', 'start', 'finish', 'most', 'part', 'were', 'completely', 'silent', 'when', 'screaming', 'jumping', 'certain', 'sequences', 'When', 'leaving', 'cinema', 'film', 'had', 'ended', 'were', 'talking', 'how', 'good', 'was', 'amazed', 'how', 'good', 'was', 'dvd', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'joining', 'collection.If', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'seen', 'film', 'then', 'prepare', 'be', 'chilled']",The Hills Have Eyes

Moulton ""BookmanNYC""","[2, 5]","The opening of the movie was fantastic with its blend of stock nuclear testing video mixed with short clips that set the tone for the film.But after this the movie, unfortunately, falls flat.Actually, if you deconstruct the film according to plot progression, Beast, the dog, is the protagonist. His love interest (the other dog, Beauty) is the first victim. He is the first to exact revenge on one of the attackers. He saves the human protagonist's life, and shows no fear (he can't. He's a dog).After that, the actual gore and horror was uninventive to say the least. Here are these deformed and mentally scarred people and all but one of the murders they perform in the film are by gun shot. GUNS? At this point, with the bar set so high by other gore flicks (saw series, others of it's ilk) murder with a gun is anti-climatic and more needless than anything.Sadly, there was no development of the hill people than a few photographs of their former selves on graves of their fallen and one pedantic monologue that was readily discarded (oh, the dog killed that man as well. The human protagonist ran off with a bat).Here are characters who have a real reason to hate Americans and the government and all the time was to spent setting up how anachronist the town was.I'm not a cinematographer or light specialist, but I really felt that these, while good, were not great. The town could have been more moody. The insides of the houses could have been creepier. Motion could have been more disjointed or something, ANYTHING.All in all, rent this and see for yourself.

986890,A38UHOCEKSUOSP,B000FAOC2M,"dominion_ruler ""Bryan""","[3, 3]","Though this Wes Craven remake is not going to be terribly memorable, it is far from poor.  The Hills Have Eyes gives us a little bit of everything that a modern horror film can provide - some scares, lots of blood, gore, and a variety of disturbing images and scenes.  Some might be too disturbing, as I found it difficult to watch a deformed human creature raping a young teenage girl (the scene isn't presented in detail, but there's enough shown to reveal it's occuring).Unlike some horror films, I think this tries to prove some points.  The points it might make are not what this movie is all about (it's the horror entertainment obviously) and they will have little impact given the amount of gruesomeness this film pours over itself by finish.  The beginning credits show old video and photos of nuclear tests in the United States desert, and their unfortunate effects on any humans who still resided in the area.  It is becuase of these tests, they not only grew deformed, but many turned into savage beasts who will not just kill anyone who comes across their territory, but slaughter them...and sometimes eat them too.The movies focuses around a typical bickering family, headed for a vacation in San Diego, half of whom aren't that excited about.  Dad - Big Bob Carter (Ted Levine) - decides to take the scenic route through the desert.  At a gas station in the middle of nowhere, the owner provides him with directions claiming to be a shortcut, but in turn is a setup.  After a road accident on this back road, the family is stranded.  Bob and his son-in-law Doug Bukowski (Aaron Stanford) split up and walk the road looking for help.  As night falls, the creatures from the hills begin to move in, and this is when the first (and probably) most horrific scene of the movie takes place.After the deaths of several family members (much to my surprise who some were) Doug sets out for revenge and to get his baby daughter back who has been kidnapped.  He ventures out into the old towns where nuclear testing used to take place.  Many of the creatures are living in the towns, including those who have caused the disturbing and graphic trauma to this family.  Doug finds himself in a climactic showdown with some of these creatures, and the result is a very bloody, and graphically violent scene.  Normally when a camera would pull away in a film, it doesn't happen here.  All kinds of weapons and tools are shoved into necks, faces and heads.What begins as some scares in the first 30 minutes, quickly turns into disturbing imagery and concluding with all out blood and gore.  The violence at the end is almost a welcome sight I must say, as the creatures probably deserved it after what they did earlier.

Sure if you look at the plot you've seen this type of movie a thousand times. However its all in the execution, there is a good amount to time spent for character development. This time also helps to build the tension. The time spent on the characters is key because it really makes you want to root for the family in this movie.

Along the way they meet a local, that doesn't seem quite right, who later blows his head off; later there enters an inbred, psychopathic group of cannibals, with one that is sympathetic toward the horror that will soon befall the innocent group of travelers, throw in a kidnapped baby and what do you have.....

All the movies are either remakes, or based on the premise of another. HILLS is weak, the victim family characters are unlikeable, the story predictable, even to the most elementary horror fan, and i dare anyone to say that they didn't want at least one or two of the victim family members to get killed off (yes, they were THAT unlikeable).I will add that the cheapest lowest, most unnecessarily disgusting part of the movie (which makes me want to burn my DVD right now) was in the rape scene, which leaves me to feel that Wes Craven might even be a lower form of life that the mutated canabilistic family in HILLS.I cant honestly say that i saw the first version of HILLS but i cant imagine it having been worse than this one, leaving me to wonder why the heck it was made to begin with, however as long as suckers like me keep pumping money into Hollywood for ideas that have already been done, I'm really not giving them any reason to come up with any new ones.For you, (the fans of horror) all i can say is if you want to see a little gore, with very little plot or originality, check it out, for those of you who are die hard horror fans (like myself) id advise you to do like me and check out some of Amazons other classic horror flicks from the 70's and 80's, they are cheaper, original, and something Hills wasn't....Scary.",1,The Hills might have Eye's but they clearly don't have fresh ideas.,1151712000,"07 1, 2006",2006,2200,"['Take', 'will', 'group', 'people', 'taking', 'little', 'getaway', 'somewhere', 'southwestern', 'America', 'way', 'meet', 'local', ""n't"", 'seem', 'quite', 'right', 'who', 'later', 'head', 'later', 'inbred', 'psychopathic', 'group', 'cannibals', 'one', 'sympathetic', 'horror', 'will', 'soon', 'befall', 'innocent', 'group', 'travelers', 'throw', 'kidnapped', 'baby', 'what', 'do', 'have', 'say', 'think', 'are', 'watching', 'remake', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'Sorry', ""'re"", 'just', 'have', 'been', 'suckered', 'watching', 'THE', 'HILLS', 'HAVE', 'EYES', 'Unrated', 'version', '.Deep', 'down', 'i', 'want', 'blame', 'producers', 'movie', 'putting', 'underwear', 'stain', 'movie', 'out', 'However', 'becoming', 'painfully', 'clear', 'fault', 'watching', 'having', 'hope', 'new', 'ideas', 'will', 'come', 'out', 'anytime', 'soon', 'horror', 'genre', 'movies', 'are', 'remakes', 'based', 'premise', 'HILLS', 'weak', 'victim', 'family', 'characters', 'are', 'unlikeable', 'story', 'predictable', 'even', 'most', 'elementary', 'horror', 'fan', 'i', 'dare', 'anyone', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'least', 'one', 'two', 'victim', 'family', 'members', 'get', 'killed', 'off', 'yes', 'were', 'THAT', 'unlikeable', '.I', 'will', 'add', 'cheapest', 'lowest', 'most', 'unnecessarily', 'disgusting', 'part', 'movie', 'want', 'burn', 'DVD', 'right', 'now', 'was', 'rape', 'scene', 'feel', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'might', 'even', 'be', 'lower', 'form', 'life', 'mutated', 'canabilistic', 'family', 'HILLS.I', 'cant', 'honestly', 'say', 'i', 'saw', 'first', 'version', 'HILLS', 'i', 'cant', 'imagine', 'having', 'been', 'worse', 'one', 'leaving', 'wonder', 'why', 'heck', 'was', 'made', 'begin', 'however', 'as', 'long', 'suckers', 'keep', 'pumping', 'money', 'Hollywood', 'ideas', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'done', ""'m"", 'really', 'not', 'giving', 'reason', 'come', 'up', 'new', 'ones.For', 'fans', 'horror', 'i', 'can', 'say', 'want', 'see', 'little', 'gore', 'very', 'little', 'plot', 'originality', 'check', 'out', 'who', 'are', 'die', 'hard', 'horror', 'fans', 'id', 'advise', 'do', 'check', 'out', 'Amazons', 'other', 'classic', 'horror', 'flicks', '70', '80', 'are', 'cheaper', 'original', 'something', 'Hills', 'was', ""n't"", '.Scary']",The Hills Have Eyes

The original was a portrait of two families, both rednecks. The humour was in their similarities, not their differences. The crassness and vulgarity. What ultimately seperated the two was that one family was motivated by fear and the other love. Craven throws out this blue collar earthiness and focuses on a passing comment in the original, that of atomic testing. I suppose this was done to justify a remake, but in the cack hands of a talentless director the results are predictably plodding and routine. We are given a thuddingly didactic, not to mention self pitying sermon on the destruction of community that frequently lacks logic.The other point of the original was that there was no cover. Zero. Zilch. Also it was clear in the original that the Carter family was a rare opportunity as no one ever came to that neck of the woods. In this dire remake you are left scratching your heads as to why the far more experienced raiders show such ineptitude.

This of course does not always make a good horror movie, it's in the way the makers push the boundaries of horror into different realms. They push horror in a way that the remake of the fog can only dream of. Just watch the scene in `Hills' where the mutants converge on the trailer and tell me you don't feel the shock and sheer terror that can only come when watching a really great horror movie.`The Hills Have Eyes' is brought to us by French director Aja Alexandre, who previously brought us High Tension a suspenseful film with a rotten ending - the ending some people admired. Alexandre brings a refreshingly un-Hollywood approach to the film, with it's bleak and uncompromising view, where you get the feeling that anything could happen to the characters at anytime.

I thought maybe because Craven, himself, was involved with this film it would exceed my expectations and I'd be pleasantly suprised. Well, unfortunately that didn't happen.Of course the lighting is better, the effects are better, the sound is better because they had millions of dollars to work with. Unfortunately none of this makes the movie any better.To start with the family is contemptable, you get an immediate dislike for all of them, especially Doug. At this point you're almost routing for them to get slaughtered.In ""The Hills"" original we learn the backround of the main cannibal (Papa Jupiter) and we know he has a family of blood thirsty children. In ""The Hills"" remake we know nothing of these mutated freaks, except from what you read in the newspaper articles that flash across the screen.At least in the original the family in the mountains has a reason for attacking the innocent family, after all, they're cannibals and they're hungry. However, is there ever really a reason these mutated freaks attack the family in the remake?The acting seemed lackluster, almost as if the actors and actresses seemed disinterested in their roles. Like I said earlier, yes, the effects are better, as is the lighting and sound but it really doesn't improve the the original film.If you've never seen the original you may find this film pleasing, I mean it does have it's moments. However, if you've seen Craven's classic you'll probably find that they don't compare. Craven showed in his earlier works that it doesn't take a big budget to create a classic horror film, rather it takes a creative idea and a dedication to your work.

The remake of ""The Hills Have Eyes fails with regard to number one but succeeds with regard to number two.

That being said, I think the setting of this movie is very effective and potentially could have been a great setting and a great situation for a good horror movie, but that doesn't happen with the remake of ""Hills"".Instead, ""Hills"" is about a family who travels into the desert and their camper hits a ""bump"" in the road and breaks down.  What transpires is a brutal and savage series of murders by a bunch of mutated cannibalistic monsters that have suffered mutations as a result of nuclear testing.  TWO stars for the setting and situational horror, but the lack of style and absence of atmospheric horror certainly brings this movie down quite a bit.  Plenty of blood and gore to go around, but not enough atmosphere in this remake.  The acting could have been a lot better, but I've seen much worse from these remakes.

986916,A1BXFS1R6NBXDD,B000FAOC2M,Horror Nerd,"[1, 4]","I am a huge horror fan. I think the original Hills Have Eyes is a classic. So I was sad when I found the new one is an empty headed waste. Remakes are best when they find a new angle on a story, or have something to add to what the first film did. Great remakes such as The Thing or The Fly work because the filmmakers created movies that use the original as a starting point and then go off in their own direction - much like the remake of Dawn of the Dead.Hills have eyes is almost a shot for shot redo in the vein of Psycho at times. It misses the entire point of the original film - that we are only as civilized as our world allows. None of the interesting parallel between the two families remains (one from the 'burbs the other a clan of cannibal mutants). Instead we just get loads and loads of gore without any impact whatsoever.I like gory movies as much as the next person. I love Blood Feast, Romero's zombie films, Re-animator, the movies of Lucio Fulci, etc. But those films had something more then just gore. They were creative, inventive, some were fun, some were scary. This lame rehash of Hills is none of those things. I can't stress what a waste of time this so called picture is.

986919,A7PZZXJJZM4N2,B000FAOC2M,Isaac,"[2, 4]","I don't know what to make of ""The Hills Have Eyes."" It's not a good movie, but neither is it a bad one. It is relentlessly stupid, but is also relentlessly exciting. It's not easy to watch, but its also a guilty horror pleasure. It certainly isn't original, with figures running across the screen in the foreground with the cues of high-pitched music, characters wondering off by themselves, and the weird local at the filling station who says there is a shortcut down a dirt road that actually leaves to a group of murderous, deformed cannibals. Most of it is thrilling, some of it is aimless. I can't recommend it, but I am not advising you to not see it.I do advise that viewers with weak stomachs beware of this grisly remake of the 1977 Wes Craven hit. It is another horror film in a long line of updates of '70s cult classics. It's no secret that such films were period noir, with Charles Manson and the Son of Sam running rampant and terrorizing Americans. Hollywood didn't let up. They chose to release ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" which was about a relentless psycho terrorizing a group of young motorists. ""The Hills Have Eyes"" was probably the most flawed horror film of that decade, and whatever improvements are made here are somehow rendered inconsequential. The film is an absolute shocker, but it has a lack of imagination, something that this kind of big studio genre film should be overflowing with.The film is scary, unlike the 2003 remake of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" which was more of an ugly, sloppy horror film workout session. ""The Hills Have Eyes"" is a bit more of a genuine thriller. I was enjoying it until it got a little rediculous in the third act, when one character suddenly bursts into unhinged hero mode and survives only because the villains are too stupid to kill him. For the most part, it is a replica of Wes Craven's original, with a family traveling through the desert and being ambushed by a clan of hill people. In the original they were just gross-out beings, the kind of people you wouldn't want to be living next door to. Here, they are the descendants of miners who refused to leave their town while the government conducted nuclear tests in the desert between the years of 1947 and 1962Now, they are cannibalistic mutants, and when they finally show up, it's not a pretty picture. A character is burned at the stake, a blonde teenage girl is pinned down in her bed, a woman is blown away with .44 Magnum, and the family's infant girl is taken away. This is truly terrifying on the surface, but as the film progressed, and as I watched with a keen interest, I realized that everything felt a little too staged. In fact, it gets pretty sill toward the end, which is a big no-no for this kind of horror film. Had one of the ""Scream"" films followed a pattern similar to this movie, I would have accepted it. Those films were pure farce, and moved along happily in self-parody.Alexander Aja has made the mistake of taking the creepiness factor out of the villains, something that the original film was note-perfect on. Here, they are nothing more than deformed monsters with bulging heads, warped faces, and grungy voices (one of them is confined to a wheelchair because his head weighs more than the rest of his body and another one is fitted with a neck brace). This is all well done with believable make-up, but why should we fear them, besides the fact that they are ugly and have the willpower to kill? In the original, they used walkie-talkies to communicate and set up traps. Here, they use improvisation, and none of it is believable, even if this is a horror film. The realism of Norman Bates was that he knew where his victims were. These monsters just attack as if they were a pack of wolves. We've seen this done before.The actors are well cast and play their parts believably. What makes ""The Hills Have Eyes"" effective in it's own way is that we have characters who we like, if only for a short while. Some of them are taken out unexpectedly or too suddenly, while some of the more annoying ones are either left alive or saved for later. And the character that I mentioned above who suddenly snaps and begins terrorizing the mutants is the last person you would expect to become a hero, and his screentime becomes absolutely crazy and ridiculous.I have the feeling that Aja knew what he was doing the entire time. He goes for gritty cinematography, paying tribute to horror outings of the '70s more effectively than Rob Zombie's ""House of 1000 Corpses"" and ""Devil's Rejects."" For the first thirty minutes, the tension that he brings to the film is so thick that you can cut it with a knife, and when things finally get nasty in the second act, he sees to it that it is almost unbearingly brutal and shocking. This is probably the most violent horror picture in quite some time, unlike ""Hostel,"" which was violent because it didn't know how to be anything else and never developed a thrill factor.The screenplay has been written, by Aja, Gregory Levasseur, and Wes Craven, is riddled with the typical horror film logic gaps, often involving characters who are dumb enough to wonder off by themselves without realizing that it was one of the great horror movie cliches. It even gets the family's two dogs in on the action, and one of them intervines at a crucial moment and assures that one villain won't be walking anytime soon. The three writers know when to stop the bloodletting long enough for us to catch our breath, but in the end, they don't know how to write an efficient movie.There was a ""Hills Have Eyes II"" and it was an embarassing miscalculation. The remake definitely leaves itself open for a sequel, but judging by how brainless the villains are, despite their large heads, a sequel would essentially be a remake of it's predecessor. It upsets me to think that a truly terrifying horror film can get so reved up it's nastiness that it overlooks the fact that it's a little too silly. I'm hoping that Aja will learn a lesson or two from his newest film. He obviously knows a thing or two about making movies.",2,The Hills Have Eyes,1142035200,"03 11, 2006",2006,6084,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'make', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'not', 'good',

The family is stupid to take the short cut in the middle of the desert and then the split up and then they leave the girls alone in the camper coem on. The acting is ok but not the greatest.

986922,AGP0LMEHFQITC,B000FAOC2M,"James Lucas Chatfield ""Religion: musician""","[7, 22]","With recent exercises in unpleasantness like ""Hostel"" and ""Wolf Creek"", and the rise of 70's horror remakes (""Texas Chainsaw"" and ""The Omen"" to name just a couple), it was no surprise to hear that Wes Craven's semi-classic ""The Hills Have Eyes"" was being updated.  For it's time, the original ""Hills"" was pretty unpleasant, and also wildly popular.  It was also one of the early examples of what a lot of film critics refer to as ""Pornoviolence"".  You don't watch them for the plot.  You watch them for the death scenes.In the new one, the story's the same, which is to say there ain't much of one.  They tried a little harder, but it's still just a family getting stranded in the desert (after taking shortcut-advice from the creepy ol' gas station guy...duh...) and then getting attacked by cannibal mutants.  After a few graphic deaths, and a stolen infant, the survivors take on the bad guys in a series of bloody cat-and-mouse scenes until the end of the movie, at which point they're still stranded in the middle of the desert.  Maybe they should have let the mutants do them a favor.Well, lame story (and dialogue...and acting) aside, the goods are delivered here.  The gore is plentiful and well-done, with amphasis on slow, painful deaths.  For those who spend money to see this stuff, enjoy.  I admit, some of it was fun to watch in a juvenile way, but there was no sympathy factor for anyone on screen (except maybe the dogs and the baby), and there were way too many long scenes of someone walking through the desert hills, looking around nervously and waiting for something scary to happen.  It never does, unless you really weren't expecting a demented mutant cannibal to jump out from somewhere and start swinging a pickaxe, but since that's the point of this movie, we're okay there.Director Alexandre Aja made a much better horror movie called ""High Tension"".  It was also very violent and gory, but it was scary and kept you interested even when somebody wasn't getting killed.

986926,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B000FAOC2M,Jason,"[0, 0]","The Hills Have Eyes is a worthy remake of a classic horror film, and it doesn't disappoint.A family that decides to go on a road-trip vacation makes a horrible decision, like Wrong Turn in a desert setting, to take a ridiculous shortcut on a dirt road through some mountains in the desert, and they are quickly rewarded by being named...Moron Family of the Year!The family, known universally as the Three Course Moron Meal, are led by Big Bob Carter, the patriarch, who is very quickly turned into Shish-ka-Bob Carter, as he does his best impression of Joan of Arc playing with matches. Despite allegedly being a detective and starting his own detective business, which automatically makes him the one guy who is supposed to be able to competently defend his family, Bob is woefully inept and since he has the most annoying voice since Fran Drescher, I immediately wanted him to die. The Joan of Arc scene satisfied my needs. Thank you Alexandre Aja (director) for that wonderful decision.What will trouble most viewers is not what troubled me: The inability to fire a weapon. It's time to go to the shooting range.Big Bob was a detective! And at the first sign of trouble, he starts firing random shots into the darkness like a little girl afraid of the sounds in the woods. Detective indeed. Inspector Gadget was more competent.I would have suggested that this family, one which is stocked full of side-arms like a small town police station, should have chosen otherwise for their vacation plans. Instead of a drive through the desert, they should have chosen to drive to the nearest shooting range, be it skeet or targets, and practice with all the weapons, because they have absolutely no clue how to fire a gun.Shortly after the most pathetic tough guy in cinema history provides the fire for some campfire s'mores, the mutants attack. The inbred, retarded, mutant hillbillies are angry; they're angry because they have been left in the desert while nuclear testing ensued. For several generations they have been soaking up nuclear radiation, and their resulting appearance is no doubt their motive for murder and cannibalization. Although, since the freaks had an average of four teeth each, I'm not quite sure how the cannibal situations worked.Nonetheless, during the camper attack scene in the movie is where I began to have an idea. Do mongoloid hillbillies from the deep-south watch movies like The Hills Have Eyes and secretly cheer for people that resemble relatives? Do they scream, ""Git that there city slicker!"" while the guy with three eyes and a watermelon-sized head attacks a helpless victim?What surely troubled most people is the disgusting rape scene that is no doubt similar to some family outings in the Deliverance south. Any time a mutant rapes a young girl, the movie has turned for the worse. Although, the scene itself is somewhat funny because I couldn't stop thinking of the character Sloth from The Goonies getting a little action. (Don't get me wrong; rape is probably the most depolorable act that anyone could even think of. It's disgusting on all levels.)SLOTH GONNA GET SOME ACTION?BABY, RUTH, RUTH, BABY!The movie was psychotic, semi-coherent, blood-soaked, visceral, and Sloth got lucky; I loved it.",4,Sloth gets some action!,1152144000,"07 6, 2006",2006,3239,"['Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'worthy', 'remake', 'classic', 'horror', 'film', ""n't"", 'disappoint.A', 'family', 'go', 'road-trip', 'vacation', 'horrible', 'decision', 'Wrong', 'Turn', 'desert', 'setting', 'take', 'ridiculous', 'shortcut', 'dirt', 'road', 'mountains', 'desert', 'are', 'quickly', 'rewarded', 'being', 'named', 'Moron', 'Family', 'Year', 'family', 'known', 'universally', 'Three', 'Course', 'Moron', 'Meal', 'are', 'led', 'Big', 'Bob', 'Carter', 'patriarch', 'who', 'very', 'quickly', 'turned', 'Shish-ka-Bob', 'Carter', 'best', 'impression', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'playing', 'matches', 'allegedly', 'being', 'detective', 'starting', 'own', 'detective', 'business', 'automatically', 'one', 'guy', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'able', 'competently', 'defend', 'family', 'Bob', 'woefully', 'inept', 'most', 'annoying', 'voice', 'Fran', 'Drescher', 'immediately', 'wanted', 'die', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'scene', 'satisfied', 'needs', 'Thank', 'Alexandre', 'Aja', 'director', 'wonderful', 'will', 'trouble', 'most', 'viewers', 'not', 'what', 'troubled', 'inability', 'fire', 'weapon', 'time', 'go', 'shooting', 'range.Big', 'Bob', 'was', 'detective', 'first', 'sign', 'trouble', 'firing', 'random', 'shots', 'darkness', 'little', 'girl', 'afraid', 'sounds', 'woods', 'Detective', 'indeed', 'Inspector', 'Gadget', 'was', 'more', 'competent.I', 'would', 'have', 'suggested', 'family', 'one', 'stocked', 'full', 'side-arms', 'small', 'town', 'police', 'station', 'should', 'have', 'chosen', 'otherwise', 'vacation', 'plans', 'Instead', 'drive', 'desert', 'should', 'have', 'chosen', 'drive', 'nearest', 'shooting', 'range', 'be', 'skeet', 'targets', 'practice', 'weapons', 'have', 'absolutely', 'clue', 'how', 'fire', 'gun.Shortly', 'most', 'pathetic', 'tough', 'guy', 'cinema', 'history', 'fire', 'campfire', ""s'mores"", 'mutants', 'attack', 'inbred', 'retarded', 'mutant', 'hillbillies', 'are', 'angry', ""'re"", 'angry', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'desert', 'nuclear', 'testing', 'ensued', 'several', 'generations', 'have', 'been', 'soaking', 'up', 'nuclear', 'radiation', 'resulting', 'appearance', 'doubt', 'motive', 'murder', 'cannibalization', 'freaks', 'had', 'average', 'four', 'teeth', ""'m"", 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'how', 'cannibal', 'situations', 'worked.Nonetheless', 'camper', 'attack', 'scene', 'movie', 'where', 'began', 'have', 'idea', 'Do', 'mongoloid', 'hillbillies', 'deep-south', 'watch', 'movies', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'secretly', 'cheer', 'people', 'resemble', 'relatives', 'Do', 'scream', 'Git', 'city', 'slicker', 'guy', 'three', 'eyes', 'watermelon-sized', 'head', 'helpless', 'victim', 'What', 'surely', 'troubled', 'most', 'people', 'disgusting', 'rape', 'scene', 'doubt', 'similar', 'family', 'outings', 'Deliverance', 'south', 'time', 'mutant', 'young', 'girl', 'movie', 'turned', 'worse', 'scene', 'somewhat', 'funny', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'thinking', 'character', 'Sloth', 'Goonies', 'getting', 'little', 'action', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'rape', 'probably', 'most', 'depolorable', 'act', 'anyone', 'could', 'even', 'think', 'disgusting', 'levels', 'SLOTH', 'GON', 'NA', 'GET', 'SOME', 'ACTION', 'BABY', 'RUTH', 'RUTH', 'BABY', 'movie', 'was', 'psychotic', 'semi-coherent', 'blood-soaked', 'visceral', 'Sloth', 'got', 'lucky', 'loved']",The Hills Have Eyes

The film doesn't get bogged down in convoluted plot details as if every little thing has to be explained to the nth degree.  Instead the story chooses to focus on the family so that we can grow to care for these poor schlubs and anticipate the horror that much more when it arrives.The basic premise is this.  A family is driving through the desert on a road trip vacation.  They have an ""accident"" and are stranded in the middle of the New Mexico desert.  Soon after the mutants start moving in.  The fun goes from there!This film is executed exactly as horror afficianados would want.  If only more horror productions would follow this film's example.  There's plenty of creepiness to tease viewers along early on as the story unfolds.  And plenty of blood, guts and oh yeah, pick axes to satisfy the most hardcore gore lover!  Surpisingly, the acting is quite believable and isn't too over the top making the horror that much more meaningful.  We believe to a greater degree than usual that the vacationing family could be a real one.  We are tempted to put ourselves in their shoes and ponder the frightening proposition that is before them.

A normal, lovable family is traveling through the Nevada desert.  Their vehicle breaks down and they are beset upon by cannibals.  However, the remake has more details (and I'm not referring to gore, although there is plenty) that make it a more realistic, faster paced thrill ride.  The opening scene is both shocking and horrifying.  The viewer soon realizes that this remake will be more violent than the original.Mild mannered cell phone retailer Doug Burkowski (Aaron Stanford of ""X-Men:  The Last Stand"") steals the film when he must turn into Rambo in order to get his baby back from the mutant cannibals who abducted her while his father-in-law was being roasted alive.  This lean, wiry built man kills a lot of tough mutants.  He also discovers a crater where dozens of vehicles have been stored - their owners slaughtered by mutants - and an eerie, fabricated town occupied by mannequins.  This is the town that the government was using for testing nuclear bombs.  Now it is occupied by hideously deformed, inbred miners who suffered radiation damage while hiding in the mines.The entire film has a creepy Twilight Zone atmosphere that wasn't found in the original.  Furthermore, ""The Hills Have Eyes"" remake was highly influenced by ""Wrong Turn,"" another film involving a cannibalistic family - this one living in the secluded woods of West Virginia.If you enjoy cannibalistic horror classics involving inbred families such as ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" ""Wrong Turn,"" ""Raw Meat,"" etc., then you must see Wes Craven's remake of ""The Hills Have Eyes.""

I've yet to see Craven's original, so I can't really compare this remake to it. Although, from what I've heard this remake is far better. If I had seen the original, I would probably agree. Alexandre Aja, who brought us a little French film called ""High Tension"" is at the blood and guts genre again. This time he has more people to slaughter and a great team behind him to bring these horrific mutants to life. What we as an audience get is a sick, twisted, no holds barred horror film that isn't afraid to smack the viewer in the face. With so many horror films playing it ""safe"" in the recent years, Hills Have Eyes clearly went the opposite direction in the horrors of the horror genre.Alexandre Aja and co manages to create such creepy and isolated atmospheres, that if there were no mutants at all I would still get the creeps. The hills play characters themselves, as the home to these creatures, they too are frightening. The cinematography is too scare people and it does a pretty decent job at that. How is this film slightly different from other horror films out there today? Well, instead of having a guy kill a bunch of teenagers, we have disfigured mutants (like the film U-Turn)that kills and rapes a family.Yes, there is a rape scene, and while it's not as horrific as some may have it seem to be, you still have that uncomfortable feeling when it starts to play out. With the girl getting beaten by her attacker, and then raped. While this may seem tame compared to the women beating of ""Ichi The Killer"", this film if more mainstream, so you can sense of surprised face when I saw it. There are two scenes that are the highlights of Hills; one is when the mutants first attack the family, which is where the rape takes place. The second is when one of the family members goes to the mutants ""home"" and becomes a killing machine.The blood and gore? Plenty. One to keep the gore hounds happy. Hills showcase a mix of CGI and prop deaths. Along with the effects from the brilliant minds of KNB (old school Evil Dead, I love these guys). Seeing the mutants is fun too, even if you can't remember the names of any of them. They are cool to look at and all, but not very memorable.Other remake such as `The Fog' and `The Omen,' can't compare to `Hills Have Eyes' because it stands out of the bunch.

And I can give you a list of horror remakes that just make my blood boil, especially the remake of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". I mean, what's the point of the remake if you basically change everything about the original film.Well, maybe it's because this remake is produced by the original director, Wes Craven, but this is how you do a remake.I understand that it is necessary to change some things about the original, simply because we live in different times, as well as the opportunity to tell a better story with better technology. And while this remake does take some liberties with the story, it remains remarkably faithful to the original. I was very impressed. The changes that are here are actually an improvement on the original. Overall, if you like horror, you should love this one.My only complaint is while there are plenty of gross moments, I felt like there were only a time or two that the film felt scary. I think this movie could have been a bit scarier, if some of the killings were more thought out. This doesn't deter the film much, but I think it keeps it from being a true classic.

986943,A2B9WOSXCU7LDM,B000FAOC2M,"Jordan ""brainofj72""","[1, 2]","Fresh off his visceral masterpiece Haute tension, French director Alexandre Aja gets behind the camera once more for his second film, a revamping of Wes Craven's 1977 Texas Chainsaw wanna-be The Hills Have Eyes.Upon a casual glance, it's easy to dismiss Hills as yet another useless Hollywood remake of a gritty `70s horror film - the original is indeed gritty and from the `70s. However, unlike Dawn of the Dead or The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Hills is a film that could actually benefit from an updating. Also, unlike the Dawn and Chainsaw remakes, Hills has a director at the helm that actually loves the genre and knows what the hell he's doing.By now, the scenario is all too familiar: an all-American family gets lost in the middle of nowhere and falls prey to some twisted clan of deranged psychopaths. Clich&eacute;d? Sure, but don't forget that the original Hills was one of the first. So just what does Aja bring to the table that sets Hills apart from the other (usually laughable) films of this type? An abundance of style, realism, emotion, and gore.Aja seems to have a very solid understanding of the most primal emotions possessed by mankind, and in Hills, he explores them in a way that most filmmakers wouldn't dare. As in Haute tension, the violence is presented in a delicate blend of realistic horror and exploitative titillation. When the family is first attacked, the violence is brutal and ugly. However, when the tables are turned a member of the family becomes the one inflicting the violence, the bloodletting is slightly heightened and exploited for entertainment. Could the protagonist be enjoying his vicious revenge? Aja portrays this masterfully and dares his audience to enjoy it with the protagonist. Just how far should one be willing to go? How far is too far? Is this just as wrong? Can it be justified?Something else atypical about Hills is that we actually care about the characters. Instead of the usual ditzy blonde teens we can't wait to see get killed off, these characters are believable and we feel for them. They are all wonderfully portrayed by the fine cast, especially Aaron Stanford (whom you may recognize from X-Men 2 and 3), who gives a surprisingly terrific performance.Something else that makes Hills more than just an average slasher flick is the masterfully subtle social commentary. The ever-present motif of the American flag (quite literally being shoved down a throat at one point)...the rousing score so peculiarly similar to Ennio Morricone's distinctly (and ironically) American The Good, The Bad and The Ugly...the ubiquitous desiccated desert landscape that bears a suspicious resemblance to the Middle East...this film has something to say.The only real flaw I can find in Hills is that there are, occasionally, a few groan-inducing ""jump scares"". They're cheap, gimmicky, and wholly unnecessary. But considering that Haute tension is pretty much entirely without such trickery, I can only guess (and hope) that they were due to studio interference. They have to at least somewhat cater to that moronic demographic, I suppose.So what's next for Aja? He says his next film, The Waiting, is going to be a gore-less ghost story. He says he wants to see if he can be scary without the gore. There you have it, folks - a man that is unafraid to unflinchingly show copious bloodshed, knows how to present subtle social commentary, and is looking to challenge himself. If the horror genre has a savior, Alexandre Aja is it.",5,Far More Than Just Another Remake,1154822400,"08 6, 2006",2006,3482,"['Fresh', 'off', 'visceral', 'masterpiece', 'Haute', 'tension', 'French', 'director', 'Alexandre', 'Aja', 'camera', 'once', 'more', 'second', 'film', 'revamping', 'Wes', 'Craven', '1977', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'wanna-be', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes.Upon', 'casual', 'glance', 'easy', 'dismiss', 'Hills', 'yet', 'useless', 'Hollywood', 'remake', 'gritty', '70s', 'horror', 'film', 'original', 'indeed', 'gritty', '70s', 'However', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'Hills', 'film', 'could', 'actually', 'benefit', 'updating', 'Also', 'Dawn', 'Chainsaw', 'remakes', 'Hills', 'director', 'helm', 'actually', 'genre', 'what', 'hell', 'doing.By', 'now', 'scenario', 'too', 'familiar', 'all-American', 'family', 'lost', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'prey', 'twisted', 'clan', 'deranged', 'psychopaths', 'Clich', 'eacute', 'Sure', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'original', 'Hills', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'So', 'just', 'what', 'Aja', 'bring', 'table', 'Hills', 'apart', 'other', 'usually', 'laughable', 'films', 'type', 'abundance', 'style', 'realism', 'emotion', 'gore.Aja', 'have', 'very', 'solid', 'understanding', 'most', 'primal', 'emotions', 'possessed', 'mankind', 'Hills', 'way', 'most', 'filmmakers', 'would', ""n't"", 'dare', 'Haute', 'tension', 'violence', 'presented', 'delicate', 'blend', 'realistic', 'horror', 'exploitative', 'titillation', 'When', 'family', 'first', 'attacked', 'violence', 'brutal', 'ugly', 'However', 'when', 'tables', 'are', 'turned', 'member', 'family', 'one', 'inflicting', 'violence', 'bloodletting', 'slightly', 'heightened', 'exploited', 'entertainment', 'Could', 'protagonist', 'be', 'enjoying', 'vicious', 'revenge', 'Aja', 'masterfully', 'audience', 'enjoy', 'protagonist', 'Just', 'how', 'far', 'should', 'one', 'be', 'willing', 'go', 'How', 'far', 'too', 'far', 'just', 'wrong', 'Can', 'be', 'justified', 'Something', 'else', 'atypical', 'Hills', 'actually', 'care', 'characters', 'Instead', 'usual', 'ditzy', 'blonde', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'get', 'killed', 'off', 'characters', 'are', 'believable', 'feel', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'portrayed', 'fine', 'cast', 'especially', 'Aaron', 'Stanford', 'whom', 'may', 'recognize', 'X-Men', '2', '3', 'who', 'surprisingly', 'terrific', 'performance.Something', 'else', 'Hills', 'more', 'just', 'average', 'slasher', 'flick', 'masterfully', 'subtle', 'social', 'commentary', 'ever-present', 'motif', 'American', 'flag', 'quite', 'literally', 'being', 'shoved', 'down', 'throat', 'one', 'point', 'rousing', 'score', 'so', 'peculiarly', 'similar', 'Ennio', 'Morricone', 'distinctly', 'ironically', 'Good', 'Bad', 'Ugly', 'ubiquitous', 'desiccated', 'desert', 'landscape', 'suspicious', 'resemblance', 'Middle', 'East', 'film', 'something', 'say.The', 'only', 'real', 'flaw', 'can', 'find', 'Hills', 'are', 'occasionally', 'few', 'groan-inducing', 'jump', 'scares', ""'re"", 'cheap', 'gimmicky', 'wholly', 'unnecessary', 'considering', 'Haute', 'tension', 'pretty', 'much', 'entirely', 'such', 'trickery', 'can', 'only', 'guess', 'hope', 'were', 'due', 'studio', 'interference', 'have', 'least', 'somewhat', 'cater', 'moronic', 'demographic', 'suppose.So', 'what', 'next', 'Aja', 'next', 'film', 'Waiting', 'going', 'be', 'gore-less', 'ghost', 'story', 'see', 'can', 'be', 'scary', 'gore', 'have', 'man', 'unafraid', 'unflinchingly', 'show', 'copious', 'bloodshed', 'how', 'present', 'subtle', 'social', 'commentary', 'looking', 'challenge', 'horror', 'genre', 'savior', 'Alexandre', 'Aja']",The Hills Have Eyes
986944,A3J2VL63SUVXVE,B000FAOC2M,"Jordan Itkowitz ""Racontornado""","[2, 3]","Of all of the classic 70s slashers films, the original HHE has always been one of my favorites, chiefly because of the question it poses: at what point do you slide from civilization to savagery when presented with brutal tragedy and survival? Here, that tragedy is the brutal slaying of three siblings' family at the hands of desert-dwelling cannibals in the middle of an old nuclear test site. Yes, that old chestnut. When I heard that Alexandre Aja was going to redo the film, I had high hopes - this despite the fact that he shot himself in the foot with the supremely nonsensical third act of High Tension. That aside, the break-in and murders in that film were truly horrifying in their frankness, and Aja outdoes them here. Unlike other slasher films where stupid teens are picked off one by one, I watched, stunned, during this version's massacre scene. Along with scenes from HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM and the motel room sequence in THE DEVIL'S REJECTS, this is what real horror should feel like - feeling the other characters' horror and more importantly, the unbelievable tragedy of a moment as it unfolds before you. The rest of the movie is no less brutal, but much more familiar stalker/revenge territory, and nowhere near as powerful as that one sequence.

I felt exhausted from the sand, dust blood and gore. It's gross and gory but if you like horror then this one will satisfy your craving du jour. I ended up chewing my gum so hard that I lost some filling in my back tooth, I blamed it on the intense scary parts but heck, I liked the movie; just don't eat while you're watching it.The premise is simple; a family on their way to California drives though the New Mexico desert but they end up blowing their tires and are stranded in the middle of nowhere. We can of course see that the ""accident"" was done on purpose, as someone laid a trap on them as they become prey to the mysterious inhabitants who survived the atomic bombs dropped in the test zones.What was hard to watch was the family itself. From the start they are likable bunch and you know sitting there that these people will start dying soon, and man I was biting my nails in worry for them. I felt dread and suspense though out the movie, and there was some screaming audience when the jumpy parts happened.Blood, guts, sweat, tears, cannibalism, gruesome mutations and struggle for survival were constant companions at this movie. I don't want to spoil too much, but the end was pretty good, although the characters made some false moves at least I didn't feel like I was watching some perfect set up where everyone executes the moves perfectly. Sure people dropped their weapons at the wrong time, and got trapped when they could have escaped, but this just made this movie more real. I must say that one of the dogs, the family had two German shepherds with them, was brilliant in it.

From ""The Fog"" to ""House of Wax"" to ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" it appears that Hollywood has run dry on original ideas.  One of the latest entries into the world of horror revisited is ""The Hills Have Eyes.""  This is one of the better remakes of recent years, but it lacks something that the original had:  Cheese.  With a bigger budget and relatively established actors, this remake just doesn't quite add up to the original.You're probably familiar with the story already, but here's a briefer for folks still undeducated:  A family decides to take a shortcut through the desert on their way to California.  BIG MISTAKE!  It seems that the government couldn't persuade a mining family to move out of the area before they began testing nukes and the result is a bunch of mutated inbreds are out for revenge.The story closely resembles the original (though in the original, the mutants were hungry cannibals).  It moves at a decent clip, but the actual ""terror"" scenes run too long and by the time they are finished, the shock value wears thin.  Director Alexandre Aja makes the same mistake that many other modern shock horror directors make:  He has people scream and flail around for way too long.  Just kill'em already!The original is much better.  It has a certain cheesey quality to it that none of today's rehashes have.  This remake, along with all of the others, is too slick and well-produced.  There's nothing appealing about them in the end.This is still one of the better remakes despite my many gripes.  If you enjoy films like ""Hostel,"" then you might like this flick.  However, if you want some really good horror, rent or buy the original version of this film.

986956,A1E85KPLPYVW8E,B000FAOC2M,"Kolors ""Jimmy""","[80, 107]","After Alexandre Aja more than proved to us that he can do horror like horror is supposed to be done with last year's release of High Tension, he comes back this year with a remake of Craven's classic The Hills Have Eyes. And this movie certainly has arrived. Aja's remake more than stands up to the original. The original was controversial for it's time, so this one can't be any less than that, and it isn't. You know you are seeing a real horror film when people walk out after a violent scene, and they did just that at my screening. I'd be lying if I told you this wasn't the goriest movie I've seen on the big screen, at least in my days as a movie-goer. As brutal as Hostel claimed itself to be (no diss on Hostel though, great movie in itself) it really isn't anything compared to this. This movie is just traumatic, blood-soaked, and distasteful, and I love it.And the movie just doesn't have gore to offer. The movie had  much better acting than what we are used to when it comes to films of this nature. The family seems like a real family. The way they interact with each other adds a sense of realism to the terror they are about to experience. The cinematography was really awesome as well. The killing sequences were creative, brutal and well thought out.

In fact, I thought this was the ""DUMBEST"" movie of all time, and you all can quote me on that. Frankly, the only thing I enjoyed about this movie were the row of guys sitting in front of my sister and I in the theatre cracking jokes. This is just another lame attempt to take the horror genre back to it's classic roots, and failing miserably at it. I guess that I'm just not as easily impressed as others. First of all, there is absolutely nothing scary about this, and it's sad when the dog is the most interesting character in the movie. I'm telling you, the dog is the star of the movie. It makes me angry because I kinda feel the same way about this movie that I felt about Hostel. The concept, basis, and ideas are awesome, but the movie is just poorly executed. The movie shows the aftermath of governmental testing of nuclear weapons. The consequences of these tests for the coal miner's who refused to abandon their homes and the area were that of severe abnormalities. The miner's who were exposed to the nuclear waste and radiation have become extremely deformed to the point they aren't even human anymore, and very cannabalistic. As a result, these mutated humans have resided in the ""Hills"" and mines of the area hunting and devouring everything and everyone passing through. This day a family taking a road trip to San Diego were passing through because they thought it was a shortcut, and once again, they become easy prey for these human-like monsters. There were so many directions they could've taken this idea because it's a kick @ss plot for a movie, but the way they went about it completely messed the whole thing up. One thing that made me angry is that the whole family basically gets killed in one fail swoop. I'm like...Are they just gonna kill everybody right now? For crying out loud, the father gets barbecued, the oldest daughter gets her head blown off, the mother gets blown away, and all at the same time. That only leaves, the oldest sister's husband who must now go on his quest to get his infant daughter back because the mutants have kidnapped her. The hot-headed younger brother, and the youngest sister. This girl whinned and sniveled basically the whole movie. I really wished that she would've went into survival mode and fought back like her brother-in-law who realized it was kill or be killed time.

986963,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000FAOC2M,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 5]","In the tragedies of ancient Greece the ""harmartia"" of the tragic hero usually involved an act of ""hubris,"" to show that once again pride goeth before the fall.  But the key part of the hero's tragic flow was that they had to be culpable in their own downfall, so that they were never the innocent victims of his fate.  There is something at work in horror films, especially of the splatter flick variety, in which the victims have to do something that dooms them to being sliced, diced and whatever the psychopaths that await them want to do to them.  In these films it is never pride that dooms them, but rather stupidity, often on a level of such sheer unbelievably that its only function is for you to want these people to die because they are literally too stupid to live.  For me the epitome of this in films of recent vintage was the remake of ""House of Wax,"" where Jared Padelicki's character sets a record for going into the wrong places time and time again until something really horrible happens to him.""The Hills Have Eyes"" starts off in a similar vein.  If you are driving across the Nevada desert and you stop at a gas station that is so old and decrepit that it must have been ten years since (a) they cleaned the place and (b) received a shipment of gas, and if the old coot (Tom Bower) that runs the place tells you there is a short cut to your destination, then how stupid do you have to be to take his advice?  Just to make things clear, you choice is between THE ONLY PAVED ROAD IN SIGHT and a dirt road that leads off into the hills.  To add insult to injury, the person making this decision, the father of this doomed little nuclear family happens to be an ex-cop.  The bad news is that he should know better, but the good news is that he has a gun.  Not that it will do him any god.The dirt road is a trap.  A car is never going to make it all the way down the road, which leads to a faux town that was built by the U.S. military to test what happens to buildings (and manikins) when exposed to one of the 300-plus nuclear blasts set off in the area.  The town was out of the blast radius, but not out of the range of the nuclear radiation.  So was the mining camp whose occupants refused to leave just because the government was setting off atomic bombs for several years.  Their descendants, a group of mutated and probably incestuous cannibals, are looking forward to their next meals.  That would be the family of Big Bob Carter (Ted Levine), his wife Ethel (Kathleen Quinlan), teenage son Bobby (Dan Byrd), youngest daughter Brenda (Emilie de Ravin), oldest daughter Lynn (Vinessa Shaw), her husband Doug (Aaron Stanford), and their baby Catharine (Maisie Camilleri Preziosi).The real nuclear family of this film consists of Papa Jupiter (Billy Drago), Big mama (Ivana Turchetto), Pluto (Michael Bailey Smith), Lizard (Robert Joy), Ruby (Laura Ortiz), Goggle (Ezra Buzzington), and Big Brain (Desmond Askew).  There are a couple of kids, the next generation of mutant cannibals as it were, but they do not take part in the festivities.  Having arranged for the Carters to be stuck in the desert, they wait for their victims to start going for help so they can be picked off one by one.  No matter what direction you go in these hills, you are doomed.  Doomed, do you hear me?  Doomed!  The only problem is that there is a baby involved, and why the guy stupid enough to drive down the dirt road might deserve this and the girls sunbathing themselves are inviting disaster, the same cannot be said for an innocent little baby.The most interesting thing about this movie is that over ninety percent of it takes place during the daytime, usually in the brightness of the desert sun.  Splatter flicks usually take place in the dark, but this is a movie that wants you to see what is going on most of time.  Director Alexandre Aja (""Haute tension"") and his constant co-writer Gregory Levasseur, take the original 1977 screenplay by Wes Craven and run with it.  Things are a bit slow at first, mainly because as long as the sun is up you can see the monsters are not out there waiting, while in the darkness it is much easier to imagine.  Once the blood and gore start being spilled things pick up and there are enough set pieces to whet your appetite, but I will fully admit that I rounded up on this one because the hero ends up being the character that is most like me (to wit, the one who really should have been the first to die).  I also appreciate that he follows my long held personal advice for people in such situations, which is to use any and all objects, both blunt and sharp, to kill the monsters and to never, ever think that one blow might be sufficient.  Finally, the film has a very appropriate final shot for the inevitable ""it is not really over"" bit that always comes at the end of splatter flicks.",4,"In the desert a doomed nuclear family runs into a really ""nuclear"" family",1150848000,"06 21, 2006",2006,4840,"['tragedies', 'ancient', 'Greece', 'harmartia', 'tragic', 'hero', 'usually', 'involved', 'act', 'hubris', 'show', 'once', 'again', 'pride', 'goeth', 'fall', 'key', 'part', 'hero', 'tragic', 'flow', 'was', 'had', 'be', 'culpable', 'own', 'downfall', 'were', 'never', 'innocent', 'victims', 'fate', 'something', 'work', 'horror', 'films', 'especially', 'splatter', 'flick', 'variety', 'victims', 'have', 'do', 'something', 'being', 'sliced', 'diced', 'psychopaths', 'await', 'want', 'do', 'films', 'never', 'pride', 'rather', 'stupidity', 'often', 'level', 'such', 'sheer', 'unbelievably', 'only', 'function', 'want', 'people', 'die', 'are', 'literally', 'too', 'stupid', 'live', 'epitome', 'films', 'recent', 'vintage', 'was', 'remake', 'House', 'Wax', 'where', 'Jared', 'Padelicki', 'character', 'record', 'going', 'wrong', 'places', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'something', 'really', 'horrible', 'happens', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'off', 'similar', 'vein', 'are', 'driving', 'Nevada', 'desert', 'stop', 'gas', 'station', 'so', 'old', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'ten', 'years', 'cleaned', 'place', 'b', 'received', 'shipment', 'gas', 'old', 'coot', 'Tom', 'Bower', 'place', 'short', 'cut', 'destination', 'then', 'how', 'stupid', 'do', 'have', 'be', 'take', 'advice', 'Just', 'make', 'things', 'clear', 'choice', 'THE', 'ONLY', 'PAVED', 'ROAD', 'IN', 'SIGHT', 'dirt', 'road', 'off', 'hills', 'add', 'insult', 'injury', 'person', 'making', 'decision', 'father', 'doomed', 'little', 'nuclear', 'family', 'be', 'ex-cop', 'bad', 'news', 'should', 'know', 'better', 'good', 'news', 'gun', 'Not', 'will', 'do', 'god.The', 'dirt', 'road', 'trap', 'car', 'never', 'going', 'make', 'way', 'road', 'faux', 'town', 'was', 'built', 'U.S.', 'military', 'test', 'what', 'buildings', 'manikins', 'when', 'exposed', 'one', '300-plus', 'nuclear', 'blasts', 'set', 'off', 'area', 'town', 'was', 'blast', 'radius', 'not', 'range', 'nuclear', 'radiation', 'was', 'mining', 'camp', 'occupants', 'refused', 'leave', 'just', 'government', 'was', 'setting', 'off', 'atomic', 'bombs', 'several', 'years', 'descendants', 'group', 'mutated', 'probably', 'incestuous', 'cannibals', 'are', 'looking', 'forward', 'next', 'meals', 'would', 'be', 'family', 'Big', 'Bob', 'Carter', 'Ted', 'Levine', 'wife', 'Ethel', 'Kathleen', 'Quinlan', 'teenage', 'son', 'Bobby', 'Dan', 'Byrd', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'Brenda', 'Emilie', 'de', 'Ravin', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'Lynn', 'Vinessa', 'Shaw', 'husband', 'Doug', 'Aaron', 'Stanford', 'baby', 'Catharine', 'Maisie', 'Camilleri', 'Preziosi', '.The', 'real', 'nuclear', 'family', 'film', 'Papa', 'Jupiter', 'Billy', 'Drago', 'Big', 'mama', 'Ivana', 'Turchetto', 'Pluto', 'Michael', 'Bailey', 'Smith', 'Lizard', 'Robert', 'Joy', 'Ruby', 'Laura', 'Ortiz', 'Goggle', 'Ezra', 'Buzzington', 'Big', 'Brain', 'Desmond', 'Askew', 'are', 'couple', 'kids', 'next', 'generation', 'mutant', 'cannibals', 'were', 'do', 'not', 'take', 'part', 'festivities', 'Having', 'arranged', 'Carters', 'be', 'stuck', 'desert', 'wait', 'victims', 'start', 'going', 'help', 'can', 'be', 'picked', 'one', 'one', 'matter', 'what', 'direction', 'go', 'hills', 'are', 'doomed', 'Doomed', 'do', 'hear', 'Doomed', 'only', 'problem', 'baby', 'involved', 'why', 'guy', 'stupid', 'enough', 'drive', 'down', 'dirt', 'road', 'might', 'deserve', 'girls', 'sunbathing', 'are', 'inviting', 'disaster', 'same', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'said', 'innocent', 'little', 'baby.The', 'most', 'interesting', 'thing', 'movie', 'percent', 'place', 'daytime', 'usually', 'brightness', 'desert', 'sun', 'Splatter', 'usually', 'take', 'place', 'dark', 'movie', 'see', 'what', 'going', 'most', 'time', 'Director', 'Alexandre', 'Aja', 'Haute', 'tension', 'constant', 'co-writer', 'Gregory', 'Levasseur', 'take', 'original', '1977', 'screenplay', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'run', 'Things', 'are', 'bit', 'slow', 'first', 'mainly', 'as', 'long', 'sun', 'can', 'see', 'monsters', 'are', 'not', 'there', 'waiting', 'darkness', 'much', 'easier', 'imagine', 'blood', 'gore', 'start', 'being', 'spilled', 'things', 'pick', 'up', 'are', 'enough', 'set', 'pieces', 'whet', 'appetite', 'will', 'fully', 'admit', 'rounded', 'up', 'one', 'hero', 'up', 'being', 'character', 'most', 'wit', 'one', 'who', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'first', 'die', 'also', 'appreciate', 'long', 'held', 'personal', 'advice', 'people', 'such', 'situations', 'use', 'objects', 'blunt', 'sharp', 'kill', 'monsters', 'never', 'ever', 'think', 'one', 'blow', 'might', 'be', 'sufficient', 'Finally', 'film', 'very', 'appropriate', 'final', 'shot', 'inevitable', 'not', 'really', 'bit', 'always', 'end', 'splatter', 'flicks']",The Hills Have Eyes

It doesn't even take a lot for me to love a movie, especially a horror movie. Ever since I was a little kid, I remember enjoying the feeling of jumping at the ""jump"" scares when the music stays quiet then suddenly gets loud at a surprise in the movie. It's a cheap trick, but it's fun for me, and I like the feeling of being surprised and scared at the same time. I also get a thrill from watching gory kill scenes (this dates back to my childhood, too, as I wasn't allowed to watch horror movies so there was an air of forbidden pleasure to them when my brother and I stayed up all night to watch the edited-for-television versions of cheesy 80s slasher flicks). When I decided to return to my hobby of watching horror movies as a college student, I was pleased to find the same enjoyment from my childhood, the same thrill, the same titillation at the nudity, the same camaraderie of joining with other fans to yell at the stupid people who go outside at night to investigate suspicious noises. Horror movies are fun, I have fun with them, and I don't apologize for loving even those movies that lots of critics hate because they're what I love, even in spite of their flaws. So really, it's nothing for me to say I love a horror movie because I love the genre as a whole. But it's one thing for me to love a movie and it's quite another for me to find a horror movie that makes me proud to be a horror fan, a movie that I discuss openly with people who aren't fellow horror fans because it's an example of what makes horror movies worth watching. Believe me, that doesn't happen very often.The Hills Have Eyes is an example of what makes horror movies worth watching.The opening credits do Wes Craven proud, because before he became a respected horror director, he loved screwing with people's minds and playing joyful music over a backdrop of disturbing images just because he CAN. He's forgotten some of what made that technique work, but the opening credits work here because unlike some other recent horror movies where the opening credit sequences give backstory with cheesy ""scary"" music, these opening credits are set to a backdrop of music from the era depicted in the newspaper headlines delivering the exposition. It's happy music with some stomach-turning and sad pictures, and that mix of emotions is unsettling enough to work. The family introduced at the beginning of the film is annoying without being clich&eacute;, and unlike some other annoying killer-fodder of late, they actually seem to CARE for and KNOW each other underneath the surface. They seem like a real family, so I cared about them. I wanted to beat them senseless for being stupid, but I didn't want them to die. And they weren't AS stupid as some characters. For instance, they didn't discover that someone intentionally drove them off the road yet decide to split up and go for help anyway like mental giants, they didn't know WHY their vehicle crashed, it just did, and it makes sense to have the two men split up and each go a different direction looking for help (why make the women walk, especially with a baby? And they had no clue anything was wrong yet except by natural and not human causes). It's a little thing, but I've come to appreciate the little touches like that; they help me enjoy the movie without developing a twitch in my eye and a sinking feeling in my stomach. The movie also pulls a little switch in that the character you expect to lead the pack for the rest of the movie is dispatched rather gruesomely, thus the others are justifiably in shock, and all their actions that might normally seem stupid make sense because they're too distracted by the shock of trying to take in all the crazy events and sudden emotions that they don't realize what's going on right away (just like real people). This is a refreshing change from characters that seem to suddenly become clairvoyant halfway through the film, performing astounding leaps of logic and figuring out every aspect of the killer's dastardly plan with ease instead of being burdened with pesky emotion over the loss of their loved ones to brutal deaths.Since I'm talking about characters, it would be a good time to sing the praises of the character development that had me shaking in my seat, restraining myself from jumping for joy. Because I'm a geek, I love subtext and I watch for it (and in my exuberance, I sometimes find it where it's not really there, I suspect) and I LOVE watching characters start out a certain way and then grow and change throughout the course of a story (especially when said development cements who they really ARE-I'll explain that in a moment). The best of the best horror movies either have characters becoming utterly insane as they break under the pressure or becoming stronger as they learn to adapt to it and use their pain to fuel their revenge and survival. Either scenario shows something that actually happens to real people in times of crisis, but many films opt for the photogenic hero who doesn't react to events or feel emotion, the one that simply moves and acts through events and walks through a hail of bullets without a scratch. Those kind of characters have their place, but it's much more rewarding to watch characters who actually limp, bleed, scar, and either keep going or break down-just because the actual terror and monsters in the world have the same affect on real people, and it's cathartic to watch movie characters going through something that affects them the way it would affect a real person in such a situation. These characters go through a steady mix of breaking down and becoming stronger, but it has an air of authenticity. The blows wound, the blades slash, the cuts bleed, the clothes tear...some of the pain inflicted was real enough not to make me turn away but to make me watch more closely, in awe of how real it seemed. THAT is something I don't see every day.What's more, the main character here goes through a spectacular change that had me covering my mouth to hold back cheers. This character starts out mildly annoying (though aesthetically pleasing...mmm, yummy) and seems weak, goes through some grief that's heart-wrenching, tries a stupid yet heroic move, seems at the point of failure...and then suddenly evolves into this feral FORCE that channels all the pain into a resolve and a strength that's so thrilling to watch it's orgasmic. Seriously, I've seen a transformation this powerful exactly four times in my life and each time, it cements the movie in my head as an almost religious experience (Just Before Dawn, 28 Days Later, Halloween, and now this movie). It's awesome to watch this character go from what the loudmouths behind me in the theater so eloquently dubbed a ""pussy"" to a genuine hero, and from that moment on (and it's a great, brutal, bloody moment) this movie had me by my nonexistent balls and NOTHING could tear my eyes from the screen. The development wasn't just from a weak character to a stronger character, it was from a wannabe-hero into the actual hero and leader he was supposed to be, and it worked, dammit. So well that even some of the final stupid horror character moves (hey, we think the villain is dead, let's drop a weapon near him and all turn our backs) can't take away the enjoyment of watching the final reels. I love gore, sadistic kills, tension, creepy music, creepy villains tormenting people cut off from the world who seem to have no way out. I love these aspect of horror so much that I enjoy watching them in movies, even when the movies aren't very good. The Hills Have Eyes is better than that. It doesn't just set up these elements, it reminds me why I love them. The setting truly is remote and there's a sense that even if the characters DO win their battle they might not survive and find help, but they try anyway, and that's powerful. The gore isn't just gooey and cool, it's actually DISTURBING and it made me watch in awe because at times it looked so real it was mesmerizing. The music was creepy but it worked WITH the scenes and acting and visuals, not FOR them (in other words, the scenes were already scary because of how they were set up, so the music just added to the tension instead of creating all the tension in an otherwise bland scene). The villains seemed superhuman and disturbing enough that they scared me, and even when one character starts giving the standard ""This is why we're killing you"" speech, it doesn't make me throw bricks at the screen because I care enough about the character who's in danger that I ignore the annoyance and focus on him. The movie's so good that I don't have to FIND the good in it, it's just there for me to see, and it's a rare pleasure to see that in horror movies these days. It doesn't break new ground or try to impress me with bells and whistles, jumping around like a hyperactive kid screaming ""Look at what I can do!"" It takes known, trusted horror elements and shows me anew why they work so well. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen because the movie set up the characters, set up the situation, delivered the gore, made me care, held my interest, let its characters grow and change, and built so much tension that I bit my nails off while waiting for a climax that didn't let me down and satisfied me EVEN THOUGH I SAW IT ALL COMING. That's not hard, it's nearly impossible. But it happened.The Bottom Line: Were there stupid moments? Of course there were. But these didn't bother me, because the movie was high quality and it held together so well that the flaws didn't matter. I didn't enjoy the movie in spite of them, I enjoyed the movie and barely noticed them because the rest of the package was so good. In other words, this wasn't a picnic lunch where I stopped eating when I saw ants on my food but was still glad I came because I like picnics, it's one where the food was so good I picked the ants off and ate anyway because it was worth eating.Overall: 9.5/10 God bless you, Alxandre Aja.

986967,A22RE7V8QZFICW,B000FAOC2M,Lizard,"[7, 23]","The original movie was far superior to this movie. The original relied more on plot and suspense than on ""cheap-thrill gore"" and loud noises to drum up a scare which is the only thing that keeps this movie going.The first half hour of this awful remake is hopleless boring. I yawned five times.  A travel trailer in the middle of a desert and a group of people just complaining about their trip, and I was thinking why am I watching this.Aside from boring script and plot, there are short bursts of exciting gore. Then it's back to boring script. Overall the movie was completely unbelievable.(1) Exciting scene #1: A guy sees a bunch of cars, then sees this old crazy man who shoots his head off. Well it's just as well he's out of the movie since this old guy got on my nerves.  And then the wandering guy gets his head slammed against glass and gets toted away. About a minute of good script...then back to utter boredom. The others in the trailer are completely oblivous something is wrong. So you have 45 minutes of utterly boring movie...Other shortcomings:(1a) Depicts cruelty to animals which I found most distasteful.I like good gory movies, but NEVER depicting cruelty to animals, which crosses over into the realm of pure sick perversiveness.Inconsistencies: One german sheppard pet gets killed...then another one shows up? where did he come from?THe Massacre: about 50 minutes into the movie before something ""good"" happens: the goons invade the trailer. One lovebird gets his head bitten off and goon squeezes the bird's body to drink its blood and guts. Really sick folks to resort to this outright animal cruelty.A girl gets raped; most of the family is killed, and the guy who was dragged off we see him getting burned alive. About 10 minutes of action scene, then it suddenly gets boring again. In fact, the acting gets pretty corny.You have to wait through another ***40  minutes** of PURE BOREDOM before something happens again. The german sheppard (that mysteriously shows up) becomes a hero and kills two goons, which is completely unbelieveable.(3) Some of the actors at times gets very drama-the swear words sounds sooo idiotic and corn off the cob; sounds quite silly. This one guy swears and screams like a girl..I'm like come on folks HOW did this guy get the job.Makeup/costumes: The goons' faces look like plastic-obvious plastic. Cheap made. You can do just as good in a five-and-dime store. Even the corpses and pieces (arms, legs, etc.) appears to be rubbery plastic materials. Not at all realistic.Would I buy this movie? No way! It's MILDLY okay to rent though, but I say this with hesitancy.  The gore is sometimes good, but I seen better in B-grade movies, and you have to wait through A LOT of boring script and bad overacting to get to those scenes. The only interesting thing about the movie are those gore scenes and that's it, and that adds up to about a few minutes at best.Poor story, complete reliance for ""cheap gore"" scenes.

986977,A3R4ZEDVRUWJNO,B000FAOC2M,Mark,"[6, 21]","Last year's gruesome flick Wolf Creek was on my Worst of 2005 list debuting at an astounding #2, but, while it was bad, it in no way shape or form equals the awfulness of The Hills Have Eyes.  See, at least in Wolf Creek, there was not even a shard of an attempt at character development, so it was basically a slaughterfest of characters I never really got the time to know.  The Hills Have Eyes doesn't really get started until about forty-five minutes into the film, lending the viewer an insight into what probably could be considered the stupidest family in all of film history.  The film is basically a retread of the original, beefed up in effects for shock value, and it does nothing with the writing of the original, except reaffirm that these characters are dumb.  The film is essentially a horror film created with a mold of every other horror film ever made.  A family on vacation to San Diego in their motorhome takes a detour through the New Mexico desert (shocker).  They wind up lost and ask for directions from the sketchy gas station attendant (again, a shocker) who tells them to take the road that's not on the map (do I even have to say it), and they listen (...).  They soon find themselves with four flat tires and stranded in the middle of nowhere.  By this point, I was repeatedly punching myself in the face because it was less painful.  I know it probably isn't a good thing for a film reviewer to say something like that, but I have to explain how bad this film is.  As of right now, just in thinking about this film, my right fist is trembling as I try not to strike myself.  Anyway, back to the plot.  Wait.  Do I have to go on?  Right now, with the information you've been given about the plot, you should be able to determine what the rest of the film will entail.  Well for those who are still reading this, I will be courteous enough to continue.  The father of the family, only known as Big Bob (clever) goes off in one direction in search of the gas station and Doug, who is engaged (or perhaps married) to Big Bob's daughter, heads in the other direction in search of another road.  Bob, who is a retired police officer, arrives at the gas station in the middle of the night to find it near deserted.  Or so he thinks.  At the first sign of noise, Bob (an ex-cop mind you) starts firing rounds from his .357 Magnum towards every direction.  At this point in the film, my nose was broken and my mind was completely gone.  Mutants attack the remaining part of the family in the camper and steal Doug's baby.  At the first sign of one of the mutants, I wanted to call Steven Spielberg and Richard Donner and tell them that Alexandre Aja had stolen Sloth from The Goonies and put him in their film, but, alas, I didn't have their phone number.  Doug goes on a rampage to find his baby and gets into a large bloodbath with an ending that is, to say, less than rewarding.  The credits came just as I was getting the noose ready, and then I miraculously got my mind back and returned to normal.  Not one moment of the film is original.  The Hills Have Eyes has reached its mutant hands around a few big name critics who have hailed this film as a refreshment from other horror flicks.  I have news for them.  The Hills Have Eyes is a stupid, predictible film about a stupid, predictible family on their stupid, predictible family vacation to the stupid, predictible middle of nowhere.  The ending leaves room for a sequel, but there was already a film called The Hills Have Eyes 2.  So will it be a sequel of the remake of the original? Or will it be a remake of the sequel of the original?  Let's hope we won't have to find out.  It's a film that has absolutely no entertainment value and should not be watched by people who are suicidal.  It'll only make it worse.  For those of you on the border of depressed and suicidal, this film should give you more than enough reason to cross the border and make the jump.",1,"Wolf Creek, Eat Your Heart Out",1151280000,"06 26, 2006",2006,3944,"['Last', 'year', 'gruesome', 'flick', 'Wolf', 'Creek', 'was', 'Worst', '2005', 'list', 'debuting', 'astounding', '2', 'was', 'bad', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'equals', 'awfulness', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'See', 'least', 'Wolf', 'Creek', 'was', 'not', 'even', 'shard', 'attempt', 'character', 'development', 'was', 'basically', 'slaughterfest', 'characters', 'never', 'really', 'got', 'time', 'know', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'started', 'forty-five', 'minutes', 'film', 'lending', 'viewer', 'insight', 'what', 'probably', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'stupidest', 'family', 'film', 'history', 'film', 'basically', 'retread', 'original', 'beefed', 'up', 'effects', 'shock', 'value', 'nothing', 'writing', 'original', 'reaffirm', 'characters', 'are', 'dumb', 'film', 'essentially', 'horror', 'film', 'created', 'mold', 'other', 'horror', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'A', 'family', 'vacation', 'San', 'Diego', 'motorhome', 'detour', 'New', 'Mexico', 'desert', 'shocker', 'wind', 'up', 'lost', 'ask', 'directions', 'sketchy', 'gas', 'station', 'attendant', 'again', 'shocker', 'who', 'take', 'road', 'not', 'map', 'do', 'even', 'have', 'say', 'listen', 'soon', 'find', 'four', 'flat', 'tires', 'stranded', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'point', 'was', 'repeatedly', 'punching', 'face', 'was', 'less', 'painful', 'know', 'probably', ""n't"", 'good', 'thing', 'film', 'reviewer', 'say', 'something', 'have', 'explain', 'how', 'bad', 'film', 'right', 'now', 'just', 'thinking', 'film', 'right', 'fist', 'trembling', 'try', 'not', 'strike', 'Anyway', 'back', 'plot', 'Wait', 'Do', 'have', 'go', 'Right', 'now', 'information', ""'ve"", 'been', 'given', 'plot', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'determine', 'what', 'rest', 'film', 'will', 'entail', 'Well', 'who', 'are', 'still', 'reading', 'will', 'be', 'courteous', 'enough', 'continue', 'father', 'family', 'only', 'known', 'Big', 'Bob', 'clever', 'one', 'direction', 'search', 'gas', 'station', 'Doug', 'who', 'engaged', 'perhaps', 'married', 'Big', 'Bob', 'daughter', 'heads', 'other', 'direction', 'search', 'road', 'Bob', 'who', 'retired', 'police', 'officer', 'gas', 'station', 'middle', 'night', 'find', 'deserted', 'so', 'first', 'sign', 'noise', 'Bob', 'ex-cop', 'mind', 'firing', 'rounds', '.357', 'Magnum', 'towards', 'direction', 'point', 'film', 'nose', 'was', 'broken', 'mind', 'was', 'completely', 'gone', 'Mutants', 'attack', 'remaining', 'part', 'family', 'camper', 'steal', 'Doug', 'baby', 'first', 'sign', 'one', 'mutants', 'wanted', 'call', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'tell', 'Alexandre', 'Aja', 'had', 'stolen', 'Sloth', 'Goonies', 'put', 'film', 'alas', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'phone', 'number', 'Doug', 'rampage', 'find', 'baby', 'large', 'bloodbath', 'ending', 'say', 'less', 'rewarding', 'credits', 'came', 'just', 'was', 'getting', 'noose', 'ready', 'then', 'miraculously', 'got', 'mind', 'back', 'returned', 'normal', 'Not', 'one', 'moment', 'film', 'original', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'reached', 'mutant', 'hands', 'few', 'big', 'name', 'critics', 'who', 'have', 'hailed', 'film', 'refreshment', 'other', 'horror', 'flicks', 'have', 'news', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'stupid', 'predictible', 'film', 'stupid', 'predictible', 'family', 'stupid', 'predictible', 'family', 'vacation', 'stupid', 'predictible', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'ending', 'leaves', 'room', 'sequel', 'there', 'was', 'already', 'film', 'called', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', '2', 'So', 'will', 'be', 'sequel', 'remake', 'original', 'will', 'be', 'remake', 'sequel', 'original', 'Let', 'hope', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'find', 'out', 'film', 'absolutely', 'entertainment', 'value', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'watched', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'suicidal', ""'ll"", 'only', 'make', 'worse', 'border', 'depressed', 'suicidal', 'film', 'should', 'give', 'more', 'enough', 'reason', 'cross', 'border', 'make', 'jump']",The Hills Have Eyes
986978,AQCH8SYTDL23W,B000FAOC2M,Mark It Zero,"[1, 2]","Having the mentality of most people who find out one of their favorite films is being remade (a recent blow to the stomach came in the form of the annoucement of an Ikiru, American, remake,) I had no interest in seeing this film.  Top that off with the fact that I think High Tension was one of the worst films I'd seen in recent years, my want to see The Hills Have Eyes barely existed.But the more I thought about it, the more my interest peaked.  Craven himself handpicked Aja to remake his cult classic, and Craven being one of my favorite horror directors (I can forgive the man for the last, say, 12 years of his career because he made Last House on the Left, the Hills Have Eyes, the Serpent and the Rainbow and Nightmare on Elm Street.) I ended up giving his choice the benefit of the doubt.The remake, although a great piece of unsettling horror, does have some major flaws.  One, and, for me, the one that stood out the most, was the music.  Holy s*it, why does a horror film, one that's supposed to be at least semi-realistic, need some pseudoheroic Michael Bay-film soundtrack?  Why not just use the soundtrack naturally created by the landscape?  The other part I have to spit some venom at is the, obviously studio forced, tacked on happy ""family reunion"" ending.  That's one of the things I adore about the original, he got his child back and it ended.  In Aja's remake the film is pointlessly drawn out with an extra 5-6 minutes of the family's recovergence.Other than those two complaints, I can safely say that I was absolutely, albeit pleasently, shocked to find myself on the positive end of the spectrum once the film came to a close.And 10 cool points to Aja for the Straw Dogs picking-up-the-broken-glasses-and-putting-them-back-on-during-a-raid reference.",4,Surprisingly enjoyable remake of one of my all time favorite horrors,1149552000,"06 6, 2006",2006,1779,"['Having', 'mentality', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'find', 'out', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'being', 'remade', 'recent', 'blow', 'stomach', 'came', 'form', 'annoucement', 'Ikiru', 'American', 'remake', 'had', 'interest', 'seeing', 'film', 'Top', 'off', 'fact', 'think', 'High', 'Tension', 'was', 'one', 'worst', 'films', ""'d"", 'seen', 'recent', 'years', 'want', 'see', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'barely', 'existed.But', 'more', 'thought', 'more', 'interest', 'peaked', 'Craven', 'handpicked', 'Aja', 'remake', 'cult', 'classic', 'Craven', 'being', 'one', 'favorite', 'horror', 'directors', 'can', 'forgive', 'man', 'last', 'say', '12', 'years', 'career', 'made', 'Last', 'House', 'Left', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'Serpent', 'Rainbow', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'ended', 'up', 'giving', 'choice', 'benefit', 'doubt.The', 'remake', 'great', 'piece', 'unsettling', 'horror', 'have', 'major', 'flaws', 'One', 'one', 'stood', 'out', 'most', 'was', 'music', 'Holy', 's*it', 'why', 'horror', 'film', 'one', 'supposed', 'be', 'least', 'semi-realistic', 'need', 'pseudoheroic', 'Michael', 'Bay-film', 'soundtrack', 'Why', 'not', 'just', 'use', 'soundtrack', 'naturally', 'created', 'landscape', 'other', 'part', 'have', 'spit', 'venom', 'obviously', 'studio', 'forced', 'tacked', 'happy', 'family', 'reunion', 'ending', 'one', 'things', 'adore', 'original', 'got', 'child', 'back', 'ended', 'Aja', 'remake', 'film', 'pointlessly', 'drawn', 'out', 'extra', '5-6', 'minutes', 'family', 'recovergence.Other', 'two', 'complaints', 'can', 'safely', 'say', 'was', 'absolutely', 'albeit', 'pleasently', 'shocked', 'find', 'positive', 'end', 'spectrum', 'film', 'came', 'close.And', '10', 'cool', 'points', 'Aja', 'Straw', 'Dogs', 'picking-up-the-broken-glasses-and-putting-them-back-on-during-a-raid', 'reference']",The Hills Have Eyes

Example(s) The Fog-Dang! that movie sucked! The Amityville horror-Holy CACA! And more recently on the big screen The Omen(waiting for dvd release to watch).  This time Alenxandre Aja takes a stab at Wes Cravens the hills have eyes. Being a big horror film fan sure good splatter is always good but even better is when it looks believable by way of good acting. Heres a quick breakdown;  What happens when a family of six an infant and two german shepards named beauty and Beast take a short cut through the desert? Sabotage!Mutants from an old mining community who have fallen victim to nuclear weapon test radiation send the family on a journey into the realm of wierd, what the @*#&%! terror!  Never did I see a group of people go through that kind of crap in a horror movie(lately).  True the film kind of reminded me of ""Wrong Turn"" only desert style.  But the Gory scenes only accentuated the disturbing situations in this film. Rape, plus one of the mutants gets in a little breast feeding action while moms got a bullet in her, sis is being subdued and the infant has a gun trained on it.On a more personal note, I know a lot a people that couldn't finish watching this film because of the Rape scene and the fact that the infant had its life in danger several times. Yes it was tense in those moments in the film but not totally unwatchable...

The pace then slows for a bit, but picks up again with the trailer attack. This scene is hectic, disturbing and relentless. The pace doesn't slow much after this point. There are some insane scenes with the mutated freaks of the New Mexico desert.I feel the film was done very well. There is a good sense of tension and dispair throughout the movie. The characters are not that well-developed, but they don't have to be for the purposes of this movie. You go through not feeling any kind of connection to any characters, which actually helps the purpose of the story. Overall, I like the feel of the movie. The characters in the family are stranded in the middle of the desert, being stalked by mutant recluses. You can feel the isolation and freakiness of the situation.The movie was far better than I was expecting it to be.

I didn't know it was a remake, I didn't know who was in it, I didn't even see the poster, or a review for it. I did find a reasonably good review for it, and although I soon discovered I'd be hiding behind my hands for most of it.When in fact, I only hid behind my hands once, and I barely managed it, before they were dragged away from my face. Most of the time, I could see it was coming, or I only briefly turned my face away from the screen. I've had budgies since I was young, and that's all I will say without spoiling anything.I quite liked the family in this, apart from the guy, played by Dan Byrd. This is Emile de Ravin's first big screen role after becoming a star in Lost, as pregnant Australian Claire. She & the actress who plays her sister, get subjected to some brutal rape scenes in this, although most of it is left to the imagination. But where the mutant goes to actually breastfeed from her, that totally gave me the creeps. I don't know why I get so freaked out about that, the whole sucking on the nipple scene in Hollow Man freaked me out as well. No one is coming near that area of my body for a while, without that scene coming to my head.There are quite a few scares in this, but they're either predictable, or highly cliched - for example, the ancient gas station attendant. How often is this going to be done? A car breaking down when you're on a road trip? Anything more original? The mutants (although they totally reminded me of the mutants from Wrong Turn) were certainly eye-averting, especially the one with the massive head. Hydrocephalous? (Now I'm sure that's not spelt right.)I would have liked to have seen more of the mutant family, what happened in more detail, but unfortunately that doesn't happen. They just didn't feel like real characters, which sounds stupid, but I know what I mean.I'm still not sure what to feel about this movie. I was asked why I hadn't done a review for it yet, and I said I couldn't think of a way to start it. When I feel indifferent about a film, I have severe trouble writing a review about it. I'm still in two minds about it, and have forgotten a lot of it already, despite only seeing it two days ago, apart from the rape scenes.",2,We need to have half marks on this,1142380800,"03 15, 2006",2006,2297,"[""'d"", 'previously', 'seen', 'nothing', 'being', 'asked', 'go', 'cinema', 'see', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'remake', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'see', 'poster', 'review', 'did', 'find', 'reasonably', 'good', 'review', 'soon', 'discovered', ""'d"", 'be', 'hiding', 'hands', 'most', 'it.When', 'fact', 'only', 'hid', 'hands', 'once', 'barely', 'managed', 'were', 'dragged', 'away', 'face', 'Most', 'time', 'could', 'see', 'was', 'coming', 'only', 'briefly', 'turned', 'face', 'away', 'screen', ""'ve"", 'had', 'budgies', 'was', 'young', 'will', 'say', 'spoiling', 'anything.I', 'quite', 'liked', 'family', 'apart', 'guy', 'played', 'Dan', 'Byrd', 'Emile', 'Ravin', 'first', 'big', 'screen', 'role', 'becoming', 'star', 'Lost', 'pregnant', 'Australian', 'Claire', 'actress', 'who', 'sister', 'get', 'subjected', 'brutal', 'rape', 'scenes', 'most', 'left', 'imagination', 'where', 'mutant', 'actually', 'breastfeed', 'totally', 'gave', 'creeps', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'get', 'so', 'freaked', 'out', 'whole', 'sucking', 'nipple', 'scene', 'Hollow', 'Man', 'freaked', 'out', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'coming', 'area', 'body', 'while', 'scene', 'coming', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'scares', ""'re"", 'predictable', 'highly', 'cliched', 'example', 'ancient', 'gas', 'station', 'attendant', 'How', 'often', 'going', 'be', 'done', 'car', 'breaking', 'down', 'when', ""'re"", 'road', 'trip', 'Anything', 'more', 'original', 'mutants', 'totally', 'reminded', 'mutants', 'Wrong', 'Turn', 'were', 'certainly', 'eye-averting', 'especially', 'one', 'massive', 'head', 'Hydrocephalous', 'Now', ""'m"", 'sure', 'not', 'spelt', 'right', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'mutant', 'family', 'what', 'happened', 'more', 'detail', 'unfortunately', ""n't"", 'happen', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'real', 'characters', 'stupid', 'know', 'what', 'mean.I', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'feel', 'movie', 'was', 'asked', 'why', 'had', ""n't"", 'done', 'review', 'yet', 'said', 'could', ""n't"", 'think', 'way', 'start', 'When', 'feel', 'indifferent', 'film', 'have', 'severe', 'trouble', 'writing', 'review', ""'m"", 'still', 'two', 'minds', 'have', 'forgotten', 'lot', 'already', 'only', 'seeing', 'two', 'days', 'ago', 'apart', 'rape', 'scenes']",The Hills Have Eyes

This one obviously dosen't belong to that category.  It is really ""great"" to watch if you can get rid of every possible logical and coherent thought!!!I mean, come on what kind of a silly, absolutely unrealistic plot do we have here:  Humans, or rather now, zombies stalking innocent victims in the desert.  That by itself may not be that far fetched, but hold on, here comes the kicker, these zombies are people that refused to leave there mines (where they worked) when the US government decided to test atomic weapons there in the 50's or 60's.  Could any of them have survived these atomic explosions??  The obvious answer is a big NO !!  But it gets even better, because these zombies are not alone, by the way they look like they are all beyond their 50s, no they even have children.  Man, this is really too much, who comes up with such utter non-sense?And the plot of the movie isen't exactly much better.  Apparently these zombies, who live in the middle of a desert !!!, survive by occasionally attacking people who try to pass through the area.  I guess, they are then also cannibals.  But if one gives it one logical thought, then we are forced to question ourselves, who would not only drive through that desert but become such an easy victim?  This could only happen if transportation vehicles of all sorts would continuously break down while passing through that zombie infested area, and if this usually deserted area was just overrun by people passing through it.  Not very likely dear producers!Well, I won't get into the graphic violence and all that (others have done that enough), for me the movie died quickly along with its huge logical mistakes, that were so big that one could drive trucks through them.Hence, only a movie for 5 year olds, and those that like to lose their thinking ability during movies.

This new version starts of like the original with a nice family on vaction, they're quickly interrupted when they take shortcut advice from an inbred gas station attendant. Once stranded in the middle of a remote desert, horrible things beyond mosts imaginations begin to happen. If you think you'll have trouble watching an innocent family fall victim to desert hill inbreds you shouldnt watch this film. Director Alexandre Aja shows you everything, never holding anything back from the camera lens, especially in this unrated dvd version. There is torture, rape, violent murders all a little more graphic in this version that was not shown in theaters. Little is left to your imagination.. Aja's lays it all out in the open and doesnt apologize! I actually read a review where a girl that had been sexually asulted by her father became ill while watching a certain scene in this film, she stated that she almost had to go to the hospital because she couldnt breathe after it brought back painful memories.. I think its pretty sad because, she complained that the movie didnt come with a ""rape warning"".. I'm sorry but if you're that fragile you shouldnt be watching unrated horror films. I ..on the other hand can't wait to see what this aspiring filmmaker has up his sleeve for us next!",5,A gore fans bloody dream!!!

986997,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B000FAOC2M,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[3, 3]","Turns out that Alexandre Aja's international hit High Tension was only a taste of things to come.  When I first heard of the announcement of a remake of Wes Craven's the Hills Have Eyes, let's just say that I wasn't very thrilled, even with Craven and original producer Peter Locke producing it.  Movies in general these days don't offer much in originality.  We have the old TV show to film adaptations, comic book to film adaptations, and the ever popular, and mostly ever dreadful, horror film remakes.  However, Aja has done something here that was unexpected: he's re-made a classic horror film that is faithful to the original, and it doesn't hold back as it successfully retains the tone and ferocity of the original film.  The storyline remains the same: a bickering family makes their way through the desert on their way to California, but get waylaid by a trap set by a mutated, cannibalistic family who proceed to terrorize and kill them, as well as kidnap their young baby.  As many of the family members die, the pacifist son-in-law (X-Men: The Last Stand's Aaron Stanford) must become every bit as savage as the attackers to survive.  The film has a lot going for it right off the bat: Aja isn't afraid to show almost every uneasy aspect of human savagry as the blood and gore gets piled on, and it's refreshing that his screenplay is so faithful to the original.  The highlight of the film is undoubtadly the grotesque and imaginitive makeup effects by industry legends Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger, who manage to provide some memorable monsters, but strangely none that are as imposing as Michael Berryman.  The film's cast, including Lost's Emilie De Ravin, Land of the Dead's Robert Joy (once again under heavy makeup), genre stalwart Billy Drago, and Kathleen Quinlan and Ted Levine as the ill-fated mother and father, do solid work.  All in all, if you loved the original film and are leary of this remake, fear not.  Alexandre Aja has crafted a more than solid remake of a classic horror film, and with this and High Tension under his belt, we may very well be on the verge of seeing the making of a master of the genre.",4,"""It's breakfast time!""",1151107200,"06 24, 2006",2006,2144,"['out', 'Alexandre', 'Aja', 'international', 'hit', 'High', 'Tension', 'was', 'only', 'taste', 'things', 'come', 'When', 'first', 'heard', 'announcement', 'remake', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'thrilled', 'even', 'Craven', 'original', 'producer', 'Peter', 'Locke', 'producing', 'Movies', 'general', 'days', 'do', ""n't"", 'offer', 'much', 'originality', 'have', 'old', 'TV', 'show', 'film', 'adaptations', 'comic', 'book', 'film', 'adaptations', 'ever', 'popular', 'mostly', 'ever', 'dreadful', 'horror', 'film', 'remakes', 'However', 'Aja', 'done', 'something', 'here', 'was', 'unexpected', 're-made', 'classic', 'horror', 'film', 'faithful', 'original', ""n't"", 'hold', 'back', 'successfully', 'tone', 'ferocity', 'original', 'film', 'storyline', 'same', 'bickering', 'family', 'way', 'desert', 'way', 'California', 'get', 'waylaid', 'trap', 'set', 'mutated', 'cannibalistic', 'family', 'who', 'proceed', 'terrorize', 'kill', 'as', 'well', 'kidnap', 'young', 'baby', 'many', 'family', 'members', 'die', 'pacifist', 'son-in-law', 'X-Men', 'Last', 'Stand', 'Aaron', 'Stanford', 'must', 'become', 'bit', 'as', 'savage', 'attackers', 'survive', 'film', 'lot', 'going', 'right', 'off', 'bat', 'Aja', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'show', 'almost', 'uneasy', 'aspect', 'human', 'savagry', 'blood', 'gore', 'piled', 'refreshing', 'screenplay', 'so', 'faithful', 'original', 'highlight', 'film', 'undoubtadly', 'grotesque', 'imaginitive', 'makeup', 'effects', 'industry', 'legends', 'Greg', 'Nicotero', 'Howard', 'Berger', 'who', 'manage', 'provide', 'memorable', 'monsters', 'strangely', 'none', 'are', 'as', 'imposing', 'Michael', 'Berryman', 'film', 'cast', 'including', 'Lost', 'Emilie', 'De', 'Ravin', 'Land', 'Dead', 'Robert', 'Joy', 'once', 'again', 'heavy', 'makeup', 'genre', 'stalwart', 'Billy', 'Drago', 'Kathleen', 'Quinlan', 'Ted', 'Levine', 'ill-fated', 'mother', 'father', 'do', 'solid', 'work', 'loved', 'original', 'film', 'are', 'leary', 'remake', 'fear', 'not', 'Alexandre', 'Aja', 'crafted', 'more', 'solid', 'remake', 'classic', 'horror', 'film', 'High', 'Tension', 'belt', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'verge', 'seeing', 'making', 'master', 'genre']",The Hills Have Eyes

This is a remake of a movie that Wes Craven made years ago, but I never saw it so my review is going to be focused on the movie itself, and not compare it to the original. This movie takes you on a journey that one family takes on the road to survival. The choices they make, and what the conversations they have makes sense most of the time. You do have them sometimes making stupid decisions, but it would change the entire movie if they made them.The gore in this movie is intense; at the last half of the movie you see a lot of it and it looks real, not that fake looking stuff. The location the movie takes place is bleak, but also unique at the same time. You feel like this is an actual location, which makes the movie feel even more real. It also makes you jump at times, which few movies do correctly. Pacing is good at times, and it doesn't seem like it started off slow since the story sucked you in from the beginning scene.Most of the music in the movie is played well and feels like it fits in when it comes up. Also the way the characters change based on the experiences they have is a nice effect as well. The look of the antagonists themselves is made believable and doesn't make it seem they are wearing prosthetics.The Special features are enjoyable, and overall you have about an hour of behind the scenes footage, with some footage from the movie shown during it.

987003,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B000FAOC2M,Only-A-Child,"[0, 0]","Viewers will be happy to know that the remake of 1977's ""The Hills Have Eyes"" maintains the hokey fake binocular point of view device. Ever notice how those two circles with the black borders used for movie POV purposes are not what you actually see when you look through a pair of binoculars (there are no circle in there).I had the luxury of watching the two films at the same time. I would run 15 minutes of the remake first and then she same15 minutes of the original. Roger Ebert contends that it is a loose re-make; I disagreed until well past the midway point of the story. Until then it pretty much followed things scene for scene, with minor updates to reflect 2006 rather than 1977. The bill for a tank of gas was under $10 in the original.They chose to alter the back-story; in the original the gas station owner had spawned the original creature back before WWII and he tries to persuade the family to stay on the main road. In the remake the creatures are products of atomic testing and the gas station owner is paid by them to divert people off the main road. The introduction of the old atomic testing device allows the production design people to create a government built fake town left over from the testing. It is populated with old mannequins originally placed there to show the effects of a nuclear blast. This set is a nice addition to the original and the biggest deviation or the remake.Not so effective is a ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" field of abandoned cars and trucks (belonging to prior victims); mostly because the device has become almost obligatory to these familial horror stories (insert ""Wrong Turn"" here). In the original this was an off camera Air Force dump site from which the son-in-law salvaged some equipment. Making this a textbook example of why showing nothing is sometimes better showing something.My reaction until well after the midpoint was that the remake was better. It was very respectful of original and the higher budget and technical improvements meant better film stock, more elaborate camera work, and better audio. Neither cast is exactly full of heavyweight talent. The new higher budgeted group might actually be more talented but Craven is a much better acting for the camera director than Aja; so the acting advantage clearly goes to the original (who also seemed to be having a lot more fun with their material).The remake falters (relative to the original anyway) for the last third of the film. In large part this is because Aja failed early on to define and adequately develop personalities for the mutant family. This was the real strength of the original as the family in the hills was quickly identified and their internal relationships developed. They took a gleeful pleasure in their mayhem and Craven kept them in character throughout the production. The remake is inconsistent, at times it tries to make them more sympathetic and at other times more primitive and savage. Plus it adds a non-ambulatory character like that in ""TCM"" and ""Monster Man"". Unfortunately here he serves no purpose other than as an excuse to employ more people in the make-up unit.Finally, the remake lacks the original's best visual image, Michael Berryman's hairless asymmetrical head which was featured on the poster and video cover art. Berrymore's characterization of ""Pluto""  became a cult figure with his groveling and whining. Michael Bailey Smith's new ""Pluto"" does not begin to measure up to Berryman's.

It seems hollywood is trying to squeeze every drop out of the horror industry. But finally, something impressive has been presented by a very talented and impressive director. With a surprisingly good cast and clever script, this movie isn't just blood and guts.Yes, you may have heard at the water cooler that the Hills Have Eyes was one of the most pointlessly violent movies of all time. But, is what's behind the horror and blood a movie of gold? In my opinion, it is. I have to say that I'm a huge fan of Ted Levine and seeing him in any role is fun. He just brings a great presence to the screen. Aaron Stanford(Doug) has the most impressive and surprising role as the protagonist of the story. Unlike in most horror films, the teenagers are done very well. They never come off as annoying or stupid. Credit goes to Dan Byrd and Emilie de Ravin for their excellent performances.Director Alexandre Aja (High Tension and The Hills Have Eyes) has become one of the most promising directors in hollywood. I didn't enjoy High Tension that much, but his sense of style and direction is excellent. I have high hopes.If your a fan of the original then this film should please you. It does justice to the original. But, if your not a fan of the original, you should still enjoy this one very much.

Which begs the question: why is it that directors will produce remakes of their own films almost guaranteed to not hold a candle to the originals? Alexandre Aja (Haute Tension)'s remake of The Hills Have Eyes, produced by Craven, is far, far better than last year's awful remake of The Fog, but when it comes right down to it, ten times nothing is still nothing.The plot, for those of you who somehow missed the original: modern American extended family get themselves stranded in the desert miles from nowhere and find themselves facing another family, this one of savages. Cue survival thriller.I could rewrite a good portion of my Dark Water review for this one. The first eighty-five minutes or thereabouts of the film could be a textbook in how to create a remake. There are similarities, but Aja and Levasseur took the original source material and made it their own. There were some trade-offs that worked like a charm and some that didn't (most notably in the latter camp, the setup focused on characterizing the ""modern"" family at the expense of characterizing the ""savage"" family), but in general, looked at as its own beast rather than a remake, it was holding up quite nicely. The one parallel that wasn't working was Doug (X2's Aaron Stanford, sporting scary-looking facial hair), whose transformation in the original film from hippie peacenik to violent survivalist was one of the best bits of subtext to be found there-- but then, I figured, if they were planning on changing the whole schlemiel anyway, why not mess with Doug?Then, however, the whole thing became a sudden mess. We were transported from the creepy Wes Craven-inspired world into something that wouldn't have seemed terribly out of place in an Arnold Schwarzenegger flick. I can't go into detail without some major spoilers, but the simple fact of the matter is that the human body can only withstand so much punishment before it simply gives out; Craven's original script understood this well, while Aja and Levasseur's throws all believability-- something, ironically, they had worked far more painstakingly in their film than Craven did in his to preserve-- out the window. It's as if the final sixth of the film were directed by an entirely different individual, one who lacks any of the facets of directing skill that made the first five-sixths of the film well worth your time.And, of course, for gravy, you get the obligatory ""here's a shot that'll set us up for a sequel"" in the final seconds. It's almost painful to watch.Wait for the DVD, and be prepared. But the first eighty-five minutes are very well done. ** ",3,"So close, and yet so far.",1143072000,"03 23, 2006",2006,2762,"['Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'Alexandre', 'Aja', '2006', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'was', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'first', 'great', 'film', 'argument', 'be', 'made', 'still', 'best', 'work', 'question', 'why', 'directors', 'will', 'produce', 'remakes', 'own', 'films', 'almost', 'guaranteed', 'not', 'hold', 'candle', 'originals', 'Alexandre', 'Aja', 'Haute', 'Tension', 'remake', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'produced', 'Craven', 'far', 'far', 'better', 'last', 'year', 'awful', 'remake', 'Fog', 'when', 'right', 'down', 'times', 'nothing', 'still', 'nothing.The', 'plot', 'who', 'somehow', 'missed', 'original', 'modern', 'American', 'extended', 'family', 'get', 'stranded', 'desert', 'miles', 'nowhere', 'find', 'facing', 'family', 'one', 'savages', 'Cue', 'survival', 'thriller.I', 'could', 'rewrite', 'good', 'portion', 'Dark', 'Water', 'review', 'one', 'first', 'eighty-five', 'minutes', 'thereabouts', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'textbook', 'how', 'create', 'remake', 'are', 'similarities', 'Aja', 'Levasseur', 'took', 'original', 'source', 'material', 'made', 'own', 'were', 'trade-offs', 'worked', 'charm', 'did', ""n't"", 'most', 'notably', 'latter', 'camp', 'setup', 'focused', 'characterizing', 'modern', 'family', 'expense', 'characterizing', 'savage', 'family', 'general', 'looked', 'own', 'beast', 'rather', 'remake', 'was', 'holding', 'up', 'quite', 'nicely', 'one', 'parallel', 'was', ""n't"", 'working', 'was', 'Doug', 'X2', 'Aaron', 'Stanford', 'sporting', 'scary-looking', 'facial', 'hair', 'transformation', 'original', 'film', 'hippie', 'peacenik', 'violent', 'survivalist', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'bits', 'subtext', 'be', 'found', 'there', 'then', 'figured', 'were', 'planning', 'changing', 'whole', 'schlemiel', 'anyway', 'why', 'not', 'mess', 'Doug', 'Then', 'however', 'whole', 'thing', 'became', 'sudden', 'mess', 'were', 'transported', 'creepy', 'Wes', 'Craven-inspired', 'world', 'something', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'seemed', 'terribly', 'place', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'flick', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'detail', 'major', 'spoilers', 'simple', 'fact', 'matter', 'human', 'body', 'can', 'only', 'withstand', 'so', 'much', 'punishment', 'simply', 'out', 'Craven', 'original', 'script', 'understood', 'well', 'Aja', 'Levasseur', 'throws', 'believability', 'something', 'ironically', 'had', 'worked', 'far', 'more', 'painstakingly', 'film', 'Craven', 'did', 'preserve', 'window', 'final', 'sixth', 'film', 'were', 'directed', 'entirely', 'different', 'individual', 'one', 'who', 'facets', 'directing', 'skill', 'made', 'first', 'five-sixths', 'film', 'well', 'time.And', 'course', 'gravy', 'get', 'obligatory', 'here', 'shot', ""'ll"", 'set', 'up', 'sequel', 'final', 'seconds', 'almost', 'painful', 'watch.Wait', 'DVD', 'be', 'prepared', 'first', 'eighty-five', 'minutes', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', '**']",The Hills Have Eyes

The movie revolves around a typical American family traveling cross-country in there RV. The family includes Big Bob-The Patriarch of the clan, Doting wife Ethel, Oldest daughter Lynn along with her husband Doug and there infant daughter Catherine, teenagers Brenda and Bobby Jr and the family dogs Beauty And Beast. The suspense begins when a gas station attendant who is bizarrly entangled in a sort of exchange system with our antagonists, sends our lovely family on a dead end straight to mutant-ville USA. When the terror really begins viewers will not only be shocked and appalled but will also feel slightly violated. The Hills Have Eyes is a no-holds-barred, thrill ride. I have never seen the original film, but I cannot imagine how graphic it could have been compared to this gore-fest. Along with one of the family dogs getting gutted, viewers will bare witness to the family bird's head bitten off while the other one is stomped into it's cage, someone burned alive at the stake, a brutal rape scene, a gun pointed at a baby's head, fingers chopped off, a throat ripped out, a head blown off, and other excruciatingly disturbing scenes. This movie is definetly not for the squeamish. I would say this movie was as shocking, if not more shocking than Hostel-which, before I had scene The Hills Have Eyes, had been the most graphic movie I had ever seen.

987027,A3DC53MM1NGLBB,B000FAOC2M,Sean,"[0, 0]","Another remake. We've seen so many of them recently and have been disappointed by most of them. Only a few, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Dawn of The Dead, have been good. No surprise here though that we have another one. This time it's Wes Craven's The Hills Have Eyes.This film is written and directed by Alexandre Aja (Haute Tension). This film follows the Carters, an idyllic American family traveling through the great American southwest. But their trip takes a detour into an area closed off from the public, but more importantly from society. An area originally used by the U.S. Government for nuclear testing that was intended to be empty...or so they thought? When the Carter's car breaks down at the old site, they're stranded...or are they? As the Carters may soon realize that what seemed like a car casually breaking down, might actually be a trap. This trap might be perpetrated by the inhabitants of the site who aren't pulling a prank, but are out to set up a gruesome massacre.I have never seen the original so I have nothing to compare this to; I am only going to review this movie on its own merits. I flat out loved this movie. It was so visceral and intense that no movie I've seen recently can touch it. Hostel was flat out violent and gruesome. This was something totally different. I have never been so exhausted after seeing a movie. When I walked out of the theater I had the biggest smile on my face.I actually cared (a lot) about the characters. That's why this movie takes a while to get going, you get to know and care for the characters and when three of them died in the absolutely awesome trailer sequence [you'll know it] I was sad. **SPOILER**When the one guy was going to shoot Brenda and then you see the blood on the trailer window, I thought Bobby had shot the guy but when I saw that Brenda was shot, I was like ""HUH?"" and I felt bad.**END SPOILER** You care about the characters in this movie and it pays off big time. This movie is also very violent. Not sickening in your face violent like Hostel was, just plain awesome and disturbing violence. There's a ton of blood but it doesn't feel overused or ridiculous at any point in the movie. This is one intense movie. Whoa is all I have to say about it. Once it starts it never lets up, not even at the end. There's just so much to talk about with this movie but I'm not going to here, you all just need to see it. This is a breath of fresh air in this genre. Aja gives horror the kick in the ass it so desperately needed. This is how horror should be; an unrelenting, unforgiving thrill ride with huge balls. Thank you Alexandre Aja. I can't wait for you're next movie. Oh and this also is the definition of a theater experience. Instead of most movies where you have the sound blasting out of speakers this actually makes use of the surround sound. You'll hear crows or screams or noises that are off screen to your left or right. One time I actually thought somebody brought a baby in with them only to find out it was in the movie. This is an awesome awesome thing to witness. It truly breaks the fourth wall. Another interesting thing which I don't know if it was intentional or not but one time when one character shone a flashlight beam towards the audience the light from it made the light from the projector visible so it looked like the was shining the light right at us. Again, intentional or not, it was awesome! The music was pretty good, I didn't notice the score but maybe that was intentional like in Haute Tension. The makeup was pretty good, if a bit unoriginal at times, one guy looked exactly like Jason from F13 Part 2 minus the hair. I mean EXACTLY. At the end this also sets up for a sequel. I hope there is not one cause I like the thought of it ending right there. And even though it sets up for a sequel, it does so in an absolutely awesome way. I loved the last shot of this movie.So I didn't touch on all the points I wanted to but as I'm sitting here writing this I realized I didn't need to, all I should do is give my basic thoughts and let people experience this for themselves. Alexandre Aja is the next big horror director/master and I for one will be in line eagerly awaiting his next picture. This was a horror movie and everyone should see it.

987035,A3KKM0T1KY42HA,B000FAOC2M,Sky,"[0, 0]","Pretty much exactly what you'd expect. A couple of surprises.I never saw the original (1977), so you'll get no comparisons here. And when the original director (Wes Craven) has oversight to the re-make and is involved in the re-write, that pretty much obviates the need for seeing the original. In fact, word is that Craven pursued Director Alexandre Aja to direct The Hills remake after seeing Aja's 2005 psychological horror film High Tension (another fair-at-best attempt; see my 11/7/2005 full High Tension review).Most of Hills is predictable: a family of travelers take a regrettable short cut in the dessert. They are ultimately hunted down and murdered one by one by a band of psychos. Going into the film my expectations were set for a gore fest, but that's where one of the surprises was. It was not really a movie made to see how it could one-up itself on one torturous, gory death after another. Oh, the deaths weren't pretty...make no mistake. But they mostly weren't drawn out. The nut-cases mostly just kill their victims...not torture them.The other surprise was that it wasn't a bad film for its genre. The story, while predictable, flowed well. The acting was decent. And it kept you watching. The characters do a lot of stuff that they shouldn't do. You know...""don't go in there,"" ""don't set down that weapon,"" ""why is the group splitting up"" and all that. But overall you keep watching.The movie made its budget back in spades, so what do I know? Hence, a good reason Craven has commissioned a 2007 remake (sans Aja) of the sequel (1985) to the remake of the original (got all that?). I guess there must be ""a bigger appetite"" for this kind of entertainment than I would have predicted.Collect horror? Go ahead then, add this to your library.

Family takes road trip - dad takes shortcut - car dies (or is killed) - family members get disemboweled.

987037,A2VUOO5RVB78A7,B000FAOC2M,Stephanie Sandlin,"[0, 0]","The Hills Have Eyes.**** 1/2Unaware until tonight this was a remake. I dove in with a doubt in mind that this would be a worthy way to spend 1:48. It was time well spent and I'm glad I picked this up. The film's dark atmosphere, brutality, realism and direction are all well done.This is what I call the ""maim"" genre. It has had many entrants over the last few years - Hostel and Saw are examples. This film with its excellent special effects and opening story surpass both of those in my opinion. (Especially Hostel - no college kids trolling for sex in this film thank goodness)The story is fairly simple. Family takes dubious short cut and becomes fodder for mutant psychopaths. The first 30 minutes of the film is the set up. We know whats going to happen to the Carters. The producers know this. They know we'll stick around to find how and by who. The teases at the gas station are well done to play on your sense of all is not well and someone is watching.Once the Carters start getting it is where the film shines. The tension draws you in. Many movies don't pull you well these days. This does. You can relate to these people being stuck in the middle of nowhere. We've all had a car breakdown so we've been there.The violence is top notch. I'm normally not very queasy. However, the rape scene had me squirming. Axes in skulls, no sweat. An adult mutant breastfeeding while having the gun to the young mothers head. Just disturbing.An element as I've been writing this review has been making me think. I really liked the mutant teenage girl. We never got to know her, but we sensed she had good in her. In the end that sense was confirmed. In the sea of horrific acts, malicious calculated murders and mutilation - human good still existed in the worst of places. Having her character in the film for me, as a viewer made the film much better.The fact too that she didn't speak was a well done touch. It left her to speak with her eyes. It kept it very subtle and pure without clouding her character up.The final seconds of the film somewhat annoyed me. No real resolution. It was people hugging - ""lets get out of here"" in the middle of nowhere with a strong hint another mutant was still watching. I find the often used closer that suggests the survivors plight may not be over to be well, borderline cliche.An ending that would've been more fullfilling would've been them being rescued. Then - the zoom out as seen through binoculars. They could've used that as a great springboard in the sequel.Overall for that annoyance at the end I give it 4 1/2 stars. It's very effective on a primal level. It pulls you in nicely. The special effects are top notch. Only complaint I have is the end -  too incomplete.If you're a horror fan - watch this.

O'Blenis,"[3, 3]","Rarely, even in horror movies, has a road trip gone wrong turned into such a nightmarish excursion to Hell as in the outstanding remake of ""The Hills Have Eyes"".  Not for the squeamish, this prime example of extreme horror at times even hits the harrowing level of ""The House Of 1,000 Corpses"".A family is crossing the country in a large motor-home in what is already a somewhat uncomfortable trip because of tensions between some of its members, but it's nothing any of them would have predicted would have been among life's worst experiences.  The shortcut across the desert (quite a grand and beautiful desert, by the way) takes them through a long barren stretch unpopluated by human beings, where it would be a major difficulty to run into vehicle trouble miles and miles away from the nearest gas station.  Well, it's Supposed to be unpopulated by humans, anyway.  The same was true, though, of that desert decades ago, when early atomic bombs were regularly tested there.  There are few places on Earth one could go where the indigineous life is less welcoming, and before the unfortunate family even has a chance to think about fighting back, ruthless horror is about to land a devastating series of first strikes.Hard to watch in places (but in a good way), this is flinch-and-cringe-inducing like ""Audition"" and the scariest ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" installments.  It's also strikingly well-made, with excellent performances, high-caliber production values, and terrifically realistic effects.  Among the year's best movies, but one that'll be just too visceral and disturbing for most non-horror fans, understandably.  For those who don't mind intense shocks and extraordinarily high doses of fictional mayhem at its most harrowing, though, it's brilliant and not-to-be-missed.",5,A Riveting Horror Ride Of Carnage; Really Disturbing And Fearsome,1161734400,"10 25, 2006",2006,1789,"['Rarely', 'even', 'horror', 'movies', 'road', 'trip', 'gone', 'wrong', 'turned', 'such', 'nightmarish', 'excursion', 'Hell', 'outstanding', 'remake', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'Not', 'squeamish', 'prime', 'example', 'extreme', 'horror', 'times', 'even', 'harrowing', 'level', 'House', '1,000', 'Corpses', '.A', 'family', 'crossing', 'country', 'large', 'motor-home', 'what', 'already', 'somewhat', 'uncomfortable', 'trip', 'tensions', 'members', 'nothing', 'would', 'have', 'predicted', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'life', 'worst', 'experiences', 'shortcut', 'desert', 'quite', 'grand', 'beautiful', 'desert', 'way', 'long', 'barren', 'stretch', 'unpopluated', 'human', 'beings', 'where', 'would', 'be', 'major', 'difficulty', 'run', 'vehicle', 'trouble', 'miles', 'miles', 'away', 'nearest', 'gas', 'station', 'Well', 'Supposed', 'be', 'unpopulated', 'humans', 'anyway', 'same', 'was', 'true', 'though', 'desert', 'decades', 'ago', 'when', 'early', 'atomic', 'bombs', 'were', 'regularly', 'tested', 'there', 'are', 'few', 'places', 'Earth', 'one', 'could', 'go', 'where', 'indigineous', 'life', 'less', 'welcoming', 'unfortunate', 'family', 'even', 'chance', 'think', 'fighting', 'back', 'ruthless', 'horror', 'land', 'devastating', 'series', 'first', 'strikes.Hard', 'watch', 'places', 'good', 'way', 'flinch-and-cringe-inducing', 'Audition', 'scariest', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'installments', 'also', 'strikingly', 'well-made', 'excellent', 'performances', 'high-caliber', 'production', 'values', 'terrifically', 'realistic', 'effects', 'year', 'best', 'movies', 'one', ""'ll"", 'be', 'just', 'too', 'visceral', 'disturbing', 'most', 'non-horror', 'fans', 'understandably', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'intense', 'shocks', 'extraordinarily', 'high', 'doses', 'fictional', 'mayhem', 'most', 'harrowing', 'though', 'brilliant', 'not-to-be-missed']",The Hills Have Eyes

Basically following a faimly a family as they go across country towards  California. While crossing some desert terrain they stumble into an area that was once used by the government for nuclear testing. the faimly takes the wrong turn detour and end up stranded in the middle of nowhere,where there's no one except themselves to seek aid from. In an attempt to find help, two men from the group split up in opposite directions, hoping to come across someone,It doesn't take long before the mutated desert people come to cause trouble,raping and mudering their way into the faimly trailer,essentially leaving the faimly to fend for themselves and forcing the least likely of heroes to spawn from this carnage. I really liked this movie. It had tense scenes, a good mix of violence and gore, and the pacing never once seemed to slow down. Unlike in the original, where it slowed down in parts, and it definitely was'nt as gory as this one. It's rarethat a remake surpasses it's predecessor, but it does happen,and in this case it did, thanks to Alexandre Aja's twisted mind. I'm looking forward to see what else this director has in stored for the genre. Overall This is a great movie. There a nice blend of gore, violence to please any horror fan.

987045,A268EEWUXYCA8Q,B000FAOC2M,Terry Mesnard,"[6, 7]","Recently Hollywood has created a trend of remaking horror movies from ages past.  Sometimes, these remakes are warranted and good.  Other times (Fog, When a Strange Calls), the remakes are just stupid attempts at helping an ailing movie industry.  The Hills Have Eyes comes onto this scene as a completely enthralling and entertaining remake that keeps the feeling of the original, but injects it with much much more.The writing and directing team this time around (Alexandre Aja and Gr&eacute;gory Levasseur) comes from those who gave us last years High Tension.  Always a good indication that this could be a warranted remake, the original director (Wes Craven in this case) sought out Aja asked him to take a look at the film and see what he could do with it.  Wes eventually signed off on the changes and allowed Aja room to make it his own.What Aja does to this film is he re-imagines it.  It follows the similar plot structure of the original, with a few changes.  It stands on its own, but also keeps the feeling of the original one.  The changes made were for the best, in my opinion.  And with a much stronger cast (with no short shorts-wearing teenaged boy) the drama is better and the characters are more realistic.Like Aja's previous film, High Tension, The Hills Have Eyes is, at times, incredibly intense.  Everything plays out in front of you in grisly and uncomfortable real time.  Almost nothing is hidden from the viewers.  It is at times, squirm-inducing, placing this film squarely in line with other gore films of the last year, including Hostel.Hills...follows basically the same plot structure as the original, just updated and with other story additions added in.  Mostly, the story changes work in favor of the movie and make some of the situations more ""realistic.""  For instance, in the original, the characters set one of the dead bodies in a chair in order to surprise, rope and use their car to kill one of the bad guys.  Not the most realistic approach.  Its no longer here.When the revenge portion of the films comes Alexandre Aja actually makes them actually work for it.  By the end of the film, the surviving characters have gone through hell.  And, unlike some horror films, they truly have to work to survive.  There were times where I didn't know how one of them was going to make it.  Very excellent, edge of your seat tense.One truly sore spot is in the use of music.  High Tension's music was so uniquely used to mimic the tension and feeling of the scenes and I was hoping Aja would use a similar approach.  Instead, we have the traditional American horror film sound.  When shadows move across the screen, there's that ""whooom"" sound.  Sometimes, the music arches up to melodramatic, eye-rolling HERO MUSIC!  At other times, its more effective as with the crunching guitars that set up what happens when the family first meets the mutants.  Its a mishmash of good and bad; unfortunately, the bad tends to over-rule.  I just wish the music was more in line with what Aja did on High Tension.Another thing I had fault with was how perfectly some sequences worked out.  For instance, the finale with the explosion.  Sure, it was in the original.  But, in the original it felt spontaneous and worked.  Here, it felt as if it had to be plotted that way and lacked any sense of originality.  It felt put in simply because it was in the original.  Like-wise, the first encounter with the people in the hills played out agonizingly slow and with all the noise going on, one has to wonder why no one caught on that something bad was happening in the trailer earlier.  However, the changes that were made more than make up for any of these faults and helps propel this to the forefront of remakes.  Hollywood take note: this is the way to remake a movie.Overall, though, The Hills Have Eyes is a good remake.  I have immense respect for Aja and this film simply increases that ten fold.

987051,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B000FAOC2M,trebe,"[0, 0]","The remake of Wes Craven's classic, The Hills Have Eyes (2006), follows a familiar formula, where a family is attacked by a group of cannibalistic genetic freaks, while travelling through the rocky, arid, landscapes of New Mexico.  Heading the production is the team responsible for High Tension (2003), and Mirrors (2008), French director/writer Alexandre Aja (Mirrors), and writer Gregory Levasseur.  Wes Craven, serves as a co-producer for the project.In an SUV towing a mobile home, the Carter family is California bound, when they stop to refuel at a rundown gas station.  Taking a tip from the station owner, the group takes a short cut, and end up crashing their vehicle in the middle of nowhere.  Head of the family Big Bob (Ted Levine), an ex-cop (and bad driver), heads off to the service station for help, while prissy son-in-law  Doug (Aaron Staford), heads up the road to look for help.  Doug finds a crater, with abandoned cars scattered around, but no way out.  As darkness falls, bad things begin to happen.The Carter family's reactions seem pretty normal, and they are extremely inept throughout.  Panic can prevent the mind from thinking clearly, and that seems to be the case here, as almost everything they do is a disaster.  Big Bob, the experienced cop, shoots wildly at nothing, and ends up attending a barbecue.  Big Bob leaves teenage son Bobby (Dan Byrd), with a gun, but the situation is too much for him to deal with, he can't shoot straight, and just makes blunder after blunder.  Unfortunately the women (Kathleen Quinlan, Vinessa Shaw, and Emilie de Ravin) do not fare well at all, at the hands of the freaks.  Doug is resolved to take action, when his baby daughter Catherine is kidnapped.  The family dogs, Beauty and Beast, are always breaking loose, but fortunately Beast is the first one in the Carter clan prepared to kill, to defend the family.The genetic mutants, products of exposure to radioactivity, are quite grotesque, and unique looking monsters (Big Brain, Lizard, Papa Jupiter and Goggle).  Fortunately, they are not very bright.  The buildup takes a while, but Hills delivers some powerful shocks and gore, with some memorable axe wielding violence, bird blood sipping, human torch action, and threatening of an infant at gunpoint.The DVD has some nice extras including 'Surviving the Hills', a 50 minute making of documentary, production diaries, and two commentary tracks.  One by Aja, Levasseur, and producer Marianne Maddalena, mainly focuses on the production of the film, while the second commentary by producers Wes Craven and Peter Locke, is humorously all over the place, between the original 1977 film, and the remake.Filmed in various locations including Morocco, the finished version of film fits together pretty well, and features some cool cinematography.  The complete ineptness of the Carter family makes it makes it hard to get on their side at first, but things do turn around, as Doug and Beast take the fight to the mutants.  The hard hitting remake of The Hills Have Eyes, is recommended to fans of the original, as well as to gorehounds in general.",4,from California Dreamin' . . . to New Mexico nightmare!,1259971200,"12 5, 2009",2009,3118,"['remake', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'classic', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', '2006', 'familiar', 'formula', 'where', 'family', 'attacked', 'group', 'cannibalistic', 'genetic', 'freaks', 'travelling', 'rocky', 'arid', 'landscapes', 'New', 'Mexico', 'Heading', 'production', 'team', 'responsible', 'High', 'Tension', '2003', 'Mirrors', '2008', 'French', 'director/writer', 'Alexandre', 'Aja', 'Mirrors', 'writer', 'Gregory', 'Levasseur', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'co-producer', 'project.In', 'SUV', 'towing', 'mobile', 'home', 'Carter', 'family', 'California', 'bound', 'when', 'stop', 'refuel', 'rundown', 'gas', 'station', 'Taking', 'tip', 'station', 'owner', 'group', 'short', 'cut', 'end', 'up', 'crashing', 'vehicle', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'Head', 'family', 'Big', 'Bob', 'Ted', 'Levine', 'ex-cop', 'bad', 'driver', 'service', 'station', 'help', 'prissy', 'son-in-law', 'Doug', 'Aaron', 'Staford', 'up', 'road', 'look', 'help', 'Doug', 'crater', 'abandoned', 'cars', 'scattered', 'around', 'way', 'out', 'darkness', 'bad', 'things', 'begin', 'happen.The', 'Carter', 'family', 'reactions', 'seem', 'pretty', 'normal', 'are', 'extremely', 'inept', 'Panic', 'can', 'prevent', 'mind', 'thinking', 'clearly', 'be', 'case', 'here', 'almost', 'everything', 'do', 'disaster', 'Big', 'Bob', 'experienced', 'cop', 'shoots', 'wildly', 'nothing', 'up', 'attending', 'barbecue', 'Big', 'Bob', 'teenage', 'son', 'Bobby', 'Dan', 'Byrd', 'gun', 'situation', 'too', 'much', 'deal', 'ca', ""n't"", 'shoot', 'straight', 'just', 'blunder', 'blunder', 'Unfortunately', 'women', 'Kathleen', 'Quinlan', 'Vinessa', 'Shaw', 'Emilie', 'de', 'Ravin', 'do', 'not', 'fare', 'well', 'hands', 'freaks', 'Doug', 'resolved', 'take', 'action', 'when', 'baby', 'daughter', 'Catherine', 'kidnapped', 'family', 'dogs', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'are', 'always', 'breaking', 'loose', 'fortunately', 'Beast', 'first', 'one', 'Carter', 'clan', 'prepared', 'kill', 'defend', 'family.The', 'genetic', 'mutants', 'products', 'exposure', 'radioactivity', 'are', 'quite', 'grotesque', 'unique', 'looking', 'monsters', 'Big', 'Brain', 'Lizard', 'Papa', 'Jupiter', 'Goggle', 'Fortunately', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'bright', 'buildup', 'while', 'Hills', 'powerful', 'shocks', 'gore', 'memorable', 'axe', 'wielding', 'violence', 'bird', 'blood', 'sipping', 'human', 'torch', 'action', 'threatening', 'infant', 'gunpoint.The', 'DVD', 'nice', 'extras', 'including', ""'Surviving"", 'Hills', '50', 'minute', 'making', 'documentary', 'production', 'diaries', 'two', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'One', 'Aja', 'Levasseur', 'producer', 'Marianne', 'Maddalena', 'mainly', 'production', 'film', 'second', 'commentary', 'producers', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'Peter', 'Locke', 'humorously', 'place', 'original', '1977', 'film', 'remake.Filmed', 'various', 'locations', 'including', 'Morocco', 'finished', 'version', 'film', 'fits', 'together', 'pretty', 'well', 'cool', 'cinematography', 'complete', 'ineptness', 'Carter', 'family', 'hard', 'get', 'side', 'first', 'things', 'do', 'turn', 'around', 'Doug', 'Beast', 'take', 'fight', 'mutants', 'hard', 'hitting', 'remake', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'recommended', 'fans', 'original', 'as', 'well', 'gorehounds', 'general']",The Hills Have Eyes

The fact that the film-makers could find the perfect medium for the movie, and also maintain the awesome scenery and character development has thoroughly impressed me as a horror lover.Well, there's not much else to say here, other than this movie rocks! If you want a great horror movie, and one of the far better remakes of the last ten years, ""The Hills Have Eyes"" will have you glued to your couch!

The acting was very good, and the story chugged along keeping me interested. I also enjoyed the ending.While not the best horror film I have seen this year, The Hills Have Eyes is a movie I will remember having watched. Some may not like it because it isn't a typical horror flick, but I got my movie's worth.Also, some reviewers have criticized the Hills Have Eyes for a brutal rape scene, calling it ""Porno Violence"". This is merely yelling fire in a crowded theater. The ""rape"" scene gave us nothing but a blurred camera and implied action. It was neither brutal nor particularly horrid. In fact, I think the director handled it very appropriately. There was nothing to be shocked about. And as far as violence goes, the Hills Have Eyes is far from being Hostel.Total Score (out of 100) = 5524 (out of 50). Enjoyment. A rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film.8 (out of 10).

Written by filmmaking partners Alexandre Aja and Gr&eacute;gory Levasseur of the French horror film Haute Tension, and directed by Aja, the film follows a family who becomes the target of a group of murderous mutants after their car breaks down in the desert.The film was released theatrically in the United States and United Kingdom on March 10, 2006. It earned $15.5 million in its opening weekend in the U.S.,[1] where it was originally rated NC-17 for strong gruesome violence, but was later edited down to an R-rating. An unrated DVD version was released on June 20, 2006. A sequel, The Hills Have Eyes 2, was released in theaters March 23, 2007.Ethel Carter (Kathleen Quinlan) and her husband, Bob Carter (Ted Levine) are traveling from Cleveland, Ohio to San Diego, California. Along with them is their daughter Brenda (Emilie de Ravin), son Bobby (Dan Byrd), eldest daughter Lynn (Vinessa Shaw), her husband Doug Bukowski (Aaron Stanford), their baby Catherine (Maisie Camilleri Preziosi), and the German Shepherds, Beauty and Beast.After driving a few miles, the tires are punctured by a hidden spike belt. Bob returns to the gas station for a tow truck. Beauty runs into the hills and Bobby chases after her, eventually finding her corpse. Frightened, he runs, slips and falls, going unconscious. A young female mutant named Ruby (Laura Ortiz) comes across him and is intrigued, while her brother Goggle (Ezra Buzzington) chews over the dead dog. When Bob reaches the station, he finds the hysterical attendant (Tom Bower), who ultimately commits suicide. In fear, Bob tries to flee but gets attacked by the mutant leader, Papa Jupiter (Billy Drago). He is carried off into the mining caves by Jupiter, along with Jupiter's eldest son, Lizard (Robert Joy), and Pluto.When Bobby awakes, he returns and does not tell his family of Beauty. As the family tries to sleep, Pluto sneaks into the trailer and attempts to rape Brenda. The others discover that Bob has been tied to a tree and set on fire. Doug unties Bob, but he is already dead by then. Lizard slips inside the trailer, throws Pluto off, and rapes Brenda himself. Lynn returns to the trailer and is greeted by Lizard and Pluto, who are holding Catherine and Brenda. Lizard forces open Lynn's blouse and sucks her breasts. Ethel attempts to pulverize Lizard but he shoots her and Lynn as well. The gun is out of bullets before Lizard can shoot Brenda, and he and Pluto flee with Catherine.Doug and Bobby return to the trailer and discover the bodies. The next morning, Doug goes off in pursuit of their attackers. He finds an abandoned nuclear testing village and enters the house where Catherine is kept. He is knocked unconscious by Big Mama (Ivana Turchetto), and awakes in an icebox filled with human body parts. He frees himself and tries to find Catherine, only to encounter Big Brain (Desmond Askew). Big Brain tells him the story of the mutants, who were mutated by the fallout from the nuclear tests. Doug is then attacked by Pluto and loses two fingers in the ensuing struggle. He momentarily distracts Pluto and then kills him with the blade of his own axe.Doug surprises the mutant Cyst (Gregory Nicotero) outside and uses Pluto's axe to kill him, while Big Brain is ultimately killed by Beast. Lizard takes a cleaver and prepares to kill Catherine, but finds that instead of Catherine, it is a pig. Ruby has taken Catherine and run into the hills; Lizard chases her, enraged by her deceit. Doug starts chasing Ruby as well. At the trailer, Ethel's body is dragged into the hills, and Bobby finds Papa Jupiter eating Ethel's heart. Jupiter pursues Bobby to the trailer, where Brenda releases gas from the propane tanks. Bobby binds Papa Jupiter's hand to the window and he and Brenda escape. The trailer then expolodes.In the hills, Ruby is about to return Catherine to Doug when Lizard attacks. Doug shoots Lizard three times. Ruby gives Catherine back to Doug, who does not notice Lizard stand up, having survived. Ruby throws herself at Lizard, plunging them over a cliff, to stop Lizard from shooting Doug and Catherine, and sacrificing herself in the process. Bobby and Brenda walk through the ruins of the trailer and find Papa Jupiter still alive, though impaled. Brenda kills Papa Jupiter with a pickaxe and then spots Doug with Catherine and Beast. The four are reunited. As they celebrate their apparent victory, a pair of anonymous binoculars watches from the hills.If You Mutans your gonna like this !",5,People = Mutan Food = Ax = Killing !,1326931200,"01 19, 2012",2012,4592,"['Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', '2006', 'horror', 'film', 'remake', 'Wes', 'Craven', '1977', 'film', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'Written', 'filmmaking', 'partners', 'Alexandre', 'Aja', 'Gr', 'eacute', 'gory', 'Levasseur', 'French', 'horror', 'film', 'Haute', 'Tension', 'directed', 'Aja', 'film', 'family', 'who', 'target', 'group', 'murderous', 'mutants', 'car', 'breaks', 'down', 'desert.The', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'theatrically', 'United', 'States', 'United', 'Kingdom', 'March', '10', '2006', 'earned', '15.5', 'million', 'opening', 'weekend', 'U.S.', '1', ']', 'where', 'was', 'originally', 'rated', 'NC-17', 'strong', 'gruesome', 'violence', 'was', 'later', 'edited', 'down', 'R-rating', 'unrated', 'DVD', 'version', 'was', 'released', 'June', '20', '2006', 'sequel', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', '2', 'was', 'released', 'theaters', 'March', '23', '2007.Ethel', 'Carter', 'Kathleen', 'Quinlan', 'husband', 'Bob', 'Carter', 'Ted', 'Levine', 'are', 'traveling', 'Cleveland', 'Ohio', 'San', 'Diego', 'California', 'daughter', 'Brenda', 'Emilie', 'de', 'Ravin', 'son', 'Bobby', 'Dan', 'Byrd', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'Lynn', 'Vinessa', 'Shaw', 'husband', 'Doug', 'Bukowski', 'Aaron', 'Stanford', 'baby', 'Catherine', 'Maisie', 'Camilleri', 'Preziosi', 'German', 'Shepherds', 'Beauty', 'Beast.After', 'driving', 'few', 'miles', 'tires', 'are', 'punctured', 'hidden', 'spike', 'belt', 'Bob', 'gas', 'station', 'tow', 'truck', 'Beauty', 'hills', 'Bobby', 'chases', 'eventually', 'finding', 'corpse', 'Frightened', 'slips', 'falls', 'going', 'unconscious', 'young', 'female', 'mutant', 'named', 'Ruby', 'Laura', 'Ortiz', 'intrigued', 'brother', 'Goggle', 'Ezra', 'Buzzington', 'dead', 'dog', 'When', 'Bob', 'station', 'hysterical', 'attendant', 'Tom', 'Bower', 'who', 'ultimately', 'suicide', 'fear', 'Bob', 'flee', 'attacked', 'mutant', 'leader', 'Papa', 'Jupiter', 'Billy', 'Drago', 'carried', 'mining', 'caves', 'Jupiter', 'Jupiter', 'eldest', 'son', 'Lizard', 'Robert', 'Joy', 'Pluto.When', 'Bobby', 'awakes', 'not', 'tell', 'family', 'Beauty', 'family', 'sleep', 'Pluto', 'trailer', 'attempts', 'rape', 'Brenda', 'others', 'discover', 'Bob', 'been', 'tied', 'tree', 'set', 'fire', 'Doug', 'unties', 'Bob', 'already', 'dead', 'then', 'Lizard', 'trailer', 'Pluto', 'off', 'Brenda', 'Lynn', 'trailer', 'greeted', 'Lizard', 'Pluto', 'who', 'are', 'holding', 'Catherine', 'Brenda', 'Lizard', 'forces', 'open', 'Lynn', 'blouse', 'breasts', 'Ethel', 'pulverize', 'Lizard', 'Lynn', 'as', 'well', 'gun', 'bullets', 'Lizard', 'can', 'shoot', 'Brenda', 'Pluto', 'flee', 'Catherine.Doug', 'Bobby', 'return', 'trailer', 'discover', 'bodies', 'next', 'morning', 'Doug', 'off', 'pursuit', 'attackers', 'abandoned', 'nuclear', 'testing', 'village', 'house', 'where', 'Catherine', 'kept', 'knocked', 'unconscious', 'Big', 'Mama', 'Ivana', 'Turchetto', 'awakes', 'icebox', 'filled', 'human', 'body', 'parts', 'tries', 'find', 'Catherine', 'only', 'encounter', 'Big', 'Brain', 'Desmond', 'Askew', 'Big', 'Brain', 'story', 'mutants', 'who', 'were', 'mutated', 'fallout', 'nuclear', 'tests', 'Doug', 'then', 'attacked', 'Pluto', 'two', 'fingers', 'ensuing', 'struggle', 'momentarily', 'Pluto', 'then', 'blade', 'own', 'axe.Doug', 'mutant', 'Cyst', 'Gregory', 'Nicotero', 'outside', 'Pluto', 'axe', 'kill', 'Big', 'Brain', 'ultimately', 'killed', 'Beast', 'Lizard', 'cleaver', 'prepares', 'kill', 'Catherine', 'instead', 'Catherine', 'pig', 'Ruby', 'taken', 'Catherine', 'run', 'hills', 'Lizard', 'enraged', 'deceit', 'Doug', 'chasing', 'Ruby', 'as', 'well', 'trailer', 'Ethel', 'body', 'dragged', 'hills', 'Bobby', 'Papa', 'Jupiter', 'eating', 'Ethel', 'heart', 'Jupiter', 'Bobby', 'trailer', 'where', 'Brenda', 'gas', 'propane', 'tanks', 'Bobby', 'Papa', 'Jupiter', 'hand', 'window', 'Brenda', 'escape', 'trailer', 'then', 'hills', 'Ruby', 'return', 'Catherine', 'Doug', 'when', 'Lizard', 'Doug', 'shoots', 'Lizard', 'three', 'times', 'Ruby', 'Catherine', 'back', 'Doug', 'who', 'not', 'notice', 'Lizard', 'stand', 'up', 'having', 'survived', 'Ruby', 'Lizard', 'plunging', 'cliff', 'stop', 'Lizard', 'shooting', 'Doug', 'Catherine', 'sacrificing', 'process', 'Bobby', 'Brenda', 'walk', 'ruins', 'trailer', 'find', 'Papa', 'Jupiter', 'still', 'alive', 'though', 'impaled', 'Brenda', 'Papa', 'Jupiter', 'pickaxe', 'then', 'spots', 'Doug', 'Catherine', 'Beast', 'four', 'are', 'reunited', 'celebrate', 'apparent', 'victory', 'pair', 'anonymous', 'binoculars', 'watches', 'hills.If', 'Mutans', 'gon']",The Hills Have Eyes

Since then it has acquired a cult film status and has been a regular must see throughout the years in the horror section of Video Rental Stores. I was really curious to see what director Alexandre Aja would do with his remake. The net result is that he stays very close to the original in terms of plot but adds on more detail and background, to the point that the result seems more of a rebuild than a remake. I wonder if Wes Craven in his involvement in this remake actually had some input into the film itself. I say that because this film is so good that it could almost be the original director, revisiting his film and adding to it. However, don't let that observation detract from Aja's work as the director because believe me, he has made a superb horror film here.As I have mentioned before, it stays very closely with the plot and sequences of the original film. The cast get well stuck into their roles, and some of them look eerily like the same characters in the original film too.Aja gives the film a sun bleached look and brings the harshness of the desert environment to life superbly. At times the rocks themselves seem to emanate heat. The plight of the Carter family in this harsh environment is starkly realised, as is the terrifying nature of their assailants - the irradiated mutants.The remake is even gorier than the original, and at times the pace of this film is breathtaking and relentless. Aja, however, gives us more detail than the original into the background of the mutants, and how they came to be the way that they are.He also shows us that the horror genre can make serious social comment. The test dummies that are found throughout the houses of the mutants, can also be interpreted as the attitude of the then US Government towards its citizens at the time of nuclear testing....The audience I saw the film with in the cinema were utterly engrossed in it from start to finish. For the most part they were completely silent, except when screaming and jumping at certain sequences. When leaving the cinema after the film had ended they were all talking among themselves about how good it was.I was amazed at how good it was and the dvd will definitely be joining my collection.If you have not yet seen this film then prepare to be chilled.",5,Prepare To Be Chilled,1151280000,"06 26, 2006",2006,2372,"['can', 'remember', 'seeing', 'original', 'Hills', 'have', 'Eyes', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'cinema', 'release', 'then', 'acquired', 'cult', 'film', 'status', 'been', 'regular', 'must', 'see', 'years', 'horror', 'section', 'Video', 'Rental', 'Stores', 'was', 'really', 'curious', 'see', 'what', 'director', 'Alexandre', 'Aja', 'would', 'do', 'remake', 'net', 'result', 'very', 'close', 'original', 'terms', 'plot', 'more', 'detail', 'background', 'point', 'result', 'more', 'rebuild', 'remake', 'wonder', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'involvement', 'remake', 'actually', 'had', 'input', 'film', 'say', 'film', 'so', 'good', 'could', 'almost', 'be', 'original', 'director', 'revisiting', 'film', 'adding', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'observation', 'detract', 'Aja', 'work', 'director', 'believe', 'made', 'superb', 'horror', 'film', 'here.As', 'have', 'mentioned', 'very', 'closely', 'plot', 'sequences', 'original', 'film', 'cast', 'get', 'well', 'stuck', 'roles', 'look', 'eerily', 'same', 'characters', 'original', 'film', 'too.Aja', 'film', 'sun', 'bleached', 'look', 'harshness', 'desert', 'environment', 'life', 'superbly', 'times', 'rocks', 'seem', 'emanate', 'heat', 'plight', 'Carter', 'family', 'harsh', 'environment', 'starkly', 'realised', 'terrifying', 'nature', 'assailants', 'irradiated', 'mutants.The', 'remake', 'even', 'gorier', 'original', 'times', 'pace', 'film', 'breathtaking', 'relentless', 'Aja', 'however', 'more', 'detail', 'original', 'background', 'mutants', 'how', 'came', 'be', 'way', 'are.He', 'also', 'horror', 'genre', 'can', 'make', 'serious', 'social', 'comment', 'test', 'dummies', 'are', 'found', 'houses', 'mutants', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'interpreted', 'attitude', 'then', 'US', 'Government', 'towards', 'citizens', 'time', 'nuclear', 'testing', '.The', 'audience', 'saw', 'film', 'cinema', 'were', 'utterly', 'engrossed', 'start', 'finish', 'most', 'part', 'were', 'completely', 'silent', 'when', 'screaming', 'jumping', 'certain', 'sequences', 'When', 'leaving', 'cinema', 'film', 'had', 'ended', 'were', 'talking', 'how', 'good', 'was', 'amazed', 'how', 'good', 'was', 'dvd', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'joining', 'collection.If', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'seen', 'film', 'then', 'prepare', 'be', 'chilled']",The Hills Have Eyes
