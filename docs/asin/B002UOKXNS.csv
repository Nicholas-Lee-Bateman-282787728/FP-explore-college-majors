1290190,A372HH7VU74JJL,B002UOKXNS,alley cat,"[0, 0]","(1/12/12, 4.5 stars, blu-ray) A powerful, wrenching movie that took me completely by surprise. Filmed in stark black and white, it feels at times like an impersonal newsreel archive of the terrifying violence and brutality perpetrated by the Japanese during their occupation of Nanking. The casualness of the often random terror inflicted by the Japanese is reflected in the detached stoicism/passiveness of the Japanese protagonist, who in the end finds himself unable to resolve the conflict between his military indoctrination and his empathy for the vanquished Chinese. Many of the combat scenes, although without special effects, are so well-enacted I found myself flinching involuntarily to dodge stray rounds. Eloquent and convincing cinematic corroboration of Sherman's remark that war is hell, doubly so when the invaders are racist supremacists.",4,ninth ring of hell in Nanking,1357948800,"01 12, 2013",2013,855,"['1/12/12', '4.5', 'stars', 'blu-ray', 'powerful', 'wrenching', 'movie', 'took', 'completely', 'surprise', 'Filmed', 'stark', 'black', 'white', 'times', 'impersonal', 'newsreel', 'archive', 'terrifying', 'violence', 'brutality', 'perpetrated', 'Japanese', 'occupation', 'Nanking', 'casualness', 'often', 'random', 'terror', 'inflicted', 'Japanese', 'reflected', 'detached', 'stoicism/passiveness', 'Japanese', 'protagonist', 'who', 'end', 'unable', 'resolve', 'conflict', 'military', 'indoctrination', 'empathy', 'vanquished', 'Chinese', 'Many', 'combat', 'scenes', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'so', 'well-enacted', 'found', 'flinching', 'involuntarily', 'dodge', 'stray', 'rounds', 'Eloquent', 'convincing', 'cinematic', 'corroboration', 'Sherman', 'remark', 'war', 'hell', 'doubly', 'so', 'when', 'invaders', 'are', 'racist', 'supremacists']",N/A

Nor is it a documented literary historiography.It is a motion picture portraying stories rooted in a particularly infamous historical incident.The film's not perfect--(few things of human manufacture ever are); however, all things considered, it's quite good--even definitive: it's highly unlikely there will ever be a finer film on the Nanjing Massacre.As a work of art it is highly stylized and the selection of scenes and scenarios is carefully made.It has some excellent [!] combat reconstructions and portrayals of war crimes.It has some profoundly shocking and moving scenes of psychic trauma and human suffering.It also has a couple of scenes which may strike some critics as being panderingly sentimental; however, we are quick to add that these same scenes may strike other viewers as sincerely heroic: `Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new, complex, and vital'.Many of the scenes depicted are absolutely rooted in historical fact; others are more stylized and provide a general idea of cultural and historical realities.In conclusion, there hasn't been a more intensely psychically horrifying film sinceRequiem for a Dream.In Cantonese and Japanese, with English subtitles.*Red SorghumRed SorghumThe Rape of Nanking: An Undeniable History in PhotographsThe Rape of Nanking: An Undeniable History in PhotographsThe Nanjing MassacreJapan's Imperial ConspiracyStilwell and the American Experience in China, 1911-1945*",5,Land War in Asia . . .,1309046400,"06 26, 2011",2011,2087,"['*When', 'wasteful', 'war', 'shall', 'statues', 'overturn', 'broils', 'root', 'out', 'work', 'masonry', 'Mars', 'sword', 'war', 'quick', 'fire', 'shall', 'burnThe', 'living', 'record', 'memory.', 'SonnetLV*Much', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'here', 'ultimately', 'film', 'must', 'be', 'viewed', 'so', 'just', 'few', 'brief', 'comments.As', 'been', 'noted', 'film', 'better', 'worse', 'effectually', 'ChineseSchindler', 'List.The', 'Nanjing', 'Massacre', 'no', 'more', 'Holocaust', 'horrible', 'matter', 'art', 'important', 'occurrence', 'human', 'events', 'must', 'be', 'kept', 'alive', 'living', 'memory.Here', 'form', 'are', 'considering', 'i.e.', 'cinematographic', 'art.This', 'not', 'film-documentary', 'documented', 'literary', 'historiography.It', 'motion', 'picture', 'portraying', 'stories', 'rooted', 'particularly', 'infamous', 'historical', 'incident.The', 'film', 'not', 'perfect', 'few', 'things', 'human', 'manufacture', 'ever', 'are', 'however', 'things', 'considered', 'quite', 'good', 'even', 'definitive', 'highly', 'unlikely', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'finer', 'film', 'Nanjing', 'Massacre.As', 'work', 'art', 'highly', 'stylized', 'selection', 'scenes', 'scenarios', 'carefully', 'made.It', 'excellent', '[', ']', 'combat', 'reconstructions', 'portrayals', 'war', 'crimes.It', 'profoundly', 'shocking', 'moving', 'scenes', 'psychic', 'trauma', 'human', 'suffering.It', 'also', 'couple', 'scenes', 'may', 'strike', 'critics', 'being', 'panderingly', 'sentimental', 'however', 'are', 'quick', 'add', 'same', 'scenes', 'may', 'strike', 'other', 'viewers', 'sincerely', 'heroic', 'Diversity', 'opinion', 'work', 'art', 'shows', 'work', 'new', 'complex', ""vital'.Many"", 'scenes', 'depicted', 'are', 'absolutely', 'rooted', 'historical', 'fact', 'others', 'are', 'more', 'stylized', 'provide', 'general', 'idea', 'cultural', 'historical', 'realities.In', 'conclusion', ""n't"", 'been', 'more', 'intensely', 'psychically', 'horrifying', 'film', 'sinceRequiem', 'Dream.In', 'Cantonese', 'Japanese', 'English', 'subtitles', '*Red', 'SorghumRed', 'SorghumThe', 'Rape', 'Nanking', 'Undeniable', 'History', 'PhotographsThe', 'Rape', 'Nanking', 'Undeniable', 'History', 'PhotographsThe', 'Nanjing', 'MassacreJapan', 'Imperial', 'ConspiracyStilwell', 'American', 'Experience', 'China', '1911-1945*']",N/A
1290194,A6DOCZ10B7JAJ,B002UOKXNS,"C. Christopher Blackshere ""Mackshere""","[5, 6]","What the hell is wrong with people?  This is a film that will leave you feeling numb and almost ashamed to be a human being.  Now I've seen the movie Black Sun: The Nanking Massacre, plus I've read two in-depth reviews of this movie.  But nothing could totally prepare me for the atrocities I was about to witness in CITY OF LIFE AND DEATH.  The fact that this story is totally true makes it impossible to disregard, even for the most jaded of gorehounds like myself.Superbly acted and shot in beautiful black and white, Director Lu Chuan somehow brings an element of grace and elegance to a barbaric story.  The fact he seems to be holding back on the overall horrors of this terrible moment is evident.  It's almost like he slices your throat and then gives you an oxygen mask to breathe.There is an early war scene that stands alone as one of the most powerful and haunting scenes ever filmed in the history of cinema.  I won't comment on the details, but it is guaranteed to leave you frozen in your seat.  It is completely riveting, however it also proves to be this film's only downfall.  The entire rest of the movie seems pretty anti-climatic.For any person with a thirst for history, regardless of the harsh realities that this encompasses, CITY OF LIFE AND DEATH is essential viewing.

1290196,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B002UOKXNS,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[19, 22]","For many years, I have been waiting for a powerful film that would show people of the atrocities that took place from December 1937-January 1938 in the capital city of Nanking.While there have been several films on what occurred in Nanking over seventy years ago, young writer/director Lu Chuan accomplished what many felt he couldn't do, to create a realistic portrayal of the genocide.Known as the Nanking Massacre and also the ""Rape of Nanking"", the atrocities were committed during the Second Sino-Japanese War when the soldiers of the Imperial Japanese Army slaughtered civilians of all ages, raped women until they died.  It is estimated that 300,000 people were massacred.Despite records kept by Nazi-supporter John Rabe (the person who tried to save the Chinese in Nanking by developing a safe zone) , the records kept by Westerners working for the Red Cross or were missionaries and journalists and residents who witnessed the atrocities, to this day, the genocide of the civilians of Nanking is still being disputed by Japanese nationalists who believe that the massacre was fabricated.Needless to say, because of the war and atrocities that were committed during the war, it remains to be a tense and problematic situation between both countries today.I have researched the Nanking (or Nanjing) Massacre since I was in college, as my eyes were opened to the atrocities committed, I know that many people around the world are not familiar of what happened to the Chinese people.  And since the '90s, I have been wanting to see novels receive film adaptations and while there have been several films featuring John Rabe and also bits and pieces of the battle of Nanking, there have not been many movies that would realistically capture the battle but also the atrocities committed by the Japanese Imperial troops towards the Chinese people of Nanking.Especially since its a touchy subject and the fact that many Chinese still hold a lot of pain and anger towards the Japanese because of the war.  And for director Lu Chuan, his goal was to create a realistic portrayal of the atrocities committed towards the innocent civilians of Nanking but also to show a sympathetic side to the Japanese and show that while what the Japanese Imperial soldiers did do to Chinese was barbaric, it does not make the whole country barbaric.In an interview with Empire Magazine, Lu Chuan said, ""Yes, Japanese people committed a crime but maybe it's not a fault of a certain nation, maybe it's a fault of the war, so I'm not going to make a movie against a certain nation, but against the war. If the government forces us to go to the battlefield, everybody can be a killer.""But most importantly, it was a film that Chuan, who did countless research, lived and studied in Nanking wanted the film for people outside of China to know about what took place in Nanking.""City of Life and Death"" was created with a budget of $10 million, casting of hundreds of people which would include both Chinese and Japanese talent and the film would receive rave reviews from critics worldwide and would win numerous awards around the world for ""Best Film"" and ""Best Cinematography"".VIDEO:""City of Life and Death"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1), black and white.  Director Lu Chuan was influenced by Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"" and felt the film should be kept in black and white and the decision to do so, in my opinion, made the film quite effective.  Because the film already focuses on the atrocities committed by the Japanese towards the Chinese citizens, the film would be too gory to watch if we were to see blood everywhere.  But by no means does that mean picture quality would be inferior.In fact, this film is enhanced by its high details.  From the worn out skin of the soldiers, the grime on the skin and dark blood (which is seen as black) on the soldiers is shown effectively in HD as well as the clothing as you can see the stitching patterns and the threading with clarity.  Skin pigments with clarity.  Especially with the destruction of buildings during the battle, the scene of Nanking looks realistic in the film.Black levels are deep while whites and grays have amazing contrast and the picture is sharp.But I must credit cinematographer Yu Cao for capturing the brutality and the massacres with his camera shots.  What is captured on camera is heartbreaking, stunning and realistic.  The details are in the eyes, shots of fear, panic, despair...and people with tears knowing that they are not going to survive the ordeal... I was literally captivated and sickened at the same time.  To know that what is shown on screen is non-fiction and these atrocities took place (and many situations even worse as seen in photos from Nanking), many times during the film, I had to pause and collect myself.This is the second time this has ever happened to me, the other time was watching Alain Resnais' ""Night and Fog"", a documentary about the Nazi concentration camps.  But the fact that a film such as ""City of Life and Death"" can have this much of an effect, it goes to show how viscerally powerful this film is.So, overall...picture quality is magnificent, cinematography is fantastic!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:The lossless soundtrack of ""City of Life and Death"" is magnificent.  Presented in Mandarin DTS-HD Matster Audio 5.1, let me first preface and say that there are not many Asian films (non-animated) that I have watched and felt were immersive but I have to say that the soundtrack for this film is hauntingly immersive as one can expect from a war film.From the battle between the Chinese and Japanese, to hear the bullets zipping from all around you, to hear the gunfire, the tanks and mortar rounds going off close by or to a distance, to hear explosions from a distance and to hear the screams whenever a soldier shoots in the air, the realism of fear, sadness, pain and everything brutal that can be heard in a film about the massacre of innocent people is captured on the soundtrack of ""City of Life and Death"".To have a film that can captivate you visually but also via audio, needless to say, I was quite impressed and as Yu Cao did a wonderful job with cinematography, Tong Liu did a magnificent job with the music of the film.With powerful visuals and powerful audio, needless to say, ""City of Life and Death"" was certainly an experience.  I heard no problems with the audio, Mandarin was crystal clear, each artillery fire was amazingly clear and once again, this lossless soundtrack is absolutely immersive and enhances your appreciation for the film!As for subtitles, English subtitles are optional and are easy to read.SPECIAL FEATURES""City of Life and Death"" comes with the following special features:Disc 1:Kino Lorber TrailersStills - Featuring stills from ""City of Life and Death""Disc 2:Matters of Life and Death - (1:53:56) It's important to note that the second disc is not a Blu-ray but a DVD.  The documentary or making-of features an interview with director Lu Chuan and the talent. But we learn how much of a challenge it was to create this film but also how the talent felt the power of this film and what they felt at the time of making the film.EXTRAS:""City of Life and Death"" comes with a slipcase cover.JUDGMENT CALL:Heartbreaking, brutal but the most honest portrayal of the atrocities committed  in Nanking for cinema.For so long, I have waited for a film of this caliber to be made on the ""Rape of Nanking"".  Because it would probably answer a lot of questions for many people of why there are continued tensions between China and Japan.  But also to understand how war can make regular people do terrible things.Back in college, I learned a lot about the Armenian Genocide and Nanking Massacres but while my college due to its large Armenian student population would have memorials for those who were killed, there is not much out there for people to know about what transpired in Nanking in 1937-1938 unless you go out and look for it.Having studied Asian culture (especially with focus on Japanese culture), it was interesting to see things on brother's side who is more closer to Chinese culture and him experiencing first hand through his Chinese father-in-law of the long-lasting pain and anger that Chinese have towards Japanese.  It was an intriguing juxtaposition because I recently wrote about how my grandfather fought against the Japanese in World War II but he told me that what happened then was due to war.So, as I was researching this film, I ran a quote by director Lu Chuan with Filmmaker in which the director said, ""Why is there war? I wanted to make a movie about the Nanjing massacre, but then I started to explore the history of massacres, during the Ming and Qing dynasties, and learned they happened everywhere. It's not something that belongs to Japanese people. So I decided to [articulate] this kind of feeling in my movie. I don't want my son or daughter, younger brother or sister to look at the Japanese [in the] way [we did]. It's not true. The massacre was in 1937. After 70 years, we have to reconsider it from a different angle. The Japanese troops were criminal -- but the biggest criminal was the war itself. It twisted human nature. It pushed normal people to pull the trigger. I was in the army for several years, you know. I know if I was in uniform on the battlefield, I would pull the trigger on strangers if the [military] authorities asked me to.""And in China, since childhood, people are taught about what happened during their war against Japan and what Japan did to them, it doesn't help when Japanese nationals continue to say that the genocide was fabricated.  And while the modern younger generation (in Japan) feels no attachment to what transpired in the past, they are not taught about the atrocities committed by their own people and pretty much, it's part of the history that is hidden from them.  But many young people know that Japan at the time, are responsible for a lot of terrible things due to war, a lot of other countries have also done the same throughout time.So, war is always ugly and war brings out the worst in humanity.And what happened to the people of Nanking back in December 1937-January 1938 is shocking, disturbing and you can't believe how people can be so cruel and barbaric but it happened.  And there is only so much one can do by reading a book, online and seeing the photos.  But for many people, they need the visual and ""City of Life and Death"" amazingly captures the massacres, the pain, the suffering of people with so much efficacy.  People have to remember, this was a low-budget film featuring hundreds of people, many who have never worked on a film before.  But yet, each role was crucial, each scene must look realistic and for everyone who participated in this film, they did a magnificent job in making the film real for us viewers.As mentioned earlier, this is the second film where I had to pause and collect my thoughts and just take time and wait a few minutes because the massacre of innocents was making me feel sickened and to the point where I felt like crying because I have never seen humanity become so cruel to innocent people.  I know genocide has happened within my lifetime but what took place in Nanking is shocking.  From the massacre of 300,000 people, from soldiers having contests on how many people they can behead (and this was featured in a major Japanese newspaper publication as two soldiers were having a contest), to the rape of thousands of women and girls who were raped repeatedly until they died.  And there was no respect for these women.  These soldiers did their thing and not shown in this film but you can find photos are what soldiers inserted in women after they killed them.And what is so unforgettable are the details captured by the cinematography of the film, when thousands are shot to death, people being buried alive, trying to escape but they can't.  But just looking at the eyes of the characters, the tears, the lifelessness, the fear and in death.Filmmaker Lu Chuan had encountered many challenges in making of this film.  From those who didn't want to support it because of its content or that it was a film that a young director could not handle, but he proved them wrong.  He was able to write and direct a film that captured the atrocities and brutality against the Chinese people but also trying to show not exactly sympathy but to show that even the Japanese like the character Kadokawa did things that he did not want to do but because it was war, he was conflicted and starts to eat upon his soul.The Blu-ray release is absolutely fantastic, from amazing picture quality and an immersive lossless soundtrack to a making-of that is not your average run-of-the mill non-exciting feature but there is a lot included in terms of sharing with the viewer of the challenges and the emotional state of the talent who took part in this film.  Because it was a thought-provoking film that has not been explored in this magnitude and the result is literally epic.In fact, this film had so much of a profound effect on me that I hope to visit the Memorial Hall of Victims of the Nanjing Massacre in Nanjing.Overall, ""City of Life and Death"" is the most visceral war film that I have seen to effectively capture the atrocities and the brutality of the Nanking massacre in cinema.  This is an unforgettable film that resonates within you for a very long time with its realistic and stunning cinematography.Director Lu Chuan has created a masterpiece!  This Blu-ray release is highly recommended!",5,"Blu-ray: Visceral, heartbreaking and unforgettable...",1323993600,"12 16, 2011",2011,13573,"['many', 'years', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'powerful',

I remember when I first learnt the french word defenestrier - it was the surname of the manager of the Robert Clergerie store and I remember thinking why would anyone need a word for THAT.Watch this movie and find out.  It's not as rare as you think.Is this movie watchable? should you watch it?I didn't want to but my inner voice told me that if they can suffer it, you can watch it on tenterhooks waiting for the facts to be reenacted - they never really do - this is all about tender innocent, crying freeman really really wishing they could go home to their geisha wives.And if the Chinese are making this movie, you'd better believe that you're going to burn for this.Minnie Vautrin returned to America and committed suicide in 1941 so apparently, that is ANOTHER good reason that this movie is another Nanjing Lite production; what is this?The Ring (Widescreen Edition)?Grrr.  Well, I will not be offing myself not now not ever and certainly not because of this film.So you'd better know they know that you tortured BEAUTIFUL young men; they know about the rapes, the mutilations, the ""science"" experiments involving ingestion of mercury and dyes, the examination of prettier cheekbones by cutting into boys' faces because they madeBeastlyand they didn't even MENTION Germany or Japan:They KNOW and they aren't going to let you Rollo Tomasi your way out of town.They know JG Ballard had nightmares for the rest of his life even though he seemed to be survivin' inEmpire of the Sun (Keepcase).  It's no accident that Christian Bale would be cast inFlowers of War.So enjoy your delusions of popularity.  Vampires can't see their own reflection and that's why you won't comprehend that the inclusion of some matinee idol KIND Japanese murderer-rapist who can be reasoned with, ENTREATED - that makes it worse for your reputation not better BECAUSE it shows what the audience knows NEVER happened and it comforts them NOT AT ALL just like Young Voldemort's feigned sympathy forThe Boy in the Striped Pajamas.Did Lucie Blackman beg for her life?  What about Lindsay Ann Hawker?  Ren&eacute;e Hartevelt wasn't the first girl to be eaten by a Japanese.  It already happened to Chinese girls but that's not in this movie either.

1290200,A328S9RN3U5M68,B002UOKXNS,Grady Harp,"[10, 11]","CITY OF LIFE AND DEATH  is a masterpiece - of film making, of finding the midline of response to war from both sides, of cautiously but successfully blending intimate stories with the gory atrocities of war, and of recreating a period of history we too soon forget unless prodded by works such as this. Lu Chuan both wrote and directed this vision of the 1937 decimation of Nanking, the capital of China, by the Japanese that lasted in action for only six weeks but that has been a permanent festering wound on the history of mankind that will always be a reminder to what War is about.Subtitled NANKING! NANKING! the audience is led to expect a film honoring the Chinese who bravely fought to resist of the Japanese invasion and ultimate destruction of the then capital of China.  Instead the writer/director elects to put us in the midst of the war, showing all aspects of how war changes and affects and destroys people. The black and white film is able to create the illusion that we are actually in 1937 Nanking.  We meet several important personalities from that time: the Chinese Resistance leader Lu Jianxiong (the inordinately gifted and handsome actor Ye Liu), the Chinese schoolteacher Miss Jiang (Yuanyuan Gao) who fights constantly to save her people, the Nazi German John Rabe (John Paisley) who maintains a Safety Zone to protect the Chinese until the Nazis recall him to avoid insulting their Japanese allies, Rabe's Chinese assistant and translator Mr Tang (Wei Fan) and his wife (Lan Qin) who despite the suffering they endure from the Japanese still are selfless in the choices they make to help their people, and Kadokawa (and impressive Hideo Nakaizumi) who as a Japanese soldier is a symbol for those warriors who are conflicted about the cruelty inflicted on the Chinese. These individuals provide stories with the story that allow the viewer to connect to the human aspect of the victims and the perpetrators of the annihilation we are witnessing.  There are devastating scenes of the forced 'comfort houses' created to keep the Japanese soldiers happy, the demanded selection of 100 Chinese women to provide physical gratification to the enemy, the massacre of thousands of citizens - men, women, children - and the destruction of the very city itself.  But Lu Chuan balances these with some very tender moments, such as the first sexual encounter of a virgin soldier with a prostitute and how he interprets this experience as love to the point of providing as much gratitude and safety to the prostitute as he can, and the incredibly tender scenes between Lu Jianxiong and a little boy who brings him bullets.The cast is stunning and while many of us do not recognize the faces, they are obviously some of the cream of the crop of Chinese and Japanese actors.  Yu Cao is in charge of the very realistic and photographically perfect cinematography and the musical score by Tony Liu is not only appropriate for the theme of the film but also provides some very simple Western piano music for the intimate scenes.  There are multiple choices of subtitles including English. CITY OF LIFE AND DEATH not only documents a piece of martial history that is important to remember, but it is also another way of viewing how WAR can alter the minds and lives of those on both side of the battle.  Highly Recommended.

1290203,A18JUJK45EXE4,B002UOKXNS,Jared M,"[7, 7]","Although widely reported at the time, the events in Nanking during the period 1937 to 1938 was really only brought to popular awareness in the Western world with the 1997 publication of Iris Chang's book ""The Rape of Nanking"".  Since then, there have been a number of film and television productions that have been based on the fall of Nanking.  ""City of Life and Death"" is a recent entrant in the Nanking genre, but it is probably one of the best due to its high production values.The plot is based around the fall of Nanking, and the subsequent atrocities, as seen through the eyes of Kadokawa, a young Japanese soldier experiencing the horrors of war, and the evils perpetuated by his comrades as the populace is ruthlessly suppressed by the Japanese.  Sections of the narrative are provided from the Chinese and Western participants, notably John Rabe, the ""Good Nazi"", who oversaw the ""Safety Zone"" together with his Chinese assistant Mr. Tang and his wife.  These individuals attempted to protect a number of civilians as well as wounded KMT soldiers by harbouring them in the Safety Zone, even though the Japanese regularly ignored the neutrality of the Safety Zone.Filmed entirely in black and white, ""City of Life and Death"" had a decent production budget of around $12,000,000 according to Imdb.com, and this is clearly apparent in the battle sequences.  The main battle sequence is simply stunning and will invite comparisons to the final battle sequence in ""Saving Private Ryan"".  There appear to be a staggering number of extras as well, and this adds significant impact to the crowd scenes - notably the opening sequence in which Chinese militia attempt to break out of Nanking while the regular KMT soldiers attempt to keep them within the city.  The editing and cinematography is top drawer stuff.  A minor grizzle is that at certain points in the narrative, postcards written in english are used as fact/caption cards to update the viewer on background events - because these are already in english, the captions are only translated into Chinese subtitles. However, the english cursive script on the postcards is actually quite hard to read in the time available.Given it is a Chinese film, it was interesting to see that the key role of Kadokawa is sympathetically treated, and the film's director was critised for this in mainland China.  Japanese actor Hideo Nakaizumi gives a compelling performance as Kadokawa, and one gets a sense of the character's moral dilemmas.  His compatriot Ryu Kohata puts in a chilling turn as Kadokawa's superior officer.  Ye Liu (from ""Curse of the Golden Flower"") is steady in his role as a KMT soldier, and is overshadowed by the female members of the cast, particularly Jiang Yiyan as Mrs. Jiang.""City of Life and Death"" is not easy viewing; the battle sequences are intense, and the atrocities are realistically depicted (scenes of rape are treated with relative restraint).  It is most certainly grim to watch.  Nonetheless, ""City of Life and Death"" is one of those rare ""must see"" movies, in the vein of Schlinder's List, for its tragic portrayal of the events of 1937, in Nanking.",5,Disturbing but gripping viewing,1291593600,"12 6, 2010",2010,3138,"['widely', 'reported', 'time', 'events', 'Nanking', 'period', '1937', '1938', 'was', 'really', 'only', 'brought', 'popular', 'awareness', 'Western', 'world', '1997', 'publication', 'Iris', 'Chang', 'book', 'Rape', 'Nanking', 'then', 'have', 'been', 'number', 'film', 'television', 'productions', 'have', 'been', 'based', 'fall', 'Nanking', 'City', 'Life', 'Death', 'recent', 'entrant', 'Nanking', 'genre', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'due', 'high', 'production', 'values.The', 'plot', 'based', 'fall', 'Nanking', 'subsequent', 'atrocities', 'seen', 'eyes', 'Kadokawa', 'young', 'Japanese', 'soldier', 'experiencing', 'horrors', 'war', 'evils', 'perpetuated', 'comrades', 'populace', 'ruthlessly', 'suppressed', 'Japanese', 'Sections', 'narrative', 'are', 'provided', 'Chinese', 'Western', 'participants', 'notably', 'John', 'Rabe', 'Good', 'Nazi', 'who', 'oversaw', 'Safety', 'Zone', 'together', 'Chinese', 'assistant', 'Mr.', 'Tang', 'wife', 'individuals', 'attempted', 'protect', 'number', 'civilians', 'as', 'well', 'wounded', 'KMT', 'soldiers', 'harbouring', 'Safety', 'Zone', 'even', 'Japanese', 'regularly', 'ignored', 'neutrality', 'Safety', 'Zone.Filmed', 'entirely', 'black', 'white', 'City', 'Life', 'Death', 'had', 'decent', 'production', 'budget', '12,000,000', 'according', 'Imdb.com', 'clearly', 'apparent', 'battle', 'sequences', 'main', 'battle', 'sequence', 'simply', 'stunning', 'will', 'invite', 'comparisons', 'final', 'battle', 'sequence', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'appear', 'be', 'staggering', 'number', 'extras', 'as', 'well', 'significant', 'impact', 'crowd', 'notably', 'opening', 'sequence', 'Chinese', 'militia', 'attempt', 'break', 'Nanking', 'regular', 'KMT', 'soldiers', 'attempt', 'keep', 'city', 'editing', 'cinematography', 'top', 'drawer', 'stuff', 'minor', 'grizzle', 'certain', 'points', 'narrative', 'postcards', 'written', 'english', 'are', 'used', 'fact/caption', 'cards', 'update', 'viewer', 'background', 'events', 'are', 'already', 'english', 'captions', 'are', 'only', 'translated', 'Chinese', 'subtitles', 'However', 'english', 'cursive', 'script', 'postcards', 'actually', 'quite', 'hard', 'read', 'time', 'Chinese', 'film', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'key', 'role', 'Kadokawa', 'sympathetically', 'treated', 'film', 'director', 'was', 'critised', 'mainland', 'China', 'Japanese', 'actor', 'Hideo', 'Nakaizumi', 'compelling', 'performance', 'Kadokawa', 'one', 'sense', 'character', 'moral', 'dilemmas', 'compatriot', 'Ryu', 'Kohata', 'chilling', 'turn', 'Kadokawa', 'superior', 'officer', 'Liu', 'Curse', 'Golden', 'Flower', 'steady', 'role', 'KMT', 'soldier', 'overshadowed', 'female', 'members', 'cast', 'particularly', 'Jiang', 'Yiyan', 'Mrs', 'Jiang', 'City', 'Life', 'Death', 'not', 'easy', 'viewing', 'battle', 'sequences', 'are', 'intense', 'atrocities', 'are', 'realistically', 'depicted', 'scenes', 'rape', 'are', 'treated', 'relative', 'restraint', 'most', 'certainly', 'grim', 'watch', 'Nonetheless', 'City', 'Life', 'Death', 'one', 'rare', 'must', 'see', 'movies', 'vein', 'Schlinder', 'List', 'tragic', 'portrayal', 'events', '1937', 'Nanking']",N/A
1290204,A2COCRWXXUQI8G,B002UOKXNS,J. Bradley,"[3, 3]","""City of Life and Death"" is - like ""Schindler's List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" - a viscerally real look at a period of history that cinematically shakes our perception of that era and events. In this case it's ""The Rape of Nanking"" when the Japanese invaded China in 1937-'38. On one hand I tend to think the style of washed-out, black and white, grainy cinematography - to emulate the look of World War Two era photographs - has become a cliche. But the director here, Lu Chuan, has managed to bring that same incredible weight that Spielberg brought when you FIRST saw HIS movies of that era, back again as though you've not seen anything interpreted this way before. The story follows many characters and their fates through the initial invasion, the slaughter of prisoners and the ""comfort stations"" set up for the Japanese soldiers. The movie is pretty damning of the invading Japanese and an ending that contrasts that very traditional society from the brutality we've seen carried out in the two hours before you get to that point - really forbodes the end of Imperial Japan as we realize a society that hides such brutality under such a civil and ""traditional"" facade, simply could not stand. The many dramas of each individual character are poignant and sometimes quite grim. The titles at the end show us the dates of those who died and surprisingly those few that survived this massacre some living on for decades.

1290207,A3ODKKGVALLI2G,B002UOKXNS,Keris Nine,"[36, 37]","As far as definitions for Hell on Earth go, the assault on the Chinese city of Nanking by the invading Japanese army in 1937 is certainly on a par with the horrors of the worst of the Nazi concentration camps.  Ruthlessly and systematically wiping out of the Chinese army soldiers defending the town, the abuse, torture and mass execution of citizens and the notorious rape and murder of the city's women engaged as ""comfort women"" for the Japanese troops is one of the darkest moments in the history of modern war crimes.It's a harrowing subject with material of such a degree of obscenity that, despite it being a popular subject for film with several documentary attempts and another film about John Rabe released around the same time as this one, it's a difficult one to approach within the limits of what a conventional war movie can show.  Appropriately then, Lu Chuan adopts a style and approach similar to Steven Spielberg in Schindler's List, shooting in eye-catching widescreen black-and-white, taking in multiple viewpoints that chart the complete breakdown of any recognisable human qualities into barbarism on an unimaginable scale.  Initially, there's the view from the Chinese soldiers defending the city, as well as the view from a young Japanese officer Kadokawa.  The city taken, the view switches to the ""Safe Zone"" (which in reality is far from safe at all) established by the Nazi representative in the town John Rabe, seen mainly from the perspective of his Chinese assistant Mr Tang, his wife and family.City of Life and Death is an exceptionally well-made film, a true war epic, although, like Schindler's List, it could also be accused of being much too attractively photographed in glossy black-and-white, effectively glamorising a subject that should simply be unwatchable.  It's hard to imagine however how else a film about the Rape of Nanking could be made.  What matters is how honestly and effectively the film approaches the subject and the historical reality, and while it spares us graphic detail of the worst abuses, the full mounting horror of what occurred and the impact it must have had on individuals caught up within it is unquestionably fully felt.  A powerful and moving film then and essential viewing, but like Schindler's List, perhaps not one you'd want to come back to watch very often.",4,The Rape of Nanking,1269216000,"03 22, 2010",2010,2335,"['As', 'far', 'definitions', 'Hell', 'Earth', 'go', 'assault', 'Chinese', 'city', 'Nanking', 'invading', 'Japanese', 'army', '1937', 'certainly', 'par', 'horrors', 'worst', 'Nazi', 'concentration', 'camps', 'Ruthlessly', 'systematically', 'wiping', 'Chinese', 'army', 'soldiers', 'defending', 'town', 'abuse', 'torture', 'mass', 'execution', 'citizens', 'notorious', 'rape', 'murder', 'city', 'women', 'engaged', 'comfort', 'women', 'Japanese', 'troops', 'one', 'darkest', 'moments', 'history', 'modern', 'war', 'crimes.It', 'harrowing', 'subject', 'material', 'such', 'degree', 'obscenity', 'being', 'popular', 'subject', 'film', 'several', 'documentary', 'attempts', 'film', 'John', 'Rabe', 'released', 'same', 'time', 'one', 'difficult', 'one', 'approach', 'limits', 'what', 'conventional', 'war', 'movie', 'can', 'show', 'Appropriately', 'then', 'Lu', 'Chuan', 'style', 'approach', 'similar', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'Schindler', 'List', 'shooting', 'eye-catching', 'widescreen', 'black-and-white', 'taking', 'multiple', 'viewpoints', 'chart', 'complete', 'breakdown', 'recognisable', 'human', 'qualities', 'barbarism', 'unimaginable', 'scale', 'Initially', 'view', 'Chinese', 'soldiers', 'defending', 'city', 'as', 'well', 'view', 'young', 'Japanese', 'officer', 'Kadokawa', 'city', 'taken', 'view', 'Safe', 'Zone', 'reality', 'far', 'safe', 'established', 'Nazi', 'representative', 'town', 'John', 'Rabe', 'seen', 'mainly', 'perspective', 'Chinese', 'assistant', 'Mr', 'Tang', 'wife', 'family.City', 'Life', 'Death', 'exceptionally', 'well-made', 'film', 'true', 'war', 'epic', 'Schindler', 'List', 'could', 'also', 'be', 'accused', 'being', 'much', 'too', 'attractively', 'photographed', 'glossy', 'black-and-white', 'effectively', 'glamorising', 'subject', 'should', 'simply', 'be', 'unwatchable', 'hard', 'imagine', 'however', 'how', 'else', 'film', 'Rape', 'Nanking', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'What', 'how', 'honestly', 'effectively', 'film', 'subject', 'historical', 'reality', 'graphic', 'detail', 'worst', 'abuses', 'full', 'mounting', 'horror', 'what', 'occurred', 'impact', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'individuals', 'caught', 'up', 'unquestionably', 'fully', 'felt', 'powerful', 'moving', 'film', 'then', 'essential', 'viewing', 'Schindler', 'List', 'perhaps', 'not', 'one', ""'d"", 'want', 'come', 'back', 'watch', 'very', 'often']",N/A

1290212,AGVWTYW0ULXHT,B002UOKXNS,"Nathan Andersen ""Gadget lover and author of S...","[39, 42]","This epic film about the siege and massacre of Nanking in 1937 by Japanese forces pulls no punches, and depicts things as they were, at least as best as that can be accomplished while focused on the perspectives of a small number of recognizable characters.  While there are heroic acts on the part of a few, there are no real heroes here who manage to make it through all the way against all odds.  In the face of this atrocity, there is no Schindler to save the day (for some), and the Nazi businessman who does try to protect some of the women and children left behind when their husbands have been executed, ends up leaving, with regrets, when he's called back by the German leadership who are unwilling to risk antagonizing Japan.  While there are atrocious acts on the part of many, the film does not seek to demonize so much as to demonstrate the devastation of war on all who are a part of it.  The film doesn't in any way excuse the rapes and the murder of civilians that did take place during this awful event, but it does manage to make clear that many who perpetrated these actions had been damaged by the war and had reached a point where they had become numb, where the prevalence of death had deadened them to the possibilities of the life and love they destroyed.Celebrated Chinese director Lu Chuan, whose previous film was the very effective but much smaller scaleMountain Patrol: Kekexili, makes the unconventional (and, as it turned out highly controversial in his home country) decision to convey events largely from the perspective of a young Japanese officer, named Kadokawa.  Following a brief introduction that establishes some of the historical backdrop, the film opens on the sleeping face of Kadokawa, who awakens in the midst of the siege and is greeted by friends, excited for his army's success.  We see, though, that he is not entirely insensitive to the impact of his fellow soldier's actions on the lives of those who remain in the city.  We follow his perspective intermittently throughout, and where the ultimate sympathies of the film lie clearly lie with the besieged Chinese, it is clear by the end that Kadokawa and many of his fellow soldiers were also victims of the war.  Apart from following the fates of a number of different characters, the film does not offer a conventional narrative arc that would focus on the struggles of a protagonist - this is, rather, a portrait of the massacre as a whole, that never loses sight of the fact that its victims (and its perpetrators) are all individuals.  It also does not dwell exclusively on horrors, but shows that in the midst of things still children play, that friends and lovers find ways to assure one another of their affection, and that the living often can find grounds for hope and reasons to persevere even when events are awful, as when a Chinese soldier who'd been captured for a likely execution along with a young boy, looks to the boy to smile and they touch foreheads, to reassure the young man of his friendship, rather than dwell on his own likely fate.Even though it was made recently, the film is captured in a vibrant black and white - and it is a good thing, too, because it establishes something of a historical distance, that manages to at least soften some of the still awful horrors the film conveys without flinching.  The camera is handheld through much of the film, giving the feel of a documentary camera on the ground; it also steps back on occasion to establish a sense of location and a sense of the scale of what was taking place.  The music is mostly atmospheric, giving a sense of the period, and while it never feels like manipulation because the feelings evoked are genuine and warranted, the filmmakers don't shy from occasionally using song to emphasize the courage or resilience of the Chinese in the face of the massacre, or to emphasize the awful sadness of the families and friends of the women who gave themselves to be used by the Japanese soldiers so as to protect their children.  This is not an entertaining film, it is even, I would say, a devastating film, but it is not a depressing film because it manages to capture precisely the inhuman devastation of a real situation that should not be forgotten, without losing sight of the humanity of those who lived and died through it.",4,Epic depiction of the massacre at Nanking: a devastating & powerful film that is difficult to watch but should not be ignored,1320969600,"11 11, 2011",2011,4319,"['epic', 'film', 'siege', 'massacre', 'Nanking', '1937', 'Japanese', 'forces', 'punches', 'things', 'were', 'least', 'as', 'best', 'can', 'be', 'accomplished', 'focused', 'perspectives', 'small', 'number', 'recognizable', 'characters', 'are', 'heroic', 'acts', 'part', 'few', 'are', 'real', 'heroes', 'here', 'who', 'manage', 'make', 'way', 'odds', 'face', 'atrocity', 'Schindler', 'save', 'day', 'Nazi', 'businessman', 'who', 'try', 'protect', 'women', 'children', 'left', 'behind', 'when', 'husbands', 'have', 'been', 'executed', 'up', 'leaving', 'regrets', 'when', 'called', 'back', 'German', 'leadership', 'who', 'are', 'unwilling', 'risk', 'antagonizing', 'Japan', 'are', 'atrocious', 'acts', 'part', 'many', 'film', 'not', 'seek', 'demonize', 'so', 'much', 'demonstrate', 'devastation', 'war', 'who', 'are', 'part', 'film', ""n't"", 'way', 'rapes', 'murder', 'civilians', 'did', 'take', 'place', 'awful', 'event', 'manage', 'make', 'clear', 'many', 'who', 'perpetrated', 'actions', 'had', 'been', 'damaged', 'war', 'had', 'reached', 'point', 'where', 'had', 'become', 'numb', 'where', 'prevalence', 'death', 'had', 'deadened', 'possibilities', 'life', 'love', 'destroyed.Celebrated', 'Chinese', 'director', 'Lu', 'Chuan', 'previous', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'effective', 'much', 'smaller', 'scaleMountain', 'Patrol', 'Kekexili', 'unconventional', 'turned', 'out', 'highly', 'controversial', 'home', 'country', 'decision', 'convey', 'events', 'largely', 'perspective', 'young', 'Japanese', 'officer', 'named', 'Kadokawa', 'Following', 'brief', 'introduction', 'historical', 'backdrop', 'film', 'sleeping', 'face', 'Kadokawa', 'who', 'midst', 'siege', 'greeted', 'friends', 'excited', 'army', 'success', 'see', 'though', 'not', 'entirely', 'insensitive', 'impact', 'fellow', 'soldier', 'actions', 'lives', 'who', 'remain', 'city', 'follow', 'perspective', 'intermittently', 'where', 'ultimate', 'sympathies', 'film', 'lie', 'clearly', 'lie', 'besieged', 'Chinese', 'clear', 'end', 'Kadokawa', 'many', 'fellow', 'soldiers', 'were', 'also', 'victims', 'war', 'Apart', 'following', 'fates', 'number', 'different', 'characters', 'film', 'not', 'offer', 'conventional', 'narrative', 'arc', 'would', 'focus', 'struggles', 'protagonist', 'rather', 'portrait', 'massacre', 'whole', 'never', 'sight', 'fact', 'victims', 'perpetrators', 'are', 'individuals', 'also', 'not', 'dwell', 'exclusively', 'horrors', 'midst', 'things', 'still', 'children', 'play', 'friends', 'lovers', 'find', 'ways', 'assure', 'one', 'affection', 'living', 'often', 'can', 'find', 'grounds', 'hope', 'reasons', 'persevere', 'even', 'when', 'events', 'are', 'awful', 'when', 'Chinese', 'soldier', 'who', ""'d"", 'been', 'captured', 'likely', 'execution', 'young', 'boy', 'boy', 'smile', 'touch', 'foreheads', 'reassure', 'young', 'man', 'friendship', 'rather', 'dwell', 'own', 'likely', 'fate.Even', 'was', 'made', 'recently', 'film', 'captured', 'vibrant', 'black', 'white', 'good', 'thing', 'too', 'something', 'historical', 'distance', 'least', 'soften', 'still', 'awful', 'horrors', 'film', 'conveys', 'flinching', 'camera', 'handheld', 'much', 'film', 'giving', 'feel', 'documentary', 'camera', 'ground', 'also', 'back', 'occasion', 'establish', 'sense', 'location', 'sense', 'scale', 'what', 'was', 'taking', 'place', 'music', 'mostly', 'atmospheric', 'giving', 'sense', 'period', 'never', 'manipulation', 'feelings', 'evoked', 'are', 'genuine', 'warranted', 'filmmakers', 'do', ""n't"", 'shy', 'occasionally', 'using', 'song', 'emphasize', 'courage', 'resilience', 'Chinese', 'face', 'massacre', 'emphasize', 'awful', 'sadness', 'families', 'friends', 'women', 'who', 'gave', 'be', 'used', 'Japanese', 'soldiers', 'so', 'protect', 'children', 'not', 'entertaining', 'film', 'even', 'would', 'say', 'devastating', 'film', 'not', 'depressing', 'film', 'capture', 'precisely', 'inhuman', 'devastation', 'real', 'situation', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'forgotten', 'losing', 'sight', 'humanity', 'who', 'lived', 'died']",N/A

1290217,A34ZM36508LG9G,B002UOKXNS,R. A Forczyk,"[2, 2]","Thanks to the late Iris Chang, many more Westerners are familiar with the Rape of Nanking in 1937 than were heretofore the case. However Chang's prose only delivered a taste of this infamous atrocity committed by the Imperial Japanese Army, with many details left to the imagination. This film serves to fill that gap, at least to some extent, with shocking and visceral coverage of the six weeks of barbarity that followed the Japanese occupation of Nanking. There was far more combat than I expected in this film, since the KMT army really didn't put up much of a fight here, and the action sequences are extremely good and accurate. The attention to minor details in uniforms and equipment is exquisite. On the other hand, the manner in which most of the Japanese atrocities are depicted is less than I expected. Thousands of prisoners are machine-gunned and a few dozen women are raped (mostly off-screen or briefly depicted), some others are buried or burned alive, but I thought a great deal was left out (e.g. like the beheading contests and the visit of the Japanese Crown Prince, which some believe contributed to the massacre). Perhaps the oddest thing about this film is the scale. In real life, thousands of Japanese soldiers and tens of thousands of Chinese were involved across a huge city, but in this film the director limited himself to a cast of several hundreds and a few blocks of film set, which made the Rape of Nanking seem smaller than it was. Overall, well worth watching if you are interested in the Sino-Japanese War or modern Chinese historical films.Easily the two most central characters in the film are Mr. Tang, a Chinese intellectual who works for John Rabe (the German businessman running the International Safety Zone), and Private Kadokawa, a Japanese soldier. After we witness most of the Chinese soldiers defeated and executed after making a forlorn defense of the city, the film focuses on the efforts of Mr. Tang to save his wife and daughter from the atrocities that he suspects are about to occur. Tang does what any self-respecting patriot would do: he goes to the Japanese commander and in return for a piece of paper that declares him a ""friend"" of the Japanese army, he betrays the fact that many wounded Chinese soldiers are still hiding in the safety zone. After thanking Mr. Tang, Japanese soldiers promptly invade the safety zone and massacre all the wounded Chinese soldiers. Yet the Japanese quickly forget their deal with Tang and in a scuffle, a Japanese soldier tosses his daughter out of a window. Many viewers will regard this scene as horrifying and tragic, but this is not Schindler's List. I found its depiction poignant and even hilarious that a collaborator would willingly cooperate with murderers and rapists, helping them in their atrocities, and then be shocked when they dishonor their agreement and target his family next. Collaboration has always been a touchy subject in European war films but here, the director seems to be coming down clearly that the wages of treason will be repaid in kind.As for Private Kadokawa, he was supposed to be the sensitive Japanese soldier who is a witness to these atrocities and is ultimately marked by them. Early in the film, Kadokawa is more a less a standard private who fights as part of a platoon and acts in a manner one would expect. Most of his platoon is killed in a Chinese ambush just before the fall of the city (one of the best parts of the film, with better city-fighting than Stalingrad). Afterwards, Kadokawa seems to spend most of the film just wandering around the city, with few if any military duties. Sorry, that is just not the Imperial Japanese Army way. Also, he seems to morph into an officer (complete with sword) and possible religious acolyte, about half-way through the film. After awhile, I found Kadokawa's character becoming so implausible that it was annoying to see him appear on screen. I thought the whole effort to introduce a sympathetic Japanese character into this scenario was anachronistic and ill-judged. Imagine if Spielberg had tried to put a ""sensitive"" Nazi in Schindler's List? Consequently, the viewers are never really exposed to a Japanese viewpoint that condones what thousands of their troops were participating in.On the military side, the use of Japanese tanks, mortars, machineguns, etc in the film was excellent. Larger events outside Nanking were addressed with annotated postcards, which were succinct but effective.",4,So China can make good war films,1338249600,"05 29, 2012",2012,4480,"['Thanks', 'late', 'Iris', 'Chang', 'many', 'more', 'Westerners', 'are', 'familiar', 'Rape', 'Nanking', '1937', 'were', 'heretofore', 'case', 'However', 'Chang', 'prose', 'only', 'delivered', 'taste', 'infamous', 'atrocity', 'committed', 'Imperial', 'Japanese', 'Army', 'many', 'details', 'left', 'imagination', 'film', 'fill', 'gap', 'least', 'extent', 'shocking', 'visceral', 'coverage', 'six', 'weeks', 'barbarity', 'followed', 'Japanese', 'occupation', 'Nanking', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'combat', 'expected', 'film', 'KMT', 'army', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'put', 'up', 'much', 'fight', 'here', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'extremely', 'good', 'accurate', 'attention', 'minor', 'details', 'uniforms', 'equipment', 'exquisite', 'other', 'hand', 'manner', 'most', 'Japanese', 'atrocities', 'are', 'depicted', 'less', 'expected', 'Thousands', 'prisoners', 'are', 'machine-gunned', 'few', 'dozen', 'women', 'are', 'raped', 'mostly', 'off-screen', 'briefly', 'depicted', 'others', 'are', 'buried', 'burned', 'alive', 'thought', 'great', 'deal', 'was', 'left', 'out', 'e.g', 'beheading', 'contests', 'visit', 'Japanese', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'believe', 'contributed', 'massacre', 'Perhaps', 'oddest', 'thing', 'film', 'scale', 'real', 'life', 'thousands', 'Japanese', 'soldiers', 'tens', 'thousands', 'Chinese', 'were', 'involved', 'huge', 'city', 'film', 'director', 'limited', 'cast', 'several', 'hundreds', 'few', 'blocks', 'film', 'set', 'made', 'Rape', 'Nanking', 'seem', 'smaller', 'was', 'Overall', 'well', 'watching', 'are', 'interested', 'Sino-Japanese', 'War', 'modern', 'Chinese', 'historical', 'films.Easily', 'two', 'most', 'central', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'Mr.', 'Tang', 'Chinese', 'intellectual', 'who', 'John', 'Rabe', 'German', 'businessman', 'running', 'International', 'Safety', 'Zone', 'Private', 'Kadokawa', 'Japanese', 'soldier', 'witness', 'most', 'Chinese', 'soldiers', 'defeated', 'executed', 'making', 'forlorn', 'defense', 'city', 'film', 'efforts', 'Mr.', 'Tang', 'save', 'wife', 'daughter', 'atrocities', 'are', 'occur', 'Tang', 'what', 'self-respecting', 'patriot', 'would', 'do', 'Japanese', 'commander', 'return', 'piece', 'paper', 'friend', 'Japanese', 'army', 'fact', 'many', 'wounded', 'Chinese', 'soldiers', 'are', 'still', 'hiding', 'safety', 'zone', 'thanking', 'Mr.', 'Tang', 'Japanese', 'soldiers', 'promptly', 'invade', 'safety', 'zone', 'massacre', 'wounded', 'Chinese', 'soldiers', 'Japanese', 'quickly', 'forget', 'deal', 'Tang', 'scuffle', 'Japanese', 'soldier', 'daughter', 'window', 'Many', 'viewers', 'will', 'regard', 'scene', 'horrifying', 'tragic', 'not', 'Schindler', 'List', 'found', 'depiction', 'poignant', 'even', 'hilarious', 'collaborator', 'would', 'willingly', 'cooperate', 'murderers', 'rapists', 'helping', 'atrocities', 'then', 'be', 'shocked', 'when', 'dishonor', 'agreement', 'target', 'family', 'Collaboration', 'always', 'been', 'touchy', 'subject', 'European', 'war', 'films', 'here', 'director', 'be', 'coming', 'down', 'clearly', 'wages', 'treason', 'will', 'be', 'repaid', 'kind.As', 'Private', 'Kadokawa', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'sensitive', 'Japanese', 'soldier', 'who', 'witness', 'atrocities', 'ultimately', 'marked', 'Early', 'film', 'Kadokawa', 'more', 'less', 'standard', 'private', 'who', 'fights', 'part', 'platoon', 'acts', 'manner', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'Most', 'platoon', 'killed', 'Chinese', 'ambush', 'just', 'fall', 'city', 'one', 'best', 'parts', 'film', 'better', 'city-fighting', 'Stalingrad', 'Afterwards', 'Kadokawa', 'spend', 'most', 'film', 'just', 'wandering', 'city', 'few', 'military', 'duties', 'Sorry', 'just', 'not', 'Imperial', 'Japanese', 'Army', 'way', 'Also', 'morph', 'officer', 'complete', 'sword', 'possible', 'religious', 'acolyte', 'half-way', 'film', 'found', 'Kadokawa', 'character', 'becoming', 'so', 'implausible', 'was', 'annoying', 'see', 'appear', 'screen', 'thought', 'whole', 'effort', 'introduce', 'sympathetic', 'Japanese', 'character', 'scenario', 'was', 'anachronistic', 'ill-judged', 'Imagine', 'Spielberg', 'had', 'tried', 'put', 'sensitive', 'Nazi', 'Schindler', 'List', 'Consequently', 'viewers', 'are', 'never', 'really', 'exposed', 'Japanese', 'viewpoint', 'what', 'thousands', 'troops', 'were', 'participating', 'in.On', 'military', 'side', 'use', 'Japanese', 'tanks', 'mortars', 'machineguns', 'etc', 'film', 'was', 'excellent', 'Larger', 'events', 'Nanking', 'were', 'addressed', 'annotated', 'postcards', 'were', 'succinct', 'effective']",N/A

1290219,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B002UOKXNS,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 2]","&lt;strong>Nanjing! Nanjing!&lt;/strong> (Chuan Lu, 2009)&lt;em>Nanjing! Nanjing!&lt;/em>, released in English-speaking countries as &lt;em>City of Life and Death&lt;/em>, is the first major film that I know of since Tun Fei Mou's 1995 exploitation flick &lt;em>Black Sun&lt;/em> (cf. review 29Dec11) to deal with the horrific chain of events that have come to be known as the Rape of Nanking. Thus, it's pretty much impossible to avoid comparing the two, especially when I saw &lt;em>Black Sun&lt;/em> such a short time ago. What strikes me most about the two films is the vast difference in reception they received. Tun Fei Mou is a well-known producer of exploitation flicks, and &lt;em>Black Sun&lt;/em>, while more technically proficient than any other Mou film I've ever seen, was a part of that grand tradition. &lt;em>Nanjing! Nanjing!&lt;/em> comes from Chuan Lu, and from the critical reception, you'd think this guy was working in the same rarefied realms as Kar-Wai Wong or Apichatpong Weerasethakul. But no, Lu's two previous films are a mystery (&lt;em>The Missing Gun&lt;/em>) and an actioner (&lt;em>Mountain Patrol&lt;/em>). Is it really so hard to imagine a guy who has experience in genre film creating another exploitation flick about Nanjing? It seems to be for most critics. As I write this, the movie has a somewhat jaw-dropping 93% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and critics are throwing around sound bites like ""soaring"" (&lt;em>the Wall Street Journal&lt;/em>), ""emotionally satisfying"" (&lt;em>The Seattle Times&lt;/em>), ""among the greatest war films ever made"" (&lt;em>Cinema Writer&lt;/em>), and my personal favorite, ""It's a film strong enough to change your life"" (&lt;em>The Los Angeles Times&lt;/em>). Most of which, interestingly enough, can also be said about &lt;em>Black Sun&lt;/em> (I wouldn't count either as being among the greatest war films ever made, but the rest stands). &lt;em>Brand X&lt;/em>'s Andy Klein mentions that this one ""spares us some documented atrocities that are as bad or worse than what we see"", which is certainly a nod to Mou, who reveled in them--but (if you care about such things, this could be a spoiler alert, though I would be more comfortable writing ""obscenity alert"" instead) even Mou avoided a particular incident involving the rape of six children, which Lu drops on the viewer like a bomb. In sum (of just this opening paragraph), my thesis: &lt;em>Nanjing! Nanjing!&lt;/em> is just as much an exploitation film as is &lt;em>Black Sun&lt;/em>. I would hate to think that we're all shallow enough that the fact that one is in black and white and the other is in color is what's making the difference here, but for the life of me, I haven't found another explanation.Plot: like &lt;em>Black Sun&lt;/em>, &lt;em>Nanjing! Nanjing!&lt;/em> tells us the story of the Rape of Nanking through the eyes of two very different protagonists. The main difference between Mou's and Lu's films is that while both of Mou's main characters were Chinese, Lu splits the story evenly between a Chinese national, Mr. Tang (&lt;em>The Parking Attendant in July&lt;/em>'s Wei Fan, who if there were any justice in the world would have been nominated for an Oscar for this performance; as it was, he didn't even get a Golden Phoenix nom), longtime assistant to minor Nazi functionary John Rabe (&lt;em>Fearless&lt;/em>' John Paisley), one of the westerners in charge of Nanjing's refugee camp, and a Japanese soldier, Kadokawa (&lt;em>Tomie: Revenge&lt;/em>'s Hideo Nakaizumi), who starts off, as Japanese soldiers so often do in World War II movies set in China, full of idealism and pride, which is slowly eroded, along with his sanity and humanity, as the film progresses.The differences between the two films are, for the most part, cosmetic. Mou, being an exploitation filmmaker and not a critical favorite, went out of his way to show the film's historical accuracy (some of &lt;em>Black Sun&lt;/em>'s best shots are those where the action freezes, and Mou fades to a snapshot from 1937, showing how he recreated the scene), while Lu doesn't feel the need to do this. And, of course, there's the BW/Color difference. The acting by some of the principals in &lt;em>Nanjing! Nanjing!&lt;/em> is outstanding, specifically Wei Fan and &lt;em>Beijing Bicycle&lt;/em>'s Yuanyuan Gao (who plays Miss Jiang, the Chinese liaison to the westerners in the refugee camp), but the principals in &lt;em>Black Sun&lt;/em> weren't exactly slouches themselves. While the two do both depict a few iconic scenes (the seemingly-endless mound of bodies piled up along the bank of the Yellow River, the initial invasion of the refugee camp), they split on a few others. That said, to claim Lu's film spares us certain agonies is to overlook the impact of those he chose to add. (The one place it's possible to draw a distinction in quality, to my mind, is in a certain scene featuring Wei Fan, which is also depicted in Mou's film; Lu focuses less on the casual brutality of the act in question, though he certainly gives us that, and more on Mr. Tang's horror, sorrow, and pain. A lesser director would not have carried that off.)All that said, it is true that &lt;em>Nanjing! Nanjing!&lt;/em> is the better film, though we're talking about degrees rather than orders of magnitude. The final scene manages to be both predictable and a shameless piece of emotional manipulation, and really brings home that fact that Lu has, in fact, created an exploitation film here no less than Mou did with &lt;em>Black Sun&lt;/em> fifteen years previous; that is not to say in any way this movie is not worth watching, if you've the stomach for it. *** (note: yes, I know Apichatpong Weerasthakul is a Thai director, not Chinese.)",4,"Don't be fooled--another Nanking exploitatin film, but a very good one.",1329264000,"02 15, 2012",2012,5750,"['lt', 'strong', '>', 'Nanjing',

""City of Life and Death"" offers a rebuttal to that argument; the Rape of Nanking sadly ranks high among the great atrocities of the 20th century.In late 1937, the Japanese army conquered the then capital of China and in the months that followed their occupying force adopted a systemic policy of rape and murder: an estimated 300,000 were killed and as many as 80,000 Chinese women and girls were raped. Thankfully, writer-director Lu Chuan tells the story of this massacre in gorgeous black and white imagery, giving it a documentary feel. I have no doubt that if this movie were shot in color it would be too unbearable to watch in one sitting.""Life and Death"" is broken into two sections. The first shows the fall of Nanking. The Chinese army, cursed with horrible equipment and worse leaders, fights valiantly but is doomed. The Japanese move in and soon the Chinese trample each other in flight. These early scenes recall ""Saving Private Ryan"" in their gritty realism.The second section focuses on the occupation of Nanking, and the tone shifts from a war movie into much darker territory. As the Chinese are rounded up, we meet a few Japanese soldiers. The most important of these is Kadokawa (Hideo Nakaizumi), a grunt who becomes our eyes from the invaders' perspective. These Japanese soldiers are terrified young men trying to contain tens of thousands of terrified Chinese. This may be the last moment of balance the movie offers.Once the Japanese have secured Nanking, they abandon humanity. Waves of Chinese, soldiers and civilians, adults and children, are efficiently disposed of: incinerated, machine-gunned, bayoneted, or buried alive. A Nazi businessman, John Rabe (John Paisley), creates the Nanking Safety Zone through his diplomatic contacts, but this only offers a temporary stay of execution.""Life and Death"" is not a subtle film, nor should it be. Lu Chuan creates scenes of noble resistance in the face of unspeakable horror. One loses track of the indelible images seared into the brain: the regimented depravity of the rape rooms; the eerie war dance of Japanese soldiers through a conquered city; the horrified screams of parents as their young daughter is thrown through a third story window. It's no surprise that thousands of Chinese protested at the sympathetic portrayal of a single Japanese soldier.Some might argue that ""Life and Death"" is a propaganda film, advocating Chinese nationalism. Such critics ignore the toxic context of this movie, which comes complete with deniers. (Recently, scores of Japanese politicians went on record decrying the Rape of Nanking as a fabrication of the Chinese government.) This is not a story where a filmmaker can refuse to take sides. ""Life and Death"" tells an ugly story beautifully. To that end, it stands shoulder to shoulder with ""Schindler's List."" Watch this movie, but plan on doing something to make you smile the next day. You'll need it.The ""City of Life and Death"" DVD offers English subtitles but no dubbed version (Chinese dialogue spoken in Mandarin), movie stills and a recommended making-of documentary, ""Matters of Life and Death.""Review originally published on MyDVDInsider.com.",5,"An eye-opening, horrifying epic of one of the 20th century's truly terrible events",1321574400,"11 18, 2011",2011,3284,"['West', 'firmly', 'believe', ""'re"", 'first', 'things', 'triumphs', 'are', 'greater', 'tragedies', 'more', 'shattering', 'City', 'Life', 'Death', 'rebuttal', 'argument', 'Rape', 'Nanking', 'sadly', 'high', 'great', 'atrocities', '20th', 'century.In', 'late', '1937', 'Japanese', 'army', 'conquered', 'then', 'capital', 'China', 'months', 'followed', 'occupying', 'force', 'adopted', 'systemic', 'policy', 'rape', 'murder', 'estimated', '300,000', 'were', 'killed', 'as', 'many', '80,000', 'Chinese', 'women', 'girls', 'were', 'raped', 'Thankfully', 'writer-director', 'Lu', 'Chuan', 'story', 'massacre', 'gorgeous', 'black', 'white', 'imagery', 'giving', 'documentary', 'feel', 'have', 'doubt', 'movie', 'were', 'shot', 'color', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'unbearable', 'watch', 'one', 'sitting', 'Life', 'Death', 'broken', 'two', 'sections', 'first', 'fall', 'Nanking', 'Chinese', 'army', 'cursed', 'horrible', 'equipment', 'worse', 'leaders', 'fights', 'valiantly', 'doomed', 'Japanese', 'move', 'soon', 'Chinese', 'trample', 'other', 'flight', 'early', 'scenes', 'recall', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'gritty', 'realism.The', 'second', 'section', 'occupation', 'Nanking', 'tone', 'shifts', 'war', 'movie', 'much', 'darker', 'territory', 'Chinese', 'are', 'rounded', 'up', 'meet', 'few', 'Japanese', 'soldiers', 'most', 'important', 'Kadokawa', 'Hideo', 'Nakaizumi', 'grunt', 'who', 'eyes', 'invaders', 'perspective', 'Japanese', 'soldiers', 'are', 'terrified', 'young', 'men', 'trying', 'contain', 'tens', 'thousands', 'terrified', 'Chinese', 'may', 'be', 'last', 'moment', 'balance', 'movie', 'offers.Once', 'Japanese', 'have', 'secured', 'Nanking', 'abandon', 'humanity', 'Waves', 'Chinese', 'soldiers', 'civilians', 'adults', 'children', 'are', 'efficiently', 'disposed', 'incinerated', 'machine-gunned', 'bayoneted', 'buried', 'alive', 'Nazi', 'businessman', 'John', 'Rabe', 'John', 'Paisley', 'Nanking', 'Safety', 'Zone', 'diplomatic', 'contacts', 'only', 'temporary', 'stay', 'execution', 'Life', 'Death', 'not', 'subtle', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'Lu', 'Chuan', 'scenes', 'noble', 'resistance', 'face', 'unspeakable', 'horror', 'One', 'track', 'indelible', 'images', 'seared', 'brain', 'regimented', 'depravity', 'rape', 'rooms', 'eerie', 'war', 'dance', 'Japanese', 'soldiers', 'conquered', 'city', 'horrified', 'screams', 'parents', 'young', 'daughter', 'thrown', 'third', 'story', 'window', 'surprise', 'thousands', 'Chinese', 'protested', 'sympathetic', 'portrayal', 'single', 'Japanese', 'soldier.Some', 'might', 'argue', 'Life', 'Death', 'propaganda', 'film', 'advocating', 'Chinese', 'nationalism', 'Such', 'critics', 'ignore', 'toxic', 'context', 'movie', 'complete', 'deniers', 'Recently', 'scores', 'Japanese', 'politicians', 'went', 'record', 'decrying', 'Rape', 'Nanking', 'fabrication', 'Chinese', 'government', 'not', 'story', 'where', 'filmmaker', 'can', 'refuse', 'take', 'sides', 'Life', 'Death', 'ugly', 'story', 'beautifully', 'end', 'shoulder', 'shoulder', 'Schindler', 'List', 'movie', 'plan', 'doing', 'something', 'make', 'smile', 'next', 'day', ""'ll"", 'need', 'it.The', 'City', 'Life', 'Death', 'DVD', 'English', 'subtitles', 'dubbed', 'version', 'Chinese', 'dialogue', 'spoken', 'Mandarin', 'movie', 'stills', 'recommended', 'making-of', 'documentary', 'Matters', 'Life', 'Death', 'Review', 'originally', 'published', 'MyDVDInsider.com']",N/A

1290223,APRZ2IVM8JTLV,B002UOKXNS,The Mysterious Traveler,"[2, 3]","CITY OF LIFE AND DEATH (2009) Directed by Lu Chuan.In July, 1937, the Imperial Japanese Empire attacked China and, byDecember of that year, had captured the city of Nanking. In an actthat would characterize Imperial Japanese behaviour as well as beingthe first great genocide of the Second World War, the Imperial Armyproceded to rape, torture and murder over 300, 000 Chinese.This Chinese film dramatizes that horrific atrocity through multiplecharacters with a special focus on the Battle of Nanking, the massacreof Chinese POWs and the mass rape of Chinese women. Filmed in blackand white, the film also features the Nazi businessman John Rabe who,by creating an International Safety Zone managed to save the lives ofapproximately 250, 000 Chinese.JOHN RABE (2009) Directed by Florian Gallenberger.Starring Ulrich Tukur (as John Rabe), Teruyuki Kagawa (as PrinceYasuhiko Asaka) and Steve Buscemi.Another film--German this time-- about the Rape of Nanking focusingprimarily on John Rabe and his efforts to save the Chinese under hiscare. In color, remarkably there is very little repetition of materialhere and both films compliment the other. Where CITY deals primarilywith ground combat between Japanese and Chinese troops, this filmfocuses on the Japanese Air force's bombardment of civilian targets.Where CITY focused primarily on the mass murder of Chinese soldiers byshooting and the mass rapes of Chinese women, this film shows thenotorious beheading contest between two Japanese officers that waseagerly covered in the Japanese papers. Where CITY mentions it not atall, this film makes much of the irony of Nazi Germany saving peoplefrom genocide. Both films feature one good Japanese officer howeverCITY stays primarily with the lower echelon officers and this filmdramatizes the actions of the Japanese Generals and member of theImperial family who brought the massacre about.Both films are extremely good and two of the best and most originalfilms about World War 2 in years. Neither is better than the other justdifferent in style and focus.Both are highly recommended if extremely depressing.After watching these two films, two thoughts came to mind.1) Those WW 2 films made during the War and condemned as racist todaywere actually pretty on the mark. These films fit in well with suchearlier similar themed films like CHINA with Alan Ladd and DRAGONSEEDwith Katherine Hepburn.2) In America, these films could not be made as Hollywood considersany film portraying Non-Whites in a villainous light to be somehowracist and thus, by doing so, the American artistic community onceagain becomes enablers and apologists for genocide. It takes Chineseand German filmmakers to make such films today.I understand the Japanese are now making a movie revealing that theRape of Nanking never happened and it is all a lie by wicked Chineseand other foreigners.",4,RAPING NANKING,1323302400,"12 8, 2011",2011,2863,"['CITY', 'OF', 'LIFE', 'AND', 'DEATH', '2009', 'Directed', 'Lu', 'Chuan.In', 'July', '1937', 'Imperial', 'Japanese', 'Empire', 'attacked', 'China', 'byDecember', 'year', 'had', 'captured', 'city', 'Nanking', 'actthat', 'would', 'characterize', 'Imperial', 'Japanese', 'behaviour', 'as', 'well', 'beingthe', 'first', 'great', 'genocide', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'Imperial', 'Armyproceded', 'rape', 'torture', 'murder', '300', '000', 'Chinese.This', 'Chinese', 'film', 'horrific', 'atrocity', 'multiplecharacters', 'special', 'focus', 'Battle', 'Nanking', 'massacreof', 'Chinese', 'POWs', 'mass', 'rape', 'Chinese', 'women', 'Filmed', 'blackand', 'white', 'film', 'also', 'Nazi', 'businessman', 'John', 'Rabe', 'who', 'creating', 'International', 'Safety', 'Zone', 'managed', 'save', 'lives', 'ofapproximately', '250', '000', 'Chinese.JOHN', 'RABE', '2009', 'Directed', 'Florian', 'Gallenberger.Starring', 'Ulrich', 'Tukur', 'John', 'Rabe', 'Teruyuki', 'Kagawa', 'PrinceYasuhiko', 'Asaka', 'Steve', 'Buscemi.Another', 'film', 'German', 'time', 'Rape', 'Nanking', 'focusingprimarily', 'John', 'Rabe', 'efforts', 'save', 'Chinese', 'hiscare', 'color', 'remarkably', 'very', 'little', 'repetition', 'materialhere', 'films', 'compliment', 'other', 'Where', 'CITY', 'deals', 'primarilywith', 'ground', 'combat', 'Japanese', 'Chinese', 'troops', 'Japanese', 'Air', 'force', 'bombardment', 'civilian', 'CITY', 'focused', 'primarily', 'mass', 'murder', 'Chinese', 'soldiers', 'byshooting', 'mass', 'rapes', 'Chinese', 'women', 'film', 'thenotorious', 'beheading', 'contest', 'two', 'Japanese', 'officers', 'waseagerly', 'covered', 'Japanese', 'papers', 'Where', 'CITY', 'mentions', 'not', 'atall', 'film', 'much', 'irony', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'saving', 'peoplefrom', 'genocide', 'films', 'feature', 'one', 'good', 'Japanese', 'officer', 'howeverCITY', 'primarily', 'lower', 'echelon', 'officers', 'actions', 'Japanese', 'Generals', 'member', 'theImperial', 'family', 'who', 'brought', 'massacre', 'films', 'are', 'extremely', 'good', 'two', 'best', 'most', 'originalfilms', 'World', 'War', '2', 'years', 'better', 'other', 'justdifferent', 'style', 'are', 'highly', 'recommended', 'extremely', 'depressing.After', 'watching', 'two', 'films', 'two', 'thoughts', 'came', 'mind.1', '2', 'films', 'made', 'War', 'condemned', 'racist', 'actually', 'pretty', 'mark', 'films', 'fit', 'well', 'suchearlier', 'similar', 'themed', 'films', 'CHINA', 'Alan', 'Ladd', 'DRAGONSEEDwith', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn.2', 'America', 'films', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'made', 'Hollywood', 'considersany', 'film', 'portraying', 'Non-Whites', 'villainous', 'light', 'be', 'somehowracist', 'thus', 'doing', 'so', 'American', 'artistic', 'community', 'onceagain', 'enablers', 'apologists', 'genocide', 'Chineseand', 'German', 'filmmakers', 'make', 'such', 'films', 'today.I', 'understand', 'Japanese', 'are', 'now', 'making', 'movie', 'revealing', 'theRape', 'Nanking', 'never', 'happened', 'lie', 'wicked', 'Chineseand', 'other', 'foreigners']",N/A
1290224,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B002UOKXNS,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[2, 2]","I wanted to see this after having seen, `City of War' last year which allegedly tells the story of John Rabe, who is acknowledged for having saved thousands of Chinese during what has gone down I history as `The rape of Nanking'. This film aims to tell the true version of events and includes the efforts made by John Rabe and the small international delegation that stayed on to help the Chinese.Director Lu Chuan tells the unrelenting horror story of the six week occupation in an observational way but it is impossible to not become partisan as the Japanese are seen to be little short of murdering monsters. He uses several characters to tell the story and has interestingly included an Imperial Japanese Army soldier who has a guilty conscience. He even feels he is having a relationship with on of the euphemistically titled `comfort girls'. This depiction of a confused and caring Japanese soldier actually brought death threats to Lu and his family as being over sympathetic and it was removed from some mailnland Chinese cinemas, however it was saved by the personal support from Li Changchun, a member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of China.That aside this is unrelenting in its quite often graphic depiction of the murders, beheadings rapes, and mass executions that took place taking the lives of 300,000 Chinese.It is shot entirely in black and white and is actually lit brilliantly to give it a period feel (probably to reflect that these events took place in 1937). However the cinematographic beauty aside, this was a very harrowing and sobering film, which I must confess I found hard to get through. That is not because it runs for 130 mins, but because I found the constant brutality a bit much and I do not consider myself to be a bit soft on such matters. The only film I ever walked out of for gross content was `Salo -or 120 days of Sodom' (I was actually in my own home at the time). Even though this is blisteringly real, beautifully shot and exceptionally well acted, I found it both demanding and moving.As I said above this is not for the faint hearted and accusations of anti Japanese propaganda should be dismissed as this tends towards trying to examine the human spirit in the depths of loss and despair.

1290225,A3AAK33K3BUUTM,B002UOKXNS,trashcanman,"[13, 16]","So once again the god of Asian cinema has shined upon me and delivered something new to my doorstep. While admittedly, I'm often hesitant to embrace the genre of film I refer to as ""soul-scorchers"" since they tend to revel in a combination of realistic atrocity and overwrought sentimentality that I find manipulative and distasteful, I am still of the opinion that one must partake of them from time to time if only to be reminded just what your fellow man is capable of. I found ""City of Life and Death"" to be an effective, yet somehow disconnected chronicling of some of the events of the second World War in Asia. I would in fact, consider this mandatory viewing to those whose knowledge of WWII only reflects the Eurocentric viewpoint we were all taught in school. Europe and America were not the only countries involved in this worldwide atrocity that has bafflingly been referred to in our country as ""the greatest generation"". Apparently, body counts is the way we are keeping score on that. I'm personally glad my generation is lagging a bit. The film covers the Japanese conquest and subsequent tyrannical reign in the Chinese capitol of Nanjing, where the story is told from several viewpoints, all sympathetic, and often opposing.I'm not quite sure what people will make of this one. While it certainly avoids the overt sentimentality of your typical Hollywood stuff, the actors all give strong emotional performances. But the lack of a prominent score removes much of the manipulative elements and the filmmaker simply lets the black-and-white imagery and the trials of the characters speak for themselves only occasionally filling otherwise silent scenes with an unaccompanied piano or violin. At times it feels as though punches are being pulled, but at the same time the director obviously felt strongly about presenting the events in an entirely neutral manner and allowing the viewer to make of it what they will. It almost feels like more of a historical documentary at times in that aspect. The battle that happens early in the film is extremely well put together and very clearly illustrates the events and strategies at play where scenes often fall into chaos and rely on violence and explosions. I was very impressed with the realism. When the Japanese armor arrives, the Chinese have only two options: scatter or surrender. Those who surrender are all penned up like cattle down to the little boy who was only fetching ammo. As they are marched out of their pen, you certainly get a bad feeling, but when you see they are being marched to the sea, my blood ran cold as I tried to imagine what the victims must have felt like knowing the inevitable. Some are buried while still alive after being cut down like wheat by a machine gun scythe, but most are simply left where they lie. Too much trouble to bury all of the roughly 300,000 who were massacred during this ordeal.Now ask yourself this: how do yo know when things literally can not get any worse? How about when a nazi is the voice of reason and compassion? How cruel does an occupying force have to be to make a god-cursed nazi cry? Watch the film and find out. After most of the troops are disposed of, the Japanese army spares no expense brutally hunting down any possible survivors, even barging into hospitals and shooting the wounded in their beds. But it's the abominable practice of rounding up ""comfort women"" that finally makes the sympathetic German overseer of the international ""safe zone"" set up to offer shelter for refugees crack. Mothers, sisters, and daughters all forced to prostitute themselves to the army who slaughtered their friends and family and destroyed their homes. These women literally serviced one soldier after another until they died hoping that their sacrifice would prevent the army from slaughtering the remainder of their people. Now, let it be noted that Japan has denied the existence of these practices. And let me add that only the lowest of the lowest scum would deny an act that has literally thousands of living witnesses. What's that? You say rape and genocide are old news? You want more personal violence? Well how about a Japanese soldier tossing a small child out of a window a few stories off the ground while the parents look on? Something for everybody here.Many of the characters in City of Life and Death are based on actual people and their historical accounts of the events of the Nanking Massacre. One, at least, is still alive to tell the story. I wouldn't get attached to most of the cast, though. There's a whole lot of death in this city and not so much life. Plenty of character development to go around, though. The German, Chinese, and Japanese viewpoints are all presented admirably, heroic sacrifices are made, and one prominent character makes it out to the other side only to decide he cannot live with what he's seen. Powerful stuff all around. There are also some very interesting moments that stand out. I was particularly fond of the Japanese victory parade sequence. The barbaric garishness of these troops dancing in unison through the rubble-filled streets of the city they emptied with their brutality is both a fascinating look at the culture and a black irony that borders on the comedic. The tragedy of a scene where the Japanese try their hand at benevolence by allowing a wagon of condemned men a chance to be rescued by their sobbing family members is almost palpable. The women are told that they may only take one man each, else they will be shot. So if your father and husband are both on the wagon, better make the choice, ladies.City of Life and Death can't exactly be called an entertaining film, but it is a fantastic historical portrayal of some of the horrors of the second World War in Asia. If you were wondering why Japan isn't allowed to keep an army to this day, this film may answer that question for you. Some viewers may feel a bit disconnected from the events due to the film's unusual style, but that's all part of the extremely objective viewpoint fostered throughout by the director, Lu Chuan. You are simply there to observe the trials and tribulations as they happened and are not nudged to shed tears by sappy music or excessively dramatic shots and shoe-horned romance. That is both the film's strong and weak point. If they wished it, it could have been a much more horrific film to shake you to your very soul. But as it is, it is a fairly sterile telling of a few of the atrocities visited upon the people of a single city in China while the world looked the other way. And it does a great job of it. The cast and crew were extremely brave and Chuan suffered quite a bit to get the film made with resistance from both the Chinese people (who objected to the balanced POV), and the Japanese actors he attempted to garner for the soldier roles. Most prominent Japanese actors refused and some of those who accepted reportedly suffered nervous breakdowns on the set after realizing just what their people had done and having to re-enact the deeds. But the fact that neither side seems to be happy with the finished product means the filmmaker did his job and effectively portrayed the reality of the situation and didn't get hung up on emotional exploitation.

1290226,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B002UOKXNS,Turfseer,"[6, 10]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Rating: 3.5 out of 5.0Chuan Lu, the talented director of 'City of Life and Death', was faced with a quandary in attempting to recount the ""Rape of Nanking"", perhaps the single greatest series of atrocities committed by the Japanese occupation force during the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937. Just as the Jewish people always say ""never forget"" when it comes to remembering the Holocaust, the Chinese people also feel compelled to ""never forget"" and recall their own Holocaust. But Mr. Lu can't ignore the fact that the Japanese people of 1937 are not the same people of today, and his compulsion to reconcile the past and the present was perhaps his greatest challenge in writing the screenplay.Ironically, Lu ended up receiving death threats, not from the Japanese but from some Chinese people who felt that he did not extract a sufficient enough ""pound of flesh"" as compensation for those who suffered during the Occupation. I can recall my own grandparents, who had relatives that were killed in the Holocaust, speak ever so harshly of the Germans and wanted nothing to do with any of them--even those born after the War. Because it was an emotional issue, they ignored the Biblical admonition found in Ezekiel 18:20: ""The person who sins will die. The son will not bear the punishment for the father's iniquity"". The same can be said for many Chinese people who are unable to forgive the Japanese, even though rationally it makes no sense that those born after the war are blamed for their parents or grandparents' crimes. While Director Lu's reconciliation strategy is a noble one, I'm not completely convinced the way he went about expressing his attitude of 'forgiveness' toward the Japanese, enhanced the story, strengthening its verisimilitude.Where the film is successful, is in the multitude of indelible images that re-create the horror show that was 1937 Nanking. The images from the film's opening sequence are shattering as they suggest an escalating atmosphere of terror that affected both the Chinese civilian and military population . One image that really sticks in my mind are the Chinese soldiers trying to escape the walled city and are unsuccessfully held back by their commanders. For those soldiers who stayed behind, they're shown to be courageous as they fight back against an overwhelmingly superior force. When they are finally defeated and surrender, the brutal Japanese soldiers take no prisoners. Some are herded into a warehouse with the doors locked shut and then the building is set on fire. Others are marched to the ocean and almost all are machine-gunned to death. Before they're murdered, the soldiers shout ""Long live China"" and again show their courage against their brutal occupiers.Worse is what happens to the civilian population, especially the Chinese women. The Japanese force the leaders in the 'Safety Zone' (an area where refugees were supposedly protected by an agreement with international observers) to select 100 women to serve as prostitutes over a period of three weeks for the Japanese soldiers. The women are strapped to beds and are raped continuously through the day and night. Some fail to survive the ordeal and who can forget the scene where the soldiers carry out the nude corpses in a wheelbarrow? The strategies of the Japanese troops recall the sadism of their Nazi counterparts in the book & film, 'Sophies Choice'. You'll recall that Sophie was forced to select one of her children over another by the Nazis. In Nanking, the Japanese play their own little sadistic game--they lead families to believe that their loved ones will be let go--but then order the families to choose only one!Of all the characters here, Mr. Tang is the most compelling. Tang was John Rabe's interpreter and assistant. When Rabe informs him that he's being recalled back to Germany, Tang makes a pact with the devil by informing the Japanese commanders that there might be Chinese soldiers hiding out in the safety zone; he does this to obtain a safe conduct pass in order to save his family. This admission creates the pretext for the occupiers to violate the agreement and invade the safety zone in order to commit more atrocities. Tang soon learns that the Japanese had no intention of honoring their side of the bargain and a Japanese soldier ends up throwing Tang's daughter out the window. In an act of redemption, Tang trades places with a soldier and remains behind as his wife escapes when she leaves Nanking with John Rabe.Lu is unsuccessful when he attempts to throw a bone to the Japanese people of today by creating the unconvincing character of Kadokawa. According to Lu, he based Kadokawa's character on diaries he read of Japanese soldiers who were in Nanking during the massacres. Although there may have been a few soldiers who were repulsed by what they saw, the vast majority were more like Ida, Kadokawa's sadistic direct superior. Lu has trouble fleshing out his Kadokawa character--he shows his sensitive side to a Japanese 'comfort girl' who he claims that one day she'll be his wife. And later, Kadokawa shoots Miss Jiang as a mercy killing and then does himself in, as he is unable to cope with his guilt. But it's really not enough--Kadokawa is an anachronistic presence, designed to suggest that Japanese people weren't that bad, even back then. But in 1937, the mindset of the average Japanese person, was decidedly quite fanatical.What Lu merely needed to do was put a disclaimer at the beginning of the film, noting that Japan transformed itself after the War and that the son should not pay for the iniquity of the father. Without Kadokawa (or perhaps having him as a greatly reduced presence), 'City' would have been much more true to life and there would have been no misunderstanding Lu was blaming the Japanese born after WW II, who bear no responsibility for the bloody scenes that happened so long ago.",3,Powerful chronicle of the 'Rape of Nanking' compromised by view through an anachronistic lens,1306281600,"05

1290227,A1LMZB5FVKBKPB,B002UOKXNS,"Walter W. Ko ""Walter Ko""","[6, 7]","This is a docu-drama of a Chinese soldier, a Japanese soldier, a Chinese teacher, Nazi businessman Rabe and his Chinese secretary in the 1937 Rape of Nanking, China.Director Lu used montage on Japanese atrocities of massacre in stabbing, burying alive, burning, machine-gun mowing, head chopping with mountains of corpses, a horror scene of hell.  It was impossible to condense the large scale of over six weeks slaughters and raping of innocent Chinese people in this film.  However, he successfully chilled viewers the cold-blood horror.Of significance was his choice of emphasize - the close-up shot the Chinese soldier of endurance and defiant; the sun beam through the window on the raised hand in volunteering to be the first ""comfort woman""; and the challenge eye-sight and words ""shoot me"" from the teacher who saved six male strangers as relatives by changing six sets of clothes.In the film the non-historical Japanese victory drum dance and the memorial service for the fallen soldiers in China illustrated the Bushido loyalty to the Emperor.  Such blind faith carried over even after the unconditional surrender in 1945 with government officials including Prime Minister make frequent tribute visits to Tokyo Yasukuni Shrine where housed the executed war criminals of Tokyo Trial.The recent book The Undaunted Women of Nanking included side by side the diaries of Minnie Vautrin and Tsen Shui-fang, validating the Japanese war crimes.  The Japanese soldier, Kadokawa in the film looked more like American than Japanese in outfit; the gun is not the typical German Mauser.  At the end of film, he released the two Chinese after personal reflection and killed himself, still in his blind loyalty to the Emperor system.This film is a story of black of white, life and death, yin and yan, fact and fiction, strong and weak, good and evil, humanity and violence.  To the victims and survivors, the film is a memorial.  To young people, it is a review of history to fight for humanity and justice.  To foreigners, it illustrates the contribution of endurance and courage of Chinese people in engaging Japanese invaders in China mainland so that Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan would not be able to join forces in Middle East to conquer the world. Moreover, is it a communist exploitation of nationalism to stage anti-Japanese propaganda as always alleged by Western media?  To the Japanese, it sugar-coated the Japanese atrocities on an imaginary Imperial solder with humanity and mercy.  This film challenges all to check why the perpetrators still keep on whitewashing, distorting and even denying the Rape of Nanking.  Will they follow soldier Kadokawa to Nanking for atonement and contrition?The Undaunted Women of Nanking: The Wartime Diaries of Minnie Vautrin and Tsen Shui-fang",5,Rape of Nanking in film and history,1292716800,"12 19, 2010",2010,2790,"['docu-drama', 'Chinese', 'soldier', 'Japanese', 'soldier', 'Chinese', 'teacher', 'Nazi', 'businessman', 'Rabe', 'Chinese', 'secretary', '1937', 'Rape', 'Nanking', 'China.Director', 'Lu', 'used', 'montage', 'Japanese', 'atrocities', 'massacre', 'stabbing', 'burying', 'alive', 'burning', 'machine-gun', 'mowing', 'head', 'chopping', 'mountains', 'corpses', 'horror', 'scene', 'hell', 'was', 'impossible', 'condense', 'large', 'scale', 'six', 'weeks', 'slaughters', 'raping', 'innocent', 'Chinese', 'people', 'film', 'However', 'successfully', 'chilled', 'viewers', 'cold-blood', 'horror.Of', 'significance', 'was', 'choice', 'emphasize', 'close-up', 'shot', 'Chinese', 'soldier', 'endurance', 'defiant', 'sun', 'beam', 'window', 'raised', 'hand', 'volunteering', 'be', 'first', 'comfort', 'woman', 'challenge', 'eye-sight', 'words', 'shoot', 'teacher', 'who', 'saved', 'six', 'male', 'strangers', 'relatives', 'changing', 'six', 'sets', 'clothes.In', 'film', 'non-historical', 'Japanese', 'victory', 'drum', 'dance', 'memorial', 'service', 'fallen', 'soldiers', 'China', 'illustrated', 'Bushido', 'loyalty', 'Emperor', 'Such', 'faith', 'carried', 'even', 'unconditional', 'surrender', '1945', 'government', 'officials', 'including', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'make', 'frequent', 'tribute', 'visits', 'Tokyo', 'Yasukuni', 'Shrine', 'where', 'housed', 'executed', 'war', 'criminals', 'Tokyo', 'Trial.The', 'recent', 'book', 'Undaunted', 'Women', 'Nanking', 'included', 'side', 'side', 'diaries', 'Minnie', 'Vautrin', 'Tsen', 'Shui-fang', 'validating', 'Japanese', 'war', 'crimes', 'Japanese', 'soldier', 'Kadokawa', 'film', 'looked', 'more', 'American', 'Japanese', 'outfit', 'gun', 'not', 'typical', 'German', 'Mauser', 'end', 'film', 'released', 'two', 'Chinese', 'personal', 'reflection', 'killed', 'still', 'blind', 'loyalty', 'Emperor', 'system.This', 'film', 'story', 'black', 'white', 'life', 'death', 'yin', 'yan', 'fact', 'fiction', 'strong', 'weak', 'good', 'evil', 'humanity', 'violence', 'victims', 'survivors', 'film', 'memorial', 'young', 'people', 'review', 'history', 'fight', 'humanity', 'justice', 'foreigners', 'contribution', 'endurance', 'courage', 'Chinese', 'people', 'engaging', 'Japanese', 'invaders', 'China', 'mainland', 'so', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'Imperial', 'Japan', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'join', 'forces', 'Middle', 'East', 'conquer', 'world', 'Moreover', 'communist', 'exploitation', 'nationalism', 'stage', 'anti-Japanese', 'propaganda', 'always', 'alleged', 'Western', 'media', 'Japanese', 'sugar-coated', 'Japanese', 'atrocities', 'imaginary', 'Imperial', 'solder', 'humanity', 'mercy', 'film', 'check', 'why', 'perpetrators', 'still', 'keep', 'whitewashing', 'distorting', 'even', 'denying', 'Rape', 'Nanking', 'Will', 'follow', 'soldier', 'Kadokawa', 'Nanking', 'atonement', 'contrition', 'Undaunted', 'Women', 'Nanking', 'Wartime', 'Diaries', 'Minnie', 'Vautrin', 'Tsen', 'Shui-fang']",N/A
