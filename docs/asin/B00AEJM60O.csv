It would be strengthened by more complex layers of plot regarding the jinxed town, the condemned loony bin, and how they both tie-in to Nathan's disappearance. The pacing--too fast in certain places, too slow in others--also works against this film. Nevertheless, there are some interesting nuances, mostly realistic but with slight hints of the supernatural.

I can only imagine that they come from 1. horror fans who were expecting something completely different 2. those in some way against actors/creators/others involved in the movie's making.  It was actually a decent suspense/thriller (my fave type of movie)-the only bad thing is, once you've seen this type of film it doesn't usually warrant a second viewing bc the secret is out.  Was not terribly complicated, but it didn't give everything away, in other words kept the suspense up throughout, whcih is what the best suspense films do.  Beautiful cinematography, definitely didn't look B-movie-ish to me.  Although I miss Val in his heydey (and his heydey looks), I enjoy checking out his newer flicks as well.SPOILER ALERT: Although I never understood a couple things: 1. Just how did an anti-social psychopath like the dad manage to abduct his son in about a ten-minute maximum timeframe from a town gas station without any outside help, when the boy lived in a different town to begin with...  and  2. Why did he light on fire so easily when the girl threw the matches on him, as if he had gasoline all over him?  and 3.  How did the girl survive the electic shocks without any brain damage or being unconsious?One mesage I took from Riddle was that not everyone is as bad as they seem--since we are distrustful of all the characters through the movie, it is a relief to find out the truth in the end.

I have set up a pretty big &#34;watchlist&#34; on Amazon Prime just by browsing through the Prime movie list and when I feel like watching a movie I just go there and pick one.  Some of these movies are those ones I've never heard and I like that because I know nothing about the movie (no previous hype or trailers) and consequently no expectations.  So unless the movie is totally terrible, it provides an acceptable level of entertainment.  This is one of those movies.  I would not have paid to see it, but for what I do, it was okay.  The chubby Val Kilmer is in it along with a bunch of sorta unknowns.  It is a mystery that sort of turns a tad horror-ish in the last quarter, but the acting and production was not bad.  LIke I say..I would give it an &#34;ok&#34; and it entertained me.",3,Just watchin' some of my free movies,1365811200,"04 13, 2013",2013,815,"['movie', 'was', 'okay', 'have', 'set', 'up', 'pretty', 'big', '34', 'watchlist', '34', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'just', 'browsing', 'Prime', 'movie', 'list', 'when', 'feel', 'watching', 'movie', 'just', 'go', 'there', 'pick', 'one', 'movies', 'are', 'ones', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'like', 'know', 'nothing', 'movie', 'previous', 'hype', 'trailers', 'consequently', 'expectations', 'So', 'movie', 'totally', 'terrible', 'acceptable', 'level', 'entertainment', 'one', 'movies', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'paid', 'see', 'what', 'do', 'was', 'okay', 'chubby', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'bunch', 'sorta', 'unknowns', 'mystery', 'sort', 'tad', 'horror-ish', 'last', 'quarter', 'acting', 'production', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'say..I', 'would', 'give', '34', '34', 'entertained']",Riddle

It's a good movie to enjoy along with some buttered popcorn.  I've seen a check of alot worse on this website.  I guess I can compare it to ""The Gate"".
