I wish I had known that before I bought it.  It was like a B-movie in America.  If you aren't expecting much, this is the film to watch.  The best thing about the film is the cover.

1666907,A1NIGUK4M2ST8,B00EDM2RI4,mk,"[3, 3]","This moderately budgeted Norwegian film gives kids a mystical tale with lots of fantasy, some cute creatures, and for the adults, lots of  incredible vistas and castles.2012 release and dubbed in English, the story starts with a king's daughter, Golden Hair,  who vanishes in the forest under a curse.  Her father has 10 years to break the curse by finding the legendary Christmas Star, or the daughter will be lost forever.  Enter the heroine, Sonya, a poor, street urchin who decides to take on the  journey.  She meets many incredible beings and helpers, e.g., tiny gnomes, a talking bear, North Wind, Father Christmas; however, evil forces, a raven witch, attempt to stop her.Our kids were glued to this intense G rated story, geared towards children's love of magic and fantasy. I found most of the movie very well made; although, as an adult, not always holding my interest.  The dubbing doesn't quite match up, hard to get English to pace with that Norwegian, but it's alright(nothing like those old kung-fu movies we used to laugh over).  Also, being of Norwegian heritage, I wished they would have included the Norwegian version with subtitles.A fairly short film, it runs about 73 minutes, and there are really no extras.  Mildly stressful situations, but our youngsters(7 & 10) always felt things would work out and really enjoyed this film.  They wanted more of the bear.",4,Magical Scenery- Kids love the Story,1385164800,"11 23, 2013",2013,1383,"['moderately', 'budgeted', 'Norwegian', 'film', 'kids', 'mystical', 'tale', 'lots', 'fantasy', 'cute', 'creatures', 'adults', 'lots', 'incredible', 'vistas', 'castles.2012', 'release', 'dubbed', 'English', 'story', 'king', 'daughter', 'Golden', 'Hair', 'who', 'forest', 'curse', 'father', '10', 'years', 'break', 'curse', 'finding', 'legendary', 'Christmas', 'Star', 'daughter', 'will', 'be', 'lost', 'forever', 'Enter', 'heroine', 'Sonya', 'poor', 'street', 'urchin', 'who', 'take', 'journey', 'many', 'incredible', 'beings', 'helpers', 'e.g.', 'tiny', 'gnomes', 'talking', 'bear', 'North', 'Wind', 'Father', 'Christmas', 'however', 'evil', 'forces', 'raven', 'witch', 'attempt', 'stop', 'her.Our', 'kids', 'were', 'glued', 'intense', 'G', 'rated', 'story', 'geared', 'children', 'love', 'magic', 'fantasy', 'found', 'most', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'adult', 'not', 'always', 'holding', 'interest', 'dubbing', ""n't"", 'quite', 'match', 'up', 'hard', 'get', 'English', 'pace', 'Norwegian', 'alright', 'nothing', 'old', 'kung-fu', 'movies', 'used', 'Also', 'being', 'Norwegian', 'heritage', 'wished', 'would', 'have', 'included', 'Norwegian', 'version', 'subtitles.A', 'fairly', 'short', 'film', '73', 'minutes', 'are', 'really', 'extras', 'Mildly', 'stressful', 'situations', 'youngsters', '7', '10', 'always', 'felt', 'things', 'would', 'work', 'out', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'wanted', 'more', 'bear']",Journey to the Christmas Star
1666908,A288ODIXLFVGC6,B00EDM2RI4,P. Healy,"[3, 3]","I don't understand the low ratings by some reviewers. This is a ""fantasy"" movie intended for children and the young at heart. It promotes wholesome family values which are obviously politically incorrect for some people. Themes include honesty, generosity, personal-sacrifice, faith, hope and a steadfast spirit. This is the type of movie that American filmmakers have long forgotten how to make. Yes, it's a foreign (Norwegian) production, filmed in Norway and the Czech Republic. The dubbing is very well done and does not distract from the film. The young actress, Vilde Marie Zeiner, who plays Sonja, is a natural who never overacts, and is a cute little kid. There is a good amount of Norwegian cultural elements throughout which I found educational as well as entertaining - the scenes with the Gnomes are a prime example. The music by the Bratislava Symphony Orchestra is outstanding!Don't hesitate to get this film. It's the type of Christmas movie that is heartwarming anytime of the year!

1666909,A2CMNPQL1C5JSQ,B00EDM2RI4,Richard Cory,"[0, 0]","This xmas movie is best for winter viewing even though it has St. Nick and uses the words Christmas often (hence the title!).  It has greater potential than it delivers in terms of the way the director uses emotion for the girl and her father (the king).  The discovery of long-lost yet reunited people is a bit weak and underplayed.  It has awesome filmography/scenes and very endearing qualities overall. In conclusion, it is well worth seeing!",4,Awesome Movie!,1396656000,"04 5, 2014",2014,446,"['xmas', 'movie', 'best', 'winter', 'viewing', 'even', 'St.', 'Nick', 'words', 'Christmas', 'often', 'hence', 'title', 'greater', 'potential', 'terms', 'way', 'director', 'emotion', 'girl', 'father', 'king', 'discovery', 'long-lost', 'yet', 'reunited', 'people', 'bit', 'weak', 'underplayed', 'awesome', 'filmography/scenes', 'very', 'endearing', 'qualities', 'overall', 'conclusion', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing']",Journey to the Christmas Star

It looks good.The illustrations for the prologue were great...but that's about all I liked of the movie.The acting (minus the main witch) was bad. I think of it as a High school play: you can tell who's got talent and who doesn't. The villain was very over-the-top and I found myself wincing whenever he came on screen or laughing out right at his temper tantrums because they were so stupid.The bear was very fake in film. They put a real bear on the cover.The voice acting did have emotion, but again, the bad lip-sync threw me off. I couldn't enjoy it.If they could get a new script and make it a USA film, I'd watch it to give it another chance, but until they do, no.",2,It stinks.,1384732800,"11 18, 2013",2013,852,"['had', 'great', 'potential', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'when', 'film', 'badly', 'lip-synced', 'magic.The', 'packaging', 'was', 'great', 'back', 'DVD', 'sum-up', 'pulls', 'good.The', 'illustrations', 'prologue', 'were', 'great', 'liked', 'movie.The', 'acting', 'main', 'witch', 'was', 'bad', 'think', 'High', 'school', 'play', 'can', 'tell', 'who', 'got', 'talent', 'who', ""n't"", 'villain', 'was', 'very', 'over-the-top', 'found', 'wincing', 'whenever', 'came', 'screen', 'laughing', 'out', 'right', 'temper', 'tantrums', 'were', 'so', 'stupid.The', 'bear', 'was', 'very', 'fake', 'film', 'put', 'real', 'bear', 'cover.The', 'voice', 'acting', 'did', 'have', 'emotion', 'again', 'bad', 'lip-sync', 'could', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'it.If', 'could', 'get', 'new', 'script', 'make', 'USA', 'film', ""'d"", 'watch', 'give', 'chance', 'do']",Journey to the Christmas Star
