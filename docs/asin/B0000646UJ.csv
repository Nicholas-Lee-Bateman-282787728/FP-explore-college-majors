I've seen it subsequently in VHS format and was decidedly disappointed in the quality. However, this DVD version is as crisp as the original theatrical release, and the audio remains excellent. The entire quality of this version is really commendable. It's impossible to do justice to Hitler's career in two and half hours, but Fest's film remains the standard by which other Fuehrer documentaries must be judged. To its credit, the film focuses on Hitler's early rise to power, and there's great film from the 1927-1932 era. The period of 1933-39 is also strong, though the WWII years as a little hurried. A weakness is that few of Hitler's personal relationships are exlored, either with his various girlfriends or with the Nazi hierarchy.There has been more early film of Hitler unearthed since this film was released, but they include an abundance of rare material that is not found elsewhere. The background music is not grating and the narrator is pleasing. There are also very few factual errors contained in this film.

Without embellishment and almost feverish preoccupation with the pomp and ceremonies of Nazism; this might have been a much better analysis.  It seems to idolize Der Fuhrer without a deeper explication of the mystical aspects of Hitler's SS and inner circle of adherents.  Without that the enigma of Hitler cannot be understood and perhaps even today those who detail the more obvious facts of his rise do not themselves understand the diabolical nuances of that belief system.  There was no mention of the special archaeological searches and digs conducted by Reich scientists.  Nor did it explain his theory of Aryan Supremacy based on Sumerian culture.  Neither it cover the search for explanations about who engineered Indus cultures.,3,More Propaganda,1394668800,"03 13, 2014",2014,856,"['would', 'seem', 'producers', 'doc', 'wrote', 'mostly', 'positives', 'not', 'dwell', 'negatives', 'rule', 'embellishment', 'almost', 'feverish', 'preoccupation', 'pomp', 'ceremonies', 'Nazism', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'analysis', 'idolize', 'Der', 'Fuhrer', 'deeper', 'explication', 'mystical', 'aspects', 'Hitler', 'SS', 'inner', 'circle', 'adherents', 'enigma', 'Hitler', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'understood', 'perhaps', 'even', 'today', 'who', 'detail', 'more', 'obvious', 'facts', 'rise', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'diabolical', 'nuances', 'belief', 'system', 'was', 'mention', 'special', 'archaeological', 'searches', 'digs', 'conducted', 'Reich', 'scientists', 'did', 'explain', 'theory', 'Aryan', 'Supremacy', 'based', 'Sumerian', 'culture', 'search', 'explanations', 'who', 'engineered', 'Indus', 'cultures']",N/A

It's a good way to see how Hitler gradually came to power, the influences that shaped his warped world-view and then how he completely blew the whole thing by trying to grab all of Europe in a matter of a few years.... crazy. What's most startling to ponder after seeing this is to think how a whole population could be so blind to this madness and whipped up into a frenzy of allegiance to this guy in the name of national pride.

The original footage includes film and photos recorded at Hitler's request. I would choose to disagree that the narrative is 'pathetic.' It is well presented and the information is reasonably accurate. Remember that the narration is intended to emphasize the prevailing attitudes during this timeline. The overview is a psychological profile of the multifaceted traits that offer an explanation of who Hitler was and what he accomplished.  It is easy to follow and well organized. Hitler's own study of the footage offers an insight to his use of words and mannerisms combined for maximum effect on those in his audience.  The Teutonic myth of Aryan supremacy and it's origins is addressed. Without being boring or tedious, this presents information and original footage that isn't usually presented in documentaries.

Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","This comprehensive documentary (it's 151 minutes) was created in 1977 and yet it is still one of the better pieces about Hitler specifically.  It's old school film making, a bit dry in presentation, but nevertheless effective at covering the different stages of Hitler's life.  Although portions can seem too simplistic and others rather slanted, it's hard to deny the overall impact that the film (with its effective use of archival footage) creates.  It basically breaks Hitler's career into three distinct stages which can be watched independently.  There is (1889-1933) his early years to his ascendency to Prime Minister, (1933-1939) his rule of Germany until the outbreak of WWII, and (1939-1945) the war until his death.  As this documentary is now 35 years old, it may not be as polished as more contemporary documentaries and the subject matter has been explored at length since then but, for its time, it was absolutely revelatory.
