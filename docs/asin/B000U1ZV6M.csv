Very patriotic and to some extent similar in style they often represent fine examples of the movie making art. Particularly worth mention here is &#34;They were Expendable&#34; a good story with a fine cast and well developed human relationship themes as well as exciting and convincing action scenes. That this film was made by John Ford would raise your expectations and the film certainly delivers. Nicholas Ray, Edward Dmytryk and George Waggner are the other directors and they do not disappoint. &#34;Operation Pacific&#34; is another worth mention being perhaps, in my opinion, second to the &#34;Enemy Below&#34; the best submarine film of WW 2.

Always fascinated by war treatment through ""based on"" movie stories of actual theatres of conflict and combat.  (I'm very curious about the 4th, Pacific Command, which I haven't seen but would like to.)As one reviewer correctly states, these are not typical war-time ""flag wavers"" of the kind featuring Wayne (Flying Tigers, 1942; The Fighting Seabees, 1944) and other favourite stars. They Were Expendable and Back to Bataan were released just as WWII was ending (changing events in the Philippines meant script rewrites as RKO shot Bataan) and the other two were made in 1951, years after the war, but which retain that ol' red-white-and blue flavor. Howcum, I wondered? Wasn't the U.S. eager to leave that awful experience behind and embrace the new, shiny upwardly-mobile world of the 1950s?  Well, no.  On one level, it couldn't afford to: `Japs' had been replaced by a new enemy--Chinese Communists; America (along with dozens of other countries) was once again off on another rescue mission. Just substitute South Korea for the Philippines.So, no wonder Hollywood was re-creating that (safe) war again eager to show, as reviewers here put it,  ""what the USA tho't of itself"" and ""the dedication, perseverance, sacrifice, and bravery of our United States armed forces"" (Whew!!)  The USA was at war again, folks! Just like it was LBJ's Vietnam years, when 1965's In Harm's Way paired the Duke again with his Operation Pacific co-star, the wonderful Patricia Neal--again a nurse!--in another navel picture that acted as a ""safe"" wartime morale-booster.)That's interesting.But the movies themselves?  Not so much, today. (which makes over 90 reviews a fascinating fact in itself!) Of the 3 that I've seen, Expendable is the most interesting, because of its dour, meditative feeling. But a lot of doom-and-gloom philosophy talk before the machine guns stutter and the artillery opens up make for a slow ""action"" pic.All these movies are crippled by their technology, which reduced many action sequences to pastiches of obvious sound-stage heroics, grainy real-life combat footage and (especially with In Harm's Way) primitive miniature work. All of which tends to make them, for me, at least, uninvolving film relics; interesting curiosities, but not very compelling.For ""compelling"" takes on this theatre of war, purchase Clint Eastwood's Flags of Our Fathers, or Tom Hanks' HBO series, The Pacific.",2,"""HISTORY"" FILM RELICS",1384905600,"11 20, 2013",2013,2465,"['have', 'watched', '3', '4', 'movies', 'here', 'other', 'post-war', 'times', 'Always', 'fascinated', 'war', 'treatment', 'based', 'movie', 'stories', 'actual', 'theatres', 'conflict', 'combat', ""'m"", 'very', 'curious', '4th', 'Pacific', 'Command', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'would', 'like', 'one', 'reviewer', 'correctly', 'are', 'not', 'typical', 'war-time', 'flag', 'wavers', 'kind', 'featuring', 'Wayne', 'Flying', 'Tigers', '1942', 'Fighting', 'Seabees', '1944', 'other', 'favourite', 'stars', 'Were', 'Expendable', 'Back', 'Bataan', 'were', 'released', 'just', 'WWII', 'was', 'ending', 'changing', 'events', 'Philippines', 'meant', 'script', 'rewrites', 'RKO', 'shot', 'Bataan', 'other', 'two', 'were', 'made', '1951', 'years', 'war', 'retain', 'ol', 'red-white-and', 'blue', 'flavor', 'Howcum', 'wondered', 'Was', ""n't"", 'U.S.', 'eager', 'leave', 'awful', 'experience', 'embrace', 'new', 'shiny', 'upwardly-mobile', 'world', '1950s', 'Well', 'one', 'level', 'could', ""n't"", 'afford', 'Japs', 'had', 'been', 'replaced', 'new', 'enemy', 'Chinese', 'Communists', 'America', 'dozens', 'other', 'countries', 'was', 'once', 'again', 'off', 'rescue', 'mission', 'Just', 'substitute', 'South', 'Korea', 'Philippines.So', 'wonder', 'Hollywood', 'was', 're-creating', 'safe', 'war', 'again', 'eager', 'show', 'reviewers', 'here', 'put', 'what', 'USA', ""tho't"", 'dedication', 'perseverance', 'sacrifice', 'bravery', 'United', 'States', 'armed', 'forces', 'Whew', 'USA', 'was', 'war', 'again', 'folks', 'Just', 'was', 'LBJ', 'Vietnam', 'years', 'when', '1965', 'Harm', 'Way', 'paired', 'Duke', 'again', 'Operation', 'Pacific', 'co-star', 'wonderful', 'Patricia', 'Neal', 'again', 'nurse', 'navel', 'picture', 'acted', 'safe', 'wartime', 'morale-booster', 'interesting.But', 'movies', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'today', '90', 'reviews', 'fascinating', 'fact', '3', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Expendable', 'most', 'interesting', 'dour', 'meditative', 'feeling', 'lot', 'doom-and-gloom', 'philosophy', 'talk', 'machine', 'stutter', 'artillery', 'up', 'make', 'slow', 'action', 'movies', 'are', 'crippled', 'technology', 'reduced', 'many', 'action', 'sequences', 'pastiches', 'obvious', 'sound-stage', 'heroics', 'grainy', 'real-life', 'combat', 'footage', 'especially', 'Harm', 'Way', 'primitive', 'miniature', 'work', 'make', 'least', 'uninvolving', 'film', 'relics', 'interesting', 'curiosities', 'not', 'very', 'compelling.For', 'compelling', 'theatre', 'war', 'purchase', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Flags', 'Fathers', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'HBO', 'series', 'Pacific']","4 Film Favorites: John Wayne (Back to Bataan, Flying Leathernecks, Operation Pacific, They Were Expendable)"

Excellent movie. 5 stars. If you like true PT boat action read about JFK and crew in PT 109( read my review...5 stars).Operation Pacific in B/W ( my favorite of this 4 movie set with John Wayne and Patricia Neal is a riveting battling submarine story with Patricia Neal playing John Wayne's ( the XO then skipper of the Thunderfish sub) ex wife. Lots of great naval  battle action and a love story. 5 starsFlying Leathernecks in color is about a Marine fighter squadron with John Wayne in charge of the squadron and Robert Ryan as the XO. Lots of fighter fight scenes, attacks on ships, and supporting ground troops. 5 starsBack to Bataan in B/W was in my opinion the most historical showing the collapse of Bataan and the capture of 70,000 US troops. We see the Filipino resistance fighters and their hardships attacking superior Japanese forces and attacking and trying to hold Japanese held positions until General MacArthur and his troops can gather strength and come back and liberate the Philippine nation. Very well done. Here is a DVD set I am proud to show my teenage daughters showing the hardships the military went through defeating the Japanese in WW2. Much of these actions are no longer told in Public schools and INMO it is important to show the younger generation the men and women in WW2 that died  so the  US could remain free and the Philippine people could be liberated. A great movie with historical significance and lots of battle action  staring John Wayne as a Marine Colonel and Anthony Quinn as a Filipino Captain. 5 stars.I can't say anything bad about this 2 DVD 4 film DVD collection.
