It was pretty funny and I am surprised that we had not heard of it before we found it at our local library. There was a lot of toilet humor, my husband laughed - I didn't but other than that it was a decent date night for us.The one thing I loved it the simplicity of the comedy. It was very reminiscent of 80's or early 90's movies where the actor makes something funny and things do not have to be an elaborately set up mess to make things humorous. This movie was very similar to &#34;Splash&#34; the humor and comedy felt the same while I was watching.I did dislike the amount of dirty/first grade humor about butts ect. . .. I could have done without this, however the man in my life found it funny. All in all we were surprised by this movie - we laughed out loud and thought it was much better than it was reviewed. I probably would not watch it again but it made our date night fun!I recommend this movie for families with older children or couples that just would like a quick laugh.",4,"Funny, A bit of toilet humor, Okay Movie",1394064000,"03 6, 2014",2014,1051,"['liked', '34', 'Meet', 'Dave', '34', 'more', 'thought', 'would', 'was', 'pretty', 'funny', 'am', 'surprised', 'had', 'not', 'heard', 'found', 'local', 'library', 'was', 'lot', 'toilet', 'humor', 'husband', 'laughed', 'did', ""n't"", 'other', 'was', 'decent', 'date', 'night', 'us.The', 'one', 'thing', 'loved', 'simplicity', 'comedy', 'was', 'very', 'reminiscent', '80', 'early', '90', 'movies', 'where', 'actor', 'something', 'funny', 'things', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'be', 'elaborately', 'set', 'up', 'mess', 'make', 'things', 'humorous', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'similar', '34', 'Splash', '34', 'humor', 'comedy', 'felt', 'same', 'was', 'watching.I', 'did', 'dislike', 'amount', 'dirty/first', 'grade', 'humor', 'butts', 'ect', '..', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'however', 'man', 'life', 'found', 'funny', 'were', 'surprised', 'movie', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'thought', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'was', 'reviewed', 'probably', 'would', 'not', 'watch', 'again', 'made', 'date', 'night', 'fun', 'recommend', 'movie', 'families', 'older', 'children', 'couples', 'just', 'would', 'like', 'quick', 'laugh']",Meet Dave

1188051,A2582KMXLK2P06,B001F7Q4IE,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","I swear Eddie Murphy is one of the most underrated comedians ever.  This is because, even though he's popular, he never gets the appreciation or recognition he deserves.  It's like we've reached a point where we just expect him to be funny, and we KNOW he'll be funny, but rarely do people take the time to really appreciate his style and realize just how good his films normally are.Meet Dave is about Eddie Murphy's character portraying an alien and invading earth.  Actually, that's not quite right.  You see, what you witness is Eddie Murphy portraying an alien towards the people of earth, all the while trying extremely hard NOT to blow his cover so people don't find out what's really going on with him.But -as confusing as this is to explain and understand- there's actually a little Eddie Murphy inside the robot/alien version of a much bigger Eddie Murphy.  Yes, there's NO other way for me to explain it!  Basically, there's two Eddie Murphy's- a little one and a big one.All the people of earth believe Eddie Murphy is a strange man who's just out of touch with reality, but they don't suspect that he's actually an alien.  When he encounters a single mom and her son, this is when the humor really kicks in.Some of my favorite segments include:- When Eddie Murphy kicks a cat assuming he's a much larger animal.- When Eddie beats eggs in a bowl in record setting time!- When Eddie's character picks up and turns upside down a school bully in order to shake out an important rock for his alien needs (you'll understand what this means when you watch the storyline).- When his cover is almost blown and the little people living inside of him are *almost* revealed during a dance date (you'll understand what this means when you see the film).- When he goes crazy in a police station and blows up walls with a blue cannon coming out of his arm.- Just the way he'd frequently say things in a technical serious way such as ""Did you see the sports competition last night?"" to little kids, and then the kids would question him and call him weird.- In fact, the entire school segment was funny because the kids would constantly say really rude things to him.- When his character stuffed down hot dogs like they were nothing during an eating competition.- When Eddie's character believed a stuffed animal he was strangling (that he won as a result of the hot dog competition) was actually an alien from another planet!- Just the fact that Eddie Murphy's alien character tried hard to understand the people of earth and their many confusing problems.Meet Dave is just an all-around terrific comedy.  I highly recommend it to not only Eddie Murphy fans, but to anyone who loves a well-made consistently funny comedy.",5,eddie murphy does it again,1286409600,"10 7, 2010",2010,2718,"['swear', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'one', 'most', 'underrated', 'comedians', 'ever', 'even', 'popular', 'never', 'appreciation', 'recognition', ""'ve"", 'reached', 'point', 'where', 'just', 'expect', 'be', 'funny', 'KNOW', ""'ll"", 'be', 'funny', 'rarely', 'do', 'people', 'take', 'time', 'really', 'appreciate', 'style', 'realize', 'just', 'how', 'good', 'films', 'normally', 'are.Meet', 'Dave', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'character', 'portraying', 'alien', 'invading', 'earth', 'Actually', 'not', 'quite', 'right', 'see', 'what', 'witness', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'portraying', 'alien', 'people', 'earth', 'while', 'trying', 'extremely', 'hard', 'NOT', 'blow', 'cover', 'so', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'out', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'him.But', '-as', 'confusing', 'explain', 'understand-', 'actually', 'little', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'robot/alien', 'version', 'much', 'bigger', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'Yes', 'other', 'way', 'explain', 'Basically', 'two', 'Eddie', ""Murphy's-"", 'little', 'one', 'big', 'one.All', 'people', 'earth', 'believe', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'strange', 'man', 'who', 'just', 'touch', 'reality', 'do', ""n't"", 'suspect', 'actually', 'alien', 'When', 'single', 'mom', 'son', 'when', 'humor', 'really', 'in.Some', 'favorite', 'segments', 'include', 'When', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'cat', 'assuming', 'much', 'larger', 'animal.-', 'When', 'Eddie', 'eggs', 'bowl', 'record', 'setting', 'time', 'When', 'Eddie', 'character', 'up', 'upside', 'down', 'school', 'bully', 'order', 'shake', 'out', 'important', 'rock', 'alien', 'needs', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'what', 'when', 'watch', 'storyline', '.-', 'When', 'cover', 'almost', 'blown', 'little', 'people', 'living', 'are', '*almost*', 'revealed', 'dance', 'date', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'what', 'when', 'see', 'film', '.-', 'When', 'crazy', 'police', 'station', 'up', 'walls', 'blue', 'cannon', 'coming', 'arm.-', 'Just', 'way', ""'d"", 'frequently', 'say', 'things', 'technical', 'serious', 'way', 'such', 'Did', 'see', 'sports', 'competition', 'last', 'night', 'little', 'kids', 'then', 'kids', 'would', 'question', 'call', 'weird.-', 'fact', 'entire', 'school', 'segment', 'was', 'funny', 'kids', 'would', 'constantly', 'say', 'really', 'rude', 'things', 'him.-', 'When', 'character', 'stuffed', 'down', 'hot', 'dogs', 'were', 'nothing', 'eating', 'competition.-', 'When', 'Eddie', 'character', 'believed', 'stuffed', 'animal', 'was', 'strangling', 'won', 'result', 'hot', 'dog', 'competition', 'was', 'actually', 'alien', 'planet', 'Just', 'fact', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'alien', 'character', 'tried', 'hard', 'understand', 'people', 'earth', 'many', 'confusing', 'problems.Meet', 'Dave', 'just', 'all-around', 'terrific', 'comedy', 'highly', 'recommend', 'not', 'only', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'fans', 'anyone', 'who', 'well-made', 'consistently', 'funny', 'comedy']",Meet Dave

The movie basically is about a group of tiny aliens from Planet Nil who come down to earth in a human body like spaceship, which is the giant human version of ""Dave"". Dave is just a random name that Eddie Murphy's character gives when he awkwardly meets Gina after she accidentally runs him over with her car. We don't know what his 'real' name is, but it is probably not an earthlike name. Anyway the aliens have to save their home planet from an energy crisis so they try to drain the earth's oceans on get the special ""jewel"" that a bully steals from Gina's son's character (I can't recall his name). The giant Dave later has to shake the bully due upside down to recover the special orb from him.As the movie progresses Dave loses sight on the real mission and gets sidetracked with Gina and her son (I think he develops some romantic feelings for her). This start to get real complicated from here as the alien crew starts getting very frustrated and plan to overthrow him as captain and get back on the mission. It starts getting real funny and a bit scary as a different captain takes over and causes chaos on earth by zapping and destroying things, and soon all of the police are after the giant Dave.In the movie I love the growing bond between the aliens and the humans on earth. It shows that there can be an understanding between two completely different cultures or even species. I recommend you watch the movie in Blu-Ray for the special effects to be clearer. This is a classic entertaining movie that children of all ages will enjoy and there is a love and friendship theme to the movie. I first wanted to see it because I love Eddie Murphy movies (especially his Doctor DooLittle movies), but then I started liking the movie itself.",5,The movie should have been more popular than it is...GREAT Comedy!,1230422400,"12 28, 2008",2008,1907,"['Eddie', 'Murphy', 'Dave', 'Ming', 'Chang', 'small', 'alien', 'Gina', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'human', 'being', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'movie', 'playing', 'respective', 'characters', 'movie', 'basically', 'group', 'tiny', 'aliens', 'Planet', 'Nil', 'who', 'come', 'down', 'earth', 'human', 'body', 'spaceship', 'giant', 'human', 'version', 'Dave', 'Dave', 'just', 'random', 'name', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'character', 'when', 'awkwardly', 'Gina', 'accidentally', 'car', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', ""'real"", 'name', 'probably', 'not', 'earthlike', 'name', 'Anyway', 'aliens', 'have', 'save', 'home', 'planet', 'energy', 'crisis', 'try', 'drain', 'earth', 'oceans', 'get', 'special', 'jewel', 'bully', 'steals', 'Gina', 'son', 'character', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'name', 'giant', 'Dave', 'later', 'shake', 'bully', 'due', 'upside', 'down', 'recover', 'special', 'orb', 'movie', 'Dave', 'loses', 'sight', 'real', 'mission', 'sidetracked', 'Gina', 'son', 'think', 'romantic', 'feelings', 'start', 'get', 'real', 'complicated', 'here', 'alien', 'crew', 'getting', 'very', 'frustrated', 'plan', 'overthrow', 'captain', 'get', 'back', 'mission', 'getting', 'real', 'funny', 'bit', 'scary', 'different', 'captain', 'chaos', 'earth', 'zapping', 'destroying', 'things', 'soon', 'police', 'are', 'giant', 'Dave.In', 'movie', 'love', 'growing', 'bond', 'aliens', 'humans', 'earth', 'can', 'be', 'understanding', 'two', 'completely', 'different', 'cultures', 'even', 'species', 'recommend', 'watch', 'movie', 'Blu-Ray', 'special', 'effects', 'be', 'clearer', 'classic', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'children', 'ages', 'will', 'enjoy', 'love', 'friendship', 'theme', 'movie', 'first', 'wanted', 'see', 'love', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'movies', 'especially', 'Doctor', 'DooLittle', 'movies', 'then', 'started', 'liking', 'movie']",Meet Dave

""Meet Dave"" is the exception to these films.  It's funny, clever, and imaginative.  Visually it's a feast for the eyes.  Murphy essentially takes on two roles, the captain of a spaceship manned by miniature aliens who've come to Earth to extract ocean salt to save their planet and the spaceship itself that is a life-sized version of the captain decked out in Seventies disco attire.  Murphy shows the versatility and dexterity here that he did in other films that he took on multiple roles.  His work here recalls that of his idol, Jerry Lewis, and Peter Sellers.  I remember when this film came out in the Summer of '08 and did a slow fade among all the blockbusters.  This gentle funny fable is worth checking out.

In this film, Dave Ming-Chang(Murphy)is a kind but awkward gentleman who arrives in New York City and begins to learn the ways of the people. Unknown to the New Yorkers, Dave is actually an alien spaceship, with a very small humanoid crew led by its captain(also portrayed by Murphy), as they journey to earth to find a way to save their doomed planet. Along the way, Dave befriends a widowed mother(Banks) and her son, who happens to own the source of the evil energy that may destroy both earth and Dave's homeworld.

A number of crew members (the weapons expert is exposed to the Rockettes and is never the same, the tech guy finds MySpace)  play out some stereotypes that tend to get annoying, but do add a bit to the story.

1188085,A25QJBK33C4O0R,B001F7Q4IE,"terpfan1980 ""Barry""","[8, 10]","Meet Dave is definitely an under-rated film, but the question is by just how much?  Certainly Eddie Murphy has made some, well let's just say 'interesting' decisions when it comes to choices of movies to do.  He turned in Oscar calibre work in Dream Girls, but then took a serious dive by doing the relatively pathetic Norbert (which probably cost him the Oscar for Dream Girls).  Besides Dream Girls though, just what serious, or better labeled 'quality' work would anyone really remember Murphy from over the last several years?  You'd have to go back to the original 48 Hours, or Beverly Hills Cop movies to find material that would generate any sort of consensus as being 'quality work'.Murphy has turned out some family oriented, or at least youth oriented, films in the meantime including Daddy Day Care and the like, and the audience for that film seems to be the audience that is the target for Meet Dave.The Dave that viewers will be meeting turns out to be a space ship filled with tiny humanoids that have come to retrieve a device that was sent to gather materials for providing power in the homeworld of the space travellers.  The ship just happens to look like the captain who we see in the command chair, and of course the ship also resembles an Earthling which is supposed to make it easy for the space travellers to accomplish their mission while roving the planet.  Nothing could be quite so simple though as the travellers have researched Earth culture from a few different sources, none of which provide a complete and detailed enough view of the world to really help them blend in.  Along the way the inhabitants of Dave learn a lot about the Earth creatures and perhaps learn a lot about themselves as well.The movie basically bombed in theatres, and seems to be flying below the radar on Blu-ray and DVD which is somewhat sad as it would be entertaining for most families.  Take a chance and at least rent it and view it with an open mind and perhaps somewhat lowered expectations, you must might find it was worth the effort.(Note that if half-stars were possible, I'd probably put this in the 3.5 range, more down in the 3 star range.  I've rated it a little higher because it has been somewhat panned and under-rated, so I'm hoping the higher rating might balance out some of the non-love it may find along the way ;-) )",4,"Under-rated, but not by that much.

1188088,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B001F7Q4IE,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","""Meet Dave"" is a one joke movie stretched to the limit. Actually it was stretched way beyond the breaking point. The comedy is sporadically funny and even clever, but to pad out the film's running time, the filmmakers added easy jokes and uninteresting subplots. What makes me really sad is that the film stars Eddie Murphy. I really like him, but what happened to him?Eddie Murphy plays double roles in ""Meet Dave,"" a tiny humanoid alien captain of a man-sized spaceship that landed in New York City to save his dying planet, and the spaceship itself that resembles the captain. The first Murphy operates the second Murphy from within, with other crew including Gabrielle Union.On Earth the aliens (or the spaceship) befriend a single mother Gina Morrison (Elizabeth Banks) and her son Josh (Austin Lynd Myers). Josh happens to have a secret device that the crew of Eddie Murphy's spaceship, now called ""Dave Ming-Chang,"" must recover, no matter what it takes.Actually, what follows is a series of silly jokes. Some of them are funny, but soon the film runs out of tricks. You know, any aliens coming from outer space doesn't need much time to retrieve a lost object from an unsuspecting boy, so ""Dave Ming-Chang"" finds a romantic interest in an unlikely figure. There is also a subplot about a police officer seeking the crash-landed spaceship (played by Scott Caan). The writers hired for the film seem to have been so desperate.Eddie Murphy has played multiple roles in his films and in most cases the results are effective. But playing a spaceship (and walking and talking while being controlled from inside) is something new to him, and here he is just OK. Some people may find Eddie Murphy walking like a broken robot very funny. Sorry, but not me, perhaps because I still remember him as the star of ""48 Hrs"" ""Trading Places"" and ""Beverly Hills Cop.""I almost forgot this. The director of ""Meet Dave"" is Brian Robbins, whose films as director include ""Good Burger,"" ""Varsity Blues"" ""Ready to Rumble"" ""Hardball"" ""The Perfect Score"" ""The Shaggy Dog"" and awful ""Norbit,"" the last one starring Eddie Murphy.

1188089,A2Y55P7L3NFZ2F,B001F7Q4IE,"T. Thompson ""Clydesight Productions""","[0, 0]","This is a fun movie that really needs to be taken as pure humor. Leave the logic on the doorstep for this one, and just go for the laughs and the charm. Yes, it does have its cliche moments. Most of the characters are stereotypes, except of course Dave.He's actually a spaceship.The thing to watch it for is the humor (which sometimes is awkward and embarrassing), the character development and the interactions of the characters, and of course, the sci fi elements. This movie is about relationships and that's what to watch for, as the alien crew -- who apparently are logical and cold in the beginning -- develop compassion and a form of bonding they would not be able to otherwise.It's also refreshing to see a space alien movie where there is no monster or judgement of humanity as being so totally worthless that we deserved to be wiped out. The film has more in common with the original ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"" than any other alien invasion movie. and yes, DAVE arrives on Earth to do harm, not for a friendly visit. But that all changes during the course of the movie, and it's part of the film's charm.The film also borrows heavily from the ""corporate"" structure of advanced civilizations, as the DAVE ship is manned by a crew that are similar to Star Trek's Federation, but have a bit more in common with Galaxy Quest's ""Protector"" wonderfully silly Thermians.The DAVE spaceship is an original concept, to be sure. The idea of making a space ship look like a human being is new to sci fi, and apparently was so impressive that the folks at Doctor Who lifted the idea and used it (they called their human spaceship a ""Teselector"")  to conclude one of their seasons with Matt Smith as the Doctor. If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, ""Meet Dave"" got a bump from Doctor Who.Of course, Eddie Murphy and his comic expressions are what make most of the humor and he delivers a full performance that is funny and charming at the same time. The rest of the cast are believable and sympathetic, and mostly what we've seen before in many movies -- the nerdy kid with low self esteem, the crazy single mom, the protective boy friend, and the incompetent police force. Nothing new to see here, but it's fun to watch them interact.This is a family friendly movie.There's no ""cussing"", little violence other than ""prat falls"" - except for one scene where the DAVE spaceship escapes from a police station, which is actually very cool and we do not believe anyone got seriously hurt.There is no killing, no one gets beaten up or raped, no one gets drunk or drugged, so it is safe even for young children. However, some kids may not get the deeper sci-fi parody jokes, but they'll probably enjoy the film for the broader comedy.""Meet Dave"" is worth a look for all these reasons, and if for nothing else, to see the idea of a spaceship made to look and act human.
