Cote left her role... repeat Cote LEFT - they offered her more money and she turned them down, they offered her even more money and she again refused. If you wish to leave a show over creative differences (IF that indeed was her reason) then fine but say so & be honest with your fans (of which I WAS one) - she had a sweet gig and she abandoned the show and it's fans She was a prima donna and SHE chose to leave - bring her back - I say to hell with her. She left us. Just like Pernell Roberts left Bonanza - she left a top rated show on her own - I wouldn't watch a show with her on it - she is a loser.Bishop sucks, those eyebrow are horrible. I agree. But this show has a long history of characters leaving and being killed - Bishop needs to be the next. Even after Cote left this show was still number one - till they started putting the Voice on successive nights. People criticize Bishop - yet now praise Kate whom over the years almost everybody panned in favor of the Ziva character.Again Cote was not fired, she left on her own - SHE left us - yes, Bishop needs to go, I agree. I own all ten seasons of Jag and 1-9 of NCIS. NCIS Los Angles is all International Terrorism and seldom involves the actual investigation of a marine or sailor. The new: NCIS New Orleans will only survive as long as it is between or follows these two shows, NCIS must bring in an experienced female actor (not a young hottie - per se) and Tony finally needs a steady.NCIS has a history of killing characters: Kate and Jenny plus Leon's wife to name a few - Ziva should of been eliminated such as a plane crash into the the ocean - which could leave the door open... for a reunion. We saw Criminal Minds bring in the talented and experienced Jeanne Tripplehorn for two seasons after ditching Agent Prentiss. NCIS needs to bring a not so younger - yet attractive and experienced female to fit in and blend in with our faves and then decide to keep her, kill her or find another replacement. If they do that I will buy season 11 knowing that Bishop was a one season mistake - or it could be just a bad dream of Tony's and Cote comes back like Bobby (Patrick Duffy) did in Dallas... they get together and get married and she retires... otherwise this show will die, New Orleans NCIS right behind it and NCIS LA a season later.",3,"Bishop Stinks, yes, BUT Cote DESERTED us",1405814400,"07 20, 2014",2014,2399,"['Let', 'get', 'real', 'here', 'people', 'quit', 'petty', 'spoiled', 'moaning', 'groaning', 'grow', 'up', 'Cote', 'left', 'role', 'repeat', 'Cote', 'LEFT', 'offered', 'more', 'money', 'turned', 'down', 'offered', 'even', 'more', 'money', 'again', 'refused', 'wish', 'leave', 'show', 'creative', 'differences', 'IF', 'indeed', 'was', 'reason', 'then', 'fine', 'say', 'so', 'be', 'honest', 'fans', 'WAS', 'one', 'had', 'sweet', 'gig', 'abandoned', 'show', 'fans', 'was', 'prima', 'donna', 'SHE', 'chose', 'leave', 'bring', 'back', 'say', 'hell', 'left', 'Just', 'Pernell', 'Roberts', 'left', 'Bonanza', 'left', 'top', 'rated', 'show', 'own', 'would', ""n't"", 'watch', 'show', 'loser.Bishop', 'sucks', 'eyebrow', 'are', 'horrible', 'agree', 'show', 'long', 'history', 'characters', 'leaving', 'being', 'killed', 'Bishop', 'be', 'next', 'Even', 'Cote', 'left', 'show', 'was', 'still', 'number', 'one', 'till', 'started', 'putting', 'Voice', 'successive', 'nights', 'People', 'criticize', 'Bishop', 'yet', 'now', 'praise', 'Kate', 'whom', 'years', 'almost', 'everybody', 'panned', 'favor', 'Ziva', 'character.Again', 'Cote', 'was', 'not', 'fired', 'left', 'own', 'SHE', 'left', 'yes', 'Bishop', 'go', 'agree', 'own', 'ten', 'seasons', 'Jag', '1-9', 'NCIS', 'NCIS', 'Los', 'Angles', 'International', 'Terrorism', 'seldom', 'actual', 'investigation', 'marine', 'sailor', 'new', 'NCIS', 'New', 'Orleans', 'will', 'only', 'survive', 'as', 'long', 'two', 'shows', 'NCIS', 'must', 'bring', 'experienced', 'female', 'actor', 'not', 'young', 'hottie', 'se', 'Tony', 'finally', 'steady.NCIS', 'history', 'killing', 'characters', 'Kate', 'Jenny', 'Leon', 'wife', 'name', 'few', 'Ziva', 'should', 'been', 'eliminated', 'such', 'plane', 'crash', 'ocean', 'could', 'leave', 'door', 'open', 'reunion', 'saw', 'Criminal', 'Minds', 'bring', 'talented', 'experienced', 'Jeanne', 'Tripplehorn', 'two', 'seasons', 'ditching', 'Agent', 'Prentiss', 'NCIS', 'bring', 'not', 'so', 'younger', 'yet', 'attractive', 'experienced', 'female', 'fit', 'blend', 'faves', 'then', 'decide', 'keep', 'kill', 'find', 'replacement', 'do', 'will', 'buy', 'season', '11', 'knowing', 'Bishop', 'was', 'one', 'season', 'mistake', 'could', 'be', 'just', 'bad', 'dream', 'Tony', 'Cote', 'back', 'like', 'Bobby', 'Patrick', 'Duffy', 'did', 'Dallas', 'get', 'together', 'get', 'married', 'otherwise', 'show', 'will', 'die', 'New', 'Orleans', 'NCIS', 'right', 'NCIS', 'LA', 'season', 'later']",N/A

I even responded ""OOOrah"" to a man as I got off an elevator last week after hearing him say ""Semper Fi"" to another man.  He grinned and turned to look at me and I said ""huge Gibb's fan"".  He nodded.  I'm a grandmother and not a marine so I hope I was not being disrespectful as I meant it with utmost respect.  I will buy this season when it is released as I have all the others, but will not pay the price that it costs at this time (my least favorite season).  I think the Bishop character is shallow and uninteresting and has no major contribution to the show.  Leave all the terrorism plots to NCIS: L.A.  Glad the later episodes are starting to feel like the previous seasons.  I look forward to a tribute show recognizing Ralph Waite/Jackson Gibbs. I'm sure they are all reeling from Cote's unexpected departure, as we all are.  Change happens and ""the show must go on"", but I hope the NCIS family will find their way back to the quality, chemistry and human interests storylines we all love and look forward to each week.  It's patriotism, humor and caring, not only for each other but for the secondary characters, is what we all appreciate (love Gibb's with children and animals).  I would like to see Coast Guard Abby as the replacement for Ziva.  Even Colonel Hollis Mann would be a better fit than Bishop if Susanna Thompson is available.

1652249,A1LH7YTNTWP6MT,B00CYQXF6O,Andrew Furst,"[14, 18]","NCIS was once a terrific show - interesting plots and action, great dialog, great chemistry among the team members.  Series creator Don Bellisario made it work for many seasons, but he has been gone for the last several.  Even without Bellisario the series was pretty good, though with a distinct turn toward ""politically correct"" liberalism now being shoved down viewers throats.  However, this season the new character ""Ellie Bishop"" is bringing the whole thing down, along with amateurish writing and still more heavy-handed promotion of liberal values (as if there wasn't already enough of that on all other tv/movie productions).Bishop with her heavy dark eyebrows and bleached dirty-blonde hair looks like Oscar the Grouch from Sesame Street.  And much like Oscar T. Grouch, Ellie's character is almost entirely unappealing, furthermore she gets in the way of the former chemistry of other characters by becoming too much of a focal point.  Her character has marginalized Gibbs, as she ""outsmarts"" him at every turn, and he's reduced mainly to being her cheerleader (he'll just stand by and say ""Think Ellie, think!"" so that she can come up with an idea that will save the day).  This is not remotely believable in the context of prior seasons of the show.It's amazing that this show has fallen so far, so fast.  The glory years were clearly the ones produced by Bellisario, but the momentum carried on for a few seasons after that.  Now every new episode is like hearing a new album from a rock star who peaked 20-40 years ago; you hope for a little of that past magic but you are always disappointed.  Much of this could have been avoided with a better female replacement for Ziva (such as agent Borin of the Coast Guard, or McGee's girlfriend Delilah) but the stories and writing were already severely going downhill.

1652251,A2TXR85WQLE32N,B00CYQXF6O,D. S. Thurlow,"[0, 0]","NCIS returns for an eleventh season as the cast goes through a major shake-up. Former Mossad Agent, now U.S. citizen Ziva David departs in an emotional two-part story at the beginning of the season. She and Tony will at long last address the meaning of their relationship as she goes into hiding in Israel (and only Tony can track her down).Meanwhile, the team will carry on, after a fashion.  Viewers will be treated to the search for Ziva's replacement, who ends up being Eleanor Bishop, NSA whiz kid.  Bishop gets rapidly integrated into the team.  As a look at other reviews would indicate, however, the jury is still very out on Bishop, who has altered the team chemistry.  For much of the season, she will need significant mentoring by Gibbs.  Tony will hang out with McGee, as the two of them seem to have little in common with the much younger, inexperienced and married Bishop.  Just to keep it interesting, Gibbs will also have to deal with a new and demanding (female) Secretary of the Navy in the frequent absence of NCIS Director Vance. This SecNav can't seem to resist getting involved in Gibbs' business.The team will battle terrorists, human traffickers, and other assorted criminals.  Gibbs and Tony DiNozzo will have occasion to revisit the origins of their relationship, in an early episode that takes Tony back to his beat-cop days in Baltimore.  Red-headed Coast Guard CGIS Agent Abby Borin will make a welcome reappearance, as will Tony's misbehaving father Tony Sr. (Robert Wagner).  A highlight of the season is the introduction of the cast of NCIS New Orleans, who get two episodes with the regulars this season and their own show in the next.  Most emotional of all will be a final episode for Gibbs' aging father, played by Ralph Waite, who rates a special tribute in the season finale after his death.NCIS was renewed for a twelfth season, but fans have to be wondering what's left in the tank for a show that has had a great run but seems to be losing steam.

1652253,AMQ9F8CHMFIGQ,B00CYQXF6O,Genny,"[17, 22]","There is just no cohesion with the new addition to the team. I was really hoping that Delilah would be the new team member, but I gave this girl an objective chance. You just never know how her character may develop. Turns out, she's just as boring now as she was in her first episode. Just watched the newest episode last night and realized she just strikes me as juvenile and unprofessional. Her character has a ""hippie"" dynamic that just doesn't work. The whole scatter-brained, ADD routine is getting old really fast. She is married, but the husband is so rarely mentioned that this is easily forgotten. She never speaks about him and goes about living much as an unattached person. I really thought once they made her a permanent agent that we would be introduced to the husband as they settled into D.C. Now, I think the writers are hoping we forget the whole husband thing altogether. The show needs to pull it together before viewers just lose interest. There's nothing sadder than a really good tv show that just gives up.Update 6/5/14:Now that the season has concluded, here are my final thoughts:It seems that in the last few episodes, they pulled back on the whole quirky, hippie, unprofessional personality. Bishop now fades into the background in a really vanilla sort of way. She is just another character with no truly dynamic qualities. I loved this show so much that I own seasons 1-10. However, I will NOT be purchasing season 11. I enjoyed the opening episodes, a 2-parter farewell to Ziva, and I so appreciated that they honored Ralph Waite in the final episode ""Honor thy Father."" But it is not worth purchasing the entire season for those 3 little gems. Season 11 was a total disaster. They chose the actress for Bishop to be the new team member without even the first ""trial"" episode to the viewers. NO ONE likes this character. As someone else here commented, ""they have really jumped the shark."" If they don't replace Bishop with someone better, the show is over. Bring Delilah back. I don't care if she is in a wheelchair, this character has dimension.

1652254,A1CUIY7H79BOI8,B00CYQXF6O,Granny,"[12, 18]","I'm really sad about what has happened to NCIS.  For ten years, this has been my favorite show on tv.  I watch very little tv actually; 3 or 4 PBS shows, (can't miss This Old House!) and occasionally I watch one or two of  the ""newsmagazine"" shows (such as 48 Hours.)NCIS was different from all other shows on tv, for many reasons.  The most important one for me was the superb writing.  Each show was a stand-alone gem of witty repartee and group dymanic, laugh out loud non-sequiturs from Ziva, and solid crime-solving think-tanking with each member of the team contributing in their own unique way.  No one got in the way of any other character, or assumed more importance than the others.  They operated as a tight team with a goal.  And all the while Gibbs kept them on their mark, keping them from wandering too far off base but (even though it annoyed him!) he would allow for their individual personalities popping out in unexpected ways.I own all 10 previous seasons of NCIS (thank you Amazon!) and I watch them regularly.  I sometimes have different family members over and we have an NCIS marathon, watching an entire season or two in a day.  I have loved this show from the beginning, planning my Tuesdays around it.I don't watch it anymore.  I have given it up, with great regret.  Losing Cote (she's making a movie with Antonio Banderas) was bad enough, but the writing has changed, also.  It's now just another run-of-the-mill crime show, and not a good one, either.  Bishop is extremely boring and annoying, irritating, insulting, rude, silly, immature, and just plain unlikeable.  I watched the first 3 or 4 shows with her, and the whole team dynamic was ruined.  Gibbs, Tony and McGee are all different; bland, I guess.  Gibbs defers to Bishop as if she's such a genius the rest of the team is unnecessary.  So, she was trying to get some sort of insight about a bad guy, first by spreading out some photos on the floor and staring at them.  When that didn't work, she spread them out on a desk and got on top of a file cabinet to stare down at them to ""get a different perspective.""  Really?  I mean, come on, seriously?  Is she like, 8 or 10 years old?  Is this what the viewers have to look forward to with the writing?  At that point, I shut it off, and haven't watched it since.  Sorry, Gibbs, Tony, McGee, Ducky, and Abby.
