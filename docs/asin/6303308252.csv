It stars Ann Harding, Leslie Howard and Myrna Loy. Also with William Gargan, Ilka Chase and Neil Hamilton. Max Steiner wrote the score and George Cukor is an uncredited director.Cinematographer George Folsey also photographedTHE COCOANUTS(1929),ANIMAL CRACKERS(1930), THE BIG BROADCAST (1932),RIO RITA(1942),MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS(1944), THE HARVEY GIRLS (1946), TILL THE CLOUDS ROLL BY (1946),STATE OF THE UNION(1948),ADAM'S RIB(1949), MILLION DOLLAR MERMAID (1952),THE BAND WAGON(1953),EXECUTIVE SUITE(1954), SEVEN BRIDES FOR SEVEN BROTHERS (1954),HIT THE DECK(1955) andFORBIDDEN PLANET(1956).The plot is fairly simple. Howard gets engaged to Loy a month after they met and he breaks off with longtime girlfriend Harding. He comes to regret the marriage and passage into high society and misses a previous Bohemian lifestyle where no one manipulated or demanded things of him. Also, Loy's snooty friends aren't to his liking and she can't stand Howard's best pal, a working class ex-boxer who's his butler.It's not hard to figure out how this very adult story ends.One moment that surprises is when Howard visits Harding intending to announce his engagement. The timing's awful, for she's got babies on her mind and proposes marriage, even if it's only long enough to conceive a child. That way their offspring wouldn't be stigmatized. Wow, what year was this?TRIVIAKate Hepburn was considered for Loy's role.Howard, Gargan and Chase originated their roles on Broadway. The play had a 183 performance run.Although fairly liked now, this film was a box office disaster for Selznick.It lost $110,000, a monstrous sum by today's standards.",4,"""A foolish virgin me...

There is little comedic action and what is intended as such has not improved with age. Based on a stage play by Philip Barry who later wrote The Philadelphia Story, this screenplay has been eclipsed by the decline and fall of morals and marriage, which makes the alleged wanton behavior seem trite and ponderous.The source print used by Alpha is far better than the usual used by Alpha. Although it is clean with only a couple of missing frames, it is soft and the contrast is thin, which means some scenes are washed out, so to speak.When released during 1932, this pre-code film produced by David Selznick,  was a shocker due to it's blunt and realistic portrayal of romance and marriages of convenience.

368664,A6S7155T8VTHK,6303308252,J. F. McCausland,"[2, 3]","The Animal Kingdom is an intelligent and witty film about the complexities of human relationships, written by famous playwrite Philip Barry, who also wrote personal favorites Holiday and The Philadelphia Story. Wealthy Tom Collier is living with his Bohemian girlfriend, Daisy Sage. He starts a publishing company that focuses on avant-garde works popular with his friends. When pressured by his family to marry, he does not choose Daisy, but the more proper wife material, Cecilia Henry. But the wife he has doesn't prove to be the wife he wants. Cecelia is typically conventional, and insists that Tom publish books that will sell and make money. She dislikes Red Regan, a friend and former boxer whom Tom has hired as a butler, and wants him fired, as he doesn't fit in with her snobbish ideals of society style servants. (His drunken behavior at one of her society bashes may have influenced her dislike!) Tom becomes restless with his ill-fitting lifestyle and approaches Daisy to resume their unconventional relationship. This film was made Pre-code, and thank goodness for that, as this film is quite frank, not only its subject, but in the open dialogue. Cecelia withholds sex to get what she wants, and Tom thinks her decorating style is similar to a brothel he once visited. The story contrasts the selfish, conventional attitudes of the haves against the idealistic and more carefree beliefs of the have-nots, and clearly finds the have-nots the better people. (Speaking as one of the have-nots, that's my interpretation, and I'm sticking to it!) The cast in this film is one of the best assembled for any film. Howard played the role on Broadway, so clearly he knows this character inside and out. Collier is completely different from the idealistic dreamer character Howard was typecast with later in his career, and he manages to fully capture the essence of the carefree playboy turned conventional husband who slowly realizes he has made a very serious mistake in judgment. Ann Harding is wonderful as the Pre-Hippie Daisy Sage. She is one of my favorite actresses, and this film features one of  her best performances. The surprise is Myrna Loy, who later became famous as The Perfect Wife, the character she typically played (especially in the Thin Man series). But this is not that! Cecelia is selfish, manipulative, and sometimes quite cruel, but she is one of the most interesting characters in the story. Like Holiday and The Philadelphia Story, the script sparkles with wit and charm, and the characters use and twist the language into clever bon mots, the way we normal people only dream of talking. (Daisy: [on Collier's wedding day] ""A foolish virgin, me. Oh, foolish anyway."") Surprisingly, although the play was quite successful, the movie version never found its proper audience. That's a pity, because it is a brilliant piece of work, every bit as fun and entertaining as Barry's better known plays.",5,A sophisticated Pre-Code romance,1329350400,"02 16, 2012",2012,2929,"['Animal', 'Kingdom', 'intelligent', 'witty', 'film', 'complexities', 'human', 'relationships', 'written', 'famous', 'playwrite', 'Philip', 'Barry', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'personal', 'favorites', 'Holiday', 'Philadelphia', 'Story', 'Wealthy', 'Tom', 'Collier', 'living', 'Bohemian', 'girlfriend', 'Daisy', 'Sage', 'publishing', 'company', 'avant-garde', 'works', 'popular', 'friends', 'When', 'pressured', 'family', 'marry', 'not', 'choose', 'Daisy', 'more', 'proper', 'wife', 'material', 'Cecilia', 'Henry', 'wife', ""n't"", 'prove', 'be', 'wife', 'Cecelia', 'typically', 'conventional', 'Tom', 'publish', 'books', 'will', 'sell', 'make', 'money', 'Red', 'Regan', 'friend', 'former', 'boxer', 'whom', 'Tom', 'hired', 'butler', 'fired', ""n't"", 'fit', 'snobbish', 'ideals', 'society', 'style', 'servants', 'drunken', 'behavior', 'one', 'society', 'bashes', 'may', 'have', 'influenced', 'dislike', 'Tom', 'restless', 'ill-fitting', 'lifestyle', 'approaches', 'Daisy', 'resume', 'unconventional', 'relationship', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'Pre-code', 'thank', 'goodness', 'film', 'quite', 'frank', 'not', 'only', 'subject', 'open', 'dialogue', 'Cecelia', 'sex', 'get', 'what', 'Tom', 'decorating', 'style', 'similar', 'brothel', 'once', 'visited', 'story', 'selfish', 'conventional', 'attitudes', 'haves', 'idealistic', 'more', 'carefree', 'beliefs', 'have-nots', 'clearly', 'have-nots', 'better', 'people', 'Speaking', 'one', 'have-nots', 'interpretation', ""'m"", 'sticking', 'cast', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'assembled', 'film', 'Howard', 'played', 'role', 'Broadway', 'so', 'clearly', 'character', 'inside', 'out', 'Collier', 'completely', 'different', 'idealistic', 'dreamer', 'character', 'Howard', 'was', 'typecast', 'later', 'career', 'fully', 'capture', 'essence', 'carefree', 'playboy', 'turned', 'conventional', 'husband', 'who', 'slowly', 'made', 'very', 'serious', 'mistake', 'judgment', 'Ann', 'Harding', 'wonderful', 'Pre-Hippie', 'Daisy', 'Sage', 'one', 'favorite', 'actresses', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'surprise', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'who', 'later', 'became', 'famous', 'Perfect', 'Wife', 'character', 'typically', 'played', 'especially', 'Thin', 'Man', 'series', 'not', 'Cecelia', 'selfish', 'manipulative', 'sometimes', 'quite', 'cruel', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'characters', 'story', 'Holiday', 'Philadelphia', 'Story', 'script', 'wit', 'charm', 'characters', 'use', 'twist', 'language', 'clever', 'bon', 'mots', 'way', 'normal', 'people', 'only', 'dream', 'talking', 'Daisy', '[', 'Collier', 'wedding', 'day', ']', 'A', 'foolish', 'virgin', 'Oh', 'foolish', 'anyway', 'Surprisingly', 'play', 'was', 'quite', 'successful', 'movie', 'version', 'never', 'found', 'proper', 'audience', 'pity', 'brilliant', 'piece', 'work', 'bit', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'Barry', 'better', 'known', 'plays']",Animal Kingdom VHS
368665,A2R6RA8FRBS608,6303308252,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[6, 7]","The Animal Kingdom sports some mighty terrific acting by a wonderful cast. The plot of this pre-code drama moves along at a very good pace; it could have been edited just a little but this is very minor. The cinematography is very well done throughout the film; and the choreography works best in crowded scenes including the surprise birthday party. There are two very minor disappointments: The quality of the print could have been a little bit better; and once or twice there was the very obvious and distinctly different noises of the two cameras that were rolling when a scene involved two people talking.When the action starts, we quickly meet the somewhat bohemian Tom Collier (Leslie Howard) who happily owns and runs The Bantam Press, a small independent publishing company. He lives with his girlfriend Daisy Sage (Ann Harding); Tom and Daisy snub the conventional wisdom of the time that a man and a woman had to be married before they could live together. Tom's father Rufus Collier (Henry Stephenson) has nothing but disdain for Tom's lifestyle; but it is the pretty society girl Cecilia ""Cee"" Henry (Myrna Loy) who steals Tom from Daisy when Daisy is away for a while. In fact, as the picture begins, Daisy is sailing into New York harbor that night only to find out that Tom, who she still thinks is her man, will be marrying ""Cee"" very soon.Daisy certainly does take it very badly, although she admits along with Tom that they never had any real strings attached to their relationship. Tom still wants to be friends with Daisy and see her from time to time; but Daisy angrily refuses and Tom leaves without even taking his belongings. After Tom marries ""Cee,"" he never sees his old friends anymore; his quirky butler and friend ""Red"" Regan (William Gargan) stays on--but only for a while. ""Red"" can't take the stuffiness of life in Connecticut with ""Cee"" and Tom so he leaves just as ""Cee"" has convinced Tom to fire him anyway.Tom eventually simply shows up at Daisy's Manhattan apartment and they quickly rekindle their friendship--and their old flame, too. Tom doesn't tell all of this to ""Cee;"" but ""Cee"" decides to test how everything is going  by throwing a surprise birthday party for Tom--and ""Cee"" makes sure to invite Daisy as well as Tom's old friends ""Franc"" Schmidt (Leni Stengel) and Joe Fiske (Don Dillaway).What happens at that party? ""Cee"" has also invited a man who has not so secretly wanted her for a long time, a fellow named Owen (Neil Hamilton)--how will he figure into all this? Will ""Cee"" and Daisy get along that night? What will happen if ""Red"" has trouble on his new job and wants to return to his old job working for Tom and ""Cee?"" Watch and find out!The DVD comes with nothing in the way of extras except scene selection; but with these budget DVDs that's the way it goes, I guess.The Animal Kingdom showcases the fabulous talents of Leslie Howard, Ann Harding and Myrna Loy.

It revolves around a man, his former mistress, and his current wife. Leslie Howard plays Tom Collier, a wealthy man whose family wishes he would settle down and be more dignified. He does so with Cecilia (Myrna Loy), a somewhat haughty, controlling woman from high society. However, in order to make his marriage work, his mistress Daisy (Ann Harding) breaks ties with him. He is hurt by the separation and begins to pursue her without realizing his true feelings for her.The relationships between the characters are very believable and engrossing. It helps that the stars are phenomenal actors. Howard is particularly wonderful. His acting is subtle but charming, intelligent, and powerful. Everything he says seems important and thoughtful, even if he's delivering a casual response. Harding complements him well.

Howard plays a rich publisher who leaves his artist-mistress to marry socially active Loy, only to discover that the security of married life doesn't exist: his wife turns out to be a Lorelei who's encouraging an affair with another man (Hamilton)... In an ironic and interesting contrast, Loy acts more like his mistress and Harding is more wife-like. Howard's acting expertise is shown to advantage here, he being caught in a classic triangle and eventually realising just how essentially shallow Loy really is and what a prize he had in Harding. Ann Harding gives her usual sensitively sincere performance and although Myrna Loy was not yet considered star material when she was given the role of Cecilia, she clearly gives a masterful portrayal of the flirtatious vixen. There is a splendidly amusing performance given by William Gargan as Regan the butler: at a party, he pours himself drinks and oafishly makes himself at home, acting as if he belonged among the elite company. It is, however, Howard who carries the film: he was the epitome of the sensitive gentleman in films such as this in the decade of the 1930's.",4,SOLID EARLY TALKIE.,1031184000,"09 5, 2002",2002,1283,"['Philip', 'Barry', 'very', 'successful', 'stage', 'play', 'was', 'basis', 'well-acted', 'romantic', 'vehicle', 'should', 'still', 'appeal', 'sophisticated', 'intellectual', 'Howard', 'rich', 'publisher', 'who', 'artist-mistress', 'marry', 'socially', 'active', 'Loy', 'only', 'discover', 'security', 'married', 'life', ""n't"", 'exist', 'wife', 'out', 'be', 'Lorelei', 'who', 'encouraging', 'affair', 'man', 'Hamilton', 'ironic', 'interesting', 'contrast', 'Loy', 'more', 'mistress', 'Harding', 'more', 'wife-like', 'Howard', 'acting', 'expertise', 'shown', 'advantage', 'here', 'being', 'caught', 'classic', 'triangle', 'eventually', 'realising', 'just', 'how', 'essentially', 'shallow', 'Loy', 'really', 'what', 'prize', 'had', 'Harding', 'Ann', 'Harding', 'usual', 'sensitively', 'sincere', 'performance', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'was', 'not', 'yet', 'considered', 'star', 'material', 'when', 'was', 'given', 'role', 'Cecilia', 'clearly', 'masterful', 'portrayal', 'flirtatious', 'vixen', 'splendidly', 'amusing', 'performance', 'given', 'William', 'Gargan', 'Regan', 'butler', 'party', 'drinks', 'oafishly', 'home', 'acting', 'belonged', 'elite', 'company', 'however', 'Howard', 'who', 'film', 'was', 'epitome', 'sensitive', 'gentleman', 'films', 'such', 'decade', '1930']",Animal Kingdom VHS

368671,APRZ2IVM8JTLV,6303308252,The Mysterious Traveler,"[4, 11]","THE ANIMAL KINGDOM (1932) Directed by Edward Griffith and George Cukor. Based on the play by Philip Barry. Score by Max Steiner. Produced by David O Selznick.Starring Leslie Howard, Ann Harding, William Gargan, Neil Hamilton, Henry Stephenson and Myna Loy.Howard plays a ""rebel"" book publisher filled to the brim with ""integrity"" and ""unconventionality"" who pals around with the ""enlightened"" crowd in Manhattan.  However on the eve of his marriage to a ""conventional"" Loy discovers that his long time female friend with whom he has maintained an ""unconventioal"" relationship actually loves him in that bourgious way the unwashed do each other.As his new wife tries to get him to act like a decent human being, Howard finds himself publishing books that the public wants to read and make money......much to the disgust of his city friends who accuse him of losing his integrity.Finally Howard calls his wife a whore.......in that round about 30s way and goes off to live unconventionaly with his old girlfriend where they can congratualte themselves on their integrity and superiority over the great unwashed.Probably one of the most thoroughly unpleasant films made in the 1930s, this tribute to snobbery, elitism and intolerance is also thoroughly dishonest and dull to boot.  The film is one long euphemism that presumably only the ""enlightened"" would be able to translate. The rest of us stoops presumably being to ignorant to figure it out.Well let me translate.  Harding and Howard have been engaging in a kinky sex relationship with her as a dominant and Howard as a submissive. Her close friend is a lesbian.  The ""crowd"" Howard associates with are Communists and the books dripping with integrity that he publishes are communist propaganda and various party literature.  When he ""sells"" out, he is no longer publishing Party propaganda but ""bright"" literature which presumably are things that do nothing for the Revolution. He is then ostracized by the Party for violating discipline. Finally Howard......a self centered jerk throughout basically calls his wife a capitalist whore and goes back to the Party.The end.  Not very hard when one knows how. Basically what happened to Albert Maltz in the 40s and dramatized honestly in the 1949 film THE RED MENACE.Besides the above, the film is poorly directed.......basically a staged play. The earlier filmed play SIN TAKES A HOLIDAY, for example, is practically CITIZEN KANE cinematographywise compared to this. Loy is good but everyone else except Hamilton and Stephenson especially Harding and Gargan are hideous.  The dialogue is so oblique that everyone is practically just mumbling loudly for all the meaning it has.  One needs the Verona transcripts to understand it.The film bombed so badly that RKO was terrified into making KING KONG and later GUNGA DIN and leaving the commie prop to a later generation of filmmakers.Simply horrid.Interestingly enough MUSCLE BEACH PARTY with Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello has the same plot but instead of communists has surfers..........and is far more diverting.",1,Shovel needed!!
