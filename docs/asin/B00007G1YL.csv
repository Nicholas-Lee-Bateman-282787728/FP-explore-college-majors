728338,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,B00007G1YL,Annie Van Auken,"[5, 5]","In the late 1970s, I did a foolhardy thing. Armed with a used $10 Argus SLR camera, I walked through a blizzard in downtown New Haven, taking b&w; snapshots of the havoc that a raging storm could cause. As afternoon turned to evening, winds grew to near-hurricane strength and pushed me toward home, three miles up Whitney Ave. Had the gusts blown in my face instead of on my back, I might've died from exposure. As it was, I barely made it to safety after two hours of struggle. The backs of my legs were bright red and numb to the touch for a full day. I'd escaped frostbite by inches.Having first-hand experience of the blinding snow, bitter cold and fierce gusts of a blizzard, and the pain these cause, I cannot imagine how any of the Donner Party's remaining 46 survived NINE such blasts, way up in the Sierras where the temps are much lower, with no food and little shelter, for nearly five long months. Drifts 20 feet deep... it's incomprehensible!Everything seemed to conspire against these emigrants to California: bad advice on a ""short-cut"" that proved longer by far and more treacherous, a band of attacking Indians that killed much of their cattle, and a snowfall that closed the mountain pass only one day before they reached it. Had their small wagon train left Missouri just a little earlier or taken the well-worn, proven path by the Great Salt Lake. If they'd only rested their oxen four instead of five days before making that last push up the pass...So many what ifs, so much tragedy.The starving were forced to strip what little flesh that remained from the dead, cook and eat it, just to survive.  And yet, some time after the ordeal, Virginia Reid claimed in a letter to a cousin that her family were the only ones that didn't resort to cannibalism. How is it possible to go all that time without food and still have everyone in your family survive, while death and the unthinkable is all around you?Just one of the unasked questions this 90 minute AMERICAN EXPERIENCE documentary leaves us with. Narrated by the late, lamented David McCullough, and with the voice contributions of Amy Madigan, Eli Wallach, George Plimpton, Timothy Hutton and others, this 1992 episode of that long-running PBS series remains one of its very best.Written and directed by Ric Burns, who uses antique photos (obviously post-1846), newspaper and other print relics, plus survivng letters to tell this most harrowing of stories, which is summed up in its last moment by the quote that tops this review.""The Donner Party"" is a show not for the faint of heart or the easily offended.

728344,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,B00007G1YL,Erik North,"[0, 0]","PBS's long-running documentary series ""The American Experience"" had provided a huge mine for all who are deeply interested in our country's rich history.  One aspect of that history is in the big westward migration of the mid-19th century that eventually led to the northwestern part of what was once Mexico coming under American control.  And of all the stories of that part of our history, none has been as heartbreaking, poignant, or shocking as that of the Donner Party, that emigrant wagon train that, through several fatal mistakes, the biggest of which was taking a cut-off through the Utah mountains and the Great Salt Lake Desert, found itself stranded during the harsh winter of 1846-47 in the Sierra Nevada, only one hundred fifty miles short of their final goal--Sutter's Fort in Sacramento, California.As documented by Ric Burns, brother of Ken Burns, THE DONNER PARTY recounts how two prominent families of Springfield, Illinois, led by James Reed and George Donner, decided to make that long 2500-mile track west to California in order to make a better life for themselves.  With narration by David McCullough, and excerpts of diaries read by people like Eli Wallach, Amy Madigan, J.D. Cannon, and others, we get a sense of the roughness and danger of the cross-country journey, and how much more dangerous it got when the Reeds and the Donners made the catastrophic mistake of listening to the advice of an ambitious would-be ""emperor"" named Lansford Hastings and took a shortcut across rugged terrain that could only be accessible on horseback and certainly not in a wagon.  The party lost almost an entire summer making that dangerous ""shortcut"" that actually turned out to be much longer and much more treacherous than the established path.  And while they reached the foot of the Sierras in the last week of October in what was thought to be enough time left to cross the pass that would eventually be named for them, they unfortunately got caught in an early blizzard, losing their race with the weather by one single day.  What happened over the next five months in the Sierras remains one of the greatest tragedies ever experienced in the annals of human history.Of course, the most notorious aspect of this entire story is the fact that many of the survivors were forced to resort to cannibalism; and that part of the story isn't ignored.  But what the documentary also explores is the fact that so many of the men in that party perished, and that two-thirds of the women and children were able to make it out of there alive; that James Reed, who had been banished after having killed a teamster, found, much to his amazement, that his wife and four children had survived; and that nine snowstorms enveloped the mountains during that winter, hindering the fourth and final rescue party by an entire month.  Historians Joseph King, Wallace Stegner, Harold Schindler, and Donald Buck, also comment on what the saga can teach us about the limits of human experience and can-do American optimism, and how it can be tripped up, fatally in the case of the Donner Party, by not listening to sage advice being given by those who knew better, including James Clyman, the mountain man who had advised his old friend Reed to take the established path to California and not take Hastings' cut-off.What is most heartbreaking, of course, is that, when one comes down to it, the people in the Donner Party really weren't any different from us.  They knew nothing more about the virgin territory they were stepping off into than those whom they followed; and while in hindsight it's easy to say that they should not have trusted the bogus statements of Lansford Hastings, who is to say that we wouldn't have acted any differently if we had been in their shoes at that time?  This documentary poses that question, and many others, to us as we watch the tragic and horrifying saga unfold over a ninety-minute running time.  It is one of the greatest and most tragic sagas in our nation's history, and one that, without this documentary film, many people would probably still have a lot of the wrong ideas about.",5,"THE DONNER PARTY--Tragic, Shocking, Heartbreaking...And Much, Much More",1360108800,"02 6, 2013",2013,4117,"['PBS', 'long-running', 'documentary', 'series', 'American', 'Experience', 'had', 'provided', 'huge', 'mine', 'who', 'are', 'deeply', 'interested', 'country', 'rich', 'history', 'One', 'aspect', 'history', 'big', 'westward', 'migration', 'mid-19th', 'century', 'eventually', 'led', 'northwestern', 'part', 'what', 'was', 'once', 'Mexico', 'coming', 'American', 'control', 'stories', 'part', 'history', 'none', 'been', 'heartbreaking', 'poignant', 'shocking', 'Donner', 'Party', 'emigrant', 'wagon', 'train', 'several', 'fatal', 'mistakes', 'biggest', 'was', 'taking', 'cut-off', 'Utah', 'mountains', 'Great', 'Salt', 'Lake', 'Desert', 'found', 'stranded', 'harsh', 'winter', '1846-47', 'Sierra', 'Nevada', 'only', 'one', 'hundred', 'fifty', 'miles', 'short', 'final', 'goal', 'Sutter', 'Fort', 'Sacramento', 'California.As', 'documented', 'Ric', 'Burns', 'brother', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'THE', 'DONNER', 'PARTY', 'how', 'two', 'prominent', 'families', 'Springfield', 'Illinois', 'led', 'James', 'Reed', 'George', 'Donner', 'decided', 'make', 'long', '2500-mile', 'track', 'west', 'California', 'order', 'make', 'better', 'life', 'narration', 'David', 'McCullough', 'excerpts', 'diaries', 'read', 'people', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'Amy', 'Madigan', 'J.D', 'Cannon', 'others', 'get', 'sense', 'roughness', 'danger', 'cross-country', 'journey', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'dangerous', 'got', 'when', 'Reeds', 'Donners', 'made', 'catastrophic', 'mistake', 'listening', 'advice', 'ambitious', 'would-be', 'emperor', 'named', 'Lansford', 'Hastings', 'took', 'shortcut', 'rugged', 'terrain', 'could', 'only', 'be', 'accessible', 'horseback', 'certainly', 'not', 'wagon', 'party', 'lost', 'almost', 'entire', 'summer', 'making', 'dangerous', 'shortcut', 'actually', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'much', 'longer', 'much', 'more', 'treacherous', 'established', 'path', 'reached', 'foot', 'Sierras', 'last', 'week', 'October', 'what', 'was', 'thought', 'be', 'enough', 'time', 'left', 'cross', 'pass', 'would', 'eventually', 'be', 'named', 'unfortunately', 'got', 'caught', 'early', 'blizzard', 'losing', 'race', 'weather', 'one', 'single', 'day', 'What', 'happened', 'next', 'five', 'months', 'Sierras', 'one', 'greatest', 'tragedies', 'ever', 'experienced', 'annals', 'human', 'history.Of', 'course', 'most', 'notorious', 'aspect', 'entire', 'story', 'fact', 'many', 'survivors', 'were', 'forced', 'resort', 'cannibalism', 'part', 'story', ""n't"", 'ignored', 'what', 'documentary', 'also', 'fact', 'so', 'many', 'men', 'party', 'perished', 'two-thirds', 'women', 'children', 'were', 'able', 'make', 'alive', 'James', 'Reed', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'banished', 'having', 'killed', 'teamster', 'found', 'much', 'amazement', 'wife', 'four', 'children', 'had', 'survived', 'nine', 'snowstorms', 'enveloped', 'mountains', 'winter', 'hindering', 'fourth', 'final', 'rescue', 'party', 'entire', 'month', 'Historians', 'Joseph', 'King', 'Wallace', 'Stegner', 'Harold', 'Schindler', 'Donald', 'Buck', 'also', 'comment', 'what', 'saga', 'can', 'teach', 'limits', 'human', 'experience', 'can-do', 'American', 'optimism', 'how', 'can', 'be', 'tripped', 'up', 'fatally', 'case', 'Donner', 'Party', 'not', 'listening', 'sage', 'advice', 'being', 'given', 'who', 'knew', 'better', 'including', 'James', 'Clyman', 'mountain', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'advised', 'old', 'friend', 'Reed', 'take', 'established', 'path', 'California', 'not', 'take', 'Hastings', 'cut-off.What', 'most', 'heartbreaking', 'course', 'when', 'one', 'down', 'people', 'Donner', 'Party', 'really', 'were', ""n't"", 'different', 'knew', 'nothing', 'more', 'virgin', 'territory', 'were', 'stepping', 'off', 'whom', 'followed', 'hindsight', 'easy', 'say', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'trusted', 'bogus', 'statements', 'Lansford', 'Hastings', 'who', 'say', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'acted', 'differently', 'had', 'been', 'shoes', 'time', 'documentary', 'poses', 'question', 'many', 'others', 'watch', 'tragic', 'horrifying', 'saga', 'unfold', 'ninety-minute', 'running', 'time', 'one', 'greatest', 'most', 'tragic', 'sagas', 'nation', 'history', 'one', 'documentary', 'film', 'many', 'people', 'would', 'probably', 'still', 'have', 'lot', 'wrong', 'ideas']",American Experience - The Donner Party

Thanks PBS.In a way, we should consider ourselves lucky, for despite the atmosphere of anxiety and uncertainty that palgues the 21st century, our age offers us vast technological advances that makes life much easier in all aspects. Yet we do take so much for granted, for there was another time, a time of continious struggles to survive. The 1840s in the States was also, I would imagine a very exciting time, for along with the difficulties, there were dreams to seek a better life and fulfil them through uncharted and virgin territories, a vasteness that can devour as much as lead to 'eldorado'. The 'eldorado' in question was California, and emigrants way before the Gold Rush of the 1850s, rushed there to improve their lot and seek their fortunes.These people were really brave! To decide to leave the certainty of their established lives, and jump into the unknown needed a lot of courage! But it is this courage that made the emigrants of the Mayflower leave Plymouth, and it is this courage that made America the great power that it is today.The Donner party was one of the unlucky ones, who decided against the advise of a more experienced tracker,to take a shorter route to 'eldorado',a mistake that would cost most of them their lives, and would push some to the darkest recesses of the human soul.While many emigrants successfully made it to California and rebuild their lives and rewritten the country's history in the process, most are fogotten. The fate of Donner Party on the other hand is not, not only because most failed to reach their destination, but because of the horrors that they experienced trying.Ric Burns brilliantly captures this ill fated journey, through the letters of both the dead and few survivors (perfectly read with an errie tone), soundbites from historians (just a few), and beautiful cinematography that captures the beauty and hostility of the landscape. Brian Keane adds so much power with his gorgeous music.(I am still waiting for the soundtrack to be released, it is worth it!!!)You have to buy the Donner Party and look in awe and fascination at the courage of early emigrants, and in sheer terror at the tests that the human being is put under and the lenght that he/she will go to to survive.

I remember watching it on PBS when it aired and this DVD brought to mind also the book I had just recently read called Desperate Passage. While these are actors reading excerpts from various diaries and recollections of some of the survivors of the Donner Party it still seemed so real. You can't expect a 90-minute spexcial to go into the depth a long book can as to all that the early pioneers endured just reaching the passage leading over the Sierra Nevada Mountains in 1846, let alone what one terrible winter did to those holed up in cabins, lean-tos, or holes dug into the snow itself. Add to that the fearful conditions the four different rescue parties had to cope with just to reach the survivors, and you get an idea of what these humans perished from, and triumphed against. The weak, tired voices you listen to, and the somber music, make this a chilling retelling of this tragedy in our history. Just as an afterthought on the timeline, I read A Terrible Glory right after finisheing Desperate Passage and was interested to learn the Battle of Little Bighorn took place only 30 years later, in 1876.",4,A Testament to Human Strength,1257465600,"11 6, 2009",2009,1215,"['putting', 'title', 'Amazon', 'Wish', 'List', 'rented', 'Netflix', 'viewed', 'November', '5', 'remember', 'watching', 'PBS', 'when', 'aired', 'DVD', 'brought', 'mind', 'also', 'book', 'had', 'just', 'recently', 'read', 'called', 'Desperate', 'Passage', 'are', 'actors', 'reading', 'excerpts', 'various', 'diaries', 'recollections', 'survivors', 'Donner', 'Party', 'still', 'seemed', 'so', 'real', 'ca', ""n't"", 'expect', '90-minute', 'spexcial', 'go', 'depth', 'long', 'book', 'can', 'early', 'pioneers', 'endured', 'just', 'reaching', 'passage', 'leading', 'Sierra', 'Nevada', 'Mountains', '1846', 'let', 'alone', 'what', 'one', 'terrible', 'winter', 'did', 'holed', 'up', 'cabins', 'lean-tos', 'holes', 'dug', 'snow', 'Add', 'fearful', 'conditions', 'four', 'different', 'rescue', 'parties', 'had', 'cope', 'just', 'reach', 'survivors', 'get', 'idea', 'what', 'humans', 'perished', 'triumphed', 'weak', 'tired', 'voices', 'listen', 'somber', 'music', 'make', 'chilling', 'retelling', 'tragedy', 'history', 'Just', 'afterthought', 'timeline', 'read', 'Terrible', 'Glory', 'right', 'finisheing', 'Desperate', 'Passage', 'was', 'interested', 'learn', 'Battle', 'Little', 'Bighorn', 'took', 'place', 'only', '30', 'years', 'later', '1876']",American Experience - The Donner Party

I was riveted to my TV set from start to finish, the hour went by so quickly.  I later bought the VHS tape and recently got the DVD from Amazon.  The Burns brothers are excellent story tellers through their films and Ric Burns is just as much a master documentarian as his famous brother Ken.  The story of the Donner Party is haunting, their tragic ordeal seemed almost as if it was predestined.  This is one of the best documentaries ever made.  The movie has a 'you are there' feeling to it, the actors' voices sound believable and are well matched.  Even the music carries a sense of hopelessness and doom hanging like a dark shadow over the whole tale.  If you like watching history on film, you definiately want to see this one.  It lingers in your mind long afterwards and it might make you wonder what you would do if faced with similar awful circumstances.

They had no cake, wore no funny hats, sang no songs, tippled no champagne.  Rather, they set out on a long trek from Illinois to California and met with disaster.  If most people know anything about the group, they know simply that they were reduced to canibalism to stay alive.This video does an excellent job of describing the group and the perils they faced--including misrepresentations by a self-styled expert and the worst blizzard the California mountains ever experienced.  Not all were named Donner, despite the program title.  About half of them survived the ordeal and went on to become citizens of California.  The story is dramatic in the extreme--and that's where the fault lies, perhaps.  The facts alone were sufficient to claim the watcher's full attention, but the voices-over, in providing words from diaries and other accounts, almost whisper in an attempt to lend more drama to words that could have stood alone quite well.  And that's why four stars, not five.  The attempt to punch up the drama was annoying.
