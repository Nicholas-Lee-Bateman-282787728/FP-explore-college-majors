What compels people to admit things they may be sorry they told you?  And, in a world of unspeakable injustice, why does relatively meaningless behavior trouble so many people?  Writer-director Bobcat Goldthwait's SLEEPING DOG LIES raises those questions but leaves it up to the viewer to answer.I resist explaining the setup of SLEEPING DOGS LIE because it would be like giving away the conclusion about Rosebud to someone who has not seen CITIZEN KANE.  If you have yet to learn about the premise of SLEEPING DOGS LIE, I hope you'll avoid other reviews until after you watch this gem of a movie the public missed.  One contribution here criticizes this film's setup because instead of being about ""something that maybe one in a thousand women might try,"" it involves ""something one in a million might undertake,""  but I think this one-in-a-million scenario makes the challenge SLEEPING DOGS LIE presents that much stronger.The need to communicate, by definition, means taking the risk of being truthful to the point of revealing what others don't need to know.

1046613,A3GRN6J64F2C3X,B000MGUZD4,"Joseph P. Menta, Jr.","[7, 7]","""Sleeping Dogs Lie"" is not a bad little romantic comedy.  It's sort of in the vein of a Kevin Smith (""Chasing Amy"") or Judd Apatow (""Knocked Up"") movie: lots of gross, over-the-top humor which cleverly hides a fairly sweet story.  The movie probably would have done better, however, if the cute woman's big secret involved something that maybe one in a thousand women might try, as opposed to something one in a million might undertake.  The problem isn't so much that her big secret is gross and disgusting (though you won't find me making a strong defense that it isn't those things), but that it's goofily unbelievable.  At least for the character we get to know here.  But the movie's basically a goofy comedy, so goofy shouldn't be a deal breaker, right?The movie's bargain basement budget is somewhat apparent in the production values, though things never get close to shoddy looking.  In fact, the movie is generally well shot, acted, and lit, as well as sensitively directed.  There's a nice little soundtrack, too.  Definitely not bad for the twelve cents they had to spend.On DVD, ""Sleeping Dogs Lie"" features a solid picture and good sound.  The DVD also includes an interesting and often charming commentary track, rich with entertaining anecdotes, by writer/director Bobcat Goldthwait, and several trailers for other indie comedies.  No behind-the-scenes featurettes, however.Though ultimately taking a cynical view of the importance of complete honesty in a relationship (in fact, the message seems to be that you'll be walking into a minefield if you even try to be completely honest), ""Sleeping Dogs Lie"" is funny and moving, and a nice surprise to discover on DVD.",3,"Not bad, but probably not one to watch with mom or the kids",1228435200,"12 5, 2008",2008,1681,"['Sleeping', 'Dogs', 'Lie', 'not', 'bad', 'little', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'sort', 'vein', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'Chasing', 'Amy', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'movie', 'lots', 'gross', 'over-the-top', 'humor', 'cleverly', 'fairly', 'sweet', 'story', 'movie', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'however', 'cute', 'woman', 'big', 'secret', 'involved', 'something', 'maybe', 'one', 'thousand', 'women', 'might', 'try', 'opposed', 'something', 'one', 'million', 'might', 'undertake', 'problem', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'big', 'secret', 'gross', 'disgusting', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'making', 'strong', 'defense', ""n't"", 'things', 'goofily', 'unbelievable', 'least', 'character', 'get', 'know', 'here', 'movie', 'basically', 'goofy', 'comedy', 'goofy', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'deal', 'breaker', 'right', 'movie', 'bargain', 'basement', 'budget', 'somewhat', 'apparent', 'production', 'values', 'things', 'never', 'get', 'close', 'shoddy', 'looking', 'fact', 'movie', 'generally', 'well', 'shot', 'acted', 'lit', 'as', 'well', 'sensitively', 'directed', 'nice', 'little', 'soundtrack', 'too', 'Definitely', 'not', 'bad', 'twelve', 'cents', 'had', 'spend.On', 'DVD', 'Sleeping', 'Dogs', 'Lie', 'solid', 'picture', 'good', 'sound', 'DVD', 'also', 'interesting', 'often', 'charming', 'commentary', 'track', 'rich', 'entertaining', 'anecdotes', 'writer/director', 'Bobcat', 'Goldthwait', 'several', 'trailers', 'other', 'indie', 'comedies', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurettes', 'however.Though', 'ultimately', 'taking', 'cynical', 'view', 'importance', 'complete', 'honesty', 'relationship', 'fact', 'message', 'be', ""'ll"", 'be', 'walking', 'minefield', 'even', 'try', 'be', 'completely', 'honest', 'Sleeping', 'Dogs', 'Lie', 'funny', 'moving', 'nice', 'surprise', 'discover', 'DVD']",N/A
1046614,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B000MGUZD4,K. Driscoll,"[3, 4]","Sleeping Dogs Lie is a film written and directed by comedian Bobcat Goldthwait whose brand of comedy I've never found remotely appealing; but, I can certainly recognize the uniqueness and even moderate mainstream appeal of his personality.  Surprisingly, that is all negligible here because if I were to close my eyes and try really hard to imagine what a film directed and written by Goldthwait would look like, I would never have pictured this strangely funny and touching little film. Evidently, Goldthwait has some wonderful tricks up his sleeve.  Sleeping Dogs Lie is a short (only 87 minutes) low-budget independent film that was released in 2006 and got very little exposure. Only now did it finally come under my radar, and I always look for weird movies like this.A seemingly normal young woman named Amy seems to have something bothering her despite having a promising future and great potential.  Her fiance is perfect, and she is the true favorite among her siblings in the eyes of her conservative parents.  Her fiance wants to be as honest with her as possible, and after being encouraged to reveal all the possible skeletons in her closet, Amy tells her fiance her dark secret.  She impulsively and inexplicably performed fellatio on her dog when she was eighteen years old.  This revelation travels fast and shatters her existence entirely.My compliments to the performances here for understanding fully when the humor was intended and when to turn on the actual drama.  That is obviously a tremendous compliment to the film's director as well.  Melinda Page Hamilton as Amy is especially strong and has some truly great acting moments.  I couldn't help but be reminded of director Todd Solondz (Happiness,Palindromes,Storytelling) while watching this.  Solondz has an extremely dark sense of humor but in the moments when his stories are awkwardly dramatic it is often done to be further critical of his characters, as if to almost laugh at how pathetic they can actually get.  Goldthwait doesn't go there; he tells the story of this girl as if she is some kind of angel who simply made a terrible mistake that just happens to be so extreme we cannot help but laugh a little bit. Furthermore, to not only laugh at her mistake but also the way the issue destroys all the relationships in her life. Therein lies the diabolical humor.  I always say I feel guilty watching movies like this and maybe I should.  By the film's conclusion I did feel much more rewarded then I might after one of Solondz movies.  Despite the dark subject matter, Sleeping Dogs Lie is unique, funny, and has surprisingly authentic and sensitive moments.",4,Dark Humor with a Strong Dramatic Overtone,1239580800,"04 13, 2009",2009,2644,"['Sleeping', 'Dogs', 'Lie', 'film', 'written', 'directed', 'comedian', 'Bobcat', 'Goldthwait', 'brand', 'comedy', ""'ve"", 'never', 'found', 'remotely', 'appealing', 'can', 'certainly', 'recognize', 'uniqueness', 'even', 'moderate', 'mainstream', 'appeal', 'personality', 'Surprisingly', 'negligible', 'here', 'were', 'close', 'eyes', 'try', 'really', 'hard', 'imagine', 'what', 'film', 'directed', 'written', 'Goldthwait', 'would', 'look', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'pictured', 'strangely', 'funny', 'touching', 'little', 'film', 'Evidently', 'Goldthwait', 'wonderful', 'up', 'sleeve', 'Sleeping', 'Dogs', 'Lie', 'short', 'only', '87', 'minutes', 'low-budget', 'independent', 'film', 'was', 'released', '2006', 'got', 'very', 'little', 'exposure', 'Only', 'now', 'did', 'finally', 'come', 'radar', 'always', 'look', 'weird', 'movies', 'this.A', 'seemingly', 'normal', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Amy', 'have', 'something', 'bothering', 'having', 'promising', 'future', 'great', 'potential', 'fiance', 'perfect', 'true', 'favorite', 'siblings', 'eyes', 'conservative', 'parents', 'fiance', 'be', 'honest', 'possible', 'being', 'encouraged', 'reveal', 'possible', 'skeletons', 'closet', 'Amy', 'fiance', 'dark', 'secret', 'impulsively', 'inexplicably', 'performed', 'fellatio', 'dog', 'when', 'was', 'eighteen', 'years', 'old', 'revelation', 'fast', 'existence', 'entirely.My', 'compliments', 'performances', 'here', 'understanding', 'fully', 'when', 'humor', 'was', 'intended', 'when', 'turn', 'actual', 'drama', 'obviously', 'tremendous', 'compliment', 'film', 'director', 'as', 'well', 'Melinda', 'Page', 'Hamilton', 'Amy', 'especially', 'strong', 'truly', 'great', 'acting', 'moments', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'reminded', 'director', 'Todd', 'Solondz', 'Happiness', 'Palindromes', 'Storytelling', 'watching', 'Solondz', 'extremely', 'dark', 'sense', 'humor', 'moments', 'when', 'stories', 'are', 'awkwardly', 'dramatic', 'often', 'done', 'be', 'further', 'critical', 'characters', 'almost', 'laugh', 'how', 'pathetic', 'can', 'actually', 'get', 'Goldthwait', ""n't"", 'go', 'there', 'story', 'girl', 'kind', 'angel', 'who', 'simply', 'made', 'terrible', 'mistake', 'just', 'be', 'so', 'extreme', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'little', 'bit', 'Furthermore', 'not', 'only', 'laugh', 'mistake', 'also', 'way', 'issue', 'relationships', 'life', 'Therein', 'diabolical', 'humor', 'always', 'say', 'feel', 'guilty', 'watching', 'movies', 'maybe', 'should', 'film', 'conclusion', 'did', 'feel', 'much', 'more', 'rewarded', 'then', 'might', 'one', 'Solondz', 'movies', 'dark', 'subject', 'matter', 'Sleeping', 'Dogs', 'Lie', 'unique', 'funny', 'surprisingly', 'authentic', 'sensitive', 'moments']",N/A

Amy wants to tell him since he has bared his soul to her and she doesn't want there to be any secrets between them but she's afraid he'll be disgusted.

NOT what you would expect from the guy who was Gang Leader and Officer Zed in the Police Academy movies. He truly has some amazing talent and it shows with this very touching film. It tells a story of a girl that had done something in her past that she should never have opened up to anybody about and what happens when she did. Everyone has some secret or secrets in their lives that should go to their graves with them. That is why they are secrets. But when you open them up to your so called family and friends these secrets can be devistating and thought of as unforgivable but then again that is why there is a past and you shouldn't let them linger in the present and future. Some secrets are just better forgotten rather than remmembered as you will see in this touching film. Totally not what I was expecting coming from Bobcat espcially in the first 10 to 15 minutes of the film (which was done VERY TASTEFULLY may I add.).
