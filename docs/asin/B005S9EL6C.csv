1500295,A3B1V3AUUV13R6,B005S9EL6C,Adrien Caldwell,"[2, 3]","I saw previews of this movie from other DVDs that I rented and what I saw in the preview looked great. However when I rented the movie there was something off with the visual component to all the dance sequences. I have very sharp and good vision and my eyes started to hurt a bit while watching these dance moves. At times I felt like something was a bit out of focus or ""jagged."" At times I often said to myself, ""Hym, the camera angle used to capture these dancers while doing their moves was suboptimal at best. They're really not being captured in the best angle to really show them off."" However, I learned later that this movie was originally meant for a 3D viewing experience at the cinema. So my guess is that this is why my eyes were picking up on something odd and maybe this movie would be more impressive visually while watching as a 3D experience.The acting was decent but the story line was the same regurgitated theme we've all seen so many times before. Young talented people living a hard life now have their turf threatened in some way and eventually collaborate together to fight for what's theirs through dance. It's such a cliche story line we've seen so many times already. After the first Footloose in 1984, the remake of Footloose in 2011 and finally the first ""Step UP"" in 2006 with Channing Tatum, I don't how or why directors and producers find any value in repeating the same old story.",2,Left me disappointed....,1355011200,"12 9, 2012",2012,1415,"['saw', 'previews', 'movie', 'other', 'DVDs', 'rented', 'what', 'saw', 'preview', 'looked', 'great', 'However', 'when', 'rented', 'movie', 'was', 'something', 'off', 'visual', 'component', 'dance', 'sequences', 'have', 'very', 'sharp', 'good', 'vision', 'eyes', 'started', 'hurt', 'bit', 'watching', 'dance', 'moves', 'times', 'felt', 'something', 'was', 'bit', 'focus', 'jagged', 'times', 'often', 'said', 'myself', 'Hym', 'camera', 'angle', 'used', 'capture', 'dancers', 'doing', 'moves', 'was', 'suboptimal', 'best', ""'re"", 'really', 'not', 'being', 'captured', 'best', 'angle', 'really', 'show', 'off', 'However', 'learned', 'later', 'movie', 'was', 'originally', 'meant', '3D', 'viewing', 'experience', 'cinema', 'guess', 'why', 'eyes', 'were', 'picking', 'up', 'something', 'odd', 'maybe', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'impressive', 'visually', 'while', 'watching', '3D', 'experience.The', 'acting', 'was', 'decent', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'same', 'regurgitated', 'theme', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'Young', 'talented', 'people', 'living', 'hard', 'life', 'now', 'have', 'turf', 'threatened', 'way', 'eventually', 'collaborate', 'together', 'fight', 'what', 'dance', 'such', 'cliche', 'story', 'line', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'already', 'first', 'Footloose', '1984', 'remake', 'Footloose', '2011', 'finally', 'first', 'Step', 'UP', '2006', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'do', ""n't"", 'how', 'why', 'directors', 'producers', 'find', 'value', 'repeating', 'same', 'old', 'story']",Step Up Revolution

The dances were really great and i would seriously be so excited whenever a new dance was about to start and my adrenaline would start racing and i couldn't like stop watching I just wanted them to keep doing dances. The movie was really great and I loved it and it made me watch the other movies as well. Seriously go see this movie whether or not you have or have not seen the past movies.

1500302,A2GEG8O4FBR9DK,B005S9EL6C,Brian James,"[0, 1]","If you're going to pay extra for any 3D movie, this should be the one!  This has the best 3D + clarity that I have ever seen in a movie.  This movie looks like it was shot in 3D.  Unlike Thor and Captain America which were shot in 2D and then edited to 3D, this movie looks like it was shot in 3D.  There's a difference, when I watched Captain America, the 3D wasn't all that great, and reviews pointed out flaws like the 3D wasn't constant throughout, it was added to select parts in each seen.  This movie kept up with the technology and took it further.  As for the clarity, well a lot of 3D movies will pixelate the background in order to make their 2D seem more 3D after editing.  The movie showed great clarity and 3D at the same time and when I paused it at intermissions the 3D and clarity were very noticeable and amazing to see.  This is a test that many published articles and reviewers are saying you should do to test the true quality of the 3D, and the same can be done for clarity.  As for the audio, well you can image that it would be great for a movie like this, after all the music is a vital aspect of their movies.  Using a 300 watt Polk subwoofer for the low bass and a secondary 100 watt Sony subwoofer for the higher frequency bass (the ""punchy"" bass) coupled with 3 - 100 watt bass shakers on the bottom of the couch and wall mounted surround sound, the music and special effects sounded amazing.  For anyone who wants to take it further, the next step after 3D would be bass shakers on the bottom of your seat so you can feel the bass like you would in the movies, this really brought the movie to life! These movies really keep up with the times, new innovative dance moves, now more realistic with the best 3D technology currently on the market (for 2012), new/current music and the best audio and video (clarity) quality above and beyond the standard of current movies.

1500320,A2SQJPUCZNHMZE,B005S9EL6C,"Geraldine Ahearn ""Author Geri Ahearn""","[17, 21]","'Step-Up-Revolution' reminded me very much of the Amazing Performance I admired in 'West Side Story.' Both showings have a Good theme. Also, I felt that the dancing was as Professional and Addicting as much as it was in 'Dirty Dancing.' The Music in this movie was Breathtaking and the Acting Performance Excellent. The theme here is the Dancer's life. Emily arrives in Miami to fulfill her dream of becoming a professional dancer as she falls in love with Sean. Her soul-mate leads a dance crew called 'The Mob.' After The Mob's neighborhood is threatened, Emily, Sean, and The Mob join together to turn Performance Art into Protest Art as they risk losing their dreams to fight for a Greater cause. I had flashbacks about the Protest I viewed in 'West Side Story.' Even the Last Dance in 'Dirty Dancing' wasn't just symbolic of love, it was also a Protest dance to show the world how strong they believed as they united to send a message.

I tried to do the Cabbage Patch one time and got a nose bleed. But I do love me the Step Up movies; they're some of my guilty pleasures. STEP UP REVOLUTION places fourth in the franchise, and while I wasn't sure I'd be into it, maybe because it forgoes the dance contest theme, it turns out, there's a different but equally absorbing competition taking place.The city of Miami is being rocked by a series of flash mobs performed by a mysterious dance crew styling itself ""The Mob."" The news and social medias are quick to latch on to this phenomenon, and soon The Mob has gone viral and become the talk of the town.21-year-old Emily (Kathryn McCormick) arrives in Miami, determined to pursue her dream of becoming a professional dancer. Informed by a prestigious dance academy that her technique lacks passion, she's drawn to Sean (Ryan Guzman), a waiter and street dancer and co-founder of - yes, you guessed it - The Mob. Out comes The Mob's motivation: YouTube has launched a contest in which the first YouTube channel to receive ten million hits is awarded the prize of $100,000. At present, The Mob is in second place, behind some singing cat.But then the narrative introduces a bigger picture as a real estate magnate (Peter Gallagher) threatens to tear down Sean's historic waterfront neighborhood. Can The Mob's protest dances rally the beleaguered community and influence the land developer? Can they win the YouTube contest? Will the Winwood Dance Academy think better of Emily's technique and select her as a student? And where the hell can I get a clip of that singing cat?If you accept that this film stands by its STEP UP formula, that it limits itself to by-the-numbers storytelling, then you'll have massive fun watching this. Don't anticipate the two leads to be acting prodigies. Kathryn McCormick comes from a professional dancing background and had never acted before, and I think she's swell. Ryan Guzman was a model and had dabbled in acting, but had never danced before. The important thing to me is that what they do here seems to come from the heart. It's enough for me that they look good and have chemistry together and that their dancing is top notch. Ryan is phenomenal, given that he'd never danced before. But it wasn't until the scene when he was teaching his cute little niece the ""Ocean, Motion"" move that I decided I liked his character. It's a really sweet scene. Later, I tried doing the ""Ocean, Motion,"" and, yep, nose bleed.The choreographers try their dang best to impress you. The flash mob sequences are amazing, striking stuff, particularly the sequences at the art gallery, at the restaurant, and at the council meeting (my favorite). Keeping up with tradition, Stephen ""tWitch"" Boss provides the thru line, returning as ""Jason."" And, of course, when the big finale requires extra dancers, Jason doesn't hesitate to reach out to his old crew from STEP UP 3D. So expect cameo appearances from a few STEP UP favorites. The flash mob finale at the shipyard throws everything at you. It incorporates several props and culminates in a moving duet between McCormick and Guzman.

This along with the other Step Up movies always leave me feeling satisfied, happy, pumped up and itching to pull a hamstring learning how to slam dance.Miami crew The Mob is trying to drum up 10 million YouTube hits with their filmed flash mob hip hop routines done in public.  Of course they all have crappy jobs, douche-y bosses, and could really use a break.  The movie  is predictably formulaic, but that's okay.  The rebellious crew captain meets a rebellious young lady who, of course, also dances quite well and in a different style.  Finances grow tighter.  Douche bags become douchier.  The love interest becomes complicated by the pressure of a powerful father's (Peter Gallagher) ultimatum.  The girl is challenged to risk everything.  The Mob puts ""it all"" on the line.Together Sean (Ryan Guzman in his first movie) and Emily (SYTYCD's Kathryn, who looks a lot like Eliza Dushku) mix his hip hop street savvy with her contemporary style.  Born two worlds apart, but they're one of a kind..yeah, it's that kind of ""rule-breaking"" hip flick.  He says things like ""trust me"" and ""meet me here at this time...and wear something nice.""  How mysterious and romantic, right?  He wins her romantic passion by introducing her to his life's passion: hip hop flash mobbing.The movie is shot well with vibrant colors bringing Miami to life.  The music is fun.  The dancing is exciting.  The flash mob set ups are cool, too.  I especially enjoyed the art gallery scene, during which many dance and lighting styles were showcased.  Even parkour (freerunning) finds its way into this movie.There's trampoline dancing, devil stick dancing, martial arts dancing, parkour, contemporary, girl crew booty shaking, hip hop, stop-motion robotics, a dash of krump, un poco de salsa...pretty much everything.  Oh, and the best twitchy robot dancer EVER (Vlad from Step Up 3D) makes an appearance in the finale.  Good stuff!  I seriously can't tell if they're modifying the film speed or if he can really move like that.  Jenny Kido and Moose (both from Step Up 2 and Step Up 3D) make appearances, too.  Surprises abound left and right.  And, no.  I didn't ruin anything for you.These actors are nothing amazing, but they don't drown in the sea of clich&eacute;s and destitute writing.  They hold their own just strong enough to keep my attention and earn a few grins as I patiently wait for the next dance scene.  The movie also features So You Think You Can Dance's Twitch (who is wisely given very few lines as Jason) (Step Up 3D, Stomp the Yard 2) and Mia Michaels basically playing herself.This movie is 90 minutes of feel good, stickin'-it-to-the-man fun that reminds me of how exciting life was in my early 20s and late teens.",5,"These Step Up movies always leave me feeling satisfied, pumped up and itching to pull a hamstring learning how to slam dance!",1357084800,"01 2, 2013",2013,2876,"['flick', 'echelons', 'Got', 'Served', 'Beat', 'World', '2011', 'original', 'Got', 'Served', '2004', 'Step', 'Up', 'franchise', 'other', 'Step', 'Up', 'movies', 'always', 'leave', 'feeling', 'satisfied', 'happy', 'pumped', 'up', 'itching', 'pull', 'hamstring', 'learning', 'how', 'slam', 'dance.Miami', 'crew', 'Mob', 'trying', 'drum', 'up', '10', 'million', 'YouTube', 'hits', 'filmed', 'flash', 'mob', 'hip', 'hop', 'done', 'public', 'course', 'have', 'crappy', 'jobs', 'douche-y', 'bosses', 'could', 'really', 'use', 'break', 'movie', 'predictably', 'formulaic', 'okay', 'rebellious', 'crew', 'captain', 'rebellious', 'young', 'lady', 'who', 'course', 'also', 'quite', 'well', 'different', 'style', 'Finances', 'grow', 'tighter', 'Douche', 'become', 'douchier', 'love', 'interest', 'becomes', 'complicated', 'pressure', 'powerful', 'father', 'Peter', 'Gallagher', 'ultimatum', 'girl', 'challenged', 'risk', 'everything', 'Mob', 'line.Together', 'Sean', 'Ryan', 'Guzman', 'first', 'movie', 'Emily', 'SYTYCD', 'Kathryn', 'who', 'lot', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'mix', 'hip', 'hop', 'street', 'savvy', 'contemporary', 'style', 'Born', 'two', 'worlds', 'apart', ""'re"", 'one', 'kind..yeah', 'kind', 'rule-breaking', 'hip', 'flick', 'things', 'trust', 'meet', 'here', 'time', 'wear', 'something', 'nice', 'How', 'mysterious', 'romantic', 'right', 'romantic', 'passion', 'introducing', 'life', 'passion', 'hip', 'hop', 'flash', 'mobbing.The', 'movie', 'shot', 'well', 'vibrant', 'colors', 'bringing', 'Miami', 'life', 'music', 'fun', 'dancing', 'exciting', 'flash', 'mob', 'set', 'ups', 'are', 'cool', 'too', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'art', 'gallery', 'scene', 'many', 'dance', 'lighting', 'styles', 'were', 'showcased', 'Even', 'parkour', 'freerunning', 'way', 'trampoline', 'dancing', 'devil', 'stick', 'dancing', 'martial', 'arts', 'dancing', 'parkour', 'contemporary', 'girl', 'crew', 'booty', 'shaking', 'hip', 'hop', 'stop-motion', 'robotics', 'dash', 'krump', 'un', 'poco', 'salsa', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'Oh', 'best', 'twitchy', 'robot', 'dancer', 'EVER', 'Vlad', 'Step', 'Up', '3D', 'appearance', 'finale', 'Good', 'stuff', 'seriously', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', ""'re"", 'modifying', 'film', 'speed', 'can', 'really', 'move', 'Jenny', 'Kido', 'Moose', 'Step', 'Up', '2', 'Step', 'Up', '3D', 'make', 'appearances', 'too', 'Surprises', 'abound', 'left', 'right', 'did', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'anything', 'you.These', 'actors', 'are', 'nothing', 'amazing', 'do', ""n't"", 'drown', 'sea', 'clich', 'eacute', 'destitute', 'writing', 'hold', 'own', 'just', 'strong', 'enough', 'keep', 'attention', 'earn', 'few', 'grins', 'patiently', 'wait', 'next', 'dance', 'scene', 'movie', 'also', 'So', 'Think', 'Can', 'Dance', 'Twitch', 'who', 'wisely', 'given', 'very', 'few', 'lines', 'Jason', 'Step', 'Up', '3D', 'Stomp', 'Yard', '2', 'Mia', 'Michaels', 'basically', 'playing', 'herself.This', 'movie', '90', 'minutes', 'feel', 'good', ""stickin'-it-to-the-man"", 'fun', 'how', 'exciting', 'life', 'was', 'early', '20s', 'late', 'teens']",Step Up Revolution

Guy works at dead end job with little ambition, contest to raise money motivates him and his dance crew, he meets a girl (boss' daughter), they dance together and work towards and end goal. That sums up about 99% of the movie, which is like almost every other dance move.The dance sequences are by far the best part. They are well choreographed and the camera work is spectacular.

1500350,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B005S9EL6C,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","I'm coming into the whole STEP UP scene further down the line than I'd like to admit. This is the first movie in the series that I've actually watched. From what I've been able to look up this is either the fourth film in the series. If they have all been like this then they're entertaining enough but nothing spectacular.This time around we have a group of young people who love to dance and are seeking to win a competition for flash mob dancing being sponsored on the internet. For those who don't know a flash mob involves a group of people who prepare for a dance performance but don't have a stage to perform on. Instead they show up unannounced with no warning and suddenly you have a group of people burst into dance in everyday settings. When the film opens the group stop traffic on a coastal Miami street, pop up their sound equipment in seconds and begin dancing on top of, around and over cars in the street. Timed to make sure they can get away without being caught, the break down and take off.The leader of the crew is Eddy. Not professionally trained, Eddy works at a local hotel along with several other members of the crew. Their current goal is to get more hits for their street performance than any other crew and to win a large cash award and contract via the competition sponsored online.While on break at the hotel Eddy meets a young girl named Penelope who has some dance moves of her own. What he doesn't know is that her father is the owner of the hotel. Not only do we have a boy from the wrong side of the tracks meets girl who lives in posh surroundings here, we have another problem when Penelope's father releases the news that he intends to buy out the neighborhood where Eddy and his friends live to turn it into a resort area.Love will conquer all though. Even the problems that pop up when Eddy's best friend nearly ruins the potential for the crew to win the competition when he becomes jealous of Penelope. What he doesn't realize is that she's on their side and that the time she's been spending with Eddy was to help her realize her dream of performing with a high profile dance troupe there in Miami. Sure it lead to romance but there was no plan to harm the crew.While this set up may sound simple that's because in effect it is simple. The story is small and the dialogue weak but that's not what people going to see the STEP UP films are there for. They're there to watch the young dancers spin, jump, pop up and krunk in various settings Its all about dancing and watching some talented people do it to the best of their ability. The plotlines here are no more in depth than the old Mickey Rooney/Judy Garland ""hey kids let's put on a show!"" plots. Its all about the dancing.That's not to say it's a bad movie. It's actually quite entertaining. The dancing is well done and the music will have you toe tapping in seconds. No, this is not a movie that I would mark my calendar to go see, but as a rental for a night that will entertain, especially those who are dance fans, you can't go wrong with this one.",3,DANCING IN THE STREETS,1357776000,"01 10, 2013",2013,3052,"[""'m"", 'coming', 'whole', 'STEP', 'UP', 'scene', 'further', 'down', 'line', ""'d"", 'like', 'admit', 'first', 'movie', 'series', ""'ve"", 'actually', 'watched', 'what', ""'ve"", 'been', 'able', 'look', 'up', 'fourth', 'film', 'series', 'have', 'been', 'then', ""'re"", 'entertaining', 'enough', 'nothing', 'spectacular.This', 'time', 'have', 'group', 'young', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'dance', 'are', 'seeking', 'win', 'competition', 'flash', 'mob', 'dancing', 'being', 'sponsored', 'internet', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'flash', 'mob', 'group', 'people', 'who', 'prepare', 'dance', 'performance', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'stage', 'perform', 'Instead', 'show', 'up', 'unannounced', 'warning', 'suddenly', 'have', 'group', 'people', 'burst', 'dance', 'everyday', 'settings', 'When', 'film', 'group', 'stop', 'traffic', 'coastal', 'Miami', 'street', 'pop', 'up', 'sound', 'equipment', 'seconds', 'begin', 'dancing', 'top', 'cars', 'street', 'Timed', 'make', 'sure', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'being', 'caught', 'break', 'down', 'take', 'off.The', 'leader', 'crew', 'Eddy', 'Not', 'professionally', 'trained', 'Eddy', 'local', 'hotel', 'several', 'other', 'members', 'crew', 'current', 'goal', 'get', 'more', 'hits', 'street', 'performance', 'other', 'crew', 'win', 'large', 'cash', 'award', 'contract', 'competition', 'sponsored', 'online.While', 'break', 'hotel', 'Eddy', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Penelope', 'who', 'dance', 'moves', 'own', 'What', ""n't"", 'know', 'father', 'owner', 'hotel', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'have', 'boy', 'wrong', 'side', 'tracks', 'meets', 'girl', 'who', 'posh', 'surroundings', 'here', 'have', 'problem', 'when', 'Penelope', 'father', 'news', 'buy', 'out', 'neighborhood', 'where', 'Eddy', 'friends', 'live', 'turn', 'resort', 'area.Love', 'will', 'conquer', 'Even', 'problems', 'pop', 'up', 'when', 'Eddy', 'best', 'friend', 'nearly', 'potential', 'crew', 'win', 'competition', 'when', 'jealous', 'Penelope', 'What', ""n't"", 'realize', 'side', 'time', 'been', 'spending', 'Eddy', 'was', 'help', 'realize', 'dream', 'performing', 'high', 'profile', 'dance', 'troupe', 'there', 'Miami', 'Sure', 'lead', 'romance', 'was', 'plan', 'harm', 'crew.While', 'set', 'up', 'may', 'sound', 'simple', 'because', 'effect', 'simple', 'story', 'small', 'dialogue', 'weak', 'not', 'what', 'people', 'going', 'see', 'STEP', 'UP', 'films', 'are', 'there', ""'re"", 'watch', 'young', 'dancers', 'spin', 'jump', 'pop', 'up', 'krunk', 'various', 'settings', 'dancing', 'watching', 'talented', 'people', 'do', 'best', 'ability', 'plotlines', 'here', 'are', 'more', 'depth', 'old', 'Mickey', 'Rooney/Judy', 'Garland', 'hey', 'kids', 'let', 'put', 'show', 'plots', 'dancing.That', 'not', 'say', 'bad', 'movie', 'actually', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'dancing', 'well', 'done', 'music', 'will', 'have', 'toe', 'tapping', 'seconds', 'No', 'not', 'movie', 'would', 'mark', 'calendar', 'go', 'see', 'rental', 'night', 'will', 'entertain', 'especially', 'who', 'are', 'dance', 'fans', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'one']",Step Up Revolution

1500376,A2A1HXFSAPA9A5,B005S9EL6C,S. Der,"[5, 11]","This is the latest Step Up movie and it has taken a whole new showcase for dancing talent. There are no more school performances. No more battles. No more dance competition?!?! What do we have now? We have flash mobs!!! (A group of people dancing at random places and times.)The main story is the same as the last 3 movies - boy meets girl and falls in love. And that's fine, that's what Step Up is with dancing. I felt that they needed to build up the characters even more for people to really care about them. The love interest wasn't that interesting to me. At the end, I didn't care if the guy and girl got back together either way. They needed to show the people why they really needed to be together. All we saw was that they like to flirt around with each other. They like dancing with each other. They both are into The Mob. But...does that really mean they needed to be together? I said, not really. I see attraction. I see lust. And, even affection. But, I don't see love.  So, they needed to develop the characters even more and replace it with less dancing.I thought the dancing was great at first, but after watching it about 3/4 of the movie, I realized there are way too much dancing! It's so repetitive! Since there's no dance competition in the movie, I just saw the same dancers over and over again. Sure, they are dancing different songs, doing different moves, and have different themes, but it still fails to keep my interest. Too much can be a bad thing too and this is an example of too much dancing! Even during the movie, they said it themselves, ""the only way they know how to expressed ourselves is withhhhhh...dancing! All I thought was ""OMG, NOT AGAIN!"" ""Oh HELL NO!"" ""Here we go again.""Again, they should really develop the characters more. Why should I give a damn, if I don't really know much about them? Oh, just because the movie said show me a bit of something, doesn't mean I'm going to really go along with that idea. I don't think so!!!The music. They really could had used better music. I only liked the first and last few songs. The rest of the songs, I didn't care for.You don't need to watch this movie in 3D. This movie is fine in 2D because it's just not that good. The 3D effects just is an extra additional part, but won't make it any better than previous Step Ups.In this Step Up movie, they do like they always do by trying to connect the last Step Up movie somehow. This was done by having Twiitch in the movie and a few other dancers did a cameo from the last movies. I believe they should not have done it this way and actually used one or two more previous dancers and make a movie with them in it. Maybe the previous dancers all could had build up a story where they wanted to now do Flash mobs and that's how come we are now seeing this new direction, but nooo it's not like that. We just got introduced to a few new faces that I just didn't connect with and hated them.But don't get me wrong. I love Step Up movies! The first three movies were amazing great! And still, my favorite Step Up movie is the 3rd movie! That one was so well done with all the characters, story line, music, and dancing. Maybe it was so well done that every Step Up movie that will follow it will always do bad because they can never match up to greatest. Yet, another reason why, this 4th movie wasn't as good.Final thoughts, I think people should save their money. This movie is only worth renting.
