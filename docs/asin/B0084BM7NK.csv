One of the reasons is to reconnect with Jonathan, his ex-boyfriend who was deeply devoted to him, at a time Troy was likely too immature to handle a commitment like that. Jonathan is now in a relationship with the sexy Raul, who thinks it is nice that Jonathan can see his old friend, but that feeling changes when it seems that Jonathan is still attracted to Troy.This is a beautiful, sexy film, capably acted by a great cast.  The only problems I have with it are technical:  some choppy film editing, background music that overtakes the dialogue, and a director who seems to be addicted to unnecessary extended solo scenes of a characters silently staring off into space.

1545915,A25L1GQF65K55K,B0084BM7NK,Craig Haynes,"[9, 9]","""August"" is actually based on, as far as I know, a short film (Postmortem), by the same film director Eldar Rapaport. I have often wished that certain short films would indeed go on to develop characters and take the story to a place that is often-- in the short film context-- only intimated, suggested or simply left to the imagination of the viewer. Interestingly, Postmortem (the short), lends itself to a fuller treatment and I think for the most part, it works well.  Here in ""August"" we get the characters fleshed-out in all their full ""lack of character"" beauty. These guys not only have feet of clay, but hearts and brains of putty. It is such a cliche. Good-looking guy, who can have anyone he wants is beginning to age and reflects on a life of no commitment. He lands on the one person who really loved him and whom he 5 years ago turned-away. Back in LA from Spain, he shows up, out of the blue to rekindle the flame, even though the man of his intent is in another relationship that is really complicated by his status in this country as a legal alien. This part of the story is very rich and involves other interesting characters all intertwined beautifully by honest, real emotions, concerns and dreams. I loved how the film ends. It was real, not phony and packs a real punch for all those folks out there, who just don't take relationships seriously or when they finally do, it's too late. What really matters is a person's character and commitment.

I guess actors have learned how to appear sincere by tearing up; great technique, guys.  This movie tries to treat such decorator affects as dignified and serious, but only shows how vapid they really are. ""August"" has a lot of heart and sincerity and attractive actors, but is important because of its naive, direct depiction of the emptiness papered over with superficiality that is gay love as movies often portray it.The only character in the movie with any verbally expressible sense is Troy's straight brother Josh, who correctly diagnoses Troy as a shallow manipulator messing with other people's lives.  The opening scene in which Troy is subjected to a job interview makes it very clear that Troy is a fraud.  The question is, why does Jonathan love Troy to the extent of risking his relationship with sober and gorgeous Raoul?  The made for TV answer is that Jonathan aspires to be like Troy, as Troy is some one who does ""not give a s..t"".  Troy has nothing to offer Jonathan except his solid looks and manifest insincerity .The clincher: (spoiler alert) Raoul proves his love for spineless Jonathan by making love to both Jonathan and Troy, revealing Troy as the cad he is, and driving Troy out of the country.

Written and directed by Eldar Rapaport (with Brian Sloan) this is a hard look at love relationships and how the test of time influences the success or failure of commitment. The choice of title reflects the generated heat of contentious relationships and just happens to be set in the time of the infamous Station Fire in Southern California in 2009, the largest and deadliest of the multiple wildfires, burning 160,577 acres (or 251 square miles), destroying countless homes, and killing two firefighters - a time when the Los Angeles basin was without electricity, full of smoke and ashes, and all nerves were on edge regarding the carnage.Jonathan (Daniel Dugan) and Raul (Adrian Gonzalez) are a contented couple: though they live separately (Raul has married Jonathan's best friend Nina - Hilary Banks - for immigration purposes so they must maintain separate homes) they are devoted to each other and Raul is in the process of planning Jonathan's 30th birthday party. As an unexpected development Troy (Murray Bartlett), Jonathan's ex-boyfriend who has been living in Spain for several years after a painful breakup, arrives in Los Angeles at the height of the heat wave and moves in with his married brother Sean (Bernhard Forcher) and family. Troy calls Jonathan, arranges a meeting for coffee but is sure that Raul will enter the coffee shop to demonstrate the Jonathan is in a committed relationship. But old flames simmer and soon Troy is convincing the not unwilling Jonathan to rekindle their old passion, a liaison that becomes apparent to Raul. At Jonathan's 30th birthday party Nina and her chef boyfriend Nick (Mike Vaughn) invite Troy and Troy's good friend Devon (Brad Standley), and by the end of the evening the group hits the bars to smoke pot and drink.  Raul then invites Troy to their home to join Jonathan and him in a physical liaison that results in Troy's `wakeup call' about commitment as he sees the degree of passion between Raul and Jonathan: Troy as an outsider steps away and eventually returns to Spain - but we never know what will occur next.AUGUST is blessed with a very fine cast of excellent actors who are able to pull off the intimacy of the story with decorum.  There are some problems with the film: the director loses the audience with what feels like inadvertent non-linear storyline that disrupts the flow of the story, and the editor of the film David Au has cut and spliced the film in a disturbing and distracting manner. The musical score by Yuval Ron is heated Middle Eastern in flavor and at times covers the dialogue. But the story works in large part because of the exceptional acting and appeal of Murray Bartlett, Daniel Dugan, and Adrian Gonzalez.  As the PR states, ` It is an irresistible gay romantic drama!

Then there's the dry acting from all involved, as well as presenting LA in a really dull if semi-realistic way. The heat wave in the film only makes the whole affair uncomfortable, as opposed to hot.

The only thing is the plot of this movie seems to be the plot of several movies in the gay film genre.The main character in the film is in a relationship with another man who is married for citizenship purposes only.

He does not realize that the primary character is emotionally involved with the other man. You can guess what happens in the end ( no pun intended). Basically the guy from Spain goes home after causing problems and that pretty much sums up the movie. I don't want to tell to much and spoil this for someone who wants to see the movie. Others may think it is five star worthy, but it was just average to me.I would recommend this movie to the audience that would enjoy gay cinema.

1545930,A18P0T2NZTGWYX,B0084BM7NK,J. Martin,"[7, 9]","Jonathan, a shortish, homely-ish, 29-year-old, minimally employed nebbish in LA, has a tall, gorgeous (but shallow and manipulative), 40-ish ex-boyfriend, Troy - who dumped him five years earlier but for some reason has moved back from Barcelona just to get him back. BUT... Jonathan has an even MORE gorgeous (breathtakingly gorgeous) twentysomething current boyfriend, Raul - who is not only gorgeous but sweet, strong, sincere and totally devoted to him. Right away you say to yourself, this is just like real life, just like me and the two incredible hunks who can't get enough of me. What's a homely nebbish girl to do? That's the dilemma in this movie that I really wanted to hate but can't.It's the actors' fault: they're very, very good - TOO good for this unbelievable story. Unfortunately, the weakest actor is the one playing Jonathan, who brings no sensuality or charisma or other hot quality to the role to compensate for his nebbishy homeliness and explain WHY the two hunks are so irresistibly attracted to him.He was much more believable in Postmortem, the short this movie is based on (available on the compilation DVDBoys Briefs 3). Opposite the same actor as Troy (but a much less gorgeous actor as Raul, in an almost negligible role), he was sexy, and the attraction between him and Troy in Postmortem was palpable and totally believable; it's not in this movie (but Postmortem was set in sexy, dynamic NYC, not in sterile, boring LA, which may have a lot to do with it).Self-defeating compulsion is the only motivation either Jonathan or Troy shows in this movie, which may be intentional. August is a lot grittier and more complex (and therefore more interesting) than Postmortem was, which is why I'm giving it three stars despite the lackluster performance by Daniel Dugan in the key role as Jonathan. He was great playing the same character in Postmortem, but he'd lost the fire or something when August was made; since that character is central in the story, August suffers for it.",3,"Interesting expansion of a short film, weakened by a miscast key role",1349395200,"10 5, 2012",2012,2007,"['Jonathan', 'shortish', 'homely-ish', '29-year-old', 'minimally', 'employed', 'nebbish', 'LA', 'tall', 'gorgeous', 'shallow', 'manipulative', '40-ish', 'ex-boyfriend', 'Troy', 'who', 'dumped', 'five', 'years', 'earlier', 'reason', 'moved', 'back', 'Barcelona', 'just', 'get', 'back', 'BUT', 'Jonathan', 'even', 'MORE', 'gorgeous', 'breathtakingly', 'gorgeous', 'twentysomething', 'current', 'boyfriend', 'Raul', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'gorgeous', 'sweet', 'strong', 'sincere', 'totally', 'devoted', 'Right', 'away', 'say', 'just', 'like', 'real', 'life', 'just', 'two', 'incredible', 'hunks', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'What', 'homely', 'nebbish', 'girl', 'do', 'dilemma', 'movie', 'really', 'wanted', 'hate', ""can't.It"", 'actors', 'fault', ""'re"", 'very', 'very', 'good', 'TOO', 'good', 'unbelievable', 'story', 'Unfortunately', 'weakest', 'actor', 'one', 'playing', 'Jonathan', 'who', 'sensuality', 'charisma', 'other', 'hot', 'quality', 'role', 'compensate', 'nebbishy', 'homeliness', 'explain', 'WHY', 'two', 'hunks', 'are', 'so', 'irresistibly', 'attracted', 'him.He', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'believable', 'Postmortem', 'short', 'movie', 'based', 'available', 'compilation', 'DVDBoys', 'Briefs', '3', 'same', 'actor', 'Troy', 'much', 'less', 'gorgeous', 'actor', 'Raul', 'almost', 'negligible', 'role', 'was', 'sexy', 'attraction', 'Troy', 'Postmortem', 'was', 'palpable', 'totally', 'believable', 'not', 'movie', 'Postmortem', 'was', 'set', 'sexy', 'dynamic', 'NYC', 'not', 'sterile', 'boring', 'LA', 'may', 'have', 'lot', 'do', '.Self-defeating', 'compulsion', 'only', 'motivation', 'Jonathan', 'Troy', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'intentional', 'August', 'lot', 'grittier', 'more', 'complex', 'therefore', 'more', 'interesting', 'Postmortem', 'was', 'why', ""'m"", 'giving', 'three', 'stars', 'lackluster', 'performance', 'Daniel', 'Dugan', 'key', 'role', 'Jonathan', 'was', 'great', 'playing', 'same', 'character', 'Postmortem', ""'d"", 'lost', 'fire', 'something', 'when', 'August', 'was', 'made', 'character', 'central', 'story', 'August', 'suffers']",August

First you hated one in the triangle and next time you disliked or loved another. Each one made a point to do something that was really endearing or disliked and next it was another. Perplexing to put it mildly. I guess I am still confused. However, when a movie leaves me room for thought and a desire to see it again when in the mood, I would recommend it.

1545933,A8QG61LYK0XO1,B0084BM7NK,JUST A REVIEWER2,"[9, 12]","(( BACKGROUND FOR VIEWERS: This Feature Length film is a reworking of Director Eldar Rapaport's 2005, well received Short, ""Postmortem"" ))""August""....whatever is meant by that, you might ask? Well, rather than looking at the title as being merely a play on words, let's just assume what's meant is the ""simmering""...""sweat-drenched""...""torridness""...of that particular time in the yearly weather cycle. In fact, this is what becomes visually and audibly obvious to us, as our actors/characters experience sometimes uncomfortably high temperatures---a condition reinforced by repeated soundtrack use of Los Angeles area weathercasts. So, indeed, this film does have ""Heat""! ....But, it's not just that sort of ""Hotness"" which involves us...because ""Lovemaking Action"" makes up a significant part of what's being shown in this film.Still and all, IF a film director is going to expand an earlier released 16 minute Short into a 100 minute, Feature Length work....and essentially retain the same storyline and same 2 lead characters (tho now 6 years older)....there has GOT to be more provided than ""Heat""....more than ""Hotness"". Admittedly, a much lessor role in the short film's ""triangle of 3 guys"" has notably (and most SIZZLINGLY) been expanded in this 2011 production. For now we see the character of ""Raul"" being torridly played by relative newcomer, Adrian Gonzalez (giving us something not weather-related which definitely IS HOT). Oh, and we also have added a female role in the form of B(Girl)FF (and Green Card facilitator) ""Nina"", played by Hillary Banks.Now, allow this Reviewer to give just a few closing thoughts involving the ""old and new"" productions, as coming from someone who's lived with the former for years...and with the latter for a couple of viewings:- In the Short's early scene...involving former lovers meeting once again at an outdoor coffee house...there was an intimacy, a ""Heat"" between the 2, which burned off the screen and into the viewer. That is pretty much missing in today's re-tread scene and, for me, is due to one actor in particular.- Adding several extraneous scenery and street-related shots may add minutes to a feature's length....but it does not necessarily add interest.- I was sometimes left wondering which way writing and direction were heading with the sex shots. There is an anal sex scene, with virtually a full length, nude shot of the 2 going at it. Yet, at another point we're given an after-sex scene---our leads still together in bed---BUT wearing underwear (even tho the camera is, obviously, avoiding any ""crotch shots""). Are we advertising boxer briefs? Is this American network TV filming? Does our director expect this is ever to be shown as a K-Thru-12 (grade school thru high school) afternoon school special?- What I would consider a production glitch involves occasional sound problems, with music and background conversations drowning out conversation between lead characters (this is even with earphone listening). There is no captioning provided...at least in my Region 2 DVD.FINALLY -- Perhaps the best thing I can draw from this comparison of Short vs. Feature Length film, is that the feature definitely gives us a FINAL Ending...one which cannot be misconstrued or that is left up in the air. And even better than that....everyone gets what they deserve.PS -- Writer/Director Rapaport strikes me as being particularly capable of developing intense and interesting storylines; he should stick to doing that...in all-new works. (I do acknowledge it is not easy for anyone to expand a short story into an acclaimed full-length novel...let alone achieve fully successful refilming.)PPS -- If you would like to join in the fun of 2 guys who scorchingly C-O-N-N-E-C-T....grab a look at ""3"" (I've done a review)",3,Sometimes a Re-Tread just doesn't take......,1346198400,"08 29, 2012",2012,3779,"['BACKGROUND', 'FOR', 'VIEWERS', 'Feature', 'Length', 'film', 'reworking', 'Director', 'Eldar', 'Rapaport', '2005', 'well', 'received', 'Short', 'Postmortem', 'August', '.whatever', 'meant', 'might', 'ask', 'Well', 'rather', 'looking', 'title', 'being', 'merely', 'play', 'words', 'let', 'just', 'assume', 'what', 'meant', 'simmering', 'sweat-drenched', 'torridness', 'particular', 'time', 'yearly', 'weather', 'cycle', 'fact', 'what', 'visually', 'audibly', 'obvious', 'actors/characters', 'experience', 'sometimes', 'uncomfortably', 'high', 'temperatures', '-a', 'condition', 'reinforced', 'repeated', 'soundtrack', 'use', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'area', 'weathercasts', 'So', 'indeed', 'film', 'have', 'Heat', '.But', 'not', 'just', 'sort', 'Hotness', 'Lovemaking', 'Action', 'up', 'significant', 'part', 'what', 'being', 'shown', 'film.Still', 'IF', 'film', 'director', 'going', 'expand', 'earlier', 'released', '16', 'minute', 'Short', '100', 'minute', 'Feature', 'Length', 'work', '.and', 'essentially', 'retain', 'same', 'storyline', 'same', '2', 'lead', 'characters', 'tho', 'now', '6', 'years', 'older', '.there', 'GOT', 'be', 'more', 'provided', 'Heat', '.more', 'Hotness', 'Admittedly', 'much', 'lessor', 'role', 'short', 'film', 'triangle', '3', 'guys', 'notably', 'most', 'SIZZLINGLY', 'been', 'expanded', '2011', 'production', 'now', 'see', 'character', 'Raul', 'being', 'torridly', 'played', 'relative', 'newcomer', 'Adrian', 'Gonzalez', 'giving', 'something', 'not', 'weather-related', 'definitely', 'IS', 'HOT', 'Oh', 'also', 'have', 'added', 'female', 'role', 'form', 'B', 'Girl', 'FF', 'Green', 'Card', 'facilitator', 'Nina', 'played', 'Hillary', 'Banks.Now', 'allow', 'Reviewer', 'give', 'just', 'few', 'closing', 'thoughts', 'involving', 'old', 'new', 'productions', 'coming', 'someone', 'who', 'lived', 'former', 'years', 'latter', 'couple', 'viewings', 'Short', 'early', 'scene', 'involving', 'former', 'lovers', 'meeting', 'once', 'again', 'outdoor', 'coffee', 'house', 'was', 'intimacy', 'Heat', '2', 'burned', 'off', 'screen', 'viewer', 'pretty', 'much', 'missing', 'today', 're-tread', 'scene', 'due', 'one', 'actor', 'particular.-', 'Adding', 'several', 'extraneous', 'scenery', 'street-related', 'shots', 'may', 'add', 'minutes', 'feature', 'length', 'not', 'necessarily', 'add', 'interest.-', 'was', 'sometimes', 'left', 'wondering', 'way', 'writing', 'direction', 'were', 'heading', 'sex', 'shots', 'anal', 'sex', 'scene', 'virtually', 'full', 'length', 'nude', 'shot', '2', 'going', 'point', ""'re"", 'given', 'after-sex', 'scene', '-our', 'leads', 'still', 'together', 'bed', '-BUT', 'wearing', 'underwear', 'even', 'camera', 'obviously', 'avoiding', 'crotch', 'shots', 'Are', 'advertising', 'boxer', 'briefs', 'American', 'network', 'TV', 'filming', 'director', 'expect', 'ever', 'be', 'shown', 'K-Thru-12', 'grade', 'school', 'thru', 'high', 'school', 'afternoon', 'school', 'special', 'What', 'would', 'consider', 'production', 'glitch', 'occasional', 'sound', 'problems', 'music', 'background', 'conversations', 'drowning', 'out', 'conversation', 'lead', 'characters', 'even', 'earphone', 'listening', 'captioning', 'provided', 'least', 'Region', '2', 'DVD.FINALLY', 'Perhaps', 'best', 'thing', 'can', 'draw', 'comparison', 'Short', 'vs', 'Feature', 'Length', 'film', 'feature', 'definitely', 'FINAL', 'Ending', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'misconstrued', 'left', 'up', 'air', 'even', 'better', '.everyone', 'what', 'deserve.PS', 'Writer/Director', 'Rapaport', 'being', 'particularly', 'capable', 'developing', 'intense', 'interesting', 'storylines', 'should', 'stick', 'doing', 'all-new', 'works', 'do', 'acknowledge', 'not', 'easy', 'anyone', 'expand', 'short', 'story', 'acclaimed', 'full-length', 'novel', 'let', 'alone', 'achieve', 'fully', 'successful', 'refilming', 'PPS', 'would', 'like', 'join', 'fun', '2', 'guys', 'who', 'scorchingly', 'C-O-N-N-E-C-T', 'look', '3', ""'ve"", 'done', 'review']",August

Wonderful Middle Eastern mood music and songs with great lyrics, great cast in the smaller roles, terrific lighting both on the inside and outside shots, and portrays LA pretty much as it is.The story moves slowly, which is a quality that I like about European movies. You get to savor the characters and mood of the film. The resolution of the film was a surprise, and I really liked how the character of Raul (Adrian Gonzalez)figured out how to deal with the problem created by the return of the ex lover Troy (Murray Bartlett), kind of a put up or shut up situation.There were a couple of technical problems with the film that could have been much better. First, its really difficult editing a film to move around in time from the past to the present, back to the past etc...to express and idea of how the past is very much in the present and affects the future. Some films do this quite nicely. The viewer can switch gears when the next shot is in the past rather than the present and connect the dots well, and have the narrative make sense. This film does not do this well. Its confusing at times as to why, suddenly its in the past and what the point was.Also, a technique that filmmakers use to express a mood, is having single shots of something that are put in the film as a way to express an emotion. There are way too many of these shots in the film and they don't really convey anything. Its as if somebody forgot to take the shot out. Reminds me of The Winchester House in San Jose where hallways and doors lead nowhere, or there's a wall on the other side of the door.Now, as to the content, I wonder what the writer of this film had in mind. One thing's for sure, the theme really makes clear that a lasting relationship can't be based on sexual desire alone, or it will eventually crumble. Both Troy (Murray) and Johnathan (Daniel Dugan) appear as really unsympathetic characters. Throughout the film, Johnathan appears as if he is going to blow up in a rage, or suffer endlessly for something that he will regret and never have. Troy (Murray), looks as if he is looking for something that he will never have because he doesn't really have much to give. The sympathetic character is Raul (Adiran), who has the most to lose by possible deportation. He wisely does not throw a fit when Troy returns to LA, but waits it out to see what happens and comes up with an interesting solution to see whether Johnathan will choose him or Troy.I can see, somewhere down the road ,where Raul will get his green card, realize that Johnathan does not have that much to offer and dump him for someone much better, or Johnathan will grow and develop with age and be someone that is worth Raul's affection. That would make an interesting movie in itself.The film is however worth a watch and might even grow on a person with a second or third viewing.",3,a good film with flaws,1346025600,"08 27, 2012",2012,2904,"['are', 'several', 'good', 'things', 'recommend', 'film', 'Wonderful', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'mood', 'music', 'songs', 'great', 'lyrics', 'great', 'cast', 'smaller', 'roles', 'terrific', 'lighting', 'inside', 'outside', 'shots', 'portrays', 'LA', 'pretty', 'much', 'story', 'moves', 'slowly', 'quality', 'like', 'European', 'movies', 'get', 'savor', 'characters', 'mood', 'film', 'resolution', 'film', 'was', 'surprise', 'really', 'liked', 'how', 'character', 'Raul', 'Adrian', 'Gonzalez', 'figured', 'out', 'how', 'deal', 'problem', 'created', 'return', 'ex', 'lover', 'Troy', 'Murray', 'Bartlett', 'kind', 'put', 'up', 'shut', 'up', 'situation.There', 'were', 'couple', 'technical', 'problems', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'First', 'really', 'difficult', 'editing', 'film', 'move', 'around', 'time', 'past', 'present', 'back', 'past', 'etc', 'express', 'idea', 'how', 'past', 'very', 'much', 'present', 'future', 'films', 'do', 'quite', 'nicely', 'viewer', 'can', 'switch', 'gears', 'when', 'next', 'shot', 'past', 'rather', 'present', 'connect', 'dots', 'well', 'have', 'narrative', 'make', 'sense', 'film', 'not', 'do', 'well', 'confusing', 'times', 'why', 'suddenly', 'past', 'what', 'point', 'was.Also', 'technique', 'use', 'express', 'mood', 'having', 'single', 'shots', 'something', 'are', 'put', 'film', 'way', 'express', 'emotion', 'are', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'shots', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'convey', 'anything', 'somebody', 'forgot', 'take', 'shot', 'out', 'Reminds', 'Winchester', 'House', 'San', 'Jose', 'where', 'hallways', 'doors', 'lead', 'nowhere', 'wall', 'other', 'side', 'door.Now', 'content', 'wonder', 'what', 'writer', 'film', 'had', 'mind', 'One', 'thing', 'sure', 'theme', 'really', 'clear', 'lasting', 'relationship', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'based', 'sexual', 'desire', 'alone', 'will', 'eventually', 'crumble', 'Troy', 'Murray', 'Johnathan', 'Daniel', 'Dugan', 'appear', 'really', 'unsympathetic', 'characters', 'film', 'Johnathan', 'going', 'blow', 'up', 'rage', 'suffer', 'endlessly', 'something', 'will', 'regret', 'never', 'have', 'Troy', 'Murray', 'looking', 'something', 'will', 'never', 'have', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'much', 'give', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'Raul', 'Adiran', 'who', 'most', 'lose', 'possible', 'deportation', 'wisely', 'not', 'throw', 'fit', 'when', 'Troy', 'LA', 'out', 'see', 'what', 'up', 'interesting', 'solution', 'see', 'Johnathan', 'will', 'choose', 'Troy.I', 'can', 'see', 'somewhere', 'road', 'where', 'Raul', 'will', 'get', 'green', 'card', 'realize', 'Johnathan', 'not', 'have', 'that', 'much', 'offer', 'dump', 'someone', 'much', 'better', 'Johnathan', 'will', 'grow', 'develop', 'age', 'be', 'someone', 'worth', 'Raul', 'affection', 'would', 'make', 'interesting', 'movie', 'itself.The', 'film', 'however', 'worth', 'watch', 'might', 'even', 'grow', 'person', 'second', 'third', 'viewing']",August

1545953,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B0084BM7NK,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[0, 0]","That is the films strapline and is quite a good synopsis of where this film is coming from. It stars Murray Bartlett (Farscape) as Troy. He has been off for a number of years working in Barcelona, but now he has returned to Los Angeles and discovers to his consternation that his ex boyfriend is seeing someone else. This is Jonathan (Daniel Dugan) and he is going out with a hunky Latino Raul (Adrian Gonzales).Troy arranges to meet Jonathan for `a coffee' (that old chestnut) and it is clear from the get go that there are still strong feelings between them. Raul arrives and immediately puts his helmet on the table (he has come by scooter in case you thought it was getting smutty) and breaks up the coffee date before anything develops. Jon has helped Raul stay in the country by arranging a marriage of convenience and they clearly have affection for one another but have yet to commit to living together. As the summer temperatures rise, so does the obvious sexual tension and Raul decides to push things to an ultimate conclusion.This is described as `a languorous, lyrical exploration of love split three ways'. Whilst I tend to agree it also hints at what some may find problematic and that is that `lyrical' often translates as slow, this film does take its time, but I didn't really think that was an issue. Much of the plot development is subtle in that we have meaningful looks and words left unspoken or hanging in the air. When `action' does come it acts to break the spell like a kind of release valve of emotions.What this is also is a tale of missed opportunities and of taking loved ones for granted. Troy comes across as more than a little self centred and yet is at the same time vulnerable and likeable. There are some bedroom scenes but it is all pretty tame and works with the narrative rather than being put in for petty gratification. It is filmed using a number of techniques including the shaky hand cam that is starting to lose any novelty it once possessed, but the film does not suffer for it - it most certainly does not gain either.This 100 minute film is from director Eldar Rapaport who has made two award winning shorts `Post Mortem' and `Steam' -both included as extras. They have been available before and are featured on `Boys on Film 4', and there is a `behind the scenes' too. One of the more thoughtful gay films to come out recently so if you like the raunchier end of the spectrum this may not be for you, I thought it was a well acted, directed and confident film and as such enjoyed the journey.",4,"""Would you share your boyfriend?""",1348272000,"09 22, 2012",2012,2542,"['films', 'strapline', 'quite', 'good', 'synopsis', 'where', 'film', 'coming', 'Murray', 'Bartlett', 'Farscape', 'Troy', 'been', 'off', 'number', 'years', 'working', 'Barcelona', 'now', 'returned', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'discovers', 'consternation', 'ex', 'boyfriend', 'seeing', 'someone', 'else', 'Jonathan', 'Daniel', 'Dugan', 'going', 'out', 'hunky', 'Latino', 'Raul', 'Adrian', 'Gonzales', '.Troy', 'arranges', 'meet', 'Jonathan', 'coffee', 'old', 'chestnut', 'clear', 'get', 'go', 'are', 'still', 'strong', 'feelings', 'Raul', 'immediately', 'helmet', 'table', 'come', 'scooter', 'case', 'thought', 'was', 'getting', 'smutty', 'up', 'coffee', 'date', 'anything', 'Jon', 'helped', 'Raul', 'stay', 'country', 'arranging', 'marriage', 'convenience', 'clearly', 'have', 'affection', 'one', 'have', 'yet', 'commit', 'living', 'together', 'summer', 'temperatures', 'rise', 'so', 'obvious', 'sexual', 'tension', 'Raul', 'push', 'things', 'ultimate', 'conclusion.This', 'described', 'languorous', 'lyrical', 'exploration', 'love', 'split', 'three', 'ways', 'Whilst', 'tend', 'agree', 'also', 'what', 'may', 'find', 'problematic', 'lyrical', 'often', 'slow', 'film', 'take', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', 'was', 'issue', 'Much', 'plot', 'development', 'subtle', 'have', 'meaningful', 'looks', 'words', 'left', 'unspoken', 'hanging', 'air', 'When', 'action', 'come', 'break', 'spell', 'kind', 'release', 'valve', 'emotions.What', 'also', 'tale', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'taking', 'loved', 'ones', 'granted', 'Troy', 'more', 'little', 'self', 'centred', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'vulnerable', 'likeable', 'are', 'bedroom', 'scenes', 'pretty', 'tame', 'narrative', 'rather', 'being', 'put', 'petty', 'gratification', 'filmed', 'using', 'number', 'techniques', 'including', 'shaky', 'hand', 'cam', 'starting', 'lose', 'novelty', 'once', 'possessed', 'film', 'not', 'suffer', 'most', 'certainly', 'not', 'gain', 'either.This', '100', 'minute', 'film', 'director', 'Eldar', 'Rapaport', 'who', 'made', 'two', 'award', 'winning', 'shorts', 'Post', 'Mortem', 'Steam', '-both', 'included', 'extras', 'have', 'been', 'available', 'before', 'are', 'featured', 'Boys', 'Film', '4', 'scenes', 'too', 'One', 'more', 'thoughtful', 'gay', 'films', 'come', 'out', 'recently', 'so', 'like', 'raunchier', 'end', 'spectrum', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'thought', 'was', 'well', 'acted', 'directed', 'confident', 'film', 'such', 'journey']",August
