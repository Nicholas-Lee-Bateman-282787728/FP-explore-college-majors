1081808,APLIP1V0ARWO0,B000RIY5Z6,Brandon,"[1, 1]","This show is pretty good, it has some good fights (mainly dudeman getting the snot beat out of him and a bunch of fanservice) and a decent story with some well developed characters.  The issue is that the show never finished, it just ended right when things would have gotten good.  Basically the whole series sets itself up for nothing, read the manga its much better.ALSO, i purchased this item from a Millionare_2013 thinking that it was a legit copy but alas it was a bootleg (a decent one at that).  Since then that seller has stopped using Millionare as his/her main account (due to bad ratings) and is instead using SMOKE-MART, so if you feel like buying illigel stuff then go right ahead, but i personally wouldnt support that BS.  The real version is here on this same page but is very unreasonably priced so im sure that some of you will go for this.If you like stuff like this then check out Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple.  Also an unfinished anime adaption of a great manga but very very good nonetheless!",1,Bootleg of a decent yet unfufilled series.

The characters were interesting and unique and the scenarios were unlikely/fantastical but that's why we watch these kind of shows, not for reality. The on-going story was fun and moved well, the flashbacks were intriguing and definately fueled the on-going end. Everything was really picking up with character developments, motivations and even extended family interactions then around 22 eps in, alla the sudden that's it. It ended The OVAs that followed kind of give you a hint as to where they're going with it but even THOSE don't actually close the story off....everything was going well until the 3rd Act, then it fell on its face, thus the weak 3star vote.

Don't get me wrong its actually a good series but the backstory that explains all the beef between everyone up until the current time is waaay better than the actual real series itself.

They encounter the Jyuukenbu martial arts club. Souchirou and Bob are quickly stomped by the 3 members of the club. Impressed by their power the 2 friends join the club hoping to gain strength and learn the clubs secrets. Soon after that the Executive Enforcement Group starts a battle with the 5 club members. Will they be strong enough to fight them off?This anime is pretty good. The first thing I noticed was that the voice actors were also major characters in Bleach. The second thing I noticed was that the series reminded me of Ikki Tousen and Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple. It's like a cross between the two. There aren't naked chicks getting it on like in Ikki Tousen, and there is more juicy cleavage than in Kenichi. As far as fan service goes it is kind of in-between.  The character designs are cool, and the fight scenes are intense. This series also has a good soundtrack. It's a pretty well rounded anime. Hot chicks, bad dudes, and lots of butt kicking. It is 26 episodes long, is English dubbed, and has subtitles if you would rather listen to the original Japanese. I really enjoyed watching Tenjho Tenge.

1081815,A1SXC2Q4ECRPOA,B000RIY5Z6,Sekirei 1990,"[0, 0]",I bought this complete collection after watching the first two episodes on youtube. I was hooked on the series instantly. The animation is good and yet I haven't gotten a chance to watch this series I'm sure I'll love it in the end and it'll be a nice part of my collection.Also just so you know. This complete collection has three dvd's which come on a single spindle which I hate. So I simply found a clear three disc case with a flap to it so the discs wouldn't be moving around and would remain intact. There's an english dub with english subtitle you can watch or a japanese with english subtitle or my personal favorite which is english dub with no subtitles. Kinda funny actually though. I've never read the manga and probably won't because I'm not really into manga that much. But besides that there are all 26 episodes on these disc. Episode 1-9 on disc one and episode 10-17 on disc two and finally episode 18- 26 on disc three. I believe it's something like that. LOL.
