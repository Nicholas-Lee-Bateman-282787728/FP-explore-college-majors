989734,A2ZYFPHEDPBYDW,B000FGFUJK,Jobla,"[2, 2]","I love low-budget thrillers from the 1960's, and THE HOSTAGE is quite good.  It was theatrically released by Crown International Pictures, but I don't believe that it was a studio film.  I think it was an independent production that was filmed almost entirely in Des Moines, Iowa.  The color values probably weren't great even when the film was new.  However, the acting and script are always credible, and the villain is believably scary.  John Carradine and Harry Dean Stanton also appear in small roles.  If you like forgotten low-budget suspense pictures, this one really fills the bill.  The image is letterboxed.",4,THE HOSTAGE is a very good low-budget thriller,1264636800,"01 28, 2010",2010,618,"['love', 'low-budget', 'thrillers', '1960', 'THE', 'HOSTAGE', 'quite', 'good', 'was', 'theatrically', 'released', 'Crown', 'International', 'Pictures', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'was', 'studio', 'film', 'think', 'was', 'independent', 'production', 'was', 'filmed', 'almost', 'entirely', 'Des', 'Moines', 'Iowa', 'color', 'probably', 'were', ""n't"", 'great', 'even', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'new', 'However', 'acting', 'script', 'are', 'always', 'credible', 'villain', 'believably', 'scary', 'John', 'Carradine', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'also', 'appear', 'small', 'roles', 'like', 'forgotten', 'low-budget', 'suspense', 'pictures', 'one', 'really', 'bill', 'image', 'letterboxed']",Carnival of Crime/The Hostage
989735,A5UGX57EV695M,B000FGFUJK,Kenneth M. Pizzi,"[0, 3]","Hmmmm...it's hard to say something really positive about this DVD. Despite some interesting Brazilian locales in ""Carnival of Crime"" (surprisingly, the trailer is a better transfer than the movie!) the film lacks a real sense of continuity--it really seems like two different films in one about a wealthy Brazilian building developer accused of killing his wife only to find out about her numerous affairs with his associates and business partners.  The print is so bad, replete with pops, surface dirt and jumps, it makes the movie painful to watch. A pity since it looks rather interesting.As to 'The Hostage"" the only remarkable thing about it is the early appearance of Harry Dean Stanton as the meek half of a moving van crew who is an accomplice to a murder his partner has committed.  (They store the body in a chest of drawers inside the van until they can dispose of it.) Horror veteran John Carradine makes a cameo appearance as a vagrant and a link to the missing boy--hence the title of the movie.  While it can be argued that the film has some noir elements to it, it is lightyears away in quality or suspense from any traditional noir thrillers I have seen.Despite the annoying title theme song whose refain is replayed ad nauseum throughout the movie, this film is poorly acted with very cheap production values that makes it look like an amateur production; nonetheless, the film is hardly suspenseful or interesting for that matter. This is surprising as Crown International Pictures who produced the film and, although responsible for many low-budget but interesting movies made in the 50's and 60's, ""The Hostage"" must be seen as one of their lesser efforts using virtually unknown actors.The print of ""The Hostage"" is actually nicely restored, however.  Made in 1967, it must have been on the bottom half of a double-bill and deservedly so; thankfully, I purchased my DVD for only $3.99 at Rite-Aid!",2,There are better  films to waste 2 hours on...,1189641600,"09 13, 2007",2007,1919,"['Hmmmm', 'hard', 'say', 'something', 'really', 'positive', 'DVD', 'interesting', 'Brazilian', 'locales', 'Carnival', 'Crime', 'surprisingly', 'trailer', 'better', 'transfer', 'movie', 'film', 'real', 'sense', 'continuity', 'really', 'two', 'different', 'films', 'one', 'wealthy', 'Brazilian', 'building', 'developer', 'accused', 'killing', 'wife', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'numerous', 'affairs', 'associates', 'business', 'partners', 'print', 'so', 'bad', 'replete', 'pops', 'surface', 'dirt', 'jumps', 'movie', 'painful', 'watch', 'pity', 'rather', 'interesting.As', ""'The"", 'Hostage', 'only', 'remarkable', 'thing', 'early', 'appearance', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'meek', 'half', 'moving', 'van', 'crew', 'who', 'accomplice', 'murder', 'partner', 'committed', 'store', 'body', 'chest', 'drawers', 'van', 'can', 'dispose', 'Horror', 'veteran', 'John', 'Carradine', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'vagrant', 'link', 'missing', 'boy', 'hence', 'title', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'argued', 'film', 'noir', 'elements', 'lightyears', 'away', 'quality', 'suspense', 'traditional', 'noir', 'thrillers', 'have', 'seen.Despite', 'annoying', 'title', 'theme', 'song', 'refain', 'replayed', 'ad', 'nauseum', 'movie', 'film', 'poorly', 'acted', 'very', 'cheap', 'production', 'values', 'look', 'amateur', 'production', 'nonetheless', 'film', 'hardly', 'suspenseful', 'interesting', 'matter', 'surprising', 'Crown', 'International', 'Pictures', 'who', 'produced', 'film', 'responsible', 'many', 'low-budget', 'interesting', 'movies', 'made', '50', '60', 'Hostage', 'must', 'be', 'seen', 'one', 'lesser', 'efforts', 'using', 'virtually', 'unknown', 'actors.The', 'print', 'Hostage', 'actually', 'nicely', 'restored', 'however', 'Made', '1967', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'bottom', 'half', 'double-bill', 'deservedly', 'so', 'thankfully', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'only', '3.99', 'Rite-Aid']",Carnival of Crime/The Hostage

The first film, CARNIVAL OF CRIME, is a perfect match. By that I mean it's an awful movie with an equally awful transfer. The movie is supposed to be about an architect searching for his missing wife, only he ends up finding out about her many infidelities. The story was really dull and the audio and video was extremely low grade. In fact about 10 minutes into the film, it seems to switch to a completely different film (soundtrack and all) and then switches back again. The second movie, THE HOSTAGE, was not too bad. The audio and video was excellent and it's in widescreen. The story about a boy getting trapped inside a moving van driven by a psycho-killer moving man was OK. The little boy actually does a good acting job. It wouldn't be a big loss if you missed seeing either one of these films.

A boy is accidentally locked in the back of a moving van driven by two killers.  A nosy neighbor saw him with a derelict in the park (John Carradine), leading everyone in the wrong direction while the boy witnesses the drivers burying their victim.  The situation, similar to The Window (1949), or Home Alone without the comedy, is very suspenseful due to good acting (especially by Harry Dean Stanton & the boy, played by Danny Martins), noir -ish cinematography, and effective direction, and despite a low production cost, the only effect of which is slightly faded color.",4,The Hostage,1171065600,"02 10, 2007",2007,640,"['Hostage', 'was', 'designed', 'suspense', 'executed', 'effectively', 'boy', 'accidentally', 'locked', 'back', 'moving', 'van', 'driven', 'two', 'killers', 'nosy', 'neighbor', 'saw', 'derelict', 'park', 'John', 'Carradine', 'leading', 'everyone', 'wrong', 'direction', 'boy', 'drivers', 'burying', 'victim', 'situation', 'similar', 'Window', '1949', 'Home', 'Alone', 'comedy', 'very', 'suspenseful', 'due', 'good', 'acting', 'especially', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'boy', 'played', 'Danny', 'Martins', 'noir', '-ish', 'cinematography', 'effective', 'direction', 'low', 'production', 'cost', 'only', 'effect', 'slightly', 'faded', 'color']",Carnival of Crime/The Hostage
