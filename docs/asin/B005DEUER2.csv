There were no DVDS, VHS tape were expensive. People would enjoyed and were rivited in pot-boilers like Aspen.As a film, Aspen was a three night fest of murder and mayhem,  Tom Keating (Sam Elliot), an attorney who defense Lee Bishop (Perry King) for killing a 15 year old.The pilot of this tele-film seems like well worn Perry Mason episides. Sorry Sam, You are NO Raymond Burr. Perry King seems to over play his role as Bishop.AS a film is does seem over-long. However in the late 1970's, this is standard three night gig for a mini series. So  understand it was drawn out due to its format of what it was used for.The trick about the mini-series of the 1970 and 1980s is the film is fill the show  with many guest appeances of familar stars in smaller roles. Aspen's guest cast includes such actors John (The Paper Chase: Season One) Houseman, Gene (Burke's Law: Season 1 - Volume 1 (First 16 Episodes))Barry, Anothony Franciosa, Roger (Dark Shadows) Davis, Joseph Cotton, and  Bo (Dynasty) Hopkins,This tele-film tranfer to DVD is not the cleanest master recording I have seen. So the TV film seem muddled and washed out in its trasmission onto DVD.It is worth watching if you are a fan of legal thrillers or Sam Ellott.

This first aired in 1977 and was one of my favorite miniseries.  I've been waiting for this to come out on DVD for a long time.  The acting and plot are stellar and the scenery is beautiful.This story takes place in a plush Colorado ski resort in the 1960s.  It involves illicit sex, corruption, desire, and murder -- things that make up any good miniseries.It revolves around the sensational trial of accused rapist-killer Lee Bishop, played by the wonderful Perry King (Rip Tide, Melrose Place, Mandingo).  Bishop is a handsome young drifter who is arrested, tried and sentenced to die for the rape/murder of a 15-year-old girl -- a crime for which he is innocent.Tom Keating, played by the great Sam Elliott (Roadhouse, The Sacketts, Legacy, Lifeguard, Once an Eagle) is his friend and straight-arrow attorney trying desperately to prove his innocence and find the true killer.Elliott and King are joined by a truly amazing cast, including the beautiful Michelle Phillips, Gene Barry, Bo Hopkins, Anthony Franciosa, Roger Davis, Joseph Cotten, Jessica Harper, John Houseman and many others.The series was beautifully filmed on location in the winter playground of the rich and famous -- Aspen, Colorado.  The picturesque scenery and wonderful cast add up to a very beautiful, suspenseful and well-acted mini-series.Executive producer Roy Huggins, (The Virginian, Maverick, The Fugitive, The Rockford Files, 77 Sunset Strip) was known for his outstanding work, and Aspen is no exception.This sprawling 3-part miniseries covers the years as Bishop sits on death row, while his attorney and friend, Tom, tries to prove his innocence.DVD FEATURES * Full Screen Presentation * Interactive Menus * Chapter Selection",5,One of my favorite miniseries of all time!,1316476800,"09 20, 2011",2011,1788,"['70s', 'lot', 'bestselling', 'books', 'were', 'made', 'excellent', 'miniseries', 'first', 'aired', '1977', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'miniseries', ""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'long', 'time', 'acting', 'plot', 'are', 'stellar', 'scenery', 'beautiful.This', 'story', 'place', 'plush', 'Colorado', 'ski', 'resort', '1960s', 'illicit', 'sex', 'corruption', 'desire', 'murder', 'things', 'make', 'up', 'good', 'miniseries.It', 'revolves', 'sensational', 'trial', 'accused', 'rapist-killer', 'Lee', 'Bishop', 'played', 'wonderful', 'Perry', 'King', 'Rip', 'Tide', 'Melrose', 'Place', 'Mandingo', 'Bishop', 'handsome', 'young', 'drifter', 'who', 'arrested', 'tried', 'sentenced', 'die', 'rape/murder', '15-year-old', 'girl', 'crime', 'innocent.Tom', 'Keating', 'played', 'great', 'Sam', 'Elliott', 'Roadhouse', 'Sacketts', 'Legacy', 'Lifeguard', 'Once', 'Eagle', 'friend', 'straight-arrow', 'attorney', 'trying', 'desperately', 'prove', 'innocence', 'find', 'true', 'killer.Elliott', 'King', 'are', 'joined', 'truly', 'amazing', 'cast', 'including', 'beautiful', 'Michelle', 'Phillips', 'Gene', 'Barry', 'Bo', 'Hopkins', 'Anthony', 'Franciosa', 'Roger', 'Davis', 'Joseph', 'Cotten', 'Jessica', 'Harper', 'John', 'Houseman', 'many', 'others.The', 'series', 'was', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'location', 'winter', 'playground', 'rich', 'famous', 'Aspen', 'Colorado', 'picturesque', 'scenery', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'add', 'up', 'very', 'beautiful', 'suspenseful', 'well-acted', 'mini-series.Executive', 'producer', 'Roy', 'Huggins', 'Virginian', 'Maverick', 'Fugitive', 'Rockford', 'Files', '77', 'Sunset', 'Strip', 'was', 'known', 'outstanding', 'work', 'Aspen', 'exception.This', 'sprawling', '3-part', 'miniseries', 'years', 'Bishop', 'death', 'row', 'attorney', 'friend', 'Tom', 'prove', 'innocence.DVD', 'FEATURES', '*', 'Full', 'Screen', 'Presentation', '*', 'Interactive', 'Menus', '*', 'Chapter', 'Selection']",N/A
1455406,A35UZ0I53VKXH8,B005DEUER2,M. P. Sebar,"[5, 7]","One of the most inspirational actors of the time Sam Elliot originally inspired my writing career, particularly the ""Sheriff Wyler Scott EBook Series"" with his movie series Aspen from 1977. I related to this, because at that time I was also getting into Alpine Snow Skiing which is the main industry that Aspen was and remains about to this very day. I felt that Sam Elliott would also make a great no nonsense sheriff too, but that's another story.This story centers around a tough and eager attorney in town who saves a friend's life. Tom Keating is a very human and powerful character and one that Mr. Elliott easily fit into. I don't think they could have cast a more talented, nor perfect acting talent for this role. Of all the Sam Elliott movies I have watched, this was it. The story centers around a young man pursuing a wealthy woman whose father plans to develop Aspen into a resort in the year 1964. But not all goes well as the man soon is framed for a murder he didn't commit. Worse, Tom Keating's boss played by another great actor (John Houseman - Paper Chase) flubs up in court, do to his aging old arrogance, asks the wrong questions, ignores warning signs an astute attorney would have seen, resulting in a murder conviction for this innocent client, because of bad representation. The story really moves from here as Attorney Tom Keating (Elliott) continues for almost a decade gaining a stay of execution for his client. Eventually Tom's friend whose life he saved back-stabs him, but there is a poetic justice at the end.The settings and atmosphere of this period of time that I grew up in the 60's shows a lot of a previous culture long gone, and also a part of the United States that at that time is rare in media formats too. It also touches on how western and remote cowboys changed with the time in Keating's daddy who owns a key piece of property that Franciosa wants as well as the mob from Chicago. So there is definitely a bit of the wild west or modern wild west tossed in. I found the story to be great back in 1977 when ABC TV aired it as their mini series. I have to admit I was glued back then and was this time as well. One disappointment I did experience with the DVD though was that in the lodge scene with the late great Tony Franciosa as a gangster and Elliott. They played the 1964 Motown hit Four Tops song ""Baby I Need Your Loving"" and in the DVD this was cut out for hippy folk music. There weren't many other issues but I did feel a bit shortchanged that this scene was different than what I remembered as that Four Tops tune was also a part of that era with the late Levi Stubbs and the gang. Other than that, it played as a great movie and it is something you will watch, long as it is, more than once for many, but not all folks. I hope this was informative, and thanks for reading. Now break out the pop corn, kick back for a nice mini series, a few logs in the fireplace and Sam Elliott as a tough mountain outdoorsy type.
