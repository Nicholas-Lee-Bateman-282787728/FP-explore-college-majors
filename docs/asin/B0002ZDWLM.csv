Lash La Rue ""King of the Bullwhip"" is about 63 years old and still commands the bullwhip. Some beautiful collegiate women rent a house in southern USA  which belonged to an old Indian Shaman who had aquired the land of his people form the government prior to his passing. The land is haunted by spiriits of  Toltec warriors who surface to taunt and torture the present occupants of this house. Lash La Rue comes to their rescue in classic Lash fashion. It is filled with unknown actors and relatively poor dialogue, but I enjoyed it and recommend it to any Lash La Rue fans.

853364,A3500UVGFOC9PA,B0002ZDWLM,Paulmeister,"[16, 23]","Greetings. This is the official review for The Dark Power, which may just  as well have been titled The Dark Flower, seeing as how ridiculous it is, it should warrant a more ridiculous title.I should warn you, reader, that this is not exactly a B movie. Rather, more like C, or D, if those classifications exist.The movie has to do with a hill somewhere in the southeastern US, near a college, apparently, that was once a ritual site for ancient Toltec Native American priests. An old Indian acquires the property for the purpose of guarding the local residents in sealing off the dark power that lurks beneath the ground. However, his death leads to the breaking of the protective seals placed around the hill. A group of college girls decide to turn the late Native's residence into a sorority house, but some guys decide it should be a fraternity as well. The ancient priests rise and set out to create havoc.And it would have been pretty good, too, if the inane Director had been more consistent in his approach as to how the undead Priests should behave and look.The bottom line is, whoever made this movie sucks!I can picture their film/video instructor seeing this and shaking his head going, ""I have failed!"" and probably shooting himself in the head. The word 'campy' is too generous here. You will never, ever, be scared of these zombies, or believe for one second that they are Toltec Priests. They look nothing like the part, and what's worse, they never for one second act the part. The entire movie, up to the point of the undead rising, was actually not too bad, but once the mayhem starts, you might as well consider the movie finished, because there's really no reward in watching the last half hour, and the wrap-up is extremely brief before the credits roll.Is it fun? Kinda. Is it worth 5 dollars? No. Is it worth 3 dollars? Maybe. Is it worth watching? Not really... There are just much better movies out there for this kind of thing. The most I can say is that it was an experience. I'll give it that.",2,The Dark Flower,1205798400,"03 18, 2008",2008,2023,"['Greetings', 'official', 'review', 'Dark', 'Power', 'may', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'titled', 'Dark', 'Flower', 'seeing', 'how', 'ridiculous', 'should', 'warrant', 'more', 'ridiculous', 'title.I', 'should', 'warn', 'reader', 'not', 'exactly', 'B', 'movie', 'more', 'C', 'D', 'classifications', 'exist.The', 'movie', 'do', 'hill', 'somewhere', 'southeastern', 'US', 'college', 'apparently', 'was', 'once', 'ritual', 'site', 'ancient', 'Toltec', 'Native', 'American', 'priests', 'old', 'Indian', 'property', 'purpose', 'guarding', 'local', 'residents', 'sealing', 'off', 'dark', 'power', 'ground', 'However', 'death', 'breaking', 'protective', 'seals', 'placed', 'hill', 'group', 'college', 'girls', 'decide', 'turn', 'late', 'Native', 'residence', 'sorority', 'house', 'guys', 'decide', 'should', 'be', 'fraternity', 'as', 'well', 'ancient', 'priests', 'rise', 'set', 'out', 'create', 'havoc.And', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'pretty', 'good', 'too', 'inane', 'Director', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'consistent', 'approach', 'how', 'undead', 'Priests', 'should', 'behave', 'look.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'whoever', 'made', 'movie', 'can', 'picture', 'film/video', 'instructor', 'seeing', 'shaking', 'head', 'going', 'have', 'failed', 'probably', 'shooting', 'head', 'word', 'too', 'generous', 'here', 'will', 'never', 'ever', 'be', 'scared', 'zombies', 'believe', 'one', 'second', 'are', 'Toltec', 'Priests', 'look', 'nothing', 'part', 'what', 'worse', 'never', 'one', 'second', 'act', 'part', 'entire', 'movie', 'up', 'point', 'undead', 'rising', 'was', 'actually', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'once', 'mayhem', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'consider', 'movie', 'finished', 'really', 'reward', 'watching', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'wrap-up', 'extremely', 'brief', 'credits', 'roll.Is', 'fun', 'Kinda', 'worth', '5', 'dollars', 'worth', '3', 'dollars', 'Maybe', 'watching', 'Not', 'really', 'are', 'just', 'much', 'better', 'movies', 'out', 'there', 'kind', 'thing', 'most', 'can', 'say', 'was', 'experience', ""'ll"", 'give']","Dark Power, the"
