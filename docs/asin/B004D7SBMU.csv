I once saw a documentary on the mind and like much in science, it asked, ""Well, what happens when things do wrong?""  So it first looked at Alzheimer's and brains ravaged by tina, etc.  I could predict the structure of the documentary there, but not for this one.  Think of this doc as a series of minisodes.  It covers magic tricks, machine that can inhibit actions, synethesia (sp?), computers that can beat humans in games, etc.  This is just tracking what researchers around the nation happen to be studying.There are many scenes here in which the narrator is shown interacting with another version of himself.  I have loved, loved, loved that in Eurythmics, Mariah Carey, or Madonna videos.  However, it felt silly here.  I think in music videos for women, they are studying contrasts and stock characters: good and evil, housewives and vamps, etc.  It wasn't done to express a deep concept, just to display a video trick.The narrator concludes by saying, ""As chemistry was born out of alchemy, perhaps neuroscience will replace psychology.""  Despite his smile, I think many on college campuses will find that scary.  Departments often receive funds based on their number of majoring students.  Psychology departments would be trembling if all the students abandoned them for neuroscience.This isn't something I would need to view again and again, or speak about for years to come.  However, it's a nice user-friendly watch.  It would be suitable for high school and junior high science class viewing.",3,viewer-friendly current research on the mind,1302566400,"04 12, 2011",2011,1599,"['title', 'question', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'receive', 'definitive', 'answer', 'here', 'once', 'saw', 'documentary', 'mind', 'like', 'much', 'science', 'asked', 'Well', 'what', 'when', 'things', 'do', 'wrong', 'first', 'looked', 'Alzheimer', 'brains', 'ravaged', 'tina', 'etc', 'could', 'predict', 'structure', 'documentary', 'there', 'not', 'one', 'Think', 'doc', 'series', 'minisodes', 'magic', 'tricks', 'machine', 'can', 'inhibit', 'actions', 'synethesia', 'sp', 'computers', 'can', 'beat', 'humans', 'games', 'etc', 'just', 'tracking', 'what', 'researchers', 'nation', 'happen', 'be', 'studying.There', 'are', 'many', 'scenes', 'here', 'narrator', 'shown', 'interacting', 'version', 'have', 'loved', 'loved', 'loved', 'Eurythmics', 'Mariah', 'Carey', 'Madonna', 'videos', 'However', 'felt', 'silly', 'here', 'think', 'music', 'videos', 'women', 'are', 'studying', 'contrasts', 'stock', 'characters', 'good', 'evil', 'housewives', 'vamps', 'etc', 'was', ""n't"", 'done', 'express', 'deep', 'concept', 'just', 'display', 'video', 'trick.The', 'narrator', 'concludes', 'saying', 'chemistry', 'was', 'born', 'alchemy', 'perhaps', 'neuroscience', 'will', 'replace', 'psychology', 'smile', 'think', 'many', 'college', 'campuses', 'will', 'find', 'scary', 'Departments', 'often', 'receive', 'funds', 'based', 'number', 'majoring', 'students', 'Psychology', 'departments', 'would', 'be', 'trembling', 'students', 'abandoned', 'neuroscience.This', ""n't"", 'something', 'would', 'need', 'view', 'again', 'again', 'speak', 'years', 'come', 'However', 'nice', 'user-friendly', 'watch', 'would', 'be', 'suitable', 'high', 'school', 'junior', 'high', 'science', 'class', 'viewing']",Nova Science Now: How Does the Brain Work

Brain Games does the same thing. Both use tricks to show how easy it is to fool someone. Neither DVD set gives the information I want to know about the human brain.Instead I recommend NOVA's Secrets of the Mind hosted by Dr. V.S. Ramachandran, which goes much deeper into subjects such as phantom limb syndrome,intense spiritual experiences and how the brain rewires itself.
