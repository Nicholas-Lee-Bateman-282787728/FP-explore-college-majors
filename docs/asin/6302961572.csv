347394,AAZRWLML88IZK,6302961572,A kids review,"[0, 0]","The Fox and the Hound is another one of those Disney movies that probably has to many cutsy scenes in but, to it's credit, it uses them to much more of an advantage. It's about a little fox who loses his mother and get taken up by an old lady who, unfortuantly, lives next door to a hunter who has a dog. Two dogs, actually. But one of them is a puppy trying to learn how to hunt. Obviously you think these two wouldn't be able to get along, but they hit it off, and over time their friendship grows stronger, despite everybody telling them they will be ememies.They keep playing, and having fun, and constantly getting into trouble. It's not until the dog is taken away for a long time and becomes a professional hunter dog, that he returns and finds that their friendship can not be the way they were. By accidnet to fox injures the dog's best friend and the dog vows vengance.And on top of that the old woman finds she can't take care of the fox anymore and sets him loose in the wild. This, accoding to every woman I've ever talked to, is a big tearjerker scene. So the two are now enemeies, out for blood, and tring to see who will come out on top.It's a good set up for a story and they do it pretty well, but, I have to admit, I felt it could be a little stronger. Like instead of the best friend getting injured, why didn't he die? I'm sorry. It's just, this movie would be alot more powerflu if that dog died. Well, how about when the woman is letting the fox go and having some instrumental music or ahving it silent, instead of playing whatever pop song was popular at the time? Little tidbits like that really keep me from loving this film, but, as a Disney film, it's pretty strong.The big scene after the climax has a really good payoff and you find yourself very invested in it. I like I said some of the cutsy scenes drag a bit, but I think it's allowed to drag, sort of the same way Bambi was allowed to drag. You know you're going to get to the harder stuff later. I just wish it was a little harder. I don't know, maybe it the sick person in me, but I think it could have been more adult. But as is it's a good movie.The songs aren't that memorable and I don't really remember any of the side characters either, but it's the friendship between the two of them that really holds up. I say it's definly worth your time taking a watch.",4,The Fox and the Hound,1324252800,"12 19, 2011",2011,2351,"['Fox', 'Hound', 'one', 'Disney', 'movies', 'probably', 'many', 'cutsy', 'scenes', 'credit', 'much', 'more', 'advantage', 'little', 'fox', 'who', 'mother', 'get', 'taken', 'up', 'old', 'lady', 'who', 'unfortuantly', 'next', 'door', 'hunter', 'who', 'dog', 'Two', 'dogs', 'actually', 'one', 'puppy', 'trying', 'learn', 'how', 'hunt', 'Obviously', 'think', 'two', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'get', 'along', 'hit', 'off', 'time', 'friendship', 'stronger', 'everybody', 'telling', 'will', 'be', 'ememies.They', 'keep', 'playing', 'having', 'fun', 'constantly', 'getting', 'trouble', 'not', 'dog', 'taken', 'away', 'long', 'time', 'professional', 'hunter', 'dog', 'friendship', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'way', 'were', 'accidnet', 'fox', 'injures', 'dog', 'best', 'friend', 'dog', 'vengance.And', 'top', 'old', 'woman', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'care', 'fox', 'anymore', 'loose', 'wild', 'accoding', 'woman', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'talked', 'big', 'tearjerker', 'scene', 'two', 'are', 'now', 'enemeies', 'blood', 'tring', 'see', 'who', 'will', 'come', 'out', 'top.It', 'good', 'set', 'up', 'story', 'do', 'pretty', 'well', 'have', 'admit', 'felt', 'could', 'be', 'little', 'stronger', 'instead', 'best', 'friend', 'getting', 'injured', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'die', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'just', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'alot', 'more', 'powerflu', 'dog', 'died', 'Well', 'how', 'about', 'when', 'woman', 'letting', 'fox', 'go', 'having', 'instrumental', 'music', 'ahving', 'silent', 'instead', 'playing', 'pop', 'song', 'was', 'popular', 'time', 'Little', 'tidbits', 'really', 'keep', 'loving', 'film', 'Disney', 'film', 'pretty', 'strong.The', 'big', 'scene', 'climax', 'really', 'good', 'payoff', 'find', 'very', 'invested', 'like', 'said', 'cutsy', 'scenes', 'drag', 'bit', 'think', 'allowed', 'drag', 'sort', 'same', 'way', 'Bambi', 'was', 'allowed', 'drag', 'know', ""'re"", 'going', 'get', 'harder', 'stuff', 'later', 'just', 'wish', 'was', 'little', 'harder', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'maybe', 'sick', 'person', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'adult', 'good', 'movie.The', 'songs', 'are', ""n't"", 'memorable', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'remember', 'side', 'characters', 'friendship', 'two', 'really', 'up', 'say', 'definly', 'worth', 'time', 'taking', 'watch']",N/A
347395,A3CSRP3P4U9HI,6302961572,Alan R. Holyoak,"[1, 3]","&quot;Fox and the Hound&quot; had relatively little box office success when it came out in 1981.  The story does have home-spun appeal, but doesn't really come together as a memorable experience.The story  centers on an orphaned fox, taken in by a kindly widow woman when he is  just a kit.  At the same time, across the creek at the next farm, a new  hunting dog pup is brought home by a gruff hunter.  The two, the fox and  the hound, soon run into each other and become fast friends.  Reality soon  intrudes on their friendship when the pup, Copper, heads off on his first  hunting trip and returns as a seasoned hunting dog.The voice of Mickey  Rooney as the mature Fox was somewhat miscast.  A more youthful actor would  have gone over better for me.  Sandy Duncan made a great lady fox's voice,  and Kurt Russell as the mature Copper was a good choice.It's clear  that Disney was pulling heavily on its stable of actors to provide the  voice work for this film.  Later Disney efforts haven't done that -- come  to think of it, does Disney even have a stable of actors anymore?The  strongest part of this movie has to be the scene of the bear attack --  total power, that!  And I liked the side characters, the woodpecker and the  sparrow who were in constant search of the caterpillar.  Big Momma was OK,  but not my favorite.  The music was appropriate, but in lower class than  the kind of music Disney now uses.All in all a good show, definitely  worth 4 stars, but not up to a 5 star rating.Enjoy!Alan Holyoak",4,"Good, but a step below more recent Disney efforts",962150400,"06 28, 2000",2000,1519,"['quot', 'Fox', 'Hound', 'quot', 'had', 'relatively', 'little', 'box', 'office', 'success', 'when', 'came', 'out', '1981', 'story', 'have', 'home-spun', 'appeal', ""n't"", 'really', 'come', 'together', 'memorable', 'experience.The', 'story', 'centers', 'orphaned', 'fox', 'taken', 'kindly', 'widow', 'woman', 'when', 'just', 'kit', 'same', 'time', 'creek', 'next', 'farm', 'new', 'hunting', 'dog', 'pup', 'brought', 'home', 'gruff', 'hunter', 'two', 'fox', 'hound', 'soon', 'run', 'other', 'become', 'fast', 'friends', 'Reality', 'soon', 'intrudes', 'friendship', 'when', 'pup', 'Copper', 'off', 'first', 'hunting', 'trip', 'returns', 'seasoned', 'hunting', 'dog.The', 'voice', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'mature', 'Fox', 'was', 'somewhat', 'miscast', 'more', 'youthful', 'actor', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'over', 'better', 'Sandy', 'Duncan', 'made', 'great', 'lady', 'fox', 'voice', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'mature', 'Copper', 'was', 'good', 'choice.It', 'clear', 'Disney', 'was', 'pulling', 'heavily', 'stable', 'actors', 'provide', 'voice', 'work', 'film', 'Later', 'Disney', 'efforts', 'have', ""n't"", 'done', 'come', 'think', 'Disney', 'even', 'have', 'stable', 'actors', 'anymore', 'strongest', 'part', 'movie', 'be', 'scene', 'bear', 'attack', 'total', 'power', 'liked', 'side', 'characters', 'woodpecker', 'sparrow', 'who', 'were', 'constant', 'search', 'caterpillar', 'Big', 'Momma', 'was', 'OK', 'not', 'favorite', 'music', 'was', 'appropriate', 'lower', 'class', 'kind', 'music', 'Disney', 'now', 'good', 'show', 'definitely', 'worth', '4', 'stars', 'not', 'up', '5', 'star', 'rating.Enjoy', 'Alan', 'Holyoak']",N/A

347401,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6302961572,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","Growing up, `The Fox and the Hound' was one of the few Disney films on constant rotation in my house.  It is my father's favorite Disney movie.  It reduces him to tears every time he watches it, and it is those emotions that forced him to force us kids to watch this film, a lot.  I can't complain.  I cry too, and watching this film in my adulthood I have to say that this is easily not only one of the most underrated Disney films, but one of the best.Disney had a great way of infusing such timeless tales with socially aware themes, and `The Fox and the Hound' is no exception, standing tall even today as a cautionary tale on prejudices of any kind and the folly of allowing ignorance to mold your own viewpoints.  With bullying and equality being the center of a lot of talk these days (isn't it always?), a film like `The Fox and the Hound' may not feel like the kind of film that could enlighten some, but in reality it is extremely insightful and poignant.The story revolves around a young fox and young bloodhound that become the best of friends.  All is find and innocent until they grow up and become enemies.  Forced to change due to their social surroundings (where foxes are bad and bloodhounds are supposed to protect against them) their relationship takes a serious shift and becomes something truly alarming and heartbreaking.  The film is not shy about shoveling through the consequences of this particular shift, and the finale is a bucket of tears for all ages.It's sad to me that this film is relegated to back of the Disney canon.

However, maybe the sentiment it brought was what impressed us most.Tod and Copper were natural enemies, but because of valuable innocence, they became good friends. It's so unbelievable, and we all wished that their friendship could last forever, but we cleared about that it couldn't, though they have played together, loved each other and promised each other. After they have been separated, then they met for the first time after they've grown up, their conversation felt like two strangers's, so carefully and strangely! I know that everything between them has changed - Copper knew what his responsibility was, and Tod knew that what he should do, especially after Chief was hurt badly. When Tod was sent away, I could feel the sorrow of the keeper and the loneliness of Tod, then my tears fell unconsciously. But when I saw hesitation on Copper's face when his keeper told him how he planned to frame Tod, I saw a little hope of their friendship. At last, Copper stood at front of Tod when his keeper was about to shot Tod. When I saw this, I didn't know my tears came from joy or sorrow. Maybe it was because that their friendship recovered, or their friendship hasn't changed essentially, they were only executing their own responsibilities. However, I knew that their initial innocent friendship wouldn't exist any more.After having watched this movie, my heart couldn't be calm for a long time.

Next door lives a crabby old hunter who has brought home a new hound dog pup named Copper. As pups, they play together, although they have to keep away from the old hound dog who is supposed to be teaching Copper how to be a hunting dog. They promise to be best friends forever.Of course, the hunter has other ideas. He takes Copper and the old hound to his winter cabin to learn how to hunt, where of course Copper does learn. He learns so well, and grow so fast, that by the time they return to the summer cabin next to the Widow's, Copper and Tod are both pretty full-grown. Copper understands that he's supposed to be tracking Tod and leading the hunter to him. There's enough trouble that the widow takes Tod out into the game preserve where she assumes he will be safe.Not quite. With the help of Big Mama acting as matchmaker, he meets and charms Vixey, who is, of course, a vixen. That's the proper name for a female fox. But the hunter, with Copper helping him after the old hound was injured while chasing Tod, decides to cut the barbed wire fence of the game preserve and sneak in, bringing with him half a dozen or so steel traps. He's determined to get Tod, and so is Copper because he blames Tod for the old hound's injuries.Of course things don't quite go the way anyone planned, but I'm not going to tell you any more than that and spoil it for you.

347409,A3O72DJ2MQ8930,6302961572,"Bill ""william5916""","[0, 0]","A friend of mine brought over this DVD recently, practically insisting that I look at it.I remembered Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel reviewing ""The Fox and the Hound"" on the PBS show ""Sneak Previews"" during its theatrical release. As I recall, they were very impressed with the look of the film, which is reminiscent of early Disney classics such as ""Snow White,"" at least in terms of the gorgeous and realistic backgrounds...but I didn't recall them being overly enthusiastic about the plot.At my friend's insistence, I relented...and loved it! These days, it's rare for any movie to hold my attention and keep it held...but ""The Fox and the Hound"" managed that difficult task.If you're an overly protective parent, as some of the reviewers on these pages obviously are, stay away from this film. It has its share of Disney cuteness, but real-life dangers abound in the fantasy world that has been created. Yes, as some horrified parents have pointed out, there are guns. Yes, a gun is pointed at another human by an over-zealous hunter with a determined mean streak and spirit of vengeance. Yes, a hunter is depicted doing what hunters typically do. And, yes, characters that you end up caring for as the movie unfolds find themselves in life-threatening situations...but that's what makes this movie work. However, in typical Disney fashion, all ends well, fences are mended, and enemies even become friends...what's wrong with that?The plot is simple but engaging...a baby fox and hound, not realizing that they're supposed to be mortal enemies, befriend each other...but, as time goes by, adult roles take over, and the friendship sadly ends...or so it seems.The final 15 minutes or so of this film are absolutely absorbing/riveting, as the overly zealous/obsessed hunter and his faithful hound enter a protected game preserve to find/kill the fox that had trespassed upon his property several times in the past, when it had lived nearby as a pet of an elderly woman. It's obvious by this time that the fox and the hound's former friendship will reaffirm itself somehow, but the twist that Disney took at this point in the story wasn't the twist that I was expecting--happily so, as the path that the movie ended up taking was far more gripping/intense than ever anticipated...suffice it to say that I found myself wiping a tear or two away by the time this scene ended.If Walt Disney himself could see this movie, he might not be pleased with the animation as a whole--but I can't picture him disliking the tale that the talented folks associated with this film managed to weave.

What is that supposed to mean? Despite what some may say, I think nearly every Disney animated film from ""Snow White"" to the mid-90s are magical. (There are others past that, but those are what I consider their classics. Don't get me wrong, ""Lilo and Stitch"" is adorable, but I won't remember it 30 years from now like ""Aladdin"" or ""Bambi"". I think ""Brother Bear"" was a notable exception, perhaps.) ""The Fox and the Hound"" was one of my favorite Disney movies when I was probably in Kindergarten-2nd grade. It is such a simple story, but it's definitely one of the studio's most heartwarming. Like others have said, it's most certainly bittersweet. This is the story of a young Fox, whose mother is shot. A kindly old owl is concerned about the orphan and arranges for a kindly farmwoman to adopt him. Young Tod soon meets Copper, the hunter-neighbor's hound puppy. They form a dear friendship. However, Copper leaves to learn how to be a hunting dog and their friendship is never the same. I don't know who wrote the songs in this movie, but whoever did, I salute them. ""When You're the Best of Friends"" and ""Goodbye my Seem Forever"" (I'm not sure if those are the original titles, they're my best guesses.) are beautiful, heart-wrenching songs. I still remember them as a sixteen-year-old and I still adore them.

347425,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,6302961572,Einsatz,"[0, 0]","This is the film that caused a rift among the Disney animators.  The old guard wanted to handle the film `business as usual.'  The new animators, led by Don Bluth (who declared Disney's work ""stale""), wanted to go in another direction altogether.  When they couldn't get their way, eleven of them left to form their own studio.  New artists had to be hired, putting the production behind by a year.In the grand tradition of Disney and his many hatchet jobs on children's books, The Fox and the Hound is very loosely based on a book of the same name by Daniel P. Mannix.  Liberties were taken.  It took a slew of writers to come up with this unwarranted revision.  The story involves a mother fox abandoning her son while she goes off to be shot.  A kindly old widow woman is manipulated into taking in the young fox and raising him to be hunted by her gun happy neighbor.  At one point, the gun happy neighbor takes to shooting at the old woman as she drives down a road with her fox onboard.  It is made very clear early on that this neighbor will stop at nothing to kill this particular fox, including illegally trying to trap and shoot him in a protected game preserve (he also starts a fire in his haste to kill this particular fox).  Along the way, there is a momentary friendship between this fox and a hunting dog owned by the crazy neighbor.  This is soon discarded in favor of the hunt, with the hound dog anxious to kill his supposed friend.  If there's a lesson to be learned in all this anger and killing, I failed to find it.  There are also a few instantly forgettable tunes scattered throughout.  Some of the voice actors are immediately identifiable to the detriment of the characters.

347434,A7Y6AVS576M03,6302961572,gobirds2,"[59, 68]","Disney studio's 1981 production of THE FOX AND THE HOUND seems to have been made mostly by the newer generation of artists at the studio. The film's look is similar to 1977's THE RESCUERS. Dismissing the high strung and flamboyant personality traits possessed by the likes of Bernard and Miss Bianca from the previous film, THE FOX AND THE HOUND concentrates on the more homespun qualities that were created for the bayou characters. This folksy and laid-back approach bolstered by Pearl Bailey's songs sung as Big Mama Owl and Buddy Baker's unpretentious score at once sets THE FOX AND THE HOUND apart from previous Disney animated films. In fact this film has a very un-Disney look about it. The film leisurely unfolds a story about an orphaned fox named Tod adopted by Widow Tweed, a farming woman. Tod befriends a puppy named Copper owned by Widow Tweed's neighbor, the hunter Amos Slade, and they become friends. The fox and the hound make a pact of lifelong friendship. Inevitably after Copper is trained to be a hunting dog and they both grow up the two must confront each other. One is the hunter and one is the hunted as is ordained by nature. The film does not create genuinely frightful images thanks in part to the loosely drawn animation and its good-natured tone, yet its message is perhaps stronger than any Disney animated film. Things are much simpler when you are young. Once you grow up things appear in a much different light depending to what degree you were taught. The film uses the allegory of the fox and the hound, natural enemies in real life, and their pact of friendship to demonstrate the adversities of life's realities and the effects it has on each of us. This film seems deliberately aimed at very young viewers, yet its message spans the range of anyone old or young enough to comprehend it. I'll admit that this was never one of my favorite Disney films. Even my daughter did not like it. It is not showy or flashy. Even the animation is very simplistic. After watching it again recently I now see that I missed the film's payoff. As film viewers, the older we get the more sophisticated we become. Sophistication breeds complacency sometimes to the point where we miss the point! What looks like a cute little movie with fury animals on the surface to an adult, may be an emotionally awaking experience for a little child, a glimpse of what lies ahead. I think the filmmakers gave our young ones more credit for deductive feeling and emotion than we did. As an adult I found watching the first two thirds of this film a rather laborious task. The final third is where it comes alive and also comes full circle. For a very young child however, the entire film is very entertaining. For the very young child the lesson learned is a bonus. The payoff for me is the final scene where Copper begins to fall off to sleep and we hear an echoing voice of his pact of lifelong friendship to Tod that was made when they were children.

With the vocal talents of Jack Albertson, Jeanette Nolan, Mickey Rooney, and Kurt Russell, it shines as a latter-day Disney classic.The movie's enduring emotional power traces to its core bittersweet message.  Tod and Copper meet innocently in their youth and immediately become friends.  The movie's depiction of a realistic friendly relationship is genuinely heartwarming, and makes the inevitable later conflict between the natural enemies downright tragic in its symbolic implications.  Frankly, I still feel the emotional wallop when (SPOILER) a mature Copper steps in front of a downed Tod, preventing the hunter Amos Slade from killing the fox.  Jack Albertson, who had played the kindly Grandpa Joe a decade earlier in ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,"" has a genuinely mean role to play with Amos Slade, and appropriately turns in a hard-bitten vocal performance.  Jeanette Nolan is likable and sweet as the Widow Tweed, Tod's owner and Slade's neighbor.

It was one of the last films of the old guard until the transition to the highly popular animated musical ""The Little Mermaid"".

I totaly disagree with the amazon.com review saying that none of the main characters was very well developed personality wise! What does he want?!..........pretencious wise cracking one liners who try too hard to be witty like we see such an overdose of  these days ?!? What this film so strongly portrays in Todd the fox and Copper the hound is their childhold innocence, unclouded by the grim prejudices of the ""adult"" world that conditions you to hate because that is the way it is. The ending was truely moving and bittersweet  when their friendship is rekindled in the face of life and death but in the end they could never be friends because society would not let them.  I wish Disney  would make more metaphoric stories such as this because this is not your typical ""Disney"" movie where there is always a fairytale ending.

A very touching story indeed...the grand fanale!The lovely tale begins when a lonely widow adopts an orphaned fox cub  who she names Tod.  The mischievous fox soon meets up with Copper, an  adorable hound puppy. As the innocent pair grow up together in the forest,  they become inseparable friends.  While disobeying their families' wishes,  they create a very powerful bond during the course of the film, and you get  to know them well.  The reviewer for Amazon was wrong this time--this is  one of those timeless ones.  While it isn't &quot;Snow White&quot; or  &quot;Fantasia&quot;, &quot;The Fox and the Hound&quot; is a touching  movie, and children can learn a lot about friendship and bonding from it  while still being entertained.  However, be prewarned about the fanale  scene, in which Tod and Coper reunite to face an almighty bear.  This scene  is very intense, and the youngest children may be frightened by it.  &quot;New Disney's first real scenes of pure intensity are scattered  throughout the 1994 blockbuster &quot;The Lion King&quot;.

This was the first movie to ever truly touch my young heart.Watching this movie as a small child, I already had a vague concept of the message this story was trying to get across.  I knew nothing of the complexities of growing up, and the inevitabilities that come with it, but I could relate to the idea that different types of people just weren't supposed to associate with each other.. even if they wanted to.  Even as a tyke, it was easy for me to pick up on the broad idea of the movie - that good hearts come in all sorts of packages.As I've grown up and watched the video again over the years, I feel that it has grown with me.  The story of Todd and Copper has worked its way even further into my heart, now that I can understand everything that is being said here.  There's a lot to think about as the story touches on ecological issues and social roles and responsibilities, along with the hardship of growing up, and learning to say goodbye while cherishing a memory.Society and the world may be against the friendship of a fox and a hound, but Copper and Todd are able to overcome their dictated roles when it counts the most, and stay true to their friendship.The themes involved in The Fox and The Hound make my heart ache with sadness, and I never can make it through this film without shedding some bitter-sweet tears, but Disney balanced things out nicely by creating a very simple, charmingly animated, world to absorb it all in.  Everything is presented in a slow and simple manner, where we're not distracted by too much commotion, and can focus properly on the characters.  We know what drives them, we feel their joys and their sorrows.The ending is a beautiful sentiment; I get a pleasantly warm feeling from the reminder that, while people may grow apart, friendship is a sacred thing, to be cherished for a lifetime.",5,A Bitter-Sweet Story of Friendship,1107043200,"01 30, 2005",2005,1950,"['have', 'been', 'familiar', 'Disney', 'life', 'long', 'attained', 'classic', 'status', 'was', 'first', 'movie', 'ever', 'truly', 'touch', 'young', 'heart.Watching', 'movie', 'small', 'child', 'already', 'had', 'vague', 'concept', 'message', 'story', 'was', 'trying', 'get', 'knew', 'nothing', 'complexities', 'growing', 'up', 'inevitabilities', 'come', 'could', 'relate', 'idea', 'different', 'types', 'people', 'just', 'were', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'associate', 'other..', 'even', 'wanted', 'Even', 'tyke', 'was', 'easy', 'pick', 'up', 'broad', 'idea', 'movie', 'good', 'hearts', 'come', 'sorts', 'packages.As', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'up', 'watched', 'video', 'again', 'years', 'feel', 'grown', 'story', 'Todd', 'Copper', 'worked', 'way', 'even', 'further', 'heart', 'now', 'can', 'understand', 'everything', 'being', 'said', 'here', 'lot', 'think', 'story', 'touches', 'ecological', 'issues', 'social', 'roles', 'responsibilities', 'hardship', 'growing', 'up', 'learning', 'say', 'goodbye', 'cherishing', 'memory.Society', 'world', 'may', 'be', 'friendship', 'fox', 'hound', 'Copper', 'Todd', 'are', 'able', 'overcome', 'dictated', 'roles', 'when', 'most', 'stay', 'true', 'friendship.The', 'themes', 'involved', 'Fox', 'Hound', 'make', 'heart', 'ache', 'sadness', 'never', 'can', 'make', 'film', 'shedding', 'bitter-sweet', 'tears', 'Disney', 'balanced', 'things', 'out', 'nicely', 'creating', 'very', 'simple', 'charmingly', 'animated', 'world', 'absorb', 'Everything', 'presented', 'slow', 'simple', 'manner', 'where', ""'re"", 'not', 'distracted', 'too', 'much', 'commotion', 'can', 'focus', 'properly', 'characters', 'know', 'what', 'feel', 'joys', 'sorrows.The', 'ending', 'beautiful', 'sentiment', 'get', 'pleasantly', 'warm', 'feeling', 'reminder', 'people', 'may', 'grow', 'apart', 'friendship', 'sacred', 'thing', 'be', 'cherished', 'lifetime']",N/A

I knew, right then, that it would remain my  number one favorite for all time.  Now that it's been re-released for video  and dvd, I'm as happy as a songbird.  I consider this movie to be Disney's  best.  Sure you've heard that said about lots of Disney movies before.  Why  is this one different?  First of all, like some of the best of the old  movies, The Fox and the Hound has a lot of good lessons, the most important  being friendship.  The characters are enchanting and heartwarming, and some  are even very well developed characters, leading convincing lives with rich  emotional relationships.  This movie has no need for hokey humor with puns  and jokes, and it doesn't have the standard good versus evil formula.  Considering this and the lessons, this movie makes even the best of the new  Disney look like Saturday morning cartoons.  The drama and emotional level  in this movie are amazing.  If you haven't seen it yet, don't be surprised  to find your kids hiding.  And don't expect a dry eye either.  The songs  aren't anything you'll want on a soundtrack, but they're still very nice,  and the subdued approach allows for the story to flow.  This movie has all  the heart of Bambi but has a more realistic, more personal story.  The new  Disney may make very nice movies, but they still can't touch a story about  friendship.  Also, while the new Disney movies seem to reward violence,  this movie shows the consequences of violence and rewards true friendship.  The Fox and the Hound proves that old school is still the best, and this is  certainly the best of the best.  Pick it up.  It'll make a fine addition to  the collection.",5,Old school Disney is still the best,957571200,"05 6, 2000",2000,1817,"['Ever', 'got', 'reintroduced', 'Fox', 'Hound', 'back', 'when', 'first', 'got', 'released', 'video', 'was', 'simply', 'amazed', 'how', 'fantastic', 'heartwarming', 'movie', 'was', 'knew', 'right', 'then', 'would', 'remain', 'number', 'one', 'favorite', 'time', 'Now', 'been', 're-released', 'video', 'dvd', ""'m"", 'as', 'happy', 'songbird', 'consider', 'movie', 'be', 'Disney', 'best', 'Sure', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'said', 'lots', 'Disney', 'movies', 'Why', 'one', 'different', 'First', 'all', 'best', 'old', 'movies', 'Fox', 'Hound', 'lot', 'good', 'lessons', 'most', 'important', 'being', 'friendship', 'characters', 'are', 'enchanting', 'heartwarming', 'are', 'even', 'very', 'well', 'developed', 'characters', 'leading', 'convincing', 'lives', 'rich', 'emotional', 'relationships', 'movie', 'need', 'hokey', 'humor', 'puns', 'jokes', ""n't"", 'have', 'standard', 'good', 'versus', 'evil', 'formula', 'Considering', 'lessons', 'movie', 'even', 'best', 'new', 'Disney', 'look', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'cartoons', 'drama', 'emotional', 'level', 'movie', 'are', 'amazing', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'find', 'kids', 'hiding', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'dry', 'eye', 'songs', 'are', ""n't"", 'anything', ""'ll"", 'want', 'soundtrack', ""'re"", 'still', 'very', 'nice', 'subdued', 'approach', 'story', 'flow', 'movie', 'heart', 'Bambi', 'more', 'realistic', 'more', 'personal', 'story', 'new', 'Disney', 'may', 'make', 'very', 'nice', 'movies', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'touch', 'story', 'friendship', 'Also', 'new', 'Disney', 'movies', 'seem', 'reward', 'violence', 'movie', 'consequences', 'violence', 'rewards', 'true', 'friendship', 'Fox', 'Hound', 'old', 'school', 'still', 'best', 'certainly', 'best', 'best', 'Pick', 'up', ""'ll"", 'make', 'fine', 'addition', 'collection']",N/A

As youngsters they start out as friends, but when they become adults their friendship is tested when Chief, another dog, falls from a railroad bridge and is injured. Copper vows to go after Tod and kills him because he blames him for Chief's broken leg. The main climax in this movie is when Amos Slade, Copper's owner, and Copper go hunting after Tod and run into a three hundred pound black bear. Just as the black bear is to kill Copper, Tod comes to rescue his friend. You can guest the rest of this movie. The Fox and the Hound have a few lasts in it.

347468,A42GFMF12V7XR,6302961572,Paul J. Mular,"[71, 80]","O.K. I can answer the many questions about the correct screen ratio of THE FOX AND THE HOUND.I was a movie projectionist at the time and I had access to look at a 1988 re-release 35mm print of the movie and it was FULL FRAME!  Yes, the movie is 1:33 to 1 ,  NOT WIDESCREEN!You have to understand the thinking of 1980's Hollywood.  Theaters were getting smaller, all movies ended up on television, and VHS & Beta home video tapes were becoming the popular way to watch movies.  Therefore, many producers started filming their movies in the full frame television format, knowing that it is the way most people would see the film then.Paramount even shot all of their 1980's comedies in full frame.  Airplane I & II; Naked Gun I, II, III;  Addams Family I & II; The Bette Midler movies , Throw Mama from the Train are part of the countless list of FULL FRAME movies that DVD is offering in a masked 1:85-1 format.We should be glad that Buena Vista is offering THE FOX & THE HOUND in the ratio that it was produced.The movie itself falls short of a Disney Classic.  It seems any Disney movie short on songs seems to be overall less appealing.  The basic story line is good and could have made for a very successful classic, but the execution of the story lacks the right elements.This new release is no big deal,  you gain a short behind-the-scenes clip that appears to be pulled from another special and you lose the 1988 theatrical trailer on the original DVD release.  That's right, the FIRST DVD RELEASE EXTRA OF THE PREVIEW TRAILER HAS BEEN DELETED HERE!The movie itself has gotten NO RESTORATION, but my opinion is that it still looks good on a regular large TV.I was hoping of the Angela Lansbury TV special done in the early 1980's that showed some behind the scenes of the making of The Fox and the Hound, but sadly that is not to be here.Bottom line:If you missed the first DVD release, then buy this.If you have the first DVD release you can pass on this unless you are a Disney completist.",4,Correct screen ratio!

347483,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,6302961572,trebe,"[0, 0]","With many of the classic Disney elements, The Fox and the Hound (1981) is an enjoyable and entertaining tale, featuring a rather unlikely friendship of two traditional foes.  The story is not that well-developed, and somewhat disturbing at times, and while not totally engrossing emotionally, there are still some moments that will genuinely touch the heart.When his mother is killed by hunters, a young fox is left alone in the world.  Only with the help of an Owl named Big Mama (Pearl Bailey), and Boomer (Paul Winchell) and Dinky (Richard Bakalyan), a pair of helpful birds, is the young orphan able to find a home, when he is taken in by the Widow Tweed (Jeanette Nolan), who lovingly names him Tod.  The innocent youngster soon makes friends with a young puppy named Cooper (Kurt Russell) who arrives at the adjoining property.  Neighbor Amos Slade (Jack Albertson) is a hunter, and plans use his old hunting dog named Chief (Pat Butram), to help him to train Cooper to become a hunting dog as well.Tod sneaking over to see his pal Cooper, soon gets both friends in trouble, as Slade, who definitely has some anger management issues, eventually picks up his gun, heads to the Widow Tweed's and starts shooting at her car, trying to kill the young fox.  The Widow bravely defends Tod, and sends Slade packing.As winter approaches, Slade leaves home on a hunting excursion, taking both his dogs.  When spring arrives, Tod has grown up, while Cooper is now huge, as has become a seasoned hunting dog.  Tod believes that he can renew their friendship, but things have definitely changed, when Chief is injured and Slade once again barges over to the Widow's property with his gun.Like many Disney features, The Fox And The Hound features the classic situation of the loss of parents and the struggle for survival.  The film focuses on the relationship between Tod and Cooper, although their screentime together as youngsters is quite brief.  Little attention is given to the key role the Widow Tweed plays in Tod's life, yet the film's most touching moments occur, when the Widow is preparing to release Tod into the wilderness, as she recalls what they have meant to each other.  Big Mama also plays a pivotal role in Tod's life, and Pearl Bailey also contributes some wonderful singing particularly on the signature song `When You're The Best Of Friends'.For the most part, Slade is borderline psychotic in his desire to kill Tod.  While his maniacal anger does provide the drive for much of the film, and Jack Albertson does a great job as his voice, it still makes for rather disturbing viewing at times, like when the hunter fires upon the Widow, and manically chases after Tod, even in a wilderness preserve.  Having Slade and the Widow together at the end, seems like a mixed message, but then Disney is usually about rough beginnings and happy endings.  The friendship between Tod and Cooper just doesn't seem enduring or that endearing.  There is some redemption in the end, as each one does take a risk for the other, but the events that lead up to it don't quite lay the proper foundation for such loyalty.One relationship that seems natural is between Tod, and lady fox Vixey (Sandy Duncan).  The character development for Tod is a little confusing, as even when he is older, he sometimes acts like a little kid, but that's probably due to his lack of experience in the wild.  Mickey Rooney, who is the voice of the older Tod, does what he can with the role, but perhaps was not the ideal choice.  The old dog Chief, has a more complicated personality than you might expect, with Pat Butram (Mr. Haney on Green Acres) turning in a very solid performance.Image quality on the 25th Anniversary edition is soft in many places, but the animation is quite good, particularly the chase and action scenes.  The big battle at the end with the enraged giant bear is very exciting, though perhaps slightly intense for younger kids.  The Fox And The Hound isn't perfect, but the film's genuinely warm moments, featuring Tod, Widow Tweed, and his feathered friends, along with the climactic finish, make it well worth watching.
