743022,A3DM6UGX44NJ9K,B00008J2F4,"Daigo Parry ""Hodor""","[3, 4]","What seems to be Earth's largest and most popular online role-playing game community continues to be unbalanced by Tsukasa, a player trapped in ""The World,"" which is accessed with the use of a headset with goggles. Strange alliances form: B.T. wavers between her friends Mimiru and Bear, to work with the deadly player-killer Sora, who is also working with the law-enforcing Crimson Knights, who are acting without the knowledge of their leader, Lady Subaru, to separate Tsukasa from his monster/guardian and capture him.Confused? You will be if this is your first "".hack"" DVD. You cannot start this in mid-series. The plot, which moves slowly and is filled with philosophizing and conversation, requires a good knowledge of computers, online communities and gaming, and an open mind.This episode also showcases .hack's double-edged sword, character development, which is both it's best aspect and its worst. All the main characters continue to be fleshed out: the Crimson Knights' squad leader as a frustrated but obedient soldier; Lady Subaru as a curious woman, with waning leadership skills; Crim, as a truly good-intentioned heavy swordsman, as well as the continuing growth of Mimiru and Bear. However, they introduce a first time player named A-20, who attaches herself to Mimiru, and like Tsukasa, is awkward with meeting people. Mimiru takes her to a dungeon event to boost her experience points, etcetera. This is the last you will see of A-20. Why bring her into the series? Just a few more of these character-types will show up in .hack: barely introduced players with no major impact on the plot other than in the episode they appear in.Again, my displeasure with the way the series ends and the plot and character holes it leaves may all be wrong, depending on how and if they continue and finish this series. As it ends, you are left with more questions (although many are answered) than closure by the time you roll through the credits of the 26th and final episode, in what I'm hoping is only the first season. If there is more to follow, .hack can be great. If there isn't, what a letdown of an ending.Tremendous art, great, but sometimes overwhelming and overused music, and awesome vocal performances on both sides (Japanese and English). Put on the subtitles and watch in Japanese for a deeper, more confusing philosophical take, and watch in English for a more Cartoon Network, user-friendly perspective.

743023,A1ARL0WOQZ2VVJ,B00008J2F4,"""iso_allen""","[5, 5]","The second installment of .hack//sign continues to deepen the mysteries surrounding Tsukasa and his involvement in ""The World"". More debates arise behind the existance of the Key of Twilight and secret alliances are formed as players try to out do each other in the search.You will either love it or hate it. The entire ""World"" is based off of a online fantasy role playing world in which people who play the game from their PC's can wander the ""World"" and interact with others who are playing (having played many RPG's I can relate to the World). 99% of the anime takes place in the ""World"" and the art style used in the anime is consistant with that concept.Tsukasa is different from the other players in the fact that he is trapped inside the game and isn't bound to the same rules and limitations that all the other players are. The other characters in the game all seem to be after him for reasons that may be obvious or obscure, but Tsukasa only wants to left alone.The pace is intentionaly slow. Which I don't consider bad in the way that it has been done. The players have a mystery to figure out and problems (with-in themselves and between each other)that need to be addressed.  I wouldn't call this a action series even though there is action. This series addresses concepts, ideas, and personal issues through the characters interaction with each other. Its a journey of discovery that can't be forced but has to be realized. In this sense I think the slow pacing works well.The soundtrack that comes with this DVD has a lot of great music. I would have to say that the quality of the music in the animation and on the soundtrack are among the best aspects of the show. Most of it is slow, with a sense of mystery and wonder that is reflected throughout the series.",5,The mystery deepens...,1052784000,"05 13, 2003",2003,1777,"['second', 'installment', '.hack//sign', 'deepen', 'mysteries', 'surrounding', 'Tsukasa', 'involvement', 'World', 'More', 'debates', 'arise', 'existance', 'Key', 'Twilight', 'secret', 'alliances', 'are', 'formed', 'players', 'try', 'out', 'do', 'other', 'search.You', 'will', 'love', 'hate', 'entire', 'World', 'based', 'online', 'fantasy', 'role', 'playing', 'world', 'people', 'who', 'play', 'game', 'PC', 'can', 'wander', 'World', 'interact', 'others', 'who', 'are', 'playing', 'having', 'played', 'many', 'RPG', 'can', 'relate', 'World', '99', '%', 'anime', 'place', 'World', 'art', 'style', 'used', 'anime', 'consistant', 'concept.Tsukasa', 'different', 'other', 'players', 'fact', 'trapped', 'game', ""n't"", 'bound', 'same', 'rules', 'limitations', 'other', 'players', 'are', 'other', 'characters', 'game', 'seem', 'be', 'reasons', 'may', 'be', 'obvious', 'obscure', 'Tsukasa', 'only', 'left', 'alone.The', 'pace', 'intentionaly', 'slow', 'Which', 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'bad', 'way', 'been', 'done', 'players', 'have', 'mystery', 'figure', 'out', 'problems', 'with-in', 'other', 'need', 'be', 'addressed', 'would', ""n't"", 'call', 'action', 'series', 'even', 'action', 'series', 'concepts', 'ideas', 'personal', 'issues', 'characters', 'interaction', 'other', 'journey', 'discovery', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'forced', 'be', 'realized', 'sense', 'think', 'slow', 'pacing', 'well.The', 'soundtrack', 'DVD', 'lot', 'great', 'music', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'quality', 'music', 'animation', 'soundtrack', 'are', 'best', 'aspects', 'show', 'Most', 'slow', 'sense', 'mystery', 'wonder', 'reflected', 'series']",.hack//SIGN: Outcast - Volume 2

743025,A1KAUV9QYLP52J,B00008J2F4,Kellyannl,"[3, 4]","SIGN continues as Tsukasa's situation is further explored and we get character studies of Mimiru and Bear - two of the three people, along with Subaru, who will ultimately be closest to him throughout his ordeal.As this volume begins, a distraught Mimiru - who of course has no way of knowing yet that Subaru means Tsukasa no harm - is desperate enough to ask Sora to help break him out.  This he does in outrageous fashion, though not without a run in with Subaru's friend Crim.  Considering that Sora's game strategy offends Crim's sense of chivalry and Sora is more than a little annoyed at being fought to a draw, it's pretty much loathing at first sight for the two - beginning a rivalry that will continue through the penultimate episode of the series.  Tsukasa, meanwhile, bolts and runs.Thus begins Mimiru's highly amusing subplot as, while waiting to see if Tsukasa reaches out to her again, she's used and abused by a newbie named A-20 who she tries to help.  To add insult to injury, much to her dismay she also seems to have become Sora's new best buddy - and can't simply brush him off because he's started to feed her accurate information from a hacker named Helba that might eventually help Tsukasa.  Fans who do like Sora - and there are more than a few - will likely point to these episodes when asked why.  His strange sense of humour can be infectious, and while he obviously knows that his best chance of finding Tsukasa is probably by sticking to her like a bad penny, he gets more chatty with Mimiru than he really has to, at one point even more or less revealing what kind of person he is in the real world - something that you may have already guessed.Meanwhile, B.T. is mildly worried about Bear, who's in an uncharacteristic depression that seems to run deeper than some disturbing suspicions he has about Tsukasa's real identity.  We get a look into his personal life that gives us a sense of why he's so affected by Tsukasa's plight and why one of his preferred gaming partners is a young girl who has to be less than half his age.By the end of the volume, Mimiru and Bear's efforts have results.  They've reached out to Tsukasa, and spurred by a miserable day he hesitantly responds.  They can now begin the task of trying to help him in earnest, and the story is truly underway.",4,The story deepens.,1087948800,"06 23, 2004",2004,2308,"['SIGN', 'Tsukasa', 'situation', 'further', 'explored', 'get', 'character', 'studies', 'Mimiru', 'Bear', 'two', 'three', 'people', 'Subaru', 'who', 'will', 'ultimately', 'be', 'closest', 'ordeal.As', 'volume', 'distraught', 'Mimiru', 'who', 'course', 'way', 'knowing', 'Subaru', 'Tsukasa', 'harm', 'desperate', 'enough', 'ask', 'Sora', 'help', 'break', 'out', 'outrageous', 'fashion', 'not', 'run', 'Subaru', 'friend', 'Crim', 'Considering', 'Sora', 'game', 'strategy', 'Crim', 'sense', 'chivalry', 'Sora', 'more', 'little', 'annoyed', 'being', 'fought', 'draw', 'pretty', 'much', 'loathing', 'first', 'sight', 'two', 'beginning', 'rivalry', 'will', 'continue', 'penultimate', 'episode', 'series', 'Tsukasa', 'meanwhile', 'bolts', 'runs.Thus', 'Mimiru', 'highly', 'amusing', 'subplot', 'waiting', 'see', 'Tsukasa', 'out', 'again', 'used', 'abused', 'newbie', 'named', 'A-20', 'who', 'help', 'add', 'insult', 'injury', 'much', 'dismay', 'also', 'have', 'become', 'Sora', 'new', 'best', 'buddy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'simply', 'brush', 'off', 'started', 'feed', 'accurate', 'information', 'hacker', 'named', 'Helba', 'might', 'eventually', 'help', 'Tsukasa', 'Fans', 'who', 'do', 'Sora', 'are', 'more', 'few', 'will', 'likely', 'point', 'episodes', 'when', 'asked', 'why', 'strange', 'sense', 'humour', 'can', 'be', 'infectious', 'obviously', 'best', 'chance', 'finding', 'Tsukasa', 'probably', 'sticking', 'bad', 'penny', 'more', 'chatty', 'Mimiru', 'really', 'one', 'point', 'even', 'more', 'less', 'revealing', 'what', 'kind', 'person', 'real', 'world', 'something', 'may', 'have', 'already', 'guessed.Meanwhile', 'B.T', 'mildly', 'worried', 'Bear', 'who', 'uncharacteristic', 'depression', 'run', 'deeper', 'disturbing', 'suspicions', 'Tsukasa', 'real', 'identity', 'get', 'look', 'personal', 'life', 'sense', 'why', 'so', 'affected', 'Tsukasa', 'plight', 'why', 'one', 'preferred', 'gaming', 'partners', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'be', 'less', 'age.By', 'end', 'volume', 'Mimiru', 'Bear', 'efforts', 'have', 'results', ""'ve"", 'reached', 'out', 'Tsukasa', 'spurred', 'miserable', 'day', 'hesitantly', 'can', 'now', 'begin', 'task', 'trying', 'help', 'earnest', 'story', 'truly', 'underway']",.hack//SIGN: Outcast - Volume 2

Tsukasa simply wants to be left alone, to hide away.  To the frustration of all who would be either friend or enemy to the mysterious wavemaster.  Especially for poor Mimiru, who has developed an affection for Tsukasa, but seems unable to elicit any response other than rejection.In one of the more humorous asides of this DVD, Mimiru becomes determined to wait for him to talk to her, but has no idea how to accomplish it.  So Tsukasa hides in a secret land waiting for a mysterious sleeper in white to awaken, while Mimiru waits on a dock for Tsukasa for finally come to her to talk.  Theirs is a relationship made for a Pinter play - all efforts to communicate seem to just miss each other.This complexity underlies the story so far, full of mysteries like the Key of the Twilight that refuse to materialize into something useful.  BT starts to work with Sora, a twin sword with a black sense of humor, and Bear finds his family life overlapping into The World.  We see more of Tsukasa's past.  Far from being a dungeons and dragons story like the game that stands at the center of this series, the characters are the most important part of this series.For the most part the DVD raises questions rather than provides answers, but this is vital to the continuity, and prevents the overall effect from being episodic.  All of the three major parts of .hack (game, series, and OVA) are investigations into an evil that underlies the glittering virtual invention known as the world.  But deeper questions of purpose are also raised.  Perhaps, as Mia in the game declares, some things are valuable because they are futile.The animation and graphics in this series continue to be second to those of the OVA included with the game, but are strong for a TV series.  Again a CD of the music is includes as an extra.  My only issue with that is that several things are fine as background music, or as excerpts, but seem a little pretentious and silly when they receive extended performance.
