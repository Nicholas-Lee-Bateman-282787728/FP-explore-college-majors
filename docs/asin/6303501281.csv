378052,A4PSENWF6S5LV,6303501281,"A. Dunn ""alligirl""","[0, 0]","FINALLY!  I loved this movie when I was younger, having seen it when it had first been released. I had the most difficult time finding it on DVD.After it being so long since I had last seen it I was a little nervous on how it would hold up against the test of time.  Of course the fact that it was essentially a period piece helped.  I find that period pieces have the best chances of not being ruined when watched years later.  Circle of Friends stands up to that test of time and comes out fairly well.  Of course it's decades later and I know what Chris O'Donnell looks like all grown up (same with the ever gorgeous Minnie Driver).  I also understand the content a little better now that I'm not a little girl watching a movie solely because 'the cute boy from The Three Musketeers' was in it.  I understand Nan's situation with Colin Firth (who is adorably young, although a total cad) and the tragedy of Bernie's failed romance.  I'm so glad I finally found it",5,Circle of Friends stands up to that test of time and comes out fairly well...,1374969600,"07 28, 2013",2013,966,"['FINALLY', 'loved', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'having', 'seen', 'when', 'had', 'first', 'been', 'released', 'had', 'most', 'difficult', 'time', 'finding', 'DVD.After', 'being', 'so', 'long', 'had', 'last', 'seen', 'was', 'little', 'nervous', 'how', 'would', 'hold', 'up', 'test', 'time', 'course', 'fact', 'was', 'essentially', 'period', 'piece', 'helped', 'find', 'period', 'pieces', 'have', 'best', 'chances', 'not', 'being', 'ruined', 'when', 'watched', 'years', 'later', 'Circle', 'Friends', 'up', 'test', 'time', 'out', 'fairly', 'well', 'course', 'decades', 'later', 'know', 'what', 'Chris', ""O'Donnell"", 'grown', 'up', 'same', 'ever', 'gorgeous', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'also', 'understand', 'content', 'little', 'better', 'now', ""'m"", 'not', 'little', 'girl', 'watching', 'movie', 'solely', ""'the"", 'cute', 'boy', 'Three', 'Musketeers', 'was', 'understand', 'Nan', 'situation', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'who', 'adorably', 'young', 'total', 'cad', 'tragedy', 'Bernie', 'failed', 'romance', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'finally', 'found']",Circle of Friends VHS
378053,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6303501281,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","This charming little film deals with the relationships of three young girls in 1950&#8217;s Ireland.  As they grow up and begin to attend college, their relationships shift as boys enter the picture and religious and social stigmas begin to pry into their budding sexuality.  Benny, the frumpy introverted one, finds the eyes of Jack, a social and popular athlete.  Nan, the beautiful and confident one, falls for a wealthy, older man and soon her decisions start to fray the fibers of her relationships with Benny and even threaten Benny&#8217;s relationship with Jack.This was the rise of Driver&#8217;s star (where is she?) and happened right in the crux of O&#8217;Donnell&#8217;s rise to fame.  It has a lot of charm and Driver is wonderful here.  Sadly, the film suffers in its development of two key characters and winds up being somewhat irritating because of it.  Alan Cumming and Colin Firth are saddled with truly terrible characters who are developed in the most clich&eacute;d of ways, especially Cumming, who portrays a complete and total creep.  The idea that no one but Benny notices how creepy he is is a problem, since he&#8217;s so obvious about it all.Still, the film is sweet and has charm and looks beautiful, so for a film of this nature I highly recommend it.",4,A charming little film&#8230;,1383782400,"11 7, 2013",2013,1283,"['charming', 'little', 'film', 'deals', 'relationships', 'three', 'young', 'girls', '1950', '8217', 's', 'Ireland', 'grow', 'up', 'begin', 'attend', 'college', 'relationships', 'shift', 'boys', 'enter', 'picture', 'religious', 'social', 'stigmas', 'begin', 'pry', 'budding', 'sexuality', 'Benny', 'frumpy', 'introverted', 'one', 'eyes', 'Jack', 'social', 'popular', 'athlete', 'Nan', 'beautiful', 'confident', 'one', 'wealthy', 'older', 'man', 'soon', 'decisions', 'start', 'fray', 'fibers', 'relationships', 'Benny', 'even', 'threaten', 'Benny', '8217', 'relationship', 'Jack.This', 'was', 'rise', 'Driver', '8217', 'star', 'where', 'happened', 'right', 'crux', 'O', '8217', 'Donnell', '8217', 'rise', 'fame', 'lot', 'charm', 'Driver', 'wonderful', 'here', 'Sadly', 'film', 'suffers', 'development', 'two', 'key', 'characters', 'up', 'being', 'somewhat', 'irritating', 'Alan', 'Cumming', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'are', 'saddled', 'truly', 'terrible', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'developed', 'most', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'ways', 'especially', 'Cumming', 'who', 'complete', 'total', 'creep', 'idea', 'one', 'Benny', 'how', 'creepy', 'problem', '8217', 'so', 'obvious', 'film', 'sweet', 'charm', 'beautiful', 'so', 'film', 'nature', 'highly', 'recommend']",Circle of Friends VHS

It was so interesting to watch Chris O'Donnell and Minnie Driver in their early years......from their performances, I can see why they are such stars today. They are wonderful actors.Driver's character, Benny, sees herself as unattractive and dumpy. She plays the role to perfection, with a touching sensitivity. O'Donnell plays Jack, a star rugby player with a big heart and a conscience, but a young man who is somewhat indecisive and not as confident as he appears to be.The characters are all portrayed with great honesty, humor, and grace while they learn lessons about friendship, loyalty, love, and life.Although sweet and endearing, this movie is never sappy and the characters never ask us to feel sorry for them.The cinematography was beautiful and the lilting Irish music was a wonderful compliment to the scenery of this gorgeous country.A thought-provoking film with a message.",5,What a treasure!,1030060800,"08 23, 2002",2002,1014,"['just', 'watched', 'lovely', 'little', 'gem', 'second', 'time', 'had', 'forgotten', 'what', 'truly', 'charming', 'well-done', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'interesting', 'watch', 'Chris', ""O'Donnell"", 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'early', 'years', 'performances', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'are', 'such', 'stars', 'today', 'are', 'wonderful', 'actors.Driver', 'character', 'Benny', 'unattractive', 'dumpy', 'role', 'perfection', 'touching', 'sensitivity', ""O'Donnell"", 'Jack', 'star', 'rugby', 'player', 'big', 'heart', 'conscience', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'somewhat', 'indecisive', 'not', 'as', 'confident', 'be.The', 'characters', 'are', 'portrayed', 'great', 'honesty', 'humor', 'grace', 'learn', 'lessons', 'friendship', 'loyalty', 'love', 'life.Although', 'sweet', 'endearing', 'movie', 'never', 'sappy', 'characters', 'never', 'ask', 'feel', 'sorry', 'them.The', 'cinematography', 'was', 'beautiful', 'lilting', 'Irish', 'music', 'was', 'wonderful', 'compliment', 'scenery', 'gorgeous', 'country.A', 'thought-provoking', 'film', 'message']",Circle of Friends VHS

It is about three girls who are best friends since early childhood.  All but one live in poverty.  They grow up and go to college in Dublin.  Two of the girls fall in love; the third wants to marry for money.  Bennie, the girl who lives in relative comfort, falls in love first with a boy named Jack.  Her parents, however, want to set her up with a sleazy man who works for them in her father's shop. Eve is being brought up by nuns in a very strict environment.  The third friend lives in dire poverty with an alcoholic father.  It is she that wants to marry for money.The movie is sweet and poignant, with the inevitable ups and downs of girls in love, betrayals by each other and by men.

378057,A1ERZIZ48CBCSB,6303501281,Charismatic Creature,"[8, 11]","Maeve Binchy's novel is not a classic, but has some charm and a definite sense of a particular time and place (small Irish village in the 50s) and a nicely drawn protagonist. It's a shame that this film completely butchers the theme of the book in order to pander to what the filmmakers must assume are American simpletons who have to have a happy romantic ending.SPOILER ALERTWell, just barely but you should know before seeing this that in the novel, Benny Hogan and Jack Foley BREAK UP at the end and do not get back together nor do they ever have sex. This is a far more realistic and satisfying ending, as Benny realizes that Jack is shallow and unworthy of her love and that she is now a mature, self-actualized adult who can move on. The movie wallows in a very unbelievable scenario where &quot;all is forgiven&quot;, because of course the sweet heroine MUST get the handsome hunk. Thus the entire point of the book is utterly lost.Along with that, so is virtually half the contents of the novel, including the story of Eve and the various colorful residents of Knockglen. This is a rather huge problem, since the book is about a &quot;Circle of Friends&quot; and if you make the story entirely about ONE of the friends, then that concept is rendered meaningless. Basically, what remains is the story of one nice girl (Benny) and one bitchy girl (Nan, played by the lovely Saffron Burrows).That being said, Minnie Driver is adorable and brimming with charm as Benny, although Benny is supposed to be overweight and plain and Ms. Driver is merely &quot;very attractive in a down-to-earth way&quot;. She commands the screen entirely with her appealing and realistic performance. Too bad the costume designers and hair stylists couldn't have found some 50s clothing and hairstyles for her -- no girl in the 50s would have been caught dead with &quot;big hair&quot;.On the other hand, Chris O'Donnell feels awkward as miscast as Jack. He looks too young for Benny (of course, all the cast is pretty much too old to be playing 18 yr old college freshman), and he doesn't convey the shallow side of Jack's character...of course, that could be the director or screenwriter forcing it to the back, since in the film Jack is Benny's true love and they end up together!Look for Alan Cummings, Colin Firth (as well as the aforementioned Saffron Burrows) in supporting roles...all these fine actors have gone on to do much substantial work in the last decade. But this is really Minnie Driver's show -- she made her Hollywood career with this delightful portrayal and it's worth sitting through the muddled script to enjoy two hours with her. I think this remains her finest film role. The two stars are entirely for her; otherwise this film would rate a big zero.",2,Radically changed from original novel,1090886400,"07 27, 2004",2004,2760,"['Maeve', 'Binchy', 'novel', 'not', 'classic', 'charm', 'definite', 'sense', 'particular', 'time', 'place', 'small', 'Irish', 'village', '50s', 'nicely', 'drawn', 'protagonist', 'shame', 'film', 'completely', 'theme', 'book', 'order', 'pander', 'what', 'filmmakers', 'must', 'assume', 'are', 'American', 'simpletons', 'who', 'have', 'have', 'happy', 'romantic', 'ending.SPOILER', 'ALERTWell', 'just', 'barely', 'should', 'know', 'seeing', 'novel', 'Benny', 'Hogan', 'Jack', 'Foley', 'BREAK', 'UP', 'end', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'do', 'ever', 'have', 'sex', 'far', 'more', 'realistic', 'satisfying', 'ending', 'Benny', 'Jack', 'shallow', 'unworthy', 'love', 'now', 'mature', 'self-actualized', 'adult', 'who', 'can', 'move', 'movie', 'very', 'unbelievable', 'scenario', 'where', 'quot', 'forgiven', 'quot', 'course', 'sweet', 'heroine', 'MUST', 'get', 'handsome', 'hunk', 'Thus', 'entire', 'point', 'book', 'utterly', 'lost.Along', 'so', 'virtually', 'contents', 'novel', 'including', 'story', 'Eve', 'various', 'colorful', 'residents', 'Knockglen', 'rather', 'huge', 'problem', 'book', 'quot', 'Circle', 'Friends', 'quot', 'make', 'story', 'entirely', 'ONE', 'friends', 'then', 'concept', 'rendered', 'meaningless', 'Basically', 'what', 'story', 'one', 'nice', 'girl', 'Benny', 'one', 'bitchy', 'girl', 'Nan', 'played', 'lovely', 'Saffron', 'Burrows', 'being', 'said', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'adorable', 'brimming', 'charm', 'Benny', 'Benny', 'supposed', 'be', 'overweight', 'plain', 'Ms.', 'Driver', 'merely', 'quot', 'very', 'attractive', 'down-to-earth', 'way', 'quot', 'screen', 'entirely', 'appealing', 'realistic', 'performance', 'Too', 'bad', 'costume', 'designers', 'hair', 'stylists', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'found', '50s', 'clothing', 'hairstyles', 'girl', '50s', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'caught', 'dead', 'quot', 'big', 'hair', 'quot', 'other', 'hand', 'Chris', ""O'Donnell"", 'awkward', 'as', 'miscast', 'Jack', 'too', 'young', 'Benny', 'course', 'cast', 'pretty', 'much', 'too', 'old', 'be', 'playing', '18', 'yr', 'old', 'college', 'freshman', ""n't"", 'convey', 'shallow', 'side', 'Jack', 'character', 'course', 'could', 'be', 'director', 'screenwriter', 'forcing', 'back', 'film', 'Jack', 'Benny', 'true', 'love', 'end', 'up', 'together', 'Look', 'Alan', 'Cummings', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'as', 'well', 'aforementioned', 'Saffron', 'Burrows', 'supporting', 'roles', 'fine', 'actors', 'have', 'gone', 'do', 'much', 'substantial', 'work', 'last', 'decade', 'really', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'show', 'made', 'Hollywood', 'career', 'delightful', 'portrayal', 'worth', 'sitting', 'muddled', 'script', 'enjoy', 'two', 'hours', 'think', 'finest', 'film', 'role', 'two', 'stars', 'are', 'entirely', 'otherwise', 'film', 'would', 'rate', 'big', 'zero']",Circle of Friends VHS

It is one of my all-time favorite books.  I guess that does a disservice to the movie because if I had seen it first, I am sure I would have appreciated it much more.The best thing about the movie was the casting of the main characters.  Minnie Driver is beyond excellent as Benny.  She is gorgeous, poignant in the role.  Eve, who is such an important part of the book, is almost totally overlooked in the movie, along with her life growing up as an orphan in the convent.There were just so many important pieces left out of the film, such as life in the village, Benny's parents, Nan's parents.  And why change the whole ending of the book?  To me that just made less of Benny and didn't show her true integrity.My suggestion:  read the book.  It is written so descriptively and with such character development, you will be able to visualize it as you read anyway.  If they were going to make this movie based on such a masterpiece, they should have lengthened it and really did a more true adaptation of Binchy's finest work.This is not a terrible film.  There are many good things about it - casting, scenery, fair story.

The story revolves around three friends with very different aspirations.  Minnie Driver plays Bennie Hogan, a frumpy young lady who is destined to spend the rest of her life running her families tailoring shop in her small home town.  She is forever plagued by the attention of her fathers assistant, played by Alan Cumming (who plays sleazy rat very well) and becomes smitten with local college boy Jack Foley (Chris O'Donnell).  Benny has two best friends, Eve and Nan.  Nan is played by English Temptress Saffron Burrows.  She wants to get out of the small town and she thinks that her meal ticket is rich boy Simon Westward (Colin Firth).  Little does she know, Simon is just using her as a plaything and has no intention of ever making her his wife.  When Nan turns up pregnant and Westward turns his back on her, she turns to her best friends bo, Jack for comfort.  She tricks him and makes him think the baby is his.  Eve, who was born to a poor family has only the gottage left to her by her parents to call her own.  The friends think of it as a stolen hideaway in the woods where they can go to escape the world.

378060,A2P49WD75WHAG5,6303501281,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[45, 48]","Set in post-World War II Ireland, namely the late 1940's and late 50's, Circle Of Friends tells of three girls, Eve, who was raised in a convent because her parents died, the stunning Nan Mahon, and the plain but pleasant and charming Benny Hogan, who's father is the local tailor.  She narrates the film from time to time, and Minnie Driver's charming voice aids in what's quite a charming little movie about being sure of and true to oneself despite changes.The three go to the college in Dublin, attend classes, and go back on the 10 past 6 bus to the village.  In an anthropology class, she learns of an obscure tribe and their culture, one of which is that men and women mingle freely without shame or guilt, a contrast to the repressive Catholic upbringing the girls have.  But this learning also parallels her meeting Jack Foley, a handsome blonde with blue eyes and a nice smile.  She's quite taken when he asks her out to a dance, only to be gradually disillusioned when he doesn't as time goes on.  When he finally does ask her, she tells him that she doesn't like being messed about, but further that despite being a rhinoceros, a reference to her perceived bigness, she has a thin skin.  She is heartened that he feels comfortable talking to her honestly.  He sees that she's all there, more grounded, sure of herself.  In contrast, Jack wants to play rugby but is going for the medical program because of his father's wishes and despite the fact that he faints at the sight of blood.  Through her interactions, she learns that she is capable of being loved and to love, but she never goes all the way.  Jack indeed is a preferable pick from the oily Sean Walsh, an employee of Mr. Hogan's shop who aspires to be a partner, but also wants to marry Benny.  It's further his dream to run the shop when Mr. Hogan retires.  However, Benny is quite turned off by Sean, much to her parents' disappointment.  This learning at school is making her self-aware, and she's made up her mind who she wants to marry, should she do so.  What's the point of learning all that knowledge, only to go back to her little village and be a good little wife, something also explored in the later Mona Lisa Smile.The divide between Protestants and Catholics is seen here in the form of Simon Westward, a member of the landowning family who wants to marry the right girl.  That is what Nan is looking for, a real man, seeing her peers as just boys, as tryouts.  Things don't go the way she plans, leading her to disrupt Benny and Jack.It's easy to see why Minnie Driver became a star.  As the shy, hopeful, intelligent, and sensitive Benny, she's a fresh face.  And she's unique with that slightly wide face of hers, She is mostly seen without much makeup, and she still looks wonderful, and with that accent and beaming countenance, totally believable as a daughter of the Emerald Isle.  I'd definitely go for someone like her.  Geraldine O'Rawe lends strong support as Eve, who turns out to be more loyal and true to Benny.  Chris O'Donnell also gets a thumbs up as Jack, a likeable enough person, less sure of himself, well-meaning, but with a few failings.As in all the other films I've seen him in, Alan Cumming (Sean) is another slimy, lizard-like, fawning toadie (Titus, Spiceworld, Eyes Wide Shut).  He is a bit pathetic with his greasy black hair and sickly smile, but he's a character to be reviled as time goes on.With a nice closing song, ""You're The One,"" sung by Maire Brennan and Shane McGowan, Circle Of Friends is a film that doesn't go for the predictable drama of most romance movies.

I think I'll keep it.  I'd forgotten how good a movie it is.  It's such a relief these days to see a film with so many reasonable, believable characters when so many movies now seem to sell themselves on outlandishness.It was HUGELY refreshing to see a girl who really is big--tall and solid--playing a character that's supposed to be big.  She is not at all unattractive and is not portrayed as plain, awkward, or ""nerdy"" (as un-beauties usually are).  She's just not a silver-screen sylph, and thankfully the movie doesn't punish her for it or make a lot of ugly-duckling jokes at her expense.  Hooray, Minnie Driver!Geraldine O'Rawe is also great, feisty but not heartless, sensible, and intelligent.  Saffron Burrows has less of a part but it's clear that she's naive and got in over her head, and not just a heartless vamp.  It's clear why the three girls are friends but the characters are not played so much alike that they seem flat.

Where, in the book, Eve's bitterness towards the Westward family (her own grandparents and uncle) is highly understandable, the film leaves one wondering why she would so resent people generous enough to pay her way through school entirely because her father was once their employee. Sean Walsh, who originally was shady and avaricious, is now a highly strange man who attempts to rape Benny - and, where Benny's innocent parents could easily be deceived by a swindler, their encouraging a daughter to become involved with one so obviously a problem seems sinister. Those who, in reading the book, enjoyed the thought of Benny's being elegantly clad in a brocade original will find her breasts popping out of an ill-fitting black dress to be far more pathetic than humorous.This film is suitable for an afternoon of no-thought relaxation, but, if the scenery is a feast, it is a famine in the literary department.",3,"Well, the scenery is beautiful...",997833600,"08 15, 2001",2001,1385,"['Maeve', 'Binchy', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'modern', 'day', 'Shakespeare', 'books', 'are', 'engaging', 'depiction', 'relationships', 'sorts', 'Where', 'novel', 'quot', 'Circle', 'Friends', 'quot', 'was', 'charming', 'somewhat', 'slow', 'exploration', 'friendship', 'love', 'film', 'one-joke', 'tiresome', 'bore', 'theme', 'plot', 'reduced', 'main', 'characters', 'will', 'lose', 'religious', 'convictions', 'enough', 'have', 'sex.Some', 'glaring', 'changes', 'novel', 'film', 'are', 'completely', 'puzzling', 'Where', 'book', 'Eve', 'bitterness', 'Westward', 'family', 'own', 'grandparents', 'uncle', 'highly', 'understandable', 'film', 'one', 'wondering', 'why', 'would', 'so', 'resent', 'people', 'generous', 'enough', 'pay', 'way', 'school', 'entirely', 'father', 'was', 'once', 'employee', 'Sean', 'Walsh', 'who', 'originally', 'was', 'shady', 'avaricious', 'now', 'highly', 'strange', 'man', 'who', 'rape', 'Benny', 'where', 'Benny', 'innocent', 'parents', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'deceived', 'swindler', 'encouraging', 'daughter', 'become', 'involved', 'one', 'so', 'obviously', 'problem', 'sinister', 'who', 'reading', 'book', 'enjoyed', 'thought', 'Benny', 'being', 'elegantly', 'clad', 'brocade', 'original', 'will', 'find', 'breasts', 'popping', 'ill-fitting', 'black', 'dress', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'pathetic', 'humorous.This', 'film', 'suitable', 'afternoon', 'no-thought', 'relaxation', 'scenery', 'feast', 'famine', 'literary', 'department']",Circle of Friends VHS

There, she encounters what we in the States would call a dreamboat, Jack (Chris O'Donnell). No way they could ever be anything but ""just friends"", right? Well, maybe not. Time to feel a little like two Joan Fontaine heroines, Jane Eyre and the Second Mrs. de Winter, when that good-looking guy may well be yours after all. While all this is taking place rather slowly, another of the friends, Nan, is in the fast lane with her rich Protestant boyfriend, played by Colin Firth. She's decided to act what she believes is sophisticated, with drastic results, ultimately tragically involving the other couple, Bennie and Jack.Evidently, one of the major characters from the book, Eve, got short shrift here in the movie. I for one couldn't understand why this apparently minor character popped up like a deus ex machina at the end, and was able to clear up the difficulty at hand.

378082,A1J2931UBBJPXM,6303501281,Reviewer,"[0, 1]","An endearing, Oscar worthy performance by Minnie Driver highlights ""Circle of Friends,"" a poignant story of friendship, love and loyalty, set in 1957 Ireland, directed by Pat O'Connor.  Driver stars as Bernadette ""Benny""  Hogan, a sensitive, somewhat self-conscious young lady (she sees herself as  plain and over-weight), about to enter the University of Dublin, along with  her two, life-long friends, Eve (Geraldine O'Rawe), and Nan (Saffron  Burrows).  At school she meets rugby star and med student Jack Foley (Chris  O'Donnell), and falls in love with him; and, once he gets to know her, (and  after a somewhat tenuous beginning), Jack realizes that he loves Benny, as  well.  Conflict intervenes upon their romance, however, and complications  ensue when circumstances force them into a prolonged separation.  Benny's  home is a bus ride away from Dublin, and it becomes necessary for her to  stay for awhile and help with the family store.  Ultimately, it leads to an  incident involving Jack and Nan, when Jack becomes unwittingly drawn into a  particularly sensitive and unpleasant situation which has recently arisen  between Nan and her wealthy suitor, Simon Westward (Colin Firth).  Driver is the real story here, though, as she gives an incredibly touching  performance that so adeptly conveys Benny's sensitivities; she is Benny  from the inside out, wearing her heart on her sleeve and so vulnerable to  the pain that life can seemingly inflict at will.  She is so winsome, and  accessible, that it enables you to share her joy and feel her pain; all due  to Driver's incredible ability to make such an absolute emotional  connection between her Benny and the audience.  And having the capacity to  evoke such empathy underscores what a truly gifted actress Driver is.  As  Jack, Chris O'Donnell gives one of his finest performances to date, as  well.  He manages to delve beneath the surface to tap Jack's  indecisiveness, his self-confidence tinged with doubt, while fleshing out  the moral aptitude which defines him,  and it's reassuring to know that  there's so much more to him than being the star jock of the rugby team,  because Benny deserves more than that.  The audience's identification with  Benny is so strong that her endeavors must be rewarded with a man worthy of  her affection; for Jack to be any less than he is would be unacceptable and  unsatisfying.  The wonderful supporting cast includes Alan Cumming  (Sean), Mick Lally (Dan Hogan), Ciaran Hinds (Professor Flynn), John  Kavanagh (Brian Mahon) and Britta Smith (Mrs. Hogan).  Superbly acted and  well directed, ""Circle of Friends"" is a captivating, memorable film,  visually attractive and complimented by an engaging soundtrack of lilting,  Irish melodies, and Benny is a young woman you'll take into your heart and  keep there; for she is unforgettable.

Driver is wonderful as an exceptional girl whose boyfriend has the brains to see beyond her plain appearance.  Few films transmit the joy of discovery of youth:  sex, of course, but also ideas that go beyond the confines of family and village.  It is a time of opening out, when you can choose who you want to be while you know you are losing something from childhood as well.  The film is pitch perfect for this.At the heart of the film are also terrible betrayals.  These things can cause such terrible pain when one is so young and open, so ready to embrace the new without seeing the dangers.  It is where the true person begins to emerge, in spite of mistakes but also deeper motives and capabilities.  We can grow beyond this early, and most of us must.

Parrish,"[5, 5]","This is very enjoyable film,well done,finely understated and well-played by all it's actors.Centering on Benny(Minnie Driver),a plain,unassuming girl growing up in Ireland in the fifties,the story begins when she goes off to college and becomes smitten with a handsome rugby player,played by Chris O'Donnell.Thier scenes together are wonderfully nuanced and insightful,and played with genuine feeling.The film can be a bit predictable,with familiar conflicts between Benny and her parents arising,and there's also an incongruously harsh sub-plot centered on a friend of Benny's played by Saffron Burrows,who gets pregnant,causing rather dire complications to ensue.It's better to focus on Minnie Driver,who simply sparkles in the lead role,although it always confuses me when a role calls for someone to be thought of as not particularly attractive,and then they hire an actress as drop-dead as Driver.Oh,well,that's movies for you.Suffice it to say that Minnie gives a great performance,tapping into Benny's defiant spirit,sharp intelligence,and boundless heart.It's a star-making performance,and a film to be proud of.",4,Beautiful Romance,984528000,"03 14, 2001",2001,1120,"['very', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'well', 'done', 'finely', 'understated', 'well-played', 'actors.Centering', 'Benny', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'plain', 'unassuming', 'girl', 'growing', 'up', 'Ireland', 'fifties', 'story', 'when', 'off', 'college', 'becomes', 'smitten', 'handsome', 'rugby', 'player', 'played', 'Chris', ""O'Donnell.Thier"", 'together', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'nuanced', 'insightful', 'played', 'genuine', 'feeling.The', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'predictable', 'familiar', 'conflicts', 'Benny', 'parents', 'arising', 'also', 'incongruously', 'harsh', 'sub-plot', 'centered', 'friend', 'Benny', 'played', 'Saffron', 'Burrows', 'who', 'pregnant', 'causing', 'rather', 'dire', 'complications', 'ensue.It', 'better', 'focus', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'who', 'simply', 'lead', 'role', 'always', 'when', 'role', 'someone', 'be', 'thought', 'not', 'particularly', 'attractive', 'then', 'hire', 'actress', 'as', 'drop-dead', 'Driver.Oh', 'well', 'movies', 'you.Suffice', 'say', 'Minnie', 'great', 'performance', 'tapping', 'Benny', 'defiant', 'spirit', 'sharp', 'intelligence', 'boundless', 'heart.It', 'star-making', 'performance', 'film', 'be', 'proud']",Circle of Friends VHS
