Steve Martin is absolutely incredible as an up-and-coming lawyer possessed by the spirit of his cranky, rich, dead client. The story may be silly and the characters over-the-top (especially the ""Tibetan swami""), but I found myself laughing at Martin's antics enough to keep me entertained from start to finish. Martin especially shines in scenes where he has to physically show that his body is under the command of two competing minds -- his left side walking and gesturing ""like a man"" and his right side walking and gesturing ""like a woman."" It's not a truly great film, but it makes wonderful B-movie Saturday matinee fare.My real complaint is that the DVD itself is downright lousy. It's a ""full-frame"" pan-and-scan DVD (where sides of the widescreen original image were chopped off to fully fill an older TV screen), and the image quality is only fair at best. The picture looks washed out and film dust and a handful of scratches remain. The sound is especially bad -- the dialogue sounds muffled and the overall volume is low so that I had to crank up my stereo's volume to hear everything (and got a nasty shock when the full-volume studio logo appeared at the end). The DVD presentation gives the film the look of a cheesy low-budget educational film of 15-20 years earlier. This film really deserves a better presentation. Since it's now out-of-print, it's probably best to wait until the studios can give it a proper DVD or Blu-ray release.",2,Best to wait for a new release,1267747200,"03 5, 2010",2010,1498,"['what', 'really', ""n't"", 'bad', 'film', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'absolutely', 'incredible', 'up-and-coming', 'lawyer', 'possessed', 'spirit', 'cranky', 'rich', 'dead', 'client', 'story', 'may', 'be', 'silly', 'characters', 'over-the-top', 'especially', 'Tibetan', 'swami', 'found', 'laughing', 'Martin', 'antics', 'enough', 'keep', 'entertained', 'start', 'finish', 'Martin', 'especially', 'scenes', 'where', 'physically', 'show', 'body', 'command', 'two', 'competing', 'minds', 'left', 'side', 'walking', 'gesturing', 'man', 'right', 'side', 'walking', 'gesturing', 'woman', 'not', 'truly', 'great', 'film', 'wonderful', 'B-movie', 'Saturday', 'matinee', 'real', 'complaint', 'DVD', 'downright', 'lousy', 'full-frame', 'pan-and-scan', 'DVD', 'where', 'sides', 'widescreen', 'original', 'image', 'were', 'chopped', 'off', 'fully', 'fill', 'older', 'TV', 'screen', 'image', 'quality', 'only', 'fair', 'best', 'picture', 'washed', 'out', 'film', 'dust', 'handful', 'scratches', 'remain', 'sound', 'especially', 'bad', 'dialogue', 'muffled', 'overall', 'volume', 'low', 'had', 'crank', 'up', 'stereo', 'volume', 'hear', 'everything', 'got', 'nasty', 'shock', 'when', 'full-volume', 'studio', 'logo', 'appeared', 'end', 'DVD', 'presentation', 'film', 'look', 'cheesy', 'low-budget', 'educational', 'film', '15-20', 'years', 'earlier', 'film', 'really', 'better', 'presentation', 'now', 'out-of-print', 'probably', 'best', 'wait', 'studios', 'can', 'give', 'proper', 'DVD', 'Blu-ray', 'release']",All of Me VHS

456547,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6305262160,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 1]","As his recently published memoir,Born Standing Up: A Comic's Life, reminds me, Steve Martin catapulted to mainstream mega-success by bringing zeitgeist freshness onto the comedy scene. When he first transitioned to the big screen, he had quite a productive partnership going with director and fellow comic actor Carl Reiner beginning with his yuk-fest film debut,The Jerk(1979), continuing with the noir film-clip-orientedDead Men Don't Wear Plaid(1982) and the sci-fi farceThe Man with Two Brains(1983), and then peaking with this 1984 farce, sadly their last collaboration. Captured in a surprisingly clean version on this 1999 DVD, this is still one of the funniest movies of the 1980's simply because its innately silly concept is executed with side-splitting freshness and a great amount of heart.Written by Phil Alden Robinson (who went on to write and direct the definitive fantasy-laden paean to lost fathers,Field of Dreams), the plot concerns Roger Cobb, an idealistic but unfulfilled lawyer who moonlights as a jazz guitarist. His sympathetic boss assigns him a case to handle the estate of sickly Edwina Cutwater, a wealthy eccentric who has decided to have Prahka Lasa, a daffy Tibetan meditation master, transfer her soul into the body of Terry Hoskins, the stableman's comely daughter. That way, Edwina can enjoy life anew in Terry's youthful body while Terry's soul becomes part of the universe. Roger understandably doesn't buy this, but before he can quit the case, he accidentally becomes the recipient of Edwina's soul upon her sudden death in his firm's office. The fun begins in earnest when Roger and Edwina both inhabit the two halves of Roger's body, a comically disastrous situation with their respective sensibilities at war. Needless to say, further complications ensue.As Roger, Martin shows that he was one of the most adroit physical actors around with his masterfully antic performance, especially when Edwina first enters Roger's body on the sidewalk and then in inevitably complex scenes involving the men's room and later a lovemaking session. As snooty but vulnerable Edwina, Lily Tomlin has less to do since her voiceover primarily dictates the scenes after the soul transference, but she is still a hilarious match for Martin when they battle for domination over Roger's bodily movements. In probably the most politically incorrect role since Mickey Rooney's Japanese neighbor inBreakfast at Tiffany's, Richard Libertini is downright hilarious as the swami as he seems to make up his own catchphrases on the spot (""Bakinbowl! Bakinbowl!""). Madolyn Smith has one funny scene as Roger's venal fianc&eacute;e Peggy, and I only wish she could have switched roles with Victoria Tennant, who as Terry, is the film's only marginal disappointment with her stiff manner too much at odds with the rest of the comically dexterous cast. The liberating dance under the closing credits is one of the best endings to any movie comedy. Unfortunately, other than the original theatrical trailer, there are no extras with the current DVD on the market.",5,Martin at His Physically Antic Peak in a Hilarious Screwball Fantasy Farce,1199664000,"01 7, 2008",2008,3072,"['recently', 'published', 'memoir', 'Born', 'Standing', 'Up', 'Comic', 'Life', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'catapulted', 'mainstream', 'mega-success', 'bringing', 'zeitgeist', 'freshness', 'comedy', 'scene', 'When', 'first', 'transitioned', 'big', 'screen', 'had', 'quite', 'productive', 'partnership', 'going', 'director', 'fellow', 'comic', 'actor', 'Carl', 'Reiner', 'beginning', 'yuk-fest', 'film', 'debut', 'Jerk', '1979', 'continuing', 'noir', 'film-clip-orientedDead', 'Men', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Wear', 'Plaid', '1982', 'sci-fi', 'farceThe', 'Man', 'Two', 'Brains', '1983', 'then', 'peaking', '1984', 'farce', 'sadly', 'last', 'collaboration', 'Captured', 'surprisingly', 'clean', 'version', '1999', 'DVD', 'still', 'one', 'funniest', 'movies', '1980', 'simply', 'innately', 'silly', 'concept', 'executed', 'side-splitting', 'freshness', 'great', 'amount', 'heart.Written', 'Phil', 'Alden', 'Robinson', 'who', 'went', 'write', 'direct', 'definitive', 'fantasy-laden', 'paean', 'lost', 'fathers', 'Field', 'Dreams', 'plot', 'concerns', 'Roger', 'Cobb', 'idealistic', 'unfulfilled', 'lawyer', 'who', 'jazz', 'guitarist', 'sympathetic', 'boss', 'case', 'handle', 'estate', 'sickly', 'Edwina', 'Cutwater', 'wealthy', 'eccentric', 'who', 'decided', 'have', 'Prahka', 'Lasa', 'daffy', 'Tibetan', 'meditation', 'master', 'transfer', 'soul', 'body', 'Terry', 'Hoskins', 'stableman', 'comely', 'daughter', 'way', 'Edwina', 'can', 'enjoy', 'life', 'anew', 'Terry', 'youthful', 'body', 'Terry', 'soul', 'part', 'universe', 'Roger', 'understandably', ""n't"", 'buy', 'can', 'quit', 'case', 'accidentally', 'recipient', 'Edwina', 'soul', 'sudden', 'death', 'firm', 'office', 'fun', 'earnest', 'when', 'Roger', 'Edwina', 'inhabit', 'two', 'halves', 'Roger', 'body', 'comically', 'disastrous', 'situation', 'respective', 'sensibilities', 'war', 'Needless', 'say', 'further', 'complications', 'ensue.As', 'Roger', 'Martin', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'adroit', 'physical', 'actors', 'masterfully', 'antic', 'performance', 'especially', 'when', 'Edwina', 'first', 'Roger', 'body', 'sidewalk', 'then', 'inevitably', 'complex', 'scenes', 'involving', 'men', 'room', 'later', 'lovemaking', 'session', 'snooty', 'vulnerable', 'Edwina', 'Lily', 'Tomlin', 'less', 'do', 'voiceover', 'primarily', 'scenes', 'soul', 'transference', 'still', 'hilarious', 'match', 'Martin', 'when', 'battle', 'domination', 'Roger', 'bodily', 'movements', 'probably', 'most', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'role', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'Japanese', 'neighbor', 'inBreakfast', 'Tiffany', 'Richard', 'Libertini', 'downright', 'hilarious', 'swami', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'catchphrases', 'spot', 'Bakinbowl', 'Bakinbowl', 'Madolyn', 'Smith', 'one', 'funny', 'scene', 'Roger', 'venal', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Peggy', 'only', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'switched', 'roles', 'Victoria', 'Tennant', 'who', 'Terry', 'film', 'only', 'marginal', 'disappointment', 'stiff', 'manner', 'too', 'much', 'odds', 'rest', 'comically', 'dexterous', 'cast', 'liberating', 'dance', 'closing', 'credits', 'one', 'best', 'endings', 'movie', 'comedy', 'Unfortunately', 'other', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'are', 'extras', 'current', 'DVD', 'market']",All of Me VHS

That's the situation plaguing Steve Martin in ""All of Me.""Martin played lawyer Roger Cobb, in perhaps one of his greatest early films. Lily Tomlin also dazzles as dying and quite uptight heiress/millionaire Edwina Cutwater. The way these two conversed at her house in the earliest scenes of the film, they were practically shooting daggers at each other. I was waiting for her to punch him. Well, maybe not, but they really went at each other. the truth is, all Edwina did was feel sorry for her self. But being trapped in Roger and seeing life from another perspective taught her that life is what you make of it, and that everyone needs to live a little.Though the beginning lacks any real interest, the film builds up to an interesting plot, and a very happy ending. However, I felt that some key parts were exceptionally well done. The parts I found exciting and funny are the scene where Roger struggles for control of his own body on the sidewalk, while screaming and flinging himself around. The bathroom scene, in which Edwina grabs his ""Mr Ed."" or ""Little Fireman"" too hard, sending him screaming around the bathroom in pain. Another is the attempted sex scenes. Why do I say attempted? Because the first one is performed when Edwina is sleeping, but she wakes up and Roger can't control himself anymore.The basic moral of the story is that we have to learn to live, and life isn't always how you want it to be.

Too often they rely on crass humor, quickly-dated pop culture gags, and actors whose comedic talents mostly consist of mugging endlessly to the camera and abusing their fellow actors.  It makes me miss the comedies of the past, which relied more on clever dialogue and talented actors with a great sense of comic timing.  Sure, those movies had their share of sexual humor, but they knew to balance it out with genuine slapstick and observational humor, and much of the humor came from characterization as well as plain goofiness.  Steve Martin and Lily Tomlin were both wonderful comedy actors, and knew how to work a comedic script to its greatest extent.""All Of Me"" is a great showcase of both actors' talents, balancing slapstick comedy with hilarious dialogue and characters.  It's a memorable romp that deserves more attention than it gets.Steve Martin plays Roger Cobb, a beleaguered lawyer who feels like little more than an errand boy to his senior partner and moonlights as a jazz musician after work.  When he's sent to finalize the will of dying heiress Edwina Cutwater, he immediately takes a dislike to her arrogance and is more than a little weirded out by her plans for her death -- to have a Hindu swami transfer her soul into the younger, healthy body of her stableman's daughter, cheat death, and get a second lease on life.  Things take a turn for the hilariously worse when, upon her death, the ceremony is botched and she ends up inhabiting one side of Roger's body.  As the two struggle to share a body and track down the swami to set things right again, Edwina will end up getting Roger into all sorts of hijinks involving his boss's divorce trial, his blind musician buddy, his fianc&eacute; (the boss's daughter), and the stableman's beautiful daughter... but it might also lead to an unusual friendship as well.They don't make comedies like this anymore.  The plot is zany but fun, the dialogue is wickedly funny, and there's real character development as the film progresses.  Both Roger and Edwina grow over the course of the film, and end up better, happier people despite (or maybe because of) the strange circumstances they find themselves in.  There's a diabolical plot woven into the film as well, of course, but it simply adds to the hijinks and even serves to provide some surprisingly tender moments.Martin and Tomlin shine as the stars of this show, their comedic talents matching up well as the two characters butt heads.  Martin has a gift for both clever, acerbic one-liners and physical comedy, and Tomlin's snarkiness compliments his talents.  The other actors provide some great moments as well, but for the most part play ""straight man"" to the comedic duo (though the swami gets some hilarious moments as the fish-out-of-water mystic).The DVD transfer is passable, but not great, making the film look like it was taken straight from the VHS tape rather than remastered at all.  For this, it gets one star docked.  Hopefully they release a remastered edition someday, maybe with a few extra features.A great '80s comedy that doesn't get the attention it deserves.  If you're a Steve Martin or Lily Tomlin fan, give this one a shot.

456582,A3NM1MT3Q2FHXV,6305262160,S.E. Poza,"[4, 6]","I don't know how receptive the studios were when this story was pitched but the entire concept must have been a hard sell as well as a hard one to write. Through a series of unfortunate incidents, a rich heiress dies and finds her spirit stuck in the body of a lawyer she recently dismissed. The story largely revolves around how the heiress (Tomlin) and the lawyer (Martin) cope with sharing a body (he gets the left half, she gets the right half) and dealing with their disparate personalities.Since Tomlin is ""trapped"" inside Martin, the writers and flimmakers had to come up with a means by which the two characters could face each other and offer a feeling that the heiress's presence could be sensed by the audience at all times even when only Martin was on camera. This was brilliantly and deftly done to comedic and sympathetic effect. The characters are not only funny but you feel for them.In my opinion, this is Steve Martin's finest work (followed by the greatly underrated Bowfinger). He's good when he's dumb but he's great when he's cleverly quipping and being sarcastic (something he doesn't get to do much of anymore in his movies, unfortunately). His physical comedy is so tremendously good that he never makes the viewer doubt for a second that there is someone else in there with him. And, unlike much physical comedy in movies, it doesn't feel contrived or like a pratfall.Tomlin is also very good as Edwina, the heiress, but she didn't have as demanding a role as Martin. She does succeed very well in making us empathize with someone who initially seems wholly unappealing and has quite a few good, funny lines of her own. There is a courtroom scene where Edwina has to ad lib while Roger (Martin) is asleep which is particularly nice voice work by Tomlin.The only thing about this movie that I didn't buy 100% was the romantic chemistry between Tomlin and Martin. I believe there was genuine affection between the actors but their rapport strikes one as more fraternal than romantic. Still, it's a minor issue and perhaps only my subjective take.Good comedy is hard to come by these days so we should take advantage of the rich library of movies from the recent past and I'm pleased this movie has been released on DVD. I can't imagine anyone not laughing out loud plenty while watching ""All of Me.""",5,A difficult concept beautifully executed,1118448000,"06 11, 2005",2005,2323,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'receptive', 'studios', 'were', 'when', 'story', 'was', 'pitched', 'entire', 'concept', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'hard', 'sell', 'as', 'well', 'hard', 'one', 'write', 'series', 'unfortunate', 'incidents', 'rich', 'heiress', 'dies', 'spirit', 'stuck', 'body', 'lawyer', 'recently', 'dismissed', 'story', 'largely', 'how', 'heiress', 'Tomlin', 'lawyer', 'Martin', 'cope', 'sharing', 'body', 'left', 'half', 'right', 'half', 'dealing', 'disparate', 'personalities.Since', 'Tomlin', 'trapped', 'Martin', 'writers', 'flimmakers', 'had', 'come', 'up', 'means', 'two', 'characters', 'could', 'face', 'other', 'offer', 'feeling', 'heiress', 'presence', 'could', 'be', 'sensed', 'audience', 'times', 'even', 'when', 'only', 'Martin', 'was', 'camera', 'was', 'brilliantly', 'deftly', 'done', 'comedic', 'sympathetic', 'effect', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'funny', 'feel', 'them.In', 'opinion', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'finest', 'work', 'followed', 'greatly', 'underrated', 'Bowfinger', 'good', 'when', 'dumb', 'great', 'when', 'cleverly', 'quipping', 'being', 'sarcastic', 'something', ""n't"", 'get', 'do', 'much', 'anymore', 'movies', 'unfortunately', 'physical', 'comedy', 'so', 'tremendously', 'good', 'never', 'viewer', 'doubt', 'second', 'someone', 'else', 'much', 'physical', 'comedy', 'movies', ""n't"", 'feel', 'contrived', 'pratfall.Tomlin', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'Edwina', 'heiress', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'demanding', 'role', 'Martin', 'succeed', 'very', 'well', 'making', 'empathize', 'someone', 'who', 'initially', 'wholly', 'unappealing', 'quite', 'few', 'good', 'funny', 'lines', 'own', 'courtroom', 'scene', 'where', 'Edwina', 'ad', 'lib', 'Roger', 'Martin', 'asleep', 'particularly', 'nice', 'voice', 'work', 'Tomlin.The', 'only', 'thing', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', '100', '%', 'was', 'romantic', 'chemistry', 'Tomlin', 'Martin', 'believe', 'was', 'genuine', 'affection', 'actors', 'rapport', 'one', 'more', 'fraternal', 'romantic', 'Still', 'minor', 'issue', 'perhaps', 'only', 'subjective', 'take.Good', 'comedy', 'hard', 'come', 'days', 'should', 'take', 'advantage', 'rich', 'library', 'movies', 'recent', 'past', ""'m"", 'pleased', 'movie', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anyone', 'not', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'plenty', 'watching', 'Me']",All of Me VHS

Tomlin plays Edwina Cutwater, spoiled rich brat of fragile health.  Steve Martin is Roger Cobb, hapless lawyer of working class origins who'd really rather be a jazzman.  Selma Diamond (""Night Court"") is just right as Cobb's law secretary in a part that feels like it was written for her.  Richard Libertini is over the top as Prahka, eastern swami, in a part that also feels like it must have been written for him.  And then there's Victoria Tennant as Terri Hoskins, beautiful daughter of Cutwater's stable man.After a lifetime of threatening to die any minute, Cutwater is actually dying.  She makes arrangements with Prahka so as to transfer her soul into Terri Hoskins's tidy body.  Then the heiress requires Cobb, as he protests all the way, to write the unusual will leaving everything to Hoskins.  The heiress dies, Prahka trips, and her soul goes into Cobb's body, where it controls his right side.Many people speak of Martin's gift for physical comedy, and praise his three inspired scenes early in the picture.  First on the street, struggling to walk to his office building, then, somewhat later, his efforts to relieve himself, and to make love to Hoskins, all with Cutwater supposedly controlling half his body.  Hilarious these three scenes are, as is his split personality courtroom scene.  But they can't compete with the touching last scene, as Martin and Tomlin, their characters freed at last, do a wild and crazy jitterbug to ""All of Me.""

456587,A1DZSBTVCJ883,6305262160,W. Walker,"[0, 2]","The theme of this comedy is basically similar to that in the escapist car chase comedy ""Thelma and Louise"". We have  a single women this time, instead of a duo, who has missed out on nearly all the fun things in life, despite being rich in money. Thus, she hires a transcendentalist, while she lays dying, to transfer her soul into the body of a young healthy beautiful woman who hopefully will experience many of the joys she missed. Unfortunately, the soul transfer process goes wrong and she ends up dominating one side of Steve Martin's brain. You can imagine the comedic potential of this situation.In the case of ""Thelma and Louise"", we have a potentially much more realistic situation, with the bored women getting their kicks over a few days before disappearing over a cliff. In the present film, the comedic potential is greater, with Lily Tomlin's character having fun making Martin's character look like a fool, then finally making amends as she is transferred to the body of his girlfriend.(Apparently, her soul can  dominate only half a man's brain, but all of a women's brain). Actually, the film could have been a lot funnier if she had been transferred to the bodies of several more men, including Martin's law firm boss. The first part of the film could have been largely dispensed with, as things didn't get interesting until after the soul transfer process.
