546590,AM18CU72YEWH5,B00003RQPE,A. J Terry,"[1, 3]","Unlike most war movies and series, ""We'll Meet Again"" focuses almost entirely on romance. World War 2 merely provides a perfect way for lots of American enlisted men and officers to meet British girls (when on leave from an airbase near the small, conservative town of Market Wetherby). The war also provides the engines that drive all the romances that take place in this soap opera. A young soldier gets a young girl (whose father is the British equivalent of Archie Bunker) pregnant. A nice young soldier marries a nice girl, then the day after his wedding bails out of a plane that's been shot down over Germany--to add to the suspense, the pilot who saw him bail couldn't see whether his parachute opened or not. Two young soldiers habitually vie for the attentions of a flirtatious young barmaid who plays them against each other. The middle-aged officers are also in the swing of things. One becomes a substitute husband and father to a family where the husband has been reported missing in action. And--the most important storyline--Major Kylie has an agonized romance with local Doctor Dereham, whose husband is a non-fatal war casualty. Whenever a romance needs a roadblock, the guy gets wounded, killed, or goes missing.The acting is so-so, with the particular flaw that there is absolutely no chemistry between Michael Shannon, who plays Major Kylie and whose acting consists mostly of a tight-lipped smile, and Susannah York, who plays Doctor Dereham. The air scenes, such as they are, are blurry and not very convincing, merely consisting of a pilot (always the same actor) sitting in his seat, takeoffs, landings, and planes in V formation. There is one air scene that I am positive was used for two episodes (dialog and all), and others that at least looked very similar. The dialog runs from somewhat to totally cliched. I almost didn't make it through the first three episodes, where it's so cliched it's almost funny. The storylines tend to be predictable.The costumes are good (although they run to the luxurious for the war years). There is one set piece, a swing dance where one couple, who do not otherwise appear in the storyline, does a long solo containing almost every dip, flip, and acrobatic I've ever seen. The variety of accents (which occasionally waver) brings home the fact that the war threw together men from many different backgrounds.But by and large, this series is a guilty pleasure--I finished it because I'd started it. BBC doesn't seem to have felt the same way, as they ended it with a cliffhanger (everybody taking off for a huge air raid over Berlin), but never filmed a second season.",3,This is a chick flick/soap opera,1283817600,"09 7, 2010",2010,2631,"['most', 'war', 'movies', 'series', ""'ll"", 'Meet', 'Again', 'almost', 'entirely', 'romance', 'World', 'War', '2', 'merely', 'perfect', 'way', 'lots', 'American', 'enlisted', 'men', 'officers', 'meet', 'British', 'girls', 'when', 'leave', 'airbase', 'small', 'conservative', 'town', 'Market', 'Wetherby', 'war', 'also', 'engines', 'drive', 'romances', 'take', 'place', 'soap', 'opera', 'young', 'soldier', 'young', 'girl', 'father', 'British', 'equivalent', 'Archie', 'Bunker', 'pregnant', 'nice', 'young', 'soldier', 'marries', 'nice', 'girl', 'then', 'day', 'wedding', 'plane', 'been', 'shot', 'down', 'Germany', 'add', 'suspense', 'pilot', 'who', 'saw', 'bail', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'parachute', 'opened', 'not', 'Two', 'young', 'soldiers', 'habitually', 'vie', 'attentions', 'flirtatious', 'young', 'barmaid', 'who', 'other', 'middle-aged', 'officers', 'are', 'also', 'swing', 'things', 'One', 'substitute', 'husband', 'father', 'family', 'where', 'husband', 'been', 'reported', 'missing', 'action', 'most', 'important', 'storyline', 'Major', 'Kylie', 'agonized', 'romance', 'local', 'Doctor', 'Dereham', 'husband', 'non-fatal', 'war', 'casualty', 'Whenever', 'romance', 'roadblock', 'guy', 'wounded', 'killed', 'missing.The', 'acting', 'so-so', 'particular', 'flaw', 'absolutely', 'chemistry', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'who', 'Major', 'Kylie', 'acting', 'mostly', 'tight-lipped', 'smile', 'Susannah', 'York', 'who', 'Doctor', 'Dereham', 'air', 'scenes', 'such', 'are', 'are', 'blurry', 'not', 'very', 'convincing', 'merely', 'consisting', 'pilot', 'always', 'same', 'actor', 'sitting', 'seat', 'takeoffs', 'landings', 'planes', 'V', 'formation', 'one', 'air', 'scene', 'am', 'positive', 'was', 'used', 'two', 'episodes', 'dialog', 'others', 'least', 'looked', 'very', 'similar', 'dialog', 'somewhat', 'totally', 'cliched', 'almost', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'first', 'three', 'episodes', 'where', 'so', 'cliched', 'almost', 'funny', 'storylines', 'tend', 'be', 'predictable.The', 'costumes', 'are', 'good', 'run', 'luxurious', 'war', 'years', 'one', 'set', 'piece', 'swing', 'dance', 'where', 'one', 'couple', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'otherwise', 'appear', 'storyline', 'long', 'solo', 'containing', 'almost', 'dip', 'flip', 'acrobatic', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'variety', 'accents', 'occasionally', 'waver', 'home', 'fact', 'war', 'threw', 'together', 'men', 'many', 'different', 'backgrounds.But', 'large', 'series', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'finished', ""'d"", 'started', 'BBC', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'felt', 'same', 'way', 'ended', 'cliffhanger', 'everybody', 'taking', 'off', 'huge', 'air', 'raid', 'Berlin', 'never', 'filmed', 'second', 'season']",N/A

This was worse than American daytime TV soap operas!  The acting is appalling and stilted, which is a shame because there are some decent actors in the show.

The last show should have tied up all the loose ends but instead leaves viewers hanging by a very thin thread--perhaps they made a sequel I'm not aware of.

546595,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B00003RQPE,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[23, 23]","Compelling war drama about a USA Air Base in England. Struggling B-17 crews find solace among British ladies. The Yank's money is appreciated but not always their ways with alcohol and women. This is a story of the small village of Market Wetherby and it's war-weary locals, and how they cope with the new arrivals, American bomber soldiers who freshly join the war, and expect to win overnight.The British TV has always been excellent in period television series, war dramatizations, and this is no exception. War nostalgia. It is surpurb, with added interest of half a cast of Americans joining British actors. Brits have the preserved buildings to pull off a period series. They use that to advantage. Beautiful 1943 scenery, costumes, props. This show was actually filmed in the 80s but because of the historical setting, it is a timeless DVD set; classic. Perfect for those with war interest, awesome for those interested in what it was like living in a country waiting to be invaded by Hitler's army. It is something of a cousin series to the more recent homeland war drama of ""Foyles War"" (a must for all British Drama fans) and ""Enemy at the Door"" (also good).WE'LL MEET AGAIN cleverly mixes in actual bomber air strip and bombing raid footage. But much of the action takes place in the village homes and the local pub. Dr. Helen Dereham (by Susannah York) and Maj. Jim Kiley (Michael Shannon) are only two that show the extraordinary work that war leaders had to complete, as well as the struggles romantically of working so closely in life/death living. There's is not the only romance. Plenty of hardship and lives lost. Very believable, although I'm too young to know first-hand, being a Baby Boomer.The series ends well; but with a potential for another season, which, alas, never came. This set has no subtitles or CC. It's box warning of partial nudity refers to one breast exposed for 3 seconds.My wife and I both enjoyed this, both sorry there were no additional episodes after the 13 provided in this set.Episode details (each about 53 min.):1 ALL DAY AND EVERY DAY-Market Wetherby, Suffolk, April 1943.

546596,A1MJMBU9ZKYMXF,B00003RQPE,Ian K. Cartwright,"[4, 4]","This is a truly wonderful series about the arrival of the Americans in a small Suffolk village in England during World War 2 and the resulting effect this had on the lives of the community. Needless to say various relationships develop between the Americans and some of the local girls and the series is both filled with sadness and joy, laughter and tears, dreams and aspirations.The acting and character portrayal is second to none to the extent that by the time the series finishes you really feel that you have come to know the characters personally and have shared in their lives and experiences.As another reviewer mentioned, the Hymie and Elmer characters were a delight, because, despite their constant bickering, which will have you in stiches, you knew that, underneath it all, they were the great buddies.There was the beautiful and moving relationship, and eventual marriage of Chuck and Vi, coupled with the realism of the dangers that the aircrew faced on their various missions (interspersed with actual archive footage of the B 17's) - the sadness when some of them did not return, and the problematic developing relationship between Dr. Helen Dereham and Major James Kiley, so movingly portrayed by Susannah York and Michael J.Shannon, which will have you yearning for it to succeed despite concern for her husband.The series ends, perhaps strangely, not with the end of the War, but when the Allies are mounting their supreme offensive on Berlin, which promised hope for the future and the freedom to come. Whether this was deliberate, with a view to a possible second series I dont know, but in a way this was a nice touch in that it was difficult to predict the outcome for some of the relationships, particularly the forementioned Susannah York/Michael J. Shannon characters.A lot of modern drama concentrates on ""over the top"" (and therefore unreal) dialogue and too much emphasis on special effects. This series does not do this - which results in totally believable characters and storyline, where things dont always go as planned.Although made some 25 years ago it is still surprisingly fresh.A truly masterful series, and because it was a series involving both the Americans and their British Allies it should appeal to viewers on ""both sides of the pond"".I loved it.

No part of it had nudity, at least none I saw, however, the context was of adultry and love which is not founded on basic principles most would consider to be proper. However, this movie series gives an insight into how it probably was for so many service men going overseas, and also, for the women left behind, or for the women in the towns where the service men came during the second world war. It could cause heat felt thoughts for any who experienced some of what this movie showed.

546598,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B00003RQPE,Joseph Haschka,"[10, 16]","WE'LL MEET AGAIN is a thirteen-episode TV miniseries that aired in the UK in 1982.  Basically, it's a soap opera built around the presence of the U.S. Eighth Air Force's 525 Bomb Group in the small English village of Market Wetherby beginning in 1943. You know those Yanks - over paid, over sexed, and over here.I must admit right off that I only lasted into the first third of the second episode. My wife bailed out even sooner. It could be argued that I didn't give the production a fair shake. However, since it only lasted 3 months on the British telly, perhaps I'm prescient.The first thing that struck me was the poor video quality. The pastel colors indicated to me the DVD is a faithful copy of a faded film. And the occasional interjection of faded color file footage of B-17 bombers obviously filmed during the war years only adds to the unevenness of the entire affair. Perhaps the director was trying to match the video quality of the new to the old. For close-ups, the creators of the series apparently dragged one old B-17 out of some air museum to lend a thin patina of realism to the project.My wife's main observation was that the actors playing the Yanks didn't look like Americans. I agree, but can't quite myself put my finger on the reason. Perhaps they look too much like British soap stars doing albeit credible American accents. To me, the hair styles seemed wrong, and the age of the air crew members too old. After all, these were ostensibly boys barely out of high school.The only actor of note is Susannah York as Dr. Helen Dereham, a local physician. I last saw Ms. York as Thomas More's daughter in the most excellent MAN FOR ALL SEASONS (1966), and I was gratified to hear that she still has her sexily husky voice.WE&quot;LL MEET AGAIN isn't a comedy, or at least that small part that I saw wasn't. And, as a dramatic piece, it was absolutely flat. While it's not an overtly bad production, I saw nothing in 90 minutes to recommend it. As an alternative, rent the 1949 Gregory Peck film TWELVE O'CLOCK HIGH, or the more recent DARK BLUE WORLD (2001), for a more interesting depiction of Allies flying from England against Hitler's Fortress Europe.",2,Yanks don't have the monopoly on meritless soaps,1062806400,"09 6, 2003",2003,2179,"['WE', 'MEET', 'AGAIN', 'thirteen-episode', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'aired', 'UK', '1982', 'Basically', 'soap', 'opera', 'built', 'presence', 'U.S.', 'Eighth', 'Air', 'Force', '525', 'Bomb', 'Group', 'small', 'English', 'village', 'Market', 'Wetherby', 'beginning', '1943', 'know', 'Yanks', 'paid', 'sexed', 'here.I', 'must', 'admit', 'right', 'only', 'lasted', 'first', 'third', 'second', 'episode', 'wife', 'bailed', 'out', 'even', 'sooner', 'could', 'be', 'argued', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'production', 'fair', 'shake', 'However', 'only', 'lasted', '3', 'months', 'British', 'telly', 'perhaps', ""'m"", 'prescient.The', 'first', 'thing', 'struck', 'was', 'poor', 'video', 'quality', 'pastel', 'colors', 'indicated', 'DVD', 'faithful', 'copy', 'faded', 'film', 'occasional', 'interjection', 'faded', 'color', 'file', 'footage', 'B-17', 'bombers', 'obviously', 'filmed', 'war', 'years', 'only', 'unevenness', 'entire', 'affair', 'Perhaps', 'director', 'was', 'trying', 'match', 'video', 'quality', 'new', 'old', 'close-ups', 'creators', 'series', 'apparently', 'dragged', 'one', 'old', 'B-17', 'air', 'museum', 'lend', 'thin', 'patina', 'realism', 'project.My', 'wife', 'main', 'observation', 'was', 'actors', 'playing', 'Yanks', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'Americans', 'agree', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'put', 'finger', 'reason', 'Perhaps', 'look', 'too', 'much', 'British', 'soap', 'stars', 'doing', 'albeit', 'credible', 'American', 'accents', 'hair', 'styles', 'seemed', 'wrong', 'age', 'air', 'crew', 'members', 'too', 'old', 'were', 'ostensibly', 'boys', 'barely', 'high', 'school.The', 'only', 'actor', 'note', 'Susannah', 'York', 'Dr.', 'Helen', 'Dereham', 'local', 'physician', 'last', 'saw', 'Ms.', 'York', 'Thomas', 'More', 'daughter', 'most', 'excellent', 'MAN', 'FOR', 'ALL', 'SEASONS', '1966', 'was', 'gratified', 'hear', 'still', 'sexily', 'husky', 'voice.WE', 'quot', 'LL', 'MEET', 'AGAIN', ""n't"", 'comedy', 'least', 'small', 'part', 'saw', 'was', ""n't"", 'dramatic', 'piece', 'was', 'absolutely', 'flat', 'not', 'overtly', 'bad', 'production', 'saw', 'nothing', '90', 'minutes', 'recommend', 'alternative', 'rent', '1949', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'film', 'TWELVE', ""O'CLOCK"", 'HIGH', 'more', 'recent', 'DARK', 'BLUE', 'WORLD', '2001', 'more', 'interesting', 'depiction', 'Allies', 'flying', 'England', 'Hitler', 'Fortress', 'Europe']",N/A

If you've ever visited one of the decommissioned B-17 air bases in England, you can still feel the emotional residue of all those young lives risked -- and lost -- during the war.  While some of the characters are stereotypes (the brash New Yorker, the bigoted shopkeeper, the bashful harmonica player, the flirtatious teenage girl), many of them are spot on.  I strongly disagree with the reviewer who said there was no chemistry between Michael Shannon and Susannah York, the mature lovers at the center of the story.  When Major Kiley looked at Dr. Dereham, especially in the scene on the beach, my DVD melted.

The ""Yanks"" and villagers quickly take to butting heads over various issues, but not all the relationships formed are those of conflict - local doctor Helen Dereham (played by Oscar nominee Susannah York) and base commander Major James Kylie (played by Michael J.
