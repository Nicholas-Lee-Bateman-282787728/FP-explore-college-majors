1461710,A3M1EKSN23SVOJ,B005I4HNTY,"DICK YORK IS THE BETTER DICK ""Sterculeus Erectus""","[2, 2]","The last known CROSBY-NASH VIDEO..is the BBC IN CONCERT show from 1970 and that is not ""officially"" availble on DVD (it is all over you tube minus one song (Right Between The Eyes). So it has taken over 40 years for an offical long form  CROSBY-NASH concert. The set list is varied from old to new and contains some very nice song choices. Sure, a few more older or rarer Crosby rarities such as ""Somehow She Knew""  or""Triad"" (I can WISH)would have enhanced the set list greatly but what they DO perform still has crisp and beatiful harmony. Yes, Crosby's voice is in a lower range and Nash has to compensate but overall this is a very entertaining and fortunately COMPLETE show of this Satellite broadcast concert (Not a very easy broadcast to find on the net -I tried to watch it..and was shut out.) One negative...the BONUS footage is scarce and for some reason they do not include the rare (and only aired twice on Showtime) promo of Graham Nash performing ""Live On"" (the Wall) a very nice live performance video that has never surfaced on youtube or on this or any other DVD.",4,FINALLY A CROSBY-NASH DVD,1319760000,"10 28, 2011",2011,1080,"['last', 'known', 'CROSBY-NASH', 'VIDEO..is', 'BBC', 'IN', 'CONCERT', 'show', '1970', 'not', 'officially', 'availble', 'DVD', 'tube', 'one', 'song', 'Right', 'Between', 'Eyes', 'taken', 'over', '40', 'years', 'offical', 'long', 'form', 'CROSBY-NASH', 'concert', 'set', 'list', 'varied', 'old', 'new', 'very', 'nice', 'song', 'choices', 'Sure', 'few', 'more', 'older', 'rarer', 'Crosby', 'rarities', 'such', 'Somehow', 'Knew', 'Triad', 'can', 'WISH', 'would', 'have', 'enhanced', 'set', 'list', 'greatly', 'what', 'DO', 'perform', 'still', 'crisp', 'beatiful', 'harmony', 'Yes', 'Crosby', 'voice', 'lower', 'range', 'Nash', 'compensate', 'overall', 'very', 'entertaining', 'fortunately', 'COMPLETE', 'show', 'Satellite', 'broadcast', 'concert', 'Not', 'very', 'easy', 'broadcast', 'find', 'net', '-I', 'tried', 'watch', 'it..and', 'was', 'shut', 'out', 'One', 'negative', 'BONUS', 'footage', 'scarce', 'reason', 'do', 'not', 'include', 'rare', 'only', 'aired', 'twice', 'Showtime', 'promo', 'Graham', 'Nash', 'performing', 'Live', 'Wall', 'very', 'nice', 'live', 'performance', 'video', 'never', 'surfaced', 'youtube', 'other', 'DVD']",Crosby-Nash: In Concert
1461711,A101BX7DD7EUZ1,B005I4HNTY,firefly52,"[0, 0]","I have been waiting about 40 years to watch Graham Nash perform ""I used to be a king"". What a marvelous version on this DVD. The DVD is worth $20 to know the answer to...what language is the sign in saying ""don't dig here"" over Yucca mountain (nuclear disposal site). David Crosby's son co wrote the song and played keyboards for the concert. They hire session guitarist Dean Parks (Steely Dan and many other hit groups guitarist), Jackson Browne Bassist Kevin McCormick and Stevie D for drums. I have a half dozen DVDs of CSNY and in them Young falls asleep a couple times, Stills forgets the words on one and some are just not that pretty at all (Zevon quote). This is just darn near perfect. A few high notes could have been better but compared to most grey haired rock stars of my era they still really have it. Marrakesh Express was different but amazing, the horseplay between Nash and Crosby made it seem like you were right there with them. It was 2 1/2 hours of pure magic. Note a small part of the concert (1 hour) was on HD net but it basically cut the heart out of it. Cathedral has been one of my favorite CSNY songs and this version was as good as I have ever heard. The guitar solos on Wooden Ships, 8 miles high, I almost cut my hair, were also noteworthy. Only 1 bad song and it was a 1 minute political joke aimed at billion dollar corporations who paid no taxes (subliminal man...cough ""GE, etc""). It was truly a pleasure to the ears...shu",5,Better than ever,1371081600,"06 13, 2013",2013,1458,"['have', 'been', 'waiting', '40', 'years', 'watch', 'Graham', 'Nash', 'used', 'be', 'king', 'What', 'marvelous', 'version', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'worth', '20', 'know', 'answer', 'what', 'language', 'sign', 'saying', 'do', ""n't"", 'dig', 'here', 'Yucca', 'mountain', 'nuclear', 'disposal', 'site', 'David', 'Crosby', 'son', 'co', 'wrote', 'song', 'played', 'keyboards', 'concert', 'hire', 'session', 'guitarist', 'Dean', 'Parks', 'Steely', 'Dan', 'many', 'other', 'hit', 'groups', 'guitarist', 'Jackson', 'Browne', 'Bassist', 'Kevin', 'McCormick', 'Stevie', 'D', 'drums', 'have', 'half', 'dozen', 'DVDs', 'CSNY', 'Young', 'asleep', 'couple', 'times', 'Stills', 'words', 'one', 'are', 'just', 'not', 'pretty', 'Zevon', 'quote', 'just', 'darn', 'perfect', 'few', 'high', 'notes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'compared', 'most', 'grey', 'haired', 'rock', 'stars', 'era', 'still', 'really', 'have', 'Marrakesh', 'Express', 'was', 'different', 'amazing', 'horseplay', 'Nash', 'Crosby', 'made', 'seem', 'were', 'right', 'there', 'was', '2', '1/2', 'hours', 'pure', 'magic', 'Note', 'small', 'part', 'concert', '1', 'hour', 'was', 'HD', 'net', 'basically', 'cut', 'heart', 'Cathedral', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'CSNY', 'songs', 'version', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'guitar', 'solos', 'Wooden', 'Ships', '8', 'miles', 'high', 'almost', 'cut', 'hair', 'were', 'also', 'noteworthy', 'Only', '1', 'bad', 'song', 'was', '1', 'minute', 'political', 'joke', 'aimed', 'billion', 'dollar', 'corporations', 'who', 'paid', 'taxes', 'subliminal', 'man', 'GE', 'etc', 'was', 'truly', 'pleasure', 'ears', 'shu']",Crosby-Nash: In Concert

After seeing them so many times in the last decade there are really no surprises here for me: great sound, songs and chemistry.  Special mention must be made of David's supremely talented son, James Raymond on keyboards and vocals.  Check out the 2005 Crosby-Nash studio double cd set.

The acoustics in the concert venue are great and they both obviously enjoy themselves.  I got a real kick out of watch Graham when he was not singing.
