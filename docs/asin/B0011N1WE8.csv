Instead, the storyline aimed for a more serious direction involving a girl with a snout on her face.I realize this is just a make believe storyline, but I found it quite weird whenever someone immediately noticed the snout on the girls face they'd immediately either take off running, jump out a window, etc.  Her snout honestly wasn't THAT bad.  In fact, you might even say it's kind of cute.The writers probably should have gone the extra mile to make the snout bigger and grosser to REALLY intensify the girls shocking appearance.Anyway, the storytelling is about the girls parents trying to keep her hidden in the house for the rest of her life so nobody from the outside world will make fun of her appearance.  Unfortunately, the girl continues having urges to meet guys and fall in love, so she eventually has to find the courage to leave home and see what the outside world is like.The first 20 minutes of storytelling are really bland and well, to be honest, completely terrible.  It talks about a family curse, but it's so far-fetched and quite unrelated to what the actual storyline is about, that it leaves me completely cold.Not enough potential to tell a more interesting story.  That's my overall impression of it.The movie is definitely *very* short on actual laughs.

Penelope is the first born female in a long line of males in her family. Penelope has lived with the curse for almost 20 years and lived a sheltered existence behind the walls of her family mansion. Her family did this to keep her away from the press and from the whole world finding out about her. Her parents lied to the media that Penelope died in her infancy.Anyway now 20 years later in order for Penelope to 'break the curse' and have a normal face she must MARRY another human. Unfortunately all the people who their parents try to find run away and some even crazily jump through the window when they see Penelope snouted face (which makes me feel very bad for her)!

As it is an obvious plot - fairly predictable - I won't go into too much detail about the story.  It's not an ugly duckling story as some reviewers have said but more like a reversed Beauty and the Beast.  There's a curse put upon a family and because of this curse, Penelope, our heroine, is born with a snout and the only way to break the curse is for her to find someone to marry her.  And thus begins her family's journey to find the right man for this cursed girl.  Unlike the story of the Beauty and the Beast this fairy tale has a sophisticated twist to it - which was fantastic.  Although, the story is absolutely fantastic, I have to say I was more charmed by the visual of the movie.  Oh, how beautifully this story was presented.  The production team created this whole world that doesn't quite fit in any time  period - a victorian gothic married with the twenty-first century... all the colours and the quirky and quaint setting were a sight to behold.  I'd want to live on that set if it was real!  :DThere were no weak links in the whole cast.  Christina Ricci played Penelope beautifully.  She is supposedly the female beast but her beauty shines through remarkably - and sometimes, she was too beautiful to be the 'beast' of the movie, even with the snout!  ;)  A special mention goes out to Mr Bennet.  It was hilarius to see the hunk from Pride and Prejudice become a daft prick!I would like to warn you, though, not to expect a romantic comedy.  The story revolves around the character Penelope and how she overcomes and braves the hurdles of life.  The movie stands to send out a message.  There is a romantic story to it but it's definitely not the central plot.

This isn't to say that the film is bad or even that it doesn't work; in all honesty, I thoroughly enjoyed it. ""Penelope"" is a delightful, charming little fantasy, full of humor and heart with just a touch of magic to top everything off. I mean that as more than just a corny phrase for a movie review--the general look of the film has a slight surrealistic edge, so slight that at times it's hard to pick up on. But it's there, believe me. It's most noticeable in the design, color, condition, and population of the city, a place never directly named but somewhat reminiscent of London. A somewhat unrealistic location requires a somewhat unrealistic character; we find this in Penelope Wilhern (Christina Ricci), a sweet and charming young girl from a rich family who's having a lot of trouble finding a husband.There's a very good reason for this. Apparently, her great grandfather--a blue-blooded man of wealth and distinction--was secretly having an affair with a servant girl. When he decided to completely forget about her and marry the rich woman he was arranged with, the servant girl killed herself by jumping off a cliff. The servant girl's mother, who practiced witchcraft, retaliated by placing a curse on the entire Wilhern family: every daughter would thereafter be born ugly, doomed to spend their lives as lonely social outcasts. The curse could only be broken if one of the daughter's own kind--presumably a blue-blooded type--learns to accept her for who she is. The Wilhern family was lucky for many years because, by some strange twist of fate, they produced only sons (the one exception was the result of an affair, so the curse had no effect). Then came Penelope, the daughter of the elite and famous Franklin and Jessica Wilhern (Richard E. Grant and Catherine O'Hara). Because they didn't want the press to see her pig-like facial features, the Wilherns faked Penelope's death.And this leads me back to why she's now having trouble finding a husband; the instant they see Penelope's face, every suitable blue-blooded candidate either runs off or dramatically throws himself out the window. They have to sign a confidentiality agreement before meeting her, one stating that the Wilherns' lawyers won't talk if they don't talk first. The only candidate who didn't sign anything was Edward Vanderman, Jr. (Simon Woods), and this is bad because he immediately runs to the police after seeing Penelope's face and escaping the Wilhern estate. Of course, no one believes what he says (then again, his description of Penelope is grossly exaggerated). But by chance, he meets Lemon (Peter Dinklage), a reporter who had a bad encounter with Jessica when Penelope was born; while he believes Edward's story, he knows that without proof of Penelope's existence, the press would never be willing to print it.Here enters Max (James McAvoy), a down-on-his-luck musician who spends most of his time competing in underground Poker games. Because Lemon believes him to be from a wealthy family, he persuades Max to pose as a spousal candidate and secretly take pictures of Penelope. After engaging with him through a two-way mirror, she lets him see her face; his knee-jerk reaction convinces her that no one will ever look past her face, despite what her desperate, overbearing mother tells her. She decides to run away from home, not because she hates her family, but because she finally wants see the sights of the city.A trip to a local bar introduces Penelope to the streetwise Annie (Reese Witherspoon), a character who has no real significance other than to be an extra character. However, it is through her that Penelope's face is publicly exposed, resulting in a whirlwind journey through the world of celebrity. But has Penelope actually made some friends, or are they nothing more than the frenzied fans of a pig-faced freak? Jessica believes it's the latter, which is why she's completely unsupportive of her daughter's newfound fame. All she's concerned with is matching Penelope up with a rich suitor, because the sooner she's married, the sooner the family curse is broken.Max, meanwhile, realizes that he has feelings for Penelope, pig nose and all. He also realizes how wrong he was to introduce himself under false pretenses and toy with her affections. But now he has to work doubly hard since Edward has reentered Penelope's life. Penelope also has some work to do, especially when it comes to discovering who she really is. Sure, she may find a blue-blooded young man to marry, but will that ultimately have any affect on the curse? Finding Mr. Right is one of the themes of ""Penelope,"" but it's definitely not the main theme--at its core, the film is a self-esteem fable, telling a story that instills age-old ideas about liking yourself even when others are putting you down. I'm surprised this idea hasn't worn itself out since it's been used many, many times before. Then again, theme wasn't that important here. Neither is story, for that matter. I was more interested in the title character as a person, simply because she's a young woman that's strong and vulnerable at the same time. That's the one thing about her more noticeable than the nose on her face.",4,The Girl Without a Face,1204243200,"02 29, 2008",2008,5384,"['Penelope', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'born', 'nose', 'ears',

1131766,A1OVYZPXPB0RKB,B0011N1WE8,"C.J. Darlington ""Author of Thicker Than Blood...","[4, 5]","The premise is simple--there's a curse on the Vaderman family, and Penelope (Christina Ricci) is caught in its cross hairs. Born with a pig's nose and ears, she's lived her whole life in solitude. Her overprotective parents (Catherine O'Hara and Simon Woods) can't bear the thought of her being treated like a freak. So rather than let her develop character outside, they've kept her locked away inside their mansion, away from the cruel dark world. This unfortunately sends the message to their beloved daughter that looking different is the worst of all fates.There's only one way the curse can be broken. Once Penelope is loved by one of her own kind the pig nose will disappear. So her mother has made it her mission in life to find her daughter a suitable, blue-blooded gentleman to marry. It's no easy task. Every guy who gets close enough to see Penelope's nose in all its glory ends up jumping out of a window to escape. But then Max (James McAvoy) shows up with an ulterior motive, and things take a turn no one expected. Could he be the one?At first glance you might not think a movie about an otherwise beautiful young woman with a snout could be both entertaining and inspiring. It's true that in less skilled hands this film could've been comedic to the point of ridiculous. It could've overemphasized its message. Thankfully it's done neither. Penelope blends humor into its fairtale premise with all the right flourishes. Catherine O'Hara in particular delivers the best dead-pan lines. Reese Witherspoon's supporting but all too short role as a street-wise courier who befriends Penelope reminds us why America awarded her its People's Choice Award for Favorite Female Movie Star and Favorite Leading Lady in 2008. She's also one of Penelope's producers, so her influence runs even deeper than her performance.Viewers looking for romance won't be disappointed. James McAvoy delivers yet another terrific performance here as a scruffy, down-on-his-luck gambler. This time around his accent is American, and he pulls it off well. Though why an actor with a Scottish accent in real-life would go American in a film that appears to take place in Britain is a little confusing. And am I the only one who can't stop thinking of him as Mr. Tumnus of Narnia fame? Perhaps the stand-out role belongs to Peter Dinklage, a reporter with slightly nefarious intentions and a nagging conscience. Interestingly, Dinklage also has a Narnia connection. He's slotted to play Trumpkin the dwarf in Prince Caspian.Without giving too much away, let's just say there is certainly some predictability in the film's plot. But that's to be expected in the romance/comedy genre. Yet Penelope manages a refreshing twist you might not see coming.Rated PG for some language (h-- and d-- are uttered several times), and a few off color remarks, Penelope is still a film families can enjoy together. Maybe it won't win an Oscar, but Penelope's top-notch cast and redeeming storyline make it worth the drive if it's not in your local theater. Hopefully this little gem won't get lost in the shuffle of the blockbusters.--Reviewed by C.J.

Gone are the days when a nice story that let you escape from the crazy world was okay. Now days if a movie isn't ""realistic"" enough then it's not worth seeing. What is up with that? I don't know about others but I like to go to movies to ESCAPE reality for awhile. Leave behind the stresses in my own life and let a story of some little happily ever after take me on a journey that will leave me with a smile.This wonderful movie and it's many reviews only reaffirms what I've long ago discovered and accepted. If the critics thinks it's not worth the film it's recorded on then I'll probably love it. Such is the case with Penelope. In fact, the less than rave reviews by many only made me want to see it more and I wasn't disappointed.Not only do I pretty much never agree with the critics but I now more than every have very little faith in the profession as a whole. It really comes down to the fact that a movie review is merely an opinion. An opinion that not everyone shares and therefore only counts for so much. A critic does not necessarily like all genre's of movies in which case if they aren't a chick flick kind of person then of course their review is going to be less than stellar.  Whatever.In a wonderful *Fantasy* world (fantasy being the key word, people) that's reminiscent of Pushing Daisies (thought technically this one came first) a young woman named Penelope finds happiness and peace with the trials life has dealt her and when it's all said and done she learns loving yourself as you are is enough, but you can still get your prince in tarnished armor in the end as well.I thought this movie was everything wonderful. The story, the sets, the costumes and the performances by an amazing cast left me grinning like a fool every time I left the theater. I'm growing less tolerant for a lot of the garbage floating around these days so when I find a movie like this or Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium that has a wonderful story and remains refreshingly clean I can't help but love it and want to see it again and again. I love the soundtrack, I can't wait for the DVD and I suppose those who don't like it, it's just their loss. I myself can't stand horror flicks.

1131772,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B0011N1WE8,David Baldwin,"[2, 2]","""Penelope"" disproves the reigning Hollywood wisdom that bigger is better in fantasy films.  It offers what the big boys who routinely throw $200,000,000 into their projects cannot-a heart.  The film is in equal measures Hans Christian Anderson, Walt Disney and Tim Burton with its own askewed sensibility.  The primary message of the film is that beauty is in the eye of the beholder and skin deep so love the skin your in.  It's a message that resonates throughout and the makers of ""Penelope"" do not make it cynically.  Christina Ricci beautifully projects Penelope's fragility which makes the character more alluring despite sporting a snout for a nose.  Catherine O'Hara is a joy as her overprotective mother.  Reese Witherspoon, who produced the film, has a bit as Penelope's best friend.  Russell Brand has a smallish part as James McAvoy's associate.  I recommend this wholeheartedly as not only a great family film but a great film in a league with ""Babe"", another film featuring a hero with a porcine nose.

Directed by first-timer Mark Palansky and written by sitcom veteran Leslie Caveney (Everybody Loves Raymond), the film was shelved for over a year until it was released in February to mostly apathetic reviews. That's a shame since there is a certain charm generated by the fractured fairy tale being told. Palansky shows a surprisingly light touch for someone who has apprenticed under the aegis of Michael Bay on bombastic schlock likePearl HarborandArmageddon, but Caveney's screenplay frequently comes across as plodding and repetitive when the story should feel beguiling. Still, it somehow saves itself by the end thanks primarily to a game cast.The plot follows the sad tale of Penelope Wilhern, an heiress subject to a multi-generational curse when her 19th-century ancestors refused to allow one of their own to marry a servant girl. As the first girl born in the family since that injustice, Penelope is burdened with a pig's snout and can return to normalcy when a fellow aristocrat vows to love her for life. Her obsessive, superficial mother Jessica hides Penelope away in the mansion, even faking her death when a tabloid photographer threatens to take a picture. As Penelope comes of age, Jessica uses a professional matchmaker to line up potential suitors, but they all jump out the window when they see Penelope's supposedly hideous face. One particular aristocrat goes public with what his sighting of Penelope, but of course, there is another candidate, a disheveled, gambling jazz pianist named Max, who does fall in love with her. I was wondering why producer Reese Witherspoon didn't cast herself in the title role given her box office clout, but Ricci is the more suitable choice with her otherworldly stares and naturally pouty manner.The problem is that Ricci (beyond not being a proven bankable draw) looks like she has intentionally applied prosthetic makeup to herself. Rather than looking grotesque, she just looks cartoonishly cute. Witherspoon does cast herself but in a small role as Annie, a Vespa-riding messenger who is Gregory Peck to Ricci's Audrey Hepburn on Penelope'sRoman Holiday-style adventure. Witherspoon hasn't been this relaxed and likable since she became a star. As Max, the omnipresent James McAvoy (who seems to be suffering from the same level of overexposure Jude Law did a few years back) is more in his element here than as the smitten, heroic soldier inAtonement. In what feels like a nod to her role as the panicked mother inHome Alone, the redoubtable Catherine O'Hara generates most of the laughs as Jessica, but her constant shrieking gets repetitive. Peter Dinklage has a few nicely sinister moments as the tabloid photographer. The eclectic soundtrack is highlighted by the Sigur Ros'Hopp&iacute;polla. The only significant extra on the 2008 DVD is a disposable six-minute making-of featurette.",4,Self-Esteem Lessons Inform a Modern-Day Fractured Fairy Tale with a Game Cast,1216512000,"07 20, 2008",2008,3136,"['Considering', 'played', 'white-trash', 'nymphomaniac', 'chained', 'radiator', 'last', 'film', 'saw', 'Black', 'Snake', 'Moan', 'was', 'actually', 'relieved', 'see', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'play', 'sheltered', 'girl', 'standing', 'born', 'pig', 'snout', 'whimsical', '2008', 'parable', 'self-acceptance', 'Directed', 'first-timer', 'Mark', 'Palansky', 'written', 'sitcom', 'veteran', 'Leslie', 'Caveney', 'Everybody', 'Raymond', 'film', 'was', 'shelved', 'year', 'was', 'released', 'February', 'mostly', 'apathetic', 'reviews', 'shame', 'certain', 'charm', 'generated', 'fractured', 'fairy', 'tale', 'being', 'told', 'Palansky', 'surprisingly', 'light', 'touch', 'someone', 'who', 'apprenticed', 'aegis', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'bombastic', 'schlock', 'likePearl', 'HarborandArmageddon', 'Caveney', 'screenplay', 'frequently', 'across', 'plodding', 'repetitive', 'when', 'story', 'should', 'feel', 'beguiling', 'Still', 'somehow', 'end', 'thanks', 'primarily', 'game', 'cast.The', 'plot', 'sad', 'tale', 'Penelope', 'Wilhern', 'heiress', 'subject', 'multi-generational', 'curse', 'when', '19th-century', 'ancestors', 'refused', 'allow', 'one', 'own', 'marry', 'servant', 'girl', 'first', 'girl', 'born', 'family', 'injustice', 'Penelope', 'burdened', 'pig', 'snout', 'can', 'return', 'normalcy', 'when', 'fellow', 'aristocrat', 'love', 'life', 'obsessive', 'superficial', 'mother', 'Jessica', 'Penelope', 'away', 'mansion', 'even', 'faking', 'death', 'when', 'tabloid', 'photographer', 'take', 'picture', 'Penelope', 'age', 'Jessica', 'professional', 'matchmaker', 'line', 'up', 'potential', 'suitors', 'jump', 'out', 'window', 'when', 'see', 'Penelope', 'supposedly', 'hideous', 'face', 'One', 'particular', 'aristocrat', 'public', 'what', 'sighting', 'Penelope', 'course', 'candidate', 'disheveled', 'gambling', 'jazz', 'pianist', 'named', 'Max', 'who', 'fall', 'love', 'was', 'wondering', 'why', 'producer', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'did', ""n't"", 'cast', 'title', 'role', 'given', 'box', 'office', 'clout', 'Ricci', 'more', 'suitable', 'choice', 'otherworldly', 'stares', 'naturally', 'pouty', 'manner.The', 'problem', 'Ricci', 'not', 'being', 'proven', 'bankable', 'draw', 'intentionally', 'applied', 'prosthetic', 'makeup', 'herself', 'Rather', 'looking', 'grotesque', 'just', 'cartoonishly', 'cute', 'Witherspoon', 'cast', 'small', 'role', 'Annie', 'Vespa-riding', 'messenger', 'who', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'Ricci', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', ""Penelope'sRoman"", 'Holiday-style', 'adventure', 'Witherspoon', ""n't"", 'been', 'relaxed', 'likable', 'became', 'star', 'Max', 'omnipresent', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'who', 'be', 'suffering', 'same', 'level', 'overexposure', 'Jude', 'Law', 'did', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'more', 'element', 'here', 'smitten', 'heroic', 'soldier', 'inAtonement', 'what', 'feels', 'nod', 'role', 'panicked', 'mother', 'inHome', 'Alone', 'redoubtable', 'Catherine', ""O'Hara"", 'most', 'laughs', 'Jessica', 'constant', 'shrieking', 'repetitive', 'Peter', 'Dinklage', 'few', 'nicely', 'sinister', 'moments', 'tabloid', 'photographer', 'eclectic', 'soundtrack', 'highlighted', 'Sigur', ""Ros'Hopp"", 'iacute', 'polla', 'only', 'significant', 'extra', '2008', 'DVD', 'disposable', 'six-minute', 'making-of', 'featurette']",N/A

Yes I have to admit that for looking like a pig....well, she doesn't.  You only see her nose.  But really, would anyone want to watch this movie if she really looked like a pig and was &#34;scary&#34; or &#34;ugly.  Also, the suitors screaming and running and jumping out the window to get away...again...really???  It makes for a funny, cute movie though.  The story was about the girl learning to like herself for who she is.  Finding out who she really is.  To love and value herself.  She also found a great guy who loved her, despite her &#34;looks&#34; but wants to see her happy, even if it isn't with him.  She even makes him realize that he wants to be better.  Of course she finds out that she can only be happy with him.  And after the spell is broken and she looks &#34;normal&#34;, oddly enough no one recognizes her. :)Overall, love this movie and will watch it again.",5,Penelope - Would Watch Again,1369785600,"05 29, 2013",2013,1588,"['like', 'good', 'clean', 'movies', 'as', 'clean', 'can', 'get', 'nowadays', 'Penelope', 'was', 'really', 'quite', 'clean', 'was', 'few', 'utterances', 'mild', 'crude', 'language', 'drinking', 'few', 'scenes', 'including', 'bar', 'gambling', 'smoking', 'kissing', 'mild', 'clevage', 'reference', 'ancestors', 'woman', 'had', 'cheated', 'husband', 'couple', 'double', 'entendres', 'sexual', 'innuendos', 'rated', 'PG', 'Dove', 'Foundation', 'approved', '12+.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'will', 'definitely', 'watch', 'again', 'Most', 'people', 'would', 'skip', 'think', 'too', 'predictable', '34', 'lame', '34', 'like', 'movies', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'watching', 'something', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'feel', 'have', 'just', 'been', '34', 'slimed', '34', 'Yes', 'have', 'admit', 'looking', 'pig', '.well', ""n't"", 'only', 'see', 'nose', 'really', 'would', 'anyone', 'want', 'watch', 'movie', 'really', 'looked', 'pig', 'was', '34', 'scary', '34', '34', 'ugly', 'Also', 'suitors', 'screaming', 'running', 'jumping', 'out', 'window', 'get', 'away', 'again', 'really', 'funny', 'cute', 'movie', 'story', 'was', 'girl', 'learning', 'like', 'who', 'Finding', 'out', 'who', 'really', 'love', 'value', 'also', 'found', 'great', 'guy', 'who', 'loved', '34', '34', 'see', 'happy', 'even', ""n't"", 'even', 'realize', 'be', 'better', 'course', 'out', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'happy', 'spell', 'broken', '34', 'normal', '34', 'oddly', 'enough', 'one', 'Overall', 'love', 'movie', 'will', 'watch', 'again']",N/A

Though the plot is rather thin and predictable, the choice cast and production values gives it a luster missing from most films of the 'romantic comedy' genre.The story (written by Leslie Caveny) is narrated by Penelope (Christina Ricci) who takes us back to the days of a curse placed on the wealthy Wilhern family who refused to allow a son to marry the impregnated common girl he loves  and opts instead for a fellow blueblood. The rejected girl leaps of a cliff and the girl's mother places a curse on the family: the firstborn child, if a daughter, born to the clan will have the face of a pig that can be changed only if she is able to find lasting love. Years of firstborn sons trace the curse to contemporary London where the Wilherns (Catherine O'Hara and Richard E. Grant) finally give birth to a firstborn daughter, a dear child who indeed has the nose of a pig.  The parents convince a reporter Lemon (Peter Dinklage) that the child died and was cremated and raise Penelope hidden from the real world outside. Penelope loves life and fills her enclosed space with joy until she becomes of courting age: the parents then make every attempt to secretly introduce her to wealthy young boys, each of whom flees when they see the pig girl in person.Lemon tracks the events, knowing that Penelope still lives, and convinces some cohorts (including Simon Woods as the wealthy but squeamish Edward) to attempt to get photographs of her.  Finally a likely prospect appears in the person of Max (James McAvoy) who apparently has squandered a fortune on gambling and is in desperate need of money.  Max begins a cautious but consistent courtship of Penelope and is even able to look at her without disgust, but when Penelope finds her possible beau is in the game for the money, Penelope flees the 'prison' mansion and goes into the world for the first time (her nose is kept covered with a scarf).  She finds the strange world fascinating, makes friends with a barkeep and a wild living Annie (Reese Witherspoon), and gradually is able to remove her scarf cover only to find that people like her despite her odd appearance.  The concept of self-acceptance is well delivered. The only problem with the story is the manner in which the fable 'sells out' in the all too gratuitous ending.  But the message remains and the films glows with a magic in the way that fables should, much to the credit of sensitive director Mark Palansky and a very fine cast.

Because of Penelope's influence on fashion, sales of scarves skyrocket. Because of Penelope, a young aristrocrat resorts to foul play to rehabilitate his sullied name. And, because of Penelope, maybe next time you'll be more leery of judging a book by its cover.Once upon a time, Penelope Wilhern's great-great-great-grandfather Ralph had a fling with a lowly servant girl, and no way was this going to end well. The blue blood scion eventually comes to his senses, and the distraught servant girl steps off a cliff. The servant girl's vengeful mother - an honest-to-gosh witch - works a dark enchantment on the Wilhern family, to the effect that the next daughter born to the Wilhern bloodline will be cursed with a pig's snout instead of a human nose. And so we meet Penelope.Word has it that not until ""one of her kind"" can learn to love her for herself will the curse be lifted. Penelope's hysterical and ridiculous mom (Catherine O'Hara) is desperate to reverse the spell, not only because she truly does love her daughter, but because it's putting a crimp on her social life. Damn inconvenient when you can't trot out the young heiress because of her unfortunate porcine proboscis.Penelope has led a sheltered life, what with her parents having faked her death when she was a child to avoid the news media's glare. All her life, Penelope has been restricted to the confines of her home, and, surprisingly, she's grown up pretty even-keeled, sweet-tempered, charming. And then she reaches that age in which she can accept suitors, and her mom goes into hyperdrive and starts lining up these young gents to the manor born. She even hires a matchmaker. To no avail.Once these suitors get a gander at Penelope's schnozz, they bolt out of there in horror, frequently bypassing the door in favor of a more expedient window. At 25 years old, even the habitually sunny Penelope is becoming discouraged.Peter Dinklage goes a ways into providing balance to Catherine O'Hara's over-the-top performance. Dinklage is sly and watchable and, for a guy who's at the center of the conflict, is pretty sympathetic. He plays Lemon, an investigative journalist who years ago lost an eye while trying to snap a photo of the urban myth pig girl. Lemon teams up with a disgruntled young aristocrat, one of them candidates what ran off in horror after one glance at Penelope. Two vindictive sorts, they both want to out Penelope, and so hire down-and-out blue blood Max Campion (James McAvoy) to worm his way into an audience with Penelope and then snap away with a hidden camera. Except Max Campion isn't an out and out heel.PENELOPE is in the same vein as CHOCOLAT, AMELIE, and THE MILAGRO GREENFIELD WAR, in that all these films achieve a delicate balance; for the most part, they circumvent the heavy-handed elements. There are bits of social satire (especially in how the media's lens and ink influence the way we view celebrities) and a purposeful nudge towards a fable's sensibility. The only grating thing in PENELOPE is Catherine O'Hara's shrill turn. In all else, it charms the heck out of you. Christina Ricci charms the heck out of you, as does James McAvoy. The marvelous set designs, depicting an idealized New York, helps to establish that light, whimsical tone. It's certainly an empowering tale. I love it that, after endless rejections by prospective Prince Charmings, Penelope gets fed up and strikes out on her own, declares her independence, wanders into the city, buys a scarf. She's soon befriended by Reese Witherspoon's carefree character. And the film goes on to take unexpected and wonderful twists and turns, making PENELOPE my favorite Christina Ricci film of all time.Sadly, the DVD's only bonus feature is ""The Making of a Modern Day Tale"" which is worth watching but all too brief (00:09:30 minutes long).",5,Penelope follows her nose,1307664000,"06 10, 2011",2011,3887,"['Penelope', 'popularity', 'pig', 'Latin', 'banned', 'schools', 'Penelope', 'influence', 'fashion', 'sales', 'scarves', 'skyrocket', 'Penelope', 'young', 'aristrocrat', 'resorts', 'foul', 'play', 'rehabilitate', 'sullied', 'name', 'Penelope', 'maybe', 'next', 'time', ""'ll"", 'be', 'more', 'leery', 'judging', 'book', 'cover.Once', 'time', 'Penelope', 'Wilhern', 'great-great-great-grandfather', 'Ralph', 'had', 'fling', 'lowly', 'servant', 'girl', 'way', 'was', 'going', 'end', 'well', 'blue', 'blood', 'scion', 'eventually', 'senses', 'distraught', 'servant', 'girl', 'steps', 'cliff', 'servant', 'girl', 'vengeful', 'mother', 'honest-to-gosh', 'witch', 'dark', 'enchantment', 'Wilhern', 'family', 'effect', 'next', 'daughter', 'born', 'Wilhern', 'bloodline', 'will', 'be', 'cursed', 'pig', 'snout', 'instead', 'human', 'nose', 'so', 'meet', 'Penelope.Word', 'not', 'one', 'kind', 'can', 'learn', 'love', 'herself', 'will', 'curse', 'be', 'lifted', 'Penelope', 'hysterical', 'ridiculous', 'mom', 'Catherine', ""O'Hara"", 'desperate', 'reverse', 'spell', 'not', 'only', 'truly', 'love', 'daughter', 'putting', 'crimp', 'social', 'life', 'Damn', 'inconvenient', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'trot', 'out', 'young', 'heiress', 'unfortunate', 'porcine', 'proboscis.Penelope', 'led', 'sheltered', 'life', 'what', 'parents', 'having', 'faked', 'death', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'avoid', 'news', 'media', 'glare', 'life', 'Penelope', 'been', 'restricted', 'confines', 'home', 'surprisingly', 'grown', 'up', 'pretty', 'even-keeled', 'sweet-tempered', 'charming', 'then', 'age', 'can', 'accept', 'suitors', 'mom', 'hyperdrive', 'lining', 'up', 'young', 'gents', 'manor', 'born', 'even', 'matchmaker', 'avail.Once', 'suitors', 'get', 'gander', 'Penelope', 'schnozz', 'bolt', 'horror', 'frequently', 'bypassing', 'door', 'favor', 'more', 'expedient', 'window', '25', 'years', 'old', 'even', 'habitually', 'sunny', 'Penelope', 'becoming', 'discouraged.Peter', 'Dinklage', 'ways', 'providing', 'balance', 'Catherine', ""O'Hara"", 'over-the-top', 'performance', 'Dinklage', 'sly', 'watchable', 'guy', 'who', 'center', 'conflict', 'pretty', 'sympathetic', 'Lemon', 'investigative', 'journalist', 'who', 'years', 'ago', 'lost', 'eye', 'trying', 'snap', 'photo', 'urban', 'myth', 'pig', 'girl', 'Lemon', 'up', 'disgruntled', 'young', 'aristocrat', 'one', 'candidates', 'what', 'ran', 'off', 'horror', 'one', 'glance', 'Penelope', 'Two', 'vindictive', 'sorts', 'want', 'Penelope', 'so', 'hire', 'down-and-out', 'blue', 'blood', 'Max', 'Campion', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'worm', 'way', 'audience', 'Penelope', 'then', 'snap', 'away', 'hidden', 'camera', 'Max', 'Campion', ""n't"", 'out', 'heel.PENELOPE', 'same', 'vein', 'CHOCOLAT', 'AMELIE', 'THE', 'MILAGRO', 'GREENFIELD', 'WAR', 'films', 'achieve', 'delicate', 'balance', 'most', 'part', 'circumvent', 'heavy-handed', 'elements', 'are', 'bits', 'social', 'satire', 'especially', 'how', 'media', 'lens', 'ink', 'influence', 'way', 'view', 'celebrities', 'purposeful', 'nudge', 'fable', 'sensibility', 'only', 'grating', 'thing', 'PENELOPE', 'Catherine', ""O'Hara"", 'shrill', 'turn', 'else', 'heck', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'heck', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'marvelous', 'set', 'designs', 'depicting', 'idealized', 'New', 'York', 'establish', 'light', 'whimsical', 'tone', 'certainly', 'empowering', 'tale', 'love', 'endless', 'rejections', 'prospective', 'Prince', 'Charmings', 'Penelope', 'fed', 'up', 'strikes', 'out', 'own', 'independence', 'wanders', 'city', 'scarf', 'soon', 'befriended', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'carefree', 'character', 'film', 'take', 'unexpected', 'wonderful', 'twists', 'turns', 'making', 'PENELOPE', 'favorite', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'film', 'time.Sadly', 'DVD', 'only', 'bonus', 'feature', 'Making', 'Modern', 'Day', 'Tale', 'worth', 'watching', 'too', 'brief', '00:09:30', 'minutes', 'long']",N/A

Of course, according to the legend, she supposedly needs a ""worthy"" groom to stick around long enough to break the curse but that is beginning to seem rather hopeless.What I liked...-Being that Beauty and the Beast is one of my favorite fairy tales the storyline really caught my attention. Penelope is an enjoyable re-telling of a classic story with some cute plot twists.-The setting is quirky with retro and modern elements. I found the sets and locations to be charming, imaginative, and worth examining.-The cast was great! Sometimes I regret casting choices but that could hardly be said for this film. Christina Ricci and Reese Witherspoon were fabulous and that is only the half of it!-Aside from the fact that this is, at face value, a really charming tale there is a moral to the story.What I didn't like...Honestly, I could not come up with anything I did not like.In summary...Really, this is a very cute film and I highly recommend it. There are scenes with gambling and alcohol but I think most people would feel comfortable sharing Penelope with their children. The content is very family friendly and it is rated PG.Overall, I think is a great film for romantics of all ages and I believe you will be as pleasantly surprised as I was!",5,A Charming Tale!,1243641600,"05 30, 2009",2009,1446,"['Poor', 'Penelope', 'cursed', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'face', 'pig', 'also', 'must', 'suffer', 'seemingly', 'endless', 'parade', 'prospective', 'suitors', 'who', 'flee', 'fear', 'very', 'sight', 'course', 'according', 'legend', 'supposedly', 'worthy', 'groom', 'stick', 'around', 'long', 'enough', 'break', 'curse', 'beginning', 'seem', 'rather', 'hopeless.What', 'liked', '-Being', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'one', 'favorite', 'fairy', 'storyline', 'really', 'caught', 'attention', 'Penelope', 'enjoyable', 're-telling', 'classic', 'story', 'cute', 'plot', 'twists.-The', 'setting', 'quirky', 'retro', 'modern', 'elements', 'found', 'sets', 'locations', 'be', 'charming', 'imaginative', 'worth', 'examining.-The', 'cast', 'was', 'great', 'Sometimes', 'regret', 'casting', 'choices', 'could', 'hardly', 'be', 'said', 'film', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'were', 'fabulous', 'only', 'half', '-Aside', 'fact', 'face', 'value', 'really', 'charming', 'tale', 'moral', 'story.What', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Honestly', 'could', 'not', 'come', 'up', 'anything', 'did', 'not', 'like.In', 'summary', 'Really', 'very', 'cute', 'film', 'highly', 'recommend', 'are', 'scenes', 'gambling', 'alcohol', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'sharing', 'Penelope', 'children', 'content', 'very', 'family', 'friendly', 'rated', 'PG.Overall', 'think', 'great', 'film', 'romantics', 'ages', 'believe', 'will', 'be', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'was']",N/A

Its message of self-acceptance is obvious but not heavy handed, and worth talking about afterward. A modern-day fairy tale, the movie begins with the traditional line ""Once upon a time..."" but soon becomes a twisted take onBeauty and the Beast. In this case, it's the princess with the curse that turns her ugly. Can she learn to love herself?Well of course she can. The journey that pig-nosed heroine Penelope travels is not at all believable, but then again fairy tales rarely are. If you give yourself over to the uplifting moral -- that everyone is lovable and interesting BECAUSE of their differences, not in spite of them -- then this film is a treat. The energetic cinematography aptly depicts both grime and splendor, the costumes are loaded with detail (I especially loved Penelope's coat with mismatched buttons) and though the script drags at times, it has many unexpected twists and turns that keep things entertaining.Though Christina Ricci does a good job expressing herself behind a snout, the real performance here is that of James McAvoy. Given the task of playing Prince Charming as a washed-up musician with a gambling problem, McAvoy glows with charismatic star power. The shaggy haired, sleepy-eyed actor doesn't look like your typical leading man, but when he is onscreen the movie hums. Catherine O'Hara and Richard E.

There were only two comments that were suggestive and both were more double-entendre than outright crude.Clever writing and storytelling.Max's soulful eyes.Mean people got theirs.What I didn't loveThe emphasis on drinking -- I was amazed at how many scenes had a character either talking about drinking or actually doing it.Penelope's friends weren't really developed as friends.The key relationship for Penelope was either not fleshed out enough or was resolved too quickly.Her parents stayed in fairy tale la-la-land but Penelope grew up.I will buy this film because I loved more than I didn't, and my kids are older.

Her parents try to arrange a marriage for her; she falls for a commoner; they hide from the press until Penelope decides to break free. In the end, everybody gets more or less what they deserve.What's good about this movie? Fascinating cast from top to bottom, great camera work, some crisp and amusing dialog. I was particularly fond of Peter Dinkledge as the journalist who is both driven to uncover photos of the deformed girl and sympathetic to her plight. Perhaps as a dwarf he is uniquely aware that physical oddities ought not define one's life and normality does not guarantee happiness, but the script never has his character spell this out and the resulting portrayal is perhaps the most interesting in the film. He's funny too. Some of the original plot elements worked well (the public's embrace of Penelope once she presents herself, and the crowds of young women in Penelope masks for Halloween in particular).What's bad? Unfortunately, that's a longer list. Penelope is supposed to be so grotesque that every man who sees her tries to jump out a window to escape. Yet she is played by Christina Ricci, looking entirely lovely except for her pig nose. She is also feisty, smart, and educated, and the premise that all men flee her fails because she is so obviously desirable. Ricci's acting is curiously flat. The tone of her narration, in particular, seems disconnected with the life experience of the character.The film seeks to condemn superficiality, and yet embraces it too (spoiler -- Ricci gets a normal nose before the end). The shallowness of Catherine O'Hara's character was brutal and borderline mysogynistic. The reliance on magic was cheap and weakened the film, especially the butler's pointless final scene. The use of accents was bizarre. The story seems to be set in London, but none of the Americans in the cast bother with English accents and some of the Brits in the cast sport American accents. There is no consistency and the effect is of a production that had gotten away from the director. Richard E. Grant is almost entirely wasted. The ending is dissatisfying.

She was doomed generations before her birth by a curse to ancestor. The spell, to be cast on the first female descendent, can only be broken by ""love from one of her kind"" (or something like that). Hence, her mother (Catherine O'Hara) sets about to have her meet thoroughly shallow blue-blood suitors and keep Penelope in doors. But difficulties ensue. What if Penelope's secret gets out? Is Penelope's damaged self-esteem reparable? Is her curse breakable?Characters are well sketched and entertaining. Penelope herself is a genuinely lovely and sweet soul, and her most appealing suitor Max (James McAvoy) is thoroughly likeable and attractive. Though I am not a fan of most movie romances, I was rooting for them to overcome the odds and get together. Penelope's mother is simultaneously sympathetic, monstrously enfuriating, and hilarious. Simon Woods is also funny as a repulsively repulsed suitor, and Peter Dinklage is subtle but amusing as a reporter determined to photograph Penelope.

Enter Johnny, a scruffy, down-on-his-luck compulsive gambler hired by an investigative reporter to infiltrate Penelope's house to see if the rumors of a pig-nosed girl residing therein are indeed true.  But can this principled cad help falling in love with the ""real,"" ""beautiful"" Penelope who lies just beneath the surface of this grotesquely swinish exterior? (Though, if truth be told, if you`re going to be stuck going through life with a pig-nose, you could do a lot worse than the one Penelope is forced to put up with here).As to ""Penelope"" itself, it doesn't bode well for any film when most of the minor players have English accents and most of the major ones do not - especially when, without exception, everyone is ostensibly playing a British character.  Beyond that, this ""beauty is only skin deep"" parable hasn't been accorded the wit or imagination it would actually need to be successful.  The fairy tale ambiance has been reasonably well adapted to the modern scene, but the narrative arc that comes along with it could hardly be more transparent or predictable.In addition, the movie, written by Leslie Caveny and directed by Mark Palansky, is replete with overwrought slapstick scenes of people screaming, running, diving out of windows, etc. at the mere sight of Penelope's face - scenes that, quite frankly, feel as if they were lifted straight out of an episode of ""The Munsters.""Still, an appealing cast, made up of the likes of Christina Ricci, James McAvoy, Reese Witherspoon, Peter Dinklage, Richard E. Grant, Catherine O`Hara, and Simon Woods, at least makes the movie watchable - if you`re in the mood for this sort of thing, that is.",2,blandly predictable modern-day fairy tale,1254787200,"10 6, 2009",2009,2067,"['**1/2Due', 'curse', 'was', 'placed', 'family', '19th', 'Century', 'otherwise', 'attractive', 'British', 'high', 'society', 'blueblood', 'name', 'Penelope', 'Wilhern', 'was', 'born', 'pigs', 'ears', 'snout', 'one', 'would', 'imagine', 'put', 'something', 'damper', 'poor', 'girl', 'dating', 'life', 'prospective', 'romantic', 'partners', 'invariably', 'run', 'screaming', 'room', 'moment', 'first', 'lay', 'eyes', 'Enter', 'Johnny', 'scruffy', 'down-on-his-luck', 'compulsive', 'gambler', 'hired', 'investigative', 'reporter', 'infiltrate', 'Penelope', 'house', 'see', 'rumors', 'pig-nosed', 'girl', 'residing', 'therein', 'are', 'indeed', 'true', 'can', 'principled', 'cad', 'help', 'falling', 'love', 'real', 'beautiful', 'Penelope', 'who', 'just', 'beneath', 'surface', 'grotesquely', 'swinish', 'exterior', 'truth', 'be', 'told', 're', 'going', 'be', 'stuck', 'going', 'life', 'pig-nose', 'could', 'do', 'lot', 'worse', 'one', 'Penelope', 'forced', 'put', 'up', 'here', '.As', 'Penelope', ""n't"", 'bode', 'well', 'film', 'when', 'most', 'minor', 'players', 'have', 'English', 'accents', 'most', 'major', 'ones', 'do', 'not', 'especially', 'when', 'exception', 'everyone', 'ostensibly', 'playing', 'British', 'character', 'Beyond', 'beauty', 'only', 'skin', 'deep', 'parable', ""n't"", 'been', 'accorded', 'wit', 'imagination', 'would', 'actually', 'need', 'be', 'successful', 'fairy', 'tale', 'ambiance', 'been', 'reasonably', 'well', 'adapted', 'modern', 'scene', 'narrative', 'arc', 'along', 'could', 'hardly', 'be', 'more', 'transparent', 'predictable.In', 'addition', 'movie', 'written', 'Leslie', 'Caveny', 'directed', 'Mark', 'Palansky', 'replete', 'overwrought', 'slapstick', 'scenes', 'people', 'screaming', 'running', 'diving', 'windows', 'etc', 'mere', 'sight', 'Penelope', 'face', 'scenes', 'quite', 'frankly', 'feel', 'were', 'lifted', 'straight', 'episode', 'Munsters', 'Still', 'appealing', 'cast', 'made', 'likes', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'Peter', 'Dinklage', 'Richard', 'E.', 'Grant', 'Catherine', 'O', 'Hara', 'Simon', 'Woods', 'least', 'movie', 'watchable', 're', 'mood', 'sort', 'thing']",N/A
1131840,A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB,B0011N1WE8,"Sarah ""Eat Dessert First""","[4, 5]","Penelope is a modern-day fairytale involving a family curse: as revenge for an unjust death, a witch curses the Wilherns so that their first daughter will be born with the face of a pig. For several generations, only males are born, but when Penelope (Christina Ricci) comes along, the curse is fulfilled, and she's born with a pig's snout. Her parents (Catherine O'Hara from Beetlejuice and and Richard E. Grant channeling Christopher Walken) keep her locked away after faking her death so that the paparazzi will steer clear.Now in her mid-twenties, the sheltered Penelope has several talents, including botany, chess, and music (and Penelope's vintage glam costumes are to die for). She's a voracious reader as well, with a library full of rare, valuable first editions. Every week, her overbearing mother makes her meet several potential suitors (bluebloods) in an attempt to break the curse: in order for that to happen, Penelope must be loved by ""one of her own kind."" Most jump out the second-story window in horror when they see Penelope face-to-face, describing her as a gruesome monster (in all fairness, the pig makeup is underwhelming; I saw her face and went, ""that's it?!?""). The butler's job is to catch the escaping suitors to prevent them from blabbing to the press, but one particularly loathsome character, Edward Vanderman the Third (Simon Woods), escapes and sensationalizes Penelope into a drooling, savage monster with razor-sharp fangs; the story is printed on the front page of local newspapers, complete with caricature straight out of the Exorcist.At the same time, down-and-out gambler Max (James McAvoy,Rory O'Shea Was Here,Becoming JaneandThe Last King of Scotland (Widescreen Edition)) accepts $5,000 for secretly snapping photos of Penelope, and pretends to be genuinely interested in her brains, not her looks. Predictably, the two feel a genuine attraction before long, but Max's secret as a spy is discovered, and he's banished from the house. The rest of the film focuses on Penelope's escape and quest for independence.Quirky, with loveable characters and some not-so-loveable ones rounding out the cast, Penelope feels like a lost Tim Burton film; the zany dialogue reminded me of Beetlejuice at points, as did the dark, twisted visuals. The message of ""love who you are, not what you look like"" is beat over your head about a million times, and Catherine O'Hara as the stage mom is particularly loathsome as she obsesses over plastic surgery for Penelope and other ways to make her daughter ""normal."" But I found Penelope to be an engaging fairytale, if a little long, in large part due to the sparkling performances of Ricci and McAvoy.On a final note, it appears that Penelope has been edited from the theatrical version, with several scenes shortened and some swearing removed. Also, according to posters at IMDB, the music has also been redone. This is a shame, and in large part it's due to some confused marketing; although this would appear to be a children's fairy tale, it's largely adult (Penelope becomes drunk, steals her mother's credit card, etc., there's a blatant sexual reference from Reese Witherspoon's character), and should never have been marketed primarily as addressed towards children. Hopefully, the original theatrical version will be released at some point. Extras include an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at Twilight (a new scene, some behind-the-scenes footage, and brief interviews with director Catherine Hardwicke, author Stephenie Meyer, and several of the stars).",4,"Believe in yourself, not your appearance",1217548800,"08 1, 2008",2008,3540,"['Penelope', 'modern-day', 'fairytale', 'involving', 'family', 'curse', 'revenge', 'unjust', 'death', 'witch', 'Wilherns', 'first', 'daughter', 'will', 'be', 'born', 'face', 'pig', 'several', 'generations', 'only', 'males', 'are', 'born', 'when', 'Penelope', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'along', 'curse', 'fulfilled', 'born', 'pig', 'snout', 'parents', 'Catherine', ""O'Hara"", 'Beetlejuice', 'Richard', 'E.', 'Grant', 'channeling', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'keep', 'locked', 'away', 'faking', 'death', 'paparazzi', 'will', 'steer', 'clear.Now', 'mid-twenties', 'sheltered', 'Penelope', 'several', 'talents', 'including', 'botany', 'chess', 'music', 'Penelope', 'vintage', 'glam', 'costumes', 'are', 'die', 'voracious', 'reader', 'as', 'well', 'library', 'full', 'rare', 'valuable', 'first', 'editions', 'week', 'overbearing', 'mother', 'meet', 'several', 'potential', 'suitors', 'bluebloods', 'attempt', 'break', 'curse', 'order', 'happen', 'Penelope', 'must', 'be', 'loved', 'one', 'own', 'kind', 'Most', 'jump', 'second-story', 'window', 'horror', 'when', 'see', 'Penelope', 'face-to-face', 'describing', 'gruesome', 'monster', 'fairness', 'pig', 'makeup', 'underwhelming', 'saw', 'face', 'went', 'butler', 'job', 'catch', 'escaping', 'suitors', 'prevent', 'blabbing', 'press', 'one', 'particularly', 'loathsome', 'character', 'Edward', 'Vanderman', 'Third', 'Simon', 'Woods', 'escapes', 'Penelope', 'drooling', 'savage', 'monster', 'razor-sharp', 'fangs', 'story', 'printed', 'front', 'page', 'local', 'newspapers', 'complete', 'caricature', 'straight', 'Exorcist.At', 'same', 'time', 'down-and-out', 'gambler', 'Max', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'Rory', ""O'Shea"", 'Was', 'Here', 'Becoming', 'JaneandThe', 'Last', 'King', 'Scotland', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', '5,000', 'secretly', 'snapping', 'photos', 'Penelope', 'be', 'genuinely', 'interested', 'brains', 'not', 'looks', 'Predictably', 'two', 'feel', 'genuine', 'attraction', 'long', 'Max', 'secret', 'spy', 'discovered', 'banished', 'house', 'rest', 'film', 'Penelope', 'escape', 'quest', 'independence.Quirky', 'loveable', 'characters', 'not-so-loveable', 'ones', 'rounding', 'out', 'cast', 'Penelope', 'lost', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'film', 'zany', 'dialogue', 'reminded', 'Beetlejuice', 'points', 'did', 'dark', 'twisted', 'visuals', 'message', 'love', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'what', 'look', 'beat', 'head', 'million', 'times', 'Catherine', ""O'Hara"", 'stage', 'mom', 'particularly', 'loathsome', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'Penelope', 'other', 'ways', 'make', 'daughter', 'normal', 'found', 'Penelope', 'be', 'engaging', 'fairytale', 'little', 'long', 'large', 'part', 'due', 'sparkling', 'performances', 'Ricci', 'McAvoy.On', 'final', 'note', 'Penelope', 'been', 'edited', 'theatrical', 'version', 'several', 'scenes', 'shortened', 'swearing', 'removed', 'Also', 'according', 'posters', 'IMDB', 'music', 'also', 'been', 'redone', 'shame', 'large', 'part', 'due', 'confused', 'marketing', 'would', 'appear', 'be', 'children', 'fairy', 'tale', 'largely', 'adult', 'Penelope', 'drunk', 'mother', 'credit', 'card', 'etc.', 'blatant', 'sexual', 'reference', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'character', 'should', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'marketed', 'primarily', 'addressed', 'towards', 'children', 'Hopefully', 'original', 'theatrical', 'version', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'point', 'Extras', 'include', 'exclusive', 'behind-the-scenes', 'look', 'Twilight', 'new', 'scene', 'behind-the-scenes', 'footage', 'brief', 'interviews', 'director', 'Catherine', 'Hardwicke', 'author', 'Stephenie', 'Meyer', 'several', 'stars']",N/A

And of course -- being biased towards anything that starts with ""Once upon a time"" -- I just had to see it. And although it's taken me a year, I sure am glad I've seen it now.And it's pretty much what I expected: charming, whimsical , and romantic. Oh, and hilarious.  The hilarious bit I did not expect, but it is filled with golden, laugh-out-loud moments.The narrative is very storybook-style, and the writing is quite clever, because as soon as I thought I knew how the rest of the film would play out, it changed.  The production design and music were also very strong, and fit the rest of the film perfectly.Christina Ricci is luminous and sweet, and James McAvoy is wonderful and always a pleasure to look at, but it was the supporting cast really impressed me. Peter Dinklage, Catherine O'Hara, Richard E. Grant, Reese Witherspoon, and Simon Woods made this movie sparkle.My only complaints were that I couldn't quite make up my mind what the message/moral of the story was trying to get across (""love yourself the way you are"" or ""only beautiful people get happy endings?""). The ending seemed to fizzle out a bit.  And there is a good handful of awkward, cheesy moments.  But they are over quickly enough, and at the end of the day, it's still two hours well spent.I'm going to try to show Penelope to as many people as I can, and I definitely recommend you try it out, too.",5,Honestly?

She is completely sheltered at first, for reasons you will soon discover, but lusts to learn about life. Although the scenario is a little extreme in this movie (and rightfully so for the plot), wanting to escape one's bubble of protection and having a desire to learn about things with an unassuming curiosity, marks one as getting ready for an adult life that is not narrow.As the story progresses she realizes that she must accept herself as she is, flaws and all. It also showcases the changes that one person can go through after meeting a catalyst in the form of another person or should I say after meeting the ""right"" person. Please note that the ""right"" person does not mean only the romantic interest because as you will see that even the platonic relationships in this movie cause change. Not everyone in the movie benefit from their experiences though... you will see that too.What I love best about this movie is the fact that the romance develop in the background of these life changes. The boy and girl spend time searching for a sense of self and purpose independently. They explore themselves and discover what they really want instead of just having hormones dictate what is best.

Essentially a reversed Beauty and the Beast, the film manages to be delightful occasionally, but as revolting as a pig-faced child during much of the character development and progression of romance.When a misguided Wilhern blueblood falls in love with a common woman and then backs out of a marriage to save his noble name, the distraught girl commits suicide. Her furious mother (who is conveniently a witch) places a curse on the first baby girl to be born into the bloodline. After generations of nothing but male heirs to the sizeable estate, Penelope (Christina Ricci) is finally born, a girl with the cursed ears and nose of a pig. Penelope is locked away and raised alone - her parents constantly worried about how the cruel outside world might react to her abnormalities. While some believe in the legend and others do not, Penelope's only hope of undoing her hideous bovine appendages is to find a fellow blueblood that will love and accept her as she is.As she learns to live with constant rejection, her parents struggle to keep her away from the media and from other people, first by faking her death, and then by holing her away in their luxurious mansion. To preserve the wealth in the family, her parents attempt to marry her off with a huge dowry, but suitor after suitor runs away in terror. One-eyed photographer Lemon (Peter Dinklage) uses sniveling blueblood Edward Vanderman (Simon Woods) and down-on-his-luck gambler Max Campion (James McAvoy) to get a picture of the pig-girl for use in his newspaper. When Penelope runs away, Max finds himself falling for her when no one else can bear to look in her direction.Is this film really about looking beyond the physical features of a person to discover their inner beauty? Or is it that rich people suck? Whatever the case may be, it's difficult to believe the message about inner beauty when Christina Ricci is gorgeous even with the pig makeup. The themes of the film are often lost amongst the bits of comedy that rarely evoke laughter and the shallow character development that causes these paper-thin personas to lose steam almost immediately. The blossoming romance between Max and Penelope is amateurishly insincere and the dialogue that accompanies their flirtations is largely farfetched. Regardless of the message, the execution in storytelling is notably disorderly. Right from the get-go Penelope feels like a live-action recreation of a motif from Shrek, in which the comical green man decides Fiona is perfect as an ogre.The large amount of cameos in Penelope almost make this film worth watching, although some of them are just obscure enough that they might not fall into the category of a cameo. Nick Frost from ""Hot Fuzz"" and ""Shaun of the Dead"" shows up, as does Lenny Henry, from the 1990's BBC show ""Chef!"". Supporting roles consist of Richard E. Grant from ""Withnail and I"" fame as Penelope's father, and Catherine O'Hara (For Your Consideration) as her mother. Simon Woods does an excellent job as the whiny aristocrat who will do anything to preserve his high-class name, and Ricci is unquestionably pleasant to watch.Sadly, Penelope works better as a thought-provoking concept than a feature length movie, and the interesting idea is quickly buried amongst the painfully mediocre dialogue and commonplace plot points.- Mike Massie",2,Penelope Movie Review,1204243200,"02 29, 2008",2008,3521,"['rather', 'childish', 'blend', 'comedy', 'romance', 'unearthing', 'morals', 'prejudices', 'Penelope', 'story', 'horribly', 'disfigured', 'woman', 'searching', 'mythical', 'cure', 'monstrous', 'curse', 'Essentially', 'reversed', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'film', 'be', 'delightful', 'occasionally', 'as', 'revolting', 'pig-faced', 'child', 'much', 'character', 'development', 'progression', 'romance.When', 'misguided', 'Wilhern', 'blueblood', 'love', 'common', 'woman', 'then', 'marriage', 'save', 'noble', 'name', 'distraught', 'girl', 'commits', 'suicide', 'furious', 'mother', 'who', 'conveniently', 'witch', 'curse', 'first', 'baby', 'girl', 'be', 'born', 'bloodline', 'generations', 'nothing', 'male', 'heirs', 'sizeable', 'estate', 'Penelope', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'finally', 'born', 'girl', 'cursed', 'ears', 'nose', 'pig', 'Penelope', 'locked', 'away', 'raised', 'alone', 'parents', 'constantly', 'worried', 'how', 'cruel', 'world', 'might', 'react', 'abnormalities', 'believe', 'legend', 'others', 'do', 'not', 'Penelope', 'only', 'hope', 'undoing', 'hideous', 'bovine', 'appendages', 'find', 'fellow', 'blueblood', 'will', 'love', 'accept', 'live', 'constant', 'rejection', 'parents', 'struggle', 'keep', 'away', 'media', 'other', 'people', 'first', 'faking', 'death', 'then', 'holing', 'away', 'luxurious', 'mansion', 'preserve', 'wealth', 'family', 'parents', 'attempt', 'marry', 'off', 'huge', 'dowry', 'suitor', 'suitor', 'away', 'terror', 'One-eyed', 'photographer', 'Lemon', 'Peter', 'Dinklage', 'sniveling', 'blueblood', 'Edward', 'Vanderman', 'Simon', 'Woods', 'down-on-his-luck', 'gambler', 'Max', 'Campion', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'get', 'picture', 'pig-girl', 'use', 'newspaper', 'When', 'Penelope', 'away', 'Max', 'falling', 'when', 'one', 'else', 'can', 'bear', 'look', 'direction.Is', 'film', 'really', 'looking', 'physical', 'features', 'person', 'discover', 'inner', 'beauty', 'rich', 'people', 'suck', 'case', 'may', 'be', 'difficult', 'believe', 'message', 'inner', 'beauty', 'when', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'gorgeous', 'even', 'pig', 'makeup', 'themes', 'film', 'are', 'often', 'lost', 'amongst', 'bits', 'comedy', 'rarely', 'evoke', 'laughter', 'shallow', 'character', 'development', 'paper-thin', 'personas', 'lose', 'steam', 'almost', 'immediately', 'blossoming', 'romance', 'Max', 'Penelope', 'amateurishly', 'insincere', 'dialogue', 'flirtations', 'largely', 'farfetched', 'Regardless', 'message', 'execution', 'storytelling', 'notably', 'disorderly', 'Right', 'get-go', 'Penelope', 'feels', 'live-action', 'recreation', 'motif', 'Shrek', 'comical', 'green', 'man', 'Fiona', 'perfect', 'ogre.The', 'large', 'amount', 'cameos', 'Penelope', 'almost', 'make', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'are', 'just', 'obscure', 'enough', 'might', 'not', 'fall', 'category', 'cameo', 'Nick', 'Frost', 'Hot', 'Fuzz', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'up', 'Lenny', 'Henry', '1990', 'BBC', 'show', 'Chef', 'Supporting', 'roles', 'consist', 'Richard', 'E.', 'Grant', 'Withnail', 'fame', 'Penelope', 'father', 'Catherine', ""O'Hara"", 'Your', 'Consideration', 'mother', 'Simon', 'Woods', 'excellent', 'job', 'whiny', 'aristocrat', 'who', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'preserve', 'high-class', 'name', 'Ricci', 'unquestionably', 'pleasant', 'watch.Sadly', 'Penelope', 'better', 'thought-provoking', 'concept', 'feature', 'length', 'movie', 'interesting', 'idea', 'quickly', 'buried', 'painfully', 'mediocre', 'dialogue', 'commonplace', 'plot', 'points.-', 'Mike', 'Massie']",N/A

Chase scenes are not predictable. Penelope covers, in a few comical moments, what else would a person do who was confined to one house their entire life? I enjoyed the ""who's real"" and ""who's fake"" process of elimination and how one copes when you only find the latter. The characters are well-crafted and played by some of my favorite people, obviously Christina Ricci, but also minor characters played by Burn Gorman (Torchwood - The Complete First Season), Nick Frost (Hot Fuzz (3-Disc Collector's Edition)andShaun of the Dead), and the ever-watchable (getting all the laughs when I saw the movie) Peter Dinklage which you've seen inThe Station AgentandDeath at a Funeral, plus Marianne Faithfull is in it (uncredited) and she really is as great looking as I remember her from the brief appearance she made in BBC'sAbsolutely Fabulous - Absolutely Everything.

James McAvoy [who was s very dashing in Becoming Jane] is a bit slovenly in appearance here, but is charming nevertheless.
