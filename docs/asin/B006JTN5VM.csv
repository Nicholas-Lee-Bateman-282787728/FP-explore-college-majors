The visuals of DA:DotS were barely tolerable (oddly, I thought it looked better with lots of action and worse when it was still frames).  I stopped watching after about a half-hour because the voice acting and the writing were so bad I couldn't see myself making it through another hour.  The voice actors lacked the level of quality I've come to expect from shows like Legend of Korra or Young Justice.  The writing/pacing was awful, the pauses between lines of poorly written dialog drove me crazy.I'm so glad I didn't pay hardly anything for this.  Luckily, I have family who are into anime (and Dragon Age), so they may appreciate this more.",2,"Disappointed, even if it's my own fault",1340582400,"06 25, 2012",2012,749,"['do', ""n't"", 'hate', 'anime', 'universally', 'enjoyed', 'FFVII', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'cheap', 'computer', 'animation', 'visuals', 'DA', 'DotS', 'were', 'barely', 'tolerable', 'oddly', 'thought', 'looked', 'better', 'lots', 'action', 'worse', 'when', 'was', 'still', 'frames', 'stopped', 'watching', 'half-hour', 'voice', 'acting', 'writing', 'were', 'so', 'bad', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'making', 'hour', 'voice', 'actors', 'lacked', 'level', 'quality', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'shows', 'Legend', 'Korra', 'Young', 'Justice', 'writing/pacing', 'was', 'awful', 'pauses', 'lines', 'poorly', 'written', 'dialog', 'drove', 'crazy.I', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'pay', 'hardly', 'anything', 'Luckily', 'have', 'family', 'who', 'are', 'anime', 'Dragon', 'Age', 'may', 'appreciate', 'more']",Dragon Age: Dawn of the Seeker
1516677,A11PRT1CCVHB52,B006JTN5VM,"B. Daniel ""ComicBOOK Lover""","[1, 1]","I was really really lookin forward to this. I loved the first game, and have only briefly played the second. I really am in love with this world and I think this anime really added to it. The action could've been better, but the story was decent. And it really gave us our first look at the World of Dragon Age outside of Ferelden. We get to see some of Orlais, and even get to see the Vatican City inspired holy city. It was truly a site to behold, as well as the return of Dragons. I'd really like to see an actual anime series or something that gets to cameo or feature major players like the King and Cassandra who is the main character here, but a minor but important one in DA2 (her interrogations of the Dwarf Varric frame the narrative). So if you liked the games I suggest this film.

1516678,A3TTKMUH9REXNH,B006JTN5VM,"Christopher Perry ""Azazel2099""","[2, 3]","As a Dragon Age nut this movie wasn't half bad at all. The key to this is you need to go into the movie with no epic expectations. You do that and the movie is pretty decent all things considered. It is by no means perfect or amazing but decent and worthy of the Dragon Age title. The animation is relatively decent which I was honestly not expecting. However, there are some cheesy dialogue lines by Cassandra espeically at the very end when she screams ""For The Chantry!"". To some it up this is a decent installment to the Dragon Age franchise, this is NO where near the same type of movie as Felicia Day's cheesy low budget Dragon Age title.

Dawn of the Seeker is probably one of the best movie adaptations of a video game, and THE BEST in my opinion.

I won't spoil it, but there's an elf mage girl with abilities that are so unique she'd make a good companion character.I came away from the movie more than satisfied with my purchase, a deeper knowledge of the Dragon Age universe, and a new respect for Cassandra (Which is probably necessary before playing Inquisition)",4,THE BEST video game spinoff movie I've ever seen,1402358400,"06 10, 2014",2014,652,"['always', 'kind', 'hated', 'Cassandra', 'had', 'spare', 'money', 'decided', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'get', 'Redemption', 'Dawn', 'Seeker', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'movie', 'adaptations', 'video', 'game', 'THE', 'BEST', 'opinion', 'have', 'story', 'worthy', 'Bioware', 'game', 'characters', 'unique', 'personalities', 'abilities', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'elf', 'mage', 'girl', 'abilities', 'are', 'so', 'unique', ""'d"", 'make', 'good', 'companion', 'character.I', 'came', 'away', 'movie', 'more', 'satisfied', 'purchase', 'deeper', 'knowledge', 'Dragon', 'Age', 'universe', 'new', 'respect', 'Cassandra', 'Which', 'probably', 'necessary', 'playing', 'Inquisition']",Dragon Age: Dawn of the Seeker
1516681,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B006JTN5VM,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[1, 1]","When it comes to video games, the Canadian video game developer BioWare is famous for creating successful video game franchises such as ""Baldur's Gate"", ""Neverwinter Nights"", ""Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic"", especially the popular ""Mass Effect"" series.And in 2009, BioWare created ""Dragon Age"", a successful dark fantasy role-playing video game whichled to a sequel, ""Dragon Age II"" in 2011 and since have spawned novels, a Facebook game, a Flash game, a tabletop game, comic books, action figures, a web series and now, an animated film which was co-produced by BioWare, Electronic Arts and FUNimation Entertainment.The animated film is directed by Fumihiko Sori, best known for his directed the live film ""Ping Pong"", but for animation, known for his style of anime featured in the films ""Appleseed"" and ""Vexille"".The animated film was released in theaters in Japan in Feb. 2012 and in the United States in May 2012.  The film will also be released via Blu-ray/DVD combo on May 29th.As ""Dragon Age: Origins"" took place in the country of Ferelden, in the continent of Thedas, gamsrs were introduced to the race and background of a Human Noble, Magi, Daish/City elf, dwarf commoner/noble but most importantly to the Dragon Age mythology.While there is a connection between ""Dragon Age II"" to the ""Dragon Age: Dawn of the Seeker"", in order to be accessible to a large audience who have never played the video game, a short narration is given on the state of the world.  But the  film features a younger Cassandra Pentaghast.VIDEO:""Dragon Age: Dawn of the Seeker"" is an animated film that has Fumihiko Sori's style.  Presented in 1080p High Definition, ""Dragon Age: Dawn of the Seeker"" looks fantastic on Blu-ray.For those familiar with ""Applessed"", ""To"" or ""Vexille"", it's a unique style that Sori films are known for.  That is to feature beautiful background art, well-detailed surfaces, may it be vehicles, structures or in this case, dragons.  But most importantly, it's the design of his characters.  Some may say ""over-exposed"" or a ""shiny"" look.  It's unlike any other anime film and it's Sori's style of creativity and when you see this style, you know he's involved.Sori is also known for having his films showcase black levels and shadow details.  Everything is pretty deliberate when it comes to the look of Fumihiko Sori's work and whether or not you like it, I personally have enjoyed Sori's animated films and see how far he can take his films and trying to incorporate realistic movements with his animated style.  And for the most part, he is able to accomplish a style that is much different from ""Vexille"" and also ""Appleseed: Ex Machina"", but you can tell from this film of how far Sori films have come since ""Appleseed"".AUDIO:""Dragon Age: Dawn of the Seeker"" is presented in English and Japanese Dolby TrueHD 5.1 and because the film's many action sequences, the film sounds absolutely impressive.  Great use of the surround channels, as well as LFE and dialogue and the musical score by Tetsuya Takahashi is crystal clear.  But things really do get immersive towards the final action sequences in the film and for the most part, audiophiles should be pleased with the lossless soundtrack.And as far as the voice acting goes, both English and Japanese voicework are well-done.  Both Colleen Clinkenbeard and Chiaki Kuriyama do a magnificent job with their voice role for Cassandra Pentaghast and for J-Rock fans, I'm sure many will love the fact that Gackt does the voice of the Knight Commander.Subtitles are in English.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Dragon Age: Dawn of the Seeker"" comes with the following special features:Bioware Studio Tour - (7:56) Mike Laidlaw (Creative Director of ""Dragon Age"") gives viewers a tour of BioWare's Edmonton studio.Dawn of the Seeker Backstage Pass - (20:40) Featuring BioWare and FUNimation staff discussing the film, the visual design of the characters, the characters in the film and how the movie came about.Dragon Age Production Art - View various sketches and art created during production of ""Dragon Age: Dawn of the Seeker"".Previews - FUNimation Entertainment and BioWare trailersEXTRAS:""Dragon Age: Dawn of the Seeker"" comes with a Blu-ray and two DVD's featuring the English feature film and the Japanese version of the feature film.  Also, included is a code for a free download of a ""Dragon Age: The Silent Grove"" digital-exclusive comic which can be redeemed from Dark Horse Comics' online store.  Also, the Blu-ray release comes with a slipcover case.JUDGMENT CALL:I have probably watched ""Dragon Age: Dawn of the Seeker"" four times now and part of the excitement of why I enjoyed this film is because of the work of Fumihiko Sori and his staff.  The look and feel of the animated film was very cool and I was very impressed by the 3D rendering of the dragons and also how beautiful the landscapes and structure were.  The Blu-ray really does a magnificent job in showcasing the detail plus the various colors of the film, may it be the dark blacks to the vibrant outdoor, day colors.And for ""Dragon Age"" fans, especially those who have played ""Dragon Age II"", will get a kick out of watching a storyline that revolves around a younger Cassandra Pentaghast.  Also, for the fans who have watched the web series ""Dragon Age: Redemption"" and seeing the tie-in between Cassandra and the characters of ""Redemption"".As for the film itself, while I do feel that ""Dragon Age: Dawn of the Seeker"" will appeal to ""Dragon Age"" fans, fortunately the storyline is accessible to those who have never played the ""Dragon Age"" video games.  Writer Jeffrey Scott (who worked on the animated TV series ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"", ""Dragon Tales"", ""Mega Man"", ""Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog"")  was able to make a straightforward screenplay that doesn't get too convoluted in Dragon Age mythos.  All you need to know is that Cassandra is a seeker, an important position within the Chantry and that she is on a mission to uncover a conspiracy within the Chantry and also how it relates to the Blood Mages.The film itself is rather violent, has a lot of blood, major loss of body parts and thus the reason for the TV MA rating.  But for those who enjoy this genre will find ""Dragon Age: Dawn of the Seeker"" to be more to their liking and may entice them in playing the video game series.The Blu-ray release looks and sounds magnificent and I was pretty impressed of how Sori's films have gotten better in look since his work on ""Appleseed"" and for audiophiles, the film also has its fair share of awesome moments during action sequences in producing an immersive environment.  As for special features, I did enjoy the studio tour of the BioWare Edmonton studio and also interviews with crew of BioWare and also Funimation but I was hoping to see a few more special features.  May it be an audio commentary or even featurette involving the Japanese side who worked on the film.Overall, ""Dragon Age: Dawn of the Seeker"" is an enjoyable, action-packed film that will appeal to ""Dragon Age"" fans or those who love the action/adventure genre with swordfighting, monsters, dragons and sorcery.  While not a groundbreaking film, it's an animated film full of action and looks and sounds absolutely great on Blu-ray and features that Fumihiko Sori style that I enjoy watching!  The film takes place within the Dragon Age universe and showcases the origins of ""Dragon Age II"" characters Cassandra Pentaghast and Divine Justinia V.  And most of all... who doesn't love a strong female character who can kick major ass!?""Dragon Age"" fans and action/adventure fans...""Dragon Age: Dawn of the Seeker"" is recommended!",4,"""Dragon

1516682,AYG1U47VFZ165,B006JTN5VM,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[9, 15]","Gaming properties present a unique opportunity for filmmakers.  First, there's a guaranteed, built-in audience surrounding the franchise, one that will favorably lap up almost anything poured into the trough in hopes that it'll enhance the gaming experience.  Second, there's an established property - no need to have to think up everything fresh and new to this already established world - so drafting a story might come a bit easier or, at least, a bit less daunting.  Third, there's terrific crossover AND `crossback' potential - fans of a new film may very well go back and purchase versions of the game in order to rediscover this new fantasy, and existed fans will be far more likely to invest in the newest version of the game now that they've been dipped back into this realm of imagination.However, therein lies one specific problem: when crafting a film based on a popular video gaming franchise, it's important not to speak directly in the virtual shorthand already established - the characters, the worlds, the situations, etc. - because you might only disillusion newcomers with a story whose background relies on having played the game ... and methinks that's the greatest shortcoming of DRAGON AGE: DAWN OF THE SEEKER.As I've said (and had to say often, as of late), I'm no gamer, so I can't speak to how well the films accurately depicts the world of DRAGON AGE.  I can't address how well the various races introduced here - these knights, these mages, these wizards, and these mystical rulers in long flowing robes - relate to the gaming experience.  What I can say is that, right out of the gate, I was more than a healthy bit confused as to what was going on - why had these wizards kidnapped this young maiden, how did they know she held the secret they'd long sought, who commanded these knights who showed up to rescue her, and what was up with all these dragons?  So far as this viewer was concerned, a healthy bit was lost in the translation; it wasn't until about thirty minutes in that I had a better understanding - one that, at least, answered some of the questions that could've (and should've) been laid out earlier - and all of it started to make sense.Still, as one who loves a good fantasy yarn, DAWN OF THE SEEKER has plenty to offer by way of action and adventure.  Cassandra - a brave and beautiful young `Seeker' (basically a knight for all practical intents and purposes) - must rise up to confront and expose the conspiracy behind the religious ruling order, known as the Chantry of Andraste.  Her chief problem?  She's hotheaded and quick to act without thinking about the consequences.  It'll take a newfound maturity - that and the companionship of a young mage only at a cusp of discovering his magical powers - for her to win the day, drive the evil knights from her fellowship, and stop the dragons from marauding her fabled kingdom.See?  Doesn't that sound exciting?It did to me, but there's quite a bit of DAWN OF THE SEEKER that falls flat.  For state-of-the-art animation and storytelling, there's a lot here that just didn't work for the uninitiated viewer.  Right out of the gate, I had more questions than could be answered with any degree of screenwriting logic.  As I've always said, once I understood the world as it was being presented, it was much easier to understand the narrative, but the film never successfully achieved the level of coherence I would've wanted, and this was due in large part because Cassandra - our lead hero - was never really someone I related to.  Part-Knights-Templar and part-Shakespearean-shrew, she's brimming over with an anger that never gets `humanized.'  Granted, that can be a difficult task for any animated motion picture, but seeing how Disney and Pixar do it every day I would think it to be an easier task than what comes across here.That, and, no matter how many times Cassandra loses her sword (a big no-no for a knight), it's always back in her possession just in time for the next action sequence.  She can fall out of the sky on the back of a dragon, but, once she hits the ground, she's perfectly fine; she simply gets up and runs off on her next adventure.  At what point did the script explain her invulnerability to danger?  Given the fact that she gets manhandled quite readily elsewhere by lowly humans, why is it she can take the brunt of a swipe from these goliath-sized lizards and get back up without so much as a bruise or a scrape?  It defies logic, and, due to the fact it never gets fully explained, it only serves to weaken the picture almost to the point of silliness - never a good thing, even in a film inspired by a game.What works here are the dragons.  They've been given some of the best attention-to-detail and animation ever committed to a film.  They're real creatures here - living, breathing demons with wings who belch fire and howl with tremendous power - the things that fill the nightmares of valiant warriors.  Not all of DAWN's animation works - it gravitates heavily between obvious CGI and little more than average Saturday morning TV fare - but they're put great love into the dragons, and, on that point alone, the film's worth watching.  Too bad they get so little attention until the last action pieces.The film comes from BIOWARE and Toneplus Animation Studios with FUNimation as a contributing partners.  It looks and sounds pretty grand, though I'll admit I had some trouble with characters' audio in the early part of the film.  The disc has a handful of special features, but the one I enjoyed the most was the tour of BioWare's Studios along with the behind-the-scenes look at how the film was conceived on through the creative process.  Otherwise, it was all a bit standard stuff.  The Blu-ray release is packaged as a Blu+DVD combo pack which is a nice touch.RECOMMENDED for fans of the game (obviously) and even fans of fantasy entertainment will probably find stuff to love here.  DRAGON AGE: DAWN OF THE SEEKER isn't a failure on any level - other than trying to capture relevant, relatable characters in a world where the laws of physics need to be respected - and it contains some of the best dragon sequences committed to film since the 80's underrated gem, DRAGONSLAYER, came and went from screens.  More focus on these huge beasts - along with greater focus on hammering out this magical realm and characters non-gaming viewers can relate to - would've produced something I would've enjoyed more than I did.  Seriously, I wanted to like this one much more than I did.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at FUNimation provided me with a DVD screener copy of DRAGON AGE: DAWN OF THE SEEKER for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",3,2 & 1/2 Stars: DRAGON AGE Never Quite Reaches A Respectable DAWN,1337212800,"05 17, 2012",2012,6736,"['Gaming',

1516683,A1MAQ2ZS6N50QJ,B006JTN5VM,James F. Briggs,"[5, 6]","This movie is definitely meant for the fans more than those who have no idea what Dragon Age is.As a fan of the games I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised. When I first saw it advertised here, I had a bit or morbid curiosity. For the most part Anime has been on a severe decline in quality of story telling and visuals lately, so I was none to pleased to see a Japanese studio handling it. CGI animation has never really been Japan's strong point. Even some of the better CG movies I have seen from them look pretty poor when compared to an American made one. (Appleseed vs Anything by Pixar.) Only exception I can think of I have seen is Final Fantasy Advent Children. I was also concerned about how well a country who's RPG's tend to be of a totally different flavor than western ones, would handle it.I can say happily that they exceeded my expectations.The animation and designs are good. Maybe not great. (would have rather seen it done like the game models used for cutscenes.) but they avoid looking totally stiff and lifeless.The battle sequences. Yeah they fit the dragon age setting. Pretty much everything seen in the movie can be done in the game, or is shown in a game cut scene.So for any fans of Dragon Age I can highly recommend.On another note. Buy the Blueray, even if you do not have a player for it. It comes with the movie on DVD as well and as of May 31st 2012 is almost $10.00 cheaper than the DVD version.For people who do not know much about the games or the setting, it does not rate as high. (3 stars there) It's still an entertaining watch, but you would probably get the feeling one gets when they start reading a book series halfway through.
