CBS video has always done a great job bringing their classic tv shows to DVD compared to the other companies (go back and check out the original  Mission Impossible and Hawaii 5-0 box sets, they look better than most of the shows put out today). Warner Bros comes in a close second but FOX DVD sucks! What they've done with the MTM catalog should be grounds for a murder indictment! Come on guys, if you're not going to release more seasons of St Elsewhere, Hill Street Blues and Bob Newhart then let a third party like Shout or Image have access to them!My only problem with all of the studios is taking forever to release follow up seasons on many of their shows and charging way too much for them!  Don't split them up into half seasons! If $39.99 is good enough for new full season one hour shows being released today, it should be enough for something that's been sitting in your vaults for decades! The price for comedies shouldn't exceed $29.99 for a full season either!",4,Brought back memories,1358985600,"01 24, 2013",2013,1048,"['loved', 'show', 'kid', 'great', 'black', 'white', 'tv', 'CBS', 'video', 'always', 'done', 'great', 'job', 'bringing', 'classic', 'tv', 'shows', 'DVD', 'compared', 'other', 'companies', 'go', 'back', 'check', 'out', 'original', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'Hawaii', '5-0', 'box', 'sets', 'look', 'better', 'most', 'shows', 'put', 'out', 'today', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'close', 'second', 'FOX', 'DVD', 'What', ""'ve"", 'done', 'MTM', 'catalog', 'should', 'be', 'grounds', 'murder', 'indictment', 'Come', 'guys', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'release', 'more', 'seasons', 'St', 'Elsewhere', 'Hill', 'Street', 'Blues', 'Bob', 'Newhart', 'then', 'let', 'third', 'party', 'Shout', 'Image', 'have', 'access', 'only', 'problem', 'studios', 'taking', 'forever', 'release', 'follow', 'up', 'seasons', 'many', 'shows', 'charging', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'Do', ""n't"", 'split', 'up', 'half', 'seasons', '39.99', 'good', 'enough', 'new', 'full', 'season', 'one', 'hour', 'being', 'released', 'today', 'should', 'be', 'enough', 'something', 'been', 'sitting', 'vaults', 'decades', 'price', 'comedies', 'should', ""n't"", 'exceed', '29.99', 'full', 'season']","My Three Sons: Season 2, Vol. 1"

1314499,A1S4RK8CHUQCMD,B002ZTLVYI,"MusicFan ""MusicFan""","[22, 24]","The substituted new music -- apparently because CBS was too cheap to pay for the performance rights of the original, outstanding music score -- comes close to ruining this series.  If you think back to when you saw the show originally, you'll probably remember the whimsical, melodic music that was so prominently featured.  That's not what you get here.  Instead, CBS has put in synthesized music of recent vintage.  I can tell that the musicians who composed the new music were trying hard to get a sound similar to what was originally in the show, but they just can't do it.  Their melodies, while OK, just don't rise to the same heights as those originals, and when the very obvious synthesizer is used in place of a real orchestra, who do they think they're fooling?!?  My Three Sons was from the early 60s, when real orchestral scores were used, not synthesizers.I'm sorry not to be able to give this DVD set 5 stars, because the remaining content of the shows is truly outstanding.  Fred MacMurray, William Frawley, and the sons -- Tim Considine, Don Grady, and Stanley Livingston -- play their parts with both feeling and humor.  The writing is some of the best, most creative (and hilarious) that you'll find anywhere in the history of TV.It's really a shame that, for economic reasons, CBS chose to mar this fine show with synthesized music.  I don't blame the people who refuse to buy it.
