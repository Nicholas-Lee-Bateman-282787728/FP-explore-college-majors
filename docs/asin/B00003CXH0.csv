524627,A3W4GJR5CCADBX,B00003CXH0,"""50cent-haircut""","[1, 2]","The best thing that Sofia Coppola did with &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot; is letting the movie remain close to the Eugenides' novel, both in content and structure. In the DVD commentary, there are some bloated PR material, including her father Francis saying her screenplay was the best script he's read in ten years, etc., which is a laughable claim because almost all of the dialogue is a direct quote from the book, and the structure is unchanged. But it's to the younger Coppola's credit that she winnowed the book's pages with judicious sensitivity.The cinematography is steady and restrained. Some of the tracking shots are beautiful to look at, and Coppola has a wonderful way of framing her actors. The heartbreak of looking at the Lisbon girls as they go through their brief moments of happiness and misery of life comes subtly nuanced and never overly dramatic.One thing the movie does that took away from the mysterious power of the book is that the parents (played by Hepburne and Woods) are 'characterized and fleshed out'. Whereas Eugenides in his book leaves these characters as empty figures, Coppola paints them with broad, Suburban caricaturish strokes, as if to say this is what the girls wanted to escape with their suicides. Of course that must be one of the reasons, but Coppola loses the mythical quality of their mysterious end by intimating an explanation.But all in all, a solid debut: sensitive filmmaking. I will definitely check out Coppola's next project.",4,"A Sensitive, Faithful Representation of the Book",1023926400,"06 13, 2002",2002,1486,"['best', 'thing', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'did', 'quot', 'Virgin', 'Suicides', 'quot', 'letting', 'movie', 'remain', 'close', 'Eugenides', 'novel', 'content', 'structure', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'are', 'bloated', 'PR', 'material', 'including', 'father', 'Francis', 'saying', 'screenplay', 'was', 'best', 'script', 'read', 'ten', 'years', 'etc.', 'laughable', 'claim', 'almost', 'dialogue', 'direct', 'quote', 'book', 'structure', 'unchanged', 'younger', 'Coppola', 'credit', 'winnowed', 'book', 'pages', 'judicious', 'sensitivity.The', 'cinematography', 'steady', 'restrained', 'tracking', 'shots', 'are', 'beautiful', 'look', 'Coppola', 'wonderful', 'way', 'framing', 'actors', 'heartbreak', 'looking', 'Lisbon', 'girls', 'go', 'brief', 'moments', 'happiness', 'misery', 'life', 'subtly', 'nuanced', 'never', 'overly', 'dramatic.One', 'thing', 'movie', 'took', 'away', 'mysterious', 'power', 'book', 'parents', 'played', 'Hepburne', 'Woods', 'are', ""'characterized"", 'fleshed', 'out', 'Whereas', 'Eugenides', 'book', 'characters', 'empty', 'figures', 'Coppola', 'broad', 'Suburban', 'caricaturish', 'strokes', 'say', 'what', 'girls', 'wanted', 'escape', 'suicides', 'course', 'must', 'be', 'one', 'reasons', 'Coppola', 'mythical', 'quality', 'mysterious', 'end', 'intimating', 'explanation.But', 'solid', 'debut', 'sensitive', 'filmmaking', 'will', 'definitely', 'check', 'out', 'Coppola', 'next', 'project']",N/A
524628,AMP7TQRWAIE84,B00003CXH0,"Adrian Cooper ""That Guy from Venus. :D""","[2, 3]","December 25th, 2009The Virgin Suicides is an alright movie that features some good 70s music and then some OK 70s music. It's somewhat of a moody affair and you might have to force yourself to watch it again some day but I think it's worth at least one watch.It starts off with the character that plays 13-year old Cecilia trying to kill herself in the bathtub. Why? I'm still not sure. But she was my favorite character along with her 14-year old sister, Lux played by the oh-so-charming Kirsten Dunst (she looks much older than her character and has gone blond for the role).The sisters live a fairly strict and fenced-in type of life and it only gets worse after Lux doesn't come home on time after the school dance.A lot of things happen in this movie (right?) but I don't wanna spoil the whole plot.I believe this is a PG-13 rated movie but it almost doesn't deserve that rating.There is a bit of kissing, Kirsten's character quickly plays with the belt of a young boy's trousers in the film and during the football field scene, when the dance is taking place she grinds with the school ""hottie"". Oh, and there are scenes where people are shown dead. But they aren't gory mind you.All in all, I think I'd give it a rent and watch it with a friend or two. You will either be half-intrigued or laugh your way through the movie, I'm not sure which one.The theatrical trailer makes the movie seem like it's going to be really good, and well...it falls flat. But if you don't go in this with super-high expectations, you just may like it.3 stars.end note: I will probably watch this once more, but not alone; with a friend. I definitely don't think it's worth owning for me at least but it is somewhat entertaining (plus, he wants to see it so...).Happy Holidays!",3,I hate titles. 3 stars.,1261699200,"12 25, 2009",2009,1763,"['December', '25th', '2009The', 'Virgin', 'Suicides', 'alright', 'movie', 'good', '70s', 'music', 'then', 'OK', '70s', 'music', 'somewhat', 'moody', 'affair', 'might', 'have', 'force', 'watch', 'again', 'day', 'think', 'worth', 'least', 'one', 'watch.It', 'character', '13-year', 'old', 'Cecilia', 'trying', 'kill', 'bathtub', 'Why', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'favorite', 'character', '14-year', 'old', 'sister', 'Lux', 'played', 'oh-so-charming', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'much', 'older', 'character', 'gone', 'blond', 'role', 'sisters', 'live', 'fairly', 'strict', 'fenced-in', 'type', 'life', 'only', 'worse', 'Lux', ""n't"", 'come', 'home', 'time', 'school', 'dance.A', 'lot', 'things', 'happen', 'movie', 'right', 'do', ""n't"", 'wan', 'na', 'spoil', 'whole', 'plot.I', 'believe', 'PG-13', 'rated', 'movie', 'almost', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'rating.There', 'bit', 'kissing', 'Kirsten', 'character', 'quickly', 'belt', 'young', 'boy', 'trousers', 'film', 'football', 'field', 'scene', 'when', 'dance', 'taking', 'place', 'school', 'hottie', 'Oh', 'are', 'scenes', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'shown', 'dead', 'are', ""n't"", 'gory', 'mind', 'you.All', 'think', ""'d"", 'give', 'rent', 'watch', 'friend', 'two', 'will', 'either', 'be', 'half-intrigued', 'way', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'one.The', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'movie', 'seem', 'going', 'be', 'really', 'good', 'well', 'flat', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'super-high', 'expectations', 'just', 'may', 'like', 'it.3', 'stars.end', 'note', 'will', 'probably', 'watch', 'once', 'more', 'not', 'alone', 'friend', 'definitely', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'worth', 'owning', 'least', 'somewhat', 'entertaining', 'see', 'so', '.Happy']",N/A

So sad their sorrow, narrated with soft voice of nostalgia, the boys (all represented by the adult conscience), tell the story of the their object of desire, the sisters are away but much close to them in feelings, so very dearly loved and missed. Cecilia was the first one; third teen must be and unbearable weight to carry on aside long kept hopeless dreams , and so her suicidal tendencies crashed on the house fence. Lux was the last one to die, a glimpse of sadness can be catch when the boys encounters her for the last time, yes some tears are seen, but she does all what she cans to contain them, even sexually touch one of the boy's pants. For a moment everything is a male utopia, the sisters and the boys riding in a car in a lonely freeway from nowhere to nowhere, just for the ride and the human candor of the vestals, from here to eternity.At the end, they are no more. The ones left behind (the boys), begin their painful process of trying to forget the girls, increasing only their desire of knowing the truth about the sister's nature and what drove them to take their lives. The family pictures left on the trashcans, the dairies, and the tenderness of unfinished feelings and memories, they never got to see their true cruel world, even though the sisters understood love and its manifestations, only Lux catch a touch of it, but even Trip deceive her.The Virgin Suicides is a little jewel of fine taste and human love, with real human lust for life, compelling intrigue and boyhood perception of a now forsaken coming of age. Sofia Coppola wrote and directed the Virgin Suicides (her directorial debut), with tremendous insight of the story and their characters optics of decaying atmospheres (an outstanding adaptation of Jeffrey Eugenide's novel). It seems, in the Coppola family, talent is in the blood (What about Sofia's acting skills? Well, according to what we have seen on The God Father, Part III, that's out of the question). Always, the mystery is kept away, the clues are given, but they never fit each other, and we are put in the same situation of the boys, this is masterfully done by an insightful understanding perfectly blended into visual emotions, the key to obtain all the oblivious and provocative mood of the story, the result is lyrically spoken.The songs and original score are in explicit accurate understanding of the screenplay (every time this happens, the cinematographic effect is accomplished with great results).The handsome cast performs a veil of  frustration and delirious lost innocence of psychological attribution, a great work by an ensemble in state of grace. Sofia's direction is emotional, rough and honest, each frame is a pleasure by composition and sound, enhanced by an excellent photography and still moments of virtuoso lighting and direction.The DVD transfer is excellent, the sound captures the necessities of such a great film, with some nice extras (including the traditional Making of).

524638,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00003CXH0,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","One of the best directorial debuts of this generation (especially of this decade), Sophia Coppola's masterful `The Virgin Suicides' is a gritty and emotionally stirring example of cinema's finest.  With a warmth needed to help sell the emotional gravity of the film, without once wavering from the stern and almost callous atmosphere needed to illuminate the harshness of the `reality' presented, Coppola helped establish herself as one of the best visionaries of her generation.Her subsequent films (`Lost in Translation' and `Marie Antoinette') further proved her brilliance.Taking place in the 70's, the film centers around a group of boys and their obsession with the Lisbon sisters.  These girls are the center of their existence, not because they are anything truly special but because they are so mysterious, and their home life (guarded strictly by their overprotective parents) is something of in depth conversation.  When one of the sisters ends her own life, the family spirals down a dark and destructive course that eventually leads to heartbreak and tragedy, but the film (albeit `gloomy') carries an air of light delicacy that beautifully captures the breathtaking quality of innocence that obviously overwhelms these young girls (and the boys who obsess over them).There are few ensemble casts that truly reach that peak of perfection that `The Virgin Suicides' does.  In fact, every performance is perfectly layered with enough gritty realism to elevate their characterizations.  Even small roles inhibited by actors like Josh Hartnett become something truly memorable and enticing.  Kirsten Dunst basically owns this movie, with her sensually frustrated take on Lux, the most compelling and absorbing of the Lisbon sisters.  She bares her acting chops with an effortless fluctuation of frail naivety and startlingly aggressive tenacity.  Kathleen Turner, and especially James Woods, are brilliantly cast as the Lisbon parents.  Woods embodies this character with enough parental warmth to make his outlandish and easily misunderstood actions appear much kinder and warmer than they should.  There is an obvious love there, just misapplied.  Coming from an actor who portrays sly and sinister without batting an eyelash, complete stripping that trait from this character is a marvelous (and commendable) feat.But the star of this show is, without doubt, is Sophia Coppola.  Once the target of cruelty for her horrendous acting talent (she deserved the slaying she received in 1990), Coppola has switched careers (and bold and brilliant move) and established herself as a force in this industry.  Being the daughter of the legendary Francis Ford Coppola, Sophia has big shoes to fill, but she has found her own style, her own niche and her own voice; and she sings loud and clear with each film.Weaving her film through a cascade of identifiable and relatable emotions, Coppola creates a crystal clear masterpiece with `The Virgin Suicides'.

524646,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B00003CXH0,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[180, 206]","'The Virgin Suicides' is a beautiful, understated, and tragic drama, punctuated by great rock music of the late '70s, and featuring terrific performances, particularly by Kirsten Dunst, Josh Hartlett, and a nearly unrecognizable Kathleen Turner. What makes the film even more remarkable is that it is the directorial debut by Francis Ford Coppola's daughter, Sofia, best known prior to this by her less-than-stellar performance in 'Godfather 3'! Her sensitivity with this material establishes her as a director to be reckoned with, and a true talent!The film focuses on the five Lisbon sisters, beautiful, yet repressed by a religious and overly protective mother (Turner), who encourages their intellectual growth, but tries to block any sexual or emotional stirrings. The girls turn their passions into other channels, bonding tightly with one another, and viewing the world as outsiders. When the youngest attempts, then succeeds at killing herself, the family gains an unwanted notoriety, and a group of local boys begin to worship the remaining sisters from afar, gathering materials, and creating a fantasy world about them.Lux, the most beautiful and free-spirited of the sisters (Dunst), attracts the attentions of the most popular boy in school, Tripp (Hartnett), who confuses raging hormones with love, and begins a campaign to 'have' her. Winning the respect of their father (James Woods, in another excellent 'against-type' portrayal), he succeeds in wearing the mother down, and arranges 'dates' for the sisters, so he can take Lux to the Homecoming Dance. The party provides the springboard for the tragedy that gives the film its name, and catapults the girls into icons that the boys who admire them can never forget.There are many reasons to buy this film; Coppola's understanding of how boys and girls interact, and her sure touch with their issues about sexuality; Kirsten Dunst's best performance to date, conveying both sweetness, and barely suppressed erotic desire; Kathleen Turner's breakthrough as a character actress, sacrificing her glamorous persona for a stocky and frumpy matron. There are some excellent cameos, as well, particularly Danny DeVito as a clueless psychiatrist, Scott Glenn as a family priest who offers platitudes instead of comfort, and Michael Par&eacute; as an older Tripp, reminiscing about Lux, and their 'love'.This is a very special film, one that you will not soon forget!

How can you not be at least partially be captured by this movie, unless you somehow skipped your adolescence entirely?I think there is a real essence of the craziness of adolescence here, but portrayed tenderly rather than an &quot;American Pie&quot; style. The four Lisbon sisters, beautiful and quietly intense, would be an obsession in any small community. The neighborhood boys find them to be utterly fascinating, especially because they are so sheltered by their Catholic parents (great performances by James Woods and Kathleen Turner).The movie is heartfelt without being overly depressing, although the girls do go through some serious issues here. I think it is an excellent look at what my friend calls &quot;Catholic guilt,&quot; although I think there's a better, more universal term for what goes on. The lesson is that you can't grow as a person if you are so protected. I see a lot of my overprotected friends (and maybe a smidgen of me) in the Lisbon girls. That teenage rebellion can be so much more devestating if children aren't allowed to live and learn on their own.A quick comment also on an aesthetic quality of the movie. It takes place in the 1970s, and it is filmed a little faded, a little yellow, perhaps like a 20-year-old photograph or a worn postcard.

524650,A20IIR0422G3A5,B00003CXH0,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[1, 5]","`The Virgin Suicides' is Sophia Coppola's first directoral effort, produced by her father's company and based on a novel by Jeffrey Eugenides, and while it has much of the same feel and pace as her widely recognized second effort, `Lost in Translation', it is to be sure inferior to the Bill Murray vehicle for which Coppola received an Academy award for screenplay.The film takes place in an unidentified average American suburban family of mother (Kathleen Turner), father (James Woods), five daughters (headlined by Kirsten Dunst and four relatively unknown actresses), and no dog or cat. One of the very first things one misses about the movie is the kind of intensity one associates with a James Woods performance. This is not to say that he isn't filling his role to a tee, it just means that unlike Murray in `Lost...', he is not the commanding center of interest in the film. He and Turner are almost background to the primary events of the film.The milieu of the story has a strong affinity to the environments explored in `Rebel Without a Cause' and `Carrie', where parents were either weak (Jim Backus in `Rebel...') or over the edge strong as the mother in `Carrie'. The comparison to `Carrie' is even stronger in that the two principle teenaged characters, Dunst and Josh Hartnett play the couple who win the homecoming queen award at the dance which precipitates the main crisis in the movie. Unfortunately, that crisis is far less dramatic than Sissy Spacek's telekinetic rage in `Carrie'. In fact this is one of the hints of the lack of energy in the film. As the `Carrie' dance scene is so well known, I'm surprised the director made no effort to allude to it except by the profound banality of Coppola's blocking.But then, even very good recent movies such as Academy Award nominee `Sideways' and Academy Award winner `American Beauty' are both very understated in their tone. What they have, though is a sound logic behind their characters' actions. In this film, the logic of the main events, the motivations of the suicides of the five daughters is simply not very well laid out. Oddly, the two characters who might shed some light on the reasons for the suicides, the psychiatrist played by Danny DeVito and the priest, played by Scott Glenn, appear in but a single scene each. I have to believe the novel made much more of these two characters.Oddly, as exaggerated and fantastic as the teens' reactions may have been in `Rebel...' and `Carrie', they are probably a more likely reaction to excessive parental weakness / overbearing than a group suicide. What is especially improbable is that four different individuals would react in the same way to the same situation. So, while the plot may have been feasible with a single teenaged girl suicide, four at once is too much to believe in a very realistically presented scenario (One daughter committed suicide early in the film. The remaining four killed themselves near the end of the last act.)Also totally improbable is the collapse of Woods' character into some kind of delusional state that is revealed in but one scene and which occurs before the suicides.I have no regrets about giving away the story, as the ending is obvious in the title and the point of the movie is the characters and not the plot.This is probably a DVD you do not need to own unless you happen to be a student of filmmaking or an over the top fan of `Lost in Translation'. But, I warn you that the absence of the strong Bill Murray performance makes all the difference in the world to these two movies.",4,"Very Good Movie, but no Oscar (or Bill Murray)!",1126656000,"09 14, 2005",2005,3554,"['Virgin', 'Suicides', 'Sophia', 'Coppola', 'first', 'directoral', 'effort', 'produced', 'father', 'company', 'based', 'novel', 'Jeffrey', 'Eugenides', 'much', 'same', 'feel', 'pace', 'widely', 'recognized', 'second', 'effort', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'be', 'sure', 'inferior', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'vehicle', 'Coppola', 'received', 'Academy', 'award', 'screenplay.The', 'film', 'place', 'unidentified', 'average', 'American', 'suburban', 'family', 'mother', 'Kathleen', 'Turner', 'father', 'James', 'Woods', 'five', 'daughters', 'headlined', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'four', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'actresses', 'dog', 'cat', 'One', 'very', 'first', 'things', 'one', 'movie', 'kind', 'intensity', 'one', 'James', 'Woods', 'performance', 'not', 'say', ""n't"", 'filling', 'role', 'tee', 'just', 'Murray', 'Lost', 'not', 'commanding', 'center', 'interest', 'film', 'Turner', 'are', 'almost', 'primary', 'events', 'film.The', 'milieu', 'story', 'strong', 'affinity', 'environments', 'explored', 'Rebel', 'Cause', 'Carrie', 'where', 'parents', 'were', 'either', 'weak', 'Jim', 'Backus', 'Rebel', 'edge', 'strong', 'mother', 'Carrie', 'comparison', 'Carrie', 'even', 'stronger', 'two', 'principle', 'teenaged', 'characters', 'Dunst', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'play', 'couple', 'who', 'win', 'homecoming', 'queen', 'award', 'dance', 'main', 'crisis', 'movie', 'Unfortunately', 'crisis', 'far', 'less', 'dramatic', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'telekinetic', 'rage', 'Carrie', 'fact', 'one', 'hints', 'lack', 'energy', 'film', 'Carrie', 'dance', 'scene', 'so', 'well', 'known', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'director', 'made', 'effort', 'allude', 'profound', 'banality', 'Coppola', 'blocking.But', 'then', 'even', 'very', 'good', 'recent', 'movies', 'such', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominee', 'Sideways', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winner', 'American', 'Beauty', 'are', 'very', 'understated', 'tone', 'What', 'have', 'sound', 'logic', 'characters', 'actions', 'film', 'logic', 'main', 'events', 'motivations', 'suicides', 'five', 'daughters', 'simply', 'not', 'very', 'well', 'laid', 'out', 'Oddly', 'two', 'characters', 'who', 'might', 'shed', 'light', 'reasons', 'suicides', 'psychiatrist', 'played', 'Danny', 'DeVito', 'priest', 'played', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'appear', 'single', 'scene', 'have', 'believe', 'novel', 'made', 'much', 'more', 'two', 'characters.Oddly', 'exaggerated', 'fantastic', 'teens', 'reactions', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'Rebel', 'Carrie', 'are', 'probably', 'more', 'likely', 'reaction', 'excessive', 'parental', 'weakness', 'overbearing', 'group', 'suicide', 'What', 'especially', 'improbable', 'four', 'different', 'individuals', 'would', 'react', 'same', 'way', 'same', 'situation', 'So', 'plot', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'feasible', 'single', 'teenaged', 'girl', 'suicide', 'four', 'once', 'too', 'much', 'believe', 'very', 'realistically', 'presented', 'scenario', 'One', 'daughter', 'committed', 'suicide', 'early', 'film', 'remaining', 'four', 'killed', 'end', 'last', 'act', 'Also', 'totally', 'improbable', 'collapse', 'Woods', 'character', 'kind', 'delusional', 'state', 'revealed', 'one', 'scene', 'suicides.I', 'have', 'regrets', 'giving', 'away', 'story', 'ending', 'obvious', 'title', 'point', 'movie', 'characters', 'not', 'plot.This', 'probably', 'DVD', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'own', 'happen', 'be', 'student', 'filmmaking', 'top', 'fan', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'warn', 'absence', 'strong', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'performance', 'difference', 'world', 'two', 'movies']",N/A

This movie is indeed very difficult to pin down. On the most obvious level I suppose you could classify it as a &quot;drama&quot; but that seems to generic a term for this film. The film gives off different moods in each seen. &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot; seems obvious but is in actuality one of the most fascinating and unconventional movies released in a long time.The plot, loosely speaking, is about a group of young boys who pursue four sisters. At first you will swear that this is a coming of age movie. The film is narrated in the same way as &quot;Stand By Me&quot; or &quot;Sleepers&quot; from the perspective of a much older, wiser main character. In a sense &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot; is a coming of age movie but it is far more somber than any I've seen. While &quot;Stand By Me&quot;, &quot;Sleepers&quot; and &quot;A Bronx Tale&quot; all had huge emotional scenes, &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot; just bottles up all its negativity until you don't know what to think of it. By the title you can probably guess that the sisters all decide to kill themselves, this is a result of living in their oppresive household. The boys are understandably shocked and the film is a chronicle of the events leading up to it.Sofia Coppola does a real good job directing this one. The somber tone is often undercut by scenes of genuine comedy. There is also a romantic element to &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot; which is truly special. Kirsten Dunst gives a great performance as a character who really is the personnification of beauty. Her character is so vague in some respects that she comes across as Godlike. James Woods also turns in one of the most inadevrtantly funny performances of his career. It'a amazing seeing him play the grovelly, weak husband and not the loud mouth. When his daughter's all kill themselves he is so appalled that he spends the rest of the movie inspecting and talking to plants.The soundtrack by Air is also fabulous. It creates a great sense of atmosphere that is sustained throughout the whole film.&quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot; is a very unique film and deserves ot be applauded. There is a Shakespearian element of tragedy recounted here which gives the film much greater scope than it may seem. Soffia Coppola is married to the enormously talented Spike Jonze (of Being John Malkovich fame). With this film she's giving him a run for his money for the most talented filmmaker in the household.",5,A Mysterious Gem.,971740800,"10 17, 2000",2000,2595,"['What', 'quot', 'Virgin', 'Suicides', 'quot', 'most', 'other', 'movies', 'way', 'repeatedly', 'avoid', 'being', 'classified', 'one', 'genre', 'movie', 'indeed', 'very', 'difficult', 'pin', 'down', 'most', 'obvious', 'level', 'suppose', 'could', 'classify', 'quot', 'drama', 'quot', 'generic', 'term', 'film', 'film', 'different', 'moods', 'seen', 'quot', 'Virgin', 'Suicides', 'quot', 'obvious', 'actuality', 'one', 'most', 'fascinating', 'unconventional', 'movies', 'released', 'long', 'time.The', 'plot', 'loosely', 'speaking', 'group', 'young', 'boys', 'who', 'pursue', 'four', 'sisters', 'first', 'will', 'swear', 'coming', 'age', 'movie', 'film', 'narrated', 'same', 'way', 'quot', 'Stand', 'Me', 'quot', 'quot', 'Sleepers', 'quot', 'perspective', 'much', 'older', 'wiser', 'main', 'character', 'sense', 'quot', 'Virgin', 'Suicides', 'quot', 'coming', 'age', 'movie', 'far', 'more', 'somber', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quot', 'Stand', 'Me', 'quot', 'quot', 'Sleepers', 'quot', 'quot', 'A', 'Bronx', 'Tale', 'quot', 'had', 'huge', 'emotional', 'scenes', 'quot', 'Virgin', 'Suicides', 'quot', 'just', 'up', 'negativity', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'think', 'title', 'can', 'probably', 'guess', 'sisters', 'decide', 'kill', 'result', 'living', 'oppresive', 'household', 'boys', 'are', 'understandably', 'shocked', 'film', 'chronicle', 'events', 'leading', 'up', 'it.Sofia', 'Coppola', 'real', 'good', 'job', 'directing', 'one', 'somber', 'tone', 'often', 'undercut', 'scenes', 'genuine', 'comedy', 'also', 'romantic', 'element', 'quot', 'Virgin', 'Suicides', 'quot', 'truly', 'special', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'great', 'performance', 'character', 'who', 'really', 'personnification', 'beauty', 'character', 'so', 'vague', 'respects', 'Godlike', 'James', 'Woods', 'also', 'one', 'most', 'inadevrtantly', 'funny', 'performances', 'career', 'amazing', 'seeing', 'play', 'grovelly', 'weak', 'husband', 'not', 'loud', 'mouth', 'When', 'daughter', 'kill', 'so', 'appalled', 'rest', 'movie', 'inspecting', 'talking', 'plants.The', 'soundtrack', 'Air', 'also', 'fabulous', 'great', 'sense', 'atmosphere', 'sustained', 'whole', 'film.', 'quot', 'Virgin', 'Suicides', 'quot', 'very', 'unique', 'film', 'ot', 'be', 'applauded', 'Shakespearian', 'element', 'tragedy', 'recounted', 'here', 'film', 'much', 'greater', 'scope', 'may', 'seem', 'Soffia', 'Coppola', 'married', 'enormously', 'talented', 'Spike', 'Jonze', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'fame', 'film', 'giving', 'run', 'money', 'most', 'talented', 'filmmaker', 'household']",N/A

In this case we have a seemingly normal family of a mother, father and 5 daughters. The children seem normal enough except the youngest, Cecilia, determines that she does not want to live anymore. We are given a hint as to why after her first attempt as she explains what is wrong with her life to an ER doctor. Since this movie was set in the 1970's in Michigan I guess they did not have mandatory 72 hour hospital stays after a suicide attempt like we do today in most staes. As Cecilia's character is revealed we are made to understand that she does seem to have some infatuation about death and or things dying,etc. She talks to her mother about the impending extinction of the brazilian turbot frog. She is also very interested in the death of the trees around her neighborhood do to bug infestation. Then there's the mother. Here she is extremely strict concerning boys and keep a dominating control over the girls to excess. Even though the girls range from age 13 through 17 the mother will not let them date or even spend time away from home to visit girlfriends, etc.. The girls are prisoners in there own home. Eventually this condition effects the rest of the girls and tragedy strikes like domino's which permanently change to makeup of the family. I would highly recommend this movie for adults.

She uses soft lenses, cool pastel tones, moody 70s music (including 2 great Heart songs), and an abundance of quintessentially feminine props (i.e. lipstick, unicorn stickers, tampons, pantyhose) to create a sense of cool, ""feminine"" ambience.  Barely emerging from this girly-ness are the film's primary characters, the fated Lisbon sisters.  I say that they barely emerge, because we really don't get to know the Lisbons.  We know their faces, their clothes, their mannerisms - but nothing more.  They tend to blend together, creating more of a hollow group-character than solid individual characters (although Lux, played by Kirsten Dunst - is fleshed out considerably more than the other girls).  Lack of characterization, however, is not a *fault* of Coppola.  Rather - it is a key element of the film.`The Virgin Suicides' is narrated by an adult man, who grew up in the Lisbon girls' neighborhood.  As an adolescent, he and his friends watched, dreamed about, and lusted for the Lisbon sisters from afar.  Even though they are not given hefty screen time, everything we see in this film has been filtered through the eyes, minds, and memories of these neighborhood boys. Hence the reason we never really get to know the girls; the boys never knew the girls.  For them, the Lisbons were simply signs - signs of femininity, purity, and objectivity.  It is plausible that the boys - although they did make attempts to call and visit the girls - never really even wanted to get to know them.  Look at the scene with Lux and high school hunk Trip (played by Josh Hartnett) on the football field together.  Despite his evident desire and arguable affection, he could not handle the coalescence of the reality of Lux Lisbon with his fantasy-girl.So we are left with only glimpses.  Glimpses of young women who are trying to negotiate societal expectations of feminine decorum, the unreasonable desires of their male peers, and their own need to assert individuality.  These are truly heavy issues that almost every young woman must face.  And if you are one of the reviewers who are totally taken aback by the sisters' suicides - well - ""you don't know what it's like to be a thirteen year old girl.""It is important to note that this is a very subtle, and slow-moving film.  If you tend to like a movie with a lot of dialogue, action, and plot-development - you might find be frustrated.  However, if you can appreciate a brooding, moody piece of art - then I definitely recommend `The Virgin Suicides.'",5,a dangerous fantasy world,1126051200,"09 7, 2005",2005,2768,"['Virgin', 'Suicides', 'marks', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'daughter', 'acclaimed', 'director', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'think', 'safe', 'say', 'talent', 'runs', 'family.I', 'was', 'immediately', 'drawn', 'Coppola', 'haunting', 'vision', '1970s', 'Michigan', 'suburbia', 'soft', 'lenses', 'cool', 'pastel', 'tones', 'moody', '70s', 'music', 'including', '2', 'great', 'Heart', 'songs', 'abundance', 'quintessentially', 'feminine', 'props', 'i.e', 'lipstick', 'unicorn', 'stickers', 'tampons', 'pantyhose', 'create', 'sense', 'cool', 'feminine', 'ambience', 'Barely', 'emerging', 'girly-ness', 'are', 'film', 'primary', 'characters', 'fated', 'Lisbon', 'sisters', 'say', 'barely', 'emerge', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'know', 'Lisbons', 'know', 'clothes', 'mannerisms', 'nothing', 'more', 'tend', 'blend', 'together', 'creating', 'more', 'hollow', 'group-character', 'solid', 'individual', 'characters', 'Lux', 'played', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'fleshed', 'out', 'considerably', 'more', 'other', 'girls', 'Lack', 'characterization', 'however', 'not', '*fault*', 'Coppola', 'Rather', 'key', 'element', 'film.', 'Virgin', 'Suicides', 'narrated', 'adult', 'man', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'Lisbon', 'girls', 'neighborhood', 'adolescent', 'friends', 'watched', 'dreamed', 'lusted', 'Lisbon', 'sisters', 'afar', 'Even', 'are', 'not', 'given', 'hefty', 'screen', 'time', 'everything', 'see', 'film', 'been', 'filtered', 'eyes', 'minds', 'memories', 'neighborhood', 'boys', 'Hence', 'reason', 'never', 'really', 'get', 'know', 'girls', 'boys', 'never', 'knew', 'girls', 'Lisbons', 'were', 'simply', 'signs', 'signs', 'femininity', 'purity', 'objectivity', 'plausible', 'boys', 'did', 'make', 'attempts', 'call', 'visit', 'girls', 'never', 'really', 'even', 'wanted', 'get', 'know', 'Look', 'scene', 'Lux', 'high', 'school', 'hunk', 'Trip', 'played', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'football', 'field', 'together', 'evident', 'desire', 'arguable', 'affection', 'could', 'not', 'handle', 'coalescence', 'reality', 'Lux', 'Lisbon', 'fantasy-girl.So', 'are', 'left', 'only', 'glimpses', 'Glimpses', 'young', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'negotiate', 'societal', 'expectations', 'feminine', 'decorum', 'unreasonable', 'desires', 'male', 'peers', 'own', 'need', 'assert', 'individuality', 'are', 'truly', 'heavy', 'issues', 'almost', 'young', 'woman', 'must', 'face', 'are', 'one', 'reviewers', 'who', 'are', 'totally', 'taken', 'aback', 'sisters', 'suicides', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'be', 'thirteen', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'important', 'note', 'very', 'subtle', 'slow-moving', 'film', 'tend', 'like', 'movie', 'lot', 'dialogue', 'action', 'plot-development', 'might', 'find', 'be', 'frustrated', 'However', 'can', 'appreciate', 'brooding', 'moody', 'piece', 'art', 'then', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'Virgin', 'Suicides']",N/A

The latter is particular fodder for nepotism remarks, although it's not as if her dad has made some stellar movies lately. ""Jack"" anyone? Well this film and her next film Lost in Translation should tip the scale on her favor as she's quite perfect for this kind of material.The 5 Lisbon Sisters live extremely sheltered lives thanks to their over-protective parents, in particular their mother. After one of them commits suicide, a boy starts liking one of them prompting to bring some friends to meet the rest. An infatuation develops and pretty soon they start getting into something that when it's over, they still don't know how to make sense of it.One of the things that can sometimes happen with a film like this is that in order to explain the story, certain characters moments have to be dropped or just never filmed. While I'm certainly not faulting the film, we're never really invested enough into each girl and who they are. In fact I couldn't actually name them until someone in the film actually did. It's not that big of a knock but it's one thing I noticed.Performance-wise it's pretty solid across the board, including Kirsten Dunst and another against-type role for James Woods. Usually very manic, he's quite sedate here which is quite perfect for the dad. There's also the almost unrecognizable Kathleen Turner as the very strict mother and even a quick scene with Danny DeVito and Giovanni Ribisi as the narrator.The DVD definately needs a special edition even though what else could there be to add besides a making-of, deleted scenes and a commentary? Than again Lost in Translation seemed kinda sparse. A commentary on this disc from anyone would've been great, even Francis would've done a great one a kind of critique/overview on his daughter's first film.

The plot centers on five beautiful blonde sisters, &quot;The Lisbon Sisters,&quot; who live with their overly protective parents in an upscale suburb of Detroit. The narrative is told from the vantage point of an awkward teenage male, now grown up, who lived near them. He and his friends were mesmerized by them and years later still talk about them and sift through their memorabilia of them.The movie begins with the first two suicide attempts of the youngest sister Cecilia, with the second one being successful. It then traces the impact of her death on her family and her neighbors-with the parents becoming even more protective of their four surviving daughters. Trouble though, comes from Luz, now the youngest and the most vibrant and flirtatious. She falls for the school hunk-and he for her-and with her sisters and their escorts goes to the homecoming dance. This proves to be fatal for all involved.Sofia Coppola did an amazing job with this movie for a first time director. She focuses on small details-for example, the bracelets that cover the scarred wrists of Cecilia after her first suicide attempt-that tell so much. She pulled an outstanding performance out of Kirsten Dunst who played Luz. She also compiled an amazing soundtrack and score.I would recommend this movie for those who enjoy &quot;arty&quot; serious films, 70's films, and women-themed movies.It is definitely not a &quot;feel good&quot; movie-but it will stay with you far longer than most other films.",5,"Haunting, Harrowing &amp; Powerful",1062547200,"09 3, 2003",2003,1560,"['quot', 'Virgin', 'Suicides', 'quot', 'powerful', 'finely', 'nuanced', 'movie', 'plot', 'centers', 'five', 'beautiful', 'blonde', 'sisters', 'quot', 'Lisbon', 'Sisters', 'quot', 'who', 'live', 'overly', 'protective', 'parents', 'upscale', 'suburb', 'Detroit', 'narrative', 'told', 'vantage', 'point', 'awkward', 'teenage', 'male', 'now', 'up', 'who', 'lived', 'friends', 'were', 'mesmerized', 'years', 'later', 'still', 'talk', 'sift', 'memorabilia', 'them.The', 'movie', 'first', 'two', 'suicide', 'attempts', 'youngest', 'sister', 'Cecilia', 'second', 'one', 'being', 'successful', 'then', 'impact', 'death', 'family', 'neighbors-with', 'parents', 'becoming', 'even', 'more', 'protective', 'four', 'surviving', 'daughters', 'Trouble', 'Luz', 'now', 'youngest', 'most', 'vibrant', 'flirtatious', 'school', 'hunk-and', 'her-and', 'sisters', 'escorts', 'homecoming', 'dance', 'be', 'fatal', 'involved.Sofia', 'Coppola', 'did', 'amazing', 'job', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'director', 'small', 'details-for', 'example', 'bracelets', 'cover', 'scarred', 'wrists', 'Cecilia', 'first', 'suicide', 'attempt-that', 'tell', 'so', 'much', 'pulled', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'who', 'played', 'Luz', 'also', 'compiled', 'amazing', 'soundtrack', 'score.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'who', 'enjoy', 'quot', 'arty', 'quot', 'serious', 'films', '70', 'films', 'women-themed', 'movies.It', 'definitely', 'not', 'quot', 'feel', 'good', 'quot', 'movie-but', 'will', 'stay', 'far', 'longer', 'most', 'other', 'films']",N/A

The Virgin Suicides is captivating look into the world of a family in New England.  The family dynamic is that of an oppressive and over protective mother (Kathleen Turner) and a forgetful professer father (James Woods).  They have five beautiful daughters (Mary, Therese, Bonnie, Lux, and Cecille).  They seem like a normal happy family living on a very suburban street.  Then one day the most horrible thing happens, the youngest of their five daughters, the angelic Cecille, tries to take her own life.  The family begins questioning itself.  Cecille can't explain why she did it or what pushed her.  The family tries to put it behind them and have a party, but the party turns tragic when Cecille tries again and succeeds.  The film takes off from this moment on a journey narrated by one of the boys who fell in love with the Lisbon sisters without ever really knowing them.  The girls are allowed to go to a dance and feel normal, but when Lux, the now youngest of the sisters, doesn't come home until the next morning, the mother locks them in the house and won't let them leave even to go to school.  Their father begins to lose his mind, talking to plants and such.  Their mother turns into a lunatic blaming rock and roll albums for her misfortune.  Being locked in the house causes the girls to go a little crazy themselves.  Lux begins having nightly trysts on the roof outside of her room, and the girls begin to have private cals from the neighborhood boys where all they do is play songs for each other expressing their melancholy.  The girls figure out a way to escape and ask the boys for help.  Little do the boys know, the Lisbon sisters know of only one way to escape...  Cecilles way.  This movie will bring to light the anger, frustration, and melancholy that even the happiest of teenagers can go through.

As Sophia Coppola's brilliant debut film 'The Virgin Suicides' feels so raw, yet purposfully so, you'd swear this was far from a first feature.  The subject, as haunting as it is, is approached with such care and caution that your drawn in rather than repelled.  The film follows the Lisbon sisters as charted out in the book written by Jeffrey Eugenides which serves as the inspiration for the marvelous script.  The Lisbon sister live under the house of their overbearing parents (played brilliantly by Kathleen Turner and James Woods) and when their youngest sibling commits suicide during her birthday the parents, instead of loosening their fatal grip, pull in the reins further and set their remaining four girls on the same pathway of self destruction.  Each girl reacts to the situation differently, none with such defiance as Lux (the brilliant Kirsten Dunst who deserved an oscar nod SOOOO much for this!) who tramps around on rooftops with boy after boy, including school hunk Trip (Josh Hartnett).  As the film delicatly follows the remainder of their lives the audience is left speachless as events unfold, and the chilling conclusion is enough to silence masses.  The film is told through the eyes of the neighboring boys who worship the Lisbon girls as one worships what is unattainable (why is that) and so the film takes on that sense of wonderment in it's approach and thus leaves the audience longing for justice in these young girls lives.

524665,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00003CXH0,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[3, 3]","Having read Jeffrey Eugenides' The Virgin Suicides, easily one of the most remarkable, haunting novels ever written, I would have said it was impossible to adapt the story to film - and, to some degree, I would have been right.  Still, this film adaptation does as fine as job as is humanly possible to bring the ethereal Lisbon girls and the boys obsessed with them and their tragedy to life.  It's an excellent, convoluted movie that defies convention and embraces the mystery of the tragedy, but believe me when I say that anyone remotely interested in this movie simply must read the original novel.  This movie offers just the first taste of a surreal and tragic story that haunts the reader as much as the suicides haunt the lives of the boys still trying to understand the mystery of the Lisbon girls they adored in ways they could never have put into words.  The true magic of the story isn't the sequence of tragic events that unfold; it's the indescribable, impenetrable, unseen world the girls lived in.The novel tells the story from the outside looking in, through the eyes of the neighborhood boys who obsessed over the Lisbon girls, dreamed about them, and sought some form of access to their haunting inner world.  The girls themselves were ethereal creatures spotted only sporadically, surreal ghosts of the lively, vibrant girls they should have been.  A movie could never recreate such an abstract viewpoint - the only possible way to do it is to take us into the Lisbon house from the very start.  We see what takes places within those walls, watch the interactions of the girls with their parents and one another, and that obviously takes away from some of the mystery inherent in the novel.  Even still, we don't get to know the girls as well as we do in the novel.  Only two stand out - Constance and Lux, while the other three are simply there, impossible to call by name or recognize by individual nature.  That's the main weakness of this otherwise fine adaptation.  There's a rushed sort of feeling to the story, and we really needed more time to know and understand Bonnie, Mary, and Therese.Kirsten Dunst was a perfect choice to play the sensual free spirit that is Lux, while Hanna R. Hall is wonderful as the enigmatic Cecilia, the real lynchpin for the entire story.  The film, quickly launching into the traumatic events of the story, doesn't really give us enough time to really see who Cecilia is, and that robs it of some of its heart-touching power, I'm afraid.  James Woods plays the subdued role of Mr. Lisbon brilliantly, but Kathleen Turner just never really seemed to capture Mrs. Lisbon successfully enough for me.  Then there's Josh Hartnett - not my favorite actor - in full 70s regalia.  His character is an important link to Lux, but I think he gets too much time in the movie, to the point that it takes away from the true vision of the other boys' obsession with the girls.

You still don't know whether the movie THE VIRGIN SUICIDES is a masterpiece or the worst movie of 1999 directed by the worst director of the world. Well, it is certainly not the worst movie of the world, the co-producer Francis Ford Coppola being not a man who has the reputation to invest his money in bad movies. No, if the movie deserves the masterpiece or the triple 0 qualification , it depends only on you.Let's say that if you like Peter Weir's PICNIC AT HANGING ROCK , movies with an eerie atmosphere or european films, I'm pretty sure you will adore THE VIRGIN SUICIDES. The director Sofia Coppola, in her first movie, describes the ordinary life of an average american family with treasures of delicacy and never tries to explain why the Lisbon sisters chose to depart in such a dramatical way. She leaves hints now and then but never judges the parents of these overprotected young girls.One can recognize in THE VIRGIN SUICIDES the light influence of F. F. Coppola and his video experiments in certain scenes that remind me at times of one the masterpieces he directed : ONE FROM THE HEART. But all in all, THE VIRGIN SUICIDES is a superb first movie of a new director one will soon hear from again. The cast is also outstanding with a special word for Kathleen Turner and James Woods who impersonate the Lisbon parents in a magistral manner.The bonus features of this Paramount Classics DVD also reserve a good surprise to the movie lover. The behind the scene featurette, shot by Eleanor Coppola, is for once interesting and presents Sofia Coppola and her actors at work. You really understand that the Coppolas are a tribe who psychologically backed the director during the shooting. Other bonus features include a french dubbed version, english subtitles, the theatrical trailer and a video of the group AIR who wrote the musical score.A DVD zone your library.",5,ONE  FROM  THE  HEART,993340800,"06 24, 2001",2001,1983,"['understand', 'very', 'well', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'bit', 'confused', 'having', 'read', 'reviews', 'here', 'Amazon', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'movie', 'THE', 'VIRGIN', 'SUICIDES', 'masterpiece', 'worst', 'movie', '1999', 'directed', 'worst', 'director', 'world', 'Well', 'certainly', 'not', 'worst', 'movie', 'world', 'co-producer', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'being', 'not', 'man', 'who', 'reputation', 'invest', 'money', 'bad', 'movies', 'No', 'movie', 'masterpiece', 'triple', '0', 'qualification', 'only', 'you.Let', 'say', 'like', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'PICNIC', 'AT', 'HANGING', 'ROCK', 'movies', 'eerie', 'atmosphere', 'european', 'films', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'will', 'adore', 'THE', 'VIRGIN', 'SUICIDES', 'director', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'first', 'movie', 'ordinary', 'life', 'average', 'american', 'family', 'treasures', 'delicacy', 'never', 'tries', 'explain', 'why', 'Lisbon', 'sisters', 'chose', 'depart', 'such', 'dramatical', 'way', 'hints', 'now', 'then', 'never', 'judges', 'parents', 'overprotected', 'young', 'girls.One', 'can', 'recognize', 'THE', 'VIRGIN', 'SUICIDES', 'light', 'influence', 'F.', 'F.', 'Coppola', 'video', 'experiments', 'certain', 'scenes', 'remind', 'times', 'one', 'masterpieces', 'directed', 'ONE', 'THE', 'HEART', 'THE', 'VIRGIN', 'SUICIDES', 'superb', 'first', 'movie', 'new', 'director', 'one', 'will', 'soon', 'hear', 'again', 'cast', 'also', 'outstanding', 'special', 'word', 'Kathleen', 'Turner', 'James', 'Woods', 'who', 'impersonate', 'Lisbon', 'parents', 'magistral', 'manner.The', 'bonus', 'features', 'Paramount', 'Classics', 'DVD', 'also', 'reserve', 'good', 'surprise', 'movie', 'lover', 'scene', 'featurette', 'shot', 'Eleanor', 'Coppola', 'once', 'interesting', 'presents', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'actors', 'work', 'really', 'understand', 'Coppolas', 'are', 'tribe', 'who', 'psychologically', 'backed', 'director', 'shooting', 'Other', 'bonus', 'features', 'include', 'french', 'dubbed', 'version', 'english', 'subtitles', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'video', 'group', 'AIR', 'who', 'wrote', 'musical', 'score.A', 'DVD', 'zone', 'library']",N/A

The Lisbon family, consisting of extremely oppressive parents- the mother more so than the father (portrayed wonderfully by Kathleen Turner and James Woods) and five beautiful teenage daughters, is the central focus of the film.  Within the first 10 minutes of the film, the youngest daughter commits suicide.  From there you view a steady decline leading up to the inevitable &quot;Virgin Suicides&quot; of the remaining four daughters.The girls were mainly portrayed from the eyes of four boys from their neighborhood.  The boys were fascinated with the girls- an adolescant obsession.  The film actually starts from one of the boys as an adult lamenting back on the girls &quot;he could never forget&quot;. (With due reason!)The cast was phenomenal.  Kirsten Dunst really shines as do James Woods and Kathleen Turner.  But they were not used to thier full potential.  You never really get to know the characters.  All you see are small glimpses. The character development from the beginning could have absolutely been better. The movie does not answer any questions of why the girls committed suicide.  I understand, the films sole premise was not  was not meant to be about the suicides, but with such a tragedy that occured I felt a core part of the story development was ignored. At the end of the movie, you are not truly sad for the catastrophic mass suicide, or for the parents, as you barely get to know them.

I've see some reviews that imply this is a movie bashing religion -  we can assume that religion plays a role in their lives.  Their priest does makes an appearance or two in their home.  Religious images do hang on doors and walls here and there.  However it doesn't seem the priest was invited, he just kind of shows up to check on them and no one seems very interested in his presence.  Aside from saying grace at the dinner table, there's little talk of religion.  There's no religious extremist 24/7 religion religion religion stuff that I almost expected given some of the reviews I read.  No, this is not that.Instead this is a family of girls.  We see hints that the father wants them to shine, to be like other girls.  The mother, however, sees how the boys are starting to look at them.  She's already lost one girl.  She caves once and lets them go out (together, where daddy will be).  It goes okay, mostly - except the one girl who doesn't show up at home on time (we're talking next day late).  Can't risk losing another girl, so lockdown it is.  No school.  No records.  No nothin',The boys on their street haven't forgotten them though.  They watch them.  Spy really.  Stalk?  And they try to get anything of theirs they can, to piece together their lives.  To see what is becoming of the girls - especially important to the boys after the girls have  died.  They need to know who they really were.  Why each and every one of them suicided.  Why they are all gone.  It's not like they weren't all loved by all of the boys.The only people in this movie who seem to understand anything about the world are the ones who seem to acknowledge they don't understand much - the aforementioned boys.  The adults use the death of the girls as gossip fodder or at their worst as joke material.  The older teen boys use the girls as conquests.  The girls (both the suicided ones and the those left behind in their town) don't seem to understand anything but how to self-destruct (you can see it in their eyes they say).",5,The boys understood the world better than they gave themselves credit for...,1300924800,"03 24, 2011",2011,2161,"['When', 'one', 'girl', 'family', 'girls', 'commits', 'suicide', 'parents', 'decide', 'way', 'protect', 'others', 'become', 'just', 'wee', 'bit', 'strict', ""'ve"", 'see', 'reviews', 'imply', 'movie', 'bashing', 'religion', 'can', 'assume', 'religion', 'role', 'lives', 'priest', 'appearance', 'two', 'home', 'Religious', 'images', 'do', 'hang', 'doors', 'walls', 'here', 'there', 'However', ""n't"", 'seem', 'priest', 'was', 'invited', 'just', 'kind', 'shows', 'check', 'one', 'very', 'interested', 'presence', 'Aside', 'saying', 'grace', 'dinner', 'table', 'little', 'talk', 'religion', 'religious', 'extremist', '24/7', 'religion', 'religion', 'religion', 'stuff', 'almost', 'expected', 'given', 'reviews', 'read', 'No', 'not', 'that.Instead', 'family', 'girls', 'see', 'hints', 'father', 'shine', 'be', 'other', 'girls', 'mother', 'however', 'how', 'boys', 'are', 'starting', 'look', 'already', 'lost', 'one', 'girl', 'once', 'lets', 'go', 'out', 'together', 'where', 'daddy', 'will', 'be', 'okay', 'mostly', 'one', 'girl', 'who', ""n't"", 'show', 'up', 'home', 'time', ""'re"", 'talking', 'next', 'day', 'late', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'risk', 'losing', 'girl', 'so', 'lockdown', 'school', 'records', 'nothin', 'boys', 'street', 'have', ""n't"", 'forgotten', 'watch', 'Spy', 'really', 'Stalk', 'try', 'get', 'anything', 'can', 'piece', 'together', 'lives', 'see', 'what', 'becoming', 'girls', 'especially', 'important', 'boys', 'girls', 'have', 'died', 'need', 'know', 'who', 'really', 'were', 'Why', 'one', 'suicided', 'Why', 'are', 'gone', 'not', 'were', ""n't"", 'all', 'loved', 'boys.The', 'only', 'people', 'movie', 'who', 'seem', 'understand', 'anything', 'world', 'are', 'ones', 'who', 'seem', 'acknowledge', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'much', 'aforementioned', 'boys', 'adults', 'use', 'death', 'girls', 'gossip', 'fodder', 'worst', 'joke', 'material', 'older', 'teen', 'boys', 'use', 'girls', 'conquests', 'girls', 'suicided', 'ones', 'left', 'town', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'understand', 'anything', 'how', 'self-destruct', 'can', 'see', 'eyes', 'say']",N/A

Superficially it's a teen angst story featuring the usual dysfunctional parents, idiot school teachers, prom night hijinks, first love, and the inevitable loss of innocence.  But on a deeper level this film is a variation on such films, done in an artistic manner and told from an unlikely point of view.Consider that the story focuses on five teenaged girls who committed suicide.  Yet their story is seen from the point of view of the high school boys who adored the girls, boys who seem curiously younger than the girls (as in reality most boys are relative to girls of the same age).  There is one exception and that is Trip Fontaine played by Josh Hartnett.  He is big and handsome and worldly wise (for his age).  He is charming and adored by just about everyone, especially by all the girls in the school.  But his desire is directed toward Lux Lisbon, the oldest of the ill-fated Lisbon sisters.  Initially she doesn't seem interested in him, but that only serves to whet his appetite, and then...  Well, let's just say that players only love you when they're playing--or something like that.The tragedy seems a bit effete in the telling.  The suicides seem excessive and monstrously headstrong.  Mom and Dad, you WILL pay for this!  There's the overbearing and dictatorial mother who cares only about appearances, played menacingly by Kathleen Turner.  James Woods serves as both the father of the girls and as a somewhat spacey math teacher who seems to have no idea that he and his wife are suffocating their children.  Kirsten Dunst is the enigmatic Lux who dies more from a broken heart than from the fumes of exhaust.In the end the boys are left wondering what happened and why and what they could have done differently.  But life in the upper middle class suburban town goes on.  An older Trip Fontaine is interviewed as in a documentary.  He more or less shrugs his shoulders.  TV reporters mouth cliches.  Neighbors play golf and flirt and drink excessively.  The boys grow older but no wiser.  The elms are cut down, the house is sold, and again life goes on and on and yet there is no answer, no justification, no meaning to the tragedy of five girls who snuffed out their lives for...what?Bottom line: interesting and original but strangely artificial as though the girls were Barbie dolls briefly brought to life and then put back into their boxes.",4,A strange and original teen angst film,1136851200,"01 10, 2006",2006,2437,"['was', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'first', 'film', 'interesting', 'one', 'Superficially', 'teen', 'angst', 'story', 'featuring', 'usual', 'dysfunctional', 'parents', 'idiot', 'school', 'teachers', 'prom', 'night', 'hijinks', 'first', 'love', 'inevitable', 'loss', 'innocence', 'deeper', 'level', 'film', 'variation', 'such', 'films', 'done', 'artistic', 'manner', 'told', 'unlikely', 'point', 'view.Consider', 'story', 'five', 'teenaged', 'girls', 'who', 'committed', 'suicide', 'story', 'seen', 'point', 'view', 'high', 'school', 'boys', 'who', 'adored', 'girls', 'boys', 'who', 'seem', 'curiously', 'younger', 'girls', 'reality', 'most', 'boys', 'are', 'relative', 'girls', 'same', 'age', 'one', 'exception', 'Trip', 'Fontaine', 'played', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'big', 'handsome', 'worldly', 'wise', 'age', 'charming', 'adored', 'just', 'everyone', 'especially', 'girls', 'school', 'desire', 'directed', 'Lux', 'Lisbon', 'oldest', 'ill-fated', 'Lisbon', 'sisters', 'Initially', ""n't"", 'seem', 'interested', 'only', 'whet', 'appetite', 'then', 'Well', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'players', 'only', 'love', 'when', ""'re"", 'playing', 'something', 'that.The', 'tragedy', 'bit', 'effete', 'telling', 'suicides', 'seem', 'excessive', 'monstrously', 'headstrong', 'Mom', 'Dad', 'WILL', 'pay', 'overbearing', 'dictatorial', 'mother', 'who', 'only', 'about', 'appearances', 'played', 'menacingly', 'Kathleen', 'Turner', 'James', 'Woods', 'father', 'girls', 'somewhat', 'spacey', 'math', 'teacher', 'who', 'have', 'idea', 'wife', 'are', 'suffocating', 'children', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'enigmatic', 'Lux', 'who', 'more', 'broken', 'heart', 'fumes', 'exhaust.In', 'end', 'boys', 'are', 'left', 'wondering', 'what', 'happened', 'why', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'differently', 'life', 'upper', 'middle', 'class', 'suburban', 'town', 'older', 'Trip', 'Fontaine', 'interviewed', 'documentary', 'more', 'less', 'shrugs', 'shoulders', 'TV', 'reporters', 'mouth', 'cliches', 'Neighbors', 'play', 'golf', 'flirt', 'drink', 'excessively', 'boys', 'grow', 'older', 'wiser', 'elms', 'are', 'cut', 'down', 'house', 'sold', 'again', 'life', 'yet', 'answer', 'justification', 'meaning', 'tragedy', 'five', 'girls', 'who', 'snuffed', 'out', 'lives', 'what', 'Bottom', 'line', 'interesting', 'original', 'strangely', 'artificial', 'girls', 'were', 'Barbie', 'dolls', 'briefly', 'brought', 'life', 'then', 'put', 'back', 'boxes']",N/A

To tell you the honest truth, the movie is actually better than the book.  When Coppola wrote the screenplay for this movie, most of the time, she quoted the dialogue and the narrator's comments verbatim from the book.  If you hated or disliked the movie for some reason, blame the author of the book-Jeffery Eugenides-because Coppola followed the book faithfully.  One reviewer complained that we never really understand why the girls committed suicide and we never really get to know the characters of the parents and the Lisbon girls.  Let me tell you, the book definitely does not address these aspects very well at all.  In fact, I would say that it is this lack of knowledge, on the part of the narrators, in regards to the Lisbon family, which keeps their obsession with the girls going.  The narrator tells us that even as adults, he and his friends keep going over the evidence trying to put it all together and figure out, for certain, what happened and why in regards to the Lisbon girls.  In my opinion, Coppolla actually did a better job of characterizing the Lisbon family than Eugenides did.It may sound like I did not like the book, but this is not true.  What I am really saying is that Coppola took a good book and made a good movie that was a very faithful representation of the book it was based on.Obviously the suicides of the five Lisbon girls are tragic, but what I find to be the biggest tragedy, in this movie/book, is that these adult men have let their childhood crushes and fantasies about these girls ruin their chance of ever finding happiness and fulfillment in their relationships with other women.

524678,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B00003CXH0,Doug Anderson,"[3, 4]","Virgin Suicides is about the disparity that exists between life as it is dreamed and life as it is lived. And, by extension, about the disparity between art and life.The Lisbon sisters are exiled from the rest of the neighborhood; this exile is, in part, imposed on them by ultra-conservative parents who seem intent on sheltering their girls from the other sex, but the exile also seems self-imposed as the sisters are each exceptionally gorgeous and imaginative and live in a closed world of their own making, as if they have already decided that nothing in actual life will ever match their dream of life.However, this is all just hearsay because the entire story is told in flashback by a group of neighborhood boys and all information about the girls that we have comes to us through the filter of boyhhood fantasy and/or adult male regret.  The boys want to envision themselves as the girls liberators but, in reality, nothing they do opens up any kind of communication; the only common language they have is the inarticulate speech of emotion that is music. Boy-girl relations have never seemed so dysfuntional as they do in this film; both sexes seem willing but neither seem able to negotiate the gender gap. Since the girls' actual reality cannot be known and since reality itself is difficult and confusing and unmanagable the boys construct fictions about the girls and about themselves and this gives them at least a momentary sense of control over their own confused discourses and destinies but the girls' absence never stops haunting male discourses and destinies.Thus the film is about the boys as much as it is about the girls. And the film examines both sexes penchant for fantasy. Ultimately, this habit of mind is destructive: the overly-imaginative boys never develop emotionally and never have any ""real"" relationship with the girls; and the overly imaginative girls, disappointed with reality, refuse life altogether (or at least this is the fiction the boys construct). Its a complex film as it examines boy/girl relationships/realities and how each gender/sex constructs the other in a mutually disempowering and disabling way.The film can be read as an examination of ""gender"" as a culturally produced fiction. But, more generally, the film can be read as an examination of the cultural emptiness that afflicts both sexes and makes both sexes prefer fantasy and fiction to reality. Throughout Virgin Suicides there is a feeling that American life in the affluent suburbs of the seventies is a meaningless drift and the only response to such emptiness is to retreat within and filter everything through fantasy.Coppola's later film, Lost in Translation, further develops this theme of youth as a disaffected dream state and adulthood as a fully disillusioned state. And Marie Antoinette explores disaffection/alienation as a result of class constructs as well as gender constructs. The success of the films hinge on Coppola's ability to visualize inner landscapes as well as her ability to find a variety of visualy compelling ways to convey an overall sense of drifting from one largely inarticulate state of mind, or time of life, to another. Coppola seems to distrust conventional narratives and since she does not anchor her stories in traditional narrative structures her characters do not feel anchored in tradition, rather they seem to refuse it, and this serves to give her films an avant-garde edge that appeals to others who find traditional storytelling confining and unfulfilling.",4,youthful disaffection narratively deconstructed,1165622400,"12 9, 2006",2006,3518,"['Virgin', 'Suicides', 'disparity', 'life', 'dreamed', 'life', 'lived', 'extension', 'disparity', 'art', 'life.The', 'Lisbon', 'sisters', 'are', 'exiled', 'rest', 'neighborhood', 'exile', 'part', 'imposed', 'ultra-conservative', 'parents', 'who', 'seem', 'intent', 'sheltering', 'girls', 'other', 'sex', 'exile', 'also', 'self-imposed', 'sisters', 'are', 'exceptionally', 'gorgeous', 'imaginative', 'live', 'closed', 'world', 'own', 'making', 'have', 'already', 'decided', 'nothing', 'actual', 'life', 'will', 'ever', 'match', 'dream', 'life.However', 'just', 'hearsay', 'entire', 'story', 'told', 'flashback', 'group', 'neighborhood', 'boys', 'information', 'girls', 'have', 'filter', 'boyhhood', 'fantasy', 'adult', 'male', 'regret', 'boys', 'want', 'envision', 'girls', 'liberators', 'reality', 'nothing', 'do', 'up', 'kind', 'communication', 'only', 'common', 'language', 'have', 'inarticulate', 'speech', 'emotion', 'music', 'Boy-girl', 'relations', 'have', 'never', 'seemed', 'so', 'dysfuntional', 'do', 'film', 'sexes', 'seem', 'willing', 'seem', 'able', 'negotiate', 'gender', 'gap', 'girls', 'actual', 'reality', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'known', 'reality', 'difficult', 'confusing', 'unmanagable', 'boys', 'construct', 'fictions', 'girls', 'least', 'momentary', 'sense', 'control', 'own', 'confused', 'discourses', 'destinies', 'girls', 'absence', 'never', 'haunting', 'male', 'discourses', 'destinies.Thus', 'film', 'boys', 'as', 'much', 'girls', 'film', 'sexes', 'penchant', 'fantasy', 'Ultimately', 'habit', 'mind', 'destructive', 'overly-imaginative', 'boys', 'never', 'develop', 'emotionally', 'never', 'have', 'real', 'relationship', 'girls', 'overly', 'imaginative', 'girls', 'disappointed', 'reality', 'refuse', 'life', 'altogether', 'least', 'fiction', 'boys', 'construct', 'complex', 'film', 'boy/girl', 'relationships/realities', 'how', 'gender/sex', 'other', 'mutually', 'disempowering', 'disabling', 'way.The', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'read', 'examination', 'gender', 'culturally', 'produced', 'fiction', 'more', 'generally', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'read', 'examination', 'cultural', 'emptiness', 'sexes', 'sexes', 'prefer', 'fantasy', 'fiction', 'reality', 'Virgin', 'Suicides', 'feeling', 'American', 'life', 'affluent', 'suburbs', 'seventies', 'meaningless', 'drift', 'only', 'response', 'such', 'emptiness', 'retreat', 'filter', 'everything', 'fantasy.Coppola', 'later', 'film', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'further', 'theme', 'youth', 'disaffected', 'dream', 'state', 'adulthood', 'fully', 'disillusioned', 'state', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'disaffection/alienation', 'result', 'class', 'constructs', 'as', 'well', 'gender', 'constructs', 'success', 'films', 'hinge', 'Coppola', 'ability', 'visualize', 'inner', 'landscapes', 'as', 'well', 'ability', 'find', 'variety', 'visualy', 'compelling', 'ways', 'convey', 'overall', 'sense', 'drifting', 'one', 'largely', 'inarticulate', 'state', 'mind', 'time', 'life', 'Coppola', 'distrust', 'conventional', 'narratives', 'not', 'anchor', 'stories', 'traditional', 'narrative', 'structures', 'characters', 'do', 'not', 'feel', 'anchored', 'tradition', 'rather', 'seem', 'refuse', 'give', 'films', 'avant-garde', 'edge', 'appeals', 'others', 'who', 'find', 'traditional', 'storytelling', 'confining', 'unfulfilling']",N/A

And how you ended up knowing what colors went together ...... our job was to create the noise that seemed to fascinate them.""These are the words of the film's ""want-to-be heroes"" or, perhaps more accurately, endearing voyeurs: a small group of awestruck boys. The film is narrated (by the compelling voice of Giovanni Ribisi) in the present. The narrator was a part of this collection and we learn about the Lisbon sisters through him. Though still enamored with the Lisbon sisters (""The only way we could feel close to the girls was through these impossible trips which have scarred us forever, making us happier with dreams than wives""), the narrator's recount is as frank as it is heart-breaking.In contrast to these young men, Coppola shows us a litany of salacious adolescent-men desperate to take advantage of these shelter girls/women: in particular, Trip Fontaine (played in youth by Josh Hartnett). His present day recount of Lux (Dunst) is repellent ... his claims of love belie the truth. The only comfort we glean is that present-day Trip, once the heart-throb of girls and mothers, has aged badly (dirty, unshaven, unkempt etc) and is in a treatment facility. Still, it seems ""not enough."" Nonetheless, through this comparison, we see both the kindheartedness of the first group of boys (even though they sexualize the Lisbon sisters, they care for them) versus the heartlessness of another. Balance resides in Coppola's work.Though set in the 70's, Coppola's work tackles a number of still pertinent issues. It underscores the callousness of the news-media, as well as its tendency to promote generalizations. Watching the media's reaction to Cecilia's death (this is not a spoiler ... the film's first line is ""Cecilia was the first to go"") and its impact on schools/parents reminds the viewer of Michael Lehmann'sHeathers(""Suicide, Don't Do It!""). Likewise, Coppola's work shows us the results of parental oppression ...  Mrs. Lisbon (Kathleen Turner) suffocates her children in her outmoded morality. The results ... well, it's all in the film title. Sympathy is garnered for Mr. Lisbon (beautiful played by James Woods). He has little power over his restrictive wife; still, he tries to gain liberties for his daughters. His love for his children, his desire for them to be normal, crushes our hearts.Edward Lachman's cinematography is gorgeous. Watch for pale pink and blue lighting in the Lisbon sisters' room. Lachman explains that he used it to underscore the innocence of the sisters. Likewise, the use of toxic-green at the asphyxiation-party is effective and appropriate (watch for green desserts, drinks, gas-masks etc...) It emphasizes not only the literal poison but the toxic-ignorance of the adults (who gossip, who mock the girls, who feign suicide at this party.) (For more on color in film, see Patti Bellantoni'sIf It's Purple, Someone's Gonna Die: The Power of Color in Visual Storytelling). Brilliantly crafted. The film also boasts a beautiful use of split-screen (so rarely done well) toward its conclusion (during the scene where the boys play records over the phone).Coppola's work is a must-see for anyone interested in coming-of-age films, indie film, or the lives of women.Suggested reading:Eugenides, Jeffrey.Virgin suicides.

524683,A1WTAR27Z4JIA1,B00003CXH0,D. Walker,"[6, 7]","I'm probably giving nothing away by calling this film a ""mood piece,"" with no real characters or story. It seems to be about a certain, universal quality of memory. If it went into specifics (such as motivation), the bubble would burst. Anyone who's seen the trailers can sort of guess it's a wet-dream reminiscence. Children have trouble with empathy and can't read anybody, particularly the opposite sex, so it makes sense that the narrator has no insights into what is going on, even from the distance of twenty years. And maybe he doesn't want any: the time-mellowed haze of his voyeuristic memories is too exciting for him to willfully complicate.And the viewer? You'll probably have mixed feelings. For one thing, the redundant narration (mumbled by half-awake Giovanni Ribisi) punctures the delicate mood. Yes, we guessed already that he's ""haunted"" by these Lisbon sisters, that they embodied le mystique feminine, a je ne sais blah blah blah... His jarring, jaded voice-over banalizes the film's brilliance at every turn.I hated this ""literary"" narration so much that I made a note to avoid the novel at all costs. Interestingly, the author, Jeffrey Eugenides, appears in the featurette on the DVD, and he's surprisingly inarticulate. He is also (unsurprisingly) rather nebbishy, and seems painfully out of place on the set, among vibrant young people (the cast and director) who are still looking forward to life. The novel is the only one he has written, which makes me think that his own sun set long ago, circa 1976. There's amusing footage of a forced conversation between him and callow Josh Hartnett, trapped together in a pair of folding chairs between takes; it's a classic cool guy/nerd encounter, full of fidgety pauses (""Um, so...I read your novel, man. Really loved it""...)The real surprise here is Sofia Coppola; her direction, not to mention her ability to elicit perfect performances from a young cast, are phenomenal. At its best, her film is sort of a visualization of Keats' ""Ode on a Grecian Urn"" (""Who are these coming to the sacrifice?..."") If you don't know the poem, read it!No wonder Kirsten Dunst can refer to Sofia (who also wrote the screenplay) as the material's ""source,"" completely ignoring the novel. (I'm guessing the girls were kept far away from sweaty Eugenides). In Sofia's hands, the ""trivial, mundane details"" of the Lisbon girls' lives are the texture and soul of the film. All of these are handled just right, vivid and period-perfect yet ethereal, timeless: the jewel-like vials of seventies lip-gloss, the kitschy way the girls write their names, the songs, the spangled balloons at the prom. It's all surface, and all she's given to work with, yet she takes the proverbial sow's ear and a clammy whiff of adolescent sex/death fantasy and weaves them into a sort of tightrope to lift us somewhere, between dreaminess and darkness, for two hours. Only in recollection does it all fall apart.The whole ""story"" is just an elegy for a golden age of male libido and ignorance. These girls exist only to be watched; their mystery is shallowly contrived. Though they're all stunners--immaculately groomed, personally charming--none of them has any friends. That might tarnish their mystique. They float dreamily around campus, a sort of unbreachable blonde coven, showing no emotion, no thoughts, not even a pang of sibling enmity. During the months they are (implausibly) under house arrest, they all huddle together in a bedroom, grooming each other fatalistically. No squabbles, no fights. No one broods apart from the rest, except for Lux, who somehow lures strange men into sexual trysts on the roof (you'd think her control-freak parents would notice the guys scaling the house at all hours)... In short, everything they do--including, of course, their final act--is staged for the titillation/mystification of bland little boys, who have nothing better to do all day than obsess on impassive chicks. Whatever.Maybe I should disclose my complicated feelings about this film. (If personal notes offend you, stop reading). That song ""Magic Man"" wrenched me back 25 years, to the summer of '76, when it was a favorite song of the four blonde sisters who lived next door. They were a lot like the Lisbons: all beautiful in their different ways, all a bit strange (or so they seemed then), all herded off to church several times a week by right-wing parents. The difference is that one of them (Laurie, the second youngest) was my closest friend for five years, so I was able to see the family from the inside. On the surface, and in public, these girls were so serene; privately, they all seemed ready to implode.One summer, Laurie taught me a particularly foul word, which I made the mistake of repeating later that day in a car packed with all four of them. The three oldest flew into a sort of Bacchic frenzy, grabbing at me wildly, swatting me with their hair, choking me, each of them wrenching my face up to meet her angry blue eyes to be sure I felt her full outrage. For long afterward, this was one of my more delicious memories.Best not to tell more--such as what became of them. Just that I understand on some level why Eugenides needed to cut the Lisbons off at the height of their powers; to seal them forever in an amber of promise and mystery. To the grown narrator, they're still virgins in a bower (even Lux), unpenetrated by the wisdom of age. It may be a con, but it's an attractive one. I've watched this movie three times. If I ever need to see it a fourth time, maybe I'll add another star.",3,Sphinx without a Secret,1053216000,"05 18, 2003",2003,5559,"[""'m"", 'probably', 'giving', 'nothing', 'away', 'calling', 'film',

I was not.  Here's the movie in a nutshell (mild spoilers):Gauzy shots of striking blonde girls in 70's garb.  They're very mysterious.  The neighborhood boys are obsessed with these mysterious girls, who are sheltered by their overprotective parents.  One of the girls, played by Kirsten Dunst, exhibits some personality and takes up with a young rogue played by Josh Hartnett.  Besides the cool soundtrack, Hartnett is the only memorable part of the movie.  The overprotective mother overreacts.  The sisters remain mysterious.  And so on.At least with Sofia Coppola's second movie ""Lost in Translation"", there are a couple of fleshed-out characters and sort-of a plot to go along with the mood.  In ""Virgin Suicides"", a pervasive atmosphere is established by long shots in soft lighting and wistful music, but there is very little else to chew on.  I waited the whole movie for something interesting to happen.  Some reviewers wrote that the movie isn't about the girls at all, but the boys' obsession with them and their lust for the unattainable, but the boys are also very loosely drawn.  They're fascinated, and we're supposed to be too, but the girls have to BE fascinating -- it's not enough to just repeat that they're mysterious and keep showing them in slow takes.I didn't even need an explanation or a tidy wrap-up -- if I see a movie like ""Mulholland Drive"", a film which also relies a lot on atmosphere and doesn't explain itself, I can at least walk out knowing I saw something interesting and perhaps profound.

Knowing very little about the book that it was based on, other than it was a book, I had no real expectations.  I didn't have some doubts about Sofia Coppela pulling of a film of her own, but it shows that her dad has raised another great director.  One reviewer on this site seems very unhappy that she Sofia Coppela was given a &quot;pampered&quot; life and had this movie handed to her.  Well....good!  She made a great film.  And her casting could not have been better done.  James Woods (True Believer, Vampires) gives an incredible, Oscar worthy performance as the father.  Kathleen Turner (Romancing the Stone, Body Heat) is incredible as the no-makeup, insane mother.  These two actors really set the tone for the film and make it what it is.Kirstin Dunst (Interview with the Vampire, Bring It On) seems to have been a more obvious choice for Lux.  She plays the sexy sister with the most lines.  With all the teen movies she is in right now, there is no doubt this was a rare chance for her to show of some real skill and she did.This is a great film.  Very much worth the time and money to check out.  As for Sofia Coppela being &quot;pampered&quot;, who cares!  Being the daughter of a great director is no differnt then being the daughter of a great chief, anything she does will probably be pretty good and she may in fact end up better than her father.

524687,A2WELXI7RO4R2D,B00003CXH0,Egoman,"[7, 9]","As far as I can tell, this film was trying to explore a few different themes:-the dream-like quality of memory-the adolescent mindset, especially toward sex-and innocence vs. over-protectivenessIn the first case, Coppolla does an excellent job with her lighting effects (hazy, washed-out scenery) and dialogue (understated and, often, unrealistic) of portraying memory.  The film seems distant and surreal, just as, perhaps, are your own memories of adolescence.In the second case, however, I think ""The Virgin Suicides"" drops the ball.  We never really learn anything about any of the characters.  For the girls, there is an excuse- this is the boys' memory.  But what about the boys themselves?  They aren't particularly developed as characters, which would be fine, if they were at least a little sympathetic.  Actually, I found myself put off by their warped fascination with the Lisbon sisters.  This was the kind of obsession they really needed to see a psychiatrist about (although perhaps I'm not the best judge, since I didn't find the Lisbons appealing, and I've never considered Kirsten Dunst to be particularly attractive).I also felt the third theme was fairly weak.  The parents were so over-the-top (especially the mother) that I couldn't sympathize with them at all, while the girls were such blank slates that I had nothing to try to sympathize with.  When the first daughter killed herself, I couldn't figure it out.  I wasn't even sure if Coppolla was trying to make some kind of black joke.  After all, there was really no reason for it- it was just such an overreaction.  Because I didn't know why she'd done it, and the evidence I had made it look like she was simply being petty, I actually didn't feel sorry for her at all.Needless to say, I couldn't figure out a reason for any of the other girls to kill themselves either.  I realize that this is the boys' memory, and they wouldn't have known the reasons, but I can't even imagine a (reasonable) possibility that could have driven them to suicide.The performances of James Woods and Kathleen Turner as the parents are outstanding, but the rest seem fairly lackluster.  Part of that is the material, but part is just a lack of talent and/or effort.In sum, this would have made an excellent 10-minute short, but as a feature it loses its way.

IF you have a true open mind for film, and want to see something different, this may be the movie for you.  It is the writing and directing debut of Sofia Coppola, daughter of Francis Ford Coppola.  I thought she did an excellent job considering this was her first film.I watched this film, not aware that it was adapted from a novel.  Usually I think reading the book first really helps in understand more about the movie, but from what I've read about this particular book is that it doesn't help to understand the movie any better.IT is sort of reminicsient of another book adapted into film - American Psycho.  Certainly this is an altogether different film, but the idea of the surreal quality to it and the fact that questions are unanswered throughout both the book and the film make them somewhat similar.I think that Kristen Dunst really has a great career ahead of her as a serious actress, to think that was the same little girl from &quot;Interview with a Vampire&quot;..she has come a long way in the roles she plays, and she doesn't always play the same character, which must be hard considering her age.  She was brilliant as the sex-starved sister, Lux Lisbon.The story is about sisters that are very close and being raised very strictly by Kathleen Turner, looking like she really got into the character, and James Woods.  What a change for both of them!  They seemed to have been typecast for a long time but with these two roles, they have really broken through as actors.  When the youngest sister commits suicide is when the film really starts to get seriously disturbing, yet I was still absorbed. Absorped by the acting, the music, the times, and the story itself.  It is narrated by Giovanni Ribisi, who is portrayed in the film as one of the four younger boys who become obsessed with the Lisbon sisters and their lives, or nonexistent lives. I think the parents have a lot to do with what takes place in this film.  This is hardly the feel good film of 2000, but it was very interesting and entertaining, if you have a broad mind.

Then again what is absurd, and what is unimaginable? In a world with six billion plus, anything and everything is possible. The film lingered with me for hours after seeing it, I didn't want it too end almost, I wanted to know the girls more, and yet I couldn't, they were lifeless, and that is the pure remarkability of Coppola to bring us into a world so perverse that we only want to be on the outside window shopping, and see that even in the most glorious of beauty, lies the complex intricies of abnormaility. It's a sick film, a funny film, it reminds me sort of in a way to Almost Famous. I can't really say why, but it seems to share some sort of tangible relevance to actually care whats going on in each moment of the film.The Virgin Suicides has a killer soundtrack, Air is breathtaking in key scences that surely needed it and the stereotypical role of the jock using the girl for as long as he could to just make it around home plate, is a sure kick in Jonny Football hero's keester, as its spot on.I recommed this for people who want something entirely different, and James Woods of course handles it yet again, and gracefully shows us what acting is beyond reciting lines, its living a part, and he does it deliciously so.

Sophia Coppola directs this slow moving film that is a cross between ""The Wonder Years"" and ""Inventing the Abbots"" only with a tragic twist.It is the story about five attractive teenage sisters with an oppressive mother (Kathleen Turner), whose over protectiveness drives them all to tragic ends.  Along the way, we have a typical coming of age story with awkward teenagers obsessing over members of the opposite sex despite their parents' misgivings.Though charming at times, the story really doesn't offer a fresh perspective on anything but the suicide angle, and that lacks basis.  Coppola, who also wrote the screenplay based on a novel by Jeffrey Eugenides, is so focused on the coming of age aspect that she completely neglects the motivational foundation for the suicides.  Other than Lux (Kirsten Dunst), we get zero character development of the rest of the sisters.  They all seem to be normal, well-adjusted teens, and then one day they self-destruct.Perhaps the message is supposed to be that suicide can happen to anyone without warning, but that is not how it really happens.  Usually, there are warning signs that are being ignored.  We should have seen hints of such problems with each of the girls.  Instead, we see four of the sisters whose characters are totally undeveloped and who, in the end, turn out to be little more than anonymous body count. In this regard, the film lacks subtlety and depth.To Coppola's credit, the photography was beautifully done and the seventies were well captured.  The teen scenes were done sensitively and realistically, with coy enticements by the girls and false bravado by the boys.  However, the pace was wormlike.  When the film was finished, I was sure it was over two hours, when in fact it was just 90 minutes.The acting was generally good by the teens.  Kirsten Dunst was marvelous as Lux, the coquettish daughter who routinely invites boys for sexual adventures on the roof of her house.  Josh Hartnett also gives a terrific performance as Lux's first love interest.  Kathleen Turner's character was more a looming presence than a dynamic force, but she portrayed the character well.  James Woods was fabulous as her obsequious husband, the nerdy math professor who tried to convince his wife to let the girls have a little fun.This film had much greater potential than was realized.  I can't agree with all the rave reviews.  Sophia Coppola did a good job for a directorial debut, especially with the photography, but made some rookie mistakes in pacing and foundation that diminished the film.

This is a well-crafted story about the coming of adulthood and the power of (lost) dreams, one that wisely covers key issues like the loss of innocence, love and freedom.The five Lisbon sisters truly carry an ethereal, dream-like mood, an element that Coppola manages to deliver throughout the entire movie, which is as beautiful as it is haunting. One can sense a gripping and enigmatic atmosphere here, that combined with the slow development of the plot creates an hypnotic and addictive cinematic experience with an unique feel.The soundtrack, mostly by the french duo Air, also carries that strange yet captivating feel, offering the perfect musical combination to the unsettling images.We never really know why the sisters killed themselves, although some hints are given through the movie. They really didn`t seem to connect with their envoironment, partially because of their parents` attitude but also due to the adolescence period they had started to experience. They saw the world in a peculiar way, discovering mysteries and elements no one else noticed.The effects of isolation and lack of communication are well handled here, especially in one of the last scenes where the girls play music on the phone to their neighbours. This is indeed an excellent and very well-observed coming-of-age moment, a truly memmorable sequence.Although it carries some unengaging scenes and has characters that the viewer isn`t allowed to know or connect with, &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot; is still a fine effort and a worthwile indie movie about troubled and confused teenagers. It`s also another sucessful film that dares to explore the &quot;peaceful&quot; and &quot;calm&quot; american suburbia where apparently there`s not much going on.Recommended.",3,Teen Dream,1078790400,"03 9, 2004",2004,1920,"['One', 'most', 'intriguing', 'subtle', 'teen', 'movies', 'last', 'years', 'quot', 'Virgin', 'Suicides', 'quot', 'interesting', 'promising', 'debut', 'director', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'well-crafted', 'story', 'coming', 'adulthood', 'power', 'lost', 'dreams', 'one', 'wisely', 'key', 'issues', 'loss', 'innocence', 'love', 'freedom.The', 'five', 'Lisbon', 'sisters', 'truly', 'carry', 'ethereal', 'dream-like', 'mood', 'element', 'Coppola', 'deliver', 'entire', 'movie', 'as', 'beautiful', 'haunting', 'One', 'can', 'sense', 'gripping', 'enigmatic', 'atmosphere', 'here', 'combined', 'slow', 'development', 'plot', 'hypnotic', 'addictive', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'unique', 'feel.The', 'soundtrack', 'mostly', 'french', 'duo', 'Air', 'also', 'strange', 'yet', 'captivating', 'feel', 'offering', 'perfect', 'musical', 'combination', 'unsettling', 'images.We', 'never', 'really', 'know', 'why', 'sisters', 'killed', 'hints', 'are', 'given', 'movie', 'really', 'didn', 't', 'seem', 'connect', 'envoironment', 'partially', 'parents', 'attitude', 'also', 'due', 'adolescence', 'period', 'had', 'started', 'experience', 'saw', 'world', 'peculiar', 'way', 'discovering', 'mysteries', 'one', 'else', 'noticed.The', 'effects', 'isolation', 'lack', 'communication', 'are', 'well', 'handled', 'here', 'especially', 'one', 'last', 'scenes', 'where', 'girls', 'play', 'music', 'phone', 'neighbours', 'indeed', 'excellent', 'very', 'well-observed', 'coming-of-age', 'moment', 'truly', 'memmorable', 'sequence.Although', 'unengaging', 'scenes', 'characters', 'viewer', 'isn', 't', 'allowed', 'know', 'connect', 'quot', 'Virgin', 'Suicides', 'quot', 'still', 'fine', 'effort', 'worthwile', 'indie', 'movie', 'troubled', 'confused', 'teenagers', 's', 'also', 'sucessful', 'film', 'explore', 'quot', 'peaceful', 'quot', 'quot', 'quot', 'american', 'suburbia', 'where', 'apparently', 's', 'not', 'much', 'going', 'on.Recommended']",N/A

524700,A1KLG8F5APLM2N,B00003CXH0,h,"[2, 3]","I once had this friend in high school, Suzy.  She was the quiet little queen bee of ninth grade.  Her parents had no idea that she snuck out of their home every night and returned every morning with her tousled, perfect curls still in order, undetected.  Eventually her father discovered these midnight trysts and punished her by taking away her makeup for a week.I guess when you are living in a stale household, you are beautiful (and know it), and in need of some stimulation, you can always use your beauty as a weapon - just don't get caught.I loved the Virgin Suicide's character of Lux.  Here is a girl, like ""Suzy"" who is bored with being gorgeous and decided to use it as a weapon to save herself from her 1970's life of ""Not my Girls""- style parenting.  Lux has beautiful sisters as well, but they don't have developed personalities and are more of a character in whole that sympathize with her.  Lux is the queen bee and leader of this family pack of admired beauties.As a young teenager she is discovering the power of her own sexuality.  Her curiosities about boys and the outside world away from her parent-controlled, sterile environment lead her to rebellious behavior and experimentation with the opposite sex.  Lux is one of Sofia Coppola's more shallow female creatures discovering the thrills of her own charms.  She is reminiscent of Coppola's ""Marie Antoinette"" in her young innocence and ability to indulge in the occasional lack of constant supervision.  Lux and her sisters are desperate for some kind of change, a catalyst, someone to rescue them from their lives after losing one sister to suicide.  They are in dire need of escape before they lose themselves in an ordinary life.  I highly recommend this movie and also suggest: the new ""Marie Antoinette"" if you are interested in Sofia's continued progress on the exploitation of young , sexually blooming teenage minds allowed to run wild with self-abandon.  It's easy to see Sofia's point when watching both films back to back - Dunst, as Lux or Marie Antoinette is still the same teenager-they are still using their young powers of seduction to tantalize and get what they want.  One happens to be the queen bee of her high school, the other the queen of France - nonetheless, the same desperate girl in need of affection and attention.",5,If Beauty were a Religion....,1163894400,"11 19, 2006",2006,2318,"['once', 'had', 'friend', 'high', 'school', 'Suzy', 'was', 'quiet', 'little', 'queen', 'bee', 'ninth', 'grade', 'parents', 'had', 'idea', 'snuck', 'home', 'night', 'returned', 'morning', 'tousled', 'perfect', 'curls', 'still', 'order', 'undetected', 'Eventually', 'father', 'discovered', 'midnight', 'trysts', 'punished', 'taking', 'away', 'makeup', 'week.I', 'guess', 'when', 'are', 'living', 'stale', 'household', 'are', 'beautiful', 'know', 'need', 'stimulation', 'can', 'always', 'use', 'beauty', 'weapon', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'caught.I', 'loved', 'Virgin', 'Suicide', 'character', 'Lux', 'Here', 'girl', 'Suzy', 'who', 'bored', 'being', 'gorgeous', 'decided', 'use', 'weapon', 'save', '1970', 'life', 'Not', 'Girls', 'style', 'parenting', 'Lux', 'beautiful', 'sisters', 'as', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'developed', 'personalities', 'are', 'more', 'character', 'whole', 'sympathize', 'Lux', 'queen', 'bee', 'leader', 'family', 'pack', 'admired', 'beauties.As', 'young', 'teenager', 'discovering', 'power', 'own', 'sexuality', 'curiosities', 'boys', 'outside', 'world', 'away', 'parent-controlled', 'sterile', 'environment', 'lead', 'rebellious', 'behavior', 'experimentation', 'opposite', 'sex', 'Lux', 'one', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'more', 'shallow', 'female', 'creatures', 'discovering', 'thrills', 'own', 'charms', 'reminiscent', 'Coppola', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'young', 'innocence', 'ability', 'indulge', 'occasional', 'lack', 'constant', 'supervision', 'Lux', 'sisters', 'are', 'desperate', 'kind', 'change', 'catalyst', 'someone', 'rescue', 'lives', 'losing', 'one', 'sister', 'suicide', 'are', 'dire', 'need', 'escape', 'lose', 'ordinary', 'life', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'also', 'suggest', 'new', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'are', 'interested', 'Sofia', 'continued', 'progress', 'exploitation', 'young', 'sexually', 'blooming', 'teenage', 'minds', 'allowed', 'run', 'wild', 'self-abandon', 'easy', 'see', 'Sofia', 'point', 'when', 'watching', 'films', 'back', 'back', 'Dunst', 'Lux', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'still', 'same', 'teenager-they', 'are', 'still', 'using', 'young', 'powers', 'seduction', 'tantalize', 'get', 'what', 'want', 'One', 'be', 'queen', 'bee', 'high', 'school', 'other', 'queen', 'France', 'nonetheless', 'same', 'desperate', 'girl', 'need', 'affection', 'attention']",N/A

524702,AMF5LHI9IOIH1,B00003CXH0,Irishgirl,"[2, 3]","In her directorial debut, Sofia Coppola (daughter of famous director Francis Ford Coppola) hits an interesting mark with 2000's ""The Virgin Suicides;"" a film that takes a stunning look at the pressures that go with coming of age, family, love, etc. The narration and the film overall is almost poetic at times; almost like the five teenage girls we're dealing with in this film. Their lives seem to be one huge poem of isolation, freedom, romance and being social. It is a unique film that intertwines the curiosity of coming-of-age innocence with the darkness of death. Amongst the social activities at school and the so-called dating, these five girls are about to explode.We're heading back to the late 1970's; a much more innocent time than today. The story revolves around the Lisbon household, where the five teenage Lisbon girls, Mary, Cecilia, Therese, Bonnie, and Lux (Kristin Dunst) are isolated from sociality by their uptight perfectionist mother (Kathleen Turner) and rather oblivious father (James Woods) who seems wrapped in his own little world. We as viewers really don't get to know the girls well and what makes them individuals, but that seems to be what is intended of this film. The five teens are like one group gelled together; quiet and subdued in the shadow of their parents, but yet brimming with hormones and those conniving looks in their eyes.The Lisbon girls are the objects of obsession for a group of neighborhood boys; basically a group of your normal average young Joe's who got the privilege of attending the girls' only party in the Lisbon home. Of course the parents tried to make it as boring and uptight as possible. That was the night that the youngest Lisbon, Cecilia decided to be the first to do the unthinkable deed. It's weird, but we really didn't get to see much emotion at all from the other sisters apart from seeing them cuddling together in their bedroom. But this film is obviously not about overdoing the emotion and personalities of the Lisbon girls. Coppola does a fine job of giving us viewers the feeling of these girls kind of drifting along in a poetic-like atmosphere amongst the pressures. You get the strong feeling that they're being held back and then just decide matter-of-factly to fade away. I believe that Cecilia kind of represented what the group was going through though. The others may have hid what they were feeling, but we did get to see Cecilia rather depressed, detached and very uninterested in the party. Thus, she started the tragic chain of events.But I digress. Josh Harnett makes an exciting appearance as Trip Fontaine; the smooth, suave, handsome ladies man who also loves his weed and peach schnapps. Falling head-over-heels in love with Lux Lisbon, he finally convinces her parents to let him take her to the prom. Only problem is, after some evening delight on the football field, Lux ends up making a huge mistake with her curfew. So you think that Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon were strict? Now they are all that and more, as the girls are literally ""barred"" into their home. But who comes to the rescue? The average young Joe neighborhood boys! They represent the girls' only contact with the outside world (apart with some rooftop fun that Lux resorts to). The boys, who had done everything to be close the Lisbon's in the first place, now were their direct link and seemingly saving grace. Together, they go through rather dreamy and poetic adventures together. My absolute favorite part in the film is when the boys and the Lisbon's start playing records to each other over the phone, picking songs that describe their feelings. Being a huge fan of song expression, I thought this was one of the best and touching parts in the film. How when it's all said and done, the girls can rely on the normal average boys who worship them, to help them survive a little longer. I stress a LITTLE longer.The film is enjoyable and has superb acting. James Woods is awesome as the Lisbon dad who gets engrossed in talking to plants, as well as himself. He plays this oblivious, in-another-world part perfectly. I like Kathleen Turner and she does a fine job as the mother. I kind of wanted to see her be a bit more strict, because there were times when I thought the girls might be overreacting in wanting to kill themselves. I mean, a lot of parents can be overprotective and strict. But believe me, I've seen a lot worse than the Lisbon's. However, I know that Coppola was not trying to overdo, but rather give us an idea of what was happening and then let our minds do the rest. This aspect works perfectly and makes her film great. And Josh Harnett was perfect for the role as Trip. He was a trip alright, with those boyish good looks that girls couldn't get enough of.Also let me say that the soundtrack is awesome!! I'm a fan of 70's music, and this film is packed with them, from Todd Rundgren's ""Hello It's Me,"" to The Electric Light Orchestra's ""Strange Magic,"" to Heart's ""Crazy On You,"" to Styx' ""Come Sail Away."" This awesome music defined an era and spoke of many a persons heart. Also included is the making of the film, which really shows Sofia Coppola's involvement with the cast and script, and an inside look at everything that made the film unique. Okay, so you should be done reading this now. Get up and grab up this piece of rather poetic perfection!",4,Poetry In Motion,1169251200,"01 20, 2007",2007,5344,"['directorial', 'debut', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'daughter', 'famous', 'director',

Five is a pentacle of the devil, a pentad of five girls who will all eventually stage their suicide in public in order to make it what it was supposed to be a successful show, a show completely fulfilled till the real end of their life, of their five lives. On the other side four boys and a fifth one who was an outsider. The latter was to become the deadly trigger of the last four suicides after the first one was successful though only on the second trial or attempt, an encore if you want. The film is well done because it creates the right atmosphere of these teenagers, daughters and sons of the babyboomers who got absolutely bored in their life that had become long tedious useless studies, postponed sexuality, nothing to desire anymore in this oversatisfied middle class consumer's society and the list of those evil goods or good evils could be very long. Our modern society took away simple sentiments like desiring and longing for and replaced them with oversatisfaction, overconsumption, consumerizing. Then since morality and ethics developed at the same pace, sex became forbidden, hence clandestine, hence rebellious, hence a door to the unknwn that everyone around you will make guilty, dirty, worthless. What the heck if life is nothing but running after some forbidden dirt ! Sofia Cappola takes the problem from the point of view of these five sisters but through the eyes of the five, four + one, boys who become the voyeurs of the scene with binoculars, periscope, telescope, cameras, pictures, diaries read to remember the girls, etc. The voyeurs appear as naive and kind of simpleminded. It does not matter : they are only the eyes Sofia Coppola uses to make us see the five sisters. Hence it is superficial and trite and the parents, particularly the mother, appear to be ogrelike monsters. It's true that Trip, the outsider who triggers the final run of the second wave of four suicides, is a real monster. He loved the girl till he took her to the football field and made her woman. That is no love. That is luring a prey into a trap with music, good looks and alcohol. He had the grossness of leaving her in the middle of the night, asleep in the grass and telling twenty-five years later that it felt differently then. Sure, since she no longer was a virgin and he was only attracted by virgins and he was a virgin lady's man (the lady of course not the rogue boy), an insatiable hungry dog who considered his ladies as some food deluxe but that became soiled as soon as they were used once. The typical consumer who buys, eats and then rejects behind him. That does not excuse the Christian bigotry of the mother and the scientific aloofness of the father, but at times it takes very little to turn a disater into a catastrophe, a storm into a hurricane.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne",5,Burn this damned Rock records!!!,1170201600,"01 31, 2007",2007,2900,"['Five', 'bad', 'omen', 'Five', 'pentacle', 'devil', 'pentad', 'five', 'girls', 'who', 'will', 'eventually', 'stage', 'suicide', 'public', 'order', 'make', 'what', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'successful', 'show', 'show', 'completely', 'fulfilled', 'till', 'real', 'end', 'life', 'five', 'lives', 'other', 'side', 'four', 'boys', 'fifth', 'one', 'who', 'was', 'outsider', 'latter', 'was', 'become', 'deadly', 'trigger', 'last', 'four', 'suicides', 'first', 'one', 'was', 'successful', 'only', 'second', 'trial', 'attempt', 'encore', 'want', 'film', 'well', 'done', 'right', 'atmosphere', 'teenagers', 'daughters', 'sons', 'babyboomers', 'who', 'got', 'absolutely', 'bored', 'life', 'had', 'become', 'long', 'tedious', 'useless', 'studies', 'postponed', 'sexuality', 'nothing', 'desire', 'anymore', 'oversatisfied', 'middle', 'class', 'consumer', 'society', 'list', 'evil', 'goods', 'good', 'evils', 'could', 'be', 'very', 'long', 'modern', 'society', 'took', 'away', 'simple', 'sentiments', 'desiring', 'longing', 'replaced', 'oversatisfaction', 'overconsumption', 'consumerizing', 'Then', 'morality', 'ethics', 'developed', 'same', 'pace', 'sex', 'became', 'forbidden', 'hence', 'clandestine', 'hence', 'rebellious', 'hence', 'door', 'unknwn', 'everyone', 'will', 'make', 'guilty', 'dirty', 'worthless', 'What', 'heck', 'life', 'nothing', 'running', 'forbidden', 'dirt', 'Sofia', 'Cappola', 'problem', 'point', 'view', 'five', 'sisters', 'eyes', 'five', 'four', '+', 'one', 'who', 'become', 'voyeurs', 'scene', 'binoculars', 'periscope', 'telescope', 'cameras', 'pictures', 'diaries', 'read', 'remember', 'girls', 'etc', 'voyeurs', 'appear', 'naive', 'kind', 'simpleminded', 'not', 'matter', 'are', 'only', 'eyes', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'make', 'see', 'five', 'sisters', 'Hence', 'superficial', 'trite', 'parents', 'particularly', 'mother', 'appear', 'be', 'ogrelike', 'monsters', 'true', 'Trip', 'outsider', 'who', 'final', 'run', 'second', 'wave', 'four', 'suicides', 'real', 'monster', 'loved', 'girl', 'till', 'took', 'football', 'field', 'made', 'woman', 'love', 'luring', 'prey', 'trap', 'music', 'good', 'looks', 'alcohol', 'had', 'grossness', 'leaving', 'middle', 'night', 'asleep', 'grass', 'telling', 'twenty-five', 'years', 'later', 'felt', 'differently', 'then', 'Sure', 'no', 'longer', 'was', 'virgin', 'was', 'only', 'attracted', 'virgins', 'was', 'virgin', 'lady', 'man', 'lady', 'course', 'not', 'rogue', 'boy', 'insatiable', 'hungry', 'dog', 'who', 'considered', 'ladies', 'food', 'deluxe', 'became', 'soiled', 'as', 'soon', 'were', 'used', 'once', 'typical', 'consumer', 'who', 'eats', 'then', 'rejects', 'not', 'excuse', 'Christian', 'bigotry', 'mother', 'scientific', 'aloofness', 'father', 'times', 'very', 'little', 'turn', 'disater', 'catastrophe', 'storm', 'hurricane.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne']",N/A
524704,A1A535W556ROBQ,B00003CXH0,James Ferguson,"[8, 9]","Sofia Coppola brings the book magically to life in a thoroughly engaging movie.  Coppola not only connects with the tragic Lisbon girls but with the 70's as well, giving the movie a sumptuous feel like the songs of &quot;Heart,&quot; whose &quot;Magic Man&quot; provides the perfect intro for Trip Fontaine.  Even the cinematography recalls that time.  To her credit, she doesn't try to unravel the mystery that surrounds these girls' suicides, leaving the viewer to sort out the details as the four teenage boys try to do so.I couldn't help but think that Eugenides and Coppola both drew from &quot;Picnic at Hanging Rock.&quot;  The book had an odd Victorian feel to it, given its setting in the 70's, and Coppola seemed to take the same loving approach to her characters. I thought she handled the cloistered lives of the Lisbon girls very well.  James Woods and Kathleen Turner are almost unrecognizable as their parents, whose fundamental views are sharply at odds with the free-spirited time, which the girls so much want to take part in. Coppola treated the eventful Homecoming dance very well and the tragic events which follow.  I especially liked the way she handled Trip, dramatically presenting him but not fawning over him as Eugenides did in the novel.This was a very impressive debut for Sofia Coppola and she followed it up well in &quot;Lost in Translation.&quot; She has a remarkable sense of her characters and setting, due to an especially fine eye for detail.",5,A sumptuous movie,1088985600,"07 5, 2004",2004,1480,"['Sofia', 'Coppola', 'book', 'magically', 'life', 'thoroughly', 'engaging', 'movie', 'Coppola', 'not', 'only', 'tragic', 'Lisbon', 'girls', '70', 'as', 'well', 'giving', 'movie', 'sumptuous', 'feel', 'songs', 'quot', 'Heart', 'quot', 'quot', 'Magic', 'Man', 'quot', 'perfect', 'intro', 'Trip', 'Fontaine', 'Even', 'cinematography', 'time', 'credit', ""n't"", 'try', 'unravel', 'mystery', 'girls', 'suicides', 'leaving', 'viewer', 'sort', 'out', 'details', 'four', 'teenage', 'boys', 'try', 'do', 'so.I', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'Eugenides', 'Coppola', 'drew', 'quot', 'Picnic', 'Hanging', 'Rock.', 'quot', 'book', 'had', 'odd', 'Victorian', 'feel', 'given', 'setting', '70', 'Coppola', 'seemed', 'take', 'same', 'loving', 'approach', 'characters', 'thought', 'handled', 'cloistered', 'lives', 'Lisbon', 'girls', 'very', 'well', 'James', 'Woods', 'Kathleen', 'Turner', 'are', 'almost', 'unrecognizable', 'parents', 'fundamental', 'views', 'are', 'sharply', 'odds', 'free-spirited', 'time', 'girls', 'so', 'much', 'want', 'take', 'part', 'Coppola', 'treated', 'eventful', 'Homecoming', 'dance', 'very', 'well', 'tragic', 'events', 'follow', 'especially', 'liked', 'way', 'handled', 'Trip', 'dramatically', 'presenting', 'not', 'fawning', 'over', 'Eugenides', 'did', 'novel.This', 'was', 'very', 'impressive', 'debut', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'followed', 'up', 'well', 'quot', 'Lost', 'Translation.', 'quot', 'remarkable', 'sense', 'characters', 'setting', 'due', 'especially', 'fine', 'eye', 'detail']",N/A

Regrettably, it didn't improve with a second viewing.Proclaiming any work of art a masterpiece may be the artistic equivalent of Einstein's' theory of Relativity in that it depends on the perspective of the viewer. I should state upfront that I'm not a teenager, so maybe I shouldn't be commenting on a film made from a famous book on the subject of teen suicides. And to be honest, this film may have poignancy to younger viewers that was lost on my mature sensibilities. I was brought up on the films of Ingmar Bergman and Stanley Kubrick, so I'm not hooked on thrill a minute, T & A festivals or on following Indiana Jones on another crusade. For me a film is either good or not good---------or great, when you're lucky enough to find one and awful when you're not. A film either has to have marvelous action/special effects, or have a good story and be intellectually engaging. I prefer the latter. I expected the latter in the case of THE VIRGIN SUICIDES. Instead I found suppressed hormones and five teenage girls who believe that being female is a liability. Almost as a religious pact, they decide to withdraw from the world permanently.The Lisbons are a highly dysfunctional family. Dad is a socially inept math teacher, while mom is a strict disciplinarian who forgets she was once a young girl. I call the family dysfunctional, yet the nice middle class family I saw on the screen is quite common in American life. That may be the real and tragic message of this film...",2,What Is The Nature Of A Masterpiece?,992822400,"06 18, 2001",2001,1778,"['watched', 'DVD', 'THE', 'VIRGIN', 'SUICIDES', 'again', 'last', 'night', 'hope', 'had', 'misjudged', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'most', 'people', ""'m"", 'susceptible', 'movie', 'reviews', 'reading', 'words', 'magnificent', 'glorious', 'haunting', 'brilliant', 'directorial', 'debut', 'wanted', 'love', 'film', 'Regrettably', 'did', ""n't"", 'improve', 'second', 'viewing.Proclaiming', 'work', 'art', 'masterpiece', 'may', 'be', 'artistic', 'equivalent', 'Einstein', 'theory', 'Relativity', 'perspective', 'viewer', 'should', 'state', ""'m"", 'not', 'teenager', 'maybe', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'commenting', 'film', 'made', 'famous', 'book', 'subject', 'teen', 'suicides', 'be', 'honest', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'poignancy', 'younger', 'viewers', 'was', 'lost', 'mature', 'sensibilities', 'was', 'brought', 'up', 'films', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', ""'m"", 'not', 'hooked', 'thrill', 'minute', 'T', 'A', 'festivals', 'following', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'crusade', 'film', 'either', 'good', 'not', 'good', '-or', 'great', 'when', ""'re"", 'lucky', 'enough', 'find', 'one', 'awful', 'when', ""'re"", 'not', 'A', 'film', 'either', 'have', 'marvelous', 'action/special', 'effects', 'have', 'good', 'story', 'be', 'intellectually', 'engaging', 'prefer', 'latter', 'expected', 'latter', 'case', 'THE', 'VIRGIN', 'SUICIDES', 'Instead', 'found', 'suppressed', 'hormones', 'five', 'teenage', 'girls', 'who', 'believe', 'being', 'female', 'liability', 'Almost', 'religious', 'pact', 'decide', 'withdraw', 'world', 'permanently.The', 'Lisbons', 'are', 'highly', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'Dad', 'socially', 'inept', 'math', 'teacher', 'mom', 'strict', 'disciplinarian', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'young', 'girl', 'call', 'family', 'dysfunctional', 'nice', 'middle', 'class', 'family', 'saw', 'screen', 'quite', 'common', 'American', 'life', 'may', 'be', 'real', 'tragic', 'message', 'film']",N/A

Yet almost none of my friends had seen it before I recommended it to them.Told from the perspective of the neighbourhood boys, who by the time they are telling their story have grown to adulthood, the film tells the story of the five Lisbon sisters and has the haunting atmosphere of memories which are simultaneously joyous and painful.  This is aided by vaguely defuse lighting and very slight blurring of the image, which for other films would be a disaster, but here is an integral part of the story.The cast are universally strong, with stand out performances from Kathleen Turner as the mother who refuses to allow her children to grow up, James Woods as her reticent almost hen pecked husband, Josh Hartnett as the shallow school jock Tripp Fontaine, with Michael Pare as the same character after the years and the hard living have caught up with him and Hanna R Hall as the youngest sister Cecilia who in her scenes with Danny Devito's Psychiatrist portrays adolescent depression and irony with a grace that can't help but bring a smile of recognition to your face,But it's Kirsten Dunst who's performance as the second youngest sister, Lux which is the greatest treasure.  Her role is perhaps the most difficult and demanding in the whole film combining girlish innocence with vampish eroticism and a deep sense of confusion underlying it all.  Most child actors remain just that, Children, precocious ness fails to translate into mature talent.  Happily there are exceptions (Roddy Mc Dowell and Elizabeth Taylor spring to mind) and this is one.  Kirsten Dunst's early promise shown in &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; has been comprehensively built on.  Based on her magnificent performance here, who knows how great she could eventually be.The soundtrack combines original material by the French group Air with real 70's classics by ELO, Styx, The Hollies and others that EVERYONE was listening to in the 70's but no one will admit to liking now, but secretly love to hear again.Sofia Coppola may not have been a top-drawer actress, but based on the evidence of this film she may just be a truly gifted director.  Permeated with a tragic sense of loss wafting through the film like the smell in the drawing rooms, Virgin Suicides gives you a window on the meteoric highs and lows of youth, it's almost like a still picture of that all too brief time in everyone's life where the world opens up for the first time making anything seem possible and the sights, sounds, flavours, feelings and personalities around you are more intense than they ever were before or ever will be again.",5,Delicate and moving.

How simple it could have been do just cast the mother of the Lisbon girls as cruel and insane, to have it be an update of Carrie, sans the prom mayhem.  Instead we get a unique portrait of a disturbed but basically decent family who simply could not cope.  The real main characters are, of course, the boys.  They are obsessed with the girls across the street and who can blame them?  Five stunning blond goddesses, ages 13 through 17, all devastatingly beautiful, Kirsten Dunst is as lovely as ever, she is always pretty but this film really takes advantage of the ethereal, dreamlike quality of her, throwing her hair around in slow motion and winking at the camera. It would look stupid on any other actress. It is also a perfect homage to the shampoo ads of the 1970's, not a parody but a respectful nod.  Basically we have a dysfunctional family without a clear villain.  The mother simply will not allow her daughters to grow up or to leave the house accept for school. The father (Played brilliantly by James Wood) is a dishrag. plain and simple, he won't stand up to his wife and just goes along with things, he is also seriously detached from reality.  When his youngest daughter kills herself he watches a ballgame when the priest comes to comfort him, he never acknowledges what happened. This sounds very cruel and indeed it would be, but the girls have never known another life and so they endure it and rebel in there own ways.  Lux ( Dunst) is a sexual dynamo and throws herself at boys and men alike, the trash man etc.  She uses her beauty as a weapon, her only weapon perhaps, but an effective one.  The youngest is the first to die, she kills herself in a deeply disturbing manor that would be much too gruesome in the hands of a lesser director, Sofia Coppala is as good as everyone says, I don't know if her father had his hand in this or not but whoever did this did it very well.  Watching this film reminded me of real people, the pretty girls in the 70's who had less then no time for me but whom I would watch, form a safe distance of course! Girls that were never seen accept at school or church but who grew up anyway, for better or worse.  The suicides are not realistic but that is part of the overall feel of the film, the boys watch as we watch, from the theater seats (or living room chair) not understanding the strange creatures we call girls.  The mystery of the Lisbon girls untimely deaths is, I think, the mystery that cannot be solved and the deaths represent the end of obsession, of seeing the opposite sex as visions through a telescope (or a movie screen), of course they never get over it, even as grown ups whenever they met, they tried to put together the evidence to figure out why, they won't and neither will we.  The Virgin Suicides is about life's mysteries and how we never solve them and we never should.",5,"They could have taken the easy way, they did not.",1051747200,"05 1, 2003",2003,2945,"['Watching', 'film', 'while', 'bought', '2000', 'appreciate', 'more', 'more', 'How', 'simple', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'do', 'just', 'cast', 'mother', 'Lisbon', 'girls', 'cruel', 'insane', 'have', 'be', 'update', 'Carrie', 'prom', 'mayhem', 'Instead', 'get', 'unique', 'portrait', 'disturbed', 'basically', 'decent', 'family', 'who', 'simply', 'could', 'not', 'cope', 'real', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'course', 'boys', 'are', 'obsessed', 'girls', 'street', 'who', 'can', 'blame', 'Five', 'stunning', 'blond', 'goddesses', '13', '17', 'devastatingly', 'beautiful', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'as', 'lovely', 'ever', 'always', 'pretty', 'film', 'really', 'advantage', 'ethereal', 'dreamlike', 'quality', 'throwing', 'hair', 'slow', 'motion', 'winking', 'camera', 'would', 'look', 'stupid', 'other', 'actress', 'also', 'perfect', 'homage', 'shampoo', 'ads', '1970', 'not', 'parody', 'respectful', 'nod', 'Basically', 'have', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'clear', 'villain', 'mother', 'simply', 'will', 'not', 'allow', 'daughters', 'grow', 'up', 'leave', 'house', 'accept', 'school', 'father', 'Played', 'brilliantly', 'James', 'Wood', 'dishrag', 'plain', 'simple', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stand', 'up', 'wife', 'just', 'along', 'things', 'also', 'seriously', 'detached', 'reality', 'When', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'kills', 'ballgame', 'when', 'priest', 'comfort', 'never', 'what', 'happened', 'very', 'cruel', 'indeed', 'would', 'be', 'girls', 'have', 'never', 'known', 'life', 'so', 'endure', 'rebel', 'there', 'own', 'ways', 'Lux', 'Dunst', 'sexual', 'dynamo', 'boys', 'men', 'alike', 'trash', 'man', 'etc', 'beauty', 'weapon', 'only', 'weapon', 'perhaps', 'effective', 'one', 'youngest', 'first', 'die', 'deeply', 'disturbing', 'manor', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'too', 'gruesome', 'hands', 'lesser', 'director', 'Sofia', 'Coppala', 'as', 'good', 'everyone', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'father', 'had', 'hand', 'not', 'whoever', 'did', 'did', 'very', 'well', 'Watching', 'film', 'reminded', 'real', 'people', 'pretty', 'girls', '70', 'who', 'had', 'then', 'time', 'whom', 'would', 'watch', 'form', 'safe', 'distance', 'course', 'Girls', 'were', 'never', 'seen', 'accept', 'school', 'church', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'anyway', 'better', 'worse', 'suicides', 'are', 'not', 'realistic', 'part', 'overall', 'feel', 'film', 'boys', 'watch', 'watch', 'theater', 'seats', 'living', 'room', 'chair', 'not', 'understanding', 'strange', 'creatures', 'call', 'girls', 'mystery', 'Lisbon', 'girls', 'untimely', 'deaths', 'think', 'mystery', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'solved', 'deaths', 'represent', 'end', 'obsession', 'seeing', 'opposite', 'sex', 'visions', 'telescope', 'movie', 'screen', 'course', 'never', 'get', 'even', 'grown', 'ups', 'whenever', 'met', 'tried', 'put', 'together', 'evidence', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'wo', ""n't"", 'neither', 'will', 'Virgin', 'Suicides', 'life', 'mysteries', 'how', 'never', 'solve', 'never', 'should']",N/A

Even though the movie starred two well-known actors, James Woods and Kathleen Turner, the focus did not lie with them but with the daughters.  Just as the boys of the neighborhood are bewildered by the enigma of these daughters across the street, you may find yourself just as bewildered after the film has concluded.Although there are a few sisters, the bulk of the story is on the sister played by Kirsten Dunst.  This is more than a film about teen angst.

I realize that to condense a book into an hour and a half long movie, they have to cut certain parts, and not everything will be explained as well as in the book, but I felt that this movie left out a LOT of what made the book so spectacular. The narrator has a much smaller part in the movie than in the book, which leaves a lot more to the imagination (which can sometimes be a good thing, but not in this case), and a lot of the more heart-wrenching details from the book have been cut to make room for cheesy, overly artistic camera work.

""A New Yorker""","[2, 3]","A lot viewer's know that Sofia Coppola is not much of a great actress, but she seems to have inherited some of her father's talents in this film. Coppola knows how to get the best from her actors and a few ""coming of age"" films have the sensual, dream-like quality as this 1974 look at upper middle class American suburbia.Written and directed by her, this mesmerizing account of adolescent sexual socialization (set in the posh suburbs of 1974 Detroit) has a bittersweet quality, yet is tragic as well. A group of young teenage boys come into contact with five bewitchingly beautiful teenage sisters in their affluent neighborhood. Each savor the short time they have with these girls, who are extremely overprotected by their devout Catholic parents (Woods and Turner).Humorous, sensual, and highly evocative of ""boy-meets-girl awkwardness"" as seen through the boys' eyes, this film is a tribute to an American way of life not unlike ""American Beauty"". However, the dreaminess comes to an abrupt end... an ""awakening"", if you will... by the boys as they come to grips with a tragedy they are barely able to comprehend Sofia Coppola is an immensely talented filmmaker. She recreates the 70's era effortlessly, and allows the characters to all be real people instead of mere thumbnail sketches.While this movie might lack a standard plot structure it succeeds dramatically in capturing the mood and feel of a certain generation. Obviously this movie will speak loudest to those who experience adolescence in the seventies but it also communicates strongly to all people recollecting that period of their lives. The great tragedy imparted in this movie is that of young beauty extinguished and the fruitless search to discover how this crime against nature could have occurred.The cinematography is beautiful, never distracting but always full of genuinely real images, which served to offset the hallucination tone of the movie.

524728,A26IJ3A2TRQZAO,B00003CXH0,Kayla,"[49, 64]","The Virgin Suicides is Sofia Coppola's directorial debut, and its effectiveness illustrates that she's better behind the camera than she is in front of it. (Most movie-goers will remember her ill-fated attempt to portray Michael Corleone's daughter in The Godfather III.) Tragic, haunting, and sometimes darkly comedic, this movie leaves a strong impression in its telling of a story about the destruction of innocence. The film is based on the book by Jeffrey Eugenides, which happens to be Coppola's favorite novel. As a result, she felt that, in bringing the adaptation to the screen, she had a strong responsibility to be faithful to the source material.The time frame is the mid-'70s and the setting is an upper class suburban community in Michigan. The film tells the sad story of the five Lisbon sisters - Cecilia (age 13, played by Hanna Hall), Lux (age 14, played by Kirsten Dunst), Bonnie (age 15, played by Chelsea Swain), Mary (age 16, played by A.J. Cook), and Therese (age 17, played by Leslie Hayman) - all of whom come to a bad end before finishing high school (this much is revealed during the introductory voiceover, which is provided by Giovanni Ribisi). Unhappy, neglected Cecilia is the first to give up on life - after surviving one suicide attempt, she is successful on the second try. In the wake of that event, the atmosphere surrounding the surviving sisters becomes grim, and their parents' overprotectiveness threatens to suffocate them. For most children, mothers and fathers set boundaries; for the Lisbons, it's iron bars.The Virgin Suicides is filmed as a memory looking back through 25 years, and the point-of-view is that of a boy who was in love with one (or perhaps all) of the girls. As a result, the events recounted here offer a filtered perspective of the sisters and the complexities of their lives. Presenting things in this manner, The Virgin Suicides manages to be both poignant and touchingly nostalgic. Also, Coppola's style is such that she avoids turning the film into a sudsy melodrama that glamorizes self-destruction.One of The Virgin Suicides' strengths is its ability to effectively capture the nuances of teenage life during the '70s. Coppola gets all of the little things right: the awkwardness of a chaperoned boy/girl party, the thrill of first love, and the nervousness of the pre-dance ritual (in this case, the homecoming dance, not the prom). The film also boasts a solid soundtrack featuring a few songs that haven't been endlessly recycled in other, recent, set-in-the-'70s features. In one key scene, music provides a link between the Lisbon girls and the outside world - it becomes their only viable means of communication and free expression.Most of the cast is comprised of fresh faces, all of whom do solid jobs. The more recognizable names include Kirsten Dunst as Lux (the girl with the most visible role), James Woods (as the girls' father), and Kathleen Turner (as their mother). Josh Hartnett (last seen as the guy who loses the girl in Here On Earth), who is slowly building a reputation in Hollywood, plays heartthrob Trip Fontaine, whose poor treatment of Lux sets off a chain of events that leads to one of the movie's tragedies. The Virgin Suicides also includes excerpts from a modern-day interview with a forty-something Trip (played by Michael Pare), who clearly has regrets about his treatment of Lux.By using occasional bursts of humor and setting up the film as a collage of reminiscences, Coppola establishes a mood that is wistful and sad, but not funereal. There are a few instances when the film gets a little heavy handed, but, for the most part, the tone is well modulated. Although Coppola almost certainly gained more than a little help from her famous father in getting the production off the ground, the talent evident in her debut argues that this is not a case of unwarranted nepotism.

I think it is best expressed when Lux conducts various affairs on the roof. She rebels even though she is virtually tied to the house.

A group of girls so full of youth and beauty and a group of guys who are so gripped by them they become an obsession to them. The girls are living in a prison, with their mother and father watching their every move. They have dreams of being free, wandering through wide open fields and imagining their wildest thoughts. One day a boy arrives on the scene and he changes the girls lives forever. For a moment the girls are free and start to experience life outside their parents limitations. The events of one night take their toll on the girls lives and there was no going back to normality from then on.Such a beautifully crafted movie. The choice of actors couldn't have been better. Kirsten Dunst played Lux like a true star. Lux being the more outrageous and dangerous of the girls, she battles with demons inside but her face shows a different thing.Kathleen Turner as the mother was one of the best castings of them all. The way she portrayed this mother who could not let her daughters grow up and be teenagers and even when she gives them freedom she feels great regret and fear.

524735,A2MS6UV7ZGTMLR,B00003CXH0,"K. M. Talha ""Weird Gurl""","[6, 9]","The Virgin Suicides is set twenty five years ago in a small community in Michigan, and revolves around the household of the Lisbons. Ronald Lisbon (James Woods) is a mathematics teacher at the local school, and lives in suburbia with his wife (Kathleen Turner) and their five lovely daughters - Cecilia (Hanna Hall), Lux (Kirsten Dunst), Bonnie (Chelse Swain), Mary (A.J. Cook) and Therese (Leslie Hayman). Mrs Lisbon has a rather heavy-handed approach to raising her daughters and this includes severe restrictions upon what they can and cannot do, which for teenagers is not a great thing. The other significant part of the story is the neighbourhood boys who find themselves bewitched by the beautiful Lisbon sisters. Indeed, the story is told from the perspective of those neighbourhood boys and in the form of a retrospective narrative as they look back those twenty five years in search of an answer for what happened to the Lisbon sisters. And that is as much of the plot as I intend to divulge, other than to say that as the title suggests, suicide is involved.I went into this review with no inkling of what the film was about, having selected it purely because of the presence of Kirsten Dunst. Having now seen the film, I believe that it is one where the fewer expectations one has going in to the film, the better the understanding that will result. And that is not to suggest that this is a film that is really deep, but rather that it is a story that has no real end and no real answer, merely more questions. In that respect it is a most satisfying story that has been created by Sofia Coppola, and thankfully she did resist the temptation to wrap everything up nice and neatly.Like so many a labour of love, it shows in every beat of the film. Whilst obviously lacking the dynamics of an action film, The Virgin Suicides has this wonderful pace to it, which never drags but never rushes you anywhere. Sofia Coppola has taken the time to let us appreciate the despair, the puzzlement, the wonder and the joy of the experiences in the film. She has allowed the actors the space to bring their characters alive and the whole thing is up there on the screen to see. James Woods is as steady an actor as you could wish for, and this is another fine effort from him. The reactions to the situations he sees are terrific and he brings a solidity and believability to the role of a father trying to cope with situations that are basically beyond coping with. It has been a while since Kathleen Turner has graced our screens, at least in my recollection, and this is no Kathleen Turner of Romancing The Stone fame. This is a much more mature actress and she brings a terrific bland veneer to the role of the mother who can see no wrong in the way she has brought up her daughters.Kirsten Dunst is proving to be something of a moderate surprise as an actress, and she has a bit more depth than the mere good looks that seems to be driving the adolescent market rather mad. Whilst still a long way short of being a great actress, she brings a delightful coquettishness to the role of Lux, the pivotal lust interest of the film. However, her fellow sisters are no less believable throughout, and as a group this family, whilst a tad unusual, is easily believed and accepted. Josh Hartnett plays the obligatory young male hunk, the guy all the girls swoon over, pretty well and it would seem that this is a role that suits him well enough. He is, however, perhaps the least believable character here for me. Scott Glenn and Danny De Vito make virtual cameos here, and neither are especially memorable.With a nicely crafted story, and an obviously sympathetic director, the result is a fine film. Whilst I am not going to proclaim Sofia Coppola the second coming of her old man, there is every indication here that if she so chooses, she might well be a director to watch given the right sort of material. Approach this with an open mind and you too might find something here that engages. It might not be pure entertainment, but it is a film that rewards the viewing.",4,A  movie with a well crafted plot!,1103846400,"12 24, 2004",2004,4070,"['Virgin', 'Suicides', 'set', 'twenty', 'five', 'years', 'ago', 'small', 'community', 'Michigan', 'around', 'household', 'Lisbons', 'Ronald', 'Lisbon', 'James', 'Woods', 'mathematics', 'teacher', 'local', 'school', 'suburbia', 'wife', 'Kathleen', 'Turner', 'five', 'lovely', 'daughters', 'Cecilia', 'Hanna', 'Hall', 'Lux', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Bonnie', 'Chelse', 'Swain', 'Mary', 'A.J', 'Cook', 'Therese', 'Leslie', 'Hayman', 'Mrs', 'Lisbon', 'rather', 'heavy-handed', 'approach', 'raising', 'daughters', 'severe', 'restrictions', 'what', 'can', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'teenagers', 'not', 'great', 'thing', 'other', 'significant', 'part', 'story', 'neighbourhood', 'boys', 'who', 'find', 'bewitched', 'beautiful', 'Lisbon', 'sisters', 'Indeed', 'story', 'told', 'perspective', 'neighbourhood', 'boys', 'form', 'retrospective', 'narrative', 'look', 'back', 'twenty', 'five', 'years', 'search', 'answer', 'what', 'happened', 'Lisbon', 'sisters', 'as', 'much', 'plot', 'intend', 'divulge', 'other', 'say', 'title', 'suicide', 'involved.I', 'went', 'review', 'inkling', 'what', 'film', 'was', 'about', 'having', 'selected', 'purely', 'presence', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Having', 'now', 'seen', 'film', 'believe', 'one', 'where', 'fewer', 'expectations', 'one', 'going', 'film', 'better', 'understanding', 'will', 'result', 'not', 'suggest', 'film', 'really', 'deep', 'rather', 'story', 'real', 'end', 'real', 'answer', 'merely', 'more', 'questions', 'respect', 'most', 'satisfying', 'story', 'been', 'created', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'thankfully', 'did', 'resist', 'temptation', 'wrap', 'everything', 'up', 'nice', 'neatly.Like', 'so', 'many', 'labour', 'love', 'beat', 'film', 'Whilst', 'obviously', 'lacking', 'dynamics', 'action', 'film', 'Virgin', 'Suicides', 'wonderful', 'pace', 'never', 'never', 'rushes', 'anywhere', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'taken', 'time', 'let', 'appreciate', 'despair', 'puzzlement', 'wonder', 'joy', 'experiences', 'film', 'allowed', 'actors', 'space', 'bring', 'characters', 'alive', 'whole', 'thing', 'up', 'there', 'screen', 'see', 'James', 'Woods', 'steady', 'actor', 'could', 'wish', 'fine', 'effort', 'reactions', 'situations', 'are', 'terrific', 'solidity', 'believability', 'role', 'father', 'trying', 'cope', 'situations', 'are', 'basically', 'coping', 'been', 'while', 'Kathleen', 'Turner', 'graced', 'screens', 'least', 'recollection', 'Kathleen', 'Turner', 'Romancing', 'Stone', 'fame', 'much', 'more', 'mature', 'actress', 'terrific', 'bland', 'veneer', 'role', 'mother', 'who', 'can', 'see', 'wrong', 'way', 'brought', 'up', 'daughters.Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'proving', 'be', 'something', 'moderate', 'surprise', 'actress', 'bit', 'more', 'depth', 'mere', 'good', 'looks', 'be', 'driving', 'adolescent', 'market', 'rather', 'mad', 'Whilst', 'still', 'long', 'way', 'short', 'being', 'great', 'actress', 'delightful', 'coquettishness', 'role', 'Lux', 'pivotal', 'lust', 'interest', 'film', 'However', 'fellow', 'sisters', 'are', 'less', 'believable', 'group', 'family', 'tad', 'unusual', 'easily', 'believed', 'accepted', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'obligatory', 'young', 'male', 'hunk', 'guy', 'girls', 'swoon', 'pretty', 'well', 'would', 'seem', 'role', 'suits', 'well', 'enough', 'however', 'perhaps', 'least', 'believable', 'character', 'here', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'Danny', 'De', 'Vito', 'make', 'virtual', 'cameos', 'here', 'are', 'especially', 'memorable.With', 'nicely', 'crafted', 'story', 'obviously', 'sympathetic', 'director', 'result', 'fine', 'film', 'Whilst', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'proclaim', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'second', 'coming', 'old', 'man', 'indication', 'here', 'so', 'might', 'well', 'be', 'director', 'watch', 'given', 'right', 'sort', 'material', 'Approach', 'open', 'mind', 'too', 'might', 'find', 'something', 'here', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'pure', 'entertainment', 'film', 'viewing']",N/A

524737,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00003CXH0,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[23, 28]","Apparently those who cannot act, can direct.  The legendary bad performance Sofia Coppola turned in for her father's &quot;The Godfather, Part III,&quot; will now be reduced to being the prelude to what should be a stunning career as a director.  Currently nominated for Oscars for both writing and directing Best Picture nominee &quot;Lost in Translation,&quot; Coppola already proved her competence behind the camera in her first full-length feature, &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot; (She previously made a 14-minute short, &quot;Lick the Star&quot;).  They will be arguing heredity versus environment on Sofia Coppola for the next half-century.As our story begins, we are informed by the film's narrator (Giovanni Ribisi) that the first of the Lisbon sisters to attempt suicide, was the youngest, Cecilia (Hannah Hall).  Told by the doctor that she is not old enough to know how bad life gets, Cecilia calmly responds, &quot;Obviously, Doctor, you've never been a thirteen year old girl.&quot;  Having watched &quot;Thirteen&quot; this week, I know bad that age can be, but that is not what &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot; are about.  This film is more about what the boys in the neighborhood thought about the Lisbon sisters than what drove them to suicide.Strangely enough, &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot; is not a black comedy, although there are a few moments along those lines, mostly supplied by the adults in the narrative.  The boys in the neighborhood worship the Lisbon sisters as icons of both feminine beauty and mystery, especially Lux (Kirsten Dunst), the second youngest of the quintet and the one who is most determined to have done some living before she dies.There is a metaphor at work big time in &quot;The Virgin Suicides,&quot; because the Lisbon sisters might kill themselves, but the ideal they represented to the boys in the neighborhood will live forever.  Coppola creates a wonderful romantic scene when the girls are pulled from school and shut up in their house in maximum security isolation by their mother (Kathleen Turner) after the death of Cecilia.  The boys and girls exchange phone calls in which they play songs from their favorites records, never saying a word, but communicating a lot of emotions in their selections.  What impresses you about Coppola's direction in this film is that she keeps the story and her camera under control.  There really are not big moments in this film, just skillfully crafted small ones.The cast also features James Woods as the girls' father, Scott Glenn as Father Moody, and Danny Devito as Dr. Horniker.  You get the feeling that daddy's name might have gotten them to read the script at which point the script sold them on participating in this one.

524738,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B00003CXH0,Lawyeraau,"[27, 34]","Based upon the best-selling novel of the same name, this is an intriguing  film that showcases the directorial debut of Sofia Coppola, daughter of revered director Francis Coppola. She does a fairly masterful  job, indicative of the fact that the apple appears not to have fallen far from the tree. Ms. Coppola exacts tight, well-nuanced performances from the stellar cast, creating an interesting and quirky little gem of a film.The crux of the film takes place in the mid-nineteen seventies in a suburban town in Michigan and is centered upon the lovely Lisbon sisters. Originally five in number, one takes a header out the window in a successful suicide attempt, leaving the four older ones to continue to live with their repressive parents.  This suicide garners press attention, and the Lisbon sister arouse the curiosity of the local teenage boys, become goddesses upon whom their adolescent sexual curiosity falls. In their eyes, the surviving Lisbon sisters  are the local ""It"" girls.Their father (James Woods), a teacher in the local high school, seems dominated by his wife (Kathleen Turner), who as a mother has certain failings. She is quite repressive, and, while instilling in her daughters intellectual curiosity, she does all she can to ensure that they become stunted emotionally, crushing their budding sexuality by any means necessary, no matter how draconian. Still, the oldest one, Lux (Kirsten Dunst) manages to nurture a crush on Trip (Josh Harnett), the dreamy high school football quarter back, who also has a thing for her.Trip corners Mr. Lisbon at school one day and tells him that he wishes to take Lux to the homecoming dance. Trip asserts that his intentions are honorable and that, moreover, he would ensures that all the sisters would have a date for the dance, which they could all attend together. He persuades Mr. Lisbon to discuss the possibility with his wife. She reluctantly agrees, after all, their father will be chaperoning the dance, but makes them wear girlish dresses that hang like sacks on them. Still, the girls do not let this fashion faux pas diminish their excitement about going to the homecoming dance. They do not realize that it would be the beginning of the end for them.The dance itself is a success, as Lux and Trip are crowned the homecoming dance king and queen. What starts out as a fairytale date, however, ends up a disaster, when Trip fails to bring Lux home at the appointed hour. Taking a detour to the local football field, Trip and Lux end up doing what a lot of teenagers do when they think that they are in love. It turns out to be less than idyllic and a disillusioned Lux returns home alone the next morning,  Even though the others returned home as promised, mommy dearest punishes them all, keeping them imprisoned in their home and sequestered from friends and classmates, forbidden to even attend school.As the Lisbon sisters draw in upon themselves, they become even more of a curiosity for the local teenage boys. In their eyes, these surviving Lisbon sisters are made more mysterious and alluring by their very sequestration, achieving almost iconic status. It is through them that the Lisbon girls manage to retain a semblance of a normal life, communicating with them oftentimes through the music that teenagers share over that instrument that serves to bind teenagers, the telephone. Still this is not normal congress in the context in which it occurs, and the Lisbon girls turn melancholy. Even so, however, the final denouement is sure to shock the viewer.This film is perfectly cast, and excellent, finely nuanced performances are given by the entire cast. While it is not a film that everyone will enjoy, as it is quite quirky, those who like films with a slight twist to them will enjoy this off-beat, edgy film.",4,A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH...,1111881600,"03 27, 2005",2005,3800,"['Based', 'best-selling', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'intriguing', 'film', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'daughter', 'revered', 'director', 'Francis', 'Coppola', 'fairly', 'masterful', 'job', 'indicative', 'fact', 'apple', 'not', 'have', 'fallen', 'far', 'tree', 'Ms.', 'Coppola', 'tight', 'well-nuanced', 'performances', 'stellar', 'cast', 'creating', 'interesting', 'quirky', 'little', 'gem', 'film.The', 'crux', 'film', 'place', 'mid-nineteen', 'seventies', 'suburban', 'town', 'Michigan', 'centered', 'lovely', 'Lisbon', 'sisters', 'Originally', 'five', 'number', 'one', 'header', 'out', 'window', 'successful', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'leaving', 'four', 'older', 'ones', 'continue', 'live', 'repressive', 'parents', 'suicide', 'garners', 'press', 'attention', 'Lisbon', 'sister', 'curiosity', 'local', 'teenage', 'boys', 'become', 'goddesses', 'whom', 'adolescent', 'sexual', 'curiosity', 'eyes', 'surviving', 'Lisbon', 'sisters', 'are', 'local', 'father', 'James', 'Woods', 'teacher', 'local', 'high', 'school', 'dominated', 'wife', 'Kathleen', 'Turner', 'who', 'mother', 'certain', 'failings', 'quite', 'repressive', 'instilling', 'daughters', 'intellectual', 'curiosity', 'can', 'ensure', 'become', 'stunted', 'emotionally', 'crushing', 'budding', 'sexuality', 'means', 'necessary', 'matter', 'how', 'draconian', 'Still', 'oldest', 'one', 'Lux', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'nurture', 'crush', 'Trip', 'Josh', 'Harnett', 'dreamy', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'quarter', 'back', 'who', 'also', 'thing', 'her.Trip', 'corners', 'Mr.', 'Lisbon', 'school', 'one', 'day', 'take', 'Lux', 'homecoming', 'dance', 'Trip', 'intentions', 'are', 'honorable', 'moreover', 'would', 'ensures', 'sisters', 'would', 'have', 'date', 'dance', 'could', 'attend', 'together', 'Mr.', 'Lisbon', 'discuss', 'possibility', 'wife', 'reluctantly', 'father', 'will', 'be', 'chaperoning', 'dance', 'wear', 'girlish', 'dresses', 'hang', 'sacks', 'Still', 'girls', 'do', 'not', 'let', 'fashion', 'pas', 'diminish', 'excitement', 'going', 'homecoming', 'dance', 'do', 'not', 'realize', 'would', 'be', 'beginning', 'end', 'them.The', 'dance', 'success', 'Lux', 'Trip', 'are', 'crowned', 'homecoming', 'dance', 'king', 'queen', 'What', 'out', 'fairytale', 'date', 'however', 'up', 'disaster', 'when', 'Trip', 'bring', 'Lux', 'home', 'appointed', 'hour', 'Taking', 'detour', 'local', 'football', 'field', 'Trip', 'Lux', 'end', 'up', 'doing', 'what', 'lot', 'teenagers', 'do', 'when', 'think', 'are', 'love', 'out', 'be', 'less', 'idyllic', 'disillusioned', 'Lux', 'home', 'alone', 'next', 'morning', 'Even', 'others', 'returned', 'home', 'promised', 'mommy', 'dearest', 'punishes', 'keeping', 'imprisoned', 'home', 'sequestered', 'friends', 'classmates', 'forbidden', 'even', 'attend', 'school.As', 'Lisbon', 'sisters', 'draw', 'upon', 'become', 'even', 'more', 'curiosity', 'local', 'teenage', 'boys', 'eyes', 'surviving', 'Lisbon', 'sisters', 'are', 'made', 'more', 'mysterious', 'alluring', 'very', 'sequestration', 'achieving', 'almost', 'iconic', 'status', 'Lisbon', 'girls', 'manage', 'retain', 'semblance', 'normal', 'life', 'communicating', 'music', 'teenagers', 'share', 'instrument', 'bind', 'teenagers', 'telephone', 'Still', 'not', 'normal', 'congress', 'context', 'Lisbon', 'girls', 'turn', 'melancholy', 'Even', 'so', 'however', 'final', 'denouement', 'sure', 'shock', 'viewer.This', 'film', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'excellent', 'finely', 'nuanced', 'performances', 'are', 'given', 'entire', 'cast', 'not', 'film', 'everyone', 'will', 'enjoy', 'quite', 'quirky', 'who', 'like', 'films', 'slight', 'twist', 'will', 'enjoy', 'off-beat', 'edgy', 'film']",N/A

Now, in th past, it has been said that Sofia can not act. And maybe that is true- but I'll tell you one thing- boy, can she direct!This movie follows the lives of 5 sisters- the blond Lisbon sisters- and ends with their eventual deaths. The first to go is Cecilia (played by Hannah Hall, the child actress who stunned audiences in Forest Gump), the only dark-haired one of the bunch. At the age of 13, she slits her wrists in the bathtub, but this &quot;cry for help&quot; is not taken seriously. Her next attempt, however, does her in. The Lisbon girls, all of whom are very close, begin to deteriorate after this point as they succumb to depression and grief.When the second-youngest sister (the youngest surviving), Lux, behaves in a promiscuous fashion on her prom night, Mrs. Lisbon (played by Kathleen Turner), a fanatical, religious housewife, removes all of her girls from school and secludes them in their rooms. Already depressed, the girls no longer have anything to tie them to the world and their peers and more or less give up.Now, this movie could've easily become cliched and trite, but Coppola manages to keep it fresh, realistic and poignant, with all of the emotion of a veteran director. The soundtrack is melancholy and engaging, and provides a great backdrop for the pastoral suburbia and azure skies dotted by cumulus clouds. Girly bedrooms and teen angst.

Fortunately, Coppola doesn't sell out and over-explain things for a general audience. Unfortunately, I know there will be a lot of people who don't get this movie as a result. That's too bad, because they're missing a gem. I highly recommend this movie.

Once the Virgin Suicides was over, I was done with it completely.  All in all, it was kind of boring.  The only interesting part was when the girls killed themselves and the country club people had the asphixiation party.  The acting was mediocre and the movie focused more on cinematography than anything else.  To me, this film is GenX camp and if you like that, then by all means watch this movie.  My suggestion is to go watch Picnic if you really want to see a wierd, artsy movie about mysterious girls.  Mysterious does not describe Kirsten Dunst.

I figured I would see the movie as well.  Overall; it's an ok movie.  Sofia made some changes probably due to the theme but some things she either left out or shouldn't have changed.The biggest thing missing was the complete collapse of the household.  Both the family and the house fell apart.  The family gave up on just about everything.  You did not see the yard overgrowing; the roof falling apart; the great amount of trash in the house and the left-over rotten food on the floors.  The fact the mother stopped cooking and cleaning which made the girls fend for themselves by eating out of cans and washing their own cloths in the tub. Gone are the fish flies which were not cleaned up during the time and added to dilapidation of the house.Cecilia who was a shadow of her former self came across as simply a shy girl.  In the book her empty shell appearance added to the stories of being a crazy and gave the gossipy neighbors a reason for why she killed herself.Mary who survived her suicide for a month; didn't in the movie.Mr and Mrs Lisbon who disappeared in the middle of the night; left in daylight.One thing Eugenides did in the book was that he really didn't give a clear answer to why the girls committed suicide.

524750,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00003CXH0,Matthew Horner,"[2, 3]","Sophia Coppola, who's deficiencies as an actress marred The Godfather III, made the right decision when she decided her real talents lay behind the camera. She became a director like her father, Francis Ford Coppola. Her first directorial effort, The Virgin Suicides, is not a highly commercial effort. Simply consider its title. It is, however, a good film and a very promising debut. I think we will hear a lot more from Ms. Coppola.I have, as usual, written something about the plot, but it may not tell you much. The Virgin Suicides is perhaps best described as an allegory. What it appears to be about is not necessarily what it is really about.Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon [James Woods and Kathleen Turner] have five beautiful teenage daughters. They live in an ordinary upper-middle class house in a pristine upper-middle class neighborhood, the kind where debutantes and coming out parties abound. The Lisbon family is torn apart are when the youngest girl attempts suicide, then shattered when her second attempt succeeds. Meanwhile, the local boys are both enamored with and in awe of the Lisbon girls, who represent the sort of ideal that only the innocence of youth can conjure up. The boys are as confused and distraught by the event as anyone else, but their perceptions of the tragedy and its meaning are necessarily quite different from the adults. The straight-laced Lisbons decide to withdraw the other girls from school, but at the urging of a psychiatrist, allow the girls to invite the boys to a party. It is the one and only the girls will ever be allowed to give.The time is the 1970s, and I think this is important to know because that is when the sexual revolution really took hold in the middle class. Many parents and their children became separated by a kind of invisible wall. The values had shifted too rapidly between one generation and the next. The love didn't necessarily die, but the lines of communication often went missing. This is not to say that The Virgin Suicides is about rebellion. It is about the loss of innocence.Because of what happens to them, the movie might seem to be all about the Lisbon girls. I think it is as much about the boys, from whose viewpoint the story is told. Ms. Coppola has elicited strong performances from her cast, many of which are very young. Kirsten Dunst and Josh Harnett are extraordinary as the oldest of the teenagers. We have come to expect the best from Dunst, who first amazed us as Claudia, the child vampire in Interview With the Vampire. It is wonderful to see her moving so easily into more adult roles. Harnett is a pleasant surprise. His previous work has been mainly in low-budget, crowd-pleasing horror movies, in which it is hard to discern if the actors have talent or not.The Virgin Suicides is based on a remarkable and sparse novel by Jeffrey Eugenidas. Ms. Coppola took on a daunting task for her first film. The book has minimal character development, but the young director was able to give some character insights without compromising the spirit of the book. This is not a movie for the easily distracted. Big mass market entertainments do all the work for the audience. Films like The Virgin Suicides do not, and, to me, this is part of what makes them so interesting.Rated R for strong thematic elements involving teens.

At times, THE VIRGIN SUICIDES had the feel of a Paul Thomas Anderson film with the occasional lazy edits and contrived dialogue; also a dash of David Lynch. I was also disappointed by the performances of James Woods and Kathleen Turner as the parents -- clearly these were disturbed parents, but their portrayals were shockingly remote and one dimensional. Come to think of it, much of the acting in this film felt dreamlike and a bit too flat -- partly intentional I'm sure ... but just how much? The first 2/3 of the movie satisfyingly built up the haunting mystique that I was expecting largely due to Kirsten Dunst's portrayal of the ravishingly enigmatic Lux Lisbon, but everything seemed to unravel after the high school dance sequence.

These come from Kirsten Dunst (as doomed and lovely Lux Lisbon), estremely good James Woods, and in a look-again performance, an unbelievably deglamorized Kathleen Turner. Oters that deserve mention are Noah Shebib (as Parkie Denton), Hayden Chritensen (whom will soon be seen in Episode II) and Hanna Hall as Cecilia Lisbon, the opener of the way.Another remarkable aspect of the film is that it is the directorial debut by Sofia Coppola, reviled by many for her less-than-stellar performance in Godfather III. It is amazing the rapport of sensitivity with this material established by her as a director with many ideas and visions.Like its source, the acclaimed novel by Jeffrey Eugenides, the story focuses on the lives and eventual deaths of the legendary five Lisbon sisters (Mary, Therese, Bonaventure -- aka &quot;Bonnie&quot;- Cecilia and Lux) growing up in an elegant, tree-lined upper-class suburban enclave near Detroit, circa 1975. They are fabulously beautiful, yet oddly repressed by their well-meaning but stifling parents.In more ways than one, the Lisbon girls become a some sort of single entity, and with the spectacular suicide of the youngest sibling, they take a step in a strange direction that will transform them into history for a group of boys in the neighborhood, who, in their adult years, keep their obsession alive.In a more mundane aspect, we have the seeds of tragedy sown in a most commonplace way, and yet it is disturbing for it has happened to many of us before. Lux, the most beautiful and free-spirited of the sisters, attracts the most popular jock from their private school, Trip Fontaine (a lukewarm Josh Hartnett), who has all the wrong reasons to &quot;woo&quot; her, pulling the touching stunt (but nevertheless, a stunt) of having his chums as support to take Lux &amp; Co. to the Homecoming Dance.The party (which provides a nostalgia look as the Carrie prom gone ok), is in a way the catalyst for the tragedy that'll ensue.There are many reasons to watch again this film; Sofia Coppola's assured touch on human relations and the reaction upon the screen; it also features Kirsten Dunst's best performance to date, Kathleen Turner's turn as a character actor, and the superb recreation of &quot;Stepford Country&quot;.Definitely one of the year's best, a top-drawer recommendation.",5,70s Gothic yet utterly tender...  you won't forget it,978307200,"01 1, 2001",2001,2645,"[""'The"", 'Virgin', 'Suicides', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'underrated', 'films', 'past', 'year.It', 'most', 'tragic', 'drama', 'punctuated', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'just-right', 'reproduction', 'mid', 'featuring', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'mainly', 'young', 'then-little-known', 'cast', 'filled', 'fresh', 'come', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'doomed', 'lovely', 'Lux', 'Lisbon', 'estremely', 'good', 'James', 'Woods', 'look-again', 'performance', 'unbelievably', 'deglamorized', 'Kathleen', 'Turner', 'Oters', 'deserve', 'mention', 'are', 'Noah', 'Shebib', 'Parkie', 'Denton', 'Hayden', 'Chritensen', 'whom', 'will', 'soon', 'be', 'seen', 'Episode', 'II', 'Hanna', 'Hall', 'Cecilia', 'Lisbon', 'opener', 'way.Another', 'remarkable', 'aspect', 'film', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'reviled', 'many', 'less-than-stellar', 'performance', 'Godfather', 'III', 'amazing', 'rapport', 'sensitivity', 'material', 'established', 'director', 'many', 'ideas', 'visions.Like', 'source', 'acclaimed', 'novel', 'Jeffrey', 'Eugenides', 'story', 'lives', 'eventual', 'deaths', 'legendary', 'five', 'Lisbon', 'sisters', 'Mary', 'Therese', 'Bonaventure', 'aka', 'quot', 'Bonnie', 'quot', 'Cecilia', 'Lux', 'growing', 'up', 'elegant', 'tree-lined', 'upper-class', 'suburban', 'enclave', 'Detroit', 'circa', '1975', 'are', 'fabulously', 'beautiful', 'yet', 'oddly', 'repressed', 'well-meaning', 'stifling', 'parents.In', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'Lisbon', 'become', 'sort', 'single', 'entity', 'spectacular', 'suicide', 'youngest', 'sibling', 'take', 'step', 'strange', 'direction', 'will', 'transform', 'history', 'group', 'boys', 'neighborhood', 'who', 'adult', 'years', 'keep', 'obsession', 'more', 'mundane', 'aspect', 'have', 'seeds', 'tragedy', 'sown', 'most', 'commonplace', 'way', 'yet', 'disturbing', 'happened', 'many', 'Lux', 'most', 'beautiful', 'free-spirited', 'sisters', 'most', 'popular', 'jock', 'private', 'school', 'Trip', 'Fontaine', 'lukewarm', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'who', 'wrong', 'reasons', 'quot', 'quot', 'pulling', 'touching', 'stunt', 'nevertheless', 'stunt', 'having', 'chums', 'support', 'take', 'Lux', 'amp', 'Co.', 'Homecoming', 'Dance.The', 'party', 'nostalgia', 'look', 'Carrie', 'prom', 'gone', 'ok', 'way', 'catalyst', 'tragedy', ""'ll"", 'ensue.There', 'are', 'many', 'reasons', 'watch', 'again', 'film', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'assured', 'touch', 'human', 'relations', 'reaction', 'screen', 'also', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'best', 'performance', 'date', 'Kathleen', 'Turner', 'turn', 'character', 'actor', 'superb', 'recreation', 'quot', 'Stepford', 'Country', 'quot', '.Definitely', 'one', 'year', 'best', 'top-drawer', 'recommendation']",N/A
524754,APN6DO7VHDLTN,B00003CXH0,Missing Person,"[10, 17]","""The Virgin Suicides"", directed by Sofia Coppola (daughter of Francis Ford Coppola), is an extremely tedious movie-watching experience that leaves you wondering what the hell the genuine point is.Basically the entire movie is seen as a flashback and takes place in the mid-1970s.  It's about 4 neighborhood boys who become entranced by the 5 Lisbon sisters.  All of the sisters ultimately commit suicide while in their teens.  Spoken narrations crop up throughout from one of the boys who I'm presuming is supposed to be an adult by now, but the guy sounds like he's in his late teens/ early 20s.  The spoken voiceovers are toothless and run circles around themselves again and again. And with the exception of James Woods, the acting is mostly unremarkable as well.  For whatever reason, Josh Hartnett seems to be widely considered some kind of supreme hunk, and that's presumably the only reason he's in this movie--his role here is a joke and seems like it's randomly inserted into the film to give it more appeal to teenage girls.To go along with the time period in which the movie takes place, there are a number of terrific, if extremely familiar, '70s songs included such as Todd Rundgren's ""Hello It's Me"" and 10cc's ""I'm Not In Love"".  Unfortunately, the Hollies' screechy, sappy ballad ""The Air That I Breathe"" also appears.  Even ""I'm Not In Love"", as great as it is, works far better on its own terms as a brilliant atmospheric song than it does in the context of this ill-conceived movie.We learn at the beginning of the film that these 4 boys are unable to free themselves of their obsession with the Lisbon girls no matter how much time passes.  At the end of the movie, the message is that that these 4 boys are unable to free themselves of their obsession with the Lisbon girls no matter how much time passes--in other words, the same damn thing.  And it's mind-boggling how little happens in between.  There isn't even any quality black humor anywhere to be found.Even the title is crass--I mean, Lux Lisbon, played by Kirsten Dunst, isn't even a virgin by the time she offs herself.  At least ""The Lisbon Suicides"" would have been more appropriate.There are occasional resonating bits, the most memorable part being where the guys and girls play songs back and forth to each other over the phone to communicate their feelings.  Otherwise, there's really nothing to recommend this movie at all.  It's hard to even make it through the entire thing, and when you finally do, you feel like you've been taken for a sucker.Sofia would subsequently do far better work with ""Lost In Translation"".",2,a 10 minute premise stretched into a 90+ minute movie,1132358400,"11 19, 2005",2005,2607,"['Virgin', 'Suicides', 'directed', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'daughter', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'extremely', 'tedious', 'movie-watching', 'experience', 'wondering', 'what', 'hell', 'genuine', 'point', 'is.Basically', 'entire', 'movie', 'seen', 'flashback', 'place', 'mid-1970s', '4', 'neighborhood', 'boys', 'who', 'become', 'entranced', '5', 'Lisbon', 'sisters', 'sisters', 'ultimately', 'commit', 'suicide', 'teens', 'Spoken', 'narrations', 'crop', 'up', 'one', 'boys', 'who', ""'m"", 'presuming', 'supposed', 'be', 'adult', 'now', 'guy', 'sounds', 'late', 'teens/', 'early', '20s', 'spoken', 'voiceovers', 'are', 'toothless', 'run', 'circles', 'again', 'again', 'exception', 'James', 'Woods', 'acting', 'mostly', 'unremarkable', 'as', 'well', 'reason', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'be', 'widely', 'considered', 'kind', 'supreme', 'hunk', 'presumably', 'only', 'reason', 'movie', 'role', 'here', 'joke', 'randomly', 'inserted', 'film', 'give', 'more', 'appeal', 'teenage', 'girls.To', 'go', 'time', 'period', 'movie', 'place', 'are', 'number', 'terrific', 'extremely', 'familiar', ""'70s"", 'songs', 'included', 'such', 'Todd', 'Rundgren', 'Hello', 'Me', '10cc', ""'m"", 'Not', 'Love', 'Unfortunately', 'Hollies', 'screechy', 'sappy', 'ballad', 'Air', 'Breathe', 'also', 'Even', ""'m"", 'Not', 'Love', 'as', 'great', 'far', 'better', 'own', 'terms', 'brilliant', 'atmospheric', 'song', 'context', 'ill-conceived', 'movie.We', 'learn', 'beginning', 'film', '4', 'boys', 'are', 'unable', 'free', 'obsession', 'Lisbon', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'time', 'passes', 'end', 'movie', 'message', '4', 'boys', 'are', 'unable', 'free', 'obsession', 'Lisbon', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'time', 'passes', 'other', 'words', 'same', 'damn', 'thing', 'mind-boggling', 'how', 'little', ""n't"", 'even', 'quality', 'black', 'humor', 'anywhere', 'be', 'found.Even', 'title', 'crass', 'mean', 'Lux', 'Lisbon', 'played', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', ""n't"", 'even', 'virgin', 'time', 'least', 'Lisbon', 'Suicides', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'appropriate.There', 'are', 'occasional', 'resonating', 'bits', 'most', 'memorable', 'part', 'being', 'where', 'guys', 'girls', 'play', 'songs', 'back', 'forth', 'other', 'phone', 'communicate', 'feelings', 'Otherwise', 'really', 'nothing', 'recommend', 'movie', 'hard', 'even', 'make', 'entire', 'thing', 'when', 'finally', 'do', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'been', 'taken', 'sucker.Sofia', 'would', 'subsequently', 'do', 'far', 'better', 'work', 'Lost', 'Translation']",N/A

Keep in mind that the narrator tells this tale in first person plural. You can tell that he and his friends are adults now and are trying to piece together what happened during that tragic time and yet at the same time you can tell the lot of them are haunted. The tale is thus a filtered memory of what happened. 70s music rules and adds to a lot of the scenes, especially one of the best when the girls are all grounded and the boys put on records so that the girls can hear music (their mother ends up burning or locking their music away). As the Lisbon Family life unravels the neighborhood gossips but lacks the initiative to interfere in a helping manner. To most of them the Lisbon Family is one of perfection and it's probably too hard for them to comprehend otherwise so they spin around in a state of confusion. The cast is otherwise impressive. Kathleen Turner and James Woods play the parents. Danny DeVito has a small role as the therapist of the girls. Josh Hartnett is the high school heartthrob who courts Dunst's character, a young Hayden Christensen is one of the mesmerized lads, A.J. Cook is Mary Lisbon and Scott Glenn is the community priest.

Although hers was no Meryl Streep or Nicole Kidman performance, she was not as bad as all the critics, bar none, saw her.Yet the damage was done, and everybody thought that the name Sofia Coppola will never again be on any other movie credits, let alone be credited as the writer and director. To everyone's surprise, comes Virgin Suicides,(her first long feature after the short Lick the Star)a fine film, although no classic,but it shows that talent must truly be flowing in the blood of the Coppolas!Sofia Coppola was able with Virgin Suicides to demonstrate a good narrative and a fine eye for the visual, a making of a good director.The story of the film itself (adapted  from the Jefferey Euginedes novel, but written by Ms Coppola), is amibigious, and the suicides of the Lisbon girls, remains shrouded with mystery.(the novel is alledgedly based on factual accounts).This atmosphere remains throughout the film, despite the clues that are sporadically spread throughout. A religious and strict mother,less psychotic version of Piper Laurie in Carrie but as effectively fanatic,(a great comeback by Katheleen Turner), a gullible and weird Math teacher father (the great James Woods), they are over protective of their five beautiful daughters, the youngest of whom inexplicablly commits suicide early in the film. The mystery of the Lisbon household is overblown through the eyes of the boys who are intrigued, fascinated and perplexed by the girls and their lives. Yet the scenes in the prom dance, restores a air of normality, and we see for the first time the Lisbon girls as normal teenagers with strict parents. As a result the plot becomes slightly uneven, as this air of mystery which carried the film loses its grip, only to return with their mass suicide.I liked the mood of the film,in parts the Lisbon girls' mystery reminding me a bit of Peter Weir's masterpiece Picnic at Hanging Rock.All the actors are well cast, from Kathleen Turner, James Woods, Kristen Dunst (in my opinion it is her best role to date, she brings a lot of elusive charm and seductiveness to her role), Hanna R.Hall (who does a fantastic job in the yet to be released drama Amy and Isabelle), to the delightful cameos by Danny Devito and Michael Pare.The soundtrack is also brilliant, and the choice of the French ambient duo Air to do the score was an inspiring choice.So Virgin Suicides is as I said, no classic film, and it has its flaws, but overall it is an above average film that will compel you to watch in fascination.Sofia has surely the last laugh!",4,The Last Laugh,1058659200,"07 20, 2003",2003,2646,"['was', 'actress', 'recent', 'memory', 'was', 'more', 'vilified', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'Godfather', '3', 'hers', 'was', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'performance', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'critics', 'bar', 'none', 'saw', 'damage', 'was', 'done', 'everybody', 'thought', 'name', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'will', 'never', 'again', 'be', 'other', 'movie', 'credits', 'let', 'alone', 'be', 'credited', 'writer', 'director', 'everyone', 'surprise', 'Virgin', 'Suicides', 'first', 'long', 'feature', 'short', 'Lick', 'Star', 'fine', 'film', 'classic', 'talent', 'must', 'truly', 'be', 'flowing', 'blood', 'Coppolas', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'was', 'able', 'Virgin', 'Suicides', 'demonstrate', 'good', 'narrative', 'fine', 'eye', 'visual', 'making', 'good', 'director.The', 'story', 'film', 'adapted', 'Jefferey', 'Euginedes', 'novel', 'written', 'Ms', 'Coppola', 'amibigious', 'suicides', 'Lisbon', 'girls', 'shrouded', 'mystery', 'novel', 'alledgedly', 'based', 'factual', 'accounts', '.This', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'clues', 'are', 'sporadically', 'spread', 'religious', 'strict', 'mother', 'less', 'psychotic', 'version', 'Piper', 'Laurie', 'Carrie', 'effectively', 'fanatic', 'great', 'comeback', 'Katheleen', 'Turner', 'gullible', 'weird', 'Math', 'teacher', 'father', 'great', 'James', 'Woods', 'are', 'protective', 'five', 'beautiful', 'daughters', 'youngest', 'whom', 'inexplicablly', 'suicide', 'early', 'film', 'mystery', 'Lisbon', 'household', 'overblown', 'eyes', 'boys', 'who', 'are', 'intrigued', 'fascinated', 'perplexed', 'girls', 'lives', 'scenes', 'prom', 'dance', 'air', 'normality', 'see', 'first', 'time', 'Lisbon', 'girls', 'normal', 'teenagers', 'strict', 'parents', 'result', 'plot', 'slightly', 'uneven', 'air', 'mystery', 'carried', 'film', 'grip', 'only', 'return', 'mass', 'suicide.I', 'liked', 'mood', 'film', 'parts', 'Lisbon', 'girls', 'mystery', 'reminding', 'bit', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'masterpiece', 'Picnic', 'Hanging', 'Rock.All', 'actors', 'are', 'well', 'cast', 'Kathleen', 'Turner', 'James', 'Woods', 'Kristen', 'Dunst', 'opinion', 'best', 'role', 'date', 'lot', 'elusive', 'charm', 'seductiveness', 'role', 'Hanna', 'R.Hall', 'who', 'fantastic', 'job', 'yet', 'be', 'released', 'drama', 'Amy', 'Isabelle', 'delightful', 'cameos', 'Danny', 'Devito', 'Michael', 'Pare.The', 'soundtrack', 'also', 'brilliant', 'choice', 'French', 'ambient', 'duo', 'Air', 'do', 'score', 'was', 'inspiring', 'choice.So', 'Virgin', 'Suicides', 'said', 'classic', 'film', 'flaws', 'overall', 'above', 'average', 'film', 'will', 'compel', 'watch', 'fascination.Sofia', 'surely', 'last', 'laugh']",N/A

It takes a difficult subject in teenage subject and manages to turn it into something not only tragic but beautiful and sometimes even gently humorous.  This is a turn away from teen movies in that it is completely unconventional.  It is an adult drama that is poignant and evocative.  The movie starts as it means to continue, with a visually arresting suicide attempt of Cecelia Lisbon, a 13 year-old girl.  The Lisbon sisters are a group of five girls that, during the 1970's, haunted and mesmerised the neighbourhood boys.  Put basically, this is a study of sexual awakening and innocence.One obviously noticeable thing about 'The Virgin Suicides' is the acting.  Kathleen Turner and James Woods play the restrictive parents of the sisters, and kudos should go to Turner for giving an unsentimental turn in a highly difficult role; she pulls it off perfectly.  Kirsten Dunst, the rising star of her generation, is the more prominent of the sisters, Lux as she romances Trip Fontaine (Josh Hartnett).  After a great deal of effort, the girls get to go to the school prom and experience the teenage life that they have been left out of so long.With the subtle yet engrossing romantic plot, you'd be forgiven if you forgot the shadow that Cecelia's death casts over the proceedings.  The girls seem fine, almost unaltered, but the mysterious beauty and innocence of the sisters continues to haunt the dreams of the neighbourhood boys.  The central irony of wanting to get closer to the girls yet wanting them to remain perfect is well realised and show what an assured directorial debut this is, possibly the best since Sam Mendes's 'American Beauty'.",5,Not a teen movie!,1011484800,"01 20, 2002",2002,1744,"['solid', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'Jeffrey', 'Eugenides', 'book', 'as', 'good', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'difficult', 'subject', 'teenage', 'subject', 'turn', 'something', 'not', 'only', 'tragic', 'beautiful', 'sometimes', 'even', 'gently', 'humorous', 'turn', 'away', 'teen', 'movies', 'completely', 'unconventional', 'adult', 'drama', 'poignant', 'evocative', 'movie', 'continue', 'visually', 'arresting', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'Cecelia', 'Lisbon', '13', 'year-old', 'girl', 'Lisbon', 'sisters', 'are', 'group', 'five', 'girls', '1970', 'haunted', 'mesmerised', 'neighbourhood', 'boys', 'Put', 'basically', 'study', 'sexual', 'awakening', 'innocence.One', 'obviously', 'noticeable', 'thing', ""'The"", 'Virgin', 'Suicides', 'acting', 'Kathleen', 'Turner', 'James', 'Woods', 'play', 'restrictive', 'parents', 'sisters', 'kudos', 'should', 'go', 'Turner', 'giving', 'unsentimental', 'turn', 'highly', 'difficult', 'role', 'off', 'perfectly', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'rising', 'star', 'generation', 'more', 'prominent', 'sisters', 'Lux', 'Trip', 'Fontaine', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'great', 'deal', 'effort', 'girls', 'get', 'go', 'school', 'prom', 'experience', 'teenage', 'life', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'so', 'long.With', 'subtle', 'yet', 'engrossing', 'romantic', 'plot', ""'d"", 'be', 'forgiven', 'forgot', 'shadow', 'Cecelia', 'death', 'casts', 'proceedings', 'girls', 'seem', 'fine', 'almost', 'unaltered', 'mysterious', 'beauty', 'innocence', 'sisters', 'haunt', 'dreams', 'neighbourhood', 'boys', 'central', 'irony', 'wanting', 'get', 'closer', 'girls', 'yet', 'wanting', 'remain', 'perfect', 'well', 'realised', 'show', 'what', 'assured', 'directorial', 'debut', 'possibly', 'best', 'Sam', 'Mendes', ""'American"", 'Beauty']",N/A

I believe she is an over-rated director whose films are looked upon as deep and meaningful, while they are in fact quite shallow and pointless. Such was the case with ""The Virgin Suicides"".The film revolves around four (or was it five?) good-looking sisters, who live in a very religious household and see suicide as their only escape from the shelter they've been put into. The story is told through the eyes of the neighborhood boys, who lust after these girls, but feel as if they don't know anything about these mysterious creatures.The problem is, neither do we. The fact that I can't even remember how many of the sisters there were tells something - except for Lux, played by Kirsten Dunst, these girls are just there to fill the frame, and they have no characteristics or background stories. The first half hour of the film starts promising, with the death of the youngest sister, but after that, there is another hour or so of nothing. There is this guy, played by Josh Hartnett, who is in love with Lux, and then the movie is filled with tedious scenes that seem to go on forever... It is clear from the start that these girls are depressed because of the repressing environment they are growing up in, but the movie doesn't go anywhere from there.I honestly do not understand why anyone would like this movie. What offended me the most was how pretentious it was. The only good thing about this film is Kirsten Dunst, who is gorgeous and exploited to the maximum - there are countless scenes of her in slow motion, waving, shaking her hair, winking, etc. It is a pleasure to see just how much the camera love sher - but you might as well just look at the DVD cover for hours and feel the same thing.

For me the part that made me cry was when Lux`s mother forced her to burn her rock albums, but that`s just me. Then there was the part where Trip and Lux fell asleep in the football field together on the night of their homecoming dance and he left her there, explaining in his POV that to this day he doesn`t know why he did but something just felt wrong. I`ve kind of felt that way before, when something just felt wrong about a situation and I didn`t know what, and I abandoned people without even knowing why. It`s a horrible feeling and the movie captured that mood of dissapointment very well. The film`s very moody and in way aggressively tear-jerking in simply the style of it.

Some may cringe at the thought since her acting debut in The Godfather Part III was roundly bashed.  One cannot say the same about this movie though.  Ms. Coppola does a fine job behind the camera.  The problem with the film is not her directing, but the overall plot.  The story revolves around the Lisbon family which is made up of five daughters.  They seem to be a happy family, but they are shaken up by the suicide of one of the daughters. The film takes place in the late 70's, but is told in flashback style narrated by Giovanni Risbisi.  His voice is that of one of four boys who are fascinated to the point of obsession with the Lisbon girls.  After the one daughter's suicide, the girls' fanatical mother, played with fervor by Kathleen Turner, basically shuts the remaining daughters off from the world.  This makes the girls all the more mysterious and attractive. Kirsten Dunst play Lux Lisbon, the most rebellious and sought after girl.  Josh Harnett plays Trip Fontaine, the most popular boy in school who wins her affections.  After the girls go to the homecoming dance, Trip and Lux have an encounter on the football field and Lux doesn't come home until the next morning.  This prompts their mother to banish the girls to their room, not even aloud to be let out to go to school.  They start trading messages over the phone and through morse code to the group of boys across the street.  The movie ends in disturbing fashion.

It masterfully combines visual and music elements into magnificent coming-of-age (of sorts) film that shouldn't be missed.Sofia Coppola's directorial debut shows great promise for the daughter of the great director with the same last name. She weaves her story splendidly around five religiously repressed teenage girls and the boys who were driven crazy by their beauty. Useing music and minor camera tricks to convey the intense emotion behind the turbulent teenage years, she shows how five girls' suicides forever changed the world of these boys. And Coppola knows how to direct her actors as well. The excellent ensemble cast, including James Woods, Kirsten Dunst and Josh Hartnet, all give solid performances. Kathleen Turner especially shines as the girls' overly religious mother who forbids any potentially sinful social situations.Towards the end of the film, there is one particularly magical scene after the girls are no longer allowed to leave the home, and they reach out from their prison to the boys next door by calling them up and playing music over the phone. In a fantastic montage, we watch as they perform this emotional support back and forth. No words, just music to express their feelings. It's one of those scenes that sticks with you long after you've seen the film.The Virgin Suicides is a film I can't recommend highly enough.

524771,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00003CXH0,Reviewer,"[14, 19]","This is a film about moments in life.  Some are so horrible you just want to forget them, but can't; others-- and they are rare-- are perfect, but they don't last.  First time director Sofia Coppola, who also wrote the screenplay, based on the novel by Jeffrey Eugenides, captures the essence of those moments in ""The Virgin Suicides,"" which is much more than ""just"" a film.  It's a poem.  And it's devastating.  The story is told from the collective point of view of four young men, friends since childhood, who twenty years later are still trying to put together the pieces of a puzzle and make some sense of what happened those many years ago.  All they know, even now, is that the five Lisbon girls were their friends, and then they were gone.  And as you watch the story unfold-- like those boys-now-men who can't forget-- you wonder how such a thing could happen, as well.Coppola (daughter of Francis Ford Coppola) makes a strong case for the science of genetics, as her debut behind the camera as writer/director is nothing less than brilliant.  She does everything to perfection.  She knows her characters inside and out and how to best bring them to life.  And the film is so lyrically presented.  With her camera, she captures the beauty of nature, as well as the beauty that can be found in the mundane, everyday things that make up a life, using music and the juxtaposition of images to optimum effect.  Tragedy born of ugliness is one thing, but when tragic events are so poetically rendered, it's like an overwhelming darkness loosed upon the world from the abyss, which blots out the nurturing light of the Sun.  And that's what Coppola has done with this film.  She leads you through the beauty to find the beast; and though you know what's coming, the impact of it all is still staggering.Central to the story is Lux, second youngest of the five teenagers, a character wonderfully realized by the talented Kirsten Dunst, whose angst is something to which everyone who has ever been a teenager will be able to relate.  Repressed and sheltered, she nevertheless manages to express that spark of life roiling just beneath the surface and begging to be freed.  Dunst plays her from deep within, with a richly textured performance that is right on the money.  And as Cecilia, the youngest of the sisters, Hanna R. Hall gives a notable performance that is poignant and introspective, which underscores the foreboding that establishes the underlying tone of the film.Excellent, also, as the other three sisters, are A.J. Cook (Mary), Chelse Swain (Bonnie) and Leslie Hayman (Therese).  Coppola exacts memorable performances from each of them, and the casting of this film was terrific.  Physically, it is easy to believe these five are sisters; and one especially-- Hayman-- bears a striking resemblance to Kathleen Turner, who plays Mrs. Lisbon.As the mother of the doomed girls, Kathleen Turner turns in a performance fraught with subtle indications to the real key behind the mystery of the suicides:  The ever present cross she wears around her neck, her actions following an especially spirited sermon at Mass one Sunday, and the religious icons present throughout the house, which combined with Mrs. Lisbon's attitudes are very telling in themselves.  She epitomizes the overprotective parent in her futile attempts to shelter her girls from the world.  That she loves them is never in question; the reasons behind her extreme position in their regard, however, is.  Are her actions really for ""their own good,"" or for hers?  Is her overprotection of them due to the fact that she doesn't want anything untoward to happen to them for their sake, or is it because she couldn't bear it herself?  In the end, who is she really protecting?  Looking beautiful, but rather matronly-- as befits the character-- Turner does an exemplary job of bring Mrs. Lisbon to life.  She is the pivotal character of the film, and she makes the most of it with an extremely credible performance.As Mr. Lisbon, James Woods gives an affecting performance with his portrayal of a loving husband and father whose position is never quite certain; he acquiesces to Mrs. Lisbon on just about everything, but does have at least one moment when he is able to reason with his wife on the girls' behalf and prevail.  Ultimately, however, it becomes a pivotal moment that leads to tragic consequences.  But Woods plays it well, taking a rather middle-of-the-road stance with his character, who retreats into his work as a math teacher when life gets too close.The supporting cast includes Josh Hartnett (Trip), Michael Pare (Adult Trip), Scott Glenn (Father Moody), Danny DeVito (Dr. Horniker), Jonathan Tucker (Tim), Anthony DeSimone (Chase), Lee Kagan (David), Noah Shebib (Parkie) and Joe Dinicol (Dominic).  Coppola's film is a taste of what it must be like to be a young girl, growing up in a repressive environment and laden with the reasonless guilt of a self-serving mother who finds sin even in innocence.  ""The Virgin Suicides"" is a brilliant, thought provoking film that makes a profound statement about the artifice of love and the inability to recognize denial in oneself, especially in a parent who seeks to protect, perhaps, only to assuage personal fear.  A powerful, beautiful film, and without question one of the best of the year (2000).",5,Through Beauty to the Beast,990576000,"05 23, 2001",2001,5339,"['film', 'moments', 'life', 'are', 'so',

Not necessarily a coming of age story, but a great insight into what adolescent girls' minds can do when pushed to certain limits.The book-to-film adaptation is particularly good, especially since this is not a simple, linear story to be told. However, Sofia Coppola (yes, Francis Ford's daughter, Nic Cage's and Jason Schwartzman's cousin) succeeds in both her screeplay writing and in her direction. The 1970's setting of the film is subtle but truly realistic, this is how life in that era was like.The basis of the story is the life of the five Lisbon sisters, Lux (Kirsten Dunst), Mary, Cecilia, Therese and Bonnie. Living with their oppresive parents (Kathleen Turner and James Woods, in a very subdued performance), the girls are kept from the outside world, being forbidden to go to parties and socialize. This makes them even more desirable and mysterious to high school boys, who see them as godesses.Their life is disrupted by Cecilia's suicide on the very night that their parents allowed them to have a party at home. Becoming truly disturbed by this event, their mothers decides to seclude them completely, leaving the house only to go to school.Throughout the movie, we join a few of the boys as they meet and talk about what they think the sisters are doing, what they're like, dreaming of chance meetings with them, only to be used by them for the film's climactic ending.All in all, this is a great film by a great filmmaker...",5,A hidden jewel...,1052870400,"05 14, 2003",2003,1638,"['film', 'phenomenal', 'adaptation', 'Jeffrey', 'Eugenides', 'novel', 'five', 'Lisbon', 'sisters', 'subject', 'dreams', 'desire', 'boys', 'school', 'strict', 'parents', 'Not', 'necessarily', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'great', 'insight', 'what', 'adolescent', 'girls', 'minds', 'can', 'do', 'when', 'pushed', 'certain', 'limits.The', 'book-to-film', 'adaptation', 'particularly', 'good', 'especially', 'not', 'simple', 'linear', 'story', 'be', 'told', 'However', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'yes', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'daughter', 'Nic', 'Cage', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'cousin', 'screeplay', 'writing', 'direction', '1970', 'setting', 'film', 'subtle', 'truly', 'realistic', 'how', 'life', 'era', 'was', 'like.The', 'basis', 'story', 'life', 'five', 'Lisbon', 'sisters', 'Lux', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Mary', 'Cecilia', 'Therese', 'Bonnie', 'Living', 'oppresive', 'parents', 'Kathleen', 'Turner', 'James', 'Woods', 'very', 'subdued', 'performance', 'girls', 'are', 'kept', 'outside', 'world', 'being', 'forbidden', 'go', 'parties', 'socialize', 'even', 'more', 'desirable', 'mysterious', 'high', 'school', 'boys', 'who', 'see', 'godesses.Their', 'life', 'disrupted', 'Cecilia', 'suicide', 'very', 'night', 'parents', 'allowed', 'have', 'party', 'home', 'Becoming', 'truly', 'disturbed', 'event', 'mothers', 'decides', 'seclude', 'completely', 'leaving', 'house', 'only', 'go', 'school.Throughout', 'movie', 'join', 'few', 'boys', 'meet', 'talk', 'what', 'think', 'sisters', 'are', 'doing', 'what', ""'re"", 'dreaming', 'chance', 'meetings', 'only', 'be', 'used', 'film', 'climactic', 'ending.All', 'great', 'film', 'great', 'filmmaker']",N/A

I challenge anyone who believes that to see this movie.  Because of its quietly sad plot with brief moments of happiness, this movie shows a very real image of the life of a group of girls just coming-of-age in a repressive lifestyle.  5 sisters live with their parents, who restrict the girls lives so much that the youngest, at the age of twelve, attempts to commit suicide.  Believing that their youngest daughter simply needs to meet the &quot;right&quot; kind of young gentlemen, the parents of the girls throw a party, inviting neighbor boys who happen to be in love with the girls.  This having the opposite result than intended, the youngest daughter successfully kills herself.  Her suicide starts a year of tragedy, first love, and heartbreak for the four surviving sisters, leading to complete and total oblivion.  Told in flashback by the boys in love with the sisters, this story touches you in many ways because it seems so real.  We were there, we saw it happen, we remember everything.  Why?  Because we all went through it, everyone who was a teenager.  The wonderful acting, direction, and screenplay blend to make a movie that haunts you, doesn't let you go.

524781,AEM0D3OFOR9RQ,B00003CXH0,Sara,"[8, 10]","At first glance, this film doesn't seem like much. The video box features only a close-up of Kirsten Dunst, which while attracting attention from males, doesn't really show anything about the film. Once I had actually commenced with watching the film I was completely blown away. I'm a teenager myself, and while I have never considered suicide, I could relate to the feelings that the girls were going through. Viewers can tell that a lot of thought, hard work and love has been put into this feature. Sofia Coppola directs with an easy hand and an interesting style. Her use of split screen and dream sequences is quite unique and works very well. She truly cares about every one of her characters and it shows. The characters are all very well played. Particularly worth mention are James Woods as the father, Kathleen Turner as the mother, Kirsten Dunst as teasing Lisbon daughter Lux and of course, Josh Hartnett as the only boy who ever got close to a Lisbon girl. The film itself is a memory, recalled by four neighborhood boys who were once (and still may be) obsessed with the five blond beauties that were the Lisbon sisters. Mysterious and seductive, nobody knew much of anything about them, much less why the youngest Cecilia killed herself. As the film moves on, viewers get a closer look at life in the Lisbon household, particularly when a smooth boy named Trip Fontaine becomes obsessed with Lux. He ends up convincing the mother and father to let him take Lux to a homecoming dance, providing dates for the other four girls (p.s. - Hayden Christensen fans - see him pre-Star Wars fame as one of the boys who take the girls out). Things get out of hand to say the least and the girls are put under house arrest by their unstable mother. All meet the same end, as evidenced by the title. While other reviewers have given the film flack about not developing the characters, since the film is from the perspective of people who didn't really know the Lisbon girls, that's the way it's meant to be. The audience is meant to take what they see in their own way. I, personally, liked this about the film. The film seems to have people a little divided in some areas. I say, see it for yourself and decide.

524783,A2RN2AO4BE6F4K,B00003CXH0,"Scott Bright ""scottypotty""","[11, 14]","Movie Summary:  The five Lisbon sisters live and go to high school in a Michigan suburb in the 1970s. They are beautiful, intelligent and witty. They are strictly watched over by their repressive parents and  adored almost to the point of worship by the neighborhood boys. To the outside world they seem like happy girls but one by one their happiness crumbles. The extreme action they take ends up scarring forever the four neighborhood boys who loved them.My Opinion:  The story is beautiful and sad, wonderful and tragic. The plot is well put together and played out. The direction would be top notch for any director not to mention a first time one. The acting is excellent as well and the characters very well cast. With all that out of the way, let me expand upon the story. As we know from the title, the sisters end their lives. Why did they do it? If the boys who knew them best and loved them could never figure it out, is there any hope for us? Maybe not, but there are clues and lessons for us. Before the youngest sister kills herself, she is at her party witnessing the boys having fun with the retarded boy Joe. This cruelty goes right to her sensitive heart and we end up losing her. The remaining four sisters try to keep on without her. They start to live and even find some joy in life. But this is cut short when they are witnesses to a little more of the coldness of the outside world and the extremeness of their own demented mother. We are shown very little more of the Lisbon sisters lives than the neighborhood boys who struggle all their lives but are never able to understand the motives behind the tragic deaths. Thus the viewer becomes one of the boys trying to solve the mystery with far too little to go on. This I feel is a major point of the movie. We can never know the feelings and motives of another person unless we work hard to get into their world. The boys tried in vain to befriend them and help them, but how much can a teenage boy do when we as adults fail as well? So maybe the question shouldn't be &quot;Why did they do it?&quot; but instead  &quot;How could we have saved them?&quot;DVD Quality: Video: Widescreen Anamorphic 1.85:1 Decent video quality.  Sound: DD5.1 with some really good music.  Extras are sparse and include the trailer, music video, making documentary, and a photo album.What You Should Do:  See this movie if you can handle the darkness of the deaths. It is a very deep and though provoking film. It will help you appreciate how fragile and precious life really is. It is not an upbeat film on the surface so it does not make a good Saturday night popcorn movie. But if you can skip the popcorn and look a little deeper, you will be rewarded for your efforts.Related Movies To Check Out: Stand By Me, Outside Providence, High Fidelity, Say Anything, Girl Interrupted",4,Tomorrow Midnight Wait For Our Signal,1002067200,"10 3, 2001",2001,2835,"['Movie', 'Summary', 'five', 'Lisbon', 'sisters', 'live', 'go', 'high', 'school', 'Michigan', 'suburb', '1970s', 'are', 'beautiful', 'intelligent', 'witty', 'are', 'strictly', 'watched', 'repressive', 'parents', 'adored', 'almost', 'point', 'worship', 'neighborhood', 'boys', 'outside', 'world', 'seem', 'happy', 'girls', 'one', 'one', 'happiness', 'crumbles', 'extreme', 'action', 'take', 'up', 'scarring', 'forever', 'four', 'neighborhood', 'boys', 'who', 'loved', 'them.My', 'Opinion', 'story', 'beautiful', 'sad', 'wonderful', 'tragic', 'plot', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'played', 'out', 'direction', 'would', 'be', 'top', 'notch', 'director', 'not', 'mention', 'first', 'time', 'one', 'acting', 'excellent', 'as', 'well', 'characters', 'very', 'well', 'cast', 'way', 'let', 'expand', 'story', 'know', 'title', 'sisters', 'end', 'lives', 'Why', 'did', 'do', 'boys', 'who', 'knew', 'best', 'loved', 'could', 'never', 'figure', 'out', 'there', 'hope', 'Maybe', 'not', 'are', 'clues', 'lessons', 'youngest', 'sister', 'kills', 'party', 'witnessing', 'boys', 'having', 'fun', 'retarded', 'boy', 'Joe', 'cruelty', 'right', 'sensitive', 'heart', 'end', 'up', 'losing', 'remaining', 'four', 'sisters', 'try', 'keep', 'start', 'live', 'even', 'find', 'joy', 'life', 'cut', 'short', 'when', 'are', 'witnesses', 'little', 'more', 'coldness', 'outside', 'world', 'extremeness', 'own', 'demented', 'mother', 'are', 'shown', 'very', 'little', 'more', 'Lisbon', 'sisters', 'neighborhood', 'boys', 'who', 'struggle', 'lives', 'are', 'never', 'able', 'understand', 'motives', 'tragic', 'deaths', 'Thus', 'viewer', 'one', 'boys', 'trying', 'solve', 'mystery', 'far', 'too', 'little', 'go', 'feel', 'major', 'point', 'movie', 'can', 'never', 'know', 'feelings', 'motives', 'person', 'work', 'hard', 'get', 'world', 'boys', 'tried', 'vain', 'befriend', 'help', 'how', 'much', 'can', 'teenage', 'boy', 'do', 'when', 'adults', 'fail', 'as', 'well', 'So', 'maybe', 'question', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'quot', 'Why', 'did', 'do', 'quot', 'instead', 'quot', 'How', 'could', 'have', 'saved', 'quot', 'DVD', 'Quality', 'Video', 'Widescreen', 'Anamorphic', '1.85:1', 'Decent', 'video', 'quality', 'Sound', 'DD5.1', 'really', 'good', 'music', 'Extras', 'are', 'sparse', 'include', 'trailer', 'music', 'video', 'making', 'documentary', 'photo', 'Should', 'Do', 'See', 'movie', 'can', 'handle', 'darkness', 'deaths', 'very', 'deep', 'provoking', 'film', 'will', 'help', 'appreciate', 'how', 'fragile', 'precious', 'life', 'really', 'not', 'upbeat', 'film', 'surface', 'not', 'make', 'good', 'Saturday', 'night', 'popcorn', 'movie', 'can', 'skip', 'popcorn', 'look', 'little', 'deeper', 'will', 'be', 'rewarded', 'efforts.Related', 'Movies', 'Check', 'Stand', 'Me', 'Outside', 'Providence', 'High', 'Fidelity', 'Say', 'Anything', 'Girl', 'Interrupted']",N/A

When I found out it was based on a book, I got the book. I read it in two days, and decided it was my favorite novel (until a few years later when I read Requiem for a Dream). The book was so amazingly original. When I finally saw the film, I wanted sooooo bad to like it. I even convinced myself for a while that I did. The cinematography really was beautiful, but the actual script only had minor things I liked (little added touches with the parents that the book lacked). But when I watched the film again a few years later, I was mad. It was not nearly as clear as the book was (I think the first time I saw it I kind of filled myself in with my knowledge of the book). And honestly, it wasn't even half as interesting or intriguing as the book. When I saw it again, I was shocked at the great reviews.I really didn't like Kirsten Dunst in this. Not bad acting, just a bad script. In the book, the character seemed more real to me, less dumb. I feel like the script just played up on a ""hot"" actress instead of focusing on real character development. Besides the cinematography, the film didn't add enough to the book to actually buy. I would rent it if you loved the book (just to see someone's take on it), but if you haven't, I can't imagine why you would be interested.",1,"Screw the Movie, Read the Book!",1236643200,"03 10, 2009",2009,1409,"['As', 'soon', 'heard', 'title', 'was', 'pining', 'see', 'movie', 'Alas', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'see', 'So', 'researched', 'When', 'found', 'was', 'based', 'book', 'got', 'book', 'read', 'two', 'days', 'decided', 'was', 'favorite', 'novel', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'when', 'read', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'book', 'was', 'so', 'amazingly', 'original', 'When', 'finally', 'saw', 'film', 'wanted', 'sooooo', 'bad', 'even', 'convinced', 'while', 'did', 'cinematography', 'really', 'was', 'beautiful', 'actual', 'script', 'only', 'had', 'minor', 'things', 'liked', 'little', 'added', 'touches', 'parents', 'book', 'lacked', 'when', 'watched', 'film', 'again', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'was', 'mad', 'was', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'clear', 'book', 'was', 'think', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'kind', 'filled', 'knowledge', 'book', 'honestly', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'half', 'interesting', 'intriguing', 'book', 'When', 'saw', 'again', 'was', 'shocked', 'great', 'reviews.I', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Not', 'bad', 'acting', 'just', 'bad', 'script', 'book', 'character', 'seemed', 'more', 'real', 'less', 'dumb', 'feel', 'script', 'just', 'played', 'up', 'hot', 'actress', 'instead', 'focusing', 'real', 'character', 'development', 'cinematography', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'add', 'enough', 'book', 'actually', 'buy', 'would', 'rent', 'loved', 'book', 'just', 'see', 'someone', 'take', 'have', ""n't"", 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'why', 'would', 'be', 'interested']",N/A

I guess that's the point since the whole film is a hazy flashback of events surrounding girls who have long been idealized and deified, but it still doesn't make for a great story.  I mean, Kirsten Dunst is a hottie and all but I still don't see why the hubbub 25 years later.  But what makes the film work is the dead-on depiction of the type of sexual confusion all teenagers go through.  It's a cruel trick by Mother Nature to put us through puberty before we even have an inkling of what it all means (if we ever truly know what it all means).  I also loved the comparisons between the blossoming Lisbon sisters and the diseased elm trees, and the corresponding controls to prevent the further spread of flowering (or contagion) as enacted by the Lisbon parents and the tree cutters, respectively.  Leave it up to humans and their hubris to decide what is best for nature.  The film is also helped immensely by Coppola's use of music.  Not only did Air's film score provide the perfect tone, but the 70's songs chosen also fit each scene perfectly.  And the film should be further commended for showing in a number of scenes just how important pop music is in the life of a teenager, especially as a form of self-expression and a tool for communicating with others.",3,What's the hubbub with them Lisbon girls?,1002153600,"10 4, 2001",2001,1385,"['great', 'stuff', 'film', 'found', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'anything', 'concrete', 'latch', 'hooks', 'guess', 'point', 'whole', 'film', 'hazy', 'flashback', 'events', 'surrounding', 'girls', 'who', 'have', 'long', 'been', 'idealized', 'deified', 'still', ""n't"", 'make', 'great', 'story', 'mean', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'hottie', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'hubbub', '25', 'years', 'later', 'what', 'film', 'work', 'dead-on', 'depiction', 'type', 'sexual', 'confusion', 'teenagers', 'go', 'cruel', 'trick', 'Mother', 'Nature', 'put', 'puberty', 'even', 'have', 'inkling', 'what', 'ever', 'truly', 'know', 'what', 'also', 'loved', 'comparisons', 'blossoming', 'Lisbon', 'sisters', 'diseased', 'elm', 'trees', 'corresponding', 'prevent', 'further', 'spread', 'flowering', 'contagion', 'enacted', 'Lisbon', 'parents', 'tree', 'cutters', 'respectively', 'Leave', 'up', 'humans', 'hubris', 'decide', 'what', 'best', 'nature', 'film', 'also', 'helped', 'immensely', 'Coppola', 'use', 'music', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'Air', 'film', 'score', 'provide', 'perfect', 'tone', '70', 'songs', 'chosen', 'also', 'fit', 'scene', 'perfectly', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'further', 'commended', 'showing', 'number', 'scenes', 'just', 'how', 'important', 'pop', 'music', 'life', 'teenager', 'especially', 'form', 'self-expression', 'tool', 'communicating', 'others']",N/A

There were times that the last times - &quot;In the end it didn't matter that they died, or that they were girls, but only that we loved them&quot; would surface and I'll try to place them, but when I heard about the film coming out I had to see it. I read the novel again afterwards, and have to say that the film is well adapted.The Virgin Suicides tells the tale of five sisters, daughters of a bookish teacher and a forceful, religious and oppresive mother. The youngest of the daughters attempts to kill herself because of her sadness with the world... the sadness only a 13-year old girl could possibly feel. She survives, and for a while it seems that her mother might relent enough to let her and her sisters live. But it isn't to be. Through various developments, she successfully kills herself and it is that shadow that propels the other daughters to eventually do the same. But it isn't their deaths that is important. The Virgin Suicides is a tale of young love, idealogical and distant love and the perceptions of youth. It is inherently melodramatic, and possibly even pretentious. But it's still beautiful, haunting and very well directed.If you feel that the characters (the daughters) are not developed, you must understand the perspective of the story: the five sisters do not represent real human beings. They are shadows of the boys' perceptions of them, even Lux and her sexuality. They are 'visions of womanhood that no wife could match', shadows of sadness and dramatics that have great impact on the boys who admire them from afar, but very rarely treat them as humans. We do not learn who the sisters really are because the boys are not capable of knowing who the sisters really are. The tale is told in the half-mythic vein of memory, with the shadows of the girls' suicides hanging long on the collective makeup of the men who were the boys.",4,A brilliant directorial debut of a strong novel,978393600,"01 2, 2001",2001,1992,"['novel', 'Virgin', 'Suicides', 'haunted', 'when', 'first', 'read', 'years', 'then', 'have', ""n't"", 'thought', 'much', 'were', 'times', 'last', 'times', 'quot', 'end', 'did', ""n't"", 'matter', 'died', 'were', 'girls', 'only', 'loved', 'quot', 'would', 'surface', ""'ll"", 'try', 'place', 'when', 'heard', 'film', 'coming', 'out', 'had', 'see', 'read', 'novel', 'again', 'afterwards', 'have', 'say', 'film', 'well', 'adapted.The', 'Virgin', 'Suicides', 'tale', 'five', 'sisters', 'daughters', 'bookish', 'teacher', 'forceful', 'religious', 'oppresive', 'mother', 'youngest', 'daughters', 'attempts', 'kill', 'sadness', 'world', 'sadness', 'only', '13-year', 'old', 'girl', 'could', 'possibly', 'feel', 'while', 'mother', 'might', 'relent', 'enough', 'let', 'sisters', 'live', ""n't"", 'be', 'various', 'developments', 'successfully', 'shadow', 'other', 'daughters', 'eventually', 'do', 'same', ""n't"", 'deaths', 'important', 'Virgin', 'Suicides', 'tale', 'young', 'love', 'idealogical', 'distant', 'love', 'perceptions', 'youth', 'inherently', 'melodramatic', 'possibly', 'even', 'pretentious', 'still', 'beautiful', 'haunting', 'very', 'well', 'directed.If', 'feel', 'characters', 'daughters', 'are', 'not', 'developed', 'must', 'understand', 'perspective', 'story', 'five', 'sisters', 'do', 'not', 'represent', 'real', 'human', 'beings', 'are', 'shadows', 'boys', 'perceptions', 'even', 'Lux', 'sexuality', 'are', ""'visions"", 'womanhood', 'wife', 'could', 'match', 'shadows', 'sadness', 'dramatics', 'have', 'great', 'impact', 'boys', 'who', 'admire', 'afar', 'very', 'rarely', 'treat', 'humans', 'do', 'not', 'learn', 'who', 'sisters', 'really', 'are', 'boys', 'are', 'not', 'capable', 'knowing', 'who', 'sisters', 'really', 'are', 'tale', 'told', 'half-mythic', 'vein', 'memory', 'shadows', 'girls', 'suicides', 'hanging', 'long', 'collective', 'makeup', 'men', 'who', 'were', 'boys']",N/A

524795,AEKVNXC6R8O9G,B00003CXH0,The philosopher,"[7, 10]","The fascination of the closeness of vivacious and attractive sisters is partly what draws people to Little Women and is at the center of The Virgin Suicides.  Unfortunately, The Virgin Suicides does not have the sparks of Little Women.  The narrator (Giovanni Risbisi) of the Virgin Suicides talks in a monotone and sounds bored, the boys in the film look bored and robotic (especially in their first and last scenes in front of the Lisbon household), and half the time the Lisbon sisters look bored.  Is it any wonder that I was bored too?The Lisbon sisters are the heart of the film, and it is crucial that there be something mysterious, seductive, and magical about them to explain why the neighborhood boys are infatuated with them and why we should find them interesting too.  The problem that this movie cannot overcome is that rather than seeing the girls through the eyes of the boys (as could be done in a novel), where the Lisbon sisters would be the summit of existence, we instead see them through our own eyes.  Looked at that way, they're just girls.  We cannot identify with the boys and their obsession.  The whole thing just seems childish.  Neither the girls nor the boys are given much characterization, so the story does not draw us in and elicits no emotion despite dealing with what should be a shocking and poignant subject, teenage suicide.  (Even the author of The Virgin Suicides admits in the DVD behind-the-scenes-documentary that the novel is weak on characterization.)Although James Woods and Kathleen Turner do the best they can do with what they are given, they are playing stock characters: the nerdy mathematics teacher (James Woods) and the repressed, steely mother (Kathleen Turner).  In fact, all of the adults come across as dolts, including Danny DeVito in a cameo as a psychiatrist.  Josh Hartnett is surprisingly good as the studly, self-centered high school jock.  His insertion into the movie midway through helps to light some sparks, but his character is dispatched as abruptly as it was introduced.Sofia Coppola does a fine job creating a dreamy mood and adds some stylish visual touches to the film, but that cannot compensate for an uninteresting screenplay, which she wrote.In the end, the &quot;mystery&quot; of why these girls killed themselves proves to be of little interest, and the boys' infatuation with the girls 25 years after they committed suicide -- the men talk about the girls even to this day and try to make sense of it all! -- comes across as cases of arrested development.

As I write this, more than 200 people have given plot summaries so I won't add one more.I think the move is quite awful. If the movie was supposed to be about the feelings of the narrator then I might consider giving the movie an extra ""star."" Or if the movie was supposed to remind us that ""normal"" teens commit suicide, that might give it two stars, also.But a movie should, in my opinion, be more than, say, a newspaper story that tell of a suicide of a teen with the always-asked question: WHY? A movie can get into the thoughts and feelings of the people, give insight into their anger or despair, and still show how parents or friends can be both clueless and a contributor to their problem.But, except for the pitifully lame statement, ""You don't know what it is like to be a 13-year-old girl,"" this movie does none of that.Other movies, ""Dead Poet's Society"" and ""Ordinary People"", and probably others, have done a credible job with this topic.

I wanted to see it when it was playing at the movies, but I guess it didn't play in my area.  Anyway, this is a pretty good movie.  It's nice, bittersweet, and sad at the same time.  It shows the danger that can come from overprotecting kids the way the parents do to their five daughters in this movie.  The way the parents overprotect the five Lisbon daughters is definitely not good for them.  It hinders their emotional, social, and intellectual growth. Because of their parents' overprotection, the girls kill themselves.  Now, I know that suicide is not the answer to any problem, but I can understand why.  They feel trapped, isolated from the outside world in which they can develop into their own people.  This movie also shows the bittersweet romance that develops between Lux Lisbon and Trip Fontaine, the school hunk.  I thought it was really beautiful.  You can also see the sadness in the girls during the scenes in which some neighborhood boys (who are fascinated by them) play them songs from records over the phone.

It takes a while to sink in, but is actually a beautiful piece of film-making.  Sophie Coppola's debut as a director is simply brilliant.Virgin Suicides focusses on an American family with five daughters in 1976.  Tragedy occurs in the first twenty minutes of the film when the youngest daughter commits suicides for the second time and succeeds. What a brave film to tackle such a taboo subject ie. teenage suicide.  And I'm glad they have, because too many films pussy-foot around this sensitive subject, but let's face it, suicide happens every day of the week.  Sweeping it under the carpet does not help society understand it, or deal with it.  This film explores the impact of suicide on the remaining family members but also the neighbourhood.Nothing can quite prepare you for the ending of this film.  Overall, a very tragic film, and reasonably depressing to watch.  However, on the other hand it is a beautiful film  because it makes the viewer evaluate life and consider issues which are often not discussed.A film which has been overlooked by so many (probably because of the sensitive theme), yet deserves to be watched by all.
