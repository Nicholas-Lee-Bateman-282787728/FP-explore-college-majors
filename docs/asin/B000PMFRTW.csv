This graphic, archaic relic of a film should only now stand as a historical document on how our attitudes towards whales and sea life used to be. The people involved in this film were more interested in being considered &#34;adventurers&#34; and being &#34;the first&#34; at something than in the great white shark they were trying to capture on film. Watching their elation at whales being harpooned so sharks would be attracted to the carnage so they could get their footage is truly sickening. They chose to manufacture a feeding frenzy from harpooned and bleeding whales, then put themselves in danger by swimming outside their shark cages to get closer footage of oceanic white tip sharks, and then killed them if the sharks got too close. Talk about raping the seas - these idiots should be ashamed and embarrassed at this film instead of claiming that they brought any kind of positive public awareness to whales, sharks, or any other type of sea life. Even in the DVD commentary they really don't show any true remorse for the whales or sharks they killed for the sake of their movie.",1,"Blue Bloods, White Arrogance",1404518400,"07 5, 2014",2014,1176,"['Never', 'before', 'such', 'arrogance', 'disregard', 'towards', 'nature', 'been', 'captured', 'film', 'graphic', 'archaic', 'relic', 'film', 'should', 'only', 'now', 'stand', 'historical', 'document', 'how', 'attitudes', 'whales', 'sea', 'life', 'used', 'be', 'people', 'involved', 'film', 'were', 'more', 'interested', 'being', 'considered', '34', 'adventurers', '34', 'being', '34', 'first', '34', 'something', 'great', 'white', 'shark', 'were', 'trying', 'capture', 'film', 'Watching', 'elation', 'whales', 'being', 'harpooned', 'so', 'sharks', 'would', 'be', 'attracted', 'carnage', 'could', 'get', 'footage', 'truly', 'sickening', 'chose', 'manufacture', 'feeding', 'frenzy', 'harpooned', 'bleeding', 'whales', 'then', 'put', 'danger', 'swimming', 'outside', 'shark', 'cages', 'get', 'closer', 'footage', 'oceanic', 'white', 'tip', 'sharks', 'then', 'killed', 'sharks', 'got', 'too', 'close', 'Talk', 'raping', 'seas', 'idiots', 'should', 'be', 'ashamed', 'embarrassed', 'film', 'instead', 'claiming', 'brought', 'kind', 'positive', 'public', 'awareness', 'whales', 'sharks', 'other', 'type', 'sea', 'life', 'Even', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'show', 'true', 'remorse', 'whales', 'sharks', 'killed', 'sake', 'movie']","Blue Water, White Death"

1072207,A3X3V1QTS464Y,B000PMFRTW,Collector 4 Life,"[1, 1]","Having grown up in the 60's and 70's I can certainly speak to the intensity in which this film was received. Back in those days so little was known about the Great White and no documentary illustrates that better. Here we have arguably the top researchers and explorers in the hunt, aimlessly searching without the slightest notion what to do to attract this creature. Science has certainly come a long way since those days and the viewer should certainly take that into account when watching this. But what the makers of this film (and Valerie Harper in particular) don't want you to see was the hype THEY MANUFACTURED while making and showing this documentary. Before setting sail in South Africa, a public announcement is made stating they are in search of the ""most dangerous predator still alive in the world today"". Describes them as ""attacking"" the remains of whales afloat off the coast and basically paints the picture (mainly born from ignorance) that these creatures are to be feared. And then of course you have all of these classic posters and even now the DVD cover that invoke their own sensationalism.But today we have a very coy Valerie Harper playing dumb to this message they themselves concocted and plays the innocent lamb that can't 'understand' why Jaws carried the impact it did. So if you ever wonder what started this sensationalism over the Great White, well... your watching it right here. And a great deal of it specifically came from Ron and Valerie Taylor. And while they have spent the remainder of their lives trying to perform revisionist history for themselves, the truth is these two people were traveling America in the early 70's, going from town to town, scaring people with this film. Jaws was simply the cherry placed on top. All of these statements about protecting the Great White in the past 30 years have been said strictly to pacify their liberal, scientific peers who essentially are cleaning up the mess they made. So watch this film with that thought well in place. The documentary itself is fascinating to watch because of the collection of iconic faces from the scientific world. A real gem for most of the right reasons, but also a product that carries the dark legacy of starting the sensationalism that has lasted more than 40 years about this creature.",4,"Blue Water, green explorers",1389398400,"01 11, 2014",2014,2307,"['Having', 'grown', 'up', '60', '70', 'can', 'certainly', 'speak', 'intensity', 'film', 'was', 'received', 'Back', 'days', 'so', 'little', 'was', 'known', 'Great', 'White', 'documentary', 'better', 'Here', 'have', 'arguably', 'top', 'researchers', 'explorers', 'hunt', 'aimlessly', 'searching', 'slightest', 'notion', 'what', 'do', 'attract', 'creature', 'Science', 'certainly', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'days', 'viewer', 'should', 'certainly', 'take', 'account', 'when', 'watching', 'what', 'makers', 'film', 'Valerie', 'Harper', 'particular', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'was', 'hype', 'THEY', 'MANUFACTURED', 'making', 'showing', 'documentary', 'setting', 'sail', 'South', 'Africa', 'public', 'announcement', 'made', 'stating', 'are', 'search', 'most', 'dangerous', 'predator', 'still', 'alive', 'world', 'today', 'Describes', 'attacking', 'remains', 'whales', 'afloat', 'coast', 'basically', 'picture', 'mainly', 'born', 'ignorance', 'creatures', 'are', 'be', 'feared', 'then', 'course', 'have', 'classic', 'posters', 'even', 'now', 'DVD', 'cover', 'invoke', 'own', 'sensationalism.But', 'today', 'have', 'very', 'coy', 'Valerie', 'Harper', 'playing', 'dumb', 'message', 'concocted', 'innocent', 'lamb', 'ca', ""n't"", ""'understand"", 'why', 'Jaws', 'carried', 'impact', 'did', 'So', 'ever', 'wonder', 'what', 'started', 'sensationalism', 'Great', 'White', 'well', 'watching', 'right', 'here', 'great', 'deal', 'specifically', 'came', 'Ron', 'Valerie', 'Taylor', 'have', 'spent', 'remainder', 'lives', 'trying', 'perform', 'revisionist', 'history', 'truth', 'two', 'people', 'were', 'traveling', 'America', 'early', '70', 'going', 'town', 'town', 'scaring', 'people', 'film', 'Jaws', 'was', 'simply', 'cherry', 'placed', 'top', 'statements', 'protecting', 'Great', 'White', 'past', '30', 'years', 'have', 'been', 'said', 'strictly', 'pacify', 'liberal', 'scientific', 'peers', 'who', 'essentially', 'are', 'cleaning', 'up', 'mess', 'made', 'So', 'watch', 'film', 'thought', 'well', 'place', 'documentary', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'collection', 'iconic', 'scientific', 'world', 'real', 'gem', 'most', 'right', 'reasons', 'also', 'product', 'dark', 'legacy', 'starting', 'sensationalism', 'lasted', 'more', '40', 'years', 'creature']","Blue Water, White Death"

Long before Shark Week and not too much before Jaws came Blue Water, White Death, which I was lucky to have taped off a TV channel so I could watch it over and over. From the start of the expedition and the launching of the Terrier to the moment all viewers waited for off Dangerous Reef was non-stop excitement, letdowns, concerns for Peter Gimbel when he got the bends, and finally success in Australia on the suggeston of Rodney Fox to head there if they wanted to find  and film great whites. There was such camaraderie (I checked for the spelling in my dictionary but it isn't there) among the crew members. On board was brother to late Harry Chapin, Tom Chapin, who began the movie with the wonderful South Winds song, as well as the funny if inaccurate The Most Chivalrous Shark of the Ocean (who really does not eat just men). From one place to another the scientists and photographers hunted for the great white, but the viewers were not disappointed when they failed because there were plenty of other sharks to keep them satisfied. The action they found when they succeeded more than made up for their earlier failures. I am so pleased this movie was released on a DVD and hope some who haven't seen it will buy it for the unmatched excellence of this expedition knowing everything they see is real. No computer graphics back in those days, anyway. I have read Blue Meridian so many years ago I had forgotten about it until one of these reviewers mentioned it and would be worth purchasing along with the movie to get a more in-depth accounting of all that took place.

Hansen,"[5, 5]","I just watched this movie for the first time and I must say i was amazed!This documentary by Peter Gimbel follows his crew to exotic locations including South Africa, Madagascar, Ceylon and Australia looking to be the first to film the Great White shark in its own world. The footage is fantastic with some of the most harrowing moments ever shot on film. Truly the moment where one by one the divers exit the safety of their cages to film dozens of feeding oceanic whitetips is unprecedented and unlikely to be repeated again. I couldn't believe my eyes as the Taylors(Ron & Valerie) and Peter Gimbel continuously prodded away the inquisitive sharks while Stan Waterman filmed the breathless action. When the crew travels to Dangerous Reef,Australia and meets the Great White, the results are spectacular. Never before had a Great White been filmed in its own environment and the pulse-pounding work of these underwater pioneers is priceless.
