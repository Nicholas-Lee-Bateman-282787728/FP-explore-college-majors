1108799,A32RF0KJA4ZE6E,B000WDTO1Q,Alanna Evans,"[16, 17]","This is a very fun series made available once again by ADV Films.  This is the (fourth?) release of this series and probably the best - all DVDs are collected in slimpacks housed within a nice casing. It looks great on your shelf and takes up minimal space.But is it any good?  For a mid 90s OVA, yes it is.  If you have watched and enjoyed the likes of Slayers, Dragon Half or Rune Soldier, Sorcerer Hunters will be right up your alley.  There is a nice balance between comedy and serious plotlines.  Most episodes are fairly standalone until the end, where there is an overarching story plot.  Its light fare, and definitely entertaining.  Animation-wise it is alright, with some animated (transformation) sequences repeated, but that's a minor gripe.A good price for a classic show you might have missed out on the first time around!! Check it out!",4,For Fans of Fantasy Comedy...,1207785600,"04 10, 2008",2008,851,"['very', 'fun', 'series', 'made', 'available', 'once', 'again', 'ADV', 'Films', 'fourth', 'release', 'series', 'probably', 'best', 'DVDs', 'are', 'collected', 'slimpacks', 'housed', 'nice', 'casing', 'great', 'shelf', 'up', 'minimal', 'space.But', 'good', 'mid', '90s', 'OVA', 'yes', 'have', 'watched', 'enjoyed', 'likes', 'Slayers', 'Dragon', 'Half', 'Rune', 'Soldier', 'Sorcerer', 'Hunters', 'will', 'be', 'right', 'alley', 'nice', 'balance', 'comedy', 'serious', 'plotlines', 'Most', 'episodes', 'are', 'fairly', 'standalone', 'end', 'where', 'overarching', 'story', 'plot', 'light', 'fare', 'definitely', 'entertaining', 'Animation-wise', 'alright', 'animated', 'transformation', 'sequences', 'repeated', 'minor', 'gripe.A', 'good', 'price', 'classic', 'show', 'might', 'have', 'missed', 'out', 'first', 'time', 'Check', 'out']",Sorcerer Hunters: Perfect Collection
1108800,A398OOUO8Y7OYB,B000WDTO1Q,"Bruce Grubb ""Bruce Grubb""","[1, 1]","This series is like somebody took the basic monster of the week theme of Sailor Moon, thrown in an idea from Urusei Yatsura, and then topped the whole thing off with Slayers as a seeming afterthought.The basic plot for the first episodes is that our group is sent in to take out an evil sorcerer with Carrot (who changes into an rampaging monster every time he gets hit with a spell), Gateau (swordsman), Carrot's brother Marron, and the women Chocolate and Tira who when they are not turning into scantly clad dominatrixes to beat monster Carrot back under control are beating him up in normal form for coming on to nearly every female that crosses his path.The main problem is in addition to these five characters you have their boss Big Mamma and the fairy like girl Dotta (Daughter) that serves as her messenger and few of the characters really get developed.  In fact, the first 12 or so episodes could be summed as: our group is sent in, Carrot gets hit by spell, turns into monster, tears sorcerer apart, Chocolate and Tira then transform and beat crap out of Monster Carrot, rinse and repeat.  There are hints that Big Mama has some dark secret and that Carrot has something inside him that if awakened will force Big Mama to kill him but it is IMHO not enough to keep most viewers to keep going.Then there is the problem that with so many characters to deal with plot points are brought up and then left dangling.  For instance, in ""In Between Dreams and Reality"" the group goes searching for a magical book that can make your dreams come true.  For reasons not immediately clear Dotta looses her wings and after talking to Carrot disappears for the rest of the episode.  Then you get to the ending of this episode and you have no idea what has just happened--did they defeat the book? are they still in the book?Past this point the series decides to get its act together and the dark secret becomes clearer but by that time I doubt most viewers will care.  There is not the one big bad boss is behind all this you had in Sailor Moon or even exploration and meeting new character you have in Slayers to get you this far into the series and by the time we finally meet the big bad I found I simply didn't care enough to continue.",2,Interesting but uneven series,1279152000,"07 15, 2010",2010,2237,"['series', 'somebody', 'took', 'basic', 'monster', 'week', 'theme', 'Sailor', 'Moon', 'thrown', 'idea', 'Urusei', 'Yatsura', 'then', 'topped', 'whole', 'thing', 'off', 'Slayers', 'seeming', 'afterthought.The', 'basic', 'plot', 'first', 'episodes', 'group', 'sent', 'take', 'out', 'evil', 'sorcerer', 'Carrot', 'who', 'rampaging', 'monster', 'time', 'hit', 'spell', 'Gateau', 'swordsman', 'Carrot', 'brother', 'Marron', 'women', 'Chocolate', 'Tira', 'who', 'when', 'are', 'not', 'turning', 'scantly', 'clad', 'dominatrixes', 'beat', 'monster', 'Carrot', 'back', 'control', 'are', 'beating', 'up', 'normal', 'form', 'coming', 'nearly', 'female', 'path.The', 'main', 'problem', 'addition', 'five', 'characters', 'have', 'boss', 'Big', 'Mamma', 'fairy', 'girl', 'Dotta', 'Daughter', 'messenger', 'few', 'characters', 'really', 'get', 'developed', 'fact', 'first', '12', 'so', 'episodes', 'could', 'be', 'summed', 'group', 'sent', 'Carrot', 'hit', 'spell', 'monster', 'tears', 'sorcerer', 'apart', 'Chocolate', 'Tira', 'then', 'transform', 'beat', 'crap', 'Monster', 'Carrot', 'rinse', 'repeat', 'are', 'hints', 'Big', 'Mama', 'dark', 'secret', 'Carrot', 'something', 'inside', 'awakened', 'will', 'force', 'Big', 'Mama', 'kill', 'IMHO', 'not', 'enough', 'keep', 'most', 'viewers', 'keep', 'going.Then', 'problem', 'so', 'many', 'characters', 'deal', 'plot', 'points', 'are', 'brought', 'up', 'then', 'left', 'dangling', 'instance', 'Between', 'Dreams', 'Reality', 'group', 'searching', 'magical', 'book', 'can', 'make', 'dreams', 'come', 'true', 'reasons', 'not', 'immediately', 'clear', 'Dotta', 'wings', 'talking', 'Carrot', 'disappears', 'rest', 'episode', 'Then', 'get', 'ending', 'episode', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'just', 'happened', 'did', 'defeat', 'book', 'are', 'still', 'book', 'point', 'series', 'get', 'act', 'together', 'dark', 'secret', 'clearer', 'time', 'doubt', 'most', 'viewers', 'will', 'care', 'not', 'one', 'big', 'bad', 'boss', 'had', 'Sailor', 'Moon', 'even', 'exploration', 'meeting', 'new', 'character', 'have', 'Slayers', 'get', 'far', 'series', 'time', 'finally', 'meet', 'big', 'bad', 'found', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'enough', 'continue']",Sorcerer Hunters: Perfect Collection
1108801,A3QO324Z4CUNNO,B000WDTO1Q,"Charles Stuckey ""stuck-fla""","[0, 0]","While not very old, the style is more along the lines of the older ""Slayers"", which is what it seems to be trying to copy. It is watchable, but parents should be aware that unlike slayers there are adult situations and some fan service. While not really bloody, there is a fair bit of violence.The story is about a team of sorcerer hunters working for a supernatural entity called ""Big Mama"". It has some good points and develops a story line, including some character development, but not as much as it could. Some of the characters are developed more while others get less attention. If you're in the mood for something with serious moments in the middle of a comedy, and aren't looking to think too much, this is a good series.Overall I liked it, but unlike most I've recently picked up, I haven't bothered to go back and watch it again. (I usually at least watch each once dubbed and once subbed).Not really disappointing, but not outstanding either.",3,"Good, but not real original.",1278374400,"07 6, 2010",2010,954,"['not', 'very', 'old', 'style', 'more', 'lines', 'older', 'Slayers', 'what', 'be', 'trying', 'copy', 'watchable', 'parents', 'should', 'be', 'aware', 'slayers', 'are', 'adult', 'situations', 'fan', 'service', 'not', 'really', 'bloody', 'fair', 'bit', 'violence.The', 'story', 'team', 'sorcerer', 'hunters', 'working', 'supernatural', 'entity', 'called', 'Big', 'Mama', 'good', 'points', 'story', 'line', 'including', 'character', 'development', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'could', 'characters', 'are', 'developed', 'more', 'others', 'get', 'less', 'attention', ""'re"", 'mood', 'something', 'serious', 'moments', 'middle', 'comedy', 'are', ""n't"", 'looking', 'think', 'too', 'much', 'good', 'series.Overall', 'liked', 'most', ""'ve"", 'recently', 'picked', 'up', 'have', ""n't"", 'bothered', 'go', 'back', 'watch', 'again', 'usually', 'least', 'watch', 'once', 'dubbed', 'once', 'subbed', '.Not', 'really', 'disappointing', 'not', 'outstanding', 'either']",Sorcerer Hunters: Perfect Collection

I had delayed buying it as the price seems a bit high, but it was worth the cost. As these gals continue slaying evil sorcerers, you start to get the feeling that Big Momma has a scret pass and she does. I won't go into that here as it would spoil it for others. The reason for the four stars is that for some reason the series just didn't grab hold of me. I run into this and when that happens, I usually have trouble giving 5 stars. I do suggest buying this one however as it does have an interesting ending.",4,Interesting Anime,1323302400,"12 8, 2011",2011,588,"['Well', 'liked', 'set', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'had', 'delayed', 'buying', 'price', 'bit', 'high', 'was', 'worth', 'cost', 'gals', 'continue', 'slaying', 'evil', 'sorcerers', 'start', 'get', 'feeling', 'Big', 'Momma', 'scret', 'pass', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'here', 'would', 'spoil', 'others', 'reason', 'four', 'stars', 'reason', 'series', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'grab', 'hold', 'run', 'when', 'usually', 'have', 'trouble', 'giving', '5', 'stars', 'do', 'suggest', 'buying', 'one', 'however', 'have', 'interesting', 'ending']",Sorcerer Hunters: Perfect Collection
