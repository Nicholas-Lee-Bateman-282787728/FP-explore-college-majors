1035667,A1A4NH8B337AQG,B000KWZ1PC,Albert G. Smith Jr.,"[7, 10]","I became an instant fan of this series when I accidentally saw it while watching Adult Swim.  When I discovered this show, I had already missed several of the episodes, so I had hoped for a DVD set to have the show presented in a perfect way and in the proper sequence.  In this regard, this DVD set meets those requirements.One of the reasons that I wanted to have the show on DVD was that I was always impressed with the density of things in the frame to view.  I was always freeze-framing my VCR trying to read the small print in the scenes through the noise of the out-dated medium of video tape.  The DVD has a very nice freeze-frame image, allowing you to see the various gags like the products in the sex shop or the accoutrements in Reverend Putty's office (such as a coffee mug that says, ""I hate my boss"").If there is any let down for me, it is that the special features of this set could have been so much more complete.  I was expecting Dino to talk about his experiences with dogma that led him to do this series.  As for the stop-frame animation, I was expecting the same treatment that I saw on the DVD for ""Team America"" about the process of the animation.  The behind the scenes of the making of Moral Orel are pretty sparse.  There are some of the models used and some very superficial talk about the process, but no real insight to what it takes to bring the episode to the screen.  Also if I may, the various special features that have the creative team on-camera makes the impression that they are , uh, er, less than uh, ... well fill in your own word, but alcohol and frat boy antics are only funny for so long.  The special features are less than special, and could have been just so much more.One point about the navigation... I was let down about the lack of commentary during the episodes.  At least that is what I thought.  Only after watching all 15 epidsodes, did I accidentally find the commentary track.  If you hit ""Play All"" on the menu screen, the episodes just play in order.  To get the ability to hear commentary, you have to go to the episode list screen, click on the specific episode, and only then will a prompt appear for the ""commentary off or on"" choice.  I watched all of the episodes that offered it (not all do) with commentary, and amongst the banter picked up some cool tidbits about the process and hassles of the animation.  Often there were just too many (unidentifiable) people talking over each other and cutting up with inside jokes.  Oh well.That said, I have 15 pristine episodes of Moral Orel on DVD now and for that I am happy.",4,"great show, but special features are lacking",1177977600,"05 1, 2007",2007,2587,"['became', 'instant', 'fan', 'series', 'when', 'accidentally', 'saw', 'watching', 'Adult', 'Swim', 'When', 'discovered', 'show', 'had', 'already', 'missed', 'several', 'episodes', 'had', 'hoped', 'DVD', 'set', 'have', 'show', 'presented', 'perfect', 'way', 'proper', 'sequence', 'regard', 'DVD', 'set', 'meets', 'requirements.One', 'reasons', 'wanted', 'have', 'show', 'DVD', 'was', 'was', 'always', 'impressed', 'density', 'things', 'frame', 'view', 'was', 'always', 'freeze-framing', 'VCR', 'trying', 'read', 'small', 'print', 'scenes', 'noise', 'out-dated', 'medium', 'video', 'tape', 'DVD', 'very', 'nice', 'freeze-frame', 'image', 'allowing', 'see', 'various', 'gags', 'products', 'sex', 'shop', 'accoutrements', 'Reverend', 'Putty', 'office', 'such', 'coffee', 'mug', 'hate', 'boss', '.If', 'let', 'down', 'special', 'features', 'set', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'complete', 'was', 'expecting', 'Dino', 'talk', 'experiences', 'dogma', 'led', 'do', 'series', 'stop-frame', 'animation', 'was', 'expecting', 'same', 'treatment', 'saw', 'DVD', 'Team', 'America', 'process', 'animation', 'scenes', 'making', 'Moral', 'Orel', 'are', 'pretty', 'sparse', 'are', 'models', 'used', 'very', 'superficial', 'talk', 'process', 'real', 'insight', 'what', 'bring', 'episode', 'screen', 'Also', 'may', 'various', 'special', 'features', 'have', 'creative', 'team', 'on-camera', 'impression', 'are', 'uh', 'er', 'less', 'uh', 'well', 'fill', 'own', 'word', 'alcohol', 'frat', 'boy', 'antics', 'are', 'only', 'funny', 'so', 'long', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'less', 'special', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'more.One', 'point', 'navigation', 'was', 'let', 'down', 'lack', 'commentary', 'episodes', 'least', 'what', 'thought', 'Only', 'watching', '15', 'epidsodes', 'did', 'accidentally', 'find', 'commentary', 'track', 'hit', 'Play', 'menu', 'screen', 'episodes', 'just', 'play', 'order', 'get', 'ability', 'hear', 'commentary', 'have', 'go', 'episode', 'list', 'screen', 'click', 'specific', 'episode', 'only', 'then', 'will', 'prompt', 'appear', 'commentary', 'off', 'choice', 'watched', 'episodes', 'offered', 'not', 'do', 'commentary', 'banter', 'picked', 'up', 'cool', 'tidbits', 'process', 'hassles', 'animation', 'were', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'unidentifiable', 'people', 'talking', 'other', 'cutting', 'up', 'inside', 'jokes', 'Oh', 'said', 'have', '15', 'pristine', 'episodes', 'Moral', 'Orel', 'DVD', 'now', 'am', 'happy']","Moral Orel, Vol. 1, The Unholy Edition"

It's a dark satirical take on it as well as the twistedness to only expect from [adult swim]. It just lampoons Christianity propaganda in every aspect. It's brilliant and the special features are amazing. A documentry of Moral Orel includes but not limited to Dino treating his Frankenstine model like a baby and probably the greatest behind the scenes moment of Moral Orel history. Dino drunk at Comic Con with commentary included and optional. It's really funny, one of them end up wearing a Moral Orel thong while the Venture Bros and Robot Chicken folk are just completely embarrioused to be there and eventually the Moral Orel team get kicked out of Comic Con for that, Dino drinking a Vokda being slightly drunk and just fighting back any negativity against the show and him. It's really funny, as entertaining as the show. Maybe a little more. lol But seriously if you like satire, and don't mind the nothings sacret religious lampoonery, then I strongly recommend as well as Dino's new show ""Frankenhole"". Garentee to offend any Christian. Trust me, my best friend is Christian, I showed in an episode and had to shut it off within 3 minutes because he looked like he was going to either, scream, cry or rage.

1035677,A3M2AZ0YXQNMKU,B000KWZ1PC,"Tenchi Masaki ""Jurai's Heir""","[30, 37]","Moral Orel is a stop motion animated show on Cartoon Network's ""Adult Swim"" segment, which centers around the life of Orel Puppington, a young boy who consistently fails in his attempts to understand and abide by Protestant Christian values. Orel takes his cues from the authority figures around him--his parents Clay and Bloberta, school coach Stopframe, Rev. Putty, and others. Unfortunately for Orel, he always misunderstands the actions of his mentors, who are mostly shown as bitter, jaded, and merely paying lip service to their religious beliefs. These misunderstandings lead to the comedy in the show, with young Orel believing that he's following the Lord's wishes by smoking crack, reanimating the bodies of dead townsfolk, or practicing euthanasia. At the end of each show, Orel's misbehaviour is discovered and he's taken to his father's study. The lessons his father explains to him aren't what one might expect, however... Moral Orel is at once a parody on classic values-based programming such as the 1960s series ""Davey and Goliath,"" and a commentary on the lip service paid to religion by society at large in a modern world.Season one episodes include:1. The Best Christmas Ever - After Rev. Putty teaches Orel that Jesus will one day return to the earth, he believes that his younger brother, Shapey, is the second coming of Christ. Orel's parents plan for their divorce, and Christmas looks to be an unhappy one.2. The Lord's Greatest Gift - After learning that God's greatest gift is life, Orel recruits his friend Doughy to help protect that gift. A library book, a graveyard full of dead townsfolk, and Orel's convictions spell trouble for the population of Moralton.3. Waste - Orel learns that God doesn't look kindly on the wasteful. After lessons from Coach Stopframe and his father, he sets out with two goals in mind. Orel must stop his own wastefulness, and ensure he doesn't end up the failure his father predicts of him.4. Charity - Orel learns that God is present in everyone and everything. He ends up excusing himself from school, and going on a trip across town believing that he is able to stop people from sinning and heal them.5. Omnipresence - Orel learns that God is present in everyone and everything. He ends up excusing himself from school, and going on a trip across town believing that he is able to stop people from sinning and heal them.6. The Blessed Union - Orel learns that husbands should do everything they can to keep their wives happy. He goes around town and asks women including his mother, what they want.7. God-Fearing - Halloween is boring for Orel when he believes that he doesn't have anything to fear since God is with him at all times. Hoping to get scared, Orel decides to make God angry with him by breaking all 10 Commandments.8. Maturity - After getting shot in the eye with Shapey's BB gun, Orel's father tells him to be more repsonsible and mature. In order to learn more about maturity, Orel goes to the local bar and drinks alcohol which is known to him as ""Maturity Juice"".9. Loyalty -  After running into Orel at church, Coach Stopframe asks if Orel would become Bible Buddies with his nephew Joe, who isn't settled into christianity yet. Despite Joe doing bad things for fun, Orel believes that it he should be a loyal friend and go along with it.10. God's Chef - In order to please himself (if you know what I mean) and still go to heaven, Orel has a scheme that turns Moralton topsy-turvy.",5,"Out Law All The Eggs, That Come From Between The!!....",1169078400,"01 18, 2007",2007,3464,"['Moral', 'Orel', 'stop', 'motion', 'animated', 'show', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'Adult', 'Swim', 'segment', 'life', 'Orel', 'Puppington', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'consistently', 'attempts', 'understand', 'abide', 'Protestant', 'Christian', 'values', 'Orel', 'cues', 'authority', 'figures', 'parents', 'Clay', 'Bloberta', 'school', 'coach', 'Stopframe', 'Rev', 'Putty', 'others', 'Unfortunately', 'Orel', 'always', 'actions', 'mentors', 'who', 'are', 'mostly', 'shown', 'bitter', 'jaded', 'merely', 'paying', 'lip', 'service', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'misunderstandings', 'lead', 'comedy', 'show', 'young', 'Orel', 'believing', 'following', 'Lord', 'wishes', 'smoking', 'crack', 'reanimating', 'bodies', 'dead', 'townsfolk', 'practicing', 'euthanasia', 'end', 'show', 'Orel', 'misbehaviour', 'discovered', 'taken', 'father', 'study', 'lessons', 'father', 'are', ""n't"", 'what', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'however', 'Moral', 'Orel', 'once', 'parody', 'classic', 'values-based', 'programming', 'such', '1960s', 'series', 'Davey', 'Goliath', 'commentary', 'lip', 'service', 'paid', 'religion', 'society', 'large', 'modern', 'world.Season', 'one', 'include:1', 'Best', 'Christmas', 'Ever', 'Rev', 'Putty', 'Orel', 'Jesus', 'will', 'one', 'day', 'return', 'earth', 'younger', 'brother', 'Shapey', 'second', 'coming', 'Christ', 'Orel', 'parents', 'plan', 'divorce', 'Christmas', 'be', 'unhappy', 'one.2', 'Lord', 'Greatest', 'Gift', 'learning', 'God', 'greatest', 'gift', 'life', 'Orel', 'friend', 'Doughy', 'help', 'protect', 'gift', 'library', 'book', 'graveyard', 'full', 'dead', 'townsfolk', 'Orel', 'convictions', 'spell', 'trouble', 'population', 'Moralton.3', 'Waste', 'Orel', 'God', ""n't"", 'look', 'kindly', 'wasteful', 'lessons', 'Coach', 'Stopframe', 'father', 'out', 'two', 'goals', 'mind', 'Orel', 'must', 'stop', 'own', 'wastefulness', 'ensure', ""n't"", 'end', 'up', 'failure', 'father', 'predicts', 'him.4', 'Charity', 'Orel', 'God', 'present', 'everyone', 'everything', 'up', 'excusing', 'school', 'going', 'trip', 'town', 'believing', 'able', 'stop', 'people', 'sinning', 'heal', 'them.5', 'Omnipresence', 'Orel', 'God', 'present', 'everyone', 'everything', 'up', 'excusing', 'school', 'going', 'trip', 'town', 'believing', 'able', 'stop', 'people', 'sinning', 'heal', 'them.6', 'Blessed', 'Union', 'Orel', 'husbands', 'should', 'do', 'everything', 'can', 'keep', 'wives', 'happy', 'around', 'town', 'asks', 'women', 'including', 'mother', 'what', 'want.7', 'God-Fearing', 'Halloween', 'boring', 'Orel', 'when', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'fear', 'God', 'times', 'Hoping', 'get', 'scared', 'Orel', 'make', 'God', 'angry', 'breaking', '10', 'Commandments.8', 'Maturity', 'getting', 'shot', 'eye', 'Shapey', 'BB', 'gun', 'Orel', 'father', 'be', 'more', 'repsonsible', 'mature', 'order', 'learn', 'more', 'maturity', 'Orel', 'local', 'bar', 'drinks', 'alcohol', 'known', 'Maturity', 'Juice', '.9', 'Loyalty', 'running', 'Orel', 'church', 'Coach', 'Stopframe', 'Orel', 'would', 'become', 'Bible', 'Buddies', 'nephew', 'Joe', 'who', ""n't"", 'settled', 'christianity', 'yet', 'Joe', 'doing', 'bad', 'things', 'fun', 'Orel', 'should', 'be', 'loyal', 'friend', 'go', 'along', 'it.10', 'God', 'Chef', 'order', 'please', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'still', 'go', 'heaven', 'Orel', 'scheme', 'Moralton', 'topsy-turvy']","Moral Orel, Vol. 1, The Unholy Edition"

So Orel learns to turn his urine into an energy drink, resorts to masturbating into a pastry bag (a device which allows him to not ""spill his seed"" and also allows him to impregnate most of the town's women), uses the crack cocaine given to him in exchange for his charitable donation to a drug dealer. . .and his odd exploits innocently continue, always plausible, always funny.It isn't until a few shows into this collection of the first 15 episodes of ""Moral Orel"" that you start to also see the catalog of pain: the lonely alcoholic father; the lonely frigid housewife; the lonely gay high school coach; the lonely vain minister. . .Clearly, the only people enjoying themselves here are the children.
