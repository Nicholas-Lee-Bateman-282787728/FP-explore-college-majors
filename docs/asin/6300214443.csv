Christopher Walken takes you through a wide range of emotions as a reluctant psychic. The key to this film is the wonderful acting by all the players. Brooke Adams as the ex-girlfriend exudes the emotion of a woman with a confused heart in a way rarely seen on screen. The scene at the gazebo where Johnny Smith(Walken)might see the killer with his psychic abilities is astounding. The movie flows smoothly and gives you a clear understanding of how this type of psychic power affects moods, emotions and lives. Although not a big role, Martin Sheen as the sociopathic political wannabe is hands down his finest charactor. The saviour-like ending that precipitates world history is brilliant and mind blowing. Movies combining sci-fi and heart felt drama are hard to come by. This one has it all. Keep it in your DVD library. The dvd picture is decent but the sound could use improvement. A special edition containing the original movie poster artwork and many extras is greatly needed.

Falling in the same line as The Brood, Scanners, and Videodrome, The Dead Zone serves up a fascinating in-look of the telepathic powers while everything else around the character is rather ordinary. Christopher Walken, a terrific actor, gives a great performance in this one. The plot is excellent, giving a feel of David Cronenberg meets The Manchurian Candidate with an interesting twist in the end. There is an array of subplots within the plot, each being more interesting than the other. I liked the performance by others in the cast, and they do meet the standards of David Cronenberg.

212863,A30N4CJVI6U4XE,6300214443,"Chris Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[1, 1]","Like the first day of fall when the incessant heat breaks, the breeze unusually cool reminding you of past seasons, the spectacular imagination of Stephen King is once again ""en vogue."" The everyman author of Maine, perhaps the most prolific obsessive-compulsive writer in American history, has penned a sequel to ""The Shining"" (Doctor Sleep: A Novel), produced a hit TV series based on his entertaining 2009 novelUnder the Dome: A Noveland yet another remake, for whatever reason, has been forged from ""Carrie."" So bloggers and writers produce lists, endless lists, of the best film versions of Kings many books.His initial burst of creativity, erupting in 1974 with his debut novelCarrieand marching almost a decade with unparalleled success toPet Sematary, will never be matched again. It was during this span he wrote his greatest novel, which led to the best film ever made from one of his books.I have always argued King's greatest work was the quiet 1979 bestseller ""The Dead Zone (Signet). I'm not sure what it is about the book I return to so often. I saw the 1983 film version ""The Dead Zone"" the day it opened at a faceless multiplex theater in my college town in central Texas. To this day I remember the film's opening credits, the dark, cold landscape and the gentle chords of Michael Kamen's musical score. Filmed in Canada by master director David Cronenberg, it ranks as the greatest film version of a King novel -- sullen, contemplative and utterly brilliant.And so the lists, the endless lists, mention Stanley Kubrick'sThe Shining, Frank Darabont'sThe Shawshank Redemptionand Brian De Palma'sCarrie, but they almost always forget this film. While this is not Cronenberg's greatest work (Dead Ringersanyone?), it still has his thumbprint. Unlike Kubrick, he pays a respectful nod to King's novel. It is a unique meshing of larger-than-life visions, the end result an unusually melancholic horror classic.The key is Christopher Walken as Johnny Smith. A monumental acting talent (and eccentric), Walken's performance is his finest in a lead role. He plays an anguished, disturbed man who awakens from a five-year coma after a horrible car accident to discover he has profound psychic ability. This is not a gift  -- when the visions appear, they have all the pleasantry of a fierce migraine -- and he has to insulate himself within the safety of his parent's modest home.Walken's Smith has lost everything, including his career as a school teacher (King's job before being published) and his fiancee who has since married another man. His visions bring him brief fame and he must burrow from the spotlight. He's brought out of hiding by small-town Sheriff Bannerman (the perfectly cast Tom Skerritt) whose community has been preyed upon by an unknown serial killer. Prior to this, Smith's visions have happened by accident, and he now finds himself forced to use his cursed powers for intentional good.This extraordinary second act is the film's highlight, as Walken, adorned in black like a reluctant oracle, limps to a crime scene through ominous slush and snow. You're never sure a vision will come, and suddenly, he is standing with the victim as the murderer strolls towards her. The killer is local, and his ghastly demise, different from King's novel, is pure Cronenberg. That's as far as I am going to go, except it's an amazing moment of suspense and shock.A theme running throughout the film, also a Cronenberg touch, is the dysfunction of domineering parents. Smith's mother (Jackie Burroughs), radically religious, sees his visions as a gift from God, continually quoting scripture and forcing her vicarious hopes into his destroyed life. Colleen Dewhurst has a great cameo as the mother of the discovered killer, whose son is imprisoned within childhood. The great character actor Anthony Zerbe also does his usual fine work as an emotionally distant father concerned with business, hiring Smith as a tutor for his troubled son. Smith becomes a father-figure to the child, and with great insight, brings him out of his shell while providing worth to his own personal losses.But the true purpose of Smith's ""gift"" becomes apparent in the final act. I will not reveal too much suffice to say Smith is forced to attempt a political assassination to save the world. Just about everyone alive in 1963 was traumatized by the monumentally shocking assassination of President John F. Kennedy. King certainly was, and has referenced the tragedy multiple times in his works, not to mention coming full circle with the terrific 2011 book11/22/63: A Novel.Johnny Smith is not Lee Harvey Oswald, and the corrupt politician he stalks does not even remotely resemble Kennedy (though oddly, has much in common with politicians today). But what Oswald did with a below-average rifle is unthinkable, a single shot causing an epic tear in the fabric of human history. His motives will be forever unknown (thanks Jack Ruby), and such haunting ghosts float in the realm of supernatural ""what if?"" It's not hard to see where King came up with the inspirational seed. The difference between our imaginations and his, is that he can write a book as good as ""The Dead Zone,"" leading to Cronenberg's pensive and wonderful classic.",5,A Reluctant

212866,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,6300214443,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[90, 92]","For some reason, The Dead Zone has always been one of my least favorite Stephen King novels, but I have to say this movie adaptation of the novel is first-rate indeed, one of the most underappreciated of all the movies based on the work of the king of horror.  The film's success is due in large part to Christopher Walken; with a less capable actor filling the role of Johnny Smith, this movie could have turned out as flat as a pancake.  Walken, the consummate actor, is mesmerizing here.  It's a complex role to play, as Johnny Smith has not exactly been blessed by the kind hands of fate.  When we first meet him, he is a happy English teacher preparing to marry the woman he loves; a stormy night and a runaway milk tanker later, he wakes up to find that five years have passed, his girl has married someone else, and he is all but incapable of even walking.  If you think this is a film about eliminating a politician of great and destructive evil, you're not even half-right.  While that is of course the focus of the concluding minutes, the movie itself is all about Johnny's struggles to come to terms with his new life, a new life which includes a frightening power to see into the past and future of those whom he physically touches.  The first manifestation comes in handy, as he helps save a nurse's little girl from dying in a fire, but traumatic, soul-draining visions of horror take a lot out of a guy as time moves on.Johnny first comes to terms with his power when he agrees to help the police discover the identity of an elusive serial killer walking the streets of Castle Rock (which, for some strange reason, is supposedly located in New Hampshire rather than Maine).  This experience only makes him retreat farther into himself, compelling him to move to another town and try to begin a new life within the comfort of his own protective walls.  A traumatic vision concerning one of the students he is tutoring leads him to discover a new aspect of his power, and this discovery comes just in time for him to make a difficult decision as to whether or not to sacrifice his own life in order to prevent a truly cataclysmic event from taking place in the future.David Cronenberg directs this bleak but absorbing film, but don't expect the kind of gore Cronenberg is famous for, as this is not a gore-mired film by any means (although the deaths we do witness are pretty satisfyingly presented).  The Dead Zone is a psychological study of human nature and a suspenseful thriller, not a horror movie per se.  Martin Sheen leaves an unforgettable mark on the film with his portrayal of as slimy and dangerous a politician as you would ever want to meet (and, as a side note, impersonating Elvis Presley's voice apparently goes over big among New England voters for some reason).A lot of care and detail went into the making of The Dead Zone, and it shows.  The atmosphere is dark and palpable from start to finish, and Christopher Walken commands the viewer's rapt attention at all times.  There are a number of very moving scenes, particularly in relation to Johnny's new relationship with his former fianc&eacute;e, so don't be surprised if Walken coaxes a tear or two out of the corners of your eyes.  Many of the early movies based on King novels did not translate to the big screen very effectively, but The Dead Zone is an often overlooked and very impressive exception.",5,"A brilliant, underappreciated adaptation of King's novel",1070150400,"11 30, 2003",2003,3392,"['reason', 'Dead', 'Zone', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'least', 'favorite', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novels', 'have', 'say', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'novel', 'first-rate', 'indeed', 'one', 'most', 'underappreciated', 'movies', 'based', 'work', 'king', 'horror', 'film', 'success', 'due', 'large', 'part', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'less', 'capable', 'actor', 'filling', 'role', 'Johnny', 'Smith', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'turned', 'out', 'as', 'flat', 'pancake', 'Walken', 'consummate', 'actor', 'mesmerizing', 'here', 'complex', 'role', 'play', 'Johnny', 'Smith', 'not', 'exactly', 'been', 'blessed', 'kind', 'hands', 'fate', 'When', 'first', 'meet', 'happy', 'English', 'teacher', 'preparing', 'marry', 'woman', 'stormy', 'night', 'runaway', 'milk', 'tanker', 'later', 'up', 'find', 'five', 'years', 'have', 'passed', 'girl', 'married', 'someone', 'else', 'incapable', 'even', 'walking', 'think', 'film', 'eliminating', 'politician', 'great', 'destructive', 'evil', ""'re"", 'not', 'even', 'half-right', 'course', 'focus', 'concluding', 'minutes', 'movie', 'Johnny', 'struggles', 'come', 'terms', 'new', 'life', 'new', 'life', 'frightening', 'power', 'see', 'past', 'future', 'whom', 'physically', 'first', 'manifestation', 'handy', 'save', 'nurse', 'little', 'girl', 'dying', 'fire', 'traumatic', 'soul-draining', 'visions', 'horror', 'take', 'lot', 'guy', 'time', 'moves', 'on.Johnny', 'first', 'terms', 'power', 'when', 'help', 'police', 'discover', 'identity', 'elusive', 'serial', 'killer', 'walking', 'streets', 'Castle', 'Rock', 'strange', 'reason', 'supposedly', 'located', 'New', 'Hampshire', 'rather', 'Maine', 'experience', 'only', 'retreat', 'farther', 'compelling', 'move', 'town', 'try', 'begin', 'new', 'life', 'comfort', 'own', 'protective', 'walls', 'A', 'traumatic', 'vision', 'concerning', 'one', 'students', 'tutoring', 'discover', 'new', 'aspect', 'power', 'discovery', 'just', 'time', 'make', 'difficult', 'decision', 'not', 'sacrifice', 'own', 'life', 'order', 'prevent', 'truly', 'cataclysmic', 'event', 'taking', 'place', 'future.David', 'Cronenberg', 'bleak', 'absorbing', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'kind', 'gore', 'Cronenberg', 'famous', 'not', 'gore-mired', 'film', 'means', 'deaths', 'do', 'are', 'pretty', 'satisfyingly', 'presented', 'Dead', 'Zone', 'psychological', 'study', 'human', 'nature', 'suspenseful', 'thriller', 'not', 'horror', 'movie', 'se', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'unforgettable', 'mark', 'film', 'portrayal', 'slimy', 'dangerous', 'politician', 'would', 'ever', 'want', 'meet', 'side', 'note', 'impersonating', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'voice', 'apparently', 'over', 'big', 'New', 'England', 'voters', 'reason', '.A', 'lot', 'care', 'detail', 'went', 'making', 'Dead', 'Zone', 'atmosphere', 'dark', 'palpable', 'start', 'finish', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'viewer', 'rapt', 'attention', 'times', 'are', 'number', 'very', 'moving', 'scenes', 'particularly', 'relation', 'Johnny', 'new', 'relationship', 'former', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'Walken', 'coaxes', 'tear', 'two', 'corners', 'eyes', 'Many', 'early', 'movies', 'based', 'King', 'novels', 'did', 'not', 'translate', 'big', 'screen', 'very', 'effectively', 'Dead', 'Zone', 'often', 'overlooked', 'very', 'impressive', 'exception']",N/A

But unfortunately his filmography can not be compared with theirs. With the exception of Abel Ferrara and Michael Cimino, few leading american directors have used his talent. Too bad.So we must enjoy again and again his terrific performance in THE DEAD ZONE, a movie directed by canadian director David Cronenberg in 1983. If we still remember this picture, it's essentially due to Walken's character, a teacher who awakens from a 5 years coma with a psychic ability. Well, let's be objective, the technical skill of Cronenberg is also to be praised. The scenes showing Walken going into a trance deserve to stay in the movie annals. The picture is also giving us the opportunity to admire Brooke Adams, an actress who had the same kind of career than Walken's : two or three masterpieces like Terrence Malick's DAYS OF HEAVEN and a lot of forgettable films.Nothing special about the DVD.

""The Dead Zone"" falls in the category of slightly above average thanks to the stellar direction of horror-meister David Cronenberg and a top-notch cast led by Christopher Walken.  There were moments of deja vu here where I felt the film was derivative of a ""Twilight Zone"" or ""Outer Limits"" episode but there's also some genuine inspired moments as well.  King has some interesting things to say about telepathy and the responsiblities of those imbued with it.

Told at a leisurely pace initially, the film allows the tension to build, and features one of the best performances of Christopher Walken's career. He plays the central character in the story, with a haunted and understated performance that allows you to empathise with, and pity the agonies his character has to endure.  There are strong performances all round, with director Cronenberg keeping a close rein on all his performers, with the exception of Martin Sheen who has to play his character as 'barking' in a few key scenes.  The film is shot with a minimalist style right through, and even the music beautifully evokes the impending sense of tragedy that we can all feel coming. I remember seeing the film for the first time nearly fifteen years ago, and I hadn't read the book. Today, shock endings are almost expected, with 'The Sixth Sense' being one of the most notable examples. The ending to this film still leaves me tingling, as it did when I first saw it all those years ago. I just didn't see it coming, and it remains to me one of the most poignant bittersweet endings in cinema.  I was delighted when this film was released onto DVD, as my old VHS copy was getting a tad grainy. Now I can watch one of my favourite all-time movies over and over with no deterioration in picture or sound quality.  This film is one of those little gems that tend to lie undiscovered in the video store, with most patrons passing it over as 'just another Stephen King movie.' It isn't. This is probably cleverer than 'The Sixth Sense' ( Where I always felt the ending owed more to the ending in James Herbert's 'The Survivor' than anything else - I actually guessed the ending before seeing the film!) and definitely more heart-breaking.

He collides with a semi-trailer, and wakes in a clinic (Cronenberg loves a clinic: The Keloid Clinic in Rabid, Dr Raglan's clinic in The Brood, the Mantle twins' practice in Dead Ringers) run by the kindly Dr Weizak (Herbert Lom, the guy with the twitch from the Pink Panther movies). Johnny has been in a coma for five years, and in that time the odd headaches he had before his accident have developed into a full scale psychic ability. This gift is wide ranging, and allows him simply by grasping someone's hand to see their past or future, or even to see contemporaneous perils at a distance: he sends a nurse to rescue her daughter from a house fire, after a nifty vision of the kid's goldfish being boiled alive in its tank. Johnny learns that Sarah has remarried (he was only in a coma: she couldn't wait?), and has to decide whether to accept sheriff Tom Skerritt's invitation to lend his powers to the investigation of a serial killer. A politician (Martin Sheen) is campaigning in town, and Johnny's powers reveal something about the man that he feels he can't ignore.I was expecting something scary from this adaptation of Stephen King's novel (the King of Horror meets the Master of Venereal Horror - how can that not add up to extra horror?), but instead The Dead Zone presents a supernatural/science fiction story, which shifts between sadness (although often in a movie of the week way, with syrupy music cues telling us just how cut up John is about losing impatient Sarah), and visions which can be startling but hardly chilling. Cronenberg's delight in detailing injuries means that Walken looks pretty authentically banged up after his accident, but a bloody scene with the serial killer shows how amateurish '80s horror looks next to more recent examples of the genre.Walken's eccentric screen persona was already established by 1983, and his strange intensity compensates for some of the film's failings. He first appears with enormous spectacles and hair combed forward, in an unconvincing and temporary attempt at normality, but awakens from his coma with the familiar vertically-brushed style, all the better perhaps to catch the psychic emanations (as Danny says in Withnail & I, &#34;Hair is our antenna&#34;). Brooke Adams is wan, and like all the cast, her unruly eyebrows and lack of cosmetic alteration highlight just how unfeasibly normal people looked in mainstream American films between the mid-'60s and early '90s. Martin Sheen has one excellent scene, in which he launches into a Tea Party-style rant against the unemployed, but then escalates into Snidely Whiplash-style histrionics.The truly shocking part of this film is the wardrobe. I have never seen so many cardigans on screen together in my life; I've never seen so many cardies together anywhere, and I've visited nursing homes. Cable knits, zips, those leather buttons; it's breathtaking. Herbert Lom wears some kind of cross between Basil Rathbone's overcoat and a horse blanket.  And it doesn't stop there. Walken spends an indecent amount of time in some kind of chenille dressing gown striped in yellow, russet and a muddy tan. Another character is so dumbstruck by the consequences of failing to heed one of Johnny's prophecies that he sits inert in a vivid blue dressing gown of his own, and Sheen is at his most apocalyptically megalomaniacal in a fancy matching stripy pajama and dressing gown combo, unbuttoned to display gratuitous amounts of silver chest hair. The serial killer's bedroom, where he lives in his mother's house, is decorated with a cowboy print wallpaper which I took to be an expression of his regressed and deranged mind, but two subsequent rooms, including the eminently sane Dr Weizak's, have wallpapers even more hideous to behold.

It's simply a character study of Johnny Smith (Christopher Walken), a guy with headaches who flips his car one night and five years later wakes from a coma to a new life with one aggravating drawback, clairvoyance.  From that point, his tale of woe progresses slowly with episodic regularity, broken down into abrupt scattershot scenes that introduces then dismisses a lot of potentially interesting characters.  This fractured approach doesn't lend itself well when it comes to propelling the plot to its irrevocable showdown.  There's actually very little in the way of agonizing over what would/should be a moral dilemma.  This makes one wonder what was in Johnny Smith that made that choice such an easy one.As expected, there's another unflattering portrait of an overtly religious mother (a shame to waste the considerable talents of Jackie Burroughs in such a trivializing role), and the usual rant against God.  Stephen King is nothing if not predictable.  Also shamefully wasted in a nothing role, the incomparable Colleen Dewhurst (any yahoo off the street could have done this blink-and-you'd-miss it part).  Herbert Lom was suitably concerned; Anthony Zerbe was expectedly rancorous.  Christopher Walken was incredible in a heartbreaking role.  But, despite David Cronenberg's overbearing insistence otherwise, Martin Sheen's performance was outlandishly cartoonish and way over the top.

An upbeat, happy teacher (Christopher Walken) in love with another at the same school (Brooke Adams) is put into a coma after a horrific car accident. The two of them had been close to marriage, making this all the more tragic. The next scene shows him waking up miraculously. But he soon learns that 5 years have passed, and that his fiancee has married another man, believing his coma would be permanent. Somehow, the result of the coma leaves him with a new and upsetting power--he can sense the past, the present, and the future of others merely by touching them.  While he sees this as a curse, he begins to learn that it can be helpful, even to the point of saving lives.  Starting as a subplot, the story moves forward with a ruthlessly ambitious American politician (Martin Sheen) who has his eyes on the White House. For those who know their history, he is the USA's Hitler, intending to start a nuclear war after capturing the devotion of the populace by appealing to the jobless and a law and order theme (just as AH did).  Walken goes out of his way to shake his hand, and that is when he has the horrific vision that would come true if this dangerous man would be elected. He therefore has a moral dilemna involving what to do. The two stories meld when we discover that his former fiancee is now high up in the politician's campaign entourage.

212895,A3USRUCHAOC3MT,6300214443,"Indiana Jeff Reynolds ""Preacher Jeff""","[2, 3]","David Cromemberg did an excellent job with the adaptation of Stephen King's novel, and Christopher Walken was superb in his portrayal of Johnny Smith (no middle initial).  The supporting cast added to the film:  Martin Sheen was a convincing Greg Stilson (was this a warm up for his West Wing role?), I'm a big fan of Tom Skerritt, and I didn't recognize Herbert Lom from his Pink Panther role.This movie (and the book) are put in the horror genre, but I would consider the story to be true science fiction.  Smith's character was in a coma for several years, and the story's premise is that this coma enabled his brain to tap into psychic ablilities.  There is nothing supernatural about the villains; they're just normal bad people.This movie is not completely faithful to the movie.  Some of the changes are to make it fit a moderately lengthed movie (104 minutes) instead of a 400+ page novel.  Some of the changes add moderate suspense, keeping the interest of someone who read the novel first.  I do question the need for some of the changes -- I don't know why Johnny Smith's psychic abilities required personal contact in the movie (he could learn things touching people's clothes or a geographic spot in the book), and I didn't think it was necessary of having his tutoree be a younger boy in the movie instead of a teenager as in the book (this made for what I considered weaker parts of the movie).True science fiction is effective because it takes a normal person, puts them in an abnormal situation, and thus investigates the person's character.  Due to the time constraints of the movie, it did not as effectively deal with the wrestlings of conscience Smith had, but they were not absent either.  As a result, the story (both book and movie) have a feel of a classic tragedy.This movie is not for children, though it could have easily gained a PG rating (this movie came out the year before PG-13 was introduced).  The R rating was gained by one usage of the F-word, a couple of seconds of a revealed breast, and a short gruesome scene involving the death of a character.  (Cromemberg has a reputation for gruesomeness in his other movies, like ""Scanners"", ""Videodrome"", and the 1986 remake of ""The Fly""; this movie had him more subdued, but very effective.)Besides the R-rating, there are aspects of the story (equally true in the novel as in the movie) that I find disturbing as a fundamentalist minister.  This is because of its dependence on situation ethics.  Adultery and murder are considered acceptable on the part of Johnny Smith because of the situations.In spite of these misgivings, I think this was an excellent movie.  I think it was worthy of several awards, such as acting nominations for Walken and Sheen, for adapted screenplay, and for best picture.",5,An Excellent Adaptation of an Excellent Novel.,1167177600,"12 27, 2006",2006,2783,"['David', 'Cromemberg', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'adaptation', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novel', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'was', 'superb', 'portrayal', 'Johnny', 'Smith', 'middle', 'initial', 'supporting', 'cast', 'added', 'film', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'was', 'convincing', 'Greg', 'Stilson', 'was', 'warm', 'up', 'West', 'Wing', 'role', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'Tom', 'Skerritt', 'did', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'Herbert', 'Lom', 'Pink', 'Panther', 'role.This', 'movie', 'book', 'are', 'put', 'horror', 'genre', 'would', 'consider', 'story', 'be', 'true', 'science', 'fiction', 'Smith', 'character', 'was', 'coma', 'several', 'years', 'story', 'premise', 'coma', 'enabled', 'brain', 'tap', 'psychic', 'ablilities', 'nothing', 'supernatural', 'villains', ""'re"", 'just', 'normal', 'bad', 'people.This', 'movie', 'not', 'completely', 'faithful', 'movie', 'changes', 'are', 'make', 'fit', 'moderately', 'lengthed', 'movie', '104', 'minutes', 'instead', '400+', 'page', 'novel', 'changes', 'add', 'moderate', 'suspense', 'keeping', 'interest', 'someone', 'who', 'read', 'novel', 'first', 'do', 'question', 'need', 'changes', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'Johnny', 'Smith', 'psychic', 'abilities', 'required', 'personal', 'contact', 'movie', 'could', 'learn', 'things', 'touching', 'people', 'clothes', 'geographic', 'spot', 'book', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'necessary', 'having', 'tutoree', 'be', 'younger', 'boy', 'movie', 'instead', 'teenager', 'book', 'made', 'what', 'considered', 'weaker', 'parts', 'movie', 'science', 'fiction', 'effective', 'normal', 'person', 'abnormal', 'situation', 'thus', 'person', 'character', 'Due', 'time', 'constraints', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'effectively', 'deal', 'wrestlings', 'conscience', 'Smith', 'had', 'were', 'not', 'absent', 'either', 'result', 'story', 'book', 'movie', 'have', 'feel', 'classic', 'tragedy.This', 'movie', 'not', 'children', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'gained', 'PG', 'rating', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'year', 'PG-13', 'was', 'introduced', 'R', 'rating', 'was', 'gained', 'one', 'usage', 'F-word', 'couple', 'seconds', 'revealed', 'breast', 'short', 'gruesome', 'scene', 'involving', 'death', 'character', 'Cromemberg', 'reputation', 'gruesomeness', 'other', 'movies', 'Scanners', 'Videodrome', '1986', 'remake', 'Fly', 'movie', 'had', 'more', 'subdued', 'very', 'effective', 'R-rating', 'are', 'aspects', 'story', 'equally', 'true', 'novel', 'movie', 'find', 'disturbing', 'fundamentalist', 'minister', 'dependence', 'situation', 'ethics', 'Adultery', 'murder', 'are', 'considered', 'acceptable', 'part', 'Johnny', 'Smith', 'situations.In', 'spite', 'misgivings', 'think', 'was', 'excellent', 'movie', 'think', 'was', 'worthy', 'several', 'awards', 'such', 'acting', 'nominations', 'Walken', 'Sheen', 'adapted', 'screenplay', 'best', 'picture']",N/A

Easily ranks with Stand By Me, The Green Mile, and The Shawshank Redemption as one of the best Steven King adaptations on film.No, it doesn't follow the book exactly... but what film ever does?  Get it through your heads, folks-- it's impossible to duplicate ANY book in a 1-1/2 to 2 hour film! (except maybe a comic book)  The best you can hope for with any book-to-movie adaptation is that the acting, directing, music, and cinematography will convey the spirit and mood of the story, without going to ridiculous, hollywood-esque special-effects lengths to do it.And this flick is a moody masterpiece, very true to the Stephen King type atmosphere... but without much of the graphic gore that he tends to employ.  If you're looking for a blood-spattering slasher-type flick, this one ain't for you.  But if you like intelligent, well-acted and directed thrillers, then by all means get it and watch it!With an absolutely haunting score by Michael Kamen!Oh, and don't even talk to me about that insipid TV series/spinoff... it doesn't hold a candle to this great movie.-------------------------------------------------------------------------P.S.

The exceptions are &quot;Christine,&quot; &quot;Misery,&quot; and the best, &quot;The Dead Zone.&quot; David Cronenberg, a master director of  horror, quirky and sometimes over the top, directs &quot;The Dead  Zone&quot; with a sure hand. Christopher Walken, playing mostly villains  the last few years, wonderfully plays an awkward, compassionate school  teacher, crippled and put in a coma by an auto wreck, then wakes, having  lost his love but gaining insight into the future. This kind of thing has,  frankly, been overdone in the movies, but here the story's line is so  clear, the acting so good, that we forget that it is a supernatural  thriller and we become involved with these all too human characters. There  are some baroque touches,such as the Frank Dodd suicide, somewhat gratuitus  compared to the rest of the film's images. Cronenberg's best work, I feel,  is when he is not trying to be too far out, which means most of his films  after this one. &quot;The Fly&quot; was another masterpiece and again  Cronenberg was reined in a little. Cronenberg directs and gives this  &quot;quiet&quot; horror film a savage beauty, so when the climaxes and  surpizes come, they are all the more powerful. This is a great film of any  genre and I think Cronenberg's best work. &quot;The Dead Zone,&quot; will  last longer than his more recent, &quot;controversial&quot; films such as  &quot;Crash.&quot; He has this obsession with the body and the machine and  still makes movies exploring his own demons. Some of these explorations are  interesting but ultimately boring for such a wonderfully talented director,  one of the best in the horror or any genre.

After a near death accident, and 5 years in a coma, he is given powers to see things that has happened in the past and that which may happen in the future.His visions saves a girl from burning in a fire, is able to help his doctor contact his mother who he thought was dead in WW II, help the police find a serial killer, and is able to prevent a boy he is tutoring from going ice skating which would have led to his death by falling through the ice.The age old question is can a person with these kind of powers intervene into history to change it? The big test comes when Walken decides to use his powers to stop a candidate for the Presidency who is seen as one day going to push the nuclear button.

212914,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,6300214443,K. Driscoll,"[8, 9]","David Cronenberg directs the Stephen King novel about a man who awakes from a coma with a life draining ability to see future tragedies when making contact with people. He also finds he can change these morbid outcomes. The screenplay (not written by Cronenberg or King) remains the films only real flaw besides some questionable supporting cast members. The novel is not a book that would make a perfect story to tell on film so the screenplay sort of stays in the shallow end and spits forth each episode that our hero Johnny Smith expereinces one at a time and without the level of understanding and depth King's book has. That is not to say The Dead Zone isn't a good movie.  It's actually a very good movie.The film remains a semi-classic in the suspense genre. Cronenberg has a way of handling scenes that is very European despite lacking the technical skills of his peers. He can give the actors very specific emotional direction and tell so much with using little or no dialogue. This helps the screenplay because it only offers some flashes of great dialogue. Cronenberg loves taking on films that lack certain aspects and giving them depth in places you never thought could have it. He is a unique force in independant films and earns his stars among the mainstream fans with this film. Martin Sheen surprisingly gives a solid performance here as well. He plays a crooked politician bent on gaining the presidency and earns our hatred quickly. He is actually quite remarkable here.O.K., now it's time to play favorites. Johnny Smith is played by one of the most identifiable actors of all time. The greatest character and supporting acting of all time in my eyes and here we see him in a rare feature role. He is Christopher Walken and with all the imitations of his wild talk and bizarre off-screen shenanigans aside, he is quite simply an amazing actor. He takes his role very seriously here and turns the film from mediocrity into a very good movie. He takes the character for what readers may have loved about him and that is that he is your every day guy who happened upon some very usual and at times deeply sad circumstances...it just wasn't in the cards or it wasn't meant to be like Smith's Doctor felt. For those who read the novel you'll see subtle references to some of the more robust thinking in the story but never quite enough. There is an underlying message in the film that I really wish wasn't somewhat lost among the communication of the screenplay and the direction. King's novel touches on these things tremendously well and makes us question fate and wonder if time and death is really just so one-dimensional. The film makes you think if you want it to, but not like the novel which is truly one of King's greatest. I honestly believe Walken may have been the only guy on the set who understood this about the story.If you are looking for a film full of suspense and several exciting climaxes and you like Christopher Walken, then I highly recommend The Dead Zone...but keep in mind that so few King novels have been done real justice with a film and where this is probably not one of them it remains a very good movie.

212916,A2NJO6YE954DBH,6300214443,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 6]","The 1983 theatrical version of ""The Dead Zone"" directed by David Cronenberg is probably the most disappointing film adaptation of a Stephen King novel that I have seen, mainly because I had such heightened expectations.  The novel was one of my favorite King novels and the only one that I have taught in class a couple of times (for quite different reasons) and when I first saw this film I knew exactly what went wrong.  This will surprise a lot of you, but I thought casting Christopher Walken as Johnny Smith was a big mistake.  I seem to remember somebody calling Walken the King of Weird (or maybe it was Prince) and when you take a weird guy like Walken and give him a weird power, such as psychic ability, it is just too weird.  One of the reasons the character has the name that he has is because it was important to the story that the person that this happens to is basically an ordinary guy.  Casting Walken, who is a remarkable actor, simply throws this idea away.Beyond the lead we are talking about a pretty good supporting cast, with Martin Sheen doing dark side political candidate Greg Stillson, and ""Ice Castle"" stars Tom Skerritt and Colleen Dewhurst reunited as Sheriff Bannerman and Henrietta Dodd.  But I think a lot of the other casting is a bit off too, with Herbert Lom as Sam Weizak and Anthony Zerbe as Roger Stuart, so I get the feeling Cronenberg was trying to do something on purpose here.  Certainly you can argue it provides a sense of uneasy because so many people are trying to play against type.Believe me, I know this is the minority opinion on this film, but this film just falls short for me.  Jeffrey Boam's script comes up with some cinematic ways of presenting Johnny's visions that works well (and which has been exploited to great visual effects in the USA television series version of ""The Dead Zone"").  The film does not emphasize the logic of the string of situations that convince Johnny that he can change the future and do something about Stilson the way the novel does, but again that might just be my heightened sensitivity to what I consider the strength of King's novel.The best part of the film is the entire Castle Rock episode, with Johnny helping the skeptical but desperate Bannerman to end the killings in his town.  Of course, this episode is helped by this being the one with Skerritt and Dewhurst.

212921,A3AN0NXHARI55Q,6300214443,Magic Lemur,"[0, 0]","Although Stephen King is a truly great author, there are occasions when his stuff isn't quite magic. This film has two excellent scenes, which raise it above other films, but otherwise it is sadly dated and not as classic as some might suggest.Basically the plot is that Christopher Walken has an accident, goes into a coma, then gains the ability of second sight (or scrying - the ability to see the future). There are interesting elements to the story, such as the eerie inclusion of the book 'Sleepy Hollow' - which Walken later played theheadless horsemanin, and lots of Edgar Allan Poe poetry (which is excellent stuff for creating creepy atmospherics).Unfortunately though, much of the film does not have much to underpin it or compel repeat viewings and Walken isn't as spell-binding as he later turned out to be inPulp Fiction.That is, until he meets a future candidate for the presidency. This clip has been regularly cited in other media as it is probably the most definitive clip of the 'nutter with his finger on the nuclear button'. It also shows Martin Sheen in one of his best performances outside ofApocalypse Now.The second clip that is excellent is the ending. Not quite as classic as the Martin Sheen bit, it still has an excellent plot twist which makes it worth sitting through an otherwise run-of-the-mill thriller.All in all then this film is worth watching, but is far from being an outright classic. Still, it has some interesting themes (which are similar in many ways to those ofTaxi Driver [1976]) and it is also well worth watching to see one of Martin Sheen's best performances.As a final note, if you're looking for 80's films in a similar vein to this that are still classics (in my opinion), then I recommend the following two films:First, there isThe Evil Dead [1982] (if you haven't seen it, then you should definitely watch it before this).Second, there isRe-Animator [1985] - proof that Stephen King isn't the only author who wrote forgotten masterpieces...",4,Great moments but not quite a great film...,1286236800,"10 5, 2010",2010,1994,"['Stephen', 'King', 'truly', 'great', 'author', 'are', 'occasions', 'when', 'stuff', ""n't"", 'quite', 'magic', 'film', 'two', 'excellent', 'scenes', 'raise', 'other', 'films', 'sadly', 'dated', 'not', 'as', 'classic', 'might', 'suggest.Basically', 'plot', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'accident', 'coma', 'then', 'gains', 'ability', 'second', 'sight', 'scrying', 'ability', 'see', 'future', 'are', 'interesting', 'elements', 'story', 'such', 'eerie', 'inclusion', 'book', 'Hollow', 'Walken', 'later', 'played', 'theheadless', 'horsemanin', 'lots', 'Edgar', 'Allan', 'Poe', 'poetry', 'excellent', 'stuff', 'creating', 'creepy', 'atmospherics', '.Unfortunately', 'much', 'film', 'not', 'have', 'much', 'underpin', 'compel', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'Walken', ""n't"", 'as', 'spell-binding', 'later', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'inPulp', 'Fiction.That', 'future', 'candidate', 'presidency', 'clip', 'been', 'regularly', 'cited', 'other', 'media', 'probably', 'most', 'definitive', 'clip', ""'nutter"", 'finger', 'nuclear', 'button', 'also', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'ofApocalypse', 'Now.The', 'second', 'clip', 'excellent', 'ending', 'Not', 'quite', 'as', 'classic', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'bit', 'still', 'excellent', 'plot', 'twist', 'worth', 'sitting', 'otherwise', 'run-of-the-mill', 'thriller.All', 'then', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'far', 'being', 'outright', 'classic', 'Still', 'interesting', 'themes', 'are', 'similar', 'many', 'ways', 'ofTaxi', 'Driver', '[', '1976', ']', 'also', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'see', 'one', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'best', 'performances.As', 'final', 'note', ""'re"", 'looking', '80', 'films', 'similar', 'vein', 'are', 'still', 'classics', 'opinion', 'then', 'recommend', 'following', 'two', 'films', 'First', 'isThe', 'Evil', 'Dead', '[', '1982', ']', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'then', 'should', 'definitely', 'watch', '.Second', 'isRe-Animator', '[', '1985', ']', 'proof', 'Stephen', 'King', ""n't"", 'only', 'author', 'who', 'wrote', 'forgotten', 'masterpieces']",N/A

212925,A2NC5BMF6QWC5B,6300214443,Mark Laflamme,"[5, 5]","A novel as powerful as ""The Dead Zone"" requires a powerful cast to make it on the screen. And with the clever combination of Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen, Tom Skerrit and several other notables, this movie proves to be perhaps the best film adaptation of a Stephen King work.It begins with a spellbinding story. When Stephen King has a great idea, he does not squander it. Many writers have tackled the concept of precognition, but few have done is so masterfully. ""The Dead Zone"" is full of thrills, mayhem and wow moments while King is still getting warmed up.When Johnny Smith wakes up from a five year coma, he is endowed with the gift of second sight. By touching another person or a simple item, he is treated to the vision of a future event. The sky is the limit with such a concept, and King does not leave any piece of that sky unexplored.The John Smith character is supremely likeable and sympathetic. Walken is not the first person to come to mind. But he handles the role beautifully, and he immediately becomes the sad and ponderous character King invented in the novel.Before the midway point of the movie, Johnny is saving people from house fires, reuniting a mother and son, and steering youngsters away from a horrible skating accident that has not happened yet. The movie goer has his money's worth before this flick is half done. Each character is vivid and dynamic, particularly those of Smith and a certain politician named Greg Stinson, played to precise evil by Sheen.The second half of the movie is no less exciting but profoundly more significant as the story unfolds. Tampering with the future is an endeavor fraught with peril, as any fan of physics can tell you. Johnny is confronted by such a challenge, forced to choose between accepting the fate of the world or embracing his gift and using it to change the future. There is a serial killer to sniff out, and even that is not as vital as his next step, which involves a truly demented man who will one day be president.The finally act can be summarized by the question: ""If you could go back and time, knowing what you know about Adolph [...], would you kill him?""This is one of those rare movies that compliments the novel that came before it. If you've read the book, rush out and watch the movie. If you haven't read the book, you need to take a week off to fit them both in.",5,You will love this movie.

(The scenes showing his vision of the fire, with melting crayons and a boiling fish bowl, are appropriately apocalyptic.)One change i do regret, though i can understand why it was probably done, results in the elimination of the book's two page cameo appearance by Tom Fury, the lightning-rod salesman from Bradbury's ""Something Wicked This Way Comes"".  (Wonder how many people i just sent back to the book to look for that, heh.)And the dilemma Johnny faces, unable to explain to anyone else what he has seen, wondering whether to take direct action to prevent the ultimate disaster he has seen that follows Greg Stillson's election as President, knowing that he may be hallucinating, makes for admirable tension and suspense.",4,An excellent adaptation of King's least typical novel,1141344000,"03 3, 2006",2006,1272,"['Probably', 'best', 'King', 'adaptation', 'terms', 'accuracy', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'Christine', 'favorite', 'king', 'film', 'overall', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'like', 'King', 'much', 'overall', 'book', '[', ']', 'least', 'typical', 'caught', 'held', 'beginning', 'film', 'same', 'minor', 'changes', 'are', 'perfectly', 'acceptable', 'given', 'film', 'books', 'are', 'two', 'different', 'mediums', 'what', 'one', 'might', 'look', 'silly', 'other', 'what', 'well', 'might', 'read', 'ludicrously', 'spirit', 'narrative', 'drive', 'King', 'thriller', 'are', 'perfectly', 'maintained', 'scenes', 'showing', 'vision', 'fire', 'melting', 'crayons', 'boiling', 'fish', 'bowl', 'are', 'appropriately', 'apocalyptic', 'One', 'change', 'i', 'do', 'regret', 'i', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'was', 'probably', 'done', 'results', 'elimination', 'book', 'two', 'page', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'Tom', 'Fury', 'lightning-rod', 'salesman', 'Bradbury', 'Something', 'Wicked', 'Way', 'Comes', 'Wonder', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'i', 'just', 'sent', 'back', 'book', 'look', 'heh', 'dilemma', 'Johnny', 'unable', 'explain', 'anyone', 'else', 'what', 'seen', 'wondering', 'take', 'direct', 'action', 'prevent', 'ultimate', 'disaster', 'seen', 'Greg', 'Stillson', 'election', 'President', 'knowing', 'may', 'be', 'hallucinating', 'admirable', 'tension', 'suspense']",N/A

Like the above Amazon review states, with a lineup like this you'd expect a horror movie chock full of all the blood and gore you can handle, but instead the Dead Zone is an amazingly creepy and heart wrenching tale, starring Christopher Walken in one of his finest performances as Johnny Smith; who awakens from a coma to find that he has acquired an ability that allows him to see horrible past and possible future events just by touching someone.  Most of the film deals with Smith's inner struggle at his dilemma, before concluding with a face off against a shady politician (Martin Sheen).

Whats handled nicely here is the responsibility of precognitive dreams.  It could've simply been about him seeing things and doing something but this makes them more complex than that as it works to deal with the ramifications of all of this ability.  In someways this is about the web that permeates from our lives to that of others and how we're only a few people away from destruction, how we're linked to darkness in ways we don't even suspect.  I think that this and the Shining take the best look into someone having an odd ability an dthe personal price that wroughts.  Whats nice about Stephen King's concept is that  it pretty much came off here.  Perhaps what works best in his films is the lack of special effects.  To try and produce them with tends to disrupt the flow of the movie.  Here Walken's acting and Brooke Adams make a tragic couple who's lives were interrupted for a number of years by his coma but ultimately their love is the sacrifice to save the world from Martin Sheen.

212939,AJUEE2C2EJ0V3,6300214443,Paperbackstash,"[1, 1]","It's  been a few years since I had visited the ""Dead Zone"", and I decided another meet up was long overdue. I figured this long away from a role played by the great Christophen Walken was almost a sin, and I needed to hurry up and remedy this error before lightning struck me flat on my back.Was the meet  up as heavenly as I had hoped? Well, sort of. I was blessed with the sight of Walkens face and he brought character to the role of Johnny more than any mere mortal could. Everything he did was dead on; from the straight face to the creepy and morbid dialogue, and even dead pan humor, was pure bliss. Where the Dead Zone got knocked down a few steps was in other areas.Before going off into the review, I'll sum up the plot briefly. After an accident, schoolteacher Johnny Smith is sentenced to a five year coma. After waking, he finds that the love of his life remarried and has a kid. (not his) He is also cursed with an extraordinary power that works when it wants. This power allows him to see the future and the horrible things that could/would happen in it. But since he can see that far ahead, can he stop those events before they occur?As with much of the TV show, Johnny despises his gift because it only greets him with horrid visions. Not only that, but his leg is screwed up and there are signs that the 'visions' may be killing him. The people in town that don't think he is a joke fear him, and the ones that don't believe in his visions scoff him. Burned out on human nature in general, he must find the most peaceful life he can, but soon he finds that peace for him is impossible.I'll admit that visiting a few of the Dead Zone shows sparked my memory of this movie, and then when the Dead Zone film was over and the credits were rolling, I thought it would be better to see the film before the TV series. If you're used to the series, it hurts to see the film as there are so many differences you cant help comparing it to. The show also has more drama and action per hour than this did per 2 hours, causing a slower moving flick that was more psychologically drenched than it was visually exciting. The show may spoil someone if they hadn't seen this one beforehand. Yet, strangely enough, if you hadn't seen any of the shows or the movie, and saw the film first, you wouldn't be as disappointed and would still be able to jump into the series and enjoy it as well. Strange how these things happen, huh?Before I continue on with this review, I must again touch upon the best part of it: Walken. That makes seeing this movie at least once worth it alone. The second winner? The plot. The idea is outrageously different and wonderfully fascinating. Now of days, after so many themes and twists have evolved from it, it doesn't seem as nifty as it must have then, but the idea there is a damn good one. Even if there's nothing overtly creepy about the flick, something menacing can still be felt swimming under screen. It's dark as dust, too, with the talk of the reporter's sister's suicide (Walker at work again), and the fire scene in the hospital. Depressing and real to life, the ending fits the whole tone of the movie. It starts off depressing, and it ends depressing, as it should.While Cronenberg's adaptation is consistent, it isn't always the fastest moving thing. The pace wasn't downright dull, but it could have been spruced up with a bit more 'action and discovery.' Walken's moping and wallowing is understandable and not overdone enough to scratch the nerve endings, but more ""death and drama"", especially in terms of visions, would have been welcomed. Also, it sucked they didn't choose to flesh out more on Sarah and Johnny's relationship. What's there is scattered and didn't give me enough heart string tugging.Acting helped on all sides. I wont mention Walken again (oops, just did), but have to touch upon two other great joys. Martin Sheens character was surprising; he likes playing the powerful man in charge gone bad. It reminded me of another little flick he did, also by King, Firestarter. Here he's even more twisted and after a bigger picture - the presidency eventually. He brings an excellent feel to the role and I loved him watching him play out his 'dirty deeds.' A hysterical part of the film was the desperate measures he took to save himself toward the end. Pure humor there. (All demented fans will think so anyway). The second  delicious flavor? Tom Skerritt. Like the rest, this man is gold. He's a highly underrated actor and has always been one of my favorites. He brings genuine feeling to the role of the sheriff. Here is another similarity I wished the show and movie had in common more. If you're seeing the TV series first, then you're used to the melodrama of Johnny's lost love having hitched the good old boy sheriff when he traveled to coma-ville. Here I kept expecting Johnny to discover that the sheriff was his love objects hubby, but alas, no discovery was made. My memory didn't remember the facts of the film, apparently. Cronenberg may have taken some advice from the TV directors in this case; it's a fantastic twist.Cronenberg's style bleeds through; everything's cheerfully serious. As a  bit of trivia, the late Debra Hill was the producer of this film; her talent will almost be missed. The flick may please King fans, as well, as it's faithful to the novel. Fans of show may not be as happy, though. Overall, as a movie that stands on its own, it does its job well. King's book was dark and depressing, and so was Cronenberg's film. The acting was great and well-suited, there were some morbid moments and cool visions, and the ending was something hard to forget.",4,Getting into the zone,1379635200,"09 20,

After a 5 year coma Johnny wakes up to find the world he once knew a far different place and that he himself is a now a very different person.I've seen The Dead Zone in bits and pieces many MANY times on TV, but surprisingly never sat down and watched it from beginning to end.  Well, one night I popped this baby in and realized what a dumb ass I had been.  The Dead Zone is simply an unforgettable thriller and quite possibly, almost invariable, the best film adaptation of a Stephen King novel.  Our hero in this film is the everyman, a man who lives humbly and happily.  He is a man with a lovely girlfriend and would-be wife.  A respected man.  A very normal man who cherishes his normal, banal life.  Everything is good in his little world until one rainy night when he has a run in with a big truck that puts him in a five-year coma.  When Johnny wakes he finds the world has changed.  His girlfriend is now married with child, his job is gone, and his body broken.  Oh, and the side-effect of his long slumber is to see someone's demise simply touching their flesh.  Mostly predicting death and destruction, but occasionally seeing the past.  This new ability is considered a curse at first.  As though God played a cruel trick, but after saving a little girl's life, solving a series of brutal murders, and saving a boy from drowning, Johnny considers his gift and the meretricious fame it brings a blessing.Just as Johnny begins to comie to grips with his new found abilities he meets Greg Stillson (Sheen), a candidate for senator and a very dangerous man who dreams of becoming president.  After a chance meeting with Stillson Johnny forsees a bleak future if Stillson is elected to office.  How can Johnny stop the future?The Dead Zone is of course based on the book by Stephen King and is directed by David Cronenberg who's best known for making sexually surreal thrillers.  This is definitely Cronenberg's most straight forward and best film.  Shot in the fall, covered in bleak gray skies, and snow, the atmosphere of The Dead Zone couldn't be more perfect.  The small town adds a sense of isolation that forces Smith to take digs at a new location at the half way point of the film to get his back together.  Cronenberg's usual bleakness is here, but in this film is means something is crucially needed not just for the sake of atmosphere.Christpher Walken is riveting as Smith, one of his best performances.  The tragic everyman, who didn't ask to be anything special, but when it came down to crunch time the guy wagered it all to save the many.  A truly powerful exercise in selflessness.  Brooke Adams is great as Smith's would-be wife, now torn between her feeling for him and her new love.  Great performance!  Martin Sheen is a good villain, but takes his character a bit over the top at times.  Herbert Lom is good as Johnny's friend/slash doctor as well.The Dead Zone can be looked upon as a depressing tragedy, but I don't consider it to be that way.  The finale speaks volumes about selflessness, seizing your potential and not pissing away your true gifts.  The finale while sad is more chilling and unforgettable, not a tragic fate, but a product of ultimate sacrifice.The Dead Zone is simply a brilliant film, an unforgettable journey, and one of the most fulfilling films I've seen.  A true classic and one film that deserves it's place in cinema history.

The storyline is simple.  John Smith is in a terrible traffic accident which puts him in a comatose state for five years.  When he awakens his girl has married someone else, and the world has moved on without him.  He also awakens with the power of limited second sight.  As John tries to put his life back together, the psychic ability and the notoriety it brings stand in the way, making for a fascinating story.  The film moves at a very brisk clip and continually holds the viewer's interest.  This is an emotional and somewhat haunting movie that will strike an emotional chord in most viewers.Christopher Walken's performance is superb.  He really understood the role, and this is the best performance that I have seen him in.  Tom Skerrit and Martin Sheen play supporting roles and do well.  By the way, this film has an excellent musical score that captures the mood of the story just right, and really adds to the wistful tone of the movie.In my opinion some of the Stephen King novels have not translated well to the big screen.

When he suddenly awakens, he finds that the world around him has completely changed.  The love of his life, Sarah Bracknell (Brooke Adams) has married another and he has received the dubious gift of second sight.  Johnny finds that when he touches another person, he can see their future.  Distraught and unable to bear the ramifications of his gift, Johnny retreats into himself and lives alone in a small town in the country.  He tutors children in his home to make ends meet and tries to avoid physical contact when at all possible.  However, as opportunities to use his gift come up, Johnny finds that he cannot resist.  First there is the rapist/murderer, then there is the young boys' hockey team falling through thin ice, and finally there is an obsessed politician (Martin Sheen).  In the end, Johnny must make the choice between doing what is right or continuing to endure his bleak, loveless life...Director David Cronenberg did a wonderful job adapting this Stephen King novel.  It is not a horror story like many of King's books are, but a wonderful story about a man's inner landscape.  Christopher Walken was fabulous as the self-tortured lead character and I felt that I knew exactly what he was going through, even though he never said anything.  He was also ably supported by other actors, including a conflicted Brooke Adams as his love interest and Martin Sheen as a characteture of a smarmy politician who takes kissing babies to a whole new level.

The movie version is an excellent film that actually expands on some timeless themes King introduced while trimming some of the book's less important characters and plot points.  Both book and film are basically about nice guy Johnny Smith.  At the beginning of the story Johnny is a straight laced young English teacher in love with a pretty girl and looking forward to a happy ordinary life.  A tragic accident (car crash in both movie and film but quite different details) puts him in a coma for five years and when he miraculously recovers he finds his sweet girlfriend is now married and a mother and he has been ""gifted"" with a strange psychic ability that lets him see the most traumatic scenes of people's pasts and futures.Christopher Walken is close to perfect in creating the character of Johnny.  We sympathize with him as he encounters the problems that come with recovering from years in a hospital bed and with being burdened with such a scary and important psychic ""gift"".  Early in the film Johnny, saves a girl from death by fire, identifies a serial killer, prevents a young boy from drowning and is able to tell his own doctor that the doctor's mother who was presumably killed in World War II is alive and well all thanks to his special abilities.  Late in the film he has a vision that leads him to ask others ""What would you do if you could go back in time and kill Hitler before the Holocaust and World War II happened?""  It is his answer to this question of the ability to stop evil that leads to the unforgettable climax and resolution of the plot.The movie though presumably set in Maine was filmed in Canada mostly during the winter season and the frozen landscapes perfectly match the movie's often dark mood.  The soundtrack is also noteworthy as it expertly captures the film's nightmarish qualities.  There are several bloody scenes and the serial killer material is particularly disturbing so a caution to the very squeamish.  Still this is so much better than most films of the horror genre and actually raises some interesting questions in the audience's minds.",5,Intelligent Horror Movie,1282953600,"08 28, 2010",2010,2188,"['film', 'adaptation', 'THE', 'DEAD', 'ZONE', 'quite', 'bit', 'Stephen', 'King', 'original', 'novel', 'movie', 'version', 'excellent', 'film', 'actually', 'timeless', 'themes', 'King', 'introduced', 'trimming', 'book', 'less', 'important', 'characters', 'plot', 'points', 'book', 'film', 'are', 'basically', 'nice', 'guy', 'Johnny', 'Smith', 'beginning', 'story', 'Johnny', 'straight', 'laced', 'young', 'English', 'teacher', 'love', 'pretty', 'girl', 'looking', 'forward', 'happy', 'ordinary', 'life', 'tragic', 'accident', 'car', 'crash', 'movie', 'film', 'quite', 'different', 'details', 'coma', 'five', 'years', 'when', 'miraculously', 'sweet', 'girlfriend', 'now', 'married', 'mother', 'been', 'gifted', 'strange', 'psychic', 'ability', 'see', 'most', 'traumatic', 'scenes', 'people', 'pasts', 'futures.Christopher', 'Walken', 'close', 'perfect', 'creating', 'character', 'Johnny', 'sympathize', 'problems', 'come', 'recovering', 'years', 'hospital', 'bed', 'being', 'burdened', 'scary', 'important', 'psychic', 'gift', 'Early', 'film', 'Johnny', 'girl', 'death', 'fire', 'serial', 'killer', 'young', 'boy', 'drowning', 'able', 'tell', 'own', 'doctor', 'doctor', 'mother', 'who', 'was', 'presumably', 'killed', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'alive', 'well', 'thanks', 'special', 'abilities', 'Late', 'film', 'vision', 'ask', 'others', 'What', 'would', 'do', 'could', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'kill', 'Hitler', 'Holocaust', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'happened', 'answer', 'question', 'ability', 'stop', 'evil', 'unforgettable', 'climax', 'resolution', 'plot.The', 'movie', 'presumably', 'set', 'Maine', 'was', 'filmed', 'Canada', 'mostly', 'winter', 'season', 'frozen', 'landscapes', 'perfectly', 'match', 'movie', 'often', 'dark', 'mood', 'soundtrack', 'also', 'noteworthy', 'expertly', 'film', 'nightmarish', 'qualities', 'are', 'several', 'bloody', 'scenes', 'serial', 'killer', 'material', 'particularly', 'disturbing', 'so', 'caution', 'very', 'squeamish', 'Still', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'most', 'films', 'horror', 'genre', 'actually', 'interesting', 'questions', 'audience', 'minds']",N/A

Not crystal clear but the movie is over twenty years old, so it's probably as good as it's gonna get. An acceptable transfer.AUDIO:Nice usage of the surround speakers in several scenes. I had no problems understanding any dialogue and in my opinion, a better than average sound mix. I think the music definitely benefits from this new audio remastering.EXTRAS:Cronenberg appears here in several featurettes and I always enjoy listening to whatever this man has to say about anything. He is one of the most engaging speakers I have ever had the pleasure of listening to and he hides nothing really, providing interesting insight into the film and how he approached adapting King's book. Several other members of the crew are present and pop up to chime in on their memories of shooting the film. Most notably absent is Walken himself and I would have loved to hear his recollections on playing Johnny Smith.OVERALL:This is a very nice reissue of the Dead Zone which for the price it's going for, is a steal.

He survives the accident but enters a coma and awakens to find himself several years in the future. His entire life has changed seemingly overnight. However, not only that, but Johnny now posesses a psychic gift that allows him to see possible events in the future and events that have occurred in the past. The ""gift"" seems like a curse and separates Johnny from the rest of the world. The movie builds up to the point when Johnny meets a man running for the US Senate.  He sees the evil in the man and the destruction of the world if he is elected. So the question is raised, if you could go back in time and kill Hitler, would you?THE DEAD ZONE stays fairly close to the King novel it is based upon. There really isn't any horror here, just a tasty morsel of the supernatural.  Walken, who so often finds trouble finding good work because of his peculiar physical appearance and voice, fits the part of Johnny Smith perfectly. Also memorable is Tom Skerrit in the role of a local sheriff and Martin Sheen as the shady politician. The movie is worth watching and serves as a good introduction to some of the non-horror writings of Stephen King.",4,"Not a Horror Movie, But a Suspenseful Drama.",1040860800,"12 26, 2002",2002,1749,"['Stephen', 'King', 'really', 'good', 'writer', 'even', 'become', 'known', 'king', 'horror', 'However', 'best', 'Stephen', 'King', 'stories', 'are', 'one', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'horror', 'stories', 'such', 'Rita', 'Hayworth', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'THE', 'GREEN', 'MILE', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'are', 'same', 'stories', 'when', 'adapted', 'have', 'been', 'turned', 'best', 'movies', 'DEAD', 'ZONE', 'one', 'films.THE', 'DEAD', 'ZONE', 'teacher', 'named', 'Johnny', 'Smith', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'mysterious', 'night', 'carnival', 'Johnny', 'car', 'accident', 'dropping', 'off', 'girlfriend', 'accident', 'coma', 'awakens', 'find', 'several', 'years', 'future', 'entire', 'life', 'changed', 'seemingly', 'overnight', 'However', 'not', 'only', 'Johnny', 'now', 'psychic', 'gift', 'see', 'possible', 'events', 'future', 'events', 'have', 'occurred', 'past', 'gift', 'curse', 'separates', 'Johnny', 'rest', 'world', 'movie', 'point', 'when', 'Johnny', 'man', 'running', 'US', 'Senate', 'evil', 'man', 'destruction', 'world', 'elected', 'question', 'raised', 'could', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'kill', 'Hitler', 'would', 'DEAD', 'ZONE', 'fairly', 'close', 'King', 'novel', 'based', 'really', ""n't"", 'horror', 'here', 'just', 'tasty', 'morsel', 'supernatural', 'Walken', 'who', 'so', 'often', 'trouble', 'finding', 'good', 'work', 'peculiar', 'physical', 'appearance', 'voice', 'part', 'Johnny', 'Smith', 'perfectly', 'Also', 'memorable', 'Tom', 'Skerrit', 'role', 'local', 'sheriff', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'shady', 'politician', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'serves', 'good', 'introduction', 'non-horror', 'writings', 'Stephen', 'King']",N/A

Many years after seeing ""The Dead Zone,"" my impressions of it still linger. This alone distinguishes it from the hundreds of other movies I've seen.My most vivid recollection is of Christopher Walken as Johnny Smith. Other reviewers have called Walken weird and creepy, but I remember his Johnny Smith as a sensitive and likeable mentor -- the kind of man I would want as a teacher and friend. Walken's portrayal of Smith's warmth and caring was inspirational, and Cronenberg uses this portrayal to convey the idea that goodness and nobility are themselves the aberrations, while pettiness, neglect, and indifference are all too often the norms. Hence, Walken's good guy is the outsider who chooses to battle evil.I say that this film reverberates today because it has parallels in current events. When trying to unmask evil, it is often the good guy who is villified.[spoiler alert -- don't read further if you want to be surprised by the movie's ending]In ""The Dead Zone,"" Johnny Smith attempts to assassinate the evil Martin Sheen character (a senator running for president). The senator, to protect himself from Smith snatches a child from the audience to use as a shield, revealing his true nature (i.e., evildoers are by nature cowards). In the movie, the incident is captured on film and plays prominently in headlines that ostensibly destroy the senator's political aspirations.But this is only a movie. Here in reality, we find parallels in the ""Pet Goat"" incident, where the president was informed -- while attending a classroom photo op -- that the country was under attack. Instead of excusing himself to take command, he reflexively froze and continued the photo op for 20 plus more minutes, not knowing whether there was a missile or aircraft targeted at him (and the classroom full of kids). All this happened while video cameras recorded every agonizing minute.The incident sparked my recollection of ""The Dead Zone,"" making me appreciate it even more. It's a piece of art that obviously encapsulates timeless revelations about human nature. For that, I consider ""The Dead Zone"" a memorable experience.",5,Still Reverberates Today,1093046400,"08 21, 2004",2004,2265,"['did', ""n't"", 'read', 'Stephen', 'King', 'story', 'can', 'only', 'comment', 'film', 'Maybe', 'advantage', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'preconceptions', 'Many', 'years', 'seeing', 'Dead', 'Zone', 'impressions', 'still', 'linger', 'alone', 'hundreds', 'other', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen.My', 'most', 'vivid', 'recollection', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Johnny', 'Smith', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'called', 'Walken', 'weird', 'creepy', 'remember', 'Johnny', 'Smith', 'sensitive', 'likeable', 'mentor', 'kind', 'man', 'would', 'want', 'teacher', 'friend', 'Walken', 'portrayal', 'Smith', 'warmth', 'caring', 'was', 'inspirational', 'Cronenberg', 'portrayal', 'convey', 'idea', 'goodness', 'nobility', 'are', 'aberrations', 'pettiness', 'neglect', 'indifference', 'are', 'too', 'often', 'norms', 'Hence', 'Walken', 'good', 'guy', 'outsider', 'who', 'battle', 'evil.I', 'say', 'film', 'today', 'parallels', 'current', 'events', 'When', 'trying', 'unmask', 'evil', 'often', 'good', 'guy', 'who', 'villified', '[', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'do', ""n't"", 'read', 'further', 'want', 'be', 'surprised', 'movie', 'ending', ']', 'Dead', 'Zone', 'Johnny', 'Smith', 'attempts', 'assassinate', 'evil', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'character', 'senator', 'running', 'president', 'senator', 'protect', 'Smith', 'child', 'audience', 'use', 'shield', 'revealing', 'true', 'nature', 'i.e.', 'evildoers', 'are', 'nature', 'cowards', 'movie', 'incident', 'captured', 'film', 'plays', 'prominently', 'headlines', 'ostensibly', 'senator', 'political', 'aspirations.But', 'only', 'movie', 'Here', 'reality', 'find', 'parallels', 'Pet', 'Goat', 'incident', 'where', 'president', 'was', 'informed', 'attending', 'classroom', 'photo', 'op', 'country', 'was', 'attack', 'Instead', 'excusing', 'take', 'command', 'reflexively', 'froze', 'continued', 'photo', 'op', '20', 'more', 'minutes', 'not', 'knowing', 'was', 'missile', 'aircraft', 'targeted', 'classroom', 'full', 'kids', 'happened', 'video', 'cameras', 'recorded', 'agonizing', 'minute.The', 'incident', 'sparked', 'recollection', 'Dead', 'Zone', 'making', 'appreciate', 'even', 'more', 'piece', 'art', 'obviously', 'timeless', 'revelations', 'human', 'nature', 'consider', 'Dead', 'Zone', 'memorable', 'experience']",N/A
212977,AQP1VPK16SVWM,6300214443,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[7, 7]","First the important stuff out of the way. If you've seen this movie you know what it's about and already have probably owned it on DVD. So what's different here? Well the transfer is a marked improvement with a sharp looking anamorphic higher definition transfer of the film. It'll look extremely good on 16x9 widescreen TV's and even on more conventional (although not quite with as much a difference)TV's. The previous edition of the film was practically bare bones. This edition lacks a commentary from David Cronenberg (which is a pity as he's always entertaining in his commentary tracks) but comes with four terrific featurettes. The first ""Memories from The Dead Zone"" features new interviews with Cronenberg, King expert Douglas Winter, film editor Ronald Sanders and actress Brooke Adams. discussing how they got involved in the film and when they realized what a terrific film they were truly making. ""The Look of The Dead Zone"" focuses on the cinematographer by Mark Irwin and features an interview with him. ""Visions and Horror From The Dead Zone"" again has many participants from the original production and ""The Politics of The Dead Zone"" also features a vintage interview with Sheen discussing the film. Unfortunately Christopher Walken is curiously MIA but everyone else does make up for the actor's absence with insightful comments on the film and why it continues to resonate. I don't think the TV series would have taken off as well as it did if Cronenberg and Boam hadn't made such a terrific movie in the first place.The film looks good and while there are some mild digital artifacts that occasionally mar the picture the film hasn't ever looked this good on home video. Definitely worth the upgrade for that by itself.What follows are two paragraphs about the making of the film and the plot but if you've seen it you probably know this stuff and can skip the rest.After doing ""Videodrome"" David Cronenberg was looking for a film where he didn't have to write the project. He was exhausted from the involvement of that cult classic. When he met the late Debra Hill (via their mutual friend and Hill's long time collaborator John Carpenter) the late Jeffrey Boam (""Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade"", co-creator/writer/producer of ""The Adventures of Brisco County Jr."") had penned a terrific script that perfectly captured the feeling of King's book (Cronenberg comments in one of the extras that the best way to ""remain faithful to the book is to betray it...because you're dealing with two completely different mediums"" and one can see his point).The late Michael Kamen's wonderful score sounds terrific here (I would have loved an isolated score to appreciate the music that much more but perhaps in the next incarnation of the film). The cold, icy look of the film is nicely realized in this sharp looking transfer. The film does show its age but looks quite good overall.Highly recommended.**Spoilers ahead**Johnny Smith (Walken) seems to have it all--he loves teaching the kids at his school and is engaged to be married to another teacher (Adams). The future dims for Smith when he's in a horrible car accident and a subsequent coma for 5 years. The world has moved on but Johnny hasn't. When he awakens from his coma he finds he has the ability of ""second sight"", i.e., he can see the possible future and past just by touching people or items they've handled. The police pull him into an investigation of a serial killer and he gains a bit of fame from it but that second sight shows him a potential disaster-- Greg Stillson (Martin Sheen in a terrific polar opposite performance to his later one as the President in ""The West Wing""). Stillson isn't just dangerous but evil. Smith sees that Stillson will initiate a nuclear holocaust. Johnny knows he's the only one that can stop him.",5,"Cronenberg's top notch film of King's novel gets even better with deluxe DVD, extras",1160265600,"10 8, 2006",2006,3815,"['First', 'important', 'stuff', 'way', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'know', 'what', 'already', 'have', 'probably', 'owned', 'DVD', 'So', 'what', 'different', 'here', 'Well', 'transfer', 'marked', 'improvement', 'sharp', 'looking', 'anamorphic', 'higher', 'definition', 'transfer', 'film', ""'ll"", 'look', 'extremely', 'good', '16x9', 'widescreen', 'TV', 'even', 'more', 'conventional', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'much', 'difference', 'TV', 'previous', 'edition', 'film', 'was', 'practically', 'bare', 'bones', 'edition', 'commentary', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'pity', 'always', 'entertaining', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'four', 'terrific', 'featurettes', 'first', 'Memories', 'Dead', 'Zone', 'new', 'interviews', 'Cronenberg', 'King', 'expert', 'Douglas', 'Winter', 'film', 'editor', 'Ronald', 'Sanders', 'actress', 'Brooke', 'Adams', 'discussing', 'how', 'got', 'involved', 'film', 'when', 'realized', 'what', 'terrific', 'film', 'were', 'truly', 'making', 'Look', 'Dead', 'Zone', 'cinematographer', 'Mark', 'Irwin', 'interview', 'Visions', 'Horror', 'Dead', 'Zone', 'again', 'many', 'participants', 'original', 'production', 'Politics', 'Dead', 'Zone', 'also', 'vintage', 'interview', 'Sheen', 'discussing', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'curiously', 'MIA', 'everyone', 'else', 'make', 'up', 'actor', 'absence', 'insightful', 'comments', 'film', 'why', 'resonate', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'TV', 'series', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'off', 'as', 'well', 'did', 'Cronenberg', 'Boam', 'had', ""n't"", 'made', 'terrific', 'movie', 'first', 'place.The', 'film', 'good', 'are', 'mild', 'digital', 'artifacts', 'occasionally', 'mar', 'picture', 'film', ""n't"", 'ever', 'looked', 'good', 'home', 'video', 'Definitely', 'upgrade', 'are', 'two', 'paragraphs', 'making', 'film', 'plot', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'probably', 'know', 'stuff', 'can', 'skip', 'rest.After', 'doing', 'Videodrome', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'was', 'looking', 'film', 'where', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'write', 'project', 'was', 'exhausted', 'involvement', 'cult', 'classic', 'When', 'met', 'late', 'Debra', 'Hill', 'mutual', 'friend', 'Hill', 'long', 'time', 'collaborator', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'late', 'Jeffrey', 'Boam', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'Last', 'Crusade', 'co-creator/writer/producer', 'Adventures', 'Brisco', 'County', 'Jr.', 'had', 'penned', 'terrific', 'script', 'perfectly', 'captured', 'feeling', 'King', 'book', 'Cronenberg', 'comments', 'one', 'extras', 'best', 'way', 'remain', 'faithful', 'book', 'betray', ""'re"", 'dealing', 'two', 'completely', 'different', 'mediums', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'point', '.The', 'late', 'Michael', 'Kamen', 'wonderful', 'score', 'sounds', 'terrific', 'here', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'isolated', 'score', 'appreciate', 'music', 'much', 'more', 'perhaps', 'next', 'incarnation', 'film', 'cold', 'icy', 'look', 'film', 'nicely', 'realized', 'sharp', 'looking', 'transfer', 'film', 'show', 'age', 'quite', 'good', 'overall.Highly', 'recommended', '**Spoilers', 'ahead**Johnny', 'Smith', 'Walken', 'have', 'teaching', 'kids', 'school', 'engaged', 'be', 'married', 'teacher', 'Adams', 'future', 'Smith', 'when', 'horrible', 'car', 'accident', 'subsequent', 'coma', '5', 'years', 'world', 'moved', 'Johnny', ""n't"", 'When', 'coma', 'ability', 'second', 'sight', 'i.e.', 'can', 'see', 'possible', 'future', 'past', 'just', 'touching', 'people', 'items', ""'ve"", 'handled', 'police', 'pull', 'investigation', 'serial', 'killer', 'gains', 'bit', 'fame', 'second', 'sight', 'potential', 'disaster', 'Greg', 'Stillson', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'terrific', 'polar', 'opposite', 'performance', 'later', 'one', 'President', 'West', 'Wing', 'Stillson', ""n't"", 'just', 'dangerous', 'evil', 'Smith', 'Stillson', 'will', 'initiate', 'nuclear', 'holocaust', 'Johnny', 'only', 'one', 'can', 'stop']",N/A

It's probably because psychic abilities stories are not the least bit appealing to me. This was sitting in my Amazon queue, about to disappear in a few days, so I watched it and experienced the primary reason why I watch movies.This is tight and suspenseful and very well-acted (except for one character which I'll touch on shortly). The opening scene that establishes the relationship between Johnny (Walken) and Sarah (Brooke Adams) is pedestrian but purposeful and Johnny's awakening from a coma is tastefully played out. But Johnny's first psychic event is stunning and kind of snaps you awake with him.I really admire the way this movie establishes Johnny's powers and how events slowly reveal to him his &#34;dead zone&#34;. There are several stories within a story here, and I kept thinking about where this movie was going. With the introduction of a crooked politician named Greg Stillson (played by Martin Sheen), the movie's destination slowly comes into view. And speaking of Martin Sheen...even though his character is pivotal to the fate of Johnny and the scale by which this story climbs with Stillson's own ascension, I can't stand the way Sheen plays this. Sheen is bombastic, slimy and generally a cliched version of Hollywood's take on politicians. I'm not defending politicians here, but I am disappointed in the portrayal within this otherwise excellent film.Even though Sheen's Stillson is over-the-top and practically cartoonish, he can't extinguish the amazing final act. It's a very satisfying conclusion and worth noting again that this movie hurtles Johnny from saving lives in a small town to saving...well, let's just say something larger.Cronenberg avoids all of his typical weird body-horror here, and instead offers up a taut thriller that you should watch as soon as possible.",4,"Opinion on movie only, not the Blu-Ray or packaging",1373587200,"07 12, 2013",2013,1918,"['fan', 'Stephen', 'King', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'fact', 'movie', 'eluded', 'now', 'surprising', 'probably', 'psychic', 'abilities', 'stories', 'are', 'not', 'least', 'bit', 'appealing', 'was', 'sitting', 'Amazon', 'queue', 'disappear', 'few', 'days', 'watched', 'experienced', 'primary', 'reason', 'why', 'watch', 'movies.This', 'tight', 'suspenseful', 'very', 'well-acted', 'one', 'character', ""'ll"", 'touch', 'shortly', 'opening', 'scene', 'relationship', 'Johnny', 'Walken', 'Sarah', 'Brooke', 'Adams', 'pedestrian', 'purposeful', 'Johnny', 'awakening', 'coma', 'tastefully', 'played', 'out', 'Johnny', 'first', 'psychic', 'event', 'stunning', 'kind', 'snaps', 'awake', 'him.I', 'really', 'admire', 'way', 'movie', 'Johnny', 'powers', 'how', 'events', 'slowly', 'reveal', '34', 'dead', 'zone', '34', 'are', 'several', 'stories', 'story', 'here', 'kept', 'thinking', 'about', 'where', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'introduction', 'crooked', 'politician', 'named', 'Greg', 'Stillson', 'played', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'movie', 'destination', 'slowly', 'view', 'speaking', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'even', 'character', 'pivotal', 'fate', 'Johnny', 'scale', 'story', 'Stillson', 'own', 'ascension', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'way', 'Sheen', 'Sheen', 'bombastic', 'slimy', 'generally', 'cliched', 'version', 'Hollywood', 'take', 'politicians', ""'m"", 'not', 'defending', 'politicians', 'here', 'am', 'disappointed', 'portrayal', 'otherwise', 'excellent', 'film.Even', 'Sheen', 'Stillson', 'over-the-top', 'practically', 'cartoonish', 'ca', ""n't"", 'extinguish', 'amazing', 'final', 'act', 'very', 'satisfying', 'conclusion', 'worth', 'noting', 'again', 'movie', 'Johnny', 'saving', 'lives', 'small', 'town', 'saving', 'well', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'something', 'larger.Cronenberg', 'typical', 'weird', 'body-horror', 'here', 'instead', 'up', 'taut', 'thriller', 'should', 'watch', 'as', 'soon', 'possible']",N/A
