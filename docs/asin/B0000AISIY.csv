763556,A1PID2MT8MMPAF,B0000AISIY,"A. Griffiths ""Adrian""","[9, 10]","Look Around You Series One:This spoof comedy series is so firmly entrenched in its origins - a very small pocket of British television history known as Programmes for Schools, which were TV shows intended to be videotaped and shown in classrooms for educational purposes - that it might be almost impossible for it to be appreciated by anyone outside of the UK, and even for us residents, it's full genius can only be appreciated by those of us around and at school in the 1970's, or awake at night watching those hideous Open University programmes.But luckily I was one of those people, and I I found ""Look Around You"" to be hysterical. The dry-as-dust delivery of the presenters and the totally bonkers ideas for educational experiments and scientific reports that populate each segment have to be seen to be believed. Each short segment passes itself off as a serious investigation into some scientific theme or other, and experiments or reports are carried out on screen to supposedly teach the viewer about various scientific facts. Of course, the facts and figures quoted or discovered during the show are all totally and hilariously fictitious, such as discussing what the highest number in the world might be, or setting a maths problem about ladies buying shoes for spiders, Sample experiments vary from the laugh-out-loud crazy to the very subtley skewed, and they include a study of ants building a miniature igloo, opening up a garden pea to extract its brain (yes it has one!), and programming a computer to compose a pop song about a mouse.The interior studio scenes are all filmed in a clinical and stark lab setting with lots of close-ups, while the outside reports use faux grainy (or sometimes genuine recycled) 1970's stock footage. In a way, obvious ploys like getting you to laugh at bad haircuts and ugly fashions are almost overkill, but they still add extra appeal, and something to look at while you think carefully about whether ""mafipulation"" is a real word, or try and recall just what on earth some of the elements appearing on that Periodic Table being displayed actually were.The narration, sets, graphics and film clips are all spot-on 1970's pastiches and the series quickly developed a cult following, albeit a small one as there are only 8 episodes and they last a tiny 10 minutes long each. Nevertheless, it did lead to a second series, which to my mind is more successful, as it spoofs another British 1970's TV show about science called ""Tomorrows World"", and the episodes were extended to half an hour for that format.A great investment for anyone with a love for archaic British television. Anyone that ""gets"" it will find themselves in the fortunate position of laughing solidly throughout the whole series.",4,Comedy Curiosity,1146614400,"05 3, 2006",2006,2748,"['Look', 'Series', 'One', 'spoof', 'comedy', 'series', 'so', 'firmly', 'entrenched', 'origins', 'very', 'small', 'pocket', 'British', 'television', 'history', 'known', 'Programmes', 'Schools', 'were', 'TV', 'shows', 'intended', 'be', 'videotaped', 'shown', 'classrooms', 'educational', 'purposes', 'might', 'be', 'almost', 'impossible', 'be', 'appreciated', 'anyone', 'UK', 'even', 'residents', 'full', 'genius', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'appreciated', 'school', '1970', 'awake', 'night', 'watching', 'hideous', 'Open', 'University', 'programmes.But', 'luckily', 'was', 'one', 'people', 'found', 'Look', 'be', 'hysterical', 'dry-as-dust', 'delivery', 'presenters', 'totally', 'bonkers', 'ideas', 'educational', 'experiments', 'scientific', 'reports', 'populate', 'segment', 'have', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed', 'short', 'segment', 'off', 'serious', 'investigation', 'scientific', 'theme', 'other', 'experiments', 'reports', 'are', 'carried', 'screen', 'supposedly', 'teach', 'viewer', 'various', 'scientific', 'facts', 'course', 'facts', 'figures', 'quoted', 'discovered', 'show', 'are', 'totally', 'hilariously', 'fictitious', 'such', 'discussing', 'what', 'highest', 'number', 'world', 'might', 'be', 'setting', 'maths', 'problem', 'ladies', 'buying', 'shoes', 'spiders', 'Sample', 'experiments', 'vary', 'laugh-out-loud', 'crazy', 'very', 'subtley', 'skewed', 'include', 'study', 'ants', 'building', 'miniature', 'igloo', 'opening', 'up', 'garden', 'pea', 'extract', 'brain', 'yes', 'one', 'programming', 'computer', 'compose', 'pop', 'song', 'mouse.The', 'interior', 'studio', 'scenes', 'are', 'filmed', 'clinical', 'stark', 'lab', 'setting', 'lots', 'close-ups', 'outside', 'reports', 'use', 'faux', 'grainy', 'sometimes', 'genuine', 'recycled', '1970', 'stock', 'footage', 'way', 'obvious', 'ploys', 'getting', 'laugh', 'bad', 'haircuts', 'ugly', 'fashions', 'are', 'almost', 'overkill', 'still', 'add', 'extra', 'appeal', 'something', 'look', 'think', 'carefully', 'mafipulation', 'real', 'word', 'try', 'recall', 'just', 'what', 'earth', 'elements', 'appearing', 'Periodic', 'Table', 'being', 'displayed', 'actually', 'were.The', 'narration', 'sets', 'graphics', 'film', 'clips', 'are', 'spot-on', '1970', 'pastiches', 'series', 'quickly', 'developed', 'cult', 'following', 'small', 'one', 'are', 'only', '8', 'episodes', 'last', 'tiny', '10', 'minutes', 'long', 'Nevertheless', 'did', 'lead', 'second', 'series', 'mind', 'more', 'successful', 'British', '1970', 'TV', 'show', 'science', 'called', 'Tomorrows', 'World', 'episodes', 'were', 'extended', 'hour', 'great', 'investment', 'anyone', 'love', 'archaic', 'British', 'television', 'Anyone', 'will', 'find', 'fortunate', 'position', 'laughing', 'solidly', 'whole', 'series']",N/A

763559,A1RD1LL5E5JZOT,B0000AISIY,"Crookedmouth "":-/""","[3, 4]","Look Around You is a spoof of a genre of television programming that those of a certain age will remember well, namely the BBC's educational programmes for schools during the 70's and 80's that we were often plonked in front of when the teacher was off sick or it was raining too hard to be let out for play.The format is simple - each week's ""module"" takes a particular subject (Calcium, Maths, Water, Germs, Ghosts, Sulphur, Music, Iron and Brain) and explores it in the manner of a pre O Level science or maths educational programme, by way of a series of experiments. Much of the humour derives from the nostalgia evoked by the subject matter which is enhanced by the slightly grainy, washed-out appearance of the film stock and by the way that various props and themes hark back to the ""good old days"".The real laughs, though, come from the sheer silliness of it all. We learn in the first module that Maths stands for Mathematical Anti-Telharsic Harfatum Septomin and that the largest number in the world is about 45,000,000,000 (although mathematicians suspect that there may be even larger numbers). Later, we learn that Ghosts can't whistle but that the Gloriette 5000 - a complex arrangement of diodes, marbles and valves - enables us to make visual contact with the dead and that they can be very helpful in performing lab experiments. More humour is derived from the naming (fastidiously done with DymoTape) of mythical items of lab equipment (the Besselheim Plate, the Lady Jane Grey tube, the mafipulator and so-on) and the way in which the lab technician is careful to indicate each item as described with his pencil. It's really worth while watching this very carefully as much satisfaction can be derived from the little details that pass you by on the first viewing (the labelling of the chemical jars in the opening credits, for instance, or the lab technician's hand injuries during the egg boiling experiment).It may sound a little childish (and it is, of course) but it is done with such po-faced panache and exquisite timing that it is pulled off to perfection. Indeed, such is the quality of the observational humour that it is actually quite difficult to remember that you are watching a spoof and I am convinced to this day that I did in fact watch one of the episodes as an 8 year old, back in 1974 in Mrs McIver's science class.That said, it should be clear to you that the humour may well go way over your head if you haven't experienced this sort of programme as a child so this is probably not for everyone.The DVD comes with some extras; a set of spoof Teletext pages that are well worth sitting through and a music video that would probably give My Lovely Horse a run for its money. I'd also recommend that you buy the second series - a different beast altogether but done in much the same vein.""The brain is basically a wrinkled bag of skin, filled with warm water, veins and thought muscles. Think of it as a kind of modified heart, only with a mind or brain. The opposite of the brain is probably the bum. It's nowhere near as intelligent as the brain. It doesn't have to be as it only needs to make very basic calculations.""",5,Thanks Amazon.
