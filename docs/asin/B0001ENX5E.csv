Anyway season six really hits a home run for me. The writing, acting, and growth of each character is at its finest. Only twelve episodes but they are brilliant, heartwarming, and of course hilarious. Some of the standout episodes: To Market To Market, Pick-a-Little, Talk-a-Little, The Post-it Always Sticks Twice, and One.

But to complain about the price is unnecessary. Not only was the season split in half by several months - essentially having a 12 episode 6th season and an 8-episode 7th season, but many full-season DVD sets of popular television shows - such as Showtime's Queer as Folk or Xena - are priced at upwards of $100 per season. And it's safe to say that, while QAF and Xena are fun shows, SATC is far superior, and worth the fifty bucks. Stop whining - if you're a fan of the show and want to cherish it for years, take the $50 out of your paycheck and buy the DVDs!

The writers do a marvelous job weaving magic into the lives of these tremendous characters. The archs of each of the women believeably and comically make this show something so special. I am a New Yorker, and nothing looks as good in real life as it does on the show, and yet it feels so real. I just gotta get every season, (although I agree that the corporate jerks are totally manipulating fans by breaking the season into two over-priced segments. The extra dough probably won't make it to S.J. Parker, Kim Catrall or any of the other actresses, or even the crew that ""make"" the show. If you've seen the HBO building, you gotta wonder about the overhead. I'm thinking Sex and Sopranos pay for many a paycheck.) Anyway, I laughed my butt off during this season! I've always enjoyed the previous seasons and I watch them to lift my spirits from time to time. But, this season was the best so far! The supporting cast kicked major booty too! I'm totally against giving away details for the few of you out there who ""don't watch television"", like me. Suffice it to say, this show keeps getting better. I'm thrilled to own each season released thus far. I got into Sex through word of mouth and I am just doing my small part to pass on the word.

Sure, I know it's for profit...but hey!  The more we spend on DVD, the less we have to spend on Shoes.There are several standouts in this section of the final season however.  First is the episode where Carry meets her high school flame, juxtaposed with Miranda realizing her crush on Dr. Leeds.  It is one of the most cleverly staged episodes, and the stories mingle nicely.  And the scene with Miransa and Charlotte at the Basketball Game, cooing over Dr. Leeds who is also talking to a cheerleader is remarkable in it's ability to transport any woman back to those giddy high school days.Charlottes' jewish conversion is also one of the better threads in this season, and is played masterfully by Kristen Davis.  She has a surprising amount of depth, when you consider that this is really the most fully developed season for the character of Charlotte.  It makes you wonder what great things could have been accomplished had they developed Charlotte so fully early on.However, the standout of the season is Samatha and her health.  I won't put a spoiler in here to reveal her ailment for those who haven't seen it, but it's a true testatement to talent of the writers and actors how they can portray one's battle with disease as humourously, painfully, and courageously as the S$TC group did.  Catrall should expect another emmy, but with the gangbusters her two supporting actress co-stars gave this year will make it anybody's game!The only problem is this ISN'T THE FULL SEASON!

Ultimately, I believe their social lives actually enhance their careers.  Too many people get so career-focused that they actually implode.  No matter what happens on the job, these women seem to say, they ""have a life.""Season Six shows the four ""girls"" growing up. Samantha is well into her forties with the soul of a twenty-something.  We see her playful side: when she sneaks into an exclusive club to get access to a swimming pool and when she goes wild over a younger man -- and maybe falls in love!Charlotte's religious conversion is handled tastefully and respectfully, and we see a lighter side of Charlotte with her delightful new husband, Harry.  IMiranda too shows increased complexity as she falls in love with a new neighbor but recognizes where her heart really belongs.And, like many reviewers, I loved Carrie's lost shoe story. I love the way she didn't back down when she asked for money -- and found a graceful way to get what she wanted.  What I picked up was not so much the lifestyle resentment (""how could she spend $485 on one pair of shoes?"") but the obligations of single people to buy gifts to honor their married friends' special occasions.But you can't miss Carrie's mistake with Big. Either she needs to back off or she needs to read between the lines. He doesn't wear his heart on his sleeve.  He's older and more sophisticated -- in fact, at times I'm surprised he's still eligible.  But he obviously cares for Carrie and their chemistry creates visible sparks.The DVD set lets us hear voiceovers and my complaint isn't about price: I wanted more director's commentary! I realize a busy producer has other things to do -- but his insights add considerably to a high-quality show.  This set includes a presentation at a museum seminar, where each actor talks about her character.  Not very deep but fun to see the actors out of role.

My friends and I are eagerly awaiting the release of Part II later on this month.As I have said, there are only twelve of the twenty episodes from Season 6 (due to that fact that Season 5 was so short). Some of the best episods from the whole show come from this season, in which Charlotte converts to Judaism to marry Harry, Samantha reaches some kind of intimacy with Smith, Carrie dates Berger (who later breaks up with her via Post-It note), and Miranda, who juggles having a baby with her career wile still being in love with Steve. The episodes:1) To Market to Market2) Great Sexpectations3) The perfect present4) Pick a little, Talk a little5) Lights, Camera, Relationship6) Hop, Skip and a Week7) The post-it always sticks twice8) The catch9) A woman's right to shoes10) Boy, interrupted11) The Domino effect12) OneEnjoy!",5,Season six is the best of them all,1103328000,"12 18, 2004",2004,1007,"['got', 'hooked', 'show', 'watching', 'few', 'episodes', 'TBS', 'then', ""'ve"", 'rented', 'first', 'five', 'seasons', 'first', 'twelve', 'episodes', 'Season', '6', 'ones', 'DVD', 'friends', 'are', 'eagerly', 'awaiting', 'release', 'Part', 'II', 'later', 'month.As', 'have', 'said', 'are', 'only', 'twelve', 'twenty', 'Season', '6', 'due', 'fact', 'Season', '5', 'was', 'so', 'short', 'best', 'episods', 'whole', 'show', 'come', 'season', 'Charlotte', 'converts', 'Judaism', 'marry', 'Harry', 'Samantha', 'kind', 'intimacy', 'Smith', 'Carrie', 'Berger', 'who', 'later', 'up', 'Post-It', 'note', 'Miranda', 'who', 'having', 'baby', 'career', 'wile', 'still', 'being', 'love', 'Steve', 'episodes:1', 'Market', 'Market2', 'Great', 'Sexpectations3', 'perfect', 'present4', 'Pick', 'little', 'Talk', 'little5', 'Lights', 'Camera', 'Relationship6', 'Hop', 'Skip', 'Week7', 'post-it', 'always', 'sticks', 'twice8', 'catch9', 'A', 'woman', 'right', 'shoes10', 'Boy', 'interrupted11', 'Domino', 'effect12', 'OneEnjoy']",N/A

I would pay the full price of this DVD set just to get the last scene when Berger breaks up with Carrie on a post-it, and in a rage she knocks over the vase.  What an amazing scene...so powerful.2) The episode where Charlotte attends the Jewish singles dating function, where she tearfully confesses her love to Harry.  I was blown over.  Charlotte has become one of the most developed characters in the show.  She was, at first, nothing more than a stereotype -- beautiful girl, looking for romance and love and money.  But this actress (thanks to the writers giving her a chance) has blossomed into such an amazing character, especially when, in a depression over losing her child, she sees the documentary on Elizabeth Taylor and she shows up tall, proud and beautiful to Miranda's party.3) Samantha's growing relationship with Jarod.  Although I loathed his semi-fake character at first, I have grown to love his character, especially at the pinnacle of this relationship when Samantha ditches Jarod and has sex with Richard.  Seeing her face during that scene, and her ""breakdown"" when she arrives at the bottom floor to find him waiting for her, was priceless and sweet.  Again...very powerful.The only part of this season I despised was the relationship with Mikhail.  What an awful awful awful forced ugly relationship.  Carrie became someone who I didn't even recognize.  When she kissed him (or was subjected to his overzealous face-sucking, depending on how you viewed it) on the street after he retrieved her purse from the cab, my friends and I retched in revulsion at so contrived a plot.  And although it ended just as I wanted it to, I could not but point at the TV and scream, ""Death!"" every time his character came on the screen.I highly suggest you buy this set.  It's powerful and it has some of the best acting of the series.

This first part with 12 episodes contains the comedy of season 3 and the maturity of season 4. It also shows how the caracters are finding their ways in life. Carrie starts dating a writer. The relationship seems serious in the beginning but then it has a twist and then on the last episode Carrie meets someone very special.Charlotte falls in love with her divorce lawyer and becomes jewish while she tries to get married with him. Miranda's nights become strange when she spends every night watching a series where a white woman falls in love with a black guy who lives in her same building and that actually becomes a reality in her own life, but again there's a big twist on the last episode of this part of the season. Finally Samantha gets where she or any viewer would have ever thought. She dates and has sex with just one guy during the 12 episodes. This guy was a waiter in one restaurant and Samantha wanted to have on-night-stand with him which she has but then she meets with him again in a party and then she finds him special and she helps him very much when she makes him become a star. (That doesn't mean that there are not funny scenes, yes there are several funny scenes).If you have seen the seasons before this one, this one is a must have to continue with the story.

802668,A3STFA7AA4G36G,B0001ENX5E,"Kevin Fink ""finkles2000""","[24, 30]","Look, I know that people are upset that this is only the first 12 episodes of the 6th and final season.  I don't know exactly why HBO did this - perhaps they could release these episodes faster than the entire season.  Perhaps the 2nd part will have more extras (doubtful, yes, but plausible).  And yes, you still have to pay full price - but it's worth it.I had never seen any of these episodes until I broke down and purchased this set.  Since then, this season has become my favorite.  Let's just break down the characters:Miranda - I never really liked Miranda that much.  Although she obviously cared for Steve, she was never fully able to let him in.  She always applied business tactics to her love life - be blunt, be honest, and don't let your feelings get in your way.  In this season, she's a softer, kinder Miranda.  She states that she might be one of those people who were never meant to be truly happy.  And she realizes her true feelings for Steve and finally lets him know!  Cynthia Nixon has said that when she first started the series, she really didn't understand or connect with Miranda.  Now that her character has grown a little bit, Ms. Nixon has said she totally identifies with her.  In this season (part 1), Miranda falls in love with her new boyfriend (TiVo), dates a hunky doctor for the Knicks, and comes to terms with her feelings for Steve.  Oh, and Brady turns 1!Charlotte - It's a pity that Kristen Davis has never been nominated for an Emmy or Golden Globe.  She brings so much to her character.  If she's not nominated this year, then something is definitely wrong.  This is Charlotte's season.  Her fling with Harry turned into true love.  We see her through many, many obstacles, and she deals with them in true Charlotte fashion.  She realizes that she already had the perfect wedding, but she still wants her 2nd one to go just as smoothly.  Unfortunately, it doesn't - but as Carrie reminds her, her seemingly perfect life with Trey was anything but.  Charlotte is hilarious on her wedding day.  But this season shows real heartbreak for Charlotte, and Ms. Davis acts with true brilliance.  This season (part 1), Charlotte converts to Judaism, gets married, gets pregnant, and miscarries.  This is definitely Charlotte's season.Samantha - In the Museum of TV and Radio interview on the last disc, Kim Cattrall states that she didn't think Samantha changed over the course of the series - the viewers only see emerging layers of her.  I couldn't agree more.  In the beginning, Samantha was there to shock, amaze, and titillate us with her explicit scenes - nothing more.  In the 4th, 5th, and 6th seasons, Samantha still does this, but we see more of her (emotionally - I think we've seen all of her physically).  Samantha's still Samantha - she loves life, men, and sex.  In this season, Samantha has a fling with a waiter/actor, she turns him into a superstar, finds a grey hair (down there), and deals with the prospect of (the horror!) Public Displays of Affection.  In the next part, she deals with her greatest challenge ever - breast cancer.And finally, Carrie - First of all, I want to say that even though Kim Cattrall and Sarah Jessica Parker didn't really get along, they show such chemistry on screen.  It's such a testament to the great acting ability of both women that they were able to set aside differences for the sake of the show.  That said, this season Carrie shows a lot of growth.  Remember in the first two seasons when Carrie practically had a different boyfriend in every episode?  Those days are long gone.  Carrie wants more.  She wants love, respect, and Manolo Blahniks.  In one great episode (""A Woman's Right to Shoes""), Carrie gets fed up of having to buy wedding shower presents, wedding presents, honeymoon presents, and baby shower presents.  Single people get nothing, Carrie realizes, and this comes to a head when her shoes go missing at a friend's apartment and the friend chastises her for not having a life and spending money on shoes.  She's a grown up in her relationship with Berger.  This is Carrie's first relationship in which I've thought, ""Carrie did nothing wrong.  If anything, she was supportive and willing to work everything out.""  Throughout the first part of season 6, Carrie gets broken up via post-it, deals with Big's bombshell of heart surgery, has a bad fling with a best man, and meets a Russian artist (who I cannot stand, FYI).""Sex and the City"" broke the mold.  Never has a show been so open and honest in dealing with sex and relationships.  It's never been afraid to show how funny, dramatic, fantastic, devastating, and romantic sex can be.  The writing has never been smarter and the characters have never been more fully fleshed-out.That said, when watching the shows back to back, it becomes slightly annoying.  The puns, which were so geniusly spoofed on Saturday Night Live, can get a little tedious.  And the fact that every situation that a character gets into reflects Carrie's column that week is a tad overwhelming at times.  But not enough that you shouldn't watch.My favorite moment of the entire series happens in ""Boy, Interrupted.""  Stanford is reeling from his break-up with Marcus (Stanford found that Marcus had once been an escort), and takes Carrie as his date to a GLBT ""prom.""  As Carrie and Stanford dance to Chicago's ""If You Leave Me Now,"" Marcus breaks in and declares his love for Stanford.  As Stanford forgives Marcus, he puts his head on his shoulder, and the two men dance to the song together.  Carrie sways to the music by herself. . . and she's never looked more confident or fabulous.Forget all the hoopla surrounding HBO and monetary issues.

I also liked that the writers brought Berger back, and I liked the romance he and Carrie had, as for Charlotte, she was always my least favorite character, probably because ive been around women like her my whole life, started with Mom..it was good she landed a rich lawyer, and her conversion to the faith was funny, so her..yes she over looked Harry's hidieousness, but if he had not been rich and successful, she would never have given him the time of day..thats our Char..I always liked when the writers brought back Stanford and Anthony, they were both very funny..as for my favorite character Miranda, I loved that she and Steve where happy, she is the most authentic character and by far the best actress on the show, just go back and watch the episode when her mom dies..it was heartbreaking.

If you are a fan of the show, then you see how the characters have grown in the 6 years the show has been on.  Charlotte finally coming to terms with life not always being perfect, but that does not prevent her from trying to make it so.  You also see her willing to convert to Judaism to marry Harry.  A man you don't expect her to be with, but she let personality overshadow looks.  Charlotte is determined to have a child and you are with her while she is dealing with that.  That scene is the most heart wrenching.  You see Miranda struggle with dating, her career and motherhood.  Miranda also has a love affair with TIVO, and you wonder can she finally say I Love you?  Samantha is still Samantha, but now she is dealing with a much younger man, and grey hairs in odd places.  Carrie is dealing with dating, new boyfriends, ex-boyfriends, and boyfriends with thick accents.  When a pair of Carries shoes are taken while she attends a baby shower, her throwing a shower for herself and registering her shoes, was just BRILLIANT!!!I mean why should Carrie be made to feel bad about how much she  spends on shoes?  If she wants to spend over $400 for shoes, let her spend that much for shoes!!!  She has no children, and I felt that woman was responsible for the shoes, or tried harder to find out who stole Carries Milano shoes!!! I mean what kind of person steals someone's shoes?Blair Underwood, all I can say is that man is so handsome and I was riveted to the screen every time he made his appearance as Dr. Leeds.
