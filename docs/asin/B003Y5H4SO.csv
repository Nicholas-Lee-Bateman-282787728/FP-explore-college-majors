Well, unfortunately the fact the storyline felt extremely rushed turned out to be its biggest downfall.  It needed about 30 more minutes to build into something truly terrifying, but unfortunately the movie writers apparently thought the storyline was good enough the way it is.The best part about Devil is easily whenever the lights shut out inside the elevator, this means the devil is about to make an appearance.  At first the cops (who are watching the trapped people from a separate room, thanks to a camera positioned on the elevator ceiling) believe there's a killer among the group, but sadly such a simple explanation is not the case.I really liked the acting by just about everybody, and all the trapped people seemed to be especially on the money as far as delivering a believable character performance.  I firmly believe however, that devoting more time to expanding the storyline would have bumped my rating from a 3 to a 4, because it's honestly an okay film.  There's definitely a few good twists along the way (not *great* twists by any means) and the final 10 minutes was a complete shocker to me.By the way, why did everyone in the elevator immediately have a bad attitude?

One man is black, which almost certainly exempts him for PC reasons.  Another man is a showy salesman, which would make for an ideal modern-day villain--which is also too obvious.  Another is a blue-collar type who creates bad vibes with the black guy, thus making him a perfect anti-hero for liberal Hollywood.  But wouldn't this be a dead giveaway?  Then there's the femme fatale who has a history of blackmailing rich men.  Oh, devilish indeed--and too easy.  So that leaves the senior female.  A security camera did catch her lifting a wallet, but maybe her Social Security doesn't suffice, poor old thing.  Traditionally, she would definitely be the least likely candidate.  But, in contemporary terms, isn't she an evil symbol of all that's holding back the cultural revolution and all that?Modern movie themes are often hampered by the implications inherent in all these characters, and, in horror film, such strictures necessarily dampen the potential for suspense and surprise.  As it is, contemporary flicks about the paranormal struggle with the presentation of religion-based good and evil.  Christianity has for decades become more and more a taboo-fraught subject, so that any modern cinema that deals with the Devil seldom demonstrates even a moderate grasp of dogma and popular tenets concerning this being.  In this film, for example, beliefs about Satan are presented in a folk-religious context, as peasant mythology and primitive superstition.  The only prayer uttered is in Spanish--without subtitles.  The words of the entreaty apparently are of no import in this plot, in any language.  They are to be construed as mumbo-jumbo and nothing more.  The Devil--the ultimate and powerful enemy of all mankind--could just as well have been a malevolent goblin.  (The title even fails to credit the entity as THE Devil, leaving to interpretation the possibility of a demon or even a bad person.)  Instead of enlisting the powers of the priesthood against the forces of hellfire, the cops call in the fire department.  Instead of getting the Devil out of the building, they strive only to get the surviving humans out of the elevator.For a well-acted, decently-directed effort, this movie could have been so much better had its premise embraced the idea of an all-encompassing, supernatural evil.

I won't quite compare an elevator ride to flying or taking the subway but it is a form of transportation and you have little control until the big box that encapsulates you decides to open and releases you.  Luckily, 99.9% of the time it does.Basically, we have a skyscraper office building and three men and two women ""randomly"" board the ill fated elevator. On the 30th floor or so they realize they are stuck as the elevator jolts and ceases to move.  Immediately building security that monitors the elevators is aware that they have a stuck elevator and puts a man on the job of getting them unstuck.  What should be an easy procedure becomes challange after challange as attempts to rescue them are thrwarted by seemingly normal mishaps.A big problem is that building security can see them and speak to them but the trapped passengers cannot be heard.  A detective who is a couple months sober happens to be in the vicinity, investigating a suicide jumper from the skyscraper building where the stuck elevator is.  The detective is brought into the building because as the lights flicker on and off, one of the five is dead so the other four quickly become suspicious of each other.  There was very little character development but that's okay. The storyline that the devil is supposed to be in the elevator and could be any one of them is almost incidental; for me it was all about being in a trapped elevator with no apparent way out.

1371385,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B003Y5H4SO,Chris Pandolfi,"[2, 4]","""Devil"" is the best film M. Night Shyamalan didn't direct. I think I now understand why I haven't liked any of his movies - he lets himself get in the way of his own good ideas (exempting ""The Last Airbender,"" which wasn't his idea at all). By giving the filmmaking responsibilities to others, his ideas can remain intact, but at the same time, they can also be approached from a different, less self-constraining angle. They might even be improved. For ""Devil,"" Shyamalan is credited as the story creator and as one of the producers. The screenwriter is Brian Nelson, recently known for penning the vampire thriller ""30 Days of Night"" and the indie shocker ""Hard Candy,"" the latter of which scared the living hell out of me. The director is John Erick Dowdle, who underwhelmed me with ""Quarantine"" and is still intriguing me with his as yet unreleased film ""The Poughkeepsie Tapes,"" delayed since 2007.While by no means a great supernatural thriller (as so few are), ""Devil"" is surprisingly effective - taut, suspenseful, and brisk, with decent performances and intriguing dialogue to boot. On the one hand, it's a claustrophobic horror story about things that happen in the dark, and if there's anything we've learned from the good horror movies, it's that your mind can conceive of things far scarier than what a director reveals on camera. On the other hand, it's a chilling character study, a peek into the souls of people. Many of them are bad. Others have simply made mistakes and lurking underneath is the capacity for change, which covers everything from facing your demons to forgiving those who have wronged you. It all boils down to a simple decision: You either pay for your sins, or you ignore them. You can probably guess which of the choices is easier. You also probably know that what's easy isn't necessarily what's right.The film is founded on the premise of a Devil's Meeting, in which Satan takes on human form and tests evildoers by tormenting them. And so it comes to pass in a Philadelphia high rise that five people enter an elevator, only for the car to stop mysteriously stop in mid ascent; what begins as an inconvenience quickly gives way to suspicion, paranoia, and the occasional loss of light, at which point awful sounds are heard. When the lights come back on ... well, I don't think I should say what we see, for it would ruin the apprehension. Let's just say that on board are a mattress salesman (Geoffrey Arend), a temp security guard (Bokeem Woodbine), a young woman (Bojana Novakovic), an old woman (Jenny O'Hara), and an ex-soldier turned mechanic (Logan Marshall-Green). In one way or another, all have done things that have hurt other people. And as the ads have repeatedly told us, one of them isn't who he or she seems.They all have clashing personality quirks. The salesman is insensitive and never knows when to keep his mouth shut. The guard is uncomfortable in tight spaces. The young woman overreacts. The old woman worries about everything. The mechanic has a short fuse and is always guarded, which is a good indicator of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Who amongst them seems a likely candidate for the Antichrist? Take your pick - they're all equally capable of bad deeds.Keeping tabs on them via surveillance camera is Detective Bowden (Chris Messina), who was drawn into the situation when investigating an apparent suicide at the same site. Bowden is a recovering alcoholic and still trying to cope with a recent tragedy. He doesn't believe in anything greater than himself, and he certainly doesn't believe in the Devil; it's a matter of reasoning, of processing the information as he finds it. At his side is the film's narrator, a security guard named Ramirez (Jacob Vargos). He's devoutly religious. He completely believes in the Devil, who he's convinced is responsible for the terror unfolding in the elevator. How else to explain the distorted face that appears in a single frame of the elevator's surveillance footage? How else to explain the warning signs his mother dictated to him as a child? How else to explain why every attempt to fix the cable system or penetrate the shaft walls have all failed?If Bowden is a man of no faith, and if he's in a situation that has no logical explanation, one must deduce that he's eventually forced to believe in something higher than himself. I should emphasize that I'm not necessarily referring to God. Saying that you believe in something higher than yourself could mean any number of things, and of that, I will say no more. Regardless, Bowden is being tested, just as the people in the elevator are. I leave it to you to discover who passes and who fails. ""Devil"" is certainly not groundbreaking, but it's a perfectly competent horror film - technically sound, nicely performed, frightening, and above all, engaging. In my review of ""The Last Airbender,"" I admitted that my nature was to resist the films of M. Night Shyamalan; on the basis of this film, I think he would be wise to let other directors interpret his work from now on.

Night should stay on the production side of the house (while opening more doors for others to direct his stories) since this is the best movie he's done in a long time, maybe even as far back as ""The Sixth Sense"".Alfred Hitchcock and Rod Serling would be proud of this film, which combines simplicity with a twist, and was enough to keep me interested in how the plot would climax throughout the rather short 80-minute duration.  It reminded me of some of the old ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" and ""Twighlight Zone"" episodes; which, by the way were short in length but long on quality.The cast was full of underrated familiar faces, including Bokeem Woodbine, Chris Messina, Jenny O'Hara and Jacob Vargas, who did an admirable job delivering lines from Brian Nelson's screenplay.  John Erick Dowdle did a nice job of guiding the scenes and characters from behind the camera and I throught his style of direction was well suited for this subtle mystery slash thriller.Bottom line: Night Chronicles Productions stepped up to the plate and hit a home run with M.

1371388,A3U7ELIED4WP4R,B003Y5H4SO,Dark Faerie Tales,"[3, 5]","The Review:Clocking in at only 80 minutes, the M. Knight Shyamalan produced Devil is a fast moving supernatural horror/suspense film, and one of the better film's baring Mr. Shyamalan's name in quite many years.  Five strangers, a mechanic, a guard, an old woman, a young woman and a salesman, are stuck in an elevator in a high rise office tower in Philadelphia.  Besides having to endure truly awful elevator music, there are intermittent power cuts that leave them all standing absolute darkness.  Oh, yeah, when the lights go out something or someone attacks them.  Their only link to the world outside is the elevator security camera and the people on the other side of that camera, including Philadelphia police detective Bowden.  The people trapped in the elevator can hear their observers, but their observers can only see, but not hear, them.  Each time the lights go out, the attacks get more and more violent.  It starts out as a loud noise and then someone gets cut.  From that point on every flicker of the elevator lights induces panic.  It's a great setup, and Devil's abbreviated length keeps this premise fresh where a longer film might have caused it to overstay its welcome.Any discussion of the plot of Devil treads dangerously close to spoiler territory as most of Devil's enjoyment stems from its who-done-it plot elements.  Discovering how these people come to be stuck in the elevator, how they are all connected and figuring out whom or what is attacking them in the dark encompasses most of the Devil experience.  Imagine if prior to seeing the Sixth Sense, The Usual Suspects or Se7en, someone told you how they ended or what the major plot reveal is, or worse if someone told you what the matrix was before you saw the Matrix?  Now Devil's big reveal or ending probably doesn't rate up there with The Usual Suspects', especially with a more sophisticated movie audience used to shock endings, or unexpected plot twists, but it did manage to keep me guessing until the end.  Based on that alone, I recommend seeing Devil.Strong performances by an ensemble cast, without any big name actors added to the film.  For a bit of the film, there's a sense that it could be any of us stuck in the elevator being terrorized by an unknown force.  As the story goes on though, you may be able to dissociate yourself because one of the plot elements is that ***SPOILER ALERT*** everyone in the elevator is a bad person, or a ""sinner"" for lack of a better term.  Who they are and what they did is part of why they find themselves tormented in an elevator dangling 20 stories. ***END SPOILER***In the end Devil succeeds in taking a simple premise, being stuck in an elevator with 4 strangers, and turns it into a great horror movie.  It feeds on the common fear of tight spaces and augments that fear by adding an element of terror that only comes when the lights go out, playing on our fears of the dark.  Devil is a solid horror film that should keep you guessing until the end.

1371391,A397O3RI6RY531,B003Y5H4SO,"Dashing Diva ""~Me~""","[0, 1]","To the people who liked this movie and are now calling it a M. Knight Shamalamadingdong come back...stop.  He didn't direct it, and that's an insult to John Erick and Drew Dowdle, who actually did direct it.  M. Knight get's billing for the ""story"" and he produced it.  If you're not sure what the difference is between a director and producer?  Google is your best friend.  On to the review...Devil is the story of a ""Devil's Meeting"" that takes place in a highrise in the city.  The ""Devil's Meeting"" is an old wive's tale that starts with a suicide and ends with the devil coming in human form to claim souls of wicked/evil people.  The entire plot and set up of the movie are done with a voice over in the beginning and then a quick introduction to the ""good guys"" and a brief, omonious flash of the people soon to be trapped in the elevator.===SOME MIGHT CONSIDER THIS PART A SPOILER==Five people, 2 women and 3 men, all who have shady past (the devil only comes for evil people afterall) are trapped in an elevator.  All seem suspicious, rude or crude in some way, and we are led to believe that ONE of these people is the devil in the flesh.  We get to watch as the passengers in the elevator all become suspicious of each other as odd things start to happen when the lights go out.  Outside the elevator the cops, fire dept and security guards rush around the building trying to figure out why people keep dying inside the elevator and which passenger would have motive to kill these supposed strangers they're trapped with.===================================================Surprisingly, I was entertained.  I went in with VERY low expectations because M. Knight was associated with the movie and I'd just watched his latest failure, Avatar: The Last Airbender, so that may be why I enjoyed it as much as I did.  I wasn't bored, I wasn't disappointed when the ending came.  So that in my book was worth the $ to rent it.  The plot isn't complicated and yes, even though it seemed obvious who the devil in diguise was (in fact my 57yr old mom called it within the first 10mins after the characters were trapped in the elevator), it still held my attention.  The mythology was weak, afterall it's only an old wive's tale.  The acting was pretty good, it was fast paced so it didn't really call for anything grandiose.  The fear and tension portrayed by the different characters was believeable enough, and the end gave a nice little wink to M. Knight with a TWIST.  Albeit the TWIST was somewhat obvious if you were looking for one.All in all, it was enjoyable.  I wouldn't necessarily classify this as a HORROR movie though. Maybe a supernatural suspense thriller?  While there are some scenes with blood and death they're SUPER tame compared to movies like Saw and Hostel.  And even the monster (in this case the devil) wasn't scary at all.  I was more drawn into the story and the creepiness of being trapped in a small space with strangers and being picked off, one by one.  While not terrifying...it was enough to keep my attention.  And as a capper there did seem to be an actual MESSAGE to the movie.  It wasn't just a scary movie for the sake of being a scary movie (albeit it wasn't all that scary) - it was more like a slightly more bloody and flashy Aesop's Fable.Solid 4 out of 5 stars since I was entertained and am willing to watch it again.",4,I was entertained...,1297209600,"02 9, 2011",2011,3362,"['people', 'who', 'liked', 'movie', 'are', 'now', 'calling', 'M.', 'Knight', 'Shamalamadingdong', 'come', 'back', 'stop', 'did', ""n't"", 'direct', 'insult', 'John', 'Erick', 'Drew', 'Dowdle', 'who', 'actually', 'did', 'direct', 'M.', 'Knight', 'get', 'billing', 'story', 'produced', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'difference', 'director', 'producer', 'Google', 'best', 'friend', 'review', 'Devil', 'story', 'Devil', 'Meeting', 'place', 'highrise', 'city', 'Devil', 'Meeting', 'old', 'wive', 'tale', 'suicide', 'devil', 'coming', 'human', 'form', 'claim', 'souls', 'wicked/evil', 'people', 'entire', 'plot', 'set', 'up', 'movie', 'are', 'done', 'voice', 'beginning', 'then', 'quick', 'introduction', 'good', 'guys', 'brief', 'omonious', 'flash', 'people', 'soon', 'be', 'trapped', 'elevator.===SOME', 'MIGHT', 'CONSIDER', 'THIS', 'A', 'SPOILER==Five', 'people', '2', 'women', '3', 'men', 'who', 'have', 'shady', 'past', 'devil', 'only', 'evil', 'people', 'afterall', 'are', 'trapped', 'elevator', 'seem', 'suspicious', 'rude', 'crude', 'way', 'are', 'led', 'believe', 'ONE', 'people', 'devil', 'flesh', 'get', 'watch', 'passengers', 'elevator', 'become', 'suspicious', 'other', 'odd', 'things', 'start', 'happen', 'when', 'lights', 'go', 'out', 'elevator', 'cops', 'fire', 'dept', 'security', 'guards', 'rush', 'building', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'people', 'keep', 'dying', 'elevator', 'passenger', 'would', 'have', 'motive', 'kill', 'supposed', 'strangers', ""'re"", 'trapped', 'with.===================================================Surprisingly', 'was', 'entertained', 'went', 'VERY', 'low', 'expectations', 'M.', 'Knight', 'was', 'associated', 'movie', ""'d"", 'just', 'watched', 'latest', 'failure', 'Avatar', 'Last', 'Airbender', 'may', 'be', 'why', 'enjoyed', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'was', ""n't"", 'bored', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'when', 'ending', 'came', 'book', 'was', 'worth', 'rent', 'plot', ""n't"", 'complicated', 'yes', 'even', 'seemed', 'obvious', 'who', 'devil', 'diguise', 'was', 'fact', '57yr', 'old', 'mom', 'called', 'first', '10mins', 'characters', 'were', 'trapped', 'elevator', 'still', 'held', 'attention', 'mythology', 'was', 'weak', 'afterall', 'only', 'old', 'wive', 'tale', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'was', 'fast', 'paced', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'call', 'anything', 'grandiose', 'fear', 'tension', 'portrayed', 'different', 'characters', 'was', 'believeable', 'enough', 'end', 'gave', 'nice', 'little', 'wink', 'M.', 'Knight', 'TWIST', 'TWIST', 'was', 'somewhat', 'obvious', 'were', 'looking', 'one.All', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'would', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'classify', 'HORROR', 'movie', 'Maybe', 'supernatural', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'are', 'scenes', 'blood', 'death', ""'re"", 'SUPER', 'tame', 'compared', 'movies', 'Saw', 'Hostel', 'even', 'monster', 'case', 'devil', 'was', ""n't"", 'scary', 'was', 'more', 'drawn', 'story', 'creepiness', 'being', 'trapped', 'small', 'space', 'strangers', 'being', 'picked', 'off', 'one', 'one', 'not', 'terrifying', 'was', 'enough', 'keep', 'attention', 'capper', 'there', 'did', 'seem', 'be', 'actual', 'MESSAGE', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'scary', 'movie', 'sake', 'being', 'scary', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'scary', 'was', 'more', 'slightly', 'more', 'bloody', 'flashy', 'Aesop', 'Fable.Solid', '4', '5', 'stars', 'was', 'entertained', 'am', 'willing', 'watch', 'again']",N/A

Instead of blood, lights occasionally go off in the elevator, followed by lots of loud screaming and thumping and then someone would end up injured from the devil.  M.

To me, if a film can create goose-bumping terror that stimulates the qsyche instead of graphic visuals, it has achieved true horror status; after all, it's our own minds where fear is manifested and compounded--cerebral over physical.  And when a person is terrified, and is in mortal peril and danger, it's the imagination that feeds this terror until all rational thought is exhausted and reptilian survival instincts take over.  Such is the case when five strangers are trapped in an elevator with an unseen (mostly) demonic force, while two security guards and a couple of police detectives are helpless bystanders watching terror conquer via a security camera.  It's a fantastic device, and works amazingly well in DEVIL; not to mention the story, acting, visuals, and pacing are all orchestrated to facilitate terror to the max in this very finely crafted movie.I knew next to nothing about the cast in DEVIL, yet they all deliver exceptional roles, from Chris Messina as a detective plagued by a tragic past, to Logan Marshall-Green as one of the victims with a dark past of his own, to Bojana Novakovic as a frightened young woman with some dysfunctional skeletons in her closet, too.  And only one word can be used to describe Jenny O'Hara's performance:  disturbing.  No, DEVIL does not have relentless, gratuitous violence and gore, nor disfigured, killing-machine monsters; what it does have is cerebral terror that begins early and escalates to powerful dimensions that mesmerize.

I liked ""Unbreakable"" and ""Signs,"" and I'm one of the rare ones who saw some brilliance in the spotty delivery of ""The Village."" I tried to stick with him with his next films, but after the insult of ""The Happening,"" I'd had my fill. When I heard that ""Devil"" was directed by someone else, while based on a Night idea, I figured I'd give it a chance. My expectations were as low as an elevator can go.The movie starts with a made-for-TV, CSI-type death. It's something that could be resolved in an hour, with bathroom breaks, but ""Devil"" only uses this as the catalyst for a South American myth of the devil finding strength in a suicide and using it as an excuse to play havoc with a few other sinful souls. The voice-over that explains all this is done by a security guard in a Philadelphia skyscraper. Soon he is a witness, through security cameras, of the devil's meeting that occurs in one of the building's trapped elevators. Five people are on board. All have secrets. All become progressively freaked out as the violence escalates. One is the devil in disguise.The film starts with a verse from the New Testament, about the devil seeking those he may devour, and it ends with another biblical sentiment. In between, it focuses on the panic and mental anguish caused by individuals' sins, and although there is some B-movie violence, it is more psychological than anything. The man trying to get to the bottom of the whole mess is a Philadelphia detective who has some demons of his own from the untimely death of his wife and son in a collision with a drunk driver five years earlier.In the end the movie has its ups and downs, its spiritual clarity and obscurity, and a few moments of grace and forgiveness. In some ways its simplicity is what made it more satisfying for me.

Night Shyamalan was on board here as a producer and also came up with this I believe so I was interested to say the least. I heard many things about this movie, some good some bad so I had to check it out. After watching this I have to say I liked more than I thought but it wasn't what I expected. I was actually expecting something a little more, scary I guess. But still for a pg 13 film it was good.A man has committed suicide by way of jumping out of a window of a building; of course the police are called in. while there it seems there is a problem in the same building, an elevator is stuck with a group of people stuck on it. The thing is something wrong is going on, like people getting killed inside the elevator. As the police and security look on from a security camera they try to figure it out and stop what it going on. The thing is an evil presence may be inside that building and it just may be the devil, here to punish the wicked.The idea behind this film is great and really had me hyped about this movie; I always seem to like these types of flicks. I must say that the atmosphere here is nice but this movie reminds me of the Twilight Zone, Tales from the Darkside, Tales from the Crypt and stuff like that. With that said it feels as short as one of those episodes, really it feels really short. The acting at least is good especially those in the elevator, pretty much every one here does a good job.This film is far from the best ever and that is a little disappointing, it had the potential to be a classic. Still this is not as bad as some think and is worth a rental at least, it has some good special features so that is always a plus.

The plot twist at the end was the big Kahuna, and in this movie, it was there, but I'm sure there were plenty of people who had it all figured from the opening scene. I didn't because I don't try to look that far ahead. I'd rather have the story carry me there. In this case, I was at first surprised, but not shocked after I thought about it. I don't know if that's a bad thing, but it was nothing like the surprises of his earlier work. Maybe because there is expected to be a plot twist, no matter what he does, it is no longer a surprise.The movie has a decent if unknown cast and takes place in Night's hometown of Philadelphia. I'm guessing the building used doesn't really exist, but either way, the structure looked good.For anyone with a phobia about being trapped in an elevator, this takes things to the next level with the uninvited guest. During the whole movie, I tried to figure out which character is the real bad guy. From every one of the elevator passengers to the cop to the Hispanic security guard (who I think was narrating the story), they were all suspect. There were plenty of red herrings thrown in to keep things interesting and when we finally find out who the real bad guy is, I was at least a bit surprised, though my wife wasn't. The other twist was with the cop but I don't want to spoil that for anyone else, despite what others may have said in their reviews.The film didn't get too excessively bloody or gory, and most of that was implied more than shown graphically. In this case, it worked just fine.I do not regret spending the money on this rental.

Max Gooding,"[3, 4]","This movie is narrated from the stand point of Ramirez (Jacob Vargas), a gentleman with a spanish accent, this lends itself nicely to folklore and the old wives' fable that is about to be told. He is a security guard, that works in the building that is in question. He has been told this story, about to unfold by his mother, however, the settings and events would have been somewhat different. But, the general pattern is the same.As an initiation, there is usually a suicide that takes place at the scene as the devil enters the location. The concept is that the devil, at times will manifest himself as a human to torment certain evil souls before they are killed and taken off to Hell.In this particular scenario, an elevator is the chosen venue to torment the unfortunate souls. Five persons, 2 women and 3 men enter the elevator, one is the devil, but no-one except the devil knows this. The contenders are as follows:[1] An ex-soldier that has a spotty criminal record. He  has a stash of tools hidden in the Men's Room and did not bother to sign in with security at the front desk.[2] An Old Lady that has stolen the receptionist's purse. She arms herself with pepper spray.[3] A Young Lady that is on her way to meet her lawyer to clean out her husband financially, who owns the security firm that has the responsibity for the building's security.[4] A temporary Security Guard that is on his second day on the job. He also has a criminal record, and is known for violence.[5] A Salesman that has gotten a considerable amount of wealth through a Ponzi Scheme. One of his victims has committed suicide.Bodies start to drop in the elevator as the movie progresses. However, each time the lights in the elevator go out just at about that time, so the damage is done under the cover of darkness. It is a ""Who Done it"" in close quarters and fingers point wildly, as fears and emotions rise.Although this film is centered around the elevator, there is still enough shots in and around the building to keep the interest and variety going.The film is very suspenseful, and most of the actual violence is hidden with only the aftermath being made visible. This is a descent movie in terms of its production quality, and it will keep the viewer interested right down to the ending, which is as usual quite surprising and with a twist.",4,Confession is good for the Soul,1297728000,"02 15, 2011",2011,2333,"['movie', 'narrated', 'stand', 'point', 'Ramirez', 'Jacob', 'Vargas', 'gentleman', 'spanish', 'accent', 'nicely', 'folklore', 'old', 'wives', 'fable', 'be', 'told', 'security', 'guard', 'building', 'question', 'been', 'told', 'story', 'unfold', 'mother', 'however', 'settings', 'events', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'somewhat', 'different', 'general', 'pattern', 'same.As', 'initiation', 'usually', 'suicide', 'place', 'scene', 'devil', 'location', 'concept', 'devil', 'times', 'will', 'manifest', 'human', 'torment', 'certain', 'evil', 'souls', 'are', 'killed', 'taken', 'off', 'Hell.In', 'particular', 'scenario', 'elevator', 'chosen', 'venue', 'torment', 'unfortunate', 'souls', 'Five', 'persons', '2', 'women', '3', 'men', 'enter', 'elevator', 'one', 'devil', 'no-one', 'devil', 'contenders', 'are', '[', '1', 'ex-soldier', 'spotty', 'criminal', 'record', 'stash', 'tools', 'hidden', 'Men', 'Room', 'did', 'not', 'bother', 'sign', 'security', 'front', 'desk', '2', ']', 'Old', 'Lady', 'stolen', 'receptionist', 'purse', 'pepper', 'spray', '3', ']', 'A', 'Young', 'Lady', 'way', 'meet', 'lawyer', 'clean', 'out', 'husband', 'financially', 'who', 'security', 'firm', 'responsibity', 'building', 'security', '4', ']', 'temporary', 'Security', 'Guard', 'second', 'day', 'job', 'also', 'criminal', 'record', 'known', 'violence', '5', ']', 'A', 'Salesman', 'gotten', 'considerable', 'amount', 'wealth', 'Ponzi', 'Scheme', 'One', 'victims', 'committed', 'suicide.Bodies', 'start', 'drop', 'elevator', 'movie', 'However', 'time', 'lights', 'elevator', 'go', 'out', 'just', 'time', 'damage', 'done', 'cover', 'darkness', 'Who', 'Done', 'close', 'quarters', 'fingers', 'point', 'wildly', 'fears', 'emotions', 'film', 'centered', 'elevator', 'still', 'enough', 'shots', 'building', 'keep', 'interest', 'variety', 'going.The', 'film', 'very', 'suspenseful', 'most', 'actual', 'violence', 'hidden', 'only', 'aftermath', 'being', 'made', 'visible', 'descent', 'movie', 'terms', 'production', 'quality', 'will', 'keep', 'viewer', 'interested', 'right', 'down', 'ending', 'usual', 'quite', 'surprising', 'twist']",N/A

Night Shyamalan seems to have hit his stride in his first film, The Sixth Sense, and despite the fact that he elects to continue exploring the dark side of thought, his recent products have a lot of promise but seem to falter in the endings.  DEVIL is like that.  One wants to suggest that this is his take on Sartre's 'No Exit' but after the film gets rolling it simply falls into the category of another stuck elevator story where the people inhabiting the chamber reveal all the good and bad aspects of human behavior while providing a platform for a little 'the devil made me do it'  chatter.The film starts well enough with gorgeous upside down vistas of the city of Philadelphia. A body lies on the street in front of a glass skyscraper and the police are called - Detective Bowden (Chris Messina) has reported to figure out what is happening - a suicide or murderous fall.  Attention turns inside where five people enter an elevator: a Mechanic (Logan Marshall-Green), a mattress salesman (Geoffrey Arend), a security guard (Bokeem Woodbine), a fussy older lady (Jenny O'Hara), and a young woman (Bojana Novakovic). The elevator abruptly stops between floors and the claustrophobia of the situation begins to wear on the nerves of the five people.  They are watched on video camera and a one way speaker  by two other security guards - Lustig (Matt Craven) and Ramirez (Jacob Vargas).  Strange things begin to happen and one by one the people trapped in the elevator are murdered. Ramirez swears this is the work of the Devil and gradually his fears seem to be true.  The actual identity of the Devil comes as a surprise as does the ending of the film - the lone survivor being connected by history to Detective Bowden's tragedy in the past.The story does well in the category of suspense, and it is populated by a very able cast of actors, but it is the superimposition of moralizing and the need to make the Devil a person that pulls the plug on the intensity of the story.  It has it's moments but in the end it leans a bit toward the silly side.

1371413,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B003Y5H4SO,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[3, 5]","In South America there is a myth known as the Devil's Meeting. It suggests that the Devil walks among us always, and that an act of suicide gives him license to come in and play his games. For Old Scratch delights in trapping his victims in confined spaces and there tormenting them, before taking them to Hell. M. Night Shyamalan, whose name is mud, produces this one, doesn't direct it. I don't know if that impacts your decision to see or avoid this film. I saw DEVIL and thought it didn't suck. I give it a marginal thumbs up. But it's no SIXTH SENSE. Sadly, those heady days seem to be firmly in Shyamalan's rear view mirror. I hope he proves me and you wrong somewhere down the line. Anyway, DEVIL opens with a suicide, a jumper off a highrise building. The tone is promisingly ominous.DEVIL is a supernatural locked room conundrum, except that ""supernatural"" being the operative word, the murder mystery isn't about to play fair with the audience. Still, when five strangers get trapped in an elevator, it's fun to right away start guessing which one of these poor souls is actually the Devil. Because that's the premise of this horror movie.When the Devil's around, everything goes wrong. To demonstrate this, the superstitious security guard (serving as the story's chorus) tosses up a jelly jam sandwich and it lands jelly down, thus ridiculously proving his point. I guess someone was required to establish the film's mythology. The guard also informs the investigating police detective (Chris Messina), as they view the stuck elevator's security camera, that the Devil is allowing them to see what they're seeing for a reason. For the police detective - coping with his own personal tragedy - the connection is easy enough to figure out.I liked this movie, didn't love it. The premise of people stranded in the elevator with the Devil is really intriguing, and I enjoyed how that was presented, liked how the Devil, identity unknown, sowed his seeds of doubt and mistrust. But I feel that more could've been done with the premise. For one thing, the trapped characters aren't developed enough and so there's no real incentive to care whether they survive or not. Also, whatever claustrophobic feel the elevator scenes produced was undermined by other scenes which featured the characters not stuck in the elevator. LIFEBOAT did the claustrophobic movie best - heck, CUBE is another fine example - and partly because there were no outside influences. The cameras focused solely on the cornered characters. Another good one is the Twilight Zone episode ""Five Characters in Search of an Exit.""The story isn't as suspenseful or creepy or scary as I'd hoped. The violence happens off camera, whenever the elevator lights would go out. When the lights came back on, there lay (or hung) the gristly results. Maybe most damningly, when the Devil finally makes his presence known, it's more disappointing than anything. Not at all frightening. So 3 out of 5 stars for the atmospheric ambiance and the premise and the execution of it, but I crave more than what a defanged horror film has to offer. I won't even go into how the film early on sets up sparks between the detective and that hot girl (I think she was an EMT) only to absentmindedly drop that thread.The DVD's bonus material: 3 Deleted Scenes which respectively introduce the salesman, the old woman, and the mechanic, three of the five elevator passengers (totaling 00:03:58 minutes); ""The Story"" - a featurette laying out the movie's premise (00:02:33); ""The Devil's Meeting"" - Ysamur Flores, PhD Folklore and Mythology, and the filmmakers offer some musings on the Devil (00:02:28); and M.

To put it mildly, if your name appears in a film's trailer and people groan, you know things are bad.  However, there is hope for Mr. Shyamalan, as he proves with, ""Devil"" that he still has some great stories in him.""Devil"" is a supernatural horror/thriller/fable that follows five strangers who, on an ordinary day, enter a skyscraper, and get onto an elevator.  Shortly after, the elevator mysteriously stops, and they become trapped.  While the building's security crews (and a local detective) work to get them out, it soon becomes clear that things are not what they seem, and that one of the people in the elevator is none other then the devil, disguised in human form.""Devil"", despite not being directed by Mr. Shyamalan (he came up with the story and produced it), echoes his previous works by having a slow (but steady) pace, a heavy supernatural presence, and themes of ordinary people dealing with said supernatural presence.  And true to his previous films, there's a very low reliance upon visual effects, as most of the film is shot practically, instead relying on tension, story, and characters to catch our attention, rather then flat out gore and violence (though there is a good amount of that as well).Ultimately, ""Devil"" succeeds in its reliance on storytelling and characters.  The people in the film are interesting, and act believably, considering the circumstances they find themselves.  Watching them starting to get at each others throats doesn't feel forced at all, and as you learn more about the people in the elevator, you get even more interested in them.  But in my mind, what truly sets ""Devil"" apart from other similar horror films is the final fifteen minutes.  While I can't go into any details without spoiling anything, I will say that as I watched the film, I really had no idea how it could end, and when the climax and ending come around, I thought it was refreshingly different and satisfying from similar horror films.Overall, for a low budget horror film, ""Devil"" is really good B movie (even with the infamous, ""TURN ON THE LIIIGGGGHHHHTSSSS!"" quote).  I left the theater feeling very satisfied, and would definitely recommend it to fans of the supernatural/horror genre.

Face-plant after face-plant he went down, floor by floor, and finally persevered, picking himself up off the floor pushing a button to bring him back up to the penthouse where a new script awaits.The plot and setting is incredibly simple: An elevator with five passengers gets stuck between floors.  One of the passengers is the devil.  Guess who it is.The execution of this movie is nearly flawless.  When lights flicker, danger is present.  Death will almost certainly ensure.  Figuring out who is responsible for the deaths is what makes the movie interesting.  With each guess the viewer must contradict preconceived notions and attempts to rationalize why someone is or is not the killer.  Anyone who says they watched this movie and figured it all out without the red herrings and strawmen causing doubt is lying.  A detective is introduced to help expedite the investigation.  Aimless at first, he begins to piece together details about each of the elevator's occupants.  His journey serves as both enlightenment during dark and distraction during light.  The fear from each of the passengers relates to the basic claustrophobia we all have, but, more importantly, intermittently takes away two of the passengers' senses (sight & speech).  With each minute they are stuck, the passengers' terror get increasingly more palpable until they're tighter than a snare drum.

1371420,A2JBVRCJ8VS7PQ,B003Y5H4SO,Jerry (Celil) Parker,"[1, 1]","Some reviewers have expressed contempt for this extraordinarily suspenseful and mysterious film, &#34;Devil&#34; (Universal 13693-C being the North American DVD edition viewed), for the coincidences that occur in profusion individually and together to the quarrelling sinners trapped in a stalled elevator as a demon (or Lucifer himself) wreaks havoc among them and upon others. However, some of those having commented negatively need to be reminded that, whether or not they believe that there really are supernatural forces at work in this world and in The Beyond, it is the very nature of the supernatural, benevolent or evil, to bring to pass what otherwise would not, or even could not, take place otherwise in the natural world. The film is about the supernatural, essentially about the Christian concept of the Satanic, so why should such viewers be so offended at that? If they wish to dismiss the supernatural as invalid even as a topic merely for entertainment, then it is obvious that a motion picture like this one is not for them. So what?As for evil acts catching up, to dire effect, with their perpetrators, Hindoos and Buddhists believe that, too, in their own way, through their concept of Karma; Christians express it in a different way (and Grace, illustrated at this film's end, also enters into the moral and spiritual equation, and ultimate divine and human consequences, too, for those believers), so that premise, too, has wide appeal, whatever militant rationalists and unbelievers may think according to their own world view.Those who cannot stand the very mention of such matters simply should bypass this movie, not condemn it on their presuppositions. As for me, having had for many decades to endure the intrusion of occult phenomena into my life (called &#34;demonic oppression&#34;), even to the point of needing exorcism at one point, I do not find the portrayal of evil in &#34;Devil&#34; at all lacking in conviction or credibility.The film is wonderfully suspenseful and, at least for this viewer, things did not turn out, step by step or altogether, as expected. The acting, too, is terrific, especially in the parts that Chris Messina and Logan Marshall-Green take to such handsome and dramatic effect.The DVD edition mentioned above has a few special features, but they are quite brief and add only minimally to the appeal of the product or to understanding the film and the characters in it. One can understand why the deleted scenes were not in the final movie, for they do not add much that is illuminating, either.",5,"A Film That Takes the Demonic Seriously, Also Human Responsability and Guilt for Sin, with Some Room for Grace to Assert Itself",1397520000,"04 15, 2014",2014,2557,"['reviewers', 'have', 'expressed', 'contempt', 'extraordinarily', 'suspenseful', 'mysterious', 'film', '34', 'Devil', '34', '13693-C', 'being', 'North', 'American', 'DVD', 'edition', 'viewed', 'coincidences', 'occur', 'profusion', 'individually', 'together', 'quarrelling', 'sinners', 'trapped', 'stalled', 'elevator', 'demon', 'Lucifer', 'havoc', 'others', 'However', 'having', 'commented', 'negatively', 'need', 'be', 'reminded', 'not', 'believe', 'really', 'are', 'supernatural', 'forces', 'work', 'world', 'Beyond', 'very', 'nature', 'supernatural', 'benevolent', 'evil', 'bring', 'pass', 'what', 'otherwise', 'would', 'not', 'even', 'could', 'not', 'take', 'place', 'otherwise', 'natural', 'world', 'film', 'supernatural', 'essentially', 'Christian', 'concept', 'Satanic', 'so', 'why', 'should', 'such', 'viewers', 'be', 'so', 'offended', 'wish', 'dismiss', 'supernatural', 'invalid', 'even', 'topic', 'merely', 'entertainment', 'then', 'obvious', 'motion', 'picture', 'one', 'not', 'So', 'what', 'evil', 'acts', 'catching', 'up', 'dire', 'effect', 'perpetrators', 'Hindoos', 'Buddhists', 'believe', 'too', 'own', 'way', 'concept', 'Karma', 'Christians', 'express', 'different', 'way', 'Grace', 'illustrated', 'film', 'end', 'also', 'moral', 'spiritual', 'equation', 'ultimate', 'divine', 'human', 'consequences', 'too', 'believers', 'so', 'premise', 'too', 'wide', 'appeal', 'militant', 'rationalists', 'unbelievers', 'may', 'think', 'according', 'own', 'world', 'view.Those', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'stand', 'very', 'mention', 'such', 'matters', 'simply', 'should', 'bypass', 'movie', 'not', 'condemn', 'presuppositions', 'having', 'had', 'many', 'decades', 'endure', 'intrusion', 'occult', 'phenomena', 'life', 'called', '34', 'demonic', 'oppression', '34', 'even', 'point', 'needing', 'exorcism', 'one', 'point', 'do', 'not', 'find', 'portrayal', 'evil', '34', 'Devil', '34', 'lacking', 'conviction', 'credibility.The', 'film', 'wonderfully', 'suspenseful', 'least', 'viewer', 'things', 'did', 'not', 'turn', 'out', 'step', 'step', 'altogether', 'expected', 'acting', 'too', 'terrific', 'especially', 'parts', 'Chris', 'Messina', 'Logan', 'Marshall-Green', 'take', 'such', 'handsome', 'dramatic', 'effect.The', 'DVD', 'edition', 'mentioned', 'few', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'quite', 'brief', 'only', 'minimally', 'appeal', 'product', 'understanding', 'film', 'characters', 'One', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'were', 'not', 'final', 'movie', 'do', 'not', 'add', 'much', 'illuminating']",N/A

This bit of dialogue is not meant to be taken seriously; on the contrary, one gets the sense that producer M. Night Shymalan is himself aware that people no longer expect brilliance from him, so why take himself so seriously? The ruse of the movie is Hitchcockian, and in that sense works very well: five people are trapped in an elevator and none of them are what one might call moral giants.  A mechanic (Logan Marshall-Green), an old woman (Jenny O'Hara), a young woman (Bojana Novakovic), a guard (Bokeem Woodbine) and a salesman (Geoffrey Arend) are very quick to lose their patience, panic, and start treating each other like garbage when their elevator becomes stuck. The point, of course, is that one of these five people is Satan, him or herself, and things go according to it's plan very well for awhile.No, this movie isn't going to change your life, nor is it meant to--but the ambiance Shymalan creates of having two hands around your neck is as good as any Twilight Zone episode I've seen, or any quality short horror film.  He focuses so much on the *faces* of each person in the unfortunate loft that one thinks of Polanksi in his more chilling films (""Rosemary's Baby"") or the mounting tension of real life horror classics (""The Silence of the Lambs"").  While this film does not quite match up to either of these classics, it is quite something to watch and the ending is not predictable at all.  It approaches from an angle which throws disbelief out the window immediately, and even Detective Bowden (Chris Messina) is forced to take a closer look at what he believes by the end.

1371424,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,B003Y5H4SO,John's Horror Corner,"[4, 5]","When a movie can seize our attention during the opening credits and maintain it throughout--well, we're in for something good.  An impressive score, ominous but beautiful cinematography and exquisite camerawork transform this movie from ""decent"" to a very different and enjoyable experience.  It strikes me as well-written and well-acted by a team of underrated actors.  It's not gruesome or horrifying, but it kept me on my toes and, more importantly, kept my attention continuously.  This expanded one-act is a gem in an era where moviemakers place more attention in trailer-editing than movie production.  [B+ ]Folks, let's give credit where it's due.  If you skipped this movie just because Shyamalan's name was attached to it then you made a mistake.  I'll start by pointing out a key difference between this Shyamalan movie and all others: Shyamalan wrote it but did not direct it.  All of his other movies, which admittedly went downhill after The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, were both written and directed by him.  I'd also like to point out that the ideas for all of his movies had the potential to be great--really great.  But for any movie you need not only a proven director, but the right director for the movie in question.  I think they got the director right on this one:  John Erick Dowdle, who directed Quarantine, the American adaptation of the Latin phenom [REC].The movie opens with a cautionary tale about the Devil, who occasionally gathers a group of ill-fated humans to torture them one by one before stealing them away to Hell.  Cut to the opening credits we see an impressive metropolitan cityscape showcased in a distorted, upside down view to set a mood of unease--or excitement for movie thrill-seekers.  The score, as if architected to accelerate heart rates, complements the visual overtones well.  I am immediately on my toes, waiting to pick out the wolf-in-sheep's-clothing before a single hits the screen.The characters include a bereft, alcoholic detective who doubts his ability forgive, two elevator-surveillance security guards, two attractive twenty-somethings (a man and a woman), a floor security guard, a testy old woman, and a well-dressed  mattress salesman.  The game starts when we see the latter five step onto the elevator.  From this moment on, a talented movie analyst might be auditing each character's wardrobe for red or anything ""diabolical"".  But red is found on the attire of a few of them, as well as hints of red on the fabric walls of the elevator, one character's hair, the lit buttons and the digital floor number display.  Nothing is obvious, which makes random suspicions free game!Interspersed with the director's attempts to bait us into snap judgments as to who is ""the Devil"" are elevated shots of the city, some with views looking straight up or ominously down the side of their reflective, windowed surface and others shuttling through the elevator shaft.  The devout, Latin security guard (who has been doubling as an effective narrator) chimes in with his theological fears or additional details to the story which opened the movie.  As tension rises, we are left to wonder if the five on the elevator are the only people gathered by the Devil, or if the detective and surveillance security were carefully chosen as well.Suspicions shift readily and regularly.  We periodically learn new details about the characters which could be hints or red herrings.  Expressions of fear, accusation, anger and disgust festoon the faces of our elevator players.  In screenwriting they say that you don't put a gun on the wall in Act One unless it's going to fire in Act Three.  Let's just say it feels like this wall belongs to the NRA president.This movie was fun and unique.  As serial-moviegoers isn't that what we want?  Something different and enjoyable?  Something that doesn't feel like a recycled idea with a new director and different actors?  If you feel the same way, then give Shyamalan a mulligan and try this movie out!",5,This expanded one-act is a gem in an era where moviemakers place more attention in trailer-editing than movie production.,1328400000,"02 5, 2012",2012,3995,"['When', 'movie', 'can', 'seize', 'attention', 'opening', 'credits', 'maintain', 'well', ""'re"", 'something', 'good', 'impressive', 'score', 'ominous', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'exquisite', 'camerawork', 'transform', 'movie', 'decent', 'very', 'different', 'enjoyable', 'experience', 'well-written', 'well-acted', 'team', 'underrated', 'actors', 'not', 'gruesome', 'horrifying', 'kept', 'toes', 'more', 'importantly', 'kept', 'attention', 'continuously', 'expanded', 'one-act', 'gem', 'era', 'where', 'moviemakers', 'place', 'more', 'attention', 'trailer-editing', 'movie', 'production', '[', 'B+', ']', 'Folks', 'let', 'give', 'credit', 'where', 'due', 'skipped', 'movie', 'just', 'Shyamalan', 'name', 'was', 'attached', 'then', 'made', 'mistake', ""'ll"", 'start', 'pointing', 'out', 'key', 'difference', 'Shyamalan', 'movie', 'others', 'Shyamalan', 'wrote', 'did', 'not', 'direct', 'other', 'movies', 'admittedly', 'went', 'downhill', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Unbreakable', 'were', 'written', 'directed', ""'d"", 'also', 'like', 'point', 'out', 'ideas', 'movies', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'great', 'really', 'great', 'movie', 'need', 'not', 'only', 'proven', 'director', 'right', 'director', 'movie', 'question', 'think', 'got', 'director', 'right', 'one', 'John', 'Erick', 'Dowdle', 'who', 'directed', 'Quarantine', 'American', 'adaptation', 'Latin', 'phenom', '[', 'REC', ']', '.The', 'movie', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'Devil', 'who', 'occasionally', 'group', 'ill-fated', 'humans', 'torture', 'one', 'one', 'stealing', 'away', 'Hell', 'Cut', 'opening', 'see', 'impressive', 'metropolitan', 'cityscape', 'showcased', 'distorted', 'upside', 'down', 'view', 'set', 'mood', 'unease', 'excitement', 'movie', 'thrill-seekers', 'score', 'architected', 'accelerate', 'heart', 'rates', 'visual', 'overtones', 'well', 'am', 'immediately', 'toes', 'waiting', 'pick', 'out', ""wolf-in-sheep's-clothing"", 'single', 'screen.The', 'characters', 'include', 'bereft', 'alcoholic', 'detective', 'who', 'ability', 'forgive', 'two', 'elevator-surveillance', 'security', 'guards', 'two', 'attractive', 'twenty-somethings', 'man', 'woman', 'floor', 'security', 'guard', 'testy', 'old', 'woman', 'well-dressed', 'mattress', 'salesman', 'game', 'when', 'see', 'latter', 'five', 'step', 'elevator', 'moment', 'talented', 'movie', 'analyst', 'might', 'be', 'auditing', 'character', 'wardrobe', 'red', 'anything', 'diabolical', 'red', 'found', 'attire', 'few', 'as', 'well', 'hints', 'red', 'fabric', 'walls', 'elevator', 'one', 'character', 'hair', 'lit', 'buttons', 'digital', 'floor', 'number', 'display', 'Nothing', 'obvious', 'random', 'suspicions', 'free', 'game', 'Interspersed', 'director', 'attempts', 'bait', 'snap', 'judgments', 'who', 'Devil', 'are', 'elevated', 'shots', 'city', 'views', 'looking', 'straight', 'up', 'ominously', 'side', 'reflective', 'windowed', 'surface', 'others', 'shuttling', 'elevator', 'shaft', 'devout', 'Latin', 'security', 'guard', 'who', 'been', 'doubling', 'effective', 'narrator', 'theological', 'fears', 'additional', 'details', 'story', 'opened', 'movie', 'tension', 'rises', 'are', 'left', 'wonder', 'five', 'elevator', 'are', 'only', 'people', 'gathered', 'Devil', 'detective', 'surveillance', 'security', 'were', 'carefully', 'chosen', 'well.Suspicions', 'shift', 'readily', 'regularly', 'periodically', 'learn', 'new', 'details', 'characters', 'could', 'be', 'hints', 'red', 'herrings', 'Expressions', 'fear', 'accusation', 'anger', 'disgust', 'festoon', 'elevator', 'players', 'screenwriting', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'put', 'gun', 'wall', 'Act', 'One', 'going', 'fire', 'Act', 'Three', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'wall', 'NRA', 'president.This', 'movie', 'was', 'fun', 'unique', 'serial-moviegoers', ""n't"", 'what', 'want', 'Something', 'different', 'enjoyable', 'Something', ""n't"", 'feel', 'recycled', 'idea', 'new', 'director', 'different', 'actors', 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'then', 'give', 'Shyamalan', 'mulligan', 'try', 'movie', 'out']",N/A

1371428,A1DJMQJ3NY7TV5,B003Y5H4SO,Jordan David,"[3, 5]","Look...okay, I get it:  Shayamalan was running out of time.  How many of you were dismissing him?  This was the guy that emptied his soul into an obscure 90's thriller that took the industry by storm with it's iconic elements and unforgettable quotes in ""I see dead people"".  Alas, his career appeared to, ultimately, be an academic observation in constructive downfall and destruction, and it was truly difficult to fathom why.  I mean, he hadn't changed much, had he?  The insultingly blatant twists were there; the seat-squirmingly uncomfortable dialogue was there.Truth be told, Shayamalan has not evolved, regardless of how much I wanted him to.  The guy's a man with vision, even if something seems to be clouding said vision with the unappealing plaque and oils that only a stubborn man can conceive.  It's unfortunate, and a little sad, really, for Shayamalan was, and still is, a director with the potential to shake the industry yet again - for the better, I mean....But enough about this; this is NOT a movie about Shayamalan.  It's not, I assure you.  On the contrary, ""Devil"" is a film that belongs to Drew and John Dowdle, truly.  Don't let the publicity fool you (and it will, trust me) - Shayamalan's stamp, for better or for worse, has little say in this matter.  His influence permeates through the imagery and the dialogue, certainly (and ultimately for the worse) but let it be known that, if you're looking for another movie to add to Shayamalan's embarrassments, look elsewhere.I feel as if I need to get this out the way early, as it seems that the disdain for Shayamalan has exceeded rational limitations.  The man is a director in stubborn transition - what more is there to say?  You need not dwell on his name as it flashes through the credits of this effective, albeit sluggish, thriller.With that in mind, let it be known that ""Devil"" is one that finds itself rather quickly, even if it doesn't CARRY itself particularly well in the first place.  It's a film that takes far too long to speed up, falsely believing that tension arises from, seemingly, nothing.  That's hardly how it works.  ""Devil"" is a movie with the pacing of an epic, but the run time of a B - flick it's hardly a sound combination, but things eventually converge for the better when both the premise and the actors find their voice.And when things pick up, they do so quickly.  ""Devil"" is often a fascinating thriller that leaves us with questions, even if those questions aren't very enticing.  First and foremost, it is a film of terror, but it's strengths lie in its ability to mesh mystery with suspense, and the end result is fascinatingly more pronounced than five people in an elevator would have you believe.More so than almost every other film I have witnessed in this past year, ""Devil"" owes itself to committed performances; I know it's an uninspired term, but it needs to be reiterated.  Novakovic, Green, Woodbine, Arend, and O'hara are all comfortably fit for their roles in their own way, and Messina is, ultimately, a solid scouting fit for the skeptical detective.For those of you holding out on ""Devil"" because of its screenwriter's track record, I implore you to think otherwise; this is a principle that goes beyond simply dismissing entertainment because of one influence it may have.  Shayamalan's ""vision"" is here, yes, and it even rears its ugly head, from time to time (with toast, no less).  However, this doesn't stop ""Devil"" from being an often fascinating, if ultimately trivial, thriller,",3,Devil,1324166400,"12 18, 2011",2011,3517,"['Look', 'okay', 'get', 'Shayamalan', 'was', 'running', 'time', 'How', 'many', 'were', 'dismissing', 'was', 'guy', 'emptied', 'soul', 'obscure', '90', 'thriller', 'took', 'industry', 'storm', 'iconic', 'elements', 'unforgettable', 'quotes', 'see', 'dead', 'people', 'Alas', 'career', 'appeared', 'ultimately', 'be', 'academic', 'observation', 'constructive', 'downfall', 'destruction', 'was', 'truly', 'difficult', 'fathom', 'why', 'mean', 'had', ""n't"", 'changed', 'much', 'had', 'insultingly', 'blatant', 'twists', 'were', 'there', 'seat-squirmingly', 'uncomfortable', 'dialogue', 'was', 'there.Truth', 'be', 'told', 'Shayamalan', 'not', 'evolved', 'regardless', 'how', 'much', 'wanted', 'guy', 'man', 'vision', 'even', 'something', 'be', 'clouding', 'said', 'vision', 'unappealing', 'plaque', 'oils', 'only', 'stubborn', 'man', 'can', 'conceive', 'unfortunate', 'little', 'sad', 'really', 'Shayamalan', 'was', 'still', 'director', 'potential', 'shake', 'industry', 'yet', 'again', 'better', 'mean', '.But', 'enough', 'NOT', 'movie', 'Shayamalan', 'not', 'assure', 'contrary', 'Devil', 'film', 'Drew', 'John', 'Dowdle', 'truly', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'publicity', 'fool', 'will', 'trust', 'Shayamalan', 'stamp', 'better', 'worse', 'little', 'say', 'matter', 'influence', 'imagery', 'dialogue', 'certainly', 'ultimately', 'worse', 'let', 'be', 'known', ""'re"", 'looking', 'movie', 'add', 'Shayamalan', 'embarrassments', 'look', 'elsewhere.I', 'feel', 'need', 'get', 'out', 'way', 'early', 'disdain', 'Shayamalan', 'exceeded', 'rational', 'limitations', 'man', 'director', 'stubborn', 'transition', 'what', 'more', 'there', 'say', 'need', 'not', 'dwell', 'name', 'credits', 'effective', 'albeit', 'sluggish', 'thriller.With', 'mind', 'let', 'be', 'known', 'Devil', 'one', 'rather', 'quickly', 'even', ""n't"", 'CARRY', 'particularly', 'well', 'first', 'place', 'film', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'speed', 'up', 'falsely', 'believing', 'tension', 'arises', 'seemingly', 'nothing', 'hardly', 'how', 'Devil', 'movie', 'pacing', 'epic', 'run', 'time', 'B', 'flick', 'hardly', 'sound', 'combination', 'things', 'eventually', 'converge', 'better', 'when', 'premise', 'actors', 'find', 'voice.And', 'when', 'things', 'pick', 'up', 'do', 'so', 'quickly', 'Devil', 'often', 'fascinating', 'thriller', 'questions', 'even', 'questions', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'enticing', 'First', 'foremost', 'film', 'terror', 'strengths', 'lie', 'ability', 'mesh', 'mystery', 'suspense', 'end', 'result', 'fascinatingly', 'more', 'pronounced', 'five', 'people', 'elevator', 'would', 'have', 'believe.More', 'so', 'almost', 'other', 'film', 'have', 'witnessed', 'past', 'year', 'Devil', 'committed', 'performances', 'know', 'uninspired', 'term', 'be', 'reiterated', 'Novakovic', 'Green', 'Woodbine', 'Arend', ""O'hara"", 'are', 'comfortably', 'fit', 'roles', 'own', 'way', 'Messina', 'ultimately', 'solid', 'scouting', 'fit', 'skeptical', 'detective.For', 'holding', 'out', 'Devil', 'screenwriter', 'track', 'record', 'implore', 'think', 'otherwise', 'principle', 'simply', 'dismissing', 'entertainment', 'one', 'influence', 'may', 'have', 'Shayamalan', 'vision', 'here', 'yes', 'even', 'ugly', 'head', 'time', 'time', 'toast', 'less', 'However', ""n't"", 'stop', 'Devil', 'being', 'often', 'fascinating', 'ultimately', 'trivial', 'thriller']",N/A

1371440,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B003Y5H4SO,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[1, 1]","Surprisingly clever and cleverly surprising - a quite succesful film about the Devil in the elevator...I liked this movie much more than I expected, from the first scenes until the very last sentence.Contrary to many other reviewers I rather like M. Night Shyamalan style and I appreciated not only his &#34;Sixth Sense&#34;, but also &#34;The village&#34;, &#34;Lady in the Water&#34; and even &#34;The Last Airbender&#34; - so this may be because of my personal taste that I liked &#34;Devil&#34; so much. But still, I think there are some very good elements in this movie, which make it enjoyable for just anybody - below some examples, with very limited SPOILERS:- the opening scenes - I will not tell you exactly what happens, but the film begins with a very special vision of our world (on the example of the good city of Philadelphia) and it immediately creates an atmosphere of unease and fear, which will later slowly but regularly escalate with every minute...- the music - it is a subtler and more delicate but still quite threatening variation on the &#34;Omen&#34; soundtrack; the music is extremely well used to strengthen the impact of words and images- actors - they are all unknown (at least they were to me) and that is a good thing, because we have absolutely not a clue who will make it until the end and who will die in the first minutes...- the claustrophobic setting - most of the film takes place in a blocked elevator, in which lights flicker and sometimes vanish completely, before returning - OK, may be it seems a kind of rather easy and old trick, but it worked for me...- mystery - I absolutely couldn't figure who was the Devil until the end - the final surprise is well preserved- the Devil - he is quite terrifying when finally revealed, in a very particular way - although you will probably have to digest the scene of his appearance for a moment before you fully realise how scary it is...; also I liked the explanation of how and why exactly the Devil is allowed (for a limited time) to come in this world in a material form (and not just as a spirit whispering bad advice in our ears)- a rather respectful approach to the Christianity - as opposite to most of recent movies, the one pious person appearing in the movie is not a babbling fool or raving fanatic, but a simple but brave fellow who in his very simple ways shows unexpectedly more useful knowledge and real wisdom that all the highly educated, but rather cynical people surrounding him; I liked this quite a lotNow, this is just a movie, so the director and the scenario writer had to take some liberties with Christian dogma - in which it is plainly explained that Satan has no material control of this world and can not do any physical harm to people - he is Temptation, not Murder; and if he can torment us with bad thoughts, he can not as much as touch one of our hairs; but once again, this is just a movie - and the final result of this (little) heresy is so pleasant (or unpleasant if you prefer), that I fully forgive the author and the directorBottom line - I liked this movie quite a lot; OK, it is not &#34;Omen&#34; or &#34;Exorcist&#34;, but still, it is a very very clever and surprising horror movie - with an exceptionally good punch line.",5,Surprisingly clever and cleverly surprising - a quite succesful film about the Devil in the elevator...,1326672000,"01 16, 2012",2012,3254,"['Surprisingly', 'clever', 'cleverly', 'surprising', 'quite', 'succesful', 'film', 'Devil', 'elevator', 'liked', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'expected', 'first', 'scenes', 'very', 'last', 'sentence.Contrary', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'rather', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'style', 'appreciated', 'not', 'only', '34', 'Sixth', 'Sense', '34', 'also', '34', 'village', '34', '34', 'Lady', 'Water', '34', 'even', '34', 'Last', 'Airbender', '34', 'may', 'be', 'personal', 'taste', 'liked', '34', 'Devil', '34', 'so', 'much', 'still', 'think', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'elements', 'movie', 'make', 'enjoyable', 'just', 'anybody', 'examples', 'very', 'limited', 'SPOILERS', 'opening', 'will', 'not', 'tell', 'exactly', 'what', 'film', 'very', 'special', 'vision', 'world', 'example', 'good', 'city', 'Philadelphia', 'immediately', 'atmosphere', 'unease', 'fear', 'will', 'later', 'slowly', 'regularly', 'escalate', 'minute', 'music', 'subtler', 'more', 'delicate', 'still', 'quite', 'threatening', 'variation', '34', 'Omen', '34', 'soundtrack', 'music', 'extremely', 'well', 'used', 'strengthen', 'impact', 'words', 'images-', 'actors', 'are', 'unknown', 'least', 'were', 'good', 'thing', 'have', 'absolutely', 'not', 'clue', 'who', 'will', 'make', 'end', 'who', 'will', 'die', 'first', 'minutes', 'claustrophobic', 'setting', 'most', 'film', 'place', 'blocked', 'elevator', 'lights', 'flicker', 'sometimes', 'vanish', 'completely', 'returning', 'OK', 'may', 'be', 'kind', 'rather', 'easy', 'old', 'trick', 'worked', 'mystery', 'absolutely', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'who', 'was', 'Devil', 'end', 'final', 'surprise', 'well', 'preserved-', 'Devil', 'quite', 'terrifying', 'when', 'finally', 'revealed', 'very', 'particular', 'way', 'will', 'probably', 'have', 'digest', 'scene', 'appearance', 'moment', 'fully', 'realise', 'how', 'scary', 'also', 'liked', 'explanation', 'how', 'why', 'exactly', 'Devil', 'allowed', 'limited', 'time', 'come', 'world', 'material', 'form', 'not', 'just', 'spirit', 'whispering', 'bad', 'advice', 'ears', 'rather', 'respectful', 'approach', 'Christianity', 'opposite', 'most', 'recent', 'movies', 'one', 'pious', 'person', 'appearing', 'movie', 'not', 'babbling', 'fool', 'raving', 'fanatic', 'simple', 'brave', 'fellow', 'who', 'very', 'simple', 'ways', 'unexpectedly', 'more', 'useful', 'knowledge', 'real', 'wisdom', 'highly', 'educated', 'rather', 'cynical', 'people', 'surrounding', 'liked', 'quite', 'lotNow', 'just', 'movie', 'director', 'scenario', 'writer', 'had', 'take', 'liberties', 'Christian', 'dogma', 'plainly', 'explained', 'Satan', 'material', 'control', 'world', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'physical', 'harm', 'people', 'Temptation', 'not', 'Murder', 'can', 'torment', 'bad', 'thoughts', 'can', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'touch', 'one', 'hairs', 'once', 'again', 'just', 'movie', 'final', 'result', 'little', 'heresy', 'so', 'pleasant', 'unpleasant', 'prefer', 'fully', 'forgive', 'author', 'directorBottom', 'line', 'liked', 'movie', 'quite', 'lot', 'OK', 'not', '34', 'Omen', '34', '34', 'Exorcist', '34', 'still', 'very', 'very', 'clever', 'surprising', 'horror', 'movie', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'punch', 'line']",N/A

This is a well above average movie that delivers the goods in terms of suspense, horror, anxiety, terror and surprises.

It also interwines a variety of story lines very well which culminate at the end of the movie.  The movie comes at you from all directions, but keeping the focus on the events which are happening and not forgetting where the action truly is.  For a movie which features the Devil himself, the kills/death/gore are not too over the top but definetly not recommended for children.

The movie has a stunning ending. The identity of Satan among the elevator passengers is shocking.

There are a few scenes that are filmed outside of the elevator as the modern world tries to understand what is going on inside that metal coffin, but the majority of &#34;Devil&#34; is very much a stage play where all the characters are suspects and it's up to the audience to figure it out.There's the sleazeball salesman (Geoffrey Arend), the jilted rich wife (Bojana Novakovic), the security guard with a history of violence (Bokeem Woodbine), the elderly thief (Jenny O'Hara), and the cypher (Logan Marshall-Green).The witnesses are just as important to this story as the victims. Witnessing his morality play in the elevator are two security guards and a cop: narrator Ramirez (Jacob Vargas), his boss Lustig (Matt Craven), and Detective Bowden (Chris Messina, from The Mindy Project). Ramirez sets the plot up: The Devil seeks out sinners, traps them, turns them against each other, and then kills them off one by one, with the last victim to die in front of his loved ones to make the world a more cynical place.What ensues is a relentless escalation of tension as one by one the victims die in the elevator. Outside, all rescue attempts end in gruesome accidents. In parallel with the events in the elevator, Bowden tests out an evolving hypothesis as to who the murderer is, revealing new twists with each piece of evidence he uncovers.What's interesting about &#34;Devil&#34; is how it juxtaposes a ridiculous situation (The Devil is real! People can be murdered within five feet of each other without knowing who did it!) contrasted with direct surveillance by trained observers (CCTV in the elevator recorded and monitored by police).  &#34;Devil&#34; slowly strips away everything we know about modern technology until we're left embracing the supernatural solution.&#34;Devil&#34;'s creepy mood and cat-and-mouse game evokes predecessors like &#34;Ten Little Indians&#34; and &#34;Cube.&#34; But its plot twist will seem hauntingly familiar and for good reason.  &#34;Devil&#34; was produced by M.

The movie kicks off with a suicide of someone jumping out of a sky-rise building window to their death. From where the person jumped from is the building that contains an elevator that has stopped in its tracks, and maintenance and security can't seem to find what's wrong with it to get it going again and free the 5 people stuck inside of it. However, one of these people happens to be Satan, and along the way you can bet blood will be spilled. The entire movie is not set within the elevator tho, there is outside communication with security and the superstitious religious man who helps explain to the audience what is supposedly happening, as well as a couple of Philadelphia defectives and a bunch of other people around the building area, so the whole movie is not just set in a claustrophobic small room.The premises of the thing is pretty much what you would guess it to be, it's a ""which of them is the devil""? sort of slight mystery, and the outcome is not all that highly predictable, as my girlfriend and I where betting on who it would turn out to be, she may have guessed it correctly, but that comes down to you have a choice of about 5 people to guess from, or think outside of the box.Overall, it's not a bad movie, but I really don't think it's one to watch again once you know the outcome.

Reynard ""kairosdreaming""","[1, 3]","*May contain spoilers*Because everything else that sounded interesting was in 3D (which makes me ill) we decided to give Devil a try.  Written by M. Night Shyamalan and directed by John Dowdle, this horror/suspense movie was merely average.We start out by listening to the narrator tell us a story his mom used to tell him.  The basic gist of it is that when a person commits suicide, it opens a gate for the devil to get through.  The devil will then have a grand old time killing people trapped in a confined space while spectators watch powerless to stop it.  Then, we immediately see someone commit suicide.At this point you know what's going to happen and silently cringe when you see five people enter an elevator in the same building the person committed suicide. These people are a temp guard (Bokeem Woodbine, a young woman (Bojana Novakovic), a mechanic (Logan Marshall-Green, an older woman (Jenny O'Hara), and an annoying slimy salesman (Geoffrey Arend).  Everything seems normal until their elevator stumbles to a halt.  The lights start acting up, music starts playing for no good reason, and every time it turns dark, someone dies.  They all think the worst of each other, never really knowing what is happening to them.  Detective Bowden (Chris Messina) and Ramirez our narrator (Jacob Vargas) was on as they try to rescue these people from their plight.For a horror movie, I was thankful that they kept the gore to a minimum.  The killings were also very low key due to the dark that kept happening in the elevator as well.  This was a little better for the more squeamish who might decide to watch this movie.  It centered more around plot in this case, which is some ways was good and some ways was bad.  Certainly it was better to have a story rather than a random killing spree, but in actuality, the story was somewhat boring.  Having been told what was going to happen originally by the narrator, you were just watching events play out instead of trying to guess what would happen next.There was some music in this movie.  However, being that it was in an elevator, it was elevator music, and only one song played sporadically through most of the movie.  There might have been some other music during other scenes, but i don't recall it so if there was it wasn't noticeable.The actors were decent.  Jenny O'Hara is kind of always an odd ball character to me and she didn't surprise me by venturing out of that role for this film.  The rest of the actors were new to me so I didn't have a standing opinion of any of them.  Now after the movie was over, I still don't.  They did well enough, it was just going back to the fact that the plot was somewhat slow that I think they didn't have a great opportunity to really dazzle us with their acting.I probably won't go rushing out to buy this movie.  I might not even volunteer to see it again.  It wasn't terrible, but really just wasn't good enough to spend another couple hours watching again.Review by M.

First, it is his first film where he uses a well established plot line as the basis of his movie, unlike all his prior films.  Second, the film uses a cast of essentially unknowns, whereas all his prior films were anchored by at least one, and unusually two stars, with names like Bruce Willis, Mark Wahlberg, and William Hurt gracing the screen.  Third, this is his first film with bloody violence throughout, as we see multiple people die gruesome deaths.  Overall, the film is good with perfect pacing and mixing of dialogue and action.  The finale bears some semblance to the finale of his prior films, an interesting twist to bring everything and everyone together.",4,Beginning of a comeback for a forlorn director,1387756800,"12 23, 2013",2013,1200,"['M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'broke', 'out', 'Hollywood', 'two', 'films', 'opposite', 'end', 'spectrum', '1999', 'Stuart', 'Little', 'families', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'adults', 'then', 'topped', 'out', 'Unbreakable', 'Signs', 'then', 'been', 'downhill', 'flops', 'such', 'Lady', 'Water', 'Last', 'Airbender', 'However', 'might', 'be', 'coming', 'back', 'form', 'tight', 'thriller', 'released', '2010', 'Going', 'old', 'school', 'film', 'devil', 'walking', 'living', 'Devil', 'first', 'Mr.', 'Shyamalan', 'multiple', 'fronts', 'First', 'first', 'film', 'where', 'well', 'established', 'plot', 'line', 'basis', 'movie', 'prior', 'films', 'Second', 'film', 'cast', 'essentially', 'unknowns', 'prior', 'films', 'were', 'anchored', 'least', 'one', 'unusually', 'two', 'stars', 'names', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'William', 'Hurt', 'gracing', 'screen', 'Third', 'first', 'film', 'bloody', 'violence', 'see', 'multiple', 'people', 'die', 'gruesome', 'deaths', 'Overall', 'film', 'good', 'perfect', 'pacing', 'mixing', 'dialogue', 'action', 'finale', 'semblance', 'finale', 'prior', 'films', 'interesting', 'twist', 'bring', 'everything', 'everyone', 'together']",N/A

1371466,A2QDSG599HSWVA,B003Y5H4SO,Patrick Wilkinson,"[6, 11]","Another fantasy horror for adults from writer M. Night Shyamalan. Unfortunately, this movie falls into the same traps as most of his other films. There was promise with this film, I was hoping for something different, something tense and scary with an unexpected twist. This is not what I got. I was a fan of ""Signs"", ""Unbreakable"", ""The Sixth Sense"" and even ""Lady In The Water"". These films had great actors and scripts along with good production values. ""Devil"" had some good actors, some not, the script was laughable and the story had gigantic plot holes. M. Night can think up some great themes but ultimately fails to portray them on screen. Granted, he wasn't the director in this outing, so I can't fault him completely. Director John Erick Dowdle did not impress me and I suspect M. Night was probably breathing down his neck during production.The premise is that a group of characters with their own dark secrets all get trapped in an elevator while the Devil torments them and begins killing them off. While all of this mayhem is taking place in the elevator, a detective and religious security guard watch from the control room trying to figure out who in the lift is killing everyone.What worked? Well, there were only a few things. The score was great. Composer Fernando Velazquez created a haunting atmosphere and was probably the highlight of the film for me. I generally dislike a lot of music in horror movies, but this proves that if well done it can be very effective. The tension was also there, though, it was broken up too often by switching to the control room during some of the most tense moments. Lastly, the cinematography was pretty good. Keeping the action to a confined space was a huge part of the story obviously and Tak Fujimoto did a really good job with the lighting and camera angles.My biggest problem with this film are the holes in the story. I won't point them out here, but you will ultimately find them. It is really disappointing because this topic/story had potential. M. Night needs to have more people reviewing his work prior to production pointing out the holes. I can't help but think this film would have been a huge success had it been in the hands of a different director and script writer. Michael Haneke for instance would have been a perfect fit for this. ""Devil"" also tried too hard to foreshadow without giving away the mystery. We are told numerous times throughout the film how the Devil works, such as taking human form, killing those who get in his way, etc. These hints made the ending much less effective. I also was really upset at the title/credit sequences. I realize these are not that big of a deal, but in ""Devil"" these scenes were meant to be symbolic. Unfortunately they were one of the most cheesy I've seen in a long time.I could really go on and on about the things that went wrong in this film but who wants to read all of that? Just know that if you want an interesting concept you will find it here. If you want an enjoyable and well made film, you may want to go elsewhere.",2,"Poor M.

What I don't understand about the premise is this: instead of killing these folks wouldn't the Devil reward them handily by offering a flaming chariot ride- and cash prizes- to the underworld?  If these folks possessed such flawed resume's why not recruit them to the dark side as limited partners instead of killing them in an act of supposed retribution.

I have never much liked most of Shyamalan's films, however in the case of this one though he didn't direct it, and that's probably a good thing. His films I think are all decent, especially The Sixth Sense and Signs, but none of them are extroardinary movies, but certainly good films. I think people expect too much of Shyamalan because The Sixth Sense in it's time was a pretty good movie, and during the time of it's release people weren't making thrillers much, so The Sixth Sense got more praise than it probably deserved. But Shyamalan does know how to write a good thriller and that is his true strong point. In essence the creative writer in a project is the most important ingredient. if the story isn't any good there isn't going to be a good script, and if the script isn't any good then the finished product will suffer no matter how good the director is, so Shyamalan should be taken seriously in that respect. As a director he's really very good at it but not up there with many of the best directors. However his story of the Devil trapped in an elevator with 4 other people was a great idea. The film is not particualryl terrifying, but there are some moments that are creepy, and there are some mild scares here and there. Another thing is I don't buy is the members who reviewed this said they figured out right away who the Devil was. There was no indication what so ever that the person who ended up being the actual Devil was in fact the beast. So there is no way they could have guessed it. No loose ends or clues at all to lead one to guess correctly. Perhaps a wild guess but that's just about it. I did enjoy the movie, but it's just the standard thriller with a little spiritual message thrown in at the end. Not really scary though.

It could easily have been told in a 60 minute TV episode (including commercials).  Apparently this tale ""sprung"" from the mind of M. Night Shyamalan...and I like the inclination to tell little scary ""short stories"" via a film series.  However, I think I might like the idea even better if this became, let's say, an hour long series on Showtime.  DEVIL is so modest in scale and ambition that it felt a little like a rip-off to pay movie theater prices to see it.DEVIL tells the story of five people who become trapped together in an elevator in a high-rise building in Philadelphia.  And it tells how all efforts to save them prove fruitless (and even fatal).  As the police get involved, it becomes evident that something supernatural is causing all this.  One by one, the passengers meet terrible ends.  (It almost feels like a claustrophobic, modern-day version of Agatha Christie's novel AND THEN THERE WERE NONE.)The movie moves along at a brisk pace, but a lot of the action feels unneeded.  The role of the main detective (Chris Messina) is practically unneeded...except for the final couple of scenes.  He's the single biggest character, yet he's fairly tangential to most of what is going on.The film has been marketed as a horror story, and the title certainly feeds that.  What's more horrible than The Devil, after all?  And yet, partially because it's PG-13 and thus shies away from gore...it feels more like a supernatural mystery.The film, directed by John Erick Dowdle, who also helmed QUARANTINE (a movie I liked, even though everyone else hated that it was a remake of a Spanish film), kept my interest, was modestly suspenseful and was respectably acted.  Simply put, it is competently put together...but no matter how well it may have been done, the script/story are simply too skimpy.  The film has a couple of twists...but they don't begin to approach the game-changing impact of THE SIXTH SENSE.  It is not fair to expect every movie with a twist to knock us out like SENSE...but in DEVIL, the little twists made me think, ""wow, this ENTIRE movie has been made just to get to this minor surprise.

1371473,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B003Y5H4SO,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Devil (John Erick Dowdle, 2010)I will admit right up front that part of my rating of Devil is my fault, not the movie's; I watched the horrific non-Asylum mockbuster of Devil, a crappy no-budget knockoff called Elevator, a few months before I watched the original film. I probably also had my expectations lowered by M. Night Shyamalan's name being attached, since Shyamalan hasn't actually made a decent film since 2000's Unbreakable; here he's limited to a co-writing credit, but that didn't stop the movie's advance-publicity team from splashing his name, rather than Dowdle's, all over the ads. Not a great idea; Dowdle is much less well-known, but his first few films showed a great deal of promise, and his first big Hollywood production, Quarantine, is one of the few Hollywood horror remakes that isn't absolute crap. Devil isn't as good as that, nor as good as Dowdle's last original, 2007's The Poughkeepsie Tapes, but it's good enough for a watch, and it's nice to see Dowdle doing something that isn't gimmicky (Poughkeepsie, like Quarantine, is an entry in the found-footage subgenre).Plot: Five people on an elevator. One of them is actually the devil. Is it the temp security guard (Riddick's Bokeem Woodbine), who just started working at the building this morning? The slick salesman (Super Troopers' Geofrrey Arend), the slimy guy everyone else in the elevator immediately grows to hate? The acerbic old lady (Mystic River's Jenny O'Hara) who doesn't have a nice word for anyone, and gets an order of magnitude more abusive once the elevator gets stuck? The fashionista (Drag Me to Hell's Bojana Novikovic) who tries to act as a mediator for all these explosive personalities? Or is it the guy we see at the beginning of the movie lurking around the front door looking suspicious in a hoodie (Prometheus' Logan Marshall-Green)? While all this is going on, a pair of cops (Argo's Chris Messina and Pacific Rim's Josh Peace) are investigating a suicide earlier in the day in the same building that may or may not tie into it all, and two security guards (Crimson Tide's Matt Craven and Death Race's Jacob Vargas) are trying whatever they can to get the elevator running again.That the &#8220;OH, WTF&#8221; plot twist towards the end can be spotted from a mile away (you'll probably know it's coming from the moment it's set up, I did) is a letdown, but that concerns a subplot in the film that, honestly, you can probably ignore. You're not here for subplots anyway (though the cheesiness of it is, well, worthy of M. Night Shyamalan), you're here for the devil in an elevator. And in that respect, Dowdle delivers; the &#8220;who's who?&#8221; angle is handled with a deft enough touch that you should be kept enough in the dark to be able to enjoy what you're seeing, even if it comes with some groans when all the pieces are put together. This one could have been much better than it is with some judicious editing, but what we got is watchable enough. ** ",3,I haven't been out in ages...,1393027200,"02 22, 2014",2014,2975,"['Devil', 'John', 'Erick', 'Dowdle', '2010', 'will', 'admit', 'right', 'up', 'front', 'part', 'rating', 'Devil', 'fault', 'not', 'movie', 'watched', 'horrific', 'non-Asylum', 'mockbuster', 'Devil', 'crappy', 'no-budget', 'knockoff', 'called', 'Elevator', 'few', 'months', 'watched', 'original', 'film', 'probably', 'also', 'had', 'expectations', 'lowered', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'name', 'being', 'attached', 'Shyamalan', ""n't"", 'actually', 'made', 'decent', 'film', '2000', 'Unbreakable', 'here', 'limited', 'co-writing', 'credit', 'did', ""n't"", 'stop', 'movie', 'advance-publicity', 'team', 'splashing', 'name', 'rather', 'Dowdle', 'ads', 'Not', 'great', 'idea', 'Dowdle', 'much', 'less', 'well-known', 'first', 'few', 'films', 'showed', 'great', 'deal', 'promise', 'first', 'big', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'Quarantine', 'one', 'few', 'Hollywood', 'horror', 'remakes', ""n't"", 'absolute', 'crap', 'Devil', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'as', 'good', 'Dowdle', 'last', 'original', '2007', 'Poughkeepsie', 'Tapes', 'good', 'enough', 'watch', 'nice', 'see', 'Dowdle', 'doing', 'something', ""n't"", 'gimmicky', 'Poughkeepsie', 'Quarantine', 'entry', 'found-footage', 'subgenre', '.Plot', 'Five', 'people', 'elevator', 'One', 'actually', 'devil', 'temp', 'security', 'guard', 'Riddick', 'Bokeem', 'Woodbine', 'who', 'just', 'started', 'working', 'building', 'morning', 'slick', 'salesman', 'Super', 'Troopers', 'Geofrrey', 'Arend', 'slimy', 'guy', 'everyone', 'else', 'elevator', 'immediately', 'hate', 'acerbic', 'old', 'lady', 'Mystic', 'River', 'Jenny', ""O'Hara"", 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'nice', 'word', 'anyone', 'order', 'magnitude', 'more', 'abusive', 'elevator', 'stuck', 'fashionista', 'Drag', 'Me', 'Hell', 'Bojana', 'Novikovic', 'who', 'act', 'mediator', 'explosive', 'personalities', 'guy', 'see', 'beginning', 'movie', 'lurking', 'front', 'door', 'looking', 'suspicious', 'hoodie', 'Prometheus', 'Logan', 'Marshall-Green', 'going', 'pair', 'cops', 'Argo', 'Chris', 'Messina', 'Pacific', 'Rim', 'Josh', 'Peace', 'are', 'investigating', 'suicide', 'earlier', 'day', 'same', 'building', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'tie', 'two', 'security', 'guards', 'Crimson', 'Tide', 'Matt', 'Craven', 'Death', 'Race', 'Jacob', 'Vargas', 'are', 'trying', 'can', 'get', 'elevator', 'running', '8220', 'OH', 'WTF', '8221', 'plot', 'twist', 'end', 'can', 'be', 'spotted', 'mile', 'away', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'know', 'coming', 'moment', 'set', 'up', 'did', 'letdown', 'subplot', 'film', 'honestly', 'can', 'probably', 'ignore', ""'re"", 'not', 'here', 'subplots', 'anyway', 'cheesiness', 'well', 'worthy', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', ""'re"", 'here', 'devil', 'elevator', 'respect', 'Dowdle', '8220', 'who', 'who', '8221', 'angle', 'handled', 'deft', 'enough', 'touch', 'should', 'be', 'kept', 'enough', 'dark', 'be', 'able', 'enjoy', 'what', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'even', 'groans', 'when', 'pieces', 'are', 'put', 'together', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'judicious', 'editing', 'what', 'got', 'watchable', 'enough', '**']",N/A

The thing with Shyamalan films is that he can tell a good story, but his characters and character development are usually lackluster.Devil, although a good story, suffers heavily because of the characters. Not only was the acting poor (I venture to say it was worse than Mark Wahlberg's performance in The Happening.) But the dialogue and character development were pitiful. At times I had to cringe at what was being said because it was just so...corny. And worst of all, the lack of character development didn't have me caring one bit about any of the characters in the elevator or outside of it. This is really disappointing because had Shyamalan spent a bit more time developing the characters and making the dialogue believable, this movie could have easily been a true survival horror classic.Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy watching the film. It brought back good memories of when Shyamalan was king of the surprise endings.

Yes...I said ""re-do"" as opposed to ""re-make"". A re-make is when a director takes an older film, sometimes even a classic, and makes it better. A re-do is when a director takes a film and adds nothing to the original (and in most cases makes it worse). The 2008 version of Quarantine was clearly just a re-do. So I had little hope that Dowdle's next big project would be anything better than average. But I was wrong.Devil had been way down on my movie queue list since it came out, but I should have watched it when it hit the DVD shelves back in December 2010. Here it is 7 months later and I can think of a few movies that I've watched since the beginning of the year that would have been time better spent watching this.Devil succeeds almost everywhere that I thought it would go wrong. I should have paid more attention to the old axiom ""don't judge a book (movie) by its cover"" before finally watching this movie. The promos showed  some folks stuck in an elevator seemingly haunted by some kind of presence. That to me looked and sounded pretty unexciting. But as I said, I do indeed stand corrected.Redemption for Director Dowdle. He took a few little know TV actors and a couple of familiar character actors and made a great suspense film...and best of all he did it in less than 90 minutes. He got believable performances from his cast, and he never lets the viewer get bored.Speaking of redemption, Devil Co-writer M. Night Shyamalan should have directed this one himself, because his last 4 directorial efforts sure were flops. Oh well, at least it shows the guy can still spin a good tale.Check Devil out if you're into the Suspense genre (with a bit of Horror thrown in).

1371492,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B003Y5H4SO,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[1, 3]","A great hook - an elevator breaks down with five strangers stranded inside, one of whom may be the devil incarnate - and a movie that proceeds to live up to the potential of that hook makes ""Devil"" a can't-miss for fans of horror and supernatural mystery.  Starting off with a police investigation of an unsolved suicide before swinging into the elevator plot, the movie actually weaves several different angles and subplots into its main devil/elevator hook, making for an extremely potent whole.The efforts of the building's maintenance crew and security team to get a stuck elevator moving again become a lot more pressing after the first of several temporary blackouts on the elevator (the inside of the elevator can be observed through a security camera).  During these early blackouts, things start happening on the elevator, that neither the passengers nor the security team nor the viewer can initially see.  It quickly becomes apparant that there's a potential for violence in this confined space and the police are called in, though few observers in the building's security room really suspect how dire the situation is.  The film splits its time between the elevator and the happenings on the outside about evenly, and unfolds at a fast, energetic pace.There appear to be secrets to each of the passengers in the elevator that may or may not tie in to the main events.  There's a potential shortcoming, admittedly, that I guess should be addressed, and why I don't feel it really hurt the overall movie.  But it only becomes evident quite a ways in, so I'll put my usual disclaimer over it:****WARNING: POSSIBLE SEMI-SPOILERS AHEAD****If, as it seems, the devil has come to Earth to harvest humans, this arguement could be used: Yes, the characters all have some flaw or dark part of their past, but are all of them really That bad, as in Devil-come-up-from-Hell-and-grab-'em bad?  Why I don't feel that this hurts the movie too much: for starters, the devil isn't likely to be a forgiving fellow.  Besides which, although stories like this often have the devil/demons bound by some kind of rules when they make it to Earth, why does that neccesarily have to be the case every time?  Also, the movie wouldn't work if you had the elevator populated solely by characters you'd want to see dragged down to Hell.  It had to have each character have something potentially sympathetic/likable (at least at the start), and to have each character have something potentially unlikable.  It did a good job in this.  As to the ultimate fate of each character's soul if and when the devil does 'em in, a lot of that's left to the individual viewer's imagination and interpretation.****END SEMI-SPOILERS SECTION****The movie puts a lot into its relatively short running time (81 minutes), resulting in a quick, constantly engaging dynamic.  The performances, musical score, and overall production all get high points, and ""Devil"" grabs you right at the opening credits and doesn't let go.

He likes to play games, letting others see it, making certain that things play out his way. There are other rules, too, and those rules are left like breadcrumbs through the movie. Still, the reality of it is that a group of people end up in an elevator and something starts happening. There are oddities on the visual, people doing strange things, touching when it shouldn't happen, criminal acts coming to the front, and wonder who is doing it all. The bodies stack up, the people freak out, and watchers try to understand just what is happening.Spooky.I was REALLY relucant to watch this because movies like Lady in the Water have burned me badly. So have things about communities, things about aliens, and other notions tha came from M.Night's mind. The one thing he seemed to get right in this movie was the fact that he didn't do all the jobs that were available and, as such, he got it all going.It was a help and more.As far as the set goes, I thought the building and the elevator worked. The confined space and the lights going out were really something horrible when you think about it. Even thinking you might be trapped like that would be terrible enough. Now you add in some little things on the side of the monsterous as well and you have something that is starting to roll forward. you have a nice place to kill and you have a set that makes men seem like sheep as they cower and try to understand why.The actors were good, too, but I would have liked one thing out. The story is told by someone fearing the devil and, really, it felt like the Catholic church was in their giving me lessons. I wouldn't have minded him being there to help us along, either, but he kept telling the viewers aobut what might come for the people. I get it is the big baddy, too, but the guy just couldn't leave it and let it soak in.Even people around him got really tired of his Grandma's passed down knowing.The mopvie had a fair turn of scares and I did like it. i found the ending to be matter of convience, but a matter like that can be ignored when watching something like this. I know a lot of people did not like this, either, and maybe you would be one of those. I say that you throw out your expectations and think B-movie.

Just before this accident happens, someone apparently jumped off from the same building and died. A police detective Bowden (Chris Messina) with a tragic past is sent to the scene to discover that there is some mysterious power at work behind the two seemingly unrelated incidents.The film's original story is written by M. Night Shyamalan, which is later developed by Brian Nelson, writer of a thriller ""Hard Candy"" starring Ellen Page. Being the first part of ""The Night Chronicles,"" ""Devil"" is less a straightforward horror movie than an Agatha Christie-esque occult mystery. With Tak Fujimoto's moody photography and the effective score of Fernando Vel&aacute;zquez (""The Orphanage""), ""Devil"" is atmospheric, if not very scary.What disappointed me is not Shyamalan's concept, which I think is not as interesting as other reviewers, but still has potential for a solid thriller or suspense. But it seems directors John Erick Dowdle and Drew Dowdle (""Quarantine"") are so busy with the film's visual aspects (which are respectable, I admit) that they forget to provide convincing back story for each character, something that plays the central role in the storyline.In short, with cardboard characters we really don't care, the process of finding out ""why them"" is not that interesting in ""Devil."" As to ""what happens and how,"" we know who is to blame, and in case you have forgotten the film's title, a security guard steps in and explains everything ... well, not exactly everything, but anyway, by the time the film ends, we don't know why this elaborate setup is needed.",3,"(2.5 STARS) Old Fashioned Thriller: Not Much Logic, Just Atmosphere",1330128000,"02 25, 2012",2012,1652,"['Five', 'strangers', 'are', 'trapped', 'elevator', 'Philadelphia', 'office', 'building', 'Just', 'accident', 'someone', 'apparently', 'jumped', 'off', 'same', 'building', 'died', 'A', 'police', 'detective', 'Bowden', 'Chris', 'Messina', 'tragic', 'past', 'sent', 'scene', 'discover', 'mysterious', 'power', 'work', 'two', 'seemingly', 'unrelated', 'incidents.The', 'film', 'original', 'story', 'written', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'later', 'developed', 'Brian', 'Nelson', 'writer', 'thriller', 'Hard', 'Candy', 'starring', 'Ellen', 'Page', 'Being', 'first', 'part', 'Night', 'Chronicles', 'Devil', 'less', 'straightforward', 'horror', 'movie', 'Agatha', 'Christie-esque', 'occult', 'mystery', 'Tak', 'Fujimoto', 'moody', 'photography', 'effective', 'score', 'Fernando', 'Vel', 'aacute', 'zquez', 'Orphanage', 'Devil', 'atmospheric', 'not', 'very', 'scary.What', 'disappointed', 'not', 'Shyamalan', 'concept', 'think', 'not', 'as', 'interesting', 'other', 'reviewers', 'still', 'potential', 'solid', 'thriller', 'suspense', 'directors', 'John', 'Erick', 'Dowdle', 'Drew', 'Dowdle', 'Quarantine', 'are', 'so', 'busy', 'film', 'visual', 'aspects', 'are', 'respectable', 'admit', 'forget', 'provide', 'convincing', 'back', 'story', 'character', 'something', 'central', 'role', 'storyline.In', 'short', 'cardboard', 'characters', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'process', 'finding', 'out', 'why', 'not', 'interesting', 'Devil', 'what', 'how', 'know', 'who', 'blame', 'case', 'have', 'forgotten', 'film', 'title', 'security', 'guard', 'steps', 'explains', 'everything', 'well', 'not', 'exactly', 'everything', 'anyway', 'time', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'elaborate', 'setup', 'needed']",N/A

Night Shyalmalan. Shyalmalan who has had a career in free fall after a promising start may have found his niche as a producer/story man (he wrote the story the film is based on)allowing others to complete his vision.Unlike the last three films that Shyalmalan has done which became unintentional comedies, ""Devil"" benefits from the confined space of the elevator that the story takes place in. Inspired by the folktale ""The Devil's Meeting"", ""Devil"" works because it eschews the heavy handed symbolism and increasingly lame O. Henry (or Rod Serling)like twist endings that Shyalmalan relied on to tell his stories. Perhaps the film benefited from having someone else direct it and write it which might explain why the excesses that have made Shyalmalan's films virtually unwatchable are absent here. The actors should also be praised here for keeping the film believable.The main flaws with the film are a fairly predictable plot but Nelson introduces a subplot involving our detective that keeps us guessing (even if most viewers will figure it all out by the first third of the movie)and a pat, predictable outcome that lacks the flash that I had opened for at the conclusion.Detective Bowden (Chris Messina)pulls duty on what appears to be a suicide but quickly reveals itself to be something much more. As Bowden investigates the suicide he gets called in to a situation where five people (Jenny O'Hara, Caroline Dhavernas, Bokeem Woodbine,Geoffrey Arend and Logan Marshall-Green) are trapped on the express elevator in the high rise where the jumper made her fatal leap from. The security officer (Matt Craven) in charge and his deeply religious co-worker (Jacob Vargas)watch on their security screens as the five trapped in the elevator are attacked by someone or something in the elevator with them.""Devil"" avoids the trappings that caused Shyalmalan's last three films to fail so badly and that's a good thing. If Shyalmalan can continue this trend with the next films in this series (it's part of a trilogy called ""The Night Chronicles"" about supernatural occurences in modern urban society) he might be able to break the curse dogging his films.The Blu-ray looks quite nice with a detailed image and nice skin textures although I wouldn't call it refernce quality. Audio sounds quite good throughout and since seens happen in darkness with only the audio to spook us, that's a good thing.The special features are meager with three deleted scenes and a 7 minutes of featurettes that is little more than an electronic press kit presentation. It's a pity a little more wasn't provided here--a commentary track from the writer or director would have been welcome.Proving that the Devil IS in the details when it comes to supernatural thrillers, ""Devil"" provides us with 80 minutes of entertainment improving on other films that Shyalmalan has been involved with over the past decade. Although the ending and resolution are a bit too pat (a flaw of ALL of the films that Shyalmalan has been involved in), ""Devil"" proves that the road to Hell IS paved with BAD intentions for our five passengers trapped in an elevator and the detective trying to save them and that the road bumpier the road, the more entertaining the outcome.",4,M.

This is the first of several ""Night Chronicles.""  It turns out to be generally good, although not quite what I was expecting.  As can be gleaned from the trailer, it's about 5 people trapped in a skyscraper elevator (the inside kind).  One of them may be a killer, or even something evil.  Although the trailer didn't reveal too much, I expected the story to involve the early revelation of a demonic figure, and a lot more gore than there was.  Instead, it's much more about the suspense of not knowing who the killer is and what will happen next.  This film is pretty subtle, at times almost too subtle.  By that I mean the scariness factor might have been upped by just a few more flashes of the demonic as events unfolded.  There were also a couple of disconnects or logical fallacies here and there, such as how the characters didn't figure out a source of light until much later than they should have (during the lights-out moments in the elevator), and the guy falling out of the skyscraper at the beginning was never really explained.

1371511,A12LKEM543ILBK,B003Y5H4SO,zombie phreak,"[2, 3]","This movie takes 5 strangers and throws them together in an elevator, but one of them is Satan.  The police can see and talk to them through a security camera, but the mic on the camera is broken so they can't hear them.One by one the people in the elevator are killed by mysterious circumstances, and everyone suspects everyone else.  All the passengers have something in their past that damns them.  One is a thug who beats people and has a long rap sheet of offenses.  One is a gold-digging woman who marries men, divorces them and takes their money.  Another is a thief and a con artist.  One is a soldier from Afghanistan (I could be wrong on this one), who has killed people in war time but also killed the police man's (who is watching them)family in a car accident years ago and got away with it.The suspense is awesome, and the story really keeps you on your toes all the time.  It also preys on the fears that we all have of unexplainable evil and what we would do if we came face to face with that evil.  And what do you do when part of that evil is part of you, no matter what little lies you tell yourself to cover it up?It's pretty good and I do recommend it.",4,Great Thriller!,1310688000,"07 15, 2011",2011,1173,"['movie', '5', 'strangers', 'together', 'elevator', 'one', 'Satan', 'police', 'can', 'see', 'talk', 'security', 'camera', 'mic', 'camera', 'broken', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hear', 'them.One', 'one', 'people', 'elevator', 'are', 'killed', 'mysterious', 'circumstances', 'everyone', 'everyone', 'else', 'passengers', 'have', 'something', 'past', 'One', 'thug', 'who', 'people', 'long', 'rap', 'sheet', 'offenses', 'One', 'gold-digging', 'woman', 'who', 'men', 'divorces', 'money', 'thief', 'con', 'artist', 'One', 'soldier', 'Afghanistan', 'could', 'be', 'wrong', 'one', 'who', 'killed', 'people', 'war', 'time', 'also', 'killed', 'police', 'man', 'who', 'watching', 'family', 'car', 'accident', 'years', 'ago', 'got', 'away', 'it.The', 'suspense', 'awesome', 'story', 'really', 'toes', 'time', 'also', 'fears', 'have', 'unexplainable', 'evil', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'came', 'face', 'face', 'evil', 'what', 'do', 'do', 'when', 'part', 'evil', 'part', 'matter', 'what', 'little', 'tell', 'cover', 'up', 'pretty', 'good', 'do', 'recommend']",N/A
