Luster ""The Rook""","[13, 14]","If you believe that man should try to live in harmony with nature or you enjoyed Dan Haggerty's TV series ""Grizzley Adams"" or his movies you should definitely catch this one. Very entertaining movie about a surveyor in the old west. It give us a glimpse of living in the wild with nature and animals, French boatmen, river pirates, native americans, and wilderness settlements. Personally I love the things that Haggerty and the people making his movies try to convey. They try to educate us about another time but also that good ideas never die. I was also glad to see Don Shanks again. Here he plays Running Wolf, and although him and Haggerty's character don't see eye to eye, they respect each other. Don is a fine actor and not given enough roles as far as I'm concerned. Good quality DVD with good replayability.",4,Spirit of the Eagle,1206921600,"03 31, 2008",2008,818,"['believe', 'man', 'should', 'try', 'live', 'harmony', 'nature', 'enjoyed', 'Dan', 'Haggerty', 'TV', 'series', 'Grizzley', 'Adams', 'movies', 'should', 'definitely', 'catch', 'one', 'Very', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'surveyor', 'old', 'west', 'give', 'glimpse', 'living', 'wild', 'nature', 'animals', 'French', 'boatmen', 'river', 'pirates', 'native', 'americans', 'wilderness', 'settlements', 'Personally', 'love', 'things', 'Haggerty', 'people', 'making', 'movies', 'try', 'convey', 'try', 'educate', 'time', 'also', 'good', 'ideas', 'never', 'die', 'was', 'also', 'glad', 'see', 'Don', 'Shanks', 'again', 'Here', 'Running', 'Wolf', 'Haggerty', 'character', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'eye', 'eye', 'respect', 'other', 'Don', 'fine', 'actor', 'not', 'given', 'enough', 'roles', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'Good', 'quality', 'DVD', 'good', 'replayability']",N/A
