E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Dirty Little Trick stars the attractive Christie Burson playing the role of a hitchhiker who dresses up and scams people (older men) out of money and sets them up to appear guilty for a crime they didn't commit, using her sophisticated charm and sex.  Sounds appealing doesn't it?  Oh yeah, it is, mainly because Christie is incredibly hot.She's apparently capable of intelligently and connivingly screwing men (sometimes literally) out of thousands of dollars using elaborate schemes (or maybe all the pieces happen to fall into place for her quite often, who really knows).  She often dresses up in wigs and changes her appearance when she encounters *other* men as a means to go undetected (the bank or hotel room is where the setting usually takes place).  This can admittedly be quite the confusing plotline!  That's why it's important to pay as much attention to it as possible.  I love how she wins over mens trust only to end up using them later on by leaving them in the dust.  What a gal!Dean Cain is fantastic in his role as the clueless nice guy that doesn't know what's going on whenever the cops pay him a visit with lots of questions and accusations, which is appealing.  And wow, does Dean STILL look remarkably young or what?  Great actor.  Love his performance here.  You have to have good characters to present a compelling storyline, so solid job by the writers there.Of course this is basically a cheesy action flick but the storyline is decent and fairly original enough that I can't help but enjoy it.  Some of the violence near the end is quite bloody and graphic which is surprising.  Oh and the ending is INCREDIBLY unpredictable.  Who would have ever seen *that* coming?  It happens completely out of nowhere too.  Actually I'm referring to two different parts (the scene at the VERY end is surprising too).  A short, well-written, enticing drama with just enough suspense to keep me happy.On a final note, perhaps I'm a tad disappointed since I felt that, by reading the description at least, the story would be about a wild ride through the desert involving a hitchhiker, but the truth is, I was only assuming the storyline would go in this direction.  I was wrong but, who cares.

I enjoyed it very much.It is clearly not a high budget movie, so do not expect lavish sets or super expensive stunts.

1461432,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B005HWAODE,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[1, 1]","Sarah (Christie Burson) is young, provocative, spontaneous, and unpredictable. She is every man's dream and nightmare rolled up into one. She captures our imagination from her very first scene as she is hitchhiking. She reminded me of Melanie Griffith in ""Something Wild"" only not as tame. The picture has a quirky Tarantino influence. I loved the black widow tattoo on Sarah's back. That added to much to her personality.Sarah is not a nice person. She is all about money. The film shows us the present situation of Sarah with Michael (Dean Cain) then gives us flashbacks of her dirty little trick involving Danny (Joe Jones) who works for Vito (Michael Madsen). Characters who are introduced as seemingly minor, come back with importance and a connection.

1461433,A1XT8AJB7S9JJG,B005HWAODE,Tony Heck,"[1, 3]","""Once you go down this road there ain't no coming back."" Michael (Cain) is driving home when he sees the beautiful Sarah (Burson) hitchhiking. He stops to pick her up and his life is thrown into chaos. I have to start by saying that this is not an amazing movie at all. It's not even technically a good movie, but it is an entertaining movie. There have been a few movies recently (Take Me Home Tonight is the main example) that have tried to have the feel of a movie set in the 80's. Most come off as trying too hard. I don't know if this movie was trying or not but it definitely had the feel of a very cheesy low budget 80's movie. The effects were bad and even the plot seemed to be a throw back. If you judge the movie based on effects and acting this is terrible. If you judge it based on entertainment and watch-ability it's not that bad. There are much worse ways to spend 90 minutes of your life. Overall, not good at all, but it is entertaining. I give it a B-.",3,A movie with the feel of a cheesy 80's action movie.
