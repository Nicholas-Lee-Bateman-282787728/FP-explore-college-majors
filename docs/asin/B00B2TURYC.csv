1621337,A3CW0ZLUO5X2B1,B00B2TURYC,"35-year Technology Consumer ""8-tracks to 802.11""","[0, 0]","""Room 514"" is an artfully crafted movie. Using only a handful of actors and dominated by the claustrophobic confines of the title interrogation room, it lays out the story of Anna, an underdog Israeli army investigator. Anna is a conscripted military investigator seeking insight into events that take place beyond far beyond her span of control (an operational unit in the Israeli/Occupied territories, and persons of interest that increase in rank --and their commitment to the military as a career) as she defies logical processes that might convince her to just let go.Viewers without some familiarity with the Israeli military (and its mostly compulsory military service) and the political climate of the Levant will be challenged to take away much from this movie. This is not the movie's fault, since it's Israeli made (in Hebrew with English subtitles). Beyond that, even with the sparest of sets and actors, familiar military movie tropes abound:-conscript vs. careerist-enlisted vs. officer-junior investigator vs. senior accused-forward operational issues vs. rear echelon regulation.Anna reveals multiple issues during the course of her face to face and telephonic issues: mommy issues, male/daddy issues, issues with authority. An extended --and I would argue, gratuitous, even with both participants fully clothed-- ""tryst"" with her lover in the interrogation room does little to advance the story, while doing plenty to prompt questions about Anna's ultimate regard for the institution she is professing to serve with the truth.In the end, I found the craft of this movie to overwhelm its narrative, and wished we could have had at least as much information as Anna did as each conversant appeared. Between the lack of context and the jarring, single-room venue that dominates, this movie takes a lot of work to absorb.Is this movie worth renting and the time it takes to watch it? Absolutely. But if you've entered it with high expectations based on critical acclaim from film festival buzz, you might want to temper those.Note: Film Movement provided a copy of this movie for review.",3,The conceit of its small setting overpowers a potentially compelling story...,1371340800,"06 16, 2013",2013,2100,"['Room', '514', 'artfully', 'crafted', 'movie', 'Using', 'only', 'handful', 'actors', 'dominated', 'claustrophobic', 'confines', 'title', 'interrogation', 'room', 'out', 'story', 'Anna', 'underdog', 'Israeli', 'army', 'investigator', 'Anna', 'conscripted', 'military', 'investigator', 'seeking', 'insight', 'events', 'take', 'place', 'far', 'span', 'control', 'operational', 'unit', 'Israeli/Occupied', 'territories', 'persons', 'interest', 'increase', 'rank', 'commitment', 'military', 'career', 'logical', 'processes', 'might', 'convince', 'just', 'let', 'go.Viewers', 'familiarity', 'Israeli', 'military', 'mostly', 'compulsory', 'military', 'service', 'political', 'climate', 'Levant', 'will', 'be', 'challenged', 'take', 'away', 'much', 'movie', 'not', 'movie', 'fault', 'Israeli', 'made', 'Hebrew', 'English', 'subtitles', 'Beyond', 'even', 'sparest', 'sets', 'actors', 'familiar', 'military', 'movie', 'tropes', '-conscript', 'careerist-enlisted', 'vs.', 'officer-junior', 'investigator', 'vs.', 'senior', 'accused-forward', 'operational', 'issues', 'vs.', 'rear', 'echelon', 'regulation.Anna', 'multiple', 'issues', 'course', 'face', 'face', 'telephonic', 'issues', 'mommy', 'issues', 'male/daddy', 'issues', 'issues', 'authority', 'extended', 'would', 'argue', 'gratuitous', 'even', 'participants', 'fully', 'clothed', 'tryst', 'lover', 'interrogation', 'room', 'little', 'advance', 'story', 'doing', 'plenty', 'prompt', 'questions', 'Anna', 'ultimate', 'regard', 'institution', 'professing', 'serve', 'truth.In', 'end', 'found', 'craft', 'movie', 'overwhelm', 'narrative', 'wished', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'least', 'as', 'much', 'information', 'Anna', 'did', 'conversant', 'appeared', 'lack', 'context', 'jarring', 'single-room', 'venue', 'movie', 'lot', 'work', 'absorb.Is', 'movie', 'renting', 'time', 'watch', 'Absolutely', ""'ve"", 'entered', 'high', 'expectations', 'based', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'film', 'festival', 'buzz', 'might', 'want', 'temper', 'those.Note', 'Film', 'Movement', 'provided', 'copy', 'movie', 'review']",Room 514

1621339,A1S3C5OFU508P3,B00B2TURYC,Charles Ashbacher,"[0, 0]","The premise of this movie is a powerful one, Anna is a female investigator in the Israeli military and she is ordered to investigate an allegation that an officer physically abused an Arab family while he was stationed in the occupied territories. When confronted by Anna, the officer mocks her, calling her nave and stating that she has no idea how difficult it is to protect her and those around her from the terrorist threats. The soldier that reported the abuse is called a snitch and a rat and his fellow soldiers start a campaign of petty harassment, such as scrawling his name on the bathroom walls. Anna is told by her superior officer to reduce the level of her zeal, but her idealism continues to drive her to the point where her conclusion of abuse attracts the attention of the Major General.The premise is an encapsulation of the internal conflicts of Israeli society over the continued occupation of the Arab territories in the West Bank. Over forty years of occupation have strained the Army and the people within it and there are strong forces in the Israeli military that try to suppress any reporting of abuses committed by the Israeli military. This pressure extends to the American political structure, where small, honest statements about Israeli errors made by American political figures are vilified by the American right wing.Unfortunately, this powerful premise is weakened by a plot that often moves far too slow, it is as if the director is desperate to fill the time. For example, the number in the title refers to the room that Anna uses for her interrogations (and sexual flings) and the location shots of the number on the door take far too long. Anna's times of anguish, where she holds her head in her hands are overshot to the point of boredom. The worst scene is when Anna puts a tape in a player and music with dialog is added to her scene of anguish. Yet, the dialog is not translated, so the non-Hebrew speaker is at a loss to understand what is being said and the significance that it may have.Finally, I found the sex scenes to be of dubious value in the furtherance of the plot. The premise is such a powerful one in modern Israeli society that the titillating aspects of Anna having sexual encounters in room 514 could have been left out and replaced by more coverage of the consequences of the exposure of Israeli abuse of Arabs. The most interesting segment is the last ten minutes or so where there is a battle of wills over the consequences of Anna's investigation and the conclusions.",3,At times it moves too slow and it would have been better if the sex scenes were replaced by more debate,1372550400,"06 30, 2013",2013,2531,"['premise', 'movie', 'powerful', 'one', 'Anna', 'female', 'investigator', 'Israeli', 'military', 'ordered', 'investigate', 'allegation', 'officer', 'physically', 'abused', 'Arab', 'family', 'was', 'stationed', 'occupied', 'territories', 'When', 'confronted', 'Anna', 'officer', 'calling', 'nave', 'stating', 'idea', 'how', 'difficult', 'protect', 'terrorist', 'threats', 'soldier', 'reported', 'abuse', 'called', 'snitch', 'rat', 'fellow', 'soldiers', 'start', 'campaign', 'petty', 'harassment', 'such', 'scrawling', 'name', 'bathroom', 'walls', 'Anna', 'told', 'superior', 'officer', 'reduce', 'level', 'zeal', 'idealism', 'drive', 'point', 'where', 'conclusion', 'abuse', 'attention', 'Major', 'General.The', 'premise', 'encapsulation', 'internal', 'conflicts', 'Israeli', 'society', 'continued', 'occupation', 'Arab', 'territories', 'West', 'Bank', 'forty', 'years', 'occupation', 'have', 'strained', 'Army', 'people', 'are', 'strong', 'forces', 'Israeli', 'military', 'try', 'suppress', 'reporting', 'abuses', 'committed', 'Israeli', 'military', 'pressure', 'American', 'political', 'structure', 'where', 'small', 'honest', 'statements', 'Israeli', 'errors', 'made', 'American', 'political', 'figures', 'are', 'vilified', 'American', 'right', 'wing.Unfortunately', 'powerful', 'premise', 'weakened', 'plot', 'often', 'far', 'too', 'slow', 'director', 'desperate', 'fill', 'time', 'example', 'number', 'title', 'refers', 'room', 'Anna', 'interrogations', 'sexual', 'flings', 'location', 'shots', 'number', 'door', 'take', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'Anna', 'times', 'anguish', 'where', 'head', 'hands', 'are', 'overshot', 'point', 'boredom', 'worst', 'scene', 'when', 'Anna', 'tape', 'player', 'music', 'dialog', 'added', 'scene', 'anguish', 'dialog', 'not', 'translated', 'non-Hebrew', 'speaker', 'loss', 'understand', 'what', 'being', 'said', 'significance', 'may', 'have.Finally', 'found', 'sex', 'scenes', 'be', 'dubious', 'value', 'furtherance', 'plot', 'premise', 'such', 'powerful', 'one', 'modern', 'Israeli', 'society', 'titillating', 'aspects', 'Anna', 'having', 'sexual', 'encounters', 'room', '514', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'out', 'replaced', 'more', 'coverage', 'consequences', 'exposure', 'Israeli', 'abuse', 'Arabs', 'most', 'interesting', 'segment', 'last', 'ten', 'minutes', 'so', 'where', 'battle', 'wills', 'consequences', 'Anna', 'investigation', 'conclusions']",Room 514
1621340,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B00B2TURYC,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[0, 0]","Room 514 is one of the most carefully constructed perfect films I have seen in a long time. Although the film appears to be put together in a simple linear fashion, in fact the director has carefully crafted every camera movement, use of framing, absence or presence of color, spoken dialog, actor's movements, and pacing.The film opens with a close up of an officer sitting on the floor; they reach up and take a yellow note of the table, slowly open the note, and then the camera moves back to reveal this is a female military officer (eventually it is revealed she is a military police officer). That opening is so critical in the film; it is repeated exactly twelve minutes before the end of the film. That scene is then taken to a different place for the closure of the film.This is an amazing story. The film takes place in three locations, interrogation room 514, a bus, and around a sink. Normally this would create a claustrophobic film, the interrogation room is miniscule. In the bus, Anna is always framed tightly and the camera is bolted down solidly to the bus frame - there is absolutely no camera movement, in stark contrast to the interrogation room where the camera is handheld. The sink scenes are always in black and white and handheld. Instead of creating claustrophobia, the film opens incredibly wide, painting an incredibly vivid view of what happens outside those walls. In a way, those scenes are more powerful because I had to imagine them, much like reading a book. This small number of sets was also homage to older films that were adaptations of theater production - Death of a Salesman, Marty, and Rear Window all come to mind.What I loved about this film, every single action had meaning. One step was built upon another. I noticed the small intimate things the director did. It isn't necessary to watch this film closely to be in the moment and follow the story. Those subtle film techniques are the things most people experience and have no idea why a film is so powerful. I was reminded of the incredible care with which the story was built in films like S&uuml;gisball (Autumn Ball) (2009) and Memento. These films are difficult to watch and take a lot of concentration to follow. Room 514, on the other hand, flows along seamlessly but close viewing is rewarded. This film is subtle using suggestion as opposed to the others that are much more overt with the imagery.This is Sharon Bar-Ziv's first film as a director. If he continues to make masterpieces like this, he has an incredible career ahead of him. Oddly, in homage to Alfred Hitchcock, Bar-Ziv ends up in this film as a random man sitting next to Anna on the bus. It seems even the minor random things in this film have meaning or are deliberate. The cast was absolutely amazing. The star, Asia Neifeld as Anna is incredibly beautiful, powerful, and confident. She is so perfect in this film. With only two other films to her credit, I'm amazed.This film is not rated. It is presented in Hebrew with English subtitles that can be turned off. This is a difficult film to rate or give an appropriate age group. There is no nudity. There is no violence. There are a few moments of strong language in the subtitles (the MPAA would probably throw an R rating for the count on the language, but it isn't offensive use). There is absolutely no drug use or mention of drinking. There is infidelity mentioned. All signs would say, younger viewers no problem. I would probably reserve this film for more mature younger viewers. There is one of the most erotic sexually charged scenes of two people making love that I have ever seen in a film, nobody has their clothes off - there is no nudity. This scene is intense. If this couple was not really making love in this scene, Asia Neifeld deserves an academy award for the realism and intensity she showed during this scene.I've said very little about the plot of this film. Most any discussion of the plot would likely ruin this fantastic film. The discovery process is so important, that I wouldn't want to ruin it for anybody. The whole idea of the Israeli / Arab conflict is a pretext for the film. It does not get lost in politics. Instead this is an incredible deep view into Anna. I am so happy I spent a fabulous hour and a half with her.The short film included on the DVD is another case of something I didn't care for. Film Movement has a lot of trouble finding really good compelling shorts to accompany their main masterpieces. Sometimes they knock it out of the ball park and find some incredible hidden treasure. Other times the 15 minute short couldn't end fast enough for me. I hated every single character in the film. I didn't care one bit what happened to anybody. I felt bludgeoned by the message the director was trying to hammer home. It was a waste of time after watching the incredible Room 514.I love the Film Movement series. They present titles I would never choose off the shelf. I've trusted their main film choice so many times and have been richly rewarded with incredible films. It is the rare time when they disappoint. Room 514 is right up there at the top of the best films they have chosen.I was provided a copy for review.MementoS&uuml;gisball (Autumn Ball)",5,A Masterpiece,1369785600,"05 29,

Written and directed with great sophistication by Sharon Bar-Ziv and acted by a very small cast of splendid actors, this is a cinematic experience that shake's the viewer and makes an indelible impression of the many conflicts facing not only the Israelis of the story but of all peoples of global significance.Anna (Asia Naifeld), whose origins are Russian, is in the Israeli army and is assigned the duty of investigating military/civilian incidents. Her current investigation involves interrogating Nimrod (Guy Kapulnik), an officer who is suspected of having information about a group of Israeli soldiers who brutally beat and unarmed Arab family. Nimrod is sarcastic about Anna's abilities, saying she doesn't understand warfare: his accusations are punctuated with frequent cellphone calls Anna accepts from her mother about household matters. Anna is in an affair with a fellow soldier Eraz (Ohad Hall) who is engaged to be married, but that doesn't stop their have very steamy sexual encounters in the interrogation room (there is one of the most erotic, complete sex scenes in film and all of this is by suggestion only as clothing is present). Eraz wants Anna to stop the interrogation of Nimrod because no killing was done. At the same time Eraz wants Anna to lie about their affair when his fianc&eacute; Michaeli (Hilly Israel) confronts him.  Anna acquiesces to Eraz demands but pursues Nimrod until Nimrod agrees to bring in his commanding officer Davidi (Udi Persi) who apparently was the perpetrator of the beating incident. The results of Anna's interrogation provide her with the sense of justice that she has won for the victims of the beating, but that successful interrogation brings about a surprise ending to this film that is almost unbearably heartbreaking. While the underlying theme seems bound to Israeli versus Arabs, the issues explored are applicable worldwide - when is the abuse of power justified, what is the difference between covering for an act of adultery and covering for an act of military violence against innocent citizens?This is an eye-opening view of the Israeli military and the very human problems that exist, but more importantly it is an under the microscope examination of human motivation. The cast is brilliant. Apparently the film was rehearsed for six months and then shot (in perfect cinematographic technique) in 5 days! In a word, it is brilliant!

1621342,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00B2TURYC,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","The Israeli drama ""Room 514"" can be described as a claustrophobic chamber piece that examines some fairly universal topics despite its relatively confined settings. It's a small picture that packs a big punch. Almost all of the film's action is confined to a spare room, there are rarely more than two characters on screen at the same time, and the movie relies on an intimacy in its interactions that make the viewer feel almost like a voyeur (a fly on the wall, if you will). While many of these choices may have been dictated by the movie's budget, they are elements that help to make ""Room 514"" feel decidedly different. There is nothing particularly new about he topics that the screenplay raises, but the story is allowed to unfold organically without hitting you with overt politics or moral pronouncements. In the end, though, filmmaker Sharon Bar-Ziv wrestles with the weighty issues inherent in any territory divided by strife. When is force justifiable? When is it considered excessive?These are the questions that must be addressed by the movie's protagonist Anna (an effective Asia Naifeld), a military investigator looking into a charge of unprovoked aggression. Room 514 is an interrogation room used by the Israeli military. As the story opens, Anna is unraveling just what happened to an Arab family at the hands of a decorated and respected Israeli soldier. The narrative structure of the piece is somewhat fragmented and we only get little parts of the story doled out at a time. This heightens the suspense and mystery as you're not entirely sure where the plot is headed. I liked how all of the opening sequences had Anna stuck in a room alone with the men currently in her life: her reluctant witness, the defiant suspect, and the co-worker whom she's having an affair with. Each interaction gives us a different side of Anna as a character. As more is uncovered, though, we settle into somewhat familiar and expected terrain. Somehow I thought the revelations would be bigger, more unsettling, even controversial. Once the unknown is taken out of the equation, ""Room 514"" becomes a debate on ethics, humanity, responsibility, and morality in conflict.While I absolutely loved the first half of ""Room 514,"" it becomes a little less enigmatic and suprising the more we find out. Still, the movie is well cast and exceedingly well acted. I particularly thought that Udi Persi brought fire and conviction to the role of the accused. ""Room 514"" revisits some serious questions, ethical dilemmas that have been around almost as long as mankind itself. It is thoughtful, without being preachy. And it doesn't shy away from the moral ambiguity inherent in similar situations throughout the world. You are left to decide where you stand, who you side with, and that's as it should be. It's not all black and white in ""Room 514,"" but somewhere in between. The Bonus Short Film included this month is the 16 minute ""The Promised Land"" by Vanessa Knutsen. This feature is set in Israel where an illegal immigrant faces some difficult decisions about what's best for her son. It's a potent topic served up by a good cast. Due to its brevity, the subject can only be developed so far. Expanded, this might have been a devastating story. As is, though, it's an interesting glimpse. Overall, a good release from Film Movement. ""Room 514"" is a very small film that deserves to be seen by a wider audience.

A young female interrogator is grilling some battle-hardened veterans about an operation that has occurred in occupied territory.

Lerch,"[0, 0]","Room 514 is an artful look at the Israeli army, the methods they use and the reasoning, but also a look at the ""art"" of interrogation.What surprised me at first was the sparseness of the sets and locations. The sets consist of the interrogation room, Room 514, the bus and the bathroom. The only location that has any meaning is Room 514.Anna is investigating the beating of innocent Palestinians, by a highly decorated officer (Nimrod). Nimrod is accused by one of his fellow brigade members of overstepping his bounds. When push comes to shove, the truth is revealed, but just how much truth is there to be acted upon?Video:The DVD contains a very good variable bit rate encode and there are no authoring issues. Everything is as crisp and clear as you expect from a DVD.Audio:Dolby Digital 2.0 audio. Being an art house film, it is presented only in its original language of Hebrew. The audio is nothing spectacular, given it is a dialog driven drama and there are no audio problems to be heard.It's not an action film, so stereo is the perfect delivery mechanism.Extras:Also included is a 15 minute short film call Promised Land. This is a short look at a woman on the run from Immigration. If she is caught, she will be deported from Israel. It's not a bad short film, and as with all the Film Movement films I've had the pleasure of viewing, it's well done and fits the theme of the DVD it is included on. On its own, it's not overly note worthy, but as a part of the package, a true extra, it is very good.There is also a Sharon Bar-Ziv biography (text, no video) that is rather short. There is a Room 514 trailer and trailers for other Film Movement films.Over all:Room 514 is a thought provoking look at the Israeli army of today, vs the Israeli army of the past. The lines between good and evil are truly blurred, where soldiers believe they are doing the right thing and superiors turn a blind eye.My biggest gripe with the film is the cinematography itself. The camera, in all but the bus shots, is hand held. On one hand, this voyeuristic approach, as if I'm standing over the ""criminal"" shoulder, really gets you into the actors' personal space. You are part of what is unfolding. The problem I have is actually a personal one. With the shaky camera, the very nature of hand held filmography, I tend to feel sick. The film uses the approach to pull the viewer in, I realize that, but for me, it was nauseating enough that I needed to look away from time to time to keep my bearings. To its credit though, even this nauseating feeling couldn't keep me from falling into the story and being completely engrossed in the tale.The one question that I'm left hanging with is... what was in that letter? And that's the beauty of the film (and many art house films in general). They don't dumb things down for the viewer and allow you to form your own opinions, your own ideas and concepts of just what it all means.Recommended.Of note, I received a free copy of this film for review purposes. I review everything I receive as if I've paid for it, and would gladly have paid Amazon's asking price had I known how much I would have enjoyed it.",5,"Crime, Punishment and Interrogation",1369958400,"05 31, 2013",2013,3148,"['Room', '514', 'artful', 'look', 'Israeli', 'army', 'methods', 'use', 'reasoning', 'also', 'look', 'art', 'interrogation.What', 'surprised', 'first', 'was', 'sparseness', 'sets', 'locations', 'sets', 'consist', 'interrogation', 'room', 'Room', '514', 'bus', 'bathroom', 'only', 'location', 'meaning', 'Room', '514.Anna', 'investigating', 'beating', 'innocent', 'Palestinians', 'highly', 'decorated', 'officer', 'Nimrod', 'Nimrod', 'accused', 'one', 'fellow', 'brigade', 'members', 'overstepping', 'bounds', 'When', 'push', 'shove', 'truth', 'revealed', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'truth', 'there', 'be', 'acted', 'Video', 'DVD', 'very', 'good', 'variable', 'bit', 'rate', 'encode', 'are', 'authoring', 'issues', 'Everything', 'crisp', 'clear', 'expect', 'DVD.Audio', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '2.0', 'audio', 'Being', 'art', 'house', 'film', 'presented', 'only', 'original', 'language', 'Hebrew', 'audio', 'nothing', 'spectacular', 'given', 'dialog', 'driven', 'drama', 'are', 'audio', 'problems', 'be', 'not', 'action', 'film', 'stereo', 'perfect', 'delivery', 'mechanism.Extras', 'Also', 'included', '15', 'minute', 'short', 'film', 'call', 'Promised', 'Land', 'short', 'look', 'woman', 'run', 'Immigration', 'caught', 'will', 'be', 'deported', 'Israel', 'not', 'bad', 'short', 'film', 'Film', 'Movement', 'films', ""'ve"", 'had', 'pleasure', 'viewing', 'well', 'done', 'theme', 'DVD', 'included', 'own', 'not', 'overly', 'note', 'worthy', 'part', 'package', 'true', 'extra', 'very', 'good.There', 'also', 'Sharon', 'Bar-Ziv', 'biography', 'text', 'video', 'rather', 'short', 'Room', '514', 'trailer', 'trailers', 'other', 'Film', 'Movement', 'films.Over', 'Room', '514', 'thought', 'provoking', 'look', 'Israeli', 'army', 'today', 'vs', 'Israeli', 'army', 'past', 'lines', 'good', 'evil', 'are', 'truly', 'blurred', 'where', 'soldiers', 'believe', 'are', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'superiors', 'turn', 'blind', 'eye.My', 'biggest', 'gripe', 'film', 'cinematography', 'camera', 'bus', 'shots', 'hand', 'held', 'one', 'hand', 'voyeuristic', 'approach', ""'m"", 'standing', 'criminal', 'shoulder', 'really', 'actors', 'personal', 'space', 'are', 'part', 'what', 'unfolding', 'problem', 'have', 'actually', 'personal', 'one', 'shaky', 'camera', 'very', 'nature', 'hand', 'held', 'filmography', 'tend', 'feel', 'sick', 'film', 'approach', 'pull', 'viewer', 'realize', 'was', 'nauseating', 'needed', 'look', 'away', 'time', 'time', 'keep', 'bearings', 'credit', 'even', 'nauseating', 'feeling', 'could', ""n't"", 'keep', 'falling', 'story', 'being', 'completely', 'engrossed', 'tale.The', 'one', 'question', ""'m"", 'left', 'hanging', 'what', 'was', 'letter', 'beauty', 'film', 'many', 'art', 'house', 'films', 'general', 'do', ""n't"", 'dumb', 'things', 'down', 'viewer', 'allow', 'form', 'own', 'opinions', 'own', 'ideas', 'concepts', 'just', 'what', 'means.Recommended.Of', 'note', 'received', 'free', 'copy', 'film', 'review', 'purposes', 'review', 'everything', 'receive', ""'ve"", 'paid', 'would', 'gladly', 'have', 'paid', 'Amazon', 'asking', 'price', 'had', 'known', 'how', 'much', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed']",Room 514
