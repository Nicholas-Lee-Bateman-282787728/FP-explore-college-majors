It keeps me watching and watching till the end. There's no moment of boredom.- The action is non-stop. It's a bloody and violent film.- It convincingly portrays the danger of steroids.- It credibly shows the deadly downside of doing business with gangsters.

1193470,A3CJKAXWFE7L8R,B001G6E7N8,"John Smith ""Bad Johnny""","[5, 7]","Rise of the Footsoldier was a recomended film to see and so I went ahead and decided to give it a go at watching. This is your basic biographical tale of the path of violence the main character decided to take, and it is a dark downward spiral of someone who's greed and need for dishing out pain to those in the underworld of England.There is nothing to like about the characters,they aren't depicted as ""good folk"" and rightly so. Basically (in his younger days) he was a dousche bag and his choice of friends weren't much different than he was. He was a drug user and a heavy anabolic steroid user and to top things off,left little to his already unstable personality and temperment.Rise of the Footsolder makes no apologies in its telling of the life of a self proclaimed ""hooligan"" and later as a full flegged gangster.I liked the true,raw depiction of events and characters (be it based on some factual events).You don't like the chasracters, and as the film continues you like them less.There is really no one to care or root for in this story, just to watch as a spectator at a soccer match to see who the last man standing is at the end.While I knew what it was I was getting myself into whatching Rise of the Footsoldier, it lacked some originality in the way the screenplay  ans story telling went.It wasn't boring, but much of the story telling is a carbon copy of Guy Ritchie and Martin Scorse films in both the telling and graphic violence.Nothing new or fresh here.I think these were very difficult parts for any actor to portray,an indiviudual who lives for violence and is abusive in nature while feeding his own addictions to both drugs and power. The other ""slight"" problem I had was the constant swearing from begining to end.I suppose that kind of dialog was to make it that much more autehtic and real,but I grew tired of everyone throwing the words S^!@?&!, f&%^@#% and c&%!#% around constantly.I spent some time in the UK and not one person I new over there (including family) cursed as much as these individuals did.Lastly were the accents,but this is really more on me. The slang and heavy Essex accents garbled together with shouting and arguing sounds like someone taking with a mouthfull of food to me. I was considering the use of the ""closed caption"" function to follow some of the conversations as occasionally I was lost with what they were specifically talking about.All in all, what you have here is a stylized biographgy of one man's experience  as a brawler,to gangster and drug dealer. How much ""legend"" he is I don't know as I am unfamiliar with the story, and underworld culture of the UK. Its not too different than anywhere else, so aside from a gang land assasination there are the similarities there.It's not a ""perfect film"" and since it copied so much from Guy Ritchie and heavily from Martin Scorse and other gangster films.This isn't Essex Boys, Lock,Stock and Two Smoking Guns, and is a far cry from Scoses's masterpiece Goodfellas,although it trys hard to be.In attempting to copycat those films in some way,it hurt this film's potential to stand on its own in my opinion.It is still watchable if you can get past the disturbing bits and unwanten cruelty and violence,but that is the life of a gangster,no apologies.",3,Footsoldier is quick to fall as fast as it rises,1290211200,"11 20, 2010",2010,3266,"['Rise', 'Footsoldier', 'was', 'recomended', 'film', 'see', 'so', 'went', 'ahead', 'decided', 'give', 'go', 'watching', 'basic', 'biographical', 'tale', 'path', 'violence', 'main', 'character', 'decided', 'take', 'dark', 'downward', 'spiral', 'someone', 'who', 'greed', 'need', 'dishing', 'out', 'pain', 'underworld', 'England.There', 'nothing', 'like', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'depicted', 'good', 'folk', 'rightly', 'so', 'Basically', 'younger', 'days', 'was', 'dousche', 'bag', 'choice', 'friends', 'were', ""n't"", 'much', 'different', 'was', 'was', 'drug', 'user', 'heavy', 'anabolic', 'steroid', 'user', 'top', 'things', 'off', 'left', 'little', 'already', 'unstable', 'personality', 'temperment.Rise', 'Footsolder', 'apologies', 'telling', 'life', 'self', 'proclaimed', 'hooligan', 'later', 'full', 'flegged', 'gangster.I', 'liked', 'true', 'raw', 'depiction', 'events', 'characters', 'be', 'based', 'factual', 'events', '.You', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'chasracters', 'film', 'really', 'one', 'care', 'root', 'story', 'just', 'watch', 'spectator', 'soccer', 'match', 'see', 'who', 'last', 'man', 'standing', 'end.While', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'was', 'getting', 'whatching', 'Rise', 'Footsoldier', 'lacked', 'originality', 'way', 'screenplay', 'story', 'telling', 'went.It', 'was', ""n't"", 'boring', 'much', 'story', 'telling', 'carbon', 'copy', 'Guy', 'Ritchie', 'Martin', 'Scorse', 'films', 'telling', 'graphic', 'violence.Nothing', 'new', 'fresh', 'here.I', 'think', 'were', 'very', 'difficult', 'parts', 'actor', 'portray', 'indiviudual', 'who', 'violence', 'abusive', 'nature', 'feeding', 'own', 'addictions', 'drugs', 'power', 'other', 'slight', 'problem', 'had', 'was', 'constant', 'swearing', 'begining', 'end.I', 'suppose', 'kind', 'dialog', 'was', 'make', 'much', 'more', 'autehtic', 'real', 'grew', 'tired', 'everyone', 'throwing', 'words', 'S^', '@', 'f', '%', '^', '@', '%', 'c', '%', '%', 'constantly.I', 'spent', 'time', 'UK', 'not', 'one', 'person', 'new', 'including', 'family', 'cursed', 'as', 'much', 'individuals', 'did.Lastly', 'were', 'accents', 'really', 'more', 'slang', 'heavy', 'Essex', 'accents', 'garbled', 'together', 'shouting', 'arguing', 'sounds', 'someone', 'taking', 'mouthfull', 'food', 'was', 'considering', 'use', 'closed', 'caption', 'function', 'follow', 'conversations', 'occasionally', 'was', 'lost', 'what', 'were', 'specifically', 'talking', 'about.All', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'stylized', 'biographgy', 'one', 'man', 'experience', 'brawler', 'gangster', 'drug', 'dealer', 'How', 'much', 'legend', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'am', 'unfamiliar', 'story', 'underworld', 'culture', 'UK', 'not', 'too', 'different', 'anywhere', 'else', 'so', 'aside', 'gang', 'land', 'assasination', 'are', 'similarities', 'there.It', 'not', 'perfect', 'film', 'copied', 'so', 'much', 'Guy', 'Ritchie', 'heavily', 'Martin', 'Scorse', 'other', 'gangster', 'films.This', ""n't"", 'Essex', 'Boys', 'Lock', 'Stock', 'Two', 'Smoking', 'Guns', 'far', 'cry', 'Scoses', 'masterpiece', 'Goodfellas', 'hard', 'be.In', 'attempting', 'copycat', 'films', 'way', 'hurt', 'film', 'potential', 'stand', 'own', 'opinion.It', 'still', 'watchable', 'can', 'get', 'disturbing', 'bits', 'unwanten', 'cruelty', 'violence', 'life', 'gangster', 'apologies']",N/A

1193475,A1K6K23WG0IBWE,B001G6E7N8,Quadro Sinead Summer,"[0, 0]","This is certainly an extremely brutal film, but not the most violent I have ever seen. I only mention this because other member reviews have suggest that this movie is one of the most brutal films ever made. Well I agree to some extent because it is extremely violent but not in as unsettling a way as perhaps some moments from other Mafia movies, such as the brutal beating by baseball bats of Nicky Santori and his gang near the end of Casino, which remains one of the most brutally unsettling mob murders ever seen in cinema. But what interests me more is the fact this this is truly a superbly crafted film that by all rights should receive considerable praise for its great acting, solid production values, excellent script and great direction. It does shamelessly borrow techniques that worked for Scorsese where his mob films are concerned. For example the ever present commentary given by the lead character, Ricchi Harnett, who by the way is simply astonishing and powerful in the role of the mob kingpin and central character. Hes simply brilliant and just wonderful in this role. He also kept reminding me of sort of a british version of Benicio Del Toro. His role is just great and I couldnt help but take serious notice of this actor, because hes a solid actor all the way, as were most of the the actors who played members of his criminal organization. I felt this film comes close to being considered an instant classic, but there are moments when it falls just a little short of measuring up to an american mafia movie. Still this film was a great experience. Harrowingly violent and brutally realistic. This is deffinatley going to be considered a classic by some and and an major disapointment by others.
