Nonetheless, I really enjoyed this show, just like the other ABC Family hit, WildFire. The simiarities of this show are great for me b/c of the teens/early 20 crowd(s) working like adults- Falcon Beach, running the Marina; WildFire, running the Ranches. On the WildFire S3 DVD, on one of the commentaries, one of the writers said that it was a pleaure writing the third season b/c the fans got to see the young adults ACTING like adults by having almost full control, if not complete control, in running the ranches; that it was an asparational fantasty for us. And it's the exact same thing here on Falcon Beach- the young adults are basically running things. I loved that so much. And I wish that on BOTH shows they had contuined that- however the 4th season of WildFire did a 380 in the 4th Season Premire and nobody was working anymore; and on Falcon Beach, unfortuantly, the show was never given the chance, having been cancelled. Of course, the blame for this is the programming, switching Falcon Beach from 8:00 pm to around 2:00 am- who the heck is awake at 2:00 am? No one that I'm aware of.Anyway, back to the show, one of my FAOVIRTE aspects was watching the romance between Paige & Nathan. I know almost every fan of this show was a Paige/Jason fan and I admit that they're adorable but I really, really, REALLY loved Paige & Nathan. They were SO hot. And they actually followed through on thier fling- making out at least once and flirting; unlike on WildFire, the beginning of S4, where in the end of S3, fans fell in love with Dani & O, and when the 4th season picked up, no mention here nor there of where the heck O was. Needless to say, I was very peeved.Regardless, this show was fantastic. I actually think I like this show a bit more then WildFire, just b/c I think that Paige & Nathan have off-the-charts Chemistry, not that on WildFire Dani & O didn't but we never saw them go down that road.This is a good show. Not great, but good. A nice escape for an hour or two from the reality of real life. It makes you smile but be warned- it's cheesy- what do you expect, being a teensoap ranging from age 14-17? But dont fret, b/c WildFire's the same way.7/10 stars.",4,REALLY wish they would release Season 2,1340064000,"06 19, 2012",2012,2306,"['really', 'REALLY', 'would', 'release', 'Season', '2', 'show', 'been', 'air', 'close', '5', 'maybe', 'even', '6', 'years', 'now', 'Nonetheless', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'show', 'just', 'other', 'ABC', 'Family', 'hit', 'WildFire', 'simiarities', 'show', 'are', 'great', 'b/c', 'teens/early', '20', 'crowd', 'working', 'adults-', 'Falcon', 'Beach', 'running', 'Marina', 'WildFire', 'running', 'Ranches', 'WildFire', 'S3', 'DVD', 'one', 'commentaries', 'one', 'writers', 'said', 'was', 'pleaure', 'writing', 'third', 'season', 'b/c', 'fans', 'got', 'see', 'young', 'adults', 'ACTING', 'adults', 'having', 'almost', 'full', 'control', 'not', 'complete', 'control', 'running', 'ranches', 'was', 'asparational', 'fantasty', 'exact', 'same', 'thing', 'here', 'Falcon', 'Beach-', 'young', 'adults', 'are', 'basically', 'running', 'things', 'loved', 'so', 'much', 'wish', 'shows', 'had', 'contuined', 'that-', 'however', '4th', 'season', 'WildFire', 'did', '380', '4th', 'Season', 'Premire', 'nobody', 'was', 'working', 'anymore', 'Falcon', 'Beach', 'unfortuantly', 'show', 'was', 'never', 'given', 'chance', 'having', 'been', 'cancelled', 'course', 'blame', 'programming', 'switching', 'Falcon', 'Beach', '8:00', 'pm', '2:00', 'am-', 'who', 'heck', 'awake', '2:00', 'am', 'No', 'one', ""'m"", 'aware', 'of.Anyway', 'back', 'show', 'one', 'FAOVIRTE', 'aspects', 'was', 'watching', 'romance', 'Paige', 'Nathan', 'know', 'almost', 'fan', 'show', 'was', 'Paige/Jason', 'fan', 'admit', ""'re"", 'adorable', 'really', 'really', 'REALLY', 'loved', 'Paige', 'Nathan', 'were', 'SO', 'hot', 'actually', 'followed', 'thier', 'fling-', 'making', 'out', 'least', 'once', 'flirting', 'WildFire', 'beginning', 'S4', 'where', 'end', 'S3', 'fans', 'fell', 'love', 'Dani', 'O', 'when', '4th', 'season', 'picked', 'up', 'mention', 'here', 'there', 'where', 'heck', 'O', 'was', 'Needless', 'say', 'was', 'very', 'peeved.Regardless', 'show', 'was', 'fantastic', 'actually', 'think', 'show', 'bit', 'more', 'then', 'WildFire', 'just', 'b/c', 'think', 'Paige', 'Nathan', 'have', 'off-the-charts', 'Chemistry', 'not', 'WildFire', 'Dani', 'O', 'did', ""n't"", 'never', 'saw', 'go', 'down', 'road.This', 'good', 'show', 'Not', 'great', 'good', 'nice', 'escape', 'hour', 'two', 'reality', 'real', 'life', 'smile', 'be', 'warned-', 'cheesy-', 'what', 'do', 'expect', 'being', 'teensoap', 'ranging', 'age', '14-17', 'dont', 'fret', 'b/c', 'WildFire', 'same', 'way.7/10', 'stars']",Falcon Beach: Season 1
