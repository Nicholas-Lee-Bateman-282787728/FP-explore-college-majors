No matter how huge of a horror fan I consider myself, I cannot spend money on some of the crap that somehow gets made into an actual film.  The only reason I decided to take a chance with Death Tunnel was because I read an article abou the film in a recent issue of Fangoria magazine.  The article was interesting, and the film sounded like it could actually be pretty cool.  It sounded really similar to Session 9, which is one of my favorite horror films.  And normally the straight-to-video films actually have pretty good (but still cheap) gore.  Let me just say that this movie is the poster child for why any horror film that goes directly to video is automatically going to suck.The film takes place in the Vanguard Sanatorium, which housed victims of the ""white death.""  The head doctor at Vanguard decided to hide the deaths of his patients by putting them in a ""death tunnel"" that was built below the building.  In present day, the institution is abandoned and, of course, haunted by the ghosts of the victims of the plague.  5 college girls are lucky enough to be part of a school initiation.  The initiation requires them to get through all 5 floors of the institution within 5 hours.  Add on the fratboy hero, and that gives us 6 possible victims for the institution's residents.While the basis of the film isn't really that bad, the execution is terrible.  For the first hour, the viewer has absolutely no idea what is going on.  We don't know why these girls are being killed, and if there is any meaning to it all.  Of course, there is the big revelation at the end that all the characters are connected to the institution, therefore the ghosts are out for vengeance.There are absolutely no original ideas here.  The main villain in the institution, the ""body collector,"" is an exact copy of Earl in House of 1000 Corpses.  I was half expecting him to pull off his mask to reveal a hideously deformed face spewing yellow goop, but I guess the filmmakers decided they had copied enough already.  The death scenes are horrible, with absolutely no good gore, and the acting is so bad that most of the ""scary"" scenes turn totally laughable.I'm going to give straight-to-video one more chance when 2001 Maniacs is released, but Death Tunnel completely soured my opinion.  And if I wasn't already a horror geek, then this film could have soured my opinion of the whole genre.  Yes, it is that bad.",1,I need to stop watching straight-to-video horror...,1143244800,"03 25, 2006",2006,2554,"['decided', 'take', 'risk', 'rent', 'Death', 'Tunnel', 'even', 'normally', 'stay', 'completely', 'away', 'horror', 'films', 'are', 'released', 'directly', 'video', 'matter', 'how', 'huge', 'horror', 'fan', 'consider', 'can', 'not', 'spend', 'money', 'crap', 'somehow', 'made', 'actual', 'film', 'only', 'reason', 'decided', 'take', 'chance', 'Death', 'Tunnel', 'was', 'read', 'article', 'film', 'recent', 'issue', 'Fangoria', 'magazine', 'article', 'was', 'interesting', 'film', 'sounded', 'could', 'actually', 'be', 'pretty', 'cool', 'sounded', 'really', 'similar', 'Session', '9', 'one', 'favorite', 'horror', 'films', 'normally', 'straight-to-video', 'films', 'actually', 'have', 'pretty', 'good', 'still', 'cheap', 'gore', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'movie', 'poster', 'child', 'why', 'horror', 'film', 'directly', 'video', 'automatically', 'going', 'suck.The', 'film', 'place', 'Vanguard', 'Sanatorium', 'housed', 'victims', 'white', 'death', 'head', 'doctor', 'Vanguard', 'decided', 'hide', 'deaths', 'patients', 'putting', 'death', 'tunnel', 'was', 'built', 'building', 'present', 'day', 'institution', 'abandoned', 'course', 'haunted', 'ghosts', 'victims', 'plague', '5', 'college', 'girls', 'are', 'lucky', 'enough', 'be', 'part', 'school', 'initiation', 'initiation', 'get', '5', 'floors', 'institution', '5', 'hours', 'Add', 'fratboy', 'hero', '6', 'possible', 'victims', 'institution', 'residents.While', 'basis', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'bad', 'execution', 'terrible', 'first', 'hour', 'viewer', 'absolutely', 'idea', 'what', 'going', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'girls', 'are', 'being', 'killed', 'meaning', 'course', 'big', 'revelation', 'end', 'characters', 'are', 'connected', 'institution', 'ghosts', 'are', 'out', 'are', 'absolutely', 'original', 'ideas', 'here', 'main', 'villain', 'institution', 'body', 'collector', 'exact', 'copy', 'Earl', 'House', '1000', 'Corpses', 'was', 'half', 'expecting', 'pull', 'off', 'mask', 'reveal', 'hideously', 'deformed', 'face', 'spewing', 'yellow', 'goop', 'guess', 'filmmakers', 'decided', 'had', 'copied', 'enough', 'already', 'death', 'scenes', 'are', 'horrible', 'absolutely', 'good', 'gore', 'acting', 'so', 'bad', 'most', 'scary', 'scenes', 'turn', 'totally', 'laughable.I', ""'m"", 'going', 'give', 'straight-to-video', 'one', 'more', 'chance', 'when', '2001', 'Maniacs', 'released', 'Death', 'Tunnel', 'completely', 'soured', 'opinion', 'was', ""n't"", 'already', 'horror', 'geek', 'then', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'soured', 'opinion', 'whole', 'genre', 'Yes', 'bad']",Death Tunnel

The story is absurd, yes, but this fact is by no means a movie killer in the horror genre (e.g., Friday the 13th - the story is stupid, but we all love it).

I guess having Halloween just two weeks ago makes a November Friday the 13th irrelevant.Death Tunnel absolutely stinks. There is NOTHING good about this movie. *Nothing* at all. Let's see what went horribly wrong (besides everything)-In the beginning you see young women partying and having fun. Honestly, we've seen the same thing a thousand times. You KNOW what's going to eventually happen- it's only a matter of time before the young ladies fall victim to some graphic violence, blood and guts, and of course, death.But Death Tunnel wants to go a step BEYOND that.Oh no- a predictable storyline isn't enough for this movie. Death Tunnel wants to go one step beyond predictable and make the lead up to the suspense *entirely* pointless with regard to atmosphere and storyline, and try to make an introduction happen with some of the most generic writing imaginable.A made-for-TV movie this one most definitely is. I feel sorry for television sets around the world that had to spend two hours being turned on for this junk.Let's see...We've seen it all before, done better in other movies like the Grudge. What am I referring to? The scenes where ghosts suddenly appear out of nowhere while loud static sounds indicate the sudden appearance of an ghostly entity. Yup, this movie features those.Movie writers don't understand that the most effective way for ghosts to be scary is to make them appear *completely silently*. I don't want to hear ANYTHING while a ghost is forming. Then the ghosts will be scary. Seems pretty simple and yet, movie writers time and time again make this tragic mistake.Here's some of the things in the movie that will make you sick (no, not sick with fear and violence- sick with pure hatred).A woman is trapped in a room and an axe suddenly smacks against the door. The woman hears this, panics, and it's laughable that the thing we see during this moment is a freakin' axe banging against the door all by itself. I guess the writers didn't want to give away what the bad guy looks like, but just the way the axe bangs against the door made me laugh VERY hard.  It indicates the poor quality of the film.Another example is a scene when one of the women walks up the stairs, and a body awkwardly drops down from the balcony, sending the woman screaming with fear down the stairs. The timing of the body falling was laughable.How about the scene with a woman standing in a room and screaming when she sees a ghostly figure of a girl quickly dart to her side and head through a door? There's NO atmosphere here so it comes across as terrible rubbish and nothing more.I hated this movie with a passion. PLEASE avoid. It doesn't even work on some campy level.

960984,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000CQQI8U,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[6, 8]","Five girls.  Five floors.  Five hours.  And believe you me, it will feel like every second of five hours before you finally reach the light at the end of the tunnel that is The End.  Now I knew going in that most people hated this movie, but I still wanted to see it, dadgummit.  After all, five sexy coeds in a haunted sanitorium can't be all that bad, can it?  The answer is a resounding Yes - it can and is that bad.  This isn't the kind of bad movie that totally amateur filmmakers might go out and shoot over the course of a weekend, either.  It takes a lot of hard work and effort to make a horror movie this wretchedly awful.  Apparently, it helps when the producer and director dress like Axl Rose.  The direction is terrible, jumping back and forth between the actual initiation and the leadup to it for at least the first half of the film and leaving a number of logistical questions completely unanswered.  Still, the brunt of the blame must fall upon the writers of this incoherent mess, for they truly deserve to be run out of town by a mob of pitchfork-wielding villagers.Kentucky's Waverly Hills Sanatorium serves as an ideal setting for the horrors that were supposed to be unleashed here (in fact, the most interesting thing on the whole DVD is the descriptions by cast and crew of some of the spooky things they really experienced there), but Death Tunnel does no favors to the very real history of this medical institution.  The filmmakers reportedly used some actual EVP recordings in the movie, but, unfortunately, there is no explanation as to how these were obtained.At least the five girls aren't bad looking at all, especially lead actress Steffany Huckaby.  Don't look for too much in the way of nudity, however, as the filmmaking Booth Brothers obviously don't subscribe to the old ""the worse the movie is, the more nudity you show"" tradition (if they did, they would have had no need for a costumer at all).  Not a single character is given an ounce of substance, so you could care less if and how any of them might die.  What you have here are just five college girls chosen for a special initiation at a Truth or Scare party.  One girl is deposited on each of the five floors (except they put two of them together for no apparent reason), and they have five hours to get out of the place by way of the infamous Death Tunnel.  They know all this, and there are pictures and newspaper clippings everywhere identifying the place as an old sanitorium, yet it takes Heather, supposedly the smart one, almost seventy-five minutes to figure it out (which takes something away from what is supposed to be a climactic scene).  And the ending?  Don't even get me started on the ending.A lot of work went into the special effects, but it's just a list of all your usual suspects - blurred images, shaking cameras, and computer-generated ghosts up the wazoo.  In other words, it's nothing we haven't seen before, especially in the past few years.  Personally, I found Death Tunnel about as scary as cutting my toenails.  I could be nice and say the filmmakers probably just tried too hard to make this movie scary, but there's no getting beyond the fact that this is one rotten egg stinker of a horror movie.",1,There is no light at the end of this cinematic tunnel,1178323200,"05 5, 2007",2007,3226,"['Five', 'girls', 'Five', 'floors', 'Five', 'hours', 'believe', 'will', 'feel', 'second', 'five', 'hours', 'finally', 'reach', 'light', 'end', 'tunnel', 'End', 'Now', 'knew', 'going', 'most', 'people', 'hated', 'movie', 'still', 'wanted', 'see', 'dadgummit', 'five', 'sexy', 'coeds', 'haunted', 'sanitorium', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'bad', 'can', 'answer', 'resounding', 'Yes', 'can', 'bad', ""n't"", 'kind', 'bad', 'movie', 'totally', 'filmmakers', 'might', 'go', 'out', 'shoot', 'course', 'weekend', 'either', 'lot', 'hard', 'work', 'effort', 'make', 'horror', 'movie', 'wretchedly', 'awful', 'Apparently', 'when', 'producer', 'director', 'dress', 'Axl', 'Rose', 'direction', 'terrible', 'jumping', 'back', 'forth', 'actual', 'initiation', 'leadup', 'least', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'leaving', 'number', 'logistical', 'questions', 'completely', 'unanswered', 'Still', 'brunt', 'blame', 'must', 'fall', 'writers', 'incoherent', 'mess', 'truly', 'deserve', 'be', 'run', 'town', 'mob', 'pitchfork-wielding', 'villagers.Kentucky', 'Waverly', 'Hills', 'Sanatorium', 'ideal', 'setting', 'horrors', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'unleashed', 'here', 'fact', 'most', 'interesting', 'thing', 'whole', 'DVD', 'descriptions', 'cast', 'crew', 'spooky', 'things', 'really', 'experienced', 'Death', 'Tunnel', 'favors', 'very', 'real', 'history', 'medical', 'institution', 'filmmakers', 'reportedly', 'used', 'actual', 'EVP', 'recordings', 'movie', 'unfortunately', 'explanation', 'how', 'were', 'obtained.At', 'least', 'five', 'girls', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', 'looking', 'especially', 'lead', 'actress', 'Steffany', 'Huckaby', 'Do', ""n't"", 'look', 'too', 'much', 'way', 'nudity', 'however', 'filmmaking', 'Booth', 'Brothers', 'obviously', 'do', ""n't"", 'subscribe', 'old', 'worse', 'movie', 'more', 'nudity', 'show', 'tradition', 'did', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'need', 'costumer', 'Not', 'single', 'character', 'given', 'ounce', 'substance', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'how', 'might', 'die', 'What', 'have', 'here', 'are', 'just', 'five', 'college', 'girls', 'chosen', 'special', 'initiation', 'Truth', 'Scare', 'party', 'One', 'girl', 'deposited', 'five', 'floors', 'put', 'two', 'together', 'apparent', 'reason', 'have', 'five', 'hours', 'get', 'place', 'way', 'infamous', 'Death', 'Tunnel', 'know', 'are', 'pictures', 'newspaper', 'clippings', 'everywhere', 'identifying', 'place', 'old', 'sanitorium', 'Heather', 'supposedly', 'smart', 'one', 'almost', 'seventy-five', 'minutes', 'figure', 'out', 'something', 'away', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'climactic', 'scene', 'ending', 'Do', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'started', 'ending.A', 'lot', 'work', 'went', 'special', 'effects', 'just', 'list', 'usual', 'blurred', 'images', 'shaking', 'cameras', 'computer-generated', 'ghosts', 'wazoo', 'other', 'words', 'nothing', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'especially', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'Personally', 'found', 'Death', 'Tunnel', 'as', 'scary', 'cutting', 'toenails', 'could', 'be', 'nice', 'say', 'filmmakers', 'probably', 'just', 'tried', 'too', 'hard', 'make', 'movie', 'scary', 'getting', 'fact', 'one', 'rotten', 'egg', 'stinker', 'horror', 'movie']",Death Tunnel

The plot is superficial, the actors relatively unskilled but the cinematography aint too bad. Plot well....that's pretty superficial too but hey it's a slasher film.Five college girls fall victim to a sorority hazing gone bad.

Simply put, five empty-headed girls are brought to the sanatorium for some initiation to survive for five hours. But unknown to them, they all have some sort of family tie to it's previous generation's victims, and the ghosts are anything but pleased they're there.Ah, blah blah blah, it doesn't make any difference because this movie stinks. Playing out like some decent looking rip-off between House On Haunted Hill '99 and Thir13en Ghosts '01, it's really hard to follow. It jumps all over the place from present, past, and not ever happening in an instant. And even if there was a little more nudity in this film it still wouldn't make me care any more about them. The acting's weak...so weak that if I wanted to see five over-hysterical women act this badly, I'd go tell my wife's family the turkey's dry at Thanksgiving. The only real reason this flix is gettin a 5 from me is the included documentary on the actual Waverly Hills Sanatorium which is more entertaining than the movie it's based on. And yes, the cinematography's not so bad, and it looked like it had a decent budget, but nothing could scare up a worthwhile script no matter how crazy you are.

960988,AR61Y2VWLST1V,B000CQQI8U,"Holly Apollyon ""Messiah of Regret and Entropy""","[15, 22]","Wow. I'll admit it. I saw phrases like haunted hospital and five coeds, and I bought this movie sight unseen. And let me say that first part again: Wow. There was so little sustenance here as to barely even constitute a movie. I found myself fascinated, more so because the story dealt with five nubile coeds in lingerie. I guess I'm just the sentimental type.The movie involved five coeds being drawn together, dressed in little lingerie outfits each with one letter to spell the word D-E-A-T-H. Chills. The blood goes cold.The Good: Crap aficionados may recognize the pixyishly attractive Heather as the prettiest girl from the abysmally abortive Scarecrow Gone Wild; she was the girl who was chased through the haystack labyrinth only to die as a precursor to the rest of the movie. Admittedly, I was also strongly drawn to the plump little villainess Ashley, who wasted no time in getting naked. Her dialogue did make me cringe, but I didn't care, I soldiered right on through it. Also, I'd like to mention Devon, a sultry exotic creature who balanced nicely against the two feisty blondes.The Bad: With the exception of the coeds, everyone else made me nostalgic for the time I had my wisdom teeth removed. The suck factor was the dominant beast, I'm sorry to say, a terrible ravening entity, consuming everything with its vacuous force. Pretty much all of the supernatural element was a watered-down version of the same stuff from the remake of The House On Haunted Hill. I watched the documentary also included on the disk, and the filmmakers claimed to have actually put various recorded phantasma inside the movie. I watched it again, and lost my focus in favor of the coeds once again.The Ugly: Zero focus. No cohesive element. No drive. No irony. They relied too much on the presence of the dank and virulent hospital itself, which was at least effective in its own rite, but not enough to glue the movie together. But you can get the same effect from Session 9, while simultaneously getting a terse and edgy movie in the process. I think the word plot is N/A in this particular situation, but further disappointments included the unexplained goggle-ghost that prowled the hospital throughout the movie with a clean-up cart, the ghost of the evil doctor who was literally a clich&eacute;-spewing machine, and the death tunnel itself, the purported focus of the entire movie---which got less play than poor doe-eyed Heather during her bit part in Scarecrow Gone Wild.Would I recommend this movie? I don't feel qualified to say. But I do recommend the five coeds, and thus, in light of their brave and buoyant contribution to this desultory effort, I award this faux-movie three stars. I do not regret buying it, and have actually watched it four times.",3,Tunnel vision gets the best of me.,1149724800,"06 8, 2006",2006,2762,"['Wow', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'saw', 'phrases', 'haunted', 'hospital', 'five', 'coeds', 'bought', 'movie', 'sight', 'unseen', 'let', 'say', 'first', 'part', 'again', 'Wow', 'was', 'so', 'little', 'sustenance', 'here', 'barely', 'even', 'constitute', 'movie', 'found', 'fascinated', 'more', 'so', 'story', 'dealt', 'five', 'nubile', 'coeds', 'lingerie', 'guess', ""'m"", 'just', 'sentimental', 'type.The', 'movie', 'involved', 'five', 'coeds', 'being', 'drawn', 'together', 'dressed', 'little', 'lingerie', 'outfits', 'one', 'letter', 'spell', 'word', 'D-E-A-T-H.', 'Chills', 'blood', 'cold.The', 'Good', 'Crap', 'aficionados', 'may', 'recognize', 'pixyishly', 'attractive', 'Heather', 'prettiest', 'girl', 'abysmally', 'abortive', 'Scarecrow', 'Gone', 'Wild', 'was', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'chased', 'haystack', 'only', 'die', 'precursor', 'rest', 'movie', 'Admittedly', 'was', 'also', 'strongly', 'drawn', 'plump', 'little', 'villainess', 'Ashley', 'who', 'wasted', 'time', 'getting', 'naked', 'dialogue', 'did', 'make', 'cringe', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'soldiered', 'right', 'Also', ""'d"", 'like', 'mention', 'Devon', 'sultry', 'exotic', 'creature', 'who', 'balanced', 'nicely', 'two', 'feisty', 'blondes.The', 'Bad', 'exception', 'coeds', 'everyone', 'else', 'made', 'nostalgic', 'time', 'had', 'wisdom', 'teeth', 'removed', 'suck', 'factor', 'was', 'dominant', 'beast', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'say', 'terrible', 'ravening', 'entity', 'consuming', 'everything', 'vacuous', 'force', 'Pretty', 'much', 'supernatural', 'element', 'was', 'watered-down', 'version', 'same', 'stuff', 'remake', 'House', 'Haunted', 'Hill', 'watched', 'documentary', 'also', 'included', 'disk', 'filmmakers', 'claimed', 'have', 'actually', 'put', 'various', 'recorded', 'phantasma', 'movie', 'watched', 'again', 'lost', 'focus', 'favor', 'coeds', 'once', 'again.The', 'Ugly', 'Zero', 'focus', 'cohesive', 'element', 'drive', 'irony', 'relied', 'too', 'much', 'presence', 'dank', 'virulent', 'hospital', 'was', 'least', 'effective', 'own', 'rite', 'not', 'enough', 'glue', 'movie', 'together', 'can', 'get', 'same', 'effect', 'Session', '9', 'simultaneously', 'getting', 'terse', 'edgy', 'movie', 'process', 'think', 'word', 'plot', 'N/A', 'particular', 'situation', 'further', 'disappointments', 'included', 'unexplained', 'goggle-ghost', 'prowled', 'hospital', 'movie', 'clean-up', 'cart', 'ghost', 'evil', 'doctor', 'who', 'was', 'literally', 'clich', 'eacute', '-spewing', 'machine', 'death', 'tunnel', 'purported', 'focus', 'entire', 'movie', '-which', 'got', 'less', 'play', 'poor', 'doe-eyed', 'Heather', 'bit', 'part', 'Scarecrow', 'Gone', 'Wild.Would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'qualified', 'say', 'do', 'recommend', 'five', 'coeds', 'thus', 'light', 'brave', 'buoyant', 'contribution', 'desultory', 'effort', 'award', 'faux-movie', 'three', 'stars', 'do', 'not', 'regret', 'buying', 'have', 'actually', 'watched', 'four', 'times']",Death Tunnel
960989,A3FUBUJAIGM87T,B000CQQI8U,"HorrorMan ""HM""","[1, 3]","I appreciate what the makers of ""Death Tunnel"" were trying to do.  Obviously, they were trying to do something different than the run of the mill mindless slasher flick, but ""Death Tunnel"" tries to do too much and it ultimately fails as a horror flick.  The problem with ""Death Tunnel"" is that it tries to be cute and overdoes it with its attempt to confuse the viewer with its convoluted plot.  If you pay enough attention, the plot becomes clear, but the viewer then realizes how stupid the movie really is and it is quite disappointing to say the least.The acting in ""The Death Tunnel"" is below average for this type of flick.  The Sanatorium/Hospital idea is not a bad idea, and it works well in some horror movies like ""Session 9"", but ""Death Tunnel"" is not in the same class as ""Session 9"" and this is clearly evident in the movies' ill-advised development.  This mess of a hopeless attempt at a plot revolves around this sanatorium where some crazy doctor went insane torturing and killing his patients.  The patients suffered from some terrible disease known as the white plague.  I must admit that I found the ghost scenes in this movie totally ineffective and completely unconvincing.  However, the real thrust of the story inheres in the doctor and five (5) nurses/hospital workers and the nexus that they along with this terrible place have with five (5) other girls from the present along some creep who is such a dork in this movie.I will stop there as I do not want to give this gem away, but the problem with this incoherent mess known as ""The Death Tunnel"" is how over the top it tries to be, especially with such a poor cast and sloppy direction.  The bottom line with ""The Death Tunnel"" is that it is stupid, and thinks it is scarier than it actually is.  As the movie progresses, it becomes more and more stupid.  Indeed, this movie sucks something awful.  Succinctly put, I found this movie totally unconvincing and quite weak as a horror movie, and, well, to use this movie's favorite phrase, ""The Death Tunnel"", as a horror movie, is an ""incurable"" mess.",1,"0 STARS: Incoherent, nonsensical, far-fetched, over the top and downright stupid.",1176508800,"04 14, 2007",2007,2077,"['appreciate', 'what', 'makers', 'Death', 'Tunnel', 'were', 'trying', 'do', 'Obviously', 'were', 'trying', 'do', 'something', 'different', 'run', 'mill', 'mindless', 'slasher', 'flick', 'Death', 'Tunnel', 'tries', 'do', 'too', 'much', 'ultimately', 'horror', 'flick', 'problem', 'Death', 'Tunnel', 'be', 'cute', 'attempt', 'confuse', 'viewer', 'convoluted', 'plot', 'pay', 'enough', 'attention', 'plot', 'clear', 'viewer', 'then', 'how', 'stupid', 'movie', 'really', 'quite', 'disappointing', 'say', 'least.The', 'acting', 'Death', 'Tunnel', 'below', 'average', 'type', 'flick', 'Sanatorium/Hospital', 'idea', 'not', 'bad', 'idea', 'well', 'horror', 'movies', 'Session', '9', 'Death', 'Tunnel', 'not', 'same', 'class', 'Session', '9', 'clearly', 'evident', 'movies', 'ill-advised', 'development', 'mess', 'hopeless', 'attempt', 'plot', 'sanatorium', 'where', 'crazy', 'doctor', 'went', 'insane', 'torturing', 'killing', 'patients', 'patients', 'suffered', 'terrible', 'disease', 'known', 'white', 'plague', 'must', 'admit', 'found', 'ghost', 'scenes', 'movie', 'totally', 'ineffective', 'completely', 'unconvincing', 'However', 'real', 'thrust', 'story', 'inheres', 'doctor', 'five', '5', 'nurses/hospital', 'workers', 'nexus', 'along', 'terrible', 'place', 'have', 'five', '5', 'other', 'girls', 'present', 'creep', 'who', 'dork', 'movie.I', 'will', 'stop', 'there', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'give', 'gem', 'away', 'problem', 'incoherent', 'mess', 'known', 'Death', 'Tunnel', 'how', 'top', 'be', 'especially', 'such', 'poor', 'cast', 'sloppy', 'direction', 'bottom', 'line', 'Death', 'Tunnel', 'stupid', 'scarier', 'actually', 'movie', 'more', 'more', 'stupid', 'Indeed', 'movie', 'something', 'awful', 'Succinctly', 'put', 'found', 'movie', 'totally', 'unconvincing', 'quite', 'weak', 'horror', 'movie', 'well', 'use', 'movie', 'favorite', 'phrase', 'Death', 'Tunnel', 'horror', 'movie', 'incurable', 'mess']",Death Tunnel

My only criticism is the DVD cover art doesn't do the movie justice. A passing consumer would most likely pass this great release up if relying on shelf shopping.

Sounds good and scary, right?  Well, that's what it could have been.  Instead, just take away the big names, the acting ability, the intelligence, the palpable emotion, and picture the madman as the most generic Saw rip-off imaginable.  That's the premise for this abomination.After being invited to a ""Truth or Scare"" party - which advises potential guests ""provocative bedtime attire a must"" - five girls, a grab-bag of beautiful, brainless, and/or busty, get dropped off on five different floors and are given five hours to wander aimlessly (like the movie itself), hyperventilate needlessly, look cute in their lingerie, and bulge out their eyes during scary scenes like Arnold did when his helmet busted open on Mars (picture Soundgarden'sBlack Hole Sunvideo).  Speaking ofTotal Recall, the lead actress (Steffany Huckaby) has the looks of an early Sharon Stone.The production value is decent, and the special effects are actually quite good, but the direction is atrocious.  This garbage jumped around so much I developed a mild case of vertigo.  For the most part this is just an excuse to introduce the young new actresses before their careers devolve towards the adult film industry.  Even the female ghosts (dressed tastefully in a low-cut nurse outfit) are busty for no other reason than the gratuitous.  Amid hallucinations, scene jumps, a character that looks like one of the Sand People from Star Wars, discontinuity that caused me physical pain, egregiously pointless flashbacks, and atrociously predictable outcomes, it's clear that this is just a really bad House on Haunted Hill remake.On the bright side, the ""bad movie requires full frontal nudity""-rule was followed.  In a completely run-down, decrepit sanatorium that inexplicably has functional electricity and clean, running water, there's a delightfully improbably scene in which the busty blonde with no acting talent whatsoever decides to take an impromptu shower before one of the worst endings in cinema history.I admit; my review title doesn't make sense.

I have been watching these direct-to-video titles for over 10 years, and once in a while you stumble on gold (Dog Soldiers comes to mind) but most of them are really, really, bad. So with that in mind I bring you the crap that is Death Tunnel, a movie that pitches us a strong premise, but strikes out big time with it's delivery. 5 girls are sorta kidnapped and asked to spend the night in a haunted sanatorium, 5 girls, 5 floors, 5 hours, cute huh? Of course they are scantilly clad, which I usually don't have a problem with, but here it's really quite un-necessary. The women are very attractive but have the acting talents, of, well, Paris Hilton comes to mind. The male lead actor, no need to tell you his name, you'll never see him again, is sad as well.This movie could have been really scary and alot of fun in the right hands, but it only accomplishes giving whoever watches it a big headache and maybe even a seizure. The switch way too much between past and present, and cut away so fast scene to scene that is literally starts to make your head hurt. They try so hard to be shocking and disturbing that they forgot what makes a good horror film scary, and that is music, settings, lighting and imagery, of which this movie has none. The ending is infuriating, they go through this awful night of 'terror' and yet decide to stay in the sanatorium to find a cure for the disease that lead to the death tunnel, absurd.This movie is actually based on true events, there was a White Plague in Kentucky in 1910 and they built a 500 foot tunnel to hide all the bodies because the founders of the sanatorium didn't want the public to know that the cures and experiments were not working. Supposedly this sanatorium is haunted in real life with many guests claiming to see some of the former patients and even the evil doctor at times. My gut feeling is if this had been made by an experienced documentary crew, this would have had more effect on it's viewers, the scare premise is there, the tortured past is there, ghosts and haunted houses always draw people, so it might have worked.

Makes sense seeing as how TB back in the day killed untold numbers of people. At first they only housed thirty to forty patients, but the surrounding area of Louisville, Kentucky was a rather swampy clime conducive to the TB bug, which meant a lot of people got the illness. In 1924 they expanded the hospital, turning the rather small building into a looming fortress of a compound that could hold upwards of 400 sick people. Fortunately, by 1943 the introduction of streptomycin radically reduced the numbers of people ill with tuberculosis. This meant that Waverly Hills Sanatorium's primary function no longer existed. After a twenty year stint as a geriatric hospital that ended in the 1980s, Waverly Hills Sanatorium closed down. How many people died in Waverly Hills from tuberculosis? Some reports say upwards of 60,000 in about four years. It's unlikely that that many patients died, but a lot of people think enough perished to fill the place to the rafters with ghosts. In fact, several television shows dealing with the paranormal have featured Waverly Hills Sanatorium in their programs. Some say it's the scariest place in the world.You just knew someone would shoot a movie in a place as offbeat as Waverly Hills, and here it is. It's called ""Death Tunnel,"" named for the long tunnel underneath the hospital supposedly used to transport the departed out of the facility, and it's made by a couple of low rent Bret Michaels lookalikes called the Booth Brothers. The film throws five attractive yet catty girls--Heather (Steffany Huckaby), Devon (Melanie Lewis), Elizabeth (Yolanda Pecoraro), Ashley (Kristin Novak), and Tori (Annie Burgstede)--into some brain dead college initiation game run by Ashley's lunkheaded jerk boyfriend Richie (Jason Lasater) that finds them locked up in Waverly Hills for five hours. I don't know what they're supposed to do in this freaky place, other than pick up a key and unlock the bags around their heads. At least that's what the voice on the loudspeaker tells them to do. The owner of this voice is, of course, one of Richie's muscle bound friends. Richie soon shows up to watch the proceedings himself, but I'm getting ahead of the script here. In the meantime, the girls wander around wearing little nighties with the first letters of their names painted on them. Conveniently, these letters spell the word ""death"".Through a series of confusing flashbacks, we come to see how these girls wound up in the Waverly Sanatorium. They're med school students (Gawd help us!) who went to Richie's party so they could all become part of the ""in"" crowd. Why there's an ""in"" crowd in medical school, or why med students dress like street tarts at beer and barf parties, is beyond me. Anyway, there was some lottery at the party, they incapacitated the girls, and the honeys wake up in Waverly Hills in the aforementioned nighties. The rest of the film sees these gals wandering around the gloomy surroundings running into the institution's ghosts. We've got a ghost with no eyes, one that plays with a ball, and some dude wearing a gas mask while pushing around a squeaking gurney. It's not very scary and, once the girls start dying in the exact same ways the ghosts died (Imagine that!), it's not very gory either. We do get to see Ashley's rack in a totally gratuitous shower scene (!!), but even that's not exciting enough to lift this movie out of the doldrums. By the time ""Death Tunnel"" screeches and judders to its mouth droppingly stupid conclusion, I just realized I witnessed one of the dumbest horror films to hit the scene since ""Feardotcom"".It's difficult to say where ""Death Tunnel"" went off the tracks. What am I saying? It's not difficult! Let's start with the acting, or should I say the lack of acting? Within ten minutes I knew this movie was gonna stink big time mainly because the acting reeked. I've seen department store mannequins deliver better performances than the ladies in this cast. Heck, I've seen folks on life support deliver better performances than this cast. Tie these lousy performances to a toilet paper script, scotch tape editing, and plot holes the size of tuberculosis scars and you've got the nightmare that is ""Death Tunnel."" The movie plumb doesn't make sense. I'll give the filmmakers points for using a scary atmosphere, but they go so overboard on trying to the make the film look gloomy that they ruin everything. We've got every type of horror movie film technique in the first five minutes, blaring techno and industrial music in inappropriate places, and a conclusion that makes as much sense as the Clinton presidency. And what was up with that shower scene? What girl would take a shower in this hellhole? And, more importantly, where in the HECK did that clean towel come from?!?If you must know, there are extras on the disc. We get a trio of trailers for other movies, a collection of photo stills, and a twenty-minute behind the scenes look at the making of the film. This laughable extra forces us to listen to the inane ramblings of the actresses as well as the rantings of the filmmakers. We're told, in all seriousness, about real hauntings during the film shoot. They even throw up some pictures of ghosts (You mean that shadow on the wall?) and EVP recordings taken inside the hospital (sounds like wind to me). I could go on and on, but I won't. ""Death Tunnel,"" which did get a few decent reviews from critics who should know better, gets a single star from me. It's derivative, pedantic drivel that deserves an even worse place than the discount bin at the dollar store. I would rather marinate in my own whizz than watch this clunker again.",1,I couldn't drink enough cough syrup to enjoy this disaster,1170201600,"01 31, 2007",2007,5735,"['built', 'Waverly', 'Hills',

960997,A10872FHIJAKKD,B000CQQI8U,Just Bill,"[3, 5]","How is it possible to set a movie in what's become known as ""the scariest place on earth"" and have it turn out so badly?Beats me. But these people managed it.The premise was passable, albeit B-movie all the way: ""Five sexy coeds who've been dared to spend the night"" in a creepy old building. (Note to future filmmakers: Any movie that starts with ""five sexy coeds"" is going to bomb.)The location (Waverly Hills Sanatorium in Louisville, KY) amply provided the creepy old building. Images of Waverly Hills, alone, are enough to give someone the willies. Despite that, the scariest thing about Death Tunnel is that it got made in the first place.The fault for this train wreck lies squarely with the script and the direction (both of which came from Philip Adrian Booth). I can't blame the actors. They probably thought it would turn out differently. At the very least, they knew they'd get a paycheck for their work. But the dialog and direction are horrendous. The director supposed mechanically-altered voices (low-pitched, of course, to sound evil), rapid jump-cuts, and grainy, often out-of-focus shots and nerve-jangling noises interspersed with whatever vapid acting was happening on screen equal suspense. He supposed wrong. They equal headache.Hopefully, Mr. Booth hasn't yet quit his day job.Watch this film only to see the setting, Waverly Hills Sanatorium. But be prepared to be thoroughly disappointed and frustrated by a movie that could have been outstanding with a better script -- and a director more interested in letting the story unfold than in taking the kitchen-sink approach by adding every horror-movie cliche ever seen.",1,"Unforgivable Direction, Story, and Acting.

Session 9 turned the Danvers State Mental Hospital into a terrifying character unto itself; Autopsy took every fear of hospitals and crammed them into a Grand Guignol. Death Tunnel uses the Waverly Hills Sanatorium as its main set, trusting that the decaying shell of the hospital will carry the story.  And for five minutes, Waverly Hills is a pretty disturbing place.But then five bimbos show up dressed in lingerie. As part of a hazing ritual, they must survive five hours in Waverly Hills. The girls don't like each other, of course.  It's never actually demonstrated why this is the case; because there isn't enough dialogue to generate any character development; we have to simply accept that the characters don't like each other, presumably due to some rivalry over the hunky male lead who helps coordinate the contest.It's amazing just how shallow Death Tunnel is. It uses every trick in the horror book: a Psycho-like shower scene, a creepy Saw-like voice, and a sepia-colored lens that has been in every horror movie ever. It throws in stuttering images, blurry ghosts, and plenty of shrieking sound effects.  Horror movies are often derided for the cheap scares generated by random squeals to jolt the audience - Death Tunnel has to be the first movie made up EXCLUSIVELY of this trick.The acting is bad.

The cutie wearing a bra and gas mask was certainly what caught my interest.  Then there is the movie.  Well, the acting was pretty bad for sure and the bad girl was just sooo bad, she was horrible, and I don't mean in a good way.  She was just a terrible choice for that part.  I knew early on that this film was in trouble when the invitation to the sorority initiation instructed the Kentucky cutie coeds to wear their sheerest baby doll negligees.  Always a bad sign.  5 coeds, 5 floors and 5 hours.  Seemed like a theme.  Seemed like it anyway.  But the point of the 5 hours, at least the way I understood it, was to survive long enough to encounter the ultimate evil:  The Death Tunnel.  Oh the horror of the dreaded Death Tunnel.  Then the Death Tunnel was just a hallway that led to ---oh my gosh---outside and sunlight.  Huh?  So after going through all this nonsense, the hero and heroine make it out to safety where they have this inane conversation about who can figure out what then they go back into the hospital through the Death Tunnel.  And at that point, I wondered what they were going to do to end the movie.  And then the credits rolled.  The point is, don't buy this.  Don't rent it.

961006,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000CQQI8U,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 3]","Death Tunnel (Philip Adrian Booth, 2005)I finished watching this movie and thought to myself, ""Man, this was a movie with so very much potential, and every last bit of it was strangled, frame by frame, with the kind of glee that only the truly incompetent can manage.""Yes, I thought that. In exactly those words. So don't get on me about it, okay?Plotwise, the beginning of the movie is rather confusing, but then maybe some colleges do things differently than mine did. Richie (Undressed's Jason Lasater), the charismatic leader of some sort of campus social club, emcees a party at which five girls are chosen to spend five hours during the night at a local, supposedly haunted, abandoned hospital-- Devon (Melanie Lewis, who has the disticntion of having appeared in both Gigli AND From Justin to Kelly!), Elizabeth (Yolanda Pecroraro in her first big-screen role), Ashley (Cemetery Gates' Kristin Novak), Tori (TV character actor Annie Burgstede), and Heather (Disconnect's Steffany Huckaby). There's a lot of foreshadowing kind of stuff that makes very little sense, given how little we actually learn about these women (and everyone else) before we get to the hospital, but I was willing to overlook that because the stuff intercut with all the foreshadowing and attempts at character building was quite intriguing-- newspaper clips flying around the screen about the depravity at the hospital, voiceovers, hints at assorted nastiness, that sort of thing. It rather seemed the filmmakers were going to do something more interesting with the backstory than they were with what was happening in the present, which would certainly have been an interesting approach. This, of course, went out the window pretty quick once we got everyone to the hospital itself. There the movie becomes your basic supernatural-slasher flick, with more time spent on devising interesting ways to do people in than with such trivialities as plot, characterization, pacing, and the like. And, of course, we get the typical, predictable ending with one surviving character, one redeemed villain, and the oh-so-surprising revelation that you saw coming five minutes into the film.We have recently been blessed with a number of fantastic microbudget indie horror films (Deadbirds immediately comes to mind); Death Tunnel, despite all the possibilities inherent in it, is not one of them.

That movie was unrated, but not because of its content.  This movie is rated R and actually delivers the elements that a hokey horror movie should have:  scantily clad chicks with occasional nudity, pervasive bad language, and intense scenes of bloody violence and gore. One very good thing about this movie is the gore scenes and some of the haunting images, which are both top-notch.  I did not find the movie very scary, but it is an interesting movie, both storywise and visually, until about half way through.  What happens halfway through is that the guy whose plan it was to put the girls in the sanitarium decides to go and try to get the girls out, and then he hangs out with Heather once he finds her for the rest of the movie.  The last half of the movie is them trying to escape, which is not very horrifying.  It would have been nice instead if the guy was killed.

Abandoned large building with greasy walls and constant dripping via Hostel and Nine Inch Nails videos. Check. Gratuitous nude scene from the least attractive actress in the movie. Oh yeah.

You don't like these people. You don't care about them. The evil girl is slightly entertaining, but she obviously got the job by being the producer's girlfriend. The editor had a lot of fun keeping things non-linear (flashback. College scenes. In hospital scenes. College scenes. Flashback.) and you suspect that he was deciding what went where by rolling dice. That does not make an artistic achievement (although it adds Tarantino non-linear storytelling to the list of derivative techniques).All in all, this is a movie that you have to be drunk to enjoy and the amount of alcohol you need to buy this from Amazon has not been invented.

The best part is the cover, which really doesn't even fit the movie. Then again, the story makes no sense. Every scene is illogical; nothing makes sense. Suspension of disbelief only goes so far. Please watch something else, no matter hoe cheap this gets.

961016,A38N7SFDOB3MR3,B000CQQI8U,Wisconsin Dad,"[0, 4]","Death Tunnel began with promise. Early in the movie we were treated to some unique visuals, wonderful music, and a good feel. Them the actors opened their mouths and Death Tunnel fell apart.Death Tunnel is the story of 5 college girls who, seeking an initiation into a party clique, are picked into a hazing ceremony which leads them to an old hospital where white plague victims were slaughtered. The building holds much more than they suspect, including angry (and dull!) ghosts. From here the madness ensues and the blood flows.Death Tunnel drags after the first 30 minutes, and holds few frights. The story gets dull once the girls are trapped, for nothing really happens other than 45 minutes of filming tricks. During this time we are tortured with an abundance of horrible acting; some of the worst in an horror film I have seen this year. The acting leaves you scratching your head, wondering how any film studio will give a director/producer $2 million to make Death Tunnel and allow them to squander the money on junk talent.And in the end, that is what kills Death Tunnel: pitiful acting. The acting is scary, the movie isn't. Run away from this stinker. Run very, very far away and don't look back.Total Score (out of 100) = 1811 (out of 50). Enjoyment.

961017,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B000CQQI8U,Wuchak,"[0, 0]","Philip Adrian Booth's 2005 film ""Death Tunnel"" is a well-made horror flick about five college gals (in lingerie) locked in a huge abandoned sanatorium in Kentucky where 63,000 people died of the ""white plague"" in the early 20th century. This is supposed to be a college initiation, but things go sour when the ghosts of the plague victims show up!I was surprised to discover that the acting was quite good by all the principles, at least for a Grade B horror flick. I say ""surprised"" because a few armchair critics diss the film for the supposed bad acting. Yes, there may be some side characters whose acting is questionable, but that's about it. A possible exception would be the girl who plays Ashley (Kristin Novak) and her over-the-top performance during the shower sequence, but this can be defended on the grounds that the script required a low camp approach to pull it off. How else could she deliver such dialog and be effective? She did it the way it had to be done.""Death Tunnel"" is amazing because of its entertaining style. As far as filmmaking technique goes, this is top-of-the-line all the way. One reviewer properly described it as ""extremely impressive visual style combined with top notch kinetic editing work."" It's impossible to watch this movie and not be wowed by the filmmaking technique, even if you don't like the story or the way it's told (more on this below). It blows my mind to think of the time & effort put into creating this film. Such attention to detail is rare, particularly in low-budget independent fare.In addition to the filmmaking technique, the locations, cast and score/soundtrack are superb. The film was largely shot at Waverly Hills Sanatorium near Louisville, KY, which is a perfect location for a horror flick. The film also features numerous ultra-gorgeous women, including the ones trying in vain to get out of the sanatorium, a couple of the ghosts and even more. It's Grade A on this front. There's also a genuine aura of creepiness & a few good scares. Plus the modern metal song ""Disconnected"" by 9 Volt Revolt is excellent (featured in both the story and the end credits).All this gels together for a massively amusing work of celluloid.There's only one potential problem and that's the way the story is told, which explains my mediocre rating the first time I viewed ""Death Tunnel."" The simple plot is presented in a very convoluted manner, mostly in the first act. There are so many flashbacks, flashforwards and flashbetweens it gets confusing and tempts the viewer to tune out. But this settles down in the second and third acts where the story focuses on the five girls trying to get out of the sanatorium.I suspect the filmmakers took this non-linear approach -- mostly in the first act -- in order to disorient the viewer. If so, it works. But this may be oft-putting on your initial viewing because you have to concentrate in order for the story to pull you in. I suggest re-watching the film, kick back, and just let it give you a good time. I did and it did. The story comes together.A more linear approach to the storytelling would probably have made ""Death Tunnel"" more compelling, but after re-watching the film it dawned on me that Booth was shooting for art and originality above horror conventions. This should be respected. Besides, I was able to enter into the world of the movie and was mesmerized. What more could you ask for in an independent horror flick?FINAL WORD: ""Death Tunnel"" successfully combines grisly locations & F/X with stunningly beautiful women and a kinetic style for an amazingly entertaining film. What's more, the ending is actually moving -- there is a light at the end of the death tunnel.GRADE: B+",4,Amazing filmmaking,1310860800,"07 17, 2011",2011,3696,"['Philip', 'Adrian', 'Booth', '2005', 'film', 'Death', 'Tunnel', 'well-made', 'horror', 'flick', 'five', 'college', 'gals', 'lingerie', 'locked', 'huge', 'abandoned', 'sanatorium', 'Kentucky', 'where', '63,000', 'people', 'died', 'white', 'plague', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'supposed', 'be', 'college', 'initiation', 'things', 'go', 'sour', 'when', 'ghosts', 'plague', 'victims', 'show', 'up', 'was', 'surprised', 'discover', 'acting', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'principles', 'least', 'Grade', 'B', 'horror', 'flick', 'say', 'surprised', 'few', 'armchair', 'critics', 'diss', 'film', 'supposed', 'bad', 'acting', 'Yes', 'may', 'be', 'side', 'characters', 'acting', 'questionable', 'possible', 'exception', 'would', 'be', 'girl', 'who', 'Ashley', 'Kristin', 'Novak', 'over-the-top', 'performance', 'shower', 'sequence', 'can', 'be', 'defended', 'grounds', 'script', 'required', 'low', 'camp', 'approach', 'pull', 'off', 'How', 'else', 'could', 'deliver', 'such', 'dialog', 'be', 'effective', 'did', 'way', 'had', 'be', 'done', 'Death', 'Tunnel', 'amazing', 'entertaining', 'style', 'As', 'far', 'filmmaking', 'technique', 'top-of-the-line', 'way', 'One', 'reviewer', 'properly', 'described', 'extremely', 'impressive', 'visual', 'style', 'combined', 'top', 'notch', 'kinetic', 'editing', 'work', 'impossible', 'watch', 'movie', 'not', 'be', 'wowed', 'filmmaking', 'technique', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'story', 'way', 'told', 'more', 'below', 'mind', 'think', 'time', 'effort', 'put', 'creating', 'film', 'Such', 'attention', 'detail', 'rare', 'particularly', 'low-budget', 'independent', 'fare.In', 'addition', 'filmmaking', 'technique', 'locations', 'cast', 'score/soundtrack', 'are', 'superb', 'film', 'was', 'largely', 'shot', 'Waverly', 'Hills', 'Sanatorium', 'Louisville', 'KY', 'perfect', 'location', 'horror', 'flick', 'film', 'also', 'numerous', 'ultra-gorgeous', 'women', 'including', 'ones', 'trying', 'vain', 'get', 'sanatorium', 'couple', 'ghosts', 'even', 'more', 'Grade', 'A', 'front', 'also', 'genuine', 'aura', 'creepiness', 'few', 'good', 'scares', 'modern', 'metal', 'song', 'Disconnected', '9', 'Volt', 'Revolt', 'excellent', 'featured', 'story', 'end', 'credits', '.All', 'gels', 'together', 'massively', 'amusing', 'work', 'celluloid.There', 'only', 'one', 'potential', 'problem', 'way', 'story', 'told', 'mediocre', 'rating', 'first', 'time', 'viewed', 'Death', 'Tunnel', 'simple', 'plot', 'presented', 'very', 'convoluted', 'manner', 'mostly', 'first', 'act', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'flashbacks', 'flashforwards', 'confusing', 'viewer', 'tune', 'out', 'down', 'second', 'third', 'acts', 'where', 'story', 'five', 'girls', 'trying', 'get', 'sanatorium.I', 'suspect', 'filmmakers', 'took', 'non-linear', 'approach', 'mostly', 'first', 'act', 'order', 'disorient', 'viewer', 'so', 'may', 'be', 'oft-putting', 'initial', 'viewing', 'have', 'concentrate', 'order', 'story', 'pull', 'suggest', 're-watching', 'film', 'kick', 'back', 'just', 'let', 'give', 'good', 'time', 'did', 'did', 'story', 'together.A', 'more', 'linear', 'approach', 'storytelling', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'made', 'Death', 'Tunnel', 'more', 'compelling', 're-watching', 'film', 'dawned', 'Booth', 'was', 'shooting', 'art', 'originality', 'horror', 'conventions', 'should', 'be', 'respected', 'was', 'able', 'enter', 'world', 'movie', 'was', 'mesmerized', 'What', 'more', 'could', 'ask', 'independent', 'horror', 'flick', 'FINAL', 'WORD', 'Death', 'Tunnel', 'successfully', 'grisly', 'locations', 'F/X', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'women', 'kinetic', 'style', 'amazingly', 'entertaining', 'film', 'What', 'more', 'ending', 'actually', 'moving', 'light', 'end', 'death', 'tunnel.GRADE', 'B+']",Death Tunnel
