602681,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JLOB,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","I've been a longstanding fan of this film for years now.  I've only seen it a few times (a few is enough) but it is a film that has stayed with me and has continued to move me the more I think about it.  There are quite a few films released today that tackle the delicate subject of grief, but there are few that approach it with such honesty.The film follows Joe Nast, a young man engaged to be married who has his entire future thrown into a tizzy when his fianc&eacute; is killed.  He basically moves in with his would-be-in-laws, Ben and Jojo Floss, and starts to piece together what will be the rest of his life.  He wants so desperately to be exactly what they need him to be, and what he's convinced he is supposed to be, but haunting secrets (totally BREAK.MY.HEART secrets) keep him nearly emotionally stunted, and when he meets and becomes emotionally involved with a young woman named Bertie Knox, his life starts to take a shape he's almost ashamed and frightened of.For anyone who has ever lost a loved one rather suddenly, `Moonlight Mile' is a tender and authentic approach to the unraveling of the `life ever after'.For me, this film is elevated so beautifully by the entire cast.  Jake Gyllenhaal has risen in the ranks as one of the more talented young stars, but his recognition (for me at least) came a little late.  His best work was done in his early career, and this may be his finest hour (upon reflection, his `Brokeback Mountain' work, while effective, pales in comparison to his cast mates).  The way that Jake centers his characters complex emotional currency is brilliantly used to reign in the audience.  Ellen Pompeo is also stunningly effective as the wide-eyed and tender woman who steals Joe's heart.  Veteran actors Dustin Hoffman and Susan Sarandon are just magnificent as the two bookends that hold this movie together.  They play their characters drastically different, which beautifully unfolds the many layers of the tragedy of grief.  Their breakdowns are especially moving (Hoffman's, in the diner, just crushed me).The entire cast truly UNDERSTANDS this movie.The film draws it's inspiration from real life experience (the director's story alone is heartbreaking), but the inspiration for the films title, `Moonlight Mile', is really what establishes the films heart.  The song `Moonlight Mile', by The Rolling Stones, is a beautiful song about separation from the ones we love.  The words ""I am just living to be lying by your side"" help us grasp exactly where this film is headed, and the emotions we are going to be experiencing.Films like this can be difficult at times because they evoke such raw and real emotions from the viewer, but they are important for they show us that there are those who understand, that we are not alone, and that there is life after `death'.",5,Is there life after death?,1266451200,"02 18, 2010",2010,2817,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'longstanding', 'fan', 'film', 'years', 'now', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'few', 'times', 'few', 'enough', 'film', 'stayed', 'continued', 'move', 'more', 'think', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'films', 'released', 'today', 'delicate', 'subject', 'grief', 'are', 'few', 'approach', 'such', 'honesty.The', 'film', 'Joe', 'Nast', 'young', 'man', 'engaged', 'be', 'married', 'who', 'entire', 'future', 'thrown', 'tizzy', 'when', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'killed', 'basically', 'would-be-in-laws', 'Ben', 'Jojo', 'Floss', 'piece', 'together', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'rest', 'life', 'so', 'desperately', 'be', 'exactly', 'what', 'need', 'be', 'what', 'convinced', 'supposed', 'be', 'haunting', 'secrets', 'totally', 'BREAK.MY.HEART', 'secrets', 'keep', 'nearly', 'emotionally', 'stunted', 'when', 'emotionally', 'involved', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Bertie', 'Knox', 'life', 'take', 'shape', 'almost', 'ashamed', 'frightened', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'lost', 'loved', 'one', 'rather', 'suddenly', 'Moonlight', 'Mile', 'tender', 'authentic', 'approach', 'unraveling', 'life', 'ever', 'film', 'elevated', 'so', 'beautifully', 'entire', 'cast', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'risen', 'ranks', 'one', 'more', 'talented', 'young', 'stars', 'recognition', 'least', 'came', 'little', 'late', 'best', 'work', 'was', 'done', 'early', 'career', 'may', 'be', 'finest', 'hour', 'reflection', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'work', 'effective', 'pales', 'comparison', 'cast', 'mates', 'way', 'Jake', 'centers', 'characters', 'complex', 'emotional', 'currency', 'brilliantly', 'used', 'reign', 'audience', 'Ellen', 'Pompeo', 'also', 'stunningly', 'effective', 'wide-eyed', 'tender', 'woman', 'who', 'Joe', 'heart', 'Veteran', 'actors', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'are', 'just', 'magnificent', 'two', 'bookends', 'hold', 'movie', 'together', 'play', 'characters', 'drastically', 'different', 'beautifully', 'many', 'layers', 'tragedy', 'grief', 'breakdowns', 'are', 'especially', 'moving', 'Hoffman', 'diner', 'just', 'crushed', '.The', 'entire', 'cast', 'truly', 'movie.The', 'film', 'inspiration', 'real', 'life', 'experience', 'director', 'story', 'alone', 'heartbreaking', 'inspiration', 'films', 'title', 'Moonlight', 'Mile', 'really', 'what', 'films', 'heart', 'song', 'Moonlight', 'Mile', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'beautiful', 'song', 'separation', 'ones', 'love', 'words', 'am', 'just', 'living', 'be', 'lying', 'side', 'help', 'grasp', 'exactly', 'where', 'film', 'headed', 'emotions', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'experiencing.Films', 'can', 'be', 'difficult', 'times', 'evoke', 'such', 'raw', 'real', 'emotions', 'viewer', 'are', 'important', 'show', 'are', 'who', 'understand', 'are', 'not', 'alone', 'life', 'death']",Moonlight Mile
602682,A2WX1UESDOLXRE,B00005JLOB,"Ashley Quinn ""Ash""","[13, 16]","Susan Surandon, Dustin Hoffman, and Jake Gyllenhaal have truly outdone themselves. Surandon and Hoffman play grieving parents, Gyllenhaal is their would be son-in-law. Each give stellar perfomances and the script is amazing, both of which straddle the line between tragedy and comedy. As soon as a tear comes to your eye, Surandon's character Jo will blurt out a randomly brash straightforward comment that will make you laugh.Ben (Hoffman) and Jo (Surandon) have just lost their only child, Diane, who was tragically shot in a diner. She was to be married to Joe (Gyllenhaal), who ends up staying with Ben and Jo because he has secrets that force him to believe it's the right thing to do. Then Joe meets a girl named Bertie, who helps him fish out his wedding invitations at the post office. Joe is attracted to Bertie, but he also doesn't want to hurt anyone.The movie is a little slow, but I'm forgiving when a movie turns out to be so incredible. There were points in the movie when I had a hard time watching, just because it brings forth memories in my life which are sad, but unforgettable. As sad as I may have gotten while watching this movie, it makes me not want to forget.I highly recommend this movie.

He is like this in many of his films, but he's so attractive that I couldn't care less. I also got annoyed looking at Ellen Pompeo throughout the whole film.

602684,AM2VJQCJWBBSG,B00005JLOB,"BrooklynBEM ""BrooklynBEM""","[7, 9]","A disappointment to say the least. I can see the goal here - create a film about people with little-to-no emotion dealing with a very emotional issue.  However, since the main characters don't seem to care too much that their daughter has been murdered a WHOLE three days ago, the general suspense that her fiance's &quot;secret&quot; might carry doesnt really matter much. As that &quot;fiance Joe&quot;, Jake Gyllenhaul (so good in &quot;Lovely and Amazing&quot; &amp; &quot;the Good Girl&quot;) is simply too light an actor for such a meaty role. The movie needed at least one character with a genuine sense of grief to balance the Stronger-than-the-average-bear types played with a tad too much gusto by Sarandon and Hoffman.  Watching the deleted scenes (with comentary) it is clear the writer/director wanted to make a cold unsimpathetic film about life and loss...and he did.  Holly Hunter and Dabney Coleman(!) are surprisingly effective in small roles, as is the soundtrack.

602685,A2PBV1899CX3TE,B00005JLOB,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[0, 2]","There is no way around it. Moonlight Mile was a well-meaning but misguided failure. I wanted to like it. It had one or two moments. But it was a huge waste.Here's why:1. Nothing of any importance happens. It is really about a guy named Joe Nast (Jake Gyllenhaal) who was going to marry a young woman who was killed. You never see much of her (actually, you see nothing whatsoever of her), because the plot is that they broke up just before she was killed and he never told her parents, Ben and Jo Jo Floss (Dustin Hoffman and Susan Sarandon). He is living with them, and is a kind of surrogate son, filling the hole she left. More about that later, because there is actually an interesting story behind the story, but the interesting part didn't show up on screen.2. Jake as Joe Nast is so bland and passive, it's impossible to care about him. Somehow I kept thinking of Tobey Maguire--or Topher Grace, even. Now, Jake, Tobey, and Topher are all good actors, but they are kind of cute boy-men, and if their roles don't have any teeth, then all is lost.3. Hoffman and Sarandon are also actors that I like, but they are also too bland here. Hoffman's Ben Floss is a commercial Real Estate Agent who wants to put a deal together for a developer (Dabney Coleman) that would basically turn their quaint little town into a Gestapo wallmart. He doesn't even flinch. Sarandon's Jo Jo (and that was just strange, having the putative son-in-law having basically the same name) was a little feisty, like a nun who tries to get cold blooded killers out of the death penalty, but nowhere near a Louise who would drive her station wagon over a cliff. Their reaction to Joe's deception when he finally confesses on the witness stand--to the detriment of the murder trial of their daughter's killer--that he had broken up with her before she was killed, is nonplussed at best.---------------------[Jo Jo is throwing self help books into a fire]Ben Floss: Those were gifts.Jo Jo Floss: ""Grieving for Grownups""?Ben Floss: They're supposed to be helpful.Jo Jo Floss: Please. THIS is helpful.[Throws another book into the fire]==============4. The main tension in the plot, not that it amounts to much, is that Joe meets Bertie Knox, a goofy gal at the post office when he goes to intercept the wedding invitations. They both are mourning a loss, and are attracted to each other, but it is too soon for Joe to get involved, or it would be seen as too soon by Ben and Jo Jo, who Joe's mooching off. Bertie Knox (where does he come up with these names?) is played by Ellen Pompeo, who is best known as Dr. Meredith Grey, she of the infatuation with McSteamy or McDreamy in the abysmal but nevertheless popular Grey's Anatomy. I kept thinking that this was a role that was meant for Jenna Elfman, but she was too busy preparing an L. Ron Hubbard tribute for Tom and Kate's wedding reception. Bertie Knox was like one of those Elfman roles, Dharma Finklestein, or Frankie on Two and a Half Men. The goofy free spirit who appears before the constipated hero to tantalize and tempt him. OK, here was one of the nice moments that I liked in this misbegotten film:--------------------[Bertie and Joe start slow dancing to the Rolling Stones' ""Moonlight Mile""]Joe Nast: What did I do?Bertie: You played my song.================Joe didn't like the crappy song that was playing on the juke box and he switched it to Moonlight Mile by The Rolling Stones. That is a great song, I have to admit, and it was kind of magical when they just started dancing to it. Oh, yeah, did I mention that Bertie Knox, besides being the postmaster, was also the bartender/bar owner? The story on the song, though, was that they really wanted Baby's in Black by The Beatles, and that was also going to be the film title, but Michael Jackson wanted too much for it. Baby's in Black might have been more relevant to the 'plot' but Moonlight Mile has more magic.-----------------Bertie: So, commercial real-estate?Joe Nast: Commercial real-estate.Bertie: What the hell does that mean?Joe Nast: [laughing] I have no idea.Bertie: And this is what you want to do?Joe Nast: Not really.Bertie: Oh, and what do you want to do?Joe Nast: I want to figure out what I want to do.Bertie: So you're kind of in ""Escrow"" at the moment?... real-estate term.Joe Nast: Yeah, I recognized that one[chuckles]==========Now, earlier I mentioned that there was an intriguing story behind the story, so here it is: Writer/Director Brad Silberman was dating actress Rebecca Schaeffer at the time she was killed by a crazed stalker in 1989, and Moonlight Mile is loosely based on his experience. Schaeffer was best known for her role on ""My Sister Sam"" with Pam Dawber, and now she is remembered because since it was so easy for her killer, Robert John Bardo, to get a hold of her records and address, laws were passed to protect personal information at places like the DMV. Bardo, who killed her when she was only 21, was sentenced to life in prison. As with John Lennon's killer Mark David Chapman before him, Bardo, was found to have in his possession a copy of J.D. Salinger's ""Catcher in the Rye"" at the time of his arrest.So, I like all the actors, and I love the song, Moonlight Mile, and the director has a compelling story (though if he had broken up with Rebecca prior to her death and milked the situation like Joe Nast, then that is a troubling thought) and I wanted to like his movie--but Bottom Line is that I just couldn't. It was a heavy topic spun into fluff that will blow away in the slightest breeze.Zodiac (Widescreen Edition)(2007) Jake Gyllenhaal was Robert GraysmithBrokeback Mountain(2005) Jake Gyllenhaal was Jack TwistOld School (Widescreen Unrated Edition)(2003) Ellen Pompeo was NicoleDaredevil (Director's Cut)(2003) Ellen Pompeo was Karen PageIgby Goes Down(2002) Susan Sarandon was Mimi SlocumbDonnie Darko(2001) Jake Gyllenhaal was Donnie DarkoO Brother, Where Art Thou?(2000) Holly Hunter was PennyThelma & Louise(1991) Susan Sarandon was Louise SawyerThe Graduate(1967) Dustin Hoffman was Ben BraddockMidnight Cowboy(1969) Dustin Hoffman was Ratso--------------Joe Nast: [chuckles] Ew.

It opens as a comedy, becomes a drama, goes back to comedy, then to drama. This shifting focus does a disservice to the central theme of grief--with its attendant sub-themes of guilt and anger and denial. Gyllenhaal turns in a solid, believable performance as the fiance of the murdered woman. Dustin Hoffman drifts in and out of focus as the woman's father. But Susan Sarandon is just extraordinary as the fiercely intelligent, angry yet witty, grief-stricken mother. When she's onscreen the movie is electrically alive. It's hard to buy Hoffman as this woman's husband; not that his performance is bad, it's just not up there with Sarandon's.

It has its moments, but ultimately seems to be about nothing in particular.  Just a few minor observations.This is a very unconventional look at the grieving process.  It's hard to tell at first that a tragedy occurred because the parents crack jokes and act obnoxious.  It's not unrealistic, no, but there has to be more than that.  And I waited for more.  For something.  It never came.  Just a silly courtroom conclusion, which seemed to exist mostly to get an ""aww shucks, isn't he cute!"" redemption for Jake G's empty character.  Sounds like an easy payoff for moviegoer's that like that kind of thing.  I'm not one of them.Although I initially found the idea appealing, I was ultimately bothered by the fact this movie was set in the early 70s.  What was the point?  The director was inspired by events that happened to him in 1989.  So why 1971/72?  It seemed like a forced attempt to make the movie sort of retro-cool.  The times had nothing to do with the story.  They also threw in the obligatory Viet Nam subplot (the girl's boyfriend is MIA in Viet Nam--whoa, that's so heavy and cool).I felt this movie existed to give simple-minded moviegoers warm and fuzzies, with a feeling that they visited an important time and place.  Whatever.  I thought the characters were all empty.One thing I did like--the main thing I liked--was Ellen Pompeo as the boy's new love interest.  I think she is a real find.  I at first couldn't get over the resemblance to Renee Zellweger, which turned me off since I'm still reeling from Renee's grating performance in ""Jerry Maguire"".  But I really grew to like her (Ellen Pompeo), and I think she will be interesting to watch in the future.  As for Mr. G., he's a yawn-and-a-half and will only be a star as long as he can get away with that ""aww-shucks"" charm.  He doesn't seem to have much to offer as an actor other than that.  Or maybe it was just the weak script.

602690,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B00005JLOB,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[12, 13]","In 1971 'The Rolling Stones' recorded a beautiful track entitled 'Moonlight Mile' which is about being away from the ones you love.  In the song he sings the words ""I am just living to be lying by your side"" and in those words we get it...we understand, and that is why this song, this title is so appropriate for a film of this grander.  Susan Surandon and Dustin Hoffman star in this beautiful and touching film about losing the most important thing in your life, your child.  Diana is engaged to Joe (Gyllenhaal in a powerful, pre-Brokeback, performance) when her life is taken by a madman.  She is shot to death while being served in a diner.  The movie opens with Joe, Ben (Hoffman) and Jojo (Surandon) getting ready to attend their daughters funeral.  The next few seens really set the tone of the film and establish the roles your charactors will play.  Within the first five minutes we see that Joe is uncomfortable, almost in his own skin, shy and reclusive and afraid of his suroundings.  THis is not his town, these are not his friends, this is not his family and still he stays.  Jojo appears strong, stronger than those around her but that's only because she doesn't know how to feel.  It's only been three days.  How does a mother feel THREE DAYS after her only child is murdered.  SO to compensate Jojo finds humor in her situation and in those who share it with her.  Ben feels a sense of responcibility.  He's the sensible one, conciderate and understanding and appreciative of everyones good intentions regardless of how much he resents them for it.  He may not want to see anyone right now, but he puts on a smile and says ""thank you very much"" because he knows you care.  Those are your charactors, and that's your tone, uncomfortable, humorus and understanding.  This film takes a VERY realistic approach to grief.  Your uncomfortable, especially if you've never faced anything like this before.  Your so uncomfortable that you tend to try anything to make yourself comfortable again, even if that means making jokes to place a smile on your otherwise blank face.  And this film, is above all things, understanding for it really shows the stages one takes to overcome something like this.  Jake Gyllenhaal says it best when he's invited to dinner at a colleges house.  It's just not something you 'get over'.  The story follows Joe as he lives with Jojo and Ben, mostly out of obligation but you come to realize that he may need them as much as they need him.  When Joe meets Birdie (Ellen Pompeo in a superb performance), a local girl working at the post office they both start to form a bond, partly out of pure infactuation.  When they dance to 'Moonlight Mile' it will all make sense, for it was that part of the film that did it for me.  You spend all your time thinking over and over in your mind that things could have or should have been different, you spend so much time thinking about what could have been that you forget to think about what is GOING to happen next.  As I said in the beginning, the song says ""I am just living to be lying by your side""...but what if it's not refering to your love lost but to your love now, right in front of your eyes..and at that moment, while they danced in the bar, I got it, and I think they did too.  A beautiful, touching and emotional story that reaches in and tugs at the heartstrings of any living breathing human being.

602691,A2ZJ2H6DRSPVZ8,B00005JLOB,Diane Stranz,"[0, 1]","As many other reviewers have noted, this film had a lot of potential:  big name actors, interesting story premise, the potential to educate the larger public about the realities of grief.  But ultimately it fails to deliver.  The film is very sad, but it's hard to become emotionally involved with any of the characters because even for people marred by grief, they act too weirdly to connect with.First, some reviewers have said that these people are cold, unemotional and do not really seem to care that their close loved one has just died.  I didn't see that; the stereotype is that people in grief look obviously sad and do things which we all expect sad people to do, but that is WRONG, especially if the grief is new and shocking (like a daughter getting gunned down at the friendly neighborhood lunch counter across the street from your office where your daughter hung out with you when she was a child).An 8th grade girl at the junior high where I once served as a substitute teacher was raped and murdered in her own bed by a neighbor who came in through a window.  At the memorial service her mother looked very calm and serene -- she never cried, smiled at people as she shook their hands, and did not look grief stricken at all.  But when I hugged her, she hung on to me like a drowning person grasping a lifeboat and I could tell that she was consumed with grief.  Needless to say, I did not appreciate hearing allthe junior high kids at school the next week 'dissing' their classmate's mother by talking about how 'obvious' it had been that the mother had not cared her daughter was dead.  To be sure, my classes and I had several intense heart-to-heart talks about the paralyzing realities of deep, inexpressible grief and how wrong it is to make assumptions about someone else's emotional state.But!  That said, it was hard for me to connect with many of the personality characteristics of these characters.  If Jake Gyllenhaal's character and his fiancee were calling off the wedding, why did they not tell her parents together -- especially since the wedding invitations were already being mailed out?  Why did Dustin Hoffman's character not even CONSIDER that maybe his not-to-be son-in-law's occupational plans might change in light of his daughter's murder and, instead, charge &#34;full steam ahead&#34; with the pre-murder plans without even a discussion? (That seemed very unrealistic to me.)The murdered fiance (Diane) does not seem like someone I would like much:  she apparently manipulated Jake Gyllenhaal's character into agreeing to go into business with her father, and Susan Sarandon's character said she only became a writer in order to please her daughter (which is way weird, to say the least).  And don't even go there with Jake Gyllenhaal finding his 'soul mate' within only a few weeks of Diane's murder.  Yes it is believable he would REBOUND into bed with another woman (out of grief, confusion, feelings of loneliness and abandonment) but it is completely unbelievable that the relationship would be real or permanent.  And what is up with that woman working for years for free for a man who has been missing (or was he a soldier?  It was really hard to make out what was going on at times due to vague scenes and vague dialogue)  I'm sorry, I just didn't get it.And why in the world were they talking to Holly Hunter, a private attorney, about testifying in a murder trial which is presided over by the District Attorney's office?  That made NO SENSE, NO SENSE, NONSENSE.And Susan Sarandon stays with Dustin Hoffman because his body up against her butt at night in bed is &#34;home&#34; for her?  Uhhh . . . that's just weird.  Sure, fine -- fight like cats and dogs all day long and have little in common, but still you guys are 'soul mates.'",3,Sad film which does not realize its potential,1385769600,"11 30, 2013",2013,3785,"['many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'film', 'had', 'lot', 'potential', 'big', 'name', 'actors', 'interesting', 'story', 'premise', 'potential', 'educate', 'larger', 'public', 'realities', 'grief', 'ultimately', 'deliver', 'film', 'very', 'sad', 'hard', 'become', 'emotionally', 'involved', 'characters', 'even', 'people', 'marred', 'grief', 'act', 'too', 'weirdly', 'connect', 'with.First', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'people', 'are', 'cold', 'unemotional', 'do', 'not', 'really', 'seem', 'care', 'close', 'loved', 'one', 'just', 'died', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'stereotype', 'people', 'grief', 'look', 'obviously', 'sad', 'do', 'things', 'expect', 'sad', 'people', 'do', 'WRONG', 'especially', 'grief', 'new', 'shocking', 'daughter', 'getting', 'gunned', 'down', 'friendly', 'neighborhood', 'lunch', 'counter', 'street', 'office', 'where', 'daughter', 'hung', 'out', 'when', 'was', 'child', '8th', 'grade', 'girl', 'junior', 'high', 'where', 'once', 'served', 'substitute', 'teacher', 'was', 'raped', 'murdered', 'own', 'bed', 'neighbor', 'who', 'came', 'window', 'memorial', 'service', 'mother', 'looked', 'very', 'calm', 'serene', 'never', 'cried', 'smiled', 'people', 'shook', 'hands', 'did', 'not', 'look', 'grief', 'stricken', 'when', 'hugged', 'hung', 'drowning', 'person', 'grasping', 'lifeboat', 'could', 'tell', 'was', 'consumed', 'grief', 'Needless', 'say', 'did', 'not', 'appreciate', 'hearing', 'junior', 'high', 'kids', 'school', 'next', 'week', ""'dissing"", 'classmate', 'mother', 'talking', 'how', ""'obvious"", 'had', 'been', 'mother', 'had', 'not', 'cared', 'daughter', 'was', 'dead', 'be', 'sure', 'classes', 'had', 'several', 'intense', 'heart-to-heart', 'talks', 'paralyzing', 'realities', 'deep', 'inexpressible', 'grief', 'how', 'wrong', 'make', 'assumptions', 'someone', 'else', 'emotional', 'state.But', 'said', 'was', 'hard', 'connect', 'many', 'personality', 'characteristics', 'characters', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'character', 'fiancee', 'were', 'calling', 'off', 'wedding', 'why', 'did', 'not', 'tell', 'parents', 'together', 'especially', 'wedding', 'invitations', 'were', 'already', 'being', 'mailed', 'out', 'Why', 'did', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'character', 'not', 'even', 'CONSIDER', 'maybe', 'not-to-be', 'son-in-law', 'occupational', 'plans', 'might', 'change', 'light', 'daughter', 'murder', 'instead', 'charge', '34', 'full', 'steam', 'ahead', '34', 'pre-murder', 'plans', 'even', 'discussion', 'seemed', 'very', 'unrealistic', 'murdered', 'fiance', 'Diane', 'not', 'seem', 'someone', 'would', 'like', 'much', 'apparently', 'manipulated', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'character', 'agreeing', 'go', 'business', 'father', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'character', 'said', 'only', 'became', 'writer', 'order', 'please', 'daughter', 'way', 'weird', 'say', 'least', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'go', 'there', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'finding', ""'soul"", 'mate', 'only', 'few', 'weeks', 'Diane', 'murder', 'Yes', 'believable', 'would', 'REBOUND', 'bed', 'woman', 'grief', 'confusion', 'feelings', 'loneliness', 'abandonment', 'completely', 'unbelievable', 'relationship', 'would', 'be', 'real', 'permanent', 'what', 'up', 'woman', 'working', 'years', 'free', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'missing', 'was', 'soldier', 'was', 'really', 'hard', 'make', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'times', 'due', 'vague', 'scenes', 'vague', 'dialogue', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'it.And', 'why', 'world', 'were', 'talking', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'private', 'attorney', 'testifying', 'murder', 'trial', 'presided', 'District', 'Attorney', 'office', 'made', 'SENSE', 'NO', 'SENSE', 'NONSENSE.And', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'body', 'up', 'butt', 'night', 'bed', '34', 'home', '34', 'Uhhh', 'just', 'weird', 'Sure', 'fine', 'fight', 'cats', 'dogs', 'day', 'long', 'have', 'little', 'common', 'still', 'guys', 'are', ""'soul"", 'mates']",Moonlight Mile

Written and directed by Brad Silberling ('10 Items or Less') this little film is so genuine and beautifully crafted and acted that it seems odd that it has not become a cult classic in the art film houses.  The story melds tragedy with comic relief in such a successful way that it is truly a slice of life we all have or will encounter.  And offering a tough situation as played out by four characters in the end gives us all a sense of balance: bad things happen and pass and what is important is that we each 'find our home', our stable survival place.The film opens in a small town somewhere in the early part of the 1970s, the Vietnam war still a cloud that casts shadows on everyone.  Jojo and Ben Floss (Susan Sarandon and Dustin Hoffman) are preparing to wade through the uncomfortable aspects of their daughter Diana's funeral: Diana was accidentally killed in a cafe when an unknown man attempted to murder his wife over a family dispute.  Diana was to be married to Joe Nast (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Joe is in town for the wedding preparations and to reluctantly begin as Ben's partner in selling commercial real estate.  In what could be a morbid atmosphere Jojo vents her  just under the surface aggressions about how two-faced people are about mourning and funerals and burials. Somehow Jojo, Ben and Joe survive the day and Joe seems to be providing the stabilizing force by standing by his would-have-been parents-in-law.  The three of them meet with lawyer Mona (Holly Hunter) to prepare for the trial of the murderer, facing the fact that if convicted the murderer could face the death penalty and the judge would be asking the family for their input on that decision.Joe seeks distance from the situation, meets a pretty postal clerk Bertie (Ellen Pompeo) while attempting to prevent the wedding invitations to go out in the email: later Joe discovers the Bertie waits tables at Cal's Bar and Grill at night, a gesture of devotion to the owner/boyfriend Cal who has been missing for three years in Vietnam. The song 'Moonlight mile' connects the two needy people and they head toward a lighthearted but anxious mutual feeling of companionship.Meanwhile, Jojo has been unable to continue as a writer since Diana's death, Ben buries his emotions about losing his only child by concentrating on the new 'Floss & Son' realty company, and the couple argues about life in general and all but adopts Joe as their only compensation for the loss of their daughter.  Joe holds a secret: he broke off his engagement with Diana before the wedding - a fact that has many permutations to the actual incident in the cafe and the manner in which he feels Ben and Jojo will react to him.  How this revelation comes to light in the courtroom makes a unique impact on all concerned and Joe's steadfast truthfulness actually mends the lives of the Floss family and his own perception of his future.Silberling's script tackles many issues and does so with genuine pathos and compassion, creating wholly believable characters that are gratefully fleshed out by this extraordinary cast.  Susan Sarandon once again proves why she is one of our finest actresses on the screen today, while Gyllenhaal and Hoffman and Pompeo and Hunter match her every move.  The power of this film comes in the quiet moments, moments when we are reminded what makes relationships work, how we all need to find that special harbor we call home. An amazingly fine film!

602696,A2NBOL825B93OM,B00005JLOB,J R Zullo,"[0, 2]","""Moonlight mile"" is kind of an autobiographical movie by director Brad Silbering, who had previously directed ""City of angesl"" and tv series ""Felicity"" and ""NYPD blue"". So, he knows what to do to transport real emotions into the screen.When his fianc&eacute; is accidentaly shot and murdered a few days before their marriage, Joe's (Jake Gyllenhaal) life seems at a loose end: he's not sure he wants to live with her parents (Dustyn Hoffman and Susan Sarandon), and he won't be able to leave them. He decides to stick for a while to see what's going to happen next, and even with a huge guilt feeling, he's able to discover new things in town.""Moonlight mile"" is a movie about how to overcome a terrible loss. It's about people helping each other in any way they can, even if they're doing everythng wrong, but they're doing it because they love each other. And, what's most incredible, this movie, unlike ""In the bedroom"" (another terrific movie), which is about the same subject, has a positive and forward view of the matter. Silbering was able to give his characters (he's also the writer of the script) the three-dimension they needed to make a movie like this work. Excellent  performances by Hoffman and Sarandon unfortunately didn't get the attention they deserved. A good surprise (at least for me) were the two younger actors, Gyllehaal and Ellen Pompeo. This difficult movie seemed a walk in the park for them.""Moonlight mile"" is touching and interesting, and, at least concerning the characters' reactions, motives  and feelings, one of the best movies I've seen recently, even if there are some obvious scenes and sub-plots in the film.Grade 9.1/10",5,The forgetten movie of 2002,1049587200,"04 6, 2003",2003,1661,"['Moonlight', 'mile', 'kind', 'autobiographical', 'movie', 'director', 'Brad', 'Silbering', 'who', 'had', 'previously', 'directed', 'City', 'angesl', 'tv', 'series', 'Felicity', 'NYPD', 'blue', 'So', 'what', 'do', 'transport', 'real', 'emotions', 'screen.When', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'accidentaly', 'shot', 'murdered', 'few', 'days', 'marriage', 'Joe', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'life', 'loose', 'end', 'not', 'sure', 'live', 'parents', 'Dustyn', 'Hoffman', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'leave', 'stick', 'while', 'see', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'even', 'huge', 'guilt', 'feeling', 'able', 'discover', 'new', 'things', 'town', 'Moonlight', 'mile', 'movie', 'how', 'overcome', 'terrible', 'loss', 'people', 'helping', 'other', 'way', 'can', 'even', ""'re"", 'doing', 'everythng', 'wrong', ""'re"", 'doing', 'love', 'other', 'what', 'most', 'incredible', 'movie', 'bedroom', 'terrific', 'movie', 'same', 'subject', 'positive', 'forward', 'view', 'matter', 'Silbering', 'was', 'able', 'give', 'characters', 'also', 'writer', 'script', 'three-dimension', 'needed', 'make', 'movie', 'work', 'Excellent', 'performances', 'Hoffman', 'Sarandon', 'unfortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'attention', 'deserved', 'good', 'surprise', 'least', 'were', 'two', 'younger', 'actors', 'Gyllehaal', 'Ellen', 'Pompeo', 'difficult', 'movie', 'seemed', 'walk', 'park', 'Moonlight', 'mile', 'touching', 'interesting', 'least', 'concerning', 'characters', 'reactions', 'motives', 'feelings', 'one', 'best', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recently', 'even', 'are', 'obvious', 'scenes', 'sub-plots', 'film.Grade', '9.1/10']",Moonlight Mile

602698,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JLOB,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[0, 0]","Like many people my interest in seeing ""Moonlight Mile"" had as much to do with the fact writer-director Brad Silberling's story stems in part from the tragic murder of his girlfriend Rebecca Schaeffer as it does with the cast featuring a trio of Oscar winners in Dustin Hoffman, Susan Sarandon, and Holly Hunter.  However, it is not fair to characterize this film as a cathartic exercise on Silberling's part; the genesis for the film's story is more the relationship he shared with the parents of his girlfriend than her murder.  Those looking for strong parallels between fact and fiction will be disappointed, because the resonance of this film has to do with the relationship between young Joe Nast (Jake Gyllenhall) and the couple who were almost his in-laws, Ben (Hoffman) and JoJo Floss (Sarandon).  It is in trying to keep talking and to find ways of just functioning while they are overwhelmed by grief that we can convince ourselves Silberling is sharing with us ""truth"" about what it would be like to be in the shoes of such people.When ""Moonlight Mile"" begins it is three days after Diana Floss (Careena Melia) was shot in an ice cream shoppe across the street from her father's commercial reality office.  A guy walked in intending to gun down his wife; she received two bullets in the head but survived, while Diana was killed.  Now Joe finds himself living with Ben and JoJo trying to figure out what to do next.  Part of this is becoming Ben's partner in what will now be called ""Floss & Son,"" although commercial realty in a small New England economically depressed town in the early 1970s does not make much sense.  But Ben has lost a daughter and apparently now wants a son, while the tart tongued JoJo has stopped writing, and in the absence of a plan for his life Joe feels obligated to help them deal with their loss.Before we can decide what this movie is going to be about it takes a sudden turn.  Ben wakes up and realizes that he never stopped the printer from sending out the invitations to the wedding that is never going to happen and wants Joe to stop them from being mailed out (""It would just be too uncomfortable"").  Joe ends up at the old fashioned local post office where he meets Bertie Knox (Ellen Pompeo), who does not bat an eye at the idea of some strange guy walking into the place and wanting to pull 75 wedding invitations out of the mail.  Ben is attracted to Bertie; it is impossible not to be because this is one of the most captivating appearances of a young female character in a film (think Kate Hudson in ""Almost Famous"").  But then it dawns on us that Ben's fianc&eacute; was just brutally murdered a few days earlier.  Is Joe reaching out in his despair, incredibly shallow, or is there something else going on here?So, suddenly a film about three people trying to get beyond the death of someone they love is competing with a romance.  Do not worry, because eventually everything will make sense.  What confused me the most was that this was a period film, because that was not especially clear to me.  Why should the film be set in the early 1970s?  It has to be for a reason more than having a dog named Nixon.  But the Vietnam War comes into play because Bertie thinks Joe is a draft dodger at first (how else to explain why he is still in town) and more importantly because she also has lost someone: her boyfriend was declared M.I.A. in Vietnam three years earlier.  Joe has found something of a kindred spirit.""Moonlight Mile"" is not a great film, despite the stellar cast, mainly because the deep dark secret that is the film's ticking time bomb ends up smacking more of melodrama than tragedy.  It is one of those things that if you think about it rather than just accept it then the holes in the logic of it all become rather glaring.  Ultimately the film belongs not to Brad Silberling or his surrogate character Joe, but rather to that of Bertie.  It is rather amazing that Ellen Pompeo can steal this film from all those veteran actors with their Oscars.  But if you can create a character in performance where it makes perfect sense that someone who just buried their fianc&eacute; the day before could be smitten with a total stranger, then you have got to be impressed.  You can write what you want and do whatever with the lighting, but such magic can only be created by performance.  Sarandon is totally on target in her role, as is Hunter, but Pompeo provides the memorable performance in this film.",4,Brad Silberling's meditation on surviving a painful death,1048809600,"03 28, 2003",2003,4470,"['many', 'people', 'interest', 'seeing', 'Moonlight', 'Mile', 'had', 'much', 'do', 'fact', 'writer-director', 'Brad', 'Silberling', 'story', 'part', 'tragic', 'murder', 'girlfriend', 'Rebecca', 'Schaeffer', 'cast', 'featuring', 'trio', 'Oscar', 'winners', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'However', 'not', 'fair', 'characterize', 'film', 'cathartic', 'exercise', 'Silberling', 'part', 'genesis', 'film', 'story', 'more', 'relationship', 'shared', 'parents', 'girlfriend', 'murder', 'looking', 'strong', 'parallels', 'fact', 'fiction', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'resonance', 'film', 'do', 'relationship', 'young', 'Joe', 'Nast', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhall', 'couple', 'who', 'were', 'almost', 'in-laws', 'Ben', 'Hoffman', 'JoJo', 'Floss', 'Sarandon', 'trying', 'keep', 'talking', 'find', 'ways', 'just', 'functioning', 'are', 'overwhelmed', 'grief', 'can', 'convince', 'Silberling', 'sharing', 'truth', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'be', 'shoes', 'such', 'people.When', 'Moonlight', 'Mile', 'three', 'days', 'Diana', 'Floss', 'Careena', 'Melia', 'was', 'shot', 'ice', 'cream', 'shoppe', 'street', 'father', 'commercial', 'reality', 'office', 'guy', 'walked', 'intending', 'gun', 'down', 'wife', 'received', 'two', 'bullets', 'head', 'survived', 'Diana', 'was', 'killed', 'Now', 'Joe', 'living', 'Ben', 'JoJo', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'do', 'next', 'Part', 'becoming', 'Ben', 'partner', 'what', 'will', 'now', 'be', 'called', 'Floss', 'Son', 'commercial', 'realty', 'small', 'New', 'England', 'economically', 'depressed', 'town', 'early', '1970s', 'not', 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'Ben', 'lost', 'daughter', 'apparently', 'now', 'son', 'tart', 'tongued', 'JoJo', 'stopped', 'writing', 'absence', 'plan', 'life', 'Joe', 'feels', 'obligated', 'help', 'deal', 'loss.Before', 'can', 'decide', 'what', 'movie', 'going', 'be', 'sudden', 'turn', 'Ben', 'up', 'never', 'stopped', 'printer', 'sending', 'out', 'invitations', 'wedding', 'never', 'going', 'happen', 'Joe', 'stop', 'being', 'mailed', 'out', 'would', 'just', 'be', 'too', 'uncomfortable', 'Joe', 'up', 'old', 'fashioned', 'local', 'post', 'office', 'where', 'Bertie', 'Knox', 'Ellen', 'Pompeo', 'who', 'not', 'bat', 'eye', 'idea', 'strange', 'guy', 'walking', 'place', 'wanting', 'pull', '75', 'wedding', 'invitations', 'mail', 'Ben', 'attracted', 'Bertie', 'impossible', 'not', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'captivating', 'appearances', 'young', 'female', 'character', 'film', 'think', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'then', 'Ben', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'was', 'just', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'few', 'days', 'earlier', 'Joe', 'reaching', 'out', 'despair', 'incredibly', 'shallow', 'there', 'something', 'else', 'going', 'here', 'So', 'suddenly', 'film', 'three', 'people', 'trying', 'get', 'death', 'someone', 'love', 'competing', 'romance', 'Do', 'not', 'worry', 'eventually', 'everything', 'will', 'make', 'sense', 'What', 'confused', 'most', 'was', 'was', 'period', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'especially', 'clear', 'Why', 'should', 'film', 'be', 'set', 'early', '1970s', 'be', 'reason', 'more', 'having', 'dog', 'named', 'Nixon', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'play', 'Bertie', 'thinks', 'Joe', 'draft', 'dodger', 'first', 'how', 'else', 'explain', 'why', 'still', 'town', 'more', 'importantly', 'also', 'lost', 'someone', 'boyfriend', 'was', 'declared', 'M.I.A', 'Vietnam', 'three', 'years', 'earlier', 'Joe', 'found', 'something', 'kindred', 'spirit', 'Moonlight', 'Mile', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'stellar', 'cast', 'mainly', 'deep', 'dark', 'secret', 'film', 'ticking', 'time', 'bomb', 'up', 'smacking', 'more', 'melodrama', 'tragedy', 'one', 'things', 'think', 'rather', 'just', 'accept', 'then', 'holes', 'logic', 'become', 'rather', 'glaring', 'Ultimately', 'film', 'not', 'Brad', 'Silberling', 'surrogate', 'character', 'Joe', 'rather', 'Bertie', 'rather', 'amazing', 'Ellen', 'Pompeo', 'can', 'steal', 'film', 'veteran', 'actors', 'Oscars', 'can', 'create', 'character', 'performance', 'where', 'perfect', 'sense', 'someone', 'who', 'just', 'buried', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'day', 'could', 'be', 'smitten', 'total', 'stranger', 'then', 'have', 'got', 'be', 'impressed', 'can', 'write', 'what', 'want', 'do', 'lighting', 'such', 'magic', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'created', 'performance', 'Sarandon', 'totally', 'target', 'role', 'Hunter', 'Pompeo', 'memorable', 'performance', 'film']",Moonlight Mile

602700,A3SKGQSU29ZV80,B00005JLOB,Lleu Christopher,"[3, 4]","Moonlight Mile is a film that almost challenges cynical audiences to roll their eyes at a story that could easily become maudlin and entirely predictable. Good performances and a story that sometimes veers in unexpected directions prevents this from happening, if just barely.  Ben and JoJo (Dustin Hoffman and Susan Sarandon) are parents whose daughter has recently been murdered. Joe (Jake Gyllenhaal), who was about to marry the girl, moves in with the grieving parents. So far, this is a typical play-like scenario that promises a series of melodramatic and eventually tedious scenes. Movies that begin with the loss of a loved one are vehicles for stars to give performances that many critics will dutifully call &quot;Oscar worthy.&quot; The actors in this case do quite well with this material and manage to make the characters real people. Susan Sarandon always brings a certain intelligence and sophistication to her roles and this is no exception. It is easy to sympathize withJoJo's exasperation with &quot;well meaning&quot; neighbors. Hoffman, too, is a veteran who can usually be counted upon to bring something original to a character. Ben is a fairly complicated, and in some ways weak personality. He leans on his would-be son-in-law for support, pressuring him to enter a career in commercial real estate that the boy is obviously only lukewarm about. I could have done without the ultimately pointless parallels to The Graduate (Hoffman's character in that classic was also named Benjamin and Gyllenhaal's shyness and uncertainty are reminiscent of the Ben from that film). The movie is set in the 70s in a small New England town. One reason for using an earlier period is probably that today it would seem less likely that a young man would feel as much obligation to his in-laws as Joe does here. There are also some very good supporting roles. Holly Hunter is the prosecuting attorney who counsels the family on how to ensure that the girl's killer gets appropriately punished.

It is somewhat different from most other movies on this topic because it doesn't dwell only on the seriousness of the situation. It also sees the humor. The script is a bit underdeveloped and leaves us less attached to the characters than we would like to be.What truly makes the movie worth watching is the cast. It's a treat to watch Jake Gyllenhaal, one of the best actors of today's generation, playing opposite Dustin Hoffman and Susan Sarandon, two of the greatest actors of an older generation. [Holly Hunter is also present, but her supporting role doesn't require much of her formidable talent.]The movie opens in a small New England town as Joe [Gyllenhaal] is preparing to attend his fianc&eacute;e's funeral. She was killed in a local restaurant by a crazed gunman. JoJo and Ben [Sarandon and Hoffman] are the girl's parents, and Joe is staying in their home. The couple has virtually adopted Joe, who still intends to go into business with Ben, a commercial real estate developer. It's obvious that Ben doesn't really know JoJo and Ben very well. His decision to remain with them is motivated primarily by guilt. As the movie progresses, we come to know the reasons for that guilt. When he becomes attracted to a local girl [Pompeo], his bond with JoJo and Ben starts to unravel.The story takes place in the 1970s. The set design and art direction are reasonably faithful to the period.Of the performances, Gyllenhaal and Sarandon's are the strongest. Gyllenhaal's character is quite memorable. Sarandon is superb as the liberal atheist Jojo, who finds out that even a lack of faith is severely tested in times of emotional crisis.",4,Great acting dominates quirky tale of grief,1047772800,"03 16, 2003",2003,1739,"['Moonlight', 'Mile', 'quirky', 'semi-autobiographical', 'movie', 'how', 'people', 'deal', 'grief', 'somewhat', 'different', 'most', 'other', 'movies', 'topic', ""n't"", 'dwell', 'only', 'seriousness', 'situation', 'also', 'humor', 'script', 'bit', 'underdeveloped', 'less', 'attached', 'characters', 'would', 'like', 'truly', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'cast', 'treat', 'watch', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'one', 'best', 'actors', 'today', 'generation', 'playing', 'opposite', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'two', 'greatest', 'actors', 'older', 'generation', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'also', 'present', 'supporting', 'role', ""n't"", 'require', 'much', 'formidable', 'talent', ']', 'movie', 'small', 'New', 'England', 'town', 'Joe', '[', 'Gyllenhaal', ']', 'preparing', 'attend', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'funeral', 'was', 'killed', 'local', 'restaurant', 'crazed', 'gunman', 'JoJo', 'Ben', '[', 'Sarandon', 'Hoffman', ']', 'are', 'girl', 'parents', 'Joe', 'staying', 'home', 'couple', 'virtually', 'adopted', 'Joe', 'who', 'still', 'go', 'business', 'Ben', 'commercial', 'real', 'estate', 'developer', 'obvious', 'Ben', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'JoJo', 'Ben', 'very', 'well', 'decision', 'remain', 'motivated', 'primarily', 'guilt', 'movie', 'come', 'know', 'reasons', 'guilt', 'When', 'becomes', 'attracted', 'local', 'girl', '[', 'Pompeo', ']', 'bond', 'JoJo', 'Ben', 'unravel.The', 'story', 'place', '1970s', 'set', 'design', 'art', 'direction', 'are', 'reasonably', 'faithful', 'period.Of', 'performances', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Sarandon', 'are', 'strongest', 'Gyllenhaal', 'character', 'quite', 'memorable', 'Sarandon', 'superb', 'liberal', 'atheist', 'Jojo', 'who', 'out', 'even', 'lack', 'faith', 'severely', 'tested', 'times', 'emotional', 'crisis']",Moonlight Mile

602704,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B00005JLOB,mirasreviews,"[0, 1]","Moonlight Mile is a drama set in small town America in the early 1970's. Joe (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a young man whose finance, Diana, has recently died. JoJo and Ben (Susan Sarandon and Dustin Hoffman) are the deceased woman's grieving parents. Joe struggles to move beyond the emotional and material expectations which his broken engagement has left him to fulfill, trying not to disappoint his would-be in-laws while at the same time wanting to embark on a new life and a new relationship with a woman he has recently met. Joe, JoJo, and Ben each try to find ways to move past their loss and into the future, which may require acknowledging some unpleasant facts about the past.The performances of Susan Sarandon and Dustin Hoffman are top-notch as you would expect from such experienced thespians. Jake Gyllenhaal's performance is uneven.  His character, Joe, is an introverted man who speaks very little, so Gyllenhaal  often must communicate Joe's thoughts and emotional state with expressions alone. In some scenes he does a fine job of it; in others Joe's blank looks are conspicuous. On the other hand, Gyllenhaal does some very good work in scenes that have more dialogue. Susan Sarandon is on-target as JoJo, a plainspoken and somewhat overbearing woman who is trying to find her way back into life after the loss of her only child and finding that the emotional tools that she normally employs are not quite getting the job done. Dustin Hoffman plays Ben, JoJo's husband and father of the deceased, whose only immediate consolation for his daughter's death is found in an awkward relationship with his would-be son-in-law, Joe. Ellen Pompeo plays the part of Bertie, the woman with whom Joe finds new love. And Holly Hunter has a small part as the lawyer prosecuting the man who is responsible for Diane's death.My greatest criticism of this film is that it contains a courtroom scene in which a witness is allowed to launch unimpeded into a long, emotionally pivotal (and narratively helpful) monologue. Somehow I don't think such a thing would get very far in a courtroom without eliciting an objection. Chalk it up to artistic license, but that scene stuck out in what was otherwise a credible account of people searching for a way to move forward after experiencing great loss. The monologue itself is believable, but not in a courtroom. I recommend Moonlight Mile for its strong performances and the fact that it shows people dealing with the death of a loved one in what is ultimately a very functional manner. Moonlight Mile differs from In The Bedroom, a film that deals with similar issues, in that the directing style is not as melodramatic as In The Bedroom.",4,Imperfect but Poignant Portrait of a Family Coping with Loss,1047427200,"03 12, 2003",2003,2678,"['Moonlight', 'Mile', 'drama', 'set', 'small', 'town', 'America', 'early', '1970', 'Joe', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'young', 'man', 'finance', 'Diana', 'recently', 'died', 'JoJo', 'Ben', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'are', 'deceased', 'woman', 'grieving', 'parents', 'Joe', 'move', 'emotional', 'material', 'expectations', 'broken', 'engagement', 'left', 'fulfill', 'trying', 'not', 'disappoint', 'would-be', 'in-laws', 'while', 'same', 'time', 'wanting', 'embark', 'new', 'life', 'new', 'relationship', 'woman', 'recently', 'met', 'Joe', 'JoJo', 'Ben', 'try', 'find', 'ways', 'move', 'loss', 'future', 'may', 'require', 'acknowledging', 'unpleasant', 'facts', 'past.The', 'performances', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'are', 'top-notch', 'would', 'expect', 'such', 'experienced', 'thespians', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'performance', 'uneven', 'character', 'Joe', 'introverted', 'man', 'who', 'very', 'little', 'Gyllenhaal', 'often', 'must', 'communicate', 'Joe', 'thoughts', 'emotional', 'state', 'expressions', 'alone', 'scenes', 'fine', 'job', 'others', 'Joe', 'blank', 'looks', 'are', 'conspicuous', 'other', 'hand', 'Gyllenhaal', 'very', 'good', 'work', 'scenes', 'have', 'more', 'dialogue', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'on-target', 'JoJo', 'plainspoken', 'somewhat', 'overbearing', 'woman', 'who', 'trying', 'find', 'way', 'back', 'life', 'loss', 'only', 'child', 'finding', 'emotional', 'tools', 'normally', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'getting', 'job', 'done', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Ben', 'JoJo', 'husband', 'father', 'deceased', 'only', 'immediate', 'consolation', 'daughter', 'death', 'found', 'awkward', 'relationship', 'would-be', 'son-in-law', 'Joe', 'Ellen', 'Pompeo', 'part', 'Bertie', 'woman', 'whom', 'Joe', 'new', 'love', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'small', 'part', 'lawyer', 'prosecuting', 'man', 'who', 'responsible', 'Diane', 'death.My', 'greatest', 'criticism', 'film', 'courtroom', 'scene', 'witness', 'allowed', 'launch', 'unimpeded', 'long', 'emotionally', 'pivotal', 'narratively', 'helpful', 'monologue', 'Somehow', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'such', 'thing', 'would', 'get', 'very', 'far', 'courtroom', 'eliciting', 'objection', 'Chalk', 'up', 'artistic', 'license', 'scene', 'stuck', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'otherwise', 'credible', 'account', 'people', 'searching', 'way', 'move', 'forward', 'experiencing', 'great', 'loss', 'monologue', 'believable', 'not', 'courtroom', 'recommend', 'Moonlight', 'Mile', 'strong', 'performances', 'fact', 'people', 'dealing', 'death', 'loved', 'one', 'what', 'ultimately', 'very', 'functional', 'manner', 'Moonlight', 'Mile', 'differs', 'Bedroom', 'film', 'similar', 'issues', 'directing', 'style', 'not', 'as', 'melodramatic', 'Bedroom']",Moonlight Mile

Silberling ended up bonding with her parents and it is this experience that has brought to the screen for Moonlight Drive.The story is exceptionally well done. The dialogue is sublime. The acting is on top form with all involved. It does have its faults but when all is said and done this is actually a very enjoyable little drama. The situation is simple. Jake Gyllenhaal, playing Joe Nast, is staying at the home of his dead fianc&eacute;'s parents - Dustin Hoffman, playing Ben Floss, a real estate businessman, and Susan Sarandon, playing Jojo Floss, Ben's wife and a novelist with writer's block who are trying hard to come to terms with their child's murder and a looming trial that is about to cause them a great deal of stress, as their lawyer - Holly Hunter, playing Mona Camp, constantly informs them. Joe is given errands to run for Ben in the small local town and soon befriends a girl who works in the post office and who has a strange background. Joe has a dark secret that he is afraid to tell the Floss's. Ben thinks he may have been somehow responsible for his child's death. He is trying to start a business with Joe in town to try and deal with his grief but a broken window nearly drives him around the bend. JoJo suspects that there is something wrong with Joe but does not know what. JoJo is torn between these worlds and does not know what to do. The trial date looms as the family try to hold themselves together.The drama is really in the deep conversations and funny moments that the film brings, however it does drift into sentimentality too often and certainly the love subplot needs a little polishing and some loose ends are never really fixed. For all intensive purposes though if you like to watch good drama with an interesting premise, some great dialogue and some really interesting acting then Moonlight Mile certainly delivers. If you pick this one up from the shelf you are certainly not going wrong.

Two words: Cop Rock.Thus, Moonlight Mile came as something of a surprise; Silberling's first truly good flick. Much of this has to do with the amazing cast. How on earth Silberling, who also wrote the autobiographical script, managed to sign such incredible talent on the strength of his previous career is utterly beyond me. But then, stranger things have happened.Joe Nast (the brilliant Jake Gyllenhaal, fresh off cult-favorites Donnie Darko and Bubble Boy) is living with the parents of his fiancee after her murder in a diner shooting (she was an innocent bystander). Her parents, Ben (Dustin Hoffman) and Jojo (Susan Sarandon) are understandably devastated, and latch onto Joe as something of a replacement kid. Joe is desperately confused about everything. Until, that is, he meets Bertie (Ellen Pompeo, recently found in Daredevil, unfortunately for her) and finds himself deeply attracted to her. Meanwhile, he's being taken on as a partner in Ben's commercial property business, which is trying to buy a bar at which Bertie moonlights, in order to pave the way for a big development envisioned by the movie's evil overlord, Mulcahey (Dabney Coleman). The parents have brought a civil suit against the shooter, and have a parasitic attorney (Holly Hunter) who's looking to make a name for herself with this case. And Joe's also holding onto his own secrets, which could send them all spinning out of control.Everyone, and I mean everyone, in this film gives a top-notch performance. Gyllenhaal's speech at the trial is almost as good as the ""smurf sex"" rant in Donnie Darko. Hoffman, whose career has been on a gradual downward slide for years, returns to the form that held him in such good stead before, and including, Marathon Man. Even the normally unwatchable Sarandon turns in her best performance since The Hunger. Hunter turns in a rare excellent performance (she hasn't been this good since, probably not coincidentally, The Firm; she reprises Gary Busey's role here), and a raft of minor characters turning in star-quality performances help the whole thing hold together.As should be obvious from the plot synopsis, this ain't your normal romance. But then, Jake Gyllenhaal's presence in any flick seems to indicate it's not going to be your normal whatever (Donnie Darko was not your normal teen comedy, Highway was not your normal road flick, etc.). Moonlight Mile may be a chick flick, but it's like someone crossed the script for a chick flick with the script for a David Lynch film, then hit the puree button on the blender. The end result is twisted and wonderful. Definitely worth a rental. *** ",4,Gyllenhaal shines-- again.,1086566400,"06 7, 2004",2004,2851,"['Moonlight', 'Mile', 'Brad', 'Silberling', '2002', 'Brad', 'Silberling', 'had', 'rather', 'long', 'completely', 'undistinguished', 'Hollywood', 'career', 'Aside', 'helming', 'City', 'Angels', 'one', 'most', 'useless', 'remakes', 'time', 'did', 'lot', 'TV', 'work', 'Two', 'words', 'Cop', 'Rock.Thus', 'Moonlight', 'Mile', 'came', 'something', 'surprise', 'Silberling', 'first', 'truly', 'good', 'flick', 'Much', 'do', 'amazing', 'cast', 'How', 'earth', 'Silberling', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'autobiographical', 'script', 'managed', 'sign', 'such', 'incredible', 'talent', 'strength', 'previous', 'career', 'utterly', 'then', 'stranger', 'things', 'have', 'happened.Joe', 'Nast', 'brilliant', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'fresh', 'cult-favorites', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'Bubble', 'Boy', 'living', 'parents', 'fiancee', 'murder', 'diner', 'shooting', 'was', 'innocent', 'bystander', 'parents', 'Ben', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Jojo', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'are', 'understandably', 'devastated', 'latch', 'onto', 'Joe', 'something', 'replacement', 'kid', 'Joe', 'desperately', 'confused', 'everything', 'Bertie', 'Ellen', 'Pompeo', 'recently', 'found', 'Daredevil', 'unfortunately', 'deeply', 'attracted', 'Meanwhile', 'being', 'taken', 'partner', 'Ben', 'commercial', 'property', 'business', 'trying', 'buy', 'bar', 'Bertie', 'moonlights', 'order', 'pave', 'way', 'big', 'development', 'envisioned', 'movie', 'evil', 'overlord', 'Mulcahey', 'Dabney', 'Coleman', 'parents', 'have', 'brought', 'civil', 'suit', 'shooter', 'have', 'parasitic', 'attorney', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'who', 'looking', 'make', 'name', 'herself', 'case', 'Joe', 'also', 'holding', 'own', 'secrets', 'could', 'send', 'spinning', 'control.Everyone', 'mean', 'everyone', 'film', 'top-notch', 'performance', 'Gyllenhaal', 'speech', 'trial', 'almost', 'as', 'good', 'smurf', 'sex', 'rant', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'Hoffman', 'career', 'been', 'gradual', 'downward', 'slide', 'years', 'returns', 'form', 'held', 'such', 'good', 'stead', 'including', 'Marathon', 'Man', 'Even', 'normally', 'unwatchable', 'Sarandon', 'best', 'performance', 'Hunger', 'Hunter', 'rare', 'excellent', 'performance', ""n't"", 'been', 'good', 'probably', 'not', 'coincidentally', 'Firm', 'Gary', 'Busey', 'role', 'here', 'raft', 'minor', 'characters', 'turning', 'star-quality', 'performances', 'help', 'whole', 'thing', 'hold', 'together.As', 'should', 'be', 'obvious', 'plot', 'synopsis', 'ai', ""n't"", 'normal', 'romance', 'then', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'presence', 'flick', 'indicate', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'normal', 'whatever', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'was', 'not', 'normal', 'teen', 'comedy', 'Highway', 'was', 'not', 'normal', 'road', 'flick', 'etc.', 'Moonlight', 'Mile', 'may', 'be', 'chick', 'flick', 'someone', 'crossed', 'script', 'chick', 'flick', 'script', 'David', 'Lynch', 'film', 'then', 'hit', 'puree', 'button', 'blender', 'end', 'result', 'twisted', 'wonderful', 'Definitely', 'rental', '***']",Moonlight Mile

602712,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,B00005JLOB,Westley,"[1, 3]","""Moonlight Mile"" has many terrific elements, which makes it so frustrating that it isn't better.  First, the cast (Susan Sarandon, Jake Gyllenhall, & Dustin Hoffman) is truly first-rate.  Individually, these actors do some very good work in this movie; however, their styles/characters never click.  Hoffman plays distraught; Sarandon plays emotionally aloof and sarcastic (much like her character in ""Igby Goes Down""); Gyllenhall plays earnest (much like his character in ""The Good Girl"").  Second, the movie has some genuine texture.  It's set in some older neighborhoods of Glouster (MA), so it feels less generic than most dramas.  It reminded me a bit of movies based on books by Michael Chabon or Richard Russo (e.g., Nobody's Fool, The Wonder Boys).  Plus, much of the dialogue and characters are quirky.  However, the quirkiness never really pays off and sometimes distracts from the drama.Srandon and Hoffman play a couple whose daughter is tragically killed soon before her planned wedding to Gyllenhall.  The couple deal with her death in a number of ways, and Gyllenhall moves in and becomes part of the family.  Unfortunately, that's pretty much all you know about these people.  Their grief and emotions are not given any context.  The tone of the entire movie is also inconsistent.  At times, the characters come across as aloof and cynical, and then they rather unexpectedly have an emotional epiphany and catharsis.  Again, given all the positive elements of the movie, the lack of cohesion is disappointing.  Overall, this movie provides some moments of clarity about the process of grief.  However, ""Moonlight Mile"" never truly comes together to form a cohesive whole, resulting in some maudlin moments.",3,Just Misses the Mark,1053129600,"05 17, 2003",2003,1722,"['Moonlight', 'Mile', 'many', 'terrific', 'elements', 'so', 'frustrating', ""n't"", 'better', 'First', 'cast', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhall', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'truly', 'first-rate', 'Individually', 'actors', 'do', 'very', 'good', 'work', 'movie', 'however', 'styles/characters', 'never', 'click', 'Hoffman', 'distraught', 'Sarandon', 'emotionally', 'aloof', 'sarcastic', 'much', 'character', 'Igby', 'Goes', 'Down', 'Gyllenhall', 'earnest', 'much', 'character', 'Good', 'Girl', 'Second', 'movie', 'genuine', 'texture', 'set', 'older', 'neighborhoods', 'Glouster', 'MA', 'less', 'generic', 'most', 'dramas', 'reminded', 'bit', 'movies', 'based', 'books', 'Michael', 'Chabon', 'Richard', 'Russo', 'e.g.', 'Nobody', 'Fool', 'Wonder', 'Boys', 'much', 'dialogue', 'characters', 'are', 'quirky', 'However', 'quirkiness', 'never', 'really', 'sometimes', 'distracts', 'drama.Srandon', 'Hoffman', 'play', 'couple', 'daughter', 'tragically', 'killed', 'soon', 'planned', 'wedding', 'Gyllenhall', 'couple', 'deal', 'death', 'number', 'ways', 'Gyllenhall', 'becomes', 'part', 'family', 'Unfortunately', 'pretty', 'much', 'know', 'people', 'grief', 'emotions', 'are', 'not', 'given', 'context', 'tone', 'entire', 'movie', 'also', 'inconsistent', 'times', 'characters', 'come', 'aloof', 'cynical', 'then', 'rather', 'unexpectedly', 'have', 'emotional', 'epiphany', 'catharsis', 'Again', 'given', 'positive', 'elements', 'movie', 'lack', 'cohesion', 'disappointing', 'Overall', 'movie', 'moments', 'clarity', 'process', 'grief', 'However', 'Moonlight', 'Mile', 'never', 'truly', 'together', 'form', 'cohesive', 'whole', 'resulting', 'maudlin', 'moments']",Moonlight Mile
