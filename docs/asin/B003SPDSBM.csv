It's like their was another series that was about to begin but I guess it never happened. Other than that, great music, very few panty-shots, and a lot of action with just a blood scenes but not much to describe as gruesome. Their are some questions that really never get answered in the end, but that's the only downside for this anime. Other than that, it's well worth the buy.

1361586,ANQDMB1WUCEPK,B003SPDSBM,anothvortex,"[0, 1]","I went into this series with high hopes. Characters who can manipulate the elements are a personal favorite meme of mine, and this had the makings of an excellent example of the genre. You have the outcast who overcame his own limitations, only to return to the shores that scorned him to seek closure.  Then there is the spoiled princess who took his legacy and made it her own, despite a relative lack of brains and power upon their reunion. Set in a backdrop of monsters and family politics, what's not to love?As it turns out, that ends up being quite a bit.Oh, the first story arc is rather grand, and a couple of the secondary plot lines are quite interesting, but as the series progresses you feel like several pieces of information have been ignored or underdeveloped on purpose. Whether this was due to a planned sequel that never materialized or lackluster story-boarding it's difficult to say.  But the end result is a number or excellent characters and mythos that just do not reach their full potential.If you are looking for reasonable Anime that will intrigue you without having the strength to draw you in, this series is worth the investment. But please, don't expect the depth of other more iconic titles like Cowboy Bebop or Escaflowne. You'll only end up disappointed.I have heard that the original story was both darker in the original source materials, a series of light novels, and left incomplete with the death of the author. The fact that these novels are not translated, to the best of my knowledge, and will not be completed is a crying shame.

1361590,A2V0P9FMG2996Y,B003SPDSBM,Cassandra (The Huge Anime Fan),"[8, 12]","Full, non-spoiler review courtesy at ~ Book & Movie Dimension a Blog ~In this anime is Kazuma Kannagi is out for revenge. Due to past events, he lost his lover and when he did he pledged his allegiance to gain power. Kazuma was originally a son of the Kannagi family of who had strong powers connected to ""Enjutsu"" but which he was lacking in. His family wanted him to manifest the Enraiha or  Blaze Lightning Supremacy sword but couldn't so he was shunned. This flame has the strangest power. Most manifest the fire power but only a few. Kazuma didn't manifest your average at all. So he was completely helpless when his lover was in danger. Now after he's amassed power he's seeking the person responsible for her death. Just as he's sitting in motion and planning to avenge Tsui-Ling, he encounters Ayano Kannagi who is a distant family relative. Though despises him at first she also seems to slowly get along with him when realizing there is more to than everyone sees. And it becomes obvious she has romantic feelings toward him as well. Although her family wants forget together for social status while she doesn't want to have any of that.  Ayano is definitely a willful person and the carrier of the Enraiha. So some heavy arguments ensue where we further encounter connections between various mages who wield magic from fire, earth, and wind.Kaze No Stigma, Kazuma's Eyes turn Azure blue (referred to as The Stigma of the Wind) when he uses his wind powersThe ending for Kaze No Stigma was one that didn't capture a whole resolution but rather closure for mostly. It's obvious carries a lot of hate and guilt over 's death, so with the ending of the anime he gets some peace. Kaze No Stigma is much more invested in its characters that its plot development.Throughout the anime it seems fights against various opponents which are entertaining to see. If just for their quirky personalities and their pursue to find answers to the perpetrator of Tsui-Ling's (Kazuma's lover) demise. Your sure to get moments of being a real baddass from Kazuma against his enemies and displaying his unique wind stigma or ""F'jutsu"" (using the wind) which he obtained from The Wind Spirit King after feeling for a time he had to gain his own power after his family saw him as useless. If you enjoy power displays ,then you will enjoy watching Kaze No Stigma. The animation is very colorful and bright and found not entirely unique in any particular way except a little. In terms of anime animation it's just a bit expected but the actual characters are of course one-of-a-kind. The animation is just alright. It doesn't really jump out as being particular special like Blood +, Bleach, Gilgamesh, Code Geas: Lelouch of the Rebellion , and or say Speed Grapher.Almost entirely a watch if you love anime to that of Bleach and or Code Geass.Yes, meaning power plays where the main characters triumph over their enemies quite gloriously. For me it was quite intriguing throughout since Bleach is one of my favorite animes.Genre: Action/Adventure, Comedy, Drama, Fantasy, RomanceContains: Dark side, Developing PowersAnime Soundtrack Side-note: The Opening Theme song is ""Blast of Wind"" by Saori Kiuji and fits perfectly to the anime.The Ending Theme songs of which there are two but only one Op  are ""Hitorikiri no Sora"" by Saori Kiuji and the second ending theme is ""Matataki no Kiwoku"" by Ayumi Fujimura which found not to awful but not fantastic. The Opening in my opinion is so much better but to each his own.",5,Kazuma Kannagi is out for revenge,1334880000,"04 20, 2012",2012,3501,"['Full', 'non-spoiler', 'review', 'courtesy', '~', 'Book', 'Movie', 'Dimension', 'Blog', '~In', 'anime', 'Kazuma', 'Kannagi', 'out', 'revenge', 'Due', 'past', 'events', 'lost', 'lover', 'when', 'did', 'pledged', 'allegiance', 'gain', 'power', 'Kazuma', 'was', 'originally', 'son', 'Kannagi', 'family', 'who', 'had', 'strong', 'powers', 'connected', 'Enjutsu', 'was', 'lacking', 'family', 'wanted', 'manifest', 'Enraiha', 'Blaze', 'Lightning', 'Supremacy', 'sword', 'could', ""n't"", 'so', 'was', 'shunned', 'flame', 'strangest', 'power', 'Most', 'manifest', 'fire', 'power', 'only', 'few', 'Kazuma', 'did', ""n't"", 'manifest', 'average', 'was', 'completely', 'helpless', 'when', 'lover', 'was', 'danger', 'Now', 'amassed', 'power', 'seeking', 'person', 'responsible', 'death', 'Just', 'sitting', 'motion', 'planning', 'avenge', 'Tsui-Ling', 'Ayano', 'Kannagi', 'who', 'distant', 'family', 'relative', 'despises', 'first', 'also', 'slowly', 'get', 'when', 'realizing', 'more', 'everyone', 'sees', 'obvious', 'romantic', 'feelings', 'as', 'well', 'family', 'forget', 'together', 'social', 'status', ""n't"", 'want', 'have', 'Ayano', 'definitely', 'willful', 'person', 'carrier', 'Enraiha', 'heavy', 'arguments', 'ensue', 'where', 'further', 'encounter', 'connections', 'various', 'mages', 'who', 'wield', 'magic', 'fire', 'earth', 'Stigma', 'Kazuma', 'Eyes', 'turn', 'Azure', 'blue', 'referred', 'Stigma', 'Wind', 'when', 'wind', 'powersThe', 'ending', 'Kaze', 'No', 'Stigma', 'was', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'capture', 'whole', 'resolution', 'rather', 'closure', 'mostly', 'obvious', 'lot', 'hate', 'guilt', 'death', 'so', 'ending', 'anime', 'peace', 'Kaze', 'No', 'Stigma', 'much', 'more', 'invested', 'characters', 'plot', 'anime', 'fights', 'various', 'opponents', 'are', 'entertaining', 'see', 'just', 'quirky', 'personalities', 'pursue', 'find', 'answers', 'perpetrator', 'Tsui-Ling', 'Kazuma', 'lover', 'demise', 'sure', 'get', 'moments', 'being', 'real', 'baddass', 'Kazuma', 'enemies', 'displaying', 'unique', 'wind', 'stigma', ""F'jutsu"", 'using', 'wind', 'obtained', 'Wind', 'Spirit', 'King', 'feeling', 'time', 'had', 'gain', 'own', 'power', 'family', 'saw', 'useless', 'enjoy', 'power', 'displays', 'then', 'will', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'Kaze', 'No', 'Stigma', 'animation', 'very', 'colorful', 'bright', 'found', 'not', 'entirely', 'unique', 'particular', 'way', 'little', 'terms', 'anime', 'animation', 'just', 'bit', 'expected', 'actual', 'characters', 'are', 'course', 'one-of-a-kind', 'animation', 'just', 'alright', ""n't"", 'really', 'jump', 'out', 'being', 'particular', 'special', 'Blood', '+', 'Bleach', 'Gilgamesh', 'Code', 'Geas', 'Lelouch', 'Rebellion', 'say', 'Speed', 'Grapher.Almost', 'entirely', 'watch', 'love', 'anime', 'Bleach', 'Code', 'Geass.Yes', 'meaning', 'power', 'plays', 'where', 'main', 'characters', 'triumph', 'enemies', 'quite', 'gloriously', 'was', 'quite', 'intriguing', 'Bleach', 'one', 'favorite', 'animes.Genre', 'Action/Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Dark', 'side', 'Developing', 'PowersAnime', 'Soundtrack', 'Side-note', 'Opening', 'Theme', 'song', 'Blast', 'Wind', 'Saori', 'Kiuji', 'perfectly', 'anime.The', 'Ending', 'Theme', 'songs', 'are', 'two', 'only', 'one', 'Op', 'are', 'Hitorikiri', 'Sora', 'Saori', 'Kiuji', 'second', 'ending', 'theme', 'Matataki', 'Kiwoku', 'Ayumi', 'Fujimura', 'found', 'not', 'awful', 'not', 'fantastic', 'Opening', 'opinion', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'own']",Kaze No Stigma: The Complete Series

I originally saw this on Netflix, but ended up buying the DVD for my collection after enjoying it so much.There is a lot of your typical anime elements...boy & girl team with magical abilities fight demons. There is your obvious sides of good & evil in the story. However, as the story progresses we see many shades of gray with our main character Kazuma, and we have to start wondering if he is a good guy or not. Kozuma is in essence the prodigal son returning to a family he has broken off relations to. His backstory of what took place after exhile is revealed throughout the series, and we start to see his twisted path has not always looked pretty or heroic. Ayano is the good girl who has become heir to the family's power, although she is too immature & impetuous to be trusted in a position of authority as our story takes place. Kazuma has achieved great power on his own, and can easily defeat powerful opponents. He has a desire to prove it his old man & take him out in battle. Ayano has a lot to learn, but has an inner strength & optimism that Kazuma lacks. She is loyal to her family & trying to bring Kazuma back to a rational perspective on things. It is the interaction & character development between the two that made this stand out above other ""battling mages"" anime shows.It is a show that I could keep watching, but sadly the original author passed away a few years ago. Although much more story could be told, this anime does end at a good place that brings closure to the events depicted.

Its quite fast paced alot of good axction and comedy, the VA's did a superb job as always wich is what i expect from the cast of funamation. Also for the price ya cant go wrong so if ya want a light hearthed fast past action/comedy series u really cant go wrong,, now for the down side. The story is incomplete wich is a shame cause id like to seen where the creator was gonna take us.

1361600,A26TY6GCGBF5HT,B003SPDSBM,Graves,"[18, 19]","Kaze no stigma, mark of the wind, is an anime set in modern Japan and follows the adventures of the Kannagi family. The quality of the animation is good, the normal quality you'd expect but the writing and pacing of the series is what makes it really work.Members of the family are all supposed to be able to use fire magic and on occasion are called in to help the police with hiding occult menaces from the general public. The series starts with the return of lost son Kazuma who was cast out from the family for not being able to cast fire magic. On his return it is revealed he is one of the most powerful users of wind magic in the world with a personal in to the ruler of air magic. Although it would seem he is out for revenge on the family that disowned him Kazuma is really from the school of `living well is the best revenge' and seems like a nice guy. Kannagi family elders want him to develop a relationship with his cousin, the fiery tempered Ayanno, who is slated to take over the family some day, and so they often work together on missions. Added in is Kazuma's younger brother, Ren, who is a fire user but who never rejected his non-fire using brother and is delighted to have him back.Pretty standard stuff really for an anime. What makes this work is the pacing of the series. It does not follow a single  plot hook but follows the characters with adventures over time. Some adventures, a haunted high school, odd reports at an amusement park, are covered in a single episode but others can take 3 or more. The effect is the writers got to let things develop at a good pace rather than forcing the story into a set frame.Overall this is good solid fun anime. Story quality and world work in their setting and the characters are fun within their accepted roles. If you like anime this is a good one to go with, if you don't understand anime or you only think of things like Pokemon when you hear `anime' give this a look, it shows what can be done.",4,Good solid anime,1316131200,"09 16, 2011",2011,1966,"['Kaze', 'stigma', 'mark', 'wind', 'anime', 'set', 'modern', 'Japan', 'adventures', 'Kannagi', 'family', 'quality', 'animation', 'good', 'normal', 'quality', ""'d"", 'expect', 'writing', 'pacing', 'series', 'what', 'really', 'work.Members', 'family', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'able', 'use', 'fire', 'magic', 'occasion', 'are', 'called', 'help', 'police', 'hiding', 'occult', 'menaces', 'general', 'public', 'series', 'return', 'lost', 'son', 'Kazuma', 'who', 'was', 'cast', 'out', 'family', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'cast', 'fire', 'magic', 'return', 'revealed', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'users', 'wind', 'magic', 'world', 'personal', 'ruler', 'air', 'magic', 'would', 'seem', 'out', 'revenge', 'family', 'disowned', 'Kazuma', 'really', 'school', 'living', 'well', 'best', 'revenge', 'nice', 'guy', 'Kannagi', 'family', 'elders', 'want', 'develop', 'relationship', 'cousin', 'fiery', 'tempered', 'Ayanno', 'who', 'slated', 'take', 'over', 'family', 'day', 'so', 'often', 'work', 'together', 'missions', 'Added', 'Kazuma', 'younger', 'brother', 'Ren', 'who', 'fire', 'user', 'who', 'never', 'rejected', 'non-fire', 'using', 'brother', 'delighted', 'have', 'back.Pretty', 'standard', 'stuff', 'really', 'anime', 'What', 'work', 'pacing', 'series', 'not', 'follow', 'single', 'plot', 'hook', 'characters', 'adventures', 'time', 'adventures', 'haunted', 'high', 'school', 'odd', 'reports', 'amusement', 'park', 'are', 'covered', 'single', 'episode', 'others', 'can', 'take', '3', 'more', 'effect', 'writers', 'got', 'let', 'things', 'develop', 'good', 'pace', 'rather', 'forcing', 'story', 'set', 'frame.Overall', 'good', 'solid', 'fun', 'anime', 'Story', 'quality', 'world', 'work', 'setting', 'characters', 'are', 'fun', 'accepted', 'roles', 'like', 'anime', 'good', 'one', 'go', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'anime', 'only', 'think', 'things', 'Pokemon', 'when', 'hear', 'anime', 'give', 'look', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'done']",Kaze No Stigma: The Complete Series
1361601,AOQCMV497N2VH,B003SPDSBM,HappyBlushCalayapie,"[0, 3]","I bought it along with a bunch of other series like it around the same time on my birthday one year without knowing what they were like at all. This series was cheap, long, and had good reviews (I didn't read them so as to avoid spoilers, though), so I thought I'd get a large amount of series like this one so that i could get more for the little bit of money I had.Here's what I got out of the series:1. I've seen many animes before this, so I feel like I've seen this plot too many times.2. When they start to introduce new characters, they almost ALWAYS kill them off or send them away to never return after two episodes, so you aren't able to get attached to the characters (I liked that angel guy [who's name I forgot]. I wanted to get attached to him! Ugh...)3. The plot is all over the place. It starts out making it look like the whole plot will be about Kazuma eventually getting back with the family and all sorts of acceptance, but then I jumps from plot to plot. I felt like I was being thrown around, and it wasn't fun.4. I didn't really care for the opening or ending theme song (not the biggest problem, but I never really felt like stopping to watch either of them before or after any episode, which is something I do with songs I like very well).5. You don't feel attached to Tsui-Ling at all (you'll understand later. Not gonna spoil it).6. There were times where it tried to be a harem series, but abandoned the idea immediately.7. They threw in an annoying blonde from America as another love interest. Did I mention that she was annoying? At least they didn't keep that girl with the short hair...8. The only characters I actually liked were Ren and that girl Ren liked that _____________ (left a blank so as to hide spoilage).9. I liked how the head of the Kannagi family was secretly trying to get Kazuma and (forgot the red-head's name already even though I just finished the series yesterday) to have sex (it's funny). Also, my favorite episode was the one with the hotsprings episode (not because of the little bit of fanservice, but because Kazuma and his Dad were trying to kill each other the whole time which was super hilarious).10. Part of me liked AND hated how the two never actually kissed on the lips. It was creative how he would kiss almost anywhere but her lips, but to be honest, I didn't feel like they made a good couple. Neither of them go well with anybody!11. The last villain was very lackluster. I heard that the maker of this anime died which is why there's no more of it, but you're left wanting more. Part of me is upset that there's no more of it since many questions are just left hanging in the open, and the rest of me is glad because I don't have to waste my money on anymore of this series.12. There was only a smattering of pantyshots. Don't flame me! If they're going to add pantyshots, they should add more fanservice than that. The thing is is that the pantyshots didn't add anything to the series. It just turned it into a series that i knew I could never comfortably watch with my mom (not that I'd want to even if there wasn't any pantyshots. I did NOT enjoy this series well enough to re-watch it any time soon).13. This is the biggest problem: by the end of this series, I realized I never got attached to a single character in the series. Kazuma is invincible (with one weakness which he got over all-too-quickly) so he never had room to grow. That redhead (seriously, how did I forget her name?!) was just a random tsundere character. Sure, she didn't have much power, but since she's supposed to be the next Kannagi head of family, I feel like they messed up on that. They made her too weak!Fans of this show are gonna hate me for this review. Usually I don't rate animes so low. Normally my reviews are high, 4-5 star reviews (mostly five) but I just couldn't like the series. I tried. I honestly did.Since I'm a collector and I've had my hits and misses, I won't be sending it back. I want to own as much anime as I can, so I'll'll keep it anyway. I'm sure that there's some friends I can let borrow it that would enjoy such a series. I hope I enjoy the next series I watch more than this one.Also, this series would be rated 1 star, but I liked the onsen episode (super funny!) and Ren is adorable.",2,Not Really Sure Why This Is Popular...,1387324800,"12 18, 2013",2013,4270,"['bought', 'along', 'bunch', 'other', 'series', 'same', 'time', 'birthday', 'one', 'year', 'knowing', 'what', 'were', 'like', 'series', 'was', 'cheap', 'long', 'had', 'good', 'reviews', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'so', 'avoid', 'spoilers', 'though', 'thought', ""'d"", 'get', 'large', 'amount', 'series', 'one', 'i', 'could', 'get', 'more', 'little', 'bit', 'money', 'had.Here', 'what', 'got', 'out', 'series:1', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'animes', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'plot', 'too', 'many', 'times.2', 'When', 'start', 'introduce', 'new', 'characters', 'almost', 'ALWAYS', 'kill', 'off', 'send', 'away', 'never', 'return', 'two', 'episodes', 'are', ""n't"", 'able', 'get', 'attached', 'characters', 'liked', 'angel', 'guy', '[', 'who', 'name', 'forgot', ']', 'wanted', 'get', 'attached', 'Ugh', '3', 'plot', 'place', 'out', 'making', 'look', 'whole', 'plot', 'will', 'be', 'Kazuma', 'eventually', 'getting', 'back', 'family', 'sorts', 'acceptance', 'then', 'jumps', 'plot', 'plot', 'felt', 'was', 'being', 'thrown', 'was', ""n't"", 'fun.4', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'opening', 'ending', 'theme', 'song', 'not', 'biggest', 'problem', 'never', 'really', 'felt', 'stopping', 'watch', 'episode', 'something', 'do', 'songs', 'like', 'very', 'well', '.5', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'attached', 'Tsui-Ling', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'later', 'Not', 'gon', 'spoil', '.6', 'were', 'times', 'where', 'tried', 'be', 'harem', 'series', 'abandoned', 'idea', 'immediately.7', 'threw', 'annoying', 'blonde', 'America', 'love', 'interest', 'Did', 'mention', 'was', 'annoying', 'least', 'did', ""n't"", 'keep', 'girl', 'short', 'hair', '8', 'only', 'characters', 'actually', 'liked', 'were', 'Ren', 'girl', 'Ren', 'liked', '_____________', 'left', 'blank', 'so', 'hide', 'spoilage', '.9', 'liked', 'how', 'head', 'Kannagi', 'family', 'was', 'secretly', 'trying', 'get', 'Kazuma', 'forgot', 'red-head', 'name', 'already', 'even', 'just', 'finished', 'series', 'yesterday', 'have', 'sex', 'funny', 'Also', 'favorite', 'episode', 'was', 'one', 'hotsprings', 'episode', 'not', 'little', 'bit', 'fanservice', 'Kazuma', 'Dad', 'were', 'trying', 'kill', 'other', 'whole', 'time', 'was', 'super', 'hilarious', '.10', 'Part', 'liked', 'hated', 'how', 'two', 'never', 'actually', 'kissed', 'lips', 'was', 'creative', 'how', 'would', 'kiss', 'almost', 'anywhere', 'lips', 'be', 'honest', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'made', 'good', 'couple', 'go', 'well', 'anybody', '11', 'last', 'villain', 'was', 'very', 'lackluster', 'heard', 'maker', 'anime', 'died', 'why', 'more', ""'re"", 'left', 'wanting', 'more', 'Part', 'upset', 'more', 'many', 'questions', 'are', 'just', 'left', 'hanging', 'open', 'rest', 'glad', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'waste', 'money', 'anymore', 'series.12', 'was', 'only', 'smattering', 'pantyshots', 'Do', ""n't"", 'flame', ""'re"", 'going', 'add', 'pantyshots', 'should', 'add', 'more', 'fanservice', 'thing', 'pantyshots', 'did', ""n't"", 'add', 'anything', 'series', 'just', 'turned', 'series', 'i', 'knew', 'could', 'never', 'comfortably', 'watch', 'mom', 'not', ""'d"", 'want', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'pantyshots', 'did', 'NOT', 'enjoy', 'series', 'well', 'enough', 're-watch', 'time', 'soon', '.13', 'biggest', 'problem', 'end', 'series', 'realized', 'never', 'got', 'attached', 'single', 'character', 'series', 'Kazuma', 'invincible', 'one', 'weakness', 'got', 'all-too-quickly', 'never', 'had', 'room', 'grow', 'redhead', 'seriously', 'how', 'did', 'forget', 'name', 'was', 'just', 'random', 'tsundere', 'character', 'Sure', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'power', 'supposed', 'be', 'next', 'Kannagi', 'head', 'family', 'feel', 'messed', 'up', 'made', 'too', 'weak', 'Fans', 'show', 'are', 'gon', 'hate', 'review', 'Usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'rate', 'animes', 'so', 'low', 'Normally', 'reviews', 'are', 'high', '4-5', 'star', 'reviews', 'mostly', 'five', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'like', 'series', 'tried', 'honestly', 'did.Since', ""'m"", 'collector', ""'ve"", 'had', 'hits', 'misses', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'sending', 'back', 'want', 'own', 'as', 'much', 'can', 'so', ""I'll"", ""'ll"", 'keep', 'anyway', ""'m"", 'sure', 'friends', 'can', 'let', 'borrow', 'would', 'enjoy', 'such', 'series', 'hope', 'enjoy', 'next', 'series', 'watch', 'more', 'one.Also', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'rated', '1', 'star', 'liked', 'onsen', 'episode', 'super', 'funny', 'Ren', 'adorable']",Kaze No Stigma: The Complete Series

The box contains two slimline boxes, and each slimline box holds two DVDs.  The first slimline is labeled as ""Volume 1 - Wind,"" and the second slimline is labeled as ""Volume 2 - Fire.""  The first disc of each set contains seven episodes, while the second disc in each set contains five episodes and the extras.The second disc in the first slimline has three extras.  The first is labeled as ""Ayano's House Call: All-You-Can Eat Cakes.""  There are three parts to this extra, which are videos that run for approximately ten minutes each.  The videos feature the Japanese voice actors for the characters of Ayano, Yukari, and Nanase.  During these videos, you see them at a fan event and dinner, traveling through the streets of Kobe, and an ""early morning ambush"" at their hotel.  These videos include Japanese audio with English subtitles.  It appears that these three voice actresses had an Internet show they did in Japan that had a connection with Kaze no Stigma, and that these videos were filmed and originally included on the Japanese DVD releases of the series.  While I understand FUNimation wanting to include extras on this DVD release, I felt that including these videos on an American release was a bit of a stretch.  Since I've never seen this Internet show, it was a little hard for me to entirely understand what was going on.  This disc also contains ""Textless Songs.""  The songs included in this feature are the opening, as well as both of the ending credits songs that appear in the series.  The final extra on this disc is ""Trailers.""The second disc in the second slimline also has three extras.  The first is parts four through six of ""Ayano's House Call: All-You-Can Eat Cakes.""  All three of these parts focus on a ""Reflect on our Errors Meeting"" in Osaka.  All of the discussion that takes place in these parts deal with the aforementioned Internet show.  The ""Textless Songs"" are exactly the same as what appears on the other disc in this set that has extras.  The final extra is more trailers.Overall, I thought the series itself was actually quite good.  There was a bit of fanservice, especially in regards to a number of panty shots of Ayano; however, the fanservice really doesn't distract from the story being told in the series.  There is also some blood seen in the series, especially in some of the earlier episodes.  My one main complaint is the fact that the ending does feel a little rushed.  However, the buildup to the ending is worth going through.  I also appreciated how Kazuma's younger brother, Ren, was treated as much as a main character as Kazuma and Ayano.  Typically in anime, the ""cute"" younger siblings are relegated to supporting roles, so it was nice to see Ren break that stereotype.Personally, I would recommend Kaze no Stigma: The Complete Series to fans of the series, as well as to viewers who enjoy stories about magic users who can manipulate the elements.I wrote this review after watching a copy of this DVD set that my husband bought for me as a gift.",4,Fire and wind must work together in Kaze no Stigma,1314057600,"08 23, 2011",2011,3122,"['Kaze', 'Stigma', 'Complete', 'Series', 'four-disc', 'set', 'twenty-four', 'episodes', 'series', 'box', 'two', 'slimline', 'boxes', 'slimline', 'box', 'two', 'DVDs', 'first', 'slimline', 'labeled', 'Volume', '1', 'Wind', 'second', 'slimline', 'labeled', 'Volume', '2', 'Fire', 'first', 'disc', 'set', 'seven', 'episodes', 'second', 'disc', 'set', 'five', 'episodes', 'extras.The', 'second', 'disc', 'first', 'slimline', 'three', 'extras', 'first', 'labeled', 'Ayano', 'House', 'Call', 'All-You-Can', 'Eat', 'Cakes', 'are', 'three', 'parts', 'extra', 'are', 'videos', 'run', 'approximately', 'ten', 'minutes', 'videos', 'feature', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'actors', 'characters', 'Ayano', 'Yukari', 'Nanase', 'videos', 'see', 'fan', 'event', 'dinner', 'traveling', 'streets', 'Kobe', 'early', 'morning', 'ambush', 'hotel', 'videos', 'include', 'Japanese', 'audio', 'English', 'subtitles', 'three', 'voice', 'actresses', 'had', 'Internet', 'show', 'did', 'Japan', 'had', 'connection', 'Kaze', 'Stigma', 'videos', 'were', 'filmed', 'originally', 'included', 'Japanese', 'DVD', 'releases', 'series', 'understand', 'FUNimation', 'wanting', 'include', 'extras', 'DVD', 'release', 'felt', 'including', 'videos', 'American', 'release', 'was', 'bit', 'stretch', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Internet', 'show', 'was', 'little', 'hard', 'entirely', 'understand', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'disc', 'also', 'Textless', 'Songs', 'songs', 'included', 'feature', 'are', 'opening', 'as', 'well', 'ending', 'credits', 'songs', 'appear', 'series', 'final', 'extra', 'disc', 'Trailers', 'second', 'disc', 'second', 'slimline', 'also', 'three', 'extras', 'first', 'parts', 'four', 'six', 'Ayano', 'House', 'Call', 'All-You-Can', 'Eat', 'Cakes', 'three', 'parts', 'focus', 'Reflect', 'Errors', 'Meeting', 'Osaka', 'discussion', 'place', 'parts', 'deal', 'aforementioned', 'Internet', 'show', 'Textless', 'Songs', 'are', 'exactly', 'same', 'what', 'other', 'disc', 'set', 'extras', 'final', 'extra', 'more', 'trailers.Overall', 'thought', 'series', 'was', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'was', 'bit', 'fanservice', 'especially', 'regards', 'number', 'panty', 'shots', 'Ayano', 'however', 'fanservice', 'really', ""n't"", 'distract', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'series', 'also', 'blood', 'seen', 'series', 'especially', 'earlier', 'episodes', 'one', 'main', 'complaint', 'fact', 'ending', 'feel', 'little', 'rushed', 'However', 'buildup', 'ending', 'worth', 'going', 'also', 'appreciated', 'how', 'Kazuma', 'younger', 'brother', 'Ren', 'was', 'treated', 'as', 'much', 'main', 'character', 'Kazuma', 'Ayano', 'Typically', 'anime', 'cute', 'younger', 'siblings', 'are', 'relegated', 'supporting', 'roles', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'Ren', 'break', 'stereotype.Personally', 'would', 'recommend', 'Kaze', 'Stigma', 'Complete', 'Series', 'fans', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'viewers', 'who', 'enjoy', 'stories', 'magic', 'users', 'who', 'can', 'manipulate', 'elements.I', 'wrote', 'review', 'watching', 'copy', 'DVD', 'set', 'husband', 'bought', 'gift']",Kaze No Stigma: The Complete Series

After being defeated by his younger cousin, Ayano, his father banishes him from the house and he disappears. Four years later, he returns, now a skilled master of the wind arts, and he has changed his name to Kazuma Yagami. Now Kazuma and Ayano must team up to fight various sinister threats with their awesome ninja power.When I read the description of this series on AnimeNewsNetwork, I thought it sounded a little cliched, but fun. Then, as I started watching, I found I had been deceived. The synopsis paints Kazuma as the main character, but in actuality, it is Ayano. This means instead of a cool, rebellious, young man OUT of high school as the focus of the show - we get a pushy, hot tempered, and none too bright, Ayano, who is in high school. This change in focus kills anything interesting this show might have had. The plot is lame, the fire art Ayano has is boring, though Kazuma's wind art is kind of cool, it doesn't get much screen time. Ayano is a really flat character.On a bright note, yes this really is the entire series. It is the first, and only, season. The ending isn't very clean, but unfortunately, the author of the light novels Kaze no Stigma was based on died leaving it unfinished.Kaze no Stigma isn't bad, it is just not good either. I have watched lots of anime and have lost all patience with mediocre shows.If you haven't been exposed to much anime, and are looking for an action show with ninja powers, this would suit you just fine.

I literally got it because I liked the artwork on the box and it was a good deal for a full series. After it was all said and done I put the last dvd back in the box feeling pretty satisfied at my watching experience. I won't take you through all of the storyline details but here is the basic premise of the show. You have the Kannagi magic using family who has a son who can't use the family magic. He is basically exiled from the family, goes off and gains power ... We pick up when he arrives back in town and he reunites with his family members. From there we have family drama, plenty of action and a lot of laughs. The series really has the feel of a long 200+ ep. series condensed down to 24 episodes. The great thing is that it still plays out nice without feeling like it is rushed through. You get several different story arcs with a few elements that carry throughout to glue it all together. You have action arcs, character arcs, comedy arcs, and even the obligatory hot springs episode. It is not a fan-service oriented type episode, for those wondering. Pretty much, it has all of the various arcs a long series would contain. Each arc plays out nicely and in an amount of episodes that seems to flow well. The characters are all enjoyable and are voiced well for the most part. Watching the relationships between Kazuma, Ayano, and Ren mature was a strong part of the series for me which I enjoyed. The action sequences were also engaging and fun to watch ... nothing like watching some magic users kick some butt.
