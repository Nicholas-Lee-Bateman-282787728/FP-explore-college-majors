""Last House"" is a clumsily made mess that does not deserve the absurd accolades that it has received over the years.  For an example of skillfully made classic exploitation cinema, check out Craven's followup, ""The Hills Have Eyes,"" which shows that he was capable of learning from his mistakes.  And please don't pay attention to Craven or the dimwitted ""film scholars"" (Robin Wood, e.g.) who claim that ""Last House"" is a powerful statement about the Vietnam era (or somesuch nonsense), because it isn't: it's an inept attempt to create a ""calling-card"" trashfest, not a piece of profound social commentary.

This DVD version is great because it includes several scenes that were cut from the film over the years of it's release.  This most controversial film has been chopped to bits by theatre managers, video production companies, and censors.  Contained on this DVD are such infamous scenes as the ""disembowellment"" scene, the ""severed arm"" scene, and the scene where one of the murderers actually carves his name into the chest of his innocent teenage victim.  This version also gives you the story behind the nortorious ""Piss your pants"" scene and the scene where one of the killers gets his penis chewed off by the mother of his victim.  This DVD release also answers the question of ""Whatever happened to that actor/actress?"" with the extras.

There are scenes in this movie that makes you sympathize for the characters, such as the self urination scene and the scene where the two girls are forced to have sex with one another.  I believe those scenes struck me harder then the actual rape and murder.When these rapist find themselves at Mary's home, I actually found myself rooting the parents on, hoping they would find out what had been done to their daughter, and of course they figure it out.The revenge in this movie is great, especially with the castration and the chainsaw wailing father.  Due to the explicit nature of this film it is a cult classic that will always be known as perhaps one of the most brutal rape/revenge movies ever.If you have yet to see ""Last House"" buy it, but guys I wouldn't suggest showing this on the first date to your girl, unless she likes to see multiple rape and disembowelment.  In all honesty this movie could be used as a party movie as well, there are quite a few scenes regarding dry wit humor, and plenty of blood soaked sequences that would make the strongest flinch.",5,"A Disturbing Look into Rape, Murder, and Revenge",1233100800,"01 28, 2009",2009,1287,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'years', 'ago', 'thought', ""'d"", 'give', '2', 'cents', 'worth', 'remake', 'will', 'soon', 'be', 'released', 'Last', 'House', 'Left', 'was', 'probably', 'first', 'rape', 'film', 'ever', 'saw', 'low', 'budget', 'are', 'scenes', 'movie', 'sympathize', 'characters', 'such', 'self', 'urination', 'scene', 'scene', 'where', 'two', 'girls', 'are', 'forced', 'have', 'sex', 'one', 'believe', 'scenes', 'struck', 'harder', 'then', 'actual', 'rape', 'murder.When', 'rapist', 'find', 'Mary', 'home', 'actually', 'found', 'rooting', 'parents', 'hoping', 'would', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'had', 'been', 'done', 'daughter', 'course', 'figure', 'out.The', 'revenge', 'movie', 'great', 'especially', 'castration', 'chainsaw', 'wailing', 'father', 'Due', 'explicit', 'nature', 'film', 'cult', 'classic', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'known', 'perhaps', 'one', 'most', 'brutal', 'rape/revenge', 'movies', 'ever.If', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'Last', 'House', 'buy', 'guys', 'would', ""n't"", 'suggest', 'showing', 'first', 'date', 'girl', 'see', 'multiple', 'rape', 'disembowelment', 'honesty', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'used', 'party', 'movie', 'well', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'scenes', 'regarding', 'dry', 'wit', 'humor', 'plenty', 'blood', 'soaked', 'sequences', 'would', 'make', 'strongest', 'flinch']",N/A

156152,A2I4VTPKGSQZ75,079284632X,Anthony Hand,"[3, 3]","As a film about rape, murder and revenge, 'Last House on the Left' was always one of those movies that guaranteed a certain amount of controversy. Although received well enough in the States (albeit with some opposition), in Britain, Wes Craven's debut was doomed to be kicked around the censors and ended up being banned outright when it was submitted for classification in 1974. It was submitted again, two years later and again it was rejected.But, in the early 80's ""anything goes"" nature of video releases, Craven's film was unleashed upon the home video viewing public on VHS and Betamax. With only a comedy scene cut from its running time, which ironically made for a stronger overall film!Inevitably, 'Last House on the Left' was destined to become one of those infamous video nasties that made the rounds in Britain in the early 80's and two years after it was released on tape, it was pulled from the shelves in 1984 under the ""Video Nasties"" bill. In Britain, the film still courts controversy, while it goes uncensored in most parts of the world.However, upon viewing, one may wonder why its reputation is so infamous. There are certainly shocking scenes in the running time, but for the most part they remain somewhat muted. Especially when compared to other movies. In addition, the ""shocks"" are diluted incredibly by the ineptly handled comedy, which is really out of place here. It boggles the mind why Craven chose to lumber an otherwise tight script (ripped from Ingmar Bergman's 'The Virgin Spring') with such ill-conceived and unfunny ""humour"". Really, I cannot stress enough how bad the goofy scenes are. They just do not work on any level whatsoever and mar the project terribly.The basic script involving Phyllis (Lucy Grantham) and Mari's (Sandra Cassell) abduction and brutal treatment, coupled with the revenge of Phyllis' parents sufficed and would have made for a more powerful and rewarding film, if one likes such films. The cheap film stock and non-stars lend a certain realism to everything, but this is shattered by the insertion of screwball music and silly laughs. There is also no explanation of why Krug (David Hess) and his gang Fred (Fred Lincoln), Junior (Marc Sheffler) and Sadie (Jeramie Rain) are doing what they do, which is good and goes some way to increasing the senselessness of the two teenagers' unfortunate fate. The gang are a despicable bunch and for the most part remain convincing, with particularly menacing performances by Hess and Lincoln.A real ""grindhouse"" film, 'Last House on the Left' has inevitably lost most of its ""umph"" over the years. But, it still has that power to make the viewer uncomfortable. It's not the gross-out, shock-fest that you may have heard of, but it does leave the viewer with a slight disturbance after the credits have rolled and in an era where far too many films end with ""meh"", that's a good thing I suppose.Incidentally, viewers who enjoyed this may want to seek out David Hess playing pretty much the same role in Ruggero Deodato's 'The House on the Edge of the Park' and you should keep an eye out for Martin Kove, who plays the Deputy. You may recognise him as Detective Isbecki from 'Cagney and Lacey'.",3,House of Pain,1272412800,"04 28, 2010",2010,3198,"['film', 'rape', 'murder', 'revenge', 'House', 'Left', 'was', 'always', 'one', 'movies', 'guaranteed', 'certain', 'amount', 'controversy', 'received', 'well', 'enough', 'States', 'opposition', 'Britain', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'debut', 'was', 'doomed', 'be', 'kicked', 'censors', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'banned', 'outright', 'when', 'was', 'submitted', 'classification', '1974', 'was', 'submitted', 'again', 'two', 'years', 'later', 'again', 'was', 'rejected.But', 'early', '80', 'anything', 'nature', 'video', 'releases', 'Craven', 'film', 'was', 'unleashed', 'home', 'video', 'viewing', 'public', 'VHS', 'Betamax', 'only', 'comedy', 'scene', 'cut', 'running', 'time', 'ironically', 'made', 'stronger', 'overall', 'film', 'Inevitably', 'House', 'Left', 'was', 'destined', 'become', 'one', 'infamous', 'video', 'nasties', 'made', 'rounds', 'Britain', 'early', '80', 'two', 'years', 'was', 'released', 'tape', 'was', 'pulled', 'shelves', '1984', 'Video', 'Nasties', 'bill', 'Britain', 'film', 'still', 'controversy', 'uncensored', 'most', 'parts', 'world.However', 'viewing', 'one', 'may', 'wonder', 'why', 'reputation', 'so', 'infamous', 'are', 'certainly', 'shocking', 'scenes', 'running', 'time', 'most', 'part', 'remain', 'somewhat', 'muted', 'Especially', 'when', 'compared', 'other', 'movies', 'addition', 'shocks', 'are', 'diluted', 'incredibly', 'ineptly', 'handled', 'comedy', 'really', 'place', 'here', 'mind', 'why', 'Craven', 'chose', 'lumber', 'otherwise', 'tight', 'script', 'ripped', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', ""'The"", 'Virgin', 'Spring', 'such', 'ill-conceived', 'unfunny', 'humour', 'Really', 'can', 'not', 'stress', 'enough', 'how', 'bad', 'goofy', 'scenes', 'are', 'just', 'do', 'not', 'work', 'level', 'whatsoever', 'mar', 'project', 'terribly.The', 'basic', 'script', 'involving', 'Phyllis', 'Lucy', 'Grantham', 'Mari', 'Sandra', 'Cassell', 'abduction', 'brutal', 'treatment', 'coupled', 'revenge', 'Phyllis', 'parents', 'sufficed', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'powerful', 'rewarding', 'film', 'one', 'likes', 'such', 'films', 'cheap', 'film', 'stock', 'non-stars', 'lend', 'certain', 'realism', 'everything', 'shattered', 'insertion', 'screwball', 'music', 'silly', 'laughs', 'also', 'explanation', 'why', 'Krug', 'David', 'Hess', 'gang', 'Fred', 'Fred', 'Lincoln', 'Junior', 'Marc', 'Sheffler', 'Sadie', 'Jeramie', 'Rain', 'are', 'doing', 'what', 'do', 'good', 'way', 'increasing', 'senselessness', 'two', 'teenagers', 'unfortunate', 'fate', 'gang', 'are', 'despicable', 'bunch', 'most', 'part', 'remain', 'convincing', 'particularly', 'menacing', 'performances', 'Hess', 'Lincoln.A', 'real', 'grindhouse', 'film', 'House', 'Left', 'inevitably', 'lost', 'most', 'umph', 'years', 'still', 'power', 'make', 'viewer', 'uncomfortable', 'not', 'gross-out', 'shock-fest', 'may', 'have', 'heard', 'leave', 'viewer', 'slight', 'disturbance', 'credits', 'have', 'rolled', 'era', 'where', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'films', 'end', 'meh', 'good', 'thing', 'suppose.Incidentally', 'viewers', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'may', 'want', 'seek', 'out', 'David', 'Hess', 'playing', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'role', 'Ruggero', 'Deodato', ""'The"", 'House', 'Edge', 'Park', 'should', 'keep', 'eye', 'out', 'Martin', 'Kove', 'who', 'Deputy', 'may', 'recognise', 'Detective', 'Isbecki', ""'Cagney"", 'Lacey']",N/A

156154,A1PASRZ81DY9C,079284632X,Austin Somlo,"[1, 1]","Viewed: 10/07Rate: 310/07: Since I've been seeing some crappy horror films of today, the premise behind The Last House on the Left is very familiar. Wes Craven basically throws in sadism heavily handed to defile two young women in order to create a horror picture. Instead, the message behind The Last House on the Left is that raping women is fun. All I saw in the picture was glorification. I failed to see the horror aspect in The Last House on the Left but rather be insulted with the kind of thinking that Wes Craven presents. Judging on the production of The Last House on the Left, I thought the picture looked good but too off-beat. I couldn't get away from the fact how hammy the dialogue was, but to give credit, it was a lot better than The Hills Have Eyes. As for the characters, I thought all did a somewhat good job and did what they could do to make an effective picture, but they were one-dimensional at best. But, the idea behind The Last House on the Left didn't constitute a horror picture in my view. I mean, the film I saw before The Last House on the Left was Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer. For comparative purposes, Wes Craven comes away looking like a misguided wannabe. By his banner on The Last House on the Left's poster, it says ""It's only a movie...blah...blah"". Conveying that message was to dissuade the viewers from thinking that it was too frightening to think the movie was real. To be honest with you, I found the movie terribly boring to watch, let alone the terrifying feel (which was nil). Taken from wiki, it states, ""The film split opinion with critics, unsure whether the film is a bold artistic statement or exploitative trash, or some combination of the two. Audiences, however, flocked to see the film and, along with films such as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, it is credited with bringing a new sense of realistic violence to the modern horror film genre."" Ahh, interesting...does that mean somebody behind The Last House on the Left actually committed the similar crimes and/or perhaps had a first-hand experience of it? Why is it so important to create a film like The Last House on the Left and leave the victims, especially raped females, feeling lastingly awful? Some say that the rape scene in The Last House on the Left was the worst put in a film; well, that's not true. As a matter of fact, there's hardly any vision of rape in it. Death Wish 3 blows the doors off of The Last House on the Left when it comes to rape. Some say that The Last House on the Left is a masterpiece. Yeah, of course, they probably are too sick to realize that they are too far removed from society to discern between right and wrong. Wes Craven is one of them. Gee whiz, how did this man manage to make films again and again? The only impressive film in his resume is Scream while nearly everything else he did was trivially boring and amateurish, failing to meet the idea of what a ""horror film"" is. Anyone in the world can make The Last House on the Left. All they have to do is get a couple of girls who will be willingly to cooperate with the rape scenes and earn the money. What saved me in The Last House on the Left is my suspicion of the young cop until I was reaffirmed in the ending credits that it was actually Martin Kove. Dang, he looked boyishly young. The title The Last House on the Left had me thinking: ""Why is it called that way?"" Surely, if you were going this way, it would be like....the first house on the right.

It's reputation for raw brutality and uninhibited violence still stands 30 years after the movie being made. ""Last House On The Left"" is one of those movies you enjoy, even though the probably shouldn't.""Last House On The Left"" follows the standard revenge formula, in which two teenagers are murdered, and the parents execute a terrible revenge on the killers. The characters are surprisingly well developed, considering that characters in movies like this usually exist for the sole purpose of dying a bloody death. The cast contains largely unknown actors who had little subsequent success after ""Last House On The Left"", and as the commentary suggests, this movie might have been the reason for that.  ""Last House On The Left"" looks like what it is, an ambitious amateur movie, which tried hard to push the envelope, and succeeded. The acting and writing is all amateur night, and there are areas where the movie suffers from ill-timed humor. The police characters were totally unnecessary, and only adds screwball, ""Dukes of Hazzard"" style comedy where it is neither needed nor wanted. One thing I will give kudos for is the music score, which is the best example of juxtaposition I have seen in a horror movie. Watch it and you'll see what I mean.This is the closest thing to the completed version that has ever been released. The original cut ran 91 minutes, but with much of the scenes edited out to meet the sensitivities of the public at large, and much of the audio for the cut scenes being lost, a full version would be impossible. The DVD runs 84 minutes, which amounts to roughly 1-2 minutes of gore, but believe me, you will notice the difference if you've seen the edited version.  The picture quality brings the best out of a bad print. The picture is grainy and dirty at times, but like all low-budget movies, it is hard to make it look like it was shot in 35mm. The DVD extras are plentiful, and should more that appease horror fans. It has a 28 minute documentary aptly titled ""It's Only A Movie"", and it features Wes Craven et all giving their insights into the impact and appeal of the movie. The commentary by Craven and Sean S. Cunningham is inspired, funny, and thought provoking.  The reel of deleted scenes is the real gold mine for collectors.

156158,A3LQU8CWUYFMJH,079284632X,Blu Review Obscura,"[3, 3]","The Last House on the Left Blu-ray ReviewDistributor: MGM (US)So much has previously been said about this film that it is almost as hard to write something original as it is to sit through the movie without feeling a sense of real dread and loathing.That being said, there is much to like in the film itself. The story holds up pretty well and if you have ever wondered what it would actually be like to be either a killer or a victim thrown into a sudden struggle for life, then this film shows a realistic approach like no other before it. Forget all the routine slashers that would soon follow, The Last House on the Left dares to show its audience the true horror and danger of the human psychology and how far some are prepared to go to satisfy their fantasies.The film was shot documentary style using 16mm cameras which adds to the realism, however it is not a title which will benefit from the kind of intensive restoration used for Blu-ray releases. The 1.85:1 1080p transfer is grainy, scratched, dirty and contains a small amount of print damage throughout the film, however none of this should be seen as a negative as far as this title is concerned. Ultimately the film looks exactly as it should and with far enhanced colour detail, this is easily the best it has ever looked on home video. Anyone expecting to see a brand new pristine transfer is clearly thinking of the wrong film here.Audio is basic but adequate. Dialogue is clear and free from distortion but again don't go expecting to be making much use of your home cinema audio equipment. Like the transfer, the audio does what is required to match the film within.Extras are surprisingly good on this release. It would have been easy for MGM to just release this as a bare bones disc, however there are 3 documentaries on the making of the film, 2 audio commentaries, (one with the films director and the other with the principal cast who sound like they have just walked off the set of the movie itself) and also some out-takes and explicit footage involving even more nastiness which was cut from the film prior to release. With a trailer and a  featurette on the films score rounding off the extras, we really have been spoiled for choice here.For the horror collector or fans of the film, this release is an easy purchase. Being fully uncut and the best looking and sounding release so far and complete with a wide variety of extra features, the fact that the disc is not region locked also makes it a nice import for people outside of the US. MGM have however released this as one of their Best Buy exclusives, so you may need to dig around a little to find yourself a copy unless you have a US shipping address.All things considered this is not really film which can be enjoyed, more likely appreciated for what it is. As far as horror movies go, this one is more a study in extreme terror and watching the film for the first time in many years, I had forgotten just how nasty this one can get. The film is from an era where fear and tension were more important than special effects and cartoon villains and to newer horror fans who grew up on one regular slasher after another, the film may seem dated or even a little slow, but for those who like their horror to almost place you at the scene of the crime, there is much to disgust and truly horrify in this film.Like it or loath it The Last House on the Left is a horror classic which actually deserves its place in history as well as a worthy place in any respected horror fans collection.Mari, 17, is dying.

156159,A20IIR0422G3A5,079284632X,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[2, 4]","`The Last House on the Left' is famed horror writer / director Wes Craven's very first movie, made in 1972 with a budget of about $90,000, and it shows. If this were not done by Craven and if Craven had not gone on to do so many famous and remarkably good horror movies, it could easily have slipped into oblivion. The quality of the acting, direction, and cinematography make Tobe Hooper's `The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' look like a Stephen Spielberg masterpiece.The one thing that saves this movie is the realism of the horror. There is no improbably semi-mystical Jason or Freddie or Michael Myers here. This terror is created by all too real life dangers of slumming in an unsavory neighborhood looking to score some grass. In this very plausibly scary scenario, you can see the talent that created the much more professionally done and more highly charged opening scenes of `Scream'.The value of this DVD may still have been marginally historically interesting, if it were not for the modern audio commentary track by director Craven and producer Sean Cunningham. Among other things, they reveal that the story was taken from the plot of an Ingemar Bergmann film, `Virgin Spring'. The commentators quip that since Bergmann stole the story from some other source, it was fair game.In my mind, a commentary track like this virtually doubles the value of the movie, especially if one or more of the principles behind making the movie does it. This means their statements cannot be doubted, as they are simply describing their own experiences and impressions about the moviemaking process. You don't really need the filmmaker's word on this, but it is good to have their confirmation that this version has many of the more objectionable scenes restored. I suspect that most of these scenes were not the shots or blood but of skin and sexual content.The movie actually gains a fair amount of cachet in the light of recent real-life abduction, rape, and murder stories filling the news. It seems it is remarkably easy for a young girl to be forced into desperate situations.Most of the other extras tend to repeat the material in the commentary, except for the comments by the actors, some of whom were not professional actors at all.It seems that virtually the whole movie was filmed in producer Cunningham's home and environs. This did not deter from the movie, in that it the story simply takes place in the Connecticut suburbs anyway, so that was just as good or even better than filming on a Hollywood back lot.There is a fair amount of evidence that no one connected with the movie did a very good job of continuity and fact checking.

You can definitely see the potential in Craven by watching this early work, however; the movie as a whole is marred by time. While this film may have been quite the shocker back in it's day, a second viewing at this point in time doesn't really deliver the chills and thrills that it did back when it was released.Two young girls go to a concert, and in returning home decide to try and score themselves a little weed. They approach a man who leads them to an apartment upstairs. Once inside, they quickly realize they have made a big mistake. 3 escaped convicts (2 men and 1 woman) are waiting for them with sadistic glee. The girls are forced in the trunk and driven out to the woods, where they are forced to pee there pants, strip, & make-out with each other. Then they are raped all while the convicts laugh gleefully and perversely. An attempt to escape the confines of there attackers proves fatal.Our villains need a place to shack up, and it just so happens that the last house on the left belongs to the one of the girls parents, who have been anxiously awaiting there daughters safe return. After feeding and housing the killers, the parents soon discover that these 4 people have done away with there daughter.So what do they do.....they booby trap the house, and momma performs fellatio on one of the attackers while his hands are tied behind his back before biting of his yin-yang.The whole thing is kind of silly, far fetched, and unbelievable.

Very  disturbing  and  powerful,  Last  House  on  the  Left  gets  it's  message  across  and  doesn't  pull  any  punches  in  doing  so.  The  most  powerful  scene  in  this  movie,  and  perhaps  any  movie,  is  after  the  murderous  four  kills  one  of  the  hostages  and  watches  the  other  one  walk  into  a  pond  in  shock.  They  shoot  her  and  both  hostages  are  dead.  What  is  so  powerful  about  this  scene  is  that  if  you  look  in  the  killer's  faces  you  don't  see  pride  and  hapiness  that  they  just  killed  the  hostages,  but  instead  you  can  sense  that  they  know  what  they  are  doing  is  wrong  and  that  they  are  human,  but  they  just  can't  take  back  what  they  did  now.What  is  so  great  about  LHOTL  is  that  it  doesn't  treat  violence  as  a  thing  of  entertainment  on  movies,  but  instead  it  treats  it  like  voilence  is  in  real  life.  It  is  raw  in-your-face  documentery  style  that  you  can't  turn  away  from.  It  also  shows  that  real  villians  are  more  human  than  movies  make  them  out  to  be.  And  it  has  another  message,  that  the  parents  of  the  dispatched  daughter  seek  vengence  of  the  killers,  and  after  they  knock  off  the  killers  that  stay  at  there  house,  they  find  that  their  revenge  is  still  no  better  than  killing  in  the  first  place.The  DVD  is  also  great.  It  is  uncut,  only  the  DVD  so  don't  get  the  heavily  censored  VHS  version  or  you  will  end  up  kicking  yourself(  I  know  that  first  hand  ).  The  DVD  also  has  funny  and  entertaining  commentary  by  Wes  Craven  and  Sean  S.  Cunningham.  It  has  a  making  of  LHOTL  that  is  a  must  for  fans(  man,  Fred  Lincoln  has  gained  some  weight!  ).  It  has  some  outtakes,  but  they  have  no  sound  so  it  is  kind  of  lame.  A  good  introduction  before  the  movie  by  director  Wes  Craven,  Theatrical  trailer,  and  Forbidden  footage  which  is  good.This  DVD  is  a  great  buy,  especially  reccommended  for  horror  fans.4  out  of  4  stars.",5,The  Most  Powerful  Horror  Movie  Ever,1030579200,"08 29, 2002",2002,2210,"['Wow', 'can', 'say', 'watching', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'first', 'best', 'film', 'Very', 'disturbing', 'powerful', 'Last', 'House', 'Left', 'message', 'across', ""n't"", 'pull', 'punches', 'doing', 'so', 'most', 'powerful', 'scene', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'movie', 'murderous', 'four', 'one', 'hostages', 'watches', 'other', 'one', 'walk', 'pond', 'shock', 'shoot', 'hostages', 'are', 'dead', 'What', 'so', 'powerful', 'scene', 'look', 'killer', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'pride', 'hapiness', 'just', 'killed', 'hostages', 'instead', 'can', 'sense', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'wrong', 'are', 'human', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'back', 'what', 'did', 'so', 'great', 'LHOTL', ""n't"", 'treat', 'violence', 'thing', 'entertainment', 'movies', 'instead', 'voilence', 'real', 'life', 'raw', 'in-your-face', 'documentery', 'style', 'ca', ""n't"", 'turn', 'away', 'also', 'real', 'villians', 'are', 'more', 'human', 'movies', 'make', 'out', 'be', 'message', 'parents', 'dispatched', 'daughter', 'seek', 'vengence', 'killers', 'knock', 'off', 'killers', 'stay', 'house', 'find', 'revenge', 'still', 'better', 'killing', 'first', 'place.The', 'DVD', 'also', 'great', 'uncut', 'only', 'DVD', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'heavily', 'censored', 'VHS', 'version', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'kicking', 'know', 'first', 'hand', 'DVD', 'also', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'commentary', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'Sean', 'S.', 'Cunningham', 'making', 'LHOTL', 'must', 'fans', 'man', 'Fred', 'Lincoln', 'gained', 'weight', 'outtakes', 'have', 'sound', 'kind', 'lame', 'good', 'introduction', 'movie', 'director', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'Theatrical', 'trailer', 'Forbidden', 'footage', 'good.This', 'DVD', 'great', 'buy', 'especially', 'reccommended', 'horror', 'fans.4', '4', 'stars']",N/A

But they don't scare you with shocks and boogeymen, they scare you by showing the [messed] up things humans are capable of doing.This film is scary because it looks too real. It's a warning to people, don't trust anyone. The 2 girls go to some guys house to buy some smoke. They get kidnapped, raped, tortured, and it's a mess from there.In regards to the way the film looked, some say sloppy, amaturish, the filming looks just like ""The Evil Dead."" But the gore effects in this movie look real. The film is really violent. I think Wes Craven knew this when he was making the film, thats why hecut the violent scenes with stupid ones about two bumbling cops.

Wes Craven, who is recognized with his 'Scream' triology by masses, does a fine job in his debut.The movie's plot is as follows: A bunch of guys and a girl, think that they need more girls to their group for the sake of equalizing the number of girls and guys in the group, and of course having a little fun. We see two girls, who're to see a concert in a bad neighborhood. They want to have some 'grass', and ask someone in the street to have 'a cut'. He calls them to their house, and viola! They're trapped. It will be the next couple of violent hours where we see the girls being brutally harrassed, raped, and killed out in the woods.What makes the story more interesting is that it all happens in the walking distance of Mari's - one of the killed girls - house. The group changes clothes and knock on the family's door. In fact, they will be welcomed very well. However, things will change as the parents discover what they've done.The acting is not perfect; I must admit that. The soundtrack isn't either. In a lot of the violent moments, the music director chooses to put country folk music, which just doesn't make any sense. Had they put some real scary music, the effect would have been much more intensifying. However, 'Last House on the Left' is overall a successful production, which should be watched to see where we were before and where we are now in scary movies.

There are extended outtakes that show the disembowlment of one of the victims, and this goes on FOREVER!  Also, all of the outtakes are silent, as the sound portion was lost years ago.Anyway, it IS interesting to see where the creator of Nightmare on Elm Street, et al, started, but that's about where the value of this film ends.

Things go awry when sadistic prison escapees Krug Stillo (David A. Hess) and Fred ""Weasel"" Padovsky (Fred Lincoln) along with Krug's junkie son Junior (Marc Sheffler) and their tough bisexual girlfriend Sadie (Jeramie Rain) kidnap the two, leaving Mari's parents baffled by her disappearance as they were planning her a surprise birthday party. While the police reassure them that ""lots of kids stay out all night,"" the murderous bunch - and I'll leave out graphic details for those not yet initiated - rape, torture, humiliate, and finally murder the two helpless girls. But the thugs soon have their own run of bad luck as they turn up at Mari's parent's house seeking shelter, and as soon as the worried parents find out what happened to their daughter - and by whom - they hand out some discipline of their own.Shot in Westport Connecticut in the fall of 1971 (a lot of it in producer Sean S. Cunningham's mother's house and yard) this grisly little item with the working title Night of Vengeance pulls no punches and never gives the terrified viewer a break. This is a true horror film that you won't laugh off as the end credits roll, and writer/director Wes Craven himself is still startled by it even though he achieved his goal to make a movie that would scare the hell out of people. Many different cuts of this movie have been circulated due to the fact that irate theater managers and projectionists to name a few excised anything they found objectionable, and as a result Craven and Cunningham were hard pressed to come across a version that was virgin territory. Craven claimed that at the time he wasn't aware that legalities could force his hand when it came to the final cut, so the 1972 theatrical release and subsequent VHS release lost some footage. For the DVD release thirty years later, the film has been assembled in its complete form for the first time ever on home video.MGM certainly went all out to please the fans here. The DVD is at last presented uncut and in a new 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen (fullscreen on the other side) transfer which looks surprising good for a movie shot on 16 mm. We get a fair to poor 1.0 mono soundtrack as the sound on this movie wasn't recorded all that well. For those who can't make out some of the dialogue, theres also English, French, and Spanish subtitles and English Closed Captions. There's an entertaining and often amusing audio commentary by Wes Craven and Sean S. Cunningham, who seem to genuinely enjoy reliving the experience and poking fun at themselves. A definite high-point of the supplements is the featurette It's Only A Movie: The Making of the Last House on the Left, which features new interviews with Wes Craven, Sean S. Cunningham, Steve Miner, along with cast members David A. Hess, Fred Lincoln, Marc Sheffler, Martin Kove and Lucy Grantham. Like the commentary there's lots of information here, and a few amusing moments like when Fred Lincoln razzes David A. Hess for daring to say ""[pee]your pants"" to a girl. There's also the option of starting the movie with an introduction by Wes Craven, where he nervously informs us we're about to see the uncut version of the film, and how removing small children and pets from the room would be in our best interest. The theatrical trailer is included, and a silent ten minute montage of outtakes and dailies which includes the never used disembowelment scene, save for a few seconds in the final cut. Last but not least there's a short featurette titled Forbidden Footage, where cast and crew discuss the filming of some of the more violent scenes. A great package for the fans of this cult classic, and do send the kids to bed and the in-laws home first.

Cunningham (Friday the 13th), written and directed by horror maven Wes Craven (I'm a poet and didn't know it), the man behind the popular Nightmare on Elm Street and Scream films, the film features Sandra Cassel (The Filthiest Show in Town), Lucy Grantham, David Hess (Swamp Thing), Fred J. Lincoln (who has since gone on to the wonderful world of adult films as not only and actor but also as a director...you may remember him from the film Edward Penishands 3), Jeramie Rain (The Abductors), Marc Sheffler, Gaylord St. James (Deadly Weapons), Cynthia Carr, Marshall Anker (Shamus), and character actor Martin Kove, who many probably most will recognize as the very nasty and uptight Cobra Kai Sensei John Kreese from the film The Karate Kid (1984).The film starts off with a shower scene, and we get a nice shot of Sandra Cassel's jubblies.  She plays the character of Mari, and we soon find out she's going out with a friend, Phyllis (Grantham), to see a concert featuring a band called Bloodlust.  Her parents, played by Gaylord St. James and Cynthia Carr, are concerned, but she has just turned 17, and you can't keep them on the farm forever.  Anyway, as the girls drive into the city, we hear a news broadcast on the radio, going into great detail, about a couple of very nasty criminals who've recently escaped, and are the focal point for a statewide manhunt, along with their two accomplices.  We then cut to a seedy apartment where we get to meet these lovely individuals, obviously all New Yorkers given their accents, featuring Krug (Hess), who appears to be the leader, Fred 'Weasel' Podowski (Lincoln), who looks like the illegitimate love child of Joe Pesci and Arnold Horshack, Krug's son Junior (Sheffler), who definitely looks like Arnold Horshack, and finally the group floozie Sadie (Rain).  Okay, so now the girls are in the city, and they approach Junior, who just happens to be standing outside, for some wacky tobaccy, to which he lures them up to the apartment (Sadie couldn't handle the three of them I guess so they decided to recruit some fresh meat), and thus begins the defilement.  The following day the group decides to leave the city (too much heat) and they toss the girls in the trunk.  Their car eventually breaks down out in the country near familiar surroundings, and more defilement takes place in the woods.  Eventually retribution comes, and in some very unique forms...I've heard much over the years about this film, and while it does possess some fairly intense material, I've seen worse (check out some early 80's Italian horror films and you'll see what I mean).  Some have stated the film has a documentary feel, but I would disagree...it felt more to me like a no frills, low-budget 70's film with a lot of bad music (you can thank Hess, the actor who played Krug, as he responsible for most of the score, which ranged from weird hippy music to upbeat pianny music...and who was responsible for the audio mixing?  The volume on the music was much too high, often overpowering the dialog).  There are a number of harsh and brutally graphic scenes, but then this is offset by scenes of what I think are supposed to be of a comic nature featuring the local sheriff and his deputy (played by Kove), showcasing their complete ineptitude as law enforcement officials.  I think the non-comedic scenes were handled well, as Craven infuses a strong sense of tension, the kind where you want to look away but can't, finally assaulting you with a good deal of the ultra-violence, taking it where few, if any, had gone before at the time, featuring some of the most realistic blood I've seen in a film in a long time.  As far as performances go, they were decent, but I felt the guy who played Krug had much more presence than anyone else in the film, and rightfully so as he was the main antagonist.  The final act featuring the retribution scenes was odd to me as it seemed unlikely that the characters would have the presence of mind to go to the trouble setting things up the way they did, especially given the circumstances involved (if you've seen the film, you probably understand what I mean, but I don't want to give away any more than I already have), but that's not to say I didn't enjoy it as it provided a suitable outlet given the grotesque nature of the crimes committed by the despicable foursome.  I think it's important to note that if you have delicate sensibilities, you should probably avoid this film as it does have a couple of particularly nasty scenes, one involving a disemboweling and another involving a rape.  All in all a powerful film with some really weird musical choices.There's a short introduction available featuring Wes Craven, and he basically says this is the most complete version of the film available.  The DVD features both the fullscreen and widescreen anamorphic formats (presented in 1.85:1 aspect ratio, enhanced for 16 X 9 TVs) and has decent audio in English mono.  There are a number of extras available including a commentary track by writer/director Craven and producer Cunningham, Outtakes and Dailies (14 minutes), Forbidden Footage featurette (8 minutes), It's Only a Movie featurette (28 minutes), and a theatrical trailer for the film.Cookieman108",3,"""How'd we get into the sex crime business anyway?""",1112400000,"04 2, 2005",2005,5770,"['do', ""n't"",

156186,A2HII4U9WQ0XUV,079284632X,"Dark Mechanicus JSG ""Black Ops Teep""","[5, 8]","Wes Craven's uber-low-budget freshman cinematic outing ""Last House on the Left"" leaves me as puzzled as his second, ever so-slightly more effective take on brutality ""The Hills Have Eyes"", chiefly because I just don't understand why these two laughably awful clunkers are considered so influential to modern horror movies.That said, it's useful to compare ""Last House"" with ""Hills"", since both films have a lot in common: 1) Both are astonishly low-budget---this is movie-making on the cheap, folks, not so much Low Budget as ""We made this film for the price of a subway token and a Big Mac"" filmmaking; 2) Both feature what are supposed to be horrific and harrowing collisions between All-American Innocence and evil, subhuman savages; 3) Both of these early Craven outtings really, really try to be shocking; 4) Both movies are abysmal and deliver absolutely zero scares. Just as there are a few celebrities floating around who are famous for being famous, ""Last House"" and ""Hills"" are movies that are shocking for the sake of being shocking.Sadly, ""Last House on the Left"" isn't that shocking at all. It's crudely made, most of the acting is atrocious (particularly the avenging parents and the bumptious police), and scenes of true horror are constantly undercut by comedic sequences which serve absolutely no purpose other than to ruin the film's atmosphere of unease. Why have a pair of Laurel & Hardy-esque style sheriffs in what is supposedly a film of uncompromising savagery? And why, Wes Craven, tell me why would you include the toe-tapping musical number ""Sadie and Krug"", meant to be a ballad to the film's two psychos and set to the accompaniment of kazoos?Yes, the film features a musical number with kazoos. ""It's only a Movie""? Let's hope so. With that in mind:THE BASICS: Two wholesome, all-American girls go on a fun-filled trip to the Big Apple to score pot and attend a ""Bloodlust"" concert. They are picked up by a motley crew of criminals led by a ravening psycopath named ""Krug"" (shades of Freddy Krueger, anyone?) and get more bloodlust than they bargained for. Their killers subsequently seek refuge for the night in the home of the parents of one of their victims.THE GOOD: David Hess, who plays the surly, snarling, cold-blooded killer Krug, is actually creepily charismatic and does a good job as a Manson-esque psycho. Hess also penned the haunting ditty ""The Road goes on to Nowhere"" and the rest of the film's soundtrack, though if he's responsible for the kazoo number he should do hard time.The three other psychos that make up Krug's merry men are also competent. Jeramie Rain does an itchingly nasty job as Krug's gun moll Sadie, serving up a convincing performance that is a little too chillingly close to Charles Manson's adoring female 'Family' members. Marc Sheffler plays Krug's slightly less repulsive younger brother Junior, and manages to convey his wormish, torn character's drug dependency and weakness.Fred Lincoln also does a nice turn as Fred ""Weasel"" Podowski, who's just there for the ride but is as happy as Krug when the claret begins to flow. Incidentally, Mr. Lincoln evidently found his metier later in the Porn industry, starring in such family fare as ""Devil in Miss Jones Part II"" and directing charmers like ""Heidi Does Hollywood"" and ""Anal Intruder 10"" (I'm not kidding: check out Lincoln's bio on IMDB if you don't believe me).Sandra Cassel and Lucy Grantham are, I think, quite convincing as the two teenage girls in peril, and the scenes of their rape, torture, and subsequent murder at the hands of Krug's thugs are unpleasant and shot with an unflinching camera. Doubtless this would be rough, grueling stuff, if not for....THE BAD: The young Wes Craven really, really wanted to shock his audience, but unfortunately there's no suspense here, no shock, no horror, nothing remotely scary. You have a lot of sloppy editing, and the sequence in which Cassel and Grantham are tortured and murdered, though harrowing, is undercut by the brutish, forced comic scenes with the blundering deputies.And what's with the ornate American Gothic house featured in the creepy cover art? Nothing remotely like that appears in the film; what you get here is a typical 1970's ranch house that appears to have been decorated, from a K-Mart, a few minutes before shooting started.THE UGLY: Gaylord St. James and Cynthia Carr as the avenging parents are unremittingly awful and completely ruin whatever tension and suspense the movie might have delivered. And Marshall Anker and Martin Cove as the blundering policemen are mind-blastingly horrible. There's a sequence where the Sheriff and his deputy, their car having broken down, try to get a ride in a chicken truck. Why were these scenes included at all?Finally, you also get a kazoo sing-along, which in its own fashion is pretty terrifying, though not in the way Craven intended.THE VERDICT: Abominably bad, not shocking, and somewhat repulsive. If you want to be shocked, you'll find more shocking stuff in 30 seconds of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" than you will in this atrociously bad film; come to think of it, you'll find more terror in 5 minutes of any of the ""Friday the 13th"" movies than you will in all of ""Last House.""If you're a Wes Craven completist or have a few hours to waste on a morbid curiosity, then you may want to check it out.

The plots usually consisted of placing a group of teens in a remote setting and watching the most promiscuous ones systematically get picked off by a demented and/or deformed psycho.  Usually the lone survivor was the group virgin.  ""The Last House on the Left"" doesn't deviate much from this formula.  Instead of sex our unsuspecting teens are in search of marijuana and they have the misfortune of trying to score from a group of escaped psychotics.  Having come out in 1972, there's not much to distinguish this flick from those that followed.  Our young unfortunates are subsequently raped, tortured and subjected to other deviant behaviors.  The difference here is the perpetrators aren't faceless hockey-masked lunatics.  And comeuppance is dished out in the end.

156189,A24VVTYRN7BBI3,079284632X,David H. Downing,"[8, 13]","When LAST HOUSE first came out, back in 1972, it had people vomiting and fainting in the aisles.  Now, a little over thirty years later, it has people asking why it still warrants our attention, when there are more slasher/splatter movies on a video rental store's shelves than there are cockroaches in a big-city apartment building.  Hey, there's even been a major motion picture with a disemboweling -- HANNIBAL.Actually, there's some possibility that what we're seeing today isn't all of what they saw back in 1972.  Although Wes Craven's introduction on this DVD says this is the most complete version available, there's some footage included as part of the extras that gives us a much more graphic, extended version of the disemboweling scene.  It's unclear from the ""making of"" documentary whether this is actually what they saw back in 1972, but even if it isn't, the film still has power for other reasons.Part of this film's continued impact is historical.  LAST HOUSE is the first significant achievement by Wes Craven, who has gone on to become a major figure in both film and television.  It may also be that if it weren't for LAST HOUSE, there would be NO slasher/splatter movies on any video rental store's shelves, because LAST HOUSE was the movie that created the genre.  Film scholars should also note that LAST HOUSE was based on the same 14th-century Swedish folktale as THE VIRGIN SPRING, and contains various allusions to the Bergman film.But it isn't just horror movie historians who believe LAST HOUSE still deserves public and critical attention.  Many people, including yours truly, feel that even though it's no longer cutting edge, it still retains its original impact.  Several good arguments have already been made, which I'll present along with my own.The most widely voiced argument seems to be that while other films have equaled or surpassed LAST HOUSE in the amount and explicitness of their violence, they don't measure up in credibility.  This credibility comes partly from the context in which the violence occurs, and partly from the film's look and feel.Regarding context, any violent act is less disturbing if it either (a) seems totally removed from any life experience you can imagine getting into, and/or (b) happens to someone you can't see as a real person.  Such is the case with so many movies that present contrived situations and victims who are little more than shooting gallery ducks.Such is not the case, however with LAST HOUSE.  The two adolescent girls, Mari and Phyllis, could be people you went to school with, and their humiliation, torture, rape, murder, and mutilation is the end result of a mistake that's easy to imagine making -- letting your guard down because you were having fun and the excitement of the moment made you careless and overconfident.  In this case, Mari and Phyllis are off to a rock concert to celebrate Mari's 16th birthday and want to score some weed.  Unfortunately, they go off with the wrong guy and end up the captives of Krug Stillo, Fred ""Weasel"" Podowski, and Sadie -- three escaped convicts who have a very sadistic idea of fun.  (The aforementioned wrong guy is Junior Stillo, Krug's illegitimate son, who is a reluctant participant.)  When the girls try to resist and escape, the sadism degenerates into bestial rage. So much for the notion that if you stand up to the bullies, they'll back down.And here, I'd like to add one of my personal reasons for finding LAST HOUSE effective.  Krug and Co. and the atrocities they committed against Mari and Phyllis seem all to believable to me because they remind me of several characters I had the misfortune to get mixed up with many years ago.  The  details wouldn't be germane to this review, but I think it's germane to say that there are probably many other folks who've been similarly -- if not quite so extremely -- victimized, and so can relate to the events in LAST HOUSE.Moving on to the look and feel issue, while we all appreciate the polished, slick look of a big-budget Hollywood film , that look makes it obvious you're watching a fabrication.  But  LAST HOUSE is a low-budget movie with with that grainy, washed-out low-budget look and slightly muffled low-budget sound.  The filmmakers also deliberately used documentary-style shooting techniques, because their previous work had been largely in the area of documentary films.  All of this combined creates the strong illusion that you're eavesdropping on real events.The second major argument concern the reaction of the killer to what they've done.  Unlike Jason and other mindless killing machines, the killers are themselves shocked and horrified by their own acts, which forces the viewer to find those acts all the more shocking.Finally, I'd like to challenge one basic assumption made by those who claim LAST HOUSE no longer has any power -- that the ubiquity of graphic violence in the cinema must inevitably cause the general public to adopt a ""So what else is new"" attitude toward it.  Granted, constant or repeated exposure to a particular stimulus tend to desensitize one to that stimulus.  In fact, some groups of people, such as E.R. doctors, policemen, and social workers, MUST desensitize themselves to heinous and extreme acts of violence to do their jobs properly and stay sane.  But we aren't all in those lines of work, and so don't all have to force or let ourselves ease to feel shock when something shocking happens.  Even if you've seen every other slasher/splatter movie on your video rental store's shelves, you should still be able to get a shock from LAST HOUSE if your emotions are still alive.",5,"No longer

When I see people getting killed I know that I want to hear soft James Taylor type music. It added nothing to the atmosphere of the film, and in fact hurt it.-The editing. I have never seen such bad editing. One moment one of the victims is across a large creek from her attacker, and the next the attacker is on the same side chasing her again. I could go on, but there are so many editing goofs that I would be here all night describing them.-The screenplay. The situation itself could have been believable if the dialogue , and scenes, had been better written. As it is the entire situation seemed really unbelievable. It makes me wonder how this film ever got made.-The acting. None of the story was believable because the acting was so awful. As I said before I love cheesey movies. Sometimes that includes bad acting, but when it is combines with the above stated faults it makes it a horrible thing to witness.The reviewer who said that this is an important horror film has got to be kidding me.

I'm not kidding. Poor film quality. Really bad acting, stupid beyond belief characters, bad dialog (the part where Mari tells her friend about how her breasts have grown was particularly laughable and could only have been written by a man).The second half of the movie, when the parents find out and start to exact their revenge is pretty good. The characters all seem to ""come alive"" and find their purpose. The mother's revenge is pretty awesome and so is the father chasing Krug around with the chainsaw.

156208,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,079284632X,General Zombie,"[2, 4]","This is Wes Craven's first film, and a somewhat deservedly infamous movie.  Certainly, it tried to push the borders of what a film could do, particularly back in 72.  The fact of the matter is, however, that the execution in this film is just so botched that it doesn't much matter how extreme it's trying to be.  The performances are too weak, and the effects are too lame for this movie really to work.  And mind you, this is coming from a horror fan's perspective, and one who can and has accepted the budgetary limits of these sorts of films.  'Night of the Living Dead', 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', 'Martin' and 'Cannibal Holocaust' were all made on similarly miniscule budgets, and are each masterpieces of the horror genre, each unquestionably in my top ten of the genre, and readily overcaming their budgetary limits.  'The Last House on the Left', however, just can't pull it off, for a number of reasons.David Hess is pretty much the only high point of the film.  He's sufficiently vicious and sleazy, though his performance faulters greatly at times. (See the final minutes of the film)  Unfortunately, his performances is completely negated by the rest of the gang, who are horrible and dated walking cliches, who aren't remotely frightening or convincing.  Junior is particuarly horrible,  He's meant to be the 'good one', but he's just so stupid and obnoxious that he's almost unbearable to watch.  The cops are even worse, and really hurt the film.  The whole movie has got a theoretically comic subplot involving the police investigating the girls' disappearance, which totally kills an already not very good movie.  The cops are, again, unrelentingly obnoxious, and the whole subplot just ruins whatever little mood the film may have created.  And don't give me any of this crap about how the cop subplot is satirical and whatnot: It's filler, plain and simple, regardless of what it may have been intended to be.  The film would've been all of 50 minutes without it, so Craven had to dump some extra stuff in.Finally, the shocking violence is largely just boring and unconvincing.  It's occasionally uncomfortable, particularly the sexual stuff, but mostly they just sit around, or wander around the forest, attempting to escape.  And the final killings are largely just stagey and melodramatic.  The  parents' revenge is equally lame, particularly the dads' endless chasing of Krug about the house, and the oral castration scene, a scene infinitely funnier than one would imagine such a scene could be. (Krug's making Junior commit suicide is pretty good, however.  The rest of it is pretty lame, however)This movie finds itself in a tough place.  Do what it's trying to do well, and it would be too unbearable.  Do what it actually did, and it's just kinda boring and stupid, for the most part.  This film is historically significant, and something of a curiosity, so serious horror fans shouldn't hesitate to see it.  But, it's just not very good.Grade: D+",2,Meh,1119312000,"06 21, 2005",2005,2980,"['Wes', 'Craven', 'first', 'film', 'somewhat', 'deservedly', 'infamous', 'movie', 'Certainly', 'tried', 'push', 'borders', 'what', 'film', 'could', 'do', 'particularly', 'back', '72', 'fact', 'matter', 'however', 'execution', 'film', 'just', 'so', 'botched', ""n't"", 'much', 'matter', 'how', 'extreme', 'trying', 'be', 'performances', 'are', 'too', 'weak', 'effects', 'are', 'too', 'lame', 'movie', 'really', 'work', 'mind', 'coming', 'horror', 'fan', 'perspective', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'accepted', 'budgetary', 'limits', 'sorts', 'films', ""'Night"", 'Living', 'Dead', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', ""'Martin"", ""'Cannibal"", 'Holocaust', 'were', 'made', 'similarly', 'miniscule', 'budgets', 'are', 'masterpieces', 'horror', 'genre', 'unquestionably', 'top', 'ten', 'genre', 'readily', 'overcaming', 'budgetary', 'limits', 'Last', 'House', 'Left', 'however', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pull', 'off', 'number', 'reasons.David', 'Hess', 'pretty', 'much', 'only', 'high', 'point', 'film', 'sufficiently', 'vicious', 'sleazy', 'performance', 'faulters', 'greatly', 'times', 'See', 'final', 'minutes', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'performances', 'completely', 'negated', 'rest', 'gang', 'who', 'are', 'horrible', 'dated', 'walking', 'cliches', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'remotely', 'frightening', 'convincing', 'Junior', 'particuarly', 'horrible', 'meant', 'be', ""'good"", 'one', 'just', 'so', 'stupid', 'obnoxious', 'almost', 'unbearable', 'watch', 'cops', 'are', 'even', 'worse', 'really', 'hurt', 'film', 'whole', 'movie', 'got', 'theoretically', 'comic', 'subplot', 'involving', 'police', 'investigating', 'girls', 'disappearance', 'totally', 'already', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'cops', 'are', 'again', 'unrelentingly', 'obnoxious', 'whole', 'subplot', 'just', 'little', 'mood', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'created', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'crap', 'how', 'cop', 'subplot', 'satirical', 'whatnot', 'filler', 'plain', 'simple', 'regardless', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'intended', 'be', 'film', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', '50', 'minutes', 'so', 'Craven', 'had', 'dump', 'extra', 'stuff', 'in.Finally', 'shocking', 'violence', 'largely', 'just', 'boring', 'unconvincing', 'occasionally', 'uncomfortable', 'particularly', 'sexual', 'stuff', 'mostly', 'just', 'sit', 'around', 'wander', 'forest', 'attempting', 'escape', 'final', 'killings', 'are', 'largely', 'just', 'stagey', 'melodramatic', 'parents', 'revenge', 'equally', 'lame', 'particularly', 'dads', 'endless', 'chasing', 'Krug', 'house', 'oral', 'castration', 'scene', 'scene', 'infinitely', 'funnier', 'one', 'would', 'imagine', 'scene', 'could', 'be', 'Krug', 'making', 'Junior', 'commit', 'suicide', 'pretty', 'good', 'however', 'rest', 'pretty', 'lame', 'however', 'movie', 'tough', 'place', 'Do', 'what', 'trying', 'do', 'well', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'unbearable', 'Do', 'what', 'actually', 'did', 'just', 'kinda', 'boring', 'stupid', 'most', 'part', 'film', 'historically', 'significant', 'something', 'curiosity', 'so', 'serious', 'horror', 'fans', 'should', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'see', 'just', 'not', 'very', 'good.Grade', 'D+']",N/A

This time around (I guess nothing haunts me now) I enjoyed the thrill ride, so I must be sick!  The movie begins by saying that the events are based on real facts.  whether or not that's true, it got me sitting on the edge of my seat.  Two friends, fun-loving Phyllis and Mari are on the way to a rock concert.  They decide to pick up some pot (bad mistake) and get themselves kidnaped by a couple of escape convicts, a crazy ""animal like"" woman and the drug-addict son of one of the convicts.  They rape, drug and torture these teens.  Mari's parents decide to seek revenge on the group.  There was plenty of gore---one girl gets stabbed and her guts are pulled out and there's a chainsaw.  My favorite part was the revenge scene where Mari's mother bites off something belonging to one of the convicts.

All the more puzzling is that this film has gained classic status in the horror genre.  It never produces anything that remotely resembles a scare and the only thing genuinely disturbing about it is its reputation.  While it does contain some memorably bizarre sequences, they lose all impact when accompanied by wildy inappropriate music and amateurish editing.  This one really isn't even grindhouse worthy material.  It often comes off as quite stupid as all the characters act in irrational ways.  Their actions never resemble those of actual human beings and because all the characters are so ignorant (both the villains and the ""good"" guys) it is impossible to work up any sort of sympathy for any one in this film.  The script is filled with plot holes the size of the grand canyon and has to rely on coincidences of the most improbable sort.  It never feels even vaguely realistic.  It is also grotesquely dated with references to women's lib etc.  In some films this can be a charming thing but here it only showcases just how inept the original concept of the film was.This edition of the film contains a fairly dull commentary track from the three male leads in the film.  There are also a couple of documentary features with Wes Craven pontificating and giving this dubious effort far more respect than it deserves. While Craven has gone on to do some genuinely effective horror films, his talent is nowhere on display in this ridiculous production.  The print used for this edition is anamorphic widescreen and contains a fair amount of damage, although the film will never look good under any circumstances as it was shot on cheap film stock and contains several out of focus shots.  There is also some ""silent"" deleted footage that contains lots of nudity and blood covered lesbian oral sex. Does WalMart know what they are selling (for five bucks)?Why this is a classic film will remain a mystery to me.  I love bad films but this one is so bad I coudln't find anything to enjoy about it.  It isn't shocking or groundbreaking in any way.  It isn't fun or funny.  It isn't frighteing.  To me it just seemed stupid, pointless, amateurish and dull.

The movie can be considered scary because the type of crime committed in the film is a realistic possibility anywhere. The Last House on the Left is disturbing and shocking. Four convicts escape from prison and hide out in an apartment building. When 2 young girls Mari Collingwood(Sandra Cassel) and Phyllis Stone(Lucy Grantham) go searching for marijuana in the wrong place they run into the convicts and are tortured, raped and left for dead. It preceeded ""I Spit on Your Grave""(1978) which seems to have stolen many of the same ideas from Last House but added much more nudity and excessive brutality.My problem with this movie however is the acting with one exception. If you do view this film you will see what I mean. Marshall Anker and Martin Kove(The sheriff and the deputy) give the most [horrible] performances I've ever seen unless these cops are supposed to be ... clowns. Gaylord St. James plays Dr. William Collingwood, besdies seeming disconcerned about his daughter's disappearence it takes him about 5 minutes to kill the lead convict Krug Stillo(David Hess) with a chainsaw. The only notable performance in my opinion was that of David Hess who was excellent as a maniacal, conscienceless, cruel psychopath.The Last House on the Left is without a doubt a ground breaking film and one you won't soon forget. It will get a reaction from you whether it be positive or negative which I believe was Wes Cravens goal in this film.

Its SEVERLY dated (just look at....everything).  Half of the time you are either shocked or laughing you butt off.  I threw a horror movie festival over spring break one time and this was one of the movies we watched.  Well it was hysterical, most of the time in the beginning we expected porno music to kick in and for a pizza man to show up.  However once it got going, we still found ourselves laughing but also found some moments that were cringing and awesome (from a horror fanatic's point of view).  My favorite scene has to be the dentist nightmare.  What makes this film so shocking has to be the back and forth segments of horror and humor and that this movie was released in 1972.Here's the story.  Two girls are on their way to a concert and on their way want to get some pot.  They run into four convicts who end up raping and murdering them in the woods right next to the house of one of the girls.  Since the murderers' car broke down, they decide to stay at the girl's house.  The parents willingly let them stay at their house, feed them and so forth.  Slowly they find out that both the girls are dead and then extract their revenge.  There is a chainsaw scene and might I add that the chainsaw can barely cut and it's amusing how long it takes to saw through a chair!This movie is also the first of Wes Craven's directing career.  I've seen several of his films and most of them are good but not great.  This one has a great story but because of an inexperienced director, an extremely low budget and so forth it suffers greatly.  They recently remade Craven's second film, The Hills Have Eyes, and I read online that they are considering remaking this one as well.  After viewing this movie I thought that this is one of the few movies that really deserves a remake providing it has good actors.The Last House on the Left is still amusing and I would watch it again.  It's shocking, it's unintentionally funny, intentionally funny (the scene where the policemen run out of gas is hysterical) and most of all cheesy.  Yet at the same time, there are parts that you would not see in movies today and I'm surprised that this was allowed release in theaters back in 1972.I'll admit I don't have this DVD, but the cover makes the film appear to be darker than it really is, as the house never looks evil like it does on the box cover.  You'll see what I mean if you watch the Last House on the Left.

In fact, it's lousy.  First of all, last house on the left hasn't got anything to do with this movie.  Sure, the house and skull on the DVD package makes one think that this looks like a movie about a haunted house or the house of a maniacal killer which could give one the impression that this is a great horror movie, but it's not.  What you really get in this movie is nothing but a rape scene and then some revenge by the parents...WOW, what a painfully boring so-called horror movie!!  This movie isn't scary, it's lame!!I must admit that I was appalled by how poorly this movie was put together...just a pathetic piece of cinema, really.  And the acting???  You would indeed get better acting in a porno movie, that's how bad it is.  The only actor worth anything is David Hess as Krug as he does a decent job, but the music is atrocious, and it is very difficult to take this movie seriously as serious as the subject matter of the movie is.  Yes, the rape and kill scenes were graphic and disturbing, but overall, the movie is a complete joke!!  This movie isn't horrifying, it's garbage.  This movie isn't good, it's a waste of your money.  The first half was terrible, but the second half of this movie is nothing short of ridiculous.  I think Wes Craven holds ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" and ""Scream"" in higher regard and as his best work rather than this garbage.In short, ""Last House On The Left"" is not scary whatsoever, slightly disturbing at times, but otherwise mindless garbage. I don't see the fascination with this movie and I've seen it twice (saw it twice to make sure I wasn't missing something) and that's two times too many to be honest.

This movie is SICK!!! What really makes it bad is how realistic it is, those poor girls. These convicts are just the scum of the earth and in my opinion they got of easy at the end of the film. Great performances all the way around, their is not a weak performance in the movie. Krug, the convict leader is especially evil and vicious. His girl friend is also convincing as a disgusting, heartless, killer. The two teenaged girls also play their parts extreemly well, especially the daughter of the older couple. This movie gave me bad dreams and was way more unsetteling than Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday the 13th because the monsters in this movie were just human beings. These girls were so naive and foolish, (Message to everyone reading, when buying drugs from strangers never, NEVER, follow them anywhere to get it. Wait for them to come back with the drugs, stay in a public place. If anyone does try to convince you to go with them someplace to buy drugs, they are trying to set you up to be robbed or worse, immediatly break of communication with them and get away! Believe me I know about these things.) they were in over their heads, they were just kids even though they might have looked like women. The rape and pyschological torture scenes were beyond the beyond, espeically the one in the woods where the girls were made to have sex with each other. Both girls were brave in different ways, and the daughter of the older couple was even able to make these cold blooded, remorseless convicts feel guilty about what they had done, she shamed them with her purity in comparison to their filth. That scene is the best scene in the movie. The convicts get their just deserts I suppose but it does not make up for what the parents lost. The bumbling cops were the perfect compliament, tottaly inept, their foolish mishandling of the situation cost the girls their lives. I read a lot of reviews where people complained about these scense, claiming that they did not understand why these ""comic"" scenes were in the movie, Craven should not have tried to be ""funny"". Instead he should have concentrated more on the terror. Either these people are retarded or have no sense of irony. The scenes with the cops were in no way intended to be funny at all, they were meant to illustrate how stupid the police were and how badly they handled the situation. The happy, slapstick music and the banter between the Sherieff and the Deputy was meant to demonstrate the juvinille, country bumpkin, absurd mindstate of the police. They did not take the situation serioulsy and that is why the scenes with them are not serious. It is meant as a contrast to the horror of what is happening to the teenaged girl in the woods. While the cops are goofing of and teasing each other innocent lives are being lost. I also liked the happy music Craven used, it contrasted perfectly with the dead serious situation of the abuse of the girls in the woods and made it even more disturbing. The music hightened the tension of the film and made the viewer really feel the horror of the situation even more. This movie is BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD!!!! But not bad as in low quality, bad as in EVIL!!!  The music during the credits was really distrubing. This movie seems like it was from hell or something, I dont know, this movie got to me and that is hard to do. I have seen ""I Spit On Your Grave"" but that was just basically well acted rape porn with a revenge twist. I dont know what this movie is, I do not know how to label or define it, it defies classification. It is not horror, drama, action, it is just EVIL. Some reviwers gave this movie bad reviews because they said it was badly acted and directed, to me that sounds like a pyschological defense mechanism to avoid the emotional truama this movie induces on the viwer. I can understand why someone would hate this move, espically women, and feel that it never should have been made. But I do not think anyone that is being honest with themselves can flippanlty disregard it and claim that it had no impact on them, that it was ""funny"". Only really, really, sick people would think this movie was funny. This movie is CRAZY! You cannot make movies like this anymore in America, only in the 1970s where directors truly free to really push the limits. This is by far Craven's best film, better than Scream or anything else he has ever made. This movie has an R rating, they must have bribed someone to get that. This movie was edited, I know their are scenes of violence and rape that were cut, especially the scene in the woods. Does anyone know if their is an unrated version of this film?",4,The last movie you  should ever let your kids see!,1055808000,"06 17, 2003",2003,4768,"['Whoa', 'Whoa', 'Whoa', 'O.K', 'what', 'kind', 'movie', 'not', 'get', 'more', 'disturbing', 'then', 'movie', 'i', 'just', 'watched', 'last', 'night', 'movie', 'SICK', 'What', 'really', 'bad', 'how', 'realistic', 'poor', 'girls', 'convicts', 'are', 'just', 'scum', 'earth', 'opinion', 'got', 'easy', 'end', 'film', 'Great', 'way', 'not', 'weak', 'performance', 'movie', 'Krug', 'convict', 'leader', 'especially', 'evil', 'vicious', 'girl', 'friend', 'also', 'convincing', 'disgusting', 'heartless', 'killer', 'two', 'teenaged', 'girls', 'also', 'play', 'parts', 'extreemly', 'well', 'especially', 'daughter', 'older', 'couple', 'movie', 'gave', 'bad', 'dreams', 'was', 'way', 'more', 'unsetteling', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'Friday', '13th', 'monsters', 'movie', 'were', 'just', 'human', 'beings', 'girls', 'were', 'so', 'naive', 'foolish', 'Message', 'everyone', 'reading', 'when', 'buying', 'drugs', 'strangers', 'never', 'NEVER', 'follow', 'anywhere', 'get', 'Wait', 'come', 'back', 'drugs', 'stay', 'public', 'place', 'anyone', 'try', 'convince', 'go', 'someplace', 'buy', 'drugs', 'are', 'trying', 'set', 'up', 'be', 'robbed', 'worse', 'immediatly', 'break', 'communication', 'get', 'away', 'Believe', 'know', 'things', 'were', 'heads', 'were', 'just', 'kids', 'even', 'might', 'have', 'looked', 'women', 'rape', 'pyschological', 'torture', 'scenes', 'were', 'espeically', 'one', 'woods', 'where', 'girls', 'were', 'made', 'have', 'sex', 'other', 'girls', 'were', 'brave', 'different', 'ways', 'daughter', 'older', 'couple', 'was', 'even', 'able', 'make', 'cold', 'blooded', 'remorseless', 'convicts', 'feel', 'guilty', 'what', 'had', 'done', 'shamed', 'purity', 'comparison', 'filth', 'scene', 'best', 'scene', 'movie', 'convicts', 'get', 'just', 'deserts', 'suppose', 'not', 'make', 'up', 'what', 'parents', 'lost', 'bumbling', 'cops', 'were', 'perfect', 'compliament', 'tottaly', 'inept', 'foolish', 'mishandling', 'situation', 'cost', 'girls', 'lives', 'read', 'lot', 'reviews', 'where', 'people', 'complained', 'scense', 'claiming', 'did', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'comic', 'scenes', 'were', 'movie', 'Craven', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'tried', 'be', 'funny', 'Instead', 'should', 'have', 'concentrated', 'more', 'terror', 'people', 'are', 'retarded', 'have', 'sense', 'irony', 'scenes', 'cops', 'were', 'way', 'intended', 'be', 'funny', 'were', 'meant', 'illustrate', 'how', 'stupid', 'police', 'were', 'how', 'badly', 'handled', 'situation', 'happy', 'slapstick', 'music', 'banter', 'Sherieff', 'Deputy', 'was', 'meant', 'demonstrate', 'juvinille', 'country', 'bumpkin', 'absurd', 'mindstate', 'police', 'did', 'not', 'take', 'situation', 'serioulsy', 'why', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'serious', 'meant', 'contrast', 'horror', 'what', 'happening', 'teenaged', 'girl', 'woods', 'cops', 'are', 'goofing', 'teasing', 'other', 'innocent', 'lives', 'are', 'being', 'lost', 'also', 'liked', 'happy', 'music', 'Craven', 'used', 'contrasted', 'perfectly', 'dead', 'serious', 'situation', 'abuse', 'girls', 'woods', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'disturbing', 'music', 'hightened', 'tension', 'film', 'made', 'viewer', 'really', 'feel', 'horror', 'situation', 'even', 'more', 'movie', 'BAD', 'BAD', 'BAD', 'BAD', 'BAD', 'not', 'bad', 'low', 'quality', 'bad', 'EVIL', 'music', 'credits', 'was', 'really', 'distrubing', 'movie', 'was', 'hell', 'something', 'dont', 'know', 'movie', 'got', 'hard', 'do', 'have', 'seen', 'Spit', 'Your', 'Grave', 'was', 'just', 'basically', 'well', 'acted', 'rape', 'porn', 'revenge', 'twist', 'dont', 'know', 'what', 'movie', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'label', 'define', 'classification', 'not', 'horror', 'drama', 'action', 'just', 'EVIL', 'reviwers', 'gave', 'movie', 'bad', 'reviews', 'said', 'was', 'badly', 'acted', 'directed', 'pyschological', 'defense', 'mechanism', 'avoid', 'emotional', 'truama', 'movie', 'viwer', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'someone', 'would', 'hate', 'move', 'espically', 'women', 'feel', 'never', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'anyone', 'being', 'honest', 'can', 'flippanlty', 'disregard', 'claim', 'had', 'impact', 'was', 'funny', 'Only', 'really', 'really', 'sick', 'people', 'would', 'think', 'movie', 'was', 'funny', 'movie', 'CRAZY', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'movies', 'anymore', 'America', 'only', '1970s', 'where', 'directors', 'truly', 'free', 'really', 'push', 'limits', 'far', 'Craven', 'best', 'film', 'better', 'Scream', 'anything', 'else', 'ever', 'made', 'movie', 'R', 'rating', 'must', 'have', 'bribed', 'someone', 'get', 'movie', 'was', 'edited', 'know', 'are', 'scenes', 'violence', 'rape', 'were', 'cut', 'especially', 'scene', 'woods', 'Does', 'anyone', 'know', 'unrated', 'version', 'film']",N/A

Hilarious, well,  not exactly because they are after four dangerous escapees from a prison  who are trying to kill a few people, starting with two girls. He also makes  fun of grown-up hippies and their baby hippy girl. Fun, but this time it is  not funny ah ah, because those postmodern hippies open their own house to  the murderers of their own daughter, though they don't know about it, but  yet, these  guests  are not exactly model guests. Finally the victims  find themselves alone in front of the criminals and they have to improvise  some defense or some vengeance, and there Wes Craven uses his favorite art,  which is quoting situations and means from other films.

156224,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,079284632X,Jason,"[2, 3]","Perhaps one of the more memorable horror films of all time.  Known and remembered for not only being Wes Craven's first attempt at writing/directing, but also as a terrifying combination of disgusting depravities mixed with incredibly amateur acting, a completely laughable soundtrack, and some of the most inappropriate comical insertions in cinema history.Essentially it's a trend setter, possible one of the first to delve into the rape/revenge genre, and quite probably the grand-daddy of torture porn.  Similar to I Spit on Your Grave, which came out a few years later, Last House tackles the difficult subjects of rape and disembowelment.  Two beautiful victims fall into the hands of the absolute bottom scum of society, and from there it becomes a struggle to stay alive while the inbred criminals conjure up despicable means of physically and psychologically tormenting their victims.  It's quite difficult to see someone get tortured in such graphic fashion; there is the small appearance of snuff realism in every cringe-worthy scene.  On the other hand, vigilante justice is explored, something that seems to always grab the attention and approval of those disgusted by the previous atrocities.  In those two aspects, the movie shines.  In nearly everything else, the movie struggles.The soundtrack is one of the worst in history.  It's impossible to understand or describe, but picture a cat squealing on top of a braying donkey while being led by a laughing Fran Drescher at a small town carnival.  And those are the happy scenes.  Despite the tense performance by the lead villain Krug (David Hess), and a bizarrely schizophrenic Sadie (Jeramie Rain) who nearly giggles through the evil exacted upon the movie's victims, the acting is on par with a failing high school drama production.Overall, it's an average movie that looks incredibly aged when viewed today, but it was revolutionarily daring for the explotation horror genre, and therefore deserving of respect.One last note: Girls, easy on the teeth, please.",3,"Groundbreaking, but flawed",1237680000,"03 22, 2009",2009,2029,"['Perhaps', 'one', 'more', 'memorable', 'horror', 'films', 'time', 'Known', 'remembered', 'not', 'only', 'being', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'first', 'attempt', 'writing/directing', 'also', 'terrifying', 'combination', 'disgusting', 'depravities', 'mixed', 'incredibly', 'amateur', 'acting', 'completely', 'laughable', 'soundtrack', 'most', 'inappropriate', 'comical', 'insertions', 'cinema', 'history.Essentially', 'trend', 'setter', 'possible', 'one', 'first', 'delve', 'rape/revenge', 'genre', 'quite', 'probably', 'grand-daddy', 'torture', 'porn', 'Similar', 'Spit', 'Your', 'Grave', 'came', 'out', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'Last', 'House', 'difficult', 'subjects', 'rape', 'disembowelment', 'Two', 'beautiful', 'victims', 'fall', 'hands', 'absolute', 'bottom', 'scum', 'society', 'struggle', 'stay', 'alive', 'inbred', 'criminals', 'conjure', 'up', 'despicable', 'means', 'physically', 'psychologically', 'tormenting', 'victims', 'quite', 'difficult', 'see', 'someone', 'get', 'tortured', 'such', 'graphic', 'fashion', 'small', 'appearance', 'snuff', 'realism', 'cringe-worthy', 'scene', 'other', 'hand', 'vigilante', 'justice', 'explored', 'something', 'always', 'grab', 'attention', 'approval', 'disgusted', 'previous', 'atrocities', 'two', 'aspects', 'movie', 'shines', 'nearly', 'everything', 'else', 'movie', 'struggles.The', 'soundtrack', 'one', 'worst', 'history', 'impossible', 'understand', 'describe', 'picture', 'cat', 'squealing', 'top', 'braying', 'donkey', 'being', 'led', 'laughing', 'Fran', 'Drescher', 'small', 'town', 'carnival', 'are', 'happy', 'scenes', 'tense', 'performance', 'lead', 'villain', 'Krug', 'David', 'Hess', 'bizarrely', 'schizophrenic', 'Sadie', 'Jeramie', 'Rain', 'who', 'nearly', 'giggles', 'evil', 'exacted', 'movie', 'victims', 'acting', 'par', 'failing', 'high', 'school', 'drama', 'production.Overall', 'average', 'movie', 'incredibly', 'aged', 'when', 'viewed', 'today', 'was', 'revolutionarily', 'daring', 'explotation', 'horror', 'genre', 'therefore', 'deserving', 'respect.One', 'last', 'note', 'Girls', 'easy', 'teeth', 'please']",N/A

The Last House on the Left is the worst movie I have ever seen. I consider myself a pretty big fan of the horror genre, but this film just has absolutely no redeeming qualities. The direction is second-rate, the acting is an abomination and the soundtrack is deranged. This film should not even be mentioned in the same breath as the Texas Chainsaw Massacre which is (in my opinion) the best horror film ever made. Last House is not scary, disturbing or even interesting. The violence is presented so non-chalantly that the viewer is not in anyway shocked. The rape scenes (with a few quick edits) could play on network TV. What this film really reminded me of was a cross between the Brady Bunch, MacGyver(setting up the booby traps) and a jail break film. I mean, the parents just simply become savage killers with little to no evidence that these people killed their daughter? I never thought I would find the bottom of the barrel in the horror genre, but The Last House on the Left somehow manages to take that crown easily. Avoid at all costs!

156229,AZ1UFPNARPZD2,079284632X,"Jeffrey Ellis ""bored recluse""","[12, 12]","This is one of those films that are difficult to explain or defend.  While the film actually is based on The Virgin Spring (as opposed to Roger Corman's liberal use of Egdar Allan Poe's legacy to try to give a hint of art to his Vincent Price films in the early '60s) and Wes Craven's stated intentions about making a comment on the state of American society at the time do seem to be sincere, its still a hard film to really recommend.  Basically, two teenage girls from the middle class are kidnapped, raped, and brutally murdered by a pack of degenerates who are then just as brutally and sadistically murdered by the girl's family.  What set the film apart is the extreme (and close-to-realistic) nature of the gore and violence involved.  People literally have gotten sick while watching this film and for good reason.  I saw an edited version and still found it hard to take.  As well, Craven makes it clear that the criminals and the avenging parents are pretty much only distinguishable by their social class.  The parents, by the end of the film, take the same sadistic pleasure in their revenge that their victims took in their original crime.  Its a grim message and not an extremely pleasant one.  It also might be a lot more truthful than a lot of people want to admit.  Still, I can't really recommend this film for that message.  To get to it, you have to sit through some really repugnant, sadistic stuff and its hard to say that Craven's artistic intent can really be used as justification.  (I guess the main problem is that I got the feeling that the filmmakers were basically getting off on the same violence they claimed to be condemning.)  This is the type of film that everyone will have to make up their own minds on.  So, in the end, a film that painfully betrays its low budget but manages to carry a very disturbing power to it and claims to, at least, contain a message that is still relavent.  Not for anyone with a weak stomach but if you're a fan of gore films, (I'm not but I won't condemn anyone who is -- sometimes excess and shock has an understandable appeal) Last House is kind of required viewing.  It doesn't really work as a horror film (I was never really scared as much as disturbed) but it does have a primitive, very raw power.  Whether to see it is your own decision.  I don't regret having watched it but at the same time, its not something I ever want to sit through again.",3,Difficult film to explain...,1001894400,"10 1, 2001",2001,2420,"['one', 'films', 'are', 'difficult', 'explain', 'defend', 'film', 'actually', 'based', 'Virgin', 'Spring', 'opposed', 'Roger', 'Corman', 'liberal', 'use', 'Egdar', 'Allan', 'Poe', 'legacy', 'try', 'give', 'hint', 'art', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'films', 'early', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'stated', 'intentions', 'making', 'comment', 'state', 'American', 'society', 'time', 'do', 'seem', 'be', 'sincere', 'still', 'hard', 'film', 'really', 'recommend', 'Basically', 'two', 'teenage', 'girls', 'middle', 'class', 'are', 'kidnapped', 'raped', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'pack', 'degenerates', 'who', 'are', 'then', 'just', 'brutally', 'sadistically', 'murdered', 'girl', 'family', 'What', 'set', 'film', 'apart', 'extreme', 'close-to-realistic', 'nature', 'gore', 'violence', 'involved', 'People', 'literally', 'have', 'gotten', 'sick', 'watching', 'film', 'good', 'reason', 'saw', 'edited', 'version', 'still', 'found', 'hard', 'take', 'As', 'well', 'Craven', 'clear', 'criminals', 'avenging', 'parents', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'only', 'distinguishable', 'social', 'class', 'parents', 'end', 'film', 'take', 'same', 'sadistic', 'pleasure', 'revenge', 'victims', 'took', 'original', 'crime', 'grim', 'message', 'not', 'extremely', 'pleasant', 'one', 'also', 'might', 'be', 'lot', 'more', 'truthful', 'lot', 'people', 'want', 'admit', 'Still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'recommend', 'film', 'message', 'get', 'have', 'sit', 'really', 'repugnant', 'sadistic', 'stuff', 'hard', 'say', 'Craven', 'artistic', 'intent', 'can', 'really', 'be', 'used', 'justification', 'guess', 'main', 'problem', 'got', 'feeling', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'basically', 'getting', 'off', 'same', 'violence', 'claimed', 'be', 'condemning', 'type', 'film', 'everyone', 'will', 'have', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'minds', 'So', 'end', 'film', 'painfully', 'low', 'budget', 'carry', 'very', 'disturbing', 'power', 'claims', 'least', 'contain', 'message', 'still', 'relavent', 'Not', 'anyone', 'weak', 'stomach', ""'re"", 'fan', 'gore', 'films', ""'m"", 'not', 'wo', ""n't"", 'condemn', 'anyone', 'who', 'sometimes', 'excess', 'shock', 'understandable', 'appeal', 'Last', 'House', 'kind', 'required', 'viewing', ""n't"", 'really', 'work', 'horror', 'film', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'scared', 'as', 'much', 'disturbed', 'have', 'primitive', 'very', 'raw', 'power', 'Whether', 'see', 'own', 'decision', 'do', ""n't"", 'regret', 'having', 'watched', 'same', 'time', 'not', 'something', 'ever', 'want', 'sit', 'through', 'again']",N/A
156230,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,079284632X,Jeffrey Leach,"[6, 6]","Many horror fans consider &quot;The Last House on the Left&quot; a major cult classic, a movie that changed forever the very conceptions of the genre. Made in the early 1970s on a shoestring budget, the movie boasts several memorable performances, gritty urban set pieces contrasted with scenes shot in peaceful woods, gruesome violence, and teeth gritting psychological torture. If praise for &quot;The Last House on the Left&quot; rested solely upon these merits, the movie would differ very little from other cult classic shock-o-ramas like &quot;I Spit on Your Grave,&quot; or &quot;The Hills Have Eyes.&quot; What makes the film a cut above the rest, if you can say that without groaning, are the filmmakers involved in the project. None other than Wes Craven and Sean Cunningham wrote and lensed this motion picture. Craven, as even non-horror fans know, went on to worldwide success with the &quot;Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; and &quot;Scream&quot; franchises. Cunningham, less known outside the world of slasher cinema, was the guiding light behind the first (and best) &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; film. &quot;The Last House on the Left&quot; was the first real project for both men. The movie made a killing at the box office in the days when filmmakers could still distribute films to small theater chains.The plot is ghastly in its simplicity. Two attractive young girls, Mari and Phyllis, plan on heading into the city to have some fun. Once there, they unfortunately approach an escaped convict in order to procure some drugs. The guy, some wild haired loony heroin addict referred to as Junior, sweet talks the girls up to an apartment where his compatriots are hiding. These escapees are desperate people--there's the leader of the gang, the sadistic thug Krug Stillo (David Hess), the razor thin psycho Fred &quot;The Weasel&quot; Podowski, and Sadie, the gang's moll. All four of these outcasts are fugitives from the law, but cannot help planning further egregious crimes when they catch sight of the two girls. They end up driving the hapless gals out into the woods where the gang proceeds to mentally and physically torture them. It's not necessary to go into specifics about the horrible deeds perpetrated on these two nice looking young ladies except to say it's pretty horrible. Craven and Cunningham even show some of the more objectionable scenes up close in vivid color (and outtakes on the disc provide an even closer view of the general nastiness). What is of interest takes place after the gang disposes of their victims. You see, Mari's parents just happen to live on the edge of these very woods, and a very interesting exchange occurs when the gang happens to turn up on their victim's doorstep looking for shelter.Mari's parents have been worried sick about their missing daughter. Since they are decent, upright citizens, they call in the local police (one of the cops played by Martin Kove, by the way) and file a missing persons report. Still, no Mari. When their daughter's killers show up posing as traveling salesmen, these decent folks invite them right in. They even feed the quartet of goons and offer to put them up for the night. Well, one thing leads to another, and it isn't too long before Mari's parents figure out these people bear the responsibility for their daughter's disappearance. Since they can't reach the bumbling cops, Mom and Dad decide to take matters into their own hands. The two sneak about the house setting up elaborate traps to ensnare the unwary murderers, things like setting up trip wires and slicking up the hallway floor with shaving cream. Mom takes an extra step I would rather not talk about on a public forum, but you get the general idea. The trap springs, chaos ensues, and several brutal murders take place as Mari's parents make the killers reap the whirlwind. And that, my friends, is a brief, highly censored summary of &quot;The Last House on the Left.&quot;Does the film deserve its cult status? Are Craven and Cunningham worthy of the accolades heaped on this movie? Yes and no. Yes, the film does work well in achieving a sort of sleazy atmosphere through extreme violence and an over the top, menacing performance from Hess. However, I think the negatives outweigh the positives. First, the background music is wildly inappropriate for the film, with its twangy guitar and saccharine sweet lyrics. Second, the pacing drags horribly in spots, especially during the extended chase scenes between the gang and the two teenagers in the forest. Third, the entire subplot concerning the blundering cops feels wrong. The movie constantly cuts away from the unfolding nightmare to show the sheriff and his deputy running out of gas on the highway or trying to hitch a ride on a truck loaded with chickens. The movie plays these scenes for humor and it just doesn't fit; it's like putting Three Stooges' footage in a documentary about ethnic cleansing.The DVD comes with a ton of extras, including a commentary from Craven and Cunningham, interviews with cast and crew, trailers, stills, outtakes, a widescreen picture transfer, and some other stuff. After watching these extras, it becomes apparent quite quickly that the movie succeeded primarily due to slick marketing rather than content. Still, I guess the film does make a statement about violence in America, and it did help Craven and Cunningham find other opportunities for their twisted imaginations. Where would we be, after all, without Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees (don't answer; it's a rhetorical question!)? Give it a go if you want to see an early influence on the genre, but I recommend you dive into H.G. Lewis if you want to see early films that made a bigger splash in the horror field.",3,Influential yet largely ho-hum,1079049600,"03 12, 2004",2004,5742,"['Many', 'horror', 'fans', 'consider', 'quot',

""A New Yorker""","[2, 3]","I've heard a lot about this movie through my friendly pack and have the Nightmare on Elm Street collection on DVD which Wes talks about this movie, how it was one of his first and a great learning experience. After I watched this film I`ve notice not only is this film categorize in the wrong genre but the disc jacket doesn't even fit the films profile. So tell me where in the world was that house in the story and why did they have to place a ghost on the corner of the picture.I can see how creepy and disturbing this film is but Wes didn't have to go there and mislead the viewers like that.....that ain't right. Anyway, here we have Marri (Sandra Cassel) who is a 17 year girl who sets out with her friend Lucy (Phyllis Stone) for a rock concert. They decide to attempt to find a little ""grass"" before the concert and are tricked into accompanying a young man (Marc Sheffler) who promises good ""Columbian"", but instead leads them to the hideout of three fugitives. The girls are abducted at knife point and taken out into the woods where they graphically humiliated, tortured, and murdered. As a poor attempt by Craven at irony, these acts occur near Mari's home where her parents are frantic about their missing daughter.This film was not a ""masterpiece of horror,"" but it was a simple little exploitation film. The performances featured here was sort of gritty, realistic, and natural (mainly by the two girls). Craven's documentary style lent to this work a specific realism which made it seem more like you were there watching it, or watching it on the news, rather than subscribing to the Mantra. One thing I have to question is the parent because at first they appear as your typical over protective conservative parents. Then they turn into horny love birds. Their daughter is missing, but didn't seem to care at one point. They call the police, both policemen are incompetent by the way, and that's it. Mari's parents offer hospitality to the four criminals when they come to their home seeking help, but when Mari's mother and father learn their daughter has been murdered and the four are responsible, they exact their revenge and  go Texas Chainsaw Massacre on them. It's crazy. I've seen a lot of homage's though to this film likeStraw Dogs, andI Spit On Your Grave (Millennium Edition). Over all, it's not the worst movie I've seen, but it is twisted and disturbing. I'm telling parents; do not let your children watch this!

In many ways this is an amateurish effort with a lot of new and then unknown actors, but I think it is ultimately a better story than Nightmare on Elm Street or Scream.Last House on the Left is so scary because it's realistic, notwithstanding some of the contrived circumstances in the story (such as the torture and murder of the girls being carried out so close to the home of the concerned parents). It's realistic because the villains are not otherworldly, invulnerable beings. They are common thugs who have lost all sense of empathy or mercy. They remind one of the Manson family or the Nazis who performed horrific experiments on their victims or casually executed them.While watching this, there were times I was shouting out at the helplessness of the victims, the ineptitude of the police, or just for vengeance on the cruel and pestilent villains.

Lind,"[1, 1]","Blu-ray transfer detail level is limited by the movie having been shot using Super 16mm film. 35mm theatrical prints are ""blow-ups"" (enlargements) of the original 16mm negative. The level of detail (lack thereof) and film grain would have been obvious when 35mm prints prints enlarged from the 16mm original negative were projected in theaters. The coarseness and grain is very evident in the Blu-ray transfer which is quite good. It's not a result of the transfer process, it's the original film and its limitations. Likewise, audio quality is very limited by the original monaural audio fidelity (lack thereof). While the fidelity isn't there (frequency and dynamic ranges), pops, hiss, etc. have been cleaned up. Given the movie being created on Super 16mm with mediocre fidelity monaural audio, and that it has survived oblivion by becoming a ""cult"" film, it's easy to understand why it wasn't transferred to Blu-ray until now.Regarding the film's subject matter and content, the first thing one notices (now) are the early 1970's clothing styles, mens hair length, slang terms, and the music. This is most definitely an utterly unabashed ""exploitation"" horror movie. It comes complete with a generous helping of cliches and the obvious plot setups. In short, one can see the evil coming. It's not a matter whether or not something horrid will occur, it's a matter of what it will be and how depraved. The actors are quite mediocre, with some outright laughable (the sheriff and his deputy in particular). This was Wes Craven's *first* feature length film, and it was done using Super 16mm format with a total budget under $90,000 which is quite small (hence the smaller and much cheaper film size). This shows in every aspect throughout the entire film. Classic Craven in storyline, but plenty rough around the edges compared to later works like ""Nightmare on Elm Street,"" or ""Scream.""Giving it 3 stars. The basic plot is quite good.

It is awesome when his father finally convinces him to blow his brains out with a gun. And he does it! Wonderful.Every family has a `weird' uncle. This movie portrays him as yet another gang member. He wears bad suits, has bad hair, and looks like a pedophile. He plays the part well, too well. I think the guy was like this in real life.You can tell the two girls in the woods are having a good time at the mercy of their future killers. One girl is told to pee her pants and she does. Then they are forced to get it on with each other. Anyway one tries to make a break for it and is stabbed repeatedly. The other girl is shot. No loss really, they weren't that attractive.The final revenge scenes are awesome. I really want to try the wet carpet plugged into the wall trick. That looked neat. Now when the mom dishes out her revenge on Uncle Charlie, it will make every guy wince and turn away.

They are kidnapped by a really sick group of escaped convicts.  These guys torture, mutilate, drug, and rape these girls.  This is a movie that may require you to detach yourself from what you're seeing on the screen in order to minimize the negative impact it might have on you mentally.  In other words, view it as just a movie in order to soften the impact.  On the other hand, one really doesn't need to TRY to detach themselves and downplay everything because the acting and music in this movie will do the job for you, because it's THAT BAD.  When I watched this movie, I found that I was getting a big kick out of the poor acting and especially the music.  The music alone served as a distraction away from the sick brutality that was on the screen.  Let me tell you, the music is THAT BAD.  The movie is bad to begin with, but the music just totally seals its doom.  The music is very cheesy - it reminds me of music you'd hear on some TV show from the early '70s, like maybe The Partridge Family or The Brady Bunch, something along those lines.  The music doesn't fit the movie at all.  To further illustrate, imagine watching The Waltons and having John Williams' Star Wars soundtrack playing.  That's how much the music doesn't match up.  To make matters worse, there are scenes that are meant to provide comic relief, but they end up making me laugh at the actors who are trying to provide the comic relief.This is one of those movies that has that late '60s/early '70s hippie counterculture feel to it, where it seems the characters are on an LSD trip and the movie itself is psychedelic in nature.  I wonder what drugs Wes Craven was on when he made this movie.  Then again, maybe he wasn't on drugs.  Maybe he just wanted to make a sick and disturbing movie.  Whatever the case, this movie isn't one I recommend.  It's a cult classic and even a remake was done recently, but no, I certainly don't recommend the original.",2,"Twisted, bizarre, sick, cheesy, very early '70s-ish",1292976000,"12 22, 2010",2010,2043,"['Do', 'sick', 'movies', 'plot', 'basically', 'two', 'teenage', 'girls', 'are', 'way', 'rock', 'concert', 'are', 'kidnapped', 'really', 'sick', 'group', 'escaped', 'convicts', 'guys', 'torture', 'mutilate', 'drug', 'rape', 'girls', 'movie', 'may', 'require', 'detach', 'what', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'screen', 'order', 'minimize', 'negative', 'impact', 'might', 'have', 'mentally', 'other', 'words', 'view', 'just', 'movie', 'order', 'soften', 'impact', 'other', 'hand', 'one', 'really', ""n't"", 'need', 'TRY', 'detach', 'downplay', 'everything', 'acting', 'music', 'movie', 'will', 'do', 'job', 'BAD', 'When', 'watched', 'movie', 'found', 'was', 'getting', 'big', 'kick', 'poor', 'acting', 'especially', 'music', 'music', 'alone', 'served', 'distraction', 'away', 'sick', 'brutality', 'was', 'screen', 'Let', 'tell', 'music', 'BAD', 'movie', 'bad', 'begin', 'music', 'just', 'totally', 'doom', 'music', 'very', 'cheesy', 'music', ""'d"", 'hear', 'TV', 'show', 'early', ""'70s"", 'maybe', 'Partridge', 'Family', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'something', 'lines', 'music', ""n't"", 'fit', 'movie', 'further', 'illustrate', 'imagine', 'watching', 'Waltons', 'having', 'John', 'Williams', 'Star', 'Wars', 'soundtrack', 'playing', 'how', 'much', 'music', ""n't"", 'match', 'up', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'are', 'scenes', 'are', 'meant', 'provide', 'comic', 'relief', 'end', 'up', 'making', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'provide', 'comic', 'relief.This', 'one', 'movies', 'late', ""'60s/early"", 'hippie', 'counterculture', 'feel', 'where', 'characters', 'are', 'LSD', 'trip', 'movie', 'psychedelic', 'nature', 'wonder', 'what', 'drugs', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'was', 'when', 'made', 'movie', 'Then', 'again', 'maybe', 'was', ""n't"", 'drugs', 'Maybe', 'just', 'wanted', 'make', 'sick', 'disturbing', 'movie', 'case', 'movie', ""n't"", 'one', 'recommend', 'cult', 'classic', 'even', 'remake', 'was', 'done', 'recently', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'original']",N/A

Perrotta ""screamqueen73""","[2, 3]","Okay, this is an incredibly cheesy, low-budget film which doesn't have very many redeeming qualities besides the fact that it has a very Helter Skelter feel to it. As I was watching it, it occurred to me that Craven, consciously or unconsciously, was writing a documentary heavily inspired by the Manson family and murders. The callousness and frenzied acts of ruthless murder strike me as probably being very similar to the way the Manson murders went down. BUT the problems with this film are MANY. The base gore and violence, the lousy character development, the very obvious GOOD v. EVIL theme and the cheap attempts to ""shock"" the audience take so much away from its integrity for it ever to be considered a great horror film. The writers/directors seem to have not been able to decide what kind of movie they wanted to make: a horror film, a spoof of a horror film, a snuff film, a slapstick comedy or a porno. Since they couldn't decide which way they were going, they just threw all of those elements in, in an extremely haphazard way. Tactics such as graphic rape, forced urination, disembowling, oral removal of sexual organs etc., are so forced, it is just so obvious that the directors were simply intending to push the barriers of film making and say ""@#$% the rules"". Throwing conventionality to the wind is a great thing for film makers but at the same time, the director/writers seem to be enjoying this agony a little too much to believe they were simply showing the reality of modern violence without glorifying it quite a bit.

156261,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,079284632X,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[17, 23]","There is an interesting comparison to be made between Ingmar Bergman's classic ""The Virgin Spring"" and the grisly exploitation shocker it inspired, ""Last House on the Left"" by Wes Craven.  They share identical plots, feature graphic rape scenes, and before it's all over turn average men into murderers.  And yet one is considered to be a bona fide classic and 1961's Oscar-winning Best Foreign Film--and the other appreciated only in underground circles, but largely reviled as cheap gruesome exploitation.So just how different are they?  Not as different as you might imagine--but as different as art and exploitation.""The Virgin Spring"" is easily one of Bergman's most accessible films.  Telling a simple story in a straightforward fashion, he exposes a frankness and brutality people weren't accustomed to seeing.  A young girl venturing through the woods encounters two men and a boy.  Though they initially seem helpful, their actions quickly become violent.  After a graphic (for the time) rape, the girl is murdered.  Later, the wrongdoers happen upon the girl's home and seek shelter from her family--both groups unaware of who the other is.  Suspicions start to arise and vengeance is sought.It is a powerful tale of love, loss and the depths people can be driven into--where they become unable to stop themselves from betraying their faith and moral code, where savagery and rage take over.  Bergman's film benefits greatly from a stellar lead performance by Max von Sydow as the father.  Real conflict and raw emotion burn up the screen.  Add the beautiful cinematography and haunting score and it's a winning combination.  But what endures in the story of ""The Virgin Spring"" is how strong a component faith becomes--when there is nothing left to believe in, can you still believe?  A classic in every sense, ""The Virgin Spring"" still has the power to shock but there's something very redemptive about the film.""Last House on the Left,"" however, is probably more notorious than acclaimed.  The plot, as I've said, is identical.  Coming 12 years later, in 1972, Wes Craven was at the beginning of his career and sought to retell this tale.  It is a shocker, and the scenes of rape and murder clearly foreshadow the ""torture cinema"" of today.  It is brutal, uncompromising and graphic--and the film was championed in the underground horror market.Working with a small budget, the film lacks the artistry of ""The Virgin Spring.""  While it still packs a visceral punch and has the power to shock--what it lacks is depth and subtlety.  The characters aren't particularly drawn out so their actions don't have the emotional resonance of the earlier film.  Without contemplating faith and moral choices, what we're left with is straightforward revenge.  And the film, ultimately, has no redemption--no uplift.  It's violence for the sake of violence.  It remains a historically significant precursor and influence on other shock films without being a particularly good movie in it's own right.And therein lies the difference between art and exploitation.

The infamous film gained quite a cult following since it's release in the 1970's and is still admired by fans of the genre today. The film is a violent journey into murder, rape, torture and humiliation like few other films have captured before. The movie has such a raw realism to it that it's hard not to wince at certain scenes, even for horror vets like myself. Make no mistake, if you are easily offended or are against violence in films than this is not your cup of tea.The movie is about Mari and her friend Phyllis going to a rock concert in a bad part of town. They try to score some grass and end up getting kidnapped by a band of fugitives freshly escaped from prison. And the movie goes from there. (I don't want to spoil anything for those of you who haven't seen it)The movie is expertly filmed and the acting is very strong. Really creating the realism that Wes was shooting for. The soundtrack is laugh out loud great really bringing to life the time period that this movie took place in. David Hess does a fantastic job as usual playing the leader of a band of psychos. (For another great gem with Hess, check out ""House on the Edge of the Park"") The film is a very powerful and raw look into the horrors that real life can bring. It's disturbing and downright mean. Pure Genious and a masterpiece of American film making.The dvd looks about as good as a movie from 1970 can. There are some issues with the picture, but it's acceptable for the time period. The audio could be better. Included in the extras are a commentary track with Wes and some documentaries. I haven't had the chance to watch them yet, but they sound very good.This one is for Horror/Terror film fans only. If you're not a huge fan of horror you probably won't like this film. But for all of us out there who love these movies, we are in for a treat.

But the film proved so controversial and caused people so much discomfort that theatre owners and projectionists cut each copy of the film to keep audiences from over-reacting.  The plot is absolutely clear from the ads promoting the film:  A young woman is dying in the woods.  What happens next?  LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT is one of the few films that actually tries to express what violent acts not only do to the victims but also the perpetrators.  When the parents of one of the victims find out that their daughter's killers are staying in their house, they exact their own VIOLENT revenge.  Many people hate this film for its depiction of torture and violence, yet Hollywood keeps churning out revenge pics with glowing critical support.

156271,ASSKHS3FV3J0H,079284632X,"Lillian Patterson ""Post-Postmodern Angster""","[22, 33]","People warned me that this film was graphic.  They told me that it was disturbing.  They explained that the scenes of torture and rape were brutal.  But they never warned me how hideously STUPID this movie is.  Come on, people!  Give me a break.First, I appreciate what Wes Craven was trying to do.  With the obviously 10-20 dollar budget he had, he was trying to show the sadistic madmen intruding upon idyllic small town life and the effect that this can have on ""ordinary"" small town people.  I appreciate how he was trying to show the young gir'l parents taking revenge for this brutal crime.  I'm not a horror-phobe, graphic scenes don't intimidate me, I applaud what he was trying to do.  I think the reason that this movie offends me so much is that it so thrououghly ruins its excellant premise.Someone mentioned the scenes of the ""bumbling cops"" that are interspersed with the scenes of the young girls being tortured.  What no one mentions is that these scenes totally RUIN any chance the torture scenes had to be disturbing.  And this film has the single WORST score I have EVER heard for any movie.  I have never pushed the mute button on my TV before while watching a movie, but in this case I had developed a migraine from the music, and by the fifth or sixth time I heard those horrible, campy lyrics (you heard me, lyrics--some apparently written specially to go along with the film) I couldn't take it any more.  This is how you know I am a true horror fan willing to give this film a chance--instead of turning the movie off, I muted it.  Besides, I knew that I wasn't going to miss any insightful dialogue by pushing the mute button.  The actors in this movie are so horribly inept that it's difficult to suspend disbelief for any length of time (don't worry, you won't EVER have to remind yourself that it's only a movie, the filmmakers kindly do this for you).Yes, some of the scenes are brutal and disturbing, but every time you start to connect with any of the characters, the film immediately cuts to a scene of ""comic relief"" or begins to play that horrible, grating music again.  Come on, Wes Craven!  Even on a first film, you should have known better than this!  These scenes and music are supposed to relieve the tension, but not if they interfere before tension can even be built.And the revenge of the parents.  It almost redeems the rest of the film, because it is graphic and shocking (except that everyone has told me what happens, so I wasn't surprised).  And for once, the male character (the father) is weak and the female character (the mother) is strong, and she gets the job done.  These scenes are effective.  The only things that runied this for me were the major plot holes that occured at about this time in the story.In short, I know people will hate this review for degrading what many consider to be a classic.  I really do appreciate what Wes Craven was trying to do with this film, and I only want to warn people who may want to waste an hour and a half of their lives watching this film.  If you think you have to see it, you should.  But don't say I didn't warn you.  Oh yes, and bring earplugs--that might prevent your mute button from being worn out.",1,No One Warned Me...,1027728000,"07 27, 2002",2002,3203,"['People', 'warned', 'film', 'was', 'graphic', 'told', 'was', 'disturbing', 'explained', 'scenes', 'torture', 'rape', 'were', 'brutal', 'never', 'warned', 'how', 'hideously', 'STUPID', 'movie', 'Come', 'people', 'Give', 'break.First', 'appreciate', 'what', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'obviously', '10-20', 'dollar', 'budget', 'had', 'was', 'trying', 'show', 'sadistic', 'madmen', 'intruding', 'idyllic', 'small', 'town', 'life', 'effect', 'can', 'have', 'ordinary', 'small', 'town', 'people', 'appreciate', 'how', 'was', 'trying', 'show', 'young', 'gir', 'l', 'parents', 'taking', 'revenge', 'brutal', 'crime', ""'m"", 'not', 'horror-phobe', 'graphic', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'intimidate', 'applaud', 'what', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'think', 'reason', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'so', 'thrououghly', 'excellant', 'premise.Someone', 'mentioned', 'scenes', 'bumbling', 'cops', 'are', 'interspersed', 'scenes', 'young', 'girls', 'being', 'tortured', 'What', 'one', 'scenes', 'totally', 'RUIN', 'chance', 'torture', 'scenes', 'had', 'be', 'disturbing', 'film', 'single', 'WORST', 'score', 'have', 'EVER', 'heard', 'movie', 'have', 'never', 'pushed', 'mute', 'button', 'TV', 'watching', 'movie', 'case', 'had', 'developed', 'migraine', 'music', 'fifth', 'sixth', 'time', 'heard', 'horrible', 'campy', 'lyrics', 'heard', 'lyrics', 'apparently', 'written', 'specially', 'go', 'along', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'take', 'more', 'how', 'know', 'am', 'true', 'horror', 'fan', 'willing', 'give', 'film', 'chance', 'instead', 'turning', 'movie', 'muted', 'knew', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'miss', 'insightful', 'dialogue', 'pushing', 'mute', 'button', 'actors', 'movie', 'are', 'so', 'horribly', 'difficult', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'length', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'wo', ""n't"", 'EVER', 'have', 'remind', 'only', 'movie', 'filmmakers', 'kindly', 'do', '.Yes', 'scenes', 'are', 'brutal', 'disturbing', 'time', 'start', 'connect', 'characters', 'film', 'immediately', 'scene', 'comic', 'relief', 'play', 'horrible', 'grating', 'music', 'again', 'Come', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'Even', 'first', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'better', 'scenes', 'music', 'are', 'supposed', 'relieve', 'tension', 'not', 'interfere', 'tension', 'can', 'even', 'be', 'revenge', 'parents', 'almost', 'rest', 'film', 'graphic', 'shocking', 'everyone', 'told', 'what', 'was', ""n't"", 'surprised', 'once', 'male', 'character', 'father', 'weak', 'female', 'character', 'mother', 'strong', 'job', 'done', 'scenes', 'are', 'effective', 'only', 'things', 'runied', 'were', 'major', 'plot', 'holes', 'occured', 'time', 'story.In', 'short', 'know', 'people', 'will', 'hate', 'review', 'degrading', 'what', 'many', 'consider', 'be', 'classic', 'really', 'do', 'appreciate', 'what', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'film', 'only', 'want', 'warn', 'people', 'who', 'may', 'want', 'waste', 'hour', 'half', 'lives', 'watching', 'film', 'think', 'have', 'see', 'should', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'warn', 'Oh', 'yes', 'bring', 'earplugs', 'might', 'prevent', 'mute', 'button', 'being', 'worn', 'out']",N/A

Anyway, I do not know what the fascination for the 1970's is with many people, but I am one of those who love that decade in particular. I think that pop culture has not really changed ALL that much since then.I was just an innocent teenager in high school who had a fascination with horror films (and still do) when I first rented the movie. I found it very shocking and disturbing, of course. It was a movie that stayed with me for years. I knew even then that the movie was low budget, it had SOME bad acting, and some flaws, but there were also something about it that left a lasting impression on me. I am nothing like the killers of course, and could easily see that I had much in common with character of ""Mari"" (another spelling of ""Mary"") in the film. I just found it so frightening and disturbing that such people as ""Krug"" and his companions could exist in the world. ""Mari"" was obviously sheltered and sweet and I think she tended to see the world through rose-colored glasses. The other girl, ""Phyllis,"" was much wiser to the ways of the world and much tougher.Of course I do not enjoy seeing rape or violence, but the strongest part of the film is the middle part when the girls are taken to the woods and tormented, raped and eventually murdered. The scene where one of the girls is forced to urinate was very personal and difficult to watch. What a cheap but very effective thing that was.The latter part of the film is more funny than scary. I believe the first part of the film is the weakest and worst part. If one could just get through that (and through the fashions of the times), then it is possible to find some redeeming things about this film. I do not think it's a bad first attempt at a horror film.Also, I liked David Hess as ""Krug."" He did quite well. He had a very strong presence, I thought. Was his music all that bad? ""The road leads to nowhere"" (or whatever the title is) sounds very 1970's and dated to me, but the song was actually right for the film, don't ya think? I hated it too when I first heard it, but now I do not think about the music when I watch the film anymore. It is just there in the background.By the way, ""The Virgin Spring"" was actually the inspiration for this film (as many of you probably know). Also, the title really has nothing to do with the movie, but I agree that it gives a little bit of an air of intrigue and mystery. So what about the last house on the left?

Gary Buglass,"[26, 53]","Because I am in the UK, this movie was banned from when it was first released and never given proper censorship to be released - until now. I have to say I was disappointed.Two 17 year old girls head out to catch a concert but on their way home they are captured by 4 escaped convicts and they are dragged into the woods not 20 yards from their house where they are subjected to severe brutality - rape, torture, humiliation and disembowerment before finally being killed in a very quick scene that lacks tension.I defy anyone to watch it and NOT feel emotionally disturbed. I do think Wes Craven's idea to release it was ""here's a movie that pushes the boundaries - watch it if you dare"". And he succeeded. Although I said above it's a lousy movie it's not because of what happens - it's how it's FILMED.The sheer fact that two young girls are subjected to ruthless brutality by psychos across the street from their house while their parents give a statement to the local sheriff in their livingroom is so disturbing, it makes your heart ache.It makes the viewer hooked on what's happening and feel sorrow for the victims and their parents who don't even know it's going on across the street from their own home. That's what a movie is all about - getting the audience hooked and interested - it's just a pity this one was handled badly. If this movie was re-made today with famous actors it would be an instant classic. This version is let down by poor direction,terrible music, some bad acting and a few comic moments that are so distracting it veers away from the horror that's supposed to be the imperative ingredient of the movie. Apart from the comic moments in it, the acting lets it down. The parents don't seem too worried that their daughter failed to come home 24 hours after a concert she went to, and when they find her body in the woods their reaction to the discovery of her death is very sketchilly performed.Wes Craven is a master horror filmaker - but with this he should have tried harder, without the comic elements.

Sadly, I am very shocked that this is even considered a horror movie, much less a classic in Horror.Here is what displeasedmeabout this movie:1.) The acting always seemed as if the actors had just gotten their lines moments before the cameras rolled.2.) The story, while a good one, was displayed quite poorly...characters would finish talking yet the scene would linger for several more seconds, ""graphic"" scenes would suddenly cut to ""comedic"" scenes or a scenes regarding a different part of the storyline, then come back to the ""graphic"" scene again. (Note that I put the words graphic and comedic in quotations; that is because the scenes were neither graphic nor comedic, though they obviously were trying), and there was never any moments in my viewing where I felt any level of psychological or tense drama.3.) The music was often upbeat, even in scenes that were supposed to be dramatic. In fact, the music was just plain terrible all through this movie.4.) Plot Holes! The villans are shown in clothes that have gotten quite dirty and messy, their car had broken down so they're stuck in the woods, yet when they go to the Mari's Parent's home up the hill, they somehow managed to aquire clean, almost business-like clothes, hair combed and no sign of dirt on them anywhere. That must have been a hell of a magical spring they were splashing in, in the previous scene.And the main female villan (or would that be ""villaness""?) manages to go from a sort of ""afro"" hair style, to straight hair, and a couple other styles SOMETIMES WITHIN SECONDS BETWEEN SCENES!And unless I totally missed something, it was never explained HOW Mari's parents knew where to find their daughter.There are several topless and bottomless scenes, mostly in the rape and humiliation scenes, and even THOSE scenes are not done well.This is truly a bad film, done by guys who thankfully got MUCH better at the genre later.",1,Glad I got it for just $5 at WalMart.,1284768000,"09 18, 2010",2010,2370,"['serious', 'horror', 'fan', 'have', 'heard', 'Last', 'House', 'Left', 'many', 'times', 'though', 'had', 'not', 'ever', 'seen', 'it.I', 'found', '5', 'DVDs', 'shelf', 'had', 'named', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'Sean', 'Cunningham', 'Steve', 'Miner', 'attached', 'thought', 'had', 'found', 'gem', 'charcoal', 'price.Having', 'now', 'watched', 'pretty', 'much', 'got', 'exactly', 'what', 'paid', 'for.The', 'acting', 'sometimes', 'not', 'important', 'when', 'Horror', 'as', 'long', 'story', 'effects', 'are', 'good', 'Sadly', 'am', 'very', 'shocked', 'even', 'considered', 'horror', 'movie', 'much', 'less', 'classic', 'Horror.Here', 'what', 'movie:1', 'acting', 'always', 'seemed', 'actors', 'had', 'just', 'gotten', 'lines', 'moments', 'cameras', 'rolled.2', 'story', 'good', 'one', 'was', 'displayed', 'quite', 'poorly', 'characters', 'would', 'finish', 'talking', 'yet', 'scene', 'would', 'linger', 'several', 'more', 'seconds', 'graphic', 'scenes', 'would', 'suddenly', 'cut', 'comedic', 'scenes', 'scenes', 'regarding', 'different', 'part', 'storyline', 'then', 'come', 'back', 'graphic', 'scene', 'again', 'Note', 'put', 'words', 'graphic', 'comedic', 'quotations', 'scenes', 'were', 'neither', 'graphic', 'comedic', 'obviously', 'were', 'trying', 'was', 'never', 'moments', 'viewing', 'where', 'felt', 'level', 'psychological', 'tense', 'drama.3', 'music', 'was', 'often', 'upbeat', 'even', 'scenes', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'dramatic', 'fact', 'music', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'terrible', 'movie.4', 'Plot', 'villans', 'are', 'shown', 'clothes', 'have', 'gotten', 'quite', 'dirty', 'messy', 'car', 'had', 'broken', 'down', 'so', ""'re"", 'stuck', 'woods', 'yet', 'when', 'go', 'Mari', 'Parent', 'home', 'hill', 'somehow', 'managed', 'aquire', 'clean', 'almost', 'business-like', 'clothes', 'hair', 'combed', 'sign', 'dirt', 'anywhere', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'hell', 'magical', 'spring', 'were', 'splashing', 'previous', 'scene.And', 'main', 'female', 'villan', 'would', 'be', 'villaness', 'go', 'sort', 'afro', 'hair', 'style', 'straight', 'hair', 'couple', 'other', 'styles', 'SOMETIMES', 'WITHIN', 'SECONDS', 'BETWEEN', 'SCENES', 'totally', 'missed', 'something', 'was', 'never', 'explained', 'HOW', 'Mari', 'parents', 'knew', 'where', 'find', 'daughter.There', 'are', 'several', 'topless', 'bottomless', 'scenes', 'mostly', 'rape', 'humiliation', 'scenes', 'even', 'THOSE', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'done', 'well.This', 'truly', 'bad', 'film', 'done', 'guys', 'who', 'thankfully', 'got', 'MUCH', 'better', 'genre', 'later']",N/A

It should be easy for any horror fan to spot the influences of THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT in later films such as HALLOWEEN, FRIDAY THE 13th, and Craven's own masterpiece(s), the SCREAM trilogy.In spite of the palpable bargain-basement production values, and regardless of the fact that some of the acting is far from Oscar calibre--to be fair, some of the acting in this film IS excellent, and besides, not all Oscar-winning performances are necessarily Oscar calibre, either--this film is nonetheless quite engaging, often repulsive, and relentlessly frightening.  In fact, sometimes the cheapie quality works to advantage, evoking a gritty realism that makes the film seem more like a documentary than a work of fiction.The new MGM DVD version of this movie is well worth the very reasonable price.  According to Wes Craven in the newly added optional-play intro, this is the first time since its original release that the film has been made available in the original, uncut (or as restored as much as possible) form.  And it comes with lots of cool extras, too, not the least of which are a couple of documentaries featuring interviews with most of the cast, some of the crew, and Wes Craven himself.Be forewarned that THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT is most certainly not every viewer's cup o' tea...not even every horror buff's.  The raw sense of realism, the inexorable graphic violence, and the ambiguous morality of even the film's protagonists create a psychological intensity that can be a bit hard to take.  Viewers who are weak of stomach or weak of mind may do well to heed the advice of the movie's trailer and repeat to themselves, ""It's only a movie...it's only a movie...it's only a movie....""NOTE: THE FOUR-STAR RATING IS FOR FANS OF THE GENRE.

While the quality of the film isn't his best (certainly there are better Craven top quality movies), LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT is more a study of repressed violence in America. David Hess's character is terrifying, nasty, and downright corrupt. I despised his character the most, but he was also very good in the part. The two girls who were ultimately killed in the movie are also good in their roles for the most part, but David Hess just steals the show. The death of the girls are unbelievably violent, especially Phyllis who was stabbed over and over until they virtually were taking out her intestines (just disgusting). David Hess certainly got what was coming to him in the end, but the ending of the film isn't all flowers and candy by any means.While flawed in screen quality and somewhat the story, LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT is a good debut for Craven, and he would show his true flair, especially on A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.

156289,A1E15WYG9C47X1,079284632X,"""mobby_uk""","[4, 8]","As far as directorial debuts are concerned,Wes Craven's Last House on the Left is a great achievement.The film was his first to be credited as a the sole director after sharing this responsibility earlier in '71 with Sean S. Cunnigham for the family movie Together.I waited so long to watch the film, since it was banned for ages in the UK because the British Board of Film Classification-BBFC-had their knives out and were admant not to let this film 'corrupt the morality of society'. Not before the departure of its famous chairman James Ferman, that British audiences got finally the chance to rewatch previously banned films thanks to the long awaited BBFC's  new more liberal policies.So I really wanted to watch Last House on The Left to see what the fuss was all about, and whether the controvery was well justified,( being personally against most censorship in Cinema).Well my first impression was that the film is indeed disturbing.Very. It is a heavy and violent journey into the twisted and sadistic minds of four escaped convicts, torturing and killing two innocent women. The violence and sadism in the film is unrelenting, and very raw, at times psychologically claustrophobic, at others gory and shocking.I never thought I would say this one day, but in some way I could see where the BBFC were coming from. I believe their most area of concern was that this unexplained and extreme sadism, which is both suggestive and graphic was is some way gratitious. Although the message of the film as Craven explains himself in the DVD extras, is anti violence, none of the characters, even the dim witted 'Junior Stillo' show any remorse for their act. The sex crimes which the four psychos brag about,is in reality a very serious crime, and the sexual sadism and pleasure they get from it is very disturbing without any moral or redemptive outlet, the forced peeing in the trousers, the forced lesbianism, the rape, are all images that test the boundaries of human evil and suffering, and will make the viewer squirm in disgust: Craven too admitted in his introduction to the film that Last House on the Left is an ugly movie.My first question was: Why??Do we need to actually SEE these boundaries? Would the real intended message of the film be served by these images?Probably not.There is even some humour in the film, which I found somehow misplaced and in bad taste because it somehow deflects attention from the suffering of the victims,instead of giving the viewer some relief as intended.The quality of the film is similar to many small independant features of the period, and not unlike Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  (Personally I very much prefer Tobe Hooper's film, because of its clever suggestive style).Craven was to build a career for himself as a renowned horror movie director, however the career of most of the actors in the film did not fare as good. The two women victims, Sandra Cassell and Lucy Grantham stopped making films soon after, Fred J Lincoln became a 'porn' director, while Jeramie Rain, the psycho woman of the gang, became Mrs Richard Dreyfuss!!(the one and only Mr D.)So Last House on the Left is not to everybody's taste, and it guarrantees to leave you with a feeling of unease, disgust and horror.You might hate it, or love it but you sure can not ignore it, and this is the power of movie making,to make you think about the film long after you watch it regardless of your opinion of it, and for this alone it is a great achievement from Craven.",3,You can Love or Hate it..But You can not Ignore it!!,1063756800,"09 17, 2003",2003,3487,"['As', 'far', 'directorial', 'debuts', 'are', 'concerned', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'Last', 'House', 'Left', 'great', 'achievement.The', 'film', 'was', 'first', 'be', 'credited', 'sole', 'director', 'sharing', 'responsibility', 'earlier', 'Sean', 'S.', 'Cunnigham', 'family', 'movie', 'Together.I', 'waited', 'so', 'long', 'watch', 'film', 'was', 'banned', 'ages', 'UK', 'British', 'Board', 'Film', 'Classification-BBFC-had', 'knives', 'out', 'were', 'admant', 'not', 'let', 'film', 'morality', 'society', 'Not', 'departure', 'famous', 'chairman', 'James', 'Ferman', 'British', 'audiences', 'got', 'finally', 'chance', 'rewatch', 'previously', 'banned', 'films', 'thanks', 'long', 'awaited', 'BBFC', 'new', 'more', 'liberal', 'policies.So', 'really', 'wanted', 'watch', 'Last', 'House', 'Left', 'see', 'what', 'fuss', 'was', 'controvery', 'was', 'well', 'justified', 'being', 'personally', 'most', 'censorship', 'Cinema', '.Well', 'first', 'impression', 'was', 'film', 'indeed', 'disturbing.Very', 'heavy', 'violent', 'journey', 'twisted', 'sadistic', 'minds', 'four', 'escaped', 'convicts', 'torturing', 'killing', 'two', 'innocent', 'women', 'violence', 'sadism', 'film', 'unrelenting', 'very', 'raw', 'times', 'psychologically', 'claustrophobic', 'others', 'gory', 'shocking.I', 'never', 'thought', 'would', 'say', 'one', 'day', 'way', 'could', 'see', 'where', 'BBFC', 'were', 'coming', 'believe', 'most', 'area', 'concern', 'was', 'unexplained', 'extreme', 'sadism', 'suggestive', 'graphic', 'was', 'way', 'gratitious', 'message', 'film', 'Craven', 'DVD', 'extras', 'anti', 'violence', 'none', 'characters', 'even', 'dim', 'witted', ""'Junior"", 'Stillo', 'show', 'remorse', 'act', 'sex', 'crimes', 'four', 'psychos', 'brag', 'reality', 'very', 'serious', 'crime', 'sexual', 'sadism', 'pleasure', 'get', 'very', 'disturbing', 'moral', 'redemptive', 'outlet', 'forced', 'peeing', 'trousers', 'forced', 'lesbianism', 'rape', 'are', 'images', 'test', 'boundaries', 'human', 'evil', 'suffering', 'will', 'make', 'viewer', 'squirm', 'disgust', 'Craven', 'too', 'admitted', 'introduction', 'film', 'Last', 'House', 'Left', 'ugly', 'movie.My', 'first', 'question', 'was', 'Why', 'Do', 'need', 'actually', 'SEE', 'boundaries', 'Would', 'real', 'intended', 'message', 'film', 'be', 'served', 'images', 'Probably', 'even', 'humour', 'film', 'found', 'somehow', 'misplaced', 'bad', 'taste', 'deflects', 'attention', 'suffering', 'victims', 'instead', 'giving', 'viewer', 'relief', 'intended.The', 'quality', 'film', 'similar', 'many', 'small', 'independant', 'features', 'period', 'not', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'Personally', 'very', 'much', 'prefer', 'Tobe', 'Hooper', 'film', 'clever', 'suggestive', 'style', '.Craven', 'was', 'build', 'career', 'renowned', 'horror', 'movie', 'director', 'however', 'career', 'most', 'actors', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'fare', 'good', 'two', 'women', 'victims', 'Sandra', 'Cassell', 'Lucy', 'Grantham', 'stopped', 'making', 'films', 'soon', 'Fred', 'J', 'Lincoln', 'became', ""'porn"", 'director', 'Jeramie', 'Rain', 'psycho', 'woman', 'gang', 'became', 'Mrs', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'one', 'only', 'Mr', 'D.', 'So', 'Last', 'House', 'Left', 'not', 'everybody', 'taste', 'leave', 'feeling', 'unease', 'disgust', 'horror.You', 'might', 'hate', 'love', 'sure', 'can', 'not', 'ignore', 'power', 'movie', 'making', 'make', 'think', 'film', 'long', 'watch', 'regardless', 'opinion', 'alone', 'great', 'achievement', 'Craven']",N/A

But you know what?It's boring. The rape and torture scenes are no even remotely as ""shocking"" or ""transgressive"" as some reviewers would have you believe... if anything, most of those scenes are alluded to and take place off-screen. ""I Spit on Your Grave"" (""Last House""'s closest relative) is much more graphic and disturbing in its handling of similar scenes. And the revenge violence is fairly uncreative (apart from the oral Bobbit scene -- that was alright!) and didn't feature much gore.In other words, it's not as gory or frightening as many similar horror movies, and it's not as graphic or transgressive as many other exploitation movies. Unfortunately, it features all of the bad acting, ham-handed cinematography, corny soundtrack and overall low production values you'd expect in this kind of movie.IMO this movie gets a LOT of undue praise.

156291,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,079284632X,Monty Moonlight,"[4, 4]","If you're a horror fan and have been for many years, you probably at some point heard of writing/directing legend Wes Craven's debut film ""Last House on the Left"". This low-budget, extremely disturbing (for its time at the very least) 1972 horror film gave rise in various ways to many of the famous horror films that have come since, and it even recently had its own official remake, which I felt handled the overall mood/tone better but was nowhere near as harsh and real. Of course, it's hard and rare to top or even reach the same level of an original film with its remake, but it's especially hard with 70's horror, which always seems so much more real than today's horror films, in which the actors are too recognizable and attractive and the general product too polished. Anyway, this review is about the MGM Collector's Edition DVD release of the original film, though it should be mentioned that the term ""original"" should maybe be taken with a grain of salt, as Craven himself admits to having been greatly inspired by Bergman's ""The Virgin Spring"", which I have yet to see, but it did sound strikingly similar when described.The plot of ""Last House on the Left"" is fairly simple. The day before her 17th birthday party, a sweet, middle-class, girl-next-door type named Mari says goodbye to her parents in their lakeside home and heads out to a rock concert in the city with a female best-friend from the wrong side of the tracks. They decide to try and score some weed before the concert, and they unfortunately run into Junior, the son of just escaped convict Krug, while doing so. Junior lures them into the clutches of Krug and his cohorts, fellow escaped convict ""Weasel"", a sex fiend, and Krug's crazy girlfriend, Sadie. Now, if you don't want spoilers, you may want to skip the rest of this synopsis. However, with this film, it's probably best to know what you're getting into. Basically, the gang takes the pair of young girls out into the woods, where they humiliate, torture, rape and murder them. It's pretty graphic and brutal, probably more in how realistic it is rather than really how much is shown. We are talking top-notch, uninhibited acting here on the part of the villains and their two victims, making for a series of scenes so disturbing in their totally realistic cruelty that this film has become legendary. But, the movie doesn't end with the death of the victims, nor is it about the police catching up with them. In fact, the police are the bumbling comic relief here; to an extreme level. The twist of this film is when the killers take refuge in the home of Mari's parents. Once the parents discover whom their distressed houseguests are, ""Last House on the Left"" goes into revenge film mode, and it is pretty brutal. In my opinion, it tops its recent remake in this regard, and though the film is excellent in its realism and ability to ""get to"" the viewer, the only pleasure I could imagine anyone might gain from viewing this film is in seeing Krug and Company get their comeuppance in the final act.And, that's what makes ""Last House on the Left"" a difficult film to review. It is hard to honestly call it a bad film, though it has flaws, naturally, since we are talking about a low-budget, guerilla style, directorial-debut type film here. It has its excellent aspects. It is overall compelling, disturbing and unforgettable. At the same time, however, it is cruel and miserable. There is no joy to be had here, and really, no fun. There is comic relief spliced in throughout, not to mention an intentionally contradictory and sometimes wacky soundtrack from the film's lead baddie, David Hess (Krug), and both cause some discord among viewers (and even some of the film's actors) on the issue of whether or not they ""work"" within the context of the film (it almost depends on what sort of film you want this to be, but I often lean towards feeling the comic relief doesn't fit at all and the music, well, I go back and forth on the music, though it no doubt demonstrates that Mr. Hess is truly multitalented. Still, as a study of or comment on human nature, violence and society, it is a fascinating work. It invokes many emotions in the viewer, and it probably wouldn't hurt for young women to see this one when taking those steps towards a more independent lifestyle. The horror of ""Last House on the Left"" is that things like this truly do happen, even if they seem too horrible to imagine. There's nothing impossible about what happens to the girls in this film, and in fact, if we're to trust the news media at all, I guess this sort of thing happens every day. It's horrific, and that is why this film is so horrific. Maybe it has little value beyond presenting some of the evils in our society for our own increased awareness, but I suppose that alone makes it worthwhile, and while I find much of this film difficult to watch for just being too tragic, it`s certainly got some great performances worth revisiting too. So, no, I don't hate this one, though it's hard to say I like it. Not sure what to say. I'll just say that ""Last House on the Left"", initially or in certain scenes at least, is a hard watch, but you should probably try to watch it at least once.The collector's edition release from MGM, by the way, has some really nice extras. I would have liked a selection of trailers for the film, but we do get a fantastic audio commentary by the 3 male villain actors, some great retrospective featurettes, deleted scenes and never before seen footage. The featurettes and commentary really do a lot to improve one's appreciation of the film, so be sure to watch those. Also, if you are looking for something... sorta similar, and with the same lead baddie in a similar role, I point my finger to ""House at the Edge of the Park"".",4,A Hard Film to

156294,A3FFMBIY2NO7QN,079284632X,"M. Pizzullo ""Sonuvspam""","[1, 5]","If you haven't seen this, don't be fooled by all the hype. It's just not that shocking. Maybe it was in 72, or is if you still live in the 60's, or maybe I'm just desensitised, but it's shock value is totally overrated. It's noteworthy because it's craven's first, and all the uproar surrounding it, but as a fan of true horror I would feel guilty recommending this to anybody looking for a real shocker or a sleaze fick, this is neither. Despite the hype, craven is still a pretty timid director. People compare House on the edge of the Park to this one, saying that was just a ripoff, blah blah...what happened was craven had a good idea but didn't have the stomach to bring it off properly so Deodata tried to correct the situation. Deodata's flick is definitely sleazier, but hey, it's a sleazy subject. Don't make or watch movies that deal with sleaze if you're not willing to include the actual sleaze. In craven's defense, though, he had to deal with the MPAA, so he probably did go as far as he could given the mindset of the time. A quick comparision of the horror elements and then I'm done.Both flicks use fear of victimization as the chief emotion to play on, and good horror ultimately leaves ""decent"" viewers condoning some inhuman act, thus seeing the villian inside themselves. Both flicks succeed in different ways. Deodata's victimization is more intense and more pervasive, so he definitely succeeds at horrifying the women more than craven does (not that he fails) Deodata, on the other hand, makes the violence and sadism much more arousing, so the decent men come away horrified that it actually turned them on. Craven's victims (the girls) are true victims, since they just get tricked and kidnapped, so that's scarier, but deodata's victims are cruel persons themselves so it becomes a little more difficult to pity them (playing once again on the viewer's inner villian) since they just got beaten at their own game. The turning of the tables, for craven, when the parents go to ridiculous extremes of premeditated vengeance, is theoretically more horrifying because you still condone it, but it comes off as comical in the execution, although the peckerwrecker scene is a gem. In Deodata's comeuppance, the former victims are still fighting for survival so their actions are a little more credible and much more easily condoned (a slightly longer leash for the inner villian). Deodata's victims actually provoked their tormentor(at the party anyway, not the poor girl in the car), which plays to most people's inner resentments at having been victimized (psychologically) themselves by an incrowd at one time or another. Deodata gives viewers (at least the males) more freedom to indentify with victims and victimizers alike, while hating them all at the same time, so he stirs up more conflicting emotions than craven, who obviously takes sides with his treatment of it. The scene where Mari is crying as she submits in the woods was very well done and a little more socially responsible than anything Deodata gave us - all his girls did was scream and for some reason tears are just more disturbing - even though she was naked there was nothing sexy about it, which gave me a chance to feel like a goodguy, weakening the horror for me but perhaps intensifying it for female viewers. Craven's one stab at making viewer sympathize with the villians was extremely well done as art - Having just finished raping Mari, Kruger stood there appearing disgusted with himself as she vomited with an emotional singer whining about feeling like nobody wants him. That was the only show of humanity for kruger in the whole movie and the contrast was really powerful. Even Still, rent this one. House on the edge of the park is worth buying, but if can't stomach this one run screaming from park.

It's a low budget mess with horrible acting and an inappropriate music score that makes this film almost completely un-watch-able! That's not to say that this film doesn't have its moments, it's just too little too late.The film is full of inconsistencies and goes from truly disturbing to ridiculous comedy in the blink of an eye. This is really sad because this film could have been so much better if Wes Craven had kept the tone more even. The rape and killings are pretty brutal for when it was released and it isn't an easy film to watch at times.I also have to compare this film to much better horror films from the same time period such as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre which is far superior and even though it's a low budget film it really works for the most part and the actors seem to be more believable. I realize that this film came out a couple of years before it, but Chainsaw is a much more satisfying horror outing.I give some props for being one of the first films of this nature, but it isn't as good as its reputation.

156299,ATX3O8B1GJ9XU,079284632X,Mr Vess,"[2, 3]","I'm not really going to rate this Craven remake of Bergman as a movie. The full ""Last House on the Left"" would get about 4 stars from me, I suppose. But here I will concentrate on this VHS release only. As for the movie itself, yes, it's far overrated. But, in a way, I was expecting it to be. But I just wanted to see it, since it's one of those ""musts"" on a horror conneisseur's movie list :), even though it has plenty of bad elements - the wooden ""actress"" who plays Phyllis, the unconvincing parents, the dumb bumbling cops (supposed to be comical elements, I presume), and the music (composed by Krug :))), which is B-A-D (the opening theme is okay, and as a whole, the soundtrack might stand on its own, for this kind of music. But the point is that it absolutely does NOT fit the mood, for God's sake! Hence - it's bad *for this movie*, because it doesn't work in it and only takes away from whatever ambience is created). The movie's gritty look and bad sound quality don't really add to the atmosphere too much. But, as I said, it should be on the list of ""horrors to see"". Even with all its shortcomings, ""The Last House on the Left"" is still miles above that pathetic trash horror-wannabe known as ""the Blair Witch""!But that's all beside the point. What I'm rating here is this *release* rather than the movie - hence only two stars. Firstly, it's not widescreen, although as far as I can tell the original was. Secondly, it's CUT! The idiot censors were at work here, obviously. Gone are many scenes, including the famous ""cow intestines"", ""give her a hand"" and ""gotta leave something"" ones (the last one is partially present in a two second flashback), and that's what makes this release unacceptable. Sure, it's cheap, and certainly I wanted to see it so much that I even accepted the inferior quality of NTSC :), and I guess if I knew it was censored, I would've bought it anyway... but still, it's not okay.

The picture, production, presentation, and acting are all pretty primitive, but the film still gets it's point across.  A couple finds themselves slowly transforming into methodical killers to exact revenge upon the men who brutally and pointlessly tortured and killed their daughter, and Craven's unflinching camera isn't afraid to show us the gritty and horrific detail.  The film's biggest flaw is the comic interludes involving the sheriff; these scenes take the dreadful atmosphere away from the film and are nothing more than a distraction from the film's underlying theme.

However exploitation films are certainly not about story or plot and let's face reality here for a moment - you sure as hell are not buying this to see ""Gone with the Wind"" are ya?? Over 30 years later Craven still pretty much delivers on the shock value in aces for a film that was made in 1972!The plot is mostly illogical and is there only to string along a number of nasty and violent set pieces. ...All in all, Last House on the Left is everything that it has claimed to be. Certainly the shock value has not diminished by much - if anything at all, but the story, soundtrack and acting does suffer a little in the 21st century. There is also a meaningless subplot involving two backward officers of the law trying to find the missing girls which serves as nothing more than a time filler and some humour, which to be honest, does very little to make you smile - especially when it follows immediately after a vicious rape sequence. For what its worth the film does pose a moral dilema. Rapists kill for sexual pleasure while mom and dad kill for revenge. Murder is murder whatever way you look at it and certainly the eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth philosophy gets all the workout it needs right here.If you are afraid that Last House on the Left will not live up to its reputation then you are sorely mistaken.

156317,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,079284632X,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[7, 11]","The Last House on the Left (Wes Craven, 1972)When was the last time you saw a movie that was the very definition of the word &quot;pointless?&quot; If you need to shut your brain off for an hour and a half, this is a good way to do it. I'm amazed anyone in Hollywood managed to let Craven direct another film after this ninety-minute waste of celluloid. And yet, somehow (probably because &quot;hey, it's the guy who directed Scream!&quot;), it was re-released with new box art and everything last year. It should have faded into much-deserved obscurity, instead.The plot centers around a girl named Mari Collingwood (Sandra Cassel, one of many people in this flick who never got another role-- hmm, I wonder why) who goes off into the big evil city with her best friend to see a concert. On the way, she and best friend are waylaid by some escaped prisoners, who do very nasty things to them (all artfully shot, of course, to preserve the film's R rating). Well, that's the first half, anyway. The second half hinges on the climax to the first half, and in case you've been living in a cave hundreds of miles from the nearest newsstand that carries Fangoria, I'll leave the second half to your imagination.The main problem with the movie, aside from abysmal acting, a horrible script, amateurish direction, bad lighting, etc., etc., is that the movie loses its direction time and again. In the hands of a better director-- perhaps even if Craven were to remake his own film-- and with a better script (again, Craven could probably do his own rewrite, as he's often shown he's capable of better than this), this could be a tight, punchy thriller with enough extremity about it to still appeal to the shock-flick underground. But what we have here is a film whose sole purpose, it seems, is to say &quot;hey, we have this ratings sytem now, and I'm determined to abuse it in any way I can.&quot; The result is a mess. *",1,Unwatchable at best.,992822400,"06 18, 2001",2001,1918,"['Last', 'House', 'Left', 'Wes', 'Craven', '1972', 'When', 'was', 'last', 'time', 'saw', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'definition', 'word', 'quot', 'quot', 'need', 'shut', 'brain', 'hour', 'half', 'good', 'way', 'do', ""'m"", 'amazed', 'anyone', 'Hollywood', 'managed', 'let', 'Craven', 'direct', 'film', 'ninety-minute', 'waste', 'celluloid', 'yet', 'somehow', 'probably', 'quot', 'hey', 'guy', 'who', 'directed', 'Scream', 'quot', 'was', 're-released', 'new', 'box', 'art', 'everything', 'last', 'year', 'should', 'have', 'faded', 'much-deserved', 'obscurity', 'instead.The', 'plot', 'centers', 'girl', 'named', 'Mari', 'Collingwood', 'Sandra', 'Cassel', 'one', 'many', 'people', 'flick', 'who', 'never', 'got', 'role', 'hmm', 'wonder', 'why', 'who', 'off', 'big', 'evil', 'city', 'best', 'friend', 'see', 'concert', 'way', 'best', 'friend', 'are', 'waylaid', 'escaped', 'prisoners', 'who', 'do', 'very', 'nasty', 'things', 'artfully', 'shot', 'course', 'preserve', 'film', 'R', 'rating', 'Well', 'first', 'half', 'anyway', 'second', 'half', 'hinges', 'climax', 'first', 'half', 'case', ""'ve"", 'been', 'living', 'cave', 'hundreds', 'miles', 'nearest', 'newsstand', 'Fangoria', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'second', 'half', 'imagination.The', 'main', 'problem', 'movie', 'aside', 'abysmal', 'acting', 'horrible', 'script', 'amateurish', 'direction', 'bad', 'lighting', 'etc.', 'etc.', 'movie', 'direction', 'time', 'again', 'hands', 'better', 'director', 'perhaps', 'even', 'Craven', 'were', 'remake', 'own', 'film', 'better', 'script', 'again', 'Craven', 'could', 'probably', 'do', 'own', 'rewrite', 'often', 'shown', 'capable', 'better', 'could', 'be', 'tight', 'punchy', 'thriller', 'enough', 'extremity', 'still', 'appeal', 'shock-flick', 'underground', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'film', 'sole', 'purpose', 'say', 'quot', 'have', 'ratings', 'sytem', 'now', ""'m"", 'determined', 'abuse', 'way', 'can.', 'quot', 'result', 'mess', '*']",N/A

I hate to see a film such as this being trashed by people that don't understand how important something like this is in the film industry. There's something more important here than just the average slasher movie. Think about the time when this movie was made. In 1972, these films were only made from a select group of people. People like John Waters, Tobe Hooper, and all the masters under the thumb of Roger Corman had a mission and a clean canvas of the times. Before them, there was nothing. Now in their wake, all the rest come.I protect this film for the fact of what it was ORGINAL in its time, and a piece of art that has endured through the years.Recently, I received information regarding a reunion, movie and memorabilia expo in Ohio, which reunites some of the original cast of Last House on the Left. For these people alone, this movie launched careers and began something new in the movies that people would never get tired of.Scripted and shot on a low-string budget, Last House on the Left has reached beyond what most of the producers at the time thought possible. Other than ""another drive-in"" movie, this still has watchers in awe of its brilliance. Look beyond the high-cost brain-candy that is spun out today like recycled dryer lint, and see the film for the first time all over again. Whether you squint or just watch straight through without blinking, you'll find some wholesome horror entertainment.For you people out there that read other reviews about how bad the film it, as yourself, does it have to be a masterpiece of Francis Ford Coppola to come out of 1972 to be worth a look? No!

Unflinching in its depiction of torture, rape, and  humiliation it can still make audiences gasp almost thirty years after its  initial release.  This tale of two young girls on their way to a concert  and their misfortunate run in with four dangerous fugitives is essential  viewing for any fan of the Horror genre.  What really disturbed me in this  film is the way the four villains had so much fun in demeaning and then  killing the two girls.  And how very close help was...  Little Craven-esque  quirks tended to pop up (such as a sudden shift from extreme violence to a  scene of almost slapstick humor) that will remind viewers of the Elm Street  and Scream series.

It's a bit informative, definitely shocking, and definitely one that needs to be watched.The movie itself takes a backseat to the content in a couple of its scenes.  It's hard to give an accurate review of this movie while still withholding much of what makes this movie a must see.It's definitely shocking and definitely exploitative to a certian degree, but what really makes this movie is the questions you're left with at the end.  It's an intelligent (if that's even the right choice of wording) 70's exploitation flick.  The exploitation isn't there to arouse, it's there to cringe, disgust, and move to viewers to an uncomfortable feeling.  Most people don't consider this movie to be a masterpiece, or even a good movie.  While no masterpiece, the acting is wooden at times, the direction is a little lagging, and the comedy is forced, this is one of the better movies of the wildly entertaining cinema heaven known as trhe 70's.Last House on the Left packs a whollop that no movies today, notIrreversibleorBaise-Moican ever grasp.  And one thatI Spit On Your Grave (Millennium Edition)can't certainly get.  It's different.  It's thought provoking.  It's shocking and downright terror inducing, but it's viseral yet intellectual, and dangerously effective.  An exploitation with a conscience.Now, the DVD features a commentary with Wes Craven and Sean Cunnigham.

156325,A26WVK274IA7DN,079284632X,Sarah Bellum,"[24, 34]","(2.5/5 stars)  Even though there are some 263 reviews on Amazon as of the writing of this review, I thought I would throw in my own thoughts. Normally I can give my opinion on a movie after I have seen it and explain my reasoning behind it. With ""Last House on the Left,"" I had such an ambivalent feeling afterward it that I am still struggling to come to grips with it, even though I have only watched it once and that was about at least two years ago. In a way, writing this review will help me sort out my own thoughts. If you have watched this film or have read some of the other reviews here, you know it is difficult to watch because of the rape, the gore, humiliation, violence, etc. Usually when I watch a movie, I liked to be entertained; being subjected to the aforementioned acts is not my idea of a good time. I do enjoy horror movies, but I find the scariest horror is that which is unknown. This movie has me re-evaluating and redefining my own definition of ""horror."" What happens to the young ladies in this film is truly horrific and, from what I understand, left one of them in fact emotionally scarred. With so much talk today of torture (at Abu Ghraib, etc.), grisly war crimes, videotaped beheadings, Geneva Convention principles being purposely and expressly ignored, etc, what else is there to shock us? Have we become so inured to violence that our brains can accept and rationalize anything? I have been an admirer of horror films since I was very young for many reasons, such as the supernatural elements of some, the suspense of others or the good vs. evil conflict in still others. Normally what keeps horror movies in check is a sense that the filmmakers also recognize the atrocity being committed and they attempt to validate it; not so with this movie. I genuinely got the feeling the filmmakers relished torturing and mutilating those women, even if it was not real. Apparently they claimed they made this movie to protest the Vietnam War, which was in progress at the time. I could get behind that justification if it were true. For those who didn't need to be shocked in order to find reason to protest the war, why not show how senseless, grim and utterly repulsive killing another human being is? Yet, I am not so certain I accept the argument that this was a war protest. It seemed as though they had too much fun making the movie and invested too much energy making it seem realistic for that argument to seem plausible. Is it fair to judge a movie (for better or worse) based on the intentions of the filmmakers, or based on the quality of person s/he is? I have enjoyed other Wes Craven movies, such as ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" and ""Scream,"" though it seemed difficult to believe the same person was responsible for all these films because those movies adhered to the normal Hollywood conventions. While some will undoubtedly see that as an undesirable trait, for me it adds an element of fun. (See Universal monster movies for further examples)  Ultimately for me, this film was highly effective at being horrific, and succeeding at its goal of horrifying earns this film 5/5 stars. However, a movie should not be an excruciating experience, as this one undoubtedly was for me. For that, it deserves 0/5 stars, for an average of 2.5/5 stars. One final note: many have used the term ""disturbing"" to describe this movie, and I agree. To me, ""disturbing"" and ""enjoyable"" are mutually exclusive. I'm not certain which is more unsettling, this film or the people who said they actually enjoy watching it.",3,My two cents on this film,1155513600,"08 14, 2006",2006,3544,"['2.5/5', 'stars', 'Even', 'are', '263', 'reviews', 'Amazon', 'writing', 'review', 'thought', 'would', 'throw', 'own', 'thoughts', 'Normally', 'can', 'give', 'opinion', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'explain', 'reasoning', 'Last', 'House', 'Left', 'had', 'such', 'ambivalent', 'feeling', 'afterward', 'am', 'still', 'struggling', 'come', 'grips', 'even', 'have', 'only', 'watched', 'once', 'was', 'about', 'least', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'way', 'writing', 'review', 'will', 'help', 'sort', 'out', 'own', 'thoughts', 'have', 'watched', 'film', 'have', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', 'know', 'difficult', 'watch', 'rape', 'gore', 'humiliation', 'violence', 'etc', 'Usually', 'when', 'watch', 'movie', 'liked', 'be', 'entertained', 'being', 'subjected', 'aforementioned', 'acts', 'not', 'idea', 'good', 'time', 'do', 'enjoy', 'horror', 'movies', 'find', 'scariest', 'horror', 'unknown', 'movie', 're-evaluating', 'redefining', 'own', 'definition', 'horror', 'What', 'young', 'ladies', 'film', 'truly', 'horrific', 'what', 'understand', 'left', 'one', 'fact', 'emotionally', 'scarred', 'so', 'much', 'talk', 'today', 'torture', 'Abu', 'Ghraib', 'etc', 'grisly', 'war', 'crimes', 'videotaped', 'beheadings', 'Geneva', 'Convention', 'principles', 'being', 'purposely', 'expressly', 'ignored', 'etc', 'what', 'else', 'there', 'shock', 'Have', 'become', 'so', 'inured', 'violence', 'brains', 'can', 'accept', 'rationalize', 'anything', 'have', 'been', 'admirer', 'horror', 'films', 'was', 'very', 'young', 'many', 'reasons', 'such', 'supernatural', 'elements', 'suspense', 'others', 'good', 'vs.', 'evil', 'conflict', 'still', 'others', 'Normally', 'what', 'horror', 'movies', 'check', 'sense', 'filmmakers', 'also', 'recognize', 'atrocity', 'being', 'committed', 'attempt', 'validate', 'not', 'so', 'movie', 'genuinely', 'got', 'feeling', 'filmmakers', 'relished', 'torturing', 'mutilating', 'women', 'even', 'was', 'not', 'real', 'Apparently', 'claimed', 'made', 'movie', 'protest', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'was', 'progress', 'time', 'could', 'get', 'justification', 'were', 'true', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'shocked', 'order', 'find', 'reason', 'protest', 'war', 'why', 'not', 'show', 'how', 'senseless', 'grim', 'utterly', 'repulsive', 'killing', 'human', 'being', 'Yet', 'am', 'not', 'so', 'certain', 'accept', 'argument', 'was', 'war', 'protest', 'seemed', 'had', 'too', 'much', 'fun', 'making', 'movie', 'invested', 'too', 'much', 'energy', 'making', 'seem', 'realistic', 'argument', 'seem', 'plausible', 'fair', 'judge', 'movie', 'better', 'worse', 'based', 'intentions', 'filmmakers', 'based', 'quality', 'person', 's/he', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'other', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'movies', 'such', 'A', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'Scream', 'seemed', 'difficult', 'believe', 'same', 'person', 'was', 'responsible', 'films', 'movies', 'adhered', 'normal', 'Hollywood', 'conventions', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'see', 'undesirable', 'trait', 'element', 'fun', 'See', 'Universal', 'monster', 'movies', 'further', 'examples', 'Ultimately', 'film', 'was', 'highly', 'effective', 'being', 'horrific', 'succeeding', 'goal', 'horrifying', 'earns', 'film', '5/5', 'stars', 'However', 'movie', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'excruciating', 'experience', 'one', 'undoubtedly', 'was', '0/5', 'stars', 'average', '2.5/5', 'stars', 'One', 'final', 'note', 'many', 'have', 'used', 'term', 'disturbing', 'describe', 'movie', 'agree', 'disturbing', 'enjoyable', 'are', 'mutually', 'exclusive', ""'m"", 'not', 'certain', 'more', 'unsettling', 'film', 'people', 'who', 'said', 'actually', 'enjoy', 'watching']",N/A

After watching this movie I wonder how Craven ever put this movie behind him and gave us Nightmare On Elm Street. The plot is about three escaped cons on the run. A young girl is attacked by them and murdered in the woods next to there house. The killers then go the parents house to stay posing as travelers.The parents discover that there daughter was killed and they know who did it.They then plot there revenge. First is that this is a good premise for a movie, however we have seen this type of revenge movie done much better in movies like Mad Max, Rage, and in the more recent In The Bedroom. Craven's directing would get better so I am a little reluctent to dump to badly on him becouse unlike Lucio Fulchi, Dario Argento, and Ed Wood, He would get better, but that does not make up for this film. The killers are not frightening at all and the script fails halfway though the film. The score (of all things) is amazingly distracting and unneeded. The movie,mabey in the hands of Craven now, or another good director, could be a better film but until then we just have this auful movie....By the way a much better movie about parents coping and revenge was In The Bedroom.

Cunningham, ""The Last House on the Left"" is not for anybody who's even remotely faint of heart.  It takes us to the bowels of human depravity, showing us graphic violence with fake blood that actually looks like real blood.Two teenage girls set out to score some grass before attending a shock-rock act, and are captured, tortured, humiliated, and finally savagely murdered by a ""family"" of twisted creeps, the kind of people you feel filthy just watching.  This group of barbarians end up at the house belonging to the parents of one of the girls, and the parents indulge in a little graphic revenge.In my original IMDB review, I gave it a very negative review because of its depravity and what I perceived as ineptitude on the part of the film-makers.  After seeing it again, I have mellowed towards it somewhat but I must state that THIS ISN'T FOR EVERYBODY.  Don't watch it if you're squeamish to begin with.I also thought originally that the music and songs were dumb; that's not quite true - David A. Hess, who plays the part of the feral and disgusting ""Krug"" Stillo, also did the music and he IS a competent enough composer and musician.  I just thought that it was dumb because upbeat folk/country music is played at what I think are inappropriate times.As for the actual DVD, it DOES get high marks, offering a 29-minute featurette, ""forbidden"" footage (I'm not looking forward to checking out THAT extra!), the obligatory Original Theatrical Trailer, a commentary with Craven and Cunningham, and the chance to view the film with a brief intro by Craven himself.The featurette is pretty informative and it's interesting to see what the actors look like in recent years (the biggest change is in Fred Lincoln, who played the pervert ""Weasel"").If you can stomach the film, I think that you will most likely enjoy this DVD.",4,Thank God it's only a movie!,1094342400,"09 5, 2004",2004,1984,"['disturbing', 'low-low', 'budget', 'mood', 'piece', 'first', 'major', 'film', 'future', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'Friday', '13th', 'directors', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'Sean', 'S.', 'Cunningham', 'Last', 'House', 'Left', 'not', 'anybody', 'who', 'even', 'remotely', 'faint', 'heart', 'bowels', 'human', 'depravity', 'showing', 'graphic', 'violence', 'fake', 'blood', 'actually', 'real', 'blood.Two', 'teenage', 'girls', 'set', 'out', 'score', 'grass', 'attending', 'shock-rock', 'act', 'are', 'captured', 'tortured', 'humiliated', 'finally', 'savagely', 'murdered', 'family', 'twisted', 'creeps', 'kind', 'people', 'feel', 'filthy', 'just', 'watching', 'group', 'barbarians', 'end', 'up', 'house', 'belonging', 'parents', 'one', 'girls', 'parents', 'indulge', 'little', 'graphic', 'revenge.In', 'original', 'IMDB', 'review', 'gave', 'very', 'negative', 'review', 'depravity', 'what', 'perceived', 'ineptitude', 'part', 'film-makers', 'seeing', 'again', 'have', 'mellowed', 'towards', 'somewhat', 'must', 'state', 'THIS', ""N'T"", 'FOR', 'EVERYBODY', 'Do', ""n't"", 'watch', ""'re"", 'squeamish', 'begin', 'with.I', 'also', 'thought', 'originally', 'music', 'songs', 'were', 'dumb', 'not', 'quite', 'true', 'David', 'A.', 'Hess', 'who', 'part', 'feral', 'disgusting', 'Krug', 'Stillo', 'also', 'did', 'music', 'competent', 'enough', 'composer', 'musician', 'just', 'thought', 'was', 'dumb', 'upbeat', 'folk/country', 'music', 'played', 'what', 'think', 'are', 'inappropriate', 'times.As', 'actual', 'DVD', 'DOES', 'get', 'high', 'marks', 'offering', '29-minute', 'featurette', 'forbidden', 'footage', ""'m"", 'not', 'looking', 'forward', 'checking', 'out', 'extra', 'obligatory', 'Original', 'Theatrical', 'Trailer', 'commentary', 'Craven', 'Cunningham', 'chance', 'view', 'film', 'brief', 'intro', 'Craven', 'himself.The', 'featurette', 'pretty', 'informative', 'interesting', 'see', 'what', 'actors', 'look', 'recent', 'years', 'biggest', 'change', 'Fred', 'Lincoln', 'who', 'played', 'pervert', 'Weasel', 'can', 'stomach', 'film', 'think', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'enjoy', 'DVD']",N/A

Conversations where you say things like ""if someone was to ever do that to my daughter, I would [...] their world up"". Well The Last House on the Left basically puts that threat on film in graphic detail.An escaped convict, his brother, son and girlfriend kidnap two young girls, sexually assault them (sigh) and kill one. The criminals then take up refuge in the home of John and Emma Collingwood only to realize that they are the parents of one of the girls. Once their identities are revealed, the mother and father find an assortment of creative ways to butcher and kill the people who hurt their innocent daughter.Without a doubt my favorite character was the mother Emma Collingwood (Monica Potter), fooling us the entire movie by playing the part of the docile wife then switching to Ripley mode when her daughter gets hurt. The dad John Collingwood (Tony Goldwyn) shows you why a doctor could either be an enormous help or a painful threat... Krug (Garret Dillahunt) is an evil rapist sonofabitch who gets whats coming to him and that's putting it nicely. Of all the characters in this dark tale, these three characters really own the show and each actor did a great job in their portrayal.The only gripe I have with this movie is the rape that seemed to go on for 3 hours... I am not a fan of graphic rape scenes and the one portrayed here seemed very real and was torture to sit through... worse to me than even Deliverance, there I said it.  The bad guys outside of Krug seemed to be stand-ins waiting for their turn to be killed since they could be left out of the movie and not be missed. The lead-up to the slaughter was a bit long but from the instance the girls are kidnapped you begin to feel the true terror of their situation. Something with the way it was shot makes you really worry for these girls as they are interrogated by Krug and eventually dragged out to the woods (can't have a rape without woods right?)It seems that with movies like this and Taken, Hollywood wants to scare parents into schooling their kids with some sort of street smarts (always a dumb friend leading an innocent one into some mess). These movies depict men at our lowest of lows, raping and beating teenage women like animals only to have the parent come at them like a bat out of hell.

To me this film is not entertaining, and it is one of only a handful of films that truly disturbed me, one that follows through on it's intent to horrify. Most modern horror films tend to glamorize violence and gore, and tend to herald killers as anti-heroes to a point where the audience is no longer horrified or scared. What I found interesting is where this film sits on the timeline of horror, right after Night of the Living Dead, and right before Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Halloween. It surprises me because it exhibits characteristics that are out of place for the time. The level of gore and outright brutality are much higher than in the films that immediately surround it, and the fact that it predates Texas Chainsaw Massacre by two years astounds me. For me three of the most important aspects of the film are: its ""fairy tale"" plot, it's documentary feel, and it's early use of the ""Rules of Horror"". I believe this is one of the first films that uses punishment as a repercussion of immoral behavior, i.e. ""If you are going to go into a strange apartment in hopes of buying drugs, you will be (insert punishment here). I also believe that this is one of the most exploitative films that came out of the 70's.

It's a million miles away from Craven's Music Of The Heart or Scream, and probably won't appeal to the Craven ""fans"" who like those films.  What you've heard is true:  This is a brutal and relentless film.  It was made in that glorious age of cinema where you could get away with making a film like this.  Sure, it had it censors, but nothing like the strict rules that govern the film industry today. This was the only horror film my mother forbade me to watch as a kid.  Naturally this aroused my interest even more, and I finally got around to it as a teenager.  It's extremely basic:  Two teenage girls are kidnapped by a gang of loons, tortured, beaten, humiliated, raped and killed.  This is the first 50 minutes of the film!  The last act has the parents of one victim getting their bloody revenge, and you'll be cheering them on every second of the way.  The leader of the gang is none other than the creepiest sleazeball in cinematic history, David Hess(no offense, David, I love you).  If you want to make a film with a menacing, evil looking brute who beats women, there is absolutely no one better than David Hess.  He's the kind of actor you might just not want to meet in reality.  Hard to believe this guy wrote two hit singles for Elvis Presley!!!  Like I said, the film is crude, violent, depressing, and has some odd attempts at humor and a bizarre choice of songs for certain scenes(courtesy of, you guessed it, David Hess!).  It's totally uncalled for and there's really no way to defend it.  Just like the commercial: ""Why do you like them?  They don't taste like apples.""  ""We just do.""  If there is any message to be found in this film at all it's this:  It may actually open your eyes-if you live a sheltered life-to the fact that these atrocious, vile things are real.

156339,A1C47YYIL4XVTX,079284632X,"S. Yu ""Sun Tzu""","[8, 13]","My first reaction to this film was to want to puke. I have seen pretty bad horror stuff but this one was filmed in such a deliberately believable/documentary style with a chillingly believable premise. There is something about this film that is just wrong.At the same time, if you read this review carefully you'll hopefully see that this film is more complicated and metaphorical than one would give it credit for. For example, notice that:SADI(e/st) is appropriately named.Some have remarked the soundtrack seems out of place, but the soundtrack matches perfectly with the scenery and with Mari herself; it all represents beauty and innocence, or being carefree. The soundtrack NEVER plays while the girls are in Manhattan; the city represents dirtiness. Later, natural and lyrical beauty is chillingly juxaposed with the most evil violence possible.When the girls are together drinking wine Mari is talking about the onset of winter and her breasts filling out. This is a scene of dark foreboding, though we won't realize it in the first viewing. Winter is the season of death, and Man's fall from grace in the discovery of sexuality (depicted here as Mari's womanhood) is a well known theme from the Biblical the Book of Genesis.The lines ""and the road leads to nowhere"" plays by itself at one point while the girls are driving into the city. The road to nowhere is the road to the city, the city is ""nowhere"" (when the gang's car breaks down one of them sighs, ""Great. We're a million miles from NOWHERE, too""). Alternately, ""nowhere"" symbolizes death (the line is playing again when the parents are running down the road to the lake).When Krug sticks out the revolver for the first time to shoot Mari, there is one arm shot which is an exact imitation of the infamous 1968 photo of a South Vietnamese officer executing a Viet Cong. The gun used is the exact same type of gun. If you think I'm overanalyzing watch the Vietnam video or look at the photo in contrast to the scene; you'll understand.When he shoots Mari, she turns around to look exactly like Ophelia drowning from Hamlet, especially as depicted in Harold Copping's and John Everett Millais's famous paintings. She has long brown hair just like Ophelia's. If you don't believe me Google the paintings, especially Copping's. She's even facing in the same direction.Sadie is the only one to go entirely into the lake to wash herself out after the killings, afterwards she reaches her hand out and says ""Help me out"" because she can't get out of the water. Later she dies in just the same way. This symbolizes the inability to truly escape from the crime.When the criminals are eating at the parents' house, the red wine symbolizes blood while the meatballs and spaghetti symbolize blood and flesh. It shows them cutting and drinking heavily.When the mother asks Phyllis what her parents do, she says they are in ""the Iron and Steel business,"" the mother replies sarcastically ""Iron and Steel together, how unusual"" and she explains it stupidly as ""My mother irons and my father STEALS.""Later when the father asks the criminals later what sort of business they are in, one says ""plumbing"" and the other says ""insurance"" and Sadie explains it that they sell insurance to the plumbing companies, adding stupidly, ""You know, in case they STEAL some toilets or something.""This parallel is significant because both Phyllis and the criminals later represent ""Trojan horses"", harmful people from the inner city intruding on the pure rural home in the guise of respectability.At the beginning of the movie Mari is debating the band ""Bloodlust"" with her parents, her father asks ""Don't you feel sorry for the chickens?"" and Mari replies sarcastically, ""I couldn't tell you the nights I cried myself to sleep over that CHICKEN (emphasis Mari's)""Later, in the scene immediately after Mari's death, the police officers cannot get a ride on the black woman's truck because she's got ""11 crates of chickens.""The semi-toothed black woman's plot role is as a target of impatience/resentment here. It is just after the worst killing and the viewer is emotionally most upset, the last thing we want to see is someone laughing at the incompetence of the police. We desperately want people to respect and help the police so they can do their job and bring these bastards to justice. There's a similiar scene just before the killings where some hippies scream ""We hate cops!"" and give them the finger instead of giving them a lift. But it's the viewer who hates the hippies and their attitude. After all there is a girl being raped!Most controversially perhaps I will claim that there is a definite hard-right political edge running through this film. Besides the overarching vigilante theme (which is consistent with the backlash against crime more openly portrayed in films such as Dirty Harry (1971) or Death Wish (1973)), targets of impatience/resentment or symbols of foolishness include hippies, the city, a black woman, a drug addict, and most of all the rebellious daughters themselves. The police are also objects of derirsion but it's because they don't take crime seriously enough, they aren't hard enough on crime. Phyllis is punished for her rebelliousness wanting to buy marijuana and biting Krug when he opens the trunk (otherwise the cops would have found them), and Mari is punished for being with Phyllis and defending her against her parents' wishes. But Mari's death is more dignified in that she is spared the disemboweling. By saying the Lord's prayer she has cleansed herself of the rebelliousness displayed in the opening act.But the only unblemished dignity for most of the film is found in the conservative parents, representing traditional family values. In the end they are driven to craziness by the craziness around them... Much as American society is driven to the craziness of making films such as LOHTL as a response to the spiraling crime of the 1970's (The theme of vigilantism and the descent into insanity shows up in other works of this period, such as the much more appreciated Taxi Driver (1976)). Society was breaking down in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Everything previously taken for granted was being ripped into a million pieces. It's impossible for this movie not to reflect that, and perhaps not to be a part of the violent backlash. Later this quintessential model would be made more acceptable and repackaged, sparking off the 1980's horror genre, a kind of mass social therapy provided by Hollywood.",3,"Surprise!

I was able to rent the movie tonight and rewatch it for the 1st time in 30 something years.  So as you can imagine it is extremly dated, and it shows it's age.  It is NOT a feel good movie, so if you are expecting 90 mins of fun and excitement, forget it.  There are no special effects and the budget is obviously very small.  However I felt that the directing was excellent and this is a very powerful movie and not for the squemish.  The bumbling cops in the movie provided some very needed comic releif to offset the extremly disturbing subject matter.  Let's face it the kidnapping, rape, mutilation and murder of two young teenage girls is bad enough.  It is hard to watch at times, expecially due to the fact that the murders take place in such close proximtity to the girls home, where the gang of rapists and murderes end up after they commit their horrific crimes.  Again this movie is not entertaining in the least, but, I gave it four stars because it does succeed in it's intended purpose. It's shocking and horrific and a parents worst nightmare come true.  You may find yourself cheering on the parents of Mary when they discover the truth and plot their revenge.  Maybe that was the purpose of the film to feel that bit of satisfaction when the villians get what is comeing to them.

More than a few times this movie was mentioned, and I think it was like #3 or something. I saw it at the movie store and decided to rent it just to see what all the hub-bub was all about.WHAT A BAD MOVIE! First off, it's not even scary. Poor production, poor acting, and a very POOR story! Sure it might have been ""groundbreaking"" in 1972, but come on, it's a pile of poop now. The first car was pretty cool in it's day also, but there's no comparison to a modern day sports car. This movie is BAD, it's boring. Did I mention it's bad? You want a scary movie, see ALIENS. I can't believe people ever thought this was scary. I can't believe it was actually banned. What a joke. People say, oh, it's a cult classic, and oh, it was good for it's day. Yeah, a lot of things we thought were great in the past, we look back now and realize they were poop. This movie is poop.

Dire acting, lousy direction - just because a film has bucket loads of fake blood does NOT make it frightening.One of the more notorious of the banned series would be Wes Craven't Last House On The Left, a charmless movie showing what happens when normal people are pushed to the extremities of survival (like Hills Have Eyes, but nowhere near as good).The problem with Last House On The Left isn't it's plot, which is pretty good (teenage girls go to a party, get kidnapped by rapists, get abused and then the parents get revenge), but the whole package is just so shoddy. The dialogue is awful, with poorly delivered lines that don't convince for one second (compare to the natural flow of dialogue in, say, Texas Chainsaw Massacre) and the acting is abysmal. And let's not even get started on the totally misplaced ""comedy cops"", along with funny music to really get the ribs tickled. Yup, after watching teenage girls get raped there's nothing funnier than stoner cops. Hee-haw.Wes Craven would, of course, go onto far better things (Hills, Nightmare On Elm Street) but this seems to have got some kind of reputation as a long lost classic. It really isn't - it doesn't convince for a second, it's not scary and it's just another in the long line of turgid exploitation flicks.  If you DO buy this movie though (those of you foolish enough to ignore The Curmudgeon's advice) you won't, like the tag-line says, be repeating to yourself ""it's just a movie, it's just a movie"", it'll be more along the lines of ""I can sell this on ebay, I can sell this on ebay.""

I found this movie at Bloackbuster in the horror section so I decided to give it a try. Here goes:Ok. The first character in this movie is an old man delivering the mail. Please tell me this isn't the main character. This is going to be the most boring review ever!! Okay old man is gone and is replaced with.... a hot chick in the shower!!! Alright. The girl and parent's are now talking. Who is the main character in this movie anyway!!!???Shi*. I think it's the hot girl who was in the shower. But that means...I have to be a girl in this review!!! But the Patriarch(yours truly) is a dude! Well here goes. I, Mary Collinwood,am still arguing with my parents.It looks like I'm going to a concert tonight. Alright. Now I'm hanging out with another hot girl in the woods. Now I'm beginning to like being in this movie. We could be lesbians and in that case i'll get to make out with the other girl. Now there is a happy folk song playing, maybe this was misplaced in the horror section after all.Okay the other chick and I are riding in the car, she's driving. What's this? Some mentally ill convicts have escaped and are in the area where the concert we're going to! This is scary, maybe we shouldn't go after all.The convicts are now talking in their apartment, but I'm not there so I don't know this.Alright back to me. We're getting ice cream. I just shouted out ""nuts!"" Now we're looking to score some dope. How about this creepy looking guy standing outside his apartment for no reason. He says he's got some good stuff. Let's go in and get it!Well there are convicts and they are just chillin. Oh shi*. They just slammed the door behind us. Meanwhile, my parents are decorating for my birthday party, but unless I can do astral projection, I have no way of knowing this!! Well, the convicts are tormenting us. One of them just pulled a knife out and is mooing at my friend. I hope this is just a movie after all. My friend is getting the brunt of the torment and now the guy is unbuttoned her shirt. One of the convicts is a girl and she likes my friend too. She's got her arms around her. Oh crap the guy just slugged my friend in the stomach and is raping her. This is horrible what am I gonna do?Well, it looks like I've been knocked out. I'm coming too and crap, I'm in a trunk. Why would someone write me into this movie. Ok trunk opens. My friend bites the crap out of a convicts hand. Smart move. Make the psychos angry.They're dragging us into the woods now. This movie doesn't have a happy ending does it? They want to torment us some more. Why I didn't do anything to them! They tell my friend to pee in her pants. What is wrong with these people. She hesitates so one of the creeps cuts me. She give in and pees her pants. Are they going to make me pee my pants? Nope. They just want the other girl to punch me. Thanks a lot guys. Well, she slugs me in the stomach and apologizes. Thanks friend. Now the little creep wants us to make it with each other. Finally things get good. I wanted this is happen from the beginning. I pretend not to like it though.Now that the fun's over we try to escape. We take separate paths though. Well it looks like they caught up with me. I ask if my friend got away and they show me her arm which they chopped off. Looks like my friend didn't have a happy ending. But I'm the protagonist, nothing can happen to me, mwa ha ha! Or can it, the dude's carving his name into my chest. Ouch. Alright he's raping me now that my friend is dead. I may make it out of this alive, but I am going to be in therapy for the rest of my life. Whenit's over I toss my cookies and take a dip in a pond because I feel dirty. And what the hell, dude just shot me! And then he shoots me again. I'm dead. What the hell!!! The movies only halfway over, how can I be dead, I'm the fricking main character.

Well, after watching it first time, about a year ago, I must say I was disappointed overall. I felt the film just didn't live up to its hype, and I remember the acting as being downright horrible! Well, I have just recently re-watched this film, and I can say that I the second time around, the film wasn't a bad as I previously thought, however, I'm not saying I'm in love with it now, either. As far as the positives go, I think the story and plot to this film is pretty well written. The special effects, I think were great, considering the budget and the time it was made. And because of the low budget and the cheap way the movie was filmed, it does have a ""real"" feel to it and helps add effectiveness. Yes, there is a torture/rape scene that has become infamous over the years. And for its time, I can understand the uproar it got. However, in my opinion, I don't think it was all that disturbing or violent, and probably seems a bit tame by today's standards. Now for the negatives, first off being the music!!! Good God, what was Wes thinking here? (yes, we have the main bad guy, Krug (David Hess) to thank for the music here!)There are horrible musical interludes weaved throughout the film ad well as in the background of the most intense scenes! Maybe Craven thought he was being clever by having violent/climatic scenes mixed with happy/trippy background music, but to me, it hurts the film horribly, and takes away from being suspenseful at all. Another negative was the acting. Though the performances were better than I previously thought, they still aren't good, except for that of David Hess (Krug), which I think did an excellent job, and in many ways, saved the movie. However, the roles of the sheriff and the deputy were pretty bad. In fact, it reminded of something out of Smokey and the Bandit when watching them trying to hitch a ride!!! I also felt that the ending was a bit unrealistic in a sense the the parents seemed way too calm about the whole situation, and instead of just going into the killers room and shooting/beating/stabbing them to death, they calmly and carefully planned out a means of revenge. I really don't buy that, but whatever, its a movie, right? Anyway, this DVD contains audio commentary from Craven and Cunningham, a featurette about the film, Outtakes and Dailies, Forbidden Footage, and a little introduction by Craven himself before the film. There are rumors that this film might be remade, and though I'm not a big fan of remakes, I think that in right hands, this film could be made into something real good. The story is already there, just throw in some better acting, better dialog here and there, and definitely a better musical score, and you could have something new and fresh for today's time. Now it may seem that I'm bashing this film a bit too much, but I do feel that it has its rightful place in the horror/suspense genre, and its a must have for any horror fanatic.",3,"A Cult Classic Horror/Suspense Film, but with some flaws...",1190851200,"09 27, 2007",2007,3518,"['remember', 'when', 'first', 'heard', 'film', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'finding', 'out', 'controversy', 'caused', 'back', 'day', 'was', 'very', 'eager', 'watch', 'not', 'just', 'reason', 'was', 'first', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'film', 'future', 'horror', 'directors', 'Sean', 'S.', 'Cunningham', 'first', 'Friday', '13th', 'Steve', 'Miner', 'Friday', '13th', '2', '3', 'as', 'well', 'Halloween', 'H20', 'horror', 'dream', 'team', 'would', 'expect', 'be', 'horror', 'masterpiece', 'remember', 'was', 'guys', 'ever', 'made', 'name', 'horror', 'business', 'Well', 'watching', 'first', 'time', 'year', 'ago', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'disappointed', 'overall', 'felt', 'film', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'hype', 'remember', 'acting', 'being', 'downright', 'horrible', 'Well', 'have', 'just', 'recently', 're-watched', 'film', 'can', 'say', 'second', 'time', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'previously', 'thought', 'however', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', ""'m"", 'love', 'now', 'either', 'As', 'far', 'positives', 'go', 'think', 'story', 'plot', 'film', 'pretty', 'well', 'written', 'special', 'effects', 'think', 'were', 'great', 'considering', 'budget', 'time', 'was', 'made', 'low', 'budget', 'cheap', 'way', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'have', 'real', 'feel', 'add', 'effectiveness', 'Yes', 'torture/rape', 'scene', 'become', 'infamous', 'years', 'time', 'can', 'understand', 'uproar', 'got', 'However', 'opinion', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'disturbing', 'violent', 'probably', 'bit', 'tame', 'today', 'standards', 'Now', 'negatives', 'first', 'being', 'music', 'Good', 'God', 'what', 'was', 'Wes', 'thinking', 'here', 'yes', 'have', 'main', 'bad', 'guy', 'Krug', 'David', 'Hess', 'thank', 'music', 'here', 'are', 'horrible', 'musical', 'interludes', 'weaved', 'film', 'ad', 'well', 'background', 'most', 'intense', 'scenes', 'Maybe', 'Craven', 'thought', 'was', 'being', 'clever', 'having', 'violent/climatic', 'scenes', 'mixed', 'happy/trippy', 'background', 'music', 'film', 'horribly', 'away', 'being', 'suspenseful', 'negative', 'was', 'acting', 'performances', 'were', 'better', 'previously', 'thought', 'still', 'are', ""n't"", 'good', 'David', 'Hess', 'Krug', 'think', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'many', 'ways', 'saved', 'movie', 'However', 'roles', 'sheriff', 'deputy', 'were', 'pretty', 'bad', 'fact', 'reminded', 'something', 'Smokey', 'Bandit', 'when', 'watching', 'trying', 'hitch', 'ride', 'also', 'felt', 'ending', 'was', 'bit', 'unrealistic', 'sense', 'parents', 'seemed', 'way', 'too', 'calm', 'whole', 'situation', 'instead', 'just', 'going', 'killers', 'room', 'shooting/beating/stabbing', 'death', 'calmly', 'carefully', 'planned', 'out', 'means', 'revenge', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'whatever', 'movie', 'right', 'Anyway', 'DVD', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Craven', 'Cunningham', 'featurette', 'film', 'Outtakes', 'Dailies', 'Forbidden', 'Footage', 'little', 'introduction', 'Craven', 'film', 'are', 'rumors', 'film', 'might', 'be', 'remade', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'remakes', 'think', 'right', 'hands', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'something', 'real', 'good', 'story', 'already', 'there', 'just', 'throw', 'better', 'acting', 'better', 'dialog', 'here', 'there', 'definitely', 'better', 'musical', 'score', 'could', 'have', 'something', 'new', 'fresh', 'today', 'time', 'Now', 'may', 'seem', ""'m"", 'bashing', 'film', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'do', 'feel', 'rightful', 'place', 'horror/suspense', 'genre', 'must', 'have', 'horror', 'fanatic']",N/A

I was hardly impressed upon first viewing it and simply dismissed it as a piece of garbage.The story centers around the kidnapping, rape, torture and murder of two young girls by a group of sadistic sociopaths and the subsequent revenge by one of the girl's parents. The film is obviously very ""low budget"" and the acting is really quite atrocious at times. In a scene in which one of the girls looks on as her friend is beaten and raped in the apartment of the killers, her reaction to what she is seeing looks as if she's simply having trouble deciding on what outfit she should wear!! The film has a documentary-like feel to it and it is primarily this aspect of the film which creates such a brutal realism and makes these violent scenes uncomfortable to watch. The humiliation the girls are forced to endure is horrifying because it feels so real.What surprised me was how this movie stayed with me for days afterwards. It was so disturbing that I couldn't get it out of my head. I noticed that the DVD version had an ""unedited"" cut of the film along with commentary by Wes Craven and Sean Cunningham, the makers of the film. Upon a second viewing of the movie, I gained a somewhat sheepish respect for the film. The goal of a movie is to make an impact on it's audience, good or bad, and that's exactly what this film does. This is not a ""feel good"" movie and it's not one that I would even recommend to friends and say ""You have to see this movie!"" It's fascinating in the same way that car accidents are fascinating. The viewer is horrified at what they're looking at but unable to stop looking. No other movie I have seen has ever captured the level of realism that this one does. You can actually see this happening in real life, just as it plays out on the screen and it is a devastatingly depressing thought. (There is a foreword at the beginning of the film that claims this was based on a true story, but Wes Craven admits in the commentary track that it, in fact, is not true at all.) The last third of the film, which deals with the parent's revenge is no less violent or disturbing.There are some lighter comedic scenes (however lame they may be) involving two police officers which does provide a break in the tension created by the film.The DVD ""unedited"" version differs from the VHS version in only a couple of the scenes in which a few seconds of the more graphic violence was trimmed out of the VHS version. The commentary track is interesting to listen to primarily because Wes and Sean make fun of their own movie throughout the entire commentary, cracking jokes and laughing at the movie the entire time.

It could have been so much better if the atmosphere and music had been arranged more effectively. The music used is so bad that it's hard to imagine what the director was thinking - it's supposed to be a horror story, not a love story. Possibly, the use of nightime in some scenes would have created a more scary atmosphere. Nearly all scenes are daylight . Aside from that, the acting from the girls does not present any fear from their side. It gets worse though, the parent's acting doesn't show them as grief stricken,and the actor who played the mother was totally miscast. A very amateurish effect overall. While it remains banned in some countries (and may be the reason why it is considered a cult-classic), it was made way back when censorship laws were very tough. I had always wanted to see this, because it was a Wes Craven movie - but be warned, it's not at all as scary as they promise on the back cover.  Wes Craven really hasn't made a decent movie when you think about it.  Just rent this one  if you have to see it. Definitely not worthy of cult-classic status.

The ad claimed to be so scary that to avoid fainting you had to keep repeating it's only a movie, it's only a movie. After it was over, we all felt cheated because the movie was not  scary and did not make  sense. Apparently, we saw an edited version back in '72. The new DVD has the restored version and lived up to it's orginal advertisement. I'm a fan of horror movies and not easily shocked but I had a hard time watching ""Last House on the Left"". The first part of the movie concerns the kidnapping, humiliation, tortue and brutal death of two teenage girls. The second part concerns the revenge exacted on the thugs who killed the girls. The brutality seems so real that it's difficult (for even jaded me) to be entertained. I'm giving it two stars because I can recognize it is well made but it's extremely difficult to watch; and being a gore hound/horror movie buff, that's saying alot.",2,It's ONLY a Movie,1062288000,"08 31, 2003",2003,984,"['Back', '1972', 'advertisment', 'movie', 'created', 'long', 'line', 'local', 'drive', 'ad', 'claimed', 'be', 'so', 'scary', 'avoid', 'fainting', 'had', 'keep', 'repeating', 'only', 'movie', 'only', 'movie', 'was', 'over', 'felt', 'cheated', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'scary', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'Apparently', 'saw', 'edited', 'version', 'back', ""'72"", 'new', 'DVD', 'restored', 'version', 'lived', 'up', 'orginal', 'advertisement', ""'m"", 'fan', 'horror', 'movies', 'not', 'easily', 'shocked', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'watching', 'Last', 'House', 'Left', 'first', 'part', 'movie', 'kidnapping', 'humiliation', 'tortue', 'brutal', 'death', 'two', 'teenage', 'girls', 'second', 'part', 'revenge', 'exacted', 'thugs', 'who', 'killed', 'girls', 'brutality', 'so', 'real', 'difficult', 'even', 'jaded', 'be', 'entertained', ""'m"", 'giving', 'two', 'stars', 'can', 'recognize', 'well', 'made', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'watch', 'being', 'gore', 'hound/horror', 'movie', 'buff', 'saying', 'alot']",N/A
156360,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,079284632X,Wuchak,"[3, 8]","I've heard quite a bit about Wes Craven's 1972 debut film ""Last House on the Left"" over the years and finally decided to see what the hoopla was all about.PLOT (Spoilers!): ""Last House"" is a simple rape/murder/revenge horror flick about two Connecticut girls who go to the big city to catch a rock concert, but they look for pot in the wrong place and end up kidnapped, humiliated, tortured, raped and killed. When the father & mother of one of the victims find out they set out to take revenge; the culprits aren't hard to find 'cause they're, coincidently, overnight guests in their house!This is, apparently, a loose remake of Ingmar Bergman's ""Virgin Spring"" (1960), albeit in a modern America setting.WHAT WORKS: Aside from the brief Manhattan scenes, the woodsy Connecticut locations are great (Westport & Redding); the three female actors are cute; and the diversified score (by the actor playing Krug) is entertaining even while a lot of it is incongruous with the material. In addition, the film can be appreciated as an early 70s period piece/oddity or if you're a Craven fan.Also, if you're a gorehound there's some significant gore, in particular a bloody disembowlment sequence.WHAT DOESN'T WORK: Wow, this story is really DUMB. I'm not referring to just the goofy aspects, i.e. the two rural policemen, but to the complete implausibility of the storyline: [SPOILER ALERT!] The criminal gang just so happens to break down right in front of the rural house of one of the victims? Why sure! But there's more, way more: After breaking down on some desolate country road the gang decides to take a frolic in the woods where they torment, rape & murder the girls; their clothes are completely bloody but they're able to fully wash up in a scummy pond and deck themselves to the hilt. Where'd they get the soap and towels, etc.? (I didn't see any) Where'd they get the nice dress clothes? Didn't they just escape from prison? Then they knock on the door of the closest house, the house of one of the victims (which they don't realize yet), and her parents cluelessly allow this suspicious foursome to stay overnight, a couple of 'em in their daughters very room -- unbelievable! Keep in mind that their daughter has been missing since the night before and they should be seriously concerned about that, but they're okay enough to allow four weirdo adult strangers to occupy their home -- Why sure! The revenge of the parents is just as ridiculous. [END SPOILER]. As noted above, many of these scenes are combined with an unfitting goofy score, which makes them all the more absurd. Really, the story is so ridiculous it's as if a 13 year-old came up with the plot but, no, it was written/directed by  Wes Craven, a full-fledged adult with degrees in writing & psychology -- unbelievable.With this understanding, how can the viewer possibly take the story serious? Which is why I find it strange that some people call this ""the most disturbing film ever made,"" etc. If the material is absurd it can't truly be disturbing because it can't be taken seriously. Is the violence in the Road Runner disturbing? No. Why? Because it's a cartoon and it's preposterous. ""Last House"" may not be a cartoon but it's the same principle because it's just as preposterous.The reason 1978's ""I Spit On Your Grave"" works, for what it is, is because it's presented to the viewer in a serious, realistic manner (well, except for parts of the revenge scenes in the last 20 minutes -- but even those sequences are believable compared to the inanities of ""Last House""). Consequently, ""I Spit On Your Grave"" is disturbing, ""Last House"" is not.One may defend the film on the grounds that it was the first of its kind as far as gore goes. I don't think so. ""Night of the Living Dead"" came out four years earlier and has more gore, albeit in black & white. ""Night"" is a thousand times more disturbing and horrifying because, again, it takes the material serious.Some may object to how sick & sadistic the criminal scumbags are, but they're supposed to be appalling because this is a rape/murder/revenge horror flick. It comes with the territory.BOTTOM LINE: I generously give ""Last House"" 2/5 Stars for the positive elements noted above but, really, this is one of the dumbest flicks I've ever seen. I find it hard to believe it ever got a green light. You gotta see it to believe it, meaning it's definitely worthwhile as an early 70s curiosity.The film runs 84 minutes and the original cut 91 minutes.",2,Dumb,1254009600,"09 27, 2009",2009,4482,"[""'ve"", 'heard', 'quite', 'bit', 'Wes', 'Craven', '1972', 'debut', 'film', 'Last', 'House', 'Left', 'years', 'finally', 'decided', 'see', 'what', 'hoopla', 'was', 'about.PLOT', 'Spoilers', 'Last', 'House', 'simple', 'rape/murder/revenge', 'horror', 'flick', 'two', 'Connecticut', 'girls', 'who', 'go', 'big', 'city', 'catch', 'rock', 'concert', 'look', 'pot', 'wrong', 'place', 'end', 'up', 'kidnapped', 'humiliated', 'tortured', 'raped', 'killed', 'When', 'father', 'mother', 'one', 'victims', 'find', 'set', 'out', 'take', 'revenge', 'culprits', 'are', ""n't"", 'hard', 'find', ""'re"", 'coincidently', 'overnight', 'guests', 'house', 'apparently', 'loose', 'remake', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'Virgin', 'Spring', '1960', 'albeit', 'modern', 'America', 'setting.WHAT', 'Aside', 'brief', 'Manhattan', 'scenes', 'woodsy', 'Connecticut', 'locations', 'are', 'great', 'Westport', 'Redding', 'three', 'female', 'actors', 'are', 'cute', 'diversified', 'score', 'actor', 'playing', 'Krug', 'entertaining', 'even', 'lot', 'incongruous', 'material', 'addition', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'appreciated', 'early', '70s', 'period', 'piece/oddity', ""'re"", 'Craven', 'fan.Also', ""'re"", 'gorehound', 'significant', 'gore', 'particular', 'bloody', 'disembowlment', 'sequence.WHAT', 'DOES', ""N'T"", 'WORK', 'Wow', 'story', 'really', 'DUMB', ""'m"", 'not', 'referring', 'just', 'goofy', 'aspects', 'i.e', 'two', 'rural', 'policemen', 'complete', 'implausibility', 'storyline', '[', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'criminal', 'gang', 'just', 'so', 'break', 'down', 'right', 'front', 'rural', 'house', 'one', 'victims', 'Why', 'sure', 'more', 'way', 'more', 'breaking', 'down', 'desolate', 'country', 'road', 'gang', 'take', 'frolic', 'woods', 'where', 'torment', 'rape', 'murder', 'girls', 'clothes', 'are', 'completely', 'bloody', ""'re"", 'able', 'fully', 'wash', 'up', 'scummy', 'pond', 'deck', 'hilt', 'Where', ""'d"", 'get', 'soap', 'towels', 'etc.', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'Where', ""'d"", 'get', 'nice', 'dress', 'clothes', 'Did', ""n't"", 'just', 'escape', 'prison', 'Then', 'knock', 'door', 'closest', 'house', 'house', 'one', 'victims', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'yet', 'parents', 'cluelessly', 'suspicious', 'foursome', 'stay', 'overnight', 'couple', ""'em"", 'daughters', 'very', 'room', 'unbelievable', 'Keep', 'mind', 'daughter', 'been', 'missing', 'night', 'should', 'be', 'seriously', 'concerned', ""'re"", 'okay', 'enough', 'allow', 'four', 'weirdo', 'adult', 'strangers', 'occupy', 'home', 'Why', 'sure', 'revenge', 'parents', 'just', 'as', 'ridiculous', '[', 'END', 'SPOILER', ']', 'noted', 'many', 'scenes', 'are', 'combined', 'unfitting', 'goofy', 'score', 'more', 'absurd', 'Really', 'story', 'so', 'ridiculous', '13', 'year-old', 'came', 'up', 'plot', 'was', 'written/directed', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'full-fledged', 'adult', 'degrees', 'writing', 'psychology', 'unbelievable.With', 'understanding', 'how', 'can', 'viewer', 'possibly', 'take', 'story', 'serious', 'Which', 'why', 'find', 'people', 'call', 'most', 'disturbing', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'etc', 'material', 'absurd', 'ca', ""n't"", 'truly', 'be', 'disturbing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'violence', 'Road', 'Runner', 'disturbing', 'No', 'Why', 'cartoon', 'preposterous', 'Last', 'House', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'cartoon', 'same', 'principle', 'just', 'preposterous.The', 'reason', '1978', 'Spit', 'Your', 'Grave', 'what', 'presented', 'viewer', 'serious', 'realistic', 'manner', 'well', 'parts', 'revenge', 'scenes', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'even', 'sequences', 'are', 'believable', 'compared', 'inanities', 'Last', 'House', 'Consequently', 'Spit', 'Your', 'Grave', 'disturbing', 'Last', 'House', 'not.One', 'may', 'defend', 'film', 'grounds', 'was', 'first', 'kind', 'as', 'far', 'gore', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'came', 'out', 'four', 'years', 'earlier', 'more', 'gore', 'albeit', 'black', 'white', 'Night', 'thousand', 'times', 'more', 'disturbing', 'horrifying', 'because', 'again', 'material', 'serious.Some', 'may', 'object', 'how', 'sick', 'sadistic', 'criminal', 'scumbags', 'are', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'be', 'appalling', 'rape/murder/revenge', 'horror', 'flick', 'territory.BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'generously', 'give', 'Last', 'House', '2/5', 'Stars', 'positive', 'elements', 'noted', 'really', 'one', 'dumbest', 'flicks', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'ever', 'got', 'green', 'light', 'got', 'ta', 'see', 'believe', 'meaning', 'definitely', 'worthwhile', 'early', '70s', 'curiosity.The', 'film', '84', 'minutes', 'original', 'cut', '91', 'minutes']",N/A

156362,A25JBPU5G0C29H,079284632X,Zev Bazarov,"[1, 4]","Its no surprise this film (and a slew of others) were made at the beginning of the 70s. It was a dangerous time, where serial killing was happening more and more. This film can be seen as a commentary and warning for the time: murder is real, and can happen to anyone. And that is what this film is about, two teenage girls are killed by escaped prisoners. But in a twist in the horror genre, the family members end up getting their revenge with their own hands.This is Wes Craven's first major film, and was tremendously influential to the horror, particularly the slasher genre. Horror films constantly steel from this film. As they do with Cravens other two wildly influential films Nightmare on Elm Street, and Scream. Craven shows how well he is at directing horror, all shots are picked to created the most dread and suspense. Foreshadowing is used a lot, and the film has a very stark realistic tone. The only problems are: this is a touchy subject and the film is so realistic I can understand how easily upset someone might get. Another problem is the soundtrack is not all that good, and not suspenseful at all, its basically light 70s rock. The performances are done well as the killers seem like ruthless sociopaths, but the two teenage girls dont show much terror as would be expected. Maybe they are just too shocked. The very first scene is kinda silly, but the rest is good, especially the final part. The middle of the film is mostly a realistic depiction of what its like to be murdered.Overall this is a very well made horror film, and all horror fans should definitely see this, as this is a major film in the history of horror. As for most other people, there are films in other genres that are not so graphic that are revenge flicks you could enjoy, if you find realistic graphic scenes of killing and rape too much for you. 5 stars, check out, if you dare.",5,Well made influential horror film.,1033862400,"10 6, 2002",2002,1879,"['surprise', 'film', 'slew', 'others', 'were', 'made', 'beginning', '70s', 'was', 'dangerous', 'time', 'where', 'serial', 'killing', 'was', 'happening', 'more', 'more', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'commentary', 'warning', 'time', 'murder', 'real', 'can', 'happen', 'anyone', 'what', 'film', 'about', 'two', 'teenage', 'girls', 'are', 'killed', 'escaped', 'prisoners', 'twist', 'horror', 'genre', 'family', 'members', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'revenge', 'own', 'hands.This', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'first', 'major', 'film', 'was', 'tremendously', 'influential', 'horror', 'particularly', 'slasher', 'genre', 'Horror', 'constantly', 'steel', 'film', 'do', 'Cravens', 'other', 'two', 'wildly', 'influential', 'films', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'Scream', 'Craven', 'how', 'well', 'directing', 'horror', 'shots', 'are', 'picked', 'created', 'most', 'dread', 'suspense', 'Foreshadowing', 'used', 'lot', 'film', 'very', 'stark', 'realistic', 'tone', 'only', 'problems', 'are', 'touchy', 'subject', 'film', 'so', 'realistic', 'can', 'understand', 'how', 'easily', 'upset', 'someone', 'might', 'get', 'problem', 'soundtrack', 'not', 'good', 'not', 'suspenseful', 'basically', 'light', '70s', 'rock', 'performances', 'are', 'done', 'well', 'killers', 'seem', 'ruthless', 'sociopaths', 'two', 'teenage', 'girls', 'dont', 'show', 'much', 'terror', 'would', 'be', 'expected', 'Maybe', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'shocked', 'very', 'first', 'scene', 'kinda', 'silly', 'rest', 'good', 'especially', 'final', 'part', 'middle', 'film', 'mostly', 'realistic', 'depiction', 'what', 'like', 'be', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'horror', 'film', 'horror', 'fans', 'should', 'definitely', 'see', 'major', 'film', 'history', 'horror', 'most', 'other', 'people', 'are', 'films', 'other', 'genres', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'graphic', 'are', 'revenge', 'flicks', 'could', 'enjoy', 'find', 'realistic', 'graphic', 'scenes', 'killing', 'rape', 'too', 'much', '5', 'stars', 'check', 'out', 'dare']",N/A
