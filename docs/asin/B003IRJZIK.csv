1346830,A3QVGCQL9D5KIH,B003IRJZIK,"Missouri Eagle ""Van""","[23, 23]","I have purchased dozens of DVD's and books related to the Civil War.  My particular interest is Missouri in the Civil War.  I have some of the Wide Awake Film releases, and truthfully most are lacking in real 'meat and potatoes' or balance of truth and historical accuracy vs. accepted and slanted facts.  August Light was a real surprise.  This DVD gives an excellent and accurate account of the events in Missouri and Kansas prior to the civil war as well as the Battle of Wilson's Creek.  Wilson's Creek was the second 'big' battle in the civil war.  August 1861 found Missouri embroiled in political and economic strife.  While the Union claimed Missour as a Union state, Missourians were not all on board.  Many southern sympathizers mostly in rural areas as well the Union loyal lived throughout Missouri.  Most families had men within their family on both sides.  The Union strongholds in St. Louis, Jefferson City, Rolla and Central Missouri acknowledged that Missouri was controlled politically by Union people but a large part of the populace had no interest in North or south.  The river and rail system of Missouri was deemed critical by both Union and confederacy.  A few Missourians did own slaves but the vast populace of Missouri did not.  Missourians were most interested in governing themselves and had little interest in being controlled by what they felt was a Union government that was attempting to interfere and control their lives, land, and families.Very few Civil War books, movies, or documentaries on the Civil War truly explore Missour and the West of the Mississipi area.  August Light does.  I live not far from Wilson's Creek and have visited it many times.  I've toured the grounds with guides, walked it with friends, and read most of the historical documentation available.  August Light captures the essence and historical facts exceptionally well.  Whether you're familiar with The Battle of Wilson's Creek or not, this DVD will give you an oustanding real understanding of the importance of this battle.",5,Excellent Documentary on Wilson's Creek,1294099200,"01 4, 2011",2011,2041,"['have', 'purchased', 'dozens', 'DVD', 'books', 'related', 'Civil', 'War', 'particular', 'interest', 'Missouri', 'Civil', 'War', 'have', 'Wide', 'Awake', 'Film', 'releases', 'truthfully', 'most', 'are', 'lacking', 'real', ""'meat"", 'potatoes', 'balance', 'truth', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'vs.', 'accepted', 'slanted', 'facts', 'August', 'Light', 'was', 'real', 'surprise', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'accurate', 'account', 'events', 'Missouri', 'Kansas', 'prior', 'civil', 'war', 'as', 'well', 'Battle', 'Wilson', 'Creek', 'Wilson', 'Creek', 'was', 'second', ""'big"", 'battle', 'civil', 'war', 'August', '1861', 'found', 'Missouri', 'embroiled', 'political', 'economic', 'strife', 'Union', 'claimed', 'Missour', 'Union', 'state', 'Missourians', 'were', 'not', 'board', 'Many', 'southern', 'sympathizers', 'mostly', 'rural', 'areas', 'as', 'well', 'Union', 'loyal', 'lived', 'Missouri', 'Most', 'families', 'had', 'men', 'family', 'sides', 'Union', 'strongholds', 'St.', 'Louis', 'Jefferson', 'City', 'Rolla', 'Central', 'Missouri', 'acknowledged', 'Missouri', 'was', 'controlled', 'politically', 'Union', 'people', 'large', 'part', 'populace', 'had', 'interest', 'North', 'south', 'river', 'rail', 'system', 'Missouri', 'was', 'deemed', 'critical', 'Union', 'confederacy', 'few', 'Missourians', 'did', 'own', 'slaves', 'vast', 'populace', 'Missouri', 'did', 'not', 'Missourians', 'were', 'most', 'interested', 'governing', 'had', 'little', 'interest', 'being', 'controlled', 'what', 'felt', 'was', 'Union', 'government', 'was', 'attempting', 'interfere', 'control', 'lives', 'land', 'families.Very', 'few', 'Civil', 'War', 'books', 'movies', 'documentaries', 'Civil', 'War', 'truly', 'explore', 'Missour', 'West', 'Mississipi', 'area', 'August', 'Light', 'live', 'not', 'far', 'Wilson', 'Creek', 'have', 'visited', 'many', 'times', ""'ve"", 'toured', 'grounds', 'guides', 'walked', 'friends', 'read', 'most', 'historical', 'documentation', 'available', 'August', 'Light', 'essence', 'historical', 'facts', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'Whether', ""'re"", 'familiar', 'Battle', 'Wilson', 'Creek', 'not', 'DVD', 'will', 'give', 'oustanding', 'real', 'understanding', 'importance', 'battle']",N/A
