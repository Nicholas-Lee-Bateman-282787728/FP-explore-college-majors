862312,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00067BBMI,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[2, 7]","Take moments of Blade Runner, the lost themes of Lost in Translation, and the haunting images of Gattaca and mix them all into a big bowl, your final product would look something like Code 46.  Winterbottom's vivid imagination and intelligent storytelling is proven once again as he successfully builds another chapter into sci-fi's growing history.  His ability to take a simple story about a forbidden love and transform it to a different time and culture was outstanding.  His themes of love, laws, and family are so dominate that he is able to handle them with the greatest of ease and use them to even paint a bolder picture.  Code 46 is an instant Winterbottom classic with the professionally superb acting by Robbins and Morton, the cinematic eye candy of our future, as well as a tight script that allows the viewer experience it over and over with new references every time.  Winterbottom proves that no genre is too small for him to tackle.To begin, look at that chemistry between Robbins and Morton.  The sparks were literally flying out of my television when they were together on-screen.  Their presence together fueled this film to a new level by creating a truth to their relationship.  We were rooting for something that was illegal in today's society as well as this fictitious futuristic one.  That is a hard concept to grasp for most audiences, but with Winterbottom behind the camera guiding this masters through the motions, it came across as nothing more than pure art.  Robbins has this ability to make every character he touches into this humanistic screen element of yourself.  You see yourself in this man as he struggles with the truths that surround him.  He isn't just having an affair, he is in love with someone that the law will not allow.  That would be hard to pull off for any actor, but Robbins seems to hit his mark with ease.  Morton is no different.  She has proven time and time again that she can handle the intense films, and Code 46 is yet another demonstration.  She handles herself so well, giving us so much from those big eyes that seem to speak for themselves.  We sympathize with her dilemma and want her to continue so that Robbins and her can meet again and again.  She is a very complex character with more layers that I could count, yet we see each and every one of them in Morton's role.  She holds nothing back and honestly gives 100% throughout the entire film.  That is hard for any actor to do, but Morton does it with the greatest of ease.  It is obvious that she will continue to be a strong cinematic force in Hollywood.Second to the phenomenal acting, you have a brilliantly colorful future.  While robots and genetics seem to be the dark horse of this civilization, it is a guiding light to see love emerge from it all.  The beauty of the city only enhances this sensation even stronger.  The contrast between the city and the desert looming outside shows no blurred lines.  It helps us to see the symbolic references to our society and the lack of change to this new one.  Winterbottom pulls no punches with his cinematography, taking ideas from Blade Runner and Gattaca, he thrives on the night and sunlight to show the horror and beauty of the surroundings.  He does not color coat anything with fake CGI, but instead places you in this very realistic world that could eerily happen tomorrow (watch the current news and you will see the reference).  Winterbottom does a great job of giving us both dimensions of this multi-faceted world.Finally, I have to applaud Winterbottom for the script that he chose.  Frank Boyce clearly has done his homework in both the sci-fi genre as well as the love-interest films.  He successfully combines the two into this brilliant display of both modern and post-modern culture.  He clearly defines the emotion of love through our characters, then throws a big shock through the system halfway into this epic.  What we know, or thought we knew about his world changes instantly, but in a very calm and crisp way.  He also imaginatively creates this era where languages do not divide us, but instead is required to know throughout the world.  I thoroughly loved the idea that everyone knows all languages.  It broke the thought that this was going to be an American film.  The concept of the virus was impeccable.  While not much is said about this invention, the consequences that it has on the film continually keep us on our toes.  The mind-shattering voiceovers coupled with the actors struggle only proves that Code 46's entire team was dedicated to the project, and sometimes that is a rarity in Hollywood.Overall, I thought this was a welcomed change to the recycled love story syndrome that seems to plague our screens as well as a bold step in the sci-fi direction.  Winterbottom continues to break new boundaries with his random choices of projects that impresses over and over and over again.  For those of you that did not understand this film, I ask (wait, request) that you see it again.  It cannot be enjoyed with just one viewing.  Code 46 is a multi-view film that opens itself more and more to you the more often you watch it.  This emotional film brought tears to my wife's eyes.  Impressive and challenging!

862313,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B00067BBMI,Alistair McHarg,"[2, 2]","There are some terrific ideas in Code 46, (along with wonderful, brooding music and intoxicating visuals), but they never deliver on their promise.  This is the most lethargic and droopy view of the future ever conceived; if we are to depend on Tim Robbins and Samantha Morton to save us from totalitarianism to come, the outlook is bleak.The premise has to do with genetic ""purity,"" which is assured by state-scrutinized and authorized reproduction.  Violators are prosecuted.  (Sound familiar?)  The effects on society resulting from such a homogenization are never examined.  (Indeed, a scrubbed and cleansed gene pool would mean no Beethoven, Van Gogh, or Churchill.)Also great fun is the notion of viruses enabling people to excel in unexpected ways, for example, William (Robbins), is given an ""empathy"" virus which makes it possible for him to sneak into the minds of hapless victims.  (Great at parties!)  Maria (Morton), experiments with a virus that allows her to sing in a language she doesn't know.  (Audiences love it, but she's frustrated because she can't understand herself!)  It's whacky.Robbins attempts to pass off boyish charm as acting - again, and Morton should have stood on director Winterbottom's shoulders in all scenes in which the two of them appear together.  (Robbins would be advised to spend the rest of his career making movies exclusively with Uma Thurman.)  Considering the two of them are quite literally throwing away their lives for each other, there should be passion, as it is, there isn't enough heat between them to set a Ray Bradbury novel on fire.Like Brazil and Bladerunner, Code 46 offers a view of the future that is at once retro and sleekly forward looking.  In those two classics the approach succeeds, in Code 46 it does not.  The cars of Code 46 look like they just rolled off the lot, the watch Robbins wears, and barters, looks like he got it from his dad, the subway Maria rides is neither vintage nor advanced.Creating a sci-fi flick is tough, and very expensive, but a sense of time and place matters.  Code 46 tries to dodge the bullet by pretending that desert sand dunes have melded with cityscapes just as all the earth's languages have melded.  The international flavor and mixture of races is interesting, and, like the gene fascism and viruses, could have been great were they to have been developed.  Unfortunately, they weren't.

I have personally watched it several times and with each viewing some of the subtleties of the implications of the society it portrays surface.From the various phrases from Arabic, Chinese, French and Spanish intermingled freely in the dialogue to an amalgam of a Shanghai as the ""inside"" of an Arabian desert ""outside"" to the Orwellian, dystopian world in which the characters live, it is a painfully frightful reminder of where our present seems to be headed.Code 46, the prohibition of breeding based on 25%, 50% or 100% DNA matches, is law.  The lingering question is what to do when the heart interferes with this law.  The on-screen chemistry between the two leads (Tim Robbins and Samantha, who plays Ian Curtis' wife in the biopicCONTROL (2007), also directed by Winterbottom) and the implications of the physical nature of their relationship is the major unexplored flaw in the film.Without giving away the ending, it does allow the consequences of Code 46 to play out but it leaves a certain ambiguity at the film's conclusion.Overall, however, this is a film well worth watching.

Skills can be acquired by the introduction of a recombinant bacterium. Memory can be altered. Within this ""trapped"" society there are still the last vestiges of freedom supplied by black marketeering and is rooted out by ""empathy"". Sound intriguing? So why is this so boring? Simple, they blew it.First I gonna say I'm gettin' mo and mo miffed that they made Lost in Translation. If I have to keep seeing these movies with the ""I haven't a clue which Metro I'm in"" look I'm going to scream. Second, Demonlover(which also employs the Metro look) and this ""film"" are fifty years late if they're thinking they're ""hip"" with the transworld language theme. Clouzot did it better in Wages of Fear in 1955.Speaking of other movies, The Claim and Wonderland are two much better bets by director Michael Winterbottom. Off hand, the only two movies of Tim Robbins' that I can think of  that are as bad as this one are Cadillac Man and Mission to Mars. Any of his other movies would be a better bet with Bob Roberts, The Hudsucker Proxy, The Shawshank Redemption and Short Cuts being must sees. I don't know much about Samantha Morton but her type of performing can be better seen in the films of Jane Campion and other films of the last decade or so coming out of Australia and New Zealand. Several movies that have the elements of Code 46 but are better bets or must sees are Gattaca, Fahrenheit 451, Wages of Fear, Lantana, Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind, THX1138, 12 Monkeys, Brazil and both the 1956 and 1984 versions of 1984. This is to name but a few.(Spoiler)The one saving grace for this movie was there seem to be some energy between Tim Robbins and Samantha Morton and love making seem to have some eroticism. That was until there was this absolutely gratuitous shot toward the end of what was obviously a body double's shaved private's. Mind you, I'm a big fan, no wait, A HUGE FAN, of nudity and I think if you are going to have love making(sex scenes)in a movie the participants should be able to make it believable by removing their clothes(depending upon the scene)(I've always hated sex, lies and videotape, what B.S.). If this is not to be had, as it seemed to be deemed in Code 46, than it's up to those involved to try to bring some eroticism, tension, energy to their scenes and I had thought they had done that(neat trick) and then this wholly out-of-place, gratuitous body double shot. It removed whatever eroticism there had been. It got me thinking about the film as a whole and it stinks.

Monday night is supposed to be my ""thinking night""; an ascetic alternative to the typically alcohol soaked weekends.  I've gone back and forth so many times about my opinion on this movie.  Last night however, I decided I'd thought about reviewing this movie once to many times.  So, my best shot.As expressed in the title, I don't think Code 46 is a good movie.  I agree with most of the critics as it relates to the storyline (full of holes and cliche), and I don't particularly remember a standout performance by either Tim Robbins or Samantha Morton.  I do however remember the movie...often.I've basically distilled down the value of Code 46 to this: a world-class ""ambient film"".This is a beautiful movie to watch.  Set in near-future Shanghai, it consistently presents vividly attractive sets, with hauntingly beautiful music.  Bear with me a second here, but if you took a random collection of good movies (as a control group), and randomly snapped pictures of scenes, then hung them on a wall, my bet is that Code 46 would consistently compel a more significant emotional response.Hardly a reason to watch this film.  I'm a Sci-Fi buff, I really look forward to good plot development, good effects, good acting.  This movie scores poorly in those verticals.  However, with all the crummy media out there, when a certain piece comes along that leaves an impression, any impression, it's worth noting in my opinion.This movie is worth watching.  Put it on before going to bed, let the cinematography and score wash over you. It sets a powerful and interesting mood for emotion.

After all Robbins is well to do, educated, handsome and tall where Morton exudes none of these characteristics. A less capable director would have taken the easy road and selected a beautiful, tall cover girl for Robbins. But director Michael Winterbottom chose Morton, and let the storyline and acting abilities of the characters convince viewers that the relationship is both plausible and real. And Morton is a convincing seductress. She plays quite a natural cat and mouse game of sexual and emotional fulfillment: extending her affection at times, then pulling back at other times. Keep in mind that Robbins is more than a chance encounter and romance, but the fulfillment of a dream. Any male could have taken the place of Robbins: he just happened to be in the right place under the right circumstances.I could not foresee an ending more tragic. Both Robbins and Morton engage in a affair which both know must end. An affair which is both illicit and illegal.

They loved ""The Matrix"" because they thought it was ""cool"" (the all-encompassing word for hip and stylish but really another of those words that mean absolutely nothing in this blank generation) but I suspect it had a lot more to do with Keanu Reeves and marketing. ""Code 46"" is far better than any of the above. Of course, I know that I'm in the minority here - I think that ""Dark City"" and ""Thirteenth Floor"" were far superior to ""Matrix"" also.""Code 46"" is set in a dystopic future where the Sphinx Corporation have taken over the world. By the world, of course, we really mean, the CITIES since the undesirables (the diseased, the genetically inferior, etc.) are outcasts outside the CITIES. The world as we know it is a network of cities and the entrance checkpoint to every city requires the entrant to be equipped with a papelle (some kind of ""genetic"" passport, if you will). Violation of ""Code 46"" means that people with similar traits in their genetic structure have babies together - thus producing potentially genetic-inferiors. Tim Robbins play an agent investigating a factory in Shanghai producing fake papelles. Samantha Morton plays the girl working in that factory who is responsible for the fake papelles (which she then sells to the undesirables so that they too can live in cities or travel to other cities). They both have similar genetic traits (owing to excessive cloning activities in the previous generations). Problem was, Tim and Samantha fell in love and had a one-night-stand. From that point onwards, it's a painful love story of two people trying to beat the system by loving each other and trying to break the brainwashing, memory-tampering, forced-abortion techniques of the System (in this case, the Sphinx Corp).Throughout the movie, people speak a sort of ""universal"" language - somewhat a mish-mash mixture of English, French, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, and everything else. Everyone uses the same papelles to enter cities. Everyone accepts that if the Sphinx decides on anything, there must be a good reason behind it. Everyone consults the Sphinx for ""permission"" to fall in love with each other (by taking a ""genetic"" test for potential similarities). In fact, the only people who seemed to behave like people are the outcasts who long to enter into cities. Problem is, they live in the lawless, diseased, desert-like conditions outside the cities. The whole thing comes off like a nightmarish version of what our world seemed to be falling headlong into. This is a world where basic things like love, sex, reproduction, realizing one's dreams, etc. are regulated by an all-seeing System.Finally, I like it that it doesn't try to be ""preachy"" with endless exposition like ""The Matrix"" - the viewer is simply presented directly with this ""world"" and you have to try your best to understand the whole thing (somewhat like Enki Bilal's ""Immortel"", if you see the parallels).

He identifies one Maria (Samantha Morton) who has been narrating our story and whose birthday has arrived, as the possible source of false covers.

Whereas ""Gattaca"" is a complex, fascinating, well-acted and well-scripted sci-fi film, ""Code 46"" suffers from a plot without real sense and two lead actors who cannot make us care too much about them.An adulterous and short-lived affair between the character of Maria (Samantha Morton) and the guy investigating her for selling papeles (Tim Robbins) is cut short by Robbins, who needs to return to the city where his wife and son live. It's hard to drum up sympathy for the affair, which seems initially to be a matter of convenience.But then the film switches mid-gear. All of a sudden, this short affair is touted as a great love affair, and Robbins tries to find Maria, only to discover that her memory was wiped and the foetus that resulted from their having sex has been aborted. This is because their affair violated Code 46 - i.e., sexual relationship with someone who is genetically too similar to oneself.The viewer is left to guess that this is because of cloning. To be honest, it could be because of odd mutations, of strange delineations in calling some types of genetic codes ""similar"", or anything else - because it's never stated.Robbins now sets out to re-awaken Maria's memory of him, and to bypass the automatic rejection mode implanted in her consciousness with regards to having sex with him. It becomes silly... and once again, the pair are caught out, with Robbins' character having HIS memory wiped this time, and Maria sent into exile.There are some truly foolish elements in this story - including the empathy virus, the whole issue of the state assuming responsibility for aborting someone's child and wiping an individual's memory, the lack of explanation about why some people are denied papeles... It's as though some good ideas were presented, but the scriptwriter was too lazy to incorporate them and explain them.The character of Maria has dreamed every year of a mysterious and somehow meaningful train journey, in which she must reach a destination or forever be lost. It's actually not a bad idea - it could have worked. But... it fails in the execution, and it fails as a reasonable element in the storyline.The final image of Maria, exiled in the desert area, is quite poignant, but it's really the only image that works.I think the main disappointment for me was the lacklustre acting.

Although there was not a great chase scene or any gunfights (as Hollywood has led us to believe all good sci-fi movies should have), the film gave me a lot more to think about than any action-packed sci-fi film. And, if you really get into the film (as I did), there is some suspense towards the end.I can't resist comparing it to Gattaca, in that it deals more with ethical situations in a futuristic world. Although it was a little slow in parts and the pairing of Robbins and Morton is a little unsettling, I loved this movie. The little details, like the way languages had converged, give the viewer something to think about during the slower parts of this brilliant film.

Disease and other biological complications have led to the cloning of humans in order to restore the human species, which has also led the world to create a number of rules and one of these rules is Code 46.  Code 46 states that people with 25 percent or more similar DNA cannot copulate, and if pregnancy is accomplished then the pregnancy will be terminated.  In addition, if Code 46 is intentionally broken it is a criminal act which will be punished accordingly.  Thus, in order to maintain the human species a dystopian atmosphere has been generated where emotion is secondary and biological purpose primary.William (Tim Robbins), an intuitive agent for the Sphinx Corporation, arrives to Shanghai in order to investigate inside theft of papeles, paperwork that allows for travel between different zones of the world.  Through the investigation William meets Maria (Samantha Morton), the thief of the papeles, but instead of handing her over to the superiors he lets her go.  This displays William's personal motives as he has fallen in love with Maria, and begins to follow her immediately as she leaves the company grounds.It is Maria's birthday and on each of her previous birthdays she had experienced a recurring dream about riding on a train that brings her one stop closer to her destiny.  This birthday is the birthday that is suppose to bring her to the final stop where her destiny awaits her.  When Maria bumps into William on the train, as he has been following her, she seems to grasp the moment as she invites him on an unforgettable journey as she is aware of him knowing her secret.Through Maria's birthday celebration William gets to meet one man who has bought a papele from her, and she points out the happiness the man displays as he is given the papele.  This moment of emotion is the reason for her theft of the papeles from the Sphinx Corporation, which appears to be something new for William.  The supreme intuition that William possesses is the result of a virus that he has taken as viruses can function as a serviceable tool.  In William's case the intuition virus aids him on to determine whether a person is telling the truth or not, however, he seems incapable of feeling and expressing the emotions that begin to emerge within him as he is lost in confusion between biological nature and empathy-like emotion.Code 46 brings the audience a disconnected science fiction tale where empathy is a lost relic from the past, and science is what has saved mankind.  Nonetheless, Winterbottom produces a story which emotionally could be compared to Lost In Translation (2003), but it does not generate the same brilliance that Sophia Coppola accomplished in her film.  For example, the futuristic atmosphere is occasionally interrupted by ""present time"" segments such as when William rents a car.  Overall, Code 46 does not bring a new concept to the relationship between emotions and science as it can be experienced in other films, but Winterbottom creates a new angle on this concept as it leaves the audience with an indifferent and clever cinematic experience with some notions to be pondered.",4,Dystopian Atmosphere Where DNA & Emotions Clashes...,1104710400,"01 3, 2005",2005,3251,"['future', 'where', 'people', 'world', 'are', 'united', 'sun', 'all', 'living', 'ozone', 'layer', 'more', 'less', 'depleted', 'Disease', 'other', 'biological', 'complications', 'have', 'led', 'cloning', 'humans', 'order', 'restore', 'human', 'species', 'also', 'led', 'world', 'create', 'number', 'rules', 'one', 'rules', 'Code', '46', 'Code', '46', 'states', 'people', '25', 'percent', 'more', 'similar', 'DNA', 'can', 'not', 'copulate', 'pregnancy', 'accomplished', 'then', 'pregnancy', 'will', 'be', 'terminated', 'addition', 'Code', '46', 'intentionally', 'broken', 'criminal', 'act', 'will', 'be', 'punished', 'accordingly', 'Thus', 'order', 'maintain', 'human', 'dystopian', 'atmosphere', 'been', 'generated', 'where', 'emotion', 'secondary', 'biological', 'purpose', 'primary.William', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'intuitive', 'agent', 'Sphinx', 'Corporation', 'Shanghai', 'order', 'investigate', 'inside', 'theft', 'papeles', 'paperwork', 'travel', 'different', 'zones', 'world', 'investigation', 'William', 'Maria', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'thief', 'papeles', 'instead', 'handing', 'superiors', 'go', 'William', 'personal', 'motives', 'fallen', 'love', 'Maria', 'follow', 'immediately', 'company', 'grounds.It', 'Maria', 'birthday', 'previous', 'birthdays', 'had', 'experienced', 'recurring', 'dream', 'riding', 'train', 'one', 'stop', 'closer', 'destiny', 'birthday', 'birthday', 'suppose', 'bring', 'final', 'stop', 'where', 'destiny', 'When', 'Maria', 'William', 'train', 'been', 'following', 'grasp', 'moment', 'unforgettable', 'journey', 'aware', 'knowing', 'secret.Through', 'Maria', 'birthday', 'celebration', 'William', 'meet', 'one', 'man', 'who', 'bought', 'papele', 'out', 'happiness', 'man', 'given', 'papele', 'moment', 'emotion', 'reason', 'theft', 'papeles', 'Sphinx', 'Corporation', 'be', 'something', 'new', 'William', 'supreme', 'intuition', 'William', 'result', 'virus', 'taken', 'viruses', 'can', 'function', 'serviceable', 'tool', 'William', 'case', 'intuition', 'virus', 'determine', 'person', 'telling', 'truth', 'not', 'however', 'incapable', 'feeling', 'expressing', 'emotions', 'begin', 'emerge', 'lost', 'confusion', 'biological', 'nature', 'empathy-like', 'emotion.Code', '46', 'audience', 'disconnected', 'science', 'fiction', 'tale', 'where', 'empathy', 'lost', 'relic', 'past', 'science', 'what', 'saved', 'mankind', 'Nonetheless', 'Winterbottom', 'story', 'emotionally', 'could', 'be', 'compared', 'Lost', 'Translation', '2003', 'not', 'generate', 'same', 'brilliance', 'Sophia', 'Coppola', 'accomplished', 'film', 'example', 'futuristic', 'atmosphere', 'occasionally', 'interrupted', 'present', 'time', 'segments', 'such', 'when', 'William', 'car', 'Overall', 'Code', '46', 'not', 'bring', 'new', 'concept', 'relationship', 'emotions', 'science', 'can', 'be', 'experienced', 'other', 'films', 'Winterbottom', 'new', 'angle', 'concept', 'audience', 'indifferent', 'clever', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'notions', 'be', 'pondered']",N/A
862336,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00067BBMI,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 7]","There is some detailed reading involved at the start of ""Code 46"" in which we are presented with the code in all of its sections.  It basically boils down to a law that prohibits you from breeding with anybody with who you have a genetic match of 25%, 50%, or 100%, which the code considers to be identical.  Of course, as soon as you read this you know what is going to happen in this 2003 film and that the characters played by Tim Robbins and Samantha Morton are going to be in violation of Code 46 (the name makes you curious as to what the first 45 codes in this dystopian future are all about).  There are also a series of punishments outlined and you know those will come into play as well.The reason for the code is that cloning, embryo splitting and in-vitro fertilization are the norms in world that has been divided into two sides that basically represent the haves and the havenots.  William Geld (Robbins) is a fraud investigator who shows up in Shanghai on the trail of someone who is making and selling ""papelles,"" which are what people in this dystopian world need to travel from one zone to another.  The criminal turns out to be Maria (Morton), and rather than turn her in he falls in love with her and violates Code 46 for the first, but not the last, time.  William returns to his family, but haunted by Maria he tries to find her again and when he is trapped because his papelle has expired he needs her to create a new one.  However, her memory has been wiped clean of their Code 46 violation.While watching ""Code 46"" I was waiting for the point where we would get to the payoff for the movie and the whole Code 46 bit.  When that came I was suddenly reminded of the line in Woody Allen's ""Mighty Aphrodite"" when Jocasta tells the camera, ""I hate to tell you what they call my son in Harlem.""  The Oedipus idea is made explicit when you watch the short featurette about the film on the DVD.  But then ""Oedipus Rex"" was never a love story: it was about what happens when you dare to contest your fate.  More people who read the play never catch that the prophecy that Oedipus is told is not the same as what was told his parents and that the incest is an additional punishment for which he is not responsible.  But in ""Code 46"" this is a genetic taboo and what William has to contend with is not fate but an ""empathy"" virus, a genetic enhancement that allows him to his job.As a result, this is a love story where the passion is served cold.  We are supposed to be thinking George Orwell's ""Nineteen Eighty-Four"" but I kept thinking more along the lines of George Lucas's ""THX 1138,"" which is the film that always comes to mind when I am thinking about particularly sterile visions of the future.  The science and the laws of this dystopia end up being more interesting than the forbidden romance, which certainly works against your enjoyment of this film.  The irony is that that the science and the laws are supposed to be the backdrop for the story and the excuse to come up with a plausible scenario in which this particular taboo can be approached as a love story but it becomes the more interesting part.  At least with George Winston there was desperateness to his affair that represented the human spirit, but William comes across as being as detached from his love life as he is from his fraud investigations.  By the time we get to the twists at the end and consider the resolution of the storyline our empathy has not been engaged and our intellect remains detached.",3,Sometimes a forbidden love is a fairly boring love,1113004800,"04 9, 2005",2005,3498,"['detailed', 'reading', 'involved', 'start', 'Code', '46', 'are', 'presented', 'code', 'sections', 'basically', 'down', 'law', 'breeding', 'anybody', 'who', 'have', 'genetic', 'match', '25', '%', '50', '%', '100', '%', 'code', 'considers', 'be', 'identical', 'course', 'as', 'soon', 'read', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'happen', '2003', 'film', 'characters', 'played', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'violation', 'Code', '46', 'name', 'curious', 'what', 'first', '45', 'codes', 'dystopian', 'future', 'are', 'are', 'also', 'series', 'punishments', 'outlined', 'know', 'will', 'come', 'play', 'well.The', 'reason', 'code', 'cloning', 'embryo', 'splitting', 'in-vitro', 'fertilization', 'are', 'norms', 'world', 'been', 'divided', 'two', 'sides', 'basically', 'represent', 'haves', 'havenots', 'William', 'Geld', 'Robbins', 'fraud', 'investigator', 'who', 'up', 'Shanghai', 'trail', 'someone', 'who', 'making', 'selling', 'papelles', 'are', 'what', 'people', 'dystopian', 'world', 'need', 'travel', 'one', 'zone', 'criminal', 'out', 'be', 'Maria', 'Morton', 'rather', 'turn', 'love', 'Code', '46', 'first', 'not', 'last', 'time', 'William', 'family', 'haunted', 'Maria', 'find', 'again', 'when', 'trapped', 'papelle', 'expired', 'create', 'new', 'one', 'However', 'memory', 'been', 'wiped', 'clean', 'Code', '46', 'violation.While', 'watching', 'Code', '46', 'was', 'waiting', 'point', 'where', 'would', 'get', 'payoff', 'movie', 'whole', 'Code', '46', 'bit', 'When', 'came', 'was', 'suddenly', 'reminded', 'line', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Mighty', 'Aphrodite', 'when', 'Jocasta', 'camera', 'hate', 'tell', 'what', 'call', 'son', 'Harlem', 'Oedipus', 'idea', 'made', 'explicit', 'when', 'watch', 'short', 'featurette', 'film', 'DVD', 'then', 'Oedipus', 'Rex', 'was', 'never', 'love', 'story', 'was', 'what', 'when', 'dare', 'contest', 'fate', 'More', 'people', 'who', 'read', 'play', 'never', 'catch', 'prophecy', 'Oedipus', 'told', 'not', 'same', 'what', 'was', 'told', 'parents', 'incest', 'additional', 'punishment', 'not', 'responsible', 'Code', '46', 'genetic', 'taboo', 'what', 'William', 'contend', 'not', 'fate', 'empathy', 'virus', 'genetic', 'enhancement', 'job.As', 'result', 'love', 'story', 'where', 'passion', 'served', 'cold', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'thinking', 'George', 'Orwell', 'Nineteen', 'Eighty-Four', 'kept', 'thinking', 'more', 'lines', 'George', 'Lucas', 'THX', '1138', 'film', 'always', 'mind', 'when', 'am', 'thinking', 'particularly', 'sterile', 'visions', 'future', 'science', 'laws', 'dystopia', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'more', 'interesting', 'forbidden', 'romance', 'certainly', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'irony', 'science', 'laws', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'backdrop', 'story', 'excuse', 'come', 'up', 'plausible', 'scenario', 'particular', 'taboo', 'can', 'be', 'approached', 'love', 'story', 'more', 'interesting', 'part', 'least', 'George', 'Winston', 'was', 'desperateness', 'affair', 'represented', 'human', 'spirit', 'William', 'across', 'as', 'being', 'detached', 'love', 'life', 'fraud', 'investigations', 'time', 'get', 'twists', 'end', 'consider', 'resolution', 'storyline', 'empathy', 'not', 'been', 'engaged', 'intellect', 'detached']",N/A

The photography is appropriate for the mood it intends to convey and the story, as well as the characters, have debt and dimension. I dont understand the overall low rating of this movie as unlike a lot of the garbage the US has been making in the sci-fi, futuristic department lately, this movie from the UK was fabulous - from plausibility to originality of story telling.It is about a future in which genetic engineering and such things as IVF and cloning are common place; It is a future where genetic profiling is also common-place and where couples can submit their genes and have it analyzed within minutes for compatibility. Because IVF and cloning are so commonplace, there exist certain ""quality control"" laws to prevent reproduction between two individuals that are genetically too close. This is ""Code 46"".That's the backdrop to the real plot here which is a love story between two people. William (Tim Robbins)  is in Shanghai to investigate a case and he meets Maria (Samantha Morton) whom he falls for and spends a passionate night with. He leaves the next day as he has a wife and a child in Seattle. He cannot forget about Maria, however, and seeks her out the next time he is back in Shanghai. She has disappeared, however. Turns out, she has violated Code 46 and was taken away to be ""taken care of"". When having her DNA analyzed, he finds out that he ""must not liaison with her"" as their DNA is 50% identical and her DNA is 100% identical to that of his mother's.I dont want to reveal too much about what happens at this point but it is sort of like ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"". William and Maria fall in love again; a bad decision in a time and place where they are not supposed to be together by law.Like I said, I dont get all these negative reviews, undoubtedly by some religious nut jobs, calling this movie filthy or about incest. That is nonsense and far from it. These people are not committing incest in what we understand as incest. The truth is that they live in a future where cloning and IVF are commonplace requiring checks and certain measures to prevent genetic defects. William and Maria dont know each other. They never met. But they fall in love and are unfortunate in that they live in a society where cloning has become so common that 5 out of 10 people they meet on the street could be related to them. It is not their fault nor is it to their knowledge that they are related. And even after William finds out - well, since he has never met this woman and she is not his mother, only genetically identical to her, he doesnt feel like it is wrong or like he is sleeping with his mom.In short, this movie is fantastic. It draws you in - especially the parts that take you into a future that is not too far off from where we are today and yet so fantastic and far away.

It puts together a few elements:  superb multi-ethnic futuristic realism, the incomparable Samantha Morton, and some genetic ""rules"" plot basics, and then weaves nothing more, nor less, than a purely emotional exploration of two lovers.  No Gattaca plot twists, a thorough absence of conventional story telling, no attempt to incorporate the audience's expectations -- only their emotions.  The sountrack, ambient Silver Mt Zion type music, is the constant as we watch Samantha Morton to Tim Robbins straight man explore their emotions.  As strange as it sounds, the movie should be classed with ""Crazy/Beautiful"" and ""Lost in Translation"" rather than with ""Gattaca.""  Like the first two, it centers really on a young woman exploring her emotions and questions about love and life, putting her conventional thinking largely on hold.  It's equally as poignant, though far less accessible than either of these.  All three movies rely on whether you can be swept away by the magnetic performances of the female leads.The movie will disappoint you if you're waiting for it to meet any of your expectations, but if you can open up to something purely emotional, it rewards richly.  Like ""Lost in Translation,"" it can be a very personal experience to watch.  Never use it as a Friday night feel good date-movie!

The acting was quite okay. It is worth a look for someone who knows what they are getting into.Personally I found the holes too distracting. I am normally able to suspend disbelief, but for some reason found it difficult to do with this film and that resulted in ""what the heck?"" distractions. A lot of this was with the science and maybe others would not have this problem and could just go with the flow of the premise -- which is worth thinking about I agree.But to echo other reviews -- this is no GATTACA!!! That was a very well crafted film and made its points clearly. It was a classic in my opinion. This one sort of fizzled in the classic competition. Too bad, because there were a lot of possibilities here, and again if you are interested in IDEAS in sci fi then this is very much worth watching. If you want an elegant and convincing presentation of the ideas then you may be asking too much of this film.PLOT SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!!!When I say distracting an example would be a powerful scene that was sadly diminished for me by earlier improbabilities  in the film. I will mention it because it may come through better for viewers if they are prepared for it and not put off by some of the earlier holes in the film. Robbins discovers that his love compulsion Samantha Morton is roughly a clone of his mother. Her mind wants sex with him but her body has been programmed to resist. So she has him tie her up and in a sense rape her. He loves her so much that he quite willingly goes along with it and ""rapes"" her. A friend with me could not watch that scene. I was busy trying to square the science up with the plot and did not find it so powerful as it was intended. I kept thinking how could she not look more like his mother -- diet and so on should not have so much of an effect. They went through that too quickly and if they had explained for example that he had not seen a picture of his mother at that age or that as a clone  he never had seen his mother etc. then that would have helped keep me from distraction.Also it was hard for me to imagine that programming with viruses could control such very specific behaviours, not primarily ""incest detection"" but also Robbins' almost supernatural virus implanted empathy powers. If I had been able to take that on faith, then I would have found this particular scene even more powerful. If he could see into her mind while he was raping her, with the conflict between her mind's desire for him and her body's fear of incest, then what was going on in his own head? But the potential emotional complexity of the scene was greatly diminished because I kept dwelling on my rational concerns with the science.Yet the key  idea in this particular respect that in a world sprinkled abundantly with clones human sexual interrelationships could get to be somewhat ""problematic"" is worth exploring.

Most of them are true in that they describe roughly what happens, but they're misrepresentative in that they don't really show how little actually happens in this movie.A guy named William is investigating fraudalent ""papelles"" when he meets a woman named Maria, who he falls in love with.  This is bad because due to the futuristic society where clones can cause problems with genetic discrepancies, they shouldn't breed.  Thus they aren't allowed to be together and the evil society hunts them down while they attempt to run.It's basically a series of genre conceits, which is alright except it's loosely cut--more like stapled--together with a loose assortment of ideas and a really bad voice-over.  Most importantly, it doesn't go anywhere.  At times it seems like it wants to have some interesting ideas, but then it decides not to explore it, instead just going on and letting us assume that this story means something.I only found two things interesting with it: the abuses of authority William has when he has the virus and the potential Oedipal nature of his relationship with Maria.  Neither were explored because it seems the writer didn't care.  All we know is that these two people are apparently in love (despite next to no chemistry) and that somehow it needs to be illegal to warn about a society set too strictly.  The only theme is the importance of living up to risks, but even that seems to be underdeveloped...  nothing really goes anywhere here.To be perfectly honest, it seems almost as if this movie goes on a tight budget until the money runs out... and then the filmmakers dropped everything and cut it together using serrated scissors in a dark room.  It looks like everyone involved WANTS to really explore this brave new world, but nobody ultimately had the resources.  However, it's practically pointless to try to think about what this film could have been, considering it pretty much isn't anything anyway.--PolarisDiB",2,Incomplete and Indiscreet.,1152489600,"07 10, 2006",2006,2078,"['What', 'interesting', 'film', 'almost', 'blurbs', 'synopses', 'give', 'more', 'plot', 'actually', 'Most', 'are', 'true', 'describe', 'roughly', 'what', ""'re"", 'misrepresentative', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'show', 'how', 'little', 'actually', 'movie.A', 'guy', 'named', 'William', 'investigating', 'fraudalent', 'papelles', 'when', 'woman', 'named', 'Maria', 'who', 'love', 'bad', 'due', 'futuristic', 'society', 'where', 'clones', 'can', 'cause', 'problems', 'genetic', 'discrepancies', 'should', ""n't"", 'breed', 'are', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'be', 'together', 'evil', 'society', 'hunts', 'down', 'attempt', 'run.It', 'basically', 'series', 'genre', 'conceits', 'alright', 'loosely', 'cut', 'more', 'stapled', 'together', 'loose', 'assortment', 'ideas', 'really', 'bad', 'voice-over', 'Most', 'importantly', ""n't"", 'go', 'anywhere', 'times', 'have', 'interesting', 'ideas', 'then', 'not', 'explore', 'instead', 'just', 'going', 'letting', 'assume', 'story', 'something.I', 'only', 'found', 'two', 'things', 'interesting', 'abuses', 'authority', 'William', 'when', 'virus', 'potential', 'Oedipal', 'nature', 'relationship', 'Maria', 'were', 'explored', 'writer', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'know', 'two', 'people', 'are', 'apparently', 'love', 'next', 'chemistry', 'somehow', 'be', 'illegal', 'warn', 'society', 'set', 'too', 'strictly', 'only', 'theme', 'importance', 'living', 'up', 'risks', 'even', 'be', 'underdeveloped', 'nothing', 'really', 'anywhere', 'here.To', 'be', 'perfectly', 'honest', 'almost', 'movie', 'tight', 'budget', 'money', 'out', 'then', 'filmmakers', 'dropped', 'everything', 'cut', 'together', 'using', 'serrated', 'scissors', 'dark', 'room', 'everyone', 'involved', 'WANTS', 'really', 'explore', 'brave', 'new', 'world', 'nobody', 'ultimately', 'had', 'resources', 'However', 'practically', 'pointless', 'try', 'think', 'what', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'considering', 'pretty', 'much', ""n't"", 'anything', 'anyway.', 'PolarisDiB']",N/A

I honestly can't think of any other source for films this ecclectic and uncompramised.  Every one is completely different.  I LOVE THIS MOVE.  I love everything about it.  If you gave me cameras, film, production money, the principle actors, and all the existing footage with the chance to change anything I wanted about it, I honestly can't think of anything I'd change about it.  Gorgeous, gorgeous film making.  It amazes me they had such a tiny budget and had to go guerrilla-style in many locations, yet still managed to get sufficient shots.  And what shots!  I so wish I'd seen it in the theater, but I don't ever remember even hearing about it.  The photography and post DI tweaking are lovely.  The colors have such subtlety and transparency you really need a DVD player or computer hardware that will not blow colors out or mess up the picture's dynamic range.  Anywoo, that's probably a little techy for most of you.  Such courageous, forward writing.  Tons of heart.  Lovely acting with a totally authentic sense of the characters.  This director is very good with actors, and his relationship with his editor in which takes they've chosen is obviously as good as director/editor chemistry gets.The film is not blatently caught up in gadgets and futurism looks, which other directors have tried to also stay away from (Spielberg, Proyas) only to create alternate, obviously far future settings that shout PRODUCTION DESIGN!  Not here.  It's completely believable in look, with just enough PD to set the era but always keeping it grounded, human, liveable as people truely do.  Just believable and right.  With China as a multicultural, multilinguistic economic powerhouse, which all the data indicates they are becoming.  The intriguing concept of privatized universal healthcare, pseudo-governmental corporate employer/conglomerates funding it, and their fusion with passport Visa's and lifestyle/genetic risk assessments.  Pure genius.  With many of the centrist economies of the world, it's certainly a possibility.  And the gap between the 1st/2nd World and 3rd World isn't getting better, but worse...especially as economic integration and technology accelerate in the advanced nations, the rest are getting left behind.  It's all just very well thought out for a premise.  I found no difficulty in suspending disbelief because I understood the plausability of it all. And I haven't even gotten into the test tube babies and cloning issues brought up.  Code 46 doesn't make statements, but simply assumes if it does continue to develop where would it go and how would it affect people...people who will still be living their lives regardless, on a day to day ordinary level that's so familiar to us.  And still the characters have come first.  The premises and everything that goes with them are secondary to the interactions, the words, the feelings...so much so that the setups and information presented to us earlier can't shout or give anything away to the point of disrupting or pushing us outside the film because we're so involved in the people.  Winterbottom and Boyce succeeded in all they attempted, I think.  Maybe this film isn't everyone's cup of tea, but it sure is mine.

862351,A18TSDA9ZRLKVM,B00067BBMI,"Robert S. ""geek hipster""","[1, 3]","Code 46 is an interesting and frustrating mix of elements.  Some work, some don't.  The mood and concept of 'Brief Encounter' or 'Lost in translation' updated into a 1st world meets 3rd world dystopian future is unique and compelling. The background elements, actors, and language (all the speech containing random bits of french and spanish), give the world a coherent mystery vibe that was entrancing.  In addition, the soundtrack is especially excellent in a worldbeat meets ambient Brian Eno vein.  Youtube the title track 'Inside/Outside' - it's beautiful and nifty.  The song 'Warning sign' by Coldplay is also used to great effect.What's glaringly wrong with this movie is that it uses an antiseptic future incest, ie- people who are test tube babies from the same mother's DNA meeting and falling in love, but doesn't know what to do with the idea other than explore it in a tactless and lazy way. It often feels like there were 2 film crews, working against eachother.  Alone, each character is well-detailed and their relationship to their world defines the world around them with little exposition, which I liked.  The world feels mysterious and interesting, ala Casablanca or Bladerunner.  But every time the action shifts to Tim Robbins and Samantha Morton together, the camera work and editing goes into this sloppy documentary/cinema verite style that's at odds with the elegantly clean motifs of the world. The chemistry just isn't there between these 2, and it makes you notice the shifts in tone, they don't transition well.*spoiler alert*The problem with this filmAt the point I reached the awkward 3rd act first person POV love/rape scene where Samantha Morton is chained to a bed while the cameraman sits on top of her and she spouts 'I love you' over and over, I felt the director had nothing to say, other than to use what he had created for an emotionally exploitive rape of the audience, by forcing us to watch the rape of the main character, like we're doing it. I'm assuming Tim Robbins didn't want to have to be in the picture at this point, I mean, who would?  As a viewer, I found the scene tasteless, overwrought and just plain bad.I understand using story to explain the thing you don't want to explain... the narrative device of mood-altering retroviruses that change the behavior of the main characters, but I also understand that since the story resolves nothing (since Tim Robbins conveniently gets his memories erased) the viruses and technology amount to  MacGuffins that simply aid in propelling us towards this ridiculous rape scene that the author takes no responsibility for, and I find that willfully bad writing in the service of a voyeuristic anti-entertainment. And just for context, I like the films of Pedro Almodovar and Alejandro Jodorowsky, who use plenty of shocking imagery and tableau, but a good director knows the line and how to cross it.  Michael Winterbottom doesn't.  This isn't art.I wouldn't be so annoyed if the rest of the film didn't have promising and excellent qualities.  But at the core it's a messy, emotionally dishonest confessional on the order of films like 'Powder' or 'Tideland'.  I've got no use for it.2 stars for world-design and the excellent soundtrack.",2,Arthouse Sci-fi Incest Mess,1337817600,"05 24, 2012",2012,3234,"['Code', '46', 'interesting', 'frustrating', 'mix', 'elements', 'work', 'do', ""n't"", 'mood', 'concept', ""'Brief"", 'Encounter', ""'Lost"", 'translation', 'updated', '1st', 'world', 'meets', '3rd', 'world', 'dystopian', 'future', 'unique', 'compelling', 'background', 'elements', 'actors', 'language', 'speech', 'containing', 'random', 'bits', 'french', 'spanish', 'give', 'world', 'coherent', 'mystery', 'vibe', 'was', 'entrancing', 'addition', 'soundtrack', 'especially', 'excellent', 'worldbeat', 'ambient', 'Brian', 'Eno', 'vein', 'Youtube', 'title', 'track', ""'Inside/Outside"", 'beautiful', 'nifty', 'song', ""'Warning"", 'sign', 'Coldplay', 'also', 'used', 'great', 'effect.What', 'glaringly', 'wrong', 'movie', 'antiseptic', 'future', 'incest', 'ie-', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'test', 'tube', 'babies', 'same', 'mother', 'DNA', 'meeting', 'falling', 'love', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'idea', 'other', 'tactless', 'lazy', 'way', 'often', 'were', '2', 'film', 'crews', 'working', 'eachother', 'Alone', 'character', 'well-detailed', 'relationship', 'world', 'world', 'little', 'exposition', 'liked', 'world', 'mysterious', 'interesting', 'ala', 'Casablanca', 'Bladerunner', 'time', 'action', 'shifts', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'together', 'camera', 'work', 'editing', 'sloppy', 'documentary/cinema', 'verite', 'style', 'odds', 'elegantly', 'clean', 'motifs', 'world', 'chemistry', 'just', ""n't"", '2', 'notice', 'shifts', 'tone', 'do', ""n't"", 'transition', 'well', '*spoiler', 'alert*The', 'problem', 'point', 'reached', 'awkward', '3rd', 'act', 'first', 'person', 'POV', 'love/rape', 'scene', 'where', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'chained', 'bed', 'cameraman', 'sits', 'top', 'spouts', 'love', 'felt', 'director', 'had', 'nothing', 'say', 'other', 'use', 'what', 'had', 'created', 'emotionally', 'exploitive', 'rape', 'audience', 'forcing', 'watch', 'rape', 'main', 'character', ""'re"", 'doing', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'have', 'be', 'picture', 'point', 'mean', 'who', 'would', 'viewer', 'found', 'scene', 'tasteless', 'overwrought', 'just', 'plain', 'bad.I', 'understand', 'using', 'story', 'explain', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'explain', 'narrative', 'device', 'mood-altering', 'retroviruses', 'change', 'behavior', 'main', 'characters', 'also', 'understand', 'story', 'nothing', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'conveniently', 'memories', 'erased', 'viruses', 'technology', 'amount', 'MacGuffins', 'simply', 'aid', 'propelling', 'ridiculous', 'rape', 'scene', 'author', 'responsibility', 'find', 'willfully', 'bad', 'writing', 'service', 'voyeuristic', 'anti-entertainment', 'just', 'context', 'like', 'films', 'Pedro', 'Almodovar', 'Alejandro', 'Jodorowsky', 'who', 'use', 'plenty', 'shocking', 'imagery', 'tableau', 'good', 'director', 'line', 'how', 'cross', 'Michael', 'Winterbottom', ""n't"", ""n't"", 'art.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'annoyed', 'rest', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'promising', 'excellent', 'qualities', 'core', 'messy', 'emotionally', 'dishonest', 'confessional', 'order', 'films', ""'Powder"", ""'Tideland"", ""'ve"", 'got', 'use', 'it.2', 'stars', 'world-design', 'excellent', 'soundtrack']",N/A

A convincing love story intertwined with an intelligent science fiction premise, &#34;Code 46&#34; can be viewed over and over without feeling contrived. At least, not in my opinion.

862358,AC62SNVRI158P,B00067BBMI,"traderje ""traderje""","[4, 6]","This movie is more like Blade Runner than Gattica. The difference is the overexposure and the lead getting jiggy with a clone instead of an android. Blade Runner also used the device of a global language combining English, Spanish, Mandarin and, etc., except done well. It sounded like a language where in Code 46 it was distracting and contrived. People just uttered an occasional word from other languages at random and they stood around mugging for the camera, ""did you hear that folks, I dropped a Spanish word.""Two points for the good side. 1st, I loved the location shooting. Good for the director for choosing real exotic locations instead of going the CGI route. The movie was almost worthwile for the location work.  2nd, and the other reviewers have not picked up on it so far, the ""cover"" referred to insurance coverage, they weren't just passports.

862359,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00067BBMI,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 4]","'Code 46' is the first sci-fi film from a very prolific British filmmaker Michael Winterbottom ('In This World' 'Jude' 'Butterfly Kiss' 'Go Now' 'The Claim' and so many others).  It features Samantha Morton (In America''Minority Report') and Tim Robbins ('Mystic River') who fall in love in the futuristic world where a certain kind of love is forbidden, and Code 46 represents that oppressive society.  (Oh, and don't forget to spot Mick Jones of one Brit punk rock group 'The Clash' ... just in case, see the karaoke scene.)The film's focus is, however, the realtions between a man and woman.  An investigator Willaim Geld (Robbins) arrives at Shanghai, where a forged passport is believed to be  manifuctured.  His job is to find the criminal, who must be in a company Sphinx Co., where Maria Gonzalez (Morton) works.  And William, married, falls in love with her, and sleeps with her.Months later, he comes back there, to find that Maria has changed.  The autority reluctantly explains that Maria has vilolated 'Code 46' and paid the penalty for that.  William, knowing the truths, tries to change her life, and his in consequence, in this bleak future world where technology dominates.First, I must say that as science fiction movie, there are much superior ones that share the same themes -- 'Gattaca' did it far better, and some might remember Terry Gillium's 'Brazil.'  To be fair, director Winterbottom succeeds in creating the unsettling feelings of dystopia by using great soundtracks and the existing buildings and landscapes (of Dubai, UAE; Shanghai, Hong Kong, and India) -- but if you want to see costly designs, this is not the place.So, the film brings the romantic relations between the officer and female worker to the forefront.  However, the relations between Robbins and Morton emit few, very few sparks.  Morton is just great, sometimes emotional, sometimes painful, always convincing, but Robbins is, I think, too restrained to express the forbidden love that should have burnt the screen.  The film's world looks very cold (which is OK), but when the love is described so bleakly, everything starts to be pointless.But the most damaging thing might be Winterbottom's way of filmmaking.  As I said before, he is very prolific, making one film every year.  But the sci-fi genre is a tricky one, which requires careful settings with a consistent tone (with or without gadgets).  But Winterbottoms shows the futuristic world too casually, even if it is done visually skillfully.  Many things are left unexplained, or if done, simply by a single notion like 'virus.'As a result, the 'love' between William and Maria looks too sudden, without sufficient time for them to generate the warm feelings to each other.  Samantha Morton nearly saves the film from its underwritten script, to be sure, and she is terrific as ever.  But as a whole 'Code 46' is a disappointment, not as a sci-fi film, which it is not; but as a 'Casablanca'-like love romance, which it nearly managed to be.",3,Sci-Fi Film? Not Exactly.

I had to watch this movie, not because I was interested this film, but it's because I am a die-hard Samantha Morton fan since Sweet And Lowdown. Quite fankly, I think this film is unique and interesting, but it's not well written and the two leads had no chemistry. I think Samantha was good when she was acting alone, but character is not captivating and fell flat most of the time. Also, it didn't make sense why Tim Robbins would risk punishment when he knew that to be involved sexually with Samantha was a violation of the Code 46, considered that he had a loving wife and son waiting at home for him. Is the future really going to be so complicted? There's memory erasal, gene cloning, and injection of virus to have languge skills and so on. Some of the sets and future technologies are impressive in this movie. Since this film is consisted of mostly conversations about forbidden love and identity, the 98 mins fell like more than 2 hours, and I actually couldn't wait for it to be over.
