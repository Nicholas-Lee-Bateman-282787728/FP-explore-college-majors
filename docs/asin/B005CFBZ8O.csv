They've released quite a few of these Midnight Horror Collections and, with all the ones that I've purchased, I hadn't been disappointed with one yet. Course, most of them that you see released on DVD are the more low-budget affairs. Those of you who read my reviews know that I heavily support lower budget filmmakers so that suits me just fine. Some of the finest movies I've ever seen and collected are low-budget movies(Puppetmaster, Subspecies, Demonic Toys, Deadfall Trail, Hell Comes to Frogtown, Phantasm, etc.).I took a chance getting this particular triple feature as I've never seen any of the Scarecrow movies, that I can recall, anyways. After viewing the three movies, I can honestly say that it was definitely a chance worth taking.Scarecrow tells the story of Lester Dwervick. An outcast amongst his peers at school.  Lester's mother is an alcoholic tramp who most often brings home drunken men from the local bars. One day, Lester picks a fight with one of his mother's boyfriends and is fatally attacked in their cornfield. Lester's lives on, however, as the scarecrow...and he's out to make his enemies pay.Scarecrow Slayer is about two fraternity pledges that head out to a cornfield to capture a scarecrow as part of their initiation. The boys search the rows for the scarecrow until one of them meets his maker in the form of the deadly straw stalker. Coming back as the scarecrow himself, he begins his violent rampage and boy, is there Hell to pay!Lastly, Scarecrow Gone Wild is about the mean-spirited captains of a college baseball team that take a group of underclassmen to a cornfield in the middle of the night. Expecting an initiation prank, what the young players get instead is a malicious scarecrow on an extremely violent rampage.I hope this ain't the last we see of this series. While they may be low-budget movies,they sure were entertaining and I want to see more. I heartily recommend this collection, it was pretty decent.",4,The Midnight Horror Collection:Scarecrow/Scarecrow Slayer/Scarecrow Gone Wild(Triple Feature).......,1340928000,"06 29, 2012",2012,2014,"['have', 'hand', 'Echo', 'Bridge', 'Home', 'Entertainment', ""'ve"", 'released', 'quite', 'few', 'Midnight', 'Horror', 'Collections', 'ones', ""'ve"", 'purchased', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'disappointed', 'one', 'yet', 'Course', 'most', 'see', 'released', 'DVD', 'are', 'more', 'low-budget', 'affairs', 'who', 'read', 'reviews', 'know', 'heavily', 'support', 'lower', 'budget', 'filmmakers', 'so', 'suits', 'just', 'fine', 'finest', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'collected', 'are', 'low-budget', 'movies', 'Puppetmaster', 'Subspecies', 'Demonic', 'Toys', 'Deadfall', 'Trail', 'Hell', 'Comes', 'Frogtown', 'Phantasm', 'etc', '.I', 'took', 'chance', 'getting', 'particular', 'triple', 'feature', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Scarecrow', 'movies', 'can', 'recall', 'anyways', 'viewing', 'three', 'movies', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'was', 'definitely', 'chance', 'worth', 'taking.Scarecrow', 'story', 'Lester', 'Dwervick', 'outcast', 'amongst', 'peers', 'school', 'Lester', 'mother', 'alcoholic', 'tramp', 'who', 'most', 'often', 'home', 'drunken', 'men', 'local', 'bars', 'One', 'day', 'Lester', 'fight', 'one', 'mother', 'boyfriends', 'fatally', 'attacked', 'cornfield', 'Lester', 'lives', 'however', 'scarecrow', 'out', 'make', 'enemies', 'pay.Scarecrow', 'Slayer', 'two', 'fraternity', 'pledges', 'head', 'cornfield', 'capture', 'scarecrow', 'part', 'initiation', 'boys', 'search', 'rows', 'scarecrow', 'one', 'maker', 'form', 'deadly', 'straw', 'stalker', 'Coming', 'back', 'scarecrow', 'violent', 'rampage', 'boy', 'there', 'Hell', 'pay', 'Lastly', 'Scarecrow', 'Gone', 'Wild', 'mean-spirited', 'captains', 'college', 'baseball', 'team', 'take', 'group', 'underclassmen', 'cornfield', 'middle', 'night', 'Expecting', 'initiation', 'prank', 'what', 'young', 'players', 'get', 'instead', 'malicious', 'scarecrow', 'extremely', 'violent', 'rampage.I', 'hope', 'ai', ""n't"", 'last', 'see', 'series', 'may', 'be', 'low-budget', 'movies', 'sure', 'were', 'entertaining', 'want', 'see', 'more', 'heartily', 'recommend', 'collection', 'was', 'pretty', 'decent']",Scarecrow / Scarecrow Slayer / Scarecrow Gone Wild

The Scarecrow made you feel sorry for the young boy and it was tragic what happened to him, but it is some consolation that he got the ones responsible. The Scarecrow Slayer was a little cheesy, but it was a fairly good movie. Scarecrow gone wild was a funny movie. It had a note of seriousness to it and as with all of the scarecrow movies you have a tendency to want to cheer for the scarecrow, because of the tragic circumstances behind his existence. I would recommend these movies. Some will enjoy them others not, but for me I thought they were pretty good.",4,Scarecrow triple feature,1367712000,"05 5, 2013",2013,602,"['scarecrow', 'movies', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'Scarecrow', 'made', 'feel', 'sorry', 'young', 'boy', 'was', 'tragic', 'what', 'happened', 'consolation', 'got', 'ones', 'responsible', 'Scarecrow', 'Slayer', 'was', 'little', 'cheesy', 'was', 'fairly', 'good', 'movie', 'Scarecrow', 'gone', 'wild', 'was', 'funny', 'movie', 'had', 'note', 'seriousness', 'scarecrow', 'movies', 'have', 'tendency', 'want', 'cheer', 'scarecrow', 'tragic', 'circumstances', 'existence', 'would', 'recommend', 'movies', 'will', 'enjoy', 'others', 'not', 'thought', 'were', 'pretty', 'good']",Scarecrow / Scarecrow Slayer / Scarecrow Gone Wild
