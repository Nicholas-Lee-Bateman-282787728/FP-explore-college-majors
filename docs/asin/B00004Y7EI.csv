558478,A4R9MJFF8UFND,B00004Y7EI,Brian Camp,"[4, 4]","THE HOT, THE COOL AND THE VICIOUS (1976) has a much more complicated plotline than the average kung fu movie and boasts some intriguing touches not often found in the genre. Packed with incident, it's a skillful blend of police drama and western as it focuses on a small town security chief (and Northern Leg expert) and his efforts to arrest the son of the town boss, all while keeping an eye on a notorious killer (and Southern Fist fighter) who's arrived in town on a mystery mission. Eventually the town boss's partner in crime, the albino Mr. Lung, returns for the inevitable showdown.Captain Lu, the Northern Leg expert, is played by Tan Tao Liang. The Southern Fist fighter is played by Wong Tao. After initial antagonism, the two team up to combat town boss Yuen (George Wang) and the blond-tressed Mr. Lung (played by the film's fight choreographer Tommy Lee). Also in the cast are three striking actresses, one of whom (Sun Chia Lin) plays a woman seeking revenge on Captain Lu and attacks him with weapons at various points.The film's dizzying narrative is interspersed with fast and frequent kung fu bouts, one of which takes place in a deserted ghost town. Tan demonstrates his amazing leg power with satisfying regularity. Wong Tao fights well but also has dark matinee idol looks, sort of in the mold of Hollywood golden era swashbuckling star Tyrone Power. His character is something of a womanizer, a rare quirk for a kung fu hero. The film's stars and director (Lee Tso Nam) reunited for the similarly styled CHALLENGE OF DEATH (1978).",3,Well-mounted kung fu film in the style of a western,1006646400,"11 25, 2001",2001,1553,"['HOT', 'THE', 'COOL', 'AND', 'THE', 'VICIOUS', '1976', 'much', 'more', 'complicated', 'plotline', 'average', 'kung', 'fu', 'movie', 'intriguing', 'touches', 'not', 'often', 'found', 'genre', 'Packed', 'incident', 'skillful', 'blend', 'police', 'drama', 'western', 'small', 'town', 'security', 'chief', 'Northern', 'Leg', 'expert', 'efforts', 'arrest', 'son', 'town', 'boss', 'keeping', 'eye', 'notorious', 'killer', 'Southern', 'Fist', 'fighter', 'who', 'arrived', 'town', 'mystery', 'mission', 'Eventually', 'town', 'boss', 'partner', 'crime', 'albino', 'Mr', 'Lung', 'inevitable', 'showdown.Captain', 'Lu', 'Northern', 'Leg', 'expert', 'played', 'Tan', 'Tao', 'Liang', 'Southern', 'Fist', 'fighter', 'played', 'Wong', 'Tao', 'initial', 'antagonism', 'two', 'team', 'up', 'combat', 'town', 'boss', 'Yuen', 'George', 'Wang', 'blond-tressed', 'Mr', 'Lung', 'played', 'film', 'fight', 'choreographer', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Also', 'cast', 'are', 'three', 'striking', 'actresses', 'one', 'whom', 'Sun', 'Chia', 'Lin', 'woman', 'seeking', 'revenge', 'Captain', 'Lu', 'weapons', 'various', 'points.The', 'film', 'dizzying', 'narrative', 'interspersed', 'fast', 'frequent', 'kung', 'fu', 'bouts', 'one', 'place', 'deserted', 'ghost', 'town', 'Tan', 'amazing', 'leg', 'power', 'satisfying', 'regularity', 'Wong', 'Tao', 'fights', 'well', 'also', 'dark', 'matinee', 'idol', 'sort', 'mold', 'Hollywood', 'golden', 'era', 'swashbuckling', 'star', 'Tyrone', 'Power', 'character', 'something', 'womanizer', 'rare', 'quirk', 'kung', 'fu', 'hero', 'film', 'stars', 'director', 'Lee', 'Tso', 'Nam', 'reunited', 'similarly', 'styled', 'CHALLENGE', 'OF', 'DEATH', '1978']","Hot, Cool and Vicious"

558480,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00004Y7EI,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[2, 4]","Yes, it's Asian martial arts action with a touch of the Old West (American spaghetti westerns) when the gang from The Hot, the Cool, and the Vicious get together.  I'm not sure who was hot, who was cool, and who was vicious, but this is by no means a bad film.  It actually manages to follow two converging storylines without making a confusing mess of things, and the true motivations of a couple of characters are hard to judge for the film's first hour or so.  I wasn't overly impressed with much of the kung fu action, I'll admit; there's a great emphasis on kicking (and, at least in the case of martial arts fighting, I'm not a legs man), and I felt that all of the early fights seemed a little too choreographed - the moves are all there, but the intensity is lacking.  The action is taken up another notch in the concluding fight sequences, but by then I was facing an even bigger problem with the film.Things were going along quite well, and then a character named Mr. Lung (Tommy Lee) showed up out of nowhere.  I don't care how good a fighter he is, the man looks quite ridiculous, sporting blonde hair and a face covered with enough white makeup to last a geisha girl for a whole month.  To make things worse, he possesses unnatural skills (suddenly pulling a well-made rug of reality right out from under the story), and his voice, at least in the dubbed version, is given a wicked little echo that was probably supposed to impress me - it didn't impress me at all because it sounded ridiculous.  Then there is the fact that the guy hobbles around with a noticeable limp, but when he starts fighting he's Jack B. Nimble.  Mr. Lung pretty much ruined this movie for me.What about the spaghetti western aspects of the film, you ask?  They are certainly not all-pervasive, but they are there.  You start out in a saloon-type establishment, featuring special &quot;entertainment,&quot; complete with a sassy little woman running the place.  When the town's chief of security first appears, you see his feet stop just before he throws open the doors of the bar and comes in - very much in the mold of the standard Western good guy entrance.  Naturally, you have your barroom brawl thrown into the mix, the introduction of some horses to the action, and a few other little things - just enough to be interesting, really.I consider The Hot, the Cool, and the Vicious an average martial arts film; it could have been better, but it also could have been much, much worse.

558484,A3J3XO9BNTVTRS,B00004Y7EI,YhwhKhai,"[1, 3]","This was an okay Kung Fu flick.  Some of the fighting scenes kind of lame and predictable!  Plot was also predictable right up to the end.  Acting not bad - seen better in other Kung Fu films. DVD crossover could have been a bit better though. I can't stand that ""Ocean Shores"" name and logo that seem to pop up in the middle of the screen and stays there until you begin to get sick of looking at it.The villan, Tommy Lee (I think this is his name), looked like total CRAP! This bum just comes out of nowhere. That old drunk in Drunken Master looked better than he did and he was paid to look drunk!!!!!! What was Tommy's excuse? Yea, what's up with the white ghost face overdone makeup?  He looked like uneven chalk marks was smacked across his face.  Also, what's up with that fake echo projected voice?  His overdubs totally SUCKED!!!!!!!!!!! That, in my opinion made him look and sound more like a real idiot than a true villan.  This flick could have went on normally without him having the fake limp added to his already shabby appearance  - his limp did not show up at all while he was fighting.  What was the limp all about anyway? And that hump in his back? Come on! Seriously guys, I can deal with the jumping off and onto three-story rooftops and some of the bad wig jobs, but overall, I'm happy that the ghostface killer in ""Ninja Checkmate"" didn't look like this bum!This is no where near a 5 star-rated film and giving it a 3 perhaps might be too generous.
