970195,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,B000E8JNQA,Annie Van Auken,"[2, 3]","Of the six DVDs inTHE SHAW COLLECTION, this one by far is my favorite. Yes Ian Richardson and Patrick Stewart are excellent in the BBC Theatre Night production of THE DEVIL'S DISCIPLE (UK/Canada-1987), but the show absolutely belongs to Mike Gwilym as the title character, an insouciant fellow who always speaks his mind, no matter who is hurt along the way.Gwilym had a minor role in the Walter Matthau/Glenda Jackson comedyHOPSCOTCH(1980). His small cinematic resum&eacute; is no indication of the man's abilities. Close your eyes when Gwilym speaks and you hear Richard Burton's tone and accent. Both were born just miles apart in southern Wales, which explains it. Gwilym has the same star power as the Welsh actor a quarter-century his senior. His rendering here of 'Dck' Dudgeon's transformation under the most trying of circumstances from town pariah to local hero is spot on.Shaw's scripting of Dudgeon's fearlessly aggressive attitude while facing the gallows is consistent with the character's earlier behavior. It's truly a star role capably handled, thus in this version of Shaw's American Revolution-set drama, Mike Gwilym is the one to watch!Equally delightful is the bonus feature, THE WIT AND WORLD OF GEORGE BERNARD SHAW (TV-Canada/UK-1972). Written, produced and directed by Canadian documentarian Harry Rasky, this program is narrated by and stars Christopher Plummer. He visits GBS's birthplace and spends much time in the home where Shaw died of advanced old age in 1950. Plummer also reads from GB's library and performs a bit of MAN AND SUPERMAN. Four other actors contribute scenes, including Genevi&egrave;ve Bujold asSAINT JOAN(set in a modern prison).An amusing highlight is ""A Little Bit of Luck"" fromMY FAIR LADY, done in Japanese by a Tokyo theatrical company. Plummer demonstrates his considerable pianistic skills, playing the writer's own instrument. Shaw himself is given opportunity to speak on several occasions, and his unique thoughts close out this 54 minute show, one that should be seen by all fans of the great playwright.NOTE: Harry Rasky is also responsible for the excellent 80 minute documentary,TENNESSEE WILLIAMS' SOUTH(Canada-1972). Highlights include interviews with Williams, plus Jessica Tandy's recreation of a Blanche DuBois scene that was severely censored in Elia Kazan's 1951 film ofA STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE.",5,"Shaw speaks, plus one of his better plays",1292112000,"12 12, 2010",2010,2365,"['six', 'DVDs', 'inTHE', 'SHAW', 'COLLECTION', 'one', 'far', 'favorite', 'Yes', 'Ian', 'Richardson', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'are', 'excellent', 'BBC', 'Theatre', 'Night', 'production', 'THE', 'DEVIL', 'DISCIPLE', 'UK/Canada-1987', 'show', 'absolutely', 'Mike', 'Gwilym', 'title', 'character', 'insouciant', 'fellow', 'who', 'always', 'mind', 'matter', 'who', 'hurt', 'way.Gwilym', 'had', 'minor', 'role', 'Walter', 'Matthau/Glenda', 'Jackson', 'comedyHOPSCOTCH', '1980', 'small', 'cinematic', 'resum', 'eacute', 'indication', 'man', 'abilities', 'Close', 'eyes', 'when', 'Gwilym', 'hear', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'tone', 'accent', 'were', 'born', 'just', 'miles', 'apart', 'southern', 'Wales', 'Gwilym', 'same', 'star', 'power', 'Welsh', 'actor', 'quarter-century', 'senior', 'rendering', 'here', ""'Dck"", 'Dudgeon', 'transformation', 'most', 'trying', 'circumstances', 'town', 'pariah', 'local', 'hero', 'spot', 'on.Shaw', 'scripting', 'Dudgeon', 'fearlessly', 'aggressive', 'attitude', 'facing', 'gallows', 'consistent', 'character', 'earlier', 'behavior', 'truly', 'star', 'role', 'capably', 'handled', 'thus', 'version', 'Shaw', 'American', 'Revolution-set', 'drama', 'Mike', 'Gwilym', 'one', 'watch', 'Equally', 'delightful', 'bonus', 'feature', 'THE', 'WIT', 'AND', 'WORLD', 'OF', 'GEORGE', 'BERNARD', 'SHAW', 'TV-Canada/UK-1972', 'Written', 'produced', 'directed', 'Canadian', 'documentarian', 'Harry', 'Rasky', 'program', 'narrated', 'stars', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'GBS', 'birthplace', 'much', 'time', 'home', 'where', 'Shaw', 'died', 'advanced', 'old', 'age', '1950', 'Plummer', 'also', 'GB', 'library', 'bit', 'MAN', 'AND', 'SUPERMAN', 'Four', 'other', 'actors', 'contribute', 'scenes', 'including', 'Genevi', 'egrave', 'Bujold', 'asSAINT', 'JOAN', 'set', 'modern', 'prison', 'amusing', 'highlight', 'A', 'Little', 'Bit', 'Luck', 'fromMY', 'FAIR', 'LADY', 'done', 'Japanese', 'Tokyo', 'theatrical', 'company', 'Plummer', 'considerable', 'pianistic', 'skills', 'playing', 'writer', 'own', 'instrument', 'Shaw', 'given', 'opportunity', 'speak', 'several', 'occasions', 'unique', 'thoughts', 'close', '54', 'minute', 'show', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'fans', 'great', 'playwright.NOTE', 'Harry', 'Rasky', 'also', 'responsible', 'excellent', '80', 'minute', 'documentary', 'TENNESSEE', 'WILLIAMS', 'SOUTH', 'Canada-1972', 'include', 'interviews', 'Williams', 'Jessica', 'Tandy', 'recreation', 'Blanche', 'DuBois', 'scene', 'was', 'severely', 'censored', 'Elia', 'Kazan', '1951', 'film', 'ofA', 'STREETCAR', 'NAMED', 'DESIRE']",N/A

970197,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B000E8JNQA,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[1, 3]","George Bernard Shaw wrote it, and some very brilliant BBC actors performed it. One such is my beloved Patrick Stewart, who plays Anthony Anderson, the Presbyterian minister in a small town during the American revolution. The self-proclaimed Devil's Disciple is young Dick Dudgeon (Mike Gwilym), who returned home for the reading of his father's will and faced the scorn of his ostentatiously pious mother.The British have just hanged his uncle for a rebel, and his mother has taken in her brother-in-law's ""natural child,"" whom she treats very like a slave. His father died in an inn away from home, and the minister was there when he changed his will to leave most of his estate to Richard, who has been away from home being a ne'er do well and a smuggler.Minister Anderson is polite to Dick, even when his own family is not. He invites him to his house, even though his wife Judith (Susan Woolridge) strongly disapproves of him. They are about to have tea when the minister is called away to Dick's mother's bedside, but Dick was not called for and does not want to go along. So Rev. Anderson asks his wife to serve Dick his tea and keep him there until he returns.Dick was just commenting on the fact that a stranger who walked in would take them for husband and wife when a stranger does indeed walk in: a British soldier who has been ordered to arrest Rev. Anderson. The soldier assumes Dick is the minister, and he allows the mistaken identity in the hopes that the minister will escape.I don't think I've told you too much: this is all in the first 10 or 15 minutes. What happens from that point gradually reveals the true character of Richard Dudgeon, the Devil's Disciple, and also of Judith Anderson and, finally, of Anthony Anderson as well.One odd note: the minute the General arrived and was called Burgoyne, I knew what would happen. There is a famous quilt pattern called ""Burgoyne Surrounded,"" so it was all quite obvious as to his place in history. The rest is an often witty and generally quite entertaining story in the best tradition of Shaw.",4,Not Really About Devil Worship,1336694400,"05 11, 2012",2012,2062,"['George', 'Bernard', 'Shaw', 'wrote', 'very', 'brilliant', 'BBC', 'actors', 'performed', 'One', 'such', 'beloved', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'who', 'Anthony', 'Anderson', 'Presbyterian', 'minister', 'small', 'town', 'American', 'revolution', 'self-proclaimed', 'Devil', 'Disciple', 'young', 'Dick', 'Dudgeon', 'Mike', 'Gwilym', 'who', 'returned', 'home', 'reading', 'father', 'will', 'faced', 'scorn', 'ostentatiously', 'pious', 'mother.The', 'British', 'have', 'just', 'hanged', 'uncle', 'rebel', 'mother', 'taken', 'brother-in-law', 'natural', 'child', 'whom', 'very', 'slave', 'father', 'died', 'inn', 'away', 'home', 'minister', 'was', 'there', 'when', 'changed', 'will', 'leave', 'most', 'estate', 'Richard', 'who', 'been', 'away', 'home', 'being', ""ne'er"", 'do', 'well', 'smuggler.Minister', 'Anderson', 'polite', 'Dick', 'even', 'when', 'own', 'family', 'not', 'house', 'even', 'wife', 'Judith', 'Susan', 'Woolridge', 'strongly', 'are', 'have', 'tea', 'when', 'minister', 'called', 'away', 'Dick', 'mother', 'bedside', 'Dick', 'was', 'not', 'called', 'not', 'want', 'go', 'along', 'So', 'Rev', 'Anderson', 'wife', 'serve', 'Dick', 'tea', 'keep', 'there', 'returns.Dick', 'was', 'just', 'commenting', 'fact', 'stranger', 'who', 'walked', 'would', 'take', 'husband', 'wife', 'when', 'stranger', 'indeed', 'walk', 'British', 'soldier', 'who', 'been', 'ordered', 'arrest', 'Rev', 'Anderson', 'soldier', 'assumes', 'Dick', 'minister', 'mistaken', 'identity', 'hopes', 'minister', 'will', 'escape.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ve"", 'told', 'too', 'much', 'first', '10', '15', 'minutes', 'What', 'point', 'gradually', 'true', 'character', 'Richard', 'Dudgeon', 'Devil', 'Disciple', 'also', 'Judith', 'Anderson', 'finally', 'Anthony', 'Anderson', 'well.One', 'odd', 'note', 'minute', 'General', 'arrived', 'was', 'called', 'Burgoyne', 'knew', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'famous', 'quilt', 'pattern', 'called', 'Burgoyne', 'Surrounded', 'was', 'quite', 'obvious', 'place', 'history', 'rest', 'often', 'witty', 'generally', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'story', 'best', 'tradition', 'Shaw']",N/A

970201,A1C58YXM2A30CY,B000E8JNQA,"Scotman's Film & Book Reviews ""Film & Book Re...","[3, 4]","With a title like 'Devil's Disciple' I was expecting some kind of Satan worship or something.  What I got was far different and far more interesting.It's the American Revolution, 1777, as British general Burgoyne comes down from the north, hanging potential leaders to quell rebellion.  One such unlucky fellow is the uncle of one Dick Dudgeon (Mike Gwilym) is the ""devil's disciple,"" self-proclaimed.At about the same time as the passing of his uncle by the British rope, Dick comes back home to his mother and family as they await the reading of the will of his recently deceased father.  To everyone's surprise, Dick is given most of the money and property.  His mother hates her son, curses him but she has no power over him now that the will has been deemed valid.Despite these things, Dick is a happy guy and seems to delight in being the foil to the Puritan ideals of the townsfolk.To throw off the yolk of British imperialism though, it will take certain people to speak out for freedom and Burgoyne's campaign of death is doing its job -- anyone outspoken enough will be hanged.We also meet the minister (Tony Anderson) of the village, well-played by Patrick Stewart (of Star Trek fame).  His eloquent speech and manner are that of a minister -- forgiving, and a solid foundation of faith.Dick confronts him and also declares he himself is as solid in his foundation of the devil as the minister is of his faith.The story takes a major turn when the minister leaves his wife and house on an errand, leaving Dick with the minister's wife.  Just then, the Redcoats come in and arrest who they think is the minister.  Pretending to be the minister, both Dick and the wife (Judith) let the Brits be fooled.Trouble is, looks like Dick will be hanged!  The further story of the trial, of Judith's hatred and then 180 degree turn of emotion is compelling.  Also Gentlemen Johnny (nickname for Burgoyne) realizes that his days are possibly numbered, as Patrick Stewart comes riding to the rescue.Inventive, and clearly a sarcastic interpretation of relations between not only men or women, but that agnostics also have a faith of sorts -- and we all have faith in freedom -- and perhaps that's the real upshot of Americans -- their renewed sense of purpose and freedom rather than the Brit's purpose (in the film at least) of maintaining a status quo.I have not seen the old version from the Sixties, but this 1987 BBC production is a must-see for sure.  The sets were made as if with a play or theater in mind (G. Bernard Shaw being a playwright, this is not surprising) -- painted backdrop, accurate historical costumes as well as in the context of the historical battle that was about to play out with Gentlemen Johnny.Recommended!",5,BBC America Production -- Fascinatingly Historic!,1278720000,"07 10, 2010",2010,2735,"['title', ""'Devil"", 'Disciple', 'was', 'expecting', 'kind', 'Satan', 'worship', 'something', 'What', 'got', 'was', 'far', 'different', 'far', 'more', 'interesting.It', 'American', 'Revolution', '1777', 'British', 'general', 'Burgoyne', 'down', 'north', 'hanging', 'potential', 'leaders', 'quell', 'rebellion', 'One', 'such', 'unlucky', 'fellow', 'uncle', 'one', 'Dick', 'Dudgeon', 'Mike', 'Gwilym', 'devil', 'disciple', 'self-proclaimed.At', 'same', 'time', 'passing', 'uncle', 'British', 'rope', 'Dick', 'back', 'home', 'mother', 'family', 'await', 'reading', 'will', 'recently', 'deceased', 'father', 'everyone', 'surprise', 'Dick', 'given', 'most', 'money', 'property', 'mother', 'son', 'power', 'now', 'will', 'been', 'deemed', 'things', 'Dick', 'happy', 'guy', 'delight', 'being', 'foil', 'Puritan', 'ideals', 'townsfolk.To', 'throw', 'off', 'yolk', 'British', 'imperialism', 'will', 'take', 'certain', 'people', 'speak', 'out', 'freedom', 'Burgoyne', 'campaign', 'death', 'doing', 'job', 'anyone', 'outspoken', 'enough', 'will', 'be', 'hanged.We', 'also', 'meet', 'minister', 'Tony', 'Anderson', 'village', 'well-played', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'Star', 'Trek', 'fame', 'eloquent', 'speech', 'manner', 'are', 'minister', 'forgiving', 'solid', 'foundation', 'faith.Dick', 'confronts', 'also', 'solid', 'foundation', 'devil', 'minister', 'faith.The', 'story', 'major', 'turn', 'when', 'minister', 'wife', 'house', 'errand', 'leaving', 'Dick', 'minister', 'wife', 'Just', 'then', 'Redcoats', 'come', 'arrest', 'who', 'think', 'minister', 'Pretending', 'be', 'minister', 'Dick', 'wife', 'Judith', 'let', 'Brits', 'be', 'fooled.Trouble', 'Dick', 'will', 'be', 'hanged', 'further', 'story', 'trial', 'Judith', 'hatred', 'then', '180', 'degree', 'turn', 'emotion', 'compelling', 'Also', 'Gentlemen', 'Johnny', 'nickname', 'Burgoyne', 'days', 'are', 'possibly', 'numbered', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'riding', 'rescue.Inventive', 'clearly', 'sarcastic', 'interpretation', 'relations', 'not', 'only', 'men', 'women', 'agnostics', 'also', 'have', 'faith', 'sorts', 'have', 'faith', 'freedom', 'perhaps', 'real', 'upshot', 'Americans', 'renewed', 'sense', 'purpose', 'freedom', 'rather', 'Brit', 'purpose', 'film', 'least', 'maintaining', 'status', 'quo.I', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'old', 'version', 'Sixties', '1987', 'BBC', 'production', 'must-see', 'sure', 'sets', 'were', 'made', 'play', 'theater', 'mind', 'G.', 'Bernard', 'Shaw', 'being', 'playwright', 'not', 'surprising', 'painted', 'backdrop', 'accurate', 'historical', 'costumes', 'as', 'well', 'context', 'historical', 'battle', 'was', 'play', 'out', 'Gentlemen', 'Johnny.Recommended']",N/A
