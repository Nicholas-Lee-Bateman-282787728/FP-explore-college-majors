These set of videos featuring the sixth Doctor (Colin Baker) and Peri (Nicola Bryant) comprise 4 seperate stories under  the umbrella of an ongoing courtroom drama with the Doctor on trial for his  general mucking about in the space time continuum.'The Mysterious  Planet' is a four part story which introduces us to Glitz, a great fun  rogue trader who pops up again in 'Dragonfire.' It's probably the worst  story but still good. 'Mindwarp' is another 4 part story - a sequel to  'Vengence on Varos' with some of the best incidental music written for the  series.'Terror of the Vervoids' changes tack becoming the 'Murder on the  Orient Express' of the season but introduces us to Mel aka Bonnie Langford.  Peri was much nicer.The final 2 episodes (much like 'The War Games') are  the pay off. The Doctor's fights his new adversary, the Valeyard and a  familiar one from the past.

Hamlow,"[10, 11]","For the first time since the Key Of Time, an entire season was dedicated in an umbrella theme consisting of multiple stories, and put together, Trial Of A Timelord is a lengthy 14 episodes.  There's a borrowing from Charles Dickens' Christmas Carol and the three ghosts.  Like them, the first three stories are looks at the Doctor's past, present, and future.&quot;The Mysterious Planet&quot;:  After an impressive computer graphics shot of a space station and a tractor beam drawing the TARDIS into a docking bay, the Doctor finds he is on trial for interfering in the affairs of other people and planets.  The Valeyard (pron. vallyard), a title meaning Learned Court Prosecutor, presents as his first evidence the Doctor and Peri's trip to Ravalox, a planet once destroyed by a fireball that reminds Peri of Earth.  Not only that but it has the same period of rotation, angular tilt and period of rotation as Earth.  Well, guess what?  It IS Earth, but what's it doing light years away from its home constellation?  He also runs into a mercenary, Sabalom Glitz, who's interested in certain technological secrets the planet's undercity habitat contains, as well as the subterranean society.  However, some portions of evidence are bleeped out, arousing the Doctor's suspicions.The second part, &quot;Mindwarp,&quot; is a trip to Thoros-Beta, where the Doctor and Peri run into that avaricious capitalist slug, Sil, from Vengeance From Varos, and his boss Kiv, whose powerful brain makes him his planet's financial wizard, but he is a hybrid mutation among his race, and his brain is expanding within a skull that lacks elasticity.  Unless something is done by neurosurgeon Crozier, he will die, and if he dies, both Crozier and Sil will be executed.  The Doctor is quite the Judas here, undergoing a personality change by helping Sil and Crozier, and abandoning and betraying Peri, who is mostly in the company of Yrcarnos, a bombastic warrior king who feels his destiny is to liberate the slaves of Thoros-Beta from the Mentors.  Many of these slaves have been subject to Doctor Moreau-like experiments, including Dorf, Yrcarnos's equerry.  In the courtroom, the Doctor has suspicions about the Valeyard's presentation from the Matrix.  Yes, the events took place, but with the emphasis all wrong, something the Valeyard dismisses.  But the ending is a shocker that really sobers the usually emotional Sixth Doctor.My favourite part is &quot;Terror Of The Vervoids,&quot; a variation on Agatha Christie's Ten Little Indians.  The Doctor's piece of evidence comes from his future, where he is in the company of a petite bubbly redhead, Melanie, who's got him on the fitness wagon.  However, they answer a mayday from the Hyperion III, &quot;an intergalactic liner that ferries between Mogar and Earth, a scheduled flight in the Earth year 2986.  ... Many [people] will never complete the journey, for in order to protect a secret hidden in the space liner, one will become a murderer.&quot;  Is it the masked Mogarians, disgruntled at Earth's exploiting their mineral wealth?  Is it Lasky, the agronomist who's conducting a mysterious experiment involving some gigantic pods in the hydroponic center?  Here, the Doctor is certain the Matrix has been tampered with, and that the truth is being distorted.  He does prove his case, but he doesn't reckon on the Valeyard's cunning.The whole thing is wrapped up with Mel and Glitz returning to testify on the Doctor's behalf, and revelations disclosed in the last two episodes, &quot;The Ultimate Foe,&quot; where yes, the Master comes out, but he isn't the title character, oh no.  The Doctor has another journey in the Matrix, but it's not as impressive as in The Deadly Assassin.The ratings were disastrous, but this is actually a wonderfully-executed idea.  The stories are intercut with scenes in the trial room, mainly consisting of the Doctor's emotional outbursts against the Valeyard's condemning accusations, tempered by the Inquisitor trying to keep order and to get to the truth.  With guest stars like Honor Blackman, Tony Selby, Joan Sims, Lynda Bellingham, and Gordon Warnecke, it shouldn't have failed.  But then there was worse news mixed with good.  Yes, the series got an extended lease on life, but not Colin Baker.  On 18 December 1986, he was unceremoniously given the push, making the way for Sylvester McCoy as the Seventh Doctor.",4,"An underrated, unjustly maligned story and Doctor",1078272000,"03 3, 2004",2004,4400,"['first', 'time', 'Key', 'Time', 'entire', 'season', 'was', 'dedicated', 'umbrella', 'theme', 'consisting', 'multiple', 'stories', 'put', 'together', 'Trial', 'A', 'Timelord', 'lengthy', '14', 'episodes', 'borrowing', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'three', 'ghosts', 'first', 'three', 'stories', 'are', 'Doctor', 'past', 'present', 'future.', 'quot', 'Mysterious', 'Planet', 'quot', 'impressive', 'computer', 'graphics', 'shot', 'space', 'station', 'tractor', 'beam', 'drawing', 'TARDIS', 'docking', 'bay', 'Doctor', 'trial', 'interfering', 'affairs', 'other', 'people', 'planets', 'Valeyard', 'pron', 'vallyard', 'title', 'meaning', 'Learned', 'Court', 'Prosecutor', 'first', 'evidence', 'Doctor', 'Peri', 'trip', 'Ravalox', 'planet', 'once', 'destroyed', 'fireball', 'Peri', 'Earth', 'Not', 'only', 'same', 'period', 'rotation', 'angular', 'tilt', 'period', 'rotation', 'Earth', 'Well', 'guess', 'what', 'Earth', 'what', 'doing', 'light', 'years', 'away', 'home', 'constellation', 'also', 'mercenary', 'Sabalom', 'Glitz', 'who', 'interested', 'certain', 'technological', 'secrets', 'planet', 'undercity', 'habitat', 'contains', 'as', 'well', 'subterranean', 'society', 'However', 'portions', 'evidence', 'are', 'bleeped', 'out', 'arousing', 'Doctor', 'suspicions.The', 'second', 'part', 'quot', 'Mindwarp', 'quot', 'trip', 'Thoros-Beta', 'where', 'Doctor', 'Peri', 'run', 'avaricious', 'capitalist', 'slug', 'Sil', 'Vengeance', 'From', 'Varos', 'boss', 'Kiv', 'powerful', 'brain', 'planet', 'financial', 'wizard', 'hybrid', 'mutation', 'race', 'brain', 'expanding', 'skull', 'elasticity', 'something', 'done', 'neurosurgeon', 'Crozier', 'will', 'die', 'Crozier', 'Sil', 'will', 'be', 'executed', 'Doctor', 'quite', 'Judas', 'here', 'undergoing', 'personality', 'change', 'helping', 'Sil', 'Crozier', 'abandoning', 'betraying', 'Peri', 'who', 'mostly', 'company', 'Yrcarnos', 'bombastic', 'warrior', 'king', 'who', 'destiny', 'liberate', 'slaves', 'Thoros-Beta', 'Mentors', 'Many', 'slaves', 'have', 'been', 'subject', 'Doctor', 'Moreau-like', 'experiments', 'including', 'Dorf', 'Yrcarnos', 'equerry', 'courtroom', 'Doctor', 'suspicions', 'Valeyard', 'presentation', 'Matrix', 'Yes', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'emphasis', 'wrong', 'something', 'Valeyard', 'ending', 'shocker', 'really', 'usually', 'emotional', 'Sixth', 'Doctor.My', 'favourite', 'part', 'quot', 'Terror', 'Vervoids', 'quot', 'variation', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'Ten', 'Little', 'Indians', 'Doctor', 'piece', 'evidence', 'future', 'where', 'company', 'petite', 'bubbly', 'redhead', 'Melanie', 'who', 'got', 'fitness', 'wagon', 'However', 'answer', 'mayday', 'Hyperion', 'III', 'quot', 'intergalactic', 'liner', 'Mogar', 'Earth', 'scheduled', 'flight', 'Earth', 'year', '2986', 'Many', '[', 'people', ']', 'will', 'never', 'complete', 'journey', 'order', 'protect', 'secret', 'hidden', 'space', 'liner', 'one', 'will', 'become', 'murderer.', 'quot', 'masked', 'Mogarians', 'disgruntled', 'Earth', 'exploiting', 'mineral', 'wealth', 'Lasky', 'agronomist', 'who', 'conducting', 'mysterious', 'experiment', 'involving', 'gigantic', 'pods', 'hydroponic', 'center', 'Here', 'Doctor', 'certain', 'Matrix', 'been', 'tampered', 'truth', 'being', 'distorted', 'prove', 'case', ""n't"", 'reckon', 'Valeyard', 'cunning.The', 'whole', 'thing', 'wrapped', 'up', 'Mel', 'Glitz', 'returning', 'testify', 'Doctor', 'behalf', 'revelations', 'disclosed', 'last', 'two', 'episodes', 'quot', 'Ultimate', 'Foe', 'quot', 'where', 'yes', 'Master', 'out', ""n't"", 'title', 'character', 'oh', 'Doctor', 'journey', 'Matrix', 'not', 'as', 'impressive', 'Deadly', 'Assassin.The', 'ratings', 'were', 'disastrous', 'actually', 'wonderfully-executed', 'idea', 'stories', 'are', 'intercut', 'scenes', 'trial', 'room', 'mainly', 'consisting', 'Doctor', 'emotional', 'outbursts', 'Valeyard', 'condemning', 'accusations', 'tempered', 'Inquisitor', 'trying', 'keep', 'order', 'get', 'truth', 'guest', 'stars', 'Honor', 'Blackman', 'Tony', 'Selby', 'Joan', 'Sims', 'Lynda', 'Bellingham', 'Gordon', 'Warnecke', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'failed', 'then', 'was', 'worse', 'news', 'mixed', 'good', 'Yes', 'series', 'got', 'extended', 'lease', 'life', 'not', 'Colin', 'Baker', '18', 'December', '1986', 'was', 'unceremoniously', 'given', 'push', 'making', 'way', 'Sylvester', 'McCoy', 'Seventh', 'Doctor']",N/A
344012,AKJOWY6V1EJPJ,6302884969,G.Spider,"[7, 8]","The Doctor is taken from his adventures to stand trial for interfering with the affairs of others (in what is undoubtedly the most visually fantastic opening scene of any Dr Who story).  In a nod towards 'A  Christmas Carol', the evidence takes place in the form of events from the  past, present and future.What that means is that the Doctor watches  three of his adventures.  The first is set on a planet populated by  primatives and underground scientists.  This story is noteworthy for  introducing cosmic dodgy-dealer Glitz, who ought to have returned for more  Dr Who stories than he did. The second adventure includes the return of  Sil, but unfortunately he is all too often used for comic relief.  Brian  Blessed plays a character similar to his King Richard the 4th in 'The Black  Adder'.  Whilst this was fine for a comedy show, it is a little out of  place in serious drama, and overall the story is too thin to span four  episodes. The third adventure, despite introducing the most loathed  companion in the series to date, is solid entertainment, a truly inspired  whodunnit, and as a bonus the increasingly irritating courtroom  interuptions are kept to a minimum. The final two episodes contrast in  style.  The first is genuinely gripping and contains some marvellous  surrealism.  It's a shame Robert Holmes (the series' greatest writer) never  lived to finish his contribution to this story.  Pip and Jake Baker's  episode is far too campy and totally undermines the atmosphere built up in  the previous episode.But, minor gripes aside, 'Trial of a Time Lord' is  a classic.  The Valeyard is memorably sinister, the music is at its best  and there is a lot of entertainment to be had.  It's a shame that Colin  Baker's era was cut short as it's easy to see the way his Doctor's  character is developing into a more likeable, moral figure in these  episodes.

344013,A2XWBYHQY5MG9,6302884969,Ian D. Smith,"[7, 8]","(expanded upon an earlier anonymous review)Colin Baker is by far the most under-rated of all the actors who played the Doctor. His tenure was brief and at times controversial, his portrayal of the Doctor is still argued about to this day, both his companions were maligned, his stories were often criticized and Doctor Who itself underwent a serious revamping during his reign. But much of all that criticism is not entirely accurate nor fair. While the majority of his Season 22 stories make far better indications of just how enjoyable Doctor Who really was with Colin, &quot;The Trial of a Time Lord&quot; is actually a perfect indicator of what was good and bad in his era.The overall atmosphere of this epic 14-parter is light and at times flippant. In stark contrast to the violence of Season 22 and the pronounced instability of the Doctor himself, this story starts out brightly and (gasp!) the Doctor and his companion Peri actually seem to like each other. The first 4 episodes, (&quot;The Mysterious Planet&quot;) are unfortunately not the best work of DW's esteemed writer Robert Holmes. The story is weak and quite a bit of the dialogue is poor. But as usual, Holmes does manage to save some great lines and characterizations for the regulars and for two new creations - the slimy criminals Glitz and Dibber. Sabalom Glitz (played by Tony Selby) is in fact one of the most memorable characters created during Doctor Who's final years. &quot;The Mysterious Planet&quot; introduces many elements which could be interesting (and were meant to be dealt with later on, but most are never touched upon, or are addressed insufficiently), and there is some simply dreadful acting by many of the guest stars.Parts 5-8 (&quot;Mindwarp&quot;) are not too much better, with writer Phillip Martin resurrecting his character Sil (from &quot;Vengeance on Varos&quot;) and writing a script filled with some good ideas, but lacking in its final execution. Colin Baker ends up having to play the Doctor as totally unlikable for several episodes, but once (and if) one gets over that, one does realise it's a good performance. Brian Blessed is predictably over-the-top as King Yrcannos, and Nicola Bryant as Peri manages a solid last performance. The plot is not especially memorable, though the ending is rather shocking, and I'd even say daring if later on in Part 14 it was not totally undermined.Parts 9-12 (&quot;Terror of the Vervoids&quot;) are quite good. While it takes flak for introducing the screaming, far too perky Mel, and having an equally campy feel to it (largely in part due to its irritating and inapproriately jolly incidental music) it is a superior script and is filled with good acting, action, mystery and suspense. This story of a series of murders aboard a spaceliner will surely be appreciated. And Mel really isn't that bad - she's not a terrible character here, and it's my opinion that she, like Peri, debuted fairly well, then degenerated when placed alongside a new lead actor.Parts 13 and 14 (&quot;The Ultimate Foe&quot; or &quot;Time Inc.&quot;) are also good, but unfortunately, Robert Holmes never finished what he wanted to do with them. His Part 13 is strange and fairly interesting, slightly reminiscent of his acclaimed &quot;The Deadly Assassin&quot; but it doesn't stand out as a very memorable episode. Part 14 is a somewhat satisfying conclusion overall, but loose ends persist, and as a finale to Colin Baker's era it is surely a disappointment.Throughout &quot;The Trial of a Time Lord&quot; there is commentary by the Doctor as he watches these events from a trial room. The commentary is usually obtrusive, and some of the worst dialogue happens in these scenes, with artificial humor leaking in without producing the desired effect upon the viewer (unless said effect was meant to be incessant rolling of the eyes and wincing). Far too many episode cliffhangers end with unintentionally funny closeups of Colin Baker reacting to some sudden but usually uninteresting plot twist in the courtroom. The overall story idea itself is not particularly original, but many of the events and setups that take place are engaging (when fully pursued), and The Valeyard character introduced here is a notable villain.If you really desire to complete your Colin collection, by all means buy this set - it's worth it in the end, (and it's far cheaper than buying three videos separately) and there is just as much to love as there is to sadly malign - just don't watch it all in one sitting unless you really feel the need. The storyline isn't entirely planned out properly, many of the production values are cheaper-looking than usual (save for the oft-talked about opening space sequence) and the majority of the music is lacking. Still, there are a smattering of good ideas and good characters, and Colin Baker gives a masterful performance, but if you want to see more entertaining 6th Doctor stories, I recommend &quot;Vengenace on Varos,&quot; &quot;The Two Doctors&quot; and especially &quot;Revelation of the Daleks.&quot;",3,Ambitious but average,981676800,"02 9, 2001",2001,5061,"['expanded', 'earlier', 'anonymous',

344014,A15K1QU7XE1Z9A,6302884969,John Liosatos,"[7, 7]","The 5-star rating encompasses the whole Colin Baker era, the most underrated in Dr Who history.  Colin Baker has the distinction of being the only Doctor not to leave the show of his own will.  In other words, he was fired. Michael Grade, BBC Controller at that time, took it upon himself to order John Nathan-Turner to replace Baker.  This was most unfortunate, as Baker brought a fresh, energetic approach to the role.  He relished playing the Doctor, even stating at one point that he intended to stick around long enough to break Tom Baker's record tenure.  This is a departure from the previous Doctor, who intended to stay on for only three years so as not to become typecast in the role.The Colin Baker era is unfairly criticized for its undue violence.  While it has its violent moments, is it any more violent than the UNIT era (arguably the best era in Doctor Who history)? Or how about Genesis of the Daleks, which opens with a soldier in a gas mask?  If you want non-violent Who, watch the first several Hartnell stories. But even those contain scenes such as cavemen clubbing each other to death and daleks who ""EX-TER-MI-NATE"".It took the Doctor six incarnations to finally get it. He understood that showing compassion for someone who's trying to kill you is ridiculously stupid.  He understood that it's kill or be killed. His ""uncompassionate"" nature has been targeted by clueless critics who can't distinguish between killing an innocent victim and killing a vicious killer.  The doctor's killing of Shockeye in ""The Two Doctors"" is a favorite target of these boneheads. I say if a murderous letch with the ""strength to snap you in half with one hand"", as the Doctor states, is out to kill you and have you for dinner, you do what you can to survive. Maybe these aformentioned critics would have rather seen the Doctor confront Shockeye, offer him a joint and sing ""Kumbaya"" to him like the pot-smoking hippies that these critics are. Yet these are the same critics who hypocritically prefer the violent fabricated death of Peri than the true peaceful resolution devised for her.So why was Colin Baker fired?  That question baffled me, until I read somewhere that Michael Grade was dating Liza Goddard, Colin's ex-wife, at the time. I fully understand now. A professional vendetta is very unprofessional of you, Mr. Grade.Consider who followed Baker, and what kind of stories we had to endure (i.e. Crappiness Patrol), it was only a matter of time before the series was killed off for good.

The Trial of a Time Lord was perhaps my favorite collection of his work. I like the idea of linking episodes in a arc - it certainly worked well for ""The Key to Time"" and ""Babylon 5!""I like this set. The music is among the best from the Doctor Who series and as far as I remember it was also one of the first to use synthesizer music. As a college graduate in music I understand the detractions of the synthesizer, chiefly many professional musicians are replaced with one thus added to the unemployment statistics.

I saw &quot;Trial of a Timelord&quot; as the dismal cap on a series run from greatness to ruin in a few short years.  The &quot;trial&quot; plot is cobbled together to salvage the production of three incomplete episodes that were in various stages of completion when the BBC decided to put the show out of its misery.  There's no doubt that the best of the Colin Baker era is here, but that is condemning with faint praise.
