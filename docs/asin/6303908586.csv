Judging by the jacket, I thought I was sitting down to watch a Steven King type &quot;priest battles demon&quot; plot.  About 1/2 hour into this movie I knew exactly what I was watching and for the next hour or so, went through an array of emotions ranging from anger at the turmoil this man had to endure at the hands of  &quot;man-made rules&quot;, frustration at watching this man struggle between his vows and his human conscience in order to protect a child, disheartenment at the way this man was ultimately ostracized by his fellow man, and sadness that it took the innocence of a child to grant this man ultimate forgiveness and acceptance.  I would love to see this film remade into an American version. I believe if well directed and cast it would make for academy award material.  For those of you who think otherwise, this is no anti-catholocist movie. If you can look beyond the seemingly, and maintain an open mind, you will see that this movie goes far beyond the obvious multi- controversial issue theme. This movie is deep, thought provoking and emotionally stirring.  The bottom line is humility + fallibility + forgiveness=HUMANITY.... lest ye be judged.",5,Priest...

387920,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6303908586,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 4]","Controversy surrounds this drama about a priest coming to terms with his own dark secrets.  While the overall emotional climax never falters in its ability to derail the audience, the film for me falls short in some key areas.  That said, it also rises in a big way in a major area (the acting) which is probably the most essential area in which a film of this nature can excel.We have to believe these characters, and thanks to Linus Roache and Tom Wilkinson, we do.The film tells the story of Father Greg Pilkington, a likable young priest who is harboring a dark secret regarding his sexuality to promises to destroy him if it ever is revealed.  This secret and its destructive nature causes Father Pilkington (and the audience) to question the rules between sex and religion, a controversial (taboo) subject if ever there was one, especially in this day and age.  In the handling of this subject, the film succeeds in some areas, but overall it winds up becoming a tad too preachy.  I much prefer my films to add layers of ambiguity, especially when they concern subjects that are widely disagreed on.  You never want to feel as though a film is telling you how to feel if you don't feel the way they want you to.  I look at films like `Dead Man Walking' or `4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days', films that presented very controversial subjects in a way that alienated no one because we are still left to decide for ourselves what side of the tracks we stand on.  I didn't feel that way with `Priest'.  I also felt that the unnecessary sub-plot with the abused girl was yet another way for the film to `tell us what to feel' without having to spell it out, and I found it more of a distraction than anything else.Another issue I have with the film is that the production itself feels rather cheap at times, like a `made for television' film, and that took away from the gritty rawness this type of film needs to really `go there'.But, a major selling point here is the two key performances, that of Linus Roache and Tom Wilkinson.  Roache has a very complex and emotionally taxing character to portray, and he could have easily fallen into a clich&eacute;d portrayal (ala Tom Hanks in that `Philadelphia' film) but instead he really dug deep into his character and drew out a fantastically meaningful and absorbing performance.  We know this man and we understand this man and his `sins' haunt us.  Even more impressive to me was Tom Wilkinson, who got saddled with some of the films more `preachy' moments.  The way he handled it is highly commendable, for he makes the most straightforward of Hollywood `spoon-feeding' palatable.  You swallow everything he feeds you with no hesitation.Great, and I mean G-R-E-A-T performance.In the end I must admit to being slightly disappointed with `Priest' as a whole.  It had the promise of delivering an insightful and poignant look at a taboo subject, but instead fell into a clich&eacute;d and force-fed delivery that took away from the haunting nature of the film.",3,Stifled by its inability to remain neutral...,1276732800,"06 17, 2010",2010,3007,"['Controversy', 'drama', 'priest', 'coming', 'terms', 'own', 'dark', 'secrets', 'overall', 'emotional', 'climax', 'never', 'ability', 'derail', 'audience', 'film', 'short', 'key', 'areas', 'said', 'also', 'big', 'way', 'major', 'area', 'acting', 'probably', 'most', 'essential', 'area', 'film', 'nature', 'can', 'excel.We', 'have', 'believe', 'characters', 'thanks', 'Linus', 'Roache', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'do.The', 'film', 'story', 'Father', 'Greg', 'Pilkington', 'likable', 'young', 'priest', 'who', 'harboring', 'dark', 'secret', 'regarding', 'sexuality', 'promises', 'destroy', 'ever', 'revealed', 'secret', 'destructive', 'nature', 'Father', 'Pilkington', 'audience', 'question', 'rules', 'sex', 'religion', 'controversial', 'taboo', 'subject', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'especially', 'day', 'age', 'handling', 'subject', 'film', 'areas', 'overall', 'up', 'becoming', 'tad', 'too', 'preachy', 'much', 'prefer', 'films', 'add', 'layers', 'ambiguity', 'especially', 'when', 'concern', 'subjects', 'are', 'widely', 'disagreed', 'never', 'want', 'feel', 'film', 'telling', 'how', 'feel', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'way', 'want', 'look', 'films', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Walking', '4', 'Months', '3', 'Weeks', '2', 'Days', 'films', 'presented', 'very', 'controversial', 'subjects', 'way', 'alienated', 'one', 'are', 'still', 'left', 'decide', 'what', 'side', 'tracks', 'stand', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'way', 'Priest', 'also', 'felt', 'unnecessary', 'sub-plot', 'abused', 'girl', 'was', 'yet', 'way', 'film', 'tell', 'feel', 'having', 'spell', 'out', 'found', 'more', 'distraction', 'anything', 'else.Another', 'issue', 'have', 'film', 'production', 'rather', 'cheap', 'times', 'made', 'television', 'film', 'took', 'away', 'gritty', 'rawness', 'type', 'film', 'needs', 'really', 'go', ""there'.But"", 'major', 'selling', 'point', 'here', 'two', 'key', 'performances', 'Linus', 'Roache', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'Roache', 'very', 'complex', 'emotionally', 'taxing', 'character', 'portray', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'fallen', 'clich', 'eacute', 'portrayal', 'ala', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Philadelphia', 'film', 'instead', 'really', 'dug', 'deep', 'character', 'drew', 'out', 'fantastically', 'meaningful', 'absorbing', 'performance', 'know', 'man', 'understand', 'man', 'sins', 'haunt', 'Even', 'more', 'impressive', 'was', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'who', 'got', 'saddled', 'films', 'more', 'preachy', 'moments', 'way', 'handled', 'highly', 'commendable', 'most', 'straightforward', 'Hollywood', 'spoon-feeding', 'palatable', 'swallow', 'everything', 'hesitation.Great', 'mean', 'G-R-E-A-T', 'end', 'must', 'admit', 'being', 'slightly', 'disappointed', 'Priest', 'whole', 'had', 'promise', 'delivering', 'insightful', 'poignant', 'look', 'taboo', 'subject', 'instead', 'fell', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'force-fed', 'delivery', 'took', 'away', 'haunting', 'nature', 'film']",Priest VHS

The acting is superb.  Here a young Gay priest (Linus Roache) and a fellow straight priest (Tom Wilkinson) each give in to their desires for sexual gratification.  When the Gay priest's affair with another man becomes public knowledge, he faces severe alienation and scorn from his congregation.  His own inner conflicts and public shame are mirrored in the heart wrenching discovery that a little girl in his parish is being abused by her father. After sharing her pain with him during Confession, he has to deal with the dilemma of either immediately taking action to help her or keeping the vow of confessional secrecy.Tom Wilkinson is a wonderful british actor whose talents have graced other notably outstanding films, such as ""The Full Monty"" and ""Wilde"".",4,Devotion Tested By Temptations of the Flesh,1358380800,"01 17, 2013",2013,934,"['most', 'compelling', 'poignant', 'movie', 'inner', 'conflicts', 'most', 'priests', 'undoubtedly', 'face', 'point', 'regarding', 'celibacy', 'sexual', 'temptation', 'acting', 'superb', 'Here', 'young', 'Gay', 'priest', 'Linus', 'Roache', 'fellow', 'straight', 'priest', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'give', 'desires', 'sexual', 'gratification', 'When', 'Gay', 'priest', 'affair', 'man', 'public', 'knowledge', 'severe', 'alienation', 'scorn', 'congregation', 'own', 'inner', 'conflicts', 'public', 'shame', 'are', 'mirrored', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'discovery', 'little', 'girl', 'parish', 'being', 'abused', 'father', 'sharing', 'pain', 'Confession', 'deal', 'dilemma', 'immediately', 'taking', 'action', 'help', 'keeping', 'vow', 'confessional', 'secrecy.Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'wonderful', 'british', 'actor', 'talents', 'have', 'graced', 'other', 'notably', 'outstanding', 'films', 'such', 'Full', 'Monty', 'Wilde']",Priest VHS

387923,AKBKTA49ZTT2T,6303908586,Bruce,"[6, 6]","The striking opening sequence of 'Priest' depicts an enraged elderly cleric, having learned he is being pushed into retirement, utilizing a large crucifix as a battering ram and raiding the offices of the bishop; the climax of the film is one of the most powerful, emotionally shattering scenes I have ever seen, imbued with forgiveness and redemption and humanity at its shining best, courageously in the face of humanity at its self-righteous worst. In between is a searing indictment of the outdated practices of the Catholic Church and its breeding of intolerance and hate. Father Greg Pilkington (portrayed with astonishing clarity and mesmerizing, gut-wrenching passion by Linus Roache) is a young, idealistic priest who is more than a little put-off by his unorthodox partner, Father Matthew Thomas (a wonderful performance by the great Tom Wilkinson), who sings karaoke at the neighborhood pub and sleeps with the housekeeper. But Father Greg's smug little world soon begins to spin out of control as he attempts to deal with his own homosexuality and with a heartbreaking secret learned by him in the confessional. Roache's breathtaking performance is palpable and eloquently harrowing as Father Greg becomes more and more tortured by guilt and grief. Also in the film, in a winning, endearing turn, is Robert Carlyle (one of Wilkinson's cohorts in 'The Full Monty') as Graham, the object (and the victim) of Father Greg's affection. 'Priest' is a remarkable and revelatory piece of work, intelligent and gripping and deeply felt.

387925,A27DHFFWMH042Y,6303908586,"Cathleen M. Walker ""geminiwalker""","[4, 6]","I found every review I ever read about this movie misleading. It is not about homosexuality, it is not about evil priests, and it is certainly not against the Church. In fact, the Church might want to consider just how sympathetic to Priests the movie actually is. The troubled main character is portrayed sensitively and sympathetically. I thought the movie was an exploration of dogma, religion, faith, sin, the 'dark night of the soul', celibacy, sexuality and, oh yes, love. The greatest commandment of all. How sad that the loving thing to do is so often considered a sin. I don't think the main character walked away from his sexuality at the end at all. I think he took a stand for it in the face of the hate and bigotry that the parishioners threw at him. He had decided not to see his lover again -- but he had never decided that he was not who he was, and that it was not love. In fact, the relationship was so clearly loving despite the fact that they hardly knew each other that I developed a much better understanding of the desperate self-hatred and frustration of love that homophobia breeds. Homophobia is hardly Christian when it creates such self-contempt and loathing and builds such painful walls.Would two men found making love in a car create tabloid headlines? Probably not. Unless, that is, one of them was a Priest.Who was doing the loving thing? The gay lover who was there for the Priest no matter how difficult it seemed to be for him? Or the sexually abusive father who did not care anything about the feelings of his wife and daughter? The Priest did not want to break the confessional seal, and he was respecting the wish of the young girl not to be violated yet again by having her confidence betrayed. How often he *begged* her to allow him to tell someone! And how important it was to her that he not do so! Her trust in the Priest was crucial to any healing she might do. He needed her permission, if not by law, than by virtue of the trust she had in him. It was a miracle that God intervened through prayer.As a result of viewing this movie, I am much more open-minded about the difficulties of being within such a troubled institution. I have my issues with the Roman Catholic Church, don't get me wrong. But this movie made it possible for me to care just a little bit more about the people within it who feel just as violated by the institutionalized betrayal as I am.Many priests have secret sexual relationships (which means they must also be using birth control) and the reason why as explained in the movie is true. It's about keeping property within the church. Yet the hypocrisy of the church attempting to control everyone *else's* sexuality while flaunting their own rules to suit their own purposes discredits any value the church may yet have. Sexual repression serves no one, and confuses the issue that *might* have made it possible for the Priest to stand up to the abusive father. What is the loving thing to do? Dogma be damned. Love. It's the greatest commandment there is.I have no problem with sexual Priests if they can be honest and loving about it, and not utilize the income of tithing and trusting parishioners to support the lie they live. I *do* have a problem with the many Priests who are so confused and repressed that generations of children have paid the price with the sexual abuse of their bodies while the Church looks the other way. (See review: Lead Us Not Into Temptation by Jason Berry.) The movie does not touch that can of worms, after all, it couldn't cover everything. It did provide much in the way of food for thought, and I'm glad it raised the issue of the sexual abuse of children at all, as well as the arguments that are used to justify it. There is, of course, no justification for that. It is simply not the loving thing to do.",5,"An exploration of dogma, religion, faith, sin...and love.",974678400,"11 20, 2000",2000,3817,"['found', 'review', 'ever', 'read', 'movie', 'misleading', 'not', 'homosexuality', 'not', 'evil', 'priests', 'certainly', 'not', 'Church', 'fact', 'Church', 'might', 'want', 'consider', 'just', 'how', 'sympathetic', 'Priests', 'movie', 'actually', 'troubled', 'main', 'character', 'portrayed', 'sensitively', 'sympathetically', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'exploration', 'dogma', 'religion', 'faith', 'sin', ""'dark"", 'night', 'soul', 'celibacy', 'sexuality', 'oh', 'yes', 'love', 'greatest', 'commandment', 'How', 'sad', 'loving', 'thing', 'do', 'so', 'often', 'considered', 'sin', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'main', 'character', 'walked', 'away', 'sexuality', 'end', 'think', 'took', 'stand', 'face', 'hate', 'bigotry', 'parishioners', 'threw', 'had', 'decided', 'not', 'see', 'lover', 'again', 'had', 'never', 'decided', 'was', 'not', 'who', 'was', 'was', 'not', 'love', 'fact', 'relationship', 'was', 'so', 'clearly', 'loving', 'fact', 'hardly', 'knew', 'other', 'developed', 'much', 'better', 'understanding', 'desperate', 'self-hatred', 'frustration', 'love', 'breeds', 'Homophobia', 'hardly', 'Christian', 'when', 'such', 'self-contempt', 'loathing', 'builds', 'such', 'painful', 'walls.Would', 'two', 'men', 'found', 'making', 'love', 'car', 'create', 'tabloid', 'headlines', 'Probably', 'not', 'Unless', 'one', 'was', 'Priest.Who', 'was', 'doing', 'loving', 'thing', 'gay', 'lover', 'who', 'was', 'Priest', 'matter', 'how', 'difficult', 'seemed', 'be', 'sexually', 'abusive', 'father', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'anything', 'feelings', 'wife', 'daughter', 'Priest', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'break', 'confessional', 'seal', 'was', 'respecting', 'wish', 'young', 'girl', 'not', 'be', 'violated', 'yet', 'again', 'having', 'confidence', 'betrayed', 'How', 'often', 'allow', 'tell', 'someone', 'how', 'important', 'was', 'not', 'do', 'so', 'trust', 'Priest', 'was', 'crucial', 'healing', 'might', 'do', 'needed', 'permission', 'not', 'law', 'virtue', 'trust', 'had', 'was', 'miracle', 'God', 'intervened', 'prayer.As', 'result', 'viewing', 'movie', 'am', 'much', 'more', 'open-minded', 'difficulties', 'being', 'troubled', 'institution', 'have', 'issues', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'movie', 'made', 'possible', 'care', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'people', 'who', 'feel', 'just', 'violated', 'institutionalized', 'betrayal', 'am.Many', 'priests', 'have', 'secret', 'sexual', 'relationships', 'must', 'also', 'be', 'using', 'birth', 'control', 'reason', 'why', 'explained', 'movie', 'true', 'keeping', 'property', 'church', 'hypocrisy', 'church', 'attempting', 'control', 'everyone', ""*else's*"", 'sexuality', 'flaunting', 'own', 'rules', 'suit', 'own', 'purposes', 'value', 'church', 'may', 'yet', 'have', 'Sexual', 'repression', 'one', 'issue', '*might*', 'have', 'made', 'possible', 'Priest', 'stand', 'up', 'abusive', 'father', 'What', 'loving', 'thing', 'do', 'Dogma', 'be', 'damned', 'Love', 'greatest', 'commandment', 'there', 'is.I', 'have', 'problem', 'sexual', 'Priests', 'can', 'be', 'honest', 'loving', 'not', 'utilize', 'income', 'tithing', 'trusting', 'parishioners', 'support', 'lie', 'live', '*do*', 'have', 'problem', 'many', 'Priests', 'who', 'are', 'so', 'confused', 'repressed', 'generations', 'children', 'have', 'paid', 'price', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'bodies', 'Church', 'other', 'way', 'See', 'review', 'Lead', 'Us', 'Not', 'Into', 'Temptation', 'Jason', 'Berry', 'movie', 'not', 'touch', 'can', 'worms', 'could', ""n't"", 'cover', 'everything', 'did', 'provide', 'much', 'way', 'food', 'thought', ""'m"", 'glad', 'raised', 'issue', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'children', 'as', 'well', 'arguments', 'are', 'used', 'justify', 'course', 'justification', 'simply', 'not', 'loving', 'thing', 'do']",Priest VHS

It deals more with issues considered taboo by the church, such as homosexuality, incest, and the judgmental society. Some people may even lose interest from it; this is not a movie for everyone. But, it does leave a lasting impression in the mind, raising up questions and debates about religion that even the film itself does not resolve.The film begins with a man carrying a cross from the church to the home of the Bishop, who has replaced him with a newcomer to Liverpool.

This puts a small strain on their growing friendship, but it gives way once bigger conflicts begins appearing.Just as Father Matthew avoids celibacy, Greg breaks the vow by going to a pub and picking up (surprise) a man, going back to his place, and having a one-night stand. Once his homosexuality is revealed to us, the movie takes on a much bigger challenge of mixing religious persecution and moral beliefs, as Greg must choose between keeping his vows of faith or revealing his secrets.Greg's homosexuality is handled in many different ways, and seen in many different views and opinions, including his own of himself. Once it becomes known that their priest is gay, the members of the congregation begins to dissipate, and even the Bishop asks him to leave, even as Father Matthew pleads with them to be compassionate. This prejudice and hate makes way for some very nice introspective into the hypocrisy that permeates the church and its followers (&quot;Let he who is without sin cast the first stone&quot;).It is Greg's own inner torment that heightens the movie to an emotional level. He establishes the fact early on that he considers his own lifestyle to be sinful, yet he cannot stop thinking about being with a man. He begins to rationalize with a crucifix in his room over what is right and wrong; his inner conflicts with himself are powerful and moving, and just as he asks God for an answer, we find ourselves asking the same question.His inner torment extends to other situations as well. In a very intriguing side story, a young girl named Lisa reveals that her father sexually abuses her, putting Greg on the spot of whether to break the vow of confession or keep these truths hidden. The situation gets very tense as Greg begins tearing himself apart inside. Not only is he fighting his own personal war, but someone else's, someone with whom he will find comfort at the film's heart-stopping finale.The only flaw that blemishes this film's beauty is the way in which it showcases Father Matthew as a gay rights activist during the movie's third act. He invites Greg to stand with him for a service, which causes an uproar among the parishioners. He then proceeds to invite people to leave the church. His words here seem more like demands than pleas, sounding just a bit, well, preachy.It is the flawless performances of the cast that really bring home the emotion throughout this film. Linus Roache gives one of the best performances of 1995 as Father Greg, torn between himself and his vows to the church. He brings true emotion to the role, so much so that we believe in his character and his fears. Tom Wilkinson is convincing as Father Matthew, whose open-minded thinking serves as a beacon of light for Greg. Wilkinson is blunt and forceful, a brilliant mix.&quot;Priest&quot; is a highly controversial film about religion and sin, about taking a stand for ones beliefs or backing down in fear, and ultimately about facing that fear. We can believe in Greg's pain because we have all experienced a situation like his. And whether or not you may agree with the movie's message, or however bad you may consider it to be, a movie that makes you think about so many issues for days after you see it cannot be bad.",4,"An effective, thought-inducing film experience!",997056000,"08 6, 2001",2001,4027,"['take-it-or-leave-it', 'drama', 'quot', 'Priest', 'quot', 'not', 'everyday', 'religious', 'examination', 'film', 'more', 'issues', 'considered', 'taboo', 'church', 'such', 'homosexuality', 'incest', 'judgmental', 'society', 'people', 'may', 'even', 'lose', 'interest', 'not', 'movie', 'everyone', 'leave', 'lasting', 'impression', 'mind', 'raising', 'up', 'questions', 'debates', 'religion', 'even', 'film', 'not', 'resolve.The', 'film', 'man', 'carrying', 'cross', 'church', 'home', 'Bishop', 'who', 'replaced', 'newcomer', 'Liverpool', 'Greg', 'Pilkington', 'Linus', 'Roache', 'conservative', 'man', 'cloth', 'arrives', 'appalled', 'fellow', 'priest', 'Matthew', 'Thomas', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'celibacy', 'relationship', 'black', 'housekeeper', 'small', 'strain', 'growing', 'friendship', 'way', 'once', 'bigger', 'conflicts', 'appearing.Just', 'Father', 'Matthew', 'avoids', 'celibacy', 'Greg', 'vow', 'going', 'pub', 'picking', 'up', 'surprise', 'man', 'going', 'back', 'place', 'having', 'one-night', 'stand', 'homosexuality', 'revealed', 'movie', 'much', 'bigger', 'challenge', 'mixing', 'religious', 'persecution', 'moral', 'beliefs', 'Greg', 'must', 'choose', 'keeping', 'vows', 'faith', 'revealing', 'secrets.Greg', 'homosexuality', 'handled', 'many', 'different', 'ways', 'seen', 'many', 'different', 'views', 'opinions', 'including', 'own', 'known', 'priest', 'gay', 'members', 'congregation', 'dissipate', 'even', 'Bishop', 'leave', 'even', 'Father', 'Matthew', 'be', 'compassionate', 'prejudice', 'hate', 'way', 'very', 'nice', 'introspective', 'hypocrisy', 'church', 'followers', 'quot', 'who', 'sin', 'cast', 'first', 'stone', 'quot', '.It', 'Greg', 'own', 'inner', 'torment', 'movie', 'emotional', 'level', 'fact', 'early', 'own', 'lifestyle', 'be', 'sinful', 'yet', 'can', 'not', 'stop', 'thinking', 'being', 'man', 'rationalize', 'crucifix', 'room', 'what', 'right', 'wrong', 'inner', 'conflicts', 'are', 'powerful', 'moving', 'just', 'God', 'answer', 'find', 'asking', 'same', 'question.His', 'inner', 'torment', 'extends', 'other', 'situations', 'well', 'very', 'intriguing', 'side', 'story', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Lisa', 'reveals', 'father', 'sexually', 'putting', 'Greg', 'spot', 'break', 'vow', 'confession', 'keep', 'truths', 'hidden', 'situation', 'very', 'tense', 'Greg', 'tearing', 'apart', 'inside', 'Not', 'only', 'fighting', 'own', 'personal', 'war', 'someone', 'else', 'someone', 'whom', 'will', 'find', 'comfort', 'film', 'heart-stopping', 'finale.The', 'only', 'blemishes', 'film', 'beauty', 'way', 'Father', 'Matthew', 'gay', 'rights', 'activist', 'movie', 'third', 'act', 'Greg', 'stand', 'service', 'uproar', 'parishioners', 'then', 'invite', 'people', 'leave', 'church', 'words', 'here', 'seem', 'more', 'demands', 'pleas', 'sounding', 'just', 'bit', 'well', 'preachy.It', 'flawless', 'performances', 'cast', 'really', 'bring', 'home', 'emotion', 'film', 'Linus', 'Roache', 'one', 'best', 'performances', '1995', 'Father', 'Greg', 'torn', 'vows', 'church', 'true', 'emotion', 'role', 'so', 'much', 'believe', 'character', 'fears', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'convincing', 'Father', 'Matthew', 'open-minded', 'thinking', 'serves', 'beacon', 'light', 'Greg', 'Wilkinson', 'blunt', 'forceful', 'brilliant', 'mix.', 'quot', 'Priest', 'quot', 'highly', 'controversial', 'film', 'religion', 'sin', 'taking', 'stand', 'ones', 'beliefs', 'backing', 'down', 'fear', 'ultimately', 'facing', 'fear', 'can', 'believe', 'Greg', 'pain', 'have', 'experienced', 'situation', 'not', 'may', 'agree', 'movie', 'message', 'however', 'bad', 'may', 'consider', 'be', 'movie', 'think', 'so', 'many', 'issues', 'days', 'see', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'bad']",Priest VHS

Linus Roache is a revelation as Father Greg Pilkington, who finds his sexual orientation conflicting with his religious faith. The film raises many issues, making the question of celibacy only one of many points. There is also hypocrisy, homophobia, shame, incest...it runs the gamut of emotions. Tom Wilkinson is also brilliant as the parish rector who is having an affair with his housemaid (Cathy Tyson). The deep-seeded condemnation of Father Greg, who truly wants to practice his religious faith but is shamed into a failed suicide attempt, is maddening.

Melillo ""gloriana""","[7, 8]","Linus Roache's performance is outstanding - his expression of emotion so real and intense that the viewer can feel the confusion, conflict, and pain as his character confronts the eternal problem of faith versus personal  practise of what one believes. His character, who, unlike many clergy  depicted in controversial films, obviously is a true believer in both his  religion and his vocation, struggles with integrating his convictions with  his life overall. For example, one wonders why he is shocked by and  extremely condemning of his pastor's concubinage, preaching at Matthew  about how priests must set an impeccable moral example, when he himself is  an active homosexual.This film is good, not outstanding. Its being very  controversial when it was issued, and its addressing delicate topics such  as paedophilia, incest, and whether the seal of confession was charity or  foolishness, caused it to be overrated. The underlying theme (integrating  how one lives with what one believes) is clear, but the plot development is  poor.

387932,A3BWP965RIWBCU,6303908586,"Gerald Parker ""Gerald Parker""","[0, 0]","I had expected this B.B.C. film (Alliance 17505 being the North American edition viewed), from all of the controversy and brouhaha about it, to be much more explosively bitter in tone than, in fact, it is. Enough folks have said sufficient things about its content, so I won't belabour matters about these now fading controversies regarding this motion picture. I find the film deeply moving, despite not agreeing with its implicit premise that compassion lets a priest ""off the hook"" regarding his sacred vows, though I think that the Church should be able to relieve him of his vows to return to secular life without traumatising him and everybody else who may be in his ambit who still is susceptible, despite such times as these, to such shock. Neither Fr. Greg, the gay young priest, nor his heterosexual superior, Fr. Matthew, should have made such vows, i.e. should not have sought ordination. In the case of the former, to be a gay man, sexually active or otherwise, and also a Catholic is one thing; to be a sexually active gay Catholic priest under vows, however, is indefensible. Similar strictures apply to his wayward sexually ""straight"" superior, Fr. Matthew, whose own secretly active (""straight"") sexual life is not in keeping with his ordination vow of consecrated celibacy.However, I have low expectations of priests. I am a believing and intermittently observant Roman Catholic, but I do not accept the line that priests are, humanly speaking, special men in these sad times. In fact I have such a low opinion of the priestly fraternity that I avoid priests like the plague; I try to avoid them before or after Mass, impatiently glide by or circumvent them at the church entrance. Catholic clergymen are, 90% or so of them, lazy creeps and have been so since the way that the implementation of the changes (real or purported) of the Second Vatican Council (""Vat.-2"") lowered standards so drastically. One sees an example of this in the film, where the rigourously harsh old priest tries to converse in Latin with the gay young priestly dude, in rather simple Latin at that even for a Latin-rusty layman like myself, and the younger man has almost no idea of what the older man is saying. Latin is not the end of it; the seminaries have churned out priests who are opinionated cusses but, in parishes with a good representation of professional folk and skilled labourers, are more ignorant than most of their congregants are in regard to their respective callings' body of expertise. Why should we respect these ignorant supposed mavens? Then, as if their bland ignorance were not bad enough, the standards of holiness and devotion, as well as knowledge of all things Catholic (like doctrine, apologetics, Holy Scripture, patristics, basic plainchant) have plummeted. Priests now, for the most part, do not even attempt to live holy lives, though at least the gay young priest of this film carries out the duties of hearing confessions (sacramentally rather than amateur therapeutically, at that) and doing the rounds of visitations to Catholic households, with which few current-day priests in so many dioceses, now so lax, bother themselves.So, it is not surprising that the two post-Vat.-2 priests, the senior of the two co-habiting with his housekeeper, the junior one, when things get tough, going out to cruise for gay companionship and sex, finding a bed partner who is truly sympathetic and appealing. Yes, the Western Rite Catholic Church would do well to be in conformity with the Eastern Catholic (Byzantine) Rite (and the Eastern Orthodox Church) in permitting priests, under set conditions, to marry. A greater good hardly could befall the Church, to deliver it from the fornicating and often homosexual unmarried clerical profession that serves it so poorly. However, as things continue to stand, the integrity of vows stands, in the face of whatever clerical discipline regarding celibacy or its preferred rarity that prevails and is in effect at any particular time in any particular Rite, Western or Eastern of the papal Church.The priesthood in recent decades is of mind-crushing, soul-numbing mediocrity, in what has morphed, since 1965 or so, into a dumbed-down, hypocritical profession. It is a job for a man who has no real talent for much of anything and yet likes the easy pay and gentility of the position. So, yeah, I feel for these clerical dudes' sexual predicament, since I am human and react as one, but they can go stuff their heads in the toilet and flush so far as being somehow worthy of any special regard. We laity have a right to be pious and observant but also anti-clerical. Priests are an unavoidable necessity, to carry out the sacramental life of the Church, but they deserve no special praise for that, since they do it, ever increasingly, so poorly and either listlessly or prissily. I would rather talk to the parish janitor about the latest in cleaning supplies than to a priest about anything soever! I expect NOTHING of priests, since they have ""delivered"" so little for so many long years. I once did respect, many at least, of the priests whom I knew who were formed pre-Vat.-2, but they were another kind of men and priests altogether than the lounge lizards at our altars today, who refuse even to prepare a sermon that lasts more than five minutes, in part because they are too lazy, also in part because they are too ignorant or downright stupid. So, yeah, I do not find this film shocking; it is rather just rather (too hiply) realistic.It is worth seeing ""Priest"" and it is, indeed, touching, but the Church that it depicts is one that should not be what it is. The acting of the entire cast is excellent and the film well captures the bleak cityscapes of England's industrial northern metropolises.  I do wish that this DVD edition had included some ""special features"" about a film that has generated so much controversy, heated comment, and far too much misunderstanding as ""Priest"" most certainly has done so, but the censorship that already afflicts the DVD edition probably hints at wariness to go down those paths in making the film available.  To avoid such censorship, by the way, there are, fortunately, alternative editions from the U.K. (on videotape) and the Netherlands (on DVD as Homescreen Edition 6150) in English with Dutch subtitles (but with none in any additional language), which apparently also presents the film uncensored, though whether to the same degree as the British videotape I am not in a position to certify. That fact makes less difference than it would do so for many films so bowdlerised, because this is not, really, a film about sex but rather one about sin, grace, and reconciliation. Consequently, there is only rather little more in the way of explicitly salacious footage, at least on the Dutch DVD (though perhaps there is more on the British videotape) than in U.S. editions, for any censored edition to cut out, but I am grateful to own the film also in this at least comparatively less mutilated form. Don't be frightened or intimidated, fellow Catholic: get a DVD of this movie, which has much of real value, despite some excessively modish concerns, to convey about the dingy corporate life to which the Roman Catholic Church has sunken.",4,Film That Is Deeply Affecting Despite Portraying the Hipness and Trend-Obsessed Liturgical Life of Contemporary Catholic Church,1321488000,"11 17,

387933,A1VJ7HYM1EC94M,6303908586,"G P Padillo ""paolo""","[4, 6]","11 years after its release, I finally got around to watching one of 1994's most controversial films.  I don't know what took me so long.This is the story of Father Greg Pilkington, an idealistic young priest appalled by the liberal-thinking, older priest he shares a congregation with. Clashes and airs of superiority from Father Greg set up, almost calculatedly, his crushing and inevitable fall from grace.  Try as he might, Father Greg, pious and as intolerant as ever, cannot suppress his sexuality and takes to the gay bar scene.  A casual pick up turns into an affair which in turn becomes a personal and professional disaster as an equally intolerant society pushes him towards wrongful arrest and a verdict of ""guilty.""  Father Greg becomes the object of derision and hatred by the bigoted, close minded community, itself a reflection of all the young priest exhibited in but a show of intolerance and sanctimoniousness.A central part of the story is when, during confession, a desperate young girl tells of sexual abuse at the hands of her father.  Eventually, this information becomes a test of faith for Father Greg as he questions his spirituality, the laws of the church and God.During all of this the older priest, Father Matthew, preaches of ""the trappings of power"" that the Church has saddled itself with - and how the trappings have gotten in the way of the message of God, of love, of tolerance, of patience and compassion. As might be expected, the Church's higher ups have little patience for this sort of talk - and the congregation itself shuns Father Greg turning mass into an explosive show of blind eyed fanaticism.As Father Greg, Linus Roche gives a searing, searching performance as the young tormented priest.  His fall and redemption, the center of the story, comes across with an earnestness that steers clear of sensationalism, despite the loaded message of the movie.  Tom Wilkinson, as ever, gives a performance that is as natural and believable - and likeable - as anything he's done before or since.

387934,A328S9RN3U5M68,6303908586,Grady Harp,"[4, 4]","Re-visiting PRIEST, a film by Antonia Bird that is genteel, soulful, yet probing and made in 1995, makes us realize how much of a wake-up call it was to the internal troubles wasting the Catholic Church so blasted in the media on a daily basis in 2003. This extraordinary film looks at the issues from the inside of the Church, issues such as incest, adultery, celibacy, homosexuality, privacy of the confessional, misguided allegiance to the parish in favor of the doctrine of the priesthood vows, etc.  Much of the sensitivity of the message of the film (that despite vows and dictums, priests are human beings whose occassional 'weaknesses' can make them even more effective as tenders of the flock) is due to superb performances by a cast of committed actors.  Tom Wilkinson shines as a priest who (against the vow of celibacy)lives with his lover, the tender and beautiful Cathy Tyson, dedicating his role for the common man, a priest who cares more about social injustice than about ancient rules of catholic order.  Linus Roache, as a creed-challenged young priest who copes with being gay as well as his inability to share confessional secrets about the incest of his parishoner Lisa (Christine Tremarco), and her trustingly uninformed mother (Lesly Sharp).  Robert Carlyle is Roache's 'lover' and is introduced to us in this film before he subsequently became the established actor he is today.  The affair between Roache and Carlyle is as sensual and touching as any gay affair on film.  The growing relationship between Wilkinson and Roache is humorous and tender and triumphant.  Antonia Bird directs with a taut eye on character and atmosphere and makes her story dark and light  and quiet and probing.  This is a fine film that just grows better with each watching.  The only moment of laxity comes at the very end when the heartstrings are pulled below pitch with the wholly unnecessary music background of 'You'll Never Walk Alone' muddying up an otherwise honestly moving film.",5,Another visit to the PRIEST,1060992000,"08 16, 2003",2003,1994,"['Re-visiting', 'PRIEST', 'film', 'Antonia', 'Bird', 'genteel', 'soulful', 'yet', 'probing', 'made', '1995', 'realize', 'how', 'much', 'wake-up', 'call', 'was', 'internal', 'troubles', 'wasting', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'so', 'blasted', 'media', 'daily', 'basis', '2003', 'extraordinary', 'film', 'looks', 'issues', 'inside', 'Church', 'issues', 'such', 'incest', 'adultery', 'celibacy', 'homosexuality', 'privacy', 'confessional', 'misguided', 'allegiance', 'parish', 'favor', 'doctrine', 'priesthood', 'vows', 'etc', 'Much', 'sensitivity', 'message', 'film', 'vows', 'dictums', 'priests', 'are', 'human', 'beings', 'occassional', ""'weaknesses"", 'can', 'make', 'even', 'more', 'effective', 'tenders', 'flock', 'due', 'superb', 'performances', 'cast', 'committed', 'actors', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'priest', 'who', 'vow', 'celibacy', 'lover', 'tender', 'beautiful', 'Cathy', 'Tyson', 'dedicating', 'role', 'common', 'man', 'priest', 'who', 'more', 'social', 'injustice', 'ancient', 'rules', 'catholic', 'order', 'Linus', 'Roache', 'creed-challenged', 'young', 'priest', 'who', 'being', 'gay', 'as', 'well', 'inability', 'share', 'confessional', 'secrets', 'incest', 'parishoner', 'Lisa', 'Christine', 'Tremarco', 'trustingly', 'uninformed', 'mother', 'Lesly', 'Sharp', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'Roache', ""'lover"", 'introduced', 'film', 'subsequently', 'became', 'established', 'actor', 'today', 'affair', 'Roache', 'Carlyle', 'sensual', 'touching', 'gay', 'affair', 'film', 'growing', 'relationship', 'Wilkinson', 'Roache', 'humorous', 'tender', 'triumphant', 'Antonia', 'Bird', 'taut', 'eye', 'character', 'atmosphere', 'story', 'dark', 'light', 'quiet', 'probing', 'fine', 'film', 'just', 'better', 'watching', 'only', 'moment', 'laxity', 'very', 'end', 'when', 'heartstrings', 'are', 'pulled', 'pitch', 'wholly', 'unnecessary', 'music', 'background', ""'You"", ""'ll"", 'Never', 'Walk', 'Alone', 'muddying', 'up', 'otherwise', 'honestly', 'moving', 'film']",Priest VHS

I can say that 'Priest', a film made more than 15 years ago is emotionally authentic and gripping from beginning to end.The story of 'Priest' follows Greg Pilkington (Linus Roache), a priest with (at first) very conservative views whos newly assigned to his perish. He lives with another priest, Matthew Thomas (played by Tom Wilkinson) who has very liberal views and is sleeping with their housekeeper (and not really keeping it a secret). Their idealogical clashing would've made a good film on it's own but the filmmakers don't stop there. Father Greg is also struggling with his homosexual urges and falls for a local man Graham (a young Robert Carlyle). Added to this is an even more powerful plot involving a young girl who confesses to Greg she's being sexually abused by her own father (back when priests were NOT encouraged to report crimes confessed in church). While it seems these problems have obvious solutions and the film seems to broderline on exploitivness it's Greg's internal struggle with his beliefs in what's really a very exploitive and strict ENVIRONMENT (in the context of this film) that gives this movie it's weight. There's no easy answers for these characters and this film doesn't pretend everything will work out in the end. I also like that despite the film's very anti-catholic message there's alot more to take away from it.The acting in this film is stellar right down to the smallest character. I've seen Linus Roache in bit parts in films (Batman Begins, Find Me Guilty) but the power he gives his character in 'Priest' shows how under-used he is as an actor. Tom Wilkinson has never been more likeable than as Mathew, Greg's somewhat mentor and pretty much his only real friend.Priest is something of a rarity in film. It could've easily been exploitive, or even sob-story of the week TV fare but the filmmakers and actors put so much authentic emotion into this story, that while sometimes not easy to watch is very captivating.

Michael Click,"[62, 66]","At its core, &quot;Priest&quot; is a thoughtful examination of faith,  conscience, and feeling and how those concepts can sometimes  conflict with dogma, ideology, and tradition ... more simply put, spirituality versus  religion.  As a long-term associate of an  Interfaith agency (and someone  who deals with persons from many  different faith communities), I found the  characters and plot  realistic, and was gratified that the script offered  no easy  answers to the dilemmas it presented.  Real life is often messy;  the film demonstrates that there are times when an ideal moral choice  is  neither clear nor even possible, and that a religious calling does  not  exempt one from the temptations and foibles of being human.  These same  tensions have been approached (usually as subplots) in many films over the  years, including &quot;The Song of Bernadette&quot; (1943), &quot;The Keys  of the Kingdom&quot; (1945), and &quot;The Left Hand of God&quot; (1955);  &quot;Priest&quot; pushes the envelope by exploring these themes in the  context of sexual situations within the Church.The DVD transfer is  beautiful, offering clear and crisp video and  sound.  The film features a  superb performance by Linus Roache,  and some very artful editing (with the  exception of a couple of spots  in which it's obvious that scenes have been  snipped by the censors' scissors).  I would have liked a few extras on the  DVD, like an  interview with the director and/or screenwriter, and perhaps  some  balanced coverage of the controversy the film has generated since its  release.  A theatrical trailer would also have been welcome.

Most people forget that the clergy struggles everyday with the same desires and problems, as the rest of the population.  Priest drove home the point, that both Father Greg and Father Matthew were hopelessly human despite their vocation.  In addition, it was clear that as humans both clergymen were capable of hypocrisy.  Father Greg was shocked at Father Matthew's sexual relationship with the housekeeper (Maria) played by Cathy Tyson.  In turn, Father Matthew was initially appalled at Father Greg's pious devotion.  I do admit laughing aloud when I found out that Father Greg was gay.  Not because he was gay, but because he had been so condemning of Father Matthew's shortcomings.  This movie addressed every issue of modern society and flung it back in the viewer's face for introspection.  What would you do in this situation?  Priest should have been longer, so that the viewer could know the fate of Father Greg and his relationship with Graham (Robert Carlyle).

387945,A1278WF1ZT2JUX,6303908586,Mr J,"[13, 18]","As a Catholic involved with ministry at the parish level for 15 years now, I can honestly say that this excellent little film captures the debilitating, guilt-laden, shame-based, destructive consequences of the  Roman institution and its priests. Though not all priests break their vows,  believe me...many do-- both heterosexually and, especially,  homosexually.Linus Roache portrays one such man caught in the crossfire  between his very real sex drive and his very real desire to serve God.  Director Antonia Bird does a good job of revealing Rome's celibacy law as  the outdated, damaging, psychologically sick imposition that it is. At the  same time, she does not glorify her priest's decision to break his vows,  and reveals that his illicit act has consequences.Robert Carlyle is great  as the little boyfriend...a real change from his later Trainspotting and  Full Monty roles. The film's subplot about family incest is another  opportunity for Bird to highlight the Catholic Church's long and  well-documented history of denial, cover-up, and silence in the face of a  male-oriented need to oppress.In every parish in which I have been involved  in ministry, I have witnessed plenty of priests whose policy is to keep  silent about anything that could be damaging to the Church or to one of its  prominent members.This seems to be a disease among Roman priests...silence;  the film captures that atmosphere of self-serving denial. It would be  useless for most Catholics to watch this film...they would fail to  understand its significance; let's face it,those who wander blindly among  the pews, rosaries in hand, would react with hatred and chagrin. However,  the film is heartbreakingly accurate and should be seen by anyone with  active intelligence. Only with the help of films like this can people begin  to throw out the evil, diseased structures that have been gripping the  Catholic faith for centuries. Lastly, if Antonia Bird directed this film  based upon her own personal experience of Catholicism, then BRAVO!

The film moves at an even pace and is done tastefully.  The movie poignantly shows both the burdens of faith and the burdens of the flesh.  When the title character, in a pivotal scene, refuses to administer the eucharist to one of his &quot;partners&quot;, the paradox becomes conundrum.  Even though the motivation behind this action appears immediate, I fully suggest watching this scene alone three or four times; only then will Linus Roaches' perfomance show the true nuance of subtle understanding which the actor seems to bring to the character.  This movie is worth owning for several reasons, not the least of which is its underlying tenet of truth.  But, issues such as religion, faith, spirituality are fluent concepts that everyone comes to their personal terms with through thIer own personal experiences.

I already dealt with the struggles of being gay and religious in the past, and I didn't think I'd find the topic of being a gay priest in the Catholic Church too interesting. I was definitely mistaken.This movie is a hidden gem from the mid 90s, taking place in Liverpool, England. Linus Roache did a wonderful job as Father Greg. He portrayed the character as flawed yet likable. His lover Graham (Robert Carlyle) was also equally great, and their kiss on the beach was one of the most passionate that I've seen in a film. Father Matthew (Tom Wilkinson) was also a wonderful character, showing that despite his religious role, he was rather open-minded, defending Father Greg multiple times against bishops of the Church and even homophobic members of the local parish.One of the biggest subplots was with the girl Lisa, who confessed to Father Greg that she was being molested by her father. Father Greg wanted to tell her mother, but he knew he couldn't break the Seal of the Confessional, an important sacrament in the Catholic Church. This was another turning point for his character, furthering his doubt about whether he was meant to be a priest. The storyline was powerful, and I'd say it was just as important a plot point as being gay in the Catholic Church.""Priest"" is one of the best movies I've seen about being gay and religious, and it showcased each identity with compassion. However, the movie was pretty critical against the Catholic Church, illustrating that their ideas are outdated such as Father Greg not being able to reveal Lisa's secret and help her.

The Catholic church hit the roof. And with good reason, too. The Church doesn't seem to get too nasty over bad films.Despite the fact that Antonia Bird has fallen permanently out of favor with this reviewer thanks to two hours of utterly wasted celluloid called Ravenous, she pulled off a wondrous little film here. Linus Roache stars as the title character, a conservative priest sent to a poor parish after the man he's replacing goes a little batty (and rams the bishop's door with the large cross over the church's altar, one of the most blissfully funny opening scenes I've ever encountered in a film). Roache's character, Greg Pilkington, is immediately at odds with the liberal priest who will be working alongside him, Matthew Thomas (Tom Wilkinson, one of many actors who wander in and out of this flick who appeared together again in The Full Monty). Fr. Thomas is a drinker, a lech, tends to look the other way about much in his parish, that sort of thing. Bird sets things up quite nicely as 'good priest comes in and reforms parish screwed up by bad priest.'Until, of course, Roache is confronted with two major disasters in a row&#8212;the revelation in confessional of a father's molestation of his daughter, and his own homosexuality. Pilkington suddenly finds himself in the midst of an on-again-off-again love-hate affair with Graham (Robert Carlyle) while simultaneously trying to figure out whether to break the seal of the confessional and call the police about the father who's molesting his kid. It's complicated stuff, And Fr. Pilkington reacts in the ways that most humans would, and the great human tragedy turns another page.All in all what I ended up comparing this to in my head time and again was Colors, Dennis Hopper's brilliant film about an idealistic cop (Sean Penn) who eventually comes to understand his partner (Robert Duvall)'s attitude towards life. Bird treats her characters and situations with the same, and similarly unexpected, subtlety that Hopper achieves. They're also both capped off with two of the finest ending scenes in the world of tragic cinema. I strongly suggest watching both, but I wouldn't recommend doing so on the same night. **** ",5,Dona eis requiem...,1385510400,"11 27, 2013",2013,2297,"['Priest', 'Antonia', 'Bird', '1994', '[', 'originally', 'posted', '16Oct2000', ']', 'What', 'flap', 'movie', 'caused', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'Catholic', 'church', 'hit', 'roof', 'good', 'reason', 'too', 'Church', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'too', 'nasty', 'bad', 'films.Despite', 'fact', 'Antonia', 'Bird', 'fallen', 'permanently', 'favor', 'reviewer', 'thanks', 'two', 'hours', 'utterly', 'wasted', 'celluloid', 'called', 'Ravenous', 'pulled', 'off', 'wondrous', 'little', 'film', 'here', 'Linus', 'Roache', 'title', 'character', 'conservative', 'priest', 'sent', 'poor', 'parish', 'man', 'replacing', 'little', 'batty', 'bishop', 'door', 'large', 'cross', 'church', 'altar', 'one', 'most', 'blissfully', 'funny', 'opening', 'scenes', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'encountered', 'film', 'Roache', 'character', 'Greg', 'Pilkington', 'immediately', 'odds', 'liberal', 'priest', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'working', 'Matthew', 'Thomas', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'one', 'many', 'actors', 'who', 'wander', 'flick', 'who', 'appeared', 'together', 'again', 'Full', 'Monty', 'Fr', 'Thomas', 'drinker', 'lech', 'look', 'other', 'way', 'much', 'parish', 'sort', 'thing', 'Bird', 'sets', 'things', 'up', 'quite', 'nicely', ""'good"", 'priest', 'reforms', 'parish', 'screwed', 'up', 'bad', 'priest', ""'Until"", 'course', 'Roache', 'confronted', 'two', 'major', 'disasters', 'row', '8212', 'revelation', 'confessional', 'father', 'molestation', 'daughter', 'own', 'homosexuality', 'Pilkington', 'suddenly', 'midst', 'on-again-off-again', 'love-hate', 'affair', 'Graham', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'simultaneously', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'break', 'seal', 'confessional', 'call', 'police', 'father', 'who', 'molesting', 'kid', 'complicated', 'stuff', 'Fr', 'Pilkington', 'ways', 'most', 'humans', 'would', 'great', 'human', 'tragedy', 'page.All', 'what', 'ended', 'up', 'comparing', 'head', 'time', 'again', 'was', 'Colors', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'brilliant', 'film', 'idealistic', 'cop', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'who', 'eventually', 'understand', 'partner', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'attitude', 'towards', 'life', 'Bird', 'characters', 'situations', 'same', 'similarly', 'unexpected', 'subtlety', 'Hopper', ""'re"", 'also', 'capped', 'off', 'two', 'finest', 'ending', 'scenes', 'world', 'tragic', 'cinema', 'strongly', 'suggest', 'watching', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'doing', 'so', 'same', 'night', '****']",Priest VHS

I loved it and wore the tape out over the years watching it on a regular basis and screening it for others. I wanted the DVD and it was difficult to find, but of course, Amazon came through and I got it quickly and at a great price. This British-made movie portrays the story of a gay priest in a poor parish who learns of a young girl who is being molested by her father. Due to the ""seal of the confessional"" he feels that he can not report this and struggles with the laws of the Catholic church regarding the child's situation. He is then exposed as a gay man and loses the respect of his congregation and eventually his appointment in the parish.

But with all that's going on in the Catholic church, a movie like ""Priest"" is even more vital now than ever.  In one of the most underrated performances ever, Linus Roache is Father Greg, who, upon being newly assigned to a British parish, gets caught in a web of drama involving child abuse, sexuality, the sacrament of Confession, and the priestly vow of celibacy.  Without revealing spoilers, ""Priest"" confronts some pretty throny issues lesser films would dodge.  It also has great performances from Academy Award nominee Tom Wilkinson (""In the Bedroom"") and Robert Carlyle, who shows not a trace of the frightening intensity he brought to his role in ""Trainspotting.""  The film borders on sentiment during a scene when they play ""You'll Never Walk Alone,"" but otherwise, it's a pretty solid affair.  While Miramax spends millions of dollars hyping to death more mainstream films like ""Chocolat"" and ""Cider House Rules,"" ""Priest"" gets the shaft on DVD.  There are virtually no features on this package.

This is not a feel good movie but it is a movie that inspires thought and it will draw you in and impact your emotions. It offers no easy answers and hits several issues hard.
