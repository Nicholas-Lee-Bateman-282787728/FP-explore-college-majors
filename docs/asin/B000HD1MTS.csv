1013030,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B000HD1MTS,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[5, 5]","You'll have to be quite agile to get the most of this excellent Perfect in 10 Yoga DVD. If you're really stiff, go for something easier. Even though you'll get benefit from working at your own level, it won't be as enjoyable. Susan Grant is marvelous, with a lovely soft voice that adds to the relaxation of these workouts, and she really understands the flow of how to put the movements together to make for a perfect 10 minute session. Ultra slender, lithe and limber, Susan can bend her legs like a pretzel, and is a marvel to watch.The 4 sessions make a super start to your morning, but would also be good as an early afternoon ""pick me up,"" in that 2 PM hour that tends to be the hardest to get through. Especially #3, which has the ""Cobra"" pose, which is meant to stimulate the body and mind. #3 is my favorite, with the other 3 workouts kept for variety, to keep the exercise program fresh, and my body used to the other movements.There is deep stretching in these movements that you can feel to the core of your body, and it feels great! This is very much authentic yoga, not watered down and mixed with other systems of exercise. Other than the 4 workouts, there is a Welcome that is an overview of the workouts, with some added pointers and good suggestions like being ""conscious of the presence while you breathe,"" and there is a wonderful 5 minute Deep Relaxation meditation/resting poses to end with. Well produced in the lovely bare studio of the Morocco Academy of Middle Eastern Dance in NYC, the music adds to the serenity and is by various artists, including Karl Kalbaugh and Chee Wei Tay.",5,"Stretch, Relax, Energize",1237507200,"03 20, 2009",2009,1608,"[""'ll"", 'have', 'be', 'quite', 'agile', 'get', 'most', 'excellent', 'Perfect', '10', 'Yoga', 'DVD', ""'re"", 'really', 'stiff', 'go', 'something', 'easier', 'Even', ""'ll"", 'get', 'benefit', 'working', 'own', 'level', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'enjoyable', 'Susan', 'Grant', 'marvelous', 'lovely', 'soft', 'voice', 'relaxation', 'workouts', 'really', 'flow', 'how', 'put', 'movements', 'together', 'make', 'perfect', '10', 'minute', 'session', 'Ultra', 'slender', 'lithe', 'limber', 'Susan', 'can', 'bend', 'legs', 'pretzel', 'marvel', 'watch.The', '4', 'sessions', 'make', 'super', 'start', 'morning', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'good', 'early', 'afternoon', 'pick', 'up', '2', 'PM', 'hour', 'be', 'hardest', 'get', 'Especially', '3', 'Cobra', 'pose', 'meant', 'stimulate', 'body', 'mind', '3', 'favorite', 'other', '3', 'workouts', 'kept', 'variety', 'keep', 'exercise', 'program', 'fresh', 'body', 'used', 'other', 'movements.There', 'deep', 'stretching', 'movements', 'can', 'feel', 'core', 'body', 'great', 'very', 'much', 'authentic', 'yoga', 'not', 'watered', 'down', 'mixed', 'other', 'systems', 'exercise', 'Other', '4', 'workouts', 'Welcome', 'overview', 'workouts', 'added', 'pointers', 'good', 'suggestions', 'being', 'conscious', 'presence', 'breathe', 'wonderful', '5', 'minute', 'Deep', 'Relaxation', 'meditation/resting', 'poses', 'end', 'Well', 'produced', 'lovely', 'bare', 'studio', 'Morocco', 'Academy', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'Dance', 'NYC', 'music', 'serenity', 'various', 'artists', 'including', 'Karl', 'Kalbaugh', 'Chee', 'Wei', 'Tay']","Perfect in Ten: Yoga, 10-minute Workouts"

I liked the idea of 10-minute sessions, but the teacher was boring in her instruction, and sometimes, the poses emphasized flexibility with no modifications. There are much better DVDs out there.

It has 4 sections.Section 1: Begins lying down with conscious breathing. Roll up to standing with half salutes. Side stretches.  Full salutes, about 4.Section 2: Chair pose, yogic pushups, warrior 1, 2, triangle, extended side angle, twists, abs leg lifts, yogic squat.Section 3: Moving bridge pose, bridge with hands clasped or upward facing bow, bow pose, locust pose, child's pose to slight back bend in rock pose. Camel pose.Section 4: supine leg stretches, twists, one legged seated stretches, cows face pose, pigeon, deep relaxation.All in all a good, simple yoga program.  My only complaint and the 4 stars rating is the music which was obtrusive, at time.  Otherwise a very nice addition to my yoga library.
