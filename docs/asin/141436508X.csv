169538,A2CNGARED6OWWU,141436508X,"Bluerose's Heart ""Bluerose's Heart""","[0, 0]","Overall, I really enjoyed watching Journey to Christmas! I would be thrilled to walk where Jesus walked and sit where He taught. That would be an amazing experience! I don't have any plans to travel to Israel, though. I'm not saying I won't, but it's not in the works anytime soon. That's why I'm so glad I was able to experience a tiny bit of the Nativity Story through my TV screen.In Journey to Christmas we meet 5 people with various backgrounds and faiths who take the trip to Israel to learn more about the Nativity Story for different reasons. I hate to say, even though I did like the series, I could have did without the ""reality show"" part of it. Sometimes the people just annoyed me, and I felt too much time was spent on watching them play and talk. Most of the ""5"" were traveling to Israel to decide if they believed in Jesus or not. One was going for artistic inspiration. It just annoyed me! And, I hate that they were constantly referred to as ""modern-day wise men"". I would have loved to have seen more educational type content. I LOVED watching the history part of the video. If you already know a great deal of background information about the Nativity Story, then I have a feeling you'll be a bit disappointed. It is just basic information about the customs of the times, but parts were still fascinating to me. I don't really get how it's being advertised as a church curriculum type of video, though. I think most people will want to watch this video to have a better connection to Jesus and His birth. While that does happen, I just don't think the spiritual content will be what most are hoping for.There was one particular part that I really liked. The girls were learning how to season olives. They were with a few women from Israel, and you could tell how peaceful they were. One of the girls(part of the 5) mentioned how overloaded we are. We've constantly got cell phones ringing and computers in front of us. The women in Israel kept their hands busy, but they're hearts and minds were at peace. It just really made me think. There were times when I completely disagreed with what one of the ""5"" were saying, and there were times when I absolutely agreed with what they were saying.Just in case this would bother you, I want to mention some of the paintings that are shown. There's a couple of nude-ish paintings, but one is shown over and over. Each episode is 45 minutes long. This apparently aired on television first, because there's obvious ""commercial"" breaks(without the commercials, though). Due to those breaks and the fact that there are 4 separate episodes, there's a good bit of repetition. One picture shows up several times due to all that, though. I didn't study the paintings or anything(I actually tried to ignore them for the most part), but I think a woman's top is the only actual nudity shown. I think the rest is pretty well covered up.I'm thrilled to have Journey to Christmas as part of our DVD library. I just wish it wasn't set up as a reality show type of thing. While I do think that you'll have plenty of issues with the video while watching it, I definitely think it IS worth watching, though!*Thanks to Tyndale for providing me a review copy in exchange for my honest opinion.",3,I really liked the educational part!,1322697600,"12 1, 2011",2011,3237,"['Overall', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'Journey', 'Christmas', 'would', 'be', 'thrilled', 'walk', 'where', 'Jesus', 'walked', 'sit', 'where', 'taught', 'would', 'be', 'amazing', 'experience', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'plans', 'travel', 'Israel', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'wo', ""n't"", 'not', 'works', 'anytime', 'soon', 'why', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'was', 'able', 'experience', 'tiny', 'bit', 'Nativity', 'Story', 'TV', 'screen.In', 'Journey', 'Christmas', 'meet', '5', 'people', 'various', 'backgrounds', 'faiths', 'who', 'take', 'trip', 'Israel', 'learn', 'more', 'Nativity', 'Story', 'different', 'reasons', 'hate', 'say', 'even', 'did', 'series', 'could', 'have', 'did', 'reality', 'show', 'part', 'people', 'just', 'annoyed', 'felt', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'was', 'spent', 'watching', 'play', 'talk', 'Most', '5', 'were', 'traveling', 'Israel', 'decide', 'believed', 'Jesus', 'not', 'One', 'was', 'going', 'artistic', 'inspiration', 'just', 'annoyed', 'hate', 'were', 'constantly', 'referred', 'modern-day', 'wise', 'men', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'educational', 'type', 'content', 'LOVED', 'watching', 'history', 'part', 'video', 'already', 'know', 'great', 'deal', 'background', 'information', 'Nativity', 'Story', 'then', 'have', 'feeling', ""'ll"", 'be', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'just', 'basic', 'information', 'customs', 'times', 'parts', 'were', 'still', 'fascinating', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'how', 'being', 'advertised', 'church', 'curriculum', 'type', 'video', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'want', 'watch', 'video', 'have', 'better', 'connection', 'Jesus', 'birth', 'happen', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'spiritual', 'content', 'will', 'be', 'what', 'most', 'are', 'hoping', 'for.There', 'was', 'one', 'particular', 'part', 'really', 'liked', 'girls', 'were', 'learning', 'how', 'season', 'olives', 'were', 'few', 'women', 'Israel', 'could', 'tell', 'how', 'peaceful', 'were', 'One', 'girls', 'part', '5', 'mentioned', 'how', 'overloaded', 'are', ""'ve"", 'constantly', 'got', 'cell', 'phones', 'ringing', 'computers', 'front', 'women', 'Israel', 'kept', 'hands', 'busy', ""'re"", 'hearts', 'minds', 'were', 'peace', 'just', 'really', 'made', 'think', 'were', 'times', 'when', 'completely', 'disagreed', 'what', 'one', '5', 'were', 'saying', 'were', 'times', 'when', 'absolutely', 'agreed', 'what', 'were', 'saying.Just', 'case', 'would', 'bother', 'want', 'mention', 'paintings', 'are', 'shown', 'couple', 'nude-ish', 'paintings', 'one', 'shown', 'over', 'episode', '45', 'minutes', 'long', 'apparently', 'aired', 'television', 'first', 'obvious', 'commercial', 'breaks', 'commercials', 'though', 'Due', 'breaks', 'fact', 'are', '4', 'separate', 'episodes', 'good', 'bit', 'repetition', 'One', 'picture', 'up', 'several', 'times', 'due', 'did', ""n't"", 'study', 'paintings', 'anything', 'actually', 'tried', 'ignore', 'most', 'part', 'think', 'woman', 'top', 'only', 'actual', 'nudity', 'shown', 'think', 'rest', 'pretty', 'well', 'covered', 'up.I', ""'m"", 'thrilled', 'have', 'Journey', 'Christmas', 'part', 'DVD', 'library', 'just', 'wish', 'was', ""n't"", 'set', 'up', 'reality', 'show', 'type', 'thing', 'do', 'think', ""'ll"", 'have', 'plenty', 'issues', 'video', 'watching', 'definitely', 'think', 'worth', 'watching', '*Thanks', 'Tyndale', 'providing', 'review', 'copy', 'exchange', 'honest', 'opinion']",N/A

What better way to learn the true meaning of Christmas than to watch Biblical scholar, Nizar Shaheen lead a small group of individuals through the Holy Land to trace the steps of Jesus's birth.

The viewers feel as if they are also there and they can be a part of the most wonderful experience ever.  A sweet reminder to all of us to remember to celebrate the birth of our King not only on the Holiday but everyday of the year.

169540,A2MMDV260HV1PZ,141436508X,Jill H.,"[0, 0]","""Journey to Christmas"" is a 4-episode series that explains the real meaning of Christmas as five people from very different backgrounds are taken on a journey through Israel. While in Israel the participants visit places that mark the history of the birth of Jesus. This series will make many people rethink the story of how Jesus' birth happened and discover what life was like in Israel during that time. As the series progresses, viewers will start to notice whether the journey to Israel has had an impact on the lives of the participants and whether they are glad they have left their lives back home to be a part of the journey.""Journey to Christmas"" seems like a holy version of a reality series to me, and I hope that more reality series will be made that focus on the life of Jesus and other Biblical characters. It was fascinating to be able to discover that some people in Israel celebrate Christmas as I watched the five participants celebrate it with people in Nazareth. I have discovered from sharing about this series with others that people are very interested in learning more about the real meaning of Christmas, and this series is an educational tool that will help many people gain a deeper understanding of it. This series also expanded my thinking beyond stories I had been told in Sunday school, Bible study classes, and sermons about the birth of Jesus.This is a series that I believe will impact both adults and children who have a hunger for learning more about the story of Jesus' birth and about the places that surrounded the story of His birth. I highly recommend it because it will expand some people's thinking beyond what they have been taught through stories about Jesus' birth and through their culture.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received a complimentary copy of this DVD episode series from Tyndale Publishing as part of their Blogger Review Program.

One is clearly a Christian; the other four are what I would call skeptics or seekers.Here is my opinion of the series:Pros:- The photography and visuals of the DVD are simply stunning. It is a high end production that is very professional and well made.- As a tour of the Holy Land, this film hits the mark. It was fascinating to see the home land of Jesus and get a taste of the culture, geography, and people of the region.Cons:- While having a lot of information about the culture, the film definitely lacked any solid spiritual content and a lot of the information given by the quoted ""experts"" was either slanted or guesswork and not scripturally accurate.- This is really a Holy Land tour with a ""reality TV format"" that was quite irritating to me. The constant dialog of the two men trying to decide if they had any good feelings about Christmas wore thin after a while and there was never any attempt to answer their questions with solid scriptural teachings.- Way too much repetition and backtracking to hold the interest of the audience. Too much time wasted on the babblings of the non-believers to make it a true competitor in the Christian market. This is definitely more secular in content than anything else.With it being advertised as a church study series I fully expected an uplifting program designed to bring the viewer to an understanding of Jesus as the Son of God. It contains very little in the way of teachings about the true meaning of Christmas and is more about the perspective of people who don't know what they believe. I just have to ask--why produce a program geared to the Christian audience that does not boldly proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ and how to have a salvation experience? If this is the best teaching that the church can produce, then it is very discouraging.Bottom line--If the objective of this film is (as I thought) to bring people closer to God and point them to the cross, then it has failed miserably. But if it is only to have an open debate on the existence of God in a secular discussion, then it has met its objective.I received this complimentary copy from Tyndale House Publishers for this review.

I really enjoyed all of the scenery and information of the Holy Land.Five different people from five different backgrounds got to go. They were a messianic Jew, a First Nations woman, a poet, a Christian radio personality, and an agnostic lawyer. All of them were either raised in a Christian home or had the opportunity to go to church. They all knew about the Christian faith.The three women to me seemed to get more out of their trip than the two men. I can't believe someone who has been raised in a Christian home or know about Christ gets to go to the Holy Land and they still don't believe. To me it seemed like the trip for the two men Drew and Rory was just a waste of time. They wanted some kind of sign or a big miracle.So would I recommend this DVD? Yes, for the three girls and they faith and love of the Lord and all of the beautiful places they visited.
