The villain in this movie is the main character's stepdad who runs a puppymill and abuses the dogs-- Breeds them when they're sick, things like that. There are no scenes of puppy violence. For comic relief you have the bumbling dog catchers who Benji outsmarts at every turn.",4,good,1268352000,"03 12, 2010",2010,354,"['very', 'cute', 'movie', 'not', '2', 'year', 'old', 'Excellent', 'older', 'kids', 'though', 'villain', 'movie', 'main', 'character', 'stepdad', 'who', 'puppymill', 'dogs', 'Breeds', 'when', ""'re"", 'sick', 'things', 'are', 'scenes', 'puppy', 'violence', 'comic', 'relief', 'have', 'bumbling', 'dog', 'catchers', 'who', 'Benji', 'outsmarts', 'turn']",N/A
835618,A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY,B0002IQEDM,"David A. Dein ""passafist""","[6, 12]","I took less than detailed notes when sitting through BENJI: OFF THE LEASH. But one of the last things I wrote was a small one word review. I wrote ""PUCK."" I meant ""PUKE"". But it was dark, so sue me.Have you ever gone to movie that was geared for kids and after watching it you had that sick feeling in your stomach. Sure on the surface it seemed okay. But underneath, its actual message is dark and brooding.Well, here it is BENJI: OFF THE LEASH, a film about a bunch of adorable animals that is actually about animal abuse and a dysfunctional family about to collapse.BENJI: OFF THE LEASH tells the story of two dogs neither of which is named Benji, a smart-aleck boy named Colby, his sociopathic father, his mentally withdrawn mother, a nutty old guy who talks to himself and dogs to a degree that seems unhealthy, and two bumbling dog catchers with hearts of gold. It's a lot of people and most of them are not connected.You see Colby is a boy whose family is on the verge of collapse. His Dad is emotionally abusive. His mother just wants Colby to stop aggravating Dad. It seems Dad, who drinks (but you'd never know it cause in the course of the movie he only drinks two beers, even though the garbage can is full of them) beat his wife and Colby, and yet they still live there. Dad's also a rare dog breeder.When Colby steels one of the rare dogs to save her, she mates with a mutt, and then give birth to""Puppy."" When Puppy's mother gets sick Puppy tries to rescue her from Colby's dad with the help of Lizard-Tongue, another stray in the neighborhood. Let the adorable adventures of Puppy and Lizard-Tongue commence.I'll be the first to admit I'm not really the right person to review afilm like this. But I did enjoy BENJI: THE HUNTED when I was a little boy. I still think it's one of the better animal films ever made. HUNTED's charm was the fact that BENJI, was a real dog. He didn't talk like the other adorable animals that've graced the silver screen and yet he had the same emotional attachment to his young audience.In fact the strongest moments of OFF THE LEASH are the moments when the dogs are relating to each other. These moments feel masterful as the camera photographs these animals with some emotion and a lot of humanity.Director (also writer, producer, and actor) Joe Camp loves animals. In fact every dog that has ever portrayed Benji has been a stray, rescued from a local area animal shelter. It's amazing that these dogs, many of which were abused or abandoned can be rescued and trained to work like pros. The film is at it best when he allows the camera to linger on the dogs and times barks so that we get a sense that they are talking. Those moments feel like old Silent movies. Camp actually allows the picture to tell the story, not dialogue. He also utilizes a nice musical soundtrack that helps move the action along and is about 80 percent of the time not distracting.Where the movie goes way wrong is the human aspect. Every singlecharacter is badly drawn. They spout inane dialogue and are emotional retards. The very first thing Colby's dad does is throw Puppy across the room. (If you have an aversion to animal cruelty in any form I'd stay away from the film). So of course he's a jerk from minute one. He's so Jerky it's amazing that he's married and has a child. Honestly, the guy doesn't talk to anyone. He yells at people, a lot.His character is so evil that it puts this weird, eerie darkness over the film. It's a strange portrait of a dysfunctional family. But the film still tries to play to the young crowd so on the surface there is this odd comedic tone. I think it's because the film human characters are stuck in a screenplay that is has very little subtlety. Making the characters feel unnatural and silly, instead of thoughtful and human.The film is being sold as a film about two adorable stray dogs trying to rescue their mother from the clutches of an evil dog breeder. But the film is really about how child abuse leads to animal abuse and will leave the adults in the room a real feeling of dread inside. To try and cover up this feeling, two stupid Dog Catchers and a guy, who looks like Santa Clause and talks like an inspirational calendar or greeting card are brought in the lighten things up. But they just seem to complicate the films narrative.Will the film play to its intended audience? No, the worst part of this film is that it's boring. There is no life or color where the humans are concerned and they fill up most of this movie's 90 minute running time. Kids may watch it for a little while, maybe even be enchanted by the Dogs, but about 30 minutes in they'll be screaming to go home. My suggestion to the BENJI production team: Why not a series of shorts for the Disney channel or something, involving the dogs only? Kids will love it and you can stay away from writing stupid screenplay's involving stupid people.BENJI: OFF THE LEASH was obviously made with lots of love and concern for abused and abandoned dogs all over the country. It wears its message right out in the open. It's just a shame the movie fails to charm or even entertain.",2,When Dog's Have More Humanity Than Humans!,1092614400,"08 16, 2004",2004,5122,"['took', 'less', 'detailed', 'notes', 'when', 'sitting',

I couldn't have been more wrong.  First of all, the father in the movie is a dog breeder who is not only abusive to his dogs, but his wife and son as well.  In one scene in the movie, the father, mother and son are at the police station.  While they are there, the police officer pushes back the mother's hair, exposing a bruise on her forehead.  While abuse is certainly a disturbing reality for some families today, the topic does not belong in a family movie that is likely to be viewed by young children.

Sure, the dogs are cute. But I think probably most dogs on this planet are cute, and that alone does not make a good family picture. You may think `Benji: Off the Leash!' is a film about Benji. Yes, it is, but it also includes several things that almost made me stop watching it.A kind boy named Colby (Nick Whitaker) secretly keeps an abandoned dog who tries to rescue his ailing mother ill-treated by her cruel owner. If you think this is a good story (and it is, I agree), wait a minute. The dog is abandoned by Colby's own abusive and malicious father who tosses away the puppy in the opening. The same cold-blooded daddy treats badly Benji's mother too in order to get more puppies! (Oh, I forgot to say he is a dog breeder, and he needs money!) And beating someone is also suggested....OK, I admit this film is made with good intention. It makes a good point about our society, where animal abuse is often deeply related to another type of abuse. But I thought this is a film about dogs, or adventures of these lovely dogs running around, and the film's DVD cover strongly suggests that kind of content. Of course, these serious issues could be in films made for kids, but here's another problem.That is, the film's terrible script that is confusing and often pointless. There is another dog abandoned by an unknown driver. The film could have explored the friendship between them, but before it does, it strays into several silly slapsticks by two Animal Control officers (with such old gags as falling in the mud). The rambling story goes nowhere, and the social issues like animal abuse is clumsily treated. The lazy pace of the film with this kind of unnecessary comedies by stupid characters not only kills everything that could have been much better lessons for kid, but also conceals the real merits of watching this film, that is, watching cute dogs.In short, we don't need this entry while we have the original Benji, and many other films from Disney, Pixar, and other studios, which the kids probably would find funnier and more educational.",2,Stick to the Original Benji; This May Not Exactly Be a Family Film,1163203200,"11 11, 2006",2006,2219,"[""'re"", 'looking', 'family', 'picture', 'something', 'cheerful', 'joyful', 'would', 'make', 'smile', 'laugh', 'should', 'see', 'other', 'Benji', 'films', 'not', 'one', 'Sure', 'dogs', 'are', 'cute', 'think', 'probably', 'most', 'dogs', 'planet', 'are', 'cute', 'alone', 'not', 'make', 'good', 'family', 'picture', 'may', 'think', 'Benji', 'Leash', 'film', 'Benji', 'Yes', 'also', 'several', 'things', 'almost', 'made', 'stop', 'watching', 'it.A', 'kind', 'boy', 'named', 'Colby', 'Nick', 'Whitaker', 'secretly', 'abandoned', 'dog', 'who', 'rescue', 'ailing', 'mother', 'ill-treated', 'cruel', 'owner', 'think', 'good', 'story', 'agree', 'wait', 'minute', 'dog', 'abandoned', 'Colby', 'own', 'abusive', 'malicious', 'father', 'who', 'away', 'puppy', 'opening', 'same', 'cold-blooded', 'daddy', 'treats', 'badly', 'Benji', 'mother', 'too', 'order', 'get', 'more', 'puppies', 'Oh', 'forgot', 'say', 'dog', 'breeder', 'money', 'beating', 'someone', 'also', 'suggested', '.OK', 'admit', 'film', 'made', 'good', 'intention', 'good', 'point', 'society', 'where', 'animal', 'abuse', 'often', 'deeply', 'related', 'type', 'abuse', 'thought', 'film', 'dogs', 'adventures', 'lovely', 'dogs', 'running', 'around', 'film', 'DVD', 'cover', 'strongly', 'kind', 'content', 'course', 'serious', 'issues', 'could', 'be', 'films', 'made', 'kids', 'here', 'problem.That', 'film', 'terrible', 'script', 'confusing', 'often', 'pointless', 'dog', 'abandoned', 'unknown', 'driver', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'explored', 'friendship', 'several', 'silly', 'slapsticks', 'two', 'Animal', 'Control', 'officers', 'such', 'old', 'gags', 'falling', 'mud', 'rambling', 'story', 'nowhere', 'social', 'issues', 'animal', 'abuse', 'clumsily', 'treated', 'lazy', 'pace', 'film', 'kind', 'unnecessary', 'comedies', 'stupid', 'characters', 'not', 'only', 'everything', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'lessons', 'kid', 'also', 'real', 'merits', 'watching', 'film', 'watching', 'cute', 'dogs.In', 'short', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'entry', 'have', 'original', 'Benji', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'Disney', 'Pixar', 'other', 'studios', 'kids', 'probably', 'would', 'find', 'funnier', 'more', 'educational']",N/A
