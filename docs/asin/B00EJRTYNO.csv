1667467,A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ,B00EJRTYNO,Kasey G,"[3, 3]","Kudos to VEI for finally resurrecting THE MOD SQUAD on DVD. After two seasons/four volumes were released in 2007-2009, CBS abandoned this iconic psychadelic relic and left us hanging with some of the best MOD moments yet to come.While the picture quality isn't as stellar here as it was on the CBS releases, the show has never looked this good on television before despite the presence of minor dirt and debris here and there. They even included the original opening bumpers ""The Mod Squad: In Color"", so purists will be delighted.My only complaint is that the actual cover art is different from what is shown here on Amazon--and it isn't as nice IMO and looks rather low-res compared to the CBS releases. But who am I kidding? I'd buy this in a plain brown wrapper because the shows are what I want!
