When she walks across the screen TOPLESS, your whole life flashes before your eyes.  I mean, she is spectacular.  You're in love from that point on, and all you can think about is wanting to have her baby.I bought the Season One disks for the sole reason of seeing again the skit in Episode 2 about an epic fail in TV censorship.  The sound editor begins letting swear words through and beeping out other words, a naked man in the scene has his entire body pixilated except for his genitals, and the black rectangular box that is supposed to keep a woman's breasts covered can't keep up with her when she moves, thus exposing the most incredible breasts that I, or you, have ever seen.  Yes, I bought the whole thing just for that brief skit, and it was worth every penny.Only 4 stars because Funny or Die is very often not funny at all.  They will take a funny idea and hammer on it until you begin to feel sorry for it.  Some things are only funny in passing, FOD, for maybe 5 seconds.  After 5 minutes, it's not humor anymore, it's cruel and unusual punishment.",4,Megan Henry makes Season One worth having,1302048000,"04 6, 2011",2011,1175,"['Megan', 'Henry', 'pretty', 'funny', 'smart', 'When', 'screen', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'eyes', 'When', 'screen', 'TOPLESS', 'whole', 'life', 'flashes', 'eyes', 'mean', 'spectacular', ""'re"", 'love', 'point', 'can', 'think', 'wanting', 'have', 'baby.I', 'bought', 'Season', 'One', 'sole', 'reason', 'seeing', 'again', 'skit', 'Episode', '2', 'epic', 'fail', 'TV', 'censorship', 'sound', 'editor', 'letting', 'swear', 'words', 'beeping', 'out', 'other', 'words', 'naked', 'man', 'scene', 'entire', 'body', 'pixilated', 'genitals', 'black', 'rectangular', 'box', 'supposed', 'keep', 'woman', 'breasts', 'covered', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'up', 'when', 'thus', 'exposing', 'most', 'incredible', 'breasts', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Yes', 'bought', 'whole', 'thing', 'just', 'brief', 'skit', 'was', 'worth', 'penny.Only', '4', 'stars', 'Funny', 'Die', 'very', 'often', 'not', 'funny', 'will', 'take', 'funny', 'idea', 'hammer', 'begin', 'feel', 'sorry', 'things', 'are', 'only', 'funny', 'passing', 'FOD', 'maybe', '5', 'seconds', '5', 'minutes', 'not', 'humor', 'anymore', 'cruel', 'unusual', 'punishment']",Funny or Die Presents: Season 1

I nearly avoided it on the strength of that alone... sounds like desperation. Unfortunately, some of it looks like desperation too. There are sketches on here so bad that they'd look amateurish on Youtube. If you knew the people who'd uploaded them you'd feel embarrassed for them. But, there is some sublime weirdness.

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[7, 29]","When comedian Will Ferrell created the web site ""Funny or Die"" a few years ago, it sometimes had clever skits or short films. If you didn't like one - or found it not to your liking - you could hit the ""stop"" button on the FoD video player on your PC. But there was no cost.Ferrell and company decided to take the concept to the next level and created a cable TV series for HBO. The first season had 12 episodes. Now the ""Complete First Season"" is on DVD. I never watched the TV show, so this was my first exposure to it. I had great hopes but was sorely disappointed. Each of the `approximately 230 minute"" episodes begins with an announcer who introduces the show. It looks like something from the early days of ""The Groove Tube"" or ""The Kentucky Fried Movie"", a comedy film of short skits which preceded Saturday Night Live in the 1960s. Those were ground breaking films and - while they tried to ""push the buttons"", they were in unchartered territory. Now satirical skits are everywhere. We have SNL, In Living Color, Mad TV and more.I found very few of these skits funny and some of them repeat themselves (""Playground Politics"", ""Casual Sex"" and - if those concepts weren't funny the first time, they wren't the second time either.If you are into ""shock"" comedy (visuals or language) you MIGHT enjoy some of these. Look for a few samples on the FoD page. But this is the first HBO DVD I watched in 2010 that I found boring and useless (they released some classics in 2010.). Humor is personal taste. This one just didn't make it for me.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",1,"Sadly - for me - this was ""Not Funny"" and  ""dumb (and boring)""",1293840000,"01 1, 2011",2011,1575,"['When', 'comedian', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'created', 'web', 'site', 'Funny', 'Die', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'sometimes', 'had', 'clever', 'skits', 'short', 'films', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'one', 'found', 'not', 'liking', 'could', 'hit', 'stop', 'button', 'FoD', 'video', 'player', 'PC', 'was', 'cost.Ferrell', 'company', 'decided', 'take', 'concept', 'next', 'level', 'created', 'cable', 'TV', 'series', 'HBO', 'first', 'season', 'had', '12', 'episodes', 'Now', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'DVD', 'never', 'watched', 'TV', 'show', 'was', 'first', 'exposure', 'had', 'great', 'hopes', 'was', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'approximately', '230', 'minute', 'episodes', 'announcer', 'who', 'show', 'something', 'early', 'days', 'Groove', 'Tube', 'Kentucky', 'Fried', 'Movie', 'comedy', 'film', 'short', 'skits', 'preceded', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', '1960s', 'were', 'ground', 'breaking', 'films', 'tried', 'push', 'buttons', 'were', 'unchartered', 'territory', 'Now', 'satirical', 'skits', 'are', 'everywhere', 'have', 'SNL', 'Living', 'Color', 'Mad', 'TV', 'more.I', 'found', 'very', 'few', 'skits', 'funny', 'repeat', 'Playground', 'Politics', 'Casual', 'Sex', 'concepts', 'were', ""n't"", 'funny', 'first', 'time', 'wre', ""n't"", 'second', 'time', 'either.If', 'are', 'shock', 'comedy', 'visuals', 'language', 'MIGHT', 'enjoy', 'Look', 'few', 'samples', 'FoD', 'page', 'first', 'HBO', 'DVD', 'watched', '2010', 'found', 'boring', 'useless', 'released', 'classics', '2010.', 'Humor', 'personal', 'taste', 'one', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'me.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",Funny or Die Presents: Season 1
1384159,A3D6KZT0QG6UKB,B00439GDQ4,"Tim Lieder ""Founder of Dybbuk Press""","[3, 6]","One can almost admire the Funny or Die people for creating a comedy show that lacks some of the essentials of comedy - like laughs. Apparently Zach Galifianakis is hilarious when he dresses up like a little girl and stares at the camera as if he's a child molester seeking a babysitting job. Apparently Tim and Eric are funny for looking fat. Even more encouraging is the fact that the show will take one particular skit, bomb and then keep doing it on the theory that if you tell a lie long enough that you can make it funny. Skits like ""Designated Driver"" where Rob Riggle acts like a drunken lout, ""The Adventures of David and Jenny"" where two people act really stupid are just a few of the skits that just keep showing new chapters throughout the show. At least with SNL, the lame skit was once funny so people could remember liking Church Lady or Goat Boy before they saw it a billions times. With FOD, the thing just starts out lame and stupid and stays that way.And then there are skits that go on forever - like the 1000 Cats one. Apparently there are a lot of people on youtube that think that a guy singing about Cats like an Andrew Lloyd Weber remake for 17 minutes is hilarious with every minute being that much better. This proves the theory that people who post comments on youtube are idiots. In fact, it's a skit in which thejoke is obvious from the first second and then just gets tedious and never ever becomes funny.However, there are some ok skits. Space Baby is cute. The one about the pregnant woman who wants to have sex a few weeks before she gives birth is creepy fun. Playground Politics with a big fat kid playing America who runs around pushing the other kids around (even North Korea who is just too crazy to not hold lit fireworks) is almost amusing. And drunk history with intoxicated people relating history has an audacious quality that almost makes up for it not being funny.HOwever, for the most part you are stuck with skits about people acting drunk and ""whacky"" and genital mutilation.",2,One or two amusing skits do not mitigate the tedious bits,1303084800,"04 18, 2011",2011,2023,"['One', 'can', 'almost', 'admire', 'Funny', 'Die', 'people', 'creating', 'comedy', 'show', 'essentials', 'comedy', 'laughs', 'Apparently', 'Zach', 'Galifianakis', 'hilarious', 'when', 'up', 'little', 'girl', 'stares', 'camera', 'child', 'molester', 'seeking', 'babysitting', 'job', 'Apparently', 'Tim', 'Eric', 'are', 'funny', 'looking', 'fat', 'Even', 'more', 'encouraging', 'fact', 'show', 'will', 'take', 'one', 'particular', 'skit', 'bomb', 'then', 'keep', 'doing', 'theory', 'tell', 'lie', 'long', 'enough', 'can', 'make', 'funny', 'Skits', 'Designated', 'Driver', 'where', 'Rob', 'Riggle', 'drunken', 'lout', 'Adventures', 'David', 'Jenny', 'where', 'two', 'people', 'act', 'really', 'stupid', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'skits', 'just', 'keep', 'showing', 'new', 'chapters', 'show', 'least', 'SNL', 'lame', 'skit', 'was', 'once', 'funny', 'people', 'could', 'remember', 'liking', 'Church', 'Lady', 'Goat', 'Boy', 'saw', 'billions', 'times', 'FOD', 'thing', 'just', 'out', 'lame', 'stupid', 'way.And', 'then', 'are', 'skits', 'go', 'forever', '1000', 'Cats', 'one', 'Apparently', 'are', 'lot', 'people', 'youtube', 'think', 'guy', 'singing', 'Cats', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Weber', 'remake', '17', 'minutes', 'hilarious', 'minute', 'being', 'much', 'better', 'theory', 'people', 'who', 'post', 'comments', 'youtube', 'are', 'idiots', 'fact', 'skit', 'thejoke', 'obvious', 'first', 'second', 'then', 'just', 'tedious', 'never', 'ever', 'funny.However', 'are', 'ok', 'skits', 'Space', 'Baby', 'cute', 'one', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'who', 'have', 'sex', 'few', 'weeks', 'birth', 'creepy', 'fun', 'Politics', 'big', 'fat', 'kid', 'playing', 'America', 'who', 'pushing', 'other', 'kids', 'even', 'North', 'Korea', 'who', 'just', 'too', 'crazy', 'not', 'hold', 'lit', 'fireworks', 'almost', 'amusing', 'drunk', 'history', 'intoxicated', 'people', 'relating', 'history', 'audacious', 'quality', 'almost', 'up', 'not', 'being', 'funny.HOwever', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'stuck', 'skits', 'people', 'acting', 'drunk', 'whacky', 'genital', 'mutilation']",Funny or Die Presents: Season 1
