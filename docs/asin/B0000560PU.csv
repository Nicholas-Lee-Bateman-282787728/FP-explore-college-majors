Unfortunately, I was left dumbfounded that so many people could like such a trite and flimsy film.  All the characters (save for one) are one dimensional and completely described by their sexuality.  All the sterotypes are coverd too (the pretty boy who knows he is, the druggie, the queeny black man, etc).  Is this a bad thing?  Not if you're going for strict comedy, which this does, but it also pretends to make 'important', 'insightful', 'meaingful' statements about gay relationships.  None of which hasn't been said before or we haven't heard a million times in hetro themed films.  There are a few good gags spread through out, but I found most of it's humor silly and uninspired.  Overall it reminds me of a bad episode of &quot;Sex in the City&quot;.  I recognise it's progress that this film can even be made, I just wish it truly deserved it's praise as a good film and not just an important one.The DVD has a directors commentary (that can't stop stating how 'strong' and 'well written' the script is), trailers and deleted scenes (also with commentary).

568373,A1WJRDNGOCLXHP,B0000560PU,Charles Harrington,"[2, 2]","Obviously this movie does not depict the experience of every gay man in America, no movie ever has or could do that.  This movie does show a group of friends in LA dealing with life, love, and all the other stuff and having a fairly good time of it.  It shows how life can be hard and lonely and confusing but as a people we tend to be able to pull together to see it through.  The Carpenters ""tragic happy song"" analogy in the film is a good one.I think that people who find the film demeaning aren't paying careful attention.  While the movie does show men sleeping around, being shallow, and having issues it does not glorify these pastimes.  As a matter of fact it shows some of the troubles we encounte if we become too self obsessed or devisive or don't care who we hurt.  The film doesn't pander to stereotypes it builds genuine characters.  To call Taylor just a ""loud bitchy black queen"" as one poster did is to completely ignore about half of what the character goes through in the movie.This is the gay buddy comedy we've been waiting for.  It isn't just about some kid coming out or a quirky relationship or someone dying like we've had before but a nice blend of stories about a group of friends that a lot of us can relate to.I just want to know how with all of the gay actors in Hollywood most of the guys in the film are staright, what is up with that?",5,The one we've been waiting for,1058745600,"07 21, 2003",2003,1368,"['Obviously', 'movie', 'not', 'depict', 'experience', 'gay', 'man', 'America', 'movie', 'ever', 'could', 'do', 'movie', 'show', 'group', 'friends', 'LA', 'dealing', 'life', 'love', 'other', 'stuff', 'having', 'fairly', 'good', 'time', 'how', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'hard', 'lonely', 'confusing', 'people', 'tend', 'be', 'able', 'pull', 'together', 'see', 'Carpenters', 'tragic', 'happy', 'song', 'analogy', 'film', 'good', 'one.I', 'think', 'people', 'who', 'find', 'film', 'demeaning', 'are', ""n't"", 'paying', 'careful', 'attention', 'movie', 'show', 'men', 'sleeping', 'around', 'being', 'shallow', 'having', 'issues', 'not', 'glorify', 'pastimes', 'matter', 'fact', 'troubles', 'encounte', 'become', 'too', 'self', 'obsessed', 'devisive', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'who', 'hurt', 'film', ""n't"", 'pander', 'stereotypes', 'genuine', 'characters', 'call', 'Taylor', 'just', 'loud', 'bitchy', 'black', 'queen', 'one', 'poster', 'did', 'completely', 'ignore', 'half', 'what', 'character', 'movie.This', 'gay', 'buddy', 'comedy', ""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', ""n't"", 'just', 'kid', 'coming', 'out', 'quirky', 'relationship', 'someone', 'dying', ""'ve"", 'had', 'nice', 'blend', 'stories', 'group', 'friends', 'lot', 'can', 'relate', 'to.I', 'just', 'want', 'know', 'how', 'gay', 'actors', 'Hollywood', 'most', 'guys', 'film', 'are', 'staright', 'what', 'up']",N/A
568374,AB9WCN34TY8CV,B0000560PU,Charles Sutherland,"[24, 24]","In some ways, this film reminded me of the sit-com ""Friends"" when I first watched it. It does have some significant differences, but it still centers on a group of people who are variously in and out of relationships with each other and outsiders, some of whom make it into the group, and others of whom do not.One of the leading characters is Dennis, who is having a mid-life crisis of a sort, not quite sure he wants to continue the pick-up life, and not sure he can continue it given his advancing age. This is driven home by the situation of his birthday party, in which he finds an attraction to J. Crew Guy, a nickname invented by his friends to keep people from having to remember names. Cole, the ""star"" of the group of friends, has invited his own catch to the party, and the rest of the friends are seething with jealousy.There are lots of wonderful little scenes and bit pieces here. Most of the friends go to the same hairdresser or stylist, and pour their hearts out to her while having their hair cut. There is a wonderful montage of clips of the various friends getting their hair cut, all talking to each other, save one man who goes to an actual therapist, and complains near the end that the rest of his friends get their hair cut while doing this.The friends center on a particular restaurant, owned by Jack, played by John Mahoney (Frasier's father in the sit-com ""Frasier""). Jack also sponsors a softball team, on which all of the friends play. Jack is a long-term partner of a man only really known as ""purple guy"", because he always dressed in purple. Jack suffers a heart-attack, and the friends become much more enlightened about the value of friendship, relationships, and permanent attachments in an often changing and unpredictable world.I identified most with the character is Patrick, the ""less attractive"" friend. At one point he describes his frustration living in southern California as the gay community is a bunch of 10s all looking for an 11, and if the light is dim enough and the guy is drunk enough, he (Patrick) might pass for a 7. I know the feeling very well.One review I read of this film said that it is the first film since ""Boys in the Band,"" put out in 1970, to feature every character in the film as a gay person. I hadn't thought about that the first time I watched the film, but it is true. There are no straight people here as major or even minor characters, only the occasional bit player, like the team members of the Hollywood Firefighter's softball team, who are not only better than the restaurant's team, but also a physical distraction, according to one team member.Each of the characters represents a different sort of gay person - Dennis is the artistic, brooding sort; Cole is the wannabe actor, a bit too good looking for his own good; Kevin is the just-coming-out and not really ready to admit he's gay person; Benji is the always looking in the wrong place for love person, who gets involved a bit in drug use near the end. Howie is the mixed up, wants a commitment but cannot commit person. Finally, Patrick (my role model) is the not-quite-that-goodlooking, good friend but always single kind of guy. Jack and Purple Guy are the long-term, older couple who both father/mother the group, and model another way of being. Of course, that all assumes that you can find a partner who will last.You will also get introduced to the phrase OGT - Obviously Gay Trait. For example, liking the music group The Carpenters is an OGT. Liking theater and Broadway musicals is an OGT. And so forth. There's just a bit of Carpenters' music around, too.This is a very interesting film, and one that resonated with me in many ways.",5,A gay film version of Friends,1122595200,"07 29, 2005",2005,3678,"['ways', 'film', 'reminded', 'sit-com', 'Friends', 'when', 'first', 'watched', 'have', 'significant', 'differences', 'still', 'group', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'variously', 'relationships', 'other', 'outsiders', 'whom', 'make', 'group', 'others', 'whom', 'do', 'leading', 'characters', 'Dennis', 'who', 'having', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'sort', 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'continue', 'pick-up', 'life', 'not', 'sure', 'can', 'continue', 'given', 'advancing', 'age', 'driven', 'home', 'situation', 'birthday', 'party', 'attraction', 'J', 'Crew', 'Guy', 'nickname', 'invented', 'friends', 'keep', 'people', 'having', 'remember', 'names', 'Cole', 'star', 'group', 'friends', 'invited', 'own', 'catch', 'party', 'rest', 'friends', 'are', 'seething', 'jealousy.There', 'are', 'lots', 'wonderful', 'little', 'scenes', 'bit', 'pieces', 'here', 'Most', 'friends', 'go', 'same', 'hairdresser', 'stylist', 'pour', 'hearts', 'having', 'hair', 'cut', 'wonderful', 'montage', 'clips', 'various', 'friends', 'getting', 'hair', 'cut', 'talking', 'other', 'save', 'one', 'man', 'who', 'actual', 'therapist', 'complains', 'end', 'rest', 'friends', 'get', 'hair', 'cut', 'doing', 'this.The', 'friends', 'center', 'particular', 'restaurant', 'owned', 'Jack', 'played', 'John', 'Mahoney', 'Frasier', 'father', 'sit-com', 'Frasier', 'Jack', 'also', 'softball', 'team', 'friends', 'play', 'Jack', 'long-term', 'partner', 'man', 'only', 'really', 'known', 'purple', 'guy', 'always', 'dressed', 'purple', 'Jack', 'heart-attack', 'friends', 'become', 'much', 'more', 'enlightened', 'value', 'friendship', 'relationships', 'permanent', 'attachments', 'often', 'changing', 'unpredictable', 'world.I', 'identified', 'most', 'character', 'Patrick', 'less', 'attractive', 'friend', 'one', 'point', 'frustration', 'living', 'southern', 'California', 'gay', 'community', 'bunch', '10s', 'looking', '11', 'light', 'dim', 'enough', 'guy', 'drunk', 'enough', 'Patrick', 'might', 'pass', '7', 'know', 'feeling', 'very', 'well.One', 'review', 'read', 'film', 'said', 'first', 'film', 'Boys', 'Band', 'put', 'out', '1970', 'feature', 'character', 'film', 'gay', 'person', 'had', ""n't"", 'thought', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'film', 'true', 'are', 'straight', 'people', 'here', 'major', 'even', 'minor', 'characters', 'only', 'occasional', 'bit', 'player', 'team', 'members', 'Hollywood', 'Firefighter', 'softball', 'team', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'better', 'restaurant', 'team', 'also', 'physical', 'distraction', 'according', 'one', 'team', 'member.Each', 'characters', 'different', 'sort', 'gay', 'person', 'Dennis', 'artistic', 'brooding', 'sort', 'Cole', 'wannabe', 'actor', 'bit', 'too', 'good', 'looking', 'own', 'good', 'Kevin', 'just-coming-out', 'not', 'really', 'ready', 'admit', 'gay', 'person', 'Benji', 'always', 'looking', 'wrong', 'place', 'love', 'person', 'who', 'involved', 'bit', 'drug', 'use', 'end', 'Howie', 'mixed', 'up', 'commitment', 'can', 'not', 'commit', 'person', 'Finally', 'Patrick', 'role', 'model', 'not-quite-that-goodlooking', 'good', 'friend', 'always', 'single', 'kind', 'guy', 'Jack', 'Purple', 'Guy', 'are', 'long-term', 'older', 'couple', 'who', 'father/mother', 'group', 'model', 'way', 'being', 'course', 'can', 'find', 'partner', 'who', 'will', 'last.You', 'will', 'also', 'get', 'introduced', 'phrase', 'OGT', 'Obviously', 'Gay', 'Trait', 'example', 'liking', 'music', 'group', 'Carpenters', 'OGT', 'Liking', 'theater', 'Broadway', 'musicals', 'OGT', 'so', 'forth', 'just', 'bit', 'Carpenters', 'music', 'very', 'interesting', 'film', 'one', 'resonated', 'many', 'ways']",N/A

Perhaps it's because its cast shows great talent in dealing with the subject matter. Or maybe it's just because all of its characters (including most of the females) are gay. Yep, you heard me right.

At first, we meet them and associate them by name and face: there's Cole (Dean Cain), blessed with good looks and a new boy each week; Benji (Zach Braff), a ""gym bunny"" with a thing for chiseled physiques; Howie (Matt McGrath), a relationship psychologist whose own dwindling relationship never seems to have ended; Taylor (Billy Porter), who begins his sentences with ""As a person in a long-term relationship""; Patrick (Ben Weber), whose average looks cause him self-pity; Jack (John Mahoney), owner of the local gay dive; and Dennis (Timothy Olyphant), who wonders if there's more to life than just being gay.From its opening moments, one might get the impression that they're in the midst of another run-of-the-mill, gay-themed movie, but it does evolve into more than simple discussions of one-nighters and drama queen displays. It calls many of the characters' lives into question, leaving Howie and Taylor without a boyfriend, throwing Cole's self-assurance into the wind, and offering Dennis a chance at what he thinks is the answer to his problems in Kevin (Andrew Keegan), whose naivety concerning matters of homosexuality makes him appealing to Dennis, who wants more in a relationship.These characters studies are brought out under some well-defined performances from actors who show no fear in playing gay roles. Olyphant lends a gentle voice and charisma to Dennis, whose narration guides the film, while newcomers Braff (the ""gym bunny""), Weber (""Average Joe""), and Porter (drama queen) each leave a lasting impression. It may even surprise some to see faces like Cain and Mahoney, and Andrew Keegan, who shows terrific range in playing the inexperienced ""newbie.""Accompanying the cast are some of the funniest moments I've seen in ages. Some may quibble about the various standard gay jokes, but they work extremely well within the material. I laughed 'til I cried at Porter's constant displays of dramatic excess, and Olyphant's subtle way with words is humorous in a very big way. And I defy anyone not to laugh at the scene in which the Broken Hearts play baseball against a team of fire-fighters, during which they attempt to guess the orientation of opposing players.The good thing about a movie like ""The Broken Hearts Club"" is that it doesn't whitewash over the emotions of its characters, but allows them to grow through their experiences. In Dennis, as well as many of the characters, we see a change of heart, some more well-defined than others, some left completely to the audience's own thought. In the end, we're left with the satisfaction of knowing the people we've met, coming to like them, laugh with them, and enjoy their company, which is more than most movies can achieve.",4,Doesn't whitewash over the emotions of its characters.,1015977600,"03 13, 2002",2002,3582,"['one', 'big', 'gay', 'soap', 'opera', 'Patrick', 'hairdresser', 'Broken', 'Hearts', 'Club', 'one', 'freshest', 'funniest', 'uplifting', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'come', 'along', 'years', 'Not', 'only', 'there', 'story', ""n't"", 'always', 'take', 'usual', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'twists', 'turns', 'are', 'characters', 'who', 'come', 'care', 'combined', 'effectively', 'touching', 'moments', 'ongoing', 'humor.Perhaps', 'better', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'shaped', 'traits', 'such', 'well-crafted', 'film', 'Perhaps', 'cast', 'great', 'talent', 'dealing', 'subject', 'matter', 'just', 'characters', 'including', 'most', 'females', 'are', 'gay', 'Yep', 'heard', 'right', '95-minute', 'duration', 'only', 'thing', 'straight', 'California', 'lovelies', 'hair.The', 'first', 'film', 'introduction', 'characters', 'first', 'meet', 'associate', 'name', 'face', 'Cole', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'blessed', 'good', 'looks', 'new', 'boy', 'week', 'Benji', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'gym', 'bunny', 'thing', 'chiseled', 'physiques', 'Howie', 'Matt', 'McGrath', 'relationship', 'psychologist', 'own', 'dwindling', 'relationship', 'never', 'have', 'ended', 'Taylor', 'Billy', 'Porter', 'who', 'sentences', 'person', 'long-term', 'relationship', 'Patrick', 'Ben', 'Weber', 'average', 'looks', 'cause', 'self-pity', 'Jack', 'John', 'Mahoney', 'owner', 'local', 'gay', 'dive', 'Dennis', 'Timothy', 'Olyphant', 'who', 'more', 'life', 'just', 'being', 'gay.From', 'opening', 'moments', 'one', 'might', 'get', 'impression', ""'re"", 'midst', 'run-of-the-mill', 'gay-themed', 'movie', 'evolve', 'more', 'simple', 'discussions', 'one-nighters', 'drama', 'queen', 'displays', 'many', 'characters', 'lives', 'question', 'leaving', 'Howie', 'Taylor', 'boyfriend', 'throwing', 'Cole', 'self-assurance', 'wind', 'offering', 'Dennis', 'chance', 'what', 'answer', 'problems', 'Kevin', 'Andrew', 'Keegan', 'naivety', 'concerning', 'matters', 'homosexuality', 'appealing', 'Dennis', 'who', 'more', 'relationship.These', 'characters', 'studies', 'are', 'brought', 'out', 'well-defined', 'performances', 'actors', 'who', 'show', 'fear', 'playing', 'gay', 'roles', 'Olyphant', 'gentle', 'voice', 'charisma', 'Dennis', 'narration', 'film', 'newcomers', 'Braff', 'gym', 'bunny', 'Weber', 'Average', 'Joe', 'Porter', 'drama', 'queen', 'leave', 'lasting', 'impression', 'may', 'even', 'surprise', 'see', 'Cain', 'Mahoney', 'Andrew', 'Keegan', 'who', 'terrific', 'range', 'playing', 'inexperienced', 'newbie', 'Accompanying', 'cast', 'are', 'funniest', 'moments', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'ages', 'may', 'quibble', 'various', 'standard', 'gay', 'jokes', 'work', 'extremely', 'well', 'material', 'laughed', 'cried', 'Porter', 'constant', 'displays', 'dramatic', 'excess', 'Olyphant', 'subtle', 'way', 'words', 'humorous', 'very', 'big', 'way', 'defy', 'anyone', 'not', 'laugh', 'scene', 'Broken', 'Hearts', 'play', 'baseball', 'team', 'fire-fighters', 'attempt', 'guess', 'orientation', 'opposing', 'players.The', 'good', 'thing', 'movie', 'Broken', 'Hearts', 'Club', ""n't"", 'whitewash', 'emotions', 'characters', 'grow', 'experiences', 'Dennis', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'characters', 'see', 'change', 'heart', 'more', 'well-defined', 'others', 'left', 'completely', 'audience', 'own', 'thought', 'end', ""'re"", 'left', 'satisfaction', 'knowing', 'people', ""'ve"", 'met', 'coming', 'like', 'enjoy', 'company', 'more', 'most', 'movies', 'can', 'achieve']",N/A

568383,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0000560PU,Ed Uyeshima,"[10, 11]","First-time director/screenwriter Greg Berlanti has done a facile, intermittently entertaining job in looking at a group of twenty-something gay friends in West Hollywood. I am grateful that that he saw no need to make grand statements about AIDS, gay marriage or any number of pertinent social issues to the gay community. Instead, the 2000 movie feels a bit like a role-reversal riff on ""Sex in the City"" with the men bonding and bickering as only close friends can. The focus is primarily on Dennis, an aspiring photographer who views his 28th birthday with trepidation as he feels entrapped by his clique to the expense of both long-lasting love and a career on hold. He waits tables at a restaurant owned by Jack, the unofficial den mother to the whole gang who hang out there. Dennis finds himself attracted to 23-year old Kevin, an inexperienced newbie who finds himself also entangled with Dennis' housemate, Cole, a narcissistic actor and bed-hopper extraordinaire thanks to his good looks and supreme confidence. Other subplots are interwoven so that the net effect is a lifestyle tableau that alternates soap opera turns with observations that alternate between astute and glib.Many of the performances help the proceedings starting with a surprisingly fey Timothy Olyphant as Dennis and a swaggering Dean Cain as Cole. Both show greater depth than I anticipated from their roles, as does Andrew Keegan as Kevin. A punked-out Zach Braff effectively plays Benji, a party boy with a penchant for muscles and drugs, and avoids the pitfall of condescending to stereotype. A bespectacled Matt McGrath portrays nerdy Howie, who is ambivalent about his feelings for Marshall played by Justin Theroux. The most predictable subplot seems to take its cue from a ""Friends"" episode with the cynical Patrick being courted for his sperm by his sister Anne and her angry partner Leslie. Ben Weber is irritating as the self-pitying Patrick, and Mary McCormack and Nia Long are given precious little to do as Anne and Leslie. In a turn that reminded me of his colorful starring role in John Guare's ""The House of Blue Leaves"" on Broadway, John Mahoney makes the most of a clich&eacute;-ridden role as Jack. The sadly underused Jennifer Coolidge shows up as the gang's indifferent hairdresser.

568388,A15Q9YEG1XPEJN,B0000560PU,Get What We Give,"[2, 3]","Why watch this film?  I've heard it referred to as a gay Steel Magnolias.  I don't think it is.  It's not that tight.  However, it is a really great film about gay men's relationships with each other.  To the errant viewer it may appear to be very superficial, but that's one of the points of the film.  Men, gay or otherwise, do not share their deep dark secrets with each other the way women do - as evidenced in Steel Magnolias.There is a point when one of the characters complains that he was not informed that his roommate/friend had not told him that he had been dating another character.  The response from the other friends is that &quot;it was a secret&quot;.  That is very real.  It was definitely within keeping with the character's traits.  Men don't always divulge their real feelings or their personal actions with even the best of their friends.  Some do (and the film points that out too), but some don't.Yes, this is a chatty film - it's not as good as it could be, but it makes its marks.  &quot;Boys in the Band&quot; gave us a similar view of gay life for a group of &quot;thirty-something&quot; men in the late 1960's.  This film isn't as good (it aspires to having been a play - but wasn't), but it does attempt to be a view of gay life for a group of &quot;twenty somethings&quot; in the late 1990's or the year 2000.One of the biggest misses, is the relationship between Olyphant and Keegan's characters.  Here is an out gay man who is in love with a not quite just out gay young man.  Both of them really think they love each other, but the relationship is never fully fleshed out, which is a shame.  Further, if Olyphant's character is just 28 and he just came out 3 years before (or so we are told), then how in the world did he become so jaded so quickly?  I felt that this character point was more befitting of a man in his mid to late 30's not one in his late 20's (unless he'd come out in his teens).There are some truly beautiful moments that force the viewer to imagine the outcome only because the director doesn't provide us with the desired outcome.  This is also a shame.However, on the whole, I recommend this movie.  It is rare that a film of this nature is made.

Never has there been a film which better depicts what it's like to be an urban gay man with a group of friends running just short of the super fast lane.  The film doesn't flinch when addressing all of the good/bad aspects of being a gay man in the big city (the sex, the drugs, the coffee consumption, the gyms, the interior decorating) but especially what it's like to be a member of a pack of friends, who laugh alike, talk alike, at times they even look alike (uh, wait, that's the Patty Duke Show, I think).  And any film which openly discusses the brilliance of Karen Carpenter, and a gay man's relationship thereto, is bound to be a favorite (of mine, at least).  In particular, there's a beautiful, heartfelt montage sequence, set to the song &quot;Close to You&quot;, that will move you to tears within seconds.

He plays the emotional heart in the center of the film, a fountain of knowledge, a bastion of acceptance.

I was particularly touched by one little speech where the character rambles on honestly about his feelings....Sure, there is some usual stereotypical fodder: drug use, angery lesbians, clubbing, and a slight but fun nod at drag queens.

He should have said ""There isn't a straight man in America who calls anyone but their girlfriend ""girlfriend""."" A minor point perhaps, but double negatives give me a right royal headache.It still gets five stars, because the other flaws are even more trifling.

The movie follows this group as they try to find themselves...and hopefully discover happiness in the process. There's Dennis, a photographer longing for a life-companion; Kevin, newly out and still struggling to discover who he is; Cole, a egotistical actor who goes through men like Kleenex; Taylor, who is dumped by his long-time partner; Patrick, who feels he is unattractive to other men; and Benji, a club kid mixing with the wrong crowd. Watching over the group is their father-figure and coach, Jack.The movie is an ensemble piece, and the all-star cast works well together. The pretty much all-straight group of guys even manage to convincingly play gay, although would it have killed them to cast a few honest-to-goodness gay men?The real star of the movie is the one-liners, however. The script is full of stingingly witty dialogue. You should watch this movie for that, if nothing else. Now, if only they could have come up with a plotline as good as the quips. The story comes across as a little soap-opera like for my taste, and everyone just seems to bitch and complain their way through the whole hour and a half. And for a movie that actually has a line about how gay movies only portray stereotypes, every gay stereotype is presented.The subtitle claims that it is ""A Romantic Comedy"", but this is perhaps one of the most unromantic movies I have ever seen, and while it has some hilarious one-liners, it really isn't a comedy either.

It is neither romantic nor comedic.  It is a movie about a bunch of bitter gay men who find thier only happiness in thier friendships with each other, and I would like to add that if my friendships were as dull and depressing as these friendships I would just die. Word of advice, if you are gay and coming out of the closet, don't watch this movie(good advice for anyone actually), you will want to stay in the closet because this movie portrays a depressing lifestyle after coming out.  The lesbian says it just right when she tells her brother that he is alot more miserable now then when he was in the closet.  This movie seems to pick out everything I would hate about the gay and lesbian lifestyles.  I don't find myself caring about any of the characters, except for maybe the character of the lesbian who has the gay brother and mabye the &quot;newbie&quot;.  The only reason I give this two stars is that this movie does support the idea that being gay is not about having sex with every guy in sight as much as the straight world seems to portray the gay world as, well, with the exception of the guy who goes to Phoenix for a month getting a movie role.  Look at this, I just watched this movie and I can't even remember the character names it was that pathetic.  To top it off, the movie is so boring, there is nothing in the movie that keeps you interested in watching it, the only reason I watched it all is because I kept hoping it would pick up and get better as it went along. I do have to say that this movie is original, and original is usually good, but in this case, being original is a bad thing becuase I haven't seen anything so originally pathetic!

568407,AFOK05KDCHSHL,B0000560PU,Libretio,"[3, 3]","Though described on the DVD packaging as ""the first mainstream gay movie"" (erm, ""Philadelphia"", anyone?), Greg Berlanti's ""The Broken Hearts Club A Romantic Comedy"" (2000) seems more than a little timid in the wake of confrontational dramas like ""Queer as Folk"", but the former producer and co-writer of TV's gay-friendly ""Dawson's Creek"" makes an auspicious directorial debut with this familiar account of several gay friends looking for love and companionship in vanity-driven Los Angeles. As one character puts it: ""Gay men in LA are a bunch of 10's looking for an 11.""Essentially the tale of a gay softball team composed of staff and management of a popular restaurant run by elderly patriarch John Mahoney (celebrated co-star of TV's ""Frasier""), the film's paper-thin narrative is roused by a combination of lively dialogue and well-defined characters, played to perfection by a terrific cast, culled mostly from the New York stage: Ben Weber is the 'Plain Joe' whose inability to attract a boyfriend is due more to his lack of self-esteem than absence of personality; Dean Cain (Superman himself!) is a hunky aspiring actor who leaves a trail of broken hearts in his wake; punk-style Zach Braff portrays a gym-queen who seems wilfully blind to the dark side of gym culture; Matt McGrath and Justin Theroux are ex-boyfriends who can't seem to let go of one another; and Andrew Keegan is the cute new kid who stumbles into this disparate group whilst struggling to come to terms with his burgeoning sexuality. The unofficial pack-leader (Timothy Olyphant) is smart, ironic, and increasingly aware of the personal opportunities he's sacrificed in his relentless pursuit of casual sex with strangers.Given the breakneck pace and distinctive character traits outlined in Berlanti's script, the actors invigorate a fairly routine scenario with their keen attention to detail and beautifully-judged responses to the various plot developments, though Olyphant (whose demonic good looks have previously seen him typecast in too many villainous roles) dominates proceedings as a young man who finds himself at a crossroads and recognizes the need to change his life forever. Mahoney is funny, wise and dignified as the Shakespeare-quoting softball coach, and Broadway singer-actor Billy Porter gets some of the best lines in a role that otherwise amounts to little more than comic relief. Beefcake is provided by supermodel-turned-actor Michael Bergin (""Baywatch Hawaii"") and Christian Kane (semi-regular on TV's ""Angel"") in cameo roles, and the lovely Kerr Smith appears briefly in one of the movie's best scenes. Watch out, too, for a memorable appearance by Jennifer Coolidge as a 'helpful' hair stylist who brings the house down with a single line of dialogue! However, a subplot involving Weber's sister (Mary McCormack) and her attempts to become a mother with long-term partner Nia Long is underdeveloped to the point of redundancy (memo to gay moviemakers: if you're gonna include lesbians in these otherwise all-male offerings, do 'em properly or not at all!), and Cain's much-publicized 'kiss' with Keegan is coyly hidden by the angle at which it's filmed, a hideous cop-out (the eminently straight Olyphant has no such qualms, however, and he kisses some of his male co-stars with abandon!). Shot on location over a three week period and photographed in Super 35 by cinematographer Paul Elliott (""And the Band Played On""), the movie has the look and feel of a widescreen TV show, and Berlanti opts for fairly basic compositions which allow the characters to govern the frame throughout.Columbia Tristar's region 1 DVD runs 95m 10s and includes both a 4:3 pan-scan version and a letterboxed (2.35:1) print, anamorphically enhanced. Picture quality is fine but not pristine, possibly due to lesser quality film stock, while the 5.1 and 2.0 soundtrack options are expansive but unremarkable. Subtitles and closed captions are provided. Extras include a trailer for the video release (what happened to the theatrical version?!), deleted scenes - including a wonderful, life-changing encounter between old pro Mahoney and youthful pretender Keegan - and a terrific commentary by Berlanti and co-producer Mickey Liddell, both of whom seem mildly surprised at how well the finished movie turned out! Clearly enjoying themselves, they recount a wealth of production details and on-set anecdotes, and they also provide comprehensive reasons for their various casting decisions, tacitly acknowledging that their actors are the heart and soul of the picture. Berlanti mentions that he hopes to preserve a number of the actors' audition tapes on DVD, but sadly, they haven't been included here.Gay cinema doesn't really need another romantic comedy, but while ""Broken Hearts"" doesn't offer anything new, it's salvaged by snappy editing, a quickfire pace, and first-class performances by some of the best young actors working in America today. And thanks to a clever, throwaway bit of name-dropping, the movie offers fleeting confirmation - at last! - of the role played by sex-god Antonio Sabato Jr. in the fantasies of hormonally-charged gay teenagers everywhere!

It's filled with witty insights (although occasionally I knew what would come out of the character's mouths before they said it) about gay culture & being gay. Unfortunately, writer/director Greg Berlanti chose to populate his film with a roster of gay stereotypes: the lovelorn everyman, the drama queen, the average joe, the shallow pretty boy, etc. But who cares?? As long as those stereotypes are done well. And they are. This film is driven by some wonderful performances. Tim Olyphant is engaging as Dennis, a photographer who's open to love but wary of repeating the mistakes of the past. Dean Cain has the trickiest role: playing a shallow actor who uses scripted lines to break up with the latest boyfriend but manages to be forgiven, simply because he's adorable & unapologetic about himself. THEN his character finds out what it's like to be dumped (by another hunky closeted actor, no less), which adds poignancy & depth to Cain's character. Taylor is the resident drama queen who crows about his LTR--until he gets dumped & goes through some hilarious traumas (during a ""revenge"" phase, he keeps rewinding the most gruesome scene from a Joan Crawford movie in which she decapitates an unfaithful lover & his mistress). ""Scrub's"" Zach Braff plays Benji, the bleach blond twink with a thing for ""gym bunnies"" and falling into the wrong crowd. Adorable Andrew Keegan is Kevin, the ""newbie"" who must takes his lumps on the way to coming out. And ""Frasier's"" John Mahoney plays Jack, the ""father figure"" who dispenses advice to his brood & tries to steer them in the right direction. To make an already long story short, there's many great actors I haven't mentioned here.""Broken Hearts"" is subtitled ""a romantic comedy"", and aptly so. What do straights seek? What do gays seek? LOVE. It's universal, it transcends all boundaries & labels.What keeps this movie from being 5-star statis are the cliches. How many times must we see those mundane musical montages showing the characters dealing with their pain once a character dies? And the scene where Dennis rejects the guy he's attracted to because ""it all seems superficial"". PLEASE!! As shallow as it is, can you honestly tell me that you'll throw an attractive person out of your bedroom just because he doesn't like the Carpenters?? I thought this was a dumb plot device, an ""easy way out"". No wonder poor Dennis can't find love!This isn't my favorite gay film, but I defy you not to like it.

The ruminations on the lack of real substance in the on-again off-again relationships of a tight group of L.A. gay men will strike a resonant chord, and their words often have the sting of truth, especially in the many edgy scenes between lovers who barely know each other.

Cole (Dean Cain) - the beautiful, dumb one of the group who everyone secretly envies.  Howie (Matt McGrath) - the smart, intellectual person whose dry sarcastic humor is always well timed.

It's not just the songs, it's the idea that The Carpenters (*qua* cultural phenomenon), admittedly second- or even third-string, represent a haven for our own comfortable mediocrity.  I don't know, but movies about mediocrity, whether in art or in love, leave me with the feeling that I've just eaten a cinematic Pop Tart.  This movie, that not-so-secretly wants to be a queer Sex In the City, is the hopefully heartwarming story of a gaggle of gay (male) friends, all searching for Mr. Right.

568424,A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F,B0000560PU,"Terrance Richard ""Terry Richard""","[1, 2]","Way before ""Queer as Folk"" debut, this little independent filmed found its way into movie theatres and into the hearts of millions. ""The Broken Hearts Club"" is about a bunch of gay men, living in the Westwood area of Los Angeles, which is the city's gay district. The characters range in age from their early '20's to their late '50's, and anyone who watches this film can relate to at least one of the characters. We see stories of guys trying to find that special relationship with Mr. Right, guys having problems while having a relationship, and we even see a story of a gay man who may give his sperm to a lesbian couple; I have to wonder if that story actually persuaded the writers of ""Queer as Folk"" to do a similar story with Brian. Anyhow, ""The Broken Hearts Club"" is really one of the best gay themed films ever, with superb acting, directing, and writing. Dean Cain, who plays the promiscuos stud in the piece, steals the film. His good looks and demeanor are really intense, and we can see why men would fall for him. In this movie two types of gays are portrayed; the ones who want a relationship, and those who are contented in living their lives alone, albeit with a good sex life. What ties the men together is their genuine friendship for one another, as we see their love for each other is what binds them. I look at ""The Broken Hearts Club"" as the gay ""Sex and the City"", where friends would do anything for one another.This is a great piece of cinema and I would recommend it highly to anyone who wants to watch a film with integrity and intelligence. I only wish more films of this calliber were being produced in Hollywood.The DVD features commentary by the ditrector and producer, there are deleted scenes added, and the original trailer is included.Critic Jami Bernard, from the New York Daily Times, says...""new ground is broken by ""The Broken Hearts Club"".

The commentary on the DVD is the best commentary track I've ever come across; so informative and yet also fun on its own, reaffirming the impression one gets from watching this movie, that it was a fun movie for all the players to make.  The friendship of several gay men is the main theme, and the addition of a &quot;newbie&quot; into their midst.  The core friendship, the one which is the most intriguing, is between Dennis and Cole, the roommates who are so compatible the actors themselves have immense chemistry between them.  Dennis is introduced as a one-night-stand only fellow who decides to mend his ways in search of a meaningful romantic relationship.  Cole is the one who is superficial in the extreme, except when it comes to his friends.  When it comes to them, he's not superficial at all, which is why - in spite of their envy of him - he is treated with great affection and deference.  He is truly the totem they revolve around.  Cole is played by Dean Cain, who gives a remarkably layered performance in the role, remarkable considering he is playing what is supposed to be perceived as a totally superficial character.  You would think one could not have it both ways, but he does.  All of the actors - all good - are cast according to physical type, but they all have stories to be told, and how enthralling the story is has to be up to the viewer's tastes.  With an ensemble piece, that's what happens.  (You and your best friend may differ on your favorite character and what plotline matters most.)  However, the important thing is this film can lead to interesting discussions, and there aren't many movies fun to dissect after the fact.  Two classic scenes: the baseball game flirtation between Dean Cain and Kerr Smith, and the intercuts with the guys getting their haircuts.  Classic line: &quot;Oh, please, that's right up there with 'He's not gay, he's in a fraternity.'&quot;",4,The 30 year crunch,986774400,"04 9, 2001",2001,2080,"['main', 'core', 'friendship', 'thirtysomethings', 'going', 'life-changing/affirming', 'crises', 'coming', 'out', 'top', 'least', 'better', 'off', 'were', 'before', 'commentary', 'DVD', 'best', 'commentary', 'track', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'come', 'so', 'informative', 'yet', 'also', 'fun', 'own', 'reaffirming', 'impression', 'one', 'watching', 'movie', 'was', 'fun', 'movie', 'players', 'make', 'friendship', 'several', 'gay', 'men', 'main', 'theme', 'addition', 'quot', 'quot', 'midst', 'core', 'friendship', 'one', 'most', 'intriguing', 'Dennis', 'Cole', 'roommates', 'who', 'are', 'so', 'compatible', 'actors', 'have', 'immense', 'chemistry', 'Dennis', 'introduced', 'one-night-stand', 'only', 'fellow', 'who', 'mend', 'ways', 'search', 'meaningful', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'Cole', 'one', 'who', 'superficial', 'extreme', 'when', 'friends', 'When', 'not', 'superficial', 'why', 'spite', 'envy', 'treated', 'great', 'affection', 'deference', 'truly', 'totem', 'revolve', 'around', 'Cole', 'played', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'who', 'remarkably', 'layered', 'performance', 'role', 'remarkable', 'considering', 'playing', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'perceived', 'totally', 'superficial', 'character', 'would', 'think', 'one', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'ways', 'actors', 'good', 'are', 'cast', 'according', 'physical', 'type', 'have', 'stories', 'be', 'told', 'how', 'enthralling', 'story', 'be', 'up', 'viewer', 'tastes', 'ensemble', 'piece', 'what', 'best', 'friend', 'may', 'differ', 'favorite', 'character', 'what', 'plotline', 'matters', 'most', 'However', 'important', 'thing', 'film', 'can', 'lead', 'interesting', 'discussions', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'movies', 'fun', 'dissect', 'fact', 'Two', 'classic', 'scenes', 'baseball', 'game', 'flirtation', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'Kerr', 'Smith', 'intercuts', 'guys', 'getting', 'haircuts', 'Classic', 'line', 'quot', 'Oh', 'please', 'right', 'there', ""'He"", 'not', 'gay', 'fraternity', 'quot']",N/A

Jones-Yelvington ""newlesson""","[5, 6]","The reviews are correct -- this is quite clearly not a &quot;romantic comedy,&quot; but might be more accurately labeled as a comedic drama. The movie might be described as a super-glossy, Hollywoodized version of Love! Valour! Compassion! The bonds of friendship are the central theme of the film, and the explorations of said friendships are effective, if surface-level.Berlanti's Dawson's Creek connections show themselved, both through the characters' verbose self awareness and through emotionally manipulative melancholic music montages, two of which are backed by Dawson's Creek soundtrack regular Mary Beth Maziarz. (A master of deliciously depressing cover songs.)The film draws upon the romantic comedy conventions of witty one liners and sappy, perfectly scripted dialogue to force us into caring about its characters, all of which have just enough depth to trick us into thinking they might actually be three dimensional.The characters' intertwining stories of love, loss and lust -- if  derivative -- are engrossing, and ultimately moving. I'll disagree with other reviewers in my assertion that Timothy Olyphant's character (I've forgotten his name -- I'll take a page from the Broken Hearts Club book and call him &quot;Lead Guy&quot;) nicely pulls the friends' stories together w/ a character arc of sorts. His romance with Keegan's Kevin is sweetly, nicely, built, and his ultimate departure for Europe (in conjunction w/ John Mahoney's death and Blonde Guy's overdose) provides a well-timed -- if slightly forced -- culmination of the film's stories.The Broken Hearts Club is a sweet, engaging, film.
