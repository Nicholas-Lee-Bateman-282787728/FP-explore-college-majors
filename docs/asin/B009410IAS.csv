And this is coming from an East Indian who grew up in Africa and spent his tennage years in England. That's where I heard the Doobies for the first time. I consider &#34;Toulouse Street&#34;, &#34;The Captain and Me&#34;, and &#34;What Were Once Vices Are Now Habits&#34; to be 3 of the greatest albums ever released by any American band. Everyone should own them and this DVD as well.

Over the past few years a couple of DVD'S chronicling The Who and Tom Petty were released.  These two releases were absolute knockouts!  They were expansive wonderfully detailed and highly entertaining stories behined two amazing bands.  The story of The Doobie Brothers clocks in at about an hour and a half and feels like a somewhat rushed overview of a band that I feel deserved a better treatment.  Things move along in swift chronological order dating back to when the band began playing in biker bars, none of this is elaborated on, it just lets the viewer know and moves on to the next topic.  When it comes to the making of the albums in the early seventies the viewer gets to see a clip hear and there of the band performing the hits but does not go into any detail about the conceptual ideas or studio footage or audience reaction to those classic albums.  Sure we get to here the boys talk about how excited they were when they first heard their songs on the radio, (how many times have we heard those kind of stories).  When the the story would go on to its next subject I would be thinking, that's it!  That's all their going to say about it!  The DVD also covers the late seventies Michael Mcdonald years, and once again its interesting but nothing most people don't already know.  This story just wasn't juicy enough for me.  Its a very good brief overview of a band if you are not to firmiliar with them but for those expecting full out documentary on the Doobie Brothers and their impact on popular music in the seventies will more than likely be a bit let down.  Eagle Rock is the best at these kind of releases,  I just hope the next item I purchase from them will leave me floored like so many of their other DVD'S have.",3,A pretty bare bones overview of one of the seventies biggest bands.,1353801600,"11 25, 2012",2012,1854,"['wanted', 'looove', 'rockumentary', 'Doobie', 'was', 'left', 'breadcrumbs', 'instead', 'whole', 'loaf', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'couple', 'DVD', 'chronicling', 'Who', 'Tom', 'Petty', 'were', 'released', 'two', 'releases', 'were', 'absolute', 'knockouts', 'were', 'expansive', 'wonderfully', 'detailed', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'stories', 'behined', 'two', 'amazing', 'bands', 'story', 'Doobie', 'Brothers', 'clocks', 'hour', 'half', 'feels', 'somewhat', 'rushed', 'overview', 'band', 'feel', 'deserved', 'better', 'treatment', 'Things', 'move', 'along', 'swift', 'chronological', 'order', 'dating', 'back', 'when', 'band', 'began', 'playing', 'biker', 'bars', 'none', 'elaborated', 'just', 'viewer', 'know', 'moves', 'next', 'topic', 'When', 'making', 'albums', 'early', 'seventies', 'viewer', 'see', 'clip', 'hear', 'band', 'performing', 'hits', 'not', 'go', 'detail', 'conceptual', 'ideas', 'studio', 'footage', 'audience', 'reaction', 'classic', 'albums', 'Sure', 'get', 'here', 'boys', 'talk', 'how', 'excited', 'were', 'when', 'first', 'heard', 'songs', 'radio', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'heard', 'kind', 'stories', 'When', 'story', 'would', 'go', 'next', 'subject', 'would', 'be', 'thinking', 'going', 'say', 'DVD', 'also', 'late', 'seventies', 'Michael', 'Mcdonald', 'years', 'once', 'again', 'interesting', 'nothing', 'most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'story', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'juicy', 'enough', 'very', 'good', 'brief', 'overview', 'band', 'are', 'not', 'firmiliar', 'expecting', 'full', 'out', 'documentary', 'Doobie', 'Brothers', 'impact', 'popular', 'music', 'seventies', 'will', 'more', 'likely', 'be', 'bit', 'let', 'down', 'Eagle', 'Rock', 'best', 'kind', 'releases', 'just', 'hope', 'next', 'item', 'purchase', 'will', 'leave', 'floored', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'DVD', 'have']",N/A

1585022,A2RWGW6TGUX7E5,B009410IAS,"Gary Covington ""Southern Rocker""","[1, 1]","This is a very well presented Rock Documentary of the Story & History of the Doobie Brothers from their very beginning, all the way up through around 2012 when the dvd was produced. Their story is told by members and former band members and managers themselves, which makes this Rock/Doc more credible, than if an ""outsider"" had told their story. It covers their many breakups and reunions, personnel changes, and many details that went on in the band throughout their 40 year history.The main players in the band seem to be Pat Simmons & Tom Johnston. They were there in the very beginning, and they are both still with the band. The band is currently touring, and they fairly recently released a new album entitled ""World Gone Crazy"", which is a very good album. It seems they have gotten better over time, but that's subjective on my part. This band has had it's share of hardships and personnel changes, and all of this is covered in this dvd.Apparently after the dvd was produced, their long time ""recent"" bassist ""Skylark"" had a stroke, and he is no longer with the band. In the liner notes and at the end of the dvd, they acknowledge tribute to former band members (brothers) who have passed on.One thing I really liked about this documentary, is that you get Bonus ""Full Performances"". These Bonus Full Performances are full of great ""Vintage"" Doobie Brothers. They start out with very early performances and then progress into fairly recent performances.Overall, this is a very good, very well presented documentary, of the story & history of the Doobie Brothes, one of the World's most be-loved bands.

One of the founding members, Tom Johnston, was going to have to miss some tour dates suffering from the rigors of the road. Everyone was nervous. It was the end of 1974, and they were one of the hottest bands in the country. Tom had a bleeding ulcer so no one knew how many shows he'd have to miss.Jeff ""Skunk"" Baxter, one of the newest members of the Doobies, had a thought. He called on fellow Steely Dan alum Michael McDonald.Little did the band know that Michael wouldn't just be the shot in the arm they needed but also a change in direction.These are just  a couple of the stories you'll hear on The Doobie Brothers - Let the Music Play, a DVD that traces the group's humble beginning in California in 1969, their rise up the charts and how they've stayed a band for over 40 years.Along the way you'll hear classic Doobie tunes like ""Rainy Day Crossroad Blues,"" ""Without You,"" ""Listen To the Music,"" ""Black Water,"" ""Takin' It To the Streets,"" ""Rockin' Down the Highway,"" ""Long Train Runnin,'"" and ""China Grove.""They started out with Tom playing chunky rthym, Patrick Simmons doing masterful finger picking, three part harmony and playing for $1 a night and all they could drink.Of course, the most famous story is here too, when a hanger-on said, ""You guys smoke so much dope you should call yourselves the Doobie Brothers.""",4,American rock band shows what it takes to last,1358899200,"01 23, 2013",2013,1536,"['Jim', 'Clark', 'publisher', 'Lee', 'County', 'Courier', 'Tupelo', 'MississippiI', 'consider', 'fortunate', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'catch', 'Doobie', 'Brothers', 'live', 'prime.Actually', 'caught', 'transition', 'phrase', 'One', 'founding', 'members', 'Tom', 'Johnston', 'was', 'going', 'have', 'miss', 'tour', 'dates', 'suffering', 'rigors', 'road', 'Everyone', 'was', 'nervous', 'was', 'end', '1974', 'were', 'one', 'hottest', 'bands', 'country', 'Tom', 'had', 'bleeding', 'ulcer', 'so', 'no', 'one', 'knew', 'how', 'many', ""'d"", 'have', 'miss.Jeff', 'Skunk', 'Baxter', 'one', 'newest', 'members', 'Doobies', 'had', 'thought', 'called', 'fellow', 'Steely', 'Dan', 'alum', 'Michael', 'McDonald.Little', 'did', 'band', 'know', 'Michael', 'would', ""n't"", 'just', 'be', 'shot', 'arm', 'needed', 'also', 'change', 'direction.These', 'are', 'just', 'couple', 'stories', ""'ll"", 'hear', 'Doobie', 'Brothers', 'Let', 'Music', 'Play', 'DVD', 'group', 'humble', 'beginning', 'California', '1969', 'rise', 'charts', 'how', ""'ve"", 'stayed', 'band', '40', 'years.Along', 'way', ""'ll"", 'hear', 'classic', 'Doobie', 'tunes', 'Rainy', 'Day', 'Crossroad', 'Blues', 'Listen', 'Music', 'Black', 'Water', 'Takin', 'Streets', 'Rockin', 'Down', 'Highway', 'Long', 'Train', 'Runnin', 'China', 'Grove', 'started', 'out', 'Tom', 'playing', 'chunky', 'rthym', 'Patrick', 'Simmons', 'doing', 'masterful', 'finger', 'picking', 'three', 'part', 'harmony', 'playing', '1', 'night', 'could', 'drink.Of', 'course', 'most', 'famous', 'story', 'here', 'too', 'when', 'hanger-on', 'said', 'guys', 'smoke', 'so', 'much', 'dope', 'should', 'call', 'Doobie', 'Brothers']",N/A

1585026,A2G7HV826ENWKD,B009410IAS,Stephen Bieth,"[31, 33]",To be fair I just got into the Doobie's in the last year. Saw my first concert of theirs last month (it rocked). So my knowledge on this band is some what limited. So this release could not come at a better time. The two hour plus Blu ray gives a great overview of a band that has gone thru a lot of changes over the years. It interveiws just about everyone who is still alive that has been thru the band or worked with them in a significant role (such as Ted Templemen the producer of some of their best records). The thing that struck me was how at peace the band is with their history. In most Band's members of one era would be trying to take credit over members from another. But here Michael MacDonald seems very comfterble saying his period of the Doobie's is not the true Doobie's sound. Don't worry he gets his credit for saving the band when the thought they couldn't go on after Tom Johnston had to leave for health reasons (bleeding ulcer). It also does not treat the reunion years as an after thought like so many of these documentaries do. It takes you thru record by record. Over all I was very happy with this documentary.This disc also has about 45 minutes of live footage. I figured this would be from a current tour but it actually spans their career. It also has some of their biggest hits. Overall I could not be happier with this package.,5,Kickin' back with the Doobie's,1353024000,"11 16, 2012",2012,1360,"['be', 'fair', 'just', 'got', 'Doobie', 'last', 'year', 'Saw', 'first', 'concert', 'theirs', 'last', 'month', 'rocked', 'knowledge', 'band', 'what', 'limited', 'release', 'could', 'not', 'come', 'better', 'time', 'two', 'hour', 'Blu', 'ray', 'great', 'overview', 'band', 'gone', 'thru', 'lot', 'changes', 'years', 'just', 'everyone', 'who', 'still', 'alive', 'been', 'band', 'worked', 'significant', 'role', 'such', 'Ted', 'Templemen', 'producer', 'best', 'records', 'thing', 'struck', 'was', 'how', 'peace', 'band', 'history', 'most', 'Band', 'members', 'one', 'era', 'would', 'be', 'trying', 'take', 'credit', 'members', 'here', 'Michael', 'MacDonald', 'very', 'comfterble', 'saying', 'period', 'Doobie', 'not', 'true', 'Doobie', 'sound', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'credit', 'saving', 'band', 'when', 'thought', 'could', ""n't"", 'go', 'Tom', 'Johnston', 'had', 'leave', 'health', 'reasons', 'bleeding', 'ulcer', 'also', 'not', 'treat', 'reunion', 'years', 'thought', 'so', 'many', 'documentaries', 'do', 'thru', 'record', 'record', 'was', 'very', 'happy', 'documentary.This', 'disc', 'also', '45', 'minutes', 'live', 'footage', 'figured', 'would', 'be', 'current', 'tour', 'actually', 'career', 'also', 'biggest', 'hits', 'Overall', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'happier', 'package']",N/A
1585027,ASEBX8TBYWQWA,B009410IAS,"Steven I. Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[14, 14]","In the essay by San Francisco Chronicle music journalist Joel Selvin which accompanies some great Doobie Brother memorabilia in the 8-page booklet inserted the BD case, Selvin refers to this 99-minute film as both a ""sprawling documentary"" and a ""scrapbook"", both terms that I think accurately describe the centerpiece of this DVD and Bluray package. When original DB member Pat Simmons discovered a trove of old videos spanning 40 years in his house, he - and the remaining DBs provided them to filmmaker Barry Ehrmann to create the film.I'll admit up front that I have always liked the DBs but I was never a rabid fan and knew little about them other than what I heard on the radio. But, after watching this thoroughly enjoyable film, I know a lot more. And the snippets of songs I heard - there are no full performances in the film (how could there be? - they produced way too many hits) but nine are included as bonus tracks - brought back a lot of memories. All the important folks are here in open, and in depth, interviews. All the living members (four have died over the years) of the band, their manager (of 40 years!) Bruce Cohn and Producer Ted Templeman. Unlike many of these ""story of"" documentaries, it's not loaded with comments from music journalists or biographers. There's only one and, honestly, I forget his name and I'm not sure he adds much except from a fan's perspective.The footage, both in the film and as part of the 43-minute ""bonus"" section, is not always the best lighted or sharpest but - if we are to believe Selvin's comment that much of this is being seen for the first time in years - it's certainly watchable. And, as the band sings in just one of their biggest hits, just ""listen to the music"". It's still great.In 1982 when the band members decided it was time to quit for a while (actually only five years) they did it as friends and you hear no real animosity from any of them.If you are DB devotee you may see this film from a different perspective and have some gripes. As for me, I found this both an insightful and entertaining film. Sure, five minutes before the end you hear the members promoting their latest album (and their new brand of wine - which benefits charities in the Bay Area), but the 94 minutes before that are (to excerpt another DB hit) ""just alright with me"".I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",5,Forty years and still making music and working together.
