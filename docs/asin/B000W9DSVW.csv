While the features for Ocean's Eleven are the same as what's out there, having it in HD is a good bonus. But, what made this a must buy were the HD exclusive features on Ocean's Twelve and Thirteen.First, O12 includes a new commentary with Soderbergh and writer George Nolfi, a selection of additional scenes and an HBO Making-Of Special. O13 also includes a commentary with Soderbergh and writers Brian Koppelman and David Levien and a Masters of the Heist featurette (though that one is available via a bonus disc at Target I believe). Also included are additional scenes and a couple other featurettes, most in HD.Honestly, the picture quality isn't anything great but it is good. Of course, this isn't something I'm going to use to show off my home theater but for general home viewing, I know I will be watching these over and over again (yes, even Ocean's Twelve, a movie that has grown on me over the years).Since it's only under $20 per movie, even if you already own O11 and O12, this is still worth the upgrade.",4,"Great Set, Great Movies, Great Price",1195862400,"11 24, 2007",2007,1078,"['new', 'HD-DVD', 'owner', 'immediately', 'jumped', 'set', 'features', 'Ocean', 'Eleven', 'are', 'same', 'what', 'out', 'there', 'having', 'HD', 'good', 'bonus', 'what', 'made', 'must', 'buy', 'were', 'HD', 'exclusive', 'features', 'Ocean', 'Twelve', 'Thirteen.First', 'O12', 'new', 'commentary', 'Soderbergh', 'writer', 'George', 'Nolfi', 'selection', 'additional', 'scenes', 'HBO', 'Making-Of', 'Special', 'O13', 'also', 'commentary', 'Soderbergh', 'writers', 'Brian', 'Koppelman', 'David', 'Levien', 'Masters', 'Heist', 'featurette', 'one', 'available', 'bonus', 'disc', 'Target', 'believe', 'Also', 'included', 'are', 'additional', 'scenes', 'couple', 'other', 'featurettes', 'most', 'HD.Honestly', 'picture', 'quality', ""n't"", 'anything', 'great', 'good', 'course', ""n't"", 'something', ""'m"", 'going', 'use', 'show', 'off', 'home', 'theater', 'general', 'home', 'viewing', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'watching', 'over', 'again', 'yes', 'even', 'Ocean', 'Twelve', 'movie', 'grown', 'years', '.Since', 'only', '20', 'movie', 'even', 'already', 'own', 'O11', 'O12', 'still', 'worth', 'upgrade']",Ocean's Trilogy (Ocean's Eleven / Ocean's Twelve / Ocean's Thirteen)
