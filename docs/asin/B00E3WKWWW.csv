There were lots of other items and actions that I could relate to. However my wife likes the watering method used by Melinda Dillon (mother) around the trophy.

This year, I decided to purchase a copy of this movie, and chose this one.As other reviewers have said, if you have a previous special anniversary non-Blu Ray DVD, this could be worth purchasing.  Since they also include a DVD of the movie along with the Blu Ray DVD, when you compare the two, it does make sense to own a blu ray copy.There's little things that get edited out on TV, it's nice to sit back and watch it seamlessly, and the part where Ralphie fights Scut always brings a tear.Enjoy.",5,"This is the way to go, if you don't own a good copy.",1388534400,"01 1, 2014",2014,565,"[""'d"", 'gotten', 'too', 'used', 'seeing', 'TV', 'marathons', 'years', 'year', 'decided', 'purchase', 'copy', 'movie', 'chose', 'one.As', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'have', 'previous', 'special', 'anniversary', 'non-Blu', 'Ray', 'DVD', 'could', 'be', 'worth', 'purchasing', 'also', 'include', 'DVD', 'movie', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'DVD', 'when', 'compare', 'two', 'make', 'sense', 'own', 'blu', 'ray', 'little', 'things', 'get', 'edited', 'out', 'TV', 'nice', 'sit', 'back', 'watch', 'seamlessly', 'part', 'where', 'Ralphie', 'fights', 'Scut', 'always', 'tear.Enjoy']",N/A

1664409,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B00E3WKWWW,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[5, 9]","I was almost finished recording ""A Christmas Story"" on one Christmas morning. Fifteen minutes before it ended, my father walked in and said that we would get the special edition.That I didn't go postal at losing an hour and a half on something that would shortly be redundant shows how much I love ""A Christmas Story."" This 1983 classic is not just a heartwarming little story about a loving (if bickery) family in the dour America of the late 1940s, but a hysterical comedy about what it's like to be a kid at Christmas.Ralphie Parker's (Peter Billingsley) Christmas wishes are simple: a official Red Ryder, carbine action, two-hundred shot range model air rifle with a compass and a ""thing that tells time."" But his mom says he'll shoot his eye out. So Ralphie begins a quiet crusade to get it as a present -- he writes an essay on it and even asks Santa, only to get the same terrible reply: ""You'll shoot your eye out.""As the days tick down to Christmas -- with no sign of an air rifle -- Ralphie hits other obstacles when he clashes with bullies, says ""the mother of all dirty words,"" and watches his parents battle it out over a tacky ""major award"" (leg lamp). But there are surprises in store for the Parker family on Christmas morning -- and some of them involve smelly bloodhounds.Yes, the plot is pretty simple -- it's the delivery that makes it special. It's narrated by an adult Ralphie who offers his slightly sardonic take on everything (""We plunged into the cornucopia quivering with desire and the ecstasy of unbridled avarice""), mingled with a hint of nostalgia. And it's completely tuned in to how kids think, and how a toy can seem like the most important thing in the world.Fortunately the scriptwriters never condescend to the audience by adding some kind of syrupy message -- after all, real life doesn't work that way. Instead there are all sorts of classic moments -- the leg lamp, Chinese turkey, the terrifying visit to Santa (""HOOOO HOOOO HOOO!""), and Ralphie's fantasies of defending his family with ""Ol' Blue"" against a bunch of inept, unarmed bandits.And Jean Shepherd -- the co-writer and narrator of the movie -- deserves especial credit for bringing this movie to life. He covers the movie with a snowstorm of one-liners and hilarious dialogue: ""Over the years I got to be quite a connoisseur of soap."" ""He looks like a pink nightmare!"" ""Oh FUUUDDDDGGGE!"" and others.Billingsley is a little stiff as Ralphie, but gives the portrayal of this everykid his charming, slightly frenetic best. Melinda Dillon and Darin McGavin are the comic geniuses here, with their slightly kooky but loving parents (one of the highlights is Dillon's ""show me how the piggies eat!"" scene, and McGavin's revolted response), and there's an array of very convincing bullies and classmates too.""A Christmas Story"" didn't get much notice when it came out in 1983. But now it's one of the quintessential holiday movies, and a must-see at Christmastime.

1664412,A2KI1SGCZT2OEI,B00E3WKWWW,"Mark E. Stenroos ""Sibelius fan""","[74, 77]","I received this yesterday and did a spot check today. The new BD looks to be the same visually as the earlier BD issue. The DTS sound was clean enough, but as the original mono soundtrack isn't exactly a barn burner, there's no great improvement.I will need to closely watch the entire film again, because to my eyes and ears, the dialogue appears to be slightly out-of-sync with the picture every once in a while. We're talking milliseconds here, but something seemed not right to me. Maybe it was the rum in the egg nog talking. Or maybe it has something to do with the DTS process.Extras: Being able to access an HD digital version is a plus, and the BD includes a new featurette entitled ""Christmas in Ohio: A Christmas Story House,"" which runs 21:19 and features an all-growed-up Ian Petrella (aka Randy) and Brian Jones, founder of the ""A Christmas Story House"" in Cleveland. Also, the original recordings by Jean Shepherd that appeared on the 20th-anniversary DVD edition but were missing on the earlier BD have returned. What's still missing are the 20th-anniversary trivia & decoder ring extras from the DVD, which were sort of lame anyway. Watching some of the extras as the participants keep referring to the 20th anniversary of the film (the edition for which the extras were originally filmed) emphasizes how little updating was done for this 30th Anniversary BD Edition.This 2-disc set includes a DVD as well - it includes both widescreen and full screen versions of the film. The BD contains only the widescreen version.
