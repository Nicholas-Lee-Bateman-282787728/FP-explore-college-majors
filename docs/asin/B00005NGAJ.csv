But the content is so good-natured, humorous and tongue-in-cheek, that you refrain from judging Flatley for his lack of class.  One of the final sequences, the ""new and improved"" Stolen Kiss is so over the top, that you can't help laughing.  It got far, far away from Irish-dancing.  It's more like flamenco stip-tease.  You can really tell that Flatley got really tired towards the end of his career.  He doesn't do much dancing.  He just stands in the middle of the stage and lets the troupe dance around him.",5,Michael out-Flatlied himself,1135814400,"12 29, 2005",2005,614,"['am', 'not', 'going', 'raise', 'issue', 'good', 'taste', 'collection', 'flashy', 'trashy', 'content', 'so', 'good-natured', 'humorous', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'refrain', 'judging', 'Flatley', 'lack', 'class', 'One', 'final', 'sequences', 'new', 'improved', 'Stolen', 'Kiss', 'so', 'top', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'laughing', 'got', 'far', 'far', 'away', 'Irish-dancing', 'more', 'like', 'flamenco', 'stip-tease', 'can', 'really', 'tell', 'Flatley', 'got', 'really', 'tired', 'end', 'career', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'dancing', 'just', 'middle', 'stage', 'troupe', 'dance']",Michael Flatley Gold

This DVD proves it with these incredible performances at different venues and different times in his career. His commentary is inciteful and the candor is refreshing. We all know he has an ego bigger than a house, but man can he ever dance. These performances are some of his best and a great collection to have. Must have DVD if you are at all interested in Michael Flatly!!",5,Incredible performances,1255046400,"10 9, 2009",2009,428,"['Michael', 'Flatly', 'doubt', 'Lord', 'Dance', 'DVD', 'incredible', 'performances', 'different', 'venues', 'different', 'times', 'career', 'commentary', 'inciteful', 'candor', 'refreshing', 'know', 'ego', 'bigger', 'house', 'man', 'can', 'ever', 'dance', 'performances', 'are', 'best', 'great', 'collection', 'have', 'Must', 'have', 'DVD', 'are', 'interested', 'Michael', 'Flatly']",Michael Flatley Gold
