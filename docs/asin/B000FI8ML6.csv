We see him as a young boy climbing an electrical tower with some friends telling him he's going to get electrocuted. Sure enough...it happens. After that, he seems to go through electro shock therapy whenever he gets into trouble. It's usually in fights and continues as he gets older. As a result, he's now charged with 80,000 volts of electricity at all times. He has his own version of the therapy that involves him bolting himself to a table. The only way he can deal with being charged with this much electricity is by playing his electric guitar. On top of that though, he's a lizard expert and has quite the collection. When one of his lizards turns up missing and Thunderbolt Buddha steps into the picture, that's when things get even more bizarre.This movie is beyond weird. It clocks in at a little under 55 minutes. Calling it a film or a movie may be a bit out of place considering the length. The best way to describe it is by saying it's like an extended music video spliced with a live action anime or manga. I was reading up on the film's origin and apparently the director used the leftover funds from a previous film to make this one. Even using two of the main actors from that same film (Gojoe: Spirit War Chronicle). While that may be the case, this stands alone as its own film. The film's biggest strength is the way it was shot. It's entirely shot in black and white and its style just seems to bleed off the screen. The most unique shots tend to be when Dragon Eye is playing his guitar as the lighting and perspective are just what you'd expect from someone taking all their frustrations out on a guitar, which tend to be in your face. There's a scene towards the last half of the film though where Thunderbolt Buddha does something to get Dragon Eye's full attention where Dragon Eye is moving through rooms without moving himself. It looks like he's just floating from room to room and it just helps the viewer realize what he's feeling at that particular moment in the film; like it's all some sort of bad dream.The music may be what makes or breaks the film for the viewer as it tends to walk a thin line between being kinda catchy to just being distorted noise with screaming. The film is loud in every sense of the word. Whenever Dragon Eye starts to play his guitar, it just sounds like a lot of noise. It fit the film as that would make sense if someone was channeling 80,000 volts of electricity through a guitar it would probably sound more like that than something a bit more polished. But if someone wasn't a fan of loud, heavy music then it may affect their judgement of the film.Electric Dragon 80,000 V is more of a bizarre black and white experiment than anything else. On the bright side, it's original. It's not based off of anything or a remake of anything. It stands on its own two legs and that's saying something these days. Its originality may be its downfall for some viewers though as the manga influences practically flow through every frame surrounding itself with loud, heavy guitar riffs. If you're a fan of previous Tadanobu Asano films or are in the mood for something unique, I'd highly recommend it. I wouldn't recommend it to just anyone though as it may be so bizarre it'd wind up going over a lot of people's heads.Rating: 7/10",4,Bizarre and Unique,1214092800,"06 22, 2008",2008,3348,"['Dragon', 'Eye', 'Morrison', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'had', 'normal', 'childhood', 'see', 'young', 'boy', 'climbing', 'electrical', 'tower', 'friends', 'telling', 'going', 'get', 'electrocuted', 'Sure', 'enough', 'go', 'electro', 'shock', 'therapy', 'whenever', 'trouble', 'usually', 'fights', 'older', 'result', 'now', 'charged', '80,000', 'volts', 'electricity', 'times', 'own', 'version', 'therapy', 'bolting', 'table', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'deal', 'being', 'charged', 'much', 'electricity', 'playing', 'electric', 'guitar', 'top', 'though', 'lizard', 'expert', 'quite', 'collection', 'When', 'one', 'lizards', 'up', 'missing', 'Thunderbolt', 'Buddha', 'picture', 'when', 'things', 'get', 'even', 'more', 'bizarre.This', 'movie', 'weird', 'little', '55', 'minutes', 'Calling', 'film', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'place', 'considering', 'length', 'best', 'way', 'describe', 'saying', 'extended', 'music', 'video', 'spliced', 'live', 'action', 'anime', 'manga', 'was', 'reading', 'up', 'film', 'origin', 'apparently', 'director', 'used', 'leftover', 'funds', 'previous', 'film', 'make', 'one', 'Even', 'using', 'two', 'main', 'actors', 'same', 'film', 'Gojoe', 'Spirit', 'War', 'Chronicle', 'may', 'be', 'case', 'alone', 'own', 'film', 'film', 'biggest', 'strength', 'way', 'was', 'shot', 'entirely', 'shot', 'black', 'white', 'style', 'just', 'bleed', 'off', 'screen', 'most', 'unique', 'shots', 'tend', 'be', 'when', 'Dragon', 'Eye', 'playing', 'guitar', 'lighting', 'perspective', 'are', 'just', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'someone', 'taking', 'frustrations', 'out', 'guitar', 'tend', 'be', 'face', 'scene', 'last', 'half', 'film', 'where', 'Thunderbolt', 'Buddha', 'something', 'get', 'Dragon', 'Eye', 'full', 'attention', 'where', 'Dragon', 'Eye', 'moving', 'rooms', 'moving', 'just', 'floating', 'room', 'room', 'just', 'viewer', 'realize', 'what', 'feeling', 'particular', 'moment', 'film', 'sort', 'bad', 'dream.The', 'music', 'may', 'be', 'what', 'breaks', 'film', 'viewer', 'walk', 'thin', 'line', 'being', 'kinda', 'catchy', 'just', 'being', 'distorted', 'noise', 'screaming', 'film', 'loud', 'sense', 'word', 'Whenever', 'Dragon', 'Eye', 'play', 'guitar', 'just', 'lot', 'noise', 'fit', 'film', 'would', 'make', 'sense', 'someone', 'was', 'channeling', '80,000', 'volts', 'electricity', 'guitar', 'would', 'probably', 'sound', 'more', 'something', 'bit', 'more', 'polished', 'someone', 'was', ""n't"", 'fan', 'loud', 'heavy', 'music', 'then', 'may', 'affect', 'judgement', 'film.Electric', 'Dragon', '80,000', 'V', 'more', 'bizarre', 'black', 'white', 'experiment', 'anything', 'else', 'bright', 'side', 'original', 'not', 'based', 'anything', 'remake', 'anything', 'own', 'two', 'legs', 'saying', 'something', 'days', 'originality', 'may', 'be', 'downfall', 'viewers', 'manga', 'practically', 'flow', 'frame', 'surrounding', 'loud', 'heavy', 'guitar', 'riffs', ""'re"", 'fan', 'previous', 'Tadanobu', 'Asano', 'films', 'are', 'mood', 'something', 'unique', ""'d"", 'highly', 'recommend', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'just', 'anyone', 'may', 'be', 'so', 'bizarre', ""'d"", 'wind', 'up', 'going', 'lot', 'people', 'heads.Rating', '7/10']",N/A
