682331,AQUU8S55JGY2H,B00005TPLW,Aco,"[3, 5]","This is a fun, wild and well done look at an ensemble of friends and neighbors, Hollywood folks/artists as they gather at The Anniversary Party of actress Sally (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and novelist/first-time director Joe (Alan Cumming).I enjoyed the writing and varied make up of the ensemble. Kevin Kline, his wife Pheobe Cates and their two kids play themselves, save for names. Kline's dance with his daughter, during the scene where the guests offer toasts or perform for the couple, was great. One of the best scenes. John C. Reilly and Jane Adams play a couple too, she a neurotic mother, he a director-possibly in too deep. John Benjamin Hickey plays Sally's manager and is terrific, intensely competetive and funny, mixed with his nutty wife Parker Posey. Gwyneth Paltrow, Jennifer Beals, Mina Badie, Michael Panes and Denis O'Hare round out the ensemble, to interesting, fun, deep and painful levels.Perhaps the oddest factor was the believability of Joe being married to Sally. Thankfully Cumming and Leigh deal with Cumming's homosexual history, when his old boyfriend toasts the couple. But their marriage is very much the subject, as are the relationships of the rest of the ensemble, and though some clearly are in good shape, while others are mystifying, such an investigation of marriage and love and Hollywood/artists make this a worthwhile film.",4,"Photos, Dr. X, the dog Otis, Novelist, Actors, a pool.....",1104796800,"01 4, 2005",2005,1363,"['fun', 'wild', 'well', 'done', 'look', 'ensemble', 'friends', 'neighbors', 'Hollywood', 'folks/artists', 'gather', 'Anniversary', 'Party', 'actress', 'Sally', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'novelist/first-time', 'director', 'Joe', 'Alan', 'Cumming', '.I', 'enjoyed', 'writing', 'varied', 'make', 'ensemble', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'wife', 'Pheobe', 'Cates', 'two', 'kids', 'play', 'save', 'names', 'Kline', 'dance', 'daughter', 'scene', 'where', 'guests', 'offer', 'toasts', 'perform', 'couple', 'was', 'great', 'One', 'best', 'scenes', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'Jane', 'Adams', 'play', 'couple', 'too', 'neurotic', 'mother', 'director-possibly', 'too', 'deep', 'John', 'Benjamin', 'Hickey', 'Sally', 'manager', 'terrific', 'intensely', 'competetive', 'funny', 'mixed', 'nutty', 'wife', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'Jennifer', 'Beals', 'Mina', 'Badie', 'Michael', 'Panes', 'Denis', ""O'Hare"", 'out', 'ensemble', 'interesting', 'fun', 'deep', 'painful', 'levels.Perhaps', 'oddest', 'factor', 'was', 'believability', 'Joe', 'being', 'married', 'Sally', 'Thankfully', 'Cumming', 'Leigh', 'deal', 'Cumming', 'homosexual', 'history', 'when', 'old', 'boyfriend', 'couple', 'marriage', 'very', 'much', 'subject', 'are', 'relationships', 'rest', 'ensemble', 'clearly', 'are', 'good', 'shape', 'others', 'are', 'mystifying', 'investigation', 'marriage', 'love', 'Hollywood/artists', 'make', 'worthwhile', 'film']",N/A

Jennifer Jason Leigh & Alan Cumming have written and directed an excellent take on the Hollywood lifestyle and skewer it magically in the process.  They're in on the joke.  I agree with the other reviewer that compared ""Anniversary Party"" to ""Don's Party.""  Alcohol sends that early 80s (?) Australian effort off in an unforeseen direction; Ecstasy does the job here.  Kudos to whoever chose the music to accompany the pool scene after the Ecstasy takes hold.  It captures the mood perfectly.Two favorite scenes (both involve Kevin Kline - excellent in this close to real-life role with real wife Phoebe Cates & their two young children):a. The 'tribute' dance that he and his daughter perform in honor of ""Joe and Sally"" is simply magical.  [You'll get a kick out of his faux hogging of the limelight after the performance].b. Kline again - waltes into the kitchen to thank the chef (named 'America') with an off-the-cuff, under-the-breath ditty to the tune of 'America the Beautiful' that goes something like...""America, America, the food was so yum-my; I'm looking for a dish or bowl, to hold the Ec-stasy.""Definitely worth a rental (and don't be frightened by this digital video talk; the film looks not at all grainy...it's as creamy as anything else you'll rent these days).",4,They're in on the joke folks...,1012867200,"02 5, 2002",2002,1417,"['earlier', 'review', 'said', 'something', 'effect', 'do', 'realize', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'stupid', 'Hollywood', 'lives', 'Yes', 'do', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'Alan', 'Cumming', 'have', 'written', 'directed', 'excellent', 'take', 'Hollywood', 'lifestyle', 'skewer', 'magically', 'process', ""'re"", 'joke', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewer', 'compared', 'Anniversary', 'Party', 'Don', 'Party', 'Alcohol', 'early', '80s', 'Australian', 'effort', 'off', 'unforeseen', 'direction', 'Ecstasy', 'job', 'here', 'Kudos', 'whoever', 'chose', 'music', 'accompany', 'pool', 'scene', 'Ecstasy', 'hold', 'mood', 'perfectly.Two', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'involve', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'excellent', 'close', 'real-life', 'role', 'real', 'wife', 'Phoebe', 'Cates', 'two', 'young', 'children', ""'tribute"", 'dance', 'daughter', 'perform', 'honor', 'Joe', 'Sally', 'simply', 'magical', '[', ""'ll"", 'get', 'kick', 'faux', 'hogging', 'limelight', 'performance', ']', '.b', 'Kline', 'again', 'kitchen', 'thank', 'chef', 'named', ""'America"", 'off-the-cuff', 'under-the-breath', 'ditty', 'tune', 'Beautiful', 'something', 'America', 'America', 'food', 'was', 'so', 'yum-my', ""'m"", 'looking', 'dish', 'bowl', 'hold', 'Ec-stasy', 'Definitely', 'rental', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'frightened', 'digital', 'video', 'talk', 'film', 'not', 'grainy', 'as', 'creamy', 'anything', 'else', ""'ll"", 'rent', 'days']",N/A

The premise: a recently reconciled Hollywood couple throws an anniversary party and invites all of their quirky celebrity friends. The plot is not terribly appealing and is structured similar to a play, being immobile with setting. The writing is quite good, but the characters are not easily relatable, and not as funny as it seems they were intended to be. The cast is excellent though. Cumming, Leigh, John C. Riley, Parker Posey, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Kline, Phoebe Cates, and some other lesser known actors and actresses contribute to making this film intriguing, in spite of the lack of action or movement in plot. It is an admirable accomplishment for the team of writers, and I loved seeing Alan Cumming perform so brilliantly, especially in his own work, but I can't say I took too much out of the movie.

Jennifer Jason Leigh has never been quite this good as the wife of the couple whose 6th anniversary is marked by an LA house party that gradually goes all wrong on ecstasy and jealousy. Very smart script concocted by the two co-stars, with an almost all-star cast of some of Hollywood's smartest people. Gwenyth Paltrow is pitch perfect as the slightly ditsy starlet who will play the lead in the sexually ambiguous husband's screen adaptation of his novel. The toasting scene, when all present toast the couple, is the film's classic centerpiece. The next-door couple is also great, especially the uptight husband who can't drink, but really needs to to loosen up.

682337,A3SOV9HFM5H9T1,B00005TPLW,Bruce P. Barten,"[2, 7]","I don't see enough movies to go into a lot of details about plot.  This one looks like some famous people with digital cameras decided to shoot a movie of whatever they do best when they aren't following a script.  The commentary admits that the greatest variety in the movie is an extended scene of toasts, in which most of the major characters had the responsibility of drafting their own comments about the celebrating couple, or why a dog whistle should be considered an appropriate gift, whatever.Actually, I see so few movies that John C. Reilly and Kevin Kline were the only male actors I recognized immediately, expecting them to look as familiar as their names.  The Peter Sellers look-alike was outstanding in whatever role he managed to adapt to in the film.  So great, it is almost as if the writers realized that they knew someone who could do Peter Sellers so well that they could make a movie that could have been a Peter Sellers movie back in his day.  Kevin Kline was reciting from the end of the poem &quot;Dover Beach&quot; by Matthew Arnold instead of doing an original toast, but he was old enough to seem like a relic compared to the rest of the cast, and that poem is top-notch relic material.The women in this film are so wonderful that most of my life, I was hardly aware such women existed.  Parker Posey was the one I have seen most often.  The cast information on the DVD listed movies that were worth checking for the years in which these actresses played high school girls in their previous movies. The tension between these women, now that they are old enough to really want something or someone of their own, gets worked over in a number of different ways.  After watching the movie a few times, my favorite moment was when they left the front door open and Gwyneth Paltrow walked in.  I have no idea why I have not been going to all her movies.  Pretty soon she has to apologize for gushing.

682340,A51IK68MWKV5R,B00005TPLW,"Craig Clarke ""Somebody Dies""","[10, 11]","This debut from the unlikely team of Alan Cumming and Jennifer Jason Leigh is the most uncomfortable experience I have had watching a film in a while.  Not Requiem for a Dream discomfort by any means, just an emotional tension that makes you feel for the characters.This is not to say that it is a bad film.  This is in fact not so.  The reason it is an uncomfortable experience is that the directors are so good in expressing the discomfort the characters feel that the viewer feels it, too.It mainly concerns the couple played by Cumming and Leigh, who have been separated for a considerable time (following their fifth anniversary) and have not yet figured out how to live with each other again.  Their scenes are filled with tension combined with genuine love and effort in wanting to stay together.The story takes place during one day and night of the preparation and then execution of a party for their sixth wedding anniversary.  Cumming plays a novelist who has just been asked to direct his screenplay of his latest novel.  The lead character of Jesse is well-known to have been based upon Leigh when she was younger.  The leads Leigh, an famous actress in her own right, to feel she is the perfect person for the part.  However, Cumming, through some coercion from the studio, has decided to hire the Gwyneth Paltrow character to play the part instead, telling her on the phone (overheard by Leigh) that she is his only choice for the role.  He then invites Paltrow to their anniversary party, balked at by Leigh, who ""didn't even invite my own mother.""In addition, everyone involved with Leigh's current film seems to believe, unbeknownst to her, that due to her emotional stresses, she is just ""phoning it in.""  This opinion is supported when the director watches some dailies on the couple's widescreen television set.Also invited, for no other reason it seems than to provide conflict, are the next door neighbors, who bring with them their opinions on the couple's dog who apparently barks incessantly, yet we never hear it.Kevin Kline, Leigh's current costar, and his wife, played by his wife, actress Phoebe Cates (at her best in a later scene with Leigh), arrive with their two children, played by...their two children.  Unfortunately, the family members appear to have no chemistry with each other.  If I had not known, I would have thought they were all strangers (except for the children, who look remarkably like each other, and remarkably unlike either parent).  The son falsettos an instantly forgettable song (said in the credits to have been written by him) that is obviously supposed to be cute, but was probably left in to save egos.(You probably remember that Cates was in Fast Times in Ridgemont High with Leigh.  The film, in fact, seems to be a reunion of sorts.  Most of the actresses were in Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle with Leigh, as well.  And Leigh's own dog plays the couple's dog, Otis.  I don't know if Cumming brought any friends of his to this ""Party,"" other than Leigh, of course.)All the different guests, including Leigh's current director (John C. Reilly) and his wife, the couple's tax attorney (there for no other reasons than to make sure they sign their forms and to call another guest a body part vulgarity during a particularly tense game of charades) and his wife, Cumming's best friend Jennifer Beals, and the aforementioned Paltrow finally arrive and everyone is uncomfortable for a while.Eventually the tension breaks--somewhat--and we see several guests dedicating toasts to the couple, with varying degrees of success, and Paltrow (at her most radiant in this role) presenting a gift of Ecstasy, enough for every guest.  This changes the mood of the film somewhat as everyone has different reactions to the drug (including one woman remaining mostly nude for the remainder of the film).This mood continues through a lot of drug-induced behavior which, I have to say, did not do much for my opinion of recreational drug use.  I'm definitely still against it, even though everyone looked as if they were having a great time.Surprisingly, this mishmash of tensions and personality quirks works to make a really entertaining film.

The entire craft of filmmaking is based on ""Look at me/us, aren't I/we wonderful?"" whether you are an actor OR director, so let's not overstate the obvious. Jennifer Jason Leigh and Alan Cumming's One Night In The Life of a writer-director/actress couple celebrating thier anniversary with a dozen of thier ""closest"" show-biz friends is quite entertaining. Very similar in tone to the obscure 80's Austrailian film ""Don's Party"", the main difference being the Truth Drug of choice...at Don's party, it was that good ol' standby-liquor...in this case, it's the eagerly gobbled ""ecstasy"" tablets that bring out the inevitable sniping and backbiting amongst the ""friends"" by party's end. The film has a loose, improvised Cassavettes vibe that may turn off viewers with short attention spans. Good ensemble work (for the most part) from the likes of John C. Reilly, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jennifer Beals and Parker Posey keep things perking. Kevin Kline and Phoebe Cates (and thier real life kids) are standouts, although they are basically playing themselves! The Peter Sellers look-a-like gag is a hoot for cinema buffs.

682346,A1Y1YRO74S6ELA,B00005TPLW,"GreatWriterChrisJames ""ChrisJames""","[1, 6]","The anniversary party by first time directors Alan Cumming and Jennifer Jason Leigh is attempt to create an intellectual and emotional film about an engaged couple with maritalproblems who have a party with friends and neighbors to come to grips with their lives. Well at least that's what the script says. But in reality ""The Anniversary Party"" is a weak, predictable, typical yuppie film filled with predictable storylines and outcomes, and filled with horrible characters that you don't really care to know about from beginning to end. With the exception of Jennifer Jason Leigh as Sally Nash (She's excellent in the film) all the other actors and characters in the film are terrible and pathetic, with Gwenyth Paltrow leading the way  Skye Davidson. Even myself, who has no directing experience could have directed and made a better film. One of the reasons the film is so badly made is because it's a Hollywood film made by Hollywood people, so the film's director lack both the emotional and mature insight to create real and loving characters.Alan Cumming plays  Joe Therrian while Jennifer Jason Leigh plays  Sally Nash , 1 couple living in an highly rich area of Los Angeles, however, both characters or should one character is destroying the relationship with one another, even thoughthe couple wants to get engaged.Joe Therrian is basically a womanizing, airhead, conceded, and stupid sexist pig, who has cheated on Sally Nash before. He has asked Sally to take him back and Sally being very weak (that's her only flaw in the film, but she is real and lovable) takes him back. Joe is also supposed to be a noted film director and authoralthough John C. Reilly.... Mac Forsyth ugh he hasn't really done anything special. Sally Nash (Leigh) is an actress in her mid 40's who is contemplating, removing Joe from her life, or to stay with this pitiful guy and try to gain some sort of relationship. She is even thinking of having a baby with this jerk which is totally ridiculous, because Joe throughout the film literally makes an ass of himself time and time again.Sally is currently hoping to be a film with one of Joe's friends  Mac Forsyth  (John Reilly). But unbeknowst to Sally that Mac (also being an idiot) is talking behind Sally's back and telling her friends that she no acting skills. Eventually, Joe and Sally have an Annivesary Party, and we meet even more pathetic and disgusting characters to feast on eyes on.There's Gwenyth Paltrow playing Skye Davidson, an airhead actress who wants to get to close to Joe to further her career (She'll sleep her way to the top I guess). Then there's Jennifer Beals (who hasn't done anything special since Flashdance) as  Gina Taylor a successful artist who also wants to sleep with Joe (and Joe knows it, even going as far as flirting with Gina right in front of Sally).Then there's Kevin Kline as  Cal Gold and Phoebe Cates as Sophia Gold, Sally's supposed friends, even Cal with Mac is talking behind Sally's back like a damn coward (Great job by Kline playing the coward).I could go on and on about the guests, but I think you get the point that none of the ""guests"" are worth giving a damn about, letting alone talking about.The conflict (and the action finally comes) when Sally catches Joe in a comprising position and she starts to tackle the decision of whether to dump this piece of garbage or to keep this piece of garbage. However, by the end of the film, Sally as I said she is weak, doesn't really doesn't do  what I thought a 100% feminine woman would do, and the movie delivers a pathetic ending that I could I see a mile away.There is a DVD with a bunch of features for the film, but with the film so badly done and directed, I'am not even going to bother discussing them.All I can say is that Jennifer Jason Leigh and Alan Cummings or should I say Jennifer Jason Leigh (The film has a woman's touch while Cumming's influence is nonexistent)  has a lot of learning to do to become a serious director.",1,Director Jennifer Jason and Alan Cummings flop,1096588800,"10 1, 2004",2004,3977,"['anniversary', 'party', 'first', 'time', 'directors', 'Alan', 'Cumming', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'attempt', 'create', 'intellectual', 'emotional', 'film', 'engaged', 'couple', 'maritalproblems', 'who', 'have', 'party', 'friends', 'neighbors', 'come', 'grips', 'lives', 'Well', 'least', 'what', 'script', 'reality', 'Anniversary', 'Party', 'weak', 'predictable', 'typical', 'yuppie', 'film', 'filled', 'predictable', 'storylines', 'outcomes', 'filled', 'horrible', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'know', 'beginning', 'end', 'exception', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'Sally', 'Nash', 'excellent', 'film', 'other', 'actors', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'terrible', 'pathetic', 'Gwenyth', 'Paltrow', 'leading', 'way', 'Skye', 'Davidson', 'Even', 'who', 'directing', 'experience', 'could', 'have', 'directed', 'made', 'better', 'film', 'One', 'reasons', 'film', 'so', 'badly', 'made', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'made', 'Hollywood', 'people', 'film', 'director', 'lack', 'emotional', 'mature', 'insight', 'create', 'real', 'loving', 'characters.Alan', 'Cumming', 'Joe', 'Therrian', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'Sally', 'Nash', '1', 'couple', 'living', 'highly', 'rich', 'area', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'however', 'characters', 'should', 'one', 'character', 'destroying', 'relationship', 'one', 'even', 'thoughthe', 'couple', 'get', 'engaged.Joe', 'Therrian', 'basically', 'womanizing', 'airhead', 'conceded', 'stupid', 'sexist', 'pig', 'who', 'cheated', 'Sally', 'Nash', 'before', 'asked', 'Sally', 'take', 'back', 'Sally', 'being', 'very', 'weak', 'only', 'flaw', 'film', 'real', 'lovable', 'back', 'Joe', 'also', 'supposed', 'be', 'noted', 'film', 'director', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'Mac', 'Forsyth', ""n't"", 'really', 'done', 'anything', 'special', 'Sally', 'Nash', 'Leigh', 'actress', 'mid', '40', 'who', 'contemplating', 'removing', 'Joe', 'life', 'stay', 'pitiful', 'guy', 'try', 'gain', 'sort', 'relationship', 'even', 'thinking', 'having', 'baby', 'jerk', 'totally', 'ridiculous', 'Joe', 'film', 'literally', 'ass', 'time', 'time', 'again.Sally', 'currently', 'hoping', 'be', 'film', 'one', 'Joe', 'friends', 'Mac', 'Forsyth', 'John', 'Reilly', 'unbeknowst', 'Sally', 'Mac', 'also', 'being', 'idiot', 'talking', 'Sally', 'back', 'telling', 'friends', 'acting', 'skills', 'Eventually', 'Joe', 'Sally', 'have', 'Annivesary', 'Party', 'meet', 'even', 'more', 'pathetic', 'disgusting', 'characters', 'feast', 'eyes', 'Gwenyth', 'Paltrow', 'playing', 'Skye', 'Davidson', 'airhead', 'actress', 'who', 'get', 'close', 'Joe', 'further', 'career', ""'ll"", 'sleep', 'way', 'top', 'guess', 'Then', 'Jennifer', 'Beals', 'who', ""n't"", 'done', 'anything', 'special', 'Flashdance', 'Gina', 'Taylor', 'successful', 'artist', 'who', 'also', 'sleep', 'Joe', 'Joe', 'even', 'going', 'as', 'far', 'flirting', 'Gina', 'right', 'front', 'Sally', '.Then', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'Cal', 'Gold', 'Phoebe', 'Cates', 'Sophia', 'Gold', 'Sally', 'supposed', 'friends', 'even', 'Cal', 'Mac', 'talking', 'Sally', 'back', 'damn', 'coward', 'Great', 'job', 'Kline', 'playing', 'coward', '.I', 'could', 'go', 'guests', 'think', 'get', 'point', 'none', 'guests', 'are', 'worth', 'giving', 'damn', 'letting', 'alone', 'talking', 'about.The', 'conflict', 'action', 'finally', 'when', 'Sally', 'Joe', 'comprising', 'position', 'tackle', 'decision', 'dump', 'piece', 'garbage', 'keep', 'piece', 'garbage', 'However', 'end', 'film', 'Sally', 'said', 'weak', ""n't"", 'really', ""n't"", 'do', 'what', 'thought', '100', '%', 'feminine', 'woman', 'would', 'do', 'movie', 'pathetic', 'ending', 'could', 'see', 'mile', 'DVD', 'bunch', 'features', 'film', 'film', 'so', 'badly', 'done', 'directed', ""I'am"", 'not', 'even', 'going', 'bother', 'discussing', 'can', 'say', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'Alan', 'Cummings', 'should', 'say', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'film', 'woman', 'touch', 'Cumming', 'influence', 'nonexistent', 'lot', 'learning', 'do', 'become', 'serious', 'director']",N/A

Gelwasser,"[1, 4]","""The Anniversary Party"" is one of those small, enjoyable, indie films, that you can watch over and over again and with each repeated viewing find new details, plot points and lines of witty dialogue, that come to the viewer's attention.In this comedy/drama, we meet Joe (Alan Cumming) and Sally (Jennifer Jason Leigh), who are celebrating their sixth wedding anniversary with a party held in their beautiful, modern, LA home. At first, they seem like the perfect celebrity couple. Sally is a famous Hollywood actress with a distinguished career. Joe is a renown author, who has just gotten the studio greenlight to direct his first movie, based on one of his novels.The party begins and little by little, we start to meet the guests, who are mostly in the arts or the Hollywood film industry. Everyone has their own professional and personal connections to Sally and Joe, that are slowly revealed. Like most friends and acquaintances, they bring to the party, their own quirky personalities, neuroses and agendas. As the evening gets going, liquor starts flowing easily and ectasy is passed around. This leads to folks opening up and revelations being made about the hosts. We begin to find out, that this 'picture perfect' Hollywood couple has more than their share of marital problems. The couple has recently spent time apart. There have been past problems with both infidelity and drugs. While the celebration of their wedding anniversary was suppose to be a new begining for the couple, it really just serves as a catalyst to bring their problems to the forefront and reveal just how much trouble the relationship truely is in.This is one of those small movies, where just everything comes together. The film was written and directed by actors, Alan Cummings and Jennifer Jason Leigh. Its' conversational, witty dialogue, keeps you interested and wanting more. The film gives you a real 'fly on the wall' feeling of attending an intimate Hollywood party in a beautiful, LA home.In addition, the film has a wonderful, ensemble cast, which includes Kevin Kline, Phoebe Cates, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jennifer Beals, Parker Posey, John C. Reilly and Jane Adams. These actors have created a really interesting variety of characters, who can be both likable or not. With an interesting cast of character actors such as this, how can you not want to hang around at the party and hope, that it lasts just a little bit longer?

682354,A1MXIZY6XV8DUG,B00005TPLW,Kyle Garrett,"[0, 1]","""The Anniversary Party""reeks of ""Don's Party"",that Aussie dramedy from the 70s where truths spill out unexpectedly, relationships become altered and/or re-analyzed. So this movie isn't original by any means but it's definately a sight better than ""The Big Chill"",that other ensemble movie that also had Kevin Kline. But where the characters in ""The Big Chill""were somewhat likeable, Cumming and Leigh(perhaps by design)have made almost every character the last person you'd ever want to meet. And while this is part of the joke,you can't help but be a bit uncaring about them when affected by tragedy. Jennifer Beals along with Mina Badie seem to be the only characters who're sincere about being at the gathering. You actually feel for Beal's character when she interacts with Cumming in one of the more heavy scenes. Also,as funny and smarmy the jokes were,they still seemed a bit forced just like some of the acting and dialogue. So much so that the Leigh/Cates kitchen scene almost mirrors thier lunch hour/carrot scene from ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" 20 years ago:Cates chewing up the scene and Leigh just barely catching up to show off her chops. Cumming is rather interesting as the man-child writer and works well with the rest of the cast,although he too has a couple of scenes where the overacting gets too thick. I felt bad for Parker Posey ,Jane Adams and John C.Reilly as thier roles could've almost been phoned in. Still,I've been a fan of Posey since ""Clockwatchers"" and ""Kicking and Screaming""so any camera time is good camera time in my book. The pacing of the movie ebbs and flows,just like the energy of any other party you've ever attended but the last 1/3 stumbles a bit. The commentary on the DVD provides huge insight into how the film was made and what went into making the script(deemed ""amazingly effortless"" by Leigh) All in all,it's not going to set the indie film industry on fire but it's still an engaging and enjoyable movie. And it was rather clever for Leigh and Cumming to bring in thier closest friends from both ""Fast Times"" and ""Dorothy Parker and the Vicious Circle"" as a sort of inside joke.",3,A good flick but....,1016582400,"03 20, 2002",2002,2135,"['Anniversary', 'Party', 'reeks', 'Don', 'Party', 'Aussie', 'dramedy', '70s', 'where', 'truths', 'spill', 'out', 'unexpectedly', 'become', 'altered', 'and/or', 're-analyzed', 'movie', ""n't"", 'original', 'means', 'definately', 'sight', 'better', 'Big', 'Chill', 'other', 'ensemble', 'movie', 'also', 'had', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'where', 'characters', 'Big', 'Chill', 'were', 'somewhat', 'likeable', 'Cumming', 'Leigh', 'perhaps', 'design', 'have', 'made', 'almost', 'character', 'last', 'person', ""'d"", 'ever', 'want', 'meet', 'part', 'joke', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'bit', 'uncaring', 'when', 'affected', 'tragedy', 'Jennifer', 'Beals', 'Mina', 'Badie', 'seem', 'be', 'only', 'characters', 'who', ""'re"", 'sincere', 'being', 'gathering', 'actually', 'feel', 'Beal', 'character', 'when', 'Cumming', 'one', 'more', 'heavy', 'scenes', 'Also', 'funny', 'jokes', 'were', 'still', 'seemed', 'bit', 'forced', 'just', 'acting', 'dialogue', 'So', 'much', 'Leigh/Cates', 'kitchen', 'scene', 'almost', 'mirrors', 'thier', 'lunch', 'hour/carrot', 'scene', 'Fast', 'Times', 'Ridgemont', 'High', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'Cates', 'chewing', 'up', 'scene', 'Leigh', 'just', 'barely', 'catching', 'up', 'show', 'off', 'chops', 'Cumming', 'rather', 'interesting', 'man-child', 'writer', 'well', 'rest', 'cast', 'too', 'couple', 'scenes', 'where', 'overacting', 'too', 'thick', 'felt', 'bad', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'Jane', 'Adams', 'John', 'C.Reilly', 'thier', 'roles', 'could', ""'ve"", 'almost', 'been', 'phoned', 'Still', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'Posey', 'Clockwatchers', 'Kicking', 'Screaming', 'camera', 'time', 'good', 'camera', 'time', 'book', 'pacing', 'movie', 'ebbs', 'just', 'energy', 'other', 'party', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'attended', 'last', '1/3', 'stumbles', 'bit', 'commentary', 'DVD', 'huge', 'insight', 'how', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'what', 'went', 'making', 'script', 'deemed', 'amazingly', 'effortless', 'Leigh', 'All', 'not', 'going', 'set', 'indie', 'film', 'industry', 'fire', 'still', 'engaging', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'was', 'rather', 'clever', 'Leigh', 'Cumming', 'bring', 'thier', 'closest', 'friends', 'Fast', 'Times', 'Dorothy', 'Parker', 'Vicious', 'Circle', 'sort', 'inside', 'joke']",N/A

682356,A1DZKOOMMJM1MI,B00005TPLW,"Mark Twain ""Sam""","[5, 8]","Jennifer Jason Leigh and Alan Cumming wrote, directed and star in this riveting, engrossing, and believable study of marriage. Taking place over the course of one night, ""The Anniversary Party"" is a serio-comic, sometimes scathing inspection of a group of friends. Joe and Sally Therrian (Leigh and Cumming) have a party to celebrate several important junctures in their marriage: their sixth anniversary, their decision to start a family and their reconciliation after a yearlong separation. They have invited their closest friends, their past and current temptations, and (to avoid a lawsuit) their contentious neighbors. An unexpected gift sends the party spiraling out of control and unleashes an explosion of painful confessions. The celebration becomes a scorching dissection of a marriage on the brink. Leigh and Cumming wrote the movie for their friends to star in; it was shot in 19 days in one location, using digital video cameras.""The Anniversary Party"" was clearly conceived to be an actor's movie, an opportunity for Leigh and Cumming's circle of friends to stretch out, dig in and show what they can do, and every performer rises to the occasion. The picture has the relaxed feel of an actors' exercise, but one that's interesting every moment. There are slack patches in the writing here and there, but the players whisk you through them so artfully that you barely notice them. It's rare to see an ensemble so consistently on the mark: Even when they aren't doing much, they're a joy to watch. Cumming plays a British novelist with a few hits under his belt; he's about to take a shot at directing his first movie. Leigh is his wife, a high-strung but respected film actress. The couple have just reconciled after a yearlong separation, and they've decided to celebrate their sixth anniversary with a party at their glamorously austere Los Angeles home; they're also trying to conceive a child. That simple premise sets the stage for the latent conflicts between Cumming and Leigh to rush to the surface. It also allows for the gradual unfurling of the multitentacled relationships each of them has with the guests at the party -- many of them other couples. One couple, Parker Posey and John Benjamin Hickey, are the pair's tense business managers, overtly anxious about Cumming and Leigh's shaky finances and subconsciously anxious about their own wobbly marriage.John C. Reilly is a successful, respected film director -- Leigh is starring in his latest movie and, it appears, simply phoning in the performance, much to his frustration. Reilly's wife, Jane Adams, is a nervous, birdlike actress who has just given birth to the couple's first child and is trying to keep her career going nonetheless. Kevin Kline and Phoebe Cates play married actors who are also busy raising a family; Kline is still working (starring opposite Leigh in Reilly's film), but Cates, who is Leigh's best friend, has retired from acting to raise the couple's two children.The other party guests include Gwyneth Paltrow (wonderful), a big star who has agreed to star in Cumming's movie, which is a grand coup for him; Denis O'Hare and Mina Badie as the couple's meddling, lawsuit-happy neighbors; Jennifer Beals as an old friend of Cumming's of whom Leigh is bitterly jealous; and Michael Panes as one of the couple's random pals, a gifted violinist and self-acknowledged Peter Sellers look-alike.The all-star cast and crisp, bright dialogue alone make ""The Anniversary Party"" a ""trip"" worth taking.

682357,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00005TPLW,Matthew Horner,"[7, 10]","The Anniversary Party was dismissed in some circles as a vanity project since two well-known actors, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Alan Cumming, not only wrote and directed it, but also starred in it and cast their friends in the other roles. The problem with the dismissal it that it assumes that all so-called vanity projects, which I don't think The Anniversary Project really is, are bad news. My belief is that any movie should be judged on its own merits, not by the in and outs of how and why it was made.I think this is one of the best and most insightful pictures ever made about people who work in the movie business. It is also an intimate, bittersweet portrait of the relationship between a movie star, whose career has peaked, and her writer husband, whose own success is just beginning to soar.It is not an action movie. The whole thing takes place in a 24-hour period during which the couple throws a party to celebrate their sixth wedding anniversary. It is a low budget movie, shot on digital video, then transferred to film stock. It has a literate script but is not what I consider to be high brow. In fact, it's decidedly earthy and contains a great deal of scathing humor. If you aren't interested in Hollywood types or if you don't care for slice of life stories that delve into the darker elements of a relationship, this one isn't for you.Sally and Joe [Leigh and Cumming] may have made it as a couple for six years, but it's been a rocky road. He left her and moved to London for a year. He's been back for six months. An underlying tension remains between them. On the morning of the party we find them outside by their pool getting instructions from their yoga teacher. Meanwhile, two maids prepare for the party. We see that Sally and Joe are rather spoiled. Joe has writing a new novel and has been chosen to direct the film version of it. Though he claims that it's a work of fiction, everyone knows that the main character is based on Sally. She isn't pleased that rising young star Skye Davidson [Gwyneth Paltrow] has been cast as this character, but the sad fact is that Sally is really to old to play her. In the afternoon, guests begin to arrive, and an interesting assortment of people they are. As the movie progresses, we see how intertwined these people's lives are and how codependent they are on each other. We see how the bonds of friendship can sometimes be a mixed blessing. As day turns into night, the party guests, having consumed quite a bit of wine, become looser and looser. When Skye gives the couple several hits of the drug Ecstasy as an anniversary gift, they pass them around to their guests. Secrets and lies come out that will forever change Sally and Joe, though not necessarily for the worse. The movie leaves it up to the audience to decide if their relationship will survive.Vanity project or not, Leigh and Cumming are right on the money about a certain segment of Hollywood. I lived in Los Angeles for seven years, and some of the movie seems so real that I began to feel like one of the guests instead of an audience member. It is easy to dismiss people in the business as being neurotically insecure. While insecurity seems to be built into artistic types, I found that part of the problem for the ones who make movies for a living is that every job they take is temporary. This unavoidable fact tends to make them see everything as short-lived.There are too many great performances here to singles any one out. This is an ensemble piece.The photography is some of the best work in digital video I have seen so far. This process is revolutionizing movies because it is drastically lowering the cost. How much cheaper is it? The standard film stock used in The Anniversary Party's three-minute underwater sequence cost more than the digital stock used in the rest of the movie. It cut in half the time required to shoot the movie.

682359,A27PSZX2SE0B51,B00005TPLW,Mike Stone,"[8, 11]","I was expecting ""The Anniversary Party"", co-written and co-directed by Alan Cumming and Jennifer Jason Leigh, to be a loosely-scripted, improv-heavy excuse for a bunch of their actor friends to get together in front of the camera and show off their instruments.  What I found instead was a semi-tightly plotted dissection of a marriage teetering on the brink of dissolution, a commentary on the nature of celebrity in a celebrity-saturated market, and a worthy exhibition of exhilaration and pathos.  That is until the film's last hour, which degenerates into a loosely-scripted, improv-heavy excuse for a bunch of actors friends to get together in front of the camera and show off their instruments.  Ad nauseum.Simply structured into five easily-defined segments, the film begins with many gestures of goodwill, which are slowly stripped away as it refuses to finally end.The prologue introduces Joe Therrian (Cumming) and Sally Nash (Leigh).  The first shots of the film feature a sleeping Cumming being observed by Leigh in bed, on the morning of their sixth wedding anniversary.  This segues into a quiet little scene where they both do yoga in the backyard.  These two moments, as well as a later bedroom scene, establish the pair's relationship instantly, while also subtly alluding to important plot points to come.  This is the film's strength, its use of moments and details, picked up only by the most observant viewer, that define character instantly and allude to moments to come.  It is because of this that the film holds up well on second viewing.The next segment shows Joe and Sally greeting their various guests as they arrive for the anniversary party.  Just as Joe and Sally are introduced in tableau during the film's first scenes, so do these short moments explicate the well-defined relationships between the guests and their hosts.  It's the kind of crowd that features both a recent Oscar winner, and a former Booker Prize recipient, a menagerie of talented and egocentric personalities that is vibrant and entertaining, promising at least some good times ahead.  For the most part, they deliver.Once everyone has arrived, the party begins, made up of two long sequences that do an awful lot in terms of defining character, and, especially in the second one, constructing Joe and Sally's backstory.The first is a rousing game of charades, that some take way too seriously (ratcheting up the tension) while others treat as a lark.  It's notable for the way relationships are further cemented, and for the way it sets new ones down a rocky path.The second sequence has everyone stand up in front of the crowd, one by one, presenting either a song or a joke or a dance number as an ode to Joe and Sally.  There were one too many songs, for my liking, especially since each said basically the same thing (we're glad you're back, Joe, don't ever leave our Sally again).  Kevin Kline and daughter do a wonderful balletic interpretive dance of Joe and Sally's marriage.  The little girl appears to be having the time of her life, adopting a mock serious face between bouts of cracking up.  Kline, to his credit, lets her steal the spotlight.  Mostly, this sequence is useful in that it manages to get all the things better left unsaid out in the open, as some of the guests inadvertently peel back the skin of the couple of the hour, the better to expose their inner wounds.It is dubious, however, for the last person to present, Paltrow's Davidson, thinks it a good deal to offer 15 capsules of Ecstasy to this erratic group.  From this point on, the film is a train wreck masquerading as theatre of the absurd.Now, I'm all for giving a repressed group, one with issues as delicious as these people's, an opportunity to bear their souls.  But when that opportunity is only achieved through chemistry, it feels like cheating to me.  The revelations are tainted in some way.  Which is exactly what happens here.The other problem is that this section of the movie goes on and on and on.  It tramples over nearly all the goodwill that Cumming and Leigh worked so hard to build up over the film's first half.  What was once a prudently structured little film, turns violently into a jumbled mess.  Most obnoxious here is Cumming and Leigh's little blow up scene.  Every other word is a curse; every line is punctuated by implausible hysterics and tears.  These are two wonderful actors, who've just finished proving that during the film's first half.  Poof.  All gone.  It's an unwatchable scene, one that a more seasoned director would have guided home much more ably.Once the Ecstasy has worn off (ironically, the ecstasy of the film wore off just as Ecstasy the drug made its appearance), the film can get down to the business of finally ending.  Hold your horses!  There's the denouement to consider.  Or was it an epilogue?  No matter.Where conventionally closure should exist, one last wrench is thrown into the works, and somehow, this brings peace and resolution to the characters.  I didn't think it possibly, but Cumming and Leigh almost save this mess.  Still, I didn't buy the peace and resolution this last bit brought on.  Thankfully, I suspect the filmmaker's don't either.  The last shot, which bears a striking resemblance to the film's first shot, shows that the issues are left unresolved.  What we have is a just a temporary ceasefire.In the end, ""The Anniversary Party"" is little more than a vanity piece by Cumming and Leigh, an opportunity to make a personal film on the cheap, about some particularly vain people.  Which, I suppose, makes the whole endeavor rather appropriate.  If you dare R.S.V.P. to this ""Party"", take my advice and leave just after the sun goes down.",3,An Ecstatic First Half; An Ecstasy-Ruined Second Half,1030320000,"08 26, 2002",2002,5709,"['was',

As you watch this movie keep in mind the following: this is a plot about artsy types in Hollywood - if you expect performing aspects of their talent, they are something, but as human beings they are nothing.  And to me, that was the entire conflict of this movie - how can people this talented be so shallow?  Example is Gwyneth Paltrow's character about up and coming Hollywood actress who is disliked by almost every woman in this bunch by the virtue of being young and pretty - she needs no other faults.  As men drool over her youth and unrestrained freedom that sometime bordelines with tactlessness, women seem to loath her.  How childlish one would think -- but Hollywood insecurities have no limits, right?If you are looking for strong character presentation, you will find in in Jennifer Beals' character - unpretentious and sincere. However even her human approach to the situations these people face is turned back because ""she is not the wife"".  For the goofball of them all, you will not be disappointed in John C. Reilly's performance.  It is  a treat to also see real life husband and wife Kevin Kline and Phoebe Cates mingle with this bunch with their down to earth approachability - totally unpretentious despite of the fact that Kline is quoting Shakespeare.While movie sometimes seems to drag indefinitely with self indulgent self confessions, it is one of those rare moments that one can stop and self reflect on one's own: life, mate, friends, marriage and a whole lot of other things.",3,Unexpected revelations,1189641600,"09 13, 2007",2007,1673,"['one', 'movies', 'one', 'not', 'find', 'many', 'reviews', 'attention', 'shelf', 'fact', 'pacted', 'well', 'known', 'Hollywood', 'names', 'watch', 'movie', 'keep', 'mind', 'following', 'plot', 'artsy', 'types', 'Hollywood', 'expect', 'performing', 'aspects', 'talent', 'are', 'something', 'human', 'beings', 'are', 'nothing', 'was', 'entire', 'conflict', 'movie', 'how', 'can', 'people', 'talented', 'be', 'so', 'shallow', 'Example', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'character', 'coming', 'Hollywood', 'actress', 'who', 'disliked', 'almost', 'woman', 'bunch', 'virtue', 'being', 'young', 'pretty', 'other', 'faults', 'men', 'drool', 'youth', 'unrestrained', 'freedom', 'sometime', 'tactlessness', 'women', 'seem', 'loath', 'How', 'childlish', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'Hollywood', 'insecurities', 'have', 'limits', 'right', 'are', 'looking', 'strong', 'character', 'presentation', 'will', 'find', 'Jennifer', 'Beals', 'character', 'unpretentious', 'sincere', 'However', 'even', 'human', 'approach', 'situations', 'people', 'face', 'turned', 'back', 'not', 'wife', 'goofball', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'performance', 'treat', 'also', 'see', 'real', 'life', 'husband', 'wife', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'Phoebe', 'Cates', 'mingle', 'bunch', 'down', 'earth', 'approachability', 'totally', 'unpretentious', 'fact', 'Kline', 'quoting', 'Shakespeare.While', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'drag', 'indefinitely', 'self', 'indulgent', 'self', 'confessions', 'one', 'rare', 'moments', 'one', 'can', 'stop', 'reflect', 'one', 'own', 'life', 'mate', 'friends', 'marriage', 'whole', 'lot', 'other', 'things']",N/A

Sure, actors, writers, directors, etc. are people, just like anyone else, but their particular perceptions and priorities necessarily shift them into a unique position within the landscape of the human condition, wherein they exist amongst their own and for the most part play the game by their own rules.  This is a generalization, of course; not every actor or artist lives in the style depicted in this film, but many do.  In the final analysis, Hollywood is not called ""La-La Land"" for no reason, and Cumming and Leigh know it.  Welcome to a world in which anything is acceptable, anything goes, and usually does.Writer/director Joe Therrian (Cumming) and actress Sally Nash (Leigh) have prepared a party to celebrate their six years together; not that they have actually been ""together"" the entire time, but according to the actor/artist math, it's close enough.  Close friends and associates have been invited to share whatever this is with them, as well as a couple of neighbors, Monica and Ryan Rose (Mina Badie, Denis O'Hare), who have certain ""issues"" with Joe and Sally.  And, much to the chagrin of the ""aging"" Sally, whose career seems to be on the wane, Joe has invited the hot young up-and-comer in town, Skye Davidson (Gwyneth Paltrow) to the party.  As the evening wears on into the early morning hours, true feelings are gradually revealed amid a game of charades (rather, a ""production"" of charades; these people are forever ""on""), as well as the sharing of a certain ""product"" given as a present to Joe and Sally by Skye.  And so, what began as a celebration, in the cold, hard light of morning just may be remembered as something entirely different.  Welcome to the wonderful world of show biz.The daughter of actor Vic Morrow, Jennifer Jason Leigh was born into the business, so to speak; Alan Cumming, on the other hand will have to come up with his own excuse.  But they have collaborated (perhaps ""conspired"" would be more accurate) to bring to the screen an interesting, thought provoking story that for all intents and purposes seems, at least, as if it could be a composite of actual experiences and people they have known.  Which means they've succeeded in delivering a film that has the decided flavor of reality about it, and for the most part it's extremely engaging, and often riveting drama.  it may be a film that many will have trouble connecting with, though, if only because it is bound to fall outside the realm of personal experience for them.  Most of the issues in this story are simply unfamiliar territory to the greater part of the world's population, with the exception of those dealing with the more universal themes, like the appreciation of a child's song, or the irritation of the perpetual barking of a neighbor's dog.What really sells the project, though, and maintains interest, is the excellent ensemble cast the filmmakers have assembled here, portraying an inordinate number of characters driven by look-at-me! egos, yet each presented within their own unique perspectives and contexts.  At the center of the fray, of course, is Cumming and Leigh, each of whom do a solid job of anchoring the myriad situations and scenarios generated through, by and around them.  Leigh successfully conveys a sense of insecurity consistent with Sally's current status, and Cumming does a good job of making Joe quite unlikable, affecting as he does the look, attitude and personality born of an overblown and bloated ego.  it's a portrayal that effectively points up the absolute boorishness that can be found within this community.Paltrow, meanwhile, perfectly captures the essence of the shallow and relatively clueless ingenue, the vast majority of whom become a flavor of the week before disappearing into the obscurity of Hollywood's human ""outbox.""  While Phoebe Cates, as former actress Sophia Gold, represents the opposite end of the spectrum, a young woman perfectly content with her current role of wife and mother.  And Kevin Kline is convincing as her husband, actor Cal Gold, who though successful is still visited with insecurities and doubt; and his performance is one of the highlights of the film.Also turning in performances that stand out from the rest are Mina Badie (Leigh's real life half-sister) as the neighbor who comes to the party offering conciliatory overtures toward a more ""neighborly"" relationship; John C. Reilly, as Mac Forsyth, a veteran director struggling with his latest project (the star of which just happens to be Sally Nash); and Peter Sellers look alike Michael Panes, as Sally's talented friend, Levi.Rounding out the exceptional cast are Jane Adams (Clair), John Benjamin Hickey (Jerry), Parker Posey (Judy), Jennifer Beals (Gina), Matt Malloy (Sanford) and Owen Kline and Greta Kline (Kevin and Phoebe's real life children, as Jack and Evie Gold).  A film that is more interesting than entertaining, ""The Anniversary Party"" nevertheless offers the viewer a chance to vicariously explore and experience Tinsel Town from the dark side of the curtain; some will find it exciting, while others will deem it decidedly unglamorous.  Either way, Cumming and Leigh are to be commended for making it ""real.""  It's the magic of the movies.",4,Welcome to the (Sort of) Celebration,1031184000,"09 5, 2002",2002,6003,"['film', 'back', 'curtain', 'reveal', 'glimpse', 'what', 'celebrity', 'when', 'cameras', 'are',

Crawford,"[1, 1]","This is a film about how some people of Hollywood lose control not just of their careers, but of their personal lives, all in one heavy, crazy party that exposes the rawness of their vulnerabilities.  It is not pretty, but it is fascinating.JJ Leigh is a star who has perhaps passed the zenith of her career and is adjusting to the roles she is being offered, of lesser quality, often in genres that may not fit her talents, for the most part because she is past her youthful prime.  By way of contrast, the rising Gwyneth Paltrow is invited - by Leigh's philandering husband, no less - to an anniversary party at their home, along with a large crew of Hollywood careerists who bring their insecurities and bravado with them.  As the evening wears on, it seems to spiral out of control, leading to mild drug overdoses, panics, indiscretions, and revelations that can shatter relationships.  In a way, it is like a drunken high school party, where things don't go your way and it doesn't help that you have gotten way too drunk.  Chaos and fear ring in the background like tinnitus.The acting in this is absolutely superlative, as you see the ""beautiful people"" reduced to making passes at neighbors' wines and unsure of what they want to do with their lives.  Truly frightening, but I suppose pregnant with possibility.

With so many fine actors involved, you keep expecting something of value to transpire - but, before you waste two precious hours of your life watching this dreck, let me assure you that it never happens.

682370,AWUUMER0F3WF4,B00005TPLW,Sheryl Fechter,"[3, 3]","This movie is one of the rare films that I have viewed over and over again through the years, and have always been able to appreciate it for something new every time.  Written and directed by Jennifer Jason Leigh and Alan Cumming who also star as the married couple, Joe and Sally.  As an avid fan of Leigh's since the early 80's, there are so many movies that I have seen her in that most often tend to veer onto the darker side.  That is Leigh and how she chooses of whom she will portray.  In ""The Anniversay Party"" I seem to see that she is taking a 'shot' at the whole glamorizing of the 'movie scene'.  Leigh and Cumming take this one a bit 'lighter' than her usual, adding many personal touches with the cast (Kevin Kline and Phoebe Cates along with their real life children as the Gold family, Leigh's own step sister is the neighbor wife and even Leigh's dog is a part of this movie).Through this over-blown, self absorbed vehicle that is the celebration of the couple's 6th wedding anniversary, so many different Hollywood types, neighbors and friends come converging to the party.  Although from the onset, their marriage is just coming back together again through many years of turbulence.  The husband Joe is an author who is just readying himself to direct his latest novel, based on his wife Sally's earier years as an actress.  Joe is blatant about choosing the next upcoming star in Hollywood to play this role (Gwyneth Paltrow who is 'Skye Davidson'), while Sally is ill at ease with his choice and furthermore he has invited her to the party.  This first pulls the string of tension that runs throughout this film to the tautest point and doesn't let up.This is a small budget picture and thankfully so.  It affords all the necessary focus to be on the characters and on their dialogue.  This all takes place within one day and one night, preparing first and receiving their guests for the party in the evening as each player comes through their door adding layer upon layer of drama, comedy and tragedy.  The different scenes of the party itself are very interesting within themselves, the 'toasting scene' probably being one of the most revealing, also the whole game of 'charades'.  It's like watching a Hollywood type implosion.  This film cannot be pigeonholed within the drama or comedy realm as it is basically both, depending on your own personal viewpoint. For myself, I could see several very funny parts in their extravagant lives of bloated ego. Several Shakespearian quotes and back biting, off handed remarks and over the top rantings flow through this, it does get hilarious at points.Midway through the film, Skye Davidson drops a bag of Ecstasy onto a table and several of the party leave at this point while many stay on.  They all have been drinking for several hours and now start to add this to the mix.It doesn't mix well.People start milling around talking and doing outrageous things, one woman running about without any clothing for basically the second half of the movie, while the neighbor seems to go into some sort of hypnotic state.  Everyone is affected differently as the film turns into a comedy of errors.  Too much is said in the old adage of ""loose lips sink ships"".  While Sally is off basically reflecting with her friend, her husband Joe is into his penchant for philandering that caused the couple problems in their past.  Many different situations happen with the cast throughout this part of the film and a lot of damage also as that tension is pulling ever tauter.You will find yourself wondering how in the world is this party going to end, but end it does.The cast itself is full of so many big names (Jane Adams, John C. Reilly, Jennifer Beals and Parker Posey to name a few more) that you really need to see the film to see how each character lends themselves to this party of mass proportions.  Leigh and Cumming did a masterful job with this film in showing the excess of Hollywood and in making it completely relatable to the everyday person.

The Anniversary Party is a beautiful movie about how miserable people can be and what lousy people people can be. About how horrible life can be and how everything we try to do to make it better only makes it worse. The film takes place in and around the home of Joe (Cumming) and Sally (Leigh) Therrian during their 6th anniversary party. They have invited 14 guests-- friends, colleagues, and their neighbors, who they hate, but invited anyway in hopes that they can come to a mutual understanding.Nearly all of these people are famous (or semi-famous) in some way-- writers, directors, actors, musicians, etc.-- or if not, they're at least married to someone who is. All of the characters appear to be of a-few-loose-screws-in-the-attic sort, except for Monica Rose (the neighbor's wife, played to perfection by Mina Badie), who is totally out of her element among the rest of the parties guests.

You wonder if the actors knew the cameras were running yet.  Alan Cummings plays the gayest husband ever.  Remember Wayland & Madame from the 1970s/80s?  Wayland and that old lady puppet would make a more convincing hetero couple than Cummings and Jennifer Jason Leigh.  Dana Carvey played a character called ""The Effeminate Heterosexual"" on SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE.  Carvey couldn't have vamped it up as much as Cummings did in this movie.The actual anniversary party itself features a clumsy and embarrassing game of charades along with dull and indulgent toasts.  There isn't a believable moment to anything.After alcohol and ecstacy are passed around, the movie finally has something that kind of happens in it.  Actors crying, yelling, still rattling on about themselves.  Cummings gets even gayer, shouting about all the women he's loved...wearing a yellow Boy London muscle shirt and bands in his hair.For a movie about Hollywood types having a party, I'd rather rewatch Blake Edwards' S.O.B. from 1981.

682374,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005TPLW,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 6]","In 1998, Alan Cumming and Jennifer Jason Leigh met on the production of Broadway musical ""Cavaret"" (Alan as MC and Jennifer as Sally) and soon they established friendship, which led to the co-directing of ""The Anniversary Party.""  (Very brief footage of the show can be seen in Jason Biggs - Mena Suvari's  ""Loser."")  And later Scotland-born actor and LA-born actress decided to make a film about their feelings on life in Hollywood; keep this fact in mind because that part makes the film, otherwise a bit dull and tedious, more lively and interesting.The film itself has little movement; it is rather a train of vignettes, or sketches, about the one day in the life of Hollywood celebrities, and the characters are often unmemorable.  But what is most lamentable is that the film seems to wallow in showing wild behaviors of Hollywood celebrities -- like drug use or nudity in the swimming pool -- but we know these thing well, probably as well as Cumming or Leigh.  It is the time of the Internet and media, and the tabloids are always there to supply the gossips about Hollywood.  And this crazy  practice has been kept since the time of silent films, so why should we see another example here unless it is connected with deeper meaning about life in general, which we can relate to?However, the film offers another way of enjoying it, and that's this.  For example, Leigh plays Sally, an actress whose career is, she knows, going downward, and she just experienced a short period of separation with her hubby Joe (Cumming).  Now Joe is going to direct a movie, but he doesn't choose his wife as the lead; instead, he cast a newcomer Davidson (Gwyneth Paltrow), good-natured but slightly irritating, unconscious of the pain Sally is suffering.  This rejection, probably based on her age, naturally makes Sally unhappy. ---- Now, Leigh herself was in a popular teen comedy ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" which includes upcoming talent like Sean Penn and then young unknown Nicholas Cage, and compared with these males, to whom the offers of job steadily are likely to come after getting middle-aged, it is certain that female players are likely to be in disadvantageous position after graduating 'young and fresh' school.  I can understand Sally's (or perhaps Leigh's) discontent feelings, which, I believe, are the true voices of the actresses like Jennifer Jason Leigh herself.And another joy comes from unexpected place, from a co-starring actress with Leigh in ""Fast Times"" ---- Phoebe Cates.  She plays virtually herself, an ex-actress who married Kevin Kilne's character (and real Phoebe Cates is married to Kevin for a long  time, you know), and the two kids are the real children between them.  So, you can see a glimpse of their life here, and may be surprised to find that Ms Cates, long retired from screen, are no longer what she was.  That's a good thing here; she is happy as a wife and mother, and the kids are lovely, and she, intentionally or not, shows an alternative way of life for actress.  (Check out one of her lines, which is very suggestive of her true feelings about the job.)  Well, anyway, good to see her again, and in a happy mood, too.I don't keep on writing these things about ""fact or fiction"" trivia, but you may sense what I mean.  The film is, again I tell you, a weak, overlong one with too self-indulgent tones.  The characters are often unlikable (especailly Jane Adams's one), and if not so, very unimpressive.  You see J. C. Reilly and Parker Posey, but you don't remember them.  You get Jennifer Beals, who is fine as ever as a cool and intelligent photographer (like herself), but too short time is allotted to her.  Though the film's photography is beautiful, the fact cannot be hidden that it is shot with a digital camera.  At the time of writing, the film has never been released in UK, which is not a surprising thing to us.Still, ""Anniversary Party"" has its moments, and they are when the actors, usually very competent ones, do not act.  It is a great irony, but the kids of Kevin Kline and Phoebe Cates shine most in the film.  And they are really cute, but at the same time it is true that they are acting least.",3,Phoebe Cates and her (& Kevin Kline') Kids Steal Every Scene,1027036800,"07 19, 2002",2002,4167,"['1998', 'Alan', 'Cumming', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'met', 'production', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'Cavaret', 'Alan', 'MC', 'Jennifer', 'Sally', 'soon', 'established', 'friendship', 'led', 'co-directing', 'Anniversary', 'Party', 'Very', 'brief', 'footage', 'show', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'Jason', 'Biggs', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'Loser', 'later', 'Scotland-born', 'actor', 'LA-born', 'actress', 'decided', 'make', 'film', 'feelings', 'life', 'Hollywood', 'keep', 'fact', 'mind', 'part', 'film', 'otherwise', 'bit', 'dull', 'tedious', 'more', 'lively', 'interesting.The', 'film', 'little', 'movement', 'rather', 'train', 'vignettes', 'sketches', 'one', 'day', 'life', 'Hollywood', 'celebrities', 'characters', 'are', 'often', 'unmemorable', 'what', 'most', 'lamentable', 'film', 'wallow', 'showing', 'wild', 'behaviors', 'Hollywood', 'celebrities', 'drug', 'use', 'nudity', 'swimming', 'pool', 'know', 'thing', 'well', 'probably', 'as', 'well', 'Cumming', 'Leigh', 'time', 'Internet', 'media', 'tabloids', 'are', 'always', 'there', 'supply', 'gossips', 'Hollywood', 'crazy', 'practice', 'been', 'kept', 'time', 'silent', 'films', 'so', 'why', 'should', 'see', 'example', 'here', 'connected', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'life', 'general', 'can', 'relate', 'However', 'film', 'way', 'enjoying', 'example', 'Leigh', 'Sally', 'actress', 'career', 'going', 'downward', 'just', 'experienced', 'short', 'period', 'separation', 'hubby', 'Joe', 'Cumming', 'Now', 'Joe', 'going', 'direct', 'movie', ""n't"", 'choose', 'wife', 'lead', 'instead', 'cast', 'newcomer', 'Davidson', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'good-natured', 'slightly', 'irritating', 'unconscious', 'pain', 'Sally', 'suffering', 'rejection', 'probably', 'based', 'age', 'naturally', 'Sally', 'unhappy', 'Now', 'Leigh', 'was', 'popular', 'teen', 'comedy', 'Fast', 'Times', 'Ridgemont', 'High', 'upcoming', 'talent', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'then', 'young', 'unknown', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'compared', 'males', 'whom', 'offers', 'job', 'steadily', 'are', 'likely', 'come', 'getting', 'middle-aged', 'certain', 'female', 'players', 'are', 'likely', 'be', 'disadvantageous', 'position', 'graduating', ""'young"", 'fresh', 'school', 'can', 'understand', 'Sally', 'perhaps', 'Leigh', 'discontent', 'feelings', 'believe', 'are', 'true', 'voices', 'actresses', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'herself.And', 'joy', 'unexpected', 'place', 'co-starring', 'actress', 'Leigh', 'Fast', 'Times', 'Phoebe', 'Cates', 'virtually', 'ex-actress', 'who', 'married', 'Kevin', 'Kilne', 'character', 'real', 'Phoebe', 'Cates', 'married', 'Kevin', 'long', 'time', 'know', 'two', 'kids', 'are', 'real', 'children', 'So', 'can', 'see', 'glimpse', 'life', 'here', 'may', 'be', 'surprised', 'find', 'Ms', 'Cates', 'long', 'retired', 'screen', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'what', 'was', 'good', 'thing', 'here', 'happy', 'wife', 'mother', 'kids', 'are', 'lovely', 'intentionally', 'not', 'alternative', 'way', 'life', 'actress', 'Check', 'out', 'one', 'lines', 'very', 'suggestive', 'true', 'feelings', 'job', 'Well', 'anyway', 'good', 'see', 'again', 'happy', 'mood', 'too.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'keep', 'writing', 'things', 'fact', 'fiction', 'trivia', 'may', 'sense', 'what', 'mean', 'film', 'again', 'tell', 'weak', 'overlong', 'one', 'too', 'self-indulgent', 'tones', 'characters', 'are', 'often', 'unlikable', 'especailly', 'Jane', 'Adams', 'one', 'not', 'so', 'very', 'unimpressive', 'see', 'J.', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'get', 'Jennifer', 'Beals', 'who', 'fine', 'as', 'ever', 'cool', 'intelligent', 'photographer', 'too', 'short', 'time', 'allotted', 'film', 'photography', 'beautiful', 'fact', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'hidden', 'shot', 'digital', 'camera', 'time', 'writing', 'film', 'never', 'been', 'released', 'UK', 'not', 'surprising', 'thing', 'us.Still', 'Anniversary', 'Party', 'moments', 'are', 'when', 'actors', 'usually', 'very', 'competent', 'ones', 'do', 'not', 'act', 'great', 'irony', 'kids', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'Phoebe', 'Cates', 'shine', 'most', 'film', 'are', 'really', 'cute', 'same', 'time', 'true', 'are', 'acting', 'least']",N/A
