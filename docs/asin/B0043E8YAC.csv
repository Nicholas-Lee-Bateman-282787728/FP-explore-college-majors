1384294,A3VUXYHJGL9WWX,B0043E8YAC,"bass boy ""music fan""","[52, 57]","This is an impressive performance by Heaven and Hell (read Black Sabbath Mark 2 1/2 - Tony Iommi, Ronnie James Dio (RIP), Geezer Butler and Vinny Appice. Although the set seems a little on the short side - they play just shy of 90 minutes as headliners for an outdoor festival in Germany. The sound is really good, although I wish there were a few more shots of Geezer on bass. He's seen fairly frequently, but Dio and Iommi occupy the most screen time. One of the things I liked about this DVD, which some might not, is the fact that the audience is almost inaudible throughout much of the show - we get, instead, the crunch of Iommi's Gibson, the pulsating greatness from Butler's Yamaha bass, the thump from Appice's drums and Dio's voice, loud and proud and out front. The band is inspired and, possibly, unaware that it would be Dio's final filmed performance.The bonus interviews are interesting, but I wish they lasted longer. When Geezer mentions that he liked recording ""The Sign of the Southern Cross"" for 1981's ""Mob Rules"" long player, he talks about how he loved experimenting with different bass pedals and effects. Instead of asking Geezer to explain more about the effects, like which ones were used, interviewer Eddie Trunk moves on to his next question. Eddie is a good guy and knowledgable, although (in the footage seen) he avoids asking anything about their musical equipment - something musicians surely would want to ask/know. Lol. :)They mention recording ""Mob Rules"" for the ""Heavy Metal"" film and soundtrack, and I so wished Trunk asked them if it definitely was Appice on drums on that early version. The drums on the movie soundtrack version sound more like the style of Bill Ward (very fluid, hard yet slightly jazzy) than that of Appice's performance on the re-recorded song for the ""Mob Rules"" LP  (Appice seemingly made it a habit of pausing for a second or half-second after doing a drum fill across his toms, before coming back into the straight rhythm of the song - the drum fills on the movie version are without any breaks).Fans might be shocked when they learn which Black Sabbath contemporary  Vinny Appice turned down for a drumming job back in 1980 ....It's a good release. I really wish I had a DVD of the 2007 show I saw, but this release (and the Radio City Music Hall DVD) are terrific reminders of that show, and how the great talent that was Dio will be missed.",4,4 1/2 stars for the final video of Black Sabbath Mark 2 1/2,1288828800,"11 4, 2010",2010,2408,"['impressive', 'performance', 'Heaven', 'Hell', 'read', 'Black', 'Sabbath', 'Mark', '2', '1/2', 'Tony', 'Iommi', 'Ronnie', 'James', 'Dio', 'RIP', 'Geezer', 'Butler', 'Vinny', 'Appice', 'set', 'little', 'short', 'side', 'play', 'just', 'shy', '90', 'minutes', 'headliners', 'outdoor', 'festival', 'Germany', 'sound', 'really', 'good', 'wish', 'were', 'few', 'more', 'shots', 'Geezer', 'bass', 'seen', 'fairly', 'frequently', 'Dio', 'Iommi', 'occupy', 'most', 'screen', 'time', 'One', 'things', 'liked', 'DVD', 'might', 'not', 'fact', 'audience', 'almost', 'inaudible', 'much', 'show', 'get', 'instead', 'crunch', 'Iommi', 'Gibson', 'pulsating', 'greatness', 'Butler', 'Yamaha', 'bass', 'thump', 'Appice', 'drums', 'Dio', 'voice', 'loud', 'proud', 'out', 'front', 'band', 'inspired', 'possibly', 'unaware', 'would', 'be', 'Dio', 'final', 'filmed', 'performance.The', 'bonus', 'interviews', 'are', 'interesting', 'wish', 'lasted', 'longer', 'When', 'Geezer', 'mentions', 'liked', 'recording', 'Sign', 'Southern', 'Cross', '1981', 'Mob', 'Rules', 'long', 'player', 'how', 'loved', 'experimenting', 'different', 'bass', 'pedals', 'effects', 'Instead', 'asking', 'Geezer', 'explain', 'more', 'effects', 'ones', 'were', 'used', 'interviewer', 'Eddie', 'Trunk', 'next', 'question', 'Eddie', 'good', 'guy', 'knowledgable', 'footage', 'seen', 'asking', 'anything', 'musical', 'equipment', 'something', 'musicians', 'surely', 'would', 'want', 'ask/know', 'Lol', 'mention', 'recording', 'Mob', 'Rules', 'Heavy', 'Metal', 'film', 'soundtrack', 'so', 'wished', 'Trunk', 'asked', 'definitely', 'was', 'Appice', 'drums', 'early', 'version', 'drums', 'movie', 'soundtrack', 'version', 'sound', 'more', 'style', 'Bill', 'Ward', 'very', 'fluid', 'hard', 'yet', 'slightly', 'jazzy', 'Appice', 'performance', 're-recorded', 'song', 'Mob', 'Rules', 'LP', 'Appice', 'seemingly', 'made', 'habit', 'pausing', 'second', 'half-second', 'doing', 'drum', 'fill', 'toms', 'coming', 'back', 'straight', 'rhythm', 'song', 'drum', 'movie', 'version', 'are', 'breaks', '.Fans', 'might', 'be', 'shocked', 'when', 'learn', 'Black', 'Sabbath', 'contemporary', 'Vinny', 'Appice', 'turned', 'down', 'drumming', 'job', 'back', '1980', 'good', 'release', 'really', 'wish', 'had', 'DVD', '2007', 'show', 'saw', 'release', 'Radio', 'City', 'Music', 'Hall', 'DVD', 'are', 'terrific', 'reminders', 'show', 'how', 'great', 'talent', 'was', 'Dio', 'will', 'be', 'missed']",Neon Nights: 30 Years of Heaven & Hell- Live in Europe

1384297,A1DDPWLITL7THF,B0043E8YAC,Customer from Quebec,"[1, 2]","Black Sabbath never new that firing Ozzy will give them a second life and  the Dio lineup will become a true legend on its own. ""Heaven and Hell"" is still on the list of the best rock albums ever and Dio is the only singer to have three albums on that list along with DIO's ""Holy Diver"" and  Rainbow's ""Rising"".I thought that  Live From Radio City Music Hall 2007 was the best Black Sabbath DVD, but their last one seems to be even better. Not that they perform better, but they seem on fire and it shows that they are really enjoying performing together  having the time of their lives. I have never seen them like this. Dio's voice is unbelievable as always and I had the feeling that he'll be around forever. But, as Geezer says on the interview, it was too good to be true.. I was fourteen when I became a fan after Rainbow's debut album and now I cannot believe that Dio's gone.This DVD is a historic monument of a legendary performance from one of the greatest bands with one of the greatest  singers.

The show was great!! I thought seeing Ozzy reunite with Black Sabbath in concert was great, and never dreamed I'd see Dio perform with them!This dvd was filmed very well and the sound is great!  Love Geezer Butler's bass, Tony is always a near-perfect guitar player, Vinnie's drum set is the coolest I've ever seen and I just love Dio's stage presence and singing style--Dio even wears the coolest shirt I've seen a rock star wear in years!.I just don't get why on this show and the Holy Diver Live dvd, the songs are performed a step down and Dio sings them deeper.  However, on the newer H&H; songs, Dio sings them with vengence and in a higher key.  That's why the dvd gets 4 stars.  If you wanna see DIO at his peak and hear the songs sang with pure additude and higher pitch, pick up the Sacred Heart live DVD.All in all this is a great performance.  These guys are like in their 50's/60's and still totally blow away many of the younger bands out there.  Geezer, Tony, Vinnie and the late DIO are top notch musicians.

1384309,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B0043E8YAC,trebe,"[2, 2]","Sadly, Ronnie James Dio, one of the greatest, most distinctive singers in heavy metal, is no longer with us, having lost his battle with cancer, at the age of 67.  An articulate and intelligent man, Ronnie is remembered for his substantial musical legacy, his humbleness, and for the generosity and appreciation shown to his many fans throughout the years.Fortunately, one of Ronnie's last live performances with Heaven and Hell, was captured on Neon Nights: Thirty Years of Heaven and Hell (2010).  Recorded on July 30, 2009 in Wacken, Germany, the DVD does a great job of capturing the band, on what is a very good night.  The camera work is solid, with a good selection of angles of the outdoor stage.  The editing that is somewhat leisurely, without an excessive number of radical cuts.Each dressed in black, Dio, guitarist Tony Iommi, bassist Geezer Butler, and drummer Vinny Appice, are very loose and in exceptionally fine form.  A very slim looking Dio, appears quite spry and energetic.  His voice is as distinctive and powerful as ever, as Ronnie goes for the tough notes, only occasionally saving his voice.  Always the consummate frontman, Ronnie seems completely into the performance, and appears quite animated and emotional throughout the night, even swearing a few times.  Inspiring and magical, except for the profanity, it's precisely what you expect from Ronnie James Dio.Tony Iommi, the metal riffmaster, is rock solid, seamlessly transitioning from rhythm to lead guitar.  His solos are extremely tight, usually very close to what he recorded on the album versions.  There not much flash to Iommi, he's almost 100% substance.  A godfather of metal guitar, Tony seems to have tapped into the fountain of youth, looking fantastic at 61.  Onstage, Geezer Butler rarely moves, as his playing solidly anchors the band.  When Tony is soloing, Geezer always plays something that perfectly fills the void.  Vinny Appice, Ronnie's long time bandmate, is equally solid on the drums.  Somewhere out of sight, is Scott Warren on keyboards.The setlist predominantly draws from the classic Sabbath albums Heaven and Hell (1980), Mob Rules (1981), and Dehumanizer (1992).  From Heaven and Hell's album The Devil You Know (2009), the band performs Fear, Follow the Tears, and Bible Black.  The new music reveals that these men have mellowed very little with age.  Time Machine from Dehumanizer is a new addition to the traditional setlist.  The song Heaven and Hell, is usually an  improvisational number, and the 17 minute extended version preformed here is one of the high points, complete with spouting flames.  It's a killer show, and Ronnie and Tony in particular, are just outstanding.The DVD also includes individual interviews with the band members, reflecting back on the thirty years since Ronnie James Dio first joined Black Sabbath.  What is said is of particular interest, given Dio's untimely death.  As always, Ronnie displays nothing but class, taking the high road.  Also included are brief interviews with the remaining members, recorded after Ronnie's passing.The band had previously released another concert DVD,Heaven & Hell: Live from Radio City Music Hall(2007).  Also highly recommended, this DVD captures another great performance (114 minutes), at another renowned venue.  It includes songs from Sabbath's Dio Years reunion album, and classics like Voodoo, Lonely Is The Word, The Sign of the Southern Cross, Computer God, and Lady Evil, all of which are not performed during the Wacken concert.Ronnie James Dio's on and off relationship with Black Sabbath spanned three decades, and was both magical and tumultuous.  After departing from Rainbow, Dio joined Black Sabbath in 1979, replacing the legendary Ozzy Osbourne.  Together with Iommi, Butler, and drummer Bill Ward, the new Black Sabbath producedHeaven & Hell, a bona fide milestone in heavy metal.  This was followed byMob Rules, andLive Evil(1982), featuring Vinny Appice on drums.In the early 80's both Dio and Appice ended up out of Sabbath, and Ronnie formed his own band Dio, with Vinny on drums much of the time.  After nearly a decade as a successful solo artist, Dio and Appice rejoined Black Sabbath, recording the severely underrated albumDehumanizer.  After which, for the second time, Dio and Appice left Sabbath and reformed the Dio band.Reuniting again, under the name Heaven And Hell, Iommi, Dio, Butler, and Appice recorded The Devil You Know.  The future looked promising for all concerned, when Dio tragically passed away.  To the one born Ronald James Padavona, who became world famous as Ronnie James Dio, and meant so much, to so many, may he truly rest in peace.",5,"the world is full of Kings and Queens, that blind

1384310,A2A0FBLKJN4ZY5,B0043E8YAC,W. freeman,"[5, 6]","It was a huge blow for me and the metal community when Ronnie was diagnosed with cancer, i had no idea until close to the end. I have been a Dio fan off and since i was about 10 or so, some albums i loved and some were mediocre. One thing that was never bad though was Ronnies voice, the man sung like hell until the day he died! Some of the music was not of the best quality from a song writing perspective, mainly because of the subject matter, but who cares, i think he was timeless. This DVD while good, isn't great. It pains me to see Ronnie and know that he knew he had cancer at this time and he struggles on some songs to really sing very well. Other songs he shines on. The band sounds old but Ronnie really doesnt, and the quality of the DVD isn't great either. Also i don't really see a reason for this release other than the 2 new tracks when you already have the first Heaven and Hell DVD which was far better and had more songs on it. This is just a rehash with a few extras. So i will never dog Ronnie because he is the Man On The Silver Mountain. But to me this was just like seeing the other show from 2007 or so.If your a huge fan and want to pay for a few extra songs that werent released prior, by all means buy it. But to me i'm satisfied with the first release. Also i feel the performance on it was much stronger. I think in memory of Dio they should just have released a DVD of all kinds of his live material throughout the years. Perhaps they did but i just haven't seen it yet. I know there is a CD, but i want good footage of the man, the legend DIO.!",3,R.I.P Dio you were the best.,1292371200,"12 15, 2010",2010,1578,"['was', 'huge', 'blow', 'metal', 'community', 'when', 'Ronnie', 'was', 'diagnosed', 'cancer', 'i', 'had', 'idea', 'close', 'end', 'have', 'been', 'Dio', 'fan', 'i', 'was', 'about', '10', 'so', 'albums', 'i', 'loved', 'were', 'mediocre', 'One', 'thing', 'was', 'never', 'bad', 'was', 'Ronnies', 'voice', 'man', 'sung', 'hell', 'day', 'died', 'music', 'was', 'not', 'best', 'quality', 'song', 'writing', 'perspective', 'mainly', 'subject', 'matter', 'who', 'i', 'think', 'was', 'timeless', 'DVD', 'good', ""n't"", 'great', 'see', 'Ronnie', 'know', 'knew', 'had', 'cancer', 'time', 'songs', 'really', 'sing', 'very', 'well', 'Other', 'songs', 'band', 'old', 'Ronnie', 'really', 'quality', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'great', 'either', 'Also', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'reason', 'release', 'other', '2', 'new', 'tracks', 'when', 'already', 'have', 'first', 'Heaven', 'Hell', 'DVD', 'was', 'far', 'better', 'had', 'more', 'songs', 'just', 'rehash', 'few', 'extras', 'i', 'will', 'never', 'dog', 'Ronnie', 'Man', 'Silver', 'Mountain', 'was', 'just', 'seeing', 'other', 'show', '2007', 'so.If', 'huge', 'fan', 'want', 'pay', 'few', 'extra', 'songs', 'werent', 'released', 'prior', 'means', 'buy', 'i', ""'m"", 'satisfied', 'first', 'release', 'Also', 'i', 'feel', 'performance', 'was', 'much', 'stronger', 'think', 'memory', 'Dio', 'should', 'just', 'have', 'released', 'DVD', 'kinds', 'live', 'material', 'years', 'Perhaps', 'did', 'i', 'just', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'know', 'CD', 'i', 'want', 'good', 'footage', 'man', 'legend', 'DIO']",Neon Nights: 30 Years of Heaven & Hell- Live in Europe
