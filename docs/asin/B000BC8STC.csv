940006,AY12DBB0U420B,B000BC8STC,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","I picked up ""James Brown: Live at Montreux"" from the bargain DVD rack at a nearby Ross Store. I remembered him from way back. To be honest, I never particularly cared for James Brown but I'd seen him on TV performances and he always put on an interesting show. As such, I picked up the DVD.I have mixed feelings about this DVD. I'd say it's somewhat marginal in quality. I've seen worse live concerts, I might add. I'd almost say this performance comes in two parts. The first half is quite good. Brown is really on and puts everything he has into about a half-dozen songs. The man is amazing. His sense of rhythm and timing is exquisite and the camera work really picks it up. Brown and his band (5 piece horn section, guitar, bass, drums and 3 singers/dancers) really do their stuff and it's fun watching. Brown is sweating profusely and I began to wonder how much weight he loses in a concert. Does he take a time-out to re-hydrate?In any case, the second half of the concert seems to peter out, or maybe it's my interest that wanes. There's a long section that honors dead entertainers, for example. Then there's a bunch of partial songs plus a lot of audience participation. Well, I don't go to a concert or watch one for the audience participation. Then there's the Brown ego thing. The words ""James Brown"" were uttered at least 100 times. No, make that 150. It just get to be too much and it cuts down on the music that I want to hear. The concert seemed to get longer and longer and of less interest as it progressed. Based on the first half, I'd rate the DVD as 4 stars, but the second half would be no better than a three. Add them together into a 3 1/2. OK, I was entertained, so I'll raise it to 4 stars.Gary Peterson",4,Interesting First Half.

And he did it repeatedly - every time James Brown would start to dance, the camera was looking at something else.Maybe the cameraman was jealous.Anyway, nobody puts on a more frenetic show than this.Great, and great!

940012,A39GW5CBWTIWAZ,B000BC8STC,Phil S.,"[9, 9]","Here is the best James Brown concert available, not for the repertoire, which has no songs (save for two non-listed interjections) not found on the many other DVD/VHS JB offers, and in fact does not contain ""bonus tracks"" *or* the listed ""Hustle (Dead On It)""  - the 1975 Disco-Soul semi-hit I'm sure was a major selling point for buyers. If it's here then it's possibly in the form of a very familiar sequeway - maybe a few notes from the tune validate its' listing.What makes this item standout is the fine technical direction, lighting, sound, and more significantly, the chance to watch a great artist, obviously up for the occasion and in great voice. On ""Please, Please, Please"" he jumps into the audience (noticeably short on lady fans for some reason) and gets down deep on the classic that put him on the road.There is some consolation for fans here in that ""It's A Man's...World"" incorporates ""Lost Someone"" and ""Fever"" - the only segment which collectors can really enthuse over.This is an excellent companion to the '79 Comeback show (""The Lost James Brown Tapes"" aka ""Bodyheat"") and the '83 show with B.

King at the Beverly Theatre in L.A., which are better musically but do not have the production values of this '81 event.",4,Strong *4* despite absence of listed tunes,1146182400,"04 28, 2006",2006,1240,"['Here', 'best', 'James', 'Brown', 'concert', 'available', 'not', 'repertoire', 'songs', 'save', 'two', 'non-listed', 'interjections', 'not', 'found', 'many', 'other', 'DVD/VHS', 'JB', 'offers', 'fact', 'not', 'contain', 'bonus', 'tracks', '*or*', 'listed', 'Hustle', 'Dead', '1975', 'Disco-Soul', 'semi-hit', ""'m"", 'sure', 'was', 'major', 'selling', 'point', 'buyers', 'here', 'then', 'possibly', 'form', 'very', 'familiar', 'sequeway', 'maybe', 'few', 'notes', 'tune', 'validate', 'listing.What', 'item', 'standout', 'fine', 'technical', 'direction', 'lighting', 'sound', 'more', 'significantly', 'chance', 'watch', 'great', 'artist', 'obviously', 'occasion', 'great', 'voice', 'Please', 'Please', 'Please', 'audience', 'noticeably', 'short', 'lady', 'fans', 'reason', 'down', 'deep', 'classic', 'put', 'road.There', 'consolation', 'fans', 'here', 'Man', 'World', 'Lost', 'Someone', 'Fever', 'only', 'segment', 'collectors', 'can', 'really', 'enthuse', 'over.This', 'excellent', 'companion', ""'79"", 'Comeback', 'show', 'Lost', 'James', 'Brown', 'Tapes', 'aka', 'Bodyheat', ""'83"", 'show', 'B', 'B', 'King', 'Beverly', 'Theatre', 'L.A.', 'are', 'better', 'musically', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'production', 'values', ""'81"", 'event']",N/A
