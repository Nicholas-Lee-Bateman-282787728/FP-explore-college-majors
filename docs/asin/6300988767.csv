241397,APDMVBRLIBCZV,6300988767,"Add 'em Up At The Movies ""Adam""","[1, 1]","Fatal Attraction: The film 4 stars / Fatal Attraction dvd with original ending included: 5 starsAn adulterer's worst fear (if they cared enough to have a fear before they commit it) comes true for Michael Douglas' Dan when his loving wife (Anne Archer) and daughter are out of town for a week, and he finds company in Alex (Glenn Close), a co-worker. Alex refuses to take no for an answer when she wants Dan to leave his wife for her. What begins as just a casual affair to Dan turns into a nightmare of threats, stalking, and an infamous boiled rabbit. The performances are very strong and believable. Michael Douglas' character has committed adultery, but you feel sympathy for him when he has to face the dangerous consequences. Glenn Close portrays Alex, a deeply disturbed woman, so well that she could scare any man from committing adultery, but at the same time, you feel sympathy for her too (though the screenplay makes it very hard to at times). Anne Archer is great as Dan's wife, while hurt by her husband remains strong. Director Adrian Lyne sets the suspense and fear just right, and the ORIGINAL screenplay by James Dearden is intriguing, tense, and believable.The only problem that I have with ""Fatal Attraction"" is the re-written, cliche, slasher ending. When the film was tested, audiences did not like the original ending and wanted a different one. So, bowing to the masses, James Dearden re-wrote the original ending, and Adrian Lyne re-shot the ending to what it is now. Thankfully, the special edition dvd includes the original ending, however I would have preferred if the studio gave the viewer two different versions of the film, one complete with the original ending and the other complete with the alternate ending. If not for the re-shot predictable ending, I would have included ""Fatal Attaction"" on my Top 10 films list of 1987. Aside from the ending, the film is still remarkable, and a must-see.",4,An excellent film with one fatal flaw,1137196800,"01 14, 2006",2006,1928,"['Fatal', 'Attraction', 'film', '4', 'stars', '/', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'dvd', 'original', 'ending', 'included', '5', 'starsAn', 'adulterer', 'worst', 'fear', 'cared', 'enough', 'have', 'fear', 'commit', 'true', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Dan', 'when', 'loving', 'wife', 'Anne', 'Archer', 'daughter', 'are', 'town', 'week', 'company', 'Alex', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'co-worker', 'Alex', 'take', 'answer', 'when', 'Dan', 'leave', 'wife', 'What', 'as', 'just', 'casual', 'affair', 'Dan', 'nightmare', 'threats', 'stalking', 'infamous', 'boiled', 'rabbit', 'performances', 'are', 'very', 'strong', 'believable', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'character', 'committed', 'adultery', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'when', 'face', 'dangerous', 'consequences', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'portrays', 'Alex', 'deeply', 'disturbed', 'woman', 'so', 'well', 'could', 'scare', 'man', 'committing', 'adultery', 'same', 'time', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'too', 'screenplay', 'very', 'hard', 'times', 'Anne', 'Archer', 'great', 'Dan', 'wife', 'hurt', 'husband', 'strong', 'Director', 'Adrian', 'Lyne', 'suspense', 'fear', 'just', 'right', 'ORIGINAL', 'screenplay', 'James', 'Dearden', 'intriguing', 'tense', 'only', 'problem', 'have', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 're-written', 'cliche', 'slasher', 'ending', 'When', 'film', 'was', 'tested', 'audiences', 'did', 'not', 'original', 'ending', 'wanted', 'different', 'one', 'So', 'bowing', 'masses', 'James', 'Dearden', 're-wrote', 'original', 'ending', 'Adrian', 'Lyne', 're-shot', 'ending', 'what', 'now', 'Thankfully', 'special', 'edition', 'dvd', 'original', 'ending', 'however', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'studio', 'gave', 'viewer', 'two', 'different', 'versions', 'film', 'one', 'complete', 'original', 'ending', 'other', 'complete', 'alternate', 'ending', 'not', 're-shot', 'predictable', 'ending', 'would', 'have', 'included', 'Fatal', 'Attaction', 'Top', '10', 'films', 'list', '1987', 'Aside', 'ending', 'film', 'still', 'remarkable', 'must-see']",N/A
241398,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,6300988767,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[5, 6]","For 1987, this was a decent little thriller that definitely showcased the amazing talent of Glenn Close.  If you were hesitant to see this film, I would suggest it to you for the sheer enjoyment of seeing Close out of her element and being as sultry as ever.  Douglas plays the classic, not to creative, father/husband/lover that must battle a barrage of threats coming from a woman that deserves every bit of respect from him.  The script is jagged, at times nearly laughable, but still an enjoyable two hours of some amazingly tense scenes handled well by Adrian Lyne, who continues to ""wow"" us with his beautiful vision and racy talent behind the camera with film favorites like Unfaithful and Jacob's Ladder (two completely different films that highlight his true talent).  I also think that the premise to this story is something to tote about as well.  It is one of those rare occurrences when you could see the honesty of the story.  It is an everyday occurrence, husbands cheating on their wives, and the reality that one could just ""snap"" after a night of sheer pleasure connects with such a mass viewing audience.  Fatal Attraction is one of those films that creates the tension from the reality of the crime or passion, which is scarier than any horror film out there.The greatest pull for this film has to be Glenn Close.  I have seen several of her films and I must admit that this one sent shivers up my spine.  She was superb as the strong-willed woman who knew what she wanted, went for it, then sought her revenge when the man wasn't able to reciprocate the feelings back to her.  She really gave some depth to this film, transforming what could have been this simple psychotic character into one with many layers and depth.  There are times that you somewhat feel sorry for her character because of the way that Douglas' character has treated her.  While some will say that she forced him into it, Douglas knew what he was doing from the beginning, and should have been ready for any of the consequences.  I will also say that I think Close's portrayal of Alex is a very feminist one.  She could have easily decided to portray her as this weak and disturbed woman, but instead I really saw her as this independent woman who wasn't going to be walked away from after a weekend of love.  Her heart was not going to be cut out and handed to her just because she was just as aggressive as most men.  I was very impressed with Close in this film.  All the while I thought Douglas was not coming out of his box.  He brought nothing spectacular to his role and in fact I found myself laughing whenever he was to portray being flustered.  It just didn't fit him.  The same goes for Archer who played a cookie-cutter wife with no emotion.  I feel that she was probably the worst character of the film.  Apparently the writers gave her no information on her character and the only direction that Lyne gave her was to ""act pretty"".  What a waste of talent.  Finally, what was up with the boy-ish looking daughter they had?  To me, that was one of the more frightening elements of this film.Outside of the characters, Lyne does a fantastic job of building suspense and tension between Douglas and Close.  He consistent and powerful use of the phone to add that extra ""violin shrill"" was a blast.  I jumped a little bit each time the phone rang in the film, which showed the power that Lyne had with this household devise.  He also structured the story well, giving us just the right amount of space and time with each of our players.  He didn't focus heavy on just Douglas, but jumped us back and forth with Close as well allowing us to see different perspectives and development.  My only struggle with the structure of the film was the ""why"" for Douglas.  Was it pure spontaneity to sleep with Close, or was there some tensions or troubles at home?  I would have liked to understand a bit clearer as to why Douglas decided to destroy his seemingly perfect family.Overall, I was impressed with this film.  While I do not think that it was exceptionally good, I do credit it for keeping my attention during the two hours that it ran.  I literally could not keep my eyes off Close.  She was amazing in this film, and if you see it for no other reason than her performance, you will not be disappointed.  It was a classic ""every man"" story that included that Lyne atmosphere of tension and erotica.  The script could have used some tweaking, but the intensity was there.  I couldn't answer my phone for a week after I watched this.  Fatal Attraction was not a bad little thriller for the feminist in all of us.Grade: *** out of *****",3,"You play fair with me, I'll play fair with you.",1105660800,"01 14, 2005",2005,4637,"['1987', 'was', 'decent', 'little', 'thriller', 'definitely', 'showcased', 'amazing', 'talent', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'were', 'hesitant', 'see', 'film', 'would', 'suggest', 'sheer', 'enjoyment', 'seeing', 'Close', 'element', 'being', 'as', 'sultry', 'ever', 'Douglas', 'classic', 'not', 'creative', 'father/husband/lover', 'must', 'battle', 'barrage', 'threats', 'coming', 'woman', 'bit', 'respect', 'script', 'jagged', 'times', 'nearly', 'laughable', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'two', 'hours', 'amazingly', 'tense', 'scenes', 'handled', 'well', 'Adrian', 'Lyne', 'who', 'wow', 'beautiful', 'vision', 'racy', 'talent', 'camera', 'film', 'favorites', 'Unfaithful', 'Jacob', 'Ladder', 'two', 'completely', 'different', 'films', 'highlight', 'true', 'talent', 'also', 'think', 'premise', 'story', 'something', 'tote', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'rare', 'occurrences', 'when', 'could', 'see', 'honesty', 'story', 'everyday', 'occurrence', 'cheating', 'wives', 'reality', 'one', 'could', 'just', 'snap', 'night', 'sheer', 'pleasure', 'mass', 'viewing', 'audience', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'one', 'films', 'tension', 'reality', 'crime', 'passion', 'scarier', 'horror', 'film', 'there.The', 'greatest', 'pull', 'film', 'be', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'have', 'seen', 'several', 'films', 'must', 'admit', 'one', 'sent', 'up', 'spine', 'was', 'superb', 'strong-willed', 'woman', 'who', 'knew', 'what', 'wanted', 'went', 'then', 'sought', 'revenge', 'when', 'man', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'reciprocate', 'feelings', 'back', 'really', 'gave', 'depth', 'film', 'transforming', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'simple', 'psychotic', 'character', 'one', 'many', 'layers', 'depth', 'are', 'times', 'somewhat', 'feel', 'sorry', 'character', 'way', 'Douglas', 'character', 'treated', 'will', 'say', 'forced', 'Douglas', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'beginning', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'ready', 'consequences', 'will', 'also', 'say', 'think', 'Close', 'portrayal', 'Alex', 'very', 'feminist', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'decided', 'portray', 'weak', 'disturbed', 'woman', 'instead', 'really', 'saw', 'independent', 'woman', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'walked', 'away', 'weekend', 'love', 'heart', 'was', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'cut', 'out', 'handed', 'just', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'aggressive', 'most', 'men', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'Close', 'film', 'while', 'thought', 'Douglas', 'was', 'not', 'coming', 'box', 'brought', 'nothing', 'spectacular', 'role', 'fact', 'found', 'laughing', 'whenever', 'was', 'portray', 'being', 'flustered', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'same', 'Archer', 'who', 'played', 'cookie-cutter', 'wife', 'emotion', 'feel', 'was', 'probably', 'worst', 'character', 'film', 'Apparently', 'writers', 'gave', 'information', 'character', 'only', 'direction', 'Lyne', 'gave', 'was', 'act', 'pretty', 'What', 'waste', 'talent', 'Finally', 'what', 'was', 'up', 'boy-ish', 'looking', 'daughter', 'had', 'was', 'one', 'more', 'frightening', 'elements', 'film.Outside', 'characters', 'Lyne', 'fantastic', 'job', 'building', 'suspense', 'tension', 'Douglas', 'Close', 'consistent', 'powerful', 'use', 'phone', 'add', 'extra', 'violin', 'shrill', 'was', 'blast', 'jumped', 'little', 'bit', 'time', 'phone', 'rang', 'film', 'showed', 'power', 'Lyne', 'had', 'household', 'devise', 'also', 'structured', 'story', 'well', 'giving', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'space', 'time', 'players', 'did', ""n't"", 'focus', 'heavy', 'just', 'Douglas', 'jumped', 'back', 'forth', 'Close', 'well', 'allowing', 'see', 'different', 'perspectives', 'development', 'only', 'struggle', 'structure', 'film', 'was', 'why', 'Douglas', 'Was', 'pure', 'spontaneity', 'sleep', 'Close', 'was', 'tensions', 'troubles', 'home', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'understand', 'bit', 'clearer', 'why', 'Douglas', 'decided', 'destroy', 'seemingly', 'perfect', 'family.Overall', 'was', 'impressed', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'was', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'do', 'credit', 'keeping', 'attention', 'two', 'hours', 'ran', 'literally', 'could', 'not', 'keep', 'eyes', 'off', 'Close', 'was', 'amazing', 'film', 'see', 'other', 'reason', 'performance', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'was', 'classic', 'man', 'story', 'included', 'Lyne', 'atmosphere', 'tension', 'erotica', 'script', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'tweaking', 'intensity', 'was', 'there', 'could', ""n't"", 'answer', 'phone', 'week', 'watched', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'little', 'thriller', 'feminist', 'us.Grade', '***', '*****']",N/A

241402,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6300988767,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","While the overall film may be a tad predictable (okay, a lot predictable) and the genre itself has been pushed practically to the breaking point, it all doesn't seem to really matter with a film as wonderfully constructed as `Fatal Attraction'.  Sure, it spawned a lot of disappointing copycats, but the original is still just as steamy and just as intense as it ever was.So, I'm sure we all know the story by now, but I'll give you a quick run down.  Dan Gallagher is lawyer with a wife and daughter who engages in a weekend fling with a potential client named Alex Frost.  When the weekend ends, so does their affair and Dan returns to his wife and child.  Alex though, is not ready to let her new man go and so she pursues him, stalks him even.  As her pursuit becomes threatening Dan fears that he will not be able to get rid of her without divulging his affair to his wife; but soon, when Alex crosses the line, he realizes he has no choice but to fight back.Really, it's the acting that takes this to another level.I am not the biggest fan of Michael Douglas, but he really nails this performance.  He gets under his characters skin and brings these real and raw emotions to the surface, especially in scenes where he is violently accosting Glenn Close.  He brings an air of vulnerability that makes his actions all the more effective.  Now, I am a HUGE fan of Glenn Close, and here she does not disappoint.  She is deliciously effective as Alex, a borderline crazy, hostile lover who spews aggressive sensuality with every movement.  Some have balked that she is not attractive, but that is not the point of the performance.  I think that it works so much better having a technically `unpretty' actress play Alex because it shows the power of seduction.  She is a master of overpowering and trapping her prey.  Anne Archer deserves major props for making Beth, Dan's wife, much more than just a clich&eacute;d background character.  She breathes a real life into Beth, and tackles her fragile state with a self empowerment that really raises her performance (thus garnering a much deserved Oscar nomination).So, truth be told this is not anything groundbreaking, although it did prove to be one of the first universally lauded and accepted thrillers (it even got a Best Picture nomination at the Oscars, which is rather unheard of for a film of this nature).

The interesting and exciting portion of thi film is actually the kill portion of the film which the dead woman at first bounce back to alive as she still have some breathe in the water which the married man did not notice.Reviews by:Ang Poon KahPhD (Prof) in political science from Cambridge University and NUS.PhD (Prof) in Neuroscience from Cambridge University and NUS.PhD (Prof) in Technology from Cambridge University and NUS.PhD (Prof) in Security System from Cambridge University and NUSPhD (Prof) in Computer from Cambridge University and NUS.PhD (Prof) in film from Cambridge University and NUS.PhD (Prof) in Business from Cambridge University and NUS.PhD (Prof) in Electronics Engineering from Cambridge University and NUS.Bachelor degree in computer studies from Techco UniversityZakkers film director (upcoming film the Da Vinci Code),5,about the movie fatal attraction......,1146441600,"05 1, 2006",2006,1372,"['bought', 'code', '1', 'Singapore', 'hee', 'hee', '.and', 'R', 'film', 'rated', 'M18', 'only', 'allowed', 'audience', '18', 'years', 'view', 'Here', 'reviews', '-The', 'story', 'woman', 'whom', 'not', 'married', 'managed', 'hook', 'married', 'man', 'whom', 'have', 'happy', 'family', 'work', 'discussion', 'result', 'woman', 'refusal', 'leave', 'married', 'man', 'results', 'kills', 'perished', 'married', 'man', 'wife', 'struggle', 'story', 'end', 'photo', 'married', 'man', 'family', 'living', 'happily', 'interesting', 'exciting', 'portion', 'thi', 'film', 'actually', 'kill', 'portion', 'film', 'dead', 'woman', 'first', 'bounce', 'back', 'alive', 'still', 'have', 'breathe', 'water', 'married', 'man', 'did', 'not', 'notice.Reviews', 'Ang', 'Poon', 'KahPhD', 'Prof', 'political', 'science', 'Cambridge', 'University', 'NUS.PhD', 'Prof', 'Neuroscience', 'Cambridge', 'University', 'NUS.PhD', 'Prof', 'Technology', 'Cambridge', 'University', 'NUS.PhD', 'Prof', 'Security', 'System', 'Cambridge', 'University', 'NUSPhD', 'Prof', 'Computer', 'Cambridge', 'University', 'NUS.PhD', 'Prof', 'film', 'Cambridge', 'University', 'NUS.PhD', 'Prof', 'Business', 'Cambridge', 'University', 'NUS.PhD', 'Prof', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Cambridge', 'University', 'NUS.Bachelor', 'degree', 'computer', 'studies', 'Techco', 'UniversityZakkers', 'film', 'director', 'upcoming', 'film', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code']",N/A

Actually it's funny, until I watched this DVD, I'd only seen the chopped-up TV version of the film, and I don't think I'd ever laid eyes on the (evidently) notorious kitchen sink scene at all.  I bet there's still a VHS tape in my parent's basement with the lame G-rated ""Fatal Attraction"" on it complete with vintage commercials.Well here you get the whole thing complete with F-words and nipples and no commercials, plus the fabled original ending.  This, by the way, is impossibly anticlimactic in comparison with the ending they ended up with, and it's easy to see why test audiences found it unsatisfying in the first place.  The ""Madame Butterfly"" scene with Glenn Close is dramatic and gruesome, but in a sombre, distant, emotionally detached way - and the way that Michael Douglas and family hear about what happened, you feel like you must've dozed off and missed something.  (I'm trying to be cryptic so as not to give it away totally.)  The ending we all knew and loved is way more Hollywood balls-out teeth-bared eyes-popping insane, so if you were expecting another scenario with that kind of energy, forget it.  But Close apparently fought hard for the original ending, probably because it's such an iconographic, immortalizing shot, Whistler-picturesque yet Goya-gory.So, the film itself.  It's funny how movies from 15 or 20 years ago seem sort of transparent and obvious cuz you've seen the same stuff rehashed the same way so many times.  We get the set-up of Douglas as an enviable example of ""everyman"" with his perfect American-dream homelife, his little girl with the haircut like a boy, his perpetually bleary-eyed, stuffy-nosed soccer mom of a wife (Anne Archer in typical form).  He's a lawyer earning a comfortable living and essentially has no reason to mess around.So of course he does.  Classic Noir.  He meets Close - who certainly does look fatal with that ludicrous blond electric-socket afro - at a business party, then later at work.  Then wifey goes out of town with the kid for a weekend; Close closes in; and next thing you know they're doing the dirty dishes.  Then they go down in the elevator.  Then...etc.  By the end of the weekend Douglas is coming to his senses after repeated head-shrinkings, and starts to pull away from Close.But she won't be ignored.The performances are theatrical and over-the-top across the board.  It looks like everybody was trying to scream and flail their way to an Oscar.  People were worried about whether Close could play ""sexy"" - I think this was a couple years before ""Dangerous Liasons"" - and while she's not exactly my cup of tea, she's convincing in her charisma with Douglas.  For his part, the great son of Kirk just does his shtick, which is playing the neo-noir hero who lets his lust carry him away.  Anne Archer, see above, bleary-eyed stuffy-nosed soccer mom.  Add em all together and you have a decent movie, certainly pretty entertaining even if laughable in parts.

Michael Douglas plays the naturally hapless married man who is left alone for the weekend by his beautiful and ever-so-patient wife (Anne Archer). While his wife is away, he meets Alex (Glenn Close), they tryst at her apartment, spend a weekend together and then go their separate ways. Trouble is, she doesn't want to let him go back to his wife, opting instead to become a hideous sham of a villain who is never really evil, just criminally insecure. No one ever forces Mike to face the fact that he has cheated on his wife and that he has to face the responsibility for not only sleeping with Alex but also taking her on picnics and frolicking with her in the park (he even brought the family dog) and then deciding that it was only casual because he wanted it to be so. As one of my good friends once so brilliantly put it, don't participate in the montage unless you're willing to stick around for the long run. Furthermore, no one ever forces Deardon to take responsibility for using the determined, self-confident woman as a template for the most unspeakable evil (not to mention an embarassing witch who screams like a banshee and brandishes a huge knife like a slasher-movie villain). On the upside, the movie is slick and well edited, featuring a great image-breaking performance by Close that almost convinces you that the movie is worth taking seriously.",3,"Fun, but does it have to be so offensive?",1041984000,"01 8, 2003",2003,1578,"['wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'more', 'anti-feminist', 'movie', '1980s', 'one', 'according', 'screenwriter', 'James', 'Deardon', 'feminism', 'enemy', 'tough-talking', 'women', 'are', 'secretly', 'evil', 'psychopaths', 'boil', 'rabbit', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'naturally', 'hapless', 'married', 'man', 'who', 'left', 'alone', 'weekend', 'beautiful', 'ever-so-patient', 'wife', 'Anne', 'Archer', 'wife', 'away', 'Alex', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'tryst', 'apartment', 'spend', 'weekend', 'together', 'then', 'go', 'separate', 'ways', 'Trouble', ""n't"", 'want', 'let', 'go', 'back', 'wife', 'opting', 'instead', 'become', 'hideous', 'sham', 'villain', 'who', 'never', 'really', 'evil', 'just', 'criminally', 'insecure', 'one', 'ever', 'Mike', 'face', 'fact', 'cheated', 'wife', 'face', 'responsibility', 'not', 'only', 'sleeping', 'Alex', 'also', 'taking', 'picnics', 'frolicking', 'park', 'even', 'brought', 'family', 'dog', 'then', 'deciding', 'was', 'only', 'casual', 'wanted', 'be', 'so', 'one', 'good', 'friends', 'once', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'put', 'do', ""n't"", 'participate', 'montage', ""'re"", 'willing', 'stick', 'around', 'long', 'run', 'Furthermore', 'one', 'ever', 'Deardon', 'take', 'responsibility', 'using', 'determined', 'self-confident', 'woman', 'template', 'most', 'unspeakable', 'evil', 'not', 'mention', 'embarassing', 'witch', 'who', 'banshee', 'huge', 'knife', 'slasher-movie', 'villain', 'upside', 'movie', 'slick', 'well', 'edited', 'featuring', 'great', 'image-breaking', 'performance', 'Close', 'almost', 'convinces', 'movie', 'worth', 'taking', 'seriously']",N/A

If we watch this movie fairly and objectively, we can see that this is most certainly the case here.To make a long story short, Douglas is a good lawyer who is going through the stress of climbing the ladder of success. He has friends and a nice wife, as well as a 6 year old daughter. He meets an editor (Glenn Close) through work and he quickly has an affair with her. We are allowed to think that possibly, Douglas's wife was paying too much attention to the daughter and ignoring him. Or perhaps Douglas was just stressed from his job. (Either way, we have some reason why he accepts the offer of an affair.)Moving on, Douglas tries to go back to his legitimate life, but finds that Glenn Close is not going to tolerate being 'used' and then just dumped in the garbage. To complicate things further, Douglas has made Glenn Close pregnant. (Great so far.)Now, here is where we run into problems. The story tries to make Glenn Close out to be the villain. But let's be honest here. She did NOT FORCE Douglas to sleep with her. Douglas agreed to it. Then he tries to say he loves his wife and is happy with her. Well, Glenn Close is VERY RIGHT when she says: ""If you were so happy with your wife, what were you doing with me?"" And in all honesty, how can we not side with her a little when she says: ""You had your fun, and now you just want to go back to your quiet life.From here, the flaws start to get worse and worse. The simplest way I can put it is that the movie tries to make a hurt woman who has some psychological issues into an evil monster who has to be destroyed, and it tries to make the man who had an affair with her, got her pregnant, and wanted to just walk away as if nothing happened a hero. It just doesn't work.A grand scale error is when Douglas goes to Close's house and brutally assaults her. Excuse me. This is a lawyer, and he doesn't know how stupid this is? (Even from a selfish standpoint, this is not going to help the matter if he wants Glenn Close arrested.) And even worse. Are we suppose to be cheering for him? Is it Glenn's fault that he consented to this affair? Is it Glenn's fault that he thought he could use her and walk away?Reality check...A smarter man may have suggested a group therapy session with a psychologist....(And as a lawyer who understood confidentiality, he would have known his wife would never know about the affair from the mouth of the psychologist! The trip could have even been covered easily. He could have just said he was meeting with a client.)Now the worst error. The original end (and at least we can see it as an extra on the dvd) tied things together nicely. Because of her severe depression and hopelessness, Glenn Close kills herself, and Douglas gets the blame because his prints were on the knife Glenn Killed herself with. (GREAT! And it underlines how stupid it was to go to Glenn's house and assault her.) In one option, Douglas was suppose to kill himself in prison.

241424,A2PBV1899CX3TE,6300988767,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[2, 2]","Fatal Attraction was the second highest grossing film of 1987, slightly behind Three Men and a Baby but ahead of Beverly Hills Cop II. Adrian Lyne (Foxes, Flashdance, 9 1/2 Weeks, Indecent Proposal...) is a director not known for subtlety, but he knows how to push the audience's buttons, and here he has turned in a well crafted product. Thanks to Fatal Attraction the term ""Bunny Boiler"" has entered the lexicon -- in the U.K. it refers to an emotionally unstable woman who may become a stalker if given any attention.Though tons of actors were considered for both Dan Gallagher and Alex Forrest, and the director was against casting both Michael Douglas and Glenn Close, in retrospect, they were the perfect choices, and they both turned in exceptional performances, especially Glenn Close. For Close, Alex Forrest is perhaps her defining role, the thing she is best known for. She is very proud of playing Alex Forrest, and reportedly even has the knife from the kitchen confrontation scene hanging in her own kitchen.Let's take a peek and see how she sets up this potent little thriller. She starts off with a little flirtation and hints that she is aware of the unwritten rules of the game:----------------Alex Forrest: You must have to be discreet.Dan Gallagher: Oh, god yeah.Alex Forrest: Are you?Dan Gallagher: Am I what?Alex Forrest: Discreet?Dan Gallagher: Yes, I'm discreet.Alex Forrest: Me, too.===========================Danger, Will Robinson! The only way she is discreet is she is discreet about being a psycho!-----------------Alex Forrest: [to Dan] We were attracted to each other at the party, that was obvious! You're on your own for the night, that's also obvious... we're two adults.=========================This is where you start to feel sympathy for Dan Gallagher. You see, she is offering a no-strings-attached deal. He loves his wife and family, but oh, you kid...----------------------------Alex Forrest: [on the phone to Dan] Bring the dog, I love animals... I'm a great cook.=====================================She loves animals, all right -- if they are properly cooked. She has a great recipe for Rabbit Sauce Piquant, Braised Rabbit With Wild Mushrooms, Seared Rabbit With Lemongrass Risotto, Belgian Hare a La Maryland, Rabbit in Stilton-Mustard Sauce, or her specialty: Boiled Bunny.---------------------Alex Forrest: [to Dan] Well, what am I supposed to do? You won't answer my calls, you change your number. I mean, I'm not gonna be ignored, Dan!===============================Glenn Close will not be ignored after playing this role. She has gone from seductive sophisticate to irrational psycho in 60 seconds, and not only is she believable, she is also downright scary. She is like Toshiro Mifune as Macbeth in the Kurasawa film Kumonosu j. Though he takes a hale storm of arrows and is looking like a porcupine, he brushes them off like so many gnats. She is like the Energizer Bunny of Death, she keeps going, and going, and going...Though she may have lost out to Beth Gallagher, the loving wife of Dan, who even remembers who played Beth Gallagher?One Night at McCool's(2001) ....

She would go as far as to cooking his daughter's rabbit. She would go as far as kidnapping his daughter and treating her to the carnival, while his wife is desperately trying to find her daughter. FATAL ATTRACTION is the top thriller of 1987 and it has helped every married man on earth keep his snake locked in the cage.Dan Gallagher (played by Michael Douglass) is a successful lawyer. He has a beautiful wife, Beth Gallagher (played by Anne Archer), and they have a charming six-year-old daughter, Ellen. On one particular Friday night, Dan and Beth are off to a book party with their friends, Jimmy and Hildy. There, Dan meets the beautiful Alex Forrest (played by Glenn Close), a senior editor working in Dan's company. After Beth and Ellen head off to Beth's parents for the weekend, Dan heads off to work for a meeting. Alex shows up at the meeting, where she and Dan have a harmless dinner. But Alex's flirtations and sexual innuendos are more than noticable. She and Dan spend the whole weekend together. But as Dan tries to leave that Sunday night, Alex becomes unstable to the point of slashing her wrists. Dan takes care of her and goes on his way, with a guilty conscience. For the next few weeks, Alex begins tormenting Dan, calling him day and night. She has gotten to the point of calling his appartment. Beth answers the phone, but everytime she does, Alex hangs up. Alex tells Dan that she is pregnant and she refuses to have an abortion. Dan continues to tell her that he made a mistake in sleeping with her and that he is now finished. But Alex is not about to just let Dan walk out on her. After learning that Dan has changed his number, Alex shows up at his appartment. Nothing of their affair is revealed just yet.Dan and the family move out to the country into a bigger place. Hoping that this will stop Alex's petty torments, Dan begins to feel a sign of relief. That is until after he and the family return from Beth's parents. Dan has bought Ellen a white rabbit, but Beth finds the poor innocent rabbit cooking in a pot. Dan reveals to Beth that this Alex's doing, leading him into telling Beth that he had an affair with her. She throws him out right then and there, but not before he calls Alex, telling her that Beth now knows. Beth gets on the phone and simply states that, ""...If you ever come near my family again, I swear I will kill you. Do you understand?..."" You would think Alex would have left it alone after having being threatened, but Alex does not want to let go just yet. She picks Ellen up from school and treats her to the carnival for some fun, leaving Beth in a serious state of panic. Desperately trying to find her daughter, Beth gets into a serious car accident. She may have been bruised and may have received a broken arm, but Beth is just fine. After seeing Beth in the hospital, Dan waits outside Alex's apartment building. Usually, you would have to ring the apartment's buzzer to be let in, but Dan has something up his sleeve. Some friends leave the building, where Dan finally enters. He reaches Alex's apartment and rings the bell. As she answers the door, Dan busts in and pratically kills Alex by strangling her. Knowing that he'll be charged for first degree murder, he lets go of Alex. Alex comes charging at Dan with huge butcher knife, but he stops her and puts the knife on the counter. The lieutenant doesn't help much. Dan tells him that he'll be picking up Beth from the hospital and the two will be at home for the weekend with Ellen. Beth has realized that Dan made a stupid mistake, so she has decided to forgive him.Beth is in the bathroom, getting ready to take a bath, as Dan waits in the kitchen, making a cup of tea for Beth. But Beth turns around and finds Alex at the bathroom door. She begins attacking Beth, but Dan, hearing Beth's screams, runs upstairs and into the bathroom for one final match. He grabs Alex by the throat and throws her into the tub full of water, drowning her. She stops suddenly, seemingly drowned, but she jumps out of the tub, ready to stab Dan with the same knife she used before.

Glenn Close becomes a beautiful temptress and I believe that she really stretches herself as an actress.  There are many other actresses that I believe would more quickly come to mind to play this role but Glenn Close makes it her own.  This takes talent as an actress and before this movie I had only seen her in an ensemble role in ""The Big Chill.""  In the course of ""Fatal Attraction,""  She goes from being a professional woman with a few minor issues which would not seem too dangerous at first, to a woman who becomes completely unhinged and capable of murder.  Michael Douglas is a typical man in that position who does not mind a one night stand even though he is ""happily"" married to a beautiful woman played by Anne Archer.  Anne Archer also must take a turn from being a happily married woman with one child to a person who will do anything to protect her family, even murder, although her killing Glenn Close would be considered self defense, legally, it is still murder.  Glenn Close went from falling in love with Douglas to wanting to possess him and desiring to have the life with him that Anne Archer has.  She intensely desires to control him.  Each action she takes after learning of her pregnancy takes her closer to the edge and closer to being a homicidal maniac.The gradual changes of the characters is done in a very subtle way.  Glenn Close is not shown as manipulative in the first half of the movie.  Michael Douglas perhaps changes the least in the course of the film although he does get into a very violent fight with Glenn Close in an attempt to end her reign of terror.  This of course, does not work and only leads to the conclusion.  The movie is well directed by Adriene Lynn.  It contains pretty graphic sex, violence and nudity.  Again, in my opinion, Glenn Close is awesome in this movie and will always be remembered for this part.  In addition, the supporting characters are very fine.  I particularly enjoyed the police officer who Douglas went to who took a pretty blase attitude about the whole issue and pretty much told Douglas, well man you did what you did and now it is your problem, not mine.  That attitude was cool. The supporting characters brought out the fact that Douglas/Archer/Child had a regular suburban life and he was an up and coming attorney until Close character shattered everything.When viewing this film, I have often wondered how it would have looked with Anne Archer as the temptress and Glenn Close as the wife.

It was a 'favorite topic of conversation about the office water cooler' for a number of weeks. At the time, it was a shocker. Nowaways.....who knows? As we become more and more desensitized to violence, sex and profanity, it takes a lot more to shock us.Still, this movie had memorable moments that have stayed with us who first saw it at the theater 20 years ago. Most of those memorable scenes, if not all of them, involve Glenn Close's character, ""Alex Forrest."" Man, this is a woman who would not be denied what she wanted: in this case, married man Michael Douglas.No sense going into all the details. Everyone knows them by now, anyway. Looking back, I think the film was a good lesson for men (or women) thinking about cheating on their spouses and assuming nothing bad will happen as a result. Men may commit more crimes, but that old adage about a ""woman scorned"" certainly is demonstrated here in spades! Douglas' character, ""Dan Gallagher,"" certainly can attest to that, but he is anything but a sympathetic character. Both actors do a superb job in here, but kudos also to the rest of the Gallagher family, played by Anne Archer (wife ""Beth"") and Ellen Hamilton Latzen (daughter ""Ellen."")Also, the cinematography shouldn't be overlooked.

While the Emperor isn't a bad film this was 10 times better. It's almost perfect, but I do notice that there were some loose threads in this film such as: Why was Alex Forrest's father's death such a traumatic event for her? and then what about Alex's mother? She's not mentioned at all which leads me to wonder about Alex's behavior throughout the whole story. There seems to be 3 faces of Alex which has her as a seductress, aggressive Madame Butterfly the next, and finally the one where she's fully competent. I bring up Madame Butterfly as this seems to be a loose adaption of the opera only Alex doesn't kill herself if anything she's the one who seems to want to kill....kill,kill,kill anyone who stands in her way. This was a transistion for actress Glenn Close who played more wholesome women in her previous films here she's the full on bad girl. She was also denied the oscar for best actress here, and that's another crime. Mind you I'm sure the Academy was probably stuck between a rock in a hard place choosing over this, and The Last Emperor"" because I'm sure they felt some pressure about being diverse, and picking a morally good picture to be the best that year.

She is perfect as the dangerous woman who just can't get Douglas out of her head.  Some disturbing scenes are added to show Close's psychotic side such as the rabbit scene.  As Mrs. Gallagher comes to the boiling pot to see what it holds we see the innocence of her child running towards the rabbits cage, an excellent comparision.  It's up to Dan Gallagher to make a harsh decision to tell of his affair but at what price?  Will Mrs. Gallagher forgive and forget and if so will Alex Forrest leave the family alone and is she really pregnant? We are left with all these questions to linger in our minds which shows that this is a very suspensful, puzzing chiller.  The final scene is one of terror as Alex comes down to seek revenge on Dan's treatment of her... Excellent thriller which deserves a lot of praise and a credit to the actors who worked so hard at being so realistic.",5,Nail biting thriller.,954806400,"04 4, 2000",2000,1328,"['do', ""n't"", 'what', 'film', 'astounded', 'veryoriginal', 'script', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'answer', 'host', 'excellentactors', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'psychotic', 'obsessive', 'woman', 'scorned', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'weekend', 'fling', 'passion', 'quot', 'wife', 'away', 'quot', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', 'incredibly', 'steamy', 'add', 'effect', 'movie', 'film', 'laced', 'ironic', 'subleties', 'As', 'well', 'see', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'dark', 'side', 'perfect', 'dangerous', 'woman', 'who', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'Douglas', 'head', 'disturbing', 'scenes', 'are', 'added', 'show', 'Close', 'psychotic', 'side', 'such', 'rabbit', 'scene', 'Mrs.', 'Gallagher', 'boiling', 'pot', 'see', 'what', 'see', 'innocence', 'child', 'running', 'towards', 'rabbits', 'cage', 'excellent', 'comparision', 'up', 'Dan', 'Gallagher', 'make', 'harsh', 'decision', 'tell', 'affair', 'what', 'price', 'Will', 'Mrs.', 'Gallagher', 'forgive', 'forget', 'so', 'will', 'Alex', 'Forrest', 'leave', 'family', 'alone', 'really', 'pregnant', 'are', 'left', 'questions', 'linger', 'minds', 'very', 'suspensful', 'puzzing', 'chiller', 'final', 'scene', 'one', 'terror', 'Alex', 'down', 'seek', 'revenge', 'Dan', 'treatment', 'Excellent', 'thriller', 'lot', 'praise', 'credit', 'actors', 'who', 'worked', 'so', 'hard', 'being', 'so', 'realistic']",N/A

241437,A1FDW1SPYKB354,6300988767,David Von Pein,"[2, 2]","""Fatal Attraction"" was a huge hit in the late summer and fall of 1987, earning $320-million at the box office following its premiere on September 11, 1987. And after first seeing the film on home video some years ago, I can understand why it was so popular.In my opinion, this movie succeeds on many different levels -- it's the quintessential ""stalker"" flick, it's a terrific thriller, and even succeeds to a degree as a pretty good love story too (between star Michael Douglas and wife Anne Archer, who are both excellent in their roles here).Glenn Close plays ""Alex Forrest"", and she makes the part her OWN after sinking her teeth into it. After seeing the film, it's hard to imagine anyone else being as good in the role. But, I suppose this is also true of many (or most) other movie roles as well.But Glenn wasn't the first choice for the part of Alex. In fact, I've heard she was fourth. The filmmakers originally had Debra Winger in mind for this part. And while I'm sure Debra would have been good in the role too, I'm glad that Glenn Close ultimately won out and got the part. Glenn, btw, turned 40 years of age during ""Fatal's"" filming. While the object of Glenn's ""fatal attraction"", Michael Douglas, was 42 when he made this motion picture.Both Glenn and Michael seem ideally suited for their roles here. Both are utterly and totally believable throughout the film. Glenn is so good here that we're never quite sure, through the bulk of the movie, whether she's REALLY crazy or not. She walks that fine line nicely.Another very good piece of casting in the film was that of Douglas' and Archer's young daughter, Ellen. This part was played by Ellen Hamilton Latzen (who turned 7 during production). Ellen is absolutely adorable in this movie. A perfect choice. Every time I see her, I want to wrap her up and take her home.""Fatal Attraction"" provides the viewer with many memorable moments, one of which I consider to be one of the most realistic-looking physical altercations ever filmed for a movie -- that being the scene where Michael Douglas angrily confronts his female nemesis in Alex's apartment. You can almost FEEL Douglas' rage and fury come through the screen as he struggles with his antagonist in this superlative scene. It's the kind of scene that leaves the viewer, as well as the actors on screen, physically and emotionally exhausted after it's over. A remarkable scene indeed.""Fatal Attraction"" comes to DVD via this well-done single-disc ""Special Collector's Edition"" from Paramount Studios, with lots of goodies inside. There's a wealth of behind-the-scenes featurettes and rehearsal footage included here, plus other extras. Let's take a gander at the supplements:>> Three separate Making-Of documentary features -- ""Forever Fatal"" (28 minutes); ""Social Attraction"" (10 minutes); and ""Visual Attraction"" (19.5 minutes).>> ""Rehearsal Footage"" -- Featuring multiple scenes being rehearsed by stars Michael Douglas and Glenn Close. Some really good stuff here. Running time = 7 minutes.>> Alternate (Original) Ending -- This originally-conceived ending of the film is included here as a 9-minute bonus supplement. Very good scene too. It's not quite as exciting as the ending that wound up in the final cut of the movie; but a well-done scene nevertheless. And a welcome bonus on this Special Edition DVD.>> Feature-Length Audio Commentary Track with Director Adrian Lyne.>> Theatrical Trailer.---------------------------------------A very nice package of extra material indeed. This disc also has a foreign-language soundtrack (in French), plus three English audio tracks (including the Director's Commentary).More Stats/Data About ""Fatal Attraction: Special Collector's Edition"" ............................>> Video -- Anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1). .... The picture quality looks very good here, IMHO. The video does look a tad ""soft"", but I'm guessing this was the desired look of the film by Director Lyne. Overall, an excellent video transfer to DVD.>> Audio (English) -- Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround and Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround.>> Audio (French) -- Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo.>> Subtitles -- English only.>> Paper Enclosure(s)? -- Yes; 1-sheet Chapter Listing (17 scenes).>> Film's Run Time -- 1 hr., 59 min.>> MPAA Rating -- R.>> Color or B&W;? -- Color.---------------------------------------""Fatal Attraction"" was nominated for 6 Academy Awards, including ""Best Picture"" (but ""The Last Emperor"" took the prize). Glenn Close was also nominated, but was defeated for ""Best Actress"" honors by Cher (who won for ""Moonstruck"").Interestingly, Michael Douglas DID win the ""Best Actor"" Oscar that year, but it wasn't for ""Fatal"". He copped the statue for another of his fine 1987 performances, ""Wall Street"".If you want to curl up with a good thriller, then placing this disc of ""Fatal Attraction"" into the DVD player would not be out of order in the least.

241438,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,6300988767,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[10, 12]","In 1987, the thriller ""FATAL ATTRACTION"" was released into theaters and the film touched a nerve worldwide that it became a social phenomenon and a box office hit.  The film jumpstarted a wave of many psychopath films right after but also generated fear for men who have ever contemplated an extramarital affair.The film was directed by Adrian Lyne (""Indecent Proposal"" and ""Nine 1/2 Weeks"") and was produced by Sherry Lansing and Stanley R. Jaffe (both worked on ""Indecent Proposal"", ""Black Rain"" and ""The Accused"").  The film also featured the talents of composer Maurice Jarre (""I Dreamed of Africa"", ""Sunshine"", ""Dead Poets Society"", ""Jacob's Ladder"" and ""Ghost"") and cinematographer Howard Atherton (""Indecent Proposal"", ""Deep Rising"" and ""Lolita"").The film would star well-known talents such as Michael Douglas (""Basic Instinct"", ""Wall Street"" and ""A Perfect Murder""), Glenn Close (""Air Force One"", ""Damages"" and ""Hook"") and Anne Archer (""Privileged"", ""Rules of Engagement"" and ""The Art of War"").Needless to say, ""FATAL ATTRACTION"" had elements of the 1971 film ""Play Misty & Me"" but shocked America and the world of the implications of a one night stand, hurting the people around you and to be careful of the unknown and in this case, the unknown was having a one night stand with a psychopath.VIDEO & AUDIO:""FATAL ATTRACTION"" gets its first HD treatment on Blu-ray via 1080p High Definition.  The film looks great for a film of its age.  Because it was shot in 1987 and seeing many films in the late 80's and early 90's being heavily DNR'd (digital noise reduction) and looking too soft in picture quality, ""FATAL ATTRACTION"" definitely showcases the detail of the surroundings but also brings out the grain throughout the film.  Personally, I would have grain (since it's part of film) rather than excessive DNR and edge enhancement.The film showcases its vibrancy in colors during the outdoor segments but the indoor segments, really interesting use of lighting to show the differences between Daniel's home and Alex's home and how things continually got darker and darker.  ""FATAL ATTRACTION"" doesn't have the cleanest picture quality but compared to its DVD counterpart, this is probably the best we are going to see of this film on High Definition.  Blacks are nice and deep and I didn't see any major compression artifacts or dust.As for the audio, the film is presented in English 5.1 Dolby TrueHD (including French Dolby Surround and Spanish mono).  ""FATAL ATTRACTION"" is primarily a dialogue-based film where moods and ambiance is brought to life by the music of Maurice Jarre.  Overall, dialogue is clean and understandable and music is quite clear.There are some scenes where you can hear the New York surroundings and crowded scenes (such as the party scene) where you can hear the people around the room.  But to tell you the truth, I felt the audio was front channel heavy.  I didn't hear much coming from the rear surrounds but the subtle noises as the chilling water drips near the end to the operatic music of Madame Butterfly come quite clear in audio but then, even the single gun shot noise that you hear in the film really doesn't have any punch to it.  But in the end, it's the acting and the dialogue that is the priority and how the music enhances the moods of love, sex, despair and violence is what I felt was most important and those two things come clear through the lossless audio.As for subtitles, ""FATAL ATTRACTION"" is presented in English, English SDH, French, Spanish and Portuguese.SPECIAL FEATURES:""FATAL ATTRACTION"" comes with the same special features that came on the 2007 DVD Special Edition release.  There is nothing that is new to the Blu-ray but the alternate ending and the trailer are featured in HD.  Included are:* Commentary by Adrian Lyne - I have watched a few films with commentary by Adrian Lyne and he's the first person to tell you that he doesn't have the greatest memory.  With that being said, with his commentary for ""FATAL ATTRACTION"", he does remember enough to discuss the details of making the film and talks about it in detail.  Especially how many cuts it took for certain scenes, working with the talents such as Michael Douglas, Glenn Close, Ann Archer and the child Ellen Hamilton Latzen.  Lyne is upfront about having to reshoot ending and his thoughts of the ending on the final cut of the film.  But like previous Lyne commentaries, there are times when he just stops talking.  Perhaps watching the film again has captured his attention for a short while.  Lyne's commentary is also a bit soft and low, so you may need to turn your speakers up a bit.* Forever Fatal: Remembering Fatal Attraction - Cast & Crew Interviews - (28:15) A wonderful featurette about the making of the film.  From working with James Dearden and then finding the talent who would be right for the film (Michael Douglas was already in consideration) and why they chose the talent to portray those roles but also learning how no studio or director wanted to do the film.  What was amazing to hear is how Glenn Close fought for the original ending.  As an actress so into her craft, she researched her role for Alex Forrest and felt the ending was perfect but at the screening of the preview, audiences disliked the ending and thus they reshot the ending to the film despite Glenn Close being against it.  And of course, discussion about how the film became a phenomenon and the worldwide media coverage that it received.  Presented in Standard Definition.* Social Attraction - The Cultural Phenomenon of Fatal Attraction - (10:00)  ""FATAL ATTRACTION"" became a cultural phenomenon.  On one side, it received media coverage because of how shocking the thriller was.  The film became popular among psychiatrists but the film also received backlash by feminists.  Presented in Standard Definition.* Visual Attraction - Behind-the-Scenes Production Featurette - (19:39) In order to create the world of ""FATAL ATTRACTION"", a lot was done in set design, makeup and just creating this overall, visual sense of the film.* Rehearsal Footage - (7:05) The original rehearsal footage of Glenn lose and Ann Archer.  If you thought their acting was powerful in the film, the rehearsals were just as powerful!  Presented in Standard Definition.* Alternate Ending with an Introduction by Adrian Lyne (HD) - (11:51) The original ""Madame Butterfly"" ending.  In the end, I would have to agree with the filmmaker and happy they changed the ending for the final cut.* Original Theatrical Trailer (HD) - (1:33) The original theatrical trailer presented in High Definition.JUDGMENT CALL:I'm not going to lie to you, ""FATAL ATTRACTION"" scared the crap out of me when I first watched it many years ago and it scared the crap out of me watching it again over 20 years later.I remember it becoming a cultural phenomenon, in my opinion, because ""one night stands"" are always shown as things that happen in life but the film shows us the ramifications and the dark side that exist.  Sure, we would see a break up of a relationship or a divorce from infidelity on film but ""FATAL ATTRACTION"" explores the side heavily and doesn't miss a heartbeat.  Instantly, showing us a woman who would not be ignored, has some psychological problems and how she became obsessed.You can analyze this film on the psychiatric side of things or the human-side of things and ask yourself, who is at fault?  Who is the victim? In a way, all are victims in a way.The film was powerful in a sense that Glenn Close played Alex Forrest, a troubled woman just perfectly.  Her gaze, her look, everything about her sent shivers down my spine.  But its what Glenn Close said on the special features that when playing the part, she felt there was some major trauma that this woman had gone through long ago to be this way.  And Close did a good job of researching and bringing this character out and making her alive, but also terrifying.Michael Douglas is just the ""everyman"" in this role.  A normal, hardworking person with a family that he loves but now has to deal with the ramifications of his extramarital affair and the implications it has on his family, to Alex and to himself.  Anne Archer as Beth was the wife one would want.  A good mother, loving wife and it's just unfortunate that like in real life, even these good people become a victim.  Fortunately, for Archer's character, despite the loving, family and caring tendencies, she's also a strong woman who will not let anything happen to her family.  Archer's chemistry with Douglas was also terrific to watch.I think that the alternate and original ending to the film can be debated.  I've read that critics prefer the original but of course, the one that was reshot and is in the final cut was what was needed to please the audience.  It was great to hear every on the film comment about having to reshoot the scene.I'm just glad that all special features from the 2007 DVD Special Edition are included on this Blu-ray release.  Although, nothing new added to the Blu-ray, ""FATAL ATTRACTION"" is still a solid Blu-ray release.""FATAL ATTRACTION"" is a well-done thriller.  The acting is terrific, the screenplay was absolutely captivating and yet terrifying.  For those wanting an excellent thriller for their Blu-ray collection, you can't go wrong with this film.",4,"Blu-ray: Nothing new added to the Blu-ray release from the 2007 SE DVD Edition but for

The story is very convincing, as this kind of nerve racking situation could very well happen to a man or woman, who cheats on his/her spouse....by sleeping with a psycho, who would do anything to threaten the couple's marriage, if that person couldn't be indulged! This can happen! Douglas plays the husband, who discovers this intriging woman, Close, at a book social - they meet and, soon, become attracted with each other! His wife goes away for a weekend to her parent's house - and Douglas begins a brief and secretive affair with Close. After that weekend, Douglas goes on with his work and life, as if nothing ever happened. His wife returns with their young daughter, and the family lives happily ever after....that soon changes when Close begins harassing him with phone calls at work and at home; the blood begins to boil as her harassment begins to put him over the edge! The secret between them could be leaked out by her....so he has to do everything in his power to keep a lid on this liaison....the tension between the two gets more heated as the film goes on! It will keep you glued to the screen and on the edge of your seat....it's that good of a film!!!! The infamous boiling bunny scene is effective, in showing just how crazed Close's character is in getting back at Douglas! This is one roller coaster of a ride....you'll see!!!!

241442,A2198FZZMTJ38H,6300988767,D. Litton,"[8, 9]","""Fatal Attraction"" isn't so much an erotic thriller as it is a stalker suspenser. Sure, the movie begins with the standard lurid sex scenes involving two respected actors pawing at each other like there's no tomorrow. But rather than succumb to such torrid displays of goofy, laughably cheesy eroticism, the material actually becomes interesting in its second half, building a solid sense of menace and intensity around the mind games of its psychotic centerfold.Michael Douglas stars as Dan Gallagher, a lawyer whose firm's clients include a well-known publishing company in New York City. His wife, Beth (Anne Archer), has hopes of moving out of their city apartment and buying a house in Bedford, where she and their young daughter travel for the weekend. And as they say, when the cat's away, the mice will play, which is just what Dan does when he crosses paths with Alex Forrest (Glenn Close), an editor from the publishing company whom he spends the weekend with.So far, so mediocre. The various conversations between characters meant to advance the plot are silly and ongoing, while the inevitable images of lustful satisfaction between Douglas and Close provide some unintentional laughs that seem to work in the film's favor. Once you see these two credible performers manhandling one another, you have a choice: you're either in or you're out.The film picks up considerable momentum once the reality of the situation sets in. Dan realizes that he can't continue seeing Alex, who becomes embittered when he avoids her phone calls and dismisses her from his office after an invitation to the opera. As he tries to juggle his secret and keep up the pretence of happiness with his family, Alex acts as a thorn in his side that keeps inching deeper and deeper, until he acknowledges the fact that she is a real threat to his family's safety.This turn of events isn't as unexpected as it would hope to be; from the various expressions of underlying menace that grace Close's face, we can already gather that she's cooking up more than just spaghetti for dinner. But, as we wait in breathless anticipation of Alex's next move, the shocks multiply, the suspense grows, and everything we initially thought about the film's beginning act is but a memory as we follow the plot into familiar yet overall satisfying grounds.Much of this rests on the shoulders of Close, who carries her character so well that any inhibitions one may have about the extent to which her character will go are left behind. Alex's coolly-calculated, ultimately psychotic plan of attack gives way to moments of sheer lunacy that Close masters with little more than a delightfully menacing smirk. When Dan finally comes clean and gets the police involved, we know just what she's going to do, and how she's going to do it, but under such a brooding performance, it all seems fresh.It's also quite nice to see Michael Douglas squirm as the victim of the movie's role-reversal, where this time, the woman makes all the rules. His performance here is commendable, and he does show a sincere amount of fear and worry over the revelation of his dark secret, and the safety of his wife and child. His scenes with Close carry their weight in sweaty-palms tension, as well as some sweet lessons about the consequences that he must face as a result of his affair.If you have the stomach to stick with ""Fatal Attraction,"" you may find yourself enjoying it for its acting zeal and wonderfully-executed second half.

A perceptive inclination to gander at a short skirt, a hint of cleavage, a heart-pounding hip wiggle.  I ran smack dab into a door the last time I gawked, but consider myself darn lucky compared to Michael Douglas' character in FATAL ATTRACTION--a white-knuckled &quot;don't-let-this-happen-to-you&quot; thriller that vividly demonstrates what can happen to a guy when he lets other parts of his anatomy do his thinking for him.Manhattan lawyer Dan Gallagher (Douglas) has it all:  successful career, attractive wife, loving daughter.  So why not have an extramarital fling with a woman he met at a party while the family is out of town?  Sure.  Just a one-night stand.  No harm, no foul.  But there's something very &quot;foul&quot; about Dan's partner in crime, because blonde Alex Forrest (Glenn Close) may have all the right moves in the sack, but she also has an elevator that doesn't go all the way to the top.  So when Dan wants to shake hands and part company, Alex will have none of it, and the table is set for a one-way ticket to Looney Land.Let the stalking. . .the suspense. . .the thrills and chills. . .begin.  The bathroom scene, in which Dan's frazzled wife Beth (Anne Archer) wipes the steam off the mirror, is worth the price of purchase of this video alone.Director Adrian Lyne (as usual) delivers a gripping, antacid-popping story.

241444,A38UHOCEKSUOSP,6300988767,"dominion_ruler ""Bryan""","[1, 1]","It is no doubt that Fatal Attraction is a classic, and fatal attraction are two words you've most likely heard at some point in life even if you haven't watched the film.  Without even going into details I will already say this is a must-see movie, basically for anyone who likes good movies in general.  If you are into thrillers then the experience will be all the better.  It is certainly entertaining to a point, but I must admit from a guy's point of view, every time I watch this it confirms that I will never cheat on my wife when my day of marriage arrives.  While this is a film and it probably exaggerates the situation to a degree, nevertheless the near perfect acting create convincing situations that make this movie feel very real.  Well, Dan's wife was probably a little too easy on him in the end, but that's just my opinion.Fatal Attraction has a lot going for it that has made it a memorable classic.  Michael Douglas and Glenn Close give superb performances.  The affair they encounter is played out very well, as is the extreme obsession Alex (Glenn Close) continues to have for Dan when they part ways and he returns to his family.  As mentioned earlier, the obsession is a bit ongoing at times, but still believable and is what makes Fatal Attraction what it is.  Glenn Close can become downright scary at times with her obsession.  Constant phone calls and stalking are just the tip of what this woman does, and eventually almost anything seems possible and creates a lot of fun, and yet scary suspense throughout the movie - which only increases to the climactic ending.I'm not sure I would say Glenn Close steals the show, because Michael Douglas does a teriffic job too.  Caught as the man in the middle, his frustration only heightens when he discovers that Alex is pregnant and refuses abortion.  As smart as he is and as much as he tries to hide the truth from his wife, there is just no going around it - the truth is revealed.  He was not sloppy in his efforts, it just goes to show what goes around comes around and there is no escaping it.This is a great movie that is both entertaining and (though probably not the intention, but nevertheless) makes a loud statement about cheating on your spouse and its consequences.  Though containing sex, nudity, language and violence, Fatal Attraction never glorifies any of it and uses it only when necessary to make a very good, believable film.Acting - 5Characters - 4.5Story - 4.5Suspense - 4.5Overall - 4.5",5,[4.5] Men...all the more reason to never cheat on your wife,1218240000,"08 9, 2008",2008,2484,"['doubt', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'classic', 'fatal', 'attraction', 'are', 'two', 'words', ""'ve"", 'most', 'likely', 'heard', 'point', 'life', 'even', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'film', 'even', 'going', 'details', 'will', 'already', 'say', 'must-see', 'movie', 'basically', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'movies', 'general', 'are', 'thrillers', 'then', 'experience', 'will', 'be', 'better', 'certainly', 'entertaining', 'point', 'must', 'admit', 'guy', 'point', 'view', 'time', 'watch', 'will', 'never', 'cheat', 'wife', 'when', 'day', 'marriage', 'arrives', 'film', 'probably', 'situation', 'degree', 'nevertheless', 'near', 'perfect', 'acting', 'create', 'convincing', 'situations', 'make', 'movie', 'feel', 'very', 'real', 'Well', 'Dan', 'wife', 'was', 'probably', 'little', 'too', 'easy', 'end', 'just', 'opinion.Fatal', 'Attraction', 'lot', 'going', 'made', 'memorable', 'classic', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'give', 'superb', 'performances', 'affair', 'encounter', 'played', 'out', 'very', 'well', 'extreme', 'obsession', 'Alex', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'have', 'Dan', 'when', 'part', 'ways', 'family', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'obsession', 'bit', 'ongoing', 'times', 'still', 'believable', 'what', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'what', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'can', 'become', 'downright', 'scary', 'times', 'obsession', 'Constant', 'phone', 'calls', 'stalking', 'are', 'just', 'tip', 'what', 'woman', 'eventually', 'almost', 'anything', 'possible', 'lot', 'fun', 'yet', 'scary', 'suspense', 'movie', 'only', 'climactic', 'ending.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'would', 'say', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'show', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'teriffic', 'job', 'too', 'Caught', 'man', 'middle', 'frustration', 'only', 'when', 'Alex', 'pregnant', 'abortion', 'As', 'smart', 'as', 'much', 'hide', 'truth', 'wife', 'just', 'going', 'truth', 'revealed', 'was', 'not', 'sloppy', 'efforts', 'just', 'show', 'what', 'around', 'around', 'escaping', 'it.This', 'great', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'probably', 'not', 'intention', 'nevertheless', 'loud', 'statement', 'cheating', 'spouse', 'consequences', 'containing', 'sex', 'nudity', 'language', 'violence', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'never', 'only', 'when', 'necessary', 'make', 'very', 'good', 'believable', 'film.Acting', '5Characters', '4.5Story', '4.5Suspense', '4.5Overall', '4.5']",N/A

Steigman ""Movie fan from silents to now""","[1, 2]","I finally got to watching this again after not seeing it for years and having watched the lackluster wanna be known as Obsessed.This film really delivers in the suspense, drama and so forth. Michael Douglas decides to have a one night stand with Glenn Close. She turns out to be a maniac. For those who have not seen this & have been curious about it - check this one out. This is the way suspenseful film making should be done.The first thing that came to my mind is why Douglas cheated on his wife anyway - I personally found his wife much more attractive than Close. Not only that but it was presumed that he was happy and had it all. He was a rich lawyer, the wife, the kid , the home, the dog. His character did not seem like the type who would cheat, but one can never tell these days. I guess his animal instincts came out when he saw her and there was an attraction. One can also never tell what the consequences are for cheating, which in this case takes it to extreme levels. I would have liked to have explored Closes' character a little more about why she is who she is. It was touched on a little bit, but more would have been better..Watch for a rabbit scene which will have animal rights people having fitsand watch for a scene with Close's whites of her eyes showing (no eye balls) - this was a truly terrifying scene(it reminded me of a movie called Diabolique also worth seeing)Overall this is an fantastic suspenseful edge of your seat thriller type of movie, which can also be seen as a pioneer of films of this sort.

When I first started watching it, I didn't have very high hopes for it: Michael Douglas? (I don't think he's that great an actor, his fame just stems from his dad.) Probably another predictable story-line, just like most if not all other thrillers. Well, as it turned out, I was very impressed with Mr. Douglas's performance--very convincing. The storyline WAS predictable, but in some parts it was handled very well--the rabbit scene, VERY well done. (No pun intended.) I did feel, however, that the movie sympathized with Michael Douglas's character too much. It only made sense that he be the one to sympathize with after the horrific rabbit-scene. Although Glen Close played her part VERY well too, I couldn't understand why Douglas fell for her in the first place. She wasn't THAT sexy or good looking. Handsome, at best. And then there's that kid--the girl. Problem is, she looks like a guy. Even at that age you can usually tell by the hair-length and face, but here it was nearly impossible. The ending I saw--the one where the wife shoots Glen Close--was dreadfully predictable. I HATE IT when movies do that. Apart from those VERY MINOR points, this movie did very well in being scary, mostly realistic, and getting some morals across. This movie definitely does not glorify adultery. Something movies need to do more often. As for the length, I didn't think it was that bad. Between 2 and 3 hours, but a very FAST 2-3 hours.

The dvd picture qauilty is terrible, only the godfather one was this bad, lines and specks, horrible color contrast, grain and areas where the color has faded. Parmount why did'nt you remaster this.

I've just re-watched this flick, and it's just as effective as when I first viewed it. Picture a younger Baby Jane Hudson combined with Jaws, and that's pretty much ""Alex"", Glenn Closes' woman scorned. Michael Douglas, as the typical, successful, arrogant, mid-'80's Yuppie, who, though perfectly nested in a seemingly great marriage to gorgeous, giving, Anne Archer, has to prove he's still a desirable stud by having a ""casual"" (WRONG!!) fling with Closes' ""Alex"", a sexy, also seemingly  sophisticated associate of his. She initially gives the impression she wants the same thing as he, a ""no strings attached"" sex-fest, but, after a 24 hour marathon, while wifey is out of town, it begins to become apparent that Alex is becoming just a teensy bit possessive, and when Douglas, as diplomatically as possible, tries to explain to her that he's happily married, and it's dumpster time, Miss Alex IS NOT buying it. The ensuing  harassment of he and his family, which starts with pranks from Alex to express her displeasure, turns into a horror-ride that will have your emotions tap dancing faster than Ann Miller!! Some people feel the need to rationalize the entirety of a film, ""why'd she do that"", that wouldn't happen"", etc... not me. With a film like this, it either entertained me, or didn't. Well, this one certainly did. I found all the acting excellant, and the situation not all that unbelievable. Though ""over the top"", it is a non-stop ride of suspense as Douglas' nightmare (and life) un-folds. I recall there were some copy-cat flicks made shortly after this came out, trying to duplicate what this film has. Well, they didn't succeed, and were soon forgotten.

241453,AY12DBB0U420B,6300988767,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","Last night's bargain-rack movie was the ""Fatal Attraction"" DVD starring Michael Douglas and Glenn Close. I bought it at Wal-Mart. The movie was a bit scary and held the attention well. Boredom was never a problem. The story involved a lawyer (Douglas) who met a woman (Close), who's in publishing, at a large social gathering. The meeting was almost accidental, but there was a mutual attraction and Close was very upfront about her interest and availability. In fact, she was a bit overwhelming. Douglas, happily married to a beautiful wife (Anne Archer) and with a fine daughter, yielded to the temptation and had a fling while his wife was gone visiting her parents for the weekend. End of story? Not quite. It seems that Close was not willing to just break the affair off and continued to pursue Douglas in an ever increasingly menacing stalker fashion. If you've ever had a problem like this, it will make your hair stand on end. Trust me.I suppose almost everyone has had a stalker of one type or another or to one degree or another. It's just part of life and relationships. But Close is a stalker that went way beyond the ordinary annoying level. In fact, Close went so far beyond that the movie actually became rather hard to believe as it proceeded to the bitter end. It struck me as an almost grotesque exaggeration of a plausible situation. Well, that's Hollywood and the entertainment industry.The movie was well done. The acting was quite good. The story flowed along and, although somewhat implausible, gripped your attention rather well.

A few of us went to the theater to see it once it was released. Needless to say, the place was packed and this film was an unexpected blockbuster and movie houses all over the country were raking in the sales from this film. Even as a male, I never felt uncomfortable and as tense as I did when watching this movie for the first time, especially when the audience was mostly female.We all know the story. A high-powered Manhattan Attorney (Dan)lives the perfect life. A cushy job in the city and cozy home and idyllic family that begins in the city and winds up in the Conn.'burbs. A chance encounter with blonde bombshell Alex leads to a steamy roller coaster ride that takes the viewer on a wild journey throghout the film.Even though Douglas also had another great film that year, ""Wall Street"", I thought his performance in this movie was much more powerful and riveting.This film was made for more than just ""entertainment"", but it also came out during the height of the AIDS crisis and the peak of the indulgent, live for today '80s. It sent a message that if you cheat, there are dire consequences.If you haven't seen this movie, definitely make time to do so. This film has a re-run ability that few movies do. It's still just as powerful and engaing in 2008 as it was in '87.

By doing so she starts making harrasing phone calls, destroying his car, and in the memorable rabbit boling scene. Douglas finally has enough and has the courage to tell his wife of his fling and she flips out on him and rightfully so. So in a last chance to save his marraige he confronts the psychopath in her apartment and the two have an all out battle with Close &amp; Douglas chasing each other all around. Great scene was when out of nowhere Close comes at Douglas with a butcher knife, Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned that saying is effectivley shown in this film. All this leads to the climatic finale at Douglas's home when Close tries to kill them all but is shot down by Douglas's wife. There are two endings to this film i know of this ending and Close ending up killing herself and having Douglas arrested.  This film is done in almost the same style as Clint Eastwood's PLAY MISTY FOR ME(1971) But something about this film makes it creative and unforgettable thanks to the chemisty of Douglas &amp; Close.

Becoming a big hit in 1987 and years to come, Fatal Attraction crossed boundaries that film did not dare to cross in earlier years and caused this to be one of the most talked about films ever.  With Adrian Lyne fresh of the FLASHDACE success, the direction makes this first so much better and more of a eye feast with everthing placed so logically.  Many thrillers now have hints of ideas used in Fatal Attraction in them.  Fatal Attraction was more than just a groundbreaking box-office hit.Michael Douglas (giving an amazing performance) stars as Dan, a man married to a wonderful wife and father to a joyous daughter, who has dinner with a woman after a job meeting on the weekend when his wife goes to look at a new house.  The woman, a stylish and sexy Glenn Close (who gives a nail-bittingly astonishing performance) whose character's name is Alex, first sees Dan at a book party when they have a quick chat together at the bar.  When at dinner Alex begins to bring up the idea that they are two lonely adults both looking for some fun, and the next thing we know they are in the apartment.After this one-night stand, Dan returns home to a call that his wife is staying another night because she could not go see the house.  With another night of no wife, Dan gets a call from Alex who persudes Dan to spend another night with her.  After contemplating another night of doing his relationship wrong, Dan goes back to Alex.  Later in the film, Dan tries to shrug Alex away from him, but Alex will not feel like a ""slut that Dan can bang when he feels"".  Now the terror begins.  A loving father and a loving husband who has an affair tries to get back into a normal family life but the thought of Alex always searching for him and the thought of her being able to tell his wife whenever she gets in a bad mood, frightens him.With chills and intrigument galore, Fatal Attraction turns into a mindblowing plot twister.  The cast is fantastic, with career roles for both Michael Douglas and Glenn Close. Director Adrian Lyne shows an understanding of how to turn the visual screws with his camera movement and angles.  Fatal Attraction turned out to be steep competition for all films and thrillers made in the years following.  With both critical and movie-goer praise, this film seemed to impress all who watched.The DVD includes over three hours of bonus material that includes the following: Commentary Track, Featurette, Rehearsal Footage of both Michael Douglas and Glenn Close, Alternate Ending, and the Theatrical Trailer.

241465,A3FKVJ0SJR2EA0,6300988767,J.C. Correa,"[1, 1]","One of the best things about this DVD is a featurette that looks back on the cultural impact of &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; and reaction to such back in the late 80's, particularly in regards to the feminist movement.  Equally valuable is the inclusion of the originally filmed ending that had to be re-shot due to poor test screenings.  Watching it, it is easy to understand why the new ending was more viewer-friendly than its artistically superior predecessor.  In essence, you get to be the judge.  All in all though, this is a good edition of one of the most popular and talked about Hollywood thrillers of the last twenty years.  The story of what happens when a casual one-night stand destroys the life of one man and his innocent family is the sort of stuff that most will find intriguing for ages to come.  It is definitely a film that prompts conversation and discussion after viewing it.  Taut, albeit being somewhat formulaic and predictable, the movie benefits from an all out performance by Glenn Close as the notorious &quot;other woman&quot; with a Madame Butterfly complex (the latter is explored more on the original ending).  This role was certainly a high point of Close's career, and rightly so.  In retrospect, it's hard to imagine anyone else in the role.  Hearing her speak about it in the included interviews fifteen years later is very interesting, especially when it comes to her not-so-subltle defense of the original ending.

241473,A33TED651NAXWU,6300988767,"Johnny Williams ""High School History Teacher""","[1, 5]","**Spoiler Alert****Spoiler Alert**The movie Fatal Attraction made in the 1980's is another film that is indicative of the time that it was produced.  It is another film that shows the ever changing lifestyles of the American people, the choices they make and the effects that those choices have not only upon themselves but others as well.  This film plays upon several of the characters rather poor moral choices and shows consequences that can erupt from such behavior.The morality choices in the film are whether that he should have cheated on his wife to whom he has been married several years to gain in the course of his love affair an instant gratification that is seen very often in the culture of the 80's.  It portrays men with an instant gratification, I can get what I want attitude, and that they are in control of their lives.  Still morality values play a significant part of those choices to either do or not do.It also shows that emergence of women in the white collar work force.  While there have always at least in recent modern history been some women as such, this was the timeframe in which many women could be seen as breaking from traditional gender roles and becoming a taking a larger role in the work force.  However as the movie does denote that success can be had by a woman, it also tells us that that women, unlike a man, must pay a price for such success.  That price is getting older, becoming an old maid, won't have a family or kids, at that that price in itself might be too high for women who want those type of things to pay.  The movie does not tell us that there is a middle ground for women, only that a choice must be made to which design in life you which to pursue, that of a career or that of a family.An argument could be made that pertains to the fact that a woman is a villain, much as Alex was in the movie, if they do not take the path of the family.  That if the women is successful and career driven she is a threat to those around her.  This threat could range from being a threat to men whereby they assume masculine gender roles, same type of work, want the same type of pay etc.  The threat to stay at home women that are wives to husbands in the work place is that the women in the work place can become better acquainted with their husbands and perhaps spend more time with their husbands at work, than the wives is at home;  throw into the mix that men in this time period are of a sort that require instant gratification,  approval, and reminder of self importance and worth, with a dash of curiosity, intrigue and lust, and the woman in the work place seems less than a go getter and more of a secretarial whore that destroys families.Other things in the movies that stands out and make you rethink position is that of cheating, divorce, and kids.  The movie constantly reminds us that it is those things which are likely to come from or be hurt by such instant gratification such as cheating.  The movie also reminds us, albeit in present day, of the chance of aids, and how he was terrified that she didn't use protection; now whether this was a hark unto just pregnancy, or whether just not much was really known about aids at the time  is up for conjecture, perhaps he thought she used spermicide, or an IUD or other contraceptive device (which was thought to be enough protection to stop aids in the early days of misinformation on the disease)In any case the movie states to the audience to do the right thing, make your choices morally correct and have a better life for it.  The movie says that marriage, kids, and the life in suburbia are worth fighting for and that a sexy midnight rendezvous with a screaming hot blonde might just lead you into places you don't want to be.  It is this message that underlies that moral choices are not only made for our benefit but as well as those whom surround us.If these types of movies appeal to you, then you should get it here at amazon.  Fatal Attraction is one of the widely known movies of the 80's, so get it for your collection for nothing other than that reason, it will probably be remembered and talked about 20 more years from now.",4,A Fatal Attraction or Men Are Studd Muffins,1290729600,"11 26, 2010",2010,4154,"['**Spoiler', 'Alert****Spoiler', 'Alert**The', 'movie', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'made', '1980', 'film', 'indicative', 'time', 'was', 'produced', 'film', 'ever', 'changing', 'lifestyles', 'American', 'people', 'choices', 'make', 'effects', 'choices', 'have', 'not', 'only', 'upon', 'others', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'several', 'characters', 'rather', 'poor', 'moral', 'choices', 'shows', 'consequences', 'can', 'erupt', 'such', 'behavior.The', 'morality', 'choices', 'film', 'are', 'should', 'have', 'cheated', 'wife', 'whom', 'been', 'married', 'several', 'years', 'gain', 'course', 'love', 'affair', 'instant', 'gratification', 'seen', 'very', 'often', 'culture', '80', 'men', 'instant', 'gratification', 'can', 'get', 'what', 'want', 'attitude', 'are', 'control', 'lives', 'Still', 'morality', 'values', 'play', 'significant', 'part', 'choices', 'do', 'not', 'do.It', 'also', 'emergence', 'women', 'white', 'collar', 'work', 'force', 'have', 'always', 'least', 'recent', 'modern', 'history', 'been', 'women', 'such', 'was', 'timeframe', 'many', 'women', 'could', 'be', 'seen', 'breaking', 'traditional', 'gender', 'roles', 'becoming', 'taking', 'larger', 'role', 'work', 'force', 'However', 'movie', 'denote', 'success', 'can', 'be', 'had', 'woman', 'also', 'women', 'man', 'must', 'pay', 'price', 'such', 'success', 'price', 'getting', 'older', 'becoming', 'old', 'maid', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'family', 'kids', 'price', 'might', 'be', 'too', 'high', 'women', 'who', 'want', 'type', 'things', 'pay', 'movie', 'not', 'tell', 'middle', 'ground', 'women', 'only', 'choice', 'must', 'be', 'made', 'design', 'life', 'pursue', 'career', 'family.An', 'argument', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'fact', 'woman', 'villain', 'much', 'Alex', 'was', 'movie', 'do', 'not', 'take', 'path', 'family', 'women', 'successful', 'career', 'driven', 'threat', 'threat', 'could', 'range', 'being', 'threat', 'men', 'whereby', 'assume', 'masculine', 'gender', 'roles', 'same', 'type', 'work', 'want', 'same', 'type', 'pay', 'etc', 'threat', 'stay', 'home', 'women', 'are', 'husbands', 'work', 'place', 'women', 'work', 'place', 'can', 'become', 'better', 'acquainted', 'husbands', 'perhaps', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'husbands', 'work', 'wives', 'home', 'mix', 'men', 'time', 'period', 'are', 'sort', 'require', 'instant', 'gratification', 'approval', 'reminder', 'self', 'importance', 'worth', 'dash', 'curiosity', 'intrigue', 'lust', 'woman', 'work', 'place', 'less', 'go', 'getter', 'more', 'secretarial', 'whore', 'families.Other', 'things', 'movies', 'out', 'make', 'rethink', 'position', 'cheating', 'divorce', 'kids', 'movie', 'constantly', 'things', 'are', 'likely', 'come', 'be', 'hurt', 'such', 'instant', 'gratification', 'such', 'cheating', 'movie', 'also', 'present', 'day', 'chance', 'aids', 'how', 'was', 'terrified', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'protection', 'now', 'was', 'hark', 'unto', 'just', 'pregnancy', 'just', 'not', 'much', 'was', 'really', 'known', 'aids', 'time', 'up', 'conjecture', 'perhaps', 'thought', 'used', 'spermicide', 'IUD', 'other', 'contraceptive', 'device', 'was', 'thought', 'be', 'enough', 'protection', 'stop', 'aids', 'early', 'days', 'misinformation', 'disease', 'case', 'movie', 'audience', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'make', 'choices', 'morally', 'correct', 'have', 'better', 'life', 'movie', 'marriage', 'kids', 'life', 'suburbia', 'are', 'worth', 'fighting', 'sexy', 'midnight', 'rendezvous', 'screaming', 'hot', 'blonde', 'might', 'just', 'lead', 'places', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'message', 'moral', 'choices', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'made', 'benefit', 'as', 'well', 'whom', 'surround', 'us.If', 'types', 'movies', 'appeal', 'then', 'should', 'get', 'here', 'amazon', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'one', 'widely', 'known', 'movies', '80', 'so', 'get', 'collection', 'nothing', 'other', 'reason', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'remembered', 'talked', '20', 'more', 'years', 'now']",N/A
241474,A34D06JL7LC6MU,6300988767,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[5, 6]","""Fatal Attraction"" is a movie that has spawned countless cliches [...] and it's hard to believe that 19 years after it's release people still talk about it. Even more amazing is the fact that this movie was nominated for the Best Picture Oscar. Because of how many look-alike movies there are, it's weird. This movie is one of Adrian Lyne's finest hours, it's right up there with Lolita and Unfaithful. The movie stars Oscar winner Michael Douglas (Best Actor, 'Wall Street') as Dan Gallagher, a successful lawyer with a beautiful wife named Beth (Anne Archer) and a little daughter. Everything is perfect until, one day, Beth and his daughter Ellen go out of town and Dan has a one night stand with Alex Forrest (Glenn Close, TV's 'The Shield'). At least, it's supposed to be a one night stand. Problem is, the second day...Things begin to sour. Suddenly, Alex has a couple of mood swings and attempts suicide; But Dan returns to his normal life. Despite frequent harassment and phone calls at the hands of Alex. There's a twist that occurs in the middle of the film, which makes the movie's protagonist stress even more; But, it's cool.The rabbit scene is still infamous, if someone doesn't know the name of the movie...That's the way they figure it out. ""What's that movie called with the crazy chick and the rabbit?"" Anyway, the movie is really good, but I thought the final twist at the end (which you can see coming from a mile away and is used way too much, especially in today's horror films) was a bit much and frankly, pretty unrealistic. A lot of people might argue that this whole movie is unrealistic, but you'd be surprised. Close, Douglas, and Archer deliver fine performances in this film; But, it's pointless to recommend it. You've probably already seen it.GRADE: A-",5,Fatal Attraction,1153094400,"07 17, 2006",2006,1784,"['Fatal', 'Attraction', 'movie', 'spawned', 'countless', 'cliches', '[', ']', 'hard', 'believe', '19', 'years', 'release', 'people', 'still', 'talk', 'Even', 'more', 'amazing', 'fact', 'movie', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Oscar', 'how', 'many', 'look-alike', 'movies', 'are', 'weird', 'movie', 'one', 'Adrian', 'Lyne', 'finest', 'hours', 'right', 'there', 'Lolita', 'Unfaithful', 'movie', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Best', 'Actor', ""'Wall"", 'Street', 'Dan', 'Gallagher', 'successful', 'lawyer', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'named', 'Beth', 'Anne', 'Archer', 'little', 'daughter', 'Everything', 'perfect', 'one', 'day', 'Beth', 'daughter', 'Ellen', 'go', 'town', 'Dan', 'one', 'night', 'stand', 'Alex', 'Forrest', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'TV', ""'The"", 'Shield', 'least', 'supposed', 'be', 'one', 'night', 'stand', 'Problem', 'second', 'day', 'Things', 'begin', 'sour', 'Suddenly', 'Alex', 'couple', 'mood', 'swings', 'attempts', 'suicide', 'Dan', 'normal', 'life', 'frequent', 'harassment', 'phone', 'calls', 'hands', 'Alex', 'twist', 'middle', 'film', 'movie', 'protagonist', 'stress', 'even', 'more', 'cool.The', 'rabbit', 'scene', 'still', 'infamous', 'someone', ""n't"", 'know', 'name', 'movie', 'way', 'figure', 'out', 'What', 'movie', 'called', 'crazy', 'chick', 'rabbit', 'Anyway', 'movie', 'really', 'good', 'thought', 'final', 'twist', 'end', 'can', 'see', 'coming', 'mile', 'away', 'used', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'especially', 'today', 'horror', 'films', 'was', 'bit', 'much', 'frankly', 'pretty', 'unrealistic', 'lot', 'people', 'might', 'argue', 'whole', 'movie', 'unrealistic', ""'d"", 'be', 'surprised', 'Close', 'Douglas', 'Archer', 'deliver', 'fine', 'performances', 'film', 'pointless', 'recommend', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'already', 'seen', 'it.GRADE', 'A-']",N/A

I wouldn't have agreed and still don't.  I just enjoyed the film...both times.All of the commentary and features on the DVD make buying it well worth the cost.  Hearing the actors and creators speak of the film and how they believe it was taken seriously by the public, as well as all the interesting information about the casting, locations, and other insider details made me glad I added it to my DVD library, plus I got to watch the film again and see the alternate ending.  For the record, I prefer the one we saw in theaters.  I always pulled for Michael Douglas's character even if he brought the very destructive wrath of a scorned woman on himself.This film, along with 'Basic Instinct' provided Douglas with two of his finest roles.  Glen Close, who apparently had to be very aggressive to obtain her part in the film, displayed a whole new side of her talent that revealed true acting ability.There were definitely lessons to be learned from this chilling  film about an ordinary family who is virtually devastated when the ordinary husband/father meets an extraordinarily mentally unstable woman and has a short fling that quickly and unexpectedly flings his marriage and future into disarray, chaos, and very real jeopardy.The public in the long run probably didn't actually get the  message of what could happen to an individual of either gender as the result of a quick-fling with a virtual stranger.  We still seem to be a rather trusting lot, always thinking 'that won't happen to me'.Whether we got the message of not, many viewers loved this film the first time around.

When Douglas returns to his Monday Morning life, Close follows. Too Close.Close's manipulations and behavior spiral upward out of control as she follows him to work, calls incessantly, claims pregnancy, slashes her wrists, and begins to target Douglas' wife (Anne Archer) and child.As Close ratchets it up, a chastened Douglas tries desperately to make her go away, first with promises, then with threats. But Close will not be denied. The more Douglas tries to put her off, the more hopping mad she becomes.Close's madness becomes manifest in the famous scene where she boils the family's pet rabbit alive in their own kitchen. Afterward, the film settles into a predictable but well-done ""Nice Family vs. Crazy Stalker"" groove, somewhat like, but better than Rebecca DeMornay in THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE. Despite this step down into stereotype, FATAL ATTRACTION keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout.Douglas and Close both do a fine turn as the chief protagonists; this role was a career high for Close, who, while she can never fit the femme fatale mold, is very convincing here, as the 'fling'.

241481,A2NQUGGYM0DBM1,6300988767,L.A. Scene,"[5, 6]","In the mid 1980s, Michael Douglas began a streak of movie roles that would catapult him to superstardom.  The role of Jack Colton in ""Romancing the Stone"" and ""The Jewel of the Nile"" gave Douglas a commercial boost.  Things would soon start to change in 1987 when Douglas would move into more critically acclaimed roles.  The movie that would launch Douglas' critical success would be 1987's ""Fatal Attraction"".  In addition to being a landmark movie for Michael Douglas and his co-star Glenn Close, ""Fatal Attraction"" would redefine the role of the ""Thriller"" in Hollywood.  No longer would a Thriller just be a blood and gore movie - but now would be attached to a solid storyline while still providing all of the ""perks"" of that a ""Thriller"" can offer.In ""Fatal Attraction"", Douglas plays Dan Gallagher.  When Dan's wife, Beth (played by Anne Archer) goes away for the weekend with their daughter, Dan gets involved in a steamy weekend love affair with a work acquaintance named Alex Forrest (played by Glenn Close).  What Dan doesn't know is that Alex is a very unstable person. Alex falls for Dan and quickly develops feelings for him.  However Dan looks at things differently and really doesn't have any feelings for her.  When reality sets in for Alex that Dan is going to stay with his wife,  Alex will first turn suicidal.  These suicidal tendencies will then transform to obsession, then rage, and then deadly.While parts of the story are predictable, I think its the Director of ""Fatal Attraction"" that makes a big difference. I'm not an expert when it comes to directing, but it seems to me Adrian Lyne does one of the great directing jobs in a movie.  He does a great job at providing those ""shock"" moments that are so essential to a Thriller movie.  One example of this is early in the movie when Alex tries to commit suicide after Dan breaks off the affair with her.  Ultimately, Lyne's real strength is the ability to bring what I call ""bringing parallel scenes to a head"".  An example of this is the scene where we see Beth frantically searching for their daughter Ellen.  It turns out that Alex has kidnapped  Ellen and taken her to an amusement park.  Lyne will do a great job at paralleling the scenes with Beth in the car with a rollercoaster ride that Ellen and Alex are in.  We see this reach a ""head"" when Beth crashes the car.  Lyne will ""paint"" a virtual picture of the car and the rollercoaster coming to a ""head"".  We also see these parallels done in two other scenes:  First is the scene where Alex kills the family's pet Rabbit.  The other scene is the movie's finale when Alex breaks into Dan and Beth's house and sneaks up on Beth.  The acting in the movie by Douglas, Archer, and Close is good.  I can't say the acting elevates the film - to me the elevation in the film is enhanced by the way Lyne puts things together.There are some things that I don't think the movie does well.  For starters, I think the movie could have painted a better picture for helping us understand Dan's motivations for getting involved in an affair in the first place.  The movie leads us to believe that this is the first time that Dan has ever had an affair.  But what could have been done much better is to help us understand a bit more about Dan's character.  Was there ""deep pain"" within Dan's marriage?  Is having an affair inherent nature to Dan?  Was it truly a one time episode?  The other thing which is a mystery is that Alex tells Dan that she is pregnant.  One thing we learn throughout the film is that Alex is a pathological liar.  What we don't know is whether or not the pregnancy is another episode of Alex's pathological lying or not.  Finally, the ending does leave you hanging quite a bit.  Although the triangle between Alex, Dan, and Beth reaches a predictable ending.  We don't find out what the future is going to hold for Dan and Beth - that is something I would have liked to have known as part of the ending.Although they don't play major roles - there are three notable small supporting roles in the movie.  The first is Fred (""Herman Munster"") Gwynne.  In the 80s, Fred Gwynne made a comeback of sorts in his film career - playing small roles.  However, Gwynne's role in ""Fatal Attraction"" isn't very significant.  He plays ""Arthur"" who is a Senior lawyer in Dan's firm.  Another actor who has a supporting role is Stuart Pankin who plays Dan's colleague Jimmy.  Although Pankin isn't a household name, he one of those ""B"" line actors whose face and voice is familiar.  He has made many guest appearances on television series (""Knots Landing"", Falcon Crest""), but he is probably best known for being the voice of Earl Sinclair on the series ""Dinosaurs"".  Pankin's role on shows often provides comic relief.  He gets that opportunity in ""Fatal Attraction"" as well and although he has a bigger role than Gwynne, it still doesn't showcase his talents.  Finally Ellen Foley plays Jimmy's wife Hildy.  Foley is best known for singing the duet with Meat Loaf in his song ""Paradise by the Dashboard Light"".  Foley's character of Hildy will not be a significant one - but it's still worth noting who she is.While ""Fatal Attraction"" would revolutionize the way Thrillers would be done, it would also be a blueprint for television shows.  The ""Fatal Attraction"" storyline is a storyline that has been replicated many times.  Most notably, the hit television series ""Dallas"" used an identical storyline with Ray Krebbs.While there are some of these shortcomings, this film will still entertain from start to finish.  Nothing is dragged out - and you certainly won't be bored.  This movie is definitely one I'd recommend.",4,The Directing Elevates this Film,1121644800,"07 18, 2005",2005,5652,"['mid', '1980s', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'began', 'streak', 'movie', 'roles', 'would',

It was equally chilling watching things melt down as Alex refused to let go.As for Ellen and her haircut, I have never lost any sleep over it.  However, I will point out that Adrian Lyne has a habit of casting offbeat kids.  I though Erik Per Sullivan was great in Unfaithful, although from a strictly physical perspective he was not the cutest child.  It is hard telling, but perhaps Lyne does not want overly beautiful children upstaging his adult stars or storylines.I loved Fred Gwynne's cameo role as Dan's boss.  It was a shame that Gwynne was so typecast early in his career and that he only had a short list of serious film roles.My only real concern about Fatal Attraction is that some people perhaps walked away with the verdict that women are crazy.  We all need to bear in mind that men can just as easily unravel.  In the late nineties in Toledo there was a terrible ""Valentine's Day Massacre"" in which a man suffering from unrequited love left a far bloodier trail than the one you see in this movie.I wish this type of thing only happened in films, but men and women alike need to be on guard and realize that an unstable ""admirer"" could potentially melt down.

The guys instantly put a padlock on their pants. The girls begin to wonder if that's what they're like.Lets face it, all guys are gonna start drooling at the slightest hint of cleavage, like the reviewer before me who said he walked into a door. I'm talking from experience, when the guy you're walking with starts pointing it out on the street that people are looking, then you begin to wish you'd worn a different top. (And for Glenn Close it's called a padded bra darling) But this is what happens if you go further than just drooling.I've often wondered what all the fuss about this movie was. I knew it had Glenn Close and the not-so-lovely Michael Douglas in it, and I knew about the infamous bunny boiling scene, which coined the term, and was used most recently in the UK's Big Brother 5, to describe a contestant - unfortunately my namesake! But I'd never really watched it before last night. It didn't really appeal to me.The movie centres around a happy 80s family, all loved up, and with a little boy called Ellen. I know it's a strange name for a boy isn't it? (Oh for God sake, who puts that haircut on a little girl?! Any wonder why I thought she was a little boy?!)

I thought that was enough to put me off the film until we had Ellen copying what her mum was saying, which had me in fits, and then Dan's friend says that Glenn Close (Alex) was mentally undressing him, but she had a little trouble with the buttons. Then I thought this movie might be worth watching.Of course there's an attraction between Alex & Dan, despite the fact he has a massive gold band on his wedding finger - it's not there for show darling! And of course, his wife suddenly decides to go away, and Alex and Dan get it on in just about everywhere (including a very slow elevator, I wish they were all as slow as that) and probably in every position imaginable. Lets face it, if Dan's character was rubbish in bed, she wouldn't chase after him like that, is it? Unfortunately, we get see Michael's bare backside this time, and Glenn's very, very white chest. And I thought I had trouble getting mine to tan!I didn't find either of them particularly attractive in this, although my mum would say different about Michael. She was getting thrills of his butt, and I was reaching for the sick bucket. Glenn could look quite pretty, when she had the little fringe, but mum described her as being the ""ugliest looking unmentionable"". I'd use that to describe Michael! I've seen loads better.The movie was quite slow in places, and quite shocking - like Dan offering to pay for Alex's abortion. What a slap in the face. But was she ever really pregnant? Cos either there was a big time lapse, or she can see into the future, cos you can't tell that quickly you're pregnant!This movie will definitely scare the bejeezus out of you, and have you wondering whether to phone your boyfriend/husband or not! Glenn is truly scary, and during the climax (not that kinda climax, she probably faked it with him) I was gripping my mum's hand in terror! Michael actually did well as the harassed man, so hopefully all guys will learn their lesson from this guy.The extras on the DVD are pretty terrific. These are: commentary by director Adrian Lyne (who later did Indecent Proposal); ""Forever Fatal"": Remembering ""Fatal Attraction"" - new, exclusive cast and crew interviews; ""Social Attraction"": a look at the cultural phenomenon of ""Fatal Attraction""; ""Visual Attraction"": behind-the-scenes production featurette; rehearsal footage; and an alternate ending with introduction by director Adrian Lyne. It's obvious why the alternate ending was scrapped in favour of the one you'll watch in the film, as it was a big anti-climax, and if I'd watched that, instead of the other ending, I would have felt really let down.I finally understand what all the fuss is about this film, and it's pretty damn good. Just don't be put off by Glenn's chest or Michael's butt.

No matter - this is one heck of a thriller that combines terrific acting from Michael Douglas and  Glenn Close with a thought-provoking story. Douglas' married Dan Gallagher  and Close's Alex Forrest have a steamy affair while his wife is away.  Except that Alex decides that it's not over. Her Alex is a maniacal nutcase  who isn't above anything to keep Dan for herself, including terrorizing his  family and kidnapping his daughter. Anne Archer plays Dan's wife; it's a  role that many actresses can play in their sleep. She does a fine job, but  it's similar to her roles in Patriot Games and Clear and Present  Danger.There is a larger issue here, though, and one that was discussed  when the film was released: Aside from the moral problems of adultery,  doesn't Alex have a point ? Isn't she entitled to something besides simply  being used for a night or two ? The tension in this film is constant,  although a lot of it seems too easily foreshadowed.

241502,APN6DO7VHDLTN,6300988767,Missing Person,"[8, 8]","Although it may seem hard to believe for many of today's viewers, 1987's ""Fatal Attraction"" was considered to be quite a breakthrough upon its release.  There was even a lot of trouble in getting it off the ground because it was considered too risque and uncommercial.""Fatal Attraction"" was built up from a short film by screenwriter James Dearden, and the plot is admittedly pretty basic and straightforward.  Michael Douglas plays Dan Gallagher, a lawyer who's been married for 9 years to his wife Beth, played by Anne Archer.  Dan crosses paths with the Glenn Close character Alex Forrest for the first time at a business meeting.  Instantly attracted to her, he introduces himself to her, and when Beth goes on a weekend vacation...  Well, you can see where this is ultimately heading.Don't get the wrong idea though thinking that ""Fatal Attraction"" is an airheadedly assembled movie.  The premise may be simple, and the movie does kinda fall apart near the end, but apart from this, the scripting is masterful, the performances from Douglas and Close are intense and spellbinding, and Adrian Lyne's phenomenal, no-holds-barred directing keeps the suspense level ultra-high and the atmosphere just right throughout.  The movie also sucks you with in how realistic most of it feels--just check out the one-on-one dinner scene early on in the movie where Dan tells Alex that his wife is out of town--Douglas and Close absolutely go to town with this brilliantly-realized, compulsively watchable scene.Many viewers have complained that the movie doesn't zero in enough on why Dan would cheat on his wife in the first place.  However, the movie does make it clear that Dan is somehow feeling unsatisfied in his marriage.  There's a very sly scene early in the movie where Beth is seen in bed with their 6-year-old daughter Ellen, forcing Dan to sleep elsewhere.  Presumably Ellen is scared or just can't sleep, and yet when Beth informs Dan it'll just be for that one night, you can detect a sense of disgust from Dan--clearly, Dan's feeling unsatisfied in his marriage.The ending of the movie that was used for its theatrical release is highly debatable, and how you feel about it depends on the kind of person you are.  If you're the kind who feels that a man cheating on his wife is inevitable and bound to happen once or twice, then the movie's official ending will probably be satisfying to you; the producers seemed to feel that this is how the majority of the public feels, hence their decision to end the movie this way and make it more ""accessible"".  However, if you find cheating to be flat out inexcusable, you'll probably find it to be an incomplete, unresolved movie.  I see where the producers were coming from, but I feel they could have done better.  Alex Forrest is a deeply disturbed individual who undoubtedly has been sexually abused before her encounter with Dan, but that certainly doesn't make her psychotic behavior acceptable.  At the same time though, no one on the right mind is going to find Dan Gallagher to be a very likable man--he really is despicably selfish and deserves to suffer some for his actions.  It's a shame that the movie doesn't dig deeper into the marital issues of Dan and Beth, and also that it doesn't reveal more about what goes through Dan's mind regarding his actions, including having apparently gotten Alex pregnant.Ultimately, ""Fatal Attraction"" is flawed, but it sure is extremely entertaining and suspenseful, keeping you on the edge of your seat throughout, AND it sparked debate among its viewers about serious matters.  All that said, ""Fatal Attraction"" deserves to be hailed as, at least, a near-classic.The ""Special Collector's Edition"" DVD of ""Fatal Attraction"" is definitely THE version to have, containing tremendous bonus material that makes the whole experience even more worthwhile.  For one thing, you get to see the original ending of the movie before it was changed for theatrical release.  This original ending may not have the blood and guts of what was ultimately used for the movie, but it's extremely gripping and puts a whole new spin on things, and it's actually more effective and satisfying--it's a shame, on an artistic level, that it wasn't used for the movie.  There's also a nicely done, highly informative featurette containing interview material from Douglas, Close, Archer, Lyne, and the producers Stanley R. Jaffe and Sherry Lansing.",5,spellbinding performances and superior dialogue help make this irresistible despite its shortcomings,1132185600,"11 17, 2005",2005,4421,"['may', 'seem', 'hard', 'believe', 'many', 'today', 'viewers', '1987', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'was', 'considered', 'be', 'quite', 'breakthrough', 'release', 'was', 'even', 'lot', 'trouble', 'getting', 'off', 'ground', 'was', 'considered', 'too', 'risque', 'uncommercial', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'was', 'built', 'up', 'short', 'film', 'screenwriter', 'James', 'Dearden', 'plot', 'admittedly', 'pretty', 'basic', 'straightforward', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Dan', 'Gallagher', 'lawyer', 'who', 'been', 'married', '9', 'years', 'wife', 'Beth', 'played', 'Anne', 'Archer', 'Dan', 'paths', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'character', 'Alex', 'Forrest', 'first', 'time', 'business', 'meeting', 'Instantly', 'attracted', 'when', 'Beth', 'weekend', 'vacation', 'Well', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'ultimately', 'heading.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'idea', 'thinking', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'airheadedly', 'assembled', 'movie', 'premise', 'may', 'be', 'simple', 'movie', 'kinda', 'fall', 'apart', 'end', 'apart', 'scripting', 'masterful', 'performances', 'Douglas', 'Close', 'are', 'intense', 'spellbinding', 'Adrian', 'Lyne', 'phenomenal', 'no-holds-barred', 'directing', 'suspense', 'level', 'ultra-high', 'atmosphere', 'just', 'right', 'movie', 'also', 'how', 'realistic', 'most', 'just', 'check', 'out', 'one-on-one', 'dinner', 'scene', 'early', 'movie', 'where', 'Dan', 'Alex', 'wife', 'town', 'Douglas', 'Close', 'absolutely', 'go', 'town', 'brilliantly-realized', 'compulsively', 'watchable', 'scene.Many', 'viewers', 'have', 'complained', 'movie', ""n't"", 'zero', 'enough', 'why', 'Dan', 'would', 'cheat', 'wife', 'first', 'place', 'However', 'movie', 'make', 'clear', 'Dan', 'somehow', 'feeling', 'unsatisfied', 'marriage', 'very', 'sly', 'early', 'movie', 'where', 'Beth', 'seen', 'bed', '6-year-old', 'daughter', 'Ellen', 'forcing', 'Dan', 'sleep', 'elsewhere', 'Presumably', 'Ellen', 'scared', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sleep', 'yet', 'when', 'Beth', 'Dan', ""'ll"", 'just', 'be', 'one', 'night', 'can', 'detect', 'sense', 'disgust', 'Dan', 'clearly', 'Dan', 'feeling', 'unsatisfied', 'marriage.The', 'ending', 'movie', 'was', 'used', 'theatrical', 'release', 'highly', 'debatable', 'how', 'feel', 'kind', 'person', 'are', ""'re"", 'kind', 'who', 'man', 'cheating', 'wife', 'inevitable', 'bound', 'happen', 'once', 'twice', 'then', 'movie', 'official', 'ending', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'satisfying', 'producers', 'seemed', 'feel', 'how', 'majority', 'public', 'feels', 'hence', 'decision', 'end', 'movie', 'way', 'make', 'more', 'accessible', 'However', 'find', 'cheating', 'be', 'flat', 'inexcusable', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'find', 'be', 'incomplete', 'unresolved', 'movie', 'see', 'where', 'producers', 'were', 'coming', 'feel', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'Alex', 'Forrest', 'deeply', 'disturbed', 'individual', 'who', 'undoubtedly', 'been', 'sexually', 'abused', 'encounter', 'Dan', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'make', 'psychotic', 'behavior', 'acceptable', 'same', 'time', 'one', 'right', 'mind', 'going', 'find', 'Dan', 'Gallagher', 'be', 'very', 'likable', 'man', 'really', 'despicably', 'selfish', 'suffer', 'actions', 'shame', 'movie', ""n't"", 'dig', 'deeper', 'marital', 'issues', 'Dan', 'Beth', 'also', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'more', 'what', 'Dan', 'mind', 'regarding', 'actions', 'including', 'having', 'apparently', 'gotten', 'Alex', 'pregnant.Ultimately', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'flawed', 'sure', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'suspenseful', 'keeping', 'edge', 'seat', 'sparked', 'debate', 'viewers', 'serious', 'matters', 'said', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'deserves', 'be', 'hailed', 'least', 'near-classic.The', 'Special', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'DVD', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'definitely', 'THE', 'version', 'have', 'containing', 'tremendous', 'bonus', 'material', 'whole', 'experience', 'even', 'more', 'worthwhile', 'one', 'thing', 'get', 'see', 'original', 'ending', 'movie', 'was', 'changed', 'theatrical', 'release', 'original', 'ending', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'blood', 'guts', 'what', 'was', 'ultimately', 'used', 'movie', 'extremely', 'gripping', 'whole', 'new', 'spin', 'things', 'actually', 'more', 'effective', 'satisfying', 'shame', 'artistic', 'level', 'was', ""n't"", 'used', 'movie', 'also', 'nicely', 'done', 'highly', 'informative', 'featurette', 'containing', 'interview', 'material', 'Douglas', 'Close', 'Archer', 'Lyne', 'producers', 'Stanley', 'R.', 'Jaffe', 'Sherry', 'Lansing']",N/A

Michael Douglas, a successful businessman, has it all: loving wife and child, a happy home, a career.  And ... when his wife and daughter are out of town, he has a weekend with a single career gal.  When he wants to leave it behind and go back to his regular schedule, she makes several one sided plans as she has fallen head over Gucci loafers for him.  Her behavior goes from obsessive to psychotic.Oh my ... where oh where to start?  Nothing ever pointed out the ugliness of infidelity - not conservatives, not liberals, not the Church, not even AIDS/STDs - like this movie did.  Some of us clucked our tongues, others zipped up our pants, and others went home to their mates and said ""Oh no, baby, I love YOU"".  Some argued that this made people have affairs.  If anything this pushed that return to family values we all were tired of hearing and a push towards monogamy.I saw this 20 years ago as a kid, and as an adult it has a whole new light.  I clucked my tongue at it as a kid, he cheated on his wife he got what he deserved!  As an adult, I changed my mind.  Men cheat, and so do women.  We all cheat and are cheated upon.  Surprised?  I'm not, knowing what I know now.  The question is once you've screwed up, what do you do then?  Continue the affair or go back to your life?  Michael Douglas did the right thing in ending it, it's not worth throwing your marriage away just because you gave into a temptation.Glen Close's character made men cring, women cheer, and bunnies run and hide.  She won't be ignored.  But it made me wonder, about our tendencies as women to be jealous and how it overtakes us.  She pushed it to the limits finally culminating in violence, but she who never felt that want or need for a man may cast the first stone.  We are working against thousands of years of social conditioning, but women must remind themselves of their own worth and building self esteem.  It's only a man, after all.The Special edition DVD is fantastic, as it gives up insites into how and why the story evolved the way it did and to have the actors look back on how it moved and shaped them.  Glen CLose was the most hated woman in AMerica for a while.  Audiences were chanting ""Kill the bitch!"" in theaters to such an extent that they changed the ending.  This time when the screwballs spoke they knew what they were talking about when they asked for a different ending.  At long last, we got to see the original ending where Glen Close commits suicide and Michael Douglas is taken away by the police for her murder.  Hurray for the test audience!  They made the right decission with that one!  We wanted to see a confrontation between her and the wife, and they killed the bitch!",5,Infidelity and then some,1127433600,"09 23, 2005",2005,2771,"['Here', 'almost', '20', 'years', 'later', ""'re"", 'still', 'talking', 'movie', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'successful', 'businessman', 'loving', 'wife', 'child', 'happy', 'home', 'career', 'when', 'wife', 'daughter', 'are', 'town', 'weekend', 'single', 'career', 'gal', 'When', 'leave', 'go', 'back', 'regular', 'schedule', 'several', 'one', 'sided', 'plans', 'fallen', 'head', 'Gucci', 'loafers', 'behavior', 'obsessive', 'psychotic.Oh', 'where', 'oh', 'where', 'start', 'Nothing', 'ever', 'pointed', 'out', 'ugliness', 'infidelity', 'not', 'conservatives', 'not', 'liberals', 'not', 'Church', 'not', 'even', 'AIDS/STDs', 'movie', 'did', 'clucked', 'tongues', 'others', 'zipped', 'up', 'pants', 'others', 'went', 'home', 'mates', 'said', 'Oh', 'baby', 'love', 'argued', 'made', 'people', 'have', 'affairs', 'anything', 'pushed', 'return', 'family', 'values', 'were', 'tired', 'hearing', 'push', 'towards', 'monogamy.I', 'saw', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'kid', 'adult', 'whole', 'new', 'light', 'clucked', 'tongue', 'kid', 'cheated', 'wife', 'got', 'what', 'deserved', 'adult', 'changed', 'mind', 'Men', 'cheat', 'so', 'do', 'women', 'cheat', 'are', 'cheated', 'Surprised', ""'m"", 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'know', 'now', 'question', 'once', ""'ve"", 'screwed', 'up', 'what', 'do', 'do', 'then', 'Continue', 'affair', 'go', 'back', 'life', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'did', 'right', 'thing', 'ending', 'not', 'worth', 'throwing', 'marriage', 'away', 'just', 'gave', 'temptation.Glen', 'Close', 'character', 'made', 'men', 'cring', 'women', 'cheer', 'bunnies', 'run', 'hide', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'ignored', 'made', 'wonder', 'tendencies', 'women', 'be', 'jealous', 'how', 'pushed', 'limits', 'finally', 'culminating', 'violence', 'who', 'never', 'felt', 'want', 'need', 'man', 'may', 'cast', 'first', 'stone', 'are', 'working', 'thousands', 'years', 'social', 'conditioning', 'women', 'must', 'remind', 'own', 'worth', 'building', 'self', 'esteem', 'only', 'man', 'all.The', 'Special', 'edition', 'DVD', 'fantastic', 'up', 'insites', 'how', 'why', 'story', 'evolved', 'way', 'did', 'have', 'actors', 'look', 'back', 'how', 'moved', 'shaped', 'Glen', 'CLose', 'was', 'most', 'hated', 'woman', 'AMerica', 'while', 'Audiences', 'were', 'chanting', 'Kill', 'bitch', 'theaters', 'extent', 'changed', 'ending', 'time', 'when', 'screwballs', 'spoke', 'knew', 'what', 'were', 'talking', 'when', 'asked', 'different', 'ending', 'long', 'last', 'got', 'see', 'original', 'ending', 'where', 'Glen', 'Close', 'commits', 'suicide', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'taken', 'away', 'police', 'murder', 'Hurray', 'test', 'audience', 'made', 'right', 'decission', 'one', 'wanted', 'see', 'confrontation', 'wife', 'killed', 'bitch']",N/A

Because of this film, I will never have a one night stand...don't get me wrong, I would never cheat on a girlfriend/wife. One of my ex-girlfriends did stalk me for a while and I thought that was creepy...that was nothing compared to what occurs in this movie.Glenn Close and Michael Douglas are perfectly cast and everything about this thriller is so believable. Some people who commit infidelity catch STDs, but some will catch the equivalent of an STD...a full blooded maniac who will do ANYTHING to have what she wants. That is where the power of this movie comes from. Men who watch this film and sleep around will always be sure to call back the next morning. In the 80's, this movie had a huge impact because people were starting to become aware of STDs. The film itself -regardless of when it was released- packs a punch, a stab, a gunshot, and many other things. Without a doubt, this is one of my favorite thrillers ever made.To sum it all up: Dan (husband and father) sleeps with Alex (a desperate single woman at work) while Beth (Dan's wife) is away for the weekend, the woman realizes later on that Dan doesn not wish to continue the affair and FREAKS OUT stage-5 psycho.

241512,A1M9DQDGE07Q0U,6300988767,Nix Pix,"[3, 3]","This is the flick that had every executive in America rethinking his extramarital fling with the resident office floozy. One wonders what Dan Gallagher (Michael Douglas)was thinking when he traded in his loyal and sexy wife (Ann Archer) for freakishly unattractive and mentally twisted Alex Forrester (Glenn Close).  Clearly sex clouds the brain and robs it of all reasoning and judgment. By now everyone knows how it all comes out in the end.  Director Adrian Lyne interjected a great deal of cliche into the proceedings, not the least of which is the overwrought, over done ending. Glenn Close is so over the top it hurts (especially the rabbit) while Michael Douglas is pretty frenetic in his shift from moments of total aloofness buffeted by instances of sheer psycho rage.  Perhaps Dan and Alex weren't such a bad fit after all.Paramount has made ""Fatal Attraction"" available as a 'special edition' but don't be fooled.  The term 'special' is relative to executives at Paramount.  This disc looks terrible.  Colors are muddy, faded and, in some cases, bleed. Contrast levels are pathetically low.  The entire print is riddled with dirt, undistinguished black levels, fine detail shimmering and edge enhancement.  Whites register as a garish yellow and flesh tones are inconsistant, either orangy or pink.  Digital noise is detected throughout, though an over kill of the noise reduction equipment used in mastering this DVD has resulted in often soft, slightly out of focus images.  The audio has been remixed to 5.1 but don't let that fool you either.  The mix is virtually the same as the 2.0 version also included on the disc.  There are three featurettes presented, the best being ""Forever Fatal"" that is quite informative.  There's also some screen test footage and Adrian Lyne's original ending, that the studio was convinced would sink the movie - hence Lyne's re-editing with Close and Archer and that bathtub scene that continues to freak me out.Overall, Paramount really has nothing to brag about with this disc.  Yes it's anamorphic and widescreen but aside from that, there's precious little else to recommend the quality, or lack thereof, of the main feature.  And while I'm not a big fan of the movie, I can't deny that there was a great resonnence throughout the land of corporate America, during the greed-driven 80's, for every philanderer who suddenly found himself leaving the theater with his eyes wide open.",3,THE PSYCHO & THE SINNER: Infidelity On The Big Screen,1046995200,"03 7, 2003",2003,2433,"['flick', 'had', 'executive', 'America', 'rethinking', 'extramarital', 'fling', 'resident', 'office', 'floozy', 'One', 'Dan', 'Gallagher', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'was', 'thinking', 'when', 'traded', 'loyal', 'sexy', 'wife', 'Ann', 'Archer', 'freakishly', 'unattractive', 'mentally', 'twisted', 'Alex', 'Forrester', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'Clearly', 'sex', 'brain', 'robs', 'reasoning', 'judgment', 'now', 'everyone', 'how', 'out', 'end', 'Director', 'Adrian', 'Lyne', 'interjected', 'great', 'deal', 'cliche', 'proceedings', 'not', 'least', 'overwrought', 'done', 'ending', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'so', 'top', 'especially', 'rabbit', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'pretty', 'frenetic', 'shift', 'moments', 'total', 'aloofness', 'buffeted', 'instances', 'sheer', 'psycho', 'rage', 'Perhaps', 'Dan', 'Alex', 'were', ""n't"", 'such', 'bad', 'fit', 'all.Paramount', 'made', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'available', ""'special"", 'edition', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'term', ""'special"", 'relative', 'executives', 'Paramount', 'disc', 'terrible', 'Colors', 'are', 'muddy', 'faded', 'cases', 'bleed', 'Contrast', 'levels', 'are', 'pathetically', 'low', 'entire', 'print', 'riddled', 'dirt', 'undistinguished', 'black', 'levels', 'fine', 'detail', 'shimmering', 'edge', 'enhancement', 'register', 'garish', 'yellow', 'flesh', 'tones', 'are', 'inconsistant', 'either', 'orangy', 'pink', 'Digital', 'noise', 'detected', 'kill', 'noise', 'reduction', 'equipment', 'used', 'mastering', 'DVD', 'resulted', 'often', 'soft', 'slightly', 'focus', 'images', 'audio', 'been', 'remixed', '5.1', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'fool', 'either', 'mix', 'virtually', 'same', '2.0', 'version', 'also', 'included', 'disc', 'are', 'three', 'featurettes', 'presented', 'best', 'being', 'Forever', 'Fatal', 'quite', 'informative', 'also', 'screen', 'test', 'footage', 'Adrian', 'Lyne', 'original', 'ending', 'studio', 'was', 'convinced', 'would', 'sink', 'movie', 'hence', 'Lyne', 're-editing', 'Close', 'Archer', 'bathtub', 'scene', 'freak', 'out.Overall', 'Paramount', 'really', 'nothing', 'brag', 'disc', 'Yes', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'aside', 'precious', 'little', 'else', 'recommend', 'quality', 'lack', 'thereof', 'main', 'feature', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deny', 'was', 'great', 'resonnence', 'land', 'corporate', 'America', 'greed-driven', '80', 'philanderer', 'who', 'suddenly', 'found', 'leaving', 'theater', 'eyes', 'wide', 'open']",N/A

241523,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,6300988767,Robert Morris,"[4, 4]","Except for the final scene (which I suspect was ""borrowed"" from Henri-Georges Clouzot's Diabolique), this is a solid film. In it, Director Adrian Lyne examines the consequences of a one-night affair involving two very attractive people, Alex Forrest (Glenn Close) who is single and Dan Gallagher (Michael Douglas) who is married and a parent of young children. While Beth Gallagher (Anne Archer, also ""borrowed,"" from Jack Ryan) and the children are visiting her mother, Dan unexpectedly finds himself having drinks and then dinner with Alex. They feel an immediate and powerful sexual attraction to each other. Later, they spend the night in her loft apartment. Insofar as he's concerned, it was a memorable night, thanks ever so much, but that's it. Alex reacts differently, at first asking and then demanding that they continue the relationship. She even claims to be pregnant and at one point attempts suicide. Of course, all this is not what Dan had in mind but Alex forces him to recognize the significance of his adultery.The acting is consistently strong but the screenplay allows for almost no character development, nor are the nature and extent of Alex's psychological problems ever revealed or even explored. Obviously, she is lonely and delusional as well as envious of the lifestyle Beth and Dan share. Only an actor possessed of Glenn Close's talents and temperament could reveal (albeit only in brief moments) Alex's tenderness which helps to explain her vulnerability to both real and perceived grievances. After seeing the film again, I still think the final scene in the upstairs bathroom doesn't work. In fact, I think it detracts from the narrative development which precedes it. On balance, however, Fatal Attraction offers solid entertainment even as it raises (at least in my mind) questions about the two main characters and their relationship which, for whatever reasons, Lyne and/or his screenwriters do not address in the film.Hence my interest in the special features provided with the DVD version. They include a commentary by Lyne, ""Forever Fatal: Remembering `Fatal Attraction'"" (which offers new, exclusive cast and crew interviews), ""Social Attraction"" (an analysis of the cultural phenomenon of a fatal attraction), ""Visual Attraction"" (a behind-the-scenes production featurette), rehearsal footage, and the alternate ending  introduced by Lyne.",4,Almost,1064534400,"09 26, 2003",2003,2380,"['final', 'scene', 'suspect', 'was', 'borrowed', 'Henri-Georges', 'Clouzot', 'Diabolique', 'solid', 'film', 'Director', 'Adrian', 'Lyne', 'consequences', 'one-night', 'affair', 'involving', 'two', 'very', 'attractive', 'people', 'Alex', 'Forrest', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'who', 'single', 'Dan', 'Gallagher', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'who', 'married', 'parent', 'young', 'children', 'Beth', 'Gallagher', 'Anne', 'Archer', 'also', 'borrowed', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'children', 'are', 'visiting', 'mother', 'Dan', 'unexpectedly', 'having', 'drinks', 'then', 'dinner', 'Alex', 'feel', 'immediate', 'powerful', 'sexual', 'attraction', 'other', 'Later', 'spend', 'night', 'loft', 'apartment', 'Insofar', 'concerned', 'was', 'memorable', 'night', 'thanks', 'ever', 'so', 'much', 'Alex', 'differently', 'first', 'asking', 'then', 'demanding', 'continue', 'relationship', 'even', 'claims', 'be', 'pregnant', 'one', 'point', 'attempts', 'suicide', 'course', 'not', 'what', 'Dan', 'had', 'mind', 'Alex', 'recognize', 'significance', 'adultery.The', 'acting', 'consistently', 'strong', 'screenplay', 'almost', 'character', 'development', 'are', 'nature', 'extent', 'Alex', 'psychological', 'problems', 'ever', 'revealed', 'even', 'explored', 'Obviously', 'lonely', 'delusional', 'as', 'well', 'envious', 'lifestyle', 'Beth', 'Dan', 'share', 'Only', 'actor', 'possessed', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'talents', 'temperament', 'could', 'reveal', 'only', 'brief', 'moments', 'Alex', 'tenderness', 'explain', 'vulnerability', 'real', 'perceived', 'grievances', 'seeing', 'film', 'again', 'still', 'think', 'final', 'scene', 'upstairs', 'bathroom', ""n't"", 'work', 'fact', 'think', 'narrative', 'development', 'balance', 'however', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'solid', 'entertainment', 'even', 'least', 'mind', 'questions', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'relationship', 'reasons', 'Lyne', 'screenwriters', 'do', 'not', 'address', 'film.Hence', 'interest', 'special', 'features', 'provided', 'DVD', 'version', 'include', 'commentary', 'Lyne', 'Forever', 'Fatal', 'Remembering', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'new', 'exclusive', 'cast', 'crew', 'interviews', 'Social', 'Attraction', 'analysis', 'cultural', 'phenomenon', 'fatal', 'attraction', 'Visual', 'Attraction', 'behind-the-scenes', 'production', 'featurette', 'rehearsal', 'footage', 'alternate', 'ending', 'introduced', 'Lyne']",N/A

Smith ""bookworm""","[0, 0]","Since 1987, ""Fatal Attraction"" has been the gold standard for a truly terrifying thriller about relationships gone wrong.Dan (Michael Douglas) is a guy who seemingly has it all...a lovely wife (Anne Baxter) and a cute little girl who adores him.  But for Dan, life will never be the same when he encounters Alex Forrest (Glenn Close) at a party.We know that Alex spells trouble the minute she appears on screen.  Close plays the oddly seductive vixen with a reptilian, dead-eyed stare and wild blonde mane (it was the 80's, after all).  The story unfolds rather quickly, with each moment building to a chilling crescendo as we realize that Alex is one sick bunny...oops, I mean puppy.This seriously disturbed woman will not leave Dan alone and Michael Douglas plays this role to the hilt, barely concealing his tension and fear.  We see how easily he is lured into Alex's web of manipulation and evil.  We see his guilt as he tries to hide his infidelity from his wife.  ""Fatal Attraction"" is a study in the complexity of relationships and the dark side of humanity.Close literally becomes the epitome of evil in this role.  She is also a mystery as Alex Forrest, because viewers are left wondering who Alex really is.  Is she a sociopath or a lonely woman driven to madness?  How did her father die, and was this the catalyst for her trouble with men?  Why is she so fixated on Dan when there are millions of other men in New York City?I actually had a few moments of sympathy for her, although she is a loathsome character.  My skin crawled and my blood curdled, yet I could also see the sadness and desperation oozing from her in some scenes.  She would be convincing as a figment of Stephen King's twisted imagination...she is THAT scary.I would classify ""Fatal Attraction"" as a combination of suspense and horror, but it is more on the horror side for me.  Years later, no other actress can match the vengeance of a woman scorned the way it was depicted by Glenn Close.  She set the bar extremely high and I've yet to see anybody else do it that way again.  A few have tried to replicate ""Fatal Attraction"" in weak fashion, but it simply can't be done.Five stars all the way for this classic film!",5,"""I Will Not Be Ignored!""",1336003200,"05 3, 2012",2012,2202,"['1987', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'been', 'gold', 'standard', 'truly', 'terrifying', 'thriller', 'relationships', 'gone', 'wrong.Dan', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'guy', 'who', 'seemingly', 'lovely', 'wife', 'Anne', 'Baxter', 'cute', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'Dan', 'life', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'same', 'when', 'Alex', 'Forrest', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'party.We', 'know', 'Alex', 'trouble', 'minute', 'screen', 'Close', 'oddly', 'seductive', 'vixen', 'reptilian', 'dead-eyed', 'stare', 'wild', 'blonde', 'mane', 'was', '80', 'story', 'rather', 'quickly', 'moment', 'building', 'chilling', 'crescendo', 'realize', 'Alex', 'one', 'sick', 'bunny', 'mean', 'puppy.This', 'seriously', 'disturbed', 'woman', 'will', 'not', 'leave', 'Dan', 'alone', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'role', 'hilt', 'barely', 'concealing', 'tension', 'fear', 'see', 'how', 'easily', 'lured', 'Alex', 'web', 'manipulation', 'evil', 'see', 'guilt', 'hide', 'infidelity', 'wife', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'study', 'complexity', 'relationships', 'dark', 'side', 'humanity.Close', 'literally', 'epitome', 'evil', 'role', 'also', 'mystery', 'Alex', 'Forrest', 'viewers', 'are', 'left', 'wondering', 'who', 'Alex', 'really', 'sociopath', 'lonely', 'woman', 'driven', 'madness', 'How', 'did', 'father', 'die', 'was', 'catalyst', 'trouble', 'men', 'Why', 'so', 'fixated', 'Dan', 'when', 'are', 'millions', 'other', 'men', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'actually', 'had', 'few', 'moments', 'sympathy', 'loathsome', 'character', 'skin', 'crawled', 'blood', 'curdled', 'yet', 'could', 'also', 'see', 'sadness', 'desperation', 'oozing', 'scenes', 'would', 'be', 'convincing', 'figment', 'Stephen', 'King', 'twisted', 'imagination', 'scary.I', 'would', 'classify', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'combination', 'suspense', 'horror', 'more', 'horror', 'side', 'Years', 'later', 'other', 'actress', 'can', 'match', 'vengeance', 'woman', 'scorned', 'way', 'was', 'depicted', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'set', 'bar', 'extremely', 'high', ""'ve"", 'yet', 'see', 'anybody', 'else', 'do', 'way', 'again', 'A', 'few', 'have', 'tried', 'replicate', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'weak', 'fashion', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'done.Five', 'stars', 'way', 'classic', 'film']",N/A

Glenn Close plays Alex Forrest, a mentally unstable career woman who has a one night stand with Dan Gallagher, a successful husband and father. After two nights of extremely bizarre love making (kitchen sink, anyone?), Dan decides that it is time to call it off for good. Big mistake. Alex Forrester teaches him a lesson he'll never forget...this film is responsible for the term ""bunny boiler"", by the way. Soon, Dan's wife gets in on the fun, and it all leads up to that disturbing, overwrought - and terribly cliched - climax.One thing is for sure: you never know who to root for in this film. I go back and forth between Michael Douglas and Glenn Close. I can't decide. I mean, he's the jerk that cheated on his hot wife, knowing that he has a wife and a little girl at home. In a way, I think he deserves it. There are times when I smile with glee as he is forced to suffer the consequences to his actions - Mwahahahaha! But then I think, ""Geez, Glenn Close. You're one scary ho! Go on with your power hair, you demented skank! Leave that man alone! What did the rabbit do to you, you whore?! Glenn! Give me the knife! Stop cutting yourself, Glenn! Alright, Anne Archer. Blast her."" It's easy to switch allegiances with the characters in this film. That's part of the fun of FATAL ATTRACTION, if you can get past the hilarious love-making scenes, which include Michael Douglas constantly, OBSESSIVELY sucking on Glenn's saggy boobs every chance he gets! EVERY love scene, he goes straight for the boobs. That's all she is to him. Just one big boob to suck. Anyways, if you can get past THAT, then you'll have the time of your life. I wasn't kidding when I said it has camp value, but it is still disturbing as well, don't get me wrong. If I learned one thing by watching this film, it's that I will NEVER, EVER cheat on my wife. EVER. And that's a good thing. I'll bet you anything that this film has saved marriages. After this film, you know why THOU SHALT NOT COMMIT ADULTRY is one of the top 10.

I still recall when ""Fatal Attraction"" came out, way back in 1987; people kept talking about how good this film was, and audiences couldn't believe how a mistake could actually lead to murder. The plot is simple in that a man has an affair behind his wife's back with a woman who turns out to be a clear psychotic. Once the man refuses any more advances from his ""one-night stand"", she is determined to make his life, as well as that of his family's, a living hell. The timing of the movie couldn't have been better, as it was released during the first decade of the AIDS epidemic, when people realized that HIV was no longer a gay disease, and that straight people were actually dying from it. It was as if the producers were showing that screwing around could kill you. This movie actually worked;  more manogamous relationsips were reported by the late '80's, and the number of people that had extramarital affairs dropped. This movie even made the cover of ""Time"" magazine, a rare feat for a Hollywood film. Glenn Close also received an Oscar nomination as Best Actress, but lost to Cher.

Many married men have trysts without ever getting caught, but for those who aren't so lucky, the price tag is far greater than anything they could ever imagine.  Just ask Dan (Michael Douglas), a successful Manhattan lawyer who crosses paths with Alex (Glenn Close, who has this movie to thank for her career) and stupidly has an affair with her while his family is out of town.  On the surface, Alex seems like a perfect catch: she's smart, independent, professional, and reasonably attractive.  But just a few minutes into the film we learn that she's a total bizarro and holds on to Dan with the tenacity of a pit bull.  When his family returns to town, he tactfully tells her that the affair is over, but Alex ain't having any of it.  Like that car salesman you always hated, she won't take &quot;no&quot; for an answer.  &quot;I'm not going to be IGNORED,&quot; she says to Dan in a tone so acid it almost burns through the screen. Her instability, thanks to a creepy performance by Close, slowly escalates and paves the way for drama including stalking, late night phone calls, kidnapping, and a boiling pot of rabbit stew (don't ask, just watch the film).  Critics to this day still sniff at director Adrian Lyne for allegedly filming what they felt amounted to little more than a trashy, exploitative soap opera.  So what?  The film was believable (if predictable), had decent performances, and had me hooked to the screen.  If there's anything to nitpick at, it's the DVD released by Paramount.  Quite simply, the picture looks terrible.  The presentation looks washed out, the colors are blah, and we see print flaws (spots and scratches) throughout the film.  However, we do get some really cool features such as retrospective interviews and documentaries with a director's commentary.  Despite the disappointing quality of the picture, &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; is definitely worth a purchase.",4,&quot;I'm Not Going To Be IGNORED.&quot;,1061510400,"08 22, 2003",2003,2104,"['Released', 'quot', 'every-man-for-himself', 'quot', '1980s', 'quot', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'quot', 'was', 'more', 'box', 'office', 'hit', 'also', 'made', 'strong', 'overly', 'extreme', 'case', 'extramarital', 'affairs', 'Many', 'married', 'men', 'have', 'trysts', 'ever', 'getting', 'caught', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'so', 'lucky', 'price', 'tag', 'far', 'greater', 'anything', 'could', 'ever', 'imagine', 'Just', 'ask', 'Dan', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'successful', 'Manhattan', 'lawyer', 'who', 'paths', 'Alex', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'who', 'movie', 'thank', 'career', 'stupidly', 'affair', 'family', 'town', 'surface', 'Alex', 'perfect', 'catch', 'smart', 'independent', 'professional', 'reasonably', 'attractive', 'just', 'few', 'minutes', 'film', 'learn', 'total', 'bizarro', 'Dan', 'tenacity', 'pit', 'bull', 'When', 'family', 'returns', 'town', 'tactfully', 'affair', 'Alex', 'ai', ""n't"", 'having', 'car', 'salesman', 'always', 'hated', 'wo', ""n't"", 'take', 'quot', 'quot', 'answer', 'quot', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'be', 'IGNORED', 'quot', 'Dan', 'tone', 'so', 'almost', 'screen', 'instability', 'thanks', 'creepy', 'performance', 'Close', 'slowly', 'escalates', 'way', 'drama', 'including', 'stalking', 'late', 'night', 'phone', 'calls', 'kidnapping', 'boiling', 'pot', 'rabbit', 'stew', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'just', 'watch', 'film', 'Critics', 'day', 'still', 'director', 'Adrian', 'Lyne', 'allegedly', 'filming', 'what', 'felt', 'amounted', 'little', 'more', 'trashy', 'exploitative', 'soap', 'opera', 'what', 'film', 'was', 'believable', 'predictable', 'had', 'decent', 'performances', 'had', 'hooked', 'screen', 'anything', 'nitpick', 'DVD', 'released', 'Paramount', 'Quite', 'simply', 'picture', 'terrible', 'presentation', 'washed', 'out', 'colors', 'are', 'blah', 'see', 'print', 'flaws', 'spots', 'scratches', 'film', 'However', 'do', 'get', 'really', 'cool', 'features', 'such', 'retrospective', 'interviews', 'documentaries', 'director', 'commentary', 'disappointing', 'quality', 'picture', 'quot', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'quot', 'definitely', 'worth', 'purchase']",N/A
241548,A1LJR5IS0B6ADX,6300988767,"The Straw Man ""J.E. Hoppock""","[3, 3]","""Fatal Attraction"" has been a personal favorite of mine since I first saw it many years ago.  I just revisited the film last night after my friend stated that he had never seen it.  I told him that it was a travesty this film had never danced across his psyche, so I whipped it out of my collection and we watched away.  Once the motion picture ceased, I decided I needed to review it.This movie is so iconic for myriad reasons; I am not even sure where to start.  This 1987 film was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actress.  I still feel disenchanted that Glenn Close did not win for Best Actress; her performance was impeccable, uncannily holistic and down right insidious. I say this without malice towards Cher, who won the Oscar for Best Actress for ""Moonstruck"", which was also an amazing film and yes Cher was wonderful.  As a matter of fact, ""Fatal Attraction"" lost in all six categories, which is unfortunate.  Nevertheless, the Academy Awards are one part accreditation and one part popularity contest.""Fatal Attraction"" is about a New York Lawyer named Dan Gallagher (Michael Douglas), who has a weekend affair with Alex Forest (Glenn Close) when his wife (Anne Archer) and daughter are gone for the weekend. Dan views the affair as a fling and does his best to cut ties with Alex, but she is not having it and refuses to be ""ignored"".  Alex becomes obsessed with Dan and harasses him, stalks him and makes his life a living hell.There are some other minor elements to the film, but basically this is the meat and potatoes of the movie.  Honestly the story is rather simplistic, which could leave it open to being a rather dull film.  However the directing, editing, mood, acting and imagery make this movie one disturbing and malefic viewing experience.I want to address the imagery and/or symbolism present in this movie.  I never noticed until my viewing last night how much water played a part in this film.  From the multiple times it rained in the movie to scenes that revolved around the sink and the zenith of the film in the bathtub. I also like how the color white is depicted in this movie, the opposite of pure.  As for the acting well it is candid and gritty.  Douglas is basically your everyday man who made a very stupid choice.  I firmly believe that if ""Wall Street"" hadn't been released the same year Douglas would have been nominated for this movie.  I have already shared my thoughts on Close; she scared the hell out of me.  Actually, Archer was also nominated for Best Actress, so her performance is on point too.This DVD edition has a plethora of features included commentary, interviews with cast & crew and the original ending.  The original ending is very, very interesting and is the icing on the cake to this DVD.  The film is presented in letterbox/widescreen and the audio is nice and crisp, overall a great purchase.""Fatal Attraction"" has been criticized for being guilty of misogyny. Mainly due to the fact that the character of Alex is an independent and successful woman, yet is totally dependent on a shallow relationship and is psychotic.  I would say that the character of Alex Forest is a text book paradigm of borderline personality disorder.  Therefore, it would make her presentation more of a character study than an anti-feminist movement.  Not to mention this character isn't representing all women, just one.  As for Dan, he isn't guilt free, he made some poor decisions but I truly believe he pays for it with the outcomes of his choices.  As for the poor bunny...In conclusion, this is one of the few movies that really scared me.  Why one might ask?  Mainly because this can happen, there are women (and men) in the world who are deranged and have a skewed perception on life and relationships.  I for one have dated several women who have had some of Alex's traits.  ""Fatal Attraction"" in its purest form is a horror movie, plan and simple.

It is still suspenseful, still provocative and most importantly, still entertaining.Much of this comes from the fact that Adrian Lyne was the perfect director for this film about a lawyer (Michael Douglas) who has a regretful one-night stand when his wife is away for the weekend.  His directing is subtle, intimate and character-based (except for the Friday the 13th-type slasher ending which caters more to audience expectations rather than character motivations).All lead actors are well-cast, particularly the underrated Glenn Close as Alex, the troubled one-night stand who becomes increasingly psychotic.  Close plays Alex as a human, not simply a villain; a complex women with psychological problems and who is socially isolated.The DVD extras are excellent including the several insightful documentaries on the making of the film, but more interesting is the alternate ending.  It is easy to understand why the original ending was scrapped; it's dull and anti-climatic.  The reshot ending, aka &quot;the bathroom confrontation&quot; may be too violent and conventional, but it is more satisfying than the original ending.

241559,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,6300988767,Wuchak,"[1, 4]","""Fatal Attraction"" tells the story of a Manhattan attorney (Michael Douglas) who foolishly decides to have a weekend affair with a sharp blond (Glenn Close) while his wife (Anne Archer) & kid are away visiting the grandparents. The situation turns increasingly harrowing and horrifying when the woman refuses to end the union.The film was hugely popular when it was released in 1987, but I didn't see it until a decade later. I saw it again this week and I had forgotten how good it is.It's easy to compare to Clint Eastwood's ""Play Misty for Me"" (1971) since both films deal with a sexual affair gone bad and the clingy psycho woman, but other than the obvious similarities the stories, characters and locales are totally different. In other words, just because you've seen one doesn't mean you shouldn't see the other. Both are very good, even great, and worth your time if you're in the mood for such a flick. That said, however, if I were to compare the two unbiasedly I'd have to give the edge to ""Fatal,"" even though ""Misty"" has better locations (beautiful Carmel, California).Many question why Douglas would even consider cheating on a wife as beautiful as Archer, but the film clearly shows that Douglas was starting to get sexually frustrated (there's a scene where Douglas is looking foward to sex but his daughter ends up sleeping on the bed with his wife while he gets stuck on the couch). It's also clear that Douglas didn't plan to commit adultery; the opportunity presented itself while his wife was away and it simply didn't take much for him to fall into the temptation. I'm not defending his unfaithfulness, in fact I'm totally opposed to it, but at least his actions weren't premeditated.Others complain that Glenn Close isn't attractive in the film, but she looks pretty dang sharp to me. As the story progresses and we see how truly disturbed she is it's only natural to view her as ugly; in fact, she becomes absolutely hideous! Regardless, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.The drama and acting are outstanding here. As Close becomes increasingly irritating and clingy you can see Douglas's progressive horror on his face, as if he's saying, ""What did I get myself into? I'm so stupid! How can I get rid of her? -- AaaaaAAAAHH!""Some complain about Douglas breaking into Close's apartment and attacking her, but in light of her actions this is a very realistic and understandable reaction.Then there's the debate about who's the real villain -- Close or Douglas -- and that Close deserves at least a little compassion, especially on the grounds that Douglas' character views their sexual union as a mere physical encounter and Close as a throwaway object in which he can satisfy his lust and pride (of course, you could argue the same vice versa). On the contrary, Close is a real person who apparently sees their union as something deeper. Something not just physical, but emotional and spiritual as well. Is it any wonder that she starts to increasingly lose it after Douglas breaks off the fling? Not that I'm justifying her actions. I'm just pointing out how ""Fatal Attraction"" potently illustrates the possible consequences of treating people like throwaway sex objects. In the vast majority of cases, of course, the consequences aren't nearly as extreme, but there are always repercussions, even if it's just a broken or hardened heart. Try as we might, separating the physical from the spiritual is a lost cause. Nevertheless, the story makes it clear that Douglas ""made the bed he's sleeping in""; he certainly deserves to experience the consequences of his foolish actions, if for no other reason than to learn from his mistakes, but by the end of the film anyone who believes he (and his family) hasn't suffered enough is a sadist! As for compassion on Close's character: Yes, up to a point she deserves an ounce or two of human compassion (we all screw up and make wrong choices from time to time, don't we?), but only up to a point. After all, she walked into this fling fully knowing he was a married family man, not to mention she adamantly claimed to be discreet and insisted the same in him. Besides, it takes two to tango. Regardless, there is zero justification for her actions as the story progresses; she clearly earns the label of villain and Douglas the foolhardy victim.I do have a few cavils with the film: The phone plays too big of a role and gets bothersome after awhile. Plus, Douglas and his wife act too naively late in the story. The psycho woman is missing and has already broken into their house and kidnapped their kid from school. Shouldn't they be extremely on guard? Also, the 'kid' is actually a girl named Ellen, but throughout the film she looks like a boy named Allen. Go figure.Be sure to check out the original ending on the dvd. The original ending [SPOILER ALERT!] has Close committing suicide and getting back at Douglas as his fingerprints are on the knife and he gets arrested. But Douglas' wife finds a cassette with Close admitting that she was going to kill herself so he gets off the hook. [END SPOILER]. All the principle filmmakers, including Douglas, felt the original ending was ineffective and test audiences verified this; only Close and Archer defended it. Hence, eight months after completion they shot a different ending. Did they make the right choice? That's for you to decide, but I agree with the filmmakers that the deleted climax is rather flat whereas the newer ending is simply more entertaining. Less believable, perhaps, but more exciting and entertaining (but certainly not outside the realm of possibility, except for one horror cliche).Filmed on location in Manhattan and the New York

241561,A16Q1LYIDE2WDZ,6300988767,Zoe Paris,"[3, 4]","This movie is a classic! A story about a successful attorney Dan (Douglas)who should have known better than to have an affair with a sexy but psycotic Alex Forrest (Glen Close). Dan is a happily married guy with a beautiful wife and a daughter (the 'daughter' who totally looks, talks and dresses like a boy! This role could have been cast better in my opinion or they could have at least dressed the little girl like a GIRL to avoid confusion, especially since her hair is very short and her face rather ambiguous) and for some reason decides to have a fling while his wife is out of town. It's a little hard to see his motive for the affair, Alex is sexy and wild but not nearly as pretty as Dan's wife and Glen Close not only plays a good psycotic but she looks the part too. I think this movie should have had better character development and maybe a better motive for Dan cheating. As it is, it doesn't make a lot of sense that he would be perfectly happy and still cheat. There also is not a whole lot about Dan which gives the viewer sympathy for him. If anything Dan just comes off as a shallow jerk and he gets exactly what he deserves. Regardless you can really feel the chemistry between Close and Douglas as they share a steamy, sex filled weekend together. The affair quickly goes from a weekend between two adults to a full blown obsession as Close falls madly 'in love' with Douglas. Alex attempts suicide, calls non-stop, shows up at Dan's work, threatens to tell his wife, claims she's pregnant, mutilates and boils his daughter's bunny and makes Dan's life hell all the while claiming to be in love with him. You can't really feel sorry for Dan because he did a really dumb thing, especially considering he should know the law but you feel sorry for his wife and kid. Dan clearly plays the fool as he falls for Alex's charms and fails to get to know her or set healthy boundries. There are hints that Alex is not what she seems, she's clingy, unstable, manipulative and over analyzes his every word. A man who's thinking with his brain would not be fooled by her act but Dan is clearly thinking with something else and pays the terrible price. The movie is a little dated and unrealistic but other than that it's a great story with good suspense, awesome acting, great surprises and a very valuable lesson.",4,The moral of the story...Don't cheat on your wife with psycho chicks!,1168819200,"01 15, 2007",2007,2324,"['movie', 'classic', 'story', 'successful', 'attorney', 'Dan', 'Douglas', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'better', 'have', 'affair', 'sexy', 'psycotic', 'Alex', 'Forrest', 'Glen', 'Close', 'Dan', 'happily', 'married', 'guy', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'daughter', ""'daughter"", 'who', 'totally', 'talks', 'dresses', 'boy', 'role', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cast', 'better', 'opinion', 'could', 'have', 'least', 'dressed', 'little', 'girl', 'GIRL', 'avoid', 'confusion', 'especially', 'hair', 'very', 'short', 'face', 'rather', 'ambiguous', 'reason', 'decides', 'have', 'fling', 'wife', 'town', 'little', 'hard', 'see', 'motive', 'affair', 'Alex', 'sexy', 'wild', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'pretty', 'Dan', 'wife', 'Glen', 'Close', 'not', 'only', 'good', 'psycotic', 'part', 'too', 'think', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'better', 'character', 'development', 'maybe', 'better', 'motive', 'Dan', 'cheating', ""n't"", 'make', 'lot', 'sense', 'would', 'be', 'perfectly', 'happy', 'still', 'cheat', 'also', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'Dan', 'viewer', 'sympathy', 'anything', 'Dan', 'just', 'off', 'shallow', 'jerk', 'exactly', 'what', 'Regardless', 'can', 'really', 'feel', 'chemistry', 'Close', 'Douglas', 'share', 'steamy', 'sex', 'filled', 'weekend', 'together', 'affair', 'quickly', 'weekend', 'two', 'adults', 'full', 'blown', 'obsession', 'Close', 'madly', ""'in"", 'love', 'Douglas', 'Alex', 'attempts', 'suicide', 'non-stop', 'up', 'Dan', 'work', 'tell', 'wife', 'pregnant', 'mutilates', 'boils', 'daughter', 'bunny', 'Dan', 'life', 'hell', 'while', 'claiming', 'be', 'love', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'feel', 'sorry', 'Dan', 'did', 'really', 'dumb', 'thing', 'especially', 'considering', 'should', 'know', 'law', 'feel', 'sorry', 'wife', 'kid', 'Dan', 'clearly', 'fool', 'Alex', 'charms', 'fails', 'get', 'know', 'set', 'healthy', 'boundries', 'are', 'hints', 'Alex', 'not', 'what', 'clingy', 'unstable', 'manipulative', 'word', 'man', 'who', 'thinking', 'brain', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'fooled', 'act', 'Dan', 'clearly', 'thinking', 'something', 'else', 'terrible', 'price', 'movie', 'little', 'dated', 'unrealistic', 'other', 'great', 'story', 'good', 'suspense', 'awesome', 'acting', 'great', 'surprises', 'very', 'valuable', 'lesson']",N/A
