The character of prem is typical rich kid but he was unexpectadly sweet and kind to Suman right from the start. RIght from the start the chemistry between the two is great.  THe way there friendship grows into love is super sweet as well. I especially loved the songs, the only downside is they are not subtitled, but you don't feel like your missing much because they act out a lot of what the song is about. Watching prem fight to prove his love in the second half is what we expect and anticipate as we watch these wonderfully over the top films!

One has left his poor roots (partly due to his old friend) and become wealthy. The poorer one has a daughter and the wealthier one a son. Poorer Dad has to go oversees for work for 6 months and reconnects with old friend so that daughter can stay safely there in his absence. Of course daughter and son fall in love. Wealthy Dad won't approve a wedding because of the status difference. There is also a shady 'friend' of wealthy Dad plotting so his daughter can marry the son and he can get his hands on the wealth. Will the love birds succeed in their marriage...? (Actually there's also an actual 'love bird': a carrier pigeon who becomes a player in events and even a hero at the end!)This is dated a bit as it is 1989. But if you can overlook the 80s fashion and hairdos (and th4e posters of Michael Jackson and Bruce Springsteen on the boy's wall!), the story is a good Bollywood melodrama romance. I don't relate to the music of the period and there is a lot of it (including a couple of songs that went on and on). The 'heart' in the movie built in the second half and I even managed a few tears!However the acting is mostly good. The girl is fine but didn't particularly stand out for me (but then I'm female too and tend to notice the males more!). However Salman Khan is excellent (never thought I'd write that!). It is interesting to look back to this, his second movie and first really big starring role and see what people saw in him. I can find him a bit mixed- good at times but not relating when he does 'comedy' in the hammy way the Indians seem to like. But here he is innocent, sincere, gorgeous, a good actor and dancer- a great teen romantic hero. He won 2 awards for this movie at the time (and the film itself also won an award.If you like Bollywood romances and don't mind the age of this it is worth a visit. Elsewhere on the Net it rates above average mostly (e.g. 7-8 out of 10). That's where I'd put it too.

1208594,AOUFNKPTMAIHO,B001KQF9TU,vent,"[0, 0]","Suitable for family. Very old fashioned with some pleasant songs. If your a lover of old style American films and have just fallen in love with old and new Bollywood like I have , you will love this one. The only silliness is being a little overdone on the action scenes at the end and all the American action movies are just as guilty of that flaw everyday of the week. It's much harder to do low tech stunts than high tech ones so after I stopped laughing (I laughed at Arnold Swarzenegger's high tech stunts too ) I thought about how much harder it must be. AFTER I stopped laughing. It's still just too cute a movie to pass up. The violence is very cartoonish with ring of thugs pouncing on the hero and punches occasional kick to the groin etc so shouldn't bother very young ones unless they're really sensitive. The pigeon never gets hurt I swear.The story is very good and the dancing and songs are like a true musical and move the plot forward or contribute scenes of life. Good Mix of Laughter vs Tears ratio .Good use of LOCAL talent for a change, not a bunch of half dressed skanky looking Bar flies. Very sweet young girl role , meets very handsome honest young man while staying at his parents house. Easy plot line to follow for anyone over 7 or so . She falls in love with Salman and then gets picked on by local rich evil snobs who are trying to control his father. The son gets engaged via his mom one afternoon when his mom realizes how much the young couple loves each other. Problem , the  son is told by his father that night he's to marry the evil girl who's brother tried to attack his love. His dad's choice stinks, that whole nasty family is cartoon evil.  When Salman refuses evil chick, he is disowned and thrown out. He has to works hard manual labor in a rock quarry near his loves home after HER dad points out that he has no way to support a wife now that he has left his family. Sheer working mans revenge. Enjoy that part all you want.( picture the Donald in a rock quarry..too tempting... You know you want to. It's human ). He proves himself over and over and almost get's killed a few times but in the end of course the lovers reunite after they're stubborn fathers make up and go back to being financially unequal but happy friends.There is a very good overall moral tale;  love of family and friends is more important than money and honest work is needed to earn anything of value . Just try not to judge the ending to harshly for the silliness factor. I just let reality go out the window and have a good laugh and or cry . The kids will love it..subtitles are a great way to practice your reading...sneaky but true.",4,Maine Pyar Kiya ---sweet corn.,1333929600,"04 9, 2012",2012,2655,"['Suitable', 'family', 'Very', 'old', 'fashioned', 'pleasant', 'songs', 'lover', 'old', 'style', 'American', 'films', 'have', 'just', 'fallen', 'love', 'old', 'new', 'Bollywood', 'have', 'will', 'love', 'one', 'only', 'silliness', 'being', 'little', 'overdone', 'action', 'scenes', 'end', 'American', 'action', 'movies', 'are', 'just', 'guilty', 'flaw', 'everyday', 'week', 'much', 'harder', 'do', 'low', 'tech', 'stunts', 'high', 'tech', 'ones', 'so', 'stopped', 'laughing', 'laughed', 'Arnold', 'Swarzenegger', 'high', 'tech', 'stunts', 'too', 'thought', 'how', 'much', 'harder', 'must', 'be', 'AFTER', 'stopped', 'laughing', 'still', 'just', 'too', 'cute', 'movie', 'pass', 'up', 'violence', 'very', 'cartoonish', 'ring', 'thugs', 'pouncing', 'hero', 'punches', 'occasional', 'kick', 'groin', 'etc', 'so', 'should', ""n't"", 'bother', 'very', 'young', 'ones', ""'re"", 'really', 'sensitive', 'pigeon', 'never', 'hurt', 'swear.The', 'story', 'very', 'good', 'dancing', 'songs', 'are', 'true', 'musical', 'move', 'plot', 'forward', 'contribute', 'scenes', 'life', 'Good', 'Mix', 'Laughter', 'vs', 'Tears', 'ratio', '.Good', 'use', 'LOCAL', 'talent', 'change', 'not', 'bunch', 'half', 'dressed', 'skanky', 'looking', 'Bar', 'flies', 'Very', 'sweet', 'young', 'girl', 'role', 'very', 'handsome', 'honest', 'young', 'man', 'staying', 'parents', 'house', 'Easy', 'plot', 'line', 'follow', 'anyone', '7', 'so', 'love', 'Salman', 'then', 'picked', 'local', 'rich', 'evil', 'snobs', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'control', 'father', 'son', 'engaged', 'mom', 'one', 'afternoon', 'when', 'mom', 'how', 'much', 'young', 'couple', 'loves', 'other', 'Problem', 'son', 'told', 'father', 'night', 'marry', 'evil', 'girl', 'who', 'brother', 'tried', 'attack', 'love', 'dad', 'choice', 'stinks', 'whole', 'nasty', 'family', 'cartoon', 'evil', 'When', 'Salman', 'evil', 'chick', 'disowned', 'thrown', 'out', 'works', 'hard', 'manual', 'labor', 'rock', 'quarry', 'loves', 'home', 'HER', 'dad', 'points', 'out', 'way', 'support', 'wife', 'now', 'left', 'family', 'Sheer', 'working', 'mans', 'revenge', 'Enjoy', 'part', 'want', 'Donald', 'rock', 'quarry..too', 'tempting', 'know', 'want', 'human', 'almost', 'get', 'killed', 'few', 'times', 'end', 'course', 'lovers', 'reunite', ""'re"", 'stubborn', 'fathers', 'make', 'up', 'go', 'back', 'being', 'financially', 'unequal', 'happy', 'friends.There', 'very', 'good', 'overall', 'moral', 'tale', 'love', 'family', 'friends', 'more', 'important', 'money', 'honest', 'work', 'needed', 'earn', 'anything', 'value', 'Just', 'try', 'not', 'judge', 'ending', 'harshly', 'silliness', 'factor', 'just', 'let', 'reality', 'go', 'out', 'window', 'have', 'good', 'laugh', 'cry', 'kids', 'will', 'love', 'it..subtitles', 'are', 'great', 'way', 'practice', 'reading', 'sneaky', 'true']",Maine Pyar Kiya
