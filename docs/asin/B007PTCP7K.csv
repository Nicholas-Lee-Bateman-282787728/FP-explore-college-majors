1535823,A14XW8BJGEBM91,B007PTCP7K,Carlos E. Velasquez,"[2, 3]","Starz is kicking some serious butt --yes, sir. With the successful series ""Spartacus"" and ""Boss,"" this maverick entertainment company now releases the equally awesome ""Magic City,"" a classy, yet brutal look at the Miami of the late fifties.We get hooked right away with the James-Bondish-beginning, when we see this woman swimming under water totally naked, with the background of a spicy, tropical soundtrack. We are then taken to the majestic Miramar Playa Hotel, in Miami Beach, during the early hours of December 31, 1958. We meet the powerful hotel boss, Isaac ""Ike"" Evans (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), who is being pressured to unionize, a costly move, for he is not ready for its economical impact.  The union is led by Mike Strauss (Leland Orser), who will not reconsider stopping the union from picketing the hotel at the new years' gala event, where Frank Sinatra is scheduled to perform. Ike tries to convince Mike, to no avail, that by picketing at such an important hour, he will ruin him - he spent a lot of money for this event. Regrettably, Mike tells him that the ""union attack when it hurts"" Ike, unfortunately, is against the wall and have to seek help fast - very fast --, and he contacts Ben Diamond (Danny Huston), also known as ""The Butcher,"" the local crime boss. The solution, of course, is to make Mike ""disappear,"" which is what eventually happens. As it turns out, it was a quick fix for a difficult situation for Mike, who likes to run his hotel in an almost  clean way - ""occasionally bending the letter of the law,"" as he says --, and is a descent man. However, when you make business with the Butcher, there are consequences that follow, and that, precisely, is what ""Magic City"" is all about: the blowback from that single favor. Hence, in the ten episodes of the first season, we'll have a lot murders, politics, congressional lobbying, gambling, prostitution, backstabbing, Cuban refugees, Santeria, boxing, nudity (male and female), all of which will test Ike's character. We will also learn a lot about his family, beginning with his beautiful, loyal and smart wife Vera (ex-bond girl Olga Lurylenko); his sons Stevie (Steven Strait), his dad's right hand, Danny, an aspiring lawyer (Christian Cooke), and his almost teenager daughter Lauren (Taylor Blackwell); his friend Victor Lazaro, (Yul V&aacute;zquez) the hotel's manager, and his daughter Mercedes Lazaro (Dominik Garcia-Lorido; yes, Andy Garcia's daughter); and his father Arthur Evans (Alex Rocco, ""the worst Jew in town,"" as he calls himself) But the character that is Ike's nemesis (in addition to The Butcher) is District Attorney Jack Klein (Matt Ross), who wants to send Ike to jail, telling him, ""Ike, you are between a rock and a hard place: the State of Florida and Ben Diamond... If I don't get you, The Butcher will.""  So, as you can see, Ike has a pretty full plate.""Magic City,"" like the city that it tries to portray, has class and elegance in everything - the sex, the ambiance, the colors, the nudity... hell, even the violence. It has style and it has substance - great production design and photography --, and it feels like noir at times. The cast is superb, and it also includes Kelly Lynch, Jessica Marais, Elena Satine, and Michael Rispoli. Can't wait for the next season! The DVD version includes Starz studios for Magic City, the Cars and the Style of Magic City, The Golden Age of Music, and more.

1535835,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B007PTCP7K,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[13, 17]","On the surface, the Starz original drama ""Magic City"" would seem to have everything. It's not hard to imagine the pitch when creating this adult oriented mob drama: Let's combine the period detail that works so well in ""Mad Men"" with the gritty gangster vibe that made ""The Sopranos"" such a success. I'd like to say that I made up these comparisons, but both were used in the aggressive advertising campaign that Starz used to launch the show (so clearly it's a side-by-side that they are comfortable with). But that's part of the problem. Instead of crafting a unique product to wow the audience, ""Magic City"" is covering some pretty familiar territory with its central themes. The primary plot points are so similar to dozens of other mob related stories that it's almost impossible not to make comparisons. Don't get me wrong, there are tons of great elements within ""Magic City"" and I think it has the potential (should it return) to develop into something quite grand. As of Season One, though, it is a show that is still finding its way dramatically.The story of ""Magic City"" takes place in Miami Beach circa 1959. Ike Evans (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), a visionary hotelier, has just opened the exclusive Miramar Hotel. It's a tumultuous time. Evans is combating an underworld business partner (a great Danny Huston), fending off inquiries from the District Attorney's office, dealing with a crisis in Cuba, opposing unionization, and dealing with a family that all share responsibilities within the resort. It's a great environment for drama. Add that the hotel features talent such as Sinatra (not shown) and hosts gala events for Jackie Kennedy (not shown), and it's an incredible world mixing fact with fiction. There are dozens of characters battling for screen presence, though, within these eight episodes of Season One and the balance can sometimes be out of proportion.The Good:Technical Production: Without a doubt, the real star of ""Magic City"" are its production values. The sets, costume design, cinematography, and musical score rival anything on TV today. The show is absolutely gorgeous!Danny Huston: Over-the-top and chewing every bit of scenery, when Huston hits the screen--the pulse of the show raises a few notches. As the primary villain, the program is well served by the gleefully unpleasant Huston.Has Potential:Cast: I really like the primary cast led by Jeffrey Dean Morgan. Steven Strait as his eldest son carries one of the more interesting story threads with Jessica Marais (as Huston's wife). I also liked Elena Satine as a working girl who gets in over her head as well as supporting turns by Kelly Lynch, Alex Rocco, Matt Ross and Michael Rispoli.Family Life: The show still hasn't fit Evans' new wife in as effectively as I'd like and moments of domesticity can be either great or momentum draining, still finding a balance.The Not-so-Good:Cuban Storyline: Evans' business assistant/employee Yul Vasquez has a wife he's trying to get out of the country, but as he'd never been developed--I found this storyline rather flat.Young Love: Evans' youngest son (Christian Cooke) is involved with Vasquez's daughter. The story grinds to a halt when the two are together. The young lady in question is the one member of the cast that truly stands out in a negative light with painful and inflectionless line readings. Seriously, she recalls the wooden Sofia Coppola from Godfather III.I liked ""Magic City,"" I just haven't felt a passion for it yet. I would definitely tune in for a second season if that's an option. It has all the potential in the world, it just needs to refine its storytelling and its characterizations.

1535844,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B007PTCP7K,Mark Turner,"[9, 10]","Once more cable TV sets out to make a series that hopes to deliver high class drama with low class subject matter. It's something they've come to do well for the most part but not always as effectively as they'd like. This time around the series revolves around the Miami hotel circuit near the end of the fifties and into the sixties, displaying the desire of Hollywood execs to try and capitalize off the success of other shows once more. Once MAD MEN took off and became a hit, suddenly everyone wanted to revisit the early 60s. The network series about Hugh Hefner and the Playboy Empire floundered shortly after it aired and PAN AM didn't even make it through the first season. So how does MAGIC CITY stand?The story revolves around Ike Evans (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), a man who struggled from the bottom to get to the top. The owner and main driving force behind the Miramar Hotel on the famous beach does whatever he can to make his business succeed. Unfortunately that includes becoming involved with the mob in the form of boss Ben Diamond (Danny Huston).The time is ripe for mob influence as well with Castro coming into power in Cuba and their hotels/casinos there being lost. They not only want to be involved in the hotels in Miami, they want to take ownership of them from behind the scenes. It's the only way they can with the FBI looking over their shoulder.Ike sees the potential that the hotels in Miami have. He sees it as more than a simple place to rest yourself on the road to somewhere. This is a resort town in the making with the potential of casinos and high class entertainment much like Vegas which was developing at the same time. But he has problems that he thinks only these mob connections can solve, the first of which is a potential union strike by the hotel employees. With Frank Sinatra set to open on his stage, he can't afford to have them picketing out front. The mob solution of course ends in someone being killed and the body dumped. This plays into several episodes down the line and links Ike into the dealings behind the scenes as well as in front.The story also involves Ike's sons, one of whom unknowingly begins a rather heated affair with Ben's wife and the other going to college to become involved with law enforcement. Either one has the potential of collapsing the dreams of Ike.The show does capture the feel and the look of the times. It offers a glittery surface that most people who went their saw without the darker roots at its core. It's those darker roots that develop most of the drama in the show and that keep it interesting.The acting is well played by all involved. Morgan has become a driving force in the roles he plays. I first saw him in the series SUPERNATURAL and wondered why he wasn't used more. Since then he's had several starring roles and with his turn here as Ike shows that he deserves more. Huston plays the slimy mob boss to perfection. Ruled more by temperamental fits than by sly cunning, Huston's Ben is to be feared first and foremost. He can be outmaneuvered but only if you don't forget that behind that temper is a cunning sense of evil that just might discover more than you want.While the show is well made and thought out it didn't feel to me that it would be one that would last several seasons and yet season two is already in the works. It will be interesting to see how it plays out. The one thing that did bother me while watching was the reliance on nudity that all cable shows seem to feel the need to resort to. It's as if they feel the only way to let people know that the show is a cable show is to display nude women every so many minutes per episode. While the women on view are lovely isn't there a better use for them in a series than window dressing? I'm sure those who made the series would argue that women at that time in this arena were used for nothing more. For myself I've just grown tired of the same thing being dumped into cable series as nothing more than a way of saying ""See? We're a cable series. We have breasts and networks don't. Watch us instead."" It doesn't encourage me to watch. The story should be what matters and the focus of the show as well. The so called ""window dressing"" doesn't get me interested.That being said there is potential in this show. If they can focus on the important aspects of it and move past the rest then it might be something worth watching. If it continues down this path then it is nothing more that a celebration of T&A; with some story thrown in for good measure.",3,MIAMI AND THE MOB,1352764800,"11 13, 2012",2012,4519,"['Once', 'more', 'cable', 'TV', 'sets', 'out', 'make', 'series', 'deliver', 'high', 'class', 'drama', 'low', 'class', 'subject', 'matter', 'something', ""'ve"", 'come', 'do', 'well', 'most', 'part', 'not', 'always', 'as', 'effectively', ""'d"", 'like', 'time', 'series', 'Miami', 'hotel', 'circuit', 'end', 'fifties', 'sixties', 'displaying', 'desire', 'Hollywood', 'execs', 'try', 'capitalize', 'off', 'success', 'other', 'shows', 'once', 'more', 'Once', 'MAD', 'MEN', 'took', 'off', 'became', 'hit', 'suddenly', 'everyone', 'wanted', 'revisit', 'early', '60s', 'network', 'series', 'Hugh', 'Hefner', 'Playboy', 'Empire', 'floundered', 'shortly', 'aired', 'PAN', 'AM', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'make', 'first', 'season', 'how', 'MAGIC', 'CITY', 'stand', 'story', 'Ike', 'Evans', 'Jeffrey', 'Dean', 'Morgan', 'man', 'who', 'struggled', 'bottom', 'get', 'top', 'owner', 'main', 'driving', 'force', 'Miramar', 'Hotel', 'famous', 'beach', 'can', 'make', 'business', 'succeed', 'Unfortunately', 'becoming', 'involved', 'mob', 'form', 'boss', 'Ben', 'Diamond', 'Danny', 'Huston', '.The', 'time', 'ripe', 'mob', 'influence', 'as', 'well', 'Castro', 'coming', 'power', 'Cuba', 'hotels/casinos', 'being', 'lost', 'not', 'only', 'want', 'be', 'involved', 'hotels', 'Miami', 'want', 'take', 'ownership', 'scenes', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'FBI', 'looking', 'over', 'shoulder.Ike', 'potential', 'hotels', 'Miami', 'have', 'more', 'simple', 'place', 'rest', 'road', 'somewhere', 'resort', 'town', 'making', 'potential', 'casinos', 'high', 'class', 'entertainment', 'much', 'Vegas', 'was', 'developing', 'same', 'time', 'problems', 'only', 'mob', 'connections', 'can', 'solve', 'first', 'potential', 'union', 'strike', 'hotel', 'employees', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'set', 'open', 'stage', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'have', 'picketing', 'out', 'front', 'mob', 'solution', 'course', 'ends', 'someone', 'being', 'killed', 'body', 'dumped', 'several', 'episodes', 'down', 'line', 'links', 'Ike', 'dealings', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'front.The', 'story', 'also', 'Ike', 'sons', 'one', 'whom', 'unknowingly', 'rather', 'heated', 'affair', 'Ben', 'wife', 'other', 'going', 'college', 'become', 'involved', 'law', 'enforcement', 'one', 'potential', 'collapsing', 'dreams', 'Ike.The', 'show', 'capture', 'feel', 'look', 'times', 'glittery', 'surface', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'went', 'saw', 'darker', 'core', 'darker', 'roots', 'develop', 'most', 'drama', 'show', 'keep', 'interesting.The', 'acting', 'well', 'played', 'involved', 'Morgan', 'become', 'driving', 'force', 'roles', 'first', 'saw', 'series', 'SUPERNATURAL', 'wondered', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'used', 'more', 'then', 'had', 'several', 'starring', 'roles', 'turn', 'here', 'Ike', 'more', 'Huston', 'slimy', 'mob', 'boss', 'perfection', 'Ruled', 'more', 'temperamental', 'fits', 'sly', 'cunning', 'Huston', 'Ben', 'be', 'feared', 'first', 'foremost', 'can', 'be', 'outmaneuvered', 'only', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'temper', 'cunning', 'sense', 'evil', 'just', 'might', 'discover', 'more', 'want.While', 'show', 'well', 'made', 'thought', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'would', 'last', 'several', 'seasons', 'yet', 'season', 'two', 'already', 'works', 'will', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'out', 'one', 'thing', 'did', 'bother', 'watching', 'was', 'reliance', 'nudity', 'cable', 'shows', 'seem', 'feel', 'need', 'resort', 'feel', 'only', 'way', 'let', 'people', 'know', 'show', 'cable', 'show', 'display', 'nude', 'women', 'so', 'many', 'minutes', 'episode', 'women', 'view', 'are', 'lovely', ""n't"", 'better', 'use', 'series', 'window', 'dressing', ""'m"", 'sure', 'who', 'made', 'series', 'would', 'argue', 'women', 'time', 'arena', 'were', 'used', 'nothing', 'more', ""'ve"", 'just', 'grown', 'tired', 'same', 'thing', 'being', 'dumped', 'cable', 'series', 'nothing', 'more', 'way', 'saying', 'See', ""'re"", 'cable', 'series', 'have', 'breasts', 'networks', 'do', ""n't"", 'Watch', 'instead', ""n't"", 'encourage', 'watch', 'story', 'should', 'be', 'what', 'matters', 'focus', 'show', 'as', 'well', 'so', 'called', 'window', 'dressing', ""n't"", 'get', 'being', 'said', 'potential', 'show', 'can', 'focus', 'important', 'aspects', 'move', 'rest', 'then', 'might', 'be', 'something', 'worth', 'watching', 'down', 'path', 'then', 'nothing', 'more', 'celebration', 'T', 'A', 'story', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure']",N/A

Talk about late 50's, early 60's glamor, suspense and drama, this one has it all, right in Miami Beach, and it gets better with each episode. Music is superb and so are the sets. It takes you right back in time. I wish there were less blatant, raw sexual scenes. Too much, and leaves nothing to the imagination, which is where I like to be. ( and I do love sex and romance, just not so much as in this show. Way over the top, in my opinion )The only other negative I have about the show, is the main actor, Jeffery Dean Morgan who plays Ike, the main man that owns the faboo hotel on the beach. He needs to have more verve, dynamics and excitement, as his older son possesses,and whom I love to watch. The younger son, really should have been another actor, if they needed him at all, in my opinion.The girls are plentiful, and beautiful and sexy and so are the cars of that era. Can't wait until the second season. Hope Morgan comes back with more of a masculine touch, however. You know, raw, and unafraid....not so passive, as he was in the first season. The rest of the guys are hot though, especially my favorite, The Butcher, who is Danny Houston, son of John Houston and half-sister to Angelica Houston. This guy can ACT!!! And the writers have really done an A+ job of casting and writing him. He makes the show, in my opinion. :)",4,My Kind of Show,1352419200,"11 9, 2012",2012,1417,"['liked', 'Mad', 'Men', 'Damages', 'Revenge', 'Sopranos', 'show', 'Talk', 'late', '50', 'early', '60', 'glamor', 'suspense', 'drama', 'one', 'right', 'Miami', 'Beach', 'better', 'episode', 'Music', 'superb', 'so', 'are', 'sets', 'right', 'back', 'time', 'wish', 'were', 'less', 'blatant', 'raw', 'sexual', 'scenes', 'Too', 'much', 'nothing', 'imagination', 'where', 'like', 'be', 'do', 'love', 'sex', 'romance', 'just', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'show', 'Way', 'top', 'opinion', 'only', 'other', 'negative', 'have', 'show', 'main', 'actor', 'Jeffery', 'Dean', 'Morgan', 'who', 'Ike', 'main', 'man', 'faboo', 'hotel', 'beach', 'have', 'more', 'verve', 'dynamics', 'excitement', 'older', 'son', 'possesses', 'whom', 'love', 'watch', 'younger', 'son', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'actor', 'needed', 'opinion.The', 'girls', 'are', 'plentiful', 'beautiful', 'sexy', 'so', 'are', 'cars', 'era', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'second', 'season', 'Hope', 'Morgan', 'back', 'more', 'masculine', 'touch', 'however', 'know', 'raw', 'unafraid', 'so', 'passive', 'was', 'first', 'season', 'rest', 'guys', 'are', 'hot', 'especially', 'favorite', 'Butcher', 'who', 'Danny', 'Houston', 'son', 'John', 'Houston', 'half-sister', 'Angelica', 'Houston', 'guy', 'can', 'ACT', 'writers', 'have', 'really', 'done', 'A+', 'job', 'casting', 'writing', 'show', 'opinion']",N/A

I won't waste time with a recap of the story since it's listed above these reviews. What I will say is that I JUST found out about this show in 2014 and started watching the Blu-ray sets last week. If you love the fashions of Mad Men, the violence of The Sopranos and some of the most decadent and luxurious sets ever featured on television, Magic City is your show. This show is pure eye candy and every episode looks VERY expensive. It's a shame Starz didn't make any real effort to promote and save this show. This is the kind of series that slowly builds an audience from word of mouth and rentals to become the next Breaking Bad (which was a sleeper hit for the first few seasons as well). I wish I was writing this review in 2016 talking about how great season 5 was but Starz pulled the plug already. To sum it up, if you enjoy seeing beautiful people, amazing sets, fantastic cars, shocking violence, nudity, boozing, breathtaking sunsets and a really cool chapter in American history, buy these dvd's. Maybe if they sell enough copies the show could be picked up again (this happened with Family Guy, Futureama & Arrested Development).",4,"You've never heard of the fantastic cable series, Magic City?
