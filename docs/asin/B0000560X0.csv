If we start from this statement I can tell you that for me, the concert was good, just good. The band BEHIND Benson is cold and the don't really play with joy and soul. There are few good moments of playing (the piano section with Joe sample and when Benson makes a bagpipe sound with the guitar) but all is ruined when a group of middle-age women start to do some dirty dancing... come on!!! one of them climbed up to dance with an uncomfortable George (just look at his face when she tries to do a sexual dance with him). She even tries to catch the mic from George's hand. This can't happen in a professional performance.

568565,A1VQ4V2I0VIJA4,B0000560X0,"""songlife""","[9, 11]","This is a project that should have been done when GB was in top form, conquering the world: the 70's. Unfortunately, it wasn't, resulting in nil 70's video output and this too-late show from 2000. It's not bad at all, and often very enjoyable, but if you're old enough to remember how this guy used to absolutely tear up the stage with his guitar pyrotechnics and incredibly soulful, soaring voice, this show might disappoint you. Age and a lot of touring/singing has taken its toll on his voice, but not to an intolerable degree. He tends to scream or slur off tough notes instead of hitting them melodiously like he used to, and his voice is raspy and harsh occasionally. He's had these tendencies as far back as the 80's though. The parts that are hardest to deal with are those on which he attempts to scat without his guitar - he just can't do it very well anymore. He needs the guitar in unison with his voice to keep him from getting silly. GB does have a quirky sense of humor, and you'll see it in this show (particularly when an older woman hops onstage and dances with him - his look of alarm is priceless!), but it doesn't serve him well when singing or scatting - it's at these moments when he seems to be just parodying himself.For this show, he was trying very hard to please, and it shows. He sometimes tries to do a little more vocally than he's capable of, but he can still do ANYTHING he wants to on guitar. The highlight in this respect is &quot;Danny Boy&quot;, a solo instrumental in which he emulates the sound of bagpipes on guitar. It's an amazing, virtuoso performance, reminiscent of his early days. When GB has a guitar in his hands, he's still a very dangerous man. But he spends half of the show guitar-free, as usual, which is mystifying considering his obsession with pleasing people.The biggest downer with the first half of show are the bland, lifeless arrangements and GB's need to get warmed up. The BBC Orchestra plays without any big band fire at all. I was really disappointed for a while; the songs seemed very slow in comparison to the album versions, and everyone seemed to be just going through the motions - zero inspiration. &quot;Beyond The Sea&quot;, for example, was pathetic, with GB's lousy vocal and the band playing as if they were in molasses. GB just doesn't work as a lead singer for a big band - he doesn't have the vocal firepower anymore. Then Joe Sample comes out for a few passionless songs from &quot;Absolute Benson&quot;. Those tunes (except for The Ghetto, which is good) are reminiscent of his &quot;Collaboration&quot; album; weak, aimless melodies in the Earl Klugh fashion, with the obligatory, bland solo spots. Same overproduced junk he's been doing since the 80's. Up to this point, halfway through, with the weak performances and frequent, weird costume changes (why does he feel the need to wear a hot, snazzy suit all the time?), it looked like hope was lost.However, GB finally turned up the heat by returning to his glory days: &quot;This Masquerade&quot;, &quot;Breezin&quot; (with a great arrangement that he obviously likes to improvise to), and many of his other hits are marvelously performed. This is where the crowd gets really pumped up and comes alive, as do GB, the band, and the viewer. He sings these songs more passionately than the rest. Again, when he picks up his guitar (and stops the silly dancing and mugging), his inspiration level increases and the music sometimes catches fire. Although, I wish he'd have gotten the old group back together for this gig: Ronnie Foster, Ralph MacDonald, Harvey Mason, Phil Upchurch. With those guys, he could actually improvise, instead of just being the &quot;star of the show&quot; and playing the hits with a generic backing group. His group was a major key to his greatest music, and the guys playing with him at this show are okay, but seem afraid to do anything but play the chord changes. These isn't much interaction between them and GB. At least the great Stanley Banks is still with him.The DVD quality is fine. The 5.1 sound is excellent and a blast to hear, although I thought the keyboards were mixed too low. George is WAY out front, but has sound great. The picture is good, high res, but a widescreen format for something like this puzzles me.I think it's safe to say GB's most creative musical days, and best singing, are behind him. But it's okay; people get older. His guitar skills are unaffected. This DVD is a good show, but sort of like hearing Sinatra in his later years. He's not what he used to be, and it takes a hell of a lot of effort to get back to (or near) that level on a song-per-song basis. I think GB can do better, but this is what was released, so I'll take what I'm given.",3,"It's no Weekend In LA, but does provide some soulful moments",981590400,"02 8, 2001",2001,4741,"['project', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'when', 'GB', 'was', 'top', 'form', 'conquering', 'world', '70', 'Unfortunately', 'was', ""n't"", 'resulting', 'nil', '70', 'video', 'output', 'too-late', 'show', '2000', 'not', 'bad', 'often', 'very', 'enjoyable', ""'re"", 'old', 'enough', 'remember', 'how', 'guy', 'used', 'absolutely', 'tear', 'up', 'stage', 'guitar', 'pyrotechnics', 'incredibly', 'soulful', 'soaring', 'voice', 'show', 'might', 'disappoint', 'Age', 'lot', 'touring/singing', 'taken', 'toll', 'voice', 'not', 'intolerable', 'degree', 'scream', 'slur', 'off', 'tough', 'notes', 'instead', 'hitting', 'melodiously', 'used', 'voice', 'raspy', 'harsh', 'occasionally', 'had', 'tendencies', 'far', 'back', '80', 'though', 'parts', 'are', 'hardest', 'deal', 'are', 'scat', 'guitar', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'very', 'well', 'anymore', 'guitar', 'unison', 'voice', 'keep', 'getting', 'silly', 'GB', 'have', 'quirky', 'sense', 'humor', ""'ll"", 'see', 'show', 'particularly', 'when', 'older', 'woman', 'onstage', 'dances', 'look', 'alarm', 'priceless', ""n't"", 'serve', 'well', 'when', 'singing', 'scatting', 'moments', 'when', 'be', 'just', 'parodying', 'himself.For', 'show', 'was', 'trying', 'very', 'hard', 'please', 'sometimes', 'do', 'little', 'more', 'vocally', 'capable', 'can', 'still', 'do', 'ANYTHING', 'guitar', 'highlight', 'respect', 'quot', 'Danny', 'Boy', 'quot', 'solo', 'instrumental', 'sound', 'bagpipes', 'guitar', 'amazing', 'virtuoso', 'performance', 'reminiscent', 'early', 'days', 'When', 'GB', 'guitar', 'hands', 'still', 'very', 'dangerous', 'man', 'half', 'show', 'guitar-free', 'usual', 'mystifying', 'considering', 'obsession', 'pleasing', 'people.The', 'biggest', 'downer', 'first', 'half', 'show', 'are', 'bland', 'lifeless', 'arrangements', 'GB', 'need', 'get', 'warmed', 'up', 'BBC', 'Orchestra', 'plays', 'big', 'band', 'fire', 'was', 'really', 'disappointed', 'while', 'songs', 'seemed', 'very', 'slow', 'comparison', 'album', 'versions', 'everyone', 'seemed', 'be', 'just', 'going', 'motions', 'zero', 'inspiration', 'quot', 'Beyond', 'Sea', 'quot', 'example', 'was', 'pathetic', 'GB', 'lousy', 'vocal', 'band', 'playing', 'were', 'molasses', 'GB', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'lead', 'singer', 'big', 'band', ""n't"", 'have', 'vocal', 'firepower', 'anymore', 'Then', 'Joe', 'Sample', 'out', 'few', 'passionless', 'songs', 'quot', 'Absolute', 'Benson', 'quot', 'tunes', 'Ghetto', 'good', 'are', 'reminiscent', 'quot', 'Collaboration', 'quot', 'weak', 'aimless', 'melodies', 'Earl', 'Klugh', 'fashion', 'obligatory', 'bland', 'solo', 'spots', 'Same', 'overproduced', 'junk', 'been', 'doing', '80', 'Up', 'point', 'halfway', 'weak', 'performances', 'frequent', 'weird', 'costume', 'changes', 'why', 'feel', 'need', 'wear', 'hot', 'snazzy', 'suit', 'time', 'looked', 'hope', 'was', 'lost.However', 'GB', 'finally', 'turned', 'up', 'heat', 'returning', 'glory', 'days', 'quot', 'Masquerade', 'quot', 'quot', 'Breezin', 'quot', 'great', 'arrangement', 'obviously', 'improvise', 'many', 'other', 'hits', 'are', 'marvelously', 'performed', 'where', 'crowd', 'really', 'pumped', 'up', 'alive', 'do', 'GB', 'band', 'viewer', 'songs', 'more', 'passionately', 'rest', 'Again', 'when', 'up', 'guitar', 'silly', 'dancing', 'mugging', 'inspiration', 'level', 'increases', 'music', 'sometimes', 'fire', 'wish', ""'d"", 'have', 'gotten', 'old', 'group', 'back', 'together', 'gig', 'Ronnie', 'Foster', 'Ralph', 'MacDonald', 'Harvey', 'Mason', 'Phil', 'Upchurch', 'guys', 'could', 'actually', 'improvise', 'instead', 'just', 'being', 'quot', 'star', 'show', 'quot', 'playing', 'hits', 'generic', 'backing', 'group', 'group', 'was', 'major', 'key', 'greatest', 'music', 'guys', 'playing', 'show', 'are', 'okay', 'seem', 'afraid', 'do', 'anything', 'play', 'chord', 'changes', ""n't"", 'much', 'interaction', 'GB', 'least', 'great', 'Stanley', 'Banks', 'still', 'him.The', 'DVD', 'quality', 'fine', '5.1', 'sound', 'excellent', 'blast', 'hear', 'thought', 'keyboards', 'were', 'mixed', 'too', 'low', 'George', 'WAY', 'front', 'sound', 'great', 'picture', 'good', 'high', 'res', 'widescreen', 'format', 'something', 'me.I', 'think', 'safe', 'say', 'GB', 'most', 'creative', 'musical', 'days', 'best', 'singing', 'are', 'okay', 'people', 'get', 'older', 'guitar', 'skills', 'are', 'unaffected', 'DVD', 'good', 'show', 'sort', 'hearing', 'Sinatra', 'later', 'years', 'not', 'what', 'used', 'be', 'hell', 'lot', 'effort', 'get', 'back', 'level', 'song-per-song', 'basis', 'think', 'GB', 'can', 'do', 'better', 'was', 'released', ""'ll"", 'take', 'what', ""'m"", 'given']",N/A

Simply stunning, turn up as loud as you can.DVD SUMMARY:  The DVD I have boasts both a DTS soundtrack and a 5.1 mix.  Most times I would pick the DTS soundtrack on a music DVD, but on this occassion, the 5.1 mix has a more natural sound to it.  If you have a surround sound system, choose this mix over the DTS. An earlier DVD release features a 2.0 mix which is ideal for people with only two speakers.A wonderful DVD that should be in your collection.  Its only letdowns are that the playlist is rather short, and the amount of overweight ladies in the crowd (as mentioned in other reviews).",4,I was breathless ...,1087344000,"06 16, 2004",2004,851,"['George', 'Benson', 'absolute', 'legend', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'see', '2000', 'concert', 'not', 'hits', 'are', 'covered', 'ones', 'love', 'are', 'Nothing', 'can', 'prepare', 'performances', 'quot', 'Masquerade', 'quot', 'quot', 'Breezin', 'quot', 'Simply', 'stunning', 'turn', 'up', 'as', 'loud', 'can.DVD', 'SUMMARY', 'DVD', 'have', 'boasts', 'DTS', 'soundtrack', '5.1', 'mix', 'Most', 'times', 'would', 'pick', 'DTS', 'soundtrack', 'music', 'DVD', 'occassion', '5.1', 'mix', 'more', 'natural', 'sound', 'have', 'surround', 'sound', 'system', 'choose', 'mix', 'DTS', 'earlier', 'DVD', 'release', '2.0', 'mix', 'ideal', 'people', 'only', 'two', 'speakers.A', 'wonderful', 'DVD', 'should', 'be', 'collection', 'only', 'letdowns', 'are', 'playlist', 'rather', 'short', 'amount', 'overweight', 'ladies', 'crowd', 'mentioned', 'other', 'reviews']",N/A
