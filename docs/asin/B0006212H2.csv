855828,A3AOKQCH0YBZDS,B0006212H2,L. A. Vitale,"[1, 1]","A very well done documentary that is thoroughly engaging and relevant to our times. Judith Helfand does a great job in her research of vinyl production and how bad it is for ones health and the environment. I think it is great that she tells us why she decided to do research on vinyl.Vinyl is very pervasive and is used in construction, medical products, packaging material, toys, automotive and electronic products. In watching ""Blue Vinyl"", one learns that making vinyl (or polyvinyl chloride short for pvc) is hazardous to produce, as vinyl chloride, has been known to cause various forms of cancer. Plus when destroyed through burning, vinyl emits a toxic gas called dioxin into the environment, which isn't healthy to breathe.",5,Dioxin & Vinyl Chloride Are Bad For Your Health & The Environment,1210204800,"05 8, 2008",2008,732,"['very', 'well', 'done', 'documentary', 'thoroughly', 'engaging', 'relevant', 'times', 'Judith', 'Helfand', 'great', 'job', 'research', 'vinyl', 'production', 'how', 'bad', 'ones', 'health', 'environment', 'think', 'great', 'why', 'decided', 'do', 'research', 'vinyl.Vinyl', 'very', 'pervasive', 'used', 'construction', 'medical', 'products', 'packaging', 'material', 'toys', 'automotive', 'electronic', 'products', 'watching', 'Blue', 'Vinyl', 'one', 'making', 'vinyl', 'polyvinyl', 'chloride', 'short', 'pvc', 'hazardous', 'produce', 'vinyl', 'chloride', 'been', 'known', 'cause', 'various', 'forms', 'cancer', 'when', 'destroyed', 'burning', 'vinyl', 'toxic', 'gas', 'called', 'dioxin', 'environment', ""n't"", 'healthy', 'breathe']",N/A
855829,A1HOLE9R6WPT85,B0006212H2,Mad Max,"[15, 15]","In this movie, Judith Helfand searches for the truth behind the vinyl industry.Questioning her parents decision to put blue vinyl siding on their house, she sets out to find the truth about vinyl: what are the hazards, are there side-effects, are there dangers in the production and disposal of vinyl?The result is entertaining, informative, and disturbing. I knew, from my work in the environmental field, that exposure to vinyl chloride is an extremely underrated hazard. Research has shown for years (and Helfand makes a strong case for this in her movie) that vinyl chloride is a carcinogen, and that the production & disposal of vinyl is a serious environmental and health risk.But one new area of concern, which was not addressed by the film, is that regular (so-called ""inert"") vinyl, found in PVC pipes, vinyl siding, shower curtains, car dashboards, etc., emits small doses of toxic chemicals, which also pose serious concerns.The film walks you through her process of learning about the industry, talking to victims and various experts, going to trade shows, and her many discussions with her (very patient) parents on this subject.Fun. Informative. Thought-provoking. What else can you ask for in a movie? I applaud the filmmaker - we need more movies like this one.",5,Great documentary,1137542400,"01 18, 2006",2006,1277,"['movie', 'Judith', 'Helfand', 'searches', 'truth', 'vinyl', 'industry.Questioning', 'parents', 'decision', 'put', 'blue', 'vinyl', 'siding', 'house', 'out', 'find', 'truth', 'vinyl', 'are', 'hazards', 'are', 'there', 'side-effects', 'are', 'dangers', 'production', 'disposal', 'vinyl', 'result', 'entertaining', 'informative', 'disturbing', 'knew', 'work', 'environmental', 'field', 'exposure', 'vinyl', 'chloride', 'extremely', 'underrated', 'hazard', 'Research', 'shown', 'years', 'Helfand', 'strong', 'case', 'movie', 'vinyl', 'chloride', 'carcinogen', 'production', 'disposal', 'vinyl', 'serious', 'environmental', 'health', 'risk.But', 'one', 'new', 'area', 'concern', 'was', 'not', 'addressed', 'film', 'regular', 'so-called', 'inert', 'vinyl', 'found', 'PVC', 'pipes', 'vinyl', 'siding', 'shower', 'curtains', 'car', 'dashboards', 'etc.', 'small', 'doses', 'toxic', 'chemicals', 'also', 'pose', 'serious', 'concerns.The', 'film', 'walks', 'process', 'learning', 'industry', 'talking', 'victims', 'various', 'experts', 'going', 'trade', 'shows', 'many', 'discussions', 'very', 'patient', 'parents', 'subject.Fun', 'Informative', 'Thought-provoking', 'What', 'else', 'can', 'ask', 'movie', 'applaud', 'filmmaker', 'need', 'more', 'movies', 'one']",N/A
