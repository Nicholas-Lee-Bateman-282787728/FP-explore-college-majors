I didn't find it bad, just very, very different.  For one, it is much, much darker.  Most of the characters seem on a collision course with self destruction.Vinnie Chase takes crazy risks, like embracing sky diving. He dates a porn star and gets more serious over her than any other woman but wants to ""cure"" her from being a porn star!  Drugs also lure him as they've never been able to do before.  Turtle is fronting a tequila business which is owned by some very shady Mexicans. Ari amplifies his abrasive personality into the stratosphere which starts fallout in all parts of his life.  Ironically, Billy, the failed, psychotic director from ""Medellin"" reenters the scene, having cleaned up his act.  Billy is now squeaky clean and focused! He and Drama, along with E, begin the evolution of Drama into a anime character, like Homer Simpson, which actually might be a smash hit.  Lloyd has a very minor role this season and that is too bad.If this show continues in its final season in this same vein, only a few characters may end this show intact and not be destroyed in some fashion, perhaps Drama and E.

All the swagger of Hollywood big shots like Ari Gold and Vinnie Chase proves to be too much for both the audience and their careers. Ari's big mouth finally gets him in trouble both in the industry and with his wife. Vinnie Chase suffers a similar fate as he falls in with the wrong crowd as his friends expand their own interests leaving Vinnie a bit too much time on his hands. All this would be good television if not for the incessant recycling of situations, especially in the case of Ari Gold, whose potty-mouth often goes too far, abandoning funny for grossly over the top. Drama gets and loses a series. E patches up with Sloan, albeit in a meandering way. Turtle struggles to find his own footing in a subplot that brings in some odd bedfellows for his new deal. Adding a bit of gravitas and sanity is the unlikely return of director Billy Walsh, who should have been given a much bigger role given his past with the show and his character's potential to show contrast and contrition, something the rest of the characters often lack. The show rides on it's foundation laid in the past few seasons where things were better in terms of story and execution, but this season really slips.

1330381,AX53DA3FTILL0,B0038M2ALO,Gene Siskel,"[1, 1]","As many people have stated, the seventh season of entourage is not funny.  There's some jokes scattered about, but primarily, it deals with Vince's downward spiral.  The core element of the show has been removed from this season (the unity of the boys). That is necessary for the story, it's the only way that Vince's addiction can reach the depths that it does.  All his friends are too caught up in their own lives to realize what is happening with Vince.  This results in multiple story lines, not of which are good.  E isn't really given much to do besides run around and get nothing done.  E's storyline was flat. Vince's storyline was interesting as he starts acting more aggressively and more obnoxious, while being saddled with a former porn actress (who serves as an enabler to Vince).  It was something fresh, but we've already seen Vince hit on hard times (season five). I guess the writers felt to have him sink a notch lower.Watching this season makes it apparent what a moron Turtle is, not particulary bright, but that deficiency is cancelled out by his good luck.  Turtle says and does stupid things the entire season (including being in the house with Vince while he is spiraling out of control and not noticing). This is why Turtle was relegated to being a driver, the writers made an error in trying to expand a disposable character like Turtle (the awful Jaime-Lynn Sigler storyline.ugh) Drama remains the comic relief of the show as he hopes to land a sitcom with John Stamos (funny stuff).  Most of the laughs from this season come from Drama.  Ari is given a good story line (unfortunately devoid of humor) where he is being threatened with a law suit for his slurs in the office by a former employee.  This shows an interesting dynamic of Ari, up until this point his work and family had remained separate(work never affected his family and vice versa), in this season, they collide.  This results in the best acting Jeremy Piven has done in this series. Unfortunately, and unwisely, Lloyd has been reduced to a background character, resulting in the loss of a great chemistry between Ari and Lloyd.This season of Entourage is really a dramatic season it is well done, but I want the good vibes and high energy of season six.

1330384,A12B7UDRANKDXA,B0038M2ALO,H. Narayanan,"[20, 26]","Entourage has lost the fun that made the show so watchable in its early run and the show is just not that great at pulling off dramatic moments. The character of Sasha Grey brought nothing to the show and the other guest stars were very little fun. The show has gone overboard with celebrity cameos and athlete cameos. The main plot of this season is that Vince is now an adrenaline junkie who has gone off the rails - this fails for several reasons. Vince has for the past six years been a laid back guy and now he is intense? Also no disrespect to Adrien Grenier but he cannot act that well and with his character being more central this season that is more apparent. Turtle is a black hole and his misery is hard to swallow considering how fortunate and lucky he is. The only positives of this season was that it was a great showcase for Jeremy Piven to show off his chops; the stuff with Ari being exposed as a crude and abusive guy makes no sense considering that it was almost a given that thats what his character is known for. To Piven's credit he sells it well and it somewhat believable. Entourage has reached the point that some other shows (Weeds comes to mind) where the show is no longer fun and no longer great.

It's been the funny story of how four guys from Queens with a small amount of guile and virtually no talent have come close to taming Tinseltown.Past seasons have been summertime bliss. It's been the equivalent of the afterglow you feel leaving a beach-party in a sweet convertible with the rag-top down and the stereo thumping knowing you have crazy stories to tell your friends in the morning.This season is a sharp departure from all of that. Everything is the inverse of what it was in seasons' past.The movie star, Vincent Chase, has always been like the (former) planet Pluto. He's loopy, sort of remote and meandering in a different direction than other celebrities in his orbit. His aloofness is what has made him charming, cool and fun - (perhaps because he's the refreshing opposite of the preening divas celebrities normally tend to be.)But when he emerges from a life-threatening situation in the season's first episode, the Vincent Chase we see is one driven by a cold fury. And this fury takes the entire season into an extremely odd and unexpected direction.Everyone is affected by this moodswing.Johnny Drama, who was slowly mounting a comeback before some unfortunate (self-inflicted) mishaps, appears to have completely given up on his dreams. We as viewers have never been privy to Drama when he was not animated by his dual quests for career redemption and to finally be taken seriously as an actor. (What is the B-actor to do when he can no longer find his motivation?)Nor have we seen Turtle (previously such an unmotivated hanger-on that he could barely get out of bed each morning) so desperate to succeed.  His newly-found motivation is so jarring that you want to say ""Imposter, who are you and what have you done with Turtle?""Eric finds himself suddenly paired with an evil doppelganger played by Scott Caan.  It's eerie.  If Eric was a foolish, chauvinistic, unscrupulous lout who was successful, he would be Ari Gold. If he had the same bad qualities and wasn't successful, he would be Scott. The dynamic between Eric and Scott is fascinating.Ari remains Ari. Over the years, he's grown rich and powerful while alienating nearly everyone.  The proverbial bull in the china shop. His enemies finally decide to gore this bull. What happens to him at the end of this season is surprising but makes perfect sense.In conclusion, the writers of Entourage tried something different this season. It almost as if we've stepped into a Bizarro universe this time around. It undoubtedly is the most polarizing of the Entourage seasons thus far. I found the writers' effort entertaining and admirable. But, with its extremely dark undertones, this season's not for everyone.",4,The Bizarro Season,1284336000,"09 13, 2010",2010,2807,"['Caveat', 'Emptor', 'Buyer', 'beware', 'majority', 'series', 'life', 'bread', 'butter', 'been', 'Hollywood', 'satire', 'been', 'funny', 'story', 'how', 'four', 'guys', 'Queens', 'small', 'amount', 'guile', 'virtually', 'talent', 'have', 'come', 'close', 'taming', 'Tinseltown.Past', 'seasons', 'have', 'been', 'summertime', 'bliss', 'been', 'equivalent', 'afterglow', 'feel', 'leaving', 'beach-party', 'sweet', 'convertible', 'rag-top', 'down', 'stereo', 'thumping', 'knowing', 'have', 'crazy', 'stories', 'tell', 'friends', 'morning.This', 'season', 'sharp', 'departure', 'Everything', 'inverse', 'what', 'was', 'seasons', 'past.The', 'movie', 'star', 'Vincent', 'Chase', 'always', 'been', 'former', 'planet', 'Pluto', 'loopy', 'sort', 'remote', 'meandering', 'different', 'direction', 'other', 'celebrities', 'orbit', 'aloofness', 'what', 'made', 'charming', 'cool', 'fun', 'perhaps', 'refreshing', 'opposite', 'preening', 'divas', 'celebrities', 'normally', 'tend', 'be', 'when', 'life-threatening', 'situation', 'season', 'first', 'episode', 'Vincent', 'Chase', 'see', 'one', 'driven', 'cold', 'fury', 'fury', 'entire', 'season', 'extremely', 'odd', 'unexpected', 'direction.Everyone', 'affected', 'moodswing.Johnny', 'Drama', 'who', 'was', 'slowly', 'mounting', 'comeback', 'unfortunate', 'self-inflicted', 'mishaps', 'have', 'completely', 'given', 'up', 'dreams', 'viewers', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'privy', 'Drama', 'when', 'was', 'not', 'animated', 'dual', 'quests', 'career', 'redemption', 'finally', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'actor', 'What', 'B-actor', 'do', 'when', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'find', 'motivation', 'have', 'seen', 'Turtle', 'previously', 'unmotivated', 'hanger-on', 'could', 'barely', 'get', 'bed', 'morning', 'so', 'desperate', 'succeed', 'newly-found', 'motivation', 'so', 'jarring', 'want', 'say', 'Imposter', 'who', 'are', 'what', 'have', 'done', 'Turtle', 'Eric', 'suddenly', 'paired', 'evil', 'doppelganger', 'played', 'Scott', 'Caan', 'eerie', 'Eric', 'was', 'foolish', 'chauvinistic', 'unscrupulous', 'lout', 'who', 'was', 'successful', 'would', 'be', 'Ari', 'Gold', 'had', 'same', 'bad', 'qualities', 'was', ""n't"", 'successful', 'would', 'be', 'Scott', 'dynamic', 'Eric', 'Scott', 'fascinating.Ari', 'remains', 'Ari', 'years', 'grown', 'rich', 'powerful', 'alienating', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'proverbial', 'bull', 'china', 'shop', 'enemies', 'finally', 'decide', 'gore', 'bull', 'What', 'end', 'season', 'surprising', 'perfect', 'sense.In', 'conclusion', 'writers', 'Entourage', 'tried', 'something', 'different', 'season', 'almost', ""'ve"", 'stepped', 'Bizarro', 'universe', 'time', 'around', 'undoubtedly', 'most', 'polarizing', 'Entourage', 'seasons', 'thus', 'far', 'found', 'writers', 'effort', 'entertaining', 'admirable', 'extremely', 'dark', 'undertones', 'season', 'not', 'everyone']",N/A

1330389,A3DHDS5HDFE6IX,B0038M2ALO,kerouac's ghost,"[19, 25]","Talk about not knowing what you're all about.Let's face it, ""Entourage"" (well, previous to this season) is candy.  You go there to enjoy some light satire, but mostly to watch a group of young guys hang out in Hollywood, lead the high life and chase chicks.  ""Entourage"" has been a great diversion...till now.  It seems the actors want to be AC-TORS.  Well, that's probably unfair. I doubt the actors have much say in the show's direction.This season handsome, funloving, reasonably humble Vince has taken a turn toward James Dean (which is not really accurate; as far as I know Dean was not a coke head and did not date porn stars).  He's deep this year.  Gone to the dark side.  Turtle, newly buff, is now an entrepreneur, albeit a bad one.  Eric is an engaged bore.  Drama...finally...is still consistent Drama.  I suppose dufuses are the easiest characters to write for.Worst of all, the character of Ari is embroiled in constant turmoil (and not the funny kind). In many ways, this character is the mover and shaker of this series.  Jeremy Piven's great comedic skills are completely wasted this season.  It appears the powers-that-be would rather see him red eyed and mooning over his hysterical wife than popping off wisecracks and KEEPING THE SHOW MOVING.  Of all the bad decisions the series producers have made, wasting Piven's talent on soap opera stories is the biggest screw up. The guys running this show would have had Groucho Marx playing Hamlet...badly.More bad news.  The character of Lloyd, excellently played by Rex Lee, is all but gone from the series. What is the rational behind that?  Stupidity?There were some good moves that, because of the overall flatness of the season, did not work out.  It was great to bring back the Billy Walsh character, who, unfortunately, is not the Billy Walsh character at all.  He is reformed....and damn dull.  The idea of having Drama's career ascending, while Vince struggles is a good one.  However, that idea is done-in by deciding to get a nuclear bomb to blow up Vince's career.  It would have been much more interesting - and more important, funnier - to have Vince simply struggling (bad career decisions, etc.) while Drama falls ass-backwards into success.The core of the show, formulaic though it may be, was all these young guys, with lots of money, laughing, drinking and standing in amazement at their good fortune when the credits role.  The ""entourage"" is no longer an entourage at all.  Let me say that again...the entourage is no longer an entourage at all. You have all of these little subplots pulling each character into their own world (and hence, scenes).We watched two episodes and my wife turned to me and said, ""Why did they ruin this show?""  We used to be all over the new episodes as soon as they aired.  Now, we see them when we think about it.  In fact, episode 10 (I think) has been available since Sunday and we still haven't seen it.  We'll get to it when we get to it and if this trend continues into the next season, we'll likely just leave it behind.  We don't watch ""Entourage"" in order to explore the darkness in men's souls.  We watch it to be entertained.  It's really just cotton candy.  That probably does not appeal to the artistes who fancy themselves as Billy Wilder or Orson Welles, but that's the way it is; and if they don't get back in touch with that vibe, this show is done.Miscellaneous notes:1)Why would the idgits running this show not use every excuse possible to get the unbelievably beautiful (and talented) Debi Mazar into every possible scene?  Here's an idea.  Write out Sloan and give Mazar every scene left vacant.2)Is it just me or has Hollywood turned (in a clever way, they probably think) against women?  It seems I am continuously seeing these hysterical unreasonable female characters (i.e. Ari's wife and her sister).  From ""Knocked Up"" up to Carmelo Soprano (who married a mobster and is simply disgusted by the fact that he does bad things).  Hollywood women - RISE UP!  Entourage producers - WISE UP!3)Someone will have to explain to me the big deal about Sasha Grey, the porn star turned would-be legit actress.  She is not particularly good looking and stiffness, though of great value in her day job, is not particularly appealing when it comes to acting.",1,"I don't watch ""Entourage"" in order to explore the darkness in men's souls....",1284508800,"09 15, 2010",2010,4286,"['Talk', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', ""'re"", 'about.Let', 'face', 'Entourage', 'well', 'previous', 'season', 'candy', 'go', 'there', 'enjoy', 'light', 'satire', 'mostly', 'watch', 'group', 'young', 'guys', 'hang', 'out', 'Hollywood', 'lead', 'high', 'life', 'chase', 'chicks', 'Entourage', 'been', 'great', 'diversion', 'till', 'now', 'actors', 'want', 'be', 'AC-TORS', 'Well', 'probably', 'unfair', 'doubt', 'actors', 'have', 'much', 'say', 'show', 'direction.This', 'season', 'handsome', 'funloving', 'reasonably', 'humble', 'Vince', 'taken', 'turn', 'James', 'Dean', 'not', 'really', 'accurate', 'as', 'far', 'know', 'Dean', 'was', 'not', 'coke', 'head', 'did', 'not', 'date', 'porn', 'stars', 'deep', 'year', 'Gone', 'dark', 'side', 'Turtle', 'newly', 'buff', 'now', 'entrepreneur', 'bad', 'one', 'Eric', 'engaged', 'bore', 'Drama', 'finally', 'still', 'consistent', 'Drama', 'suppose', 'dufuses', 'are', 'easiest', 'characters', 'write', 'for.Worst', 'character', 'Ari', 'embroiled', 'constant', 'turmoil', 'not', 'funny', 'kind', 'many', 'ways', 'character', 'mover', 'shaker', 'series', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'great', 'comedic', 'skills', 'are', 'completely', 'wasted', 'season', 'powers-that-be', 'would', 'rather', 'see', 'red', 'eyed', 'mooning', 'hysterical', 'wife', 'popping', 'off', 'wisecracks', 'KEEPING', 'THE', 'SHOW', 'MOVING', 'bad', 'decisions', 'series', 'producers', 'have', 'made', 'wasting', 'Piven', 'talent', 'soap', 'opera', 'stories', 'biggest', 'screw', 'up', 'guys', 'running', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'Groucho', 'Marx', 'playing', 'Hamlet', 'badly.More', 'bad', 'news', 'character', 'Lloyd', 'excellently', 'played', 'Rex', 'Lee', 'gone', 'series', 'What', 'rational', 'Stupidity', 'were', 'good', 'moves', 'overall', 'flatness', 'season', 'did', 'not', 'work', 'out', 'was', 'great', 'bring', 'back', 'Billy', 'Walsh', 'character', 'who', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'Billy', 'Walsh', 'character', 'reformed', '.and', 'damn', 'dull', 'idea', 'having', 'Drama', 'career', 'ascending', 'Vince', 'good', 'one', 'However', 'idea', 'done-in', 'deciding', 'get', 'nuclear', 'bomb', 'blow', 'up', 'Vince', 'career', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'more', 'important', 'funnier', 'have', 'Vince', 'simply', 'struggling', 'bad', 'career', 'decisions', 'etc', 'Drama', 'ass-backwards', 'success.The', 'core', 'show', 'formulaic', 'may', 'be', 'was', 'young', 'guys', 'lots', 'money', 'laughing', 'drinking', 'standing', 'amazement', 'good', 'fortune', 'when', 'credits', 'role', 'entourage', 'no', 'longer', 'entourage', 'Let', 'say', 'again', 'entourage', 'no', 'longer', 'entourage', 'have', 'little', 'subplots', 'pulling', 'character', 'own', 'world', 'hence', 'scenes', '.We', 'watched', 'two', 'episodes', 'wife', 'turned', 'said', 'Why', 'did', 'ruin', 'show', 'used', 'be', 'new', 'episodes', 'as', 'soon', 'aired', 'Now', 'see', 'when', 'think', 'fact', 'episode', '10', 'think', 'been', 'available', 'Sunday', 'still', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', ""'ll"", 'get', 'when', 'get', 'trend', 'next', 'season', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'just', 'leave', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'Entourage', 'order', 'explore', 'darkness', 'men', 'souls', 'watch', 'be', 'entertained', 'really', 'just', 'cotton', 'candy', 'probably', 'not', 'appeal', 'artistes', 'who', 'fancy', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'back', 'touch', 'vibe', 'show', 'done.Miscellaneous', 'notes:1', 'Why', 'would', 'idgits', 'running', 'show', 'not', 'use', 'excuse', 'possible', 'get', 'unbelievably', 'beautiful', 'talented', 'Debi', 'Mazar', 'possible', 'scene', 'Here', 'idea', 'Write', 'out', 'Sloan', 'give', 'Mazar', 'scene', 'left', 'vacant.2', 'just', 'Hollywood', 'turned', 'clever', 'way', 'probably', 'think', 'women', 'am', 'continuously', 'seeing', 'hysterical', 'unreasonable', 'female', 'characters', 'i.e', 'Ari', 'wife', 'sister', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'Carmelo', 'Soprano', 'who', 'married', 'mobster', 'simply', 'disgusted', 'fact', 'bad', 'things', 'Hollywood', 'women', 'RISE', 'UP', 'Entourage', 'producers', 'WISE', 'UP', '3', 'Someone', 'will', 'have', 'explain', 'big', 'deal', 'Sasha', 'Grey', 'porn', 'star', 'turned', 'would-be', 'legit', 'actress', 'not', 'particularly', 'good', 'looking', 'stiffness', 'great', 'value', 'day', 'job', 'not', 'particularly', 'appealing', 'when', 'acting']",N/A

The entourage crew is a interesting and likable as ever and during season 7 the show tried to bite into some juicy story lines. Unfortunately they bit off more than they could chew. So, while it's going to entertain you, if you're like me it also going to leave you frustrated.This season seemed to be filled by almost the entire entourage gang sabotaging their lives. With a show that only lasts for about 20 minutes & a season of only 10 episodes they just couldn't fit all of the plots in.  Sometime the majority of the show felt like filler & then in the last couple of minutes they would slam some major plot twist. The worst part is they wouldn't necessarily pick up the plot twist in the following episode. As an example we leave episode 6 not knowing if Vice has OD'ed on the side of the pool....a huge plot twist, episode 7 ignores the incident. I also think his friends would notice and intervene sooner. Even if they are sidetracked with their own lives they are a close nit group that really care for each other.The most developed storyline is Ari going after an NFL franchise and his abusive behavior finally blowing up in his face. I love his character but it is about time.There is Drama's character that spends 1/2 the season pestering everyone to make his career work for him and then when he gets a huge break wants to turn it down. Even Turtle's character was having a lot of plot twists, finally making something come together before it falls apart.You can see even with my summary it's a ton of plots and just too much to be accomplished in this season which at 10 episodes felt way shorter than usual.It feels like the network is ending the show and the writers are trying to pack multiple seasons into one.Bottom line: Will I watch this season again....you bet ya.

I was very excited when season 7 came out on DVD, but what a disappointment when I started watching.  The various story lines are boring, unbelievable or both.  All of the characters seem to have lost their defining qualities, or else they have just become calcified.  The Turtle subplot is just dull, and he was a much more compelling character in the earlier seasons. Turning him into a romantic lead (with an awful, tedious girlfriend) just isn't working for me.  Johnny Drama has become a whiny bore.  Eric is Eric, with his lovely but kinda boring fiancee.  Not much there besides picking out floral arrangements for the wedding.  And then we come to Vince.  Now, Adrian Grenier has never been a Pacino, but he had a certain almost ""beatific"" persona going on; he seemed to remain fairly centered while everything was swirling around him.  But this whole""downward slide"" story just feels forced.  He can't really carry it, and the Sasha  love-interest is pretty hard to., er, ""swallow"".  She isn't a  good actress, and her complete lack of charisma makes it hard to seewhy Vince is so determinedly nuts about her.  Nothing rings true in this scenario...Oh, I almost forgot:  the energy center for this whole endeavor ---  Ari Gold.  What happened???  He has LOST HIS EDGE!!  Unthinkable.  And I miss the Ari-Lloyd relationship, with its loving/abusive banter.  The writing in gerneral is so below par for this series, I had to check the credits to see if the same people were involved.One more nail in the cofin: the return of a reformed Billy Walsh, who as a Nice Guy is so lame and tedious, I staterd fast-forwarding thru his scenes. Then I realized I was fast-forwarding through Vince/Sasha, Turtle/Alex, nearly every sub-plot.  That's when I realized: I've stopped caring about ANY of these people.So I'm returning it to the library.  I know it's a great challenge to keep a show alive and vital.  I tip my hat to the creators for the 6 years of biting hilarity and genuine warmth.  But I think it's done.  I think Season 6 was the end.

Note the depressing last season of The Sopranos, The Shield, etc.-- the writers have exhausted all of their creativity in the first 5 years and feel the only place to go is one negative episode after another.Entourage was a fun upbeat series that was interesting because of the Hollywood ""insider"" perspective and guys who always laughed and smiled.  This 7th season is nothing but downbeat and depressing: Vince becomes a Lindsay Lohan train wreck with the drugs and self-destruction, and bringing in a porn star, playing a porn star, into the season as a love interest was a big mistake.  Sasha Gray cannot act -- that is, she cannot deliver convincing dialog nor walk across the set without bumping into the furniture.  She definitely was hired as a result of someone's casting couch.It would have been more interesting and exciting if the writers took the story lines in the opposite direction:  Show all of the characters becoming successful, fulfilling their dreams -- something very positive.If you like every episode filled with absurd public yelling and screaming and and no calm rational dialog, then you'll like this uncreative boring disaster where every character self-destructs.The writers forgot this was a comedy.
