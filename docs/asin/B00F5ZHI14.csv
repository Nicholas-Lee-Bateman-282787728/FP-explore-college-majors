1670486,A3AV1LQH5E9R4H,B00F5ZHI14,"Cheryl Gress ""ChristCenteredGamer""","[12, 14]","The main show on this nearly two-hour DVD is about Mickey and his Friends being granted super powers to transform their town back to normal after Power-Pants Pete shrinks everything.  With the help of each other, the mouseketools, and input from your child, they can conquer any obstacle!  I expected my five year old son to be comfortable with talking back to the television, but I was surprised to see my seven and nine year old daughters chiming in as well.  In fact, they asked to watch it multiple times.  My kids love all four episodes on this disc.  The included trading cards are a nice bonus too!",5,All of my kids love it!,1385164800,"11 23, 2013",2013,605,"['main', 'show', 'nearly', 'two-hour', 'DVD', 'Mickey', 'Friends', 'being', 'granted', 'super', 'powers', 'transform', 'town', 'back', 'normal', 'Power-Pants', 'Pete', 'everything', 'help', 'other', 'mouseketools', 'input', 'child', 'can', 'conquer', 'obstacle', 'expected', 'five', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'be', 'comfortable', 'talking', 'back', 'television', 'was', 'surprised', 'see', 'seven', 'nine', 'year', 'old', 'daughters', 'chiming', 'as', 'well', 'fact', 'asked', 'watch', 'multiple', 'times', 'kids', 'love', 'four', 'episodes', 'disc', 'included', 'trading', 'cards', 'are', 'nice', 'bonus', 'too']",Disney Mickey Mouse Clubhouse: Super Adventure

The show is great and a big hit in our house. It always has a positive message and teaches kids about a variety of subjects through the gang's adventures and interaction with your child. This is a great episode and my 3 year old is always asking for ""Super Mickey"".Super Adventure is a fun episode about the gang transforming into super heroes to battle against super villain Megamort and his sidekick, Power-Pants Pete.  The bad guys are shrinking everything and the gang springs into action to stop them.  The episode has a very ""Super Heroes"" feel to it and is done very well.This DVD contains the main title episode plus three great bonus episodes. Amazon doesn't always do a good job on their DVD episode listings so here are the episodes that are included on this DVD:1. Super Adventure!2. Aye, Aye, Captain Mickey - The gang must find Mickey's lost lucky coin using a submarine.3. Mickey's Mousekersize - Pete gets a lesson in exercising from the gang.4.
