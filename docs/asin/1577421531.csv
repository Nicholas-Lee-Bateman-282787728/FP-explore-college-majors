It IS NOT the original Image edition, but instead one from Screen Media Ventures, oh and it's a DVD-R. The cover is not even remotely close to the one shown on the page, the UPC code is a sticker stuck on the case, and again the back of the case says it's a DVD-R. Just wanted to make everyone aware before you purchase an inferior DVD-R and have to waste time trying to get a refund.

She's turned down by agency after agency until she decides to do what she loves;story telling. She manages to get a spot on a public tv station and becomes a hit. Then the fun begins. She is &quot;discovered&quot; by some ad executives who see a gold mine in exploiting her talents.A whirlwind of network ratings, make overs and new name (Granny Goodheart) overwhelms Grace. How she navigates through this mess is a delightful commentary about how we treat our elders, our own children and ourselves in a doggy eat dog world of our own making.Jessica Tandy is wonderful as Grace, the grandmotherly figure unwilling to let the studio bosses remake her image. Stephanie Zimbalist stars as the ad executive who is so caught up in her work to the point of neglecting what matters most, her daughter. In this film we re-aquaint ourselves with the taste of what it means to be a family and affirmed in one's old age.Now sit back and enjoy the Story Lady as she reads you a tale where &quot;they live happily ever after.

192433,A1K4AVQIU704DY,1577421531,"Nancy Sherburne ""a Phil Ochs fan""","[0, 0]","There is not much Christmas in this movie, but there is a lesson to all workaholics, especially single parents. I love the Jessica Tandy-Hume Cronyn partnership, but she does very well on her own, along with quite a cast. It must be hard on a senior citizen to have to give up their independence and move in with their grown children, but Grace has enough spirit of her own to go so far as to star in her own cable show. It is too bad it didn't end there, but if it had, a young businesswoman growing apart from her daughter might never have seen the need to cut back on her work schedule to spend more time with her. Watching the mother, rushing from a late meeting to the school for her daughter's play reminds me so much of the father in Hook rushing from work to see his son's baseball game. Both parents miss out, but in the end, both are taught children need to come first in their lives, not work. In The Story Lady, I could understand Alexadra's disappointment that her mother missed her play, but got all teary-eyed when in the end she tells her mother she loves her. I know the actor who plays Grace's son-in-law from his role on Murder, She Wrote, and it was funny seeing Charles Durning playing a judge rather than Santa Claus as he does in Mrs. Santa Claus and It Nearly Wasn't Christmas, and Ed Begley, Jr. as a heartless jerk taking advantage of a seemingly-naive woman. I did find it a bit hard to swallow some of the goings-on (Granny Goodheart for one) but if I look forward to watching it every year, there must be a good reason.",5,There's Still Time,1167523200,"12 31, 2006",2006,1548,"['not', 'much', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'lesson', 'workaholics', 'especially', 'single', 'parents', 'love', 'Jessica', 'Tandy-Hume', 'Cronyn', 'partnership', 'very', 'well', 'own', 'cast', 'must', 'be', 'hard', 'senior', 'citizen', 'have', 'give', 'up', 'independence', 'move', 'grown', 'children', 'Grace', 'enough', 'spirit', 'own', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'star', 'own', 'cable', 'show', 'too', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'end', 'there', 'had', 'young', 'businesswoman', 'growing', 'apart', 'daughter', 'might', 'never', 'have', 'seen', 'need', 'cut', 'back', 'work', 'schedule', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'Watching', 'mother', 'rushing', 'late', 'meeting', 'school', 'daughter', 'play', 'so', 'much', 'father', 'Hook', 'rushing', 'work', 'see', 'son', 'baseball', 'game', 'parents', 'miss', 'out', 'end', 'are', 'taught', 'children', 'need', 'come', 'first', 'lives', 'not', 'work', 'Story', 'Lady', 'could', 'understand', 'Alexadra', 'disappointment', 'mother', 'missed', 'play', 'got', 'teary-eyed', 'when', 'end', 'mother', 'know', 'actor', 'who', 'Grace', 'son-in-law', 'role', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'was', 'funny', 'seeing', 'Charles', 'Durning', 'playing', 'judge', 'rather', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'Mrs.', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'Nearly', 'Was', ""n't"", 'Christmas', 'Ed', 'Begley', 'Jr.', 'heartless', 'jerk', 'taking', 'advantage', 'seemingly-naive', 'woman', 'did', 'find', 'bit', 'hard', 'swallow', 'goings-on', 'Granny', 'Goodheart', 'one', 'look', 'forward', 'watching', 'year', 'must', 'be', 'good', 'reason']",Story Lady VHS

Lacking something to fill her time she reads stories on a public cable channel having her own show. It is truly captivating to listen to Tandy read these children's fairy tales that we all have grown up with. That is the special thing in the movie. An ad exec discovers her played by Stephanie Zimbalist and tries to make Grace over for network tv. Along the way Grace meets Alex- the ad exec's daughter whose mother (Zimbalist) never has time for her and they develop a relationship which is nice to see. This movie shows the importance of being yourself and when people are trying to change you- how to stick to your guns and not cave in to pressure and how tough it can be to find something to fill your hours as an older person who isn't working. Overall, a great movie that shows the importance of family and friends and staying true to who you are.",4,Wonderful movie,1233273600,"01 30, 2009",2009,969,"['was', 'excellent', 'movie', 'Jessica', 'Tandy', 'starring', 'Grace', 'older', 'lady', 'who', 'live', 'daughter', 'Lacking', 'something', 'fill', 'time', 'stories', 'public', 'cable', 'channel', 'having', 'own', 'show', 'truly', 'captivating', 'listen', 'Tandy', 'read', 'children', 'fairy', 'tales', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'special', 'thing', 'movie', 'ad', 'exec', 'played', 'Stephanie', 'Zimbalist', 'tries', 'make', 'Grace', 'network', 'tv', 'way', 'Grace', 'Alex-', 'ad', 'exec', 'daughter', 'mother', 'Zimbalist', 'never', 'time', 'develop', 'relationship', 'nice', 'see', 'movie', 'importance', 'being', 'when', 'people', 'are', 'trying', 'change', 'you-', 'how', 'stick', 'guns', 'not', 'cave', 'pressure', 'how', 'tough', 'can', 'be', 'find', 'something', 'fill', 'hours', 'older', 'person', 'who', ""n't"", 'working', 'Overall', 'great', 'movie', 'importance', 'family', 'friends', 'staying', 'true', 'who', 'are']",Story Lady VHS
