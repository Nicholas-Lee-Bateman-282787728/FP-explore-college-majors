1695421,ASBGPDCWRP11A,B00J49R1BY,"DLHSmith ""DLHS""","[0, 0]","I rarely give five stars to anything - but to this movie I do. It's about belief that a man can change, just as the pastor in the movie died for. When I first saw this on Hallmark Movie Channel, I was caught up in the story. I love surprises, and this movie and story did not disappoint.It's great to watch Henry Myers change gradually. He wants to, but after his first revelation of what he did, he wasn't sure he could. And the widow and her children were fun to watch. When the widow discovers Henry's secret, of course she is angry beyond belief, as is her son. and yet, in the end - it's about forgiveness.It's about redemption. I so loved Henry's scene in the desert where he rails against what he had become, and how he wanted to be changed. All that came before at the widow's house was seeding into Henry's decision to change. Because it's a choice to change. We need God's help to do it.I felt this was a great western with believable characters and a plausible and surprising plot. The twists were great! I love that kind of thing.

There was something just a little bit flat for me, but overall, it was a great story about change that seemed to happen a lot in that time period of American history. It felt relatively true to life. There were a couple of slips in the greetings, but the movie stayed on track for most of the time.",4,This was a very good western movie with a spiritual theme,1405814400,"07 20, 2014",2014,425,"['was', 'very', 'good', 'western', 'movie', 'spiritual', 'theme', 'cast', 'were', 'pretty', 'well', 'versed', 'period', 'behavior', 'speech', 'was', 'something', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'flat', 'overall', 'was', 'great', 'story', 'change', 'seemed', 'happen', 'lot', 'time', 'period', 'American', 'history', 'felt', 'relatively', 'true', 'life', 'were', 'couple', 'slips', 'greetings', 'movie', 'stayed', 'track', 'most', 'time']",The Redemption of Henry Myers

1695426,A22OYFX91WK34T,B00J49R1BY,Paul R. Varn,"[1, 1]","The quality of the production and acting is of a high quality you would expect from a Hallmark distribution.  Although only available in SD, the quality of the stream offered is comparable to other SD streams I've viewed on this service. The emotional scenes have an authenticity missing in most modern films with a spiritual tone.  The Western era turn of the century revival culture provides an atmosphere where Biblical concepts could be more openly expressed as opposed to our present culture where political correctness and outright antagonism disdains frank discussion.  The music is richly scored and era appropriate.The story is predicable within the context of 100 years of Hollywood westerns.  There is no offensive language or sexual overtone which is a VERY WELCOME relief from standard fare.  I would not view the film with very young children who may be sensitive to gun violence there there are several gun flights with bleeding wounds and death.-Pv-",4,The quality of the production and acting is of a ...,1404950400,"07 10, 2014",2014,965,"['quality', 'production', 'acting', 'high', 'quality', 'would', 'expect', 'Hallmark', 'distribution', 'only', 'available', 'SD', 'quality', 'stream', 'offered', 'comparable', 'other', 'SD', 'streams', ""'ve"", 'viewed', 'service', 'emotional', 'scenes', 'have', 'authenticity', 'missing', 'most', 'modern', 'films', 'spiritual', 'tone', 'Western', 'era', 'turn', 'century', 'revival', 'culture', 'atmosphere', 'where', 'Biblical', 'concepts', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'openly', 'expressed', 'opposed', 'present', 'culture', 'where', 'political', 'correctness', 'outright', 'antagonism', 'disdains', 'frank', 'discussion', 'music', 'richly', 'scored', 'era', 'appropriate.The', 'story', 'predicable', 'context', '100', 'years', 'Hollywood', 'westerns', 'offensive', 'language', 'sexual', 'overtone', 'VERY', 'WELCOME', 'relief', 'standard', 'fare', 'would', 'not', 'view', 'film', 'very', 'young', 'children', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'sensitive', 'gun', 'violence', 'there', 'are', 'several', 'gun', 'flights', 'bleeding', 'wounds', 'death.-Pv-']",The Redemption of Henry Myers
