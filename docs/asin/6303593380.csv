381018,A2BPDFR58H9575,6303593380,Galina,"[16, 16]","This comedy/mystery is simply delightful. You can call it a masterpiece of its genre(s) or you can just enjoy its great timing, hilarious physical comedy, its story that involves spies, murders, and a sexy blonde (Mireille Darc) in a dress you have to see to believe. Pierre Richar is excellent as the blond man of the title who one day became a ""person of great interest"" for two rival departments in the French secret service. As we know, it is very difficult to find a black cat in a dark room especially if the cat is not in the room and that's what the experienced employees of the secret service try to do - to find the sense in the routine activities of a man they are convinced is an important spy and who is in reality an absent-minded and oblivious violinist and the object of the practical jokes by his fellow musicians.If it is not enough, there is a soundtrack written by Vladimir Cosma and performed by the King of Pan Flute, a famous Romanian musician Gheorghe Zamfir. Cosma recalls that when he was composing the music for The Tall Blond Man, he was thinking of the movie ""The Spy Who Came in From the Cold"" and he wanted to use the elements of the Eastern European music. His idea to use the themes of Romanian doinas played by Zamfir was a stroke of genius. Once you hear the melodies, you won't be able to forget them.5 to the movie and 5+ to the soundtrack",5,"Perfect Comedy with Great Soundtrack,",1166486400,"12 19, 2006",2006,1376,"['comedy/mystery', 'simply', 'delightful', 'can', 'call', 'masterpiece', 'genre', 's', 'can', 'just', 'enjoy', 'great', 'timing', 'hilarious', 'physical', 'comedy', 'story', 'spies', 'murders', 'sexy', 'blonde', 'Mireille', 'Darc', 'dress', 'have', 'see', 'believe', 'Pierre', 'Richar', 'excellent', 'blond', 'man', 'title', 'who', 'one', 'day', 'became', 'person', 'great', 'interest', 'two', 'rival', 'departments', 'French', 'secret', 'service', 'know', 'very', 'difficult', 'find', 'black', 'cat', 'dark', 'room', 'especially', 'cat', 'not', 'room', 'what', 'experienced', 'employees', 'secret', 'service', 'try', 'do', 'find', 'sense', 'routine', 'activities', 'man', 'are', 'convinced', 'important', 'spy', 'who', 'reality', 'absent-minded', 'oblivious', 'violinist', 'object', 'practical', 'jokes', 'fellow', 'musicians.If', 'not', 'enough', 'soundtrack', 'written', 'Vladimir', 'Cosma', 'performed', 'King', 'Pan', 'Flute', 'famous', 'Romanian', 'musician', 'Gheorghe', 'Zamfir', 'Cosma', 'when', 'was', 'composing', 'music', 'Tall', 'Blond', 'Man', 'was', 'thinking', 'movie', 'Spy', 'Who', 'Came', 'From', 'Cold', 'wanted', 'use', 'elements', 'Eastern', 'European', 'music', 'idea', 'use', 'themes', 'Romanian', 'doinas', 'played', 'Zamfir', 'was', 'stroke', 'genius', 'hear', 'melodies', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'forget', 'them.5', 'movie', '5+', 'soundtrack']",Tall Blond Man With One Black Shoe Subtitled  VHS
