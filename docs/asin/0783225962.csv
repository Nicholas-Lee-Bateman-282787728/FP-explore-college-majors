Some funny and touching moments from Martin, Mary Steenburgen, Dianne Weist, Jason Robards, Keanu Reeves and Leaf Phoenix who later changed his name to Joaquin.

54471,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0783225962,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 1]","Ron Howard is the undisputed king of schmaltz; I mean, seriously, does he do anything other than feel good heart tuggers?  `Parenthood' was one of his earlier successes, and its easy to see why it was so well loved.  You have a group of very talented actors weaving together a touching story about family and love and togetherness and it's presented with a shiny red bow that will make your eyes glisten with anticipation.Yes, this movie is very likable.You have Gil, who was never really loved by his father, who is trying to wrap his head around the concept that his son may need psychological counseling.  His sister Helen is raising her two children on her own and is having quite a bit of trouble with her boy crazy teenage daughter and her reclusive pre-teen son.  Their sister Susan is married to a man who is so controlling and precise that its driving her crazy, not to mention stunting their young daughters ability to interact with children her own age.  Then you have their `black sheep' younger brother Larry who just showed up back in town with an illegitimate child he just found out he had and a gambling debt that is through the roof.  Despite their very different circumstances, each sibling is just trying to be the best parent they can be (well, maybe not Larry, but his story has another arc).The good things about this movie lie within the wonderfully charming performances by the entire cast, Wiest and Martin shining as beacons amidst a cast of very talented actors.  As Gil, Steve Martin is wonderfully sincere, playing the `real' father with such believability, not to mention likeability.  He makes such a nice dad, you just want to wrap your arms around him and tell him he's doing a good job.  Dianne Wiest is marvelous as single parent Helen, weaving masterfully in and out of emotional outbursts and emotional breakdowns.  She is so wonderfully charismatic and comedic gold, I seriously think she may be the greatest supporting actress working today.  Rick Moranis has a nice turn here as the controlling Nathan, and Jason Robards is marvelous as the family patriarch Frank, who slowly is learning himself how to be a father.  I was also very impressed with young Joaquin Phoenix (here going by the name Leaf) who plays Helen's young son Garry.The entire cast is wonderful here though, everyone from Tom Hulce to Mary Steenburgen to Harley Jane Kozak; even Keanu Reeves turns in a decently comedic performance as the boneheaded, yet deep hearted Tod.The film falls short in some other areas though, areas that may not be so noticeable right off the bat.  The film is very heavy handed (Howard's specialty), and while I've always said that if anyone can pull off heavy handed it is Ron Howard, I must admit that sometimes he can lather it on too much.  In recent years he has perfected his heavy hand, so that he can serve us syrup that goes down like water (just watch `Cinderella Man' and tell me it isn't easy to swallow despite the fact that it is emotional gravy) but `Parenthood' is not a recent effort and so it lacks the technique that Howard has perfected over the years.  There is just so much `drama' going on in one family that it comes off rather forced at times, especially when you take a second to breath it all in.  Another issue I had was the fact that the film reaches its crescendo of `drama' and then jumps ahead to a happy ending without ever really explaining how they got there.  You know that they are trying and you know basically what they are planning to do to fix things, but they never show this take place.  They bring you to the breaking point and then flash forward to the solution.  I've seen this done in other films and it's always a slight disappointment.These few issues shouldn't keep you away from this film, but they do hold the film back from really being everything it could have been.  See the movie for its charm and for the dynamic performance by Martin and Wiest (so glad she was Oscar nominated for this) but don't expect a film to break the mold here.  It is bedded down by clich&eacute;s and oppressed by the weight of Howard's directorial hand, but its good, clean fun that is sure to entertain none-the-less.",3,A superb cast elevates this rather heavy handed vehicle...,1221609600,"09 17, 2008",2008,4190,"['Ron', 'Howard', 'undisputed', 'king', 'schmaltz', 'mean', 'seriously', 'do', 'anything', 'other', 'feel', 'good', 'heart', 'tuggers', 'Parenthood', 'was', 'one', 'earlier', 'successes', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'well', 'loved', 'have', 'group', 'very', 'talented', 'actors', 'weaving', 'together', 'touching', 'story', 'family', 'love', 'togetherness', 'presented', 'shiny', 'red', 'bow', 'will', 'make', 'eyes', 'glisten', 'anticipation.Yes', 'movie', 'very', 'likable.You', 'have', 'Gil', 'who', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'loved', 'father', 'who', 'trying', 'wrap', 'head', 'concept', 'son', 'may', 'need', 'psychological', 'counseling', 'sister', 'Helen', 'raising', 'two', 'children', 'own', 'having', 'quite', 'bit', 'trouble', 'boy', 'crazy', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'reclusive', 'pre-teen', 'son', 'sister', 'Susan', 'married', 'man', 'who', 'so', 'controlling', 'precise', 'driving', 'crazy', 'not', 'mention', 'stunting', 'young', 'daughters', 'ability', 'interact', 'children', 'own', 'age', 'Then', 'have', 'black', 'sheep', 'younger', 'brother', 'Larry', 'who', 'just', 'showed', 'up', 'back', 'town', 'illegitimate', 'child', 'just', 'found', 'out', 'had', 'gambling', 'debt', 'roof', 'very', 'different', 'circumstances', 'sibling', 'just', 'trying', 'be', 'best', 'parent', 'can', 'be', 'well', 'maybe', 'not', 'Larry', 'story', 'arc', '.The', 'good', 'things', 'movie', 'lie', 'wonderfully', 'charming', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'Wiest', 'Martin', 'shining', 'beacons', 'amidst', 'cast', 'very', 'talented', 'actors', 'Gil', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'wonderfully', 'sincere', 'playing', 'real', 'father', 'such', 'believability', 'not', 'mention', 'likeability', 'nice', 'dad', 'just', 'want', 'wrap', 'arms', 'tell', 'doing', 'good', 'job', 'Dianne', 'Wiest', 'marvelous', 'single', 'parent', 'Helen', 'weaving', 'masterfully', 'emotional', 'outbursts', 'emotional', 'breakdowns', 'so', 'wonderfully', 'charismatic', 'comedic', 'gold', 'seriously', 'think', 'may', 'be', 'greatest', 'supporting', 'actress', 'working', 'today', 'Rick', 'Moranis', 'nice', 'turn', 'here', 'controlling', 'Nathan', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'marvelous', 'family', 'patriarch', 'Frank', 'who', 'slowly', 'learning', 'how', 'be', 'father', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'impressed', 'young', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'here', 'going', 'name', 'Leaf', 'who', 'Helen', 'young', 'son', 'Garry.The', 'entire', 'cast', 'wonderful', 'here', 'everyone', 'Tom', 'Hulce', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'Harley', 'Jane', 'Kozak', 'even', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'decently', 'comedic', 'performance', 'boneheaded', 'yet', 'deep', 'hearted', 'Tod.The', 'film', 'short', 'other', 'areas', 'areas', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'noticeable', 'right', 'bat', 'film', 'very', 'heavy', 'handed', 'Howard', 'specialty', ""'ve"", 'always', 'said', 'anyone', 'can', 'pull', 'off', 'heavy', 'handed', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'must', 'admit', 'sometimes', 'can', 'lather', 'too', 'much', 'recent', 'years', 'perfected', 'heavy', 'hand', 'can', 'serve', 'syrup', 'down', 'like', 'water', 'just', 'watch', 'Cinderella', 'Man', 'tell', ""n't"", 'easy', 'swallow', 'fact', 'emotional', 'gravy', 'Parenthood', 'not', 'recent', 'effort', 'technique', 'Howard', 'perfected', 'years', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'drama', 'going', 'one', 'family', 'rather', 'forced', 'times', 'especially', 'when', 'take', 'second', 'breath', 'issue', 'had', 'was', 'fact', 'film', 'crescendo', 'drama', 'then', 'jumps', 'ahead', 'happy', 'ending', 'ever', 'really', 'explaining', 'how', 'got', 'there', 'know', 'are', 'trying', 'know', 'basically', 'what', 'are', 'planning', 'do', 'fix', 'things', 'never', 'show', 'take', 'place', 'bring', 'breaking', 'point', 'then', 'flash', 'forward', 'solution', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'done', 'other', 'films', 'always', 'slight', 'disappointment.These', 'few', 'issues', 'should', ""n't"", 'keep', 'away', 'film', 'do', 'hold', 'film', 'back', 'really', 'being', 'everything', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'See', 'movie', 'charm', 'dynamic', 'performance', 'Martin', 'Wiest', 'so', 'glad', 'was', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'film', 'break', 'mold', 'here', 'bedded', 'down', 'clich', 'eacute', 'oppressed', 'weight', 'Howard', 'directorial', 'hand', 'good', 'clean', 'fun', 'sure', 'entertain', 'none-the-less']",N/A

It's one of the funniest and most inspiring movies that I've ever seen, an honest and touching portrayal of family and the perils it goes through.Steve Martin turns in an unforgettable performance as Gil, a father of three who can't manage a stable relationship with his kids nor his wife (Mary Steenburgen). Despite valiant efforts, his personal life as well his job seem to be going down the crapper. Meanwhile, his sister Helen (Dianne Wiest) is having troubles of her own, trying to deal with her isolated son Gary (a young Joaquin Phoenix) as well as her daughter's (Martha Plimpton) relationship with ""that Todd"" (Keanu Reeves in what is undoubtedly his best screen role ever). Meanwhile his other sister Susan and her husband (Rick Moranis, always a treat) are having troubles of their own, mostly over their highly intelligent daughter Patty. Finally, there's Gil's brother Larry (Tom Hulce), whose addiction to high stakes gambling has put a damper on his relationship with his father (a scene stealing Jason Robards). All of these characters are believable thanks to excellent performances by the actors, and while it seems rather clutterd, the film is in fact an excellent look at family life.This film is sad, touching and often hysterical.

54481,A2JXAQ92WYPAAR,0783225962,"David Schweizer ""Almawood""","[1, 2]","Steve Martin is a favorite among those of my generation who remember his antics on Saturday Night Live. My god, what a nut he was to behold. He has largely been a disappointment since his early years, maturing into a kind of Gregory Peck comic of decency and good will. This film is a surprise because Martin is joined by a team of incredible actors, possibly unrivaled in modern cinema. Dianne Wiest, a favorite of Woody Allen's, is very good here, giving a performance of dramatic strength and comic timing. There is an odd appearance of a very young Keanu Reeves at one extreme of the generational gap, and Jason Robards, who takes up the other end. He is a very impressive and commanding grandfather.  Tom Hulce brings up the rear in a major part, playing a gambler and loser, whose addiction and cynicism is painful but honest. Overall, this is a comic film made by a group of Hollywood parents who evidently wanted to say something about their lives. Martin has been pushing parenthood for quite a while, as has director Ron Howard. I guess it is OK for actors to be artistically talented and responsible family advocates.

54484,A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4,0783225962,Elisabeth,"[1, 1]","This movie follows four parents as they struggle to make the right parenting decisions for their kids.  Each of the parents are thrown a curveball they're not sure how to handle correctly.For the grandfather Frank (Jason Robards), it's dealing with a son with a gambling addiction.For Gil (Steve Martin) and his wife, it's dealing with a son who's bipolar.For single mom Helen (Dianne Wiest), it's a double-whammy -- dealing with a daughter dating a guy she disapproves of and dealing with a son who's pulling farther and farther away from her.And with Nathan (Rick Moranis), it's not his daughter who throws him a curveball, but his wife.  The woman who once supported his overachieving parenting style now challenges it, saying it's affecting their daughter's ability to relate to other little kids and affecting their marriage, too.Although these problems are serious, they unfold in an amusing way.  There's many funny scenes in this movie like ""the electric ear cleaner"", the mix-up with Cowboy Dan, all the scenes with the grandma, and many more.  But my favorite scene was when Gil has two opposing fantasies about what kind of son he'll raise and what kind of father he'll be as a result.In his first fantasy, he envisions his son growing up to be a valedictorian telling the audience he had the perfect father who never made any mistakes.In his second fantasy, he envisions his son growing up to be a gun-shooting psychopath and the people fleeing for their life are blaming the father for not letting his son play third base in baseball...which obviously would screw up any kid this seriously.It's the extreme either/or fantasy that cracked me up laughing and also successfully illustrates Gil's obsession with being the perfect father.Besides the comedic moments, there were also touching moments as well.  I especially liked the story the grandma tells about the rollercoaster and the hidden lesson in there for Gil.  I also like the scene where Nathan seranades his wife in class.This is a feel-good comedy that ends on a feel-good note.  So if you're looking for an ending with gritty realism, you won't find it here.  Instead the ending wraps up a little too conveniently with smiles and hugs, but that was fine with me.

54488,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,0783225962,Gregor von Kallahann,"[2, 5]","Hollywood has been such an easy target for cultural conservatives.  The ""family values"" crowd knows how to appeal to their base, and pot shots at ""limousine liberals"" is one way to get that base suitably riled.  So much Hollywood product is dismissed by these folks as being ""anti-family"" that one has to remind oneself that there have been any number of films in recent decades that grapple with the theme of contemporary family life: what it is, what it traditionally has been, and, yes, just where we, as a society, may have gone wrong.Dyed-in-the-wool cultural conservatives may still not embrace a film like Ron Howard's PARENTHOOD.  Heck, they may not embrace any film that doesn't end with a family joining together in prayer and thanksgiving.  PARENTHOOD is a loving look at messed-up, stuggling, neurotic families, doing their level best to make sense of it all.  And to juggle it all.  It doesn't offer any easy answers, in fact it leaves most of the questions still pretty much open.This is the kind of film director Ron Howard does well, with an ensemble cast and compelling, complementary storylines.  Later on, he would show strain with more self-consciously arty films like A BEAUTIFUL MIND.  It's tempting to view PARENTHOOD as something of an extension of Howard's childhood and adolescent  television roles--warm loving looks at families, who were not stable if not totally conventional (Opie had no mom, after all), but always surrounded by endearingly eccentric friends and neighbors.  (Opie had a slew, of course, from Barney and Floyd, to Otis--talk about an early education in human eccentricity.  And Richie had, well, the Fonz).  That same loving tolerance of human foibles is to be found in PARENTHOOD.There is a key difference, however.  In Mayberry, you could count on Otis to take the initiative to lock HIMSELF up when he went on a bender.  Here--probably more accurately--the wayward, clearly troubled  son (Tom Hulce)cannot manage to even help himself that much.  His only recourse when the chips are down (as they nearly always are in his case) is to turn to his gruff, but ultimately indulgent dad (Jason Robards) for rescue.So much has been said about Steve Martin's performance here.  This is one of the roles that helped establish Martin as a good actor, and not just an off-the-wall comic.  Like Bill Murray and Robin Williams, he has displayed considerable range in more ""grown up"" roles.  In PARENTHOOD, he gets to goof a bit, but it's IN CHARACTER.  As a devoted dad, he attempts to save his son's birthday party by subbing for a no-show hired cowboy.  And he pulls it off--not as Steve Martin wild and crazy guy, but as Gil Buckman becoming just wild and crazy enough to throroughly win over one of the toughest audiences imaginable--a bunch of ten year olds.As mentioned, this is an ensemble piece, and there really isn't a bad performance in the lot. The old pros are as good as you would expect.  (I know Jason Robards could do these lovable curmudgeon roles in his sleep, but he is genuinely touching in his scenes with sons Martin and Hulce).  Mary Steenburgen is a warm and lovely here as in anything she has appeared in.  And Dianne Wiest is always remarkable.  The younger actors are all spot on (and, yes, that would include Keanu--as well as all the child actors, including a strikingly moody young Joaquin ""Leaf"" Phoenix).One actor who does not tend to get cited in reviews is the gifted Harley Jane Kozak (here billed simply as ""Harley Kozak"").  I couldn't help notice that one reviewer below repeatedly confused her with Martha Plimpton, the young actress who played Dianne Wiest's troubled daughter.  Well, they are both wonderful, but the error (in an otherwise excellent review, by the way) should be cleared up.  Martha has, of course, carved out a name for herself as a pastmaster of quirky roles.  It would be nice to see more recognition for the equally wonderful Kozak too.  (And yes, I am as guilty as anyone else...when she first appeared here, I said, ""Oh, it's Karen Allen."")PARENTHOOD is a family film for a new era.  There are hugs, but they're a little tentative.  There are moments when walls start to break down, only to be quickly built back up.  But these are little personal victories, hard won after all.  For the most part, PARENTHOOD rings true.  And that makes its particular ""focus on the family"" a pretty honest one.  It's tender, sure, but tentative.",4,Focus On the Family,1122940800,"08 2, 2005",2005,4432,"['Hollywood', 'been', 'easy', 'target', 'cultural', 'conservatives', 'family', 'values', 'crowd', 'how', 'appeal', 'base', 'pot', 'shots', 'limousine', 'liberals', 'one', 'way', 'get', 'base', 'suitably', 'riled', 'So', 'much', 'Hollywood', 'product', 'dismissed', 'folks', 'being', 'anti-family', 'one', 'remind', 'have', 'been', 'number', 'films', 'recent', 'decades', 'grapple', 'theme', 'contemporary', 'family', 'life', 'what', 'what', 'traditionally', 'been', 'yes', 'just', 'where', 'society', 'may', 'have', 'gone', 'wrong.Dyed-in-the-wool', 'cultural', 'conservatives', 'may', 'still', 'not', 'embrace', 'film', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'PARENTHOOD', 'Heck', 'may', 'not', 'embrace', 'film', ""n't"", 'end', 'family', 'joining', 'together', 'prayer', 'thanksgiving', 'PARENTHOOD', 'loving', 'look', 'messed-up', 'stuggling', 'neurotic', 'families', 'doing', 'level', 'best', 'make', 'sense', 'juggle', ""n't"", 'offer', 'easy', 'answers', 'fact', 'most', 'questions', 'still', 'pretty', 'much', 'open.This', 'kind', 'film', 'director', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'well', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'compelling', 'complementary', 'storylines', 'Later', 'would', 'show', 'strain', 'more', 'self-consciously', 'arty', 'films', 'BEAUTIFUL', 'MIND', 'tempting', 'view', 'PARENTHOOD', 'something', 'extension', 'Howard', 'childhood', 'adolescent', 'television', 'roles', 'warm', 'loving', 'looks', 'families', 'who', 'were', 'not', 'stable', 'not', 'totally', 'conventional', 'Opie', 'had', 'mom', 'always', 'surrounded', 'endearingly', 'eccentric', 'friends', 'neighbors', 'Opie', 'had', 'slew', 'course', 'Barney', 'Floyd', 'Otis', 'talk', 'early', 'education', 'human', 'eccentricity', 'Richie', 'had', 'well', 'Fonz', 'same', 'loving', 'tolerance', 'human', 'foibles', 'be', 'found', 'PARENTHOOD.There', 'key', 'difference', 'however', 'Mayberry', 'could', 'count', 'Otis', 'take', 'initiative', 'lock', 'HIMSELF', 'up', 'when', 'went', 'bender', 'Here', 'probably', 'more', 'accurately', 'wayward', 'clearly', 'troubled', 'son', 'Tom', 'Hulce', 'can', 'not', 'manage', 'even', 'help', 'much', 'only', 'recourse', 'when', 'chips', 'are', 'down', 'nearly', 'always', 'are', 'case', 'turn', 'gruff', 'ultimately', 'indulgent', 'dad', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'rescue.So', 'much', 'been', 'said', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'performance', 'here', 'one', 'roles', 'helped', 'establish', 'Martin', 'good', 'actor', 'not', 'just', 'off-the-wall', 'comic', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'displayed', 'considerable', 'range', 'more', 'grown', 'up', 'roles', 'PARENTHOOD', 'goof', 'bit', 'IN', 'CHARACTER', 'devoted', 'dad', 'save', 'son', 'birthday', 'party', 'subbing', 'no-show', 'hired', 'cowboy', 'off', 'not', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'wild', 'crazy', 'guy', 'Gil', 'Buckman', 'becoming', 'just', 'wild', 'crazy', 'enough', 'throroughly', 'win', 'one', 'toughest', 'audiences', 'imaginable', 'bunch', 'ten', 'year', 'olds.As', 'mentioned', 'ensemble', 'piece', 'there', 'really', ""n't"", 'bad', 'performance', 'lot', 'old', 'pros', 'are', 'as', 'good', 'would', 'expect', 'know', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'could', 'do', 'lovable', 'curmudgeon', 'roles', 'sleep', 'genuinely', 'touching', 'scenes', 'sons', 'Martin', 'Hulce', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'warm', 'lovely', 'here', 'anything', 'appeared', 'Dianne', 'Wiest', 'always', 'remarkable', 'younger', 'actors', 'are', 'spot', 'yes', 'would', 'include', 'Keanu', 'as', 'well', 'child', 'actors', 'including', 'strikingly', 'moody', 'young', 'Joaquin', 'Leaf', 'Phoenix', '.One', 'actor', 'who', 'not', 'tend', 'get', 'cited', 'reviews', 'gifted', 'Harley', 'Jane', 'Kozak', 'here', 'billed', 'simply', 'Harley', 'Kozak', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'notice', 'one', 'reviewer', 'repeatedly', 'confused', 'Martha', 'Plimpton', 'young', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'Dianne', 'Wiest', 'troubled', 'daughter', 'Well', 'are', 'wonderful', 'error', 'otherwise', 'excellent', 'review', 'way', 'should', 'be', 'cleared', 'up', 'Martha', 'course', 'carved', 'out', 'name', 'pastmaster', 'quirky', 'roles', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'see', 'more', 'recognition', 'equally', 'wonderful', 'Kozak', 'too', 'yes', 'am', 'as', 'guilty', 'anyone', 'else', 'when', 'first', 'appeared', 'here', 'said', 'Oh', 'Karen', 'Allen', 'PARENTHOOD', 'family', 'film', 'new', 'era', 'are', 'hugs', ""'re"", 'little', 'tentative', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'walls', 'start', 'break', 'down', 'only', 'be', 'quickly', 'built', 'back', 'up', 'are', 'little', 'personal', 'victories', 'hard', 'won', 'most', 'part', 'PARENTHOOD', 'true', 'particular', 'focus', 'family', 'pretty', 'honest', 'one', 'tender', 'sure', 'tentative']",N/A

54493,AM5WLF25DW3XU,0783225962,Joe Comer,"[1, 2]","Steve Martin is top billed in this film and he is excellent but the rest of the cast is just as good.  This movie is actually divided into four  separate parts-four different branch offs of the same family (the father,  his kids and their families)-that allows this fine ensemble to portray all  the ups and downs of family life.  It is a film that teaches without  without the valleys.  And because of it every character comes to stark  realizations about themselves and their relationships with other people.  All the characters, that is, except the Tom Hulce character.  But even that  character is correctly written; it just simply isn't the time for him to  realize.The interactions between the father (Jason Robards) and his two  sons (Hulce and Martin) tell us much about all three characters' past,  present and future.  Unfortunately there isn't any interaction between the  father and the two daughters (Martha Plimpton and Dianne Wiest) but with so  many characters to deal with and so many ties to bind, there simply wasn't  time.  But the time the writers have is well spent indeed.  Lowell Ganz and  Babaloo Mandel have written a script which takes a very basic idea and  expands on it in a realistic and original way.  It's no wonder that all the  characters are tied together so perfectly in the end.Ron Howard has taken  that script and directed these tremendous performers to superlative work.  Very seldom have any of them been better.  Steve Martin shines in his  everyman portrayal of the father of three and the second oldest child of  the four earlier mentioned.  Not since ROXANNE had he given a performance  of such range and depth.  His work here ranks among his best ever!  Dianne  Wiest as his older sister won another Oscar nomination and is just as good  as she was in HANNAH AND HER SISTERS.  Martha Plimpton as the next oldest  child is fine as a mother torn between her high-tech-education-supporter  husband (Rick Moranis, his best work since LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS) and her  young childhood deprived daughter.  Hulce is the youngest of Robards four  kids and has the toughest role to play.  He wasn't given the one-liners the  others have.  His character isn't likeable.  His father obviously favors  him at first which is hard for the rest of the family as well as the  audience to understand.  But he portrays the character as it should be  Robards portrayal of the father is one of his best and he should have  received another Oscar nod.  Through Robards' father character we see how  his kids turned out the way they did.  And we see him growing and learning  as he finds you CAN teach an old dog new tricks.  Joaquin Phoenix (River's  kid brother, here billed as Leaf, as Wiest's youngest) and Helen Shaw as  Grandma, the matriarch of the family are also excellent.  Keanu Reeves  (Wiest's son-in-law) and Mary Steenburgen (Martin's wife) round out the  cast beautifully.  Randy Newman's score is perfect and the Oscar nominated  song &quot;I Love to See You Smile&quot; is very infectious.Pulling  everything together for a production of this kind is not an easy task.  When you couple that with the fact that in this movie, comedy and drama are  blended together seamlessly, Howard and his cast and crew have created a  true treasure.  Being a perfect parent is not easy.  Being a perfect person  is impossible.

Among his four children are Gil (Steve Martin), a modestly-successful though rather tightly-wound businessman with three children of his own... one of whom is a fragile eight-year-old boy who frequently breaks into hysterics --whether because he dropped a fly-ball and lost a baseball game for the team, or was simply terrified when the house blew a fuse.Buchman's other son is a complete loser and manipulator named Larry (Tom Hulce), who shows up for a family dinner after (we learn) an absence of some three-plus years. Larry carries some serious baggage, including, but not limited to a gang of mobsters who are quite interested in being paid back for a rather substantial gambling debt.Buchman's two daughters include Helen (Diane Wiest), whose own daughter played by Martha Plimpton is a high-school girl dating a house painter-cum-drag racer (Keanu Reeves), and whose 12-year-old son Gary (Leaf -now, Joaquin- Phoenix) has withdrawn into himself and his padlocked room. Buchman's other daughter Susan is married to Nathan (Rick Moranis), a PhD of some sort who turns every waking moment and event into an educational opportunity for their four-year-old daughter --a girl who consequently has no capacity to relate to other four-year-olds, but who evidently has memorized the periodic table of elements, and understands words like ""pragmatic.""One of the most priceless characters is ""Grandma"" (apparently, though never actually stated to be Jason Robards' mother). A sweet, and perceptive woman, nothing fazes her... including a scene where a hidden cache of porno flics is discovered. As she's led out of the room by her daughter, we hear her comment: ""One of those young men reminded me of your grandfather!""Grandma's monologue on rollercoasters and merry-go-rounds (and how they are an analogue for life), is one of the best moments in film... not just in THIS film, but one of the best moments in film, period.

Robards has 4 children---played by Steve Martin, Tom Hulce, Harley Jane Kozak, and Diane Wiest and all of them each have children.All have their own problems within their families and this what makes it shine. It is remarkable how you can have a whole family from the divorced parents to their 4 children and each of them have family issues that run fluently throughout the movie. Never is there a dull momement. Life is full of surprises and we basically see how each of the families cope with issues, problems and disasters. This ranges from Tom Hulce needing to settle a huge gambling debt to Steve Martin finding out from his son's school that they want to kick him out and place him in a school for special needs children.I dont want to give away too much of the movie but I will end with this....The classic moment is when the great grandmother shows up (Helen Shaw) and Susan (Harley Jane Kozak) takes her to her house while they catch Diane Weist watching a porno flick. Grandma then says, ""she needs a man, now!"" and that one of the porn actors reminds her of her (Harley Jane Kozak) grandpa got rest his soul. Sooooo funny.

Steve Martin plays Gil Buckman, a good-humored husband and father whose dissatisfaction with his own childhood makes him try all the harder to ensure the happiness and success of his own children, as his extended family struggles with their own offspring. Gil, his sisters' families and the elder Buckman's, his parents, try to find the ""right"" thing to do for their children while dealing with the demands of spouses, life's ill-timed inconveniences, their own aspirations, and each other.""Parenthood"" is a laugh-out-loud look at the perils and rewards of family. Everyone will recognize someone they know in the imperfect children, crazy relatives, and inevitable dysfunctional family member. The film's charm is its familiarity. And it's nice to see characters that don't react to every disappointment by trying to control everyone involved. The cast is wonderful. Gil, the earnest, lovable, and slightly neurotic father, is the perfect role for Steve Martin. In notable supporting roles, Jason Robards is suitably cantankerous as the family patriarch, and Keanu Reeves is affable as a flakey boyfriend. ""Parenthood"" is funny, realistic, and a great stress-reliever for anyone who has had it up to the gills with family.The DVD: Bonus features include ""Production Notes"", which is an essay about the inspiration and creation of the film, and ""Cast and Filmmakers"", which provides written bios of the director and principal cast.

Steve Martin and Rick Moranis play their husbands who each face a different crisis in their domestic affairs.  Steve Martin is uptight about his childrens' failings and is worried about his ever-shrinking family budget.  Rick Moranis plays an even more anal-rententive character who, despite his wife's pleas, doesn't want to have another child for fear that it will diminish his only daughter's phenomenal intellectual growth.

Martin gets first billing, but he is supported by a superb supporting cast. Dysfunction runs rampant among brothers, sisters, children, parents & grandparents. There is much to laugh at, and much to identify with. Martin's character declares at one point that ""life is so messy"". How true! And Mary Steenburgen's character later counters with: ""What do you want? Guarantees?"" Also so true.

""Parenthood"" (1989) is a wonderful movie dealing with LIFE in general. Messages that still speak volumes years later. Married life - showing the good and bad aspects - and then some. You'll laugh at loud at many scenes, and you may cry at others. Travel through the kids birthday parties (Steve Martin is at his best here as ""Cowboy Dan""), the kids little league games, family and house management, car trouble, the pressures of work, etc. One family's day-to-day life captured beautifully by director Ron Howard. As much as this is a good movie, the cast is equally impressive. Steve Martin in probably his finest role of the 1980's, Dianne Wiest, Jason Robards, Rick Moranis, Tom Hulce, Mary Steenbergen, and youngsters yet to star in a major motion picture - Keanu Reeves and Joaquin Phoenix. Steve Martin has put some nice family oriented movies together on his resume (""Cheaper By The Dozen"", ""Father Of The Bride"", and dare I say ""Bringing Down The House""), but ""Parenthood"" is the best.

In other words, almost none of the original theatrical image has been removed for exhibition on a 4:3 television screen.  The film negative aspect ratio was 1.37:1 (almost 4:3), and for theatrical exhibition, the image was ""matted"" (partially covered from the top down and bottom up) to produce a 1.85:1 image.  For exhibition on a 4:3 television screen, the ""mattes"" have simply been removed.  So the DVD exhibition actually shows 25.9 percent more image than the theatrical exhibition.  The movie was likely filmed this way so that the theatrical image wouldn't be butchered on television by the ""Pan&Scan"" process, and because the filmmakers didn't foresee the current state of the home video market, where consumers prefer movies presented in their theatrical aspect ratio, rather than in a ratio in which the image will fill up their 4:3 television screen (if there is a difference).  This DVD presents the movie in the aspect ratio in which the filmmakers wanted people to see it on a 4:3 television, but it does not present the movie in the aspect ratio in which the filmmakers wanted people to see it in a movie theater (for that, the DVD would have to present the movie in a ""matted widescreen"" format).

It's a star-studded ""sleeper"" film, a quiet film, filled with hilarious comedy and family dysfunction.  Frank Buckman (the fantastic Jason Robards) and Marilyn Buckman (Eileen Ryan, mother to Sean and Chris Penn) are the patriarch and matriarch of the Buckman clan.  They have four adult children; Gil Buckman (Steve Martin), Helen Buckman-Lampkin (amazing Diane Wiest), Susan Buckman-Huffner (Harley Jane Kozak) and youngest Larry Buckman (Tom Hulce).  Living with Frank and Marilyn is Grandma (my favorite character, played by Helen Shaw).Gil is married to Karen (Mary Steenburgen) and they have three children, Kevin, Taylor, and Justin.  Kevin has emotional problems and the school wants to put him in special ed.  Justin, only three, likes to butt things with his head.  Gil is an uptight businessman who thinks his father was a bad father and worries that Kevin is just like him.Helen Buckman is divorced with two children, teenager Julie (Martha Plimpton) and young Gary (a very young Joaquin Phoenix).  Julie is in love with Tod (a young Keanu Reeves) whom Helen disapproves of, and Gary is withdrawn, always walking around with a paper bag.  Their father has started a new life and is totally uninvolved with the family.Susan Buckman-Huffner is married to Nathan Huffner (the great Rick Moranis), and they have one daughter, three year old Patti.  Nathan is raising Patti as a genius daughter, educating her in math, foreign language, great literature, etc.  Susan once agreed with Nathan on how to raise children, but she worries that Patti isn't socialized and also wants another baby.Larry Buckman, the youngest, is an addicted gambler.  He's always got get-rich-quick schemes running, but passes himself off to his father as a real go-getter.  He arrives home and to the surprise of everyone brings a young child with him, named Cool, which he just found out was his son only a few months ago.  But Larry has stepped over the line and has loan sharks chasing him, threatening to kill him if he doesn't come up with their money.From the very beginning of the movie the family dysfunction is obvious.  Each family has their own problems they have to deal with.  It's the realistic problems and the realistic way they are dealt with that makes the movie interesting.  The acting is superb, and director Ron Howard does a perfect job.  This quiet, character-driven comedy is nonetheless a roller coaster ride of emotion that never slows down.  Though not action or adventure, it manages to be a riveting film that captures your attention and holds onto it.  Throughout it all, the entire family manages to maintain their love for everyone, and the movie culminates in a rather sappy but appropriate ending.Like I said, I can't really explain the reason I like this movie so much (especially me, a horror fan) but the quality of the film is undeniable.  Quirky one-liners and the tragedy/comedy mixture makes a very enjoyable story.  Worth a purchase, even for fans of other genres.

His 2 sisters, one of whom is married to a man who insists on over-educating their 4-year-old daughter with flashcards of math questions most adults couldn't answer; the other is divorced and has a 17-year-old daughter that's involved in an overdramatic relationship with her boyfriend and young teen son who's quiet and seems to be hiding something. And then, there's their parents, who shower their deadbeat youngest brother with all the attention and glory. Everyone can appreciate some aspect of this film, as everyone has a family of their own. And everyone thinks their own family is the only one that's completely nuts and offkilter...until they see the underworkings of someone else's family and realize that no family is without its' faults. This is a wonderful movie that adults and kids of a reasonable age can enjoy. It's funny yet sweet and reminds us all that if our families don't kill us, they only make us stronger. Definitely recommend!",5,The movie that proves the point that every family is nuts to a degree...,1154044800,"07 28, 2006",2006,1454,"['have', 'loved', 'movie', 'was', 'kid', 'funny', 'when', ""'re"", 'young', 'when', 'watched', 'again', 'adult', 'even', 'more', 'gem', ""'d"", 'previously', 'thought', 'movie', 'familial', 'relationships', 'centers', 'Gil', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'who', 'married', '4', 'kids', 'trying', 'work', 'way', 'corporate', 'ladder', 'provide', 'family', 'not', 'only', 'Gil', 'relationship', 'family', 'created', 'also', 'relations', 'family', '2', 'sisters', 'one', 'whom', 'married', 'man', 'who', 'over-educating', '4-year-old', 'daughter', 'flashcards', 'math', 'questions', 'most', 'adults', 'could', ""n't"", 'answer', 'other', 'divorced', '17-year-old', 'daughter', 'involved', 'overdramatic', 'relationship', 'boyfriend', 'young', 'teen', 'son', 'who', 'quiet', 'be', 'hiding', 'something', 'then', 'parents', 'who', 'shower', 'deadbeat', 'youngest', 'brother', 'attention', 'glory', 'Everyone', 'can', 'appreciate', 'aspect', 'film', 'everyone', 'family', 'own', 'everyone', 'own', 'family', 'only', 'one', 'completely', 'nuts', 'offkilter', 'see', 'underworkings', 'someone', 'else', 'family', 'realize', 'family', 'faults', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'adults', 'kids', 'reasonable', 'age', 'can', 'enjoy', 'funny', 'yet', 'sweet', 'families', 'do', ""n't"", 'kill', 'only', 'make', 'stronger', 'Definitely', 'recommend']",N/A

The movie consists of multiple scenarios as seen in Cocoon series also done by Ron Howard. Particularly I like Rick Moranis part, a father who is trying to bring up a brainy kid. The movie has traditional style of twists and dramatic upturns convincing us that our life is as dramatic as Indie Jones series. But some ending parts are so full of overproductions so I sometimes get tired. Ron should have put focus on one or two not four or five.
