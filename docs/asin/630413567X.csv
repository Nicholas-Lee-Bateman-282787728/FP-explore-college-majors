403419,A33AR9DLXB8UNW,630413567X,Kenneth Williams,"[10, 11]","First of all, I have no idea why this movie is called The Convent.  It takes place in a monastery.This is one of the most sincerely bizarre films I have ever seen.  Moodily photographed at an (real) abandoned monastery on the Portuguese coast, this chamber drama of six characters (three couples) is a throwback to the Faust and Eden stories, both at once, and seems, despite the literary and Biblical antecedents, completely fresh and unexpected, peppered with offbeat humor and framed with a sometimes mournful, sometimes terrifying musical score by the Russian composer by Sofia Gubaidulina.  (If you fall in love with the music, as I did, the pieces are called ""Officitorum"" and ""The Seven Last Words of Christ"" and both are available on CD in excellent recordings.  ""Officitorum is a LONG, wildly expressionist violin piece which ends in the more formal and haunting part showcased in the movie.)  The international cast speaks English, French and Portuguese indifferently.To people with a little patience, a sense of playfulness and an eye for the strange and beautiful, this film is a real Halloween treat.  After having watched the movie, you don't remember it so much as a movie.  You remember it more as a dream.  Days later you'll ask yourself: Did I see what I thought I saw, or am I imagining it?Frankly, I'm thrilled The Convent gotten this new inexpensive DVD release.",5,A strange little trip,1189900800,"09 16, 2007",2007,1383,"['First', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'movie', 'called', 'Convent', 'place', 'monastery.This', 'one', 'most', 'sincerely', 'bizarre', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Moodily', 'photographed', 'real', 'abandoned', 'monastery', 'Portuguese', 'coast', 'chamber', 'drama', 'six', 'characters', 'three', 'couples', 'throwback', 'Faust', 'Eden', 'stories', 'once', 'literary', 'Biblical', 'antecedents', 'completely', 'fresh', 'unexpected', 'peppered', 'offbeat', 'humor', 'framed', 'sometimes', 'mournful', 'sometimes', 'terrifying', 'musical', 'score', 'Russian', 'composer', 'Sofia', 'Gubaidulina', 'fall', 'love', 'music', 'did', 'pieces', 'are', 'called', 'Officitorum', 'Seven', 'Last', 'Words', 'Christ', 'are', 'available', 'CD', 'excellent', 'recordings', 'Officitorum', 'LONG', 'wildly', 'expressionist', 'violin', 'piece', 'more', 'formal', 'haunting', 'part', 'showcased', 'movie', 'international', 'cast', 'speaks', 'English', 'French', 'Portuguese', 'indifferently.To', 'people', 'little', 'patience', 'sense', 'playfulness', 'eye', 'strange', 'beautiful', 'film', 'real', 'Halloween', 'treat', 'having', 'watched', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'so', 'much', 'movie', 'remember', 'more', 'dream', 'later', ""'ll"", 'ask', 'Did', 'see', 'what', 'thought', 'saw', 'am', 'imagining', 'Frankly', ""'m"", 'thrilled', 'Convent', 'gotten', 'new', 'inexpensive', 'DVD', 'release']",N/A
403420,A3PQ3K5RKNJYA1,630413567X,"Pat Nava ""Patrick &#34;The Lab Rat&#34;""","[0, 2]","Of course this movie will appeal to those certain ethereal space-cadets that sit around drinking brandy and pondering the existential mind of the rat. You know something's afoot, when you enter a Convent with an upside-down Pentagram on the wall and the Munsters Uncle Fester (Baltazar) and Rosie O'Donnell (Berta) greet you. Even creepier is the super-freaky Baltar who immediately has a ""woody"" for Deneuve, and doesn't hide that fact that he's gone Ga-Ga over her; probably from the lack of women around the joint.There are these comical musical moments as Malkovich (Professor Michael Padovic) and Deneuve (Helen) approach the caves (chapels). I mean, really something out of Scooby-Doo. A particularly funny scene is when Baltazar (the lackey) recoils away from a cave and says with his back to the visitors ""This....is....the last....of the chapels"" What the heck?  The introduction of Piedade (chick) does not bode well for Malkovich. She looks like a very happy, smiling ""serial-killer.""There's the door-slamming scene between Michael and Helen which is also funny. It'll remind you of a guy watching ESPN or playing and video game; completely ignoring his wife who's trying to get his attention. You guys out there know what I'm talkin' 'bout.Strange, freaky movie that you'll enjoy with a bunch of guys getting drunk on non-alcoholic beer. Yes, we who don't understand such films are fools. But we don't walk around with our panties in a bind.",2,"Weird, freako movie.

403421,A3H9JSM1SUTE4O,630413567X,Robin Simmons,"[5, 12]","Is this some kind of inside joke?  What is going on here?  Is it about a free trip to Portugal for Malkovich and Deneuve.  This strange film has more story in the printed on-screen epilog than in the 90 preceding minutes.  Talky and long static shots.  If you look up ""PRETENTIOUS"" in the dictionary, there should be an image of this film's poster for a definition.  It would be REALLY interesting to know the circumstances of how this movie got made.  Maybe it was blackmail.  Or everyone was kidnapped and it was shot under some kind of death threat.  I can't imagine Malkovich and Deneuve read the script and agreed because of the story and I can't imagine they got big bucks because it looks like it was shot on no budget.  Maybe Satan made them do it.  But he already has a bad name.  The only Faustian thing about this movie is that it's hell to sit through.  I give it one star because it was in focus and I like the moss on one of the tree branches in a scene near the end.",1,Huh?,1187654400,"08 21, 2007",2007,981,"['kind', 'inside', 'joke', 'What', 'going', 'here', 'free', 'trip', 'Portugal', 'Malkovich', 'Deneuve', 'strange', 'film', 'more', 'story', 'printed', 'on-screen', 'epilog', '90', 'preceding', 'minutes', 'Talky', 'long', 'static', 'shots', 'look', 'up', 'PRETENTIOUS', 'dictionary', 'should', 'be', 'image', 'film', 'poster', 'definition', 'would', 'be', 'REALLY', 'interesting', 'know', 'circumstances', 'how', 'movie', 'got', 'made', 'Maybe', 'was', 'blackmail', 'everyone', 'was', 'kidnapped', 'was', 'shot', 'kind', 'death', 'threat', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'Malkovich', 'Deneuve', 'read', 'script', 'agreed', 'story', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'got', 'big', 'bucks', 'was', 'shot', 'budget', 'Maybe', 'Satan', 'made', 'do', 'already', 'bad', 'name', 'only', 'Faustian', 'thing', 'movie', 'hell', 'sit', 'give', 'one', 'star', 'was', 'focus', 'like', 'moss', 'one', 'tree', 'branches', 'scene', 'end']",N/A
403422,A14NBRS2Y9I10S,630413567X,Sarah,"[8, 16]","This movie is: incredibly pretentious, boring, confusing, and just plain stupid.  As Holden Caulfield said, ""Don't go see it unless you want to throw up all over yourself.""  Yes, it is that bad.I don't even know where to begin with the plot.  From reading the back of the case in Blockbuster, it sounded interesting.  An American professor and his beautiful French wife travel to a former convent in Portugal.  They are there to investigate a theory that Shakespeare was actually Spanish.So, it sounded interesting enough.  Plus, it starred John Malkovitch and Catherine Deneuve, so I rented it.  Big mistake.  The whole Shakespeare-plot thread isn't ever really fleshed out, and most of the movie deals with the couple's marriage.  This in itself is fine, it's just the WAY it deals with it; there are (seemingly) 10-minute-long shots of statues, hallways, etc. all set to a horrible, horrible, horrible score.  There's scenes where the couple take turns stepping outside their rooms and slamming doors.  And to cap it all off, the caretaker of the convent is actually... the devil??  Or so it would seem--we come to realize this by his psychotic, hyena-like laughter when he's hitting on Deneuve, and also by the fact that he stands in front of pentagrams.Does this sound stupid?  Well, take whatever you're imagining, and add bad lighting, and you've got ""The Convent.""",1,Avoid at all costs,1092787200,"08 18, 2004",2004,1372,"['movie', 'incredibly', 'pretentious', 'boring', 'confusing', 'just', 'plain', 'stupid', 'Holden', 'Caulfield', 'said', 'Do', ""n't"", 'go', 'see', 'want', 'throw', 'up', 'Yes', 'bad.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'where', 'begin', 'plot', 'reading', 'back', 'case', 'Blockbuster', 'sounded', 'interesting', 'American', 'professor', 'beautiful', 'French', 'wife', 'travel', 'former', 'convent', 'Portugal', 'are', 'there', 'investigate', 'theory', 'Shakespeare', 'was', 'actually', 'Spanish.So', 'sounded', 'interesting', 'enough', 'starred', 'John', 'Malkovitch', 'Catherine', 'Deneuve', 'rented', 'Big', 'mistake', 'whole', 'Shakespeare-plot', 'thread', ""n't"", 'ever', 'really', 'fleshed', 'out', 'most', 'movie', 'deals', 'couple', 'marriage', 'fine', 'just', 'WAY', 'are', 'seemingly', '10-minute-long', 'shots', 'statues', 'hallways', 'etc', 'set', 'horrible', 'horrible', 'horrible', 'score', 'scenes', 'where', 'couple', 'take', 'stepping', 'rooms', 'slamming', 'doors', 'cap', 'off', 'caretaker', 'convent', 'actually', 'devil', 'would', 'seem', 'come', 'realize', 'psychotic', 'hyena-like', 'laughter', 'when', 'hitting', 'Deneuve', 'also', 'fact', 'front', 'pentagrams.Does', 'sound', 'stupid', 'Well', 'take', ""'re"", 'imagining', 'add', 'bad', 'lighting', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Convent']",N/A
