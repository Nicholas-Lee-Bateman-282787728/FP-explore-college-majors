There's a burning tanker in the San Pedro harbor, twenty-seven dead bodies, and four other temperamental criminals involved: former cop Keaton (Byrne), explosives expert Hockney (Pollak), and the hot-headed duo McManus (Baldwin) and Fenster (Del Toro).The Usual Suspects could have gotten by on the storyline itself, but the script is funny and well-written and the acting is terrific all around, especially by Spacey and Del Toro (both in award-winning performances).

387543,A33L7G4E8CID3,6303908306,"Adam Dukovich ""colts_19""","[1, 1]","I was blown away by this film the first time that I watched it. Never before had I seen such a compellingly written crime story that becomes something more: a series of psychological mind games - the film itself becomes an entity, daring you to make preconceptions of any kind, daunting you with plot twists, strangling you with suspense, until the final card has been played and the only thought that comes into mind iswowIt is a film where nothing is as it seems, and trying to find what is real is like a dog chasing after its tail. The story, so much as can be told, is that a ship caught on fire outside San Pedro, California, and only two people survived: a Hungarian with burns covering over half of his body and Roger ""Verbal"" Kint, a cripple from New York. The events are told via flashback, Kint describing how he hooked up with hardened criminals such as Michael McManus, Todd Hockney, Fenster, and his friend Dean Keaton, an ex-cop and ex-con just wanting to play it straight. As the story unfolds, the men have to serve the will of the diabolical Keyser Soze, and the power of the film grows until the end, when we realize that the Keyser (and Chris McQuarrie) have played us for fools.This is not a movie for everyone. If in a crime story you need somebody getting whacked every minute and guns and explosives constantly, you might be a bit bored. Sure, there are all those things, but the emphasis of the movie is on its story and most of the film is dialogue. If you resent having your mind challenged and messed with, please do not apply. If you do not want to pay close attention to every scene to try to find out what's happening, some of the enjoyment might be lost. However, the beauty of The Usual Suspects is that nearly every loose end is tied up, except for one: What happened to Keyser Soze?Excellent camerawork and sound help one get into the film. But more compelling is the acting. Gabriel Byrne is phlegmatic and charismatic as Keaton, a man wanting to change but tormented by the Establishment (Keyser) and by inner demons. Stephen Baldwin plays the macho McManus, and he is utterly convincing in the role. Benicio Del Toro, in one of his earlier performances, turns the rather insignificant role of Fenster into a captivating performance, he goes over the deep end, but it works perfectly. Kevin Pollak plays Hockney, a pyrotechnic who is worried about himself only. Pollak gives a fine performance and his natural comic timing adds some levity to the plot. Kevin Spacey gives his most complex and mesmerizing role as Verbal, whose brilliance is in that he seems boring and ordinary, when, in fact, he is not. Chazz Palmintieri plays his character with both sensitivity and toughness, and pulls it off brilliantly.The extensive extras include deleted scenes (none of which really add anything to the story) a gag reel (the Keyser Soze rap song was hilarious) extensive documentaries and comentaries. Although they go through the processes of making an independent film, the director and screenwriter offer only a few insights into their craft. Alas, the film speaks louder than they could.This film is genius, pure and simple. It is one of those ""questioning reality"" movies without the laws of physics being broken and machines trying to kill humanity off. This comes highly recommended.",5,"Brilliant, Inteligent Film",1018483200,"04 11, 2002",2002,3320,"['was', 'blown', 'away', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'Never', 'had', 'seen', 'compellingly', 'written', 'crime', 'story', 'something', 'more', 'series', 'psychological', 'mind', 'games', 'film', 'entity', 'daring', 'make', 'preconceptions', 'kind', 'daunting', 'plot', 'twists', 'strangling', 'suspense', 'final', 'card', 'been', 'played', 'only', 'thought', 'mind', 'iswowIt', 'film', 'where', 'nothing', 'trying', 'find', 'what', 'real', 'dog', 'chasing', 'tail', 'story', 'so', 'much', 'can', 'be', 'told', 'ship', 'caught', 'fire', 'San', 'Pedro', 'California', 'only', 'two', 'people', 'survived', 'Hungarian', 'burns', 'covering', 'half', 'body', 'Roger', 'Verbal', 'Kint', 'cripple', 'New', 'York', 'events', 'are', 'told', 'flashback', 'Kint', 'describing', 'how', 'hooked', 'up', 'hardened', 'criminals', 'such', 'Michael', 'McManus', 'Todd', 'Hockney', 'Fenster', 'friend', 'Dean', 'Keaton', 'ex-cop', 'ex-con', 'just', 'wanting', 'play', 'straight', 'story', 'unfolds', 'men', 'have', 'serve', 'will', 'diabolical', 'Keyser', 'Soze', 'power', 'film', 'end', 'when', 'realize', 'Keyser', 'Chris', 'McQuarrie', 'have', 'played', 'fools.This', 'not', 'movie', 'everyone', 'crime', 'story', 'need', 'somebody', 'getting', 'whacked', 'minute', 'guns', 'explosives', 'constantly', 'might', 'be', 'bit', 'bored', 'Sure', 'are', 'things', 'emphasis', 'movie', 'story', 'most', 'film', 'dialogue', 'resent', 'having', 'mind', 'challenged', 'messed', 'please', 'do', 'not', 'apply', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', 'scene', 'try', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happening', 'enjoyment', 'might', 'be', 'lost', 'However', 'beauty', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'nearly', 'loose', 'end', 'tied', 'up', 'one', 'What', 'happened', 'Keyser', 'Soze', 'Excellent', 'camerawork', 'sound', 'help', 'one', 'get', 'film', 'more', 'compelling', 'acting', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'phlegmatic', 'charismatic', 'Keaton', 'man', 'wanting', 'change', 'tormented', 'Establishment', 'Keyser', 'inner', 'demons', 'Stephen', 'Baldwin', 'macho', 'McManus', 'utterly', 'convincing', 'role', 'Benicio', 'Del', 'Toro', 'one', 'earlier', 'performances', 'rather', 'insignificant', 'role', 'Fenster', 'captivating', 'performance', 'deep', 'end', 'perfectly', 'Kevin', 'Pollak', 'Hockney', 'pyrotechnic', 'who', 'worried', 'only', 'Pollak', 'fine', 'performance', 'natural', 'comic', 'timing', 'levity', 'plot', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'most', 'complex', 'mesmerizing', 'role', 'Verbal', 'brilliance', 'boring', 'ordinary', 'when', 'fact', 'not', 'Chazz', 'Palmintieri', 'character', 'sensitivity', 'toughness', 'off', 'brilliantly.The', 'extensive', 'extras', 'include', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'none', 'really', 'add', 'anything', 'story', 'gag', 'reel', 'Keyser', 'Soze', 'rap', 'song', 'was', 'hilarious', 'extensive', 'documentaries', 'comentaries', 'go', 'processes', 'making', 'independent', 'film', 'director', 'screenwriter', 'offer', 'only', 'few', 'insights', 'craft', 'Alas', 'film', 'louder', 'could.This', 'film', 'genius', 'pure', 'simple', 'one', 'questioning', 'reality', 'movies', 'laws', 'physics', 'being', 'broken', 'machines', 'trying', 'kill', 'humanity', 'off', 'highly', 'recommended']","The Usual Suspects, Letterbox Edition VHS"

I mean ""Pulp"" was so unique and original that I was so stunned when I first watched it. I couldn't believe my eyes, it was funny, violent and it wasn't meaningless either because at the end of each story there is a message of redemption. Now it brings me to ""Usual Suspects."" I didn't really know what to expect when I first watched it because it looked like it was going to be some prison movie. But I was wrong. The plot just kept twisting and turning which kept me on the edge of my seat. It was suspenseful and mysterious, the whole bit with Keyser Soze, it's gold! And the ending is what made this movie. The film truly has THE BEST ENDING in any movie ever made. I'm not gonna ruin it for those who haven't seen it.So I desperately urge all of you who haven't seen it to go out to either rent it or buy it. Buying it is good because this one is a keeper; I have a copy of it myself. It's always fun to watch it with someone who hasn't seen it just to see their reaction.

Well the plot is described in many reviews already. It is story of 5 gang men criminals who agree to blow up a ship where cocaine transaction worth 91 million takes place. The gang men do this disheartedly due to threat of someone called 'Keyser' who knows all their criminal history essentially blackmailing them. After the operation, there are only one survivor (Kevin spacey) who is given immunity after the incident.The police interrogates him about the blowup to get possible clue of the actual assassin 'Keyser Soze'. Who is this Keyser soze ? Most of the movie is flashback narration of Kevin spacey to help police find out the killer. I won't spoil the the plot further !The suspense is no doubt thrilling but somehow the story building is unconvincing. I felt more manipulated at when suspense unfolds. Why ? There are so many scenes earlier in the movie which don't make sense at all. Yet due to buildup in the beginning, we try to focus on each scene like investigators only to find that pieces don't fit. It is as if the director played a trick on us and this makes suspense uncompelling.(Moreover flashback storytelling, I was confused about the sequence of scenes in the movie). We wear investigator cap to analyze the plot and we realize most of it is useless. Also, the details leading to revelation of plot suspense is not convincing. No clues revealed at the end have relavance to the earlier plot. It is as if the director played trick by pulling the rug without any clue.My comments are probably influenced due to comparision with Sixth sense movie. The movie is probably inspiration to 'twist ending' thrillers like 'Sixth sense' movie. In Sixth sense, the dead man doesn't know he is dead and yet there is scene when suffering boy says 'I see dead people and they don't know they are dead' to the dead man itself. After the suspense, we are compelled to look back the entire plot and it is still convincing. We see many other dead people talking to the boy in many scenes. This makes sixth sense is so bold in storytelling that at the end we don't feel tricked or manipulated (although trick is played on us by Night).Entire movie seems convincing and we rewind the movie to see again.This is where 'Usual suspects' fails ! We rather feel manipulated by director. I would prefer to be watch a drama rather than a manipulative thriller.The movie however has excellent screenplay. The music score by John Ottman is hypnotic and evokes emotion to the plot. Kevin spacey is powerful actor and he does great job as crippled passive criminal !",3,Great suspense but felt manipulated !

387555,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6303908306,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 5]","I will say that `The Usual Suspects' is entertaining, because to say otherwise would be a bold faced lie.  I won't say that it was deserving of all the hype it received, because to say that would also be a bold faced lie.  No, `The Usual Suspects' is a decent crime thriller that proves to have a `twist' ending that becomes more and more predictable as you start putting pieces together.  The script is probably the best and worst thing about this movie.  When you look at all the thought that went into constructing the plot (or lack there of) you can't help but be taken aback by the effort put into it, but when all is said and done the twist at the end seems very rudimentary and the overall concept of the film lacks that freshness that could have been achieved had the envelope been pushed a little further.The film begins with a bang, or an explosion to be more precise.  A cargo ship goes up in flames and next thing you know we are brought back to how it all began, with five men standing in a lineup.  These five men include criminals Michael McManus, Fred Fenster and Todd Hockey as well as one time cop Dean Keaton and small time crook Roger Kint, also known as Verbal (because he talks to much).  After the men meet the wheels are set in motion for something much more complicated (and possibly fabricated) than anything they've been involved with before; all of which boils down to a man named Keyser Soze.The film is told in flashbacks by Verbal as he is interrogated after the ship explosion, he being the only survivor.  As Verbal weaves a thick web of truth, partial truth and absolutely no truth it is up to Dave Kujan to sort through it all to find out just who Keyser Soze really is.The acting is truly hit or miss here, and I think the misses really took the overall experience of the film down a few notches.  The only real standout is Kevin Spacey who isn't even delivering his best (his performance in `Se7en' that same year is what should have garnered him the Oscar, not this one).  Among the decent are Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollak and Chazz Postlewaite.  Stephen Baldwin is horrendous and Benicio Del Toro (an actor for which I am usually amazed by) is ridiculous here.  I understand creating a `character' and I can generally stand behind that, but his performance was so obnoxious and annoying that I loathed his presence on the screen.  Spacey at least develops a character that is interesting, and even though he has delivered much stronger performances in other films he really carries the bulk of this film on his shoulders, and the moments that do work, work because of him.The film noir style is also a bit off here.  I love a good film noir, and films like `Chinatown', `The Griffters' and the recent `Brick' really understood the concept and delivered brilliantly.  `The Usually Suspects' doesn't quite get it to the point where whole sequences come off as awkward as apposed to genuine.So a lot has been made about the `twist' that comes at the end of this film.  Some absolutely love it and stake their everlasting devotion to this film on the last few moments alone.  Others absolutely loathe it and feel that it killed the entire experience up till that point.  I'm personally torn because the `twist' comes in two parts really, and one part I find to be genius, the other I find to be a serious cop out; an easy route to take.I'm going to yell SPOILER right here so that I can't get yelled at for this and if you have not seen this movie you can stop reading right here.Having the revelation come about that the entire film up till the last few moments was a complete faade, an exaggerated fabrication of actual events, was genius.  Having the audience come to know that nothing they witnessed was actual and leaving them still scratching their heads, as was Kujan, wondering what `really' happened was just awesome in my opinion.  Having Verbal wind up being Soze was not.  I actually hate that aspect of the film.  It just feels so washed up to me, like they ran out of originality.  I guessed that Verbal was Soze about half way into the film, the moment Soze's name first came up and I was praying that the `twist' would prove me wrong.  Sadly, it didn't.  So I merely like the ending as apposed to hating or loving it.  I would probably still have nominated the screenplay since it was, for the most part, really well done, but I wouldn't have given it the Oscar.In the end I see `The Usual Suspects' as a decent thriller that entertains as best it can.  Some mediocre acting and one devastating plot blow brings the film down for me, but I can't say that it is a complete waste of time.  It ends up earning a high C, just barely under a low B.  It is good but it is missing a few key elements to reach greatness.",3,Maybe a little too usual...,1218758400,"08 15, 2008",2008,4762,"['will', 'say', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'entertaining', 'say', 'otherwise', 'would', 'be', 'bold', 'faced', 'lie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'deserving', 'hype', 'received', 'say', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'bold', 'faced', 'lie', 'No', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'decent', 'crime', 'thriller', 'have', 'twist', 'ending', 'more', 'more', 'predictable', 'start', 'putting', 'pieces', 'together', 'script', 'probably', 'best', 'worst', 'thing', 'movie', 'When', 'look', 'thought', 'went', 'constructing', 'plot', 'lack', 'there', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'taken', 'aback', 'effort', 'put', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'twist', 'end', 'very', 'rudimentary', 'overall', 'concept', 'film', 'freshness', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'achieved', 'had', 'envelope', 'been', 'pushed', 'little', 'further.The', 'film', 'bang', 'explosion', 'be', 'more', 'precise', 'cargo', 'ship', 'up', 'flames', 'next', 'thing', 'know', 'are', 'brought', 'back', 'how', 'began', 'five', 'men', 'standing', 'lineup', 'five', 'men', 'include', 'criminals', 'Michael', 'McManus', 'Fred', 'Fenster', 'Todd', 'Hockey', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'time', 'cop', 'Dean', 'Keaton', 'small', 'time', 'crook', 'Roger', 'Kint', 'also', 'known', 'Verbal', 'much', 'men', 'meet', 'wheels', 'are', 'set', 'motion', 'something', 'much', 'more', 'complicated', 'possibly', 'fabricated', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'been', 'involved', 'before', 'down', 'man', 'named', 'Keyser', 'Soze.The', 'film', 'told', 'flashbacks', 'Verbal', 'interrogated', 'ship', 'explosion', 'being', 'only', 'survivor', 'Verbal', 'thick', 'web', 'truth', 'partial', 'truth', 'absolutely', 'truth', 'Dave', 'Kujan', 'sort', 'find', 'out', 'just', 'who', 'Keyser', 'Soze', 'really', 'is.The', 'acting', 'truly', 'hit', 'miss', 'here', 'think', 'misses', 'really', 'took', 'overall', 'experience', 'film', 'down', 'few', 'notches', 'only', 'real', 'standout', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'who', ""n't"", 'even', 'delivering', 'best', 'performance', 'Se7en', 'same', 'year', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'garnered', 'Oscar', 'not', 'one', 'decent', 'are', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'Kevin', 'Pollak', 'Chazz', 'Postlewaite', 'Stephen', 'Baldwin', 'horrendous', 'Benicio', 'Del', 'Toro', 'actor', 'am', 'usually', 'amazed', 'ridiculous', 'here', 'understand', 'creating', 'character', 'can', 'generally', 'stand', 'performance', 'was', 'so', 'obnoxious', 'annoying', 'loathed', 'presence', 'screen', 'Spacey', 'least', 'develops', 'character', 'interesting', 'even', 'delivered', 'much', 'stronger', 'performances', 'other', 'films', 'really', 'bulk', 'film', 'shoulders', 'moments', 'do', 'work', 'work', 'him.The', 'film', 'noir', 'style', 'also', 'bit', 'here', 'love', 'good', 'film', 'noir', 'films', 'Chinatown', 'Griffters', 'recent', 'Brick', 'really', 'concept', 'delivered', 'brilliantly', 'Usually', 'Suspects', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', 'point', 'where', 'whole', 'sequences', 'come', 'off', 'as', 'awkward', 'apposed', 'genuine.So', 'lot', 'been', 'made', 'twist', 'end', 'film', 'absolutely', 'love', 'stake', 'everlasting', 'devotion', 'film', 'last', 'few', 'moments', 'alone', 'Others', 'absolutely', 'loathe', 'feel', 'killed', 'entire', 'experience', 'up', 'point', ""'m"", 'personally', 'torn', 'twist', 'two', 'parts', 'really', 'one', 'part', 'find', 'be', 'genius', 'other', 'find', 'be', 'serious', 'cop', 'out', 'easy', 'route', 'take.I', ""'m"", 'going', 'yell', 'SPOILER', 'right', 'here', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'yelled', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'movie', 'can', 'stop', 'reading', 'right', 'here.Having', 'revelation', 'come', 'entire', 'film', 'up', 'last', 'few', 'moments', 'was', 'complete', 'faade', 'exaggerated', 'fabrication', 'actual', 'events', 'was', 'genius', 'Having', 'audience', 'come', 'know', 'nothing', 'witnessed', 'was', 'actual', 'leaving', 'still', 'scratching', 'heads', 'was', 'Kujan', 'wondering', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'was', 'just', 'awesome', 'opinion', 'Having', 'Verbal', 'wind', 'up', 'being', 'Soze', 'was', 'not', 'actually', 'hate', 'aspect', 'film', 'just', 'feels', 'so', 'washed', 'up', 'ran', 'originality', 'guessed', 'Verbal', 'was', 'Soze', 'half', 'way', 'film', 'moment', 'Soze', 'name', 'first', 'came', 'up', 'was', 'praying', 'twist', 'would', 'prove', 'wrong', 'Sadly', 'did', ""n't"", 'So', 'merely', 'ending', 'apposed', 'hating', 'loving', 'would', 'probably', 'still', 'have', 'nominated', 'screenplay', 'was', 'most', 'part', 'really', 'well', 'done', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'given', 'Oscar.In', 'end', 'see', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'decent', 'thriller', 'can', 'mediocre', 'acting', 'one', 'devastating', 'plot', 'blow', 'film', 'down', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'complete', 'waste', 'time', 'up', 'earning', 'high', 'C', 'just', 'barely', 'low', 'B', 'good', 'missing', 'few', 'key', 'elements', 'reach', 'greatness']","The Usual Suspects, Letterbox Edition VHS"

I read some review lately and author was saying something like this: ""C'mon Hollywood, wake up, people are not that brainless"". So here's the answer I think - ""The Usual Suspects"" - really clever and shrewd film. Bryan Singer did a wonderful job here maybe because he was young and unknown. Later he released ""Apt Pupil"" - also smart movie, and then... ""X-Men"", ""X2"", now he's filming ""Superman returns"" - well, it's Hollywood after all :) Sam Raimi, Peter Jackson and many others once also were making independent interesting cinema... But it's not the point here. As I said ""The Usual Suspects"" is a smart and intelligent film and those like it are in deficit now.

Basically it starts with the end of the movie and works its way back in flashbacks as Kevin Spacey's character Verbal Kint, relays his story to the investigators.It starts when 5 small time crooks are gathered for a line-up on an arms truck theft.  They note the oddity of their being gathered for this line up, as it is rare they gather all felons for this type of thing,  but go on to consider this fortuitous, as they have a future heist that could use their combined skills. Verbal Kint the least capable of the group is only except after he talks Gabriel Byrne's character Dean Keaton, a former cop and felon, to return to his life of crime.They have some successes which embolden them to go on to some more but wind up realizing their initial pairing up, is not as innocent as it seems.A &quot;mystery&quot; figure in crimes circles Keyser Soze, through a middleman has asked them to do &quot;one final job&quot; with an incredible payoff.  It is very dangerous and not all of them are expected to survive.  Their cooperation is insured by demonstrating what happens when one of them tries to flee.  Additionally, not only they but the people important to them are in this net, to insure their cooperation.I can't provide more details without ruining the story, but it was masterful.  Kevin Spacey's acting as Verbal Kint was wonderful.

387575,A20IVL127LEW6S,6303908306,Brian Brems,"[0, 1]","The second-best crime film ever made, a completely original idea and  fabulous dircting makes The Usual Suspects what it is.  The characters  include five criminals, Dean Keton, a retired criminal who now is  romantically involved with a criminal lawyer, and they have gone into the  restaurant business together.  keton is played by Gabriel Byrne, who is  well-cast, but not as well-cast as he is in End of Days, where he plays the  devil.  Stephen Baldwin plays McManus, a loud, crazy, but effective entry  man.  He plays this sort of role to a T, but he has been type-cast for his  career thanks to his role.  Kevin Pollak plays Todd Hockney, the explosives  expert, who doesn't care about anyone.  Pollak is great at this kind of  role, and he has some great lines.  Benicio del Toro, in his breakthrough  role, is hilarious as a wisecracking criminal with a speech impediment.  The speech impediment, where he mumbles constantly, makes him hard to  understand, but it's very, very funny.  And finally, to round out the  criminals, Verbal Kint, a cripple, played by the not yet so famous Kevin  Spacey.  Kevin Spacey is awesome in this movie.  This is his best acting  job ever.  He won the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for his work, and  it is well deserved.  The opening lineup scene is a classic, and is  possibly the greatest opener ever, second only to the Diner Scene, from  Reservoir Dogs.  The story is told by Kevin Spacey, who is the sole  survivor of a mass slaughter in the San Pedro harbor, involving a ship.  The five men were sent to destroy coke on a boat by the mysteriously shifty  Keyzer Soze, who has never been seen by anyone, that has lived to tell the  tale.  Spacey is telling his account to U.S. Customs Agent David Cuyan, who  has a personal vendetta against Keton.  The movie jumps around a little,  but by the second viewing it is easy to follow.

387576,APP5MBH2BSX6I,6303908306,"Brian Hulett ""okierazorbacker2""","[2, 12]","""The Usual Suspects"" is a fascinating, convoluted, frustrating, remarkable, confusing mess of a movie.  Its incredibly complex plot is fascinating; the plot is convoluted, frequently going in a number of directions at the same time, leaving holes in the plot and gaps that are too often frustrating; is remarkable because its ending ties up the most troublesome of these; but is confusing because it leaves other questions unanswered.  Ultimately it's a case of buckshot cinema; it sprays all kinds of ideas, clues, red herrings, and misdirection, and doesn't play fair with the audience in that it drops clues and later pretends they didn't exist.  It cheats you.Oh, not that it's boring.  Not in the least.  ""The Usual Suspects"" is equal parts film noir, Agatha Christie murder mystery, and ""Reservoir Dogs"" wannabe without the great dialogue.  The film won an Oscar for best screenplay and another for Kevin Spacey's ""supporting actor"" role.  Spacey's award was well deserved; the cheating screenplay wasn't.  Check out the physically impossible moments such as putting out a fire in the film's early moments and, later, blood spattering in the wrong direction in an elevator.  Another sin committed here is the showbiz idiocy of an actor firing a handgun while holding it sideways; ask anyone familiar with handgun marksmanship and he/she will tell you that's a sure way to miss your target nearly every time.  Stupid.  Finally, and worst of all, a key character at film's end whose name is revealed as being made up on the spot even though the writers, in the previous scene, show the character's name in court records from the previous day.  Wha?Personally I don't like being lied to, and the screenplay goes beyond misdirection to out-and-out ripping you off.  Unfair.  Perhaps a more gullible (or less attentive) viewer won't notice.  It's telling that screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie has only had one other screenplay produced in the 10 years since this film was made (2000's ""The Way Of the Gun"").It's worth a look, though, partly because of how well and stylishly the finished production cheats on you.  Obviously it got away with it, for most people.  Also, continuing the obvious parallels to ""Reservoir Dogs,"" this film is far more stunning in terms of cinematography, obviously a higher budget film (I can hear McQuarrie and director Bryan Singer, who were high school buds, pitching this film to prospective producers:  ""It's an upscale 'Reservoir Dogs' with a bigger twist at the end,"" which is essentially what it is).  Also, the cast cannot be faulted, in spite of one actor who thinks he's Marlon Brando with a worse mushmouth than usual.  (Perhaps it's the character who thinks that.)  Any film with Spacey sharing extended screen time with Chazz Palmanteri is worth three stars for that alone, and Kevin Pollak & Gabriel Byrne are bonuses.  One question:  How did Stephen Baldwin sink from this to ""The Surreal Life""?""The Usual Suspects,"" ultimately, is more frustrating than most films because of how good it could have been.

It is peppered with magnificent performances, excellent direction, and a brilliant script(Which incidentally won the Oscar for Best Screenplay). Director Bryan Singer molds a tight and entertaining tale of five men, falsely brought in on charges of a stolen vehicle, then deciding to join forces and commit more crimes. What transgresses is a story of deceit, corruption and murder. Not only is the tale incredibly gripping, it is also downright hilarious at some points, making it such an enjoyable film. Kevin Spacey delivers an amazing performance as Verbal Kint, a scam artist cripple. Gabriel Byrne is great as the tough but compassionate Dean Keaton. Kevin Pollack delivers a strong and razor sharp comic relief role as Todd Hockney. One of the most surprisingly fantastic performances comes from Stephen Baldwin, who really packs a punch in this one. Benicio Del Toro gained rave reviews for his role as Fenster in this film , with due cause. Chazz Palminteri is also very intimidating as the cop trying to bring them down. This film won two Oscars, for original screenplay(Christopher McQuarrie,  can you believe this was an original?!) and very deservedly for Kevin Spacey and his awesome performance.

Their unknown leader has a history that intertwines with the whole story and unfolds in a way that will soften even those that like the hardest movies. A twistng plot and almost funny secrets that only we the audience are let in on make it very unusual.  Fans of movies like ""Snatch"" and ""Formula 51"" should enjoy it the most.

387589,A3I7OX03X6KDMN,6303908306,"Chris Roberts ""Chris Roberts""","[5, 20]","Knowing that I was behind the times I decided to catch up with ""The Usual Suspects,"" the critically acclaimed, Oscar winning film from 1995 that launched Bryan Singer's directorial career. I found it to be decent, but not worth the hype. The intricate plot involves a group of criminals who come together to pull off some kind of job on a boat. We watch, after the fact, as Verbal (Kevin Spacey) tells his version of the story to the detective. What at first appears to be a mind boggling heist turns out to be just that. Writer Christopher McQuarrie seems to want to keep his audience at a distance as the script has a very cold veneer. No characters are given any warmth and there is nothing even resembling a sense of humor. It weighs down the entire film and we are stuck taking this elaborate punking as though it were high art. The script thinks very highly of itself. But with an Oscar on its side who am I to argue?The film would probably be best enjoyed by those who like nice, intriguing capers, but it is not my cup of tea. All the trappings of an overly complicated plot are here, only it provides no real pay off in the end. Well there is a pay off that is explained in the shocking twist ending, but it is so forced that you will be forgiven for feeling played. There are no hints and no warning signs so that when the rug does get pulled out for under you the only thing that it results in is a sore rear end. If we wanted to we could look at this film and say that it serves as a celebration of storytelling, but if that is what it wanted to be then it should have tried harder at telling its own story.  And it is not just the lack of playfulness that bugged me (though for the record I'll take ""Ocean's 11"" over this any day), but also my inability to be drawn into these characters in this situation. I'm certainly not going to blame the actors, Kevin Spacey and Gabriel Byrne are especially on target. No, something was missing, and my instincts tell me that it was humanity.It is interesting that this is what started Singer's career, a career devoted pretty much to men who fly. Take the character Keyser Soze for instance. Here is a man who would fit right in on one of Marvel's pages. He's shadowy and stalks through the night striking terror in the hearts of many. Of course the myth is bigger than the man, but the build up is done quite well. As is a lot of this film, and I really have no intentions of dumping on it. The pacing is smooth in that it keeps everything going but never threatens whiplash. And for all my qualms with the story I was interested to see how it turned out. What story was true? What was on the boat? What were the usual suspects actually doing there? And so it goes and that is the fun to be had. All caper movies have a twist ending, and as I mentioned earlier so does this one. I was just hoping that it would have been a tiny bit more creative than the whole, ""Let's take the least likely ending possible and make that our ending"" bit. A for effort, but no recommendation from me. ***",3,Up To No Good,1166832000,"12 23, 2006",2006,3041,"['Knowing', 'was', 'times', 'decided', 'catch', 'up', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'film', '1995', 'launched', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'directorial', 'career', 'found', 'be', 'decent', 'not', 'hype', 'intricate', 'plot', 'group', 'criminals', 'who', 'come', 'together', 'pull', 'off', 'kind', 'job', 'boat', 'watch', 'fact', 'Verbal', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'version', 'story', 'detective', 'What', 'first', 'be', 'mind', 'boggling', 'heist', 'out', 'be', 'just', 'Writer', 'Christopher', 'McQuarrie', 'want', 'keep', 'audience', 'distance', 'script', 'very', 'cold', 'veneer', 'characters', 'are', 'given', 'warmth', 'nothing', 'even', 'resembling', 'sense', 'humor', 'down', 'entire', 'film', 'are', 'stuck', 'taking', 'elaborate', 'punking', 'were', 'high', 'art', 'script', 'very', 'highly', 'Oscar', 'side', 'who', 'am', 'argue', 'film', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'best', 'enjoyed', 'who', 'nice', 'intriguing', 'capers', 'not', 'cup', 'tea', 'trappings', 'overly', 'complicated', 'plot', 'are', 'here', 'only', 'real', 'pay', 'off', 'end', 'Well', 'pay', 'off', 'explained', 'shocking', 'twist', 'ending', 'so', 'forced', 'will', 'be', 'forgiven', 'feeling', 'played', 'are', 'hints', 'warning', 'signs', 'so', 'when', 'rug', 'get', 'pulled', 'out', 'only', 'thing', 'results', 'sore', 'rear', 'end', 'wanted', 'could', 'look', 'film', 'say', 'celebration', 'storytelling', 'what', 'wanted', 'be', 'then', 'should', 'have', 'tried', 'harder', 'telling', 'own', 'story', 'not', 'just', 'lack', 'playfulness', 'bugged', 'record', ""'ll"", 'take', 'Ocean', '11', 'day', 'also', 'inability', 'be', 'drawn', 'characters', 'situation', ""'m"", 'certainly', 'not', 'going', 'blame', 'actors', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'are', 'especially', 'target', 'No', 'something', 'was', 'missing', 'instincts', 'tell', 'was', 'humanity.It', 'interesting', 'started', 'Singer', 'career', 'career', 'devoted', 'pretty', 'much', 'men', 'who', 'fly', 'Take', 'character', 'Keyser', 'Soze', 'instance', 'Here', 'man', 'who', 'would', 'fit', 'right', 'one', 'Marvel', 'pages', 'shadowy', 'stalks', 'night', 'striking', 'terror', 'hearts', 'many', 'course', 'myth', 'bigger', 'man', 'build', 'up', 'done', 'quite', 'well', 'As', 'lot', 'film', 'really', 'have', 'intentions', 'dumping', 'pacing', 'smooth', 'everything', 'going', 'never', 'whiplash', 'qualms', 'story', 'was', 'interested', 'see', 'how', 'turned', 'out', 'What', 'story', 'was', 'true', 'What', 'was', 'boat', 'What', 'were', 'usual', 'actually', 'doing', 'there', 'fun', 'be', 'had', 'caper', 'movies', 'have', 'twist', 'ending', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'so', 'one', 'was', 'just', 'hoping', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'tiny', 'bit', 'more', 'creative', 'whole', 'Let', 'take', 'least', 'likely', 'ending', 'possible', 'make', 'ending', 'bit', 'effort', 'recommendation', '***']","The Usual Suspects, Letterbox Edition VHS"

387592,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,6303908306,"Cloud ""...""","[5, 5]","Sometimes what happens with a film is that one thing tends to define it without acknowledgeing the rest of it. Many people remember Usual Suspects but most of them will usually just go ""yeah that ending rocked!"" without saying anything about the rest of them movie. Well before the X-Men and upcoming Superman, Bryan Singer made this film, a film that is better than that one little scene at the end by itself.Verbal Kint is telling a story about how a boat got attacked and near 30 people were dead. In his story we meet 5 criminals who are called in about a robbery. There in lock up they meet, and decide to team up and take on some jobs. Verbal, McManus, Finster, Keaton and Hockney do some small jobs until a lawyer comes up to them and mentions a difficult job and the one wanting it done is Keyzer Soze, a legendary killer if there ever was one. So the question is who is it and does he even exist.Usual Suspects was one of those kind of slow burner films where it didn't make much money but it did garner 2 Oscars, one for Kevin Spacey and one for Screenplay. Then the greatness kicked in where everyone saw how good it was and it became one of the 90's best films. Most of that was probably due to word of mouth about the twist ending which is as shocking as it is familiar so it's actually been parodied a number of times, including Scary Movie and even Dr Doolittle.What makes the film work is not only the direction, score and the acting but it's a very sharply written story. Extra attention needs to be paid and in many scenes required repeated viewing to make sense of it. While the ending to some might cheapen the film, it works given the context. It's also very fascinating to watch the film; even though the film might have a leisurely pace, it never gets boring or makes you getting antsy.Currently #16 on IMDB's list, it's one of those films where people will outright hate it because they didn't get it or praise it for its complex narrative. I'm the latter and it's a film that definately deserves a buy.",5,One of the best crime dramas in recent memory,1142294400,"03 14, 2006",2006,2027,"['Sometimes', 'what', 'film', 'one', 'thing', 'define', 'acknowledgeing', 'rest', 'Many', 'people', 'remember', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'most', 'will', 'usually', 'just', 'go', 'yeah', 'ending', 'rocked', 'saying', 'anything', 'rest', 'movie', 'Well', 'X-Men', 'upcoming', 'Superman', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'made', 'film', 'film', 'better', 'one', 'little', 'scene', 'end', 'itself.Verbal', 'Kint', 'telling', 'story', 'how', 'boat', 'got', 'attacked', 'near', '30', 'people', 'were', 'dead', 'story', 'meet', '5', 'criminals', 'who', 'are', 'called', 'robbery', 'lock', 'meet', 'decide', 'team', 'up', 'take', 'jobs', 'Verbal', 'McManus', 'Finster', 'Keaton', 'Hockney', 'do', 'small', 'jobs', 'lawyer', 'up', 'mentions', 'difficult', 'job', 'one', 'wanting', 'done', 'Keyzer', 'Soze', 'legendary', 'killer', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'question', 'who', 'even', 'exist.Usual', 'Suspects', 'was', 'one', 'kind', 'slow', 'burner', 'films', 'where', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'money', 'did', 'garner', '2', 'Oscars', 'one', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'one', 'Screenplay', 'Then', 'greatness', 'kicked', 'where', 'everyone', 'saw', 'how', 'good', 'was', 'became', 'one', '90', 'best', 'films', 'Most', 'was', 'probably', 'due', 'word', 'mouth', 'twist', 'ending', 'as', 'shocking', 'familiar', 'actually', 'been', 'parodied', 'number', 'times', 'including', 'Scary', 'Movie', 'even', 'Dr', 'Doolittle.What', 'film', 'work', 'not', 'only', 'direction', 'score', 'acting', 'very', 'sharply', 'written', 'story', 'Extra', 'attention', 'needs', 'be', 'paid', 'many', 'scenes', 'required', 'repeated', 'viewing', 'make', 'sense', 'ending', 'might', 'cheapen', 'film', 'given', 'context', 'also', 'very', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'film', 'even', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'leisurely', 'pace', 'never', 'boring', 'getting', 'antsy.Currently', '16', 'IMDB', 'list', 'one', 'films', 'where', 'people', 'will', 'outright', 'hate', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'praise', 'complex', 'narrative', ""'m"", 'latter', 'film', 'definately', 'buy']","The Usual Suspects, Letterbox Edition VHS"

One lesser reason the film is good is the surprise ending, which is a shocker and comes at you from out of nowhere.  However, I don't think the movie depends completely on the ending; it works regardless.  In fact, I don't think the ending is all that great, for reasons I will mention later.The story centers around a supposed drug bust gone bad.  Roughly 90 million dollars worth of narcotics were on a ship and a group of notorious criminals were assembled to get the money.  The very beginning of the film shows that things got out of hand and the boat actually exploded, with practically all people in the vicinity being killed.The criminals were chosen by a character named Keyser Sose (so-say) who is so renowned for his criminal actions that the mere mention of his name brings panic and fear.  We see a flashback of his cold blooded nature: when thieves took over his house and threatened his family, he walked in calmly, shot his family first, and then shot the bad guys.  The implication is that he will kill instantly and without remorse.  He is almost mythical, no one has ever seen him and lived to tell it, and some don't even believe in his existence.  All five criminals (played by Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollack, Kevin Spacey, Benicio del Torro, and Stephen Baldwin) have done something to hurt Sose in the past, and so this is their chance to redeem themselves.  The cast is great, all bring the proper amount of intensity to their roles.After the explosion, only Verbal (Spacey) is left.  He is brought in for questioning, given immunity for his information, and on his way out the door, answers a few more questions for Agent Kujay (Chazz Palminteri), where he talks about the whole situation.  We only see what happened through Verbal's eyes.  In this way, the movie is like the classic Rashomon or the more recent and much less effective Basic, where we see information through the eyes of one very closely involved.  How much of what we see is the truth is the real mystery.The ending is a surprise, and very well done, but I don't think the movie gave enough clues in order for us as viewers to figure it out.  In that sense, it almost cheats a little, because it's easy to fool someone when you don't give them a chance to solve the riddle.  Even keeping that in mind, though, this movie is one of the better mystery thrillers I have seen in some time.",5,And like that...he's gone,1069200000,"11 19, 2003",2003,2443,"['Usual', 'Suspects', 'very', 'effective', 'movie', 'several', 'reasons', 'One', 'lesser', 'reason', 'film', 'good', 'surprise', 'ending', 'shocker', 'nowhere', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'completely', 'ending', 'regardless', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'ending', 'great', 'reasons', 'will', 'mention', 'later.The', 'story', 'centers', 'supposed', 'drug', 'bust', 'gone', 'bad', '90', 'million', 'dollars', 'worth', 'narcotics', 'were', 'ship', 'group', 'notorious', 'criminals', 'were', 'assembled', 'get', 'money', 'very', 'beginning', 'film', 'things', 'got', 'hand', 'boat', 'actually', 'exploded', 'practically', 'people', 'vicinity', 'being', 'killed.The', 'criminals', 'were', 'chosen', 'character', 'named', 'Keyser', 'Sose', 'so-say', 'who', 'so', 'renowned', 'criminal', 'actions', 'mere', 'mention', 'name', 'panic', 'fear', 'see', 'flashback', 'cold', 'blooded', 'nature', 'when', 'thieves', 'took', 'over', 'house', 'threatened', 'family', 'walked', 'calmly', 'shot', 'family', 'first', 'then', 'shot', 'bad', 'guys', 'implication', 'will', 'kill', 'instantly', 'remorse', 'almost', 'mythical', 'one', 'ever', 'seen', 'lived', 'tell', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'believe', 'existence', 'five', 'criminals', 'played', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'Kevin', 'Pollack', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Benicio', 'del', 'Torro', 'Stephen', 'Baldwin', 'have', 'done', 'something', 'hurt', 'Sose', 'past', 'so', 'chance', 'redeem', 'cast', 'great', 'bring', 'proper', 'amount', 'intensity', 'roles.After', 'explosion', 'only', 'Verbal', 'Spacey', 'left', 'brought', 'questioning', 'given', 'immunity', 'information', 'way', 'door', 'few', 'more', 'questions', 'Agent', 'Kujay', 'Chazz', 'Palminteri', 'where', 'whole', 'situation', 'only', 'see', 'what', 'happened', 'Verbal', 'eyes', 'way', 'movie', 'classic', 'Rashomon', 'more', 'recent', 'much', 'less', 'effective', 'Basic', 'where', 'see', 'information', 'eyes', 'one', 'very', 'closely', 'involved', 'How', 'much', 'what', 'see', 'truth', 'real', 'mystery.The', 'ending', 'surprise', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'gave', 'enough', 'clues', 'order', 'viewers', 'figure', 'out', 'sense', 'almost', 'little', 'easy', 'fool', 'someone', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'chance', 'solve', 'riddle', 'Even', 'keeping', 'mind', 'though', 'movie', 'one', 'better', 'mystery', 'thrillers', 'have', 'seen', 'time']","The Usual Suspects, Letterbox Edition VHS"

387605,A23GFTVIETX7DS,6303908306,Debbie Lee Wesselmann,"[3, 4]","""The Usual Suspects"" twists, turns, charms, and delivers a wallop of a twist, making this thriller one of the more memorable films of the 1990s.  Kevin Spacey plays the club-footed, meek con man Verbal who is under intense interrogation by the police for his role in an armed robbery.  As he cracks and begins to reveal the intricacies of what happened, the viewer plunges into the story along with Verbal's interrogators.  What seemed simple to the police is at first is anything but, especially when the mysterious and dangerous Keyser Soze becomes involved.This stylish, postmodern film is driven by two conflicts:  the complex crime devised by the band of ""usual suspects ((Stephen Baldwin, Benicio del Toro, Kevin Pollack, Gabriel Byne, and Spacey) and the central mystery: Who is Keyser Soze, and why does everyone fear him?  The acting is superb, with Spacey and Byrne turning in especially fine performances.

387610,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,6303908306,Dennis Littrell,"[5, 5]","The title might suggest a comedic takeoff on a crime thriller employing some sophisticated shtick or maybe we're in for something like Danny DeVito in ""Throw Mama from the Train.""  But this is not a comedy.  It is not exactly your usual crime thriller either.  It is an unconscious parody of crime thrillers with some curious depth replete with corrupt cops, shadowy off screen sinister villains and pathetic low lifes.Although I don't think director Bryan Singer and his high school pal and collaborator, scriptwriter Christopher McQuarrie, had the slightest intention toward burlesque, I was again and again struck by an unconscious underlying tone of parody.  The title is the tip off.""Round up the usual suspects"" is a line from Casablanca (1942), as most movie buffs know.  Claude Rains, as Captain Renault, head of the police in Casablanca, says ""round up the usual suspects"" more as an indication of local Moroccan justice than as a real order.  It is just the sort of cynically ironic line that would inspire Singer and McQuarrie to dream up this exceedingly cynical, but bordering on the funny, flick.While Casablanca was a bittersweet love story, ""The Usual Suspects"" is anything but.  The cast is decidedly and deliberately all male with only Suzy Amis in a minor role as Edie Finneran to interfere with the macho lineup of crooks, cops and shady sinister types.  The movie features Stephen Baldwin (Mike McManus), Gabriel Bryne (Dean Keaton), Benicio Del Toro (Fred Fenster), Chazz Palminteri (Dave Kujan), Kevin Pollak (Todd Hockney), and stars Kevin Spacey as Verbal Kint.  These guys are all excellent actors who together create a kind mass energy that propels the film.  In more ways than one I am reminded of Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs (1992) and David Mamet's Glengarry Glen Ross (1992) (movie directed by James Foley).  Consider these similarities:In both Glengarry and The Usual Suspects you have a virtually all male cast who sling expletives at one another in an ""at your throat"" style.  In both Reservoir Dogs and The Usual Suspects you have five crooks thrown together to do a job, and again everything is exceedingly macho with threats and expletives flying around like water in a hurricane.  In all three films the cast is outstanding, with Al Pacino, Jack Lemon, Ed Harris, Alex Baldwin, Kevin Spacey and Alan Arkin leading the cast in Glengarry, and Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi doing the same in Reservoir Dogs.  These guys are not your run of the mill actors.  They are the kind of guys that star in kick butt movies.  They know how to look and act authentic.But an even more startling way to compare The Usual Suspects with Glengarry and Reservoir Dogs is in the dialogue.  In all three movies the dialogue is preciously wrought with an emphasis on sounding just a little different.  In Reservoir Dogs Tarantino sometimes makes the characters sound like they are spouting Shakespeare, and in Glengarry Glen Ross Mamet has them playing verbal hijinks like machine gun chatter in an experimental stage play.  Here Singer and McQuarrie (his script won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay) employ a lot of the same rapid fire, seemingly authentic vernacular interspersed with theatrical sounding speech especially in the case of Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite) who calmly calls everybody ""Mister"" like an English butler.  And of course Verbal is very verbal and able to spout lines like, ""The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world that he didn't exist.""Keep that line in mind as you watch, and ask yourself who plays Keyser Soze, the devil incarnate, so to speak.  And pay attention to references to Skokie, Illinois.  That will help to unravel the plot.  The ending contains a nicely set up surprise.Currently rated #17 at IMDb, The Usual Suspects is the sort of cult favorite beloved by young males fascinated with testosterone-hyped action, macho-inspired dialogue and devil man care anti-heroics.  But it's a little better than that.  And clearly this is not a chick flick, and therein lies a problem.  While most males will at least find this interesting, many females will just shake their heads at how obvious is the seduction of the targeted audience.  Personally I thought the movie was a laugh.  I actually laughed out loud at some of the theatrics and grinned with appreciation at how surely Singer had captured the mentality of the targeted audience while bonding with it.  But I have to say (for those directors, writers and producers who would like to do half as well), you can't fake it.  Tarantino and Singer and others have been able to pull this sort of thing off because they really believe in the psychology.  They really believe there are tough guys who say ""f-you"" even with a gun shoved in their face, and there really are guys who see the world in a kind of cops/robbers, good guy/bad guy, buddy/rat persona world.  And there's some truth to it.Spacey won a supporting actor Oscar playing Verbal Kint, a kind of crippled loser, it would seem. He should have won Best Actor, he was that good and he was the heart of the film and the guy with whom the audience most identified.  He is the seeming loser, the little guy, the underdog who turns out to be smarter and tougher than anybody else.  I think that is what the targeted audience really loves about this movie.Bottom line: a must see for anybody interested in the history of the American cinema and in the evolution of the mystery/thriller/noir genre.  A few academic dissertations have been and will be written on how the cinematic hero has evolved from, say, Tom Mix to Verbal Kint.  You might want to write one yourself.",4,Testosterone thriller cleverly done,1170288000,"02 1, 2007",2007,5672,"['title', 'might', 'suggest', 'comedic', 'takeoff', 'crime', 'thriller', 'employing',

387611,AZ1H3VLCDR298,6303908306,Derrick Thomas,"[2, 3]","I can't think of a much better film than the Usual Suspects. It combines incredible acting talent, riveting script, and direction that is remininsce of the classic thrillers of the 40's and 50's. Bryan Singer does a terrific job as the director, and Christopher McQuarrie's script is something all hopeful screenplay writers aspire to accomplish. The script won the Oscar, as well as Kevin Spacey, for Best Supporting Actor.Kevin Spacey is a crippled ex-con who is brought into the police station after a boat full of 90 million dollars of drugs is blown up, along with several people. He then proceeds to tell the police what happened the past several weeks. A group of felons, including Spacey, is brought together for a lineup one night after a cop truck is hijacked, with all of it's illegal guns aboard missing. With no evidence, the police let them go. But the five men hatch a scheme to get even with the cops, resulting in a payoff for them, and a big ... for the cops. This scene is terrific, with the men taking money from a police &quot;Taxi&quot; service, and many officers indicted on transporting criminals in their squad cars for profit. This scheme shows how well the five work together, and sets up the rest of the movie.Spacy then tells the cops that they went to California to lay low for awhile, until a much bigger caper appealed to them. I won't go into further details, but let me tell you that the intermix of scenes of Spacey's narrative and the story he tells is perfectly done. And you have to see the mind-blowing ending. The Usual Suspects is a great film, and I have high hopes that you'll enjoy it to. As for the DVD release, it comes with director's commentary and full/screen/wide options, but it only has Dolby Digital 2.0, so you won't get the full digital sound.

387614,A2198FZZMTJ38H,6303908306,D. Litton,"[6, 14]","Confusion remains the common denominator in &quot;The Usual Suspects,&quot; in which director Bryan Singer and writer Christopher McQuarrie are determined to create a fresh and inviting thriller, but come up empty. The star-studded cast is a delight to watch, but the film is so fixated on its own cleverness and originality that it quickly loses interest, deadening the impact of a surprise twist ending that may have worked had it had a better lead-up. Perhaps what makes the film so cumbersome is its shift from past to present, and vice-versa. Beginning with an explosion aboard a ship on which a shootout has just occurred, the movie then shifts back six weeks to the arrest of five men, all accused of stealing a van full of weaponry. Four of the men, Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Fred Fenster (Benicio del Toro), Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollack), and Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey), concoct a plan of revenge against the NYPD, and the hesitant Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne) joins in. After a deluge of plot twists and scenarios that seem completely out of place, the group finds themselves on the West Coast, at the mercy of a well-known man by the name of Keyser Soze, whose lawyer gives each of them a file documentation of their lives as watched by Soze. The motive: each of them has wronged Soze at some point in the past, and their chance for repentance comes with the raid on a cocaine deal set to go down in three days. All of this is narrated and seen in the mind of Kint, played with a fiendish glee by Kevin Spacey, who turns in a well-rounded performance. The rest of the cast also leave lasting impressions: Stephen Baldwin makes a great all-around bad boy, Benicio del Toro is increasingly witty, Kevin Pollack is the ideal picture of gruff and uneasy, and Gabriel Byrne instills in his character a growing sense of unease. But their talents are ultimately cast into a lost cause. &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; manipulates its viewers to the end, taking us where only it wants to go, leaving no room for speculation or thought on the events at hand. It does this by throwing so much at the audience at once that the fear of missing out on something intrical to the overall plot becomes unbearable. In trying to think about what was going on, and watching each scene with full concentration, I almost went mad. In effect, the ending to Christopher McQuarrie's screenplay has little impact. You will be surprised at the movie's final turn of events, but the material prior to it lacks enough interest or even coherence to give the twist any logical sense. To me, the ending seems more like a blind leap towards greatness than a satisfying payoff to the film's convoluted script.

The framework around which the action is set is the interrogation of Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey), a con man, who has been granted immunity from prosecution and who tells customs agent Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) what appears to be the story leading up to the fire and explosion on a boat in San Pedro Bay the night before, an explosion that killed all but two people on board.The story of the events prior to the explosion take place through a series of flashbacks, as Kint describes these events in detail, beginning with a seemingly random meeting of five small-time criminals at a police lineup five weeks earlier. Much of the mystery surrounding the story involves a supposed mastermind named Keyser S&ouml;se, whose very name creates fear in those who hear it. Throughout Kint's story we are led to believe that no one is quite sure whether S&ouml;se even exists.This movie has great acting (in addition to Palminteri and Spacey, Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne, Benicio del Toro, and Pete Postlethwaite also have prominent roles) and flawless directing by Bryan Singer. It is gripping throughout, moves at precisely the right pace, and is complex enough that one never figures out to the end who S&ouml;se really is.This is one movie worth watching twice, once to follow the action and once to go back and see what hints were given along the way to prepare us for the conclusion.",5,An unusual film,1399075200,"05 3, 2014",2014,1448,"['34', 'Usual', 'Suspects', '34', 'say', 'least', 'intriguing', 'framework', 'action', 'set', 'interrogation', 'Verbal', 'Kint', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'con', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'granted', 'immunity', 'prosecution', 'who', 'customs', 'agent', 'Dave', 'Kujan', 'Chazz', 'Palminteri', 'what', 'be', 'story', 'leading', 'up', 'fire', 'explosion', 'boat', 'San', 'Pedro', 'Bay', 'night', 'before', 'explosion', 'killed', 'two', 'people', 'board.The', 'story', 'events', 'prior', 'explosion', 'take', 'place', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'Kint', 'events', 'detail', 'beginning', 'seemingly', 'random', 'meeting', 'five', 'small-time', 'criminals', 'police', 'lineup', 'five', 'weeks', 'earlier', 'Much', 'mystery', 'surrounding', 'story', 'supposed', 'mastermind', 'named', 'Keyser', 'S', 'ouml', 'very', 'name', 'creates', 'fear', 'who', 'hear', 'Kint', 'story', 'are', 'led', 'believe', 'one', 'quite', 'sure', 'S', 'ouml', 'even', 'exists.This', 'movie', 'great', 'acting', 'addition', 'Palminteri', 'Spacey', 'Stephen', 'Baldwin', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'Benicio', 'del', 'Toro', 'Pete', 'Postlethwaite', 'also', 'have', 'prominent', 'roles', 'flawless', 'directing', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'gripping', 'moves', 'precisely', 'right', 'pace', 'complex', 'enough', 'one', 'never', 'out', 'end', 'who', 'S', 'ouml', 'really', 'is.This', 'one', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'twice', 'once', 'follow', 'action', 'once', 'go', 'back', 'see', 'what', 'hints', 'were', 'given', 'way', 'prepare', 'conclusion']","The Usual Suspects, Letterbox Edition VHS"

387620,A9CKMSQ6ZEWLB,6303908306,D. Rodgers,"[4, 4]","In 1995 the Oscar for Best Picture went to Mel Gibson's Braveheart.  I thought it should have gone to Ron Howard's Apollo 13, but the REAL film that should have won wasn't even nominated; Bryan Singer's The Usual Suspects, which was nominated for only two Academy Awards (best supporting actor and best original screenplay), which it both won.  Here we have a fast paced, confusing ""hall-of-mirrors"" crime-noir/thriller that's loaded with great performances from an ensemble cast, a great score and a whooping of a twist ending that's quite literally jaw-dropping.  This is a film that's truly memorable and deserves to be a classic.The film starts off with what looks like five random criminals being brought in because of a bogus truck robbery.  The five men then plan to get back at the cops by uncovering a corrupt service the police were providing to certain high-paying criminals.  These five ""usual suspects"" grow closer to one another, coming together to pull off another job in L.A. which is where things start to get sticky.  They end up getting involved with a sinister crime lord that no one seems to have ever seen or met, named Keyser Soze.  Is Keyser real or is he just a figment of someone's imagination?  The more the jig-saw puzzle pieces seem to be coming together, the more the whole puzzle starts to change and fall apart.You'll think you're on top of it all, but eventually the rug will be pulled out from beneath your feet.  The film does an excellent job of playing with your mind, and at the same time convincing you that you think you know what's going on, but it's not until the final ten minutes that you'll start to be able to pull back and look at the big picture and realize that you've been had.  My hats off to director Bryan Singer (who later went on to bigger fame with 2000's X-Men) and writer Christopher McQuarrie for keeping all of this not only surprising, but fun, and exciting, without ever becoming too complicated or too confusing.  But a lot of praise should also go to the fine cast as well, including Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollak, Chazz Palminteri, Benicio Del Toro, Pete Postlethwaite and a really knockout performance from Kevin Spacey, which earned him an Oscar for the role of Verbal.If you haven't already seen The Usual Suspects by now I highly recommend you go out and buy the special edition DVD right now, don't think about renting it, you'll just end up buying it later any way.

And I think I always will have an affection for it, because despite not being as amazing as I thought, it is a genuinely smart and cool movie, nearly perfect within its own niche.The 'usual suspects' are a group of career criminals rounded up to take some heat for a truck heist. Notable among them are Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), a corrupt cop attempting to return to the straight and narrow, and Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey), a crippled con-man. To make the best of a bad situation they plan a few jobs together. However, they quickly find themselves falling deeper and deeper into a web of violence woven by the mysterious master criminal Keyser Soze, who demands payment from all of them for past misdoings. Their story is told in flashback by Verbal to a zealous customs agent the morning after a disastrous attack on a ship in the harbour leaves him the only survivor.I believe that the statutory limitation on spoilers must have been passed by now, but be warned if you continue reading.A few people seem to see this as a standard crime caper with a twist ending, and one that means that the whole story does not make much sense. But it's not really about the story, it's about the fabrication of the story and what it says about the ego of the one telling the tale. The ending deconstructs the slick pretensions of 'cool' crime movies. The evil of Keyser Soze is revealed in the way he tells his own story. To his mind crime is a flashy world of wit, legendary figures, tragic decisions and ruthless exercise of the will. If you pay attention to the details of the story that must be taken to be accurate, they actually paint a picture of a sociopath who uses people and then brutally kills them.

This is without a doubt an amazingly great screenplay.  It makes the film.  While it does borrow from old films from time to time, it is just so well done.  Good job, screenwriter! You got my vote for Eileen's Oscars as the Academy sometimes doesn't know what they are talking about.The Acting - Totally awesome acting here.  Kevin Spacey, hands down, is the best actor around right now.  The rest of the cast is excellent.  Kudos to Chazz Palminteiri!! He is very convincing as the cop.  I love when he goes off on Verbal Kent about who Kaiser Sose really is. Little does he know...The Plot -- This is a great story.  The first time you see it, you will not be sure who Kaiser Sose really is. I knew, but my husband begged to differ.The ending  -- One of the BEST ENDINGS of a movie ever!!

Well I'll tell you - owning the special edition on DVD. The special features on here are probably equal to the length of the movie itself, and offer really great insight into the director, editor, and cast. Extensive interviews with the key players reveal inside information that is fascinating. The gag reel is hysterical, and the bit of Del Torro ""getting stuck on words"" as Fenster alone is worth the price of the entire disc. The deleted scenes aren't as interesting as I'd hoped - I think the crew did a great job selecting what got left out.The plot is wonderful, involving a small crew of big- and small-time criminals and con-men who must work together to repay their individual debts to a mysterious man named Keyser Soze. Soze is a legend (some even say a myth,) whom many people believe to be the devil himself. He is ruthless, brutal, powerful and hugely successful. Pete Postlethewaite plays a wonderful attache for Mr. Soze, carrying off a bizarre combination of careful politeness edged by steely resolve. There aren't enough accolades for this whole cast, though - each actor does an incredible job of getting into his character's skin, and each man makes the viewer believe that he feels each and every little tic and itch his character would feel.The first time I saw this film, I confess that I was had - I honestly didn't know how it would end until The Big Reveal. I suspect it'll keep most people guessing. Even then, after knowing how it ends, watching it over and over again is still enjoyable, simply because of the details and hints to the truth one picks up. Plus, the characters are so engaging, and the chemistry between all of them works so well, it's just a supremely enjoyable ride every time.

387645,A3IKBHODOTYYHM,6303908306,"fra7299 ""fra7299""","[0, 1]","The final climactic moment in The Usual Suspects is the vehicle by which this movie is mostly either worshipped or despised bitterly. Depending on how you see it, we either feel cheated about such a bizarre, seemingly impossible ending, or amazed at the curve ball thrown at us, under our noses the entire time. We may even wonder if this ending is proper etiquette, or ""fair game, for a suspense to employ. Some may have seen it coming, but to those who didn't, it makes for one great surprise.As odd as it may sound, I don't think that you can judge this movie on acting alone. Sure, Kevin Spacey does an exceptional job as Verbal Kint, who is interrogated by Detective Kujan. And Gabriel Byrnne does a commendable performance as Keating, a corrupt cop supposedly trying to steer right, but who gets back into the mix. Some of the performances aren't fantastic, but this is one time where I don't think they have to be. The method of getting to the story's climax is what ""makes"" this suspense fantastic. With the use of going back in forth in time, from the present in the detective's office where Kint is telling his story, to the past, where we not only learn about the five thugs who decide to the take the big job for Keyser Soze, to learning about each one of the five. There are some plot events that you will naturally look back to as ""aha"" moments. You can credit the screen writers for coming up with this; a creative job of making this work, which usually doesn't work in movies, or ends up sloppy.In many respects, the mystery surrounding Keyser Soze is what makes this puzzle a little more than the average mystery. As you watch the film, it is actually this character, real or fake, that derives much of the motivation for actions of the thieves, such as their decision to take the big job on the boat. Soze is one of the worst villains of the film, and yet, much of the film you are trying to figure out if the infamous killer is more man or more myth.

That a group of people can come up with a piece of fiction that is so excellent in every way, from start to finish, is frightening. Who knows, maybe this film has no superior.A lot is made of the film's ending. Not for a moment am I going to let slip what exactly that is. I would never deny another film lover the sheer sense of amazement that ran through my body when the film reached its climax. While not the film's only strong point; this is a masterpiece ALL the way through, the ending will blow you away.The cast is, in a word, flawless. Kevin Spacey has, as far as I am concerned, never been better. He turns in a performance that is so moving and outstanding that he should have got three Oscars. But he is not alone. Byrne is fantastic, Del Toro adds continental flair, and Postlethwaite is disturbingly dark, yet calculated.By all means watch this film, and observe its strong points, from Bryan Singer's masterful direction to the equally pleasing musical score.

387649,A2FKG4H4O9WFIY,6303908306,George Hatch,"[25, 28]","By now everyone knows ""The Usual Suspects"" so I won't comment on the film, just this MGM Special Edition; and it is a prime example of just how well these can be done. As I said in the headline, this is worthy of the Criterion Collection but at a very affordable price.Side One has both the widescreen and P/S formated versions (although who still wants to watch a cropped film with pan&scan; camera movements the director never made is beyond me). The transfer is high-definition with superb picture quality augmented by 5.1 Stereo Surround Sound. This film on this DVD looks better than when it was on the big screen. This side also features two running commentaries: the one by director Singer and screenwriter McQuarrie is the same one on the first ""Suspects"" DVD which was taken from a special limited edition VHS (Letterboxed film, same plus commentary, and a third box of ""collectables"". I think I was the only one who bought this!) The second commentary of by John Ottman, the editor and composer, and this one is a revelation to anyone who is interested in filmmaking, specifically ""putting the film together after the finished shoot"": editing and scoring. After my initial viewing of the film I really didn't think I could sit through it again right away, especially with the incredible dialogue subdued. But after listening to Ottman for five minutes, his enthusiasm became contagious and I was hooked. There is plenty here that ""Suspects"" fans will appreciate.Side Two has all of the extras and there are plenty of them. Two half-hour documentaries, (""Pursuing the 'Suspects'"" and ""Doing Time with the 'Suspects'"") with the actors, Singer and Ottman. (I guess McQuarrie felt he did his part with the original commentary.) A twenty-minute documentary on ""Keyser Sose: Lie or Legend"" which is funny and informative.  Five deleted scenes introduced by Ottman (but it is easy to see why they were deleted) totalling ten minutes. Add ten minutes of trailers, TV spots, a seven minute gag reel introduced by Singer and some special ""Easter Eggs"" which I plan look for today (and probably watch the film again!) and you'll know everything you've wanted to know about ""Suspects"" and Mr. Sose.There is finally some deserved praise for cinematographer, Tom Sigel, who made this ""$4 million dollar production look like a $50 million film."" Ottman, Singer and Gabriel Byrne also lament how this film, basically a rogue, independent production, could not be made today with studios rejecting originality and artists' visions in lieu of boilerplate plotlines, sequel-itis, and adapting films to their perception of what an audience wants after multiple pre-screenings. Byrne justly calls these ""MacMovies"" and I can't think of a more apt term.Congratulations MGM for elevating your standards on Special Editions.

This film is a brilliant masterstroke--for director Bryan Singer, for writer Christopher McQuarrie, for all the cast of exceptional actors, and most notably, for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, for finally getting it right.Kevin Spacey steals your mind, logic, and ability to think of anything else than you just sitting back and following his tale of just WHO this Keyser Soze really is.Some say the final scene kills the film; others say it perfectly caps off a brilliant plot-twister.

The tight dialogue is great--filled with one-liners you'll be saying for weeks.  The cinematography is amazing, as is the moving score which evokes the old noir classics of the 1940s and 1950s.  Gabriel Byrne is in top, intense form, as is the unlikely pair of Kevin Pollack and Stephan Baldwin.  At the time, Benicio Del Toro was himself a newcomer, but you wouldn't guess it from his performance.

The first time that I saw its surprise ending, I felt as if I had been kicked very hard in my stomach. It was  amazing, and I ended up seeing the movie in the theater seven times.When  the movie came out on VHS in 1996, I bought it immediately. When I bought a  DVD player in the beginning of 1999, it was the first DVD that I bought. I  have seen the movie a total of about 40 times.Christopher McQuarrie's  Oscar winning script is brilliant. Every line counts. There are so many  details packed into the movie that it requires multiple viewings, perhaps  even as many as a dozen, to be fully appreciated. And even after that it  still gets better with each viewing. Bryan Singer's directing is based on a  love of movie making and a very strong, deep respect for the intelligence  of the audience. All of the acting perforances, from the major players like  Oscar winner Kevin Spacey, down to minor roles such as Suzy Amis's, are all  done to perfection. Newton Thomas Segal's camera direction helps to give a  classy, 1940s feel to the movie which makes it all that much more  interesting.

The burning wreckage of a boat and the charred remains of bodies are being dragged out of the harbour by the authorities. It seems like the classic heist gone wrong scenario: five criminals trigger bloody mayhem in attempting to hijack the exchange of [money amount] worth of cocaine between Argentine and Hungarian gangsters. Only two men escape with their lives, one of the Hungarian gangsters, Arkosh Kovash, and Roger ""Verbal"" Kint (Kevin Spacey in superb form), one of the five hijackers, and a cripple to boot.In Bryan Singer's masterful directorial debut we learn how, six weeks earlier, the five men (Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollak, Stephen Baldwin, Benicio del Torro and Spacey) came together in the film's most famous scene - the police identity parade. The Usual Suspects line up for what turns out to be a trumped up police charge which none of them will admit to being implicated in. Locked up in the same cell for the night, they proceed to hatch a plot to rob New York's finest taxi service, a ring of corrupt cops who take bribes from criminals in return for immunity. Only Dean Keaton (the ever impressive Byrne) wants nothing to do with this plan. An ex cop turned criminal, with a reputation for absolute ruthlessness, Keaton is under investigation by FBI agent Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) despite his attempts to go straight. Keaton and Verbal are already acquainted after meeting in prison some years earlier, but Verbal is unknown to the others, and they will only include him in the job if Keaton is on board as well.Through Kujan's interrogation of Kint we learn of the unfolding events and how he persuaded Keaton to become involved. The one flaw that each man shares is that he is addicted to committing crime, and predictably after the taxi service heist the men take on another job hijacking a consignment of diamonds. Unfortunately for them, they get involved with the wrong people and soon find themselves forced into taking on what seems like another, suicidal, job.It becomes clear that there is more to the story than Verbal is letting on, but every time Kujan seems to be getting close to the truth, Kint goes off at a tangent. In parallel to this thread is the interrogation of the horrifically maimed Kovash, who is clearly dying, but before lapsing into unconsciousness in hospital manages to utter the name of the man who seems to be responsible for the carnage in San Pedro, ""Keyser Soze"".The name inspires utter terror in Kovash and when Kujan mentions it to Kint, the same terror seems to take hold of him. Reluctantly, Verbal explains the myth of Keyser Soze - a mysterious underworld figure who every criminal has heard about, but whom nobody knows. Legend has it that back in the days when Soze was a relatively minor criminal in Hungary he butchered his own family rather than surrender to the local mob, proceeded to hunt down and kill his persecutors and their families, and then vanished, becoming a kind of bogey man for other criminals who, if they crossed him, inevitably came to a gruesome end.A razor sharp script by Christopher McQuarrie (which won an Oscar for best screenplay), brilliantly taut and suspenseful direction and a fine ensemble cast make The Usual Suspects an electrifying experience. It possesses all the components to make it one of the best thrillers in recent memory, and will literally have you on the edge of your seat. The fiendishly confusing plot will leave you struggling in its wake and the ending is a stroke of sheer, twisted brilliance.

The audience agrees to submit to his small world and let him drive for a couple of hours, and he in turn agrees not to abuse their trust in suspending their disbelief.  The Usual Suspects gleefully violates that agreement, and that is ultimately the weakest aspect of this film.  You may have heard this already, but the ending really does negate the entire film thanks to the storytelling device chosen.Otherwise, it's a very well-crafted, well-acted, entertaining film.  Spacey in particular is continually being given kudos, but his performance has become somewhat overrated...Gabriel Byrne and Stephen Baldwin are easily as good if not better.If you mind watching a whole film only to have a plot &quot;twist&quot; at the end that basically says &quot;oops...just kidding about all that&quot; (and lord knows I wouldn't blame you), you won't like this film.  If you're willing to overlook that fact, and just enjoy the journey for its own sake (even knowing that the destination makes the trip moot), then you'll enjoy it.Oh, and pretending that you need &quot;higher intelligence&quot; to &quot;get&quot; this film is laughable.  How could anyone not get it...it bludgeons the audience with a plot sledgehammer.  And conversely, it doesn't take a genius to see the gaping black hole in the story by the movie's end either.Technically, the DVD is a bit disappointing.  The image quality is not the greatest, the sound is poor (Dolby 2.0 only, not 5.1), and the only subtitles are spanish.  Ironically, the trailer included in the &quot;extras&quot; is in Dolby 5.1 though.

It feels sort of like MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS. You'll spend the whole movie wondering who's messing with whom, who the mysterious Keyser S&ouml;ze is, and what he's after.A group of mismatched criminals, played to perfection by the cast, are lumped together for a crime apparently none of them were guilty of. Irritated at having their time wasted, they decide to even the score by releaving a few less than honest cops of their less than honest merchandise.

We are entering the profiling era and it was tempting for criminals to return the favor, though they have always done that. They here profile the police and their investigative methods. If you satisfy the police's way of thinking you will go through their net with no difficulty. You just have to convince the cop that a certain criminal does not exist, that this criminal projects you in some kind of legend or saga, is a boogeyman under the  bed or in the closet. If the cops are convinced that this boogeyman is a pure collective invention, some folklore in another word, they will just shrug their shoulders and consider the one who is telling the story is, like all the others, haunted or possessed by a phantasm. And it works. He is the only survivor, or nearly, and he convinces them that his criminal persona is a myth. They are dubious, dubitative, skeptical and many other things, but they cannot imagine you are that myth, that criminal and that you are fooling them massively. To play on the impossibility for these cops to believe such a story can exist is your best diversion, disguise. They are ready to buy a lot but not that someone who is a coward, a weak person, a subservient non-entity, what's more a cripple, can be that ruthless, pitiless and unwavering mastermind of crime. Of course the punch line of the film is that the cop realizes he has been fooled because this cripple being the mastermind is the only explanation why he knows all he knows: he knows too much to just be an accidental witness. And the punch line is doubled with the composite picture of this fantasized criminal as seen by the other survivor who should not have survived and the criminal does not know he is still alive who has seen him very distinctly. This composite picture, a very sketchy image, is arriving on the fax machine as the cripple straightens up and gets into the car that was waiting for him outside the police station. Too late. This tactic has been used by other thrillers, but in this case it is very persuasive and the film works very well provided we do not profile the thriller-maker, otherwise we would know the end before the film ever starts.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",5,When virtual reality becomes ficrional,1215820800,"07 12, 2008",2008,2369,"['not', 'recent', 'film', 'indeed', 'Twin', 'Towers', 'are', 'still', 'standing', 'are', 'entering', 'profiling', 'era', 'was', 'tempting', 'criminals', 'return', 'favor', 'have', 'always', 'done', 'here', 'profile', 'police', 'investigative', 'methods', 'satisfy', 'police', 'way', 'thinking', 'will', 'go', 'net', 'difficulty', 'just', 'have', 'convince', 'cop', 'certain', 'criminal', 'not', 'exist', 'criminal', 'projects', 'kind', 'legend', 'saga', 'boogeyman', 'bed', 'closet', 'cops', 'are', 'convinced', 'boogeyman', 'pure', 'collective', 'invention', 'folklore', 'word', 'will', 'just', 'shrug', 'shoulders', 'consider', 'one', 'who', 'telling', 'story', 'others', 'haunted', 'possessed', 'phantasm', 'only', 'survivor', 'nearly', 'criminal', 'persona', 'myth', 'are', 'dubious', 'dubitative', 'skeptical', 'many', 'other', 'things', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'are', 'myth', 'criminal', 'are', 'fooling', 'massively', 'play', 'impossibility', 'cops', 'believe', 'story', 'can', 'exist', 'best', 'diversion', 'disguise', 'are', 'ready', 'buy', 'lot', 'not', 'someone', 'who', 'coward', 'weak', 'person', 'subservient', 'non-entity', 'what', 'more', 'cripple', 'can', 'be', 'ruthless', 'pitiless', 'unwavering', 'mastermind', 'crime', 'course', 'punch', 'line', 'film', 'cop', 'been', 'fooled', 'cripple', 'being', 'mastermind', 'only', 'explanation', 'why', 'all', 'too', 'much', 'just', 'be', 'accidental', 'witness', 'punch', 'line', 'doubled', 'composite', 'picture', 'fantasized', 'criminal', 'seen', 'other', 'survivor', 'who', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'survived', 'criminal', 'not', 'know', 'still', 'alive', 'who', 'seen', 'very', 'distinctly', 'composite', 'picture', 'very', 'sketchy', 'image', 'arriving', 'fax', 'machine', 'cripple', 'up', 'car', 'was', 'waiting', 'police', 'station', 'Too', 'late', 'tactic', 'been', 'used', 'other', 'thrillers', 'case', 'very', 'persuasive', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'provided', 'do', 'not', 'profile', 'thriller-maker', 'would', 'know', 'end', 'film', 'ever', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Versailles', 'Saint', 'Quentin', 'Yvelines']","The Usual Suspects, Letterbox Edition VHS"

'The Usual Suspects' is a film like no other, a fabulous story, fantastic characters, a sympathetic protagonist and a twist that cannot be rivaled in modern cinema.The story follows a group of five guys, all of who are convicted crims who are trying to keep their heads above water and avoid prosecution. However when they are all questioned in relation to the same crime this unlikely group of characters forge a plan to hit 'New York's finest taxi service' a group of corrupt cops who get kickbacks for taxing convicted criminals around the city. Through this job the group retreat to L.A where they continue to do criminal work, this escalates to a point where the five are sent down to the docks to stop a drug deal going down. It is here though that the narrative takes a turn that if mentioned will ruin the film.The performances in the film are brilliant, as always Spacey's performance is amazing his pure air on camera makes the audience sit up and watch. In playing somewhat of a comic relief role Benicio Del Toro is fabulous and often hilarious. The work of Gabriel Byrne can never be underrated and in 'The Usual Suspects' he shines. Pete Poslethweight is the veteran on screen and plays Kobiashi, the personal lawyer to Kaiser Sozie and represents the antagonist in the piece who takes the five out of their hedonistic dream world and introduces them to the real world.The direction in the film is masterful as the viewer truly gets a feeling of the nitty, gritty world of crime and is one of the few films where the twist isn't given away prematurely. Bryan Singer has truly created a masterpiece of modern cinema that has not been surpassed on the micro/macro level since. The film is faultless; there is nothing that can really be improved.

I've purchased or rented several DVDs in the past year, and I can count on one hand the number of times I actually bothered to check out the extra material.  Only Disney's ""Snow White"" had anything that was truly interesting.THIS ""Special Edition"" had extras that were unique (the profanity-laced Gag Reel), and truly interesting (the featurettes that included interviews with actors, producers, screenwriters, etc.)  My wife and I especially enjoyed the interviews, because they explained how the actors came together to create the chemistry that was needed to drive the plot and keep viewers guessing until the very end.To summarize, 5 con artists are thrown together in a police line-up, and after getting out, they decide to teach the NYPD a lesson for giving them a hard time.  Their act of revenge (more like a thumbing of the nose, or a flipping of the bird) eventually leads them to more criminal acts.  As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that the mysterious Keyser Soze is pulling the strings and making the quintet dance to his own tune.  Just who is Keyser Soze?  That's the question that keeps viewers glued to the screen, as the plot goes through several twists while leading up to an awesome surprise ending!Of course, I am truly biased, because this is my FAVORITE movie of all time.  I would have a difficult time understanding how anyone could not appreciate the good acting, fine screenplay, and surprise ending.  Kevin Spacey became a household name with his portrayal of ""Verbal"" Kint, and Gabriel Byrne and Chazz Palminteri were perfect for their roles (a con man trying to go straight and a customs agent, respectively).  Benicio Del Toro's small part as ""Fenster"" was hilarious - a portrayal he dubs as his ""Mumbles"" (as in the bad guy played by Dustin Hoffman in the ""Dick Tracy"" movie).If you buy ONE DVD for great acting and a cool story (as opposed to ""Whoa!

The film is called "" The Usual Suspects"" and what could be more appropriate than an unusual movie about five suspects who are anything but usual. The story originates with the only survivor of what the police conclude was a murderous and explosive drug deal gone bad. His name is Roger Kint (Kevin Spacey is perfect) also known as 'Verbal.' From the mouth of this innocent storytelling, con-artist comes the fantastic tale of how he and his fellow criminals, Stephen Baldwin, is Michael McManus, Benicio Del Toro is Fred Fenster and Kevin Pollak as Todd Hockney were originally assembled and then set-up. Beginning with a mix-up by law enforcement to put several guilty men together in the same line up, the tale proceeds cross country and culminates with a powerful, but mysterious kingpin by the name of Keyser Soze. It's through his attorney, Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite), the men learn they are marked for death unless they undertake a dangerous assignment. The center piece of the Unusual group is their leader, a remarkable individual named Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne, incredible performance). What transpires in this movie from moment to moment is a lesson in sleigh of hand. What we and the police Dave Kujan, (Chazz Palminteri) are told is not what we see. Conversely, what we see is not what we have been told. In the end, this film with it's haunting theme by John Ottman, is nothing short of incredible.

Examples of this welcome trend include &quot;Unforgiven,&quot; &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, and &quot;The  Lost Boys&quot;, to name an eclectic few.&quot;The Usual  Suspects&quot; does for crime thrillers what &quot;Alien&quot; did for  science fiction--it causes fans to reevaluate what drew thm to the genre in  the first place and rekindles their enthusiasm for it.Usually, movies  of this sort tend to have largely-unknown casts.  &quot;The Usual  Suspects&quot; is all the more remarkable for having an all-star cast, akin  to &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot;.  Chazz Palmintieri plays the hard-nosed  customs official determined to get to the bottom of a drug deal gone bad;  Gabriel Byrne plays a criminal struggling to hove to the  straight-and-narrow, Kevin Spacey shines as the handicapped reluctant  informant Verbal Kint, while Kevin Pollack and the remainder of the cast  represent a cross-section of modern thuggery.This sordid bunch is  brought together in a lineup for a crime none will own up to, during which  they decide to team up for a daring raid on a drug lord's haul.

Kevin Spacey gives one of the best of his always cool, always creepy  performances; personally, I think he should have been nominated for best  actor since everybody else seems to be supporting his contribution to the  film.  If this movie has one flaw, it's that the main bulk of the story is  too complicated to understand upon a first viewing--you probably won't  understand much of what goes on until the second or third time you see it,  after you already know the movie's big secret.  And about the movie's  surprise ending, the people who claim that The Usual Suspects dies once you  know its tricks are completely incorrect.  Think about Psycho or Citizen  Kane or The Empire Strikes Back, movies that all end with mind-warping  twists like this one; they're actually more entertaining when you watch  them again because you get to see how the filmmakers build up to the big  conclusion, and because you get to trace all the little clues that make the  final revelation seem painfully obvious now that you already know what it  is.

387720,A34D06JL7LC6MU,6303908306,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[2, 2]","""The Usual Suspects"" belongs in a league with films like ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Out of Sight."" Not just because all three films juggle with time, but because they're all smartly written, well acted crime capers that are usually overlooked as being ""great films"" (with the exception of ""Pulp Fiction""). ""The Usual Suspects"" blends everything that makes a good crime film. It's well written, has some twists, is well acted, funny, and is rough around the edges. The Usual Suspects are McNamus (Stephen Baldwin), Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), Hockney (Kevin Pollak), Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), and Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey); The five men are brought together when they're called in for a lineup, after a truck is hijacked. Pretty soon, the men are plotting jobs together. This all takes place in a flashback, because the film begins with the death of Keaton. Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri), a cop, wants to get to the bottom of what happened and wants to know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that Keaton is dead. To find out this information, he interviews Verbal Kint, a gimp, who has nothing to lose in revealing information sense he has just been granted immunity by the D.A.'s office. This all leads to the brilliant climax that reveals what exactly a dying Hungarian man meant by the name ""Keyser Soze."" Spacey won his first Oscar for his role as Verbal Kint and he deserved it. For a man who never fails to turn in a winning performance, this is one of his best. The film also won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. The film is directed by Bryan Singer, better known as the director of the first two ""X-Men"" movies and ""Superman Returns."" He's a director that doesn't get a lot of respect from critics or audiences (usually because he's dealing with beloved comic book characters), but with this film he proves that he is a talented director. The movie's fast-paced and very entertaining and when I said it was funny, I don't mean ""ha-ha"" funny...I mean very funny. The lineup scene is one of the funniest scenes I've ever seen. All the performances are good; Baldwin and Del Toro steal the show with their performances though.

There's 6 deleted scenes, with commentary before each.  Overall great value and a treasured addition to the gangster section of my collection.  I wasn't disappointed with this DVD (special edition version), and you won't be either.

Bryan Singer is just such a director, in recent years he's become well known among comic book fans as one of the best directors to bring their favorite heroes to life in a long time, this is because of his films ""X-Men"", ""X2:  X-Men United"" and the recent release ""Superman Returns"".  Before Singer became known as the man that rejuvenated the comic book movie genre, he directed an incredibly taut, thriller with so many twists and turns that it still leaves audiences guessing to this day.  Of course, the movie I'm talking about is ""The Usual Suspects"" starring Kevin Spacey, Gabriel Byrne, and Stephen Baldwin.""The Usual Suspects"" is about a band of small-time criminals who are gathered together one night for a police line-up and while in holding conspire together to pull off a one-time job that requires 5 men to make it a success.  Led by Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), and brilliantly planned by Verbal Kent (Kevin Spacey) this band of criminals pulls off the job without a hitch, and brings down a ring of corrupt cops in the process.  After the job is finished, Keaton tries to walk away from his life of crime, but the allure of even bigger jobs brings him back in.  Just when things were looking good for this band of criminals a man representing the crime lord Keyser Soze, a crime lord whom many believe to be nothing more than a myth amongst criminals, contacts them.  Keyser wants these criminals to pull off a job for him as payback for crimes they committed in their past, crimes that just so happened to interfere with plans Soze had in place for his own gains.  Now, this band of criminals must decide whether to pay off their debt to Keyser Soze, or refuse him and live out the rest of their lives on the run from death at Keyser Soze's hands.Boasting an incredibly talented cast of actors, a twisted storyline that will leave you scratching your head as you struggle to understand everything you've just seen, and an excellent first-time director who shocked Hollywood with this impressive thrill ride.  ""The Usual Suspects"" is most definitely one of those rare Hollywood gems that when it comes along you can't help but pay attention.  Many people have said that this is one movie that once you've seen it, you really can't watch it again to just enjoy it because all of the surprise is gone.  I happen to disagree with these people, the fun in watching this movie during repeat viewings is not the shocking ending, it's trying to piece everything together and catching all of the clues that you miss the first time around.Though the movie sometimes moves slow, though not very often, and these times serve as a nice breather from the mental games being played out in the film, I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for an enjoyable movie that is way more than simple eye candy, but will provoke you to think about what you're watching.""The Usual Suspects"" is rated R for violence and language.",5,Gather Together The Usual Suspects...,1152057600,"07 5, 2006",2006,3094,"['First', 'time', 'directors', 'rarely', 'do', 'great', 'first', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'director', 'rules', 'incredible', 'first', 'film', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'just', 'such', 'director', 'recent', 'years', 'become', 'well', 'known', 'comic', 'book', 'fans', 'one', 'best', 'directors', 'bring', 'favorite', 'heroes', 'life', 'long', 'time', 'films', 'X-Men', 'X2', 'X-Men', 'United', 'recent', 'release', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'Singer', 'became', 'known', 'man', 'rejuvenated', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'genre', 'directed', 'incredibly', 'taut', 'thriller', 'so', 'many', 'twists', 'still', 'audiences', 'guessing', 'day', 'course', 'movie', ""'m"", 'talking', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'starring', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'Stephen', 'Baldwin', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'band', 'small-time', 'criminals', 'who', 'are', 'gathered', 'together', 'one', 'night', 'police', 'line-up', 'holding', 'conspire', 'together', 'pull', 'off', 'one-time', 'job', '5', 'men', 'make', 'success', 'Led', 'Dean', 'Keaton', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'brilliantly', 'planned', 'Verbal', 'Kent', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'band', 'criminals', 'pulls', 'job', 'hitch', 'down', 'ring', 'corrupt', 'cops', 'process', 'job', 'finished', 'Keaton', 'walk', 'away', 'life', 'crime', 'allure', 'even', 'bigger', 'jobs', 'back', 'Just', 'when', 'things', 'were', 'looking', 'good', 'band', 'criminals', 'man', 'representing', 'crime', 'lord', 'Keyser', 'Soze', 'crime', 'lord', 'whom', 'many', 'believe', 'be', 'nothing', 'more', 'myth', 'amongst', 'criminals', 'Keyser', 'criminals', 'pull', 'off', 'job', 'payback', 'crimes', 'committed', 'past', 'just', 'so', 'happened', 'interfere', 'plans', 'Soze', 'had', 'place', 'own', 'gains', 'Now', 'band', 'criminals', 'must', 'decide', 'pay', 'off', 'debt', 'Keyser', 'Soze', 'refuse', 'live', 'out', 'rest', 'lives', 'run', 'death', 'Keyser', 'Soze', 'hands.Boasting', 'incredibly', 'talented', 'cast', 'actors', 'twisted', 'storyline', 'will', 'leave', 'scratching', 'head', 'struggle', 'understand', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'just', 'seen', 'excellent', 'first-time', 'director', 'who', 'shocked', 'Hollywood', 'impressive', 'thrill', 'ride', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'most', 'definitely', 'one', 'rare', 'Hollywood', 'gems', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'pay', 'attention', 'Many', 'people', 'have', 'said', 'one', 'movie', 'once', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'watch', 'again', 'just', 'enjoy', 'surprise', 'gone', 'happen', 'disagree', 'people', 'fun', 'watching', 'movie', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'not', 'shocking', 'ending', 'trying', 'piece', 'everything', 'together', 'catching', 'clues', 'miss', 'first', 'time', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'slow', 'not', 'very', 'often', 'times', 'serve', 'nice', 'breather', 'mental', 'games', 'being', 'played', 'out', 'film', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'looking', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'way', 'more', 'simple', 'eye', 'candy', 'will', 'provoke', 'think', 'what', ""'re"", 'watching', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'rated', 'R', 'violence', 'language']","The Usual Suspects, Letterbox Edition VHS"

It is often classified as a modern film noir, but though it isn't the equal of great modern film noirs as CHINATOWN and L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, on its own terms it is a well-made, entertainingly twisty little mystery. It has good performances all around (Kevin Spacey won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for basically bringing a welcome wit and energy to a generic narrator role---well, at least it seems generic for most of the movie), and Christopher McQuarrie's Oscar-winning screenplay offers deliciously hardboiled dialogue and, especially, some genuinely startling plot twists---with the final twist being the most shocking of all. Personally, I was able to accept that controversial final twist a bit more easily than many others did---it certainly made for great theater, if you know what I mean. Now, whether it truly stands up upon repeated viewings is a more difficult question.

And the more violent, or direct, or less socially constrained people use this language. Get over it. It gives the movie an element of realism.&quot;Didn't feel for the characters&quot; - I can understand this one. These characters are rough, mean and relatively unforgiving. There is very little mercy in this entire movie, and it's a little disturbing for people used to Mel Gibson-type characters. Live with it. There are parts of the world all around us that exist in exactly this kind of mode. If that scares you, too bad. Realistic, or even kinda not-so-realistic looks at that are important.

Something or someone is afoot who does not want them to succeed, and who seems to know their every move.The story is told in flashback by ""Verbal"" Kint, a club footed, crestfallen, soft spoken, unlikely looking criminal. He recounts the details of the doomed heist to hardnosed Detective, David Kujan (Chazz Palmentieri), building his story around an almost mythic, Hungarian crime lord named Keyser Soze. As ""Verbal"" details what happened, the viewer is mesmerized by his compelling narrative of how he and his partners in crime were inveigled into attempting this daring heist, which ultimately led to the disastrous events that culminated on the ship. It seems that their heist was probably destined to be doomed from the start, as another agenda may have been paramount to theirs.Kevin Spacey won a 1995 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his low key, ingratiating portrayal of ""Verbal"" Kint. Gabriel Byrne also gives a compelling performance as the cop who ended on the wrong side of the law. The rest of the cast also give stellar performances, with the exception of Benicio Del Toro, who gives an odd, marble mouthed performance. Notwithstanding this, the film is really a splendid tour de force that is sure to captivate the viewer. Who is the mythic Keyser Soze?

I adore film noir movies, and one of the first things you learn about this genre is NOT TO READ PLOT DETAILS! I will not give away ANY plot details in this review. If you get even the inkling of what happens in the plot, it tends to make you ""wait"" through the entire movie for that particular twist or turn to happen. It is so much better to watch the movie all the way through the first time, plot unknown, to watch how it unfolds. That's what makes the film noir movies so great for watching and rewatching. The first time you see it, you are caught up in how the mystery elements are linked together and unraveled. In subsequent watchings, you know what the end game is, and you now enjoy all the clues and hints that are laid out for you along the way. Where most movies can get boring after a viewing or two, I've seen many of my film noir movies quite a large number of times.The beauty of The Usual Suspects is the stellar cast involved - Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne, Benicio Del Toro, Kevin Pollak, Kevin Spacey, and many others. Every one of these actors does a fantastic job. There are so many quotes, so many specific lines of dialogue, so many tiny eye movements and looks that just bring incredible depth to this story. Again, I don't want to give away the details of the plot for you to ""watch for"". Once you've seen the movie, there will undoubtedly be moments that stand out for you. But don't stop there. Go back and watch it again. Suddenly you'll realize the meaning in the way someone looks at someone else - the way someone reacts to a specific line of dialogue. It's simply brilliant.There are a number of heavily accented characters here which means the first time through you might not really realize what someone is saying. They do that on purpose. Those people *have* accented voices. It means you don't really understand what's going on in some scenes. Again, when you re-watch, you start to sink deeper into the environment. You realize what certain words mean. You realize the context of the situation. It is a multi-layered adventure and each time you take a look, something else unfolds for you.Definitely recommended for owning. This isn't a one-time-watch film. It's something you see multiple times, share with family and friends, and then discuss afterwards.

I hadn't seen it again since it came out 10 years ago, but it was just as good the second time around. It's a dark mystery and thriller about what really amounts to the ultimate bogeyman--a criminal mastermind known as Kaiser Sose--a mysterious but quintessentially evil and nefarious criminal no one has ever seen but who seems to know everyone and everything that goes on in the criminal underworld. No matter how clever you are, he can outsmart you; no matter where you try to run or hide, he can find you (he seems to have spies everywhere), and no matter how bad or tough you are, he's badder and tougher. In short, he's like the seemingly invincible criminal masterminds one used to encounter in the old comic book stories, but reinvented in a more adult way in this very well done movie.If you like convoluted and twisted plots, this movie won't disappoint you either, and just that part of the movie practically takes Kaiser Sose's brainpower to follow and unravel, at least for me. :-) The script is terrific, and the acting by the entire cast is also superb. The drama and suspense build up from the opening scene to the final climax, where at least one of the mysteries is resolved--you finally learn who Kaiser Sose really is. Although Sose's omnipotent presence is felt during the entire movie, he's never actually identified until the last scene, although he does appear on screen. I would have never guessed who it finally turned out to be, but see if you can figure it out yourself. :-) Overall, still a fine movie that has held up very well and that I suspect is destined to become a classic of the film noir and detective/crime genre.",5,A modern classic of film noir,1103155200,"12 16, 2004",2004,1726,"['happened', 'catch', 'film', 'just', 'chance', 'movie', 'channel', 'recently', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'again', 'came', 'out', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'second', 'time', 'dark', 'mystery', 'thriller', 'what', 'really', 'ultimate', 'bogeyman', 'criminal', 'mastermind', 'known', 'Kaiser', 'Sose', 'mysterious', 'quintessentially', 'evil', 'nefarious', 'criminal', 'one', 'ever', 'seen', 'who', 'know', 'everyone', 'everything', 'criminal', 'underworld', 'matter', 'how', 'clever', 'are', 'can', 'outsmart', 'matter', 'where', 'try', 'run', 'hide', 'can', 'find', 'have', 'spies', 'everywhere', 'matter', 'how', 'bad', 'tough', 'are', 'badder', 'tougher', 'short', 'seemingly', 'invincible', 'criminal', 'masterminds', 'one', 'used', 'encounter', 'old', 'comic', 'book', 'stories', 'reinvented', 'more', 'adult', 'way', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'movie.If', 'convoluted', 'twisted', 'plots', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'just', 'part', 'movie', 'practically', 'Kaiser', 'Sose', 'brainpower', 'follow', 'unravel', 'least', 'script', 'terrific', 'acting', 'entire', 'cast', 'also', 'superb', 'drama', 'suspense', 'build', 'up', 'opening', 'scene', 'final', 'climax', 'where', 'least', 'one', 'mysteries', 'resolved', 'finally', 'learn', 'who', 'Kaiser', 'Sose', 'really', 'Sose', 'omnipotent', 'presence', 'felt', 'entire', 'movie', 'never', 'actually', 'identified', 'last', 'scene', 'appear', 'screen', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'guessed', 'who', 'finally', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'see', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'Overall', 'still', 'fine', 'movie', 'held', 'up', 'very', 'well', 'suspect', 'destined', 'become', 'classic', 'film', 'noir', 'detective/crime', 'genre']","The Usual Suspects, Letterbox Edition VHS"

Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollack, Benicio Del Toro, Chazz Palminteri and especially Kevin Spacey. Spacey truly rises above the crowd in this movie. His performance is convincing (which it has to be for the movie to ""work"") and stirring.This is an interesting story made up largely of mind games and betrayal. Each character has his own quirks and his own way of dealing with the situation they find themselves mixed up in. Baldwin and Del Toro's characters (who are partners in crime) are reckless, ""balls-to-the-wall"" criminals who like to go in with guns blazing. Gabriel Byrne's character is an ex-cop, so he is calculated and disciplined. Kevin Pollack's character is a Bad@ss who knows and executes his business well - while Kevin Spacey's character comes off as being intelligent, yet somewhat naive...It is fascinating to watch it all unfold with Verbal Kint's (Kevin Spacey) retelling of the tale in Kujan's office at the precinct. Detective Kujan is played by Chazz Palminteri. The scenes shared by Spacey and Palminteri in that office are among the best moments in the film. These two actors seem to push each other and it really plays well on-screen.Then, of course, the famous ending. Not to spoil it for those who have not yet seen the movie, but this is a twist ending that you probably won't see coming until very late in the movie. It's not your usual, corny cop-out twist ending.

Now I know why all the movie critics and people  still talk about this movie, even to this day. So I finally understand the part with the coffee in Scary Movie and Wrongfully Accused. I find those parts much funnier now. Bryan Singer did a wonderful job on producing and directing this movie. I thougt he did a great job directing X-men, so I was pretty sure &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; would be good. This movie kept me thinking to the very end. I never, ever, ever, would have guessed that 'Kyser Soze' was who he was. This movie is so clever and brillant, it's one of a kind.

The DVD I watched was the original disc (not the fancy new one), and since this movie came out ten years ago the audio and visual quality were pretty bad. But since this is an old-fashioned movie in the sense that it wants to entertain by telling a real story with interesting characters instead of putting all its hopes in flashy special effects, the bad quality of the technology didn't actually matter. The plot is rather confusing, involving the complex lives of five career criminals, strange underground crime deals, and an unseen, mysterious crime boss hovering over all the action. In one sense the film is a traditional whodunit, but as the viewer gets deeper into the story, you not only begin to wonder who did it but what it actually was that he did, since the main story is being told by one of the criminals, and you are never quite sure if he is telling the truth. The screenwriter obviously put a lot of thought into the story, as this is one of the smartest crime films I've ever seen, and it contains surprises for the viewer on a Shyamalanesque scale.

387789,A27RJ30RN5K9MX,6303908306,Mitch Weaver,"[2, 2]","The film centers around five different criminals in New York that are locked up together, based on a trumped up weapons charge. After their release, they decide to work together and get revenge, by commiting crimes. However, someone else is controlling the events that take place. The five men soon discover that they are connected to each other because they have all pulled jobs where they unknowingly ripped off a man going by the alias of Keiser Sose. The mysterious Keiser Sose is basically thought of as the Devil himself in the criminal underworld. The five men are thrust into a world of danger and mystery as they work together to discover the true identity of Keiser Sose.Bryan Singer's ""The Usual Suspects"" is one of the best films ever made in my opinion. If I had to create a list of my five favorite films, it would definately be on that list. When it comes to most mystery films, I can only usually watch them once. Once I know how the film will end, I can never make myself sit through them again because the suprise of what comes next is gone. The thing that impresses me the most about The Usual Suspects, is that the acting and overall storytelling of the film are so well done, that each viewing provides for a rewarding experience despite the fact that I know how it will end. In fact, the film only seems to get better after each time that I see it. The film unfolds brilliantly. It is set up in the format of an interrogation between one of the five men and a U.S. customs agent, giving us flashbacks on the events that led up to that moment in time. The whole film will keep you guessing from one minute to the next, and it culminates in of the greatest endings of all time. Perhaps my favorite aspect of the film, is how director Bryan Singer handles the character of Keiser Sose. The film does a great job at making Sose look like the most imposing and frightening criminal ever, and the fact that his true identity has been kept a secret, only makes the character that much more appealing. You come to believe throughout the course of the movie, that Sose could literally be the Devil himself.Another thing to point out about this film, is that The Usual Suspects probably has one of the best ensemble casts I have ever seen. The five men that the story focuses on are played by five very skilled actors. Gabriel Byrne stars as Dan Keaton who is the leader of the group. Keaton is a character that has two sides to his personality. On one hand, Keaton is chosen as the leader because of how cold, calculating, and evil he is overall. But on the other hand, he gains respect from the men he works with for the code of honor that he lives by which makes him likeable at times. Gabriel Byrne places both sides brilliantly. This film also marks the breakout role for actor Kevin Spacey with his portrayal of a crippled con artist named Verbal Kint. Spacey had to do the most work in the film without a doubt because he not only had to perform scenes in the events that unfold, but Verbal Kint is also the man that is forced to sit through the interigation where we learn about the events that unfold and how they went down. Spacey does a great job on both ends, and is also very convincing as a cripple. He also has great on screen chemistry with Chaz Palmentari who plays customs agent David Kullan that interrogates Verbal. He was outstanding, because of his relentless nature. The rest of the cast includes Benecio Del Toro in one of his best roles ever, Stephen Baldwin, and Kevin Pollack.This highly entertaining and suspenseful mystery, will become an instant favorite of yours. Christopher McQuarrie's amazing script and Singer's trademark style of directing, really make this film a masterpiece. The DVD is worth the money alone just for the extras.

Sometimes you get a film which people say is great because it has a wonderful car chase or there is a nice big explosion or the main character gets to say some wonderful one-liners. This film was being praised because it had a good story.This caught my attention so I went to see it and have watched it many times since. Not because I didn't get it, quite the opposite in fact. I understood the film but I just loved the experience of watching a brilliant story unfold so mcuh that I wanted that experience again and again.Can there be anyone out there who hasn't heard about this excellent film? How can I convince you to rent this, to buy it or just to plain sit down and watct it? Simple - if you like to watch a good film that is far more than car chases, explosions and witty one-liners then this is it.From the intriguing opening scene as we watch a ship go up in flames, the film slowly unfolds a story of how weeks before five men were brought together for a police line-up. Not just any five men, but five criminals who should not have been brought together at all. Plotting revenge against the NYPD for this harrasment is only the beginning and slowly but surely we begin to hear about this underworld myth - Keyser Soze. A powerful underworld lord who may or may not exist. Could it because of him that these five men were brought together? If so, what does he want from them and will they be willing to help him achieve that goal?Watch it and find out, I just hope that the arms of your chair are strong enough because you will be gripping them!The DVD is generally quite good, there is minor digital noise at the start but it is not distracting.

Now, this is a film that doesn't grab you right out of the box, you have to hang in there, and then decide if it was worth it.The movie begins in Calif., where an explosion blows up a ship. It will take you awhile to realize that this is really the beginning of the film. There are so many complications, and characters to sort out. The New York based policeman, Kujan, played by Chazz Palminteri thinks he knows who was involved, and he wants someone to fess up. He has one witness, a criminal named Verbal, played by Kevin Spacey. Kujan and Verbal stay in the office Kujan borrows. where The story is told in flashback. Five suspects who were picked up by the police, played by Gabriel Byrne, a cop gone bad trying to go good; Stephen Baldwin, Benicio Del Toro and Kevin Pollak, in addition to Spacey. None of these characters is going to give up anyone, ever. However,while in the same hail cell they plot a big crime, and this is wherewe find the film.A more convoluted film will be difficult to find. However, the cast of characters kept me in the game. The addition of Giancarlo Esposito, as the FBI agent, he, of 'Breaking Bad' fame, gave the film it's credence. We learn of a really bad guy, Koso, some sort of Polish mafia guy, who shot his own family to show how bad he is. Keeping up is the name of the game, and by the last give minutes the gig is up.

But you wouldn't show this to a younger audience. But for this reason alone I had to give it a 4 star. I think a good crime yarn can have these negative aspects absent. Still like I say it was pretty tame in this department and stood very well on the story alone, and when there was this aspect it fit and wasn't gratuitous.. Frankly this aspect was virtualy a non factor, exept in the intrinsic nature of crime itself.That said I found this a gripping yarn that was intreaguing and interesting the entire show. I can't wait to watch it again, but don't want to watch it too soon as the way it unfolded was just easy enough to follow, but quick enough to keep you one your toes trying to keep up...and wonder if your were following it as good as you needed to. I can't wait to watch it again knowing what is revealed at the end.I suspect upon closer examimnation it's feasability might fall apart.

387848,A361LE16VBQDP8,6303908306,Robert Bezimienny,"[7, 13]","The script is both the hero and the villaim in this film.  Undoubtedly well-written, with abundant (albeit expletive laden) wit, the script establishes characters of great potential interest but fails to develop them.  Gabriel Byrne's character in particular contains elements that beg to be explored - a former corrupt policeman, now reformed thief, in a relationship with a lawyer, trying to live legitimately, with ties to a club-footed conman: one might expect some complex and conflicting motivations to be played out in the plot - surprisingly, the character quickly becomes one-dimensional.  The fact that Kevin Spacey's conman is largely 'narrating' the film only deepens this problem, since he refuses to complicate his own relationship with any of the characters in the tale - he is an inarticulate 'friend' of Byrne, and simply distant and untouched by any of the others.  Frankly, I don't think the central conceit of the film necessitates this failing.  The convolutions of the plot actually boil down to a fairly straightforward premise, and when one finds this out, one can wonder why all the convolutions were necessary, and, for me, this makes it difficult to care about the film as a whole - it means the plot, while coherent, is poorly motivated, and as already mentioned the movie fails as a character study.  Still, the acting is by turns subtle, convincing and humorous, and the 'myth' of Kaiser Szozy (?spelling)  is a suggestive and cleverly dramatised idea.  The film is a highly polished product.  Yet I'm not sure why anyone would want to see this twice, aside from trying to fit a loose piece here or there into the overall puzzle - there are no illuminating insights into human nature, no compelling relationships, and the visuals while competent are hardly memorable.

Under Brian Singer's crisp direction, all of the cast's performances are first-rate.

Were an Academy Award also given for best ensemble, he and others in the cast would have received it.At one point, Kint suggests that &quot;The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.&quot; That comment offers what I consider to be a useful perspective on the film because so much of what happens (or seems to happen) is unconvincing. I began to wonder, which (if any) of the characters can I trust? Was there really a mobster named Keyser Soze? If so, so what? With especially effective use of flashbacks in coordination with Kint's extended interrogation by NYPD detective Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri), Singer seems to be guiding us to one conclusion...only to have another occur, one which left me asking ""Has all this been a dream? Or is it a practical joke? What am I to believe?"" Recalling Kint's comment after I saw The Usual Suspects for the first time, I was almost convinced that Singer's ""greatest trick"" was that his film ""didn't exist.""

And then we find out the significance of the name of the manufacturer of bulletin boards. By the time the last word of the film was spoken, my jaw dropped in amazement. This is an extraordinary film. A film that asks the old question: How can we be sure about the truth of anything? Are things true because we simply believe the teller, who might be a consummate liar? Or do we believe the teller because he tells us what we want to hear?I'm going to stop there because this is not an artsy, philosophical film. This is a suspenseful, action-packed, and strangely-funny movie that has as a PLOT DEVICE our susceptibility to believe what we want to belive--it is not the THEME of the movie. And what a plot device! I can't say any more without giving the story away.So I'll go on to the performances. Yes, Kevin Spacey is great, and all that Academy Award worthiness stuff. But the other actors were overlooked, at least by the critics. Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollak, Chazz Palminteri and Stephen Baldwin all do a great job, but Benicio Del Toro's role as Fenster is nothing less than a tour de force!

387858,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,6303908306,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[3, 3]","A multi-layered story of rapacious greed and ambition, ""Usual Suspects"" puts together a great cast and a story-within-a-story plot.  The Suspects include Keaton (Byrne) a disgraced ex-cop; Roger ""Verbal"" Kint (Spacey), a club-footed petty criminal; Hockney (Pollack) the explosives expert; McManus (Baldwin) who's something of an explosive himself and Fenster (Del Toro).  I'm not sure what Fenster's role is, but given the hushed and marble-mouth tones that he speaks in, nobody else seems to know either.  The story is told in flashback by Verbal after the rest are either dead or presumed dead.  The film begins with the explosive destruction of a freighter in southern California.  Only one other man, the freighter's horrifically burnt passenger, survives.  He knows nothing of our heroes, instead ranting about ""Keyser Soze"".  Recognizing the name of an international criminal who murders almost on whim, and connecting him to the Suspects, a federal agent (Palmintierri) who's made a career of investigating Keaton, puts Verbal on the grill, forcing Spacey's character to recount how the boys came to know each other.  Gathered weeks earlier by the police as suspects or line-up fillers in the hijacking of a police truck carrying guns earmarked for destruction, the suspects (Verbal being one of the ""fillers"") are initially strangers, yet join together and form a plan.  Released when nobody gets pinned for the truck rap, the Suspects go into business - targeting for robbery various high-level smugglers who pay to keep the police at arms length.  Soon their rep brings them to the west coast, but we also learn that they had already come to the attention of Keyser Soze - by virtue of how their crimes have come at his expense.  Blackmailed by Soze through his attorney, Kobayashi (Pete Posthlethwaite, looking and sounding more Indo-Pak than Japanese), the suspects reluctantly follow his orders and shoot their way into a docked freighter loaded (says Kobayashi) with a fortune in cocaine.  By now, Verbal has recounted what he knows of Soze - less a man than a force of nature gone bad; a Hungarian criminal who killed his own family rather than let rivals hold them hostages against him; a mass killer who not only hunts down those who had tried to hold his family hostage, but their friends and families as well.  Soze's is the name that that career criminals utter to themselves when they need something to keep them up at night.Okay, that's as far as I can go without spoiling it.  Sure, you'll probably figure out the big secret within the first few minutes (once a police sketch artist is brought in, the secret will practically leap out at you).  Nevertheless, the script works some great magic.  The ultimate trick isn't Keyser Soze secret identity but how the story gets you to root and care for a crew of wretched, murderous and greedy losers who'd be fodder in a more upstanding story.  The biggest mystery of all, when I saw it, was figuring out what kind of movie this was.  I had an idea that it would be some buddy-buddy picture of good-guy criminals - a sort of ""Brinks Job"" for the 1990's, but the result is much more satisfying.",4,Not your usual movie,1032393600,"09 19, 2002",2002,3161,"['multi-layered', 'story', 'rapacious', 'greed', 'ambition', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'together', 'great', 'cast', 'story-within-a-story', 'plot', 'Suspects', 'include', 'Keaton', 'Byrne', 'disgraced', 'ex-cop', 'Roger', 'Verbal', 'Kint', 'Spacey', 'club-footed', 'petty', 'criminal', 'Hockney', 'Pollack', 'explosives', 'expert', 'McManus', 'Baldwin', 'who', 'something', 'explosive', 'Fenster', 'Del', 'Toro', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'Fenster', 'role', 'given', 'hushed', 'marble-mouth', 'tones', 'nobody', 'else', 'know', 'either', 'story', 'told', 'flashback', 'Verbal', 'rest', 'are', 'dead', 'presumed', 'dead', 'film', 'explosive', 'destruction', 'freighter', 'southern', 'California', 'Only', 'one', 'other', 'man', 'freighter', 'horrifically', 'burnt', 'passenger', 'nothing', 'heroes', 'instead', 'ranting', 'Keyser', 'Soze', 'Recognizing', 'name', 'international', 'criminal', 'who', 'almost', 'whim', 'connecting', 'Suspects', 'federal', 'agent', 'Palmintierri', 'who', 'made', 'career', 'investigating', 'Keaton', 'Verbal', 'grill', 'forcing', 'Spacey', 'character', 'recount', 'how', 'boys', 'came', 'know', 'other', 'Gathered', 'weeks', 'earlier', 'police', 'suspects', 'line-up', 'fillers', 'hijacking', 'police', 'truck', 'carrying', 'guns', 'earmarked', 'destruction', 'suspects', 'Verbal', 'being', 'one', 'fillers', 'are', 'initially', 'strangers', 'yet', 'join', 'together', 'form', 'plan', 'Released', 'when', 'nobody', 'pinned', 'truck', 'rap', 'Suspects', 'go', 'business', 'targeting', 'robbery', 'various', 'high-level', 'smugglers', 'who', 'pay', 'keep', 'police', 'arms', 'length', 'Soon', 'rep', 'west', 'coast', 'also', 'learn', 'had', 'already', 'come', 'attention', 'Keyser', 'Soze', 'virtue', 'how', 'crimes', 'have', 'come', 'expense', 'Blackmailed', 'Soze', 'attorney', 'Kobayashi', 'Pete', 'Posthlethwaite', 'looking', 'sounding', 'more', 'Indo-Pak', 'Japanese', 'suspects', 'reluctantly', 'follow', 'orders', 'shoot', 'way', 'docked', 'freighter', 'loaded', 'Kobayashi', 'fortune', 'cocaine', 'now', 'Verbal', 'recounted', 'what', 'Soze', 'less', 'man', 'force', 'nature', 'gone', 'bad', 'Hungarian', 'criminal', 'who', 'killed', 'own', 'family', 'rather', 'let', 'rivals', 'hold', 'hostages', 'mass', 'killer', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'down', 'who', 'had', 'tried', 'hold', 'family', 'hostage', 'friends', 'families', 'as', 'well', 'Soze', 'name', 'career', 'criminals', 'utter', 'when', 'need', 'something', 'keep', 'up', 'night.Okay', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'go', 'spoiling', 'Sure', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'figure', 'out', 'big', 'secret', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'once', 'police', 'sketch', 'artist', 'brought', 'secret', 'will', 'practically', 'leap', 'out', 'Nevertheless', 'script', 'great', 'magic', 'ultimate', 'trick', ""n't"", 'Keyser', 'Soze', 'secret', 'identity', 'how', 'story', 'root', 'care', 'crew', 'wretched', 'murderous', 'greedy', 'losers', 'who', ""'d"", 'be', 'fodder', 'more', 'upstanding', 'story', 'biggest', 'mystery', 'when', 'saw', 'was', 'figuring', 'out', 'what', 'kind', 'movie', 'was', 'had', 'idea', 'would', 'be', 'buddy-buddy', 'picture', 'good-guy', 'criminals', 'sort', 'Brinks', 'Job', '1990', 'result', 'much', 'more', 'satisfying']","The Usual Suspects, Letterbox Edition VHS"

The Usual Suspects is the original Memento, as time is not a factor and the scenes are like a patchwork quilt, pitching you back and forth between what happened and what is happening.  Confusing, yes, but genius to write it as Christopher McQuarrie did.  He deserved the Oscar he received.  As did Kevin Spacey.The Usual Suspects revolves primarily around Spacey, casting him as Verbal Kint, a gimped man with an odd, pigeon toed like walk.  The walk is brilliantly executed, as it causes the audience to feel sorrow, but at the same time have a deep-seated suspicion that something is going on, primarily because of his monotone voice and his occassional outburst that makes him seem to break from character.  Kint is the only survivor of a harsh firefight and a series of explosions that leave many dead...and one man teetering on the brink of death, repeating the words ""Keyser Soze"" over and over again.  Eventually, the detective heading the investigation (Chazz Palimentri in a flawlessly executed performance) gets the story (or lack thereof) out of Verbal about all the occurred before the fire in the night that left so many charred bodies in its wake.  It is a story involving drugs, deception and a lot of money.By the end, everything comes together, but your brain is tied up in knots, as one question is hovering overhead...""How?""

His only source of information, a crippled man, the only one to make it  out unscathed.

Many films with great surprise endings work within the story to shed new light on what has gone before (Sixth Sense, Memento), but his one completely throws out everything else in the movie, and says, &quot;Nyah, nyah, fooled you, and you sat there and listened to the whole thing!&quot;It's a highly entertaining film, don't get me wrong. It has a great crime story and strong actors letting it all hang out, especially Gabriel Byrne as the one crook who finally figures out what's going on, but don't pretend that the ending is some brilliant twist. If you want to fall into the world of a story, you have to trust that it's a real world, and not one existing solely in the mind of one character.

The ""Usual Suspects"" has the definition of a great script. It keeps you guessing until literally the very last minute when it leaves you in awe. Story twists and state-of-the-art mind games are dominant throughout while parts of the story could actually be separate films alltogether. A big heist involving 5 former convicts, a mysterious underground lord called ""Keyser Sose"", and the story being told in retrospect by ""Verbal"" (Kevin Spacey), a cripple who is interrogated by a top cop (Palminteri) is the basic outline.As you try to make sense out of what ""verbal"" says (while the ""facts"" keep constantly changing and ""verbal"" keeps adjusting his story according to the new clues coming in) the mind game keeps climaxing and the myth about Keyser Sose elevates to incredible manipulations. In fact, the basic theme of the film is ""who is Keyser Sose""? And, exactly because ""Keyser"" could be any of a number of ""suspects"", he could be dead, or he might not even exist the intrigue remains intact till the end.And what an end this is. Possibly one of the most ingenius film-endings ever on celluloid, one not to give away if you are a true fan of the ""Usual suspects"" or a true fan of cinema.But the positives don't stop there. Kevin Spacey doesn't simply give yet another solid performance, he gives a trademark performance, one that many a character have since been based-on on film and doubtlessly more are to follow as the character of ""Verbal"" is sharply inspiring.But then every character in the film has dynamic abilities, every character contributes as a corridor to the endless labyrinth of clues you are trying to collect as you watch. Gabriel Byrne and Del Toro, Stephen Baldwin and Kevin Pollack as well as Palminteri are all in superb form here. The second time I watched this film it became very obvious that all the actors loved being in this stunning flick. No wonder.The director falls not short either, he lets the characters lead and he does his part in setting up the scenery where the elusive Keyser Sose can ""exist"".

So I rented the movie and watched it. Now I just have three words: WTF???I didn't get this movie. Was it supposed to be fun? Exciting? Thrilling? A mystery? What is it? At the end, I just didn't care.Let's start with the characters. They are not very likeable at all to me. None of them are. They just like to cuss and yell all the time. Wow. I am amazed by the acting ability. The characters are just plain not very likeable, so when they all die I can't say I really care.The story was dumb. Or, let me rephrase that. It's not that the story was dumb. The story was very complex. It's just that, who cares? A bunch of guys who we don't like get involved in some deal with some other guy who we don't like, and one survivor who we don't like gets interrogated by a ""tough"" cop who we don't like. Only at the end do we find out that the one ending that we thought we understood but didn't like is replaced by another ending a bit more convoluted but no more likeable. So what's to like?The movie repeatedly makes a big deal about the lack of drugs on the boat. It has to make the point over and over, like it is something really vital for the audience to know. ""Ohmygosh there is no coke!"" or ""Golly gee, it wasn't a drug deal!"". Okay, scriptwriter. We get it already! And now that we know, who cares?So the ""Big Mystery"" was that it was a hit rather than a drug deal. Wow. Really. Amazing. And we are supposed to care for WHAT reason?And Humor? What humor? I've seen several people talk about how hilarious this movie is. When did that happen? I think I was awake the whole movie, and I didn't even take any bathroom breaks. This was supposed to be FUNNY? Where? When? How?And what about the show's tagline? ""Who is Kieser Soze?"" How about this response: ""Who cares?"" I had absolutely no interest whatsoever in who Kieser Soze was the entire movie, and it wasn't until the movie was over that I finally realized that apparently I was supposed to have been concerned about this. I was supposed to have been thinking about who might be Kieser Soze the entire movie. Only I didn't. I guess the writing was just too sophisticated for a dense guy like me.So it is a mystery then? Who is Kieser Soze? Okay, so let it be a mystery. Except, this movie ruins that for an audience too. Instead of letting there be any mystery, they rush at the end to explain the entire movie to you and let you know EXACTLY who the guy is. What mystery? What is there to discuss any further about this movie? And why would anybody ever want to watch it again?This was a waste of time and waste of money. I can't believe this has an Amazon rating of 4-1/2 stars, for crying out loud! What are you people smoking???If anybody wants to see a GOOD crime movie, with characters we can actually feel for and care about plus a complex and intriguing story, try watching THE GODFATHER again. Now THAT is what good moviemaking is all about.So are you pissed off yet? Leave me a ""No, this review was not helpful"" rating if you want to folks, but I just didn't get this movie.

387887,A3D6TFYRMIV3ZL,6303908306,Themis-Athena,"[183, 197]","""Round up the usual suspects.""  And so they do - and ending up in the lineup are career criminals Michael McManus, Fred Fenster and Todd Hockney (Stephen Baldwin, Benicio del Toro and Kevin Pollack), ex-cop gone bad gone good again Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne) and small-time con man Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey).Wait a minute ... five criminals in one lineup?  There's something wrong here, right?  Right ...In ""The Usual Suspects,"" not only every line but every gesture, every facial expression and every camera cut counts.  Even if you distrust the story being told, you can't exactly pin down everything that's wrong with it.  The plot unfolds through the tale extracted from Kint, one of two survivors of a massacre and subsequent explosion on a boat docked in San Pedro Harbor, by U.S. Customs agent David Kujan (Chazz Palminteri).  And at the same time as Kint is spinning his yarn, in a nearby hospital the other survivor (badly injured and fresh out of a coma) helps a police sketch artist draw a picture of the mastermind behind the scheme - ""the devil,"" Keyser S&ouml;ze.You can watch this movie countless times, and you will still discover new subtleties every single time.  Not only will you find that it still makes sense after the story line has been unraveled at the end (which therefore is a plot twist, not a non-sequitur).  You'll also discover nuance upon nuance in Kevin Spacey's incredible performance.  You'll see that tiny apologetic grin on Todd Hockney's face as attorney Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite) lists a weapons truck heist - the very act which brought them together in the initial lineup, and which they have all come to believe to have been a trumped-up charge - as Hockney's latest sin against Keyser S&ouml;ze, now forming part of the debt to be repaid by participating in the suicide mission in San Pedro Harbor.  And at some point you'll also have figured out all of Fenster's lines (not being a native English speaker, I am relieved to find that I wasn't the only one struggling with them at first) ... although the mumbling is of course part of his character, and is as excellently delivered as every other aspect of Benicio del Toro's acting, his lines are so funny and to the point you almost wish he'd speak more clearly so you wouldn't miss half his punch lines the first time around.Among a cast of tremendous actors (to name just two, Gabriel Byrne in one of his best performances and Benicio del Toro, deserving much more than just an ""also starring"" mentioning in the opening credits), Kevin Spacey's star shines brightest.  To this day it is a mystery to me how he came to be awarded the Academy Award for Best *Supporting* Actor - the only things the man supports (in fact carries, almost single-handedly) in this movie are Bryan Singer's directing and Christopher McQuarrie's screenplay, and that alone makes him the movie's lead character.  But regardless of its title, the award was more than justified, and so was the one for McQuarrie's screenplay.  With infinite trust in the audience's ability to pick up on little gestures, looks and inflections of his voice, Kevin Spacey displays all the many aspects of his character at the same time; and even the tenth time around, his performance still holds as true as the first time you watch the movie.  Almost expressionless he tells his tale, always seeming to give away just about as much as he has to, and only raising his voice for a pointed (and exquisitely timed) expletive upon first being confronted with the name Keyser S&ouml;ze, and for a wailing ""Why me??"" as agent Kujan tries to convince him that his own archenemy, Keaton, has been behind their failed enterprise all along and purposely let him (Kint) live to tell their story.This is one of those movies which have you quote their many memorable one-liners forever.  (Just look at how many reviewers on this site alone are quoting the one about ""the devil's greatest trick."")  To the extent that it cites other works, those citations pay homage, they don't merely copy - right down to the name of the movie's production company (Blue Parrot/Bad Hat); like the title containing a reference to ""Casablanca,"" the prototype of all films noir (or those made in Hollywood at least).  It is one of the best modern examples of the genre and has long since become a cult classic - it's a must in every decent collection.Also recommended:Memento (Widescreen Two-Disc Limited Edition)L.A.

At various points throughout its runtime, it is almost disarmingly comic, action-packed and insightful, yet at any given point when the film seems to be conforming to the clich&eacute;s of its genre, the director is merely toying with the viewer and laying the foundations for one of cinema's most memorable climaxes.  ""The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he doesn't exist."" So says Kevin Spacey's Verbal Kint to his interrogator Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri), a US Customs Officer investigating the quayside slaughter of dozens of Argentinian sailors in what looks like the bloody aftermath of a major drugs deal. Mysteriously, Kint has been granted immunity in exchange for evidence, but the story he weaves in Kujan's office just doesn't seem to add up. Just how reliable is Kint's take on events leading up to the massacre, the genesis of which occurred some six weeks earlier when five ex-cons were bizarrely rounded up for an identity parade at a New York police station? Kint, one of the five, and, hampered by physical deformities, definitely the sickliest, appears to be the only survivor. He also appears to be the only witness to the death of the alleged ringleader of the group, Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), a notoriously corrupt ex-cop. But Kujan has a hard time believing that Keaton is really dead. He knows his form, and had not for one moment bought Keaton's recent line that his criminal days were behind him. Besides, Kint's evasive, slithering persona does not inspire confidence that what he's telling approximates to anything like the truth.  Looming over everything; however, is the unseen presence of Keyser Soze, a near-mythical Turkish crime-lord who embodies the elusive cunning of the devil to whom Kint alludes. Soze appears to be pulling all the strings, yet it's by no means clear that he's not simply a figment of the paranoid imagination of a collective criminal mind.Spacey and Byrne, a study in contrasts both physical and temperamental, bring actorly gravitas to Bryan Singer's stylish and eloquent crime film. Spacey (who won Best Supporting Actor for the role) seems to shrink within himself as Kint, carrying his wounded, twisted body with the caution of a dog who's expecting a kicking; yet his ever watchful presence betrays a canny awareness that suggests he's not necessarily the weak link he may at first sight appear. Byrne, physically imposing and craggy-featured, is evidently a far more dangerous proposition than Spacey, yet the existential angst that grips him is characterized by a troubled conscience that makes him easily the most complex of the group.

Its larger-than-life allure results from a seamless blending of elements: Pschodrama, Action, Suspense and Mystery, all built on intricate storytelling, a dynamic screenplay and taught direction, by Bryan Singer. The aforementioned are all bolstered by credible in-depth character development, brought to life by an outstanding cast, who flesh out each role to chilling near perfection. (Kevin Spacey, seen here before most people would have recognized his name, received an Oscar for his &quot;supporting&quot; role!)But let's not get sidetracked. More than anything else,&quot;SUSPECTS&quot; is about the unparalleled unsettling reaction you get from  viewing it! From the first scene to the end credits, it gets a headlock on your psyche, while sending the pit of your stomach into endless free fall! The only way to illustrate this, without giving away any key elements of the film, is a detailed look at the opening scene....a peerless example of instant timeless classic film noir.On a boat, docked in San Pedro Harbor, the dying sole-survivor of an apparently devastating bloodbath shootout painfully ignites a thin trail of gasoline. His obvious intention: Destroy EVERYTHING...himself included! From a deck higher up, an unseen someone pisses out the trail of flames. The shadowy figure walks down the stairs with an unhurried beliberation and saunters over to the agonizing man he has just saved. They exchange somewhat forced greetings and a few disjointed words of banter.Without warning, the intruder firmly raises a pistol, his unblinking gaze reflected in eyes locked in contact with his own. Unhesitatingly, he fires two consecutive shots. A brief pause of contemplation ends when he casually lights a cigarette, stategically dropping his lighter to rekindle the liquid fuse, and then beats a hasty off-board retreat.What better way to introduce a character whose twisted iron resolve is so perverse, so deranged, that he saves a doomed man seconds before certain death, solely for the unmititgated pleasure derived from looking him squarely in the eye, his victim looking right back, while pulling the trigger himself. Without uttering a syllable, his actions shout out,&quot;I piss on you and your puny existence!&quot; His victim's final moments are thusly converted into a living/dying testimony, clearly demonstrating who it is that decides the particulars of when and how he will die!&quot;SUSPECTS&quot; has been severely critiqued by a vocal minority (to paraphrase another Amazon reviewer) for not knowing the difference between a plot twist and a non sequitur. With all due respect to the reviewer, who painstakingly highlighted the difference for us, perhaps a careful second viewing would shed some light on the source of this common confusion. After watching  &quot;SUSPECTS&quot; four times making every effort to employ my most discerning eye, I am convinced the true genius of the movie hinges on this particular point!Let me underscore my unequivocal recommendation of this film with  a special note to those of you who avoid the Action or Suspense genre becuase of your distaste of the excessive violence that generally characterizes them. Well, THIS IS NO JOHN WOO FILM! A lot of the scenes are done in the &quot;Old School&quot; style, where the violence is kept off-screen. Although there is considerable TALK in &quot;SUSPECTS&quot; about some of the most dastardly deeds imaginable, virtually none of this is graphically portrayed. So, PLEASE, if you have not seen it yet, because of this reason, I urge you to make an exception in this case...GET IT AND SEE IT!",5,DEFINITELY NOT......YOUR &quot;USUAL&quot; MOVIE,969926400,"09 26, 2000",2000,3676,"['quot', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'quot', 'certainly', 'pigeon', 'holing', 'labeling', 'larger-than-life', 'allure', 'results', 'seamless', 'blending', 'elements', 'Pschodrama', 'Action', 'Suspense', 'Mystery', 'built', 'intricate', 'storytelling', 'dynamic', 'screenplay', 'taught', 'direction', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'aforementioned', 'are', 'bolstered', 'credible', 'in-depth', 'character', 'development', 'brought', 'life', 'outstanding', 'cast', 'who', 'flesh', 'out', 'role', 'chilling', 'near', 'perfection', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'seen', 'here', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'have', 'recognized', 'name', 'received', 'Oscar', 'quot', 'supporting', 'quot', 'role', 'let', 'not', 'get', 'sidetracked', 'More', 'anything', 'else', 'quot', 'SUSPECTS', 'quot', 'unparalleled', 'unsettling', 'reaction', 'get', 'viewing', 'first', 'scene', 'end', 'credits', 'headlock', 'psyche', 'sending', 'pit', 'stomach', 'endless', 'free', 'fall', 'only', 'way', 'illustrate', 'giving', 'away', 'key', 'elements', 'film', 'detailed', 'look', 'opening', 'scene', 'peerless', 'example', 'instant', 'timeless', 'classic', 'film', 'boat', 'docked', 'San', 'Pedro', 'Harbor', 'dying', 'sole-survivor', 'apparently', 'devastating', 'bloodbath', 'shootout', 'painfully', 'thin', 'trail', 'gasoline', 'obvious', 'intention', 'Destroy', 'EVERYTHING', 'included', 'deck', 'higher', 'up', 'unseen', 'someone', 'out', 'trail', 'flames', 'shadowy', 'figure', 'down', 'stairs', 'unhurried', 'beliberation', 'saunters', 'agonizing', 'man', 'just', 'saved', 'exchange', 'somewhat', 'forced', 'greetings', 'few', 'disjointed', 'words', 'banter.Without', 'warning', 'intruder', 'firmly', 'pistol', 'unblinking', 'gaze', 'reflected', 'eyes', 'locked', 'contact', 'own', 'Unhesitatingly', 'two', 'consecutive', 'shots', 'brief', 'pause', 'contemplation', 'ends', 'when', 'casually', 'cigarette', 'stategically', 'dropping', 'lighter', 'rekindle', 'liquid', 'fuse', 'then', 'beats', 'hasty', 'off-board', 'retreat.What', 'better', 'way', 'introduce', 'character', 'twisted', 'iron', 'resolve', 'so', 'perverse', 'so', 'deranged', 'doomed', 'man', 'certain', 'death', 'solely', 'unmititgated', 'pleasure', 'derived', 'looking', 'squarely', 'eye', 'victim', 'looking', 'right', 'back', 'pulling', 'trigger', 'uttering', 'syllable', 'actions', 'shout', 'out', 'quot', 'piss', 'puny', 'existence', 'quot', 'victim', 'final', 'moments', 'are', 'thusly', 'converted', 'living/dying', 'testimony', 'clearly', 'demonstrating', 'who', 'particulars', 'when', 'how', 'will', 'die', 'quot', 'SUSPECTS', 'quot', 'been', 'severely', 'critiqued', 'vocal', 'minority', 'paraphrase', 'Amazon', 'reviewer', 'not', 'knowing', 'difference', 'plot', 'twist', 'non', 'sequitur', 'due', 'respect', 'reviewer', 'who', 'painstakingly', 'highlighted', 'difference', 'perhaps', 'careful', 'second', 'viewing', 'would', 'shed', 'light', 'source', 'common', 'confusion', 'watching', 'quot', 'SUSPECTS', 'quot', 'four', 'times', 'making', 'effort', 'employ', 'most', 'discerning', 'eye', 'am', 'convinced', 'true', 'genius', 'movie', 'particular', 'point', 'Let', 'underscore', 'unequivocal', 'recommendation', 'film', 'special', 'note', 'who', 'avoid', 'Action', 'Suspense', 'genre', 'becuase', 'distaste', 'excessive', 'violence', 'generally', 'Well', 'THIS', 'NO', 'JOHN', 'WOO', 'FILM', 'lot', 'scenes', 'are', 'done', 'quot', 'Old', 'School', 'quot', 'style', 'where', 'violence', 'kept', 'off-screen', 'considerable', 'TALK', 'quot', 'SUSPECTS', 'quot', 'most', 'dastardly', 'deeds', 'imaginable', 'virtually', 'none', 'graphically', 'portrayed', 'So', 'PLEASE', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'yet', 'reason', 'urge', 'make', 'exception', 'case', 'GET', 'IT', 'AND', 'SEE', 'IT']","The Usual Suspects, Letterbox Edition VHS"

387907,AHTEDRC5XLKK0,6303908306,"WebViking ""WebViking""","[2, 2]","The Usual Suspects is 1995's fantastic mystery/thriller directed by Brian Singer and written by Christopher McQuarrie.  It stars Stephen Baldwin as Michael McManus, Gabriel Byrne as Dean Keaton, Benicio Del Toro as Fred Fenster, Kevin Pollack as Todd Hockney, and Kevin Spacey as Verbal Kint, five ex-cons pulled together for a line up for a NY York truck hijacking investigation.  The film won two Oscars, one for McQuarrie's original screenplay and one for Spacey's brilliant performance as a supporting actor in the role of Verbal Kint.The movie starts at the end with Dean Keaton being shot on a boat in San Pedro, CA, by a mysterious character named Keysor Sose, and from there skips back and forth between the past and present as the police investigate the fire and mayhem that occurred on the boat resulting in the loss of 27 lives.  The only survivors are a badly burned and comatose Hungarian sailor and the crippled Verbal Kint, who has gotten immunity for his testimony in what happened between the line-up and the boat disaster in California six weeks later.Without ruining the plot, let me just say we are introduced to the idea of Keyser Sose as some sort of mystical uber-criminal who had manipulated the gang from the very beginning to end up dead on the boat in California.  The end of the film is one of the most stunning endings in the history of Hollywood, and there are to this day, huge arguments about it.  I'm not going to spoil it here with my conjectures, you'll just have to watch the movie.The cinematography was really nothing to write home about, pretty standard stuff for the most part.  The score was unobtrusive.  The story is what drives this film and makes it special.  And the actors were well chosen to run with the story.  The five guys that play the ex-cons do a fantastic job.  Also I really enjoyed Chazz Palminteri's portrayal of US Customs agent Dave Kujan, and Pete Postlewaite's portrayal of Keyser Sose's lawyer Kobayashi.  The acting in this movie was truly first rate.Although the gang starts out avoiding violence, the film does become very violent.  It's rated R for a reason.  Some people may be uncomfortable with the level of violence in the movie.  But even so, it's one of the best mystery/thrillers I've ever seen.

In particular Gabriel Byrne's cynical and beaten down reformed criminal gone bad role is played so ernestly that you forget you are watching a film. Kevin Spacey's Verbal Gint character is terrific to watch as well. Benicio del Toro steals scenes with his bizzare choice of character in an otherwise nothing role. Even Steven Baldwin turns in a good performance as does Kevin Pollack in a somewhat different role than he usually plays.All the acting is terrific and more importantly, the script is nearly flawless as is the direction. The plot moves along in it's multi-threaded fashion while keeping viewers entertained and involved enough to pay attention.The ending will either annoy or delight you depending on how you view films. I loved it and on second viewing the forshadowing of events are right in front of you like a good murder mystery although The Usual Suspects is much more than a mystery film or buddy flick or crime caper film while being a little bit of each.It's great to see a film that isn't high budget and relies on acting and a good script to move the film along.

(Note: one of my favorite movies of all time).  Specifically, I'd like to praise Bryan Singer and Christoper MacQuarrie for  their director's commentary track.When we got our DVD player last  year, the first DVD I rented was The Usual Suspects.  We watched the movie  all the way through (probably our 10th time seeing this film), and then put  on the movie with the director's commentary soundtrack, thinking we'd see  what it sounded like and watch it later.  Two hours later, we realized that  we had just watched the movie twice in a row.Singer and MacQuarrie  speak in depth about writing this movie, about setting up the shots, about  all the background detail in the movie, about the technical details such as  sound, editing, and film score.  I learned more about filmmaking from  listening to their commentary than I have reading books on the subject.  Since Singer and MacQuarrie are friends and business partners, it was  entertaining to listen to their exchange; it was like getting the inside  scoop from your best friends who happen to be filmmakers.  I was enthralled  the entire time.Since this was the first commentary I'd ever  experienced, I figured it was standard for DVD director's commentaries to  be so thorough, informative, and entertaining.  I was wrong.  I have yet to  find another commentary this interesting, although I've experienced some  awful commentaries (The Matrix) and one that was almost as good (The Prince  of Egypt).

387916,AP3B615GM191G,6303908306,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 2]","Before I offer any analysis of ""The Usual Suspects"", I would first like to say that (as is well know by now) the film has perhaps the most mind-blowing ending in the history of American Cinema.  I have long been a fan of movies with endings that are shockers (The Sixth Sense and The Others stand out as favorites), but this movie took it to an entirely new level.I won't give away the ending here, but I will say that this film follows a narrative pattern such that guessing the ""big reveal"" is difficult, as information is revealed in flashbacks, thus getting more complex as the story continues.  However, many other Amazon reviewers have said that, after repeated viewings (I have only seen the film once), it IS possible to somewhat predict what is going to happen.I didn't know what to expect when I sat down to watch this movie, but I knew I was not a fan of gangster/crime films, so I was a bit leery.  However, the story is so expertly crafted that one (myself included!) completely forgets that the main characters are criminals and instead focuses on the plot twists and turns.So, I would highly recommend this film to two categories of viewers: First, those of you like me who have never seen this classic film until ""now"" and are wondering what all the buzz is about, you won't be disappointed.  Second, those of you who love surprise endings (even if you aren't too keep on cop/police dramas) will obsess over this film for weeks or months after viewing!",5,Looking For Something Different?
