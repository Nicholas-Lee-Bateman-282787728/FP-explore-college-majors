You all probably know Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy by now, anyway. This movie sticks close to the book in most ways, but they did do something strange: Margaret O'Brien, who plays Beth, is smaller and shorter, and presumably younger than Amy as played by Elizabeth Taylor. Also, there are few people who have ever imagined Elizabeth Taylor as a blond!Peter Lawford does a great job as Laurie, and Rossano Brazzi is positively romantic as Professor Bhaer. In fact, it really is a great cast, with everyone looking very much like I would have imagined them as I read the story for the first time, except for what seems like a switch of Beth and Amy's ages. If the two actresses were in fact in the right relative ages for their parts, I would find this no problem at all. But it is distracting. Perhaps we are to understand that Beth, being very frail, has simply not thrived the way Amy has. They are not that far apart in age, and I was taller than my older sister from the time I was about five.This one is in color, which makes it more pleasant to watch than the earlier one with Kate Hepburn. But some of the backgrounds are awfully fake looking, especially the one where Laurie corners Jo out in the country after she ran off from Meg's wedding. I could swear that was a painted backdrop!On the whole, a good movie and a pretty faithful rendition of the book. I would give it four stars if it weren't for the above-discussed casting question",3,Good Version of a Very Familiar Story,1337385600,"05 19, 2012",2012,1506,"['OK', 'probably', 'need', 'go', 'detail', 'story', 'probably', 'know', 'Meg', 'Jo', 'Beth', 'Amy', 'now', 'anyway', 'movie', 'close', 'book', 'most', 'ways', 'did', 'do', 'something', 'strange', 'Margaret', ""O'Brien"", 'who', 'Beth', 'smaller', 'shorter', 'presumably', 'younger', 'Amy', 'played', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'Also', 'are', 'few', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'ever', 'imagined', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'blond', 'Peter', 'Lawford', 'great', 'job', 'Laurie', 'Rossano', 'Brazzi', 'positively', 'romantic', 'Professor', 'Bhaer', 'fact', 'really', 'great', 'cast', 'everyone', 'looking', 'very', 'much', 'would', 'have', 'imagined', 'read', 'story', 'first', 'time', 'what', 'switch', 'Beth', 'Amy', 'ages', 'two', 'actresses', 'were', 'fact', 'right', 'relative', 'ages', 'parts', 'would', 'find', 'problem', 'distracting', 'Perhaps', 'are', 'understand', 'Beth', 'being', 'very', 'frail', 'simply', 'not', 'thrived', 'way', 'Amy', 'are', 'not', 'far', 'apart', 'age', 'was', 'taller', 'older', 'sister', 'time', 'was', 'five.This', 'one', 'color', 'more', 'pleasant', 'watch', 'earlier', 'one', 'Kate', 'Hepburn', 'backgrounds', 'are', 'awfully', 'fake', 'looking', 'especially', 'one', 'where', 'Laurie', 'corners', 'Jo', 'out', 'country', 'ran', 'off', 'Meg', 'wedding', 'could', 'swear', 'was', 'painted', 'backdrop', 'whole', 'good', 'movie', 'pretty', 'faithful', 'rendition', 'book', 'would', 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'were', ""n't"", 'above-discussed', 'casting', 'question']",Little Women VHS

Thankfully we now have it on DVD and can watch it any time we wish.  It is very true to the book authored by a favorite author of mine, Louisa May Alcott.As a woman I like the book and the movie because of the strength of the March women in an era when most women were expected to live a certain role.  I also like how each of the daughters Jo, Beth, Amy and Meg along with the mother who is a widow are all spirited females and not at all wimpy or whiny.  Remembering at all times that the story was/is set in Civil War times.The movie never lags but blends smoothly from one scene to the next.  The cinematography has held up well over the decades and the movie doesn't show its age visually.

This is the one that is true to the spirit of the book.  It is also the best movie.The members of the cast were superb in their roles.  Margaret O'Brien gives a definitive performance as Beth.  Mary Astor is the Marmee of the novel brought to life on the screen.  Sir C. Aubrey Smith gives a moving performance as Mr. Lawrence.  The scene between him and Beth would make a statue cry. (Unfortunately, this was the last film of his distinguished career.  He died six months after the film was completed.)The 1933 version had Katherine Hepburn but not much else.The 1971 BBC version with its three and a half hours included more of the book, but the acting was lamentable, and even the BBC departed from its policy of faithfulness to literary works by substituting feminist advice when Marmee advises Meg on her marital problems.  (Read this passage in Alcott's book.  Its wisdom would save many a modern marriage.)The 1994 version throws the book away, replaces all the characters with contemporary teenager types and turns Marmee into a radical feminist.(Note that a novelization of this 1994 movie was published when the movie was released.  It is simply the filmscript written into novel form, a hundred pages or so and, like the movie, bears little resemblance to Alcott's novel.  Many people read that book, thinking they were reading the 800 page Little Women by Louisa May Alcott.  Possibly, this is the version that the Amazon reviewer read.  Otherwise, it is impossible to explain his rather bizarre review.  There are also abridgments in print.  Caveat emptor.  Such literary crimes ought to be against the law.)But whether you care about the book or not, if you want a good family movie, this is it.",5,the quintessential family movie,1131062400,"11 4, 2005",2005,1847,"['want', 'know', 'what', 'family', 'can', 'mean', 'should', 'mean', 'movie', 'will', 'show', 'None', 'other', 'four', 'movie', 'versions', 'will', 'do', 'one', 'true', 'spirit', 'book', 'also', 'best', 'movie.The', 'members', 'cast', 'were', 'superb', 'roles', 'Margaret', ""O'Brien"", 'definitive', 'performance', 'Beth', 'Mary', 'Astor', 'Marmee', 'novel', 'brought', 'life', 'screen', 'Sir', 'C.', 'Aubrey', 'Smith', 'moving', 'performance', 'Mr.', 'Lawrence', 'scene', 'Beth', 'would', 'make', 'statue', 'cry', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'last', 'film', 'distinguished', 'career', 'died', 'six', 'months', 'film', 'was', 'completed', '1933', 'version', 'had', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'not', 'much', '1971', 'BBC', 'version', 'three', 'half', 'hours', 'included', 'more', 'book', 'acting', 'was', 'lamentable', 'even', 'BBC', 'departed', 'policy', 'faithfulness', 'literary', 'works', 'substituting', 'feminist', 'advice', 'when', 'Marmee', 'Meg', 'marital', 'problems', 'Read', 'passage', 'Alcott', 'book', 'wisdom', 'would', 'save', 'many', 'modern', 'marriage', '1994', 'version', 'book', 'away', 'characters', 'contemporary', 'teenager', 'types', 'Marmee', 'radical', 'feminist', 'Note', 'novelization', '1994', 'movie', 'was', 'published', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'simply', 'filmscript', 'written', 'novel', 'form', 'hundred', 'pages', 'so', 'movie', 'little', 'resemblance', 'Alcott', 'novel', 'Many', 'people', 'read', 'book', 'thinking', 'were', 'reading', '800', 'page', 'Little', 'Women', 'Louisa', 'May', 'Alcott', 'Possibly', 'version', 'Amazon', 'reviewer', 'read', 'Otherwise', 'impossible', 'explain', 'rather', 'bizarre', 'review', 'are', 'also', 'abridgments', 'print', 'Caveat', 'emptor', 'Such', 'literary', 'crimes', 'ought', 'be', 'law', 'care', 'book', 'not', 'want', 'good', 'family', 'movie']",Little Women VHS
281933,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,6301971280,Byron Kolln,"[1, 1]","Aside from the legendary Katharine Hepburn-George Cukor 1933 RKO version, this is probably my personal favourite film adaptation of the Louisa May Alcott story.  Filmed in glowing Technicolor, and using many of the 1933's original set and costume designs, it provides a nice showcase for the always popular pairing of June Allyson and Peter Lawford (those cute co-eds from ""Good News"").Controversy has always dogged MGM's 1949 colour remake, chiefly for it's casting.  Whilst her teenage years were well and truly behind her when she landed the role of Jo, it's hard to imagine the role being played by anybody other than June Allyson.  She was MGM's ""go-to"" girl for such assignments in that period.  Likewise, Elizabeth Taylor's role of Amy - in a none-too-flattering blonde wig - has always been unfairly dismissed as one of the rare missteps in Taylor's film resume, but when you look back at the depiction of Amy in the book and then refer again to Taylor's performance, it sits quite comfortably.  Peter Lawford's casting as Laurie is quite charming.  Laurie is such a cardboard character in this version (less so but still quite stiff in the 1933 movie); Lawford does what he can to enliven the character.The ""veterans"" of the cast add some depth - Mary Astor is a brilliantly-understated Marmee and Lucile Watson is crabby old Aunt March.  Margaret O'Brien once again cries until the cows come home as frail, doomed Beth.  For whatever reason, the ages of Amy and Beth were switched from the book; this version depicts Beth as the youngest, mainly because Ms O'Brien could never visually pass as the older sister of Elizabeth Taylor.  Dramatically it also works quite well, as Beth being the ""baby"" of the family illustrates further her weak health situation.Lovers of the 1933 film will find some scenes (right down to the sets and actors' blocking) are copied almost verbatim in this version!  Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery; I wonder if George Cukor ever picked up on the fact that he also ""directed"" the 1949 remake by osmosis?  There is however one charming scene that the 1949 version possesses which is all it's own, and it's the one where the girls visit the general store to buy Christmas gifts with their $1 from Aunt March.  Presumably it replaces the delightful parlour pantomime ""The Witch's Curse"" from the 1933 version.For all it's shortcomings, the film is beautifully shot, lovingly put together; and despite a hefty 2-hour running time, clips along at a very brisk pace.

This is a standalone film, having its own interest and features.  It carries the addition of color, excellent cinematography and MGM's noted style overall well tailored to the charm of the period and setting.  I don't mind any of the film looking good or how they did it; it's part of the treat of this version.  It's casting and performances have their own flavor as well, personal standouts for me being Peter Lawford the best I've ever seen him, a very nuanced and effective (if over made up) Amy, a stellar Beth, and even a more prominent and pleasing family maid. (She had been with them since Meg was a baby.)  They probably switched the ages of the two younger girls due to the suitability for the roles of the players they had available under contract.Being a lover of warm hearted movies, old fashioned classics and family stories, this one is really a rose. I can see why Laurie envied the family's togetherness when the lamps are lit and he can see inside their cozy parlor.  It's a bright and resourceful family, whose ups and downs engage both interest and heart.  That rates far higher to me than being able to spot various inconsistencies, painted backdrops, et al.  Realistically portrayed in the film, they bickered and complained as well as worked together harmoniously.  It's somehow possible to feel a part of it all as it goes along, an experience one delights in repeating.

As far as I can see, it's a contest as to who delivers the most artificial performance, Allyson or Margaret O'Brien; both are pointedly deliberate in their portrayals.  In any regard, this is high melodrama so realism has no part in it.  Elizabeth Taylor, on the other hand, as Amy March, was at least fun to watch playing an unrepentant self-centered ninny who constantly ate but never grew fat (there's a neat trick!).  And Mary Astor as Marmee March is always elegant and grand.  For the most part, the rest of the cast is there primarily to serve as June Allyson's foils; they don't get much of an opportunity to shine on their own as she hogs the film from start to finish.  Not being a fan of hers, I found it difficult to watch her strutting about trying to be a tomboy but coming across as a bully instead, one who rode roughshod over her entire family.  It was Jo's way or the highway.  (Never having read the book, I have no idea if the character was meant to be this controlling/abrasive).

June Allyson who plays Jo was in her 30's when they filmed this!  My husband came in while I was watching it and asked me if she was Marmee!  I didn't like her portrayal of Jo either- I think Katherine Hepburn and Winona Ryder did a much better job of showing Jo's sensitive side (b/c she did have one) along with her bold and tomboyish qualities.  I never understood why Laurie loved her so in this picture- b/c you don't really see them interact that much.  Also, again with the casting, the man (and I say man, not young man) who played Laurie looked much older than he is supposed to be.  Beth also appears to be the baby in the family- she's even a good foot shorter than the other girls- when indeed Amy is the youngest.  It was hard for me to get past the obvious age issues.Then there was the script- first part of the movie stayed pretty true to the book.  Then they crammed the second part into about 30 minutes!  I felt like I was on a train ride, crashing into a wall as they skipped over big scenes and dialogue.  All in all... definitely the lesser of the three Little Women movies.

281948,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,6301971280,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[8, 10]","Louisa May Alcott (1832-1888)was an extremely controversial woman, the product of parents associated with the transcendentalist movement, a rabid abolitionist, an early feminist, and possibly lesbian as well.  Even so, between 1868 and her death she generated a series of novels for juvenile readers which were extremely popular and which continue to be read today.  Easily the most famous of these is LITTLE WOMEN, first published in 1868; it has been adapted to the dramatic stage, to the musical and opera stages; and was filmed no fewer than twelve times during the 20th Century alone.Three of these films have been particularly famous: the 1933 film with Katherine Hepburn; the 1994 film with Winona Ryder; and sandwiched in between them the 1949 version.  Released by MGM and produced and directed by Mervyn LeRoy, like many films of its era it was driven almost exclusively by star power--regardless of whether the actor in question was right for the role or not--and given every bright and colorful visual possible--whether it was appropriate or not.The story, of course, focuses on the March girls, four daughters growing up during the Civil War under their mother's care while their father, a Union Chaplin, is away at the front.  Meg (Janet Leigh) is the oldest and perhaps most sensible; Jo (June Allyson) is headstrong, boyish, and very determined to be a writer; Amy (Elizabeth Taylor) is beautiful but vain and affected; and Beth (Margaret O'Brien), the youngest, is of a noble but extremely shy disposition.  Mother ""Marmee"" is played by the always memorable Mary Astor; father Mr. March is played by Leon Ames; and the supporting cast includes Lucille Watson, Peter Lawford, and Rossano Brazzi.The 1949 LITTLE WOMEN isn't in the least plausible: the actresses are much too different in coloring and build to be believeable as mother and daughters, and although Mary Astor, Leon Ames, and Lucille Watson score extremely well in their performances, the rest of the cast tends to overplay wildly.  Of the sisters, Janet Leigh is easily the most believeable.  June Allyson is seen here at her most brash, Elizabeth Taylor is truly jaw-dropping in a blonde wig, and Margaret O'Brien too often veers into a sticky-sweetness.  And yet, curiously, the whole really does work and is tremendously entertaining, the sort of thing we mean when we talk about ""a good old-fashioned fun film.""Although the script leaves a lot to be desired, the story presented here is really closer to the book than the 1933 and 1994 films, and it has considerable power and authority; in watching it, you get the feeling that of all the many film versions, this is the one that Louisa May Alcott herself would have liked best.  The Technicolor images are typically over the top, seeming overdone in the austere Marsh home but very on target elsewhere, and the production values are MGM at its most glossy.  Mervyn Le Roy is hardly in the same league with George Cukor (neither is Gillian Armstrong for that matter), but he keeps the show moving at fast clip, and in the end it is extremely enjoyable if somewhat shallow fun.  The DVD is ""good"" rather than fine--but whatever the case, it's a lot of fun.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",4,A Good Old Fashioned Fun Film,1197072000,"12 8, 2007",2007,3210,"['Louisa', 'May', 'Alcott', '1832-1888', 'was', 'extremely', 'controversial', 'woman', 'product', 'parents', 'associated', 'transcendentalist', 'movement', 'rabid', 'abolitionist', 'early', 'feminist', 'possibly', 'lesbian', 'well', 'Even', 'so', '1868', 'death', 'generated', 'series', 'novels', 'juvenile', 'readers', 'were', 'extremely', 'popular', 'continue', 'be', 'read', 'today', 'Easily', 'most', 'famous', 'LITTLE', 'WOMEN', 'first', 'published', '1868', 'been', 'adapted', 'dramatic', 'stage', 'musical', 'opera', 'stages', 'was', 'filmed', 'no', 'fewer', 'twelve', 'times', '20th', 'Century', 'alone.Three', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'particularly', 'famous', '1933', 'film', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', '1994', 'film', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'sandwiched', '1949', 'version', 'Released', 'MGM', 'produced', 'directed', 'Mervyn', 'LeRoy', 'many', 'films', 'era', 'was', 'driven', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'star', 'power', 'regardless', 'actor', 'question', 'was', 'right', 'role', 'not', 'given', 'bright', 'colorful', 'visual', 'possible', 'was', 'appropriate', 'not.The', 'story', 'course', 'March', 'girls', 'four', 'daughters', 'growing', 'up', 'Civil', 'War', 'mother', 'care', 'father', 'Union', 'Chaplin', 'away', 'front', 'Meg', 'Janet', 'Leigh', 'oldest', 'perhaps', 'most', 'sensible', 'Jo', 'June', 'Allyson', 'headstrong', 'boyish', 'very', 'determined', 'be', 'writer', 'Amy', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'beautiful', 'vain', 'affected', 'Beth', 'Margaret', ""O'Brien"", 'youngest', 'noble', 'extremely', 'shy', 'disposition', 'Marmee', 'played', 'always', 'memorable', 'Mary', 'Astor', 'Mr.', 'March', 'played', 'Leon', 'Ames', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Lucille', 'Watson', 'Peter', 'Lawford', 'Rossano', 'Brazzi.The', '1949', 'LITTLE', 'WOMEN', ""n't"", 'least', 'plausible', 'actresses', 'are', 'much', 'too', 'different', 'coloring', 'build', 'be', 'believeable', 'mother', 'daughters', 'Mary', 'Astor', 'Leon', 'Ames', 'Lucille', 'Watson', 'score', 'extremely', 'well', 'performances', 'rest', 'cast', 'overplay', 'wildly', 'sisters', 'Janet', 'Leigh', 'easily', 'most', 'believeable', 'June', 'Allyson', 'seen', 'here', 'most', 'brash', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'truly', 'jaw-dropping', 'blonde', 'wig', 'Margaret', ""O'Brien"", 'too', 'often', 'sticky-sweetness', 'yet', 'curiously', 'whole', 'really', 'work', 'tremendously', 'entertaining', 'sort', 'thing', 'mean', 'when', 'talk', 'good', 'old-fashioned', 'fun', 'film', 'script', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'story', 'presented', 'here', 'really', 'closer', 'book', '1933', '1994', 'films', 'considerable', 'power', 'authority', 'watching', 'get', 'feeling', 'many', 'film', 'versions', 'one', 'Louisa', 'May', 'Alcott', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'best', 'Technicolor', 'images', 'are', 'typically', 'top', 'seeming', 'overdone', 'austere', 'Marsh', 'home', 'very', 'target', 'elsewhere', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'MGM', 'most', 'glossy', 'Mervyn', 'Le', 'Roy', 'hardly', 'same', 'league', 'George', 'Cukor', 'Gillian', 'Armstrong', 'matter', 'show', 'moving', 'fast', 'clip', 'end', 'extremely', 'enjoyable', 'somewhat', 'shallow', 'fun', 'DVD', 'good', 'rather', 'fine', 'case', 'lot', 'fun.GFT', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",Little Women VHS

Mary Astor is memorable as Marmee and Leon Ames gives a brief, but noble, characterization as their father. Rossano Brazzi is charismatic as Professor Behr and his scenes with June Allyson are a joy to behold.  All of the Alcott sentiment is here, which tugs at the heartstrings, and the scenes with Beth and Laurie's grandfather (Sir C. Aubrey Smith) are about as sensitive and touching as as we have seen on the cinematic screen.Mervyn Leroy has given us a tapestry of delicate shading in each scene which comes across as a series of priceless paintings all gathered into one portfolio--and technicolor has never looked so good.

Previous reviewers have commented on the anachronisms in Winona's by having the little women and Marmee talking feminism, something completely absent from Alcott's book. The only other serious contender, of course, would be Hepburn's version, and indeed, if you read the reviews of that movie, authors state categorically that Kate's is better than June's. If you had asked me about that earlier, I might have agreed with you. However, one night I conducted a &quot;Little Women&quot; marathon, whereby I rented both and showed them back to back. While I would say that Kate is the better Jo (but June is fine too),  this 1949 version is better. For one thing, I like the casting better. I knew every woman playing the March sisters as well as Marmee very well from other works. Mary Astor's Marmee, together with Leon Ames as Mr. March when he finally returns from the Civil War, make good solid dependable parents. They were also the parents to Judy Garland's family in &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot;, but here Leon doesn't get a hard time from everyone like in that movie. The standout among the other March sisters is Elizabeth Taylor's blond performance as Amy. She brings the right amount of petulance and vanity to the role. Janet Leigh plays a sweet and demure Meg. I've never liked Margaret O'Brien, period, but she's okay here; fortunately, Beth doesn't make it through to the end of the movie, so I didn't have to see more of Ms. O'Brien than I had to. Peter Lawford makes a good Laurie, a good foil to June's Jo. And I was very pleased to see Dr. Baher upgraded to Rosanno Brazzi--now I could finally understand why Jo chooses the German (yes, I know RB is Italian) tutor over rich boy Laurie.  By the way, one of my other discoveries from my comparison of the two most famous versions back to back was that the same score was used in both, as was the same screenplay--after all, both MGM. I noticed that the professional reviewer at top complained about this script--well, it's the same one he heard in Kate's too!",4,"Winner, Best OVERALL Production of &quot;Little Women&quot;",995673600,"07 21, 2001",2001,2145,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'one', 'Katharine', 'Hepburn', 'Susan', 'Dey', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'one', 'PBS', 'OVERALL', 'best', 'one', 'Previous', 'reviewers', 'have', 'commented', 'anachronisms', 'Winona', 'having', 'little', 'women', 'Marmee', 'talking', 'feminism', 'something', 'completely', 'absent', 'Alcott', 'book', 'only', 'other', 'serious', 'contender', 'course', 'would', 'be', 'Hepburn', 'version', 'indeed', 'read', 'reviews', 'movie', 'authors', 'state', 'categorically', 'Kate', 'better', 'June', 'had', 'asked', 'earlier', 'might', 'have', 'agreed', 'However', 'one', 'night', 'conducted', 'quot', 'Little', 'Women', 'quot', 'whereby', 'rented', 'showed', 'back', 'back', 'would', 'say', 'Kate', 'better', 'Jo', 'June', 'fine', 'too', '1949', 'version', 'better', 'one', 'thing', 'like', 'casting', 'better', 'knew', 'woman', 'playing', 'March', 'sisters', 'as', 'well', 'Marmee', 'very', 'well', 'other', 'works', 'Mary', 'Astor', 'Marmee', 'together', 'Leon', 'Ames', 'Mr.', 'March', 'when', 'finally', 'Civil', 'War', 'make', 'good', 'solid', 'dependable', 'parents', 'were', 'also', 'parents', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'family', 'quot', 'Meet', 'Me', 'St.', 'Louis', 'quot', 'here', 'Leon', ""n't"", 'get', 'hard', 'time', 'everyone', 'movie', 'standout', 'other', 'March', 'sisters', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'blond', 'performance', 'Amy', 'right', 'amount', 'petulance', 'vanity', 'role', 'Janet', 'Leigh', 'sweet', 'demure', 'Meg', ""'ve"", 'never', 'liked', 'Margaret', ""O'Brien"", 'period', 'okay', 'here', 'fortunately', 'Beth', ""n't"", 'make', 'end', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'see', 'more', 'Ms.', ""O'Brien"", 'had', 'Peter', 'Lawford', 'good', 'Laurie', 'good', 'foil', 'June', 'Jo', 'was', 'very', 'pleased', 'see', 'Dr.', 'Baher', 'upgraded', 'Rosanno', 'Brazzi', 'now', 'could', 'finally', 'understand', 'why', 'Jo', 'German', 'yes', 'know', 'RB', 'Italian', 'tutor', 'rich', 'boy', 'Laurie', 'way', 'one', 'other', 'discoveries', 'comparison', 'two', 'most', 'famous', 'versions', 'back', 'back', 'was', 'same', 'score', 'was', 'used', 'was', 'same', 'screenplay', 'MGM', 'noticed', 'professional', 'reviewer', 'top', 'complained', 'script', 'well', 'same', 'one', 'heard', 'Kate', 'too']",Little Women VHS

281973,A1M9DQDGE07Q0U,6301971280,Nix Pix,"[8, 9]","&quot;Little Women&quot; (1949) is the delightful coming of age story that follows the exploits of the March sisters, Jo (June Allyson), Beth (Margaret O?Brien), Amy (Elizabeth Taylor) and Meg (Janet Leigh) as they mature from the angst of childhood into their unsuspecting futures as young women of merit and substance. Jo is a tomboy, defying all convention and propriety in her quest to live a life of enchantment and excitement. That excitement leads Jo first into the arms of the very wealthy, Theodore (Peter Lawford), who she rejects, then the penniless, but infinitely better suited, Professor Bhaer (Rossano Brazzi), who eventually wins her heart. This was the second time Louisa May Alcott's novel had been filmed - the first, in Technicolor. As Jo, June Allyson?s performance holds up quite well against Katherine Hepburn?s indelible original. Allyson is properly pert, plucky and disdainful all at once. She makes the part her own. Mary Astor is tender as Mrs. March. Also in the cast is C. Aubrey Smith, making his final screen appearance as the stoic but loveable Mr. James Lawrence and veteran curmudgeon, Lucille Watson as Aunt March. This is a wonderful tale no matter the age and the acting in this version is perhaps the finest ever realized.Warner Video gives us an absolutely gorgeous looking transfer.

281975,A2JLK1SQ8O03EO,6301971280,octobercountry,"[1, 2]","The classic Victorian novel ""Little Women"" has been filmed quite a few times over the past century; out of the lot there are four noteworthy adaptations, dating from 1933, 1949, 1978, and 1994. I don't think there really is a definitive version; each film adaptation has its own strengths and weaknesses.This evening I viewed the 1949 version, and I'd say it's a solid, though perhaps unexceptional, film. It's certainly gorgeous to look at, getting the glossy MGM Technicolor treatment typical of the period. And the casting isn't bad for the most part; the four girls are played by Janet Leigh (Meg), June Allyson (Jo), Elizabeth Taylor (Amy), and Margaret O'Brien (Beth), with Laurie portrayed by Peter Lawford. I suppose the primary drawback to the casting is that they all seem too old for their parts (with the exception of Margaret O'Brien); June was only 11 years younger than Mary Astor, who played her mother! The only real dud was Richard Wyler as John Brooke, though there has been considerable debate among fans about Elizabeth Taylor's acting in this---some people think she was great, and others think she was simply terrible. I suppose I'm somewhere in the middle regarding her performance, but I will say that her blonde wig wasn't particularly convincing.(Speaking of hair, the one rather glaring anachronism was Jo's hairstyle---with her bangs, she looked very modern to me. After I watched the film I even did little research on 1860's hairstyles, and I see they were rather severe as a rule, with not a bang in sight---hair parted in the centre and pulled back tightly was the rule of the day.)This movie really was more of a remake of the 1933 version, rather than a completely new screenplay using the original novel as its source. Even the main musical themes used in the background scoring were taken from the older film. Oh, there's nothing wrong with that, but it might have been nice to see a fresher take on the story.It was a decent enough film, but for me there was an indefinable something that was missing---it didn't really draw me in on an emotional level. June (as Jo) was pretty good, though I have to say that I still think the very best Jo was young Katharine Hepburn, back in 1933. And out of the four films, the 1994 version remains my favourite.Still, this is worth a viewing for anyone with an interest in golden age Hollywood, or the original Lousia May Alcott story, and I'll recommend it.(I couldn't help but notice that every film version of Little Women that I've ever seen has had extremely similar interior/exterior sets for the March family home. That's because the set designers in each case used Orchard House, the real Alcott family home, as their inspiration.)",4,Solid but unexceptional,1271462400,"04 17, 2010",2010,2715,"['classic', 'Victorian', 'novel', 'Little', 'Women', 'been', 'filmed', 'quite', 'few', 'times', 'past', 'century', 'lot', 'are', 'four', 'noteworthy', 'adaptations', 'dating', '1933', '1949', '1978', '1994', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'really', 'definitive', 'version', 'film', 'adaptation', 'own', 'strengths', 'weaknesses.This', 'evening', 'viewed', '1949', 'version', ""'d"", 'say', 'solid', 'perhaps', 'unexceptional', 'film', 'certainly', 'gorgeous', 'look', 'getting', 'glossy', 'MGM', 'Technicolor', 'treatment', 'typical', 'period', 'casting', ""n't"", 'bad', 'most', 'part', 'four', 'girls', 'are', 'played', 'Janet', 'Leigh', 'Meg', 'June', 'Allyson', 'Jo', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'Amy', 'Margaret', ""O'Brien"", 'Beth', 'Laurie', 'portrayed', 'Peter', 'Lawford', 'suppose', 'primary', 'drawback', 'casting', 'seem', 'too', 'old', 'parts', 'exception', 'Margaret', ""O'Brien"", 'June', 'was', 'only', '11', 'years', 'younger', 'Mary', 'Astor', 'who', 'played', 'mother', 'only', 'real', 'dud', 'was', 'Richard', 'Wyler', 'John', 'Brooke', 'been', 'considerable', 'debate', 'fans', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'acting', '-some', 'people', 'think', 'was', 'great', 'others', 'think', 'was', 'simply', 'terrible', 'suppose', ""'m"", 'somewhere', 'middle', 'regarding', 'performance', 'will', 'say', 'blonde', 'wig', 'was', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'convincing', 'Speaking', 'hair', 'one', 'rather', 'glaring', 'anachronism', 'was', 'Jo', 'hairstyle', 'bangs', 'looked', 'very', 'modern', 'watched', 'film', 'even', 'did', 'little', 'research', '1860', 'hairstyles', 'see', 'were', 'rather', 'severe', 'rule', 'not', 'bang', 'sight', '-hair', 'parted', 'centre', 'pulled', 'back', 'tightly', 'was', 'rule', 'day', 'movie', 'really', 'was', 'more', 'remake', '1933', 'version', 'rather', 'completely', 'new', 'screenplay', 'using', 'original', 'novel', 'source', 'Even', 'main', 'musical', 'themes', 'used', 'background', 'scoring', 'were', 'taken', 'older', 'film', 'Oh', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'fresher', 'take', 'story.It', 'was', 'decent', 'enough', 'film', 'was', 'indefinable', 'something', 'was', 'missing', '-it', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'draw', 'emotional', 'level', 'June', 'Jo', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'have', 'say', 'still', 'think', 'very', 'best', 'Jo', 'was', 'young', 'Katharine', 'Hepburn', 'back', '1933', 'four', 'films', '1994', 'version', 'favourite.Still', 'viewing', 'anyone', 'interest', 'golden', 'age', 'Hollywood', 'original', 'Lousia', 'May', 'Alcott', 'story', ""'ll"", 'recommend', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'notice', 'film', 'version', 'Little', 'Women', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'had', 'extremely', 'similar', 'interior/exterior', 'sets', 'March', 'family', 'home', 'set', 'designers', 'case', 'used', 'Orchard', 'House', 'real', 'Alcott', 'family', 'home', 'inspiration']",Little Women VHS

Lane,"[2, 3]","Having been raised on the 1990's version of the film, it was delightful seeing so many of the actual scenes from Alcott's novel acted out, but I find myself wishing that elements from both films were combined. The Marmee in this version gives her words of wisdom less naturally than good ol' ""Suze"" in the newer one with Winona Ryder. It sounds like she's making a speech. It was also strange to have Amy older than Beth, though Elizabeth Taylor definately gives 100% to the role. June Allison, it was interesting to see, really brought out Jo's aggressiveness, whereas Ryder brought out mostly her awkwardness. But they really could have done better potraying Jo's romance with the professor, and Amy's romance with Laurie in the 1949 version. Might I add: If you've ever read the book, you'd know Jo and Laurie's relationship was A LOT more playful than mushy. The newer version did a great job with Christian Bail as Laurie, and they at leaste tried to explain how Laurie came to see that he was really meant to be with Amy. All this said, I like both, but they draw out different emotions in me. The old is lighter, makes me smile and laugh. The new makes me laugh at times, too . . . but I see in it an element of poignancy, of pathos, that the 1949 film misses.",4,"Faithful to original theme, but underdeveloped characters",1167350400,"12 29, 2006",2006,1267,"['Having', 'been', 'raised', '1990', 'version', 'film', 'was', 'delightful', 'seeing', 'so', 'many', 'actual', 'scenes', 'Alcott', 'novel', 'acted', 'out', 'find', 'wishing', 'elements', 'films', 'were', 'combined', 'Marmee', 'version', 'words', 'wisdom', 'less', 'naturally', 'good', 'ol', 'Suze', 'newer', 'one', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'making', 'speech', 'was', 'also', 'strange', 'have', 'Amy', 'older', 'Beth', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'definately', '100', '%', 'role', 'June', 'Allison', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'really', 'brought', 'out', 'Jo', 'aggressiveness', 'whereas', 'Ryder', 'brought', 'out', 'mostly', 'awkwardness', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'potraying', 'Jo', 'romance', 'professor', 'Amy', 'romance', 'Laurie', '1949', 'version', 'Might', 'add', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'read', 'book', ""'d"", 'know', 'Jo', 'Laurie', 'relationship', 'was', 'LOT', 'more', 'playful', 'mushy', 'newer', 'version', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'Christian', 'Bail', 'Laurie', 'leaste', 'tried', 'explain', 'how', 'Laurie', 'came', 'see', 'was', 'really', 'meant', 'be', 'Amy', 'said', 'like', 'draw', 'out', 'different', 'emotions', 'old', 'lighter', 'smile', 'laugh', 'new', 'laugh', 'times', 'too', 'see', 'element', 'poignancy', 'pathos', '1949', 'film', 'misses']",Little Women VHS

281996,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,6301971280,Z Hayes,"[0, 0]","The 1949 movie adaptation of Little Women is my favorite screen version and also one of the most gorgeous adaptations! The story of the four March sisters - Meg [Janet Leigh], Jo [June Allyson], Beth [Margaret O'Brien], and Amy [Elizabeth Taylor] and their mother, Marmie is a classic story that has held its appeal all these years. It's a human drama that is a blend of the comic and tragic and will have sensitive viewers reaching for their hankies during some of the heart-rending scenes [one of the sisters dies].June Allyson shines as the strong-willed Jo March who dreams of becoming an author and whose feminist ideas are convincingly [though by no means overbearing] portrayed.Elizabeth Taylor's performance as Amy is the best of all the movie adaptations - and her 'growth' from a petulant child to a genteel young woman is very credibly done. Peter Lawford as their next-door neighbor, Laurie is credible but lacks the dashing looks of Christian Bale. This is not important however, as what I liked about Peter Lawford's performance here is the lack of chemistry between him and Allyson, which is apt considering Jo only thinks of Laurie as a brother/friend. I loved Rossano Brazzi's performance as Professor Bhaer [ok, perhaps he was too good-looking to make a credible Bhaer, but his character portrayal was excellent].Watching this version in its full Technicolor production is a visual delight and will enthrall all fans of the classic novel as well as those who love period dramas.",5,My favorite screen adaptation of Little Women!,1229299200,"12 15, 2008",2008,1496,"['1949', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'Little', 'Women', 'favorite', 'screen', 'version', 'also', 'one', 'most', 'gorgeous', 'adaptations', 'story', 'four', 'March', 'sisters', 'Meg', '[', 'Janet', 'Leigh', ']', 'Jo', '[', 'June', 'Allyson', ']', 'Beth', '[', 'Margaret', ""O'Brien"", ']', 'Amy', '[', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', ']', 'mother', 'Marmie', 'classic', 'story', 'held', 'appeal', 'years', 'human', 'drama', 'blend', 'comic', 'tragic', 'will', 'have', 'sensitive', 'viewers', 'reaching', 'hankies', 'heart-rending', 'scenes', '[', 'one', 'sisters', ']', '.June', 'Allyson', 'shines', 'strong-willed', 'Jo', 'March', 'who', 'becoming', 'author', 'feminist', 'ideas', 'are', 'convincingly', '[', 'means', 'overbearing', ']', 'portrayed.Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'performance', 'Amy', 'best', 'movie', 'adaptations', ""'growth"", 'petulant', 'child', 'genteel', 'young', 'woman', 'very', 'credibly', 'done', 'Peter', 'Lawford', 'next-door', 'neighbor', 'Laurie', 'credible', 'dashing', 'looks', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'not', 'important', 'however', 'what', 'liked', 'Peter', 'Lawford', 'performance', 'here', 'lack', 'chemistry', 'Allyson', 'apt', 'considering', 'Jo', 'only', 'Laurie', 'brother/friend', 'loved', 'Rossano', 'Brazzi', 'performance', 'Professor', 'Bhaer', '[', 'ok', 'perhaps', 'was', 'too', 'good-looking', 'make', 'credible', 'Bhaer', 'character', 'portrayal', 'was', 'excellent', ']', '.Watching', 'version', 'full', 'Technicolor', 'production', 'visual', 'delight', 'will', 'enthrall', 'fans', 'classic', 'novel', 'as', 'well', 'who', 'love', 'period', 'dramas']",Little Women VHS
