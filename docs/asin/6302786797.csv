333789,A15GES70P0P0QC,6302786797,Christoph Gassenschmidt,"[8, 9]","This movie will appeal to all people who have &quot;a couple&quot; of years of marriage behind them. It is a story of a family falling apart as &quot;love has come to its conclusion&quot;. After 27 years of marriage time has changed: All the members of the family still love each other but in different ways. Mother and father live apart but still respect each other. The two daughters slowly find their own way - one through pregnancy, the other through the painful teen years.Do not expect a stringent story line. This are rather various shots of family life - but well taken. Here, the talks between the father and his younger daughter stick out, especially when the father admits to his daughter that he had never found a way to talk to her as her mother had monopolized her. And he confesses that if she would have been a son it might have been different. But now that the mother was gone he finally came to appreciate having a daughter (in fact he has two).Younger people might not enjoy the film as they will not (no offence) understand the message of the film.Also recommendable: the wonderful scenary of the South Carolinian coast area. Wonderful impressions. A film with a lot of emotions.So, if you are 35 and above, have children and ... buy the film.",5,Wonderful movie,1017532800,"03 31, 2002",2002,1263,"['movie', 'will', 'appeal', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'quot', 'couple', 'quot', 'years', 'marriage', 'story', 'family', 'falling', 'apart', 'quot', 'love', 'come', 'conclusion', 'quot', '27', 'years', 'marriage', 'time', 'changed', 'members', 'family', 'still', 'love', 'other', 'different', 'ways', 'Mother', 'father', 'live', 'apart', 'still', 'respect', 'other', 'two', 'daughters', 'slowly', 'find', 'own', 'way', 'one', 'pregnancy', 'other', 'painful', 'teen', 'years.Do', 'not', 'expect', 'stringent', 'story', 'line', 'are', 'rather', 'various', 'shots', 'family', 'life', 'well', 'taken', 'Here', 'talks', 'father', 'younger', 'daughter', 'stick', 'out', 'especially', 'when', 'father', 'daughter', 'had', 'never', 'found', 'way', 'talk', 'mother', 'had', 'monopolized', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'son', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'different', 'now', 'mother', 'was', 'gone', 'finally', 'came', 'appreciate', 'having', 'daughter', 'fact', 'two', '.Younger', 'people', 'might', 'not', 'enjoy', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'offence', 'understand', 'message', 'film.Also', 'recommendable', 'wonderful', 'scenary', 'South', 'Carolinian', 'coast', 'area', 'Wonderful', 'impressions', 'film', 'lot', 'emotions.So', 'are', '35', 'above', 'have', 'children', 'buy', 'film']",N/A
333790,A33FCLUEQSUD68,6302786797,Claire,"[0, 0]","Was it Thomas Wolfe who said you can't go home again? Well maybe that's true but if you never left it in the first place then it becomes a moot point. I collect movies filmed in and around Charleston, S.C. because that is where I was born and raised (and still live.) The actual place this movie was filmed was the Old Village of Mt. Pleasant- a town across the river from Charleston. To me that is the real star of this movie- its location- and as they say sometimes: location is everything. Moviegoers may even recognize the setting of the movie is the same neighborhood as ""The Notebook"" since both movies were filmed here, although more than 10 years apart and 50 years in movie time.Anyway, ""Rich In Love"" is based on Josephine Humphreys' novel of the same name and seems to do a good job of portraying the novel accurately- something movies or movie-makers rarely seem to be able to do. The story is simple enough and one of the strengths of the movie is that the characters seem real enough to be believable without being absurd. Albert Finney is always incredible and his performance as the clueless father and husband here is flawless. Kate Erbe and Suzy Amis play his daughters each struggling in different ways with their identity and love lives. Piper Laurie and Jill Clayburgh are also a treat to watch, as is Alfre Woodard, and seeing young Ethan Hawke and Kyle Maclachlin round out the cast makes the movie all the more enjoyable. This is just a sweet little movie that keeps it simple by focusing on the relationships within a somewhat dysfunctional Southern family. It could easily be a Tennessee Williams play.As for the dvd, there is absolutely nothing bonus on it and I mean Nada Colada. There isn't even a main menu so no subtitle options. You don't even have to press play since the movie just starts playing once you put it into your dvd player. MGM didn't even put the movie poster picture on the front of the box- it just has the MGM lion on the front. So no frills. The price is also a bit steep- I think it was about $20 which is about $13 more than I usually allow myself to spend on dvds. However, as I said before, I collect movies filmed here so it was worth it to me. But I wouldn't recommend buying this flick unless you have good reason. The movie itself is good but not exactly worth the money is costs.",5,Home is where the heart is...,1373328000,"07 9, 2013",2013,2338,"['Thomas', 'Wolfe', 'who', 'said', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'home', 'again', 'Well', 'maybe', 'true', 'never', 'left', 'first', 'place', 'then', 'moot', 'point', 'collect', 'movies', 'filmed', 'Charleston', 'S.C.', 'where', 'was', 'born', 'raised', 'still', 'live', 'actual', 'place', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'was', 'Old', 'Village', 'Mt', 'Pleasant-', 'town', 'river', 'Charleston', 'real', 'star', 'movie-', 'location-', 'say', 'sometimes', 'location', 'everything', 'Moviegoers', 'may', 'even', 'recognize', 'setting', 'movie', 'same', 'neighborhood', 'Notebook', 'movies', 'were', 'filmed', 'here', 'more', '10', 'years', 'apart', '50', 'years', 'movie', 'time.Anyway', 'Rich', 'Love', 'based', 'Josephine', 'Humphreys', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'novel', 'accurately-', 'something', 'movies', 'movie-makers', 'rarely', 'seem', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'story', 'simple', 'enough', 'one', 'strengths', 'movie', 'characters', 'seem', 'real', 'enough', 'be', 'believable', 'being', 'absurd', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'always', 'incredible', 'performance', 'clueless', 'father', 'husband', 'here', 'flawless', 'Kate', 'Erbe', 'Suzy', 'Amis', 'play', 'daughters', 'struggling', 'different', 'ways', 'identity', 'love', 'lives', 'Piper', 'Laurie', 'Jill', 'Clayburgh', 'are', 'also', 'treat', 'watch', 'Alfre', 'Woodard', 'seeing', 'young', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'Kyle', 'Maclachlin', 'round', 'out', 'cast', 'movie', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'just', 'sweet', 'little', 'movie', 'simple', 'focusing', 'relationships', 'somewhat', 'dysfunctional', 'Southern', 'family', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'play.As', 'dvd', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'bonus', 'mean', 'Nada', 'Colada', ""n't"", 'even', 'main', 'menu', 'so', 'no', 'subtitle', 'options', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'press', 'play', 'movie', 'just', 'playing', 'once', 'put', 'dvd', 'player', 'MGM', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'put', 'movie', 'poster', 'picture', 'front', 'box-', 'just', 'MGM', 'lion', 'front', 'frills', 'price', 'also', 'bit', 'steep-', 'think', 'was', 'about', '20', '13', 'more', 'usually', 'allow', 'spend', 'dvds', 'However', 'said', 'collect', 'movies', 'filmed', 'here', 'was', 'worth', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'buying', 'flick', 'have', 'good', 'reason', 'movie', 'good', 'not', 'exactly', 'money', 'costs']",N/A

I am not giving anything away here as that is how the movie opens, not ends.

333793,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,6302786797,Gregor von Kallahann,"[8, 8]","RICH IN LOVE boasts a great ensemble cast, but it's probably not a disservice to the other actors in this 1993 heartwarmer to say that the film BELONGS to Albert Finney.  To say nothing of the fact that his is absolutely the best Southern accent of any of the non-(US)Southern born actors in the film.  What is it about the Brits ready mastery of Dixiespeak anyway? OK, OK, aside from Albert Finney in this movie, I can actually only think of Vivien Leigh's flawless turn as Miz Scarlett in 1939.  But still.So maybe it has more to do with being a huge talent than with one's nationality.  Interesting that such solid performers as Piper Laurie and Jill Clayburgh kind of wander in and out of their accents.  Finney, however, is just about perfection here.  And not just linguistically.  He inhabits his role as the chronically perplexed retiree Warren Odom, who is attempting make sense of his wife's sudden abandonment of him and his high school aged daughter (Kathryn Erbe).  More oblivious than truly insensitive, he ultimately has to come to terms with the fact that although he and his wife still love each other in their way, after 27 years, they can no longer live together.Erbe also turns in a remarkable performance--especially considering that the actress, who was in her mid-twenties at the time the film was made, so convincingly plays a precocious high school senior. Also impressive is the film's one true Southerner, Suzy Amis as her impetuous newly wed (and ambivalently pregnant) sister.  It's a lovingly dysfunctional Southern family, one that ultimately comes together in its clumsy, lopsided way.  No easy answers here, but everybody grows up a little bit over the course of the film's two hours.  And maybe that's the best you can hope for.RICH IN LOVE doesn't make any grandiose statements, and that's all to the good. It's one of those ""little movies"" that somehow manages to reveal a few great truths about the  human condition.  And it offers a great performance by Albert Finney.  Coincidentally, I recently also caught his follow-up film, THE BROWNING VERSION, as well.  It's difficult to imagine two more divergent roles than the garrulous Southerner he plays here and the reserved English Classics teacher he portrayed in the latter film.  He has a remarkable range, one that goes beyond a mere facility in mastering accents.  His is a much deeper mastery indeed.Nominated five times for an Academy Award, Finney has never won.  His last nomination was in 2000 for a solid but certainly not stellar turn in ERIN BROCKOVICH.  I guess neither RICH IN LOVE nor THE BROWNING VERSION were big enough to merit the Academy's attention, but his work in both those films was infinitely more subtle, and at the same time more commanding, than his role as Julia Roberts' boss in that megahit.And people ask me why I don't take the Oscars seriously.",4,Star Turn For Albert Finney,1119225600,"06 20, 2005",2005,2867,"['RICH', 'IN', 'LOVE', 'great', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'probably', 'not', 'disservice', 'other', 'actors', '1993', 'heartwarmer', 'say', 'film', 'BELONGS', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'say', 'nothing', 'fact', 'absolutely', 'best', 'Southern', 'accent', 'non-', 'US', 'Southern', 'born', 'actors', 'film', 'What', 'Brits', 'ready', 'mastery', 'Dixiespeak', 'anyway', 'OK', 'OK', 'aside', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'movie', 'can', 'actually', 'only', 'think', 'Vivien', 'Leigh', 'flawless', 'turn', 'Miz', 'Scarlett', '1939', 'still.So', 'maybe', 'more', 'do', 'being', 'huge', 'talent', 'one', 'nationality', 'Interesting', 'such', 'solid', 'performers', 'Piper', 'Laurie', 'Jill', 'Clayburgh', 'kind', 'wander', 'accents', 'Finney', 'however', 'just', 'perfection', 'here', 'not', 'just', 'linguistically', 'role', 'chronically', 'perplexed', 'retiree', 'Warren', 'Odom', 'who', 'attempting', 'make', 'sense', 'wife', 'sudden', 'abandonment', 'high', 'school', 'aged', 'daughter', 'Kathryn', 'Erbe', 'More', 'oblivious', 'truly', 'insensitive', 'ultimately', 'come', 'terms', 'fact', 'wife', 'still', 'love', 'other', 'way', '27', 'years', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'live', 'together.Erbe', 'also', 'remarkable', 'performance', 'especially', 'considering', 'actress', 'who', 'was', 'mid-twenties', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'so', 'convincingly', 'precocious', 'high', 'school', 'senior', 'Also', 'impressive', 'film', 'one', 'true', 'Southerner', 'Suzy', 'Amis', 'impetuous', 'newly', 'wed', 'ambivalently', 'pregnant', 'sister', 'lovingly', 'dysfunctional', 'Southern', 'family', 'one', 'ultimately', 'together', 'clumsy', 'lopsided', 'way', 'easy', 'answers', 'here', 'everybody', 'up', 'little', 'bit', 'course', 'film', 'two', 'hours', 'maybe', 'best', 'can', 'hope', 'for.RICH', 'IN', 'LOVE', ""n't"", 'make', 'grandiose', 'statements', 'good', 'one', 'little', 'movies', 'somehow', 'reveal', 'few', 'great', 'truths', 'human', 'condition', 'great', 'performance', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'Coincidentally', 'recently', 'also', 'caught', 'follow-up', 'film', 'THE', 'BROWNING', 'VERSION', 'as', 'well', 'difficult', 'imagine', 'two', 'more', 'divergent', 'roles', 'garrulous', 'Southerner', 'here', 'reserved', 'English', 'Classics', 'portrayed', 'latter', 'film', 'remarkable', 'range', 'one', 'mere', 'facility', 'mastering', 'accents', 'much', 'deeper', 'mastery', 'indeed.Nominated', 'five', 'times', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Finney', 'never', 'won', 'last', 'nomination', 'was', '2000', 'solid', 'certainly', 'not', 'stellar', 'turn', 'ERIN', 'BROCKOVICH', 'guess', 'RICH', 'IN', 'LOVE', 'THE', 'BROWNING', 'VERSION', 'were', 'big', 'enough', 'merit', 'Academy', 'attention', 'work', 'films', 'was', 'infinitely', 'more', 'subtle', 'same', 'time', 'more', 'commanding', 'role', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'boss', 'megahit.And', 'people', 'ask', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'Oscars', 'seriously']",N/A

I get a sense of how she wants everything to stay the same and fights for the permanence of the life she has envisioned.But none of the family members stay the same.  The father, Warren (Albert Finney) gradually begins to move beyond the four walls of the old family home, perfectly portrayed with spreading verandas and live oak trees surrounding it.  His new woman friend (Piper Laurie) is like a breath of fresh air.Meanwhile, his wife Helen (Jill Clayburgh) has moved into an independent life, one that allows for change.When oldest daughter Rae comes home with a new husband, and announces her pregnancy, another change is forced upon them all.Another favorite scene is when Rae, her husband Billy, and Lucille go out to a night club owned by a friend (Alfre Woodard), and Rae gets up to sing.  Her husband is stunned.  He knew nothing about this version of Rae.In fact, the themes of this film are all about change...and how, in spite of what any of them want, change is inevitable.  And not necessarily a bad thing.A feel-good movie that shows that change can bring a richness to life, in spite of one's fears,Rich in Loveis one I'll enjoy watching over and over.I especially loved Finney's portrayal of Warren Odom, as well as Suzy Amis's ability to inhabit the role of Rae Odom.",5,RICH IN SOUTHERN SCENES & LYRICAL LANGUAGE,1332547200,"03 24, 2012",2012,1788,"['first', 'saw', 'movie', 'years', 'ago', 'loved', 'it.What', 'enjoy', 'most', 'film', 'how', 'sleepy', 'seemingly', 'unchanged', 'Southern', 'way', 'life', 'apart', 'slowly', 'family', 'then', 'together', 'again', 'new', 'version.The', 'movie', 'scenes', 'moonlight', 'water', 'there', 'are', 'gifted', 'wonderful', 'moments', 'spotlight', 'relaxed', 'comfortable', 'way', 'life.Youngest', 'daughter', 'Lucille', 'old', 'soul', 'taking', 'care', 'father', 'mother', 'unexpectedly', 'get', 'sense', 'how', 'everything', 'stay', 'same', 'fights', 'permanence', 'life', 'envisioned.But', 'none', 'family', 'members', 'stay', 'same', 'father', 'Warren', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'gradually', 'move', 'four', 'walls', 'old', 'family', 'home', 'perfectly', 'portrayed', 'spreading', 'verandas', 'live', 'oak', 'trees', 'surrounding', 'new', 'woman', 'friend', 'Piper', 'Laurie', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air.Meanwhile', 'wife', 'Helen', 'Jill', 'Clayburgh', 'moved', 'independent', 'life', 'one', 'change.When', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'Rae', 'home', 'new', 'husband', 'pregnancy', 'change', 'forced', 'favorite', 'scene', 'when', 'Rae', 'husband', 'Billy', 'Lucille', 'go', 'out', 'night', 'club', 'owned', 'friend', 'Alfre', 'Woodard', 'Rae', 'up', 'sing', 'husband', 'stunned', 'knew', 'nothing', 'version', 'Rae.In', 'fact', 'themes', 'film', 'are', 'change', 'how', 'spite', 'what', 'want', 'change', 'inevitable', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing.A', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'change', 'can', 'bring', 'richness', 'life', 'spite', 'one', 'fears', 'Rich', 'Loveis', 'one', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'watching', 'over.I', 'especially', 'loved', 'Finney', 'portrayal', 'Warren', 'Odom', 'as', 'well', 'Suzy', 'Amis', 'ability', 'inhabit', 'role', 'Rae', 'Odom']",N/A
