But what I don't get is that in the movies slappy has red hair and eyebrows, but in the books he has black hair and eyebrows. And what I also don't get is that Night of the living dummy 3 and Bride of the living dummy don't go together. Because in Night of the livng dummy 3 Slappy gets shocked by lightning and explodes, but in Bride of the living dummy he's completeley unharmed. I liked the part on Night of the living dummy 3 at the end when Rocky the dummy beats up Slappy and throws him out the window. So the movie is great, funny, and scary.
