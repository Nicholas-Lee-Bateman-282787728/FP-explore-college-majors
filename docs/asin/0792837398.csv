138386,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,0792837398,Acute Observer,"[3, 5]","Wanda Nevada, 1979 filmThe film begins in a watering place in Arizona in the early 1950s. There is a poker game in the back room. Two gamblers bet on a hand. One doesn't have enough cash to cover the bet so he offers a young girl who is a run-a-way from an orphanage. There is conflict over the winner, a gunshot settles the deal. Beaudray Demerol won the cash and the marker, the 13-year old girl. [A lucky number or just Jail Bait?] They leave quickly, then stop at a bar. An old prospector brags about finding gold in the Grand Canyon. ""Everybody knows there is no gold in the Grand Canyon."" But Curly shows off his nuggets! When Curly leaves he drops a pouch with the nuggets, and a watching Wanda scoops it up. Two criminals follow Curly to rob and kill him. Wanda is seen watching them and flees with Beaudray. They are chased by the killers for the usual chase to provide action. Later Beaudray and Wanda stay at a motel where they discover a hidden map to the lost mine!Beau trades his Studebaker for pack mules and supplies to try to find Curly's hidden mine. [They know exactly what they'll need.] The two killers are on their trail! Beau and Wanda stumble upon a rope ladder which is a clue to the cave hidden below the trail. Wanda was taught how to use a pistol. They find the veins of gold in the cave and pick up bags of nuggets. When the two killers find them there is a shoot-out at close range. Many shots are fired but no one is hit! The two killer run off. Will Beau and Wanda discard their winnings? They wake the next morning to find their mules missing. They have to walk out of the desert without food or water. Later they find the bodies of the two killers; someone has passed judgment on them. But Wanda and Beau find the gold nearby! [An amazing coincidence?] Then they find an old boat (!) that will carry them down the river to safety, even after an arrow wounds Beau. [You can't be too lucky in Hollywood movies.] Upon their return to civilization the orphanage tries to reclaim Wanda, but she runs off again to join Beau in his new car. Will they live happily ever after? In Hollywood!The faults in this film is to present two killers as bumblers for comic relief. This is not a serious film, but a comic fantasy that plays with the characters as if this was a cartoon. Robert Louis Stevenson's ""Treasure Island"" was filmed many times, and remains a popular story for children of all ages. Setting it in the past may help its credibility. I see this film as another version where a young orphan is able to become wealthy through good fortune and overcoming perils to grab the gold. No mention of taxes and government claims on the loot! This is a low budget version, no expensive equipment or cast of hundreds was needed.I read a book about the Lost Gold Mines in Arizona. This 1950 book cautioned tourists against wandering away from their hotels unarmed. People who did this somehow disappeared without a trace.

But if you're expecting a typical wholesome romantic western, forget it. This movie is pure trash! The romance is between a YOUNG GIRL who has not even gone through puberty and a MIDDLE-AGED MAN! The child is also lusted after by other leering men. It's sickening.Peter Fonda is portrayed as being virtuous by trying to resist his attraction to Brooke Shields, and her character is mostly the one that pursues the relationship. He tries to shoo her away at first but eventually he gives in and they drive off as a happy, loving couple.

138391,A2Z3643FSM4PAQ,0792837398,Joe Smart,"[1, 1]","A gambler (Peter Fonda) wins a young teen in a card game and the mismatched pair find adventures that eventually lead them to a hunt for gold in the Grand Canyon.It seems very likely that the material was reconfigured to accommodate the sexually charged image Brooke Shields was peddling early in her career (anyone remember The Brooke Book?).  Even though her character is merely thirteen years old a surprising number of male characters in the movie want to get in her pants.  The most impressive stylistic touch involves Shields' character storming off at a truck stop.  The camera follows her in a lateral unbroken shot as she passes a seemingly endless line of men standing in front of their vehicles propositioning her, trying to get her to join them for a little fun.  Later the gambler and Wanda encounter an eccentric bird watcher who turns out to be a pedophile.  Then they are pursued by two gangsters, one of whom mentions several times that when they catch the pair he gets the girl.  When his partner mentions that he's already been married three times the gangster replies that he doesn't plan on marrying her.The weird thing is that if you remove the Brooke Shields as 13 year old sex-pot elements what you are left with is a family friendly adventure film that could have been made by Disney starring Kim Richards and Darrin McGavin.  The violence is so tame that during one shoot out between the gambler, Wanda and the two gangsters dozens of shots are fired but no one is actually wounded--bullets knock off hats and tear clothing but not a single one actually draws blood.Wanda Nevada is ultimately undone by the limitations of its lead actress.  While Brooke Shields is likable enough, she doesn't manage a single honest emotional moment for her character during the entire course of the movie.  She seems content to be sassy, say her lines and hit her marks, but that isn't enough.  Since Wanda comes across as an obvious performance rather than a person it robs the movie of anyone to care about or root for.Brooke Shields wasn't really a very interesting or resourceful actress, which is likely why her big-screen career fizzled completely after Endless Love tanked, despite the massive hype surrounding her.Wanda Nevada is offbeat and has its moments, but its schizophrenic tone and the phony performance from Shields make it hard to recommend.",2,Odd movie,1398384000,"04 25, 2014",2014,2369,"['gambler', 'Peter', 'Fonda', 'young', 'teen', 'card', 'game', 'mismatched', 'pair', 'find', 'adventures', 'eventually', 'lead', 'hunt', 'gold', 'Grand', 'Canyon.It', 'very', 'likely', 'material', 'was', 'reconfigured', 'accommodate', 'sexually', 'charged', 'image', 'Brooke', 'Shields', 'was', 'peddling', 'early', 'career', 'anyone', 'remember', 'Brooke', 'Book', 'Even', 'character', 'merely', 'thirteen', 'years', 'old', 'surprising', 'number', 'male', 'characters', 'movie', 'want', 'get', 'pants', 'most', 'impressive', 'stylistic', 'touch', 'Shields', 'character', 'storming', 'off', 'truck', 'stop', 'camera', 'lateral', 'unbroken', 'shot', 'seemingly', 'endless', 'line', 'men', 'standing', 'front', 'vehicles', 'propositioning', 'trying', 'get', 'join', 'little', 'fun', 'Later', 'gambler', 'Wanda', 'encounter', 'eccentric', 'bird', 'watcher', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'pedophile', 'Then', 'are', 'pursued', 'two', 'gangsters', 'one', 'whom', 'mentions', 'several', 'times', 'when', 'catch', 'pair', 'girl', 'When', 'partner', 'mentions', 'already', 'been', 'married', 'three', 'times', 'gangster', ""n't"", 'plan', 'marrying', 'her.The', 'weird', 'thing', 'remove', 'Brooke', 'Shields', '13', 'year', 'old', 'sex-pot', 'elements', 'what', 'are', 'left', 'family', 'friendly', 'adventure', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'Disney', 'starring', 'Kim', 'Richards', 'Darrin', 'McGavin', 'violence', 'so', 'tame', 'one', 'shoot', 'gambler', 'Wanda', 'two', 'gangsters', 'dozens', 'shots', 'are', 'fired', 'one', 'actually', 'wounded', 'bullets', 'knock', 'hats', 'tear', 'clothing', 'not', 'single', 'one', 'actually', 'blood.Wanda', 'Nevada', 'ultimately', 'undone', 'limitations', 'lead', 'actress', 'Brooke', 'Shields', 'likable', 'enough', ""n't"", 'manage', 'single', 'honest', 'emotional', 'moment', 'character', 'entire', 'course', 'movie', 'content', 'be', 'sassy', 'say', 'lines', 'hit', 'marks', ""n't"", 'enough', 'Wanda', 'across', 'obvious', 'performance', 'rather', 'person', 'movie', 'anyone', 'care', 'root', 'for.Brooke', 'Shields', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'very', 'interesting', 'resourceful', 'actress', 'likely', 'why', 'big-screen', 'career', 'fizzled', 'completely', 'Endless', 'Love', 'tanked', 'massive', 'hype', 'surrounding', 'her.Wanda', 'Nevada', 'offbeat', 'moments', 'schizophrenic', 'tone', 'phony', 'performance', 'Shields', 'make', 'hard', 'recommend']",Wanda Nevada VHS
