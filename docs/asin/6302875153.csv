342682,A3DZ2907IDX7ME,6302875153,A Forest Fan,"[0, 0]","When Rambo III came out in the movie theaters, I am ashamed to say that I went to see that instead of this intense film. The Beast is the truest movie with regards to fighting in Afghanistan that I have ever seen. This movie was filmed in 1988, and was set around the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union. Ironically, this movie could have been released in 2013. Seeing it now, it is so timely that it's eerie.Based on a Los Angeles play, everything in the film is historically accurate. The way the Soviets grew tired of trying to ""liberate"" Afghanistan and resorted to cruel tactics born of Stalingrad. The Afghan tradition of Pashtunwali (look it up on Wikipedia), it's a gripping story.The opening quote by Rudyard Kipling (""The Young British Soldier"") has never gone out of fashion. In fact, if you watch closely from beginning to the end, the entire movie is based on this quote. Without spoiling things, watch the Afghan women in this movie, theirs is not a peripheral role.For those of you who have never been to Afghanistan, the movie accurately captures the heat, the filth, the sweat, and yes, the glory of war. I cheered, laughed, and grimaced at the insanities of war. This is the true Afghanistan. Not bad for a work of fiction based on a play (and filmed in Israel, of all places).Fans of the science fiction movie Stargate, watch for a young Erick Avari playing the Afghan interpreter who works for the tank crew.Back in the eighties, my knowledge of Afghanistan was formed by a few sources like the James Bond film ""The Living Daylights"". I wish I had seen ""The Beast"", it should have been shown to every American soldier before being sent off to a land they knew nothing about. I very highly recommend this film, it ranks up there with the ""war on terror"" works of Kathryn Bigelow (The Hurt Locker, Zero Dark Thirty). I am left asking how could this movie have been made in 1988.

342685,A1IWR4FKPGE95C,6302875153,Carlos Rodriguez,"[4, 4]","The Beast, which is based on the stage play ""Nanawatai"" by William Mastrosimone is a haunting movie with excellent performances from its cast. This film is hard to stomach sometimes due to the violence and bloodshed gore that are in some scenes. Nevertheless, is a very good movie that never had the success it deserved because of poor distrbution from the studio that released it Columbia Pictures.The actors are all excellent with the exception of Jason Patric. I feel that maybe he could've done more with his character he seemed lost or out of place at times. It is strange because I do think that he is a very good actor in other movies he has done. Although he is not bad in this one he is believable most of the times I guess. George Dzunda is excellent as the evil and merciless tank commander. He is really fantastic but at the same time so brutal. It makes you want to hate his character because he is so terribly bad with no feelings or remorse.Steven Bauer (Scarface, Thief Of Hearts) is fantastic as Taj, the Afghan leader who helps Jason Patric take control of the tank and the evil George Dzunda. He delivers all of his lines Pasto (an Afghan dialect) and did an excellent job at it. Bauer is an excellent actor who has never had a chance to play the really good roles. He has done a lot of B-movies that went straight to video but his performance in ""The Beast"" is one of his finest. In reality (my opinion) the reason why this movie is so well done is largely in part because Steven Bauer and George Dzunda are fantastic in their roles.

In the opening scene, a convoy of Soviet tanks attack a small Afghan village and practically level the place and slaughter many of the civilians.  One tank stays behind because the tank commander decides to play a very cruel game with one of the male villagers and gets separated from the rest of the convoy. The lone tank takes a wrong turn and gets lost and is isolated with dwindling fuel and equipment.  A group of the male villagers head after the tank to seek revenge while the women stay behind to bury the dead.  In this movie, the Soviets are portrayed very negatively while the Afghans are portrayed as the heroic good guys up against near impossible odds.  I don't know where they filmed the movie but it sure looked a lot like Afghanistan.  There are lots of shots of the solitary tank in a massive landscape of desolation with no one around.  It really gives you a sense of the sheer isolation and desperation the Soviets feel as the Afghans close in on the hunt.  The performances are very well done.

The movie is very sympathethic to the Afghani freedom fighters (which the US supported back then) and anti war.I saw this movie when it first came out and remember being amazed by it. I bought the DVD recently and re-watched it. The plot is good, the there is a lot of symbolism in the movie - a Soviet lost tank represents all of Russia, getting more and more lost in the deserts of Afghanistan. As the war increases in savagery, the ""civilized"" men become more and more beast like. The more the Soviets try to crush the will of the Afhagni people, the more resistance is built up.In Apocolypse Now, as well as Joseph Conrad's hero, went further and further upstream to meet their fate. In The Beast, the trek is further and further into the desert. What is right and wrong blurs for all who are shown here.

After brutally destroying an Afghan village, a tank takes a wrong turn and is lost in the wilderness.  The Mujahadeen realize it is lost and go after it, trying to track it down and destroy it.Right out of the box, there is a fatal lack of seriousness, because the Mujahadeen speak the local language (and we are given subtitles) whereas the Russians speak English.  Why not let the Muj speak English and give the Russians subtitles?  Or better yet, have each speaking his own language with subtitles for all.This was nevertheless an interesting film, and well made.  The utterly incredible ending, however, goes a long way toward negating the good the film does in its first two thirds of running time.  There is a sub-plot with a Russian POW that doesn't ring true at all.  In fact, it reminds me of George Crile's description, in ""Charlie Wilson's War,"" of a CIA project to try to get Russians to defect.

342695,A3J7J0DIZS8ELH,6302875153,"Douglas Herman ""Douglas Herman""","[3, 4]","The Beast is an excellent, little-publicized war movie about a lesser-publicized war.  A small, tenacious band of CIA trained-and-backed Afghan Mujahedeen fighters (future Taliban and Al Qaida ""terrorists"") wage a cat-and-mouse battle with a Russian tank, armed only with a few AK-47s and a broken RPG.  The opening battle scenes are some of the most harrowing and yet believable caught on film. When I watched the Soviet T-62 tanks smash a poor, remote mountain village, I immediately thought of our attacks on comparable Iraqi villages during both Desert Storm and Operation Iraq Liberation (OIL) as it was once called, by Pentagon planners. Two decades after the Soviets left Afghanistan, here we are again, with BHO about to escalate and add more US troops.  Obviously, no lessons have been learned by our Pentagon war planners from this fantastic old movie--unless they are the wrong ones.  One of the supreme ironies of ""The Beast"" is that it was shot on location in the desert of Israel.  Not surprisingly, our strategy in the Middle East is lifted directly from that of the defeated Soviets and the brutal Israelis.The Beast in the movie is a Soviet T-62 tank, driven with effective brutality by a Russian field commander named Daskal, portrayed by George Dzundza in an Oscar-worthy performance. Daskal has one mission: To literally crush the opposition. If you rent or buy this fine film, you will view an Afghan resistance fighter being purposely crushed to death beneath the tank treads--a frightening reminder of what happened to American Rachel Corrie in Israel. The Beast, you quickly realize, is both the bone-crushing Soviet tank and the bone-crushing viciousness of almost any military occupation.Interestingly, the ""hero""--in Hollywood terms--is a dissident Russian tank mechanic who opposes the brutality of his commander, Daskal. For his sentiments, Koverchenko, played by Jason Patric, is abandoned as a traitor to the elements and the vengeance of our former freedom fighters.  Rescued by them, Daskal turns against his brutal Communist comrades and joins the hunt for the slowly disintegrating tank.  I couldn't watch The Beast--a movie I've seen several times--without thinking that conquering armies learn very little from the examples of other defeated armies before them.  The British and Soviets both followed the Greeks into disaster there, and we are the fourth superpower to try.  The Afghans lost two million people in the ten year war with the Soviets but, thanks to the RPGs and a thousand Stinger missiles provided by the CIA, plus the training of such men as Special Forces Colonel Bo Gritz, they finally defeated the Russians.Does disaster await us in the Middle East? Afghanistan resisted Alexander the Great and Obama is far closer to that bumbler Bush as a tactician than Alexander the Great. Do the Pentagon planners know the meaning of the word hubris?  From almost all indications, they do not.  Perhaps, on a slow afternoon, this movie might be studied, for clues and errors to avoid.  But for the moment, I fear my country is like that wheezing Soviet tank, stalked by a relentless reckoning we've mistaken for terrorism while our economy collapses.Thank you, for reading this review of a fine, five star film, from a USAF veteran of the Vietnam era and author of A Tale of Two AWOLS, Dubya and I.",5,Afghanistan?

342707,AYUFQY3XG4ZBR,6302875153,"Johnny Sideburns ""21st Century Renaissance Man""","[67, 73]","The political climate at the time of this film's release in 1988 made it impossible for it to obtain the distribution it deserved; the movie itself, taking place during the first full year of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, centers around a Soviet tank crew who are commanded by a miserable officer who is a veteran of the Old School...and the Old War (his details of his exploits as a child in Stalingrad against the Nazis are both chilling and exceptionally revealing). He has no regard for the lives of the people in whose country his armies are &quot;guests&quot; (the government in Kabul at the time was well- supported by Moscow), and he has neither regard for anything he perceives as weakness among his own troops, nor time to listen to anyone who would interfere with his command of them. This leads to the action that ultimately adds the twist of &quot;Badal&quot; (Islamic term for &quot;revenge&quot;) as the tankers become lost in a box canyon and attempt to elude Mujahideen (Islamic freedom fighters) as they return to their column.&gt;I know it's an insignificant and meaningless consequence to the actions of September 11, 2001 here in the United States...but I believe this movie should be reassessed and far more appreciated. The decision to allow the Soviets to speak not in the traditional thickly-accented English that can be expected from most intrigue movies, but instead with American dialects (any of these guys could have been extras in &quot;A Bronx Tale&quot;) was inspired at the time, and it very effectively humanized an enemy that we in America had been indoctrinated to believe were &quot;an Evil Empire&quot;. And in truth, the first scene of the armored attack of an Afghan village pretty much supports this categorization...but as the movie runs its course, you start to wonder.&gt;The Afghans, in contract, speak their native tongue (with subtitles). This is an incredible feat, particularly pulled off by Steven Bauer (&quot;Manolo&quot;, from &quot;Scarface&quot;) as the young Khan who inherits his position after his elders are killed during Soviet interrogation. The Afghans religiously see their obligation to destroy the Soviets as divine will, and are thoroughly merciless in their attempts to do so. A group that begin the movie as oppressed but gallant freedom fighters slowly reveal themselves to be little short of brigands, literally (at least in the case of their women) thirsty for the blood of their invaders.&gt;Of course, today things are different. Today we as Americans are only beginning to understand the horror that the conflict in Afghanistan was (and continues to be). Today we as a country ask ourselves what we were thinking when we pledged our support to the Mujahideen that eventually begat the Taliban in an attempt to thwart an &quot;Evil Empire&quot; who, for some reason, wanted to control the most worthless patch of land on this planet.&gt;Therefore, I say with great conviction: Watch this movie...and when you find yourself wondering if it's right to feel one way or the other for one side or the other, then you find yourself understanding a little more about what war really is.",5,Things have changed a lot since 1988.,1000684800,"09 17, 2001",2001,3159,"['political', 'climate', 'time', 'film', 'release', '1988', 'made', 'impossible', 'obtain', 'distribution', 'deserved', 'movie', 'taking', 'place', 'first', 'full', 'year', 'Soviet', 'invasion', 'Afghanistan', 'centers', 'Soviet', 'tank', 'crew', 'who', 'are', 'commanded', 'miserable', 'officer', 'who', 'veteran', 'Old', 'School', 'Old', 'War', 'details', 'exploits', 'child', 'Stalingrad', 'Nazis', 'are', 'chilling', 'exceptionally', 'revealing', 'regard', 'lives', 'people', 'country', 'armies', 'are', 'quot', 'guests', 'quot', 'government', 'Kabul', 'time', 'was', 'well-', 'supported', 'Moscow', 'regard', 'anything', 'weakness', 'own', 'troops', 'time', 'listen', 'anyone', 'who', 'would', 'interfere', 'command', 'action', 'ultimately', 'twist', 'quot', 'Badal', 'quot', 'Islamic', 'term', 'quot', 'revenge', 'quot', 'tankers', 'become', 'lost', 'box', 'canyon', 'attempt', 'elude', 'Mujahideen', 'Islamic', 'freedom', 'fighters', 'return', 'column.', 'gt', 'know', 'insignificant', 'meaningless', 'consequence', 'actions', 'September', '11', '2001', 'here', 'United', 'States', 'believe', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'reassessed', 'far', 'more', 'appreciated', 'decision', 'allow', 'Soviets', 'speak', 'not', 'traditional', 'thickly-accented', 'English', 'can', 'be', 'expected', 'most', 'intrigue', 'movies', 'instead', 'American', 'dialects', 'guys', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'extras', 'quot', 'A', 'Bronx', 'Tale', 'quot', 'was', 'inspired', 'time', 'very', 'effectively', 'humanized', 'enemy', 'America', 'had', 'been', 'indoctrinated', 'believe', 'were', 'quot', 'Evil', 'Empire', 'quot', 'truth', 'first', 'scene', 'armored', 'attack', 'Afghan', 'village', 'pretty', 'much', 'supports', 'categorization', 'movie', 'course', 'start', 'wonder.', 'gt', 'Afghans', 'contract', 'speak', 'native', 'tongue', 'subtitles', 'incredible', 'feat', 'particularly', 'pulled', 'off', 'Steven', 'Bauer', 'quot', 'Manolo', 'quot', 'quot', 'Scarface', 'quot', 'young', 'Khan', 'who', 'position', 'elders', 'are', 'killed', 'Soviet', 'interrogation', 'Afghans', 'religiously', 'see', 'obligation', 'destroy', 'Soviets', 'divine', 'will', 'are', 'thoroughly', 'merciless', 'attempts', 'do', 'so', 'group', 'movie', 'oppressed', 'gallant', 'freedom', 'fighters', 'slowly', 'reveal', 'be', 'little', 'short', 'brigands', 'literally', 'least', 'case', 'women', 'thirsty', 'blood', 'invaders.', 'gt', 'course', 'today', 'things', 'are', 'different', 'Today', 'Americans', 'are', 'only', 'beginning', 'understand', 'horror', 'conflict', 'Afghanistan', 'was', 'be', 'Today', 'country', 'ask', 'what', 'were', 'thinking', 'when', 'pledged', 'support', 'Mujahideen', 'eventually', 'Taliban', 'attempt', 'thwart', 'quot', 'Evil', 'Empire', 'quot', 'who', 'reason', 'wanted', 'control', 'most', 'worthless', 'patch', 'land', 'planet.', 'gt', 'Therefore', 'say', 'great', 'conviction', 'Watch', 'movie', 'when', 'find', 'wondering', 'right', 'feel', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'one', 'side', 'other', 'then', 'find', 'understanding', 'little', 'more', 'what', 'war', 'really']",N/A

When I first saw it in the cinema I returned to see it a second time immediately after leaving the theatre. I just do not get it why it didn't have more success. May be because it is NOT an easy and stupid Chuck Norris kind of movie with one hero shooting the entire armies.Here the fight is much more realistic - to get your man you have to work for it. And human beings do not die easily - especially if they are inside a tank. For a large part of time the action of this film takes place in just one &#34;room&#34; and not very large one - indeed, there are few surroundings more claustrophobic and limited than the inside of an armoured vehicle. This is a small universe in miniature, which has a surprising number of possibilities to explore and the director just did it.And the horrible fight for survival of the Soviet crew is really something to watch - I for one always deeply hated Soviet Union and wished its defeat in Afghanistan, but in this movie I really had a problem not to start to symphatise with the four Red Army soldiers and their T-62 tank trapped in Afghan mountains.This is a TREASURE - see it and judge by yourself.",5,"""A shell out of commission becomes a mine.

I learn something new every time I see it.It wasn't until 9/11 and the decision to attack the Taliban in Afghanistan that most Americans were actually aware of what had happened in the war covered by this film  It serves the same purpose that :Behind Enemy Lines"" did for the Serbo Croatian War.  Its too bad because we would have been much more aware of the dangers inherent in the Middle East if more of us had seen this film when it was firm realized.  What we did know was that President Carter had withdrawn the United States from the Olympics because of this war and, after ten(?) years of bloodshed, it had become ""the Russians' Vietnam"".  This was not a Civil War; it was a war between the Afghan Independence Movement (Moshe Hadeen? sorry) and the Russian backed puppet government.  If the Russians hadn't been there, there wouldn't have been much of a war.  When it was over, there was a vacuum which was filled by the Taliban who gave Al Quaida a home, etc. etc, etc.  This film shows a small piece of that war in the story of the tank commander, maddened by the war, who treats his tank as an extension of himself and forces his crew to follow him.  One by one, he kills the crew as they displease him.  He doesn't like what the Muslim crew member tells him about the route they must take, and he doesn't like the fact that the man insists on doing his required prayers so he shoots him.  He doesn't like the resistance given by the college educated tank driver so he leaves him tied to a rock with a grenade under him.  The commander is a look into the psyche of a man exhausted and crazed by wars with only the desire to hurt as much as possible anyone who opposes him.  It also gives a look at what not to do when fighting those such as the Afghanistanis and perhaps the Iraqis.  The deaths and abuses which the freedom fighters brought down on the heads of the Russians and the resulting body count and body bags which were returned to Russia are said to have contributed to the downfall of the Soviet Union.  This film didn't get much distribution in 1988.  However, perhaps it is time for it to be rereleased so that we can learn its lessons.

So I was confused at the time if I should feel sorry for them (in the movie) or not.This movie takes place during the Russian Invasion of Afghanistan back in 1981.  It's a story where a platoon of Russian T-55 tanks attack a village and then upon withdrawing, one tank lags behind and therefore loses visual contact with the rest of its platoon.  They then make one wrong turn at a fork in the road and it leads to a dead end all the while being persued by Afghan Mujahadeen.  However there is somewhat of a crew mutanty where the gunner likes to drink the transmission and brake fluid and the loader is an Afghan who is a sympathizer for the Russians while the driver [Jason Patric] is sympathizing with the Afghans.  It all ends up where the driver fights alongside the Afghans and ultimately redeems himself by helping the Afghans take out the tank as it reaches the point where it made the wrong turn.And now it is so ironic that this movie along with Rambo III has greater relevance with current events.  I kind of found it ironic that I was actually rooting for the guys with the T-55 tanks this time.  (Northern Alliance)",4,"Out of fuel, become a pillbox.

The fact, forgotten by some of us who were around while this was happening, is that the spread of communism is synonymous with genocide.  The Soviet solution to a troublesome population - Kill them all.  Instant easy solution.If you have ever scratched your head and wondered why we were invloved in this fight against the USSR, this movie will answer that question.It also provides terrific insight to Afghan culture and terrain.  Accuracy throughout the movie as a whole is awesome.  All the way down to the T62 tank.  Uniforms, weapons, tactics, all pretty good!Don't watch this movie with the hope of taking any concepts and translating them to our current presence in the nation of Afghanistan.  Keep in mind, the date this is taking place is 1981!  If you were to try and say Americans fight in the same manner as Russians - tell that to my face and I'll promptly punch you in yours!  Our role in the fight against terror is VASTLY different than that of the USSR in the late '70s and 80's.People may interpret this as anti-war propoganda.  Not so.  It's an accurate reflection of the conflict between the Soviets and Afghans.  Bottom line.  Not good, not bad - just the way it was.  Here's a concept that ANYONE who has really been involved in battle understands -> War is enough of an Anti-War motivator.  The last thing REAL veterans need is a bunch of clowns who have never ""seen the elephant"" preaching crap they've never experienced.

342727,A2Q13PHEXGR48Q,6302875153,T O'Brien,"[1, 1]","Based on a play, The Beast tells a story of a war in Afghanistan in the 1980s that most people may know from a much different movie, Rambo 3.  In 1981 in Afghanistan, a Russian armored column destroys an Afghan village. One tank is left behind to ""clean things up"" and when trying to catch up to the column, becomes separated and hopelessly lost in a valley the locals call 'the valley of the jackal' with one way in and one way out.  The local Afghan rebels put their differences aside and band together to destroy this lone tank lost in the desert.  The war between Russia and Afghanistan in the 80s hasn't been dealt with much through film, but this movie sets the bar pretty high.  Characters on both sides are presented so you really get a feel of what everyone is going through along with their beliefs and what drives them, some it's greed, others faith, and other just survival.  On a simpler level, it's an exciting movie and one that kept me interested until the very end.  Little known, but a must-see movie.Leading a very capable cast, George Dzundza, maybe most well known for his part in tv's Law and Order, plays Daskal, the tank commander trying to get to safety. Daskal lies somewhere between driven soldier and insane and paranoid stopping at nothing to get his tank to safety.  In his first movie after The Lost Boys, Jason Patric plays Korverchenko, the tank driver who's gotten in trouble in the past for thinking too much and because of that, clashes with everything Daskal orders.  Dzundza and Patric's conflict is believable and really propels the story along. Steven Bauer is very good as Taj, the leader of the Afghan rebels pursuing the tank across the desert.  The rest of the tank's crew includes Stephen Baldwin as Golikov, the young soldier torn between orders and what's right, Don Harvey as Kaminski, the gunner who blindly does what he's told, and Erick Avari as Samad, the Afghan soldier navigating the tank.  Kabir Bedi also stars as Akbar, Taj's uncle who he seeks advice from.The DVD is a bit disappointing when it comes to presentation and special features.  The movie's presented in pan-n-scan, a clean one at least, but it would have been nice to see the movie and its Israeli filming locations in widescreen.  Special features include talent bios on some of the cast and trailers for three movies, but not one for The Beast.  Not a great DVD, but a good deal for the price considering how good the movie is.

342728,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,6302875153,Tommy Dooley,"[1, 1]","This is an American made film set in 1981 during the Russo-Afghan war. It starts with a stark reminder of what awaits the fallen in Afghanistan with the oft quoted final verse from Rudyard Kipling's `The Young British Soldier';""When you're wounded and left on Afghanistan's plains,And the women come out to cut up what remains,Jest roll to your rifle and blow out your brainsAn' go to your Gawd like a soldier.""That was of course written for the British Second War in that country. This then sets us up for what is going to be pretty brutal. The opening sequences are centred on a small village that is attacked and razed ruthlessly by a detachment of `Russian' tanks. They are callous and depart after reeking havoc. In the aftermath we meet the surviving Afghans and they discover that one of the tanks has lost the main column and has strayed into a nearby valley. This valley is a dead end and will make the tank easy prey.The tank is the proverbial `beast', but it could also refer to the tank commander who is a caricature of evil, bordering on the psychotic. The tensions that are thrown up under his command are constant and escalating. He is driven by hate and rules with an iron will.The cinematography is excellent and the landscape, bleak but strangely beautiful, the Afghans do speak Pashto and the sub titles are very good.The Afghans have their riffs too, and they are also played out, not least the problem of keeping their women out of the fighting. There is a lot of tension, and action throughout, this film races along whilst building momentum through out and I really did enjoy it. The one point that got me was the fact that the `Russians' are clearly all American with their own accents. We know the Americans can do accents, at least since `Star Trek', so even some cod Rusky accents would have helped the believability, but they can be forgiven for that as what we are left with is actually a very good example of how to make a good war film, which deals with more than just the fighting. One of the lines that struck me in this was when one of the soldiers says 'You always have a choice!' With that in mind I would advise choosing to see this rather good film.",4,'We Are a Flea in the Tail of a Bear!',1305763200,"05 19, 2011",2011,2187,"['American', 'made', 'film', 'set', '1981', 'Russo-Afghan', 'war', 'stark', 'reminder', 'what', 'fallen', 'Afghanistan', 'oft', 'quoted', 'final', 'verse', 'Rudyard', 'Kipling', 'Young', 'British', 'Soldier', 'When', ""'re"", 'wounded', 'left', 'Afghanistan', 'plains', 'women', 'come', 'cut', 'up', 'what', 'Jest', 'roll', 'rifle', 'blow', 'out', 'brainsAn', 'go', 'Gawd', 'soldier', 'was', 'course', 'written', 'British', 'Second', 'War', 'country', 'then', 'up', 'what', 'going', 'be', 'pretty', 'brutal', 'opening', 'sequences', 'are', 'centred', 'small', 'village', 'attacked', 'razed', 'ruthlessly', 'detachment', 'Russian', 'tanks', 'are', 'callous', 'depart', 'reeking', 'havoc', 'aftermath', 'meet', 'surviving', 'Afghans', 'discover', 'one', 'tanks', 'lost', 'main', 'column', 'strayed', 'nearby', 'valley', 'valley', 'dead', 'end', 'will', 'make', 'tank', 'easy', 'prey.The', 'tank', 'proverbial', 'beast', 'could', 'also', 'refer', 'tank', 'commander', 'who', 'caricature', 'evil', 'bordering', 'psychotic', 'tensions', 'are', 'thrown', 'up', 'command', 'are', 'constant', 'escalating', 'driven', 'hate', 'rules', 'iron', 'will.The', 'cinematography', 'excellent', 'landscape', 'bleak', 'strangely', 'beautiful', 'Afghans', 'do', 'speak', 'Pashto', 'sub', 'titles', 'are', 'very', 'good.The', 'Afghans', 'have', 'riffs', 'too', 'are', 'also', 'played', 'out', 'not', 'least', 'problem', 'keeping', 'women', 'fighting', 'lot', 'tension', 'action', 'film', 'along', 'whilst', 'building', 'momentum', 'really', 'did', 'enjoy', 'one', 'point', 'got', 'was', 'fact', 'Russians', 'are', 'clearly', 'American', 'own', 'accents', 'know', 'Americans', 'can', 'do', 'accents', 'least', 'Star', 'Trek', 'even', 'cod', 'Rusky', 'accents', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'believability', 'can', 'be', 'forgiven', 'what', 'are', 'left', 'actually', 'very', 'good', 'example', 'how', 'make', 'good', 'war', 'film', 'more', 'just', 'fighting', 'One', 'lines', 'struck', 'was', 'when', 'one', 'soldiers', ""'You"", 'always', 'have', 'choice', 'mind', 'would', 'advise', 'choosing', 'see', 'rather', 'good', 'film']",N/A
