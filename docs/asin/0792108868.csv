Carson City has a horse-drawn trolley. &#8220;Queen Victoria is dead, Long Live the King&#8221; says the newspaper. John Books sees a doctor about his medical condition. &#8220;What&#8217;s ailing you?&#8221; Its an advanced cancer, very little can be done for it except pain relief. Books finds a room at a boarding house, and a stable for his horse. He gives his name as &#8220;William Hickok&#8221; from Abilene. Mrs. Rogers finds out his true name and calls the Marshal. Books explains why he can&#8217;t leave town and asks for privacy. Gillom talks to him, then Books confides to Mrs. Rogers. A newspaper publisher interviews him about his past; he is ordered out the door. &#8220;A savage thing to do?&#8221; The doctor tells Books about the terminal stage. Books wants to see the area from a horse and buggy. A man deals cards in the saloon, then orders another man out. [Note the use of a shoe.] Will there be trouble?Books and Mrs. Rogers ride through town and meet Mr. Sweeney. At night men attack Books in his room; they failed. Gillom is impressed by this, their house will be famous. Other boarders leave due to the notoriety. Marshal Thibodeau speaks candidly to Books. Bookds sells his horse and saddle for cash. Gillom asks him for a shooting lesson. Will he go against Pulford? Books explains the most important quality in a gunfight to Gillom. Later he meets an old girlfriend. &#8220;We all have our time.&#8221; She suggests marriage, she talks about writing a book. &#8220;I loved you once.&#8221; Now Books eats in the kitchen as there are no other boarders. Will he go to church on Sunday? The undertaker greets Books. &#8220;The early bird gets the worm.&#8221; Books dictates the deal to Beckham. Can the barber profit from a haircut? Mrs. Rogers surmises Books plans to do something, and he asks for favor. &#8220;I promise.&#8221; Gillom reports to Books. Sweeney is mean and hates Books. Gillom is rewarded for his tasks.Books prepares to meet those three men in a saloon. Its his birthday today. &#8220;Goodbye Mrs. Rogers.&#8221; It&#8217;s a beautiful day. The Marshal brings Cobb to that saloon. Then Sweeney arrives. &#8220;Try your luck?&#8221; Books arrives at the Metropole and orders &#8220;the best in the house&#8221;. Then there are shots fired. &#8220;That was for Albert.&#8221; Then it is very quiet. There is an unexpected shooting. &#8220;Lookout!&#8221; [A surprise?] Wasn&#8217;t this just over-dramatic? Gillom returns home while others run to the Metropole.This was filmed partly in Carson City, Nevada. It was John Wayne&#8217;s last movie before he died of cancer. Cigarette smoking caused him to lose a lung in the early 1960s, but he continued working as an actor. This movie seems to have less action than Wayne&#8217;s earlier movies, his health explained that. Do many of these scenes seem too clean and perfect for a frontier town in a dusty country? It wasn&#8217;t much of a story, just about personal revenge or conflict. Did Gillom&#8217;s action seem to contradict what went on earlier? Was this &#8220;politically correct&#8221; based on the wishes of the producer?

The storyline is somewhat simple - a dying infamous gunfighter is finally facing fear, but not at the hands of another gunman, rather at a painful and debilitating illness. James Stewart adds grace to the aging town doctor who tells Wayne &quot;I would not die a death like I described, if I were brave like you&quot;, lending to a story of one final showdown. Some interesting cameos add to the plot, and an early performance from Ron Howard as an impressionable teenager blend well. I think what sets this apart from many Wayne movies, is his versatility - often rebuked for writing his own character over other roles, here he is both believable and accomplished.

His ""All American"" stance was just another Hollywood lie.

I'm not rating this 5 stars because I have a special fondness for Westerns, because I don't.  I'm rating it 5 stars because it's one of the most poignant films ever made, absolutely appropriate that the Duke's final film would be about a dying gunslinger's last act to save a young wannabe from following in his sad, lonely, misunderstood footsteps.The plot of the film, its phenomenal cast, etc., can be easily found in other reviews on this page, so I won't go over that again.  Let me just say that this bit of historical knowledge---John Wayne dying of cancer portraying J.B. Books dying of cancer---elevates ""The Shootist"" from a bittersweet Western character study to a very, very special piece of movie history.  In one of his finest performances, the Duke subtly displays the pathos of a man forced to be a loner who now is forced to rely on the kindness of people who owe him no kindness; he can now only repay them by effectively ending one young man's quest to imitate his gunfighter hero.  Wayne's performance is perfect; as an actor would say, the best acting is when it doesn't feel like acting.  Knowing what he was going through makes the story all the more real.The film is not up to the level of ""High Noon"" or ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly,"" IMO the two greatest Western films ever made.

It wasn't until I was in my 20's that I began to watch and appreciate Wayne's movies and now I genuinely love his legacy and many of his films. This is Duke's last film and truly one of his best. His acting prowess is shown to its best advantage here. There is no doubt that Wayne's acting talent deepened with age and was always best expressed when he was surrounded by other quality actors.As most people know, Wayne was already diagnosed with cancer as he made this film. There are few more poignant scenes in any movie than when Wayne's character describes the pains in his back to physician Jimmy Stewart, and Stewart returns with his verdict: &quot;You have a cancer.&quot; The viewer knows that John Wayne really *did* have cancer and would die from it in a year. Only those who loathe Wayne could watch this scene and not have tears swimming in their eyes.There are, of course, better John Wayne movies, but few that pack the emotional wallop of this one. All of his scenes with Lauren Bacall are deftly made and touching. Their screen chemistry is gentle and charming. His scenes with Ron Howard are less pleasing, since Howard's acting talents were marginal, at best.I recommend this movie to those who still hate John Wayne or regard him as a lousy actor.

123923,AUHG8KSHI529U,0792108868,Craig Matteson,"[5, 5]","This is one of my favorite movies.  I think it is one of the best of the films that deal with the death of the Old West and the transition to smaller and unheroic modern times.  J B Books is a valedictory character on several levels.  For those of us who know Wayne's biography, we know this was his last film and appreciate what a fine job he did with the role.  It is also, in its way, a valedictory to the kind of Western that Wayne made with a clear hero and bad guys.Yes, you can claim that Books, who has killed dozens upon dozens of men, was a ""bad guy"".  However, that is also another measure of its valedictory nature.  The movie shows us how men died at the end of Books' gun.  And Books himself claims that he ended up killing men who deserved it and largely in self-defense because he was living in the wild country.  The civilized types who have never been in the boots in which Books walked see all killing as an example of bad character and hire others to kill on their behalf.  So, it is also the valedictory of courage and the transition to the safety seeking city dweller.  You know: us.Towards the beginning of the film, JB Books seeks out Dr. Hostetler (a fine small role for Jimmy Stewart) to confirm a terrible diagnosis he had gotten elsewhere.  Books hears that he is going to die quite soon and in a painful and awful way.  He gets a bottle of laudanum from the Doc and asks if it isn't habit forming and the Doc confirms that it is.  The lack of the ""but"" is one of the many nice moments in the film.  We are taught by this more obvious exchange to look more closely for all that is not being said in a surprisingly subtle Waynestern. (Actually, most were more subtle than the caricature his detractors have scribbled for us.)The Doc points him to the Widow Rogers (magnificently played by Lauren Bacall) where he can rent a room.  Books is quite clear in his demands and so private he won't even share his name.  The widow is instantly put on guard by the guns and her new boarder's secretiveness.  She also has a near adult son named Gillom (Ron Howard in one of his very best roles).  Gillom takes an instant dislike to the guest because he doesn't like the way he is being bossed around and sets out to find who this big old man is.  When he finds out it is J B Books, the cover is blown and the whole town disregards his desire for privacy.I don't want to spoil all the delights of the story, but it is fascinating how people want to condemn Books, but still use him to enhance their own lives.  Sheree North as Books' past love, Serepta has one of the more heartbreaking scenes.  Harry Morgan has a great turn as Marshall Walter Thibido (the name reveals his character).  And the three men who will finally face Books are Bill Kinney as Jay Cobb, Hugh O'Brian and the faro dealer Jack Pulford and the glorious Richard Boone as Mike Sweeny.  Some have criticized this final challenge as contrived.  In a way, it is because it is required in these kinds of stories.  But each of the three does have a real motivation.  Sweeny hate Books for killing his brother, Pulford has a reputation to protect, and Cobb wants nothing to do with it but is put into the fight by Thibido because he has been such a big mouth and bully to everyone else.I also enjoyed Scatman Crothers as the liveryman Moses Brown.  He has an important role in showing us Gillom's development and struggle.  This film has a very important sub-plot about Gillom's transition from boy to man and deciding what kind of man he will be.  In the beginning he is full of boyish energy and willing to take the attention of any man who will pay attention to him.  Once he becomes attached to Books he is attracted to the glory of his reputation, but the reality of Books puts him in a conflicted state of mind.  And the choices he makes outside the saloon during the final conflict and inside at the end of it reveal how far Books has come.  Gillom's final walk home, at first towards his mother makes us think he is going to her for comfort, but he turns and then she follows him.  His journey to manhood is completed in the furnace of sorrow and turning away from rage at the last.A terrific movie.  I hope you will see it.Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MI",5,One of my favorite films and I think one of Wayne's very best,1201219200,"01 25, 2008",2008,4254,"['one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'think', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'deal', 'death', 'Old', 'West', 'transition', 'smaller', 'unheroic', 'modern', 'times', 'J', 'B', 'Books', 'valedictory', 'character', 'several', 'levels', 'who', 'know', 'Wayne', 'biography', 'know', 'was', 'last', 'film', 'appreciate', 'what', 'fine', 'job', 'did', 'role', 'also', 'way', 'valedictory', 'kind', 'Western', 'Wayne', 'made', 'clear', 'hero', 'bad', 'guys.Yes', 'can', 'claim', 'Books', 'who', 'killed', 'dozens', 'dozens', 'men', 'was', 'bad', 'guy', 'However', 'also', 'measure', 'valedictory', 'nature', 'movie', 'how', 'men', 'died', 'end', 'Books', 'gun', 'Books', 'ended', 'up', 'killing', 'men', 'who', 'deserved', 'largely', 'self-defense', 'was', 'living', 'wild', 'country', 'civilized', 'types', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'boots', 'Books', 'walked', 'see', 'killing', 'example', 'bad', 'character', 'hire', 'others', 'kill', 'behalf', 'So', 'also', 'valedictory', 'courage', 'transition', 'safety', 'seeking', 'city', 'dweller', 'know', 'us.Towards', 'beginning', 'film', 'JB', 'Books', 'out', 'Dr.', 'Hostetler', 'fine', 'small', 'role', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'confirm', 'terrible', 'diagnosis', 'had', 'gotten', 'elsewhere', 'Books', 'going', 'die', 'quite', 'soon', 'painful', 'awful', 'way', 'bottle', 'laudanum', 'Doc', ""n't"", 'habit', 'forming', 'Doc', 'lack', 'one', 'many', 'nice', 'moments', 'film', 'are', 'taught', 'more', 'obvious', 'exchange', 'look', 'more', 'closely', 'not', 'being', 'said', 'surprisingly', 'subtle', 'Waynestern', 'Actually', 'most', 'were', 'more', 'subtle', 'caricature', 'detractors', 'have', 'scribbled', 'Doc', 'points', 'Widow', 'Rogers', 'magnificently', 'played', 'Lauren', 'Bacall', 'where', 'can', 'rent', 'room', 'Books', 'quite', 'clear', 'demands', 'so', 'private', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'share', 'name', 'widow', 'instantly', 'put', 'guard', 'guns', 'new', 'boarder', 'secretiveness', 'also', 'near', 'adult', 'son', 'named', 'Gillom', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'roles', 'Gillom', 'instant', 'dislike', 'guest', ""n't"", 'like', 'way', 'being', 'bossed', 'out', 'find', 'who', 'big', 'old', 'man', 'When', 'J', 'B', 'Books', 'cover', 'blown', 'whole', 'town', 'disregards', 'desire', 'privacy.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'delights', 'story', 'fascinating', 'how', 'people', 'want', 'condemn', 'Books', 'still', 'use', 'enhance', 'own', 'lives', 'Sheree', 'North', 'Books', 'past', 'love', 'Serepta', 'one', 'more', 'heartbreaking', 'scenes', 'Harry', 'Morgan', 'great', 'turn', 'Marshall', 'Walter', 'Thibido', 'name', 'character', 'three', 'men', 'who', 'will', 'finally', 'face', 'Books', 'are', 'Bill', 'Kinney', 'Jay', 'Cobb', 'Hugh', ""O'Brian"", 'faro', 'dealer', 'Jack', 'Pulford', 'glorious', 'Richard', 'Boone', 'Mike', 'Sweeny', 'have', 'criticized', 'final', 'challenge', 'contrived', 'way', 'required', 'kinds', 'stories', 'three', 'have', 'real', 'motivation', 'Sweeny', 'hate', 'Books', 'killing', 'brother', 'Pulford', 'reputation', 'protect', 'Cobb', 'nothing', 'do', 'put', 'fight', 'Thibido', 'been', 'big', 'mouth', 'bully', 'everyone', 'else.I', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'Scatman', 'Crothers', 'liveryman', 'Moses', 'Brown', 'important', 'role', 'showing', 'Gillom', 'development', 'struggle', 'film', 'very', 'important', 'sub-plot', 'Gillom', 'transition', 'boy', 'man', 'deciding', 'what', 'kind', 'man', 'will', 'be', 'beginning', 'full', 'boyish', 'energy', 'willing', 'take', 'attention', 'man', 'who', 'will', 'pay', 'attention', 'Once', 'attached', 'Books', 'attracted', 'glory', 'reputation', 'reality', 'Books', 'conflicted', 'state', 'mind', 'choices', 'saloon', 'final', 'conflict', 'inside', 'end', 'reveal', 'how', 'far', 'Books', 'come', 'Gillom', 'final', 'walk', 'home', 'first', 'towards', 'mother', 'think', 'going', 'comfort', 'then', 'journey', 'manhood', 'completed', 'furnace', 'sorrow', 'turning', 'away', 'rage', 'last.A', 'terrific', 'movie', 'hope', 'will', 'see', 'it.Reviewed', 'Craig', 'Matteson', 'Ann', 'Arbor', 'MI']",N/A

It is not so much the story of a gunslinger, but the story of dying with dignity. John Wayne's character, J.B.Books has a rich history hinted at in the film. Although we barely see his horse, we know that they have been through much together, that it's a fine horse, and that the horse may just be his closest friend. Our knowledge of westerns tells us so much of the back story and fills in so much of the character detail without our having to be told, that the film has time to concentrate on its main story, the developing relationship between Books and his landlady (probably the most elegant old lady in cinema, Lauren Bacall), and her son, played by a young Ron Howard. The film is pleasantly short, and well-paced throughout its 90 minute length. The story is split up into a number of days, each of which is clearly announced on the screen, a good example to the many films where the passage of time is not clear.

Playing an aging gunslinger who suddenly has to come to grips with his own mortality, Wayne ironically would face the same existential issues in his own life soon after the film's release.  What I so enjoyed about THE SHOOTIST is the fact Wayne's character, J.B. Books, is not in the typical Wayne-vein (brash, violent, angry, often overbearing, belligerent, etc.); rather, Wayne wonderfully plays a thoughtful, introspective, compassionate man who wishes to merely spend his final days in peace.  Unfortunately, his bloody past will not allow him to do so.It was also great to see so many iconic actors make appearances in this film.  John Carradine.  Richard Boone.  Scatman Crothers.  Hugh O'Brian.  The fantastic James Stewart (the old saw bones who gives the Duke the bad news).  And a very emaciated Lauren Bacall playing the stern, yet fair, proprietor of the boarding house where Books is staying.  A gushy Ron Howard plays an impressionable teen whom Wayne mentors, and Harry Morgan just seems so wrong as the bad apple sheriff of Carson City, Nevada.  Augmented by the cast, Wayne moves through this film with a quiet, steady dignity; the pain in his eyes, for all we know, may have been very much for real.  The shoot-'em-up scene that ushers in the film's climax is just silly (but oh so essential for a Wayne Western), but wasn't goofy enough to take away from my enjoyment of THE SHOOTIST.  What a grand way for the Duke to ride off into the sunset.--D.

The cast is replete with heroes from TV and movie westerns, and features great performances by Jimmy Stewart as Doc Hostetler, Lauren Bacall as the widow Rogers, the Duke's would-be love interest, and Ron Howard as Gillam Rogers, the widow's eager teenage son who is coming into manhood.Wayne plays John Bernard Books, an infamous gunfighter and frontiersman who defines the persona of the rugged Westerner. He comes to Carson City, Nevada to seek out the diagnosis of the only doctor he's ever trusted, Doc Hostetler. The two Hollywood legends play out a classic scene of humor, respect, and finality between two old friends. His worst fears confirmed, Books seeks out a place to play out his final act.He takes a room at the widow Roger's boarding house, and a night doesn't go by before Book's condition becomes the talk of the town, and killers try to dispatch him in the middle of the night. Appalled and frightened by Book's coarse manner and infamous reputation, Bacall's character calls upon Henry Morgan as the town's chatty sheriff Tibodeaux, to throw the Duke out into the street, before all of her boarders move out. And this is where the unique performance by Wayne and the story begins to take shape.Wayne becomes a surrogate father to Gillam and tries to impart his wisdom and guidance on the impressionable young man. And Book's plan to meet his fate begins to unfold. The movie includes classic villian portrayals by Richard Boone, Bill Kenney, and Edmund O'Brien. There are also terrific cameos by John Carradine as the undertaker and Sheree North as Book's long lost love.The beauty of ""The Shootist"" is that it relies entirely on the strength of the actor's performances and the plot turns of the story. It is a beautifully poignant tribute to the American Western that examines the end of the West as these characters have lived it. It hints at a country ready to trade in the untamed frontier for the progressive evolution of the country as it stands poised to enter the 20th Century.Books and the other characters in ""The Shootist"" provide one last great hurrah to celebrate what made the taming of the American West such a profound and enduring tradition in American film making.

123936,A84Z6XUMGRMJ1,0792108868,Duane Thomas,"[6, 8]","This is the story of the last eight days in the life of John Bernard Books (John Wayne), a legendary gunfighter who pulls into Carson City, Nevada on January 22, 1901. Books is dying of inoperable prostate cancer. Knowing that all he has to look forward to in the few weeks left him is an undiginfied and agonizing death as his disease progressively worsens, and unwilling to go out that way, Books orchestrates one last glorious gunfight, himself versus the only three men in town who just might be able to kill him.The Shootist has the cast from Hell: John Wayne, Jimmy Stewart, Lauren Bacall, Ron Howard, Harry Morgan, John Carradine, Hugh O'Brian, Richard Boone, Scatman Crothers, all in the same movie. Made on a shoestring budget of eight million (not a lot of money for a major Hollywood production even in mid-Seventies dollars) the only way The Shootist could afford such a cast was that everyone involved realized this would probably be Wayne's last picture, and wanted to be involved. Hugh O'Brian volunteered to play his part for free.The only ""extras"" on the DVD are the original trailer which is mediocre and a ""Making Of"" feature that's absolutely excellent. In the latter it's revealed the filmmakers changed the ending of the movie from the book on which it was based. In the novel, J.B. Books is killed at the end by young Gillom Rogers (Ron Howard) after surviving the final gun battle. But the powers that were felt it would be awfully hard to have audiences like the Howard character after that. In hindsight they realize their decision weakened the movie. And they're right. That would have been the perfect ending to The Shootist, the ultimate act of love from Gillom to Books, to be the one who ended his pain when no one else could. The way the movie does end is great - The Shootist is fully deserving of its five stars - but it could have been even better.While it would be difficult to make a case against either Once Upon a Time In the West, Red River, or The Outlaw Josey Wales being the best Western ever made, The Shootist is one of the very few movies even worthy to be mentioned in their class. It adds an immense amount of poignancy to Wayne's portrayal of J.B. Books, a strong man in the final stages of terminal cancer, to know the actor was in exactly the same situation at the time. This is arguably Wayne's finest acting job, understated and powerful. While some actors are great for a time, then degenerate into crap roles to finish out their careers (Basil Rathbone's last movie was Hillbillys from Outer Space, if you can believe it), John Wayne was a class act til the very end.

Erdelac,"[11, 13]","As surely as THE SEARCHERS and STAGECOACH are required for anyone wanting to see John Wayne in his prime, THE SHOOTIST is essential not only as latter-day Duke, but as the curtain call of the western.  While the Academy recognized the Duke for his over the top portrayal of Rooster Cogburn in 69's wonderful TRUE GRIT, it was in this picture which I believe the man gave his most heartfelt performance.The summary of this movie can be read elsewhere.  The importance of this film is undeniable, not only in the context of John Wayne's final role, but in a way, as the swan song of the western itself.  Surely there have been flashes of brilliance since, but I really think THE SHOOTIST sounded a kind of death toll for the American Western.  Up until this point the genre was a viable money maker.  Crowds still lined up to see the latest Duke offering, or to watch Paul Newman saunter in high heeled boots.  But around the time of this film some elusive quality was lost.  It seemed the closing of the west or the end of the west was the dominant theme in Westerns of the sixties.  RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY saw the end of Randolph Scott, LITTLE BIG MAN saw the end of the typical cowboys vs. Indians thread - even Leone was saying his goodbyes in ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST.  That's not to say that the western died with John Wayne - but his death was certainly a kind of manifestation of the waning days of the genre that made him great.  THE SHOOTIST definetly dealt a mortal blow.  Even through the eighties when SILVERADO and Eastwood's OUTLAW JOSEY WALES (and later TOMBSTONE in the 90s) propped the Western up one final time, it was always a hollow, rickety echo of its past glories.  Then in UNFORGIVEN, when Will Munny fired the bullet that killed Little Bill, he was really putting down this grand old pony, the Western.But THE SHOOTIST was the great end.  The blaze of glory.  In JB Books' final moments we were seeing the end of an era.  Of course, everything is cyclic, so we can hope that there will be a place for this perennial and distinctly American art form once again...someday.But about THE SHOOTIST - fantastic.  Great opening montage of classic Duke films (can you name them? - HONDO's in there, my personal favorite) John Wayne gives a hearty goodbye handshake to his own larger than life persona in a realistic, heartbreaking role.  Seeing Books slip in the bathtub is like seeing your Dad in his late hours...indeed, there is an underlying theme of fatherhood in this movie, particularly in the relationship between Wayne's and Howard's character.  Maybe Siegel was conscious of the importance of this movie to Wayne and the Western genre as a whole.  Maybe in the final act, when Gillam Rogers makes his decision about pursuing a life of bloodshed and Books gives a fatherly nod of approval, in that simple, silent gesture he was saying - `Now that you've seen all this, have you got it?  Have you learned?'Something modern filmmakers who have tried their hand at the Western just don't get is that those of us who hold it dear to our hearts don't go solely for the pistol play and the bloodshed and the high action...Westerns are NOT brainless action movies. They are morality plays which speak to the deepest and highest ideals of our collective American manhood - they show us what we are and what we ought to be.  Gary Cooper in HIGH NOON.  He could hit the road with his wife and let Frank Miller have the town, but because he is American and this is a Western, we know as well as he does that he cannot.  Sgt. Rutledge CAN'T connive or even argue his way out of the charge of rape, no matter what it means to himself and his people - he can only stand tall and state the truth he knows.  Ethan Edwards CAN'T let Lucy stay alive in the hands of the Comanches.  Butch and Sundance CAN'T be brought in alive.  And JB Books CAN'T just slip away - he knows his end must come in blood and thunder.  Hollywood today leaves the Western alone because they can't figure out a way to tweak it and make it edgy.  The simple fact is, you don't tweak the Western.  We love westerns because they ARE old and familiar, and we know what to expect.  They are as welcoming as the feel of an old boot, or a broken in hat.  THE SHOOTIST is the archetype.  If you want to understand the Western, you've got to see THE SHOOTIST.",5,Requiem,1050364800,"04 15, 2003",2003,4337,"['As', 'surely', 'THE', 'SEARCHERS', 'STAGECOACH', 'are', 'required', 'anyone', 'wanting', 'see', 'John', 'Wayne', 'prime', 'THE', 'SHOOTIST', 'essential', 'not', 'only', 'latter-day', 'Duke', 'curtain', 'call', 'western', 'Academy', 'recognized', 'Duke', 'top', 'portrayal', 'Rooster', 'Cogburn', '69', 'wonderful', 'TRUE', 'GRIT', 'was', 'picture', 'believe', 'man', 'gave', 'most', 'heartfelt', 'performance.The', 'summary', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'read', 'elsewhere', 'importance', 'film', 'undeniable', 'not', 'only', 'context', 'John', 'Wayne', 'final', 'role', 'way', 'swan', 'song', 'western', 'Surely', 'have', 'been', 'flashes', 'brilliance', 'really', 'think', 'THE', 'SHOOTIST', 'sounded', 'kind', 'death', 'toll', 'American', 'Western', 'Up', 'point', 'genre', 'was', 'viable', 'money', 'maker', 'Crowds', 'still', 'lined', 'up', 'see', 'latest', 'Duke', 'offering', 'watch', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'saunter', 'high', 'heeled', 'boots', 'time', 'film', 'elusive', 'quality', 'was', 'lost', 'seemed', 'closing', 'west', 'end', 'west', 'was', 'dominant', 'theme', 'Westerns', 'sixties', 'RIDE', 'THE', 'HIGH', 'COUNTRY', 'saw', 'end', 'Randolph', 'Scott', 'LITTLE', 'BIG', 'MAN', 'saw', 'end', 'typical', 'cowboys', 'vs.', 'Indians', 'thread', 'even', 'Leone', 'was', 'saying', 'goodbyes', 'ONCE', 'A', 'TIME', 'IN', 'THE', 'WEST', 'not', 'say', 'western', 'died', 'John', 'Wayne', 'death', 'was', 'certainly', 'kind', 'manifestation', 'waning', 'days', 'genre', 'made', 'great', 'SHOOTIST', 'definetly', 'dealt', 'mortal', 'blow', 'Even', 'eighties', 'when', 'SILVERADO', 'Eastwood', 'OUTLAW', 'JOSEY', 'WALES', 'later', 'TOMBSTONE', '90s', 'propped', 'Western', 'up', 'one', 'final', 'time', 'was', 'always', 'hollow', 'rickety', 'echo', 'past', 'glories', 'Then', 'UNFORGIVEN', 'when', 'Will', 'Munny', 'fired', 'bullet', 'killed', 'Little', 'Bill', 'was', 'really', 'putting', 'down', 'grand', 'old', 'pony', 'Western.But', 'THE', 'SHOOTIST', 'was', 'great', 'end', 'blaze', 'glory', 'JB', 'Books', 'final', 'moments', 'were', 'seeing', 'end', 'era', 'course', 'everything', 'cyclic', 'can', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'place', 'perennial', 'distinctly', 'American', 'art', 'form', 'once', 'again', 'someday.But', 'THE', 'SHOOTIST', 'fantastic', 'Great', 'opening', 'montage', 'classic', 'Duke', 'films', 'can', 'name', 'HONDO', 'there', 'personal', 'favorite', 'John', 'Wayne', 'hearty', 'goodbye', 'handshake', 'own', 'larger', 'life', 'persona', 'realistic', 'heartbreaking', 'role', 'Seeing', 'Books', 'slip', 'bathtub', 'seeing', 'Dad', 'late', 'hours', 'indeed', 'underlying', 'theme', 'fatherhood', 'movie', 'particularly', 'relationship', 'Wayne', 'Howard', 'character', 'Maybe', 'Siegel', 'was', 'conscious', 'importance', 'movie', 'Wayne', 'Western', 'genre', 'whole', 'Maybe', 'final', 'act', 'when', 'Gillam', 'Rogers', 'decision', 'pursuing', 'life', 'bloodshed', 'Books', 'fatherly', 'nod', 'approval', 'simple', 'silent', 'gesture', 'was', 'saying', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'have', 'got', 'Have', 'learned', ""'Something"", 'modern', 'filmmakers', 'who', 'have', 'tried', 'hand', 'Western', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'who', 'hold', 'dear', 'hearts', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'solely', 'pistol', 'play', 'bloodshed', 'high', 'action', 'Westerns', 'are', 'NOT', 'brainless', 'action', 'movies', 'are', 'morality', 'plays', 'speak', 'deepest', 'highest', 'ideals', 'collective', 'American', 'manhood', 'show', 'what', 'are', 'what', 'ought', 'be', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'HIGH', 'NOON', 'could', 'hit', 'road', 'wife', 'let', 'Frank', 'Miller', 'have', 'town', 'American', 'Western', 'know', 'as', 'well', 'can', 'not', 'Sgt', 'Rutledge', 'CA', ""N'T"", 'connive', 'even', 'argue', 'way', 'charge', 'rape', 'matter', 'what', 'people', 'can', 'only', 'stand', 'tall', 'state', 'truth', 'Ethan', 'Edwards', 'CA', ""N'T"", 'let', 'Lucy', 'stay', 'alive', 'hands', 'Comanches', 'Butch', 'Sundance', 'CA', ""N'T"", 'be', 'brought', 'alive', 'JB', 'Books', 'CA', ""N'T"", 'just', 'slip', 'away', 'end', 'must', 'come', 'blood', 'thunder', 'Hollywood', 'today', 'Western', 'alone', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'way', 'tweak', 'make', 'edgy', 'simple', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'tweak', 'Western', 'love', 'westerns', 'ARE', 'old', 'familiar', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'are', 'as', 'welcoming', 'feel', 'old', 'boot', 'broken', 'hat', 'SHOOTIST', 'archetype', 'want', 'understand', 'Western', ""'ve"", 'got', 'see', 'SHOOTIST']",N/A
123939,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,0792108868,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[4, 4]","Oh, John Wayne's last film. Year is 1976. It doesn't show.This is an all-time classic Western and I defy anyone to name anything remotely like it.John Bernard Books (Wayne) is an elderly gunslinger dying of cancer. He boards at Old Widow Rogers' (Bacall) boarding house, waiting for the End. Since the character, like most of Wayne's characters, is based on Wyatt Earp, expect some slam-bang adventures even for a dying old man. This movie is a hit eighteen times over!The turn-of-the-century setting is magnificent, though to modern eyes it is a bit movie-studio-tourist-attraction. To my then-youthful eyes it was a marvel, and few films remind me of this early marvel. There is Oscar-worthy acting and in spite of a predictable storyline, it is fun and compelling.Widow Rogers' rebellious teen son Gillom (a hilariously cute young Ron Howard) learns a few pointers from Books, when he isn't harassing him. The obnoxious Sheriff Thibbido (Harry Morgan, whose character's name is always misspelled considering he spells it for us in the movie) is a bit of thorn in Books' side, as are many others. And it is this that drives the film beautifully.I was also enchanted seeing Richard Boone (Sweeny the mean-ass former outlaw) and the incomparable John Carradine (undertaker trying to swindle Books on his funeral arrangements)-- also, if I am not mistaken, in their final roles here. Jimmy Stewart, though not his final role, is pretty close to the end also, and acts wonderfully here as Books' old pal the doctor. It is he, ironically, who confirms the diagnosis of Books' cancer.There is rarely mention of the cameo Scatman Cruthers offers here, charming and smooth as silk. How I miss that fella too. And that is ultimately what we have: a nostalgiafest of epic proportions. Everybody in this film is dead now except Bacall and of course fancy-pants director Ron Howard.

Grey ""the Wizard""","[11, 22]","This is from the heart....I grew up with a generation of kids who had never seen all the ""B"" westerns that Mr. Wayne made when he was a strapping young man who was hired because he COULD do all those things you couldn't afford to pay stunt men to do if you were a small studio....My generation never saw him REALLY ride horses, jump on bad men, have 3 minute fist fights, rescue run away stages and all the other daring things he could do that regular actors just couldn't do.....my generation saw him after he was a huge national treasure, an icon and so valuable he had to let others do the stunt work: they thought he was ""just a star""...a really big star, but just a star.....not a bigger than life, man's man who could do everything he did in films, for real.....John Wayne was everything we in America cherished, before the liberals began to fear personal responsibilty and ""self esteem"" problems that allow a kid to think 2+2=5 so his feelings aren't hurt, even thought he learns nothing....John Wayne and the characters he played had all the virtues that make America the great land is was to become.....(sometimes I look at what we are today and I worry for our future, but my prayers are that the Good Lord will watch over this great nation and prevent it from giving away services to illegal aliens and other such wrong things, and return us to the age of hard work, smaller government hand outs and right and wrong......)When I saw this film I knew it was Mr. Wayne's last, it was a feeling that came over me: I knew this was the last time we'd ever see him on film, a way of saying good bye to his fans around the world and kind of explaining what was happening to him at the same time......you could see it in Jimmy Stewart's eyes....Jimmy knew.....The good news is there are some new heroes in America today, not the least is the fine creator of Amazon.com, who faced a new frontier and earned the success he deserves from his efforts.......My point is this: we need Mr. Wayne more today than we have in a long time, (especially after the clinton era) and this good film shows some insight into a great man, not just a great actor.This film is worth owning because it was Mr. Wayne's last, and with ""Liberty Valance"" for the opening, this is the perfect ending to a double feature that could teach a lot of Americans just what actually being an American means...But then I guess just about any movie he was ever in could do that...right pilgrim?",5,This is not your standard movie review....,1053907200,"05 26,

Wayne had organized a final shootout with three opponents as a means to die (He had a severe and terminal cancer). One was a con, one an ex con and one a marksman who wouldn't mind having the death of this shootist on his shingle. However, Wayne out dueled the three, but at the end he was killed by the bartender, who shot him in the back.

123947,A2R3INLUR13KVQ,0792108868,"Gert Marincowitz ""Critic""","[5, 12]","In 1976, John Wayne appeared in his last film, The Shootist.  In the same year, Clint Eastwood proved to be Wayne's successor as Western icon with another western that he directed and starred in - The Outlaw Josey Wales.  In sharp contrast to Wayne's patriotic, pro-war The Green Berets (1968), The Outlaw Josey Wales was a plea for peace and reconciliation four years after the US withdrawal from Vietnam.In an Eastwood documentary, Out of the Shadows, somebody said that Eastwood reacted against everything that Wayne stood for and footage is shown of Wayne rejecting the anti-heroes that Eastwood portrayed (""my characters are sometimes cruel but they are never mean and petty characters"").  In this documentary it is also said that during the filming of The Shootist, Wayne's character was originally meant to shoot one of his foes in the back but Wayne refused.  Don Siegel (who directed Eastwood in three earlier films, namely Coogan's Bluff, The Beguiled and Dirty Harry and also had a cameo appearance in Eastwood's directorial debut Play Misty for Me) responded: ""But Clint Eastwood would shoot somebody in the back!""  To which Wayne replied: ""Besides, I don't like High Plains Drifter [the first western directed by Eastwood, released in 1972].""Siegel agreed to Wayne's objections and his character was generally much more noble and sympathetic than the killer portrayed in the original novel.  Also, as noted in The Shootist documentary, the ending was revised to a more conventional, Hollywood ""happy ending"".The script of Unforgiven was also written in 1976 but Eastwood postponed making (producing, directing and starring in) his final, Oscar-winning western to 1992, when he was much older and more mature to explore his own myth and deconstruct his own legacy in the same way that he did to Wayne's legacy back in the 1960s and 1970s.  Eastwood dedicated Unforgiven to Sergio Leone (whose ""new kind of western"" introduced Eastwood as the new kind of action (anti)hero) and Don Siegel (whose Dirty Harry introduced Eastwood as the new kind of (anti)hero cop).And in 1976 a new actor and scriptwriter would emerge: Sylvester Stallone with his Oscar-winning Rocky.  The Rocky franchise would revive the triumphant Everyman portrayed by The Shootist co-star James Stewart in various Frank Capra films in the 1930s and 1940s.  (In the 1950s, Stewart tried to shed off his nice-guy image through the portrayal of the vengeful man-with-a-past in various westerns directed by Anthony Mann.  But, unlike Eastwood's Man With No Name, Stewart's protagonists at least had a context to ""justify"" their negative behaviour and have mostly rejected their past and urge for violence by movie's end).In the 1980s, Stallone would, similar to Wayne with The Shootist, transform a mean anti-hero (Green Beret Rambo) into a noble soldier re-winning the Vietnam War for America - just like Wayne's war heroes of the 1940s.  And, similar to Eastwood's Dirty Harry, play vigilante law enforcers with Cobra (1986) and Judge Dredd (1995).  But, while Stallone's career would continue to be undermined by his inability to move beyond violent, vigilante or noble boxer stereotypes, Eastwood's career would blossom through the creation of serious anti-violence films such as Unforgiven and Mystic River and the unconventional Oscar-winning boxing film Million Dollar Baby.",4,The torch has been passed to a new kind of western,1151280000,"06 26, 2006",2006,3358,"['1976', 'John', 'Wayne', 'appeared', 'last', 'film', 'Shootist', 'same', 'year', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'proved', 'be', 'Wayne', 'successor', 'Western', 'icon', 'western', 'directed', 'starred', 'Outlaw', 'Josey', 'Wales', 'sharp', 'contrast', 'Wayne', 'patriotic', 'pro-war', 'Green', 'Berets', '1968', 'Outlaw', 'Josey', 'Wales', 'was', 'plea', 'peace', 'reconciliation', 'four', 'years', 'US', 'withdrawal', 'Vietnam.In', 'Eastwood', 'documentary', 'Out', 'Shadows', 'somebody', 'said', 'Eastwood', 'reacted', 'everything', 'Wayne', 'stood', 'footage', 'shown', 'Wayne', 'rejecting', 'anti-heroes', 'Eastwood', 'portrayed', 'characters', 'are', 'sometimes', 'cruel', 'are', 'never', 'mean', 'petty', 'characters', 'documentary', 'also', 'said', 'filming', 'Shootist', 'Wayne', 'character', 'was', 'originally', 'meant', 'shoot', 'one', 'foes', 'back', 'Wayne', 'refused', 'Don', 'Siegel', 'who', 'directed', 'Eastwood', 'three', 'earlier', 'films', 'namely', 'Coogan', 'Bluff', 'Beguiled', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'also', 'had', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'Eastwood', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Play', 'Misty', 'Me', 'responded', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'would', 'shoot', 'somebody', 'back', 'Wayne', 'replied', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'High', 'Plains', 'Drifter', '[', 'first', 'western', 'directed', 'Eastwood', 'released', '1972', ']', 'Siegel', 'agreed', 'Wayne', 'objections', 'character', 'was', 'generally', 'much', 'more', 'noble', 'sympathetic', 'killer', 'portrayed', 'original', 'novel', 'Also', 'noted', 'Shootist', 'documentary', 'ending', 'was', 'revised', 'more', 'conventional', 'Hollywood', 'happy', 'ending', '.The', 'script', 'Unforgiven', 'was', 'also', 'written', '1976', 'Eastwood', 'postponed', 'making', 'producing', 'directing', 'starring', 'final', 'Oscar-winning', 'western', '1992', 'when', 'was', 'much', 'older', 'more', 'mature', 'explore', 'own', 'myth', 'deconstruct', 'own', 'legacy', 'same', 'way', 'did', 'Wayne', 'legacy', 'back', '1960s', '1970s', 'Eastwood', 'dedicated', 'Unforgiven', 'Sergio', 'Leone', 'new', 'kind', 'western', 'introduced', 'Eastwood', 'new', 'kind', 'action', 'anti', 'hero', 'Don', 'Siegel', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'introduced', 'Eastwood', 'new', 'kind', 'anti', 'hero', 'cop', '.And', '1976', 'new', 'actor', 'scriptwriter', 'would', 'emerge', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'Oscar-winning', 'Rocky', 'Rocky', 'franchise', 'would', 'revive', 'triumphant', 'Everyman', 'portrayed', 'Shootist', 'co-star', 'James', 'Stewart', 'various', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'films', '1930s', '1940s', '1950s', 'Stewart', 'tried', 'shed', 'off', 'nice-guy', 'image', 'portrayal', 'vengeful', 'man-with-a-past', 'various', 'westerns', 'directed', 'Anthony', 'Mann', 'Eastwood', 'Man', 'No', 'Name', 'Stewart', 'protagonists', 'least', 'had', 'context', 'justify', 'negative', 'behaviour', 'have', 'mostly', 'rejected', 'past', 'urge', 'violence', 'movie', 'end', '1980s', 'Stallone', 'would', 'similar', 'Wayne', 'Shootist', 'transform', 'mean', 'anti-hero', 'Green', 'Beret', 'Rambo', 'noble', 'soldier', 're-winning', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'America', 'just', 'Wayne', 'war', 'heroes', '1940s', 'similar', 'Eastwood', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'play', 'vigilante', 'law', 'enforcers', 'Cobra', '1986', 'Judge', 'Dredd', '1995', 'Stallone', 'career', 'would', 'continue', 'be', 'undermined', 'inability', 'move', 'violent', 'vigilante', 'noble', 'boxer', 'stereotypes', 'Eastwood', 'career', 'would', 'blossom', 'creation', 'serious', 'anti-violence', 'films', 'such', 'Unforgiven', 'Mystic', 'River', 'unconventional', 'Oscar-winning', 'boxing', 'film', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby']",N/A

But contrary to what most reviewers here, (and most people in general) think, he WAS NOT dying of cancer when he made the film, not at least according to the books, ""John Wayne, My Father,"" by Alissa Wayne, and ""John Wayne, American"" by Randy Roberts and James Olsen.  He was having some major health problems,with his heart, and had a heart valve replaced after the film's shooting wrapped up, but the cancer that took his life was still a year away when he made the film.That said though, you still come away with the impression that somehow, someway, the Duke knew this was the last one.  John Wayne was not saying merely good-bye to his fans, he was also burying a genre.  The Western has never, since Wayne's death, been a vivable film genre, with very few exceptions.This film is one of the best.  The casting is super, with hardly a mis-step anywhere.  Harry Morgan's protrayal of the city marshall is bit over the top once or twice, butnothing else.  Wayne, Bacall, and Ron Howard all blend together wonderfully, and you can FEEL the chemistry growing between J. B. Books (Wayne) and Bond Rogers, (Lauren Bacall) during their sniping at each other, helping each other..(Wayne tries to ""make it up"" to Bacall when he, defending himself, turns her home into a shooting gallery, and he falls in the tub and Bacall rushes to help him.) And as legendary ""shootist"" Books,now dying of cancer, (as Wayne himself would, just over 2 years later) prepares for his final showdown, he also prepares Bond for saying good-bye, gently telling her ""When you see me walk out that door, please Bond, no tears."" Oh there are classic John Wayne type lines too...""I won't be wronged, I won't be insulted,I won't be laid a hand on...I don't do these things to others, and I expect the same from them.""But basically, ""The Shootist"" is the classic story of a man who has outlived his time, and is trying to desperately to ""leave the stage"" with a certain amount of dignity.  John Wayne should have AT LEAST gotten an Oscar nomination for this film, if not the award itself, but the only ""award"" he got for it was the generations of fans, many not even born when the film was made, who have treasured this movie.No actor has ever had a more fitting farewell performance.",5,a poigant farewell to a legend and a genre,1125792000,"09 4, 2005",2005,2324,"['now', 'everyone', 'Shootist', 'was', 'John', 'Wayne', 'last', 'film', 'contrary', 'what', 'most', 'reviewers', 'here', 'most', 'people', 'general', 'think', 'WAS', 'NOT', 'dying', 'cancer', 'when', 'made', 'film', 'not', 'least', 'according', 'books', 'John', 'Wayne', 'My', 'Father', 'Alissa', 'Wayne', 'John', 'Wayne', 'American', 'Randy', 'Roberts', 'James', 'Olsen', 'was', 'having', 'major', 'health', 'problems', 'heart', 'had', 'heart', 'valve', 'replaced', 'film', 'shooting', 'wrapped', 'up', 'cancer', 'took', 'life', 'was', 'still', 'year', 'away', 'when', 'made', 'film.That', 'said', 'still', 'come', 'away', 'impression', 'somehow', 'someway', 'Duke', 'knew', 'was', 'last', 'one', 'John', 'Wayne', 'was', 'not', 'saying', 'merely', 'good-bye', 'fans', 'was', 'also', 'burying', 'genre', 'Western', 'never', 'Wayne', 'death', 'been', 'vivable', 'film', 'genre', 'very', 'few', 'exceptions.This', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'casting', 'super', 'hardly', 'mis-step', 'anywhere', 'Harry', 'Morgan', 'protrayal', 'city', 'marshall', 'bit', 'top', 'once', 'twice', 'butnothing', 'else', 'Wayne', 'Bacall', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'blend', 'together', 'wonderfully', 'can', 'FEEL', 'chemistry', 'growing', 'J', 'B', 'Books', 'Wayne', 'Bond', 'Rogers', 'Lauren', 'Bacall', 'sniping', 'other', 'helping', 'other..', 'Wayne', 'make', 'up', 'Bacall', 'when', 'defending', 'home', 'shooting', 'gallery', 'tub', 'Bacall', 'rushes', 'help', 'legendary', 'shootist', 'Books', 'now', 'dying', 'cancer', 'Wayne', 'would', 'just', '2', 'years', 'later', 'prepares', 'final', 'showdown', 'also', 'Bond', 'saying', 'good-bye', 'gently', 'telling', 'When', 'see', 'walk', 'door', 'please', 'Bond', 'tears', 'are', 'classic', 'John', 'Wayne', 'type', 'lines', 'too', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'wronged', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'insulted', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'laid', 'hand', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'things', 'others', 'expect', 'same', 'basically', 'Shootist', 'classic', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'outlived', 'time', 'trying', 'desperately', 'leave', 'stage', 'certain', 'amount', 'dignity', 'John', 'Wayne', 'should', 'have', 'AT', 'LEAST', 'gotten', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'film', 'not', 'award', 'only', 'award', 'got', 'was', 'generations', 'fans', 'many', 'not', 'even', 'born', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'who', 'have', 'treasured', 'movie.No', 'actor', 'ever', 'had', 'more', 'fitting', 'farewell', 'performance']",N/A

Brooks (John Wayne) no longer fits his society. The flimsy wooden shanties of the Old West have given way to sturdier construction. The streets are paved, and running water is freely available. Soon, electricity will be universal. The first primitive automobiles (then called horseless carriages) have replaced some of the horses. Dry cleaning is now available. What's more, the people no longer have a frontier mindset. In fact, some of them candidly tell Brooks that he is part of a bygone era.

In time, there will be no relief from the increasingly-agonizing pain, and the patient will have neither the strength nor the inclination to get out of bed.All kinds of people try to capitalize on his condition.

After all, this is one of Howard's final pictures as an actor and soon afterwards he picked up the directing reins where he's been sitting pretty ever since.  Wayne's own debut as a director was THE ALAMO and if you remember it was re-made not too long ago, not by Ron Howard but he was going to do it only the studio wouldn't back him up as to the huge budget the project required--exactly the same battles the Duke had fought way back in 1960.  Now, Ron Howard has been very clear about the debt he has owed the Duke, and it all stems from working together on this one Don Siegel project.  His recent flop Western film THE MISSING wioth Cate Blanchett is very much a tribute to Wayne's classic 1956 movie THE SEARCHERS.  Howard's career has been more expansive than Wayne's, but really it's a case of the apple landing not too far from the tree.  This lends their scenes together in THE SHOOTIST that extra edge of poignancy, it's like a glimpse into the heroic past of John Wayne, and into the directing future of Ron Howard.  The clips that you see at the beginning of THE SHOOTIST were chosen with care, and provide a brief panoply of the greatness that was John Wayne.  Though THE SHOOTIST isn't the best Wayne movie, not by a long shot, it was miles better than most films of the Bicentennial year 1976, and it seems to look better every year that goes by.It's great to see Ricky Nelson, Christopher George and Johnny Crawford in bit parts on the DVD version, where you can stop the action and say, ""Wow, that is who I thought it is!""",5,Wayne's Nudge to Ron Howard,1120176000,"07 1, 2005",2005,1926,"['always', 'think', 'movie', 'last', 'hurrah', 'not', 'only', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'way', 'Wayne', 'best', 'dissuade', 'young', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'becoming', 'gunfighter', 'almost', 'were', 'subtext', 'storyline', 'feel', 'John', 'Wayne', 'trying', 'subtly', 'dissuade', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'away', 'being', 'actor', 'nudge', 'gently', 'directing', 'career', 'one', 'Howard', 'final', 'pictures', 'actor', 'soon', 'afterwards', 'picked', 'up', 'directing', 'where', 'been', 'sitting', 'pretty', 'ever', 'Wayne', 'own', 'debut', 'director', 'was', 'THE', 'ALAMO', 'remember', 'was', 're-made', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'ago', 'not', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'was', 'going', 'do', 'only', 'studio', 'would', ""n't"", 'back', 'up', 'huge', 'budget', 'project', 'required', 'exactly', 'same', 'Duke', 'had', 'fought', 'way', 'back', '1960', 'Now', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'been', 'very', 'clear', 'debt', 'owed', 'Duke', 'working', 'together', 'one', 'Don', 'Siegel', 'project', 'recent', 'flop', 'Western', 'film', 'THE', 'MISSING', 'wioth', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'very', 'much', 'tribute', 'Wayne', 'classic', '1956', 'movie', 'SEARCHERS', 'Howard', 'career', 'been', 'more', 'expansive', 'Wayne', 'really', 'case', 'apple', 'landing', 'not', 'too', 'far', 'tree', 'scenes', 'together', 'THE', 'SHOOTIST', 'extra', 'edge', 'poignancy', 'glimpse', 'heroic', 'past', 'John', 'Wayne', 'directing', 'future', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'clips', 'see', 'beginning', 'THE', 'SHOOTIST', 'were', 'chosen', 'care', 'provide', 'brief', 'panoply', 'greatness', 'was', 'John', 'Wayne', 'SHOOTIST', ""n't"", 'best', 'Wayne', 'movie', 'not', 'long', 'shot', 'was', 'miles', 'better', 'most', 'films', 'Bicentennial', 'year', '1976', 'look', 'better', 'year', 'by.It', 'great', 'see', 'Ricky', 'Nelson', 'Christopher', 'George', 'Johnny', 'Crawford', 'bit', 'parts', 'DVD', 'version', 'where', 'can', 'stop', 'action', 'say', 'Wow', 'who', 'thought']",N/A

I suppose at least if you had the money and the press wasn't out to turn over all of your rocks. His friends and colleagues raised hell, showed up for work, and then raised some more hell. Of course we're not privvy to those stories, or at least the real ones, and maybe it was better that way. I tire of the check-out lines at Kroger and Jewel and Farmer Jack where you are forced to see young girls exploding out of their tops telling the secrets of what Paris and Tom and Brad did just last week in Nice or St. Tropez.Certainly the Duke went out in his own way, bombastic, bigger than life and not afraid (or reluctant) to take what he gave. And his lifelong friends are here too in The Shootist, Boone, Stewart, O'Brian, Bacall and Morgan. And this little kid Ronnie Howard whom I guess thought he had some future in movies.You just have to love Duke as Robert Stack's co-pilot Dan Roman ('Whistling Dan') in ""The High and the Mighty"" through ""The Searchers"" (my favorite) up to the end here in ""The Shootist."" Other actors flocked to him and though he was never accused of plumbing uncharted depths of thespian skills, he did what he did better than anyone else.His films of the west, probably the major part of his resume, were never duplicated. The only character actors that hold a flame to him now are Kevin Costner and Tom Selleck. And, regrettably, we really aren't interested in westerns any longer. (But see Duvall and Costner in ""Open Range"" to get a feel for the spaciousness of the country and the code that few lived by.)I guess that's what the characters The Duke played had, a code. And here Ron Howard tells us what that code was in the first words spoken in the movies. And the last words, 'Thank you, Sir.' were the last words spoken by Wayne on film.

I loved every moment of it and I think that after watching it everybody (including John Wayne's haters and people allergic to westerns) will admit that this is a great and important moment of cinema.This film tells the story of an old gunfighter (or ""shootist"" as they were in fact frequently known in the real Far West) John Bernard Books (John Wayne), who suffers from a terminal cancer. Knowing that he will die in a couple of months at the latest, Books comes to Carson City, Nevada, to confirm his diagnostic with a local doctor he trusts (James Stewart) and then organize his passing and funeral while still lucid and conscious. To spend confortably his last days in this world he takes a room at a pension owned by a widow (Laureen Bacall) and, somehow unwillingly, becomes for a short moment a kind of mentor/grandfather figure to her teen aged son (Ron Howard).What makes this film so exceptionnal is that when turning it, John Wayne was more or less in the same position as his character. Fighting since many years against cancer, he knew well that he was slowly losing and as he was already living on a borrowed time he also knew, that it was going to be, without any possible doubt, his last film. Veteran director Don Siegel (""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", ""The Killers"", ""Dirty Harry"") was aware of it too and he did everything he could to make certain that Duke's last film is as good as possible - and he succeeded.You should not expect many gunfights or other typical western features as there is no Indians, no stagecoaches, no camp fires with coffee and beans in the middle of cactuses - however there is a saloon, a sheriff and a merry undertaker (named Hezekiah Beckum and played by John Carradine)... In fact, the action of this film takes place in a time when both the Far West and ""shootists"" are already fading away and the first cars start to replace horses - and in Carson City the main character travels mostly by streetcar...What you will find in this film are incredibly rich and witty dialogs, frequently full of dark humor and a bitter/sweet story about a man who knows he is dying and who manages his increasing pain and fear by making minutious preparations to meet the Grim Reaper ""dressed in Sunday clothes, clean shaved and with the boots on"". It will not be an easy matter as all kind of parasites, attracted by J.B. Boots fame and the news of his imminent demise, start to crowd around him to get some dollars worth from him before he dies...After playing in ""The Shootist"" John Wayne managed to resist the cancer for three more years, before finally succumbing in June 1979. He left behind him a legacy of 184 films, of which the latter 102 (beginning with ""Stagecoach"" in 1939) made him into a unique legend of cinema.

123973,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,0792108868,magellan,"[5, 6]","Based on the novel by Glendon Swarthout, this movie tells the tale of a famous gunslinger who is heading for his last shootout. The movie follows the book pretty accurately except for a few changes: in the novel, the character of Gillum, the son of the widow played by Lauren Bacall, is a little different from how he was portrayed in the movie, and also the sheriff, played by Henry Morgan, has a much greater role. Swarthout also goes into much more detail about the pain J.B. Books experienced as the cancer progressed, which was glossed over in the move, perhaps for expedience sake or perhaps that wouldn't have played as well on the silver screen.For both movie lovers and John Wayne fans this movie is truly an elegiac swan song. Wayne plays the infamous, tough, smart old gunslinger of John Bernard Books, who has killed 30 men in gunfights, with the most nuanced performance in his long career. But now he is one of the last icons of a dying age, who, diagnosed with a terminal cancer, realizes that the way of life he famously symbolizes is dying just as quickly.Ironically, Wayne the actor was himself at the end of his career, The Shootist being his own cinematic swan song. In a Pascalian moment of art imitating life, he himself was dying of cancer.The movie is rich with this end-of-an-age, fin-de-siecle atmosphere and symbolism: most of the town sees Wayne as a perhaps heroic but nevertheless dangerous and lawless relic of a by-gone age. Others simply want to cash in on his fame by telling a romanticized version of his life story. Just before the final shootout, Wayne rides the new streetcar to the saloon, having sold his horse, with a pretty girl. They engage in small talk, as if this is just another ordinary day. But the contrast between the two couldn't be more stark; she is just starting her life, and Wayne is about to end his in a final blaze of glory.But although Wayne has a few admirers, most of the townspeople seem to feel the world will be a safer, although admittedly less interesting, place without men like him. And the town marshall, played by Henry Morgan of Dragnet and Mash fame, is openly gleeful at the prospect of Wayne's impending demise, which Morgan hopes will occur before some of the volatile circumstances surrounding Wayne have the opportunity to blow up in his face.Wayne truly went out in style with this film.  In contrast to his other more macho, action-oriented movies, this is a more thoughtful, reflective, introspective film that shows what Wayne could do when he was presented with psychologically more subtle, richer material. Except for the last climactic scene, when we are finally treated to a good, old fashioned shoot-'em-up, this movie is a far more cerebral and emotionally deeper film, and Wayne carries it off flawlessly with a performance that strikes a perfect balance, combining the toughness of the old gunslinger with the vulnerability of the dying cowboy whose way of life is dying with him.For example, in the case of Gillum, the teenager who worships Books as a hero, Books briefly becomes Gillum's surrogate father when he realizes that he must teach the boy in the short time he has left that there is a lot more to being a man than being quick with a gun. When all the boarders in Lauren Bacall's boarding house hastily move out after three gunslingers unsuccessfully try to murder Wayne in his sleep, he sells his horse for $300 and gives the money to Bacall so she won't lose her house.The movie sports numerous smaller roles and cameos by other famous Hollywood stars, and one of the pleasures of the movie is seeing so many other well-known actors and actresses from Lauren Bacall to John Carradine, Richard Boone, Scatman Crothers, a young Ron Howard, and others, who appear throughout the movie. It's as if they're all getting together for one final send-off, paying their respects to Wayne in his last screen appearance.The Shootist may never be as famous as Wayne's other, more dramatic films, but it might be the best performance he ever gave in a long, distinguished career.The IMDB website has some wonderful trivia about the film.

In fact, he had just come off of making a couple of tough-guy detective movies which, while I enjoyed them, weren't universally praised.The Shootist was Wayne's last film and what a film it was.Like the Wild Bunch and Monte Walsh, one of the themes of this film deals with the idea of the fading west of the 1860's to 1880's and how older. legendary and non-legendary characters of the west have to adapt to the changing times.In the Shootist, Wayne plays an aging gunfighter, J. B Books who rides into 1901 Carson City. He immediately goes to see an old doctor friend - played by another screen legend, Jimmy Stewart, who informs him that the pain Books feels in his lower back is, in fact, cancer and that he doesn't have long to live.Book's reputation proceeds him and needless to say, there are individuals who want to earn an instant reputation as the man who killed famed shootist JB Books.The entire movie revolves around the days that he resides in Lauren Bacall's rooming house and preparing for his death.I loved this movie from the earliest moments of the film when a montage of scenes of previous Wayne films was played depicting the life of JB Books right up to the final gunfight in the Acme Saloon.This movie is so good on so many levels.I always thought that John Wayne was significantly underated as an actor. In this film, he plays the dying man with a wonderful sense of dignity. His interaction with the Widow Bacall was very enjoyable to watch.And there were some good scenes with Scatman Crothers - Ron Howard, who plays Bacall's son and who knows all about the legendary Books. Harry Morgan, who plays the town's sherrif, can't wait to see Books dead - after all it's now 1901 and the west is changing and Morgan doesn't need to have his peaceful town shattered by other gunfighters wanting to claim the trophy known as JB Books.What a movie to go out on.Rest in peace, John, and thanks for countless hours of entertainment.",5,What  Way To Go Out,1170374400,"02 2, 2007",2007,2136,"['somebody', 'who', 'westerns', 'impossible', 'not', 'be', 'huge', 'fan', 'John', 'Wayne', 'especially', 'westerns', '.At', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'John', 'best', 'work', 'was', 'clearly', 'fact', 'had', 'just', 'come', 'making', 'couple', 'tough-guy', 'detective', 'movies', 'enjoyed', 'were', ""n't"", 'universally', 'praised.The', 'Shootist', 'was', 'Wayne', 'last', 'film', 'what', 'film', 'Wild', 'Bunch', 'Monte', 'Walsh', 'one', 'themes', 'film', 'idea', 'fading', 'west', '1860', '1880', 'how', 'older', 'legendary', 'non-legendary', 'characters', 'west', 'have', 'adapt', 'changing', 'times.In', 'Shootist', 'Wayne', 'aging', 'gunfighter', 'J', 'B', 'Books', 'who', '1901', 'Carson', 'City', 'immediately', 'see', 'old', 'doctor', 'friend', 'played', 'screen', 'legend', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'who', 'pain', 'Books', 'feels', 'lower', 'back', 'fact', 'cancer', ""n't"", 'have', 'long', 'live.Book', 'reputation', 'proceeds', 'needless', 'say', 'are', 'individuals', 'who', 'want', 'earn', 'instant', 'reputation', 'man', 'who', 'killed', 'famed', 'shootist', 'JB', 'Books.The', 'entire', 'movie', 'days', 'Lauren', 'Bacall', 'rooming', 'house', 'preparing', 'death.I', 'loved', 'movie', 'earliest', 'moments', 'film', 'when', 'montage', 'scenes', 'previous', 'Wayne', 'films', 'was', 'played', 'depicting', 'life', 'JB', 'Books', 'right', 'up', 'final', 'gunfight', 'Acme', 'Saloon.This', 'movie', 'so', 'good', 'so', 'many', 'levels.I', 'always', 'thought', 'John', 'Wayne', 'was', 'significantly', 'underated', 'actor', 'film', 'dying', 'man', 'wonderful', 'sense', 'dignity', 'interaction', 'Widow', 'Bacall', 'was', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'watch.And', 'were', 'good', 'scenes', 'Scatman', 'Crothers', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'who', 'Bacall', 'son', 'who', 'legendary', 'Books', 'Harry', 'Morgan', 'who', 'town', 'sherrif', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'Books', 'dead', 'now', '1901', 'west', 'changing', 'Morgan', ""n't"", 'need', 'have', 'peaceful', 'town', 'shattered', 'other', 'gunfighters', 'wanting', 'claim', 'trophy', 'known', 'JB', 'Books.What', 'movie', 'go', 'out', 'on.Rest', 'peace', 'John', 'thanks', 'countless', 'hours', 'entertainment']",N/A

123978,A1U48QKVYOQKWG,0792108868,MilesAndTrane,"[107, 111]","As movie genres come and go, the American Western was gasping for its last breath when John Wayne starred in &quot;The Shootist&quot; in 1976.  This story about a dying gunfighter counting down his last days in the New World is loaded with an extremely heavy dose of symbolism. This is a quiet western, completely emphasizing dialogue over action.  Directed by Don Siegel, a master of the western, the overall mood laments the passing of the Old West and its ideology.  I agree with other comments that this film has a slightly made-for-TV quality about it, but it's clear this is supposed to be a delicate look at the death of a revered cowboy, and not a wide-open prairie epic.  Like the character himself, John Wayne was dying, and provided for us what would be his final performance.  The last words Wayne ever said onscreen at the end of this film are the same words I'd say to him if I had ever met him - &quot;Thank you, sir.&quot;Set in Nevada in 1901, Wayne plays John Bernard Books, considered one of the last infamous gunfighters of the Old West.  Books settles into Carson City and learns he's dying of cancer.  Hoping to live his last few days quietly, he is befriended by a strong-willed widow (Lauren Bacall) who owns a boarding house, and her impressionable son (Ron Howard).  His presence becomes known, and enemies from his past emerge looking for a fight, while other so-called friends try to coax the legendary outlaw into letting a little fame rub off.  Books soon develops a tender friendship with the Bacall character, while becoming a mentor to her eager son, even though the local Marshall is pressuring him to leave town immediately.  Books soon figures out how to rid himself of his enemies and his debilitating condition in one swift stroke.  The cast is a large who's-who of western actors and they do an all-around great job; Lauren Bacall looks a little less glamorous than usual, but fits right in as the stern yet feminine widow.  Ron Howard gives a brash, &quot;aw shucks&quot; grown-up version of Opie, and Harry Morgan provides a little humor as the cowardly, trash-talking town deputy.  There's also a small but fantastic supporting role by the eternal Jimmy Stewart as the doctor who informs Wayne of his ailment.As the titular dying gunfighter, Wayne's role is not as complex as it was in &quot;The Quiet Man&quot; or &quot;The Searchers&quot;, but this is still some of the best acting he's ever done.  This is a solemn film, about someone reaching the end of their life and isn't afforded much time to rest and reflect because their past is catching up.  The sad perspective of the Old West as an antiquated era also shows how we sometimes have trouble trying to stay with the times when the rest of the world is rapidly moving forward.

True Grit was  mildly entertaining piffle, but Oscar-worthy?

But the one film that I think he truly deserved an Oscar for  was The Shootist.  Knowing that it was probably his last film, being a  cancer-ridden actor playing a cancer-ridden gunfighter, and a lifetime of  Western acting in every line on his face -- all this gives the film and his  portrayal of J.

Not everyone holds the Duke in such high esteem but I know that millions share my opinion.  There is an outstanding innovation in this movie that I can't recall seeing before.  It is when Ron Howard narrates the history of Western legend J B Books (Wayne's character) while the film show clips of Wayne from his early Westerns chronologically through his later ones.  There is also very  good acting by John Wayne.  The plot is a good one; an old gunslinger comes out of the wild into a town emerging into the Twentieth Century.  He choses this town because he wants to see an old doctor he knew from the past.  The doctor confirms that he has terminal cancer so the outlaw, realizing his death is a foregone conclusion, chooses how it will come about.  There are many characters that become a part of his final days, maybe a few too many.I enjoyed watching this movie again after a number of years.  It was (and is) better than I recalled.  However, my major objection to the movie is that it has a ""made for TV"" appearance about it.  Perhaps it the inclusion of so many TV actors (Ron Howard, Sherrie North, Harry Morgan, Hugh O'Brien, Richard Boone, etc) as opposed to so few movie actors (James Stewart, Loren Bacall, and John Carradine).  Part of it may come from the segues for each new day that seem tailor-made for commercial breaks.  Even the photography at times gives you the impression of video-tape.  However, if it WERE made for TV it would go down as the greatest made for TV movie of all-time.As I understand from his biographies, Wayne was pretty sure that he would bounce back again from his latest bout with cancer.  Thus, he was already looking at future movie prospects as this one was winding down.

Edward Merrell, Jr. ""emerrell2""","[0, 0]","Beginning with the excerpts from some of his earlier Westerns to provide the backstory and set the stage; and ending with a classic gun battle, this film is a magnificent tribute to the icon that was John Wayne...and to the old West. Wayne would die from cancer three years after completing this film and his characterization of J. B Books, a gunfighter (&#34;shootist&#34; in the parlance of the Old West) dying of cancer, is prescient and one of the most poignant in his long career. The Shootist&#34; was the 69th Western of some 250 films in his resume...it was his last film. Frankly, as good as this film is, it's difficult to watch if you're as much of a fan of Wayne and his movies as I am. In addition to Wayne, who is my favorite actor, my second favorite, Jimmy Stewart, is here too, in his last really good film role, as Doc Hostetler, who confirms the diagnosis of terminal cancer for Books. The cancer was likely Prostate, which was endemic to frontiersmen who spent a lot of time on horseback. Book, told by Doc Hostetler that he has only a few weeks left to live, decides to go out on his own terms before he becomes bedridden and racked w/pain. The balance of the casting is also superb, with Lauren Bacall in one of her best late-career performances and Ron Howard in his best performance as an actor. Also look for Richard Boone, Hugh O'Brien and Harry Morgan in fine performances too. Don Siegel's direction is superb throughout; that is especially true in the way he choreographs the climax gunfight, with the innovative use of the barroom mirror. Easy to see here why he was Clint Eastwood's favorite director. If you haven't seen this classic, and you love Westerns and John Wayne, then you need to cowboy up and give it a look...just be prepared for profound sadness after the final frame.",5,Wayne's last Western...and last film.,1361577600,"02 23, 2013",2013,1813,"['Beginning', 'excerpts', 'earlier', 'Westerns', 'provide', 'backstory', 'set', 'stage', 'ending', 'classic', 'gun', 'battle', 'film', 'magnificent', 'tribute', 'icon', 'was', 'John', 'Wayne', 'old', 'West', 'Wayne', 'would', 'die', 'cancer', 'three', 'years', 'completing', 'film', 'characterization', 'J', 'B', 'Books', 'gunfighter', '34', 'shootist', '34', 'parlance', 'Old', 'West', 'dying', 'cancer', 'prescient', 'one', 'most', 'poignant', 'long', 'career', 'Shootist', '34', 'was', '69th', 'Western', '250', 'films', 'resume', 'was', 'last', 'film', 'Frankly', 'as', 'good', 'film', 'difficult', 'watch', ""'re"", 'much', 'fan', 'Wayne', 'movies', 'am', 'addition', 'Wayne', 'who', 'favorite', 'actor', 'second', 'favorite', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'here', 'too', 'last', 'really', 'good', 'film', 'role', 'Doc', 'Hostetler', 'who', 'diagnosis', 'terminal', 'cancer', 'Books', 'cancer', 'was', 'likely', 'Prostate', 'was', 'endemic', 'frontiersmen', 'who', 'spent', 'lot', 'time', 'horseback', 'Book', 'told', 'Doc', 'Hostetler', 'only', 'few', 'weeks', 'left', 'live', 'decides', 'go', 'out', 'own', 'terms', 'bedridden', 'racked', 'w/pain', 'balance', 'casting', 'also', 'superb', 'Lauren', 'Bacall', 'one', 'best', 'late-career', 'performances', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'best', 'performance', 'actor', 'Also', 'look', 'Richard', 'Boone', 'Hugh', ""O'Brien"", 'Harry', 'Morgan', 'fine', 'performances', 'too', 'Don', 'Siegel', 'direction', 'superb', 'especially', 'true', 'way', 'climax', 'gunfight', 'innovative', 'use', 'barroom', 'mirror', 'Easy', 'see', 'here', 'why', 'was', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'favorite', 'director', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'classic', 'love', 'Westerns', 'John', 'Wayne', 'then', 'need', 'cowboy', 'up', 'give', 'look', 'just', 'be', 'prepared', 'profound', 'sadness', 'final', 'frame']",N/A

Geschke ""In search of History!!""","[0, 0]","In America there are a plethora of classic Western movies which will entice not only Americans to watch in enthrallment but also the World movie enthusiasts to join in in regarding the magic of the silver screen.  There are many Western classics to choose from including High Noon, Stagecoach, Shane, Who Shot Liberty Valence and True Grit.  However great these movies are the best to me without a shadow of a doubt is The Shootist.In what was to become his salutatory last movie John Wayne makes an emphatic statement to one and all that he was the greatest actor depicting the Wild Wild West in all its glory.  As a Western gunslinger whose oeuvre includes his code of ethics of how he conducted his life among the thugs of bad men in the West J. B. Books administered his version of Western justice.  This is the life he led and in this movie ends up in Carson City in January of 1901 where he is told by Doc Hostetler played by Jimmy Stewart that he is dying of cancer.  Not only is he delivered bad news Books is told that his time on earth is not very long.  In due course he is also told that his final days will be full of pain and agony.  Not the heroic death of such a respected gunman of the West.In consequence Books takes refuge in Widow Roger's boarding house to live out his final days.  Played by Lauren Becall Widow Rogers provide a spunky retort to Books intentions and creates not only a moral argument but a presentation to Books of true concern and yes perhaps love.  During all this Mrs. Rogers's young son Gillom played by Ron Howard become enamored with Books the noted gunslinger and is enthralled with Books and follows every wish and command of Books.Books does not want to die in desperate agony, he rather go out in blazing glory doing what he does best.  Very reminiscent of the scene in High Noon we see a final showdown at Carson City's saloon house named The Metropole Saloon.  This is a scene to depict the heroic ending of the ultimate Western gunman where all true men are considered for their true merits of living their lives by a code of Western ethics.",5,A Parting Western Tale,1391817600,"02 8, 2014",2014,2092,"['America', 'are', 'plethora', 'classic', 'Western', 'movies', 'will', 'entice', 'not', 'only', 'Americans', 'watch', 'enthrallment', 'also', 'World', 'movie', 'enthusiasts', 'join', 'regarding', 'magic', 'silver', 'screen', 'are', 'many', 'Western', 'classics', 'choose', 'including', 'High', 'Noon', 'Stagecoach', 'Shane', 'Who', 'Shot', 'Liberty', 'Valence', 'True', 'Grit', 'However', 'great', 'movies', 'are', 'best', 'shadow', 'doubt', 'Shootist.In', 'was', 'become', 'salutatory', 'last', 'movie', 'John', 'Wayne', 'emphatic', 'statement', 'one', 'was', 'greatest', 'actor', 'depicting', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', 'glory', 'Western', 'gunslinger', 'oeuvre', 'code', 'ethics', 'how', 'conducted', 'life', 'thugs', 'bad', 'men', 'West', 'J', 'B', 'Books', 'administered', 'version', 'Western', 'justice', 'life', 'led', 'movie', 'up', 'Carson', 'City', 'January', '1901', 'where', 'told', 'Doc', 'Hostetler', 'played', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'dying', 'cancer', 'Not', 'only', 'delivered', 'bad', 'news', 'Books', 'told', 'time', 'earth', 'not', 'very', 'long', 'due', 'course', 'also', 'told', 'final', 'days', 'will', 'be', 'full', 'pain', 'agony', 'Not', 'heroic', 'death', 'respected', 'gunman', 'West.In', 'consequence', 'Books', 'refuge', 'Widow', 'Roger', 'boarding', 'house', 'live', 'out', 'final', 'days', 'Played', 'Lauren', 'Becall', 'Widow', 'Rogers', 'provide', 'spunky', 'retort', 'Books', 'intentions', 'not', 'only', 'moral', 'argument', 'presentation', 'Books', 'true', 'concern', 'yes', 'perhaps', 'love', 'Mrs.', 'Rogers', 'young', 'son', 'Gillom', 'played', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'become', 'enamored', 'Books', 'noted', 'gunslinger', 'enthralled', 'Books', 'wish', 'command', 'Books.Books', 'not', 'want', 'die', 'desperate', 'agony', 'rather', 'go', 'out', 'blazing', 'glory', 'doing', 'what', 'best', 'Very', 'reminiscent', 'scene', 'High', 'Noon', 'see', 'final', 'showdown', 'Carson', 'City', 'saloon', 'house', 'named', 'Metropole', 'Saloon', 'scene', 'depict', 'heroic', 'ending', 'ultimate', 'Western', 'gunman', 'where', 'true', 'men', 'are', 'considered', 'true', 'merits', 'living', 'lives', 'code', 'Western', 'ethics']",N/A

I saw this film for the first time during it's theatrical release in 1976 (I think). Having previously seen El Dorado, Sons of Katie Elder, Big Jake, Cahill: US Marshal, Chisum and others of that ilk, my expectations were not high for The Shootist. The above-mentioned works are enjoyable and entertaining, but don't really measure up to She Wore a Yellow Ribbon, Red River, The Searchers, Rio Bravo, and other true classics. True Grit really stood out from his other later works, but mostly it seemed that his best work was behind him. Well, Mr. Wayne really knocked my socks off with The Shootist. An outstanding ensemble cast, superior performances, a compelling story- this film has it all. To learn after the fact that The Duke was dying of cancer at the time the film was made (and knew it) adds a dimension of realism- agonizing in it's intensity- to an already superior work.

For one thing, this is Wayne's last movie, and it's fitting that the movie cowboy icon bows out in a movie about a famous gunfighter coming to terms with his own mortality.  That the character has `a cancer,' as doctor Jimmy Stewart barks out at one point, makes it all the more immediate.  At the time THE SHOOTIST was filmed Wayne had already lost one lung to cancer.  Wayne, an understated and honest actor, is so perfect for the role it was a little surprising to hear, on the short `making of' documentary on the dvd, that George C. Scott was consider for the role.  Scott was a powerful and clever actor, and certainly would have done a good job with this juicy role, but he lacked Wayne's personal history with cancer and icon status. The cast is filled with strong character actors, most of them playing varying degrees of baddies.  Henry Morgan is the sheriff who can't wait for Wayne to kick the bucket.  John Carradine plays the gaunt mortician who has a particular interest in what happens after the bucket is kicked.  Hugh O'Brian and Richard Boone are a couple of old foes with serious scores to settle.But the movie is content, wisely, to concentrate most of its attention on character.  The heart of this movie is in the scenes between Wayne and Lauren Bacall, as the widow from whom he rents a boarding room from, and her son, played by Ron Howard.  Fans of Wayne, those familiar with his earlier westerns, will find these scenes quietly moving.  For my money THE SHOOTIST is a classic, contains what may be Wayne's best on-screen performance, and is essential viewing for those who love western movies.

124006,A2D63RN5LF14R2,0792108868,"THE BLUEMAHLER ""THE BLUEMAHLER""","[4, 6]","Marlon Brando is not the quintessential American male movie star. That honor belongs to John Wayne. John Wayne was a shrewd actor who carefully manufactured his on screen persona. For many, Wayne represents the All-American WASP, yet he was of Irish descent and a Roman Catholic. Most of the B western actors had a favorite horse. In his B western beginnings, Wayne had the horse Duke, yet he disliked horses, preferred slacks and dinner jacket to western duds, wore a toupee through most of his career, and felt more at home on his boat than he ever did on a ranch.In addition to being the archetypal cowboy, Wayne represented the ideal American soldier, yet he never served a day in the military. When the second World War broke out in 1941, many of Wayne's contemporaries, such as Jimmy Stewart, Clark Gable, and Henry Fonda, all enlisted. These actors were already established as ""A"" list stars in 1941. Even with Stagecoach (1939) behind him Wayne was not yet secure in his career and still languished in numerous ""B"" films. Wayne saw this as a golden opportunity, while the competition was away, to grab the number one spot, and he did just that. It was less a case of draft dodging, and more a calculating career move, one for which John Ford would relentlessly needle him ever after. The war interrupted the careers of numerous actors, such as George Reeves, who seemed to be on the way up, but had not yet established themselves in a large enough body of ""A"" productions. Upon his return, Reeves and many others found they had been virtually forgotten while they were away, never to regain their previous career position, let alone surpass it. So much for studio patriotism towards its contract players.Wayne symbolized American virtue, yet he had countless affairs with married women. Some maintain he was racist. In a 1971 interview he made naive and blatantly ignorant remarks about African Americans and Native Americans, yet he enjoyed working with African American co-stars, and was drawn to native American spirituality, an interest on display in his film ""Hondo"" (1953), produced and distributed by Wayne's own production company. Fellow star Jimmy Stewart was far more inclined to pronounced racist views. Wayne married three Mexican women and bedded many more of them. He was a rabid anti-communist during the cold war. Both Wayne and Howard Hawks saw the film High Noon (1952) as anti-American and both saw to it that scriptwriter Carl Foreman was blacklisted; Wayne bragged about that until the end of his life, yet Wayne also encouraged Hollywood to forgive and forget regarding Larry Parks' communism. Despite his republican leanings, Wayne began as a socialist and later sided with Jimmy Carter in giving back of the Panama Canal, much to the chagrin of fellow Republicans. Wayne's response was, ""We promised to do so and we should keep our word.""Wayne put on the facade of machismo, yet he was apt to be sentimental and easily shed a tear. His professionalism knew no bias. He lavished praise on the acting of Montgomery Clift, even if he felt Clift was ""an offish fag."" He enjoyed working with Rock Hudson, even though he was well aware of Hudson's lifestyle. Wayne also could express professional criticism of fellow actors. He frequently criticized Randolph Scott`s laconic non-acting (which Bud Boetticher used to great affect), yet Wayne also hooked Scott up with his best director. Fellow actors could certainly return the criticism favor to Wayne. Robert Mitchum recalled that Wayne wore his screen persona as grandiosely as he wore his ten gallon hat. For Mitchum, Wayne was all image and only image. The difference between the two actors' style lies in the difference between a great character actor and a great screen personality. Even the name John Wayne was a facade for Marion Morrison.Wayne partnered up with skilled directors and learned from consummate professionals. John Ford was slow to realize Wayne's potential. When the director saw Howard Hawks' ""Red River"" (1948), Ford was surprised by Wayne's performance and said, ""I didn't know the s.o.b could act."" Ford was a tyrant and openly ridiculed Wayne's masculinity frequently and mercilessly. Wayne consistently and quietly took Ford's taunting and sucked up to  the director. Actor Henry Fonda was not so inclined. When Ford punched Fonda on the set of Mister Roberts (1955), Fonda vowed never to work with Ford again, despite the fact that the two had a history of rich collaboration. Fonda kept his word.Intentionally or not, Ford was most likely instrumental in nurturing Wayne's increasingly public macho image. Other directors found Wayne more humble. Neither Mark Rydell nor Don Siegel, both liberals, wanted to cast Wayne (for The Cowboys in 1972, and ""The Shootist"" in 1976), but Wayne approached both directors, humbly asked for the part, and vowed utmost professionalism. Rydell and Sigel were both won over by Wayne and he delivered two of his better latter-day performances.Years earlier, Ford and Howard Hawks were just as instrumental for crafting Wayne's presence and persona as Wayne himself was. On screen Wayne represented virtue, integrity and honesty. Off screen, Wayne exhibited none of these qualities, but that matters only if one confuses the persona with the person. If one insists that the two cannot be separated, then turn to Gregory Peck, who was probably the greatest of classic Hollywood's western stars; he usually played men that fit the ideal mold of integrity, and actually lived up to that image off-screen (and was a better actor than Wayne to boot).Many, including Wayne himself, claimed that Wayne was no great actor. There is some truth in that, but he was a great reactor, and that was the most essential quality for movie stars of yesteryear. Wayne stunned John Ford and critics with Red River, but he surpassed that performance in Ford's The Searchers (1956), which may be the greatest film about America, bar none. His character was fleshed through rage, loss, despair, racist hatred, and redemption, which Wayne expertly expressed. Wayne gave exceptional performances in ""The Sands of Iwo Jima"" (1949) and ""The Quiet Man"" (1952), but his Rooster Cogburn in ""True Grit"" (1969), which won him a long overdue Oscar, was, comparatively, mannered (just as mannered in its way as Brando's Don Corleone was as in a different way).Wayne's last decade saw increasingly lazy performances in routine films. ""The Cowboys"" (1972) and ""The Shootist"" (1976) were notable exceptions. The former film understandably turned off most critics with its message of revenge for young boys, but Wayne gave a nuanced, emotional performance. ""The Shootist"" turned out to be his last film, and ,apart from ""The Searchers"", the best acting performance of his career.""The Shootist"" was not exactly a B budget, but it was not a solid A picture either. The producers knew that a dramatic film about a gunfighter dying of cancer was not going to reap box office gold, so most of the budget went into the superbly detailed sets and costume design, with little money left over for name actors. However, when the script, based off Glendon Swathout's well received novel, began circulating, the name actors started coming anyway, many so eager to be a part of the film that they drastically cut their salary demands (and, in Hugh O'Brien's case, did the film for free).Producers William Self and M.J. Frankovich and director Don Siegel were earnestly looking at George C. Scott for the lead role of shootist J.B. Books, until John Wayne contacted them, letting them knew he desperately wanted to do the film and lobbied for the part. The producers knew that Wayne's iconic status and wealth of films in the western genre would greatly benefit the film. Wayne was secured. After casting Wayne, Richard Boone, Hugh O' Brien, Scatman Crothers, Harry Morgan, John Carradine, Sheree North, Jimmy Stewart, Lauren Bacall, and Ron Howard (in the role of the young apprentice) all signed on quickly.Wayne, who had previously beat lung cancer, was ill throughout production. Unknown at the time, Wayne was in the beginning stages of the stomach cancer that killed him three years later. Illness aside, Wayne gives a superlative performance, acting with his expressive eyes and deftly interacting with his co-stars.In the novel, Ron Howard's character kills Wayne in the end. This was changed in the film, by Wayne himself. Some critics have felt this weakened the film, but Howard never feels threatening in the role. He comes off as a young man, raised by an overly fundamentalist mother, who simply wants to sow some oats; but it's just not in him to go the route of a J.B. Books and we know, in the end, that he will be the boy his mother wants him to be. This is a frequent pattern with men raised by religious mothers. The young man may stray a few miles off the course his momma has laid down for him for awhile, but he will return to her course. That side of this story is a slice of pure Americana and, with this casting, the change fits.Lauren Bacall is near perfect, as she usually is. Richard Boone is slimy perfection. That quality is what made Boone the perfect anti-hero protagonist, Paladin, in ""Have Gun Will Travel"" (1957), which easily remains the best western television series of all time. With post ""90210' television, preoccupation with surface prettiness has become the norm, and the stardom of someone like the ""ugly"" Richard Boone is likely never to be repeated.Jimmy Stewart, Scatman Crothers, , Sheree North, and Hugh O'Brien are consummate professionals and give ""The Shootist"" a beautiful sheen of great character acting.""The Shootist"" is, by no means, a sentimental film. It is the dawn of the 20th century. Books is an ugly reminder of the past and everybody wants him dead, gone and forgotten. That lack of sentimentality is to be applauded, but in the performance of Harry Morgan, as the marshal, it is taken too over-the-top and reduced to near caricature. The acting here falters badly and almost sabotages the film.Morgan's performance aside, the rest of ""The Shootist"" remains elegiac and poetic mythos. Books is told by his doctor, Jimmy Stewart, that he is dying of cancer: ""Can't you cut it out?""""I would have to gut you like a fish.""""You said I was strong as an ox.""""Well, even an ox dies.""So Books ambles away to find a room and die in peace. He winds up at the porch of Lauren Bacall's character, Widow Rodgers. Immediately, they rub each other wrong. Ms. Rodgers' son worships the Shootist, which worries his momma even more. Once Rodgers finds out about Mr. Book's past, she calls the Marshal, who finds out Books is terminal and tells the gunfighter, ""Don't take too long to die.""A nosy reporter gets a gun barrel poked in his mouth by Books and literally gets kicked in the daily duties for prying too far into Books' business. Books here is ugly. The reporter is annoying, but he certainly did nothing to warrant Books' rough treatment.Books' doctor gives him an opiate medicine and lets him know there will come a point soon when no amount of medicine will help. ""You will die screaming,"" warns the doctor, and strongly hints that Books should kill himself.Books and the widow take a ride out through the country and he tells her, with a twinkle in his eye, ""I have had a hell of a good life."" It is nearly the only sunny moment in the film, and a necessary one.Books gets a haircut, has his suit dry-cleaned, and tells his young apprentice to contact the local three gunslingers and have them meet him at the town saloon on the morning of his birthday, come Monday.Everyone but Ms. Rodgers and the faithful doctor are trying to wring the last profitable ounce of celebrity from their shootist--but even they have agendas, albeit well-meaning ones. Ms. Rodgers worries that the gunslinger will drive off her other lodgers (he does) and she wants to convert Books (she doesn't). The doctor wants his famous patient to die a befitting death, with his boots on (Books obliges him, securing his own legend).Scatman and Howard try to rip off Books for some money, the undertaker is eager for Books' potentially prosperous funeral, the Marshal feels Books is an obstacle to the future, several local men want to kill Books to secure their own reputation, and even the barber intends to hawk Books' hair for cash.The off and on relationship between Books and Rodgers gives ""The Shootist"" its meat. They are combative but they genuinely come to love one another. She helps when he slips in the bathtub. She knows Books is up to something. He is running out of medicine and doesn't want any more. He ceremoniously burns the newspaper he bought from the day he arrived, he has had his hair cut, his suit cleaned, but she promises to ask no questions.Come Monday morning everything is in place. Books departs in his Sunday best. The film falters briefly here, and could have used closer interaction between the two actors. When Ms. Rodgers sees him leave, she knows he is going to go die, but they stand apart in separate rooms. However, anyone doubting Wayne's skills as an actor should watch his face as he plays the scene in which he tells Miss Rodgers good bye.The shoot-out is expertly filmed by Siegel, in front of a long bar mirror. Books picks his first opponent by a mere glance in the mirror, he shoots Richard Boone through a table that Boone is hiding behind and sees O' Brien approaching through the reflection of shot glasses on the bar. As the shoot-out begins, the townspeople, knowing full well what is going on, gather together outside to listen at a safe distance. The violence of the 19th century west is having its final gasp inside the bar between Books and his opponents while the progress of the dawning 20th century safely witnesses it with understandable curiosity.Elmer Bernstein's score is one of his best, which is saying quite a bit. Howard's throwing of the gun, a rejection of Books' way, is overdone and contrived. Subtlety would have worked better. ""The Shootist"" is the near perfect coda to Wayne's mythos and vast body of work. The final scene, in which Books' dead body lies on the wooden bar floor, his face covered by a coat as Stewart and Howard look on, perfectly captures many of the preserved photographic images of dead 19th century gunfighters, killed in shoot-outs.The subject of ""The Shootist"" had been previously approached in Henry King's ""The Gunfighter"" (1950), which Wayne desperately lobbied to be a part of, but lost the role to Gregory Peck. Peck gave one of his best performances in this film. ""The Gunfighter"" is , indeed, a much more richly complex film, but the changed ending, along with the subplot relationship between Gillom and his mother, actually benefits ""The Shootist"" and sets it apart from the King film. Wayne's swansong has a beauty of its own in its elegant simplicity.John Wayne himself is not so simplistic. It is easy to dismiss him as a Republican thug. Indeed, he was that, but he was not only that and, of course, he was more than that. Wayne the actor was able to enshrine his own mythos, by choosing his own swansong, one that was almost perfect for his life's work, something few actors are granted.When ""The Shootist"" was released, most Wayne fans were disappointed. It was a drama, rather than an action film, and it predictably sank at the box office. Since then, Wayne's final film, like Henry King's ""The Gunfighter"", has developed a cult following and garnered admiration among many critics. Both films, their filmmakers, and their stars, belong to a bygone era. That is as it should be.*my review was originally published at 366 weird movies",4,JOHN WAYNE AND THE SHOOTIST,1285200000,"09 23, 2010",2010,15665,"['Marlon', 'Brando', 'not', 'quintessential',

This is what makes this movie so memorable.  I had to watch it twice to really enjoy it.  Wayne stars as a man prepariing to die of cancer.  Wayne at this time had lost a lung to cancer and was weak during the production.  I enjoyed the first scene right off the bat.  It shows a black and white montage of his previous movies.  While you're watching this, you hear him say, ""I won't be wronged, I won't be insulted, and I won't be laid a hand on. I don't do these things to other people and I expect the same from them."" Wayne at his best.The chemistry between Mr. Brooks and Bond, a crusty landlady is terrific.  It was appropriate the Jimmy Stewart (Man who Shot Liberty Valence) appear in Wayne's last film as a doctor.  He delivers the line, ""You have a cancer.""  Later, after describing the agony of cancer, he tells Brooks, ""You're a brave man.  If I was a brave man, I wouldn't die like that.""Thus giving the Wayne the idea.  Like Davy Crockett at the Alamo, he prepares to die fighting the good fight.  Removing three evils from the community.  On the final day, it is touching to hear Brooks and Bond saying good bye for the last time.  Likewise, he tells one pretty lady (Meldoy Thomas) that he hopes that she finds the right man soon.  Likewise he gives his pillow to the driver.Scenes of his kindess are spread throughout the film.  Especially when Miss Bond helps him after he slips in the bathroom.  This is a foil to the newspaper men, the marshall, the undertaker, and an old lady friend whose greed and exploitation irratate him.Like ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence"", it also deals with the changing west.  That final day is a ""false-spring"".

124008,A2Q13PHEXGR48Q,0792108868,T O'Brien,"[2, 2]","The Shootist is an excellent western that was John Wayne's last movie.  It is a fitting tribute as the Duke's character tries to live out his life with as much dignity as possible just as Wayne did.  J.B. Books is an infamous and aging gunfighter whose reputation preceeds him wherever he goes.  Books goes to visit an old friend, Doc Hostetler, in Carson City who tells Books that he is dying of cancer.  Hearing this, Books tries to live out his remaining days as peacefully as possible.  However, several gunfighters arrive in town who want to be the man that gunned down J.B. Books.  This was an excellent movie for John Wayne's last film.  At times, it is painful to watch the Duke because it is apparent he is struggling with the cancer that eventually killed him.  Nonetheless, a very entertaining western for John Wayne's final movie.John Wayne gives an excellent performance as dying gunfighter, John Bernard Books, who wants to live out his remaining days in peace.  His performance is one of his best as he tries to resolve his life as best as he can.  Lauren Bacall plays Bond Rogers, the woman who owns the hotel Books stays in.  The relationship between the two as they feel each other out is very well developed.  Ron Howard stars as Gillom Rogers, the young man who comes to idolize Books during his stay at his mother's hotel.  In a guest starring role, Jimmy Stewart is excellent as Dr. E.W. Hostetler, Books' old friend who diagnoses him with cancer.  The gunfighters gunning for Books include Richard Boone, Bill McKinney, and Hugh O'Brian.  John Carradine, Harry Morgan, Scatman Crothers, and Rick Lenz also star.  The DVD includes widescreen presentation, cast and crew interviews, and a theatrical trailer.

Everyone who is a John Wayne fan has seen this movie and knows these facts.  This is NOT the usual John Wayne Western.  John plays a great gunfighter who is dying of cancer.  The film is about how the character the Duke plays copes with this fact and how the the other characters cope with this fact-good and bad.  The other main character is played by Ron Howard, as an almost growm man who, in a boyish way, worships the idea of the gunfighter that the Dukes character represents.  The film takes place in 1901, and John Wayne knows that not only is he dying, but that the era he represents is also dying.  The good characters come to know that the gunfighter the Duke plays is a good man, whose death is tragic.  The end of the film shows this and shows that the Ron Howard character has learned not to want to be a gunfighter.",5,Goodbye,1359331200,"01 28, 2013",2013,906,"['shootist', 'last', 'movie', 'John', 'Wayne', 'made', 'also', 'great', 'movie', 'Everyone', 'who', 'John', 'Wayne', 'fan', 'seen', 'movie', 'facts', 'NOT', 'usual', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Western', 'John', 'great', 'gunfighter', 'who', 'dying', 'cancer', 'film', 'how', 'character', 'Duke', 'copes', 'fact', 'how', 'other', 'characters', 'cope', 'fact-good', 'bad', 'other', 'main', 'character', 'played', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'almost', 'growm', 'man', 'who', 'boyish', 'way', 'idea', 'gunfighter', 'Dukes', 'character', 'film', 'place', '1901', 'John', 'Wayne', 'not', 'only', 'dying', 'era', 'also', 'dying', 'good', 'characters', 'come', 'know', 'gunfighter', 'Duke', 'good', 'man', 'death', 'tragic', 'end', 'film', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'character', 'learned', 'not', 'want', 'be', 'gunfighter']",N/A

There are only three theatrical prints available for public showings and the owner of the theatre is a huge John Wayne fan and was able to get his hands on one of the prints for a nightly showing for one week.  I only mention this because this was the first time I saw THE SHOOTIST and seeing it in the theatre for the first time made the film even more impressive to me.I enjoy John Wayne films and Westerns, but am not a huge fan of either.  However, out of all the Wayne films I have seen, this is with out a doubt the best picture The Duke ever made. The movie was also the last film John Wayne ever made and he couldn't have gone out with a better eulogy.Wayne stars as a gunfighter in the twilight of his years named J.B. Books.  Books arrives in Carson City, Nevada to seek the medical opinion of a trusted doctor (Jimmy Stewart) who lives there. The doctor doesn't have good news for Books, he has a cancer and is going to die soon.  Books wishes to die in relative peace and seeks a room at a local boarding house. However, word spreads that the famous gunfighter is in town and is dying and every trigger-happy man from miles around seeks to get in on the action before Books kicks the bucket.The acting in this film is superb. John Wayne gives the most emotional intense performance of his career and he is backed by a strong supporting cast of Lauren Becall, Ron Howard, and Jimmy Stewart among others.The writing is great and the film contains some great lines. The film is full of the comedy of life, but all set against the backdrop of the serious drama of a dying man's last days. The scenery, sets, and location eloquently capture the beauty, promise, and chaos that existed at the the beginning of the 20th century.The film is a great example of filmmaking done right and is a fitting finale to the career of the great John Wayne.
