13958,A13QNGUB9IYTY4,0767817737,"A Hermit ""J.Hamric""","[16, 25]","At my risk of appearing insensitive and boorish, read the lowest ratings of this great film, look at how they are worded, notice the poor spelling, the outright hostility, and you will see the character of the type who disparage this kind of drama.It's not about the Bible, and it's not even about Jesus; they are secondary elements in this story of a very troubled woman with a history of medical and emotional problems, and an act of unconditional love, on her part, as well as the Savior's. I believe one of the aforementioned reviews calls leading lady Demi Moore a ""trailer camp bumer"" and they say she was ""choosen"" to save the world. What's a ""bumer?"" And how is someone ""choosen?"" This is what our High Schools turn out, year after year. That can be even more frightening than most movies. There's no ""trailer camp"" here. She and her husband live in their own home, and rent out a room above the garage. And it's not above some landlords and/or landladies to root through someone's belongings, wrong as it is. She is a seriously flawed human being, flawed, but in the end forgiven. She's not a particularly pleasant person, but why should she be? To sell more movie tickets? (""Moore"" tickets? I just kill myself sometimes!)Jurgen Prochnow is an interesting choice of actor to portray Jesus, namely because he doesn't look like Ted Nugent. And at no time in this film is he called by name. ""Fundies"" who would like to nit-pick will tell you that this is inaccurate, because he didn't return on a great horse, and didn't judge the world; didn't make himself seen by the whole world at his arrival. There is nothing anywhere that says he can't appear to somebody to see them through a hard time in their life, in preparation for the ""Great White Throne Judgement."" He was ready, but willing to back off if anything could avert it. And, why not a regular, nondescript woman for the fate of the world to hinge upon? That kind of reasoning would think, ""What? A stable? The King Of Kings wouldn't be born in a filthy stable!"" When you listen to someone criticize, consider who is criticizing, and how they are doing it; it puts the whole argument into perspective.One scene, a very important scene, one that any ""Christian"" should take note of, has the Jesus character visiting the retarded boy in his jail cell shortly before his scheduled execution. This was obviously a death-penalty state, the law of the land for a capital crime prescribing capital punishment, and while this condemned boy was praying in his cell for forgiveness, Jesus himself appeared to him. And without a word, he placed his hand on his shoulder, looking at him as an understanding father would, as if to say ""I know your heart, and I forgive you."" It's a moving scene.It's not the events themselves in this story that should be seen as central, the timing of such events could arouse interest in observant people, and in this story, it would be God's creation suffering ""labor pains"" as the character portrayed by Demi Moore was experiencing said pains.The imagery in this film is a character itself, central to it as any of the actors, scenes of dead soldiers and civilians a reminder of how ""evolved"" we are in today's world. There's a lot to be taken from this film, if you would only watch it as a story of sacrifice and devotion, and not one of religious dogma.As a P.S.; The last book of the New Testament is called ""Revelation."" It's singular, there's no final ""s,"" it's ""The Revelation To John,"" if you want to get technical. It's not called ""Revelations.""",5,INTENSE,1121817600,"07 20, 2005",2005,3543,"['risk', 'appearing', 'insensitive', 'boorish', 'read', 'lowest', 'ratings', 'great', 'film', 'look', 'how', 'are', 'worded', 'notice', 'poor', 'spelling', 'outright', 'hostility', 'will', 'see', 'character', 'type', 'who', 'kind', 'drama.It', 'not', 'Bible', 'not', 'even', 'Jesus', 'are', 'secondary', 'elements', 'story', 'very', 'troubled', 'woman', 'history', 'medical', 'emotional', 'problems', 'act', 'unconditional', 'love', 'part', 'as', 'well', 'Savior', 'believe', 'one', 'aforementioned', 'reviews', 'leading', 'lady', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'trailer', 'camp', 'bumer', 'say', 'was', 'choosen', 'save', 'world', 'What', 'bumer', 'how', 'someone', 'choosen', 'what', 'High', 'Schools', 'turn', 'out', 'year', 'year', 'can', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'frightening', 'most', 'movies', 'trailer', 'camp', 'here', 'husband', 'live', 'own', 'home', 'rent', 'out', 'room', 'garage', 'not', 'landlords', 'and/or', 'landladies', 'root', 'someone', 'belongings', 'wrong', 'seriously', 'flawed', 'human', 'being', 'flawed', 'end', 'forgiven', 'not', 'particularly', 'pleasant', 'person', 'why', 'should', 'be', 'sell', 'more', 'movie', 'tickets', 'Moore', 'tickets', 'just', 'kill', 'sometimes', 'Jurgen', 'Prochnow', 'interesting', 'choice', 'actor', 'portray', 'Jesus', 'namely', ""n't"", 'look', 'Ted', 'Nugent', 'time', 'film', 'called', 'name', 'Fundies', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'nit-pick', 'will', 'tell', 'inaccurate', 'did', ""n't"", 'return', 'great', 'horse', 'did', ""n't"", 'judge', 'world', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'seen', 'whole', 'world', 'arrival', 'nothing', 'anywhere', 'ca', ""n't"", 'appear', 'somebody', 'see', 'hard', 'time', 'life', 'preparation', 'Great', 'White', 'Throne', 'Judgement', 'was', 'ready', 'willing', 'back', 'off', 'anything', 'could', 'avert', 'why', 'not', 'regular', 'nondescript', 'woman', 'fate', 'world', 'hinge', 'kind', 'reasoning', 'would', 'think', 'What', 'stable', 'King', 'Kings', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'born', 'filthy', 'stable', 'When', 'listen', 'someone', 'criticize', 'consider', 'who', 'criticizing', 'how', 'are', 'doing', 'whole', 'argument', 'perspective.One', 'scene', 'very', 'important', 'scene', 'one', 'Christian', 'should', 'take', 'note', 'Jesus', 'character', 'visiting', 'retarded', 'boy', 'jail', 'cell', 'shortly', 'scheduled', 'execution', 'was', 'obviously', 'death-penalty', 'state', 'law', 'land', 'capital', 'crime', 'prescribing', 'capital', 'punishment', 'condemned', 'boy', 'was', 'praying', 'cell', 'forgiveness', 'Jesus', 'appeared', 'word', 'placed', 'hand', 'shoulder', 'looking', 'understanding', 'father', 'would', 'say', 'know', 'heart', 'forgive', 'moving', 'scene.It', 'not', 'events', 'story', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'central', 'timing', 'such', 'events', 'could', 'arouse', 'interest', 'observant', 'people', 'story', 'would', 'be', 'God', 'creation', 'suffering', 'labor', 'pains', 'character', 'portrayed', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'was', 'experiencing', 'said', 'pains.The', 'imagery', 'film', 'character', 'central', 'actors', 'scenes', 'dead', 'soldiers', 'reminder', 'how', 'evolved', 'are', 'today', 'world', 'lot', 'be', 'taken', 'film', 'would', 'only', 'watch', 'story', 'sacrifice', 'devotion', 'not', 'one', 'religious', 'dogma.As', 'P.S', 'last', 'book', 'New', 'Testament', 'called', 'Revelation', 'singular', 'final', 's', 'Revelation', 'John', 'want', 'get', 'technical', 'not', 'called', 'Revelations']",The Seventh Sign

No one really knew anything other than Demi Moore was in it and she was actually pregnant.  When the movie ended the entire audience got up and left the theatre in absolute silence.  I've never had this experience again.  The movie was food for thought.  It's based on the 7 signs of the apocalypse found in the Bible and The New Testament but it is applied to the current day's happenings with explanations throughout the movie plot to help people who are not familiar with those teachings understand.  With that being said it is not a bible thumping movie.  You are taken through a whole chain of events (with a couple of twists) with the story being centered mostly around this young mother who is pregnant and her attorny husband that unknowingly are participants in the revelations.  You may be able to guess the end of the story as it approaches but it doesn't soften the impact of the message.  It you're a thinker, it leaves you speechless.

13963,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,0767817737,Carl Manes,"[1, 1]","A series of tragic world events seem to signal the End of Days as prophesized in the Book of Revelations, with a pregnant housewife left to decide the fate of the world in THE SEVENTH SIGN! Demi Moore stars as expectant mother Abby Quinn in this religious thriller, which never manages to generate any real excitement or suspense. The large scale of ideas that are presented become siphoned by the rather narrow scope that director Carl Schultz fails to overcome creatively. We are only ever allowed to see the aftermath of each disaster, but we never witness the actual onslaught or destruction as they occur. What we are left with, instead, is Moore's character wading through a long series of discoveries that are as bland and predictable as they are tiresome. J&uuml;rgen Prochnow plays the only memorable role as the mysterious wanderer, David Bannon, with passable performances from Michael Biehn and Peter Friedman, as well. The final reveal in the end will come as little surprise, and offers even less logic or explanation.

This man is seen earlier in  the film walking among different places, cracking seals that unleash ruin  on the lands and seas. Abby, after much deliberation, begins to discover  that her tenant is not what she originally saw him to be, and suspects that  he may want to bring harm to her unborn child. She dreams of a man being  struck, and a soldier yelling, &quot;Will you die for him?&quot; This movie  definitely has a factor of suspense which is evident throughout most of the  picture, and the conveyance of each of the seven signs is very haunting and  original.

What makes Demi Moore's character so special is truly beyond me.  After all, she's hardly the Virgin Mary or anyone that deserves the kind of credit her character is inexplicably ascribed to; this is not even to mention the fact that Demi Moore is an actress of very limited ability and a horrible choice for this role anyway, but I digress.""The Seventh Sign"" is riddled with flashbacks that make absolutely ZERO sense in conjunction with the movie's action, and the viewer is constantly frustrated by the inexplicable flashback technique that is repeatedly employed and horribly executed in this movie.  By virtue of this fact, ""The Seventh Sign"" lacks any kind of cinematic structure or cohesiveness, and the movie simply does not flow well at all.  ""The Seventh Sign"" is a very tedious movie-watching experience that is very difficult to get through due to the movie's obvious lack of style and substance.  At times, the dialogue and action in the movie comes off as superficial, generic and laughable.  This movie was all about Demi Moore and an ill-advised attempt to show her off in the hope that she would bring in the money for this farce by virtue of her cinematic presence alone. As a movie, ""The Seventh Sign"" is a complete failure in every conceivable way.Now that I have explained why this movie sucks, the HorrorMan will have his personal rant regarding how pathetic ""The Seventh Sign"" really is.  Well, this movie is PUTRID people...it is indescribably horrible, not scary, laughable and a disgrace not just to any Christian but to any kind of intelligent existence, no matter how pathetic.  I was personally offended by ""The Seventh Sign"" in its vulgar interpretation and/or vision of the second coming and the end of the world to the extent that I found the movie to be blasphemous, and I certainly do not like this movie for that reason as I would hope that most people reading this review would understand, but the reason this movie gets ZERO stars is because it is, for reasons stated above, an absolutely God-awful movie.""The Seventh Sign"" has left its mark in the world of cinema however...it remains to this day a huge, yellow, festered zit on the proverbial nose of Hollywood.  I hope I have made my position clear regarding this trash.  Indeed, some people call this a horror movie...I just call it rubbish, and I make NO apologies for that.",1,0 STARS:  A genuinely REPULSIVE movie!,1113091200,"04 10, 2005",2005,3265,"['movie', 'Seventh', 'Sign', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'Second', 'Coming', 'Messiah', 'movie', 'NEGATIVE', 'rating', '0', 'STAR', 'rating', 'actually', 'too', 'high', 'maggot', 'waste', 'Seventh', 'Sign', 'pathetic', 'garbage', 'way', 'boring', 'stupid', 'nonsensical', 'rubbish', 'should', 'be', 'destroyed', 'leaving', 'copy', 'left', 'existence', 'take', 'up', 'good', 'space', 'planet.The', 'script', 'Seventh', 'Sign', 'simply', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'person', 'not', 'high', 'LSD', 'Seventh', 'Sign', 'radical', 'view', 'second', 'coming', 'end', 'world', 'plot', 'so', 'poorly', 'developed', 'viewer', 'becomes', 'aggravated', 'how', 'tedious', 'boring', 'absolutely', 'awful', 'movie', 'actually', 'movie', 'inexplicably', 'life', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'played', 'very', 'poorly', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'reason', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'character', 'save', 'world', 'What', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'character', 'so', 'special', 'truly', 'hardly', 'Virgin', 'Mary', 'anyone', 'kind', 'credit', 'character', 'inexplicably', 'ascribed', 'not', 'even', 'mention', 'fact', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'actress', 'very', 'limited', 'ability', 'horrible', 'choice', 'role', 'anyway', 'digress', 'Seventh', 'Sign', 'riddled', 'flashbacks', 'make', 'absolutely', 'ZERO', 'sense', 'conjunction', 'movie', 'action', 'viewer', 'constantly', 'frustrated', 'inexplicable', 'flashback', 'technique', 'repeatedly', 'employed', 'horribly', 'executed', 'movie', 'virtue', 'fact', 'Seventh', 'Sign', 'kind', 'cinematic', 'structure', 'cohesiveness', 'movie', 'simply', 'not', 'flow', 'well', 'Seventh', 'Sign', 'very', 'tedious', 'movie-watching', 'experience', 'very', 'difficult', 'get', 'due', 'movie', 'obvious', 'lack', 'style', 'substance', 'times', 'dialogue', 'action', 'movie', 'off', 'superficial', 'generic', 'laughable', 'movie', 'was', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'ill-advised', 'attempt', 'show', 'off', 'hope', 'would', 'bring', 'money', 'farce', 'virtue', 'cinematic', 'presence', 'alone', 'movie', 'Seventh', 'Sign', 'complete', 'failure', 'conceivable', 'way.Now', 'have', 'explained', 'why', 'movie', 'HorrorMan', 'will', 'have', 'personal', 'rant', 'regarding', 'how', 'pathetic', 'Seventh', 'Sign', 'really', 'Well', 'movie', 'PUTRID', 'people', 'indescribably', 'horrible', 'not', 'scary', 'laughable', 'disgrace', 'not', 'just', 'Christian', 'kind', 'intelligent', 'existence', 'matter', 'how', 'pathetic', 'was', 'personally', 'offended', 'Seventh', 'Sign', 'vulgar', 'interpretation', 'vision', 'second', 'coming', 'end', 'world', 'extent', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'blasphemous', 'certainly', 'do', 'not', 'movie', 'reason', 'would', 'hope', 'most', 'people', 'reading', 'review', 'would', 'understand', 'reason', 'movie', 'ZERO', 'stars', 'reasons', 'stated', 'above', 'absolutely', 'God-awful', 'movie', 'Seventh', 'Sign', 'left', 'mark', 'world', 'cinema', 'however', 'day', 'huge', 'yellow', 'festered', 'zit', 'proverbial', 'nose', 'Hollywood', 'hope', 'have', 'made', 'position', 'clear', 'regarding', 'trash', 'Indeed', 'people', 'call', 'horror', 'movie', 'just', 'call', 'rubbish', 'make', 'apologies']",The Seventh Sign

When those signs start appearing around the world, the only question is whether the world can be saved. It seems that the answer to that question lies in the grasp of one person. Who is that one person to be?A very young Demi Moore stars as Abby Quinn, a pregnant woman with a history of miscarriages. She and her husband are eagerly and hopefully awaiting their baby. He is a lawyer who is passionate about his clients. One, in particular, the Word of God Killer, has some significance in how events unfold in the film. The Quinns live in a lovely home with an apartment over their garage that they rent to a mysterious stranger (Jurgen Prochnow) who purports to be a teacher of ancient languages.Unfortunately, Abby has some issues, as well as a penchant for having a recurring dream that figures prominently in things to come. As the events unfold in the film, one has to suspend belief, as Abby does things that no one having a high risk pregnancy would do, and the plot spirals into being almost ridiculous at times. Still, notwithstanding its deficiencies, the film manages to entertain the viewer and keep one's interest.The film has some excellent performances, including that of Peter Friedman as a man of the cloth with a long past. It is Jurgen Prochnow, however, who steals the entire show as David Bannon, the mysterious teacher of ancient languages who seems to carry the weight of the world upon his shoulders. Who he ultimately turns out to be is entirely believable. His performance is so compelling that those sharing a scene with him fade into the background. While exuding sensitivity and caring, he also manages to be one of the sexiest men on the silver screen.

13990,AJUEE2C2EJ0V3,0767817737,Paperbackstash,"[1, 2]","The Seventh Sign is a pure religion sub-genre addition. Some may instead view as more of a drama but the horror elements are there and it was classed in our genre.Indeed it does not have a high body count, much gore, or attempt to really frighten - but it does deal with a terrifying premise: the apocalypse. It also has some disturbing images woven throughout and is darkly themed. It is more of a horror meant to disturb and deeply interest than lightly entertain or terrify.Demi Moore is surprisingly exceptional in the role of a woman who wants a baby more than anything in the wolrd. Michael Beign is her husband, a man attempting to save someone off of death row. We love when either of these are on screen and they both shine. Michael Beign is the gorgeous type of guy already familiar with horror - from The Terminator and Aliens to other sci/fi, disturbing roles. As far as I know this is a first for Moore but she conveys fear well and causes sympathy. What also helps is that her character is actually interesting. We see her side of things and get into her mind a bit, making the movie play out even better.The plot itself is that the apocalypse has come around and it all evolves around the upcoming death of an unmentioned person/situation who we later see in the movie. The movie involves an old poem/source called ""The Gulf"" which is also known as the hall of souls. A mysterious stranger comes to town and rents out the room subletted by Demi Moore's character Abby. It is shown by the very start that he is the ressurected Jesus, who has come to start the signs and cause destruction. After each seal is broken another nightmare ensues.  An a subplot there is a situation involving Abbys unborn child - apparently before this pregnancy she had not been able to carry her last infant to full term. Her mental stability is based on the survival of her pregnancy and the stress of the events coming forth are not helping. We get to see her flashbacks, dreams, fears, excitement for children, worries for herself, ect., while she is trying to figure who this stranger is and if he's in any way part of everything that's going on. Other mysteries insue and we as the audience are drawn in and held tight. The husband Michael is out of the picture a lot of the time working at his job but he is apparently worried about the health of Abbie. When he's there he adds, when he's not the plot continues without fail.So overall, if Abby can figure out this mystery, she will be the woman that gives the world a second chance and stops the end of all mankind.Unfortunitely she doesnt know what the hell is going on and we follow her through different confusing paths. She thinks ""Jesus"" is actually some madman into some sort of strange rituals at first and then keeps evolving her opinion. Her emotional problems dont help her at all but are a great addition to the film.Along with unusual dreams and freaky flashes, beautiful music and story emotion on all levels, the Seventh Sign is a classic religious film often overlooked.People not of the Christian faith may have a little more trouble losing theirselves in the plot but if so I pity them. To me watching a movie effectively comes with the ability to open your mind to the beliefs and settings of the characters, no matter how foreign or alien the situation appears to you. I can watch The Craft or another film based on pagan religion, satanism, and what not - there is no reason an athiest cannot enjoy a film speaking of Christianity in high terms.

It's quite shameless in the way it invents additional verses to the Bible to support its hotchpotch of apocalyptic predictions and throws in elements from everything from The Wandering Jew to Rosemary's Baby, yet it all works surprisingly well, mostly because the cast and director Carl Schultz take it completely seriously, even pulling off a surprisingly touching ending. Clearly the Fundamentalists were too busy threatening to firebomb the theatres playing The Last Temptation that season to note the film's own unique interpretation of a p***ed-off Christ who has lost all patience with humanity: ""I came as the lamb but I return as the lion.""No extras, but a fairly good 2.35:1 widescreen transfer.",4,"""I came as the lamb but I return as the lion.""",1208736000,"04 21, 2008",2008,874,"['Seventh', 'Sign', 'surprisingly', 'effective', 'piece', 'Apocalyptic', 'guf', 'days', 'when', 'Demi', 'Morre', 'breasts', 'were', 'still', 'real', 'could', 'still', 'play', 'likeable', 'characters', 'quite', 'shameless', 'way', 'additional', 'verses', 'Bible', 'support', 'hotchpotch', 'apocalyptic', 'predictions', 'throws', 'elements', 'everything', 'Wandering', 'Jew', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', 'yet', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'mostly', 'cast', 'director', 'Carl', 'Schultz', 'take', 'completely', 'seriously', 'even', 'pulling', 'off', 'surprisingly', 'touching', 'ending', 'Clearly', 'Fundamentalists', 'were', 'too', 'busy', 'threatening', 'firebomb', 'theatres', 'playing', 'Last', 'Temptation', 'season', 'note', 'film', 'own', 'unique', 'interpretation', 'p***ed-off', 'Christ', 'who', 'lost', 'patience', 'humanity', 'came', 'lamb', 'return', 'lion', 'extras', 'fairly', 'good', '2.35:1', 'widescreen', 'transfer']",The Seventh Sign
13998,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,0767817737,Wuchak,"[3, 5]","Released in 1988, ""The Seventh Sign"" is a creative take on the Bible's end-of-the-world prophecies: Apocalyptic judgments seem to be occurring all over the world as an unbelieving California couple (Demi Moore and Michael Biehn) are preparing for their first child. A mysterious stranger rents an apartment from them and Demi slowly discovers that she and her baby are the focal point of the end or possibly humanity's second chance.Jesus Christ Himself is one of the main characters and this is one of the best depictions of Christ in film, if not THE best. He's by far the most interesting character in the movie (I'd tell you the actor playing the role but I don't want to give away who the Messiah is as the movie keeps it kinda discreet, not that it's too hard to figure out). I just wish they gave JC more screentime and dialogue since he's so intriguing; it would have made for a much more compelling picture. As it is, the film focuses on Demi and she's just not that interesting a character.I enjoy movies that make you reflect and try to figure out. This is such a film. Some have criticized that the story is nonsensical, but it's all there clear as a bell if you reflect on it.One reviewer criticizes that the film lacks substance, yet the story deals with nothing less than the salvation of humanity via sacrifice, faith, hope and love; plus Jesus Christ Himself is a major character. I think this qualifies as substance.If you're having trouble figuring the story out ask yourself this question: Why is Jesus Christ attracted like a magnet to Demi and her baby? Once you have that figured out the story makes perfect sense.I'd also like to point out that the film is expertly made on practically every level. This ain't no low-budget fare.People seem to have trouble categorizing ""The Seventh Sign"" because it's so unique. I would say it's a mystery/horror film, but don't think ""horror"" in the sense of a slasher flick, ""Seventh Sign"" is more classy than that. Although there's loads of dead bodies and blood there's hardly any cussing and no youths getting naked.As far as Biblical eschatology goes, the story gets it fairly accurate up to a point but then takes a creative turn. If such creative license with Christian prophecy offends you then stay away. Regardless, keep in mind that the main message of the film is completely Biblical, i.e. salvation only comes via the spilling of blood and faith, hope & love.Unfortunately the film has a bit of a tedious vibe despite the numerous intriguing aspects, which is a major flaw considering it only runs about 90 minutes. Again, they should have given JC more screentime and dialogue as he is definitely the most interesting character. Because of this tedious vibe I give the film an overall strong 3/5 Stars or C+ (if I was in a better mood I'd give it a weak 4/5 Stars or B-). In other words, although ""The Seventh Sign"" has some undeniably great elements, overall it's neither great nor horrible; it's somewhere inbetween. Regardless, it's very worthwhile if the subject matter piques your interest.",3,Creative take on the Apocalypse,1245196800,"06 17, 2009",2009,3068,"['Released', '1988', 'Seventh', 'Sign', 'creative', 'take', 'Bible', 'end-of-the-world', 'prophecies', 'Apocalyptic', 'judgments', 'seem', 'be', 'occurring', 'world', 'unbelieving', 'California', 'couple', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'Michael', 'Biehn', 'are', 'preparing', 'first', 'child', 'mysterious', 'stranger', 'rents', 'apartment', 'Demi', 'slowly', 'baby', 'are', 'focal', 'point', 'end', 'possibly', 'humanity', 'second', 'chance.Jesus', 'Christ', 'Himself', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'one', 'best', 'depictions', 'Christ', 'film', 'not', 'THE', 'best', 'far', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'movie', ""'d"", 'tell', 'actor', 'playing', 'role', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'who', 'Messiah', 'movie', 'kinda', 'discreet', 'not', 'too', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'just', 'wish', 'gave', 'JC', 'more', 'screentime', 'dialogue', 'so', 'intriguing', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'much', 'more', 'compelling', 'picture', 'film', 'Demi', 'just', 'not', 'interesting', 'character.I', 'enjoy', 'movies', 'make', 'reflect', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'such', 'film', 'have', 'criticized', 'story', 'nonsensical', 'there', 'clear', 'bell', 'reflect', 'it.One', 'reviewer', 'film', 'substance', 'story', 'deals', 'nothing', 'less', 'salvation', 'humanity', 'sacrifice', 'faith', 'hope', 'love', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'Himself', 'major', 'character', 'think', 'qualifies', 'substance.If', ""'re"", 'having', 'trouble', 'figuring', 'story', 'ask', 'question', 'Why', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'attracted', 'magnet', 'Demi', 'baby', 'Once', 'have', 'figured', 'out', 'story', 'perfect', 'sense.I', ""'d"", 'also', 'like', 'point', 'out', 'film', 'expertly', 'made', 'practically', 'level', 'ai', ""n't"", 'low-budget', 'fare.People', 'seem', 'have', 'trouble', 'categorizing', 'Seventh', 'Sign', 'so', 'unique', 'would', 'say', 'mystery/horror', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'horror', 'sense', 'slasher', 'flick', 'Seventh', 'Sign', 'more', 'classy', 'loads', 'dead', 'bodies', 'blood', 'hardly', 'cussing', 'youths', 'getting', 'naked.As', 'far', 'Biblical', 'eschatology', 'story', 'fairly', 'accurate', 'up', 'point', 'then', 'creative', 'turn', 'such', 'creative', 'license', 'Christian', 'prophecy', 'then', 'stay', 'away', 'Regardless', 'keep', 'mind', 'main', 'message', 'film', 'completely', 'Biblical', 'i.e', 'salvation', 'only', 'spilling', 'blood', 'faith', 'hope', 'love.Unfortunately', 'film', 'bit', 'tedious', 'vibe', 'numerous', 'intriguing', 'aspects', 'major', 'flaw', 'considering', 'only', '90', 'minutes', 'Again', 'should', 'have', 'given', 'JC', 'more', 'screentime', 'dialogue', 'definitely', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'tedious', 'vibe', 'give', 'film', 'overall', 'strong', '3/5', 'Stars', 'C+', 'was', 'better', 'mood', ""'d"", 'give', 'weak', '4/5', 'Stars', 'B-', 'other', 'words', 'Seventh', 'Sign', 'undeniably', 'great', 'elements', 'overall', 'great', 'horrible', 'somewhere', 'inbetween', 'Regardless', 'very', 'worthwhile', 'subject', 'matter', 'piques', 'interest']",The Seventh Sign
