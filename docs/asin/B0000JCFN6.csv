I am glad to have it, as I will view it about once a month.  However, I found on playing it the first time that the volume was lower than I expected, so had to increase it via the TV volume.  A small problem and a slight disappointment, but otherwise I am pleased to have it.  Lou Diamond Phillips and Fred Ward (who play Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn respectively) are two of my favorites, also.  Screenplay follows the book plot pretty close.

A dark wind has entered his soul""Jim Chee, local rookie cop is guarding a windmill that is periodically being put out of business when he hears a plane crash. This leads to many mysteries including a body with a message in its mouth. This takes place on the reservation so we have an overlap of authority in the search for clues, between the local authorities (Lou Diamond Phillips as Officer Jim Chee, Fred Ward as Lieutenant Joe Leaphorn) and the Feds. There is also overlapping rights between the Hopi and the Navaho.If you have read Tony Hillerman then you will recognize your old friends. It is also nice to see the area where the story takes place around the Navajo reservation in Arizona and New Mexico. Of course being a different media there is some consolidation of characters and allowance for acting stile over written character description.

While the story is outstanding, the acting is wooden.  Lou Diamond Phillips is a good actor, but he just can't pull off Jim Chee.  Perhaps I would have had a different opinion if I hadn't seen Adam Beach's outstanding performance as Jim Chee first.  I won't even get in to Fred Ward as Joe Leaphorn.  Suffice it to say that Dark Wind is a Jim Chee novel, so there is little of Joe Leaphorn to be screwed up.On the tech side, this is a really lousy DVD presentation.  It is just a glorified VHS transfer.  The sound is 2 channel, not 5.1.  The presentation is full frame rather than widescreen, and there are plenty of funny intrusions from boom mikes and sun awnings.Nevertheless, as cheap as this is going for, I am glad I bought it.  The story is fantastic.  Really good mystery.  Only two complaints about the writing.  First, there are several totally unnecessary uses of the F-word, as if they were just trying to get an R rating.  I don't mind if profanity is necessary to the story, but even the actors sound like they don't think the word fits their lines.  Second, do we really have to hear EVERYTHING that goes on in Chee's head?  I mean really, the near constant voice overs get rather irritating.If you want a really good adaptation of a Hillerman novel, try Skinwalkers or Coyote Waits.

Whoops!  Chee started noticing the Kachina dolls in his living quarters.Seeing the mutilated Navajo [on Hopi land] was a shock and left me wondering about a Skinwalker, who was he?When Chee is ordered to find out who is tinkering with the well and sees the plane go down, he is suddenly plunged into the world of mystery, witchcraft [which I don't think he likes], F.B.I. agents and revenge.

This version, directed by Robert Redford and starring Lou Diamond Phillips as Jim Chee and the PBS version with Adam Beach as Chee and Wes Studi as Leaphorn.  What the author, Tony Hillerman, said about the actors in the making of ""Coyote Waits"" (one of the other PBS specials) was that Wes Studi was the man he saw as Leaphorn and he was beginning to see Jimmy Chee as a good deal more handsome after Adam Beach played him.Well, I'm only seeing Adam Beach as Chee now, myself.  And Fred Ward may be a good actor elsewhere, but Wes Studi's face was what I saw when I read Hillerman's novels, too.The story in short.  Jim Chee (Phillips) is a newly assigned cop to this beat of the Navajo-Hopi rez.  His lieutenant Leaphorn (Ward) sets him on staking out the windmills to see who's destroying them.  In the process, he finds a murdered man and a bigger crime than the windmill massacres.  A drug smuggler's plane crash lands near the spot and Chee finds a dead man inside.  The Federal officers and Leaphorn think he's involved. With the help of a Hopi Deputy (Gary Farmer) he sets out to solve the crime and clear several people's good names.In this particular installation of the Hillerman based films, witchcraft and superstition are strong.  The traditions are fascinating and the plot is complex.
