1346297,ARNAOSKQZMM2J,B003IHUI0O,Amanda,"[0, 0]","I thought Prince of Persia was an odd franchise for Disney and Bruckheimer to choose for their newest film saga. It's from a video game franchise that hasn't been too popular for over 10 years. Perhaps Prince of Persia was attractive because being the IP was so cheap, perhaps the owners thought a movie deal could re-boot the franchise. No matter what the deciding factor was, it was still an odd choice. Persian warriors just don't have the same cultural relevance or significance that, say, pirates do.Not only are Persian warriors an odd choice, but so was Jake Gyllenhaal as the dashing hero Dastan. While some reviewers have trouble seeing him as an action hero, that didn't bother as much as the fact that he didn't look Persian at all. Many of the other actors, thankfully, did, but Jake wasn't believable. On the other hand Gemma Arterton, as princess Tamina, definitely looked the part, but isn't a very compelling actress (plus her high-pitched voice drove me insane). The other characters pass as Persian, but there is so little screen time dedicated to anyone else that, at times, I almost forgot about the whole Persian thing.The plot of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is also a little unbelievable (almost video game-like surprise, surprise). The rather short exposition explains that the sheik of Persia adopted young Dastan as his son after witnessing Dastan's actions to help someone he didn't know. Years later Dastan has grown up to a fierce warrior prince of Persia and helps his brothers take over a neighboring kingdom where they capture Princess Tamina. But after Dastan is framed for his father's murder, he flees with Tamina into the desert and must clear his name. Meanwhile, he learns the secrets of a strange dagger that can alter time.Filled with impressive special effects and fun (though slightly robotic and video game-flavored) action sequences, Prince of Persia: The Sands of the Time is a semi-entertaining, though poorly paced, movie. The opening, for example, feels a little slow and the middle drags horribly. But I admit that as the secrets started to unravel and the plot continued, it became much more interesting and I became more invested in the movie. The biggest highlight for me was when the bandits showed up in the middle of the movie. Though practically irrelevant to the plot and obviously only included for comic relief, they actually started to make things interesting and got me excited about some of the characters, plus it was nice to have someone else on the screen other than Dastan and Tamnia for once. Once I got past my initial shock over the film's slow pace, I was able to enjoy it enough.Though it does have its holes, Prince of Persia is an acceptable and somewhat fun action movie -at least once you get past the horribly boring beginning/middle. If you go in just to enjoy the action sequences and special effects it's fine, but not stellar in the area of plot or character. I know Disney really wants Prince of Persia to be the next Pirates of the Caribbean, but it's just not. I'm not sure if this will spawn a movie franchise like they hope because the unfortunate reality is that, due to the $200 million (plus a $100 million marketing budget) flick's poor box office numbers thus far, things don't look good.",3,"A fun adventure, but not the next Pirates",1275609600,"06 4, 2010",2010,3285,"['thought', 'Prince', 'Persia', 'was', 'odd', 'franchise', 'Disney', 'Bruckheimer', 'choose', 'newest', 'film', 'saga', 'video', 'game', 'franchise', ""n't"", 'been', 'too', 'popular', '10', 'years', 'Perhaps', 'Prince', 'Persia', 'was', 'attractive', 'being', 'IP', 'was', 'so', 'cheap', 'perhaps', 'owners', 'thought', 'movie', 'deal', 'could', 're-boot', 'franchise', 'matter', 'what', 'deciding', 'factor', 'was', 'was', 'still', 'odd', 'choice', 'Persian', 'warriors', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'cultural', 'relevance', 'significance', 'say', 'only', 'are', 'Persian', 'warriors', 'odd', 'choice', 'so', 'was', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'dashing', 'hero', 'Dastan', 'reviewers', 'have', 'trouble', 'seeing', 'action', 'hero', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'as', 'much', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'Persian', 'Many', 'other', 'actors', 'thankfully', 'did', 'Jake', 'was', ""n't"", 'believable', 'other', 'hand', 'Gemma', 'Arterton', 'princess', 'Tamina', 'definitely', 'looked', 'part', ""n't"", 'very', 'compelling', 'actress', 'high-pitched', 'voice', 'drove', 'insane', 'other', 'characters', 'pass', 'Persian', 'so', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'dedicated', 'anyone', 'else', 'times', 'almost', 'forgot', 'whole', 'Persian', 'thing.The', 'plot', 'Prince', 'Persia', 'Sands', 'Time', 'also', 'little', 'unbelievable', 'almost', 'game-like', 'surprise', 'surprise', 'rather', 'short', 'exposition', 'sheik', 'Persia', 'adopted', 'young', 'Dastan', 'son', 'witnessing', 'Dastan', 'actions', 'help', 'someone', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'Years', 'later', 'Dastan', 'grown', 'up', 'fierce', 'warrior', 'prince', 'Persia', 'brothers', 'take', 'over', 'neighboring', 'kingdom', 'where', 'capture', 'Princess', 'Tamina', 'Dastan', 'framed', 'father', 'murder', 'Tamina', 'desert', 'must', 'clear', 'name', 'Meanwhile', 'secrets', 'strange', 'dagger', 'can', 'alter', 'time.Filled', 'impressive', 'special', 'effects', 'fun', 'slightly', 'robotic', 'video', 'game-flavored', 'action', 'sequences', 'Prince', 'Persia', 'Sands', 'Time', 'semi-entertaining', 'poorly', 'paced', 'movie', 'opening', 'example', 'little', 'slow', 'middle', 'horribly', 'admit', 'secrets', 'started', 'unravel', 'plot', 'continued', 'became', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'became', 'more', 'invested', 'movie', 'biggest', 'highlight', 'was', 'when', 'bandits', 'showed', 'up', 'middle', 'movie', 'practically', 'irrelevant', 'plot', 'obviously', 'only', 'included', 'comic', 'relief', 'actually', 'started', 'make', 'things', 'interesting', 'got', 'excited', 'characters', 'was', 'nice', 'have', 'someone', 'else', 'screen', 'other', 'Dastan', 'Tamnia', 'once', 'got', 'past', 'initial', 'shock', 'film', 'slow', 'pace', 'was', 'able', 'enjoy', 'have', 'holes', 'Prince', 'Persia', 'acceptable', 'somewhat', 'fun', 'action', 'movie', '-at', 'least', 'once', 'get', 'horribly', 'boring', 'beginning/middle', 'go', 'just', 'enjoy', 'action', 'sequences', 'special', 'effects', 'fine', 'not', 'stellar', 'area', 'plot', 'character', 'know', 'Disney', 'really', 'Prince', 'Persia', 'be', 'next', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'just', 'not', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'will', 'spawn', 'movie', 'franchise', 'hope', 'unfortunate', 'reality', 'due', '200', 'million', '100', 'million', 'marketing', 'budget', 'flick', 'poor', 'box', 'office', 'numbers', 'thus', 'far', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'good']",Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time 2010 Gemma Arterton
1346298,A3DIS5O83SQJWW,B003IHUI0O,"Amazon Customer ""geekacres""","[2, 2]","Mirroring the same grand course that Disney charted in the Pirates of the Caribbean, Prince of Persia makes its mark right from the first minutes of the film.  When we first meet the Prince, he is cut from the same `street rat' cloth as Disney's Aladdin.  But much like that tumbling protagonist, the Prince quickly rises to royal status while not losing sight of where he came from.  Jake Gyllenhall brings a lot of heart and personality to Prince Dastan as he meets the princess Tamina and discovers the secrets of the dagger powered by the Sands of Time.Jerry Bruckheimer takes the audience straight into the action with vast sweeping deserts, majestic spired cities, and a soundtrack that should really be experienced in your home theater.  The energy is as kinetic as you might expect for a film based on a videogame.  Through a series of events Dastan and the dagger are pursued up the walls, across the rooftops, and through of the caves of this adventure.The supporting cast really brings the film to vibrant life.  Gemma Arterton is marvelous as the fiery princess Tamina who has been entrusted with the mystical secret of the dagger.  Ben Kingsley plays the Prince's uncle and is the polar opposite of his Ghandi character as he leads Dastan and his royal brothers on a very personal quest of his own.I've been a gamer for years, and have always been leery about taking characters from a console and transplanting them on the big screen.  Prior to seeing the film, I had not played any of the Prince of Persia games.

While this is a Disney product, it is NOT as light hearted or cartoonish as the Pirates of the Caribbean series. The violence and Foley effects (sound effects) of squishy stabbings are a bit too gruesome.The plot centers around three brothers, sons of a King of an ancient Persian Empire, who uncover sedition on their boarders, and invade a Holy City, which enrages their father the King. One son is the first-born heir, the other a military general, and the third a loveable rogue, who was adopted by the king for an act of bravery in his adolescence.The Holy city holds a mysterious secret, and a beautiful girl who guards it, and provides a wonderful McGuffin of button-button-who's-got-the button for the rest of the romp.The acting is fine, and there are characters by the dozens. Lots of elements are heavily borrowed from Raiders of the Lost Ark, and similar action adventure stories, but the plot never drags and the hero and heroine have an amusing friction as they fall in love through their trials.Sadly, Ben Kingsley's make-up makes him look odd, but it was delightful to see him and he does his usual excellent job. Jake shares his chiseled good looks and apparently does a lot of his own stunts, it was only afterwards that I learned the film is a derivative of a video game, but many of the intricate acrobatics make sense once you learn this.The movie is quite long, but doesn't really flag. Our 12-year-old daughter and my wife both enjoyed it, although you would have guesssed the film was pitched for teenage boys.Once again, be very cautious on the violence, this is not for the eyes of those in their tender years.Final word, we are a very conservative traditional Catholic family, so we are cautious about movies with to much ""magic"" in them and distortions of the supernatural. While there is a strong element essential to the plot that involves ""the [g]ods"" within the context of the film it makes sense and while I did discuss these elements with my children, they had the good sense to recognize the difference between the film's structure of fantasy and reality. But not every parent, particularly conservative Christian parents increasingly concerned about our continually coarsening world where the demonic is accepted as normal, would come to the same conclusion.

Since there is little in this movie to recommend it other than SX, they become its great weakness instead of its strength.The plot ... if you can call it that ... is paper thin and the characterizations are on par with the cartoons and video games that inspired the film. The acting is average, with Kingsley sleep walking through his role (what was he thinking????) and the others going through the paces with minimal effort, which is what the dialogue demanded of them.There are some WONDERFUL visual feasts; vast desert panoramas and other-worldly city-scapes. There is also a bit of comic relief that allows the picture to stop short (just barely) of taking itself too seriously. But there just was no emotional connection to the film. I know that sounds odd when I'm talking about this type of movie, but do you remember the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie? How you laughed at that, and really cared what happened to those characters? Did you laugh a lot at this? Were you in suspense about the outcome? Did you care what happened to these people?

Is a nice little movie that, could have been a much better summer movie that it was.I know what Disney was trying to do. It was trying for another Pirates of the Caribbean series success. Well it missed the mark entirely!For all his cuteness and sex appeal, in this instance Jake Gyllenhaal is no Johnny Depp. Depp was made to play the role of Capt. Jack Sparrow.Just as he was ideal for the role of Sweeny Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street!Gyllenhaal however could only mug and flex for the camera. He had no real sense of comic timing, which would've made his role much more enjoyable.The plot line wasn't well written either. There could have been a little more creativeness to it than just the ""Evil Uncle"" plot device.And finally, there's the fact that, not all video games make good movie adaptations. Case in point, the Street Fighter movie. The first movie was a near flop and the second was a flop!So I give the movie 4 stars. Only because it was a nice idea, that could have been better!

E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is entirely a sword fighting, adventure type fantasy film.I have to be honest though- the first 20 minutes led me to believe I was going to be entirely bored by one generic action segment after another, however this soon changed once we got acquainted with the actual characters.Plus all the side characters that seemed jammed together incoherently in the beginning eventually made sense once we discovered more about them.  At first I was afraid this wouldn't be the case and that I'd be spending all my time trying to figure out who's who.The storyline is pretty simple- a magical dagger has some time travelling abilities.  That's basically all there is to it.  Of course such a special weapon needs constant protection, which is how the adventure gets underway.Many of the action scenes are quite a spectacle to watch, such as one specific scene near the end where waves of sand appeared to be flowing downward all the way to a black hole, and the princess and prince had to grab ahold of something in order to save their lives.  It kind of messed with my head a little bit watching the whole event take place, and I mean that in a totally positive way- very unique special effects.There's also some fairly entertaining humor with ostrichs, snakes and chickens that come into play.  Mostly however, the storyline focuses on constant sword fighting.  It's a bit much, and I'm tempted to take away one star exactly because of the overabundance of it, but I won't.Overall, a nice piece of family entertainment.",5,fun for the whole family,1297468800,"02 12, 2011",2011,1547,"['Prince', 'Persia', 'Sands', 'Time', 'entirely', 'sword', 'fighting', 'adventure', 'type', 'fantasy', 'film.I', 'have', 'be', 'honest', 'though-', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'led', 'believe', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'entirely', 'bored', 'one', 'generic', 'action', 'segment', 'however', 'soon', 'changed', 'once', 'got', 'acquainted', 'actual', 'characters.Plus', 'side', 'characters', 'seemed', 'jammed', 'together', 'incoherently', 'beginning', 'eventually', 'made', 'sense', 'discovered', 'more', 'first', 'was', 'afraid', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'case', ""'d"", 'be', 'spending', 'time', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'who.The', 'storyline', 'pretty', 'simple-', 'magical', 'dagger', 'time', 'travelling', 'abilities', 'basically', 'course', 'such', 'special', 'weapon', 'needs', 'constant', 'protection', 'how', 'adventure', 'underway.Many', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'quite', 'spectacle', 'watch', 'such', 'one', 'specific', 'scene', 'end', 'where', 'waves', 'sand', 'appeared', 'be', 'flowing', 'downward', 'way', 'black', 'hole', 'princess', 'prince', 'had', 'grab', 'ahold', 'something', 'order', 'save', 'lives', 'kind', 'messed', 'head', 'little', 'bit', 'watching', 'whole', 'event', 'take', 'place', 'mean', 'totally', 'positive', 'way-', 'very', 'unique', 'special', 'effects.There', 'also', 'fairly', 'entertaining', 'humor', 'ostrichs', 'snakes', 'chickens', 'come', 'play', 'Mostly', 'however', 'storyline', 'constant', 'sword', 'fighting', 'bit', 'much', ""'m"", 'tempted', 'take', 'away', 'one', 'star', 'exactly', 'overabundance', ""won't.Overall"", 'nice', 'piece', 'family', 'entertainment']",Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time 2010 Gemma Arterton

Given, you can't take Jake Gylenhaal seriously, but he does well playing The Prince. (Think Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow) While I don't want to fully compare this to many films, it still has elements from many great films. Obviously, it's got an Aladdin feel to it, (An orphan boy who is taken in by royalty, and not that bad with parkour, who meets a beautiful princess. (Who is played by Gemma Arterton, best known for her roles as Agent Fields in Quantum of Solace and Io in Clash of the Titans). It's also somewhat like any number of films about finding ancient artifacts (National Treasure, Indiana Jones).This is a somewhat predictable film, if you just think of every movie you've seen, you can most likely see the ending by about 40 minutes into the film. That being said, this is not a movie to be passed by. Jake and Gemma are great at acting, Alfred Molina, (Who was Dr. Octopus in Spider-Man 2) plays the comic relief Sheik.) And Ben Kingsley plays the Uncle of the Princes. All are great actors/actresses.************SPOILER WARNING****************The main starter is that Dastan is a young 10ish aged orphan who stops another boy from getting beaten by guards. Then he jumps over rooftops, and does other crazy parkour stuff, just to be caught by the guards. Just before being executed he is rescued by the King of Persia himself. The King takes Dastan in as one of his own sons and so he becomes a Prince of Persia. That's the first 10 minutes or so.**********END SPOILER WARNING*************So all in all this is a genuine 3-4 star movie, one to be put on your summer movie list. I loved the film, so did everyone I saw it with. This may not be one to pay over $10 a pop, but the Matinee showtimes are a great way to go for this film. Great acting, but some of the parkour scenes are a little funny as they film it in a Matrix-like way with them moving at slow speed. A great film all the way, though not one to be taken seriously, just go to the theater in a state of mind of this being a fun, but not too crazy or serious film and you should like it. There are one or two scenes that might be scary to kids, like a guy getting burned by something and people trying to save him, and some action scenes that are a little crazy. Some may find it scary, but I don't know if this warranted a PG-13 rating, well, it may have just barely stepped over that line.",4,Better Than It's Given Credit For,1275177600,"05 30, 2010",2010,2446,"['was', 'fun', 'movie', 'what', 'critics', 'say', 'was', 'very', 'fun', 'movie', 'Given', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'Jake', 'Gylenhaal', 'seriously', 'well', 'playing', 'Prince', 'Think', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Jack', 'Sparrow', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'fully', 'compare', 'many', 'films', 'still', 'elements', 'many', 'great', 'films', 'Obviously', 'got', 'Aladdin', 'feel', 'orphan', 'boy', 'who', 'taken', 'royalty', 'not', 'bad', 'parkour', 'who', 'beautiful', 'princess', 'Who', 'played', 'Gemma', 'Arterton', 'best', 'known', 'roles', 'Agent', 'Fields', 'Quantum', 'Solace', 'Io', 'Clash', 'Titans', 'also', 'somewhat', 'number', 'films', 'finding', 'ancient', 'artifacts', 'National', 'Treasure', 'Indiana', 'Jones', '.This', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'film', 'just', 'think', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'can', 'most', 'likely', 'see', 'ending', '40', 'minutes', 'film', 'being', 'said', 'not', 'movie', 'be', 'passed', 'Jake', 'Gemma', 'are', 'great', 'acting', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'Who', 'was', 'Dr.', 'Octopus', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'comic', 'relief', 'Sheik', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Uncle', 'Princes', 'are', 'great', 'actors/actresses', '************SPOILER', 'WARNING****************The', 'main', 'starter', 'Dastan', 'young', '10ish', 'aged', 'orphan', 'who', 'stops', 'boy', 'getting', 'beaten', 'guards', 'Then', 'rooftops', 'other', 'crazy', 'parkour', 'stuff', 'just', 'be', 'caught', 'guards', 'Just', 'being', 'executed', 'rescued', 'King', 'Persia', 'King', 'Dastan', 'one', 'own', 'sons', 'so', 'Prince', 'Persia', 'first', '10', 'minutes', 'so', '**********END', 'SPOILER', 'WARNING*************So', 'genuine', '3-4', 'star', 'movie', 'one', 'be', 'put', 'summer', 'movie', 'list', 'loved', 'film', 'so', 'did', 'everyone', 'saw', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'one', 'pay', '10', 'pop', 'Matinee', 'showtimes', 'are', 'great', 'way', 'go', 'film', 'Great', 'acting', 'parkour', 'scenes', 'are', 'little', 'funny', 'film', 'Matrix-like', 'way', 'moving', 'slow', 'speed', 'great', 'film', 'way', 'not', 'one', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'just', 'go', 'theater', 'state', 'mind', 'being', 'fun', 'not', 'too', 'crazy', 'serious', 'film', 'should', 'like', 'are', 'one', 'two', 'scenes', 'might', 'be', 'scary', 'kids', 'guy', 'getting', 'burned', 'something', 'people', 'trying', 'save', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'little', 'crazy', 'may', 'find', 'scary', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'warranted', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'well', 'may', 'have', 'just', 'barely', 'stepped', 'line']",Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time 2010 Gemma Arterton

(Going forward I will call him JG)Granted JG's a great actor, ""Brokeback Mountain"", ""Jarhead"", ""Zodiac"".JG's one of the most underrated and underappreciated actors in Hollywood.But JG as The Prince of Persia???I had my doubts.The only actor I knew in the movie was Ben Kingsley, so I knew HE would at least add a touch of class and excellence to the movie and he does.Now....I wasn't expecting this movie to be a masterpiece and it wasn't...not by a long shot.But for a video game to film translation...this movie is probably the best of the bunch.Anyone who's seen any of the game to movie translations will probably agree with me that thanks to Uwe Boll the majority of these movies have been simply horrid.Thankfully ""Prince"" does not suffer the same fate.As for JG playing the Prince.There is one scene where I really went...OMG he DOES look just like the Prince.Not the Prince from ""Sands of Time"" but the grizzly one from the second game ""The Warrior Within"".The hair, the beard, the outfit, he's a dead ringer except for his big eyes kind of ruin the effect.Ok but besides that what is good?The script is excellent.The acting is top notch and for a movie like this is almost unheard of.The FX are of course simply the best you could hope for but the film hardly relies on FX and instead uses them to compliment the story.All the Prince's moves are accounted for. The platforming, the wall runs, etc... without looking fake or corny.The sand rewind was just as I expected it to be, awesome.What was bad?Parts of it were corny and hokey.The ostrich races and that whole gang of comic relief characters could have been cut out of the film entirely.The film itself is WAY too long.At almost two hours I literally had to force myself from falling asleep during the middle part of the movie.A half hour could have been trimmed easily and nothing would have been lost.In fact a movie like this almost has to move at a breakneck pace to match the subject matter.But it didn't.Those minor points aside I'll sum up ""Prince of Persia"" like this.Excellent story.Excellent acting.Not so good pacing.Great FX.Recommended?If you have the patience for two hours and are as big a fan of the video games as I am, then yes.The rest of you may want to wait.Me?I thought it was a great popcorn movie and I look forward to the next one.Recommended.",4,A good start to a new franchise.,1281484800,"08 11, 2010",2010,2653,"['lot', 'people', 'have', 'been', 'playing', 'Prince', 'Persia', 'video', 'games', 'Sands', 'Time', 'came', 'out', 'Ninetendo', 'Gamecube', 'way', 'back', 'when.I', 'fell', 'love', 'game', 'franchise', 'when', 'heard', 'were', 'doing', 'live', 'action', 'film', 'first', 'impression', 'was', 'WHY', 'Then', 'heard', 'cast', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Going', 'forward', 'will', 'call', 'JG', 'Granted', 'JG', 'great', 'actor', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'Jarhead', 'Zodiac', '.JG', 'one', 'most', 'underrated', 'underappreciated', 'actors', 'Hollywood.But', 'JG', 'Prince', 'Persia', 'had', 'doubts.The', 'only', 'actor', 'knew', 'movie', 'was', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'knew', 'HE', 'would', 'least', 'add', 'touch', 'class', 'excellence', 'movie', 'does.Now', '.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'movie', 'be', 'masterpiece', 'was', ""n't"", 'not', 'long', 'shot.But', 'video', 'game', 'film', 'translation', 'movie', 'probably', 'best', 'bunch.Anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'game', 'movie', 'translations', 'will', 'probably', 'agree', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'majority', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'simply', 'horrid.Thankfully', 'Prince', 'not', 'suffer', 'same', 'fate.As', 'JG', 'playing', 'Prince.There', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'really', 'went', 'DOES', 'look', 'just', 'Prince.Not', 'Prince', 'Sands', 'Time', 'grizzly', 'one', 'second', 'game', 'Warrior', 'Within', '.The', 'hair', 'beard', 'outfit', 'dead', 'ringer', 'big', 'eyes', 'kind', 'ruin', 'effect.Ok', 'what', 'good', 'script', 'excellent.The', 'acting', 'top', 'notch', 'movie', 'almost', 'unheard', 'of.The', 'FX', 'are', 'course', 'simply', 'best', 'could', 'hope', 'film', 'hardly', 'FX', 'instead', 'compliment', 'story.All', 'Prince', 'moves', 'are', 'accounted', 'platforming', 'wall', 'etc', 'looking', 'fake', 'corny.The', 'sand', 'rewind', 'was', 'just', 'expected', 'be', 'was', 'bad', 'Parts', 'were', 'corny', 'hokey.The', 'ostrich', 'races', 'whole', 'gang', 'comic', 'relief', 'characters', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'film', 'entirely.The', 'film', 'WAY', 'too', 'almost', 'two', 'hours', 'literally', 'had', 'force', 'falling', 'asleep', 'middle', 'part', 'movie.A', 'half', 'hour', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'trimmed', 'easily', 'nothing', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lost.In', 'fact', 'movie', 'almost', 'move', 'breakneck', 'pace', 'match', 'subject', ""didn't.Those"", 'minor', 'points', 'aside', ""'ll"", 'sum', 'up', 'Prince', 'Persia', 'this.Excellent', 'story.Excellent', 'acting.Not', 'so', 'good', 'pacing.Great', 'FX.Recommended', 'have', 'patience', 'two', 'hours', 'are', 'big', 'fan', 'video', 'games', 'am', 'then', 'rest', 'may', 'want', 'wait.Me', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'popcorn', 'movie', 'look', 'forward', 'next', 'one.Recommended']",Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time 2010 Gemma Arterton

It gives away too much of the plot.Now then: I don't hold out much hope for movies based on video games (or films involving Sir Ben Kingsley because of the many flops he's been in during the last decade+), but Prince of Persia (PoP) genuinely surprised me with its depth of characters, fantastic costume design, and entertainment value. I found myself totally immersed in the fiction and loved every moment of this film.For non-gamers, there's no need to know anything about the games this film is based on. I played the first PoP as a middle school student (20 years ago.. yikes!) and barely remember the basic plot. All you need to know is that this is a fantasy action-adventure set in ancient Persia. It is about love (between a father and his sons, the bond between brothers, and the love of a man and a woman), loyalty, courage, friendship, and betrayal. This kind of story has been done many times, but it's done very well here by Disney, producer Jerry Bruckheimer, and director Mike Newell (Donnie Brasco,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire).It's a ""sword and sandals"" epic: fantastic costumes, lots of sword fights, horses, men in armor, a beautiful princess, and a mystical dagger. For the guys, there's the lovely Gemma Arterton, who plays the same kind of character/love interest as inClash of the Titans. She is never difficult to look at. And for the ladies, a beefy Jake Gyllenhaal plays Prince Dastan, the adopted son of the King of Persia, a noble, wise, and just ruler. Dastan is later framed for the murder of his father and spends most of the movie running from his pursuers while trying to restore a sacred artifact to its rightful resting place. Along the way, he meets an cadre of unlikely friends. Though minor characters, they are very well-written and provide some of the film's best moments. I especially liked the gregarious sheikh, played by Alfred Molina (Dr. Octopus fromSpider-Man 2) and his M'baka companion.The sets, CG, and costume are all lavishly detailed and superbly designed. Everything looks wonderfully ancient and historically appropriate. The main characters all speak with British accents (and are British actors) though they're supposed to be Persian, but it works! Dastan has some really slick combat choreography. Parts of the film look like another video game, the more recentAssassin's Creedgames, both because of the ancient Persian setting and the rooftop acrobatics. Add some super-duper bad-a** assassins and you've got good times here.A light-hearted and fun movie, this is what summer is all about, with absolutely no WTF moments for me to complain about. Highly recommended.",5,A surprisingly good time! ** SPOILER FREE REVIEW **,1283212800,"08 31, 2010",2010,2689,"['begin', 'DO', 'NOT', 'READ', 'AMAZON', 'MOVIE', 'DESCRIPTION', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'plot.Now', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'out', 'much', 'hope', 'movies', 'based', 'video', 'games', 'films', 'involving', 'Sir', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'many', 'flops', 'been', 'last', 'decade+', 'Prince', 'Persia', 'PoP', 'genuinely', 'surprised', 'depth', 'characters', 'fantastic', 'costume', 'design', 'entertainment', 'value', 'found', 'totally', 'immersed', 'fiction', 'loved', 'moment', 'film.For', 'non-gamers', 'need', 'know', 'anything', 'games', 'film', 'based', 'played', 'first', 'PoP', 'middle', 'school', 'student', '20', 'years', 'ago..', 'yikes', 'barely', 'remember', 'basic', 'plot', 'need', 'know', 'fantasy', 'action-adventure', 'set', 'ancient', 'Persia', 'love', 'father', 'sons', 'bond', 'brothers', 'love', 'man', 'woman', 'loyalty', 'courage', 'friendship', 'betrayal', 'kind', 'story', 'been', 'done', 'many', 'times', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'here', 'Disney', 'producer', 'Jerry', 'Bruckheimer', 'director', 'Mike', 'Newell', 'Donnie', 'Brasco', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Goblet', 'Fire', '.It', 'sword', 'sandals', 'epic', 'fantastic', 'costumes', 'lots', 'sword', 'fights', 'horses', 'men', 'armor', 'beautiful', 'princess', 'mystical', 'dagger', 'guys', 'lovely', 'Gemma', 'Arterton', 'who', 'same', 'kind', 'character/love', 'interest', 'inClash', 'Titans', 'never', 'difficult', 'look', 'ladies', 'beefy', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Prince', 'Dastan', 'adopted', 'son', 'King', 'Persia', 'noble', 'wise', 'just', 'ruler', 'Dastan', 'later', 'framed', 'murder', 'father', 'most', 'movie', 'running', 'pursuers', 'trying', 'restore', 'sacred', 'artifact', 'rightful', 'resting', 'place', 'way', 'cadre', 'unlikely', 'friends', 'minor', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'well-written', 'provide', 'film', 'best', 'moments', 'especially', 'liked', 'gregarious', 'sheikh', 'played', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'Dr.', 'Octopus', 'fromSpider-Man', '2', ""M'baka"", 'companion.The', 'sets', 'CG', 'costume', 'are', 'lavishly', 'detailed', 'superbly', 'designed', 'Everything', 'wonderfully', 'ancient', 'historically', 'appropriate', 'main', 'characters', 'speak', 'British', 'accents', 'are', 'British', 'actors', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'be', 'Persian', 'Dastan', 'really', 'slick', 'combat', 'choreography', 'Parts', 'film', 'look', 'video', 'game', 'more', 'recentAssassin', 'Creedgames', 'ancient', 'Persian', 'setting', 'rooftop', 'acrobatics', 'Add', 'super-duper', 'bad-a**', 'assassins', ""'ve"", 'got', 'good', 'times', 'here.A', 'light-hearted', 'fun', 'movie', 'what', 'summer', 'absolutely', 'WTF', 'moments', 'complain', 'Highly', 'recommended']",Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time 2010 Gemma Arterton

And that's unfair, because this is a pretty entertaining film that keeps you glued to the screen all the way. It has action, romance, humor, and, in the era of special effects, plenty of them.The story begins in the city of Nasaf, when King Sharaman (Ronald Pickup), impressed by the streets smarts of a homeless kid by the name of Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal), adopts him to become part of the royal family. All is well for many years, until it is revealed that the neighboring and friendly, holy city of Alamut is selling weapons to the enemy. The king's sons - Tus (Richard Coyle), Garsiv (Toby Kebbell) and Dastan --, together with their uncle Nizam (Ben Kingsley), decide to conduct a preemptive strike against Alamut, try to find the weapons, and bring stability to the region. The King, who knew better, was against the invasion, but accepted his family's explanation and supported them. Unfortunately, an accident happens, in which the king dies, and Dastan is blamed for it. He has to escape and run for his life, in order that he can prove his innocence. He is joined by beautiful Queen Tamina (Gemma Arterton), ruler of Alamut, in the quest for the truth. But the truth is bigger that anything Dastan could imagine, and the answer lies on a sacred dagger that the queen carries with her.Based on a video game with the same name, and directed by Mike Newell, ""Prince of Persia - The Sands of Time,"" is fun, especially in the scenes involving Sheik Amar (the very versatile Alfred Molina, who steals the film). Of course, you should also expect all the excesses associated with Jerry Bruckheimer, who produced the movie. In the end, you will surely understand when they say, at the beginning of the film, that, ""It is said some lies are linked across time, connected by an ancient calling that echoes through ages."" Furthermore, this business about invading another country because of non-existent weapons sounds familiar, doesn't it? Great idea for many more movies.

1346323,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B003IHUI0O,C. B Collins Jr.,"[1, 1]","This film is a visual feast of action and special effects. Jake Gyllenhaal, playing the lead role as Prince Dastan, does a good job of moving into role of dashing and handsome action hero.  Gemma Arterton, one of the most beautiful women on earth, plays Princess Tamina.  Both actors are able to convey the over the top acting style necessary to compete with the exceptional effects. This is not an art film that requires subtle understated acting but rather requires robust over-statement to balance the incredible visual effects.  Don't take this as criticism. If you want a subtle Gyllenhaal, watch Brokeback Mountain. If you want an action hero Gyllenhaal, this is the film for you. The art direction was superb with construction of an ancient empire, Persia, with all its grandeur. The cinematography was also superb with visual effects in virtually every frame of the film. The beautiful North African landscape of Morocco evoked a visual time and place for the viewer.  The film requires the viewer to suspend judgment and to forget any knowledge they have of Persia, Islam, Sufism, and Zorasterism; since in this film there is great literary license taken around the cultures that make up the Persian Empire (ancient Iran). The Prince of Persia delivers visually stunning entertainment with incredible editing to keep your eyes and mind engaged at all times. The storyline is not especially complicated but that is never a problem since the action and visuals are certainly the primary focus.  Ben Kingsley is the only character that doesn't need to overstate their performance. As the younger brother to the King, he is the primary character that the audience must try to figure out as does Prince Dastan. The incredible acting skills of Alfred Molina are evident in the role of Sheik Amar and I think Molina could have stolen the show if this character had been more developed.  Steve Toussaint, an incredible physical force, as the African slave Seso, has a wonderful fight scene with the Hassansins, a group trained to specialize in assassinations. Toby Kebbell and Richard Coyle play the two biological princes and adopted brother to Prince Dastan. Both do a great job.

1346324,A2CVP31XTYSZFE,B003IHUI0O,"Celia Hayes ""Sgt. Mom""","[6, 6]","As a movie based on a popular game, I would have to say that  taken strictly at face value, Prince of Persia - Sands of Time is not half-bad as a movie. It's notThe Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition)- but neither is itBattlefield Earth; just an agreeable middle of the road fantasy spectacular. This may be the key thing about movies based on games: gripping situation, fairly interesting characters, a very, very well-visualized world  . . .  and a paint-by-the-numbers plot. Not to say that Prince of Persia is badly or incompetently plotted, just that any plot which would have rung changes on the same set of characters within the world of ancient Persia created for it would have done just as well - and will probably serve equally well in a sequel. Or two, or three, since the whole thing with the glass-handled dagger brings the story around again to the beginning, with nothing changed, just like starting another round of the game. Otherwise, it's lovely eye-candy, on several levels. As a bonus, it offers some agreeably amusing supporting characters, most especially Alfred Molina who now owns the franchise on comic villainy. There is also a rather nice rapport between the hero and the feisty princess-priestess, Jake Gyllanhaal and Gemma Arterton, and supporting acting talent more than equal to the materiel - although seeing Ben Kingsley in what at first appeared to be a minor role was a dead giveaway in the first five minutes that his character was up to something villainous.

1346326,AB34G6VKP28L,B003IHUI0O,"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic""","[0, 0]","There's nothing I love more than a big-budget blockbuster. I did not go in expecting much and when I came out, had decided Prince of Persia is worthy of the legacy Disney's last epic-scale franchise, Pirates of the Caribbean, left behind.Orphaned and left to fend for himself, young Dastan never realized when he risked his life for another child that he would draw the attention of royalty, but when King Sharaman witnesses the boy's courage and fortitude, it is decided that Dastan will be raised as his own along with his sons. Fifteen years later, the royal princes are formidable in warfare and fond of one another. The eldest (Richard Coyle) is in training to become the future king of Persia, while his dutiful uncle Nizam (Ben Kingsley) guides his responses and assists him in making wise decisions. When it becomes known that one of their holy cities is supplying their enemies with weapons, it is decided that the city must be taken by force -- a feat that proves successful but not without cost. In defeating an adversary, Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal) comes into possession of a fine dagger with a glass hilt. What he does not realize is this special dagger will give him the power to turn back time... and that it is worth killing for.One of the guardians of the magical dagger is Princess Tamina (Gemma Arterton), who becomes a fugitive along with Dastan when something unthinkable happens. Soon they are running from their lives with a ransom on their heads -- and the full force of the dagger has yet to be revealed. While this script is inspired by a popular video game, and the movie does play homage to the game in various fun and smart ways, it can stand alone as a decent piece of cinematic material. Most adaptations cannot claim that much -- this has a first-rate plot, some fun twists and turns, and enough adventure to satisfy even the most ADD audience. I can count on one hand the number of times an audience has applauded at the end of a film, and this is one of them. It's a romantic, dangerous, mystical adventure into a fantasy version of history, complete with gorgeous costumes and a solid cast. Gyllenhaal and Arterton have great chemistry and their romance does not feel rushed or forced, since it starts off on the wrong foot, continues into constant arguments, and then at the end begins to soften.Many of the escape methods and fighting techniques are straight out of the game -- leaping rooftops, sliding around on ropes, dangling from wooden pegs halfway up sheer walls, climbing with the assistance of arrows embedded into stone. There are a few modern jokes thrown in for the audience's enjoyment (one man Dastan runs into evades Persian taxes by spreading lies about the notorious thieves in a particular valley, whereas there is nothing more terrifying than ostrich races going on) and problematic material is kept to a minimum. If you're fond of the fantasy genre or were not concerned with the supernatural aspect in the Pirates films, this is no more pervasive and in some ways, less sinister since it doesn't involve the walking dead. It surprised me with the fact that it was simply fun to watch -- it doesn't require much emotional involvement but still manages to include a few wonderful moments and they were careful to keep the action scenes from becoming too repetitive. Overall, it's one of the more enjoyable experiences I have had in the cinema.",4,most fun I've had in a long time!,1332892800,"03 28, 2012",2012,3397,"['nothing', 'love', 'more', 'big-budget', 'blockbuster', 'did', 'not', 'go', 'expecting', 'much', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'had', 'decided', 'Prince', 'Persia', 'worthy', 'legacy', 'Disney', 'last', 'epic-scale', 'franchise', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'left', 'behind.Orphaned', 'left', 'fend', 'young', 'Dastan', 'never', 'realized', 'when', 'risked', 'life', 'child', 'would', 'draw', 'attention', 'royalty', 'when', 'King', 'Sharaman', 'boy', 'courage', 'fortitude', 'decided', 'Dastan', 'will', 'be', 'raised', 'own', 'along', 'sons', 'Fifteen', 'years', 'later', 'royal', 'princes', 'are', 'formidable', 'warfare', 'fond', 'one', 'eldest', 'Richard', 'Coyle', 'training', 'become', 'future', 'king', 'Persia', 'dutiful', 'uncle', 'Nizam', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'responses', 'making', 'wise', 'decisions', 'When', 'known', 'one', 'holy', 'cities', 'supplying', 'enemies', 'weapons', 'decided', 'city', 'must', 'be', 'taken', 'force', 'feat', 'successful', 'not', 'cost', 'defeating', 'adversary', 'Dastan', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'possession', 'fine', 'dagger', 'glass', 'hilt', 'What', 'not', 'realize', 'special', 'dagger', 'will', 'give', 'power', 'turn', 'back', 'time', 'worth', 'killing', 'for.One', 'guardians', 'magical', 'dagger', 'Princess', 'Tamina', 'Gemma', 'Arterton', 'who', 'fugitive', 'Dastan', 'when', 'something', 'unthinkable', 'happens', 'Soon', 'are', 'running', 'lives', 'ransom', 'heads', 'full', 'force', 'dagger', 'yet', 'be', 'revealed', 'script', 'inspired', 'popular', 'video', 'game', 'movie', 'play', 'homage', 'game', 'various', 'fun', 'smart', 'ways', 'can', 'stand', 'alone', 'decent', 'piece', 'cinematic', 'material', 'Most', 'adaptations', 'can', 'not', 'claim', 'much', 'first-rate', 'plot', 'fun', 'twists', 'turns', 'enough', 'adventure', 'satisfy', 'even', 'most', 'ADD', 'audience', 'can', 'count', 'one', 'hand', 'number', 'times', 'audience', 'applauded', 'end', 'film', 'one', 'romantic', 'dangerous', 'mystical', 'adventure', 'fantasy', 'version', 'history', 'complete', 'gorgeous', 'costumes', 'solid', 'cast', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Arterton', 'have', 'great', 'chemistry', 'romance', 'not', 'feel', 'rushed', 'forced', 'wrong', 'foot', 'constant', 'arguments', 'then', 'end', 'soften.Many', 'escape', 'methods', 'fighting', 'techniques', 'are', 'straight', 'game', 'leaping', 'rooftops', 'sliding', 'around', 'ropes', 'dangling', 'wooden', 'pegs', 'halfway', 'up', 'sheer', 'walls', 'climbing', 'assistance', 'arrows', 'embedded', 'stone', 'are', 'few', 'modern', 'jokes', 'thrown', 'audience', 'enjoyment', 'one', 'man', 'Dastan', 'evades', 'Persian', 'taxes', 'spreading', 'lies', 'notorious', 'thieves', 'particular', 'valley', 'nothing', 'more', 'terrifying', 'ostrich', 'races', 'going', 'problematic', 'material', 'kept', 'minimum', ""'re"", 'fond', 'fantasy', 'genre', 'were', 'not', 'concerned', 'supernatural', 'aspect', 'Pirates', 'films', 'more', 'pervasive', 'ways', 'less', 'sinister', ""n't"", 'involve', 'walking', 'dead', 'surprised', 'fact', 'was', 'simply', 'fun', 'watch', ""n't"", 'require', 'much', 'emotional', 'involvement', 'still', 'include', 'few', 'wonderful', 'moments', 'were', 'careful', 'keep', 'action', 'scenes', 'becoming', 'too', 'repetitive', 'Overall', 'one', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'experiences', 'have', 'had', 'cinema']",Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time 2010 Gemma Arterton

What happened with the movie Ishtar is sort of what happened here with PRINCE OF PERSIA. Sure, the movies are two completely different things. ISHTAR was a comedy set in the desert and people didn't get it. It was long and boring. PRINCE OF PERSIA had a better shot at success because it was based on a video game, which are FUN and FAST and EXCITING.  PRINCE OF PERSIA has moments of FUN, but it is never fast or even close to being EXCITING.PRINCE OF PERSIA was stunning in the sense that a video game movie that had so much potential, became a talk fest DRAMA before you realize what happened. The movie starts off with much promise. In fact, early on, I was involved and thinking that I thought the movie had been misjudged and that it wasn't that bad.  Then the drama started and the action disappeared like a gust of sand in the wind.Before I realized it, I was disconnected from the film that had become a long series of talking heads and soap opera drama. I was reading. Playing on the internet. Doing dishes. Thinking about what movie I could watch next that would guarantee me the intense involvement that I was hoping to get with PRINCE OF PERSIA.... and didn't.The creators of PRINCE OF PERSIA dropped the ball. The screenplay was lacking flair and creativity, which is consequently the exact opposite of what you get with the ground-breaking highly creative video game.For all intensive purposes, I should give the movie 1 star, but I reserve 1's for real stinkers and 5's for real gems.

1346329,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B003IHUI0O,Chris Pandolfi,"[7, 8]","""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"" is an exceedingly simply story told amidst a wealth of complicated stunt work and impressive special effects, which is basically a fancy way of saying that it's thin on premise but an absolute pleasure to look at. That doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie, although it does prevent me from appreciating it as anything more than an action spectacle - exempting a few weak references to recent political events, which I'm sure the intended family audiences will not pick up on. To be fair, it is based on a video game, and video games generally don't go above and beyond the razzle-dazzle of their graphics or the cool maneuvers players use for the characters. And I admit that, as video game adaptations go, it's quite entertaining. A bit derivative perhaps, and certainly slow in gaining momentum, but in the end, it's still entertaining.The setting is a fantastical representation of the sixth century Persian Empire, where vast stretches of desert separate kingdoms of flat rooftops and ornate palaces towering sky high. The protagonist is Prince Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal), drawn from elements of every Arabian archetype from Abu the Thief to Aladdin to Sinbad to Ali Baba; he was an orphaned street urchin before being adopted by King Sharaman (Ronald Pickup), who was impressed by his display of courage in the face of certain death. After fifteen years of loyalty and bravery, Dastan is framed by his wicked uncle Nizam (Ben Kingsley) for an exceptionally heinous crime, forcing him to make an acrobatic escape from the city. You know the kind of escape I'm talking about; it involves impossible stunts and a generous donation from the special effects department.Why was Dastan framed? Here enters Princess Tamina (Gemma Arterton), whose peaceful kingdom was invaded by Sharaman's army on the belief that dangerous weapons were being concealed for sinister purposes. (Do I sense a connection to the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the fruitless search for WMDs?) Tamina is the keeper of the film's MacGuffin: The Dagger of Time, an ancient knife with magical sand swirling in its glass hilt. If the jewel atop the dagger is pressed, the person holding it has the power to travel back a full minute in time, which is apparently just long enough for key characters to reverse fateful decisions and change the course of history. Were such a thing real, I'd probably have lots of fun with it.But for Tamina, it's serious business. The sand in the hilt is linked to a massive underground crystal that, if cracked open, could unleash a destructive force the likes of which no one has ever experienced. It's up to Tamina and Dastan to return the dagger to its rightful place, restore peace between their respective kingdoms, and stop Nizam before he has the chance to alter the past.Perhaps it's the mystical nature of the dagger that gives me pause, especially in relation to the underground crystal with which it's linked. This dagger, shiny and exotic, manipulates time under rules that seemed straightforward enough until they were obscured by events near the end of the film, events that shock us into believing they were clever when it fact they were merely the result of a narrative copout. Something within me is intrinsically resistant to stories involving time travel, for they can be anything at any time with no regard for structure, sequence, or even basic applications of logic. What we get from the end of ""Prince of Persia"" is not the tying of loose ends so much as an exercise in trickery, which is to say that, given what had gone on before, it cheats.Perhaps I have reservations about the characters, who are decent enough within the context of the story but are hardly memorable in the grand scheme of things. That could have more to do with the actors. Gyllenhaal, despite being ripped and in command of a convincing British accent, plays Dastan so generically that the role could have been given to any leading male. Arterton is certainly beautiful, although it takes her too long to develop Tamina into anything worthwhile; for the first forty-five minutes of the film, I found her incredibly annoying, always with the smart aleck dialogue. And then there's Alfred Molina as the obligatory yet distracting comedy relief - a money-grubber who created an isolationist community to avoid paying taxes. Who knew Objectivism stretched all the way back to the sixth century?Seriously though, what does all this amount to? Like so many summer popcorn flicks that have come before it, it amounts to a superficial but enjoyable experience at the movies. While ""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"" lacks any real importance, it does hold its own as a showcase of visual delights, so yes, I'm going to recommend it for sheer cinematic escapism. You want CGI? You've got CGI. You want stunts? You've got stunts. You want Jake Gyllenhaal? You've got Jake Gyllenhaal. Perhaps it was too much to hope for a masterpiece, although I do find myself thinking of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" which proved that supernatural artifacts, exotic locations, heroes, villains, and plenty of action all in the same movie can be both preposterous and brilliant. I have reservations, but I can't deny that I liked what I saw.",4,O Happy Dagger!

1346330,AN9J46667D80O,B003IHUI0O,"Chris Swanson ""I'm just this guy, you know?""","[3, 4]","Ah, lovely Persia, circa something BC. A land of graceful minarets, beautiful landscapes and a dagger that controls the fate of humanity. Yes, kids, it's time of year again: time for the summer popcorn action movies!This particular one is an adaptation of the popular video game series, Prince of Persia. Now I've not played it, and haven't any real desire to start (I'm still trying to finish Assassin's Creed II), but if this movie is anything to go by it looks like it's probably fairly decent.The film centers around an orphan boy, Dastan (played as an adult by Jake Gyllenhaal, a man who has never been introduced to a close shave). He gets adopted by the king of what appears to be an alternate history version of Persia. I'll have to write an article on my blog that goes into more detail on that and my guesses on how such a timeline came about. No life, you see. Anyhow, Dastan goes to the palace and gets raised by the king along with his two new brothers. Also present is the king's brother, played by Ben Kingsley in a role so telegraphed he might as well have had ""I'm a scheming vizier!"" tattooed onto his forehead.Anyhow, the good prince gets caught up in an invasion of a holy city that appears to be at least somewhat Jewish in its holiness, but not quite. More on this later. Suffice to say that the invasion (staged on the pretext of finding weapons factories, as I roll my eyes), is a success, more or less, though in the after party the king is killed, Dastan is framed for his death, goes on the run with a princess/priestess from the city and is now carrying a magical dagger that can turn back time in 30 second intervals.From there he goes on a nice travelogue of places that are apparently right near the city all the action has been happening in. He meets a man who races ostriches (played with manic glee by Alfred Molina), his knife-throwing Sudanese henchman, several assassins and, of course, develops an attraction to the woman he's on the run with (we know in advance this will happen because she clearly hates him on first sight).The plot is pretty basic, predictable and paint-by-numbers but somewhat to my surprise I didn't hate it. I liked this movie, actually, quite a bit more than I'd expected that I would. Its action scenes are decent, the dialogue is humorous when it needs to be, everyone involved seemed to be having a good time and it had a nice level of energy, though it did drag a bit in the second and third acts.Overall if you want basic escapism, this is a good movie to escape with. It's hardly great cinema, but it doesn't need to be, really. It is what it is and what it is is pretty decent.",4,A fine popcorn film!,1275350400,"06 1, 2010",2010,2646,"['Ah', 'lovely', 'Persia', 'circa', 'something', 'BC', 'land', 'graceful', 'minarets', 'beautiful', 'landscapes', 'dagger', 'fate', 'humanity', 'Yes', 'kids', 'time', 'year', 'again', 'time', 'summer', 'popcorn', 'action', 'movies', 'particular', 'one', 'adaptation', 'popular', 'video', 'game', 'series', 'Prince', 'Persia', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'not', 'played', 'have', ""n't"", 'real', 'desire', 'start', ""'m"", 'still', 'trying', 'finish', 'Assassin', 'Creed', 'II', 'movie', 'anything', 'go', 'probably', 'fairly', 'decent.The', 'film', 'centers', 'orphan', 'boy', 'Dastan', 'played', 'adult', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'man', 'who', 'never', 'been', 'introduced', 'close', 'shave', 'adopted', 'king', 'what', 'be', 'alternate', 'history', 'version', 'Persia', ""'ll"", 'have', 'write', 'article', 'blog', 'more', 'detail', 'guesses', 'how', 'such', 'timeline', 'came', 'about', 'life', 'see', 'Anyhow', 'Dastan', 'palace', 'raised', 'king', 'two', 'new', 'brothers', 'Also', 'present', 'king', 'brother', 'played', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'role', 'so', 'telegraphed', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'had', ""'m"", 'scheming', 'vizier', 'tattooed', 'forehead.Anyhow', 'good', 'prince', 'caught', 'up', 'invasion', 'holy', 'city', 'be', 'least', 'somewhat', 'Jewish', 'holiness', 'not', 'quite', 'More', 'later', 'Suffice', 'say', 'invasion', 'staged', 'pretext', 'finding', 'weapons', 'factories', 'roll', 'eyes', 'success', 'more', 'less', 'party', 'king', 'killed', 'Dastan', 'framed', 'death', 'run', 'princess/priestess', 'city', 'now', 'carrying', 'magical', 'dagger', 'can', 'turn', 'back', 'time', '30', 'second', 'intervals.From', 'nice', 'travelogue', 'places', 'are', 'apparently', 'right', 'city', 'action', 'been', 'happening', 'man', 'who', 'ostriches', 'played', 'manic', 'glee', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'knife-throwing', 'Sudanese', 'henchman', 'several', 'assassins', 'course', 'attraction', 'woman', 'run', 'know', 'advance', 'will', 'happen', 'clearly', 'first', 'sight', '.The', 'plot', 'pretty', 'basic', 'predictable', 'paint-by-numbers', 'somewhat', 'surprise', 'did', ""n't"", 'hate', 'liked', 'movie', 'actually', 'quite', 'bit', 'more', ""'d"", 'expected', 'would', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'decent', 'dialogue', 'humorous', 'when', 'be', 'everyone', 'involved', 'seemed', 'be', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'had', 'nice', 'level', 'energy', 'did', 'drag', 'bit', 'second', 'third', 'acts.Overall', 'want', 'basic', 'escapism', 'good', 'movie', 'escape', 'hardly', 'great', 'cinema', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'really', 'what', 'what', 'pretty', 'decent']",Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time 2010 Gemma Arterton

This movie is filled with exciting action scenes, within a very intricate, complex, and suspenseful story.  It's rare to find a movie these days with such a well-constructed story.  I'm impressed with the balance between plot development and relationship development.  The movie is also really satisfying in that the villain is so formidable.  Many stories' villains have evident weaknesses, even comical elements, but Prince of Persia's is really severe.  It also succeeds at originality, avoiding cliches and imitations of other adventure stories.  And it has enjoyable, clever banter between Prince Dastan (the main character) and Princess Tamina.  The violence depicted is not graphic or gratuitous, which I appreciate.  It is the suddenness and unexpectedness of the violence, rather than gore, which give it its power.

While a lot of it was computer generated imagery, these effects were still quite spectacular! The music was great too, a little reminiscent of Pirates of the Caribbean, but powerful enough to move the story.The story was simple enough; Orphan adopted by the King becomes a prince and conquers another kingdom, captures a mysterious princess and finds a powerful weapon, the Dagger of Time. He then is framed for regicide, and flees with the Princess. They run into a gamblers' camp and cause more mischief. The Prince learns the dagger unlocks the sands of time which can rewind time and if misused will unleash armageddon. After watching those he cares about die one by one, and teaming up with the gamblers, the Prince stops the plot that started with his framing and would have ended in the destruction of the world.There are a lot of acrobatic chase scenes and swashbuckling fight scenes throughout, and the landscape and views of fictional Persian cities are breath-taking. The parts in between can seem a little dull in comparison, but serve the purpose of building the story and relationship between the Prince and Princess.Overall, this movie was just a lot of fun to watch over and over again!

But trailers for films based on video games had been misleading in the past and it's safe to say that while every one of those films isn't flat out terrible, they were all pretty disappointing and weren't nearly as good as their source material. At this point though, it looks like Walt Disney Pictures has released the most satisfying video game film adaptation to date.Jake Gyllenhaal was certainly a pleasant surprise as street beggar turned prince character known as Dastan. He was pretty much the last person on everyone's mind to fill the wall running shoes of the prince in this film, but he managed to get into the shape of his career, film some incredible action sequences, and be witty and charming at the same time. Ben Kingsley and Alfred Molina have great supporting roles, as well. Sheik Amar (Molina) shines because of his character's underhandedness and Nizam (Kingsley) has a smarminess to him that truly shines when his plans begin to crumble. Gemma Arterton was the only one who didn't really seem to deliver. Other than her role being rather similar to her role in Clash of the Titans, she's dull and generally shows no emotion at all the majority of the time other than looking like she'll burst into tears at any given moment.The film was certainly able to accomplish capturing the look and feel of the video games. Other than the incredible locations where the film was shot getting the credit for that, the special effects deserve to be mentioned, as well. The vast cities, menacing sandstorms, and sands of time spectacles are pulled off because of the spectacular CGI and they don't disappoint. Other than a few minor instances, the special effects could arguably be the best part of the film.Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time delivers an extraordinarily entertaining action adventure that contains enough material from the video games to satisfy fans while including a relatively talented cast and jaw dropping special effects.

Wend,"[6, 8]","I have no experience with the video game The Prince of Persia but having seen the trailers for the film, week after week, I was interested in seeing the film.  I like tales set in mythic times so The Prince of Persia had an appeal, which was completely fulfilled by the film.I have revealed some of the story, below, so those who have not seen the movie might want to skip the next two paragraphs.The story centers on Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal), a boy of the streets, who is adopted by the king of Persia for his bravery and coming to assist those in need.  The king already has two sons, Tus and Garsiv, and his adoption of Dastan comes from a prophecy.  Dastan grows up to be a clever warrior and a voice of reason for his older brothers.  The story revolves around that taking of the Holy City of Alamut.  Dastan is against storming the city until evidence is presented that the inhabitants are forging weapons that will be used against the Persians by other enemies.  Ben Kingsley plays the king's brother who presents a mask of the perfect advisor to his nephews.  The city is captured and Dastan comes into possession of the true reason the city was captured: a dagger that hold inside it magical sand that can reverse time.  The dagger is guarded by a princess named Tamina (played by Gemma Arterton) who contrives to steal the dagger.The king of Persia arrives at the Alamut, and is poisoned from a gift given to him by Dastan.  Dastan must flee and prove his innocence.  Along the way, is a humorous encounter with an ostrich racing, tax-evading sheik played by Alfred Molina.  Dastan and the princess trade the dagger back and forth, and are pursued by sinister assassins.I was unsure if Jake Gyllenhaal would make an effective action-romantic hero, but he does a magnificent job with the role. He has good on screen chemistry with Gemma Arterton. The production is sumptuous and the costume designers produced some stunning costumes. Several reviewers have said the dialogue was tiresome and the editing choppy but I did not find that to be the case.

And in 2010, Walt Disney Pictures, courtesy of producer Jerry Bruckheimer (""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films, ""Black Hawk Down"", ""Bad Boys"" films, ""National Treasure"" films, ""Armageddon"") and director Mike Newell (""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"", ""Donnie Brasco"", ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"") along with screenwriters Boaz Yakin, Doug Miro and Carlo Bernard went to work on the film adaptation, cinematographer John Seale (""Poseidon"", ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"", ""The Perfect Storm"", ""The Talented Mr. Ripley) and Harry Gregson-Williams (""Shrek Forever After"", ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"", ""The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3') composing the music for the film.If anything, the filmmakers odds were against them as video game to film have not really had much success.  And for ""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"", the film received mixed  reviews from the critics but at the same time, this CG-driven film budgeted around $150-200 million made around $329 million in the worldwide box office and is expected to make more in home video sales.VIDEO:""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"" looks absolutely fantastic.  Presented in 1080p (2:40:1), the film looks absolutely stunning.  You can see the detail on the surface of the clothing, the wood, the stubble on Gylenhaal's chin, skin pigmentation and more.  Colors are absolutely vibrant with orange, amber hues that are seen in the film and the wonderful CG work when Dastan uses his dagger.  Blacks are nice and deep, detail is just magnificent.  There are scenes that uses a weak light source, ala candlelight so there is some black crush present as detail are not as pronounced on scenes with very dark shadows but by no means does this hurt the picture quality of the entire film.I didn't notice any artifacting, banding, combing, aliasing, anything negative.  If anything, this is one of the best PQ live-action films to come from Disney.  Very impressive!As for the accompanying DVD, the film is presented in 480i (Widescreen 2:40:1 - Enhanced for 169 televisions).AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (48 kHz/24-bit).  The lossless audio of this film is absolutely fantastic.  The dialogue and music is crisp and clear and what is more impressive is the use of sound.  From the arrows zipping and panning from right to left and a scene where a man is using a steel whip against Dastan and you hear that whip swirling all over the soundscape.  Fantastic use of immersive sound.  And because of the many action scenes, great use of LFE for the bigger sounds throughout the film.  Also, included is an English 2.0 DVS, French 5.1 DTS and French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital soundtrack.  Fans of the film will enjoy this lossless soundtrack!As for the accompanying DVD, the DVD comes with an English, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital soundtrack and an English 2.0 DVS.Subtitles are presented in English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"" comes with the following special features (in 1080p HD and in English 5.1 Dolby Digital):* An Unseen World: Making Prince of Persia - (15:52) NOTE: This is stand-alone on the accompanying DVD  or the BD single release.

So, I think that given the success of the film, we will more than likely see a ""Prince of Persia"" sequel.In some ways, having played and still purchasing many incarnations of the video game, it was one thing to expect the main character to jump on walls and buildings.  I wasn't expecting a labyrinth or floors breaking apart and our hero would fall to his death like the video game but I was expecting a more meatier adventure-based story between Dastan and the princess.  In some way, almost an exciting adventure story similar to an earlier ""Indiana Jones"" style of film.  To get away from the typical video game film mindset of popcorn action flick but a film with more substance than glitz and beauty.Afterall, you have a talented director, cinematographer and composer, you expect an action-driven film but a good story.  But in many ways, ""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"" follows the list of debased films in which they look great (and look and sound spectacular on Blu-ray) but if anything, it's not a film that stands out in your mind, nor do you feel inclined in wanting to watch it again (unless you are a Jake Gyllenhaal or Gemma Arterton die-hard fan).The performances were fine but Ben Kingsley, I've seen him act with a tremendous amount of passion in films before and in ""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"", I felt he was a bit subdued as Nizam.  Gemma Arterton was very good, sexy, beautiful as the Princess Tamina and definitely a major 180 from the character of her ""St. Trinity's"" films.  She's an actress that can take on any kind of character and it shows  And also you have a good number of talents with Alfred Molina, Richard Cole, Ronald Pickup, Toby Kebbell and Steve Toussaint doing a good job as well.But as for the main actor, Jake Gyllenhaal, there was no doubt we would see the well-known actor taking on an action-based role and showing off his athletic nature (and physique) throughout the film but similar to Ben Kingsley, we have seen these two talents really shine in non-action films, in this case...the character of Dastan had the flair of the action silent star Douglas Fairbanks but at the same time, the storyline of Fairbanks film made you enjoy the film even more, in this case...everything seems like a blur as our protagonist is all over the place.  Yes, it's true to the video game...jumping, fighting, climbing, etc. but I would have enjoyed more time focused on character development.""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"" is definitely a Blu-ray that shines in the video and audio category.  The picture quality is fantastic and the lossless audio was very impressive.  Special features were OK, but I prefer to watch special features independently, not selecting them while watching a film.  So, I'm not the biggest fan of Disney's ""CineExplore"" but it's all subjective to the viewer.For those who do not want the DVD and digital copy but only the Blu-ray, a Blu-ray single disc release of ""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"" will be sold separately as well.Overall, ""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"" does show it's faithfulness to the video game franchise.  There is plenty of action in this film and for the most part, it is a good popcorn action flick, but for those wanting something deeper, you're not going to find it in this film.  But if you want a fun, action-driven film, nothing more and nothing less, ""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"" is definitely for you.",4,"Blu-ray: ""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"" is very

1346347,A3GHBLTVJLRPAH,B003IHUI0O,Derek,"[1, 1]","If you're in the mood for non-stop action and adventure and little in the way of character development and plot, then this is your movie.Now, giving credit where it's due, they did try to make a sensible and well-developed film. The characters had interesting stories and the actors did well, but it just didn't come together in the end.The film follows an adopted prince of Persia as he and his brothers conquer a holy city and take possession of a magical, time-altering dagger. After being blamed for the murder of his stepfather, the prince must discover the true murderer before his angered brothers have him killed.Being that this movie was based off of a video game and that the script for the film was conceived by the video game-series writer, it played out very much like a video game would. There are some cheesy lines, some obvious statements and redundancies, and it all went on a little longer than it should. The point of the film (as was with the games) was to be drawn in to the action and see some pretty cool things while doing it. The action scenes were well played and enjoyable to watch, and the special effects were stunning. You can tell that this film had a lot of the crew from the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise; it just had such a similar feeling to it.Now, let us jump deeper into the technicalities of the film. Number one, Jake Gyllenhaal. The guy is a good actor, no fight there. But he is not an action star, nor is he a convincing Persian prince. He just does not look the part. While he did a decent job, I just think it was a poor casting decision. I had a hard time watching him play a part that just was not him. Number two, the princess was a bit of an annoyance. Yes, I understand that if you pull someone out of their environment and place them in an opposite one, they will react in an odd and uncharacteristic way. But, being that this princess supposedly was wise beyond her years and lived through some very enlightening and mind-boggling moments in her young life, you think that she would have kept her head on a little straighter when she left her kingdom. She traversed between a winy little girl and a teenager attempting to be smart a little too often and it was unconvincing and annoying. You expected more from her; or at least hoped for more. And maybe it was just me, but did any one else see Sheik Amar as a Jack Sparrow rip-off? Just me?The ending was interesting, somewhat bold, but interesting. That's all I'll say there. But overall, the movie was fun too watch - a little too long - but entertaining to say the least.[...]",2,Fun but too long,1326499200,"01 14, 2012",2012,2587,"[""'re"", 'mood', 'non-stop', 'action', 'adventure', 'little', 'way', 'character', 'development', 'plot', 'then', 'movie.Now', 'giving', 'credit', 'where', 'due', 'did', 'try', 'make', 'sensible', 'well-developed', 'film', 'characters', 'had', 'interesting', 'stories', 'actors', 'did', 'well', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'together', 'end.The', 'film', 'adopted', 'prince', 'Persia', 'brothers', 'conquer', 'holy', 'city', 'take', 'possession', 'magical', 'time-altering', 'dagger', 'being', 'blamed', 'murder', 'stepfather', 'prince', 'must', 'discover', 'true', 'murderer', 'angered', 'brothers', 'have', 'killed.Being', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'video', 'game', 'script', 'film', 'was', 'conceived', 'video', 'game-series', 'writer', 'played', 'out', 'very', 'much', 'video', 'game', 'would', 'are', 'cheesy', 'lines', 'obvious', 'statements', 'redundancies', 'went', 'little', 'longer', 'should', 'point', 'film', 'was', 'games', 'was', 'be', 'drawn', 'action', 'see', 'pretty', 'cool', 'things', 'doing', 'action', 'scenes', 'were', 'well', 'played', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'stunning', 'can', 'tell', 'film', 'had', 'lot', 'crew', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'franchise', 'just', 'had', 'such', 'similar', 'feeling', 'it.Now', 'let', 'jump', 'deeper', 'technicalities', 'film', 'Number', 'one', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'guy', 'good', 'actor', 'fight', 'there', 'not', 'action', 'star', 'convincing', 'Persian', 'prince', 'just', 'not', 'look', 'part', 'did', 'decent', 'job', 'just', 'think', 'was', 'poor', 'casting', 'decision', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'watching', 'play', 'part', 'just', 'was', 'not', 'Number', 'two', 'princess', 'was', 'bit', 'annoyance', 'Yes', 'understand', 'pull', 'someone', 'environment', 'place', 'opposite', 'one', 'will', 'react', 'odd', 'uncharacteristic', 'way', 'being', 'princess', 'supposedly', 'was', 'wise', 'years', 'lived', 'very', 'enlightening', 'mind-boggling', 'moments', 'young', 'life', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'kept', 'head', 'little', 'straighter', 'when', 'left', 'kingdom', 'traversed', 'winy', 'little', 'girl', 'teenager', 'attempting', 'be', 'smart', 'little', 'too', 'often', 'was', 'unconvincing', 'annoying', 'expected', 'more', 'least', 'hoped', 'more', 'maybe', 'was', 'just', 'did', 'one', 'else', 'see', 'Sheik', 'Amar', 'Jack', 'Sparrow', 'rip-off', 'Just', 'ending', 'was', 'interesting', 'somewhat', 'bold', 'interesting', ""'ll"", 'say', 'there', 'overall', 'movie', 'was', 'fun', 'too', 'watch', 'little', 'too', 'long', 'entertaining', 'say', 'least.', '[', ']']",Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time 2010 Gemma Arterton

1346349,A11C43I615R52G,B003IHUI0O,"Don Vito Corleone ""The Joker""","[0, 0]","First of all let me tell you this: This is Not Pirates of the Caribbean, so for the ones who like (or like me love) the pirates trilogy you better start lowering your expectations when you walk into this film.When I heard about Prince of Persia I did not pay too much attention to it. It did not interest me the way pirates did so when I went to see it I did not expect anything spectacular. Well, let me tell you that I was reasonably satisfied throughout the film.Like any Bruckheimer film, Prince of Persia offers a spectacular scenery with tons of elaborate action sequences, elaborate costumes, elaborate makeup, elaborate chase scenes and elaborate special effects. The locations are fantastic and you can see the amount of work the crew had to do in order to achieve this epic. The plot is interesting enough to keep you entertained and the cast acts reasonably okay. I was surprised that I was enyojing the film more than I expected and overall it is a good summer film. The score by Harry Gregson-Williams really adds to what you are seeing in the screen.Now, the bad stuff. Though the plot is interesting, some lack in the script prevents the film to achieve new heights. This is no help when you have one-note characters in the entire film. When I said the cast acted reasonably fine, is because I think that the actors did the best with characters that can't be worked too much. So if you were expecting another Jack Sparrow, well, don't expect too much. Dastan is your typical hero with typical hero problems and typical hero quests. I think Jake Gyllenhaal did a fair job with the character but he is not Johnny Depp and Dastan is not Jack Sparrow. Other lacking characters were Princess Tamina and Nizam (the villain). The first is played by Gemma Arterton who I think was the low point in terms of acting. The latter is played by the great Ben Kingsley who unfortunately does not have enough material to work with. Don't expect villains like Barbossa or Davy Jones because Nizam is your typical villain without any charm. The high point was Alfred Molina as a dishonest trader who was at the same time comic relief and the best character in the film.Overall, with this minor problems, I was enjoying the film until we reached the end. It was utterly disappointing making the whole plot of the film to not have any sense. I won't spoil anything but let me tell you that the end was the reason I graded the film 3 stars instead of four.

1346352,A8B3WBWEI3TVG,B003IHUI0O,"E. Ambrose ""Fellshot""","[1, 5]","It should surprise no one that the Prince of Persia: the Sands of Time isn't what one would call cinematic genius. It has a few things going against it. First, it is based off of a video game. It is well chronicled that no movie based off of a video game ever gets beyond ""fun"" (and perhaps ""witty"")  with its storyline. More often then not the standard reaction is ""I just wasted two hours that I could have spent contemplating the universe."" Second, I start to worry when movies seem so effects driven. I want story. The Prince of Persia manages to more or less wreck its story impact at the end, but keeps a certain level of humor that had me grinning every time I facepalmed.The writing is so-so, as I mentioned before. It certainly wasn't the worst movie I've seen this year, but the plot was pretty predictable. An orphan is adopted by the king, king's relatives start power grabbing and blame everything on the adopted son. Adopted son tries to clear name and save everyone. Wash, rinse, repeat. Do not use bleach. I can't say that there was all that much to the performances by the main characters except that they were all right, but nothing spectacular. The banter between Dastan and Tamina tended towards the mildly witty, but away from the clever repartee I found the dialog mildly pompous. It wasn't awful, it just seemed a bit stuffy in places. The bad guy was pretty standard and decently acted, but nothing particularly spectacular. I did like that the brothers were unwittingly aiding the big conspiracy against the throne.And then there's the ending. I loathe any variation of ""it was only a dream"" when ending any kind of story. I think it's a lazy cop out that effectively invalidates the narrative and waters down any point that the storyteller was trying to make. I would be considerably more intrigued with this film if it didn't go back to a saved game at the end. The sad end would have worked with the story and the conclusion could have been so much more philosophical than the ""happily ever after"" they used.There are some saving moments to this movie. Sheik Amar was funny every step of the way. I loved his jokes about taxes and how he was unabashedly a conniving clown. I liked the ostrich races too. The first few rewind scenes with the dagger are also pretty funny.I'd wait for the rental, but it's well worth the effort to sit around with some friends and throw popcorn at.

1346356,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B003IHUI0O,Ed Uyeshima,"[3, 7]","The sight of Jake Gyllenhaal in a defiantly heroic pose with his imposing dagger on the poster of this 2010 fantasy adventure would seem to portend a film filled with self-parody, but alas, the actor takes the Aladdin-like title role semi-seriously. He's actually better than expected in the over-the-top derring-do role, but the movie itself is absurdly convoluted and overly ridiculous, even by the standards of the 2003 video game which inspired this CGI-saturated production. It should come as no surprise that the executive producer is action-schlock master Jerry Bruckheimer, whose commercial track record extends fromBeverly Hills Copto theNational Treasurefranchise. What did surprise me is that the director is Mike Newell, better known for soft, female-oriented fare such asEnchanted AprilandFour Weddings and a Funeral. However, both he and Gyllenhaal give themselves almost entirely to Bruckheimer's more commercial, comic-book sensibilities.The fanciful plot takes place in the sixth century B.C. where we find a Persian street urchin named Dastan being adopted by King Sharaman for his courageous acrobatics in a crowded marketplace. He grows up with his loyal foster brothers Garsiv and Tus, the rightful heirs to the throne who lead the Persian army in an attack on the sacred city of Alamut. In a none-too-subtle allusion to current-day Iraq, the siege on Alamut comes from a wrongful assumption that the city's people are selling weapons to their enemies. Behind the assault is the King's brother and trusted advisor, the Dick Cheney-like Nizam. Elsewhere in the city, Dashan leads a swashbuckling rogue effort that leads him to the comely Princess Tamina who holds the secret behind the mythical Dagger of Time. The dagger has time-bending powers that allow the user to undo any mistake and redo any moment. In short order, Dashan gets framed for murder and escapes with Tamina and the dagger.All sorts of contrived shenanigans subsequently follow with the addition of Sheik Amar, an ostrich-racing thief who amusingly hates both taxes and the confining role of government, as the dagger elusively changes hands and a fatalistic sinkhole yields an ending that may remind you of Pam's unexpected discovery of Bobby in the shower onDallas. Aside from Gyllenhaal's muscular performance, Gemma Arterton (a memorable bit as Strawberry Fields inQuantum of Solace) makes a fetching princess with plenty of predictable moxy. As Nizam, Ben Kingsley is not nearly as embarrassing here as he was inThe Love Guru, but his Oscar will continue collecting dust by itself with his string of disappointing movie choices. The ethnically versatile Alfred Molina steals the film in an act of petty larceny as the comical sheik. With so many special effects coming at the viewer uninterrupted, it was extremely difficult to find a core of humanity in this whole venture. But that's Bruckheimer's objective after all - to overwhelm your senses until you turn into the exact same pulp he chooses to present to all the fanboys and fangirls who will flock to this paper-thin extravaganza.",3,"Bruckheimer and CGI Effects Dominate a Paper-Thin, Fleet-Footed Video Game-Derived Epic",1275436800,"06 2, 2010",2010,3082,"['sight', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'defiantly', 'heroic', 'pose', 'imposing', 'dagger', 'poster', '2010', 'fantasy', 'adventure', 'would', 'seem', 'portend', 'film', 'filled', 'self-parody', 'alas', 'actor', 'Aladdin-like', 'title', 'role', 'semi-seriously', 'actually', 'better', 'expected', 'over-the-top', 'derring-do', 'role', 'movie', 'absurdly', 'convoluted', 'overly', 'ridiculous', 'even', 'standards', '2003', 'video', 'game', 'inspired', 'CGI-saturated', 'production', 'should', 'come', 'surprise', 'executive', 'producer', 'action-schlock', 'master', 'Jerry', 'Bruckheimer', 'commercial', 'track', 'record', 'fromBeverly', 'Hills', 'Copto', 'theNational', 'Treasurefranchise', 'What', 'did', 'surprise', 'director', 'Mike', 'Newell', 'better', 'known', 'soft', 'female-oriented', 'fare', 'such', 'asEnchanted', 'AprilandFour', 'Weddings', 'Funeral', 'However', 'Gyllenhaal', 'give', 'almost', 'entirely', 'Bruckheimer', 'more', 'commercial', 'comic-book', 'sensibilities.The', 'fanciful', 'plot', 'place', 'sixth', 'century', 'B.C', 'where', 'find', 'Persian', 'street', 'urchin', 'named', 'Dastan', 'being', 'adopted', 'King', 'Sharaman', 'courageous', 'acrobatics', 'crowded', 'marketplace', 'up', 'loyal', 'foster', 'brothers', 'Garsiv', 'Tus', 'rightful', 'heirs', 'throne', 'who', 'lead', 'Persian', 'army', 'attack', 'sacred', 'city', 'Alamut', 'none-too-subtle', 'allusion', 'current-day', 'Iraq', 'siege', 'Alamut', 'wrongful', 'assumption', 'city', 'people', 'are', 'selling', 'weapons', 'enemies', 'assault', 'King', 'brother', 'trusted', 'advisor', 'Dick', 'Cheney-like', 'Nizam', 'Elsewhere', 'city', 'Dashan', 'swashbuckling', 'rogue', 'effort', 'comely', 'Princess', 'Tamina', 'who', 'secret', 'mythical', 'Dagger', 'Time', 'dagger', 'time-bending', 'powers', 'allow', 'user', 'undo', 'mistake', 'redo', 'moment', 'short', 'order', 'Dashan', 'framed', 'murder', 'escapes', 'Tamina', 'dagger.All', 'sorts', 'contrived', 'shenanigans', 'subsequently', 'follow', 'addition', 'Sheik', 'Amar', 'ostrich-racing', 'thief', 'who', 'amusingly', 'taxes', 'confining', 'role', 'government', 'dagger', 'elusively', 'hands', 'fatalistic', 'sinkhole', 'yields', 'ending', 'may', 'remind', 'Pam', 'unexpected', 'discovery', 'Bobby', 'shower', 'onDallas', 'Aside', 'Gyllenhaal', 'muscular', 'performance', 'Gemma', 'Arterton', 'memorable', 'bit', 'Strawberry', 'Fields', 'inQuantum', 'Solace', 'fetching', 'princess', 'plenty', 'predictable', 'moxy', 'Nizam', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'not', 'nearly', 'embarrassing', 'here', 'was', 'inThe', 'Love', 'Guru', 'Oscar', 'will', 'continue', 'collecting', 'dust', 'string', 'disappointing', 'movie', 'choices', 'ethnically', 'versatile', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'film', 'act', 'petty', 'larceny', 'comical', 'sheik', 'so', 'many', 'special', 'effects', 'coming', 'viewer', 'uninterrupted', 'was', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'find', 'core', 'humanity', 'whole', 'venture', 'Bruckheimer', 'objective', 'overwhelm', 'senses', 'turn', 'exact', 'same', 'pulp', 'present', 'fanboys', 'fangirls', 'who', 'will', 'flock', 'paper-thin', 'extravaganza']",Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time 2010 Gemma Arterton

Here, in PRINCE OF PERSIA: THE SANDS OF TIME, he looked so damned fine I didn't care what quality the film was (or that it was based on a video game or that Jake resembles Jared Leto in ALEXANDER).Yet old Jake surprised me: his delightful, flawless British accent (that is a mystery I cannot solve, why he had it in the first place), his acting, his comic timing...a joy! A JOY! This kid has been studying acting deeply.The story here is not bad either. Though set in a silly Persia that I, as an anthropologist, can't recognize, and set in a time I cannot identify, it's fun. Fun, fun, fun. That's all one needs with a film like this...it isn't an exercise in logic for heaven's sake.Prince Dastan (JG), a street orphan adopted by Sharaman, King of Persia (Ronald Pickup) is raised in a loving (though inexplicably motherless) royal family. He and his two adopted brothers have adventures while they learn about leadership. They are aided by their Uncle Nizam (a villainous but excellent Sir Ben Kingsley), who is the prime aide-de-camp to the king.All this revolves around a magic time-travel dagger and ""the sands of time""...which I am not even going to try to synopsize for you. This film is so refreshing and exhilarating that you need to see it for yourself.A couple of other gems to watch for:1. The hilarious yet believable leader of the desert rogues, Sheikh Amar (Alfred Molina), and his abiding hatred for taxes and love affair with ostriches.2. The beautiful Princess Amina (German-born Gemma Arterton, who incidentally has six fingers on each hand)--WOW.3. The wicked, nameless leader of the Hashashin (here called ""Hassansin""), played by the handsome and charismatic Icelandic-born, Norwegian-raised actor G&iacute;sli &Ouml;rn Gararsson. He is not to be trifled with...or missed.4. The fighting, action, Jake's fabulous tumbling and jumping...man, I live for that kind of stuff when done correctly.5. A good tight story--I saw no gaps in logic such as Roger Ebert complained of seeing. It all fit perfectly but if you blink you will miss important details. This in the end is a morality play.6. The way everyone acted their hearts out, yet avoided scene-chewing. Director Mike Newell knows how to wring good performances from actors, I know that much.Now for the ugly:1. Though flawless, WHY does Jake have to have an accent other than his own? At certain moments he reminded me of Johnny Depp in all the wrong ways.2. What is up with all the sound dubbing (a/k/a looping)? Every other scene the characters have had to dub over the true sound and it gets annoying. One cannot get used to it. Especially when you get to hear true sound and the great acting-in-dialogue.3. There is no 3! Get this great, fun film, though it has its usual touches of violence unsuitable for kiddies.

One is the Bluray DVD only and one is the Bluray, DVD and digital copy. It is not worth the extra $$ to buy the 3pack unless you are dead set on having your digital copy.The special features were definately not worth the money spent. Also, the special feature on the Bluray has the Rewind/Fast Forward disabled so you HAVE to watch the whole thing from start to finish. If you miss something, you have to start back from start and cannot FFWD. They are also very limited as stated in the product description. You HAVE to have both the Bluray and the DVD to see all the extras and there are only 3 to see.If you are a fan of the Assassin's Creed game and the amazing views from rooftops, this movie quickly takes advantage of this photography style and I felt that they sort of ""stole"" from Assassin's Creed.The plot: Wasn't bad. It was a story of family betrayal and brotherly faith. It showed that the main character could have ruled by the way he is able to gain and manage followers from different lifestyles.

1346369,A328S9RN3U5M68,B003IHUI0O,Grady Harp,"[5, 5]","Video games. Since when did the art of film neglect fine screenplays, theatrical works, novels, and short stories as resources for cinema and settle for making kids' games movie material?  It makes a statement about priorities, right? But given the fact that pure video game entertainment is that important (having never played, this viewer is at a disadvantage), PRINCE OF PERSIA is a surprisingly sound film produced with extravagance and vigor and a wealth of CGI effects, and whatever happens with the little machine held gismo for the video game manipulation to make the experience exciting, that experience has been very well transformed by writers Boaz Yakin, Doug Miro, Carlo Bernard, and game inventor/screen story creator Jordan Mechner.  Disney joins Jerry Bruckheimer (with the fine help of director Mike Newell) in creating what should have been a resounding success at the box office extravaganza.  But alas, this one fizzled.  Why that happened is not apparent from the DVD.Jake Gyllenhaal hits that happy medium as a daredevil Prince Dastan with just the right dose of derring-do stunts, charisma, and finely tuned comedy timing: he makes a great hero on screen, but the costumers should have allowed him to feature his well-developed physique he worked on for this role.  But he makes the little orphan boy turned royal family believable and lovable. His adopted father, the king of Persia (Ronald Pickup), his 'brothers' (Toby Kebbell and Richard Coyle), his sidekick Bis (Reece Ritchie - keep an eye on this actor), and his evil uncle (Ben Kingsley) all contribute solid roles with quite a bit of philosophy about family ties and loyalty.  The key to the story is the siege of a borderline rival kingdom ruled by the smart and sassy Rachel Weisz-type Tamina (Gemma Arterton) who guards the dagger that has the ability to manipulate time.  Throw in a group of evil Hassasins (like that play on terms?) lead by G&iacute;sli &Ouml;rn Gararsson, some nearly unconquerable situations such as the world becoming a quicksand disaster, some wildly hilarious comedy (on the dark side) by tax evader Sheik Amar (Alfred Molina), and some changes that the time manipulating dagger can effect and the story spins to a conclusion. This viewer would be ready for a sequel, so entertaining is this diversion of a film, but the apparent box office failure of expectations make that an outside possibility.Though it is always difficult to tell where a Director of Photography and the CGI engineers meet, John Seale does provide some gorgeous desert effects.  The music by Henry Gregson-Williams is appropriate if forgettable.  Coming away from the DVD experience leaves this viewer even more impressed with the spectrum of acting skills of Jake Gyllenhaal.  And that is really enough.  The script makes some strange errors - beginning the film with statements as to how Persia was a vast country that covered the entire Middle East, and then throwing in references in the dialogue to Iraq, Turkey and other countries that makes the research sound shaky at best. It is a great popcorn movie - if popcorn at home weren't such a dietary no-no. Grady Harp, September 10",4,Video Games as Films?

Every installment of this sketch ended with the narrator saying, as the organ music dramatically paused, ""And...what about Naomi?""It was an inside joke. The real Naomi was Children's Television Workshop staffer Naomi Foner, who years later gave birth to the two young stars. What does this have to do with The Prince of Persia? Well, it gives Jake Gyllenhaal a few extra points with me even though this movie somehow falls short of what it could be. He seems like a sincerely good fellow, and even took the time to appear in promos and on talk shows to promote this film, something that some stars who cash huge Disney's paychecks don't bother to do.As a workout video, The Prince of Persia is better than any of those Jane Fonda VHS tapes. Jake earns his abs in scene after scene. It's a shame that the script did not offer him as much of a challenge. We never really get to know, or really care much about, the lead characters. The first 30 minutes is almost solid exposition, overloaded with political business and intrigue, before the fantasy of the magic dagger and the romance of the lovely and independent Princess and Dastan get underway.The two leads seem to have some chemistry but an awful lot of epic furniture gets in their way. I have to wonder how the script must have been before it was meddled with by all the chefs, concerned about the obviously huge budget paying off and making sure the kitchen sink wasn't left out.It's a fine cast with always great performances by Ben Kingsley and Alfred Molina, spectacular production values on a level with DeMille and a fine score by Harry Gregson-Williams.Maybe the summer was too hot here in Florida for me to find the film's setting very appealing. The short documentary included with the DVD (the Blu-Ray also includes a deleted scene and an interactive feature) tells us that the temperatures were over 100 degrees and this discomfort comes across in the film -- though apparently producer Jerry Bruckheimer stayed nice and cool in the studio where he taped his comments with a superimposed background behind him!",3,"It's okay, but what about Naomi?",1285027200,"09 21, 2010",2010,2435,"['Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'sister', 'Maggie', 'are', 'children', 'Naomi', 'What', 'Naomi', 'watched', 'classic', 'original', 'Electric', 'Company', 'back', ""'70s"", 'when', 'was', 'briefly', 'revived', 'DVD', 'know', 'was', 'signature', 'phrase', 'brilliant', 'Love', 'Chair', 'satire', 'soap', 'operas', 'was', 'conceived', 'head', 'writer', 'Paul', 'Dooley', 'Every', 'installment', 'sketch', 'ended', 'narrator', 'saying', 'organ', 'music', 'dramatically', 'paused', 'what', 'Naomi', 'was', 'inside', 'joke', 'real', 'Naomi', 'was', 'Children', 'Television', 'Workshop', 'staffer', 'Naomi', 'Foner', 'who', 'years', 'later', 'gave', 'birth', 'two', 'young', 'stars', 'What', 'have', 'do', 'Prince', 'Persia', 'Well', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'few', 'extra', 'points', 'even', 'movie', 'somehow', 'short', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'sincerely', 'good', 'fellow', 'even', 'took', 'time', 'appear', 'promos', 'talk', 'shows', 'promote', 'film', 'something', 'stars', 'who', 'cash', 'huge', 'Disney', 'paychecks', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'do.As', 'workout', 'video', 'Prince', 'Persia', 'better', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'Jake', 'abs', 'scene', 'scene', 'shame', 'script', 'did', 'not', 'offer', 'as', 'much', 'challenge', 'never', 'really', 'get', 'know', 'really', 'care', 'much', 'lead', 'characters', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'almost', 'solid', 'exposition', 'overloaded', 'political', 'business', 'intrigue', 'fantasy', 'magic', 'dagger', 'romance', 'lovely', 'independent', 'Princess', 'Dastan', 'get', 'underway.The', 'two', 'leads', 'seem', 'have', 'chemistry', 'awful', 'lot', 'epic', 'furniture', 'way', 'have', 'wonder', 'how', 'script', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'was', 'meddled', 'chefs', 'concerned', 'obviously', 'huge', 'budget', 'paying', 'off', 'making', 'sure', 'kitchen', 'sink', 'was', ""n't"", 'left', 'fine', 'cast', 'always', 'great', 'performances', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'spectacular', 'production', 'values', 'level', 'DeMille', 'fine', 'score', 'Harry', 'Gregson-Williams.Maybe', 'summer', 'was', 'too', 'hot', 'here', 'Florida', 'find', 'film', 'setting', 'very', 'appealing', 'short', 'documentary', 'included', 'DVD', 'Blu-Ray', 'also', 'deleted', 'scene', 'interactive', 'feature', 'temperatures', 'were', 'over', '100', 'degrees', 'discomfort', 'film', 'apparently', 'producer', 'Jerry', 'Bruckheimer', 'stayed', 'nice', 'cool', 'studio', 'where', 'taped', 'comments', 'superimposed', 'background']",Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time 2010 Gemma Arterton
1346371,A1SHNOU2ODKIDG,B003IHUI0O,Gregorio,"[0, 0]","The pre release photos and hype made this look like it was going to be a campy homoerotic muscle festival disguised as Disney's usual overblown, sugar coated, nausea inducing brain rot. Under the production leadership of Jerry Bruckheimer (who has dropped more bombs in the past year than George W. during his entire reign) and the knowledge that it was based on a video game, I was fairly certain I was going to stay far away from it.  Still . . . there was the intrigue of some very good actors such as Jake Gyllenhaal, Ben Kingsly and Alfred Molina.  And those previews looked interesting . . . sort of.  When I saw the blu ray disc at Walmart for half price I though I would give it a chance and I suppose it was worth half the retail price.It isn't ever going to be a great film but it is sometimes a very good looking one.  The set design here is amazing and there is some beautiful location photography.  Sadly there are also several scenes that look fairly bad due to obvious CGI compositing.  There are a few decent by the numbers action sequences that are also sort of fun.  The visual effects are nothing special, you've seen all of it before a thousand times.  There are some surprisingly fake looking CGI snakes in this thing too.  I'm talking SyFy channel low budget quickie stuff here.The actors are very good (as expected) with Ben Kingsley being a perfect villain.  Jake Gyllenhaal also proves that he can do just fine as a swashbuckling action hero.  Strangely all the work he did on his body to turn himself into an action hunk was mostly for nothing as his costumes keep him covered up through almost all of the film. All those muscle bound photos, posters and promotional clips don't represent what ended up on screen. I should think Gyllenhaal would be a little peeved about that. Jake also manages a passable British accent.  Did ancient Persians really speak with British accents?  Alfred Molina as a sheik gets what is probably the most memorable role in this curious film.  He also brings an occasional flash of much needed humor to this thing.The script is actually fairly interesting and thoughtful and has more going for it than this type of film usually does.  Mike Newell managed to direct his unweildy epic without making a fool of himself and for the most part the film stays under control without ever giving in to the temptation to stop the plot for a 20 minute action sequence.  Perhaps that is because this film actually has enough of a plot to sustain interest.  Sadly there are some truly atrocious editing choices made that, rather than enhance the experience of the film, take the viewer out of it and remind us that we are watching a movie.Disney did a good job with this blu ray release. Picture and sound quality are excellent, as you would expect from a film that was pretty much made for blu ray.  I bought the single disc edition rather than the 3 disc ""special"" edition because I have no use for a digital copy and didn't want a DVD.  The disc comes in a very nice looking embossed, holographic slipcase.  Really slick looking.  There is a well done documentary included on the disc called ""An Unseen World"" that gives some insight into production and costume design as well as interviews with the actors and crew.  Very standard stuff but it gave me all the info I wanted.  There is also a deleted scene included as well as seemingly endless advertisements promoting Disney blu rays.  When I put the disc in I was glad to see it had a quick loading time but then I braced myself for the onslaught of Disney propoganda that I knew was about to hit me.  MUCH TO MY SHOCK and PLEASURE, the screen displayed a message saying I could skip the ads by pressing the ""top menu"" button.  I did and I was immediately at the menu and watching the opening credits in about 15 seconds.  Thank you for that Disney. I truly didn't want to have to fast forward through trailers for Chihuahua movie sequels or listen to you tell me how my family and I should be watching television.Yes Disney, I still hate you simply because your films are atrocious, mind breakingly awful, conformist dreck and your relentless promotion of EVERY nonsensical film you peddle as ""Disney's latest masterpiece"" or ""Instant Classic""became laughable in 1980.  Nevertheless you proved that ""family"" entertainment does not have to be dumbed down to the point of idiocy with PRINCE OF PERSIA.  Of course, this film stunk up the box office like a rotting abscessunder Donald Duck's tail feathers so I'm sure you will fall right back into HANNAH MONTANNA DOES DALLAS: THE DISNEY 3D EXPERIENCE (coming to a theatre near me in the very near future).

Hire writers whose life experiences are derived from the explorations of Beverly Hills H.S. hallways and parking lots interspersed with a few non-creative BHHS creative-writing classes.

1346375,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B003IHUI0O,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 3]","I haven't played the video game, so I'm down only with the bare bones of the story. What I do know is that PRINCE OF PERSIA works as a sweeping fantasy adventure, and I couldn't peel away my eyeballs off the screen. This picture rivals THE MUMMY and THE PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN franchises in terms of the lavish scope and fantastical derring-do and that nostalgic callback to those pulp serial films. I basically enjoyed the crap out of it. Never mind that these Persians tend to speak with Brit accents, and that there isn't really a Persian (Iranian) actor who garners a noticeable part. It's cool. I'm shallow.The hero is Dastan, the gutsy orphan boy from the streets of Nasaf who gets adopted into the Persian royal family, but the meat of the story happens fifteen years later. The MacGuffin of the thing is a mystical dagger which can reverse time for the span of one minute (or less). When the Persian army invades the Holy City of Alamut - on suspicion that Alamut is amassing secret weapons - Dastan stumbles onto the dagger and so gains the attention of Alamut's beautiful, wily Princess Tamina (Gemma Arterton). Tamina is the last in a long line of guardians to the dagger. Her sacred vow to the gods would go a ways into driving this film.I remember when Ben Kingsley was good, but it's been ages since GANDHI, ages since even WITHOUT A CLUE. His recent stuff, with quality in mind, falls more along the lines of BLOODRAYNE and THE LOVE GURU. You see Ben Kingsley parading around in black eye makeup, and I don't think you need a SPOILER alert to suss out that his character is a knave of the most vile-hearted persuasion. When Prince Dastan is framed for a shocking murder, he flees for his life and he ends up taking the captive, combative Princess Tamina with him. And if you own one whit of movie-watching acumen, then it quickly dawns on you that this is the ideal platform for one of them lively, bickering romances. Sue me, I'm a sucker for a love story. And have you seen Gemma Arterton? Things palpitate when she's on screen.Not having seen much (or any) of Jake Gyllenhaal's films, I wasn't sure what to make of his being cast as the film's action hero. Thru some form of cultural osmosis, I've gathered that Jake is more the sort to dabble in indie cinema rather than be caught dead in a summer blockbuster. But not so. Jake Gyllenhaal, along with the good acting chops, is credible as the swashbuckling Prince Dastan. He buffs up for this one and brings a surprising physicality that's pretty dang Burt Lancasteresque.David Belle - who stars in the awesome DISTRICT B13 films - comes in as the picture's parkour coordinator, because our Dastan is this period piece practitioner of parkour. But parkour is only one element making up the spectacular action sequences and f/x. You cannot front on the production values. The CG is seamless. The sets and costumes are breathtaking and imaginative. The score is rousing. The sinister, black-clad ""Hassansins"" are properly menacing. Alfred Molina makes the most of his showy role as a desert bandit/tax evader. All of these elements - and the two beautiful leads - work to transport you to an enchanted desert realm where sand may invade your private bits but it's compensated for by deadly magic and wondrous, panoramic peril and Gemma Arterton's belly button.

The action sequences are top notch and the cinematography is gorgeous. Ben Kingsley makes a wonderful villain and Gemma Arterton is well cast as the strong willed and capable princess.However, the film has a number of flaws which drop it into the four star category. Jake Gyllenhall seems miscast as a prince here. He just doesn't look the part; he's more of an unkempt bad boy than a prince. He lacks the polish and nobility one usually associates with the hero of the Prince of Persia video games. I realize that a street smart brawler is what the screenplay was going for but it just didn't work for me.There are also annoying anachronisms. The Alfred Molina character was the worst offense; he sounded far too contemporary and takes one out of the fantasy world the film is trying to build up. Also, it is not clear exactly what Persia we're supposed to be seeing here. The Persian Empire of 2500 years ago? Persia of the Caliphate period? Both are hinted at. Or more likely, a Persia that never was?Worse by far is the plot. It involves a ""do over"" device - a dagger that can turn back time. This is more of a science fiction than fantasy element and completely robs the story of any suspense. Normally time travel stories get around this by emphasizing the clever uses of the paradoxes involved but there is little of that here. Only the scene where the prince deliberately kills himself to desperately make a point seems particularly well thought out.Summing up, this is an entertaining film but not a five star one.",4,"Beautiful film, flawed plot",1296604800,"02 2, 2011",2011,1662,"['recent', 'phenomenon', 'video', 'games', 'brought', 'life', 'big', 'screen', 'most', 'respects', 'translation', 'successful', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'cinematography', 'gorgeous', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'wonderful', 'villain', 'Gemma', 'Arterton', 'well', 'cast', 'strong', 'willed', 'capable', 'princess.However', 'film', 'number', 'flaws', 'drop', 'four', 'star', 'category', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhall', 'miscast', 'prince', 'here', 'just', ""n't"", 'look', 'part', 'more', 'unkempt', 'bad', 'boy', 'prince', 'polish', 'nobility', 'one', 'usually', 'hero', 'Prince', 'Persia', 'video', 'games', 'realize', 'street', 'smart', 'brawler', 'what', 'screenplay', 'was', 'going', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'me.There', 'are', 'also', 'annoying', 'anachronisms', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'character', 'was', 'worst', 'offense', 'sounded', 'far', 'too', 'contemporary', 'one', 'out', 'fantasy', 'world', 'film', 'trying', 'build', 'up', 'Also', 'not', 'clear', 'exactly', 'what', 'Persia', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'be', 'seeing', 'here', 'Persian', 'Empire', '2500', 'years', 'ago', 'Persia', 'Caliphate', 'period', 'are', 'hinted', 'more', 'likely', 'Persia', 'never', 'was', 'Worse', 'far', 'plot', 'do', 'device', 'dagger', 'can', 'turn', 'back', 'time', 'more', 'science', 'fiction', 'fantasy', 'element', 'completely', 'robs', 'story', 'suspense', 'Normally', 'time', 'travel', 'stories', 'get', 'emphasizing', 'clever', 'paradoxes', 'involved', 'little', 'here', 'Only', 'scene', 'where', 'prince', 'deliberately', 'desperately', 'make', 'point', 'particularly', 'well', 'thought', 'out.Summing', 'up', 'entertaining', 'film', 'not', 'five', 'star', 'one']",Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time 2010 Gemma Arterton

1346395,A2Q4WJ3NPIVA8E,B003IHUI0O,J. Kennedy,"[6, 17]","As a huge fan of the Prince of Persia video game series and Jake Gyllenhaal, of course I watched this film.  Although I can't fault the film for its great visuals, what makes this flick truly abysmal is the fact that no attention was paid to plot or logic at all.  I'm willing to suspend disbelief for a good romp at the movies, but there's a fine line between suspension of disbelief and nonsensical writing.The movie jumps around erratically and makes no explanations for the gaping holes that emerge in the plot.  I'll give you a perfect (non-spoiler) example.  Jake Gyllenhaal's Dastan is on the lam after being accused of being responsible for his father's demise.  The whole kingdom is looking for him, so of course he heads back to the kingdom where many other kingdoms are gathering for the king's memorial.  A funeral procession is marching down the street.  We see Dastan traipsing across the tops of buildings and down through alleyways, completely unnoticed.  Okay, that's fine.  The games were filled with such feats of stealth.But after a quick cut, Dastan is suddenly kneeling over his father's casket and paying homage.  I should point out here that his father's casket is in a canopy that is being carried down a busy street as the focus of a procession that includes foreign dignitaries, royal court, guards, and so on all walking nearby.  His father's brother/advisor is walking next to the casket.  Dastan spends a moment or two speaking to his father's remains then flees the canopy.Yes.  That means that Dastan was able to slip past an entire crowd of people standing at the side of the road, slink unseen into the canopy his father was being carried in, the men carrying the canopy didn't notice the shift in weight at all, Dastan isn't heard through the canopy only inches from his uncle's ears, he then exits the canopy and leaves back through the crowd with nary a dignitary or onlooker spotting him.  Oh...and he also slipped a note into his uncle's pocket through the canopy's gaping flap without notice.I wish I could say that this was the only moment in the film that made little to no sense.  The special effects are stunning but without a story (or at least a vague semblance of continuity) to ground them, they're nothing more than pretty lights and sounds.I know some people enjoy movies like this.  They like watching the great fight sequences with their stunning choreography and CG effects.  If you prefer your films driven primarily by the effects department, then you can ignore my review and you'll probably enjoy this film.  But if you like a good story that you can follow and that doesn't leave you wondering if the director actually read the script before shooting, then I'm willing to bet you will be less than enthused about this shamble of a pseudo-adaptation.",1,Action and special effects are this film's only successes,1306800000,"05 31, 2011",2011,2807,"['huge', 'fan', 'Prince', 'Persia', 'video', 'game', 'series', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'course', 'watched', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fault', 'film', 'great', 'visuals', 'what', 'flick', 'truly', 'abysmal', 'fact', 'attention', 'was', 'paid', 'plot', 'logic', ""'m"", 'willing', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'good', 'romp', 'movies', 'fine', 'line', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'nonsensical', 'writing.The', 'movie', 'erratically', 'explanations', 'gaping', 'emerge', 'plot', ""'ll"", 'give', 'perfect', 'non-spoiler', 'example', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Dastan', 'lam', 'being', 'accused', 'being', 'responsible', 'father', 'demise', 'whole', 'kingdom', 'looking', 'so', 'course', 'back', 'kingdom', 'where', 'many', 'other', 'kingdoms', 'are', 'gathering', 'king', 'memorial', 'funeral', 'procession', 'marching', 'down', 'street', 'see', 'Dastan', 'traipsing', 'tops', 'buildings', 'down', 'alleyways', 'completely', 'unnoticed', 'Okay', 'fine', 'games', 'were', 'filled', 'such', 'feats', 'stealth.But', 'quick', 'cut', 'Dastan', 'suddenly', 'kneeling', 'father', 'casket', 'paying', 'homage', 'should', 'point', 'out', 'here', 'father', 'casket', 'canopy', 'being', 'carried', 'busy', 'street', 'focus', 'procession', 'foreign', 'dignitaries', 'royal', 'court', 'guards', 'so', 'walking', 'nearby', 'father', 'brother/advisor', 'walking', 'next', 'casket', 'Dastan', 'moment', 'two', 'speaking', 'father', 'remains', 'then', 'canopy.Yes', 'Dastan', 'was', 'able', 'slip', 'entire', 'crowd', 'people', 'standing', 'side', 'road', 'slink', 'unseen', 'canopy', 'father', 'was', 'being', 'carried', 'men', 'carrying', 'canopy', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'shift', 'weight', 'Dastan', ""n't"", 'heard', 'canopy', 'only', 'uncle', 'ears', 'then', 'canopy', 'back', 'crowd', 'dignitary', 'onlooker', 'spotting', 'Oh', 'also', 'slipped', 'note', 'uncle', 'pocket', 'canopy', 'gaping', 'flap', 'notice.I', 'wish', 'could', 'say', 'was', 'only', 'moment', 'film', 'made', 'little', 'sense', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'stunning', 'story', 'least', 'vague', 'semblance', 'continuity', 'ground', ""'re"", 'nothing', 'more', 'pretty', 'lights', 'sounds.I', 'know', 'people', 'enjoy', 'movies', 'watching', 'great', 'fight', 'sequences', 'stunning', 'choreography', 'CG', 'effects', 'prefer', 'films', 'driven', 'primarily', 'effects', 'department', 'then', 'can', 'ignore', 'review', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'enjoy', 'film', 'like', 'good', 'story', 'can', 'follow', ""n't"", 'leave', 'wondering', 'director', 'actually', 'read', 'script', 'shooting', 'then', ""'m"", 'willing', 'bet', 'will', 'be', 'less', 'enthused', 'shamble', 'pseudo-adaptation']",Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time 2010 Gemma Arterton

OK, now imagine they sneeze really, really hard--> out pops Prince of Persia.  While the special effects are great the story is predictable and feels like you've seen it before.  EXample:  Alldin and the future Prince of Persia are both ""diamonds in the rough (i.e. orphan street rats)""  Alladin steels an apple in the market place; Prince of Persia pays for it in the market place.  A pompous lord is about to run over a poor peasant then hit him then Alladin/Prince of Persia does the noble thing and rescues him.  The chase seen through the market place for both is very similar (minus abu the monkey).  The Princess of the town the Persians attack is exactly like Jasmine in Alladin (self-assured, not going to take crap or marry the ""typical"" prince.  The bulk of the story has the Princess and Prince of Persia stealing the ""sacred dagger"" back and forth from each other while betraying the other one constantly.  This part is pretty boring and predictable (would you believe they find themselves falling in love through all the betrayals?  Who could have guessed that?  I like all the actors and actresses but the characters are flat and predictable.  A lot of the bad guys and the ending with the giant hour glass of time reminds me of Raiders of the Lost arc.  Now if you are wondering if there is a magic carpet the answer is no!  So that is a difference but not really because they make up for it by having the Prince of Persia have spiderman like skill so he doesn't need the carpet guy.  This dude can absolutely fly and walk up walls and hold on with one hand to a slippery step when tons of sand is dumping on top of him.  Pretty cool except he doesn't have the red and blue suit.

1346398,A6X6LNZO1C3EZ,B003IHUI0O,J. Munyon,"[1, 3]","""Prince of Persia: Sands of Time,"" is a Walt Disney film.  Too bad.  If they had shown gratuitous female nudity (heroine or in the harem sequence) this film would be a blockbuster epic great.  As it stands, it is way too focused upon ancient Persian warfare weapons in a documentary type impetus, and they allowed many stunts by the main male lead to obviously echoe much of the 1992 Disney animated feature named ""Aladdin"" where he gets away over the roof tops and via acrobatics that would only be possible for extremely well trained, very fit athletes who work out frequently and stay on a rigorously proper nutrition, avoiding any frivolous party life.  In other words, this film has the traitorous bad guy lose, the hero gets the girl, there's magic, there's death dealt but deserved so nobody cares.  It's a typical Disney film.  Darts, arrows, knives, swords, spears, hack, hack, stab, stab, assassins so deadly Chuck Norris would hide, but this hero kicks their ass.  Like I said, the film needed some girls to show off their assets.  We need new stuff that hasn't been over-used so much for so many years, or else throw me some eye candy.  I watched this film because Ben Kingsley was in it, and up until now that made me believe any movie had merit.  I'll look closer next time.  The 2004 version of ""Troy"" with Brad Pitt has far better sword fights, The 2003 version of ""Helen of Troy"" with Sienna Guillory has far better sword fights, ""Spartacus,"" ""Braveheart,"" ""The Princess Bride,"" and the ""Underworld"" trilogy with Kate Beckinsale all have better sword fights.  Heroic bravery is better in the movie, ""300"" about Thermopylae where in 480 B.C., 300 Spartans blocked hundreds of thousands of Persians for three days.  ""Prince of Persia: Sands of Time"" needs to have some substance instead of just so much flash.  If Disney wants to make epic films with real people in ancient history settings of barbaric warring people, the rest of the realism anticipated in those films by the majority is that there will be some female nudity.  Otherwise they should stick to animation, comedies, or nature documentaries.  There should have been graphic beheadings, limbs hacked off, disembowelment, and streams of blood (and female nudity).  It's a battle movie, trying to be a love story, but the only thing brutal about it is how the movie stays so politically correct.

1346404,A1DJMQJ3NY7TV5,B003IHUI0O,Jordan David,"[0, 0]","While I was watching Newell's Persia, the only thing that constantly reminded me of this film's video game roots actually had nothing to do with the aesthetics themselves.More on that later.  It needs to be declared, however, that Newell is quite possibly the first director to ""trick"" an ignorant audience out of playing their hand and avoiding video game adaptions like it had the word ""Bubonic"" in its title.  I mean, my grandparents were anticipating this movie.  This simply could not be echoed for previous entries into this misguided and struggling genre.  That's the power of Bruckheimer and Disney at it's finest, folks.But, is it really a turnaround that will pave the way for future video games to hit the big screen?  Again, it needs to be reiterated that this feels nothing like its source material, and that wasn't a mistake, I assure you.  Basically, Disney has been the one to step up to the plate and crush the hearts of purists by using their actions to say, ""this movie is owes itself to a game, but damned if we'll tell the rest of the world if we want it to make money.""  And, if first-day results are of any indication (and they always are with the producers), it worked.It's just too bad that they couldn't make it any better than its predecessors.  The prince fails just about as painfully as any other video game adaptation, but for very different reasons.  The production values are there, more than ever.  The talent is there, and they work with it.  The action is there, and that was never really an issue to begin with?  So, what's the problem?  What isn't there?  Well, everything else, essentially.The Persia franchise was never really much for a story.  Rather, it instead took the hearts of high-brow critics (who know, those looking for a story in video games) by having a terrific script and committed voice actors.  That stands as something genuinely unique and bullet-worthy for a game.  In a movie, they're generally prerequisites.  Alas, that's not to say that this movie even HAS a decent script, because it really doesn't, and that comes through with an editing process that goes all kinds of tweako.  Those who have kept up with me will know of my affection for a movie with a good rhythm; a good PACE.  Persia has about as much rhythm as an individual has intelligence for believing that airplanes in the night sky are shooting stars.Its erratic formula pushes the audience further and further away, leaving us so flabbergasted midway through that the action sequences are a welcome brain funk.  Speaking of which, they also suffer from an over-enthusiastic party of editors, but it's ultimately offset by the enjoyable tug-o-war between a set of protagonists and antagonists that mesh well together.  The Hassansins, a bit like pseduo desert nazgul, are especially enjoyable to watch.Unfortunately, they can't stay on the screen forever, and as far as chemistry goes, that which lies between Dastan (Gyllenhaal) and Tamina (the increasingly more beautiful Arterton) is about as consistent as....well, the editing (that's the last time I'll bring it up).  The movie itself is in dire need of a standout peformance; Molina was obviously designed to be the crowd pleaser, and he undoubtedly has his moments but, really, no one takes center stage, and it's a problem.So, no, Disney has not yet discovered the formula for creating a cash cow out of a video game adaptation.  They've simply sidestepped all of it and a movie that is, in its own right, not very good and, from a gamer's standpoint, still not very good.  I can see future articles claiming that this will be seen as a stepping stone towards an revolution in the sub-genre, but don't be fooled and, honestly, I'd settle with advising that you not go see this movie, aside from proving the theory that Arterton seemingly gets more attractive as the months roll by.",2,Prince of Persia:  The Sand of Time,1324166400,"12 18, 2011",2011,3865,"['was', 'watching', 'Newell', 'Persia', 'only', 'thing', 'constantly', 'reminded', 'film', 'video', 'game', 'roots', 'actually', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'aesthetics', 'themselves.More', 'later', 'be', 'declared', 'however', 'Newell', 'quite', 'possibly', 'first', 'director', 'trick', 'ignorant', 'audience', 'playing', 'hand', 'avoiding', 'video', 'game', 'adaptions', 'had', 'word', 'Bubonic', 'title', 'mean', 'grandparents', 'were', 'anticipating', 'movie', 'simply', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'echoed', 'previous', 'entries', 'misguided', 'struggling', 'genre', 'power', 'Bruckheimer', 'Disney', 'finest', 'folks.But', 'really', 'turnaround', 'will', 'pave', 'way', 'future', 'video', 'games', 'hit', 'big', 'screen', 'Again', 'be', 'reiterated', 'nothing', 'source', 'material', 'was', ""n't"", 'mistake', 'assure', 'Basically', 'Disney', 'been', 'one', 'step', 'up', 'plate', 'crush', 'hearts', 'purists', 'using', 'actions', 'say', 'movie', 'owes', 'game', 'damned', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'rest', 'world', 'want', 'make', 'money', 'first-day', 'results', 'are', 'indication', 'always', 'are', 'producers', 'worked.It', 'just', 'too', 'bad', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'better', 'predecessors', 'prince', 'just', 'about', 'as', 'painfully', 'other', 'video', 'game', 'adaptation', 'very', 'different', 'reasons', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'there', 'more', 'ever', 'talent', 'there', 'work', 'action', 'there', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'issue', 'begin', 'So', 'what', 'problem', 'What', ""n't"", 'Well', 'everything', 'else', 'essentially.The', 'Persia', 'franchise', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'much', 'story', 'Rather', 'instead', 'took', 'hearts', 'high-brow', 'critics', 'who', 'know', 'looking', 'story', 'video', 'games', 'having', 'terrific', 'script', 'committed', 'voice', 'actors', 'something', 'genuinely', 'unique', 'bullet-worthy', 'game', 'movie', ""'re"", 'generally', 'prerequisites', 'Alas', 'not', 'say', 'movie', 'even', 'decent', 'script', 'really', ""n't"", 'through', 'editing', 'process', 'kinds', 'tweako', 'who', 'have', 'kept', 'up', 'will', 'know', 'affection', 'movie', 'good', 'rhythm', 'good', 'PACE', 'Persia', 'about', 'as', 'much', 'rhythm', 'individual', 'intelligence', 'believing', 'airplanes', 'night', 'sky', 'are', 'shooting', 'stars.Its', 'erratic', 'formula', 'audience', 'further', 'further', 'away', 'leaving', 'so', 'flabbergasted', 'midway', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'welcome', 'brain', 'funk', 'Speaking', 'also', 'suffer', 'over-enthusiastic', 'party', 'editors', 'ultimately', 'offset', 'enjoyable', 'tug-o-war', 'set', 'protagonists', 'antagonists', 'mesh', 'well', 'together', 'Hassansins', 'bit', 'pseduo', 'desert', 'nazgul', 'are', 'especially', 'enjoyable', 'watch.Unfortunately', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stay', 'screen', 'forever', 'as', 'far', 'chemistry', 'Dastan', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Tamina', 'increasingly', 'more', 'beautiful', 'Arterton', 'as', 'consistent', '.well', 'editing', 'last', 'time', ""'ll"", 'bring', 'up', 'movie', 'dire', 'need', 'standout', 'peformance', 'Molina', 'was', 'obviously', 'designed', 'be', 'crowd', 'pleaser', 'undoubtedly', 'moments', 'really', 'one', 'center', 'stage', 'problem.So', 'Disney', 'not', 'yet', 'discovered', 'formula', 'creating', 'cash', 'cow', 'video', 'game', 'adaptation', ""'ve"", 'simply', 'sidestepped', 'movie', 'own', 'right', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'gamer', 'standpoint', 'still', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'can', 'see', 'future', 'articles', 'claiming', 'will', 'be', 'seen', 'stepping', 'stone', 'towards', 'revolution', 'sub-genre', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'honestly', ""'d"", 'settle', 'advising', 'not', 'go', 'see', 'movie', 'aside', 'proving', 'theory', 'Arterton', 'seemingly', 'more', 'attractive', 'months', 'roll']",Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time 2010 Gemma Arterton

In the mold of Bruckheimer, some things are not meant to be taken seriously, but I must commend him for making the best video game based movie I have ever witnessed.The title Sands of Time, refers to the power of a magical dagger that can send its bearer a few seconds into the past to ""change"" the event that just occurred (similar to the weapon the Prince carries in the video game). The one who possesses this power can undo a previous action or even prevent themselves from just being killed. Without giving anything away, the story eventually unfolds to a darker danger to time itself if the dagger falls into the wrong hands.Jake Gyllenhaal delivers as the happy-go-lucky Prince who comes of age to figure out the mystery of the dagger and attempt to stop those who threaten his family and the legacy of the kingdom. Gemma Arterton contrasts as the witty and beautiful Princess Tamina who stoutly serves as the hero's foil while herself experiencing a personality check as the movie progresses. Ben Kingsley is always a professional and the great Alfred Molina completely steals the show as Sheik Amar in his scenes!One thing must also be said - DO NOT TAKE THE TRAILERS AND TV SPOTS AS THE MOVIE! As far as I am concerned, the Marketing Dept dropped the ball on this; creating a perception that this is a movie of mindless action and flirtatious banter between the stars (""Why can't you keep your eyes off of me???"" nonsense). There are some hysterical moments between the Prince and Tamina, brilliant stunts (the Prince's action scenes are very close to what he would do in the video game), and a story that revolves around trust, hope and not giving up on the love of one's family.If you loved Pirates of the Carribbean...this one will not dissapoint (In my opinion, it is certainly better than Dead Man's Chest and At Worlds End by a long shot!)",5,A movie for the popcorn movie goer!,1281398400,"08 10, 2010",2010,2255,"['Even', 'not', 'Bluray/DVD', 'yet', 'am', 'providing', 'quick', 'review', 'already', 'given', '3', 'star', 'rating', 'due', 'complaints', 'original', 'price', 'tag', 'seen', 'price', 'dropped', '20s', 'where', 'normal', 'Amazon', 'Bluray', 'first', 'settles', '.Anyway', 'love', 'movies', 'intriguing', 'story', 'nonsensical', 'action', 'splurge', 'humor', 'unyielding', 'message', 'Prince', 'Persia', 'mold', 'Bruckheimer', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'must', 'commend', 'making', 'best', 'video', 'game', 'based', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'witnessed.The', 'title', 'Sands', 'Time', 'refers', 'power', 'magical', 'dagger', 'can', 'send', 'bearer', 'few', 'seconds', 'past', 'change', 'event', 'just', 'occurred', 'similar', 'weapon', 'Prince', 'video', 'game', 'one', 'who', 'power', 'can', 'undo', 'previous', 'action', 'even', 'prevent', 'just', 'being', 'killed', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'story', 'eventually', 'darker', 'danger', 'time', 'dagger', 'wrong', 'hands.Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'delivers', 'happy-go-lucky', 'Prince', 'who', 'age', 'figure', 'out', 'mystery', 'dagger', 'attempt', 'stop', 'who', 'threaten', 'family', 'legacy', 'kingdom', 'Gemma', 'Arterton', 'witty', 'beautiful', 'Princess', 'Tamina', 'who', 'stoutly', 'hero', 'foil', 'experiencing', 'personality', 'check', 'movie', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'always', 'professional', 'great', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'completely', 'show', 'Sheik', 'Amar', 'scenes', 'One', 'thing', 'must', 'also', 'be', 'said', 'DO', 'NOT', 'TAKE', 'THE', 'TRAILERS', 'AND', 'TV', 'SPOTS', 'THE', 'MOVIE', 'As', 'far', 'am', 'concerned', 'Marketing', 'Dept', 'dropped', 'ball', 'creating', 'perception', 'movie', 'mindless', 'action', 'flirtatious', 'banter', 'stars', 'Why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'eyes', 'nonsense', 'are', 'hysterical', 'moments', 'Prince', 'Tamina', 'brilliant', 'stunts', 'Prince', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'close', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'video', 'game', 'story', 'around', 'trust', 'hope', 'not', 'giving', 'up', 'love', 'one', 'family.If', 'loved', 'Pirates', 'Carribbean', 'one', 'will', 'not', 'dissapoint', 'opinion', 'certainly', 'better', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Chest', 'Worlds', 'End', 'long', 'shot']",Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time 2010 Gemma Arterton

Thank you, Walt, for paving the way.Our story begins in ancient Persia.  The king has a couple of sons already when he comes upon a young orphan boy who displays unusual courage to help another boy.  The king admires the orphan and adopts him, making him another son (and another prince.)  He is raised as a brother/son/prince.  (Pardon me if I misspell any of these names.)  Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal) is the orphan.  Prince Tusk is the eldest son and the future heir to the throne.  Ben Kingsley plays an advisor to the king and the trusted uncle to the sons of the king, including Dastan.Dastan is a very spirited, street-smart young man.  He does not act snooty and he is not afraid to fight.  When Prince Tusk receives information that the Holy City of Alamut is making weapons to be used against the Persian kingdom, the sons decide to attack.  It is in Alamut that we see Dastan's bravery and fighting skills and we meet the beautiful Princess Kamina (Gemma Arterton). We also learn that the Princess is the guardian of a very special dagger, one that is capable of going back in time, with the potential to alter events of the past. (You can surely imagine that the bad guys would want the dagger.)There are lots of acrobatic stunts, CGI, tons of practically non-stop action, adventure, betrayal, assassins, impossible odds, mystical happenings, treachery, greed, power, and destiny with a little love and spirituality to boot.  You even get to see ostrich races.Great story!",5,It's all about the dagger. . .,1275696000,"06 5, 2010",2010,1628,"['LOVED', 'Just', 'saw', 'one', 'theater', 'was', 'about', '2', 'hours', 'practically', 'non-stop', 'adventure', 'Disney', 'flicks', 'have', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'Thank', 'Walt', 'paving', 'way.Our', 'story', 'ancient', 'Persia', 'king', 'couple', 'sons', 'already', 'when', 'young', 'orphan', 'boy', 'who', 'unusual', 'courage', 'help', 'boy', 'king', 'orphan', 'making', 'son', 'prince', 'raised', 'brother/son/prince', 'Pardon', 'misspell', 'names', 'Dastan', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'orphan', 'Prince', 'Tusk', 'eldest', 'son', 'future', 'heir', 'throne', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'advisor', 'king', 'trusted', 'uncle', 'sons', 'king', 'including', 'Dastan.Dastan', 'very', 'spirited', 'street-smart', 'young', 'man', 'not', 'act', 'snooty', 'not', 'afraid', 'fight', 'When', 'Prince', 'Tusk', 'information', 'Holy', 'City', 'Alamut', 'making', 'weapons', 'be', 'used', 'Persian', 'kingdom', 'sons', 'decide', 'attack', 'Alamut', 'see', 'Dastan', 'bravery', 'fighting', 'skills', 'meet', 'beautiful', 'Princess', 'Kamina', 'Gemma', 'Arterton', 'also', 'learn', 'Princess', 'guardian', 'very', 'special', 'dagger', 'one', 'capable', 'going', 'back', 'time', 'potential', 'alter', 'events', 'past', 'can', 'surely', 'imagine', 'bad', 'guys', 'would', 'want', 'dagger', 'are', 'lots', 'acrobatic', 'stunts', 'CGI', 'tons', 'practically', 'non-stop', 'action', 'adventure', 'betrayal', 'assassins', 'impossible', 'odds', 'mystical', 'happenings', 'treachery', 'greed', 'power', 'destiny', 'little', 'love', 'spirituality', 'boot', 'even', 'get', 'see', 'ostrich', 'races.Great', 'story']",Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time 2010 Gemma Arterton

That puts it in the same genre as THE PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN, which is a much better film.Jake Gyllenhall (Prince Dastan) tries very hard to carry it off. A one-time street urchin, he has been adopted by the Persian Emperor and raised alongside the princes of the blood. When the expansionist Persian army comes to the holy city of Alamut, they are forbidden to lay siege to it, but the Emperor's brother Nizam (Ben Kingsley) orders the city attacked anyway, and its riches despoiled.Among these riches are Princess Tamina (Gemma Arterton) who is the high priestess of the Alamut cult, and a dagger which has the ability to turn back time. Nizam wishes to use it for his own greedy ends. It becomes Dastan's task to stop Nizam.Loaded with intricate, fantastical Middle Eastern settings, a good storyline, and the action that is Jerry Bruckheimer's trademark, PRINCE OF PERSIA certainly holds the viewer's attention.The weakness of this film is the casting. Gyllenhaal's Dastan is credible, but lacks the wit of Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow, and is short on the action hero chops of Orlando Bloom's Will Turner. Gemma Arterton, who has an impressive resume, is very pretty as the Arabian princess, but her character's personality and behavior veer wildly between the Sixth Century BCE and the 21st Century CE; one minute she is the retiring and devout priestess, while the next minute she might be shouting, ""Let's go Mets!"" and spilling beer on herself at a ballgame.  Ben Kingsley isn't at all convincing as the evil Nizam, who starts out as the Princes' kindly Uncle. He seems to want to stay in that groove.Still, this is a good film to share with the family.",3,"""Like sands through the hourglass . . .

Do you love colorful action scenes where the hero's hair looks like he just came from the stylist two seconds ago...even after a five-minute sword fight? Do you not mind insipid dialogue matched with wooden acting? Does a movie based on a video game sound like high quality cinematic genius? Well, Prince Of Persia awaits!This is by far the worst acting I've seen out of Gyllenhall, whom I normally enjoy. Maybe the script was just so hackneyed that he gave up before he even started, and spent all his time on bicep curls. He's clearly more into looking good than acting well here, and only Alfred Molina and Ben Kingsley (!...?...$) deliver anything approaching an enjoyable performance. I'm all for mindless summer fare, but when a movie is based on a video game and the video game delivers more dramatic cohesion, it's a bad sign.The parkour stunts are nowhere near as much fun as they could have been, and despite the obvious mega-millions spent on sets and cgi, they could have spent more time making the actors look real instead of fresh from the makeup trailer. The props etc are wonderful, but everybody looks so made-up and Hollywood that it all just never gels.The blu-ray transfer is good but all that does is highlight the cheesy make-up everyone has on in every scene. Not to mention Jake's and the Princess' hairdos. Their hair is the true star here. If only the dialogue had been given as much attention. For all the wonderful Moroccan scenery, POP still looks like an over-budgeted Hollywood Blockbuster TM, every step of the way.Don Simpson would be so proud.I'd rather watch the original Sinbad films in all their glorious hokeyness than this passable but ultimately mediocre tripe, any day.Get the video games; they offer much more fun for your entertainment dollar.",3,"Looks good but the video games are better, and so are the original Sinbad etc movies",1284508800,"09 15, 2010",2010,2030,"['have', 'obligation', 'make', 'history.We', 'have', 'obligation', 'make', 'art.We', 'have', 'obligation', 'make', 'statement.Our', 'obligation', 'make', 'money', '-Don', 'Simpson', 'longtime', 'partner', 'Jerry', 'Bruckheimer.Is', 'Jerry', 'Bruckheimer', 'filmmaking', 'hero', 'Do', 'love', 'colorful', 'action', 'scenes', 'where', 'hero', 'hair', 'just', 'came', 'stylist', 'two', 'seconds', 'even', 'five-minute', 'sword', 'fight', 'Do', 'not', 'mind', 'insipid', 'dialogue', 'matched', 'wooden', 'acting', 'movie', 'based', 'video', 'game', 'sound', 'high', 'quality', 'cinematic', 'genius', 'Well', 'Prince', 'Persia', 'far', 'worst', 'acting', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Gyllenhall', 'whom', 'normally', 'enjoy', 'Maybe', 'script', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'hackneyed', 'gave', 'up', 'even', 'started', 'spent', 'time', 'bicep', 'curls', 'clearly', 'more', 'looking', 'good', 'acting', 'well', 'here', 'only', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'deliver', 'anything', 'approaching', 'enjoyable', 'performance', ""'m"", 'mindless', 'summer', 'fare', 'when', 'movie', 'based', 'video', 'game', 'video', 'game', 'more', 'dramatic', 'cohesion', 'bad', 'sign.The', 'parkour', 'stunts', 'are', 'nowhere', 'as', 'much', 'fun', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'obvious', 'mega-millions', 'spent', 'sets', 'cgi', 'could', 'have', 'spent', 'more', 'time', 'making', 'actors', 'look', 'real', 'instead', 'fresh', 'makeup', 'trailer', 'props', 'are', 'wonderful', 'everybody', 'so', 'made-up', 'Hollywood', 'just', 'never', 'gels.The', 'blu-ray', 'transfer', 'good', 'highlight', 'cheesy', 'make-up', 'everyone', 'scene', 'Not', 'mention', 'Jake', 'Princess', 'hairdos', 'hair', 'true', 'star', 'here', 'only', 'dialogue', 'had', 'been', 'given', 'much', 'attention', 'wonderful', 'Moroccan', 'scenery', 'POP', 'still', 'over-budgeted', 'Hollywood', 'Blockbuster', 'TM', 'step', 'way.Don', 'Simpson', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'proud.I', ""'d"", 'rather', 'watch', 'original', 'Sinbad', 'films', 'glorious', 'hokeyness', 'passable', 'ultimately', 'mediocre', 'tripe', 'day.Get', 'video', 'games', 'offer', 'much', 'more', 'fun', 'entertainment', 'dollar']",Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time 2010 Gemma Arterton

Both were extemely annoyed that this show did not follow the plot of the game at all.  In fact, both wanted to give the movie negative stars.On the other hand, since I haven't played videogames in approximately 10 years (ever since my children started kicking my butt), I had no such preconceptions.  It simply looked like a good adventure flick to me.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed.My daughter's description of the show was simply that it looked like ""they took the video game, wrapped Aladdin around it, and threw in bad guys who looked like the Nazgul from Lord of the Rings.""  I've got to agree that the film had all the depth and creativity of a film created via Disney marketing research experts.My children tell me that in the game, the prince was not a street-urchin like Aladdin. To the extent that he was rewritten to be like Aladdin, one can see the entrance of Disney focus groups and market research specialists.There is some good and bad acting in the film. Jake Gyllenhaal does a creditable job in a pretty standard action flick.  He doesn't look Persian, but then most of the cast didn't either.  Gyllenhaal's proto-English accent stayed in place pretty well.In contrast, the female lead was highly forgettable.

One of them is a son-by-blood and the other is a son-by-adoption.2. There is a scheming vizier who is brother of the king.3. The vizier sets up an invasion of a neighboring kingdom under false pretenses in order to obtain a weapon that will allow him to go back in time and become the ruler of the Persian Empire.4. The vizier murders the king and frames the adopted son for it.5. The adopted son overcomes all manner of obstacles, to protect the magic weapon, saves the day,and gets the girl.There are lots of good things to say about this movie.1. Many films do lots of special effects in order to cover up an excessively weak (or excessively convoluted) plot. This film had a great, clear plot. It was involved enough to not be pedestrian, but not so long as to lose the viewer.2. There was not one single word of profanity in this film, and yet the writing was still enough to get the point across.3. The action scenes in this film were great. They (=the scenes) demonstrated ACTING. So, we had actors who could do a great job as characters (Ben Kingsley) and also as athletes (Jake Gyllenhaal).4. The special effects were great-- especially since they were intended as supplements to the plot and not as ""coverups"" for a bad plot.5.

The movie, although somewhat ""cheesy"" at times, is overall entertaining and a fun interlude for family oriented entertainment.  I was pleasantly surprised that Jake Gyllenhaal could pull off a swashbuckler role as naturally as he did.Jake Gyllenhaal plays a smart, fast-witted adopted prince named Dastan.  His father, the King of Persia,  found him as an orphaned poor boy in a marketplace and saw something special in his demeanor and reaction to threats.  Dastan grew up with the King's two biological sons and they accepted him as their own.  When the three princes traveled together, they were doing their father's work checking on the desert cities of the Persian Kingdom.  There is also an evil Uncle i(Ben Kingsley) to make the story interesting.  The movie shows the princes and soldiers coming upon a city they debate whether to raid.  At this point, the movie gets interesting.  Paths seem to diverge as Dastan and a mysterious princess Tamina (Gemmea Arterton) band together to protect an ancient dagger that can release the Sands of Time.  This is a gift from the gods that can reverse time and only the possessor knows what has happened.The special effects keep you interested, as well as the time rewinding sequences.  The film gives plenty of action scenes, including a crazy ostrich race, and characters that keep an interesting story overall.  The kids will love it.

1346440,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B003IHUI0O,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","This fantasy adventure film was made for pure entertainment and it fills this role pretty nicely. Not a masterpiece but a nice watch. Below, some more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.As the title indicates this film was inspired by the old computer game ""Prince of Persia"", of which it keeps the premise (Thousand and One Nights-like lands), the main hero Dastan, who actually is kind of a prince of Persia (even if he was adopted, not born in royalty) and the swashbuckling and acrobatic character of story. Jake Gyllenhaal is maybe not exactly the kind of actor I would immediately associate with adventure/action films but in this one he proves that with enough makeup, CGIs and the help of a battalion of stuntsmen anybody can be a hero... Which is kind of a heartening message... Also, as dialogs in this film are not half bad, the actor playing the heroic prince can actually do here some occasional acting, between two acrobacies covered by his stuntsmen.All those who enjoyed the three old ""Sinbad"" films will most probably like this film too. As always in this kind of movies there must also be an evil guy and here this role is played by no other than Sir Ben Kingsley - who is really a pleasure to watch.Also, there must be a chick in slave's outfit and lo and behold, there is one and a very pleasant sight she is, as it is Gemma Arterton who plays here. Her character, Tamina, has the necessary shapes and also quite a mouth, which she doesn't hesitate to put to good use once she meets the prince - for dialogs, of course... Because, you know, dialogs are good... And ever since Leia all princesses need to have a mouth which they put to good use once they meet an attractive guy - for dialogs, of course... Because, you know, dialogs are good... OK, I stop here.The film is visually quite pleasant and this is why I bought it on Blu-ray (it was actually the first Blu-ray I ever bought) and it was rather a good decision.Bottom line, this is a film made for pure entertainment and quite good for this kind of film, with some good action, good effects, some nice verbal sniping between the two main characters and an obligatory happy ending, complete with the obligatory betrothal and the promise of glorious bedding - I mean wedding...

If you recognize that it's a Disney movie and a sand and sandal fantasy, you pretty much know what to expect. It's not hugely different from the Mummy films in disregard for historic or cultural accuracy, is just as humorous and anachronistic and even more opulent and visually gorgeous. Maybe it needed to also be a monster film to be accepted? For whatever reason it was hated, I have to say that it's really quite enjoyable on the terms in which it was intended: a modern version of the sort of Sindbad/Sabu movies from the 60s and 70s. Jake Gyllenhaal is so likeable as an actor that his thief-turned-prince is engaging regardless of setting. Gemma Arerton's character is initially as stiff as a board, then a stereotypic haughty priestess and most of the time the actress doesn't rise above the script but she does occasionally make a good impression. She has reasonable chemistry with Gyllenhaal and the banter between the two works just fine in service to the story. The time-slip gimmick, I presume from the video games which I admit I have never played, is interesting and well explored and the entire plot moves along smoothly and ties up well. It's a hundred times better than, say Scorpion King, no more fantastic than any other crazy artifact film (Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull for instance), and it moves through the paces deftly without falling apart or losing track of the story it wants to tell. Supporting cast are excellent.So. Gone into with the correct expectations, there's really nothing wrong with this film. It's all about updating Sinbad for the new generation and anyone who's seen those movies knows it's not about realistic situations and Academy Award level acting. It's a big shiny bauble of a story that sounds like Aladdin and looks like a theme park's version of royal Morocco.",4,Better than advertised.,1338681600,"06 3, 2012",2012,1862,"[""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'vilified', 'recognize', 'Disney', 'movie', 'sand', 'sandal', 'fantasy', 'pretty', 'much', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'not', 'hugely', 'different', 'Mummy', 'films', 'disregard', 'historic', 'cultural', 'accuracy', 'just', 'as', 'humorous', 'anachronistic', 'even', 'more', 'opulent', 'visually', 'gorgeous', 'Maybe', 'needed', 'also', 'be', 'monster', 'film', 'be', 'accepted', 'reason', 'was', 'hated', 'have', 'say', 'really', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'terms', 'was', 'intended', 'modern', 'version', 'sort', 'Sindbad/Sabu', 'movies', '60s', '70s', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'so', 'likeable', 'actor', 'thief-turned-prince', 'engaging', 'regardless', 'setting', 'Gemma', 'Arerton', 'character', 'initially', 'as', 'stiff', 'board', 'then', 'stereotypic', 'haughty', 'priestess', 'most', 'time', 'actress', ""n't"", 'rise', 'script', 'occasionally', 'make', 'good', 'impression', 'reasonable', 'chemistry', 'Gyllenhaal', 'banter', 'two', 'works', 'just', 'fine', 'service', 'story', 'time-slip', 'gimmick', 'presume', 'video', 'games', 'admit', 'have', 'never', 'played', 'interesting', 'well', 'explored', 'entire', 'plot', 'moves', 'smoothly', 'up', 'well', 'hundred', 'times', 'better', 'say', 'Scorpion', 'King', 'more', 'fantastic', 'other', 'crazy', 'artifact', 'film', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'Crystal', 'Skull', 'instance', 'paces', 'deftly', 'falling', 'apart', 'losing', 'track', 'story', 'tell', 'Supporting', 'cast', 'are', 'excellent.So', 'Gone', 'correct', 'expectations', 'really', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'film', 'updating', 'Sinbad', 'new', 'generation', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'movies', 'knows', 'not', 'realistic', 'situations', 'Academy', 'Award', 'level', 'acting', 'big', 'shiny', 'bauble', 'story', 'Aladdin', 'theme', 'park', 'version', 'royal', 'Morocco']",Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time 2010 Gemma Arterton

Dastan grows up to be a fighter, however his brothers and uncle turn on him. He flees into the desert with a princess and a murderous horde attempting to steal the dagger he acquired in his last battle.ReviewMy disclaimer is that I have never played the Prince of Persia video games. Though I can always tell a video game sequence homage, and this movie certainly pays it's dues to the look and feel of the actual games. Disney managed to recapture some of the magic that they had created with the original Pirates of the Caribbean minus the overly annoying Keira Knightly. It also has the random accents found in so many Disney movies. Jake Gyllenhaal is good looking and easy to love, though lacking in any kind of deep thought. The plot moves quickly, and the visual effects are great. The fight sequences are a little choppy, but very reminiscent of game play. There are some very funny moments, such as a rant about taxes and ostrich races. Overall, I found the movie to be pretty entertaining, not revolutionary or anything, but fun.My RecommendationPrince of Persia: The Sands of Time is a fun movie, worth seeing in the theater.

Don't get me wrong, there is no room for any kind of thinking when watching it, but I didn't find myself laughing at how lame it all was.I think Disney expects their to be a series of movies, much like Pirates of the Caribbean, but without the acting skills and star power of someone like Johhny Depp, I just don't see it capturing the public's interest like those films did. Plus, pirates are just cooler than princes.The acting is better than I think most would expect. Jake Gyllenhaal is actually quite convincing as an action hero, Ben Kingsley didn't overact like I'm sure he wanted too when attached to a project like this, Gemma Atterton gets more and more beautiful with each movie I've seen her in (Quantum of Solace and Clash of the Titans being the only other two), but the real star of the show is Alfred Molina. He takes what could have been just some forgettable secondary character and turns in a funny performance that adds life to whatever scene he is in. Not Oscar worthy stuff of course, but a character that the audience can't help but cheer on. Jake and Gemma also have decent chemistry.The music has some good desert flavor and the CGI is of the good quality. The action scenes are at least interesting, rather than dull, thanks to Jake's character jumping and flipping around like a circus performer. The story isn't anything special, but it's simple and light enough to please most people of any age. Same goes for the dialogue, but thankfully there is some humor and very little cringe-worthy moments.Is Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time really worthy of 4 out of 5 stars. No, not really. It falls somewhere in between average and good, but for pure entertainment value, 4 seems a bit closer to the truth than 3.Oh and by the way, I couldn't help but put the lyrics to Iron Maiden's ""Hallowed Be Thy Name"" in my title.

Titles such as Clash of the Titans, Prince of Persia, and the A-Team all fell by the wayside as two animated flicks, Toy Story 3, and How To Train Your Dragon, dominated the box office until Inception came out in the summer.  This movie, Prince of Persia, was especially disappointing considering the Disney name, and that it was supposed to be the beginning of Disney's next big franchise after POTC.Well, lets list out what went wrong.  First of, the action scenes were way overblown.  Specifically, the chief protagonist, Prince Dastan, is performing physical feats that would put Jet Li and Jackie Chan blush.  In other words, they were too outlandish to believe.  In fact, this is the first Disney live-action film I know of which features an action hero in the style of Rambo, Bruce Lee, etc.. a normal human being routinely capable of Olympic caliber performances.  Way out of character for a Disney movie.  Second, the movie had an absolutely forgettable soundtrack, which again was a big failing for a Disney movie.  Third, too many characters just looked out of place.  This movie is supposed to be set in Persia, yet all the main characters are played by whites of American or English origin.  Fourth, this movie takes place in Persia, yet it features deserts only seen in North Africa and the Arabian peninsula.  Again, too much of a stretch.  So overall, to fake for my tastes.

But frankly this film put me to sleep. Literally. 'Prince of Persia' displays the same faults that so many effects laden movies transfered from other mediums have. Movies such as this may satisfy the crowd that wants to see it's favorite graphic novel or video game on the big screen, but for the rest of us, it is a big bore. The producers no doubt have satisfied its audience but for the rest of us, those who want story, depth of character, and a thoughtful drama, we have to look elsewhere.'Prince of Persia' makes the mistake that so many of this genre does: The content does not fit the medium. Allow me to explain.The educated film goer wants more out of the film experience than fast cuts, CGI, flashy visuals, loud audio and pseudo 3D. This works fine for mediums like video games and graphic novels, but film is an altogether different experience. 'Prince of Persia' could have been a good film if the producers developed the property as an addition to the mythos of the Prince of Persia video game universe. It could have been an origins tale like 'Batman Begins', or an historical version like 'Pirates of the Caribbean', or a character driven story like 'Iron Man'. But it wasn't. Disney took the easy way out and gave mass audiences what it was most familiar with - a cinematic video game. A film that will make a lot of money but will be forgotten in time. Not a film that you will go back to years from now. Not a film that will be celebrated as a classic of its genre like 'Superman' or the other films I mentioned here.As for the film itself, the buffed up Jake Gyllenhaal looks amazingly like the current  graphic depiction of the main character. He does the character justice. By that I mean he acts like a monotone character out of a video game and that is not necessarily a bad thing. Gemma Arterton's portrayal as Tamina is not very good. It is probably not her fault that her character's behavior is inconsistent and that her lines are terrible. Ben Kingsley is a good as always. You just know that he is evil the first time you see him in this film.The attempt to duplicate the running, jumping, and swinging of the main character of the video game is too  fake CGI to believe. The director tried to duplicate 'parkour', as used the much better films such as Casino Royale' and 'District 13',  but not very successfully.The ending of the film is confusing and bears the mark of writers who did not know how to logically end the story. But I guess it looks good on the big screen.Overall, this film deserves a rental and then pass it on the dustbin of what-might-have-been films.",1,"A sleeper, and I don't mean that in a good way",1286409600,"10 7, 2010",2010,2710,"['lot', 'money', 'went', 'production', 'DID', 'find', 'audience', 'masses', 'who', 'like', 'eye', 'candy', 'frankly', 'film', 'put', 'sleep', 'Literally', ""'Prince"", 'Persia', 'displays', 'same', 'faults', 'so', 'many', 'effects', 'laden', 'movies', 'transfered', 'other', 'mediums', 'have', 'Movies', 'such', 'may', 'satisfy', 'crowd', 'see', 'favorite', 'graphic', 'novel', 'video', 'game', 'big', 'screen', 'rest', 'big', 'bore', 'producers', 'doubt', 'have', 'satisfied', 'audience', 'rest', 'who', 'want', 'story', 'depth', 'character', 'thoughtful', 'drama', 'have', 'look', 'elsewhere', ""'Prince"", 'Persia', 'mistake', 'so', 'many', 'genre', 'content', 'not', 'fit', 'medium', 'Allow', 'explain.The', 'educated', 'film', 'goer', 'more', 'film', 'experience', 'fast', 'cuts', 'CGI', 'flashy', 'visuals', 'loud', 'audio', 'pseudo', '3D', 'fine', 'mediums', 'video', 'games', 'graphic', 'novels', 'film', 'altogether', 'different', 'experience', ""'Prince"", 'Persia', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'film', 'producers', 'developed', 'property', 'addition', 'mythos', 'Prince', 'Persia', 'video', 'game', 'universe', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'origins', 'tale', ""'Batman"", 'Begins', 'historical', 'version', ""'Pirates"", 'Caribbean', 'character', 'driven', 'story', ""'Iron"", 'Man', 'was', ""n't"", 'Disney', 'took', 'easy', 'way', 'gave', 'mass', 'audiences', 'what', 'was', 'most', 'familiar', 'cinematic', 'video', 'game', 'A', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'lot', 'money', 'will', 'be', 'forgotten', 'time', 'Not', 'film', 'will', 'go', 'back', 'years', 'now', 'Not', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'celebrated', 'classic', 'genre', ""'Superman"", 'other', 'films', 'mentioned', 'here.As', 'film', 'buffed', 'up', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'amazingly', 'current', 'graphic', 'depiction', 'main', 'character', 'character', 'justice', 'mean', 'monotone', 'character', 'video', 'game', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'Gemma', 'Arterton', 'portrayal', 'Tamina', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'probably', 'not', 'fault', 'character', 'behavior', 'inconsistent', 'lines', 'are', 'terrible', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'good', 'always', 'just', 'know', 'evil', 'first', 'time', 'see', 'film.The', 'attempt', 'duplicate', 'running', 'jumping', 'swinging', 'main', 'character', 'video', 'game', 'too', 'fake', 'CGI', 'believe', 'director', 'tried', 'duplicate', ""'parkour"", 'used', 'much', 'better', 'films', 'such', 'Casino', 'Royale', '13', 'not', 'very', 'successfully.The', 'ending', 'film', 'confusing', 'mark', 'writers', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'logically', 'end', 'story', 'guess', 'good', 'big', 'screen.Overall', 'film', 'rental', 'then', 'pass', 'dustbin', 'what-might-have-been', 'films']",Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time 2010 Gemma Arterton

1346472,A2T6MYD9VVPMEU,B003IHUI0O,Persian Poetess,"[1, 2]","I have been a long time fan of the Prince of Persia series and am of Persian origin myself.  Before its release I crossed my fingers and hoped that it would deliver an exciting taste of the East to the West as well as honor the Prince of Persia game franchise.  After seeing the film, I walked away with a very doused sense of excitement.  Sure it had enough swashbuckling action to rival Pirates of the Carribean but its scale still seems to fall short of the original Sands of Time tale.The casting should have more or less worked in this film.  Kingsley had done a character of Persian decent in The House of Sand and Fog with minute detail and care.  While there were those out there who claimed that Gyllenhaal is not tan enough to pull off a Persian prince, I do not believe that criticism was valid.  The Persian people were originally an Aryan race and often light skinned.  To this day you will find Iranian citizens with fair skin tones and even blue eyes.  Even the other featured players like Molina were bringing enough to the table to make this work.  Sadly with all the careful consideration made for each character though, they all gave some of the most lackluster performances of their careers.  Everybody just feels like they are joking around and mostly embracing campiness.In regards to the other elements of the film like costuming, locales, and cinematography; I still have the same unimpressed feeling.  Much of the movie cries more of Arabian Nights rather than Prince of Persia.  While the narrator heralds that the Persian empire stretched vast lands including the far reaches of China, all we are given is the same desert scenery.  Even the game broke up the desert feel with lush palace interiors or amazing exotic exteriors.  The camera does do some nice sweeping shots of the desert ironically but was far too rushed and haggard on the action scenes.At the end of the day, this film is pretty much the equivalent of an action B-movie rather than an award worthy epic.  Sitting through it was not a boring affair and the special effects will still grab your attention enough to say ""WOW"".  However, in regards to its adaption of the actual game, it feels much too watered down.  I'm not sure how a sequel will fair at this point as this movie was quite a slow start.  I still remain optimistic though that perhaps Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time 2 might improve on the mistakes of its predecessor and come closer to paying homage to the amazing game its based on.",3,The Prince Takes Flying Leaps on the Screen but Bunny Hops in Terms of the Franchise,1284076800,"09 10, 2010",2010,2496,"['have', 'been', 'long', 'time', 'fan', 'Prince', 'Persia', 'series', 'am', 'Persian', 'origin', 'release', 'crossed', 'fingers', 'hoped', 'would', 'deliver', 'exciting', 'taste', 'East', 'West', 'as', 'well', 'honor', 'Prince', 'Persia', 'game', 'franchise', 'seeing', 'film', 'walked', 'away', 'very', 'doused', 'sense', 'excitement', 'Sure', 'had', 'enough', 'swashbuckling', 'action', 'rival', 'Pirates', 'Carribean', 'scale', 'still', 'fall', 'short', 'original', 'Sands', 'Time', 'tale.The', 'casting', 'should', 'have', 'more', 'less', 'worked', 'film', 'Kingsley', 'had', 'done', 'character', 'Persian', 'decent', 'House', 'Sand', 'Fog', 'minute', 'detail', 'care', 'were', 'who', 'claimed', 'Gyllenhaal', 'not', 'tan', 'enough', 'pull', 'off', 'Persian', 'prince', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'criticism', 'was', 'valid', 'Persian', 'people', 'were', 'originally', 'Aryan', 'race', 'often', 'light', 'skinned', 'day', 'will', 'find', 'Iranian', 'citizens', 'fair', 'skin', 'tones', 'even', 'blue', 'eyes', 'Even', 'other', 'featured', 'players', 'Molina', 'were', 'bringing', 'enough', 'table', 'make', 'work', 'Sadly', 'careful', 'consideration', 'made', 'character', 'gave', 'most', 'lackluster', 'performances', 'careers', 'Everybody', 'just', 'feels', 'are', 'joking', 'around', 'mostly', 'embracing', 'campiness.In', 'regards', 'other', 'elements', 'film', 'costuming', 'locales', 'cinematography', 'still', 'have', 'same', 'unimpressed', 'feeling', 'Much', 'movie', 'more', 'Arabian', 'Nights', 'rather', 'Prince', 'Persia', 'narrator', 'Persian', 'empire', 'stretched', 'vast', 'lands', 'including', 'far', 'China', 'are', 'given', 'same', 'desert', 'scenery', 'Even', 'game', 'broke', 'up', 'desert', 'feel', 'lush', 'palace', 'interiors', 'amazing', 'exotic', 'exteriors', 'camera', 'do', 'nice', 'sweeping', 'shots', 'desert', 'ironically', 'was', 'far', 'too', 'rushed', 'haggard', 'action', 'scenes.At', 'end', 'day', 'film', 'pretty', 'much', 'equivalent', 'action', 'B-movie', 'rather', 'award', 'worthy', 'epic', 'Sitting', 'was', 'not', 'boring', 'affair', 'special', 'effects', 'will', 'still', 'grab', 'attention', 'say', 'WOW', 'However', 'regards', 'adaption', 'actual', 'game', 'much', 'too', 'watered', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'sequel', 'will', 'fair', 'point', 'movie', 'was', 'quite', 'slow', 'start', 'still', 'remain', 'optimistic', 'perhaps', 'Prince', 'Persia', 'Sands', 'Time', '2', 'might', 'improve', 'mistakes', 'predecessor', 'come', 'closer', 'paying', 'homage', 'amazing', 'game', 'based']",Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time 2010 Gemma Arterton

In many ways, it is carried by the two lead characters -- Prince Dastan (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) and Princess Tamina (played by Gemma Arterton) -- and the supporting cast (including Ben Kingsley, whose performance as Dastan's uncle, and Alfred Molina, whose performance as a ""slightly dishonest entrepreneur"", were masterful).The dialog between the Prince and Princess is at times so ""cutsie"" that it ends up cheesy (having heard the original dialog from the game, however, this is a HUGE step up...); but these instances are infrequent, and so not terribly distracting. And, they look good in the roles. Gemma Arterton, with her bronzed skin and henna-dyed hands, is a vision of beauty from ancient legends; and Jake Gyllenhaal, with his buffed physique and ""puppy dog eyes"", is a charming rascal of a warrior prince (as contradictory as it sounds). Arterton convincingly projects a spoiled and sheltered outlook, while Gyllenhaal just as convincingly projects a man who does what he knows is wrong because he's told to do it. Each has their flaws, and each must come to trust the other. And, if you're thinking that love is in the making between the beautiful princess and handsome prince, well...would it happen any other way? (As a side note, Gyllenhaal actually performs a lot of the seemingly impossible stunts -- which was really quite impressive. The commentary on the blu ray is pretty fascinating, if you're interested in that sort of stuff.)As good as the lead actors are however, they are often eclipsed by the supporting cast. Ben Kingsley's performance is phenomenal. Without giving too much away, his role is one of the most complex roles in the film, and Kingsley's acting prowess does not fail him. Watch his facial features throughout...he truly is the somewhat cowardly and yet otherwise bold ""bureaucrat"" that his character is meant to be. Speaking of ""bureaucrats"", Molina's performance -- and his loyal Umbacca (sp?) guard's -- are fantastic. Wayward, greedy, soulless...and yet, drawn to do right by the conscience he no doubt despises (as well as his friend's sense of honor). A perfect performance -- from both men.All in all, this was a good movie. I award it 5/5 stars because it is an excellent film for its genre -- unpretentious, visually spectacular, solid-but-not-overwhelming-story-wise, adventure movies.",5,"Unpretentious, mindless fun",1291507200,"12 5, 2010",2010,2759,"['Prince', 'Persia', 'exactly', 'what', 'would', 'imagine', ""'d"", 'get', 'time-manipulating', 'adventure', 'film', 'made', 'makers', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'fast', 'paced', 'visually', 'enchanting', 'heavy-on-action-light-on-realism', 'adventure', 'movie', '*', 'mild', 'spoilers', '*The', 'story', 'not', 'terribly', 'meaty', 'tried-and-true', 'stuff', 'adventure', 'movies', 'betrayal', 'romance', 'course', 'fighting', 'many', 'ways', 'carried', 'two', 'lead', 'characters', 'Prince', 'Dastan', 'played', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Princess', 'Tamina', 'played', 'Gemma', 'Arterton', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'performance', 'Dastan', 'uncle', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'performance', 'slightly', 'dishonest', 'entrepreneur', 'were', 'masterful', '.The', 'dialog', 'Prince', 'Princess', 'times', 'so', 'cutsie', 'up', 'cheesy', 'having', 'heard', 'original', 'dialog', 'game', 'however', 'HUGE', 'step', 'up', 'instances', 'are', 'infrequent', 'so', 'not', 'terribly', 'distracting', 'look', 'good', 'roles', 'Gemma', 'Arterton', 'bronzed', 'skin', 'henna-dyed', 'hands', 'vision', 'beauty', 'ancient', 'legends', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'buffed', 'physique', 'puppy', 'dog', 'eyes', 'charming', 'rascal', 'warrior', 'prince', 'as', 'contradictory', 'Arterton', 'convincingly', 'projects', 'spoiled', 'sheltered', 'outlook', 'Gyllenhaal', 'just', 'convincingly', 'projects', 'man', 'who', 'what', 'wrong', 'told', 'do', 'flaws', 'must', 'come', 'trust', 'other', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'love', 'making', 'beautiful', 'princess', 'handsome', 'prince', 'well', 'would', 'happen', 'other', 'way', 'side', 'note', 'Gyllenhaal', 'actually', 'lot', 'seemingly', 'impossible', 'stunts', 'was', 'really', 'quite', 'impressive', 'commentary', 'blu', 'ray', 'pretty', 'fascinating', ""'re"", 'interested', 'sort', 'stuff', 'As', 'good', 'lead', 'actors', 'are', 'however', 'are', 'often', 'eclipsed', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'performance', 'phenomenal', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'role', 'one', 'most', 'complex', 'roles', 'film', 'Kingsley', 'acting', 'prowess', 'not', 'fail', 'Watch', 'facial', 'features', 'truly', 'somewhat', 'cowardly', 'yet', 'otherwise', 'bold', 'bureaucrat', 'character', 'meant', 'be', 'Speaking', 'bureaucrats', 'Molina', 'performance', 'loyal', 'Umbacca', 'sp', 'guard', 'are', 'fantastic', 'Wayward', 'greedy', 'soulless', 'yet', 'drawn', 'do', 'right', 'conscience', 'doubt', 'as', 'well', 'friend', 'sense', 'honor', 'perfect', 'performance', 'men.All', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'award', '5/5', 'stars', 'excellent', 'film', 'genre', 'unpretentious', 'visually', 'spectacular', 'solid-but-not-overwhelming-story-wise', 'adventure', 'movies']",Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time 2010 Gemma Arterton

It is fun, exciting, the sets are amazing, the parkour fantastic and most of all Jake Gyllenhal is soooo hot. He is one of my favorite actors, very skillful and normally in deeper more serious roles, so it is clear this one was easy for him. He looks so fit, muscled and lean in this movie and best of all you can tell that he just had a blast making it. In fact everything about this movie screams fun. Clearly, aside from the extras marching in the 125 degree Moroccan desert heat, it appears that everyone involved was caught up in the magic of a wonderful tale wonderfully done. It is not deep but it has a good message, and while there is a lovely romantic story it is not the only story of love. Familial love and love of one's country and culture are also important. The special effects are good too and used sparingly as needed so this is not a CGI movie. In fact the fact that Jake did most of his stunts and Gemma did a lot of hers and that they didn't CGI the parkour makes it a lot better to watch. I really don't like movies where they have to hide the actors face all the time to cover up the stunt double or where the actor leaps from a building and becomes a cartoon character. This has a great story, gorgeous costumes and sets and an excellent cast. Ben Kingsley is a superb actor, slightly wasted in a limited role, but still an asset. I highly recommend this film, it is very enjoyable to watch and will be one of a select few that I watch more than once. I would go into more detail about the film but I feel this is one that was so much fun to watch not knowing anything about the story.

1346484,A3HWLS0TSRHCKH,B003IHUI0O,Rawr2020,"[1, 1]","A few of my friends, die hard Princeo of Persia game fans, advised me not to pick up this movie. With Netflix and my pretty large movie collection I didn't see any reason to own this one, but for reasons I dont even understand (probably cus people kept telling me not to watch it) I picked this up on Blu ray. And all I can say is Im happy that I went against my better judgement and picked this baby up!First and foremost Im not into the games, being a gamer myself I couldnt get into the games. From my perspective PoP looks like it has alot of high flying parkour and the main hero fighting a billion badguys by himself, and a dagger that shifts time. And guess what? This movie has all of that! The storyline is solid and I feel that the characters were surprisingly fleshed out, from the main character to the villain to all the supporting guys. With recent big budget action/fantasy movies it seemed like the pacing was out of whack (i.e. Clash of the Titans) but this movie got it right for the most part.  Overall the movie greatly exceeded my expectations.That being said there are a few things I think could have been improved. First being our hero, I know Jake whatchamacallit looks the part but his acting is something else all together.  No matter what he's in you just cant get attached to the character.  Now we all know theres going to be a sequel since Disney is trying to capture more of the younger male audience and it cant ride the Pirates craze forever so hopefully Jake can get it together next time.  Dont get me wrong he didnt drag my movie experience down but looking at how he's a box office letdown the movie could have probably faired alot better without him.  Secondly I know no one else cared but Im tired of all foreign oriented movies made in the U.S. where everyone has British accents.  Last time I checked i dont think Persians had any contact with Britain during their hey day...>_> Also my final gripe is how the characters kept having to explain key plot points over and over again. I know dastan and tus werent in the same room together when they found out about whatever but WE were so they could have spared us that.Over all this is a good movie and if youre into action/fantasy with some good acting and killer fight scenes (personal favorite was the knife fight at the end that didnt even have dastan..killer stuff) its definitely worth picking up. Usually the newer movies dont get alot of play time on my blu ray player but this one has, and if that says anything its give this one a go and help disney put something other than Pirates out for their live action stuff (Tron aside...)",4,Great movie but could have been better?,1285113600,"09 22, 2010",2010,2629,"['few', 'friends', 'die', 'hard', 'Princeo', 'Persia', 'game', 'fans', 'advised', 'not', 'pick', 'up', 'movie', 'Netflix', 'pretty', 'large', 'movie', 'collection', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'reason', 'own', 'one', 'reasons', 'dont', 'even', 'understand', 'probably', 'cus', 'people', 'kept', 'telling', 'not', 'watch', 'picked', 'up', 'Blu', 'ray', 'can', 'say', 'Im', 'happy', 'went', 'better', 'judgement', 'picked', 'baby', 'up', 'First', 'foremost', 'Im', 'not', 'games', 'being', 'gamer', 'couldnt', 'get', 'games', 'perspective', 'PoP', 'alot', 'high', 'flying', 'parkour', 'main', 'hero', 'fighting', 'billion', 'badguys', 'dagger', 'shifts', 'time', 'guess', 'what', 'movie', 'storyline', 'solid', 'feel', 'characters', 'were', 'surprisingly', 'fleshed', 'out', 'main', 'character', 'villain', 'supporting', 'guys', 'recent', 'big', 'budget', 'action/fantasy', 'movies', 'seemed', 'pacing', 'was', 'whack', 'i.e', 'Clash', 'Titans', 'movie', 'got', 'right', 'most', 'part', 'movie', 'greatly', 'exceeded', 'expectations.That', 'being', 'said', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'improved', 'First', 'being', 'hero', 'know', 'Jake', 'part', 'acting', 'something', 'else', 'together', 'matter', 'what', 'just', 'cant', 'get', 'attached', 'character', 'Now', 'know', 'going', 'be', 'sequel', 'Disney', 'trying', 'capture', 'more', 'younger', 'male', 'audience', 'cant', 'ride', 'Pirates', 'craze', 'forever', 'so', 'hopefully', 'Jake', 'can', 'get', 'together', 'next', 'time', 'Dont', 'get', 'wrong', 'drag', 'movie', 'experience', 'down', 'looking', 'how', 'box', 'office', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'probably', 'faired', 'alot', 'better', 'Secondly', 'know', 'one', 'else', 'cared', 'Im', 'tired', 'foreign', 'oriented', 'movies', 'made', 'U.S.', 'where', 'everyone', 'British', 'accents', 'Last', 'time', 'checked', 'i', 'dont', 'think', 'Persians', 'had', 'contact', 'Britain', 'hey', 'day', '_', '>', 'Also', 'final', 'gripe', 'how', 'characters', 'kept', 'having', 'explain', 'key', 'plot', 'points', 'over', 'again', 'know', 'dastan', 'tus', 'werent', 'same', 'room', 'together', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'WE', 'were', 'so', 'could', 'have', 'spared', 'that.Over', 'good', 'movie', 'youre', 'action/fantasy', 'good', 'acting', 'killer', 'fight', 'scenes', 'personal', 'favorite', 'was', 'knife', 'fight', 'end', 'didnt', 'even', 'have', 'dastan..killer', 'stuff', 'definitely', 'worth', 'picking', 'up', 'Usually', 'newer', 'movies', 'dont', 'get', 'alot', 'play', 'time', 'blu', 'ray', 'player', 'one', 'anything', 'give', 'one', 'go', 'help', 'disney', 'put', 'something', 'other', 'out', 'live', 'action', 'stuff', 'Tron', 'aside']",Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time 2010 Gemma Arterton

Jake Gyllenhaal is no Laurence of Arabia but cuts a swath as a troublesome boy who grows to be a troublesome prince; when others are seriously engaged, he's street-fighting.  When others are telling him not to attack first, he does anyway.  What a brat!It's the typical ""it's OK to undermine authority because it will turn out OK anyway"" mentality and it seems to work in this film.  Jake as the Prince has amazing, almost super-human acrobatic abilities.  He can climb arrows and jump rooftops with the greatest of ease.And never breaks a sweat!Our desert fox (Gemma Arterton), however, the inevitable beautiful Princess, is the holder of a magic dagger that can turn back time for a few minutes thanks to some magic sand which came from some gods which were going to destroy Man but decided to let it go by coming up with the magic sand gimmick and...Yeah, complicated.  But that's OK!The evil uncle who wants it all for himself.  The cast of thousands (of CGI soldiers) who die for the cause.And the eviller (""eviller?"") Hassasins who have these Ninja abilities and throw these spikes from bracelets.  The knife scenes are cool as they fly through the air; the slo-mo jumping and hitting, the swords flashing and the cool desert sunrise.And who knew that ostriches could be so much fun?Ah, the Prince.  Mistaken identity, false accusation.  Works for Hitchcock, not sure about this one, though.As far as fantasy is concerned, it has its requisite beautiful princess, a devil-may-care hero, a bad guy and a quest.

A lot of video games nowadays have well thought out story lines and play out like movies. God of War 3, Red Dead Redemption, Uncharted just to name a few. So my question is, why do writers/directors essentially throw all that out and start from scratch? It's a waste of good material and often adds up to crappy movies. *cough* Silent Hill, Final Fantasy, Resident Evil *cough*Prince of Persia isn't a bad movie...but I certainly wouldn't say it's a good movie. Obviously, it pretty much dismisses the entire premise of the video game, which upsets me, but I was able to stifle that until the credits. What I saw was just kinda...so-so. The action scenes were good, not great. The love story seemed forced, ""Oh I hate you right now...okay now I love you."" And the worst part of all, the Dagger of Time is barely used! I think he used it once to stop her from trying to stab him and then another time he used it to kill snakes. Wow. Seriously? Besides the Delorean, the Dagger of Time is one of the coolest time traveling devices ever and it's used more as a parlor trick than an actual plot point. Which, in the game, it was a very crucial plot point.Then there was all the added fluff. I get it, Disney wants to appeal to children. But Ostrich races? Come on! There were other instances where it seemed like they were just looking to fill 2 hours. Like how they escaped the city and then wandered aimlessly through the desert and were like ""Okay, let's go back to the city now."" I don't know...it just seemed like the whole plot could have been tightened up...but maybe that's just me.Anyways, I apologize for rambling.

Most elements seem to be there, stunning set pieces, a reasonable story premise (although the plot execution let it down), beautiful costumes, impressive parkour style stunts and big budget effects and yet it gets sorely let down in other areas. The story gets so ridiculous in places that it is a film you need to suspend disbelief to truly enjoy it and the acting is pretty wooden from all involved. This is especially disappointing from Gyllenhaal who has acted well in past films and from Molina who acts like a character from Pirates of the Caribbean, with the most ludicrous accent for a man who lives in the middle east (it's more east end!). Towards the end this turns into a weak Indiana Jones wannabe, with a temple of doom and booby traps, but it can never compete. There is also meant to be a romance between Gyllenhaal and Arterton but rarely have I seen such a lack of chemistry between two actors. These aspects, along with the poor plot execution make this a chore to watch and hard to fully enjoy.

Our hero starts out as a street orphan who champions goodness against the Persian army as he jumps around rooftops like the Phantom. However, once he becomes adopted by the king, he loses a lot of personality. He is not as colorful as other leading men in Epic films, mostly due to the writers who gave him lousy lines.What was really missing in this movie outside of exceptional dialogue was humor. I don't mean turn the movie into a comedy, but when you want to be compared to Pirates..., Indian Jones, or other epics such as Star Wars or even the grand daddy of them all LOTR, they all had some comical element in them with leading men that were able to deliver those lines. This movie lacked that human element and it showed as it failed to hook me.In spite of the inability of either the script writers or director to create great characters, the plot, action and scenery were enough to carry the film to where it would be enjoyable. There was one ""joke"" as the princess kept an amulet with the sands of time in it on a necklace located at her cleavage...the last place anyone would look, except maybe Prince Dustin who noticed it right off.Yes, there is a time travel element to it, but it is not really a time travel movie, i.e. it is not bogged down with nerdy time travel paradoxes.

Having played the very first version (yeah, I am over 40) on an IBM 8088 with an orange on black screen and then having played the Sands of Time on PS2 I can say I really like the premise. But good games do not necssarily good movies make. And POP is no exception. (Still it is much better than many other such attempts)It is -as expected- a ""no brains necessary - just use your eyes please"" type movie. And I have no objection to such movies. I actually love them. Not all films need to work on the grey matter. We need movies to flush out the days's stress as well. We do need soap bubbles.My problem is that this is a really big soap bubble. Even as a pure action flick, it failed to raise any interest in me. Everything and everyone is flat. Even the grand action scenes (the siege for example) feel so rushed that excitement wanes before it can take hold of you. Gemma Arterton is nice to look at but wooden - and there is no chemistry between her and the prince.

1346528,AMF52GSX309V0,B003IHUI0O,Tony S.,"[1, 1]","Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time  was awesome! We have all hesitated when hearing about a video game turned movie is announced, but this is an exception. As recently as standing in line for the movie, I Twittered  to the world that I wasn't all that excited about the film. My wife and I were out and about yesterday and decided to see it anyway, and we both loved it. Let me dive right into the likes and dislikes.What I liked about the movie:The ActionMoney obviously attracted Disney to this project, but there's more to it. The action portrayed in the video games made for a very interesting concept on screen. Director Mike Newell does a magnificent job with the action. The chase scenes, the Parkour (wall-jumping), the knife fights, etc. All of the above are shot incredibly well. The pacing of the movie is great; there isn't a dull moment in the film, it's always progressing. Thumbs up to Newell on this.The ActorsAt first I thought to myself, ""Jake Gyllenhaal with an English accent is just not going to work"". Well I stand corrected, and Gyllenhaal is awesome in the lead role. He's physically insane in the movie and demands the spotlight. Gemma Arterton does well in the lead female role, and the chemistry between her and Gyllenhaal is great. They have a tough love thing going that works considering Arterton's role in the film. Alfred Molina gives some amazing comic relief in the movie. Not every joke, but for the most part his role is well played. Then there is Sir Ben Kingsley. At this point in his career, his name says it all. He does well considering he is surrounded by a cast half his age. Just great casting all around in this movie.The Usually ForgottenThe scenery is grand, the sand dunes spectacular and the sets are terrific. The soundtrack is very fitting of a summer blockbuster. As were the costumes and extras. I know I'm gushing about this movie, but really, everything was well done. It has an epic feel to it, until you see the swashbuckling action, it kind of puts it back in perspective. But it has a large scale feel to it.What I didn't like about the movie:The StoryI know it's a Disney film aimed at families, but the story is a bit weak. It was too much of the same thing in different settings (albeit beautiful settings). The trailers pretty much give it away. ""The dagger is important, follow the dagger."" Problem is, and I hate when movies do this, ""he has the dagger, no she has the dagger. No wait, he has the dagger. Wait wait, now that guy over there has the dagger.""

The movie follows prince Dastan (Jake Gyllenhall), the adopted son of King Sharaman (Ronald Pickup). In the aftermath of the invasion of an enemy city, Dastan takes a strange dagger filled with sand as spoils of the war and the city&#8217;s princess Tamina (Gemma Arterton) is captured. Shortly after, Sharaman is murdered and Dastan is framed for the crime by his uncle Nizam (Ben Kengsley). Dastan soon discovers that the sands in dagger allow the user to turn back time for a minute while retaining the knowledge of what happens. Dastan soon discovers his uncle&#8217;s plot to kill him. Dastan flees the city with the princess Tamina. Tamina tells Dastan of the dagger&#8217;s origins and explains what must happen to it to prevent the destruction of the world.In terms of fantasy-action movies, PRINCE OF PERSIA: THE SANDS OF TIME really isn&#8217;t all that bad. The exposition of the dagger is a bit difficult to follow at times, but beyond that the story is a pretty straight-forward fantasy-action movie. There&#8217;s lots of action, some lovable characters, and the typical romance. Alfred Molina has a small bit part in the film, but is one of the more memorable characters. Ben Kingsley is always fun to watch and I think he&#8217;s even better playing villains and anti-heroes than he is at everymen and heroes. Gemma Arterton is beautiful and does a decent job of bringing a little bit of spark to a role that is basically written as nothing more than eye candy. As Dastan, Gyllenhall does a good job and is fairly entertaining to watch. I&#8217;ve never been a Gyllenhall fan, but I actually didn&#8217;t mind that he was the hero in this movie.Although it didn&#8217;t do very well at the domestic box office, the movie did fairly well worldwide and is currently (as of 11/28/13) the highest grossing movie ever based upon a video game. Overall, although there isn&#8217;t a lot that is really memorable about the movie, PRINCE OF PERSIA: THE SANDS OF TIME is a fun flick to watch.  You might not watch it again and again, but you probably won&#8217;t regret having watched it the first time.",3,A Fun Fantasy-Action Flick,1385596800,"11 28, 2013",2013,2319,"['seeing', 'PRINCE', 'OF', 'PERSIA', 'SANDS', 'OF', 'TIME', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'already', 'somewhat', 'familiar', 'general', 'premise', 'story', 'had', 'played', 'couple', 'video', 'games', 'movie', 'based', 'movie', 'prince', 'Dastan', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhall', 'adopted', 'son', 'King', 'Sharaman', 'Ronald', 'Pickup', 'aftermath', 'invasion', 'enemy', 'city', 'Dastan', 'strange', 'dagger', 'filled', 'sand', 'spoils', 'war', 'city', '8217', 'princess', 'Tamina', 'Gemma', 'Arterton', 'captured', 'Shortly', 'Sharaman', 'murdered', 'Dastan', 'framed', 'crime', 'uncle', 'Nizam', 'Ben', 'Kengsley', 'Dastan', 'soon', 'sands', 'dagger', 'allow', 'user', 'turn', 'back', 'time', 'minute', 'retaining', 'knowledge', 'what', 'Dastan', 'soon', 'uncle', '8217', 'plot', 'kill', 'Dastan', 'city', 'princess', 'Tamina', 'Tamina', 'Dastan', 'dagger', '8217', 'origins', 'what', 'must', 'happen', 'prevent', 'destruction', 'world.In', 'terms', 'fantasy-action', 'movies', 'PRINCE', 'OF', 'PERSIA', 'SANDS', 'OF', 'TIME', 'really', 'isn', '8217', 'bad', 'exposition', 'dagger', 'bit', 'difficult', 'follow', 'times', 'story', 'pretty', 'straight-forward', 'fantasy-action', 'movie', '8217', 's', 'lots', 'action', 'lovable', 'characters', 'typical', 'romance', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'small', 'bit', 'part', 'film', 'one', 'more', 'memorable', 'characters', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'always', 'fun', 'watch', 'think', '8217', 's', 'even', 'better', 'playing', 'villains', 'anti-heroes', 'everymen', 'heroes', 'Gemma', 'Arterton', 'beautiful', 'decent', 'job', 'bringing', 'little', 'bit', 'spark', 'role', 'basically', 'written', 'nothing', 'more', 'eye', 'candy', 'Dastan', 'Gyllenhall', 'good', 'job', 'fairly', 'entertaining', 'watch', '8217', 'never', 'been', 'Gyllenhall', 'fan', 'actually', 'didn', '8217', 'mind', 'was', 'hero', 'movie.Although', '8217', 'do', 'very', 'well', 'domestic', 'box', 'office', 'movie', 'did', 'fairly', 'well', 'worldwide', 'currently', '11/28/13', 'highest', 'grossing', 'movie', 'ever', 'based', 'video', 'game', 'Overall', 'isn', '8217', 'lot', 'really', 'memorable', 'movie', 'PRINCE', 'OF', 'PERSIA', 'SANDS', 'OF', 'TIME', 'fun', 'flick', 'watch', 'might', 'not', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'probably', 'won', '8217', 'regret', 'having', 'watched', 'first', 'time']",Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time 2010 Gemma Arterton

Its as if the scenes were based on long-standing Hollywood movies that we all know, so it was very predictable, killed most of the drama. The scenes were just stuck together like pearl beads on a string. No flow, just assumptions that the audience caught the new plot direction without it actually being developed properly in the script. Special effects were poor, not convincing enough, and too few.The Princess falls in love with the bastard Prince of Persia, but its unclear exactly when or why - she just kind of does. I wouldn't recommend this even as a young kid's movie. Definitely won't be any sequels, its just that bad. Don't waste your recession dollars on this Blu-Ray/DVD stinker.Sorry Disney, some people who currently have jobs and produced this stinker need to pray they don't receive pink slips and perhaps you should look for some real talent that already is collecting unemployment that used to make really great movies for you. Kingsley is superb, but limited by the script, Jake is great, the Princess is NOT a raven beauty as the film suggests... the top-shelf actors were subjected to and forced to work with a rotten screenplay, poor directing, poor editing, and poor special effects.

At their heart movies such as Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time are supposed to be fun and adventure filled escapist entertainment. This is where the movie succeeds. First of all the movie is a visual palette of wondrous colors, scenery, architecture, costumes and characters that transports the viewer to another place and time. Secondly the story has all the right elements from heroism, bravery, treachery, betrayal, familial love and loyalty along with romance and laughter. Thirdly the story is epic in scope but intimate in its execution.Based on a video game, which I have never seen, the story follows the adventure of Dastan a Prince of Persia, splendidly portrayed by Jake Gyllenhaal, who had been adopted by the king as a peasant living in poverty on the streets. Raised along with his adopted brothers Dastan leads his brothers and their armies to capture the city of Alamut where he meets the city's beautiful princess Tamina,  portrayed by the enchanting and stunning, Gemma Arterton, and he comes in possession of a mysterious dagger with time traveling abilities.
