I am not sure what was worse: seeing Judge Reinhold's bare backside, or having to listen to his terrible attempt at a southern accent.  The characters here are completely unlikable.

294426,A3I7OX03X6KDMN,6302087392,"Chris Roberts ""Chris Roberts""","[11, 12]","The natural order of the world we live in says that girls want to be domestic and guys want to spread their seed. Often times these biological urges get people into trouble, usually with the guy cheating on the girl (see: Ryan Phillippe). But there is an X factor in that order, and that is that the girl gets bored. This usually happens when the flame goes out in the marriage and the guy focuses his energy on making money while the housewife has little choice but to become desperate. Enter a dangerous artist (Nicolas Cage) into the equation and you have the makings of a domestic melodrama, although in this case it is a fairly good one. The husband in question Thierry (Judge Reinhold) is basically just a Southern suit who has so lost his soul that he has even given up writing. His wife Zandalee (Erika Anderson) is a free spirit who has an encounter with Johnny (Cage) and decides that it is time for an upgrade.The film follows a predictable story arch. The artist is more sexy and interesting than the suit so the girl becomes more and more addicted to him even though she knows it is not in her best interest. Thierry starts off playing dumb, then falls into a sort of militant denial, before deciding that he has to win his wife back. Director Sam Pillsbury has lots of fun playing with these stereotypes, but is ultimately tied to them. That these characters represent caricatures from our daily lives works in providing us with a morality tale, but prevents it from being anything more than a mildly good film. The directing itself is pretty pedestrian as he hits every note every other hack director would have hit had they directed this film. The writing comes and goes, but when it goes it goes down hard. Some lines are so dated and miss by such a wide margin they could have been discards out of Fonzie's playbook. What does put it over the top is all the fun it is having. Niolas Cage gives an inspired, over the top performance looking like an escapee from ""Grease."" We have naked women, a motorboat speeding through the swamps of Louisiana, a tortured artist, Reinhold hamming it up in a miscast role, a rape in a church, and Marisa Tomei sticking her tongue in Nic Cage's ear. How can you say no that?In the end Pillsbury comes out against both Thierry and Johnny, and that is fine but who does that leave the Zandalee's of the world with? By cutting out corporate yes men and tortured artists you are eliminating two of the main types of guys that girls go for. But who really thinks anybody is listening to this film anyways? Just enjoy it for what it is. It may not be anything Tennessee Williams would be proud of, but it is fluffy commercial dreck served up on an appetizing platter. It was made before films were paranoid about offending anybody so be forewarned: If you are afraid of minor violence, open sexuality, or bad screenplays you are urged to stay away. I personally am glad I watched as yet another girl came between yet another set of guys. Now if she could just keep their names straight her life would have turned out so much better. ***1/4",3,Sexual Politics in Pre-Katrina New Orleans,1162684800,"11 5, 2006",2006,3084,"['natural', 'order', 'world', 'live', 'girls', 'want', 'be', 'domestic', 'guys', 'want', 'spread', 'seed', 'Often', 'biological', 'urges', 'get', 'people', 'trouble', 'usually', 'guy', 'cheating', 'girl', 'see', 'Ryan', 'Phillippe', 'X', 'factor', 'order', 'girl', 'bored', 'usually', 'when', 'flame', 'out', 'marriage', 'guy', 'energy', 'making', 'money', 'housewife', 'little', 'choice', 'become', 'desperate', 'Enter', 'dangerous', 'artist', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'equation', 'have', 'makings', 'domestic', 'melodrama', 'case', 'fairly', 'good', 'one', 'husband', 'question', 'Thierry', 'Judge', 'Reinhold', 'basically', 'just', 'Southern', 'suit', 'who', 'so', 'lost', 'soul', 'even', 'given', 'up', 'writing', 'wife', 'Zandalee', 'Erika', 'Anderson', 'free', 'spirit', 'who', 'encounter', 'Johnny', 'Cage', 'time', 'upgrade.The', 'film', 'predictable', 'story', 'arch', 'artist', 'more', 'sexy', 'interesting', 'suit', 'girl', 'more', 'more', 'addicted', 'even', 'not', 'best', 'interest', 'Thierry', 'playing', 'dumb', 'then', 'sort', 'militant', 'denial', 'deciding', 'win', 'wife', 'back', 'Director', 'Sam', 'Pillsbury', 'lots', 'fun', 'playing', 'stereotypes', 'ultimately', 'tied', 'characters', 'represent', 'caricatures', 'daily', 'lives', 'works', 'providing', 'morality', 'tale', 'prevents', 'being', 'anything', 'more', 'mildly', 'good', 'film', 'directing', 'pretty', 'pedestrian', 'note', 'other', 'hack', 'director', 'would', 'have', 'hit', 'had', 'directed', 'film', 'writing', 'when', 'down', 'hard', 'lines', 'are', 'so', 'dated', 'miss', 'such', 'wide', 'margin', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'discards', 'Fonzie', 'playbook', 'What', 'put', 'top', 'fun', 'having', 'Niolas', 'Cage', 'inspired', 'top', 'performance', 'looking', 'escapee', 'Grease', 'have', 'naked', 'women', 'motorboat', 'speeding', 'swamps', 'Louisiana', 'tortured', 'artist', 'Reinhold', 'hamming', 'up', 'miscast', 'role', 'rape', 'church', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'sticking', 'tongue', 'Nic', 'Cage', 'ear', 'How', 'can', 'say', 'end', 'Pillsbury', 'out', 'Thierry', 'Johnny', 'fine', 'who', 'leave', 'Zandalee', 'world', 'cutting', 'out', 'corporate', 'yes', 'men', 'tortured', 'artists', 'are', 'eliminating', 'two', 'main', 'types', 'guys', 'girls', 'go', 'who', 'really', 'anybody', 'listening', 'film', 'Just', 'enjoy', 'what', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'anything', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'would', 'be', 'proud', 'fluffy', 'commercial', 'dreck', 'served', 'up', 'appetizing', 'platter', 'was', 'made', 'films', 'were', 'paranoid', 'offending', 'anybody', 'so', 'be', 'forewarned', 'are', 'afraid', 'minor', 'violence', 'open', 'sexuality', 'bad', 'screenplays', 'are', 'urged', 'stay', 'away', 'personally', 'am', 'glad', 'watched', 'yet', 'girl', 'came', 'yet', 'set', 'guys', 'Now', 'could', 'just', 'keep', 'names', 'straight', 'life', 'would', 'have', 'turned', 'out', 'so', 'much', 'better', '***1/4']",N/A

Hayes ""bibliophile""","[0, 0]","One-time poet Thierry Martin (Judge Reinhold) has traded his pen to live the corporate life in his father's stead, after his father's death. Unfortunately, the stress has left him unable to cope with the needs of his sexy wife Zandalee (Erika Anderson). When Thierry renews his friendship with wild-child artist Johnny Collins (Nic Cage), &lt;lj-cut text=""can trouble be far behind?"">Synopsis:Zandalee is set against the backdrop of New Orleans, where Zandalee works in the dress shop of Thierry's grandmother Tatt (Viveca Lindfors). Zandalee is restless, and yearns to have the man she married back again--the poet who inflamed her with his words. Physically frustrated, she falls into a relationship with Johnny, telling herself that it's only sex. At a dinner party given for Tatta and her long time lover, she and Johnny do it in the laundry room, while her husband sits nearby.The more it continues, the more torn Zandalee is between her love for her husband, and her desire for Johnny, and it becomes harder and harder to reconcile the two. She urges Thierry to take her away, find time for them to be alone together. By now he more than suspects what is going on, and is helpless to do anything about it. He takes her to the bayou, and tells Johnny where they're going, with tragic consequences.Commentary:This is pretty vintage Nic Cage, and he certainly doesn't hold back in any way in his portrayal of the bohemian artist who lives by his own rules, and takes what he wants. There is one scene that is very over the top Nic in one of his trademark meltdowns. Johnny doesn't like to be told what to do, or who to do it with. And he doesn't care who he hurts. I found Zandalee to be obnoxious and selfish. The person I felt most sorry for was Thierry. His own weakness proved to be his fatal flaw.It's an interesting film, worth watching, mostly for Nic and Judge Reinhold. I wasn't  particularly impressed with Erika Anderson's performance. Viveca Lindfors as Tatta was good. Look for some interesting cameos--Steve Buscemi working on a garbage truck; Marisa Tomei as one of Johnny's women; and Joe Pantoliano as a cross-dresser who frequents Zandalee's shop. I think his was the most interesting character of all.Good scenery, both inside New Orleans, and on the bayou.
