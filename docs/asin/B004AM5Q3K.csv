1393688,A3CSCNUKKKTK6G,B004AM5Q3K,Cameron Chase,"[1, 2]","The story of a singer/comedian who comes to Los Angeles to seek his fortune, and his account during his brief stay there.  Henry Phillips sings folk songs that are not really folksy with lyrics that are impossible to sing along to.  People who prefer Curb Your Enthusiasm over Seinfeld may appreciate the humor in this indie film.  It's not a laugh a minute, because there's actually some kind of story involved here. But I found myself actually falling back in my swivel chair and laughing hard during some scenes.  The humor is based on character and awkward situations.  The way Henry Phillips gets mischaracterized as an anti-semitic folk singer reminds me of the best parts of Curb Your Enthusiasm.  There are also some ususual characters that remind me of the offbeat Life and Times of Tim.  Henry is a sort of everyman placed into weird and uncomfortable situations.  This is not sitcomy Steve Carroll humor - it's subtle, intelligent, ironic and politically incorrect.",5,Indie comedy for the Curb crowd,1321142400,"11 13, 2011",2011,976,"['story', 'singer/comedian', 'who', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'seek', 'fortune', 'account', 'brief', 'stay', 'there', 'Henry', 'Phillips', 'sings', 'folk', 'songs', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'folksy', 'lyrics', 'are', 'impossible', 'sing', 'along', 'People', 'who', 'prefer', 'Curb', 'Your', 'Enthusiasm', 'Seinfeld', 'may', 'appreciate', 'humor', 'indie', 'film', 'not', 'laugh', 'minute', 'actually', 'kind', 'story', 'involved', 'here', 'found', 'actually', 'falling', 'back', 'swivel', 'chair', 'laughing', 'hard', 'scenes', 'humor', 'based', 'character', 'awkward', 'situations', 'way', 'Henry', 'Phillips', 'mischaracterized', 'anti-semitic', 'folk', 'singer', 'best', 'parts', 'Curb', 'Your', 'Enthusiasm', 'are', 'also', 'ususual', 'characters', 'remind', 'offbeat', 'Life', 'Times', 'Tim', 'Henry', 'sort', 'everyman', 'placed', 'weird', 'uncomfortable', 'situations', 'not', 'sitcomy', 'Steve', 'Carroll', 'humor', 'subtle', 'intelligent', 'ironic', 'politically', 'incorrect']",Punching the Clown

I have no doubt that making it in show business can involve pestering 99 people until that hundredth comes along that can get you to the next venue.

1393695,A2ZL07Y7FE7W3S,B004AM5Q3K,Thomas E. Davis,"[1, 1]","A side-splitting blend of dead-on satire and music, this film exposes every performer's nightmare. Comedian Henry Phillips plays a mocking version of himself: an unknown folk singer-songwriter, mortifying nightclub act, and perennial failure. Living on the road but running out of luck and money, he arrives in Los Angeles to crash with his loser brother (Matthew Walker), meets a bumbling agent (Ellen Ratner), and falls into the shallow end of the entertainment scene (there is apparently no deep end).Through a series of chance encounters with pretentious phonies, vicious backstabbers, and vacuous rumormongers in the music biz and the media, Henry's fortunes undergo a sudden rise (he signs a recording contract) and even more precipitous fall (he's pilloried as a racist). The storyline is punctuated by awkward attempts at romance, humiliating miscommunications with nearly everyone, and a unique form of standup comedy. Henry's intros are just as funny as his songs, whose hilariously caustic and subversively confessional lyrics belie his meek, earnest demeanor.I laughed throughout the movie, enjoying the absurdity of the situations and the hapless people in them. If you're a fan of Louis CK, Sarah Silverman, Curb Your Enthusiasm, and especially Flight of the Conchords, you really must see it.",5,Painfully funny,1377129600,"08 22, 2013",2013,1307,"['side-splitting', 'blend', 'dead-on', 'satire', 'music', 'film', 'performer', 'nightmare', 'Comedian', 'Henry', 'Phillips', 'mocking', 'version', 'unknown', 'folk', 'singer-songwriter', 'mortifying', 'nightclub', 'act', 'perennial', 'failure', 'Living', 'road', 'running', 'luck', 'money', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'crash', 'loser', 'brother', 'Matthew', 'Walker', 'bumbling', 'agent', 'Ellen', 'Ratner', 'shallow', 'end', 'entertainment', 'scene', 'apparently', 'deep', 'end', 'series', 'chance', 'encounters', 'pretentious', 'phonies', 'vicious', 'backstabbers', 'vacuous', 'rumormongers', 'music', 'biz', 'media', 'Henry', 'fortunes', 'undergo', 'sudden', 'rise', 'signs', 'recording', 'contract', 'even', 'more', 'precipitous', 'fall', 'pilloried', 'racist', 'storyline', 'punctuated', 'awkward', 'attempts', 'romance', 'humiliating', 'miscommunications', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'unique', 'form', 'standup', 'comedy', 'Henry', 'intros', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'funny', 'songs', 'hilariously', 'caustic', 'subversively', 'confessional', 'lyrics', 'belie', 'meek', 'earnest', 'demeanor.I', 'laughed', 'movie', 'enjoying', 'absurdity', 'situations', 'hapless', 'people', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Louis', 'CK', 'Sarah', 'Silverman', 'Curb', 'Your', 'Enthusiasm', 'especially', 'Flight', 'Conchords', 'really', 'must', 'see']",Punching the Clown
