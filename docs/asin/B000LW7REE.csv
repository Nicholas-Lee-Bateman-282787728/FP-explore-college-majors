E Jackson,"[3, 4]","It's true Kathy Bates is one of my favorite actresses ever, but the main reason the Family That Preys is so good is actually not so much about Kathy Bates but moreso because of the *rest* of the characters and storyline.It's one of those storylines where, if you can find a way to pay attention to the first 30 minutes (which is definitely on the dull side) the rest of the storyline will gradually improve more and more all the way to the conclusion, which is where all the events you witness during the first half unravel and make sense.It's actually a carefully written and well-executed storyline.  Whoever wrote this storyline did a magnificent job, seriously.Without spoiling anything, the story is about several family members and friends who go through many personal problems involving significant business decisions, relationship troubles, and Kathy Bates character getting an urge to travel around the country with her friend, see the sights and just enjoy life.What makes the storyline so memorable is, once again, the way everything ties together by the end.Another interesting thing about the storyline is how it's actually a perfect blend of comedy and drama, not to mention plenty of noticeably tense and sad moments.  Implementing all these emotions would have been good enough to give the movie a high grade- the fact the storyline is so cleverly written just makes it that much better.

And I didn't think that was possible.These two were the central characters in this story and they didn't pull off the marriage, the marriage problems, or the big reveal. Lathan as the wife was too flatly self-centered, to the point of being evil--too much so to be remotely believable. And, the husband was too innocent and unaware to be a teenage boy much less a full grown man.The story was worth telling, but it was told badly. Tyler Perry is NOT an expert film maker, so I usually don't critique him that hard. He's telling OUR stories with OUR music and caricatures of OUR people AND he's in a learning process going from church plays to film. But this movie was a dud, worse than a dud because...Worse than ALL OF THIS: There is NO JUSTIFICATION for a man just hauling off and hitting a woman. I'd have had a hard time with that if the characters devolved into a fist fight. And that's not what happened. The husband (simple-minded as he was) simply becomes outraged and hits the wife.

The real stars of this movie are the veteran, professional trained actors, but I always like to see TP without any makeup or costumes, because he does seems to have A LOT of unexplored depth as a dramatic actor.  Plus, he always comes off as super masculine/strong/sensitive/intelligent and caring whenever he's playing a regular character.

All of the other characters were two dimensional and stereotypical, instead of one dimensional.  The Christian character, came off as mauldlin, spaced out, stupid and silly instead of comical, while traveling with her friend. What was the basis for their friendship? How would a business woman graduating at the top of her class put her cash in the bank where her husband would find it? And then leave the money in the bank after her husband found out? A woman who is gaining that kind of cash and perks from her married lover, whom is also the father of her child, would have left her never loved and repected husband, if she even ever married the poor sap in the first place, with her attitudes. And most women today wouldn't give a hill of beans if her lover left his wife or not. In fact, if she had her own career and was satified with the man, she would rather he stay with his wife, so she could maintain her independent and kept life style. ""It's cheaper to keep her"". All in all, the movie was sophomoric soap opera, about still taboo and little understood issues. Also, I didn't care for the implcation that the (SMART?) WEALTHY WHITE MATRON COMMITTED SUICIDE!!**##!!!?!? Who paid off for that wicked social engineering suggestion?  After the wealthy white matron died and left Alice her Cadillac, why did Alice close her shop and leave both her and her dead friends's mutual grandchild and and ride ofF into the sunset: to do what, stick cash into men's drawers?I certainly don't begrudge Tyler Perry's great success. I enjoyed the stage version of Madea's Family Reunion. I do believe that play was a gift from God. However, this movie didn't edify me one bit. This movie may have even been damaging to the understanding of real social/sexual politics between black men and woman as well as in interacial relationships today. This film presented no good examples of Christian, Mother or Friend. If Alice really loved her friend who made her a wealthy woman to boot, she would have vowed to take care of her, herself, until her friend's dying day. Not just say ""I'ts gon be alright"" but assure her that she was going to make it alright with real love, care and dignity, honor and respect for her friend's LIFE.

1041082,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B000LW7REE,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[5, 6]","Alfre Woodard and Kathy Bates are two of the most underappreciated, powerful actresses in film today. I cannot say that enough, and the proof is I haven't reviewed a single Kathy Bates film and only one Alfre Woodard film that I can recall (DOWN IN THE DELTA).Tyler Perry's THE FAMILY THAT PREYS is beautifully dominated by these two beautiful women, both of whom play strong, independent mothers. This seems to be a subject close to Perry's heart of hearts, and he does it better than any director.This will be short and sweet, because this film is a classic. Perry has his weak spots as a director--such as his occasionally confusing stories and his indecision about how to anchor a film--but THE FAMILY has none of that. This dramatic masterpiece is the story of family ties, betrayals and a ruthless pragmatism (only Perry could manage a film that merits the latter description).What I love best in this film is its Hitchcockian flavor--and no, it is not a chilling suspense film. In fact, Perry whacks his audiences over the head fantastically in ways Hitchcock could not. Perry writes about life. Hitchcock baked cinematic cakes.There is no Madea in this film, though Perry has a supporting role (his fake hair is disappointing, or at least it looks fake). This is all nitty gritty, and not the usual grinding ghetto stories we see too often. This has the power and drama that proves Tyler Perry is color blind--to the betterment of his true inner vision.In this film there is no division imposed on any character, black or white. Only the divisions that we all know too well, that should no longer exist. They do exist, and this story is part of that tale, too.

Everyone in this movie are extremely convincing actors, and that is one of the most prominent keys to a good movie. Another prominent key is the script. Well this script is also very very good. They did a great job executing the plot and molding the characters and not making the ending predictable. There are a few curveballs that will have you wanting to know what is going to happen next.Sanaa Lathan does an excellent job portraying the antagonist corporate businesswoman as Andrea (you will dislike her character though but that only speaks volumes of her superb acting in this film). Taraji also does exceptional as Sanaa's more down to earth yet sassy sister, Pam. Mr Perry plays Pam's blue-collar husband, Ben. Speaking of husbands, Rockmond Dunbar plays Sanaa's naive yet sweet husband Chris. Robin Givens also shows that she can play the clever underdog without going too far over the top and she succeeds.Kathy Bates and Cole Hauser's chemistry as the wealthy mother & son Cartwright duo also make this movie more than worthwhile. As I stated before, it is the exceptional acting & script that will make you enjoy this movie thoroughly. Perry's film making skills (and his acting) have greatly improved here, this is his most stellar and polished movie to date.

Kathy Baker and Alfre Woodard cant be beat in much of anything.

It is just a pleasant watching Baker and Woodard go thru their paces and I thought that the dementia was handled in a pretty non sentimental way though none the less horrifying when it afflicts anyone.

1041087,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B000LW7REE,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[0, 1]","THE FAMILY THAT PREYSI have to say that I am a big fan of Tyler Perry and all of his work from the plays to films I like what the man does. It seems that he just keeps getting better as his film making abilities progress with every one. Some I like more than others but every one has been outstanding, to me Tyler writes people not characters and that is the best complement I can give. So needless to say I was excited to hear that my favorite actress Kathy Bates was doing a film with him, and it got better when I learned that Alfre Woodard was in it.The film is about two best friends Charlotte Cartwright [Bates] & Alice Pratt [Woodard] who both live very different lives but it is those lives that have made them the friends they are today. Both have kids each having their own problems whether it be with money or marriages yet they all seem to be connected and not just because of the mothers being friends. So in order to get away from it all they both get together and travel across America for one last good time together, because like Charlotte says ""are you living or existing"". In the mean time Alice's two daughters are trying to deal with each and their husbands at the same time. One has an ambitious husband who just wants to catch a break and the other has a husband who is content on were he is in life while wants more. As far as Charlotte's child goes he is busy scheming and planning on getting his mother dropped from the company. A company in which she has made one of the best in the world and has the controlling vote, unless he can trick her out of it.Tyler Perry has crafted another hit in my mind and has created one of my favorite films to come out these last couple of years. His script is full of wonderful and interesting characters some are more likable than others but all are entertaining. His direction seems crisp as ever as the pace moves along nicely never staying to long on any one scene, but all play out smooth and don't go to quick. Perry is excellent in his role as Ben as well the content husband of Pam played wonderfully by one of the best actresses alive Taraji Henson. Perry comes across as the every man who is just trying to get by in life and feed his family and Taraji is perfect as the supportive wife who just wants her husband to want more in life.Kathy Bates as always is magnificent as Charlotte Cartwright the millionaire or is it billionaire, whatever she is she is excellent. She pulls off the character nicely and the scenes between her and Alfre Woodard are excellent especially when her disease starts to get to her. And Alfre Woodard is marvelous as Alice Pratt the the best friend who came from a whole other world but befriended who should have been an enemy, there is a nice surprise in the end. Sanaa Lathan is one of the best in the film as Andrea the wicked sister of Pam or at least in Pam's eyes. She is cold and calculating in this film and knocks it out of the park. Rockmond Dunbar plays her ambitious husband Chris and much like the rest of the cast is nothing short of great. He just seems like a genuinely nice guy although a lot of people seem to be upset with something that happens with him [more on that latter]. Cole Hauser plays possibly the most entertaining character as Charlotte's son William since he plays the character so evil. And KaDee Strickland is great as his wife Jillian as is Robin Givens as Abby. Another superb stand out is Sebastian Siegel playing Nick, excellent character here.Now as far as the little thing that every one seems up set about I must say just get over, it is a movie and that is the character. I certainly don't agree with ever striking a woman no matter what the reason and don't agree with him doing it. But his character was pushed to the edge with what she had done to him and that was the only way that character knew how to respond. Although he was wrong for just taking the money even though they were married. I really think that it added a nice element of drama to the scene and made them seem more real. There are plenty of real life situations that ended just like that and I think that is all it was, just a scene from real life because like I said Tyler writes people not characters in these kinds of films. I mean come on it is really a drama you should expect things like that, you don't go see a Slasher flick and then say ""THAT WAS SO RUDE OF HIM TO STAB HER IN THE SHOWER, HE COULDN'T WAIT""This is an excellent movie that is worthy of any DVD collection in my opinion, I am a proud owner of it. At the very least it is a very entertaining film about people, and real people at that. I think you should buy this and skip a rental it is definitely worth shelling out for.",5,TYLER PERRY + KATHY BATES HOW COULD THIS NOT BE GOOD,1237507200,"03 20, 2009",2009,4710,"['FAMILY', 'THAT', 'PREYSI', 'have', 'say', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'work', 'plays', 'films', 'what', 'man', 'just', 'getting', 'better', 'film', 'making', 'abilities', 'progress', 'one', 'more', 'others', 'one', 'been', 'outstanding', 'Tyler', 'people', 'not', 'characters', 'best', 'complement', 'can', 'give', 'So', 'needless', 'say', 'was', 'excited', 'hear', 'favorite', 'actress', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'was', 'doing', 'film', 'got', 'better', 'when', 'learned', 'Alfre', 'Woodard', 'was', 'it.The', 'film', 'two', 'best', 'friends', 'Charlotte', 'Cartwright', '[', 'Bates', ']', 'Alice', 'Pratt', '[', 'Woodard', ']', 'who', 'live', 'very', 'different', 'lives', 'lives', 'have', 'made', 'friends', 'are', 'today', 'have', 'kids', 'having', 'own', 'problems', 'be', 'money', 'marriages', 'yet', 'seem', 'be', 'connected', 'not', 'just', 'mothers', 'being', 'friends', 'So', 'order', 'get', 'away', 'get', 'together', 'travel', 'America', 'one', 'last', 'good', 'time', 'together', 'Charlotte', 'are', 'living', 'existing', 'mean', 'time', 'Alice', 'two', 'daughters', 'are', 'trying', 'deal', 'husbands', 'same', 'time', 'One', 'ambitious', 'husband', 'who', 'just', 'catch', 'break', 'other', 'husband', 'who', 'content', 'were', 'life', 'more', 'As', 'far', 'Charlotte', 'child', 'busy', 'scheming', 'planning', 'getting', 'mother', 'dropped', 'company', 'company', 'made', 'one', 'best', 'world', 'controlling', 'vote', 'can', 'trick', 'it.Tyler', 'Perry', 'crafted', 'hit', 'mind', 'created', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'come', 'out', 'last', 'couple', 'years', 'script', 'full', 'wonderful', 'interesting', 'characters', 'are', 'more', 'likable', 'others', 'are', 'entertaining', 'direction', 'crisp', 'as', 'ever', 'pace', 'along', 'nicely', 'never', 'staying', 'long', 'one', 'scene', 'play', 'out', 'smooth', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'quick', 'Perry', 'excellent', 'role', 'as', 'Ben', 'well', 'content', 'husband', 'Pam', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'one', 'best', 'actresses', 'alive', 'Taraji', 'Henson', 'Perry', 'man', 'who', 'just', 'trying', 'get', 'life', 'feed', 'family', 'Taraji', 'perfect', 'supportive', 'wife', 'who', 'just', 'husband', 'want', 'more', 'life.Kathy', 'Bates', 'always', 'magnificent', 'Charlotte', 'Cartwright', 'millionaire', 'billionaire', 'excellent', 'character', 'nicely', 'scenes', 'Alfre', 'Woodard', 'are', 'excellent', 'especially', 'when', 'disease', 'get', 'Alfre', 'Woodard', 'marvelous', 'Alice', 'Pratt', 'best', 'friend', 'who', 'came', 'whole', 'other', 'world', 'befriended', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'enemy', 'nice', 'surprise', 'end', 'Sanaa', 'Lathan', 'one', 'best', 'film', 'Andrea', 'wicked', 'sister', 'Pam', 'least', 'Pam', 'eyes', 'cold', 'calculating', 'film', 'knocks', 'park', 'Rockmond', 'Dunbar', 'ambitious', 'husband', 'Chris', 'much', 'rest', 'cast', 'nothing', 'short', 'great', 'just', 'genuinely', 'nice', 'guy', 'lot', 'people', 'seem', 'be', 'upset', 'something', '[', 'more', 'latter', ']', 'Cole', 'Hauser', 'possibly', 'most', 'entertaining', 'character', 'Charlotte', 'son', 'William', 'character', 'so', 'evil', 'KaDee', 'Strickland', 'great', 'wife', 'Jillian', 'Robin', 'Givens', 'Abby', 'superb', 'stand', 'out', 'Sebastian', 'Siegel', 'playing', 'Nick', 'excellent', 'character', 'here.Now', 'as', 'far', 'little', 'thing', 'one', 'up', 'set', 'must', 'say', 'just', 'get', 'over', 'movie', 'character', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'ever', 'striking', 'woman', 'matter', 'what', 'reason', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'doing', 'character', 'was', 'pushed', 'edge', 'what', 'had', 'done', 'was', 'only', 'way', 'character', 'knew', 'how', 'respond', 'was', 'wrong', 'just', 'taking', 'money', 'even', 'were', 'married', 'really', 'think', 'added', 'nice', 'element', 'drama', 'scene', 'made', 'seem', 'more', 'real', 'are', 'plenty', 'real', 'life', 'situations', 'ended', 'just', 'think', 'was', 'just', 'scene', 'real', 'life', 'said', 'Tyler', 'people', 'not', 'characters', 'kinds', 'films', 'mean', 'come', 'really', 'drama', 'should', 'expect', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'see', 'Slasher', 'flick', 'then', 'say', 'WAS', 'SO', 'RUDE', 'OF', 'HIM', 'TO', 'STAB', 'HER', 'IN', 'THE', 'SHOWER', 'HE', 'COULD', ""N'T"", 'WAIT', 'excellent', 'movie', 'worthy', 'DVD', 'collection', 'opinion', 'am', 'proud', 'owner', 'very', 'least', 'very', 'entertaining', 'film', 'people', 'real', 'people', 'think', 'should', 'buy', 'skip', 'rental', 'definitely', 'worth', 'shelling', 'out']",N/A
1041088,A1LNH5Z5IRSGM6,B000LW7REE,Gayle Tiller,"[1, 2]","I really enjoyed watching the duo of Charlotte Cartwright played by Kathy Bates and Alice Pratt played by Alfre Woodard. Charlotte is rich, the controlling shareholder of a publicly-traded company and wild when it comes to life. Alice is working class, owns a small diner and is deeply religious.Their trip across country was hilarious. I loved the scene in which the deeply religious Alice sprays holy water on a male stripper ""to save him;"" whereas, Charlotte eagerly gives dollars to a dancing male stripper on stage.Sanaa Lathan superbly plays Andrea who is the married daughter of Alice Pratt. She has an Ivy league education and an attitude of entitlement. She's power hungry and she will do anything to get ahead including sleeping with her married boss William Cartwright.Cole Hauser skillfully plays William Cartwright who is the only child of Charlotte. He has no respect for his mother and his goal is take over the company at any price. The chemistry between Hauser and Lathan was quite convincing. Their ruthlessness permeates throughout their affair. They only care about money, power and pure gratification.The one gaping hole in the plot is that despite the numerous clues that Andrea's husband is given about his wife's affair, he completely ignores them. It makes no sense. And it makes him appear to be very stupid and weak. This part of the script should have been reworked to make it more realistic.I also missed the Madea character that Tyler has had present in many of his other films. I also didn't understand why Tyler wore a fake afro in his role as the brother-in-law of Andrea. It took away from his character.

While this was a very good movie, I feel ""Why Did I Get Married"" was much better. Tyler Perry's dramatic movies are more enjoyable because they do not contain the usual stereotypes that his comedies contained, i.e. Madea. I agree with a lot of the reviews that Alfre Woodard and Kathy Bates were both excellent in this movie.I really didn't like Sanaa Latham playing the villianess, I would have preferred Robin Givens in that role. I really felt bad for Andrea's husband Chris. I think TP portrayed him as too weak and too apologhetic when he had nothing to apologize for. Now that I think about it, the women characters were much stronger than the men characters. I'm so glad that Andrea was left with nothing for all her misdeeds.

Tyler Perry has a gift for keeping his stories real and heartfelt, and always throws wonderful nuggets of wisdom and truth in his movies.Alfre Woodward's character was a beautiful example of a woman with a true Christian heart. No hypocrisy, and her scenes rebuking with the holy oil and the bible were laugh out loud funny. The acting was top notch by all the performers ( Robin Givens gives a fine performance as well, I always think she is unfairly judged.)

Granted, compared to the majority of his movies that I have seen, this one is probably the best of a mediocre mix, but that doesn't make it worthwhile.This time out, you have two family matriarchs, portrayed by two very talented actors, Alfre Woodward and Kathy Bates, from appreciatively distinct social, cultural and economic backgrounds who have nevertheless forged what appears to be a committed friendship over nearly 30 years.  Alice, Woodward's character is the `salt of the earth,' deeply religious, forgiving and non-judgmental which is fortunate since she is also the mother of a manipulative, self-absorbed thirty-something daughter (Sanaa Lathan) who is willing to do whatever she deems necessary to achieve her aspirations of upward mobility, including emasculation of her ambitious but patently nave husband (Rockmond Dunbar) by entering into an adulterous relationship with her employer (Cole Hauser) who conveniently also happens to be the back-stabbing, self-serving son of  Bates' character, Charlotte.It is feasible that Perry intended to subtly comment on historical objectification of Black women by white oppressors because Cartwright, at his lecherous best also shows more than passing interest in Robin Given's character, a no nonsense COO brought into the company by his mother as direct threat to her son's quest to usurp the corporate chairperson position, but that's way more credit than I am willing to proffer.Also in the recipe there are the strong-willed, family oriented yet curiously childless other Woodward daughter (Taraji P. Henson), wife of the grounded, dedicated hard-working, secure in life, Ben (Tyler Perry), and the introverted, non-confrontational wife (KaDee Strickland) of  Houser's character... and a homeless guy. It is made clear Charlotte doesn't trust or conceivably even like her son and she has no use for her ex-trailer trash parvenu daughter-in-law. It's a mystery to me why these two women, (Charlotte and Alice) are friends because although how they met is eventually brought to light, the friendship does not appear to have been particularly deep or reciprocal. Alice seems to know a great deal about Charlotte and her travails in life but at the same time, Charlotte isn't even aware Alice is a teetotaler.Those factors and many others are revealed during  the girl buddy road trip Charlotte convinces Alice to take with her in a classic Coupe Deville, leaving the foibles of the homefront to take care of themselves, one of which is the nave husband trying to get funding from his employer (and his wife's lover) to start his own construction company, when it seems to me, unless one was cognizant of his spouse's intimacy with the potential benefactor, playing upon his mother-in-law's relationship with Charlotte, the actual owner of corporation, would have been a better course of action, or maybe applying for an SBA loan. I'm not even going to address why Lathan's character who clearly had little respect for her husband and is supposed to be a financial expert would choose to place her slush fund in a joint account. Those are at the bottom of the this doesn't make sense totem pole but to mention the more confounding issues would probably constitute spoilers.In the end, this is a typical Perry movie. If his work has entertained in the past or if you're looking for a movie with an ostensibly uplifting message that in reality will not survive any contemplative scrutiny, you're in the right place. So, my five star rating is measured against other Perry films, not a wide range of films of similar plotlines, where my real assessment would be two stars.",5,"I know, it's me, not Tyler Perry",1248480000,"07 25, 2009",2009,3822,"['also', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'putting', 'out', 'exactly', 'type', 'superficial', 'movies', 'will', 'not', 'stand', 'up', 'amount', 'incisive', 'consideration', 'will', 'appeal', 'targeted', 'audience', 'Granted', 'compared', 'majority', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'one', 'probably', 'best', 'mediocre', 'mix', ""n't"", 'make', 'worthwhile.This', 'time', 'out', 'have', 'two', 'family', 'matriarchs', 'portrayed', 'two', 'very', 'talented', 'actors', 'Alfre', 'Woodward', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'appreciatively', 'distinct', 'social', 'cultural', 'economic', 'backgrounds', 'who', 'have', 'nevertheless', 'forged', 'what', 'be', 'committed', 'friendship', 'nearly', '30', 'years', 'Alice', 'Woodward', 'character', 'salt', 'earth', 'deeply', 'religious', 'forgiving', 'non-judgmental', 'fortunate', 'also', 'mother', 'manipulative', 'self-absorbed', 'thirty-something', 'daughter', 'Sanaa', 'Lathan', 'who', 'willing', 'do', 'necessary', 'achieve', 'aspirations', 'upward', 'mobility', 'including', 'emasculation', 'ambitious', 'patently', 'nave', 'husband', 'Rockmond', 'Dunbar', 'entering', 'adulterous', 'relationship', 'employer', 'Cole', 'Hauser', 'who', 'conveniently', 'also', 'be', 'back-stabbing', 'self-serving', 'son', 'Bates', 'character', 'Charlotte.It', 'feasible', 'Perry', 'intended', 'subtly', 'comment', 'historical', 'objectification', 'Black', 'women', 'white', 'oppressors', 'Cartwright', 'lecherous', 'best', 'also', 'more', 'passing', 'interest', 'Robin', 'Given', 'character', 'nonsense', 'COO', 'brought', 'company', 'mother', 'direct', 'threat', 'son', 'quest', 'usurp', 'corporate', 'chairperson', 'position', 'way', 'more', 'credit', 'am', 'willing', 'proffer.Also', 'recipe', 'are', 'strong-willed', 'family', 'oriented', 'yet', 'curiously', 'childless', 'other', 'Woodward', 'daughter', 'Taraji', 'P.', 'Henson', 'wife', 'grounded', 'dedicated', 'hard-working', 'secure', 'life', 'Ben', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'introverted', 'non-confrontational', 'wife', 'KaDee', 'Strickland', 'Houser', 'character', 'homeless', 'guy', 'made', 'clear', 'Charlotte', ""n't"", 'trust', 'conceivably', 'even', 'son', 'use', 'ex-trailer', 'trash', 'parvenu', 'daughter-in-law', 'mystery', 'why', 'two', 'women', 'Charlotte', 'Alice', 'are', 'friends', 'how', 'met', 'eventually', 'brought', 'light', 'friendship', 'not', 'appear', 'have', 'been', 'particularly', 'deep', 'reciprocal', 'Alice', 'know', 'great', 'deal', 'Charlotte', 'travails', 'life', 'same', 'time', 'Charlotte', ""n't"", 'even', 'aware', 'Alice', 'teetotaler.Those', 'factors', 'many', 'others', 'are', 'revealed', 'girl', 'buddy', 'road', 'trip', 'Charlotte', 'Alice', 'take', 'classic', 'Coupe', 'Deville', 'leaving', 'foibles', 'homefront', 'take', 'care', 'one', 'nave', 'husband', 'trying', 'get', 'funding', 'employer', 'wife', 'lover', 'start', 'own', 'construction', 'company', 'when', 'one', 'was', 'cognizant', 'spouse', 'intimacy', 'potential', 'benefactor', 'playing', 'mother-in-law', 'relationship', 'Charlotte', 'actual', 'owner', 'corporation', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'course', 'action', 'maybe', 'applying', 'SBA', 'loan', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'going', 'address', 'why', 'Lathan', 'character', 'who', 'clearly', 'had', 'little', 'respect', 'husband', 'supposed', 'be', 'financial', 'expert', 'would', 'choose', 'place', 'slush', 'fund', 'joint', 'account', 'are', 'bottom', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'totem', 'pole', 'mention', 'more', 'confounding', 'issues', 'would', 'probably', 'constitute', 'spoilers.In', 'end', 'typical', 'Perry', 'movie', 'work', 'entertained', 'past', ""'re"", 'looking', 'movie', 'ostensibly', 'uplifting', 'message', 'reality', 'will', 'not', 'survive', 'contemplative', 'scrutiny', ""'re"", 'right', 'place', 'So', 'five', 'star', 'rating', 'measured', 'other', 'Perry', 'films', 'not', 'wide', 'range', 'films', 'similar', 'plotlines', 'where', 'real', 'assessment', 'would', 'be', 'two', 'stars']",N/A

1041129,A169YDDDOJ6O9H,B000LW7REE,M. Wench,"[30, 33]","*Please Note: There May be Spoilers in My Review*Tyler Perry has become one of my favorite actors / directors.  He seems to, ""get"" what women feel / know and what we, as humans ahould always remember, that to treat strangers with respect as they may be angels in disguise.Charlotte ( Kathy Bates ) and Alice ( Alfre Woodard ) have been friends for over 30 years.  Charlotte is a rich woman and Alice is a middle class woman, yet their friendship has thrived for so many years.  I have to say that if Anyone is Blessed to have a friend as wonderful as Alice, God has Blessed them, cause not too many people come around like her that keep you grounded and love you no matter what.We meet Charlotte and Alice at the wedding of Alice's daughter Andrea.  Charlotte is picking up the tab for the whole wedding, as Alice is her dear friend and Charlotte's own son decided to elope, so Charlotte can't do the whole Southern grand wedding thing for him.I didn't like Andrea ( Alice's daughter ) at all when I first was introduced to her.  To me, she was a spoiled, spiteful woman who had major issues with Charlotte and why her mom was allowing Charlotte to pay for her wedding.  She was still dislikable through almost all the movie to me.Charlotte's son, William Cartwright, played by, Cole Hauser, is a major leech, judging by the way his eyes undress Andrea,  Sanaa Lathan, at her wedding.  It's implied, then shown that William and Andrea become lovers, while their kind and supportive spouses know nothing about what is going on.  Andrea's husband Chris,  Rockmond Dunbar, and his brother-in-law Ben, Tyler Perry, want to start their own construction business, and Chris approaches William regarding a construction company and William can become a share holder in the new company.  William does a usual ya-da ya-da, and a, ""I will get back to your wife to get to you"" jabber and then tells Andrea that he will fire her husband which she promptly agrees to.Meanwhile, Alice and Charlotte decide to do a spontaneous road trip west to see and do whatever they feel like seeing and doing.  You can see the special bond between the two women and the love they share, as Alice puts up with a lot of Charlotte's wild ways and spontinaity, yet manages to keep her faith and get Charlotte Baptized in the whole journey.  It is on this journey that Alice discoveres that Charlotte has early Alzheimer's and doesn't want Alice to tell anyone - especially her no good, power grubbing son.Charlotte butts heads with her son who wants to rule the company.  She knows he isn't ready to rule, so she hires Robin Givens to help run her company, much to her son's dismay and anger. William plans a secret meeting to oust his mother as head of the company, but Charlotte  intervenes, thanks to a forewarning by her not-so-favored daughter-in-law.This movie has a wonderful way of making a person thankful for those that love them, for enjoying the life one has been Blessed with, and making the most of kindness to others.  This movie made me mad at Andrea and want to slap her upside the head and tell her she isn't gonna get her, ""other man"", and to listen to her mom and sister, cause they know better.  Made me appreciate the gift of my best friend and the love of my husband and how Alice's faith in God helped her every day through all her life's trials.As with most Tyler Perry movies, I can not praise them enough for the messages and entertainment value he provides.  You'll sit and watch this to enjoy a movie, but you will also feel your heart and conscience get bigger, just like the grinch in the Dr. Suess story did.",5,Another Awesome Movie From Tyler Perry,1231977600,"01 15, 2009",2009,3608,"['*Please', 'Note', 'May', 'be', 'Spoilers', 'My', 'Review*Tyler', 'Perry', 'become', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', '/', 'directors', 'get', 'what', 'women', 'feel', '/', 'know', 'what', 'humans', 'ahould', 'always', 'remember', 'treat', 'strangers', 'respect', 'may', 'be', 'angels', 'disguise.Charlotte', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'Alice', 'Alfre', 'Woodard', 'have', 'been', 'friends', '30', 'years', 'Charlotte', 'rich', 'woman', 'Alice', 'middle', 'class', 'woman', 'friendship', 'thrived', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'have', 'say', 'Anyone', 'Blessed', 'have', 'friend', 'as', 'wonderful', 'Alice', 'God', 'Blessed', 'cause', 'not', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'come', 'keep', 'grounded', 'love', 'matter', 'what.We', 'meet', 'Charlotte', 'Alice', 'wedding', 'Alice', 'daughter', 'Andrea', 'Charlotte', 'picking', 'up', 'tab', 'whole', 'wedding', 'Alice', 'dear', 'friend', 'Charlotte', 'own', 'son', 'decided', 'elope', 'Charlotte', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'whole', 'Southern', 'grand', 'wedding', 'thing', 'him.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Andrea', 'Alice', 'daughter', 'when', 'first', 'was', 'introduced', 'was', 'spoiled', 'spiteful', 'woman', 'who', 'had', 'major', 'issues', 'Charlotte', 'why', 'mom', 'was', 'allowing', 'Charlotte', 'pay', 'wedding', 'was', 'still', 'dislikable', 'almost', 'movie', 'me.Charlotte', 'son', 'William', 'Cartwright', 'played', 'Cole', 'Hauser', 'major', 'leech', 'judging', 'way', 'eyes', 'undress', 'Andrea', 'Sanaa', 'Lathan', 'wedding', 'implied', 'then', 'shown', 'William', 'Andrea', 'become', 'lovers', 'kind', 'supportive', 'spouses', 'know', 'nothing', 'what', 'going', 'Andrea', 'husband', 'Chris', 'Rockmond', 'Dunbar', 'brother-in-law', 'Ben', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'want', 'start', 'own', 'construction', 'business', 'Chris', 'approaches', 'William', 'regarding', 'construction', 'company', 'William', 'can', 'become', 'share', 'holder', 'new', 'company', 'William', 'usual', 'ya-da', 'ya-da', 'will', 'get', 'back', 'wife', 'get', 'jabber', 'then', 'tells', 'Andrea', 'will', 'fire', 'husband', 'promptly', 'to.Meanwhile', 'Alice', 'Charlotte', 'decide', 'do', 'spontaneous', 'road', 'trip', 'west', 'see', 'do', 'feel', 'seeing', 'doing', 'can', 'see', 'special', 'bond', 'two', 'women', 'love', 'share', 'Alice', 'up', 'lot', 'Charlotte', 'wild', 'ways', 'spontinaity', 'yet', 'keep', 'faith', 'get', 'Charlotte', 'Baptized', 'whole', 'journey', 'journey', 'Alice', 'Charlotte', 'early', 'Alzheimer', ""n't"", 'want', 'Alice', 'tell', 'anyone', 'especially', 'good', 'power', 'grubbing', 'son.Charlotte', 'butts', 'heads', 'son', 'who', 'rule', 'company', ""n't"", 'ready', 'rule', 'Robin', 'Givens', 'help', 'run', 'company', 'much', 'son', 'dismay', 'anger', 'William', 'secret', 'meeting', 'oust', 'mother', 'head', 'company', 'Charlotte', 'intervenes', 'thanks', 'forewarning', 'not-so-favored', 'daughter-in-law.This', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'way', 'making', 'person', 'thankful', 'love', 'enjoying', 'life', 'one', 'been', 'Blessed', 'making', 'most', 'kindness', 'others', 'movie', 'made', 'mad', 'Andrea', 'want', 'slap', 'upside', 'head', 'tell', ""n't"", 'gon', 'get', 'other', 'man', 'listen', 'mom', 'sister', 'cause', 'know', 'better', 'Made', 'appreciate', 'gift', 'best', 'friend', 'love', 'husband', 'how', 'Alice', 'faith', 'God', 'helped', 'day', 'life', 'trials.As', 'most', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'movies', 'can', 'not', 'praise', 'enough', 'messages', 'entertainment', 'value', ""'ll"", 'sit', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'will', 'also', 'feel', 'heart', 'conscience', 'get', 'bigger', 'just', 'grinch', 'Dr.', 'Suess', 'story', 'did']",N/A

I love the acting in it, and the storyline was the best Tyler Perry I had seen so far. I like all his movies, but a few of his movies are a little too predictable for me. This one had several themes, one of which was just the unlikely friendship between women through time. The other themes about greed, jealousy and relationships was good also, but the friendship theme overrode and was the best of the whole movie. Kathy Bates and Alfre Woodard are great, and so are the rest of the actors.

How excited I became when I saw that they were working together in a film!  But alas, this is not the film that allows them to work their magic.Unfortunately, ""The Family That Preys"" has so much dumbed-down dialogue, that I felt writer/director Tyler Perry must have decided that if the country's newspapers have to be written on a sixth-grade level, then so must movies in order to gather the widest appeal.  Perry wastes a great deal of dialogue having his characters explain their relationships in no uncertain terms - a perennial sign of bad writing, churning out throw-away lines like, ""You two are sisters!""  ""You're my husband!"" - instead of writing interesting dialogue that reveals the relationship in other ways.  I found myself being embarrassed for the ultra-talented cast, seeing them all working so hard, having been given such vapid lines and cliches.And what follows IS clich&eacute; after clich&eacute;, both verbally and visually, seeming to never end.  To instill instant sentimentality and create familiarity, Perry counts on references to some of our favorite films, even recreating The Whistlestop Caf&eacute;, replete with a reference to fried green tomatoes and a visit from Ol' Smokey Lonesome.  Perry also wants us to know that Charlotte and Alice are out chasing a wild hare, crossing the country just like ""Oprah and Gayle"" or ""Thelma and Louise"" -- just in case we can't make that connection for ourselves.  At one point when a particular character slaps another and sends her reeling over the diner counter, I felt like I was watching an old Bonanza episode.  I expected a player piano to suddenly crank up and a saloon fight to ensue, and the (original) Cartwrights to walk through the door, just in time to save the day.The scenes of power play, greed, and betrayal seem like script rejects from the 80's TV show ""Dallas"" or ""Dynasty.""  And while I never watched those shows, the commercials back then were enough to make viewing these scenes feel like I had seen it all before.I've not seen any of Perry's other films.  The ""Madea"" comedies look like simple fun, and this dramatic disappointment won't keep me from checking them out for (hopefully) a good belly larf.In the meantime, I'll keep waiting for the vehicle that will allow Alfre Woodard to take home that much-deserved Oscar -- which she should have captured twice by now, in ""Passion Fish"" and ""Miss Firecracker""!

Henson does not fall far from the minstrel tree, despite its stab at the dramatic.The StoryWritten and directed by Tyler Perry (I Can Do Bad All By Myself), open on the wedding of Andrea (Sanna Lathan ~ Out of Time) and Chris (Rockmond Dunbar ~ Soul Food) being held at the home of Charlotte Cartwright (Kathy Bates ~ Titanic), a wealthy construction business owner in Atlanta.  Charlotte is holding the wedding for the couples because she is best friends with the bride's mother Alice Pratt (Alfre Woodard ~ Primal Fear).As the story(?) progresses we learn the Andrea is an insufferable ingrate and a snob who barely loves her husband--which of course begs the question: why did she marry the man?  And she is at constant odds with her sister Pamela (Taraji P. Henson ~ The Curious Case of Benjamin Button).  Andrea is also having an affair with her boss William Cartwright (Cole Hauser ~ Good Will Hunting), who is in turn married to meek Jillian Cartwright (KaDee Strickland ~ Private Practice).Meanwhile, Andrea's husband Chris desperately wants to go into business for himself and constantly ribs Ben (Tyler Perry), husband of Pamela, about the prospect.  Eventually he speaks to William about it and as a result: he and Ben get fired, and the world upends...My ThoughtsAdmittedly, if it weren't for Tyler Perry movies, we would scare see some of the most talented Black American actors working, or trying to work, in Hollywood.  Because let face it, ""main stream"" Hollywood seems to have no place for them in its decidedly lily white world, wherein only one race has the capacity to really experience life outside of a comedy film.So it is disappointing to this Black American reviewer that Perry's movies have thus far been the same nonsense that came before; movies starting overwhelming Black actors that have to act a fool in order to make box office dollars.  ""The Family That Preys,"" does break out of that mold by trying to offer up a dramatic turn, but fails miserably because, well, Tyler wrote it.  The story is implausible, the characters two dimensional and largely contrived along racial and gender stereotypes, and the dialog is hopeless inept and laughable at times.  It actually pained me--on the actor's behalf--to have to watch the movie.I would have hoped by now that Perry had established enough credibility to start turning our Black American programing with depth and purpose; stories that show Black people as three dimensional being capable of exhibiting the full range of human emotion, but The Family That Preys is not that movie!Now I love, love, love me some Sanaa  Latham, have ever since Love & Basketball, but The Family That Preys should be left off her cinematic resume!  Yes the movie is just that bad!  And as usual the antiheroes (Andrea and William) are very bad, and the good guys (Chris and Ben) are very noble and trusting (Chris)--until they--he (Chris)--gets mad and strikes his wife.The Perry formula (preachy, pandering, gospel-laden, soap with more than an ounce of ignorance thrown in for good measure), is well worn at this point and its time Perry tried something new.  But, why should he, since his dedicated core audience comes back for more time and again!The one good thing about The Family That Preys, other than just seeing Sanna, was Gladys Knight's soul-stirring rendition of the Lee Ann Womack classic I Hope You Dance in the closing credits, it was superb!",1,Another Unbelievably Unrealistic and Predictably Horrid Movie From Perry,1311465600,"07 24, 2011",2011,3966,"['Bottom-Line', 'Skip', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'big', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'fan', 'Millions', 'people', 'are', 'having', 'seen', 'handful', 'movies', 'television', 'offerings', 'can', 'not', 'life', 'understand', 'why', 'offerings', 'are', 'often', 'simple', 'affairs', 'lack', 'intellect', 'depth', 'real', 'interest', 'certain', 'demographic', 'yet', 'man', 'millions', 'dollar', 'peddling', 'what', 'amounts', 'modern', 'day', 'Step', 'Fetch', 'movies.Tyler', 'Perrys', 'Family', 'Preys', '2008', 'staring', 'Sanaa', 'Latham', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'Alfre', 'Woodard', 'Rockmond', 'Dunbar', 'Taraji', 'P.', 'Henson', 'not', 'fall', 'far', 'minstrel', 'tree', 'stab', 'dramatic.The', 'StoryWritten', 'directed', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'Can', 'Do', 'Bad', 'All', 'Myself', 'open', 'wedding', 'Andrea', 'Sanna', 'Lathan', 'Time', 'Chris', 'Rockmond', 'Dunbar', '~', 'Soul', 'Food', 'being', 'held', 'home', 'Charlotte', 'Cartwright', 'Kathy', 'Bates', '~', 'Titanic', 'wealthy', 'construction', 'business', 'owner', 'Atlanta', 'Charlotte', 'holding', 'wedding', 'couples', 'best', 'friends', 'bride', 'mother', 'Alice', 'Pratt', 'Alfre', 'Woodard', '~', 'Primal', 'Fear', '.As', 'story', 'learn', 'Andrea', 'insufferable', 'ingrate', 'snob', 'who', 'barely', 'husband', 'course', 'question', 'why', 'did', 'marry', 'man', 'constant', 'odds', 'sister', 'Pamela', 'Taraji', 'P.', 'Henson', '~', 'Curious', 'Case', 'Benjamin', 'Button', 'Andrea', 'also', 'having', 'affair', 'boss', 'William', 'Cartwright', 'Cole', 'Hauser', '~', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'who', 'turn', 'married', 'meek', 'Jillian', 'Cartwright', 'KaDee', 'Strickland', '~', 'Private', 'Practice', '.Meanwhile', 'Andrea', 'husband', 'Chris', 'desperately', 'go', 'business', 'constantly', 'ribs', 'Ben', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'husband', 'Pamela', 'prospect', 'Eventually', 'William', 'result', 'Ben', 'get', 'fired', 'world', 'ThoughtsAdmittedly', 'were', ""n't"", 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'movies', 'would', 'scare', 'see', 'most', 'talented', 'Black', 'American', 'actors', 'working', 'trying', 'work', 'Hollywood', 'let', 'face', 'main', 'stream', 'Hollywood', 'have', 'place', 'decidedly', 'lily', 'white', 'world', 'wherein', 'only', 'one', 'race', 'capacity', 'really', 'experience', 'life', 'comedy', 'film.So', 'disappointing', 'Black', 'American', 'reviewer', 'Perry', 'movies', 'have', 'thus', 'far', 'been', 'same', 'nonsense', 'came', 'movies', 'starting', 'overwhelming', 'Black', 'actors', 'have', 'act', 'fool', 'order', 'make', 'box', 'office', 'dollars', 'Family', 'That', 'Preys', 'break', 'mold', 'trying', 'offer', 'up', 'dramatic', 'turn', 'miserably', 'well', 'Tyler', 'wrote', 'story', 'implausible', 'characters', 'two', 'dimensional', 'largely', 'contrived', 'racial', 'gender', 'stereotypes', 'dialog', 'hopeless', 'inept', 'laughable', 'times', 'actually', 'pained', 'actor', 'behalf', 'have', 'watch', 'movie.I', 'would', 'have', 'hoped', 'now', 'Perry', 'had', 'established', 'enough', 'credibility', 'start', 'turning', 'Black', 'American', 'programing', 'depth', 'purpose', 'stories', 'show', 'Black', 'people', 'three', 'dimensional', 'being', 'capable', 'exhibiting', 'full', 'range', 'human', 'emotion', 'Family', 'That', 'Preys', 'not', 'movie', 'Now', 'love', 'love', 'love', 'Sanaa', 'Latham', 'have', 'ever', 'Love', 'Basketball', 'Family', 'Preys', 'should', 'be', 'left', 'off', 'cinematic', 'resume', 'Yes', 'movie', 'just', 'bad', 'usual', 'antiheroes', 'Andrea', 'William', 'are', 'very', 'bad', 'good', 'guys', 'Chris', 'Ben', 'are', 'very', 'noble', 'trusting', 'Chris', 'Chris', 'mad', 'wife.The', 'Perry', 'formula', 'preachy', 'pandering', 'gospel-laden', 'soap', 'more', 'ounce', 'ignorance', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure', 'well', 'worn', 'point', 'time', 'Perry', 'tried', 'something', 'new', 'why', 'should', 'dedicated', 'core', 'audience', 'back', 'more', 'time', 'again', 'one', 'good', 'thing', 'Family', 'That', 'Preys', 'other', 'just', 'seeing', 'Sanna', 'was', 'Gladys', 'Knight', 'soul-stirring', 'rendition', 'Lee', 'Ann', 'Womack', 'classic', 'Hope', 'Dance', 'closing', 'credits', 'was', 'superb']",N/A
1041160,A27IHUTE7Q9S7V,B000LW7REE,Vivian,"[1, 2]","This gets two stars because of its fabulous cast. Otherwise, it deserves only one.Tyler Perry wants the world to know that as long as a woman is disrespectful, it is OK to hit her. And it's her loss when the two of you divorce. Mr Perry also thinks that racial insults are fine when the recipient is a black woman who is sleeping with your husband.This movie starts well enough. I found it interesting. But, toward the end, it becomes predictable and annoying. How does a protagonist commit suicide? What's the value in that? We should have seen the two ladies enjoying their latter years instead. It would have been a much richer movie had we been shown love triumphing over Alzheimer's, IE, the women finding a creative and beautiful way to continue their friendship despite the condition.Then there's the part where a man hits his wife and gets away with it. In fact, the woman would love to get back together with him after the divorce. Oh, and the one where a woman tells her husband's mistress that he would never be seen in public with ""someone like you."" The wife stays unhappily married to her straying husband, so, again, the woman gets the short end of the stick.What does Tyler Perry have against women?The Family that Preys is as cliche laden as it is predictable. Let the two who are having an affair get together and fail to stay together. That's a much better twist than making a protagonist take her own life. Let the two who are cheated on find happiness elsewhere. Because it is not always the case that the man stays with his wife. Even if it were, that angle has been used to death.The movie did have LOL moments --- the bar scene was quite good. The cast is made up of fine actors. The script is the letdown. Why can't Tyler Perry hire amazing writers who will produce intelligent, rich work?
