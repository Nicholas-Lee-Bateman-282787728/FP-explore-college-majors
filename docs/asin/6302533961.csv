Straight Talk is a great film, one of my personal favorites, but it's definitely not a title I would see as high on the list for a Blu-Ray transfer. So initially, I was wary of getting gipped by a sub-par release. Priced at $5, however, I figured I would take a chance on it. I'm extremely glad that I did. The transfer isn't sparklingly stunning as the latest movies in theaters, but it is most definitely an upgrade on the DVD, which I've owned and watched many times. Close-up shots are especially clear, the image doesn't exhibit too much instability (most of the poor quality is limited to the opening credit sequence), and there is very little dirt or debris to be found in the image. The sound was also decent and perfectly capable for the type of movie Straight Talk is. It is limited to the front speakers, however, so don't expect to be completely submerged in sound. The soundtrack is clear, to the point, and it get's the job done. All in all, if you were ever a fan of this movie, I highly recommend the upgrade.

""Straight Talk"" in all of its Dolly-filled glory, is truly one of the most magical film journeys you're ever gonna take.Dolly Parton stars as a character who isn't down with B.S. and gives nothing but Straight Talk to anyone that will listen.  That includes Griffin Dunne and the far-underused Charles Fleischer.  Conflicts ensue and barbs begin flying as this no-nonsense gal speaks her mind in a barrage of comic premises.But then things take a dark turn.  Despair sets in when Dolly realizes that not everyone wants to hear her Straight Talk, and she begin to question her coping mechanisms, her quality of life, and the society she is fighting so hard to change.  There is a bloody battle sequence that may be too grisly for some audience members, but for me it underscored the classic Man Vs.

Once there she ""accidentally"" becomes put on as a talk radio show host as someone who gives advice to callers with problems, by a newsroom that thinks she's a doctor who was supposed to be starting that day but conveniently did not show up. So they suppose she's the doctor. Such luck for just stepping into a different room to get a cup of coffee. Oh, but the cheesy far-fetched cliches don't end there. Yup, you can guess what happens - the people love her, the radio execs recruit her.In enters James Woods (who looks and acts terribly as a news reporter who's so uncomfortably creepy to watch as a romantic ""lead"" you understand why he's never played that role since) as the 'love interest' who just happens to always be at the right place at the right time, and proceeds to court Dolly Parton, or Dr. Shellie Kenyan (can I just insert how ridiculous the name sounds please) so that he can get story to seek out the ""dirt"" on her and expose her to the world (she's not a doctor, she's not educated, etc) but then predictably falls for her, then must decide between his career and her. ....He picks her. ...don't be upset that I told you, you knew it was coming.Then enters the ex-boyfriend who just happens to come looking for her yet the script writers could not seem to come up with good enough material for him, so the ex just sort of reveals who Woods really is and is never heard from again. Hey, at least Michael Madson gets paid.*humorous smile* *sigh breath* anyway, then we get the typical scene where she gives away her real identity and past on the radio because she just can't take being dishonest anymore! She's been lying to everyone! *sarcasm* While she does say this, the film gives no reason for her to, and any typical human being would just keep going at it considering the complete lack of friction she's faced during her entire stint as a psychologist radio talk show host who isn't really a psychologist. It's ridiculous that someone giving this type of advice could even GET a real career on talk radio... but the movie does that to showcase her ""realness."" If things became any more convenient for Sherrie I think we wouldn't have a good enough movie. .... oh wait, that's right, we DON'T have a good enough movie, but we do HAVE a movie, so we might as well watch it.While Straight Talk is just filled with completely far-fetched situations that would be handled VERY differently if this were the case in 2011, this does entertain, even just barely, for its 90 minute time length. What keeps you interested? Well, it's not boring, so much as it is just plain cliche and dumb. I think the term ""blonde"" can be used here. It's like the film took every romantic comedy textbook movie cliche and compressed them all into this film, and didn't even do them WELL at that. Once again, Dolly Parton's breasts are the stars of the show, not to also mention her irritatingly ""good girl"" demeanor who surprisingly always seems to waste her time on lousy boyfriends. Well, that is until James Woods came along and very very easily sweeps her off her feet (in case you need me to tell you, their chemistry on screen is eye-rollingly vomit inducing... or shall I just be nice and say utterly and completely non-existent?)I bought this because it was at a very low bargain clearance bin price at a local retailer, otherwise I would never have even bothered. You've seen this movie a million times before, there's no need to see it again. I feel a bit bad if I'm really ragging on this, but I do it with a slight smile. Dolly is a charming and sweet lady, and considering she wrote numerous songs for this movie, it did mean a lot to her, and you can tell she really does try with her performance, so good for her. It's just too bad the material she was given is just so laughably dumb. Sorry Dolly, you're a sweetheart but I'm just being honest.P.S. To James Woods - please, PLEEEEEAASE do not ever play a romantic lead again. Your portrayal reminded me of a horny 17 year old trapped in the body of a 45 year old man.Technical aspects: The movie provides NO extras whatsoever. You get 2 modes: Play movie and scene selection. That's it. As far as the Blu-ray transfer, it doesn't look abysmal and I've seen worse, but you can still make out plenty of burn spots from the original theatrical film. Yes it's fairly clean for Blu-ray, but still terrible for what we expect in Blu-ray quality. If you need to get it, just get the DVD. I understand it is difficult to put these old movies into a high definition remastering, but it is really only worth it for movies that are, well, worth it. One example being The Neverending Story. Old movie with a very beautiful transfer.",2,"Hysterically Dumb, but Tolerable",1305158400,"05 12, 2011",2011,5036,"['low', 'brow', 'Dolly', 'Parton', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'annoyingly', 'honest',
