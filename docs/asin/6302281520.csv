And Julia Nickson-Sole is convincing as Sung.As a result of the Japanese invasion of China a wealthy family is displaced from their home and divested of their servants. The Commie replacement government was not very sympathetic toward this type of family either.Now we see what is happening in degrees as she phased out of her cushy surroundings. She actually tries to comply with the new environment and approves of it.Then the government helps her to learn about the Christianity by accusing her of going to a Christian school as a child. She tries to explain that she only went to the school and that did not make her Christian.

305473,ADES8B01WRPI3,6302281520,"Bryan E. Leed ""Jesus says, 'Go and Sin No More!""","[24, 27]","This is the true story of a ""modern"" girl in China, growing up and falling in love during the Japanese occupation of WWII, and then things get even worse when the Mao Communists take over!I first heard of this movie through Christian channels, because the film also shows how the heroine becomes a Christian, sort of ""accidentally,"" when the Communists persecute her as an adult because she is a suspected traitor to the Communist Party, simply because she once attended a Christian grade school, when she was a child--and religion is the enemy of Communism (from the point of view of Chairman Mao's Communist Party)!I didn't know what to expect from this DVD, and I was very pleasantly surprised by how powerful the film is, and how well the actors perform their roles. Some of the scenes are very gripping, tense, and even scary! It is made on location in Hong Kong and Macau, but for an English-speaking audience. All of the lead actors speak English fluently.This film could easily appeal to a large variety of viewers. Hipsters that like all things Asian will appreciate the history and culture shown. It is also a love story. Christians will find it interesting to see the persecuted church being accurately portrayed. But this film is equally all these things at the same time! It is not primarily a Christian film, or a romance film, etc. It just has all those aspects to it.Both of my own parents were of this era, growing up in Asia (in the Dutch East Indies, a.k.a. Indonesia), when WWII brought the Japanese occupiers to their homes! I am not sure if my folks would get upset by this film or not, but I know I was freaked out by some scenes, just knowing what my folks told me about what went on during WWII.I found it most interesting to see how the paranoid Communists feared Christianity, and religion, as an enemy of communism, so much so that any religious people, even if only vaguely linked to religion, were harshly persecuted, beaten, ran out of their homes, and put into forced labor camps. My maternal grandfather worked forced labor for the Japanese, building railroad tracks for years, separated from the family. This occupation and persecution still affects my family relations, especially the way my parents view life--harsh brutality hiding behind a civilized facade that could break at any moment!This film moves along at a good pace, in its 90 minutes. They cover a lot of ground, and you will be grimacing and upset at some of the scenes, though none are too graphic for children, the situations are too intense of younger kids.My biggest inspiration from watching this movie is feeling guilty about how cushy and easy my life is in the USA, while these Christian persecutions continue around the world! It makes me motivated to do more for the work of Christ!There is a 20 minute ""Making Of..."" bonus feature which is not mentioned, but is on the Special Features page. There you will see the director and actors talking about making the film, and at the movie premiere. You can even see the actual Nora Lam, the main character in real life, attending the movie premiere, but she says little or nothing. I suppose she doesn't speak english, perhaps, but she does have a Christian charity organization based around her, and they do missionary work in China.",5,"Interesting Cultural, Love Story, Drama that is also Exotic, Educational, Historical, and Inspirational!",1136246400,"01 3, 2006",2006,3288,"['true', 'story', 'modern', 'girl', 'China', 'growing', 'up', 'falling', 'love', 'Japanese', 'occupation', 'WWII', 'then', 'things', 'get', 'even', 'worse', 'when', 'Mao', 'Communists', 'take', 'first', 'heard', 'movie', 'Christian', 'channels', 'film', 'also', 'how', 'heroine', 'Christian', 'sort', 'accidentally', 'when', 'Communists', 'persecute', 'adult', 'suspected', 'traitor', 'Communist', 'Party', 'simply', 'once', 'attended', 'Christian', 'grade', 'school', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'religion', 'enemy', 'Communism', 'point', 'view', 'Chairman', 'Mao', 'Communist', 'Party', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'DVD', 'was', 'very', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'how', 'powerful', 'film', 'how', 'well', 'actors', 'perform', 'roles', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'gripping', 'tense', 'even', 'scary', 'made', 'location', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'Macau', 'English-speaking', 'audience', 'lead', 'actors', 'speak', 'English', 'fluently.This', 'film', 'could', 'easily', 'appeal', 'large', 'variety', 'viewers', 'Hipsters', 'things', 'Asian', 'will', 'appreciate', 'history', 'culture', 'shown', 'also', 'love', 'story', 'Christians', 'will', 'find', 'interesting', 'see', 'persecuted', 'church', 'being', 'accurately', 'portrayed', 'film', 'equally', 'things', 'same', 'time', 'not', 'primarily', 'Christian', 'film', 'romance', 'film', 'etc', 'just', 'aspects', 'it.Both', 'own', 'parents', 'were', 'era', 'growing', 'up', 'Asia', 'Dutch', 'East', 'Indies', 'a.k.a', 'Indonesia', 'when', 'WWII', 'brought', 'Japanese', 'occupiers', 'homes', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'folks', 'would', 'get', 'upset', 'film', 'not', 'know', 'was', 'freaked', 'out', 'scenes', 'just', 'knowing', 'what', 'folks', 'told', 'what', 'went', 'WWII.I', 'found', 'most', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'paranoid', 'Communists', 'feared', 'Christianity', 'religion', 'enemy', 'communism', 'so', 'much', 'religious', 'people', 'even', 'only', 'vaguely', 'linked', 'religion', 'were', 'harshly', 'persecuted', 'beaten', 'ran', 'homes', 'put', 'forced', 'labor', 'camps', 'maternal', 'grandfather', 'worked', 'forced', 'labor', 'Japanese', 'building', 'railroad', 'tracks', 'years', 'separated', 'family', 'occupation', 'persecution', 'still', 'family', 'relations', 'especially', 'way', 'parents', 'view', 'life', 'harsh', 'brutality', 'hiding', 'civilized', 'facade', 'could', 'break', 'moment', 'film', 'along', 'good', 'pace', '90', 'minutes', 'cover', 'lot', 'ground', 'will', 'be', 'grimacing', 'upset', 'scenes', 'none', 'are', 'too', 'graphic', 'children', 'situations', 'are', 'too', 'intense', 'younger', 'kids.My', 'biggest', 'inspiration', 'watching', 'movie', 'feeling', 'guilty', 'how', 'cushy', 'easy', 'life', 'USA', 'Christian', 'persecutions', 'continue', 'world', 'motivated', 'do', 'more', 'work', 'Christ', '20', 'minute', 'Making', 'bonus', 'feature', 'not', 'mentioned', 'Special', 'Features', 'page', 'will', 'see', 'director', 'actors', 'talking', 'making', 'film', 'movie', 'premiere', 'can', 'even', 'see', 'actual', 'Nora', 'Lam', 'main', 'character', 'real', 'life', 'attending', 'movie', 'premiere', 'little', 'nothing', 'suppose', ""n't"", 'speak', 'english', 'perhaps', 'have', 'Christian', 'charity', 'organization', 'based', 'do', 'missionary', 'work', 'China']",N/A

305477,A3MWP39R0W9TQX,6302281520,"Heather W. ""heartful_home""","[3, 3]","This story can teach us a lot about the situation in communist China. It's not against China, but against the evils of communism. In fact, she simply describes her experience and others can easily feel the evil. They didn't need to alter it to preach against it. After having read the book, which the movie follows very closely, I can say that nothing was exaggerated in the behavior of the communists toward Nora.The movie does cut off almost half of the book, so if it piqued your interest, I encourage you to find a copy of the book here at Amazon and read it. She goes on with a ministry that will just amaze you at the faith she had. It's really beautiful and inspiring to this Christian (I'm a Mormon but she is not) who wishes to serve her Lord Jesus Christ and is given her powerful example.The movie is a little clunky, but for its budget, it's very good. I watched the miracle scene twice to figure it out and still wasn't quite sure what happened. SPOILER AHEAD. I read the book and to my satisfaction, Nora found out later in life about the miracle. One of the guards from that day described his experience. He, along with the other guards, aimed to shoot her. Three times they tried. But each time, an extremely bright light would appear, heavy winds would blow and their guns would heat up making it uncomfortable and impossible to shoot at her. They shot but it went to the wall behind and elsewhere. The guard was so impressed with a God that would cause this to happen, that he immediately ran off and went to a church to talk to a Nun and was converted.To end my review, I will say that those without faith can watch the movie and the book and explain away the miracles, but those who exercise a little faith and an open heart can see clearly the miracle of her wonderful life story.",4,An important story brought to film,1208908800,"04 23, 2008",2008,1801,"['story', 'can', 'teach', 'lot', 'situation', 'communist', 'China', 'not', 'China', 'evils', 'communism', 'fact', 'simply', 'experience', 'others', 'can', 'easily', 'feel', 'evil', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'alter', 'preach', 'having', 'read', 'book', 'movie', 'very', 'closely', 'can', 'say', 'nothing', 'was', 'exaggerated', 'behavior', 'communists', 'Nora.The', 'movie', 'cut', 'off', 'almost', 'half', 'book', 'so', 'piqued', 'interest', 'encourage', 'find', 'copy', 'book', 'here', 'Amazon', 'read', 'ministry', 'will', 'just', 'amaze', 'faith', 'had', 'really', 'beautiful', 'inspiring', 'Christian', ""'m"", 'Mormon', 'not', 'who', 'serve', 'Lord', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'given', 'powerful', 'example.The', 'movie', 'little', 'clunky', 'budget', 'very', 'good', 'watched', 'miracle', 'scene', 'twice', 'figure', 'out', 'still', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'happened', 'SPOILER', 'AHEAD', 'read', 'book', 'satisfaction', 'Nora', 'found', 'out', 'later', 'life', 'miracle', 'One', 'guards', 'day', 'described', 'experience', 'other', 'guards', 'aimed', 'shoot', 'Three', 'times', 'tried', 'time', 'extremely', 'bright', 'light', 'would', 'appear', 'heavy', 'winds', 'would', 'blow', 'guns', 'would', 'heat', 'up', 'making', 'uncomfortable', 'impossible', 'shoot', 'shot', 'went', 'wall', 'elsewhere', 'guard', 'was', 'so', 'impressed', 'God', 'would', 'cause', 'happen', 'immediately', 'ran', 'off', 'went', 'church', 'talk', 'Nun', 'was', 'converted.To', 'end', 'review', 'will', 'say', 'faith', 'can', 'watch', 'movie', 'book', 'explain', 'away', 'miracles', 'who', 'exercise', 'little', 'faith', 'open', 'heart', 'can', 'see', 'clearly', 'miracle', 'wonderful', 'life', 'story']",N/A

305479,AF93CIG6EZUWU,6302281520,Jonathan Luysterborghs,"[12, 31]","Sadly; this is not a movie about Christianity in China.  It is not a movie about the persecution of Christians; nor about the growth and spread of Christianity in China.  I only watched it because I was told that the movie addressed these issues that I have a powerful connection to and experience with.  Parts of the movie may appeal to the fundamentalist fringe of American Christianity.  There are approximately three scenes in the movie where religious belief or practice is actually a theme and it is presented in a provocative, opportunistic manner to enflame viewers' religious loyalties as part of a politically manipulative ploy.Although the serious, traumatic, and unfortunate events and issues presented in this clunky and disjointed movie really did happen to China and to all of the Chinese people who were alive during those time periods, they are portrayed throughout this movie from a non-Chinese viewpoint and without sensitivity to Chinese culture.  Character development is minimal, adolescent, and the main characters are portrayed too much as ""special victims"".  Western ideas, behaviors, and attitudes are injected into scenes of Chinese family or romantic life where they still do not exist today, let alone in the mid-20th century.  It seems as though most of the actors are foreign-born (away from China) Chinese and their body language, facial expressions, culture, and style of expressing ideas through dialogue is so non-Chinese that it makes for an absolutely bizarre viewing experience.  The storyline, which with a slightly less myopic focus could have expressed the injustice and suffering experienced so universally in China during the periods depicted, might have been admirable to share; but the motive behind making the movie is so obviously questionable as to give the feel of a thinly veiled political propaganda flick.  By remembering what this movie is not it reveals what it really is.  This really just seems to be a dissident ""anti-Chinese communism"" movie.  Since it claims to represent someone's true-life story there may also have been the goal of making a large sum of money through exploiting the strong political feelings held by some Hong Kongese and Taiwanese people.  The ongoing themes are ""how can we get out of here"", ""how can this be happening to me and my family"", ""we were once wealthy and affluent; so this is worse for us"", ""how can we get away from them"", and the movie portrays complex political themes in a very black and white manner.  Maybe this movie was seen as ""a story worth a million dollars"" by someone; but I wish that I had not wasted my money and a part of my evening watching it.  What happened to the family portrayed in this movie was wrong; but so was the making of this artless production!  The movie has a story to tell; but is equally without heart, soul, or culture as the invading Japanese army portrayed in the opening scenes and the oppressive Red Guard shown in the closing scenes; just prior to the depiction of the leading lady crawling through a non-existent desert no-man's-land between China and ""freedom"" in Hong Kong.

305480,A1L43KWWR05PCS,6302281520,Lawyeraau,"[27, 32]","This is the incredible story of Nora Lam, a woman whose unwavering faith in God has seen her through more upheavals in her life than most people ever experience. This film is an adaptation of her book and is a condensation of Ms. Lam's extraordinary life. James F. Collier, who wrote the film adaptation, also directed the film.In the film, her story begins in 1941, when she was a young child named Sung Neng Yee and lived in Shanghai with her wealthy parents, Dr. and Mrs. Sung (James Shigeta and Frances Nuyen), amidst unparalleled luxury and privilege. She was a spoiled and pampered child, a veritable princess. In December of 1941, Neng Yee's life would forever change, as her family was forced to flee their home, when the Japanese invaders overran all of Shanghai. For the Sung family, a life of privilege would forever be a thing of the past.Nine years later, in 1950, Neng Yee (Julia Nickson-Soul), a beautiful young woman living in reduced circumstances with her family, was a student at Soochow University. She was living on the cusp of Chairman Mao's Cultural Revolution and was now pro-communist in her beliefs. Neng Yee studied hard at the university, and there she met and fell in love with Lam Cheng Shen (Russell Wong), a handsome young scholar with a proclivity for dressing in western clothing. Some time after graduation, Neng Yee and Cheng Shen married.Then, everyone's re-education began. Under the auspices of the Cultural Revolution, her father, a well respected medical doctor, was forced to scrub floors in the same hospital in which he had been a prominent physician. Thus, was to begin the road of disillusionment for Neng Yee. Once persecuted by the Japanese, the Sungs now found themselves to be part of the collateral damage of the Cultural Revolution.Shortly after, a pregnant Neng Yee and her husband found themselves subjected to interrogations by Communist officials, as they were deemed to be suspicious because of their family connections and because of that fact that Neng Yee had, at one time, held Christian beliefs. So, her nightmare began. Under interrogation, as part of her of her re-education, she re-counted to her interrogators her life at a Christian boarding school years ago. During the chaos of the Cultural Revolution, it was thought that confession and criticism were the first steps to social reform in China.Neng Yee acknowledged that for a time she had turned to Christianity, only to have forgotten about it by the time she was sixteen, when she, instead, had turned to Chairman Mao for guidance. As Neng Yee's independent spirit began to chafe under the repressive and oppressive party line, under interrogation, Neng Yee found God again. She eventually found herself in conflict with the state and sentenced to death. Her moment of truth arrived when the pregnant Neng Yee was brought before the firing squad. What happened next is sure to make one believe in miracles. It is at that miraculous moment that life really began for Neng Yee. God promised Neng Yee that she and her family would be free and leave China. The film ends with that promise being fulfilled.In actuality, it is not the end of her story but only the beginning. Neng Yee and her family emigrated to the United States, and Neng Yee became Nora Lam. She went on to live a life that is nearly incredible in terms of its experiential breadth. It was to be a secular life ultimately lived in the service of God in all parts of the world. It is amazing what this young woman would go on to achieve and accomplish in her life. Hers is, indeed, an inspirational story that will make one believe in a higher power, if one does not already do so. It is surely a story worth telling. Nora Lam has gone on to establish the Nora Lam Ministries, which is based in California, and she has led evangelical crusades in China and the United States. One should read the book upon which the film is based before viewing the film. As is so often the case, the book is better.The problem with the film is that it has to cram too much into too short a time period. Consequently, it leaves parts out that would make the story a little more comprehensible. Moreover, while the venerable James Shigeta and Frances Nuyen give excellent performances, as does Russell Wong, Julia Nickson-Soul, as pretty as she is, has too contemporary an edge and lacks the acting chops to be truly effective or convincing in the role. Consequently, this film pales when compared to James F. Collier's other inspirational film, ""The Hiding Place"".",3,WITH GOD AS MY WITNESS...,1128816000,"10 9, 2005",2005,4533,"['incredible', 'story', 'Nora', 'Lam', 'woman', 'unwavering', 'faith', 'God', 'seen', 'more', 'upheavals', 'life', 'most', 'people', 'ever', 'experience', 'film', 'adaptation', 'book', 'condensation', 'Ms.', 'Lam', 'extraordinary', 'life', 'James', 'F.', 'Collier', 'who', 'wrote', 'film', 'adaptation', 'also', 'directed', 'film.In', 'film', 'story', '1941', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'child', 'named', 'Sung', 'Neng', 'Yee', 'lived', 'Shanghai', 'wealthy', 'parents', 'Dr.', 'Mrs', 'Sung', 'James', 'Shigeta', 'Frances', 'Nuyen', 'amidst', 'unparalleled', 'luxury', 'privilege', 'was', 'spoiled', 'pampered', 'child', 'veritable', 'princess', 'December', '1941', 'Neng', 'Yee', 'life', 'would', 'forever', 'change', 'family', 'was', 'forced', 'flee', 'home', 'when', 'Japanese', 'invaders', 'overran', 'Shanghai', 'Sung', 'family', 'life', 'privilege', 'would', 'forever', 'be', 'thing', 'past.Nine', 'years', 'later', '1950', 'Neng', 'Yee', 'Julia', 'Nickson-Soul', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'living', 'reduced', 'circumstances', 'family', 'was', 'student', 'Soochow', 'University', 'was', 'living', 'cusp', 'Chairman', 'Mao', 'Cultural', 'Revolution', 'was', 'now', 'pro-communist', 'beliefs', 'Neng', 'Yee', 'studied', 'hard', 'university', 'there', 'met', 'fell', 'love', 'Lam', 'Cheng', 'Shen', 'Russell', 'Wong', 'handsome', 'young', 'scholar', 'proclivity', 'dressing', 'western', 'clothing', 'time', 'graduation', 'Neng', 'Yee', 'Cheng', 'Shen', 'married.Then', 'everyone', 're-education', 'began', 'auspices', 'Cultural', 'Revolution', 'father', 'well', 'respected', 'medical', 'doctor', 'was', 'forced', 'scrub', 'floors', 'same', 'hospital', 'had', 'been', 'prominent', 'physician', 'Thus', 'was', 'begin', 'road', 'disillusionment', 'Neng', 'Yee', 'Once', 'persecuted', 'Japanese', 'Sungs', 'now', 'found', 'be', 'part', 'collateral', 'damage', 'Cultural', 'Revolution.Shortly', 'pregnant', 'Neng', 'Yee', 'husband', 'found', 'subjected', 'interrogations', 'Communist', 'officials', 'were', 'deemed', 'be', 'suspicious', 'family', 'connections', 'fact', 'Neng', 'Yee', 'had', 'one', 'time', 'held', 'Christian', 'beliefs', 'So', 'nightmare', 'began', 'interrogation', 'part', 'her', 're-education', 're-counted', 'interrogators', 'life', 'Christian', 'boarding', 'school', 'years', 'ago', 'chaos', 'Cultural', 'Revolution', 'was', 'thought', 'confession', 'criticism', 'were', 'first', 'steps', 'social', 'reform', 'China.Neng', 'Yee', 'acknowledged', 'time', 'had', 'turned', 'Christianity', 'only', 'have', 'forgotten', 'time', 'was', 'sixteen', 'when', 'instead', 'had', 'turned', 'Chairman', 'Mao', 'guidance', 'Neng', 'Yee', 'independent', 'spirit', 'began', 'chafe', 'repressive', 'oppressive', 'party', 'line', 'interrogation', 'Neng', 'Yee', 'found', 'God', 'again', 'eventually', 'found', 'conflict', 'state', 'sentenced', 'death', 'moment', 'truth', 'arrived', 'when', 'pregnant', 'Neng', 'Yee', 'was', 'brought', 'firing', 'squad', 'What', 'happened', 'next', 'sure', 'make', 'one', 'believe', 'miracles', 'miraculous', 'moment', 'life', 'really', 'began', 'Neng', 'Yee', 'God', 'promised', 'Neng', 'Yee', 'family', 'would', 'be', 'free', 'leave', 'China', 'film', 'promise', 'being', 'fulfilled.In', 'actuality', 'not', 'end', 'story', 'only', 'beginning', 'Neng', 'Yee', 'family', 'emigrated', 'United', 'States', 'Neng', 'Yee', 'became', 'Nora', 'Lam', 'went', 'live', 'life', 'nearly', 'incredible', 'terms', 'experiential', 'breadth', 'was', 'be', 'secular', 'life', 'ultimately', 'lived', 'service', 'God', 'parts', 'world', 'amazing', 'what', 'young', 'woman', 'would', 'go', 'achieve', 'accomplish', 'life', 'Hers', 'indeed', 'inspirational', 'story', 'will', 'make', 'one', 'believe', 'higher', 'power', 'one', 'not', 'already', 'do', 'so', 'surely', 'story', 'worth', 'telling', 'Nora', 'Lam', 'gone', 'establish', 'Nora', 'Lam', 'Ministries', 'based', 'California', 'led', 'evangelical', 'crusades', 'China', 'United', 'States', 'One', 'should', 'read', 'book', 'film', 'based', 'viewing', 'film', 'so', 'often', 'case', 'book', 'better.The', 'problem', 'film', 'cram', 'too', 'much', 'too', 'short', 'time', 'period', 'Consequently', 'parts', 'out', 'would', 'make', 'story', 'little', 'more', 'comprehensible', 'Moreover', 'venerable', 'James', 'Shigeta', 'Frances', 'Nuyen', 'give', 'excellent', 'performances', 'Russell', 'Wong', 'Julia', 'Nickson-Soul', 'as', 'pretty', 'too', 'contemporary', 'edge', 'acting', 'chops', 'be', 'truly', 'effective', 'convincing', 'role', 'Consequently', 'film', 'when', 'compared', 'James', 'F.', 'Collier', 'other', 'inspirational', 'film', 'Hiding', 'Place']",N/A

I bought this because of these reviews and I feel like I was tricked by someone pumping up the reviews for sales.I think my title says it all.  I really would have rather described it in a more compact fashion but this is an all around bad movie.  It's the power of positive thinking meant to appeal to a Christian audience but it just reinforces the idea of cheesy Christian B-rated movies with no story line, no budget and bad acting (with the exception of Russell Wong). I bought this with an interest in those who suffer for the sake of Jesus but I'm the one who suffered watching one of the worst movies ever to make the screen.The is about Nora Lam who's story begins in China transitioning to communist China and ends with exit visa to Hong Kong and escape from China.  The premise sounded right but the execution of the story is awful.  It is choppy, unbelievable and wishy washy.  The Christian message really isn't any message at all.  Feeling bad, feeling sad, ok ... try Jesus.They do try to add the drama about her life from rags to riches.  Nora ""miraculously"" escapes the firing squad.  She is sent to a labor camp.  She gets pregnant there but ""miraculously"" gets an exit Visa from the communist government despite their suspicion of her as a spy and enemy of the state.  She takes her Visa and escapees never to return.  But it's so long, drawn out and unbelievable.What really irks me is that this is supposed to be a Christian movie so why is the typical Hollywood sex scene in it?  And why didn't any of the people who reviewed this movie mention it?  Gratuitous sex scene + Christian movie = What were they thinking?I really didn't feel like I cared about the characters in the movie.  Any good movie works hard to give you an emotional bond with the characters.  Considering the context of this movie I didn't think that would be hard.  Since it was unbelievable and the lead actress devoid of emotion it just didn't happen for me.  I suppose if the story was written better something would have been emoted but nada.I did not know Nora Lam nor am I am familiar with her ministry so pleadse understand that this is not a personal attack on her.  This is a review of a movie that in my opinion is just terrible.  The facts stated in this movie cannot be backed up make it more fiction than fact.  No one but Nora can attest that these things really happened.  Don't waste your money or time on this one.",1,How I wish I could give minus stars.  Bad movie.  Christian sexual content?
