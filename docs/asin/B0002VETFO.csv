846467,A2FPDWWVEOOVCQ,B0002VETFO,"Bobby Chavala ""Bobby""","[1, 29]","I seen all the seasons of Everybody Loves Raymond, it was an amazing show.  When I looked at Ray, he reminds me of Eugene Levy's character Jim's Dad in American Pie to his kids.  I can definitely relate to Ray Romano and Ray Barone, he lived with his parents when he was 29 and I lived with my parents when I was 24 when I was in college. When Ray started Everybody Loves Raymond, nobody believe a show can go up to nine seasons.  The ratings were so high, it would gone up to ten or eleven seasons like Frasier or Cheers.  This show is compared to the King of Queens, Ray is like Doug Heffernan and Debra is like Carrie Heffernan.  Their are few people I admired in the show was Ray and Marie.  Ray is a nice guy, he's kind of the guy girls bring home to mom.  Ray Romano is a great actor, he looks like a MTV VJ Carson Daly and Freddie Prinze Jr.  Sarah Michelle Gellar can mistake him for his husband. Ray Romano reminds me of MTV VJ Carson Daly, Freddie Prinze Jr and The King of Queens Kevin James.  Marie is like the perfect mom and grandmother, even though she meddling in their kids life, but she meddles in their life out of love and she always understanding and always cool what happened to their kids and she always make her kids feel right at home.  Doris Roberts is a perfect mom and grandmother off the set in Everybody Loves Raymond. Doris Roberts is a wonderful actress, she should of won the oscar long time ago. She reminds me of Florence Henderson in the Brady Bunch and Marion Ross from Happy Days. Patrica Heaton was an excellent actress when she plays Ray's wife, she looks like his daughter then his wife. Patricia should have been in the 50 Most Beautiful People in People weekly.  Patricia Heaton looks like she was 19 or 20.  She has greatest resemblance of Actress Jennifer Love Hewitt and The OC's Rachel Blison.  Brad Garrett when he plays Robert, his character reminds me of Bruce Willis character John McClane in Die Hard movies.  Brad Garrett ever played John McClane in Die Hard he could have done it better than ever then Bruce Willis did.  Monica Horan played Amy she is a great actress, she should have been nominated for an Emmy for the rest of the cast.  Monica Horan has the greatest resemblance of Buffy the Vampire Slayer star Sarah Michelle Gellar.  If she ever played Buffy Summers in Buffy the Vampire Slayer she would played the character better than ever Sarah Michelle Gellar would.  Anybody can mistake her for Sarah Michelle Gellar and so could Sarah's husband Freddie Prinze Jr. Monica Horan should have been in the 50 Most Beautiful People in People weekly.  The show had a great nine years, I can't believe it would have gone that far before.  The whole cast did amazing job for making the show gone longer season than any other show I saw.

846468,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B0002VETFO,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[5, 6]","First telecast in the Fall of 1996, Everybody Loves Raymond became an instant favorite among TV audiences, a love affair that would last for nine memorable seasons. Following on the heels of a series of successful sitcoms starring stand-up comics - Seinfeld, Home Improvement, The Drew Carey Show, etc., Everybody Loves Raymond drew upon the comedic talents of Ray Romano who plays the role of the title character Ray Barone...A successful Long Island-based sportswriter, Ray and his wife Debra (Patricia Heaton) enjoy a happy marriage and the company of their three children - daughter Ally (Madylin Sweeten) and twin sons Geoffrey (Sawyer Sweeten) and Michael (Sullivan Sweeten). But they also happen to live directly across the street from Ray's parents, Frank (Peter Boyle) and Marie (Doris Roberts), who take it upon themselves to enter their son and daughter-in-law's house whenever they wish (without knocking) and dispense advice and sometimes insults. Joining Frank and Marie is Ray's brother Robert (Brad Garrett), a divorced policeman, who periodically lives with Frank and Marie and is often jealous of Ray's idyllic life. Together, they create the perfect loving and dysfunctional family...The Everybody Loves Raymond (Season 2) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere in which Ray appears on a television sports talk show only to turn in a less than flattering appearance. When his family reveals the truth about his awkwardness, Ray is determined to perform better on TV, but his second stint is worse than his first... Other notable episodes from Season 2 include ""Brother"" in which Ray attempts to bond with Robert on the anniversary of his divorce, and ""The Children's Book"" in which Debra's noble attempt to write a children's book is turned into a one-on-one writing competition by Ray... Season 2 also features guest appearances by sports figures Roy Firestone, James Worthy, and Pat O'Brien...Below is a list of episodes included on the Everybody Loves Raymond (Season 2) DVD:Episode 23 (Ray's on TV)Episode 24 (Father Knows Least)Episode 25 (Brother)Episode 26 (Mozart)Episode 27 (Golf)Episode 28 (Anniversary)Episode 29 (Working Late Again)Episode 30 (The Children's Book)Episode 31 (The Gift)Episode 32 (High School)Episode 33 (The Letter)Episode 34 (All I Want for Christmas)Episode 35 (Civil War)Episode 36 (Mia Famiglia)Episode 37 (Marie's Meatballs)Episode 38 (The Checkbook)Episode 39 (The Ride-Along)Episode 40 (The Family Bed)Episode 41 (Good Girls)Episode 42 (T-Ball)Episode 43 (Traffic School)Episode 44 (Six Feet Under)Episode 45 (The Garage Sale)Episode 46 (The Wedding: Part 1)Episode 47 (The Wedding: Part 2)The DVD Report",5,One of the best shows of its time...,1113868800,"04 19, 2005",2005,2694,"['First', 'telecast', 'Fall', '1996', 'Everybody', 'Raymond', 'became', 'instant', 'favorite', 'TV', 'audiences', 'love', 'affair', 'would', 'last', 'nine', 'memorable', 'seasons', 'Following', 'heels', 'series', 'successful', 'sitcoms', 'starring', 'stand-up', 'comics', 'Seinfeld', 'Home', 'Improvement', 'Drew', 'Carey', 'Show', 'etc.', 'Everybody', 'Raymond', 'drew', 'comedic', 'talents', 'Ray', 'Romano', 'who', 'role', 'title', 'character', 'Ray', 'Barone', 'successful', 'Long', 'Island-based', 'sportswriter', 'Ray', 'wife', 'Debra', 'Patricia', 'Heaton', 'enjoy', 'happy', 'marriage', 'company', 'three', 'children', 'daughter', 'Ally', 'Madylin', 'Sweeten', 'twin', 'sons', 'Geoffrey', 'Sawyer', 'Sweeten', 'Michael', 'Sullivan', 'Sweeten', 'also', 'happen', 'live', 'directly', 'street', 'Ray', 'parents', 'Frank', 'Peter', 'Boyle', 'Marie', 'Doris', 'Roberts', 'who', 'take', 'enter', 'son', 'daughter-in-law', 'house', 'whenever', 'wish', 'knocking', 'dispense', 'advice', 'sometimes', 'insults', 'Joining', 'Frank', 'Marie', 'Ray', 'brother', 'Robert', 'Brad', 'Garrett', 'divorced', 'policeman', 'who', 'periodically', 'Frank', 'Marie', 'often', 'jealous', 'Ray', 'idyllic', 'life', 'Together', 'create', 'perfect', 'loving', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'Everybody', 'Raymond', 'Season', '2', 'DVD', 'number', 'hilarious', 'episodes', 'including', 'season', 'premiere', 'Ray', 'television', 'sports', 'talk', 'show', 'only', 'turn', 'less', 'flattering', 'appearance', 'When', 'family', 'truth', 'awkwardness', 'Ray', 'determined', 'perform', 'better', 'TV', 'second', 'stint', 'worse', 'first', 'Other', 'notable', 'episodes', 'Season', '2', 'include', 'Brother', 'Ray', 'bond', 'Robert', 'anniversary', 'divorce', 'Children', 'Book', 'Debra', 'noble', 'attempt', 'write', 'children', 'book', 'turned', 'one-on-one', 'writing', 'competition', 'Ray', 'Season', '2', 'also', 'guest', 'appearances', 'sports', 'figures', 'Roy', 'Firestone', 'James', 'Worthy', 'Pat', ""O'Brien"", 'Below', 'list', 'episodes', 'included', 'Everybody', 'Raymond', 'Season', '2', 'DVD', 'Episode', '23', 'Ray', 'TV', 'Episode', '24', 'Father', 'Knows', 'Least', 'Episode', '25', 'Brother', 'Episode', '26', 'Mozart', 'Episode', '27', 'Golf', 'Episode', '28', 'Anniversary', 'Episode', '29', 'Working', 'Late', 'Again', 'Episode', '30', 'Children', 'Book', 'Episode', '31', 'Gift', 'Episode', '32', 'High', 'School', 'Episode', '33', 'Letter', 'Episode', '34', 'Want', 'Christmas', 'Episode', '35', 'Civil', 'War', 'Episode', '36', 'Mia', 'Famiglia', 'Episode', '37', 'Marie', 'Meatballs', 'Episode', '38', 'Checkbook', 'Episode', '39', 'Ride-Along', 'Episode', '40', 'Family', 'Bed', 'Episode', '41', 'Good', 'Girls', 'Episode', '42', 'T-Ball', 'Episode', '43', 'Traffic', 'School', 'Episode', '44', 'Six', 'Feet', 'Episode', '45', 'Garage', 'Sale', 'Episode', '46', 'Wedding', 'Part', '1', 'Episode', '47', 'Wedding', 'Part', '2', 'DVD', 'Report']",Everybody Loves Raymond: Season 2

846474,A2QWXHB5IU8LCU,B0002VETFO,David W. George,"[13, 17]","I never had any interest in ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" until about two years ago, when I caught a couple of episodes in syndication. I laughed so much, I started taping old episodes and making sure to watch the new episodes on Monday nights. This is perhaps the funniest live action comedy series since the mid 80's heyday of ""Cheers"" (sorry, ""Seinfeld""), though I would still rank the glory years of ""The Simpsons"" circa 1992-97 as the greatest period of TV comedy ever.What I like about ""Raymond"" the most is the cast. I still don't know if Ray Romano is a good stand up comedian, but he is effective as Ray Barone, a sportswriter for a New York newspaper, and husband to Debra (the very cute and perky Patricia Heaton)and father to three kids. Complementing the cast are Brad Garrett as Ray's older brother Robert, and the terrific Peter Boyle and Doris Roberts as Ray's parents, Frank and Marie. Season two, like most series, is when the character development really began to take place.

846502,A2AOC1GWSMD42O,B0002VETFO,Mad Track,"[4, 7]","There seems to be a love-hate sentiment toward ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" at this website.  In response to Zeek, I think you are pathetic.  It's okay to say you hate this show and bash it, but don't give false information about the episodes.  When you falsify the synopsis of the episodes and even inserted sick references, you went too far.  Get a life buddy!Now back to the show.  It's not that bad.  It's supposed to be silly and even a bit stupid.  This is comedy, and everyone has there own preferences, some like dark comedy, while others like slap-stick kinds.  I'm going to say that ""ELR"" is more geared toward an older audience, those whose are around 25-50 years-old.  Of course that is a generalization.  But I can see how young teens aren't going to like it.  For those people, continue watching whatever you watch.Probably the only reason why anyone would want to buy the DVDs is to get the bloopers and deleted scenes!  But aside from that, I still think that the price for the whole set is a little expensive.  My favorite episodes for this season is Mozart, Good Girls, Mia Famiglia, and the Ride Along.  I think they are the most unique and funniest ones of the season.  As said in the first season, I'm very impressed with Brad Garrett's acting.  His Italian is surprisingly good in Mia Familiglia, maybe even better than Ray.  Also, I like how Ray play the piano in Mozart, it was not professional-looking, but it was very authentic and it didn't feel like acting.This show might not be appropriate for young children.  There are references to sex and some mild languages.

The characters are still not quite as heavily developed as they were around Season 3 (and it really wasn't until Season 4 until they truly took off), but it is still a nice step up from Season 1 and contains some fresh, funny episodes that all fans will love.These earliest seasons of ELR focus a lot more on Ray and Debra and their young family. The kids probably appear in this season a lot more than they do later on, and it's fun to see how Ray and Debra battled with juggling three such little kids. They were also considerably nicer to each other back in these days, and episodes like ""Marie's Meatballs"" and ""The Letter"" are hilarious because at this point, Debra still has not quite grasped how manipulative and crazy her overbearing mother-in-law can be. Believe it or not, there actually was a point in the series where Debra truly believed that the concept of a successful, mature conversation with Marie really existed! Look no further than Season 2--it is just hysterical.As much as I adore this show, I think they got slightly, slightly over the top in the last two seasons, with Debra throwing a hissy fit about absolutely everything, Marie being way over the line, etc... On the whole, they kept the series classy and fun right up to the end, but like I said it is still nice to go back to the lighter episodes that make up the first couple of seasons.",5,a fun season for fans to revisit,1144454400,"04 8, 2006",2006,1507,"['successful', 'television', 'series', 'many', 'seasons', 'Everybody', 'Raymond', 'always', 'fun', 'revisit', 'episodes', 'characters', 'are', 'still', 'not', 'quite', 'heavily', 'developed', 'were', 'Season', '3', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'Season', '4', 'truly', 'took', 'off', 'still', 'nice', 'step', 'up', 'Season', '1', 'fresh', 'funny', 'episodes', 'fans', 'will', 'love.These', 'earliest', 'seasons', 'ELR', 'focus', 'lot', 'more', 'Ray', 'Debra', 'young', 'family', 'kids', 'probably', 'appear', 'season', 'lot', 'more', 'do', 'later', 'fun', 'see', 'how', 'Ray', 'Debra', 'battled', 'juggling', 'three', 'such', 'little', 'kids', 'were', 'also', 'considerably', 'nicer', 'other', 'back', 'days', 'episodes', 'Marie', 'Meatballs', 'Letter', 'are', 'hilarious', 'point', 'Debra', 'still', 'not', 'quite', 'grasped', 'how', 'manipulative', 'crazy', 'overbearing', 'mother-in-law', 'can', 'be', 'Believe', 'not', 'actually', 'was', 'point', 'series', 'where', 'Debra', 'truly', 'believed', 'concept', 'successful', 'mature', 'conversation', 'Marie', 'really', 'existed', 'Look', 'further', 'Season', '2', 'just', 'hysterical.As', 'much', 'adore', 'show', 'think', 'got', 'slightly', 'slightly', 'top', 'last', 'two', 'seasons', 'Debra', 'throwing', 'hissy', 'fit', 'absolutely', 'everything', 'Marie', 'being', 'way', 'line', 'etc', 'whole', 'kept', 'series', 'classy', 'fun', 'right', 'up', 'end', 'said', 'still', 'nice', 'go', 'back', 'lighter', 'episodes', 'make', 'up', 'first', 'couple', 'seasons']",Everybody Loves Raymond: Season 2
846507,AD39QGHGWAOPQ,B0002VETFO,"mwreview ""mwreview""","[3, 3]","Season 2 isn't my favorite ELR season, but it is very solid and enjoyable all the way through.  It includes the two-part flashback showing Raymond and Debra's engagement and wedding and many excellent episodes, my favorites being ""Golf,"" ""Anniversary,"" ""Marie's Meatballs"" (with the infamous sabotage of the basil!), ""The Checkbook"" (with the hilarious ATM scene), ""The Ride-Along,"" ""Family Bed,"" ""Good Girls,"" and ""T-Ball.""  This season is definitely one of the best from one of the best sitcoms ever.Disc 1:""Ray's on TV""--Ray is invited on the Roy Firestone Show and his family is critical of how he pronounces words and scratches his microphone.""Father Knows Least""--Ally is being a brat so Debra and Raymond go to a parenting class where they learn about active listening skills that Ray seems to master better than Debra.""Brother""--Robert is depressed on the second anniversary of his divorce so he starts to get more attached to Raymond.  Highlight: when Ray reenacts a movie scene and says ""Hey mother...""""Mozart""--Ally doesn't want to take piano lessons from her grandma, so Raymond tries to relearn the ""Theme from Love Story"" to encourage her to pursue music.""Golf""--Raymond tricks Debra into letting him play golf and then has an anxiety attack due to the guilt.  The advice from his doctor is more golf to relieve his stress (Ray: ""Would I see a podiatrist or a proctologist to get a foot removed from my a**""). I like when Debra goes off, ""When do I get to have an episode!?""Disc 2:""Anniversary""--It's Frank and Marie's 40th anniversary and they make a startling comment about their marriage to Raymond.  I like the kid they chose to play a 10-year-old Robert in the flashback.  His mannerisms were perfect, he was even left-handed.""Working Late Again""--Thanks to Ray's mother, Debra begins to think Raymond stays at work late to avoid being at home so she gets him to work at home and soon regrets that decision.  Pat O'Brien makes a guest appearance.""The Children's Book""--Debra wants to write a children's book and Ray thinks he's helping by writing it himself.""The Gift""--It's Frank's 65th birthday and Ray didn't think they were going to buy him presents.  He then has to think of something to compete with Robert's remote boat and decides on a tropical aquarium.  An emotional episode at the end.""High School""--Raymond goes to his 20th high school reunion and Debra has a better time with his old classmates than he does.Disc 3:""The Letter""--After her Tupperware party is ruined by a certain meddling mother-in-law, Debra decides to write Marie a letter about how she makes her feel.  Raymond, of course, is against the idea.""What I  Want For Christmas""--For Christmas, Raymond wants to get Debra in the mood for what he wants all year round.""Civil War""--Ray hopes to bond with his father in a Civil War reenactment but, as a late enlistment, he's signed up with the other side.  Why Raymond getting out of a planned baby shower didn't cause a ""house divided against itself"" with Debra remains a mystery.""Mia Famiglia""--For Ally's school project, Raymond tracks down his oldest living relative who visits them from Italy and thinks he's finally found a relative to be proud of.  While she brings the family together, she may not really be family.""Marie's Meatballs""--Ray asks his mom to teach Debra how to make her meatballs and she sabotages the cooking lesson.  Debra goes off in this one, ""Who's the nutcase now!!!""Disc 4:""The Checkbook""--Debra complains about how difficult it is to do the finances and Raymond doesn't believe it so she makes him take over the bills and, whala,  their checks turn to rubber.  Unrealistic but very funny, especially the ATM scene.""Ride-Along""--Robert doesn't think his wise-cracking brother appreciates what he does for a living so he has him accompany him and his partner Judy (she's funny) on patrol.  When Raymond sees a heroic act, he writes an article about his brother but the editors make it about Raymond.""Family Bed""--Ray and Debra try to wean their daughter from having to sleep in their bed.  Of course, for Ray, this process involves his mother.""Good Girls""--The truth is out that Marie likes Amy better than Debra because she has been a ""good girl"" before marriage.  We learn something funny about Robert's birth.""T-Ball""--Deb and Ray take their kids to a T-ball game and Debra is criticized by the wimpy coach about the snacks she brought.  Not liking conflict, Ray initially does not stick up for his wife and tries to buy snacks on the sly.Disc 5:""Traffic School""--Robert's traffic school classes are dull so he introduces Traffic Cop Timmy which he uses to get out his frustrations on his family.  A little creepy.""Six Feet Under""--Raymond finds out that he's shrunk to under six feet and begins worrying about getting old and not accomplishing his goals.""The Garage Sale""--Raymond has a problem selling his kids' crib and baby clothes at a garage sale because he wants more children.""The Wedding Part 1 & 2""--The best of the end of season flashback episodes.  This two-parter goes back ten years to when Ray first gets his columnist job and proposes to Debra.  Debra is so excited about the wedding, he wonders if that is the only reason she agreed to marry him.  At the wedding, Ray's behavior makes Debra wonder if he's ""freaking out"" or is drunk.  I like how there are no clich&eacute;s in the wedding scene like the best man losing the rings or the organ playing the wedding march too long.  Ray's vows: ""I'm sorry I've been such a jerk.  I promise not to be one anymore, if you'll help me.""",5,"""I remember that look.  That used to be me.

""PILUM THROWER!""","[1, 3]","The episodes most worth mentioning are 2-Father Knows Least, 4-Mozart, 6-Anniversary, 9-The Gift, 11-The Letter, and 18-The Family Bed. The early seasons focus more on Ray, Debra, and their kids. For me Ray's parents and his brother Robert have 75% of the laughs. So, the first seasons were not as funny.In ep-2, Ray tries mightily to use some iffy tactics on his parents that he learned in a parenting class. The results are what we could have guessed. Debra gets jealous at Ray's temorary success, and than it rebounds on Ray. Frank and Marie were slowly taking center stage at this point. It was clear from this episode that they would be the growing focal point. Ep-4, Ray wants his daughter to stick with the Piano lessens his mother is giving her. He goes back to his mom for renewed lessons. Hilarity comes as he has to relive his childhood again. Ep-6, Ray finds out that his parents were once seperated at the moment they are about to enter their 40th anniversary surprise party. One exchange conveys the relationship between Marie and Frank. ""I saw other wives being picked up at the door, I wish I could pick up another wife at the door."" The going back in time sequence made for the best episode of their Sophmore season.Ep-9, Ray gave his father an aquarium for his 65th birthday. Sibling rivalry, and an envious father are at the center of this ""male triangle."" Ep-11, Debra takes the spotlight as she writes her intrefering mother-in-law-Marie a letter expressing years of her DISCONTENT. The verbal dueling in the elder Barone's kitchen are classic. The women make an armistice and the men are bewildered. Ep-18, Ally refuses to sleep in her own bed driving her parents crazy. In typical momma's boy fashion Ray gets his mother to stay the night to keep Ally out of their bed. Marie scares the child with a mud pack facial mask, and Frank looks for the great wall of Marie.

Thank God for re-runs and DVD sets that are now allowing me to catch up on everything I missed.  Oddly enough, I decided to start with season Two as the first I purchased on DVD.  The reason being that the first seasons of most sitcoms are usually so very rough and the show and cast usually aren't quite developed yet.  I wanted to watch the show when the characters were going to be more like what I know from coming in late to the game.I was not disapointed and I am sure I will pick up season one afterall.  Season two really had all of the elements that I love show much about the show and the characters just look a little younger.  And of course there is frequent appearances by Kevin James before he would get his own sitcom, ""The King of Queens"".I really enjoyed the set from the get-go...25 glorious episodes in all. I won't summarize all 25, but here are a few of my favorites from season two:""Anniversary"" - At a big surprise party for Frank and Marie's 40th wedding anniversary, Raymond is shocked to learn that his parents were once separated for a year and might have gotten divorced if Frank hadn't returned home to help with Ray's broken arm. After the initial shock wears off, Ray starts to wonder if it's his fault that his parents are together and miserable.""The Letter"" - When Marie  ruins her Tupperware party, Debra decides that she's had just about enough of her mother-in-law's constant interference. She  writes a letter to her Marie, telling her to stop intruding into her life. Horrified by the problems that this letter might trigger, Ray does everything in his power to intercept the offending document.""All I Want for Christmas"" - All Ray wants for Christmas is a little loving from his wife and he's willing to try anything and everything to have his holiday wish come true. When Ray finally has seduced Debra, his entire family is working their way into the house for Eggs Florentine and exchanging gifts.""The Checkbook"" - When Raymond takes over the family checkbook to prove to Debra how ""easy it can be"" to balance it, he discovers he is no accountant. After he quickly runs out of money and starts bouncing checks, he tries to hide the truth from Debra and winds up entangled in a mess of lies, two fake checkbooks and a large loan from his brother.""Traffic School"" - Robert proves to be a crashing bore when it comes to teaching traffic school, so he decides to practice his presentation on the family-which drives them crazy. In an attempt to lighten things up, he puts in an assist-officer call to ""Traffic Cop Timmy,"" a puppet dressed as a policeman.""The Wedding Parts 1 & 2"" - These two episodes show how Ray proposed to Debra and their eventual wedding.As far as extras, they could be better.  There's only commentary on a couple of episodes to go along with some bloopers and deleted scenes.  Nothing to write home about and hopefully future seasons will be better equipped.This is just plain funny.  Intelligent without being snobbish like Frasier and wacky without being too low brow.  These are characters that probably most of us know in our own lives.

I'd like to know what Zeek would do differently. The show's success comes from what's really an honest portrayal of a lot more families than some of us would like to admit. Much like Bill Cosby's humor, the Barone family's situations are more just plain reality in so many families than anything else, and therein lies the true humor of this show. Doris Roberts has got to be one of the greatest cast members of this or any ensemble cast...anyone who doesn't see that is just not paying attention here. I didn't start watching the series until it went into daily syndication...then I couldn't get enough of it...it's the perfect successor to Seunfeld and I'm glad these shows are making their way to DVD, like Seinfeld.
