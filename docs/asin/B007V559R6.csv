It's positively zealous in its attempt to be fun and playful, loaded with plenty of laughs and a lot of antics that anyone would enjoy watching.  Initially, it was shown as a two part episode on TV.  You can see exactly where they cut for commercials, no one bothered to smooth out the abrupt edits.  The film transfer is middling at best.  It doesn't feel like they were trying to preserve anything precious, which is a shame, because this is a good movie.",5,"""Sea lions have to stay wet ya dope!""",1395187200,"03 19, 2014",2014,520,"['determinately', 'cute', 'movie', 'two', 'boys', 'pet', 'seal', 'positively', 'zealous', 'attempt', 'be', 'fun', 'playful', 'loaded', 'plenty', 'laughs', 'lot', 'antics', 'anyone', 'would', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'Initially', 'was', 'shown', 'two', 'part', 'episode', 'TV', 'can', 'see', 'exactly', 'where', 'cut', 'commercials', 'one', 'bothered', 'smooth', 'out', 'abrupt', 'edits', 'film', 'transfer', 'middling', 'best', ""n't"", 'feel', 'were', 'trying', 'preserve', 'anything', 'precious', 'shame', 'good', 'movie']",N/A

The seal definitely steals the show and you'll find yourself laughing out loud many times with his antics.  Well played by the actors as well and you'll recognize many of them.  I highly recommend this movie which is fun for young and old alike.  They don't make movies like this any more.,5,Awesome,1381104000,"10 7, 2013",2013,400,"['are', 'Disney', 'fan', 'doubt', 'have', 'seen', 'wonderful', 'story', 'Easily', 'one', 'older', 'Disney', 'classics', 'seal', 'definitely', 'show', ""'ll"", 'find', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'many', 'times', 'antics', 'Well', 'played', 'actors', 'well', ""'ll"", 'recognize', 'many', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'fun', 'young', 'old', 'alike', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'movies', 'more']",N/A
