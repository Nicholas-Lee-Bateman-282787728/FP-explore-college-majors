It is awful that the disks are all stacked on top of each other instead of in cases. I really like this show but I don't know if I'm going to buy it if this is what it's going to look like.Besides it is now on Nick at Nite so I can watch it anytime. I already own season 1 and will get season 2 but I will have to think about getting or not.I would have given this a lower score but I love the show too much to do so. I doubt they will fix the packaging so I guess I will have to buy it this way because I love this show so much.,4,I love the Nanny But Oh My God!!!!!,1242864000,"05 21, 2009",2009,587,"['can', 'not', 'believe', 'what', 'have', 'done', 'packaging', 'awful', 'disks', 'are', 'stacked', 'top', 'other', 'instead', 'cases', 'really', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'m"", 'going', 'buy', 'what', 'going', 'look', 'like.Besides', 'now', 'Nick', 'Nite', 'can', 'watch', 'anytime', 'already', 'own', 'season', '1', 'will', 'get', 'season', '2', 'will', 'have', 'think', 'getting', 'not.I', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'lower', 'score', 'love', 'show', 'too', 'much', 'do', 'so', 'doubt', 'will', 'fix', 'packaging', 'so', 'guess', 'will', 'have', 'buy', 'way', 'love', 'show', 'so', 'much']",THE NANNY - COMPLETE SEASON 3

The second season was released way back in 2006. So it's been nearly three years now since a season of this wonderful show has been released. I hope the studios continue with releasing the series by releasing season four sometime in the near future. I know I'd buy them all instantly as they come out. The 27 episodes contained in this set are as follows:Disc One:The Pen PalFranny and the ProfessorThe Dope DiamondA Fine Family FeudVal's ApartmentShopaholicOy Vey, You're GayThe Party's OverThe Two Mrs. SheffieldsDisc TwoHaving His BabyThe Unkindest CutThe KibbutzAn Offer She Can't RefuseOy To The World - Special animated Christmas episodeFashion ShowWhere's FranThe GrandmasVal's BoyfriendDisc ThreeLove is a Many Blundered ThingYour Feets Too BigWhere's the Pearls?The Hockey ShowThat's Mid-LifeThe Cantor ShowGreen CardShip of Fran'sA Pup In ParisThe Only thing I don't like about this set is the way the discs themselves are contained.

The set comes with three discs, but each are stacked on top of one another.  To me this was a cheap way to package delicate items.  Possibly these discs could become damaged this way. All of my multi-packs have never looked this way.  Saving money is fine, but do it in a more common sense factor.  Customer satisfaction is highly important, and I don't feel that skimping on quality packaging to protect the goods is a good idea.

The Nanny is probably my favorite out of all of them mainly because I've watched it the most. I love the series' plot lines and characters. My favorite seasons would have to be seasons 2, 3, 4, and 5 because they have the best plot lines and the episodes are nothing but non-stop hilarity. Fran Fine is the nasal tone, street smart nanny who looks after Broadway producer Maxwell Sheffield's kids and teaches them everything she knows about being street smart in New York all the while getting involved in crazy schemes and trying to get the kids' father to fall in love with her (which he does and they marry in season 5). To help her out, Fran has Niles the Butler and nothing is going to stand in her way, not even Mr. Sheffield's business partner, C.C. Babcock, who has had a thing for Mr. Sheffield for quite some time. I started watching this when I was 12-years-old and I still watch it today. I've watched all six seasons on TV (thanks to Nick at Nite) and I own seasons 1, 2 and 3 on DVD. Too bad they haven't released seasons 4, 5 and 6 yet. Oh well.

Ruether,"[1, 1]","It's been a while since the first two seasons of THE NANNY were issued on DVD, so it's nice to see them get the ball rolling again with Season 3.  Lots of fun episodes here; my favorites being ""PEN PALS"" (how can you not love Niles having CC ""cluck like a chicken""???), ""A FINE FAMILY FEUD"" (with Maggie's ""sweet sixteen party""), ""SHOPAHOLIC"", and ""THE UNKINDEST CUT"" (Brighton passes out while videotaping a bris for one of Fran's relatives).  It's also nice to have the rarely-seen animated holiday episode ""OY TO THE WORLD"" included with this set.  One word of caution that hasn't been mentioned yet... I had to dock this one star due to some obvious music substitutions.  Three that I can think of at the top of my head include a generic instrumental replacing the 2001 theme music that originally appeared in Fran's fantasy as an astronaut (from ""PEN PALS""), ""Shop Around"" being replaced during ""SHOPAHOLIC"",  and the most glaring example being generic disco music replacing ""Clang Clang Clang went the trolley..."" from ""VAL'S APARTMENT"" (totally watering down the joke when they open the door thinking ""maybe there are some straight men here after all!"").

1044211,A22PMIUQWH2YPA,B000M93DBW,Southpaw,"[0, 0]","I grew up watching reruns of the Nanny in the late 90s. The Nanny brought laughter into my life, during a time when my life was bleak as I was battling depression. It's a fantastic show and I've watched the episodes multiple times! I used to tape them on my VCR so I could re-watch them whenever I wanted to. Even though now I own seasons 1-3 on DVD, I still can't discard my VHS tapes. I keep having this scenario that if my DVDs get stolen or Sony stops the distribution of the DVDS, then I'd still have them on VHS! I know it sounds irrational, but that's how much I love this show! Fran Drescher is outrageous as Fran Fine. The characters are a colorful bunch and the actors have done a remarkable job. I absolutely love the banter and zingers between C.C and Niles. It was only a few years ago when I discovered that Daniel Davis (the actor playing Niles the Butler) wasn't British! In my opinion, his British accent is more pronounced than Charles (Mr. Sheffield). Daniel's comedic timing is impeccable! I think he's the true star of the show. I love the dynamics between Sylvia and Fran( I can't picture anyone but Renee Taylor playing the role of Sylvia. She'd outdone herself) and Sylvia's obsession with Fran getting married. I guess every woman can relate to that! Lol.While I like shows like the Big Bang Theory, they don't get me to howl with laughter like The Nanny. A few days ago, I was watching on my laptop the episode of when Niles catches Fran in the tub with Mr. Sheffield, and I made the mistake of drinking water during that scene. My monitor as well as my keyboard were covered in water. Luckily, my laptop is still working. So when you watch this and plan to have food/beverages, please keep electronic devices and gadgets far away.Like Just Shoot Me and The Practice, The release of The Nanny is also a no show. My patience is wearing thin.VERY THIN. I'm normally not a collector of DVDs, but when it comes to my favorite shows, I want them on my shelf. I don't understand why Sony isn't releasing The Nanny seasons 4,5,6. It incenses me to know that crummy shows that haven't even garnered a wide audience or have been cancelled have been released, whereas the aforementioned shows are being awfully delayed. I'm starting to sound like a broken record, because that's exactly what I said in my review of Just Shoot Me. What gives?? I am flat-out irritated. Sony, please release the remaining seasons! It's 2013! Please don't make us wait ten years for season 4 and another ten years for season 5! It's been looooong overdue!",5,Sony!
