543156,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00003CY5R,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[5, 8]","The Affair of the Necklace is a surprising film for one that falls within the dreaded period piece genre.  Whenever I watch films of this nature I typically feel like I have seen the story time and time again.  A mismatched couple finds love together, only to have some tragedy befall them by the end of the film.  It is the classic ""Pride & Prejudice"" scenario mixed with a blend of ""Wuthering Heights"".  It is sad because for a very long time Hollywood couldn't release a period piece film that redefined the genre.  Most viewers avoided these types of films because of the clich&eacute; nature coupled with the dull, monotonous acting that could only be accomplished by a short-list of actors.  To me the genre is painful, but The Affair of the Necklace doesn't seem to fit within that age-old mold.  What makes this film stand out from the rest within the genre is the fact that screenwriter John Sweet gives us deception and intrigue with our characters, coupled with a story that you would see in typical mainstream cinema.  While it may be based on a true event, Sweet's story, coupled with the decent eye of director Charles Shyer (of Baby Boom fame) gives us a modern twist instead of the stale comradery that this genre is commonly used to.  The Affair of the Necklace stands proudly on its own.What makes this film stand out is that Shyer doesn't hide anything from us.  This can be both a positive and a negative because it doesn't keep you guessing until the end.  You know what is going to happen, it isn't sympathetic in nature, but instead demonstrates the power of the human desire and the corruption of the human ""need"".  What I found interesting about this film is the contrast between the class that Swank tries to fit within and that of the upper class citizens of Versailles.  All that she wants is to be a part of her family's history, which is that of wealthy and social standing, while it is that upper class that ultimately destroys the reputation of France.  Swank's character Jeanne is shown to become a symbol of the common class, but in reality she is just trying to reach up into a wide open sky.  The struggle then becomes rather confusing as Shyer wants us to feel sympathy for the obvious villain (Pryce) or are we to feel sympathy for the central character, Swank, which commits evil deeds for her own self righteousness.  While some will argue that this is a downfall to the film, I kind of enjoyed it.  I liked seeing my mind flutter between the two, knowing that one seems evil and the other is evil.  It was creative for this period piece to see the story unfold from the eyes of the thief instead of the savior.  This worked until the end, when Shyer demanded sympathy from us and, in my case, found none.  By the end, I could not care what happened to Swank because she had it coming to her all along, from the beginning we see her mind reacting to situations, and this one happened to put her in the hypothetical ""hot seat"".  It was this internal struggle with this film that really made Shyer's outing stand apart from the rest in the genre.While I liked Shyer's film, it was his choice of actors that I need to fault as why it isn't a perfect film.  While I would agree with most film critics that Swank is an actress that is not afraid of sinking her teeth into a role, I did feel that this singular role was not made for her shoes.  Swank seems ""silly"" as Jeanne, attempting to bring a level of emotion to a character that felt more snobbish and jealous than honest.  Her smile, her actions, her sex-appeal just wasn't prevalent in this film, nor did it work.  This was her first feature role after Boys Don't Cry, and I think that Shyer really just wanted to ride the Oscar bandwagon, without thinking further within his character.  Pryce is ... well ... Pryce.  If you have seen one of his period piece films, then you have seen him in this one.  I think directors know he looks like someone from that period, so he is instantly cast.  Simon Baker is a decent choice to play the gigolo; he seems to have the smile that could melt women.  Adrien Brody seemed to come out from left field for this film.  He is a great actor, but he was used as a classic ""reveal"" in this film.  A surprise known actors comes in during the center of the film to bring viewers out of the possible sleep they could be facing.  Christopher Walken, a actor that I believe rules this generation of cinema, was odd in this film.  I kept waiting for him to yell, ""COWBELL, this film needs more COWBELL"".  He wore a strange mustache and odd hair, but was fun none the less.  Alas, Antoinette herself could have been better played than through the eyes of Joely Richardson.  While she may be a decent actress, this was just too goofy for her.  We needed a stronger female actress in this role.  While I loved Sweet's story, it was Shyer's choice of casting that really hurt the overall sensation of this film.Overall, I could suggest this film to friends and family.  I don't think I could watch it again, but it was definitely worth the two hours spent in front of the television.  I thought, outside of the performances, that the cinematography was beautiful, the change of direction from your normal period piece drama was a breath of fresh air, and that Shyer did a decent job of placing a new spin on a tired genre.  There are some major sparks to this film, but it just didn't light a full fire in my eyes.  I loved the opening music as well.  The addition of Alanis Morissette's hypnotic voice to the opening and closing to this film added a strong undertone that set the pace for the rest of the film.  It was a strong film for Shyer; I am not here to disown it in any way.  I want others to see this film, but I don't think I could watch it again.  Redefining a genre is smart, but Shyer could have strengthened his directing arm a bit more by adding crucial actors to better roles and a stronger empathy towards one true character instead of a big switch midway through the film.  Again, I liked it, but didn't love it.Grade: *** out of *****",3,"The story of a necklace, and it's power to bring down all of France...",1162684800,"11 5, 2006",2006,6071,"['Affair', 'Necklace',

543157,A9DEBL9JBKQBF,B00003CY5R,Book Maven,"[5, 7]","As a lover of costume dramas, I was disapointed that such an amazing cast could produce such a spirtless film. Hillary Swank, though a great actress, does little to breathe life into the her character, Jeanne Valois. Though she is supposed to evoke sympathy, besides a few flashbacks we see little that makes her life seem unbearable enough to fabricate the plot to steal the necklace. Most of the characters don't do enough to express their desires and passions, and the plan to steal the necklace seems quite muddled and doomed to fail. One exception is Johnathan Bryce's Cardinal Rohan, the only character I felt was truly three dimentional. In addition to faulty performances, the script tries too hard to wrap up and affair that seems too complicated to neatly summarize in blurbs at the end of the film. All of a sudden, we see Marie Antoinette being executed, with a narrative voice that says something to the effect of ""And that was the end of Marie Antoinette."" Duh. She's in a guillotine. We miss all the steps of her getting there, however. This film seems to loosly tackles an inticate subject, and proves a thoroghly mediocre affair.

543158,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B00003CY5R,C. B Collins Jr.,"[1, 1]","This historic drama has an excellent cast with superb sets and costumes. The fundamental weakness of the film is that the heroine, Jeanne Valois-St. Remy was a criminal and the film tries to make her into a heroine fighting injustice. It just doesn't hold together when this young woman, supposedly wronged by the French royal family, seeks revenge because she was ignored. Her revenge is too self-serving to be credible, thus there remains a structural weakness in the plot and screenplay that just does not work with most viewers. The unfortunate aspect of the film is that it would have been a stronger film if it had been more historically accurate and shown Jeanne as a calculating criminal engaged in a scam. There has been much criticism of Hilary Swank's portrayal of Jeanne but I found that she does a credible job of acting with a script that lacked internal consistency.The character of Marie-Antoinette was well played by Joely Richardson. Marie-Antoinette was the innocent victim of the entire scam since the public believed she secretly tried to purchase the necklace through Cardinal de Rohan because the country was in debt and such a purchase for the queen would have run against public opinion.The character of Cardinal de Rohan was played well by Jonathan Pryce. The cardinal was a low-life of high birth. As a young bishop, he alienated Queen Maria-Theresa of Austria on a state visit to Vienna by trying to undermine the marriage arrangements between Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette and he also made a spectacle of himself in Vienna by his lavish womanizing. Years later he wishes to rise in the political structure but is stopped by the Queen. He is vulnerable to the complex scam created to deprive him of considerable funds to purchase the necklace, thinking it is for the queen. Pryce plays this gullible evil man very well.Simon Baker does a great job playing the gigolo Retaux de Vilette and Adrian Brody is also good playing the husband of Jeanne, Count Nicholas De La Motte. Christopher Walker plays the shady magician and shaman Count Cagliostro. Brian Cox is excellent as the austere Minister Breteuil, the character that tries to figure out the scam and protect the royal family. Paul Brooke plays jeweler Brehmer. Brooke is an excellent character actor who has appeared in countless films. The entire cast was excellent.The costumes were perfect and must have cost a fortune. The film supposedly cost 20 million dollars and the cast, costumes, and settings were all exceptional. It is a shame that the screenplay was distorted with some misplaced desire to make Jeanne into a heroine when the facts would have made more sense and given a better final product. In the end, the screenwriter, and thus the director, did not trust the intelligence of the viewer. They assumed they needed to make Jeanne into a sympathetic heroine rather than a complex conniving criminal. This was an error that undermined the entire project.",3,Historical accuracy would have made a better film,1357257600,"01 4, 2013",2013,2953,"['historic', 'drama', 'excellent', 'cast', 'superb', 'sets', 'costumes', 'fundamental', 'weakness', 'film', 'heroine', 'Jeanne', 'Valois-St.', 'Remy', 'was', 'criminal', 'film', 'make', 'heroine', 'fighting', 'injustice', 'just', ""n't"", 'hold', 'together', 'when', 'young', 'woman', 'supposedly', 'wronged', 'French', 'royal', 'family', 'revenge', 'was', 'ignored', 'revenge', 'too', 'self-serving', 'be', 'credible', 'thus', 'structural', 'weakness', 'plot', 'screenplay', 'just', 'not', 'work', 'most', 'viewers', 'unfortunate', 'aspect', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'stronger', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'historically', 'accurate', 'shown', 'Jeanne', 'calculating', 'criminal', 'engaged', 'scam', 'been', 'much', 'criticism', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'portrayal', 'Jeanne', 'found', 'credible', 'job', 'acting', 'script', 'lacked', 'internal', 'consistency.The', 'character', 'Marie-Antoinette', 'was', 'well', 'played', 'Joely', 'Richardson', 'Marie-Antoinette', 'was', 'innocent', 'victim', 'entire', 'scam', 'public', 'believed', 'secretly', 'tried', 'purchase', 'necklace', 'Cardinal', 'de', 'Rohan', 'country', 'was', 'debt', 'purchase', 'queen', 'would', 'have', 'run', 'public', 'opinion.The', 'character', 'Cardinal', 'de', 'Rohan', 'was', 'played', 'well', 'Jonathan', 'Pryce', 'cardinal', 'was', 'low-life', 'high', 'birth', 'young', 'bishop', 'alienated', 'Queen', 'Maria-Theresa', 'Austria', 'state', 'visit', 'Vienna', 'trying', 'undermine', 'marriage', 'arrangements', 'Louis', 'XVI', 'Marie-Antoinette', 'also', 'made', 'spectacle', 'Vienna', 'lavish', 'womanizing', 'Years', 'later', 'rise', 'political', 'structure', 'stopped', 'Queen', 'vulnerable', 'complex', 'scam', 'created', 'deprive', 'considerable', 'funds', 'purchase', 'necklace', 'thinking', 'queen', 'Pryce', 'gullible', 'evil', 'man', 'very', 'well.Simon', 'Baker', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'gigolo', 'Retaux', 'Vilette', 'Adrian', 'Brody', 'also', 'good', 'playing', 'husband', 'Jeanne', 'Count', 'Nicholas', 'De', 'La', 'Motte', 'Christopher', 'Walker', 'shady', 'magician', 'shaman', 'Count', 'Cagliostro', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'excellent', 'austere', 'Minister', 'Breteuil', 'character', 'figure', 'out', 'scam', 'protect', 'royal', 'family', 'Paul', 'Brooke', 'jeweler', 'Brehmer', 'Brooke', 'excellent', 'character', 'actor', 'who', 'appeared', 'countless', 'films', 'entire', 'cast', 'was', 'excellent.The', 'costumes', 'were', 'perfect', 'must', 'have', 'cost', 'fortune', 'film', 'supposedly', 'cost', '20', 'million', 'dollars', 'cast', 'costumes', 'settings', 'were', 'exceptional', 'shame', 'screenplay', 'was', 'distorted', 'misplaced', 'desire', 'make', 'Jeanne', 'heroine', 'when', 'facts', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'sense', 'given', 'better', 'final', 'product', 'end', 'screenwriter', 'thus', 'director', 'did', 'not', 'trust', 'intelligence', 'viewer', 'assumed', 'needed', 'make', 'Jeanne', 'sympathetic', 'heroine', 'rather', 'complex', 'conniving', 'criminal', 'was', 'error', 'undermined', 'entire', 'project']",N/A

543162,A1G56KHOUOFWDW,B00003CY5R,"Dianne Foster ""Di""","[9, 11]","On page 203 of CITIZENS: THE CHRONICLE OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION by Simon Schama, begins Chapter Six 'Body Politics' which gives an account of the tale upon which this film is based. The film is very close to this account. Schama himself would suggest that the retelling of an historical event is biased and depends on who is doing the telling.  Several of the principle players left diaries or journals that provided their version of events.  The trial of Cardinal de Rohan, Jeanne de La Motte, Nicole Le Guay and others concerning 'The Diamond Necklace Affair' was also recorded in court records and the newspapers of the day. Each of their lawyers presented a story that best represented their clients point of view.The sad truth is that the incident was only one of many that led to the demise of the monarchy, not ""the cause"" as the film suggests.  What really happened?  The French populace believed the worst of Antoinette and the whole incident proved to be another nail in her coffin.  According to Schama, it was ""her reputation for unaffected girlish sentimentality that made Louis, the Cardinal de Rohan, believe that he could restore his position at court through her favors...""This film is well enough acted the lead fellow (Simon.....) was a murder victim in L.A.CONFIDENTIAL, Brody is the Count de la Motte, and of course Swank who plays the 'Baronne de La Motte de Valois (as she called herself),is well known.

The movie is not concerned to make a detailed account of the political forces involved inside the process of the Revolution and at this angle could be a disapointment to those who appreciate a real accurate historic movie. In fact, &quot;The Affair of the Necklace' is a flavoured and interesting story of love, revenge and redemption, almost like some great classic soup operas of the same style (as, for instance, Angelique or The Count Of Monte Cristo). Not a great movie but certainly a movie that has it's moments, highlighted by good performances by Miss Swank and Jonathan Pryce.

Dumas relates the identical story of Joseph Balsamo (aka Count Cagliostro), Jeanne de la Motte Valois, the lecherous but charming Cardinal de Rohan and the great diamond scam, although the movie makers give Dumas no credit whatsoever (I note that the book is available on Amazon.com, and I highly recommend it!).The costume designer, Malena Canonero, deserves plaudits for the swathes of silks, satins, and lace jabots that recreate the opulence of the 18th-century court of Louis XVI magnificently. The settings are also splendid. I found much of the music jarring, however, in that the composer insisted on giving it a modern beat at times, and also used a mish-mash of Mozart's ""Requiem,"" among other things. I find such cuts and rearrangement of a bar here; a bar there, to be both lazy and a bit of a cheat. In the featurette, the director explained that he wanted to make the period ""accessible"" to modern audiences. Such ""accessibility"" not only insults the intelligence of the modern audience but also weakens the movie.Because the story is so strong, I nevertheless enjoyed the film. I was particularly impressed with the performances of Jonathan Pryce as the suave Cardinal, Adrien Brody as Jeanne's feckless husband, and Simon Baker, who is especially engaging as her love interest. All of them are believable and move well in their silks. Although Hilary Swank is an excellent actress, I thought she was miscast in this role.

(The story is ostensibly based on a actual historical event. But when Hollywood acts as the filter, one is perhaps justified in lifting a skeptical eyebrow.)Hilary Swank plays Comtesse Jeanne de la Motte-Valois, the direct descendent of a previous French monarch, whose family, the Valois, was stripped of its lands and title by the current King Louis XVI in a spasm of royal vengeance. Now, wanting the family estate back, our heroine haunts Versailles seeking an audience for her petition. But the King carries a grudge, so no lackey of his with any power is prepared to listen. Then Jeanne meets Retaux de Vilette (Simon Baker), a young and handsome court insider who advises her to learn what the movers and shakers want. With that knowledge, she can leverage what she wants.Well, as it so happens, there's this ab fab diamond necklace that a couple of fawning jewelers wish to sell to Queen Marie Antoinette (Joely Richardson), otherwise they're out the considerable costs associated with the stones' acquisition. But Marie, knowing it was originally crafted for another Babe, scorns the offer. She only wants the Paris Mob, which desires her head on a platter (so to speak), off her back. Then there's Cardinal Louis de Rohan (Jonathan Pryce), who otherwise spends his time giving willing young mademoiselles, um, energetic one-on-one religious instruction. The good Cardinal wants to be made Prime Minister, an office apparently within the gift of the Queen, but she's hated his guts for years. Finally, there's Count Cagliostro (Christopher Walken), a friend of de Rohan's and reputedly a powerful seer of future events, who's willing to spin a good vision if the price is right. Now sufficiently educated, the Comtesse hatches a scam with de Vilette and her own philandering and usually absent husband (Adrien Brody) to get her birthright back.As I've said, one will perhaps appreciate THE AFFAIR OF THE NECKLACE only after accepting the dubious premise of profound gullibility on the part of France's #1 Catholic primate, and Jeanne's incredible naivet&eacute; in believing her house of cards won't collapse in the first breeze of scrutiny. Swank's de la Motte is pretty and vulnerable, but perhaps too innocent as the injured and righteous party to be real.  Pryce has the most interesting role as the randy, ambitious and impressively liveried prelate. Indeed, the film's costuming is first rate.

While Queen Marie Antoinette of France still held on to her head, she became embroiled in a scandal over a necklace. The scandal, in fact, contributed to the rise of the French Revolution and the demise of the monarchy in France.The leading jewelers of the day, Charles Boehmer and Paul Bassenge, had wanted Marie Antoinette to buy an elaborate and very expensive, multi-looped diamond necklace, weighing approximately 2800 carats. This necklace, which had six hundred and forty seven diamonds, had purportedly been designed for Madame Du Barry, the mistress of Marie Antoinette's father-in-law, the late King Louis XV, and a woman she despised. Marie Antoinette was not at all interested in this necklace and made herself quite clear to the somewhat desperate jewelers, who had invested much of their capital in this necklace.In the film, a young woman, Jeanne St. Remy de Valois (Hilary Swank), who called herself a Countess by virtue of her marriage of convenience to a certain rake, Nicolas de La Motte (Adrien Brody), wanted to get back her father's estates, which had been taken by the crown after he had been, she believed, wrongfully executed for his perceived political beliefs. She was obsessed with righting this wrong and regaining her family's lost honor.When she was unable to secure that which she so desired, she took up with a court gigolo, Retaux de Vilette (Simon Baker). With his assistance, she concocted an elaborate scheme, rife with political intrigues, and secured possession of the notorious diamond necklace under the ostensible color of Queen Marie Antoinette's authority. This theft ultimately came to light, and she and her cohorts were  arrested in this matter, although the necklace was never recovered. This would lead to a sensational trial, because her accused accomplice in the matter was none other than Cardinal Louis Constantin de Rohan (Jonathan Pryce), a prince of France.The film, woodenly directed by Charles Shyer, centers around the character, Jeanne. Unfortunately, Hilary Swank is unable to carry the day. Her portrayal of Jeanne is one dimensional. She also seques back and forth between her obvious American accent and a pseudo-British one. To sum up her performance in a nutshell, it is sub-par. An otherwise excellent actress, she is simply out her element in this period film, because she is unable to overcome her contemporary veneer.Of course, as she is the centerpiece of the film and fails, so does the film, no matter how well meaning the endeavor.  Of course, she had help, as the script has its problems. There is very little tension for a film that is about one of the greatest thefts ever conceived. Not even the delicious performance of Jonathan Pryce, as the dissolute Cardinal de Rohan, can overcome some of the fundamental flaws in this film. Still, there are some intriguing moments in the film, and those who enjoy period pieces and historical dramas may get a modicum of enjoyment viewing it.",3,TAKE  HILARY TO THE  PILLORY...,1032048000,"09 15, 2002",2002,3006,"['film', 'loosely', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Queen', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'France', 'still', 'held', 'head', 'became', 'embroiled', 'scandal', 'necklace', 'scandal', 'fact', 'contributed', 'rise', 'French', 'Revolution', 'demise', 'monarchy', 'France.The', 'leading', 'jewelers', 'day', 'Charles', 'Boehmer', 'Paul', 'Bassenge', 'had', 'wanted', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'buy', 'elaborate', 'very', 'expensive', 'multi-looped', 'diamond', 'necklace', 'weighing', 'approximately', '2800', 'carats', 'necklace', 'had', 'six', 'hundred', 'forty', 'seven', 'diamonds', 'had', 'purportedly', 'been', 'designed', 'Madame', 'Du', 'Barry', 'mistress', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'father-in-law', 'late', 'King', 'Louis', 'XV', 'woman', 'despised', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'was', 'not', 'interested', 'necklace', 'made', 'quite', 'clear', 'somewhat', 'desperate', 'jewelers', 'who', 'had', 'invested', 'much', 'capital', 'film', 'young', 'woman', 'Jeanne', 'St.', 'Remy', 'de', 'Valois', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'who', 'called', 'Countess', 'virtue', 'marriage', 'convenience', 'certain', 'rake', 'Nicolas', 'de', 'La', 'Motte', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'wanted', 'get', 'back', 'father', 'estates', 'had', 'been', 'taken', 'crown', 'had', 'been', 'believed', 'wrongfully', 'executed', 'perceived', 'political', 'beliefs', 'was', 'obsessed', 'righting', 'wrong', 'regaining', 'family', 'lost', 'honor.When', 'was', 'unable', 'secure', 'so', 'desired', 'took', 'up', 'court', 'gigolo', 'Retaux', 'de', 'Vilette', 'Simon', 'Baker', 'assistance', 'concocted', 'elaborate', 'scheme', 'rife', 'political', 'intrigues', 'secured', 'possession', 'notorious', 'diamond', 'necklace', 'ostensible', 'color', 'Queen', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'authority', 'theft', 'ultimately', 'came', 'light', 'cohorts', 'were', 'arrested', 'matter', 'necklace', 'was', 'never', 'recovered', 'would', 'lead', 'sensational', 'trial', 'accused', 'accomplice', 'matter', 'was', 'none', 'other', 'Cardinal', 'Louis', 'Constantin', 'Rohan', 'Jonathan', 'Pryce', 'prince', 'France.The', 'film', 'woodenly', 'directed', 'Charles', 'Shyer', 'centers', 'character', 'Jeanne', 'Unfortunately', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'unable', 'carry', 'day', 'portrayal', 'Jeanne', 'one', 'dimensional', 'also', 'back', 'forth', 'obvious', 'American', 'accent', 'pseudo-British', 'one', 'sum', 'up', 'performance', 'nutshell', 'sub-par', 'otherwise', 'excellent', 'actress', 'simply', 'out', 'element', 'period', 'film', 'unable', 'overcome', 'contemporary', 'veneer.Of', 'course', 'centerpiece', 'film', 'fails', 'so', 'film', 'matter', 'how', 'well', 'meaning', 'endeavor', 'course', 'had', 'help', 'script', 'problems', 'very', 'little', 'tension', 'film', 'one', 'greatest', 'thefts', 'ever', 'conceived', 'Not', 'even', 'delicious', 'performance', 'Jonathan', 'Pryce', 'dissolute', 'Cardinal', 'de', 'Rohan', 'can', 'overcome', 'fundamental', 'flaws', 'film', 'Still', 'are', 'intriguing', 'moments', 'film', 'who', 'enjoy', 'period', 'pieces', 'historical', 'dramas', 'may', 'get', 'modicum', 'enjoyment', 'viewing']",N/A

For she was surrounded by some true talent.  The actor who plays Cardinal de Rohan is fantastic.  In fact, all of the secondary actors and actresses do a decent job.There's also the matter of the wildly inaccurate retelling of history.

They perverted history in the telling of the story, casting Jeanne in the role of the poor, innocent, misused and discarded aristocrat who is justified in her actions.

He's since made a career with comedies such as ""The Parent Trap"" & ""Father of the Bride, I & II.""  He continued to branch out with the Jude Law/Susan Sarandon remake of ""Alfie,"" which I liked.  This film was his first ""serious"" drama, although for much of the film I thought it was going to be a comedy crime caper set in historical France.  The major problem with the film is that the disparate elements work against each other.Hilary Swank is one of those rare actresses who gained prominence on TV's ""90210"" for a year and has then garnered two Best Actress Oscars in two nominations, ""Boys Don't Cry"" (1999) & ""Million Dollar Baby"" (2004).  Whether it squares with history or not, Jeanne de la Motte Valois is played as a heroic scoundrel, using intrigue and deception to right a wrong.  Maybe we could see her as a female Zorro, a vigilante hero.  However, the trial at the end tries to crescendo with great sympathy for this character, but the film simply didn't build to that.  I expected her to pull another fast one to escape.Simon Baker who has been on CBS' new ""Smith"" series and had a Golden Globe nomination in 2001 for his role on TV's ""The Guardian"" does a good job as the tongue-in-cheek gigolo who's willing to take risks for romance.  His light touch makes us root for him to get the girl.  While his other film projects like ""Something New,"" ""The Devil Wears Prada"" & ""Ring 2"" have shown both comic and dramatic skills, the prison beating and his final scene being dragged out of the courtroom don't seem to match with the narration that he never saw Jeanne again.  We wanted them to get together.Adrien Brody whose Best Actor Oscar is for ""The Pianist"" does a credible job as the rascal husband.  The script gives us teasers about the attraction between the two, but doesn't let Swank & Brody really burn the bridges or explore all the levels.Christopher Walken does a good job as the hocus pocus Count.  With his Best Supporting Actor Oscar in 1978 for ""The Deer Hunter,"" Shyer certainly had an award-winning cast with which to work!Joely Richardson who reflects some of her mother Vanessa Redgrave's features does an excellent job as Marie Antoinette.  I've enjoyed her so much on the ""Nip & Tuck"" TV show as Julia that when I heard her voice, I immediately identified her as the same actress.  She does a nice job of being superficial, plotting, determined and then defeated as she loses her head.Jonathan Pryce, who I will always probably think of in James Bond, does a good job being the sleazy Cardinal Louis de Rohan.  Milena Canonero has the film's sole Oscar nomination for Best Costume Design.  As a whole, this is an entertaining film.  If you allow yourself to rise above the flaws, it is a worthwhile evening of entertainment.

The deviousness is not seen in a negative light but as a strong desire to create right in a world that has taken all that was good and meaningful. This might be and this might not be. Since I do not know much on Jeanne, I just enjoyed the lush sweep and flow of this dramatic period piece. I thought Swank did a good job of acting. She had a slow, creative sway to her movement and her speaking patterns. I also liked the sparkle of the supporting cast. I thought this movie was going to be poor, based on some reviews I had read, but I was quite pleased that I rented this movie. It is filmed with rich colors, pleasing intrique and sparkling wit. The history may differ or it may not, but I liked the art style of this filmLisa Nary",4,A Lush Feel,1049760000,"04 8, 2003",2003,1392,"['movie', 'based', 'real-life', 'story', 'Jeanne', 'de', 'la', 'Motte-Valois', 'woman', 'who', 'driven', 'claim', 'family', 'heritage', 'bring', 'back', 'honor', 'name', 'legacy', 'Ms.', 'Swanks', 'portrayl', 'done', 'tone', 'sadness', 'seen', 'abandoned', 'child', 'who', 'terribly', 'father', 'father', 'according', 'history', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'man', 'wanted', 'fairness', 'given', 'people', 'was', 'opposition', 'ruling', 'royalaty', 'outspokeness', 'rebellion', 'brought', 'death', 'parents', 'Jeanne', 'happiness', 'was', 'roughly', 'snatched', 'away', 'deviousness', 'need', 'gain', 'back', 'been', 'taken', 'deviousness', 'not', 'seen', 'negative', 'light', 'strong', 'desire', 'create', 'right', 'world', 'taken', 'was', 'good', 'meaningful', 'might', 'be', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'much', 'Jeanne', 'just', 'enjoyed', 'lush', 'sweep', 'flow', 'dramatic', 'period', 'piece', 'thought', 'Swank', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'acting', 'had', 'slow', 'creative', 'sway', 'movement', 'speaking', 'patterns', 'also', 'liked', 'sparkle', 'supporting', 'cast', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'poor', 'based', 'reviews', 'had', 'read', 'was', 'quite', 'pleased', 'rented', 'movie', 'filmed', 'rich', 'colors', 'pleasing', 'intrique', 'sparkling', 'wit', 'history', 'may', 'differ', 'may', 'not', 'liked', 'art', 'style', 'filmLisa', 'Nary']",N/A

Schweitzer ""zohoe""","[10, 10]","The Affair of the Necklace is an entertaining and lavish retelling of the infamous scandal, in the years just prior to the outbreak of the French Revolution, that invloved a disgraced countess, a lecherous cardinal, the Queen of France, and a fabulous diamond necklace.Hillary Swank plays the Comtesse de la Motte Valois, the daughter of a disgraced and murdered nobleman who is obsessed with reclaiming her title and her lands.  Though married to a rakish philanderer, she falls in with a handsome though disreputable courtier named Rateux de Villet and the two hatch a ploy to use the rich and influential cardinal Rohan to buy the necklace, supposedly for Marie Antoinette, but in reality so that the Comtesse can use the diamonds to buy back her estate and reinstate her family's reputation.  Once the cardinal realizes he has been duped he sets out to bring down the conspirators, but before he can, he himself is accused of complicity in the affair, along with his shady and mysterious &quot;mystic&quot; advisor Count Cagliostro, played by an outrageously wonderful Christopher Walken.  The ensuing scandal enflames the country as the public, already resentful of the extravagance and indifference of the aristocracy, blame the ostentaciously elegant Antoinette as the true architect of the affair.  The resulting backlash over the scandal helps to ingnite the Revolution and sends Antoinette and Louis XVI to the guillotine.The Affair of the Necklace has its faults, but overall it is engaging and beautifully filmed, with sumptuous  costumes and lavish sets.  Swank is a little out of her element as the noble Comtesse, but even her American accent and sometimes cheesy dialogue can be overlooked.  Walken is over-the-top but enjoyable as the charlatan seer Cagliostro, Jonathan Pryce is excellent as the sleazy cardinal Rohan, and Joley Richardson gives a good performance in her role as Marie Antoinette.

It reeks, and no matter how it's dressed up, the director, actors, costumers, etc. could not turn this pile of bull's droppings into gold (literally, the film cost 20 million to make and grossed 400K). The failure begins with the writer's half-baked idea of taking a fascinating true story and perverting it, transforming the assorted cast of villians (who were motivated purely by greed) into some kind pop-culture heroes. Hence the confusing plot that never ads up to anything believable. Hence Swank's dismal attempt at turning a thief into a saint. Hence the cartoonish dialogue and ham-fisted acting all-around.

I must admit that I found it an excellent and fascinating entertainment, a stimulus to look into the historical sources as there are obviously inaccuracies.I liked Swank's interpretation of the character.  She has a mission - perhaps even lying to herself, it is unclear - and needs a mentor to learn the ropes of the Court intrigues.  She finds one in a gigolo, for whom she also apparently grows to have genuine affection.  They form a team with her husband, to steal a necklace as a way to gain political clout.  Along the way, they expertly con a corrupt Cardinal,  whom they play for a fool via his outsized ambitions and appetites, enlist a sleazily funny magician/seer to help, and create a scandal of historic proportions.  Once caught, everyone falls, including the monarchy.What is so fun is the portrayal this offers of the way that government worked at the time, from aristocratic privilege to reward and punishment. in social and historical context.  I found it fascinating, though would have wanted much more detail, which I can only get from books.  The scandal was a catalyst that ended a monarchy that was rotten already.Regarding the characters, the film adds much detail that can never be known.  Thus, it is historical fiction.  La Motte-Valois is ambitious and uses the levers available - sex, lies, and fraud.  We do not know what she personally thought, etc. I found the acting uniformly excellent and subtle, with many layers that can be peeled away at later viewings.  Perhaps she was a whore and simple con artist, perhaps her motives were noble to her.  I liked the mix of motivations and characters.  Her libertine husband is hilarious, her lover-mentor kind of sad in his love.  The house minister is convincingly shrewd.Recommended warmly for lovers of history and political intrigue.",4,Very fun intro to the intricacies of the pre-Revolutionary Court of Louis XVI,1243555200,"05 29, 2009",2009,1860,"['reviewers', 'were', 'awfully', 'hard', 'one', 'must', 'admit', 'found', 'excellent', 'fascinating', 'entertainment', 'stimulus', 'look', 'historical', 'sources', 'are', 'obviously', 'inaccuracies.I', 'liked', 'Swank', 'interpretation', 'character', 'mission', 'perhaps', 'even', 'lying', 'unclear', 'mentor', 'learn', 'ropes', 'Court', 'intrigues', 'one', 'gigolo', 'whom', 'also', 'apparently', 'have', 'genuine', 'affection', 'form', 'team', 'husband', 'steal', 'necklace', 'way', 'gain', 'political', 'clout', 'way', 'expertly', 'con', 'corrupt', 'Cardinal', 'whom', 'play', 'fool', 'outsized', 'ambitions', 'appetites', 'enlist', 'sleazily', 'funny', 'magician/seer', 'help', 'create', 'scandal', 'historic', 'proportions', 'Once', 'caught', 'everyone', 'falls', 'including', 'monarchy.What', 'so', 'fun', 'portrayal', 'way', 'government', 'worked', 'time', 'aristocratic', 'privilege', 'reward', 'punishment', 'social', 'historical', 'context', 'found', 'fascinating', 'though', 'would', 'have', 'wanted', 'much', 'more', 'detail', 'can', 'only', 'get', 'books', 'scandal', 'was', 'catalyst', 'ended', 'monarchy', 'was', 'rotten', 'already.Regarding', 'characters', 'film', 'much', 'detail', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'known', 'Thus', 'historical', 'fiction', 'La', 'Motte-Valois', 'ambitious', 'levers', 'available', 'sex', 'fraud', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'personally', 'thought', 'etc', 'found', 'acting', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'subtle', 'many', 'layers', 'can', 'be', 'peeled', 'away', 'later', 'viewings', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'whore', 'simple', 'con', 'artist', 'perhaps', 'motives', 'were', 'noble', 'liked', 'mix', 'motivations', 'characters', 'libertine', 'husband', 'hilarious', 'lover-mentor', 'kind', 'sad', 'love', 'house', 'minister', 'convincingly', 'shrewd.Recommended', 'warmly', 'lovers', 'history', 'political', 'intrigue']",N/A
543190,A14HHOT9999Z22,B00003CY5R,"Stephen M. Moser ""The Austin Chronicle""","[15, 16]","This historical drama is very nearly fabulous - but just misses it. It is a famous tale of intrigue and scandal, one that lent fiery fuel to Marie Antoinette's bad reputation, which in turn led to her beheading. It is the story of Countess Jeanne St. Remy Valois, played by Hilary Swank in her first role after winning an Oscar for *Boys Don't Cry*. Perhaps the point was to see how Miss Swank could act while wearing a dress, but the results are mixed, to say the least. Made out to be completely sympathetic, the Countess sees her father murdered and their property taken from them, and she wishes to avenge the wrong done to them. Begging for an audience with the Queen (Joely Richardson *is* fabulous as Marie Antoinette), the Countess is rebuffed. Meanwhile, in an unrelated episode, the Queen's jewelers have designed a magnificent diamond necklace, but the Queen, though she allegedly covets the necklace, does not purchase it, leaving the jewelers in a tight spot. The Countess falls in with an attractive courtier and also forms an alliance with Cardinal de Rohan (played magnificently by Jonathon Pryce), who is out of favor with the Queen, and convinces him to buy the necklace to smooth things over between them. Of course, the Countess is planning on stealing the necklace so that she may live happily ever after. Through machinations such a stolen letterhead, mistaken identities and other deceptions, the story comes to a boil when the details of the scandal begin to see the light of day, and unravels the careers of everyone concerned (especially Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette). It is a gripping story in the right hands. Clearly director Charles Shyer's oeuvre is comedy, and he's written, directed or produced many fine ones, such as *Private Benjamin*, *Irreconcilable Differences*, *Father of the Bride* and *The Parent Trap*. But historical drama is not his long suit. The supporting cast, cinematography, costumes and art direction are superb and engaging, but Swank is the weak link in the equation. She is simply not skilled enough to handle the role - she is passionless and wooden, but fortunately there are many scenes without her that sizzle with drama. All in all, there is a great deal of entertainment here, and if you though Hilary Swank was good in *Beverly Hills 90210*, then you'll love her in this.",3,Should Have Been Better,1106438400,"01 23, 2005",2005,2336,"['historical', 'drama', 'very', 'nearly', 'fabulous', 'just', 'famous', 'tale', 'intrigue', 'scandal', 'one', 'lent', 'fiery', 'fuel', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'bad', 'reputation', 'turn', 'led', 'beheading', 'story', 'Countess', 'Jeanne', 'St.', 'Remy', 'Valois', 'played', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'first', 'role', 'winning', 'Oscar', '*Boys', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry*', 'Perhaps', 'point', 'was', 'see', 'how', 'Miss', 'Swank', 'could', 'act', 'wearing', 'dress', 'results', 'are', 'mixed', 'say', 'least', 'Made', 'out', 'be', 'completely', 'sympathetic', 'Countess', 'father', 'murdered', 'property', 'taken', 'avenge', 'wrong', 'done', 'Begging', 'audience', 'Queen', 'Joely', 'Richardson', '*is*', 'fabulous', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'Countess', 'rebuffed', 'Meanwhile', 'unrelated', 'episode', 'Queen', 'jewelers', 'have', 'designed', 'magnificent', 'diamond', 'necklace', 'Queen', 'allegedly', 'covets', 'necklace', 'not', 'purchase', 'leaving', 'jewelers', 'tight', 'spot', 'Countess', 'attractive', 'courtier', 'also', 'alliance', 'Cardinal', 'de', 'Rohan', 'played', 'magnificently', 'Jonathon', 'Pryce', 'who', 'favor', 'Queen', 'buy', 'necklace', 'smooth', 'things', 'course', 'Countess', 'planning', 'stealing', 'necklace', 'may', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'machinations', 'such', 'stolen', 'letterhead', 'mistaken', 'identities', 'other', 'deceptions', 'story', 'boil', 'when', 'details', 'scandal', 'begin', 'see', 'light', 'day', 'careers', 'everyone', 'concerned', 'especially', 'Louis', 'XVI', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'gripping', 'story', 'right', 'hands', 'Clearly', 'director', 'Charles', 'Shyer', 'oeuvre', 'comedy', 'written', 'directed', 'produced', 'many', 'fine', 'ones', 'such', '*Private', 'Benjamin*', '*Irreconcilable', 'Differences*', '*Father', 'Bride*', '*The', 'Parent', 'Trap*', 'historical', 'drama', 'not', 'long', 'suit', 'supporting', 'cast', 'cinematography', 'costumes', 'art', 'direction', 'are', 'superb', 'engaging', 'Swank', 'weak', 'link', 'equation', 'simply', 'not', 'skilled', 'enough', 'handle', 'role', 'passionless', 'wooden', 'fortunately', 'are', 'many', 'scenes', 'sizzle', 'drama', 'great', 'deal', 'entertainment', 'here', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'was', 'good', '*Beverly', 'Hills', '90210*', 'then', ""'ll"", 'love']",N/A
