315886,A1345VRK5MYG7,6302491886,James L.,"[8, 10]","Anthony Franciosa stars as a young actor who goes to New York with big dreams and, of course, finds that it's a lot harder to make it on the stage than he realized.  Dean Martin co-stars as his director/buddy, Shirley MacLaine is the alcoholic daughter of a famed Broadway producer with whom both men get involved, and Carolyn Jones is a former actress turned successful agent.  There's nothing in this material that is original or especially fresh, since it follows a basic plotline we've seen before.  Franciosa comes on strong (and sometimes too strong) as the idealistic actor who must decide how much idealism he can afford.  Martin is solid and understated, while MacLaine chews the scenery when allowed.  Jones creates the most memorable character, mixing in pathos, humour, and a world-weary experience.  It's not a bad film, but there's nothing here you haven't already seen.  It can be a hard trip on your way to the top. It depends on how bad you want it.",3,Was It Worth The Struggle?,994896000,"07 12, 2001",2001,966,"['Anthony', 'Franciosa', 'young', 'actor', 'who', 'New', 'York', 'big', 'dreams', 'course', 'lot', 'harder', 'make', 'stage', 'realized', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'co-stars', 'director/buddy', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'alcoholic', 'daughter', 'famed', 'Broadway', 'producer', 'whom', 'men', 'get', 'involved', 'Carolyn', 'Jones', 'former', 'actress', 'turned', 'successful', 'agent', 'nothing', 'material', 'original', 'especially', 'fresh', 'basic', 'plotline', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Franciosa', 'strong', 'sometimes', 'too', 'strong', 'idealistic', 'actor', 'who', 'must', 'decide', 'how', 'much', 'idealism', 'can', 'afford', 'Martin', 'solid', 'understated', 'MacLaine', 'scenery', 'when', 'allowed', 'Jones', 'most', 'memorable', 'character', 'mixing', 'pathos', 'humour', 'world-weary', 'experience', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'nothing', 'here', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'seen', 'can', 'be', 'hard', 'trip', 'way', 'top', 'how', 'bad', 'want']",Career VHS

315890,A18F8WL8CASPVN,6302491886,"Ron4Sure ""Ron M.""","[0, 0]","Anthony Franciosa plays Sam Lawson, an aspiring New York theater actor desperate for a break.  Dean Martin is his director-friend.  They are running some Off Off theater in the Village called Actors' Rostrum.  Just can't seem to catch a break.  Franciosa is pitched from pillar to post in this overly melodramatic potboiler, with any number of implausible plot manipulations. The movie is very thin on characterizations and motivation. Franciosa's wife begs him to get a job; she miscarries his baby, then retreats home to Michigan.  Dean Martin, who has been dating a wildly alcoholic and flighty Shirley MacClaine, who also happens to be the daughter of a Broadway producer that Franciosa and Martin had been cultivating, somehow lands a job in Hollywood.  Meantime, we are asked to believe that Franciosa turns complete cynic and marries three-time loser MacClaine on the rebound, and then drives a hard bargain when asked by MacClaine and Dean Martin for a divorce.  MacClaine is pregnant carrying Martin's child.  None of these characters ever seem to truly connect with each other, although Carolyn Jones as Franciosa's spinsterish, devoted, long-suffering agent, comes closest.  And so, off the marriage debacle, Franciosa returns to New York and just as it seems he has a foothold in radio and television, along comes the blacklist -- apparently Dean Martin was fingered as a Commie, and by association Franciosa can't get legit work.  Not to worry, a draft notice from the Reserves miraculously arrives in his mailbox and he is shipped off to Korea to fight a war.  There isn't any real sense of struggle here -- mostly a much-too-well-dressed Franciosa whining and tugging at his hair, although he never truly seems hungry for a meal.  Little if any attention is paid to his actual auditions and failures.  He is finally humbled into waiting tables in a theater district restaurant, only to rise from the ashes as the Actors' Rostrum is reborn, thanks to a down at the heels Dean Martin, who appears in an alley with his tail between his legs -- his fortunes have apparently come full circle.  None of this is fully explained or for that matter believable, given the fact that the Shirley MacClaine character is supposed to be financially fixed.  Despite all of the comings and goings, the story arc is flat, and we never get a sense of Franciosa's character in any depth.",3,Overheated soap opera with Franciosa scrambling for success,1376784000,"08 18, 2013",2013,2382,"['Anthony', 'Franciosa', 'Sam', 'Lawson', 'aspiring', 'New', 'York', 'theater', 'actor', 'desperate', 'break', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'director-friend', 'are', 'running', 'Off', 'Off', 'theater', 'Village', 'called', 'Actors', 'Rostrum', 'Just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'catch', 'break', 'Franciosa', 'pitched', 'pillar', 'post', 'overly', 'melodramatic', 'potboiler', 'number', 'implausible', 'plot', 'manipulations', 'movie', 'very', 'thin', 'characterizations', 'motivation', 'Franciosa', 'wife', 'begs', 'get', 'job', 'baby', 'then', 'home', 'Michigan', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'who', 'been', 'dating', 'wildly', 'alcoholic', 'flighty', 'Shirley', 'MacClaine', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'daughter', 'Broadway', 'producer', 'Franciosa', 'Martin', 'had', 'been', 'cultivating', 'somehow', 'job', 'Hollywood', 'Meantime', 'are', 'asked', 'believe', 'Franciosa', 'complete', 'cynic', 'marries', 'three-time', 'loser', 'MacClaine', 'rebound', 'then', 'hard', 'bargain', 'when', 'asked', 'MacClaine', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'divorce', 'MacClaine', 'pregnant', 'carrying', 'Martin', 'child', 'None', 'characters', 'ever', 'seem', 'truly', 'connect', 'other', 'Carolyn', 'Jones', 'Franciosa', 'spinsterish', 'devoted', 'long-suffering', 'agent', 'closest', 'so', 'marriage', 'debacle', 'Franciosa', 'New', 'York', 'just', 'foothold', 'radio', 'television', 'blacklist', 'apparently', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'was', 'fingered', 'Commie', 'association', 'Franciosa', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'legit', 'work', 'Not', 'worry', 'draft', 'notice', 'Reserves', 'miraculously', 'mailbox', 'shipped', 'Korea', 'fight', 'war', ""n't"", 'real', 'sense', 'struggle', 'here', 'mostly', 'much-too-well-dressed', 'Franciosa', 'whining', 'tugging', 'hair', 'never', 'truly', 'hungry', 'meal', 'Little', 'attention', 'paid', 'actual', 'auditions', 'failures', 'finally', 'humbled', 'waiting', 'tables', 'theater', 'district', 'restaurant', 'only', 'rise', 'ashes', 'Actors', 'Rostrum', 'reborn', 'thanks', 'down', 'heels', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'who', 'alley', 'tail', 'legs', 'fortunes', 'have', 'apparently', 'come', 'full', 'circle', 'None', 'fully', 'explained', 'matter', 'believable', 'given', 'fact', 'Shirley', 'MacClaine', 'character', 'supposed', 'be', 'financially', 'fixed', 'comings', 'goings', 'story', 'arc', 'flat', 'never', 'get', 'sense', 'Franciosa', 'character', 'depth']",Career VHS
