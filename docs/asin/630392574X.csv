389462,AUDIJM3VUULS7,630392574X,Charles Tatum,"[5, 7]","After his sister Charlotte is kidnapped by Indians, Sam decides to try to find her himself. With promises of gold, he lures Russian (Richard Boone) along on the trip, and they head into the Utah desert, encountering hostile Apaches, and discovering what seems to be a lost tribe who enjoy their human sacrifices. Sam and Russian are captured, and Sam must pass an impossible endurance test to save his sister's life.The main problem with this film is its general air of hokeyness. Boone tries to make his character so ""colorful,"" that he overacts more than a room full of Gabby Hayes clones. His character is given a rather unglorious sendoff in the surprise finale, and he misses the big climax of the film. The rest of the cast tries, but the direction is very amateurish and the script is weak. Many scenes drag on forever, with characters repeating plot points again and again. The kidnapping tribe's origin and identity is never explained, and the one Native American who can speak English comes off like a robot version of Sacheen Littlefeather. The film also runs into the age old problem many action films run into. The journey to find Charlotte is so perilous, but the glossed-over return trip home seems to have gone without a hitch.Watch for the very unconvincing day for night scenes and grainy stock footage scattered throughout. I cannot recommend ""Against a Crooked Sky,"" although its heart seems to be in the right place.This is rated (PG) and contains physical violence, some gun violence, mild profanity, and very brief female nudity.",2,Earl Bellamy's Against a Crooked Sky,1022112000,"05 23, 2002",2002,1552,"['sister', 'Charlotte', 'kidnapped', 'Indians', 'Sam', 'try', 'find', 'promises', 'gold', 'Russian', 'Richard', 'Boone', 'trip', 'head', 'Utah', 'desert', 'encountering', 'hostile', 'Apaches', 'discovering', 'what', 'be', 'lost', 'tribe', 'who', 'enjoy', 'human', 'sacrifices', 'Sam', 'Russian', 'are', 'captured', 'Sam', 'must', 'pass', 'impossible', 'endurance', 'test', 'save', 'sister', 'life.The', 'main', 'problem', 'film', 'general', 'air', 'hokeyness', 'Boone', 'make', 'character', 'colorful', 'more', 'room', 'full', 'Gabby', 'Hayes', 'clones', 'character', 'given', 'rather', 'unglorious', 'sendoff', 'surprise', 'finale', 'big', 'climax', 'film', 'rest', 'cast', 'tries', 'direction', 'very', 'amateurish', 'script', 'weak', 'Many', 'scenes', 'drag', 'forever', 'characters', 'repeating', 'plot', 'points', 'again', 'again', 'kidnapping', 'tribe', 'origin', 'identity', 'never', 'explained', 'one', 'Native', 'American', 'who', 'can', 'speak', 'English', 'off', 'robot', 'version', 'Sacheen', 'Littlefeather', 'film', 'also', 'age', 'old', 'problem', 'many', 'action', 'films', 'run', 'journey', 'find', 'Charlotte', 'so', 'perilous', 'glossed-over', 'return', 'trip', 'home', 'have', 'gone', 'hitch.Watch', 'very', 'unconvincing', 'day', 'night', 'scenes', 'grainy', 'stock', 'footage', 'scattered', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'Against', 'Crooked', 'Sky', 'heart', 'be', 'right', 'place.This', 'rated', 'PG', 'physical', 'violence', 'gun', 'violence', 'mild', 'profanity', 'very', 'brief', 'female', 'nudity']",N/A

But Richard Boone is good as ""Russian,"" as well as the young Stewart Petersen as ""Sam Sutter,"" who feels responsible after his sister, ""Charlotte,"" is abducted by Indians, practically right from his hands, ultimately unable to keep himself from trying to track her down, even without a clue how, especially after Sam's Dad, ""John Sutter"" (Clint Ritchie), tries but doesn't get far (those darn coyotes!).  But then Sam persuades Russian (who saves his life at the beginning of his journey) to join him in his desperate plight to save Charlotte, so the mission transfers to Sam's shoulders, but how can he and Russian bring Charlotte back alive when they're so outnumbered by the Indians?  The dramatic ending is like a Western/Native-American symbolic collaboration, with the filmmakers doing their best with what little resources they had, but is effective, nonetheless.

I have two sisters and I would do the same thing for either one of them as Sam did for his sister.  It is true what Charlotte said at the beginning of the movie.  There is no greater love then to give your life for a friend.

Once he does, a situation develops and he discovers in order to save her life, he must sacrifice his own.  It is a race against the sun (literally) in his attempt to save his sister.The ending scene was so powerful.  We learn just how far that great love for a friend can reach and in a way that you would never expect.  The realization of the power of that love will make your heart weep in joy and sadness.  Without giving more of the ending away, let me just say this, there are so many emotionally filled dynamics to the last scene, I cried like a baby.There is one reason why this movie does not get 5 stars.  If you have not seen the movie, I would stop reading at this point.  I cannot understand why Charlotte ended up pregnant by the man who kidnapped her.  Did Charlotte accept her new life with this tribe and over time, fell in love with him?  That was the impression I got.

The kid who was apparently the star of the movie, (he got second billing), was stiff and wooden. Some of the time he didn't seem to participate, like he was watching the movie instead of in it. The reason I watched it was because it had decent reviews and because of Richard Boone and he was awful, but I guess he didn't have much to work with. I'm very surprised about all the high ratings. What were you people smoking?I love westerns, but this was just a bad movie! If you want to see a good movie with this plot watch John Wayne's ""The Searchers"" from 1956. One of Wayne's best.A couple of other comments: Movie reviews should be about the movie, not ""I'm giving it one star because I got a bad copy, or it arrived late, or it's the wrong region and I can't watch it"". These comments don't have anything to do with the movie. If there's a problem note it, but don't rate the movie low because of a technical problem. Also Amazon has a habit of using the date the DVD was released as the Release Date. Who cares when the DVD was released, I want to know when the movie was made.

You'll be glancing at your watch every 30 seconds, hoping it'll all be over before you suffer permanent brain damage.The only participant with any talent is Richard Boone, an accomplished and popular actor.
