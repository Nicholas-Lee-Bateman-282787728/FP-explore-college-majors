It's easily the most intense SAW film to date and one of the more intelligent plots. First off, I'm a big fan of all the SAW films but they went down in quality and got a bit slow on 4 and 5. SAW 6 keeps the complex plot from the last 2 while it also goes back into the horror and thriller genre. If you're familiar with the previous film, it starts off from the trap at the end where Peter Strahm and Mark Hoffman are in the trap. Strahm died from being crushed to death when trying to escape but Hoffman survived from being trapped in a glass box full of broken pieces.  William Easton, a health insurance executive is abducted by Hoffman for taking an advantage of others. He wakes up in an abandoned zoo with explosives strapped to all his limbs and he must go through all 4 traps or they'll all go off and his limbs will be dismembered. There's some subplots also such as flashbacks with John Kramer/Jigsaw and Jill trying to figure out who's behind the post-Jigsaw abductions",5,Best Film Since SAW III.,1325894400,"01 7, 2012",2012,1047,"['SAW', 'VI', 'more', 'graphic', 'violent', 'intense', 'follow-up', 'SAW', 'V.', 'easily', 'most', 'intense', 'SAW', 'film', 'date', 'one', 'more', 'intelligent', 'plots', 'First', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'SAW', 'films', 'went', 'down', 'quality', 'got', 'bit', 'slow', '4', '5', 'SAW', '6', 'complex', 'plot', 'last', '2', 'also', 'back', 'horror', 'thriller', 'genre', ""'re"", 'familiar', 'previous', 'film', 'trap', 'end', 'where', 'Peter', 'Strahm', 'Mark', 'Hoffman', 'are', 'trap', 'Strahm', 'died', 'being', 'crushed', 'death', 'when', 'trying', 'escape', 'Hoffman', 'survived', 'being', 'trapped', 'glass', 'box', 'full', 'broken', 'pieces', 'William', 'Easton', 'health', 'insurance', 'executive', 'abducted', 'Hoffman', 'taking', 'advantage', 'others', 'up', 'abandoned', 'zoo', 'explosives', 'strapped', 'limbs', 'must', 'go', '4', 'traps', ""'ll"", 'go', 'off', 'limbs', 'will', 'be', 'dismembered', 'subplots', 'also', 'such', 'flashbacks', 'John', 'Kramer/Jigsaw', 'Jill', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'post-Jigsaw', 'abductions']",Saw VI
1253057,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B00275EHFU,A. Estes,"[5, 6]","Say what you will aboutSawand its myriad of sequels. One simply cannot deny how resilient and durable this series has been throughout the better half of the decade. One could say this is theFriday the 13thorA Nightmare on Elm Streetfranchise of our time, and they wouldn't be wrong. Like such films, the sequels of ""Saw"" are made on a shoe-string budget, featuring virtually unknown actors, which in turns makes its studio a whole boat-load of money each year, which in turn greenlights the next sequel, narrative logic be damned. Lather, rinse, repeat. You get the idea.In the latest installment, ""Saw VI,"" John Kramer, a.k.a. Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) is still teaching his lessons to the morally corrupt from beyond the grave. With some careful pre-planning and the aid of a mentor or two, new traps are rolled out designed to test the will of its subjects. This time around, the plot takes a page from current events, as we find irresponsible lenders and negligent healthcare companies at the receiving end. No doubt, Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan's script requires a grain of salt to take down. For the first time, a ""Saw"" film gets topical and in turn, it's probably one of the easiest of the six to sit through, barring a rather gruesome opening scene that will have even the most seasoned horror fans squirming in their seat a bit. Fact of the matter is, the film is designed as pure escapism.Now, having said that, there are definitely a few key issues that make this one of the dullest saws in the toolbox. First off, the left-over plot fromSaw V (Unrated Director's Cut)is handled in an almost rushed, haphazard sort of way. It's like they wanted to get the Hoffman saga out of the way in order to focus on the carnage candy. The overall narrative suffers for it, as there are plot-holes abound and many questions still left in the air. Conversely, new twists and turns in the game are unearthed, but for the most part, feel forced and convoluted. The sad fact is that this franchise is running out of steam and is truly starting to show its age.As it stands, though, ""Saw VI"" is about as good as a sixth installment in any horror franchise has any right to be. It's not perfect, but the fans who have piled into the theaters in the past to see what Jigsaw had in store for them will more than likely walk away satisfied with this latest affair. It has the brains not to take itself as heavily as its predecessors, but at the same time, sacrifices much of the intelligence and intricacies this franchise has become known for. Enjoy it for what it is, and look out for Eddie Winslow of ""Family Matters"" fame himself, Darius McCrary in a minor role.",3,Game On...,1257120000,"11 2, 2009",2009,2656,"['Say', 'what', 'will', 'aboutSawand', 'myriad', 'sequels', 'One', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'deny', 'how', 'resilient', 'durable', 'series', 'been', 'better', 'half', 'decade', 'One', 'could', 'say', 'theFriday', '13thorA', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Streetfranchise', 'time', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'wrong', 'such', 'films', 'sequels', 'Saw', 'are', 'made', 'shoe-string', 'budget', 'featuring', 'virtually', 'unknown', 'actors', 'turns', 'studio', 'whole', 'boat-load', 'money', 'year', 'turn', 'greenlights', 'next', 'sequel', 'narrative', 'logic', 'be', 'damned', 'Lather', 'rinse', 'repeat', 'get', 'idea.In', 'latest', 'installment', 'Saw', 'VI', 'John', 'Kramer', 'a.k.a', 'Jigsaw', 'Tobin', 'Bell', 'still', 'teaching', 'lessons', 'morally', 'corrupt', 'grave', 'careful', 'pre-planning', 'aid', 'mentor', 'two', 'new', 'traps', 'are', 'rolled', 'out', 'designed', 'test', 'will', 'subjects', 'time', 'around', 'plot', 'page', 'current', 'events', 'find', 'irresponsible', 'lenders', 'negligent', 'healthcare', 'companies', 'receiving', 'end', 'doubt', 'Patrick', 'Melton', 'Marcus', 'Dunstan', 'script', 'grain', 'salt', 'take', 'down', 'first', 'time', 'Saw', 'film', 'topical', 'turn', 'probably', 'one', 'easiest', 'six', 'sit', 'barring', 'rather', 'gruesome', 'opening', 'scene', 'will', 'have', 'even', 'most', 'seasoned', 'horror', 'fans', 'squirming', 'seat', 'bit', 'Fact', 'matter', 'film', 'designed', 'pure', 'escapism.Now', 'having', 'said', 'are', 'definitely', 'few', 'key', 'issues', 'make', 'one', 'dullest', 'saws', 'toolbox', 'First', 'left-over', 'plot', 'fromSaw', 'V', 'Unrated', 'Director', 'Cut', 'handled', 'almost', 'rushed', 'haphazard', 'sort', 'way', 'wanted', 'get', 'Hoffman', 'way', 'order', 'focus', 'carnage', 'candy', 'overall', 'narrative', 'suffers', 'are', 'plot-holes', 'many', 'questions', 'still', 'left', 'air', 'Conversely', 'new', 'twists', 'turns', 'game', 'are', 'unearthed', 'most', 'part', 'feel', 'forced', 'convoluted', 'sad', 'fact', 'franchise', 'running', 'out', 'steam', 'truly', 'starting', 'show', 'age.As', 'though', 'Saw', 'VI', 'about', 'as', 'good', 'sixth', 'installment', 'horror', 'franchise', 'right', 'be', 'not', 'perfect', 'fans', 'who', 'have', 'piled', 'theaters', 'past', 'see', 'what', 'Jigsaw', 'had', 'store', 'will', 'more', 'likely', 'walk', 'away', 'satisfied', 'latest', 'affair', 'brains', 'not', 'take', 'as', 'heavily', 'predecessors', 'same', 'time', 'sacrifices', 'much', 'intelligence', 'intricacies', 'franchise', 'become', 'known', 'Enjoy', 'what', 'look', 'out', 'Eddie', 'Winslow', 'Family', 'Matters', 'fame', 'Darius', 'McCrary', 'minor', 'role']",Saw VI

1253060,A3327KH3Z7GZ1F,B00275EHFU,"Anthony L. Wallace ""ALW""","[2, 2]","By this point many people have either stuck with the franchise or have been worn out by the plot. However, it's important to understand that when the franchise began, it was purposely done to  make the plot last for a few sequels. When Saw V began, the plot was made to last till Saw VIII, if and only if, the previous film had made a decent amount of money. After Saw VI, it has become apparent that the fan base for the franchise has diminished due to low ticket sales. So at this point, with Saw VII opening in theatres in October 2010, if the movie has a low turnout then the series may inevitably end but the studio will be prepared to end it as if it is the last. Saw VI was to many a great improvement over it's predicessors (IV and V). Saw VI tied in lose ends and really looked in depth to Hoffman's and Jill Tucks psyches. At the same time, John's life and how he had been successful prior to being diagnosed with cancer is revealed. A little politics was thrown in with the healthcare issues that plagues America today, but maybe not to the same extent as how Saw VI portrays it as. Twists and turns throughout the film will keep you in focus and in the end will be making you want to see more. Kevin Greutart did a great job in his first directorial debut after editing the franchise since day one. Don't get me wrong, the Saw series may not be for everyone and not because of the gore and violence.

1253070,A26HD3S38PLD5A,B00275EHFU,"BO BO BOB ""WESLEY""","[2, 2]","This was probably the 2cnd best of the series, behind Part 2. One of the problems I have with this series is more philosophical. In this era of the surviving ""Super serial killer"", this movie more than any other makes a hero out of the serial killer in a sort of anti-hero-hero kind of way.  The victims are usually ""unscrupulous"" people, who these movies tell us ""deserve"" to be punished. The problem is the punisher is  a maniac serial killer. This is a cultural Hollywood movement beginning with the Friday the 13ths, Halloweens and TCMs; probably the first of the super serial killers/serial killer sequels.As a slasher flick fan, this was a great movie. Though NO. 6, it is fresh and creative. No Saw sequel would be complete without the voice and image of the original Jigsaw killer, with his raspy voice and thirst for vengeance. Of course, with the ending, Det Hoffman might live to kill again. Would've been nice if he had gotten his just reward in this one, leaving only the widow Jigsaw to carry on her departed serial-killer husband's legacy. With the exception of the first film in this series, they are all nail-biters, with fresh attention grabbing sped up endings, with something you did not expect to seal the deal.I can live without a Saw 7, but if they make it, I will buy it sight unseen, just as I did this one. I cannot think of another series that had at least 3 sequels, and each was worth buying. The only negative I would have about the Saw series is that I have purchased each individually, knowing that one day Amazon will offer the entire series for half the total of the individuals. This Saw may be number six in the series, but , to me, it is number two , pertaining to which is the best.",4,Saw VI Is No. 1,1265500800,"02 7, 2010",2010,1720,"['was', 'probably', '2cnd', 'best', 'series', 'Part', '2', 'One', 'problems', 'have', 'series', 'more', 'philosophical', 'era', 'surviving', 'Super', 'serial', 'killer', 'movie', 'more', 'other', 'hero', 'serial', 'killer', 'sort', 'anti-hero-hero', 'kind', 'way', 'victims', 'are', 'usually', 'unscrupulous', 'people', 'who', 'movies', 'tell', 'deserve', 'be', 'punished', 'problem', 'punisher', 'maniac', 'serial', 'killer', 'cultural', 'Hollywood', 'movement', 'beginning', 'Friday', '13ths', 'Halloweens', 'TCMs', 'probably', 'first', 'super', 'serial', 'killers/serial', 'killer', 'sequels.As', 'slasher', 'flick', 'fan', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'NO', '6', 'fresh', 'creative', 'Saw', 'sequel', 'would', 'be', 'complete', 'voice', 'image', 'original', 'Jigsaw', 'killer', 'raspy', 'voice', 'thirst', 'vengeance', 'course', 'ending', 'Det', 'Hoffman', 'might', 'live', 'kill', 'again', 'Would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'nice', 'had', 'gotten', 'just', 'reward', 'one', 'leaving', 'only', 'widow', 'Jigsaw', 'carry', 'departed', 'serial-killer', 'husband', 'legacy', 'exception', 'first', 'film', 'series', 'are', 'nail-biters', 'fresh', 'attention', 'grabbing', 'sped', 'up', 'endings', 'something', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'seal', 'deal.I', 'can', 'live', 'Saw', '7', 'make', 'will', 'buy', 'sight', 'unseen', 'just', 'did', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'think', 'series', 'had', 'least', '3', 'sequels', 'was', 'worth', 'buying', 'only', 'negative', 'would', 'have', 'Saw', 'series', 'have', 'purchased', 'individually', 'knowing', 'one', 'day', 'Amazon', 'will', 'offer', 'entire', 'series', 'total', 'individuals', 'Saw', 'may', 'be', 'number', 'six', 'series', 'number', 'two', 'pertaining', 'best']",Saw VI

But this latest Saw edition actually breathes a little bit of life into a dead franchise.  Let the review begin....Well heck, I'll skip going over the plot.  This is packed with more mind-numbing torture games like we've gotten accustomed too.  It does start with one of the most gruesome opening scenes I've ever Saw.  Stealing a scene from the movie Seven, Greed is a deadly sin.  Two not so lucky contestants are privy to a self-mutilation game, hacking and slicing off flesh in order to survive.  Whoever gives the most in 1 minute, wins.  Uhmm, of course nobody really wins, but the biggest giver gets a chance to survive.  Bloody revolting stuff!The movie carries on in much the same manner.  There are some horrible deaths we have to suffer through along with the victims.  Sick, sick, sick!  And speaking of the victims, these people are either loan officers or insurance agents.  They've been picked on before, but hey, they're easy targets.Jigsaw makes several appearances in this flick, the dude just refuses to die.  This actually just shows him in the pre-planning stages, all the elaborate traps he has to setup for his games to be a success.All in all, I think Saw VI was the best directed of all the sequels, except possibly Saw II.

1253076,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B00275EHFU,Chris Pandolfi,"[8, 11]","Funny, how perceptions change. ""Saw VI"" is pretty much the same film we've seen five times before, and yet, to my shock and amazement (and probably to yours as well), I found that I didn't hate or even dislike this movie. It's not good enough to recommend, but it's also not the terrible experience I had been expecting. My written reviews for ""Saw IV"" and ""Saw V"" were filled with animosity, mostly because the whole thing seemed like another case of sequel overload stemming from a horror film that wasn't all that good to begin with. For once, we have a ""Saw"" film that attempts to engage the audience, not only through a few clever revelations, but also through a none-too-subtle commentary on current political issues. It doesn't always succeed, but this time, I could tell that an effort was actually being made.All the same, it still suffers from a lot of the previous film's problems. I've never understood or agreed with the idea of continuing the story when the main antagonist, John Kramer, a.k.a. Jigsaw (Tobin Bell), has already died. When not shown in flashback, we see police lieutenant Mark Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) overseeing Jigsaw's ""master plan."" Can you imagine a ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" film in which Freddy Kruger is seen only in flashback? While someone else slices people open with razorblades for fingers? Never mind. There's also the fact that this is by no means a scary movie--it's impossible to be genuinely frightened by situations this preposterous. The gore is plentiful, and while I can't say I had been expecting anything less, I never really enjoyed looking at it. The story, while interesting, is also convoluted and hard to follow, with far too many subplots interwoven throughout.The central conflict involves William Easton (Peter Outerbridge), the sleazy executive of a health insurance company who grants or denies coverage based on the probability of a person's illness. In essence, he chooses who lives and who dies. Unfortunately, it's for this very reason that he ended up on Kramer's short list of people to be ""rehabilitated,"" and he soon finds himself trapped in yet another series of elaborate and painful traps, each more implausible than the last. In one, six of his junior co-workers find themselves chained to a rotating carousel, which periodically stops in front of a loaded shotgun; Easton has the power to prevent only two of them from getting blasted, so it becomes a matter of choosing who will live and who will die.Also trapped in Jigsaw's lair is Pamela Jenkins (Samantha Lemole), a shady reporter, and a mother and son (Shauna MacDonald and Devon Bostick) who, for reasons I won't reveal, share a connection with Easton. They wake up in a room rigged with a tank of hydrofluoric acid and a switchbox with the words ""live"" and ""die"" written on it.Another subplot, this one involving Kramer's widow, Jill Tuck (Betsey Russell), sheds some light on who she is and just how much she knew about her husband's extracurricular activities. I can't say I was completely satisfied with what was revealed, but hey, at least I got to see the contents of the box she was given in the last movie. We also learn a bit more about Kramer's oldest apprentice, Amanda Young (Shawnee Smith), and her strained affiliation with Hoffman.In the final subplot, The FBI, led by Dan Erikson (Mark Rolston) and a surprise survivor, are actively trying to discover the identity of the person continuing the Jigsaw killings. Hoffman tries to misdirect them by planting physical evidence linked to the late Peter Strahm. But the more Erikson and his team learn about Strahm, the less sense his involvement makes. One need only listen to the tone of Hoffman's voice to know that he's the culprit, but, unfortunately, convention dictates that law enforcement in horror movies know as little as possible until it's too late. Otherwise, the filmmakers wouldn't have an excuse to include more scenes of violent, bloody torture.And what of that? ""Saw VI"" opens with two predatory lenders in a Jigsaw trap, one they can only survive by ... well, let's just say it's similar in principle to ""The Biggest Loser,"" where the winner is the one who sheds the most pounds. Later on, someone melts before our eyes after being injected with lethal doses of acid. Some are shot, leaving gaping holes in their chests, while others have their heads impaled. I realize that the fans get a kick out of this, but really, isn't there a point where enough is enough? Fortunately, this movie takes the time to include more compelling story ideas, such as a flashback sequence in which Kramer astutely observes what most of us already know: Here in America, health is not determined by patients or doctors, but by insurance companies.The ending is the film's biggest miscalculation. The final five minutes play like an editing free-for-all, with revelations, flashbacks, lines of dialogue, and gruesome shots all merged together in a frenetic visual nightmare. It's so densely packed that it soon becomes impossible to figure out what's being revealed and why. In spite of this, it was still more thrilling than the ending to last year's film, which as advertised as being shocking beyond belief but didn't deliver as such. So there you have it. ""Saw VI,"" while not a great movie, at least shows signs that the series is heading in the right direction. For a horror movie, at least. If this trend continues, who knows what could happen? Maybe I'll actually recommend ""Saw VII.""",3,The Game Shows Signs of Improvement,1256342400,"10 24, 2009",2009,5487,"['Funny', 'how', 'perceptions', 'change', 'Saw', 'VI', 'pretty', 'much', 'same',

With appropriately-named director David Hackl out and series editor Kevin Greutert in it was a chance for a fresh approach. With better lighting, less aggressive editing and sound, and a far superior script Saw VI manages to be the best sequel. What a difference these small changes make.As I write this review the US government is currently shutdown because, in essence, the Republican's want poor people to die. The healthcare and insurance racket that US citizens are unfortunately stuck with is the end result of corporate greed and human evil. It's a situation wide open for satire and Saw VI nails it to the wall, however unsubtle.Picking up right after Agent Strahm has been crushed to death at the end of Saw V, the movie follows Detective Hoffman as he attempts to pull off Jiggy's last plan and distract the Feds from finding out who he really is. Flashbacks (a little more tastefully done this time, even though some of them have their own flashbacks) reveal that John Kramer was turned down by the Umbrella Insurance Corporation (er...do Capcom know about this?) for funding of experimental cancer treatment thanks to the small print.With Jiggy dead, Umbrella CEO William Easton thinks that he has been spared from his wrath. Wrong! Easton is kidnapped by Hoffman and thrown into a nerve-wracking gauntlet in which faces four tests to decide who from his team can live and who will die. It's a dilemma that he should be familiar with. So it shouldn't be too much trouble. Right?Of all Jiggy's victims William Easton is the best since Doctor Gordon, and his journey through an abandoned zoo, as he faces guilt and shame while saving his colleagues is very effective. A shame it is spoiled by the arrogant, teenage brat at the end. Even Detective Hoffman becomes a better character. By this point, in October 2009, I had written off the Saw series as V was really that bad. I only returned out of curiosity to see if we would finally find out what happened to Doctor Gordon. While that didn't happen Hoffman really takes over as a twisted, conflicted antagonist. I hated him in V. He's awesome in VI.This sixth installment really does get the series back on track. The usual faults are still in there, but they are thankfully dialed down.The Blu-ray presents the film in 1.78:1 1080p which looks so good it highlights the pathetic, post-production tinkering to the point where the amateur photoshopping done to conceal the bags beneath Betsy Russell's eye are blatantly obvious.

This time I am going to be straight-forward.While I thought SAW V (2008) was very well made and left us with a doozy of a cliff-hanger making you yearn for more, I was very disappointed with the next movie, SAW VI (2009).From the very beginning of the film with two people (Tandera Howard, Marty Moreau) in their cells and traps, I thought it was very badly edited and the consequences of the trap was very bland.  It looked like something put together by an amateur for You Tube and so meaningless to the continuing story of SAW.The usual pattern and story build-up, as inSaw II (Full Screen Edition)(2005) and SAW V 2008), is not here in SAW VI which I believe is just a mess.  The sets are small and so uninteresting.The color-bleaching of scenes is really getting out of hand and annoying to watch.  The hand-held camera scenes irk me with the constant shaking around.The construction of scenes in the film just jump from one sub-plot to the next so quickly their are no long dramatic, intense scenes to enjoy (as the now-classic one in SAW V between Hoffman at gunpoint with John alone).The way this movie was filmed is just terrible and too many quick shots that make you blink and unnecessary quick archive shots put in the film to fill the running time.The writing of this film is poorly done.If you were hoping to find out what happened to the characters of Mallick (Greg Bryk) and Brit (Julie Benz), they are not in this film.You will notice in the scenes as Costas Mandylor was being lowered in the coffin and comes out, he has had some weight loss between films.Congratulations, Costas! You look great!You will find out what is in the box given to Jill (Betsy Russell) and her purpose in this film is very predictable if you haven't already figured it out while watching SAW V (2008).The story finally begins when a health insurance executive (Peter Outerbridge) is turning down insurance claims for those in medical need.  The man is rotten to the core.  As you can guess, he is kidnapped by someone in the pig head and becomes the latest victim to play ""the game"".  The other victims are people that work for him, but are senselessly killed.I throughly enjoy Costas Mandylor as ""Hoffman"" and he is a box-office draw, but the ending of SAW VI was very unsatisfactory to me and their finale idea, in my opinion, premature for the longevity of the SAW film series.They attempted to create a victim you would dislike while at the same time you might actually root for Hoffman, the killer.Costas Mandylor made the SAW film series much more interesting to watch, but we will have to wait until SAW 7 3D (2010) to find out if Hoffman survives.The story is flat, but it does tie up the loose ends and while ""Game Over"" was said, not until the next movie SAW: The Final Chapter (2010) does it all end...for now.The SAW film series:Saw(2004)Saw II (Full Screen Edition)(2005)Saw III - Unrated (Full Screen Edition)(2006)Saw IV (Unrated Full Screen Edition)(2007)Saw V (Unrated Director's Cut)(2008)Saw VI (Widescreen Unrated Edition)(2009)Saw: The Final Chapter(2010).Update: As of March 2014, Executive Producer, Daniel J.

Enjoy.A sadistic sociopath, similar to the one in Se7en, with an affinity for engineering, likes to play lethal games, forcing his victims - those he deems unappreciative of life - into an existential choice inside a million dollars worth of engineering and machinery.Saw SIX begins with ONE person trapped in an abandoned ZOO.  Forced to play the killer's (Tobin Bell as John ""Jigsaw"" Kramer) game, HEALTH INSURANCE EXECUTIVE WILLIAM EASTON (Peter Outerbridge) has to prove his will to live, and his ability to MEASURE LIFE'S WORTH.  Meanwhile, FBI AGENTS DAN ERICKSON (Mark Rolston) and LINDSEY PEREZ (Athena Karkanis), and rugged veteran DET. MARK HOFFMAN (Costas Mandylor) are investigating as a team, but MARK HOFFMAN may be (is still) in too deep.  As the law grows increasingly closer to ensnaring Jigsaw's successor, the game participant learns that WILLIAM may be an implicit accomplice to their abduction, and his situation provides a choice between WITNESSING MORBID CONTRAPTIONS or guaranteed death.  To help his cause, cryptic clues left via mini cassette tape lead him (aka a life perpetrator) towards the precipice of twisted rehabilitation or a potential tomb.Several previous murderous contraptions like the OXYGEN TRAP (for a SMOKER WITH HEART DISEASE), the BARBED WIRE NOOSE (for an ORPHAN WITH NO FAMILY), and the CAROUSEL (for BACKSTABBING INTERNS) provide horror fodder in the form of viscera and blood spatter, while other traps - like the POUND OF FLESH TRAP - are inserted for the same reason Spock and Kirk always took ensign Jones on away parties (someone in the situation needs to die horribly).  Climax and cliffhanger are in quick succession, flashbacks provide necessary details, the viewer learns more about JIGSAW'S LEGACY, and on to Saw VII.Jason Elin",4,Saw VI - Cancel my health insurance policy!?

Jigsaw forces him to make those decisions for his screaming and begging co-workers and friends because the insurance man's numbers crunching formulas don't include the ""will to live"" factor.Keep on watching after the credits roll or you will miss something.

1253103,ARK323I3EV98D,B00275EHFU,Jordan D. Wilson,"[2, 9]","I don't know if you've heard yet, but the newest edition to the seemingly endless Saw franchise is the first one to broach the subject of healthcare and the current state of the system in America. Many may have looked at this as a clever turn for the series, and there is some amusing satire, such as the ""death panel"" facing its doom, but to me it just came off as an arrogant attempt to make a disgusting, gratuitous movie seem ""relevant.""Opening directly where the fifth movie left off, Saw VI follows two or three or twelve (I really can't be sure) very messy plot lines. One follows around Jigsaw's newest pupil, FBI Detective Hoffman (Costas Mandylor), who is attempting to cover up all of his tracks so as to continue on his merry way. Jigsaw's wife, Jill (Betsy Russell), is also a key component throughout this story, and many loose ends surrounding John Kramer's will and purpose are somewhat tied up, however by this point I didn't really care enough to be moved by any of the twists. They repeatedly caused me to shrug and say out loud ""Okay. Why?"" There was a bit more rhyme and reason in this entry to the series than in the past few, but that is really not saying much.Another more central plot line involves the head of a health insurance company being forced to choose whom to give ""coverage"" to. He is faced with numerous challenges in his path to freedom, and he has to make some tough and painful choices, as is custom with these movies. As usual, the torture, violence and gore are relentless, and I found myself having to look away at times. There is one scene in which Tobin Bell's performance is unworthy of the rest of the film. The same thing happened in Saw V, in his confrontation with Hoffman. This leads me to believe that Bell should move on and do some different movies. I would like to see him try something else other than, ""Live or die? Make your choice.""I decided to watch Saw VI only because the other reviews I have read have been fairly decent in comparison to the previous movies. It is, in fact, the best-reviewed entry since the first, which I liked. I can see now that many people are easily lured into thinking that because the newest bit of torture-porn ""gets political"" that it is worth taking a look at and even praising. But let me tell you, it is not worth looking at, nor does it present anything worthy of praise. Saw VI is merely another filthy, bloody piece of convoluted trash.I mentioned the premise, along with my thoughts on the film, to Roger Ebert on his web blog.

1253106,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B00275EHFU,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[0, 3]","Let me ask you a question. Would you continue to watch a movie franchise once it became clear that the series was going downhill? My guess is that most people would probably have given up on the series after the initial signs of distress became obvious. Apparently I must be a glutton for punishment, because even though the ""Saw"" franchise has been on a steady decline since ""Saw 4"", with initial signs appearing as early as the second film, I still decided to rent the latest installment.""Saw 6"" finds Detective Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) implementing a new game, as a part of the late Jigsaw's (Tobin Bell) final wishes. Choosing the victims from files given to him by Jigsaw's widow (Betsy Russell), Hoffman begins setting up his elaborate traps; however, his work at continuing Jigsaw's grisly legacy may soon be coming to an end. As their investigation benefits from new breaks in the case, the FBI is getting closer and closer to uncovering the identity of Jigsaw's mysterious accomplice, prompting Hoffman to become even more unhinged and paranoid at every turn. After so much death and carnage, could Jigsaw's deadly game be nearly over?So, after five previous entries into the increasingly monotonous ""Saw"" franchise, does the sixth one offer anything interesting or noteworthy to the series? The answer, a resounding... not really (anti-climactic, I know).The story, written by returning screenwriters Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan (""Saw 4 and 5""), contains all of the familiar trademarks of the franchise, such as: torturous traps, the creepy puppet, a convoluted plot, victims that need to be taught a lesson, and of course appearances by Jigsaw (despite the fact that he died three movies ago). Most of these elements have become so clich&eacute;d that any intrigue or originality that one could gleam from them has long since been forgotten.The traps, although they've always been chilling, to say the least, have become less inventive. What had been the writers' sole remaining outlet of creativity (as of ""Saw 4"") has now become tiresome and bland. This isn't helped by the fact that the traps now appear to drive the story rather than the other way around. Prior to this film it had seemed like the traps were merely plot devices to string together the various plot threads throughout the movie. With this movie, every aspect of these films has become a dull, uninteresting exercise in gratuitous violence and bloodshed.Speaking of the plot, not only are new plot points becoming increasingly sparse between death traps, but the overall story for the series is now a boring, jumbled heap. The incessant usages of flashbacks to fill in supposed gaps in not just this film's story, but those that came before it as well, has made the entire franchise an overly complicated and convoluted mess that is nearly impossible to comprehend.Some movie franchises have used flashbacks with great success, but the problem with this series is that the flashbacks are employed to rewrite the series' history. In essence, they insert events, people, and places into the characters' pasts that never existed before. It's one thing to show a flashback for additional exposition, it's another to simply retcon previous story threads in order to extend the life of a series so obviously undeserving of survival.I will say two positive things for this movie's storyline. First, just as its predecessors have done in the past, the final moments of the movie benefited from an enhanced level of intensity. This newfound momentum, consisting of all of ten, maybe 15 minutes, effectively snapped me out of the nearly catatonic stupor the rest of the movie had induced. Too bad the other 80 minutes of the movie couldn't have been as interesting as its closing moments; if they had been, then this would have been a sequel potentially worth watching. Well, then again ...maybe not.Second, this film's story attempts to bring the overarching story threads for the entire ""Saw"" series to a close. Granted, I doubt this will be the last entry into the ""Saw"" franchise, in fact, I believe another installment has already been announced for release in 2010. However, maybe the next movie will take the series in an all-new direction allowing for this current story arc to end. That way, I won't feel this pathetic compulsion to continue watching this dreadful series in hopes of an eventual ending that may or may not ever occur.The cast for this film is just as uninteresting and unremarkable as the series itself has become. All of the victims are newcomers to the series, some of which you may recognize from various TV shows and/or bit parts in other movies. Either way, their work here in this film will do nothing to garner them any future work in my opinion. Once again, most of the victims you learn very little about prior to their capture and subsequent involvement in the game. What you do learn about them comes courtesy of a few brief glimpses of them at their job. They all work at a massive insurance corporation with questionable policy practices. With that knowledge you already care very little for any of them, so any sympathy for the characters and their terrible plight is not easily achieved beyond the fact that no one should have to suffer in such a horrible way. Typically, horror movies try to make at least one or two of the victims likeable, something the writers of this franchise apparently never learned.There are a few returning cast members, some of which haven't been seen in quite some time (at least, not in new footage). Costas Mandylor, as I've stated about his performance in the previous two films, continues to seem uninterested in his role as Jigsaw's apprentice, Detective Hoffman. While he does seem more comfortable as the villain, his acting is too strained and awkward in appearance. The man apparently cannot play any aspect of his character subtly. Everything he does is forced and any attempt at subterfuge his character conveys is almost painful to watch. His performance is but another example of how far this series has fallen after the events of the third film.Other returning cast members include Tobin Bell (of course) and a slightly oversized cameo appearance by Shawnee Smith, both portraying characters that died in ""Saw 3"". Tobin Bell as the late killer, Jigsaw, is somehow getting more time in front of the camera in this movie than he had in the previous two installments via flashbacks (this is three movies past his death, mind you). This tells me that the writers are beginning to run low on the story threads that they implemented when they took over the franchise in ""Saw 4"" and now need to use more and more flashbacks to create new threads no matter how contrived their inclusion may be. That being said, Tobin is still the best actor in the franchise and he appears to have resigned himself to his current status within this thankless series; thus, allowing him to relish in his character's malevolence once more.Shawnee Smith's reprisal as Amanda, Jigsaw's first apprentice, only exists to make the retconning of the series' history seem more official. Even then, her character wasn't really necessary to show on screen. My guess is that Shawnee needed work; the writers needed a few minutes to fill within their story, the two parties talked, and the rest you can see for yourself.Overall, this is a disappointing movie that is only slightly better than the previous two films in the series. While, ""Saw 6"" presents the franchise with the potential to bring closure to the series in a somewhat satisfactory manner; the remainder of the movie makes for one extremely tedious experience. Perhaps the mantra of this series should be applied to the series itself. After all, it is a franchise that has taken its existence for granted and therefore, needs to be taught a lesson or die trying.""Saw 6"" is available in rated R and unrated editions, both contain

Hopefully we will finally find out about Dr. Gordon from Saw in Saw 7 coming out later this year!

1253111,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00275EHFU,Mark Turner,"[0, 1]","WARNING:major plot line spoilers are found here, but not revelations that would spoil your viewing the film.Fans of the SAW films have seen the series change from one where we were presented with a puzzle of our own to solve (why were these two men chained in a small room and who was doing it?) into a series of ghastlier deaths involving torture devices. Face it, the main reason people go to see the SAW series is no longer the story line but to see the death sequences. We watch with some strange, sick interests feeling guilty about it all the way...but we watch anyway.The original film was a treat with enough back story to keep your interest and try to figure out what was going on. Each progressive episode in the series changed to the torture devices. But there was something more, something that takes up less screen time perhaps, but that does exists between the gory spectacles.There is the story of a man, John/Jigsaw (Tobin Bell), who has placed these people in harms way. But not without reason, at least in his mind. Each person has done something wrong in their life and John now gives them the opportunity to atone for their sins, to start fresh and to hopefully learn their lesson. So rather than a simple uncaring murderer at the heart of the series, we instead have a murderer who tracks down and does harm to people who have harmed others. Talk about an anti-hero.Sadly that seems to be the case with so many horror icons these days. Freddy Krueger changed from a child molester into a joke spewing stand up comedian killing teens. Jason Voorhees changed twice, from the mother who was the killer initially into the deformed boy mass murderer and later into a somewhat sympathetic killer who did so because of how he was treated. Jigsaw is just the latest to transform.This time around we are still seeing John/Jigsaw at the helm although he died several films back. But John wasn't short sighted, planning things in advance and putting into play others who would see to it that his plans were carried out. With his assistant Amanda (Shawnee Smith) out of the picture, it falls on to Det. Mark Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) to continue as he did in the last film.Unfortunately the players involved on the receiving end have filtered down to those with the most distant connection to deserving punishment. Well that and we get the chance to attack the insurance industry at an opportune time with all the talk of health care at this time in history.It seems (as we find discover while the film plays out) that John was denied coverage of an experimental treatment for his cancer. The man in charge whose formula decided who did and did not receive treatment is now the main subject in the game of car and mousetrap. William (Peter Outerbridge) is the corporate insurance man whose decisions have affected many. Now he begins the arduous task of going through various traps set by the new Jigsaw in payment for allowing the original to perish.As he moves from one trap to the next, involving self mutilation to save his life, his puzzles involve people close to him. In each case he has to choose which ones live and which ones die, some innocent and others guilty of their own sins. Not quite how the series began. Each trap does reveal something about those involved in the game. Some choose to help those trapped as well while others attempt to short circuit the game to save only themselves. As he moves through, William learns his lesson and sets aside his own body to save others.While he makes his way through the traps we have two other threads moving along as well. A woman and her son are in a cell of their own with a vat of acid and a switch that reads live or die on it. Knowing William has a family one can only assume this is his wife and son. Or are they? Keep in mind, this is SAW and often people aren't who we think they are. But then again, sometimes they are.In another cell is a young reporter who was trying to reach William. She is in a cell much like that of the mother and son. How is she connected to it all?The second thread involves the new Jigsaw. Hoffman is revealed to have put in play motives of his own. Having been required by all of those whose lives touched John to face his own demons, Hoffman escaped that trap. But he changed the game in several ways. And as the detectives investigating the truth behind Jigsaw come closer and closer to finding the real killer, Hoffman must not only stay in control of the game in play but insure that the investigators don't discover who he is.So, with all that said, is SAW 6 a good or a bad movie? On the whole I'd have to say it's a good one in the series. The stories meld together to form a cohesive plot that makes sense. Toss in John's wife into the mix with more plans from John and many of the loose threads from the entire series are explained. While the insurance angle seems a bit contrived and while the opportunities to redeem one self seem lessened, the main idea remains intact.For fans of the gore the movie offers plenty. For fans of the story, we get some closure along the way. But yes, as with all good franchises, the ending leaves an opening that promises there will be another. Word has it they're already planning the next one in 3-D. So now rather than simply spilling guts, perhaps they'll spill into the laps of the audience.One thing is certain. If the next film doesn't off as much story as the rest and instead relies on gore and effects, the franchise will die. But if it takes on the story as much as this one does, we'll see not only SAW 7 but SAW 8 as well.An extra note, the edition I purchased included a blu-ray copy of the first film as well.

I actually laughed at the acting it was so bad, and it never stopped. I mean common...you put ""Eddie Winslow"" in a horror film and expect people to take it seriously? Who's going to star in Saw 7(yes they are making ANOTHER one)Urkel?Saw VI was boring, predictable, and pretty much the same as all the others although watered down a lot, and when I say watered down I mean the plot. The mind bending story isn't there at all. Nothing like the first few films that make you think WoW I didn't see that happening. This one is empty... the only real shocker is finding out about the family of the main victim. I guess that one was a surprise but still not a mind blower.I like the Saw horror films, but now I think it's time to give it a rest. Saw is now officially in its Batman and Robin phase(yes,the one with George Cloony). If there is a movie that's not worth wasting your time on it is this. It's pointlessly gory because unlike the original Saw and very few ""sequels"" you feel absolutely no connection with the victims. They're just random people getting killed now in akward ways. Saw has came a long way from the Danny Glover days. Now it's just ""made for TV"" grade acting and a hack and slash gore fest that's so pointless it would make Jason himself walk off the set and drown himself to death.....again.Overall this movie is crap.

I was pumped for number 2 and actually enjoyed it quite a bit, I thought were climbing a hill of movie goodness here.  Saw III followed and was interesting to say the least, I was happy it improved over on the 1st and 2nd and kept me interested in 4.  Needless to say  4 and 5 plummeted the series like a skydive gone wrong...I was officially done with Saw after seeing 5.Last week I fell to the curiosity of Saw 6 and decided to see it that weekend.  I went into the theater with my 6 dollar soda, and 5 dollar skittles, sat through the 4 or so teenagers next to me giggling and talking through the entire 91 minute movie...then came the end credits.I can honestly say after all was said and done my friends and I looked at each other with ear to ear grins.  I was very happy with this 6th installment, and didn't feel so bad about the 20+ dollars I had spent to see this movie.  The opening scene is brutal and has you sitting back in your seat thinking OUCH!  The movie throws in some real world situations that most people can relate to or at least see the truth in.In my mind a lot of things were answered and blanks filled in from the last couple movies, which I felt helped number 6 a lot.  And the new director didn't clam up and make this one borderline PG-13, the gore is very well done and makes even me, a horror fanatic cringe.  I'm not gonna discuss the plot, or twists, because I think you should feel how I did when they play out on screen.I will say when it comes to Saw 6, forgive and forget the last 2 and see this one!  If your a Saw fan your gonna love this new installment, if you were a Saw fan this will re-ignite your Saw fascination, and at least get your heart pumping and mind racing as to what the next installment will include!

It's neat how they managed to connect characters and storylines throughout all six chapters. I'd hate to be the writers keeping all that stuff straight. The acting was better than normal for a SAW flick and I never got bored like I did with IV and V. As far as the gore is concerned, SAW VI has its brutal moments, but the traps are rather tame compared to some of the others in the series. The opening scene was very gruesome and it seemed like it would never end.Sure the whole things is getting really old now and the traps are basically more of the same, but the little twists along the way caught me off guard.

In the meantime, it is learned just what Jill (Betsy Russell) has been harboring, and there's naturally more grisly scenes of torture to be found as well.  While Saw V represented the lowest point the series has gone so far, Saw VI manages to be somewhat better in the sense of pure film making.  Plus, seeing Shawnee Smith return as Amanda is kind of grin-inducing, and if the opening trap scene doesn't make you cringe, nothing will.  However, as a whole, Saw VI is still an exercise in pure sadism, and as such, it is an ultimately empty entry in the now way too-long running franchise.

It was approximately 10 minutes of pure gore.  When I first saw this in the theater I was really starting to get bored, while I love gore I was just thinking that they had run out of ideas but then the movie really starts and it starts to wrap up a lot of stuff that happened in the previous movies.  This movie moves at a very fast pace and by the end you walk away from it completely satisfied.The plot revolves around insurance companies and their denying people coverage for incurable diseases and always finding ways to get out of having to pay any claims.  They will take your money but when you need them they will decline coverage, sound familiar?*******Slight Spoiler in the paragraph below******************I really liked this aspect of the film, dealing with a real problem that we have today in the US as well as focusing on our corrupt police officer continuing jigsaw's work and the test that he is going to be put through.**************************************************************I think this movie really pushed this series forward and answered many unanswered questions from the past.

I am done with Darren Lynn Bousman and his ragtag crew of castoffs dancing on the bones of James Wan's first Saw film, which at the time was one of the coolest things I'd seen in years. Saw II was at least watchable, though the drop in quality was pretty radical, and the series has gone steadily downhill since. I assume the new bent in the screenplay (they attempted to attach some moral weight to this round of torture and death) was meant as a way to revitalize the series; it does nothing but add cement shoes; leading us to the sea floor all the quicker. And good riddance.Plot: a bunch of heath insurance executives and related ancillaries (such as one of the company's lawyers) are put into a bunch of Jigsaw traps, and the head of the company has to run the gauntlet, deciding who to kill and who to save. There are, of course, a bunch of stupid cops who can't stop the game in time, and there is, of course, a twist ending that you'll be able to see coming a mile off (after all, the big twist ending has been a trademark of the series; if you've seen the other five and haven't figured out how this works yet, you're just not paying attention).Yes, there are some amusingly grim death scenes, which is what the series has been about since the second movie, and I am now actually thinking (it's been about a week since I saw it) that had they not tried to inject globs of social commentary into the movie, I might have written it off in the same way I've written off all of them since the third, as a bit of mindless fluff with no value whatever except as a way to kill ninety minutes, preferably while drinking copious amounts of alcohol to avoid all the stupidity in the dialogue. But no, new director Kevin Greutert (who's been an editor for the other five) and scriptwriting team Marcus Dunstan and Patrick Melton (Feast, as well as the last three Saw flicks) decided they wanted to make some sort of statement about healthcare reform. Which is actually kind of funny when you think about it. A torture-porn healthcare reform statement. It also shows the vast changes in scope from the first movie. All Jigsaw was interested in back then was changing the mind of one doctor. Now he wants to take on the entire healthcare industry. Well, I guess it doesn't hurt to have ideals. Just don't be surprised when they fail miserably. *",1,Tell me why I keep putting myself through this?,1259539200,"11 30, 2009",2009,2382,"['Saw', 'VI', 'Kevin', 'Greutert', '2009', 'am', 'done', 'Darren', 'Lynn', 'Bousman', 'ragtag', 'crew', 'castoffs', 'dancing', 'bones', 'James', 'Wan', 'first', 'Saw', 'film', 'time', 'was', 'one', 'coolest', 'things', ""'d"", 'seen', 'years', 'Saw', 'II', 'was', 'least', 'watchable', 'drop', 'quality', 'was', 'pretty', 'radical', 'series', 'gone', 'steadily', 'downhill', 'assume', 'new', 'bent', 'screenplay', 'attempted', 'attach', 'moral', 'weight', 'round', 'torture', 'death', 'was', 'meant', 'way', 'revitalize', 'series', 'nothing', 'add', 'cement', 'shoes', 'leading', 'sea', 'floor', 'quicker', 'good', 'riddance.Plot', 'bunch', 'heath', 'insurance', 'executives', 'related', 'ancillaries', 'such', 'one', 'company', 'lawyers', 'are', 'put', 'bunch', 'Jigsaw', 'traps', 'head', 'company', 'run', 'gauntlet', 'deciding', 'who', 'kill', 'who', 'save', 'are', 'course', 'bunch', 'stupid', 'cops', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'game', 'time', 'course', 'twist', 'ending', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'see', 'coming', 'mile', 'off', 'big', 'twist', 'ending', 'been', 'trademark', 'series', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'five', 'have', ""n't"", 'figured', 'out', 'how', 'yet', ""'re"", 'just', 'not', 'paying', 'attention', '.Yes', 'are', 'amusingly', 'grim', 'death', 'scenes', 'what', 'series', 'been', 'second', 'movie', 'am', 'now', 'actually', 'thinking', 'been', 'week', 'saw', 'had', 'not', 'tried', 'inject', 'globs', 'social', 'commentary', 'movie', 'might', 'have', 'written', 'off', 'same', 'way', ""'ve"", 'written', 'off', 'third', 'bit', 'mindless', 'fluff', 'value', 'way', 'kill', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'preferably', 'drinking', 'copious', 'amounts', 'alcohol', 'avoid', 'stupidity', 'dialogue', 'new', 'director', 'Kevin', 'Greutert', 'who', 'been', 'editor', 'other', 'five', 'scriptwriting', 'team', 'Marcus', 'Dunstan', 'Patrick', 'Melton', 'Feast', 'as', 'well', 'last', 'three', 'Saw', 'flicks', 'decided', 'wanted', 'make', 'sort', 'statement', 'healthcare', 'reform', 'Which', 'actually', 'kind', 'funny', 'when', 'think', 'torture-porn', 'healthcare', 'reform', 'statement', 'also', 'vast', 'changes', 'scope', 'first', 'movie', 'Jigsaw', 'was', 'interested', 'back', 'then', 'was', 'changing', 'mind', 'one', 'doctor', 'Now', 'take', 'entire', 'healthcare', 'industry', 'Well', 'guess', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'have', 'ideals', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'when', 'fail', 'miserably', '*']",Saw VI

1253127,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B00275EHFU,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[3, 3]","Saw VI is the movie that definitively establishes that the series is primed to go forward and succeed even after the deaths of all the major characters from the first few chapters, Jigsaw included.  Although Jigsaw and the others will most likely continue to be part of the story in flashbacks and the like, and a couple of the 'dead' characters, I recently realized, are more in the 'presumed dead' category and could conceivably resurface, the game now belongs to Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) and Jill (Betsy Russell).It had looked like Jill (John Kramer's aka Jigsaw's ex-wife) role in the series had played itself out, but her character is revitalized here through flashbacks (a Saw staple, obviously) and the revelation of just what was in that mystery box we saw her get at John's will reading in Saw V.  As for Hoffman, he's seemingly won the game.  He's cleared himself of suspicion in the Jigsaw murders through his framing of another agent in Saw V, has been hailed as a hero for his role in stopping the Jigsaw murders and saving the life of the little girl whose fate was left hanging at the end of Saw III, and is free to either walk away or continue the game in whatever direction he alone chooses.  Only one detail needs wrapping up, his last assignment from Jigsaw, a new group of individuals to be tested.  This, though, will turn out to be only one of a series of games to play out simultaneously in Saw VI.Hoffman has broken out in this movie and emerged as a worthy lead for the Saw series (although after having recently rewatched the previous five Saw chapters right before this one, I'd already changed my opinion and decided that I was previously too hard both on Saw V and on the Hoffman character.  More on that in a minute.)  Now, whether he's going to be around to carry on his lead role through subsequent entries, or whether the movie that really makes him will be his swan song as well, you'll have to watch to find out.  Nobody is safe in the Saw movies, if they can kill Jigsaw and Amanda and keep going they can kill anybody off.  And the way they get away with it is they keep successfully launching new players into the mix, as well as taking bit-part players from the earlier chapters and expanding their roles.  But here, especially with having rewatched the others shortly beforehand, we get a full picture of Hoffman as a very different 'games-master' than Jigsaw, or Amanda, for that matter.  Through the flashbacks we trace the character's development from way back before the Jigsaw murders ever began - from dark but basically 'good guy' cop frustrated with the failings of the justice system and the rampant crimes he sees every day, through to increasingly corrupt cop, to self-styled vigilante and member of Jigsaw's inner circle, and finally right over the edge to a total psychopath.The acting, effects, and distinctive dark atmosphere of the series are all in full force here.  There are some potential problems, although it's possible to explain some of them away.  The large group of participants for the final game Jigsaw assembled before his death is one point that juts out at you.  The lives of innocents are put in direct jeopardy, in contrast to Jigsaw's established rules for testing only those who he's deemed sufficiently guilty of some crime or shortcoming as to merit it.  Knowing the Saw series though, the way a seemingly minor incident in Part 1 or 2 will be picked up on a couple chapters down the road and given new signifigance, maybe they'll explain what these innocents actually did to tick Jigsaw off in Saw IX or something.  That's not a criticism - I'm impressed by the way seemingly small acts turn out later to play major roles in this series.  Another possibility is that Hoffman simply changed the rules from Jigsaw's original instructions and added more people in at his own discretion.  Something else that could be seen as a flaw is that some of the traps seem 'too accurate'.  For example, for it to work there would seemingly have to be some way for Hoffman to know exactly where in a room someone would be standing at a given time.  I suppose it's possible that the new traps are equipped with motion sensors or something and can silently shift their aim.  There are various little points like this, like there were in Saw V, where you can think of a potential explanation, but overall even I have to admit they could tighten up these potential kinks a bit.  They weren't glaring enough to detract significantly from the movie, at least not when you can come up with something in your own head to explain it.I wanted to touch briefly on the Saw series as a whole and on this chapter's place in it.  Watching all six over a short period of time really gave me a sense of how strong the series is on characterization.  I'm impressed by the number of characters that are initially good guys but turn out to have some 'flaw' or secret dark side - this doesn't always take them away from the good guy role, it just builds them up.  Likewise, many characters who seem to be straight bad guys are given some redeeming quality as the series goes on (although certainly not all of them).  The result is a cast of very nuanced, very complex characters, where black and white are still present but competing shades of grey also struggle for dominance.  And as I mentioned earlier, the way a small event in an early film takes on great importance later on is powerful.  We see a lot of that here in Saw VI.  Also, while this Is a step up from Saw V, Saw V on the rewatch was actually better than I initially gave it credit for (I gave it a three-star rating and said that I liked it, but it was by far the least of the series.  I hearby revise that to 4 stars, and say that while it may actually be the least powerful of the bunch, it doesn't fall That far behind).  I also said in reviewing Saw V that it seemed that they didn't really know where they were going, but I hoped I was wrong and it turned out they had a way to stitch everything together better.  Well, having seen Saw VI, I see that I Was wrong, they did indeed know where they were going and it just took a little while to get there.  So I happily stand corrected.  I've praised Costas Mandylor's performance in Saw VI, but just in rewatching Part 5 I saw things there I didn't before.  Maybe it was the benefit of seeing 1-4 in the days beforehand and thereby being able to see how details connected.  I never had a problem with Mandylor's acting, I just didn't 'get' the character the way I now do.In short, Saw VI is a great chapter with a couple of glitches in an overall great series, a series that lends itself very well to rewatching for all the subtlties.  And if you don't normally watch right through the end credits, make sure you do this time - there's a coda at the end that adds a new angle.",5,The Game Evolves,1269820800,"03 29,

Well, keeping the tradition alive I watched SAW VI today and I have to say I'm glad I did. Was it awesome? Absolutely not. But it was a thousand times better than Saw V. As far as I was concerned, V broke with the traditional time-shifting in the plot and also the ""twist"" ending was a joke. Without giving anything away, I think that VI was much more like the original movies than V. However, it still wasn't in any way better than any of the first few. Was there a twist or two? Of course. Was something new (or multiple somethings) ""revealed""? Absolutely. Was there ""time shifting"" in the story, you'll need to see for yourself and make up your own mind. What I mean by that is, with all the flashbacks, you could argue either way. So, bottom line, if you liked the movies up to now and want to see what happens next, check it out.

Saw VI is just one more trip on a ride that lost its excitement four films ago as it constantly tries to reinvent itself and retcon its history.  For a guy who's been dead for three films, Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) gets a tremendous amount of screen time, more than even Costas Mandylor, returning as Detective Hoffman.  Jigsaw's big gripe this time around is with predatory mortgage lenders and insurance companies.Now look, both of these groups may have their unscrupulous side, but if Jigsaw wants to help couldn't he go after a few murderers, child molesters, or the occasional terrorist?  Mortgage lenders may be scumbags but that doesn't mean we need to see them cut off their own body parts in order to survive as they do in the opening scene as an obese guy and woman have to cut of the most weight in order to win the game.  Give the girl points for intelligence...she merely severs her own arm...hey it can be re-attached, while the fat guy begins cutting off his own stomach.  Sorry if that's spoiling it but hey, it spoiled my dinner watching it.In flashbacks we see John/Jigsaw turned down by his insurance company when he wants to try an experimental procedure.  He's told if he goes through with it, it will void his policy.  And here's the kicker...John states it's not about the money...he has plenty of that...it's about the principal involved.  Gee, welcome to the real world Jigsaw.It's later that this Insurance Executive, William Easton ends up in Jigsaws game...since he has the power to decide life and death over people, Jigsaw makes it all to literal by having the company's employees as pawns and William has to make decisions on which of them survive.  Saw's morality is about as subtle as a knee to the groin.Meanwhile Mandylor pretty much sleepwalks though his role.  The only revelation of any note is a flashback which shows his juvenile rivalry with Amanda (Shawnee Smith) for the affections of their defacto Messiah, John.Is Saw VI better than the previous couple of entries?  That's like deciding if a poke in the eye with a sharp stick is better than having bamboo jammed under your fingernails.  It's all in one's own perspective.  But Saw VI is by no means good.  Given an opportunity to close the series out, the filmmakers instead left the door open for an already rumored Saw VII.  Who will the targets next film be?  Spammers?

1253132,A9HB18W9DAC1V,B00275EHFU,Toby J Martin,"[1, 1]","The Saw franchise is perhaps one of my favorite franchises, ever. In August and September, I start ignoring any TV ads for the film so nothing is ruined and I start getting my hopes up for another awesome gory installment. Halloween rolls around, and I anxiously await the huge twist at the end I'll never see coming of the film, and wonder how they'll out top the traps and gore from the year before. I'm like the Linus of the horror world, and I'm more then okay with that. All of this obviously makes me a ""unbiased"" reviewer of Saw VI, but oh well, lets do this.Saw VI picks up right at the end of the Saw V, with Detective Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) resetting the trap that he killed Agent Strahm (Scott Patterson) with at the end of Saw V. The story picks up with the investigation of ""Strahm's"" Jigsaw killings, as well as catching up with Jill Tuck (Betsy Russell), and the box that John/Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) gave her as part of the will. It also starts the next killing game, this time played by William Easton (Peter Outerbridge). William is the head of a major health insurance company who loves his job. His job of course, entails himself and his dog pack (six employees, one of which is played by Eddie Winslow [Darius McCrary]) who scan people's insurance claims, and try to dis-prove/find errors in the claims. After rejecting someone for a completely ridiculous reason, Bill hangs out at the office a little later then usual, and once the power goes out, the game begins.The story progresses like any Saw movie, with gross traps here and there, life lessons to be dished out, and lives to be ""saved"". Most of the film deals with Jill and Hoffman's involvement in 'The Game' now, especially since John's been dead for quite some time. The introduction of William into the movie ties some of the old plotholes up, and the flashbacks throughout this movie tie up a LOT of the old plotholes that have been going during the entire movie series. They did a good job with the flashbacks, and give a lot of back story to most of the cast (Jill and John, Amanda and Hoffman as Jigsaw helpers, and a lot more of John's progression into the Jigsaw killer mentality.) There's a few ""new"" characters introduced into the movie, and they fit into the story just as well as the old ones do.The biggest draw of the Saw franchise, if not for the gore/violence of the traps, is there's always a major twist or revelation at the end of the movie, and a true life lesson to be learned, that's presented by someone who's at this point known to be a murderer (John/Jigsaw). The twists in this movie, are just as good, if not better then the other movies in the series so far. They are also spread out a little more throughout the movie, and not just one huge one at the end of the film. Little things like this keep the series ""fresh"", and keep me wanting more and more sequels.Visually, the series is as gross as ever, but not in the same way some of the older films were. While the beginning of Saw VI has a really disgusting opening, most of the rest of the movies visual scares aren't necessarily gory, but more just a lot of disturbing situations. The traps are more realistic as well, but in the sense that you can almost picture yourself in them, and how they might feel to be part of them.As for the cast, they all definitely still have their hearts in the project. Tobin Bell still does an AMAZING Jigsaw in his scenes, and his words are as cryptic yet deep as ever. The whole police squad working with Hoffman while suspecting him is an interesting dynamic, and the head of the insurance company is such an ass, that you pull for him to learn something, yet when he suffers you feel a little better about it. There's a great scene with him talking to John (as a flashback obviously) where John puts him in his place, and I actually chuckled out loud when I saw it in the theater. Little touches like this I love, and I'm sure I look a little odd giggling during a Saw movie, but oh well.At first, the Saw franchise was supposed to stop at six movies (which was stated, as well as backed up by the fact that after Saw III, Tobin Bell signed up for 4-6). The way the plot comes together in this movie, would tell me that they wanted to perhaps still stop the franchise while this was being made, but decided against it at the last minute. Most every question from the Saw series is answered in the movie, but there's a few things that happen that add just enough questions to warrant a seventh movie (which has been announced, in 3-D). As a whole, this film is just as good and fresh as the first one, and I'm glad that even though this is starting to get a little crazy with the amount of sequels, I'm still enjoying every one.As an aside, I think one of my favorite parts of the Saw franchise, is that I'm old enough to enjoy the entire franchise, and to be a part of it. While I love Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm St, for example, I was too young when they all came out to be able to enjoy the runs they both made. Saw is definitely a newer generations ""horror series"".",5,See Saw Six,1279670400,"07 21, 2010",2010,5078,"['Saw', 'franchise', 'perhaps', 'one', 'favorite', 'franchises', 'ever', 'August',

It still kept me interested in Saw and I wanted to see the next one which didn't make it a waste of time. Saw VI brought my hopes up again and I must say it is probably the best of the Saw movies I've seen since Saw III. The story this time around was captivating and they really had something great going on. William Easton is an executive at a health insurance company, the choices he makes are important to people's lives whether or not he gives them insurance will have a big effect. The only problem is that he lets money make the choices for him not his heart. Hoffman meets Jigsaw's ex-wife Jill which is an important event in this movie. Right from the beginning you know you're in for something good as the opening trap is sick and freaky to me, and I wouldn't want it any other way coming from a Saw movie. Some questions are answered in this one, we get to see what was in the Box Jigsaw left for Jill in the previous film. The traps this time around don't disappoint either, in fact the carousel was very well executed and became one of my favorite traps. Just about everything in Saw VI is great, I thought the actors were better this time around, Peter Outbridge as William Easton, the main victim was great and I actually cared about him. The ending was excellent and left me begging for more.If you are not reading this as a fan then why are you? It's been six movies of Saw now and you are obviously just here posting comments like ""why do we need another Saw movie?"" and ""when will they stop this!"" which no one really want or need to read anyway. On the other hand if you ever liked a Saw movie then you should really watch this one, it's by far one the best movies in the franchise and I say this being a hardcore fan. After watching this one I totally forgave the writers for the 5th one and thought that Saw V was probably necessary to make this one so good. I got my money's worth with Saw VI and will buy it on DVD for sure. It's been six movies now; do I still want to play a game?

Jigsaw's successor is still trying to tie up some loose ends, but the script also tries to explain more about his motives behind it, and it actually makes perfect sense, but most people I would hope wouldn't develope a homicide streak over what happens here. He has every reason for feeling betrayal by the system, you can certainly empathize with him, despite his actions throughout the series. My only real complaint is they could've ended it here in my opinion, maybe the creators are money hungry now, but I haven't lost interest yet-Like I've said, if the scrpit is good, I'll keep watching them. To me, this is not a slasher series, even though the violence is very graphic, the first trilogy of this series was very impressive and original, not to mention clever, the second three were good, but the gore was a little more graphic than was needed, and I've never been a fan of excessive gore, in this series it isn't gratuitous though, to me.But I strongly suggest before seeing part 7 in theatres/or on DVD/Blue-Ray, you watch the whole series first, but this series is a lot to take in, so I'll at least watch it in spurts, others may wish to do the same.",4,"Is it over, or not?

1253137,A96JD9312DHWC,B00275EHFU,"TorridlyBoredShopper ""T(to the)B(to the)S""","[2, 2]","In Saw V, we were shown just how far the tests were willing to go. Not only were they willing to test people from this side of the grave, but they were willing to see how far people would go when listening to a dead man. This meant that John still had control of the games - or perhaps the games simply were in control - and that people had to listen. At the end we also saw that the games provided a nice scapegoat for a certain policeman's actions, blaming another for his nefarious crimes. The problem with this was that it left a certain badge untested and, as we all know, that isn't the credo that Jigsaw plays by.In Saw VI, this problem is remedied as a new game is set into motion. As in previous games, we see the insurance business being tapped and, as with other Saw movies, we see twists and turns a-plenty. In the last installment, John's wife was given a box and we weren't privy to what all that meant. In this installment, we find out what it is - the beginning of  game - and we find out about the players. These players are some people that seem to deserve the wrath of the Jigsaw - in my opinion - because they are part of the cancer eating at the world. As Jigsaw points out, ""Doctors in some Far Eastern countries are paid when patients are healthy. They pay nothing when they are sick. Here, it seems we have it all backward (paraphrased, of course).""So, welcome to Oz.The people in little Billy's playground are really getting the mean end of the stick here, and many of these people seem like they are just parts of a machine who don't note what type of cog they are. This makes the game seem mean but, at the same time, when hasn't the game seemed mean? It has the gore that we all have come to know, the twists we expect, and some things about Amanda we didn't know from her earlier days. We also see a part of the wife that we didn't see before, a darker side, showing just what the loss of her child did to her. This is pretty and ugly all at one time and, in many ways, something that is fun to latch onto. Is it fair? Not really. But neither are the games these people have played as well.I personally love the Saw movies and liked this one a lot more than many of the last sequels. This one and V fit together well, too, and they show some screw-ups that were bound to happen when someone plays with Jigsaw too long. I liked that and I liked the way that the traps were set up, teaching their lessons while not really giving the watcher the full scope of the ordeal.Its beauty in a bodybag - you have to love it.If you fell out of love with some of the other pieces of the franchise, you aren't alone. A lot of people did and, if you read along, you'll see a lot of 180s as well. So, give it a chance because you don't have to be a hardcore fan of the series to love this.

1253138,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00275EHFU,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 1]","As you know, the previous installment of the hit franchise ""Saw V"" started out with a gruesome death trap inspired by Edgar Allan Poe's ""The Pit and the Pendulum."" Now ""Saw IV"" arrives with an equally gruesome opening sequence, perhaps inspired by the famous 'pound of flesh' phrase in ""The Merchant of Venice."" Obviously the ""Saw"" series intends to remain what it set out to be, ultra-violent thrillers with lots of elaborate tortures, even though John or ""Jigsaw"" is dead.Among five sequels that were made after the surprise hit of the original ""Saw,"" the sixth entry is among the better ones. Though the basic format doesn't change a lot - captured characters are forced to join the ""games"" where they are required to do a certain thing within limited time. This time insurance executive William (Peter Outerbridge) is the principal player and his failure (or successes) means the violent death of someone, or maybe his own.The film is not for the faint-hearted, but I think you already know that. The sixth installment is directed by Kevin Greutert, who served as editor for all the five previous ""Saw""s. He keeps a good pace in unfolding the story that gets more and more complicated, with Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) and his wife Jill (Betsy Russell), as well as Mark Hoffman (Costas Mandylor), a police detective engaging in unlawful activities or Jigsaw's ""legacy.""

As it turned out, this is where the slow bleed begins.For a basic plot summary, Saw 6 sees Detective Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) continuing the work of the very much deceased Jigsaw (Tobin Bell).  This time, in keeping with real-life events, the targets of the cruel iron death traps are mortgage loaners and health care representatives, and they are both morally and physically tested by the horrifying ordeal.I have one very positive thing to saw about the film, which is that I least I could understand what was going on (something I could not say about the fifth movie).  Instead of overly relying on Jigsaw flashbacks (although there are still a few of those), this film kind of goes back to the roots of the original, where the focus is on the morality of the ""game"", not on Jigsaw's tangled personal web.  Unfortunately, that is about the only compliment I can give.The main problem with a film like this is that it has milked the source material so dry that it's more disappointing than interesting.  The original ""Saw"" completely changed the game in terms of horror flicks, but each subsequent sequel only watered things down a little bit more.  By the time this one rolled around, there are no more surprises and the shock value is gone, plain and simple.  Basically, one can only ""go to the well"" so many times before it dries up.Thus, although this franchise hasn't produced the worst sequels in horror movie history (see: Halloween), by ""Saw 6"" it is clear that the originality has dried up and the writers/producers are running on fumes.  Who knows how long the franchise will continue, as the horror genre can always bank on that one special week (up to October 31) for good business, but suffice it to say that it will only serve to make us appreciate the genius of the original even more.",2,Why Am I Still Watching?,1288569600,"11 1, 2010",2010,1986,"['utterly', 'confusing', 'fifth', 'installment', 'Saw', 'franchise', 'knew', 'Saw', 'brand', 'would', 'be', 'crossroads', 'effort', 'likely', 'determining', 'future', 'viability', 'turned', 'out', 'where', 'slow', 'bleed', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Saw', '6', 'sees', 'Detective', 'Hoffman', 'Costas', 'Mandylor', 'continuing', 'work', 'very', 'much', 'deceased', 'Jigsaw', 'Tobin', 'Bell', 'time', 'keeping', 'real-life', 'events', 'targets', 'cruel', 'iron', 'death', 'traps', 'are', 'mortgage', 'loaners', 'health', 'care', 'representatives', 'are', 'morally', 'physically', 'tested', 'horrifying', 'ordeal.I', 'have', 'one', 'very', 'positive', 'thing', 'saw', 'film', 'least', 'could', 'understand', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'something', 'could', 'not', 'say', 'fifth', 'movie', 'Instead', 'overly', 'relying', 'Jigsaw', 'flashbacks', 'are', 'still', 'few', 'film', 'kind', 'back', 'roots', 'original', 'where', 'focus', 'morality', 'game', 'not', 'Jigsaw', 'tangled', 'personal', 'web', 'Unfortunately', 'only', 'compliment', 'can', 'give.The', 'main', 'problem', 'film', 'milked', 'source', 'material', 'so', 'dry', 'more', 'disappointing', 'interesting', 'original', 'Saw', 'completely', 'changed', 'game', 'terms', 'horror', 'flicks', 'subsequent', 'sequel', 'only', 'watered', 'things', 'down', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'time', 'one', 'rolled', 'around', 'are', 'more', 'surprises', 'shock', 'value', 'gone', 'plain', 'simple', 'Basically', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'go', 'well', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'up.Thus', 'franchise', ""n't"", 'produced', 'worst', 'sequels', 'horror', 'movie', 'history', 'see', 'Halloween', 'Saw', '6', 'clear', 'originality', 'dried', 'up', 'writers/producers', 'are', 'running', 'fumes', 'Who', 'how', 'long', 'franchise', 'will', 'continue', 'horror', 'genre', 'can', 'always', 'bank', 'one', 'special', 'week', 'October', '31', 'good', 'business', 'say', 'will', 'only', 'serve', 'make', 'appreciate', 'genius', 'original', 'even', 'more']",Saw VI
