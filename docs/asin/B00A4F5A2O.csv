Who if they survived, would becomethe Officers who would lead the troops of the U.S. Army. Each episode, presented a cadet having a dilemma or crisis of one sort or another. Always to be resolved with the help of an understanding officer or upperclassmen (All done within the space of 25 min. minus commercials!)These were great moral vignettes.

Finally seeing this well acted (and well written series) again, was well worth the wait. My only disappointment was the manner in which the dvd set was shipped...in a very thin plastic bag with absolutely no protective padding, which resulted in the case bottom getting cracked and broken away. Luckily, the dvds within, were unaffected. After filing a complaint with the Amazon affiliated company, they were unable to send me a replacement case, but did thankfully, send me a s/h credit reimbursement.

This is so 1950's with a &#34;right is right&#34; philosophy of life underpinning every episode.  It was the era of the cold war and America needed West Point and young men ready to dedicate everything for the cause.  And that is exactly the kind of attitude wanted and needed at the Academy.

I don't remember ever seeing it when I was a young boy and while the acting and story lines are somewhat less dramatic than some of what we see today...I though the episodes were well done and had a great deal of moral and redeemable ideas to reflect on.  I recommend this to anyone who likes to go back in time and either remember or learn how things were back then.

During this period American television had come to terms with itself as an art form and was making giant strides in the world of entertainment.""The West Point Story"" (also known as ""West Point"") was one of those great anthology series based on true events that thrived during this period of television history.  Some others released by TMG of this type are two excellent series, ""The Lawless Years"" and ""State Trooper."" I own these DVD box sets, and have watched every episode of each series.Week after week, these shows managed to squeeze a lot of fast-paced entertainment into a mere 25 minutes. I'm constantly amazed at the writing, acting, lighting, camerawork, and everything else that went into the making of these shows. And they were all done with limited budgets and very short shooting schedules.""West Point"" aired for two seasons with a total of 40 episodes. It was on CBS during the 1956-57 season and ABC during the 1957-58 season. The legendary Gene Roddenberry, the creator of ""Star Trek,"" wrote nine of the episodes in the first season.Just a few of the young stars who appeared in various episodes were Barbara Eden, Chuck Connors, Larry Hagman, Ron Hagerhty, and Leonard Nimoy. Cadet Charles C. Thompson, portrayed by Donald May, hosted each episode of the first season.*UPDATE* There is now a ""West Point"" trailer on the Timeless Media Group website. It features scenes from the episode that guest stars Leonard Nimoy. In the excerpts shown, the picture and sound are excellent which should be a good indication of the overall quality of the collection.So get in formation, march to your computer, and order your copy of  ""West Point"" today from Amazon. If we keep supporting companies like TMG, Shout! Factory, and others, hopefully, they will keep releasing great, old series from television's ""Golden Age"" for our enjoyment.",5,"TMG does it again with another great, nearly-forgotten anthology series",1358553600,"01 19, 2013",2013,1996,"['Timeless', 'Media', 'Group', 'TMG', 'been', 'roll', 'lately', 'releasing', 'top-notch', 'television', 'series', 'different', 'genres', '1950', 'early', '1960', 'period', 'American', 'television', 'had', 'come', 'terms', 'art', 'form', 'was', 'making', 'giant', 'strides', 'world', 'entertainment', 'West', 'Point', 'Story', 'also', 'known', 'West', 'Point', 'was', 'one', 'great', 'anthology', 'series', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'thrived', 'period', 'television', 'history', 'others', 'released', 'TMG', 'type', 'are', 'two', 'excellent', 'series', 'Lawless', 'Years', 'State', 'Trooper', 'own', 'DVD', 'box', 'sets', 'have', 'watched', 'episode', 'series.Week', 'week', 'shows', 'managed', 'squeeze', 'lot', 'fast-paced', 'entertainment', 'mere', '25', 'minutes', ""'m"", 'constantly', 'amazed', 'writing', 'acting', 'lighting', 'camerawork', 'everything', 'else', 'went', 'making', 'shows', 'were', 'done', 'limited', 'budgets', 'very', 'short', 'shooting', 'schedules', 'West', 'Point', 'aired', 'two', 'seasons', 'total', '40', 'episodes', 'was', 'CBS', '1956-57', 'season', 'ABC', '1957-58', 'season', 'legendary', 'Gene', 'Roddenberry', 'creator', 'Star', 'Trek', 'wrote', 'nine', 'episodes', 'first', 'season.Just', 'few', 'young', 'stars', 'who', 'appeared', 'various', 'episodes', 'were', 'Barbara', 'Eden', 'Chuck', 'Connors', 'Larry', 'Hagman', 'Ron', 'Hagerhty', 'Leonard', 'Nimoy', 'Cadet', 'Charles', 'C.', 'Thompson', 'portrayed', 'Donald', 'May', 'hosted', 'episode', 'first', 'season', 'now', 'West', 'Point', 'trailer', 'Timeless', 'Media', 'Group', 'website', 'scenes', 'episode', 'guest', 'stars', 'Leonard', 'Nimoy', 'excerpts', 'shown', 'picture', 'sound', 'are', 'excellent', 'should', 'be', 'good', 'indication', 'overall', 'quality', 'collection.So', 'get', 'formation', 'march', 'computer', 'order', 'copy', 'West', 'Point', 'today', 'Amazon', 'keep', 'supporting', 'companies', 'TMG', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'others', 'hopefully', 'will', 'keep', 'releasing', 'great', 'old', 'series', 'television', 'Golden', 'Age', 'enjoyment']",N/A
