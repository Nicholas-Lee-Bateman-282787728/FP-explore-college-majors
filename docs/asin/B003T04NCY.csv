1361781,A2582KMXLK2P06,B003T04NCY,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Pig Hunt is a terrible film.  I was watching it with my dad tonight and since he's a hunter, he was able to pick apart all the inconsistencies with the hunting trip right down to nobody being able to hold their gun or bow correctly.  While it's raining, obviously the scope on their guns would be messed up the way they're holding them, and the ""wild"" deer -knowing they are EXTREMELY sensitive to any kind of movement whatsoever- are just standing there basically waiting for the guy to rather loudly reload a bullet from his gun- unrealistic!  That deer would have been gone by then.For a movie that goes by the name Pig Hunt, it's extremely light on the actual pigs making any kind of appearance let alone a threat.  The actual hunting (involving a group of hunters that are NOTHING alike- seriously, a group of people like this would never ever go hunting together in a million years, haha) is only half of the movie- the other half is a COMPLETE 180 that involves the use of marijuana and what can be interpreted as halluciations initially.  When one of the brothers gets shot by one of the ""friends"" after a suspicious do or die incident involving a bow and lots of arrogant mouthing off, the other gets his revenge.  This segment occurs briefly between the hunting and marijuana trips and... oh, did I forget to mention the exotic female paradise?  Yes that's right- hot half-naked women in a cabin while a vicious pig is around the area and one of the hunters gets to experience a fantasy with the ladies.  Wow is this awful.  Simply put, the hunters all eventually turn on each other and the second half of the movie is a complete waste of time and lacks memorable storytelling.The music that plays throughout the movie might just be the worst music I've honestly ever heard.  It was THAT bad.  Terrible screamer heavy metal vocals, ugh.  Also, the sound effects from the show Seinfeld can be heard several times and it's out of place to say the least.  Also, in the beginning when the character introducion gets underway, it's really bland and predictable to the point you could care less who everybody is.I do wish the amount of sarcasm and immature pot shots had been reduced.  I mean, these were basically young adults acting worse than most kids and teenagers.  The things they'd say to each other was just plain horrendous and pathetically immature and the constant need to outsmart each other at every turn *would* *not* *stop*, haha.Don't expect much in the way of enormous pigs overpowering a group of people.  It's mainly about people hunting/shooting other people.  The dangerous pigs themselves didn't even look believable to me.  Obviously they were costumes.  It's just a really bad attempt at horror that fails to deliver atmosphere, suspense, excitement or anything noteworthy.",1,pigless?  almost,1309046400,"06 26, 2011",2011,2802,"['Pig', 'Hunt', 'terrible', 'film', 'was', 'watching', 'dad', 'tonight', 'hunter', 'was', 'able', 'pick', 'apart', 'inconsistencies', 'hunting', 'trip', 'right', 'down', 'nobody', 'being', 'able', 'hold', 'gun', 'bow', 'correctly', 'raining', 'obviously', 'scope', 'guns', 'would', 'be', 'messed', 'up', 'way', ""'re"", 'holding', 'wild', 'deer', '-knowing', 'are', 'EXTREMELY', 'sensitive', 'kind', 'movement', 'whatsoever-', 'are', 'just', 'standing', 'there', 'basically', 'waiting', 'guy', 'rather', 'loudly', 'reload', 'bullet', 'gun-', 'unrealistic', 'deer', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'gone', 'then.For', 'movie', 'name', 'Pig', 'Hunt', 'extremely', 'light', 'actual', 'pigs', 'making', 'kind', 'appearance', 'let', 'alone', 'threat', 'actual', 'hunting', 'involving', 'group', 'hunters', 'are', 'NOTHING', 'alike-', 'seriously', 'group', 'people', 'would', 'never', 'ever', 'go', 'hunting', 'together', 'million', 'years', 'haha', 'only', 'half', 'movie-', 'other', 'half', 'COMPLETE', '180', 'use', 'marijuana', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'interpreted', 'halluciations', 'initially', 'When', 'one', 'brothers', 'shot', 'one', 'friends', 'suspicious', 'do', 'die', 'incident', 'involving', 'bow', 'lots', 'arrogant', 'mouthing', 'off', 'other', 'revenge', 'segment', 'briefly', 'hunting', 'marijuana', 'trips', 'oh', 'did', 'forget', 'mention', 'exotic', 'female', 'paradise', 'Yes', 'right-', 'hot', 'half-naked', 'women', 'cabin', 'vicious', 'pig', 'area', 'one', 'hunters', 'experience', 'fantasy', 'ladies', 'Wow', 'awful', 'Simply', 'put', 'hunters', 'eventually', 'turn', 'other', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'complete', 'waste', 'time', 'lacks', 'memorable', 'storytelling.The', 'music', 'movie', 'might', 'just', 'be', 'worst', 'music', ""'ve"", 'honestly', 'ever', 'heard', 'was', 'bad', 'Terrible', 'screamer', 'heavy', 'metal', 'vocals', 'ugh', 'Also', 'sound', 'effects', 'show', 'Seinfeld', 'can', 'be', 'heard', 'several', 'times', 'place', 'say', 'least', 'Also', 'beginning', 'when', 'character', 'introducion', 'underway', 'really', 'bland', 'predictable', 'point', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'who', 'everybody', 'is.I', 'do', 'wish', 'amount', 'sarcasm', 'immature', 'pot', 'shots', 'had', 'been', 'reduced', 'mean', 'were', 'basically', 'young', 'adults', 'acting', 'worse', 'most', 'kids', 'teenagers', 'things', ""'d"", 'say', 'other', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'horrendous', 'pathetically', 'immature', 'constant', 'need', 'outsmart', 'other', 'turn', '*would*', '*not*', '*stop*', 'haha.Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'way', 'enormous', 'pigs', 'overpowering', 'group', 'people', 'mainly', 'people', 'hunting/shooting', 'other', 'people', 'dangerous', 'pigs', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'look', 'believable', 'Obviously', 'were', 'costumes', 'just', 'really', 'bad', 'attempt', 'horror', 'deliver', 'atmosphere', 'suspense', 'excitement', 'anything', 'noteworthy']",N/A

Sorry, this Frightfest entry kinda boared me.Pig Hunt, directed by James Isaac(Skinwalkers), isn't a total porker.  The first hour is pretty standard stuff.  Actually it's kind of a slow-cooker as a group of friends prepare for their hog hunting party out at the family ranch.  They run into a bunch of rednecks as rumors circulate about a 3000lb psycho pig.There is some halfway decent character development and some dialogue that might induce a chuckle or two.  Finally the action gets kicked up a notch as the group runs into a marijuana patch and a pack of naked chicks.  Talk about fortuitous.  Anyway, eventually there is a murder out in the woods.  The rednecks get outraged and start to act like violent pigs.  These crazy pigs start to hunt the people that are out hunting pigs, who are also being hunted by the big wild pig.  So the pig hunting is just a violent circle and we're caught in the middle of the madness. (sigh)So this is not exactly hog heaven, but we do get an adequate serving of crossbows, machetes, weed, boobs, blood, and one fat monster boar.  Plus an appearance by Primus frontman Les Claypool makes Pig Hunt somewhat worthwhile, I suppose...",3,Pig out!?!?

1361786,A1MC6BFHWY6WC3,B003T04NCY,D. Blankenship,"[5, 5]","What to do about this movie; what to do?  Like a number of other reviewers here, I simply do not know how to classify this thing.  First let me state that I did not purchase the dvd, no, I watched this one on late night T.V., a world inhabited my shift workers and insomniacs (like myself), and their dogs. I am not going to tell you that I would have bought this film or even rented it, but it was available, I was sleepless, and I gave it a try.I will tell you that this is a rather strange and quirky movie.  There is of course the pig...and what a pig it is; a gigantic misshaped boar that rages though the woods.  More about him later.  We have a group of people - guys and a girl, who go hunting for pigs - a very mixed group.  Then we have a clan of very violent, backwoods fellows (Think `Deliverance' on steroids), a group of pot raising, cult like and for the most part, topless hippies, raising pot and now picture all of these people and animals; pigs, Deliverance guys, hippies and the hunters all trying their best to kill each other off in terribly violent ways.  And oh, by the way, there is a dog thrown in for good measure.I would go into the plot but that would be useless.  The movie was more or less a bunch of scenes that were shuffled about and I must admit that I never did figure out quite what was going on at any given time.  Now there were pros and cons to take into account here.First, this was a very, very low budget film; a direct to dvd film and this must be considered.  If you are looking for great special effects - forget it. I will be honest and tell you that when I consider what was probably spent of this film and the time they spent shooting it, I figure they did a pretty good job of making the best of what they had...which honestly, must have been very little.  I admire that.Second, despite the fact that the plot was hokie at best, the acting in this little film was really not all that bad - all things considered. The poor actors were not given all that much to work with.Third, the film, even though it started off slow, slow, slow, paid off in the end with enough violence, blood, gore and excitement to make the wait worth it.On the down side, the monster boar, who was the actually feature and center of this film, was simply a prop - a really ugly prop that was shot at quick and odd angles in an attempt to make it appear realistic.  That did not happen.  The thing looked like a phony and really ugly pig's head stuck on the end of a pole which was being thrust into camera range when ever it was semi-appropriate.The story was weak, disjointed and sort of cobbled together.But all of this was okay as far as I was concerned.  I thought the film was an absolute hoot and was quite well entertained; which when all is said and done, is the only reason to watch something like this.  I have to again be very honest with you and tell you that if I were forced to choose between watching this film or one of the films which received a lot of academy awards over the past few years, there is no doubt I would choose this one.  At least I was able to chuckle my way through the thing and my apparent latent blood lust and need to watch mindless violence was satisfied - sort of. And I kind of enjoyed the topless hippy chicks.I am giving this one four stars with the stipulation that it be watched with someone as it is one of those perfect films that allows you to make snarky comments to each other as the film unfolds.  I was stuck with the dogs who do not communicate very well (actually, they all slept through the whole thing) which took some of the fun out of this work for me.  Alas, I will never ever be able to talk my wife into watching this thing with me...sigh.Anyway, the film has violence, horrible death scenes, plenty of conflict, wild critters, bare breasted hippy girls, plenty of blood (There were actually a couple of pretty good beheadings via the hippy leader, and several folks being eaten alive by savage little porkers), and a beasty lurking...what more could you want?  I must tell you though that before the end of the movie I was soundly rooting for the pig.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks",4,GOOD FILM or BAD FILM...HMMMM...This is one you are going to have to decide for yourself.,1330128000,"02 25, 2012",2012,4162,"['What', 'do', 'movie', 'what', 'do', 'number', 'other', 'reviewers', 'here', 'simply', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'classify', 'thing', 'First', 'let', 'state', 'did', 'not', 'purchase', 'dvd', 'watched', 'one', 'late', 'night', 'T.V.', 'world', 'inhabited', 'shift', 'workers', 'insomniacs', 'dogs', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'tell', 'would', 'have', 'bought', 'film', 'even', 'rented', 'was', 'available', 'was', 'sleepless', 'gave', 'try.I', 'will', 'tell', 'rather', 'strange', 'quirky', 'movie', 'course', 'pig', 'what', 'pig', 'gigantic', 'misshaped', 'boar', 'woods', 'More', 'later', 'have', 'group', 'people', 'guys', 'girl', 'who', 'go', 'hunting', 'pigs', 'very', 'mixed', 'group', 'Then', 'have', 'clan', 'very', 'violent', 'backwoods', 'fellows', 'Think', 'Deliverance', 'steroids', 'group', 'pot', 'raising', 'cult', 'most', 'part', 'topless', 'hippies', 'raising', 'pot', 'now', 'picture', 'people', 'animals', 'pigs', 'Deliverance', 'guys', 'hippies', 'hunters', 'trying', 'best', 'kill', 'other', 'off', 'terribly', 'violent', 'ways', 'oh', 'way', 'dog', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure.I', 'would', 'go', 'plot', 'would', 'be', 'useless', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'less', 'bunch', 'scenes', 'were', 'shuffled', 'must', 'admit', 'never', 'did', 'figure', 'out', 'quite', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'given', 'time', 'Now', 'were', 'pros', 'cons', 'take', 'account', 'here.First', 'was', 'very', 'very', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'direct', 'dvd', 'film', 'must', 'be', 'considered', 'are', 'looking', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'forget', 'will', 'be', 'honest', 'tell', 'when', 'consider', 'what', 'was', 'probably', 'spent', 'film', 'time', 'spent', 'shooting', 'figure', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'making', 'best', 'what', 'had', 'honestly', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'little', 'admire', 'that.Second', 'fact', 'plot', 'was', 'hokie', 'best', 'acting', 'little', 'film', 'was', 'really', 'not', 'bad', 'things', 'considered', 'poor', 'actors', 'were', 'not', 'given', 'that', 'much', 'work', 'with.Third', 'film', 'even', 'started', 'off', 'slow', 'slow', 'slow', 'paid', 'off', 'end', 'enough', 'violence', 'blood', 'gore', 'excitement', 'make', 'wait', 'worth', 'down', 'side', 'monster', 'boar', 'who', 'was', 'actually', 'feature', 'center', 'film', 'was', 'simply', 'prop', 'really', 'ugly', 'prop', 'was', 'shot', 'quick', 'odd', 'angles', 'attempt', 'make', 'appear', 'realistic', 'did', 'not', 'happen', 'thing', 'looked', 'phony', 'really', 'ugly', 'pig', 'head', 'stuck', 'end', 'pole', 'was', 'being', 'thrust', 'camera', 'range', 'when', 'ever', 'was', 'semi-appropriate.The', 'story', 'was', 'weak', 'disjointed', 'sort', 'cobbled', 'together.But', 'was', 'okay', 'as', 'far', 'was', 'concerned', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'absolute', 'hoot', 'was', 'quite', 'well', 'entertained', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'only', 'reason', 'watch', 'something', 'have', 'again', 'be', 'very', 'honest', 'tell', 'were', 'forced', 'choose', 'watching', 'film', 'one', 'films', 'received', 'lot', 'academy', 'awards', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'doubt', 'would', 'choose', 'one', 'least', 'was', 'able', 'chuckle', 'way', 'thing', 'apparent', 'latent', 'blood', 'lust', 'need', 'watch', 'mindless', 'violence', 'was', 'satisfied', 'sort', 'kind', 'enjoyed', 'topless', 'hippy', 'chicks.I', 'am', 'giving', 'one', 'four', 'stars', 'stipulation', 'be', 'watched', 'someone', 'one', 'perfect', 'films', 'make', 'snarky', 'comments', 'other', 'film', 'unfolds', 'was', 'stuck', 'dogs', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'communicate', 'very', 'well', 'actually', 'slept', 'whole', 'thing', 'took', 'fun', 'work', 'Alas', 'will', 'never', 'ever', 'be', 'able', 'talk', 'wife', 'watching', 'thing', 'sigh.Anyway', 'film', 'violence', 'horrible', 'death', 'scenes', 'plenty', 'conflict', 'wild', 'critters', 'bare', 'breasted', 'hippy', 'girls', 'plenty', 'blood', 'were', 'actually', 'couple', 'pretty', 'good', 'beheadings', 'hippy', 'leader', 'several', 'folks', 'being', 'eaten', 'alive', 'savage', 'little', 'porkers', 'beasty', 'lurking', 'what', 'more', 'could', 'want', 'must', 'tell', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'soundly', 'rooting', 'pig.Don', 'BlankenshipThe', 'Ozarks']",N/A

I mean everything about the title and the cover would make one think that right? Well that is what it made me think and sadly it wasn't fully that while at the same time it was, confusing I know. But don't let that make you think all is bad here because it isn't. Sure this movie does not live up to ones expectations but those are mine so maybe you won't be after reading this and then seeing it. I got this because it is one of the Fangoria Fright Fest movies.The film follows a group of friends who are going on a hunting trip on the property of one of the guy's [John] uncle. Turns out John once lived out there and he is going to hunt for the large pig that he believes killed his uncle. Once arriving some ""old friends"" of his come along for the ride. So the hunt is on and the legend grows as does the tension amongst the group. Some believe in the pig while others don't, and John's new friends don't trust his old.You see the main problem with this movie is that it could have been a really good one of the three it was. Firstly this movie could have been all about the group hunting that pig and the pig taking them out one by one, kinda like a pork ""Anaconda"" or ""Jaws"". That could have been a really good flick that built the bacon drama up. Then there could have been the one where the hicks are hunting them down and with or without the ham that could have been good. Then of course there could have been the final movie with the crazy hippies killing off every one. Sadly the final version is a mix of all three.Now there is some fun to be had here as the acting is good for the most part but even still we never see the pig really until the end.

It came highly recommended to me by someone who enjoys a lot more horror than I do, and who is a bigger Les Claypool fan than I am. I explained to this person that I only like gore when it is presented with a stylish sense of exaggeration (IE: Deathproof, or Zombieland...masterpieces of modern schlock). I want to believe that this film presents that cool bad movie vibe, but really it didn't quite hit the mark for me. Maybe it's because I watched Strange Days, The Evil Dead, and Hardware before it, but this one had none of the cool scenery, nor that nice level of ridiculousness. Through most of this movie you are stuck with people who can't act, and a feeling like they are forcing the corniness. The last hour of this film almost gets it right, but the rednecks who are with the main characters through most of the movie are doing such a horrible job looking in any way at all believable, or even interesting at all for one second. It just didn't strike that balance for me. Mainly I think the camera work had nearly no style. The big pig when they finally showed it was kind of cool, and the plot twist with the hippies was a cool turn. I am on the fence about how much I can sign-off on the group of Mad-Max-style rednecks that Les Claypool was a leader of; I mean, the bike stunts were cool, but I just needed to actually have some story. Campy movies still need a bit of a winding story, and some creative camerawork or set/costume design, to really be like a cult classic. The lines are supposed to be corny, and the costumes even a bit awkward, but something somewhere in the movie has to make sense and have some style. This one just felt too deliberately corny and naively unbalanced in what aspects they took time to develop. All that time spent setting up motorcycle stunts led up to one semi-good scene where the fat kid with the cliche t-shirt gets killed. If you start there, then you will think this movie is worth watching from the start, but you will be wrong. This is filler, at best, not art.

You guessed it. No dinosaurs. Yes, the story was odd, and the performances were some what engaging.But if you wanted to actually see a monster pig, you better take a good hard look at the cover art. Because that is the best look you are going to get. The pig is little more than a conversation piece to hang the rest of the story on. When you finally get to the great obligatory battle at the end of the film, all you are going to see is a bobbing pig head puppet popping in and out of the frame. The budget was so low and the shooting schedule so short, that the producers had no hopes of building a monster prop of any kind, beyond a big ugly trophy mounted head puppet on a gimble. It snapped. It bled. It stayed in the dark to hide the overwhelming lack of craftsmanship.I do not believe in spoilers. But when the people who make a movie do this bad a job of it, then nothing anyone writes is going to spoil it any worse than it is. This review is not a spoiler. They did that already while making this no-pig-in-a-poke.Maybe I saw a different movie than the rest of these reviewers. Maybe there are several versions of ""Unrated release"" and I got the tamed down cut. The pig-less version. Maybe in the original cut the monster sprouted wings and became the most hideous and terrifying psychotic porker ever seen anywhere, and THIS was the version everybody but me saw. That is why the other reviews are so glowing. Maybe they created a whole flock of flying pigs for the heart stopping end battle, rivaling Harryhausen's best efforts. Maybe.

Tresca ""Talien""","[1, 2]","Horror films with no budget have two choices: play it straight or admit that the film is cheap and play it bloody-tongue-dangling-from-cheek. Pig Hunt wisely doesn't take itself too seriously, but it's far too wrapped up in the usual horror tropes of nudity and gore to tell a decent story about a monster pig.Let's start with the nudity.  Pig Hunt has girls by the jiggle-full, even though the attractive female lead (Tina Huang) keeps her top on.  She's oddly out of place as the tag-along girlfriend of the Guy With a Mysterious Past (Travis Aaron Wade as John Hickman).  Wade seems to be confused about the nature of the camping trip when his three friends tag along sans-ladies:  Ben (Howard Johnson Jr.), Wayne (Rajiv Shah), and Quincy (Trevor Bullock).  The aforementioned women make an appearance as servile minions of the Hippie Stranger (Bryonn Bain), a commune-running drug dealer who is fond of beheading people with his kukri.  This creates dreamy sequences meant to titillate but that come across more like an adolescent drug fantasy.In the gore department are the pigs.  Squealing footage of pigs constitutes special effects for the first two-thirds of the film.  Stupid people shoot each other, pigs gore stupid people, and then rednecks shoot pigs and stupid people.  Pig Hunt delights in zooming in on gore, but there's only so much you can do with pigs and hunters before it becomes rote.Pig Hunt uses stereotypes to make up for its plot.  The rednecks are all violent, the black guy carries an ""urban-style"" pistol to a hunt (and of course uses it to defend himself), and the Hippie is a violent maniac who keeps a giant boar as a pet.  Or as gamers might prefer, a dire boar.The hippies, the hunters, and the rednecks all clash in a final confrontation...over drugs, of all things.  Pig Hunt starts to seem more about the war on drugs than the war on pigs, and maybe that's the point.  There's an ironic nugget buried in the muck and gore, that perhaps the humans are actually the pigs.  But it's lost in all the stupidity that passes for dialogue.By the time the giant pig shows up, there's not enough lipstick in the world to justify any rating higher than one star.",1,Dire Boar!,1323302400,"12 8, 2011",2011,2189,"['Horror', 'films', 'budget', 'have', 'two', 'choices', 'play', 'straight', 'admit', 'film', 'cheap', 'play', 'bloody-tongue-dangling-from-cheek', 'Pig', 'Hunt', 'wisely', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'far', 'too', 'wrapped', 'up', 'usual', 'horror', 'tropes', 'nudity', 'gore', 'tell', 'decent', 'story', 'monster', 'pig.Let', 'start', 'nudity', 'Pig', 'Hunt', 'girls', 'jiggle-full', 'even', 'attractive', 'female', 'lead', 'Tina', 'Huang', 'top', 'oddly', 'place', 'tag-along', 'girlfriend', 'Guy', 'Mysterious', 'Past', 'Travis', 'Aaron', 'Wade', 'John', 'Hickman', 'be', 'confused', 'nature', 'camping', 'trip', 'when', 'three', 'friends', 'tag', 'sans-ladies', 'Ben', 'Howard', 'Johnson', 'Jr.', 'Wayne', 'Rajiv', 'Shah', 'Quincy', 'Trevor', 'Bullock', 'aforementioned', 'women', 'make', 'appearance', 'servile', 'minions', 'Hippie', 'Stranger', 'Bryonn', 'Bain', 'commune-running', 'drug', 'dealer', 'who', 'fond', 'beheading', 'people', 'kukri', 'dreamy', 'sequences', 'meant', 'titillate', 'come', 'more', 'adolescent', 'drug', 'gore', 'department', 'are', 'pigs', 'Squealing', 'footage', 'pigs', 'constitutes', 'special', 'effects', 'first', 'two-thirds', 'film', 'Stupid', 'people', 'shoot', 'other', 'pigs', 'gore', 'stupid', 'people', 'then', 'rednecks', 'shoot', 'pigs', 'stupid', 'people', 'Pig', 'Hunt', 'delights', 'zooming', 'gore', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'can', 'do', 'pigs', 'hunters', 'rote.Pig', 'Hunt', 'stereotypes', 'make', 'up', 'plot', 'rednecks', 'are', 'violent', 'black', 'guy', 'urban-style', 'pistol', 'hunt', 'course', 'defend', 'Hippie', 'violent', 'maniac', 'who', 'giant', 'boar', 'pet', 'gamers', 'might', 'prefer', 'dire', 'boar.The', 'hippies', 'hunters', 'rednecks', 'clash', 'final', 'confrontation', 'drugs', 'things', 'Pig', 'Hunt', 'seem', 'more', 'war', 'drugs', 'war', 'pigs', 'maybe', 'point', 'ironic', 'nugget', 'buried', 'muck', 'gore', 'perhaps', 'humans', 'are', 'actually', 'pigs', 'lost', 'stupidity', 'dialogue.By', 'time', 'giant', 'pig', 'up', 'not', 'enough', 'lipstick', 'world', 'justify', 'rating', 'higher', 'one', 'star']",N/A

However, if you are a fan of Herschell Gordon Lewis you might find something worthy of your interest.The story centers around a group of eccentric friends, armed with weapons they can hardly use, going to the backwoods for an hunting expedition. Our main character has some loosely described history about an uncle and hillbilly friends,not to mention a giant pig, but this is not explored at all. In fact, his former backwoods buddies rather unexepectedly just show up with no explanation. As do a ""hippie"" cult that has some unexplained connection to the large pig that makes a cameo near the end of the flick (or at least his head does). There are numerous storylines that are simply left dangling, and watching the movie can be an exercise in frustration. There is simply no reason for any of this to be happening. Then again, if you like a series of random events this might be right up your alley. I just cannot recommend it.",2,Not much to rave about,1285804800,"09 30, 2010",2010,1067,"['am', 'bit', 'stunned', 'high', 'marks', 'film', 'bit', 'irreverant', 'silly', 'cohesion', 'suspense', 'scares', 'However', 'are', 'fan', 'Herschell', 'Gordon', 'Lewis', 'might', 'find', 'something', 'worthy', 'interest.The', 'story', 'centers', 'group', 'eccentric', 'friends', 'armed', 'weapons', 'can', 'hardly', 'use', 'going', 'backwoods', 'hunting', 'expedition', 'main', 'character', 'loosely', 'described', 'history', 'uncle', 'hillbilly', 'friends', 'not', 'mention', 'giant', 'pig', 'not', 'explored', 'fact', 'former', 'backwoods', 'buddies', 'rather', 'unexepectedly', 'just', 'show', 'up', 'explanation', 'do', 'hippie', 'cult', 'unexplained', 'connection', 'large', 'pig', 'cameo', 'end', 'flick', 'least', 'head', 'are', 'numerous', 'storylines', 'are', 'simply', 'left', 'dangling', 'watching', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'exercise', 'frustration', 'simply', 'reason', 'be', 'happening', 'Then', 'again', 'like', 'series', 'random', 'events', 'might', 'be', 'right', 'alley', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'recommend']",N/A
1361804,A2CT2SA6KFE8GC,B003T04NCY,"Stanley Runk ""Runkdapunk""","[5, 5]","The title and cover of this DVD would have you thinking this is a Syfy Channel style creature feature about a large rampaging pig terrorizing the countryside.  It isn't, and that's good.  In fact, the pig is pretty much out of the picture and thrown in as a special event at the end.  The title, ""Pig Hunt"", is pretty much referring to the wacky adventures of a group of friends as they decide to go on a pig hunt as a manly male bondage thing.  But it's not as random a trip as we think.  John is originally from the region they are hunting in, and has his own agenda and reasons for the hunt.  Guess what they are!!!!So, as the buddies, accompanied by John's girlfriend, embark on their trip, they get more than what they bargained for when they get on the bad side of the backwoods crazies.  In fact, most of the film is about the tension and conflict with the backwoods folk.  Not terribly original, I know, but I found myself quite interested with this rather common retelling.  There's also a hippie commune in the woods run by muscular warrior type dude and his harem of topless, pot smoking chicks.  Personally the scene I could have done without is where one of the hunters ends up at the commune, and the movie seems to slow down for him to scope out all of the naked women.  This scene looks better suited to a sex comedy or something.When the pig arrives, it's a hoot.  No CGI!!!  Thank the gods of horror cinema!  It's good ol' fashioned animatronics, but unfortunately we don't see much of the of the pig other than many closeups of his mouth and head.  Some folks raised on CGI might not like this, but it looks a helluva lot better than those giant CGI snakes and alligators we see in those Syfy movies.The film was directed by Jim Issac, who blessed us with Jason X.  Thankfully this is much, much better than Jason X.  Les Claypool does the soundtrack and has a small part as one of the backwoods clan.  Blues fans should keep an eye out for harmonica great Charlie Musselwhite as a shopkeeper.  The rest of the cast is adequate, nothing too special.So in the end Pig Hunt is pretty much a cross between Deliverance and Razorback, a bit more on the Deliverance side.  I liked it for what it was and I'd gladly watch it again.",4,What A Boar.,1307232000,"06 5, 2011",2011,2243,"['title', 'cover', 'DVD', 'would', 'have', 'thinking', 'Syfy', 'Channel', 'style', 'creature', 'feature', 'large', 'rampaging', 'pig', 'terrorizing', 'countryside', ""n't"", 'good', 'fact', 'pig', 'pretty', 'much', 'picture', 'thrown', 'special', 'event', 'end', 'title', 'Pig', 'Hunt', 'pretty', 'much', 'referring', 'wacky', 'adventures', 'group', 'friends', 'decide', 'go', 'pig', 'hunt', 'manly', 'male', 'bondage', 'thing', 'not', 'random', 'trip', 'think', 'John', 'originally', 'region', 'are', 'hunting', 'own', 'agenda', 'reasons', 'hunt', 'Guess', 'what', 'are', 'So', 'buddies', 'accompanied', 'John', 'girlfriend', 'embark', 'trip', 'get', 'more', 'what', 'bargained', 'when', 'get', 'bad', 'side', 'backwoods', 'crazies', 'fact', 'most', 'film', 'tension', 'conflict', 'backwoods', 'folk', 'Not', 'terribly', 'original', 'know', 'found', 'quite', 'interested', 'rather', 'common', 'retelling', 'also', 'hippie', 'commune', 'woods', 'run', 'muscular', 'warrior', 'type', 'dude', 'harem', 'topless', 'pot', 'smoking', 'chicks', 'Personally', 'scene', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'where', 'one', 'hunters', 'up', 'commune', 'movie', 'slow', 'down', 'scope', 'out', 'naked', 'women', 'scene', 'better', 'suited', 'sex', 'comedy', 'something.When', 'pig', 'hoot', 'CGI', 'Thank', 'gods', 'horror', 'cinema', 'good', 'ol', 'fashioned', 'animatronics', 'unfortunately', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'pig', 'other', 'many', 'closeups', 'mouth', 'head', 'folks', 'raised', 'CGI', 'might', 'not', 'like', 'helluva', 'lot', 'better', 'giant', 'CGI', 'snakes', 'alligators', 'see', 'Syfy', 'movies.The', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'Jim', 'Issac', 'who', 'blessed', 'Jason', 'X.', 'Thankfully', 'much', 'much', 'better', 'Jason', 'X.', 'Les', 'Claypool', 'soundtrack', 'small', 'part', 'one', 'backwoods', 'clan', 'Blues', 'fans', 'should', 'keep', 'eye', 'out', 'harmonica', 'great', 'Charlie', 'Musselwhite', 'shopkeeper', 'rest', 'cast', 'adequate', 'nothing', 'too', 'special.So', 'end', 'Pig', 'Hunt', 'pretty', 'much', 'cross', 'Deliverance', 'Razorback', 'bit', 'more', 'Deliverance', 'side', 'liked', 'what', 'was', ""'d"", 'gladly', 'watch', 'again']",N/A
