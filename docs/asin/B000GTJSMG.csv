However, this video collection is surprisingly amateurish and it is missing many of the great videos that R.E.M. made during this period.  I think it is time for R.E.M. and I.R.S. to mend fences, remaster the work off of the first five and a half R.E.M. albums, and issue a complete and professional compilation of the videos from this period.",2,Surprisingly Amateurish,1250380800,"08 16, 2009",2009,442,"['love', 'R.E.M', 'particularly', 'love', 'R.E.M', 'songs', 'were', 'recorded', 'I.R.S', 'label', 'However', 'video', 'collection', 'surprisingly', 'amateurish', 'missing', 'many', 'great', 'videos', 'R.E.M', 'made', 'period', 'think', 'time', 'R.E.M', 'I.R.S', 'mend', 'fences', 'remaster', 'work', 'first', 'five', 'half', 'R.E.M', 'albums', 'issue', 'complete', 'professional', 'compilation', 'videos', 'period']",N/A

I'd never seen the ""regular"" version on this DVD before.  With the performance footage, fast-paced editing & video effects, I'm guessing this is the MTV edit, & the version on the hidden track & _Succumbs_ is the band's version.  The ""MTV version"" doesn't look so good for some reason -- I don't know if it's because they ended up lifting it from some old broadcast tape or what, but the hidden track looks better, and, I think, makes more sense -- well, as much as it can, anyway.Speaking of picture quality, I was lucky enough to find a used LaserDisc of _Succumbs_ for not too long ago, thinking it'd probably never make it to DVD.  (One thing about ""obsolete"" formats -- you can often find used media & players for cheap!)  I must say, I'm a little disappointed with the picture quality of some of the videos on this DVD that are also on _Succumbs_, as I think they look better on the LD.  Don't get me wrong -- the picture quality of the DVD isn't bad, I just think it could've been better.Now, it would've been great if they could've included (as an extra, or whatever) the old intro to _Succumbs_, in which Peter Buck & Jefferson Holt welcome ""citizens of the future"" to a ""representative sample of an outmoded art form: the video.""  I think that's even funnier now, since the video almost IS an outmoded art form now, as they don't get played very often anymore -- it seems like the ""M"" in ""MTV"" stands more for ""mediocrity"" these days -- it apparently doesn't stand for ""music"" anymore!  Perhaps they included that as an Easter egg, & I just haven't discovered it yet?  If you discover it, please let the rest of us know!",4,I'm still keeping my _Succumbs_ LD,1158624000,"09 19, 2006",2006,1947,"['First', 'thanks', 'reviewer', 'who', 'explained', 'how', 'find', 'hidden', 'tracks', 'Radio', 'Free', 'Europe', 'Driver', '8', 'When', 'played', 'DVD', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'quite', 'surprised', 'see', 'different', 'version', 'Radio', 'Free', 'Europe', 'old', '_Sucumbs_', 'compilation', 'hidden', 'version', '_Succumbs_', 'version', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'regular', 'version', 'DVD', 'performance', 'footage', 'fast-paced', 'editing', 'video', 'effects', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'MTV', 'edit', 'version', 'hidden', 'track', '_Succumbs_', 'band', 'version', 'MTV', 'version', ""n't"", 'look', 'so', 'good', 'reason', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'ended', 'up', 'lifting', 'old', 'broadcast', 'tape', 'what', 'hidden', 'track', 'better', 'think', 'more', 'sense', 'well', 'as', 'much', 'can', 'anyway.Speaking', 'picture', 'quality', 'was', 'lucky', 'enough', 'find', 'used', 'LaserDisc', '_Succumbs_', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'ago', 'thinking', ""'d"", 'probably', 'never', 'make', 'DVD', 'One', 'thing', 'obsolete', 'formats', 'can', 'often', 'find', 'used', 'media', 'players', 'cheap', 'must', 'say', ""'m"", 'little', 'disappointed', 'picture', 'quality', 'videos', 'DVD', 'are', 'also', '_Succumbs_', 'think', 'look', 'better', 'LD', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'picture', 'quality', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'bad', 'just', 'think', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better.Now', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'great', 'could', ""'ve"", 'included', 'extra', 'old', 'intro', '_Succumbs_', 'Peter', 'Buck', 'Jefferson', 'Holt', 'welcome', 'citizens', 'future', 'representative', 'sample', 'outmoded', 'art', 'form', 'video', 'think', 'even', 'funnier', 'now', 'video', 'almost', 'IS', 'outmoded', 'art', 'form', 'now', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'played', 'very', 'often', 'anymore', 'M', 'MTV', 'more', 'mediocrity', 'days', 'apparently', ""n't"", 'stand', 'music', 'anymore', 'Perhaps', 'included', 'Easter', 'egg', 'just', 'have', ""n't"", 'discovered', 'yet', 'discover', 'please', 'let', 'rest', 'know']",N/A

I'm sure some of it is previously unreleased, but available by some means through the vast rock and roll underground.  This was a time when Michael Stipe had hair and they had a drummer and all was right with the world.  There are some funny moments, especially the candid interviews.  The most interesting moments to me were the extended portions at Howard Finster's place. Some of the TV performances, though, are surprisingly weak and it's obvious that early on Stipe was not comfortable with being a front man.  However, the energy of the group and the creativity there, overall, really shines through in this collection.  It's obvious that this is a group ready to do anything to conquer the world, that really hung together as a unit and were dedicated to their craft.",5,Art School Videos For Country Boys,1167955200,"01 5, 2007",2007,911,"['already', 'R.E.M', 'nice', 'collection', 'have', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'culled', 'together', 'material', 'somewhere', 'else', ""'m"", 'sure', 'previously', 'unreleased', 'available', 'means', 'vast', 'rock', 'roll', 'underground', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'Michael', 'Stipe', 'had', 'hair', 'had', 'drummer', 'was', 'right', 'world', 'are', 'funny', 'moments', 'especially', 'candid', 'interviews', 'most', 'interesting', 'moments', 'were', 'extended', 'portions', 'Howard', 'Finster', 'place', 'TV', 'performances', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'weak', 'obvious', 'early', 'Stipe', 'was', 'not', 'comfortable', 'being', 'front', 'man', 'However', 'energy', 'group', 'creativity', 'there', 'overall', 'really', 'collection', 'obvious', 'group', 'ready', 'do', 'anything', 'conquer', 'world', 'really', 'together', 'unit', 'were', 'dedicated', 'craft']",N/A

1006869,A24YVJWNLBU314,B000GTJSMG,Trevor Seigler,"[1, 2]","It's hard to believe that R.E.M. have been around twenty-six years and counting, and even harder to believe that they continue to make music today (though fans may question the quality of that recent work compared to their earlier classics, they still keep true to the creative muse).This DVD video collection highlights the band's years with IRS Records, a maverick label that benefited from attachments to A&M; and RCA but nevertheless helped birth the alternative scene in America in the otherwise stagnant Reagan Era. There are some gems here among the pack: ""Wolves, Lower"" is a very interesting slice of ""Chronic Town""-era REM, the live performances of ""Radio Free Europe"" and ""Talk About the Passion"" are great, and the ""Cutting Edge"" broadcasts from the early Eighties are nice looks at the band before they got massive, got signed to a major label, and lost their drummer along the way (thankfully due to exhaustion and not the rock-star cliche of an early death).Through it all, R.E.M. manage to defy catagorization; despite the odd, vaguely New Wave-ish video for ""Wolves"" (which reminded me a little of Joy Division or the Cure), they can turn right around and do a silly take on ""Can't Get There From Here"" or bring it back to seriousness with ""Fall on Me"" or ""Talk About the Passion"". And they can have a good time onstage, as the live performances attest.All in all, if you want to see R.E.M. in all their indie glory (before the acclaim of ""Out of Time"", the bombast of ""Monster"", and the techno noodlings of recent albums), this is the DVD for you. I would have liked a documentary of the band's IRS days to be on there, whether it previously exists or would have to be brought about by new interviews.
