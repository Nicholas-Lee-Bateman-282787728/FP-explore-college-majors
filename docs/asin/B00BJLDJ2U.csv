I fell in love with Airbuddies, Snowbuddies, Spacebuddies and my favorite, Santabuddies.I enjoyed Spookybuddies but I felt they could have done a bit more. Treasurebuddies was a complete disappointment, so I expected better of this.At first I was excited to see it, but before the DVD was released, I found out a lady's horse was injured during filming this movie. The lady received no apology from Disney or Robert Vince. The horse's injury caused him to be lame for weeks to come, and Disney and Robert Vince even tried lying saying the horse was always lame. This alone makes me want to give this movie 1 star.I did not buy this movie but feel if an animal was injured in it, then they don't deserve the 20 dollars from me to purchase it. It does make me wonder though...if they say the on end credits &#34;No animals were harmed in the making of this film&#34; because animals were harmed.Making Superbuddies sacrificed an innocent ranch horse...anyone who buys it doesn't realize they just paid for a movie where an animal was injured.

Ten minutes into this I was ready to tear my hair out; after eighty I was considering canceling my Netflix Streaming subscription just so this monstrosity would be out of my Recently Viewed queue and the Bean would forget about its existence.

I know I'm overly practical but it's hard for me to get into something so unrealistic. However, with Disney's name on Super Buddies, I knew if anyone could do it well, it would be Disney.My kids weren't really interested in watching and after seeing it, I think it's a little old for my four and five year olds. Part of it is just that it's not a cartoon but since the human characters are young teens, it would probably appeal more to a tween/teen audience. Paige did come in and out when the aliens were on screen as they were more up her alley!I'm always amazed when watching Disney movies how skilled they are at matching voices with animals/characters. The accents and expressions fit to a `T' so you really believe these talking animals as they have evolved into something so realistic. I think in these types of movies it's really a make or break deal to get the voices right.Super Buddies was cute and entertaining and I actually enjoyed watching it.
