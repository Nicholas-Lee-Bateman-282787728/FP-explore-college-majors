296737,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,6302120551,Byron Kolln,"[1, 1]","If you can forgive the sad fact that the movie bears very little in common with the accurate life story of Cole Porter, then NIGHT AND DAY (1946) can be enjoyed for it's treasure trove of musical performances; but as a genuine screen biography of the composer, it falls decidedly flat.Cary Grant stars as the tunesmith who gave us such standards as ""I Get a Kick Out of You"", ""Anything Goes"", ""Begin the Beguine"" and ""Let's Do It"", in this most loose recreation of Cole Porter's early career, leading up to the horse-riding accident which left him crippled.  Porter's devoted wife Linda is played with charm and poise by Alexis Smith, who comes off quite well.In reality, Porter was bisexual and his marriage to Linda (a divorce&eacute; who had endured abuse in her previous relationship) was a mutually supportive ""arrangement"", although they did love each other very much.  This of course couldn't be depicted on-screen in 1946 because of the strict censorship laws.Adding flash to the musical portions are Ginny Simms (who somehow manages to make us forget the non-presence of Ethel Merman in the ""Anything Goes"" sequences); and Mary Martin recreating her star-making turn (""My Heart Belongs to Daddy"") from ""Leave It to Me"".  Jane Wyman is a sparky chorus girl, and Monty Woolley plays himself.  Eve Arden has a small but enjoyable bit as a French music-hall singer.  Unlike MGM, Warners didn't have the largest pool of musical talents from which to pick and choose, but I think they did a good job with the casting in NIGHT AND DAY.  In hindsight, it might have been more appropriate to have been filmed in B&W;, but the Technicolor photography definitely enhances the charm of the musical numbers.Warner's DVD features a nice print (if a trifle washed-out in places); along with some choice shorts from the era (""Musical Movieland"", ""Desi Arnaz & His Orchestra""), and the Looney Tunes cartoon ""The Big Snooze"".  Also available as part ofThe Cary Grant Signature Collection (Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House / Destination Tokyo / The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer / My Favorite Wife / Night and Day).",4,Cary Grant in a *very* loose Porter biopic,1261872000,"12 27, 2009",2009,2108,"['can', 'forgive', 'sad', 'fact', 'movie', 'very', 'little', 'common', 'accurate', 'life', 'story', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'then', 'NIGHT', 'AND', 'DAY', '1946', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'treasure', 'trove', 'musical', 'performances', 'genuine', 'screen', 'biography', 'composer', 'decidedly', 'flat.Cary', 'Grant', 'stars', 'tunesmith', 'who', 'gave', 'such', 'standards', 'Get', 'Kick', 'Out', 'Anything', 'Goes', 'Begin', 'Beguine', 'Let', 'Do', 'most', 'loose', 'recreation', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'early', 'career', 'leading', 'up', 'horse-riding', 'accident', 'left', 'crippled', 'Porter', 'devoted', 'wife', 'Linda', 'played', 'charm', 'poise', 'Alexis', 'Smith', 'who', 'quite', 'well.In', 'reality', 'Porter', 'was', 'bisexual', 'marriage', 'Linda', 'divorce', 'eacute', 'who', 'had', 'endured', 'abuse', 'previous', 'relationship', 'was', 'mutually', 'supportive', 'arrangement', 'did', 'love', 'other', 'very', 'much', 'course', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'depicted', 'on-screen', '1946', 'strict', 'censorship', 'laws.Adding', 'flash', 'musical', 'portions', 'are', 'Ginny', 'Simms', 'who', 'somehow', 'make', 'forget', 'non-presence', 'Ethel', 'Merman', 'Anything', 'Goes', 'sequences', 'Mary', 'Martin', 'recreating', 'star-making', 'turn', 'Heart', 'Belongs', 'Daddy', 'Leave', 'Me', 'Jane', 'Wyman', 'sparky', 'chorus', 'girl', 'Monty', 'Woolley', 'Eve', 'Arden', 'small', 'enjoyable', 'bit', 'French', 'music-hall', 'singer', 'MGM', 'Warners', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'largest', 'pool', 'musical', 'talents', 'pick', 'choose', 'think', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'casting', 'NIGHT', 'AND', 'DAY', 'hindsight', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'appropriate', 'have', 'been', 'filmed', 'B', 'W', 'Technicolor', 'photography', 'definitely', 'charm', 'musical', 'numbers.Warner', 'DVD', 'nice', 'print', 'trifle', 'washed-out', 'places', 'choice', 'shorts', 'era', 'Musical', 'Movieland', 'Desi', 'Arnaz', 'Orchestra', 'Looney', 'Tunes', 'cartoon', 'Big', 'Snooze', 'Also', 'available', 'part', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Signature', 'Collection', 'Mr.', 'Blandings', 'Builds', 'Dream', 'House', '/', 'Destination', 'Tokyo', '/', 'Bachelor', 'Bobby-Soxer', '/', 'My', 'Favorite', 'Wife', '/', 'Night', 'Day']",Night and Day VHS
296738,A3K8POFWCQI2GS,6302120551,Char,"[2, 3]","It goes almost without saying that if you don't really like the songs of Cole Porter, you won't like this movie about his life, which includes renditions of  MANY well-known SONGS that earned him his reputation as a lyric genius.  I'm not sure whether I really like Porter's songs (and won't take time here to analyze why I might not), but every time I get bored or irritated with one of them and turn it off halfway through, I seem to like it a little better the next time I hear it!  Some Porter songs I like/dislike better/worse than others.  For me, a lot depends on how they're done and who sings them.  I really do like the powerful version of ""Night and Day"" that Ronan Tynan sings in his album ""The Impossible Dream.""If you happen not to like Porter's songs very much, there are still things about this movie that are really remarkable and dazzling and worth seeing.  The lush use of COLOR is just truly marvelous.  There is dramatically beautiful color in the scenery, as with the outstanding snow and sled scenes of the Christmas season set at the home of Cole Porter's parents early in the movie.  There's also marvelous color in the costumes and clothing which are stunning examples of typical 1940s  Hollywood GLAMOUR in its hey-day when this movie was made in 1946.  The rapidly changing melange of beautiful COSTUMES AND FASHIONS here, as the film progresses, is 100% noticeably gorgeous.  In my estimation, the costume and fashion designs are at a level of highly realized art.  For anyone whose taste runs to exquisite costumery and clothing, this movie would be quite enjoyable.  If you are too bored by the Porter songs and dances, and a plot which may seem (as it does to me) to be presented in a shallow and non-compelling way, why not turn down the sound and fast-forward the speed, which is what I did.  That way you can get the visual beauty, which is considerable, without wasting a lot of time on the other elements that may strike you as too trivial.  Even though after I got about halfway through and decided to watch most of the movie speeded up, I slowed it to normal speed a lot of times in order to briefly enjoy beautiful ladies' dresses or bits of certain songs.This movie is also enjoyable because of the presence of Alexis Smith, a movie star you don't see very often.  There's a sophisticated grace in her portrayal of Porter's wife Linda that reminds me of Grace Kelley.Cary Grant, who looks nothing at all like Cole Porter, was entirely wrong, I thought, in the part of Cole, and the disparity in appearance and personality was one large factor in causing me to consider the movie an unsuccessful biography of Porter.  The personality of Cary Grant is so distinctive that no matter what he does to change it, he always seems to be just that charismatic character known as ""Cary Grant"" and no one else.  It was clear that he was attempting to portray painful, anguished, unhappy emotions in Porter, but, somehow, I could not manage to meld together his acting/face/figure with what I knew of Porter's appearance/personality.  Also, there was an overall clash between the movie's romantic love-story elan and the anguished, deficient, sexual elements suggested by the movie but never explained.  The troubled elements of Porter's personality were very EVIDENT in the story but came across as just an inexplicable surface mystery.  His love for Linda, as presented, seemed dispassionate, not really believable, actually maybe non-existent, so, as love story, the movie was not satisfying.  As love story, it was frustrating, just as Porter's and Linda's real life marriage probably was.  Yet, in the movie, no reason for Porter's seeming lack of real ""chemistry"" for Linda is ever given.If you want to see what Cole Porter really looked like, he played himself in a brief scene at the beginning of a filmed musical he wrote called ""Kiss Me, Kate,"" a story about contemporary theater people that contains some plot elements based on ""The Taming of the Shrew"" by Shakespeare.",3,"A+ anyway for fabulous COLOR, worth seeing for that",1311465600,"07 24, 2011",2011,4009,"['almost', 'saying', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'songs', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'life', 'renditions', 'MANY', 'well-known', 'SONGS', 'earned', 'reputation', 'lyric', 'genius', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'really', 'Porter', 'songs', 'wo', ""n't"", 'take', 'time', 'here', 'analyze', 'why', 'might', 'not', 'time', 'get', 'bored', 'irritated', 'one', 'turn', 'off', 'halfway', 'seem', 'like', 'little', 'better', 'next', 'time', 'hear', 'Porter', 'songs', 'like/dislike', 'better/worse', 'others', 'lot', 'how', ""'re"", 'done', 'who', 'sings', 'really', 'do', 'powerful', 'version', 'Night', 'Day', 'Ronan', 'Tynan', 'sings', 'album', 'Impossible', 'Dream', 'happen', 'not', 'like', 'Porter', 'songs', 'very', 'much', 'are', 'still', 'things', 'movie', 'are', 'really', 'remarkable', 'dazzling', 'worth', 'seeing', 'lush', 'use', 'COLOR', 'just', 'truly', 'marvelous', 'dramatically', 'beautiful', 'color', 'scenery', 'outstanding', 'snow', 'sled', 'scenes', 'Christmas', 'season', 'set', 'home', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'parents', 'early', 'movie', 'also', 'marvelous', 'color', 'costumes', 'clothing', 'are', 'stunning', 'examples', 'typical', '1940s', 'Hollywood', 'GLAMOUR', 'hey-day', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'made', '1946', 'rapidly', 'changing', 'melange', 'beautiful', 'COSTUMES', 'AND', 'FASHIONS', 'here', 'film', 'progresses', '100', '%', 'noticeably', 'gorgeous', 'estimation', 'costume', 'fashion', 'designs', 'are', 'level', 'highly', 'realized', 'art', 'anyone', 'taste', 'exquisite', 'costumery', 'clothing', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'are', 'too', 'bored', 'Porter', 'songs', 'dances', 'plot', 'may', 'seem', 'be', 'presented', 'shallow', 'non-compelling', 'way', 'why', 'not', 'turn', 'down', 'sound', 'fast-forward', 'speed', 'what', 'did', 'way', 'can', 'get', 'visual', 'beauty', 'considerable', 'wasting', 'lot', 'time', 'other', 'elements', 'may', 'strike', 'too', 'trivial', 'Even', 'got', 'about', 'halfway', 'decided', 'watch', 'most', 'movie', 'speeded', 'up', 'slowed', 'normal', 'speed', 'lot', 'times', 'order', 'briefly', 'enjoy', 'beautiful', 'ladies', 'dresses', 'bits', 'certain', 'songs.This', 'movie', 'also', 'enjoyable', 'presence', 'Alexis', 'Smith', 'movie', 'star', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'very', 'often', 'sophisticated', 'grace', 'portrayal', 'Porter', 'wife', 'Linda', 'Grace', 'Kelley.Cary', 'Grant', 'who', 'nothing', 'like', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'was', 'entirely', 'wrong', 'thought', 'part', 'Cole', 'disparity', 'appearance', 'personality', 'was', 'one', 'large', 'factor', 'causing', 'consider', 'movie', 'unsuccessful', 'biography', 'Porter', 'personality', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'so', 'distinctive', 'matter', 'what', 'change', 'always', 'be', 'just', 'charismatic', 'character', 'known', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'one', 'else', 'was', 'clear', 'was', 'attempting', 'portray', 'painful', 'anguished', 'unhappy', 'emotions', 'Porter', 'somehow', 'could', 'not', 'manage', 'meld', 'together', 'acting/face/figure', 'what', 'knew', 'Porter', 'appearance/personality', 'Also', 'was', 'overall', 'clash', 'movie', 'romantic', 'love-story', 'elan', 'anguished', 'deficient', 'sexual', 'elements', 'suggested', 'movie', 'never', 'explained', 'troubled', 'elements', 'Porter', 'personality', 'were', 'very', 'EVIDENT', 'story', 'came', 'just', 'inexplicable', 'surface', 'mystery', 'love', 'Linda', 'presented', 'seemed', 'dispassionate', 'not', 'really', 'believable', 'actually', 'maybe', 'non-existent', 'so', 'love', 'story', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'satisfying', 'love', 'story', 'was', 'frustrating', 'just', 'Porter', 'Linda', 'real', 'life', 'marriage', 'probably', 'was', 'movie', 'reason', 'Porter', 'seeming', 'lack', 'real', 'chemistry', 'Linda', 'ever', 'given.If', 'want', 'see', 'what', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'really', 'looked', 'played', 'brief', 'scene', 'beginning', 'filmed', 'musical', 'wrote', 'called', 'Kiss', 'Me', 'Kate', 'story', 'contemporary', 'theater', 'people', 'plot', 'elements', 'based', 'Taming', 'Shrew', 'Shakespeare']",Night and Day VHS
296739,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,6302120551,C. O. DeRiemer,"[5, 6]","Night and Day is probably the worst of the reverential ""biographies"" of America's great theater composers which Hollywood cranked out in the Forties. Rodgers & Hart, George Gershwin, Jerome Kern, Sigmund Romberg, the list goes on, were all smoothed out, glossed over, given awful dialogue and had to see their songs so over-produced at times it must have seemed that they were hearing the heavenly choir.Night and Day gives us a number of Cole Porter songs polished and massaged with the lush sound stage treatment. The movie also gives the songs pretentious orchestrations so foreign to Porter's style, plus bowdlerized and rewritten lyrics to insure little of Porter's naughtiness would survive to possibly offend middle America.Most surrealistically, we have Cary Grant as Cole Porter...and that is the kind of casting that makes the Hollywood studio system so wonderful to read about. In addition to being one of the great theater composers, Porter was short, enthusiastically gay, a bit pop-eyed and a terrible social snob. On the other hand, he was supposed to have had a great sense of humor, and reportedly was highly amused when Cary Grant was chosen to portray him. (Another odd bit of Hollywood casting was choosing Mickey Rooney to play Lorenz Hart in Words and Music.)One or two good biographies have been written about Porter. As a film biography, though, Night and Day is largely a work of hack Hollywood fiction. But don't we at least get a bunch of his songs? Sadly, the songs have been so over-produced, treated so respectfully and have been so sanitized, that watching the numbers often is just downright irritating.Porter, such a social snob and living the kind of high-maintenance life some might consider simply frivolous, is worth knowing because of his songs...and his songs are best enjoyed when they are performed with impudence and style. It's smart to remember that when he wrote...I love youHums the April breeze.I love youEcho the hills.I love youThe golden dawn agreesAs once more she seesDaffodils.It's spring againAnd birds on the wing againStart to sing againThe old melody.I love you,That's the song of songsAnd it all belongsTo you and me....he wrote it to win a bet that he couldn't write a hit love song using mundane images. Porter won the bet and thoroughly enjoyed seeing what he consider a mediocre string of cliches become widely popular.  If you enjoy detective work as well as Cole Porter songs, track down the CD's produced by Ben Bagley, the Cole Porter Revisited series of albums. I think Porter might have enjoyed them. And there is also this essential book,The Complete Lyrics of Cole Porter",2,It's a good thing Cole Porter had a sense of humor,1187827200,"08 23, 2007",2007,2641,"['Night', 'Day', 'probably', 'worst', 'reverential', 'biographies', 'America', 'great', 'theater', 'composers', 'Hollywood', 'cranked', 'out', 'Forties', 'Rodgers', 'Hart', 'George', 'Gershwin', 'Jerome', 'Kern', 'Sigmund', 'Romberg', 'list', 'were', 'smoothed', 'out', 'glossed', 'given', 'awful', 'dialogue', 'had', 'see', 'songs', 'so', 'over-produced', 'times', 'must', 'have', 'seemed', 'were', 'hearing', 'heavenly', 'choir.Night', 'Day', 'number', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'songs', 'polished', 'massaged', 'lush', 'sound', 'stage', 'treatment', 'movie', 'also', 'songs', 'pretentious', 'orchestrations', 'so', 'foreign', 'Porter', 'style', 'bowdlerized', 'rewritten', 'lyrics', 'insure', 'little', 'Porter', 'naughtiness', 'would', 'survive', 'possibly', 'offend', 'middle', 'America.Most', 'surrealistically', 'have', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'kind', 'casting', 'Hollywood', 'studio', 'system', 'so', 'wonderful', 'read', 'about', 'addition', 'being', 'one', 'great', 'theater', 'composers', 'Porter', 'was', 'short', 'enthusiastically', 'gay', 'bit', 'pop-eyed', 'terrible', 'social', 'snob', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'supposed', 'have', 'had', 'great', 'sense', 'humor', 'reportedly', 'was', 'highly', 'amused', 'when', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'was', 'chosen', 'portray', 'odd', 'bit', 'Hollywood', 'casting', 'was', 'choosing', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'play', 'Lorenz', 'Hart', 'Words', 'Music', 'One', 'two', 'good', 'biographies', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'Porter', 'film', 'biography', 'though', 'Night', 'Day', 'largely', 'work', 'hack', 'Hollywood', 'fiction', 'do', ""n't"", 'least', 'get', 'bunch', 'songs', 'Sadly', 'songs', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'over-produced', 'treated', 'so', 'respectfully', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'sanitized', 'watching', 'numbers', 'often', 'just', 'downright', 'irritating.Porter', 'social', 'snob', 'living', 'kind', 'high-maintenance', 'life', 'might', 'consider', 'simply', 'frivolous', 'worth', 'knowing', 'songs', 'songs', 'are', 'best', 'enjoyed', 'when', 'are', 'performed', 'impudence', 'style', 'smart', 'remember', 'when', 'wrote', 'love', 'April', 'breeze.I', 'love', 'youEcho', 'hills.I', 'love', 'youThe', 'golden', 'dawn', 'agreesAs', 'once', 'more', 'seesDaffodils.It', 'spring', 'againAnd', 'birds', 'wing', 'againStart', 'sing', 'againThe', 'old', 'melody.I', 'love', 'song', 'songsAnd', 'belongsTo', 'wrote', 'win', 'bet', 'could', ""n't"", 'write', 'hit', 'love', 'song', 'using', 'mundane', 'images', 'Porter', 'won', 'bet', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'what', 'consider', 'mediocre', 'string', 'cliches', 'become', 'widely', 'popular', 'enjoy', 'detective', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'songs', 'track', 'down', 'CD', 'produced', 'Ben', 'Bagley', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'Revisited', 'series', 'albums', 'think', 'Porter', 'might', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'also', 'essential', 'book', 'Complete', 'Lyrics', 'Cole', 'Porter']",Night and Day VHS

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[4, 6]","Very little of the actual Cole Porter exists in ""Night and Day,"" a scrubbed-down version of the legendary Broadway songwriter's life. While Cary Grant is wonderfully charismatic, the movie itself is both fluffy and stretched out, with the holes patched by colourful musical numbers.We're introduced to Cole (Grant) as he finishes one year at Yale, but disappoints his grandfather by saying that he's quitting to be a songwriter. He and his professor Monty Woolley (played by self) manage to scrounge up the money for a brilliant musical -- only to have World War I break out on opening night, thus destroying the show.But after being injured, Cole regains his musical skills, with the help of his soon-to-be-wife Linda (Alexis Smith). Soon he's world-famous for his sparkling songs and brilliant dancing... but fame has a price, and Linda is growing tired of being second-fiddle to Cole's career. Things get even worse when he has a crippling fall from a horse.Given that this movie was made in 1946, Porter gets the deluxe whitewashing -- inner demons, depression, chronic pain, homosexuality and a platonic marriage are all watered down into a typical Hollywood romance. Only the final close-up of Grant -- looking stiff and slightly ominous -- may hint at the lack of a storybook ending.Unfortunately, the movie before it is rather corny, with melodramatic confrontations and the hokey handling of real-life tragedies (Porter's near-crippling). It's just fluff. And being turned into fluff, there's too little material included to spread around, so the filmmakers patched it with kitschy versions of Porter's songs, all in eyepoppingly garish colours. Okay, I loved that mad tap-dancing number, but that's about it.Grant plays a purely fantasy Porter, but he does so with suave charm and style, as well as good chemistry with the elegant Alexis Smith.

Taylor ""GFT""","[47, 49]","One of Broadway's most brilliant songwriters, Cole Porter (1891-1964) worked hard to present an unflappable image to the world--but in truth he was a tremendously complex man, a homosexual who lived with wife Linda Lee Thomas in a marriage of convenience, subject fits of depression, and suffering horrific pain in the wake of a horseback riding accident which left him crippled at the peak of his career.  Add to this the fact that his lyrics were often censored for film, radio, and records and it seems very odd that 1940s Hollywood would attempt a biography.What they did, of course, was fictionalize it to the max, reducing the story of his life to a mix of backstage musical and domestic drama--and transforming the tiny and waspish Porter and his icy bride Linda into handsome Cary Grant and lovely Alexis Smith.  The result is pure nonsense, of course, but when you tack in a host of Porter classics--fantasy it might be, but it is entertaining enough to watch.Grant is no singer, but he has considerable charm, and Smith is as always extremely attractive.  The supporting cast is remarkably strong, featuring the likes of Jane Wyman, Eve Arden, Dorothy Malone, and Alan Hale--and rare screen appearances by Monty Woolley and Mary Martin, who deliver knockout performances of &quot;Miss Otis Regrets&quot; and &quot;My Heart Belongs To Daddy&quot; respectively.  The DVD transfer is reasonable, and although the bonuses are pure fluff they are amusing.

And he was gay. Of course a movie of this era cannot be expected to deal with a subject that was then taboo. But casting the dashing Cary Grant as Cole Porter turns this movie into pure fantasy, if enjoyable fantasy. In the MGM musical about Rodgers and Hart, ""Words and Music,"" casting the role of Lorenz ""Larry"" Hart posed a similar problem. Hart was 4' 9"", alcoholic, and more or less openly gay. They at least made a stab at getting it right by casting the diminutive Mickey Rooney, and including many of Hart's mannerisms, such as his hyperactivity, penchant for smoking large cigars, and his habit of nervously rubbing his hands together. And there's a scene when Tom Drake as Rodgers gives Rooney a funny look when he he puts an arm on his shoulder while he is playing the piano. Very subtle but unmistakeable. Mickey Rooney as Hart is an honorable failure. The best that one can say about Cary Grant as Cole Porter is that Porter would certainly have liked to look like Grant. (And then there is ""Rhapsody in Blue,"" starring Robert Alda, who is a reasonable facsimile of the probably gay Gershwin, which invents two completely fictional female romantic interests for Gershwin, who never had any.) One piece of authenticity in the film is Monty Woolley, who was a classmate and friend of Porter at Yale. Monty was a scion of Manhattan high society, and Cole a social climber par excellence--and they both loved the theater.
