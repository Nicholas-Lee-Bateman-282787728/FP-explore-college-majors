These include age difference (and who cares how old the man you are feeling is?); Justin's Dad (who has his own past and current issues); Jack's Dad who has early stage dimentia (but has enough marbles to play Cupid) and the issues about Justin's career.  But the reality is that these don't hold anything up for long - in fact the build up of boy (ie in his 20's) meets man (46) and battle all that are keeping them apart takes all of a day or so...my kind of timeline, don't waste time on the inconsequentials get to the LOVE part.The production could have been better but it doesn't detract from a nice movie.  The actors need more work in their chosen field, as the other reviewers have said, but I think there is more naturalness in there than they have been given credit for - not a bad thing.  The script flowed in a natural dialogue for the most part - just the acting let it down in some parts - but that doesn't ruin it for me.I liked the premise, that love can result from a wrong turn - where can I make that wrong turn?More could have been made of the Justin's Father's (the towel boy) interlude with Jack in their younger days - a flashback would have introduced more sensuality/sex into the movie.Angora Ranch is long on looks and dialogue and very very light on actual sexual intimacy which is a bit disappointing.I don't think the spectre of dimentia or Alzheimers (they are different) and the affects on the individual and families was handled well.  The Dad may have been in the early stages but huge symptoms and effects were apparent - so what is the reality that someone would enter into a relationship with a man that age with that disease to the degree of moving him out of his son's house and into their own when they are running a business?  Very little.Overall the acting could be better but the cute bunnies make up for that.  A bit more sex is always welcome - speaking from personal experience and my preference for passion. BUT I LOVE a love story - as I keep saying.So on this stormy Sunday afternoon in New Zealand I give this movie a 4 out of 5 and will watch it again.

1018466,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B000I2J5TM,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[20, 24]","Justin is a gay man in his early 20's, working for his overbearing father's ad agency in Austin TX.  On a trip to a rural area to meet with a client, his car gets stuck right in front of the ""Angora Ranch"" (2006), a rabbit ranch run by Jack and his father Peter.  Although almost twice his age, Jack senses a mutual attraction with Justin, so Peter and the town's lady mechanic plot to get Justin to stay the night to give them a chance. Justin is too nervous about how his father will react to his having to postpone the meeting, and heads out to his meeting first thing in the morning, only to return when a stowaway bunny proves to be the key to the ad campaign.  With the pressure off, Justin and Jack do hit it off nicely, until Justin's father makes an unexpected visit to rant about their age difference and ""lifestyle"", but loses his thunder when a secret from his own youth comes out.The photography and production values are surprisingly good for a bare bones indie film shot directly on video.  However, I didn't have to check the IMDB credits to know the cast was inexperienced, as EVERY actor in the film came off like a night of amateur theatre tryouts, with horrible overacting, emoting as if each line was Shakespeare, and sometimes even looking at the camera instead of the character they are speaking with.  Thomas Romano as Justin was cute, but didn't really fit his character, and it is amazing that not ONE of the main characters in rural Texas had any trace of an accent.  The screenplay (by director Paul Bright, who also played Jack) is sweet and charming, but more than a bit overdone and contrived.  (However, it could have been worse; the extras divulge that the original concept was for this to be a MUSICAL!)  DVD has ""making of"" featurette and some candid shots.

1018468,AFZU6XDO5L75R,B000I2J5TM,"Darien Wells ""darien""","[1, 1]","I liked this film. It is certainly NOT the best one I've ever seen, but the story is well written and takes on a theme that is original and has a lot of warmth in it. As about every other reviewer has pointed out, the acting is not just great, and some of the scenes were a bit unbelievable. The towns people characters are corny and just a bit too spoofy, but that sad fact also gives it a light heartedness that was probably not fully intended. It does however add some appeal although I think it could have been made a whole lot better film with a little more professionalism and realism. Justin (Thomas Romano) swerves to miss a rabbit in the road and lands in the ditch in front of a farm house which just happens to be owned by a gay man twice his age. The plot begins, and the two quickly began bonding and eventually fall in love. Romano is not the greatest actor you'll ever watch but is quite adorable in looks and the way he carries himself. His older soon to be partner Jack is played by Paul Bright who also wrote and directed the film. The two ""actors"" both lack acting skills but manage to pull it off nonetheless. With a lot more work and practice, I feel that Romano probably has the ability within himself to act such a part well, but has not quite honed his acting skill. Bright would have directed a much better film had he cast someone else to play his role, and stuck to writing and directing. Perhaps the only believable actor was Tim Jones who was cast quite well in his part of Jack's senile father. Sadly he didn't live long after the film was released. This is WITHOUT DOUBT a low budget, ametuer production and with any other script would have made for a terrible film, however it somehow flows in spite of it's flaws and provides entertainment that the viewer isn't probably expecting. I like that this film does not explore all the status quo subjects that most films of today do. There's no stereotypes involved, no dark side of being gay exemplified here, no exploitation of the usual subjects of AIDS, drugs, one night stands, extreme feminism, it doesn't rely on stereotypical gay music, the gay bar scene and all that other stuff we see in about every film we watch. It also doesn't stereotype the rigidness of small rural area life, or the usual straight stereotypes either. For this reason, it does lack some realness and makes it a bit quirky but somehow manages to do so in a welcomed way. The love story is good, it provides something most of us, especially those of us older, can relate to. I just wish some cute hot young thing would knock on my door and somehow fall in love with me, but it is just a movie after all.The sound quality is as good or better than many of the better acted films I've seen in quite some time in spite of it's other flaws. The animals add a unique touch that lightens the film alot from most other productions. I don't want to under emphasize the flaws this film has, yet I also don't wish to deter anyone from viewing this film either. If you'll chill out, relax and allow yourself the opportunity to accept this one for what it is, I honestly believe you will enjoy watching it. It has no difficulty holding a viewers attention throughout the film and certainly doesn't leave you feeling at the end that you didn't get the story, or perhaps the ending of a story that you deserved for investing your time. This is no block buster folks, but it is a good film and one to just relax with and enjoy it's uniqueness and simple charm. I recommend it for your viewing, but also warn you not to expect a masterpiece of cinematography. There are a couple special features on the DVD including some candid screenshots and a ""behind the scenes"" commentary which is pretty good.

This little Indie film made on a shoestring budget is more like an updated Farmer's Daughter story and as such it has some charm.Justin (the very hunky Thomas Romano) is an ad executive whose father sends him on his first solo run to a place in Texas.  While driving to his appointment Justin swerves to avoid a rabbit in the road and his car gets stuck in a ditch that just happens to be in front of the home of Jack (Paul Bright, who also wrote and directed the film) and his loony senile father.  Jack's life partner died a few years back and he is determined his plight in life is to live in solitude as caretaker for his father.  Justin is invited to spend the night while his car is fixed by the local tow truck/mechanic.  And the story unfolds from there into a May December romance that while it may not be acted very well at all, has its moments of warmth.

There are rabbits, goats, horses and chickens (and the cat that managed to sneak into the dinner scene). But the romance is between two men who must overcome a different kind of animal: the paternal kind. Justin (Thomas Romano) is a 20-something cutie working for his father's advertising agency, a self-absorbed manipulator whom Justin can never satisfy. (And Daddy has a few secrets on the side.) Jack (Paul Bright, ""Angora Ranch's"" writer and director) is a gay widower who has a live-in father, Peter (Tim Jones, the movie's co-writer), that is trying to push ""his gay son Jackson"" into a relationship before he slips into total senility. A chance accident and a little of Peter's meddling drops Benny the Bunny squarely into the stew and a May/September romance begins in the suburbs of Austin, Texas.While the movie is certainly not a slick affair (in the extras, Bright and Jones joke about how their budget was in ""the thousands""), it does do several things the creators promise:No tragic gay man dies of AIDS.No screaming queen is running around disrupting things.No men are just straight-acting guys claiming they're gay.And most importantly - All gay male characters are actually played by gay men.The acting is not going to get any Academy Award nominations, but that isn't why you're going to enjoy this. ""Angora Ranch"" is a delight for the many things it isn't. Non-hyperactive, not bitter or angry, not political (other than the general wink at gay marriage) and not aimed at the tweaker circuit coming-out crowd.

During this scene one feels like they are on the date with the guys! A very touching and realistic date scene.For me (at first) I had issues with all the characters being played by gay men--including the straight roles (because all of us gay men tend to have some gay mannerisms or effeminacy, and that seemed to take away from the realism of certain straight characters in the film, I thought.) But then I realized how special it was to have a film that starred ALL gay men! How often does THAT happen?!!I loved the serious ""dad issues"" followed by quirkiness (like the scene in bed when both guys say ""Train!"" as one of the characters gets tossed from his bed by a passing train!) And loved the tender quirkiness when the younger guy says he's okay with sleeping on the sofa and the older guy says sadly, ""You are?"" (You'd have to see it to know what I mean.)
