And half the time they showed just the top half of the irish dancers. Well, THAT part doesn't move! at LEAST show the feet!I can kinda see it for a VHS tape, but this is a DVD - ever hear of multiple viewpoints? I'm sure they just dumped the VHS off to DVD without doing much to it - make some extra money and all that, but if they'd taken some care they could have had a WONDERFUL product and I wouldn't feel quite so seasick!OK, if you made it this far - if you saw and loved Riverdance, well, until they make a REAL DVD production, ya might as well buy this one! The production seems to match what Riverdance is all about, lots of flash!

7709,A1LB3QFH4O7693,0767804341,"""avrilyn""","[11, 12]","(Note: I geared this review towards Irish dancing fans who want to buy a Riverdance, but are not sure which one to get.)This is by far the best Riverdance to get, for several reasons. It is of higher quality: better stage, better costumes, etc.Also, there are great extra songs what the other does not have, such as:Trading Taps has a little &quot;showdown&quot; between three Irish dancers and two American black jazz dancers. It is very entertaining, humerous, and all around enjoyable. I really missed that in the first Riverdance. Oscail an Doras: One of my favorite Irish songs overall! It combines drums, singing and dancing. It also has a wonderful tune and great harmonies.Lift the Wings is a duet with a man and woman, and that really enhances the song.  It is beautiful.Freedom is much better. I did not like the Baptist choir they had. I have nothing against that style of music, but it definately did not fit with this show one bit. Now they have the regular singers performing, as well as a man with a really deep bass voice. Kind of like the man who sang &quot;Old Man River&quot; from Showboat.Firedance is not a duet. Maria Pages definately has enough charisma and presence to do a solo, and, IMHO, it is much better that way. Also, Michael Flately cannot do any suggestive petting.Besides having differences, this movie keeps many of the same winning features of the last one, such as the beautiful and talented Jean Butler (I swear she floats when she dances); the wonderful lady lead singer whose name I do not know, but has a hauntingly, achingly gorgeous voice; and the same great songs. Now I shall tell the best asset: Colin Dunne. Michael Flatley may think he is lord of the Dance, but Colin Dunne IS the dance. All one has to do is look at his face, and see the expression of pure bliss. The best thing about him is that, to him, the audience dissapears, which obviously does not happen with Michael Flatley. Flatley is a performer, and, while there is nothing wrong with that, that interferes with the actual show. I think the best way to compare the two is to look at how they stand after some dances.  After Reel Around the Sun, Flately stands straight up with his arms outstretched, obstructing the view of the dancers behind him. Dunne, after another song, stands with is head down, and hands pointing backwards towards them, drawing the viewer's gaze backwards. One more thing: I have seen it mentioned on other reviews that Dunne's chemistry with Jean Butler was not as good as Flatley's. I disagree; it is better. The only person Flatley has chemistry with is himself. Dunne and Butler have respect for eachother; that is obvious.In short, if you are getting one Riverdance, get this one. If you can get both, get both! For, as some people say, the camera is not always used to its full potential. However, it is hardly bothersome. I can assure you that you will be hard pressed to find a better-spent 2 hours than the time spent watching this film.",5,The best!,997833600,"08 15, 2001",2001,2982,"['Note', 'geared', 'review', 'Irish', 'dancing', 'fans', 'who', 'want', 'buy', 'Riverdance', 'are', 'not', 'sure', 'one', 'get', 'far', 'best', 'Riverdance', 'get', 'several', 'reasons', 'higher', 'quality', 'better', 'stage', 'better', 'costumes', 'etc.Also', 'are', 'great', 'extra', 'songs', 'what', 'other', 'not', 'have', 'such', 'Trading', 'Taps', 'little', 'quot', 'quot', 'three', 'Irish', 'dancers', 'two', 'American', 'black', 'jazz', 'dancers', 'very', 'entertaining', 'humerous', 'around', 'enjoyable', 'really', 'missed', 'first', 'Riverdance', 'Oscail', 'Doras', 'One', 'favorite', 'Irish', 'songs', 'overall', 'drums', 'singing', 'dancing', 'also', 'wonderful', 'tune', 'great', 'harmonies.Lift', 'Wings', 'duet', 'man', 'woman', 'really', 'song', 'beautiful.Freedom', 'much', 'better', 'did', 'not', 'Baptist', 'choir', 'had', 'have', 'nothing', 'style', 'music', 'definately', 'did', 'not', 'fit', 'show', 'one', 'bit', 'Now', 'have', 'regular', 'singers', 'performing', 'as', 'well', 'man', 'really', 'deep', 'bass', 'voice', 'Kind', 'man', 'who', 'sang', 'quot', 'Old', 'Man', 'River', 'quot', 'Showboat.Firedance', 'not', 'duet', 'Maria', 'Pages', 'definately', 'enough', 'charisma', 'presence', 'do', 'solo', 'IMHO', 'much', 'better', 'way', 'Also', 'Michael', 'Flately', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'suggestive', 'petting.Besides', 'having', 'differences', 'movie', 'many', 'same', 'winning', 'features', 'last', 'one', 'such', 'beautiful', 'talented', 'Jean', 'Butler', 'swear', 'when', 'wonderful', 'lady', 'lead', 'singer', 'name', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'hauntingly', 'achingly', 'gorgeous', 'voice', 'same', 'great', 'songs', 'Now', 'shall', 'tell', 'best', 'asset', 'Colin', 'Dunne', 'Michael', 'Flatley', 'may', 'think', 'lord', 'Dance', 'Colin', 'Dunne', 'dance', 'one', 'do', 'look', 'face', 'see', 'expression', 'pure', 'bliss', 'best', 'thing', 'audience', 'dissapears', 'obviously', 'not', 'happen', 'Michael', 'Flatley', 'Flatley', 'performer', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'actual', 'show', 'think', 'best', 'way', 'compare', 'two', 'look', 'how', 'stand', 'dances', 'Reel', 'Sun', 'Flately', 'straight', 'up', 'arms', 'outstretched', 'obstructing', 'view', 'dancers', 'Dunne', 'song', 'head', 'down', 'hands', 'pointing', 'backwards', 'towards', 'drawing', 'viewer', 'gaze', 'backwards', 'One', 'more', 'thing', 'have', 'seen', 'mentioned', 'other', 'reviews', 'Dunne', 'chemistry', 'Jean', 'Butler', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Flatley', 'disagree', 'better', 'only', 'person', 'Flatley', 'chemistry', 'Dunne', 'Butler', 'have', 'respect', 'eachother', 'obvious.In', 'short', 'are', 'getting', 'one', 'Riverdance', 'get', 'one', 'can', 'get', 'get', 'people', 'say', 'camera', 'not', 'always', 'used', 'full', 'potential', 'However', 'hardly', 'bothersome', 'can', 'assure', 'will', 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'find', 'better-spent', '2', 'hours', 'time', 'spent', 'watching', 'film']",N/A

7713,A39CX0EE4BZCZC,0767804341,Craig Connell,"[1, 1]","This is a ""revised"" Riverdance presentation, staged at Radio City Music hall in New York City. Of the three Irish ""dance"" musicals that I watched during the mid to late '90s (which includes the first ""Riverdance"" and ""Lord of the Dance"") I liked this one the best.I thought it was better than the original, held in Dublin, Ireland, because it adds segments that are mostly good, it has a more varied and colorful stage setting and it eliminated apiece for two from that original that wasn't good to begin with. This is just a very solid show with few weak spots. To be certain, there are some songs/dances that are just ""fair"" but none that are poor, which is amazing considering there are 20 numbers in all.The cast is similar to the first Riverdance with the main exception of Colin Dunne replacing Michael Flatley as the featured dancer. Both are extremely talented. The major difference might be in their looks with Dunne a little, goateed black-haired guy while Flatley is the clean-shaven blond. I prefer Dunne because Flatley's ego is so big he gets annoying at times. The female lead, Jean Butler, thankfully, is still there and is great to watch: what graceful beauty and talent! Butler and the rest of these women have the greatest legs I've seen on dancers.I also enjoyed the dancing of Maria Pages, a Spanish flamenco performer, and two guys: Daniel B. Wooten and Ivan Thomas. One number - with those two pairing off against Dunne and two other dancers - is called ""Trading Taps"" and is terrific fun to watch, maybe the highlight of the whole show. I have no complaints about violinist Eileen Ivers, either.The ""fast"" Irish songs here appealed to me the most. I appreciated the audience not getting in the way of the performance either with shrieks and screams like the women do in the ""Lord Of The Dance"" video.",4,My Favorite Of The 'Riverdance' Performances Of The '90s,1189123200,"09 7, 2007",2007,1824,"['revised', 'Riverdance', 'presentation', 'staged', 'Radio', 'City', 'Music', 'hall', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'three', 'Irish', 'dance', 'musicals', 'watched', 'mid', 'late', ""'90s"", 'first', 'Riverdance', 'Lord', 'Dance', 'liked', 'one', 'best.I', 'thought', 'was', 'better', 'original', 'held', 'Dublin', 'Ireland', 'segments', 'are', 'mostly', 'good', 'more', 'varied', 'colorful', 'stage', 'setting', 'eliminated', 'apiece', 'two', 'original', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'begin', 'just', 'very', 'solid', 'show', 'few', 'weak', 'spots', 'be', 'certain', 'are', 'songs/dances', 'are', 'just', 'fair', 'none', 'are', 'poor', 'amazing', 'considering', 'are', '20', 'numbers', 'all.The', 'cast', 'similar', 'first', 'Riverdance', 'main', 'exception', 'Colin', 'Dunne', 'replacing', 'Michael', 'Flatley', 'featured', 'dancer', 'are', 'extremely', 'talented', 'major', 'difference', 'might', 'be', 'looks', 'Dunne', 'little', 'goateed', 'black-haired', 'guy', 'Flatley', 'clean-shaven', 'blond', 'prefer', 'Dunne', 'Flatley', 'ego', 'so', 'big', 'annoying', 'times', 'female', 'lead', 'Jean', 'Butler', 'thankfully', 'still', 'great', 'watch', 'what', 'graceful', 'beauty', 'talent', 'Butler', 'rest', 'women', 'have', 'greatest', 'legs', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'dancers.I', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'dancing', 'Maria', 'Pages', 'Spanish', 'flamenco', 'performer', 'two', 'guys', 'Daniel', 'B.', 'Wooten', 'Ivan', 'Thomas', 'One', 'number', 'two', 'pairing', 'off', 'Dunne', 'two', 'other', 'dancers', 'called', 'Trading', 'Taps', 'terrific', 'fun', 'watch', 'maybe', 'highlight', 'whole', 'show', 'have', 'complaints', 'violinist', 'Eileen', 'Ivers', 'fast', 'Irish', 'songs', 'here', 'appealed', 'most', 'appreciated', 'audience', 'not', 'getting', 'way', 'performance', 'shrieks', 'screams', 'women', 'do', 'Lord', 'Dance', 'video']",N/A
7714,AKDXXW89ZLCJS,0767804341,Cybele A. Baker,"[144, 159]","Let me just say this, I am an Irish dancer, have been dancing with some modest success off and on for 15 years or more.I've even performed in a mini Riverdance/LOTD type show. Affectionatly called Puddledance. :-)So here goes: I like both shows, I also like both dancers (i.e. Colin vs. Michael)Yes MF probably has/had more skill than Colin. However Colin is a much less ego-centric person and is IMHO easier and at times more enjoyable to watch.I appreciate what MF has brought to both shows, however I find Riverdance a better overall production and here is why;1. The costumes do not look like some tacky combination between the worst of Irish dance competition wear and a Vegas showgirl show. They are simple, subtle and work well with the dancing. (Have you seen Feet of Flames and that ridiculous cape they made Dair nolan dance with!! Or the UGLY catsuit they put the Gypsy girl in..oh god the list is endless...)ANY show knows you need to have appropriate costumes to carry off the theme fo the show. I wish someone had told MF that.2. As much as MF is/was a brilliant dancer and is a pretty good coreographer he spends way too much time in the world of ME ME ME and does not show even half the joy Colin shows when he is dancing. Nor does he let his co-stars shine too brightly, lest they dim his own star. I really do like the man folks but it is so OBVIOUS. And I am sorry just becuase the man has done so well does not give him an excuse to be so arrogant that is not OK in my book at all. Humility will get you more acolades than arrogance.3. Riverdance is more well rounded it doesn't go over the top, it shows you a good mix of what Irish dancing is, what it can be and shows how it compares and contrasts with other forms of Dance. That in and of itself makes it a bit stronger than all the MF shows combined.4. Colin vs. Michael is just silly, two different men, two diffent skill levels. And honestly Colin does more actual ""Irish"" dancing than Michael has done in ALL the shows combined. MF style is more a hybrid of Irish and US Tap dancing with WAY too much posturing and goofing around without as much real dancing going on. So the fact is does Colin make mistakes? Yes, of course he does, Irish dance is VERY difficult dance style in many ways it is as dificult and requires as much training as Ballet. But it is even more complex than ballet and every single Irish dancer in the world has bad days and good days. Unfortunatley sometimes those bad days happen at the wrong moment, i.e. The Grammys.So anyway while I enjoy Mr. Flatley's shows Riverdance is a much stronger show without him and as a whole is a better example of the best of Irish dancing. Regardless of the he said/she said debate over who contributed what, Riverdance had its vision MF had another so they separated. MF was never technically ""fired"" he refused to go on until the issues was resolved the way he wanted and they couldn't reach a middle ground, it happens all the time folks. And personally I'm glad it did, because we got a whole new group of shows that may never had exisited if MF had stayed with Riverdance. I like both as I said, I just think Riverdance is a bit stronger than the various LOTD shows.Now if we could just re-train camera men to properly film these shows it would be lovely!!!!",4,Which is better RD or LOTD?

Perez ""Jose""","[9, 11]","By now, ""Riverdance"" has become an indelible part of popular culture, both exalted as a brilliant one-of-a--kind theatrical experience and exhausted as a concept by copycat companies around the world -- and Las Vegas (think Michael Flatley)!  The original Riverdance, however, is a thrilling ride - a lyrical tale of the evolution of dance set against the Irish struggle for Independence.  For sheer magic, however, you don't need to be Irish to appreciate the beauty and grace with which this story is told...both in music and dance.  Although newer companies may visit your town every year around St. Patty's Day, the original Riverdance is a coup of the human spirit - a dizzying swirl of gosamer feet that seem to lift off the stage.  Seeing ""Riverdance"" in person during its first incarnation was easily one of the top 10 highlights in my own theater loving life.  But - instead of splurging for tickets to a sub-par production, I heartily recommend watching this DVD first.  That way, you'll experience the magic as it was meant to be experienced and then be able to decide if you really need to see it on stage.  Beware of poor imitators like Flatley, whose ""Feet of Flames"" is a bit over the (narcisistic top) --- just plug in this DVD, crank up the volume, and bear witness to the original one-of-a-kind thrill-ride that IS ""Riverdance.""

7720,ARA8SJ6IQZ1Q,0767804341,"Karl Henning ""Composer & Clarinetist""","[6, 7]","The Flatley-vs.-Dunne controversy finds us enjoying both versions of the show greatly. Yes, Flatley is more of an extrovert than Colin Dunne; Flatley is a one-of-a-kind performer/choreographer - but that fact doesn't make Dunne chopped liver, and in fact Dunne dances terrifically in this version of the show. (Rightly considered, it is even to Flatley's credit as the creator and ""owner"" of the show, that ""Riverdance"" survived his departure.)Dunne dances brilliantly, and collaborates very well with Jean Butler. Dunne's reserve is a kind of classical manner, and not at all any lack of ""gusto."" This is particularly obvious in the sequence which begins as a 'duet' between Maria Pag&eacute;s and a drummer, and which turns into a trio as Dunne appears in a spotlight. Likewise, the call-&-response of the ""Trading Taps"" sequence is fabulous; if anyone seeing Dunne dance this, finds him an ""empty technician,"" why, perhaps there is something to be said for ""empty technique"" after all ....Pag&eacute;s is always a treat, and was always the ""third principal"" in this show for us. Composer Bill Whelan pulls off some charming sonic feats, by making a small, and mostly Irish-folk-instrument, pit band provide perfectly convincing accompaniments not only for the Irish dance numbers, but for Pag&eacute;s' brilliant flamenco, and for the (strangely heterogeneous, though this will escape most Western viewers) pan-former-Soviet-Union stuff danced by former members of the Moiseyev Company, a troupe which is internationally renowned for their brilliant folk dancing, folk dancing produced at a level on par with Russian ballet, which of course is one of the great dance traditions on the planet.The ""choral"" sections are our least favorite part of the show. The ""behind-the-scenes footage"" is little more than a euphemism for a brief commercial for the show, pleasant to watch, of course, but we felt that there was an opportunity missed for much more material of real interest. Yes, the frantic editing is sometimes a distraction (and there are shots which cut out the dancers' feet, and pans from the back of the hall, which could be done without nicely).None of these minor complaints, though, seriously detracts from the impact of the show.",5,Must We Choose Just One of the Two?,1040947200,"12 27, 2002",2002,2244,"['Flatley-vs.-Dunne', 'controversy', 'enjoying', 'versions', 'show', 'greatly', 'Yes', 'Flatley', 'more', 'extrovert', 'Colin', 'Dunne', 'Flatley', 'one-of-a-kind', 'performer/choreographer', 'fact', ""n't"", 'make', 'Dunne', 'chopped', 'liver', 'fact', 'Dunne', 'terrifically', 'version', 'show', 'Rightly', 'considered', 'even', 'Flatley', 'credit', 'creator', 'owner', 'show', 'Riverdance', 'survived', 'departure', 'Dunne', 'brilliantly', 'very', 'well', 'Jean', 'Butler', 'Dunne', 'reserve', 'kind', 'classical', 'manner', 'not', 'lack', 'gusto', 'particularly', 'obvious', 'sequence', ""'duet"", 'Maria', 'Pag', 'eacute', 's', 'drummer', 'trio', 'Dunne', 'spotlight', 'Likewise', 'call-', '-response', 'Trading', 'Taps', 'sequence', 'fabulous', 'anyone', 'seeing', 'Dunne', 'dance', 'empty', 'technician', 'why', 'perhaps', 'something', 'be', 'said', 'empty', 'technique', '.Pag', 'eacute', 'always', 'treat', 'was', 'always', 'third', 'principal', 'show', 'Composer', 'Bill', 'Whelan', 'charming', 'sonic', 'feats', 'making', 'small', 'mostly', 'Irish-folk-instrument', 'pit', 'band', 'provide', 'perfectly', 'convincing', 'accompaniments', 'not', 'only', 'Irish', 'dance', 'numbers', 'Pag', 'eacute', 'brilliant', 'flamenco', 'strangely', 'heterogeneous', 'will', 'escape', 'most', 'Western', 'viewers', 'pan-former-Soviet-Union', 'stuff', 'danced', 'former', 'members', 'Moiseyev', 'Company', 'troupe', 'internationally', 'renowned', 'brilliant', 'folk', 'dancing', 'folk', 'dancing', 'produced', 'level', 'par', 'Russian', 'ballet', 'course', 'one', 'great', 'dance', 'traditions', 'planet.The', 'choral', 'sections', 'are', 'least', 'favorite', 'part', 'show', 'behind-the-scenes', 'footage', 'little', 'more', 'euphemism', 'brief', 'commercial', 'show', 'pleasant', 'watch', 'course', 'felt', 'was', 'opportunity', 'missed', 'much', 'more', 'material', 'real', 'interest', 'Yes', 'frantic', 'editing', 'sometimes', 'distraction', 'are', 'shots', 'cut', 'out', 'dancers', 'feet', 'pans', 'back', 'hall', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'nicely', '.None', 'minor', 'complaints', 'though', 'seriously', 'impact', 'show']",N/A

This is the greatest abuser of the three.  There are three major problems: 1) not filming the dancers full  body, 2) stage lighting (not the best for filming, though fine for viewing  a live performance), and 3) excessive changes in camera angle.  Of these  three, the second is forgiveable, being unavoidable if one is filming  before a live audience but one and three are not!  As to one, there was  extensive work done by Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly in the early days of the  musical that worked out the best ways to film dance.  Only one completely  ignorant of filming technique would fail to film full body.  As for three,  I can tell you that there are nine cameras in New York's Radio City Music  Hall.  How do I know?  BECAUSE THE FILMOGRAPHER SWITCHED CAMERAS EVERY  10-15 SECONDS OF EVERY FLIPPING DANCE!  HELLO, we do not ALL watch an  excessive quantities of MTV, thank you very much!  This is distracting at  best and at worst it totally disrupts the ability to appreciate the flow of  the movement.  Additionally, if you've already seen the Michael Flatley  film there is very little of interest or improvement (unless you dislike  his work, in which case you may like this).  The only major change is a  &quot;dance down&quot; pitting American tap against Irish step.  This  particular number, were it film properly, would be worth the price of  adding this work to your collection, even if it already included the  original &quot;Riverdance&quot;, but, as it is, forget it!  Rent it on  video, see the number, and forget wasting you well-earned money on this  forgetable turkey.

The older women that sings ""Lift the Wings"" brought shivers down my spine. I just love that song! ""Freedom"" was done by a gospel choir and I can't forget ""The Russian Dervish"", which was very colorful; performed by three men and three women, who do some amazing stunts as they twirl through this number.

True, I loved the original Riverdance with Flatley, but I think that in the original, his dancing was a few nothces above that of his co-preformers. He carried the entire production.  Watch them both back to back and see what you think.Maria Pages and Jean Butler must have just got better overtime, because they steal the show from Dunne.  No knock on Dunne his dancing is great, but he doesn't have the on-stage presence of Flatley.  It's the other dancers here who are worth the watch.In the original Riverdance, Pages's feet are flat, thumpy and lag behind the beat sometimes.  When Flatley came on to the screen, he just danced circles around her. She has developed wondefully as a dancer.  Butler was a natural at the release of the original Riverdance, but she too seems to have become more confident and less mechanical.  She is more graceful then ever here.Furthermore, the NYC production has a big budget set and sound.  The light show makes the original Riverdance look as though it was filmed in a converted high school gymnasium.  The music is clearer in the NYC production and Celtic poetry is thrown in before each dance as punctuation.I also hear a chorus of people saying that they do not like this DVD because of ""technical"" issues and I'm wondering if somehow a glitched batch of copies were released.
