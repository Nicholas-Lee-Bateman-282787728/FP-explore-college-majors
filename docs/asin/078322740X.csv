She quickly gets acquainted with local people, charges everything to the architect's account and gets to meet even his parents, to him she presents herself as the architect's wife.  As unique as she is - an acquired taste, as her make-believe inlaws would say, she has a very charming personality and everybody delights in her presence.  Whatever the situation, she always has a ready answer, often backed with a wild and outrageous story.When Martin shows up at his newly-built house and finds her there, he is at first stunned, but figures that the only way to get out of it is by incorporating and continuing her make-believe stories and inventing that they are now getting divorced.  Not only her parents get involved, but also the local priest, who acts as a marriage counsellor, attempting to help them rescue the marriage.Steve Martin is not so good at coming with impromptu answers and he usually botches things up, but Goldie Hawn, quite experienced at playing the game, always manages to rescue the situation.  She utterly enjoys playing the game and continues playing her own agenda.  She even manages to get him promoted.All the events draw attention of his high-school sweatheart who develops some new interest in him - though they face themselves once again with their individual preferences as Martin discovers that he much prefers to live in a wild and imaginary world of Goldie Hawn, which has infused him with added spice and zest for life.",5,Lots of Laughs,1102291200,"12 6, 2004",2004,2481,"['charming', 'comedy', 'played', 'superbly', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'Goldie', 'Hawn.Martin', 'decently', 'successful', 'architect', 'talent', 'build', 'house', 'high-school', 'sweatheart', 'rather', 'romantically', 'inclined', 'engagement', 'gift', 'wrapped', 'big', 'red', 'ribbon', 'away', 'high-school', 'sweatheart', 'being', 'too', 'imaginative', 'living', 'fantasy-land', 'being', 'down-to-earth', 'man', ""'d"", 'prefer', 'be', 'with.Heartbroken', 'up', 'Hungarian', 'restaurant', 'wash', 'away', 'woes', 'eventually', 'out', 'heart', 'waitress', 'played', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'who', ""n't"", 'stop', 'beat', 'take', 'advantage', 'situation', 'adventurous', 'free-spirit', 'endowed', 'wild', 'imagination', 'who', 'life', 'be', 'experienced', ""'ll"", 'do', 'whatever', 'experience', 'richness', 'life.After', 'spending', 'one', 'night', 'architect', 'promptly', 'packs', 'unbeknonst', 'move', 'newly', 'built', 'house', 'why', 'leave', 'lovely', 'house', 'empty', 'quickly', 'acquainted', 'local', 'people', 'charges', 'everything', 'architect', 'account', 'meet', 'even', 'parents', 'architect', 'wife', 'As', 'unique', 'acquired', 'taste', 'make-believe', 'inlaws', 'would', 'say', 'very', 'charming', 'personality', 'everybody', 'delights', 'presence', 'situation', 'always', 'ready', 'answer', 'often', 'backed', 'wild', 'outrageous', 'story.When', 'Martin', 'up', 'newly-built', 'house', 'there', 'first', 'stunned', 'only', 'way', 'get', 'incorporating', 'continuing', 'make-believe', 'stories', 'inventing', 'are', 'now', 'getting', 'divorced', 'Not', 'only', 'parents', 'get', 'involved', 'also', 'local', 'priest', 'who', 'marriage', 'counsellor', 'attempting', 'help', 'rescue', 'marriage.Steve', 'Martin', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'coming', 'impromptu', 'answers', 'usually', 'things', 'up', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'quite', 'experienced', 'playing', 'game', 'always', 'rescue', 'situation', 'utterly', 'playing', 'game', 'playing', 'own', 'agenda', 'even', 'get', 'promoted.All', 'events', 'draw', 'attention', 'high-school', 'sweatheart', 'who', 'new', 'interest', 'face', 'once', 'again', 'individual', 'preferences', 'Martin', 'much', 'prefers', 'live', 'wild', 'imaginary', 'world', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'infused', 'added', 'spice', 'zest', 'life']",Housesitter

If my wife didn't give me this for a birthday or something and I wasn't just in the mood to watch something different this evening I would have never picked up on this great little movie. We need to get the word out! My take: agreed this is a great team to pull this off. The non-surprise ending could have been so hoaky but they actually did it in a way I was glad Becky finally got left out of it. Let her find her own match if there is one. But I see a whole lot of depth in the whole point of this comedy. It is all true! None of this was a con. That is the beauty of it. The beauty of it is the con. This is so true in so many ways, and we love it and know we do. So the movie is not just cute, not just funny. It has a very serious point about life to make if we just see it.
