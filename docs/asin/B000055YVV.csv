567469,A2V8OVZV3NKXLR,B000055YVV,A Customer,"[2, 2]","I first saw a DVD of this movie in a Christian bookstore, and while I was intrigued to see it, at the same time I was also wary , what with the number of so-so Biblical movies popping up. Even more so, I had never heard of the film until that moment (which is strange, because I'm usually abreast with the Hallmark movies, or so I thought), so I decided to do some ""research"" on it.From what I had gleaned, it managed to pique my curiosity. Of course, that is not the definitive telling on whether a movie is good or bad, but I finally decided this one was worth a shot.As it turns out, it was even more than worth a shot.This film is gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous. Hallmark always does a good job with their historical movies, and this did not disappoint. I was especially impressed with the Egyptian scenery. It was just breathtaking. Right down to the tiniest extra, the film really brought this lost word to life.I was also eager to see the portrayal of Joseph, as Joseph is one of my favourite Biblical heroes. And I was awed. Eddie Cibrian did a *stupendous* job (even that is too weak a word to describe it). He even looked the part - fit the role to a T, to use a cliche. I daresay he is the closest to how Joseph must have really looked like. :) My only regret is that he didn't have enough screen time.Another scene I also loved was the starry night of Abraham, wherein God was telling him that his descandants would be as numerous as the stars. That was beautiful, as well.Overall, another gem from Hallmark that will last a lifetime.",5,A Gorgeous Retelling of the Bible,1290729600,"11 26, 2010",2010,1545,"['first', 'saw', 'DVD', 'movie', 'Christian', 'bookstore', 'was', 'intrigued', 'see', 'same', 'time', 'was', 'also', 'wary', 'what', 'number', 'so-so', 'Biblical', 'movies', 'popping', 'up', 'Even', 'more', 'so', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'film', 'moment', 'strange', ""'m"", 'usually', 'abreast', 'Hallmark', 'movies', 'so', 'thought', 'decided', 'do', 'research', 'what', 'had', 'gleaned', 'managed', 'pique', 'curiosity', 'course', 'not', 'definitive', 'telling', 'movie', 'good', 'bad', 'finally', 'decided', 'one', 'was', 'shot.As', 'out', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'shot.This', 'film', 'gorgeous', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'Hallmark', 'always', 'good', 'job', 'historical', 'movies', 'did', 'not', 'disappoint', 'was', 'especially', 'impressed', 'Egyptian', 'scenery', 'was', 'just', 'breathtaking', 'Right', 'down', 'tiniest', 'extra', 'film', 'really', 'brought', 'lost', 'word', 'life.I', 'was', 'also', 'eager', 'see', 'portrayal', 'Joseph', 'Joseph', 'one', 'favourite', 'Biblical', 'heroes', 'was', 'awed', 'Eddie', 'Cibrian', 'did', '*stupendous*', 'job', 'even', 'too', 'weak', 'word', 'describe', 'even', 'looked', 'part', 'fit', 'role', 'T', 'use', 'cliche', 'daresay', 'closest', 'how', 'Joseph', 'must', 'have', 'really', 'looked', 'only', 'regret', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'screen', 'scene', 'also', 'loved', 'was', 'starry', 'night', 'Abraham', 'wherein', 'God', 'was', 'telling', 'descandants', 'would', 'be', 'as', 'numerous', 'stars', 'was', 'beautiful', 'well.Overall', 'gem', 'Hallmark', 'will', 'last', 'lifetime']",In the Beginning

I specifically remember watching the first 2 hours and realizing I could find a better way to spend my time than sitting through the last two hours.The performances are uniformly mediocre, with only Martin Landau standing out as Abraham.  The scenes of creation, including Adam and Eve, as well as the Fall, are quite nicely told through flashback, as Abraham tells the story around a campfire.  But, it quickly falls apart after that.If you really want to watch the story of Joseph, Moses, and the rest, I recommend watching the animated films JOSEPH and PRINCE of EGYPT.

567471,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B000055YVV,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[15, 16]","Originally a 4-hour miniseries for NBC, with a large international cast of well-known actors, this telling of parts of the first five books of the Bible is interesting, and on the whole flows well, though it crams a lot of story into one film, therefore skipping many major events.It starts with Abraham, as he travels to the land of Canaan, in about 2000 B.C., and along the way he recites the narrative of the Creation (which has some nice visuals), the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve, their temptation (the fruit here looks more like a small fig in a very thorny tree) and their expulsion from Eden.There are some fine performances, among them Martin Landau as Abraham, Jacqueline Bisset as Sarah, Bill Campbell as Moses, Amanda Donohoe as Potiphar's wife, and Fred Weller as Jacob. Eddie Cibrian as Joseph seems at first out of place, looking more like a modern day hunk, but he grows with the part, and has the most touching scene in the film, when he is reunited with his father Jacob. In the small part of Jethro, the great Alan Bates is marvelous. Other name actors include Diana Rigg (mature Rebeccah), Geraldine Chaplin (Yocheved), David Warner (Eliezer), and Christopher Lee is a theatrical, entertaining Ramses I.At times there's quite a bit of license taken with scripture (for instance, there is some incredulous dialogue between Moses and Jethro after the parting of the sea, where Moses doesn't seem to have much faith in God), and similar to other TV Bible films, the parts that take place in Egypt are full of gaudy sets and costumes, as well as some characters who have an almost Alice Cooper look in the makeup department, especially Pharaoh's magician (Victor Spinetti).Filmed in Morocco, with lovely cinematography and score, this one is certainly worth a rental if you like Bible epics.",4,good cast and above average TV production,1090713600,"07 25, 2004",2004,1807,"['Originally', '4-hour', 'miniseries', 'NBC', 'large', 'international', 'cast', 'well-known', 'actors', 'telling', 'parts', 'first', 'five', 'books', 'Bible', 'interesting', 'whole', 'well', 'lot', 'story', 'one', 'film', 'therefore', 'skipping', 'many', 'major', 'events.It', 'Abraham', 'land', 'Canaan', '2000', 'B.C.', 'way', 'narrative', 'Creation', 'nice', 'visuals', 'Garden', 'Eden', 'Adam', 'Eve', 'temptation', 'fruit', 'here', 'more', 'small', 'fig', 'very', 'thorny', 'tree', 'expulsion', 'Eden.There', 'are', 'fine', 'performances', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'Abraham', 'Jacqueline', 'Bisset', 'Sarah', 'Bill', 'Campbell', 'Moses', 'Amanda', 'Donohoe', 'Potiphar', 'wife', 'Fred', 'Weller', 'Jacob', 'Eddie', 'Cibrian', 'Joseph', 'first', 'place', 'looking', 'more', 'modern', 'day', 'hunk', 'part', 'most', 'touching', 'scene', 'film', 'when', 'reunited', 'father', 'Jacob', 'small', 'part', 'Jethro', 'great', 'Alan', 'Bates', 'marvelous', 'Other', 'name', 'actors', 'include', 'Diana', 'Rigg', 'mature', 'Rebeccah', 'Geraldine', 'Chaplin', 'Yocheved', 'David', 'Warner', 'Eliezer', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'theatrical', 'entertaining', 'Ramses', 'I.At', 'quite', 'bit', 'license', 'taken', 'scripture', 'instance', 'incredulous', 'dialogue', 'Moses', 'Jethro', 'parting', 'sea', 'where', 'Moses', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'much', 'faith', 'God', 'similar', 'other', 'TV', 'Bible', 'films', 'parts', 'take', 'place', 'Egypt', 'are', 'full', 'gaudy', 'sets', 'costumes', 'as', 'well', 'characters', 'who', 'have', 'almost', 'Alice', 'Cooper', 'look', 'makeup', 'department', 'especially', 'Pharaoh', 'magician', 'Victor', 'Spinetti', '.Filmed', 'Morocco', 'lovely', 'cinematography', 'score', 'one', 'certainly', 'worth', 'rental', 'like', 'Bible', 'epics']",In the Beginning

The production value is great and the special effects are quite good being a film made for television. Martin Landau is great in the role of Abraham. Here the positive praise ends however. Much of the biblical stories have been changed and some changed beyond recognition.
