E Jackson,"[0, 2]","The Craving definitely falls under the category of being so bad you *need* to see it, if for no other reason than to get a few solid laughs in.It's about a group of teenagers who travel in a van across the confusing maze-like desert, and then eventually stumble upon ugly, howling creatures that only appear at night.  Of course eventually these creatures become the center of attention and desire to kill the teens one by one.The entire film looks like it was recorded using a home video camera.  It's THAT low budget and horrendous looking.  It looks like it was recorded over 30 years ago thanks to the blurry, fainted picture quality.  No, it's not my television screen either.Also, a good portion of the Craving takes place a night so it's very hard to actually SEE what's taking place half of the time.The acting?  HAHAHA!  There is none.There is however, a small bit of tension in the atmosphere.  Obviously the writers were going for a Hills Have Eyes type of horror, and of course it's *nowhere* as good, but at least there's an attempt to replicate that style which means the writers at least tried.You'll probably never see something this bad come on a TV station- I imagine it's one of those ""release straight to DVD"" type of films.  Either way, you're not missing much.My favorite scene was probably the one where the teenage boy stuck his head through a hole in the wall where a creature was lurking on the other side, and when his teen friends pulled him back to safety... it was too late, so the only thing the kids seen was a bloody skull, haha.  Awesome.Watch it if you're interested in some laughs.",3,don't pick up the dog- leave him be,1294272000,"01 6, 2011",2011,1617,"['Craving', 'definitely', 'category', 'being', 'so', 'bad', '*need*', 'see', 'other', 'reason', 'get', 'few', 'solid', 'in.It', 'group', 'teenagers', 'who', 'travel', 'van', 'confusing', 'maze-like', 'desert', 'then', 'eventually', 'stumble', 'ugly', 'howling', 'creatures', 'only', 'appear', 'night', 'course', 'eventually', 'creatures', 'become', 'center', 'attention', 'desire', 'kill', 'teens', 'one', 'one.The', 'entire', 'film', 'was', 'recorded', 'using', 'home', 'video', 'camera', 'THAT', 'low', 'budget', 'horrendous', 'looking', 'was', 'recorded', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'thanks', 'blurry', 'fainted', 'picture', 'quality', 'No', 'not', 'television', 'screen', 'either.Also', 'good', 'portion', 'Craving', 'place', 'night', 'very', 'hard', 'actually', 'SEE', 'what', 'taking', 'place', 'half', 'time.The', 'acting', 'HAHAHA', 'none.There', 'however', 'small', 'bit', 'tension', 'atmosphere', 'Obviously', 'writers', 'were', 'going', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'type', 'horror', 'course', '*nowhere*', 'good', 'least', 'attempt', 'replicate', 'style', 'writers', 'least', 'tried.You', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'never', 'see', 'something', 'bad', 'come', 'TV', 'station-', 'imagine', 'one', 'release', 'straight', 'DVD', 'type', 'films', 'way', ""'re"", 'not', 'missing', 'much.My', 'favorite', 'scene', 'was', 'probably', 'one', 'where', 'teenage', 'boy', 'stuck', 'head', 'hole', 'wall', 'where', 'creature', 'was', 'lurking', 'other', 'side', 'when', 'teen', 'friends', 'pulled', 'back', 'safety', 'was', 'too', 'late', 'only', 'thing', 'kids', 'seen', 'was', 'bloody', 'skull', 'haha', 'Awesome.Watch', ""'re"", 'interested', 'laughs']",The Craving

I wasted time on watching this movie last night and feel embarrassed to say I finished it to the end. (mostly for the laughs of how bad!). Terrible acting and dialogue. I made a game at counting how many times the phrase, ""what the f...!"" was said. I think the director of the movie bought the camera to film this at a local Salvation Army. The so called ""twist"" on the monster was horrendously ridiculous. If you would like a night where you and some friends want to sit and have a ""Mystery Science Theater"" make fun of fest, than this would be recommended. Other than that do not waste your time and money.

1186739,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B001EWVDX6,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 1]","Five annoying young people on a road trip, stranded in the desert, prey to a horrible monster, yada yada yada.  Why does every other horror director keep using this old, done-to-death premise?  Is there a film school somewhere that teaches filmmakers with little skill and no imagination to keep pumping out these lame ""road trip to hell"" train wrecks?  Director Sean Dillon might be trying to pay homage to 70s drive-thru creature features with his grainy camera work - or he might just be using a cheap camera that gives everything a slightly grainy appearance (I'm going with the latter theory).  The viewer's only reward in the end (after an incredibly long ninety-plus minutes) is a surprise ending that Mr. Magoo could have seen coming from miles away.The summary says these are five college students, but I'm willing to bet none of them ever graced the halls of any school of higher education - and one of them would have to be in at least his 15th year of college, given how old he looks.  All I know for sure is that the three guys and two girls are all instantly unlikable.  They're also pretty much doomed after Bryan, the odd guy out, decides to take a cross-country shortcut through the middle of the freakin' desert.  After realizing they're hopelessly lost, they spot a shack and decide to approach it.  Personally, I would figure that any one stupid enough to live miles from anyone else in the middle of a desert probably isn't much for company, but, of course, I'm not a dumb character in a bad movie.  Actually, our desert survivor is glad to have the company of strangers - but only for a really bad reason.With their van out of commission, our characters find themselves fending off attack from some horrible monster after night falls.  We never actually get a good look at the monster, which is probably just as well, but we do see his handiwork.  The gore isn't very impressive, but the director likes to show it off, anyway.  Most of the movie, though, consists of the characters yelling at each other.  The acting isn't all that bad, really, but these actors never had a chance given the weak plot and lousy dialogue they were working with.  Who will live?  Who will die?  Who cares?",2,Yet another horribly cliched and downright annoying horror film,1306022400,"05 22, 2011",2011,2208,"['Five', 'annoying', 'young', 'people', 'road', 'trip', 'stranded', 'desert', 'prey', 'horrible', 'monster', 'yada', 'yada', 'Why', 'other', 'horror', 'director', 'keep', 'using', 'old', 'done-to-death', 'premise', 'there', 'film', 'school', 'somewhere', 'filmmakers', 'little', 'skill', 'imagination', 'keep', 'pumping', 'lame', 'road', 'trip', 'hell', 'train', 'wrecks', 'Director', 'Sean', 'Dillon', 'might', 'be', 'trying', 'pay', 'homage', '70s', 'drive-thru', 'creature', 'features', 'grainy', 'camera', 'work', 'might', 'just', 'be', 'using', 'cheap', 'camera', 'everything', 'slightly', 'grainy', 'appearance', ""'m"", 'going', 'latter', 'theory', 'viewer', 'only', 'reward', 'end', 'incredibly', 'long', 'ninety-plus', 'minutes', 'surprise', 'ending', 'Mr.', 'Magoo', 'could', 'have', 'seen', 'coming', 'miles', 'away.The', 'summary', 'are', 'five', 'college', 'students', ""'m"", 'willing', 'bet', 'none', 'ever', 'graced', 'halls', 'school', 'higher', 'education', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'least', '15th', 'year', 'college', 'given', 'how', 'old', 'know', 'sure', 'three', 'guys', 'two', 'girls', 'are', 'instantly', 'unlikable', ""'re"", 'also', 'pretty', 'much', 'doomed', 'Bryan', 'odd', 'guy', 'take', 'cross-country', 'shortcut', 'middle', 'freakin', 'desert', 'realizing', ""'re"", 'hopelessly', 'lost', 'spot', 'shack', 'decide', 'approach', 'Personally', 'would', 'figure', 'one', 'stupid', 'enough', 'live', 'miles', 'anyone', 'else', 'middle', 'desert', 'probably', ""n't"", 'much', 'company', 'course', ""'m"", 'not', 'dumb', 'character', 'bad', 'movie', 'Actually', 'desert', 'survivor', 'glad', 'have', 'company', 'strangers', 'only', 'really', 'bad', 'reason.With', 'van', 'commission', 'characters', 'find', 'fending', 'off', 'attack', 'horrible', 'monster', 'night', 'falls', 'never', 'actually', 'get', 'good', 'look', 'monster', 'probably', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'do', 'see', 'handiwork', 'gore', ""n't"", 'very', 'impressive', 'director', 'show', 'off', 'anyway', 'Most', 'movie', 'though', 'characters', 'yelling', 'other', 'acting', ""n't"", 'bad', 'really', 'actors', 'never', 'had', 'chance', 'given', 'weak', 'plot', 'lousy', 'dialogue', 'were', 'working', 'Who', 'will', 'live', 'Who', 'will', 'die', 'Who']",The Craving

This is much more like an abysmal soft core porn than anything else, and even at that - the simplest of all movies to make - it fails miserably. Also, if you are a fan of horror, even bad horror, this will disappoint you in every possible way. The plot is pointless and utterly without drama, the attempt at gore is laughably bad (and not in a good way). Hopefully the makers of this video won't get another job in the industry without issuing a formal apology for this train wreck.
