560394,A2I8L9LTD1LQHX,B00004YVEG,A. E Rothert,"[2, 7]","I was very much looking forward to watching this.  My parents had the brown covered, two albumn set of JCSS... and I long ago learned of (and viewed) the delightful 1973 film version.  It was dated the first time I saw it-- so much so that it seems less out of place now that retroing to the 70s is a respectable business.And then came along this one.Had I not seen the first film and never seen or heard JCSS performed, I would have adored this movie.  It has a good deal going for it.  The must, as always, rocks.  Renee Castle carrys off Mary Magdalene's tunes without a hitch.  Simon Zealotes, a character that has never stood out, for me, previously grabbed me in as performed by Tony Vincent.  I experience an eerie joy each time Jerome Pradon's Judas mocks JC.  The DVD also has a fun &quot;making of&quot;-- with Tim Rice and A.L.W. prominent throughout-- discussing with candor what they were (and were not) trying to accomplish.So, why three stars?  Most of the blame-- and blame is the correct word, since this film could have been great-- lies with Gelnn Carter as Jesus.  The shortest sentence in the bible, allegedly, is, &quot;Jesus wept.&quot;  You would not know it from watching Carter's Christ.  No, in this version: Jesus pouted.  Again and again.  The character of Jesus with his big pouty face (from the beginning when Judas questions Mary M. to the end when is whipped) hurt the film and detracted from its credibility.  (Perhaps if you watch on a small enough screen this would not be a problem.) I suspect that Carter is used to performing on stage and so he overdose it so that the backrow knows he is crying.  Unfortunately, the camera puts us in front of the front row, directly in front of his face, and he just looks silly.And then there is Herod.  I guess it is not really fair to be critical.  I doubt anyone will ever match Josh Mostel's Herod.  This Herod was okay.  But the scene has so much potential, it is disappointed to see it carried off only adequately.In short, if you are only going to see one, then stick with the 1973 version.  It is superior.  But there is a lot to enjoy on the DVD-- It is not a waste of time.",3,I wanted to like it... much more than I did,1024704000,"06 22, 2002",2002,2158,"['was', 'very', 'much', 'looking', 'forward', 'watching', 'parents', 'had', 'brown', 'covered', 'two', 'albumn', 'set', 'JCSS', 'long', 'ago', 'learned', 'viewed', 'delightful', '1973', 'film', 'version', 'was', 'dated', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'so', 'much', 'less', 'place', 'now', 'retroing', '70s', 'respectable', 'business.And', 'then', 'came', 'one.Had', 'not', 'seen', 'first', 'film', 'never', 'seen', 'heard', 'JCSS', 'performed', 'would', 'have', 'adored', 'movie', 'good', 'deal', 'going', 'must', 'always', 'rocks', 'Renee', 'Castle', 'carrys', 'off', 'Mary', 'Magdalene', 'tunes', 'hitch', 'Simon', 'Zealotes', 'character', 'never', 'stood', 'out', 'previously', 'grabbed', 'performed', 'Tony', 'Vincent', 'experience', 'eerie', 'joy', 'time', 'Jerome', 'Pradon', 'Judas', 'mocks', 'JC', 'DVD', 'also', 'fun', 'quot', 'making', 'quot', 'Tim', 'Rice', 'A.L.W', 'prominent', 'discussing', 'candor', 'what', 'were', 'were', 'not', 'trying', 'accomplish.So', 'why', 'three', 'stars', 'Most', 'blame', 'blame', 'correct', 'word', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'Gelnn', 'Carter', 'Jesus', 'shortest', 'sentence', 'bible', 'allegedly', 'quot', 'Jesus', 'wept.', 'quot', 'would', 'not', 'know', 'watching', 'Carter', 'Christ', 'No', 'version', 'Jesus', 'pouted', 'Again', 'again', 'character', 'Jesus', 'big', 'pouty', 'face', 'beginning', 'when', 'Judas', 'questions', 'Mary', 'M.', 'end', 'when', 'whipped', 'hurt', 'film', 'detracted', 'credibility', 'Perhaps', 'watch', 'small', 'enough', 'screen', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'problem', 'suspect', 'Carter', 'used', 'performing', 'stage', 'so', 'overdose', 'so', 'backrow', 'crying', 'Unfortunately', 'camera', 'front', 'front', 'row', 'directly', 'front', 'face', 'just', 'silly.And', 'then', 'Herod', 'guess', 'not', 'really', 'fair', 'be', 'critical', 'doubt', 'anyone', 'will', 'ever', 'match', 'Josh', 'Mostel', 'Herod', 'Herod', 'was', 'okay', 'scene', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'disappointed', 'see', 'carried', 'only', 'adequately.In', 'short', 'are', 'only', 'going', 'see', 'one', 'then', 'stick', '1973', 'version', 'superior', 'lot', 'enjoy', 'DVD', 'not', 'waste', 'time']",N/A
560395,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B00004YVEG,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[65, 68]","Filmed at Pinewood Studios, this production has sparse sets with scaffolding that serves for nearly every scene, and has the feel of a stage performance; it has been updated to an indeterminate era, but definitely a time one wouldn't want to live in. There are Nazi-like authority figures, punky gun-toting youth, and the walls are covered in graffiti. The colors are provided by the lighting, and are usually in either a monocromatic dark blue or yellow-orange.Inevitably, many people will compare this to the 1973 Norman Jewison film, which is a pity, as they are so vastly different. This is much more somber, and the final scenes are wrenching.Glenn Carter is astounding as Jesus, vocally exceptional in what must be a difficult part to sing, and looking like an Albrecht Durer painting. His Gethsemane (&quot;I Only Want to Say&quot;) is superb, and worth the price of this film alone.Jerome Pradon is also excellent as Judas, and Fred Johanson's Pilate is marvelous, though the entire cast is good, both as actors and singers.It is interesting in this film how skillfully the evil in a character is portrayed in the song and dance numbers, by Herod (who is so well played by Rik Mayall), and Judas.One feels the exhaustion and horror of Jesus' last days palpably in this film. The drama of the scourging is a magnificent piece of staging, and powerful; it is a visual punch to the gut, and the crucifixion scene is brilliantly done and moves me to tears every time I see it.Not an easy film to watch, but well worth the purchase, as it gets better with each viewing.",5,stark and dark,1074988800,"01 25, 2004",2004,1572,"['Filmed', 'Pinewood', 'Studios', 'production', 'sparse', 'sets', 'scaffolding', 'nearly', 'scene', 'feel', 'stage', 'performance', 'been', 'updated', 'indeterminate', 'era', 'definitely', 'time', 'one', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'live', 'are', 'Nazi-like', 'authority', 'figures', 'punky', 'gun-toting', 'youth', 'walls', 'are', 'covered', 'graffiti', 'colors', 'are', 'provided', 'lighting', 'are', 'usually', 'monocromatic', 'dark', 'blue', 'yellow-orange.Inevitably', 'many', 'people', 'will', 'compare', '1973', 'Norman', 'Jewison', 'film', 'pity', 'are', 'so', 'vastly', 'different', 'much', 'more', 'somber', 'final', 'scenes', 'are', 'wrenching.Glenn', 'Carter', 'astounding', 'Jesus', 'vocally', 'exceptional', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'difficult', 'part', 'sing', 'looking', 'Albrecht', 'Durer', 'painting', 'Gethsemane', 'quot', 'Only', 'Want', 'Say', 'quot', 'superb', 'price', 'film', 'alone.Jerome', 'Pradon', 'also', 'excellent', 'Judas', 'Fred', 'Johanson', 'Pilate', 'marvelous', 'entire', 'cast', 'good', 'actors', 'singers.It', 'interesting', 'film', 'how', 'skillfully', 'evil', 'character', 'portrayed', 'song', 'dance', 'numbers', 'Herod', 'who', 'so', 'well', 'played', 'Rik', 'Mayall', 'Judas.One', 'exhaustion', 'horror', 'Jesus', 'last', 'days', 'palpably', 'film', 'drama', 'scourging', 'magnificent', 'piece', 'staging', 'powerful', 'visual', 'punch', 'gut', 'crucifixion', 'scene', 'brilliantly', 'done', 'moves', 'tears', 'time', 'see', 'it.Not', 'easy', 'film', 'watch', 'well', 'purchase', 'better', 'viewing']",N/A

560397,A3M8H644ON5FQD,B00004YVEG,Amazon Customer,"[3, 11]","As a recent convert (no pun intended) to ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" fandom, I looked forward to the 2000 version with only slight reservation. Truth be told, the only real reservation I had was the knowledge that, unlike the 1973 motion picture, the 2000 version (based on a recent London stage revival) was shot entirely on video. That in mind, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that directors Gale Edwards and Nick Morris utilized clever cinematography to give the stage production a very cinematic feel. Unfortunately, that's about where the pleasant surprises ended for me. Apart from occasional standout performances delivered by supporting cast members, ""Jesus Christ Superstar 2000"" suffers seriously in comparison with its superlative 1973 predecessor. Glenn Carter (Jesus) and Jerome Pradon (Judas) have the difficult task of filling the incredibly big shoes of Ted Neeley and Carl Anderson in the original motion picture. Carter, who looks like he could be the possible offspring of Peter Fonda and the lead singer from that awful 80s hairspray band White Lion, has a fine voice which may have served him better if he'd attempted to find his own range rather than attempting to re-create Neeley's. Pradon has the most difficult job of the two, in my opinion, and although I give the man points for the guts it must have required to take on a role so brilliantly portrayed by Anderson in 1973, his chiseled good looks and powerful voice are simply not enough to make anyone forget the fact that somewhere in America, muddled in the obscurity of bit parts, there exists a 57-year-old man that rightfully should have become a superstar of stage and screen. Even the beautiful, vocally gifted Renee Castle (Mary Magdalene), despite her best efforts, pales in comparison with the genuinely moving and captivating performance of Yvonne Elliman as the original Magdalene. In addition the musical interpretations, although superior in sound quality to what you'll find on the dvd of the original motion picture, fall short. But it's not all bad news about ""Jesus Christ Superstar 2000"", for it succeeds wonderfully on one level: it makes you want to race out and buy yourself a copy of the original movie, which stands as one of the few motion picture musical masterpieces of the latter 20th century.",2,Incredibly big shoes to fill.,1030060800,"08 23, 2002",2002,2305,"['recent', 'convert', 'pun', 'intended', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'Superstar', 'fandom', 'looked', 'forward', '2000', 'version', 'only', 'slight', 'reservation', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'only', 'real', 'reservation', 'had', 'was', 'knowledge', '1973', 'motion', 'picture', '2000', 'version', 'based', 'recent', 'London', 'stage', 'revival', 'was', 'shot', 'entirely', 'video', 'mind', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'discover', 'directors', 'Gale', 'Edwards', 'Nick', 'Morris', 'utilized', 'clever', 'cinematography', 'give', 'stage', 'production', 'very', 'cinematic', 'feel', 'Unfortunately', 'where', 'pleasant', 'surprises', 'ended', 'Apart', 'occasional', 'standout', 'performances', 'delivered', 'supporting', 'cast', 'members', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'Superstar', '2000', 'suffers', 'seriously', 'comparison', 'superlative', '1973', 'predecessor', 'Glenn', 'Carter', 'Jesus', 'Jerome', 'Pradon', 'Judas', 'have', 'difficult', 'task', 'filling', 'incredibly', 'big', 'shoes', 'Ted', 'Neeley', 'Carl', 'Anderson', 'original', 'motion', 'picture', 'Carter', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'possible', 'offspring', 'Peter', 'Fonda', 'lead', 'singer', 'awful', '80s', 'hairspray', 'band', 'White', 'Lion', 'fine', 'voice', 'may', 'have', 'served', 'better', ""'d"", 'attempted', 'find', 'own', 'range', 'rather', 'attempting', 're-create', 'Neeley', 'Pradon', 'most', 'difficult', 'job', 'two', 'opinion', 'give', 'man', 'points', 'guts', 'must', 'have', 'required', 'take', 'role', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'portrayed', 'Anderson', '1973', 'chiseled', 'good', 'looks', 'powerful', 'voice', 'are', 'simply', 'not', 'enough', 'make', 'anyone', 'forget', 'fact', 'somewhere', 'America', 'muddled', 'obscurity', 'bit', 'parts', '57-year-old', 'man', 'rightfully', 'should', 'have', 'become', 'superstar', 'stage', 'screen', 'Even', 'beautiful', 'vocally', 'gifted', 'Renee', 'Castle', 'Mary', 'Magdalene', 'best', 'efforts', 'pales', 'comparison', 'genuinely', 'moving', 'captivating', 'performance', 'Yvonne', 'Elliman', 'original', 'Magdalene', 'addition', 'musical', 'interpretations', 'superior', 'sound', 'quality', 'what', ""'ll"", 'find', 'dvd', 'original', 'motion', 'picture', 'fall', 'short', 'not', 'bad', 'news', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'Superstar', '2000', 'wonderfully', 'one', 'level', 'want', 'race', 'buy', 'copy', 'original', 'movie', 'one', 'few', 'motion', 'picture', 'musical', 'masterpieces', 'latter', '20th', 'century']",N/A

This thing is out there for decades, and I'd expect the new versions get better, learning from the predecessors. Instead they get worse every time.  There was a fine version  with Ian Gillan in the beginning. Then the film version I found with voices less fitting on the LP. But much of that was compensated on the screen at least.Here we have voices MUCH WORSE than those early versions. And the play is mediocre too, at least at some very important parts.The staging itself I like.  The operator's work is excellent. And picture quality could get THX certification hands down.  And the look of the characters is used well too. The main roles still drag the whole feeling down.  Judas is pretty lame in the first part of the show. Later on he gets better. I like how he use his face, and it was cut in repetedly observing what happens to Jesus.Jesus is plain bad overall.  Singing performace bad to mediocre, acting perfoirmance just mediocre. Like one having absolutely no clue what to do with the role.  The central and most important song of JCSS, Getsemane clearly shows that. The central section is okey, but start and especially the ending shows the wrong spirit. Taht is unacceptable, after having the 1973 film showing how to do that well.The other roles are so-so too, Caifas' singing i sometimes odd in the first part, improving later. Annas pretty much rocks. Pilate is pale singing the dream, but is near good later, but can't do it to the end, the 'you innocent puppet' is played just bad.Mary's singing seems impossible to spoil, playing is generally okey, could be better too.My suggestion: watch it before buying.

Well, sort of. First of all, it's not neccesarily a faithfull live performance. The work of cameras, the edition, the need of presenting it ""like a movie"", take a little of that notion. And second, this is just another adaptation of the live play. Not the first, nor the last.Is it ejoyable for those who only know the '73 movie?. Well, I kinda liked it. My guess is that if you love the play, you'll like this DVD, because it's all about the songs and the play. But certainly, I cannot say that, as a whole, this DVD is better than the old movie.The ""modernized"" enviroment is intended, I guess, to give the play an ""updated"" feeling. JCS for the new generations. But the street looks of the stage, the grafittis, the Nazi/Darth Vader-like costumes of the authorities and guards, and other elements, compromise compatibility. I mean, the message of Jesus Christ is universal, but the time and place in which events took place were unique. More than updated, the historical facts look out of place.OK, maybe it's just a false impression. Some would argue that the '73 movie version had the same flaws, with, among other things, roman guards in jeans and construction helmets. But since the movie was filmed in locations close to the originals in place and looks, details like modern costumes were easier to overlook.Regarding the voices, most of the singers are wonderful. I was specially impressed by Tony Vincent (Simon), Fred Johanson (Pilate) (by the way, he sounds so much like the judge in The Trial, in Pink Floyd's The Wall), and Renee Castle (Mary Magdalene). But the leads...Jerome Pradon (Judas) has a good voice, but the problem is the way he sings. Too many breaks in his singing becomes anoying. And the scene of Judas' final moments is awful. He choses to be somewhere between singing and screaming, with poor results. It's a shame, because in some parts he shows that he has a great range and powerful voice, but he just choses not to use all of this potential most of the times. And he shares another problem with Glen Carter (Jesus). They rather did the high notes of the songs with an elevated soft voice, not a powerful one. That produces changes in the key of the songs that are not pleasant. And they share another problem: sometimes, they look unconfortable in front of the camera. Check for instance the Gethsemani scene. Finally I was completely disappointed with Rik Mayall's voice (Herod).Ok, I know I'm making an unfair judgement. After all, the singing in the '73 movie version was pre-recorded, and all the actors did was to lip-synch, and sure, they chose the better takes, so the margin of error was absent. But then again, I'm talking about things that will be noticeble by those who are ""used"" to that old version.But of course, not all is bad. The handling of lights and cameras is excellent. And a couple of scenes are very powerful and impressive, not only in performance, but also in a cinematic sense: the trial before Pilate, and the crucifixtion (the problem is that they are interrupted by the ""Superstar"" song performance, in which Judas and dancing exotic girls are singing around Jesus carrying the cross, a scene that is somewhat shocking  and was ""softened"" in the '73 version).In conclusion, if you are a fan of the old movie, and want to see or get this DVD, think of it as an alternate version, but not necessarily ""better"".",3,IF YOU ARE A FAN OF THE 1973 MOVIE,1084147200,"05 10, 2004",2004,3525,"['reason', 'got', 'new', 'DVD', 'JCS', 'i', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'play', 'performed', 'live', 'would', 'get', 'closer', '1973', 'movie', 'version', 'Well', 'sort', 'First', 'all', 'not', 'neccesarily', 'faithfull', 'live', 'performance', 'work', 'cameras', 'edition', 'need', 'presenting', 'movie', 'take', 'little', 'notion', 'second', 'just', 'adaptation', 'live', 'play', 'Not', 'first', 'last.Is', 'ejoyable', 'who', 'only', 'know', ""'73"", 'movie', 'Well', 'kinda', 'liked', 'My', 'guess', 'love', 'play', ""'ll"", 'like', 'DVD', 'songs', 'play', 'certainly', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'that', 'whole', 'DVD', 'better', 'old', 'movie.The', 'modernized', 'enviroment', 'intended', 'guess', 'give', 'play', 'updated', 'feeling', 'JCS', 'new', 'generations', 'street', 'looks', 'stage', 'grafittis', 'Nazi/Darth', 'Vader-like', 'costumes', 'authorities', 'guards', 'other', 'elements', 'compromise', 'compatibility', 'mean', 'message', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'universal', 'time', 'place', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'were', 'unique', 'More', 'updated', 'historical', 'facts', 'look', 'place.OK', 'maybe', 'just', 'false', 'impression', 'would', 'argue', ""'73"", 'movie', 'version', 'had', 'same', 'flaws', 'other', 'things', 'roman', 'guards', 'jeans', 'construction', 'helmets', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'locations', 'close', 'originals', 'place', 'details', 'modern', 'costumes', 'were', 'easier', 'overlook.Regarding', 'voices', 'most', 'singers', 'are', 'wonderful', 'was', 'specially', 'impressed', 'Tony', 'Vincent', 'Simon', 'Fred', 'Johanson', 'Pilate', 'way', 'so', 'much', 'judge', 'Trial', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'Wall', 'Renee', 'Castle', 'Mary', 'Magdalene', 'leads', 'Jerome', 'Pradon', 'Judas', 'good', 'voice', 'problem', 'way', 'Too', 'many', 'breaks', 'singing', 'anoying', 'scene', 'Judas', 'final', 'moments', 'awful', 'be', 'somewhere', 'singing', 'screaming', 'poor', 'results', 'shame', 'parts', 'great', 'range', 'powerful', 'voice', 'just', 'not', 'use', 'potential', 'most', 'times', 'shares', 'problem', 'Glen', 'Carter', 'Jesus', 'rather', 'did', 'high', 'notes', 'songs', 'elevated', 'soft', 'voice', 'not', 'powerful', 'one', 'changes', 'key', 'songs', 'are', 'not', 'pleasant', 'share', 'problem', 'sometimes', 'look', 'unconfortable', 'front', 'camera', 'Check', 'instance', 'Gethsemani', 'scene', 'Finally', 'was', 'completely', 'disappointed', 'Rik', 'Mayall', 'voice', 'Herod', '.Ok', 'know', ""'m"", 'making', 'unfair', 'judgement', 'singing', ""'73"", 'movie', 'version', 'was', 'pre-recorded', 'actors', 'did', 'was', 'lip-synch', 'sure', 'chose', 'better', 'margin', 'error', 'was', 'absent', 'then', 'again', ""'m"", 'talking', 'things', 'will', 'be', 'noticeble', 'who', 'are', 'used', 'old', 'version.But', 'course', 'not', 'bad', 'handling', 'lights', 'cameras', 'excellent', 'couple', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'powerful', 'impressive', 'not', 'only', 'performance', 'also', 'cinematic', 'sense', 'trial', 'Pilate', 'crucifixtion', 'problem', 'are', 'interrupted', 'Superstar', 'song', 'performance', 'Judas', 'dancing', 'exotic', 'girls', 'are', 'singing', 'Jesus', 'carrying', 'cross', 'scene', 'somewhat', 'shocking', 'was', 'softened', ""'73"", 'version', 'conclusion', 'are', 'fan', 'old', 'movie', 'want', 'see', 'get', 'DVD', 'think', 'alternate', 'version', 'not', 'necessarily', 'better']",N/A

Jerome Pradon, I have mixed feelings about him. His acting is the best in the film, but his voice is just not suited for the role of Judas. Rene Castle's Mary was pleasant. I had no problems with her. Pilate (actor's name escapes me) is one of the best, he's tough as nails and has a fantastic voice. Fred B. Owen as Ciaphas was rather disapointing. He has a wonderfully deep bass voice, but he doesn't seem able to maintain it. He doesn't look threatening either, rather like a big teddy bear. Michael Shaffer's Annas was brilliant. Michael has captured the character better than anyone else. Last and most certainly least, Rik Myal as Herod. He can't sing, is not funny, and is truely annoying.

Gale Edwards, the director and brains behind the film obviously doesn't have a clue about what real drama is, for she views it as clueless expressions on Glenn Carter's blanked face.  Speaking of which, Glenn Carter as Jesus Christ, has a great voice and a nice chiseled chin, but he plays the role with little emotional depth.  An example of this is in the &quot;Arrest,&quot; when Peter and the rest of the apostles say &quot;hang on lord we're gonna' fight for you,&quot; and he says &quot;stick to fishing for now on&quot; sweetly, without the sarcasm and irony that was intended.  There are no locations, so it is just a filmed play, with the same drab sets in almost every scene.  I wonder why they bothered filming this, when they could have just filmed a performance of the Broadway revival.  The 1973 film has a lot more thought and better performances.

It's full of the agonies of deep reflection, and the hope that human existence is not without some meaning. It's got jealousy, rivalry, hate, lust, greed, torture, fear, self-doubt, and, yes, all-out betrayal of the most brutal, blood-soaked kind. Yes, the story of a vacillating Jewish mystic who was the inspiration for a major religion is great, and this version of Andrew Lloyd Webber's still-controversial 1970's musical is my favorite of the many productions I've seen. Here a nice twist comes in and takes the form of the evolution of the set and characters, as we begin with pseudo-modern-looking performers and backgrounds, and gradually over the course of the next ninety minutes everything shifts to looking like some neo-post-modernist version of Jerusalem circa 30 CE. The excellent Glenn Carter in particular takes his version of Jesus from a man who'd garner nary a sideward glance on twenty-first-century streets, thru a vaguely Greek-looking Christ, to the full-fledged Jesus of Sunday School familiarity. The cast here, mixed in ethnicity and nationality, achieves a superb synthesis of purpose and meshes together as few groups of actors do, until these individuals convincingly weave together a story that is ancient and modern, timeless, universal, and as powerful now as it was at its first telling nineteen-hundred years ago.

560413,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B00004YVEG,Dennis Littrell,"[12, 14]","I saw this before seeing the 1973 Norman Jewison version and so I won't comment on that film here.  (If you like, you can see my review at the other Amazon page where I do make comparisons.)  This was in fact my first experience with Jesus Christ, Superstar, and I must say I was delighted, especially with the acting and the music.  Surely this is a different production than that which ran in London and on Broadway since Directors Gale Edwards and Nick Morris use close ups of the actors' faces to great advantage, something not possible on the stage.  Lost to the viewer, I suspect, might be the full range of movement and choreography.  Not lost is the music of Andrew Lloyd Webber, in particular the title song and the haunting, ironic ballad, &quot;I don't know how to love him.&quot;  When Mary Magdalene in the person of the velvety Renee Castle breaks into song our spirit is roused and our understanding of one of the ironies of Christianity heightened.  The lyric, &quot;He's only a man, and I've had so many men before...&quot; somehow brings to life the enigma that Jesus, God in the flesh, is to all of us.I recall when JCS was first performed a controversy arose about whether it was sacrilegious.  I don't know how that controversy played out, but I can see how some might be offended.  (Of course, I was not.)  This production, while not directly sensuous does depict a very human Jesus, clad in one scene only in a very scanty loincloth.  There is an emphasis on the blood that he shed, wiped from him onto the hands of us all, or, as some have complained, onto the hands of the Jews, who have been getting the bad rap for two thousand years.  And there is the question, first of all of making Jesus into a political &quot;superstar.&quot;  Yet, that too is irony, a dramatic irony that is a truth.  He is a superstar in this country and has been for a long time.  Whether he is also the son of God is another matter.  That is partially the point of this musical.  The fact that it is played out in a contemporary milieu really adds to its universal power since it is conceivable that such a religious transformation could happen here.One does wonder however about some of the costuming.  Why are the Romans in Nazi uniforms, recalling an earlier era, and why is Judas in a leather jacket, looking a little like Marlon Brando from The Wild One (1954) or perhaps John Travolta from Grease (1978)?  Perhaps what is suggested is a broader time era, say the entire mid twentieth century.I found myself comparing this to some other filmed musicals that arose during that same era, the sixties and seventies, West Side Story, Grease, and Hair, musicals that in some sense seemed to break with the pleasant tradition long established with, for example, Where's Charlie?, South Pacific, Oklahoma, etc.  In a sense these newer productions seemed out to shock the bourgeoisie as well as to entertain the burghers, to widen the parameters of the London/New York musical comedy tradition and to call on the audience to think.  Indeed some imagined that a revolution was in the making.  JCS in particular seemed to threaten the religious orthodoxy.  In retrospect, however, Hair seems more dated than shocking and West Side Story and Grease totally within the tradition of My Fair Lady and Damn Yankees.  Jesus Christ, Superstar now thirty years later also seems totally within that venerable tradition.Glenn Carter as Jesus was very good.  His combination of strength and vulnerability suited well the conception of a Jesus who believed he was sent to earth to die for our sins, a persona half God and half man.  True he seemed to lack somewhat in charisma, but in attempting such a part, who wouldn't?  J&eacute;rme Pradon as Judas also was excellent in a nicely balanced characterization.  When he too laments that he didn't &quot;know how to love him&quot; we know the truth of the very human trap he made for himself (although properly speaking, he was God's instrument).  Renee Castle as Mary Magdalene was expressive and sung beautifully; indeed she seemed the very embodiment of a woman in love with a man she cannot possess.  However there was something lacking not in her performance, but in the very conception of the part.  I felt the need for some rags and dirt and some real destitution.  Perhaps Mary Magdalene here is too sanitized, too pretty, too clean and too well behaved to be the real Mary Magdalene.My only real disappointment with this engrossing and thought-provoking entertainment was in not seeing a glorious resurrection of Jesus.  But in retrospect, I realize that would have detracted from the Rice/Webber conception of &quot;a man, like any other man.&quot;  I think they make a powerful point, because in the deepest religious sense, at least to my mind, we and Christ really are brothers, the immaculate made flesh.",5,"A redemptive, but secular Jesus",987465600,"04 17, 2001",2001,4854,"['saw', 'seeing', '1973', 'Norman',

I am one of the ""die hard"" fans that loved the screen version from the 70's, wearing out three VHS tapes of it.  This version, however, grabbed me by the throat and demanded my attention.  This latest version of JCS is no slouch by any means.  This latest version is modernized and updated for the modern times, and is far more gritty and realistic when compared with the 1970's version.The use of a stage as the main set of the video actually works quite well.  Costumes are spectacular, as is the camera and lighting work.  The story line is more clearly defined as an examination of the relationship between Jesus (Glenn Carter), Judas (Jerome Pradon), and Mary (Renee Castle), and the dynamics involved.  The Romans, particularly Pilate (Fred Johanson), are far more frightening characters, as is Herod (Rik Mayall).  The Romans are no longer portrayed as innocent bystanders in this version, and the Trial before Pilate is far more violent (Carter in reality is injured during the production of this scene).  While not anywhere near the violent level of ""The Passion of the Christ,"" you may wish to consider whether this one is appropriate for younger viewers.If you like the 1973 video version of JCS, you'll love this one.",5,Whoa !!!

560415,A1EZMV5DSWU8TU,B00004YVEG,Draconis Blackthorne,"[3, 5]","Not the original, but a new British take on this classic play. Herein, I feel the aethetics are more to the point, particularly demonstrated in the polarities between the followers of the nazarene, who are basically filthy egalitarian peasants, vandalizing walls, dressed in rags {& the apostles were tattooed with crosses on their shoulders}, & who are dispersed & disciplined by `Imperial Guard'-looking enforcers {whose helmets look like Darth Vader's}, whereas the elite rulers of the day, The Sanhedrin, are frocked in black leather trenchcoats, commanding from their darkened chambres, & wearing silver medallions - verily, they could even be called ""The Sanhedrin Grotto"" for the overall effect of their powerful presence.In this remarkable presentation, jesus is portrayed in plain `uniform' prole vestments, sans a beard - looking more like a portrayal of an angel Gabriel than a wandering jewish madman - although the character does demonstrate his self-destructive insanity, as typical of the nazarene myth.Judas Iscariot is decked in what can be seen as ""commie-punk"" attire, which goes along well with his communistic mentality - although again, he does appear to be a much more interesting character, & a much more groomed one. It seems, according to this version, the ""eviler"" you are, the cleaner & neater one is.So jesus disrupts the marketplace, which moved into the `holy temple' {which is quite a statement, considering the money-begging evangelists of the day}, which contained, among other things, a slot machine, voluptuous dancers, & jesus actually tosses a television set across the room. So you can see, there was much artistic liscence taken with this presentation.Another mentionable dynamic I observed was the undelying homosexual undertones between the two, as well as among the apostles themselves. The embraces were more to the intimate manner, particuarly seen when Judas disturbingly gives jesus the ""death kiss"", with just a bit too much lingering.Still more telling, jesus sings in a falsetto high, whereas Caiaphas is a deep bass baritone.One impressive scene transpired when the nazarene was being led away from the Garden of Gethsemene, phantom figures in black assailed him with ghostly pallor & flashlights - the women wore shawls & cloaks {a very gothic aesthetic}, whereas the men wore leather trenchcoats & fedoras - an overall LaVeyan look.Although probably the most impressive character was that of Pontius Pilate, who appeared in again, a black leather trenchcoat & general's hat, but armored in a muscular design  reminiscient of the Roman militia - an imposing figure emminating authority & Power, in a  solid 12 o' clock frame. He fiercely grills jesus while in the Roman court, & adresses the bloodthirsty crowd, who claim no other allegience except to that of Caesar. Tired of the problematic & pathetic nazarene, he sends him to be judged by Herod.Herod appears on the scene surrounded in his Las Vegas-ornamented environment, complete with bowtie, ragtime cane & showgirls,, who, after a comical musical repartee', sends him back to Pilate, who sends him to be flogged, crowned with thorns, & finally, crucified. Interestingly, while on the path of pain, dragging his misery cross up to Golgotha, Judas, who had previously hung himself before a crowd of enthusiasts, appears again, dancing about with fetishistic angels {angels never looked this `good'}, who adore him accordingly, & he actually blasphemously stands upon the cross, beneath which is the crawling nazarene, jiding him impishly.Mary Magdalene is played by a sexy young black girl, who arrays jesus with love & affection - the only `man' she ever loved. This originally caused some contension between Judas & she, despite her chosen profession.In the end, they all witness the suicidal masochist-demigod perish like a deranged common criminal - & that is where it ends. No fantasies of resurrection, no scriptures , no blindlight references, just the display of a tragic myth in all its morose, & torment-filled splendour.",3,King of the slaves,1116115200,"05 15, 2005",2005,4040,"['Not', 'original', 'new', 'British', 'take', 'classic', 'play', 'Herein', 'feel', 'aethetics', 'are', 'more', 'point', 'particularly', 'demonstrated', 'polarities', 'followers', 'nazarene', 'who', 'are', 'basically', 'filthy', 'egalitarian', 'peasants', 'vandalizing', 'walls', 'dressed', 'rags', 'apostles', 'were', 'tattooed', 'crosses', 'shoulders', 'who', 'are', 'dispersed', 'disciplined', 'Imperial', ""Guard'-looking"", 'enforcers', 'helmets', 'look', 'Darth', 'Vader', 'elite', 'rulers', 'day', 'Sanhedrin', 'are', 'frocked', 'black', 'leather', 'trenchcoats', 'commanding', 'darkened', 'chambres', 'wearing', 'silver', 'medallions', 'verily', 'could', 'even', 'be', 'called', 'Sanhedrin', 'Grotto', 'overall', 'effect', 'powerful', 'presence.In', 'remarkable', 'presentation', 'jesus', 'portrayed', 'plain', 'uniform', 'prole', 'vestments', 'beard', 'looking', 'more', 'portrayal', 'angel', 'Gabriel', 'wandering', 'jewish', 'madman', 'character', 'demonstrate', 'self-destructive', 'insanity', 'typical', 'nazarene', 'myth.Judas', 'Iscariot', 'decked', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'commie-punk', 'attire', 'along', 'well', 'communistic', 'mentality', 'again', 'appear', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'character', 'much', 'more', 'groomed', 'one', 'according', 'version', 'eviler', 'are', 'cleaner', 'neater', 'one', 'is.So', 'jesus', 'marketplace', 'moved', 'holy', 'temple', 'quite', 'statement', 'considering', 'money-begging', 'evangelists', 'day', 'contained', 'other', 'things', 'slot', 'machine', 'voluptuous', 'dancers', 'jesus', 'actually', 'television', 'set', 'room', 'can', 'see', 'was', 'much', 'artistic', 'liscence', 'taken', 'presentation.Another', 'mentionable', 'dynamic', 'observed', 'was', 'undelying', 'homosexual', 'undertones', 'two', 'as', 'well', 'apostles', 'embraces', 'were', 'more', 'intimate', 'manner', 'particuarly', 'seen', 'when', 'Judas', 'disturbingly', 'jesus', 'death', 'kiss', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'lingering.Still', 'more', 'telling', 'jesus', 'sings', 'falsetto', 'high', 'whereas', 'Caiaphas', 'deep', 'bass', 'baritone.One', 'impressive', 'scene', 'transpired', 'when', 'nazarene', 'was', 'being', 'led', 'away', 'Garden', 'Gethsemene', 'phantom', 'figures', 'black', 'assailed', 'ghostly', 'pallor', 'flashlights', 'women', 'wore', 'shawls', 'cloaks', 'very', 'gothic', 'aesthetic', 'men', 'wore', 'leather', 'trenchcoats', 'fedoras', 'overall', 'LaVeyan', 'look.Although', 'probably', 'most', 'impressive', 'character', 'was', 'Pontius', 'Pilate', 'who', 'appeared', 'again', 'black', 'leather', 'trenchcoat', 'general', 'hat', 'armored', 'muscular', 'design', 'reminiscient', 'Roman', 'militia', 'imposing', 'figure', 'emminating', 'authority', 'Power', 'solid', '12', 'o', 'clock', 'frame', 'fiercely', 'jesus', 'Roman', 'court', 'bloodthirsty', 'crowd', 'who', 'claim', 'other', 'allegience', 'Caesar', 'Tired', 'problematic', 'pathetic', 'nazarene', 'be', 'judged', 'Herod.Herod', 'scene', 'surrounded', 'Las', 'Vegas-ornamented', 'environment', 'complete', 'bowtie', 'ragtime', 'cane', 'showgirls', 'who', 'comical', 'musical', 'repartee', 'back', 'Pilate', 'who', 'be', 'flogged', 'crowned', 'thorns', 'finally', 'crucified', 'Interestingly', 'path', 'pain', 'dragging', 'misery', 'cross', 'Golgotha', 'Judas', 'who', 'had', 'previously', 'hung', 'crowd', 'enthusiasts', 'again', 'dancing', 'fetishistic', 'angels', 'angels', 'never', 'looked', 'good', 'who', 'adore', 'accordingly', 'actually', 'blasphemously', 'cross', 'beneath', 'crawling', 'nazarene', 'jiding', 'impishly.Mary', 'Magdalene', 'played', 'sexy', 'young', 'black', 'girl', 'who', 'jesus', 'love', 'affection', 'only', 'man', 'ever', 'loved', 'originally', 'caused', 'contension', 'Judas', 'chosen', 'end', 'witness', 'suicidal', 'masochist-demigod', 'perish', 'deranged', 'common', 'criminal', 'where', 'fantasies', 'resurrection', 'scriptures', 'blindlight', 'references', 'just', 'display', 'tragic', 'myth', 'morose', 'torment-filled', 'splendour']",N/A
560416,A3VQLTB724O77W,B00004YVEG,Dr. Christopher Coleman,"[0, 0]","This is a fabulous performance of a wonderful work, and I recommend it most highly.  The listener need not be a Christian or a pop/rock devotee to enjoy it--I have no particular ideological or aesthetic sympathies with its subject matter or style. (I am a devout agnostic/secular humanist and a composer of contemporary classical music, with little affinity to most pop music--and proud of it.)  It is simply a fine artistic statement, very moving, engrossing, and involving on many levels.Musically Andrew Lloyd Webber is at his finest.  There are a few unfortunately trivial moments (&quot;Gethsemane (I Only Want To Say)&quot; has some awfully uninspired and repetitious music, although dramatically it is one of the climaxes of the opera) but most of the music is sophisticated and engaging.  Usually thought of as a &quot;rock opera&quot;--and certainly the majority of the music is rock--Jesus Christ Superstar incorporates a wide stylistic palette, drawing on sources as diverse as Romantic symphonic music ca. 1890, Music Hall tunes of the 40's, and even a touch of the atonal and avant-garde.  (The crucifixion scene contains &quot;sound mass&quot; music reminiscent of Ligeti's works such as his Requiem, probably most well known to audiences as the &quot;monolith music&quot; from the movie 2001.)  This plethora of stylistic influences is matched by a subtle compositional technique--I am very impressed by the ease with which Webber writes in somewhat unusual meters like 5/4 and 7/4.  Clearly here is a man who studied his Brubeck, and the result (for example Pilate and Christ) is as natural and flowing as the rest of the music.  [Webber has made both this stylistic eclecticism and metric flexibility his hallmark, most successfully in Evita.]This production picks up Webber's eclecticism and brings it to the fore.  Rather than attempt historical accuracy (as if such a thing were possible in a rock opera based in biblical Jerusalem sung in English) a postmodernist approach is taken, with familiar symbols both real and fantasy thrown together in an asynchronous stew.  The costumes of the authorities, both Roman and Jewish, are fantasy, but there are clear references to fascist and particular Nazi paraphernalia, especially in Pontius Pilate's attire. Simon Zealotes is a Rambo-esque character and comes complete with machine guns and bandoleers. The apostles and disciples look rather like Jessie Jackson hoped his Rainbow Coalition would turn out. King Herod is a nightclub entertainer, and there are angels in PVC, reporters in fedoras, background singers in evening gowns, etc.  (When will we get the action figures, I wonder?)  And against this anachronistic explosion, Jesus remains garbed in a seemingly historically accurate linen robe.  That the whole is not just the Village People's stylist's psychotic episode is evident in the fact that it WORKS.  Removing any historical context, while it may upset some more conservative Christians, brings Jesus' story to life--makes it universal and conversely gives it personal meaning in a way that a more literal representation would not.  Likewise, conservative Christians may criticize the adaptations to the Gospels that Tim Rice has made (which other critics here have already enumerated), but they are very effective.  That Jesus' doubts and fears almost overwhelm him in the garden of Gethsemane makes him human, and thus one of us.  Dramatizing what is recorded in the Gospels to enhance this seems completely appropriate, and making Pontius Pilate torture himself as well as Jesus has similar results.  Without doubt, without fear, Jesus would become like Superman, impervious to mortal harm; and thus his sacrifice would become meaningless.  That Pilate and Judas struggle with their own decisions, and are unable to comprehend Jesus' message is vital to recognizing them as ourselves, and certainly much of the drama of the story would be lost without this gloss.  Pilate's decision is every bit as climactic as Jesus' acceptance of his fate at Gethsemane, if not more so; and it is, in fact, the decision we make all too often.  Most of us won't be nailed to crosses, but we will be forced to make decisions that we know are morally wrong but which are popular nonetheless.In addition to the music and dramatization, the performances are well worthy of note.  In particular Glenn Carter as Jesus, Jerome Pradon as Judas, and Michael Shaeffer as Annas are a trio of amazing tenors.  They are not operatic, like Pavarotti, Domingo, and Carreras; but they have stunning voices and I hope to hear more.  Frederick B. Owens's Caiaphas is a profound and gorgeous bass, and Fred Johanson as Pontius Pilate came very close to stealing the show.  My only criticism of the performances was the over-frequent use of speaking or shouting a word or phrase for emphasis in something that was otherwise entirely sung.  Occasionally this can be effective (as in the original LP recording), but when Herod and Pilate do it repeatedly it loses its effect and destroys the melodic sense of the song.  Likewise, I was very disappointed that Christ shouts his last word, &quot;Into Your hands I commend my SPIRIT!&quot;--it absolutely destroyed the dramatic sense of the moment and seemed wildly inappropriate, although I do understand the impulse.Nonetheless, these criticisms are minor indeed, and this DVD of Jesus Christ Superstar is well worth the price.

560417,A3ORWAR4CAOPAC,B00004YVEG,DRob,"[9, 11]","First let me say that comparing this to the Norman Jewison 70's movie version is like comparing apples and oranges. The staging of this movie is completely different from the original, as is the feeling- it is a much darker version and gives a much more chilling feel of the political factors in place during the time of Jesus. It is also much more violent and graphic in its depiction of the torture and crucifiction of Jesus.That being said, I enjoyed this every bit as much as I enjoyed the 70's movie and the original concept albumn, although for completely different reasons. Jerome Pradon as Judas is absolutely incredible and manages the extremely difficult job of turning Judas into a character we like and have sympathy for. He and Glen Carter do an excellent job of showing the depth of their relationship; it is clear that both of them are wrapped up in something over which they have no control.Renee Castle as Mary Magdalene has an amazing voice and completely upstages the terrible portrayal by Yvonne Elliman in the 70's movie. She and Calvin Cornwall as Peter sing a haunting version of a song missing from the 70's movie and the concept albumn, ""Can We Start Again Please?"" This movie shows the shock and helplessness felt by the apostles.Rik Mayall's interpretation of Herod as a Las Vegas-style performer is brilliant, and is later recalled during Pradon's performance of Jesus Christ Superstar.A discordant note for me was Fred Johanson as Pilate- he bellows out his songs but is just not convincing as the Roman regent who is also swept up in something beyond his control.My first thought on watching Glen Carter's protrayal was that he is a mighty touchy-feeley Jesus. The more often I watch the film, the more annoyed I get by the way he constantly tosses his hair around and remains ever conscious of his role as a martyr.My family and I like to speculate on our dream cast for Jesus Christ Superstar. We would definitely take the Mary Magdalene, Judas and Peter from this movie and Barry Dennem's Pilate from the 70's movie. We are undecided as to which Herod we would use, Rik Marall or Josh Mostel, but we run into a real problem when trying to pick our favorite Jesus. The jury is still out on that one as far as I'm concerned-- if only Glenn Carter weren't quite so vain and Tim Neeley weren't quite so wimpy.However, the strong performances of the other actors for the most part make up for my annoyance with Carter. Is this movie better than the 70's version? No. Just different. They seem like completely different musicals.

I had to have it specially ordered because the store I went to did not have it in stock. And yes, it was worth it.To those of you unfamiliar with the plot of Jesus Christ Superstar (JCS), well... that sounds quite implausible, but still... if you have no idea what the story of Jesus Christ is, all you have to do is read the Bible, or head out to watch Passion of the Christ. JCS chronicles the last few days, or perhaps hours of Jesus of Nazareth's life, through the point of view of the betrayer, Judas Iscariot.Yes, this is what makes the storyline somewhat distinct from other movies/plays based on the story of Jesus. Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical sees Jesus through the eyes of Judas, and explores Judas's character, while at the same time, helping the audience to speculate why Judas would betray someone he loved so much.The cast here is outstanding. Glenn Carter is superb as Jesus, partly because he bears some resemblance to his character. Renee Castle is a great singer, though her voice is a little feeble and is reminiscent of Brandy. Jerome Pradon gets the thumbs-up for his performance as Judas. His interpretation of Judas's character shows us a man who is torn between his love for Jesus and his wisdom. Although Jerome is hardly a great singer, he is an outstanding actor. And his great performance is what makes the film so enjoyable. Rik Mayall is wonderful as King Herod. He has the right mischievous air, coupled with the malice he exudes.Indeed, it is the cast that holds this performance together. The musical itself, to me, is hardly as strong as what Andrew Lloyd Webber could have offered. The music has not enough lilts to engross viewers. I would not classify this musical as one of the greatest in the world for this reason.

The lighting, costumes and camerawork were well done.

In order for musicals to be entertaining, they must have all of the following: hard-rock scores, overly dramatic expressions, bright costumes (all leather, just so people can pay attention to the characters), gyrating hips, and thongs. We must have thongs in order to sit through these musicals.As a Jesus Christ Superstar fan, this version was a huge disappointment. However, I've never seen the play performed, and frankly, I don't want to. There isn't a stage director who can pull off a decent production of this dated play. So if you can't make it good, make it cool to the majority of the idiots who watch movies.As soon as the movie started, I was disappointed. I don't want to see it in a modern-day setting. I don't like the modern score. I want to see hippies prancing around in the desert, dammit! I grew up listening to the original concept recording and saw the Norman Jewison film many times. That's what I want to see! I don't want to see Roman guards who are dressed like comic book villians. I don't want the high priests to look like aliens. I don't want the ""Pilate's Dream"" scene to look like porn! WHY?!In addition to the poor ""modern"" adaptation, this version is plagued with horrific acting. Renee Castle is pretty good...she could carry the whole production. Jerome Pradon as Judas is crap. His portrayal of Judas as Jerusalem's bully is ridiculous, overdramatic, and unconvincing. However, when he begins to sing, he seems whiney. I kept trying to figure out what he was attempting to do; when he performed ""Damned For All Time,"" he kept running all over the place, and I kept thinking, ""Why???""Caiaphas kept looking like Mr. T to me, and I was expecting him to sing, ""I pity the fool who loves Jesus!"" at any time. His group of high priests walked around looking like some kind of gang. The actor who played Pilate looked like he only got the part because he can sing and has played villians. He makes you wonder how such an evil looking person came into power in the first place.The apostles all dressed in Abercrombie-like clothes and acted so happy and joyful around each other. ""Hey, it's Jesus. Let's all hug each other and smile and honor him now."" It did seem logical during the Last Supper like all of Jesus's words were way over their heads.When the comic relief (the intended comic relief, at least) finally comes in as Herod, played by Drop Dead Fred himself (Rik Mayall). It could have been a good sequence if Mayall acting completely off-base with his audio...is it that hard to lip sync to your own voice?""Could We Start Again Please,"" my favorite song, also could have been a good sequence, if it wasn't mixed with a beating of Jesus. It wasn't upsetting at all...it was too dramatic and filled with slow motion shots of Jesus being thrown around between a group of what looked like stormtroopers.When the time for ""Supestar"" to be performed, I was so ready for it to be over. And it looked like a cross between a really bad music video and a Victoria's Secret commercial. I think it was supposed to be disturbing, but wasn't effective at all.And then Jesus was crucified, and it was again trying to be shocking and disturbing. It could have been, if all of the actors weren't stretching their faces in ""grief"". Overall, the actors looked like they had just left an acting workshop and wanted to try out their new methods. If this is the type of acting they teach, it's surprising there isn't more worthless crap floating around out there. If you're interesting in seeing a good version of the play, see the Norman Jewison film.

I instantly fell in love with the original cast concept recording (Ian Gillan, Murray Head) and loved every minute of it. I had seen the original 70's movie and was a little disapointed. The sound quality was terrible and Ted Neeley (Jesus) had an annoying voice that he hardly ever took risks with. So when a firend told me that another one was out, naturally I was jazzed to see it. When I first saw it, I thought it was good but not great. I mean, I thought others could have pulled off the same thing better. But then I started watching it again and again and I realized how brilliant it was. It was absolutely marvelous. I mean, every single character is wonderfully placed! At first I thought that Judas had a bad voice and Zubin Varla (played Judas in 1996) would have done better. But as I listened, Varla always seemed mad in the recording. Jerome Pradon pulls off the character of Judas brilliantly. I think his acting pays off greatly as apposed to his singing. I aslo thought Glenn Carter was weak. But as I watched again and again, he is absolutely marvelous in that he captures what I think Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice wanted out of Jesus.

I had found the dusty desert with little to no staging from the 70's version a little unnerving.  In addition to the background, some of the vocal ranges were, shall we say, unusual - of course, blame Webber and Rice for this, I guess.  After time, though, the voices of Jesus and Judas simply won me over.  Judas was phenomenal.  Anyway, I was anxious to try the new.I was a little disappointed after seeing the production.  I say a ""little"" because I tried really hard to appreciate the novelty.  But after repeated viewings, all I can say is that I personally feel this production is horrible.The 70's Jesus was so small and frail it was troubling at first.  Ultimately his powerful voice and raw emotion won me over.  This Jesus never could win me over.  He seemed weak and was pushed around - literally (not by the Pharisees or Romans as you'd expect, but by Judas).  And speaking of Judas... Poor fellow.  Poor, poor Judas.  He absolutley cannot reach the notes.  I am sure he has a good voice, but most of what is heard here is the poor guy straining for all he's worth.  He is emotive, but I think that may be the head rush from clinching every muscle he has to try to hit the notes.I do believe the pharisees were better in the new production - even if some of their acting was a little disconcerting.  The disciples were pretty pathetic in my opinion.  Mary was okay.I had hoped the staging would be a welcome change form the old version, but I just didn't feel it fit the piece.  I could never buy in.Obviously many disagree, but my earnest suggestion is that you stick with the standard edition from the 70's if you want JCS.  With the sparse production value, you can focus on the talent of the actors.  The new version has nothing to offer - in worthwhile staging or vocal talent.",2,Go for the 70's version...,1101859200,"12 1, 2004",2004,1878,"['When', 'had', 'opportunity', 'see', 'reworked', 'JCS', 'was', 'eager', 'take', 'advantage', 'had', 'found', 'dusty', 'desert', 'little', 'staging', '70', 'version', 'little', 'unnerving', 'addition', 'background', 'vocal', 'ranges', 'were', 'shall', 'say', 'unusual', 'course', 'blame', 'Webber', 'Rice', 'guess', 'time', 'though', 'voices', 'Jesus', 'Judas', 'simply', 'won', 'over', 'Judas', 'was', 'phenomenal', 'Anyway', 'was', 'anxious', 'try', 'new.I', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'seeing', 'production', 'say', 'little', 'tried', 'really', 'hard', 'appreciate', 'novelty', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'can', 'say', 'personally', 'feel', 'production', 'horrible.The', '70', 'Jesus', 'was', 'so', 'small', 'frail', 'was', 'troubling', 'first', 'Ultimately', 'powerful', 'voice', 'raw', 'emotion', 'won', 'over', 'Jesus', 'never', 'could', 'win', 'seemed', 'weak', 'was', 'pushed', 'literally', 'not', 'Pharisees', 'Romans', ""'d"", 'expect', 'Judas', 'speaking', 'Judas', 'Poor', 'fellow', 'Poor', 'poor', 'Judas', 'absolutley', 'can', 'not', 'reach', 'notes', 'am', 'sure', 'good', 'voice', 'most', 'what', 'heard', 'here', 'poor', 'guy', 'straining', 'worth', 'emotive', 'think', 'may', 'be', 'head', 'rush', 'clinching', 'muscle', 'try', 'hit', 'notes.I', 'do', 'believe', 'pharisees', 'were', 'better', 'new', 'production', 'even', 'acting', 'was', 'little', 'disconcerting', 'disciples', 'were', 'pretty', 'pathetic', 'opinion', 'Mary', 'was', 'okay.I', 'had', 'hoped', 'staging', 'would', 'be', 'welcome', 'change', 'form', 'old', 'version', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'fit', 'piece', 'could', 'never', 'buy', 'in.Obviously', 'many', 'disagree', 'earnest', 'suggestion', 'stick', 'standard', 'edition', '70', 'want', 'JCS', 'sparse', 'production', 'value', 'can', 'focus', 'talent', 'actors', 'new', 'version', 'nothing', 'offer', 'worthwhile', 'staging', 'vocal', 'talent']",N/A

As a Christian believer, I find it very difficult to appreciate ALW's treatment of a character who is for many a religious icon, and for a few of us, something far more.

Superstar does an excellent job at conveying the sense of menace, the emotional highs and lows of the events it depicts, and of exploring the political- and psychological- mechinations which brought them about. There are some powerful and dramatic scenes (Trial Before Pilate and the 39 Lashes), and rare moments when Lloyd Webber actually gets it very nearly right (Could We Start Again Please?).

Airhart ""smartThingie""","[0, 0]","Visually and musically stunning, this stage-acted production of JCS seems less a re-imagination than a refitting of the original in contemporary high fashion and music video.Comparing this production to the 1973 movie is, in some ways, like comparing apples to oranges: The acting in a stage production will always differ substantially from the same roles acted in a movie, the former being inherently melodramatic to reach a theater audience, and the latter being subdued for the cameras (and refined through multiple retakes of a scene).Adorned in pricey attire, beautifully lit, buff and moisturized, the cast of this JCS is reminiscent of Details Magazine or Abercrombie ads: Uniformly attractive and, due to their spotless appearance, artificial. Many fans of the original JCS (including me) may find this Madison Avenue version of modernity unrealistic and contrary to the poverty and rugged living conditions of Jesus' times as well as the present-day Middle East. But the intent of this production was to make JCS ultra-contemporary for a post-MTV generation. Thanks to minimalist set design and excellent photography, the ultra-contemporary concept is well-executed.The script, songs and timing of the new JCS closely follow the original with little noticeable variation. And like the original production, this one lacks rootedness in the Jewish faith of Jesus and his followers -- but then, so do most productions about Jesus.One big break with the 1973 movie is in setting: The original movie was set in gritty, desolate Holy Land locations. The new movie is set in a clean, expensive-looking, post-modern urban plaza that lacks historical context.Another break: Jerome Pradon's courageous and vulnerable (if sometimes melodramatic) new take on an insecure and emotionally wounded Judas.Glenn Carter is satisfactory as Jesus, especially at crucifixion, though at times his performance (like his fellow cast members) is too smooth, glamorous, and ""theatrical"" for such emotionally and physically traumatic circumstances.Like its predecessors, this production forfeited the opportunity to connect JCS to historical or present-day politics of religious hypocrisy and occupation -- forces that prompted the crucifixion. Jesus' persecutors are instead portrayed as fictitious Goth fascist egotists with no plausible real-world equivalent.I give this movie three-and-a-half stars for its dazzling production values, music, casting, and execution of a concept: Jesus of Nazareth meets contemporary fashion and personal expression.I subtract a star-and-a-half for overemphasis on fashion, absence of religious and political context, and performances that try a little TOO hard (at times) to be theatrical.",4,Jesus meets GQ,1202342400,"02 7, 2008",2008,2708,"['Visually', 'musically', 'stunning', 'stage-acted', 'production', 'JCS', 'less', 're-imagination', 'refitting', 'original', 'contemporary', 'high', 'fashion', 'music', 'video.Comparing', 'production', '1973', 'movie', 'ways', 'comparing', 'apples', 'oranges', 'acting', 'stage', 'production', 'will', 'always', 'differ', 'substantially', 'same', 'roles', 'acted', 'movie', 'former', 'being', 'inherently', 'melodramatic', 'reach', 'theater', 'audience', 'latter', 'being', 'subdued', 'cameras', 'refined', 'multiple', 'retakes', 'scene', '.Adorned', 'pricey', 'attire', 'beautifully', 'lit', 'buff', 'moisturized', 'cast', 'JCS', 'reminiscent', 'Details', 'Magazine', 'Abercrombie', 'ads', 'Uniformly', 'attractive', 'due', 'spotless', 'appearance', 'artificial', 'Many', 'fans', 'original', 'JCS', 'including', 'may', 'find', 'Madison', 'Avenue', 'version', 'modernity', 'unrealistic', 'contrary', 'poverty', 'rugged', 'living', 'conditions', 'Jesus', 'times', 'as', 'well', 'present-day', 'Middle', 'East', 'intent', 'production', 'was', 'make', 'JCS', 'ultra-contemporary', 'post-MTV', 'generation', 'Thanks', 'minimalist', 'set', 'design', 'excellent', 'photography', 'ultra-contemporary', 'concept', 'well-executed.The', 'script', 'songs', 'timing', 'new', 'JCS', 'closely', 'follow', 'original', 'little', 'noticeable', 'variation', 'original', 'production', 'one', 'rootedness', 'Jewish', 'faith', 'Jesus', 'followers', 'then', 'so', 'do', 'most', 'productions', 'Jesus.One', 'big', 'break', '1973', 'movie', 'setting', 'original', 'movie', 'was', 'set', 'gritty', 'desolate', 'Holy', 'Land', 'locations', 'new', 'movie', 'set', 'clean', 'expensive-looking', 'post-modern', 'urban', 'plaza', 'historical', 'context.Another', 'break', 'Jerome', 'Pradon', 'courageous', 'vulnerable', 'sometimes', 'melodramatic', 'new', 'take', 'insecure', 'emotionally', 'wounded', 'Judas.Glenn', 'Carter', 'satisfactory', 'Jesus', 'especially', 'crucifixion', 'though', 'times', 'performance', 'fellow', 'cast', 'members', 'too', 'smooth', 'glamorous', 'theatrical', 'such', 'emotionally', 'physically', 'traumatic', 'circumstances.Like', 'predecessors', 'production', 'forfeited', 'opportunity', 'connect', 'JCS', 'historical', 'present-day', 'politics', 'religious', 'hypocrisy', 'occupation', 'forces', 'prompted', 'crucifixion', 'Jesus', 'persecutors', 'are', 'instead', 'portrayed', 'fictitious', 'Goth', 'fascist', 'egotists', 'plausible', 'real-world', 'equivalent.I', 'give', 'movie', 'three-and-a-half', 'stars', 'dazzling', 'production', 'values', 'music', 'casting', 'execution', 'concept', 'Jesus', 'Nazareth', 'meets', 'contemporary', 'fashion', 'personal', 'expression.I', 'subtract', 'star-and-a-half', 'overemphasis', 'fashion', 'absence', 'religious', 'political', 'context', 'performances', 'try', 'little', 'TOO', 'hard', 'times', 'be', 'theatrical']",N/A

I have watched the 73 version a minimum of 100 times. I'm not a religious person, but rather a fan of the modern musicals.Well, as I'm typing this review I am about half way through this version. I must say can not compare the two. Not only are the sets and the period it is set in different but the actors have totally reinvented the film. Every word and note is the same in both versions they are two completely different films. The actors but a whole new emphasis on the way you feel.Glen Carter IS NOT Ted Neely and I am glad for it. I can honestly say that liking one version will not take away from the other. In all the remakes of films I have seen over the years I am immensely impressed at these two films.  Now my biggest problem will be which one will I watch when I feel the mood to see this tale again next time.One point of comparison though if I may....1) the vocal performance of Ted Neely in Gethsemane cannot be matched but Glen Carter does a close job of it.In the 73 version there was a controversy by casting a black man as Judas but now as it really was then race was not part of the casting but rather the talent was.Well, after YEARS of putting off watching this film I am glad I finally did.",5,WOW!!!!!!!!!,1261353600,"12 21, 2009",2009,1363,"['am', 'big', 'fan', '1973', 'version', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'SuperstarJesus', 'Christ', 'Superstar', 'Special', 'Edition', 'was', 'afraid', 'even', 'watch', 'one', 'have', 'watched', '73', 'version', 'minimum', '100', 'times', ""'m"", 'not', 'religious', 'person', 'rather', 'fan', 'modern', 'musicals.Well', ""'m"", 'typing', 'review', 'am', 'half', 'way', 'version', 'must', 'say', 'can', 'not', 'compare', 'two', 'Not', 'only', 'are', 'sets', 'period', 'set', 'different', 'actors', 'have', 'totally', 'reinvented', 'film', 'word', 'note', 'same', 'versions', 'are', 'two', 'completely', 'different', 'films', 'actors', 'whole', 'new', 'emphasis', 'way', 'feel.Glen', 'Carter', 'IS', 'NOT', 'Ted', 'Neely', 'am', 'glad', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'liking', 'one', 'version', 'will', 'not', 'take', 'away', 'other', 'remakes', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'years', 'am', 'immensely', 'impressed', 'two', 'films', 'Now', 'biggest', 'problem', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'will', 'watch', 'when', 'feel', 'mood', 'see', 'tale', 'again', 'next', 'time.One', 'point', 'comparison', 'may', '.1', 'vocal', 'performance', 'Ted', 'Neely', 'Gethsemane', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'matched', 'Glen', 'Carter', 'close', 'job', 'it.In', '73', 'version', 'there', 'was', 'controversy', 'casting', 'black', 'man', 'Judas', 'now', 'really', 'was', 'then', 'race', 'was', 'not', 'part', 'casting', 'rather', 'talent', 'was.Well', 'YEARS', 'putting', 'off', 'watching', 'film', 'am', 'glad', 'finally', 'did']",N/A

You want to know if THIS version is worthy, and I say oh HELL yeah!  Let me state up front ( so I don't have to keep repeating myself) that I love the 1973 Norman Jewison film, (JC73 from here on)  and think it sets an incredibly high bar, that few rock musicals have ever reached. Jesus Christ Superstar 2001  (JC2K1 from here on) not only reaches the bar, but demolishes it.  It's not without it's problems, however.Where JC73 is broad and cinematic, JC2K1 is tight, small, and theatrical, sometimes to the point of being claustrophobic. The problem with a theatrical production brought to film, is that when you have to pitch to the ""back of the house"", it can look melodramatic in close-up.  JC2K1 crosses that line a number of times. OTOH, there are times when the closeness and intimacy of this production are mesmerizing.Let's get to the actor smack-down, shall we?JESUS:  Glenn Carter is good, but I think Ted Neely owns this role.  Carter arguably has the stronger voice, but his performance stays stuck on ""angry and frustrated"".  Neely gives a much more subtle, restrained performance, that Ithink more accurately depicts how Jesus must have felt in the final week. TED NEELY. (JC73)JUDAS: I don't want to say a word against Carl Anderson from JC73, he is amazing.  But Jerome Pradon absolutely sold me on his performance.  Pradon definitely has the weaker voice, but his performance is so damned (literally) amazing that he now is Judas for me, forever.  JEROME PRADON. (JC2K1)MARY MAGDALENE: No question at all.  Renee Castle is the best Mary I've ever seen, live or film. You can hear her heart bleed, with pitch-perfect passion.  I don't think anyone has done this crucial and difficult role better. RENEE CASTLE (JC2K1)PONTIUS PILATE: My biggest dissapointment, by far, in this production.  Fred Johanson comes across as a melodramiatic ""Snydley Whiplash"" rather than the multi-layered, anguished mess that Barry Dennen portrayed so brilliantly. BARRY DENNEN (JC73)HEROD: My toughest call. Josh Mostel is delicious in JC73, portraying the grossness, decadence, and fun of evil.  Rik Mayall does an equally delicious job in JC2K1, but puts a very different spin on it, highlighting the scariness of decadence.  CAN'T CALL, I LOVE THEM BOTH.THE APOSTLES: Another no-brainer.  In JC73 the apostles were fairly anonymous bit parts, necessary to move the story and songs along, but otherwise forgettable. In JC2K1, Simon, Peter, and James POP!  They take relatively minor parts, and breathe new life into them, without distracting from the main story. JC2K1.CONCLUSION: I love Jesus Christ Superstar. It's one of my favorite musicals (and I'm a musical buff)  I've listened to the Broadway and London recordings hundreds of times, seen it on stage 5 times (twice in San Francisco), and watched both film versions at least 20 times each.  JC2K1,Jesus Christ Superstaris the version that consistently takes my breath away.  Despite a few individual performances where I would argue that I've seen better, and a few times where the filming seems both melodramatic and claustrophobic, overall, this version works at a level that few movie musicals have touched.Andrew Lloyd Webber is quoted as saying ""This is the version I've waited 30 years to see"".If you care for the musical at all, you simply have to give this a chance.

Of course, singing was well orchestrated and the sound is as hip as the sound of today's genre. The version from the classic movie was given new life and new twist to the rhythm and essence of the songs rendered but I have to say that the original one will always be the best because the gems are still there and you really are used to listening to it.In fairness to this modern version, a breakthrough film making was done giving a 'live' portraits of a broadway, in terms of cinematography and acting performances of the stars. Although the actors of this version are full of intensity and emotion, there are some instances that they overdo their emotions which is not appropiate anymore to their lines that they were saying or singing...just observed the scene where Judas and Mary Magdalene confrontation and the intervention of Jesus and also the Last Supper...you will be the critic of this.Over all, the film has done some adjustments and giving new twist to the classic broadway hit but at the end the viewers will decide which version favored to their taste after all, 'Jesus Christ Superstar' is a movie where anybody and everybody can relate to it...just be an open-minded person, that's the imprtant attitude to watch this film.",4,A Brand New Twist,1078876800,"03 10, 2004",2004,1601,"['i', 'have', 'seen', 'classic', 'version', ""'Jesus"", 'Christ', 'Superstar', 'one', 'interest', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'comparing', 'classic', 'modern', 'version', 'hit', 'broadway', 'turned', 'movie', 'spectacle', 'classic', 'one', 'more', 'fast', 'pace', 'scenes', 'are', 'full', 'intensity', 'colors', 'are', 'vibrant', 'singing', 'full', 'swing', 'course', 'singing', 'was', 'well', 'orchestrated', 'sound', 'as', 'hip', 'sound', 'today', 'genre', 'version', 'classic', 'movie', 'was', 'given', 'new', 'life', 'new', 'twist', 'rhythm', 'essence', 'songs', 'rendered', 'have', 'say', 'original', 'one', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'best', 'gems', 'are', 'still', 'there', 'really', 'are', 'used', 'listening', 'it.In', 'fairness', 'modern', 'version', 'breakthrough', 'film', 'making', 'was', 'done', 'giving', ""'live"", 'portraits', 'broadway', 'terms', 'cinematography', 'acting', 'performances', 'stars', 'actors', 'version', 'are', 'full', 'intensity', 'emotion', 'are', 'instances', 'overdo', 'emotions', 'not', 'appropiate', 'anymore', 'lines', 'were', 'saying', 'singing', 'just', 'observed', 'scene', 'where', 'Judas', 'Mary', 'Magdalene', 'confrontation', 'intervention', 'Jesus', 'also', 'Last', 'Supper', 'will', 'be', 'critic', 'this.Over', 'film', 'done', 'adjustments', 'giving', 'new', 'twist', 'classic', 'broadway', 'hit', 'end', 'viewers', 'will', 'decide', 'version', 'favored', 'taste', 'Christ', 'Superstar', 'movie', 'where', 'anybody', 'everybody', 'can', 'relate', 'just', 'be', 'open-minded', 'person', 'imprtant', 'attitude', 'watch', 'film']",N/A

Judas's betrayal of Christ in the New Testament for pieces of silver has never made much sense to me, especially in light of Judas's subsequent suicide, which suggests money was not the real object.  But in THIS version, Judas's betrayal of Christ makes perfect sense.  Judas is presented as a closet queen who is unable to face his homosexual attraction to Jesus, which certainly gives Judas's reprise of &quot;I Don't Know How to Love Him&quot; new painful meaning and explains a certain jealous animosity toward Mary Magdalene, whom he rightfully regards as a rival.  Needless to say, the &quot;kiss of Judas&quot; is given a new interpretation here as well.  When Judas realizes that his betrayal of Jesus has not rid him of his feelings, but rather, heightened them, adding an overwhelming guilt, his next step is suicide.  (This basic idea was originally used by Herman Melville is his Christ-like story of &quot;Billy Budd,&quot; but this is the first time I've seen it used in such a literal way.)  And you know what?

560447,A2RH7ARWQSUVQV,B00004YVEG,"Ron Braithwaite ""Hummingbird God""","[1, 1]","The play is overly glitzy and self-consciously avant guarde.  The thing that really saves this interpretation is the basic music and some of the actors and singers.  In that the directors changed so much of the 'look' of this film but seemingly didn't change the music, I suspect that the music itself must be protected by copyright laws.  If the directors had taken the liberties with the music that they did with virtually everything else, this film would have been a disaster.That said, the music is great as are some of the characters especially 'Judas', 'Pilate', 'Caiphus', 'Anias', 'Simon' and even 'Mary Magdalene'.  'Jesus' is a disaster which I attribute to deliberate misdirection as opposed to poor acting.  The Jesus-character is nerdy, ordinary, silly even girlish.  A 'Messiah' like this couldn't have led a scout troop let alone a major religious movement.  I'll contrast this 'Jesus' with Neeley's 1973 Jesus, a sometimes confused man but wtih interior greatness.The decision to portray Jesus' followers as street people, gangsters and bikers is questionable.  Why not make them up like Pennsylvannia Amish or California surfers?  Portrayal of Pilate and his people as fascist operatives is OK in that the Roman Empire, with its Fasces of Power [sticks bound together with an axe connoting non-lethal and capital punishment] was the original Fascist State from which all others would draw inspiration.  On the other hand, dressing up the crowd screaming for Jesus' death as Orthodox Jews is deeply offensive.  Sure, sure, sure the directors might have been trying to make a contrarian point about some Christian denominations ascribing guilt for Jesus' death as being 'Jewish Guilt' but, in my humble opinion, the directors of this thing way, way overdo it.  It looks and sounds overtly antisemitic or, at the very least, anti-Orthodox Jewry.  Not pretty.It is also confusing.  The powerful Pilate-figure blasts out his power and hatefulness but, when it comes to actually executing Jesus, he is bound by the original lyrics of the play.  Inexplicably, he 'blinks'.  He doesn't want to execute Jesus but finds his hand forced by the antipathy of the Jesus-hating Jewish crowd.  This is truly ironic and confusing.  Big, powerful, strong-voiced Nazi Pilate is nothing but a wimp.  He breaks like a rotten stick.  So here we have a situation in which Nazi-Pilate doesn't want to execute Jewish Jesus but bows down in front of an anti-Jesus Jewish mob.

This is the best DVD I have...I watch it almost every day. Those of you who are used to the 70s version are in for a little surprise- the theme of the movie is a lot darker, also more contemporary. Jesus comes out in the first scene wearing cargo pants and a tank top.  The performances, however, were absolutely amazing-- especially Glenn Carter's. I have never heard anyone who could sing as well as him (he has the widest vocal range I have ever heard)- his acting is incredible, and his song, gesthamane, brought me to tears. The best thing about him, I think, is the way he's able to portray Christ's emotions and, especially, his fears. Usually when I watch a crucifixion on TV I can't relate to the actor, because Christ has usually been portrayed as some cold, distant person (there are some exeptions, mind you). But when Glenn Carter is portraying the crucifixion and the 39 lashes you can see the fear and pain on his face- you feel like you're being pulled into the performance.  Renee Castle did a wonderful job too, with a beautiful voice and a very good perception of her character. Jerome Pradon's acting was phenomenal, but his singing, I think, could have been better. I think some of this songs were out of his voice range-- you can hear his voice squeak quite a few times.  I was also very impressed with Pilate- a huge difference from Barry Dennen in the 70s JCS. Pilate (Fred Johanson) is authorative and intimidating- he looks like he's about 6'5. And his voice is amazing, deep and rich, and his acting is very convincing. Overall I think the movie was a great success- the choreography and music is good as well. They filled in the gaps where no one's singing very cleverly, so you can actually see what's going on, not like in the 70's version where it looked like Ted Neely was having mood swings.

560453,A1N5YEQ29VU3C2,B00004YVEG,Trout26,"[2, 2]","Most of the reviews that I have read are basically a comparison between this version, the original concept album, and the '73 Jewison film. Up front I'll say that from a purly musical standard, nothing will equal the original album. Although the quality of the singing in the '73 film was generally excellent, the imagery of the hippies going out into the desert to make a low-budget production never worked for me - even though I was a teen myself in the 70s when the film was released.Now, in my 50s, I have to say that this production, taken as an entire piece of theater, is mor emotionally moving than any previous version that I have seen. The emphasis here is on how Christ's mission on earth was so misunderstood by his followers, and how his end was the result of the ruling church leaders wanting him gone to protect their own power.The decision to portray the Disciples as radical youth - even with gang inferences is a brilliant parallel to how the ""real"" disciples were viewed by the ""establishment"" of the time. The Jews of his time were expecting their ""Messiah"" to lead them in physically overthrowing the Romans and become their new king on earth. This is chillingly portrayed during ""Simon Zealotes"" when a case of assault rifles is unpacked and the whole chorus is armed and trying to Jesus one; the tragic look on Jesus' face in being so misunderstood is chilling.The high priests are perhaps a bit ""over-played"", but if you listen carefull to the score, the music itself is somewhat over the top and laced with irony - and I have never heard a deeper bass sing Ciaphas anywhere. If I have a criticism it is that Pilate really does over-do his acting (perhaps it played better on stage), but he still manages to convey his reluctance to condemn Jesus during the trail (largely because he fears how he may be remembered in legacy).Visually, the progression of Jesus throughout the production is also interesting.  When we first see him he is wearing a tank top and fatigues; he looks no different than any of the other young men on stage (although I wish they would have had his hair pulled back in a pony tail for this scene). Then, as the crowd continues to elevate him to more and more of a ""God"" status, his clothing gradually changes until he looks more like a ""traditional"" Jesus in a long white robe.Judas has never been more perfectly played. You can tell that he and Jesus are very close friends, and as the older of the two, Judas is constantly trying to inject a more level-headed approach into Jusus' actions, and readily shows his frustration and anger when he is being ignored. I have never seen Judas' anguish over turning on a friend so emotionally played as in this production. In the finale, when Judas becomes a ""modern"" commentator on the crucifixion, the sneering and sarcasm reflect, chillingly, on what religion has become to so many people today.I was in tears during ""Gesthemene"". People complain that there are no ""power screams"" in this production. Personally, I find this a great relief; even in my teens I never thought that they worked in this context. The anguish of ""the agony in the garden"" is unmistakable and left me breathless.Jesus Christ Superstar is first and foremost a theater piece. Theater is a combination of acting, singing, staging, costuming, and directing. Rarely in a production are all of the individual elements at 100%, but the gestalt makes up for it.

560455,A35L2E8M7S59MQ,B00004YVEG,V. Berk,"[2, 3]","As a lifetime fan of Jesus Christ Superstar who has opened his mind to many interpretations of this story, and of the music, I must say that Jesus Christ Superstar 2000 is perhaps my least favorite ""professional"" production of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice's classic rock-opera.  Perhaps I am biased from being raised on the 70s film starring Ted Neely in the role of Christ, and Carl Anderson as Judas, but I honestly don't think that I am biased, even having heard Neely live, for I have accepted many other recordings.  The cast of 2000 is just not right!  It is flawed in many, many ways.For starters I'm going to do presentation.  The entire film is set in essential the same sets, which I have no problem with, seeing as I'm a proud fan of theater.  My problem is not the sets, but the entire art design of this production.  What I do have a problem with is that this production destroys what the best productions had aimed for, which was finding common ground for ALL audiences.  One major appeal of the 1970s film was that they tried to not discriminate against the Romans, or the Jewish leaders; it was very open, and fair in its portrayals, even adding a song to Caiaphas and Annas to show that their reaction to Jesus' popularity wasn't of spite, but of fear (which, given the time, is COMPLETELY understandable).  In this production the Jewish leaders are portrayed as evil, and I'm not Jewish, but this just is low, because anyone who has studied history should know that the reaction to Jesus was completely natural; no one wanted a rabble rouser to start a problem...because that would mean the Roman army would come back.  Also, every character in this production - even the lepers - all look GREAT, as in fine specimens of the human race.Getting around to the performers; Glen Carter leads the cast and as Jesus falls short in every regard.  He seems to have come for a church choir audition oblivious to the fact that this is a ROCK (key word being ROCK) opera.  His soft, mellow voice is not fit for the role in the slightest.  Even worse is the fact that he just isn't at all convincing in the role.  Take away Ted Neely's beard and long hair in the original film and he STILL gave a convincing performance in the role; the intensity in his eyes as if he knew something was great and he radiated a strong presence.  Glen Carter has no such aura.J&eacute;rme Pradon is the real problem with this production.  His scratchy voice is not at all fitting for the role of Judas, who is actually SUPPOSED to be the real star of this musical.  This musical is mainly from Judas' perspective, and he is supposed to be a sympathetic character whose path has been set by God and he can't change it.  2000's portrayal returns the nihilistic interpretation where Judas is shown as nothing more that a schemer, and given the way Pradon sings the part it's obvious they wanted the most snake-like voice they could find when casting.  Whoever lead the production seems oblivious the fact that this musical's point was to show Judas in a human light.In all there are a few good numbers in here, but nothing that really stands out.  What I remember most is just how dumbed down they've made the story.  For the flogging here there is more blood than the original film, but no where near as brutal (they have people SLAP him in this one...SLAPPING!).  They've turned a musical that shows the complex, human aspects of these historic figures and turned it into a simple ""Good and Evil"" story.  In one line they even have Annas say ""Is that it for the Jewish dream?"" in a maniacal tone while Jesus is taken to trial...isn't' Annas SUPPOSED TO BE JEWISH?!  The logic of this lyric particularly has me baffled because people into history should know that the Jewish leaders acted on what they believed to be their best interest, not to destroy their own dreams.  So its little things like this that make an otherwise stylish production lose all value with me as a fan of the musical.I guess this version is meant for the more traditional Christians than the original, but at that price it totally ostracizes anyone outside the Christian faith.  As a Christian, and a fan of this musical, I was not at all impressed by this production.  Numbers that should have rocked the house such as Heaven On Their Minds, Gethsemane, and Superstar fall horribly flat while the only good numbers are small ones such as Pilate And Christ, Jesus Must Die, Simon Zealotes, and Peter's Denial.  This is the most forgettable version of the musical I have ever seen and I recommend you sticking with the original which is a thought provoking, timeless classic with rocking tunes and performers with sheer talent.P.S.

For the majority of the cast, the voices and overall acting were on-the-dot. It was much better than the 1973 movie, and the energy of a live performance shone through, which is usually difficult in transferring stage to film.My only problem was with Glenn Carter. His voice was too sweet, even in the more confrontational sequences, and he couldn't hit any of the necessary high passages for Jesus without going into an extremely weak falsetto. His acting was all right at best in many parts, and in other parts, abyssmal. He is even smiling while he chases out the moneychangers.However, Jesus can really be overlooked in such a show as Superstar, as he is merely a central character around whom all the action revolves. The rest of the cast is sensational at worst. Special kudos to the lighting at the beginning of the betrayal, and to making the priests into illuminati.The only other bad thing I have to say is on the part of the directors.  Judas becomes too evil too quickly, and we don't see his emerging doubts.  These particular decisions are usually more in the hands of directors than actors, so I'll lay it on their doorstep.",4,"Definative, if not miscast",999820800,"09 7, 2001",2001,1235,"['definative', 'version', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'Superstar', 'now', 'available', 'must', 'say', 'am', 'pleased', 'majority', 'cast', 'voices', 'overall', 'acting', 'were', 'on-the-dot', 'was', 'much', 'better', '1973', 'movie', 'energy', 'live', 'performance', 'shone', 'usually', 'difficult', 'transferring', 'stage', 'film.My', 'only', 'problem', 'was', 'Glenn', 'Carter', 'voice', 'was', 'too', 'sweet', 'even', 'more', 'confrontational', 'sequences', 'could', ""n't"", 'hit', 'necessary', 'high', 'passages', 'Jesus', 'going', 'extremely', 'weak', 'falsetto', 'acting', 'was', 'right', 'best', 'many', 'parts', 'other', 'parts', 'abyssmal', 'even', 'smiling', 'out', 'moneychangers.However', 'Jesus', 'can', 'really', 'be', 'overlooked', 'such', 'show', 'Superstar', 'merely', 'central', 'character', 'whom', 'action', 'rest', 'cast', 'sensational', 'worst', 'Special', 'kudos', 'lighting', 'beginning', 'betrayal', 'making', 'priests', 'illuminati.The', 'only', 'other', 'bad', 'thing', 'have', 'say', 'part', 'directors', 'Judas', 'too', 'evil', 'too', 'quickly', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'emerging', 'doubts', 'particular', 'decisions', 'are', 'usually', 'more', 'hands', 'directors', 'actors', ""'ll"", 'lay', 'doorstep']",N/A
560457,A38JKOT65RLZ9Q,B00004YVEG,Wayne Rossi,"[3, 4]","Allow me to summarize Jesus Christ Superstar's plot for you, roughly:John 11:1-19:41.There you go.  A bit out of order, but that's the story JCS presents to you in somewhat more modern, rock tones.  And then there's a bit of history that goes with the rock opera.Jesus Christ Superstar started out as a concept album based on the work of an up-and-coming British composer/lyricist team, Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice.  It was released in 1970, a hit in the US, and not long after, JCS was produced on Broadway.  In 1973, a film by Norman Jewisson was produced, with some decidedly avant-garde choices of set and scenery, and a very '70s feel to the piece.  JCS kept going strong, including the Australian / New Zealand concert tour in 1992-93 (with dramatic re-envisioning of the musical elements) and the major 1996 British revival, which created a second concept album and brought stardom for Glenn Carter when he took on the role of Jesus.  (The 1970 concept album, Broadway cast recording, Australian cast recording, and 1996 concept album are all great entries in a cast album collection.)In 1999, I believe, Gale Edwards revived the musical again, this time with rather minimalist staging (mostly centered around a very gothic set, with lighting as a major, major element) and starring Glenn Carter, again, as Jesus.  The costuming was modern, with bizarre choices for the priests and Roman guards, as well as for the ensemble in the second act.  Andrew Lloyd Webber, upon seeing this production, knew that it was the one that needed to be captured on film.  So, a cast was assembled and made into one incredible movie.Glenn Carter plays Jesus, and does a dang good job of it.  He has a very distinctive voice and look for the role, such that he seems Jesus-ish even without a beard.  Carter's performance throughout is strong, bringing particular portions (such as &quot;Surely you're not saying we have the resources...&quot; in Everything's Alright) to completely new life.  He is very much a great physical presence in the film, and absolutely brings the house down with his rendition of Gethsemane, and it shows in this film.French theatre star Jerome Pradon plays Judas Iscariot.  His inimicable singing voice adds just the right dimension to Rice's lyrics over ALW's music time and time again.  Visually, he re-defines the role of Judas--Jerome is downright frightening in a rather simple costume, including black leather jacket.  He is also a spectacular visual actor, and it is wonderful to see a Jerome performance on film record.  Particularly great are his Heaven on Their Minds (the first song with lyrics) and Superstar (last song with lyrics).  Throughout, he is certainly not a great person, but remains slightly sympathetic to the viewer.Renee Castle is Mary Magdalene.  She takes the role to its own heights, especially in I Don't Know How to Love Him, which is entirely her own song by the time she's done singing it.  Mary is clearly and vividly portrayed here, and her interaction with Jesus makes IDKHtLH seem perfectly in place when she sings it.For these three performances alone, the video is a must-buy.  But there's more.  Fred Johanson's Pontius Pilate is a strong and downright scary rendition, and although it's not my favorite (listen to David Burt on the 1996 concept album), it comes close.  Very close.  There is a brutal force of character to be watched here.  Rik Mayall as King Herod takes the most fun song in the show (the only fun song), and turns it into a somehow grotesque pageant, complete with lots of dancers.  It is the delivery of this piece that keeps it in pace with the rest of the show.Frederick B. Owens as Caiaphas and Michael Shaeffer as Annas make for an otherworldly pair--for the bass, you've got a large, angry, shaven-headed, impossibly deep-voiced, goateed black man, with a Darth Vader look to him, and for the tenor you have a thin, pale, frighteningly hairless white man.  Both make an incredible impression, especially on the definitive version of This Jesus Must Die.  Tony Vincent (dubbed &quot;The Militant Backstreet Boy&quot;) and Calvin Cornwall as Simon and Peter, respectively, bring a freshness to the roles.  Particularly, Cornwall's brief Peter's Denial establishes more character than has been seen in the song in most of the other recordings.  In Simon Zealotes, Vincent is downright convincing as well.  These songs both establish that even the ensemble in this film is spectacular.Much of the movie--the use of about three sets for twenty-four scenes, with just lighting for the incredible variations, and the unique look of the film--must be seen to be experienced.  This movie is, fundamentally, a stage production transformed into a film, and it works.  There is no &quot;staged&quot; feeling here, and the whole thing flows remarkably smoothly considering that there are no real transitions in Jesus Christ Superstar.  Many (such as the brilliant change from Judas' Death to Trial Before Pilate) are almost daring beyond imagination.  In general, this movie can be appreciated by those with no, some, or extensive knowledge of the musical.  It's a treat to see it performed so well, and I think that every ALW fan, every Tim Rice fan, every JCS fan, and heck, every musical fan could benefit from owning this sweet, sweet recording.  And even if you're not a musical fan, you can still enjoy this film.",5,Best...JCS...ever!,1001462400,"09 26, 2001",2001,5395,"['Allow', 'summarize', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'Superstar', 'plot', 'roughly',

560458,A1MG1OFWEC587Y,B00004YVEG,Word Nerd,"[0, 0]","I composed a review for this version of Jesus Christ Superstar several years ago and have been itching to update it recently. At present, I'm in total Explore Mode when it comes to musicals, operas, and theatre. I currently have both Franco Zefirelli's production of Puccini's La Boheme and the film version of Rent awaiting my attention--which I'm excited about, but first I feel a need to have another go at talking about this production of Superstar. When I initially saw it, I got annoyed with it for variations from the Jewison film but later realized I was complaining about smaller things and missing larger, much more important things that give this production a beauty in its own right. Ultimately, I have come to appreciate this Superstar as a piece of theatre, a different medium and a different kind of storytelling which paints people, drama, ideas, and feelings in its own way.First of all, I really want to say that I'm not in the &#34;let's hate on Jerome Pradon&#34; gang. Pradon has taken some fire for his portrayal of Judas but I really think the vitriol is undeserved in many cases. Pradon's voice and approach are different to the classic Carl Anderson portryal but their supposed to be. Give him a chance. In my opinion, Pradon gives a Judas who is conflicted, torn, twisted, pained, and pent up. You really need to watch his performance, and watch it carefully, to get the full effect of his characterization. He's not a belter like Carl Anderson, so don't expect the same voice or quite the same take. On their own, his vocals wouldn't be earth-shattering, although I quite enjoy hearing the hints of French in his enunciation and the soft yet still rock-tinged and sometimes edgy European sound about them, but when you watch him, Pradon is a born actor. He acts every sung line and his physical/visual performance is wonderful. The guy just has a great, animated face, through which myriad emotions surge during the course of his performance. Some people seem to think Judas in this production is completely evil. I disagree. He can be smug and mocking, especially towards the other disciples and towards Mary, and also impulsive and quick-tempered. He may think he knows best and he may be just too much of an independent thinker to be anyone's disciple, but the fact that he loves Jesus comes through every time he realizes he has hurt his friend. Again, just watch Pradon's face.There's comedy but there's also drama and angst in his performance. He makes Judas human and multi-dimensional. He does tend to wail when singing but nonetheless, The Last Supper is amazing at times in terms of emotional delivery as is the moment of betrayal. The connection between Judas and Jesus in that moment could not have been more effective. Judas ` Death is painful--but it's meant to be. The staging when Judas is alone singing I Don't Know How to Love Him is beautiful-- filled with primal emotion. Judas is splayed on the floor, looking almost like he himself is being crucified at one point. And the staging of Superstar, the title number, is really interesting in this production. It's just a completely different approach to the song and the vocals. That sequence, along with Pradon's version of Damned for All Time/Blood money are phenomenal and it'ss largely down to Jerome Pradon, who makes the character his own in a totally unique way. Let him not be Carl. He's Jerome. Let this be Jerome's Judas; don't demand that it be Carl's or Murray Head's. I love watching this interpretation at times.Otherwise, this production of Superstar is eye-catching, visually engrossing, and representative of a complete vision in its staging. Its setting leaps to life with a postmodern production design including broad strokes of distopic imagery. Wardrobe is generally excellent given what they were going for, with some great character-appropriate costuming choices. Simon Zealotes, transformed into a shallow warmonger, wears camouflage and boots and the Roman guards become faceless metallic men of armor. Free-spirited Jesus wears kakis and kaftans at various points. Judas looks sharp as hell in leathers and jeans.As for the set, the back wall is covered in graffiti and creative designs, including slogans in both English and French. Why French? Who knows! But I find it really fun and interesting to try explore what's drawn on the wall, even though it's only distantly visibly in many shots, to look at the artistry and what it signifies. Starting with a great close-up of a graphitized &#34;HATE&#34;, much of the Overture is spent in close-up shots and pans across the wall, allowing us to really take in the designs. I find this device fascinating. It gives us a powerful sense of this story's setting; the life and times of the characters. The setting in this production definitely carries an environment of heightened reality: at times, it seems more representative of people, places, emotions, and themes than it is a physical depiction of them in a literal sense.All of these characters are fully drawn. Glenn Carter has a strong voice and is generally solid as Jesus. I sometimes feel I'm not sold on him, but then there are some reactions of his that I totally. Watch the interaction with Judas during the Last Supper and the moment of betrayal--there are astounding moments. Carter plays Jesus as compassionate and peaceful but also moody if not neurotic. Other highlights include Fred Johanson's Pilate and Michael Schaeffer's Annas. The former is a striking new characterization, painting Pilate as a weak man in the guise of a strong one, a man who seems to view his role to be as much that of a showman as a governor and who lives in terror of losing the people's support. Annas is remarkable just for being a perfectly detestable villain. Watch how, both in Blood Money and in Judas' Death, he physically abuses Judas, shouting and shoving him about. I like quirky falsetto Annas too, but this one just oozes evil from every pore--a brilliant character performance, which upstages Frederick B. Owens' Caiaphas and nearly makes Annas into the arch villain.Drawing cogent and striking parallels with cultural sociopolitical dynamics of today, Jesus' disciples are portrayed as countercultural revolutionaries who are rebelling against the Roman Empire. They are even gang-like and violent at times, largely thanks to Simon, whose number becomes an overt anti-war and anti-violence statement. In this production, the segment beginning with Hosanna and moving directly into Simon's song perfectly exemplifies why Judas fears the &#34;Jesus movement&#34; is beyond anyone's control and is dangerous both to Jesus and to society--one of many choices that excellently heightens the themes and places emphasis completely on storytelling.Renee Castle's Mary fits in this production well but I personally prefer Yvonne Elliman's singing. No one has Elliman's quality of voice. There is, however, an interesting moment immediately after I Don't Know how to Love him. Pradon's Judas catches Mary about to kiss Jesus, who is asleep. It does show the nastier smug side of this Judas that some people really don't like, but what's interesting to me is that the moment is played entirely with visuals, set to that fantastic piece of Lloyd Webber scoring that leads into Damned for All Time (the guitar and flute part). In the Jewison film, this is the scene where Judas is chased by the army tanks representing propulsive forces making him betray Christ.It's really no surprise that people used to the '73 film have a hard time adjusting to this one but I find this sequence especially interesting. We watch Judas, Mary, and Jesus (who awakes on Judas' arrival) express their feelings only through their facial expressions. We have to watch every moment to grasp the emotions they are experiencing. There is genuine subtlety here and, as is so often true in this production, you can see the wheels turning in characters' heads from moment to moment. The intense theatrical lighting on Judas as we see a change come over him is the perfect finishing touch.This sequence captures what I like most about this production of Superstar, along with its emotional depth and three-dimensional character treatments: through visual abstraction, it paints an intense hyper-reality that represents characters' feelings and actions more than it directly shows them at times. Through its visuals, it is at times akin to visual poetry or a cousin to ballet. In Judas' Death the noose is lowered onto to the stage by unseen hands, presenting itself to him. During Blood Money, Judas crawls from the priests in a futile attempt to escape fate and Jesus later does the same, crawling desperately from the crowd baying for his blood as Pilate gives the death sentence.This Superstar is visually stunning at times in a way completely different to the equally powerful cinematic rendition. It uses a unique medium of visual storytelling to convey drama in a uniquely compelling way. Watch the final moments, as Jesus' body is placed on the stage. Gradually, the characters depart until only Judas and Mary, the two other key players, are looking on. And Judas fittingly does witness and feel the Crucifixion in this version even though he is dead. Judas and Mary, who have been stretched with tension throughout the story, stand together over Christ's body. This is a portrait of the characters and emotional journey of the play. It is poetry composed by moving people on a live canvas. It is visual and kinesthetic poetry. In short, it is theatre.",4,Theatrically Splendid,1394668800,"03 13, 2014",2014,9549,"['composed', 'review', 'version', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'Superstar', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'have', 'been',

I was captured right from the beginning and couldn't believe how great it is! This production is a piece of theatre caught on screen.  I experienced everything I could have experienced in a real theatre while sitting in the front row: the realness, the dramatics, and the rawness, plus the surround Dolby 5.1, which, however, cannot be experienced from the stage.  This musical itself is the kind of show that no matter where the stage is set, the essence and the musicality will always be there.  However, when it is set in the 90s New York City, the effectiveness of the drama is magically amplified and intensified.  Moreover, the T-shirt garbed, young and vigorous disciples in the hippest hairstyles, and the catchy choreography are simply closer to the young people at our time.Musical is meant for the theatre and stage.  It needs a stage, no matter if it is a real stage or one on screen.  Once the play is set on the stage, everything falls into place. The theatrical acting becomes quite captivating.  I could point out a few weaknesses of the vocal delivery in the show, but they are complemented by the greatness of the acting.""He is a man, he's just a man.""  While Glen Carter reveals the human nature of Jesus Christ very truthfully (definitely with credit to his look and figure), he couples the outside softness with the inner strength very well and creates the profoundness and extraordinariness of Jesus.  ""Every word you say today gets twisted round some other way.""  The complexity of Judas is more emphasized on his loyalty to his mission, rather than his greediness.  Jerome Pradon, taking on the most challenging part in both acting and singing, is remarkably good.  ""I don't know how to love him."" The soothing and smooth voice of Renee Castle distinguishes herself as the best Mary Magdalene I've ever heard.  Tony Vincent, Wow! Just couldn't be better. The ardency in his singing and acting catches the rebelliousness of Simon Zealotes brilliantly.This is the show that once you start watching, you won't be able to pull yourself out. So get yourself a comfortable chair, let music wash you, let emotions drown you, let words and melodies hit, sadden, and inspire you.  This is the magic created by Andrew Lloyd Webber, Tim Rice, Gale Edwards, the cast, and many others.",5,The Great Jesus Christ Superstar,1015286400,"03 5, 2002",2002,2388,"['had', 'watched', '70s', 'film', 'version', 'JCS', 'was', 'not', 'impressed', 'much', 'then', 'had', 'DVD', 'was', 'captured', 'right', 'beginning', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', 'great', 'production', 'piece', 'theatre', 'caught', 'screen', 'experienced', 'everything', 'could', 'have', 'experienced', 'real', 'theatre', 'sitting', 'front', 'row', 'realness', 'dramatics', 'rawness', 'surround', 'Dolby', '5.1', 'however', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'experienced', 'stage', 'musical', 'kind', 'show', 'matter', 'where', 'stage', 'set', 'essence', 'musicality', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'there', 'However', 'when', 'set', '90s', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'effectiveness', 'drama', 'magically', 'amplified', 'intensified', 'Moreover', 'T-shirt', 'garbed', 'young', 'vigorous', 'disciples', 'hippest', 'hairstyles', 'catchy', 'choreography', 'are', 'simply', 'closer', 'young', 'people', 'time.Musical', 'meant', 'theatre', 'stage', 'stage', 'matter', 'real', 'stage', 'one', 'screen', 'play', 'set', 'stage', 'everything', 'falls', 'place', 'theatrical', 'acting', 'quite', 'captivating', 'could', 'point', 'out', 'few', 'weaknesses', 'vocal', 'delivery', 'show', 'are', 'complemented', 'greatness', 'acting', 'man', 'just', 'man', 'Glen', 'Carter', 'human', 'nature', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'very', 'truthfully', 'definitely', 'credit', 'look', 'figure', 'outside', 'softness', 'inner', 'strength', 'very', 'well', 'profoundness', 'extraordinariness', 'Jesus', 'word', 'say', 'today', 'twisted', 'round', 'other', 'way', 'complexity', 'Judas', 'more', 'emphasized', 'loyalty', 'mission', 'rather', 'greediness', 'Jerome', 'Pradon', 'taking', 'most', 'challenging', 'part', 'acting', 'singing', 'remarkably', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'love', 'soothing', 'smooth', 'voice', 'Renee', 'Castle', 'best', 'Mary', 'Magdalene', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'Tony', 'Vincent', 'Wow', 'Just', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'better', 'ardency', 'singing', 'acting', 'catches', 'rebelliousness', 'Simon', 'Zealotes', 'brilliantly.This', 'show', 'once', 'start', 'watching', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'pull', 'out', 'So', 'get', 'comfortable', 'chair', 'let', 'music', 'wash', 'let', 'emotions', 'drown', 'let', 'words', 'melodies', 'hit', 'sadden', 'inspire', 'magic', 'created', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'Tim', 'Rice', 'Gale', 'Edwards', 'cast', 'many', 'others']",N/A
