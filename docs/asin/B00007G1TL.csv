Guild,"[0, 1]","This 1952 B&W; ,89 minute movie is typical of the flood of westerns we got from Hollywood.All the great actors were in them along with many other lead and supporting actors.I remember this period when I was in High School.I lived in a small town of 5000,and we had 2 theatres.Each theatre played 3 different movies a week.Without exception,Monday and Tuesday were love movies,Wednesday and Thursdays were war stories,horror ,etc., and Friday and Saturday were Westerns.Before the main feature there were the ""shorts"" which include ,World News,and a ""cartoon"" such as The Three Stooges,or a serial such as Superman .There was a matinee at 3:30 pm,and two showings in the evening at 7pm. & 9PmThere is still a Western or two produced these days ,but they are not what we used to get.Nowadays we get a lot of ballyhoo and buildup and the movies are real letdowns.Brokeback Mountain simply wasn't worth the time and well,The Lone Ranger was a flop.So what's a person to do who wants to watch a ""good western""? Simple, dig up one of the oldies.Big Trees features Douglas as a con-man,who takes a gang of lumbermen from Wisconsin to California to make millions chopping down the big Redwoods. He tries to use legal loopholes to push a settlement of Quakers aside and get at the valuable timber.There are several real interesting and well developed characters,none any less so than a beautiful Quaker who smittens the con man and turns him around.There is lots of action and a great runway log train ,trestel explosion and wreck.A great entertaining hour and a half from a period when Hollywood could and did make good Westerns.",5,When a con man falls for a Quaker sister;he meets his match.,1380067200,"09 25, 2013",2013,1621,"['1952', 'B', 'W', ',89', 'minute', 'movie', 'typical', 'flood', 'westerns', 'got', 'Hollywood.All', 'great', 'actors', 'were', 'many', 'other', 'lead', 'supporting', 'actors.I', 'remember', 'period', 'when', 'was', 'High', 'School.I', 'lived', 'small', 'town', '5000', 'had', '2', 'theatres.Each', 'theatre', 'played', '3', 'different', 'movies', 'week.Without', 'exception', 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'were', 'love', 'movies', 'Wednesday', 'Thursdays', 'were', 'war', 'stories', 'horror', 'etc.', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'were', 'Westerns.Before', 'main', 'feature', 'were', 'shorts', 'include', 'World', 'News', 'cartoon', 'such', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'serial', 'such', 'Superman', '.There', 'was', 'matinee', '3:30', 'pm', 'two', 'showings', 'evening', '7pm', '9PmThere', 'still', 'Western', 'two', 'produced', 'days', 'are', 'not', 'what', 'used', 'get.Nowadays', 'get', 'lot', 'ballyhoo', 'buildup', 'movies', 'are', 'real', 'letdowns.Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'simply', 'was', ""n't"", 'time', 'well', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'was', 'flop.So', 'what', 'person', 'do', 'who', 'watch', 'good', 'western', 'Simple', 'dig', 'up', 'one', 'oldies.Big', 'Trees', 'Douglas', 'con-man', 'who', 'gang', 'lumbermen', 'Wisconsin', 'California', 'make', 'millions', 'chopping', 'down', 'big', 'Redwoods', 'use', 'legal', 'loopholes', 'push', 'settlement', 'Quakers', 'aside', 'get', 'valuable', 'are', 'several', 'real', 'interesting', 'well', 'developed', 'characters', 'none', 'less', 'so', 'beautiful', 'Quaker', 'who', 'con', 'man', 'around.There', 'lots', 'action', 'great', 'runway', 'log', 'train', 'trestel', 'explosion', 'wreck.A', 'great', 'entertaining', 'hour', 'half', 'period', 'when', 'Hollywood', 'could', 'did', 'make', 'good', 'Westerns']",The Big Trees

727947,AK61LQI92GTCH,B00007G1TL,"Steven Hellerstedt ""SH""","[15, 18]","THE BIG TREES starts out with a great deal of promise - Kirk Douglas stars as Jim Fallon, a Wisconsin timber baron who plans to take advantage of a new law that will allow him to `harvest' California's giant sequoias and make a fortune in the process.The movie opens in Wisconsin where Fallon is facing down a growling work crew.  The pay is late, again, and the men have just about had it.  Drawing on his deep well of nerve and blarney and charm, as well as a well-timed gunshot from soon-to-be sidekick `Yukon' Burns (Edgar Buchanan), Fallon not only avoids a bloody mutiny but he even manages to talk the crew into migrating to California where, seemingly, money does indeed grow on trees.So far so good.  THE BIG TREES might be a cut above.  The first scene in California (the movie was filmed in Orlick) has Fallon and Yukon measuring the diameter of a giant redwood.  It measures out at twenty-eight feet, and the scene is only slightly jarred by the shadow of the camera and boom during this attractive tracking shot.The hitch in Fallon's plans take the form of Friends, or Quakers, who regard the ancient redwoods as sacred objects.  They hold their religious services outdoors, nestled in this majestic sequoia cathedral.  Nestled in the bosom of the Quaker community is the beautiful Alicia Chadwick (Eve Miller) (the dvd biography on Miller tells us she was a Playmate of the Month a couple years after THE BIG TREES was released.)Love trumps Greed and, the last time I looked, Beauty is batting 1.000 against the Beast.  Fallon doesn't stand a chance, but before this movie loses all momentum and devolves into a group tree-hug a second group of lumber hungry sociopaths make their presence felt.It's about then that THE BIG TREES took a big turn and morphed into a Starched Shirt western.  Characters chop down trees and wrestle the bad guy on a shaky rope bridge spanning a deep gorge and then show up in the next scene in a spotlessly clean starched shirt.  The last half of this movie is corny and formulaic, and betrays the promising start.Still and all THE BIG TREES is entertaining, well-acted, and good looking.",3,"You like me, don't you?",1085961600,"05 31, 2004",2004,2132,"['BIG', 'TREES', 'out', 'great', 'deal', 'promise', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'Jim', 'Fallon', 'Wisconsin', 'timber', 'baron', 'who', 'take', 'advantage', 'new', 'law', 'will', 'allow', 'harvest', 'California', 'giant', 'sequoias', 'make', 'fortune', 'process.The', 'movie', 'Wisconsin', 'where', 'Fallon', 'facing', 'down', 'growling', 'work', 'crew', 'pay', 'late', 'again', 'men', 'have', 'just', 'about', 'had', 'Drawing', 'deep', 'well', 'nerve', 'blarney', 'charm', 'as', 'well', 'well-timed', 'gunshot', 'soon-to-be', 'sidekick', 'Yukon', 'Burns', 'Edgar', 'Buchanan', 'Fallon', 'not', 'only', 'bloody', 'mutiny', 'even', 'talk', 'crew', 'migrating', 'California', 'where', 'seemingly', 'money', 'indeed', 'grow', 'trees.So', 'far', 'so', 'good', 'BIG', 'TREES', 'might', 'be', 'cut', 'first', 'scene', 'California', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'Orlick', 'Fallon', 'Yukon', 'measuring', 'diameter', 'giant', 'redwood', 'out', 'twenty-eight', 'feet', 'scene', 'only', 'slightly', 'jarred', 'shadow', 'camera', 'boom', 'attractive', 'tracking', 'shot.The', 'hitch', 'Fallon', 'plans', 'take', 'form', 'Friends', 'Quakers', 'who', 'regard', 'ancient', 'redwoods', 'sacred', 'objects', 'hold', 'religious', 'services', 'outdoors', 'nestled', 'majestic', 'sequoia', 'cathedral', 'Nestled', 'bosom', 'Quaker', 'community', 'beautiful', 'Alicia', 'Chadwick', 'Eve', 'Miller', 'dvd', 'biography', 'Miller', 'tells', 'was', 'Playmate', 'Month', 'couple', 'years', 'BIG', 'TREES', 'was', 'released', 'Love', 'trumps', 'Greed', 'last', 'time', 'looked', 'Beauty', 'batting', '1.000', 'Beast', 'Fallon', ""n't"", 'stand', 'chance', 'movie', 'momentum', 'group', 'tree-hug', 'second', 'group', 'lumber', 'hungry', 'sociopaths', 'make', 'presence', 'felt.It', 'then', 'THE', 'BIG', 'TREES', 'took', 'big', 'turn', 'morphed', 'Starched', 'Shirt', 'western', 'Characters', 'chop', 'down', 'trees', 'wrestle', 'bad', 'guy', 'shaky', 'rope', 'bridge', 'spanning', 'deep', 'gorge', 'then', 'show', 'up', 'next', 'scene', 'spotlessly', 'clean', 'starched', 'shirt', 'last', 'half', 'movie', 'corny', 'formulaic', 'promising', 'start.Still', 'THE', 'BIG', 'TREES', 'entertaining', 'well-acted', 'good', 'looking']",The Big Trees
