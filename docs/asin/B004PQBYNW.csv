1423700,A2582KMXLK2P06,B004PQBYNW,B. E Jackson,"[0, 1]","If it wasn't for the final 30 minutes, Endure would have been slapped with a 1-star rating VERY easily.  Mediocrity takes up 60% of the movie.  The problem is that the storyline focuses around two investigators constantly bickering with each other and they hardly ever concentrate on the actual missing woman.  You see throughout the film you occasionally witness a woman tied around a tree.  It's up to the investigation team to find her before time runs out.Tom Arnold tries to play the bad guy but, like always, he's anything but.  Laughable to think of him as a murderer.  Someone else seriously should have been considered for that role besides Tom Arnold, haha.  It doesn't matter anyway- we're not even introduced to Tom until later on.There's definitely a few plot holes, and one of them is that it would seem had the investigators done some thorough work, they would have realized that a search team should have been required to take on the woods a LONG time ago (like, in the first 10 minutes of the film).Like I say above, you have two investigators and one of them has a personal problem with the other because he thinks he's a jerk.  Honestly, he's anything but a jerk.  I never understood why the personal animosity.  The wife is dying of heart failure, but these segments never accomplish much in the way of drama or concern (well, not until the end that is).  More like filler material to fill up a short running time.  In fact the entire film is filler.  That's the problem with it.  The only time the bickering between the two investigators captures my attention is when they discuss beliefs.Weak writing, average acting, and no suspense whatsoever.  I wouldn't even call it drama.  Just mediocre until the final 30 minutes when Tom Arnold's character makes himself known.  Honestly, he should have played a bigger role than what he did.  That would have surely helped us overlook the weak writing.Overall, I can't say I recommend watching this.  There's just not enough interest in most of the storytelling.",3,slow moving investigative work,1332547200,"03 24, 2012",2012,2026,"['was', ""n't"", 'final', '30', 'minutes', 'Endure', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'slapped', '1-star', 'rating', 'VERY', 'easily', 'Mediocrity', 'up', '60', '%', 'movie', 'problem', 'storyline', 'two', 'investigators', 'constantly', 'bickering', 'other', 'hardly', 'ever', 'concentrate', 'actual', 'missing', 'woman', 'see', 'film', 'occasionally', 'witness', 'woman', 'tied', 'tree', 'up', 'investigation', 'team', 'find', 'time', 'runs', 'out.Tom', 'Arnold', 'tries', 'play', 'bad', 'guy', 'always', 'anything', 'Laughable', 'think', 'murderer', 'Someone', 'else', 'seriously', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'considered', 'role', 'Tom', 'Arnold', 'haha', ""n't"", 'matter', 'anyway-', ""'re"", 'not', 'even', 'introduced', 'Tom', 'later', 'definitely', 'few', 'plot', 'holes', 'one', 'would', 'seem', 'had', 'investigators', 'done', 'thorough', 'work', 'would', 'have', 'realized', 'search', 'team', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'required', 'take', 'woods', 'LONG', 'time', 'ago', 'first', '10', 'minutes', 'film', 'say', 'have', 'two', 'investigators', 'one', 'personal', 'problem', 'other', 'jerk', 'Honestly', 'anything', 'jerk', 'never', 'understood', 'why', 'personal', 'animosity', 'wife', 'dying', 'heart', 'failure', 'segments', 'never', 'accomplish', 'much', 'way', 'drama', 'concern', 'well', 'not', 'end', 'More', 'filler', 'material', 'fill', 'up', 'short', 'running', 'time', 'fact', 'entire', 'film', 'filler', 'problem', 'only', 'time', 'bickering', 'two', 'investigators', 'captures', 'attention', 'when', 'discuss', 'beliefs.Weak', 'writing', 'average', 'acting', 'suspense', 'whatsoever', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'call', 'drama', 'Just', 'mediocre', 'final', '30', 'minutes', 'when', 'Tom', 'Arnold', 'character', 'known', 'Honestly', 'should', 'have', 'played', 'bigger', 'role', 'what', 'did', 'would', 'have', 'surely', 'helped', 'overlook', 'weak', 'writing.Overall', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'recommend', 'watching', 'just', 'not', 'enough', 'interest', 'most', 'storytelling']",N/A
1423701,A33EN2ZL2MS0CI,B004PQBYNW,Compay,"[4, 6]","Endure is about what you would expect for most movies that went straight to video.  And while it was shot better than most Redbox fare, it's still not a very exciting movie.Endure follows the story of a seasoned detective who is teamed up with a rookie partner, in search for a kidnapped woman before she ends up dead.The good news is that the cinematography and color correction for the film are both decent, so it doesn't look particularly low-budget.  The film was shot in Lakeland, Florida, so there's a nice combination of older city meets marshland scenes.The bad news is that the story isn't especially interesting.  The film could have easily been condensed into a one-hour episode of CSI, too much of the movie is filler. There is a sub-plot involving the veteran detective's bedridden wife that becomes an annoying distraction as the film progresses.The cast is largely made up of ""Where Are They Now"" actors.  Judd Nelson continues to crank out straight-to-video appearances, and Endure is no exception. Actress Joey Adams of Big Daddy fame scores a fairly pointless role as Nelson's ailing wife, and neither bring much to the table.Despite getting top billing on the DVD cover, Tom Arnold gets a grand total of five minutes of screen time in this film.  Worse yet, nothing about him makes him a remotely scary villain in this film.  Ironically, there's more backstory in this movie on the disturbed kidnapper that dies earlier in the film than there is on Arnold's character.Overall, there's nothing special about this film.  It's not a very moving thriller, the acting is average at best, and the dialogue is very weak.

Let's just put 2 detectives on the case when we know that a woman is tied to a tree and has a day or two before she will probably die. Let's have the lead detective worry more about how to put down and humiliate his partner than hurry the hell up and find this hostage. Let's have the lead detective's wife slowly dying so that he can be distracted further with time running out.The idea behind this movie is a good one and it could have been written into a pretty dang good suspenseful film but sorry, no can do here. Like others have said, Tom Arnold's character is grossly under developed. The sick wife is just an irritating distraction with no value. Judd Nelson's character is barely likeable and he sleepwalks through the movie. His new partner is not too much better.

1423705,A387BD735MI50R,B004PQBYNW,R. Schultz,"[1, 2]","You won't see anything here you haven't already seen in a hundred CSI episodes. But this 2-hour movie has the luxury of taking more time. Occasionally, it uses that extra time to advantage. There are more realistic pauses, more silences as the lead detective lingers at the bedside of his terminally ill wife, played affectionately by Joey Lauren Adams.The wife herself gets to play a bigger part than would ordinarily be possible in the confines of a TV mystery series. Here she languishes appealingly, like Ali McGraw, and with her innocent, little-girl voice, draws us into a love story that's perhaps trite, but still touching.In other ways though, ""Endure"" squanders the extra time at its disposal. It doesn't give us much insight into the character or motivation of the serial killer that Judd Nelson starts to track. There's just a brief, illogical glimpse of some childhood scrawls on a wall. Tom Arnold does a wonderfully sinister turn, but he is given virtually no lines.Overall, this film looks sort of cobbled together, with some of the actors giving the impression of just going through the motions. But if you are simply looking for two hours of distraction, this movie might fill the bill.

The movie really did drag a lot in the middle, and if it was a 60 min show it would have been great.  The extra half hour hurt it a little.
