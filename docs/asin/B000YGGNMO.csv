Likewise, Roselyn Sanchez does a tremendous job in her role as ballet-instructor Monique Vasquez.

I gave it five stars, because The Gameplan is an excellent film for the entire family to enjoy. Duane, ""the Rock"", Johnson stars as Joe Kingman. Kingman is the superstar quarterback for the NFL-type team the Boston Rebels. He has MVP awards, Heisman trophies, endorsements, fans, groupies, money, friends, and a big, big, big ego. Joe's life revolves around Joe. His life is suddenly changed when a cute 8-year old girl shows up at his doorstep claiming to be his daughter (played by Madison Pettis).The girl is named Peyton, and Joe and his agent (played by Kyra Sedgewick) immediately look at the girl as a liability. Still, Joe is stuck with her for a month while her mom is in Africa doing charity work. We quickly learn that Joe never knew about Peyton, and her mom doesn't know that Peyton has gone to find Joe. The movie then goes into the standard scenes of cuteness and comedy, most of which were shown in the preview. Joe has his group of friends and they are all nice guys and they like to visit Joe's for parties and be at the grand opening of Joe's restaurant. Over the course of the movie, Joe leaves Peyton at a club, Peyton floods his bathroom with bubble bath, redecorates his MVP award with beads and makes a mess of things. And they grow closer together, including some funny moments at a ballet studio.Okay, I didn't love this movie, but I found a lot of it to be funny, and my kids loved it. That's why it gets such a high rating. My six year old boy and four year old girl were captivated. The story about Peyton's mom was touching and the movie ends with a good message. As an added bonus, there is no offensive language. While watching a game a Joe's house, the guys are drinking Coke instead of beer. That tells you right there Disney set out to make a ""family"" film, and this one is right on target. I haven't been paying too much attention, but with this movie, along with Enchanted, maybe Disney has finally gotten back to making the great family movies they became famous for.",5,"A great ""family film"".

Then one day a little girl appears on his door step claiming to be his kid he did not know about, and The Rock's life is turned upside down as he discovers what being a father and what kids get up to is about.The plot is not much, I knew what was going to happen only a few minutes into the movie, but by the time it does come, you do feel all warm and mushy and happy through it.I haven't been a fan of The Rocks acting career so far, everything I have seen him in has been pretty average. But I have expected he will do something huge that sticks out for him sooner or later. Funnily enough, so far this is it. I'm sure his best movie is yet to come, but for now this one took the Rock away from all that action and guns kind of thing and shows the lighter side of his acting ability.The little girl, I have no idea who she is, but shes done a pretty good job of acting in this movie. They said in a featurette shes like a 30 year old in a 8 year olds body... nah... shes more believable then that annoying Dakota Fanning and you actually believe this kids a kid.The surprising role for me was Kyra Sedgwick. Usually she plays a very sweet and always smiling character, in this one she is the (that word for a female dog) and I almost did not recognize her for a while. It's defiantly a different character then what you usually see her playing.Overall, it's pretty much what you expect the movie to be, it could have been a bit better with the laughs, but they focused this more as a drama movie with comedy added instead of the other way around. It's a decent family flick, and sure to get bad reviews from those rockin wrestling fans who just want the Rock to go back to sports entertainment.... but they're just going to have to come to terms with it not happening anytime soon and see the Rock is now an actor.",3,Stop!
