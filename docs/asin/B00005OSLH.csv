He even gave a diagram of how to make one whole good man.  I couldn't stop laughing.

Steve Harvey is a funny man and can be quite theatrical at times. He repeated a lot of the jokes he had done on Def Jam, although he did change them a bit. His Def Jam performances were more convincing.On the whole I would rate this above average, but only just.",3,Entertaining,1133481600,"12 2, 2005",2005,357,"['One', 'Man', 'show', 'was', 'entertainng', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'roll', 'around', 'laughter', 'Steve', 'Harvey', 'funny', 'man', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'theatrical', 'times', 'repeated', 'lot', 'jokes', 'had', 'done', 'Def', 'Jam', 'did', 'change', 'bit', 'Def', 'Jam', 'performances', 'were', 'more', 'convincing.On', 'whole', 'would', 'rate', 'average', 'only', 'just']",Platinum Comedy Series - Steve Harvey - One Man
672959,A1P2NBM3P3TS2X,B00005OSLH,"John S. Harris ""The Voice of Reason""","[40, 41]","This is the long-awaited DVD release of Harvey's HBO stand-up special from 1999, taped in Augusta, GA.  It contains what may be Harvey's finest, strongest hour of material.  Funny from joke one to the very end.  He discusses going to church, Tiger Woods, O.J. Simpson (briefly, thank goodness), the difference between firing a white worker and firing a black worker, and how women can build themselves the perfect man.  Best of all, Harvey comes across as a very decent, intelligent, compassionate person.  The language is occasionally raw, but never gratuitously so.Also included on this DVD is his 30-minute Stand-Up segment from HBO's archives, and it is also genuinely funny throughout.",5,VERY funny!,1017532800,"03 31, 2002",2002,690,"['long-awaited', 'DVD', 'release', 'Harvey', 'HBO', 'stand-up', 'special', '1999', 'taped', 'Augusta', 'GA', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'Harvey', 'finest', 'strongest', 'hour', 'material', 'Funny', 'joke', 'one', 'very', 'end', 'going', 'church', 'Tiger', 'Woods', 'O.J', 'Simpson', 'briefly', 'thank', 'goodness', 'difference', 'firing', 'white', 'worker', 'firing', 'black', 'worker', 'how', 'women', 'can', 'build', 'perfect', 'man', 'Best', 'Harvey', 'across', 'very', 'decent', 'intelligent', 'compassionate', 'person', 'language', 'occasionally', 'raw', 'never', 'gratuitously', 'so.Also', 'included', 'DVD', '30-minute', 'Stand-Up', 'segment', 'HBO', 'archives', 'also', 'genuinely', 'funny']",Platinum Comedy Series - Steve Harvey - One Man
