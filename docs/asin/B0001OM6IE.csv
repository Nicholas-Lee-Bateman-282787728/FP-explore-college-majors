812598,A2U2ZPHR54XLSS,B0001OM6IE,DJ,"[31, 31]","I got a chuckle out of Gilad saying this workout was designed for just for men, because of their ""natural strength and abilities.""  I'm thinking Cathe, Jari & Mindy might have something to say about that!  Despite the forgivable machoism (Gilad is such a cutie, after all!), this is a very good workout.  It is broken down into five intervals:  The first interval is the 7-minute warm up.  The second interval is 17 minutes of cardio - here Gilad utilizes boxing moves, including punches, jabs, and skipping rope.  The third interval is 12 minutes of weights, with some upper body work - shoulders, chest, biceps, triceps - and some lower body work - mostly lunges.  The fourth 12-minute interval uses your own body weight - push-ups, sit-ups, and back extensions.  Gilad does these exercises in circuits and puts a little variation in the moves in each new circuit.  The fifth and final circuit is the 7-minute cool down.  Overall, this was a good total-body workout - some cardio, some upper body, some lower body, some abs, and nice stretching afterward.  Plus, the guys are *so cute* when they are trying to be macho with their high-fiving and growling at each other at the end of the workout :-)  This one's a keeper!",5,"For Women, Too",1163894400,"11 19, 2006",2006,1222,"['got', 'chuckle', 'Gilad', 'saying', 'workout', 'was', 'designed', 'just', 'men', 'natural', 'strength', 'abilities', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'Cathe', 'Jari', 'Mindy', 'might', 'have', 'something', 'say', 'forgivable', 'machoism', 'Gilad', 'such', 'cutie', 'very', 'good', 'workout', 'broken', 'down', 'five', 'intervals', 'first', 'interval', '7-minute', 'warm', 'up', 'second', 'interval', '17', 'minutes', 'cardio', 'here', 'Gilad', 'boxing', 'moves', 'including', 'punches', 'jabs', 'skipping', 'rope', 'third', 'interval', '12', 'minutes', 'weights', 'upper', 'body', 'work', 'shoulders', 'chest', 'biceps', 'triceps', 'lower', 'body', 'work', 'mostly', 'fourth', '12-minute', 'interval', 'own', 'body', 'weight', 'push-ups', 'sit-ups', 'back', 'extensions', 'Gilad', 'exercises', 'circuits', 'little', 'variation', 'moves', 'new', 'circuit', 'fifth', 'final', 'circuit', '7-minute', 'cool', 'down', 'Overall', 'was', 'good', 'total-body', 'workout', 'cardio', 'upper', 'body', 'lower', 'body', 'abs', 'nice', 'stretching', 'afterward', 'guys', 'are', '*so', 'cute*', 'when', 'are', 'trying', 'be', 'macho', 'high-fiving', 'growling', 'other', 'end', 'workout', 'one', 'keeper']",Interval Training

He does not like people to get hurt.  I can easily do the 17 minute cardio section.  I still can't do all the pushups in the three different positions - standard, arms wider and hands in a triangle but I am getting there.  This DVD does more reps and more in each set than his other workouts.There is an Upper Body section, Legs, and the floor work is quite different as some exercises are done on the stomach for a good back workout.  My husband did the complete workout at one go but it will take me a few times to get it all so it is a good one for me to aspire to completing.  We have every one of Gilad's workouts and exercise at least 5 times per week, sometimes twice on a weekend day then rest a day.  My husband asserts that this one is his very favorite.  Mine is the Maximum Abs with the Heavy Ball as my waist really shows it and the Step Aerobics - an oldie but goodie.We are off in a few days to the annual Gilad Fitness Adventure Camp/workout for a week on the Big Island of Hawaii and will finally get to meet Gilad in person.",5,This is my husband's favorite Gilad workout!,1401408000,"05 30, 2014",2014,1234,"['husband', 'Gilad', 'men', 'kind', 'think', 'Gilad', 'said', 'motivate', 'women', 'strategy', 'warm', 'up', 'section', 'good', 'are', 'Gilad', 'warm', 'ups', 'not', 'like', 'people', 'get', 'hurt', 'can', 'easily', 'do', '17', 'minute', 'cardio', 'section', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'pushups', 'three', 'different', 'positions', 'standard', 'arms', 'wider', 'hands', 'triangle', 'am', 'getting', 'there', 'DVD', 'more', 'reps', 'more', 'set', 'other', 'Upper', 'Body', 'section', 'Legs', 'floor', 'work', 'quite', 'different', 'exercises', 'are', 'done', 'stomach', 'good', 'back', 'workout', 'husband', 'did', 'complete', 'workout', 'one', 'go', 'will', 'take', 'few', 'times', 'get', 'good', 'one', 'aspire', 'completing', 'have', 'one', 'Gilad', 'workouts', 'exercise', 'least', '5', 'times', 'week', 'sometimes', 'twice', 'weekend', 'day', 'then', 'rest', 'day', 'husband', 'one', 'very', 'favorite', 'Mine', 'Maximum', 'Abs', 'Heavy', 'Ball', 'waist', 'really', 'Step', 'Aerobics', 'oldie', 'goodie.We', 'are', 'off', 'few', 'days', 'annual', 'Gilad', 'Fitness', 'Adventure', 'Camp/workout', 'week', 'Big', 'Island', 'Hawaii', 'will', 'finally', 'get', 'meet', 'Gilad', 'person']",Interval Training

But, truth be told, I figured that meant that it would be more difficult than most workouts, so that's precisely why I tried it. My exercise background: The FIRM, Jillian Michaels (BFBM, NMTZ, Shred), and TaeBo. I am 29, and still have about 15 to 20 lbs to lose. I work out 3 to 6 times a week. This was my first Gilad workout.This workout is excellent! The cardio interval (17 minutes) is fairly intense because you are doing jumprope-type moves much of the time. He provides a few short breaks where you walk in place, and they all came exactly when I needed them. His cuing and form points are excellent, to say the least. I always appreciate when an instructor is reminding me to keep my knees soft and my abs tight (or whatever). He is also very encouraging and motivating, constantly saying, ""Good job."" And, just by looking at Gilad, I can tell that he is enjoying himself!I also liked the crew, too. They were enthusiastic, and I appreciated that this video featured not only a diversity of ethnicities, but ages as well. I love to see various subcultures represented in workout videos. Love it.Beginner modifications are explained and/or demonstrated for many exercises. For the push ups, I started in regular military style, and then just went to my knees when I needed to (the ""beginner"" in the video, of course, did all his push ups on his knees). I HAD NO PROBLEMS keeping up with this workout. None whatsoever. It was excellent, and I completed it in it's entirety!If you're a woman and you're considering this workout, simply ignore the ""For Men"" part. I don't even know why they put that in there. It unnecessarily alienates a whole gender (Hello, marketing geniuses...). This workout is excellent for women and men alike.

I have a three-shelf bookcase full of workout videos and I choose this one because it's a perfect mix of cardio and strength training.  The cardio has a variety including jacks, high knees, marching fast, football drill types, boxing punches, etc.  I love the weight routine, I started out using 5 lb weights with it and I'm using 8 lb and 10 lb now really feel it the next day. Gilad and the rest are a little cheesy at times, but in a funny way ""come on boys, come on guys, come on men"". What I like about Gilad's style is it's just about the exercise, there isn't any filler chatter or gimmicks.

I was a little put off at the beginning when he says it's just for men, but I can say that there was nothing ""just for men"" about the workout. It might be difficult for a woman who is out of shape, but I attend strength training classes (for women) at a gym, and all of his exercises I have done at the gym. And I can say I have a much harder workout at the gym.
