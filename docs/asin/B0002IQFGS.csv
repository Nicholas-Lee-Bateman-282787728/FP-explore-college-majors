835709,A3VUXYHJGL9WWX,B0002IQFGS,"bass boy ""music fan""","[6, 7]","A solid video of Daltrey and Townshend in transition, trying to recover from the emotional, spiritual and physical loss of the greatest bass guitarist on Earth. Not as explosive as ""Live At The Royal Albert Hall"" or ""The Kids Are Alright"" due to the Ox's absence, of course, the new video is a fairly accurate document of the 2002 tour. Yes, Pino is no John, but Pino did an admirable job of not mimicking his predessor. (The Who's second drummer, Kenney Jones, also should be given a high-five for not aping Moon in 1979-1982 and at Live Aid in 1985). And to the guy below who says that Zak ""sucks,"" it's obvious you're not a drummer. Zak doesn't suck at all. He was on fire in Dallas in 2000 with Entwistle. Zak probably reigned in his playing a pinch or two during the filming of the Boston DVD due to a new bassist (Pino) on board for the tour. After all, the Boston gig was pretty early on in the tour schedule. The Who in 2002 was still better than The Stones, although John Entwistle and Keith Moon always will be missed by us long-time fans. I wish they'd release a video of the 2000 Dallas-Reunion Arena show. At least I still have the audio from that stellar show, proving that Zak doesn't stink on the skins.Peace",4,"Really, must people still beat up on The Who again?",1107302400,"02 2, 2005",2005,1224,"['solid', 'video', 'Daltrey', 'Townshend', 'transition', 'trying', 'recover', 'emotional', 'spiritual', 'physical', 'loss', 'greatest', 'bass', 'guitarist', 'Earth', 'Not', 'as', 'explosive', 'Live', 'Royal', 'Albert', 'Hall', 'Kids', 'Are', 'Alright', 'due', 'Ox', 'absence', 'course', 'new', 'video', 'fairly', 'accurate', 'document', '2002', 'tour', 'Yes', 'Pino', 'John', 'Pino', 'did', 'admirable', 'job', 'not', 'mimicking', 'predessor', 'Who', 'second', 'drummer', 'Kenney', 'Jones', 'also', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'high-five', 'not', 'aping', 'Moon', '1979-1982', 'Live', 'Aid', '1985', 'guy', 'who', 'Zak', 'sucks', 'obvious', ""'re"", 'not', 'drummer', 'Zak', ""n't"", 'suck', 'was', 'fire', 'Dallas', '2000', 'Entwistle', 'Zak', 'probably', 'reigned', 'playing', 'pinch', 'two', 'filming', 'Boston', 'DVD', 'due', 'new', 'bassist', 'Pino', 'board', 'tour', 'Boston', 'gig', 'was', 'pretty', 'early', 'tour', 'schedule', 'Who', '2002', 'was', 'still', 'better', 'Stones', 'John', 'Entwistle', 'Keith', 'Moon', 'always', 'will', 'be', 'missed', 'long-time', 'fans', 'wish', ""'d"", 'release', 'video', '2000', 'Dallas-Reunion', 'Arena', 'show', 'least', 'still', 'have', 'audio', 'stellar', 'show', 'proving', 'Zak', ""n't"", 'stink', 'skins.Peace']",N/A

835712,AWWKZOO8PNYXQ,B0002IQFGS,Dean Jarvis,"[4, 4]","It was a difficult decision for Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend to carry on with The Who's 2002 Summer tour after John Entwistle died on the eve of the opener in Las Vegas.  The shows became, in part, a tribute to the late bassist.  Roger and Pete carried on despite their loss of their friend, and the Boston show on this DVD proves that ""The Two"" can still make some powerful music together.I think it'd be a mistake to review this DVD song by song; the concert itself is wonderfully paced and builds momentum as it goes along.  Roger's vocals are quite good, and Pete's guitar playing is inspired.  The rest of the band (John ""Rabbit"" Bundrick on keyboards, Pete's brother Simon on guitar and backing vocals, Pino Palladino on bass and Zak Starkey on drums) are tight.  There are a couple of exchanges between the band and a fan who's getting under Pete's skin; this adds a bit of tension to the air.  For me, the concert's high points are ""My Generation"", ""Amazing Journey"" and ""Sparks"".It would have been nice to have had a video tribute to John on this DVD (there is a series of his drawings presented as a bonus feature), and wide screen would have been nice.  The Who released CDs of this summer tour straight from the sound board in 2002; if you bought one or more of these, you will be pleasantly surprised by the sound quality.  If you're a fan, you won't be disappointed in the concert.",4,Still rockin' after all these years...,1098576000,"10 24, 2004",2004,1399,"['was', 'difficult', 'decision', 'Roger', 'Daltrey', 'Pete', 'Townshend', 'carry', 'Who', '2002', 'Summer', 'tour', 'John', 'Entwistle', 'died', 'eve', 'opener', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'shows', 'became', 'part', 'tribute', 'late', 'bassist', 'Roger', 'Pete', 'carried', 'loss', 'friend', 'Boston', 'show', 'DVD', 'Two', 'can', 'still', 'make', 'powerful', 'music', 'together.I', 'think', ""'d"", 'be', 'mistake', 'review', 'DVD', 'song', 'song', 'concert', 'wonderfully', 'paced', 'builds', 'momentum', 'along', 'Roger', 'vocals', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'Pete', 'guitar', 'playing', 'inspired', 'rest', 'band', 'John', 'Rabbit', 'Bundrick', 'keyboards', 'Pete', 'brother', 'Simon', 'guitar', 'backing', 'vocals', 'Pino', 'Palladino', 'bass', 'Zak', 'Starkey', 'drums', 'are', 'tight', 'are', 'couple', 'exchanges', 'band', 'fan', 'who', 'getting', 'Pete', 'skin', 'bit', 'tension', 'air', 'concert', 'high', 'points', 'are', 'Generation', 'Amazing', 'Journey', 'Sparks', '.It', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'had', 'video', 'tribute', 'John', 'DVD', 'series', 'drawings', 'presented', 'bonus', 'feature', 'wide', 'screen', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'Who', 'released', 'CDs', 'summer', 'tour', 'straight', 'sound', 'board', '2002', 'bought', 'one', 'more', 'will', 'be', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'sound', 'quality', ""'re"", 'fan', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'concert']",N/A

Pino handles the bass lines rather well, especially on the classic solos during ""My Generation.""

Not because the band is not playing well- they are. But every moment is tinged with the sadness of having lost a great friend, and our realization that a wonderful rock and roll personality has been removed from the world. John  Entwistle died from taking cocaine, and by all standards that was a stupid act of selfishness. Leaving his mates in the lurch in the middle of a tour- John, John, John, defintely bad form at best. The pain, the sadness is evident in every closeup, between the songs, and in the music itself. Listen to Townsend's tortured guitar licks and Daltry's strangled singing and you will know this is a group of friends in deep mourning. The music though is fantastic, even though they occasionally get out of synch, particularly Zak Starkey, but it doesn't matter. Anything on this night that might be a mistake is forgiven by their fans, and at times the music soars and reaches the heights seen and heard by Who fans in years past when the sound of The Who roared like a lion in the jungle.
