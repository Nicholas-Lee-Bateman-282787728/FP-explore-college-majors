1472734,A2YW1SOKOLNG2,B005LAIHR2,"Amazon Customer ""Movie Fan""","[4, 7]","It's funny as I look at the reviews of Rock of Ages, both in Amazon and other venues.  I would venture to say anyone who hated it did not grow up in the 80s, and truthfully, the movie primarily meant for that audience, those who were in their teens and early 20s in the late 80s.  Basically, this movie is the soundtrack to my childhood, and that is the feeling it evokes.  I titled a review of this film elsewhere as a glorious celebration of decadence and excess, which is the perfect way to describe the hair metal 80s.  After rock went through its self-important phase (Music for the Elder, BOC, Pink Floyd, David Bowie and Led Zep imagery) and punk phases, they went straight to the self-indulgent phase, and that is what this film so gloriously depicts.  The music is wonderful, but you had to be a hair metal afficionado, and I would say those who hated the film did not like this type of music.  It really is associated with a bygone lifestyle that Cobain and the dirtballs of grunge (although I will admit, I DO like the music) brounght to an ignoble and untimely end.  This hearkens back to a more innocent, or at least less cynical, age when the greatest threat to rock n roll was the PMRC (If you don't know, look it up) and Jerry Falwell.  This is so obviously a charicature on an age that is a caricature of itself.  Tom Cruise is pefectly cast as a rock god so narcissistic, he is almost in love with himself.  Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand are quite funny as the hapless owners of the hottest nightclub on the LA Strip (basically a thinly-veiled reference to the real Whiskey a Go Go) and Catherine Zeta Jones is great as the outraged crusader against the Satanic influence of rock.  Finally Paul Giamatti puts in his regular great performance as the sleazy record company guy.  Everyone is obviously having fun in this pic, and since it is a musical, its heightened unrealness just adds to the charm of a nostalgic look back in time.  If you can't take it tongue firmly planted in cheek, don't bother.  But otherwise, treat yourself.

1472746,A4HQVWV6BZ50H,B005LAIHR2,Ashley Collins,"[0, 2]","If I were able I would probably give this film 3-1/2 stars, but as that's not possible I'll stick with a solid 3. Yes, it's cringeworthy in spots and yes, the hair and costuming is awful at times and yes, it's very cheesy and yes, it's still a damn good time all around. This is what satire is, guys. Face it, when you're making a movie that takes its cues from the music in it (and especially when that music is 80s hair metal), your plot is going to be EXTREMELY corny and pretty predictable. But when you're making a movie that takes its cues from 80s hair metal, it's obviously not all about the plot.The musical numbers in Rock of Ages are performed with so much heart and soul that it makes me think these actors belong on the Broadway stage -- they pour everything into their parts, and that's half of what makes it such great fun. I was extremely impressed with Tom Cruise's vocal work; never knew he could sing like that! And I was so glad to see Catherine Zeta-Jones in a musical again because she's a great all-around performer -- the female Hugh Jackman equivalent without the nasal singing voice. In fact, I really thought the whole cast did well when it came to singing, even Russell Brand and Alec Baldwin (I have a notorious hatred for anything Baldwin does, so this was particularly impressive to me). Their subplot felt a bit rushed, but they played off each other so well that it was hilarious to watch how things unfolded. Russell probably stole the show, if there was anything left to steal after Cruise came through. I'm one of those people who still thinks Tom Cruise is a psycho after the whole jumping-on-Oprah's-couch thing; it made me lose so much respect for him as a professional (not to mention that it seems like a lot of the roles he plays anymore are still reaching for the stars of his Mission Impossible days). But Stacee Jaxx seemed to fit him like a glove -- or perhaps those leather pants. For his age, he's in great shape. And who honestly knew he could sing at all, let alone WELL? Color me impressed. Grudgingly so, but impressed.The downfall in my eyes is the choreography. I don't go into movie musicals expecting a whole lot, but I do like to see solid choreography. The dance moves were so boring, and knowing that someone as renowned as Mia Michaels was the choreographer, I couldn't help but be disappointed there.

Well... admittedly it was pretty rough viewing material for the first hour- nothing really memorable occurs other than the music being performed of course.  But from a storyline point of view the first hour is pretty lackluster.The truth is however, if you love 80's rock -especially the hair metal movement- you will unquestionably admire what Rock of Ages presents.  A few flaws appear occasionally such as everything Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand do together- horrendous writing that I don't even need to comment on, haha.  I like how the women -especially Julianne Hough and Catherine Zeta-Jones- are INCREDIBLY attractive!Perhaps a little heavy on the Foreigner material, though the trading back and forth of ""Juke Box Hero"" and Joan Jets ""I Love Rock 'n Roll"" is a nice addition.  As is ""I Want to Know What Love Is"" starring Tom Cruise resembling Alice Cooper both personality and appearance-wise.  I imagine that's completely unintentional but I could be wrong.  A lot of the stuff in between all the singing and dancing is total fluff however, especially during the first hour.  It's not really a consistently compelling musical which separates it from, say, Grease.  Yes I know- Grease was released in the 70's and features an entirely different type of rock, but the singing and dancing is why I'm mainly comparing the two here.Catherine Zeta-Jones plays the role of a leader protesting a movement against all the negatives associated with rock music.  This is a highlight.  However there's a couple lows that make me drag the overall rating down 1 star.  First, the boy band segment later on.  One of the rock stars (played by Diego Boneta) eventually sells out and joins a rock band.  This stuff has no real reason to be included in a movie that should most certainly be centered around rock and roll.  And the presence of a pet baboon is awkward and unnecessary.Besides Foreigner, if you like Poison, Def Leppard, Guns 'n Roses, Journey, Pat Benatar and REO Speedwagon in particular, you can expect these bands to dominate the majority of hair metal acts featured in Rock of Ages.  Somewhat limited with just these selections I believe since the 80's presented a LOT more depth than this, but there you have it.  Also, I was inclined to think Rock of Ages would focus more on the heavier metal acts judging by the commercials, but not so much.A good musica, some creative singing and dancing with a few songs (Pat Benatar's ""Shadows of the Night"" and ""Hit Me With Your Best Shot"" being highlights from a creative perspective) but expect the stuff in between the singing and dancing to feel tacky and sometimes boring.",4,rock it down,1363996800,"03 23, 2013",2013,2670,"['Rock', 'Ages', 'fantastic', 'musical', 'Well', 'admittedly', 'was', 'pretty', 'rough', 'viewing', 'material', 'first', 'hour-', 'nothing', 'really', 'memorable', 'other', 'music', 'being', 'performed', 'course', 'storyline', 'point', 'view', 'first', 'hour', 'pretty', 'lackluster.The', 'truth', 'however', 'love', '80', 'rock', '-especially', 'hair', 'metal', 'movement-', 'will', 'unquestionably', 'admire', 'what', 'Rock', 'Ages', 'presents', 'few', 'flaws', 'appear', 'occasionally', 'such', 'everything', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Russell', 'Brand', 'do', 'together-', 'horrendous', 'writing', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'need', 'comment', 'haha', 'how', 'women', '-especially', 'Julianne', 'Hough', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones-', 'are', 'INCREDIBLY', 'attractive', 'Perhaps', 'little', 'heavy', 'Foreigner', 'material', 'trading', 'back', 'forth', 'Juke', 'Box', 'Hero', 'Joan', 'Jets', 'Love', 'Rock', 'n', 'Roll', 'nice', 'addition', 'Want', 'Know', 'What', 'Love', 'starring', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'resembling', 'Alice', 'Cooper', 'personality', 'appearance-wise', 'imagine', 'completely', 'unintentional', 'could', 'be', 'wrong', 'lot', 'stuff', 'singing', 'dancing', 'total', 'fluff', 'however', 'especially', 'first', 'hour', 'not', 'really', 'consistently', 'compelling', 'musical', 'say', 'Grease', 'Yes', 'know-', 'Grease', 'was', 'released', '70', 'entirely', 'different', 'type', 'rock', 'singing', 'dancing', 'why', ""'m"", 'mainly', 'comparing', 'two', 'here.Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'role', 'leader', 'protesting', 'movement', 'negatives', 'associated', 'rock', 'music', 'highlight', 'However', 'couple', 'make', 'drag', 'overall', 'rating', 'down', '1', 'star', 'First', 'boy', 'band', 'segment', 'later', 'One', 'rock', 'stars', 'played', 'Diego', 'Boneta', 'eventually', 'out', 'rock', 'band', 'stuff', 'real', 'reason', 'be', 'included', 'movie', 'should', 'most', 'certainly', 'be', 'centered', 'rock', 'roll', 'presence', 'pet', 'baboon', 'awkward', 'unnecessary.Besides', 'Foreigner', 'like', 'Poison', 'Def', 'Leppard', 'Guns', 'n', 'Roses', 'Journey', 'Pat', 'Benatar', 'REO', 'Speedwagon', 'particular', 'can', 'expect', 'bands', 'dominate', 'majority', 'hair', 'metal', 'acts', 'featured', 'Rock', 'Ages', 'Somewhat', 'limited', 'just', 'selections', 'believe', '80', 'presented', 'LOT', 'more', 'depth', 'there', 'have', 'Also', 'was', 'inclined', 'think', 'Rock', 'Ages', 'would', 'focus', 'more', 'heavier', 'metal', 'acts', 'judging', 'commercials', 'not', 'so', 'much.A', 'good', 'musica', 'creative', 'singing', 'dancing', 'few', 'songs', 'Pat', 'Benatar', 'Shadows', 'Night', 'Hit', 'Me', 'Your', 'Best', 'Shot', 'being', 'highlights', 'creative', 'perspective', 'expect', 'stuff', 'singing', 'dancing', 'feel', 'tacky', 'sometimes', 'boring']",N/A

1472767,A3I7YI4NMP6SV8,B005LAIHR2,"B. Wells ""CineMan""","[21, 30]","There seemed to be a certain amount of gloating in some of today's entertainment headlines as they branded Tom Cruise's latest movie a bomb.  Of course, that seems to be the way the media (and by extension, the public) handles our idols: build them up to impossible heights and then pull the rug out from under them and watch them fall.  It's a vicious game, but one that's been played out for as long as there have been celebrities, chroniclers, and an adoring public to worship both.That being said, ""Rock of Ages"", which opened on Friday, is far from being Tom Cruise's best movie, or even a very good movie, for that matter.  It's not even really a ""Tom Cruise"" movie, although his character is one of several whose lives revolve around a glitzy rock nightclub on the Sunset Strip in the 1980's.  But, for all its shortcomings, what ""Rock of Ages"" manages to be is highly entertaining, in a campy, big hair, over-the-top sort of way, kind of like the illegitimate offspring of ""Hairspray"" and ""This Is Spinal Tap"" by way of Broadway (where it actually played).  Set against a soundtrack of Journey, Def Leppard, Poison, and a host of other 80's bands, ""Rock of Ages"" attempts to tell the story of Sherrie, an Oklahoma girl who heads to L.A. to find a new life.  Stepping off the bus with $17 in her purse, Sherrie meets a bar back named Drew, who works at the famous Bourbon nightclub and aspires to be a rock god like his idol, Stacee Jaxx.  After a thief steals Sherrie's belongings (including her record collection), Drew manages to get her a job at the Bourbon, ruled by aging hippie, Dennis Dupree, and his emcee/right arm, Lonny.  Dennis and Lonny have their own problems with the mayor  and his ultra-conservative wife who are trying to close the club for unpaid taxes, but soon they see salvation when no less than Stacee Jaxx, himself, agrees to perform at the club for free!There's a slight love story between Sherrie and Drew but it gets lost in the big time rutting of Stacee Jax and the rock and roll crowd hanging around the club; and soon enough, there's a conflict that drives our young lovers apart, but do we care?  Of course not!  It's too much fun watching Tom Cruise puff out his chest and suck in his gut while strutting around uttering profound banalities in the role of rock god, Stacee Jaxx.  Cruise has often been a good actor in films and, at times, he's even great.  But, here he is guzzling booze, hamming it up in leather chaps and a glittery jockstrap, a cowboy hat and bandana, and having a grand old time, in much the same way that William Shatner was able to do when he successfully redeemed his career as Denny Crane in television's ""Boston Legal"".  Cruise is a hoot, and the screen is electric when he's on it.  He evens sounds like a rock star during his big numbers.Also a lot of fun to watch is Alec Baldwin, as the Bourbon's proprietor, Dennis, a seen-it-all, heard-it-all type who looks like a sausage with long hair stuffed into his laid back rocker/hippie attire.  Ditto for comedian Russell Banks, who plays Lonny with a certain degree of panache.  The young lovers--""Dancing With the Stars"" Julianne Hough and newcomer Diego Boneta--do their best but are completely overshadowed by performances of the big-name cast.  That their romance is so blandly portrayed doesn't help matters, nor does the fact that Julianne Hough's voice is too wispy to belt out the heavier numbers required of her.  I was also rather disappointed in Catherine Zeta Jones, too seldom seen onscreen these days since her dynamic performance more than ten years ago in ""Chicago"".  Zeta Jones is an accomplished comedienne, as well as a decent singer and dancer, but she really seemed sort of wasted in the role of the mayor's holier-than-thou wife.  Bryan Cranston, Mary J. Blige and Malin Akerman do very well in smaller roles that are crucial to the script, and Paul Giamatti is realistically oozy as an unscrupulous band manager.  And just for good measure, there's a pet ape--I'm not sure what kind--who is genuinely amusing.If you weren't a fan of the Big Hair Bands of the `80's chances are you're probably not going to much like ""Rock of Ages"".  It's slight, silly, affectionate, overlong, often funny, excessive, sexy, and big-budgeted, a fun, if forgettable, tribute to an over-the-top era.",3,Tom Cruise Gets Rowdy!,1339891200,"06 17, 2012",2012,4320,"['seemed', 'be', 'certain', 'amount', 'gloating', 'today', 'entertainment', 'headlines', 'branded', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'latest', 'movie', 'bomb', 'course', 'be', 'way', 'media', 'extension', 'public', 'idols', 'build', 'up', 'impossible', 'heights', 'then', 'pull', 'rug', 'watch', 'fall', 'vicious', 'game', 'one', 'been', 'played', 'out', 'as', 'long', 'have', 'been', 'celebrities', 'chroniclers', 'adoring', 'public', 'worship', 'being', 'said', 'Rock', 'Ages', 'opened', 'Friday', 'far', 'being', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'best', 'movie', 'even', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'matter', 'not', 'even', 'really', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'movie', 'character', 'one', 'several', 'lives', 'revolve', 'glitzy', 'rock', 'nightclub', 'Sunset', 'Strip', '1980', 'shortcomings', 'what', 'Rock', 'Ages', 'be', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'campy', 'big', 'hair', 'over-the-top', 'sort', 'way', 'kind', 'illegitimate', 'offspring', 'Hairspray', 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'way', 'Broadway', 'where', 'actually', 'played', 'Set', 'soundtrack', 'Journey', 'Def', 'Leppard', 'Poison', 'host', 'other', '80', 'bands', 'Rock', 'Ages', 'attempts', 'tell', 'story', 'Sherrie', 'Oklahoma', 'girl', 'who', 'L.A.', 'find', 'new', 'life', 'Stepping', 'off', 'bus', '17', 'purse', 'Sherrie', 'bar', 'back', 'named', 'Drew', 'who', 'famous', 'Bourbon', 'nightclub', 'aspires', 'be', 'rock', 'god', 'idol', 'Stacee', 'Jaxx', 'thief', 'Sherrie', 'belongings', 'including', 'record', 'collection', 'Drew', 'get', 'job', 'Bourbon', 'ruled', 'aging', 'hippie', 'Dennis', 'Dupree', 'emcee/right', 'arm', 'Lonny', 'Dennis', 'Lonny', 'have', 'own', 'problems', 'mayor', 'ultra-conservative', 'wife', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'close', 'club', 'unpaid', 'taxes', 'soon', 'see', 'salvation', 'when', 'less', 'Stacee', 'Jaxx', 'perform', 'club', 'free', 'slight', 'love', 'story', 'Sherrie', 'Drew', 'lost', 'big', 'time', 'rutting', 'Stacee', 'Jax', 'rock', 'roll', 'crowd', 'hanging', 'club', 'soon', 'enough', 'conflict', 'young', 'lovers', 'apart', 'do', 'care', 'course', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'fun', 'watching', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'puff', 'chest', 'suck', 'gut', 'strutting', 'uttering', 'profound', 'banalities', 'role', 'rock', 'god', 'Stacee', 'Jaxx', 'Cruise', 'often', 'been', 'good', 'actor', 'films', 'times', 'even', 'great', 'here', 'guzzling', 'booze', 'hamming', 'up', 'leather', 'chaps', 'glittery', 'jockstrap', 'cowboy', 'hat', 'bandana', 'having', 'grand', 'old', 'time', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'William', 'Shatner', 'was', 'able', 'do', 'when', 'successfully', 'redeemed', 'career', 'Denny', 'Crane', 'television', 'Boston', 'Legal', 'Cruise', 'hoot', 'screen', 'electric', 'when', 'rock', 'star', 'big', 'numbers.Also', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Bourbon', 'proprietor', 'Dennis', 'seen-it-all', 'heard-it-all', 'type', 'who', 'sausage', 'long', 'hair', 'stuffed', 'laid', 'back', 'rocker/hippie', 'attire', 'Ditto', 'comedian', 'Russell', 'Banks', 'who', 'Lonny', 'certain', 'degree', 'panache', 'young', 'lovers', 'Dancing', 'Stars', 'Julianne', 'Hough', 'newcomer', 'Diego', 'Boneta', 'do', 'best', 'are', 'completely', 'overshadowed', 'performances', 'big-name', 'cast', 'romance', 'so', 'blandly', 'portrayed', ""n't"", 'help', 'matters', 'fact', 'Julianne', 'Hough', 'voice', 'too', 'wispy', 'belt', 'out', 'heavier', 'numbers', 'required', 'was', 'also', 'rather', 'disappointed', 'Catherine', 'Zeta', 'Jones', 'too', 'seldom', 'seen', 'onscreen', 'days', 'dynamic', 'performance', 'more', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'Chicago', 'Zeta', 'Jones', 'accomplished', 'comedienne', 'as', 'well', 'decent', 'singer', 'dancer', 'really', 'seemed', 'sort', 'wasted', 'role', 'mayor', 'holier-than-thou', 'wife', 'Bryan', 'Cranston', 'Mary', 'J.', 'Blige', 'Malin', 'Akerman', 'do', 'very', 'well', 'smaller', 'roles', 'are', 'crucial', 'script', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'realistically', 'oozy', 'unscrupulous', 'band', 'manager', 'just', 'good', 'measure', 'pet', 'ape', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'kind', 'who', 'genuinely', 'amusing.If', 'were', ""n't"", 'fan', 'Big', 'Hair', 'Bands', '80', 'chances', 'are', ""'re"", 'probably', 'not', 'going', 'much', 'Rock', 'Ages', 'slight', 'silly', 'affectionate', 'overlong', 'often', 'funny', 'excessive', 'sexy', 'big-budgeted', 'fun', 'forgettable', 'tribute', 'over-the-top', 'era']",N/A

1472770,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B005LAIHR2,California Dreaming,"[1, 4]","Supposedly, Julianne Hough was dating Ryan Seacrest until 2013.  That seems about right; he would have just finished watching &#34;Rock of Ages&#34; and decided that it was probably time to move on.OK; so that was a cheap joke, and perhaps even an ad hominem.  But there probably is some truth to it.  And to be completely truthful, I maybe just made it out of the first act of this rock-and-roll flop and decided to write a review.  In general, I wait until the credits roll to start writing, but in this case, I don't need to.The film opens with Ms. Hough riding a bus, presumably in search of a city where she can become a rock and roll star.  She starts singing &#34;Sister Christian,&#34; and I had to laugh; I know someone who hates that song so much that she gets mad when she hears it.  Personally, I am not a fan of &#34;Sister Christian&#34; either, but it doesn't make me want to puke.  But it does make me cringe.And what might make you cringe:  watching the rest of the people on the bus join in singing with Ms. Hough on this song-that-never-should-have-been.  Ugh.  And what I immediately thought:  wow, this is just like &#34;Glee,&#34; but with bad singers and a total lack of humor.  And I also thought that, while Ms. Hough is surely not a terrible singer -- she actually isn't half bad -- she's like Lea Michelle, if you took Ms. Michelle on the worst of days and gave her a really bad cold.  (To be fair, I think that Ms. Michelle is a unique talent so this isn't as much of a &#34;dis&#34; as one might think.)But the tone of this musical-gone-wrong is all wrong itself.  It just doesn't feel right to me, and I should know; I was a metal head in the late 70s and early 80s.  It's as if they're trying to make a bunch of old hard-core rock-and-rollers &#34;Happy Happy,&#34; and that's just not their schtick.  Rock and roll guys are coolest when they're just plain mean.  And I cringed some more when I saw that Tom Cruise is in this thing, and they obviously stole some elements from &#34;Cocktail&#34; here at the beginning of the second act.I may come back, after watching this film in its entirety, and change my review.  But I don't think so.  It's such schlock at the start that I'm sure that it will never recover.

There has been such an amazing variety and now we have a Rock-N-Roll Musical amongst the superheroes, aliens and action stars.""Rock of Ages"" is an adaption of a Broadway rock comedy musical that debuted as on off-Broadway production in 2008 but made its debut in Los Angeles 2005. Constantine Maroulis of American Idol fame played the lead character, Drew Boley, in the Broadway production and has a cameo role in the film. Diego Boneta takes on that role in the film. He is probably one of the lesser known of the cast that includes Julianne Hough, Russell Brand, Alec Baldwin, Mary J. Blige, Catherine Zeta Jones, Malin Ackerman and Tom Cruise as legendary rock god Stacee Jaxx, a role without question inspired by Guns-N-Roses front man Axel Rose.The movie and the play are set back in the late 80's when Rock-N-Roll was decadent and king. Dennis Dupree (Baldwin), owns the rock club The Bourbon Room that I can only assume is based on the real rock club The Whiskey in Los Angeles. Sherrie Christian (Hough) is an Oklahoma girl who takes the bus to Los Angeles to pursue her Hollywood dreams. Stacee Jaxx (Cruise) is a legendary rock star who is lost in a sea of scotch, decadence and his own persona. Drew Boley (Boneta) is a bartender who is a rising star. All of these characters come together to form the story.There is nothing unique about the storyline to the film. All of the stories that mold together are pretty clich&eacute; and predictable. The romances that form and the dilemma's faced and dealt with have been seen and done before. Yet, the truth is, the movie isn't about the stories that are formed during the course of the movie by the actors. The movie is a love affair with a Rock-N-Roll age that ruled in the late 80's and has since been forgotten in an age of boy bands, studio-enhanced albums and conformity.""Rock of Ages"" is a homage to the decadence and freedom of Rock-N-Roll. Stacee Jaxx (Tom Cruise) embodies all of the things that defined a generation of rock stars and also make complete fun of it. The movie is fun, hilarious and had a guy like me, who graduated high school the very year that this movie takes place in, grinning throughout, remembering all of it and inside my head, singing along with all the unforgettable songs.""Rock of Ages"" is similar in style to the television show ""Glee"", but with all of the seediness and debauchery of an age of music that got lost in the shuffle somewhere.",4,"Celebrity Karaoke?

Most of the things that were cut were Julianne Hough's dance numbers, which is odd because she is a better dancer than a singer. I guess the dancing was a little too racy for test audiences so they pulled it but I thought they were fun to watch and added more layers.All in all its alot of fun, takes you back to big hair bands and spandex, and how can you not get reminiscent when you see Tower Records!Great performance by Tom Cruise too, I love when he takes on a role that pushes the boundaries of him just being himself.

For instance: I hate the Les miserables (musical) because... C'mon... who the hell sings his or her heart out in the middle of a firefight? it just looks ridiculous!On the other hand... A cynical piece full of sexy singing women like Chicago... what is not to like?I thought Rock of Ages was going to be something similar sexy chicks singing 80s glam hits... After all... look at the posters!I WAS TERRIBLY, TERRIBLY MISTAKENYes, there are three beutiful sexy girls in the ensamble cast, but they sing the worst tunes of the 80s, the script for the movie is just... just lazy and the acting is... somehow (i really do not know how) worst!Naive girl comes to the city with rock dreams in her head during the glam california era, she gets to work in the hottest club in town and meets a ""rock god"" that spawned from that particular club while romancing another employee of the club who is, obviously, also a talented underapreciated aspiring ""rock god""... Enter the cruel evil manager that tries to manipulate them all and... well you can fill in the blanks without even watching.It is expected for the plot to be lame, but I sincerly thought this was a love piece for the  Montley Crues and Poisons and (dare I say it?) Warrants of the time... Instead we are stuck with... Journey?????? Ok, maybe I was to young to remember the 80s properly but Steve Perry dont come to mind when I think about the glam rockers of the time.  I know this is a brodway musical and probably the music selection came from there but... C'mon... They could have changed it to actually be relatable to... I don't know... Rock fans?

And of course after the mandatory fifteen lines of dialogue the duo suddenly bursts into song (Hough and Boneta do have some serious pipes, and it was good to hear several cover songs from long ago, yet the onslaught of the music rings numbingly hollow).  Meanwhile a tavern that launched so many musical careers (via its proprietor, played by Alec Baldwin, and his assistant, played by Russell Brand) teeters on the brink of economic collapse. . .unless it can convince former prot&eacute;g&eacute;e-turned-rock-legend Stacee Jaxx (a bored looking Tom Cruise) to perform onstage.  The luring of Jaxx brings about the vigorous opposition from a group bent on curtailing Jaxx's demonic brand of music, a group led by the mayor's wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones).  All the various subplots come (so predictably) together, culminating in the performance of a song composed by the Boneta character himself--an instant hit and chart topper.Yet ROCK OF AGES never gains footing or momentum; the two supposed leads can't carry the freight, the Jaxx character is unlikable, the subplot surrounding the budding romance between the Baldwin and Brand characters unbelievable as well as damaging to digestion.  We all know how the Zeta-Jones character will evolve, with a collective yawn pertaining to the boy-meets-girl/loses-girl/reunites-with-girl predictable story, strongly signifying why ROCK OF AGES made its theatrical run with much prior fanfare, then limped to DVD status with a glossy haired whimper.--D.

Bristol ""bibliophile""","[1, 3]","Julianne Hough (co-star of last year's ""Footloose"") plays a fresh-faced small town girl who puts her motor in and goes to the big city to find love.  Arriving there, she's befriended by Diego Bonata, a young hottie with aspirations as a singer/songwriter/rock star, who gets her a job as a waitress at the Bourbon Club.  Tom Cruise comes out of hibernation to play Stacee Jaxx, a rock legend whose reputation is eclipsed only by his ego.  Cruise is good, but at times seems to be in a different movie: his demeanor stays smolderingly dour, while everyone else's is resolutely chipper.  Alec Baldwin plays the owner of the on-the-skids Bourbon Club, which gave Stacee his first break, and Russell Brand plays himself (at which he is rather good).  Paul Giamatti plays  Stacee's slimy manager, and the other bad guy is Catherine Zeta-Jones, a Tipper Gore-like figure, who is leading a protest against music that ""rapes"" today's youngsters.  In the end, of course, the power of rock and roll proves the ultimate healer and unites friend and foe alike.""Rock of Ages,"" is an equal opportunity offender; its targets include feminists, homophobes, and people with discerning musical taste.  Based on a musical, it does have very important messages about censorship, following your dream despite discouragement, etc., but they aren't hammered home, and you can just enjoy the music, and snicker at the Tonka Truck sized cells, abundance of acid wash and mousse abuse.  Mary J. Blige has a small role, too, and seems to be enjoying herself, although after hearing her, it's too bad that she's too old to play the Hough role.

The acting is top-notch and the songs are really good. My favourite songs are Paradise City (played in its entireity during the end credits), Sister Christian, I Want To Know What Love Is, Pour Some Sugar On Me, Any Way You Want It and Rock You Like A Hurricane (cut from the film, but partially heard during the latter portion of the end credits), Every Rose Has Its Thorn and Don't Stop Believin'. The choreography is outstanding. Tom Cruise literally disappears into the role, becoming Stacee Jaxx.Biblically speaking, there's no actual nudity, but very suggestive dancing and sensual scenes take place throughout. Stacee's entrance in the film is particularly telling of the sexual content. There's also some mild-to-moderate profanity, with one use of the f-word, but thankfully, no profaning of God's Name (ie. combination of His Name with a mild curse word), and a kiss between two men at the end of a beautiful song by REO Speedwagon, which I think was poorly used here. I lowered my eyes when they were about to kiss, so I didn't see that part. I don't see why film-makers feel the need to insert the aforementioned erotic element between two men in a movie. Just implying it the way they did during the song was enough, in my opinion. That is taking something that God designed to be between a woman and a man & perverting it. God calleth that an abomination.With a caution about the heavy sexual content, I recommend this movie.Rated PG-13 (heavy sexual content throughout including suggestive dancing, some language, drinking and brief violence).",5,Terrific Movie.

Lord, those were great times!!!  I had heard so many negative things about this movie that I didn't go to the theater to see it.  I primarily bought it when it came out on dvd because I DO love 80's music, brings back sooo many great memories.  I really had no high expectations where this movie was concerned, and I must admit I was curious how Tom Cruise would carry off the part of a Rock Star.  His character's look intrigued me enough that I thought, what the heck, I'll get the damn movie.  If it stinks, I can always donate it!If you're expecting something along the lines of ""South Pacific"", ""Oklahoma"" or even ""Chicago"", keep looking, because this movie isn't it.  The story's been told before many times.  Small town girl heads to L.A. with stars in her eyes and big dreams in her head.  She loses her record collection, finds a job, loses her innocence, finds love, loses love, finds it again, etc., etc.  The Bourbon Club is under the threat of being shut down by religious fanatics for playing devil music, etc., etc.  It's the ol' overcoming challenges type of movie.  There is not a lot of substance to it.  But, you know what?.... That's OK, because this movie is so much FUN to watch!  I LOVED it for that reason alone.I can take or leave Tom Cruise.  He's made some outstanding movies, but that's because they were really good movies, i.e., good plot, good cast, good special F/X, etc.  I was sooo riveted watching his performance as Stacee Jaxx.  He nailed it!  He was amazing.  I saw a sexuality to him I didn't think existed and I was blown away.  I didn't ""see"" Tom Cruise, I saw an aging rock star in an alcohol induced haze trying hard to stay on top.  His singing was actually quite good and he moved and danced around on stage as though he were an actual rock star putting on a concert.  He impressed the hell out of me in this movie.While not a huge Alec Baldwin or Russell Brand fan, these two were delightful to watch as Dennis, the owner of The Bourbon and his right hand man Lonny.  Their duet is priceless!!  Who knew Alec Baldwin could sing?  Very passable.  The rest of the cast turned in laudable performances as well, Julianne Hough, Diego Boneta, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Paul Giamatti, Mary J. Blige.  Some of the songs were a blend of two different popular 80's songs sung at the same time, and and they were fabulous pairings. I really enjoyed ""dueling"" songs.You know every song that's being sung, hell, you'll sing right along with them.  Come on, admit it, you even remember all of the air guitar riffs and licks, and the awesome air drum solos to all these songs! Because I do.  I think my husband thought I was having seizures at first due to my antics, but when he was assured that I did not in fact require medical attention, he sat down and enjoyed the movie too.  So, watch this movie for the sheer enjoyment of what's on the screen and the pleasurable walk down memory lane.  Watch it strictly for entertainment purposes only.  DO NOT try to find any deep, thought provoking, life changing or profound storytelling here, you'll be sadly disappointed.  So, park your brain at the door, crank up the volume, sing along, and just enjoy!It's a guilty pleasure, so ROCK ON!!!

1472844,AIO247KHD2O40,B005LAIHR2,James N Simpson,"[2, 2]","Rock of Ages is simply a lot of fun! Possibly it helps if you were a child in the 80s like me or were older to appreciate the music even more and just relive decent music again, and throw in the whole nostalgia factor too. I also can't imagine younger audiences who have embraced the TV show Glee and various karaoke style reality TV shows like no generation before with unknowns singing cover songs of classic songs won't love this too. There is no great detailed storyline in the plot, it's simply your basic girl who is a big fish in a small pond moves to the big city and bright lights where it isn't as simple to achieve her dreams as she thought. Nice city guy with similar dreams who's been working hard to make it himself and becomes interested in her, then throw in unethical evil type manager of big star whose let fame go to his head and doesn't want his cash cow put back on track no matter how it is obviously affecting that stars longevity.  Sure those story threads have been done time and time again but the actors in Rock of Ages do it again nicely.  Like with Glee and musicals turned into movies, yes you can tell they are lip syncing to studio recorded songs at times, maybe even more so than most in this one, but you've got to remember the original artists of the songs they are singing cover versions of, had obvious cheesy lip syncing going as well in the original song film clips so it is sort of paying homage to them in some way.  The actors do a pretty good job too (so much so that I bought the soundtrack), sure they might not do as good a job as the original artist in the 80s, and even sing the songs differently such as the way Stacee Jaxx (Tom Cruise) sang Dead or Alive as a duet with Sherrie (Julianne Hough).  But I like that sort of thing, if you want it exactly the same you might as well just play the original artists and have them lip sync over that.I must admit I was hesitant that Tom Cruise could one pass as young enough to be an 80s lead singer in a rock band, but he does pull the look of an almost washed up rock star well.  I also had concerns if he and others such as Baldwin, Brand and Jones could sing at all let alone good enough to do the classic songs of Guns N Roses, Def Leppard, Bon Jovi and others that I was a favourite of well.  But he/they all do a great job, as I said good enough that I bought the soundtrack. I mean on the DVD you have a special feature called Def Leppard: Live At The Premiere which is basically that band playing Pour Some Sugar on Me on the red carpet.  Cruise had way more enthusiasm than the ageing Joe Elliot with the intro Hugh! line to the song in fact the whole song was done better. Granted Def Leppard aren't in their prime anymore (and I was a big fan of these guys) but I think critics of Cruise's performance should watch Jaxx's performance of Pour Some Sugar on me back to back with the DVD extra before passing judgement.I had never heard of Julianne Hough or Diego Boneta who are the two main characters the plot revolves around but both did a great job in both singing and acting.  Julianne being smoking hot, as was the reporter and some characters didn't harm the whole enjoyment of watching factor either.Visit Florida tourism commercial was a bit out of place as an extra, would have preferred to see something else on the DVD but I guess maybe they sponsored or were in investor in the film or something.But definitely get this DVD, it's a lot of fun and a nice nostalgic trip for the two hours or so duration!",5,A Lot of Fun!

On a whim, I decided to rent it. And I'm really glad I did! I was drawn in just from the opening number, and it held me from there. Sure...it's a lot of 80s cheese and big hair...but if you enjoy the music from this era, and aren't looking for anything deep...you'll probably really enjoy this one. Some of the rock mixes were great. I loved how they combined some of the songs. All of the actors just looked like they were having a blast as well.My only complaint is that I wish it had a LITTLE less of of the very clearly inferred sex (just the way it was done was really in your face), because I would have loved to share this with my 13 year old daughter who is super into music too. I get that the whole premise was rock and roll and sex...but when they several times have characters whipping down their pants, a chick spanking a man bent over a table, another one looking like she is...ahhh...kneeling in front of Tom Cruise's character, and more...it was kind of on the edge for PG13. The main female character ends up being an exotic dancer..yet even those (several) scenes were less in your face (and they had plenty of pole dancing) than some of the other scenes. Again, I do get why it was there..just a side mention of wishing maybe there wasn't quite so much and instead it would have been all the music to make it a tad more family friendly. Since it would be a fun movie to share with your kids to show them what we grew up with, music-wise. I thought the male lead actually had a really good voice, Tom Cruise did a great job, as did Alec Baldwin. I enjoyed the female character (Sherri) for the most part...her voice got on my nerves every once in a while.But...bottom line, if you enjoy 80s music and want a no-brainer, don't expect anything at all deep, just fun hour and a half--give it a try.

1472872,AYVQMWDUSGL2C,B005LAIHR2,jude pepper,"[1, 2]","i try to cut the critics some slack, i really do. it is a fact, after all, that less than 10% of all movies are worth the bother, and less than 10% of those are what we call masterpieces. so it's not hard to see how someone who has to see every single movie in the world might get a little jaded. also, to their credit, it's not as if they EXCLUSIVELY piss on the fun movies and sing the praises of the boring or pointless ones.but you still have to wonder about 'em. there are times when it almost seems as if they take pains to duck when they see the point coming. no one will ever mistake ROCK OF AGES for any sort of sojurn into the deeper issues or Henry Jamesian personal odyssey, but it was still lamblasted out the wazoo for failing to do so. that's sort of like criticizing Alfred Hitchcock for being a lousy skeet-shooter. so i'm glad i got the chance to write a more realistic review based on what the damn thing actually IS.the story is admittedly straight off the rack, with it's fair share of cliches and stretchy contrivances, but is that really such a kiss of death? can you seriously tell me that you never enjoyed a movie despite recognizing it plot structure from somewhere else? not only does ROCK OF AGES not suffer for it, that's actually one of the more charming things about it. the plot is the sort of boy-meets-girl-boy-and-girl-deal-with-crisis scenario seen in such musicals as STATE FAIR and so many Fred Astair/Ginger Rogers movies. so it's actually a pretty old-fashioned yarn, really. (i daresay there are those of my generation (and a few others) who'll see this and then finally have some idea where the magic was in those Astaire/Rogers flicks.)if you can't be sold into going along for the ride on story terms, maybe the dynamite cast will sway you. this is as finely cast a movie as any i've ever seen. Julianne Hough and Diego Boneta take the usually thanklessly bland love interests and pump some life into a case of admittedly limited writing. villians are privided by Paul Giammati's cold-blooded manager and Catherine Zeta-Jones' eerie caricature of Tipper Gore. (why am i not surprised that she can play a bitch?) Mary J. Blige, in the role of a heartbroken Julianne's mentor, is the sexiest variation on Yoda you'll ever see. comic relief (with a little Greek chorus thrown in for texture) is provided by Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand as co-owners of The Bourbon Room. (based on The Whiskey-A-Go-Go, for the hopelessly obtuse.) and of course the most heralded performance is that off Tom Cruise. his take on the aging, blitzed out rock icon is dead-on SPINAL TAP. this is the most interesting character he's had since A FEW GOOD MEN.if you're not sold yet, how about the fact that it utilizes quite a few of the very awesomest songs ever? i'm not big on Guns & Roses, so i wouldn't miss ""Paradise City,"" and i could also live without the medley of two of the most overrated songs of all time, ""More Than Words"" and ""Heaven."" but for the most part the soundtrack does indeed literally ""rock."" Tom Cruise's impassioned take on ""Wanted Dead Or Alive"" is more Bon Jovi than Bon Jovi. ""Jukebox Hero""/""I Love Rock & Roll"" and ""Sister Christian""/""Just Like Paradise""/""Nothin' But A Good Time"" make for surprisingly seamless medleys. heartfelt ballads like ""Harden My Heart,"" ""I Want To Know What Love Is,"" and ""Every Rose Has It's Thorn"" give nice meaty roles to a few larynxes. (wait'll you see what Baldwin and Brand do with ""Can't Fight This Feeling!!"") and if you're not driven to leap to your feet by the rousing curtain-call take on ""Don't Stop Believin',"" then you're either tone-deaf or just plain deaf.so to summarize, i guess it's one of those films where ya either get it or ya don't. a film critic named Pauline Kael once said something about how movies were more often ""great trash"" than great art. i personally like to think there are few more levels than that, but it's still nice to see it acknowledge for The Official Record that a film can fall short of Art but still have something to offer. i go on The Record as saying that this is not simply for us rock enthusiasts. anyone who enjoys the art of storytelling can appreciate this film if they'll just adjust their mind to the proper frame. although i do have a sneaking suspicion it's destined to be a ""cult"" classic rather than a mainstream one. oh well.",5,"don't need nothin' but a good time, so

I'm an 80's kid so, I guess it really speaks to me, but, besides that, the movie just has this energy that pulsates off the screen.Like with all musicals, especially cheesy ones like this, there are some songs I like, and some I don't.But Tom Cruise is wonderful as Stacee Jaxx, the aging heavy metal rock star. I also think the Rolling Stone reporter he falls in love with is absoluetly stunning. I just love her Glenn Close, Fatal Attraction, hair! God, she's hot!Her duet, with Cruise ('I want to know what love is') is so campy, sexy and fun that it hurts! The first time I saw it, I thought it was okay, and rather corny, but the second time, it really grew on me. I got where the film makers were going. The third time, was definitely the charm! I love how the song builds, and their sexual excitement rises! ('Let's talk about...looove! I wanna feel it, too!Wanna feeeel it, toooo!') Yummy. And sort of naughty.Catherine Zeta Jone's 'Hit me with your best shot!' number, set in a church..(!).. to Michael Jackson-style dancing..(!?) is so 'over-the-top' that, after watching it, I had to ask myself, 'Did that just really freakin' happen?' This scene stayed with me way after leaving the theater, causing me to rush back, the next day, to watch it again. I'm not kidding.Jeeze! Holy cow, Batman! Not since 'Xanadu','Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club' 'Earth Girls are Easy' and, yes, 'From Justin to Kelly' has dancing and singing on the silver screen been so strange, and, well, sort of twisted. Almost at times, nightmarish. But, in a good way. Kinda.The scenes with Mary J.Blige singing in her club while strippers dance and twirl on poles behind her to ,'Shadows of the Night' and 'Anyway you want it' has to be seen to believe. It's like a sexed-up circus performance. Two more scenes that had me running back to see it again.The two young leads are so cute and sweet that you can almost smell the cotton candy. Maybe, taste it, too.I just loooove Drew's hair! Sooo thick and wavy like chocolate frosting. And his 'Juxebox Hero' song, in the record store with Sherri, is just way cool and spunky! Love the star-framed shades, boy!I also enjoyed their 'Waiting for a girl like you.' montage as they meet up for their first date behind the famous Hollywood sign. Oh, and Sherri spraying her 'big' hair with Aqua-Net while Drew sprays himself, down....there, with perfume, is pretty darn hot, in a cotton candy kind of way. Shades of 'Grease' come rolling like thunder during these scenes. (Summer Nights, Sandy, Hopelessly Devoted..)The only big gripe I have, aside from the annoying scenes with Stacee Jax's manager, (those scenes really drag down the film's mojo, in my opinion) is, after listening to the movie's soundtrack, I discovered that the 'Rock you like a Hurricane' number, with Jax and Sherri..(!?)..has apparently been cut out of the film! Why!? 'Hurricane' is one of my all time favorite rock songs from the 80's. The song is just so, angry, and...alive! Why remove it from the film but yet have it on the soundtrack? Last minute tampering, no doubt.By the way,is this the infamous scene where Sherri does a lap dance for Tom Cruise that was cut from the movie? And, if it was, where did it fit in with the rest of the story? Did Stacee come to the strip club where Sherri was working? Is it just a fantasy scene? Did it happen early on at The Bourbon Club?Just like Drew shouts in the movie...'I wanna Rock!' 'I wanna know!' What is up with this deleted scene and if it is, the 'Rock you like a Hurricane' number. Is it in the original broadway production? I guess I have to look it up, and do a little research. Unless, someone out there knows and can fill me in. Any feedback on this missing scene, or any others, would be helpful. Thanx....I read somewhere that it will be included on the director's DVD cut, and, well, that's just wrong. It smells like a gimmick to me. Just to make more money. 'Hey, if you want to see Sherri strip for Tom', you have to buy the DVD when it comes out. Boooo! That's pretty lame. Granted, I will be buying the DVD off Amazon when it comes out, it's just, watching the deleted scenes on TV, just isn't the same as watching it up on the big screen.Also, it is a little disappointing that they didn't play the song 'Oh, Sherri' in the movie. (briefly playing the intro while Drew was thinking about Sherri,just didn't cut it for me.) Steve Perry's 'Oh, Sherri' is a song you just don't hear much anymore these days on the radio. It would've been refreshing to hear Drew sing it to his girl, somewhere, sometime in the movie, even if it was just part of the song.Okay...I'm finished. For now. Until I start obsessing over the next poor movie that comes my way. And, I will. Being the movie freak that I am.

It wouldn't have been so bad if the filmmakers had not cast this godawful actress as the lead to sing.  I had no idea who it was and I've never heard of her.  I had to look her up when the movie was finished to find out why someone in their right mind would have given this person a lead singing role.  Her name is Julianne Hough, whom I have never heard of ever before this and now I know why.  When she opened her mouth it was like breathy helium.  Her voice was teeny bopper high it reduced this movie to the level of High School Musical or Glee.  There are no other young actresses out there who can actually sing?  Luckily, what pushes this to getting an average of three stars is everybody else in the movie who walks on screen and steals it right back out of that lousy actress/singers hands with the super high voice.  These are gifted actors who are not singers, but are able to pull it off.  Tom Cruise, Alec Baldwin, Paul Giamatti, Russell Brand, Catherine Zeta Jones and Mary J. Blige.  Eli Roth and Deborah Gibson make a worthwhile cameo.  The real treat is a duet and sexy outlandish performance between Tom Cruise and Malin Akerman who plays a Rolling Stone editor. Her voice was incredible and I was wondering, ""Why is she not the lead actress instead of this other chick?""  Anyway, if you can past the horrible singing of this Julianne Hough character you might be able to get through this insane story set in the 80's rock era.

1472895,A136MAOWGCU2C2,B005LAIHR2,K.T. May,"[3, 6]","If you've been anywhere near a television this week, you have probably been inundated with previews for the newest Broadway-show-turned-flick Rock of Ages. You were probably either convinced or put off by the lead billing of Tom Cruise as Stacee Jaxx, so let's tackle that first. Cruise portrayed Jaxx as if he were the son of Lestat from Interview with the Vampire and Guns 'n' Roses lead singer, Axl Rose with twice the libido of both.Cruise was unconvincing as Jaxx, and I wondered if real-life wife Katie Holmes had any qualms with the number of tongues that touched her husband's body during this film. Jaxx's costumes are outlandish and silly, particularly a certain codpiece, and I couldn't tear my eyes away from his tattoos. He is a typical rock star in that he is never fully conscious, and he enjoys wrecking things that don't belong to him. Also, he tends to drink...a lot. That being said, Jaxx does not carry the entire film, as the trailers might have you believe. If you are not a fan of Cruise's, there are plenty of other characters to entertain you. If you are a fan of his, then you will probably enjoy laughing at Jaxx's expense, which is what he also seems wont to do.Now that we've got that out of the way, if you were a fan of hair bands, Pat Benetar and arena rock, then this is the musical for you. Rock of Ages is jam-packed with '80s music, and does mash-ups and mini-montages equally well. You'll hear tunes from such bands as Bon Jovi, Guns 'n' Roses, Def Leppard, Foreigner, Journey, Poison, Whitesnake, Night Ranger, Twisted Sister and REO Speedwagon, amongst others.Rock of Ages tells the same story we've seen in Coyote Ugly and numerous other films in which the main character is a woman from a small town who flees to a bigger town with dreams of making it big, yadda, yadda, yadda. Along the way, she meets a guy and falls in love. Cue montage of happy moments. Then, some kind of misunderstanding breaks them up and they are both lost without each other, only to reunite at the end of the film. There is nothing in this plot that we haven't seen before. But then, in a film like this, plot is just the glue that holds the music together.The appropriately named Sherrie Christian (Julianne Hough) is a blonde bombshell from Oklahoma who looks like a groupie but acts like a good girl. She, of course, dreams of making it big in Hollywood. She gets mugged on her first night in California, and the sexier-with-longer-hair Drew (Diego Boneta) is conveniently there to witness it. He attempts to help her to no avail, but feels equally bad for and attracted to her, so he offers her a job at ""The Bourbon Room"", the nightclub where he works. She eagerly accepts as a waitress, although she dreams of being a singer.Dennis Dupree (Alec Baldwin) runs ""The Bourbon Room"" with Lonny (Russell Brand), and their presence reminded me of Empire Records if we had checked in on Joe and Lucas in ten years. One scene in particular between Baldwin and Brand was rather humorous and harkened back to the ""Hello"" scene in Harold and Kumar: Escape from Guantanamo Bay. When all else fails, homosexual humor tends to deliver.What follows is a typical love story that would occur in a film of this type, or even in an '80s film (maybe that was the point?). The wholly uninteresting subplot involves Catherine Zeta Jones as the tacky antagonist Patricia Whitmore, wife to Mayor Mike Whitmore (Bryan Cranston), who has a predictable agenda against Stacee Jaxx and his ""devil music"". She gathers some of the conservative women in town and they band together to picket ""The Bourbon Room"" and Jaxx.Paul Giamatti as Paul Gill, Stacee's manager, turned in the best performance of the film. He was the most convincing and enjoyable in a sea of cheesiness, weak acting and mediocrity. And we certainly saw enough close-ups of Malin Ackerman's (Constance Sack) clothed naughty bits to last us a while. Mary J. Blige has a throwaway part as the manager of a strip club, which could have shaved off some of the two hour and three minute runtime.All in, the performances were weak and cheesy, the dubbing did not quite match the lip syncing and the plot was nothing to write home to your mother about. But the love story drew me in, the music was entertaining and enjoyable and I wouldn't think twice about seeing this film again. When we think back on the '80s, we often squirm at memories of big hair, loud clothes and quirky music.

No. The tone is uneven - they should have gone more campy, but shied away from that and so the film ended up feeling uncertain of itself. The young leads - Julianne Hough and Diego Boneta - are weak, and there's not much of a plot. BUT if you like the 80s music of Foreigner, Journey, Pat Benatar, etc., and like the big names in this cast - Alex Baldwin, Russell Brand, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Paul Giamotti - it is well worth it. And Tom Cruise is simply fantastic! I am not usually a Cruise fan, but personally I do like him in comic spoof roles (this role and his Tropic Thunder role are my favorites.) He's riveting here, and I loved it. It's a lot of fun - if you're a product of the 80s, you'll probably find yourself singing along - and there's plenty of laughs too. If you don't like this music, or Tom Cruise ever, than this movie is probably not for you, as that's pretty much what it's got going for it.

1472905,A3UJUVPDP4XF3B,B005LAIHR2,"Lesley M. Schultz ""msthoth""","[0, 1]","I love the 80's and was hoping for an experience with this film like that in 'Mama Mia,' which is fine silly feel-good bubblegum pop with a tissue-paper thin plot.  'Mama Mia' was mostly an excuse for enjoying ABBA again, because your hair's gray now and you don't care anymore that ABBA wasn't cool then and pretty much isn't cool now. I was disappointed in this film for a a number of reasons.  The young leads were fine and most enjoyable.  Catherine Zeta-Jones was tolerable as the moral-crusading former groupie of the mega popular rock star, Stacee Jaxx.  I always like Alec Baldwin and Paul Giamatti and they didn't disappoint as the club owner and the rock star's manager, respectively.  Stacee Jaxx was supposed to be, as I guess, a fusion of Axel Rose, David Lee Roth and Steve Tyler.  Tom Cruise did a fine job acting the part of the decadent decaying and brain-dead rocker.  His voice, however, wasn't there for the music.  To be fair, he sang remarkably well considering he doesn't do that for a living, and as far as I know hasn't ever done something like this.  It wasn't that the vocal delivery was bad.  The voice was just wasn't right.  He isn't a musician and being able to sing the notes doesn't make you one. He's also a highish tenor, which doesn't work with the music he was singing.  That's fine in Journey songs but not heavy metal anthems. The way I thought about his performance as Stacee Jaxx was similar to the way a lot of people who are serious musicians and singers felt about Anne Hathaway's perforance in Les Miserables: beautifully acted and sung with a lot of emotion, but didn't do justice to the music (if you really loved the music.)  Although it's not as common for rock singers to be given credit for having real musical chops, especially metal hair band rockers, the best ones really do have them and it's not an accident. Also the sight of almost-50-year-old Tom Cruise walking around very buffed out and shirtless pretty much the whole time was not as impressive at it might have been. At this point it's self-parodying in a way that I don't think it was meant to be, and made him look both dated and sad, when the emphasis was supposed to be on his being still viable as a hard-rocking sex god.  Trust me, the girls don't love Mick Jagger anymore because his looks are sexy (it's only because he's extremely rich.)  Axel Rose looks freakish since his facelift, David Lee Roth is old and balding.  Both are paunchy and plainly Past It.  Steve Tyler looks like a hairy pregnant pencil, with streaks of gray in his long thinning locks.  However, unlike the other two, he still 'has it.'  Pity Tom couldn't have emulated that quality, although I think that's what he was trying for.Put your shirt back on, Tom, and SHUT UP.",2,"Fake Brew, Shallow High, Very Limited Buzz- Disappointing",1364169600,"03 25, 2013",2013,2764,"['love', '80', 'was', 'hoping', 'experience', 'film', ""'Mama"", 'Mia', 'fine', 'silly', 'feel-good', 'bubblegum', 'pop', 'tissue-paper', 'thin', 'plot', 'Mia', 'was', 'mostly', 'excuse', 'enjoying', 'ABBA', 'again', 'hair', 'gray', 'now', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'anymore', 'ABBA', 'was', ""n't"", 'cool', 'then', 'pretty', 'much', ""n't"", 'cool', 'now', 'was', 'disappointed', 'film', 'number', 'reasons', 'young', 'leads', 'were', 'fine', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'was', 'tolerable', 'moral-crusading', 'former', 'groupie', 'mega', 'popular', 'rock', 'star', 'Stacee', 'Jaxx', 'always', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'did', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'club', 'owner', 'rock', 'star', 'manager', 'respectively', 'Stacee', 'Jaxx', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'guess', 'fusion', 'Axel', 'Rose', 'David', 'Lee', 'Roth', 'Steve', 'Tyler', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'acting', 'part', 'decadent', 'decaying', 'brain-dead', 'rocker', 'voice', 'however', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'music', 'be', 'fair', 'sang', 'remarkably', 'well', 'considering', ""n't"", 'do', 'living', 'as', 'far', 'know', ""n't"", 'ever', 'done', 'something', 'was', ""n't"", 'vocal', 'delivery', 'was', 'bad', 'voice', 'was', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'right', ""n't"", 'musician', 'being', 'able', 'sing', 'notes', ""n't"", 'make', 'one', 'also', 'highish', 'tenor', ""n't"", 'work', 'music', 'was', 'singing', 'fine', 'Journey', 'songs', 'not', 'heavy', 'metal', 'anthems', 'way', 'thought', 'performance', 'Stacee', 'Jaxx', 'was', 'similar', 'way', 'lot', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'serious', 'musicians', 'singers', 'felt', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'perforance', 'Les', 'Miserables', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'sung', 'lot', 'emotion', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice', 'music', 'really', 'loved', 'music', 'not', 'common', 'rock', 'singers', 'be', 'given', 'credit', 'having', 'real', 'musical', 'chops', 'especially', 'metal', 'hair', 'band', 'rockers', 'best', 'ones', 'really', 'do', 'have', 'not', 'accident', 'Also', 'sight', 'almost-50-year-old', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'walking', 'around', 'very', 'buffed', 'out', 'shirtless', 'pretty', 'much', 'whole', 'time', 'was', 'not', 'impressive', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'point', 'self-parodying', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'made', 'look', 'dated', 'sad', 'when', 'emphasis', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'being', 'still', 'viable', 'hard-rocking', 'sex', 'god', 'Trust', 'girls', 'do', ""n't"", 'love', 'Mick', 'Jagger', 'anymore', 'looks', 'are', 'sexy', 'only', 'extremely', 'rich', 'Axel', 'Rose', 'freakish', 'facelift', 'David', 'Lee', 'Roth', 'old', 'balding', 'are', 'paunchy', 'plainly', 'Steve', 'Tyler', 'hairy', 'pregnant', 'pencil', 'streaks', 'gray', 'long', 'thinning', 'locks', 'However', 'other', 'two', 'still', 'Pity', 'Tom', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'emulated', 'quality', 'think', 'what', 'was', 'trying', 'for.Put', 'shirt', 'back', 'Tom', 'SHUT', 'UP']",N/A

If the viewer is searching for an intellectual or spiritual experience, a movie that inspires instrospection, or a movie that will stand the test of time, Rock of Ages is probably not what you're looking for (unless you're a child of the 80s and are still quoting lines from Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Porky's).  However, it the viewer understands this movie doesn't offer elements of intellect, thereby having a more realistic expectation of the movie, then this is a downright fun flick to watch.  And if the viewer is a child of the 80s who grew up listening to the cassette tapes of some of the era's greatest Glam Rock Hair Bands, then this movie is nothing less than a grand trip down Memory Lane, singing along with great oldies (No Way!!  Oldies??  Say it isn't so!) from groups like Def Leppard, Journey, Foreigner, Joan Jett, Pat Benatar, REO Speedwagon, Guns 'N Roses, The Scorpions, and so much more.  And in addition to the music, the directors have mixed in some type of simple love story played out by characters with combined IQs of maybe a 100 - but that's okay, cuz this movie wasn't made for the story (or the intellectual viewer) - it's all about the MUSIC.So be realistic about this movie and simply enjoy it for what it is - a 2 hour retreat from the world to the nostalgia of a great music era gone by.  Do that and you just might find yourself being simply entertained as you sing along to some great tunes that helped define the era.  Expect more than that, and you'll probably be disappointed.P.S. Some of the lip syncing is pretty bad too, but just go with it!P.S.S. Having said all that, in the interest of fairness across the generations I am obligated to report that my teens say this music makes their ears bleed...but what would they know, they're just teens - though they do seem to have all the answers to life's mysterious questions, or so they tell me, their stupid old man.

Laugh out loud funny. That alone, seems to take the entire audience I was with by surprise. So-much-so, that they applauded and laughed throughout the film out loud. Like me!Hearing these songs done by Tom Cruise (Mission Impossible, Top Gun) singing Bon Jovi's classic ""Wanted Dead or Alive,"" (YES TOM SINGS AND VERY WELL TOO!) to Def Leppard's hit ""Pour Some Sugar On Me,"" and Guns `N Roses anthem ""Paradise City."" Along with Cruise then doing duets with Malin Akerman (The Proposal, Watchmen) on Foreigner's power ballad, ""I Want To Know What Love Is,"" and shares the mic with Julianne Hough (Footloose-2011, Burlesque) on The Scorpions' ""Rock You Like A Hurricane."" ...was a cinematic shock to me. As well as a hysterically performed, yet really heartfelt delivery, duet of my fav REO Speedwagon song  ""I Can't Fight This Feeling"" between charismatic Alec Baldwin (30 Rock, Beetlejuice) and  an off-the-wall Russell Brand (Arthur, Get Him To The Greek). (SPOILER: Yes, the song title tells it all!)Based on the Broadway play - which premiered at the King King club in Hollywood, CA in 2005 transferred to the Vanguard theatre in Los Angeles, CA and finally went to the Broadway stage in 2009 - It was written by Justin Theroux (Iron Man 2, Tropic Thunder), Chris DArienzo (Hot, Barry Monday) and Allan Loeb (21, Just Go With It)  it tells the story of small town girl from Ohio,  Sherrie - played electrically and brilliantly by Julianne Hough and the L.A. city boy Drew, again played brilliantly by Diego Bonita (Mean Girls 2, 90210) who meet on the Sunset Strip while pursuing their Hollywood dreams. Their rock 'n' roll romance is told through other heart-pounding hits of Def Leppard, Joan Jett, Journey,  Night Ranger, Pat Benatar, Steve Perry, Twisted Sister, Poison and Whitesnake .Director Adam Shankman (Hairspray, Bedtime Stories) did his best to make you tap your feet, sing along and - again - make you laugh out loud. He threaded the simple story using the dynamics of the performances and the clever `mashed' songs of the 80's. He definatle got the looks and hair styles of the time and even slams the popular `boy bands' of the time. Hysterically! From scene #1 - It's got dance, choreography and bright colors...even an adjusted LA Skyline for the times!Tom Cruise, as Stacee Jaxx, gives another amazingly eclectic, strange, exotic (and sometime erotically suggestive) and funny performance. And I never knew he could sing. Amazing voice - yes it is him - and great musical `chops' to carry the film. Bravo Tom!Another stand-out performance was Cathrine Zeta-Jone (Chicago, The Terminal) as the religious wife of the Mayor of Los Angeles on vengeful (and personal) vendetta again Tom Cruise character the rock star himself, Stacee Jaxx! She is spicy, passionate with dance and funny and boy she can sing her version of Pat Benatar's most popular hit ""Hit Me With Your Best Shot"". Bravisimo Cathrine!Also some other standout performances came from Paul Giamatti (Sideways, Saving Private Ryan) as the crummy musical agent, singer-songwriter Mary J Blige (Entourage, Ghost Whisperer) as the club manager who takes Sherrie under her wing and Malin Ackerman (The Hearbreak Kid, Catch .44) as the confused Rolling Stone Magazine Reporter. Included are hidden cameos of REO Speedwagon's Kevin Cronin and Debbie Gibson themselves!My only concern is that if you were not familiar with these great songs of the 80's...will the newer generations of audiences get it? I hope so. I'm sure they will get the humor, but like me, will they be singing along out loud with the rest of the crowd - like first screenings audience I saw it with who remembers the time - way back when `Music Had Messages'?  (Kinda' of like my experience at the theatre with the film version of Mamma Mia...you couldn't help but sing along - out loud to the hits of ABBA!)

Watching it last night  didn't make me want to laugh, it made me want to vomit. The Tom Cruise character, Stacee Jaxx, was such a bad performance on his part, he made me cringe every time he grabbed a passing breast with that psycho look in his eyes and that odd head tilt. There are so many other actual rock artists that could have played that roll and been so much better. Cruise is just too wimpy to play a sex fiend rocker. It was just embarrassing to watch.**Sorta Spoiler Alert**The whole thing with Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand was ridiculous and laughable. Malin Akerman as the Rolling Stone reporter and her whole scene with Jaxx was both laughable and sad at the same time but not for the reasons that you would think, with them both being lonely. It was because Tom Cruise was just plain bad in that role. All his licking (""Open your mouth"") and groping and wierd spaced out looks were just too much. The whole movie just seemed contrived and thrown together to be the background to a great line-up of songs from the 80's.To me, this movie is to rock and roll as Showgirls was to actual showgirls in Vegas. It was a waste of time that I'll never get back and just proves that Cruise tries way too hard to be a ""serious"" or ""comedic"" actor, which ever he was going for. Russell Brand I can watch any time in almost any of his movies, he's always a riot. In fact, skip this one and watch ""Get Him to the Greek"" instead. He plays a much better rock star than Cruise ever could.Catherine Zeta-Jones just plays a bitch once again and way too good, kinda makes you wonder if it's a natural state or what. The love story between Hough and Boneta gets pushed to the back and it's way too sappy anyway. I say all this and I'm a female and love ""chick flix"". This did nothing for me but make me want to shower after it was over to wash away the feeling of slime.Rock of Ages is on my list as one of the worst films in a long time. I can't get the image of Stacee Jaxx out of my head, he was just way too creepy and what was with his pet monkey, ""Hey Man""? A nod to Michael Jackson and Bubbles? The Bourbon Room was a poor imitation at best of the world famous Whiskey-A-Go-Go on the Sunset Strip. Having been there many times and seen some fantastic bands, this just made my skin crawl!

The plots (boy meets girl, boy loses girl due to a misunderstanding, etc.; beleaguered owners trying to save their Sunset Strip rock club from a back tax debt and religious culture warriors) are trite, the script is lame, and because you see the jokes coming a mile away, they're not funny.Although my feelings about the songs in ""Rock of Ages"" range from indifference to active dislike, I did not hate ""Rock of Ages"" because I hate the genre or the milieu. I adore ""Almost Famous"" and enjoyed ""Get Him To the Greek."" This kind of music can make great kitschy fun when handled well. I like to lose myself in inspired silliness, having seen ""The Spongebob SquarePants Movie"" at least 12 times. On paper, I should have liked ""Rock of Ages.""  In this shockingly unimaginative, bloated, overlong execution, a fun idea wastes the talent involved.The talent is considerable: Alec Baldwin, Paul Giamatti, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Russell Brand. Julianne Hough and Diego Bioneta, the young leads, fit musical convention for ingenues with their sweetness and sincerity. Tom Cruise surprises as the wasted star Stacee Jaxx, whose performance is expected to save the struggling rock club. I don't think he's great--he's too compact, too bulked-up, too teeth-clenchingly Tom Cruise--to completely convince us that he's a Jim-Morrison-esque vocalist--but he throws himself into the role and, like the other actors, seems to enjoy himself. Unfortunately the cliche-ridden, limp script doesn't give any of these talented performers anything worthwhile to do.The only people I expect would like this movie would be those for whom the songs rise to ""soundtrack of my life"" significance. The actors all do their own singing, and the arrangements of the songs are pretty true to the originals. I knew Catherine Zeta-Jones could sing from ""Chicago,"" but who knew Tom Cruise could sing? He does, and very well. There are plenty of songs ""Rock of Ages,""  many of them mash-ups, for example, Foreigner's ""Juke Box Hero"" mashed up with Joan Jett's ""I Love Rock and Roll."" Whether the songs arise naturally from the action is another question.Infantile as ""Rock of Ages,"" may be, many parents will probably find the language and sexual suggestiveness inappropriate for their children.",1,Awful Movie--Only for Fans of the Music,1359936000,"02 4, 2013",2013,2449,"['Rock', 'Ages', 'based', 'theatrical', 'jukebox', 'musical', 'built', 'songs', '1980s', 'big-hair', 'power-pop', 'bands', 'Foreigner', 'Journey', 'Pat', 'Benatar', 'Joan', 'Jett', 'etc.', 'appallingly', 'bad', 'movie', 'plots', 'boy', 'meets', 'girl', 'boy', 'girl', 'due', 'misunderstanding', 'etc', 'beleaguered', 'owners', 'trying', 'save', 'Sunset', 'Strip', 'rock', 'club', 'back', 'tax', 'debt', 'religious', 'culture', 'warriors', 'are', 'trite', 'script', 'lame', 'see', 'jokes', 'coming', 'mile', 'away', ""'re"", 'not', 'funny.Although', 'feelings', 'songs', 'Rock', 'Ages', 'range', 'indifference', 'active', 'dislike', 'did', 'not', 'hate', 'Rock', 'Ages', 'hate', 'genre', 'milieu', 'adore', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'enjoyed', 'Get', 'Him', 'Greek', 'kind', 'music', 'can', 'make', 'great', 'kitschy', 'fun', 'when', 'handled', 'well', 'like', 'lose', 'inspired', 'silliness', 'having', 'seen', 'Spongebob', 'SquarePants', 'Movie', 'least', '12', 'times', 'paper', 'should', 'have', 'liked', 'Rock', 'Ages', 'shockingly', 'unimaginative', 'bloated', 'overlong', 'execution', 'fun', 'idea', 'talent', 'involved.The', 'talent', 'considerable', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'Russell', 'Brand', 'Julianne', 'Hough', 'Diego', 'Bioneta', 'young', 'leads', 'fit', 'musical', 'convention', 'ingenues', 'sweetness', 'sincerity', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'wasted', 'star', 'Stacee', 'Jaxx', 'performance', 'expected', 'save', 'struggling', 'rock', 'club', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'great', 'too', 'compact', 'too', 'bulked-up', 'too', 'teeth-clenchingly', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'completely', 'convince', 'Jim-Morrison-esque', 'vocalist', 'role', 'other', 'actors', 'enjoy', 'Unfortunately', 'cliche-ridden', 'limp', 'script', ""n't"", 'give', 'talented', 'performers', 'anything', 'worthwhile', 'do.The', 'only', 'people', 'expect', 'would', 'like', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'whom', 'songs', 'rise', 'soundtrack', 'life', 'significance', 'actors', 'do', 'own', 'singing', 'arrangements', 'songs', 'are', 'pretty', 'true', 'originals', 'knew', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'could', 'sing', 'Chicago', 'who', 'knew', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'could', 'sing', 'very', 'well', 'are', 'plenty', 'songs', 'Rock', 'Ages', 'many', 'mash-ups', 'example', 'Foreigner', 'Juke', 'Box', 'Hero', 'mashed', 'up', 'Joan', 'Jett', 'Love', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'songs', 'arise', 'naturally', 'action', 'question.Infantile', 'Rock', 'Ages', 'may', 'be', 'many', 'parents', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'language', 'sexual', 'suggestiveness', 'inappropriate', 'children']",N/A

1472939,A1H9EF4S5I9OKX,B005LAIHR2,M. Bullions,"[1, 4]","Adam Shankman struck gold with the movie musical ""Hairspray"" some years ago, and now he has released his first movie musical since, the similarly star-driven, but completely different ""Rock of Ages"". This film, like ""Hairspray"", is based on a popular Broadway musical, but the big difference is that this is a jukebox musical, using songs made famous by big names from the 1980's glam metal scene, such as Journey, Foreigner, Def Leppard, Twisted Sister, Poison and Pat Benetar.  In my opinion, this film didn't feel as fresh as ""Hairspray"" did years ago, but it really didn't need to. It's decadent, beautiful, delightfully trashy, sentimental and heartfelt when it needs to be, exponentially silly and delightful the entire way through. The energy of its wonderful cast is inescapable and exuberant.The storyline is all over the place - clearly disjointed and unorganized, but I don't go see musicals expecting a fantastic story, so that can be forgiven. The musical numbers are completely top notch. I had been against mash-ups in musical theater and film, since the American public will more than likely associate a mash-up with something trying to be ""Glee"" or trying to be a rip-off of that horrible TV show. It's important for me to mention right here that this show was on Broadway long before ""Glee"" became a thing. It was awesome then and it's awesome now.The story follows the young and naive Sherrie (Julianne Hough) who moves to Los Angeles from some small town in the height of the hair/glam metal scene in 1987. She meets and falls in love with city boy Drew (Diego Boneta). She works with him at The Bourbon Room, which is basically a fictitious version of CBGB's. Dennis (Alec Baldwin) and Lonny (Russel Brand) own the club, which is getting alot of attention during rockstar Stacee Jaxx (Tom Cruise)'s band's last show. The uppity religious conservative wife of the mayor (Catherine Zeta Jones) wants to shut the club down. And a whole bunch of other stuff happens too. Like I said, the story isn't that organized.Each actor of this ensemble displays irresistible energy, no matter how small or unimportant-seeming their role might be. For example, take Mary J Blige, who plays a character so small, I didn't catch her name. She's an R&B; singer who took acting lessons for this film. Once her character is introduced more than halfway into the film, they use her terrific singing voice every chance they get. She had a lot of enthusiasm, and without the enthusiasm that the film's smaller actors provided, the final product of this film would not have been as satisfying as it was.Julianne Hough from ""Dancing with the Stars"" and recent movie musicals ""Burlesque"" and ""Footloose"" does a fine job. She isn't anything incredible or revolutionary, but she does her job fairly well and she has good enthusiasm, even as an actress, not just a singer. Her love interest Drew, played by Diego Boneta is pretty extraordinary, however. He has top-notch singing abilities, and his character is immediately likable whenever the film begins. I'm quite glad they didn't use anyone from the Disney stock for this role, like Zac Efron or one of the Jonas brothers. It so easily could have been done wrong.I'm not too fond of Tom Cruise, I think he's a highly overrated actor who in general isn't all that great. However, he does an excellent job as Stacee Jaxx, the fictitious ""rock god"" who has done some wonderful work in music years before, but doesn't know what to do with his life anymore. I'm not really sure which singer Cruise was channeling in this role, but he pretty much sums up what the decade meant for rock `n roll. Jaxx is a womanizing, heavy-drinking, lying, cheating sleazeball, like so many stars of that era were. But the surprising part is that Tom Cruise can really, and I mean really sing, particularly evidenced by his fantastic rendition of ""Wanted Dead or Alive"".It's so great to see that after all of these years, Catherine Zeta-Jones is still Velma Kelly. As the film's main antagonist, she plays a great character to scowl at, however her singing abilities are a bit underused, as she only sings two songs in the film. Alec Baldwin and Russel Brand have alot of fun playing characters that might surprise you. I never really pictured either of them as a singer, but they somehow pull it off, and so does Malin Akerman, who also plays a smaller role, but does a nice job with what she has.While the story of ""Rock of Ages"" leaves a bit to be desired, and the movie heavily differs from the play that inspired it, I found myself wanting to sing along to the music, and I was in awe of the choreography and vocal ranges of the fantastic cast. The story could have been strung together in a way that didn't suggest that it only existed so the selected songs could be sung, but that's about the only thing I found wrong with it, and with a musical that has a set list as fantastic as this one, it's easy to overlook. Just like the poster suggests, it really is ""nothin' but a good time""!Grade: A-",5,Not to be taken seriously and nothin' but a good time!,1340150400,"06 20, 2012",2012,5024,"['Adam', 'Shankman',

1472940,A1RP0XAYQEEMDM,B005LAIHR2,"M. Curtis ""Dr. Zaius""","[2, 5]","The popular stage musical ""Rock of Ages"" is not fantastic by any means, but it is quite entertaining and the actors do well enough in their respective roles (and can actually sing well).  When I heard the musical was being adapted to the big screen I decided to check the movie out.  There have been terrific adaptations (""Chicago"") and a few good ones (""Rent"", ""The Phantom of the Opera"").  However ""Rock of Ages"" does not fall into either category.One of the appealing points of the musical is that it does not take itself very seriously.  The problem with the film adaptation is it does take itself seriously and that takes away from the enjoyment of the film.  It in fact kills the enjoyment pretty much on its own.In adaptations we inevitably see changes made from the source material.  A great example of that is the 1978 film adaptation of ""Grease"" which could not be more different from the musical.  However changes can work as they did with ""Grease"".  Not so much with ""Rock of Ages"".  A few characters who I enjoyed in the musical are not featured in the movie and are replaced by formulaic cliches that could not be more of a contrivance if you tried.  The villain of the musical is a German construction tycoon who is hell bent on tearing down The Burbon Room and it's surroundings for a new development much to the disdain of the tycoon's son.  In the movie these characters are removed and replaced by the Mayor of Hollywood (Bryan Cranston) and his nutcase wife (Academy Award winner Catherine Zeta-Jones.).  Both of these characters are just plan dull and loaded with formulaic plot devices (The husband is unfaithful.  The wife has a secret for her anger and hatred of ""The Devil's Music"".  Give me a break.).  The main characters of Sherrie and Diego have no chemistry whatsoever.  Alec Baldwin tries his best as Burbon Room owner Dennis Dupree, but I would not have cast him.  Speaking of cliches, Paul Giamatti's character of the manager who cares nothing about his clients and just cares about himself and money is something we have all seen many times over.This review would not be complete without mentioning Tom Cruise as Stacee Jaxx.  The character had a very small part in the stage musical.  Here he is the center of the entire movie.  I wish the writers stuck with the musical's treatment of the character.  In the play Jaxx is a slimeball who's antics finally catch up with him in the end (and rightfully so).  In the movie he is played as a poor misguided soul who does not mean to be a dirtbag, he just turned out that way because of his evil manager.  I think this was done because we have to make poster boy Tom Cruise look good so the ladies will flock to see the movie.  This is too bad because Cruise has shown he can play the bad guy and play the part well as he did in 2004's ""Collateral"" (Which earned him his third Oscar nomination.)  Also, I would love to know why he whispers all his dialogue.  In all fairness he does a desent job of singing the only Bon Jovi song I can tolerate ""Wanted Dead or Alive.""I would recommend you skip this movie and catch the musical instead.  The musical is not perfect by any means but it's a lot better than this misfire.",2,"""Rock of Ages"" Did Not Rock Me Like a Hurricane",1340150400,"06 20, 2012",2012,3197,"['popular', 'stage', 'musical', 'Rock', 'Ages', 'not', 'fantastic', 'means', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'actors', 'do', 'well', 'enough', 'respective', 'roles', 'can', 'actually', 'sing', 'well', 'When', 'heard', 'musical', 'was', 'being', 'adapted', 'big', 'screen', 'decided', 'check', 'movie', 'out', 'have', 'been', 'terrific', 'adaptations', 'Chicago', 'few', 'good', 'ones', 'Rent', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'However', 'Rock', 'Ages', 'not', 'fall', 'category.One', 'appealing', 'points', 'musical', 'not', 'take', 'very', 'seriously', 'problem', 'film', 'adaptation', 'take', 'seriously', 'away', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'fact', 'enjoyment', 'pretty', 'much', 'own.In', 'adaptations', 'inevitably', 'see', 'changes', 'made', 'source', 'material', 'great', 'example', '1978', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Grease', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'more', 'different', 'musical', 'However', 'changes', 'can', 'work', 'did', 'Grease', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'Rock', 'Ages', 'few', 'characters', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'musical', 'are', 'not', 'featured', 'movie', 'are', 'replaced', 'formulaic', 'cliches', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'more', 'contrivance', 'tried', 'villain', 'musical', 'German', 'construction', 'tycoon', 'who', 'hell', 'bent', 'tearing', 'down', 'Burbon', 'Room', 'surroundings', 'new', 'development', 'much', 'disdain', 'tycoon', 'son', 'movie', 'characters', 'are', 'removed', 'replaced', 'Mayor', 'Hollywood', 'Bryan', 'Cranston', 'nutcase', 'wife', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winner', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones.', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'plan', 'dull', 'loaded', 'formulaic', 'plot', 'devices', 'husband', 'unfaithful', 'wife', 'secret', 'anger', 'hatred', 'Devil', 'Music', 'Give', 'break.', 'main', 'characters', 'Sherrie', 'Diego', 'have', 'chemistry', 'whatsoever', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'best', 'Burbon', 'Room', 'owner', 'Dennis', 'Dupree', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'cast', 'Speaking', 'cliches', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'character', 'manager', 'who', 'nothing', 'clients', 'just', 'cares', 'money', 'something', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'times', 'over.This', 'review', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'complete', 'mentioning', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Stacee', 'Jaxx', 'character', 'had', 'very', 'small', 'part', 'stage', 'musical', 'Here', 'center', 'entire', 'movie', 'wish', 'writers', 'stuck', 'musical', 'treatment', 'character', 'play', 'Jaxx', 'slimeball', 'who', 'antics', 'finally', 'catch', 'up', 'end', 'rightfully', 'so', 'movie', 'played', 'poor', 'misguided', 'soul', 'who', 'not', 'mean', 'be', 'dirtbag', 'just', 'turned', 'out', 'way', 'evil', 'manager', 'think', 'was', 'done', 'have', 'make', 'poster', 'boy', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'look', 'good', 'so', 'ladies', 'will', 'flock', 'see', 'movie', 'too', 'bad', 'Cruise', 'shown', 'can', 'play', 'bad', 'guy', 'play', 'part', 'well', 'did', '2004', 'Collateral', 'Which', 'earned', 'third', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Also', 'would', 'love', 'know', 'why', 'dialogue', 'fairness', 'desent', 'job', 'singing', 'only', 'Bon', 'Jovi', 'song', 'can', 'tolerate', 'Wanted', 'Dead', 'Alive', 'would', 'recommend', 'skip', 'movie', 'catch', 'musical', 'instead', 'musical', 'not', 'perfect', 'means', 'lot', 'better', 'misfire']",N/A

Or, more plausibly, if these same monkeys are subjected to a free screening of Rock of Ages they will eventually run amok, rise against their masters and fitfully create their own Planet of the Apes sequel in order to redress such unremitting cruelty.Rock of Ages is not just a bad film, it is an excruciatingly bad film with a rationale for being made that in my present state of disbelief, I cannot even fathom. From the first frames, where a Greyhound busload of Midwestern farmers spontaneously break out into a chorus of Night Ranger's cloying anthem Sister Christian, my jaw never left the floor.

El-Hewie""","[10, 53]","One thing stands out in Tom Cruise's Rock of Ages, which is the constant singing in most scenes throughout the movie. But that boredom's remedy did not alleviate the shock of producing a low-level trash intended to defend filth by more filth.After four short weeks of watching the Indian film Rowdy Rathore with its memorable and classy stature in the art of performance and social education, here, comes Tom Cruise's Rock of Ages to fill the big screen with naked women body parts,inebriation, mindless affairs, and social junk bonds.On the Friday soiree, the movie theater was half-filled, mostly by white looking audience. But that does not tell it all. A movie that does not attract audience over the coming weeks, does not last. In contrast, the movie Rowdy Rathore witnessed lines of audience even on weekdays. Even though most of the audience of Rowdy Rathore were of the Indian looking, the attraction to the movie kept it going even in situation when the movie theater decided to interrupt its show.The movie plot was centered on splitting the profit between the singer, the agent, and the owner of the theater. As usual in such trashy movies, the owner of the theater must be sexually deviant and ugly, the agent ruthless and vigilant, and performer victim of sex, drugs, and ignorance.So, how did the story defend the Rock of Ages through rendering all women powerless to the sexual advances of the performer? The answer: catering to porn market.The single genuine love story that could have saved the movie was between an innocent Oklahoma's girl, arrived newly to Hollywood, and a bartender inspired by his newly found love. The movie must crush the genuine love story on the basis that [fame] and love do not befriend each other. The broken-heart performers were portrayed as being the prototype standard of stars.So, what went wrong in the American movie industry that makes it moviemakers stick their brains into its filth instead of appreciating its glory? That question was answered precisely, in Rowdy Rathore's film: It is the feeling. Compared to the Indian mindset, the American moviemakers lack such human feeling and must resort to porn to entertain.Mohamed F.

This film will likely be no exception.  Many will like the fresh delivery.  Others will want to just stick with the original.  Based on the popular Broadway show, ""ROA"" ups the star power and the production value in this excellent rendition.  The flimsy premise isn't anything new.  A young wannabe singer (Julianne Hough, ""Footloose"") from Tulsa heads to Hollywood in 1987.  She meets up with an equally attractive bar-back (Diego Boneta, ""Mean Girls 2"") who's also a wannabe front-man in a rock band.  They make nice, make out and fall in love complete with appropriate falling-in-love scenes including the requisite visit to the giant HOLLYWOOD sign.Put all that aside.  What's fun is the secondary performances of a large catalog of 80's ""big hair"" bands including Journey, Bon Jovi, Guns `n Roses, Styx, Twisted Sister, Poison and many others.  Not only are these well done, they are performed by some unlikely actors including Catherine Zeta-Jones, Russell Brand, Malin Akerman, Alec Baldwin and most importantly Tom Cruise as Stacee Jaxx.  They are all terrific and yes they can sing.One of my favorite songs and scenes is when Sherri (Hough) quits her job at the famous Bourbon Club and must take a job at an upscale strip club headed by a sympathetic Mary J. Blige.  They harmonize on the great Quarterflash song, ""Harden My Heart.""  The real star here however is Cruise as Jaxx, certainly a take on Axl Rose and others.  If you thought you saw something special when Cruise played profane producer Les Grossman in ""Tropic Thunder,"" wait `til you see his perpetually stoned Jaxx.  And make no mistake, he's for real and can deliver a song.  I don't know if the Academy has the ability to remember back to June, but Cruise's supporting performance is worth a nod.

I think that his best performances have been only when he got the right director in charge. Well, all my theory went to the trash when I saw ""Rock of Ages"". The movie is a mediocre musical (and I love musicals), the director, Adam Shankman, dissapointed me with Hairspray and now he did it again. Oh boy, this guy doesn't understand that he is not the new Bob Fosse?. The cast is superb, all people who know about musicals, especially Catherine Zeta Jones. I really prefer to remember her wonderful performance in Chicago and forget she was in this movie. And I thought that Cruise was going to ruin the movie!! All the contrary, he saved it. I must admit. Also, I doubted he could sing, I really thought he was being dubbed until I checked the credits. Seeing is believing. Well, Tom, you saved this movie from sinking in the bottom of the ocean. He is the only actor that took his character seriously, did his work, learned to sing I suppose, and really transformed into a rock star sort of Steven Tyler meets Axel Rose. And he did well, he deserves a nomination to some award. All the rest of the film is pretty bad. If you want to colaborate with the profits of this film, don't buy the movie, just the buy the soundtrack.And the 1980s was not the Age of Rock guys, that was the 60s and 70s.

I had not seen the stage production, but I've seen some other stage musicals converted to movies, and have been generally disappointed, sometimes appalled (I'm looking at you, ""Mama Mia!"")Set in 1987, the general plot involves a pair of newcomers to Hollywood, trying to become rock stars, but finding the closest they can get is working in the hottest rock & roll club on the Hollywood Strip.  From here, the story expands to include the owners of the club, a politician and his wife who are fighting the corrupting influence of rock music, and the biggest rock god on the planet, Stacee Jaxx, played by Tom Cruise.The movie starts out pretty cheesy, and the first few numbers garnered some giggles from the crowd, but when Tom Cruise arrives, he kicks the entire show into high gear.  Say what you will about him off screen, the man is a star onscreen, and does a phenomenal job in this role.The music was pretty solid, with the rock songs of the 80s performed by the actors.  In stark contrast to Mama Mia!, the songs here have been studio produced, and sound great, avoiding the bad karaoke effect such performances often have.  For the most part, the actors are not known for singing (who knew Tom Cruise and Alec Baldwin could sing?  OK so maybe Baldwin wasn't the strongest singer, but still decent for his role...)  Julianne Hough was likeable enough as the female lead, but surprisingly (considering a music career), her singing wasn't as good as some others.The movie got progressively better, and was quite funny.  But Tom Cruise carries this musical, and did so not only with very solid acting, but a shockingly decent rock and roll voice.  Without him, this would have been an unremarkable show.  With him, it is a fun movie that had people in the audience singing along with the film.",4,"More fun than expected - funny, good singing, and real star power from Tom Cruise",1339027200,"06 7, 2012",2012,1904,"['saw', 'Rock', 'Ages', 'sneak', 'preview', 'tonight', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'overall', 'experience', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'stage', 'production', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'stage', 'musicals', 'converted', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'generally', 'disappointed', 'sometimes', 'appalled', ""'m"", 'looking', 'Mama', 'Mia', 'Set', '1987', 'general', 'plot', 'pair', 'newcomers', 'Hollywood', 'trying', 'become', 'rock', 'stars', 'finding', 'closest', 'can', 'get', 'working', 'hottest', 'rock', 'roll', 'club', 'Hollywood', 'Strip', 'here', 'story', 'include', 'owners', 'club', 'politician', 'wife', 'who', 'are', 'fighting', 'corrupting', 'influence', 'rock', 'music', 'biggest', 'rock', 'god', 'planet', 'Stacee', 'Jaxx', 'played', 'Tom', 'Cruise.The', 'movie', 'out', 'pretty', 'cheesy', 'first', 'few', 'numbers', 'garnered', 'giggles', 'crowd', 'when', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'entire', 'show', 'high', 'gear', 'Say', 'what', 'will', 'off', 'screen', 'man', 'star', 'onscreen', 'phenomenal', 'job', 'role.The', 'music', 'was', 'pretty', 'solid', 'rock', 'songs', '80s', 'performed', 'actors', 'stark', 'contrast', 'Mama', 'Mia', 'songs', 'here', 'have', 'been', 'studio', 'produced', 'sound', 'great', 'avoiding', 'bad', 'karaoke', 'effect', 'such', 'performances', 'often', 'have', 'most', 'part', 'actors', 'are', 'not', 'known', 'singing', 'who', 'knew', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'could', 'sing', 'OK', 'maybe', 'Baldwin', 'was', ""n't"", 'strongest', 'singer', 'still', 'decent', 'role', 'Julianne', 'Hough', 'was', 'likeable', 'enough', 'female', 'lead', 'surprisingly', 'considering', 'music', 'career', 'singing', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'others.The', 'movie', 'got', 'progressively', 'better', 'was', 'quite', 'funny', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'musical', 'did', 'so', 'not', 'only', 'very', 'solid', 'acting', 'shockingly', 'decent', 'rock', 'roll', 'voice', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'unremarkable', 'show', 'fun', 'movie', 'had', 'people', 'audience', 'singing', 'film']",N/A
1473002,A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ,B005LAIHR2,Sean Pasek,"[1, 2]","You go to watch a movie like ""Rock of Ages"" for the music, not for the story.  Those who have knocked the film for a shady story aren't entirely wrong, but I will contend that the story, while not being the strength of the film, does enough to make the film work.You can't help but see that all of the performers from Tom Cruise to Paul Giamatti to Catherine Zeta-Jones to Alec Baldwin, had a blast making this film.  And why not?  They got to bring back the nostalgic time period, that many feel, was the last great decade of music.  The movie not only restores a number a quality 80s hits, but they do so in a way where the songs coincide with the story or moments in the story.You can't make a movie about 80s music without understanding and capturing the 80s music culture.  I remember going to school during that time period and seeing kids with long hair, black rock band t-shirts, and looking like the rockers that they all obviously idolized.  Our parents thought they were crazy.  It's ironic how with each generation of music, the previous generation doesn't tend to care for it.  My parents hated the music of my time just as their parents hated the music of their time.  And, I have to honestly say, I can't stand most of the music today.  Go figure.The story takes place on the Sunset Strip, a place on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood that was considered by the music world to be the mecca of rock music.  If you were anyone, you got your start here.  Bands from ""Def Leppard"" to ""Journey"" all fondly remember the days of sinking their teeth into the music scene by performing gigs at places like ""Whisky a Go-Go,"" ""Roxy,"" ""Pandora's Box,"" and the ""London Fog.""  Here ""Rock of Ages"" centers around ""The Bourbon"" (fictionalized locale used in place of ""Whisky a Go-Go"").Enter Sherrie Christian (yeah, if you can't make any connections with THAT name, then you don't know hit 80s songs!), played by Julianne Hough.  She's a girl from Oklahoma who has a dream of being a rock singer.  She meets Drew played by singer Diego Boneta who also has aspirations of being a singer.  He works at ""The Bourbon"" and when unfortunate events quickly strike Sherrie, Drew helps her to land a waitressing job at the club she has dreamed of since she was little.The Bourbon is in dire financial straits and club owner Dennis Dupree (wonderfully played by Alec Baldwin) is counting on legendary rock star, Stacee Jaxx's (Tom Cruise in yet another signature-defining role that will blow you away!) one-night-only performance to pull him out.  Of course, we have the underhanded agent, Paul Gill (Paul Giamatti) who has other ideas.On the other side of the rock music fence you have Patricia Whitmore (Catherine Zeta-Jones), the wife of the new Los Angeles mayor whose sole mission is to end rock music for good in Los Angeles.  People, not familiar with characters like this, have complained about the lack of authenticity of Whitmore, but  I remember people preaching against rock music, making claims that rock groups were Satanic and evil.The performances in this film are all top-notch.  The standout is easily Tom Cruise's Stacee Jaxx who easily models the typical rocker of that era.  He dresses and acts the part perfectly.  Band members of Journey and Poison have said, ""that's how we were!  We had drugs, sex, and alcohol.  We were kings of the Sunset Strip!""  Everyone in the film does their own singing, and Cruise was no exception.  He practiced for 5 hours a day for 5 months, and even when band members of Def Leppard were brought on set to watch him, they were astounded at his music ability.  Cruise reportedly has a four-octave range, and while he obviously isn't Def Leppard, his rendition of ""Pour Some Sugar On Me"" is pretty darn good!  One of the producers overheard a Def Leppard member say, ""Christ, he's better than we were!""  Not true, of course (which even the producer stated), but getting that type of feedback from members of one of the most popular bands of the 80s is high praise!There are over 20 memorable hit songs scattered throughout the film.  I'll wager that nearly everyone knows them all.  Back to the 80s culture on-screen brings back the crazy hair-styles and outfits that were so popular and common back in the day...the tight spandex pants, the guys when looked at from behind, you thought were girls, and so forth.  In the extra features, many of the artists laugh at how they looked back then, but then, that was the culture.The song and dance numbers are all fun, and I still remember some people in the theater audience clapping and singing right along.  It helps, of course, to have one of the world's best dancers in Julianne Hough who really did a job with her dance numbers.  Watch the extended version, as most of her dance numbers were edited out for the theatrical version.Is the story somewhat cheesy and predictable?  Yes, but so what?  The point is that the story is fun, and it keeps and plays in time with the songs.  ""Rock of Ages"" is just a ton of fun and a good time.  I've even had people who weren't around, or were too young, to appreciate the music of that era say things like, ""why don't they do music like that anymore?""  ""Rock of Ages"" even goes so far as to poke fun at the next generation ""boy bands"" that basically replaced the power ballads and music of the 80s' bands.So if you want nothing but a good time?

I grew up listening to -and loving - every song in this movie (in the 80's, when they came out!), and that was why I wanted to see it. I wanted to like it more than I did.

It's not as good as you probably thought it was going to be and that comes from the top-to-bottom demograohic they are trying to appeal to in the casting.  The very weak part, depending on your age, I guess, is the two younger male and female leads.  They are nice people, but just too bland to push anything at you from the screen. I really doubt 12 year olds were flocking to see this movie, so I doubt they made any extra money by placing these two so centrally.  And it certainly did bring down the movie's critical ratings. Tom Cruise is the one you are going to be waiting for between lapses in his screen time. He leaves nothing left ungiven as usual.

It's based on a very popular ""jukebox musical"" and tells the story of Sherrie and Drew, and their romance amid the hair metal glam of the Sunset Strip of the mid-80s. Set against the backdrop of the Bourbon Room, and featuring performances by Russell Brand, Alec Baldwin, Mary J. Blige, and, in a wierd casting move that somehow works for this movie, Tom Cruise as a washed-up rocker.OK, it's not exactly a documentary on the music of the late 80s, but this type of musical was always intended to pay tribute to the music, not follow national events exactly as they were.  And it is a fun story: Sherrie and Drew meet when she comes to LA and gets a job at the Bourbon Room, a dive bar owned by a washed-up rocker. Stacee Jaxx is set to play a show there, his last with his band because he is so difficult to work with, and everyone is excited, except the mayor's wife, played by Catherine Zeta-Jones, who starts a crusade against Stacee and the bar, ostensibly to clean up the area, but also to be able to sell the land to developers. The night of the show, events conspire that end up breaking up Stacee and Drew and shocking Stacee out of his selfish stupor. Will they realize their rock and roll dreams or is it one last round at the Bourbon?I can't help but like this movie, but maybe because I'm a fan of musical theatre, and I know how these tribute musicals work. It was fun for me to remember the songs that the writers used to enhance the story. And I enjoyed the performances.  Russell Brand was funny, in a way he usually is not. Julianne Hough was amazing, and the male lead was astoundingly attractive!  Mary J Blige as the owner of the strip club was wonderful in her role, and I have to say Tom Cruise, once you got over the shock that he is actually singing, was really good. It felt like we were remembering the best parts of the metal scene, looking back fondly 25 years out. And the version of ""Don't Stop Believing"" is incredible!There is a lot of sexuality, so this is not a musical for children to watch, but I think, if you loved the 80s and that kind of music, this is a great, fun movie to watch.",5,"Don't take it too seriously, just have some fun",1369008000,"05 20, 2013",2013,2240,"['did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'Oscar-caliber', 'movie', 'not', ""n't"", 'mean', 'not', 'fun', 'movie', 'based', 'very', 'popular', 'jukebox', 'musical', 'story', 'Sherrie', 'Drew', 'romance', 'hair', 'metal', 'glam', 'Sunset', 'Strip', 'mid-80s', 'Set', 'backdrop', 'Bourbon', 'Room', 'featuring', 'performances', 'Russell', 'Brand', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Mary', 'J.', 'Blige', 'wierd', 'casting', 'move', 'somehow', 'movie', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'washed-up', 'rocker.OK', 'not', 'exactly', 'documentary', 'music', 'late', '80s', 'type', 'musical', 'was', 'always', 'intended', 'pay', 'tribute', 'music', 'not', 'follow', 'national', 'events', 'exactly', 'were', 'fun', 'story', 'Sherrie', 'Drew', 'meet', 'when', 'LA', 'job', 'Bourbon', 'Room', 'dive', 'bar', 'owned', 'washed-up', 'rocker', 'Stacee', 'Jaxx', 'set', 'play', 'show', 'there', 'last', 'band', 'so', 'difficult', 'work', 'everyone', 'excited', 'mayor', 'wife', 'played', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'who', 'crusade', 'Stacee', 'bar', 'ostensibly', 'clean', 'up', 'area', 'also', 'be', 'able', 'sell', 'land', 'developers', 'night', 'show', 'events', 'conspire', 'end', 'up', 'breaking', 'up', 'Stacee', 'Drew', 'shocking', 'Stacee', 'selfish', 'stupor', 'Will', 'realize', 'rock', 'roll', 'dreams', 'one', 'last', 'round', 'Bourbon', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'movie', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'fan', 'musical', 'theatre', 'know', 'how', 'tribute', 'musicals', 'work', 'was', 'fun', 'remember', 'songs', 'writers', 'used', 'enhance', 'story', 'enjoyed', 'performances', 'Russell', 'Brand', 'was', 'funny', 'way', 'usually', 'not', 'Julianne', 'Hough', 'was', 'amazing', 'male', 'lead', 'was', 'astoundingly', 'attractive', 'Mary', 'J', 'Blige', 'owner', 'strip', 'club', 'was', 'wonderful', 'role', 'have', 'say', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'once', 'got', 'shock', 'actually', 'singing', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'felt', 'were', 'remembering', 'best', 'parts', 'metal', 'scene', 'looking', 'back', 'fondly', '25', 'years', 'out', 'version', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Stop', 'Believing', 'incredible', 'lot', 'sexuality', 'not', 'musical', 'children', 'watch', 'think', 'loved', '80s', 'kind', 'music', 'great', 'fun', 'movie', 'watch']",N/A

The music is fun and well done, the acting is good and Tom Cruise really does play himself well (lol).That being said, there are some strange things about this movie. First off its conflicting themes. It's glorifying rock, which isn't bad except it's somewhat humorous when they mock boybands and pop yet use such heavy AutoTune for their music. It would be kind of like Glee mocking highschool musical. I just found it somewhat ironic.Their message about fame is actually great. However the weird feel good ending doesn't fit at all with the message that this film was actually developing. They had something good going about fame, and what society does to the famous and then they just kind of threw it out.A few other annoying things: the fundies. C'mon guys this is just so played out. The hypocritical Christians trying to put a stop to things, then surprise surprise surprise they end up with some humiliating event in their past they're angry about. It's just unoriginal. I feel like writers have completely ran out of ideas for bad guys. This film didn't NEED bad guys. If you can't write something original don't write at all.I would have enjoyed this movie more without the autotune (like I said before). This style of music caters more to the mainstream (which... again goes against their theme, but ok). Other than the autotune though they didn't take extensive liberties with the songs, which was nice, there were some really great arrangements in this movie.

Now we have this attempt to combine the familiarity of MTV's golden hair-band age with a Moulin Rouge twist.This movie was not the most awful thing in the world, but to think that they'd make a movie that uses gag-inducing pop metal from the 80s to tell a clich&eacute;d story of love and stardom is mind-boggling. Of all the eras and genres that this formula might've been applied to, the choice of schmaltzy Starship, Quarterflash, Extreme, et al seems curious to say the least. It isn't like I can't hear any of Journey's bigger hits in dozens of other movies (Adam Sandler must own the publishing rights), so why shove these rather generic songs at the public yet again?There is a near-criminal misuse of some talented performers to boot. Giamatti, Zeta-Jones, and Baldwin try, but they're given so little to work with. Cruise hams it up as a jaded, drunken, leather-clad rocker, and seems grossly miscast, as does Baldwin as the nightclub owner.The love story is tepid, the songs are memorable more for their cheese-factor than anything else, and the few surprises are forced and underwhelming.

Russell Brand irritates the hell out of me -there was an annoying monkey in the movie that was equally bad to have to sit through.

The role that she has relies on showing off her body and less on what she has to bring to the character of Sherrie.

A few genuine surprises (during the ""I Can't Fight This Feeling"" sequence), and some very cool rock club sequences as our heroes seriously get the lead out! The rock `n' roll weirdo scenes are pretty funny, if you think about it, and somehow the relatively sophisticated plot threads do come together fairly well in a not-necessarily-based-on-impossible-coincidences sorts of things happening. But hey, it's only rock `n' roll... and I like it!On the negative side, it is a bit grueling listening to Tom Cruise singing ""Paradise City"" and other rock classics, and the girl vocalist's helium singing can be jarring at times. Still, you have to credit the film for really embracing Eighties rock, some of which hasn't aged well (Night Ranger, Pat Benatar) and putting it right up there on the pedestal.Best line of the movie happens when the boy and the girl are comparing their misfortunes:Girl: ""I mean, jeez - I'm a stripper.""Boy: ""Well...

He just stepped into something you would NEVER think of him doing and made it real. And he sang too? Whoa! But wait! There's more. He was 49 years old when he did this! It doesn't show at all. He looked great.After the opening first few minutes, I thought, ""Uh oh. I have chosen the wrong movie."" Like the title suggests, it's all about rock and roll.

Julianne Hough and Diego Boneta star as the two wanna-be rock stars. Oh if they could just get their break....The music is both the plus and minus side to the film.

The seasoned veterans of the film seemed to have enjoyed making this production as it lacks any seriousness. I spent most of the movie waiting for the talking to get over and the next song to begin.

The hair band rock of the 1980s is so easy to mock and ridicule that almost everyone has taken a shot at it; what more can you add?  The answer is not much.  The premise of ""Rock of Ages"" is as bland and predictable mix of sex, drugs, and rock n roll as well as hopes and dreams.  Sherrie Christian (Sister Christian anyone?) hails from Tulsa and hopes to break into the Hollywood music scene.  In a predictable and contrived scene barback Drew Boley tries to thwart a robber from stealing Sherrie's belongings and suddenly the two are together.  It almost sounds like a musical...oh wait...it is!  And it doesn't get better from there.  From there an endless array of characters are introduced which only serves to muddle things and at the same time plays into the whole predictability.  Club owners trying desperately to save their club, if only people could embrace rock, but curses, they need something new and innovative.  A famous rocker agrees to a performance to help wipe out his debts.  The complications and plot lines multiply from there and despite a fairly all-star cast they aren't given much to do and most seem to be either on autopilot or ridiculously overdoing it.  Oddly enough, the only person capable of reining in the crazy is Tom Cruise in the role of rocker Stacee Jaxx, who plays the role with aplomb yet keeps it from going over the top.  Clearly Cruise is trying to rehabilitate his box office poison image and goes a long ways towards that here, but even he can't help salvage this dud.  I'm not even going to both with the plot and how the movie unfolds except to say it defines by-the-numbers predictability right up to the finale which you could pretty much have guessed in the first 15 minutes of the film.  Even if you like 1980s hair band metal this movie is going to bore you as no one wants to pay to see actors essentially doing upscale karaoke, and bad karaoke at that.  Change the music and you could have had ""Golddiggers of 1933"" ""Singing in the Rain"" or ""A Chorus Line"".  I was bored stiff at the 30 minute mark and honestly, it didn't get better from there.  There is absolutely nothing about ""Rock of Ages"" I can recommend or which redeems it.  I should have taken the words of Dee Synder and said ""We're Not Gonna Take It!""",1,So much talent yet such unsatisfying results,1343001600,"07 23, 2012",2012,2424,"['had', 'pretty', 'low', 'expectations', 'Rock', 'Ages', 'based', 'fairly', 'insipid', 'jukebox', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'similarly', 'found', 'be', 'waste', 'time', 'hair', 'band', 'rock', '1980s', 'so', 'easy', 'mock', 'ridicule', 'almost', 'everyone', 'taken', 'shot', 'what', 'more', 'can', 'add', 'answer', 'not', 'much', 'premise', 'Rock', 'Ages', 'bland', 'predictable', 'mix', 'sex', 'drugs', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'as', 'well', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'Sherrie', 'Christian', 'Sister', 'Christian', 'anyone', 'Tulsa', 'break', 'Hollywood', 'music', 'scene', 'predictable', 'contrived', 'scene', 'barback', 'Drew', 'Boley', 'tries', 'thwart', 'robber', 'stealing', 'Sherrie', 'belongings', 'suddenly', 'two', 'are', 'together', 'almost', 'musical', 'oh', 'wait', ""n't"", 'get', 'better', 'there', 'endless', 'array', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'only', 'muddle', 'things', 'same', 'time', 'whole', 'predictability', 'Club', 'owners', 'trying', 'desperately', 'save', 'club', 'only', 'people', 'could', 'embrace', 'rock', 'curses', 'need', 'something', 'new', 'innovative', 'famous', 'rocker', 'performance', 'help', 'wipe', 'out', 'debts', 'complications', 'plot', 'lines', 'multiply', 'fairly', 'all-star', 'cast', 'are', ""n't"", 'given', 'much', 'do', 'most', 'seem', 'be', 'either', 'autopilot', 'ridiculously', 'overdoing', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'only', 'person', 'capable', 'reining', 'crazy', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'role', 'rocker', 'Stacee', 'Jaxx', 'who', 'role', 'aplomb', 'yet', 'going', 'top', 'Clearly', 'Cruise', 'trying', 'rehabilitate', 'box', 'office', 'poison', 'image', 'long', 'ways', 'towards', 'here', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'salvage', 'dud', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'going', 'plot', 'how', 'movie', 'say', 'by-the-numbers', 'predictability', 'right', 'up', 'finale', 'could', 'pretty', 'much', 'have', 'guessed', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'film', 'Even', 'like', '1980s', 'hair', 'band', 'metal', 'movie', 'going', 'bore', 'one', 'pay', 'see', 'actors', 'essentially', 'doing', 'upscale', 'karaoke', 'bad', 'karaoke', 'Change', 'music', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'Golddiggers', '1933', 'Singing', 'Rain', 'Chorus', 'Line', 'was', 'bored', 'stiff', '30', 'minute', 'mark', 'honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'better', 'there', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'Rock', 'Ages', 'can', 'recommend', 'should', 'have', 'taken', 'words', 'Dee', 'Synder', 'said', ""'re"", 'Not', 'Gon', 'Take']",N/A
1473043,A2U80IPZXN5V1U,B005LAIHR2,Tommy Sixx Morais,"[0, 2]","This review is coming from a 21 year old who is huge fan of 80's music, fashion and culture that borders on the obsession. After hearing about the Rock of Ages film project I feared it would be a big Hollywood production that would end up as a B film as best and wouldn't pay proper tribute to the 1980's, the music and the scene it attempts to tribute. This is more of less exactly what happened. There are some nice moments and entertaining parts, and some versions of the songs are actually decent but it fails to be a modern day Grease or whatever it was that they attempted it to be. It's as if they didn't know what they wanted to do with this except have some popular 80's tune, a bit of a throwback to the fashion of the era and try to hold it together with songs, Grease and some of the other musicals I've seen had heart.Rock of Ages is set in L.A. on the Sunset Strip in 1987, to start it has the time and setting properly set. The look and atmosphere is just about right which are sure to bring back memories. The song selection is for the most part very good and much of what you would expect musically wise: ""Don't Stop Believin'"" (Journey) ""Wanted Dead or Alive"" (Bon Jovi), ""Pour Some Sugar On Me"" (Def Leppard), 'Hit Me With Your Best Shot' (Pat Benatar), ""I Wanna Rock"" (Twisted Sister), ""Sister Christian"" (Night Ranger) and many others.Tom Cruise as Stacee Jaxx is one of the few actual things that does work for Rock of Ages. His performances and duets were the more enjoyable ones due to his given Rockstar character and his portrayal of Stacee. Cruise's character comes off as a true rockstar of the 80's and it looks like he based his performance on the rockers of the era (Axl Rose mostly in terms of style and fashion).  It's not amazing acting but he is likeable as the sleazy rockstar. I like Russel Brand usually but even if he almost always looks like and carries a rockstar vibe was lame in this film. His character's interactions with his bar owner friend are homoerotic and almost uncomfortable to watch. Julianne Hall and Diego Boneta as and Sherrie and Drew the two stars are likeable and well cast and Rock of Ages really revolves around their story.I started watching Rock of Ages with little hope of it actually good, but with an open mind and expecting at least to be entertained. It more or less succeed at being a 'good' film in my opinion and misses in some areas I thought. To me the big problem with Rock of Ages is that it doesn't tell a story to which you can relate or get into land as a musical, that's not good. I love the 80's but my friends who saw this couldn't get why or what I like about the decade and it does't make it look cool and I don't think it would make any audience want to live them just for one day. It somehow misses and doesn't connect with it's audience because it's too self-obsessed with almost being a parody to create genuine feelings that can be related to, it just doesn't work all that well. It is fun and some of it is entertaining but it doesn't come off anywhere near great.Overall, it comes off as karaoke with some interesting versions and some rather poor ones and what seemed like a potentially good story was thrown away. It's a big production with big names to appeal to the general public but it fails to pay proper tribute to the 1980's which was the main goal unfortunately. I'm sure there was a market for this film just as I'm sure there are quite a few 80's enthusiast and nostalgics who are downright embarrassed by Rock of Ages. It lacks heart an substance and was very Glee-like. Towards the end it was getting a little to painful to watch for this viewer as it was getting long. I like that they wanted to pay homage to the 80's and the music but the story wasn't anywhere near captivating and although some of the musical numbers are fun and entertaining, Rock of Ages falls short of what it hopes to be. It doesn't translate to film so well. 2.5 out of 5.P.S. there's a great bonus feature 'Legends of the Strip' mini documentary of the era with major rock artists that lived the 80's and tell tales and stories about the Sunset Strip, the music and the fashion. that's worth watching",2,Fails to be the tribute it aims to be,1358208000,"01 15, 2013",2013,4182,"['review', 'coming', '21', 'year', 'old', 'who', 'huge', 'fan', '80', 'music', 'fashion', 'culture', 'borders', 'obsession', 'hearing', 'Rock', 'Ages', 'film', 'project', 'feared', 'would', 'be', 'big', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'B', 'film', 'best', 'would', ""n't"", 'pay', 'proper', 'tribute', '1980', 'music', 'scene', 'tribute', 'more', 'less', 'exactly', 'what', 'happened', 'are', 'nice', 'moments', 'entertaining', 'parts', 'versions', 'songs', 'are', 'actually', 'decent', 'be', 'modern', 'day', 'Grease', 'whatever', 'was', 'attempted', 'be', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'wanted', 'do', 'except', 'have', 'popular', '80', 'tune', 'bit', 'throwback', 'fashion', 'era', 'try', 'hold', 'together', 'songs', 'Grease', 'other', 'musicals', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'had', 'heart.Rock', 'Ages', 'set', 'L.A.', 'Sunset', 'Strip', '1987', 'start', 'time', 'setting', 'properly', 'set', 'look', 'atmosphere', 'just', 'about', 'right', 'are', 'sure', 'bring', 'back', 'memories', 'song', 'selection', 'most', 'part', 'very', 'good', 'much', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'musically', 'wise', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Stop', 'Believin', 'Journey', 'Wanted', 'Dead', 'Alive', 'Bon', 'Jovi', 'Pour', 'Sugar', 'Me', 'Def', 'Leppard', 'Me', 'Your', 'Best', 'Shot', 'Pat', 'Benatar', 'Wan', 'na', 'Rock', 'Twisted', 'Sister', 'Sister', 'Christian', 'Night', 'Ranger', 'many', 'others.Tom', 'Cruise', 'Stacee', 'Jaxx', 'one', 'few', 'actual', 'things', 'work', 'Rock', 'Ages', 'performances', 'duets', 'were', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'ones', 'due', 'given', 'Rockstar', 'character', 'portrayal', 'Stacee', 'Cruise', 'character', 'off', 'true', 'rockstar', '80', 'based', 'performance', 'rockers', 'era', 'Axl', 'Rose', 'mostly', 'terms', 'style', 'fashion', 'not', 'amazing', 'acting', 'likeable', 'sleazy', 'rockstar', 'like', 'Russel', 'Brand', 'usually', 'even', 'almost', 'always', 'rockstar', 'vibe', 'was', 'lame', 'film', 'character', 'interactions', 'bar', 'owner', 'friend', 'are', 'homoerotic', 'almost', 'uncomfortable', 'watch', 'Julianne', 'Hall', 'Diego', 'Boneta', 'Sherrie', 'Drew', 'two', 'stars', 'are', 'likeable', 'well', 'cast', 'Rock', 'Ages', 'really', 'around', 'story.I', 'started', 'watching', 'Rock', 'Ages', 'little', 'hope', 'actually', 'good', 'open', 'mind', 'expecting', 'least', 'be', 'entertained', 'more', 'less', 'succeed', 'being', ""'good"", 'film', 'opinion', 'misses', 'areas', 'thought', 'big', 'problem', 'Rock', 'Ages', ""n't"", 'tell', 'story', 'can', 'relate', 'get', 'land', 'musical', 'not', 'good', 'love', '80', 'friends', 'who', 'saw', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'why', 'what', 'like', 'decade', ""does't"", 'make', 'look', 'cool', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'make', 'audience', 'want', 'live', 'just', 'one', 'day', 'somehow', 'misses', ""n't"", 'connect', 'audience', 'too', 'self-obsessed', 'almost', 'being', 'parody', 'create', 'genuine', 'feelings', 'can', 'be', 'related', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'well', 'fun', 'entertaining', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'anywhere', 'great.Overall', 'off', 'karaoke', 'interesting', 'versions', 'rather', 'poor', 'ones', 'what', 'seemed', 'potentially', 'good', 'story', 'was', 'thrown', 'away', 'big', 'production', 'big', 'names', 'appeal', 'general', 'public', 'pay', 'proper', 'tribute', '1980', 'was', 'main', 'goal', 'unfortunately', ""'m"", 'sure', 'was', 'market', 'film', 'just', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'quite', 'few', '80', 'enthusiast', 'nostalgics', 'who', 'are', 'downright', 'embarrassed', 'Rock', 'Ages', 'heart', 'substance', 'was', 'very', 'Glee-like', 'end', 'was', 'getting', 'little', 'painful', 'watch', 'viewer', 'was', 'getting', 'long', 'like', 'wanted', 'pay', 'homage', '80', 'music', 'story', 'was', ""n't"", 'anywhere', 'captivating', 'musical', 'numbers', 'are', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'Rock', 'Ages', 'short', 'what', 'be', ""n't"", 'translate', 'film', 'so', 'well', '2.5', '5.P.S', 'great', 'bonus', 'feature', 'Strip', 'mini', 'documentary', 'era', 'major', 'rock', 'artists', 'lived', '80', 'tell', 'tales', 'stories', 'Sunset', 'Strip', 'music', 'fashion', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

Before I start this (in case you don't already know) this is a musical so if you are not into musicals you can stop reading.

Girl lives in small town, moves to big city, instantly gets robbed but is helped by a boy who immediately gets her a job at the place she wanted and they fall in love...a misunderstanding causes a fight...yada yada yada.

The film is a tribute to the '80s rock scene, the time of great Twisted Sister, but somehow lacks the power and energy of the same director's previous musical adaptation and its charming heroine Tracy.Set in 1987, ""Rock of Ages"" starts with Sherrie Christian (Julianne Hough), a girl from Oklahoma with a dream of becoming a singer. In LA she meets Drew Boley (Diego Boneta), an aspiring rock singer and song writer, working at a Hollywood club ""The Bourbon Room,"" owned by Dennis Dupree (Alec Baldwin). The young couple is both likable, and their songs are not bad, but the story is thin, and their characters are bland and hardly fleshed out.Tom Cruise plays a washed-out rocker Stacee Jaxx. I was not impressed with the vamped-up version of a stereotypical rock star image itself, but Tom Cruise does it with an energy and zeal that is infectious. He steals not only scenes, but the entire film, relegating the romance and success story of the main characters to an unmemorable subplot. Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand as the club's manager are also very good, generating some laughs with a few comical dialogues.Paul Giamatti plays his sleazy manager Paul Gill. Malin kerman is an outspoken Rolling Stone reporter Constance Sack, a ""love interest"" of the legendary rock star. Catherine Zeta-Jones is overzealous Patricia Whitmore protesting against the rock (reference to the 1985 Senatorial hearings). They all turn in deliberately over-the-top performances that are apt for the film's setting, but not good enough to make the film a memorable one.After all, we - or most of the target audience - still remember the passion and energy of the 80s rock, and the overlong and unfocused film simply does not have it.

Characters are over the top and do ridiculous things but it makes you laugh. What really hurts the movie is that it goes a little too hardcore. It may have worked better if it were more family-friendly. Instead we have strippers who dont show the goods. Female fans and groupies showing the goods but the camera not peeking. Men kissing each other. Seriously, this movie doesn't know what it wants to be. Either go full blown ""R"" and give the adults what they want, or soften it up and get the parents to buy tickets for their kids. Instead its just a tease and pisses everyone off.Anyways, Tom Cruise steals the show with his Stacie Jaxx character, who really is the main player in the movie. Everyone and everything revolves around this character in the movie from the two main characters moving to LA, The survival of the club, etc. The two ""main stars"" of the movie (Julianne Hugh and Diego Bolenta) are basically there to show how Stacie Jaxx got so f'ed up and the poor decisions he made, so I see the importance of their parts. Other characters could be cut altogether and nobody would notice. The main problem with this movie is that its WAY too long. Over 2 hours? Really? First of all, we can get rid of the Mayor and Catherine Zeta Jones character completely. That would cut out a solid 15-20 minutes. Those story lines are not needed at all and waste time. Russell Brand isnt needed either. Im not even sure why he is there other than to give Alec Baldwin someone to talk to? Brand would have another 10 minutes or so cut from the film. That would take it to 90-100 minutes. More doable, and nothing would change!Watch the movie for the cool soundtrack and Tom Cruise as Stacie Jaxx. If you have seen him in Tropic Thunder then you know how awesome Cruise can be in these over-the-top characters.",3,"Fun, but overstayed its welcome",1351382400,"10 28, 2012",2012,1885,"['movie', 'fun', 'stupid', 'funny', 'way', 'kinda', 'Dumb', 'Dumber', 'Characters', 'are', 'top', 'do', 'ridiculous', 'things', 'laugh', 'What', 'really', 'movie', 'little', 'too', 'hardcore', 'may', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'were', 'more', 'family-friendly', 'Instead', 'have', 'strippers', 'who', 'dont', 'show', 'goods', 'Female', 'fans', 'groupies', 'showing', 'goods', 'camera', 'not', 'peeking', 'Men', 'kissing', 'other', 'Seriously', 'movie', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'be', 'go', 'full', 'blown', 'R', 'give', 'adults', 'what', 'want', 'soften', 'up', 'get', 'parents', 'buy', 'tickets', 'kids', 'Instead', 'just', 'tease', 'everyone', 'off.Anyways', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'show', 'Stacie', 'Jaxx', 'character', 'who', 'really', 'main', 'player', 'movie', 'Everyone', 'everything', 'revolves', 'character', 'movie', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'moving', 'LA', 'survival', 'club', 'etc', 'two', 'main', 'stars', 'movie', 'Julianne', 'Hugh', 'Diego', 'Bolenta', 'are', 'basically', 'there', 'show', 'how', 'Stacie', 'Jaxx', 'got', 'so', ""f'ed"", 'up', 'poor', 'decisions', 'made', 'see', 'importance', 'parts', 'Other', 'characters', 'could', 'be', 'cut', 'altogether', 'nobody', 'would', 'notice', 'main', 'problem', 'movie', 'WAY', 'too', 'long', '2', 'hours', 'Really', 'First', 'all', 'can', 'get', 'rid', 'Mayor', 'Catherine', 'Zeta', 'Jones', 'character', 'completely', 'would', 'cut', 'out', 'solid', '15-20', 'minutes', 'story', 'lines', 'are', 'not', 'needed', 'waste', 'time', 'Russell', 'Brand', 'isnt', 'needed', 'either', 'Im', 'not', 'even', 'sure', 'why', 'there', 'other', 'give', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'someone', 'talk', 'Brand', 'would', 'have', '10', 'minutes', 'so', 'cut', 'film', 'would', 'take', '90-100', 'minutes', 'More', 'doable', 'nothing', 'would', 'change', 'Watch', 'movie', 'cool', 'soundtrack', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Stacie', 'Jaxx', 'have', 'seen', 'Tropic', 'Thunder', 'then', 'know', 'how', 'awesome', 'Cruise', 'can', 'be', 'over-the-top', 'characters']",N/A
