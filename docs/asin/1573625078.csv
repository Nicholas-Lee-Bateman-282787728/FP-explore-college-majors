Of course the back is all in a language that I can't understand, but it's great if you can grab it.The film's pretty dodgy, but that's understandable, when it's a very early, almost TV film. Keanu Reeves is pretty much terrific, apart from his hair, and his dancing! OK, so he was pretty much high as a kite at the time, but if I'd been Lori Loughlin's character, I would walked out of there, no matter how cute he was! The dancing is pretty hilarious though, and the film should be seen for that alone.Otherwise, it's a pretty average film. Not good, but not bad either. It is quite a romantic movie, but it's also extremely predictable. Good, popular girl at school falls for geeky, science class boy?!

190407,A73W74K50GYRV,1573625078,PFunkster,"[1, 1]","The soundtrack alone is worth buying this movie for.  When I first saw this movie, I didn't know who PFunk was.  I did know, however, that I was hearing music I wanted to listen to again and again.  Now, PFunk is my favorite group and I can seriously say that Take Me Down Now  Baby Boy and Where The Music Comes Alive are two of the funkiest songs that I have ever heard.  Unfortunately, outside of this movie, I don't think either song has ever  been released.  In addition to doing most of the soundtrack, PFunk also  makes a cameo.  George, Bootsy and Gary are all present but they're in the  background.  While PFunk fans will want to see more of them, their  background cameos only help to make this movie work.  Unlike some of the  other movies PFunk has been in, this movie is also worth watching on it's  own merit.  I can comfortably recommend everything about this movie.  The  plot is excellent and the cast works really well.  If I tell any more about it, I'll spoil it.  If you're a PFunk fan and you haven't seen this movie, go to a video store and rent it!  I'll be surprised if you get to the end of the movie before you're back online buying it.  I look forward to the day when this movie is released on DVD.  It deserves to be.
