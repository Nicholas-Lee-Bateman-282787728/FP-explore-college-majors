These include a goat jumping from a cliff in order to escape a farmer suffering from Zoophilia and a peasant woman seducing a man with mental retardation.  Where it gets boring is the introduction of romance between a princess and an alien.  The film at this point just begins to take itself too seriously; if it had remained a farce how much more enjoyable the film might have been.,2,A Comedy That Becomes A Staid Romance,1382140800,"10 19, 2013",2013,452,"['are', 'sections', 'beginning', 'film', 'are', 'hilarious', 'include', 'goat', 'jumping', 'cliff', 'order', 'escape', 'farmer', 'suffering', 'Zoophilia', 'peasant', 'woman', 'seducing', 'man', 'mental', 'retardation', 'Where', 'boring', 'introduction', 'romance', 'princess', 'alien', 'film', 'point', 'just', 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'had', 'remained', 'farce', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'been']",N/A

This movie must have been filmed in Spain a number of years ago. It was funny like a Monty Python type of movie. Harvey Kitel must be willing to appear in almost any type of film. The quality was really poor, the Alien and his Dragon spaceship I suppose were different from recent Alien movies I watch, he was a spaceman who resembled David Bowie. It was really a dumb movie.

He doesn't strike me as a classical actor so the role was a bit off. Redone today it might have more stability for the story line which is nothing short of alien in King Arthurs court.The mute alien is played by Miguel Bose, who if you aren't an international music fan, is a tremendous latin singer and musician.

778188,A27JAIYP0U9FGH,B0000DCYQY,PJR,"[7, 13]","The film is a faiure as normal entertainment for normal people. But I am glad it is now on DVD and will not be forgotten. You may appreciate it if you are a very particular type of person with particular cerebral ways of looking at things.The premise is really delicious and there are three great actors to watch interacting. So that might interest you. Then there is the question of why it failed. If you like to puzzle artistic/commercial mistakes of differences in cultural artistic receptions then it may interest you.The premise of the story is great. Do you know the saying, ""When a pickpocket looks at a saint all he sees is the saint's pockets""? This psychological fact of how we see the world through personal filters is taken to a creative extreme in this film. If you are not sensitive to this flaw in human nature, this film may not resonate with you at all.An alien vehicle crashes in the middle ages. The knight sees it as some sort of dragon that he must fight. The cleric sees it as an evil spirit. The Alchemist/philosopher sees it in his terms.Then they all try to deal with it additionally in terms of the power struggles between them. And of course the middle ages was characterized by power struggles and alliances between the military class, the church, and men of ""reason"" or primitive ""pre-science.""If you think of it this way you may find a lot of cute tongue in cheek humor in their interactions. It is three blind men running their hands over an elephant and fighting with each other at the same time. In this sense it is an interesting way to comment on human nature by using an outlandish fictional device.So how could they fail? For one thing they try to ham it up too much in my opinion as though they had no faith that the audience could find the humor in in on their own. Fair enough. But for me at least the hamming it up did not work. The dialogue and acting are commonly stilted as though that will make it funny, but it comes across as poor quality. Several voices are dubbed and that may be part of the problem. Harvey Keitel makes little if any effort to cover his New York accent.This is supposed to remind us that this is a comedy?In fairness, I really think that for most people it actually would not have been clear that this was meant to be a sarcastic commentary on human stupidity unless the producers tried to make it into a rather obvious comedy.I imagine that if Bunuel or Almodovar had done this they would have let the humor speak for itself, but either can get away with that for several reasons.I bought the VHS for $1 back when out of curiosity and it was indeed a curiosity. The box says that it was directed by Spanish director Fernando Colomo. I don't know his other many films, but I would guess that he is one of those Spanish directors then experimenting with surrealism in film. The Spanish appreciate surrealism in film more than Americans do. These sorts of artistic experiments are interesting to me, even when I don't find them entertaining. I see that he has won some awards and that some of his films have gotten high Amazon ratings. Several are not availabe in zone 1, so probably he is better known in Europe.It also seems that unless you are an American who is a history buff, the comic aspects of people with different world views fighting and trying awkwardly to work together might not jump out at you with force.I see in this film a director who was willing to take some chances and I would be curious find out more about how his career developed.I doubt that many viewers will find this film entertaining. But if you can be forgiving of experimental films with awkward aspects you might just find this film worth watching. I give it an A for concept, a B for effort and a D if I try to imagine watching it from the perspective of the average American viewer, unless he has found some drugs that I can't think of.",3,A precious failure,1199318400,"01 3, 2008",2008,3887,"['film', 'faiure', 'normal', 'entertainment', 'normal', 'people', 'am', 'glad', 'now', 'DVD', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'forgotten', 'may', 'appreciate', 'are', 'very', 'particular', 'type', 'person', 'particular', 'cerebral', 'ways', 'looking', 'things.The', 'premise', 'really', 'delicious', 'are', 'three', 'great', 'actors', 'watch', 'interacting', 'might', 'interest', 'Then', 'question', 'why', 'failed', 'like', 'puzzle', 'artistic/commercial', 'mistakes', 'differences', 'cultural', 'artistic', 'receptions', 'then', 'may', 'interest', 'you.The', 'premise', 'story', 'great', 'Do', 'know', 'saying', 'When', 'pickpocket', 'saint', 'all', 'saint', 'pockets', 'psychological', 'fact', 'how', 'see', 'world', 'personal', 'filters', 'taken', 'creative', 'extreme', 'film', 'are', 'not', 'sensitive', 'flaw', 'human', 'nature', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'resonate', 'all.An', 'alien', 'vehicle', 'crashes', 'middle', 'ages', 'knight', 'sort', 'dragon', 'must', 'fight', 'cleric', 'evil', 'spirit', 'Alchemist/philosopher', 'terms.Then', 'try', 'deal', 'additionally', 'terms', 'power', 'course', 'middle', 'ages', 'was', 'characterized', 'power', 'struggles', 'alliances', 'military', 'class', 'church', 'men', 'reason', 'primitive', 'pre-science', 'think', 'way', 'may', 'find', 'lot', 'cute', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'humor', 'interactions', 'three', 'men', 'running', 'hands', 'elephant', 'fighting', 'other', 'same', 'time', 'sense', 'interesting', 'way', 'comment', 'human', 'nature', 'using', 'outlandish', 'fictional', 'device.So', 'how', 'could', 'fail', 'one', 'thing', 'try', 'ham', 'up', 'too', 'much', 'opinion', 'had', 'faith', 'audience', 'could', 'find', 'humor', 'own', 'Fair', 'enough', 'least', 'hamming', 'up', 'did', 'not', 'work', 'dialogue', 'acting', 'are', 'commonly', 'stilted', 'will', 'make', 'funny', 'poor', 'quality', 'Several', 'voices', 'are', 'dubbed', 'may', 'be', 'part', 'problem', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'little', 'effort', 'cover', 'New', 'York', 'accent.This', 'supposed', 'remind', 'comedy', 'fairness', 'really', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'actually', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'clear', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'sarcastic', 'commentary', 'human', 'stupidity', 'producers', 'tried', 'make', 'rather', 'obvious', 'comedy.I', 'imagine', 'Bunuel', 'Almodovar', 'had', 'done', 'would', 'have', 'let', 'humor', 'speak', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'several', 'reasons.I', 'bought', 'VHS', '1', 'back', 'when', 'out', 'curiosity', 'was', 'indeed', 'curiosity', 'box', 'was', 'directed', 'Spanish', 'director', 'Fernando', 'Colomo', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'other', 'many', 'films', 'would', 'guess', 'one', 'Spanish', 'directors', 'then', 'experimenting', 'surrealism', 'film', 'Spanish', 'appreciate', 'surrealism', 'film', 'more', 'Americans', 'do', 'sorts', 'artistic', 'experiments', 'are', 'interesting', 'even', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'entertaining', 'see', 'won', 'awards', 'films', 'have', 'gotten', 'high', 'Amazon', 'ratings', 'Several', 'are', 'not', 'availabe', 'zone', '1', 'so', 'probably', 'better', 'known', 'Europe.It', 'also', 'are', 'American', 'who', 'history', 'buff', 'comic', 'aspects', 'people', 'different', 'world', 'views', 'fighting', 'trying', 'awkwardly', 'work', 'together', 'might', 'not', 'jump', 'out', 'force.I', 'see', 'film', 'director', 'who', 'was', 'willing', 'take', 'chances', 'would', 'be', 'curious', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'how', 'career', 'developed.I', 'doubt', 'many', 'viewers', 'will', 'find', 'film', 'entertaining', 'can', 'be', 'forgiving', 'experimental', 'films', 'awkward', 'aspects', 'might', 'just', 'find', 'film', 'watching', 'give', 'A', 'concept', 'B', 'effort', 'D', 'try', 'imagine', 'watching', 'perspective', 'average', 'American', 'viewer', 'found', 'drugs', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think']",N/A
778189,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B0000DCYQY,Robert I. Hedges,"[1, 2]","""Star Knight"", made in the mid 80's in Spain as ""El Caballero del Drag&oacute;n"", is predictable, pretentious, and ponderous, while simultaneously being ridiculous and silly. Starring Harvey Keitel and Klaus Kinski among a cast of thousands of other people you've never heard of, the film is about a man in a space suit who comes to earth in a giant UFO and falls in love with a medieval princess, creating an awkward love triangle. This, of course, sets up the film to have the humans of old think the UFO is a dragon, and through much telepathic conversation (and contrived exposition) leads to what may be the most ridiculous duel in screen history. The special effects are laughable (I especially like the ""glowing head"" effect), although the costumes are interesting.The film has many lessons to teach: don't swim toward a giant whirlpool in a lake, for instance; stuff you would have never known on your own. The dialogue is terrible and very stilted (""Don't you know there's a dragon around here that devours goats, women, and children?"") and the direction is unskilled. The emphasis afforded non-pertinent things is very distracting: why does the movie open with Matilda the flying goat (really)? Why the prolonged hysterical overreaction to a black cat? I know they were alleged to bring bad luck, but this cat gets a reception that is truly over the top.The film is terribly unfocused, and the pace is plodding. The director decides the film should be a light comedy for brief scenes on several occasions, squandering whatever suspense it was able to muster. The most outlandish comedic gems are courtesy of The Green Knight, a.k.a. the worst knight ever in history: he is gross buffoonery personified. This confusing melding (it's kind of like ""Alien"" meets ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"") of fantasy adventure epic, love story, and farce actually made me consider giving the film two stars for camp value, that is until I saw the end of the film. Not only does the conclusion of the film predictably prove that love overcomes all (even a need for a non-oxygen based atmosphere), but that two idiots and mid-1980's animation do not mix in outer space.""Star Knight"" has something to make anyone groan, and I can't recommend it, unless you have a very strong stomach for quirky camp films.",1,"""Come Out Ye Dastardly Pultroon!

Meanwhile, the dowdy Princess Alba is bored and decides to sneak out of the castle.
