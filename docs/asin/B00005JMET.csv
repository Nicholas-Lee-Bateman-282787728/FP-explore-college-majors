617171,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B00005JMET,Alex Udvary,"[1, 2]","The ""screwball"" comedy has died. But I enjoy seeing a really good one. I think my favorite might be ""The Awful Truth"" a movie that the Coen's seemed to have been inspired by. But unlike films such as ""The Awful Truth"" or ""His Girl Friday"", ""My Man Godfrey"" and ""Bringing Up Baby"" ""Intolerable Cruelty"" doesn't seem to have that charm. The movie is not as witty as those older movies. Granted I did enjoy the performances by George Clooney (who I think is in pitch perfect Cary Grant mode) and Catherine Zeta-Jones (in a role I guess 50 years ago would have gone to Irene Dunne or Myrna Loy). And I even consider myself a fan of the Coen brothers. I've seen almost all of their movies. But I've never felt their strenght lies in their wit. They make movies that have a quirky off-beat charm and originality to them. Sure many times I laugh when watching their movies. I enjoy ""Miller's Crossing"" and ""The Man Who Wasn't There"", but I'm not sure if the Coen's were actually the correct choice for such a project. As pointed out by others the material doesn't seem to suit their style of film-making.""Intolerable Cruelty"" starts off with Donovan Donally (Geoffrey Rush) divorcing his wife, who was cheating on him. She goes after Miles Massey (Clooney) to represent her during the divorce, of course he wins the case for her. Fast forward, we meet Rex Rexroth (Edward Herrmann) who is married to Marylin (Jones). He is cheating on her. Only problem for him is, she finds out. He gets Massey to represent him and guess what happens. Yep, he falls for Marylin. It has the possibilities to make a great old-fashioned ""screwball comedy"" only the movie never quite reaches the hits it could have. I was left disappointed. Maybe I brought it on myself. Perhaps I walked into the movie with such high expectations that the movie never could have lived up to them. I was expecting to be enchanted by the wonderful witty tongue and cheek humor. I was prepared to love the characters and be amazed by the chemistry between Clooney and Jones. And I wanted to be able to tell everyone this is one of the best movies I've seen this year and one of the Coen's best. But if I said most of those things, I'd be lying. The movie leaves much to be desired.Now I don't want people to think I'm bashing the Coen brothers because I don't like them. That's not true. I am a fan. I think ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" was one fo the best films of 2001. ""Miller's Crossing"" is my favorite of their movies. I got a kick out of ""Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?"" and ""Fargo"". But ""Intolerable Cruelty"" just doesn't quite deliver. It doesn't seem to have the fun movies like ""The Awful Truth"" or ""His Girl Friday"" had. It's admirable but nothing great.Bottom-line: Weak Coen brothers comedy. Doesn't seem as quirky as the rest of their films and doesn't compare to older ""screwball comedies"" of the past.

I mean, you take two of the worlds most charming stars (Clooney and Zeta-Jones) and pair them with two of the worlds most intriguing and visionary filmmakers (those darn Coen brothers) and you'd expect something magical, or at least TOLERABLE.  Instead, you are handed a hot mess of unfunny moments and boredom inducing pandering.  The Coen's have always been hit or miss, but I don't think they have ever missed this extremely.  When you consider their magnificent work on films like `Fargo' and `Raising Arizona' (which somewhat fall in this cinematic genre) then you'd expect them to understand how to build a comedy this `subtle', but instead this film falls all sorts of short.  Stay far away from this mess.  I guess I'll never really understand the draw of this film.

617175,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B00005JMET,Andy Orrock,"[1, 1]","The zany relationship between George Clooney and Catherine Zeta-Jones in the Coen Brothers' 'Intolerable Cruelty' never really sparks, and that's a big flaw in a film that is meant to revive the Cary Grant-like screwball romantic comedies of the 30s and 40s.That's not saying that 'Cruelty' isn't a guilty pleasure. Clooney shows great comedic chops here: Grant-like double takes in court; a ""Who's On First"" schtick with sidekick Wrigley (Paul Adelstein). Asked by their client if they've ""ever sat before the judge before,"" the two respond ""No, we sit after the judge."" This routine goes on for a minute or two, the poker-faced duo patiently explaining to a beffudled client the order of sitting. Very funny stuff.As for Catherine Zeta-Jones, she looks incredible here, but she's not really given a lot of dimension by the script. I feel like she maximized what she was given to work with.It's the top-notch supporting cast that really makes 'Cruelty' work. Most notably:a. The before mentioned Paul Adelstein as Miles Massey aide-de-camp Wrigley.b. Edward Herrmann as Zeta-Jones' soon-to-be-ex-husband Rex Rexroth - this is a role that really turns Herrmann's stuffy FDR-like image on his head. He's excellent here as a flummoxed ex with an odd train fetish.c. Cedric the Entertainer as detective/videographer Gus Petch - his catchphrase will have you laughing as will his little piece on the importance of staying in shape.d. Geoffrey Rush does an extended cameo at the beginning as a successful TV producer...a nice little appearance at the end teams him up unexpectedly with Cedric's Petch.e. Richard Jenkins - supporting player extraordinaire (check him out in 'Flirting With Disaster') excels as Massey's courtroom adversary Freddy Bender.f. Billy Bob Thortnon is flat-out great as Zeta-Jones 'husband' #2 Howard Doyle. I don't know what it is about Billy Bob - the smaller the role, the better he is. [Check out his mesmerizing turn in ""Love Actually.""] Upon meeting Clooney, he goes into this little bit (I can't recall *how* he ended up here, which is part of the fun) about how he was an Aggie, and he used to ""play a little tight end for A&M;"" and he was successful because he could ""squirt through the line."" I don't know if he ad-libbed that stuff, if the Coen brothers wrote it or what, but it's brilliantly delivered. It's completely apropos of nothing at the time, which - you realize later - is exactly the point. Here's to more Billy Bob.I also enjoyed the references to the ""Massey Pre-Nup."" As a plot device, this yielded a lot of yuks - especially when Thornton's Doyle eats a copy with barbeque sauce - and nice little swerves in the story line. Once the nature of the pre-nup is defined, the direction of the film pivots back and forth depending on who is perceived to have the Massey-defined 'advantage.' The constant reference to the 'Massey Pre-Nup' reminded me a lot of the Steve Martin classic 'Man With Two Brains' and Dr. Michael Hfuhruhurr's references to his renowned 'Cranial Screw Top' brain surgery.",4,Great Supporting Cast Makes 'Cruelty' Shine,1080518400,"03 29, 2004",2004,3036,"['zany', 'relationship', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'Coen', 'Brothers', ""'Intolerable"", 'Cruelty', 'never', 'really', 'sparks', 'big', 'flaw', 'film', 'meant', 'revive', 'Cary', 'Grant-like', 'screwball', 'romantic', 'comedies', '30s', '40s.That', 'not', 'saying', ""'Cruelty"", ""n't"", 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'Clooney', 'great', 'comedic', 'chops', 'here', 'Grant-like', 'double', 'court', 'Who', 'First', 'schtick', 'sidekick', 'Wrigley', 'Paul', 'Adelstein', 'Asked', 'client', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'sat', 'judge', 'two', 'respond', 'No', 'sit', 'judge', 'routine', 'minute', 'two', 'poker-faced', 'duo', 'patiently', 'explaining', 'beffudled', 'client', 'order', 'sitting', 'Very', 'funny', 'stuff.As', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'incredible', 'here', 'not', 'really', 'given', 'lot', 'dimension', 'script', 'feel', 'maximized', 'what', 'was', 'given', 'work', 'with.It', 'top-notch', 'supporting', 'cast', 'really', ""'Cruelty"", 'work', 'Most', 'notably', 'before', 'mentioned', 'Paul', 'Adelstein', 'Miles', 'Massey', 'aide-de-camp', 'Wrigley.b', 'Edward', 'Herrmann', 'Zeta-Jones', 'soon-to-be-ex-husband', 'Rex', 'Rexroth', 'role', 'really', 'Herrmann', 'stuffy', 'FDR-like', 'image', 'head', 'excellent', 'here', 'flummoxed', 'ex', 'odd', 'train', 'fetish.c', 'Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'detective/videographer', 'Gus', 'Petch', 'catchphrase', 'will', 'have', 'laughing', 'will', 'little', 'piece', 'importance', 'staying', 'shape.d', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'extended', 'cameo', 'beginning', 'successful', 'TV', 'producer', 'nice', 'little', 'appearance', 'end', 'teams', 'up', 'unexpectedly', 'Cedric', 'Petch.e', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'supporting', 'player', 'extraordinaire', 'check', 'out', ""'Flirting"", 'Disaster', 'excels', 'Massey', 'courtroom', 'adversary', 'Freddy', 'Bender.f', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thortnon', 'flat-out', 'great', 'Zeta-Jones', ""'husband"", '2', 'Howard', 'Doyle', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'smaller', 'role', 'better', '[', 'Check', 'mesmerizing', 'turn', 'Love', 'Actually', 'Upon', 'meeting', 'Clooney', 'little', 'bit', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', '*how*', 'ended', 'up', 'here', 'part', 'fun', 'how', 'was', 'Aggie', 'used', 'play', 'little', 'tight', 'end', 'A', 'M', 'was', 'successful', 'could', 'squirt', 'line', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'ad-libbed', 'stuff', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'wrote', 'what', 'brilliantly', 'delivered', 'completely', 'apropos', 'nothing', 'time', 'realize', 'later', 'exactly', 'point', 'Here', 'more', 'Billy', 'Bob.I', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'references', 'Massey', 'Pre-Nup', 'plot', 'device', 'yielded', 'lot', 'yuks', 'especially', 'when', 'Thornton', 'Doyle', 'copy', 'barbeque', 'sauce', 'nice', 'little', 'swerves', 'story', 'line', 'nature', 'pre-nup', 'defined', 'direction', 'film', 'pivots', 'back', 'forth', 'depending', 'who', 'perceived', 'have', 'Massey-defined', ""'advantage"", 'constant', 'reference', ""'Massey"", 'Pre-Nup', 'reminded', 'lot', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'classic', 'Two', 'Brains', 'Dr.', 'Michael', 'Hfuhruhurr', 'references', 'renowned', ""'Cranial"", 'Screw', 'Top', 'brain', 'surgery']",Intolerable Cruelty

617180,A34PAZQ73SL163,B00005JMET,"Bernard Chapin ""Ora Et Labora!""","[2, 3]","In order to enjoy this movie it is necessary for one, almost immediately, to suspend their disbelief as California was the state that pioneered no fault divorce. Unfortunately, it seems like the only people who haven't heard about it are the Coen brothers. Therefore, the bad news is that most of the plot is entirely implausible as it doesn't matter who cheated on whom or what they did during the relationship. That being said I still found Intolerable Cruelty to be tremendously enjoyable and fun to watch. Yes, it is a step down for the Coen brothers who have produced the greatest movies of the past two decades this side of Martin Scorsese. Certainly it is no Miller's Crossing but what else could be? Particularly provocative is its take on gold digging women which is very politically correct as it shows Zeta-Jones and her clique to be parasites and systematic exploiters of men. This take on male-female relations (at that particular socio-economic level) is rife with truth and far truer than the politically correct precept that women are victims. Actually, we find that these ladies to be quite empowered even if it is in the fashion of Bluebeard. The movie is a convincing reproduction of real life at the psychological, as opposed to legal, level which is another reason why I must recommend it. As for Clooney, he's absolutely excellent here. I don't think his performance could have been improved on by any other actor.

617182,A29QM4M1KVTWVF,B00005JMET,Bitter Bunny,"[1, 1]","I've been a fan of the Coen brothers since their film `Blood Simple' but oddly, I just watched their film `Intolerable Cruelty'. Why did it take me 9 years to watch? Perhaps it has to do with the fact that neither Clooney or Zeta-Jones are my favorite actors nor do I consider looks a necessary ingredient for getting my fanny in a movie seat.One consideration in a film like this, and one which I was concerned with, has to do with the chemistry between the main actors - Clooney and Zeta-Jones. Everything supporting the reasons for their union is all riding on their interaction. Do they pull it off? Well, yes and no.Let me preface this by first saying that the characters were clearly written as caricatures - I wouldn't be surprised to hear these were based on people the Coen brothers knew in real life. So given this, a question is posed to the audience about interpreting their brand of on-screen `love'. Can we empathize with them knowing certain exaggerations are taking place? For the most part, no - the action is played out as you would imagine a Coen brothers film to develop (think Raising Arizona) and yet, amidst the comedic farce and far-fetched storytelling, this film manages to capture a couple of honest moments that give you pause to consider the zany, sometimes ludicrous scenario played out on screen isn't that far from reality. These `real' moments are nice when they occur because they step aside from `tongue-in-cheek' action to illustrate just how reality is strange and wonderful in its own right.The supporting cast is well rounded and adept at performing their requisite parts right on cue, especially Paul Adelstein - Clooney's sidekick buddy. Zeta-Jones' comedic timing was somewhat off. She seems to lack an effort at making fun of her role instead of trying to look perfect. Perhaps she forgot she was in a comedy. The moral that is hinted at, yet not fully developed, is `what good is wealth without love?' and whether you buy this or not largely depends on your definition of `love'. For instance, Clooney's character seems to be in `love' with the challenge of getting a girl he considers unforgettable, rather than feeling an intimate closeness to a person he can nurture a relationship with. He is simply captivated by a heavenly creature much like Gene Wilder was captivated by a woman in red in the film `The Woman in Red'. However, to compare these two films of infidelity/adultery would be like comparing a Sony Walkman to an Apple Ipod. Suffice to say that love, lust or like will get us all in trouble at some point in our lives. It's only natural, so make sure to laugh out loud when it happens.Bottom line: Does the film advance cinema to the next level. No Rosebud, sorry. Is it a fun ride? Sure, if you think poking infidelity in the eye can be humorous. Will it bring you closer to reaching Nirvana? It depends - If people can find salvation & forgiveness after praying to a faint image of a deity on a tortilla, I wouldn't rule out becoming enlightened after watching the film.  I gave it 3 stars because the film is entertaining, stylish and it doesn't portend to preach about religious values or loose morals.",3,"Comes up to a low boil, but sparks fail to completely fly.",1336348800,"05 7, 2012",2012,3166,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'film', 'Blood', 'Simple', 'oddly', 'just', 'watched', 'film', 'Intolerable', 'Cruelty', 'Why', 'did', 'take', '9', 'years', 'watch', 'Perhaps', 'do', 'fact', 'Clooney', 'Zeta-Jones', 'are', 'favorite', 'actors', 'do', 'consider', 'necessary', 'ingredient', 'getting', 'fanny', 'movie', 'seat.One', 'consideration', 'film', 'one', 'was', 'concerned', 'do', 'chemistry', 'main', 'actors', 'Clooney', 'Zeta-Jones', 'Everything', 'supporting', 'reasons', 'union', 'riding', 'interaction', 'Do', 'pull', 'off', 'Well', 'yes', 'no.Let', 'preface', 'first', 'saying', 'characters', 'were', 'clearly', 'written', 'caricatures', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'hear', 'were', 'based', 'people', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'knew', 'real', 'life', 'So', 'given', 'question', 'posed', 'audience', 'interpreting', 'brand', 'on-screen', 'love', 'Can', 'empathize', 'knowing', 'certain', 'exaggerations', 'are', 'taking', 'place', 'most', 'part', 'action', 'played', 'out', 'would', 'imagine', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'film', 'develop', 'think', 'Raising', 'Arizona', 'yet', 'comedic', 'farce', 'far-fetched', 'storytelling', 'film', 'capture', 'couple', 'honest', 'moments', 'give', 'pause', 'consider', 'zany', 'sometimes', 'ludicrous', 'scenario', 'played', 'out', 'screen', ""n't"", 'far', 'reality', 'real', 'moments', 'are', 'nice', 'when', 'occur', 'step', 'aside', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'action', 'illustrate', 'just', 'how', 'reality', 'strange', 'wonderful', 'own', 'right.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'well', 'rounded', 'adept', 'performing', 'requisite', 'parts', 'right', 'cue', 'especially', 'Paul', 'Adelstein', 'Clooney', 'sidekick', 'buddy', 'Zeta-Jones', 'comedic', 'timing', 'was', 'somewhat', 'off', 'lack', 'effort', 'making', 'fun', 'role', 'instead', 'trying', 'look', 'perfect', 'Perhaps', 'forgot', 'was', 'comedy', 'moral', 'hinted', 'yet', 'not', 'fully', 'developed', 'what', 'good', 'wealth', 'love', 'buy', 'not', 'largely', 'definition', 'love', 'instance', 'Clooney', 'character', 'be', 'love', 'challenge', 'getting', 'girl', 'unforgettable', 'rather', 'feeling', 'intimate', 'closeness', 'person', 'can', 'nurture', 'relationship', 'simply', 'captivated', 'heavenly', 'creature', 'much', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'was', 'captivated', 'woman', 'red', 'film', 'Woman', 'Red', 'However', 'compare', 'two', 'films', 'infidelity/adultery', 'would', 'be', 'comparing', 'Sony', 'Walkman', 'Apple', 'Ipod', 'Suffice', 'say', 'love', 'lust', 'like', 'will', 'get', 'trouble', 'point', 'lives', 'only', 'natural', 'so', 'make', 'sure', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'when', 'happens.Bottom', 'line', 'film', 'advance', 'cinema', 'next', 'level', 'Rosebud', 'sorry', 'fun', 'ride', 'Sure', 'think', 'poking', 'infidelity', 'eye', 'can', 'be', 'humorous', 'Will', 'bring', 'closer', 'reaching', 'Nirvana', 'people', 'can', 'find', 'salvation', 'forgiveness', 'praying', 'faint', 'image', 'deity', 'tortilla', 'would', ""n't"", 'rule', 'out', 'becoming', 'enlightened', 'watching', 'film', 'gave', '3', 'stars', 'film', 'entertaining', 'stylish', ""n't"", 'portend', 'preach', 'about', 'religious', 'values', 'loose', 'morals']",Intolerable Cruelty

George Clooney, Catherine Zeta-Jones, et al give their roles energy and sparkle.  The story line is like watching a ball of snakes all trying to eat each other and mate at the same time.  Except that these snakes are all obsessed with cosmetic surgery.Miles Massey (Clooney) is a supremely successful divorce attorney who wins impossible settlements for his clients while crushing the other side without regard to facts, truth, or even ethics.  Marylin (Zeta-Jones) is a gold digger who wants a divorce settlement to provide her with independence.  Unfortunately for her she ends up on the wrong side of Massey the first time they meet.  What she does about that crushing experience is the rest of the movie, which I can't talk about here.In spite of the virtues the movie has in performance, it lacks some sparkle in the screenplay.  With characters this cynical the movie needs to delight in its sheer all conquering wit to draw you in.  As it is, this movie, while entertaining and funny, still left me feeling a bit outside of it all.  If you like Clooney and/or Zeta-Jones then you will at least have a couple of hours looking at them.  However, if you are looking for something wonderful, look elsewhere.

The Coen Brothers have produced a no holds barred comedy, and from start to finish their savage satirical wit finds it mark, producing one memorable scene and set of belly laughs after another.George Clooney gives a fantastic performance as a top-notch Los Angeles divorce attorney, a role which allows him to show just how much acting goes into being a good attorney.  Catherine Zeta-Jones doesn't have quite as meaty a part, but she gives an alluring performance.  In the supporting roles, Billy Bob Thornton gets to dust off his Texas accent, and creates a credible happy-go-lucky Texas oilman.  But the best supporting role is that of the senior partner of Clooney's law firm, an octogenarian representative of the legal profession who has long ago lost all traces of his humanity and soul.The dialogue is finely honed, with barbs minor and major liberally sprinkled throughout.  The plot is intricate and requires some thought to follow, as well as the suspension of a minor amount of disbelief, but it all makes sense within the logic of the film.

There is a lot of homage to those films and Clooney and Zeta-Jones seem up to the task, but then the film takes a somewhat darker turn and loses a ton of steam.  I don't know if I've ever seen a hybrid black comedy/screwball but this isn't it.  They try, but they don't succeed.The script is also haphazard.  I may be wrong, but I believe this is the first film the Coens have written in conjunction with another writing team and from a story not original to them.  It shows.  It's not quite convoluted, and like any Coen film there are little quirks and tricks that show up along the way, but there are things that just don't seem to have any purpose.  The opening sequence with Geoffrey Rush is funny, but has no relevance to the rest of the plot save for one very, very brief moment in the middle and another at the end.There are, however, some redeeming qualities.  As with most Coen films, the cinematography by Roger Deakins is phenomenal.  There are several very funny slapstick moments, most involving Clooney, and Billy Bob Thornton has a funny part.  Zeta-Jones seems to play the put-upon scheming tough-as-nails type well but she actually seems to suffer next to Clooney's mugging and broad comedic gestures.Overall it gets 3 stars for the sheer star power of Clooney and Zeta-Jones, for the effort to revive the screwball genre, and because the Coens at least keep things interesting, if not always entertaining.",3,Intolerable Cruelty = Identity Crisis,1081382400,"04 8, 2004",2004,1980,"['surface', 'containing', 'elements', 'good', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'etc', 'Intolerable', 'Cruelty', 'suffers', 'most', 'basic', 'problem', 'namely', 'so', 'unsure', 'what', 'kind', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'up', 'failing', 'most', 'part', 'board.At', 'first', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'update', 'classic', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'given', 'setup', 'Clooney', 'THE', 'divorce', 'attorney', 'Zeta-Jones', 'woman', 'who', 'husbands', 'bank', 'accounts', 'lot', 'homage', 'films', 'Clooney', 'Zeta-Jones', 'seem', 'up', 'task', 'then', 'film', 'somewhat', 'darker', 'turn', 'ton', 'steam', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'hybrid', 'black', 'comedy/screwball', ""n't"", 'try', 'do', ""n't"", 'succeed.The', 'script', 'also', 'haphazard', 'may', 'be', 'wrong', 'believe', 'first', 'film', 'Coens', 'have', 'written', 'conjunction', 'writing', 'team', 'story', 'not', 'original', 'not', 'quite', 'convoluted', 'Coen', 'film', 'are', 'little', 'quirks', 'tricks', 'show', 'up', 'way', 'are', 'things', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'purpose', 'opening', 'sequence', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'funny', 'relevance', 'rest', 'plot', 'save', 'one', 'very', 'very', 'brief', 'moment', 'middle', 'are', 'however', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'most', 'Coen', 'films', 'cinematography', 'Roger', 'Deakins', 'phenomenal', 'are', 'several', 'very', 'funny', 'slapstick', 'moments', 'most', 'involving', 'Clooney', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'funny', 'part', 'Zeta-Jones', 'play', 'put-upon', 'scheming', 'tough-as-nails', 'type', 'well', 'actually', 'suffer', 'next', 'Clooney', 'mugging', 'broad', 'comedic', 'gestures.Overall', '3', 'stars', 'sheer', 'star', 'power', 'Clooney', 'Zeta-Jones', 'effort', 'revive', 'screwball', 'genre', 'Coens', 'least', 'keep', 'things', 'interesting', 'not', 'always', 'entertaining']",Intolerable Cruelty

617202,AYOPN5ABOAUER,B00005JMET,DavidRoss,"[3, 4]","Lighter and more conventional than the films establishing their reputation (BLOOD SIMPLE, MILLER'S CROSSING, FARGO, etc.), INTOLERABLE CRUELTY nevertheless signals the Coen brothers' return to form after recent disappointments.  Though the antagonists (played by George Clooney and Catherine Zeta-Jones) are outlandishly cynical, the movie itself is not.  No one is truly nasty in this story, only flawed (but deeply), and in true screwball tradition their innate human warmth endears them to us despite their mercenary attitudes toward love.  Zeta-Jones and Clooney's battle is like the battles between Russell & Grant in HIS GIRL FRIDAY, or Hepburn & Tracy in PAT & MIKE.  They never descend to the depraved meanspiritedness portrayed in deVito's WAR OF THE ROSES.Zeta-Jones is delicious, giving us more in the flickering light in her eyes than most actors give at their most histrionic.  (She's very nearly in William Hurt's class.)  And in Clooney's performance I finally see the incipient charm for which some have compared him (a bit optimistically) to Archibald Leach himself.  The supporting cast is top notch, too:  Herrmann, Rush, Cedric, Duffy, Royce Applegate, and Jonathan Hadary are all splendid in their little roles.  And Billy Bob Thornton finally gets to display his craft as a character actor again, coming through with a performance as fine as his faro-dealer in TOMBSTONE.The script is deft - - witty without calling attention to itself, which is no mean feat given characters equally conversant with Shakespeare and first-growth Bordeaux wines.  I especially admired Clooney's character's speech on love and marriage at the divorce lawyers' convention: emotional without sinking into sentimentality, morally focused but not preachy, a believable epiphany amidst farce.  It is good to see the Coen brothers doing again what no other filmmaker has done so consistently.  Perhaps they are the Aristophanes of our age.As for the star rating, I would give 3  stars if Amazon permitted, meaning that I liked more than a little even though it falls short of the Coens' best.  Their best is very good, however, nearing and sometimes reaching greatness.  And compared to the goblets of dreck usually served by Hollywood, INTOLERABLE CRUELTY is quite tolerable, surprisingly pleasing to the palate.  Not Chateau Margaux, to be sure, but not a jug of Red Mountain, either.  Perhaps this movie needs to breathe a bit after uncorking.  Somehow I suspect it will improve with age, thus give it the benefit of the doubt and award 4 stars instead of 3.",4,Farce with a heart - screwball comedy ala brothers Coen,1076457600,"02 11, 2004",2004,2558,"['Lighter', 'more', 'conventional', 'films', 'establishing', 'reputation', 'BLOOD', 'SIMPLE', 'MILLER', 'CROSSING', 'FARGO', 'etc', 'INTOLERABLE', 'CRUELTY', 'nevertheless', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'return', 'form', 'recent', 'disappointments', 'antagonists', 'played', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'are', 'outlandishly', 'cynical', 'movie', 'not', 'one', 'truly', 'nasty', 'story', 'only', 'flawed', 'deeply', 'true', 'screwball', 'tradition', 'innate', 'human', 'warmth', 'mercenary', 'attitudes', 'love', 'Zeta-Jones', 'Clooney', 'battle', 'battles', 'Russell', 'Grant', 'HIS', 'GIRL', 'FRIDAY', 'Hepburn', 'Tracy', 'PAT', 'MIKE', 'never', 'descend', 'depraved', 'meanspiritedness', 'portrayed', 'deVito', 'WAR', 'THE', 'ROSES.Zeta-Jones', 'delicious', 'giving', 'more', 'flickering', 'light', 'eyes', 'most', 'actors', 'give', 'most', 'histrionic', 'very', 'nearly', 'William', 'Hurt', 'class', 'Clooney', 'performance', 'finally', 'see', 'incipient', 'charm', 'have', 'compared', 'bit', 'optimistically', 'Archibald', 'Leach', 'supporting', 'cast', 'top', 'notch', 'too', 'Herrmann', 'Rush', 'Cedric', 'Duffy', 'Royce', 'Applegate', 'Jonathan', 'Hadary', 'are', 'splendid', 'little', 'roles', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'finally', 'display', 'craft', 'character', 'actor', 'again', 'coming', 'performance', 'as', 'fine', 'faro-dealer', 'TOMBSTONE.The', 'script', 'deft', 'witty', 'calling', 'attention', 'mean', 'feat', 'given', 'characters', 'equally', 'conversant', 'Shakespeare', 'first-growth', 'Bordeaux', 'wines', 'especially', 'admired', 'Clooney', 'character', 'speech', 'love', 'marriage', 'divorce', 'lawyers', 'convention', 'emotional', 'sinking', 'sentimentality', 'morally', 'focused', 'not', 'preachy', 'believable', 'epiphany', 'amidst', 'farce', 'good', 'see', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'doing', 'again', 'what', 'other', 'filmmaker', 'done', 'so', 'consistently', 'Perhaps', 'are', 'Aristophanes', 'age.As', 'star', 'rating', 'would', 'give', '3', 'stars', 'Amazon', 'permitted', 'meaning', 'liked', 'more', 'little', 'even', 'short', 'Coens', 'best', 'best', 'very', 'good', 'however', 'nearing', 'sometimes', 'reaching', 'greatness', 'compared', 'goblets', 'dreck', 'usually', 'served', 'Hollywood', 'INTOLERABLE', 'CRUELTY', 'quite', 'tolerable', 'surprisingly', 'pleasing', 'palate', 'Not', 'Chateau', 'Margaux', 'be', 'sure', 'not', 'jug', 'Red', 'Mountain', 'either', 'Perhaps', 'movie', 'breathe', 'bit', 'uncorking', 'Somehow', 'suspect', 'will', 'improve', 'age', 'thus', 'give', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'award', '4', 'stars', 'instead', '3']",Intolerable Cruelty

Well, I got the mean-spirited.The good news is that this definitely qualifies as black comedy; the bad news is that there is little excitement between Clooney and Zeta-Jones.  Please don't misunderstand- they're both good actors and manage to have chemistry with their scenery when needed; they just don't manage here to create any kind of magic or spark.  It's believable that they would be attracted to each other, if only on the basis of their looks, but that they would recognize within each other their perfect match (however unsavory that might be)?  It's just not there.Cleverness was also missing.  While the Las Vegas wedding with kilts and the poodle-stroking Baron were good for a few laughs, the general effect of the Coen gags were to make me pull back and watch as I shook my head at the unbelievable insanity of so many of the setups.  The overall effect was a little bit alienating, which was a shame since I was already having trouble buying into the characters.Another letdown was how generally uneven the film was.  It's tawdry- Zeta-Jones' ex-husband and his various mistresses; it's slightly adolescent- all of the screams (screams!) uttered by Clooney and his sidekick, as well as the gags with the pepper spray and the asthma medication; and it's surreal- the scenes in the courtroom and then the senior partner's office.  All of those elements could work in a better executed film, but here all of it seemed thrown together, with the final effect flat.This movie isn't without it's merits.

Ok, so it's not desperately bad, but is it just me or does this film seem like a completely pointless hour and a half? This is a romantic comedy without any romance, and any comedy. One of those films with such great potential, that falls down on a poor script that can barely manage some average 'smile' humour, and a few trite speeches about love and life that make you cringe rather than shed a tear. The film basically centres on a man-eating divorcee out for wealth and independence and a sharp divorce lawyer bored of money and independence who wants more from his life. They meet, some stuff happens, you're never sure who's doing who over, and who has the upper hand, and then they fall in love. Or do they? Etc etc. I really wanted to like this film and thought it had a lot of potential, but somehow it just doesn't work.

I enjoyed the movie from the very beginning. The another funny part is when Cedric is up to his ass-nailing job. The phrase ' I'm gonna nail yo' ass' is great in this movie to show exactly what he's doing. The part where Wheezy Joe(Irwin) try to shoot Miles Massey by using his asthma spray instead of the gun without himself realizing it is also another great part of comedy in this movie which makes me laugh endlessly while watching it. Well, such insident wouldn't happen in the real world for sure. Besides the funny part, the romance part is as well fantastic. Catherine Zeta-Jones and George Clooney fit in perfectly in this movie. They play the role of two highly social-ranked people in this movie. The way Catherine speaks makes her a charming women and Clooney expresses much self-confident in his dialogue. He managed to potray as a romantic divorce attorney like what he supposed to be. Clooney's line is outstanding especially in the court and while having a talk with Catherine's(Marylin) attorney. Personally, I think is good for Clooney to act in a romance-comedy movie as a well-behaved character(attorney) after all his movies where he potrays as a robber , kidnapper or a swindler( Out Of Sight, Dusk Till Dawn, Ocean""s Eleven). I was amazed when he speaks  to Catherine(Marylin) in literally lines(poem recitation) during the court session. Those lines are so nice and it holds the true meaning of what he's actually speaking. Catherine then also reply back in beatiful poetic verse which I admired. Overall, the story line of this movie is good with a fine plot. It shows the ups and downs of the two main character, Clooney(Miles Massey) and Catherine(Marylin Rexroth)as the movie goes on. The ending is as well wonderful. Miles(Clooney) stills willing to be with Marylin(Catherine) after all what they had been through( you stab my back and I stab yours)kind an incident really touched me. This ending gives the feeling of true love and romance despite the swindling of each other feeling. I must admit. It is a very good ending. The sondtrack of this movie is also not bad. I like this very much and I enjoy watching it over and over.

617209,A2WP0GOTX13MG4,B00005JMET,"DJK ver 2.0 ""Reader and Movie Buff""","[0, 0]","'Intolerable Cruelty' tells the story of a divorce attorney that has made a living protecting the livelihood of men that are being sued for divorce by their former spouses.  Miles Massey, played by George Clooney, however, is beginning to lose his taste for the work.  It all comes to a head when he finds himself falling for the former wife, Marilyn Rexroth (played by Catherine Zeta-Jones) of his most recent client.Marilyn has a dark secret of her own.  She and several friends have conceived plots to marry rich men, catch them in the act of cheating, and then to divorce them, taking with them half of their former husbands estates.  Like Massey, Ms. Rexroth finds herself in a bit of a dilemna, by achieving her goals she ends up being incredibly lonely.'Intolerable Cruelty' almost seems like a car made from spare parts of other movies.  The first third and last third of the movie form a chasis that incases a middle third that seems to be an engine not quite powerful enough to make the car go.  I thoroughly enjoyed Massey's cynicism towards divorce and the legal profession that come in the early parts of the movie, and the last third has some fun plot twists.  However, the middle third of the movie is just bizarre.  Many fans of the Coen brothers will not find this unusual, and will probably love it, but it just seemed to make the movie incoherent to me.Another element of the movie that just makes it surreal is the character of the senior partner.  Although the character's name escapes me, you'll know him when you see him.  He is a little withered old man kept alive by bottles of liquids that drain into his body.  He seems to reside in his office and never leaves.  Everytime you see him, he is spouting off Massey's accomplishments which range from hundreds of summary judgments to the impregnable Massey Pre-nup (which is a central plot element).  This character is precisely what Massey fears becoming.The movie does have a good cast.  Clooney is a Coen regular now, and was perfect for the part of Massey.  He delivered his scathing lines about the legal profession with the perfect amount of cynicism, sarcasm, and loathing, and his speech about keeping the flame of live alive when clients are seeking divorces at the NOMAN (a group of divorce attorneys) was heart felt.  However, his character loses it in the middle, and his performance suffers a bit.  Zeta-Jones was admirable as the calculating Ms. Rexroth and very consistent.  I elso enjoyed Billy Bob Thornton's character, which was kind of unique for me.Overall, the movie probably deserves about 3.5 stars, but its not quite worthy of four.  Coen brothers fans should like it well enough, but I doubt it'll be their favorite Coen brothers movie.  If you can't stand the Coen brothers, then you might as well stay away from this.  Its worth a rental at least.

""The Man Who Wasn't There"" is particular. I am also looking forwrd to their next movie ""The Ladykillers."" The reason that I liked this movie was because it was a different kind of movie that they would make. That is why alot of people thought it was bad. Can't a popular director try something different? You have to watch movies without comparing it to the director or actors past works. Watch a movie as if it's the first movie the director or actor ever made. That's the key to liking more movies. Don't compare! George Clooney and Catherine Zeta-Jones are the stars of ""Intolerable Cruelty."" This was the movie where I relized that Catherine Zeta-Jones is a very beautiful women. I've always known that, but this movie kind of made that more known. It could also be done on purpose to show how everybody is instantly attracted to her in the movie, or it could just be the truth.The movie starts with Donovan Donely who is a television producer for soap-operas. He walks into his home, and finds the pool guy in the house, which is strange because they don't have a pool. His wife is cheatings on him, and after his wife stabs him with something, he takes pictures of the wound, and then shoots after his wife as she drives away with the pool guy. His wife hires Miles Massey as her divorce lawyer, and although he has alot of evidence that she hurt him, he still gets her the most in the settlement and ruins Dovovans life. Heis unbeatable. When he meets Rex Rexroth however, he changes his whole aspect. Rex was cheating on his wife, and was caught by his wife Marylin's private eye Gus Petch. With her lawyer Freddy Bender she plans to get half of thr settlement. But Rex hired Miles to be his lawyer, and Miles gets a surprise witness Heinz, the Baron Krauss von Espy. After he ruins her live, Miles becomes scared that he is going to become a workaholiv like his old boss. He decides to persue the now single Marylin. But Marylin already has a new boyfriend by Southern oilman Howard Doyle. As Miles falls deeper and deeper into love with Marylin, it becomes to the point where a hitman may have to come into play in this screwball dark comedy.The only problem with this movie was that is was to legal. I still gave it five stars, but eventually I began to get a little confused with all of these legal terms and pre-nup talk. I, frankly, began to get a little sick of it. I still really did like it, and will also probally get the DVD of this movie.Richard Jenkins was in this movie as Marylin's lawyer. I really don't like him. I think he is a terrible actor and is just a waste of talent. But Geoffrey Rush is in the movie and I feel that he is one of the best actors of of time.

Or, maybe everybody else just missed it.  George Clooney is perfect as a lawyer who is, shall we say, a few writs short of a full briefcase.  He meets Catherine Zeta-Jones in a divorce case, and instantly and completely falls head over heels for her (and what lawyer wouldn't).  Even though he knows she is going to try to get his money, he thinks he has outsmarted her and pursues her anyway.  The plot twists and turns from there.  But it isn't the plot that makes this movie funny, it's the little things.  You've got to pay attention!  For example, when George Clooney gets married, the priest lists his law firm after his name.  This cracked me up.  Plus, the expressions on George Clooney's face are really funny, like his role in ""Brother, Where Art Thou?""  The characters are all somewhat exaggerated, and this separates ""Intolerable Cruelty"" from your average comedy.  This movie relies on a pretty brutal form of humor, in the same vein but not as rough as ""The Fortune Cookie.""  If you're able to let go of people being nice to each other, you'll be in the right mood for ""Intolerable Cruelty.""

Jennifer Jason Leigh nailed the Katherine Hepburn fast-talking New England sophisticate.  I laughed at Jason Leigh's performance more than I ever did at a Katherine Hepburn movie.Intolerable Cruelty is set in the present day, but its comedy evokes the Marx brothers of the thirties.  The minor characters are the rich morons (botoxed divorcee, loopy millionaire train enthusiast) that predated Preston Sturges-style pseudo-realism.  Imagine an anorexic Margaret Dumont.  And I would bet money the Coens were trying to make one character (a poodle-carrying European hotel major domo) look like Oscar Levant.The look of the film (and most of the acting) has a kind of sixties Batman winking at the audience style.  The senior partner in Miles Massey's law firm is a monster with tubes and wires connecting him to the world.  Clooney as Miles strikes poses and jokes even when he's the only person around.  Sometimes it's very funny, but Zeta-Jones plays Marylin Rexroth more straight and that might be why it seems to some that Clooney and Zeta-Jones don't click.My favorite scenes are when Miles fences with his legal opponents in conferences and in court.  I can hear Groucho's voice twisting people in knots.Intolerable Cruelty is entertaining, but Joel and Ethan Coen have set the bar so high for themselves with Blood Simple, Fargo, O Brother, Where Art Thou?, and The Man Who Wasn't There that I can't help feeling it was barely worth all the trouble.",3,Captain Spaulding Goes to Court,1076803200,"02 15, 2004",2004,1748,"['Intolerable', 'Cruelty', 'latest', 'Joel', 'Ethan', 'Coen', 'movie', 'starring', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'more', 'Coens', '1994', 'Hudsucker', 'Proxy', 'other', 'films.Hudsucker', 'was', 'parody', 'pastiche', 'like', 'genre', 'begin', 'forties', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'nailed', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'fast-talking', 'New', 'England', 'sophisticate', 'laughed', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'performance', 'more', 'ever', 'did', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'movie.Intolerable', 'Cruelty', 'set', 'present', 'day', 'comedy', 'Marx', 'brothers', 'thirties', 'minor', 'characters', 'are', 'rich', 'morons', 'botoxed', 'divorcee', 'loopy', 'millionaire', 'train', 'enthusiast', 'predated', 'Preston', 'Sturges-style', 'pseudo-realism', 'Imagine', 'anorexic', 'Margaret', 'Dumont', 'would', 'bet', 'money', 'Coens', 'were', 'trying', 'make', 'one', 'character', 'poodle-carrying', 'European', 'hotel', 'major', 'domo', 'look', 'Oscar', 'Levant.The', 'look', 'film', 'most', 'acting', 'kind', 'sixties', 'Batman', 'winking', 'audience', 'style', 'senior', 'partner', 'Miles', 'Massey', 'law', 'firm', 'monster', 'tubes', 'wires', 'connecting', 'world', 'Clooney', 'Miles', 'poses', 'jokes', 'even', 'when', 'only', 'person', 'around', 'very', 'funny', 'Zeta-Jones', 'Marylin', 'Rexroth', 'more', 'straight', 'might', 'be', 'why', 'Clooney', 'Zeta-Jones', 'do', ""n't"", 'click.My', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'are', 'when', 'Miles', 'legal', 'opponents', 'conferences', 'court', 'can', 'hear', 'Groucho', 'voice', 'twisting', 'people', 'knots.Intolerable', 'Cruelty', 'entertaining', 'Joel', 'Ethan', 'Coen', 'have', 'set', 'bar', 'so', 'high', 'Blood', 'Simple', 'Fargo', 'O', 'Brother', 'Where', 'Art', 'Thou', 'Man', 'Who', 'Was', ""n't"", 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feeling', 'was', 'barely', 'worth', 'trouble']",Intolerable Cruelty

617225,A2QZX5RPU8BAGK,B00005JMET,Greg Hirst,"[5, 6]","Any film by brother team Joel and Ethan Coen is going to be eagerly awaited, and possibly hurt by the rabid expectations of their legions of fans, of which I am a member. Their highest profile, most mainstream movie to date,  Intolerable Cruelty was bound to test the loyalty of these fans as they take yet another step away from their avant garde (in case you've forgotten, these are the guys who did the classic Big Lebowski) comedy roots and into the mainstream. if the pre-film buzz wasn't evidence enough of this, Intolerable cruelty's writing and producing credits have the contributions of 2 other individuals. One of them is Matt Stone, one of the South Park guys. I admire the South Park Phenomenon but did not enjoy the film or the guys' other movie Orgazmo (before they made it big, Parker and Stone made Cannibal The Musical! a very funny movie, and better than their later projects.)Intolerable Cruelty is still a Coen movie, first and foremost, and a long way from any of the other film's I've just mentioned, including the Coens' own films. George Clooney, one of the most watchable actors in Hollywood, does legal and amorous battles with the lovely Catherine Zeta-Jones in this Coen-style romantic comedy. I won't bother much with the plot, since where the film really shines is in its usual array of offbeat characters and general zaniness.  Clooney essentially reprises his fast-talking swindler role O brother Where Art Though, but this time as a divorce attorney. His antics are supported well by the comedy performances of characters such as Wheezy Joe the assassin and Bernie Mac as the less-than-subtle private eye.Like most Coen movies, this one takes some getting used to. I recall my rather underwhelmed and unimpressed reaction to my first viewing of the Big Lebowski which has since become the sure-fire anecdote to a  day of grouchiness. There are a few big gag laughs, but the Coens primary strategy seems to be to just keep the chuckles coming. As true romance, the film doesn't really work, and its hard to care for any of these characters when there are so slimy, but if anyone can pull off a film with unlikable protagonists, its the Coens. Coen fans should give this one more a chance before deploring it as the inevitable Hollywood-ization of their revered filmmaking team, and it should be a wonderful introduction into the zany Coen world for mainstream audiences.",4,Another Coen film along their recent trend,1072656000,"12 29, 2003",2003,2403,"['film', 'brother', 'team', 'Joel', 'Ethan', 'Coen', 'going', 'be', 'eagerly', 'awaited', 'possibly', 'hurt', 'rabid', 'expectations', 'legions', 'fans', 'am', 'member', 'highest', 'profile', 'most', 'mainstream', 'movie', 'date', 'Intolerable', 'Cruelty', 'was', 'bound', 'test', 'loyalty', 'fans', 'take', 'yet', 'step', 'away', 'avant', 'garde', 'case', ""'ve"", 'forgotten', 'are', 'guys', 'who', 'did', 'classic', 'Big', 'Lebowski', 'comedy', 'roots', 'mainstream', 'pre-film', 'buzz', 'was', ""n't"", 'evidence', 'enough', 'Intolerable', 'cruelty', 'writing', 'producing', 'credits', 'have', 'contributions', '2', 'other', 'individuals', 'One', 'Matt', 'Stone', 'one', 'South', 'Park', 'guys', 'admire', 'South', 'Park', 'Phenomenon', 'did', 'not', 'enjoy', 'film', 'guys', 'other', 'movie', 'Orgazmo', 'made', 'big', 'Parker', 'Stone', 'made', 'Cannibal', 'Musical', 'very', 'funny', 'movie', 'better', 'later', 'projects', 'Intolerable', 'Cruelty', 'still', 'Coen', 'movie', 'first', 'foremost', 'long', 'way', 'other', 'film', ""'ve"", 'just', 'mentioned', 'including', 'Coens', 'own', 'films', 'George', 'Clooney', 'one', 'most', 'watchable', 'actors', 'Hollywood', 'legal', 'amorous', 'battles', 'lovely', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'Coen-style', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bother', 'much', 'plot', 'where', 'film', 'really', 'usual', 'array', 'offbeat', 'characters', 'general', 'zaniness', 'Clooney', 'essentially', 'fast-talking', 'swindler', 'role', 'O', 'brother', 'Where', 'Art', 'Though', 'time', 'divorce', 'attorney', 'antics', 'are', 'supported', 'well', 'comedy', 'performances', 'characters', 'such', 'Wheezy', 'Joe', 'assassin', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'less-than-subtle', 'private', 'eye.Like', 'most', 'Coen', 'movies', 'one', 'getting', 'used', 'recall', 'rather', 'underwhelmed', 'unimpressed', 'reaction', 'first', 'viewing', 'Big', 'Lebowski', 'become', 'sure-fire', 'anecdote', 'day', 'grouchiness', 'are', 'few', 'big', 'gag', 'Coens', 'primary', 'strategy', 'be', 'just', 'keep', 'chuckles', 'coming', 'true', 'romance', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'work', 'hard', 'care', 'characters', 'when', 'are', 'so', 'slimy', 'anyone', 'can', 'pull', 'off', 'film', 'unlikable', 'protagonists', 'Coens', 'Coen', 'fans', 'should', 'give', 'one', 'more', 'chance', 'deploring', 'inevitable', 'Hollywood-ization', 'revered', 'filmmaking', 'team', 'should', 'be', 'wonderful', 'introduction', 'zany', 'Coen', 'world', 'mainstream', 'audiences']",Intolerable Cruelty
617226,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,B00005JMET,Gregor von Kallahann,"[1, 1]","I kept waiting for INTOLERABLE CRUELTY to become a real Coen Brothers movie.  What it wound up coming closest to was a sort of Coen Brothers knock-off.  If I'd learned it was the work of Coen wannabes, it'd have made sense.  And as a star vehicle for George Clooney and Catherine Zeta-Jones, it's not bad.  And it has plenty of humorous bits.  (I'll be sure to think twice before next using my asthma inhaler).  Visually, it seems to be the least striking of the brothers efforts.  You couldn't be faulted for wondering if Roger Deakins, the Coens' regular cinematographer hadn't sat this one out.  But like his cohorts on the directorial end of things, he really WAS there--though maybe not fully invested in the project.As a screwball comedy, CRUELTY seems a much more conventional genre flick than, say, the earlier HUDSUCKER PROXY.  Its reputation as the Coens' most mainstream effort is pretty well deserved.  On the other hand, it's still quietly subversive.  If Clooney and Zeta-Jones drip star power throughout, it doesn't erase the fact that neither is particularly likeable.  But with stars of that magnitude, it actually may take a little while to realize that you really don't care for them as people.  They charm the audience just about as effectively as they charm everyone else in the movie AND each other.Like most screwball comedies, the movie ends happily (and this can't be a spoiler for anyone at this point, can it?)  Perhaps, I should say, happily enough.  Who knows what's in store for these two actually.  They may continue to scheme against each other for the rest of their godforaken lives. Old habits die hard, after all.  Still they look great together.  And deserve each other in every sense.Friends who are not quite as smitten with the Coen oeuvre as I am have commented on how much they actually LIKE this film.  That may be INTOLERABLE CRUELTY'S most subversive quality.  If it gets people to look anew at FARGO, LEBOWSKI, NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN and rest of the brothers' more ""difficult"" work, it will have done its (dirty)job well indeed.

617231,A3T8T6G9VNL0RJ,B00005JMET,Harrison Koehli,"[3, 10]","A comedy of Hollywood infidelity and monetarily inspired marital maneuverings, Intolerable Cruelty is probably the Coens' worst movie. It stars George Clooney and Catherine Zeta-Jones as a pair of shallow, greedy shells of human beings, Clooney a highly successful divorce lawyer, schooled in the practice of winning arguments by any means necessary, and Zeta-Jones a conniving, cold-hearted seductress out to catch, and then divorce, a rich husband for half his money. Both show a stunning facility to lie and manipulate. Naturally, they end up together, and while the film itself is unremarkable it does have something to say about the highly ponerized qualities of Western culture.Take this line from Clooney's character, Miles Massey, delivered to a cheating wife whose husband caught her in the act, and who, of course wants ""fair"" representation: ""Hmm... Hmm... Yes, your husband did show remarkable foresight in taking those pictures. And, yes, absent a swimming pool, the presence of a pool man would appear to be suspicious. But, Madam, who is the real victim here? Let me suggest to you the following. Your husband, who on a prior occasion had slapped you, beat you...""While the Coens humorously push this human tendency to create one's reality out of thin air throughout the movie, sometimes to a ridiculous degree, the line pretty much captures the modus operandi of the film's characters, and of the entire Western legal system. It also points out the main weakness of our culture as a whole, and the reason we won't last long. A culture without a popular understanding of psychopathy faces a very real danger from the very thing of which they are unaware, and a culture without a popular understanding of psychopathy and whose citizens demonstrate an almost inborn tendency to lie, to create personal fictions and to even come to believe those fictions, all to present themselves in a better light, is hurtling so fast towards self-destruction that is perhaps unavoidable at this point.There is a phrase to describe these fictions that people like Miles Massey are so adept at conjuring up out of thin air. They are called cover stories, plausible stories made to put the facts in a light completely at odds with the reality of a situation. The motivations are simple. In a legal system it goes as follows: how can I put my client, who is undoubtedly guilty, in a good enough light that the judge or jury will be convinced that they are innocent? How can I lie well enough to convince them that it is my opponent that is lying? How can I make my client's victim look like the guilty party? In other words, it's all about perception-management, creating a version of the ""truth"" that benefits the client, and playing with ""facts"" in such a way that the word loses all meaning.The notion of the cover story maps our reality so well that if we trace its roots we are led directly to the roots of the human condition, that murky territory plumbed with such insight by the best philosophers, mystics, novelists, and poets (I'd normally include the Coens in this category, but they lose points on this one). From the self-deceptions of everyday life to the ""big lies"" told by the scammers who call themselves leaders, most of our notions about life are often little more than cover stories to hide a truth we refuse to see, and often a reality that is too scary to imagine.And when a society develops the habit of twisting the truth, malicious abuse of the truth becomes easy and prevalent. Western culture is asphyxiated by it. Our thinking becomes increasingly pathological and downright wrong, making us vulnerable to those who take advantage of this face-saving tendency. In other words, when we lie to ourselves, we're easy prey for psychopaths who lie to us. We may identify with our nationality to the extent that we filter out negative thoughts about our leaders and our conduct with other countries. We may ignore the atrocities committed in our names. Even worse, we may take the bait offered by our leaders and substitute important data, reaching pseudo-logical and pseudo-moral opinions. ""They deserve it, because they hate us."" ""That massacre wasn't actually a massacre. They fired first after all, and we were only defending ourselves."" ""The guy had weapons of mass destruction."" ""They're the ones that want to kill us, we're just making sure they'll never get the chance.""We buy the cover story, hook, line, and sinker. On a cultural level, the process is called myth-making. We create grand histories, semi-mythical founders of nations, charter documents that sustain the false belief that we are something we are not. The process is described at length in several books. Burton Mack's latest,Myth and the Christian Nation: A Social Theory of Religion (Religion in Culture: Studies in Social Contest & Construction), is a good start and Shlomo Sand's bestsellerThe Invention of the Jewish People, is a great case study of these processes in action. It is by the cultural substitution of data that we come to see ourselves as a people at odds with another people. We twist the facts available to come to mistaken conclusions about who the real enemy of humanity is, and who is responsible for the propagation and manipulation of myths in the first place: psychopaths. Andrew Lobaczewski'sPolitical Ponerology (A Science on the Nature of Evil Adjusted for Political Purposes)is the book that puts it all together and offers the solutions.When we consider some facts that, taken separately, are relatively easy to believe, the situation becomes clearer. Psychopaths thrive in corporations and politics (witness Madoff and Blagojevich), and the violent ones are considered the worst of the worst criminals (most serial killers are psychopaths). And with unlimited black budgets, cannon fodder soldiers, crafty intelligence agencies with generations of experience in making murder look like an accident, political psychopaths, simply by virtue of the scope of their influence, are potentially the most dangerous. When you combine these facts with the existence of a public that has lost its ability to think, patently false cover stories find fertile ground in the whitewashed pastures of the Western mind, where truth is buried and artifice taken for authenticity.",2,Cover Stories and a Culture of Lies,1266105600,"02 14, 2010",2010,6284,"['comedy', 'Hollywood', 'infidelity', 'monetarily', 'inspired',

Semones ""soanim8ed""","[32, 33]","There is a point in Intolerable Cruelty where George Clooney is giving a key note speech professing his love that is long enough to make you suspect the Coen brothers have ""sold out"" into schmaltz.  Wrong!  The film, in typical Coen style, dives into as many twists and turns as is needed in a good thriller.  Fortunately, the film is a comedic farce.Clooney plays Miles Massey, the most prominent divorce lawyer in southern California.  A man so good at what he does he has a prenuptial contract named after him.  Massey's good and he knows it.  Near the beginning of the film, he and his assistant, Wrigley (Paul Adelstein), are chatting about how boring Massey's life has become while a sweating client sits between them as the client's wife describes how she was used as a sex slave.  Massey is that confident of himself.And confidence is what Clooney is all about.  He is simply incredible.  Swaggering around like a peacock while checking to make sure his teeth are clean, Clooney gives his best performance.  There is no denying his charm here.  Even when he's being a prig.Enter Marylin Rexroth (Catherine Zeta-Jones), a woman who's only goal is to marry a rich man, catch him in some indiscretion and divorce him for half of what he's worth.  She wants to be independent she claims.  Massey falls for her completely.  She is his match in game-playing and confidence and he must have her.Thus sets up the Coens' romantic comedy farce.  It's bizarre at times, but humorous throughout as one coincidental incident sets-up another and turns all the characters on both of their ears.

Being the Cohen Brothers fan that I am, I quickly suggested this, since I missed it when it was in the theater. I don't know if it was the dinner or the wine, but she quickly nodded off, leaving me to catch this one on my own. I was disappointed, especially since she really like 'Fargo' and 'Oh Brother Where Art Thou?'Make no mistake, from the opening credits with 'Suspicion Minds'  overlayed, to Billy Bob Thorton in a daytime drama, this is unmistakably Coen. It has that Big Lebowski feel, a light hearted story with deeper meaning. In this case, it's the lovely interplay between George Clooney and Catherine Zeta Jones. Clooney plays a high powered divorce lawyer, while Zeta Jones plays a socialite that jumps from man to man to increase her fortune. Obviously, their paths cross. Clooney is 'fascinated' by Zeta Jones, and they eventually hook up. This movie really deals with the question of whether love is more important than money, and the nature of conquest. It's difficult to justify this being a great movie without giving too much of the plot away, but it's really worth your hour and 40 minutes.

He specializes in getting his client everything that he (or she) wants no matter how much in the wrong the client actually is.  He is brilliant and is also the author of the Massey Prenup, which is an iron-clad pre-nuptial agreement that has never been penetrated.  From the beginning of the movie, we get to see Miles Massey work, getting off both men and women who have cheated on their spouses.  Massey can work the court room and find loopholes and is incredibly successful.  He is so successful that he is able to get off a man, Rex Rexroth, after he is caught on videotape cheating on his wife Marilyn (Catherine Zeta-Jones).This completely destroys Marilyn's way of life as she was in the marriage for the money and was trying to divorce him for the money that she would get.  During the divorce proceedings, Miles finds himself infatuated with Marilyn.  So much so that he takes risks to meet her and talk to her and hopefully to woo her.  Things don't go very smoothly (as far as Miles' dream relationship goes) and the more Miles tries to win Marilyn, the less likely it seems possible as she quickly finds a rich Texan named Howard Doyle (Billy Bob Thornton) to marry.This is not your typical Coen Brothers movie.  This is the most commercial film that they've done, but there is still plenty of the Coen's offbeat humor and darkness throughout the film.

Fans of the Coen Brothers will instantly love this fast paced, witty and surreal piece of cinematic genius, brilliantly directed, fantastically scripted and incredibly intelligent.  While the idea of Clooney and Zeta-Jones fogging up the screen in a romantic comedy turned me off so much that I missed this in the cinema, now I've seen it I can't believe I had so little faith in Joel and Ethan.  The Coen's didn't write the story, so this is sadly no Big Lebowski or Fargo, and some of the characters are a tad unsubtle (Cedric the Entertainer's private dick, the half-dead head lawyer and Clooney's sidekick come to mind) but they did have a hand in the screenplay, and therefore the dialogue sparkles with the typical Coen shine.  I think the best scene for this is during Zeta-Jones' first divorce, as Clooney, his sidekick and this Client, in strained whispers, discuss their experience with the Judge (""Have you sat before this Judge before?"",""No, the Judge sits first..."").  The cockpit scenes in Airport spring to mind...The plot wriggles and squirms, involves and discards without ever falling into the trap of becoming too slow, sentimental or boring and various recurring jokes and camera shots from other Coen brothers movies will keep the viewer entertained even after the6th or 7th run through.

Movieland's bad lads have largely ignored the Hollywood monster since their 1984 debut, Blood Simple, but this collaboration with Imagine Entertainment's Brian Grazer represent them looking fulsomely into the mouth of the beast. Their movies have spanned every genre, from farce to film noire, wrestling any number of sacred cows to the ground on their travels. Intolerable Cruelty is just another experiment - this time into the world of mainstream movies and the theme of love and divorce in our times.Miles Massey (George Clooney) is a slick, successful divorce lawyer to the rich and faithless. In between dental appointments to maintain his pearly bite, he manipulates the legal process to assist his philandering clients in wriggling out of their fiscal responsibilities - for a handsome fee of course. His latest client is the outrageously wealthy Rex Rexroth (Edward Herrmann) whose fetish for choo-choo trains extends rather further than just watching toys go 'round a little track. His wife Marylin (Catherine Zeta-Jones) has hired the hyperactive filming detective, Gus (Cedric the Entertainer) to catch his fleshy high jinks, and now, armed with the evidence, she plans to ""nail his ass"" (as Gus so flamboyantly describes it.) Her plan is elegantly simple - to sue Rex, play the damning tape as evidence in court, collect a phenomenal alimony, then quietly enjoy her luxurious independence. There's just one problem....Massey.Now, we know Massey must be a professional, because in spite of his obvious ardent attraction to the imminently ex Mrs Rexroth, he still manages a full scale victory for his locophilic client. With her original plans in tatters, poor Marylin has to lure another poor mogul into her web. Enter magnate Howard D. Doyle (Billy Bob Thornton). Having hoped that divorce proceedings would have cleared a path for his own intentions, Massey implores Marylin to enlist him as her attorney. She instead favours her previous lawyer (Six Feet Under's Richard Jenkins), although she does nothing to discourage Massey's romantic overtures.The paths of our two protagonists continue to cross and weave, leading inevitably to their ultimate entanglement. But, of course, nothing is as it seems, and their hidden agendas and duplicitous tactics threaten disaster for all concerned.So, does it work? Well, kind of - it rather depends on your expectation of a Coen film. Clooney virtually modernises his role of Everett in O Brother, Where Art Thou, with his foppish ways and glib verbosity. It appears he relishes the opportunity to display his range of physical comedy, his self-deprecating manner just barely keeping his performance from toppling completely into slapstick. As a duo, he and Zeta-Jones work very well together - their comic rhythms work in excellent syncopation, and their wit and intelligence match and complement each other. Zeta-Jones' portrayal of Marylin is well-pitched and honed. Her performance relies on more than a ""va-va-voom"" factor - it demonstrates a knowing intelligence and an almost feline hint of danger that keeps her multidimensional and interesting. The rapport between these two leads results in the delivery of some deliciously wicked dialogue, and there is more than one crackle of electricity between the pair.The storyline itself is a little variable, oscillating from standard commercial plotlines to sparks of Coenesque mayhem. These two opposing elements have a tendency to cancel each other out somewhat, which will probably leave those who loved such films as Down With Love, or How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days feeling rather disenfranchised, and Coen devotees feeling as if they've just been dipped in sugar and thrown to the thespians.And therein lies the major challenge with this film. It's liable to leave a commercial audience a little unsettled, and a Coen admirer a little unsatisfied. Perhaps we could describe it as a ""Coen film with trainer wheels"" - not the full flight package, but enough to get you started.The production levels are very high - everything is very glossy and glorious, and the support actors are all consummately wonderful.

Bernabo,"[6, 9]","It is important to remember that &quot;Intolerable Cruelty&quot; is a fable, which is the best way of explaining why tearing up a marital pre-nup actually works, whether or not you eat it with barbecue sauce.  This is a world where the only facts that can come out in court are those we do not know; everything else apparently gets forgotten, especially when it would be of some importance in a divorce case.  But this is the world of the Cohen Brothers and we learned a long time ago what that means.The story of this 2003 film is that divorce lawyer Miles Massey (George Clooney) is &quot;fascinated&quot; by Marylin Rexroth (Catherine Zeta-Jones).  But even being fascinated does not stop him from blowing her out of the water when she tries to divorce her husband Rex Rexroth (Edward Herrmann), nor does going back to the beginning stop her from her plan to marry and divorce a millionaire.  We know that he is good, because Marylin had a video showing Rex cheating on her and it did not do her any good, so the question is why she wants to hire him to draft the famous ironclad Massey Pre-Nup for her next marriage to Texas oil billionaire Howard D. Doyle (Billy Bob Thornton).  Why would a gold-digger like Marylin want a pre-nup?  Stay tuned.One thing you cannot accuse the Cohens of doing is repeating themselves when they make a comedy.  &quot;Intolerable Cruelty&quot; is not like &quot;Raising Arizona,&quot; &quot;Fargo,&quot; or &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot;, each of which is funny in its own peculiar way.  It is, in its own weird way, their version of a screwball comedy, except with a lot more bite than you usually get in such films.  The supporting cast has nice performances from Geoffrey Rush, Richard Jenkins, Julia Duffy, Jonathan Hadary, and Cedric the Entertainer, but in the end this film comes down to Clooney and Zeta-Jones, both of whom are actually required to do more than stand there and look good, although she has several scenes that require her to do just that while his eyes widen appreciatively.  Surprisingly these two actually have something in common: they are not sure they still want to be the people they have become and might actually do something about it.

With a cast to die for, it has all the makings of a terrific film. Unfortunately, that is about as far as it gets, as the cast cannot undo what has been done by a screenplay that is seriously flawed, due to its inability to decide what type of film it should be. Unfortunately, it looks as if the director could not make up his mind either, producing a film that is neither fish nor fowl.At first, I thought that it would be a screwball type of comedy, with George Clooney in the role that would have gone to Cary Grant in the golden age of filmmaking. Then, it seems to take another direction altogether, as if it were supposed to be a romantic comedy with a dark side or simply satire gone awry. Who knows? The Coen brothers surely don't. The film lacks a total surety of identity that kills it, despite the stellar cast. It is a flop, pure and simple.The plot line is a fairly basic one. It is about a slick, greedy and grasping, unscrupulous matrimonial attorney (George Clooney), the kind that gives all lawyers a bad name, and a greedy and grasping gold digging beauty (Catherine Zeta-Jones), who gives all beautiful women a bad name.

The film takes place in a slick, shiny and heartless Los Angeles. In the old thirties comedies, there was always an element of humorous class confrontation (and sympathy for losers) that gave the films an edge. There's not enough of that populist sympathy here. If we knew a little bit why Miles and Marilyn were so driven (Miles seems to have a father problem, but we never really learn anything about Marilyn) it could put their behavior into perspective.The inclusion of an African-American detective is interesting, but Miles (and the film) treat him dismissively. Miles meets him for lunch in a dingy diner instead of one of the glossier restaurants we see in the film. In the screwball genre, this should be the scene where we see the better, decent side of Miles; we should see that he is a man of the people. But in this film, the diner, usually a place of populist wisdom, (and a handy cinematic counterpoint to the empty values of the wealthy characters), is dismissed and ridiculed. If Miles had met the detective in an upscale restaurant (and taken Marilyn to the diner), that would have told us something about his inborn decency despite his privileged background. Then we would have really been on his side. And if we were given an inkling of why Marilyn is so money-hungry, we might have more sympathy for her. This film lacks the underlying empathy for ordinary people that the great comedies had beneath their slick facades. This empathy is in the other Coen Brothers films, so it's disappointing not to see it here.",3,Is Diner Food Really That Bad?,1089590400,"07 12, 2004",2004,1734,"['Miles', 'Massey', 'George', 'Clooney', 'ruthless', 'divorce', 'lawyer', 'Marilyn', 'Rexroth', 'Catherine', 'Zeta', 'Jones', 'equally', 'ruthless', 'gold-digging', 'wife', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'take', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'genre', 'film', 'place', 'slick', 'shiny', 'heartless', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'old', 'thirties', 'comedies', 'was', 'always', 'element', 'humorous', 'class', 'confrontation', 'sympathy', 'losers', 'gave', 'films', 'edge', 'not', 'enough', 'populist', 'sympathy', 'here', 'knew', 'little', 'bit', 'why', 'Miles', 'Marilyn', 'were', 'so', 'driven', 'Miles', 'have', 'father', 'problem', 'never', 'really', 'learn', 'anything', 'Marilyn', 'could', 'put', 'behavior', 'perspective.The', 'inclusion', 'African-American', 'detective', 'interesting', 'Miles', 'film', 'treat', 'dismissively', 'Miles', 'lunch', 'dingy', 'diner', 'instead', 'one', 'glossier', 'see', 'film', 'screwball', 'genre', 'should', 'be', 'scene', 'where', 'see', 'better', 'decent', 'side', 'Miles', 'should', 'see', 'man', 'people', 'film', 'diner', 'usually', 'place', 'populist', 'wisdom', 'handy', 'cinematic', 'counterpoint', 'empty', 'values', 'wealthy', 'characters', 'dismissed', 'ridiculed', 'Miles', 'had', 'met', 'detective', 'upscale', 'restaurant', 'taken', 'Marilyn', 'diner', 'would', 'have', 'told', 'something', 'inborn', 'decency', 'privileged', 'background', 'Then', 'would', 'have', 'really', 'been', 'side', 'were', 'given', 'inkling', 'why', 'Marilyn', 'so', 'money-hungry', 'might', 'have', 'more', 'sympathy', 'film', 'underlying', 'empathy', 'ordinary', 'people', 'great', 'comedies', 'had', 'beneath', 'slick', 'facades', 'empathy', 'other', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'films', 'disappointing', 'not', 'see', 'here']",Intolerable Cruelty

It is the nature of filmmaking. Sometimes the magic works, sometimes it doesn't.

He takes on Marilyn Rexroth [Catherine Zeta-Jones], who is divorcing her husband on the grounds of infidelity. She has the video tapes to prove it, but, unbelievably, Massey wins the case in court for the unfaithful husband. Marilyn is left with nothing, but Massey hasn't seen the last of her. She plots her revenge, which begins by making him fall in love with her.The problem is that ""Intolerable Cruelty"" doesn't involve the audience. Both Massey and Rexroth are unlikable characters, so why should we much care what they do or what happens to them? If the movie is a black comedy, where is the comeuppance the couple deserves?

It was all crazy and in a blur but all the actors give top notch performances, especially by Clooney, Cedric and Jones. This is written by Ethan and Joel Cohen but directed by Joel.

Right out of the gate with Blood Simple, they hit the ground running and since then have carved out a niche for themselves as perhaps America's finest filmmakers. They have a signature style that flows easily from one genre to the next, and in my book, they've never even come close to failing.Until this time. After seeing George Clooney's performance in O, Brother, Where Art Thou?, I was very excited to see him working with the Coens again. To his credit, Clooney is the sole standout in this film that makes attempts at reviving the spirit of some of the greater screwball comedies of the 30's &amp; 40's. Had this been set in those times and filmed in black and white, it would probably have been a much better movie. Catherine Zeta Jones brings her usual nothing to the film, which is hardly surprising.

617265,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B00005JMET,mirasreviews,"[0, 0]","Miles Massey (George Clooney) is a charming but unscrupulous Hollywood divorce lawyer famous for obtaining lucrative settlements for not-so-innocent clients and leaving his opponents poverty-stricken. One such opponent was Marilyn Rexroth (Catherine Zeta-Jones), the scheming wife of a childish but fabulously wealthy industrialist. Determined not to be beaten twice, Marilyn turns to Miles for legal assistance with her second marriage, and the two begin to find themselves irresistibly drawn to one another.&quot;Intolerable Cruelty&quot; is the Coen brothers' most mainstream fair yet. Officially, Joel directed, and Ethan produced, as usual. The brothers co-wrote the film with Robert Ramsey and Matthew Stone. &quot;Intolerable Cruelty&quot; lacks the black humor of most Coen brothers' comedies. Instead, it's a screwball comedy that tries to be clever. George Clooney is as charismatic as ever, even in the screwball routines. Catherine Zeta-Jones is lovely and seductive and has a nice wardrobe, but her character is a little flat. She is intended to be a match for Miles Massey's machinations, but we really don't see it. She seems more like a straightforward gold-digger than a clever comic femme fatale. And she never comes across as threatening in any way. More lines would have given her the opportunity to demonstrate her wit and convince us that Miles would really fall for this woman. The film has an all-star supporting cast, which is universally terrific. Billy Bob Thorton is irresistible as Marilyn's  incurably garrulous second husband. Jonathan Hadary is hilarious as the Baron Krauss Von Espy, a witness at Marilyn's divorce hearing. Other notable supporting contributions include: Geoffrey Rush as one Miles' defeated courtroom opponents, Cedric the Entertainer as a private investigator specializing in compromising videos, Julia Duffy as a filthy rich Beverly Hills divorcee, and Edward Herrmann as Marilyn's first husband. The problems with the film are that Marilyn seems underwritten and not especially clever, the jokes are a little tired, and the film has a few too many acts. So, in spite of its undeniably attractive stars and excellent supporting cast, &quot;Intolerable Cruelty&quot; just isn't very funny -with the notable exception of the Baron's courtroom appearance. It's not biting enough to be good satire. Nor is it successful in generating the lighthearted charm of early romantic comedies to which it seems to aspire.The DVD: Bonus features include a making-of documentary entitled &quot;A Look Inside Intolerable Cruelty&quot;, a featurette on the film's wardrobe by Costume Designer Mary Zophres, outtakes, written bios of the cast and filmmakers, and a DVD-ROM (Windows only). The making-of documentary contains interviews with the film's actors, the Coen brothers, and producer Brain Glazier. It's long, but it actually doesn't say much. &quot;The Wardrobe&quot; featurette is a nice addition for those interested in film fashion. Subtitles are available in French, Spanish, and English.

Should've known better from a Coen brothers' movie I suppose, because Intolerable Cruelty is actually a lot better than its reception at the box office would have you believe.  The story pits man-eater Catherine Zeta Jones alongside George Clooney, the lawyer who on behalf of her husband, ensured she got nothing from her last divorce settlement.Clooney is perfect for this kind of role, clearly relishing the opportunity to play the egotistical poser with a hidden soul, delivering lines such as 'That woman fascinates me' with the kind of personality that only he can deliver.  I've never been a fan of Catherine Zeta Jones, but she really sparkles here, particularly with the verbal put-downs and snappy dialogue.Of course, this being a Coen brothers' film there are a few manic characters along the sidelines, most noticeably Wheezy the assassin, the crazy old man who runs the law firm and most hilariously, Billy Bob Thornton as the second husband.  He alone is worth the admission.  Whilst it seems all too easy to state that this isn't as good as previous Coens' movies such Fargo or The Big Lewbowski, it's still a whole lot better than the majority of romantic fluff out there.  Indeed, even if some of the Coens' crazier elements don't really come off for such a clearly mainstream affair, it's still a very enjoyable ride, and there are a few good laugh-out-loud moments.

The acting by Clooney and Zeta-Jones is top-notch, and they were cast perfectly for their roles. There is a colorful cast of supporting characters. The film only made me laugh out loud once in a while, but almost every scene is fun since the movie doesn't take itself seriously. The plot is full of unpredictable twists, keeping things lively. The writing is excellent, with many clever lines. By the end I was truly jumping out of my seat, raving about how great a movie it is.If you don't believe me, here's a quote from professional film reviewer James Berardinelli (reelviews.net):[...] for those who like intelligent, quirky movies filled with big laughs, dry wit, and other small pleasures, it's difficult to beat Joel and Ethan Coen's humorous outings. Intolerable Cruelty is the most recent of these - a film that takes the traditional romantic comedy and tweaks it by way of The War of the Roses.

Johnson,"[0, 1]","The Coen brothers prove they can turn in a crowd-pleasing genre movie that's not a film noir (though it gently hints and pushes just enough in those - and many other - directions to remind you how much darker they could have twisted given another mood). Still retaining enough trademark wicked humour at the expense of its unknowing characters (specifically the marital losers played by Ed Begley Jr, Geoffrey Rush and a very game Billy Bob Thornton) to keep you reminded of their sibling brand, the flm nevertheless also proves thoroughly irresistable by most (low) mainstream expeectations. As rom-coms go, this is deliberately Cary Grant territory, with the Coens deliberately ignoring the Nora Ephron and Richard Curtis sensibilities that have predominantly twin-streamed through romantic comedies since When Harry Met Sally and Four Weddings and a Funeral. Rather, whilst directly enticing this mainstream used to the tiring Ephron menu, the always appealing Curtis fare and the increasingly less sharp Woody Allen outputs, the Coens bravely dare to offer us a taste of something a little rarer, a little more exotic and a little more mischievous - a high-end sophisticated rom-com driven alernatively by challenging combinations of high and low wit, sparkling dialogue and  outright venom. The result is an aristocratic Hollywood concoction, with Clooney particularly on top form - once again proving his particular brand of guy charisma irresistably infectious. Intolerable Cruelty is to the mostly forgotten Golden Age of Hollywood rom-coms what Kill Bill is to the action movies of the 70s - stirring happy hints and reminders less of specific movies you can name than broad cinematic moods and pleasures you once treasured.

Zeta-Jones, in particular, has the kind of classic beauty that puts her right up there with the great screen legends of all time, women like Ingrid Bergman, Natalie Wood and Audrey Hepburn, who, with their ravishing good looks and photogenic quality, came to define the ideal of female pulchritude in their time.Credit the Coen Brothers, who made ""Intolerable Cruelty,"" with having the good sense to know what they had in these two stars and for exploiting it to the full.  They have allowed the actors to play off their good looks, most especially Ms. Zeta-Jones, portraying an icy gold-digger who specializes in marrying rich men with the express purpose of taking them for everything they've got once the marriage is ended.  Clooney is the first-rate divorce lawyer who finally meets his match when he falls under the spell of this strangely bewitching woman.The major joy in ""Intolerable Cruelty"" comes from watching these two tremendously attractive stars go at one another - be it in lust, passion or anger.  Miles and Marylin are both seasoned game-players and world-class manipulators who know how to get the better of the hapless victims who stumble headlong into their paths.  Unfortunately, the film itself never lives up to its promise of becoming a slashing satire on the mores of our divorce-happy society.  The main reason for this is that the script often shoots too low in its tone, opting for an overly broad, slapstick approach when a slyer, subtler style is what's really called for.  It's not that ""Intolerable Cruelty"" doesn't provide its fair share of laughs; it's just that we feel there should be a whole lot more of them given the pedigree of the film's makers and the high-powered acting of its amazingly gifted cast.In addition to Clooney and Zeta-Jones - who hit all the right notes in their playing off one another - the lineup also includes Geoffrey Rush, Billy Bob Thornton, Edward Herrmann, Richard Jenkins and Cedric the Entertainer, who steals the few scenes he's in with his manic interpretation of a private investigator who specializes in capturing wayward spouses in compromising positions.Perhaps, ""Intolerable Cruelty,"" for all its moments of mirth and fun, simply doesn't go far enough into the realm of outrageousness to make the concept really work.  The Coen Brothers, who have proven themselves masters of the absurd in the past, for some reason seem to be holding back in this film, going for the easy laugh and the easy sentiment when what we really want is for them to cut loose and go for the jugular (as Danny De Vito did with similar material in ""The War of the Roses"" so many years ago).  Maybe Miles and Marylin need to be a little more nasty, a trifle more cutthroat in their demeanor to bring it all to life.""Intolerable Cruelty"" offers some hearty chuckles and some definite eye-candy in the person of Ms. Zeta-Jones, but, when all is said and done, the film is mainly just promises and not enough delivery.",3,uneven film with a most beautiful woman,1067040000,"10 25, 2003",2003,3088,"['doubt', 'are', 'two', 'more', 'strikingly', 'attractive', 'actors', 'movies', 'today', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'Zeta-Jones', 'particular', 'kind', 'classic', 'beauty', 'right', 'there', 'great', 'screen', 'legends', 'time', 'women', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'who', 'ravishing', 'good', 'looks', 'photogenic', 'quality', 'came', 'define', 'ideal', 'female', 'pulchritude', 'time.Credit', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'who', 'made', 'Intolerable', 'Cruelty', 'having', 'good', 'sense', 'know', 'what', 'had', 'two', 'stars', 'exploiting', 'full', 'have', 'allowed', 'actors', 'play', 'off', 'good', 'looks', 'most', 'especially', 'Ms.', 'Zeta-Jones', 'portraying', 'icy', 'gold-digger', 'who', 'marrying', 'rich', 'men', 'express', 'purpose', 'taking', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'got', 'once', 'marriage', 'ended', 'Clooney', 'first-rate', 'divorce', 'lawyer', 'who', 'finally', 'match', 'when', 'spell', 'strangely', 'bewitching', 'woman.The', 'major', 'joy', 'Intolerable', 'Cruelty', 'watching', 'two', 'tremendously', 'attractive', 'stars', 'go', 'one', 'be', 'lust', 'passion', 'anger', 'Miles', 'Marylin', 'are', 'seasoned', 'game-players', 'world-class', 'manipulators', 'who', 'know', 'how', 'get', 'better', 'hapless', 'victims', 'who', 'stumble', 'headlong', 'paths', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'never', 'up', 'promise', 'becoming', 'slashing', 'satire', 'mores', 'divorce-happy', 'society', 'main', 'reason', 'script', 'often', 'too', 'low', 'tone', 'opting', 'overly', 'broad', 'slapstick', 'approach', 'when', 'slyer', 'subtler', 'style', 'what', 'really', 'called', 'not', 'Intolerable', 'Cruelty', ""n't"", 'provide', 'fair', 'share', 'laughs', 'just', 'feel', 'should', 'be', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'given', 'pedigree', 'film', 'makers', 'high-powered', 'acting', 'amazingly', 'gifted', 'cast.In', 'addition', 'Clooney', 'Zeta-Jones', 'who', 'hit', 'right', 'notes', 'playing', 'off', 'one', 'lineup', 'also', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'Edward', 'Herrmann', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'who', 'few', 'scenes', 'manic', 'interpretation', 'private', 'investigator', 'who', 'capturing', 'wayward', 'spouses', 'compromising', 'positions.Perhaps', 'Intolerable', 'Cruelty', 'moments', 'mirth', 'fun', 'simply', ""n't"", 'go', 'far', 'enough', 'realm', 'outrageousness', 'make', 'concept', 'really', 'work', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'who', 'have', 'proven', 'masters', 'absurd', 'past', 'reason', 'seem', 'be', 'holding', 'back', 'film', 'going', 'easy', 'laugh', 'easy', 'sentiment', 'when', 'what', 'really', 'want', 'cut', 'loose', 'go', 'jugular', 'Danny', 'De', 'Vito', 'did', 'similar', 'material', 'War', 'Roses', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'Miles', 'Marylin', 'need', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'nasty', 'trifle', 'more', 'cutthroat', 'demeanor', 'bring', 'life', 'Intolerable', 'Cruelty', 'hearty', 'chuckles', 'definite', 'eye-candy', 'person', 'Ms.', 'Zeta-Jones', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'film', 'mainly', 'just', 'promises', 'not', 'enough', 'delivery']",Intolerable Cruelty
617276,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B00005JMET,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[1, 2]","George Clooney is Miles Massey, a divorce law king who may have met his match.  Catherine Zeta Jones is Marylin - the queen of gold-digging divorcees (who marries so often, it's pointless to giver her last name).  Naturally, their respective professions guarantee that they'll cross paths and, given that this is a movie, they're bound to fall in love.  Except that this is also a Coen brothers movie (""Fargo"", ""Blood Simple"", ""Oh Bother"", ""Raising Arizona""), which means that we're not sure exactly what's on their minds.  Being great judges of character, each can spot the other from miles away - but something causes each to lower his/her guard for the other.  Is it love?  And since this is a Coen brothers movie, what schemes will they cook up against each other before they grow up and honestly fall for each other (or simply fall about each other).  Massey is an ace at the warfare of divorce law - which he proves phenomenonly well in the first half hour (despite solid proof of adultery, he manages to win all for the wife of a soap-opera producer played by Geoffrey Rush; he has crafted the perfect, impenenetrable pre-nuptial agreement) and though he wins an early battle against Marilyn, we begin to wonder if perhaphs he has bitten off way too much than he can chew.""Intolerable"" is fun, but it's not the breathless fun of other Coen comedies like ""Brother"" or ""Hudsucker Proxy"" with its fast moving dialog and endless visual gags.  For a change, the Coens don't lard their story with hysterically off-balance supporting characters (like John Goodman or Charles Durning), and little of the plot goes to throwing us off balance with the intricate plotting of its stars. Unfortunately, the twists and turns seem less ironic than simply confusing (they love each other, they must conquer each other, they must destroy each other, but they can't live without each other).  The movie sets us up not to be surprised by the turns of its characters - Clooney starts off chipper but obviously dissatisfied with his life, and almost immediately smitten with Zeta-Jones; Marilyn only wants financial independence and freedom, but there are women who got that without having to choose it over love, and it's not long before she begins to wonder over whether there's more to happiness than a Porsche.  Worse, in spots, the film hints at the sort of mad-cap fun that the Coen brothers are known for.  There are some extra characters who do seem off-center, but they appear only briefly rather than ride the length of the flick, notably ""Cedric the Entertainer"" as a private investigator who works for anybody wanting to uncover any piece of evidence of infidelity (""nail his ass"" - that's his motto) but he disappears too soon, as if the flick couldn't come up with some way to tap into his energy.  There's also Billy Bob Thornton who appears to be a fast-talking scion of Texas oil money, the kind of character a Coen flick should be chok-filled with - but since ""Intolerable"" has few surprises, it can't keep your mind busy enough to forget that he might be one of Marilyn's weapons of destruction.  There's also Edward Herrman as Marilyn's first domestic victim (at least the first one in this movie).  His big problem isn't so much infidelity (though that is a problem) as much as a preoccupation with trains.  It's during his trial that the flick tosses some of the madcap jokes (a bout of fast wordplay between Clooney and a fellow lawyer with Herrman between them; a flamboyant concierge with some dirt on Zeta-Jones and Herrman) that may remind Coen fans of other movies.  It's only another sign that ""Intolerable"" is actually a conventional romantic comedy that tries to be a Coen brothers movie, but doesn't quite pull it off.  In short, if you're up for amovie, go for it.

617279,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B00005JMET,Samuel McKewon,"[11, 14]","""Intolerable Cruelty"" might be the first Coen Brothers film uncomfortable its own skin. Oh, it has the usual collection of inspired sequences mixed with an equal portion of needless ones - which could be said any Joel and Ethan C film not named ""Fargo."" What's surprising is how many styles the film tries - straight romance, black comedy, full-blown madcap - without finding one that suits it. George Clooney and Catherine Zeta-Jones both look great, and they certainly look like they'd be great together in something. But not this movie.Clooney is Miles Massey, an iceman divorce attorney that turns sure losers inside out by - well let's say his skill is more or less assumed and undefined. Zeta-Jones, with a movie star look that makes most Hollywood glamour girls look like coquettes, is gold digger Marilyn Rexroth, whose second husband (Edward Herrmann) is caught in a hotel room  (literally) doing the choo-choo dance with his mistress by video camera-toting PI (Cedric The Entertainer, drilling his one funny note into the Earth).It's a worthy case for Miles, who's grown tired of making deals. Then he sees Marilyn slink into the negotiating room, and, in the one thing we can believe about ""Intolerable Cruelty,"" falls hard for her. Miles and Marilyn will duel once, then twice, then a third and a fourth time in a movie that quietly aspires to the cruel, violent theatrics of ""The War of the Roses"" without taking the same mean risks. Unlike that wicked Danny DeVito film, which freely peddled to its audience a lusty hatred for the characters, the Coens feel the need to straddle us. The remainder of the film is filled with their quirky bit characters (the hitman and the ""senior partner"" are pretty hilarious) and what passes for chemistry between the leads.Zeta-Jones is luminous. But her bored, distracted performance is nearly an insult for a plot that requires a certain amount of pep - her level, composed gaze is fetching for about half the movie, but then we'd like her to have a pulse. Clooney plays the ham as if to do the work for both of them, gawking and mugging and flopping around like a fool. Coupled with performances in ""Solaris"" and ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind,"" Clooney almost seems to trying to work against his movie star looks and delivery.  The bright spot is Billy Bob Thornton in a cameo as one of Marilyn's husbands, a petroleum heir that used to play a little tight end at Texas A&M.; His presence is short-lived.The Coens usually deliver a dash of visual flair; that's missing in ""Intolerable Cruelty,"" unless Zeta-Jones counts as scenery. So is their nose for consistent, flashy verbal gymnastics, as at least three long bits - an opening sequence with Geoffrey Rush as a TV producer, a ridiculous ""Who's On First?"" riff in the courtroom, and a speech delivered by Miles at a Las Vegas seminar - whiff entirely. And Clooney nerdy sidekick, played by Paul Adelstein, could be the most poorly conceived character the brothers have ever created.Much was made of the Coens' partnership with producer Brian Grazer on this film in an effort, like Woody Allen with Dreamworks, to make a ""commercial"" - read: moneymaking - picture. Outside of ""O Brother, Where Art Thou,"" which had a cultlike following because of its bluegrass soundtrack, none of the Coen films - not even ""Fargo,"" now widely considered one of the best films ever made, - hit the bank in their first runs. ""Intolerable Cruelty"" is no more mainstream, really - in some ways, it's the antithesis of what audiences crave - it just has a better marketing campaign. If the final gross helps finance another great Coen film, so be it; otherwise, it's a shiny suit the brothers didn't need.",3,"Still clever, but so uneven, the sparks never quite fly",1066089600,"10 14, 2003",2003,3692,"['Intolerable', 'Cruelty', 'might', 'be', 'first', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'film', 'uncomfortable', 'own', 'skin', 'Oh', 'usual', 'collection', 'inspired', 'sequences', 'mixed', 'equal', 'portion', 'needless', 'ones', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'Joel', 'Ethan', 'C', 'film', 'not', 'named', 'Fargo', 'What', 'surprising', 'how', 'many', 'film', 'straight', 'romance', 'black', 'comedy', 'full-blown', 'madcap', 'finding', 'one', 'suits', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'look', 'great', 'certainly', 'look', ""'d"", 'be', 'great', 'together', 'something', 'not', 'movie.Clooney', 'Miles', 'Massey', 'iceman', 'divorce', 'attorney', 'sure', 'losers', 'well', 'let', 'say', 'skill', 'more', 'less', 'assumed', 'undefined', 'Zeta-Jones', 'movie', 'star', 'look', 'most', 'Hollywood', 'glamour', 'girls', 'look', 'coquettes', 'gold', 'digger', 'Marilyn', 'Rexroth', 'second', 'husband', 'Edward', 'Herrmann', 'caught', 'hotel', 'room', 'literally', 'doing', 'choo-choo', 'dance', 'mistress', 'video', 'camera-toting', 'PI', 'Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'drilling', 'one', 'funny', 'note', 'Earth', '.It', 'worthy', 'case', 'Miles', 'who', 'grown', 'tired', 'making', 'deals', 'Then', 'Marilyn', 'slink', 'negotiating', 'room', 'one', 'thing', 'can', 'believe', 'Intolerable', 'Cruelty', 'hard', 'Miles', 'Marilyn', 'will', 'duel', 'once', 'then', 'twice', 'then', 'third', 'fourth', 'time', 'movie', 'quietly', 'cruel', 'violent', 'theatrics', 'War', 'Roses', 'taking', 'same', 'mean', 'risks', 'wicked', 'Danny', 'DeVito', 'film', 'freely', 'peddled', 'audience', 'lusty', 'hatred', 'characters', 'Coens', 'feel', 'need', 'straddle', 'remainder', 'film', 'filled', 'quirky', 'bit', 'characters', 'hitman', 'senior', 'partner', 'are', 'pretty', 'hilarious', 'what', 'chemistry', 'leads.Zeta-Jones', 'luminous', 'bored', 'distracted', 'performance', 'nearly', 'insult', 'plot', 'certain', 'amount', 'pep', 'level', 'composed', 'gaze', 'fetching', 'movie', 'then', ""'d"", 'like', 'have', 'pulse', 'Clooney', 'ham', 'do', 'work', 'gawking', 'mugging', 'flopping', 'around', 'fool', 'Coupled', 'performances', 'Solaris', 'Confessions', 'Dangerous', 'Mind', 'Clooney', 'almost', 'trying', 'work', 'movie', 'star', 'looks', 'delivery', 'bright', 'spot', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'cameo', 'one', 'Marilyn', 'husbands', 'petroleum', 'heir', 'used', 'play', 'little', 'tight', 'end', 'Texas', 'A', 'M', 'presence', 'short-lived.The', 'Coens', 'usually', 'dash', 'visual', 'flair', 'missing', 'Intolerable', 'Cruelty', 'Zeta-Jones', 'counts', 'scenery', 'nose', 'consistent', 'flashy', 'verbal', 'gymnastics', 'least', 'three', 'long', 'bits', 'opening', 'sequence', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'TV', 'producer', 'ridiculous', 'Who', 'First', 'riff', 'courtroom', 'speech', 'delivered', 'Miles', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'seminar', 'whiff', 'entirely', 'Clooney', 'nerdy', 'sidekick', 'played', 'Paul', 'Adelstein', 'could', 'be', 'most', 'poorly', 'conceived', 'character', 'brothers', 'have', 'ever', 'created.Much', 'was', 'made', 'Coens', 'partnership', 'producer', 'Brian', 'Grazer', 'film', 'effort', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Dreamworks', 'make', 'commercial', 'read', 'moneymaking', 'picture', 'O', 'Brother', 'Where', 'Art', 'Thou', 'had', 'cultlike', 'following', 'bluegrass', 'soundtrack', 'none', 'Coen', 'films', 'not', 'even', 'Fargo', 'now', 'widely', 'considered', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'hit', 'bank', 'first', 'runs', 'Intolerable', 'Cruelty', 'more', 'mainstream', 'really', 'ways', 'antithesis', 'what', 'audiences', 'crave', 'just', 'better', 'marketing', 'campaign', 'final', 'gross', 'helps', 'finance', 'great', 'Coen', 'film', 'so', 'be', 'otherwise', 'shiny', 'suit', 'brothers', 'did', ""n't"", 'need']",Intolerable Cruelty

As is usual in their films, all the humour here is pretty dark, and it is the actors, and not the script, that really pull this film above mediocrity in the romanctic comedy genre.George Clooney continues to amaze me, because he is such a good, quirky actor, that truly embraces every ounce of cheesiness that comes with each of the character that he plays. He is the closest we have now to one of the classic actors of the 40's and 50's. He has the same style and swagger as a Bogart or Gable. Catherine Zeta-Jones is also very good here, showing that her performance in &quot;Chicago&quot; was no fluke. She is a solid actress, and she makes the most of her evil character, the often divorced woman who is seeking a huge settlement from all of her husbands. Also exceptional in this film are the smaller roles of Billy Bob Thorton and Geoffrey Rush, who each play their parts like they are having a great time with them, living up the eccentricities to delightful extremes.The plot here is nothing original, following the same pattern as the standard romantic comedy. Cloonet meets Zeta-Jones, and like the rest of the world, thinks she is beautiful, therefore falling for her. He is the divorce attourney representing one of her husbands, so they begin as enemies before eventually wanting to be together, as it goes.

I've never seen my wife laugh as hard as she did while watching this.Many a reviewer has already covered the theme. To rehash briefly, Clooney is a divorce attorney with absolutely no scruples. Zeta Jones is a gold digger. Lots can be done with those characters and the Coen brothers do a masterful job. There was a touch of &quot;Raising Arizona&quot; when two lead characters look at each other and scream &quot;AHHHHHHHHH&quot; in astonishment. And the dogs chasing, among others, the character played by Cedric the Entertainer.Be prepared to laugh, and laugh hard. Some of the film is pretty slapstick. But that's all right. If it's done okay, let it be.There's a little black comedy in that many of the characters are not exactly the height of human capacity.The only thing I have against the CD is that they have the usual, &quot;About...&quot; the film section with a few outtakes and whatnot. It's a letdown only in that I'm getting tired of spending money on a CD, then finding it promotes itself as much as just enjoying the show. I'm told that I'll have to get used to that. But I'm more inclined, frankly, to avoid purchases of CDs for that reason. I want to see a film I enjoy, not have a half hour of the actors telling the viewer how great they are, the great chemistry they had among each other and with the director. I can do without the hype.Aside from that, again, it's a funny flick.

617298,A1QZGBMUGA2HVL,B00005JMET,Tom Aiken,"[4, 4]","I saw a test screening of ""Intolerable Cruelty"" last Spring and am impatiently awaiting the opportunity to see it again. For many years I've been a devotee of the Coen brothers' work and this is a welcome addition to their filmography. ""Intolerable Cruelty"" has elements which remind me of many of their previous films. This despite the fact that ""Intolerable Cruelty"" is the first production for which they did not write the screenplay. I don't blame them for this, its a fantastic script. The dialogue immediately struck me as having the extra wit, style, and layeres of subtlety common to Big Lebowski, and O Brother Where Art Thou?The Los Angeles setting and eclectic characters is reminiscent of Lebowski. However, Clooney's character, a prominent divorce attorney spews gab like Ulysses Everitt McGill, only with better credentials. Intolerable Cruelty, despite its title, is also much lighter than anything else by the Coens- except perhaps Hudsucker Proxy. Lighthearted even with much of the storyline devoted to social climbing wives and fidelity-impaired husbands.The entire cast gives wonderful performances. Catherine Zeta-Jones has regained her title as sexiest woman in my world after her femme-fatale performance here. Clooney is perfect for his fast-talking part. Billy Bob, Geoffrey Rush, and Cedric the Entertainer all have memorable minor parts. Paul Adelstein is great as Clooney's understudy sidekick.Intolerable Cruelty is not perhaps a troubling, deep cinematic masterpiece on the order of Miller's Crossing or Fargo. But it is a fantastic comedy with many instantly quotable lines (""You fascinate me"") and subtely worth repeated viewings. With its big name cast this film is likely to once again return the Coen brothers to mainstream prominence.

Despite his impressive client list, a formidable win record, the respect of his peers and an ironclad contract the Massey pre-nup named after him, he's reached a crossroads in his life. Sated on success, boredom has set in and he's looking for new challenges. All that changes when Miles meets his match in the devastating Marylin Rexroth. Marylin is the soon-to-be ex-wife of his client Rex Rexroth, a wealthy real estate developer and habitual philanderer. With the help of hard charging private investigator Gus Petch, she has Rex nailed and is looking forward to the financial independence a successful divorce will bring. But thanks to Miles' considerable skills, she ends up with nothing. Not to be outdone, Marylin schemes to get even and as part of her plan, quickly marries oil tycoon Howard Doyle. Miles and his unflappable associate, Wrigley, unwittingly dig themselves in deeper and deeper as they go head-to-head with Marylin. Underhanded tactics, deceptions and an undeniable attraction escalate as Marylin and Miles square off in this classic battle of the sexes.

In short, the Coens are pulling punches when they shouldn't, relying on the &quot;stars&quot; of the film, and instead they give us nothing but a shallow imitation of the 40s screwball comedy.George Clooney plays the hero of the romantic comedy, the divorce lawyer who fell for Catherine Zeta-Jones's character who takes advantage of now (in)famous pre-naptial agreements to get more money.  And of course, they fight each other at first, in and out of the court, and then fall in love perhaps, but that obligatory process is no problem if these two stars have the same kind of sweet, natural charm as Cary Grant.But sorry, I see none here, and George Clooney is the same old Clooney speaking with the lopsided head; and Ms. Zeta-Jones is no fun, who leaves nothing but an impression that after all she cannot act, literally equating the watching experience of her with the idea &quot;Intolerable Cruelty.&quot;The greatest mistake is that the film refuses to question or make fun of these &quot;pre-naps.&quot;  By doing so, the men and women here (especially the latter) start to look unnaturally greedy.  And after all, when it's about rich people trying to deceive each other, why should we care?  We cannot relate to the characters who should be more charming and more human.  They are preoccupied with these pre-nap contracts which sound to many of us as remote as the big swimming pool depicted in this film, which makes the whole story ridiculous.OK, I know the silly story is there to entertain us, and good supports remind us of that, including Billy Bob Thornton, Richard Jenkins, and most of all the great Geoffrey Rush who shows us how to act in this comedy, always funny with measured comic acting even in the brief screen time given to him.  I wish the two leads had learned something from him, but as it is....If you want to see screwball comedy, see classic ones like &quot;His Girl Friday,&quot; or any one in the 40s, not this shallow one.",2,As Shallow and Empty as Reading Someone's Pre-Nap Agreement,1082937600,"04 26, 2004",2004,2125,"['Coen', 'Brothers', 'again', 'were', 'not', 'names', 'put', 'DVD', 'would', 'not', 'find', 'quot', 'Intolerable', 'Cruelty', 'quot', 'good', 'many', 'critics', 'actually', 'did', 'short', 'Coens', 'are', 'pulling', 'punches', 'when', 'should', ""n't"", 'relying', 'quot', 'stars', 'quot', 'film', 'instead', 'give', 'nothing', 'shallow', 'imitation', '40s', 'screwball', 'comedy.George', 'Clooney', 'hero', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'divorce', 'lawyer', 'who', 'fell', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'character', 'who', 'advantage', 'now', 'famous', 'pre-naptial', 'agreements', 'get', 'more', 'money', 'course', 'fight', 'other', 'first', 'court', 'then', 'fall', 'love', 'perhaps', 'obligatory', 'process', 'problem', 'two', 'stars', 'have', 'same', 'kind', 'sweet', 'natural', 'charm', 'Cary', 'Grant.But', 'sorry', 'see', 'none', 'here', 'George', 'Clooney', 'same', 'old', 'Clooney', 'speaking', 'lopsided', 'head', 'Ms.', 'Zeta-Jones', 'fun', 'who', 'nothing', 'impression', 'can', 'not', 'act', 'literally', 'equating', 'watching', 'experience', 'idea', 'quot', 'Intolerable', 'Cruelty.', 'quot', 'greatest', 'mistake', 'film', 'question', 'make', 'fun', 'quot', 'pre-naps.', 'quot', 'doing', 'so', 'men', 'women', 'here', 'especially', 'latter', 'start', 'look', 'unnaturally', 'greedy', 'when', 'rich', 'people', 'trying', 'deceive', 'other', 'why', 'should', 'care', 'can', 'not', 'relate', 'characters', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'charming', 'more', 'human', 'are', 'preoccupied', 'pre-nap', 'contracts', 'sound', 'many', 'as', 'remote', 'big', 'swimming', 'pool', 'depicted', 'film', 'whole', 'story', 'ridiculous.OK', 'know', 'silly', 'story', 'there', 'entertain', 'good', 'supports', 'remind', 'including', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'most', 'great', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'who', 'how', 'act', 'comedy', 'always', 'funny', 'measured', 'comic', 'acting', 'even', 'brief', 'screen', 'time', 'given', 'wish', 'two', 'leads', 'had', 'learned', 'something', '.If', 'want', 'see', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'see', 'classic', 'ones', 'quot', 'Girl', 'Friday', 'quot', 'one', '40s', 'not', 'shallow', 'one']",Intolerable Cruelty
617303,AVGGEAI1YGSAP,B00005JMET,Tucker Andersen,"[2, 3]","This is a very stylish movie, and incorporates many of the techniques that the Coen Brothers have used to advantage in their other films.  However, while the utilization of such techniques as overstatement carried to the point of absurdity and characters who incorporate terminal weirdness were essential to the success of those films, they are taken to an extreme here which provides many truly comedic moments but actually detracts from the overall impact of the film. This story doesn't have to be extremely outrageous to be funny; after all, the media constantly bombards us with the crazy situations that evolve where infidelity and divorce are concerned and the extremes to which divorce lawyers will go supposedly in the interests of their clients.George Clooney is Miles Massey, the media anointed star divorce lawyer continually burnishing his image in every way imaginable. Catherine Zeta Jones is Marylin Rexroth, whose sleuth catches her rich husband Rex Rexroth (Edward Hermann) in an act of marital infidelity and determines that her divorce settlement will be the path to riches and independence. When Miles succeeds in depriving her of the expected windfall in a hilarious courtroom scene, it is clear that will not be the end of their story. After all, he is getting bored with the repetitiveness of success and is looking for new challenges, while she is still searching for the path to a life of luxury. As the story proceeds, it is unclear until the end who is really being entrapped, whether it is primarily a game of one upmanship between the two of them, and how much of the stakes are financial and how much emotional. There is a wonderful supporting cast of great character actors including among others Geoffrey Rush, Cedric the Entertainer and Billy Bob Thornton in a fantastic role as Marylin's new love interest (Or is he?).George Clooney's work is always enjoyable and Catherine Zeta Jones is easy to watch; in addition the performances of the remainder of the cast complemented the stars and provided some truly funny moments. However, as a totality the film was somewhat disappointing. As I indicated earlier, the basic story had enough clever elements and comedic potential so that it could have been told without the Coen Brothers penchant for the bizarre and the extreme (which was clearly essential to the success of RAISING ARIZONA, FARGO, and O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU). So this rating is a compromise, four plus for the actors and storyline, two plus for the onscreen implementation of the basic idea.Tucker Andersen",3,(3+)  Tolerable Entertainment -But Not Up To Its Potential,1067817600,"11 3, 2003",2003,2554,"['very', 'stylish', 'movie', 'many', 'techniques', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'have', 'used', 'advantage', 'other', 'films', 'However', 'utilization', 'such', 'techniques', 'overstatement', 'carried', 'point', 'absurdity', 'characters', 'who', 'incorporate', 'terminal', 'weirdness', 'were', 'essential', 'success', 'films', 'are', 'taken', 'extreme', 'here', 'many', 'truly', 'comedic', 'moments', 'actually', 'overall', 'impact', 'film', 'story', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'extremely', 'outrageous', 'be', 'funny', 'media', 'constantly', 'bombards', 'crazy', 'situations', 'evolve', 'where', 'infidelity', 'divorce', 'are', 'concerned', 'extremes', 'divorce', 'lawyers', 'will', 'go', 'supposedly', 'interests', 'clients.George', 'Clooney', 'Miles', 'Massey', 'media', 'anointed', 'star', 'divorce', 'lawyer', 'continually', 'burnishing', 'image', 'way', 'imaginable', 'Catherine', 'Zeta', 'Jones', 'Marylin', 'Rexroth', 'sleuth', 'rich', 'husband', 'Rex', 'Rexroth', 'Edward', 'Hermann', 'act', 'marital', 'infidelity', 'determines', 'divorce', 'settlement', 'will', 'be', 'path', 'riches', 'independence', 'When', 'Miles', 'depriving', 'expected', 'windfall', 'hilarious', 'courtroom', 'scene', 'clear', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'end', 'story', 'getting', 'bored', 'repetitiveness', 'success', 'looking', 'new', 'challenges', 'still', 'searching', 'path', 'life', 'luxury', 'story', 'proceeds', 'unclear', 'end', 'who', 'really', 'being', 'entrapped', 'primarily', 'game', 'one', 'upmanship', 'two', 'how', 'much', 'stakes', 'are', 'financial', 'how', 'much', 'emotional', 'wonderful', 'supporting', 'cast', 'great', 'character', 'actors', 'including', 'others', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'fantastic', 'role', 'Marylin', 'new', 'love', 'interest', '.George', 'Clooney', 'work', 'always', 'enjoyable', 'Catherine', 'Zeta', 'Jones', 'easy', 'watch', 'addition', 'performances', 'remainder', 'cast', 'complemented', 'stars', 'provided', 'truly', 'funny', 'moments', 'However', 'totality', 'film', 'was', 'somewhat', 'disappointing', 'indicated', 'earlier', 'basic', 'story', 'had', 'enough', 'clever', 'elements', 'comedic', 'potential', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'told', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'penchant', 'bizarre', 'extreme', 'was', 'clearly', 'essential', 'success', 'RAISING', 'ARIZONA', 'FARGO', 'O', 'BROTHER', 'WHERE', 'ART', 'THOU', 'rating', 'compromise', 'four', 'actors', 'storyline', 'two', 'onscreen', 'implementation', 'basic', 'idea.Tucker', 'Andersen']",Intolerable Cruelty

Then I saw it was a Coen brothers' picture. I knew then that this wasn't going to be the typical romantic comedy. And it's not.The Coen's have a knack for updating old films and giving them their own little twist (THE HUDSUCKER PROXY, O'BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?). In INTOLERABLE CRUELTY the Coen's update those charming 1930-1950's romantic comedies (often starring Cary Grant or somebody with his looks) that we love so much. Clooney is once again the lead man playing a lawyer who has it all, but love. In some ways, his character is a continuation of the one he played in O'BROTHER, for example in O'BROTHER his character was fascinated by his hair and in INTOLERABLE CRUELTY his character is obsessed with his teeth. Both films deal with a journey, but this time Clooney's character already is king of his world and he hasn't lost his kingdom (at least not initially).Catherine Zeta-Jones turns in a delightful performance as the man-hater trying to catch a rich husband. Zeta-Jones is a wonderful actress and for a change, it's a joy seeing someone who has a more, realistic figure, than many of the other leading ladies currently at the top of the game in Hollywood.The plot of INTOLERABLE CRUELTY is as convoluted as every other Coen picture and would take awhile to explain. Under an average director, the film would have suffered terribly.

I only laugh when it is done darkly and with more effort than what was exerted on this movie.The Coen Brothers normally bring magic and obscurity to the screen in their movies but this film is sadly lacking much originality. The story revolves around sneaky, greedy lawyers and gold-digger Hollywood wives who try to outdo one another all for a little cash. It isn't a story deeply thought out or highly imaginative as I suspect the same story has been told over and over again by many other filmmakers with less of a gift for a gag.George Clooney only added some pretty white choppers and a decent face to the screen. His character is shallow and not very funny, Clooney tried, but nothing happened in my opinion. Catherine Zeta-Jones comes across somehow too familiar as the vain and money hungry Hollywood wife bent on marriage and divorce one too many times. In a land filled with Botok, silicon, and far too much time you would have thought something funny could have been found to talk about. The bright spots in the film are offered by Billy Bob Thornton, Geoffrey Rush and Cedric (the Entertainer) as sidekicks to the pretty regulars.

Here the brothers attempt a romantic comedy with dashes of screwball thrown in for good measure. Although ""Intolerable Cruelty"" can't quite stand with the best work the Cohens have done, it's a bright and breezy step away from the really dark humor that has characterized their best work. As usual, though, the duo are still original enough to subvert a number of the genre's cliches. The bottom line, it's entertaining as heck and a pleasant way to spend the evening.Miles Massey (George Clooney) a seasoned divorce lawyer has finally met his match in the love 'em and leaves 'em Marilyn Rexroth (Catherine Zeta Jones). Massey represents Mr. Rexroth (Edward Herrmann) in the divorce . Despite the fact that they are on opposite sides of the fence, Massey and Mrs. Rexroth find an instant attraction and share a cynical outlook on romance and the institution of marriage. We get to watch the two dance around each other expecting betrayal but, in the process, they discover they really were made for each other. Featured witty dialogue, the Cohens' brand of off-beat humor and a number of interesting (Bruce Campbell, Billy Bob Thornton, Geoffrey Rush and Julia Duffy), Intolerable Cruelty at times recalls the best work of Preston Sturges and even Alfred Hitchcock's romantic comedy/suspense films. Although it isn't quite up to Sturges, Hitchcock or Lubitsch, it's a huge improvement over the bulk of the formulaic romantic comedies that Hollywood has been force feeding us over the past decade.Both the lead actors recall romantic comedy stars from the past with their spectacular performances. In the case of Clooney, he reminds me a bit of Cary Grant's breezy performances and Zeta-Jones recalls Grace Kelley's work in Hitchcock's ""To Catch a Thief"". The supporting cast is equally strong and up to the task of trying to revive a genre that has fallen into cliches.""Intolerable Cruelty"" demonstrates that the Cohen brothers continue to master a wide variety of genres bending each to their artistic vision.

All the elements for a good, cynical screwball comedy seem to be in place here, so it's difficult to tell exactly where things went wrong.Miles Massey (George Clooney) is a successful and ruthless divorce attorney who meets his match in the beautiful and equally ruthless divorcee Marilyn Rexroth (Catherine Zeta-Jones), accumulator of wealthy spouses. When romantic sparks fly between them, both find their feelings of venerability more than a little unsettling; love may be in the air, but so is the strong stench of distrust.One of the biggest problems with the film is that sparks DON'T fly between Clooney and Zeta-Jones. Both have strong personalities and both possess a keen sense of comic timing, so why the serious disconnect? Perhaps it's the structure of the script: There's one con game too many perpetrated, and since we can't take anything on face value, their resultant romance never seems credible. A parade of comic eccentrics-including a chatterbox millionaire (Billy Bob Thornton), a cuckolded husband (Geoffrey Rush), a low-rent divorce attorney (Cedric the Entertainer), and Jones' philandering ex (Edward Herrmann)-march through the plot at various intervals. Most of these supporting turns come across as desperate attempts to enliven the proceedings; although all of the actors are adept farceurs, they're handed material unworthy of their abilities. Only during its final act, with the introduction of an asthmatic hit man (Irwin Keyes), does the film achieve the goofy gusto prevalent in the Coens' other work.INTOLERABLE CRUELTY always seems to be within pouncing distance of great farce, yet it never really connects.

The subject of divorce has been beaten to death and not a very funny subject matter when one really thinks about it.  The fact that the film is about rich people going through a divorce is even more suspect.  However, the performances and screwball-type comedy/script saves the film from sinking.  George Clooney is especially good in his comedic performance as the Divorce Lawyer, Miles Massey. Clooney's deliberate feat of overacting layered with double takes and eye-popping facial expressions are pretty funny  as it gives a sharp contrast to his smooth and handsome exterior. Catherine Zeta Jones as Marylin Rexroth is cool, unaffecting and just an eyeful to look at. Both characters play a cat-and-mouse game of love, swindling, and deceit. The support cast is equally hilarious to keep it interesting with Geoffrey Rush as Donovan Donnell and Cedric the Entertainer as Gus Petch.  One outstanding and hilarious character is Freddy Bender played by Richard Jenkins.  He plays Massey's/Clooney co-lawyer at the firm Massey works at. He matches Clooney with the facial expressions except he cries a lot more than Clooney's character.  Had the film been a major-major hit, the continuous line of leaving oneself ""exposed"" might have been added to the American lexicon of catch-phrases.
