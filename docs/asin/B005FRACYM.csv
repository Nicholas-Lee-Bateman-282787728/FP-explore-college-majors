He was the first player in the history of the show to prove that switching alliances at the right time can keep you in the game longer.  This season was also one of the original strategic seasons.  After Survivor 8, a new school type game was brought to the table which, in my opinion, isn't as great as the older seasons.  This would probably be in the Survivor top ten seasons and I really recommend it.  And both Rob Cesternino and Jenna Morasca have made careers out of this show.

This is really one of the better Survivor box-sets out there. First, it is in a single, regular-sized DVD case and is on a very reasonable 5 discs. This is a huge step up from the Africa, Marquesas, and Heroes vs. Villains releases, which were each on 9-10 discs and had three regular sized cases without a box holding them together. This is very clunky both for carrying and display. The episodes are perfectly preserved in their original airing format, so people that are complaining about nudity being blurred need to realize that this is supposed to be a remotely family-oriented show. It airs with a TV-PG rating, so there is only so much that they can get away with. Even some language that other shows get away with is censored. The bonus content is fairly substantial for a season that is almost 10 years old now. It has all of the complete exit interviews and Morning Show interviews, plus several featurettes. People who are complaining about these being manufactured on On Demand discs need to get over themselves.

His witty antics earned him the title of smartest player never to win the game by Jeff Probst. There are 2 really stuck up girls in Jenna and Heidi and they think there at a disadvantage because of how pretty they are. Rob eventually puts them in their place, but Jenna has the last laugh. Rob makes an alliance with Matthew because he's afraid he will go psycho and kill everyone in the tribe. I thought Matthew was normal but the edit really played up his craziness of sharpening a machete and everyone commenting on how creepy he is. Rob also makes an alliance with a deaf girl and because of her indecisiveness Rob has to let her go. This season started off as men vs. women and the men struggle at first but eventually level the playing field.

For the first time a game twist actually helped make the season more interesting and didn't diminish my thoughts on how good the season was.The cast was very interesting to me, there were many great people to watch (Rob, Matt, Roger, Heidi, Jenna, Christy) and even those I hated, I didn't hate with nearly as much passion as I did back with seasons 4 and 5. This season's merge was just as interesting as the pre merge as many personalities frequently kept me hooked. The final results were satisfying and although I think the final two was comprised of random people, we got good air time with them and the winner did have to work to earn his/her spot in the top two.I do feel the most deserving person to win came up short (And I do like that person, dispite a couple bad decisions but it was only game moves I hated.
