Spoiled brat city gal meets a hardened man - and supposedly their meeting changes each one's life for the better.  Sad to think that at their age, they are still stuck in a stereotype that has kept them both from 'growing up' & any personal understanding.

The two main characters, played by Christina Karis and Jefferson Moore, were splendid and very funny. Their facial expressions were fabulous!This is obviously a &#34;home grown&#34; movie and it shows in the mediocre quality of the supporting cast and production. For example, the automobile club operator was silly and amateurish. The green-screen effects used to create the passing scenes viewed out the truck door windows were crude (edges of the green screen were too soft and out-of-focus elements like Ms. Karis' shoulder made a poor transition).But the reason I gave this gem 5 stars in spite of these and other shortcomings is because of the great story, excellent pacing, humor and superb acting by Karis and Moore. Plus, the soundtrack includes refreshingly good original music. It elevated the movie to a very entertaining and enjoyable experience.If you'd like to relax with a funny movie with a warm heart and a poignant message, this is your movie!",5,Nice film about reconnecting with core values and people.,1393459200,"02 27, 2014",2014,1103,"['enjoyed', 'plot', 'very', 'much', 'always', 'fun', 'see', 'two', 'people', 'such', 'different', 'backgrounds', 'thrust', 'together', '34', 'adventure', '34', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'played', 'Christina', 'Karis', 'Jefferson', 'Moore', 'were', 'splendid', 'very', 'funny', 'facial', 'expressions', 'were', 'fabulous', 'obviously', '34', 'home', 'grown', '34', 'movie', 'mediocre', 'quality', 'supporting', 'cast', 'production', 'example', 'automobile', 'club', 'operator', 'was', 'silly', 'amateurish', 'green-screen', 'effects', 'used', 'create', 'passing', 'scenes', 'viewed', 'out', 'truck', 'door', 'windows', 'were', 'crude', 'edges', 'green', 'screen', 'were', 'too', 'soft', 'out-of-focus', 'elements', 'Ms.', 'Karis', 'shoulder', 'made', 'poor', 'transition', 'reason', 'gave', 'gem', '5', 'stars', 'spite', 'other', 'shortcomings', 'great', 'story', 'excellent', 'pacing', 'humor', 'superb', 'acting', 'Karis', 'Moore', 'soundtrack', 'refreshingly', 'good', 'original', 'music', 'elevated', 'movie', 'very', 'entertaining', 'enjoyable', 'experience.If', ""'d"", 'like', 'relax', 'funny', 'movie', 'warm', 'heart', 'poignant', 'message', 'movie']",Backroads & Lilies

1618326,ABC8FXLD7W528,B00AXGX59E,"Penny Zeller, Christian Author and Speaker","[8, 9]","Alza Bennett's car breaks down and leaves her stranded in the middle of nowhere. How will she ever make it home for Easter now? After a series of mishaps, she stumbles across a hermit fixing his tractor. Moments later, she has convinced him to drive her several hundred miles to her parents' house. After all, it's imperative she makes it home for Easter.Lincoln has no desire to be pestered by anyone, let alone a spoiled woman with no thoughts of anyone but herself. However, he agrees to drive her, and on the way they encounter all kinds of hilarious calamities.At this point, it doesn't seem like Alza will ever make it home. And if she doesn't, how will she ever make that good impression on her family that she is striving so hard to make?Backroads and Lilies is one of those movies I hadn't heard much about until I saw it on the shelf of a local store.  I wondered if it would be a good movie. I wasn't disappointed.While it starts off a bit slow at first, the momentum quickly builds. Jefferson Moore who plays Lincoln is perfect for the role with his crusty glares. (He also played in one of my favorite movies of all time, Clancy). Christina Karis, who plays Alza has delightful facial expressions and plays her role well.Backroads and Lilies is full of great lessons. First of all, lying never solves anything, which Alza soon finds out. Secondly, God teaches us to put others before ourselves (Philippians 2:3). Alza clearly doesn't do this and soon learns an important lesson.  Third, serving others can make a huge difference, as Lincoln discovers. His choice not only helps Alza, but also makes a difference in his life as well.Backroads and Lilies is a wonderful story of redemption. It includes humor, as well as touching moments. There is nothing objectionable and I would highly recommend it for those ages 8 and above. Younger children may not understand the plot and story line.I originally reviewed and added this movie to my Mom-Approved Movie Listing on my Wordpress blog.",5,Full of Great Lessons!,1369008000,"05 20, 2013",2013,1998,"['Alza', 'Bennett', 'car', 'breaks', 'down', 'stranded', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'How', 'will', 'ever', 'make', 'home', 'Easter', 'now', 'series', 'mishaps', 'hermit', 'fixing', 'tractor', 'Moments', 'later', 'convinced', 'drive', 'several', 'hundred', 'miles', 'parents', 'house', 'imperative', 'home', 'Easter.Lincoln', 'desire', 'be', 'pestered', 'anyone', 'let', 'alone', 'spoiled', 'woman', 'thoughts', 'anyone', 'However', 'drive', 'way', 'encounter', 'kinds', 'hilarious', 'calamities.At', 'point', ""n't"", 'seem', 'Alza', 'will', 'ever', 'make', 'home', ""n't"", 'how', 'will', 'ever', 'make', 'good', 'impression', 'family', 'striving', 'so', 'hard', 'make', 'Backroads', 'Lilies', 'one', 'movies', 'had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'much', 'saw', 'shelf', 'local', 'store', 'wondered', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed.While', 'bit', 'slow', 'first', 'momentum', 'quickly', 'builds', 'Jefferson', 'Moore', 'who', 'plays', 'Lincoln', 'perfect', 'role', 'crusty', 'glares', 'also', 'played', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'time', 'Clancy', 'Christina', 'Karis', 'who', 'Alza', 'delightful', 'facial', 'expressions', 'role', 'well.Backroads', 'Lilies', 'full', 'great', 'lessons', 'First', 'lying', 'never', 'anything', 'Alza', 'soon', 'out', 'Secondly', 'God', 'put', 'others', 'ourselves', 'Philippians', '2:3', 'clearly', ""n't"", 'do', 'soon', 'important', 'lesson', 'Third', 'serving', 'others', 'can', 'make', 'huge', 'difference', 'Lincoln', 'discovers', 'choice', 'not', 'only', 'Alza', 'also', 'difference', 'life', 'well.Backroads', 'Lilies', 'wonderful', 'story', 'redemption', 'humor', 'as', 'well', 'touching', 'moments', 'nothing', 'objectionable', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'ages', '8', 'above', 'Younger', 'children', 'may', 'not', 'understand', 'plot', 'story', 'line.I', 'originally', 'reviewed', 'added', 'movie', 'Mom-Approved', 'Movie', 'Listing', 'Wordpress', 'blog']",Backroads & Lilies
