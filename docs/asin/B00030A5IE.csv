The aerobics session is the more challenging one for obvious reasons - it is designed to get you moving and your heart rate up.Gilad, in his usual kind (yet also bit forceful at the same time) manners leads you through a warm up then gets to the serious business of making your heart rate go up then cools you down in a series of moves which are mainly traditional stlyes moves but some with his own take on them.Beautiful setting with great instruction make this a keeper.",5,Two Killer Routines,1231027200,"01 4, 2009",2009,621,"['Gilad', 'going', 'routines', 'designed', 'provide', 'aerobic', 'exercise', 'one', 'sessions', 'toning', 'workout', 'session', 'aerobics', 'session', 'more', 'challenging', 'one', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'designed', 'get', 'moving', 'heart', 'rate', 'up.Gilad', 'usual', 'kind', 'yet', 'also', 'bit', 'forceful', 'same', 'time', 'manners', 'warm', 'up', 'then', 'serious', 'business', 'making', 'heart', 'rate', 'go', 'up', 'then', 'down', 'series', 'moves', 'are', 'mainly', 'traditional', 'stlyes', 'moves', 'own', 'take', 'them.Beautiful', 'setting', 'great', 'instruction', 'make', 'keeper']",The 45/45 Split Routine Workout

I needed an alternative for the nights I couldn't go to the gym and based on the reviews purchased this DVD.  It takes a LOT to really give me a workout.  I am a marathon runner and a lifetime athlete but this video really does it for me.Normally I am disappointed in the instructional areobic videos that I have but this was a slam dunk.  The first 45 minute routine is fast paced and intense.  His moves are simple but connect and build on one another.  You will feel your heart pumping and work up a sweat but won't feel exhausted after his workout.  More like energized and feelnig accomplished.  His cool downs and warm ups should not be skipped because they prevent soreness.His muscle toning excercises kicked my butt!  Again all the movements are small and simple not requiring any equipment or advanced knowledge of excercise but wow are they effective.  You will feel the strain on your muscles and he hits your abs, inner and outer thighs, buttocks, arms, shoulders and chest.  It was so intense I really was expecting to hurt the next day but again the cool down is so effective that I had very little soreness and felt great afterwards.Just as a side note this is not for the casual athlete.  You should be in decent shape and have some coordination if you expect to get through these routines.  If you are a beginner to areobics get his low impact stuff and build up to this later.",5,Best overall workout you can expect from a DVD,1171238400,"02 12, 2007",2007,1528,"['have', 'been', 'hardcore', 'Gilad', 'fan', '80s', 'when', 'was', 'little', 'kid', 'inspired', 'way', 'back', 'then', 'do', 'workouts', 'needed', 'alternative', 'nights', 'could', ""n't"", 'go', 'gym', 'based', 'reviews', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'LOT', 'really', 'give', 'workout', 'am', 'marathon', 'runner', 'lifetime', 'athlete', 'video', 'really', 'me.Normally', 'am', 'disappointed', 'instructional', 'areobic', 'have', 'was', 'slam', 'dunk', 'first', '45', 'minute', 'routine', 'fast', 'paced', 'intense', 'moves', 'are', 'simple', 'connect', 'build', 'one', 'will', 'feel', 'heart', 'pumping', 'work', 'up', 'sweat', 'wo', ""n't"", 'feel', 'exhausted', 'workout', 'More', 'energized', 'feelnig', 'accomplished', 'cool', 'downs', 'warm', 'ups', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'skipped', 'prevent', 'soreness.His', 'muscle', 'toning', 'excercises', 'kicked', 'butt', 'Again', 'movements', 'are', 'small', 'simple', 'not', 'requiring', 'equipment', 'advanced', 'knowledge', 'excercise', 'wow', 'are', 'effective', 'will', 'feel', 'strain', 'muscles', 'abs', 'inner', 'outer', 'thighs', 'buttocks', 'arms', 'shoulders', 'chest', 'was', 'so', 'intense', 'really', 'was', 'expecting', 'hurt', 'next', 'day', 'again', 'cool', 'down', 'so', 'effective', 'had', 'very', 'little', 'soreness', 'felt', 'great', 'afterwards.Just', 'side', 'note', 'not', 'casual', 'athlete', 'should', 'be', 'decent', 'shape', 'have', 'coordination', 'expect', 'get', 'routines', 'are', 'beginner', 'areobics', 'get', 'low', 'impact', 'stuff', 'build', 'up', 'later']",The 45/45 Split Routine Workout

My wife introduced me to all of her other workout DVDs which are great but the cardio hardly makes a sweat pearl run.  Then she suggested Gilad.  I am just very slightly overweight and I am getting now back into shape.  Gilad makes me swim in sweat doing cardio.  He also makes me not hungry after the workout which is also a good sign of a good workout, so you don't overeat and put the weight back on.After the anaerobic toning workout part my WHOLE body is completely weak and tired, but I am not hurting.  Another good sign of a good workout, because ""pain is the bodies natural sign to make you stop"" (Arnold Schwarzenegger).  Gilad does the perfect workout for men.  Women are not excluded.

It would probably not challenge a non-beginner enough.Some things I like: you get two workouts on one DVD, which is nice.  Makes it worth the money.
