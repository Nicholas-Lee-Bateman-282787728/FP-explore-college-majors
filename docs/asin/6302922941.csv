As a young boyit was easy to relate to him. This lad was always getting in trouble cause he wasdifferent than the others. He was a thinker....Here a good one for today's society....when he got punished....he got whipped witha leather belt or something...and you could hear his cries of pain....My o My...this is violence ...if our politicians hears about this...this film or thescenes will probably be cut out of the film... as today's parents are made out ofjello and our teenagers are swarming others...Great film, a keeper for sure.",4,They sure dont make good movies like this anymore...,1273536000,"05 11, 2010",2010,839,"['Enjoyed', 'movie', 'on/off', 'last', 'couple', 'centuries', 'so', 'much', 'old', 'movies', 'sets..the', 'acting', 'old', 'clothes', 'also', 'had', 'great', 'actor/actresses', 'worked', 'harder', 'today', 'spoiled', 'set', 'made', 'movieeven', 'better', 'little', 'story', 'have', 'young', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'young', 'boyit', 'was', 'easy', 'relate', 'lad', 'was', 'always', 'getting', 'trouble', 'cause', 'wasdifferent', 'others', 'was', 'thinker', '.Here', 'good', 'one', 'today', 'society', 'got', 'punished', '.he', 'got', 'whipped', 'witha', 'leather', 'belt', 'something', 'could', 'hear', 'cries', 'pain', '.My', 'violence', 'politicians', 'hears', 'film', 'thescenes', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'cut', 'film', 'today', 'parents', 'are', 'made', 'out', 'ofjello', 'teenagers', 'are', 'swarming', 'others', 'Great', 'film', 'keeper', 'sure']",Young Tom Edison VHS

Young Tom Edison is one of those unique Hollywood gems that fits the bill perfectly.  Every year I show this film I hear the same thing:  &quot;A[...] we HAVE to watch a black &amp; white film ?&quot;  &quot;These old films are never any good!&quot;  &quot;How old is this ?&quot;  &quot;Is the real Tom Edison in this?&quot;Every year I start this film hearing comments like this, but without fail, kids are laughing and really enjoying the film after just 10 minutes.  After the first day (it takes two days to show Young Tom), kids can't wait to see the rest!  It's that good!  Mickey Rooney is perfect as the irrepressible Young Tom:  both charming and curious almost to a fault, Tom blunders his way into big problems and then brilliantly uses science to get himself out of the trouble.

While some of the events portrayed in the movie are most likely fiction, (the ending is a bit of a stretch to believe as actual history) this movie is still a delightful piece which tries to answer the question, &quot;What would one of the world's greatest innovators, misunderstood, mocked and ridiculed as a boy, have been like in those days?&quot;  The casting is marvelous.  Not only does Rooney shine as the head-in-the-clouds, chemistry-brilliant young Edison, but both Fay Bainter and Norman Taurog give believable performances as hardy, hard-working Midwesterners doing the best they can to understand their decidedly odd young son. Virginia Weidler (of Philadelphia Story fame) delivers a remarkable performance as Edison's younger sister, Tannie.The upshot is: if you're looking for a lighthearted approach to history and are willing to suspend your disbelief for a couple of hours.

However, as a child, his eccentric behavior and overactive mind got him into trouble.

Ironically, in the part of a highly active and sometimes twitchy man, Rooney is much more subdued. It is an interesting portrayal, but do not expect to see the guy from all those musicals.
