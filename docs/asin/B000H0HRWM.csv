Yes?(Like what about MGM & Universal?) But I know of no otheranalytical documentary of &#34;noir&#34; that does such an intelligent job coveringthis kind of movie -- at least to date.,4,Best thing of its kind currently available in documentary form.,1391904000,"02 9, 2014",2014,342,"['Unfortunately', 'analysis', 'mainly', 'Warner', 'films', 'when', 'actual', 'genreis', 'so', 'much', 'wider', 'deeper', 'more', 'culturally', 'extensive', 'one', 'studio', 'Yes', 'what', 'MGM', 'Universal', 'know', 'otheranalytical', 'documentary', '34', '34', 'intelligent', 'job', 'coveringthis', 'kind', 'movie', 'least', 'date']",Film Noir: Bringing Darkness to Light

Many disagree whether it is a genre or a style or haven't even tried to define it.  By studying the disc I came to the conclusion NOIR is a style that influences lighting designers and cinemaphotographers and directors and commonly has a female character that gets the lead male -a social outsider in a tense relationship with the law - into terminal trouble.",4,A superb examination of the essence of NOIR,1397433600,"04 14, 2014",2014,578,"['point', 'people', 'film', 'industry', 'think', 'NOIR', 'was', 'important', 'contribution', 'world', 'cinema', 'flourished', '1945', '1960', 'been', 'enormous', 'influence', 'film', 'makers', 'world', 'Many', 'disagree', 'genre', 'style', 'have', ""n't"", 'even', 'tried', 'define', 'studying', 'disc', 'came', 'conclusion', 'NOIR', 'style', 'lighting', 'designers', 'cinemaphotographers', 'directors', 'commonly', 'female', 'character', 'lead', 'male', '-a', 'social', 'outsider', 'tense', 'relationship', 'law', 'terminal', 'trouble']",Film Noir: Bringing Darkness to Light
