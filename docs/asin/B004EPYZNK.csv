That film also had Camilla Belle, she gave an excellent performance there, so I decided to watch this film because, well, it was ""free.""  At least since I have Amazon Prime.Now, ""The Quiet"" was a real surprise, a far better film than critics wanted to give it credit for.  This film, on the other hand, is a by-the-book-and-by-the-numbers RomCom, where you pretty much know everything that is going to happen before it ever does.  Why?  Well, even if you haven't seen this film before -- which I hadn't until this weekend -- I had seen it probably a thousand times before:  Girl gets guy, girl loses guy, . . . . Well, you get the picture.But this film isn't completely awful.  There are some funny moments, and Ms. Belle is pretty good here as the riches-to-rags-to-riches damsel in distress.  But she's actually more than that; while her sister seems hopeless to fend for herself, Ms. Belle is more of a modern-day gal who could probably make it through the day without some dude.Ah, but why should Ms. Belle have to live this way?  You'll have to watch to find out for yourself, even though you'll know how it ends just as it's starting.

1398448,A35XUI9HGMAJEX,B004EPYZNK,Carlisle Wheeling,"[3, 4]","I admit it; when I first saw the title of this movie, I figured it was going to be just like that lousy movie the Duff sisters did years earlier.  I decided to watch it on cable last night, sticking to my new rule that, if a movie doesn't hold my interest after the first 20 minutes, it goes off.  Even a bad movie can do that as opposed to something boring, and I ended up not only keeping it on, but loving it!True, there is nothing ground breaking here in plot, but I'll admit I didn't see a lot of parallel between the story and Sense and Sensibility (And I've seen the BBC adaptation with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle), but I have to say this is the best romantic dramedy I've seen in some time since While You Were Sleeping.  The reason is simple:  aside from the one scene where Alexa Vega's character Mary was obviously sleeping with the literary professor, it was clean, charming, and contained a good moral lesson on society's dictates.Mary and Norah (Camilla Bell), two sisters couldn't be more different, are virtually tossed out of their home after their bankrupt father dies by their half-brother's nasty fiancee', Olivia (played very convincingly by April Bowlby) and have no choice but to move into the home of their kindly Tia Aurelia (a charming and likeable Adriana Barraza).  While Norah willingly foregoes law school to obtain a job and adjusts relatively well to the girls' new lowly status, Mary still wants desperately to go back to the lifestyle she has been accustomed to, and thinks this will come about by hooking up with her lit teacher.  She blows off the admiration of Aurelia's neighbor Bruno (Wilmer Valderrama, Fez from That 70s Show), and keeps running around dressed like she never left her old life behind, managing to keep her tresses golden, and never admitting to being Mexican unless the tough neighborhood girls give her a hard time.Norah has troubles of her own; she has a ten year plan to become a top lawyer, but Olivia's decidedly nicer brother Edward (Nicholas D'Agosto) has romantic designs on her.I don't want to give too much away, but the girls find out that life doesn't necessarily turn out a certain way just because that's what you want, and they both have some growing up to do--especially Mary, the epitome of Barbie syndrome.  Chock full of funny cultural and societal jokes, yet serious enough to be moved by all the characters, this is an enchanting film that the whole family can watch.  It also has nice Latino cultural accents, a great soundtrack, and nice cinematography.  Spanish subtitles are nice too, because my espanol no es tan bueno.  It makes me want to become fluent again as I watched the girls slowly learn to make it their second language.  Though the ending turned out like I thought it MIGHT, there were still some pleasant twists and turns I didn't see coming, which was a welcome surprise.  The biggest surprise was seeing Wilmer Valderrama play such a cool, confident, strong character as opposed to the bumbling, comical Fez.  I had a great time watching this film, was left with the warm fuzzies, and if you like romantic dramedies with a little something distinctive so it's not completely cookie cutter, this one is for you.

1398451,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B004EPYZNK,Chris Pandolfi,"[16, 25]","I'm not going to spend the next couple of paragraphs pinpointing the differences between ""From Prada to Nada"" and the novel it's based on, Jane Austin's ""Sense and Sensibility."" I'm going to judge it on its own terms, for I know that stories have been the inspiration for other stories pretty much as long as the genre has existed. And so, on its own terms, ""From Prada to Nada"" is an exhausted, simple-minded romantic comedy with a Latin twist. That it gets by at all can only be attributed to the charm and personality of stars Camilla Bell and Alexa Vega. And even then there are problems because their roles are inauthentic and only in service of the plot, which is itself so predictable that it suggests a negative assumption on the intelligence of the audience.Bell and Vega play Nora and Mary Dominguez, young sisters living carefree, fabulously wealthy lives in Beverly Hills. When their father suddenly dies of a heart attack (on his birthday, of all days), they discover he was an irresponsible risk-taker and was ready to file for bankruptcy. This, in effect, renders his will meaningless. They also learn of his illegitimate son, Gabriel (Pablo Cruz), whose fianc&eacute;e, the venomous Olivia (April Bowlby), callously evicts the sisters with little more than the clothes on their backs. Penniless and orphaned, they're forced to move away from the sheltered affluence of Beverly Hills into the modesty of East Los Angeles, where they take residence with their aunt, Aurelia (Adrianna Bazzara).Nora, the more responsible and less materialistic of the pair, adjusts fairly well to the new neighborhood. To make ends meet, she quits law school and takes a job at a law firm, where her boss is Edward (Nicholas D'Agosto), Olivia's kindly but reserved brother. The romantic tension is underwhelming but obviously significant to the story, so we're made to notice even if they have little if any chemistry. Nora keeps Edward at a distance, since falling in love doesn't gel with her ten-year plan. When they're not dancing around the issue of their feelings, they're handing a case that Nora landed during a bus ride to work, because let's face it, that's how all lawyers find clients; a group of Hispanic janitors, who were fired for allegedly stealing cleaning supplies, want to sue their former employer for wages that amount to an hour's less work than they put in.Mary, spoiled and ignorant, doesn't easily adjust to East L.A. Here are some of the things she says about her situation: ""We're going to get shot."" ""No more shopping. No more high protein diet. Poor people only eat carbs."" Although the location has changed, she still dresses in designer clothing and stiletto heels, and her hair and makeup seem oddly professional, as if she still had access to expensive salons. In school, she falls for a hunky literature T.A., who she believes can get her back into Beverly Hills. We already know this won't work out, for she has already met Bruno (Wilmer Valderrama), Aurelia's neighbor from across the street. He and Mary hit it off like oil and water, mostly because, according to her standards, he just doesn't look the part. This character is little more than a pawn, included only to teach Mary - and the audience - about the value of not judging a book by its cover.The movie displays a clear sense of humor when it comes to Mexican stereotypes, and admittedly, some of them are funny. My favorite gag was when Aurelia sees Edward at her door and panics, believing him to be an immigration officer; her relatives, who work in a makeshift clothing factory in the living room, frantically hide their sewing machines and turn the television to a channel showing a Dodgers baseball game. Many of them, however, are not all that funny; my least favorite was a recurring joke about Mary and Nora not being able to speak Spanish, despite the fact that they live in Los Angeles. They represent a thematic undercurrent, namely the sisters learning to embrace their Hispanic roots.A film about cultural discovery and self-acceptance is perfectly fine. But ""From Prada to Nada"" is at heart a romantic comedy, a genre so innately preposterous that anything serious or compelling is overshadowed. Furthermore, the material is about as predictable as it can get.

The movie far exceeded expectations for me.The premise of the story is two rich, and totally opposite 20 somethings are left penniless when their father has a heart attack on his 55th birthday.  They are devastated, but even moreso when they realize he actually had filed for bankruptcy and the high life would soon change for them, when they move from their mansion near Rodeo Drive to their aunt's home in East LA.  One sister is going to law school and she is the one that adapts the best, the other can't quite make the transition to the new neighborhood.  One of the best lines in the film is when she judges a guy she sees on the street who is wearing a hoody and looks a little scruffy, saying ""Are you Homeless?"" and he says ""No, are you?"".  Yeah, that one was tough.  Can't judge a book.....Though this looked more like a comedy, and had comedic moments it is more a story about how family, tradition and heritage are so important and having a good life doesn't necessarily mean having all the material things that you want.  Both sisters learn important lessons in their fall from Prada to Nada and come out the better for it.I did not know any of the actors in the film, but felt that the acting was good and the story, though a bit predictable was very enjoyable.

I greatly enjoyed the music score, which ranged from classic mariachi songs to upbeat Salsa.I was happy with the cast, and Adriana Barraza (the maid from Babel) steals every scene as aunt Aurelia Jimenez.  Wilmer Valderrama is convincing (though cliche-chasing) as the cholo with a heart, and it's great to see him in something different than the ""Fez"" type characters.The downside is that the film is a little light on laughs.  There are a few laugh-out-loud moments, though they aren't frequent in this movie.  There are definitely a few jokes and moments in the film that would be more funny to Spanish speakers, or at least anyone familiar with Mexican-American culture.Camilla Belle is a solid actress, though I wasn't too sure about her being cast as the lead.  Granted Belle's half-Brazilian in real life, but it was bizarre that the producers spray tanned her a nuclear orange color in order to ""look the part"" of a Mexicana.Like plenty of rom-coms, From Prada to Nada is certainly predictable, although there were a few minor twists and turns along the way.As a guy, I thought this was a lighthearted watch, and worth a rental.

Fina Torres & Luis Alfaro, based on the novelSense and Sensibility (Dover Thrift Editions)by Jane Austen, 2011, 107 minutes) is a delightful family film and one of the best classic adaptations I have ever seen. With proper nods to Emma Thompson's crowning achievement as adaptationist/writer of the Ang Lee film versionSense And Sensibility(see my review), this film rang true in such a way that I imagined Austen would have written this if she had lived in modern times.The Dominguez sisters (Nora and Mary, played respectively by Camille Belle and Alexa Vega, based on Eleanor and Marianne Dashwood respectively) suffer the sudden loss of their father on his birthday - and soon find they have suffered the loss of their exquisite California mansion. At the reading of the will, they meet their hitherto unknown half-brother Gabriel, Jr., (Pablo Cruz, loosely based on Austen's John Dashwood) and his snotty wife Olivia (April Bowlby, based on Austen's Fanny Ferrars Dashwood).As it is Gabriel, Jr. who has all the money and the Dominguez sisters find their father was completely bankrupt, Gabriel and Olivia appear to buy the house out from under the girls. They end up living with their maternal aunt (Belita Moreno) in East L.A. There the cast is completely assembled: the wonderful Nicholas D'Agosto as Edward Ferris (doing a version of Hugh Grant's Edward Ferrars fromSense And Sensibility), Wilmer Valderrama as Bruno (based on Austen's Colonel Christopher Brandon and also beautifully reflecting Alan Rickman's turn in the role) and terrific cast of silly Mexican ladies bound to bring a smile to anyone's face.The skill, humor and necessary updates are powerful and smoothly done here. Though the acting was not up to snuff in many scenes - and I suspect this was either the fault of the director or time constraints - it generally satisfies. In my view an extra 15 minutes would have completely cleared up the illogical skips in the storyline, but one can enjoy this all the way through without them.My wife would probably laugh to know this but this film makes me weep as only the original novel used to do. Even Emma Thompson's skilled work in her film version fails to draw one single tear. This film has me weeping quietly at several stages. Also, I will do an unusual thing and advise you: the goofs or bloopers you THINK you catch in this film are not errors at all, and that adds flavor to the humor.Finally, I think anyone confused by certain events in the original novel will have at least some answers via this film. For example, Mary falls for the John Willoughby character, Rodrigo Fuentes (played by a slimy Kuno Becker) simply because she knows he can return her to some semblance of her former life. That is fairly true to the original novel though it is often missed.So get this and enjoy it as I did; do not fail to capture the expertly executed humor and fun.

There is an easy transition from english to spanish in the film, with the spanish dialogue subtitled.  This is a particularly charming aspect of the movie as the transition happens effortlessly and really lends to the comical aspect of the film.  Being hispanic myself,  only made it more endearing to me.  The family from East Los Angeles, reminded me so much of relatives and friends, I was crying with laughter!

This often happens in a really good way - WEST SIDE STORY is an example of a well done update of Shakespeare's ROMEO AND JULIET.  O PIONEERS was based on ancient Greek mythology.  CLUELESS was a pretty good update of Jane Austen's EMMA. Even Shakespeare himself based many of his plays on earlier stories that he adapted for the stage. These adaptations were done with a genuine understanding of the original works and were interesting takes on an older idea.  Art, music and literature would be nowhere if artists composers and writers could not build upon each other's work.But it really shouldn't be done by someone with less talent than the original artist, and there is no use for it unless it can in some way enhance, or at least equal the original. When a piece of art becomes the basis for new art, it needs to be more than a shoddy, lazy attempt to steal from an artist with greater talent.FROM PRADA TO NADA is just a cheap copy, with none of the depth, sensitivity, humor, or insight of SENSE AND SENSIBILITY.  It doesn't appear that the screenwriter has even the least understanding of the story he/she stole, but is simply capitalizing upon the current ""Jane Austen Craze"" to make a fast buck - exploiting not only Jane Austen, but the Mexican American culture in the process.  The whole thing is just weird.  No passion, no message, no depth.  Just poor acting and a poorly thought out script that has stolen it's core idea from a much greater work without giving back to the original in any way.The writers and producers of this movie should be ashamed.  If you have talent, then write your OWN original story.  If you have a very exceptioal talent, they MAYBE you can try to stand on the shoulders of giants that have gone before you and produce a work that enhances the beauty of a masterpiece.

I knew this was going to be a good film; when I saw the title.A responsible young woman and her irresponsible sister bicker, but deep down care for each other. They live in a mansion in Beverley-Hills. Their father dies, and they discover he was bankrupt, and so, now they too.This movie is unrepentant in promoting smoking marijuana and pre-marital-sex; despairing only of the results. I disagree with both of these sins. Thus, I cannot recommend this movie to teenagers, and removed one-star. Yet, setting aside this film was produced by unknowing, heathens; it is a film with heart, soul, and goodness.Alexa Vega plays the wayward sister. If, like me, you are wondering where you have seen this expressive actress before; it was ""Spy Kids"". She is all grown-up here. There is a lot of humor; most of which comes from Alexa.There is a lot to this film: romances, a mean-girl, a corrupt employer, relationships, selfish-greed vs. helping the down-trodden, and shallow-desire vs. true-love.You must suspend all belief; as the good-guy and good-girl are wealthy, corporate, lawyers working for free helping the poor.

I cannot believe it won any awards. It was basically a Mexican-American propaganda film. What else would you call it when one of the main characters states that of course he speaks Spanish - he lives in LA. The plot is beyond believable. Two girls are suddenly impoverished when their father drops dead of a heart attack. Unknown to them, he had been facing bankruptcy. At his funeral a brother the girls knew nothing about suddenly appears to claim his share of the inheritance. But there supposedly is none, remember? Yet they are allowed to keep the mansion they grew up in and everything in it. No creditor ever comes to take it away. But for some mysterious reason, the girls, who own 2/3 of the mansion and everything in it, foolishly sell it to their brother and end up penniless in the deal. Really stupid. They trounce off, penniless but owning a few expensive personal belongings to their poor aunt, who, even though she lives in LA, speaks virtually no English and who proceeds to sell everything of value the girls own and pocket the proceeds, in advance payment for their upkeep. There is a lot a mariachi music, which really sounds hokey and although there are some rough characters in the background, the poor Mexican part of town the girls end up in is mysteriously peopled by artists and various other good guys. Naturally, the girls end up alright in the end.People say this movie was based on sense and sensitivity and if it was it just showed the poor judgement of the producer and directer. Sense took place in a time and place when women did not inherit, which is the fatal flaw in this plot, as these girls did inherit the major share of a mufti-million dollar mansion and everything in it. They never took their brother to court to fight out the apportioning of the inheritance.but simply handed it over to him without a fight.",1,from prada to nada is nada,1400630400,"05 21, 2014",2014,1973,"['had', 'high', 'hopes', 'when', 'saw', 'trailer', 'film', 'hopes', 'were', 'not', 'realized', 'really', 'poorly', 'done', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'won', 'awards', 'was', 'basically', 'Mexican-American', 'propaganda', 'film', 'What', 'else', 'would', 'call', 'when', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'course', 'Spanish', 'LA', 'plot', 'believable', 'Two', 'girls', 'are', 'suddenly', 'impoverished', 'when', 'father', 'drops', 'dead', 'heart', 'attack', 'Unknown', 'had', 'been', 'facing', 'bankruptcy', 'funeral', 'brother', 'girls', 'knew', 'nothing', 'suddenly', 'claim', 'share', 'inheritance', 'supposedly', 'none', 'remember', 'are', 'allowed', 'keep', 'mansion', 'grew', 'up', 'everything', 'creditor', 'ever', 'take', 'away', 'mysterious', 'reason', 'girls', 'who', 'own', '2/3', 'mansion', 'everything', 'foolishly', 'sell', 'brother', 'end', 'up', 'penniless', 'deal', 'Really', 'stupid', 'trounce', 'off', 'penniless', 'owning', 'few', 'expensive', 'personal', 'belongings', 'poor', 'aunt', 'who', 'even', 'LA', 'virtually', 'English', 'who', 'sell', 'everything', 'value', 'girls', 'own', 'proceeds', 'advance', 'payment', 'upkeep', 'lot', 'mariachi', 'music', 'really', 'hokey', 'are', 'rough', 'characters', 'background', 'poor', 'Mexican', 'part', 'town', 'girls', 'end', 'up', 'mysteriously', 'peopled', 'artists', 'various', 'other', 'good', 'guys', 'Naturally', 'girls', 'end', 'up', 'alright', 'end.People', 'say', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'sense', 'sensitivity', 'was', 'just', 'showed', 'poor', 'judgement', 'producer', 'directer', 'Sense', 'took', 'place', 'time', 'place', 'when', 'women', 'did', 'not', 'inherit', 'fatal', 'flaw', 'plot', 'girls', 'did', 'inherit', 'major', 'share', 'mufti-million', 'dollar', 'mansion', 'everything', 'never', 'took', 'brother', 'court', 'fight', 'out', 'apportioning', 'inheritance.but', 'simply', 'handed', 'fight']",N/A
