566058,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000053VC7,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Python is probably one of the worst ""attack of the killer snake"" type movies ever.  The biggest problem I had is that after an hour, only ONE appearance by the gigantic king-size snake occurs!  The rest of that time is occupied with crappy and irrelevant dialogue mainly involving pointless chit chat between members of the police department.  When I say pointless I really mean it- you won't care about anything they have to say at *all*, I promise.  At least the last 30 minutes are saved thanks to the killer snake slithering through an underground facility, chasing teens and killing them one by one.  This is the reason the movie gets 2 stars out of me.  Everything else about the movie is forgettable, boring and excessively dialogue-heavy.",2,"ugh, another disappointing big snake movie!",1341619200,"07 7, 2012",2012,746,"['Python', 'probably', 'one', 'worst', 'attack', 'killer', 'snake', 'type', 'movies', 'ever', 'biggest', 'problem', 'had', 'hour', 'only', 'ONE', 'appearance', 'gigantic', 'king-size', 'snake', 'occurs', 'rest', 'time', 'occupied', 'crappy', 'irrelevant', 'dialogue', 'mainly', 'involving', 'pointless', 'chit', 'chat', 'members', 'police', 'department', 'When', 'say', 'pointless', 'really', 'mean', 'it-', 'wo', ""n't"", 'care', 'anything', 'have', 'say', '*all*', 'promise', 'least', 'last', '30', 'minutes', 'are', 'saved', 'thanks', 'killer', 'snake', 'slithering', 'underground', 'facility', 'chasing', 'teens', 'killing', 'one', 'one', 'reason', 'movie', '2', 'stars', 'Everything', 'else', 'movie', 'forgettable', 'boring', 'excessively', 'dialogue-heavy']",N/A

Of course, Anaconda remains the standard to which all such films must measure up to. It features Jon Voight, Ice Cube, and Jennifer Lopez. Python bills Casper Von Diem, Robert Englund, and Wil Wheaton as its stars. While these actors are not A-list, they are somewhat cult favorites. None of them, however, are the featured actor in the film. Somewhat of a disappointment.  This film does know what it is. It's a semi-parody and does have the necessary ridiculous elements to carry the concept. See it with a group of friends so that you can share the &quot;badness&quot;.

One being that Wil Wheaton was in it and the other being i love my monster movies.  This is exactly what one might expect.  Atrocious acting by a somewhat talented and recognizable cast,  TERRIBLE snake effects, but a satisfying amount of gore, and &quot;leave you hanging&quot; non-sex scenes.  All in all, it was a load of fun and it was great for late-night viewing.  I had a fun time with the over-the-top performances and seeing the results of the snake effects.  There was very little nudity but be warned:  Those expecting to see Jenny McCarthy in the buff will be sorely dissapointed.  My only complaint was that one character i liked got killed and Keith Coogan, (Brad from adventures in Babysitting and Cheetah) who is billed in the opening credits, doesn't show up until the end for one speaking part and it is after the snake &quot;problem&quot; has been resolved.

566063,A34IBXM7E8CPWE,B000053VC7,David Girod,"[8, 10]","Okay, I had just finished watching the awful dreck that was ""Night of the Komodo"", and decided I still needed more large reptile punishment...so I pop in ""Python"". ""Night of the Komodo"" had a no-name cast, lousy script, lousy special effects, and was a complete waste of time. The good news is ""Python"" had a couple B-level actors in the cast, and appears to have had some kind of budget...the bad news is, that it is as much a waste of time, and as hard to sit through as ""Night of the Komodo"" was. You may see Robert Englund's name on box, or hear about Jenny McCarthy's cameo and your interest might be piqued....squelch that interest right away, or you will be dooming yourself to a wasted evening of watching this film! The thing is..I love B movies, ""Tremors"" should have been nominated for an Academy Award it was so good. I am first in line whenever a new ""Friday the 13th"" or ""Halloween"" movie comes out. And I still think the original ""Pumpkinhead"" may be one of the most underrated movies of all time. Hell I even found something to love about Lou Diamond Phillips & ""Bats"". So I do know what I am talking about when it comes to B-movies. ""Python"" is just bad. I think the thing that killed this movie for me, was the half-hearted attempts at comic relief. If you are going to include comic relief make sure it's funny. The two dimwits working in the plating factory was just awful, then you had the goofy realtor trying to sell McCarthy a house.....just plain bad. To top it all off, you have Wil Wheaton sporting purple hair and body piercings? Having Wil Wheaton try to come off as a ""bad boy"" is like having Clint Howard pose as a male model..it just won't add up. Robert Englund must have been looking for a quick buck to appear in this, and he is completely wasted starring opposite the kid from Starship Troopers who sports a 70's porn-guy mustache that is very disturbing.

Directing--Very well done. Nice camera action from Richard Clabaugh. Good work!2.  Script--Nice writing and story from Chris Neal, Paul J.M. Bogh, and Gary Hershberger.3.  Acting--I thought it was really good. You have famous stars such as Robert Englund and Casper Van Dien. It also has Wil Wheaton, who was in the 1986 movie Stand By Me. My favorite actor in the movie was by far William Zabka. He's really good.Now for the content review.Rated R for violence and gore, some strong sexuality and language.1.  Sex/Nudity=7/10. There are two nudity scenes. One is like five minutes into the movie, so be warned.2.  Violence/Gore=6/10. Many people are killed and eaten by the snake throughout the movie and it can sometimes be bloody because the snake kills its victims with acid. There is also a memorable decapitation.3.  Language=6/10. Not a lot of language. 4 F-words and other profanities.Final thoughts...Overall 5/5. One of the best creature movies ever and it will always hold a special place in my movie-goer heart. It was one of the first movies I ever saw on the Syfy channel.

At times the production value, the acting, and the overall feel of the movie rivals that of some of the larger Hollywood award winners.  And at other times, the ridiculousness goes beyond anything I've ever seen.A Top Secret plane, which is one of the most obviously bad model planes ever put into a movie, is carrying some sort of massive crate.  When the crate begins to move, the doofus in back simply has to investigate.  Before you know it, he's impersonating a gerbil, the plane has a massive hole in its side, and a crash in the wilderness is inevitable.Fast-forward to two women getting it on during a camping excursion.  They both die cheesy, unseen deaths without achieving any sort of climax whatsoever.  Luckily their pet python escapes.Next up, a guy bike races through the streets, the parks, the back alleys, jumping and sliding over everything imaginable; there is no reason for this montage other than to introduce the credits.  After the BMX exhibition we find Johnny at a factory of some kind, where he's upset about his crappy job/legacy.  He leaves early and meets up with his friend Tommy (Wil Wheaton), who plays a punk rocker who's interested in nothing but money and Kenny the Closer, a prick real-estate agent whose attitude forces the viewer to follow the ""complete tool eventually dies a horrible death""-maxim of B-Horror movies.  In other words, there is more unnecessary leadup to the snake's next appearance.And then the local cops, one named John (William Zabka), and the other played by the guy under the stairs in People Under the Stairs, find one of the dead lovers from the tent.  The forensic pathologist on the case is that midget-looking guy Isaac from Children of the Corn.  Moments later Robert Englund is playing with a snake.  The next scene shows Jenny McCarthy with Kenny the Closer at an open house.  And then, BAM!, Casper Van Dien and his horrible accent are interviewing Robert Englund, who just happens to be a herbatologist.  There really is no purpose other than to show the complete lack of direction and coherence within the first hour of the movie, and to randomly introduce all the unrelated characters played by people who aren't quite stars.The rest follows the big snake horror movie formula: snake kills lots of people, many of the deaths are hilarious, good guys formulate stupid plan that eventually stops and/or kills snake.This has, without a doubt, some of the best Mystery Science Theatre possibilities in the history of cinema.  I laughed nearly the entire time, particularly at the preposterous ideas about the snake proposed by Englund's character (i.e. 129 ft. acid-spitting ATV, capable of speeds > 50mph, skin that can deflect an anti-tank round, and a voracious appetite for human flesh), and at Van Dien's hideous attempt at a foreign accent.",4,Snake on a plane,1206316800,"03 24, 2008",2008,2875,"[""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'movie', 'intended', 'be', 'campy', 'not', 'times', 'production', 'value', 'acting', 'overall', 'feel', 'movie', 'larger', 'Hollywood', 'award', 'winners', 'other', 'times', 'ridiculousness', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.A', 'Top', 'Secret', 'plane', 'one', 'most', 'obviously', 'bad', 'model', 'planes', 'ever', 'put', 'movie', 'carrying', 'sort', 'massive', 'crate', 'When', 'crate', 'move', 'doofus', 'back', 'simply', 'investigate', 'know', 'impersonating', 'gerbil', 'plane', 'massive', 'hole', 'side', 'crash', 'wilderness', 'inevitable.Fast-forward', 'two', 'women', 'getting', 'camping', 'excursion', 'die', 'cheesy', 'unseen', 'deaths', 'achieving', 'sort', 'climax', 'whatsoever', 'Luckily', 'pet', 'python', 'up', 'guy', 'bike', 'races', 'streets', 'parks', 'back', 'alleys', 'jumping', 'sliding', 'everything', 'imaginable', 'reason', 'montage', 'other', 'introduce', 'credits', 'BMX', 'exhibition', 'find', 'Johnny', 'factory', 'kind', 'where', 'upset', 'crappy', 'job/legacy', 'early', 'up', 'friend', 'Tommy', 'Wil', 'Wheaton', 'who', 'punk', 'rocker', 'who', 'interested', 'nothing', 'money', 'Kenny', 'Closer', 'prick', 'real-estate', 'agent', 'attitude', 'viewer', 'follow', 'complete', 'tool', 'eventually', 'horrible', 'death', '-maxim', 'B-Horror', 'movies', 'other', 'words', 'more', 'unnecessary', 'leadup', 'snake', 'next', 'appearance.And', 'then', 'local', 'cops', 'one', 'named', 'John', 'William', 'Zabka', 'other', 'played', 'guy', 'stairs', 'People', 'Stairs', 'find', 'one', 'dead', 'lovers', 'tent', 'forensic', 'pathologist', 'case', 'midget-looking', 'guy', 'Isaac', 'Children', 'Corn', 'Moments', 'later', 'Robert', 'Englund', 'playing', 'snake', 'next', 'scene', 'shows', 'Jenny', 'McCarthy', 'Kenny', 'Closer', 'open', 'house', 'then', 'BAM', 'Casper', 'Van', 'Dien', 'horrible', 'accent', 'are', 'interviewing', 'Robert', 'Englund', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'herbatologist', 'really', 'purpose', 'other', 'show', 'complete', 'lack', 'direction', 'coherence', 'first', 'hour', 'movie', 'randomly', 'introduce', 'unrelated', 'characters', 'played', 'people', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'stars.The', 'rest', 'big', 'snake', 'horror', 'movie', 'formula', 'snake', 'kills', 'lots', 'people', 'many', 'deaths', 'are', 'hilarious', 'good', 'guys', 'formulate', 'stupid', 'plan', 'eventually', 'and/or', 'kills', 'snake.This', 'doubt', 'best', 'Mystery', 'Science', 'Theatre', 'possibilities', 'history', 'cinema', 'laughed', 'nearly', 'entire', 'time', 'particularly', 'preposterous', 'ideas', 'snake', 'proposed', 'Englund', 'character', 'i.e', '129', 'ft.', 'acid-spitting', 'ATV', 'capable', 'speeds', '>', '50mph', 'skin', 'can', 'deflect', 'anti-tank', 'round', 'voracious', 'appetite', 'human', 'flesh', 'Van', 'Dien', 'hideous', 'attempt', 'foreign', 'accent']",N/A

This snake hears, can't see you if you stay still (obvious Jurassic Park idea ripped off), and can move at unbelievable speed. But then you have to wonder why a snake can chase down a speeding pickup truck, but can be outrun when you're riding a bicycle.Pretty interesting cast as well, you got Robert Englun (AKA Freddy Krueger as a mad doctor), the dude Johny from Starship Troopers, the bad kid from The Karate Kid, and the doctor's son from Star Trek TNG. So there are a lot of familiar faces in this flick.It's got some good action in it, and I espescially like the scenes that are just too ridiculous. They sort of remade the Psycho shower scene here. Of course true art is filming a young nude woman in the shower as you see a giant snake's head shadow falling onto the shower curtain.Campy? Yes. Waste of time?

Well I got those two, I just forgot that it should be dumb, lightweight, but also entertaining. I haven't looked at the credits too closely, but the movie is so wildly uneven it looks like about 10 different directors and editors slapped it together, none of them ever co-ordinating at all with the other, and that half of them were just maybe random people-no, children- they stopped on the street and handed a movie camera and asked them if they felt like taking over for a couple days, and the other half went out and spent all their paycheck on drugs. Actually I think both, the 10 different directors spent all their money on drugs, then handed the camera to some random kid on the street because they were too stoned to focus.A bad CGI python terrorizes a small town. that's about it. Not that this would be a problem, if the movie were entertaining. Anaconda had a pretty simple plot, and I liked it- it was trashy but at least fun, plus it had J.Lo and Ice Cube  kickin' a$$.  Python (bold choice for a title, guys!) makes Anaconda look like Goodfellas. Casper Van Dien and Robert Englund play two scientists who both spend their screen time trying to upstage the other.The CGI python doesn't seem very interested in eating people, either, just mangling them or spitting  venom on them. I guess it wasn't very hungry (though it does eat a shower curtain at one point) or just cranky. The only positive thing I can think of to say is at least this movie didn't try to pretend to be anything other than it was, and had a couple slightly amusing parts-well, maybe one. The scene with Jenny McCarthy made me realize why she doesn't get much acting work. Sorry, curse me out all you want, but you know I'm right.  Her and this actor who play a real estate salesman ham it up and overact so amazingly in their scenes that it was way past the point of being as amusing as they thought they were being.The constant patting-themselves-on-the-back smugness of ""hey, look how funny and noncomformist and wild we think we're being!'"" that the film oozes gets old within minutes and ruins any sort of fun you might have.They must have blown their whole budget on Englund and McCarthy, because as I said, the effects were terrible. The CGI itself was OK in parts, but then it would be really badly superimposed on what what obviously just the actors being filmed pretending to see a big snake. The lighting didn't even match. It looked like the snake was rearing up in front of a movie screen that needed cleaning.Anyway, this was just terrible and stupid in a bad way. I actually felt sorry for most of the actors. Even Caspar Van Dien looks embarassed, for God's sake. If you want a guilty pleasure, you can do soooo much better.

566088,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B000053VC7,Robert I. Hedges,"[2, 2]","As if ""Anaconda"" wasn't a bad enough giant snake movie, this faux-Anaconda proves that whenever you think it can't get any worse, you are probably mistaken. The film starts with a giant snake punching a hole in the side of a secret government plane and causing it to crash. The film then breaks our necks in a jump cut to the most annoying credits ever filmed featuring an amateur demonstrating skillful stunts on a bicycle. Sound exciting?The hero of the film is the cyclist who has a falling out with his brother over EPA standards for the chemical processing plant full of huge vats of acid they have inherited. There are subplots about camping holidays, annoying realtors, a crazed herpetologist (Robert Englund, who intermittently produces a small snake from his pocket and cuddles with it), and the State Department (of course). To add to the malaise there are moronic government agents (led by Casper Van Dien, who sports the worst accent in recent history), and an overly enthusiastic cop who makes Barney Fife look genuinely menacing.Along the way important lessons are learned: first, understand that squirting baby shampoo at a 130 foot long snake which shoots acid out of its mouth will not repel the snake, however, it may eat your shower curtain; and second, remember that when fleeing for your life on a bicycle from a huge snake capable of crawling at 50 miles per hour, it is important to stop to put on your bike helmet and sunglasses before starting to run from the rapidly encroaching menace. These are just two of the helpful pointers you will learn from ""Python"". The ending of the film is extremely predictable from the point where we learn that the protagonist co-owns an acid factory. I'll give you a clue, it involves the game of hide and seek, and the snake is ""it"".The film is about as lame as lame can get: I can't imagine what the sequel must be like. I can't say that I recommend this film exactly, but I will say that if you want a good laugh at the expense of a hapless CGI snake, this might be a good choice.",2,"""The Study Of How It Projects Its Corrosive Digestive Fluids Could Prove Invaluable.""",1207699200,"04 9, 2008",2008,2042,"['Anaconda', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'enough', 'giant', 'snake', 'movie', 'faux-Anaconda', 'whenever', 'think', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'worse', 'are', 'probably', 'mistaken', 'film', 'giant', 'snake', 'punching', 'hole', 'side', 'secret', 'government', 'plane', 'causing', 'crash', 'film', 'then', 'necks', 'jump', 'cut', 'most', 'annoying', 'credits', 'ever', 'filmed', 'featuring', 'amateur', 'demonstrating', 'skillful', 'stunts', 'bicycle', 'Sound', 'exciting', 'hero', 'film', 'cyclist', 'who', 'falling', 'out', 'brother', 'EPA', 'standards', 'chemical', 'processing', 'plant', 'full', 'huge', 'vats', 'acid', 'have', 'inherited', 'are', 'subplots', 'camping', 'holidays', 'annoying', 'realtors', 'crazed', 'herpetologist', 'Robert', 'Englund', 'who', 'intermittently', 'small', 'snake', 'pocket', 'cuddles', 'State', 'Department', 'course', 'add', 'malaise', 'are', 'moronic', 'government', 'agents', 'led', 'Casper', 'Van', 'Dien', 'who', 'sports', 'worst', 'accent', 'recent', 'history', 'overly', 'enthusiastic', 'cop', 'who', 'Barney', 'Fife', 'look', 'genuinely', 'way', 'important', 'lessons', 'are', 'learned', 'first', 'understand', 'squirting', 'baby', 'shampoo', '130', 'foot', 'long', 'snake', 'shoots', 'acid', 'mouth', 'will', 'not', 'repel', 'snake', 'however', 'may', 'eat', 'shower', 'curtain', 'second', 'remember', 'when', 'fleeing', 'life', 'bicycle', 'huge', 'snake', 'capable', 'crawling', '50', 'miles', 'hour', 'important', 'stop', 'put', 'bike', 'helmet', 'sunglasses', 'starting', 'run', 'rapidly', 'encroaching', 'menace', 'are', 'just', 'two', 'helpful', 'pointers', 'will', 'learn', 'Python', 'ending', 'film', 'extremely', 'predictable', 'point', 'where', 'learn', 'protagonist', 'co-owns', 'acid', 'factory', ""'ll"", 'give', 'clue', 'game', 'hide', 'seek', 'snake', '.The', 'film', 'as', 'lame', 'lame', 'can', 'get', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'what', 'sequel', 'must', 'be', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'recommend', 'film', 'exactly', 'will', 'say', 'want', 'good', 'laugh', 'expense', 'hapless', 'CGI', 'snake', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'choice']",N/A
