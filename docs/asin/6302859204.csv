It is with detachment and indifference that they examine their catches. We are abducted, restrained, examined, tagged, preserved, killed or simply released in our &quot;safe&quot; reality, depending on what they (the entities) feel might be useful for them. Like catching a fish, just for the pleasure of it, and then throwing the fish back in the water. Do we feel guilty in doing this ? It is very interesting to note that these aliens are quite similar to us: same anthropomorphic appearance and same cruelty but very scary face features. Demons. They might in fact be a mirror image of us. A manifestation of our deep subconscious nightmares, alternate life options born from the same collective unconscious.

340920,A1R8LZYZR3377O,6302859204,ajsteele,"[3, 3]","One of the best UFO movies ever done to this point. This film has scenes of true terror. The charactor of Travis is played near flawlessly by D.B. Sweeney. His alien abduction is unlike any other thats been put on film. Robert Patricks' role  as the concerned friend is a remarkably expressed down to Earth portrayal. James Garner plays an outstanding ultra suspicious investigator. The rural setting adds an understandable skepticism about the bizzare UFO story. The aliens look fakeish, but that doesn't take away from their cold, heartless actions and the otherworldly image they give off. With the same content this movie could easily have been a back shelf bomb. However, careful analysis of thoughts and ideas prevailed. It is based on a supposedly true story and handles it well. The movie also deals with friendship, and the layers it has. The film is different because it deals with two seperate issues:Whats happening on Earth/Whats happening with the abducted.

I must say, the movie was awesome.  Not only was the movie good and frightening alone,  but the taqline states &quot;based on the true story&quot;, suggesting the  possibilities that everything you will witness may have actually happened!  What truly gives the film it's meat is the sequence inside the alien  spacecraft.  Although the events inside the ship were changed from what the  real Travis Walton said had happened, the scene succeeded in as Travis put  it, &quot;conveying&quot; his feelings to the audience.  I could watch that  scene a million times, and still never be able to figure out how they did  it.  There were no fake CGI effects, and that honestly made it much more  realistic and believable.  &quot;Fire in the Sky&quot; is not a  masterpiece, but it was well done, and the alien sequence stands out as one  of the best pieces of film history!  I was a little disappointed with the  video though.  It's not letterboxed, and it's improperly framed.

340931,A2JJSCIGPZDWHI,6302859204,BENJAMIN MILER,"[0, 0]","Fire in the Sky was originally a book that was made in to a 1993 movie. I haven't read the book, but I am fully aware of Travis Walton thanks to Art Bell's radio program, documentaries like Overlords of the UFO and countless books on UFOs. I am really amazed at how historically accurate the movie is. The actors, though from 1993, look like they really came out of 1975, the clothing, the hairstyles, the vehicles they drove, the music they listened to. The movie does seem a bit inconsistent to what Travis Walton had actually said. For example, when he returned back five days later, the movie portrayed him as returning naked, when in reality he still had his clothes on. Some of the other content of the movie seemed to exist just to give viewers the creeps so it might be overexaggerated in places. One scene is where the aliens do a gruesome experiment on him by placing some sort of membrane-like blanket over him and his head while the aliens place weird goo in his mouth while using weird machines on him. From what I remember was Walton himself don't remember the aliens doing experiments on him. I guess some of the content of this movie existed for &quot;artistic liscence&quot; rather than being 100% factual. But whatever the case, this is the ultimate scary movie, and if you love this sort of stuff, don't forget to check out the movie adaptation of Whitley Strieber's Communion, that one too really gave me the creeps as well and had trouble sleeping the night I seen both movies.",4,Scary stuff,1001203200,"09 23, 2001",2001,1498,"['Fire', 'Sky', 'was', 'originally', 'book', 'was', 'made', '1993', 'movie', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'am', 'fully', 'aware', 'Travis', 'Walton', 'thanks', 'Art', 'Bell', 'radio', 'program', 'documentaries', 'Overlords', 'UFO', 'countless', 'books', 'UFOs', 'am', 'really', 'amazed', 'how', 'historically', 'accurate', 'movie', 'actors', '1993', 'look', 'really', 'came', '1975', 'clothing', 'hairstyles', 'vehicles', 'drove', 'music', 'listened', 'movie', 'seem', 'bit', 'inconsistent', 'what', 'Travis', 'Walton', 'had', 'actually', 'said', 'example', 'when', 'returned', 'back', 'five', 'days', 'later', 'movie', 'portrayed', 'returning', 'naked', 'when', 'reality', 'still', 'had', 'clothes', 'other', 'content', 'movie', 'seemed', 'exist', 'just', 'give', 'viewers', 'creeps', 'might', 'be', 'overexaggerated', 'places', 'One', 'scene', 'where', 'aliens', 'do', 'gruesome', 'experiment', 'placing', 'sort', 'membrane-like', 'blanket', 'head', 'aliens', 'place', 'weird', 'goo', 'mouth', 'using', 'weird', 'machines', 'what', 'remember', 'was', 'Walton', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'aliens', 'doing', 'experiments', 'guess', 'content', 'movie', 'existed', 'quot', 'artistic', 'liscence', 'quot', 'rather', 'being', '100', '%', 'factual', 'whatever', 'case', 'ultimate', 'scary', 'movie', 'love', 'sort', 'stuff', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'check', 'out', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'Whitley', 'Strieber', 'Communion', 'one', 'too', 'really', 'gave', 'creeps', 'as', 'well', 'had', 'trouble', 'sleeping', 'night', 'seen', 'movies']",N/A

I'm probably more impressed with each viewing.The story is presented very clearly and with no wasted time. A strong cast has been assembled: this is no ""B"" movie. Reportedly it has only made $20 million domestically since its 1993 release which is a shame. I can only assume it wasn't marketed well.I hadn't realized that one of the leads, Robert Patrick, had been T-1000 in Terminator 2 (in 1991). It is indeed hard to recognize him here from that earlier role. He's as convincing as possible as Mike, the best friend, of the abductee Travis. James Garner has a key role as an investigator. Henry Thomas, ""ET""'s Elliot and by this time a teenager, is one of the loggers who witnessed the UFO. I hadn't recognized him either until this viewing.The episode aboard the UFO, presented in flashbacks, was the work of ""Industrial Light and Magic"". It's eiree enough that, unlike Travis, you would think twice before stepping out to go up to a UFO.As in the book, a great deal of emphasis is placed on the polygraph tests. It's easy to accept the movie as entertainment: in the book Walton is insistent on the truth of what he experienced. But a polygraph, as I understand it, is not scientifically accepted as a reliable lie detector.Travis Walton participated in the movie production but accepted a completely different presentation of the abduction sequence than his book presents. His book's version, supposedly what really happened, would not have been as interesting. If you had been abducted, would you care that Hollywood used your story as input for a yarn that distorted what the aliens were like or would you want people to see what really happened. I wonder if many people who saw the movie didn't read the book and so came away not knowing how the aliens actually seemed to Travis.But Hollywood didn't need a true story, just a story that they could present as if true.Travis Walton has a web site which was operational at the time I am submitting this review.",5,"Exceptional direction, cast, and realism",1169251200,"01 20, 2007",2007,2022,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', '3', 'times', 'now', 'past', 'decade', ""'m"", 'probably', 'more', 'impressed', 'viewing.The', 'story', 'presented', 'very', 'clearly', 'wasted', 'time', 'strong', 'cast', 'been', 'assembled', 'B', 'movie', 'Reportedly', 'only', 'made', '20', 'million', 'domestically', '1993', 'release', 'shame', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'was', ""n't"", 'marketed', 'well.I', 'had', ""n't"", 'realized', 'one', 'leads', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'had', 'been', 'T-1000', 'Terminator', '2', '1991', 'indeed', 'hard', 'recognize', 'here', 'earlier', 'role', 'as', 'convincing', 'possible', 'Mike', 'best', 'friend', 'abductee', 'Travis', 'James', 'Garner', 'key', 'role', 'investigator', 'Henry', 'Thomas', 'ET', 'Elliot', 'time', 'teenager', 'one', 'loggers', 'who', 'witnessed', 'UFO', 'had', ""n't"", 'recognized', 'either', 'viewing.The', 'episode', 'UFO', 'presented', 'flashbacks', 'was', 'work', 'Industrial', 'Light', 'Magic', 'eiree', 'enough', 'Travis', 'would', 'think', 'twice', 'before', 'stepping', 'out', 'go', 'up', 'UFO.As', 'book', 'great', 'deal', 'emphasis', 'placed', 'polygraph', 'tests', 'easy', 'accept', 'movie', 'entertainment', 'book', 'Walton', 'insistent', 'truth', 'what', 'experienced', 'polygraph', 'understand', 'not', 'scientifically', 'accepted', 'reliable', 'lie', 'detector.Travis', 'Walton', 'participated', 'movie', 'production', 'accepted', 'completely', 'different', 'presentation', 'abduction', 'sequence', 'book', 'presents', 'book', 'version', 'supposedly', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'had', 'been', 'abducted', 'would', 'care', 'Hollywood', 'used', 'story', 'input', 'yarn', 'distorted', 'what', 'aliens', 'were', 'would', 'want', 'people', 'see', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'wonder', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'saw', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'so', 'came', 'away', 'not', 'knowing', 'how', 'aliens', 'actually', 'seemed', 'Travis.But', 'Hollywood', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'true', 'story', 'just', 'story', 'could', 'present', 'true.Travis', 'Walton', 'web', 'site', 'was', 'operational', 'time', 'am', 'submitting', 'review']",N/A

340939,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,6302859204,"Cloud ""...""","[7, 8]","I was roughly 9 or 10 when the film came out and quite frankly, it scared the hell out of me. Revisiting it several times since then, it's one of those kind of films where it holds up, even though my critical eye became keener. Back then, I wouldn't have cared about pacing or character development or anything: if it was good, then it was good. Does the film still entertain and at times, terrify? Sure, but maybe not as much as it used to. For new viewers though, you'd probably like it.Based on the controversial real-life story, a group of loggers see their friend, Travis Walton, encounter a UFO and find him missing. The story centers around the search for his body since everyone believes the loggers killed him and getting the full brunt of their cries is Mike Rogers, Travis' best friend. Travis is later found bloodied and bruised and seriously disturbed.Looking up the actual story on the net, you find evidence that it was either all a big hoax or X-Files-like cover up. Watching the film though, you tend to believe it and wonder whether it really happened or if it was something else. Luckily the film doesn't say one way or the other that it really did or not. You have scenes that strongly suggest it did while you have everyone saying it was all a big lie but it's ultimately up to you whether you want to believe it but it sure makes you want to believe it.The acting mainly falls on the shoulders of Robert Patrick and D.B Sweeney as Mike and Travis. Largely known as T-1000 from Terminator 2, it's surprising by just how effective Patrick can be. And although absent for a good chunk of the film, D.B certainly makes an impression in his limited screen time. The rest of the actors are admirable in their roles but they don't really require much else to do which is fine. Craig Sheffer plays the attitude man, Allan Dallis while James Garner plays the investigator sent to solve the case. He essentially plays the one emotion: that he's right, no such thing as UFO's and even when Travis returns and tells the story, it's like ""he's lying too!"" While that's what he's supposed to play, he does come off as irritating as if himself getting abducted would warrant a disbelieving emotion.The film arguably succeeds in its beginning and ending: a little bit into the film we get a dramatized account of Travis getting abducted and it's every bit as unsettling as it should be, letting sound design take over and creep in. But definately the highlight, not only in this film but probably in sci-fi films, is Travis' experience on the mothership. Sure the idea might sound hokey: Travis on a ship flying around with aliens inside but it's creepy, unsettling and it's one of the more effective scenes I've seen. It's also ironic that what starts the scene is some kind of syrup which I find funny looking back but the scene works so you kind of forget it all started with Aunt Jemima.If there's a DVD that needs special features it's this one. This is literally first generation DVD stuff with not even a theatrical trailer or anything. Commentaries, behind the scenes, documentaries, featurettes: zip. But I'm assuming it's going to be similar to Deep Impact's special edition: one commentary and about 5 featurettes lasting 10 minutes and that's it.

Riding the leading edge of the &quot;extraterrestrial&quot; wave of the  mid-1990s, &quot;FITS&quot; dramatizes the story of logger Travis Walton, who claims to have been abducted by aliens in rural mountain country. Let's give him the benefit of the doubt.*SPOILER ALERT*Now, most movies of this sort tend to dance around the aliens' purpose--which makes sense, since nobody actually KNOWS the aliens' purpose. What sets &quot;FITS&quot; apart is its flat-out depiction of what the visitors are after: they eat people. Travis is cocooned in a honeycomb (not the cereal) style cell, but wakes up and frees himself. He discovers the half-consumed corpse of a fellow abductee, and freaks out. He is then re-captured by the aliens and probed. That seems like an odd progression of events, but hey--they're aliens.Of course, Travis escaped this ordeal so he could tell the story--which means we get to see some of the fallout when he tries to re-acclimate himself to non-probing, human society (I'd imagine his next trip to the proctologist would ignite an intergalatic version of a Vietnam flashback). As one would imagine, the trauma played havoc with his personal and professional lives; nobody wants to hire a logger with a history of alien-abduction. Interestingly, the film stops short of showing how Travis' life was improved by selling the major-motion-picture rights to his story.D.B. Sweeney (&quot;the Maestro&quot;), Robert Patrick, and James Garner all contribute salt-of-the-Earth performances, and what special effects there are do a decent job of making the movie kind of spooky.

The script, from Star Trek's Tracy Torm&eacute; is intelligent and subtle, spending time developing the characters, as well as exploring what the spaceship might have looked like. The special effects aren't that special, and the alien creatures (admittedly in Travis's head) are almost literal copies of those used in Close Encounters Of The Third Kind.James Garner is under-used although he acquits himself well, and Robert Patrick is not charismatic enough to hold a lead role (Although the X-Files may yet prove me wrong).

I should try to see if the movie stands on it's own.  With fiction, this is easier.  With supposed true stories, I have a bigger problem.Yes, the movie strays big time when it comes to the part we really want to see, which is what Travis Walton claims to have seen in the spaceship.  The movie completely ignores that he claims to have seen human-looking creatures as well as aliens.  Why this wasn't even tried to be portrayed, I have not idea.  So if I'm seeing this big omission as something to be critical about, yes, I'm disappointed.But what if I didn't know the ""actual"" story?  How does the film stack up on it's own.  Well, first, they spend way too much time setting up for the ""good"" parts.  We didn't really need to see that Travis is somewhat of a free spirit.  We don't need to see how he wants to marry his boss's sister.  And we don't need to know the chemistry of the crew he works on.What we do need to see is more time inside the spaceship.  I don't know if the movie had budget problems, but once they constructed the set, why not use it more.  And yes, throw in the human-looking creatures. And spend more time with the adventures AFTER the incident, instead of too much before it.That aside, it's not that bad a movie.  We do care about the characters, and the D.B. Sweeney portray of Travis does show fear well, both as the incidents happen, as well as the aftermath.  It also shows a good performance by a pre-""Terminator 2"" and pre-""X-files"" Robert Patrick.

This film has just become one of my all time favorites!  If you like ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and ""Alien"", then this is definitely for you.  It has one twist though---it is based on a true story of an alien abduction that happened on November 5, 1975.  A group of loggers headed by Mike (Robert Patrick), were working on a government contract clearing out part of the forest in the White Mountains (near Snowflake, Arizona).  They had to finish the job within a short time, so they worked into the night.  While returning to their small town, the 6 men saw a ""fire in the sky"".  They thought it maybe a forest fire and realized that the road they were on was the only one in or out of the forest.  Mike pulled the truck over to get a better look.  Travis (D.B. Sweeney), got out of the truck and ran to the ""fire"" despite the other guys trying to persuade him to stay in the truck.  It turned out to be this incredibly large UFO.  Travis was looking at it while the other guys are just screaming at him to get back in the truck.  The UFO ""zaps"" him and they figured he was dead.  Mike returned a short time later to look for his body, but didn't find one.  They told their story to the local police and an investigator (James Garner).  The remaining 5 guys were being interviewed on a murder charge, as no everyone believed their story.  They all agreed to take a lie detector test which they all passed.  Travis returned five days later without having any food or water and was severely dehydrated and was taken to the hospital.  The last part of the movie, deals with his ordeal of being kidnapped, taken away and having medical experiments done to him by aliens.  This movie kept me on edge the entire time!  I NEVER was bored!  The last 10 minutes of this movie terrified me more than any horror film I ever saw.  It is the best thrill ride you could ever be on, at the expense of Travis Walton.

Is it true?  I have an open mind, and this movie never tries to convince you, it just goes about its business of showing the turmoil and disbelief that shrouded the other loggers who witnessed the alien invasion, but not the actual abduction.While D.B. Sweeney who plays Travis gets top billing, the movie really focuses on his friends, mainly Robert Patrick as his best friend who finds himself ostracized by family and friends, and even accused of murdering the missing Travis.  Sweeney and Patrick are both quite good in their roles.  The friends are well embodied by Peter Berg, Bradley Gregg, and Craig Sheffer.  James Garner is his reliable old self as the state investigator who never believes the abduction story.What really keeps this from being an exceptional movie is the slow pacing and unimaginative direction.

Rational people say there is no such thing and those who say they have been kidnapped just want attention.  Yet, it endures.  As a person who does, repeat DOES, believe in intelligent life on other planets and that UFOs are coming to Earth for some reason or another, this is quite a story.In 1975, Travis Garner was just an average guy living in Snowflake, AZ as a logger.  He and four friends were hired to clear a forest space for a developer, when one night something very strange happens.  While crammed in a car together, they see a light coming from above.  Travis gets out of the car to get a closer look, then is struck down by a beam of light.  Out of fear, the four others speed away.  They go back to get him, and Travis is gone.  What happened?  When they return to town, they say to others ""They took him"".  What?  The something they saw in the sky took him.  Town police began to suspect something else, as this sounded like a murder they were trying to cover up.  They take lie detector tests, not all of them passed.  There is something strange going on here.  Then, five days later, Travis calls his friend Grant begging for help.  Grant find him in a public restroom, shivering, naked and afraid.  Travis had been kidnapped by a UFO and they brought him back.  He tells his tale through flashbacks and hypnosis sessions with a therapist, also having some horrifying nightmares.What happened to Travis that night and why did he turn up five days later?  There are no other rational explinations except that he was, in fact, kidnapped by a UFO.  These creatures are real, they are doing things to us.  As to why, there are no answers.  This movie, however, was not marketed very well and only made a modest profit at the box office.  And, let's face it, it was pretty funny that they put Henry Thomas in it.

It was very well done and should be on DVD.In its day, this movie about an alien abduction experience, was something of a shocker. In a nutshell, a group of young men working as lumberjacks drive home one evening only to be stopped in their tracks by a glowing object in the sky. They get out of their vehicle, Travis Walton gets beamed up, the rest flee. Back in the town, and without Travis, they have to explain his disappearance. People start suspecting that one of them killed Travis and so a missing persons/possible homicide investigation gets underway.

340999,A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ,6302859204,Robert Blake,"[1, 1]","The Travis Walton case remains one of he most popular in the folklore of alien abduction stories. I think the mere fact a movie was actually produced about it proves it's resonance. But, alas, the movie almost works if not for two main problems: It has too much of a vague, quick pace and it is not even accurate as according to Walton's description of the abduction experience in the book. The movie as a movie isn't too bad, there's some good acting, and some story elements which might seem clich&eacute; don't seem too out of place here. The best scenes involve the encounter with the UFO and the frightening experience within. These are, one must admit, some of the most realistic scenes of supposed alien abduction ever made. They are indeed intense and scary, making one wish he/she never gets abducted by aliens (even if you don't believe in them). However, the fault for someone who already is familiar with the Walton case is that these scenes both disappoint and effect. They affect because they are realistic, but they disappoint because they never resemble for a second what Walton describes in his book. In it he writes about the aliens looking like humans and giving him a tour of the ship etc. etc., pretty nice and hospitable extraterrestrials, but in the film they are small, hairless beings who treat Walton like helpless cattle and force him to go through a horrible exeprience involving medical experiments. What's the deal? Does the movie want to entertain us or make us believe? The movie as a whole successes in keeping the viewer wondering, especially in the scenes where Walton is still missing and everyone theorizes where he has gone. The ending is too quick and answers nothing, a few more minutes and we might have at least gotten information on Walton writing the book and going back to a normal workday.

341000,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,6302859204,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[2, 4]","Caveat - I never studied the case upon which this flick was allegedly based, aside from seeing an entry about it in a copy of ""Ripley's Believe it or not!"", so I can't comment on its accuracy.  However, this flick grabbed me nonetheless.  DB Sweeny is Walton, a starry eyed dreamer in what looks like the woods of wild America.  He suffers a strange relationship with those he considers his friends, so that when he ""disappears"", they are suspected of murder.  Travis's friends are implicated in his disappearance, and begin to wonder whether, despite their certainty in their story, whether they might somehow be guilty for his loss.  Instead, Travis reappears with no concious memory of the lost time.  He undergoes hypnosis and recalls a traumatic sojourn aboard an alien craft.  At this point, the flick is forced to leave the promising plot-line that pitted Travis with his friends with that of whether his illusions are genuine memories (the film presents them so lucidly, it's impossible to believe the film disbelieves them).  ""Fire"" bravely plays up the alien menace of these abducting aliens - eschewing the stereotype of abduction as an enlightening evolution.  Instead of an intergalactic peace corps, these guys look like CIA freelancers.  The interiors of the ship look more like they were inspired by the darkness of the 90's than the bright and optimistic 70's that gave us the abduction craze to begin with.  DB Sweeny and Rob Patrick give effective performances in a story that measures its thin supply of shocks.

Whether or not you believe the story being told, it still made for an entertaining movie.  And admittedly, having the ""Based On A True Story"" line attached does tend to add a bit more creepiness to an often told Hollywood tale.I remember this being marketed more as a science fiction film, but other than the premise and the sequence near the end of the film that shows Walton's experience aboard the ship, this is really more of a mystery/drama.The film tells the tale of Travis Walton and his logger buddies who witness a UFO in the mountains one night in 1975 while driving back to town.  Travis leaves the truck, is shot by a light from the ship and disappears.  His buddies return to town to tell the story, but soon find themselves suspects in Walton's disappearance.  But no matter how hard they try to convince friends, family and law officials of what they saw, they find the town turning against them and the whole thing turning into a media circus that nearly ruins their lives.  When Travis is found alive five days later, it opens a whole new can of worms.  Now no one is suspected of murder, but are now accused of trying to pull a huge hoax(ya just can't win when you get abducted, can ya?).It's a fascinating movie that could have come off as corny, but ends up being rather effective.  Good performances all around by a cast of mostly character and lesser known actors including Peter Berg(writer/director of Very Bad Things and star of Wes Craven's Shocker), Craig Sheffer(Nightbreed), Henry Thomas(E.T of course!!), D.B. Sweeney(The Cutting Edge and Spawn) and Robert Patrick(everyone's favorite liquid metal robot assassin).  Sweeney may be the figure which the film revolves around, but a good chunk of the film belongs to Robert Patrick, who does a damn good job in a dramatic role.  Sweeney does a fantastic job of showing sheer terror in the spacecraft scenes, as well as his post-traumatic state.  I've always felt that both Sweeney and Patrick are  horribly underused actors.  The star power here is James Garner as the detective working on the case.  He doesn't believe a damn word of their story-even when a polygraph test shows they are all telling the truth-and is hellbent on discrediting and exposing them as fakes.The alien sequence at the end of the film is very effective and creepy.  This sequence could have sunk the movie if handled wrong, but thankfully it works damn well.  Granted it's been Hollywood-ized and differs from Walton's actual account of what happened to him, but movies have to be sensationalized, right?If you didn't catch this one the first time around(I don't remember it making a huge splash at the box office), I'd highly suggest seeing it.  Hell, I'd highly suggest seeing it even if you have seen it before.  It just might make a believer out of ya.",4,Who Woulda Thunk?

341009,A1VH6QWC6JZRAC,6302859204,The Guardian,"[17, 17]","The 1975 UFO-abduction of Travis Walton near Snowflafe Arizona is probably the most convincing such case on record. It was multiply witnessed; Travis (the abductee) was missing for five days and nights to be returned traumatised and dehydrated; extensive investigation including polygraph testing of all the witnesses only strengthened the reality of the case, and not one of the witnesses has changed a single detail of his testimony after 35 years. Anomalies in tree growth compatible with high radiation exposure have been identified in subsequent years in the precise location where the encounter with the UFO reportedly took place, so despite being outside our normal paradigms of consensus reality, it looks like it really happened.Tracy Torme's 1993 film is a thoughtful piece of work which conveys the essential elements of the story and is largely faithful to the real-life narrative. D. B. Sweeney as Travis and Robert Patrick as Mike Rogers are particularly outstanding in an excellent cast. All the cast and crew became convinced by the story during the shoot. A town in Oregon substituted for Snowflake in the film.The film begins on the morning of 5 November 1975, a normal day for the young loggers engaged in their tree-thinning contract. The encounter takes place as the seven loggers make their journey home down a mountain road in Mike Rogers' pick-up truck in the early evening, shown from the perspective of the six witnesses as Travis is knocked off his feet by a beam from the hovering UFO. The subsequent difficulties experienced by members of the crew during the five days Travis was missing is well realised, as they deal with accusations and incredulity from the wider community and suspicion from the local police authorities. Then Travis is returned, confused and traumatised, the story attracts the international media and things get even worse for all involved. The film has a good script, dramatic tension, is convincingly acted, well edited and rewards occasional repeat viewings.In his literary and informative book of the same name, Travis describes the making of the film and his involvement with it. He explains the reasons why the abduction scene aboard the UFO and the appearance of the aliens in the film differ from his real-life recollection; why these changes were made to enhance the drama and to communicate the horror and strangeness to the audience. He also felt D.B. Sweeney was well cast, shared his attitude to life and had a similar general character, and was pleased with his portrayal in the film. I really recommend reading the book to anyone interested in the story. Travis is a good writer and discusses many things including his own life prior to the abduction and some of the far-reaching philosophical implications of non-human extraterrestrial life, particularly as it seems to be visiting us here.I met Travis in Snowflake AZ in May 2010 and found him to be as genuine, straightforward and principled as everyone who meets him describes him to be. He wishes he'd stayed in the truck with the others, and would have preferred had the incident happened to somebody else. The international exposure has been so unwelcome that for years he didn't even have a phone and shunned virtually all media contact. He and Dana (who have been happily married all these years) have four children and eight grandchildren, and almost never discuss the incident within the family or with neighbors. They still live in Snowflake, as quiet a middle-American town as you could imagine, where on a weekday everything seems to close at 9pm. He is a man of few words but those he does speak are well-chosen. He radiates integrity and has a terrific dry sense of humor.It's a pity Torme's film generated only US$20 million in 15 years, but nevertheless it was a modest commercial success. It's good, has stood the test of time well, and deserves a bigger audience.",4,"Fire in the Sky, thought-provoking stuff on film",1279238400,"07 16, 2010",2010,3900,"['1975', 'UFO-abduction', 'Travis', 'Walton', 'Snowflafe', 'Arizona', 'probably', 'most', 'convincing', 'such', 'case', 'record', 'was', 'multiply', 'witnessed', 'Travis', 'abductee', 'was', 'missing', 'five', 'days', 'nights', 'be', 'returned', 'traumatised', 'dehydrated', 'extensive', 'investigation', 'including', 'polygraph', 'testing', 'witnesses', 'only', 'strengthened', 'reality', 'case', 'not', 'one', 'witnesses', 'changed', 'single', 'detail', 'testimony', '35', 'years', 'Anomalies', 'tree', 'growth', 'compatible', 'high', 'radiation', 'exposure', 'have', 'been', 'identified', 'subsequent', 'years', 'precise', 'location', 'where', 'encounter', 'UFO', 'reportedly', 'took', 'place', 'so', 'being', 'outside', 'normal', 'paradigms', 'consensus', 'reality', 'really', 'Torme', '1993', 'film', 'thoughtful', 'piece', 'work', 'essential', 'elements', 'story', 'largely', 'faithful', 'real-life', 'narrative', 'D.', 'B.', 'Sweeney', 'Travis', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'Mike', 'Rogers', 'are', 'particularly', 'outstanding', 'excellent', 'cast', 'cast', 'crew', 'became', 'convinced', 'story', 'shoot', 'town', 'Oregon', 'substituted', 'Snowflake', 'film.The', 'film', 'morning', '5', 'November', '1975', 'normal', 'day', 'young', 'loggers', 'engaged', 'tree-thinning', 'contract', 'encounter', 'place', 'seven', 'loggers', 'make', 'journey', 'home', 'down', 'mountain', 'road', 'Mike', 'Rogers', 'pick-up', 'truck', 'early', 'evening', 'shown', 'perspective', 'six', 'witnesses', 'Travis', 'knocked', 'off', 'feet', 'beam', 'hovering', 'UFO', 'subsequent', 'difficulties', 'experienced', 'members', 'crew', 'five', 'days', 'Travis', 'was', 'missing', 'well', 'realised', 'deal', 'accusations', 'incredulity', 'wider', 'community', 'suspicion', 'local', 'police', 'authorities', 'Then', 'Travis', 'returned', 'confused', 'traumatised', 'story', 'international', 'media', 'things', 'get', 'even', 'worse', 'involved', 'film', 'good', 'script', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'convincingly', 'acted', 'well', 'edited', 'rewards', 'occasional', 'repeat', 'viewings.In', 'literary', 'informative', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'Travis', 'making', 'film', 'involvement', 'reasons', 'why', 'abduction', 'scene', 'UFO', 'appearance', 'aliens', 'film', 'differ', 'real-life', 'recollection', 'why', 'changes', 'were', 'made', 'enhance', 'drama', 'communicate', 'horror', 'strangeness', 'audience', 'also', 'felt', 'D.B', 'Sweeney', 'was', 'well', 'cast', 'shared', 'attitude', 'life', 'had', 'similar', 'general', 'character', 'was', 'pleased', 'portrayal', 'film', 'really', 'recommend', 'reading', 'book', 'anyone', 'interested', 'story', 'Travis', 'good', 'writer', 'many', 'things', 'including', 'own', 'life', 'prior', 'abduction', 'far-reaching', 'philosophical', 'implications', 'non-human', 'extraterrestrial', 'life', 'particularly', 'be', 'visiting', 'here.I', 'met', 'Travis', 'Snowflake', 'AZ', 'May', '2010', 'found', 'be', 'genuine', 'straightforward', 'principled', 'everyone', 'who', 'be', ""'d"", 'stayed', 'truck', 'others', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'had', 'incident', 'happened', 'somebody', 'else', 'international', 'exposure', 'been', 'so', 'unwelcome', 'years', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'phone', 'shunned', 'virtually', 'media', 'contact', 'Dana', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'happily', 'married', 'years', 'have', 'four', 'children', 'eight', 'grandchildren', 'almost', 'never', 'discuss', 'incident', 'family', 'neighbors', 'still', 'live', 'Snowflake', 'quiet', 'middle-American', 'town', 'could', 'imagine', 'where', 'weekday', 'everything', 'close', '9pm', 'man', 'few', 'words', 'speak', 'are', 'well-chosen', 'integrity', 'terrific', 'dry', 'sense', 'humor.It', 'pity', 'Torme', 'film', 'generated', 'only', 'US', '20', 'million', '15', 'years', 'was', 'modest', 'commercial', 'success', 'good', 'stood', 'test', 'time', 'well', 'bigger', 'audience']",N/A
