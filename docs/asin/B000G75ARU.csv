Her on the show was some of it's more entertaining points. That is if you ignore her horrible exit from the show. She blows right of the roof and flies right through a shoe store window. Some how the show still had some life left in it after though and it still survived for a year and a half later. If it was gonna get canceled though that was the best time to do it and not by leaving us on the edge of ours seats with a To Be Continued!Anyway, after Monice died tragically stupid, she's replaced as the new owner by Dean Cain who plays Sam's ex-husband. He's some-what annoying and no where near as entertaining as Lara Flynn Boyle was. While it also bugged me that there's no mention of Nessa after awhile. After she leaves to go see her sister along with Delinda in the 2nd season finale, it's left off with someone after her. They never got into what happened next. In the beginning of season 3, Ed's just seen looking at a picture of her and Mike's talking about how he had a chance with her.

It's not great art and all the plots aren't fully realistic, but it's just meant to be a fun and entertaining series which it is.Seasons one and two were extraordinary. I have a couple of quibbles with all the celebrity guests who show up just to show up, but that was a minor nit and I really liked almost every single episode of those seasons. Season three, just somehow seems to have lost something to the formula. It's really hard for me to explain, but it's just sort of like all the characters don't quite fit into the same overall plot for an episode sometimes. Just somehow the cohesion isn't quite right at times. That's not to say the episodes are still enjoyable, it just seems at times they try to get to many different plots at the same time and had to give short shrift to a few.For anyone who's not really familiar with the show, you should really start with seasons one and/or two or you are probably going to be lost. The basic plot is that it's a casino in Las Vegas it's run by the characters shown on the box as department heads. The casinos brought under new management and they have to deal with that for most of the first half. Then they have some other issues in the second half of the season but I can't get into without spoiling it. Picture sort of a drama/comedy/detective show set in a casino where any number of crazy people and visiting. Don't think too hard and you'll have a lot of fun.I would still suggest this season to anybody who's a fan of the show.
