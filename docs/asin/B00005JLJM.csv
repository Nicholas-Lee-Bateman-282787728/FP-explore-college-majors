601591,A3DGB4HN3QCGAL,B00005JLJM,A. Burchfield,"[1, 2]","If you're on a limited budget the first season of Dark Angel is the one to get because the writing and plots are so much better. Set about 15 years from now in Seattle the series centers around an escaped (from a secret government lab)genetically modified young woman,Max,played by Jessica Alba. The U.S. and  much (maybe all of it) of the world economy have collapsed because some never defined enemy fried all of the U.S. East Coast Computers with an Electromagnetic Pulse bomb. The country has become a police state and the series has Max and her friends just trying to get by. Many times Max does work for an underground crusader helping people get to freedom or sometimes just getting back at the bad guys.A nice touch was the sub theme through some episodes of Max and the other escapees being designed to need supplements of tryptophan. Max went through seizures a few times because she ran out of it, One episode had her friend Cindi thinking she was an addict and later learning the truth about what Max really was.",4,"Very inventive, too bad they had to mess it up.",1075248000,"01 28, 2004",2004,1024,"[""'re"", 'limited', 'budget', 'first', 'season', 'Dark', 'Angel', 'one', 'get', 'writing', 'plots', 'are', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'Set', '15', 'years', 'now', 'Seattle', 'series', 'centers', 'escaped', 'secret', 'government', 'lab', 'genetically', 'modified', 'young', 'woman', 'Max', 'played', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'U.S.', 'much', 'maybe', 'world', 'economy', 'have', 'collapsed', 'never', 'defined', 'enemy', 'fried', 'U.S.', 'East', 'Coast', 'Computers', 'Electromagnetic', 'Pulse', 'bomb', 'country', 'become', 'police', 'state', 'series', 'Max', 'friends', 'just', 'trying', 'get', 'Many', 'times', 'Max', 'work', 'underground', 'crusader', 'helping', 'people', 'get', 'freedom', 'sometimes', 'just', 'getting', 'back', 'bad', 'guys.A', 'nice', 'touch', 'was', 'sub', 'theme', 'episodes', 'Max', 'other', 'escapees', 'being', 'designed', 'need', 'supplements', 'tryptophan', 'Max', 'went', 'seizures', 'few', 'times', 'ran', 'One', 'episode', 'had', 'friend', 'Cindi', 'thinking', 'was', 'addict', 'later', 'learning', 'truth', 'what', 'Max', 'really', 'was']",N/A

601593,A28MYC8KKCK2FZ,B00005JLJM,Alice L. Moore,"[6, 6]","This ""Dark Angel"" DVD set was part of an excellent twofer bargain with ""Dark Shadows""Dark Shadows The Revival - The Complete Series.  The complete set was 19.99 at Target.The show had an intriguing premise.  A product of genetic engineering, Max, is on the run from the government.  She and eleven others escaped when they were children.  All were separated and either are dead or in hiding, like Max(Jessica Alba).  The plot thread that runs through this series is seeking out those others and avoiding the government at the same time.  Another interesting twist is that she must make a living and interact with others.  She also does a Good Deed of the Week; hence the title.The show is set in 2019.  The US is recovering from an ElectroMagnetic Pulse.  It fried the USA  to third world status.  This seems to make it easier for Max to avoid the Feds.One of the problems I have with the show; it is not dystopic enough.  Everyone seems to have the living standard of a 20 year old college student with a part time job.  There are no public health problems,  girls can get their hair done and everyone seems to have a mountain bike.  Max seems sane and good looking even though animal DNA was used in her conception. Her virtue seems to come without effort.  When compared to ""Firefly""Firefly - The Complete Seriesit seems too good to be true for someone with such a harsh early life.  The character of River Tam is much more likely  than supergirl Max in those circumstances.  I had trouble suspending disbelief because, I had seen ""FireFly"" before this series.The positive points of this series was the character development of Max, the Computer Guy and Reagan Ronald, her employer.  His Ponies on their bikes seem to better than the US Postal Service.  My two sons, 23 and 26, liked Jessica Alba.

It was set in Seattle in the not distant future where terrorists had set off an electromagnetic device in the atmosphere which had caused computers in the US to lose all their data (turn all those 1's to 0's).  In effect, it turned the US into a 3rd world country overnight.Prior to the 'pulse' as it was called, the government had been experimenting with genetic engineering, & had created supersoldiers, a group of which had managed to escape as children.  One of these is Max, & it is she that our story is about.This first series I really enjoyed.  It's definitely sci-fi, but it retains a thread of realism - you find yourself thinking that governments would indeed do all this stuff, & it's technology is on par with what's available, so it doesn't seem outside the realms of posibility.  It was made prior to 9/11, so the premise of the pulse doesn't seem impossible as it once did either (although I couldn't say whether it would be scientifically possible).All in all, I thought it was innovative & entertaining, & it's great to see a woman in an action hero role!",5,Truly different!,1069891200,"11 27, 2003",2003,1107,"['Dark', 'Angel', 'was', 'original', 'show', 'was', 'set', 'Seattle', 'not', 'distant', 'future', 'where', 'terrorists', 'had', 'set', 'off', 'electromagnetic', 'device', 'atmosphere', 'had', 'caused', 'computers', 'US', 'lose', 'data', 'turn', '1', '0', 'effect', 'turned', 'US', '3rd', 'world', 'country', ""'pulse"", 'was', 'called', 'government', 'had', 'been', 'experimenting', 'genetic', 'engineering', 'had', 'created', 'supersoldiers', 'group', 'had', 'managed', 'escape', 'children', 'One', 'Max', 'story', 'about.This', 'first', 'series', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'definitely', 'sci-fi', 'thread', 'realism', 'find', 'thinking', 'governments', 'would', 'indeed', 'do', 'stuff', 'technology', 'par', 'what', 'available', ""n't"", 'seem', 'realms', 'posibility', 'was', 'made', 'prior', '9/11', 'premise', 'pulse', ""n't"", 'seem', 'impossible', 'once', 'did', 'could', ""n't"", 'say', 'would', 'be', 'scientifically', 'possible', '.All', 'thought', 'was', 'innovative', 'entertaining', 'great', 'see', 'woman', 'action', 'hero', 'role']",N/A

Dark Angel is now one of my favorite shows of all time, ranked alongside Alias and Firefly, to both of which it bears some resemblance, to the first in a delicately-handled and completely riveting love story and to the second in a certain touch of kick-butt wildness and a wholly original world, except that in the case of Dark Angel it's more of a punk world than the cowboy one of Firefly. Jessica Alba glows in one of her first roles as gorgeous, genetically altered, surprisingly vulnerable super-woman with an attitude Max, living the life of a poor, street-smart mail-carrier in a post-techno-apocalypse world. While Michael Weatherly is her perfect counterpart as the idealistic, wealthy former journalist now acting as an underground resistance leader striving for justice. The storyline involving Max's mail-carrying friends is one of the few major weaknesses in a very original and riveting series. Don't miss out on this one. It's worth it.

But it turned out to be a great dissppointment.The premise is actually interesting if not terribly original.  The US is now a third world country, a bomb set off above ground sent off an emp wave that erased most electronically stored information.  The government got desperate and started pushing expermintal techniques.  One of which was a super soldier program that used gene therapy to create a perfect solider.  But many of them escaped and due to their enhanced abilities manage to stay hidden.  The story is of one named Alex, who ended up in Seattle and is still looking for the othe escaped super soldiers.The good.  The plot isn't terribly original but it works.  The filming had a grittier quality to it than normal.  Some of the characters are interesting, i.e. the rich boy that runs a pirate news byte exposing corruption.The bad.  A lot unfortunately.  The writing is terrible.  Most of the side characters are annoying.  Original Cindy usually made me cringe, either the fact that she is a desperate attempt to be pc(self sufficient, black, lesbian), or her dialogue where she mainly refers to herself in third person.  Or the rest of the bike messangers who are dopey cliches that never rise beyond two dimensions.  The grunge look is overdone and the overusage of street lingo was unnerving.I was suprised that this show lasted to even a second season.  I am guessing it was James Camerons name that drove it.Though the premise is intersting, it lacks depth or quality in the writing or acting.

About 2/3 of the way through the First season, I was sort of disappointed. The show was sort of slow out of the gate. It wasn't really growing at all. It was sort of soap-operishly batting around the same storylines.But then, maybe the last 3 episodes of Season 1 were a different story, and most noteably, the season 1 FINALE was an absolute smashing homerun!!

I had only seen the show once or twice before, and since I had no background on the story/characters I was a bit lost. I was willing to take a chance, however, just to watch the sultry Jessica Alba in action! Upon watching the first few episodes, I realized that it's actually an excellent show! I really like the characters; they are interesting and likeable for the most part. (Or interesting and unlikeable in the case of the baddies!) Some people have complained about Jessica's acting, but I feel she portrayed the role of a genetically enhanced hybrid kick-ass female perfectly! I also discovered that Michael Weatherly is a great actor, and found his character very agreeable.

601607,A2JLSHTST2SP1I,B00005JLJM,Danno,"[13, 17]","'Dark Angel' is a FOX series that never gathered more than a cult following, yet ages very well and plays much better on DVD than it ever did on TV. 'Dark Angel' details the partnership between a genetically enhanced warrior on the lam and a partially handicapped vigillante who uses his computer rather than a gun as a weapon. It's worth your while for three very good reasons. First, there's Jessica Alba, who plays the heroine Max. 'Dark Angel' perfectly matches Alba's strengths and weaknesses as an actress and - unlike most of Alba's movie roles - makes her look exceptionally confident and skilled. Watching 'Dark Angel,' it's easy to believe Alba has a long future ahead of her as an actress - which is something you don't feel when watching her movies like 'Honey' and 'Idle Hands.' Secondly, there's Michael Weatherly, who plays cyberjournalist Logan Cale. He's a good, charismatic actor with the smarts to underplay his role, which gives credibility to even some of the comic-book dialogue. Lastly, there's James Cameron's input as producer; you may remember him as the creator of the Terminator films, along as the director of 'Aliens' and 'Titanic.' Naturally, although Cameron's input is minimal, the series has some of Cameron's slightly futuristic cyberpunk feel.Most of the episodes are good, action-packed, escapist adventures, though considerably more downbeat and realistic than most other sci-fi series. No aliens, no reincarnation storylines, and no cute robots! Throughout the first half of the series, Max is almost constantly tracked by a sinister government agent from her past, and this lends the early episodes a constantly anxious atmosphere. If the series could be compared to any other recent shows, the comparisons would be fairest with 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' and 'Smallville.' If you like either show, you will probably enjoy 'Dark Angel.' Like those shows, 'Dark Angel' boasts several varied and extremely entertaining supporting characters and loose story arcs. I can watch two-to-three episodes of 'Dark Angel' in one sitting, which I can't do for many sci-fi series.As the series progresses, there are some weak episodes, but the good outweighs the bad in this package. The extras aren't anything to get excited about, but it's certainly nice to have a few mini-documentaries, outtakes and commentary tracks. Most TV boxed sets have very limited extras at best, so the extras on this set are actually pretty decent for a TV show.Be warned, however, that although a second box set exists, the show was radically changed in the second season. Cameron ditched most of the supporting players and started over in an 'X-Men' style, including more wisecracks and bizarre mutants, and less of the grit that made Series One special. Much of the menace was removed once Max and Logan faced newer, more comedic adversaries. Not surprisingly, Season Two was the last for this series. Still, we'll always have Season One to cherish, and can hope that one day Cameron will revive the idea for a feature film. Best of luck to you, Jessica and Michael, and thanks for being a part of our lives by starring in this show.",4,Dark Angel's Perfect for Rainy Winter Afternoons,1101600000,"11 28, 2004",2004,3144,"[""'Dark"", 'Angel', 'FOX', 'series', 'never', 'gathered', 'more', 'cult', 'following', 'very', 'well', 'much', 'better', 'DVD', 'ever', 'did', 'TV', 'Angel', 'details', 'partnership', 'genetically', 'enhanced', 'warrior', 'lam', 'partially', 'handicapped', 'vigillante', 'who', 'computer', 'rather', 'gun', 'weapon', 'while', 'three', 'very', 'good', 'reasons', 'First', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'who', 'heroine', 'Max', 'Angel', 'perfectly', 'Alba', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'actress', 'most', 'Alba', 'movie', 'look', 'exceptionally', 'confident', 'skilled', 'Watching', ""'Dark"", 'Angel', 'easy', 'believe', 'Alba', 'long', 'future', 'ahead', 'actress', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'when', 'watching', 'movies', ""'Honey"", ""'Idle"", 'Hands', 'Secondly', 'Michael', 'Weatherly', 'who', 'cyberjournalist', 'Logan', 'Cale', 'good', 'charismatic', 'actor', 'smarts', 'underplay', 'role', 'credibility', 'even', 'comic-book', 'dialogue', 'Lastly', 'James', 'Cameron', 'input', 'producer', 'may', 'remember', 'creator', 'Terminator', 'films', 'director', ""'Aliens"", ""'Titanic"", 'Naturally', 'Cameron', 'input', 'minimal', 'series', 'Cameron', 'slightly', 'futuristic', 'cyberpunk', 'feel.Most', 'episodes', 'are', 'good', 'action-packed', 'escapist', 'adventures', 'considerably', 'more', 'downbeat', 'realistic', 'most', 'other', 'sci-fi', 'series', 'aliens', 'reincarnation', 'storylines', 'cute', 'robots', 'first', 'half', 'series', 'Max', 'almost', 'constantly', 'tracked', 'sinister', 'government', 'agent', 'past', 'early', 'constantly', 'anxious', 'atmosphere', 'series', 'could', 'be', 'compared', 'other', 'recent', 'shows', 'comparisons', 'would', 'be', 'fairest', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', ""'Smallville"", 'like', 'show', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', ""'Dark"", 'Angel', 'shows', 'Angel', 'boasts', 'several', 'varied', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'supporting', 'characters', 'loose', 'story', 'arcs', 'can', 'watch', 'two-to-three', 'episodes', ""'Dark"", 'Angel', 'one', 'sitting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'many', 'sci-fi', 'series.As', 'series', 'are', 'weak', 'episodes', 'good', 'bad', 'package', 'extras', 'are', ""n't"", 'anything', 'get', 'excited', 'certainly', 'nice', 'have', 'few', 'mini-documentaries', 'outtakes', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'Most', 'TV', 'boxed', 'sets', 'have', 'very', 'limited', 'extras', 'best', 'extras', 'set', 'are', 'actually', 'pretty', 'decent', 'TV', 'show.Be', 'warned', 'however', 'second', 'box', 'set', 'exists', 'show', 'was', 'radically', 'changed', 'second', 'season', 'Cameron', 'ditched', 'most', 'supporting', 'players', 'started', 'over', 'X-Men', 'style', 'including', 'more', 'wisecracks', 'bizarre', 'mutants', 'less', 'grit', 'made', 'Series', 'One', 'special', 'Much', 'menace', 'was', 'removed', 'once', 'Max', 'Logan', 'faced', 'newer', 'more', 'comedic', 'adversaries', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'Season', 'Two', 'was', 'last', 'series', 'Still', ""'ll"", 'always', 'have', 'Season', 'One', 'cherish', 'can', 'hope', 'one', 'day', 'Cameron', 'will', 'revive', 'idea', 'feature', 'film', 'Best', 'luck', 'Jessica', 'Michael', 'thanks', 'being', 'part', 'lives', 'starring', 'show']",N/A

601611,A1XX5797TIZT5Q,B00005JLJM,D. Mok,"[5, 6]","One of Dark Angel's great gifts is that unlike Alias or La Femme Nikita, this show did not overuse and exploit the sexuality of its female lead.  The other two shows craft their own action heroine, but often condescend towards her from a strictly male perspective.  Dark Angel's Max is a far more interesting and truly strong character with strengths and flaws, and as a result makes a better female lead.Jessica Alba isn't that experienced an actress and her performance in the first third of this season is good but flawed.  She always excelled at the comedic moments, but she didn't nail the latent ferocity of the character until later in the season.  By the time William Gregory Lee (Zack) enters the picture, happily, Alba is in control, and the show finds its narrative focus as well.  John Savage is excellent as the ruthless but strangely vulnerable Lydecker, and the enormously charismatic Michael Weatherly is the perfect foil to Alba.  The supporting regulars are perfect:  Valarie Rae Miller, as Original Cindy, deserves applause for playing one of the first truly well-rounded lesbian characters I've seen on TV.  This character is not defined or trapped by her lesbianism, but merely enriched.  Alimi Ballard is a hoot and a half as ganja-smoking Herbal Thought; Richard Gunn is lovably bumbling as Sketchy; Jennifer Blanc plays sultry roommate Kendra; and J.C. Mackenzie's turn as obsessive Republican fanatic Normal is a comic delight.I'm not too fond of Dark Angel's overt passes at post-modern techniques -- those video speed ramps got on my nerves after one episode, and the opening titles look strangely cheesy.  However, the production values throughout are high, and the action scenes are terrific, making the martial-arts scenes in Buffy the Vampire Slayer look downright primitive.  And the world of post-apocalyptic Seattle they created is intoxicating, a never-ending wasteland of hip-hop culture, old-New-York-style graffiti and technoscapes.Some of these episodes are slow and ponderous -- the weakest being the dull, snail-paced serial-killer yarn ""Pollo Loco"" and ""Shortie's in Love"", which was hurt by an overtly preachy pro-lesbian tone and a weak, one-note performance by Tangelia Rouse, who is simply no match for Valarie Rae Miller and only serves to bog her down.All in all, this was a very good show.  Given its enormous production scope, I was hardly surprised that the show didn't survive.  But even given its short lifespan, Dark Angel has already left an impressive legacy and will no doubt become one of the premier cult shows of the decade.",4,Flawed brilliance.,1065744000,"10 10, 2003",2003,2584,"['One', 'Dark', 'Angel', 'great', 'gifts', 'Alias', 'La', 'Femme', 'Nikita', 'show', 'did', 'not', 'overuse', 'exploit', 'sexuality', 'female', 'lead', 'other', 'two', 'shows', 'craft', 'own', 'action', 'heroine', 'often', 'condescend', 'towards', 'strictly', 'male', 'perspective', 'Dark', 'Angel', 'Max', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'truly', 'strong', 'character', 'strengths', 'flaws', 'result', 'better', 'female', 'lead.Jessica', 'Alba', ""n't"", 'that', 'experienced', 'actress', 'performance', 'first', 'third', 'season', 'good', 'flawed', 'always', 'excelled', 'comedic', 'moments', 'did', ""n't"", 'nail', 'latent', 'ferocity', 'character', 'later', 'season', 'time', 'William', 'Gregory', 'Lee', 'Zack', 'picture', 'happily', 'Alba', 'control', 'show', 'narrative', 'focus', 'as', 'well', 'John', 'Savage', 'excellent', 'ruthless', 'strangely', 'vulnerable', 'Lydecker', 'enormously', 'charismatic', 'Michael', 'Weatherly', 'perfect', 'foil', 'Alba', 'supporting', 'regulars', 'are', 'perfect', 'Valarie', 'Rae', 'Miller', 'Original', 'Cindy', 'applause', 'playing', 'one', 'first', 'truly', 'well-rounded', 'lesbian', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'TV', 'character', 'not', 'defined', 'trapped', 'lesbianism', 'merely', 'enriched', 'Alimi', 'Ballard', 'hoot', 'half', 'ganja-smoking', 'Herbal', 'Thought', 'Richard', 'Gunn', 'lovably', 'bumbling', 'Sketchy', 'Jennifer', 'Blanc', 'sultry', 'roommate', 'Kendra', 'J.C.', 'Mackenzie', 'turn', 'obsessive', 'Republican', 'fanatic', 'Normal', 'comic', 'delight.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'too', 'fond', 'Dark', 'Angel', 'overt', 'passes', 'post-modern', 'techniques', 'video', 'speed', 'ramps', 'got', 'nerves', 'one', 'episode', 'opening', 'titles', 'look', 'strangely', 'cheesy', 'However', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'high', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'terrific', 'making', 'martial-arts', 'scenes', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'look', 'downright', 'primitive', 'world', 'post-apocalyptic', 'Seattle', 'created', 'intoxicating', 'never-ending', 'wasteland', 'hip-hop', 'culture', 'old-New-York-style', 'graffiti', 'technoscapes.Some', 'episodes', 'are', 'slow', 'ponderous', 'weakest', 'being', 'dull', 'snail-paced', 'serial-killer', 'yarn', 'Pollo', 'Loco', 'Shortie', 'Love', 'was', 'hurt', 'overtly', 'preachy', 'pro-lesbian', 'tone', 'weak', 'one-note', 'performance', 'Tangelia', 'Rouse', 'who', 'simply', 'match', 'Valarie', 'Rae', 'Miller', 'only', 'bog', 'down.All', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'show', 'Given', 'enormous', 'production', 'scope', 'was', 'hardly', 'surprised', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'survive', 'even', 'given', 'short', 'lifespan', 'Dark', 'Angel', 'already', 'left', 'impressive', 'legacy', 'will', 'doubt', 'become', 'one', 'premier', 'cult', 'shows', 'decade']",N/A

It just looked so dumb when advertised that I figured the show had to be empty. But it wasn't at all. There were some really solid episodes. I do admit, the show is weak in certain areas and probably 4 instead of five stars, but the entertainment vector is still very high.Scenario: In the near future, the military uses a biotechnology company called Manticore to create super human DNA by mixing it with shark, cat, wolf, etc. and then raising the children created to become super-soldiers (hence some matrix like abilities). While escaping, half of the child soldiers are killed and the other half are on the run forever. Dark Angel lives in Seattle, and with the help of ""Eyes-only"" is trying to find the others who made it out. Eyes-only is a philanthropist crusader (the son of a rich man) who teams up with Angel for mutual benefit. Social services have broken down after ""the pulse"", an electromagnetic weapon that reduced the United States to the Stone Age overnight. As a broke, ex-super-power, there is debris in the streets and military checkpoints everywhere. So, basically there's the future angle, the apocalyptic angle and the bio-engineered super human angle, which is nice.

601618,AE3UVCX1AI3DS,B00005JLJM,"""eghan6""","[3, 3]","Being a a loyal fan of Joss Whedon and virtually all his creations, my initial preconcieved notions towards this show were kind of contemptful - Fox is putting on a show called ""Dark Angel"" opposite a show called ""Angel"".  Talk about bait and hijack.  However, when I began to view this show, it became highly addictive.My primary attraction to this show was definitely Jessica Alba as I was hard-pressed to find her on screen anywhere after her memorable stint in the movie ""Idle Hands"".  Though the character of Max was not as multi-dimensional as other super-human female heroines (should be obvious who I am referring to), her appeal laid in her opposing efforts to escape and reunite from her controversial past.  The show also provided a sense of dystopian escapism in a ""post-apocalyptic"" not-too-distant future; one could catch a glimpse of a world which was not necessarily reality, but one that could be in the near future (a massive electromagnetic pulse rendered the technologically dependent Seattle a veritable dark-age).  Alba is consistent and often impressive as an indifferent member of society (she's a thief) but is not without her personal sense of right and wrong.  Her supporting cast led by fiancee Michael Weatherly (harumpff!!) creates a formidable dynamic for Max's inner-circle.  Logan and Lydecker are  representative of Max's inability to escape her past while characters like Original Cindy, Sketch and Normal belong to Max's desired circle (I use ""desired"" loosely in reference to Normal) in her pursuit of a normal life.The strength of this show lied in its ability to maintain relatively isolated storylines with the subtle presence of an overreaching arc.  Most of this season consisted of stand-alone episodes, where some of the more memorable ones involved encounters from Max's past (Ben, Lydecker, Zack, Tinga and other X-5's).  The show was eager to get its viewers into the mythology and the history of the characters.Sadly the run of the series was cut short after the second season just as the epic nature of Max's past and the introduction of Joshua began to flourish and expand the storytelling capacity of the show.This is a great set for those of you who are new to the show and wish to get in on the ground floor of this story; great stunts, cool bikes and.... uh.... oh yeah...hot chick.",4,Be my dark angel any day,1052784000,"05 13, 2003",2003,2336,"['Being', 'loyal', 'fan', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'virtually', 'creations', 'initial', 'preconcieved', 'notions', 'show', 'were', 'kind', 'contemptful', 'Fox', 'putting', 'show', 'called', 'Dark', 'Angel', 'show', 'called', 'Angel', 'Talk', 'bait', 'hijack', 'However', 'when', 'began', 'view', 'show', 'became', 'highly', 'addictive.My', 'primary', 'attraction', 'show', 'was', 'definitely', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'was', 'hard-pressed', 'find', 'screen', 'anywhere', 'memorable', 'stint', 'movie', 'Idle', 'Hands', 'character', 'Max', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'multi-dimensional', 'other', 'super-human', 'female', 'heroines', 'should', 'be', 'obvious', 'who', 'am', 'referring', 'appeal', 'laid', 'opposing', 'efforts', 'escape', 'reunite', 'controversial', 'past', 'show', 'also', 'provided', 'sense', 'dystopian', 'escapism', 'post-apocalyptic', 'not-too-distant', 'future', 'one', 'could', 'catch', 'glimpse', 'world', 'was', 'not', 'necessarily', 'reality', 'one', 'could', 'be', 'near', 'future', 'massive', 'electromagnetic', 'pulse', 'rendered', 'technologically', 'dependent', 'Seattle', 'veritable', 'dark-age', 'Alba', 'consistent', 'often', 'impressive', 'indifferent', 'member', 'society', 'thief', 'not', 'personal', 'sense', 'right', 'wrong', 'supporting', 'cast', 'led', 'fiancee', 'Michael', 'Weatherly', 'harumpff', 'formidable', 'dynamic', 'Max', 'inner-circle', 'Logan', 'Lydecker', 'are', 'representative', 'Max', 'inability', 'escape', 'past', 'characters', 'Original', 'Cindy', 'Sketch', 'Normal', 'belong', 'Max', 'desired', 'circle', 'use', 'desired', 'loosely', 'reference', 'Normal', 'pursuit', 'normal', 'life.The', 'strength', 'show', 'lied', 'ability', 'maintain', 'relatively', 'isolated', 'storylines', 'subtle', 'presence', 'overreaching', 'arc', 'Most', 'season', 'consisted', 'stand-alone', 'episodes', 'where', 'more', 'memorable', 'ones', 'involved', 'encounters', 'Max', 'past', 'Ben', 'Lydecker', 'Zack', 'Tinga', 'other', 'X-5', 'show', 'was', 'eager', 'get', 'viewers', 'mythology', 'history', 'characters.Sadly', 'run', 'series', 'was', 'cut', 'short', 'second', 'season', 'just', 'epic', 'nature', 'Max', 'past', 'introduction', 'Joshua', 'began', 'flourish', 'expand', 'storytelling', 'capacity', 'show.This', 'great', 'set', 'who', 'are', 'new', 'show', 'wish', 'get', 'ground', 'floor', 'story', 'great', 'stunts', 'cool', 'bikes', 'uh', 'oh', 'yeah', 'hot', 'chick']",N/A

601620,A7PKDOBWW3WQG,B00005JLJM,flask,"[6, 10]","James Cameron's ""Dark Angel,"" starring Jessica Marie Alba, debuted on television with the glitzy fanfare of a P.T. Barnum exhibit. It was intended to be Fox's answer to ""Buffy: The Vampire Slayer,"" but unlike the latter show, ""Dark Angel"" never lived up to the potential which it displayed in the pilot episode.The lead character, Max Guevera/X5-452 (Alba), with her enhanced feline abilities was interesting enough despite the all-too-familiar ""I just wanna be normal"" superhero formula lurking underneath. Gratuitous shots of Alba in a skin-tight leather outfit was undoubtedly a major selling point with the teenage male audience but cheapened the series to the level of a D.C. comic book.The overarching plot involving super-soldiers whose DNA had been artificially engineered, inserted as fertilized eggs into the wombs of surrogate mothers, born under military supervision, and then escaped as children was clich&eacute;, but still interesting. This was tacked onto a futuristic setting in which a dystopian Seattle has been devastated by an electromagnetic pulse. These two premises were mildly compelling, and the show was at its best when exploring them, but the moment it would veer into bizarre subplots, it would fall from an average weekly thriller to a stinking pile of fungus.The ensemble cast that populated the show was by far the worst failing of this short-lived series. The supporting characters were stereotypes painted in broad, one-dimensional strokes (i.e. Original Cindy) and sounded like imbeciles. The point of using slang is to make communication quicker, not to use it so much in a sing-song fashion that basic conversation becomes ridiculous. Apparently, middle-aged creators James Cameron and Charles Eglee were trying so hard to make a hip show that appealed to teenie boppers that they didn't realize being too trendy is just as detrimental as being too normal.Coupled with the annoying overuse of rat-tat-tat-tat dialogue, a ""battle of the sexes"" theme existed throughout the series which could have been wickedly amusing if it hadn't usually lacked wit. Max saying lines such as, ""Girls kick ass, it says so on a T-shirt"" was humorous. Max saying lines such as, ""Guys are the weaker sex"" to a grieving widow who has just lost her beloved husband only makes the audience groan. Comedy is a difficult art. The Dark Angel writers should have remembered Mel Brooks' famous advice, ""If I cut my finger, that's tragedy. If a man walks into an open sewer and dies, that's comedy.""For the action scenes in which Max displayed her ""dizzying"" superpowers, the Dark Angel crew often utilized a simple fast-forwarding technique. This is an effective trick if executed correctly, but instead it often came across as sped-up footage from a shaky hand-held video camera. In retrospect, far more interesting combat effects could have been created using wire stunts ala the choreography of Yuen W. Ping.Ultimately, the corniness of ""Dark Angel"" became more and more insufferable; the weekly episode writing didn't improve; the characters became so posh they were snotty. Midway through the first season its Nielsen ratings began to slip. Seeing no quality improvement, viewers abandoned ""Dark Angel"" like rats from a sinking ship. By the second season, the once-promising series had degraded to having Max slaying Buffy-like monsters and encountering freakish mutants that seemed borrowed from X-Men comics. If only the series writers had aimed for a wider demographic audience other than teenagers and focused lesson being devastatingly hip, ""Dark Angel"" might have lasted a few more seasons.",3,A show with great potential that became progressively worse.,1071014400,"12 10, 2003",2003,3611,"['James', 'Cameron', 'Dark', 'Angel', 'starring', 'Jessica', 'Marie', 'Alba', 'debuted', 'television', 'glitzy', 'fanfare', 'P.T', 'Barnum', 'exhibit', 'was', 'intended', 'be', 'Fox', 'answer', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'latter', 'show', 'Dark', 'Angel', 'never', 'lived', 'up', 'potential', 'displayed', 'pilot', 'episode.The', 'lead', 'character', 'Max', 'Guevera/X5-452', 'Alba', 'enhanced', 'feline', 'abilities', 'was', 'interesting', 'enough', 'all-too-familiar', 'just', 'wan', 'na', 'be', 'normal', 'superhero', 'formula', 'lurking', 'underneath', 'Gratuitous', 'shots', 'Alba', 'skin-tight', 'leather', 'outfit', 'was', 'undoubtedly', 'major', 'selling', 'point', 'teenage', 'male', 'audience', 'cheapened', 'series', 'level', 'D.C.', 'comic', 'book.The', 'overarching', 'plot', 'involving', 'super-soldiers', 'DNA', 'had', 'been', 'artificially', 'engineered', 'inserted', 'fertilized', 'eggs', 'wombs', 'surrogate', 'mothers', 'born', 'military', 'supervision', 'then', 'escaped', 'children', 'was', 'clich', 'eacute', 'still', 'interesting', 'was', 'tacked', 'futuristic', 'setting', 'dystopian', 'Seattle', 'been', 'devastated', 'electromagnetic', 'pulse', 'two', 'premises', 'were', 'mildly', 'compelling', 'show', 'was', 'best', 'when', 'exploring', 'moment', 'would', 'veer', 'bizarre', 'subplots', 'would', 'fall', 'average', 'weekly', 'thriller', 'stinking', 'pile', 'fungus.The', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'populated', 'show', 'was', 'far', 'worst', 'failing', 'short-lived', 'series', 'supporting', 'characters', 'were', 'stereotypes', 'painted', 'broad', 'one-dimensional', 'strokes', 'i.e', 'Original', 'Cindy', 'sounded', 'imbeciles', 'point', 'using', 'slang', 'make', 'communication', 'quicker', 'not', 'use', 'so', 'much', 'sing-song', 'fashion', 'basic', 'conversation', 'ridiculous', 'Apparently', 'middle-aged', 'creators', 'James', 'Cameron', 'Charles', 'Eglee', 'were', 'trying', 'so', 'hard', 'make', 'hip', 'show', 'appealed', 'teenie', 'boppers', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'being', 'too', 'trendy', 'just', 'as', 'detrimental', 'being', 'too', 'normal.Coupled', 'annoying', 'overuse', 'rat-tat-tat-tat', 'dialogue', 'battle', 'sexes', 'theme', 'existed', 'series', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'wickedly', 'amusing', 'had', ""n't"", 'usually', 'lacked', 'wit', 'Max', 'saying', 'lines', 'such', 'Girls', 'kick', 'ass', 'so', 'T-shirt', 'was', 'humorous', 'Max', 'saying', 'lines', 'such', 'Guys', 'are', 'weaker', 'sex', 'grieving', 'widow', 'who', 'just', 'lost', 'beloved', 'husband', 'only', 'audience', 'groan', 'Comedy', 'difficult', 'art', 'Dark', 'Angel', 'writers', 'should', 'have', 'remembered', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'famous', 'advice', 'cut', 'finger', 'tragedy', 'man', 'open', 'sewer', 'dies', 'comedy', 'action', 'scenes', 'Max', 'displayed', 'dizzying', 'superpowers', 'Dark', 'Angel', 'crew', 'often', 'utilized', 'simple', 'fast-forwarding', 'technique', 'effective', 'trick', 'executed', 'correctly', 'instead', 'often', 'came', 'sped-up', 'footage', 'shaky', 'hand-held', 'video', 'camera', 'retrospect', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'combat', 'effects', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'created', 'using', 'wire', 'stunts', 'ala', 'choreography', 'Yuen', 'W.', 'Ping.Ultimately', 'corniness', 'Dark', 'Angel', 'became', 'more', 'more', 'insufferable', 'weekly', 'episode', 'writing', 'did', ""n't"", 'improve', 'characters', 'became', 'so', 'posh', 'were', 'snotty', 'Midway', 'first', 'season', 'Nielsen', 'ratings', 'began', 'slip', 'Seeing', 'quality', 'improvement', 'viewers', 'abandoned', 'Dark', 'Angel', 'rats', 'sinking', 'ship', 'second', 'season', 'once-promising', 'series', 'had', 'degraded', 'having', 'Max', 'slaying', 'Buffy-like', 'monsters', 'encountering', 'freakish', 'mutants', 'seemed', 'borrowed', 'X-Men', 'comics', 'only', 'series', 'writers', 'had', 'aimed', 'wider', 'demographic', 'audience', 'other', 'teenagers', 'focused', 'lesson', 'being', 'devastatingly', 'hip', 'Dark', 'Angel', 'might', 'have', 'lasted', 'few', 'more', 'seasons']",N/A

601622,A1OZFMJ2AD2R41,B00005JLJM,Furiae,"[0, 0]","When Dark Angel first came out, I was not impressed, for some reason.  I actually only watched the first episode and the last episode in the series.  For some reason, I didn't give it the time of day, not to mention a chance to grip my attention.  At the time, it was competing with Buffy, Angel, and all the other WB shows for ratings.Well, I waltzed through the store last week and saw the DVD set on sale.  I had plenty of time to kill and was bored off my rocker, so I bought it so I could watch it and kill time.  I went home, popped the first disc in my DVD rom, and decided I'd watch some of it on the computer then do some work.  I got absolutely no work done that day.  I started watching at noon and I sat at my darn desk until the wee hours of morning to finish the set.  For days, I couldn't think anything BUT Dark Angel.The story centers around Max, a genetically engineered super soldier who escaped from her facility with a 12 other 'siblings' when she was 9 years old.  The scene is grunge-ish, set in post-Pulse Seattle.  (The Pulse- in 2009 terrorists set off an electromagnet pulse 80 miles up in the air over the U.S. which fried every computer chip in the country and turned America into a 3rd world country overnight.)  Since records were lost, she easily slipped into society.  However, she's been avoiding being recaptured by the military, fully knowing they're hunting her and her siblings down.The fight scenes are awesome.  I felt guilty buying Dark Angel since I'm a die hard Buffy fan, but man, the fight scenes in DA are so stylized, suave, and stellar that I finally admitted (after a while) that they surpassed Buffy and Angel.  The story was also very tight, sensible, and intelligent.  There's an element of mystery in the plot because Max is completely out of the loop.  She has no idea where her fellow X5's are and she really doesn't know that much about her origin, since so much of her history is hidden under conspiracy.The entire cast was superb.  The villians were deliciously good at being bad, but they were complex, as well.  The man who's hunting down the escaped X5's is named Lydecker (he also was the one who trained them), but his reason for finding them is much more complicated than originally thought.  He has a very twisted fathering complex.  He cares about his ""kids"" in a rather demented way, in that he truly believes he's bringing them ""home.""Each character has depth and complexity.  The supporting cast is humorous, and, at times, hilarious.  Each character was defined.It was such an amazing show.  Issues weren't resolved and answers werent' given at the end of every episode.  Just enough was resolved to give a sense of satisfaction, but there is so much curiosity as to what happens next that you can't help but pop the next disc in (and the next, and the next...)I'm deeply saddened in knowing the series was cancelled.  There was so much talent and quality involved in this series that it's an absolute shame it didn't continue.I truly believe that it was just a case of 'the wrong place at the wrong time.'  For some reason, the timing was just off.  People didn't give it the attention it deserved.  I was one of them, but now that I look back, I wonder, ""Why in the world did I miss this for other shows I barely remember now?!""  Also, it was competing with shows like Charmed and Angel, which were riding high at the time.  If Dark Angel aired now, it would absolutely dominate the genre and would create a new precedent for television, and quite possibly, be history in the making.  I guess some things just aren't meant to be, though, but I'm awfully glad it's come out on DVD.Dark Angel was ahead of its time.  When I first watched it, I just didn't get into it and I didn't think the dialogue was all that witty or funny.

Dark Angel is an interesting & innovative show featuring a charismatic lead in Jessica Alba whose acting skills I doubted before seeing this series.  Is she Oscar or Emmy worthy? - No but her lack of true expression aka ""fighter face"" works with the character and her skills DID improve in later episodes.The episodes had a good balance between the drama of ""Max"" evading capture while searching for her fellow X-5 brothers & sisters and the comedic relief provided by her co-workers at Jam Pony.  The writing and pacing of the episodes also drew me in and kept me interested - they never went too ""dark"" and always had some type of comic relief or side story while never veering too far from the main storyline.The supporting actors all lend individual touches to liven up the stories but I especially enjoyed the interactions between Alba & Michael Weatherly (""Eyes Only"") and Alba & Valerie Rae Miller (""Original Cindy"")- I could see the actors building real relationships with each other during the filming and it made their scenes so much more believable. A lot of reviewers have commented on the overuse of slang - it was mildly annoying during the few few episodes but honestly I just got used to it as another ""hook"" to interest viewers who talked like that during that particular era.Overall I really enjoyed watching the series at my own pace and wish that it had lasted longer than 2 seasons.

601626,A19FMZXEPQKZ52,B00005JLJM,"Helen Travis ""Helen Travis""","[4, 4]","Fans of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" are sure to enjoy watching  Jessica Alba, as a genetically engineered perfect solider, kick and wise-crack her way through a hostile America of the future.Alba's character, Max, was created by Manticore, the evil, secret organization every bad government craves. But Max and a handfull of her superpowered ""siblings"" escape in dramatic and fantastically filmed fashion. (Prepare to see it over-replayed in flashbacks.)After an electromagnetic pulse craters the world's economy, Max's main goal is to stay free. She'd also like to keep her fellow X5 ""siblings"" (all as hunky as genetic engineering allows)  out of Manticore's clutches.But reluctantly at first and then with more enthusiasm, Max helps normal humans fight injustice. Wow does she fight. And fight! Kick boxing, fisticuffs, flying through the air at impossible trajectories, nothing is too tough for Max, thanks to a bit of feline DNA in her genetic cocktail.It's hard not to enjoy Alba in this role, riding her motorcycle, wearing black leather and reeling off witty one-liners as she sends bad guys flying. The washed-out blonde version of Alba in the ""Fantastic Four"" films isn't having nearly this much fun.No wonder resistance fighter ""Eyes Only,"" played by Michael Weatherly (NCIS), is hot for her. And he's not her only ally. Keep an eye out for Jensen Ackles (Supernatural) popping up as one of Max's X5 ""brothers.""Season One is better than Season Two but both are must have's if there's an action-adventure, fantasy or sci-fi-loving bone in your body. The only downside to ""Dark Angel"" is that it didn't last longer. Because the series was created by James Cameron (Titanic) Fox hoped for a blockbuster and was not willing to settle for a mere cult following.

601627,A3OT8HDV03UV0U,B00005JLJM,IhateMTV,"[26, 47]","(Yes, I expect a bunch of negative helpful ratings like everyone else who gave this show 1 or 2 stars. I guess some fans can't accept opinions that differ from their own.)After getting into Buffy the Vampire Slayer this past year, I was anxious to find another show that was similar to it. Assuming this would be just as good as Buffy, I bought it (without ever watching an episode before) for $20. Big mistake, although I'm thankful that I bought it for a sale price instead of shelling out $40+ bucks for something this bad. I guess you could say it was a stupid decision, but I've done the same for other shows that I eventually went on to enjoy. Now, this review won't be completely fair since I've only seen 12 episodes (even though I've had the DVD set for two months), but I'll review by what I've seen so far. The fact that I find it painful to sit through an episode should be an indicator of Dark Angel's quality. In comparison, I watched 144 episodes of Buffy in one month, while it's taken me 2 months just to watch 12 episodes of Dark Angel.The biggest problem with DA seems to be the horrid acting, and the even worse dialogue. It seems like the writers were trying way too hard to make this show ""extra-hip and cool"", but it just comes across as lame and embarassing. They even have guest appearances from people like Master P and Mack 10, which continues to show that the creators favor hipness over acting ability. The main character Max (played by Jessica Alba of course) seems to do nothing but spout off lame lingo. She'll have serious discussions every once in awhile to advance the plot, but most of the time her dialogue consists of nothing but annoying phrases such as ""I gotta Blaze!"" (actually, I believe she says that at least once in every episode). The way Alba delivers her lines makes it all the more annoying. For the people that haven't seen the show, here's an example of some of the ""brilliant"" dialogue you'll find in the show:Random peeper: ""I'm sorry Max, but you're the bomb!""Max: ""Ka-Boom!"" (*kicks him in the crotch*)""Or how about some of the episode titles? ""411 On the DL"", ""Blah Blah Woof Woof"", ""The Kidz Are Aiight"", and ""Shorties in Love"". Yeah, I know their only titles, but that gives you an idea of the juvenile writing on this show (come on, they can't even pick good names for their episodes...)While Buffy entertained me with some of it's humorous one-liners, Dark Angel's attempts to be funny fall flat everytime. Speaking of flat, lets move on to the supporting characters. Michael Weatherly plays the second main character, the wheel-chair bound Logan Cale. While Michael isn't the greatest actor, he looks like Robert De Niro when compared to the rest. Without him, I'd probably go insane from watching this show. He's the only one that seems to talk like a regular person, instead of attempting to use as many hip one-liners as possible like everyone else. Max's boss, 'Normal', also talks, well...normal, but even a brick has more emotion than him. 'Sketchy', a guy who works with Max, isn't too bad, but the only reason he's there is for comedy relief (which makes him pointless since he isn't funny at all). Finally, there's Original Cindy, Max's best friend. It seems that every line Cindy has is nothing but the type of ""Hey, look how hip we are!"" dialogue that I mentioned before, which makes her another useless and annoying character.The plot is decent so far. Nothing special just yet, but it's nice to see that most episodes contain continuity. Also, there is some character development, which is always a plus. With a better cast and writers, this could have actually become a great show.Overall, avoid this one, even if you are a fan of similar shows. I am not a Buffy fanboy or anything, but I'd easily recommend getting all 7 seasons of that and the 5 seasons of Angel before ever getting this. There are a few positive aspects of this show, but I could easily name 5 terrible apects for every good one.",1,People actually like this?,1110067200,"03 6, 2005",2005,3975,"['Yes', 'expect', 'bunch', 'negative', 'helpful', 'ratings', 'everyone', 'else', 'who', 'gave', 'show', '1', '2', 'stars', 'guess', 'fans', 'ca', ""n't"", 'accept', 'opinions', 'differ', 'own', 'getting', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'past', 'year', 'was', 'anxious', 'find', 'show', 'was', 'similar', 'Assuming', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'Buffy', 'bought', 'ever', 'watching', 'episode', '20', 'Big', 'mistake', ""'m"", 'thankful', 'bought', 'sale', 'price', 'instead', 'shelling', 'out', '40+', 'bucks', 'something', 'bad', 'guess', 'could', 'say', 'was', 'stupid', 'decision', ""'ve"", 'done', 'same', 'other', 'shows', 'eventually', 'went', 'enjoy', 'Now', 'review', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'completely', 'fair', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', '12', 'episodes', 'even', ""'ve"", 'had', 'DVD', 'set', 'two', 'months', ""'ll"", 'review', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'fact', 'find', 'painful', 'sit', 'episode', 'should', 'be', 'indicator', 'Dark', 'Angel', 'quality', 'comparison', 'watched', '144', 'episodes', 'Buffy', 'one', 'month', 'taken', '2', 'months', 'just', 'watch', '12', 'episodes', 'Dark', 'Angel.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'DA', 'be', 'horrid', 'acting', 'even', 'worse', 'dialogue', 'writers', 'were', 'trying', 'way', 'too', 'hard', 'make', 'show', 'extra-hip', 'cool', 'just', 'across', 'lame', 'embarassing', 'even', 'have', 'guest', 'appearances', 'people', 'Master', 'P', 'Mack', '10', 'show', 'creators', 'favor', 'hipness', 'acting', 'ability', 'main', 'character', 'Max', 'played', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'course', 'do', 'nothing', 'spout', 'off', 'lame', 'lingo', ""'ll"", 'have', 'serious', 'discussions', 'once', 'awhile', 'advance', 'plot', 'most', 'time', 'dialogue', 'nothing', 'annoying', 'phrases', 'such', 'got', 'ta', 'Blaze', 'actually', 'believe', 'least', 'once', 'episode', 'way', 'Alba', 'lines', 'more', 'annoying', 'people', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'show', 'here', 'example', 'brilliant', 'dialogue', ""'ll"", 'find', 'show', 'Random', 'peeper', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'Max', ""'re"", 'bomb', 'Max', 'Ka-Boom', 'crotch*', 'how', 'episode', 'titles', '411', 'DL', 'Blah', 'Blah', 'Woof', 'Woof', 'Kidz', 'Are', 'Aiight', 'Shorties', 'Love', 'Yeah', 'know', 'only', 'titles', 'idea', 'juvenile', 'writing', 'show', 'come', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'pick', 'good', 'names', 'episodes', 'Buffy', 'entertained', 'humorous', 'one-liners', 'Dark', 'Angel', 'attempts', 'be', 'funny', 'fall', 'flat', 'everytime', 'Speaking', 'flat', 'move', 'supporting', 'characters', 'Michael', 'Weatherly', 'second', 'main', 'character', 'wheel-chair', 'bound', 'Logan', 'Cale', 'Michael', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'actor', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'when', 'compared', 'rest', ""'d"", 'probably', 'go', 'insane', 'watching', 'show', 'only', 'one', 'talk', 'regular', 'person', 'instead', 'attempting', 'use', 'many', 'hip', 'one-liners', 'possible', 'everyone', 'else', 'Max', 'boss', 'also', 'talks', 'well', 'normal', 'even', 'brick', 'more', 'emotion', 'guy', 'who', 'Max', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'only', 'reason', 'comedy', 'relief', 'pointless', ""n't"", 'funny', 'Finally', 'Original', 'Cindy', 'Max', 'best', 'friend', 'line', 'Cindy', 'nothing', 'type', 'Hey', 'look', 'how', 'hip', 'are', 'dialogue', 'mentioned', 'useless', 'annoying', 'character.The', 'plot', 'decent', 'so', 'far', 'Nothing', 'special', 'just', 'yet', 'nice', 'see', 'most', 'episodes', 'contain', 'continuity', 'Also', 'character', 'development', 'always', 'plus', 'better', 'cast', 'writers', 'could', 'have', 'actually', 'become', 'great', 'show.Overall', 'avoid', 'one', 'even', 'are', 'fan', 'similar', 'shows', 'am', 'not', 'Buffy', 'fanboy', 'anything', ""'d"", 'easily', 'recommend', 'getting', '7', 'seasons', '5', 'seasons', 'Angel', 'ever', 'getting', 'are', 'few', 'positive', 'aspects', 'show', 'could', 'easily', 'name', '5', 'terrible', 'apects', 'good', 'one']",N/A

She reminds me of Buffy without the witty dialogue, but she kicks [...] anyway.  I actually like Jessica Alba a lot more after seeing the show, which is why it's too bad that she can't act.  She's beautiful, can do a convincing seizure shake, kick [...], and even cry on cue, but deliver lines....lets just say Keanu Reeves is more convincing with his blanket inflections then she is.  I haven't seen season 2, so maybe she gets better...but from other movies I've seen with her in it...I doubt it.

While we might not be able to create superhuman soldiers like X5s as of yet, someday, we might just be able to. Its certainly a possibility sometime down the road. And the pulse that shut everything down is certainly possible as well, as scary as that might be with all these terrorist threats as of late and many countries hating the guts of the United States. As much as we'd all rather something like that NOT happen, lets face it, its certainly possible.The characters were for the most part believable and interesting.I thought Lydecker made the perfect villain. He is pretty evil and vile in his own way, but you can tell that he also loves his creations the way a parent might love his offspring, so this was a nice approach. Despite being a ruthless and remorseless killer himself, he did have an ounce of humanity, which made him that much more of an interesting villain. Maddom X was another interesting villain, and certainly a trecherous one as well, and definitely one that doesn't seem to share Lydecker's love for the X5 series.I had mix feelings about the supporting cast.Logan was a great character. A dark and brooding introvert in a wheel chair most of the time, but really coming alive when he does his Eyes Only installments on the TV.The other supporting Cast, Normal, Original Cindy, etc. were okay, though not that great, but certainly funny at times, and necessary to the story in Max's quest to live a somewhat normal live despite her origins and the circumstances surrounding her.And of course Max was a great protagonist, and someone whom you could relate to, despite none of us having been born in some top-secret government lab and given superhuman abilities. But she still is very much human, despite not exactly being human, and wanting to find others like herself, people she can relate to and bond with,the way most humans do, and having basic human emotions.The episodes were good and had some interesting twists and storylines, though like any other TV series, some were better than others. I probably enjoyed the episodes in the middle and towards the end of the season more so than the earlier ones, though, for whatever reason. Among my personal favorites of season one: ""Prodigy,"" ""Cold Comfort,"" ""Rising,"" ""The Kids are Aiight,"" ""Haven,"" ""Shorties in Love,"" ""Polo Loco,"" And the season finale ""...And Jesus Brought a Casserole"" was really good too, although I can't for the life of me figure out why they gave it the title they did.I had mixed feelings about the music. I liked the atmospheric music that set the mood up, for the most part, but as for the hip-hop stuff, I'm not really much of a fan of that particular genre of music, but I suppose it added its own contribution to the overall urban atmosphere of Dark Angel.Overall, I enjoyed the series. It was sad when they cancelled it, but I can understand the reasoning behind it. Hopefully they will have Season Two out on DVD so I can buy that one, too, as that was definitely great as well.",4,"Overall, a good series",1054166400,"05 29, 2003",2003,3135,"['must', 'say', 'have', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Dark', 'Angel', 'series', 'overall', 'feel', 'excellent', 'plausible', 'vision', 'future', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'create', 'superhuman', 'soldiers', 'like', 'X5s', 'yet', 'someday', 'might', 'just', 'be', 'able', 'certainly', 'possibility', 'sometime', 'down', 'road', 'pulse', 'shut', 'everything', 'down', 'certainly', 'possible', 'well', 'as', 'scary', 'might', 'be', 'terrorist', 'threats', 'late', 'many', 'countries', 'hating', 'guts', 'United', 'States', 'As', 'much', ""'d"", 'rather', 'something', 'NOT', 'happen', 'face', 'certainly', 'possible.The', 'characters', 'were', 'most', 'part', 'believable', 'interesting.I', 'thought', 'Lydecker', 'made', 'perfect', 'villain', 'pretty', 'evil', 'vile', 'own', 'way', 'can', 'tell', 'also', 'creations', 'way', 'parent', 'might', 'love', 'offspring', 'was', 'nice', 'approach', 'being', 'ruthless', 'remorseless', 'killer', 'did', 'have', 'ounce', 'humanity', 'made', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'villain', 'Maddom', 'X', 'was', 'interesting', 'villain', 'certainly', 'trecherous', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'definitely', 'one', ""n't"", 'seem', 'share', 'Lydecker', 'love', 'X5', 'series.I', 'had', 'mix', 'feelings', 'supporting', 'cast.Logan', 'was', 'great', 'character', 'dark', 'brooding', 'introvert', 'wheel', 'chair', 'most', 'time', 'really', 'coming', 'alive', 'when', 'Eyes', 'Only', 'TV.The', 'other', 'supporting', 'Cast', 'Normal', 'Original', 'Cindy', 'etc', 'were', 'okay', 'not', 'great', 'certainly', 'funny', 'times', 'necessary', 'story', 'Max', 'quest', 'live', 'somewhat', 'normal', 'live', 'origins', 'circumstances', 'surrounding', 'her.And', 'course', 'Max', 'was', 'great', 'protagonist', 'someone', 'whom', 'could', 'relate', 'none', 'having', 'been', 'born', 'top-secret', 'government', 'lab', 'given', 'superhuman', 'abilities', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'human', 'not', 'exactly', 'being', 'human', 'wanting', 'find', 'others', 'people', 'can', 'relate', 'bond', 'way', 'most', 'humans', 'do', 'having', 'basic', 'human', 'emotions.The', 'episodes', 'were', 'good', 'had', 'interesting', 'twists', 'storylines', 'other', 'TV', 'series', 'were', 'better', 'others', 'probably', 'enjoyed', 'episodes', 'middle', 'end', 'season', 'more', 'so', 'earlier', 'ones', 'though', 'reason', 'personal', 'favorites', 'season', 'one', 'Prodigy', 'Cold', 'Comfort', 'Rising', 'Kids', 'are', 'Aiight', 'Haven', 'Shorties', 'Love', 'Polo', 'Loco', 'season', 'finale', 'Jesus', 'Brought', 'Casserole', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'too', 'ca', ""n't"", 'life', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'gave', 'title', 'did.I', 'had', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'music', 'liked', 'atmospheric', 'music', 'set', 'mood', 'up', 'most', 'part', 'hip-hop', 'stuff', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'much', 'fan', 'particular', 'genre', 'music', 'suppose', 'added', 'own', 'contribution', 'overall', 'urban', 'atmosphere', 'Dark', 'Angel.Overall', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'was', 'sad', 'when', 'cancelled', 'can', 'understand', 'reasoning', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'have', 'Season', 'Two', 'out', 'DVD', 'can', 'buy', 'one', 'too', 'was', 'definitely', 'great', 'well']",N/A

601634,AQ5UQXDIJA3R8,B00005JLJM,"J. Tucker ""datashogun""","[7, 9]","I have to give it up to the first season of Dark Angel. I was a fan of the series, but I hadn't seen any of the episodes since they first aired, 'til I got my copy of DA season 1.Holy moley.The writing was nearly as witty as Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and sometimes way ahead of its time. Ever heard of ""defenestration""? No? Check out ""Art Attack""- an episode that featured Master P before he made people say, ""Ugh!Nah-Nah-Nah-Nah!"". This series had music by Jill Scott playing in the background before anyone knew who she was. They used a theme song written by Chuck D. They mentioned the Taliban BEFORE 2001.  These cats were definitely on to something.But more than that, James Cameron et. al. came up with a plot that compares favorably to the best of comic book/sci-fi mythology.  Set in Seattle years after a devastating terrorist attack (someone set off an EMP, frying technology all over the US), this series features a number of people who choose to work towards a better society instead of giving up. In some ways, this reminds me of Cameron's work on the ""Terminator"" series.Jessica Alba (of ""Honey"" fame) plays the main character Max.  She's a genetically engineered meta-human who runs and fights like a modern-day bionic woman.  Max is not your typical hero--in the very first episode we see her using her powers to burgle someone's place. Her foil is Logan, a post-apocalyptic investigative journalist who will definitely remind you about what today's media is missing.Max is befriended by her workmates at Jam Pony messenger service, including Original Cindy--a beautiful African-American woman who speaks her own brand of English, dates other women, and sticks up for her peeps. She meets other people with special abilities, some of whom are out to kill her. It turns out that the government is out to retrieve her, and this leads to a few Matrix-esque wire fighting scenes that made for outstanding TV. By the 3rd or 4th episode, this series finds its stride and builds quickly to an awesome season finale.I wish I could say that season 2 was as good, but it simply wasn't.

601636,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JLJM,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[88, 89]","I do not remember why I missed ""Dark Angel"" when it originally aired, but now that I have seen the first season I am willing to admit I made a big mistake (Mea Culpa, James Cameron). The story is set in Seattle, Washington, in the year 2019, which is after ""The Pulse,"" an electromagnetic bomb that basically pushed reset on the United States. However, that is only the setting, because the star is Jessica Alba as Max Guevera, who at first glance has a day job as a bike courier, and at second glance works as a cat burglar at night, bit at third glance and closer examination turns out to be a genetically enhanced superhuman created by the government who escaped from a military training school ten years earlier.""Dark Angel: The Complete First Season"" has a couple of plot lines that make Max both the hunter and the hunted. Max is always on the lookout for her ""siblings,"" the other kids who escaped from Manticore, while Lydecker (John Savage), the head of the secret program is trying to find both them and Max to return them to government service. Meanwhile, Max's days as a cat burglar are over when she tries to rob Logan Cale (Michael Weatherly), a rich kid who is the secret cyber-journalist known as ""Eyes Only,"" who enlists her into his idealistic crusade to clean up corruption in Seattle. Of course, the two are made for each other, but we have to wait for them to catch out to this rather obvious fact. What really makes ""Dark Angel"" work is the extent to which this futuristic dystopia has been worked out. This is not so much a series where the mythology emerges over time, as it is one where the premises are so strong that they sustain multiple episodes and provide compelling sub-text for the rest. Compare this to similar series that take a while to find themselves, and you can see why these solid premises allowed this one to be able to have so many solid episodes early on.Creator James Cameron's imprint is clearly on this production, but mention should be made of the show's Vancouver crew, which obviously includes a lot of ""X-Files"" veterans. The production values on ""Dark Angel"" are pretty striking in creating the seedy world of post-pulse Seattle and its icon Space Needle where Max likes to go and contemplate existence. But the sense of style comes as much from the characters as the setting. Alba is truly stunning as Max, able to play hard, soft, or whatever the scene demands. Weatherly has one of the squarest jaws in television history, and Savage has fun milking everything out of the bad guy (he really does care for his children, but duty never gets in the way of such emotions). The supporting cast has some compelling texture types, from Normal (J.C. MacKenzie), the overbearing dispatcher at Jam Pony (""Bip! Bip! Bip!""), to urban philosopher Herbal Thought (Alimi Bllard), and everybody's favorite, Original Cindy (Valerie Rae Miller), Max's roommate and co-worker, who basically has the right attitude for every occasion.After watching the complete first season of ""Dark Angel"" you will want to move on to the complete second season, which just came out and you will be disappointed that there were only two seasons of the series. However, when you see the overall drop in quality during season two, you will not be that surprised (it takes half of that second season for the series to really get going). But ""Dark Angel"" is one of the better science fiction series to be produced in the last ten years, and the first season does provide a complete story arc.",5,Jessica Alba as Max the genetically engineered super soldier,1069632000,"11 24, 2003",2003,3507,"['do', 'not', 'remember', 'why', 'missed', 'Dark', 'Angel', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', 'now', 'have', 'seen', 'first', 'season', 'am', 'willing', 'admit', 'made', 'big', 'mistake', 'Mea', 'Culpa', 'James', 'Cameron', 'story', 'set', 'Seattle', 'Washington', 'year', '2019', 'Pulse', 'electromagnetic', 'bomb', 'basically', 'pushed', 'reset', 'United', 'States', 'However', 'only', 'setting', 'star', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'Max', 'Guevera', 'who', 'first', 'glance', 'day', 'job', 'bike', 'courier', 'second', 'glance', 'cat', 'burglar', 'night', 'bit', 'third', 'glance', 'closer', 'examination', 'out', 'be', 'genetically', 'enhanced', 'superhuman', 'created', 'government', 'who', 'escaped', 'military', 'training', 'school', 'ten', 'years', 'earlier', 'Dark', 'Angel', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'couple', 'plot', 'lines', 'make', 'Max', 'hunter', 'hunted', 'Max', 'always', 'lookout', 'siblings', 'other', 'kids', 'who', 'escaped', 'Manticore', 'Lydecker', 'John', 'Savage', 'head', 'secret', 'program', 'trying', 'find', 'Max', 'return', 'government', 'service', 'Meanwhile', 'Max', 'days', 'cat', 'burglar', 'are', 'when', 'rob', 'Logan', 'Cale', 'Michael', 'Weatherly', 'rich', 'kid', 'who', 'secret', 'cyber-journalist', 'known', 'Eyes', 'Only', 'who', 'idealistic', 'crusade', 'clean', 'up', 'corruption', 'Seattle', 'course', 'two', 'are', 'made', 'other', 'have', 'wait', 'catch', 'out', 'rather', 'obvious', 'fact', 'What', 'really', 'Dark', 'Angel', 'work', 'extent', 'futuristic', 'dystopia', 'been', 'worked', 'out', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'series', 'where', 'mythology', 'time', 'one', 'where', 'premises', 'are', 'so', 'strong', 'sustain', 'multiple', 'episodes', 'provide', 'compelling', 'sub-text', 'rest', 'Compare', 'similar', 'series', 'take', 'while', 'find', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'solid', 'premises', 'allowed', 'one', 'be', 'able', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'solid', 'episodes', 'early', 'on.Creator', 'James', 'Cameron', 'imprint', 'clearly', 'production', 'mention', 'should', 'be', 'made', 'show', 'Vancouver', 'crew', 'obviously', 'lot', 'X-Files', 'veterans', 'production', 'values', 'Dark', 'Angel', 'are', 'pretty', 'striking', 'creating', 'seedy', 'world', 'post-pulse', 'Seattle', 'icon', 'Space', 'Needle', 'where', 'Max', 'go', 'contemplate', 'existence', 'sense', 'style', 'as', 'much', 'characters', 'setting', 'Alba', 'truly', 'stunning', 'Max', 'able', 'play', 'hard', 'soft', 'whatever', 'scene', 'demands', 'Weatherly', 'one', 'squarest', 'jaws', 'television', 'history', 'Savage', 'fun', 'milking', 'everything', 'bad', 'guy', 'really', 'care', 'children', 'duty', 'never', 'way', 'such', 'emotions', 'supporting', 'cast', 'compelling', 'texture', 'types', 'Normal', 'J.C.', 'MacKenzie', 'overbearing', 'dispatcher', 'Jam', 'Pony', 'Bip', 'Bip', 'Bip', 'urban', 'philosopher', 'Herbal', 'Thought', 'Alimi', 'Bllard', 'everybody', 'favorite', 'Original', 'Cindy', 'Valerie', 'Rae', 'Miller', 'Max', 'roommate', 'co-worker', 'who', 'basically', 'right', 'attitude', 'occasion.After', 'watching', 'complete', 'first', 'season', 'Dark', 'Angel', 'will', 'want', 'move', 'complete', 'second', 'season', 'just', 'came', 'out', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'were', 'only', 'two', 'seasons', 'series', 'However', 'when', 'see', 'overall', 'drop', 'quality', 'season', 'two', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'surprised', 'half', 'second', 'season', 'series', 'really', 'get', 'going', 'Dark', 'Angel', 'one', 'better', 'science', 'fiction', 'series', 'be', 'produced', 'last', 'ten', 'years', 'first', 'season', 'provide', 'complete', 'story', 'arc']",N/A

601638,A2T7TZBOTP68C7,B00005JLJM,"L. Mintah ""Author of the Heart""","[2, 3]","I had the good fortune to see every episode of Dark Angel Season One and Two on FOX when it aired in 2000 and 2001.  The previews were intriguing: a pretty young girl dressed in black standing on top of a roof with the moon in the background.  ""From the director of The Terminator,"" said the previews.  Cheesy . . . Cheesy . . . said my mind.  But once I started watching, I was hooked.  Dark Angel is intelligent, thought-provoking fare.  I will say this now rather than at the end of my review:  It is a crying shame this series was cancelled for a cowboy-space show called ""Firefly,"" which did not last a season.Beautiful in a conventional way, yet also in a way that speaks to feminist values and girl power, Jessica Alba plays Max.  Max is a genetically-engineered human trying to blend in with society after she escapes from her creators, a sinister agancy called Manticorp.  Manticorp is named after the mythological creature called the Manticore.  The society Max lives in is post-computers-crashing everything.  The government is totalitarian. Society is corrupt and decaying The lone voice of free speech and dissent is a young man in a wheelchair who broadcasts intermittently by asserting control of TV airwaves.  His name is Logan Cale (Michael Wetherfield)  He only shows his eyes as he speaks, and is known as ""Eyes Only.""  Logan has money, but is frustrated by his physical helplessness.Max gets entangled with Logan by accident.  Slowly but surely she enlists in his cause.  And the two begin to fall in love.  Yet, they are unable to consummate it physically, for an intriguing reason.Lots of interesting characters make Dark Angel rich.  Max's boss Normal (J.C. Mackenzie) is hilarious as the uptight guy trying to keep order in a chaotic world.  Normal's relaxed employees aggravate him.  Original Cindy (Valerie Rae Miller) is Max's lesbian roomate.  Cindy is urban sweet, and one of Max's truest friends.  Perhaps the most fascinating and complex character is Lydecker (Jack Savage), a tough Manticorp drill sargeant.  Lydecker seems to genuinely care for his young super soldiers, albeit in a perverse way.  Lydecker wants the kids to grow up tough, resourceful and self-sufficient, so they can take care of themselves in a chaotic world.

I think I started a little too far off into the series so I got confused what the hell they were talking bout. So I bought the DVD for a reasonable price, and I gotta say it is a compelling and well done series. My main reason I was wathcing the series was because Jessica Alba was in it, but now that I got into it, I like the series overall. The first episode was a 2-hour long episode kind of like a movie just basically explaining the main character Max (Jessica Alba) and the kind of person she was and now is. She is a genetically enhanced or ""Transgenic"" human being that was training to be the perfect soldier with other kids her age in a Training Lab Facility called ""Manticore"". The way Max and the other kids were handeled were brutal kind of like the way you would train a dog except worst. So Max and her ""bros & sisters"" one day escaped from Manticore hoping to live a better life. So it is the year 2019 in Seattle, Washington and Max is living a better life but at the same time living her past trying to find the rest of her brothers and sisters that escaped mainly her brother Zac that is the main leader.I just like the way they delivered this series and the certain tone they give as well, you can call this a Drama/Sci-Fi/Action with some comedic humor here and there. The series is really compelling altough the action fight sequences are not exactly the best, sometimes the acting is a little fake especially when Jessica speaks a little ebonix ethnic type thing. The cast feels real and you can connect to what there feeling most of the time, theres really no one better than Jessica Alba that could have had this part. So there are only two things that would really catch your attention and force you to buy this, #1 - if you like well done Sci-Fi series that are well done and can really compell you into the story. #2 -  if you are a guy (like me) that completly loves Jessica Alba cuz she is so god damn fine.

The James Cameron project Dark Angel being one of them. I was a big fan of the show from the beginning. I was 13 at the time and not a sci-fi fan in the least, but something about the characters and how well the show flowed got me hooked.Jessica Alba is Max Guevara, a genetically enhanced (not a cyborg or any other type of machine) girl who escapes from a secret government owned and run breeding/super-soldier training institution called Manticore. Max (X5-452) was a member of the X-5 series (previous X series were unsuccessful) and along with her ""brothers and sisters"" (other X-5 kids) were exposed to nightmarish experiments and brutal warfare training, but eventually made the decision to make a break for it. The first 5 minutes or so of the pilot episode chronicles their great escape. Max and eleven of her siblings successfully escape, but are separated from each other. A few months later, a terrorist activated electromagnetic pulse (simply called The Pulse) hits and turns the US into a virtual third world country. All technology is destroyed and chaos abounds. Because of this, Max is able to slip into the real world unnoticed.The rest of the show picks up a decade later and Max is living in Seattle working as a bike messenger at Jam Pony. She enjoys being a regular girl and chillin' with her friends. Her best friend is the always sassy, ""tell it like it is"" black lesbian Original Cindy (Valarie Rae Miller). Cindy's always got her back and some of the funniest lines in the series. Max squats with another close girlfriend Kendra (Jennifer Blanc) who is quite hetero and always on the prowl. Her other friends are the stoner with a heart of gold Sketchy (Richard Gunn) and the always optimistic Jamacian mon Herbal Thought (Alimi Ballard). Her ultra-conservative, always grouchy boss Reagan Ronald aka Normal (he's the most normal out of the group hence the nickname) is always on her back with some snarky lines.While Max's daytime life is pretty normal, her nighttime activities are anything but. She moonlights as a cat burglar to pay for the expensive funds helping her track down her missing siblings. One night after breaking into the apartment of Logan Cale (Michael Weatherly), she's caught by the man of the house himself and the two soon strike up a business relationship. Apparently, Logan did his research and found out about Max's Manticore past. The barcode on the back of her neck was a dead giveaway (did I mention the barcode?). In exchange for helping Max find her siblings, she has to help Logan solve his mysteries. See, Logan is really the cyber journalist ""Eyes Only"" who hacks into cable feeds to spread the truths of the corrupt political society of not only Seattle, but America in under 60 seconds. Max agrees and the first season officially begins.Oh yeah, Logan also has to protect Max from Lydecker (John Savage), her former Manticore trainer. He's been searching for ""the kids"" as he calls them for all the ten years they've been gone and he'll stop at nothing to get them back. To give a quick runthrough of the first season, a love affair ensues between Logan and Max (you so knew that was gonna happen), Max is able to find some of her siblings, and she manages to confront Lydecker (he's one cold dude) and attempts to take down Manticore in one of the most exciting finales I've seen.Although Jessica Alba isn't one of the best actresses out there, she's tailor made for the role of Max. Especially the fine line she walks between being a hard ass and allowing herself to be vulnerable. If she's sad, she'll let it out without going the overdramatic route. She's also witty and a smartass and the progression of her relationship with Logan is intriguing. Some might be put off by Original Cindy's character. Although she looks like a hood version of Scary Spice while dropping outdated slang like ""scrilla"", ""dealio"", and ""steelo"", there's much more to her, thanks to Valarie Miller's portrayal.

601652,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00005JLJM,Robert Moore,"[43, 50]","I only recently have given DARK ANGEL a try after long avoiding it. Why did I avoid it? I had seen a couple of episodes, and Jessica Alba struck me as excruciatingly beautiful on the one hand, but not terribly talented as an actress on the other, with a flat, uninflected delivery and not as much screen presence as other &quot;girl power&quot; actresses like Sarah Michelle Gellar, Eliza Dushku, or Jennifer Garner. I am still not a huge fan of Ms. Alba as an actress, but I have come to enjoy her character a lot more than I thought I would, and I have come to appreciate what a superb production the show is as a whole.Of all the TV shows that have arisen in the aftermath of the girl power unleashed by BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, this show and ALIAS have been perhaps the two most successful. While neither of these show possess the brilliance of BUFFY and its incredible stable of writers (some of whom are now, however, moving over to ALIAS with the demise of ANGEL), DARK ANGEL is remarkable for its extraordinary production values, talented supporting cast, and superb sets and art design. With the increasing predominance of reality shows and their miniscule budgets, costly shows like DARK ANGEL are going to become endangered entities until the fad for reality TV finally passes. DARK ANGEL is remarkable for its camera work, for the large number of set ups they make for each episode, for the convincing and compelling sets for each episode (they manage to make post-pulse Seattle as slovenly and unattractive as the makers of ANGEL were able to make Los Angeles look unglamorous and dark). This is an especially ambitious film, with a host of sets and characters and a complex overall story that they manage to tell with an exceedingly high degree of professionalism.I love long story arcs. It is one of the things that have made shows like THE X-FILES, BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, ANGEL, and FARSCAPE so fascinating to watch. Almost every episode of DARK ANGEL manages to tell a self-contained story, but also carry forward the larger narrative. The scripts are consistently strong and the writers gifted, though in the end the show lacks the deep interpersonal complexity and the crackling dialogue of BUFFY.I have come to like Jessica Alba more than I would ever have thought possible. She is not a great actress, and it is true that her voice lacks power or the ability to express nuance, but she overall does a competent job and manages to be more than just a beautiful face. She is, however, above all a beautiful face, with lips that rival those of Michelle Pfeiffer and Angelina Jolie for the most excruciatingly gorgeous in the world. She is also a very athletic actress. As much as I loved BUFFY, and as much as I respected Sarah Michelle Gellar for how enormously she developed as a martial artist in her seven years on the show (compare her fight scenes in Season One with those in Season Five, Six, or Seven), she always managed to &quot;run like a girl.&quot; At her best she managed short, choppy strides with arms tucked tightly into her body. Jessica Alba, however, when she runs, looks like a track athlete. She has a long, reaching stride, and pumps her arms vigorously, just as they teach in track. If she doesn't take over scenes in quite the way that Sarah Michelle or Eliza Dushku or Jennifer Garner or Claudia Black might, she nonetheless is a exquisitely beautiful, pleasant, athletic presence.It is unfortunately easy to understand why this show was cancelled. The networks are enamored of reality TV shows. They are incredibly cheap to produce; they pull in large audiences. Shows like DARK ANGEL, which are immeasurably better than any reality show, are, on the other hand, expensive to produce, take a lot of work to make, and challenge audiences with their long story lines. As a result, we got only two seasons of this superb show. We should have gotten many. It is definitely our loss.",5,A surprisingly good entry into the &quot;Girl Power&quot; Genre,1090886400,"07 27, 2004",2004,3927,"['only', 'recently', 'have', 'given', 'DARK', 'ANGEL', 'try', 'long', 'avoiding', 'Why', 'did', 'avoid', 'had', 'seen', 'couple', 'episodes', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'struck', 'excruciatingly', 'beautiful', 'one', 'hand', 'not', 'terribly', 'talented', 'actress', 'other', 'flat', 'uninflected', 'delivery', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'screen', 'presence', 'other', 'quot', 'power', 'quot', 'actresses', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'am', 'still', 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'Ms.', 'Alba', 'actress', 'have', 'come', 'enjoy', 'character', 'lot', 'more', 'thought', 'would', 'have', 'come', 'appreciate', 'what', 'superb', 'production', 'show', 'whole.Of', 'TV', 'have', 'arisen', 'aftermath', 'girl', 'power', 'unleashed', 'BUFFY', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'SLAYER', 'show', 'ALIAS', 'have', 'been', 'perhaps', 'two', 'most', 'successful', 'show', 'possess', 'brilliance', 'BUFFY', 'incredible', 'stable', 'writers', 'whom', 'are', 'now', 'however', 'moving', 'ALIAS', 'demise', 'ANGEL', 'DARK', 'ANGEL', 'remarkable', 'extraordinary', 'production', 'values', 'talented', 'supporting', 'cast', 'superb', 'sets', 'art', 'design', 'increasing', 'predominance', 'reality', 'shows', 'miniscule', 'budgets', 'costly', 'shows', 'DARK', 'ANGEL', 'are', 'going', 'become', 'endangered', 'entities', 'fad', 'reality', 'TV', 'finally', 'DARK', 'ANGEL', 'remarkable', 'camera', 'work', 'large', 'number', 'set', 'ups', 'make', 'episode', 'convincing', 'compelling', 'sets', 'episode', 'manage', 'make', 'post-pulse', 'Seattle', 'slovenly', 'unattractive', 'makers', 'ANGEL', 'were', 'able', 'make', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'look', 'unglamorous', 'dark', 'especially', 'ambitious', 'film', 'host', 'sets', 'characters', 'complex', 'overall', 'story', 'manage', 'tell', 'exceedingly', 'high', 'degree', 'professionalism.I', 'love', 'long', 'story', 'arcs', 'one', 'things', 'have', 'made', 'shows', 'X-FILES', 'BUFFY', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'SLAYER', 'ANGEL', 'FARSCAPE', 'so', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'Almost', 'episode', 'DARK', 'ANGEL', 'tell', 'self-contained', 'story', 'also', 'carry', 'forward', 'larger', 'narrative', 'scripts', 'are', 'consistently', 'strong', 'writers', 'gifted', 'end', 'show', 'deep', 'interpersonal', 'complexity', 'crackling', 'dialogue', 'BUFFY.I', 'have', 'come', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'more', 'would', 'ever', 'have', 'thought', 'possible', 'not', 'great', 'actress', 'true', 'voice', 'power', 'ability', 'express', 'nuance', 'overall', 'competent', 'job', 'manages', 'be', 'more', 'just', 'beautiful', 'face', 'however', 'beautiful', 'face', 'lips', 'rival', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'most', 'excruciatingly', 'gorgeous', 'world', 'also', 'very', 'athletic', 'actress', 'As', 'much', 'loved', 'BUFFY', 'as', 'much', 'respected', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'how', 'enormously', 'developed', 'martial', 'artist', 'seven', 'years', 'show', 'compare', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Season', 'One', 'Season', 'Five', 'Six', 'Seven', 'always', 'managed', 'quot', 'run', 'girl.', 'quot', 'best', 'managed', 'short', 'choppy', 'strides', 'arms', 'tucked', 'tightly', 'body', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'however', 'when', 'track', 'athlete', 'long', 'reaching', 'stride', 'arms', 'vigorously', 'just', 'teach', 'track', ""n't"", 'take', 'over', 'scenes', 'quite', 'way', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'Claudia', 'Black', 'might', 'nonetheless', 'exquisitely', 'beautiful', 'pleasant', 'athletic', 'presence.It', 'unfortunately', 'easy', 'understand', 'why', 'show', 'was', 'cancelled', 'networks', 'are', 'enamored', 'reality', 'TV', 'shows', 'are', 'incredibly', 'cheap', 'produce', 'pull', 'large', 'audiences', 'Shows', 'DARK', 'ANGEL', 'are', 'immeasurably', 'better', 'reality', 'show', 'are', 'other', 'hand', 'expensive', 'produce', 'take', 'lot', 'work', 'make', 'challenge', 'audiences', 'long', 'story', 'lines', 'result', 'got', 'only', 'two', 'seasons', 'superb', 'show', 'should', 'have', 'gotten', 'many', 'definitely', 'loss']",N/A

Every since they got out, Manicore, the government agency responsible for making her, has been after her.  Max survives by staying low and occassionally stealing items to sell.

Granted, the second season isn't quite as good, but Friday nights are notoriously bad nights for television.  And sure enough, the ratings took a swan dive.  And once again, a promising hit show found itself left behind by a major network who is more concerned about ratings than anything else.  I truly wish that this show had been on WB as it would probably still be running now.I love Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but of all the shows the depict the enhanced woman kicking ass, Dark Angel is my favorite.  Jessica Alba really makes Max her own.  Right from the Pilot episode, she quickly demonstrates that she knows who Max is and how to play her.  Aside from doing most of her own stunts and learning some martial arts skills, she gives Max much credibility as the tough renegade genetically-enhanded ""thief"" with a soft center.If Dark Angel has a weakness, it's in most of the supporting characters.  Aside from ""Original"" Cindy, the other characters of Sketchy, Normal, and other Jam Pony members aren't able to bring enough to their characters to make them interesting enough to follow.The writers quickly pin-point the meat of the story in Max and Logan.  Max, trying to find out about her past and her ""brothers"" and ""sisters"" as well as keeping Logan close by as it's obvious she is developing feelings for him.  And then Logan who is trying to use his money and power to set the world to rights as well as developing his feelings for Max.Finally, there is Lydecker, the man responsible for ""creating"" Max and the rest of the genetically enhanced children.  John Savage plays him beautifully.  Initially, we find him to be a definite villain, but later on, we find that he, too, is caught up in the conspiracy; that as much power as he wields, there are those with much more.James Cameron had a great idea when he put this show together.  Set in the future when the United States has become a third-world power, he creates a perfect backdrop for an unlikely hero trying to comes to grips with her past, her friends, her love life, and ultimately, with her self.",5,"Cameron's Dark Angel kicks ""Max"" butt",1119225600,"06 20, 2005",2005,2218,"['Nothing', 'struck', 'more', 'horror', 'when', 'Fox', 'announced', 'was', 'moving', 'Dark', 'Angel', 'Tuesday', 'nights', 'Friday', 'nights', 'second', 'season', 'Granted', 'second', 'season', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'Friday', 'nights', 'are', 'notoriously', 'bad', 'nights', 'television', 'sure', 'enough', 'ratings', 'took', 'swan', 'dive', 'once', 'again', 'promising', 'hit', 'show', 'found', 'left', 'behind', 'major', 'network', 'who', 'more', 'concerned', 'ratings', 'anything', 'else', 'truly', 'wish', 'show', 'had', 'been', 'WB', 'would', 'probably', 'still', 'be', 'running', 'now.I', 'love', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'shows', 'depict', 'enhanced', 'woman', 'kicking', 'ass', 'Dark', 'Angel', 'favorite', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'really', 'Max', 'own', 'Right', 'Pilot', 'episode', 'quickly', 'who', 'Max', 'how', 'play', 'Aside', 'doing', 'most', 'own', 'stunts', 'learning', 'martial', 'arts', 'skills', 'Max', 'much', 'credibility', 'tough', 'renegade', 'genetically-enhanded', 'thief', 'soft', 'center.If', 'Dark', 'Angel', 'weakness', 'most', 'supporting', 'characters', 'Aside', 'Original', 'Cindy', 'other', 'characters', 'Sketchy', 'Normal', 'other', 'Jam', 'Pony', 'members', 'are', ""n't"", 'able', 'bring', 'enough', 'characters', 'make', 'interesting', 'enough', 'follow.The', 'writers', 'quickly', 'pin-point', 'meat', 'story', 'Max', 'Logan', 'Max', 'trying', 'find', 'out', 'past', 'brothers', 'sisters', 'as', 'well', 'keeping', 'Logan', 'close', 'obvious', 'developing', 'feelings', 'then', 'Logan', 'who', 'trying', 'use', 'money', 'power', 'set', 'world', 'rights', 'as', 'well', 'developing', 'feelings', 'Max.Finally', 'Lydecker', 'man', 'responsible', 'creating', 'Max', 'rest', 'genetically', 'enhanced', 'children', 'John', 'Savage', 'beautifully', 'Initially', 'find', 'be', 'definite', 'villain', 'later', 'find', 'too', 'caught', 'up', 'conspiracy', 'as', 'much', 'power', 'are', 'much', 'more.James', 'Cameron', 'had', 'great', 'idea', 'when', 'put', 'show', 'together', 'Set', 'future', 'when', 'United', 'States', 'become', 'third-world', 'power', 'perfect', 'backdrop', 'unlikely', 'hero', 'trying', 'grips', 'past', 'friends', 'love', 'life', 'ultimately', 'self']",N/A

While I enjoyed the concept of dark angel I found Alba's acting rather poor. Perhaps because she seems a little young for the roll. She pouts, primps, and wisecracks her way through various encounters- but the character just strains credibility. Perhaps with an actress with more talent and a few more years under her belt this role would feel natural. As it is, seeing Alba strike seductive poses and try to seduce nefarious badguys doesn't quite work for this viewer. The acting is alternatively wooden, cheesy, and overdone.What shines in this series is the plot, and the side characters.

""PILUM THROWER!""","[33, 35]","The series is set two decades in the future from 2009-2019 in Seattle, Washington, & stars the uniquely beautiful Jessica Alba. One of the refreshing things is that the main character is a brooding beauty who rarely smiles, rather than the stereotypical fake smiling or hysterical heroins that pollute so many series.Jessica Alba is very believable in her torment. Her character sprang from a military genetic experiment called ""Project Manticore"" where kids were genetically altered to be super-human fighters & they were kept as prisoners in their training school. In their early teens the kids rebel & a few escape. Soon terrorists set off an electro magnetic pulse bomb that wipes out all debt & personal information, this clearly helps her to disappear. Her former captors pursue her obsessively as corruption runs wild in this highly chaotic society that in some ways has regressed into a third world country.Meanwhile, a rogue underground news network regularly hacks into the government networks to inform the public of various conspiracy theories. Alba's love interest Michael Weatherley comes from this group. Dark Angel mixes several different genre's of storytelling{ part The Fugitive & part Outer Limits} that makes for a somewhat slow, but still entertaining series.

So starts a strange friendship: Max is a mutant super-soldier on the run from the secret Manticore base, while Logan is a rich playboy who just happens to be ""Eyes Only"", intent on bringing the bad guys to justice. Logan gradually gets Max to realise she can help people too. But the danger of being caught by Manticore is never far away.This is fun, in a grungy, post-apocalyptic sort of way.

601667,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B00005JLJM,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[9, 9]","Dark Angel has many of its Cameronisms in place with the first episode: a strong female lead; unusual plot involving some element of science fiction; clever bits of dialogue uttered at the most inappropriate moment and a strong, lean visual style. I never caught the program when it was first run on Fox so can't comment on the advertising or scheduling of the program. The pilot episode comes on strong and, with each succeeding episode, some of that power is displayed to some degree. It seems to me this mixture of The Fugative and Blade Runner should have been conceived as a short series (a la The Prisoner). The premise didn't quite seem to be large enough to run for 5 or even 10 years (another example of this is The X-Files where Chris Carter should have pulled the plug after season 5). Regardless, Cameron's series (created with Charles Eglee)is visually stunning and an interesting show.Max (Jessica Alba)is a genetically engineered weapon. She, along with a number of other children, were created as the next generation in human soliders through genetic experimentation. Max and 12 other children escaped from the military facility where they had been conceived and raised but, unfortunately, all of them have scattered and disappeared. Max is a reluctant superhero; she wants to find the other children and discover her past in order to uncover who she really is.She teams up with Logan Cale (Michael Weatherly)a wealthy computer hacker who provides information on immoral acts against humanity via his Eyes Only web/television casts. Cale provides information as he uncovers it about her past and she, in turn, helps him get rid of those who victimize the less fortunate.Unfortunately, Max is being pursued by the head of Project Manitcore a government operative named Lydecker (well played by John Savage). Lydecker's goal is to discover the whereabouts of the 12 escaped children and terminate them before they expose and and his operation.Although Cameron only had hands on involvement with the pilot, his fingerprints are on most of the episodes of the first season. The series has a number of interesting twists during the first season and a stellar writing/producing team (including one former Next Generation/Deep Space Nine alum). The production values, sharp writing and direction mark Dark Angel as a cut above your average television program. It's clear that Cameron and co-creator Eglee had a nice, long story arc prepared for the show. Unforuntately, Fox cancelled the program after it's second season leaving many fans hanging as to the conclusion of the series (something Fox seems adept at doing lately).The DVD transfer looks very good although there are compression artifacts in most of the episodes. These are most noticeable on those episodes set at night or with a darker look to them. The sound is well above aveage. Unless you're particularly picky you probably won't notice these minor flaws. The commentaries, featurettes and gag reel are all nice additions to this terrific boxed set. Sadly, the packaging leaves something to be desired as its in the horrid accordion box style that seems so popular of late.There's a previous review here that states that there's a number of inappropriate lines delivered particularly one where Jessica Alba as Max makes a comment about guys being the weaker sex to a widow after her spouse has died. Actually, that's not quite accurate. The character happens to be one of Max's best friends and she makes the comment to her friend's husband when he's sick to help lighten her mood a bit. There aren't any pithy comments made when the character eventually dies. Instead, her character tries to comfort his widow. This inaccuracy creates a false impression of the type of show Dark Angel is and the type of characters that populate it.A lot of creative energy went into making Dark Angel an interesting show combing the conspiracy elements of programs like The X-Files without apeing them. What made Dark Angel most interesting and unique was a heroine who was trying to discover where she came from but didn't set out to be a &quot;superhero&quot;. She ends up becoming a reluctant hero at first and that very quality makes Max interesting and compelling as a character. She falls into her line of work of helping others.Although there were elements of the show that weren't as well developed during its first season as could have been, that's to be expected. The first season of any show sets up the ground rules of the series. We'll never know what potential Dark Angel had simply because the series was pulled before it ever really had a chance to take flight.",4,Promising series never given chance to take flight,1071964800,"12 21, 2003",2003,4638,"['Dark', 'Angel', 'many', 'Cameronisms', 'place', 'first', 'episode', 'strong', 'female', 'lead', 'unusual', 'plot', 'involving', 'element', 'science', 'fiction', 'bits', 'dialogue', 'uttered', 'most', 'inappropriate', 'moment', 'strong', 'lean', 'visual', 'style', 'never', 'caught', 'program', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'run', 'Fox', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'comment', 'advertising', 'scheduling', 'program', 'pilot', 'episode', 'strong', 'succeeding', 'episode', 'power', 'displayed', 'degree', 'mixture', 'Fugative', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'conceived', 'short', 'series', 'la', 'Prisoner', 'premise', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'seem', 'be', 'large', 'enough', 'run', '5', 'even', '10', 'years', 'example', 'X-Files', 'where', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'should', 'have', 'pulled', 'plug', 'season', '5', 'Regardless', 'Cameron', 'series', 'created', 'Charles', 'Eglee', 'visually', 'stunning', 'interesting', 'show.Max', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'genetically', 'engineered', 'weapon', 'number', 'other', 'children', 'were', 'created', 'next', 'generation', 'human', 'soliders', 'genetic', 'experimentation', 'Max', '12', 'other', 'children', 'escaped', 'military', 'facility', 'where', 'had', 'been', 'conceived', 'raised', 'unfortunately', 'have', 'scattered', 'disappeared', 'Max', 'reluctant', 'superhero', 'find', 'other', 'children', 'discover', 'past', 'order', 'uncover', 'who', 'really', 'is.She', 'teams', 'up', 'Logan', 'Cale', 'Michael', 'Weatherly', 'wealthy', 'computer', 'hacker', 'who', 'information', 'immoral', 'acts', 'humanity', 'Eyes', 'Only', 'web/television', 'casts', 'Cale', 'information', 'past', 'turn', 'get', 'rid', 'who', 'victimize', 'less', 'fortunate.Unfortunately', 'Max', 'being', 'pursued', 'head', 'Project', 'Manitcore', 'government', 'operative', 'named', 'Lydecker', 'well', 'played', 'John', 'Savage', 'Lydecker', 'goal', 'discover', 'whereabouts', '12', 'escaped', 'children', 'terminate', 'expose', 'operation.Although', 'Cameron', 'only', 'had', 'hands', 'involvement', 'pilot', 'fingerprints', 'are', 'most', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'series', 'number', 'interesting', 'twists', 'first', 'season', 'stellar', 'writing/producing', 'team', 'including', 'one', 'former', 'Next', 'Generation/Deep', 'Space', 'Nine', 'alum', 'production', 'values', 'sharp', 'writing', 'direction', 'mark', 'Dark', 'Angel', 'cut', 'average', 'television', 'program', 'clear', 'Cameron', 'co-creator', 'Eglee', 'had', 'nice', 'long', 'story', 'arc', 'prepared', 'show', 'Unforuntately', 'Fox', 'cancelled', 'program', 'second', 'season', 'leaving', 'many', 'fans', 'hanging', 'conclusion', 'series', 'something', 'Fox', 'adept', 'doing', 'lately', '.The', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'very', 'good', 'are', 'compression', 'artifacts', 'most', 'episodes', 'are', 'most', 'noticeable', 'episodes', 'set', 'night', 'darker', 'look', 'sound', 'well', 'above', 'aveage', ""'re"", 'particularly', 'picky', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'notice', 'minor', 'flaws', 'commentaries', 'featurettes', 'gag', 'reel', 'are', 'nice', 'additions', 'terrific', 'boxed', 'set', 'Sadly', 'packaging', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'horrid', 'accordion', 'box', 'style', 'so', 'popular', 'previous', 'review', 'here', 'number', 'inappropriate', 'lines', 'delivered', 'particularly', 'one', 'where', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'Max', 'comment', 'guys', 'being', 'weaker', 'sex', 'widow', 'spouse', 'died', 'Actually', 'not', 'quite', 'accurate', 'character', 'be', 'one', 'Max', 'best', 'friends', 'comment', 'friend', 'husband', 'when', 'sick', 'help', 'lighten', 'mood', 'bit', 'are', ""n't"", 'pithy', 'comments', 'made', 'when', 'character', 'eventually', 'Instead', 'character', 'tries', 'comfort', 'widow', 'inaccuracy', 'false', 'impression', 'type', 'show', 'Dark', 'Angel', 'type', 'characters', 'populate', 'it.A', 'lot', 'creative', 'energy', 'went', 'making', 'Dark', 'Angel', 'interesting', 'show', 'combing', 'conspiracy', 'elements', 'programs', 'X-Files', 'apeing', 'What', 'made', 'Dark', 'Angel', 'most', 'interesting', 'unique', 'was', 'heroine', 'who', 'was', 'trying', 'discover', 'where', 'came', 'did', ""n't"", 'set', 'out', 'be', 'quot', 'quot', 'up', 'becoming', 'reluctant', 'hero', 'first', 'very', 'quality', 'Max', 'interesting', 'compelling', 'character', 'line', 'work', 'helping', 'were', 'elements', 'show', 'were', ""n't"", 'as', 'well', 'developed', 'first', 'season', 'as', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'be', 'expected', 'first', 'season', 'show', 'up', 'ground', 'rules', 'series', ""'ll"", 'never', 'know', 'what', 'potential', 'Dark', 'Angel', 'had', 'simply', 'series', 'was', 'pulled', 'ever', 'really', 'had', 'chance', 'take', 'flight']",N/A
