66338,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,0783235674,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 1]","(The copy I recently purchased of this videotape has a decent picture and clear HiFi audio.)FAMILY PLOT is often hard to stay involved with because of a lack of sympathetic characters. It's further hampered by clumsily executed humor and Alfred Hitchcock's too-numerous crane shots. Lastly, leading man Bruce Dern's hamminess, his coarsely overmodulated petulance and frequent cursing are poor substitutes for Cary Grant's timeless urbanity in such Hitchcock efforts asSUSPICION(1944),NORTH BY NORTHWEST(1959),NOTORIOUS(1946) andTO CATCH A THIEF(1955).SYNOPSISA phony spiritualist (Harris) and her ill-tempered taxi-driving/out-of-work actor boyfriend aim for a 10K payday from an elderly millionairess. To secure this windfall they must locate the old gal's nephew, who has vanished since his adoption as an infant. Investigations bring the unwitting flim-flammers into contact with a dangerously felonious couple (Devane and Black) who finance their upscale jewelry business by kidnapping San Fran big shots.In one scene, Hitch employs a ""brakes don't work!"" scare that is nowhere near as effective as the forcibly-inebriated Roger Thornhill (Grant) wildly careening in a sabotaged auto down a precarious mountain road in ""North by Northwest.""It's doubtful that the Master of Suspense could mar his substantial legacy by attempting to ""get with the times"" in this, his last picture, yet ""Family Plot"" is a most forgettable cinematic goodbye.  Recommendation: stick with any number of Hitch's genuine classics.

He was overweight, was getting old and had a pacemaker implanted. Despite these health issues, he wanted to make one last film before he died. Fast forward a few months later. Hitchcock's last film, ""Family Plot"", was released. While not as great as ""Pyscho"" or ""Vertigo"", it still manages to hold its own against Hitchcock's best work.The lot of this film is, as may reviewers say, a very convoluted one. One deals with a faux pyschic (Barbara Harris) and her boyfriend (Bruce Dern) conning an old lady of her millions by pretendign to find her nephew (William Devane). Devane is a jeweler with a criminal edge, as he and his girlfriend (Karen Black) have abducted a wealthy Greek businessman and are holding him for ransom. Somehow, the lives of these four people collide and it results in one of Hitchcock's best movies. The ending is a great farewell to the Master Of Suspense.The extras on the dvd are extraordnary, probably the best on any Hitchcock dvd.

It carries a sub-theme with a ""mystic"" faking seances, which I found quite annoying. In addition, there is enough offensive language to irk anyone not deadened to such. Hitchcock no doubt takes a larger than typical-for-him step into humor, even farce, but the overall effort doesn't work in my view.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[2, 2]","&#34;Family Plot&#34; is usually only remembered for one thing: being the very last movie that the great Alfred Hitchcock directed.And that's a shame. While it's far from his greatest work, &#34;Family Plot&#34; is a charming little blend of suspense and comedy, with a quick wit and a clever, twisty little plot. But the greatest strength -- aside from the writing -- is the two pairs of sketchy lovers, one whom you root for and one whom you root vigorously against, working in parallel against each other.Fake psychic Blanche (Barbara Harris) is given a difficult task by the elderly, wealthy Julia Rainbird (Cathleen Nesbitt) -- find Julia's long-lost, illegitimate nephew, so she can make him her heir. If Blanche and her boyfriend George (Bruce Dern) can find him, Miss Rainbird will pay them $10,000. The only problem is that they don't know the child's name, his location, who adopted him, or even if he's alive.Well, he is. Having killed his adoptive parents and struck out on his own, he is now Arthur Adamson (William Devane), a successful jeweler. He and his girlfriend Fran (Karen Black) have a side business of kidnapping important and/or wealthy people, and demanding the ransom in valuable gems.So while George and Blanche snatch up whatever clues they can find about the former Rainbird child, Arthur and Fran are setting out on their latest kidnapping plot: a bishop that Arthur has a personal dislike for. But the whole deal is complicated when the kidnappers believe that George and Blanche know what they're doing... and having murdered before, Arthur's not opposed to doing it again.&#34;Family Plot&#34; is one of those movies that is often overlooked in a director's ouvre -- not a defining work (&#34;Psycho&#34;) or a misunderstood classic (&#34;Vertigo&#34;) or even just a sleek attention-grabber (&#34;North by Northwest&#34;). This is a smaller movie, with a clever blend of comedy and mystery that aspires to be nothing more than what it is.Hitchcock showed considerable skill in juggling the two plots even as he intertwined them together. On one hand, we have a fake psychic and an actor/taxi driver who are trying to find someone, snatching at little clues that thankfully lead to bigger ones. On the other, we have cold-blooded kidnappers/jewel thieves who believe that the other couple are on their trail. And they don't quite collide until the very end.And Hitchcock's screwy sense of humor permeates even the more serious scenes (Blanche turns out to be the worst person to be stuck with in an out-of-control car). He also gets a lot of humor from the scenes of fake psychic stuff -- long before Shawn Spencer, we had Blanche seeking spirits in the kitchen and raving about trees. Even the kidnapping has an oddly humorous air -- the churchgoers watch in befuddlement as the unconscious bishop is dragged out of the cathedral.All the actors do a pretty decent job here -- Harris and Dern have some nice sparky chemistry as a pair of lovers who use his detective skills and her manipulations to make a living. Devane is particularly good as the villain -- a charming psychopath who is skilled at getting others to do the dirty work for him, and smiles toothily as his eyes harden into flint.&#34;Family Plot&#34; is no &#34;Psycho,&#34; but it's a genuinely charming, fun little movie with that timeless Hitchcock touch -- and it leaves you a bit sad that this was the last one.",4,Plots and schemes,1393891200,"03 4, 2014",2014,3415,"['34', 'Family', 'Plot', '34', 'usually', 'only', 'remembered', 'one', 'thing', 'being', 'very', 'last', 'movie', 'great', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'directed.And', 'shame', 'far', 'greatest', 'work', '34', 'Family', 'Plot', '34', 'charming', 'little', 'blend', 'suspense', 'comedy', 'quick', 'wit', 'clever', 'twisty', 'little', 'plot', 'greatest', 'strength', 'aside', 'writing', 'two', 'pairs', 'sketchy', 'lovers', 'one', 'whom', 'root', 'one', 'whom', 'root', 'vigorously', 'working', 'parallel', 'other.Fake', 'psychic', 'Blanche', 'Barbara', 'Harris', 'given', 'difficult', 'task', 'elderly', 'wealthy', 'Julia', 'Rainbird', 'Cathleen', 'Nesbitt', 'find', 'Julia', 'long-lost', 'illegitimate', 'nephew', 'can', 'make', 'heir', 'Blanche', 'boyfriend', 'George', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'can', 'find', 'Miss', 'Rainbird', 'will', 'pay', '10,000', 'only', 'problem', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'child', 'name', 'location', 'who', 'adopted', 'even', 'alive.Well', 'Having', 'killed', 'adoptive', 'parents', 'struck', 'out', 'own', 'now', 'Arthur', 'Adamson', 'William', 'Devane', 'successful', 'jeweler', 'girlfriend', 'Fran', 'Karen', 'Black', 'have', 'side', 'business', 'kidnapping', 'important', 'and/or', 'wealthy', 'people', 'demanding', 'ransom', 'valuable', 'gems.So', 'George', 'Blanche', 'snatch', 'up', 'clues', 'can', 'find', 'former', 'Rainbird', 'child', 'Arthur', 'Fran', 'are', 'setting', 'out', 'latest', 'kidnapping', 'plot', 'bishop', 'Arthur', 'personal', 'dislike', 'whole', 'deal', 'complicated', 'when', 'kidnappers', 'believe', 'George', 'Blanche', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'having', 'murdered', 'Arthur', 'not', 'opposed', 'doing', 'again.', '34', 'Family', 'Plot', '34', 'one', 'movies', 'often', 'overlooked', 'director', 'ouvre', 'not', 'defining', 'work', '34', 'Psycho', '34', 'misunderstood', 'classic', '34', 'Vertigo', '34', 'even', 'just', 'sleek', 'attention-grabber', '34', 'North', 'Northwest', '34', 'smaller', 'movie', 'clever', 'blend', 'comedy', 'mystery', 'be', 'nothing', 'more', 'what', 'is.Hitchcock', 'showed', 'considerable', 'skill', 'juggling', 'two', 'plots', 'even', 'intertwined', 'together', 'one', 'hand', 'have', 'fake', 'psychic', 'actor/taxi', 'driver', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'find', 'someone', 'snatching', 'little', 'clues', 'thankfully', 'lead', 'bigger', 'ones', 'other', 'have', 'cold-blooded', 'kidnappers/jewel', 'thieves', 'who', 'believe', 'other', 'couple', 'are', 'trail', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'collide', 'very', 'end.And', 'Hitchcock', 'screwy', 'sense', 'humor', 'permeates', 'even', 'more', 'serious', 'scenes', 'Blanche', 'out', 'be', 'worst', 'person', 'be', 'stuck', 'out-of-control', 'car', 'also', 'lot', 'humor', 'scenes', 'fake', 'psychic', 'stuff', 'long', 'before', 'Shawn', 'Spencer', 'had', 'Blanche', 'seeking', 'spirits', 'kitchen', 'raving', 'trees', 'Even', 'kidnapping', 'oddly', 'humorous', 'air', 'churchgoers', 'watch', 'befuddlement', 'unconscious', 'bishop', 'dragged', 'cathedral.All', 'actors', 'do', 'pretty', 'decent', 'job', 'here', 'Harris', 'Dern', 'have', 'nice', 'sparky', 'chemistry', 'pair', 'lovers', 'who', 'use', 'detective', 'skills', 'manipulations', 'make', 'living', 'Devane', 'particularly', 'good', 'villain', 'charming', 'psychopath', 'who', 'skilled', 'getting', 'others', 'do', 'dirty', 'work', 'smiles', 'toothily', 'eyes', 'harden', 'flint.', '34', 'Family', 'Plot', '34', '34', 'Psycho', '34', 'genuinely', 'charming', 'fun', 'little', 'movie', 'timeless', 'Hitchcock', 'touch', 'bit', 'sad', 'was', 'last', 'one']",Family Plot VHS

If not for the performances of Barbara Harris as a phony psychic and Bruce Dern as her taxi driving-detective-boyfriend this film would have indeed lacked any hint of romanticism.

Stanford ""gregory__scott""","[12, 14]","As a child growing up I was consumed with a passion for film, which has continued to this day and one of my all time favorite directors of film is Alfred Hitchcock.The film Family Plot came was released in 1976 and for a young teenager growing up in Southern California, this was my first and only opportunity to see a Hitchcock film in it's initial release.The plot in this film is sort of silly in spots, it concerns a phony psychic who while working as a medium is hired to find a missing heir to her family's fortune. The only problem is that the missing heir is now a jewel thief who faked his own death years ago and wants no part of being located once again.Bruce Dern plays a cabbie who is also a boyfriend to the psychic, played by Barbara Harris, the jewel thief is played by William Devane, and Karen Black plays his accomplice/love interest.Mr Hitchcock on this film employed many of the people who had made his subsequent films so successful including screenwriter Ernest Lehman, who penned North By Northwest amongst others for Hitch, Edith Head multi Academy Award winning costume designer, as well as Henry Bumstead who handled the fabulous set designs.This DVD release is quite impressive for one of the least impressive films of Alfred Hitchcock, but the features make this a worthy addition to your collection nonetheless.The disc is released in anamorphically enhanced widescreen which is presented in it's original aspect ratio of 1:85.1 and looks vastly superior to the old LaserDisc and VHS copies of this film that I have viewed over the years.The soundtrack is presented in Dolby Digital 2.0 mono and the composer is John Williams in a subdued but effective score.There is a very nice documentary on this DVD as well entitled, &quot;Plotting Family Plot which runs a little under 50 minutes and covers just about the whole production of the film and has interviews with assisstant director Howard Kazanjian, set designer Henry Bumstead, and actors Bruce Dern, Karen Black, William Devane.There all also the standard addition of trailers two to be exact, as well as production photos and some behind the scenes photos as well.Overall Alfred Hitchcocks 54th and final film is not something that film historians will be citing as a milestone in his career, however I think that anyone who is a film collector or Hitchock fan should add this to their DVD collection.

Such a plot only happens in the USA, not to speak of California of course. No proper records of births and deaths. One can navigate from one identity to the next in a jiffy. But then imagine two sisters. The younger one gets pregnant out of wedlock. The family is a big name on the local urban stage. So the child had to disappear. It is adopted into anonymity by the chauffeur of the family. But no luck the kid with his local friend, and accomplice, set the house on fire, killing the two adoptive parents, and the child, but no one finds the body, but who cares? So he is considered dead though never officially recorded as such. He gets a new life under another name and becomes, who knows how but we can imagine, a rich jeweler. But to be rich is not enough. He has to get richer but by dangerous and exciting ways. So he becomes a professional abductor of rich people that he gives them back against big diamonds. A big professional first and then the bishop of the local city, Los Angeles probably, at least that's all we can see. The main character though is a psychic who is dealing with the older sister of before  who is going to die and she wants to clean up her plate, and her soul not to speak of her mind, before going into the ground. So she is managed into revealing her secret and the son of her sister has to be found. And the surprises are going to start there. Good luck and enjoy the rest of the film. Of course there will be a lot more innuendo, qui pro quo, salmagundi and baloney. And the prize will be so much more than the initial payment envisaged for finding a lost heir because of the two criminals and the latest two diamonds. Why did Alfred Hitchcock bother to produce such an entertaining little thriller at the end of his life? Because there is a tremendous amount of humor, like the rodeo or chase or crazy gig on the winding road in the mountains over Los Angeles, and they will manage to survive their dead brakes and the killing mechanic will end up in flames in the scenery. And the scenery is really beautiful. Humor in how a priest gets a rendezvous with his girl friend up in the mountains by taking four kids on a hike up there. And the poor taxi-driver cum private-eye cum chauffeur of the psychic cum savior of her cum catcher of the criminals is so funny in his multiple unpaid professions and his multiple perambulating over-exploitations by his own girl friend. And so many other funny little situations. But the film has another charm: it is the social irony and light sarcasm that Hitchcock aims at this hypocritical society of California and Los Angeles. Alfred Hitchcock was settling some accounts then with his adoptive country, without burning the house to kill the adoptive parents: they did not deserve that much. And of course he managed to get us lost and give us a complete vertigo with his favorite tricks of staircases going up and down, right and left, to and fro, front and back and even catty-corner and all around. It is of course a metaphor of the society he is depicting but it is also a representation of his inside and crooked mind. Stairs are an obsession in  that man and he is trying to entangle us into them to enslave us to their steps, to his steps, and we just can follow, enjoying each step and all the mezzanines between the flights, and fly we do, quite a lot indeed, with the perverted wings of that psycho psychic.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",5,Cemetery plot for anonymous survivor,1074902400,"01 24, 2004",2004,3672,"['nice', 'psychic', 'thriller', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'complete', 'pervert', 'everyone', 'knows', 'course', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'was', 'perfect', 'pervert', 'plot', 'only', 'USA', 'not', 'speak', 'California', 'course', 'proper', 'records', 'births', 'deaths', 'One', 'can', 'navigate', 'one', 'identity', 'next', 'jiffy', 'then', 'imagine', 'two', 'sisters', 'younger', 'one', 'pregnant', 'wedlock', 'family', 'big', 'name', 'local', 'urban', 'stage', 'child', 'had', 'disappear', 'adopted', 'anonymity', 'chauffeur', 'family', 'luck', 'kid', 'local', 'friend', 'accomplice', 'set', 'house', 'fire', 'killing', 'two', 'adoptive', 'parents', 'child', 'one', 'body', 'who', 'considered', 'dead', 'never', 'officially', 'recorded', 'such', 'new', 'life', 'name', 'becomes', 'who', 'how', 'can', 'imagine', 'rich', 'jeweler', 'be', 'rich', 'not', 'enough', 'get', 'richer', 'dangerous', 'exciting', 'ways', 'professional', 'abductor', 'rich', 'people', 'back', 'big', 'diamonds', 'big', 'professional', 'first', 'then', 'bishop', 'local', 'city', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'probably', 'least', 'can', 'see', 'main', 'character', 'though', 'psychic', 'who', 'dealing', 'older', 'sister', 'who', 'going', 'die', 'clean', 'up', 'plate', 'soul', 'not', 'speak', 'mind', 'going', 'ground', 'managed', 'revealing', 'secret', 'son', 'sister', 'be', 'found', 'surprises', 'are', 'going', 'start', 'there', 'Good', 'luck', 'enjoy', 'rest', 'film', 'course', 'will', 'be', 'lot', 'more', 'innuendo', 'qui', 'pro', 'quo', 'salmagundi', 'baloney', 'prize', 'will', 'be', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'initial', 'payment', 'envisaged', 'finding', 'lost', 'heir', 'two', 'criminals', 'latest', 'two', 'diamonds', 'Why', 'did', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'bother', 'produce', 'such', 'entertaining', 'little', 'thriller', 'end', 'life', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'humor', 'rodeo', 'chase', 'crazy', 'gig', 'winding', 'road', 'mountains', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'will', 'manage', 'survive', 'dead', 'brakes', 'killing', 'mechanic', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'flames', 'scenery', 'scenery', 'really', 'beautiful', 'Humor', 'how', 'priest', 'rendezvous', 'girl', 'friend', 'up', 'mountains', 'taking', 'four', 'kids', 'hike', 'up', 'there', 'poor', 'taxi-driver', 'cum', 'private-eye', 'cum', 'chauffeur', 'psychic', 'cum', 'savior', 'cum', 'catcher', 'criminals', 'so', 'funny', 'multiple', 'unpaid', 'professions', 'multiple', 'perambulating', 'over-exploitations', 'own', 'girl', 'friend', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'funny', 'little', 'situations', 'film', 'charm', 'social', 'irony', 'light', 'sarcasm', 'Hitchcock', 'hypocritical', 'society', 'California', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'was', 'settling', 'accounts', 'then', 'adoptive', 'country', 'burning', 'house', 'kill', 'adoptive', 'parents', 'did', 'not', 'deserve', 'much', 'course', 'managed', 'get', 'lost', 'give', 'complete', 'vertigo', 'favorite', 'tricks', 'staircases', 'going', 'up', 'down', 'right', 'left', 'fro', 'front', 'back', 'even', 'catty-corner', 'around', 'course', 'metaphor', 'society', 'depicting', 'also', 'representation', 'inside', 'crooked', 'mind', 'Stairs', 'are', 'obsession', 'man', 'trying', 'entangle', 'enslave', 'steps', 'steps', 'just', 'can', 'follow', 'enjoying', 'step', 'mezzanines', 'flights', 'fly', 'do', 'quite', 'lot', 'indeed', 'perverted', 'wings', 'psycho', 'psychic.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Versailles', 'Saint', 'Quentin', 'Yvelines']",Family Plot VHS

66364,ABX7SEE84DMLU,0783235674,John P Bernat,"[4, 5]","I think Hitchcock knew this would be his last film.  It's not his most innovative or even among the top ten most artful.He died some time after it was completed, although he had a heart pacemaker implanted during production.  Despite this capping the most distinguished single career in the history of movies, the movie carries some irresistably youthful elements.First, the audience is made to identify with two small-time crooks.  These are not admirable people;  their whole purpose is to defraud an old lady.  But they're so cute...Then, the person that they're supposed to find turns out to be a very smooth criminal himself, with no discernable scruples.  So, the classic Hitchcock ""transference of guilt"" can operate freely here.  Everybody's tainted somehow;  who is the most guilty?And finally, although Hitch was an exceptionally practical and down-to-earth person, it ends with a wink at whether psychic phenomena really exist.  He has Barbara Harris taking credit for something which, by appearance, was only possible via the use of her (apparently fake) psychic powers.  Harris breaks the fourth wall and winks directly at the camera.That scene still sends shivers down my well-worn spine, but for such a different reason.  The most brilliant filmmaker of the twentieth century, one who insisted on making a cameo appearance of some kind or another in each movie, uses an actress (one who should be treated like cattle) to communicate directly with us.

66365,A22BPC7LRSGSYQ,0783235674,Joker,"[1, 1]","For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  I just want to give a few thoughts on this Alfred Hitchcock movie...Family Plot (1976) was director Alfred Hitchcock's final movie in his long and storied career.  This movie is serious at times, funny at times, and is generally seen as a black comedy.  One of the strong points of this movie is the musical score by John Williams.  It's not overpowering or bombastic, but rather just right for this '70s movie.  The acting is pretty good as well, particularly by Bruce Dern and Karen Black.  I like anything that Karen Black is in.  Bruce Dern had a small role in another Hitchcock movie, Marnie (1964).  Another strong point of this movie is the driving sequence which reminds me of two other Hitchcock movies, To Catch A Thief (1955) and North By Northwest (1959).  Overall, this movie doesn't have quite the ""Hitchcock feel"" of his earlier classic movies from the '30s, '40's, '50s, and early '60s.  It has sort of a mid-1970's TV movie feel to it.  The suspense factor isn't as powerful as his earlier movies, either.  Also, this movie seems to swing back and forth from serious to funny, back and forth, back and forth.This is not a great movie, but it isn't bad, either.  It certainly does not rank amongst his best movies.  If you're new to Hitchcock's movies, if you've never seen one before, then I don't recommend watching Family Plot as your first Hitchcock movie.  Instead, I recommend hit movies such as Rebecca (1940), Shadow Of A Doubt (1943), Strangers On A Train (1951), Rear Window (1954), Vertigo (1958), North By Northwest (1959), Psycho (1960), The Birds (1963), Marnie (1964), and Frenzy (1972).",3,Family Plot - 1976,1351987200,"11 4, 2012",2012,1676,"['description', 'plot', 'etc.', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'just', 'want', 'give', 'few', 'thoughts', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'movie', 'Family', 'Plot', '1976', 'was', 'director', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'final', 'movie', 'long', 'storied', 'career', 'movie', 'serious', 'times', 'funny', 'times', 'generally', 'seen', 'black', 'comedy', 'One', 'strong', 'points', 'movie', 'musical', 'score', 'John', 'Williams', 'not', 'overpowering', 'bombastic', 'rather', 'just', 'right', ""'70s"", 'movie', 'acting', 'pretty', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'particularly', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'Karen', 'Black', 'anything', 'Karen', 'Black', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'had', 'small', 'role', 'Hitchcock', 'movie', 'Marnie', '1964', 'strong', 'point', 'movie', 'driving', 'sequence', 'two', 'other', 'Hitchcock', 'movies', 'Catch', 'A', 'Thief', '1955', 'North', 'Northwest', '1959', 'Overall', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'quite', 'Hitchcock', 'feel', 'earlier', 'classic', 'movies', ""'30s"", ""'40"", ""'50s"", 'early', ""'60s"", 'sort', 'mid-1970', 'TV', 'movie', 'feel', 'suspense', 'factor', ""n't"", 'as', 'powerful', 'earlier', 'movies', 'either', 'Also', 'movie', 'swing', 'back', 'forth', 'serious', 'funny', 'back', 'forth', 'back', 'forth.This', 'not', 'great', 'movie', ""n't"", 'bad', 'either', 'certainly', 'not', 'rank', 'best', 'movies', ""'re"", 'new', 'Hitchcock', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'one', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'watching', 'Family', 'Plot', 'first', 'Hitchcock', 'movie', 'Instead', 'recommend', 'hit', 'movies', 'such', 'Rebecca', '1940', 'Shadow', 'A', 'Doubt', '1943', 'Strangers', 'Train', '1951', 'Rear', 'Window', '1954', 'Vertigo', '1958', 'North', 'Northwest', '1959', 'Psycho', '1960', 'Birds', '1963', 'Marnie', '1964', 'Frenzy', '1972']",Family Plot VHS

He was in the planning stages of his next film when his poor health finally caught up with him and he gracefully retired.But while ""Family Plot"" is not up to the level of his greatest works, it is a very entertaining and enjoyable romp that I have watched around a dozen times. And it is just as fun to watch the first time as the 12th time.The plot is typical Hitchcock, two sets of couples who's lives are about to cross.  Yet the tone of the film is more wry comedy, rather than pure suspense. I will not give away all the details, suffice to say that this film has the feel of an old hand in charge.  Scenes flow with an ease that young directors can only dream of accomplishing.For this DVD the print has been remastered and it looks great.  A vast improvement over the grainy prints we've been delt with over the years which made this film look more like a tv movie of the week.Also included is a wonderful documentary detailing the experiences of this film complete with new interviews of Bruce Dern, William Devane, Composer John Williams, & Karen Black (who's career has mirrored Barbara Harris in some ways).  All three actors tell delightful stories about the making of the film and it comes as no shock that the best Hitchcock impression comes from Karen Black. Sadly, Barbara Harris is missing along with Katherine Helmond (of ""Soap"" & ""Who's the Boss"" fame), she has only one scene where she speaks, but she does deliver the most memorable visual of the film, the kicking over of the tombstone.Other DVD extras include storyboards for the car/mountain scene, production photos, & trailers that promoted the film.This is a very neat, very complete package for the DVD presentation of this film and I hope that the others in this series of ""Alfred Hitchcock Masterpiece"" Collection live up to the standard set with ""Family Plot"".Tidbits:- Hitchcock ""appears"" much later in the film (about 45 minutes in) that was typical for him.  After ""Notorious"", Hitch usually appeared quite early in films (like during the opening credits for ""North by Northwest"") because he found out that audiences sometimes missed plot points while waiting for him to appear.- The movie ""Dazed and Confused"", which is set in Texas in 1976, has ""Family Plot"" on the drive-in movie marquee seen early in the film.- The kidnap victim seen early in the film (and the subject of an extended interview by the FBI) is none other than Nicholas Colasanto, who later played ""Coach"" in the NBC comedy series ""Cheers"".- One nice side product of the improved print of the film is that it's quite clear that in the first ""kitchen"" scene with Karen Black (after they leave Mr. Colosanto at the golf course) that she is wearing nothing underneath her quite tight sweater.",5,A Final Bow from the Master,1146441600,"05 1, 2006",2006,2806,"['was', 'not', 'suppose', 'be', 'final', 'film', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'was', 'planning', 'stages', 'next', 'film', 'when', 'poor', 'health', 'finally', 'caught', 'up', 'gracefully', 'retired.But', 'Family', 'Plot', 'not', 'up', 'level', 'greatest', 'works', 'very', 'entertaining', 'enjoyable', 'romp', 'have', 'watched', 'dozen', 'times', 'just', 'as', 'fun', 'watch', 'first', 'time', '12th', 'time.The', 'plot', 'typical', 'Hitchcock', 'two', 'sets', 'couples', 'who', 'lives', 'are', 'cross', 'tone', 'film', 'more', 'wry', 'comedy', 'rather', 'pure', 'suspense', 'will', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'details', 'suffice', 'say', 'film', 'feel', 'old', 'hand', 'charge', 'Scenes', 'flow', 'ease', 'young', 'directors', 'can', 'only', 'dream', 'accomplishing.For', 'print', 'been', 'remastered', 'great', 'vast', 'improvement', 'grainy', 'prints', ""'ve"", 'been', 'delt', 'years', 'made', 'film', 'look', 'more', 'tv', 'movie', 'week.Also', 'included', 'wonderful', 'documentary', 'detailing', 'experiences', 'film', 'complete', 'new', 'interviews', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'William', 'Devane', 'Composer', 'John', 'Williams', 'Karen', 'Black', 'who', 'career', 'mirrored', 'Barbara', 'Harris', 'ways', 'three', 'actors', 'tell', 'delightful', 'stories', 'making', 'film', 'shock', 'best', 'Hitchcock', 'impression', 'Karen', 'Black', 'Sadly', 'Barbara', 'Harris', 'missing', 'along', 'Katherine', 'Helmond', 'Soap', 'Who', 'Boss', 'fame', 'only', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'deliver', 'most', 'memorable', 'visual', 'film', 'kicking', 'tombstone.Other', 'DVD', 'extras', 'include', 'storyboards', 'car/mountain', 'scene', 'production', 'photos', 'trailers', 'promoted', 'film.This', 'very', 'neat', 'very', 'complete', 'package', 'DVD', 'presentation', 'film', 'hope', 'others', 'series', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'Masterpiece', 'Collection', 'live', 'up', 'standard', 'set', 'Family', 'Plot', '.Tidbits', 'Hitchcock', 'much', 'later', 'film', '45', 'minutes', 'was', 'typical', 'Notorious', 'Hitch', 'usually', 'appeared', 'quite', 'early', 'films', 'opening', 'credits', 'North', 'Northwest', 'found', 'out', 'audiences', 'sometimes', 'missed', 'plot', 'points', 'waiting', 'appear.-', 'movie', 'Dazed', 'Confused', 'set', 'Texas', '1976', 'Family', 'Plot', 'drive-in', 'movie', 'marquee', 'seen', 'early', 'film.-', 'kidnap', 'victim', 'seen', 'early', 'film', 'subject', 'extended', 'interview', 'FBI', 'none', 'other', 'Nicholas', 'Colasanto', 'who', 'later', 'played', 'Coach', 'NBC', 'comedy', 'series', 'Cheers', '.-', 'One', 'nice', 'side', 'product', 'improved', 'print', 'film', 'quite', 'clear', 'first', 'kitchen', 'scene', 'Karen', 'Black', 'leave', 'Mr.', 'Colosanto', 'golf', 'course', 'wearing', 'nothing', 'quite', 'tight', 'sweater']",Family Plot VHS

It is the story of 2 couples whose chase of a dollar intersects in a typical Hitchcock way.Blanche Tyler (Barbara Harris) is a phony psychic who is working Mrs. Rainbird (Cathleen Nesbitt), an elderly widow.  The old woman confesses that her now departed sister had a son who was whisked off into the unknown shortly after he was born.  The wealthy Rainbird family couldn't withstand the scandal of a bastard child being born into the family.  Mrs. Rainbird offers to pay Blanch $10 thousand if she can locate the now 40-something man who will inherit her fortune.Blanche's cab driving boyfriend, George Lumley (Bruce Dern), agrees to do the legwork in an attempt to locate the man.  It turns out the man he seeks is a kidnapper and ransom seeking jeweler now known as Arthur Adamson (William Devane) who killed his foster parents in a fire and faked his own death.  Adamson's partner in crime is Fran (Karen Black).  Together they kidnap powerful people who are known to have expensive pieces of jewelry.This Hitchcock film is a bit of a lark and quite whimsical at times.  Blanch, in particular, is a little wacky.  There are too many plot holes, instances of scene continuity, and in one case, a downright ridiculous scene (Blanche and George racing down the mountain with no brakes), to say that this is one of Hitchcock's best films.  Still it was mostly enjoyable and fun to watch.This particular Blu ray disc is certainly not of the same video quality as others in the Hitchcock collection.

In his ""2009 Movie Guide"" Leonard Maltin gives the film just 2 1/2 out of 4 stars and observes that the film is ""mildly entertaining but never credible"".  While this is by no means one of Hitchcock's greatest films ever I always felt  that it was among his most entertaining.  ""Family Plot"" was a departure from Hitchcock's standard fare for a couple of reasons.  First and foremost,  Hitchcock employs liberal doses of humor at various points throughout the film.  In addtion, the film is shot entirely in color which is a radical change from his previous theatrical releases and long running television series which were all filmed in glorious black and white.""Family Plot"" revolves around a missing heir named Eddie Shoebridge now known as Arthur Adamson (William Devane) who turns out to be a rather notorious jewel thief.  Adamson is being sought after by the unlikely duo of would-be psychic Blanche Tyler (Barbara Harris) and her con-man boyfriend, a cab driver named George Lumley (Bruce Dern).  Blanche has been promised the neat sum of $10,000  a lot of money in those days) if she can locate this long lost nephew of one of her elderly clients.  Adamson, who had faked his own death a quarter of a century earlier, gets extremely nervous when strangers begin digging into his unseamly past and  quickly comes to the conclusion that Blanche and George will have to be eliminated.  There are plenty of twists, turns and chuckles along the way to hold your interest.""Family Plot"" features fine performances' by both Bruce Dern and  William Devane who is the absolute personification of evil in this film.

66383,A1FC6VDKRZ2Y2S,0783235674,Robert R. Josef,"[7, 18]","It's hard to believe that this is an Alfred Hitchcock film. If this is any indication, Hitch was beginning to lose it at the end of his life, and bowed out just in time.Even Hitchcock couldn't save a bad script, which is 90% of the problem - his quality control seems to have been totally shot when he read it and thought it was a good idea. It's not so much the structure of the plot -- Hitch could have easily worked within its comedy/drama/mystery setup. Plot holes abound (for example, a jeweler's home with ZERO burglar alarms?), but these could have been tightened up with a few script revisions.However, the dialogue and characterizations are simply atrocious. The dialogue has way too many profanities and little of the wit, style and real humor of most of Hitchcock's classic scripts. The two ""heroes"" are totally unappealing, and the acting doesn't help. Barbara Harris' Blanche is supposed to be ditzy and cute, but her performance makes her shrill and stupid. George, played by Bruce Dern, comes across as a boorish, vulgar jerk. It's hard for them to establish any romantic chemistry when they spend most of their time bickering.On the other hand, William Devane and Karen Black, as the villains, come off as wooden and lifeless . My wife was rooting for all four of them to buy the farm at the end!Hitchcock's direction is uninspired. There is one interesting shot (the graveyard sequence) but, at best, we've seen it before (the out of control car). The film looks like a tacky 70's TV movie or a poor episode of ""McMillan and Wife"", rather than a film from one of history's great directors. And the ending, to say the least, is anticlimactic and dumb.This one is only for Hitchcock completists and those who want to see every one of his films, like my wife and me.

There's some light black comedy and a bit of suspense but nothing really ever grabs you like his best films. The screenplay is by Ernest Lehman who wrote North By Northwest and its perhaps no coincidence that we get a scene from that great film recreated here (and played for laughs) when a car goes out of control going down a mountain road.Look out for Hitchcocks very brief cameo appearance its one of his best.So its no masterpiece, but entertaining enough, and its still Hitchcock.

After a s&eacute;ance, she discovers that Julia is tormented by her past, when she forced her sister and single mother Harriet to deliver her baby for adoption to avoid a family scandal. Julia promises the small fortune of ten thousand-dollar to Blanche if she finds her nephew and heir of her fortune using her phony powers. Blanche asks her boyfriend George Lumley, who is an unemployed actor working as cab driver, to investigate the whereabouts of Julia's nephew. Meanwhile, the greedy jeweler and collector Arthur Adamson kidnaps wealthy people with his girlfriend Fran to increase his collection of diamonds with the ransom. When George concludes that Arthur Adamson might be the heir of Julia Rainbird, the reckless Blanche gets in trouble with the kidnappers.

66392,A2Q457CES5ZUZ,0783235674,William Hare,"[20, 24]","Alfred Hitchcock was a grand tease and the more he teased the more his audiences loved it.  The operative word was suspense and The Master had a genius for milking the action to maximum effect, keeping his faithful audience on the edge of its collective seat.Hitchcock bowed out on an interesting note by concluding his brilliant career with ""Family Plot"" in 1976.  He was mightily assisted in his efforts by one of Hollywood's most skilled screenplay authors, Ernest Lehman.  It was the second time they had teamed up, the earlier effort being one of Hitchcock's most successful films, the 1958 classic ""North by Northwest"" starring Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint and James Mason.In ""Family Plot"" Hitchcock's grand tease was built around a variation of the theme that helped make ""Vertigo"" perhaps the director's finest effort.  That impressive 1957 release was structured around a bogus effort on the part of mastermind criminal Gavin Elster, played by Tom Helmore, to convince retired policeman James Stewart that his putative wife, played by Kim Novak, was under the possessive influence of prominent nineteenth century San Franciscan Carlotta Valdes.  Stewart is led on a bogus chase around San Francisco that includes a phony suicide attempt as Novak jumps into San Francisco Bay.Hitchcock, a film genius who knew how to make the most of a good theme, used this basic concept from ""Vertigo"" in the basic plot of ""Family Plot"" with one essential difference - this time the con artist was not seeking a foolproof way to kill his real wife by having a fall guy reduced to useful fodder in a criminal enterprise.  On this occasion Barbara Harris played the role of a fake psychic who, upon receiving valuable information during a ""reading"" concerning a relative that a wealthy older woman, played by Cathleen Nesbitt, would like to leave with her large inheritance.Bruce Dern, a cab driver who hopes to eventually catch a break in his acting career, has nothing but scorn for Harris's s&eacute;ance performances, but is enticed along on a journey to find the prospective heir when it is revealed that the wealthy older woman Nesbitt will provide them with $10,000 for a successful effort.  The story then spins into a two-part focus in which William Devane, who has changed his name and gained his freedom by killing his adopted parents, has embraced a life as a jeweler moonlighting as a kidnapper, and who receives expensive jewels as payment from his victims.  He also has a girlfriend, Karen Black, who is a reluctantly partner like Dern.  She goes along with the kidnappings but hates to even consider the idea of killing anyone, an element that Devane as a pragmatic and ruthless opportunist is willing to resort to in fulfilling his objective to become a wealthy man.The ingenious story spins into dual efforts where Devane knows that the persistent pair of Harris and Dern is pursuing him, but he is in the dark as to the reason.  He believes that they are aware of his criminal activities.Hitchcock teases viewers into wondering with increasing anticipation what will happen when the two parties ultimately meet.  He places plenty of the familiar Hitchcock obstacles and dodges in the road during the interim.""Family Plot"" is the polished effort of one of Hollywood's most imaginative directors pooling forces with one of the industry's most skilled scriptwriters.  Hitchcock and Lehman prepare a delicious stew for audiences to savor as the last feast of a master of film.",5,The Master Teases Us One Last Time,1121558400,"07 17, 2005",2005,3481,"['Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'was', 'grand', 'tease', 'more', 'teased', 'more', 'audiences', 'loved', 'operative', 'word', 'was', 'suspense', 'Master', 'had', 'genius', 'milking', 'action', 'maximum', 'effect', 'keeping', 'faithful', 'audience', 'edge', 'collective', 'seat.Hitchcock', 'bowed', 'out', 'interesting', 'note', 'concluding', 'brilliant', 'career', 'Family', 'Plot', '1976', 'was', 'mightily', 'assisted', 'efforts', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'most', 'skilled', 'screenplay', 'authors', 'Ernest', 'Lehman', 'was', 'second', 'time', 'had', 'teamed', 'up', 'earlier', 'effort', 'being', 'one', 'Hitchcock', 'most', 'successful', 'films', '1958', 'classic', 'North', 'Northwest', 'starring', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Eva', 'Marie', 'Saint', 'James', 'Mason.In', 'Family', 'Plot', 'Hitchcock', 'grand', 'tease', 'was', 'built', 'variation', 'theme', 'helped', 'make', 'Vertigo', 'perhaps', 'director', 'finest', 'effort', 'impressive', '1957', 'release', 'was', 'structured', 'bogus', 'effort', 'part', 'mastermind', 'criminal', 'Gavin', 'Elster', 'played', 'Tom', 'Helmore', 'convince', 'retired', 'policeman', 'James', 'Stewart', 'putative', 'wife', 'played', 'Kim', 'Novak', 'was', 'possessive', 'influence', 'prominent', 'nineteenth', 'century', 'San', 'Franciscan', 'Carlotta', 'Valdes', 'Stewart', 'led', 'bogus', 'chase', 'San', 'Francisco', 'phony', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'Novak', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Bay.Hitchcock', 'film', 'genius', 'who', 'knew', 'how', 'make', 'most', 'good', 'theme', 'used', 'basic', 'concept', 'Vertigo', 'basic', 'plot', 'Family', 'Plot', 'one', 'essential', 'difference', 'time', 'con', 'artist', 'was', 'not', 'seeking', 'foolproof', 'way', 'kill', 'real', 'wife', 'having', 'fall', 'guy', 'reduced', 'useful', 'fodder', 'criminal', 'enterprise', 'occasion', 'Barbara', 'Harris', 'played', 'role', 'fake', 'psychic', 'who', 'receiving', 'valuable', 'information', 'reading', 'concerning', 'relative', 'wealthy', 'older', 'woman', 'played', 'Cathleen', 'Nesbitt', 'would', 'like', 'leave', 'large', 'inheritance.Bruce', 'Dern', 'cab', 'driver', 'who', 'eventually', 'catch', 'break', 'acting', 'career', 'nothing', 'scorn', 'Harris', 's', 'eacute', 'ance', 'performances', 'enticed', 'journey', 'find', 'prospective', 'heir', 'when', 'revealed', 'wealthy', 'older', 'woman', 'Nesbitt', 'will', 'provide', '10,000', 'successful', 'effort', 'story', 'then', 'two-part', 'focus', 'William', 'Devane', 'who', 'changed', 'name', 'gained', 'freedom', 'killing', 'adopted', 'parents', 'embraced', 'life', 'jeweler', 'moonlighting', 'kidnapper', 'who', 'expensive', 'jewels', 'payment', 'victims', 'also', 'girlfriend', 'Karen', 'Black', 'who', 'reluctantly', 'partner', 'Dern', 'along', 'kidnappings', 'even', 'consider', 'idea', 'killing', 'anyone', 'element', 'Devane', 'pragmatic', 'ruthless', 'opportunist', 'willing', 'resort', 'fulfilling', 'objective', 'become', 'wealthy', 'man.The', 'ingenious', 'story', 'spins', 'dual', 'efforts', 'where', 'Devane', 'persistent', 'pair', 'Harris', 'Dern', 'pursuing', 'dark', 'reason', 'are', 'aware', 'criminal', 'activities.Hitchcock', 'viewers', 'wondering', 'increasing', 'anticipation', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'when', 'two', 'parties', 'ultimately', 'meet', 'plenty', 'familiar', 'Hitchcock', 'obstacles', 'dodges', 'road', 'interim', 'Family', 'Plot', 'polished', 'effort', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'most', 'imaginative', 'directors', 'pooling', 'forces', 'one', 'industry', 'most', 'skilled', 'scriptwriters', 'Hitchcock', 'Lehman', 'prepare', 'delicious', 'stew', 'audiences', 'savor', 'last', 'feast', 'master', 'film']",Family Plot VHS

Remarkably, however, ""Family Plot"" tells a good enough story (and contains good enough acting) to still be a worthwhile experience.For a basic plot summary, ""Family Plot"" tells the story of Blanche Tyler (Barbara Harris), a ""faker"" psychic medium, and her boyfriend George (Bruce Dern).  On one of her phony psychic sessions, Blanche is given the opportunity to earn $10,000 for finding the lost relative of one Julia Rainbird (Cathleen Nesbitt).  As the lovers criss-cross the city looking for the lost man, they end up caught in the scheme of a jewel thief (played by William Devane).The reason this is a solid movie is because the storylines are so interesting.  The hunt for the mysterious ""Eddie Shoebridge"" contains enough mystery to really suck you in and make you WANT to see the resolution.  The concurrent jewel-thief plot is also interesting enough to make you wonder how the two can possibly be related.  Through some of the so-so periods that this movie most definitely hits, the overall goal is fascinating enough that you won't even consider turning it off.Another factor that really helps, too, is the acting.  Bruce Dern is an incredible character actor, and carries every scene he is given.  Harris & Devane are also very capable leads that comprise good scenes with each other.  At those moments when the overall storyline lags just a bit, the acting is good enough to keep you ""in the movie"".Overall, ""Family Plot"" is just an interesting little flick.
