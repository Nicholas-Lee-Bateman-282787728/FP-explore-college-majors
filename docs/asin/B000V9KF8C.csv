They performed flawlessly and the digital video quality of this disk is crystal clear.  The footage was clearly shot by professionals and the editing was outstanding.  The interviews of the 4 band members revealed a lot of facts about Asia that I was not aware of.  I am a die-hard Asia fan.  I've followed them closely since 1982 and some of my friends have been impressed with my knowledge of this band, but the interviews on this disk have enlightened me.  I've seen Asia 5 times in concert, but this concert performance surpassed the 5 that I've seen.  My video quality rating of this D.V.D. is 5 out of 5 and the same goes for the audio quality.  Asia has started working on a new studio album (Phoenix).  Look for it in May of 2008.  This is a great D.V.D.  I gave it 5 stars.  If I could have given it 6, I would have.

They talked with drummer Carl Palmer about reforming Asia for the 25th anniversary of the first album.It was also time to bury the hatchet...Steve Howe returned and the original band was back together.The band agreed to play the entire first album, selected bits from the second album ""Alpha"" and four ""heritage"" tracks from each of their previous musical incarnations.From the majestic opener ""Time Again"", the powerful ""Wildest Dreams"", the Wetton/Howe duet ""One Step Closer"", the moody power ballad ""Without You"", the jazzy,funky ""Cutting It Fine"", the straight rock and roll of ""Here Comes The Feeling"", the power pop of ""Only Time Will Tell"" the heavy metal-esque ""Sole Survivor"" and the band's signature song ""Heat of the Moment"", the first album is performed almost note perfect, as though the band had never split.""Don't Cry"", ""The Smile Has Left Your Eyes"" as well as the ""lost"" Asia song ""Ride Easy"" are given an acoustic treatment.The soloists are also represented as Carl Palmer gives a titanic drum solo during ""The Heat Goes On"", Geoff Downes plays his coda from ""Cutting It Fine"" and Steve Howe plays an acoustic guitar piece, ""Intersection Blues"".The ""heritage"" selections are 4 rock/pop classics;Steve's  contribution was the Yes anthem ""Roundabout"", John rendered the King Crimson masterpiece ""The Court Of The Crimson King"", the band reworked the Buggles' pop classic ""Video Killed The Radio Star"", blowing away the original, and what may be the show's crowning moment, the band performs E.L.P.'s arrangement of ""Fanfare For The Common Man"", featuring amazing trade-offs from Steve and Geoff.The audio and video are first rate, and the songs sound as fresh as they did back in 1982.Marvelous performance. 5 stars.",5,"""The original band...back together & better than ever!""",1272585600,"04 30, 2010",2010,2094,"['guitarist', 'Steve', 'Howe', 'departure', 'band', '1984', 'various', 'incarnations', 'Asia', 'existed', 'most', 'notably', 'Geoff', 'Downes', 'bassist/vocalist', 'John', 'Payne', 'edition', 'ran', '1992-2005', 'original', 'quartet', 'never', 'reformed', 'John', 'Wetton', 'Geoff', 'Downes', 'began', 'writing', 'working', 'together', 'Icon', 're-established', 'musical', 'relationship', 'talked', 'drummer', 'Carl', 'Palmer', 'reforming', 'Asia', '25th', 'anniversary', 'first', 'album.It', 'was', 'also', 'time', 'bury', 'hatchet', 'Steve', 'Howe', 'returned', 'original', 'band', 'was', 'back', 'together.The', 'band', 'agreed', 'play', 'entire', 'first', 'album', 'selected', 'bits', 'second', 'album', 'Alpha', 'four', 'heritage', 'tracks', 'previous', 'musical', 'majestic', 'opener', 'Time', 'Again', 'powerful', 'Wildest', 'Dreams', 'Wetton/Howe', 'duet', 'One', 'Step', 'Closer', 'moody', 'power', 'jazzy', 'funky', 'Cutting', 'Fine', 'straight', 'rock', 'roll', 'Here', 'Feeling', 'power', 'pop', 'Only', 'Time', 'Will', 'Tell', 'heavy', 'metal-esque', 'Sole', 'Survivor', 'band', 'signature', 'song', 'Heat', 'Moment', 'first', 'album', 'performed', 'almost', 'note', 'perfect', 'band', 'had', 'never', 'split', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', 'Smile', 'Has', 'Left', 'Eyes', 'as', 'well', 'lost', 'Asia', 'song', 'Ride', 'Easy', 'are', 'given', 'acoustic', 'treatment.The', 'soloists', 'are', 'also', 'represented', 'Carl', 'Palmer', 'titanic', 'drum', 'solo', 'Heat', 'Goes', 'Geoff', 'Downes', 'coda', 'Cutting', 'Fine', 'Steve', 'Howe', 'acoustic', 'guitar', 'piece', 'Intersection', 'Blues', '.The', 'heritage', 'selections', 'are', '4', 'rock/pop', 'classics', 'Steve', 'contribution', 'was', 'Yes', 'anthem', 'Roundabout', 'John', 'rendered', 'King', 'Crimson', 'Court', 'Crimson', 'King', 'band', 'reworked', 'Buggles', 'pop', 'classic', 'Video', 'Killed', 'Radio', 'Star', 'blowing', 'away', 'original', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'show', 'crowning', 'moment', 'band', 'E.L.P', 'arrangement', 'Fanfare', 'Common', 'Man', 'featuring', 'amazing', 'trade-offs', 'Steve', 'Geoff.The', 'audio', 'video', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'songs', 'sound', 'as', 'fresh', 'did', 'back', '1982.Marvelous', 'performance', '5', 'stars']",N/A

The texture he gives the Asia material makes it what it is.Also, Carl Palmer is just phenomenal.  Drum solo and his stage show is just sensational.  I had a chance of seeing them in Glenside PA at the Keswick theater last year and it was just great.  They all greeted the fans after the show.I think they are not in this for the long haul but I've heard reports from John Wetton when he was interviewed recently following his triple heart Bypass that they are currently writing songs for the new album.  Yes Is scheduled for touring in 2008, so I believe the other members of Asia will definitly come together from time and time to play.

Lay ""panamax""","[0, 0]","I have been waiting for these release since I started my DVD collection some years ago.When the Ultimate Collection came out I bought it without hesitation, however the fact that Steve Howe wasn't involved (key part in their unique sound) and that audio quality was subpar for the Nottingham and Moscow concerts, it made for just a pit stop while waiting for the reunion DVD.But now to the point:  although the song selection, filming and playing is great, it is regrettable that the surround mix is not properly balanced and way too focused on the keyboards, that basically shadow Howe's guitars.  I tried all three mixes (stereo, Dolby and DTS) with the same results.I decided to play the DVD audio through an equalizer and finally everything came alive.  Fully balanced sound and nice detailed sound from Mr. Wetton, Howe, Palmer and Downes.  And I enjoyed it greatly.Some have complained about song selection, but although I would have wanted Astra to be featured (I don't care much for the Payne era), Asia wanted to celebrate the chemistry they had together on those first two albums, and somehow acknowledge the road that led them together (Yes, ELP, King Crimson, Buggles).  And I respect that and certainly their choice didn't dissapoint.This is such a great DVD that if surround mix is corrected I would definitely buy it again.

1099799,A3PFHVS7V4UZTG,B000V9KF8C,Glenn O. Kirms,"[3, 9]","Okay, I'll be the one to come out and say the negative here since no one else will and everyone else is just raving about the original four getting back together.  I've listened to Asia since their beginning album.  I saw the Asia in Asia concert on MTV with Greg Lake stepping in for John Wetton.  I was excited when they got back together for their 'Then and Now' album.  I have John Wetton's solo works.  I listen to ELP, Yes, and I've dabbled with King Crimson. You get my drift, I'm an Asia fan.  While I'll give this a great thumbs up for quality because it is the 21st century I'll give it is a thumbs down for their song selection.  I was interviewed by my local paper about progressive music around the time that Asia was in my neck of the woods on their tour.  Asked if I would be going I said no because of work scheduling and I just didn't want to hear a nostalgic tour which is pretty evident by everyone's reviews that's just  what these die hard fans want to listen to.  It's not like I haven't heard ""Only Time Will Tell' and 'Heat of the Moment' ten thousand times already.  And I know that the song selection was done by the group as far as the other non-Asia pieces, but everything that was played was just pretty safe.  Call it what you want, but I would have expected more from these outstanding musicians.  And nothing played from the 'Astra' album??  And for all the really true die-hard fans out there that supported Asia after they officially broke up, but Downes kept them going bringing in John Payne as lead singer;  what about any of those songs from the five albums that they did and especially their last ""Silent Nation' which received critical acclaim.  Nothing at all played.  Pretty much a slap in the face to the fans of Asia, both to the Wetton era and Payne era.  Of course, this is just my opinion, but so much more could have been done during this tour than what they actually did.  Not saying that what they did was terrible or anything, but it just didn't cover enough ground as far as Asia is concerned.  I could do without the ELP, Yes, The Buggles songs for more of Asia since they do have a vast catalog (and I've heard those songs tons too), but you wouldn't know that now looking at their revamped website.  Before the original four got back together all Asia albums were listed on the site.  But now, the post Wetton era albums are gone, blown away into the abyss like they never existed.  What a shame.  Although never a big fan of John Payne's singing style (it would have been cool to hear Wetton sing some of his songs since Payne sang plenty of Wetton's songs), I think Asia really matured musically through the years with Downes and Payne leading the way for Asia.  And now, it appears that Asia wants those years forgotten, not playing any of that material, but Payne and his new band GPS is still out there playing a couple of Asia tunes on his current tour.  Go figure.  So, if you loved Asia back in the day and didn't like it that Greg Lake stepped in for the VHS taping of Asia in Asia, then here's your chance to see them again in a much better way.",3,This is It?,1193443200,"10 27, 2007",2007,3110,"['Okay', ""'ll"", 'be', 'one', 'come', 'out', 'say', 'negative', 'here', 'one', 'else', 'will', 'everyone', 'else', 'just', 'raving', 'original', 'four', 'getting', 'back', 'together', ""'ve"", 'listened', 'Asia', 'beginning', 'album', 'saw', 'Asia', 'Asia', 'concert', 'MTV', 'Greg', 'Lake', 'stepping', 'John', 'Wetton', 'was', 'excited', 'when', 'got', 'back', 'together', ""'Then"", 'Now', 'album', 'have', 'John', 'Wetton', 'solo', 'listen', 'ELP', 'Yes', ""'ve"", 'dabbled', 'King', 'Crimson', 'get', 'drift', ""'m"", 'Asia', 'fan', ""'ll"", 'give', 'great', 'thumbs', 'up', 'quality', '21st', 'century', ""'ll"", 'give', 'thumbs', 'down', 'song', 'selection', 'was', 'interviewed', 'local', 'paper', 'progressive', 'music', 'time', 'Asia', 'was', 'neck', 'woods', 'tour', 'Asked', 'would', 'be', 'going', 'said', 'work', 'scheduling', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'hear', 'nostalgic', 'tour', 'pretty', 'evident', 'everyone', 'reviews', 'just', 'what', 'die', 'hard', 'fans', 'want', 'listen', 'not', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'Only', 'Time', 'Will', 'Tell', ""'Heat"", 'Moment', 'ten', 'thousand', 'times', 'already', 'know', 'song', 'selection', 'was', 'done', 'group', 'as', 'far', 'other', 'non-Asia', 'pieces', 'everything', 'was', 'played', 'was', 'just', 'pretty', 'safe', 'Call', 'want', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'more', 'outstanding', 'musicians', 'nothing', 'played', ""'Astra"", 'album', 'really', 'true', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'out', 'there', 'supported', 'Asia', 'officially', 'broke', 'up', 'Downes', 'kept', 'going', 'bringing', 'John', 'Payne', 'lead', 'singer', 'what', 'songs', 'five', 'albums', 'did', 'especially', 'last', 'Silent', 'Nation', 'received', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'Nothing', 'played', 'Pretty', 'much', 'slap', 'face', 'fans', 'Asia', 'Wetton', 'era', 'Payne', 'era', 'course', 'just', 'opinion', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'tour', 'what', 'actually', 'did', 'Not', 'saying', 'what', 'did', 'was', 'terrible', 'anything', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'cover', 'enough', 'ground', 'as', 'far', 'Asia', 'concerned', 'could', 'do', 'ELP', 'Yes', 'Buggles', 'songs', 'more', 'Asia', 'do', 'have', 'vast', 'catalog', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'songs', 'tons', 'too', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'now', 'looking', 'revamped', 'website', 'original', 'four', 'got', 'back', 'together', 'Asia', 'albums', 'were', 'listed', 'site', 'now', 'post', 'Wetton', 'era', 'albums', 'are', 'gone', 'blown', 'away', 'abyss', 'never', 'existed', 'What', 'shame', 'never', 'big', 'fan', 'John', 'Payne', 'singing', 'style', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'cool', 'hear', 'Wetton', 'sing', 'songs', 'Payne', 'sang', 'plenty', 'Wetton', 'songs', 'think', 'Asia', 'really', 'matured', 'musically', 'years', 'Downes', 'Payne', 'leading', 'way', 'Asia', 'now', 'Asia', 'years', 'forgotten', 'not', 'playing', 'material', 'Payne', 'new', 'band', 'GPS', 'still', 'there', 'playing', 'couple', 'Asia', 'tunes', 'current', 'tour', 'Go', 'figure', 'So', 'loved', 'Asia', 'back', 'day', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Greg', 'Lake', 'stepped', 'VHS', 'taping', 'Asia', 'Asia', 'then', 'here', 'chance', 'see', 'again', 'much', 'better', 'way']",N/A

1099801,A2X7NBUETXC19E,B000V9KF8C,Justin G.,"[6, 12]","I know I'm in the minority here, but I was actually less than thrilled when I heard that the original Asia lineup was reforming. I had become a big fan of the later Asia albums with John Payne on vocals, and while I understand the reason$ behind the reunion, it was still disappointing to see the Payne era come to an end with little or no mention by Geoff Downes or anyone else of the great music that Asia lineup created over the past 15 years. Still, I must confess I was curious to see what a reunited original Asia lineup would be like after so many years. I didn't catch them on their reunion tour, so the Fantasia: Live in Tokyo DVD was the next best thing.The Main Program - The DVD is a fairly straightforward concert performance video that was shot before a large audience in Japan. The band served up about a dozen classic Asia tracks as well as versions of songs from each member's pre-Asia career. The execution of the old Asia tracks was flawless, if a bit cold. These guys are all masters of their respective crafts, so they can probably perform these songs in their sleep. Unfortunately there were times that I wondered if the band was doing exactly that! I know we're talking about older musicians here, but a little more energy would have been nice. They didn't look like they were having any fun, and barely did anything to work the crowd. A live performance, especially one recorded for a DVD release should be a special occasion, and this one falls a bit short.I wasn't crazy about the non-Asia material either. It's a neat enough idea I suppose, but given the choice between hearing an original Asia song or a cover of ""Video Killed the Radio Star"", I'll take the former any day. And as much as I love ""Roundabout"" or ""Fanfare for the Common Man"", that's not why I bought an Asia DVD.The Special Features - Aside from some interview footage, there really wasn't much in terms of bonus content on this DVD. If the main program was more impressive, the lack of bonus content probably wouldn't have been noticed.The Verdict - If you're a serious Asia fan, you're going to want this DVD. There's really no getting around it. Unfortunately it's just not as exciting a reunion performance as I was expecting. I had much more fun seeing Asia with John Payne at a club in Virginia just prior to the release ofSilent Nationthan I would have at this concert.",3,"Live, but not very lively.",1199750400,"01 8, 2008",2008,2370,"['know', ""'m"", 'minority', 'here', 'was', 'actually', 'less', 'thrilled', 'when', 'heard', 'original', 'Asia', 'lineup', 'was', 'reforming', 'had', 'become', 'big', 'fan', 'later', 'Asia', 'albums', 'John', 'Payne', 'vocals', 'understand', 'reason', 'reunion', 'was', 'still', 'disappointing', 'see', 'Payne', 'era', 'come', 'end', 'little', 'mention', 'Geoff', 'Downes', 'anyone', 'else', 'great', 'music', 'Asia', 'lineup', 'created', 'past', '15', 'years', 'Still', 'must', 'confess', 'was', 'curious', 'see', 'what', 'reunited', 'original', 'Asia', 'lineup', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'did', ""n't"", 'catch', 'reunion', 'tour', 'Fantasia', 'Live', 'Tokyo', 'DVD', 'was', 'next', 'best', 'thing.The', 'Main', 'Program', 'DVD', 'fairly', 'straightforward', 'concert', 'performance', 'video', 'was', 'shot', 'large', 'audience', 'Japan', 'band', 'served', 'up', 'dozen', 'classic', 'Asia', 'tracks', 'as', 'well', 'versions', 'songs', 'member', 'pre-Asia', 'career', 'execution', 'old', 'Asia', 'tracks', 'was', 'flawless', 'bit', 'cold', 'guys', 'are', 'masters', 'respective', 'crafts', 'can', 'probably', 'perform', 'songs', 'sleep', 'Unfortunately', 'were', 'times', 'wondered', 'band', 'was', 'doing', 'exactly', 'know', ""'re"", 'talking', 'older', 'musicians', 'here', 'little', 'more', 'energy', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'were', 'having', 'fun', 'barely', 'did', 'anything', 'work', 'crowd', 'live', 'performance', 'especially', 'one', 'recorded', 'DVD', 'release', 'should', 'be', 'special', 'occasion', 'one', 'bit', 'short.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'crazy', 'non-Asia', 'material', 'neat', 'enough', 'idea', 'suppose', 'given', 'choice', 'hearing', 'original', 'Asia', 'song', 'cover', 'Video', 'Killed', 'Radio', 'Star', ""'ll"", 'take', 'former', 'day', 'as', 'much', 'love', 'Roundabout', 'Fanfare', 'Common', 'Man', 'not', 'why', 'bought', 'Asia', 'DVD.The', 'Special', 'Features', 'Aside', 'interview', 'footage', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'terms', 'bonus', 'content', 'DVD', 'main', 'program', 'was', 'more', 'impressive', 'lack', 'bonus', 'content', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'noticed.The', 'Verdict', ""'re"", 'serious', 'Asia', 'fan', ""'re"", 'going', 'want', 'DVD', 'really', 'getting', 'just', 'not', 'exciting', 'reunion', 'performance', 'was', 'expecting', 'had', 'much', 'more', 'fun', 'seeing', 'Asia', 'John', 'Payne', 'club', 'Virginia', 'just', 'prior', 'release', 'ofSilent', 'Nationthan', 'would', 'have', 'concert']",N/A

For instance ""Heat of the moment"" or ""A Ride easy"" could make me change idea about the present reunion...but it's a minor question: ok the execution of the above hits (e.g. inside ""Heat of the moment"", where S. Howe is not completely into the riff and the aggressive guitar sound of his original take dated 1981) and also their difficult intro concerning the progressive tune ""Time again"" (in this video performance quite stunning anyway, even though performed slowly), let me think that their pop songs have not been played with a great impact after all, but it's not true. I always like John Wetton on vocals, being almost aligned to his glory days and He's also very conscious of his role during his bass-guitar execution in general; then all the musicians play very well!!So all these features don't change my first idea about the reunion, as well as my consequent personal rating.I think of a band with such a great experience, even though the set of keyboards used by Downes is not always suitable for their oldies; therefore Steve Howe sometimes seems to be - just a little bit - a fish out of water (except on his fine Blues Intersection: well actually here I forget how this latter instrumental intermezzo was acclaimed in a controversial or cold manner during their recent concert in Italy - 2007 july, 23 at the gig of Asti Festival - but never mind, cause the enthusiastic acclamation regarding all the other tunes was great!!). Instead coming back to the guitar tracks and analyzing the particular guitar style, the harmonization within ""Fanfare for the common man"" and ""Roundabout"" show the top form of the old guitarist. Moreover this video performance, more than within the audio cd, demostrates how Steve is still great and quite funny also when He jumps during his guitar solos.Instead Palmer as usual is a precise drummer and even excellent during his drum solos... you can see his best approach within the classic instrumental track from ""Works"" by ELP, an ever green!!.At the end forget a few breaks through only, where the whole band is not completely confident: the rythmical aspects I mean, above all where occasionally the timing of Downes keyboards or Steve at his mandolin in the acoustic set are not suitable,especially talking about their syncronization; but it's always a minor question, because the rest of the performance is memorable...Long Live Asia!!",4,Long Live Asia-also regarding of a few defects within this video performance,1195257600,"11 17, 2007",2007,2687,"['Well', 'are', 'few', 'oldies', 'classic', 'prog/romantic', 'scene', 'Roundabout', 'Court', 'K.C', 'Fanfare', 'common', 'man', 'regarded', 'bit', 'strident', 'comparison', 'more', 'commercial/pop', 'hit', 'singles', 'reason', 'only', 'could', 'erase', 'half', 'star', 'evalution', 'instance', 'Heat', 'moment', 'Ride', 'easy', 'could', 'make', 'change', 'idea', 'present', 'reunion', 'minor', 'question', 'execution', 'above', 'hits', 'e.g', 'Heat', 'moment', 'where', 'S.', 'Howe', 'not', 'completely', 'riff', 'aggressive', 'guitar', 'sound', 'original', 'take', 'dated', '1981', 'also', 'difficult', 'intro', 'concerning', 'progressive', 'tune', 'Time', 'again', 'video', 'performance', 'quite', 'stunning', 'anyway', 'even', 'performed', 'slowly', 'let', 'think', 'pop', 'songs', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'played', 'great', 'impact', 'not', 'true', 'always', 'John', 'Wetton', 'vocals', 'being', 'almost', 'aligned', 'glory', 'days', 'also', 'very', 'conscious', 'role', 'bass-guitar', 'execution', 'general', 'then', 'musicians', 'play', 'very', 'well', 'features', 'do', ""n't"", 'change', 'first', 'idea', 'reunion', 'as', 'well', 'consequent', 'personal', 'rating.I', 'think', 'band', 'such', 'great', 'experience', 'even', 'set', 'keyboards', 'used', 'Downes', 'not', 'always', 'suitable', 'oldies', 'therefore', 'Steve', 'Howe', 'sometimes', 'be', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'fish', 'water', 'fine', 'Blues', 'Intersection', 'well', 'actually', 'here', 'forget', 'how', 'latter', 'instrumental', 'intermezzo', 'was', 'acclaimed', 'controversial', 'cold', 'manner', 'recent', 'concert', 'Italy', '2007', 'july', '23', 'gig', 'Asti', 'Festival', 'never', 'mind', 'cause', 'enthusiastic', 'acclamation', 'regarding', 'other', 'tunes', 'was', 'great', 'Instead', 'coming', 'back', 'guitar', 'tracks', 'analyzing', 'particular', 'guitar', 'style', 'harmonization', 'Fanfare', 'common', 'man', 'Roundabout', 'show', 'top', 'form', 'old', 'guitarist', 'Moreover', 'video', 'performance', 'more', 'audio', 'cd', 'how', 'Steve', 'still', 'great', 'quite', 'funny', 'also', 'when', 'guitar', 'solos.Instead', 'Palmer', 'usual', 'precise', 'drummer', 'even', 'excellent', 'drum', 'solos', 'can', 'see', 'best', 'approach', 'classic', 'instrumental', 'track', 'Works', 'ELP', 'ever', 'green', 'end', 'forget', 'few', 'breaks', 'only', 'where', 'whole', 'band', 'not', 'completely', 'confident', 'rythmical', 'aspects', 'mean', 'where', 'occasionally', 'timing', 'Downes', 'keyboards', 'Steve', 'mandolin', 'acoustic', 'set', 'are', 'not', 'suitable', 'especially', 'talking', 'syncronization', 'always', 'minor', 'question', 'rest', 'performance', 'memorable', 'Long', 'Live', 'Asia']",N/A

An outstanding music DVD (filmed in Tokyo) which features the 4 original members (John Wetton, Steve Howe, Geoffrey Downes, and Carl Palmer), accompanied by excellent sound quality and camera work. The camera focusses on the band members playing and does not dart back and forth from the audience to the band members.  What a relief!  This DVD marks the 25th anniversary of the 1st Asia album, which came out in 1982.The songset consists of 18 pieces:1. Time Again2. Wildest Dreams3. One Step Closer4. Roundabout5. Without You6. Cutting It Fine7. Intersection Blues - Steve's Solo8. Fanfare for the Common Man9. The Smile has Left Your Eyes10. Don't Cry11. In the Court of the Crimson King12. Here comes the Feeling13. Video Killed the Radio Star14. The Heat Goes On -- Drum Solo15. Only Time Will Tell16. Ride Easy17. Heat of the MomentBonus Feature:  Interviews with AsiaThis DVD features most of their most well-known songs (Heat of the Moment, Only Time will Tell, Sole Survivor, Don't Cry, The Smile has Left Your Eyes), as well as some samplings from King Crimson (In the Court of the Crimson King) and Yes (Roundabout).  I was especially surprised how well John Wetton sang ""Roundabout"" -- his full-bodied singing was outstanding and was a great re-endition of the Yes classic.In celebration of the 25th anniversary, Asia sang the rare song ""Ride Easy"", which did not appear on any album but was the flip-side for the cassette of ""Heat of the Moment"" single (in 1982).  This song was the favorite song of John Wetton in all of the Asia repertoire.Steve Howe seemed to be really enjoying his playing, especially the solo piece ""Intersection Blues"".  In other concerts, he was usually dour, but on this one he seemed like he was having fun.  The only drawback in this DVD is that the sound does not quite pick up Howe's electric guitar, especially on songs like ""Only Time Will Tell"".Most of the songs stick very closely to the studio versions, except for ""Don't Cry"" which is done acoustically.  One of the best features in this DVD is the extensive interview of all the 4 original band members.  Each member talked about his musical background, the bands they played in, how they got together to form Asia, and what Asia meant to them after 25 years.  It was such a close and personal interview.  It's so great to have these 4 outstanding musicians team up again after so many years.If you're an Asia fan, run and buy this DVD!  You'll be impressed!  It is absolutely essential for your music DVD collection.

Well, the interviews dispell this myth along with a few others. He was actually the last to join this lineup.When I first saw this 25th anniversary lineup announced, my cynical and jaded self figured that it was nothing but a dirty rotten money making scheme from record company execs.

Having seen the interviews and the interaction on stage, there is a lot of mutual respect for each other and they all realize that the chemistry was just right in 1982 when their debut album was released. They can now look back on what went right and plan for their next new release. Yes, this does not appear to be a one-shot reunion for nostalgia and monetary purposes.

In March 2007 ""Asia"" band members Geoff Downes, Steve Howe, Carl Palmer and John Wetton reunited for this memorable 25th anniversary concert in Tokyo Japan. Hailed as one of the first super groups of the 1980's ""Asia"" definitely lived up to their billing as they ripped through 17 songs with great timing & precision. The bands' playing was just as incredible in 2007 as it was when they formed in 1982.For me this concert DVD was everything I had hoped for and so much more. I'll admit that the guys are 25 years older and definitely showing their age but they haven't lost anything when it comes to their musicianship on stage. Steve Howe seemed to really enjoy the whole reunion experience and his guitar playing was outstanding to say the least. Carl Palmer's drumming in my opinion was truly awesome and he made it seem effortless as he went about his business as usual. Geoff Downes sounded much louder compared to the others, but he was still the showman on stage and his playing didn't disappoint. What can you say about John Wetton, his voice has truly stood the test of time and it's hard to believe 25 years has gone by. He was in fine form for this concert and he sounded as good as ever. He seemed to be in sync with the music and had no problem hitting all the notes.""Asia"" live in Tokyo Japan marks the 25th anniversary of the band and fans will not want to miss out on this memorable performance. Eagle Rock Entertainment has done an incredible job with this DVD release. The video image is absolutely spectacular. The picture is crisp and clear and the colors are vibrant and sharp. I can't find any faults with the sound options; the 5.1 Dolby Digital and DTS sound options are simply outstanding. The camera angles and editing are stellar and I wish every DVD concert was filmed like this one. In my opinion this is the best ""Asia"" concert DVD on the market and fans would be happy to own it.DVD Songs:Time Again / Wildest Dreams / One Step Closer /Roundabout / Without You / Cutting it Fine / Intersection Blues - Steve's Solo / Fanfare For the Common Man / The Smile Has Left Your Eyes / Don't Cry / Court of the Crimson King / Here Comes the Feeling / Video Killed the Radio Star / The Heat Goes On - Drum Solo / Only Time Will Tell / Sole Survivor / Ride Easy / Heat of the Moment /DVD Bonus Features:Interviews with Asia Band Members",5,PROGRESSIVE ROCK AT ITS BEST !,1233532800,"02 2, 2009",2009,2471,"['bought', 'concert', 'DVD', 'Heat', 'Moment', 'quickly', 'become', 'one', 'favorite', 'concert', 'DVD', 'March', '2007', 'Asia', 'band', 'members', 'Geoff', 'Downes', 'Steve', 'Howe', 'Carl', 'Palmer', 'John', 'Wetton', 'reunited', 'memorable', '25th', 'anniversary', 'concert', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', 'Hailed', 'one', 'first', 'super', 'groups', '1980', 'Asia', 'definitely', 'lived', 'up', 'billing', 'ripped', '17', 'songs', 'great', 'timing', 'precision', 'bands', 'playing', 'was', 'just', 'incredible', '2007', 'was', 'when', 'formed', '1982.For', 'concert', 'DVD', 'was', 'everything', 'had', 'hoped', 'so', 'much', 'more', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'guys', 'are', '25', 'years', 'older', 'definitely', 'showing', 'age', 'have', ""n't"", 'lost', 'anything', 'when', 'musicianship', 'stage', 'Steve', 'Howe', 'seemed', 'really', 'enjoy', 'whole', 'reunion', 'experience', 'guitar', 'playing', 'was', 'outstanding', 'say', 'least', 'Carl', 'Palmer', 'drumming', 'opinion', 'was', 'truly', 'awesome', 'made', 'seem', 'effortless', 'went', 'business', 'usual', 'Geoff', 'Downes', 'sounded', 'much', 'louder', 'compared', 'others', 'was', 'still', 'showman', 'stage', 'playing', 'did', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'What', 'can', 'say', 'John', 'Wetton', 'voice', 'truly', 'stood', 'test', 'time', 'hard', 'believe', '25', 'years', 'gone', 'was', 'fine', 'form', 'concert', 'sounded', 'as', 'good', 'ever', 'seemed', 'be', 'sync', 'music', 'had', 'problem', 'hitting', 'notes', 'Asia', 'live', 'Tokyo', 'Japan', '25th', 'anniversary', 'band', 'fans', 'will', 'not', 'want', 'miss', 'out', 'memorable', 'performance', 'Eagle', 'Rock', 'Entertainment', 'done', 'incredible', 'job', 'DVD', 'release', 'video', 'image', 'absolutely', 'spectacular', 'picture', 'crisp', 'clear', 'colors', 'are', 'vibrant', 'sharp', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'faults', 'sound', 'options', '5.1', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'DTS', 'sound', 'options', 'are', 'simply', 'outstanding', 'camera', 'angles', 'editing', 'are', 'stellar', 'wish', 'DVD', 'concert', 'was', 'filmed', 'one', 'opinion', 'best', 'Asia', 'concert', 'DVD', 'market', 'fans', 'would', 'be', 'happy', 'own', 'it.DVD', 'Songs', 'Time', 'Again', '/', 'Wildest', 'Dreams', '/', 'One', 'Step', 'Closer', '/Roundabout', '/', '/', 'Cutting', 'Fine', '/', 'Intersection', 'Blues', 'Steve', 'Solo', '/', 'Fanfare', 'Common', 'Man', 'Smile', 'Has', 'Left', 'Eyes', '/', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', '/', 'Court', 'Crimson', 'King', '/', 'Here', 'Feeling', '/', 'Video', 'Killed', 'Radio', 'Star', '/', 'Heat', 'Goes', 'Drum', 'Solo', '/', 'Only', 'Time', 'Will', 'Tell', '/', 'Sole', 'Survivor', '/', 'Ride', 'Easy', '/', 'Heat', 'Moment', '/DVD', 'Bonus', 'Features', 'Interviews', 'Asia', 'Band', 'Members']",N/A

Pence,"[3, 9]","While the original lineup of Asia was an undeniably good band who proiduced a bona fide classic in their 1982 debut, the 1990's-early 2000's lineup of Asia was an even more superior band who made some fantastic music. Sadly, that era of the band is being swept under the carpet as if it never happened, which is a shame, because Asia with John Payne was one of the greatest shows of the early 2000's - I was fortunate enough to see this band three times live. Apparently John Wetton's jealousy of Payne's talent was so intense that there was not room enough for both of them in the band. I'm a fan of both Asia lineups, and I have no doubt that this is a great concert DVD, but it would be wrong to support Asia under current circumstances. Try to find the out of print DVD Asia in America to see this band truly at the top of their powers. Or spend your money on the GPS album instead.This is the original lineup - but the late lamented John Payne lineup is the definitive one.",3,The original lineup - not the definitive one,1198627200,"12 26, 2007",2007,978,"['original', 'lineup', 'Asia', 'was', 'undeniably', 'good', 'band', 'who', 'proiduced', 'bona', 'fide', 'classic', '1982', 'debut', ""1990's-early"", '2000', 'lineup', 'Asia', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'superior', 'band', 'who', 'made', 'fantastic', 'music', 'Sadly', 'era', 'band', 'being', 'swept', 'carpet', 'never', 'happened', 'shame', 'Asia', 'John', 'Payne', 'was', 'one', 'greatest', 'shows', 'early', '2000', 'was', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'see', 'band', 'three', 'times', 'live', 'Apparently', 'John', 'Wetton', 'jealousy', 'Payne', 'talent', 'was', 'so', 'intense', 'was', 'not', 'room', 'enough', 'band', ""'m"", 'fan', 'Asia', 'lineups', 'have', 'doubt', 'great', 'concert', 'DVD', 'would', 'be', 'wrong', 'support', 'Asia', 'current', 'circumstances', 'Try', 'find', 'out', 'print', 'DVD', 'Asia', 'America', 'see', 'band', 'truly', 'top', 'powers', 'spend', 'money', 'GPS', 'album', 'instead.This', 'original', 'lineup', 'late', 'lamented', 'John', 'Payne', 'lineup', 'definitive', 'one']",N/A
