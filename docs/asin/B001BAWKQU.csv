1171162,A24PTVSZSM8968,B001BAWKQU,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","this movie follows an oft-done formula of a girl who is afraid to disappoint her family and cooks up a fake boyfriend. In this case, the girl seems a bit out of control. She gets dumped right before heading out for Christmas. Instead of hiring a fake boyfriend, like some movies of this type, she kidnaps one from the restaurant where she works. There are a number of implausible plot twists that keep him from being able to extricate himself. It turns out he was supposed to have met his fiancee when he was kidnapped so when he wasn't at the restaurant it caused friction which allowed him to end up with his kidnapper. While there are a few cute scenes in the movie and while it gets better towards the end, this one is just a bit too unbelievable to be great. I found the movie to be watchable but not terribly memorable. I suppose that for a TV movie, the quality of production and acting isn't bad, but this isn't the best Christmas romance movie you will find.",3,A bit shaky,1387670400,"12 22, 2013",2013,967,"['movie', 'oft-done', 'formula', 'girl', 'who', 'afraid', 'disappoint', 'family', 'up', 'fake', 'boyfriend', 'case', 'girl', 'bit', 'control', 'dumped', 'right', 'heading', 'out', 'Christmas', 'Instead', 'hiring', 'fake', 'boyfriend', 'movies', 'type', 'kidnaps', 'one', 'restaurant', 'where', 'are', 'number', 'implausible', 'plot', 'twists', 'keep', 'being', 'able', 'extricate', 'out', 'was', 'supposed', 'have', 'met', 'fiancee', 'when', 'was', 'kidnapped', 'so', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'restaurant', 'caused', 'friction', 'allowed', 'end', 'up', 'kidnapper', 'are', 'few', 'cute', 'scenes', 'movie', 'better', 'end', 'one', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'unbelievable', 'be', 'great', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'watchable', 'not', 'terribly', 'memorable', 'suppose', 'TV', 'movie', 'quality', 'production', 'acting', ""n't"", 'bad', ""n't"", 'best', 'Christmas', 'romance', 'movie', 'will', 'find']",Holiday in Handcuffs
1171163,A3QNER0M9CJ22N,B001BAWKQU,"Anna Robb ""SaraShaw""","[8, 10]","This is a funny holiday flick if you aren't too stuck on a ""Family"" movie. As other reviews noted, Melissa Joan Hart plays a girl desperate to bring her great boyfriend home to show her family how successful she is. Right at the moment her career is not great so the boyfriend is all she feels she has. Unfortunately, successful boy dumps her right before traveling to the family home and she, well, loses it, and kidnaps random stranger - Mario Lopez.Part of the fun is that Melissa Joan Hart's character manages to keep Lopez kidnapped for about a day or so because the entire idea of a woman doing this is so insane, all she need do is tell people it is a game the two love birds like to play. Also after about a day it is clear that Lopez character is no longer concerned about being kidnapped and decides to go with it. Thus, making it a little more believable that this sort of thing could happen. After all, she kidnapped him to a loving family gathered in a plush Christmas cabin.  But if you are going to watch a movie called Christmas in handcuffs, maybe reality isn't what you are looking for.I thought the side plots were somewhat pointless but meant to show that the rest of the family were having just as many problems as the main character. What sells this is Hart and Lopez. Good chemistry, and Hart's character does regret what she did after the initial insanity has worn off but has little choice but to keep the charade up.",5,Twisted but fun,1229817600,"12 21, 2008",2008,1442,"['funny', 'holiday', 'flick', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'stuck', 'Family', 'movie', 'other', 'reviews', 'noted', 'Melissa', 'Joan', 'Hart', 'girl', 'desperate', 'bring', 'great', 'boyfriend', 'home', 'show', 'family', 'how', 'successful', 'Right', 'moment', 'career', 'not', 'great', 'boyfriend', 'Unfortunately', 'successful', 'boy', 'right', 'traveling', 'family', 'home', 'well', 'kidnaps', 'random', 'stranger', 'Mario', 'Lopez.Part', 'fun', 'Melissa', 'Joan', 'Hart', 'character', 'keep', 'Lopez', 'kidnapped', 'day', 'so', 'entire', 'idea', 'woman', 'doing', 'so', 'insane', 'need', 'do', 'tell', 'people', 'game', 'two', 'love', 'birds', 'play', 'Also', 'day', 'clear', 'Lopez', 'character', 'longer', 'concerned', 'being', 'kidnapped', 'decides', 'go', 'Thus', 'making', 'little', 'more', 'believable', 'sort', 'thing', 'could', 'happen', 'kidnapped', 'loving', 'family', 'gathered', 'plush', 'Christmas', 'cabin', 'are', 'going', 'watch', 'movie', 'called', 'Christmas', 'handcuffs', 'maybe', 'reality', ""n't"", 'what', 'are', 'looking', 'for.I', 'thought', 'side', 'plots', 'were', 'somewhat', 'pointless', 'meant', 'show', 'rest', 'family', 'were', 'having', 'just', 'many', 'problems', 'main', 'character', 'What', 'Hart', 'Lopez', 'Good', 'chemistry', 'Hart', 'character', 'regret', 'what', 'did', 'initial', 'insanity', 'worn', 'off', 'little', 'choice', 'keep', 'charade', 'up']",Holiday in Handcuffs

1171168,AZCFS1OAU86YK,B001BAWKQU,C. Cloutier,"[2, 4]","First and foremost, yes, the plot is silly and unbelievable.  What did you expect?  One of the negative reviewers complained that the characters made choices ""for which there is no believable consequence"".  So?  Movies are not supposed to be an accurate portrayal of reality; they're meant to be an escape from reality, a fantasy.  If you want reality, then go watch a documentary.Second, this is not a family-friendly movie.  I have to agree with the other reviewers that there is definitely too much sexual banter to be appropriate for viewing by children.  Yes, it's only talk, but it's still not stuff I would be saying around children.Third, the marketing department should have come up with better cover art.  The fact that the scene depicted is not in the movie is forgivable.  The fact that the image of Melissa Joan Hart looks nothing like she does in reality is not forgivable.Lastly, if you're so bigoted, small-minded, and insecure that the mere mention of someone being a homosexual (mentioned in only two scenes) ruins the movie experience for you, then yes, look elsewhere.  Those people who actually watch and understand the movie will know why it was included.Having said all that, this really is a good movie.  Yes, it's unbelievable.  Yes, it does start off slow.  And yes, the family arguing is reminiscent of reality, but it's necessary for the storyline.  The characters themselves are believable and the acting is superb.  Melissa Joan Hart gives a top-notch performance ensuring that you can't help but fall in love with her character.With regard to Christmas, this movie misses the mark because it really has very little to do with Christmas.

It has Melissa Joan Hart from Sabrina the Teenage Witch and Mario Lopez from Saved by the Bell not that that makes a difference. I just like those two actors. And I like this movie. All it showed was a girl who was desperate to tell her family one positive thing about her life for Christmas to the point that when her fiancee dumps her her desperation kicks into overdrive and she resorts to kidnaping. And by the  way if look at the way her family acts you can see where she got her desperation and her craziness. I just watched this movie so I should know. Anyway as I said it was out of desperation that she resorted to kidnaping. Fortunally for all concerned they fall in love. It may not be the best of Christmas movies but its far from the worst.

I was glad I did. This is a very entertaining movie. I guess what really ""made"" the movie was the talented cast! It takes a while to get going, but stay with it. The climax and the end are very funny and definitely worth the wait. This movie is a light, and I'm sure some would say, ""fluffy"" movie; but it's a lot of fun to watch. Mario Lopez is a very unappreciated actor and I feel that Melissa Joan Hart can carry off cute and funny without trying - or seeming unbelievable. Not everyone can carry it off.

What grown man in his right mind would allow himself to stay captive all holiday because some immature woman won't tell her parents her boyfriend dumped her? It's all rather pathetic.Not to mention for an ABC Family movie I am really not sure I can put my finger on the morale of this kidnapping story. Hey Kids, If you ever get dumped too close to the holidays, just steal somebody for a while and build a relationship on lies, maybe they'll fall in love with you!Yeah, that's about how much sense this whole film makes.Watch it if you want to stare at Mario Lopez for a while, he really can't act but he is rather pretty... and that's really all it's good for.",2,"""I hope you aren't expecting alot from Santa.
