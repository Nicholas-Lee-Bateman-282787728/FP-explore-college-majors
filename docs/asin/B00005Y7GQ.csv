I ask you to do this because you will probably never see this again.This was a sports film, for me to say that it wasn't would be a bold faced lie. This had all the characteristics of the modern Hollywood sports film, but what made it stand out and enjoyable is that it did not take itself seriously ... AND ... it had some amazing CGI action sequences. I recently watched a film called Equilibrium where it was mentioned that it could rival the popularity of The Matrix, well I would have to say that perhaps this film, Siu lam juk kau, would probably do more in toppling the king of bullet-time cinematography than Equilibrium would. I was impressed from the beginning till the end of this movie. The characters were all animated and individual in their own way. There was time used to set them up and learn about each of them. This wasn't one of those films where you spent most of your time with one of the characters then never really got to know the rest of them ... you knew them all and couldn't wait to see what they were going to bring to the table next. Hong Kong has crafted a spectacular film here. They have taken the popularity of the bullet-time effect and applied it to a genre that definitely needed a face-lift. I am surprised that America wasn't the first to do this, but we are a nation that loves the standard sports film, so why change what we love. PWFSSSST. We are so lazy sometimes.Siu lam juk kau tells a spectacular story coupled with some amazing graphics to create a story about love, teamwork, and superpowers. I also enjoyed the fact that this film also tried to say that kung-fu is not an old topic, that it can and should still be used in society today. When we think of the martial arts films (and physical aspect), we see them as a very old and dated genre. Well, let me be the first to say that they are coming back, and coming back with a vengeance. I enjoyed the fact that this was a revenge film. So many of our kung-fu films are revenge films, I was happy to see that this one was not far off. This film used techniques that I have not seen used in any other films. They took the old, skillful ways of the dated kung-fu film, added the work of bullet-time, and added the sports flare to it to create Siu lam juk kau.  It had us laughing, it kept us based in reality, and it focused my attention to the screen for the entire film (a task that no other sports film has been able to do). I think that by having your star also direct it (directed and starred Stephen Chow) it builds upon a sense of comfortability with the story. Chow is a master of slapstick, yet seldom overdoes the silliness, choosing carefully timed gags and meticulously mounted visual construction over slapdash comedy. The film is also no stranger to the bizarre, with Chow's multiple homages to Steven Spielberg, and a weird egg gag that I'm honestly shocked still remains the American cut of the picture.Overall, Siu lam juk kau is a amazing combination of comedy, action, romance, and dazzling soccer footage, forming an irresistible package to those looking for something they haven't seen before. We see that it is a personal story that everyone is having fun being a part of. That also helped this film ... the characters really wanted to be in this film and it shined like the North Star through our screen. The dubbing (which seemed off a couple times) only added delight to this film. Chow's Siu lam juk kau, is and will always be breathtaking.Grade: ***** out of *****",5,I hate sports movies.,1107907200,"02 9, 2005",2005,3555,"['What', 'wonderful', 'sports', 'film', 'STOP', 'read', 'line', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'ask', 'do', 'will', 'probably', 'never', 'see', 'again.This', 'was', 'sports', 'film', 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'would', 'be', 'bold', 'faced', 'lie', 'had', 'characteristics', 'modern', 'Hollywood', 'sports', 'film', 'what', 'made', 'stand', 'out', 'enjoyable', 'did', 'not', 'take', 'seriously', 'had', 'amazing', 'CGI', 'action', 'sequences', 'recently', 'watched', 'film', 'called', 'Equilibrium', 'where', 'was', 'mentioned', 'could', 'rival', 'popularity', 'Matrix', 'well', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'perhaps', 'film', 'Siu', 'juk', 'kau', 'would', 'probably', 'do', 'more', 'toppling', 'king', 'bullet-time', 'cinematography', 'Equilibrium', 'would', 'was', 'impressed', 'beginning', 'end', 'movie', 'characters', 'were', 'animated', 'individual', 'own', 'way', 'was', 'time', 'used', 'set', 'up', 'learn', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'films', 'where', 'spent', 'most', 'time', 'one', 'characters', 'then', 'never', 'really', 'got', 'know', 'rest', 'knew', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'were', 'going', 'bring', 'table', 'next', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'crafted', 'spectacular', 'film', 'here', 'have', 'taken', 'popularity', 'bullet-time', 'effect', 'applied', 'genre', 'definitely', 'needed', 'face-lift', 'am', 'surprised', 'America', 'was', ""n't"", 'first', 'do', 'are', 'nation', 'standard', 'sports', 'film', 'so', 'why', 'change', 'what', 'love', 'PWFSSSST', 'are', 'so', 'lazy', 'sometimes.Siu', 'lam', 'juk', 'kau', 'spectacular', 'story', 'coupled', 'amazing', 'graphics', 'create', 'story', 'love', 'teamwork', 'superpowers', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'fact', 'film', 'also', 'tried', 'say', 'kung-fu', 'not', 'old', 'topic', 'can', 'should', 'still', 'be', 'used', 'society', 'today', 'When', 'think', 'martial', 'arts', 'films', 'physical', 'aspect', 'see', 'very', 'old', 'dated', 'genre', 'Well', 'let', 'be', 'first', 'say', 'are', 'coming', 'back', 'coming', 'back', 'vengeance', 'enjoyed', 'fact', 'was', 'revenge', 'film', 'So', 'many', 'kung-fu', 'films', 'are', 'revenge', 'films', 'was', 'happy', 'see', 'one', 'was', 'not', 'far', 'off', 'film', 'used', 'techniques', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'used', 'other', 'films', 'took', 'old', 'skillful', 'ways', 'dated', 'kung-fu', 'film', 'added', 'work', 'bullet-time', 'added', 'sports', 'flare', 'create', 'Siu', 'lam', 'juk', 'kau', 'had', 'laughing', 'kept', 'based', 'reality', 'focused', 'attention', 'screen', 'entire', 'film', 'task', 'other', 'sports', 'film', 'been', 'able', 'do', 'think', 'having', 'star', 'also', 'direct', 'directed', 'starred', 'Stephen', 'Chow', 'sense', 'comfortability', 'story', 'Chow', 'master', 'slapstick', 'yet', 'seldom', 'silliness', 'choosing', 'carefully', 'timed', 'gags', 'meticulously', 'mounted', 'visual', 'construction', 'slapdash', 'comedy', 'film', 'also', 'no', 'stranger', 'bizarre', 'Chow', 'multiple', 'homages', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'weird', 'egg', 'gag', ""'m"", 'honestly', 'shocked', 'still', 'American', 'cut', 'picture.Overall', 'Siu', 'juk', 'kau', 'amazing', 'combination', 'comedy', 'action', 'romance', 'dazzling', 'soccer', 'footage', 'forming', 'irresistible', 'package', 'looking', 'something', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'see', 'personal', 'story', 'everyone', 'having', 'fun', 'being', 'part', 'also', 'helped', 'film', 'characters', 'really', 'wanted', 'be', 'film', 'shined', 'North', 'Star', 'screen', 'dubbing', 'seemed', 'off', 'couple', 'times', 'only', 'added', 'delight', 'film', 'Chow', 'Siu', 'lam', 'juk', 'kau', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'breathtaking.Grade', '*****', '*****']",Shaolin Soccer

Chow turns out to be a hilarious and creative star.  Who could have dreamed of something as goofy, infectious and, at the same time, as technically brilliant (the special effects are eye-popping) as Shaolin Soccer?  Now, I'm reading through the comments left here by Mr. Chow's longtime fans and I realize I'm going to have to check out some of his ""better works"" (as judged by these aficionados) like 'God of Cookery' and 'From Beijing with Love'.Not knowing what to expect from Shaolin Soccer, I found myself delightfully convulsed with laughter at two early points in the film:- An impromptu synchronized 'street' rendition of the Kool and the Gang hit 'Celebration.'  This is almost impossible to explain.  When it took shape in the movie, I literally mouthed the words ""What the...?""  Truly inspired.- A second muscial number, in which two of the Shaolin 'brothers' take to the stage in an ill-fated cabaret act.  While I'm sure this was even funnier in Cantonese, even the wonderfully descriptive subtitles demonstrated the amateur campiness of their performance (which was exactly Chow's point).Plus, for any soccer/football fan the depictions of the in-game events are a joy.

689513,A2YXMN40D7WTGP,B00005Y7GQ,casualsuede,"[0, 0]","Director Stephen Chow plays a down on his luck Shaolin monk turned street bum named Sing in the chinese soccer version of Ladybugs, Major league, Bad News Bears and other movies where mitfits can become winners against an evil opponent.The story actually starts off with a tournament 20 years earlier with a confrontation between teammates ""Golden Leg"" Fung and Hung. Fung is the arrogant hero that misses the free kick at a crucial game and is attacked by the crowd. 20 years later Hung is now the boss of a National Soccer tournament and Fung is his lackey that is soon fired.Fung and Sing meet and at first Fung doesn't see the purpose of integrating Shaolin Kung Fu into a soccer tournament, but after seeing him in action against a group of thugs, he quickly changes his mind. Sing gathers his usual suspects, a group of ex-shaolin monks that have moved on with their life. There is a Bruce Lee lookalike that is umemployed, a stock broker who can suck a ball into his lap, a huge 200 lb grocery stock boy who can jump 50 feet at a time, a janitor who can breakdance with a soccer ball and a nightclub lackey who has an iron head, which comes in handy since the owner always seems to be smashing a bottle over his head for his incompetence.The group enter the National Soccer tournament and at first practice, they suck. However, as they improve, they become the team to beat and Hung is getting worried that his Steroid/Chemical enhanced team won't be up to par to win the $1M prize. More importantly, will Sing's goal to make Shaolin Kung Fu more famous succeed?As you can see, the plot of this movie is secondary to each individual scene. As vignettes, this movie does very well. Stephen Chow is charismatic as Sing and his love interest Mui is also appropriately meek. However, the relationship is flawed from the beginning. There is chemistry spart between them, and Chow has to work on it real hard in order to make it work.There are other comedic points that seem strange to Western Audiences. The cross dressing hair-dresser scene seems completely out of place, as is the fact that Mui accepts mid-80's shoulder pad fashion as ""in"". To someone who's been to Hong Kong, that just doesn't make sense. It also doesn't make sense for two soccer players (Karen Mok and Cecillia Cheung) to be wearing moustaches and beards, but maybe that's a cultural thing.The SFX is also hit and miss. Of course, this is a lower budget movies, so some scenes, especially to do with bodies flying through the air, don't work and look really fake. However, some other scenes, especially during the soccer games are not so bad and actually exciting to watch. The final game is also the pinnacle of the movie, because they actually meet their match against guys straight out of the ""Universal Soldier"" movies.It is a good movie that appeals to Eastern tastes more than anything and while Miramax seems to have bought the international rights to this movie, I don't see it having wide appeal to non-Asian audiences (especially to those people who couldn't accept the movie ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"").

689518,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B00005Y7GQ,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[49, 53]","I had heard about Shaolin Soccer (2001) a couple of years ago from a friend, as he had recommended it to me, knowing the particular way some of my tastes ran, and I am glad he did, as it's a heady mix of the wacky, the absurd, and the just plain fun.  The movie starts off with a flashback, showing an extremely popular Chinese soccer player named Golden Leg Fung accepting money to throw a game from a lackey, and the consequences of his actions, including a severely crippling beating by the crowd after purposely missing a rather easy goal scoring opportunity.  Now, it's many years later, and Fung now works for the gangster organization that had originally paid him off, in a completely demeaning position.  He dreams of coaching, but the once lackey who owns the current champion soccer team and is also chairman of the league, finds this notion completely humorous, and heap further degradations upon Fung.  Despondent, Fung ends up meeting a vagabond/shaolin follower called Steel Leg, and formulates a plan to build a new soccer team around this exceptional martial artist.  Fung also finds out Steel Leg has enough brothers, all once trained in martial arts, to make up a team.  Each brother has their own, unique ability, and soon they begin to practice.  During their first practice, the men suffer a fairly brutal beating (this whole pain, beating, and humiliation factor seems to be a constant theme throughout), but soon find their shaolin training coming back to them, and turn the tables on their opponents.  They enter the tournament, sweeping through the ranks, until finally the meet with the current champions, the Evil Team (I'm not kidding, that's their name), and meet the ultimate challenge, as the chairman gives his team a decidedly unfair advantage.  Will the shaolin players be victorious, or will they suffer the crushing defeat at the hands of the chairman and his evil team?The special effects here are truly amazing and inventive, making for the most insane soccer playing I've ever seen.  Imagine someone being able to kick a soccer ball with the same force of shooting it out of a cannon, and with pinpoint accuracy.  There is not really a lot of actual soccer playing, in the traditional sense, as with the abilities of the players, the ball mainly zooms around in a very cartoonish manner.  Mixing kung fu and soccer is certainly and interesting concept, and provides some really spectacular visuals.  The English captioning is really bad, but certainly gave me much to laugh about, along with the seriously outlandish overacting.Special features include an option to watch the film with the deleted scenes, the deleted scenes by themselves, a trailer, biographies, a featurette on the making of the film, a photo gallery, and behind the scenes featurette on how the special effects were made.  All in all, Shaolin Soccer is an unsane, over the top comedy steeped in outrageous action and definitely worth a look if you care to expand your horizons.Cookieman108",4,Bend it Like Golden Leg Fung,1082160000,"04 17, 2004",2004,2998,"['had', 'heard', 'Shaolin', 'Soccer', '2001', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'friend', 'had', 'recommended', 'knowing', 'particular', 'way', 'tastes', 'ran', 'am', 'glad', 'did', 'heady', 'mix', 'wacky', 'absurd', 'just', 'plain', 'fun', 'movie', 'flashback', 'showing', 'extremely', 'popular', 'Chinese', 'soccer', 'player', 'named', 'Golden', 'Leg', 'Fung', 'accepting', 'money', 'throw', 'game', 'lackey', 'consequences', 'actions', 'including', 'severely', 'crippling', 'beating', 'crowd', 'purposely', 'missing', 'rather', 'easy', 'goal', 'scoring', 'opportunity', 'Now', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'Fung', 'now', 'gangster', 'organization', 'had', 'originally', 'paid', 'off', 'completely', 'demeaning', 'position', 'coaching', 'once', 'lackey', 'who', 'current', 'champion', 'soccer', 'team', 'also', 'chairman', 'league', 'notion', 'completely', 'humorous', 'heap', 'further', 'degradations', 'Fung', 'Despondent', 'Fung', 'up', 'meeting', 'vagabond/shaolin', 'follower', 'called', 'Steel', 'Leg', 'plan', 'build', 'new', 'soccer', 'team', 'exceptional', 'martial', 'artist', 'Fung', 'also', 'out', 'Steel', 'Leg', 'enough', 'brothers', 'once', 'trained', 'martial', 'arts', 'make', 'up', 'team', 'brother', 'own', 'unique', 'ability', 'soon', 'begin', 'practice', 'first', 'practice', 'men', 'suffer', 'fairly', 'brutal', 'beating', 'whole', 'pain', 'beating', 'humiliation', 'factor', 'be', 'constant', 'theme', 'soon', 'find', 'shaolin', 'training', 'coming', 'back', 'turn', 'tables', 'opponents', 'enter', 'tournament', 'sweeping', 'ranks', 'finally', 'meet', 'current', 'champions', 'Evil', 'Team', ""'m"", 'not', 'kidding', 'name', 'meet', 'ultimate', 'challenge', 'chairman', 'team', 'decidedly', 'unfair', 'advantage', 'Will', 'shaolin', 'players', 'be', 'victorious', 'will', 'suffer', 'crushing', 'defeat', 'hands', 'chairman', 'evil', 'team', 'special', 'effects', 'here', 'are', 'truly', 'amazing', 'inventive', 'making', 'most', 'insane', 'soccer', 'playing', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Imagine', 'someone', 'being', 'able', 'kick', 'soccer', 'ball', 'same', 'force', 'shooting', 'cannon', 'pinpoint', 'accuracy', 'not', 'really', 'lot', 'actual', 'soccer', 'playing', 'traditional', 'sense', 'abilities', 'players', 'ball', 'mainly', 'around', 'very', 'cartoonish', 'manner', 'Mixing', 'kung', 'fu', 'soccer', 'certainly', 'interesting', 'concept', 'really', 'spectacular', 'visuals', 'English', 'captioning', 'really', 'bad', 'certainly', 'gave', 'much', 'laugh', 'about', 'seriously', 'outlandish', 'overacting.Special', 'features', 'include', 'option', 'watch', 'film', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'trailer', 'biographies', 'featurette', 'making', 'film', 'photo', 'gallery', 'scenes', 'featurette', 'how', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'made', 'Shaolin', 'Soccer', 'unsane', 'top', 'comedy', 'steeped', 'outrageous', 'action', 'definitely', 'look', 'care', 'expand', 'horizons.Cookieman108']",Shaolin Soccer

689522,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00005Y7GQ,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[0, 0]","Shaolin Soccer makes for perfectly ridiculous fun when a team of down and out kung fu masters coalesce around a degraded legend turned coach to take the sport of Chinese soccer to new heights (literally).  For twenty years, Golden Leg Fung (Man Tat Ng) has limped around in the service of Team Evil Coach Hung (Yin Tse) waiting for his chance to be a coach, only to be ridiculed and driven away.  Then he meets a poor kung fu master out on the streets and, after seeing what incredible leg power the fellow has, comes up with the crazy idea of forming a soccer team of kung fu masters.  Mighty Steel Leg Sing (Stephen Chow), who had been looking for a way to spread kung fu teachings among more of the populace, quickly seeks out his former Shaolin brothers, none of whom are interested - at first.  Eventually, the new dream team is assembled.  There's Iron Shirt Tin, Iron Head, a very hefty Light Weight, Lightning Hands, and Hooking Leg (each of them named after his particular kung fu specialty).  They don't know the first thing about soccer, and Golden Leg has a time trying to coach them up in time to enter the big, upcoming soccer tournament.  Just when everything appears lost, the guys' kung fu powers are reawakened, and it's Game On from that point on.  They aren't exactly intimidating when they come out in their yellow bathrobes, each one of them less athletic-looking than the next, but it's immediately obvious that these guys, with their high-flying, ball-screeching skills, are a force to be reckoned with.  They are most definitely a sight to see.There's one more kung fu master in town, a shy young woman named Mui (Zhao Wei) who has no self-confidence and works making sticky buns (using kung fu, of course).  Might Steel Leg Sing befriends her, and there's a weird kind of romance between the two, but their weird relationship is sort of a weak spot in the story - although Mui herself is certainly a character of great importance.  The film is really just about absurdly unreal kung fu soccer moves on (and above) the field and their culmination in the championship game between Team Evil and our beloved Shaolin Soccer Team.  Hung, never above cheating, manages to put a team on the field that can actually outmatch the seemingly invincible kung fu soccer team, making it a contest unlike any you've ever seen before.  CGI effects aplenty accompany each and every move on the field, serious injuries abound, and the enthusiastic crowd loves every minute of it.  You'll see soccer play that even Pele could not have dreamed of (largely because it's all physically impossible) in this ultimate battle of good and evil.  There's never really much doubt about how things will end, but that doesn't take away from any of the zany super-soccer special effects that make this the most exciting soccer game in history.Shaolin Soccer is funny by design, and the key to making such a film is to go all out with the special effects.  That's exactly what Stephen Chow does in this hilarious blend of soccer, kung fu, and comedy.  Even when it takes on a distinctly cartoonish air, Shaolin Soccer proves more entertaining by the moment.  With its constant humor and spectacular special effects, the film all but guarantees that a good time will be had by all.",4,"Combine kung fu and soccer, and you get a very funny film",1135209600,"12 22, 2005",2005,3273,"['Shaolin', 'Soccer', 'perfectly', 'ridiculous', 'fun', 'when', 'team', 'down', 'kung', 'fu', 'masters', 'coalesce', 'degraded', 'legend', 'turned', 'coach', 'take', 'sport', 'Chinese', 'soccer', 'new', 'heights', 'literally', 'twenty', 'years', 'Golden', 'Leg', 'Fung', 'Man', 'Tat', 'Ng', 'limped', 'service', 'Team', 'Evil', 'Coach', 'Hung', 'Yin', 'Tse', 'waiting', 'chance', 'be', 'coach', 'only', 'be', 'ridiculed', 'driven', 'away', 'Then', 'poor', 'kung', 'fu', 'master', 'out', 'streets', 'seeing', 'what', 'incredible', 'leg', 'power', 'fellow', 'up', 'crazy', 'idea', 'forming', 'soccer', 'team', 'kung', 'fu', 'masters', 'Mighty', 'Steel', 'Leg', 'Sing', 'Stephen', 'Chow', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'looking', 'way', 'spread', 'kung', 'fu', 'teachings', 'more', 'populace', 'quickly', 'out', 'former', 'Shaolin', 'brothers', 'none', 'whom', 'are', 'interested', 'first', 'Eventually', 'new', 'dream', 'team', 'assembled', 'Iron', 'Shirt', 'Tin', 'Iron', 'Head', 'very', 'hefty', 'Light', 'Weight', 'Lightning', 'Hands', 'Hooking', 'Leg', 'named', 'particular', 'kung', 'fu', 'specialty', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'first', 'thing', 'soccer', 'Golden', 'Leg', 'time', 'trying', 'coach', 'up', 'time', 'enter', 'big', 'upcoming', 'soccer', 'tournament', 'Just', 'when', 'everything', 'lost', 'guys', 'kung', 'fu', 'powers', 'are', 'reawakened', 'Game', 'point', 'are', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'intimidating', 'when', 'come', 'out', 'yellow', 'bathrobes', 'one', 'less', 'athletic-looking', 'next', 'immediately', 'obvious', 'guys', 'high-flying', 'ball-screeching', 'skills', 'are', 'force', 'be', 'reckoned', 'are', 'most', 'definitely', 'sight', 'see.There', 'one', 'more', 'kung', 'fu', 'master', 'town', 'shy', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Mui', 'Zhao', 'Wei', 'who', 'self-confidence', 'making', 'sticky', 'buns', 'using', 'kung', 'fu', 'course', 'Might', 'Steel', 'Leg', 'Sing', 'weird', 'kind', 'romance', 'two', 'weird', 'relationship', 'sort', 'weak', 'spot', 'story', 'Mui', 'certainly', 'character', 'great', 'importance', 'film', 'really', 'just', 'absurdly', 'unreal', 'kung', 'fu', 'soccer', 'moves', 'above', 'field', 'culmination', 'championship', 'game', 'Team', 'Evil', 'beloved', 'Shaolin', 'Soccer', 'Team', 'Hung', 'never', 'cheating', 'put', 'team', 'field', 'can', 'actually', 'outmatch', 'seemingly', 'invincible', 'kung', 'fu', 'soccer', 'team', 'making', 'contest', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'before', 'CGI', 'effects', 'aplenty', 'move', 'field', 'serious', 'injuries', 'abound', 'enthusiastic', 'crowd', 'loves', 'minute', ""'ll"", 'see', 'soccer', 'play', 'even', 'Pele', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'dreamed', 'largely', 'physically', 'impossible', 'ultimate', 'battle', 'good', 'evil', 'never', 'really', 'much', 'doubt', 'how', 'things', 'will', 'end', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'zany', 'super-soccer', 'special', 'effects', 'make', 'most', 'exciting', 'soccer', 'game', 'history.Shaolin', 'Soccer', 'funny', 'design', 'key', 'making', 'such', 'film', 'go', 'special', 'effects', 'exactly', 'what', 'Stephen', 'Chow', 'hilarious', 'blend', 'soccer', 'kung', 'fu', 'comedy', 'Even', 'when', 'distinctly', 'cartoonish', 'air', 'Shaolin', 'Soccer', 'more', 'entertaining', 'moment', 'constant', 'humor', 'spectacular', 'special', 'effects', 'film', 'guarantees', 'good', 'time', 'will', 'be', 'had']",Shaolin Soccer

We obtained a copy and were delighted.  Shaolin Soccer is fresh, funny and the special effects are great; it was better than Kung Pow and not nearly as cheesy.  Stephen Chow spoofs films from the Matrix to Kill Bill in his own inimitable Chinese way.  The story takes place in Asia, where main character Sing leaves his shaolin temple to seek his way in the world, specifically in the world of soccer.  His foot of steel and bad shoes leave indelible impressions on those he meets---and beats---along his journey to the world cup games.  He unwittingly captures the heart of a young woman and remains blissfully ignorant of her attraction to him, even when she repairs his tattered shoes with cute little Japanese animal stickers and patches.  The bad guys crop up predictably enough, but are nasty and it's great to see them gloat first and lose later.  The best scenes involve the other shaolin brothers when they emerge from their spiritual seclusion to join Sing in his quest for a championship.  Our family really enjoyed this movie and are glad we made the investment to own it.  It's a real pity that the film never made it big in the USA.

Most HK films are grainy and greenishly dark, plus they are edited in weird ways.  (Admitted I haven't seen many HK movies but the ones I've seen always made me feel motionsick afterwards.)  The visuals on this film, on the other hand, are clean and well-balanced, with good color tones, albeit a bit high on the orange/yellow side.The storyline is interesting but uneven at places.  The first hour of the 100-minute film is about how the players come together to form the team, and then the final match for the rest of the film.  There are a lot of funny moments, but also some jokes that could baffle a Western viewer.  Furthermore, there's a lot of oblique references to homosexuality, such as when the fat boy eats his precious chicken eggs off the stockbroker guy, and an unnecessarily excessive amount of male leg exposes.  A few scenes are superfluous and make the first half boring at times (e.g., the bar scene).The movie is dominated by computer-generated special effects.  A &quot;making of&quot; featurette reveals much of the action was filmed with blue screens.  But I have to say the effects are quite good, and more refreshing than the stuff put out by Hollywood these days.  Most of the human-computer action sequences are well spliced together and therefore enjoyable.Overall, Shaolin Soccer is an enjoyable film for every comedy fan, but especially for the martial arts and soccer crowds.  The HK version I saw feels uneven in many places, maybe that's why the U.S. theatrical release has been pushed back again and again.

689535,A17IW44FV0HUTY,B00005Y7GQ,Glen Engel Cox,"[0, 1]","I was out with some buddies this past Tuesday and, for some reason, the talk turned to what was the worst and the best comic book movie. I maintain that the best is Unbreakable, but the others wanted to limit the selection to movies that were adaptations of comics rather than simply movies that captured the underlying myths and tropes of the genre (which, typically, means superheroes, at least in the U.S.). The best adaptation that I know of is probably Spiderman, although X-Men is very close. I personally despise Burton's Batman. Although I understand my friend Matt Cutter's argument that it is Burton's Batman, I can't get over the problem that he allows actors to step outside of the roles they are supposed to be playing, making it as much of a wink-and-a-nod to the meta set rather than a faithful adaptation. I haven't seen Nolan's Batman Begins (it's in my netflix queue though), although I've heard good things about it, nor have I seen Sin City. Hellboy did a great job of capturing the look and feel of the comic that it was drawn from, but I just didn't think it was all that good of a movie.Stephen Chow's Shaolin SoccerWhich brings us to Shaolin Soccer, which would have my vote for the best movie adapted from a manga, if only it had been. Instead, trivia has it that creator and star Stephen Chow had been inspired by an animated television series on soccer called ""Captain Tsubasa,"" which may, for all I know, have been based on a manga series. Whatever, the visual effects and broad humor of the movie perfectly capture the style of manga, from the exaggerated facial expressions that Chow and his co-stars make, to the way that the soccer ball tears up the ground and grass and can blowback people in its power. The best scene, by far, is the climatic goal defense, where Mui adapts a kung fu stance and a wavering yin/yang symbol appears in the air before her while the attacking player has an evil demon in the air above him that he draws into the ball itself, which then flies through the air so fast that it becomes a fireball.I found the movie much funnier than J did, and I'm not sure exactly why. Perhaps it's because I'm more familiar with manga and the style of humor that the movie used, which is more disjointed than a Western comedy, with flights of imagination that rival Amelie in their elaborateness (such as the break into a dance sequence straight out of a music video early on).

689537,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B00005Y7GQ,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","I'm late to the party but let me jump on that bandwagon anyway. SHAOLIN SOCCER is when Stephen Chow first made big noise, to which he quickly capitalized with the brilliant KUNG FU HUSTLE. And I guess I'll go off on a brief tangent and just call him out for not having done much lately. Dude was already a name in Hong Kong, but SHAOLIN SOCCER is what put him on the world stage.Stephen Chow borrows from Jackie Chan's schtick and improves on it, infusing SHAOLIN SOCCER with broad humor, dazzling martial arts, and even a wacky musical number. It's huge fun, and unlike Jackie's habit of exhibiting clownish expressions, Stephen consistently maintains a deadpan demeanor which I think makes his comedy more effective. Stephen Chow plays ""Mighty Steel Leg"" Sing, a scruffy cleaner and post-graduate student whose ambition is to make Shaolin kung fu accessible to the masses. And he regards the game of soccer as the means to achieving this. Under the tutelage of disgraced ex-soccer star Fung a.k.a. ""Golden Leg,"" Mighty Steel Leg and his reunited motley band of fellow Shaolin Temple alums parlay their kung fu training onto the soccer field. And while the film takes its sweet time to get these reluctant players on the field, once they do, it generates this exhilarating momentum. You can take or leave Chow's patented cinematic ticks but there's no denying the masterful visual effects that come into play. We get treated to some wildly spectacular sight gags.The story takes time to introduce its characters and their sordidness, and this lends a rooting interest for the viewer. Ultimately, it's Fung who provides the film's emotional anchor, with Stephen Chow wrangling the most showy role. But the most endearing character, for my  money, is the unsvelte Iron Head, played by Wong Yat Fei, an actor who has a way with physical comedy. Vicki Zhao plays the sympathetic role of Mui, the painfully shy girl whose bakery-fu is most excellent and whose tai chi goalie skills are, as we learn, very formidable. But Mui's delectable steam buns are what inspire a musical number.As Mighty Steel Leg goes about recruiting his Shaolin brothers, it's readily apparent that these slovenly blokes have neglected their kung fu. So cue the amusing training montages, all this to prep the team to cut a swath thru national soccer competition and on to a championship showdown with the dreaded Team Evil, a crew what had won the Super Cup five years running and is fueled by (if you're watching the original Chinese version) ""evil American drugs.""If you haven't seen SHAOLIN SOCCER or KUNG FU HUSTLE, you're in for something you've never seen before, something bordering on the surreal. Stephen Chow specializes in offbeat martial arts flights of fancy. I love the little touches he injects, from the goalie (not Mui) clad in the classic yellow Bruce Lee track suit to that little bit that Mui does as the musical number abruptly ends to Mui's hilarious fail which has her reporting to the other team's goal post, to the shame of her teammates. This DVD allows for the option to see the film either in its American version or in the original Chinese version. Except you should see it in the original Chinese version which has a running time of 112 minutes as opposed to the severely edited 87 minutes long American version. The American version is also minus the closing outtakes.",5,The deadly gooooooaaaaaaaal of kung fu,1320105600,"11 1, 2011",2011,3371,"[""'m"", 'late', 'party', 'let', 'jump', 'bandwagon', 'anyway', 'SHAOLIN', 'SOCCER', 'when', 'Stephen', 'Chow', 'first', 'made', 'big', 'noise', 'quickly', 'capitalized', 'brilliant', 'KUNG', 'FU', 'HUSTLE', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'go', 'off', 'brief', 'tangent', 'just', 'call', 'out', 'not', 'having', 'done', 'much', 'lately', 'Dude', 'was', 'already', 'name', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'SHAOLIN', 'SOCCER', 'what', 'put', 'world', 'stage.Stephen', 'Chow', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'schtick', 'infusing', 'SHAOLIN', 'SOCCER', 'broad', 'humor', 'dazzling', 'martial', 'arts', 'even', 'wacky', 'musical', 'number', 'huge', 'fun', 'Jackie', 'habit', 'exhibiting', 'clownish', 'expressions', 'Stephen', 'consistently', 'deadpan', 'demeanor', 'think', 'comedy', 'more', 'effective', 'Stephen', 'Chow', 'Mighty', 'Steel', 'Leg', 'Sing', 'scruffy', 'cleaner', 'post-graduate', 'student', 'ambition', 'make', 'Shaolin', 'kung', 'fu', 'accessible', 'masses', 'game', 'soccer', 'means', 'achieving', 'tutelage', 'disgraced', 'ex-soccer', 'star', 'Fung', 'a.k.a', 'Golden', 'Leg', 'Mighty', 'Steel', 'Leg', 'reunited', 'motley', 'band', 'fellow', 'Shaolin', 'Temple', 'alums', 'parlay', 'kung', 'fu', 'training', 'soccer', 'field', 'film', 'sweet', 'time', 'get', 'reluctant', 'players', 'field', 'once', 'do', 'exhilarating', 'momentum', 'can', 'take', 'leave', 'Chow', 'patented', 'cinematic', 'ticks', 'denying', 'masterful', 'visual', 'effects', 'come', 'play', 'get', 'treated', 'wildly', 'spectacular', 'sight', 'gags.The', 'story', 'time', 'introduce', 'characters', 'sordidness', 'rooting', 'interest', 'viewer', 'Ultimately', 'Fung', 'who', 'film', 'emotional', 'anchor', 'Stephen', 'Chow', 'wrangling', 'most', 'showy', 'role', 'most', 'endearing', 'character', 'money', 'unsvelte', 'Iron', 'Head', 'played', 'Wong', 'Yat', 'Fei', 'actor', 'who', 'way', 'physical', 'comedy', 'Vicki', 'Zhao', 'sympathetic', 'role', 'Mui', 'painfully', 'shy', 'girl', 'bakery-fu', 'most', 'excellent', 'tai', 'chi', 'goalie', 'skills', 'are', 'learn', 'very', 'formidable', 'Mui', 'delectable', 'steam', 'buns', 'are', 'what', 'inspire', 'musical', 'number.As', 'Mighty', 'Steel', 'Leg', 'recruiting', 'Shaolin', 'brothers', 'readily', 'apparent', 'slovenly', 'blokes', 'have', 'neglected', 'kung', 'fu', 'So', 'cue', 'amusing', 'training', 'montages', 'prep', 'team', 'cut', 'swath', 'thru', 'national', 'soccer', 'competition', 'championship', 'showdown', 'dreaded', 'Team', 'Evil', 'crew', 'what', 'had', 'won', 'Super', 'Cup', 'five', 'years', 'running', 'fueled', ""'re"", 'watching', 'original', 'Chinese', 'version', 'evil', 'American', 'drugs', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'SHAOLIN', 'SOCCER', 'KUNG', 'FU', 'HUSTLE', ""'re"", 'something', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'something', 'bordering', 'surreal', 'Stephen', 'Chow', 'offbeat', 'martial', 'arts', 'flights', 'fancy', 'love', 'little', 'touches', 'goalie', 'not', 'Mui', 'clad', 'classic', 'yellow', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'track', 'suit', 'little', 'bit', 'Mui', 'musical', 'number', 'abruptly', 'Mui', 'hilarious', 'fail', 'reporting', 'other', 'team', 'goal', 'post', 'shame', 'teammates', 'DVD', 'option', 'see', 'film', 'either', 'American', 'version', 'original', 'Chinese', 'version', 'should', 'see', 'original', 'Chinese', 'version', 'running', 'time', '112', 'minutes', 'opposed', 'severely', 'edited', '87', 'minutes', 'long', 'American', 'version', 'American', 'version', 'also', 'minus', 'closing', 'outtakes']",Shaolin Soccer

689541,A3PJQ4742VN84H,B00005Y7GQ,"Hope this helps ""help""","[1, 1]","""Shaolin Soccer"" is just one of those films you should never go into expecting some great, ground breaking cinema.  Just look at the title, can we really expect much?  But, with all that, it is still a very entertaining and unique film with a wonderful premise and awesome action...and even some amazing lessons to be learned along the way.  This is, in many ways, ""The Little Giants"" if they were older and Asian.FOR CONCERNED PARENTS AND FOLKS:You really don't have much to worry about.  No sex, no nudity, only comic violence (this is soccer...and a martial arts flick), no real innuendos (the only instance that can be taken that way isn't really if taken in context...it's the egg scene if you want to look that up).  All in all, it's safe and sound.PLOT (NO SPOILERS):The basic premise is ""what would happen if a poor, rundown (but aspiring) Kung Fu practitioner ran into a soccer coach?""  There's not much else to it as far as the complete story arc is concerned.  But it is executed convincingly (for what it is) and very well.  Tinge of romance, issues of letting fame and wealth go to your head, themes of controlled strength abound in the film.  Expect to see a lot of old school martial arts idioms...some of which are intentionally exaggerated for affect.  The pacing is quite slow and gradual though...this is definitely still an Asian film and not a comedic Jim Carey film.  Still, the film was very creatively done with many funny moments that had me rolling.CHINESE ORIGINAL FILM CUT VS US THEATRICAL:Ok, it should be noted that the DVD carries both the original Chinese cut of the film as well as the US theatrical cut.  Only the US cut has English dubs to go with it.  Well, I'm on the fence with this.  It's cool to hear the Chinese...but it's also hilarious to have the English dubs.  With the English Dubs, it plays just like the classic ""bad dubs"" of early martial arts films...and it seems quite intentional.  Still, in the end, though I've seen both, I would greatly recommend watching the Chinese original cut, since it fills in gaps in the story much more.ALL IN ALL:This is a fun and amazingly humorous light film.  It does have some touching moments and great and deeper lessons...but is very much slapstick through an through.  It is important to note, again, that some may be turned off by its slower pace.  Still, it should be seen at least once.",3,Kun Fu makes the world go round,1344297600,"08 7, 2012",2012,2378,"['Shaolin', 'Soccer', 'just', 'one', 'films', 'should', 'never', 'go', 'expecting', 'great', 'ground', 'breaking', 'cinema', 'Just', 'look', 'title', 'can', 'really', 'expect', 'much', 'still', 'very', 'entertaining', 'unique', 'film', 'wonderful', 'premise', 'awesome', 'action', 'even', 'amazing', 'lessons', 'be', 'learned', 'way', 'many', 'ways', 'Little', 'Giants', 'were', 'older', 'Asian.FOR', 'CONCERNED', 'PARENTS', 'FOLKS', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'worry', 'about', 'sex', 'nudity', 'only', 'comic', 'violence', 'soccer', 'martial', 'arts', 'flick', 'real', 'innuendos', 'only', 'instance', 'can', 'be', 'taken', 'way', ""n't"", 'really', 'taken', 'context', 'egg', 'scene', 'want', 'look', 'up', 'safe', 'sound.PLOT', 'NO', 'SPOILERS', 'basic', 'premise', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'poor', 'rundown', 'aspiring', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'practitioner', 'ran', 'soccer', 'coach', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'as', 'far', 'complete', 'story', 'arc', 'concerned', 'executed', 'convincingly', 'what', 'very', 'well', 'Tinge', 'romance', 'issues', 'letting', 'fame', 'wealth', 'go', 'head', 'themes', 'controlled', 'strength', 'abound', 'film', 'Expect', 'see', 'lot', 'old', 'school', 'martial', 'arts', 'idioms', 'are', 'intentionally', 'exaggerated', 'affect', 'pacing', 'quite', 'slow', 'gradual', 'though', 'definitely', 'still', 'Asian', 'film', 'not', 'comedic', 'Jim', 'Carey', 'film', 'Still', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'creatively', 'done', 'many', 'funny', 'moments', 'had', 'rolling.CHINESE', 'ORIGINAL', 'FILM', 'CUT', 'VS', 'US', 'THEATRICAL', 'Ok', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'DVD', 'original', 'Chinese', 'cut', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'US', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'Only', 'US', 'cut', 'English', 'dubs', 'go', 'Well', ""'m"", 'fence', 'cool', 'hear', 'Chinese', 'also', 'hilarious', 'have', 'English', 'dubs', 'English', 'Dubs', 'just', 'classic', 'bad', 'dubs', 'early', 'martial', 'arts', 'films', 'quite', 'intentional', 'Still', 'end', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'would', 'greatly', 'recommend', 'watching', 'Chinese', 'original', 'cut', 'gaps', 'story', 'much', 'more.ALL', 'IN', 'ALL', 'fun', 'amazingly', 'humorous', 'light', 'film', 'have', 'touching', 'moments', 'great', 'deeper', 'lessons', 'very', 'much', 'slapstick', 'important', 'note', 'again', 'may', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'slower', 'pace', 'Still', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'least', 'once']",Shaolin Soccer

He has given each character a personality of its own; just to create comedy, with a humor that is sometimes honest and others rough. It has some great comedy moments although, coming from the characters, very peculiar ones.It basically all comes from the characters. You have different persons, united by one thing: Shaolin Kung-Fu. And then you have one man, with one passion: Soccer. This premise helps to create human emotions in the characters. They all have a past that, for some reason, want to forget. Except one of them, who could be living in the past, and still thinks in the goodness of Shaolin Kung-Fu. He believes in it so much, that he gives speeches to people about the qualities of his culture, and the improvement it could do in society. He is right, and sooner or later, she will remind these things to some people, and they will all remember. They will all be prepared to get together again.What a good-hearted film this is, and how it is filmed, it's beyond imagination. You will find special effects from other world. In occasions, these will seem slow for you, and you will think they are not well managed or handled; but then you will watch. Watching will make you connect all the elements of the story, to make it one. In elements I include special effects, and say again: they couldn't be done better, especially in a movie like this one.The entire cast did a wonderful job in their roles by giving their characters the personal development they need. They are not playing the most complex people in the world, but they still know what characters they're playing. Some of the scenes, such as the first time we see Mui making bread, are absolute genius; so funny that you can't help but to laugh. I felt Mui seemed like she should have been in more of the film, and I've read that a lot of her part got cut out of the American release, which is a shame. A number of people are saying the original is vastly superior to the edited U.S. version, but this version is so great that I would be mightily impressed if that were true.The idea of this movie is ingenious, using the style of extravagant martial arts films in a soccer movie, and is done beautifully. You will probably find something you've seen before, I can't deny that. You will find the ending you expect, the situations you imagine, the resolutions you anticipate, or not. You'll have the old coach, the person with the dreams and the heart, the girl; it's just that you'll have them differently (you'll realize what I mean).

689549,A2VWPJGE6YSGAN,B00005Y7GQ,Kurgan,"[0, 0]","I must say this is a unique film. It's filled with a whimsical sense of humor with moments of genuine pathos, emotion and excitement. Basically this combines some of the best of sports movies and martial arts movies and spoofs them both.Ostensibly set in 1980's China, a half dozen former shaolin monks are brought together by a sincere and idealistic young leader and taught by their coach, a former star player also down on his luck after he threw the game for a corrupt boss and got his leg broken by a mob. Stephen Chow's lead character knows little more in life than kung fu, but tries to make the lives of people around him better including that of a young woman who bakes sweet buns he chances to meet one day.The film is short, doesn't take itself too seriously, and is full of great lines and lots of fun wire work and special effects. I can't say much more about this film except that it has to be seen to be believed. There are also lots of references to other blockbuster films like the Matrix, Jurassic Park and Saving Private Ryan sprinkled throughout.The action is slapstick and there's a quick moment where one of the players gets his clothes blown off in comic fashion (only seen from the back for a second), so it's for more mature audiences with a good sense of humor.There are few modern movies like Shaolin Soccer.

Imagine if the Matrix took place inside an 8-bit NES Super Dodge Ball cartridge, or if &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; were crossbred with &quot;Solarbabies.&quot;  Stephen Chow, the director and star of this film, is a comedic genius on the level of David Cross during the Mr. Show days, or Ben Stiller at his top cinematic form (Mystery Men, for example).  In it, he plays an ever-optimistic kung-fu student who is desperately trying to reintroduce the ancient arts to a jaded world of cellphones and jetliners.  A chance meeting with a once-famous soccer star, now elderly and crippled, sets up the plot for one of the most well-executed and hilarious kung-fu movies of all time: the two conspire to combine kung-fu with soccer, creating a nigh-invincible team of superhumans.  This was obviously Chow's largest budget movie to date, as the special effects are on par with American films, but even without that extra boost the story would carry on just as well as it does in his other films (such as &quot;God of Cookery&quot;).

Tresca ""Talien""","[1, 1]","""Shaolin Soccer"" updates the traditional high fantasy martial arts movie that dominated the 80s by infusing it with modern sensibilities. It's gleefully dumb and knows it, filling the on-screen acrobatic antics with a winking nod to its predecessors.Arch villainous soccer league manager Hung (Patrick Tse Yin) convinced the soccer star Fung (Ng Man Tat) known as ""Golden Leg"" to throw a championship game. Hung now leads Team Evil - you read that right, Team Evil - and after years of service he fires Fung from his entourage. Disgraced and now lame, Fung plans to field a rival team. That rival team begins with ""Steel Leg"" Sing (Stephen Chow), a Shaolin Kung Fu master determined to bring the ancient system of martial arts to everyday life. Steel Leg sets out to reunite with his martial arts brethren and bring glory to Shaolin.The brothers include Iron Shirt Tin (Kai Man Tin), Light Weight (Chi Chung Lam), Lightning Hands (Kwok-Kwan Chan), Hooking Leg (Mei Lin Mo), and Iron Head (Won Yut Fei). All of them have a talent that is both humorous and breathtaking. Iron Shirt can hold any soccer ball in his gut. Light Weight can launch himself into the air despite his girth.  Lightning Hands' speed makes him an excellent goalie.  Hooking Leg can propel soccer balls at high speeds with an acrobatic twist of his torso. Iron Head makes a great header.  And of course Steel Leg is capable of smashing soccer balls with such force that he threatens airplanes.  It's what the Justice League might look like playing soccer.With such superpowers at their disposal the team proves unstoppable.  Buoyed by their success, it's not long before they (and the movie) acquire endorsements from Puma and face down Hung's Team Evil on the field. Team Evil is just as powerful as our Shaolin superheroes, only, you know, evil.  They have an evil counterpart for each of them, and worse, multiple copies: the jumping guy, the hard-headed guy, the powerful kicker, etc.Meanwhile Iron Leg's friendship with Mui (Vicki Zhao), a pimply-faced insecure girl who uses tai chi to make mantou, becomes strained when her overtures at romance are rejected. Dejected, she disappears, only to reappear at the eleventh hour when Team Evil brings out the big guns.Despite its goofy sensibilities, it's hard not to love this film.  ""Shaolin Soccer"" humorously embraces the usual chopsocky tropes and then exaggerates them even further with a dose of CGI.

White ""impossiblefunky""","[28, 33]","One in a long list of films that have been butchered by Miramax in an effort to make Hong Kong films more palatable, SHAOLIN SOCCER suffered doubly due to shifting release dates (it was pushed back for over a year and a half).  In its native country, SHAOLIN SOCCER was one of the most successful films and for good reason.  It takes the typical ""ragtag underdogs teaming up to fight against insurmountable odds"" adding Shaolin kung fu and special effects to the mix for a perfect combination.When the formerly formidable soccer star Golden Leg Fung (Man Tat Ng)--now a limping lackey thanks to his teammate Hung (Patrick Tse)--loses his job, he hopes to start his own soccer team.  He happens upon Sing (Stephen Chow), a cleaner who has been charged by his former master with spreading the techniques of Shaolin kung fu.  Sing has been searching for a way to repackage Shaolin in a new, exciting, and socially viable form.  It takes a bit but Sing finally realizes that his ""Iron Leg"" technique would be a perfect fit in Golden Leg's dream soccer team.Golden Leg and Iron Leg set out to convince Sing's five other brothers to join in their venture.  They discover that Iron Head (Yut Fei Wong), Empty Hand (Kwok Kuen Chan), Weight Vest (Lam Chi Chung), Hooking Leg (Chi-Sing Lam), and Iron Shirt (Kai Man Tin) have let their confidence and skills lapse.  Can they regain the spirit from their idealistic days of youth?  You better believe it!  After some hilarious training sequences, the brothers come together as a team and begin to make their way through the ranks of the soccer championships until their showdown with Hung's appropriately named ""Evil Team.""Along the way, Sing meets Mui (Vicki Zhao), a master of Tai Chi and bread making.  When the two meet, Sing's infectious optimism and singing create chaos in the streets and results in a dance sequence highly inspired by Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"" video.  This moment is typical of the uproarious tone of Chow's film.  As much as it took from other ""losers banding together"" films like THE BAD NEWS BEARS, REVENGE OF THE NERDS, and THE REPLACEMENTS, Chow's film helped pave the way for other Asian ""extreme sport"" films such as Fumihiko Sori's PING PONG and Yudai Yamaguchi's BATTLEFIELD BASEBALL.A word of warning: in all, nearly twenty-two minutes of the film were eliminated for the long-delayed, limited US release.

689562,A3Q83VI243WI7U,B00005Y7GQ,Michael Topper,"[14, 14]","Stephen Chow has proven himself to be one of the world's finest directors with ""Shaolin Soccer"" (aka ""Kung-Fu Soccer""), which was Hong Kong's biggest-ever box-office success when released in 2001.  The simple story of a family of brothers who use Shaolin kung-fu to win the national China soccer tournament against The Evil Team (who use ""American medicines"" to win their games) isbolstered by some hilarious comedy, spirited performances andvery creative special effects.  Outside of the comedic scenes--which are among the funniest I've seen in a foreign film in a long time--the film's mystical element comes through most uniquely, as during the fabled hypnotic scene involving Mui's steamed bread making.  The part where the brothers are getting beaten to death on the field and then suddenly ""freeze"" revert to ancient kung-fu forms was also startling and wonderful.Although banned in mainland China because it was released in Hong Kong before given official certification, this film also works as a glimpse into what the modern-day country looked like in 2001.  ""Shaolin Soccer"" was primarily filmed not in Hong Kong but in Shanghai, and uses that city's futuristic-looking new skyscrapers and hip, youthful citizens as a slick, glittery backdrop to its story. Never before has communist China looked this modern, confident and vibrant in a movie.  The special effects, too, are very cutting-edge, and work particularly well during the final soccer match where flying soccer balls become ferocious black tigers, and some kicks are so powerful as to rip the skin right off of the players.  At no point is this movie ever dull or uninteresting, and most of the time it moves at a roaring pace.  The director's cut on the foreign DVD is even better, as it features two lengthy scenes that were cut out of the original, but add to the subplot between Sing and Mui.Whether you are a fan of martial arts, comedy, China, or justplain good old fashioned filmmaking, this film is for you, and when it is released here in the US this August I hope it becomesa phenomenon.  Very highly recommended--I have seen it three times now and it continues to grow on me.",5,"Brilliant blend of martial arts, comedy, SFX, mysticism",1051228800,"04 25, 2003",2003,2156,"['Stephen', 'Chow', 'proven', 'be', 'one', 'world', 'finest', 'directors', 'Shaolin', 'Soccer', 'Kung-Fu', 'Soccer', 'was', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'biggest-ever', 'box-office', 'success', 'when', 'released', '2001', 'simple', 'story', 'family', 'brothers', 'who', 'use', 'Shaolin', 'kung-fu', 'win', 'national', 'China', 'soccer', 'tournament', 'Evil', 'Team', 'who', 'use', 'American', 'medicines', 'win', 'games', 'isbolstered', 'hilarious', 'comedy', 'spirited', 'performances', 'andvery', 'creative', 'special', 'effects', 'comedic', 'scenes', 'are', 'funniest', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'foreign', 'film', 'long', 'time', 'film', 'mystical', 'element', 'most', 'uniquely', 'fabled', 'hypnotic', 'scene', 'involving', 'Mui', 'steamed', 'bread', 'making', 'part', 'where', 'brothers', 'are', 'getting', 'beaten', 'death', 'field', 'then', 'suddenly', 'freeze', 'revert', 'ancient', 'kung-fu', 'forms', 'was', 'also', 'startling', 'wonderful.Although', 'banned', 'mainland', 'China', 'was', 'released', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'given', 'official', 'certification', 'film', 'also', 'glimpse', 'what', 'modern-day', 'country', 'looked', '2001', 'Shaolin', 'Soccer', 'was', 'primarily', 'filmed', 'not', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'Shanghai', 'city', 'futuristic-looking', 'new', 'skyscrapers', 'hip', 'youthful', 'citizens', 'slick', 'glittery', 'backdrop', 'story', 'Never', 'communist', 'China', 'looked', 'modern', 'confident', 'vibrant', 'movie', 'special', 'effects', 'too', 'are', 'very', 'cutting-edge', 'work', 'particularly', 'well', 'final', 'soccer', 'match', 'where', 'flying', 'soccer', 'balls', 'become', 'ferocious', 'black', 'tigers', 'kicks', 'are', 'so', 'powerful', 'rip', 'skin', 'right', 'players', 'point', 'movie', 'ever', 'uninteresting', 'most', 'time', 'roaring', 'pace', 'director', 'cut', 'foreign', 'DVD', 'even', 'better', 'two', 'lengthy', 'scenes', 'were', 'cut', 'original', 'add', 'subplot', 'Sing', 'Mui.Whether', 'are', 'fan', 'martial', 'arts', 'comedy', 'China', 'justplain', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'filmmaking', 'film', 'when', 'released', 'here', 'US', 'August', 'hope', 'becomesa', 'phenomenon', 'Very', 'highly', 'recommended', 'have', 'seen', 'three', 'times', 'now', 'grow']",Shaolin Soccer

It involves six masters of kung fu that have broken apart from each other and are working dead end jobs. The Walter Mathau type role of the broken down has been turned coach, goes to a washed up soccer star from twenty years ago that agreed to throw a championship game, and then had his leg permanently injued by an angry mob of fans. One of the masters, who has nicknamed himself Steel Leg, showcases what he can do, and convinces the coach to agree to form a team with him. Steel Leg then goes to his other five ""brothers"" as he calls them, and convinces them to quit their jobs and form a team. The masters go from knowing nothing about soccer, to becoming masters of it by using their knowledge of kung fu towards the game.Shaolin Soccer is probably one of the best movies I have seen in the last couple of years. It involves a very nice mix of comedy, great special effects, and action sequences. I am not a big fan of soccer at all, but I must say that it came off quite well in this movie. It was very entertaining and interesting to see kung fu mixed together with it. Perhaps the film's best feature is the unbelieveable special effects that were used. Although some of the sequences used are over the top, the special effects are so good, that the sequences come off looking realistic.Unfortunately Shaolin Soccer had a limited release in theaters. However, I highly recommend it. The DVD includes both the original Chinese version of the film with all the footage included, and the version that was released in U.S. theaters. Although I prefer watching the original version with subtitles, it is nice to be able to watch the theatrical version with the english language track when you don't feel like reading The extras for the DVD are somewhat limited.

It's full of silly comedy, but it also has a very nice story about a team of losers seeking to become something more.  Yes, that's nearly every sports movie that's ever been made, but what seperates Shaolin Soccer is its visual flair.The movie takes those old Wu Shu cliches and puts them on the soccer field.  More importantly, it does so without insulting the kung fu genre.  This is a silly movie, but it's also full of geniune characters and enjoyable action.  Never has soccer been more ridiculous or awe-inspiring.I hate to compare movies, but I'd have to say that though this film and Kung Fu Hustle share a lot in common, they are also very different.  Shaolin Soccer is more realistic, set mostly in the real world, with super martial arts as its only strong fantasty element.  It's a quieter film, but by no means did I find it boring.

689570,A2PLWJVM15L9T8,B00005Y7GQ,"M. Sutton ""Montgomery Sutton""","[0, 0]","Shaolin Soccer is really a terrific piece of cinematic fun. It's at times hilarous, at times marvelous (while some special effects are obvious, some are seemless, and all of the martial-arts-style-soccer sequences in the film are breathtaking). It's a very comic-book style story of a group of Shaolin monks who have had to abandon the order to make a living. Steven Chow (the star, writer, and director of this Hong Kong Academy Award winning film) brings them together when he discovers that Shaolin can be used to play soccer! Together the reunited brothers take on team after team, under their former-soccer-star-turned-gimp coach played by Ng Man Tat, eventually challenging Team Evil, run by an evil beurocratic former soccer player who has a long history with the Shaolin team's coach. The road they travel, though, is filled with gag after gag and frequent displays of impressive Martial Arts action. There is an interesting quasi-romance story on the side featuring Chow and the beautiful Vicki Zhao (who is made up in the film to have growths all over her face) that was almost entirely cut out in the American theatrical run, but it's a very interesting story that provides a great character ark for Zhao.When, as I mentioned before, Miramax presented Shaolin Soccer for theatrical release, it was in the form of a sliced-and-diced (re-edited hack job) that really undermined the intellegence behind the slapstick in Shaolin Soccer. Character development was reduced to nill and relationships lost meaning. Signs were translated into English through poor utiliazation of CGI. Still, it was great to see parts of the film on the big screen.For DVD, though, Miramax provides both it's U.S. Theatrical version and the infinitely superior Original Chinese version (actually the extended version) on one reasonably priced DVD. The DVD, though containing 0 special features, is beautiful! I didn't bother watching the U.S. version (and neither will you, if you have any sense about you) but the 112 minute chinese version of the film is presented in a beatiful, almost faultless transfer. Sharpness is great, contrast is right on, grain is reduced, color balance is as good as one could hope for. It's a BIG improvement, visually, over the HK Universe DVD released a few years ago.While the film might not fit everyone's taste, it's worth checking out for anyone. At least give it a rental and check out the original Chinese version, but I encourage you to take my advice and buy it now, as 90% of you will fall in love with the film once you see it. If you saw the film in theaters, regardless of whether you liked it then check out this disc!

This guy loves sholin so much, he falls for a not-so attractive employee for a steam bun store(Vicki Zhao Wei, who in reality isn't ugly(dang makeup) but very very cute).

It's that simple.I finally purchased the DVD today and I have to say that I'm slightly disappointed and only because this DVD is lacking in the features department. There isn't much here besides both cuts of the film (the US and the original Chinese, the latter of the two being the one to watch), so you're covered if you can't stand the dubbed version or if you're not into the sometimes strange Chinese humor. But that's really it. No special features to speak of.The picture quality is fine but I have to make special mention of the sound. This has one of the most active 5.1 mixes and if you want a film that really puts your surround system to the test, look no further.In a nutshell, if you want a technically great presentation of the film and not much else, go with this.

I think my teenaged son laughed harder than I did.  This is like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon Meets the Mighty Ducks.  A former soccer great called Golden Leg Funghad his career ruined after a gangster caused him to break his legendary leg.  years later, Fung meets a Kung Fu Master named Sing whose steel leg can do wonders on a soccer ball.  Sing is a Bruce Lee look-alike and even wears the yellow jump suit that Lee wore in Game of Death.  Fung reunites Sing with his former Shaolin brothers and puts their remarkable Kung Fu skills to work on the soccer field.  The brothers all have names which are clues to their Kung Fu Skills such as Iron Head, Lighting Hands, Iron Shirt Tin, and hooking leg.Together they form one outrageous teams complimented by Matrix like special effects as  balls are kicked and scream like rockets, trailing fire and tearing up the field as they fly towards the opponents goal.  Or Hooking Leg demonstrates the most incredible degree of hook ever seen as his kicks turn 90 degrees.  Fung sets them up for a run in a bis soccer tournament and a show down with the team of the mob leader who caused his injury years earlier.  His team is called the dastardly ""Team Evil"" just in case their black uniforms and scowls didn't tip you off.The formula works like any of those American films such as Mighty Ducks, Bad News Bears or the like.  Shaolin Soccer is like watching a live action cartoon with the wild, slap-stick action and special effects.  The cast is hilarious with brilliant one-liners and facial expressions.

689590,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005Y7GQ,Tsuyoshi,"[9, 9]","In the summer of 2001, this hilarious comedy-action film was released in Hong Kong, and it immediately became the biggest hit there, even beating the previous box-office record of Jackie Chan's ""First Strike.""  The craze went on, and when it was released in Japan in May, 2002, it again became an instant smash hit even though Stephen Chow's name, before that release, had been known only among the small number of devoted Hong Kong film fans.  How the movie is received in US and other regions, I don't know, but as those facts testify, ""Kung-Fu Soccer"" is an incredibly funny movie.[STORY}] You need one?  OK, it is about a young man Sing (Chow) who wants to promote the usefulness of kung-fu he learned at Shaolin Temple, and an ex-star soccer player ""Golden Leg"" Fung (good supporting actor Ng Man Tat), who is now down and out, living in misery.  However, when Fung meets Sing on the street of Hong Kong, and sees how he kicks an empty can miles away (literally), Fung realises that here is a golden opportunity for him to regain the dignity and pride he lost long time ago.  Combination of Kung-fu and soccer!  Invincible!!So, Sing recruits the old pupils he knew when he was training at the temple to make a soccer team.  They are no longer what they were; one is a businessman busy with a cell ohone, another totally unemployed, and so on....  And they seem to have lost the skills they had once until, of course, one day, suddenly, they come back in good shape, ready for fight, game for more.  Meanwhile, Sing meets a girl named Mui (Vicki Zhao), and a romance (but very unusual one) starts to bloom.  My overall impression is, in short, Austin Powers with sports and martial arts.[WHO IS STEPHEN CHOW?]  Chow has been very popular in Hong Kong since the year 1990, about two years he made his film debut, and he is 40 years old at the time of writing this, but looks much younger and very agile.  His comedies are always filled with incredibly stupid and ridiculous things, often under the very unique situations.  Some of his movies include ""With Love from Beijin"" (1994) ""The God of Cookery"" (1996), and many others, and I hope those titles would tell you what you see in those funny films.  Always stupid and powerful, often with extraordinary  parodies, his films give you dynamic gags with improvised atomosphere.  Though the film often lacks a coherent story, and his character is not always amiable, finally you come to like him.[ABOUT THIS FILM] As I said, ""Kung-Fu Soccer"" is a funny comedy, and it also uses first-rate wire-actions and CG images to create its original world.  The soccer players jump (to the height of more than 10 meters), kick a ball (to make a hole in a concrete wall, or sometimes catches fire, becoming a roaring puma-like shape!), and ... well, about the rest you should see for yourself.  Some of the CGIs are intentionally (and aptly) cheesy (see how villains fly in a browl), but some are surprisingly effective, especailly in the final game scene.  Not ""Titanic"" class, but its use is well-regulated and most importantly, makes lots of funny scenes.[AND ... TRIVIA]  1) As Stephen Chow is a great fan of Bruce Lee, he makes a reference to this legendary hero in the character of the goal keeper whose orange-colored uniform is that of Lee in his last film ""Game of Death.""  2) Vicki Chao is a famous, very popular idol singer/actress in mainland China, but she never shows her real face.  Three time she appears, but each time she is wearing some make-ups.  This is an in-joke for those who know her, but to some audience Chow's joke may seem to have gone too far.  3) If you're a Hong-Kong film fan, check out the special appearances of Karen Mok with a strange make-up (regular of Chow's films like ""The God of Cookery"" and also seen in Jet Li's  ""Black Mask"") and Vincent Kok (also seen in ""With Love"" and director of Jackie Chan's ""Gorgeous"").[AND FINALLY...]  The film has first made with the running time of 102 minutes, and then two additional sequences are made to make it 109 minutes (I saw the latter one in Japan).  However, it has been reported that for the US release Miramax decided to cut extensively the Asian version, so you may keep that in mind.  But, though I hate those changes done to the films, I think, as far as this case goes, the cuts would not affect the total effect of the film very much (I admit some parts of the original version was, to me, a little unnecessary or ineffective) because the film itself is way too funny.  Well, anyway, that's for the record.I love the film.  Hope you enjoy it.",5,Love Sports?
