Bergman films with sensitiveness every section of the orchestra while it's playing Mozart, Mendelssohn, Smetana and Beethoven.

773687,AYCJSA9HR7TKO,B0000C665C,Kerry Walters,"[1, 1]","""To Joy,"" released in 1950, isn't a very good film, although it does have its moments.  It was Bergman's eighth film, and he was still learning his trade as both a director and a writer.  But there are indications of the impending explosion of his genius in 1953 with Summer with ""Summer with Monika"" and ""Sawdust and Tinsel.""The film reminds one of Peter Shaffer's ""Amadeus"" in its treatment of the difficulty of living with artistic mediocrity.  Stip is a violinist in a small orchestra who aspires to be a famous soloist.  But he just doesn't have what it takes--his one and only solo performance ends disastrously--and his frustration, rage, and self-loathing nearly destroy him and alienates everyone who loves him.  His long-suffering wife Marta doesn't crave fame.  All she wants, she tells Stig, is honesty in life.  The main thing is ""to become a real person.""  Stig is disdainful of this ""small"" purpose, but at last comes to his senses after nearly losing Marta and their two children.  He learns, as Salieri in Shaffer's ""Amadeus"" never did, that small joys and little meanings are rewarding and, ultimately the best we can hope for.  The end of the film ends with Marta's accidental death--yet another failure--but one that Stig, having learned to accept the small joys one has instead of lamenting what can't be, responds to it differently than he did to the death of his professional hopes.Maj-Britt Nilsson puts in a good performance as Marta, and Victor Sjostrom, who will just a few years later star in ""Wild Strawberries,"" plays well as Sonderby, the orchestra conductor.  But Stig Eriksson's performance of Stig is uneven.  Erland Josephson has a small speaking role as a drunk at a party, and observant viewers will spot Ingmar Bergman in one scene as a man in a maternity ward waiting room.",3,Bergman as apprentice,1220313600,"09 2, 2008",2008,1812,"['Joy', 'released', '1950', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'film', 'have', 'moments', 'was', 'Bergman', 'eighth', 'film', 'was', 'still', 'learning', 'trade', 'director', 'writer', 'are', 'indications', 'impending', 'explosion', 'genius', '1953', 'Summer', 'Summer', 'Monika', 'Sawdust', 'Tinsel', 'film', 'one', 'Peter', 'Shaffer', 'Amadeus', 'treatment', 'difficulty', 'living', 'artistic', 'mediocrity', 'Stip', 'violinist', 'small', 'orchestra', 'who', 'be', 'famous', 'soloist', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'what', 'one', 'only', 'solo', 'performance', 'disastrously', 'frustration', 'rage', 'self-loathing', 'nearly', 'destroy', 'everyone', 'who', 'long-suffering', 'wife', 'Marta', ""n't"", 'crave', 'fame', 'Stig', 'honesty', 'life', 'main', 'thing', 'become', 'real', 'person', 'Stig', 'disdainful', 'small', 'purpose', 'last', 'senses', 'nearly', 'losing', 'Marta', 'two', 'children', 'Salieri', 'Shaffer', 'Amadeus', 'never', 'did', 'small', 'joys', 'little', 'meanings', 'are', 'rewarding', 'ultimately', 'best', 'can', 'hope', 'end', 'film', 'Marta', 'accidental', 'death', 'yet', 'failure', 'one', 'Stig', 'having', 'learned', 'accept', 'small', 'joys', 'one', 'instead', 'lamenting', 'what', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'differently', 'did', 'death', 'professional', 'hopes.Maj-Britt', 'Nilsson', 'good', 'performance', 'Marta', 'Victor', 'Sjostrom', 'who', 'will', 'just', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'star', 'Wild', 'Strawberries', 'well', 'Sonderby', 'orchestra', 'conductor', 'Stig', 'Eriksson', 'performance', 'Stig', 'uneven', 'Erland', 'Josephson', 'small', 'speaking', 'role', 'drunk', 'party', 'observant', 'viewers', 'will', 'spot', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'one', 'scene', 'man', 'maternity', 'ward', 'waiting', 'room']",N/A

773691,A1VHGHK5NN7NGN,B0000C665C,Raymond Louis Llompart,"[0, 0]","My discovery of the rather ""obscure"" (I believe, except in Sweden where he is probably a ""household word"") STIG OLIN last night just about left me HAUNTED....A fascinating ""man-of-a-thousand-faces"", Olin appears in this film as an ageless man who photographs exquisitely and one moment he is 20------and then he is, what?----50, perhaps (he was 29, actually.) The character is that of a MAGNIFICENTLY NEUROTIC man who wants to ""believe"" but is too bright to accept life in all its hypocrisy and masquerades. What I saw (and you must see perhaps three or four times to, especially, grasp the beauty of the philosophy he ""precariously"" seems to espouse in some long takes)is a man trying to hold on to life, yet always about to descend into chaos. He is morbidly complex------ cruel, foolish, a liar at times, unforgettably tender, intellectually a ""talking"" book (and this is where the film almost falls precariously into melodrama) offering us all these amazingly profound ""soliloquies""------yes, he has much of HAMLET in him......A ""poor man's Hamlet"" indeed. He can be beautifully joyous, a little lost child for all of us to protect, a lost soul barely able to function------but also, a horribly self-absorbed person who you never come to actually trust on  whether he CARES for anyone but himself.A violinist, he suffers a terrible episode when, because of the promise he shows is given a principal role in a major work, by the director of the orchestra (the same old man from ""Wild Strawberries"", a few years before---1949) and makes a mess of it. The possibility of a soloist career appears over, and the pain is overwhelming. He marries, has twins, poverty is ever-present throughout, and his wife, played quite beautifully by an actress new to me as well, Maj-Britt Nilsson, suffers quietly while he takes on a vixen lover/whore (a total surprise that comes unexpectedly) and in a confrontation even ends up striking the wife again and again, the poor woman unable to reconcile her love for him and the family they have ""built"" with what she always ""knew"" would materialize. They go back and forth as the children grow, she spending long periods away from him.There are quite a bit of rough edges in ""To Joy"", a certain.......amateurish quality to the film-------indeed, a glaring one being that the movie opens in the ""present"" (another tragedy befalling our ""hero"") and then the whole film takes place in the past, but Bergman unfortunately does not go back to the ""present"" and puts it all aside, apparently because he could not find enough of a reason to take us back (I see no other answer, but this is Bergman) leaving more than a certain taste of Sentimentality in the ending-------although beautiful in itself.This actor played, I believe, in several other early Bergman films, and I look forward to every one of his performances.Arguably a ""lesser"" Bergman, and yet even his less than excellent material shines brightly (in this case) because of what turns out to be an unforgettable character study.......Mr. OLIN chews up the screen and leaves no space for just about anything, anyone else.",4,"A touch of ""Soap Opera"", yet much PROFOUND.........",1383264000,"11 1, 2013",2013,3109,"['discovery', 'rather', 'obscure', 'believe', 'Sweden', 'where', 'probably', 'household', 'word', 'STIG', 'OLIN', 'last', 'night', 'just', 'left', 'HAUNTED', 'fascinating', 'man-of-a-thousand-faces', 'Olin', 'film', 'ageless', 'man', 'who', 'exquisitely', 'one', 'moment', '20', 'then', 'what', '50', 'perhaps', 'was', '29', 'actually', 'character', 'MAGNIFICENTLY', 'NEUROTIC', 'man', 'who', 'believe', 'too', 'bright', 'accept', 'life', 'hypocrisy', 'masquerades', 'What', 'saw', 'must', 'see', 'perhaps', 'three', 'four', 'times', 'especially', 'grasp', 'beauty', 'philosophy', 'precariously', 'espouse', 'long', 'man', 'trying', 'hold', 'life', 'yet', 'always', 'descend', 'chaos', 'morbidly', 'complex', 'cruel', 'foolish', 'liar', 'times', 'unforgettably', 'tender', 'intellectually', 'talking', 'book', 'where', 'film', 'almost', 'precariously', 'melodrama', 'offering', 'amazingly', 'profound', 'soliloquies', 'yes', 'much', 'HAMLET', 'poor', 'man', 'Hamlet', 'indeed', 'can', 'be', 'beautifully', 'joyous', 'little', 'lost', 'child', 'protect', 'lost', 'soul', 'barely', 'able', 'function', 'also', 'horribly', 'self-absorbed', 'person', 'who', 'never', 'come', 'actually', 'trust', 'CARES', 'anyone', 'himself.A', 'violinist', 'terrible', 'episode', 'when', 'promise', 'given', 'principal', 'role', 'major', 'work', 'director', 'orchestra', 'same', 'old', 'man', 'Wild', 'Strawberries', 'few', 'years', 'before', '-1949', 'mess', 'possibility', 'soloist', 'career', 'pain', 'overwhelming', 'twins', 'poverty', 'ever-present', 'wife', 'played', 'quite', 'beautifully', 'actress', 'new', 'well', 'Maj-Britt', 'Nilsson', 'suffers', 'quietly', 'vixen', 'lover/whore', 'total', 'surprise', 'unexpectedly', 'confrontation', 'even', 'up', 'striking', 'wife', 'again', 'again', 'poor', 'woman', 'unable', 'reconcile', 'love', 'family', 'have', 'built', 'what', 'always', 'knew', 'would', 'materialize', 'go', 'back', 'forth', 'children', 'grow', 'spending', 'long', 'periods', 'away', 'are', 'quite', 'bit', 'rough', 'edges', 'Joy', 'certain', '.amateurish', 'quality', 'film', '-indeed', 'glaring', 'one', 'being', 'movie', 'present', 'tragedy', 'befalling', 'hero', 'then', 'whole', 'film', 'place', 'past', 'Bergman', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'go', 'back', 'present', 'aside', 'apparently', 'could', 'not', 'find', 'enough', 'reason', 'take', 'back', 'see', 'other', 'answer', 'Bergman', 'leaving', 'more', 'certain', 'taste', 'Sentimentality', 'ending', '-although', 'beautiful', 'itself.This', 'actor', 'played', 'believe', 'several', 'other', 'early', 'Bergman', 'films', 'look', 'forward', 'one', 'performances.Arguably', 'lesser', 'Bergman', 'yet', 'even', 'less', 'excellent', 'material', 'shines', 'brightly', 'case', 'what', 'out', 'be', 'unforgettable', 'character', 'study', '.Mr.', 'OLIN', 'up', 'screen', 'space', 'just', 'anything', 'anyone', 'else']",N/A
