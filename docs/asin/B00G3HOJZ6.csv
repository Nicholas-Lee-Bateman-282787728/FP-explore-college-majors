The only negative I have and it's not about the movie but with the english sub-titles. The words blended into the scene of the film and to me was hard to read at times.

1676429,A1M2UIO0DNLH1S,B00G3HOJZ6,L. Nguyen,"[6, 6]","I have to admit what got me to watch this movie was the director's name. I grew up watching the golden age of movies in the 90s and Tsui Hark is just one of those directors in which I'm probably going to watch his movies regardless. His recent ones( Seven Swords, The Flying Swords of Dragon Gate) have been entertaining and so I expected this movie to be no less. I was not disappointed.  Young Detective Dee is a prequel to Detective Dee and the Mystery of the Phantom Flame- but you really don't have to watch that one first. It connected but kinda isn't really so it's fine as a stand alone.Mark Chao plays the brilliant Detective Dee in his earlier years before he becomes the polished, methodic version of himself  in the first film. I was actually hesitant to watch this film at first because I was not familiar at all with Mark Chao's acting..and looking on Wikipedia... I haven't seen very many of his movies as he is still fairly new. He was decent as the main character and I really had to remind myself not to compare his interpretation with Andy Lau's because their acting styles are different. Mark Chao's portrayal of Detective Dee might have been what he would have been in his youth, but sometimes I found that he seemed kind of lost. I'm not sure if that was what he intended to portray- but at times, he seems very impassive and comes off as a bit of a mouth breather instead of being the brilliant Dee but it's far and few in between and most likely intending to show how Detective Dee wasn't always the master of mysteries and had his moments growing up...but I digress. All in all Mark Chao gave a solid performance as Dee. I did not find him lacking really in the character. Carina Lau makes another appearance in here reprising her role as the Empress. She's not in here as much but she always was a very respected actress that I haven't seen in awhile so it was good to see her again. I swear, she doesn't age a bit. Feng Shaofeng plays Detective Yuchi- a very interesting character. I have seen this actor in some of the other movies that he has been in and he was very good in this role. He did a great job of portraying just the right balance of defensiveness/helpfulness that defines his character and his interactions with Dee were amusing. Lin Gengxin is Dee's sidekick in this movie and he pretty much is exactly what you would think his character would be like next to Detective Dee. He is good for some light amusement and basically being Robin to Batman. This actor I had seen in more of his TV series and not really any of his movies. He has a face which I kept thinking was familiar and wasn't until I googled him did I make the connection. He's good as one of the group. Kim Bum plays Yuan Zhen another character in the subplot and he's good in the few scenes that he was in. Angelababy is Yin Ruiji, the capital's most beautiful courtesan. She is good as another character in the mystery but her character didn't have much depth to her. All in all, this was a pretty solid cast.The mystery  really is about a huge sea monster that comes out at night and attacks the area. The palace orders Dective Yushi to get on it and solve the mystery. At the same time, Detective Dee arrives in the Imperial Capital to become an officer of the law. He clashes with Detective Yushi and gets himself into all sorts of trouble. The biggest mystery is really the Sea Dragon.  You also have a couple of other minor mysteries that of course, Detective Dee and company all solve and wrap up everything neatly at the end.  To be honest, the premise of the mystery, the reasoning behind it and the execution of the plans to completion is a tad bit ludicrous. If you are looking for a mystery that will leave you wracking your mind to find out the solution then this movie isn't really for you.  The problem with the Detective Dee movies is that it's not really about deep plot stories, etc., etc., It's more of this is the mystery, here is the reason why these events are occurring and this is the solution. Oh and yeah, some of these details are weak and hardly plausible at times but, whatever.  If this movie didn't have Mark Chao pulling off the delivery of the brilliant Detective Dee and making otherwise lame details seem credible and if Tsui Hark hadn't done such a great job of effects and seamlessly weaving the direction of the movie, I would have said that this movie was ridiculous. You have to take this movie as it is. It's not a super complicated plot. It's silly at times, but it works. The finished product is a light, amusing and fun piece of work. This movie is typical Tsui Hark as of now- great 3d, slow mo effects at certain times, good choreography,  brilliant colors, and yes, people flying around fighting. Personally, I think all of those things add up to a very enjoyable two hours.",4,Amusing Light Fun,1393286400,"02 25, 2014",2014,4828,"['have', 'admit', 'what', 'got', 'watch', 'movie', 'was', 'director', 'name', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'golden', 'age', 'movies', '90s', 'Tsui', 'Hark', 'just', 'one', 'directors', ""'m"", 'probably', 'going', 'watch', 'movies', 'regardless', 'recent', 'ones', 'Seven', 'Swords', 'Flying', 'Swords', 'Dragon', 'Gate', 'have', 'been', 'entertaining', 'so', 'expected', 'movie', 'be', 'less', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'Young', 'Detective', 'Dee', 'prequel', 'Detective', 'Dee', 'Mystery', 'Phantom', 'Flame-', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'watch', 'one', 'first', 'connected', 'kinda', ""n't"", 'really', 'so', 'fine', 'stand', 'alone.Mark', 'Chao', 'brilliant', 'Detective', 'Dee', 'earlier', 'years', 'polished', 'methodic', 'version', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'actually', 'hesitant', 'watch', 'film', 'first', 'was', 'not', 'familiar', 'Mark', 'Chao', 'acting..and', 'looking', 'Wikipedia', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'very', 'many', 'movies', 'still', 'fairly', 'new', 'was', 'decent', 'main', 'character', 'really', 'had', 'remind', 'not', 'compare', 'interpretation', 'Andy', 'Lau', 'acting', 'styles', 'are', 'different', 'Mark', 'Chao', 'portrayal', 'Detective', 'Dee', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'youth', 'sometimes', 'found', 'seemed', 'kind', 'lost', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'what', 'intended', 'portray-', 'times', 'very', 'impassive', 'off', 'bit', 'mouth', 'breather', 'instead', 'being', 'brilliant', 'Dee', 'far', 'few', 'most', 'likely', 'intending', 'show', 'how', 'Detective', 'Dee', 'was', ""n't"", 'always', 'master', 'mysteries', 'had', 'moments', 'growing', 'up', 'digress', 'Mark', 'Chao', 'gave', 'solid', 'performance', 'Dee', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'lacking', 'really', 'character', 'Carina', 'Lau', 'appearance', 'here', 'reprising', 'role', 'Empress', 'not', 'here', 'much', 'always', 'was', 'very', 'respected', 'actress', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'awhile', 'was', 'good', 'see', 'again', 'swear', ""n't"", 'age', 'bit', 'Feng', 'Shaofeng', 'Detective', 'Yuchi-', 'very', 'interesting', 'character', 'have', 'seen', 'actor', 'other', 'movies', 'been', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'role', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'portraying', 'just', 'right', 'balance', 'defensiveness/helpfulness', 'character', 'interactions', 'Dee', 'were', 'amusing', 'Lin', 'Gengxin', 'Dee', 'sidekick', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'exactly', 'what', 'would', 'think', 'character', 'would', 'be', 'next', 'Detective', 'Dee', 'good', 'light', 'amusement', 'basically', 'being', 'Robin', 'Batman', 'actor', 'had', 'seen', 'more', 'TV', 'series', 'not', 'really', 'movies', 'face', 'kept', 'thinking', 'was', 'familiar', 'was', ""n't"", 'googled', 'did', 'make', 'connection', 'good', 'one', 'group', 'Kim', 'Bum', 'Yuan', 'Zhen', 'character', 'subplot', 'good', 'few', 'scenes', 'was', 'Angelababy', 'Yin', 'Ruiji', 'capital', 'most', 'beautiful', 'courtesan', 'good', 'character', 'mystery', 'character', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'depth', 'was', 'pretty', 'solid', 'cast.The', 'mystery', 'really', 'huge', 'sea', 'monster', 'out', 'night', 'area', 'palace', 'orders', 'Dective', 'Yushi', 'get', 'solve', 'mystery', 'same', 'time', 'Detective', 'Dee', 'Imperial', 'Capital', 'become', 'officer', 'law', 'Detective', 'Yushi', 'sorts', 'trouble', 'biggest', 'mystery', 'really', 'Sea', 'Dragon', 'also', 'have', 'couple', 'other', 'minor', 'mysteries', 'course', 'Detective', 'Dee', 'company', 'solve', 'wrap', 'up', 'everything', 'neatly', 'end', 'be', 'honest', 'premise', 'mystery', 'reasoning', 'execution', 'plans', 'completion', 'tad', 'bit', 'ludicrous', 'are', 'looking', 'mystery', 'will', 'leave', 'wracking', 'mind', 'find', 'out', 'solution', 'then', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'problem', 'Detective', 'Dee', 'movies', 'not', 'really', 'deep', 'plot', 'stories', 'etc.', 'etc.', 'more', 'mystery', 'here', 'reason', 'why', 'events', 'are', 'occurring', 'solution', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'details', 'are', 'weak', 'hardly', 'plausible', 'times', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'Mark', 'Chao', 'pulling', 'off', 'delivery', 'brilliant', 'Detective', 'Dee', 'making', 'otherwise', 'lame', 'details', 'seem', 'credible', 'Tsui', 'Hark', 'had', ""n't"", 'done', 'great', 'job', 'effects', 'seamlessly', 'weaving', 'direction', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'said', 'movie', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'have', 'take', 'movie', 'not', 'super', 'complicated', 'plot', 'silly', 'times', 'finished', 'product', 'light', 'amusing', 'fun', 'piece', 'work', 'movie', 'typical', 'Tsui', 'Hark', 'now-', 'great', '3d', 'slow', 'mo', 'effects', 'certain', 'times', 'good', 'choreography', 'brilliant', 'colors', 'yes', 'people', 'flying', 'fighting', 'Personally', 'think', 'things', 'add', 'up', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'two', 'hours']",N/A

1676432,AAPT0IT4F8ABH,B00G3HOJZ6,Matthew Scott Baker,"[32, 33]","A couple of years ago, I reviewed an excellent movie titled DETECTIVE DEE: MYSTERY OF THE PHANTOM FLAME.  The review was lost when my blog crashed over a year ago, but my impression of the film still remains; it is an eye-popping masterpiece that dazzles and delights.  Director Hark Tsui is back with a prequel to that film, and although Detective Dee is younger in this one, he does not fail to impress.  Much like it&#8217;s predecessor, YOUNG DETECTIVE DEE: RISE OF THE SEA DRAGON is a fast-paced, action-filled masterpiece that entertains on several levels.Because this is a prequel, the same actor could not portray Detective Dee.  Andy Lau did an excellent job of bringing Dee to life in the first one, and actor Mark Chao continues this tradition with this film.  Both men have unique traits and characteristics that help define the legendary inspector, and both do a great job in this role.YOUNG DETECTIVE DEE: RISE OF THE SEA DRAGON is shot well and looks amazing onscreen.  I don&#8217;t use this phrase much, but this film is literally a visual feast for the eyes.  It uses a lot of CG, which is interwoven with the live-action almost flawlessly.  This, therefore, allows for deeper immersion into the story and thus a more entertaining experience.As with the previous film, the action in this one is intense, and the fight scenes are full of &#8216;wow&#8217;-inducing moves.  The wire-work continues to impress, not to mention the fight choreography itself.  You just basically can&#8217;t ask for better in a martial-arts film.The storyline of YOUNG DETECTIVE DEE: RISE OF THE SEA DRAGON is also impressive.  The narrative never drops off nor does it grow stale; the story moves at a nice pace and there are no dull moments or stalled dialogue.

I wish they offered this film with the English dubbing option because the english sub-titles on this film went by so fast that I couldn't keep up with the story.The sub-titles will go by so fast that you will miss so much of the dialogue.  It'll change twice inside of just a single second, and maybe three times inside of just two seconds.  The wording of the sub-titles can be from 8 to 10 words at a time, and will change again before you can get to the fifth word. This was so annoying that I had to give up on this film about half way though it because, after about an hour of watching, I still didn't quite know where the story was going.Anyway, when I did get a chance to actually watch the scenes where there were no dialogue with subtitles, I found that alot of the action scenes were rather annoying too. It had alot of silly ""fairy-like"" flying around that just didn't reflect common sense motions of true inertia. Most movies that do this, kinda kill the appeal of the whole movie for me anyway.I miss the days when karate scenes and fight scenes weren't enhanced by wires and special effects. No matter how much effort they apply to make it look realistic, it still never does.Well, anyway, I may try to watch this film once more, perhaps with my pause button at the ready to catch a fast changing sub-title passage. But the appeal has already waned on me because of the silly ""Wuxia"" styled acrobatics.With the near 10 minute closing credits, I caught the name of the guy who put in the sub-titles. His name is Tony Rayns.  Perhaps he should reconsider another career, or at least consider asking if he could re-do his work here and re-issue this movie again.  Well, we know that isn't going to happen.  Maybe, next time, they will preview this film with his sub-title work, and ask for a re-do if it is necessary, before they mass produce it, as this film should have been done.",3,I'm sure it's a good story.

Most movies look better at the movie theater if one wants to take that view, but how many of us own a movie theater? We must do with what he have and for me that is a ""2-D"" TV in my living room.There is suspense and mystery here as Dee finds his way as a new member of the local justice department, he is aided by a somewhat humorous sidekick (medical assistant) who he meets in the infirmary and convinces to go along with him. There is a beautiful lady in distress of course, played by ""Angelababy."" Then there is the monster, actually two monsters, a man sized one and the sea creature, where did they come from and what will they do?  One of the mysteries in the first part of the film is differentiating between the good guys and the bad guys.
