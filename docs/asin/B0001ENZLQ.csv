In actually its a bit of escapades of scenesfeaturing the bond girls on their work in the bond movies.The thing that bothered me is how one instant some of theactress that are interviewed from halle berry, toMaryam d'abo (whose actually the interviewer), Jill St. Johnall pass themselves of as feminists one minutes, the nexttheir defending themselves from accusations that the bondgirls are just sex objects when in fact they are SEX OBJECTS.Its quite a hilarious contradiction. Some of the womeninterview though like the beautiful Ursula Andress has no problem accepting the fact that she was a sex symbol and was hired for that reason only.In fact actress like Madu Adam who played the love intereest to Roger Moore admits she had objections to the sexual script because it seemed that bond's character took the role of almost an agreesive rapist in a love making scene.So it's an interesting movie with clips thrown in, but its farfrom being an objective documentary.",2,A superficial looking into the James Bond movies,1106179200,"01 20, 2005",2005,1042,"['film', 'listed', 'documentary', 'quite', 'fitthe', 'bill', 'actually', 'bit', 'escapades', 'scenesfeaturing', 'bond', 'girls', 'work', 'bond', 'movies.The', 'thing', 'bothered', 'how', 'one', 'instant', 'theactress', 'are', 'interviewed', 'halle', 'berry', 'toMaryam', ""d'abo"", 'actually', 'interviewer', 'Jill', 'St.', 'Johnall', 'pass', 'feminists', 'one', 'minutes', 'nexttheir', 'defending', 'accusations', 'bondgirls', 'are', 'just', 'sex', 'objects', 'when', 'fact', 'are', 'SEX', 'OBJECTS.Its', 'quite', 'hilarious', 'contradiction', 'womeninterview', 'beautiful', 'Ursula', 'Andress', 'problem', 'accepting', 'fact', 'was', 'sex', 'symbol', 'was', 'hired', 'reason', 'only.In', 'fact', 'Madu', 'Adam', 'who', 'played', 'love', 'intereest', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'had', 'objections', 'sexual', 'script', 'seemed', 'bond', 'character', 'took', 'role', 'almost', 'agreesive', 'rapist', 'love', 'making', 'scene.So', 'interesting', 'movie', 'clips', 'thrown', 'farfrom', 'being', 'objective', 'documentary']",Bond Girls Are Forever

The film shows most of the women who appeared in the James Bond films until 2006. There are very short scenes showing them in the movies and we see them now, somewhat aged. The women tell how people responded to them more because of their appearances with James Bond than any other film or stage work. They also explain, among other things, how the behavior of the Bond women changed.",4,"An introduction to Bond women, then and now",1326844800,"01 18, 2012",2012,518,"['One', 'Bond', 'girls', 'discussion', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'called', 'women', 'produced', 'film', 'starred', 'film', 'most', 'women', 'who', 'appeared', 'James', 'Bond', 'films', '2006', 'are', 'very', 'short', 'scenes', 'showing', 'movies', 'see', 'now', 'somewhat', 'aged', 'women', 'tell', 'how', 'people', 'responded', 'more', 'appearances', 'James', 'Bond', 'other', 'film', 'stage', 'work', 'also', 'explain', 'other', 'things', 'how', 'behavior', 'Bond', 'women', 'changed']",Bond Girls Are Forever

802702,A34PUCLNFN62D3,B0001ENZLQ,Paco Caldern,"[10, 13]","I always thought Bond Girls were Dream Girls, and that Maryam D'Abo was the loveliest of them all! Whether playing vamps, ladies in distress, or a...kicking b...ches, these lasses brought the movie's best fun, for what is the ultimate reason behind any cool car, sharp suit, or newest gadget? Why, THE GIRL, of course!!!Ms D'Abo proves with her documentary (she wrote, produced and directed it) that Bond Girls (""Women""?, ""Sexual Mates""?, ""Female Persons""?, ""Whatever-politically-correct-idiocy-they'll-come-up-next""?) are not merely attractive, but good, intelligent actresses playing the toughest part there is in their craft: the fantasy everyone wishes to get or be. It may sound simple, but it's an Herculean, ehr... Aphrodithean task! How many thespians can convincingly play a drunkard? A cab driver? An honest cop? Quite a lot, to be sure. What good-looking woman can describe herself as the most gorgeous creature that ever walked on Earth? No one in her right mind. Well now ...try playing that!Morons who criticize these brave actresses successfully undertaking this most thankless role, either don't get the joke or carry a burdensome yoke themselves; mainly envy or frustration. And producers who afterwards belittle them as ""bimbos"" are nothing but misogynist cretins; the very sexist pigs feminists should be quarrelling with! As for me, plain moviegoer, I gratefully say long live Bond Girls and the actresses that enlivened them!
