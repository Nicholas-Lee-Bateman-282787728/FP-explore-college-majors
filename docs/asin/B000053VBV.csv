566000,A2GAUG7MPGJQ1B,B000053VBV,"Jeffrey R. Young ""Jeff""","[1, 1]","The character Black Scorpion is born of comic book roots and it certainly shows in this movie. If you were expecting serious crime drama then you're looking in the wrong place. This is definitely not Black Knight Rises, but if your willing to sit back, grab some popcorn and enjoy some fun action including a great looking super hero, a great looking techno-whiz of a car and some fast-paced action you ARE in the right place.One quick warning for parents out there, this movie is rated ""R"" for good reason. Since some of the action is from the mind of Roger Corman it can get a little gruesome and sexy at points in this movie so don't let the comic book roots fool you, this is not for the kiddies.Overall, I was pleasantly surprised that this 17 year old flic stood up as well as it did.

566002,A3GKPMHV4U64IY,B000053VBV,Joshua Koppel,"[5, 6]","When looking for a fun action film, a good choice would be a film  called Black Scorpion that stars Joan Severance.  This movie was followed by a sequel and a television series.Black Scorpion is the story of a young girl raised by a policeman father whose tactics cause him to ruin his career.  Later in life as a cop herself she finds herself in a position where she needs to find justice and the Black Scorpion is born.  Using some clothes from an undercover gig as a prostitute, and a few other additions, a costumed vigilante is created.  Just as she starts to make her mark a super-villain called The Breathtaker threatens the lives of everyone in the city.  It is up to Black Scorpion to save the day.This movie is a well-balanced mix of action, adventure and humor.  The police chief and a con called Argyle (played by Garrett Morris) really help to make this a very enjoyable movie.  At the movie's end the viewer is left wanting to see more Black Scorpion adventures.  Unfortunately, this is the best that the series gets.  This is an R-Rated film for good reason so despite its comic-book feel, this is not one for children.",5,Stinging Good Fun,1082937600,"04 26, 2004",2004,1134,"['When', 'looking', 'fun', 'action', 'film', 'good', 'choice', 'would', 'be', 'film', 'called', 'Black', 'Scorpion', 'Joan', 'Severance', 'movie', 'was', 'followed', 'sequel', 'television', 'series.Black', 'Scorpion', 'story', 'young', 'girl', 'raised', 'policeman', 'father', 'tactics', 'cause', 'ruin', 'career', 'Later', 'life', 'cop', 'position', 'where', 'find', 'justice', 'Black', 'Scorpion', 'born', 'Using', 'clothes', 'undercover', 'gig', 'prostitute', 'few', 'other', 'additions', 'costumed', 'vigilante', 'created', 'Just', 'make', 'mark', 'super-villain', 'called', 'Breathtaker', 'lives', 'everyone', 'city', 'Black', 'Scorpion', 'save', 'day.This', 'movie', 'well-balanced', 'mix', 'action', 'adventure', 'humor', 'police', 'chief', 'con', 'called', 'Argyle', 'played', 'Garrett', 'Morris', 'really', 'help', 'make', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'movie', 'end', 'viewer', 'left', 'wanting', 'see', 'more', 'Black', 'Scorpion', 'Unfortunately', 'best', 'series', 'R-Rated', 'film', 'good', 'reason', 'so', 'comic-book', 'feel', 'not', 'one', 'children']",N/A
