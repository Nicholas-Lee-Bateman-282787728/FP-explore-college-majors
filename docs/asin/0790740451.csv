The man who made her pregnant appears at the drive by window one night, and he and Drew's character get into a fight because Drew wants the guy to be a father for the baby.  Instead, the guy drives off.  It turns out he has a wife of his own and wants nothing to do with the girl he made pregnant.Well, while the guy is driving back to his house, a couple guys in a helicopter decide they want to toy with the guy, and make him scared.  Unfortunately, the helicopter incident makes the guy TOO scared, and the next day the police encounter the guy sitting in the middle of nowhere dead from a heart attack.The storyline from here is that the two guys in the helicopter do everything in their power to make sure they aren't busted for the murder.Unfortunuately for the two helicopter pranksters, they retrace their steps a little TOO much to the point one of the guys actually works at the same fast food restaurant as Drew Barrymore's character.  Eventually the guy falls in love with Drew and well... I guess NOW is a good time to mention Home Fries is mostly definitely a comedy, haha.The biggest problem with Home Fries is that the film is funny in a ""What kind of outrageous plot twist will happen next?"" kind of way.

An unwed mother impregnated by an older man and then abandoned to give birth with no support isn't a comedy.

The back drop of sibling rivalry and overcoming family prejudice is at the core of the story as well, but again, the movie is ridiculous. The son who loves his father's mistreated mistress is an exceptional person who understands suffering.  Watching this movie is like watching a tree get cut down for no good reason; it make you feel bad when something wonderful could have been made but was wrecked without explanation. There is absolutely no shortage of talent, and this film's poor quality has nothing to do with the cast; a cast with talent that is being depreciated.

Everyone in this movie has proved themselves to be good in a number of other projects. They simply are not adapt at the maniacal kind of performing that this movie requires. It's in the same genre as There's Something About Mary, in that a serious subject is not to be taken seriously at all. These are what are often called screwball comedies.Drew Barrymore is Sally, who is mine momhs pregnant She works in a fast food restaurant. Her lover lied to her by claiming was not married. To further complicate matters, Mrs. Lever is lethally jealous. She convinces her son Dorian [Luke Wuksin] and her stepson Angus [Jake Busey] to scare the devil out of the old man by chasing him down a county road in a helicopter. Unfortunately, this gives Dad a fatal heaty attack.The rest if the movie has to do with Angus' trying to save Sally from his totally mad famly.The story is madcap, and the dialog is crisp. Both the photography and the editing are sharp. So we return to the casting problems.Parker Posey would have been ideal as Sally. Kathleen Tuner would have been great as Mrs. Lever.

It's not necessarily a romance &quot;chick flick,&quot; but rather a detour into dark humor with an idiotic plot. By saying &quot;idiotic,&quot; I surely don't mean &quot;bad.&quot; Actually, this kind of movie is perfect for the odd twists and turns it has.It's been very misunderstood probably because of the fact that it was clearly marketed as a &quot;chick flick&quot; -- and when viewers expecting another cute &quot;Never Been Kissed&quot; style movie from the fact that Drew Barrymore is in it -- it gets mostly negative reactions.It's actually a good movie. Perhaps it's an aquired taste; but then there are movies such as &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; that sort of contain the same over the top, macabre humor. And &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; was very popular back in the 80's.A great example of this humor is in place when the mother (Catherine O'Hara) tells one of her two sons that she likes them exactly the same, and holding two fingers a couple inches apart, she says, &quot;with a difference of this much.&quot; And the plot is none the less actually entertaining. It's kind of fun to know what happens next.I'd give it 4 1/2 stars, but there is no &quot;1/2&quot; so 5 stars it'll be.
