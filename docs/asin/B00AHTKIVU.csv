This is a great new movie that seems to keep their attention very well.  My oldest has been doing dance for several years and she was really excited to see this movie.  Overall they loved it and it is a great addition to their collection.This movie is a fantasy style movie where Barbie plays the main ballerina character named Kristyn who is in dance school with big dreams.  After ripping her shoes in rehearsal, she has to find a new pair in the costume department.  She ends up finding a pair of magical sparkling pink shoes that send Kristyn and her friend Hailey into a ballet world.  There they find an evil Snow Queen.  The storyline goes that the girls must dance their favorite ballets to defeat the evil queen and find a way home.  There is some mild conflict with the Snow Queen, but nothing too upsetting for little ones.  The best part about this movie is that your children are exposed to some great classical ballets (Swan Lake and Giselle) and music from famous composers (Tchaikovsky and Beethoven).Overall, the movie was fun and colorful with great CGI graphics.  It has educational value by exposing your children to famous classical ballets and music.  And most of all, the kids love it.  I can't imagine a movie that is more perfect for your little dancer.  Highly Recommended.=========================UPDATE (05/06/2013):So we've had this movie for a few months now and my girls are still really enjoying it.  My oldest, who is now 6, has been doing dance for a while and really loves it.  It is right up her alley.  She has a little dancer doll that she says is Barbie in the Pink Shoes.  Our 3 year old, who is more of a sports kid, is also really liking it.  They have been requesting ""Pink Shoes"" a lot lately.  This past weekend they requested a Barbie movie and they both agreed on this one over ""The Princess & The Popstar"".  It is tough to get them to agree on anything, so this is a big deal for us, especially since it beat out ""Popstar"" in our house.  It keeps their attention and they are really liking it lately... plus they get exposed to some Classical Music.  My 3 year old has even expressed interest in taking a summer dance class, which is a first.

I listen to it all the time and watch this movie as often as possible.Do not just asume like I did at first that just because of the title and that its a Barbie movie that you need children around to enjoy it! Just watch it, and enjoy. I love this about the Barbie movies in general 90% of them are great. There are a few that are not.But this is one of those gems no one expected, and I was one of the nay sayers. The INSTANT I heard the name of the movie I thought it was going to be some fashion snippet type movie without any real soul. MAN was I wrong!So enjoy it, its a wonderful movie, and I really feel like the song at the end is JUST as GOOD as any Disney song out there.Michelle",5,Surprisingly Wonderful,1391299200,"02 2, 2014",2014,866,"[""'m"", '32', 'years', 'old', '34', 've', 'watched', 'child', 'around', 'later', 'nieces', 'nephews', 'too', 'loved', 'feel', 'love', 'song', 'end', 'listen', 'time', 'watch', 'movie', 'as', 'often', 'possible.Do', 'not', 'just', 'did', 'first', 'just', 'title', 'Barbie', 'movie', 'need', 'children', 'enjoy', 'Just', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'love', 'Barbie', 'movies', 'general', '90', '%', 'are', 'great', 'are', 'few', 'are', 'not.But', 'one', 'gems', 'one', 'expected', 'was', 'one', 'nay', 'sayers', 'INSTANT', 'heard', 'name', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'fashion', 'snippet', 'type', 'movie', 'real', 'soul', 'MAN', 'was', 'wrong', 'So', 'enjoy', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'really', 'feel', 'song', 'end', 'JUST', 'as', 'GOOD', 'Disney', 'song', 'out', 'there.Michelle']",Barbie in The Pink Shoes

No cheesy flaky pastry in this movie!! This is the most well written of all of the Barbie movies and the least advertised. The only villain of the main story is realistic and true to life as the stern dance instructor who teaches as she believes is best. Ballet is not Modern Dance. I dislike the cheesy villains in other Barbie features like Mermaidia or Fairytopia, though we loved the scenery and the story teaches good values. Also find Barbie Perfect Christmas for a more original Barbie movie about reminding us that being together is what is most important at Christmas.

1610665,A1KA6VB86QW121,B00AHTKIVU,T-Square,"[66, 86]","Barbie is back in 'Barbie in the Pink Shoes', a return to the classic music and storytelling that put the Barbie movies on the map. I love ALL the Barbie movies from Nutcracker to Princess and the Popstar, but like most fans, I far prefer the earlier classics. In this movie, Barbie (as Kristin) and her friend Hailey are magically transported into a living ballet world where they meet characters from Giselle and Swan Lake, confront the wicked Snow Queen and of course, dance. This movie, while providing a good balance of fantasy and humor, has a mature, almost subdued quality all its own. Possibly because the classic music and dance are such a contrast to the newer Barbie movies. Many children have grown up with these movies, and this one seems to have grown up with them. There has been a conscious effort on the part of the filmmakers in recent years to steer Barbie into a more modern rock-n-roll world, but they don't seem to realize that younger audiences tend to follow their own tastes in music, fashion, etc, before peer pressure influences them into following the crowd instead. Most younger viewers (and listeners) respond to a more civilized look and sound, and I think this fits the bill on both counts.This brings forward the 'message' of the movie, which contends that one should follow one's own heart and not be shackled by conventions. When Barbie dances, the music seems to flow right through her and she deviates from the established choreography to create her own, ultimately winning the day. There are two sides to this contention; while art should not be squeezed into pre-established confines (after all, even 'classical' stuff had to establish itself at some point), traditional music and dance should not be discounted just because it IS traditional (after all, it is considered 'classic' for a reason). The point is, art is subjective and there is no right or wrong (unless it's gimmick-driven or fad-following). Ballet is a particularly traditional art form, but anything done right has its place, be it traditional or otherwise. Everyone has a voice, so let them use it and let the audience decide what works. This movie DOES work, and I recommend it highly.",5,The return of the 'classical' Barbie.,1362009600,"02 28, 2013",2013,2194,"['Barbie', 'back', ""'Barbie"", 'Pink', 'Shoes', 'return', 'classic', 'music', 'storytelling', 'put', 'Barbie', 'movies', 'map', 'love', 'Barbie', 'movies', 'Nutcracker', 'Princess', 'Popstar', 'most', 'fans', 'far', 'prefer', 'earlier', 'classics', 'movie', 'Barbie', 'Kristin', 'friend', 'Hailey', 'are', 'magically', 'transported', 'living', 'ballet', 'world', 'where', 'meet', 'characters', 'Giselle', 'Swan', 'Lake', 'wicked', 'Snow', 'Queen', 'course', 'dance', 'movie', 'providing', 'good', 'balance', 'fantasy', 'humor', 'mature', 'almost', 'subdued', 'quality', 'own', 'Possibly', 'classic', 'music', 'dance', 'are', 'contrast', 'newer', 'Barbie', 'movies', 'Many', 'children', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'movies', 'one', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'been', 'conscious', 'effort', 'part', 'filmmakers', 'recent', 'years', 'steer', 'Barbie', 'more', 'modern', 'rock-n-roll', 'world', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'realize', 'younger', 'audiences', 'tend', 'follow', 'own', 'tastes', 'music', 'fashion', 'etc', 'peer', 'pressure', 'following', 'crowd', 'instead', 'Most', 'younger', 'viewers', 'listeners', 'respond', 'more', 'civilized', 'look', 'sound', 'think', 'bill', 'counts.This', 'forward', ""'message"", 'movie', 'one', 'should', 'follow', 'one', 'own', 'heart', 'not', 'be', 'shackled', 'conventions', 'When', 'Barbie', 'music', 'flow', 'right', 'established', 'choreography', 'create', 'own', 'ultimately', 'winning', 'day', 'are', 'two', 'sides', 'contention', 'art', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'squeezed', 'pre-established', 'confines', 'even', ""'classical"", 'stuff', 'had', 'establish', 'point', 'traditional', 'music', 'dance', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'discounted', 'just', 'traditional', 'considered', ""'classic"", 'reason', 'point', 'art', 'subjective', 'right', 'wrong', 'gimmick-driven', 'fad-following', 'Ballet', 'particularly', 'traditional', 'art', 'form', 'anything', 'done', 'right', 'place', 'be', 'traditional', 'otherwise', 'Everyone', 'voice', 'so', 'let', 'use', 'let', 'audience', 'decide', 'what', 'movie', 'DOES', 'work', 'recommend', 'highly']",Barbie in The Pink Shoes
