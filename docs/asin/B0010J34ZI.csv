1125573,A3GGD7ZWVWIKOU,B0010J34ZI,"Peter P. Fuchs ""&#34;The Meta-Reviewer&#34;""","[4, 172]","I need to edit my important addition to Amazon reviewing here, in light of a snippet of this show I just saw on Catholic cable while unloading the dishwasher. Padre Barron was discussing the ""sin of pride"", and it could not have been more on point for what I have been trying to get across here about this figure. In fact I thank God for giving me this humble kitchen chore to do, so I could hear it, and make the following comment. Barron started by noting that Dante evoked the punishment of the prideful famously in carrying boulders on their backs. He opined that this was to ""bring them down to reality."" Then he discoursed what true humility was, and that such was being in touch ""with reality"". He glossed as well on what you should do to have humility, and  the camera panned several times to reveal roomful of presumably married straight couples. Quite probably a lot have children. With this as his audience what did Barron offer, and what does it reveal about the man's authenticity and honesty?? Well he said that to this group of married people that to get humility they should regularly ""recommend someone else for a promotion or a position you hoped to get."" Now it would be one thing to say that one must see the happenings of the world in the light of faith, and understand that we fit into a merciful scheme in some mysterious and hopeful way in the world. That is true humility in the face of disappointment and misunderstanding at times, in everyone's lives. But this man Barron gave a different and bizarre advice. He went on to say you should actively suggest to the powers- that- be that they choose someone else for position or promotion in order  to practice humility.One can quickly imagine the chain of unfortunate events that would follow for these married people with kids if they followed this confused, pretentious man's advice. In the real world -- in ""reality"" which Barron was ironically just extolling -- a boss would be in his rights to look askance at a person trying to push someone else. The missed opportunity would impact on the ability of this man to support his family. Money problems cause the greatest stress in the home, with anger and often even abusive behavior towards children. And psychological problems for the children who blame themselves tragically. But Barron in his priestly ivory tower is aloof from all these ""realities"".  it is possible, though one can't say for sure, that this bizarre detachment from reality is indicative of real fragmentation in this man, Not only is this bad advice, which has nothing to do with real humility that is hard-won and concrete. It is not mentally healthful advice. Religious, it is immoral advice plain and simple.And then typical of his rather ""word-salad"" presentation style, he then non- sequitored to the idea that true wonderment and humble joy in simple things is like a child staring at a bug. Now this may be a matter of taste, but I don't think staring at a bug is the best metaphor for wonder for most people. And given the foregoing evidence of detachment from reality he evinced, I think it perhaps fair to read this as a telling indication of his own psychic fragmentation on display. His grotesque advice surely displays some sort of fragmentation. But the clincher came when he said -- perahps in a bizarre and twisted attempt to sound ""humble"" -- that apropos this deep and joyous contemplation of insects, his own ""room"" (read ""self"" by depth psychology) is by contrast ""filled with slaughtered bugs!"" That is an exact quote. And we might add slaughtered virtues as well. I believe this man, and his Catholic media prominence could not be a better example of the deep pathology at the heart of reactionary Catholicism. A great shame, for a great religious tradition.Old Review:A very revealing interview with a radio host is available online in which Padre Barron discusses this DVD. It is like a shovel to turn over the soil of Barron's complex and displacing rhetoric. And it shows that he has consciously developed a technique of using great works of art of the West in vast misinterpretation for utter propaganda purposes. The hatchet job he does on the nature of Dante's genius is just perverse. Here is a guy who is in every way trying to gloss over the many corruptions of his Church in his time, and what does he do to Dante, one the most brilliant interpreters of such corruptions?? He makes his famous work into a precis for his own 21st Century  rigid and reactionary approach to existence. It is disgusting and completely intellectually dishonest. Clearly this shows there is no level the guy will not stoop to mollycoddle the current regressive drift of his Church. In his violent misinterpretation Dante's Purgatorio is just about how sins are to be corrected. Huh? The entire beautiful societal sense of these vices, and the enduring aesthetic grid Dante's genius provides for all later critics of Church corruption, is stripped-mined away by Barron. This shows clearly that Barron's whole approach to using works of art, as a presage for his later ""Catholicism"" series, is just to make stuff up. It is a magic trick, and great art is reduced by being chopped in half, like a  beautiful lady in a magician's magic box. Dante  genius was the opposite of Barron's childish approach. He saw the great sins as present dangers imbued in societal evils. That's what they still are, and by what-me-worry oversimplification Mr. Barron is participating in some of the worst.",1,Immoral and Bad Advice on Humility!,1318723200,"10 16,
