1461628,A6GEB06X7QXDJ,B005HZCLXC,Helen,"[0, 0]","This is in response to another review:  This review completely misses the point of the movie--which is to tell the story about a man coming to terms with the loss of his wife, and the grief associated with it.  Besides, there are TONS of movies out there in which the main characters are living in financial circumstances that well exceed that of the general public.  It's all about giving viewers a chance to enjoy a FANTASY WORLD for just a little while.  Esthetic beauty can be a great comfort to people like me, who are very visual.  I LOVED this movie, as I AM DYING OF BREAST CANCER, and I very much appreciated the comforting theme (as did my husband) that we can eventually get beyond our grief to a place of happiness, even joy.  Also, the mountain scenery in this movie was AMAZING.",4,So Comforting to Watch a Truly GOOD Story with GOOD People in it,1401494400,"05 31, 2014",2014,792,"['response', 'review', 'review', 'completely', 'point', 'movie', 'tell', 'story', 'man', 'coming', 'terms', 'loss', 'wife', 'grief', 'associated', 'are', 'TONS', 'movies', 'there', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'living', 'financial', 'circumstances', 'well', 'exceed', 'general', 'public', 'giving', 'viewers', 'chance', 'enjoy', 'FANTASY', 'WORLD', 'just', 'little', 'while', 'Esthetic', 'beauty', 'can', 'be', 'great', 'comfort', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'very', 'visual', 'LOVED', 'movie', 'AM', 'DYING', 'OF', 'BREAST', 'CANCER', 'very', 'much', 'appreciated', 'comforting', 'theme', 'did', 'husband', 'can', 'eventually', 'get', 'grief', 'place', 'happiness', 'even', 'joy', 'Also', 'mountain', 'scenery', 'movie', 'was', 'AMAZING']",Heaven Is Waiting
1461629,AIH35QDMJEJK0,B005HZCLXC,J Book,"[5, 7]","I find no faults with this movie,'cept it could be longer.All the actors did really well in their parts.  Each character pulled off his/her parts with style.  Everyone seemed to fit and were comforable in the clothes they were cast in. The movie moved in a pretty logical pace... perhaps it could have been slower but time constraints of the movie's format determined many things.Dad was perfect in his feelings as a dad and actions of a dad.  He matured nicely...Dad's new squeeze is a bute!  Terribly wise and just the right character for dad to bounce off of.The daughter was cute and cuddley as needed and grown up at just the right times.The boyfriend;  well, he was hard to take at first but also matured with time. (Just like the script-writers wanted.)I can't tell you more about other characters....No give-aways needed. But there is one I wish I could have known in real life...this character has the whole cookie jar as far as I'm concerned.  The character was a perfect best friend for dad.This was a well done, professional flick.  Enjoyed it greatly and will watch it often.  This is really worth more watching.",5,Now this is what I'm talk'en about...!,1319932800,"10 30, 2011",2011,1125,"['find', 'faults', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'longer.All', 'actors', 'did', 'really', 'well', 'parts', 'character', 'pulled', 'off', 'his/her', 'parts', 'style', 'Everyone', 'seemed', 'fit', 'were', 'comforable', 'clothes', 'were', 'cast', 'movie', 'moved', 'pretty', 'logical', 'pace', 'perhaps', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'slower', 'time', 'constraints', 'movie', 'format', 'determined', 'many', 'things.Dad', 'was', 'perfect', 'feelings', 'dad', 'actions', 'dad', 'matured', 'nicely', 'Dad', 'new', 'squeeze', 'bute', 'Terribly', 'wise', 'just', 'right', 'character', 'dad', 'bounce', 'off', 'of.The', 'daughter', 'was', 'cute', 'cuddley', 'needed', 'grown', 'up', 'just', 'right', 'times.The', 'boyfriend', 'well', 'was', 'hard', 'take', 'first', 'also', 'matured', 'time', 'Just', 'script-writers', 'wanted', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'more', 'other', 'characters', 'give-aways', 'needed', 'one', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'known', 'real', 'life', 'character', 'whole', 'cookie', 'jar', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'character', 'was', 'perfect', 'best', 'friend', 'dad.This', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'professional', 'flick', 'Enjoyed', 'greatly', 'will', 'watch', 'often', 'really', 'worth', 'more', 'watching']",Heaven Is Waiting
