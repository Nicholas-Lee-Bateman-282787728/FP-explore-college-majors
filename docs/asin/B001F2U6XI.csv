1187728,A32RF0KJA4ZE6E,B001F2U6XI,Alanna Evans,"[21, 24]","This is such a refreshing, fun series!  I loved everything about it.  Louise reminds me of Lina Inverse from Slayers but where Lina would blow everything up on purpose, poor Louise just blows things up on accident.  Everything seems to go wrong that she touches.  Every magic student has to summon a familiar in their second year.  It's a huge thing, and the students are so proud when they finally get their familiar, only Louise screws this up too and in all the history of the school, she is the only one who has ever summoned... a human.The Japanese boy is quite bewildered to be in a new world with two moons and having a girl claim to be his master (of sorts).  She starts out treating him like a pet/slave (as other familiars are) but it quickly branches out into more than just that.Great music, a fun plot, solid animation and nice character designs make for a very cute and entertaining anime.  There's plenty of comedy and action and its just a great series overall.

Think of this series as a light Inuyasha, just without the demons and ""sword calls"" (you know like Wind Scar but there are spell calls...but that makes more sense :) The story revolves mostly around Louise (who sucks at magic) and her familiar Saito (who happens to be a human of another dimension). Starts off with some comedy, goes into some drama near the middle of the series and then action. Does it do it well, I think so. Not to much of drama or action, but I don't think the creators of this series wanted to make it too dramatic or with too much action. It mainly is a comedy (which is a good call imho). The first series is definitely a keeper (not too fond of the last series they came out with..too eicchi and no focus on story, but that's another review!). Ok animation (could be better.) Music well, ehhh it's ok, but nothing that really stands out. Voice acting is good (I watched it in Japanese with subs so I can't say anything about the dubs.) In all I say 3.5 for a good story line.

1187730,AJ4PUFGZOU71,B001F2U6XI,guy incognito,"[13, 17]","The Familiar of Zero is an anime about a girl's experiences, and her classmates, at a magic academy. The plot revolves around her and her helper's day to day lives in the academy sprinkled in with various missions where students (apparently the most qualified despite being novices) go on tasks to root out problems facing them and their friends/school/country.While the plot itself is dry and not treated very serious, hence it is hard to get drawn into, the bright spot of this anime is the humor. The aim is to throw as many jokes as they can at you in an episode. Be warned that there is a lot of crude humor, whether it be a woman's bust size, misunderstandings of awkward situations, or clothing malfunctions. If this is up your alley, jackpot as this is fanservice 101. But even aside from that, characters, even if 1 or 2 dimensional, are still enjoyable.In addition to humor, there is some romance sprinkled in, but this is one of my biggest problems with these kinds of anime. Its the kind of romance where the intended couple briefly hooks up, breaks up, loves each other, than hates, there is very little progression in their relationship, and usually its romance followed by humor, not giving the romance a real chance to grow.Recap, after you watch it you may forget the plot and some of the characters, but you'll have a lotta laughs in the process.",3,Enjoyable but forgettable,1233792000,"02 5, 2009",2009,1364,"['Familiar', 'Zero', 'anime', 'girl', 'experiences', 'classmates', 'magic', 'academy', 'plot', 'helper', 'day', 'day', 'lives', 'academy', 'sprinkled', 'various', 'missions', 'where', 'students', 'apparently', 'most', 'qualified', 'being', 'novices', 'go', 'tasks', 'root', 'out', 'problems', 'facing', 'friends/school/country.While', 'plot', 'dry', 'not', 'treated', 'very', 'serious', 'hence', 'hard', 'get', 'drawn', 'bright', 'spot', 'anime', 'humor', 'aim', 'throw', 'many', 'jokes', 'can', 'episode', 'Be', 'warned', 'lot', 'crude', 'humor', 'be', 'woman', 'bust', 'size', 'misunderstandings', 'awkward', 'situations', 'clothing', 'malfunctions', 'up', 'alley', 'jackpot', 'fanservice', '101', 'even', 'aside', 'characters', 'even', '1', '2', 'dimensional', 'are', 'still', 'enjoyable.In', 'addition', 'humor', 'romance', 'sprinkled', 'one', 'biggest', 'problems', 'kinds', 'anime', 'kind', 'romance', 'where', 'intended', 'couple', 'briefly', 'up', 'up', 'loves', 'other', 'hates', 'very', 'little', 'progression', 'relationship', 'usually', 'romance', 'followed', 'humor', 'not', 'giving', 'romance', 'real', 'chance', 'grow.Recap', 'watch', 'may', 'forget', 'plot', 'characters', ""'ll"", 'have', 'lotta', 'process']",The Familiar of Zero

In her world, the social status of a person depends on their ability to use magic. Although her family is well respected, Louise hasn't ever successfully used magic. She has earned the nickname ""Zero"", for her 0% success rate. One day, when her class is summoning familiars, she summons a young man from Earth named Seito. She is ashamed that she summoned a peasant. She puts him to work doing her chores, but he quickly grows on her. Seito also has a strange power which has a mysterious connection to Louise's magic. As they become close, the world begins to crumble around them. Their bond will be the only hope for the future.This anime was a lot of fun. It seems shallow and silly at first, but halfway through a great story develops. I found myself starting to tear up a little bit at times. There are some great characters, and a really good story. The animation and soundtrack are both really well done. The voice acting is slightly above average. There are some suggestive situations in this series, but no sex or nudity. 13 and up is probably a good rating. My only complaint is that this series is broken up into several short seasons. Geneon closed and left only this 1st season behind. It has also been subject to greedy people asking a ridiculous amount for it. You're lucky if you can find it for under $200. I payed too much for this, and it really bugs me, but I really enjoyed this series. I think you should watch it online and decide whether or not to break the bank on this set.

For starters the show is fun, lighthearted, and good.  It starts off well and it ends well.  If you like Anime, than you need to pick this one up.The rights to this show were first given to Geneon, but they dropped it and Funimation picked it up, and delivered this 3 disked box set.  This is not a slim pack, what you get are three full case DVD's with a box that holds all three DVD cases.  The box has good art work, and the DVDs them self's have reversible covers.  The special features are not really worthy to be mentioned.  As with all Anime almost, you get the standard special features. Clean Opening, Clean ending, previews, and some art work, also some promo stuff, but not much.The video and art of the show is really good, not too flashy, but not dull.  The audio is top notch, and the dubbing is superb.  As with all Anime there is going to be people that hate the English voice acting, but in this Anime the English dub is really good.After this season of Zero there is two more seasons, which each has 12 new episodes.  Buy this  box set, it is a great deal for 13 episodes of a great, and fun Anime.Update:Just got a letter from Fanimation (I wrote them), they have said that they do not plan to release the other two seasons.  :-(  I guess not enough people bought this.

1187735,AFV2584U13XP3,B001F2U6XI,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),"[1, 1]","The series is to be taken with the knowledge that it's neither an all round action anime or drama anime but more of a mix of light drama, magical abilities, and a dash of romance.  The characters are very entertaining to watch and seeing the situations they get into most of the times will leave you with a chuckle.  The main characters Louise a young female aristocrat with almost zero magical talent thus earning her nickname Louise The Zero inadvertently summons a young man from our world to hers in a botched summoning spell to call for personal familiar to appear to her( A familiar being a mystical animal or normal animal but with unique qualities that helps her or his wizard master).  Of course the young man Hiraga Saito neither knowing what's going on or where he is finds himself out of his league and under the overbearing dominion of his so called master,  but later as he adjusts to his new world he finds he has a unique ability to fight with unusual power and ability(Nothing truly superhuman).  The hijinx that happens between Louise and Saito as they slowly begin to at first befriend than fall in love will leave you laughing and feeling a little heartfelt tug throughout the series.  The series is widescreen and the cast for the English voice overs were very good for their roles as was of course the Japanese cast, the extras aren't much just the standard trailers and textless intro/ending songs. There is a lot of fan service in the series itself but nothing to r-rated to worry about and nothing to steamy beyond kissing for the most part so no need to unduly worry about anything to badly.  The one thing I appreciate with Funimation doing is having the complete series set be a decent design,  meaning the set is three standard dvd cases put into a thin cardboard box sleeve with the main female character on both sides instead of just doing the set like their recent complete box sets(Air Gear, Guyver, Mushi Ishi to just name a few).

The animation is by JC Staff and is rated 13 and up due to the amount of ""tastefully positioned fanservice"" To give a catch-all statement about this series think. ""A Conneticuit Yankee in King Arthur's Court"", by Mark Twain, Meets ""The Taming of the Shrew"", by William Shakespeare, meets ""Harry Potter"" Series by J.K. Rowling. Place in an Anime blender and Voilla!The story is of a paralel world where magic exists and humans who are able to use it are called Mages, ordinary people are called peasants. Periodically, in this world, gateways open to our world and people get stuck in this magicly charged land. One day Saito our hero, is walking through the streets of a major Japanese city. He sees a gateway that aparently no one else sees and is sucked in. To his horror, he is now the quintisential stranger in a strange land. Aparently now the familiar of an unsuccessful magic girl named Louise, called Louise the Zero by her classmates due to her unsuccessful use of magic. Some ""binding contract is invoked between them when she kisses him.A binding contract? With no Quid Pro Quo, and no mutual asscent. Well Mr. Saito like any modern human from a 1st world country chooses to ignore most of what his new master Louise says and do his own thing when he chooses. Over the course of the series we see a deepening of Louise and Saito's relationship as he begins to take on a roll as more a protector than as a servant. Louise is clearly attracted to Saito and is insanly jealous when he interacts with other girls. Refering to Saito more than one time as a ""dog"". But her noble standing prevents her from expressing to Saito how she feels about him. Saito for his part grows to respect Louise an possibly even love her in a way, but he is a bit of a lothario and the center of the attention of females other than Louise. That does not in any way make this a harem anime though as Louise exerts her ""ownership"" of Saito drawing him back every time.The thiteen episodes of this anime were not enough to bring the plot to fruition. A viewer is left wanting more story development and more subtext. I realize that shows like this are cranked out fast and have to ""work for TV"" but it leaves the viewer with some loose ends which this reviewer would like to see tied up. Theres pleanty of room here for a well developed second series or a movie. bt since this was a 2005 title in Japan we probably won't see it.If you are at all into paralel worlds, magic, or romances I'd recomend the Familiar of Zero for their slate of viewing and a place in their home video/DVD library.",5,Zero Regret,1238976000,"04 6, 2009",2009,2695,"['Zero', 'No', 'Tsukaima', 'Familiar', 'oz', 'Zero', 'one', 'titles', 'saved', 're-issued', '2008', 'Funimation', 'Entertainment', 'animation', 'JC', 'Staff', 'rated', '13', 'up', 'due', 'amount', 'tastefully', 'positioned', 'fanservice', 'give', 'catch-all', 'statement', 'series', 'think', 'Conneticuit', 'Yankee', 'King', 'Arthur', 'Court', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'Meets', 'Taming', 'Shrew', 'William', 'Shakespeare', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Series', 'J.K.', 'Rowling', 'Place', 'Anime', 'blender', 'Voilla', 'story', 'paralel', 'world', 'where', 'magic', 'exists', 'humans', 'who', 'are', 'able', 'use', 'are', 'called', 'Mages', 'ordinary', 'people', 'are', 'called', 'peasants', 'Periodically', 'world', 'open', 'world', 'people', 'get', 'stuck', 'magicly', 'charged', 'land', 'One', 'day', 'Saito', 'hero', 'walking', 'streets', 'major', 'Japanese', 'city', 'gateway', 'aparently', 'one', 'else', 'sucked', 'horror', 'now', 'quintisential', 'stranger', 'strange', 'land', 'Aparently', 'now', 'familiar', 'unsuccessful', 'magic', 'girl', 'named', 'Louise', 'called', 'Louise', 'Zero', 'classmates', 'due', 'unsuccessful', 'use', 'magic', 'binding', 'contract', 'invoked', 'when', 'him.A', 'binding', 'contract', 'Quid', 'Pro', 'Quo', 'mutual', 'asscent', 'Well', 'Mr.', 'Saito', 'modern', 'human', '1st', 'world', 'country', 'ignore', 'most', 'what', 'new', 'master', 'Louise', 'do', 'own', 'thing', 'when', 'course', 'series', 'see', 'deepening', 'Louise', 'Saito', 'relationship', 'take', 'roll', 'more', 'protector', 'servant', 'Louise', 'clearly', 'attracted', 'Saito', 'insanly', 'jealous', 'when', 'other', 'girls', 'Refering', 'Saito', 'more', 'one', 'time', 'dog', 'noble', 'standing', 'prevents', 'expressing', 'Saito', 'how', 'Saito', 'part', 'respect', 'Louise', 'possibly', 'even', 'love', 'way', 'bit', 'lothario', 'center', 'attention', 'females', 'other', 'Louise', 'not', 'way', 'make', 'harem', 'anime', 'Louise', 'ownership', 'Saito', 'drawing', 'back', 'time.The', 'thiteen', 'episodes', 'anime', 'were', 'not', 'enough', 'bring', 'plot', 'fruition', 'viewer', 'left', 'wanting', 'more', 'story', 'development', 'more', 'subtext', 'realize', 'are', 'cranked', 'fast', 'have', 'work', 'TV', 'viewer', 'loose', 'ends', 'reviewer', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'tied', 'up', 'Theres', 'pleanty', 'room', 'here', 'well', 'developed', 'second', 'series', 'movie', 'bt', 'was', '2005', 'title', 'Japan', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'it.If', 'are', 'paralel', 'worlds', 'magic', 'romances', ""'d"", 'recomend', 'Familiar', 'Zero', 'slate', 'viewing', 'place', 'home', 'video/DVD', 'library']",The Familiar of Zero
