Yes, it's a little pricey for 10 episodes but still worth it for fans.This being a MOD offering, the discs themselves have basic white labels with text in black (similar to the BRIDGET LOVES BERNIE or CHARLIE'S ANGELS Season Five set from Sony). The menus are VERY generic and do not feature any photos or thumbnails from the show; just a boring background with episode titles for selection. There is a PLAY ALL feature but NO chapter stops within the episodes themselves, nor any close-captioning for the hearing-impaired.",4,The Big C Season 3,1371254400,"06 15, 2013",2013,688,"[""'re"", 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'cable', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'hate', 'watching', 'streaming', 'TV', 'shows', 'PC', 'course', 'will', 'want', 'spring', 'Yes', 'little', 'pricey', '10', 'episodes', 'still', 'fans.This', 'being', 'MOD', 'offering', 'discs', 'have', 'basic', 'white', 'labels', 'text', 'black', 'similar', 'BRIDGET', 'LOVES', 'BERNIE', 'CHARLIE', 'ANGELS', 'Season', 'Five', 'set', 'Sony', 'menus', 'are', 'VERY', 'generic', 'do', 'not', 'feature', 'photos', 'thumbnails', 'show', 'just', 'boring', 'background', 'episode', 'titles', 'selection', 'PLAY', 'ALL', 'feature', 'NO', 'chapter', 'stops', 'episodes', 'close-captioning', 'hearing-impaired']",N/A

However, if you are not a die hard fan of this series I don't recommend it. Very quick watch though, finished the whole season on a Thursday night after work, partly because I just kept waiting for something phenomenal to happen.Other seasons were emotional roller coasters full of highs and lows; this felt more like rusty bumper cars that as soon as you get the hang of the handicap steering wheel the ride is over and that few seconds of triumph you had is now long gone.But, like I said before if you have followed Cathy's awkward struggle and fell in love with Sean and Andrea as the heroic supporting characters then you should watch this season.

Cathy's cancer goes into remission and greed transforms her new temporary lease on life. Paul receives a new lease on life and strives to be a well known blogger with the aid of his new sly mentor. Sean finds a new questionable career that leads him into a love triangle. Adam finds religion and manipulates it for his own selfish gain. Andrea turns into the peace keeper in the family.  Season 3 is not as humorous as the past couple of seasons.
