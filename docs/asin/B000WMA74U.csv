I don't wish to take anything away from other team members because it is truely a team sport.  But to me no one else has been as consistant in the game and in life as Kurt.  A real fairy tale ledgend in sports history.  I would reccommend these movies to all sports fans.",5,The greatest football player ever.,1375142400,"07 30, 2013",2013,398,"['Kurt', 'Warner', 'epitomy', 'what', 'sports', 'star', 'should', 'be', 'was', 'outstanding', 'player', 'father', 'husband', 'person', 'do', ""n't"", 'wish', 'take', 'anything', 'away', 'other', 'team', 'members', 'truely', 'team', 'sport', 'one', 'else', 'been', 'consistant', 'game', 'life', 'Kurt', 'real', 'fairy', 'tale', 'ledgend', 'sports', 'history', 'would', 'reccommend', 'movies', 'sports', 'fans']",NFL Greatest Games: St. Louis Rams 1999 Playoffs
1110571,A3BULYOZZBJ2Q,B000WMA74U,T.V. Terry,"[0, 0]","This team effectively came out of nowhere, going, in a few short months, from also-rans who had no business being competitive--let alone a contending team--to becoming the Greatest Show on Turf, culminating with a Super Bowl Championship.  Behind it all was a quarterback who came out of nowhere to go from an undrafted free-agent third-string mop-up man in his official rookie season in 1998...to a promoted back-up quarterback in 1999...to a starter when the starting quarterback went down in pre-season...who took this team on an unforgettable ride any football fan can NEVER deny!!!! Despite the limitedness of these games, being on DVD, of course, in 4:3 formation, these games are still wonderful to have, nonetheless!!!!!!  And anyone who truly appreciates football can appreciate this team, this season and these original post-season broadcasts.  I also had a blast living during 1999, and these games are a time capsule which ties nicely into those sweet memories about a sweet period, a great, memorably fun year for me and a truly great team.",5,ANOTHER FINE FOOTBALL TIME CAPSULE,1392681600,"02 18, 2014",2014,1053,"['team', 'effectively', 'came', 'nowhere', 'going', 'few', 'short', 'months', 'also-rans', 'who', 'had', 'business', 'being', 'competitive', 'let', 'alone', 'contending', 'team', 'becoming', 'Greatest', 'Show', 'Turf', 'culminating', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'Championship', 'was', 'quarterback', 'who', 'came', 'nowhere', 'go', 'undrafted', 'free-agent', 'third-string', 'mop-up', 'man', 'official', 'rookie', 'season', '1998', 'promoted', 'back-up', 'quarterback', '1999', 'starter', 'when', 'starting', 'quarterback', 'went', 'down', 'pre-season', 'who', 'took', 'team', 'unforgettable', 'ride', 'football', 'fan', 'can', 'NEVER', 'deny', 'limitedness', 'games', 'being', 'DVD', 'course', '4:3', 'formation', 'games', 'are', 'still', 'wonderful', 'have', 'nonetheless', 'anyone', 'who', 'truly', 'football', 'can', 'appreciate', 'team', 'season', 'original', 'post-season', 'broadcasts', 'also', 'had', 'blast', 'living', '1999', 'games', 'are', 'time', 'capsule', 'nicely', 'sweet', 'memories', 'sweet', 'period', 'great', 'memorably', 'fun', 'year', 'truly', 'great', 'team']",NFL Greatest Games: St. Louis Rams 1999 Playoffs
1110572,AQYSBQWES50MO,B000WMA74U,VWC,"[22, 26]","Yes, these games are taken from the original network broadcasts.  However, they have been chopped or shortened to the point of irritation.  The makers of this DVD could not even wait for certain sentences out of the broadcasters mouths to be finished before they fade out to the next segments.  Many replays are gone and there is no pre-game coverage.  The thing that disappointed and actually shocked me the most though was on the Super Bowl disc. Just over 5 seconds after the game ends, the DVD ends!!!  After the most memorable finish in Super Bowl history, there is absolutely no coverage of post game or celebration of ANY kind!!!  Why???  Most people who are interested in purchasing this collection are probably Rams fans.  Did they think we would be bored by watching the COMPLETE broadcast?  If you already have a decent copy of these games recorded from television, do yourself a favor and hold on to those instead of buying this.  If you are a casual fan, I suppose it's better than nothing.",1,VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!,1199059200,"12 31, 2007",2007,1003,"['Yes', 'games', 'are', 'taken', 'original', 'network', 'broadcasts', 'However', 'have', 'been', 'chopped', 'shortened', 'point', 'irritation', 'makers', 'DVD', 'could', 'not', 'even', 'wait', 'certain', 'sentences', 'broadcasters', 'mouths', 'be', 'finished', 'fade', 'out', 'next', 'segments', 'Many', 'replays', 'are', 'gone', 'pre-game', 'coverage', 'thing', 'disappointed', 'actually', 'shocked', 'most', 'was', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'disc', 'Just', '5', 'seconds', 'game', 'DVD', 'most', 'memorable', 'finish', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'history', 'absolutely', 'coverage', 'post', 'game', 'celebration', 'ANY', 'kind', 'Why', 'Most', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'purchasing', 'collection', 'are', 'probably', 'Rams', 'fans', 'Did', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'bored', 'watching', 'COMPLETE', 'broadcast', 'already', 'have', 'decent', 'copy', 'games', 'recorded', 'television', 'do', 'favor', 'hold', 'instead', 'buying', 'are', 'casual', 'fan', 'suppose', 'better', 'nothing']",NFL Greatest Games: St. Louis Rams 1999 Playoffs
1110573,A2APIUMCS1ZCN9,B000WMA74U,Wilcy Moore,"[25, 26]","FYI - These games are not complete.  The Super Bowl game has 13 plays edited out of it, including nearly all of a Rams scoring drive in the second quarter.  The fades to and from commercials are the most abrupt I've seen yet.  They don't even let the announcer finish a sentence.  Also, the disc ends with the most exciting final play of a Super Bowl, and they cut it off immediately after the official rules Dyson down.  A couple of different replay angles sure would have been nice.  Oh yeah, one other thing - the aspect ratio is listed in the product detail as being 1.66:1.  It isn't.  It's actually 1.33:1.",1,Edited Games,1202515200,"02 9, 2008",2008,612,"['FYI', 'games', 'are', 'not', 'complete', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'game', '13', 'plays', 'edited', 'including', 'nearly', 'Rams', 'scoring', 'drive', 'second', 'quarter', 'fades', 'commercials', 'are', 'most', 'abrupt', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'yet', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'let', 'announcer', 'finish', 'sentence', 'Also', 'disc', 'most', 'exciting', 'final', 'play', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'cut', 'off', 'immediately', 'official', 'rules', 'Dyson', 'down', 'couple', 'different', 'replay', 'angles', 'sure', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'one', 'other', 'thing', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'listed', 'product', 'detail', 'being', '1.66:1', ""n't"", 'actually', '1.33:1']",NFL Greatest Games: St. Louis Rams 1999 Playoffs
