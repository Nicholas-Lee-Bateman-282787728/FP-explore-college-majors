1538442,A1URXSRV6WDHVY,B007V4QLWE,Marty Gillis,"[0, 0]","I am a fan of both Tom Bosley and Tracy Nelson and also a huge mystery fan. I was sad to see Tom leave Murder She Wrote as I always enjoyed the Cabot Cove episodes with Sheriff Tupper, but was happy he got his own show and always enjoyed Father Dowling Mysteries. It is a formula show and some are better written and cast than others, but the two lead characters carried things nicely and it is a good ""cozy"" on a stormy day with a hot cup of tea. With that said, this review will examine the product itself, both the video, audio, special features and packaging, rather than the series itself.When 'Father Dowling Mysteries' was announced for DVD it went straight to my wish list. I now have both Season One and Two and other than the broadcast network that showed them (NBC, then ABC), they both have much in common as far as the product is concerned so much of my review for Season One and Two are interchangeable and identical. It seems the 2nd Season upped the ante with more graphic and bloody violence.  Perhaps the suits at ABC thought the show needed more blood and gore. On a positive side, the writing seems a bit tighter in the 2nd Season with faster pacing and a more realistic sense of menace from the killers. I would be interested to see where Season 3 takes the show and hope it is released soon.This review is somewhat technical so if you are not into that sort of thing, I can give you my verdict here and now! Video Quality is crummy, sound fares much better and the packaging is cheap with non existent special features.Ok, on with the gory details!You get two DVD's with Season One and Three with Season Two. There is not artwork in the discs and they are a thinner variety of media than I would have liked. Also, the cases are bare bones with the dreaded Eco styling which is almost as much air as plastic. Episode names are inside the case and for the most part behind the discs so you need to remove the discs to see what shows are on what disc. El-Cheapo!How about the video quality? IN a word: LOUSY! It is readily apparent that CBS home video used video tape masters for this transfer. I am talking broadcast video tape but what appears to be at least 1 or 2 generations DOWN from the original. To make up for the horrible bad video quality, there has been an abundance of edge enhancement added and that actually works AGAINST itself as it introduces other unwanted video artifacts into the picture. Don't get me wrong. They ARE watchable, but long shorts are blurry, medium shots are ""acceptable"" and close-ups are ""ok"" but NONE of it looks all that great. The colors are fine pretty much and the motion is encoded correctly at least.I am going to make a guess that 'Father Dowling Mysteries' was edited on video tape after principal photography to save both time and money, much like the later years of Murder She Wrote and as such it is cost prohibitive to return to the original negatives as Viacom most likely used an inter-positive made from the film and transferred THAT to tape, the edited the shows causing another drop in generation resolution. ANYWAY, because of all of this, it is unlikely this show will EVER look any better on home video than it does with these transfers, as sad as that may be. Phooey! It was a huge mistake for production companies to edit on tape as far as the future home video market was concerned. Luckily, shows like Columbo fare much better on DVD thanks to being both shot and edited on film. (until the very last few years on ABC)How about the sound? Well, that is the GOOD NEWS about this product. The sound is presented in Dolby Digital stereo and as such you can use your surround receivers decoder to give you Pro Logic Surround which is both convincing and sounds very good actually. Music sounds excellent and dialogue is crisp and clear. It is a real shame the picture quality is so poor and not presented at the same level of quality as the audio.No special features really, just the network teasers which are tacked on to each episode page and touted as a special feature when in fact they are not. No interviews, no commentaries, nothing. Phooey again!Bottom line, if you enjoy this show then you really have no choice but to purchase these sets as they exist now since it is highly unlikely they will EVER see another home video release. I still find them very enjoyable and do not regret my purchase, just be warned the video quality isn't even as good as a good VHS transfer at times. 'Father Dowling Mysteries' deserved more, better video and better packaging but like Rodney Dangerfield, it just got no respect at all!",4,"Good Show, Horrendous Transfer!",1353456000,"11 21, 2012",2012,4603,"['am', 'fan', 'Tom', 'Bosley', 'Tracy', 'Nelson', 'also', 'huge', 'mystery', 'fan', 'was', 'sad', 'see', 'Tom', 'leave', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'Cabot', 'Cove', 'Sheriff', 'Tupper', 'was', 'happy', 'got', 'own', 'show', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'Father', 'Dowling', 'Mysteries', 'formula', 'show', 'are', 'better', 'written', 'cast', 'others', 'two', 'lead', 'characters', 'carried', 'things', 'nicely', 'good', 'cozy', 'stormy', 'day', 'hot', 'cup', 'tea', 'said', 'review', 'will', 'examine', 'product', 'video', 'audio', 'special', 'features', 'packaging', 'rather', 'series', 'itself.When', 'Dowling', 'Mysteries', 'was', 'announced', 'DVD', 'went', 'straight', 'wish', 'list', 'now', 'have', 'Season', 'One', 'Two', 'other', 'broadcast', 'network', 'showed', 'NBC', 'then', 'ABC', 'have', 'much', 'common', 'as', 'far', 'product', 'concerned', 'so', 'much', 'review', 'Season', 'One', 'Two', 'are', 'interchangeable', 'identical', '2nd', 'Season', 'upped', 'ante', 'more', 'graphic', 'bloody', 'violence', 'Perhaps', 'suits', 'ABC', 'thought', 'show', 'needed', 'more', 'blood', 'gore', 'positive', 'side', 'writing', 'bit', 'tighter', '2nd', 'Season', 'faster', 'pacing', 'more', 'realistic', 'sense', 'menace', 'killers', 'would', 'be', 'interested', 'see', 'where', 'Season', '3', 'show', 'hope', 'released', 'soon.This', 'review', 'somewhat', 'technical', 'so', 'are', 'not', 'sort', 'thing', 'can', 'give', 'verdict', 'here', 'now', 'Video', 'Quality', 'crummy', 'sound', 'fares', 'much', 'better', 'packaging', 'cheap', 'non', 'existent', 'special', 'features.Ok', 'gory', 'details', 'get', 'two', 'DVD', 'Season', 'One', 'Three', 'Season', 'Two', 'not', 'artwork', 'discs', 'are', 'thinner', 'variety', 'media', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'Also', 'cases', 'are', 'bare', 'bones', 'dreaded', 'Eco', 'styling', 'almost', 'as', 'much', 'air', 'plastic', 'Episode', 'names', 'are', 'case', 'most', 'part', 'discs', 'need', 'remove', 'discs', 'see', 'what', 'shows', 'are', 'what', 'disc', 'El-Cheapo', 'How', 'video', 'quality', 'word', 'LOUSY', 'readily', 'apparent', 'CBS', 'home', 'video', 'used', 'video', 'tape', 'masters', 'transfer', 'am', 'talking', 'broadcast', 'video', 'tape', 'what', 'be', 'least', '1', '2', 'generations', 'DOWN', 'original', 'make', 'up', 'horrible', 'bad', 'video', 'quality', 'been', 'abundance', 'edge', 'enhancement', 'added', 'actually', 'AGAINST', 'other', 'unwanted', 'video', 'artifacts', 'picture', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'ARE', 'watchable', 'long', 'shorts', 'are', 'blurry', 'medium', 'shots', 'are', 'acceptable', 'close-ups', 'are', 'ok', 'NONE', 'great', 'colors', 'are', 'fine', 'pretty', 'much', 'motion', 'encoded', 'correctly', 'least.I', 'am', 'going', 'make', 'guess', 'Dowling', 'Mysteries', 'was', 'edited', 'video', 'tape', 'principal', 'photography', 'save', 'time', 'money', 'much', 'later', 'years', 'Murder', 'Wrote', 'such', 'cost', 'prohibitive', 'return', 'original', 'negatives', 'Viacom', 'most', 'likely', 'used', 'inter-positive', 'made', 'film', 'transferred', 'THAT', 'tape', 'edited', 'shows', 'causing', 'drop', 'generation', 'resolution', 'ANYWAY', 'unlikely', 'show', 'will', 'EVER', 'look', 'better', 'home', 'video', 'transfers', 'as', 'sad', 'may', 'be', 'Phooey', 'was', 'huge', 'mistake', 'production', 'companies', 'edit', 'tape', 'as', 'far', 'future', 'home', 'video', 'market', 'was', 'concerned', 'Luckily', 'shows', 'Columbo', 'fare', 'much', 'better', 'DVD', 'thanks', 'being', 'shot', 'edited', 'film', 'very', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'ABC', 'How', 'sound', 'Well', 'GOOD', 'NEWS', 'product', 'sound', 'presented', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'stereo', 'such', 'can', 'use', 'surround', 'receivers', 'decoder', 'give', 'Pro', 'Logic', 'Surround', 'convincing', 'sounds', 'very', 'good', 'actually', 'Music', 'excellent', 'dialogue', 'crisp', 'clear', 'real', 'shame', 'picture', 'quality', 'so', 'poor', 'not', 'presented', 'same', 'level', 'quality', 'audio.No', 'special', 'features', 'really', 'just', 'network', 'teasers', 'are', 'tacked', 'episode', 'page', 'touted', 'special', 'feature', 'when', 'fact', 'are', 'not', 'No', 'interviews', 'commentaries', 'nothing', 'Phooey', 'again', 'Bottom', 'line', 'enjoy', 'show', 'then', 'really', 'have', 'choice', 'purchase', 'sets', 'exist', 'now', 'highly', 'unlikely', 'will', 'EVER', 'see', 'home', 'video', 'release', 'still', 'find', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'do', 'not', 'regret', 'purchase', 'just', 'be', 'warned', 'video', 'quality', ""n't"", 'even', 'as', 'good', 'good', 'VHS', 'transfer', 'times', 'Dowling', 'Mysteries', 'deserved', 'more', 'better', 'video', 'better', 'packaging', 'Rodney', 'Dangerfield', 'just', 'got', 'respect']",N/A

1538459,ATB8MP2M9L5PM,B007V4QLWE,"Transcendental Thomist ""jeb815""","[0, 0]","In one convenient DVD snap case with three discs, you get all of the episodes from Season 2 of the ""Father Dowling Mysteries"" originally aired in 1990, a delightful collection of 45-minute episodes with colorful murder mysteries set (and actually filmed) in Chicago and based on the Father Dowling mysteries (books and short stories) of the late Notre Dame philosophy Professor Ralph McInerny. This season offers more episodes than Season 1, but fewer than Season 3, and I find it (I have yet to watch Season 3) a step down in quality from Season 1. After NBC cancelled the show following Season 1, it moved from NBC to ABC, where its remaining two seasons aired. Tom Bosley (""Happy Days"") as Father Dowling, Tracy Nelson as street-smart Sister Steve, and Mary Wickes as Marie Murkin the acerbic housekeeper are again excellent in Season 2. Father Prestwick, everyone's favorite hapless assistant pastor, gets a welcome expansion of his comic relief role, appearing in every episode here whereas he had only appeared twice in Season 1.Unfortunately, the Season 2 episodes are more predictable and somewhat uneven in their writing than Season 1, often recycling the same themes (corrupt city officials, black sheeps in the families of our heroes, etc.) while giving us mysteries that are no very mysterious and moments (like Bosley's Father Dowling impersonating a mobster at a Chicago mafioso hangout) that are so campy they make your jaw drop in the contrast from Season 1. Season 1 was somewhat unpredictable, offering unpredictable mysteries and intelligently plotted drama with decent guest stars that always left you waiting for the next show. This season descends into gimmick episodes (Halloween special) and repeated visits to sleazy venues like strip clubs to hold interest, playing up the whimsy (Father Dowling, a Catholic priest who solves mysteries in his parish's backyard, is an inherently implausible character) while reducing the verisimilitude that made Season 1 such a satisfying mix. It feels like there was an effort behind the scenes to boost ratings by camping things up a bit here, but the quality is still pretty high in a series that had already changed many key details (like Father Dowling's first name and ability to drive, not to mention the addition of Sister Steve) from the books.This season still features some of the best TV murder mystery writing you will find, relying more on delightful character interactions than on CGI effects as in today's CSI-style procedurals, but the show becomes a bit formulaic in this season. In many of the the McInerny stories, Father Dowling spends most of his time solving murders in the parish senior center, and the TV show seeks a less geriatric audience with additions like the always-delightful and spontaneous Sister Steve. It just starts to get a bit stale at this point.",5,"Great series, but a cut below Season 1",1387929600,"12 25, 2013",2013,2847,"['one', 'convenient', 'DVD', 'case', 'three', 'discs', 'get', 'episodes', 'Season', '2', 'Father', 'Dowling', 'Mysteries', 'originally', 'aired', '1990', 'delightful', 'collection', '45-minute', 'episodes', 'colorful', 'murder', 'mysteries', 'set', 'actually', 'filmed', 'Chicago', 'based', 'Father', 'Dowling', 'mysteries', 'books', 'short', 'stories', 'late', 'Notre', 'Dame', 'philosophy', 'Professor', 'Ralph', 'McInerny', 'season', 'more', 'episodes', 'Season', '1', 'fewer', 'Season', '3', 'find', 'have', 'yet', 'watch', 'Season', '3', 'step', 'down', 'quality', 'Season', '1', 'NBC', 'cancelled', 'show', 'following', 'Season', '1', 'moved', 'NBC', 'ABC', 'where', 'remaining', 'two', 'seasons', 'aired', 'Tom', 'Bosley', 'Happy', 'Days', 'Father', 'Dowling', 'Tracy', 'Nelson', 'street-smart', 'Sister', 'Steve', 'Mary', 'Wickes', 'Marie', 'Murkin', 'acerbic', 'housekeeper', 'are', 'again', 'excellent', 'Season', '2', 'Father', 'Prestwick', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'hapless', 'assistant', 'pastor', 'welcome', 'expansion', 'comic', 'relief', 'role', 'appearing', 'episode', 'here', 'had', 'only', 'appeared', 'twice', 'Season', '1.Unfortunately', 'Season', '2', 'episodes', 'are', 'more', 'predictable', 'somewhat', 'uneven', 'writing', 'Season', '1', 'often', 'recycling', 'same', 'themes', 'corrupt', 'city', 'officials', 'black', 'sheeps', 'families', 'heroes', 'etc', 'giving', 'mysteries', 'are', 'very', 'mysterious', 'moments', 'Bosley', 'Father', 'Dowling', 'impersonating', 'mobster', 'Chicago', 'mafioso', 'hangout', 'are', 'so', 'campy', 'make', 'jaw', 'drop', 'contrast', 'Season', '1', 'Season', '1', 'was', 'somewhat', 'unpredictable', 'offering', 'unpredictable', 'mysteries', 'intelligently', 'plotted', 'drama', 'decent', 'guest', 'stars', 'always', 'left', 'waiting', 'next', 'show', 'season', 'gimmick', 'episodes', 'Halloween', 'special', 'repeated', 'visits', 'sleazy', 'venues', 'strip', 'clubs', 'hold', 'interest', 'playing', 'up', 'whimsy', 'Father', 'Dowling', 'Catholic', 'priest', 'who', 'mysteries', 'parish', 'backyard', 'inherently', 'implausible', 'character', 'reducing', 'verisimilitude', 'made', 'Season', '1', 'satisfying', 'mix', 'was', 'effort', 'scenes', 'boost', 'ratings', 'camping', 'things', 'up', 'bit', 'here', 'quality', 'still', 'pretty', 'high', 'series', 'had', 'already', 'changed', 'many', 'key', 'details', 'Father', 'Dowling', 'first', 'name', 'ability', 'drive', 'not', 'mention', 'addition', 'Sister', 'Steve', 'books.This', 'season', 'still', 'best', 'TV', 'murder', 'mystery', 'writing', 'will', 'find', 'relying', 'more', 'delightful', 'character', 'interactions', 'CGI', 'effects', 'today', 'CSI-style', 'procedurals', 'show', 'bit', 'formulaic', 'season', 'many', 'McInerny', 'stories', 'Father', 'Dowling', 'most', 'time', 'solving', 'murders', 'parish', 'senior', 'center', 'TV', 'show', 'less', 'geriatric', 'audience', 'additions', 'always-delightful', 'spontaneous', 'Sister', 'Steve', 'just', 'get', 'bit', 'stale', 'point']",N/A
