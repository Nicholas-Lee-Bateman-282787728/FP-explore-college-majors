I am anxiously awaiting Season 6 and I miss the people. I may have to watch Season 5 over again until I get Season 6. I feel like part of family. I get so into this show it's like don't bother me when I'm watching. I was really sorry when it was taken off of TV in the US. I should be receiving Season 6 soon and then I'll be looking for Season 7. I think it only goes to S8 or S9. But a really terrific fantastic show.
