219451,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6300215962,Acute Observer,"[2, 8]","HUD, 1963 filmIt starts with a truck on a blacktop county highway. A young man, Lon, looks for his Uncle Hud. There is trouble at the ranch, Hud&#8217;s advice is needed. [No seatbelts then.] A calf died in the night for an unknown reason. Hud knows how to keep the buzzards away! Should they call the Government veterinarian? We see Hud&#8217;s character. [Note the prices in the grocery store when silver coins were used.] The vet said it looks like foot and mouth disease, the worst disaster for a cattleman. Did it come from the twenty cattle bought from Mexico? [No inspection at the border?] Hud suggests selling the cows before they are condemned. An unprincipled man? Their white-faced Herefords are rounded up. Longhorn cattle are dying out. [Like small ranches?] In a movie theater people sing before the show. Hud and Mrs. Peterson walk into the restaurant, they talk to Grandpa Homer.Hud talks to the Alma, the housekeeper. She is good at things. They test for disease by injecting healthy cows and see if they become diseased. Lon was injured and needs rest. If their herd is condemned they will be busted. We see more of Hud&#8217;s character. Teenagers do the &#8220;Twist&#8221; dance at the rodeo. Men try to catch a pig; Hud wins. [A rodeo celebrates the skills needed in ranching.] Later they celebrate and watch women in a bar. This results in a fight. Later Hud talks to Lon. Hud doesn&#8217;t give a damn, he doesn&#8217;t care for people. This is not a good example for Lon. Hud saw a lawyer about taking over Grandad&#8217;s property. Hud discusses this with Grandad. Then he visits Alma and forces his attentions on her. But Lon comes to her rescue. The veterinarian brings bad new: all of the cattle must be destroyed now! Grandad doesn&#8217;t want to sell oil leases from his land.Caterpillar tractors plow deep trenches to hold the herd for burial. The cows are packed together for the slaughter. &#8220;Start shooting!&#8221; Then it is quiet. A truck sprays liquid on the corpses. Then bags of lime are spread over the carcasses. &#8220;It didn&#8217;t take long.&#8221; Next the caterpillar tractors spread dirt to bury the carcasses. Were any missed? Banning dismisses his ranch hands: no work. &#8220;This is the wort thing that has ever happened.&#8221; &#8220;Bury them quick!&#8221; Alma will also leave, Lon takes her to the bus stop. Hud tells her &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry&#8221;. When Lon drives home he sees Grandad in the road! He fell off his horse and couldn&#8217;t get back up. Is this the end! Hud tells Lon about the past. [Did this financial setback break Grandad&#8217;s will to live?] Lon decides to leave his home and go out on his own. Hud is left alone. [We just know Hud will somehow survive.]This seems like an overlong movie that describes life on a small cattle ranch in dry, dusty south Texas. How realistic is its portrayal of small-town life where none are involved in church activities? It has a taste for a decaying family, one with no friends and relatives of the Bannings. I never saw it when it came out in 1963 but heard about its controversial scenes. You won&#8217;t miss anything if you never watch it. It is not a documentary. How did cattle get across the border without inspection? Smuggling? Is there any value in watching a family farm go out of business?",1,Life on a Cattle Ranch,1390176000,"01 20, 2014",2014,3328,"['HUD', '1963', 'filmIt', 'truck', 'blacktop', 'county', 'highway', 'young', 'man', 'Lon', 'Uncle', 'Hud', 'trouble', 'ranch', 'Hud', '8217', 's', 'advice', 'needed', '[', 'seatbelts', 'then', ']', 'calf', 'died', 'night', 'unknown', 'reason', 'Hud', 'how', 'keep', 'buzzards', 'away', 'Should', 'call', 'Government', 'veterinarian', 'see', 'Hud', '8217', 's', 'character', '[', 'Note', 'prices', 'grocery', 'store', 'when', 'silver', 'coins', 'were', 'used', ']', 'vet', 'said', 'foot', 'mouth', 'disease', 'worst', 'disaster', 'cattleman', 'Did', 'come', 'twenty', 'cattle', 'bought', 'Mexico', 'inspection', 'border', ']', 'Hud', 'selling', 'cows', 'are', 'condemned', 'unprincipled', 'man', 'white-faced', 'Herefords', 'are', 'rounded', 'up', 'Longhorn', 'cattle', 'are', 'dying', 'out', '[', 'small', 'ranches', ']', 'movie', 'theater', 'people', 'sing', 'show', 'Hud', 'Mrs.', 'Peterson', 'walk', 'restaurant', 'talk', 'Grandpa', 'Homer.Hud', 'talks', 'Alma', 'housekeeper', 'good', 'things', 'test', 'disease', 'injecting', 'healthy', 'cows', 'see', 'become', 'diseased', 'Lon', 'was', 'injured', 'rest', 'herd', 'condemned', 'will', 'be', 'busted', 'see', 'more', 'Hud', '8217', 's', 'character', 'Teenagers', 'do', '8220', 'Twist', '8221', 'dance', 'rodeo', 'Men', 'try', 'catch', 'pig', 'Hud', '[', 'rodeo', 'skills', 'needed', 'ranching', ']', 'Later', 'celebrate', 'watch', 'women', 'bar', 'results', 'fight', 'Later', 'Hud', 'talks', 'Lon', 'Hud', 'doesn', '8217', 'give', 'damn', '8217', 'care', 'people', 'not', 'good', 'example', 'Lon', 'Hud', 'saw', 'lawyer', 'taking', 'over', 'Grandad', '8217', 's', 'property', 'Hud', 'Grandad', 'Then', 'Alma', 'attentions', 'Lon', 'rescue', 'veterinarian', 'brings', 'bad', 'new', 'cattle', 'must', 'be', 'destroyed', 'now', 'Grandad', 'doesn', '8217', 'want', 'sell', 'oil', 'leases', 'land.Caterpillar', 'tractors', 'plow', 'deep', 'trenches', 'hold', 'herd', 'burial', 'cows', 'are', 'packed', 'together', 'slaughter', '8220', 'Start', 'shooting', '8221', 'Then', 'quiet', 'truck', 'liquid', 'corpses', 'Then', 'bags', 'lime', 'are', 'spread', 'carcasses', '8220', '8217', 't', 'take', 'long.', '8221', 'caterpillar', 'tractors', 'spread', 'dirt', 'bury', 'carcasses', 'Were', 'missed', 'Banning', 'ranch', 'hands', 'work', '8220', 'wort', 'thing', 'ever', 'happened.', '8221', '8220', 'Bury', 'quick', '8221', 'Alma', 'will', 'also', 'leave', 'Lon', 'bus', 'stop', 'Hud', '8220', '8217', 'sorry', '8221', 'When', 'Lon', 'home', 'Grandad', 'road', 'fell', 'off', 'horse', 'couldn', '8217', 'get', 'back', 'up', 'end', 'Hud', 'Lon', 'past', '[', 'Did', 'financial', 'setback', 'break', 'Grandad', '8217', 'will', 'live', ']', 'Lon', 'leave', 'home', 'go', 'out', 'own', 'Hud', 'left', 'alone', 'just', 'know', 'Hud', 'will', 'somehow', 'survive', ']', 'overlong', 'movie', 'life', 'small', 'cattle', 'ranch', 'dry', 'dusty', 'south', 'Texas', 'How', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'small-town', 'life', 'where', 'none', 'are', 'involved', 'church', 'activities', 'taste', 'decaying', 'family', 'one', 'friends', 'relatives', 'Bannings', 'never', 'saw', 'when', 'came', 'out', '1963', 'heard', 'controversial', 'scenes', 'won', '8217', 'miss', 'anything', 'never', 'watch', 'not', 'documentary', 'How', 'did', 'cattle', 'get', 'border', 'inspection', 'Smuggling', 'there', 'value', 'watching', 'family', 'farm', 'go', 'business']",Hud VHS
219452,A20LY8E9NGYA4M,6300215962,Alejandro Cortes,"[2, 3]","Hud Bannon is rebel, arrogant, corky, stubborn, he is a bully, and he is always fighting with his father. Usually a character like this one would be the villain in a movie, so a great actor was required to portray the role of Hud Bannon, and that great actor is Paul Newman. Few actors could have portrayed such a difficult role, only actors like James Dean, Marlon Brando, Jack Nicholson, Robert De Niro and of course, Paul Newman, are capable of portray an antihero, and still are able of winning the sympathy of the audience. And Paul Newman was the right choice to play the role of Hud.This movie is carried by the performances, the direction and the story. Not only Paul Newman did a great job, the rest of the cast brought an excellent performance as well, actors like Melvyn Douglas as Homer (Hud's father), Patricia Neal as Alma (Hud's love interest) and Brandon de Wilde as Lon Bannon (Hud's nephew) were outstanding in ""Hud"".The music and the photography also contributed to make ""Hud"" a great movie, one of the most underrated classics.

219453,AGEIT17HENDIS,6300215962,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","The last time I have had a chance to mention the work of Larry McMurtry, whose novel this movie is adapted from, was a recent review of his The Last Picture Show trilogy (a must read, by the way) concerning the coming of age, mid-life crises and struggles with mortality of a cohort of small town Texas characters, especially one Duane Moore. As usual when I get `high' on an author I like to run through most of his or her work to see where he or she is going with it. Thus, this review of a lesser work turned into an exceptional film is something of an introduction to themes that McMurtry likes to give a work out in his literary efforts. Apparently, when it comes to bring to life the Texas of the 1950's and 1960's either cinematically or in book form your first (and maybe last stop, although I would give Horton Foote some play) is at Mr. McMurtry's doorstep.Okay, so what is the big deal? Take one young, world weary, cynical handsome and well-built ne'r-do-well 1950's cowboy Paul Newman, complete with Cadillac and cowboy hat (and an eye for the ladies, needless to say). Take one old-time rancher father of said Hud, Melvyn Douglas giving the performance of his life as a man out of step with the times as oil-rich Texas is passing him by. Take one sultry (yes, sultry in a country sort of way) substitute mother as the household cook and drudge. Add, for generational purposes, a young teenage grandson Brandon De Wilde the prototype for later characters that we shall see again in other Texas scenarios by McMurtry. Put them all together with all kinds of family, personal and social tensions and a ranch crisis brought on by an epidemic of cattle hoof and mouth disease. Film it in black and white (a natural medium for 1950's- 1960's modern cowboy movies-think the Misfits) and place it in small town Texas with all its pride, prejudices and customs. Then take a couple of hours to see how a well-written novel and a well-thought out film can mesh as one. This is the Texas of Larry's dreams and ours.

219456,A1NFKE0TNZUGGC,6300215962,"Benito Vasquez ""Benji""","[3, 3]","Not unlike many of my generation, I grew up thinking nothing could be better than ""Cool Hand Luke"" as far as Paul Newman movies go. I was wrong. With no disrespect to the fabulous ""Luke,"" Hud in all it's appropriate black and white glory surpasses the superb ""Luke"" in my book. Masterfully filmed and written, the direction and editing guide ""Hud"" at a perfect pace, contrasting between blatant and subtlety in revealing the defining attributes of the cast, foreshadowing the inevitable clashes to come between Melvyn Douglas' Homer Bannon character, his lone remaining son Hud (Newman), Lon, his grandson of his deceased other son, and Alma (Patricia Neal). The movie reveals the differences between its characters with a fine mix of dialogue and attitude that lesser movies require much more screen time to divulge. And what at the very beginning may seem puzzling as to why the charismatic Hud would be so loathed by his father while admired by so many others, becomes very understanding as the film unfolds. With fabulously written dialogue exchanges between the main characters, and tell tale scenes, despite the fact that there'll always be ladies who'd still adore a Hud type character (as well as men), it becomes apparent why the opposite too is easy to understand. Everyone knows a Hud. Everyone knows a person who they can say ""So in so"" is only looking out for ""So in so."" It's easy to see why the cinematography won an Oscar, as well as Douglas and Neal. This movie would not have had the same feel if filmed in color. This movie is a study in character, or lack thereof. A movie that makes one question those they admire and why, as well as one's own motives in their day to day actions. ""Cool Hand Luke"" left an impressionable mark on me in making me feel strongly for Newmans character. ""Hud"" did that too in a completely different way. The mark of great writing, directing and acting. One of my all time favorite films, and one of the first DVDs I bought. And it's a scrumptous black and white transfer on DVD.",5,Masterpiece!

219458,A25Q6YSL31AQM,6300215962,Bill Kelly,"[8, 8]","Here is a movie that looks like it was made yesterday. Paul Newman's character, Hud Bannon, is a spoiled-rotten, waste of a man. He is the personification of selfishness - booze, adultery, and various other sins are his way of life. He has even distanced himself from his aging father, Homer (Melvyn Douglas - Best Supporting Actor Oscar). Homer is a principled, upright rancher. When Homer faces a crisis, his relationship with Hud is put to the test. Homer turns to Hud for advice, and Hud responds, &quot;he didn't ask me about anything in fifteen years.&quot;Homer is familiar with Hud's persona.  Homer states &quot;you live just for yourself (Hud).&quot; Homer's housekeeper, divorcee Alma Brown (Patricia Neal, Best Supporting Actress Oscar), knows Hud's type of person, too.  After Hud makes advances on Alma, she tells him &quot;I done my time with one cold-blooded bastard. I'm not looking for another.&quot; The tie that binds the three of them happens to be Lon Bannon - Hud's nephew.  Lon idolizes Hud.  Homer is fearful of this and he doesn't want him to be like Hud.  Gradually, we come to find out toward the end of the film what has alienated Hud from his father, and vice versa.  In the end, Lon learns Hud's true identity after several more tragedies.Neal and Douglas are brilliant. James Wong Howe won Oscar for cinematography.  The film was also nominated for Best Actor (Newman), director (Martin Ritt), screenplay (Harriet Frank Jr. and Irving Ravetch), and Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Black-and-White (Robert R.

219459,A1DB4U8ISVULVE,6300215962,Bill Smith,"[1, 2]","Unfortunately, as is common in any open commercial site, the reviews of things like movies and books tend to sink down to the lowest common denominator of humankind, meaning one has to sift through a lot of sludge and gunk to get to anything meaningful. One of the biggest review failings for movies like this one is people who think that reviewing a movie means giving a PLOT SYNOPSIS, almost literally spitting out the movie script word for word. That is really laughable when the movie is 40-50 years old, like this one. See for example, the review below by ""An Acute Observer"" (oh, lord, the irony). Usually, the Amazon description has already given the basic movie plot or outline, so ANOTHER long detailed plot description is completely unnecessary. Second, for a movie like this there are most likely dozens of previous 'reviews' that have wasted our time with dumb plot summaries. Third, summarizing the plot is NOT a review of the movie. Its an attempt by a simpleton to act like you know what you are talking about when you really have no clue.Finally, when someone then, after giving a dumb meaningless plot summary, proceeds to call the movie a waste of time, obviously not even understanding the whole point of the movie, the exercise becomes laughably absurd. When one acutely does not understand the significance of the demise of a family ranch in the context of the vanishing west, when one acutely does not understand what the Hud character signifies in contrast to what his father signifies, when one acutely fails to grasp even the most obvious symbolism and REASONS for certain scenes being included, you wonder how such an obviously brain limited mammal ever lasted more than a few years existing on this planet. When that happens, you pretty much need to print out that person's review and use it as toilet paper. Unfortunately, Amazon does not delete reviews based on stupidity ratings.Suffice it to say, just ignore people who call themselves ""acute observers"". Hud is a classic gem, one of the last old westerns from a bygone era, and an introduction to the 'new' western. Pair it in a double bill with a classic similarly themed, black and white movie made at the end of the 60s for a cinematic expression of the death of the old west---The Last Picture Show. Newman should have won an Oscar for this one (and Cool Hand Luke, The Hustler etc). The movie perfectly captures a moment in time, and the end of an era, both literally and figuratively.

219460,A383Q6UK27585R,6300215962,"billy c bowden ""Jett""","[5, 6]","""Hud"" is a black and white ""western"" classic, a noir Texas Panhandle power play between a father and son in a world transitioning from quarter horses to convertible Cadillacs!..Hud Bannon, played irresistably by Paul Newman is the glib town hunk, elder son, that oozes rebel charm, and has an uncanny knack to run between raindrops without getting a spot of water on himself..The father, played stoically by Melvyn Douglas, prefers to ignore Hud's peccadilloes with the two-timing wives of the local oil field trash, except that it sets in his eyes, an unforgivable example for the baby brother Lon, played by Brandon Dewilde, the young boy from ""Shane"" fame..Lon hero-worships Hud, because Hud can handle himself with the ladies, the town bullies, and can rapid-fire zesty zingers on command to defuse a crisis, and when chooses to be is a most capable cowman..The plot revolves around a possible infestation of bangs, a communicable disease of cattle, that the father suspects has likely hit their herd..The father believes the right thing to do is call in the local G-man to test the cattle..However, Hud disagrees vehemently because there simply is no insurance for such a calamity, and would likely result in the quarantine and total loss of their herd..The familial clash pivots around the old world values of the father, who worries how it might affect the neigbors if undetected, and Hud's nihilistic belief that what the G-man don't know won't hurt him, but will ruin them..The father prevails and the net effect is, the herd must be slaughtered by rifle fire by the government..Hud then plots to have the father removed as executor of the family estate because he surmises the old man has gone totally soft in the head, weak-kneed..Patricia Neal plays Alma, the family housekeeper that undeniably has a sweet thing for Hud, and there is a cattle-car of sexual tension smoldering just below the surface between she and Hud, as evidenced by their feisty flirtations..Alma is the protypical head-strong pioneer woman, that is paradoxically vulnerable to the ""Peck's Bad Boy Ways"" and charisma of Hud..See ""Hud"", a movie borne out of the fertile imagination of Larry McMurtry, scripted from his novella ""Horseman Pass By""..The movie far exceeds the little read book, and is in many ways as an effective character study as anything Newman ever portrayed, including Tennessee William's ""Cat On A Hot Tin Roof""..Cowboy hats off to Martin Ritt, the director of this 60's Western oater, that captures without parallel the sense of time, place, and ethos of this stark period, to a West Texas T.",5,"Hud, The Real Boot Heel!",1134604800,"12 15,

Everything about it may be as good and marvellous as they say, but in the end it's an intensely depressing, misery-making, simply feel-bad kind of film. Acting, writing, shooting are all excellent: but the characters and the theme are either deeply unhappy or repellent. There was an aura of corrosive cynicism and disillusion about many movies of this era, starting perhaps with Look Back in Anger, and the British school of kitchen sink, moving West with a variety of American productions, including this one, of course. The obverse of this trend was the birth of Rock and Roll, which took place at about the same time. Perhaps both trends had the rejection of parental values in common, but, frankly, I prefer the Elvis sneer to Hud Bannon's  when it comes to offending the wrinkly and righteous. There is positively nothing appealing to me about Hud's personality: he's nothing but a good-looking, sulky, selfish, ill-mannered jerk.

Surely it can't be that bad.Well, ""Hud"" certainly makes it seem like it is.  This bleak and depressing story shows Hud (Paul Newman), only surviving son of a farm owner (Melvyn Douglas) who has found him to be nothing but a disappointment, selfishly whiling away the hours in Nowheresville, Texas.  Newman portrays Hud as almost ridiculously virile and full of annoying machismo.  His character doesn't know how to interact with anyone on a genuine level, so he instead uses aggression (physical, verbal, and sexual) as his only means of communication.  It's a great performance by Newman, but the character as written isn't fully fleshed out, and it's hard to ever feel anything but dislike for Hud.  Also great in the film is Patricia Neal, who dubiously won the Best Actress Academy Award for her performance as the live-in housekeeper who finds Hud obnoxious and alluring at the same time.  Her performance is obviously a supporting one and should in no way be considered a lead (though she really is the only female character in the movie), but she's great in it, and I only wish she was in the film more.Rounding out the cast of characters if Hud's nephew, son of his dead brother, played by Brandon de Wilde (of ""Shane"" fame), who's also very good.  Every actor has a natural style of delivery that makes this film seem so much more contemporary than other '63 releases.""Hud"" is an incredibly sombre film.

De Wilde idolizes his uncle Hud but is torn between the ideals expounded by his free living uncle and those of his straight laced grandfather.

219471,A315K47GRB024C,6300215962,Daniel C. Markel,"[0, 0]","This review is for the 2003 widescreen DVD release by Paramount.I've always been intrigued with movies about life in rural Texas.  The movie Hud features Paul Newman as Hud Bannon, a morally-bankrupt, hell-raising cowboy who lives with his father Homer (played by Melvyn Douglas) and Hud's nephew Lonnie on a large ranch in West Texas.  In addition, Patricia Neal plays the role of their cook and cleaning lady.  The storyline revolves around the wild life of Hud and how his lack of moral principals and irresponsible living soon puts a major strain on the entire household.  The plot is solidly melodramatic and the ending is somewhat subdued, but the acting is what makes movie extra special, especially the Oscar-winning performance by Melvyn Douglas.  The other thing that makes this movie so enjoyable are some great scenes shot in and around the nearby small rural Texas town.  The sing-along inside the movie theater is priceless.  All in all, Hud is a very well done movie, and if you like it, I'd also recommend viewing two similar, and in my opinion better movies, ""Giant"" and ""The Last Picture Show"".The DVD is in widescreen black and white.  The picture quality is near pristine with an occasional tiny dot of film deterioration showing up here and there during the movie, but nothing at all bothersome.  The audio and soundtrack are outstanding.  There are no bonus features on the DVD which is disappointing for a movie of this caliber.Movie: A-DVD Quality: A-",5,Great acting and a fascinating setting make this a special movie!,1122249600,"07 25, 2005",2005,1475,"['review', '2003', 'widescreen', 'DVD', 'release', 'Paramount.I', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'intrigued', 'movies', 'life', 'rural', 'Texas', 'movie', 'Hud', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'Hud', 'Bannon', 'morally-bankrupt', 'hell-raising', 'cowboy', 'who', 'father', 'Homer', 'played', 'Melvyn', 'Douglas', 'Hud', 'nephew', 'Lonnie', 'large', 'ranch', 'West', 'Texas', 'addition', 'Patricia', 'Neal', 'role', 'cook', 'cleaning', 'lady', 'storyline', 'revolves', 'wild', 'life', 'Hud', 'how', 'lack', 'moral', 'principals', 'irresponsible', 'living', 'soon', 'major', 'strain', 'entire', 'household', 'plot', 'solidly', 'melodramatic', 'ending', 'somewhat', 'subdued', 'acting', 'what', 'movie', 'extra', 'special', 'especially', 'Oscar-winning', 'performance', 'Melvyn', 'Douglas', 'other', 'thing', 'movie', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'are', 'great', 'scenes', 'shot', 'nearby', 'small', 'rural', 'Texas', 'town', 'sing-along', 'movie', 'theater', 'priceless', 'Hud', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'movie', 'like', ""'d"", 'also', 'recommend', 'viewing', 'two', 'similar', 'opinion', 'better', 'movies', 'Giant', 'Last', 'Picture', 'Show', '.The', 'DVD', 'widescreen', 'black', 'white', 'picture', 'quality', 'near', 'pristine', 'occasional', 'tiny', 'dot', 'film', 'deterioration', 'showing', 'up', 'here', 'there', 'movie', 'nothing', 'bothersome', 'audio', 'soundtrack', 'are', 'outstanding', 'are', 'bonus', 'DVD', 'disappointing', 'movie', 'caliber.Movie', 'A-DVD', 'Quality', 'A-']",Hud VHS
219472,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,6300215962,David Baldwin,"[2, 2]","The most telling line in ""Hud"" is when Hud Bannon (Paul Newman) tells his father, Homer Bannon(Melvyn Douglas), that he had to be bad because his father was so good.  Therein lies the paradox of ""Hud"".  Do we empathize with the morally flawed Hud or with the overly pious Homer?  Or do we just stand back and pity this unfortunate father-son relationship?  Credit these two superb actors for creating complex characters that offer the audience no easy answers.  Also excellent is Brandon De Wilde as Hud's nephew Lonnie who is drawn into a tug-of-war for his soul by these two polar opposites.  Patricia Neal as the frank talking housekeeper, Alma, steals virtually scene she is in.  The conflict she has is that she is simultaneously repulsed and aroused by the lecherous Hud.  The scenes she shares with Newman have a certain erotic charge to them.  Neal won the Oscar for best actress in 1963 for her role here.  There's no debating how good she is but her role is most certainly a supporting one.  Gorgeous black-and-white cinematography by James Wong Howe.  It's best utilized in the film's chilling cattle slaughter scene.  The final shot of the film with Hud at the porch door perfectly encapsulates the film.  It's ambiguous but it's in synch with the rest of the movie.",5,"""My Mother Loved Me""",1183420800,"07 3, 2007",2007,1278,"['most', 'telling', 'line', 'Hud', 'when', 'Hud', 'Bannon', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'father', 'Homer', 'Bannon', 'Melvyn', 'Douglas', 'had', 'be', 'bad', 'father', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'Therein', 'paradox', 'Hud', 'Do', 'empathize', 'morally', 'flawed', 'Hud', 'overly', 'pious', 'Homer', 'do', 'just', 'stand', 'back', 'pity', 'unfortunate', 'father-son', 'relationship', 'Credit', 'two', 'superb', 'actors', 'creating', 'complex', 'characters', 'offer', 'audience', 'easy', 'answers', 'Also', 'excellent', 'Brandon', 'De', 'Wilde', 'Hud', 'nephew', 'Lonnie', 'who', 'drawn', 'tug-of-war', 'soul', 'two', 'polar', 'opposites', 'Patricia', 'Neal', 'frank', 'talking', 'housekeeper', 'Alma', 'virtually', 'scene', 'conflict', 'simultaneously', 'repulsed', 'aroused', 'lecherous', 'Hud', 'scenes', 'shares', 'Newman', 'have', 'certain', 'erotic', 'charge', 'Neal', 'won', 'Oscar', 'best', 'actress', '1963', 'role', 'here', 'debating', 'how', 'good', 'role', 'most', 'certainly', 'supporting', 'one', 'Gorgeous', 'black-and-white', 'cinematography', 'James', 'Wong', 'Howe', 'best', 'utilized', 'film', 'chilling', 'cattle', 'slaughter', 'scene', 'final', 'shot', 'film', 'Hud', 'porch', 'door', 'perfectly', 'film', 'ambiguous', 'synch', 'rest', 'movie']",Hud VHS

219477,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6300215962,Ed Uyeshima,"[3, 3]","Director Martin Ritt collaborated with his regular writing team of Irving Ravetch and Harriet Frank, Jr., to come up with this low-key 1963 contemporary western classic, but the sun-baked Texas locations are almost subsidiary to the Shakespearean-level human drama played out here. Based on Larry McMurtry's first novel, ""Horseman, Pass By"", the plot focuses on the dysfunctional Bannon family, whose cattle have been infected by foot-and-mouth disease. This devastating news puts the ranch in jeopardy as patriarch Homer may have to destroy his entire herd.Surviving son Hud wants to pass off the contaminated cattle to unsuspecting buyers to avoid economic ruin, but Homer is too honest to consider such an option. Meanwhile, teenaged grandson Lonnie idolizes his womanizing uncle Hud to the point of getting drunk with him and participating in a bar fight. Silently attracted to Hud herself, their world-weary housekeeper Alma finds she needs to keep emotionally distant just to avoid the family maelstrom about to occur. However, the inevitable collisions among the four characters play themselves out in unexpected ways.A quartet of fine actors exhibits their skills beautifully in the movie. In what has to be the most unsympathetic role he has played in his career, Paul Newman gives a brutally uncompromising performance as Hud. At this point of his career, he could have played it safe since he has the looks and charisma to make his character's popularity understandable. However, he takes risks in getting to the essence of the amoral lout behind the bravado. Melvyn Douglas lends an epic gravity to Homer by infusing dramatic economy to his penetrating performance. As Alma, Patricia Neal superbly etches a realistic portrait of a lonely woman on the verge with just a few scenes, and she makes every moment of her screen time count.A decade after making a vivid impression as little Joey Starrett in George Stevens' masterpiece, ""Shane"", Brandon De Wilde intriguingly plays almost a post-adolescent variation as Lonnie, but this time, he plays it with even greater depth as his character begins to realize the type of man his uncle really is. Along with 1972's ""Sounder"", this is likely the apex of Ritt's work as a director as he gets to the heart of McMurtry's story with a minimum of flourish, for example, his sharply effective handling of the movie's searing climactic scenes both in the open pit and in Alma's room. Elmer Bernstein's evocative music and James Wong Howe's striking black-and-white cinematography contribute immeasurably to the film's success. A winner albeit a downbeat one.

Though a tale of morality, &quot;Hud&quot; is at its core a eulogy to a bygone era of America's past, and devastating portrait of modern degeneration. The performances are nothing less than fantastic as the characters presented in &quot;Hud&quot; are all so well realized that their presences will haunt the viewer long after the screen fades to black. Paul Newman is at his best as the despicable title character, while Patricia Neal gives her most legendary performance as a rangy housekeeper. Equally brilliant are Melvyn Douglas whose character functions as the film's moral center, and the young Brandon de Wilde whose character serves as the innocent spectator to the story's tragedy.Though the deserved winner of several Academy Awards, &quot;Hud&quot; has become somewhat of a forgotten masterpiece.

219479,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,6300215962,"""flickjunkie""","[8, 8]","This is among my favorite Paul Newman films.  Newman plays Hud Bannon, a roguish son of a respectable rancher who spends most of his time drinking and womanizing.  He is idolized by his nephew Lonnie (Brandon De Wilde) who is always trying to tag along so he can become just like Hud.When a cow on the ranch comes down with hoof and mouth disease, Hud tries to get his aging father (Melvyn Douglas) declared incompetent so he can take over the ranch.  This is a brilliant character study of an unrepentant and self-centered scoundrel and the people he uses people to fulfill his own wicked desires.  Director Martin Ritt (""Norma Rae"", ""Murphy's Romance"") takes a well-crafted screenplay and delivers a powerful presentation that never drags despite its depth.  He brings us a subtle struggle between good and evil, pitting the saintly father against the malevolent son with the soul of young Lon hanging in the balance.  The fact that Hud is such a charismatic character makes his nefarious nature both seductive and despicable, leaving the viewer hoping he will learn his lesson and reform.  This takes the story one step beyond the standard white hat versus black hat Western.The most important part of any character study is the acting.  In this film, the acting is superb.  Newman brings a forceful haughtiness to the screen along with a heart of granite.  He was nominated for an Oscar for best actor, but was beaten by an electrifying performance by Sidney Poitier in ""Lilies of the Field"".  Patricia Neal is earthy and tough as the live-in domestic, a role that earned her the Oscar for best actress.  The sexual tension between her and Newman sizzles.  Melvyn Douglas also won an Oscar for best supporting actor.  He endowed Homer Bannon with a noble character and high integrity, an archetype of good that served as a perfect contrast to Hud's immorality.  Brandon De Wilde is best known for his role as Joey in ""Shane"", but I believe this is his best performance.  As he did in ""Shane"", he plays a young man idolizing another only to be disappointed in the end.  This mature performance might have helped De Wilde bridge the gap between precocious child star and the adult roles for which he longed.  Unfortunately, he had a promising career cut short by his tragic death in an auto accident at age 30.This film is a powerful look at the human condition at its best and its worst.

He's one of those me, me, me people who's only true love is himself. We've all known them. Oh, Hud would be fun to know and to hang out with for a few laughs, but deep down he's a self-centered scumbag who will do in even those closest to him if it suits his own interests.

219482,A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4,6300215962,Gerard D. Launay,"[1, 1]","This is a unique Western for so many reasons.  It's not so much about the old West as about the end of the old West.  It has very few scenes of action.  It's not about train bandits or Indian killers or saloon card games.  It's about values - the values that built America and the values that will tear it apart. And for that reason, I think it is the one of the five best Westerns ever filmed. (The other four are Lonely are the Brave, The Wild Bunch, The Ox Bow Incident, and The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance)Different people react to different lines of the film...the movie is so well written. The line I remember best is that ""America changes based upon the men we value.""  In our American politics, all of us have seen the significance in the type of Presidents selected to lead the country.This film is more like a play, a Greek tragedy, of the rift between father and son.  The father - a cowboy of the old sort -  believes in the land,  believes in personal freedom,  believes in the importance of reputation, and believes in himself.  The son - a cowboy of the new sort - believes in nothing - or at minimum, just in looking after himself.The total lack of morals of the son named Hud (performed brilliantly by Paul Newman) tears apart everything that the father has built on the ranch.  In the end, the father prefers to die.  Yes, the son has obtained control of the ranch in this way...but it seems an empty gain.So much of the film is figurative and metaphorical. This gives the movie such richness and depth.  I was amazed how compelling the story was with so little action.  You might say this is a thinking man's Western.  Indeed the violence of Hud is always misplaced...and somewhat distasteful.  Contrast that with the typical Western or Science Fiction film which (impliedly) praises the violent hero who wipes out his enemy with a gun.Indeed, when certain violent scenes are restrained, the film gains additional power. There is a moment where the ranchers have to kill 100 herd of cows who have contracted hoof and mouth disease.  In detail, the modern film would depict the blood and gore and suffering of the animals. But that's unnecessary. The death of the animals is more meaningful by showing the shooting, then the burial of these animals.""Hud"", the film, is simply superb.

219484,A7Y6AVS576M03,6300215962,gobirds2,"[3, 3]","What hits you first in this film? For me it was the images. There are black-and-white images of rural Texas and cars. We are definitely in a Western setting but it is also definitely contemporary. One way of life is transitioning into a new one. The visual imagery is vividly captured by cinematographer James Wong Howe's always intuitive and brilliant work. One way of life, that of living a moral lifestyle through hard physical work of the land, gives way to cynical, lethargic and calculating modernism. The film focuses on the Bannon family. There is Melvyn Douglas who plays Homer Bannon, the highly moral patriarch who never has really lived life but instead works it. Paul Newman is HUD, Hud Bannon, Homer's son. Hud stands for everything counter to his father. Hud lives a questionably moral or just an outright immoral (as seen by his father) lifestyle that is certainly worldly by anyone's standards yet he will always come back to his father's call no matter how much of a cad Newman's character appears to be. Brandon de Wilde is Lon Bannon, Hud's impressionable nephew and it is through his perspective we see things.  Patricia Neal is the housekeeper Alma whose worldly ambitions come into play with her banter with Hud and interestingly she never gives in to Paul Newman's constant allusive advances. The clash of cultural and moral ideology, of the old ways vs. the new, comes over the Bannon's herd of cattle almost assuredly infected with hoof-and-mouth disease.  Douglas wants the cattle slaughtered while Newman wants to sell them off and not take the monetary loss.

Enough praise can't be given to each actor for their work here, although Paul Newman must be singled out.  This is as good as he gets, and that says a lot.  There's not much in Hud's character to admire, but in some ways, the viewer does.  He's dangerous and doesn't pretend to be anything else.  He lives for himself, and makes no apologies.

219490,A26KUECUNU825F,6300215962,jcd,"[4, 12]","There are two things that stop ""Hud"" from being a truly great movie: Newman's very good but not quite good enough performance, and an often strong but fatally flawed script.First the script, which by the way adapts a Larry McMurtry novel. For me, the movie slipped away in the big confrontation scene between Hud and his father after Hud has brought his nephew home drunk. It violates the most basic rule of good writing, especially film and theater writing: Show it, don't tell it. That's a shame, because there's a lot wonderful about this film, but in that jaw-droppingly contrived passage of dialogue, where the writer just steps into the film and sticks a tiresome detailing of the film's theme and (wince) moral into his poor characters' mouths, all the grit, sweat and drama drain right out of the movie. (And this is the worst but not the last such moment.) It's like the movie in its first hour had launched itself daringly into the '60s...and then suddenly collapsed back into '30s Warners melodrama. Too bad.And then there's Newman. He's very good, for sure, and the fact that his performance doesn't quite get there may finally be mostly matters of script and direction. But in fact he's not as good as either Melvyn Douglas, as Hud's old-school father, or, especially, Patricia Neal, as the hard-bitten cook and housekeeper warily weighing Hud's charms. Newman doesn't quite get inside Hud's skin--his performance is a bit too from the outside in. And he doesn't finally show us enough of what makes the character tick, or make him more than a selfish, cynical (if charming) cypher.Yes, there's a lot good here: the stark B&W; cinematography that uses the wide screen so well; the remarkable above-noted performances; the prescient story that contrasts not only an old and new West but an old and new American capitalism.

The film is a masterpiece on every level, from Martin Ritt's unobtrusive direction, to James Wong Howe's magnificently arid black-and-white cinematography, to the multi-layered moral complexities inside the deceptively simple narrative, to Patricia Neal's moving portrayal of a woman who would rather start over with nothing than deal with the unwanted advances of an egotistical lout.This was the first film in what can be referred to as Newman's '4H Antihero Quartet,' to be followed by ""Harper"" in 1966 and ""Cool Hand Luke"" and ""Hombre"" in 1967.

It is a western allegory, to be certain, with Paul Newman's antihero acting as foil to his high morality father and betwixt and between nephew, who admires both but doesn't know which way to go.In the end, the antihero outlasts his old man, gets his ranch, sells it off for the oil that bubbles beneath the surface, and goes on his merry way, with no regard for anyone lese. The good guy is dead, the bad guy wins, and the viewer is left with an emptiness because the morality tale is not reconciled properly. It is this final comment -- evil wins -- that makes this one of the greatest films of its type.Along with ""Cool Hand Luke"", this role has been the plum of Paul Newman's still ongoing career. Newman scored as a another bad boy against his real-life wife in another flick but never played the bad boy as well as in this movie. Melvyn Douglas, whose screen presence was never less than magnificent, was outstanding as his father and the keeper of all goodwill.The conflict between titans on opposite sides of the morality spectrum is what sustains the tension throughout this epic and still modern film. Had either of the characters been less real, less of a leonine figure, this movie would easily have wallowed in mediocrity.As it is, ""Hud"" is a singular figure in movie history -- the modern cowboy that goes bad, defeats the moralist, and gets his reward in the end. What makes it such a tresurable experience is its grounding in reality, not fantasy. In the fantasy world of Hollywood, the good guy in the white hat usually wins.This time, the bad guy wore a white hat, drank too much, cheated with married women, tried to rape the cook and forced her to leave, undercut his dad at every turn, aged him beyond his years, portrayed a miserable role model for a younger relative, and got everything.

Based on an early novel of Larry McMurtry's, the landscape of a cattle ranch and dusty Texas town is familiar. Filmed in black and white, the cinematography won an academy award as did the performance of Melvyn Douglas as the aging patriarch whose strong moral values are in constant conflict with his son Hud, a hard-drinking, selfish anti-hero, played by Paul Newman. Brandon DeWilde is the teenager on the brink of manhood who has both of these men as role models. And Patricia Neal, who also won an academy award for her performance, is cast as the housekeeper, whose hard-edged sensuality keeps the sexual tension high.There's trouble at the ranch; the cattle seemed to have hoof and mouth disease. Everything the old man has worked for all his life is likely to be destroyed. Hud is mean and petty. He'd be willing to sell the diseased cattle, just as he'd be willing to have his own father declared incompetent so he could take over the ranch. He's unlikable with not one single redeeming value. But he sure is sexy. My personal favorite lines occur between him and Patricia Neal. She's talking about her ex-husband and says that the only thing the ex-husband was good for was scratching her back in places she couldn't reach. Paul Newman gives her a smoldering look and says, &quot;Well, let me know if you ever get an itch.&quot;I enjoyed the film, especially the acting. Towards the end I found myself getting a little restless because by then I anticipated the ending. But the story and the acting and the wonderful setting made up for all of that.

Lawrence of Arabia, Return of the King and The Sound of Music win Best Picture and Best Director BUT NONE FOR THE ACTING???2. In 1943, Ingrid Bergman gets nominated for Leading Actress for For Whom the Bell Tolls instead of CASABLANCA???The same could be said of Martin Ritt's Hud. I watched it two days ago, then looked up how many trophies it won and was nominated for. HOW THE HECK can a movie receive nominations for Best Director, Leading Actor, Leading Actress, Supporting Actor and Screenplay (Five of the most CRUCIAL awards) but NOT BEST PICTURE??? How asinine is that? Since when is a movie's greatness NOT judged by the acting, direction and script? Were the judges drinking the Jim Jones cool-aid in 1963? I just don't get it.Hud is definitely not a feel-good movie and I won't promise you, you won't need the tissues every now and then but what makes it a great movie is that it is so brutally honest about the pathetic nature of a libertine and how important it is to be very careful of the kind of men you admire.The movie follows the lives of two allegorical figures--Homer and his son Hud. The father represents the old morality culture: being honest in your dealings, taking care of your family, being principled and accepting the bad times as well as the good. The son represents the trendy, new, emerging, Hedonistic, ME! ME! ME! Culture that promotes indulging your appetites and who gives a  @#!*%  who gets hurt? The question at the end is ""Which one are you?""Hud is mean, rude, smart-alleck and loves to drink and fool around with married women. He constantly clashes with his father and can't wait to get his claws on the ranch. Finally, Homer dies of a heart attack saying ""I can't wait to get out of here. Hud's been waiting for this day and he ain't a patient man."" and Hud inherits but he is all alone. His housekeeper and nephew Alma and Lonnie, who live with him, fly the coop because they cannot tolerate his moral rottenness. Like Citizen Kane, he finally gets his wish--all the money and land in the world--but no friends or family, no one who loved him, no one who really cared about him.Patricia Neal gives a magnificent performance as Alma, the world-weary housekeeper with a heart of gold. She is kind, gentle and down to earth but still has just the right amount of backbone to tell it like is and not let anyone push her around. The things she does with her eyes are amazing. I love the mischievous grin on her face when Hud has humored her by saying ""If you ever get that itch on your back again just let me know so I can scratch it for you."" Even though she knows he's a scumbag, she still finds something alluring about him that attracts her. But then BOOM! Her reality check comes in and crashes her silly fantasy dream world when Lonnie saves her hide from a drunken pass Hud make at her in her room. That look on her face when she's on the floor after Lonnie stops him in the nick of time--the sheer TERROR in her glittering eyes--will NEVER leave my mind. EVER. I was so choked up when she hugs Lonnie goodbye the next day. She loves him and the old man way down to the bottom of her heart because they are like family to her. She hates to leave but knows in her heart, she has no choice and all because of Hud's shenanigans. I've never had the sense she was supporting and I've no idea why so many people on the Internet Movie Database and Unofficial Academy Awards Discussion Board seem convinced that it is. The script centers in on a quartet: Hud, Lonnie, Homer and Alma and gives them equal amount of character development and screen time. Remember, sometimes you can have MORE than one main character.Melvyn Douglas is superb as the grouchy old man, Homer who tells it like it is. He should have been nominated for Leading Actor instead but that's Hollywood for you. He has one of the most powerful, thought-provoking lines that apply very well to celebrities, stars and politicians. ""Little by little the look of the country changes because of the men we admire."" What I love best about his performance is that even though he is the `good guy' he doesn't sanctify his character. He can be stubborn and ornery but he admits that he has his faults just like anyone else. ""Maybe I was too hard on him. I don't know. Old people sometimes get as hard as their arteries.""Paul Newman is amazing as the rebellious, strong-willed, bad-natured Hud. The things he does with his bleary eyes and smirky smile are so creepy. The only reason I don't award him Best Leading Actor is because I split the vote between him and Douglas for Sidney Poitier in Lilies of the Field.The only weak member of the cast is Brandon deWilde as Lonnie as he just stands around with these deadpan, blank expressions all the time and says his lines in a monotone. But with the splendid characterizations of Newman, Douglas and Neal, who cares?Martin Ritt's direction is superb and allows the actors plenty of leash to show off their abilities. The vast desert cinematography is superb. The wind constantly howling in the quiet scenes perfectly suits the bleakness of the plot. Elmer Bernstein's guitar score is simple but hauntingly beautiful.The only quibble I have is at the beginning, one of the characters say Hud's convertible is pink. There is just NO WAY a tough, macho man like him (it's Paul Newman for PETE'S SAKE!) would have a car THAT color. The screenwriter should have referred to the car as `blue' `red' or `green.'If you're looking for entertainment don't watch Hud but if your looking for a great movie that studies the philosophies of hard work and Hedonism and don't mind the absence of a final note of hope and redemption look no further than Hud.",5,"`Little by little, the look of the country changes because of the men we

The grandfather and uncle are having an emotional war during the entire film. Their maid, played by Patricia Neal, is desired by both Hud and the young man. Neal won Best Actress in this role which I felt was overly generous (as she did a supporting role at best) so maybe it was for another role that she lost to at an earlier date.HUD received seven AA nominations and also won Best Black and White Cinematography. As you can tell this is an old movie that came out in 1963 and is probably best suited for classic film buff fans like myself. It's an intensive character study that did very well at the Box Office (Paul Newman was something of the Brad Pitt back in the day). All said, the persona Newman took on reminded me of other movies he did back in the day which I found more enjoyable. Two of them being CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF and the soapy FROM THE TERRACE. While this was marketed as a Western (because Westerns did well back then) it's much more of a family in turmoil who happen to be ranchers.

Alma is flattered by his attention but when he tries to force himself on her during a drunken rage, this starts the end to spiral forward.This was the first movie based on a Larry McMurtry book.  As with the latter adaptation of his works (The Last Picture Show, Lonesome Dove and most recently Brokeback Mountain), this is a story about people who are coping with the desperation of isolation in the West.This was also an early film by Martin Ritt.  Ritt was always interested in complex family relationships in desperate times.  He would follow this film ten years later with the brilliant Sounder, which is about a southern black family trying to cope with 60's south and fifteen years later with equally brilliant Norma Rae, which is about a family being torn apart by the oppressive conditions of a mill town.This film proved Paul Newman's depth and potential as an actor.  Patricia Neal won the Oscar for her textured performance as did Melvyn Douglas.DVD EXTRAS: None",5,The Quiet Desperation of Small Cattle Town Life,1153180800,"07 18, 2006",2006,1732,"['Hud', 'Bannon', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'father', 'Melvyn', 'Douglas', 'ranch', 'impressionable', 'nephew', 'Brandon', 'de', 'Wilde', 'three', 'men', 'are', 'taken', 'care', 'shopworn', 'still', 'sexy', 'Alma', 'Patricia', 'Neal', 'Hud', 'favorite', 'past', 'time', '\\is', 'having', 'affairs', 'married', 'women', 'morals', 'constantly', 'Hud', 'father', 'other', 'hand', 'too', 'many', 'morals', 'point', 'when', 'find', 'dead', 'cow', 'Hud', 'let', 'buzzards', 'have', 'father', 'call', 'authorities', 'determine', 'what', 'killed', 'cow.What', 'do', ""n't"", 'suspect', 'could', 'be', 'foot', 'mouth', 'work', 'lives', 'limbo', 'divergent', 'personal', 'lives', 'unforeseen', 'consequence', 'Hud', 'turning', 'interest', 'Alma', 'Alma', 'flattered', 'attention', 'when', 'force', 'drunken', 'rage', 'end', 'spiral', 'forward.This', 'was', 'first', 'movie', 'based', 'Larry', 'McMurtry', 'book', 'latter', 'adaptation', 'works', 'Last', 'Picture', 'Show', 'Lonesome', 'Dove', 'most', 'recently', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'story', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'coping', 'desperation', 'isolation', 'West.This', 'was', 'also', 'early', 'film', 'Martin', 'Ritt', 'Ritt', 'was', 'always', 'interested', 'complex', 'family', 'relationships', 'desperate', 'times', 'would', 'follow', 'film', 'ten', 'years', 'later', 'brilliant', 'Sounder', 'southern', 'black', 'family', 'trying', 'cope', '60', 'south', 'fifteen', 'years', 'later', 'equally', 'brilliant', 'Norma', 'Rae', 'family', 'being', 'torn', 'apart', 'oppressive', 'conditions', 'mill', 'town.This', 'film', 'proved', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'depth', 'potential', 'actor', 'Patricia', 'Neal', 'won', 'Oscar', 'textured', 'performance', 'did', 'Melvyn', 'Douglas.DVD', 'EXTRAS', 'None']",Hud VHS

Determined to take over his father?s prosperous farm, Hud bides his time with sexual conquests and playing big brother to Lonnie (Brandon DeWilde). Lonnie worships Hud as a god, a rabid fascination that will be irreversible shattered when Hud attempts to rape the ranch?s cook and housemaid, Alma Brown (Patricia Neal). However, before the disillusionment comes the spoils. The family partake in a county fair in which Hud wins the ?greased pig? contest. He and Lonnie start a victory fight inside a barroom. Hud takes Alma to the movies. There?s really nothing extraordinary about the film, and yet it captures, perhaps better than most, the raw emotion of a powerful slice of Americana in the mid-west. However, as the story drags on the tide begins to turn away from Hud?s favor. Homer becomes ill and unable to tend the far. The cattle contract an infection, forcing the farm hands to exterminate the entire herd. Alma, realizing that Hud is incapable of any sort of compassion or tenderness, abandons him and the farm in search of a new life somewhere else.The transfer is a bit disappointing. Though the picture is free of many age related artifacts and digital artifacts, the overall presentation is somewhat soft, with blooming around the edges that renders parts of the B&W; picture in various rainbow hues - even with the color on one's television set turned to zero. Also edge enhancement is sometimes obvious. Finally, the overall presentation tends to be just a little too soft for the vintage of the camera negative. Close ups and medium shots look fairly sharp but long shots become a blurry mess. The gray scale is reasonably balanced, though during scenes shot at night, fine detail tends to get lost in the shadows. The audio is remastered and well balanced.

Point is, Neal's Oscar-winning performance should be appreciated at the same level as Newman's work (and for my money he over-acts just a tad).Paul battles with (Oscar-winning) Melvyn Douglas over the future of the ranch - dealing with cattle cannot sustain, especially at the prospect of drilling for oil.

From Brick Pollitt (Cat on a Hot Tin Roof) to Frank Galvin (The Verdict).  Early on, however, one of his most endurable graces the epic HUD, that of Hud Bannon.Hud is your atypical good ol' boy.  Spending his evenings getting drunk (and in the company of others wives) adn his days in conflict with his ranch owner father (the iconic Melvyn Douglas), who yearns for the past.  Also in the mix is Hud's young nephew, played by the late Brandon DeWilde (ironically the youngest cast member and the first to die back in 1972) who deeply admires Hud in a naive way, but whose opinion and maturity evolve thoroughout the film.Patricia Neal is the attractive housekeeper who does her best to hold this dysfunctional group together. Throughout the film, Newman flirts occasionally with Neal and this culminates in his chilling attempted rape towards films end.  It is at that point that Hud begins to fall apart.  In the end, Hud is left alone to ponder all that he did or did not do.You best watch the film to find the parts I did not fill you in on, that is the fun of it.The black and white transfer in letterbox is phenomenal.  Watch it on a big screen and you can almost picture yourself traveling down Texas roads.Warning:  There is a chilling scene involving the mass shooting of cattle.

I suppose a good place to start is to note the excellent adaptation of Larry McMurtry's early (""Lonesome Dove"") work. Count on dead-on insights into the lifestyle of the American cowboy. Add the steady guidance of one time Hollywood blacklisted Martin Ritt, who's work resume' is testament to excellence as one of our finest directors. Choosing black and white photography is always a risk in this modern era of filmmaking but was surely the right choice here. Then there is the cast. Oh what a cast. Melvyn Douglas (Homer Bannon) the tired, honest, heartbroken rancher who long ago accepted a painful reality that despite his best efforts as a father, he sired a worthless son in Hud. Patricia Neal effortlessly defined Alma, the average looking, earthy and durable domestic, a simple housekeeper who could with a subtle unconscious gesture, make lemonade all the sweeter by just handing it to you. Her deferred sexuality was well grounded in a gritty personal reality, her innate pragmatism served as protection from the not all together unwelcomed advances of opportunistic men. Finally, there is Hud masterfully portrayed by Paul Newman. Rotten to the core. Hud saw the world and all who inhabited it as flawed and corrupted. So everything and everybody in it was fair game in his selfish, destructive pursuit of self-gratification. For a time, his nephew Lon, somewhat stiffly played by Brandon De Wilde was utterly facinated by his pleasure seeking uncle. Homer, ever mindful of his son's corrupting ways gently guides his grandson by way of word and example down a more honorable and steady path to self-realization. Homer however, is faced with the loss of his cattle ranch by the discovery of hoof-and-mouth disease and is constantly challenged by Hud who shamelessly seeks to take control. The movie ends as realistically as it begins. No Hollywood contrivance here. In fact, one could argue that the ending made the film ripe for a sequel.

219524,AGZVS6M8XJGN6,6300215962,"Roberto Frangie ""Robert""","[8, 10]","The title character, a cattleman in contemporary Texas, is the quintessence of Newman's amoral, opportunistic loners: he's arrogant, seething with ambition, incapable of much warmth or affection... He quarrels, drinks heavily, takes women with crude assurance (""The only question I ever ask any woman is 'What time is your husband coming home?' ""), and doesn't give a damn about anyone except himself...Newman brings his familiar characteristics to perfection: the cynical, cold in manner; the nasty, contemptuous voice; the sly, insinuating smile... He's a model of casual defiance and detachment, as he drinks a pint of bourbon or stands insolently, hands on hips, hat down low over his forehead, or roars through the dusty town in his convertible Cadillac, making business deals or picking up loose women...Hud resembles Ben Quick, which isn't surprising, since director Martin Ritt and writers Irving Ravetch and Harriet Frank Jr. also did ""The Long, Hot Summer."" Like Quick, he is considerably sexy and charming, which attracts women and drinking buddies... He's the best example of Newman's idea of the glamorous, captivating, virile, but essentially rotten men we mistakenly admire; according to Newman, the film is meant to expose his underlying corruption...The drama revolves around the discovery of Hud's amorality by Lon (Brandon de Wilde), his seventeen-year-o1d nephew... Lon admires his uncle, but is ultimately torn between Hud's hedonism and the high moral principles of Hud's father, aging Homer Bannon (Melvyn Douglas).When Homer's cattle become diseased, Hud wants to sell them quickly, but Homer refuses to spread an epidemic, and has them destroyed... Hud really becomes despicable as he tries to have his father certified incompetent, so that he can take over the ranch... Like Chance Wayne (""Sweet Bird of Youth""), he's afraid of ending up in poverty: ""You don't look out for yourself, the only helping hand you'll ever get is when they lower the box.""Whereas Quick turned out to be a good guy after all, and Fast Eddie and Chance matured through pain and punishment, Hud is untouched and unregenerate to the very end... Refusing to accept his guilt, he says he's only as corrupt as everyone else; before he goes into the house, he angrily yells, ""The world's so full of crap a man's going to get into it sooner or later, whether he's careful or not. ""Many people considered Hud a hero... But this is natural, since the film is actually filled with compromises... For instance, Homer, the representative of goodness, is self-righteous, inflexible, full of solemn, pious platitudes, and generally unappealing, while Hud is vital, life-affirming and humorous... Furthermore, Homer's contempt for Hud, which he justifies by Hud's having never given a damn, seems unfair... Apparently he soured on Hud when the latter was in his teens, and thus the boy was denied love when he most needed it... This again brings up the father-son alienation theme, and it makes us sympathetic toward Hud...Even in his relations with others, Hud is not entirely despicable... He displays some tenderness toward Lon, especially in the scene in which they get drunk together... There's a touching moment as Hud says, somewhat sadly, ""Get all the good you can out of seventeen, because it sure wears out in one hell of a hurry."" In his cynical conversations with Alma, he has Quick's insolent sexual confidence, but Alma is experienced, earthy and just as cynical, and she even seems to encourage his sly innuendos, making it a match of equals rather than a one-sided sexual pursuit...Finally, how does an actor play a man whose overpowering charm attracts people, without attracting the audience as well? Of course this is a problem inherent in all of Newman's sexy villains, but at least with Quick and Eddie the charming traits prepare us for their reformations, while with Hud they work against the concept of his worthlessness... At this stage in his career, Newman was so appealing that it was hard to consider him as completely rotten...""Hud"" was nominated for seven Oscars... Awards went to Neal, Douglas and cinematographer James Wong Howe... Newman, up for his third Oscar, said, ""I'd like to see Sidney Poitier get it.

The protagonist (Hud, played by the immortal Paul Newman) is neither good nor kind.  To the contrary, he is a scoundrel with a troubled, guilt-ridden past who knows how to raise hell and does.  In an unforgettable performance, Paul Newman portrays the despicable Hud Bannon.  As a counter-point, his father (Melvyn Douglas) denies Hud his love and respect out of disgust and self-righteousness, in a classic father-son conflict.  Patricia O'Neil is magnificent as the tired, but still desirable housekeeper who tries to hold the family together.This powerful film is punctuated with Western Americana.  The first scenes introduce the viewer to ""Hud"" in a brilliant fashion.  When Hud's nephew Lonnie (who is as clean-cut as Hud is despicable) goes looking for Hud by searching out the bars, he sees wreckage everywhere, and asks a barkeep ""what happened last night?""  The answer: ""I had Hud in here last night is what I had...!""  This, of course, explains everything.This is a human drama that truly shows off Paul Newman's acting range, and this is perhaps Newman's greatest role.  Hud is unforgettable.

219526,A2RH7ARWQSUVQV,6300215962,"Ron Braithwaite ""Hummingbird God""","[2, 2]","""Hud"" is one of Newman's greatest movies but, interestingly, I find his father, the old man, more compelling.  Hud, as his old father notes, has his share of charm and even guts but he has no soul.  He doesn't care.  He doesn't care about people and lives only for himself.  He uses others, especially women, but ultimately he is his own worst enemy and his reward is a emptiness.Initially, Lonnie, his 17 y.o. nephew admires him and wants to be Hud's kind of man.  Gradually, perhaps inevitably, the nephew learns all too much about Hud both from his grandfather and Hud's own selfish and reckless behavior.  A cow dies.  Hud wants to leave the carcass to the buzzards but his father, although he has much to lose, insists on a veterinary examination.  The veterinarian suspects hoof-and-mouth, a disease that requires the slaughtering of entire herds.  Hud wants to sell off the herd before the veterinarian returns with his report.  His father refuses and Hud sees a lawyer to have his father declared incompetent...with Hud as administrator of the estate.Too late for Hud, the veterinariam returns with a report postive for hoof-and-mouth.  We grieve for the old man having to kill his cattle and livelihood in a bulldozer-excavated pit.  Hud is disgusted that he couldn't offload the cattle before this happens.Hud, as usual, gets blind drunk.  Then tries to rape the housekeeper.  Lonnie has to protect her from his drunken uncle.  By this time Lonnie's admiration for his self-centered uncle hits rock bottom.  The old man, thrown from a horse, dies of pure discouragement.  Lonnie leaves the ranch and doesn't look back.  We are left with Hud in an empty house and an empty ranch having a beer and shrugging off his nephew as if it doesn't matter.  Of course, nothing ever really matters to Hud, especially not himself.There are multiple levels that this film can be viewed.  We can view Hud as the product of an unloving father but, more correctly I think, Hud is a self-made man, worthy of contempt.Ron Braithwaite, author of novels--""Skull Rack"" and ""Hummingbird God""--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico",5,"You're a sociopath, Hud",1223683200,"10 11, 2008",2008,2113,"['Hud', 'one', 'Newman', 'greatest', 'movies', 'interestingly', 'find', 'father', 'old', 'man', 'more', 'compelling', 'Hud', 'old', 'father', 'notes', 'share', 'charm', 'even', 'guts', 'soul', ""n't"", 'care', ""n't"", 'care', 'people', 'only', 'others', 'especially', 'women', 'ultimately', 'own', 'worst', 'enemy', 'reward', 'emptiness.Initially', 'Lonnie', '17', 'y.o', 'nephew', 'be', 'Hud', 'kind', 'man', 'Gradually', 'perhaps', 'inevitably', 'nephew', 'too', 'much', 'Hud', 'grandfather', 'Hud', 'own', 'selfish', 'reckless', 'behavior', 'cow', 'Hud', 'leave', 'carcass', 'buzzards', 'father', 'much', 'lose', 'insists', 'veterinary', 'examination', 'veterinarian', 'hoof-and-mouth', 'disease', 'slaughtering', 'entire', 'herds', 'Hud', 'sell', 'off', 'herd', 'veterinarian', 'returns', 'report', 'father', 'refuses', 'Hud', 'lawyer', 'have', 'father', 'declared', 'incompetent', 'Hud', 'administrator', 'estate.Too', 'late', 'Hud', 'veterinariam', 'report', 'postive', 'hoof-and-mouth', 'grieve', 'old', 'man', 'having', 'kill', 'cattle', 'livelihood', 'bulldozer-excavated', 'pit', 'Hud', 'disgusted', 'could', ""n't"", 'offload', 'cattle', 'happens.Hud', 'usual', 'blind', 'drunk', 'Then', 'rape', 'housekeeper', 'Lonnie', 'protect', 'drunken', 'uncle', 'time', 'Lonnie', 'admiration', 'self-centered', 'uncle', 'hits', 'rock', 'bottom', 'old', 'man', 'thrown', 'horse', 'dies', 'pure', 'discouragement', 'Lonnie', 'ranch', ""n't"", 'look', 'back', 'are', 'left', 'Hud', 'empty', 'house', 'empty', 'ranch', 'having', 'beer', 'shrugging', 'off', 'nephew', ""n't"", 'matter', 'course', 'nothing', 'ever', 'really', 'matters', 'Hud', 'especially', 'not', 'are', 'multiple', 'levels', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'can', 'view', 'Hud', 'product', 'unloving', 'father', 'more', 'correctly', 'think', 'Hud', 'self-made', 'man', 'worthy', 'contempt.Ron', 'Braithwaite', 'author', 'novels', 'Skull', 'Rack', 'Hummingbird', 'God', 'Spanish', 'Conquest', 'Mexico']",Hud VHS

219538,AK61LQI92GTCH,6300215962,"Steven Hellerstedt ""SH""","[89, 94]","Welcome to the last Western.  HUD is a chronicle of what killed the western ethos - it was done in by a man with a ""barbed wire soul"" driving a pink cadillac.  Before HUD men raised cattle or plowed the earth, after HUD men ceded the land to the oil drillers.The movie opens with 17-year-old, wide-eyed Lonnie looking for Hud.  The trail leads him past a busted up saloon and ends when he finds a married woman's high heel shoe carelessly flung on her front porch.  Hud seems to have a taste for married women and a way with the bottle that the curious Lonnie finds attractive.When they get home Homer drives them out to a freshly dead heifer.  There are no bullet wounds or other signs of injury and Homer decides to call the authorities.  Hud disagrees.  If the heifer died of a disease it could jeopardize everything, and Hud is too close to inheriting the ranch for that.  Homer has more at stake,  but burying the cow without an investigation would simply be wrong. The drama proceeds from there as deliberately, and inevitably, as a Greek tragedy.Like other epics, and HUD deals with epic themes, there are great battles.  Hud Bannon battles with his father, Homer Bannon (Melvyn Douglas) for the heart and mind of his nephew Lonnie (Brandon de Wilde.)  Hud and Lonnie battle over their ""half-wild"" maid Alma (Patricia Neal.)Hud, a man of little patience, is brutally direct in his approach to Alma.  The inexperienced Lonnie admires her from a gentler distance.  Director Martin Ritt includes two scenes that highlight this difference.  One night Hud tomcats his way into Alma's room asking for a cigarette.  The experienced and wary Alma gives - Hud lights the handout and blows out the match just as Alma asks for a light.  With his back to her Hud drops the burnt out match into her hands and waits a beat before dropping the matchbook.  It's a short throwaway that highlights Hud's loutish behavior.  It gains relevance a little later when Lonnie takes a blow to the head and has to take to his bed.  Alma brings him a glass of `fresh squeezed lemonade.'  Lonnie takes the drink and a worried look beetles his brow.  Alma puts her hand under his mouth and urges him to spit.  `C'mon, honey,' she says, `they're just lemon pits.'Lonnie spits his seeds into her hand, Hud a useless, burnt out stick, and Dr. Freud has just left the building.  Maybe Ritt put those scenes in to delight louts like me four decades on.  HUD is filled with powerful, multi-layered scenes.  Another memorable one occurs when Homer Bannon's herd is driven into an enclosure.  It is very long, maybe four minutes, and deliberately edited.  I don't know if we'd see its like today, but its length and deliberation gives it awesome power.Melvyn Douglas won an Oscar in this movie, and he portrays Homer Bannon as a man about as played out as his over grazed land and about as obsolete as the two longhorn he keeps solely for sentimental reasons.  Neal also won an Oscar in this one, and her character is almost as worn out as the elder Bannon.  Life has used her hard.  Paul Newman was nominated as the title character, and in my opinion would not have made an embarrassing winner.  One of the most charming and charismatic actors in movie history, Newman manages to play a man of hollow charm.  When he flirts, we see the snake lurking behind his smile.

219539,A3QYHR31DF3YN6,6300215962,Strawgold,"[1, 1]","This movie stands in a class reserved for the best of best in western theme films. Based on the book by Larry McMurtry, ""Horseman, Pass By"", it also features a very credible performance by Brandon DeWilde as Lonnie, grown up from the little boy he once portrayed in another legend, the unforgettable ""Shane"" which was filmed about 10 years before.  Lonnie worships Hud, who is his father's brother, and the realization that this man of his own blood is not of good character, is a concept too deep for him to grasp until the final turn of events mature  him past his youth in the course of one day .  The events surrounding this relationship are at the core of the storyline, and also at the core of the conflict between Hud and his old father, Homer, played by Melvyn Dougas.Newman's star was at it's Zenith when he made this movie.  His extraordinary talent, independent of his looks, are both showcased as an integral part of the character in this role;  and play off each other to his advantage for him in this, what I considered to be one of his best movies.  His character assessment of Hud was something that came easy to him; he nailed the selfish, self-centered, narcissistic personality that was the man named Hud.Melvyn Douglas as the crusty old rancher who has seen the times pass him by, gives a performance truly outstanding as he struggles for his last stand of independence, threatened not only a dread disease that is spreading through his entire herd of cattle, but by his own failing health, seized on by the least respected of his blood kin, Hud, who sees the vulnerability that had never been there open up opportunity at last, and intends to take control of the ranch. The knowledge that he is no longer the man he was in the face of disaster, takes the heart and courage from the old man, the one thing he could always count on before; he is finally at the end of his rope.  The interaction between Douglas and Newman is truly remarkable, and the casting could not have been better chosen.Patricia Neal, unarguably one of the premiere actresses of her era, is perfect in the role of the ranch cook, a ""rainy day"" woman making her way alone in rough country and lean times; who thinks she has at last found a home with this family and even believes for awhile she can handle the subtle advances of Hud, complicated by her own unspoken physical desire for him - and put it in the proper perspective, since she knows him for what he is; she's seen many like him, but it doesn't occur to her that he will become unmanageable.I write this review as tribute to them all, on this, the time of Paul Newman's passing to join all the rest of the cast who went before him.  Even the ending is one of a kind - the slamming of the old kitchen door.""Horseman, Pass By""",5,"""Horseman, Pass By""",1222473600,"09 27, 2008",2008,2777,"['movie', 'class', 'reserved', 'best', 'best', 'western', 'theme', 'films', 'Based', 'book', 'Larry', 'McMurtry', 'Horseman', 'Pass', 'also', 'very', 'credible', 'performance', 'Brandon', 'DeWilde', 'Lonnie', 'grown', 'up', 'little', 'boy', 'once', 'portrayed', 'legend', 'unforgettable', 'Shane', 'was', 'filmed', '10', 'years', 'before', 'Lonnie', 'Hud', 'who', 'father', 'brother', 'realization', 'man', 'own', 'blood', 'not', 'good', 'character', 'concept', 'too', 'deep', 'grasp', 'final', 'turn', 'events', 'mature', 'youth', 'course', 'one', 'day', 'events', 'surrounding', 'relationship', 'are', 'core', 'storyline', 'also', 'core', 'conflict', 'Hud', 'old', 'father', 'Homer', 'played', 'Melvyn', 'Dougas.Newman', 'star', 'was', 'Zenith', 'when', 'made', 'movie', 'extraordinary', 'talent', 'independent', 'looks', 'are', 'showcased', 'integral', 'part', 'character', 'role', 'play', 'off', 'other', 'advantage', 'what', 'considered', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'character', 'assessment', 'Hud', 'was', 'something', 'came', 'easy', 'nailed', 'selfish', 'self-centered', 'narcissistic', 'personality', 'was', 'man', 'named', 'Hud.Melvyn', 'Douglas', 'crusty', 'old', 'rancher', 'who', 'seen', 'times', 'pass', 'performance', 'truly', 'outstanding', 'last', 'stand', 'independence', 'threatened', 'not', 'only', 'dread', 'disease', 'spreading', 'entire', 'herd', 'cattle', 'own', 'failing', 'health', 'seized', 'least', 'respected', 'blood', 'kin', 'Hud', 'who', 'vulnerability', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'there', 'open', 'up', 'opportunity', 'last', 'take', 'control', 'ranch', 'knowledge', 'no', 'longer', 'man', 'was', 'face', 'disaster', 'heart', 'courage', 'old', 'man', 'one', 'thing', 'could', 'always', 'count', 'before', 'finally', 'end', 'rope', 'interaction', 'Douglas', 'Newman', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'casting', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'chosen.Patricia', 'Neal', 'unarguably', 'one', 'premiere', 'actresses', 'era', 'perfect', 'role', 'ranch', 'cook', 'rainy', 'day', 'woman', 'making', 'way', 'alone', 'rough', 'country', 'lean', 'times', 'who', 'last', 'found', 'home', 'family', 'even', 'can', 'handle', 'subtle', 'advances', 'Hud', 'complicated', 'own', 'unspoken', 'physical', 'desire', 'put', 'proper', 'perspective', 'what', 'seen', 'many', ""n't"", 'occur', 'will', 'become', 'unmanageable.I', 'write', 'review', 'tribute', 'time', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'passing', 'join', 'rest', 'cast', 'who', 'went', 'Even', 'ending', 'one', 'kind', 'slamming', 'old', 'kitchen', 'door', 'Horseman', 'Pass']",Hud VHS

219544,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,6300215962,Westley,"[7, 8]","Hud, adapted from the short novel (Horseman, Pass By) by Larry McMurtry, is one of the greatest Westerns of all-time.  Paul Newman plays the title character, and it's arguably his best performance.  His father, Homer, (Melvyn Douglass) is a cattle rancher, and the two of them are constantly at odds.  Homer is the kind of character we're used to seeing in Westerns - upstanding, honest, and a lover of the land.  In contrast, Hud cares only about himself and his own pleasure, including chasing married women.  Torn between the two is Lon (Brandon de Wilde), the son of Homer's older son who died.  He admires his grandfather and is a cattleman at heart, but he cannot help but be drawn to the wild Hud and his much more exciting lifestyle.This push and pull ends up having tragic consequences for all.  Patricia Neal is also on hand as the family's maid and the only major female character.  Of interest, in the book, Neal's character is African-American and race relations are explored.The acting is truly top-notch; the performances are so natural and easy-going that it's easy to overlook the greatness of the cast.  Patricia Neal won the Oscar for Best Actress and Melvyn Douglass won for Best Supporting Actor.  Despite the oustanding acting, the real star is the theme - the death of the old west and the rise of a new Texas.  As such, the movie is very bittersweet.  If you like this movie, you should also check out the novel, as well as the novel and movie ""The Last Picture Show,"" which was also written by Larry McMurty and explores similar themes.

219546,A3VRFC5A5CJ3UX,6300215962,W. Roe,"[2, 2]","I was excited to see this was recently included with my prime membership! Sometimes titles are free one day and need to be rented the next. I find it confusing sometimes as why I would want to purchase media that I only ""own"" as long as I continue my prime membership. On to the film...I had remembered little of the film and had last seen it over 20 years ago. I understand that it is taken from a book titled ""Horseman, Pass By"" which I believe is told through Hud's young teenage nephew Lonnie. The film, on the other hand, is focused squarely on Paul Newman's character ""Hud"", and is a sad story revealing how he became the self centered womanizer racing down the road in his pink Cadillac. I found Newman's performance a complex, compelling and emotional portrayal of the tragically misunderstood son of Homer Bannon, an aging and uncompromising Texas cattleman. The theme might be described as illustrating the emotional damage that can sometimes be inflicted on one another and passed on through misunderstanding. The dry, harsh Texas landscape seems to echo the feeling of a hard heart without love.Synopsis:Lonnie's radio, carried in his chest pocket' plays the sad and mournful song ""Driftwood On The River"" that defines the film as he finds Hud in the opening scene...""I'm just driftwood floating down the tideI don't care where this old river carries meI'll keep drifting just because my heart is broken insideAnd I'm tired of wishing for what cannot be""My impression is that the film depicts tragic emotional consequences to the four main characters, stemming from Hud's father being unable to recognize his own failure to provide the parental love and understanding his son wanted and needed. Hud mistakenly believes that his father never forgave him for the car accident which took the life of Norman, Huds older brother and Lonnie's father, when they were teenagers and having wild fun. The reality, when learned is even more destructive to Hud and he then plans to hurt back. Homer is cold hearted towards Hud who we discover had never lived up to his father's stern standards...even as a child. Hud appears to live a life of selfish pleasure but it is a disguise to hide his pain, endured from his lifelong treatment at the hands of his uncompromising and unloving father. It has also resulted in him having a fear of emotional attachment that prevents him from any meaningful relationship. This is symbolized in the greased pig contest where Hud is admired for his meaningless success without emotional risk. His elderly widower father is highly principled and has spent his life building their ranch, the focus of his life's work. He is unable to recognize and understand the damage he has inflicted on Hud and how it has affected all of their lives. Homer has heart problems and when questioned by Lonnie about his treatment to Hud says ""...sometimes old people get as hard as their arteries"". This seems as allegory of the hardness in his heart which is killing him and has killed the love between a father and son as well as destroying Hud's potential to show love to others (as he is seen always fooling with married women). Lonnie is Huds teenage nephew and has a good relationship with his grandfather, as is common with grandparents.  He also looks up to Hud and gradually they begin to bond. During a bitter hurtful encounter with his father, Hud is devastated to learn that his father had turned away from him even before his brothers death saying "" I was sick of you a long time before that."" Homer tells Lonnie that one day he will need to decide for himself what is right and wrong. Hud is hurt and begins to plan how to get control of the ranch away from his father. He informs Lonnie of his intent who (off camera) tells his grandfather. Homer confronts Hud who tells him he is too old and can't make good decisions. Hud sees his father as unloving and unwilling to accept his own son. Homer admits that he may have made some mistakes but cannot forgive Hud who he sees as uncaring and selfish. He tells Hud that he does not know how he could have fathered him.  Hud angrily stumbles down the stairs as Lonnie stands on the landing watching him descend. As if in a rage of desperately seeking love, Hud goes outside and breaks into the lonely (and hurt from previous relationships) housekeeper Alma's cabin where he drunkenly attempts to force himself on her but is interrupted by Lonnie. Hud pins Lonnie but pulls back before striking him and leaves when he realizes he is about to hurt his nephew. The diseased cattle must be herded into a pit and killed. Homer tasks himself with shooting his two prizes Texas longhorns which he has raised...seemingly meaning more to him than his son. Alma quits and Lonnie drops her at the bus depot before driving off towards the ranch. Hud sees Alma waiting for the bus and apologizes. She says she sometimes wanted to be with him and he realizes she is ""...the one who got away"" and that they might have been found each other but it is too late. The signs read ""Rest Room Inside"" as if they each retreat inside themselves to  find peace to avoid being hurt from any relationship. As Lonnie drives home in the pickup, Hud comes from behind in his pink Caddy convertible and wants to pass and have fun with Lonnie and bumps the truck. Immediately Lonnie has to swerve into a ditch to avoid running over his grandfather who has fallen off his horse and is seen crawling on the road. Hud lovingly cradles his dying father and tells Lonnie to take his car to get help but the Caddy won't start. Homer tells Lonnie to stay with him as he is dying. With his last breath the old man throws Hud away telling Lonnie that Hud is just waiting for him to die, plunging another cruel dagger into Hud's heart. Lonnie pushes Hud's hand away and cradles the old man. This scene seems a metaphor of the characters emotional damage with Homers crippling love of the land leading to the family's car crash/destruction. At the funeral, Lonnie believes Hud contributed to the old mans death and blames him for his grandfather not wanting to live. The reality is that Homer had played the key role in his world imploding with the earlier loss of his cattle that was a direct result of his own (stubborn?)decision to buy the Mexican cattle which infected his herd with the deadly hoof and mouth disease. Lonnie returns to the ranch and is seen alone in the middle of the vast empty corals. Hud returns from the funeral and seems to want Lonnie to stay on. In the final shot, as Hud stands alone by the door and watches Lonnie walk away, his expression changes from a look of sorrow to an uncaring smirk, he closes the door and retreats inside. The pull on the mostly drawn shade on the door window dangles perhaps recalling a noose. Hud's emotional destruction is complete with Hud alone and all of the ones who might or even should have loved one another now gone, never coming together to recognize, understand and discover the love that could have been, his smile simply the mask to cover his wounded soul.",5,Hud...a tragic and misunderstood figure?,1374278400,"07 20, 2013",2013,7060,"['was', 'excited', 'see', 'was',
