Bening's performance earned her a Golden Globe, she is marvelous and has a great sense of humor to play a woman who's husband is cheating on her.

880507,A6F61DLQJEURB,B0007G89FK,Andrea Bowhill,"[2, 2]","Set in London 1938, the film focuses on a highly successful and extremely popular theatre actress Julia Lambert (Annette Bening). Married with one son, a woman whose got it all, but, there's still a wanting, a yearning, something is missing. Julia's fast approaching middle age, but the fire seems to have gone out, lacking in passion for her talent,  tedious of late and stuck on auto drive. Julia's gradual disillusionment has made her feel tired of it all, lost, something has to give. Julia prompts her husband, stage director Michael Gosselyn, (Jeremy Irons) and  the financial backer, Dolly de Vries, (Miriam Margolyes) to close her current production in order to take time out and travel aboard, find her perspective, but they persuade Julia to at least take the production to the end of the summer.Her Husband Michael then Introduces Julia to a young Tom Fennel, (Shaun Evans) an american whose set about enterprising himself in London and has great taxation ideas. Tom can't believe his luck, meeting the famous Julia Lambert, his quick to confess to being a hugh admirer of Julia's work. Julia is also quick to fill a void in her life, her now twenty year marriage has gone passionless and clearly become just quiet something else. So Julia embarks on a passionate affair with Tom but soon falls madly in love with him, she also supports him, so that he too can enjoy her glamorous life style. The relationship revives her vibrant sparkle, while everyone else notices the personality change for the better, what about her control in other areas?Always watching over Julia is her ghostly mentor, Jimmie Langton, (Michael Gambon) who was a theatrical manager of a provincial theatre. Jimmie gave Julia her start and made her a big star, a brilliant actress, although his long passed away Jimmie remains a fragment of her imagination, when Julia needs help in moments of emotional thoughts, Jimmies' still her driving force. Meanwhile back in the real world, her personal maid, dresser and confident Evie (Juliet Stevenson) keeps her grounded.But are things about to fall apart! Clearly Tom's social climbing and has now met ambitious young aspiring actress Avice Crichton, (Lucy Punch). Avice, has hatched plans and has her own callous ideas to make higher ground by starring in Julia's next play. Julia's, best friend Lord Charles (Bruce Greenwood) steps in to support Julia's emotional turmoil, but only as a friend! Julia sets about her plans for revenge, contempt for all involved in any betrayal, opening night performance of her new play, let the farce begin.""The sweet things in life, to you were just loaned""""So how can you lose what you've never owned""?""Life is just a bowl of cherries"",""So live and laugh at it all"".There are so many things I loved about this film, 1930's England, theatre life, the music, the joy and although this is set in the 30's the emotions of this piece remain contemporary, falling in love, falling out of love, making a fool of yourself, having a triumphant moment or a feeling like you want to die.The casting is fantastic in this film, Annette Bening plays Julia Brilliantly, vibrantly, intelligently, giddy, reckless, dramatic and diva showing that in life all people make mistake but you pick yourself up and go forward. Well, matched in family matters against Bening's performance were Jeremy Irons as the sophisticated husband and good looking Tom Sturridge playing the son Roger, there's a very touching scene between mother and son.Loved Michael Gambon performance as the ghostly mentor Jimmie Langton just brings that sense of fun!(Julia's in real emotional turmoil, floods of tears) ""Now that's the real thing Julia, or my name's not Jimmie Langton, but I've got some notes, You're still going over the top you've got to learn restraints"".We all at times would love to have someone whisper in our ear; lay it on the line and tell us how it really should be.Not only the cast and writing of this which was great, but a nice touch popular songs of the era They Didn't Believe Me, Life Is Just a Bowl of Cherries, Mad about the Boy, I Get a Kick Out of You, She's My Lovely and many more. Directed by Istvan Szabo,  Screenwriter Ronald Harwood, overall it worked, I wanted to be entertained and this film is entertaining; a lovely and joyful film to watch.Great Film Recommended.Andrea Bowhill",4,"""Life is Just a Bowl of Cherries"" "" Don't take it Serious; it's too Mysterious"".",1245456000,"06 20, 2009",2009,4345,"['Set', 'London', '1938', 'film', 'highly', 'successful', 'extremely', 'popular', 'theatre', 'actress', 'Julia', 'Lambert', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'Married', 'one', 'son', 'woman', 'got', 'still', 'wanting', 'yearning', 'something', 'missing', 'Julia', 'fast', 'approaching', 'middle', 'age', 'fire', 'have', 'gone', 'out', 'lacking', 'passion', 'talent', 'tedious', 'late', 'stuck', 'auto', 'drive', 'Julia', 'gradual', 'disillusionment', 'made', 'feel', 'lost', 'something', 'give', 'Julia', 'husband', 'stage', 'director', 'Michael', 'Gosselyn', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'financial', 'backer', 'Dolly', 'de', 'Vries', 'Miriam', 'Margolyes', 'close', 'current', 'production', 'order', 'take', 'time', 'travel', 'aboard', 'find', 'perspective', 'persuade', 'Julia', 'least', 'take', 'production', 'end', 'summer.Her', 'Husband', 'Michael', 'then', 'Julia', 'young', 'Tom', 'Fennel', 'Shaun', 'Evans', 'american', 'set', 'enterprising', 'London', 'great', 'taxation', 'ideas', 'Tom', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'luck', 'meeting', 'famous', 'Julia', 'Lambert', 'quick', 'confess', 'being', 'hugh', 'admirer', 'Julia', 'work', 'Julia', 'also', 'quick', 'fill', 'void', 'life', 'now', 'twenty', 'year', 'marriage', 'gone', 'passionless', 'clearly', 'become', 'just', 'quiet', 'something', 'else', 'So', 'Julia', 'passionate', 'affair', 'Tom', 'soon', 'falls', 'madly', 'love', 'also', 'so', 'too', 'can', 'enjoy', 'glamorous', 'life', 'style', 'relationship', 'vibrant', 'sparkle', 'everyone', 'else', 'personality', 'change', 'better', 'what', 'control', 'other', 'areas', 'Always', 'watching', 'Julia', 'ghostly', 'mentor', 'Jimmie', 'Langton', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'who', 'was', 'theatrical', 'manager', 'provincial', 'theatre', 'Jimmie', 'gave', 'Julia', 'start', 'made', 'big', 'star', 'brilliant', 'actress', 'long', 'passed', 'away', 'Jimmie', 'fragment', 'imagination', 'when', 'Julia', 'help', 'moments', 'emotional', 'thoughts', 'Jimmies', 'still', 'driving', 'force', 'Meanwhile', 'back', 'real', 'world', 'personal', 'maid', 'dresser', 'confident', 'Evie', 'Juliet', 'Stevenson', 'grounded.But', 'are', 'things', 'fall', 'apart', 'Clearly', 'Tom', 'social', 'climbing', 'now', 'met', 'ambitious', 'young', 'aspiring', 'actress', 'Avice', 'Crichton', 'Lucy', 'Punch', 'Avice', 'hatched', 'plans', 'own', 'callous', 'ideas', 'make', 'higher', 'ground', 'starring', 'Julia', 'next', 'play', 'Julia', 'best', 'friend', 'Lord', 'Charles', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'steps', 'support', 'Julia', 'emotional', 'turmoil', 'only', 'friend', 'Julia', 'plans', 'revenge', 'contempt', 'involved', 'betrayal', 'opening', 'night', 'performance', 'new', 'play', 'let', 'farce', 'begin', 'sweet', 'things', 'life', 'were', 'just', 'loaned', 'how', 'can', 'lose', 'what', ""'ve"", 'never', 'owned', 'Life', 'just', 'bowl', 'cherries', 'So', 'live', 'laugh', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'loved', 'film', '1930', 'England', 'theatre', 'life', 'music', 'joy', 'set', '30', 'emotions', 'piece', 'remain', 'contemporary', 'falling', 'love', 'falling', 'love', 'making', 'fool', 'having', 'triumphant', 'moment', 'feeling', 'want', 'die.The', 'casting', 'fantastic', 'film', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'Julia', 'Brilliantly', 'vibrantly', 'intelligently', 'giddy', 'reckless', 'dramatic', 'diva', 'showing', 'life', 'people', 'make', 'mistake', 'pick', 'up', 'go', 'forward', 'Well', 'matched', 'family', 'matters', 'Bening', 'performance', 'were', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'sophisticated', 'husband', 'good', 'looking', 'Tom', 'Sturridge', 'playing', 'son', 'Roger', 'very', 'touching', 'scene', 'mother', 'son.Loved', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'performance', 'ghostly', 'mentor', 'Jimmie', 'Langton', 'just', 'sense', 'fun', 'Julia', 'real', 'emotional', 'turmoil', 'floods', 'tears', 'Now', 'real', 'thing', 'Julia', 'name', 'not', 'Jimmie', 'Langton', ""'ve"", 'got', 'notes', ""'re"", 'still', 'going', 'top', ""'ve"", 'got', 'learn', 'restraints', '.We', 'times', 'would', 'love', 'have', 'someone', 'whisper', 'ear', 'lay', 'line', 'tell', 'how', 'really', 'should', 'be.Not', 'only', 'cast', 'writing', 'was', 'great', 'nice', 'touch', 'popular', 'songs', 'era', 'Did', ""n't"", 'Believe', 'Me', 'Life', 'Just', 'Bowl', 'Cherries', 'Mad', 'Boy', 'Get', 'Kick', 'Out', 'My', 'Lovely', 'many', 'more', 'Directed', 'Istvan', 'Szabo', 'Screenwriter', 'Ronald', 'Harwood', 'overall', 'worked', 'wanted', 'be', 'entertained', 'film', 'entertaining', 'lovely', 'joyful', 'film', 'watch.Great', 'Film', 'Recommended.Andrea', 'Bowhill']",N/A
880508,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0007G89FK,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","If you ask me, I strongly feel that the Academy did a stand-up job with their Best Actress nominations in 2004.  Sure, I don't think they handled ANYTHING else right that year, but those five nominated ladies (for those unaware, they were Annette Bening for `Being Julie', Catalina Sandino Moreno for `Maria Full of Grace', Imelda Staunton for `Vera Drake', Hilary Swank for `Million Dollar Baby' and Kate Winslet for `Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind') were the undeniable cream of the crop and all stand as some of the best performances of the entire decade.  While I believe that the least deserving performance actually won (the Oscar should have went to Winslet in my opinion), I cannot fault the Academy for nominating or even crowning Swank, for her performance was astonishing.But this is about Annette Bening.I open my review like such because every time I think about this incredible lineup I get shivers (it's that good).  Oscar has never been so astute with their nominations, at least not this particular decade, and the fact that they got it SOOOO right (I'm tempted to say that this would be my lineup as well, but then there is that under-seen and undervalued Maggie Cheung performance in `Clean' that screams ""NOMINATE ME OVER SWANK"" into my ear, and I'm tempted to listen) gives me hope that one day soon they will get it this right again.Hopefully they will award the right actress this next time though!Anyways, onto the film at hand.`Being Julia' is a rapturously entertaining spectacle that captures the spirit of its star gloriously.  The film centers around a theater star named Julia Lambert.  The film is set in pre-WWII London and unravels over the course of Julia's love affair with a much younger man named Tom (T-O-M).  Tom is an American who is smitten with Julia, and she (against her better judgment) becomes smitten with him as well.  You see, Julia is falling apart.  She is becoming overwhelmed by her own star persona, and as her age keeps increasing she is finding her emotional state a bit of a whirlwind.  Tom presents her with a chance to free herself from her own cage and find a part of her youth she has not until then been able to entertain.Things become very good for Julia, until they begin to fall apart.As a film, I feel like there are some aspects of the script that needed a little more tweaking.  The film's final act feels a tad rushed and under-developed (even if that final stage performance sequence is delicious), and the true intentions of Tom are never really given the ample time needed to flesh them out fully.  We are left wondering how it was he actually felt about Julia.That said, this film leaves Annette Bening front and center and allows her the chew away at the scenery surrounding her, to splendid results.  I have always considered Bening a theatrical actress.  She is usually over-the-top and at times annoying.  She has worked magic with her own style in films like `American Beauty', where her obnoxiousness suited the development of her character, and I thoroughly enjoyed the way she toned down her persona in `The Grifters' (for which she should have won that Oscar).  Here, it is almost as if this character was written for her, for it fits beautifully with her acting approach to create the perfect performance from her.  Every line that flies from her lips is perfectly in tune with this character and seems so natural, so connected and thus becomes completely effective.This is the performance she was BORN to give.I mean, the rest of the cast is also quite fine, but you can forget about them because this is Bening's film and her film alone!Technically, there is a lot to admire here.  The editing is stunning (the film just looks flawless), the costumes are compelling, the performances are in sync, the direction is effortless (the way the tension builds so whimsically is just flawless); everything seems to compliment each other here.  I do have my issues with the script in places (this film needed a little more length and some more explanation in areas) but don't let that detour you from feasting your eyes on a true triumph of acting on the part of the illustrious Annette Bening.WHERE IS HER OSCAR!?!?!?!?!",4,Bening deserves a standing ovation...,1271030400,"04 12, 2010",2010,4204,"['ask', 'strongly', 'feel', 'Academy', 'did', 'stand-up', 'job', 'Best', 'Actress', 'nominations', '2004', 'Sure', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'handled', 'ANYTHING', 'else', 'right', 'year', 'five', 'nominated', 'ladies', 'unaware', 'were', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'Being', 'Julie', 'Catalina', 'Sandino', 'Moreno', 'Maria', 'Full', 'Grace', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'Vera', 'Drake', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'were', 'undeniable', 'cream', 'crop', 'stand', 'best', 'performances', 'entire', 'decade', 'believe', 'least', 'deserving', 'performance', 'actually', 'won', 'Oscar', 'should', 'have', 'went', 'Winslet', 'opinion', 'can', 'not', 'fault', 'Academy', 'nominating', 'even', 'crowning', 'Swank', 'performance', 'was', 'astonishing.But', 'Annette', 'Bening.I', 'open', 'review', 'such', 'time', 'think', 'incredible', 'lineup', 'get', 'shivers', 'good', 'Oscar', 'never', 'been', 'so', 'astute', 'nominations', 'least', 'not', 'particular', 'decade', 'fact', 'got', 'SOOOO', 'right', ""'m"", 'tempted', 'say', 'would', 'be', 'lineup', 'as', 'well', 'then', 'under-seen', 'undervalued', 'Maggie', 'Cheung', 'performance', 'Clean', 'NOMINATE', 'ME', 'OVER', 'SWANK', 'ear', ""'m"", 'tempted', 'listen', 'hope', 'one', 'day', 'soon', 'will', 'get', 'right', 'again.Hopefully', 'will', 'award', 'right', 'actress', 'next', 'time', 'Anyways', 'film', 'hand.', 'Being', 'Julia', 'rapturously', 'entertaining', 'spectacle', 'spirit', 'star', 'gloriously', 'film', 'centers', 'theater', 'star', 'named', 'Julia', 'Lambert', 'film', 'set', 'pre-WWII', 'London', 'unravels', 'course', 'Julia', 'love', 'affair', 'much', 'younger', 'man', 'named', 'Tom', 'T-O-M', 'Tom', 'American', 'who', 'smitten', 'Julia', 'better', 'judgment', 'smitten', 'as', 'well', 'see', 'Julia', 'falling', 'apart', 'becoming', 'overwhelmed', 'own', 'star', 'persona', 'age', 'increasing', 'finding', 'emotional', 'state', 'bit', 'whirlwind', 'Tom', 'chance', 'free', 'own', 'cage', 'find', 'part', 'youth', 'not', 'then', 'been', 'able', 'entertain.Things', 'become', 'very', 'good', 'Julia', 'begin', 'fall', 'apart.As', 'film', 'feel', 'are', 'aspects', 'script', 'needed', 'little', 'more', 'tweaking', 'film', 'final', 'act', 'tad', 'rushed', 'under-developed', 'even', 'final', 'stage', 'performance', 'sequence', 'delicious', 'true', 'intentions', 'Tom', 'are', 'never', 'really', 'given', 'ample', 'time', 'needed', 'flesh', 'out', 'fully', 'are', 'left', 'wondering', 'how', 'was', 'actually', 'felt', 'Julia.That', 'said', 'film', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'front', 'center', 'chew', 'away', 'scenery', 'surrounding', 'splendid', 'results', 'have', 'always', 'considered', 'Bening', 'theatrical', 'actress', 'usually', 'over-the-top', 'times', 'annoying', 'worked', 'magic', 'own', 'style', 'films', 'American', 'Beauty', 'where', 'obnoxiousness', 'suited', 'development', 'character', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'way', 'toned', 'down', 'persona', 'Grifters', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Here', 'almost', 'character', 'was', 'written', 'beautifully', 'acting', 'approach', 'create', 'perfect', 'performance', 'line', 'flies', 'lips', 'perfectly', 'tune', 'character', 'so', 'natural', 'so', 'connected', 'thus', 'becomes', 'completely', 'effective.This', 'performance', 'was', 'BORN', 'give.I', 'mean', 'rest', 'cast', 'also', 'quite', 'fine', 'can', 'forget', 'Bening', 'film', 'film', 'alone', 'Technically', 'lot', 'admire', 'here', 'editing', 'stunning', 'film', 'just', 'flawless', 'costumes', 'are', 'compelling', 'performances', 'are', 'sync', 'direction', 'effortless', 'way', 'tension', 'so', 'whimsically', 'just', 'flawless', 'everything', 'compliment', 'other', 'here', 'do', 'have', 'issues', 'script', 'places', 'film', 'needed', 'little', 'more', 'length', 'more', 'explanation', 'areas', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'detour', 'feasting', 'eyes', 'true', 'triumph', 'acting', 'part', 'illustrious', 'Annette', 'Bening.WHERE', 'HER', 'OSCAR']",N/A

880512,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B0007G89FK,C. B Collins Jr.,"[1, 1]","Annette Bening and Jeremy Irons are superb in the film Being Julia. Bening plays a successful actress enjoying fame and fortune even though she is reaching close to 50 years old. She and her husband, played by Irons, have long had an open marriage.  They are business partners as well as parents to a young college age son. Bening plays in one hit play after another but she is reaching the point of artistic, spiritual and physical exhaustion. She meets a handsome gentleman her age for dinner engagements and his attentions and wise advice certainly helps her maintain stability, but she is highly vulnerable as she starts to fall in the mid-life crisis age.Into this situation falls a handsome young American man with great enthusiasm for Julia and for show business. He seems innocent and young and naive but this is hardly the case. When pursuing a woman, he is determined, self-assured, assertive, funny, fun loving and knowing beyond his years. What does a famous actress do when faced with a handsome adoring younger man while she is in the midst of a vulnerable mid-life crisis?Julia, who is a master of the stage, is somewhat vulnerable when dealing with real emotional experiences. The ghost of her former friend and director appears often to give her advice on emotion and reality, but Julia makes every wrong move with the handsome young man. She violates the three primary rules of the game of affairs. She admits to him that she has fallen in love with him, she shows open jealousy and possessiveness, and she becomes clinging and weepy. This is the perfect formula to drive a new lover away. To make matters worse, she gives him expensive gifts and lends him money for his debts.When a young, talented, beautiful aspiring actress comes into the scene, the formula changes.

A too-rarely seen Annette Bening stars as the title character, a ""thetah"" actress who seems to be losing some of her luster as she progresses in age.  The essential crux of the film finds Julia coming full circle, but not before doubting her talent, having an affair(with a bland,trying-too-hard Shaun Evans), and being chastised by her only child regarding her penchant for ""acting""--even offstage.  The majority of the supporting players are first-rate--Jeremy Irons as Julia's philandering husband, the wry Lucy Punch(as Eve  to Julia's Margo Channing), and the sublime Juliet Stevenson who, as Julia's maid/rehearsal assistant, provided the most potentially fascinating yet criminally underdeveloped relationship in the film.  As for Bening, the beginning of  the film is slow-going, and it seems early on as though  she's playing Julia as a melodramatic, one-note caricature.  Once the film gets going, however, the many layers with which she plays the character slowly begins to unfold, and thus we begin to witness the sheer genius of Bening's portrayal.

The stakes were great - winning back her audience, her family, her son and most important of all, her drive to move on. Having watched it on DVD, I kept thinking when I would watch it a second time! And the pace of the movie was just right, never boring for a moment, in building the storyline all the way to the climax.The movie succeeded in creating a backdrop of British air in 1938 - a grand theatre, rich people with genuine British accent, magnificent houses and countryside. Annette Bening got a wonderful role, which she executed flawlessly, and the elegant looks, especially when she wore light make-up. The several scenes when she talked to her son as a mother and her frustration and loneliness as a middle-aged woman at the top of her career, were most touching. How Julia reacted when her husband (Jeremy Irons)told her how awful her acting had turned, but was convinced nevertheless, was overwhelming.The solid supporting cast made a real difference to the movie.  Juliet Stevenson (Bening's assistant), Miriam Margolyes (the play's financial partner) and Michael Gambon (deceased Bening's mentor who talked to Bening in her imagination) were subtle and lent gravity and depth to the movie. The movie was a play itself with carefully written diagloue. When Julia used her lines in the play to talk to the real people around her, as her son remarked, Julia knew her troubles. Unless she came out from the play and embraced reality, she would never be happy.The nice surprise was Lucy Punch (Cinderella and Ella Enchanted). She was the newcomer who was the cause of Bening's heartache, yet I almost felt sorry for her as we see how she was outperformed and devastated on stage by Annette Bening. I hope she will be awarded serious roles like this one in future and not stuck with the beautiful but dumb roles as she got in the past.This was a thought-provoking and meticulously crafted play-cum-film - whose props, design and costumes, on and off the play, were breathtaking; whose lines were impeccable; whose characters were real and well acted; whose music score was pleasing to the ears. On the stage, the play ended with a standing ovation to Julia's best stage performance ever; Off the stage, the audience witnessed Julia's complete transformation into a real person who started enjoying a new life - a most satifying and happy ending indeed.

She's 45 or so, a little bored, has a friendly and open marriage with her husband, Michael Gosselyn (Jeremy Irons), and only really comes alive when she's acting, which she does most of the time, on stage or off. She has an affair with a boy half her age, who may or may not be as innocent and enthusiastic about her as he seems. She copes, she acts, and she deals with an ambitious young actress. By the end of the movie Julia has rediscovered her passion and enthusiasm for both living and acting.I think this is a pleasant, slightly malicious and amusing period comedy about the theatre -- and that's theater with an re, please -- with a tour de force performance by Annette Bening. There are times when she brings a scene close to melodrama, but not too close, and then veers off into farce. The movie is all about Julia, and Bening makes her into a fascinating, vulnerable and maliciously resourceful woman. The other actors, and there are many well-known names in the cast including Michael Gambon, all serve to frame the picture around her. The one thing I found unsettling was seeing that great actress Juliet Stevenson, who could have played the title character -- relegated to a role that 40 years ago would have been handled by Thelma Ritter.The film is satisfying and amusing, and wouldn't have worked without Bening. One other element that is first-rate is the score by Mychael Danna. He has come up with a recurrent theme that is almost classical, romantic and a little poignant.

880518,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,B0007G89FK,Craig MACKINNON,"[7, 10]","Being Julia is the story of an aging stage actress in the midst of a  successful play in 1938.  The setting is unimportant, except as atmosphere - it really feels more like 1922 and could equally fit into 1965.  Julia is bored with the part, bored with her life, and needs something to bring back her energy.  In walks Tom, with whom she starts an affair, and a new play, in which she will star.  She comes back to life, but then Tom leaves her for a much younger girl, and Julia is left to plot her revenge, which she unleashes on the opening night of the new play.Such a story synopsis is not important.  This is a story that has been told many times in many languages (this exact story has been made twice each in German and French, apparently).  The fun is in the dialogue and the acting.  Benning covers the widest range, and skillfully allows the audience (but not necessarily the other characters) to see exactly what she is feeling, while simultaneously acting another part for the characters in the film.  The performance certainly deserved the Oscar nomination she received.  The supporting characters (and they are all supporting Benning) - Jeremy Irons as her husband, Lucy Punch as the young up-and-coming actress, and Michael Gambon as the ""ghost"" of Julia's mentor - are also well-acted and generally provide what is required of them.  Similarly, the script gives us many memorable moments, and some nifty one-liners, and we are well entertained for the 100 minutes running time.Unfortunately, the ending leaves me somewhat baffled.  It cannot be discussed without revealing certain plot points, but I don't mind doing it because the plot is not the point of the film anyways!  To wit: Julia's revenge is wreaked solely upon the young actress who takes Tom away from Julia.  Unfortunately, we never feel any kind of dislike towards her - she is likeable, sincere (more so than the other main characters), and may not even know that she has stolen Tom from Julia.  Therefore, as Julia takes her revenge, we are left pitying the target rather than exalting in the heroine's triumph.  To compound the problem, all the other main characters take an irrepresible joy in Julia's revenge, even though most of them could not know why she has unleashed her fury on the young actress.  The entire experience of the film is soured by this event, and you are left despising Julia.This DVD edition is about what you'd expect for a film of this kind.  There are some deleted scenes, mostly expanding on Julia's peripheral relationships (such as with her servant) that are fun in and of themselves.  There are two brief making-of featurettes as well.  Not much, but a film like this is all dialogue and performances, so there's not much else you need other than the film itself.",3,Enjoyable fluff marred by misguided ending,1118707200,"06 14, 2005",2005,2778,"['Being', 'Julia', 'story', 'aging', 'stage', 'actress', 'midst', 'successful', 'play', '1938', 'setting', 'unimportant', 'atmosphere', 'really', 'more', '1922', 'could', 'equally', 'fit', '1965', 'Julia', 'bored', 'part', 'bored', 'life', 'something', 'bring', 'back', 'energy', 'walks', 'Tom', 'whom', 'affair', 'new', 'play', 'will', 'star', 'back', 'life', 'then', 'Tom', 'much', 'younger', 'girl', 'Julia', 'left', 'plot', 'revenge', 'opening', 'night', 'new', 'play.Such', 'story', 'synopsis', 'not', 'important', 'story', 'been', 'told', 'many', 'times', 'many', 'languages', 'exact', 'story', 'been', 'made', 'twice', 'German', 'French', 'apparently', 'fun', 'dialogue', 'acting', 'Benning', 'widest', 'range', 'skillfully', 'audience', 'not', 'necessarily', 'other', 'characters', 'see', 'exactly', 'what', 'feeling', 'simultaneously', 'acting', 'part', 'characters', 'film', 'performance', 'certainly', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'received', 'supporting', 'characters', 'are', 'supporting', 'Benning', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'husband', 'Lucy', 'Punch', 'young', 'up-and-coming', 'actress', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'ghost', 'Julia', 'mentor', 'are', 'also', 'well-acted', 'generally', 'provide', 'what', 'required', 'Similarly', 'script', 'many', 'memorable', 'moments', 'nifty', 'one-liners', 'are', 'well', 'entertained', '100', 'minutes', 'running', 'time.Unfortunately', 'ending', 'leaves', 'somewhat', 'baffled', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'discussed', 'revealing', 'certain', 'plot', 'points', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'doing', 'plot', 'not', 'point', 'film', 'wit', 'Julia', 'revenge', 'wreaked', 'solely', 'young', 'actress', 'who', 'Tom', 'away', 'Julia', 'Unfortunately', 'never', 'feel', 'kind', 'dislike', 'likeable', 'sincere', 'more', 'so', 'other', 'main', 'characters', 'may', 'not', 'even', 'know', 'stolen', 'Tom', 'Julia', 'Therefore', 'Julia', 'revenge', 'are', 'left', 'pitying', 'target', 'rather', 'exalting', 'heroine', 'triumph', 'compound', 'problem', 'other', 'main', 'characters', 'take', 'irrepresible', 'joy', 'Julia', 'revenge', 'even', 'most', 'could', 'not', 'know', 'why', 'unleashed', 'fury', 'young', 'actress', 'entire', 'experience', 'film', 'soured', 'event', 'are', 'left', 'despising', 'Julia.This', 'DVD', 'edition', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'film', 'kind', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'mostly', 'expanding', 'Julia', 'peripheral', 'relationships', 'such', 'servant', 'are', 'fun', 'are', 'two', 'brief', 'making-of', 'featurettes', 'well', 'Not', 'much', 'film', 'dialogue', 'performances', 'not', 'much', 'need', 'other', 'film']",N/A
880519,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B0007G89FK,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[2, 2]","I was completely taken by both Annette Bening and the storyline itself of this movie.  I've never been a big fan of Bening's, but I now see that this is obviously because I have not seen very many of her movies - she's fabulous in the role of Julia Lambert, the absolute diva of the 1930s London stage.  Her range as an actress is gloriously showcased in this adaptation of W. Somerset Maugham's novella Theatre, and I absolutely ate up everything she gave me in her performance.  Being Julia really is all about Annette Bening; everyone else is just part of her supporting cast.At 45, Julia Lambert is beginning to feel her age and basically goes through a mid-life crisis, albeit one of theatrical proportions.  Exhausted by it all, she begs her director husband for a holiday.  About this same time, though, she happens to meet a star struck young American named Tom (Shaun Evans), and - despite the fact the lad has no personality and is as transparent as the day is long - she soon begins having an affair with him.  Suddenly, she is happy and vibrant once again - until jealousy rears its ugly head.  Julia makes quite a fool of herself in front of Tom, decrying her love for him, but another young lady captures his heart (or his affections, anyway, as I'm not convinced Tom has a heart).  This young tart, Avice Crichton (Lucy Punch) fancies herself an actress, and Julia magnanimously supports her for a part in her new play.  To my surprise, Avice actually gets the part (despite the fact that, so far as I could tell, she couldn't act her way out of a dark room with a flashlight).  Of course, talent isn't always everything.  Rejuvenated by some time away, Julia returns quite prepared for her new play, and the ending of the film centers around opening night.  It's hard to discuss the ending without giving anything away, but viewers seem to have different opinions about it, opinions which greatly influence their impression of the entire movie.  I thought it was brilliant and most fitting, a performance that Bette Davis would have been particularly proud of, but others bestow affections on a character I found completely unsympathetic and, as a result, apparently feel Julia's actions put her quite in the wrong.Through it all, we are treated to the insights of Julia's mentor (Michael Gambon), a man who has been dead for fifteen years.  I think this mentor's character, ethereal as he is, is of great benefit to the film, especially in terms of a prominent aspect of the story which centers on the peculiar confabulation of fantasy and reality on the part of an actress.

The movie is fresh, original and extremely witty, and puts me in mind of plays by Oscar Wilde.  I want to know why Annette Benning did not receive more awards?Benning is absolutely wonderful.  For every woman who has had to deal with the over-eager ""up-and-comer"" who wants your job and ""she who would like to take your husband"" this film provides a great morale boost.  Sure, that makes it sound like the ""other"" film, but Annette (Julia) does not ride off into the sunset, or run away to Vermont with hubby to escape the clutches of the young upstart. No, she fights her using the best weapons she has -- cumulative experience and wisdom.Michael Gambon is 'Jimmy' a sort of guardian angel to Julia, always coaching her to do her best and pointing out where she could improve. I take it that Jimmy was her Director at some time in the past when she was first learning to act, and is either now deceased (they speak of him in the past tense) or moved onto greener pastures (or both).This is the best Jeremy Irons film in since 'Brideshead'. No more the callow youth, he always does his best as a cad these days.I don't often buy DVD films of regular moves -- preferring instead to rent from Netflix or purchase BBC productions of old tv series -- but am making an exception with Julia.

Jeremy Irons was suave and debonaire,and probably the best thing in the movie, but even his part was fairly slight.

880524,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0007G89FK,Ed Uyeshima,"[0, 0]","This lightweight period comedy provides further proof that Annette Bening is a terrifically engrossing actress. Ever since she burst onto the scene in ""Valmont"" and ""The Grifters"" fifteen years ago, she has managed to turn in superlative performances in movies both provocative (""American Beauty"") and pitiable (""Love Affair""). Directed by Istv&aacute;n Szab&oacute; and written by Ronald Harwood (based on W. Somerset Maugham's ""Theater""), this one is somewhere in between, but Bening is on fire. She portrays Julia Lambert, a 1930's West End stage legend at the peak of her career. As a member of the same sorority as Margo Channing and Norma Desmond, she has been manufactured to chew scenery in an ocean-deep pool of self-doubt. Bening carries this excessive star persona confidently with her throaty voice, impeccable British accent  and grande dame manner, but she also manages moments of surprising poignancy as her character's insecurity takes over. This is indisputably stellar work.Of course, high maintenance Julia makes life quite challenging for those around her, which includes Michael, her elegantly detached husband and stage director; Evie, her longtime, no-nonsense dresser; Lord Charles, her suave and unattainable admirer; and Avice, a nakedly ambitious actress who apparently went to the Eve Harrington School of Dramatic Arts. Luckily, Jeremy Irons, Juliet Stevenson, Bruce Greenwood and newcomer Lucy Punch play these respective roles expertly. Punch is especially animated in a role that treads on caricature. Even Michael Gambon shows up as the ghost of her long-dead mentor providing critiques of her behavior onstage and off. The one glaring disappointment is Shaun Evans, who is rather uninteresting and incapable of displaying the hypocrisy of Tom, her young, immoral American lover. He is far too dull to captivate the likes of Julia. Smaller roles are filled out nicely by the dependable Miriam Margolyes as the giddy, overadmiring patron, Rosemary Harris as Julia's mother and in an all-too-rare screen appearance, Rita Tushingham (""A Taste of Honey"", ""Doctor Zhivago"") as her Aunt Carrie.The first three-quarters of the film are entertaining even when the story takes fairly predictable turns. However, the last twenty minutes of the movie are rather over-the-top, when Julia exacts her theatrical revenge on those who betrayed her, and the play being performed hardly seems praiseworthy.  Worth noting are the evocative period interiors filmed in Szab&oacute;'s native Budapest. The DVD includes informative though sporadic and overly polite commentary by Szab&oacute;, Bening and Irons on an alternate track. There are two brief featurettes, one just a series of shots of the filming and the other more promotional in nature, as well as a few deleted scenes.",4,"A Truly Stellar Bening in Wavering ""All About Eve"" Redux",1118188800,"06 8, 2005",2005,2793,"['lightweight', 'period', 'comedy', 'further', 'proof', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'terrifically', 'engrossing', 'actress', 'Ever', 'scene', 'Valmont', 'Grifters', 'fifteen', 'years', 'ago', 'managed', 'turn', 'superlative', 'performances', 'movies', 'provocative', 'American', 'Beauty', 'pitiable', 'Love', 'Affair', 'Directed', 'Istv', 'aacute', 'Szab', 'oacute', 'written', 'Ronald', 'Harwood', 'based', 'W.', 'Somerset', 'Maugham', 'Theater', 'one', 'somewhere', 'Bening', 'fire', 'Julia', 'Lambert', '1930', 'West', 'End', 'stage', 'legend', 'peak', 'career', 'member', 'same', 'sorority', 'Margo', 'Channing', 'Norma', 'Desmond', 'been', 'manufactured', 'chew', 'scenery', 'ocean-deep', 'pool', 'self-doubt', 'Bening', 'excessive', 'star', 'persona', 'confidently', 'throaty', 'voice', 'impeccable', 'British', 'accent', 'grande', 'dame', 'manner', 'also', 'moments', 'surprising', 'poignancy', 'character', 'insecurity', 'over', 'indisputably', 'stellar', 'work.Of', 'course', 'high', 'maintenance', 'Julia', 'life', 'quite', 'challenging', 'Michael', 'elegantly', 'detached', 'husband', 'stage', 'director', 'Evie', 'longtime', 'no-nonsense', 'dresser', 'Lord', 'Charles', 'suave', 'unattainable', 'admirer', 'Avice', 'nakedly', 'ambitious', 'actress', 'who', 'apparently', 'went', 'Eve', 'Harrington', 'School', 'Dramatic', 'Arts', 'Luckily', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'Juliet', 'Stevenson', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'newcomer', 'Lucy', 'Punch', 'play', 'respective', 'roles', 'expertly', 'Punch', 'especially', 'animated', 'role', 'caricature', 'Even', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'up', 'ghost', 'long-dead', 'mentor', 'providing', 'critiques', 'behavior', 'onstage', 'off', 'one', 'glaring', 'disappointment', 'Shaun', 'Evans', 'who', 'rather', 'uninteresting', 'incapable', 'displaying', 'hypocrisy', 'Tom', 'young', 'immoral', 'American', 'lover', 'far', 'too', 'dull', 'captivate', 'likes', 'Julia', 'Smaller', 'roles', 'are', 'filled', 'out', 'nicely', 'dependable', 'Miriam', 'Margolyes', 'giddy', 'overadmiring', 'patron', 'Rosemary', 'Harris', 'Julia', 'mother', 'all-too-rare', 'screen', 'appearance', 'Rita', 'Tushingham', 'Taste', 'Honey', 'Doctor', 'Zhivago', 'Aunt', 'Carrie.The', 'first', 'three-quarters', 'film', 'are', 'entertaining', 'even', 'when', 'story', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'turns', 'However', 'last', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'movie', 'are', 'rather', 'over-the-top', 'when', 'Julia', 'theatrical', 'revenge', 'who', 'betrayed', 'play', 'being', 'performed', 'hardly', 'praiseworthy', 'noting', 'are', 'evocative', 'period', 'interiors', 'filmed', 'Szab', 'oacute', 'native', 'Budapest', 'DVD', 'informative', 'sporadic', 'overly', 'polite', 'commentary', 'Szab', 'oacute', 'Bening', 'Irons', 'alternate', 'track', 'are', 'two', 'brief', 'featurettes', 'one', 'just', 'series', 'shots', 'filming', 'other', 'more', 'promotional', 'nature', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'deleted', 'scenes']",N/A

The movie is based on a novel written in 1937 by W. Somerset Maugham: Theatre.Julia Lambert is the greatest actress in England; recognized and admired by art lovers. Her plays are scheduled for many weeks at a time. On stage she is professional and forgets the reality of the outside world, making her plays the reality of the moment.But... she is bored, she has lost the energy and romance in the relationship she shares with her husband, played by Jeremy Irons. One day, a rather young male visits this couple and Julia finds in his admiration of her the elements she missed and soon she is involved with this young man in a rather destructive relationship, for while she thinks she loves him, he is only using her to advance his career, to penetrate the walls that protect high society, and to extract the money he needs to live beyond his means. At first she satisfies her vanity, then she is thrilled by the renewed sexual passion and finally, she is hurt beyond her expectations.They go on a vacation and the young man accompanies Julia and her husband, who are also joined by their son. As with all marital deception, the person committing adultery soon finds that they are jealous of any relationship partner because they fear the same happening to them, and Julia becomes rather jealous of a young woman who becomes involved with the young American, played by Shaun Evans.The play turns rather interesting because the young woman is also using the rather shy, but by now, rather arrogant lover. All she wants is to be selected to become part of Julia's new theatre play.

Based on a story by W. Somerset Maugham (author of ""The Letter""), the film is set in London of the 1930s just after Prime Minister Chamberlain had declared that there would be ""peace in our time.""This entire delicious concoction is under the brilliant direction of Istvan Szabo. The production, however, would not have been so magnificently authentic without the design of Lucianna Arrighi (who deservedly won an Academy Award for ""Howard's End"", and also designed ""Remains of the Day"" and ""Anna and the King""). Arrighi has created the atmosphere of the thirties down to the last art deco knife and fork. Arrighi's sets sweep us back to that elegant era before the world lost its innocence.Julia, so beautifully acted by Annette Bening, is a pampered, self-absorbed leading lady of the West-End Stage. Bored with her own success as well as her less-than-successful marriage to her impresario-husband (the always-suave Jeremy Irons), she is drawn into an affair with a brash, young and unscrupulous American, just graduated from Yale, and in London in order to move upwards as fast as possible.

She is the toast of the theater world and at the peak of her career in 1938. Ms. Lambert plays to a full-house nightly and fans enthusiastically acclaim her performances. Admirers applaud when she enters restaurants. She, however, is bored. Life lacks verve. Julia complains to longtime husband, ex-actor Michael Gosselyn, (Jeremy Irons), who is also her business manager and director, ""Everything's so tedious. I want something to happen."" Underneath it all, Julia realizes she will soon be over-the-hill and the prime roles will dwindle.Then she meets Tom Fennel, (Shaun Evans), a young American accountant only a few years older than her son, who is wild about her. He manages to wangle an introduction and then seduces her over tea at his tiny flat. The verve is back. Bigtime! Julia blooms with all the attention, flattery and, yes, passionate sex. She and hubby Michael have had a platonic, but loving relationship for years, and an ""open marriage."" The two are a devoted couple, however, as Michael says, they are not ""possessive."" He understands his wife very well, and realizes she is in the midst of an affair. He also knows that her burgeoning love-life is enhancing her acting performance, which is good for business. And business comes first!Julia's life has been about acting, performing, seemingly forever. And she is always on - always acting, onstage and off. Her mentor, Jimmie Langton, (Michael Gambon), taught her that ""real life does not exist."" Langton, long dead, is terrific with his ghostly appearances, giving Julia hell for overacting, and signaling a thumbs-up when she succeeds. Roger, (Tom Sturridge), her teenage son tells her, ""You've got a performance for everyone. I don't think you really exist. Once you said something to me, and then you said the same thing on stage that night. Even the things you say are second hand."" I found myself trying to discover who the real Julia was, and wondering if a real Julia existed.Meanwhile, Tom, cannot afford to keep wining and dining Julia, so she picks up the bills. Increasingly more enamored of him, she begins to buy him expensive presents. Ahhh, the callow youth is a cad....he also turns out to be...no, no spoilers here. There's also an ambitious young actress, quite lovely, talented and ruthless, (Lucy Punch), who would just love to step into Julia's shoes. The payback, at the conclusion, is really amazing - a terrific finale worthy of a standing ovation!Ms. Benning is luminous and truly charismatic as Julia. The film is her vehicle and all other characters take a back seat. Which is not a bad thing. Annette Benning more than carries her own weight and seems to adore every minute, every line and every close-up. The supporting cast is excellent, even with their much smaller roles. Juliet Stevenson is fantastic as Julia's dresser, and the extraordinary Rita Tushingham has a bit part as the aunt who lives on the Isle of Jersey.

880532,A2RZUFRYRHTRS8,B0007G89FK,jasoneducator,"[10, 11]","With the Oscar buzz for Annette Benning and its focus on the theatre, I felt that this movie would end up being a deep drama. Instead, it was more of a farce and a clever exploration of how acting an alter one's personality.Annette Benning's character, Julia, is an accomplished actress who wrestles with boredom while seeking to escape age and the potential diminishing of her powers. She needs her status as a grand actress even as she is bored by that status and wonders what will become of her should she lose her youth. Early in the movie, she throws a tantrum and demands that her husband end the run of ""Farewell My Love"" that she stars in. But a young American appears on the scene and she begins an affair seeking to capture her lost youth.For me, the movie was hard to care about at first. Mostly, this was because I had a hard time rooting for any of the characters to succeed. Nobody seemed to be a postive presence. Julia? Didn't dig her, too entitled. The American? Quickly becomes transparent as a gold digger, and not a good one at that. Her husband? Emotionally unavailable and probably the cause of some of Julia's frustration. Plus, the movie uses Julia's old acting teacher as a quasi ghost who appears to her and comments on her real life performances. I found this device tiring at times.But the movie takes off as you realize that Julia is aware that she is being duped. She does begin to have some degree of self-awareness. I do not wish to give away the ending, but I feel that ultimately, ""Being Julia"" succeeds because it raises very real questions about the nature of acting. Do we act when we put on a performance in our social lives? Are we really acting on stage when we draw upon true events from our real lives for inspiration? As a performer and a musician, those questions led me to think about these characters deeply and I was ultimately glad that I gave this movie a chance.Be patient with this one, but I still think it's worth the ride.3.5 stars--SD",3,Just how should one grow old?,1132444800,"11 20, 2005",2005,1989,"['Oscar', 'buzz', 'Annette', 'Benning', 'focus', 'theatre', 'felt', 'movie', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'deep', 'drama', 'Instead', 'was', 'more', 'farce', 'clever', 'exploration', 'how', 'acting', 'alter', 'one', 'personality.Annette', 'Benning', 'character', 'Julia', 'accomplished', 'actress', 'who', 'boredom', 'seeking', 'escape', 'age', 'potential', 'diminishing', 'powers', 'status', 'grand', 'actress', 'even', 'bored', 'status', 'wonders', 'what', 'will', 'become', 'should', 'lose', 'youth', 'Early', 'movie', 'tantrum', 'husband', 'end', 'run', 'Farewell', 'My', 'Love', 'young', 'American', 'scene', 'affair', 'seeking', 'capture', 'lost', 'youth.For', 'movie', 'was', 'hard', 'care', 'about', 'first', 'Mostly', 'was', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'rooting', 'characters', 'succeed', 'Nobody', 'seemed', 'be', 'postive', 'presence', 'Julia', 'Did', ""n't"", 'dig', 'too', 'entitled', 'American', 'Quickly', 'transparent', 'gold', 'digger', 'not', 'good', 'one', 'husband', 'Emotionally', 'unavailable', 'probably', 'cause', 'Julia', 'frustration', 'movie', 'Julia', 'old', 'acting', 'teacher', 'quasi', 'ghost', 'who', 'comments', 'real', 'life', 'performances', 'found', 'device', 'tiring', 'movie', 'off', 'realize', 'Julia', 'aware', 'being', 'duped', 'begin', 'have', 'degree', 'self-awareness', 'do', 'not', 'wish', 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'feel', 'ultimately', 'Being', 'Julia', 'very', 'real', 'questions', 'nature', 'acting', 'Do', 'act', 'when', 'put', 'performance', 'social', 'lives', 'Are', 'really', 'acting', 'stage', 'when', 'draw', 'true', 'events', 'real', 'lives', 'inspiration', 'performer', 'musician', 'questions', 'led', 'think', 'characters', 'deeply', 'was', 'ultimately', 'glad', 'gave', 'movie', 'chance.Be', 'patient', 'one', 'still', 'think', 'ride.3.5', 'stars', 'SD']",N/A

880535,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B0007G89FK,Joe Sherry,"[1, 3]","""Being Julia"" is really only notable as a film because it is the movie which garnered Annette Bening an Oscar nominee to once again pit her against Hilary Swank in the category of Best Actress in something of a rematch of the 1999 Academy Awards when Swank won the Oscar for her performance in ""Boys Don't Cry"".  Once again Bening was nominated against Swank and once again Swank won, this time for ""Million Dollar Baby"".  This time Bening was nominated, I think, as much for her performance as for the fact that Bening was playing her own age.  As an actress this seems to be fairly rare in a lead performance.  Julia Lambert (Bening) is an aging star of the theatre in 1930's London.  She is concerned that she is starting to look old because she is certainly feeling it.  She is tired, ready for a vacation, but a star can't just shut down a show and take a vacation.  Her husband and theatre manager Michael (Jeremy Irons) says that he will try to shut down the show if possible, but also introduces her to a young American named Tom Fennel (Shaun Evans).Julia and Tom have an affair and it is like Julia is coming to life again.  She has more passion in her acting and feels no need of a vacation.  For this movie to have any sort of conflict, of course, things do not go smoothly and Julia's reactions are of course that of an actress.  I think this is part of the joy of Bening's performance and part of the reason she picked up the nomination.  She delightfully and perfectly overacts as Julia Lambert.  I'm not sure that I buy the climax scene near the end of the picture, but Bening is so perfect in just barely overplaying the role that the humor in the situation comes clear and out into the open.As the movie progressed I was more and more impressed with Annette Bening.  I've always liked her as an actress, but this was just delightful.  Hilary Swank still deserved the Academy Award over Bening for this role, but Bening was just charming and devious as Julia.  The funny thing, though, is that I find myself talking more about Bening and her performance than I am about the movie.  There's a reason for that.  As a movie, as a film telling a story it is completely ordinary and if not for Bening this movie would be forgotten even quicker than I suspect it already will be.The other bit of performance of note is Michael Gambon.  Gambon, in a role which he also seems to overact just a little bit (but again, in a perfectly delightful way), is wonderful here.  Exactly why his character is in the movie should come clear deeper into the movie, but I looked forward to Gambon as much as Bening.The bottom line is that the movie itself is not very impressing, but Bening and Gambon are worth watching the movie for.  After a while the plot, which is rather silly, faded to the background with the star, Annette Bening standing front and center.  I think that was the point here and it worked.Grade: B (B for Bening).-Joe Sherry",3,It's all about Bening,1118361600,"06 10, 2005",2005,2942,"['Being', 'Julia', 'really', 'only', 'notable', 'film', 'movie', 'garnered', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'once', 'again', 'pit', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'category', 'Best', 'Actress', 'something', 'rematch', '1999', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'when', 'Swank', 'won', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'Boys', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', 'Once', 'again', 'Bening', 'was', 'nominated', 'Swank', 'once', 'again', 'Swank', 'won', 'time', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'time', 'Bening', 'was', 'nominated', 'think', 'much', 'performance', 'fact', 'Bening', 'was', 'playing', 'own', 'age', 'actress', 'be', 'fairly', 'rare', 'lead', 'performance', 'Julia', 'Lambert', 'Bening', 'aging', 'star', 'theatre', '1930', 'London', 'concerned', 'starting', 'look', 'old', 'certainly', 'feeling', 'tired', 'ready', 'vacation', 'star', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'shut', 'down', 'show', 'take', 'vacation', 'husband', 'theatre', 'manager', 'Michael', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'will', 'try', 'shut', 'down', 'show', 'possible', 'also', 'young', 'American', 'named', 'Tom', 'Fennel', 'Shaun', 'Evans', '.Julia', 'Tom', 'have', 'affair', 'Julia', 'coming', 'life', 'again', 'more', 'passion', 'acting', 'need', 'vacation', 'movie', 'have', 'sort', 'conflict', 'course', 'things', 'do', 'not', 'go', 'smoothly', 'Julia', 'reactions', 'are', 'course', 'actress', 'think', 'part', 'joy', 'Bening', 'performance', 'part', 'reason', 'picked', 'up', 'nomination', 'delightfully', 'perfectly', 'overacts', 'Julia', 'Lambert', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'buy', 'climax', 'scene', 'end', 'picture', 'Bening', 'so', 'perfect', 'just', 'barely', 'overplaying', 'role', 'humor', 'situation', 'clear', 'out', 'open.As', 'movie', 'progressed', 'was', 'more', 'more', 'impressed', 'Annette', 'Bening', ""'ve"", 'always', 'liked', 'actress', 'was', 'just', 'delightful', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'still', 'deserved', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Bening', 'role', 'Bening', 'was', 'just', 'charming', 'devious', 'Julia', 'funny', 'thing', 'find', 'talking', 'more', 'Bening', 'performance', 'am', 'movie', 'reason', 'movie', 'film', 'telling', 'story', 'completely', 'ordinary', 'not', 'Bening', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'forgotten', 'even', 'quicker', 'suspect', 'already', 'will', 'be.The', 'other', 'bit', 'performance', 'note', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'Gambon', 'role', 'also', 'overact', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'again', 'perfectly', 'delightful', 'way', 'wonderful', 'here', 'Exactly', 'why', 'character', 'movie', 'should', 'come', 'clear', 'deeper', 'movie', 'looked', 'forward', 'Gambon', 'as', 'much', 'Bening.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'movie', 'not', 'very', 'impressing', 'Bening', 'Gambon', 'are', 'worth', 'watching', 'movie', 'plot', 'rather', 'silly', 'faded', 'background', 'star', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'standing', 'front', 'center', 'think', 'was', 'point', 'here', 'worked.Grade', 'B', 'B', 'Bening', '.-Joe', 'Sherry']",N/A

Bernabo,"[1, 2]","About halfway through ""Being Julia"" it becomes clear to you that famous but aging actress Julia Lambert (Annette Bening) is setting up something and you start wondering what it is going to be.  How much you like this 2004 film from director Istv&aacute;n Szab&oacute; based on W. Somerset Maugham's minor novel ""Theater,"" will depend on how much you like the payoff for the setup, and, of course, Bening's Oscar nominated performance.  But it could also depend on whether you manage to make it through the first half, which spends too long setting the stage for the theatrical fireworks at the end.Set in London before the Second World War, ""Being Julia"" focuses on the title character who is now playing a woman half her age in a success play.  Her performances have become meaningless repetition and so has her marriage to director Michael Gaslin (Jeremy Irons).  Now, even her lover, Lord Charles (Bruce Greenwood) has moved on.  The only thing she has going for her is that she is haunted, so to speak, by her old drama teacher (Michael Gambon), who has the virtues of not taking her seriously and telling her the truth, usually phrased in lurid and colorful ways.Julia's response to this ennui is to have an affair with a young American, Tom Fennell (Shaun Evans).  Her husband is aware but says nothing, apparently hoping it will help her performances, which will in turn help his pocketbook.  However, when Tom's girlfriend, the young actress Avie Crichton (Lucy Punch), becomes part of the picture Julia starts to lose it.  Desperate to start a new play as a way of keeping her position in the world of theater, she finds out that Avie will be in it as well and has scene that will make her reputation, perhaps as the ""next Julia.""  It is at this point that Julia starts making suggestions to build up Avie's performance.  Avie is grateful, Michael is surprised, and we are wary.  What is Julia up to?The bad news is that we are roughly an hour into the film before we become interested in the actual story and not just in watching Bening's performance and listening to Gambon's creative insults.  I am perfectly willing to grant that the ending is over the top, but then so is Bening's Julia, so it is hard to complain on that score.

Julia has come a long way, having started her stage career in provincial theatre, where she was discovered and mentored by Jimmy Langton (Michael Gambon), dead for at least fifteen years. Julia is now the reigning diva of the London stage and has been married for well over twenty years to her business manager, the handsome and debonair Michael Gosselyn (Jeremy Irons). Alas, she has lost her spark. Her performances weary her, and her marriage has sunk into platonic complacency. She needs something to energize her.Then, along comes a young and handsome, ardent admirer, Tom Fennell (Shaun Evans), who is about the same age as Julia's son, Rupert (Michael Culkin). Tom Fennel wastes little time in making his intentions known, and before she knows it, Julia is having an affair with him. Believing herself in love with the feckless and boyish Tom, giving him expensive gifts and lending him money, she is jealous when his attentions seem to stray to a young blonde, would be actress, Avice Crichton. Apparently, the young actress wants a part in Julia's new play, and she pressures Tom to help her get a part. When Julia discovers that she has made a fool of herself six ways to Sunday, she decides to give the performance of her life and exacts a revenge that will leave no one in doubt about who is in charge of her destiny.Annette Bening is wonderful in the part of Julia and totally riveting as the self-absorbed diva that finally manages to come to terms with herself. She also manages a totally believable upper class British accent. Jeremy Irons is wonderful as the understanding husband with peccadilloes of his own for which to account. Shaun Evans is excellent as the coltish but self-seeking Tom Fennel. I was floored to discover that he was not American, as he really has the American accent down pat. Lucy Punch is excellent as the pretty, young actress who has no qualms about the proverbial casting couch and gets a comeuppance that she will never forget. Michael Gambon is terrific as Jimmy Langton who, although long dead, appears on screen giving Julia advice that helps prop her up along the way, as she faces some unpleasant consequences of her actions. Of course, there is Julia Stevenson in the role of Evie, Julia's long time companion and dresser. This is an actress under appreciated by American audiences. While no great beauty, she is, undoubtedly, a great actress.This is a film in which no expense seemed to have been spared. It boasts a stellar cast, as well as deft direction by Istvan Szabo. The performances are first rate, and the film has beautiful period sets and costumes. It is a film, however, that while entertaining is eminently forgettable. None of the major characters are particularly likable, as they are shallow and self-absorbed for the most part.

The deleted scene in the DVD where Bening is sitting in the empty theatre contemplating the coming performance, audience, and magic of the theatre is one of the truest moments.  All of the petty bickering, one-ups-manship and the backstage gossip that are part of the politics of the theatre are as real as they might seem trivial to one unfamiliar with the experience.  While it is undoubtedly a delightful comedy, this show is quite true-to-life with regard to the theatre.Hungarian director Istvan Szabo has done an excellent job with this English project.  The pacing of the film and unfolding of events are done masterfully.  The subject of this film is also the theatre, as it was opera with Glenn Close's Venus project that he directed.  Based on W. Somerset Maugham's short story, the plot is basically a love triangle that climaxes onstage.Annette Bening is such a delightful actress.  With three Oscar nominations [The Grifters (1990) & American Beauty (1999)], we can only hope she finds her deserved moment of recognition.  She won my own personal award for the amazingly underrated ""Open Range"" in 2003.  As Juliet Lambert, we see what appears to be a superficial actress whose life is so vacant that she often uses rehearsed dialog in her personal life as a substitute for real emotions.  Jeremy Irons telegraphs in a good performance as the her manager husband.  Newcomer Shaun Evans in his 2nd feature role does a great job as the outwardly sedate Tom Fennel who is emphatuated with Julia.  Julia's theatre mentor Jimmie Langton is played by Michael Gambon who also starred with her in ""Open Range"" and most recently took over for Richard Harris as Dumbledore in ""Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban.""  As her ""theatre conscience"" he plays the pivotal task of cheering her on to bring out her performance best.  Bruce Greenwood from ""Racing Stripes"" breezes in & out as Lord Charles, the gay friend.  Part of the magic of the film is that all of the supporting roles are so well played.  As Julia's assistant Evie, Juliet Stevenson (Mona Lisa's Smile) does a marvelous job.  Miriam Margolyes who was delightful in ""Little Dorrit,"" worked with Szabo on ""Sunshine"" & played Professor Sprout in ""Harry Potter & the Chamber of Secrets,"" does a great job as the busybody theatre owner Dolly DeVries.  Tom Sturridge does a nice job as Julia's son Roger as does Lucy Punch in the bewildered  star-struck Avice Crichton.""Being Julia"" was a sheer delight.

I wasn't even anxious to see it on DVD.  But I'm sure glad I did.  Because this film made me change my mind about her.  She's a fine actor and her performance was absolutely great.Set in the 1930s, Ms. Bening is cast as Julia, an aging stage actress.  Jeremy Irons is her husband and the two of them understand each other.  That's why, when she begins an affair with a much younger man, he makes believe he doesn't notice.  All this is great fun for her until the young man discards her and even winds up recommending his new lady love for a part in Julia's play.  Julia has been devastated because of the breakup of their affair and it seems strange that she embraces the idea. and even encourages her husband to hire the new young lady.And then, just when the audience is all involved in the drama of Julia stepping back to give the young woman a chance, Julia, in true theatrical tradition, upstages the young woman right on stage.  It's a great moment of revenge.  And I found myself applauding.I loved this film, which is based on a novel by Somerset Maugham.  I loved all the twists and turns.  And, mostly, I loved the fact that the ending was non-traditional and that the older woman was a winner in this case.All the acting was terrific and so was the directing.

In fact, all the actors did a fabulous job in portraying their characters.Unfortunately, I found the film to have parts that were bland and uneven.  I had to watch it in three different sittings because at times I became very bored.  The premise is that Julia Lambert, a diva of the stage, spends her entire adulthood playing a role.  She never has an original thought; everything she says is from one of her plays.  She has an affair with a much younger man who is having an affair with a young woman (in a play with Julia) who is having an affair with Julia's husband (played very well by Jeremy Irons).  The fireworks begin when Julia decides to become original for once while having her comeuppance!BEING JULIA was a mildly entertaining film that I enjoyed viewing.

Julia has money and fame, but she wants a holiday from the theatre and her husband Michael Gosselyn (Jeremy Irons), who is at the same her manager. However, all her boredom vanishes quickly when she plunges into an affair with an attractive young American, Tom Fennel (Shaun Evans). She is 45 and he is in his twenties, but they have an exhilarating affair, for a while.Unfortunately, there are lots of beautiful young actresses in 1930's London, and Tom meets one of them, Avice Crichton (Lucy Punch). Avice is an ambitious young actress, and manages to get a part in Julia's new play thanks to the intervention of a lovesick Tom. But will Julia let bygones be bygones in her relationship with Tom, or will she take revenge in her turf when Avice goes to far in her quest for stardom?. Watch ""Being Julia"", and enjoy the show :)Of course, there is much more to this film that what I have told you, but that is the gist of the plot. Other secondary characters that bring even more life to ""Being Julia"" are Julia's son, Roger (Tom Sturridge), her personal maid Evie (Juliet Stevenson), and her friend, Lord Charles (Bruce Greenwood). But probably the most important secondary character is Jimmie Langton (Michael Gambon), Julia's erstwhile mentor, who happens to be dead but nonetheless peppers the movie with his advice to Julia. His opinion was, and continues to be, of the utmost importance to Julia. Jimmie was, after all, the one who told her that ""Your only reality is the theatre"".All in all, I can sincerely say that I found this movie delightful, and that I'll keep an open eye for future films by its director, Istvan Szabo.

She plays Julia Lambert, a 40-something London stage actress who undergoes a midlife crisis when she gets swept off her feet and has a fling with an American employee of her producer/director husband (Jeremy Irons) -- who is half her age. The kid is a cad, of course, and Julia eventually has her heart broken -- and then decides on a particularly delicious revenge, involving the kid, her husband (with whom she has an ""understanding""), and the young blonde actress wannabe with whom both the men are having separate affairs. There's a lot of pathos and romance and sad reality, but the film is basically a serious comedy.

880561,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B0007G89FK,RMurray847,"[2, 2]","BEING JULIA achieved what little publicity it did purely by virtue of the praise (and Oscar nomination) heaped on the performance of Annette Bening.  She certainly earned the accolades.  This is probably her best performance, in a career with several other great turns.  But it's a true leading role...she doesn't ""co-star"" with Kevin Spacey or Warren Beatty or Angelica Huston. Here, everyone supports her.Bening plays Julia, a major star of British theater in the time before World War II.  She's such a huge star that she pretty much has her own theater, and just cranks out one starring role after another.  Her husband, playing drolly by Jeremy Irons, manages the affairs of the theater, and the two only share a love of her career in common.  Probably there was once love between them, but now its mostly frazzled affection.  Bening is also an actress ""of a certain age.""  She's still a handsome woman, but it's getting a bit ridiculous for her to play young women anymore.Bored and a bit anxious about her status, Julia falls into a passionate (but superficial) affair with a young American admirer.  At first, her beau seems to be nave, innocent and completely in her thrall.  But of course, he has his own schemes that he is working on.  Schemes which aren't to the benefit of Julia.Julia, once bored, but now newly invigorated by life and by a desire to be the undisputed queen of theater once again, launches into a delightful plot of her own, requiring her to give quite an acting performance in real life, as well as on stage.  We have no doubt she will succeed, and it's fun watching her go to work.BEING JULIA is a delightful period piece.  It is light and fluffy, too.  There is pretty much nothing that should be taken seriously in the piece.  The characters are all quirky and masterfully played.  We get a great look into the overwrought acting style that was considered great acting back in the first part of the 20th Century.  And we get to see Annette Bening having the time of her life.  She just pops off the screen in all her scenes.  While everyone around her does a very nice job...the film is HERS.  Although Julia is someone that would be very frustrating to meet in real life...we love her character and story at the arms length offered by the movie.The film moves at a leisurely pace, and no doubt would bore many moviegoers.  It certainly would help to have a love of the theater.  Certainly an appreciation of ""British period pieces"" would help too...ROOM WITH A VIEW, SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, etc.  Those films are meatier and loftier, but BEING JULIA requires the same sort of attention to the subtleties  of the developing plot to be properly enjoyed.My only real complaints are minor, but I'll trot them out anyway.  Michael Gambon plays the ""ghost"" of Julia's old acting instructor.  He's a figure that comes to her in moments of crisis (not really a ghost, just Julia imagining what her old mentor/father-figure would say to her), and he spouts  bits of acting tips to her, meant to help  her get through real-life problems.  The device falls flat, in my opinion.  I'm sure some like it, but to me, Gambon's dialogue is spewed out at such a rapid pace, and his  mood is often in conflict with the mood Julia is in, that I often couldn't really ""get"" the point he was trying to make.  Also, the acting style portrayed here is SO over-the-top for our modern sensibilities that it becomes difficult to tell if someone is ""good"" or ""bad.""  I'll watch a scene and think, ""okay, that acting stinks"" and then all the characters are sincerely praising it.  Later, they seem to dislike a performance that for all the world seems virtually the same.  It's a bit jarring at first, when you're trying to decide if Julia really is a good actress, or if people just love her out of force of habit.  These quibbles don't detract from the overall enjoyment.If you're a movie-viewer willing to go at a slower pace, and interested in subtle comedy (with no raucus laughs), then BEING JULIA might be a real find for you.",4,"Delightful, especially for theatre buffs",1113868800,"04 19, 2005",2005,4038,"['BEING', 'JULIA', 'achieved', 'what', 'little', 'publicity', 'did', 'purely', 'virtue', 'praise', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'heaped', 'performance', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'certainly', 'earned', 'accolades', 'probably', 'best', 'performance', 'career', 'several', 'other', 'great', 'turns', 'true', 'leading', 'role', ""n't"", 'co-star', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Warren', 'Beatty', 'Angelica', 'Huston', 'Here', 'everyone', 'supports', 'her.Bening', 'plays', 'Julia', 'major', 'star', 'British', 'theater', 'time', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'such', 'huge', 'star', 'pretty', 'much', 'own', 'theater', 'just', 'cranks', 'out', 'one', 'starring', 'role', 'husband', 'playing', 'drolly', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'affairs', 'theater', 'two', 'only', 'share', 'love', 'career', 'common', 'Probably', 'was', 'once', 'love', 'now', 'mostly', 'frazzled', 'affection', 'Bening', 'also', 'actress', 'certain', 'age', 'still', 'handsome', 'woman', 'getting', 'bit', 'ridiculous', 'play', 'young', 'women', 'anymore.Bored', 'bit', 'anxious', 'status', 'Julia', 'passionate', 'superficial', 'affair', 'young', 'American', 'admirer', 'first', 'beau', 'be', 'nave', 'innocent', 'completely', 'thrall', 'course', 'own', 'schemes', 'working', 'Schemes', 'are', ""n't"", 'benefit', 'Julia.Julia', 'once', 'bored', 'now', 'newly', 'invigorated', 'life', 'desire', 'be', 'undisputed', 'queen', 'theater', 'once', 'again', 'delightful', 'plot', 'own', 'requiring', 'give', 'quite', 'acting', 'performance', 'real', 'life', 'as', 'well', 'stage', 'have', 'doubt', 'will', 'succeed', 'fun', 'watching', 'go', 'work.BEING', 'JULIA', 'delightful', 'period', 'piece', 'light', 'fluffy', 'too', 'pretty', 'much', 'nothing', 'should', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'piece', 'characters', 'are', 'quirky', 'masterfully', 'played', 'get', 'great', 'look', 'overwrought', 'acting', 'style', 'was', 'considered', 'great', 'acting', 'back', 'first', 'part', '20th', 'Century', 'get', 'see', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'having', 'time', 'life', 'just', 'pops', 'off', 'screen', 'scenes', 'everyone', 'very', 'nice', 'job', 'film', 'HERS', 'Julia', 'someone', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'frustrating', 'meet', 'real', 'life', 'love', 'character', 'story', 'arms', 'length', 'offered', 'movie.The', 'film', 'moves', 'leisurely', 'pace', 'doubt', 'would', 'bore', 'many', 'moviegoers', 'certainly', 'would', 'help', 'have', 'love', 'theater', 'Certainly', 'appreciation', 'British', 'period', 'pieces', 'would', 'help', 'too', 'ROOM', 'WITH', 'A', 'VIEW', 'SENSE', 'AND', 'SENSIBILITY', 'etc', 'films', 'are', 'meatier', 'loftier', 'BEING', 'JULIA', 'same', 'sort', 'attention', 'subtleties', 'developing', 'plot', 'be', 'properly', 'enjoyed.My', 'only', 'real', 'complaints', 'are', 'minor', ""'ll"", 'trot', 'out', 'anyway', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'ghost', 'Julia', 'old', 'acting', 'instructor', 'figure', 'moments', 'crisis', 'not', 'really', 'ghost', 'just', 'Julia', 'imagining', 'what', 'old', 'mentor/father-figure', 'would', 'say', 'bits', 'acting', 'tips', 'meant', 'help', 'get', 'real-life', 'problems', 'device', 'flat', 'opinion', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Gambon', 'dialogue', 'spewed', 'out', 'rapid', 'pace', 'mood', 'often', 'conflict', 'mood', 'Julia', 'often', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'point', 'was', 'trying', 'make', 'Also', 'acting', 'style', 'portrayed', 'here', 'SO', 'over-the-top', 'modern', 'sensibilities', 'difficult', 'tell', 'someone', 'good', 'bad', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'scene', 'think', 'okay', 'acting', 'stinks', 'then', 'characters', 'are', 'sincerely', 'praising', 'Later', 'seem', 'dislike', 'performance', 'world', 'virtually', 'same', 'bit', 'jarring', 'first', 'when', ""'re"", 'trying', 'decide', 'Julia', 'really', 'good', 'actress', 'people', 'just', 'love', 'force', 'habit', 'quibbles', 'do', ""n't"", 'detract', 'overall', 'enjoyment.If', ""'re"", 'movie-viewer', 'willing', 'go', 'slower', 'pace', 'interested', 'subtle', 'comedy', 'raucus', 'then', 'BEING', 'JULIA', 'might', 'be', 'real', 'find']",N/A
880562,AO19QQOF7E2SX,B0007G89FK,roger,"[1, 2]","Old Jimmie Langdon, the impresario who taught the young Julia Langdon much of what she knows about the world, refers at one point to ""What civilians call the real world."" Theater people know better. All the world's a stage, and Julia is but a player on it. At one point, when she's asked for a loan, she replies with the same speech she used earlier in a play. Her marriage is ""in name only."" Even her extramarital affair is a performance; her lover, Lord Charles, finally confesses, ""I play for the other side."" Her son, Roger, says: ""You have a performance for everybody. I don't think you really exist.""In ""Being Julia,"" she departs from the playwright's lines and improvises a new closing act right there on the stage, and it's appropriate that her professional and personal problems should be resolved in front of an audience. Like Margo Channing, the Bette Davis character in ""All About Eve,"" Julia draws little distinction between her public and private selves. She lives to be on the stage, and when, at 45, she perceives that her star is dimming, she fights back with theatrical strategies.Annette Bening plays Julia in a performance that has great verve and energy, and just as well, because the basic material is wheezy melodrama. ""All About Eve"" (1950) breathed new life into it all those years ago, but now it's gasping again. The film is based on Theatre, a 1937 novel by W. Somerset Maugham that was not one of his few great works, and has been adapted by a director and a writer who have separately created much more important fictions about the theater. Istvan Szabo directed ""Mephisto,"" with its brilliant performance by Klaus Maria Brandauer as an actor who sells out to the Nazis to protect his career, and Ronald Harwood wrote ""The Dresser,"" one of the most knowledgeable of backstage plays.Here they all seem to have followed Maugham into a soap opera. Bening is fresh and alive (is there another actress who smiles and laughs so generously and naturally?), but she's surrounded by stock characters. Jeremy Irons plays her husband and producer, Michael, who turns a blind eye to her lover, Lord Charles (Bruce Greenwood), and why should he not, since Charles actually decides to break up with her because of all the gossip -- and isn't gossip surely the best reason to have an affair with an actress?They are all in the middle of an enormously successful play, but Julia has tired of it, complaining that the world is too much with her, she is weary and bored, she thinks she may retire. Circling her like moons, reflecting her light, are not only Michael and Charles but her loyal dresser Evie (Juliet Stevenson), her hopeful lesbian admirer Dolly (Miriam Margolyes), and the ghost of old Jimmie (Gambon), who advises for practical reasons that she sleep with her young leading man: ""If that doesn't improve your performance, then nothing will.""What happens instead is that she meets the callow young American theatrical accountant, Tom Fennel (Shaun Evans), a man as exciting as the seed after which he is named. He's seen all of her plays -- some of them three times! -- and Julia is flattered, not so much by his praise as by sex with a man half her age. In a world with few secrets, Lord Charles frets: ""I trust she doesn't tell the boy she loves him -- that's always fatal.""She sort of does and it sort of is, especially after the arrival of the young ingenue Avice Crichton (Lucy Punch), in the Eve Harrington role. Not only does Avice feel warmly toward Tom, but she also sparks interest in old Michael, Julia's husband, whose genitals may be able to revive for a farewell tour.All of this is fitfully entertaining, but it only seems to be happening for the first time to the Bening character. The others seem trapped in loops, as if they've traveled these cliches before. All comes to a head during rehearsals for a new play in which Avice seems to have better lines and staging than Julia. (""I'm going to give my all in this part!"" she gushes to Julia, who replies, ""Mustn't be a little spend-thrift."") It's by departing from the staging and the lines and improvising in an entirely different direction that Julia delivers Avice's comeuppance.But it doesn't happen that way in the theater. An actor may improvise a line or two, or a bit of business, or communicate in an occult way with the audience, or if he's Groucho Marx or Alfie even address us directly, but is it possible to improvise an entire act with the other actors on stage, and somehow incorporate them in such a way that they're not left standing there and gawking at you?I don't think so. I think the movie leads up to a denouement that would work only if the improvisation (as it is here) were carefully scripted and rehearsed. There's never the feeling that poor Avice is really out to sea, because even her discomfiture seems carefully blocked.I liked the movie in its own way, while it was cheerfully chugging along, but the ending let me down; the materials are past their sell-by date and were when Maugham first retailed them. The pleasures are in the actual presence of the actors, Bening most of all, and the droll Irons, and Juliet Stevenson as the practical aide-de-camp, and Thomas Sturridge, so good as Julia's son that I wonder why he wasn't given the role of her young lover.",3,the ending let me down,1111968000,"03 28, 2005",2005,5288,"['Old', 'Jimmie', 'Langdon', 'impresario', 'who', 'taught', 'young', 'Julia',

Hebbron ""S B H.""","[9, 9]","This film plays homage to the lost age of British stage Divas and a time (1930's) when film acting was still viewed with snobbishness and the stage was a world of riotously overbearing performers. Benning is perfectly cast in the lead and is every inch the slighty unhinged stage Goddess. Speaking as a Brit I also have to say that her accent is utterly perfect, it surpasses Rene Zelweiger in her Bridget Jones role; of whom it has to be said, did brilliantly.The film is very much the telling of a midlife crisis, coupled with the fear of fading stardom. The story takes place in the closing years of the 1930's, when European politics loomed large and cast an ugly shadow over British life. The story of Julia herself, is the life of a woman who has honed her craft of flambouyant acting so superbly, neither she, her social circle nor us as the audience is ever entirely sure of the boundry between real Julia and Julia the actress. Initially this pampered Madam is hilariously self-obsessed but learns to be more involved with her real world via a series of difficult events, her Son's coming of age and demands for honesty from his parents. An affair with an American fan who see's himself as Gigolo but is horrible out of his depth and the fight to remain No 1 in the face of competiton from a scheming young actress.Julia discovers much about the difference between selfish longing and cherishing what you already have in real time.Her journey leads to the ultimate performance in which she weaves all the strands of her personal struggle together along with settling a few scores and levelling some land. Benning is marvellous, givng a performance of sheer delight and carrying the film with ease, a chance she unfortunately gets all to rarely. She is supported well by a sterling cast of fine British actors including Irons as her stoic but slightly devious Husband, Margoleys as her gossip driven (and some might say, hopelessly smitten, lesbian friend).For me the shinning support comes from Gambon as the ever present, ghostly figure of her long dead mentor who guides her through life and stage performances.

880564,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,B0007G89FK,Westley,"[24, 24]","Annette Bening has one of her best roles as the aging stage star, Julia Lambert.  Set in 1938 London, the film follows Julia's exploits as she attempts to find some meaning in her drama-filled life.  Her relationship with her husband (Jeremy Irons) has always been ""open,"" so she decides to have a fling with a young American (Shaun Evans, who is actually English).  Unfortunately, what was meant to be a fun lark turns into something more serious, threatening to upset Julia's life completely, especially when the lovely young Avice Crichton (Judy Punch) enters the picture.  However, Julia is far too strong to become a second-string player in her own life, leading to some delicious retribution.""Being Julia"" is a very enjoyable movie with some spark and playfulness not always seen in period films.  Bening of course is quite stunning, and she brilliantly portrays her character's late-in-life personal growth.  She deservedly won a slew of acting awards for the role, including a Golden Globe (Best Actress - Musical or Comedy), and was nominated for an Oscar.  However, the entire cast is quite good, especially Miriam Margolyes and Juliet Stevenson.  The screenplay by celebrated writer Ronald Harwood (Oscar winner for ""The Pianist"") is solid, managing to balance some very nice comic moments with straight drama.  The script, incidentally, is based on W. Somerset Maugham's ""Theatre"" - I haven't read the book, but the movie was good enough that I want to read it soon.I often enjoy movies that take a peak behind the scenes of the theater world, and ""Being Julia"" is a solid addition to the genre.  Hungarian director Istvan Szabo has been in this territory before with the Glenn Close vehicle ""Meeting Venus.""  His work here is more accomplished than in that movie, but his direction still tends to be a bit clunky at times.  In particular, he sometimes directs scenes such that a laugh line is cut off somehow; the editing might be at fault in some cases though.  Overall though, ""Being Julia"" is a very good film that is likely to appeal to theater fans as well as viewers who enjoy period pieces.  Highly recommended.",4,"""I'm utterly exhausted and I need holiday.""",1119052800,"06 18, 2005",2005,2131,"['Annette', 'Bening', 'one', 'best', 'roles', 'aging', 'stage', 'star', 'Julia', 'Lambert', 'Set', '1938', 'London', 'film', 'Julia', 'exploits', 'find', 'meaning', 'drama-filled', 'life', 'relationship', 'husband', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'always', 'been', 'open', 'have', 'fling', 'young', 'American', 'Shaun', 'Evans', 'who', 'actually', 'English', 'Unfortunately', 'what', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'fun', 'lark', 'something', 'more', 'serious', 'threatening', 'upset', 'Julia', 'life', 'completely', 'especially', 'when', 'lovely', 'young', 'Avice', 'Crichton', 'Judy', 'Punch', 'picture', 'However', 'Julia', 'far', 'too', 'strong', 'become', 'second-string', 'player', 'own', 'life', 'leading', 'delicious', 'retribution', 'Being', 'Julia', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'spark', 'playfulness', 'not', 'always', 'seen', 'period', 'films', 'Bening', 'course', 'quite', 'stunning', 'brilliantly', 'character', 'late-in-life', 'personal', 'growth', 'deservedly', 'won', 'slew', 'acting', 'awards', 'role', 'including', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Musical', 'Comedy', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'However', 'entire', 'cast', 'quite', 'good', 'especially', 'Miriam', 'Margolyes', 'Juliet', 'Stevenson', 'screenplay', 'celebrated', 'writer', 'Ronald', 'Harwood', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Pianist', 'solid', 'managing', 'balance', 'very', 'nice', 'comic', 'moments', 'straight', 'drama', 'script', 'incidentally', 'based', 'W.', 'Somerset', 'Maugham', 'Theatre', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'want', 'read', 'soon.I', 'often', 'enjoy', 'movies', 'take', 'peak', 'scenes', 'theater', 'world', 'Being', 'Julia', 'solid', 'addition', 'genre', 'Hungarian', 'director', 'Istvan', 'Szabo', 'been', 'territory', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'vehicle', 'Meeting', 'Venus', 'work', 'here', 'more', 'accomplished', 'movie', 'direction', 'still', 'be', 'bit', 'clunky', 'times', 'particular', 'sometimes', 'scenes', 'such', 'laugh', 'line', 'cut', 'off', 'somehow', 'editing', 'might', 'be', 'fault', 'cases', 'Overall', 'Being', 'Julia', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'likely', 'appeal', 'theater', 'fans', 'as', 'well', 'viewers', 'who', 'enjoy', 'period', 'pieces', 'Highly', 'recommended']",N/A
