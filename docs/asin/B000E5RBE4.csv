What I got was dissapointment.If you just want a copy of the ABC TV broadcast, a few extras that are so poorly done they aren't worth having, and resolution that is so crude that you see pixelation that appears to be composed of Legos, this is the DVD for you.This looks like someone took a VHS copy of the game, captured it at LOW resolution, and burned it to a disk.  Really, really bad, but it's what's available.  I guess they thought the fans would buy ANYTHING and, sadly, they are probably correct.  So if you HAVE to have a copy (UT grads), buy it.  Otherwise, don't support this kind of shoddy, thrown together junk.Oh, Vince Young is a GOD.

USC went undefeated in a characteristically weak Pac 10 during the same season.  The first three quarters of the 2006 Rose Bowl game, UT managed to hold on only by the skin of its teeth.  In the fourth quarter, Vince Young, who must have gotten into UT through a remedial student program judging from his grammar, was simply magic.  The 2005 Longhorn team rose above 36 years of futility to stand at the top of the college football heap for the third time in its long football history, joining the 1963 and 1969 Longhorn teams as national champions.  (UT claims the 1970 championship, which in fact belonged to Nebraska after UT fell to the Joe Theismann led Fighting Irish team in the 1971 Cotton Bowl.)",4,"Great game, greater ending!",1155081600,"08 9, 2006",2006,823,"['Prior', '2006', 'Rose', 'Bowl', 'UT', 'managed', 'go', 'undefeated', 'benefitting', 'fully', 'severely', 'depleted', 'Big', 'XII', '2005', 'USC', 'went', 'undefeated', 'characteristically', 'weak', 'Pac', '10', 'same', 'season', 'first', 'three', 'quarters', '2006', 'Rose', 'Bowl', 'game', 'UT', 'managed', 'hold', 'only', 'skin', 'teeth', 'fourth', 'quarter', 'Vince', 'Young', 'who', 'must', 'have', 'gotten', 'UT', 'remedial', 'student', 'program', 'judging', 'grammar', 'was', 'simply', 'magic', '2005', 'Longhorn', 'team', 'rose', '36', 'years', 'futility', 'stand', 'top', 'college', 'football', 'heap', 'third', 'time', 'long', 'football', 'history', 'joining', '1963', '1969', 'Longhorn', 'teams', 'national', 'champions', 'UT', '1970', 'championship', 'fact', 'belonged', 'Nebraska', 'UT', 'fell', 'Joe', 'Theismann', 'led', 'Fighting', 'Irish', 'team', '1971', 'Cotton', 'Bowl']",The 2006 Rose Bowl National Championship

I have no idea what to tell you if you're here looking for a great ""digital transfer"" or what not.  All that I know, is that this was possibly the greatest National Championship of all-time featuring the arguably best college football player of all time in Vince Young.The DVD features the entire game with the original game commentary but minus all the commercials.  As I said, I don't really care about the quality of the video.  It is good enough to watch and enjoy the game, jus as if you were watching it on TV.  I can't say much more than that about the quality; however, it brings back so many memories about that great game, that great team, and of course Vince Young himself!

969062,A9UH6I9GVQZU2,B000E5RBE4,"Low-Ranking Reviewer ""tell it like it is""","[14, 14]","This is one of the greatest games that i missed, 3 quarters anyway.  I only saw the 4th qtr and wished i had seen the entire game.  Now i can see this entertainingly high-scoring, last-minute affair with many future NFL stars on this dvd.  As a previous reviewer stated though, the video/image quality is somewhat poor(the audio isn't great either).  During some replays or image transitions, you can see some pixellated images.  The closer you are to the screen, the more noticeable the flaws will be of course and overall it's definitely not up to quality dvd standards.  Having said that, it still is watchable and the visuals are usually good enough for the most part as the color is vivid and if you watch it in its natural 4:3 mode, it looks really good and sharp at times. (note: i was watching the dvd on a 52"" rca hdtv-compatible big-screen and a philips 60"" hd-built in tv.  it looks better if you view it in fullscreen mode, but i like to watch it in panoramic/16:9 view on my big-screen, which unfortunately stretches the images a little and hence the extra pixellation).As for the content, it delivers in this area.*  A handful of brief featurettes concerning the University of Texas football team, with an emphasis on Vince Young.*  The game in its entirety, including a pre-game bit with Will Ferrel/USC vs Matt McCounaghy(sp)/Texas.*  AND GET THIS...two condensed, bonus highlights of the great game between Texas and Ohio State, and the blowout between Texas and OU!  I was not expecting this and was pleasantly surprised they were on there(esp the classic with THE Ohio State).  (note: these highlights have terrible bootleg-looking image quality, but still watchable)This is how i would rate this release:5 stars, if you loved the game or love college football, you've got to have it in your collection.5 stars, if you're a Texas fan.  A national championship you won, plus bonus features including 2 other game highlights.3 stars, if you loved the game or the Texas Longhorns and demand only the best picture quality available because of it.  This dvd will let you down in that case.Personally, i thought the game was great enough to offset the the not-so-great image quality(which is still very watchable imo and comparable to other releases of this type).  Overall, highly recommended; but i do wish they would do a better job putting these dvd's together concerning quality control.",5,"Great Game,  Poorly Presented....",1143676800,"03 30, 2006",2006,2405,"['one', 'greatest', 'games', 'i', 'missed', '3', 'quarters', 'anyway', 'only', 'saw', '4th', 'qtr', 'wished', 'i', 'had', 'seen', 'entire', 'game', 'Now', 'can', 'see', 'entertainingly', 'high-scoring', 'last-minute', 'affair', 'many', 'future', 'NFL', 'stars', 'dvd', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'stated', 'video/image', 'quality', 'somewhat', 'poor', 'audio', ""n't"", 'great', 'replays', 'image', 'transitions', 'can', 'see', 'pixellated', 'images', 'closer', 'are', 'screen', 'more', 'noticeable', 'flaws', 'will', 'be', 'course', 'overall', 'definitely', 'not', 'quality', 'dvd', 'standards', 'Having', 'said', 'still', 'watchable', 'visuals', 'are', 'usually', 'good', 'enough', 'most', 'part', 'color', 'vivid', 'watch', 'natural', '4:3', 'mode', 'really', 'good', 'sharp', 'times', 'note', 'i', 'was', 'watching', 'dvd', '52', 'rca', 'hdtv-compatible', 'big-screen', 'philips', '60', 'hd-built', 'tv', 'better', 'view', 'fullscreen', 'mode', 'i', 'watch', 'panoramic/16:9', 'view', 'big-screen', 'unfortunately', 'images', 'little', 'hence', 'extra', 'pixellation', '.As', 'content', 'area', '*', 'handful', 'brief', 'featurettes', 'concerning', 'University', 'Texas', 'football', 'team', 'emphasis', 'Vince', 'Young', '*', 'game', 'entirety', 'including', 'pre-game', 'bit', 'Will', 'Ferrel/USC', 'vs', 'Matt', 'McCounaghy', 'sp', '/Texas', '*', 'GET', 'THIS', 'two', 'condensed', 'bonus', 'highlights', 'great', 'game', 'Texas', 'Ohio', 'State', 'blowout', 'Texas', 'OU', 'was', 'not', 'expecting', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'were', 'esp', 'classic', 'THE', 'Ohio', 'State', 'note', 'highlights', 'have', 'terrible', 'bootleg-looking', 'image', 'quality', 'still', 'watchable', 'how', 'i', 'would', 'rate', 'release:5', 'loved', 'game', 'love', 'college', 'football', ""'ve"", 'got', 'have', 'collection.5', 'stars', ""'re"", 'Texas', 'fan', 'national', 'championship', 'won', 'bonus', 'features', 'including', '2', 'other', 'game', 'highlights.3', 'stars', 'loved', 'game', 'Texas', 'Longhorns', 'demand', 'only', 'best', 'picture', 'quality', 'available', 'dvd', 'will', 'let', 'down', 'case.Personally', 'i', 'thought', 'game', 'was', 'great', 'enough', 'offset', 'not-so-great', 'image', 'quality', 'still', 'very', 'watchable', 'imo', 'comparable', 'other', 'releases', 'type', 'Overall', 'highly', 'recommended', 'i', 'do', 'wish', 'would', 'do', 'better', 'job', 'putting', 'dvd', 'together', 'concerning', 'quality', 'control']",The 2006 Rose Bowl National Championship

969065,A1QWEUEM90LL9D,B000E5RBE4,"Steven Travers ""AUTHOR/WRITER""","[16, 19]","For those of us who were eyewitnesses of this game, this DVD is a must. I am a USC alum, but this was still probably the greatest game in college football history. It reminded me of what Pete Rose said after losing game six of the 1975 World Series: ""It was a privilege just to play in this game.""Well, being at the Rose Bowl on January 4, 2006 was a privilege, win or lose. I experienced it with my daughter, and it was a treasured memory, never to be forgotten. . . again, even in defeat!That said, the DVD does what watching the game in person does not: reveal USC's many miscalculations, mistakes, mental errors, decisions gone awry, and agonizingly, barely-by-inches calls and plays that cost them. . . any one of which would have assured victory instead of losing that 12-point lead with five minutes left.This DVD does definitely bring back the sights, sounds and smells of that perfect, sunny winter day in the Arroyo Seco, the pre-game festivities, hours of hob-nobbing with old and new friends, and of course magical performances by Matt Leinart and Vince Young. This will go down with the 1979 Indiana State-Michigan State Final Four game between Larry Bird and Magic Johnson as a groundbreaking, seminal sports event. Young, Leinart, Reggie Bush and others will battle each other over the next decade for NFL supremacy, and this game will mark the beginning of the rivalry! Pete Carroll always said a team would have to play great to end his winning streak, and indeed I can only think of one other college performance to rival Young's: Joe Montana, bringing Notre Dame back vs. USC in a 1978 loss at the Coliseum. Young was greatness personified, just like Joe.We will never see another team like USC. They were the greatest team of all time, which is just a way of expresing admiration that the only team that could have beaten them was the 2005 Longhorns with Young at QB.One last note: It was a bitter loss for USC, but assuaged by the wonderful sportsmanship of the Texas faithful. They were loud and boisterous, but polite, respectful, and knew the traditions of not just Texas but USC, too. It was a pleasure to speak with them, and if we had to lose they were better than some of the foul-mouths who often express jealousy at Trojan greatness. Their women were beautiful, their children respectful, even in celebration.
