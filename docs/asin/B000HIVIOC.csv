1014852,A3T2V257AME9SP,B000HIVIOC,A.B.,"[79, 81]","The Facts of Life was the longest running sitcom with an all female cast and of the 1980's. As years goes by the series evolves and just keeps getting better. Season three is by far better than the previous two, with the girls at Eastland (only one more year to go -- then comes 2 years of Edna's Edibles and 3 years of Over Our Head's Era's) they tackle more serious issues as the years go by and as the girls get older. In this season premiere, Tootie feeling left out because she is the youngest and is tired of getting picked on by Blair, Jo, and Natalie turns to alcohol to prove that she is 'just as grown up' as the other girls. As old as this series is, many issues are still current today with teens, and college problems. The stories are very well laid out and realistic (other than season two where it was kind of cheesy in many spots).This season marks one of the most memorable episode of the series with the infamous Paint Fight, which gets the girls into more trouble and put on probation until graduation.Sony has included all full length 24 episodes of season three in this box set. The run time is 602 minutes, which means that The Facts of Life Goes To Paris 2 hr movie (ran as episode numbers 54, 55, 56 and 57 in the series) will not be included in this set, but may be included in the Season Four set.Episodes are as followed30  28 Oct 81  Growing PainsTootie, tired of being treated like a little girl, turns to alcohol.31  4 Nov 81  Fear Strikes BackNatalie withdraws after being attacked while returning from a party.32  11 Nov 81  A Baby in the HouseBlair's married friend brings her baby for a visit and then disappears.33  18 Nov 81  A Friend in DeedBlair learns her mother has been hiding her breast cancer from the family.34  25 Nov 81  Front PageJo's hot news story has serious repercussions for her journalism teacher.35  2 Dec 81  Give and TakeThe girls help Mrs. Garrett when she suffers a financial crisis.36  9 Dec 81  Sweet SorrowJo begins to fall for her class-project husband as her boyfriend Eddie comes to visit.37  16 Dec 81  From Russia With LoveNatalie has romantic plans for the weekend when her adoring grandmother comes to visit.38  23 Dec 81  Dear MeWorried about camping with boys from Bates, Tootie invents an imaginary boyfriend.39  30 Dec 81  Cousin Geri ReturnsThe girls question Geri's date when he asks her out again.40  6 Jan 82  LegacyReceiving a bequest from her grandfather, Blair learns a surprising secret about her family.41  13 Jan 82  Green-Eyed MonsterNatalie becomes jealous when Tootie gets the lead in the school play.42  20 Jan 82  The Americanization of MikoA Japanese student's eagerness to learn American ways upsets her traditional father.43  27 Jan 82  The Marriage BrokersBlair is surprised by what she learns about Mrs. Garrett's new beau.44  3 Feb 82  StarstruckTootie's friends are concerned about her obsession with singer Jermaine Jackson.45  10 Feb 82  The Four MusketeersReleased from custody, the girls must decide whether to go on being roommates.46  17 Feb 82  The AffairNatalie has a painful confrontation with her father after seeing him with another woman.47  24 Feb 82  RunawayTootie decides to go to New York unchaperoned and encounters teenage prostitution.48  3 Mar 82  New York, New YorkVacation trips home seem to make Blair and Jo's feud worse.49  17 Mar 82  Kids Can Be CruelNatalie's revenge on Blair hurts an innocent bystander.50  24 Mar 82  Mind Your Own BusinessSecrecy becomes all-consuming after Natalie learns that Blair peeked into her diary.51  31 Mar 82  The AcademyBlair's blind date for a military school dance is actually a delinquent.52  14 Apr 82  Jo's CousinJo's 14-year-old lovesick tomboy cousin back home needs her help.53  5 May 82  Read No EvilJo takes up the battle when Mrs. Garrett and Natalie get nowhere on the issue of banned books.Remember to order the latest release to get more seasons/era's on dvd!!!!!

1014856,A3PMEJAYKF3VUC,B000HIVIOC,"Antoine D. Reid ""80sforever""","[4, 5]","""The Facts of Life"" Season 3 is another great season that I think any 80s fan or simply any person looking for great writing with a mix of comedy and drama and actual big issues of the day should own. You can read the other reviews to see the variety in the episodes and writing. This season you see the girls travel outside the school a bit more and their friendship change as their probation period (an ongoing Season 2 plot) comes to an end.What I liked about this season was just how the show continued to take on a variety of topics young people faced. The surprising thing is that this show stands the test of time; never did I laugh and say ""that'd never happen today"". The jokes and acting were really well done, and when the show had to hit upon a serious note, it didn't seem awkward at all.My only complaint was that there are NO extra features! That keeps this from being a five-star review. The first released was packed with special features, interviews ... yet none of that is here. As another reviewer mentioned, even the tv movie about the big trip overseas wasn't included. There was definitely room for more in terms of special features and hopefully the next will get more. Other than this flaw, this is still a good release and a show you should own and add to your collection.",4,Another Great Season With the Girls,1162944000,"11 8, 2006",2006,1298,"['Facts', 'Life', 'Season', '3', 'great', 'season', 'think', '80s', 'fan', 'simply', 'person', 'looking', 'great', 'writing', 'mix', 'comedy', 'drama', 'actual', 'big', 'issues', 'day', 'should', 'own', 'can', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'see', 'variety', 'episodes', 'writing', 'season', 'see', 'girls', 'travel', 'school', 'bit', 'more', 'friendship', 'change', 'probation', 'period', 'ongoing', 'Season', '2', 'plot', 'end.What', 'liked', 'season', 'was', 'just', 'how', 'show', 'continued', 'take', 'variety', 'topics', 'young', 'people', 'faced', 'surprising', 'thing', 'show', 'test', 'time', 'never', 'did', 'laugh', 'say', ""'d"", 'never', 'happen', 'today', 'jokes', 'acting', 'were', 'really', 'well', 'done', 'when', 'show', 'had', 'hit', 'serious', 'note', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'awkward', 'all.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'was', 'are', 'NO', 'extra', 'features', 'being', 'five-star', 'review', 'first', 'released', 'was', 'packed', 'special', 'features', 'interviews', 'yet', 'none', 'here', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'even', 'tv', 'movie', 'big', 'trip', 'overseas', 'was', ""n't"", 'included', 'was', 'definitely', 'room', 'more', 'terms', 'special', 'features', 'hopefully', 'next', 'will', 'get', 'more', 'Other', 'flaw', 'still', 'good', 'release', 'show', 'should', 'own', 'add', 'collection']",The Facts of Life - The Complete Third Season

It's a very heavy and emotionally draining season that I personally had to watch in bits and pieces on the DVD box set.  Despite the ultra mature topics of this season, it does include some of the shows most memorable episodes.Disc 3 features the episode ""The Runaway.""  Tootie was upset that her parents wouldn't let her accompany the other girls on a trip to New York so she heads to the city by herself where she befriends a young prostitute and her pimp who try to recruit Tootie.  In another episode, Tootie faces expulsion when she feels compelled to cover for Blair and the other girls who brought alcohol into the dorms.The season opens with the episode ""Growing Pains,"" this is the episode in which Tootie gets drunk and faces punishment.  The very next episode of the season, Natalie is attacked on campus after walking home alone at night. In those same opening season episodes, Blair has to deal with her mother's cancer scare and the girls also have a situation in which a former student named Allison drops by Eastland and leaves her baby with the girls and they fear she isn't coming back.There are some fun episodes in season 3.  Tootie gets to meet her celebrity crush Jermaine Jackson and in another episode Tootie writers love letters to herself to make the other girls feel think she has a secret admirer.The season 3 DVD box set includes 24 episodes from the shows third season.

But, good sales influence sony to release more seasons fast, which is what their doing, sony reported they wouldn't release season 3 until the end of the year or early 2007, but good sales mean release fast which is what their doing, so pre-order and buy, so we can see season 4 soon as well!",5,Release early what we fans like to see,1155254400,"08 11, 2006",2006,535,"['Everybody', 'same', 'thing', 'Facts', 'Life', 'complete', 'first', 'second', 'seasons', 'what', 'took', 'so', 'long', 'answer', 'SONY', 'sony', 'one', 'slowest', 'companies', 'when', 'releasing', 'TV', 'show', 'dvd', 'first', 'time', 'good', 'sales', 'influence', 'sony', 'release', 'more', 'seasons', 'fast', 'what', 'doing', 'sony', 'reported', 'would', ""n't"", 'release', 'season', '3', 'end', 'year', 'early', '2007', 'good', 'sales', 'mean', 'release', 'fast', 'what', 'doing', 'pre-order', 'buy', 'can', 'see', 'season', '4', 'soon', 'as', 'well']",The Facts of Life - The Complete Third Season
1014868,A1N7YA81ZI4KAF,B000HIVIOC,"E. Valero ""Eterno""","[0, 1]","I grew up watching this show. Re-watching these episodes bring back a lot of memories for me. We all had our favorites. My older sister loved Jo, my younger sister loved Natalie, I - being the only male in the household, favored Blair. Although I didn't follow the show from the beginning (I was far too young during the shows first couple of seasons), I did catch most of these episodes on re-runs in the late 80's. Today, watching these episodes as an adult brings a whole new perspective. Many deals with very serious topics. Season 3 deals with issues of drugs, alcohol, jealousy, cancer, teenage prostitution etc and are discussed in a light-hearted manner while throwing in some laughs as well. The first season is an almost different show with a cast made up of mostly young girls, including Molly Ringwald. The show was re-tweaked for Season 2 with a lot of the characters getting the axe. From Season 2 onward, the cast consisted mainly of the motherly Mrs. Edna Garrett (Charlotte Rae), the conceited, pretty blonde, Blair Warner (Lisa Welchel), the comedic aspiring writer, Natalie Green (Mindy Cohn), her best friend, Dorothy ""Tootie"" Ramsey (Kim Fields) and the no-nonsense, in-your-face Joanne ""Jo"" Polniaczek (Nancy McKean). Season 3 would follow the formula of season 2. Many of the episodes are a bit over-dramatic providing more drama than laughs but when the show is called ""The Facts of Life"", this should be expected. Despite this, many episodes featured here are charming and incredibly funny.Stand-out episodes of Season 3:Growing Pains - Blair returns from vacation with 2 bottles of French wine and decides to drink it up with her friends, minus the under-aged Tootie. Feeling left out, Tootie decides to drink after stumbling on to one of Blair's wine bottles and gets drunk jeopardizing her future in Eastland.Give and Take - When the girls find out Mrs. Garrett is in a financial crisis, they realize they have been selfish and decide to help her out.A Baby in the House - Blair's newly married friend comes to visit the girls at Eastland with her baby. It all turns chaotic when she leaves without her baby leaving the girls and Mrs. Garrett to play babysitter. This episode is more melodramatic but provides some really funny moment.A Friend in Deed - Blair's mother reveals the truth about her plastic surgery. Again, this episode has a lot of melodrama, maybe a bit too much but it is very well acted by the cast with some genuinely comedic moments.Green-Eyed Monster - When Tootie gets the female lead in ""South Pacific"", a very jealous Natalie, who also auditioned for the role, tries to make life and rehearsals difficult for her. ""Woops, they dropped."" LOLThe Four Musketeers - The girls probation is finally up and they are able to move to the dorms but soon realize living together wasn't all that bad. Blair and Jo's bickering in this episode is a highlight as is the paint fight.Runaway - When Tootie's parents deny her permission to go on a day trip to New York with the other girls, she decides to challenge authority and go to the big city by herself unchaperoned. Once there she befriends a young prostitute while her pimp eyes the vulnerable Tootie.New York, New York - Blair and Jo take a trip to New York to meet up with old friends. They start getting on each other's nerves and when their respective friends show up, it gets even worse and funnier.Kids Can Be Cruel - When Blair exposes Natalie's secret crush, Natalie takes her revenge by setting her up with a nerdy boy from Bates Academy.Mind Your Own Business - When Blair reads Natalie's diary, she discovers Natalie wrote some very unflattering comments about her so she retaliates. A furious Natalie then sets up house rules that don't go down too well with the girls.For those wanting a little bit of nostalgia with a little added charm and humor, I wholeheartedly recommend this set and the other seasons that have been released on DVD. So far only the first 5 seasons have been released. My favorites season 6 & 7 are still unreleased. Although some of the humor is forced and many of the episodes are heavy on melodrama, and Mindy Cohn appears to be laughing at her own jokes - LOL, when the show works, it works splendidly and it is wonderfully acted. Also, practically everyone can identify with a lot of these characters and the topics being discussed. Times and fashions have definitely changed since these girls were in Prime-Time but the issues they bring to the forefront and the humor live on.Now release the rest of the seasons on DVD please",5,The Fun Facts Season 3,1400544000,"05 20, 2014",2014,4560,"['grew', 'up', 'watching', 'show', 'Re-watching', 'episodes', 'bring', 'back', 'lot', 'memories', 'had', 'favorites', 'older', 'sister', 'loved', 'Jo', 'younger', 'sister', 'loved', 'Natalie', 'being', 'only', 'male', 'household', 'favored', 'Blair', 'did', ""n't"", 'follow', 'show', 'beginning', 'was', 'far', 'too', 'young', 'shows', 'first', 'couple', 'seasons', 'did', 'catch', 'most', 'episodes', 're-runs', 'late', '80', 'Today', 'watching', 'episodes', 'adult', 'whole', 'new', 'perspective', 'Many', 'deals', 'very', 'serious', 'topics', 'Season', '3', 'deals', 'issues', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'jealousy', 'cancer', 'teenage', 'prostitution', 'etc', 'are', 'discussed', 'light-hearted', 'manner', 'throwing', 'laughs', 'well', 'first', 'season', 'almost', 'different', 'show', 'cast', 'made', 'mostly', 'young', 'girls', 'including', 'Molly', 'Ringwald', 'show', 'was', 're-tweaked', 'Season', '2', 'lot', 'characters', 'getting', 'axe', 'Season', '2', 'onward', 'cast', 'consisted', 'mainly', 'motherly', 'Mrs.', 'Edna', 'Garrett', 'Charlotte', 'Rae', 'conceited', 'pretty', 'blonde', 'Blair', 'Warner', 'Lisa', 'Welchel', 'comedic', 'aspiring', 'writer', 'Natalie', 'Green', 'Mindy', 'Cohn', 'best', 'friend', 'Dorothy', 'Tootie', 'Ramsey', 'Kim', 'Fields', 'no-nonsense', 'in-your-face', 'Joanne', 'Jo', 'Polniaczek', 'Nancy', 'McKean', 'Season', '3', 'would', 'follow', 'formula', 'season', '2', 'Many', 'episodes', 'are', 'bit', 'over-dramatic', 'providing', 'more', 'drama', 'laughs', 'when', 'show', 'called', 'Facts', 'Life', 'should', 'be', 'expected', 'many', 'episodes', 'featured', 'here', 'are', 'charming', 'incredibly', 'funny.Stand-out', 'episodes', 'Season', '3', 'Growing', 'Pains', 'Blair', 'returns', 'vacation', '2', 'bottles', 'French', 'wine', 'decides', 'drink', 'up', 'friends', 'under-aged', 'Tootie', 'Feeling', 'left', 'out', 'Tootie', 'drink', 'stumbling', 'one', 'Blair', 'wine', 'bottles', 'drunk', 'jeopardizing', 'future', 'Eastland.Give', 'Take', 'When', 'girls', 'find', 'out', 'Mrs.', 'Garrett', 'financial', 'crisis', 'realize', 'have', 'been', 'selfish', 'decide', 'help', 'out.A', 'Baby', 'House', 'Blair', 'newly', 'married', 'friend', 'visit', 'girls', 'Eastland', 'baby', 'chaotic', 'when', 'baby', 'leaving', 'girls', 'Mrs.', 'Garrett', 'play', 'babysitter', 'episode', 'more', 'melodramatic', 'really', 'funny', 'moment.A', 'Friend', 'Deed', 'Blair', 'mother', 'truth', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'Again', 'episode', 'lot', 'melodrama', 'maybe', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'very', 'well', 'acted', 'cast', 'genuinely', 'comedic', 'moments.Green-Eyed', 'Monster', 'When', 'Tootie', 'female', 'lead', 'South', 'Pacific', 'very', 'jealous', 'Natalie', 'who', 'also', 'auditioned', 'role', 'make', 'life', 'rehearsals', 'difficult', 'Woops', 'dropped', 'LOLThe', 'Four', 'Musketeers', 'girls', 'probation', 'finally', 'up', 'are', 'able', 'move', 'dorms', 'soon', 'realize', 'living', 'together', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'Blair', 'Jo', 'bickering', 'episode', 'highlight', 'paint', 'fight.Runaway', 'When', 'Tootie', 'parents', 'deny', 'permission', 'go', 'day', 'trip', 'New', 'York', 'other', 'girls', 'challenge', 'authority', 'go', 'big', 'city', 'herself', 'unchaperoned', 'Once', 'young', 'prostitute', 'pimp', 'eyes', 'vulnerable', 'Tootie.New', 'York', 'New', 'York', 'Blair', 'Jo', 'take', 'trip', 'New', 'York', 'meet', 'up', 'old', 'friends', 'start', 'getting', 'other', 'nerves', 'when', 'respective', 'friends', 'show', 'up', 'even', 'worse', 'funnier.Kids', 'Can', 'Be', 'Cruel', 'When', 'Blair', 'Natalie', 'secret', 'crush', 'Natalie', 'revenge', 'setting', 'up', 'nerdy', 'boy', 'Bates', 'Academy.Mind', 'Your', 'Own', 'Business', 'When', 'Blair', 'Natalie', 'diary', 'Natalie', 'wrote', 'very', 'unflattering', 'comments', 'so', 'furious', 'Natalie', 'then', 'up', 'house', 'rules', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'down', 'too', 'well', 'girls.For', 'wanting', 'little', 'bit', 'nostalgia', 'little', 'added', 'charm', 'humor', 'wholeheartedly', 'recommend', 'set', 'other', 'seasons', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'So', 'far', 'only', 'first', '5', 'seasons', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'favorites', 'season', '6', '7', 'are', 'still', 'unreleased', 'humor', 'forced', 'many', 'episodes', 'are', 'heavy', 'melodrama', 'Mindy', 'Cohn', 'be', 'laughing', 'own', 'jokes', 'LOL', 'when', 'show', 'splendidly', 'wonderfully', 'acted', 'Also', 'practically', 'everyone', 'can', 'identify', 'lot', 'characters', 'topics', 'being', 'discussed', 'Times', 'fashions', 'have', 'definitely', 'changed', 'girls', 'were', 'Prime-Time', 'issues', 'bring', 'forefront', 'humor', 'live', 'on.Now', 'release', 'rest', 'seasons', 'DVD', 'please']",The Facts of Life - The Complete Third Season

Needless to say, I watched them all as soon they finally arrived in my mailbox.  No bonus features here, but otherwise everything's closed-captioned.  Kudos to the one responsible for this particular feature I truly, absolutely appreciate.As I said here regarding seasons 1 and 2 (see separate review), I fell in love with it since it premiered despite the changes made for S2.  I'd watch it every week if I get to remember, thru high school.  I'd moved on, sometimes not realizing it was *still* around, but when I did I decided to stick with it again in later years til it went off in 1988.TFOL finished 24th in the ratings a couple times in its 9-year run, in season 3 at 19.1 and 5 at 17.3.  All other seasons, probably somewhere in the top 40 if not better.  If I remember right, this show finished in the top 30 in the 9th and final season at 14.9, a very respectable number at the time if you ask me.  Some shows crash and burn in the final season, but not this one.  0:)I'll get future seasons as soon as they come out.

In my opinion it ranks among the best TV sitcoms of all time.Some viewers may find the scripts and acting to be a bit ""heavy handed"", but just remember not to judge too harshly or you may find that your viewing sophistication has come with a very high price tag - a loss of innocence. Children of the late 70's and early 80's viewed many sitcoms from the 50's and 60's with the same type of scrutiny that is sure to be applied to ""The Facts of Life"" by today's viewing audience. But the fact remains that the same simple magic and wisdom that exists within a program such as ""Leave it to Beaver"" also exists within ""The Facts of Life"", no matter how ""uncool"" or ""unhip"" you may judge it to be. To those critics who label this series as ""corny"" or ""dated"" I would only say that I'd much rather live in a ""corny"" world filled with hope and inspiration than an uninspired, ""reality tv"" infested wasteland.At the core of this series is a strong heartbeat that still resonates a very important message of love, caring, understanding, innocence, truth, honesty and hope. You'll laugh and you'll cry as you follow the youthful cast on a wonderful and sometimes painful journey. I actually feel very lucky to have been able to watch and APPRECIATE this series as a child and I can only hope that current and future generations of children will get that chance as well.As far as the DVD set itself, the packaging is excellent and the picture quality is great! I do however wish that this set had ""extras"" like those included on the ""season 1 & 2"" set. I would love to hear episode commentary by cast members, especially Nancy McKeon who was absent from the extras on the previous set. I guess we can only hope for the future!My only complaint is that I can watch an entire box set a whole lot faster than Sony can release them :) I'm hoping that Sony doesn't let this series ""stall"" and continues to release each season at a fast rate!HOW CAN YOU HELP TO MAKE SURE FUTURE SEASONS ARRIVE QUICKLY?By purchasing the product ""NEW"" from Amazon (or another legitimate retailer) your purchase will ""count"" and Sony will hear the message.

The episode alone with Tootie's (Kim Fields) obsession with Jermaine Jackson is worth it alone. A cynical ending, but a great lesson to us all.  The epsiode with Jo (Nancy McKeon) writing the crooked article on her teacher is a classic, which should remind young viewers that the media, the paper and TV, is not always cracked up to what it is meant to be.  The irony of the episode of Tootie getting drunk is remembrance when Kim Fields played a leading role in a TV film a year before called Children of Divorce.  Fields hit the bottle then to get away from the problems of her mother and father.  What people really have to remember about this show is that it is so must better than the show it spun off from, Diff'rent Strokes.

But not the sadness that gets you down, the sadness in knowing that the moment you're living is temporary.I came up with a little saying that I hope you'll like, it's: ""Don't get so caught up in the past that you can't catch up with the present."" I submitted it to Reader's Digest but they rejected it thinking people would mistake ""catch up"" with ""ketchup."" I was like: Wha? How would anyone make a connection between my adage and condiments? What's the expression? That just didn't retain water.Anyhoo, speaking of retaining water, season three is when the ladies really came into their own. No longer are the performances stiff and wooden. I can actually stomach Natalie's overacting. As for Joe and Tutti, I'm afraid they never really got any better. Charlotte Rae the seasoned pro is what held this show together like a big sack of industrial strength glue, but not the kind of glue that's made from horses -- because Facts of Life had a conscience.
