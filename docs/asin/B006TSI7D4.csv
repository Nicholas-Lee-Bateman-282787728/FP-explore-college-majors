1519516,A3LIW0F51A9WNP,B006TSI7D4,D. DiPaola,"[2, 2]","Mill Creek has done good and brought us Heathcliff Season 1 Volume 1. Contains 32 episodes (8 more than the Shout! Factory release but loses the extras and original bumpers so you'll probably want to hang on to that) and a bonus episode of The Get-Along Gang. The transfers are very well by the way. There is however one flaw; On Disc 3, Young Cat With A Horn suffers a defect in which the episode cuts abruptly to another scene in the episode. But there is good news; you can contact Mill Creek regarding this, and they'll send you a replacement disc featuring the corrected version of Young Cat With A Horn (I did and was very happy they did so) albeit on a DVD-R disc. I'm not sure if they plan to do a re-pressing in the future with the corrected version of the episode, but should you buy this and Young Cat With A Horn suffers the defect, contact Mill Creek and they'll send you a replacement as soon as they can. Other than that, the set and the show gets a high recommendation from me (in addition to the fact it stars the legendary Mel Blanc as Heathcliff!).",4,"Great set, but suffers a defect",1378684800,"09 9, 2013",2013,1067,"['Mill', 'Creek', 'done', 'good', 'brought', 'Heathcliff', 'Season', '1', 'Volume', '1', 'Contains', '32', 'episodes', '8', 'more', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'release', 'extras', 'original', 'bumpers', 'so', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'want', 'hang', 'bonus', 'episode', 'Get-Along', 'Gang', 'transfers', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'way', 'however', 'one', 'flaw', 'Disc', '3', 'Young', 'Cat', 'A', 'Horn', 'defect', 'episode', 'cuts', 'abruptly', 'scene', 'episode', 'good', 'news', 'can', 'contact', 'Mill', 'Creek', 'regarding', ""'ll"", 'send', 'replacement', 'disc', 'featuring', 'corrected', 'version', 'Young', 'Cat', 'A', 'Horn', 'did', 'was', 'very', 'happy', 'did', 'so', 'albeit', 'DVD-R', 'disc', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'plan', 'do', 're-pressing', 'future', 'corrected', 'version', 'episode', 'should', 'buy', 'Young', 'Cat', 'A', 'Horn', 'defect', 'contact', 'Mill', 'Creek', ""'ll"", 'send', 'replacement', 'as', 'soon', 'can', 'Other', 'set', 'show', 'high', 'recommendation', 'addition', 'fact', 'legendary', 'Mel', 'Blanc', 'Heathcliff']","Heathcliff: Season 1, Volume 1"

1519522,AE0ES9IJR84VC,B006TSI7D4,"T. Reid ""Very Critical""","[11, 11]","Mill Creek is becoming one my favorite entertainment companies out there.  Their products are extremely cheap and they like to get out whole series for us fans.  I love the fact that they average ten episodes a disc on most of their efforts.  Heathcliff: Season 1, Volume 1 is no exception.  Which is really ""Heathcliff And The Catillac Cats.""  A cartoon from the 80's for those who don't know.  For $10 bucks you get 32 episodes of the series.  With Shout Factory you only got 24 episodes and I paid $35 bucks for that set a few years back.  So you get 8 episodes that have not been released here.  Ladies and gentlemen these cartoons have not been remastered at all.  You can tell from the jump.  But they look really good.  This is a bargain folks.  Don't pass up a good buy here.  Mill Creek always gets a bad rap for packaging....etc.  So what.  At these prices I buy most of their cartoons.  Just got ""Where on Earth is Carmen Sandiego"" too.  Mill Creek, if you keep cranking them out like this and at this price I'm buying.  At least they are not trying to squeeze every penny they can get out of you.  And that's something I can get behind.",5,Heathcliff and The Catillac Cats.
