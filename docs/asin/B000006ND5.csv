494683,A3QCYYGURVRKV7,B000006ND5,Amazon Customer,"[66, 73]","I loved this movie when I first saw it almost 20 years ago.  For a ten year old, I was drawn into the fantasy of pirates, treasures, first loves and I absolutley fell in love with Christopher Atkins.  How could I not with those blonde locks, tight pants, thigh high boots, sword... Anyway, the soundtrack is awsome and I still know the words to all the songs by heart, and the costuming and locations are beautiful as well.  I still wish I had a dress like the one Kristy McNichol wore.  Sure maybe some of the acting is lacking (but I don't think they were really working towards an Oscar) and the jokes are outdated, but this movie is just pure fun!  I especially like the scene when Frederick is seeking the treasure and the animated fish dance and sing around him.I really hope FOX gets their whits together and put this movie onto DVD.  It may not have been a box office smash when it was in theatres decades ago, but it has earned cult status and is a favorite for many movie lovers.  They should just check out how much the movie goes for here on Amazon and on Ebay and get the hint that there is some money to be made on this movie.

494687,A22028GTBTIMBT,B000006ND5,BD Obsessor,"[11, 17]","Like many in Australia, I grew up watching a crummy VHS tape of The Pirate Movie, and it was a film that in spite of going over my head a lot at first, really captured my imagination. As a satire of adventure films, it really hits the nail on the head, and often.As an adult, however, the problems with the VHS tape version are readily apparent to me now. A pan and scan transfer that only allows us to see part of the picture (thus the picture ofen doesn't make sense, particularly during fight scenes), and a sound mix that is as flat as a tack. Sometimes, the vocals are utterly inaudible during the songs (the Pirate King's big number being a prime example).So imagine my despair when the film was released on DVD in Australia last year, only to contain the same VHS-quality pan and scan video transfer, and the same flat-as-a-tack audio. A real kick in the teeth to the poor souls living in this country who supported the film on initial release, and a wake-up call to anyone who thinks they can just slap anything on DVD-Video and it will instantly look or sound better. People have asked me questions along the lines of ""isn't this better than nothing?"". It is worse than nothing. At least when you have nothing, there is a decent chance the distributor will eventually release a decent version. Not surprisingly, the enthusiastic response Fox were expecting for their pan-and-scan, flat Dolby stereo DVD pretty much evaporated as soon as the reviews were in.So Fox, I have the following to say about this upcoming release. You've already made a hash of it in the country where the film was made. Get it right this time. Give us the proper aspect ratio (judging from some shots, it looks like a 1.85:1 hard-matted film), and if you can't get the original source elements to create a 5.1-channel mix, at least remix the Dolby Stereo so that cannon shots sound a little more aggressive than mechanical coughs, for one thing. Don't assume that you can just slap the material onto a disc and expect it to sell.

Rector,"[3, 3]","The Pirate Movie is  an example of a movie that fared poorly at the box office that eventually reached a much bigger audience through such means as cable television, VHS and DVD. This is particularly true of HBO which repeatedly ran this flick over and over during the 1980's. As a result, later audiences were given a chance to appreciate The Pirate Movie as being the work of genius that it really is.The Pirate Movie concerns the adventures of Mabel Stanley (Kristy McNichol) and her ex-pirate boyfriend Frederic (Christopher Atkins). Years ago, the Stanley family fortune was stolen by the evil Pirates of Penzance and Mabel enlists Frederic to retrieve it for her. Of course, Frederic insists that Mabel accompany him in his adventures against his former fellow pirates.Along the way, Frederic and Mabel encounter a host of eccentric characters. Among these are Major-General (Bill Kerr), Sergeant-Inspector (Garry McDonald), Pencilstub (Marc Colombani), Aphrodite (Linda Nagle) and the fearsome Pirate King (Ted Hamilton). In the course of these adventures, Frederic comes to realize that he must choose between the true state of love that he enjoys with Mabel on the one hand and both duty and honor on the other hand.The Pirate Movie is silly, funny, hopelessly romantic and definitely original. It is a model example of a goof ball flick. It was killed when it was originally released in 1982 due to mundane movie critics who could not comprehend its true originality as a comedy. All the critics could see was a parody of the play ""The Pirates of Penzance."" It was that, but it was also so much more. The fact that there are a number of sugary sweet pop songs in this movie makes it all the more wonderful.

It is kitschy, it is juvenile, it is everything as bad as the critics say it is, but hey, this isn't Bergman or Antonioni, or Fellini. If you want edification, look elsewhere. This movie has no pretensions, it is just good clean fun, and above all it is happy. Even the director himself, in his accompanying commentary, is befuddled by it's eventual success and he attributes it to it's happy storyline which seems so rare in our sad time. With all its adolescent antics and blatant sexual innuendo, it still retains a surprisingly innocent feel to it. It's a pleasure to watch it again after more than 20 years.Thank goodness this movie was released by Anchor Bay and not some cheap fly-by-night company. The film is transfered in it's original widescreen aspect ratio of 1.85:1 (enhanced for widescreen TV). I must admit that my heart sank when the opening credits rolled and the picture came out extremely dark, grainy and grimy. But that was apparently deliberate and the picture becomes immaculately clean as the camera draws away from the TV screen showing the stock footage of the opening pirate attack. I doubt if anyone has seen this movie in this pristine a condition since it was first released. The colors are rich, lush and brilliant with well rendered blacks and pure whites. In some scenes the brilliant reds and greens are so vibrant they look like they originated from old 3-strip technicolor reels. Picture detail is well nigh perfect, so much so that the tackiness of the cheap primitive matte shots stand out all the more.The original dual channel stereo has also been remastered to 5.1 surround but I personally prefer the old stereo image. The new 5.1 sounds slightly artificial.Kristy McNichol is adorable. It's sad to learn that this was her last major film. She burnt out far too soon.Aside from the director's commentary and an old TV trailer, there are no other extras.

494703,A15Q9YEG1XPEJN,B000006ND5,Get What We Give,"[8, 11]","If you're looking for a serious Pirates of Penzance film when you view The Pirate Movie, then you're going to be sorely disappointed. If you are looking for some silly fun in a brilliant send up of the very serious Pirates of Penzance then this is it!As well as a poke in the eye to those in Hollywood who would have us believe that sex needs to be brought out front and center, this film is rife with sexual innuendo! You get a light-hearted pleasurable feeling watching this movie. The actors all appear to be having such fun and it becomes terribly contagious.Supposedly the studio that released the film was more than a bit surprised that the film did as well as it did. The critics hated it but the public went - if not in droves.The stars - by all rights - were never truly film stars: Kristy McNichol was a very hot property on television, but not on film. Christopher Atkins was the current boy pin up of the week who was wildly popular for his pretty-boy looks and his seeming indifference to wearing clothing on film (The Blue Lagoon, A Night in Heaven), but he has never been known for his ability as an actor. His very casting ( and maybe unbeknownst to him) seems to be a wink at his barely clothed reputation, but also to cash in on his pin up status.Musicals are not terribly popular with boys, but girls love 'em. Casting Atkins guaranteed a steady stream of nubile young girls attending the film, while McNichols' rather unthreatening appeal kept the female filmgoers from feeling jealous. Atkins strikes quite the romantic leading man's presence in and partially out of the fantastic costumes even if he can't act; and McNichol looks more soft and feminine than she's ever been seen before. I don't know if the two got along, but if they didn't, you couldn't swear it by me, because these two seem to be having the time of their life.There are several songs in the film that are takenly directly  (or rathter spoofed) from the Pirates of Penzance. ""I am the very model of a modern major general"" is absolutely wonderful. ""Taren Tara"" is beautifully performed. ""Pirate King"" is fun and silly. ""Pumping and Blowing"" is a duet with McNichol and Atkins that when heard and viewed cements the reality that this is innuendo. McNichol is actually quite good as a singer. Atkins' singing ability is painful at best - but certainly not cringe-worthy (Heck, even Gene Kelly kept being given roles where he sang and danced - and he couldn't sing - he was a trained dancer!).Today, more than ever, with so many PG rated films being far more ""adult"" than need be, this playful, romatic, cheerful, and frankly wholesome for the whole family romp is a breath of fresh air on the DVD circuit.You'll be tapping your toes to the songs, laughing at the dialogue (as was intended), and viewing this more than once.Yes, this is a heaping helping of cheese! But for pete's sake if you can't get a kick out of some cheesy filmmaking on the light side, then you're taking yourself far too seriously.",3,"Light-hearted, humorous Pirates of Penzance send up rife with sexual innuendo!",1130284800,"10 26, 2005",2005,2993,"[""'re"", 'looking', 'serious', 'Pirates', 'Penzance', 'film', 'when', 'view', 'Pirate', 'Movie', 'then', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'are', 'looking', 'silly', 'fun', 'brilliant', 'send', 'very', 'serious', 'Pirates', 'Penzance', 'then', 'As', 'well', 'poke', 'eye', 'Hollywood', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'sex', 'needs', 'be', 'brought', 'out', 'front', 'center', 'film', 'rife', 'sexual', 'innuendo', 'get', 'light-hearted', 'pleasurable', 'feeling', 'watching', 'movie', 'actors', 'appear', 'be', 'having', 'such', 'fun', 'terribly', 'contagious.Supposedly', 'studio', 'released', 'film', 'was', 'more', 'bit', 'surprised', 'film', 'did', 'as', 'well', 'did', 'critics', 'hated', 'public', 'went', 'not', 'droves.The', 'stars', 'rights', 'were', 'never', 'truly', 'film', 'stars', 'Kristy', 'McNichol', 'was', 'very', 'hot', 'property', 'television', 'not', 'film', 'Christopher', 'Atkins', 'was', 'current', 'boy', 'pin', 'up', 'week', 'who', 'was', 'wildly', 'popular', 'pretty-boy', 'looks', 'seeming', 'indifference', 'wearing', 'clothing', 'film', 'Blue', 'Lagoon', 'A', 'Night', 'Heaven', 'never', 'been', 'known', 'ability', 'actor', 'very', 'casting', 'maybe', 'unbeknownst', 'be', 'wink', 'barely', 'clothed', 'reputation', 'also', 'cash', 'pin', 'up', 'status.Musicals', 'are', 'not', 'terribly', 'popular', 'boys', 'girls', 'love', 'Casting', 'Atkins', 'guaranteed', 'steady', 'stream', 'nubile', 'young', 'girls', 'attending', 'film', 'McNichols', 'rather', 'unthreatening', 'appeal', 'kept', 'female', 'filmgoers', 'feeling', 'jealous', 'Atkins', 'quite', 'romantic', 'leading', 'man', 'presence', 'partially', 'fantastic', 'costumes', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'McNichol', 'more', 'soft', 'feminine', 'ever', 'been', 'seen', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'two', 'got', 'along', 'did', ""n't"", 'could', ""n't"", 'swear', 'two', 'seem', 'be', 'having', 'time', 'are', 'several', 'songs', 'film', 'are', 'takenly', 'directly', 'rathter', 'spoofed', 'Pirates', 'Penzance', 'am', 'very', 'model', 'modern', 'major', 'general', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'Taren', 'Tara', 'beautifully', 'performed', 'Pirate', 'King', 'fun', 'silly', 'Pumping', 'Blowing', 'duet', 'McNichol', 'Atkins', 'when', 'heard', 'viewed', 'cements', 'reality', 'innuendo', 'McNichol', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'singer', 'Atkins', 'singing', 'ability', 'painful', 'best', 'certainly', 'not', 'cringe-worthy', 'Heck', 'even', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'kept', 'being', 'given', 'roles', 'where', 'sang', 'danced', 'could', ""n't"", 'sing', 'was', 'trained', 'dancer', '.Today', 'more', 'ever', 'so', 'many', 'PG', 'rated', 'films', 'being', 'far', 'more', 'adult', 'need', 'be', 'playful', 'romatic', 'cheerful', 'frankly', 'wholesome', 'whole', 'family', 'romp', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'DVD', 'circuit.You', ""'ll"", 'be', 'tapping', 'toes', 'songs', 'laughing', 'dialogue', 'was', 'intended', 'viewing', 'more', 'once.Yes', 'heaping', 'helping', 'cheese', 'pete', 'sake', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'kick', 'cheesy', 'filmmaking', 'light', 'side', 'then', ""'re"", 'taking', 'far', 'too', 'seriously']",The Pirate Movie VHS

Judging by the comments here at Amazon and at other sites I see that I'm not the only one that holds ""The Pirate Movie"" in high regard! A critical and box office disaster upon it's summer of 1982 theatrical release the film found it's audience on video and cable TV. I remember at the time of it's brief run in theaters I read many reviews blasting the filmmakers about being disrespectful to the creators of the original material. Leonard Maltin calls it ""Appalling"" and goes on to say ""...not only trashes the original but fails on it's own paltry terms"" Ouch, Len! Based upon Gilbert & Sullivan's play ""Pirates Of Penzance"" (which wasn't Shakespeare)  itself a fun, silly musical romp! In my opinion, the filmmakers were true to the original source while making it accessible to a modern audience. ""The Pirate Movie"" holds up quite well even with all of it's 1980's sensibilities.About the DVD: Anchor Bay has done it again! A beautiful DVD Widescreen presentation! The movie looks and sounds better than ever and the packaging includes the original movie poster art. The insert includes a 5x7 reproduction of the movie poster. (BTW- all Anchor Bay titles include a 5x7 movie poster reproduction insert.) The original theatrical trailer is also included. The other special feature is an audio commentary by the director of the film Ken Annakin and the Anchor Bay DVD producer is moderating the discussion. The commentary is rather disapointing to me because it's more of a chat about the career of Mr. Annakin than a scene specific commentary about the movie they're viewing. The commentary contains many interesting tid-bits of information and trivia just not all about ""The Pirate Movie"" There is a slight spoiler in the commentary track (during the end credits) about Clint Eastwood's ""Million Dollar Baby"" so, be warned. Plus Mr. Annakin has an interesting theory about what really happend to Amelia Earhart. As I said, the commentary discussion is all over the place! The director has fond memories of the film as do the rest of us who have embraced this delightful musical romp! Perhaps inviting Kristy McNichol and Christopher Atkins to the recording session would have made for a more interesting and balanced commentary. It's not that I'm complaining! I'm happy to have the film on DVD, even if there were no commentary at all!

As a child, it kept me enthralled, and as an adult, it still has all the fun of a true 80's camp masterpiece. There were many of them in those days, and I'm glad that companies like Anchor Bay are still willing to invest in rereleasing cult films.The Pirate Movie is loosely based on The Pirates Of Penzance, but don't think you'll find much similarity aside from general plot here. Taking place in some odd dream sequence, Kristy McNichol's character wishes to marry before her older sisters despite family custom. When she meets an x-pirate and is determined to marry him, all sorts of odd adventures and cheesy swashbuckling mayhem ensue in between bouts of raunchy humor and hilarious pop songs.

The music is hip and upbeat - refelctive of 1982 and the costumes were cleverly intertwined. It really looks like they all had a lot of fun!The audio commentary is great and listening to the director, Ken Anakin (Long Day At The Beach) reminice about the shoot was great.

I even have the original RECORD soundtrack....I wish there was a Making Of documentary on it or I wish Chis and Kristy could have done the commentary too!

I can only imagine the martini-soaked Hollywood power lunches that bred this thing.  ""Hey, The Pirates of Penzance is doing major business on Broadway - let's do a spoof with most of the songs thrown out, and lots of scantily-clad teenage antics thrown in!  Maybe we can get a Baskin-Robbins ice cream tie-in!""  Whatever the rationale, ""The Pirate Movie"" ended up being one of the most deliriously enjoyable guilty pleasures of my childhood. Even at age 10 I knew it was trash, but I loved every moment. Now that it's on DVD, I find myself skipping the interminable love songs but relishing the shameless camp humor and nearly credible renditions of Gilbert & Sullivan's hits.  Kristy McNichol is, indeed, adorable, and I'm sorry she didn't make more films.  ""Tell him, Harry!""  Christopher Atkins was obviously cast for his resemblace to Rex Smith (Frederic on Broadway).  He is endearingly dimwitted in the role, and displays his tanned, toned physique to maximum effect.  Ted Hamilton is a hilariously lecherous Pirate King, and Bill Kerr is a credible Major General.  The jokes swerve from the sophomoric to the inspired, and the throw-away gags usually work the best.  For instance, at one point the Pirate King pretends to twirl his non-existant moustache, then looks confused when the imaginary 'stache makes a squeaky sound effect.

494723,A1MB5HUA3WYEJC,B000006ND5,"Mike ""Movie Buff""","[1, 2]","From my title, the Pirate King didn't know what to say when the pirate ship was about to hit land. Thinking about it as he scratches his head, the ship strikes land that is inhabited by 20 beauties. This was right before the Pirate King asked his fellow pirates about what they needed. All of them replied, ""SEX!!""Anway, when I first saw this movie on cable I loved it. Call it campy, cheesy or a B-movie. It was goofy and was one of those shows that if nothing was on T.V. this would be the one to take out and watch. It's straight out of a 80's movie funbook. For a while I was looking for this on VHS (I'm aging myself) and I found it on Ebay a few years ago. I wasn't even expecting to find this to be released on DVD. Needless to say, I wash shocked. It's a typical 80's movie complete with a good soundtrack and good acting. It was your typical movie complete with one or two actors and actresses that we know of, and blends a crafty soundtrack. It won't win any grammies as the acting will not earn emmies but it just simply pokes some mild fun at the pirate genre as well as the Pirates of Penzeance.This movie is a spoof of pirate movies. You have Christopher Atkins (The Blue Lagoon), Kristy McNichol (Empty Nest), and the actor/producer Ted Hamilton. Ted Hamilton is the Pirate King as well as the producer of this movie. The movie is about Mabel (McNichols) who is considered an outcast. In the 80's this would either be a nerd or someone who has no friends and is not popular. When Mabel hits her head on the boat, she dreams of this classic tale; girl meets boy and they live happily ever after. In between are pirates led by the Pirate King (Hamilton). Frederick (Adkins) was also a pirate but he felt it was time to retire as well the fact that he would rather die than join the very pirates who could be the ones who made him an orphan.All of this adds to fun, humor, playfulness, good singing parts, and a nice take on the pirate genre. It's funny watching the pirates try to ""park"" their ship. The duel between the Pirate King and Frederick is funny. Ted Hamilton plays a good bumbling Pirate King. You wouldn't expect a Pirate King to have a ""cup"" that makes squeeky noises (like a clown nose) amd his continued reference to his package when he is forced to defend it. LoL. Also watch for the light sabre sword used by Frederick (towards the end). The DVD is pretty bare bones as it gets; some commentaries but that's it. It would of been nice to see music videos added from the soundtrack. The closing song ""Give me a happy ending,"" is cute with all of the actors at the end singing and dancing.This is a good addition to anyones DVD library. This movie is for any fan of the 80's movies, spoofs, or just looking for a movie that can substitute for nothing on TV. While it won't (and it hasn't) win any awards or get (and it hasn't) high praise from critics, it's a cult classic.",5,"The Pirate King says,"" Hmmm pretty good parking job.""",1121990400,"07 22, 2005",2005,2900,"['title', 'Pirate', 'King', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'say', 'when', 'pirate', 'ship', 'was', 'hit', 'land', 'Thinking', 'head', 'ship', 'strikes', 'land', 'inhabited', '20', 'beauties', 'was', 'right', 'Pirate', 'King', 'asked', 'fellow', 'pirates', 'what', 'needed', 'replied', 'SEX', 'Anway', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'cable', 'loved', 'Call', 'campy', 'cheesy', 'B-movie', 'was', 'goofy', 'was', 'one', 'shows', 'nothing', 'was', 'T.V', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'take', 'out', 'watch', 'straight', '80', 'movie', 'funbook', 'while', 'was', 'looking', 'VHS', ""'m"", 'aging', 'found', 'Ebay', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'expecting', 'find', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'Needless', 'say', 'wash', 'shocked', 'typical', '80', 'movie', 'complete', 'good', 'soundtrack', 'good', 'acting', 'was', 'typical', 'movie', 'complete', 'one', 'two', 'actors', 'actresses', 'know', 'crafty', 'soundtrack', 'wo', ""n't"", 'win', 'grammies', 'acting', 'will', 'not', 'earn', 'emmies', 'just', 'simply', 'pokes', 'mild', 'fun', 'pirate', 'genre', 'as', 'well', 'Pirates', 'Penzeance.This', 'movie', 'spoof', 'pirate', 'movies', 'have', 'Christopher', 'Atkins', 'Blue', 'Lagoon', 'Kristy', 'McNichol', 'Empty', 'Nest', 'actor/producer', 'Ted', 'Hamilton', 'Ted', 'Hamilton', 'Pirate', 'King', 'as', 'well', 'producer', 'movie', 'movie', 'Mabel', 'McNichols', 'who', 'considered', 'outcast', '80', 'would', 'either', 'be', 'nerd', 'someone', 'who', 'friends', 'not', 'popular', 'When', 'Mabel', 'head', 'boat', 'classic', 'tale', 'girl', 'meets', 'boy', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'are', 'pirates', 'led', 'Pirate', 'King', 'Hamilton', 'Frederick', 'Adkins', 'was', 'also', 'pirate', 'felt', 'was', 'time', 'retire', 'as', 'well', 'fact', 'would', 'rather', 'die', 'join', 'very', 'pirates', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'ones', 'who', 'made', 'orphan.All', 'fun', 'humor', 'playfulness', 'good', 'singing', 'parts', 'nice', 'take', 'pirate', 'genre', 'funny', 'watching', 'pirates', 'try', 'park', 'ship', 'duel', 'Pirate', 'King', 'Frederick', 'funny', 'Ted', 'Hamilton', 'good', 'bumbling', 'Pirate', 'King', 'would', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Pirate', 'King', 'have', 'cup', 'squeeky', 'noises', 'clown', 'nose', 'continued', 'reference', 'package', 'when', 'forced', 'defend', 'LoL', 'Also', 'watch', 'light', 'sabre', 'sword', 'used', 'Frederick', 'end', 'DVD', 'pretty', 'bare', 'bones', 'commentaries', 'would', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'music', 'videos', 'added', 'soundtrack', 'closing', 'song', 'Give', 'happy', 'ending', 'cute', 'actors', 'end', 'singing', 'dancing.This', 'good', 'addition', 'anyones', 'DVD', 'library', 'movie', 'fan', '80', 'movies', 'spoofs', 'just', 'looking', 'movie', 'can', 'substitute', 'nothing', 'TV', 'wo', ""n't"", ""n't"", 'win', 'awards', 'get', ""n't"", 'high', 'praise', 'critics', 'cult', 'classic']",The Pirate Movie VHS

Walker ""catu11us""","[8, 21]","Well, I hate to admit to being wrong, but there actually is a worse Sullivan & Gilbert adaptation than ""Gentlemen of Titipu"".  This one seems to pin its hopes on the presence of some delectable eye candy - namely, Chris Atkins, fresh from taking his clothes off in ""Blue Lagoon"".  This is a performance that ""runs the emotional gamut from A to B"" - as the brilliant Dorothy Parker once snipped about the equally brilliant Katharine Hepburn.Don't worry, friends; it goes downhill from there.The film in question goes by the title ""The Pirate Movie"".  The reason for the title is, apparently, that the people responsible have pirated some pieces of Sullivan's ""Pirates of Penzance"" - just enough to make you wish they had pirated the whole operetta and jettisoned the drek they added to the maimed remains they used.Appearing in this wanton travesty are a bunch of little- and un-knowns who couldn't have salvaged the production even if it was good.  Which of course it isn't.  So the whole baggage sinks under its own dead, dead, dead, boring weight.  Well, it wasn't their fault, really; it was a job for a lot of people who, judging by their credits on the IMDB, didn't get many.  The names are withheld to protect the presumed innocent.The story of ""The Pirate Movie"" follows the general and well-known outline of ""Pirates of Penzance"" (which is easy enough to look up if you don't know it) - although with a number of rather stupid changes that sap it of its original vitality.  To substitute for this vapidity, a composer was hired to write some ""up"" music.  His talent, if any, is scarcely on display.  What we get meager quotations from some of Sullivan's ""Penzance"" tunes - although not always readily recognizable and usually not in the spirit of the original.  Then there is a lot of stuff in a two-bit modern idiom that is also wholly out of touch with Sullivan's originality and wittiness.This film is so awful on so many levels it's hard to find anything positive to say about it.  The color is vibrant; that is to say, wasted on what it shows.  The sound is at least too good for the material.Ah, well.  At least Atkins runs about in descamiado mode for most of the film, which I suppose is some slight compensation.  And not enough.

It has some of what there is about Australian wildness and sunshine that is missing too often from puritanical prudish USA.  I own opera and Gilbert and Sullivan (I love the UK television series complete collection - Clive Revill in the Mikado and in the Sorcerer is just perfect! and fun like this movie is (try the movie ""Avanti! from the 60's).  Given that I studied too hard and worked on ships too much in the 80s to see much of this stuff, I am catching up.  I remember but do not own any music from this era.  Just bought ""Grease"" which is fun in a similar silly way.  I have an unlimited Masters (ship Captains license now expired) and own most nautical movies, including pirate movies.  Why pirate movies? I had enough trouble with drunken sailors on ships to last a lifetime.  It is the fun! The freedom.  It is not real (who wants to be around murderers and rapists), but who does not want to revel in the sun and sea and be a bit tipsy and love and be loved.  Well, movies are not for moral instruction they are for enjoyment  While certainly silly and certainly tongue in cheek, and cheeky, this IS fun.  The locations are wonderful in Australia on in Victoria in mid-summer with blue skies and heat, with beaches, cliffs, gardens and pretty gals and handsome (for you ladies or men inclined so).  Common on!  Us Yanks ought to loosen up a bit (I would rather spend time in this little uneven crazy world of sun and fun than in 99 percent of the television and movies that are on today!  I own all 3 ""Pirates of the Caribbean movies"" , but ""The Pirate Movie"" out shines all three hands down (at least the ocean and the coasts are real and the music is not a loop).",5,Fun stuff with great locations and sunshine and music,1198368000,"12 23, 2007",2007,1745,"['Do', 'not', 'apologize', 'liking', 'romp', 'Pure', 'simple', 'what', 'Australian', 'wildness', 'sunshine', 'missing', 'too', 'often', 'puritanical', 'prudish', 'USA', 'own', 'opera', 'Gilbert', 'Sullivan', 'love', 'UK', 'television', 'series', 'complete', 'collection', 'Clive', 'Revill', 'Mikado', 'Sorcerer', 'just', 'perfect', 'fun', 'movie', 'try', 'movie', 'Avanti', '60', 'Given', 'studied', 'too', 'hard', 'worked', 'ships', 'too', 'much', '80s', 'see', 'much', 'stuff', 'am', 'catching', 'up', 'remember', 'do', 'not', 'own', 'music', 'era', 'Just', 'bought', 'Grease', 'fun', 'similar', 'silly', 'way', 'have', 'unlimited', 'Masters', 'ship', 'Captains', 'license', 'now', 'expired', 'own', 'most', 'nautical', 'movies', 'including', 'pirate', 'movies', 'Why', 'pirate', 'movies', 'had', 'enough', 'trouble', 'drunken', 'sailors', 'ships', 'last', 'lifetime', 'fun', 'freedom', 'not', 'real', 'who', 'be', 'murderers', 'rapists', 'who', 'not', 'want', 'revel', 'sun', 'sea', 'be', 'bit', 'tipsy', 'love', 'be', 'loved', 'Well', 'movies', 'are', 'not', 'moral', 'instruction', 'are', 'enjoyment', 'certainly', 'silly', 'certainly', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'cheeky', 'IS', 'fun', 'locations', 'are', 'wonderful', 'Australia', 'Victoria', 'mid-summer', 'blue', 'skies', 'heat', 'beaches', 'cliffs', 'gardens', 'pretty', 'gals', 'handsome', 'ladies', 'men', 'inclined', 'so', 'Common', 'Us', 'Yanks', 'ought', 'loosen', 'up', 'bit', 'would', 'rather', 'spend', 'time', 'little', 'uneven', 'crazy', 'world', 'sun', 'fun', '99', 'percent', 'television', 'movies', 'are', 'today', 'own', '3', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'movies', 'Pirate', 'Movie', 'shines', 'three', 'hands', 'down', 'least', 'ocean', 'coasts', 'are', 'real', 'music', 'not', 'loop']",The Pirate Movie VHS
