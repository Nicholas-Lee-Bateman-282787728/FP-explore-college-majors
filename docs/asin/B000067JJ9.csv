I intend to keep it, mainly because I think Robson Green just gets better and better.  He does comedy, drama and sweet little movies like this and I know I will watch it again.  The story involves a man who is placed to protect the Prime Minister and what a nice job he does.  Everyone played their parts very well. Scenes were well shot and there were lots of chuckles.  I can imagine reaching the position of Prime Minister and leaving it all for lovely blue-eyed Mr. Green.

I appreciate one reviewer's comparison to ""Sleepless in Seattle"" which I also liked very much but liked this even better!  The supporting characters were well acted, the script interesting and pace exactly right.  I played it for a guy and he liked it too - deeming is was much better than most ""chick flicks"".  I recommend it as wonderful escapist fare for the romance that lies buried in all of us!  Nice to see Phillip Quast in a dramatic role.  I've only seen him in the Les Miz concert and admired his voice and acting ability.  It deserves the ""Masterpiece Theater"" showing and so glad I added it to my DVD collection.  Can watch it more than once!  Green and Goodall are both wonderful to watch - Ivan was also fun and had some of the best comedic lines which he made the most of.
