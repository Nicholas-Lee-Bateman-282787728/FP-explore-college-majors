1245958,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,B0020H45B6,Doug Park,"[2, 2]","The first 30 minutes or so are very engrossing, but the plot of MOSCOW CHILL often comes near derailment in the next two-thirds. All the same, it ties up very nicely in the end. Some violence, of course, but it wastes no time on prolonged shoot-'em-ups and punch-'em-outs. Great soundtrack and use of scenery. Norman Reedus is quite convincing as genius Robin Hood computer hacker Ray Perso--his whole demeanor is kind of Zuckerbergish, which is fitting. Kseniya Buravskaya gives a particularly splendid performance as Maya, with whom Ray finds true love. Much of the supporting cast--particularly the actor who plays Maya's father--are also worthy-of-mention and do a great deal to carry this unusual film.MOSCOW CHILL may not have the kick that thriller fans want. It also lacks the layers of intrigue that many others expect. However, it has a flavor that's just all its own. This film has real heart with steady, believable humor, which make its lesser qualities forgivable. Though it has neither the scope nor the plot development ofKiller Elite, the conflict of how Perso wants out but finds it hard to simply walk out of the game reminded me a bit of that film.",4,Good Film that Overcomes Its Flaws,1387411200,"12 19, 2013",2013,1168,"['first', '30', 'minutes', 'so', 'are', 'very', 'engrossing', 'plot', 'MOSCOW', 'CHILL', 'often', 'near', 'derailment', 'next', 'two-thirds', 'same', 'up', 'very', 'nicely', 'end', 'violence', 'course', 'time', 'prolonged', ""shoot-'em-ups"", ""punch-'em-outs"", 'Great', 'soundtrack', 'use', 'scenery', 'Norman', 'Reedus', 'quite', 'convincing', 'genius', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'computer', 'hacker', 'Ray', 'Perso', 'whole', 'demeanor', 'kind', 'Zuckerbergish', 'fitting', 'Kseniya', 'Buravskaya', 'particularly', 'splendid', 'performance', 'Maya', 'whom', 'Ray', 'true', 'love', 'Much', 'supporting', 'cast', 'particularly', 'actor', 'who', 'Maya', 'father', 'are', 'also', 'worthy-of-mention', 'do', 'great', 'deal', 'carry', 'unusual', 'film.MOSCOW', 'CHILL', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'kick', 'thriller', 'fans', 'want', 'also', 'layers', 'intrigue', 'many', 'others', 'expect', 'However', 'flavor', 'just', 'own', 'film', 'real', 'heart', 'steady', 'believable', 'humor', 'make', 'lesser', 'qualities', 'forgivable', 'scope', 'plot', 'development', 'ofKiller', 'Elite', 'conflict', 'how', 'Perso', 'out', 'hard', 'simply', 'walk', 'game', 'reminded', 'bit', 'film']",N/A

Was really looking forward to scenes of Moscow BUT not enough Moscow and script??? If it had been editted some maybe. Started and stopped several times. Acting 90& ok. Not enough action for men only.

I got this movie because I am a huge Norman Reedus fan. even he couldn't save this movie, what a diluted mess. Except for Norman, I don't think anyone could actually act.
