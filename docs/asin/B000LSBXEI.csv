1040515,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B000LSBXEI,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[0, 1]","Billy Blanks Tae-Bo-Get Celebrity Fit-Cardio is a standard Tae Bo Cardo video--meaning that it ranks right there in the middle of the bell curve.  Its not really bad likeBilly Blanks' Tae-Bo Cardiowhere the music is so slow-paced and the instruction interrupted with Billy's signature remarks, but its not a great workout either likeTae Bo Extreme! Billy Blanks, TaeBo, Push Your Limitswith faster music and less frequent lulls in the action.Billy's technique works around the concept of doing the slow move first and then amping it up in what he calls a ""cardio"" move later.  Whether or not his method qualifies as High Intensity Interval Training or not depends on what the participant is willing to put into it.  Blanks will keep you moving, but its up to the viewer to really be vigilant.  Its so easy to slacken off while Billy gives one of his motivational minutes.  The music selected is an electronic vibe that works well;its ten times better than some of the other music Blanks selects for his other DVDs.  There are, however, the usual complaints--Blanks tends to do only one side and than moves onto another slower move without amping up the last move as expected.  But, don't get bogged down by this. As pointed out before, the fact that you are slowing down--not stopping, but keeping a steady faster heart rate and then pushing it may mean a much better calorie burn than expected.Get Celebrity Fit-Cardio is only 45 minutes long--the warm-up is relatively quick as is the cool-down.  There is no floor work and there are no extreme jumping moves--Blanks utilizes his most familiar sequences to keep the body moving--although there are times when he throws in an ""In-Out"" move that just ruins the pace. Some of his combinations are awkward and do not work in an ""at home/in-front-of-the-TV"" space. Learn to make it work for you.  When Blanks starts instructing one of his longer combos, I just start punching and kicking around the room just to keep my heart going.  This can be annoying. Again, being prepared for these lags in the action will help the exerciser step up the action for his/herself--but the first time view can be a bit of a drag.  This workout increases in value the more times that you do. You are familiar with what is coming and improvise.Bottom line?  If you are looking for a 45 minute workout that uses familiar Tae Bo moves and you don't mind improvising when instructor Billy Blanks attempts to demonstrate an awkward sequence of moves that breaks the overall pace of the session, you may want to include Celebrity Fit Cardio in your DVD collection.  Be prepared for better music, but don't expect the original Tae Bo Live Advanced 60 minute workout.  Wish Blanks would reissue that Live Advanced Set of 12!

Lately I have been using Cardio Inferno and This is Tae Bo. I just got Celebrity Fit Cardio today to spice things up a bit. I just finished the workout and am sitting here lightly glistening in sweat as I type this review. The first 20 minutes of this 40 minute workout is paced too slow. Fortunately the pace picks up during the next 15 minutes and slows back down during the last 5. Right when I was all pumped up and ready to really work it, he goes into a cool down. :-(Billy is not on his game in this one. He messes up about three times. Once he forgets to do a set of an exercise on one side, another time he messes up a sequence and breaks into a back and forth jog to try and cover it up, and lastly in the very end he cuts the final set at double pace short because the music changes and goes right into the cool down. Because he takes too much time explaining the sequences, I had to run in place to keep my heart rate up during those slow periods.With a name like Celebrity Fit I was expecting it to be faster pace and an entire hour long. It is a good workout for those days when you want to take a rest from the intense and are shorter on time. I did work up a sweat and there were some neat sequences...but because of the mistakes, Billy's clown outfit, and the cheesy music (which strangely enough everyone on the dvd seems to enjoy) this workout only gets three stars!",3,"Slow start, but picks up half way through",1292976000,"12 22, 2010",2010,1460,"['have', 'been', 'doing', 'Tae', 'Bo', 'first', 'came', 'out', '90', 'LOVE', 'IT', 'Lately', 'have', 'been', 'using', 'Cardio', 'Inferno', 'Tae', 'Bo', 'just', 'got', 'Celebrity', 'Fit', 'Cardio', 'today', 'spice', 'things', 'up', 'bit', 'just', 'finished', 'workout', 'am', 'sitting', 'here', 'lightly', 'glistening', 'sweat', 'type', 'review', 'first', '20', 'minutes', '40', 'minute', 'workout', 'paced', 'too', 'slow', 'Fortunately', 'pace', 'up', 'next', '15', 'minutes', 'back', 'down', 'last', '5', 'Right', 'when', 'was', 'pumped', 'up', 'ready', 'really', 'work', 'cool', 'down', 'Billy', 'not', 'game', 'one', 'up', 'about', 'three', 'times', 'Once', 'do', 'set', 'exercise', 'one', 'side', 'time', 'up', 'sequence', 'breaks', 'back', 'forth', 'jog', 'try', 'cover', 'up', 'lastly', 'very', 'end', 'final', 'set', 'double', 'pace', 'short', 'music', 'changes', 'right', 'cool', 'down', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'explaining', 'sequences', 'had', 'run', 'place', 'keep', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', 'slow', 'periods.With', 'name', 'Celebrity', 'Fit', 'was', 'expecting', 'be', 'faster', 'pace', 'entire', 'hour', 'long', 'good', 'workout', 'days', 'when', 'want', 'take', 'rest', 'intense', 'are', 'shorter', 'time', 'did', 'work', 'up', 'sweat', 'were', 'neat', 'sequences', 'mistakes', 'Billy', 'clown', 'outfit', 'cheesy', 'music', 'strangely', 'enough', 'everyone', 'dvd', 'enjoy', 'workout', 'only', 'three', 'stars']",N/A

Grant,"[2, 2]","Look you are going to have people who are beginners and ones who are intermediate to advanced, and so the reviews are always going to reflect various opinions.  I'm in the 2nd group and I find this DVD to be fast paced and fun!  Usually in some of the older TAE BO DVDs, Billy Blanks is doing way too much talking in between the moves and I found it to be annoying at times but in this one they were moving all the time.  The background is warm and the music is upbeat.  Sure Billy made some mistakes but I just adjusted by doing extra steps on the opposite side or started moving faster when he was taking too slow showing the steps (a few times) and kept going!  I like the combinations and found them to be a pleasant change from the usual workouts.  This is a not a main workout for me but I rotate it in when in between harder workouts (usually with weights) to get more cardio in.  I don't really find that this is for beginners, even though it does incorporate a lot of the regular TAE BO moves, as there isn't a lot of explanation of the moves (sometimes) and it's a fast workout but if you are motivated you will catch on after a few tries!",5,This is a fun and upbeat TAE BO workout!,1255219200,"10 11, 2009",2009,1149,"['Look', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'beginners', 'ones', 'who', 'are', 'intermediate', 'advanced', 'so', 'reviews', 'are', 'always', 'going', 'reflect', 'various', 'opinions', ""'m"", '2nd', 'group', 'find', 'DVD', 'be', 'fast', 'paced', 'fun', 'Usually', 'older', 'TAE', 'BO', 'DVDs', 'Billy', 'Blanks', 'doing', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'talking', 'moves', 'found', 'be', 'annoying', 'times', 'one', 'were', 'moving', 'time', 'background', 'warm', 'music', 'upbeat', 'Sure', 'Billy', 'made', 'mistakes', 'just', 'adjusted', 'doing', 'extra', 'steps', 'opposite', 'side', 'started', 'moving', 'faster', 'when', 'was', 'taking', 'too', 'slow', 'showing', 'steps', 'few', 'times', 'kept', 'going', 'combinations', 'found', 'be', 'pleasant', 'change', 'usual', 'workouts', 'not', 'main', 'workout', 'rotate', 'when', 'harder', 'workouts', 'usually', 'weights', 'get', 'more', 'cardio', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'find', 'beginners', 'even', 'incorporate', 'lot', 'regular', 'TAE', 'BO', ""n't"", 'lot', 'explanation', 'moves', 'sometimes', 'fast', 'workout', 'are', 'motivated', 'will', 'catch', 'few', 'tries']",N/A
1040521,A2C5VLIJMDPWHI,B000LSBXEI,"Shamontiel L. Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[4, 6]","Pros: I don't know what it is about workout DVDs, but I usually enjoy doing them, especially if it involves hip hop dancing or some form of boxing (kick boxing, arm boxing), so Taebo is a good mix of both. Some of the moves are kinda funky, and by the time I was done, you would've thought somebody threw a bucket of water on my back. I was surprised because I'm not a person who sweats a lot, but I think I worked every single muscle I have while doing this DVD. I got it on clearance for $8, so I definitely feel like I got my money's worth.I like how he got in front of the camera for distance moves. When he put his hands in the air, I knew exactly how wide to kick apart or punch. The counting helped when it was on beat too, and I didn't mind that at all.Cons: I have never done a workout DVD with combinations where the second move started on 4. You usually hear 1-2-3-4-then the next step-1-2-3-4, but on this one, there were too many times when the moves were all off count. Then there were times when you worked out on one side slow and then fast, but on the other side, you worked out fast or not at all. Some of the people in the video class seemed like regulars and said they got the moves immediately, but then I watched a few workout members mess up. What's worse is that Billy Blanks actually messes THEM up on a couple of occasions because he tries to blend in with a move that they've already started. The video editor definitely either didn't know how to edit these parts out or said, ""Screw it. Leave it like it is.""And the idea of being scared of someone never crosses my mind, but these Amazon reviewers who are saying this video was too slow terrify me. This video was incredibly fast. There were some slow parts where he wanted to talk, but for a few parts, it was too fast to even get the move down. (I have pretty good coordination and usually pick up moves fast.) But then sporadically, he'd do a move slowly, and then go faster. That's what I'm used to seeing--when someone does a technique slow enough for all to catch on, and then pick up the pace. But he kept working out in fast forward, and then suddenly deciding to do the next move slow to teach people. It was just awkward, and the moves I couldn't catch on to, I jogged or danced in place. I saw absolutely no reason to do moves with my back to the television and confuse myself further.Final result: I'd do this again! Maybe only once a week because the workout is so sporadic--like he made it up while the camera was rolling--but it was also so fast that I didn't realize 43 minutes had passed. Personally, I think 40+ minutes of a workout is long. I'm used to half-hour workouts at most, but considering this workout was on speed, I was too busy trying to keep up to pay attention to a clock counter.",3,1-2-3-NEXT!,1213401600,"06 14, 2008",2008,2790,"['Pros', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'workout', 'DVDs', 'usually', 'enjoy', 'doing', 'especially', 'hip', 'hop', 'dancing', 'form', 'boxing', 'kick', 'boxing', 'arm', 'boxing', 'so', 'Taebo', 'good', 'mix', 'moves', 'are', 'kinda', 'funky', 'time', 'was', 'done', 'would', ""'ve"", 'thought', 'somebody', 'threw', 'bucket', 'water', 'back', 'was', 'surprised', ""'m"", 'not', 'person', 'who', 'lot', 'think', 'worked', 'single', 'muscle', 'have', 'doing', 'DVD', 'got', 'clearance', '8', 'so', 'definitely', 'feel', 'got', 'money', 'worth.I', 'how', 'got', 'front', 'camera', 'distance', 'moves', 'When', 'put', 'hands', 'air', 'knew', 'exactly', 'how', 'wide', 'kick', 'apart', 'punch', 'counting', 'helped', 'when', 'was', 'beat', 'too', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'all.Cons', 'have', 'never', 'done', 'workout', 'DVD', 'combinations', 'where', 'second', 'move', 'started', '4', 'usually', 'hear', '1-2-3-4-then', 'next', 'step-1-2-3-4', 'one', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'when', 'moves', 'were', 'off', 'count', 'Then', 'were', 'times', 'when', 'worked', 'out', 'one', 'side', 'slow', 'then', 'fast', 'other', 'side', 'worked', 'out', 'fast', 'not', 'people', 'video', 'class', 'seemed', 'regulars', 'said', 'got', 'moves', 'immediately', 'then', 'watched', 'few', 'workout', 'members', 'mess', 'up', 'What', 'worse', 'Billy', 'Blanks', 'actually', 'THEM', 'up', 'couple', 'occasions', 'blend', 'move', ""'ve"", 'already', 'started', 'video', 'editor', 'definitely', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'edit', 'parts', 'out', 'said', 'Screw', 'Leave', 'idea', 'being', 'scared', 'someone', 'never', 'mind', 'Amazon', 'reviewers', 'who', 'are', 'saying', 'video', 'was', 'too', 'slow', 'terrify', 'video', 'was', 'incredibly', 'fast', 'were', 'slow', 'parts', 'where', 'wanted', 'talk', 'few', 'parts', 'was', 'too', 'fast', 'even', 'get', 'move', 'down', 'have', 'pretty', 'good', 'coordination', 'usually', 'pick', 'up', 'moves', 'fast', 'then', 'sporadically', ""'d"", 'do', 'move', 'slowly', 'then', 'go', 'faster', 'what', ""'m"", 'used', 'seeing', 'when', 'someone', 'technique', 'slow', 'enough', 'catch', 'then', 'pick', 'up', 'pace', 'kept', 'working', 'out', 'fast', 'forward', 'then', 'suddenly', 'deciding', 'do', 'next', 'move', 'slow', 'teach', 'people', 'was', 'just', 'awkward', 'moves', 'could', ""n't"", 'catch', 'jogged', 'danced', 'place', 'saw', 'absolutely', 'reason', 'do', 'moves', 'back', 'television', 'confuse', 'further.Final', 'result', ""'d"", 'do', 'again', 'Maybe', 'only', 'once', 'week', 'workout', 'so', 'sporadic', 'made', 'up', 'camera', 'was', 'rolling', 'was', 'also', 'so', 'fast', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', '43', 'minutes', 'had', 'passed', 'Personally', 'think', '40+', 'minutes', 'workout', 'long', ""'m"", 'used', 'half-hour', 'workouts', 'most', 'considering', 'workout', 'was', 'speed', 'was', 'too', 'busy', 'trying', 'keep', 'up', 'pay', 'attention', 'clock', 'counter']",N/A
