Life is seen through the eyes of a young boy who does not judge. Instead he can enter each character's intermost being and know their thoughts and feelings.

560604,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B00004Z1FL,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[7, 10]","As you may know by reading most of my reviews, I love Russell Crowe and feel he is the best actor to grace the big screen, ever.  That aside, this was a decent film.  I feel that this is the type of film you either love or you hate, and I really think you need to relate to the film to appreciate it.  Growing up I had no older brothers to look up to but I always long for someone like East, and for a while I had that someone.  The young boy in this movie wants to be around East (Crowe) at all times, helping him on his ranch just to be around him, and he even goes as far as to become somewhat of a pest, always there even when unwanted.  I know what thats like.  I particularly like the opening sequence when Crowe is skinny dipping and the boy is just watching him, talking about how there are gods amoung men or something like that (can't remember exactly what he says) but what I like is the fact that this shows the pure admiration in this boys eyes...East is perfect, even just to watch.  I remember when I admired my friend I bugged the crap out of him.  We're cool now (I'm older and have my own life, but at the time...I was a bit of a nuesence)  That's besides the point.  I loved this movie becasue it helped me see what I was going through.  It helped me understand what my friends were feeling.  That and Crowe is just amazing here.  He is captivating and makes this film as great as it is.  The quality of the film is poor, but the message it brings is worth it.  If you've felt similierly at any point in your life, try this movie, you may find it's just what you need to see.",4,Coming of age film,1118275200,"06 9, 2005",2005,1594,"['may', 'know', 'reading', 'most', 'reviews', 'love', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'feel', 'best', 'actor', 'grace', 'big', 'screen', 'ever', 'aside', 'was', 'decent', 'film', 'feel', 'type', 'film', 'love', 'hate', 'really', 'think', 'need', 'relate', 'film', 'appreciate', 'Growing', 'up', 'had', 'older', 'brothers', 'look', 'up', 'always', 'long', 'someone', 'East', 'while', 'had', 'someone', 'young', 'boy', 'movie', 'be', 'East', 'Crowe', 'times', 'helping', 'ranch', 'just', 'be', 'even', 'as', 'far', 'become', 'somewhat', 'pest', 'always', 'there', 'even', 'when', 'unwanted', 'know', 'what', 'particularly', 'opening', 'sequence', 'when', 'Crowe', 'skinny', 'dipping', 'boy', 'just', 'watching', 'talking', 'how', 'are', 'gods', 'amoung', 'men', 'something', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'exactly', 'what', 'what', 'like', 'fact', 'pure', 'admiration', 'boys', 'eyes', 'East', 'perfect', 'even', 'just', 'watch', 'remember', 'when', 'admired', 'friend', 'bugged', 'crap', ""'re"", 'cool', 'now', ""'m"", 'older', 'have', 'own', 'life', 'time', 'was', 'bit', 'nuesence', 'point', 'loved', 'movie', 'becasue', 'helped', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'helped', 'understand', 'what', 'friends', 'were', 'feeling', 'Crowe', 'just', 'amazing', 'here', 'captivating', 'film', 'as', 'great', 'quality', 'film', 'poor', 'message', ""'ve"", 'felt', 'similierly', 'point', 'life', 'try', 'movie', 'may', 'find', 'just', 'what', 'need', 'see']",Hammers over the Anvil

560606,A1G56KHOUOFWDW,B00004Z1FL,"Dianne Foster ""Di""","[39, 42]","Russell Crowe has to be one of the best actors around.  He is versatile, believeable, and the &quot;Everyman&quot; most of us can identify with on some level.  Of course the fact that he's got a great body and reminds me of a boy I was crazy about in high school has nothing to do with my judgement of his acting abilities.Seriously, the actors and the director of this film should be commended.  In my book, HAMMERS OVER THE ANVIL ranks right up there with ANGEL AT MY TABLE (Kerry Fox) and MY BRILLIANT CAREER (Judy Davis). All these films are set in Austrailia and New Zealand, directed by women, and about a young person's coming of age.  All three of the young protagonists grow up to become writers and the stories are autobiographical.If you appreciated the cinematograpy in Campion's ANGEL AT MY TABLE and you love the Australian countryside you will marvel at scenes shot in the dewy mists of morning, the blazing noon day sun and by moonlight. The DVD is very clear and the frames are  well articulated. The Australian Film Board sponsored the film so it's a work of art.HAMMERS OVER THE ANVIL is set in 1910--before WWI. As I watched the film I felt I was observing a lost way of life. Even 50 years ago in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the U.S. agricultural communities still existed and blacksmiths were relatively common (hammers and anvils).HAMMERS a slice of life, and more. A dramatic series of events unfolds. I won't reveal the ending, but say it did not end the way I thought it would. This film was directed by a woman and contains a strong female lead. Most women I know will appreciate the story. Charlotte Rampling is wonderful and I could totally identify with her in this role (whereas I could not when she played Ms. Haversham in GREAT EXPECTATIONS).  She is an excellent actress and her relationship with East (Crowe) was entirely believeable.  It may be HAMMERS OVER THE ANVIL is the story of a boy's coming of age, but the women and girls in this film create a real presence.

It is also often narrated by him. The plot covers several aspects of the Alan's life. His relationship with his father; his idle worship of a local horse trainer; his infatuation with a local aristocratic English lady; and his struggles to fit-in (or keep up with) the other children his age.Life is a struggle for him: his mother is dead; he thinks his father is a coward; he can't run with his friends; he can't mount a horse; an elderly friend dies; and possibly worst of all, he learns that the horse trainer he idolizes is having an affair with the English lady with whom the boy himself is in love.The movie is well written, well directed, well acted, and easy to follow. The fast moving plot keeps things interesting. Even when the you see the error of the Alan's view, you can also understand why he sees thing as he does, and can sympathies with him. There are humorous parts in the movie, but it is still a serious drama.The movie begins with the horse trainer East Driscoll skinny dipping followed by nude horseback riding. Alan is watching (and narrating) from not far away. It is around a minute and a half sequence where East is often seen clearly from the rear, but not clearly from the front. A little ways into the film Alan and his best friend Joe watch a man and woman having sex in a barn. The couple are still wearing enough clothing to prevent any nudity from being seen but the actions are clearly seen. Following this the two boys go out to a pasture and lie in the high grass and masturbate. The part of the boys seen above the grass (about the waist up) are fully clothed but what they are doing is quit clear. Later in the movie Alan watches East and Grace having sex. Both are fully nude but while seen fully nude they are some what silhouetted. The sequence is a little over a minute and a half but the full nudity is only seen for the first few seconds. A rear view of Grace is mainly what is seen here. Most of the sequence is close-ups of East and Grace from the shoulders up, and close-ups of Alan's face. Still later in the film Alan convinces a girl about his age to open her blouse in front of him. He sees her under garments, but the audience sees only enough to know that she has undergarments.The only extras on the disc are Filmographies and Production Credits.",4,This is a coming-of-age story of a handicapped teenager.

The events that occur during the ""hammering"" process are shown as the film progresses. I just saw this movie in a gift subscription to Netflix and now plan to buy it. Ann Turner's tasteful handling of East's ride should override the condemnation of nudity that seems to pervade many of the comments I've read here. Like any healthy Russell Crowe fan, I marveled at his physical magnificence(FYI I knew nothing of a nude scene until I viewed the film)--but it was his character East's intensity and naivete, his elemental self that  deeply affected me. Yet, in contrast with the blacksmith's brutal taking of young girls, East was tender in loving Grace. It's a shame some people are so sadly taught, practically from birth, that sex is dirty and nudity is something to be ashamed of.  How did THEY get here anyway--via the stork? The threat of heaven and hellfire and brimstone was hammered into them as children and resulted in their becoming dogmatic adults.Freedom is also shown in the way Allan, though stricken with polio, and his fellow youths interact.  His father's efforts to make a horseman of him and Allan's herculean efforts are excruciatingly painful yet you keep rooting for the kid. The father doesn't force this on him, but the boy wants to be a horseman.  Yet he hops about free in his own way, casually bantering and not looked down upon by the other boys. He is picked up and danced with by some taller girls and he gets to kiss girls, pull stunts, and ride in front of East, his hero.Charlotte Rampling (one of my favorites of all time) plays Grace, an aristocratic lady and a true woman. With an unconventional, angular beauty and understated words, and an underlying sensuality, she (Rampling herself) has the look of eagles. We see in the multifaceted lady her most tender side when she first rides up to the boy, Allan, to whom she introduces herself as ""GraceShe has superb riding ability, horse bargaining savvy, and a deep need, and therefore, a capacity for love. But her generosity of spirit is shown most strongly in her relationship with the smitten young confidante Allan, her innate understanding and tender treatment of him, respectful of his dilemma as a young man coming of age, and his heroic act shows us the stuff of heroes. And ultimately Grace, even more than his role model East, shows Allan the stuff of heroes.This film won Russell Crowe an Australian award and he richly deserves it.
