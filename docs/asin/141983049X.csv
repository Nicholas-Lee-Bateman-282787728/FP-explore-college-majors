At about that time they started producing DVDs of some old shows, so I decided to collect the best of them to watch anytime I please.So far I&#8217;ve bought DVDs of forty shows. I&#8217;ve found some fine shows, such as Matlock and Trapper John, which I missed the first time around. And I have been disappointed by shows such as The Greatest American Hero and The A Team, which I once enjoyed.The best recent show, in my opinion, was The Closer. Kyra Sedgwick as Brenda Lee Johnson was one of only three regular female cast members, but she more than held up her end, often in contention with numerous strong male characters, especially those played by Tony Denison, G.W.Bailey and Jon Tenney.The story lines were the best of any police show I&#8217;ve ever seen. The acting of everyone was first-rate. Even the subplots were sustained above the level of commonplace melodrama.If there was anything wrong with this show at all, it was a half-dozen episodes at the end of season seven, in which Sedgwick&#8217;s endearing character was confronted with a series of emotion-crushing incidents.Here are the ten shows I watch most often in a delightful fare of prime-time DVD viewing: 1. Little House on the Prairie; 2. Touched by an Angel; 3. The Closer; 4. Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman; 5. Bonanza; 6. Hawaii Five-0 (the original show with Jack Lord); 7.

The amusing thing is that as the series goes along, she's obviously trying to figure out how to get along better with those she works with, and she generally succeeds (with one serious exception).The supporting cast is also very good. Corey Reynolds' David Gabriel is the perfect sidekick for her, veteran character actors G.W. Bailey and Tony Dennison are wonderful as Lts. Provenza and Flynn, John Tenney is wonderful as the exasperated/bemused boyfriend/FBI colleague Fritz, and J.K. Simmons is wonderful as her boss Assistant Chief Will Pope.The series's first season is especially good. For one thing, there's a plot thread throughout the first season as the whole team gets used to her, and she them. It's probably better if you watch the episodes in groups of two or three, over a period of only a few days.

The time slot was always when I was taking a break from pounding the keys. I found myself kicking back with a cup of tea and getting acquainted with Deputy Chief Brenda Lee Johnson played superbly by Kyra Sedgwick.Ms. Sedgwick captures the essence of us steel magnolias and imbues the character with real personality. The funny thing about the character of Brenda Johnson is that she observes the letter of the white glove manners we were all taught at our mothers' knees, but she fails miserably in observing the spirit of those well-bred manners. In reality, she's as abrupt and irritable as any urban female out there yet she cloaks it behind the smile and utterances of, ""thank you very much.""RERUNS HOOKED MESince I'd never watched the show before, I found the reruns inspired my curiosity as to how this southern belle ended up in Los Angeles and how the Californians on her team came to accept the seemingly always angry head of Priority Murder. Not to mention how she hooked -- and managed to keep -- such a hottie as Jon Tenney who plays Special Agent Fritz Howard, her love interest.PRAISEThus I broke down and ordered the Season 1 DVD, and it's worth every penny. You've got original stories that are whodunits that keep you guessing. There's great acting by Ms. Sedgwick, Tenney, and a supporting cast made of J. K. Simmons, Corey Reynolds, Raymond Cruz, Robert Gossett, G. W. Bailey, Tony Dennison, Gina Ravera, and Michael Paul Chan.ORIGINAL CHARACTERBrenda Lee Johnson is a great character from her inability to say no to sweets to her obvious manipulations to get what she wants. I've adored Kyra Sedgwick since her role in ""Something To Talk About"" with Dennis Quaid and Julia Roberts. She was a total hoot in that film. I think she created Brenda Lee Johnson's persona from that same well of female toughness she used in that film to come up with a character who's single-minded and focused and good at really only one thing in life: solving crimes.BOTTOM LINEGet Season 1 of The Closer, and you'll spend several hours with a complicated crime-solving woman who will delight you with her intelligence, her incongruous southern manners, and her machiavellian maneuvers to get criminals to confess. You'll laugh at her inability to stay away from junkfood or to do anything well that doesn't involve police work.As Brenda Lee says, ""Thank you. Thank you very much.""",5,The Closer Caught Me,1297468800,"02 12, 2011",2011,2465,"['never', 'watched', 'Closer', 'TNT', 'started', 'showing', 'reruns', 'early', 'afternoon', 'time', 'slot', 'was', 'always', 'when', 'was', 'taking', 'break', 'pounding', 'keys', 'found', 'kicking', 'back', 'cup', 'tea', 'getting', 'acquainted', 'Deputy', 'Chief', 'Brenda', 'Lee', 'Johnson', 'played', 'superbly', 'Kyra', 'Sedgwick.Ms', 'Sedgwick', 'essence', 'steel', 'magnolias', 'character', 'real', 'personality', 'funny', 'thing', 'character', 'Brenda', 'Johnson', 'letter', 'white', 'glove', 'manners', 'were', 'taught', 'mothers', 'knees', 'miserably', 'observing', 'spirit', 'well-bred', 'manners', 'reality', 'abrupt', 'irritable', 'urban', 'female', 'there', 'yet', 'smile', 'utterances', 'thank', 'very', 'much', 'RERUNS', 'HOOKED', 'MESince', ""'d"", 'never', 'watched', 'show', 'found', 'reruns', 'inspired', 'curiosity', 'how', 'southern', 'belle', 'ended', 'up', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'how', 'Californians', 'team', 'came', 'accept', 'seemingly', 'always', 'angry', 'head', 'Priority', 'Murder', 'Not', 'mention', 'how', 'hooked', 'managed', 'keep', 'such', 'hottie', 'Jon', 'Tenney', 'who', 'Special', 'Agent', 'Fritz', 'Howard', 'love', 'interest.PRAISEThus', 'broke', 'down', 'ordered', 'Season', '1', 'DVD', 'worth', 'penny', ""'ve"", 'got', 'original', 'stories', 'are', 'keep', 'guessing', 'great', 'acting', 'Ms.', 'Sedgwick', 'Tenney', 'supporting', 'cast', 'made', 'J.', 'K.', 'Simmons', 'Corey', 'Reynolds', 'Raymond', 'Cruz', 'Robert', 'Gossett', 'G.', 'W.', 'Bailey', 'Tony', 'Dennison', 'Gina', 'Ravera', 'Michael', 'Paul', 'Chan.ORIGINAL', 'CHARACTERBrenda', 'Lee', 'Johnson', 'great', 'character', 'inability', 'say', 'sweets', 'obvious', 'manipulations', 'get', 'what', ""'ve"", 'adored', 'Kyra', 'Sedgwick', 'role', 'Something', 'Talk', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'was', 'total', 'hoot', 'film', 'think', 'created', 'Brenda', 'Lee', 'Johnson', 'persona', 'same', 'well', 'female', 'toughness', 'used', 'film', 'come', 'up', 'character', 'who', 'single-minded', 'focused', 'good', 'really', 'only', 'one', 'thing', 'life', 'solving', 'crimes.BOTTOM', 'LINEGet', 'Season', '1', 'Closer', ""'ll"", 'spend', 'several', 'hours', 'complicated', 'crime-solving', 'woman', 'who', 'will', 'delight', 'intelligence', 'incongruous', 'southern', 'manners', 'machiavellian', 'maneuvers', 'get', 'criminals', 'confess', ""'ll"", 'laugh', 'inability', 'stay', 'away', 'junkfood', 'do', 'anything', 'well', 'that', ""n't"", 'involve', 'police', 'work.As', 'Brenda', 'Lee', 'Thank', 'Thank', 'very', 'much']",N/A

However, I recognize that this is the way the character is supposed to be played.  She is supposed to be a very unlikable person.  That's why almost all of her co-workers dislike her and that is an important part of the show's plot.  She is supposed to be very hard to like but also to be extremely good at getting suspects to confess to their crimes.  That is the main premise of this series.  So since the actress is only playing the character as it was intended to be played, I can't really fault her performance just because it annoys me.However, she has another habit that also annoys me and this one is inherent in the show's writing.  She hides important information from her team of co-workers.  This is how the script is written but anyone who has had a lot of experience at problem solving in a work environment will you that this is a very ineffective way of solving problems.  It does not matter if you are THE BEST in your field, you will still solve problems more effectively if you fully share all important information with your team and solicit input from all of them.  In this case her team mostly dislikes her and so one can understand the temptation for her to behave this way, but it is unrealistic to expect consistently excellent results from doing so.  And yet she consistently produces the best possible outcomes despite working in a way that would almost never make that happen in reality.  And, to make it worse, many of the solutions she comes up with are kind of obvious and are sometimes even logically flawed.  That also annoys me and I blame the show's writers for this flaw and I have a harder time forgiving this one.Bottom line is I think this is just an okay show.

It was a star vehicle written for Kyra Sedgwich, but the secondary cast is outstanding.  They added some of the best character actors who had been in the business for years, and new ones to keep an eye on - in fact it was no surprise that they were so popular they kept them together for the follow up series.

The police drama, ""The Closer"", will open your eyes as Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson cracks each case by making them talk! It is that rarest of cable episodic shows: a clearly successful show on both a ratings and critical level that can slug it out with 'Big Four' network shows; and that has translated into a full order of second season shows. I only wish we could get 22 episodes per season from the cable networks. But the fact that it's on TNT, a network that prides itself on ""We know drama!"" , really helps. When was the last time you saw ANY network add 10 minutes to a season one finale or present the second season opener ""commercial free""? Am I the only one who was fascinated by those early trailers that showed a ticked-off Brenda leaving the interview room in a huff, while the accused lady demanded she get back in there and continue the questioning?  Wild stuff, for sure. I was hooked by the trailer, but the series pilot episode reeled me in. LOL. And the following S-1 episodes were just as strongly written and acted.Sporting a well-known star and a cast of fairly well-known character actors, ""The Closer"" is a revelation to those who haven't found this TNT show yet. Kyra Sedgwick is an amazing actress for those who don't know her work, and her characterization of Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh  Johnson stands out like a beacon among the best TV lead female characters in recent memory: a somewhat odd, sometimes humorous, but very determined police detective, who is not to be messed with. And it is great to see J. K. Simmons, Dr Emil Skoda on ""Law & Order"" and ""Spiderman 2"", get a well-deserved major role. Jon Tenney, Robert Gossett, G.W.Bailey, Anthony John Denison, and Tony-nominated Corey Reynolds round out the excellent ensemble. This show has me ""DVR-ing"" the network shows, so I can watch ""The Closer"" first.

She is a strong woman and what makes her awesome as a strong woman is she is in no way ""Overly Butch"" in a position of authority working with men who are hard edged cops.  I especially liked how most of the people she worked with did not actually like her when she arrived as a new fresh southern belle out of Georgia.I liked how the script writers had the men of her unit making snide fun at her accent and odd mannerisms behind her back and some did things to undercut her authority earlier on.  I liked how over time the writers gradually showed how she earned the respect of those who worked with her.  I like how she uses her southern charms to disarm some and flare up with fire and passion to others as needed.  The writers give Brenda Lee added demension as a character.  I like how they show how she thinks and eliminates aspects of the crime details till she reaches the solution.  While I loved Columbo in many ways and made it my business to buy every Columbo series from [...], I think Brenda Lee is his equal and is somehow made more real by her weird character flaws and quirks.Yes it would be way nice IF they added lots of featurettes and extras you see in DVD releases of mainline series but, for the money this is an awesome value.  I'd much rather enjoy all of the Closer Series than pay tons more for a few extras.  I must admit I Brenda Lee's gentle southern Georgia down home just plain folky accent is one of the biggest turn on's for me.  All things considered I like the closer because, the scripts are great the acting is great. Most of all I love the closer because the Brenda Lee character is full of heart, passion, down home plain old fashioned humble beginnings southern charm while being still an awesomely intelligent strong woman who speaks her mind.  Futhermore Brenda Lee regularly stands her ground with guts and gusto in a male dominated field a trait I think most young ladies need to see so they have a better chance of growing up to be strong, intelligent and self assured.  The weird wide screen format was a stupid decision on the studios part who knows why studio executives make the dumb choices they so often do.You can't beat the price od the closer when you factor in the sheer number and quality of the programs you get for this DVD investment.  If you like crime mystery and drama with a tinge of southern charm buying The Closer from [...] is a no brainer.  If this new next season of the closer is awesome as the first season was I will be buying that DVD set from [...] too unless the production company gets piggy wanting an arm and a leg kings ransom price for the 2nd season DVD set.Thanks TNT...Its nice to have the closer to go along with the steady diet of Law and Order you guys show.",5,I Love The Closer.

For the past 6 years, Kyra Sedgwick has played Chief of Major Case Squad, Brenda Lee Johnson. The series starts out when an old colleague, Chief Pope (J.K. Simmons), asks her to come from D.C. to L.A. to run a brand new division within the LAPD. She accepts and nobody is happy about it. They resent her for many reasons, such as, her past relationship with Pope, the fact that she's an outsider, the fact that she's a young woman, take your pick. Her job is to improve the closure rate on high profile crimes, but at the same time she's fighting her own people just to get things done. Sedgwick is absolutely amazing as Brenda Lee Johnson. She is such a smart woman and it shows in the way she portrays the Chief. The supporting cast are all terrific, and are in fact veterans of such successful shows as Oz, Law & Order, and MASH.

Not 'I don't like her character', I do not like the actress.That is the single flaw in this otherwise intriguing police drama.This show finds a unique place among the plethora of police/forensic shows out there.  Somewhere between Monk and Law & Order's Criminal Intent, this show focuses on the hardest part of police work: Interviewing witnesses & suspects and obtaining confessions that would really stand up in court.The attention is in the details.  One can follow the line of reasoning to discover the 'culprit' if one tries.  I like that.  The fact that while there are few convoluted plot twists, the answer isn't like the obscure murder/mystery while at the same time it is not dropped on the table without suspense.It's hard to say I really like this show at the same time disliking the actress playing the lead - that is a credit to the writers, director, and I have to admit, Kyra Sedgewick.The Character (Deputy Chief Brenda Johnson) has enough flaws to be human while being good enough at her job to keep from being fired - like others have said a strange presentation...At the same time, like other good dramas, things don't always work out - she's not a Canadian Mounty - she doesn't always 'get her man' - and she doesn't always get the confession.  Even when she does, in some cases, it is bitter fruit - like the episode when the really bad guy gets to walk because someone else confesses...  I'm sure that guy will be back in Season 2 or 3, and yes I'm waiting for their release on DVD.I only 'wish' someone else had been cast in the lead, but I'm having a hard time imagining who - but it is the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5.",4,A twist to the average crime drama/forensics show...,1156118400,"08 21, 2006",2006,1736,"['Let', 'start', 'simple', 'confession', 'own', 'Do', 'Not', 'Kyra', 'Sedgewick', 'Not', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'character', 'do', 'not', 'actress.That', 'single', 'flaw', 'otherwise', 'intriguing', 'police', 'drama.This', 'show', 'unique', 'place', 'plethora', 'police/forensic', 'out', 'there', 'Somewhere', 'Monk', 'Law', 'Order', 'Criminal', 'Intent', 'show', 'hardest', 'part', 'police', 'work', 'Interviewing', 'suspects', 'obtaining', 'confessions', 'would', 'really', 'stand', 'up', 'court.The', 'attention', 'details', 'One', 'can', 'follow', 'line', 'reasoning', 'discover', ""'culprit"", 'one', 'fact', 'are', 'few', 'convoluted', 'plot', 'twists', 'answer', ""n't"", 'obscure', 'murder/mystery', 'same', 'time', 'not', 'dropped', 'table', 'suspense.It', 'hard', 'say', 'really', 'show', 'same', 'time', 'disliking', 'actress', 'playing', 'lead', 'credit', 'writers', 'director', 'have', 'admit', 'Kyra', 'Sedgewick.The', 'Character', 'Deputy', 'Chief', 'Brenda', 'Johnson', 'enough', 'flaws', 'be', 'human', 'being', 'good', 'enough', 'job', 'keep', 'being', 'fired', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'strange', 'presentation', 'same', 'time', 'other', 'good', 'dramas', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'work', 'out', 'not', 'Canadian', 'Mounty', ""n't"", 'always', ""'get"", 'man', ""n't"", 'always', 'get', 'confession', 'Even', 'when', 'cases', 'bitter', 'fruit', 'episode', 'when', 'really', 'bad', 'guy', 'walk', 'someone', 'else', ""'m"", 'sure', 'guy', 'will', 'be', 'back', 'Season', '2', '3', 'yes', ""'m"", 'waiting', 'release', 'DVD.I', 'only', 'someone', 'else', 'had', 'been', 'cast', 'lead', ""'m"", 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'imagining', 'who', 'only', 'reason', '4', 'stars', 'instead', '5']",N/A

Simmons J.J. Jameson from ""Spider-Man"" and ""Spider-Man 2"") lead an elite unite that tackles high profile murder cases with her unusual approach to solving crimes. Her Georgia accent immediately sets her apart from her colleagues. She's much savvier underneath her down home accent than many give her credit for allowing her, like Columbo to tackle crimes that others might not be able to solve. Like Columbo and Monk she's got her own quirks (an addiction to junk food, she shows up at a crime scenes with her sick cat--named Cat--in a paper back and her southern charm can't quite hide her abrasive personality). It's a marvelous TV show with a terrific supporting cast (Jon Tenney, Robert Gossett among others). Unlike Columbo this show is much harder edged.""The Closer"" is presented in a goofy looking presentation; the show is presented in widescreen but because its not anamorphic when you watch it on a widescreen TV the images are stretched or boxed on the sides, bottom and top.  The presentation is rather bizarre and I can't quite figure out why they made this idiotic decision but, again, the show looks quite good despite this flaw. The colors are accurate with accurate skin tones. The show has a significant amount of dark sequences but that's the way the show is shot with lots of use of shadows and moody lighting dominating the look of the series. The audio sounds fine and is presented in 2.0 stereo surround as it was originally broadcast. It's primarily dialogue driven so there isn't a huge amount of surround type of effects.Unfortunately there are no featurettes on the development of the series, how Kyra Sedgewick became involved in the show, interviews with the supporting cast or a glimpse into the creative process of the show. We get deleted scenes for the bulk of the episodes (they were clearly cut for time constraints) presented with the time code at the bottom of the images so clearly most were cut prior to the final assembly of the show. No commentary tracks which is disappointing but the price is right for the show and it's presented in thin packs making it easier to store the DVDs without taking up much room.Well written, performed and directed ""The Closer"" looks solid in its DVD presentation but could be improved significantly for the second season. I'd suggest that Warner present the show anamorphically enhanced and include some featurettes or commentary tracks in addition to the deleted scenes. This top notch show one of the best of the season deserves a deluxe treatment but because it's on TNT and has a smaller audience it's unlikely we'll probably see either one of these improvements for future",4,"Great show, goofy presentation",1148428800,"05 24, 2006",2006,2891,"['great', 'well', 'written', 'show', 'great', 'performances', 'direction', 'Closer', 'Deputy', 'Chief', 'Police', 'Brenda', 'Leigh', 'Johnson', 'Kyra', 'Sedgwick', 'fish', 'water', 'lured', 'Atlanta', 'L.A.by', 'Assistant', 'Police', 'Chief', 'Will', 'Pope', 'J.K.', 'Simmons', 'J.J.', 'Jameson', 'Spider-Man', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'lead', 'elite', 'unite', 'high', 'murder', 'cases', 'unusual', 'approach', 'solving', 'crimes', 'Georgia', 'accent', 'immediately', 'apart', 'colleagues', 'much', 'savvier', 'down', 'home', 'accent', 'many', 'give', 'credit', 'allowing', 'Columbo', 'tackle', 'crimes', 'others', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'solve', 'Columbo', 'Monk', 'got', 'own', 'quirks', 'addiction', 'junk', 'food', 'up', 'crime', 'scenes', 'sick', 'cat', 'named', 'Cat', 'paper', 'back', 'southern', 'charm', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'hide', 'abrasive', 'personality', 'marvelous', 'TV', 'show', 'terrific', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Jon', 'Tenney', 'Robert', 'Gossett', 'others', 'Columbo', 'show', 'much', 'harder', 'edged', 'Closer', 'presented', 'goofy', 'looking', 'presentation', 'show', 'presented', 'widescreen', 'not', 'anamorphic', 'when', 'watch', 'widescreen', 'TV', 'images', 'are', 'stretched', 'boxed', 'sides', 'bottom', 'top', 'presentation', 'rather', 'bizarre', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'made', 'idiotic', 'decision', 'again', 'show', 'quite', 'good', 'flaw', 'colors', 'are', 'accurate', 'accurate', 'skin', 'tones', 'show', 'significant', 'amount', 'dark', 'sequences', 'way', 'show', 'shot', 'lots', 'use', 'shadows', 'moody', 'lighting', 'dominating', 'look', 'series', 'audio', 'sounds', 'fine', 'presented', '2.0', 'stereo', 'surround', 'was', 'originally', 'broadcast', 'primarily', 'dialogue', 'driven', 'so', ""n't"", 'huge', 'amount', 'surround', 'type', 'effects.Unfortunately', 'are', 'featurettes', 'development', 'series', 'how', 'Kyra', 'Sedgewick', 'became', 'involved', 'show', 'interviews', 'supporting', 'cast', 'glimpse', 'creative', 'process', 'show', 'get', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'bulk', 'episodes', 'were', 'clearly', 'cut', 'time', 'constraints', 'presented', 'time', 'code', 'bottom', 'images', 'so', 'clearly', 'most', 'were', 'cut', 'prior', 'final', 'assembly', 'show', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'disappointing', 'price', 'right', 'show', 'presented', 'thin', 'packs', 'making', 'easier', 'store', 'DVDs', 'taking', 'up', 'much', 'room.Well', 'written', 'performed', 'directed', 'Closer', 'solid', 'DVD', 'presentation', 'could', 'be', 'improved', 'significantly', 'second', 'season', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'Warner', 'present', 'show', 'anamorphically', 'enhanced', 'include', 'featurettes', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'addition', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'top', 'notch', 'show', 'one', 'best', 'season', 'deluxe', 'treatment', 'TNT', 'smaller', 'audience', 'unlikely', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'see', 'one', 'improvements', 'future']",N/A
