958908,A2LNZL599SPWFL,B000CNDJOO,"lightnshade ""lightnshade""","[78, 79]","I bought this because, like a lot of people, I'd seen Harvey on Celebrity Fit Club and thought I'd give it a go. I used to do martial arts and this is quite similar to the warm-up we used to do in that, so I know that this kind of work-out is very effective and combined with other forms of cardio exercise such as running, kickboxing, spinning etc...you will surely shape up.There is a 9 minute active warm-up plus three 11-12 minute circuits: beginner, intermediate and advanced. You march (or you may choose to do walk-hops or jog in place) on the spot between 15 different exercises such as press-ups, situps, star jumps, lunges, skipping, boxing, box-press, etc.The exercises are the same for all three 11-12 minute circuits. The difference is the intensity levels. The intermediate and advanced intensity options will make you sweat. However, if you choose to do the three circuits in the advanced level, you'll get a major workout!In this workout, Harvey just provides instructions. He has his stopwatch with him and stays at the sidelines giving reminders and pointers to the crew.He does present himself as a military bootcamp drill sergeant but then again, this is how the entire workout is presented (as you will notice from Harvey's and crew's attire to the set. The entire workout is focused on the crew though.Harvey explains everything as you go along, with 3 army members to follow: One does a beginner version, another does the intermediate, and the last does the advanced level; so you take your pick in the intensity. These exercises don't vary much between the different levels, but instead of marching, you do a little hop in the intermediate section and jog in the advanced one. You are encouraged to do as many reps as you can in the 30 seconds of each activity.The circuits don't get boring because each exercise only lasts for 30 seconds but you have a choice of whether to do the beginner or intermediate or advanced level (for example, you can march in place, or walk-hop or jog).You repeat each circuit (each containing 15 different excercises, covering all parts of the body) 3 times, with the pace gradually picking up, but Harvey keeps you motivated in a regimental no nonsense ""I know you can do it"" manner.Doing all three is an excellent workout, but you don't have to do it all at the beginning - we are told to build up to it. As one might expect Harvey is very motivational and spurs you along to do it.There is a military bootcamp feel in the entire workout. He keeps saying, ""Suck that gut in"" and ""Control your breathing, relax your breathing"" - two reminders that are really important. It could get annoying after a while but then you can just lower the volume. The reason for lowering the volume is so you can play your own music! The downside to this workout is that the music is very faint - BUT it's also good in the sense that you can just play your fave songs.In conclusion, I really enjoy this workout because it makes me sweat. I like basic and athletic choreography and this fits the bill. If you like complex choreography, you will not enjoy this workout. However, if you like no-nonsense, athletic but intense drill type of exercise, you will enjoy this DVD (just play your own music because you can hardly hear any in this workout!).The DVD is chaptered (warm-up, circuit 1, circuit 2, circuit 3, cool-down).",5,What A Workout!

958910,AT79BAVA063DG,B000CNDJOO,ReadNReVu,"[2, 2]","Good solid workout, easily adaptable if you are more or less advanced. Variety of exercises performed in 30-second circuits.What I didn't like:No detailed form pointers (he doesn't give much instruction during the 30 seconds). The three exercisers, in their quest to knock out as many reps as possible, showed very poor form as the workout levels progressed. You're just wasting your time if you're not doing the exercises correctly, and worse, you could injure yourself. A separate chapter showing proper form and variations (especially as the names he used for some of the exercises may or may not be familiar to you right off the bat) would be welcome if this DVD were ever redone.Sound was rather garbled, and it didn't help that he was competing with the sound of marching on the floor. This made for too much standing around when instructions were given, when you could have/should have been marching or stretching.  If this had been filmed outside on grass, this would not have been an issue. Lack of music didn't bother me, but it would have been nice if he'd counted cadence out loud (and simply speeded it up in the advanced workouts), so that you could get in a rhythm, and avoid the problem I mention in the previous paragraph, as well as making sure you work both sides evenly when necessary.Finally, would have preferred more total-body active stretching in the cool-down, instead of going through much of the warm-up backwards. All of the stretching is done while standing.Good workout, especially as far as cardio.  And Gunnery Sergeant Walden was very restrained in this DVD, all things considered--the reviewer who wrote that he was yelling throughout does not understand the concept of the boot camp experience.",4,"Could use some improvement, but good workout",1202342400,"02 7, 2008",2008,1730,"['Good', 'solid', 'workout', 'easily', 'adaptable', 'are', 'more', 'less', 'advanced', 'Variety', 'exercises', 'performed', '30-second', 'circuits.What', 'did', ""n't"", 'detailed', 'form', 'pointers', ""n't"", 'give', 'much', 'instruction', '30', 'seconds', 'three', 'exercisers', 'quest', 'knock', 'out', 'many', 'reps', 'possible', 'showed', 'very', 'poor', 'form', 'workout', 'levels', 'progressed', ""'re"", 'just', 'wasting', 'time', ""'re"", 'not', 'doing', 'exercises', 'correctly', 'worse', 'could', 'injure', 'separate', 'chapter', 'showing', 'proper', 'form', 'variations', 'especially', 'names', 'used', 'exercises', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'familiar', 'right', 'bat', 'would', 'be', 'welcome', 'DVD', 'were', 'ever', 'redone.Sound', 'was', 'rather', 'garbled', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'was', 'competing', 'sound', 'marching', 'floor', 'made', 'too', 'much', 'standing', 'around', 'when', 'instructions', 'were', 'given', 'when', 'could', 'have/should', 'have', 'been', 'marching', 'stretching', 'had', 'been', 'filmed', 'grass', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'issue', 'Lack', 'music', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', ""'d"", 'counted', 'cadence', 'loud', 'simply', 'speeded', 'up', 'advanced', 'workouts', 'so', 'could', 'get', 'rhythm', 'avoid', 'problem', 'mention', 'previous', 'paragraph', 'as', 'well', 'making', 'sure', 'work', 'sides', 'evenly', 'when', 'necessary.Finally', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'more', 'total-body', 'active', 'stretching', 'cool-down', 'instead', 'going', 'much', 'warm-up', 'backwards', 'stretching', 'done', 'standing.Good', 'workout', 'especially', 'as', 'far', 'cardio', 'Gunnery', 'Sergeant', 'Walden', 'was', 'very', 'restrained', 'DVD', 'things', 'considered', 'reviewer', 'who', 'wrote', 'was', 'yelling', 'not', 'understand', 'concept', 'boot', 'camp', 'experience']","Fighting Fit, Fighting Fat Club with Harvey Walden"

Not only is Harvey Walden unconvincing in his role as drill sargeant, he lacks passion as is evident by the body language and expressions of the exercisers in the video.  Unlike other excercise gurus, he does not exercise WITH you, instead he stands on the sidelines and barks out commands. The production quality is very low budget.  It looks like it was shot using a  camcorder. The set is bland and melancholy, and THERE IS NO MUSIC! All you hear is the loud marching of the feet of the exercisers, who display NO enthusiasm at all.  And, I for one, can't blame them.  I only hope they got paid for what must have been an extremely painful project for them. I was never more bored in my life.  Walden's cuing is off, and furthermore, it is difficult to follow an excercise instructor who does not do the moves with you.  That's just crazy.  What was he thinking?  I have no words to describe how awful this video is. I wish I could give it 0 stars.  Don't waste your money.  PLEASE!!!!  The other reviewers must be new to exercise because I can't understand how they couldn't see that this video lacks what an experienced exerciser would expect.
