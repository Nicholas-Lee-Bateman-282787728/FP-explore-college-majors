1069209,A2PV6GK1HV54Y9,B000P6YNTI,ADRIENNE MILLER,"[3, 5]","Desperate Housewives - The Complete Third Season was another solid and juicy season of the prime-time soap. I thought Marcia Cross stole the show the second season and Felicity Huffman had the best year the third. She is such a great actress, glad to hear she's nominated for an Emmy. Teri Hatcher is still annoying to watch and Eva Longoria is as vain and spoiled as ever as the newly-divorced Gaby. Even Nicolette Sheridan got a chance to shine this season as she took over for Cross who was on maternity leave. Some weird plots like Orson and his creepy and very botoxed mother played by Dixie Carter. My favorite episode is defintely Bang! the episode where Laurie Metcalf held up the neigborhood grocery store in Fairvew. Well just another day in Wisteria Lane for these desperate mama's. I highly recommend buying season three as well as the other seasons. Enjoy your dirty laundry!",5,Who's the best?

1069213,A2EO3TWW174F7P,B000P6YNTI,"Cameron Dimez ""GM Custom Jewelry Owner""","[6, 15]","Desperate Housewives- Starring Teri Hatcher, Felicity Huffman, Marcia Cross, Eva Longoria, Nicollette Sheridan and Kyle Maclachlan.When Season Two finished critics had groaned, fans were disappointed, and over 2 million viewers tuned out for good. Was season two really that abyssal that it deserved every bit of criticism it received? Not exactly, but it was needed to open creator Marc Cherry's eyes and get him more involved in his creation, because clearly who ever stepped in wasn't sure what they were doing. So Cherry buckled down and cut his summer break short and got together with his team of amateur writers (except a select few) and tried to develop a more exciting, engaging, and explosive season other than the lackluster one we were stuck with last year. There were a few improvements made. When the season premiere played on my television set in September, I agreed with Cherry, he had gotten back on track. The characters were back to their old selves, Susan *had* a storyline, the mystery was mysterious, and the housewives actually got to have some scenes together. But there was the bad news, the dialog wasn't near as sharp, some storylines were completely unoriginal, and they stole the whole lunch scene from Sex and the City. I began to wonder if Desperate Housewives was another Six Feet Under, great for a season, lacks for a few more, and then becomes so dreary with infinite plot lines that didn't work from day one that you don't even want to know how it finishes because you don't care. There are of course a few things that made this season memorable, and some not so much.The Good:I liked Bree's arc until the season finale. It was a little unrealistic that she was on a honeymoon for 3 months, but it was a decent cover up for Marcia's  maternal leave mid season. I enjoyed Susan's arc for the first episode, then it became boring, same with Lynette. Gabrielle had some great scenes with Xiao Mei, and I still have no idea why they got rid of her, she had great potential. There were a few very good episodes. For the most part, the storylines ended well. The Orson/Alma mystery had its moments of brilliance. I also liked the shows darker suburban tones, and two mysteries that didn't involve a murder. Art was another character they gave the ax to prematurely. It was nice to see more Edie, although I didn't much care for her transition into the needy romantic post Bree's departure. I was thankful they didn't drag the Susan/Mike relationship on any longer; I rooted for them for season one, but by mid season two I was almost yelling ""just marry her already!"". I enjoyed watching Lynette deal with Rick. Carlos and Gabrielle's divorce also had its moments of brilliance. One of the best scenes between them was when he threw her out of his car on the way home. I still think she needs her comeuppance which I expect Victor will deliver in Season Four. The hostage situation, and the Bigsby's, Bree finding a good husband, and an evil mother in law. I also thank the writers for adding the many household tricks in Bree's dialog. I would have never have learned that sour cream makes a moist pound cake, or that salt is used to get rid of red wine stains.The bad:Jokes? What jokes? Either I missed them because they weren't funny, or there was a serious lack of them. Most of the new characters; they all lacked personality. Austin, Alma, Ian, Nora, hell, everyone except for Rick, Art, Rebecca, Carolyn and Gloria completely bored me. The outcome of Gabrielle's baby story was lame, and stolen from Nip/Tuck I might add. I didn't think it was smart to steal plot lines from Sex and the City, which is still the superior show. There wasn't much screen time for Bree, which again I understand because of Marcia's pregnancy, but it's still a fault. The many inconsistencies; where did Justin and Bongo disappear to? What happened to Orson hating Mike? I admit, I too missed Andrew when he was a psychopath. There were also many mediocre episodes this season. Nothing exciting, nothing boring, just plain. Gabrielle's general storyline after Carlos and her broke up. Didn't care for Rex's narration, couldn't they have brought him in a flashback or something? I also found it very weird how everyone in the neighborhood magically became friends with one another. Since when did Tom talk to Carlos about their wives? And the whole teenage love triangle thing was extremely corny. This is Desperate Housewives, not The O.C.The Ugly:The return of... Zack? I like his character, but why did they have to do hitch him with Gabrielle. After he killed his grandfather to gain his fortune, they could have done anything, and they chose that? I hated the way a lot of scenes were written. Cherry's new writers were mostly from old sitcoms and it showed. Most of the time I was just waiting to hear a laugh track. I don't even want to mention what Alma did to Orson. Who thought of that? Gabrielle lost her baby... again. The only thing that's different is that no one cares. I hated the way they handled Bree's wedding.Most of these varied from an episode to episode basis. There were a handful of great episodes such as:Episode 6: Sweetheart, I Have to ConfessThis was the best episode of the season. Very well written, actually funny, and mysterious. AEpisode 7: BangThough it wasn't as good as I thought it would be, mainly because of Gabrielle and Carlos (the feud got old last episode), one of the best episodes of the series. A-Episode 10: The Miracle SongThey finally made a holiday episode. It was very well written, and there were lots of twists and turns. AEpisode 15: The Little Things You Do TogetherLynette and Tom finally open up their restaurant, and it didn't come off cheesy either. The mystery wraps up, but wasn't as for filling as Season One or Two. A-Then there were the ones that weren't so good:Episode 2: It Takes TwoAll four housewives had horrible storylines. And where was Edie? C-Episode 13: Come Play With MeZack and Alma single handedly ruined this whole episode. Worst episode of the season. DEpisode 16: My Husband, the PigOut of character, cheesy, boring. Didn't like anything from this episode either. CEpisode 17: Dress BigThis episode was just incredibly boring. Lynette's over-reacting to Tom was too melodramatic. C+Episode 23: Getting Married TodayThe only reason why this episode is on the 'worst' list is because it was the season finale, and nothing exciting happened. Plus the cliffhanger was lame. C+Overall this was just another ok season. I really do think this is following in the footsteps of Six Feet Under. There are a few promising storylines for Season Four, but I doubt they will go anywhere they haven't before. Plus, there was no new mystery introduced except for the fate of Edie, which is pretty obvious. I won't spoil it, but if you're interested in learning the truth, listen to Marcia's interview on Letterman.I will add more to this review when I have a chance to look through the DVD.",3,"An

1069216,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000P6YNTI,"Cloud ""...""","[0, 0]","Part of the show's success came from the fact that a lot of people can relate to a lot of the women on Wisteria Lane. From the mother struggling to make ends meet with maybe a bit too many kids to the one obsessed with image and perfectness to the misunderstand promiscuous neighbour, it seems kind of strange that men can find as much to like as the women do. Sure it helps the women are attractive and the season has enough intrigue, drama and humor to keep you coming back whether you're a guy or a girl.On Susan's story, Mike has been put into a coma after being run over by Orson, Bree's new man. Susan meets Ian in the hospital and finds herself drawn into him while waiting for Mike to wake up. As for Bree, Orson's former wife Alma is missing and blame is put on Orson with Bree skeptical about who Orson really is. The divorce between Carlos and Gabby is nearly finalized and the 2 come to blows and trying to find other relationships including Edie for the former and a mayoral candidate for the latter. Meanwhile, Lynette deals with the new woman in her life, namely Nora who had a child with Tom before he met Lynette and Tom tries to get his dream, a pizzeria, off the ground.Despite the fact it wasn't a nicely-praised season, I barely watched season 2. I kind of lost interest in the show or started to watch others so I just never watched. Season 3 has been seen as a return-to-form and while it doesn't really match the first season's brilliance, it still is a great watch. From the plot twists to cliffhangers to the comedic moments (Susan's overreaction to possible wedding cakes for one) are just as good as the first year. The show only slows down when Bree leaves on vacation - which was to tie into Marcia Cross' pregnancy - and the show just doesn't really intrigue anymore. Sure other storylines come to the forefront but you feel something's missing.One of the show's strength was always its writing which always managed to blend the more outrageous comedic elements with character drama (the big one being the episode ""Bang"") and have it all fit together. From the playful narration of Mary Alice to the fights characters have with each other, it never manages to feel soap opera-ish even though a huge chunk of it tends to take its plays from the soap opera playbook like dead people who aren't dead to affairs and secrets upon secrets. My one complaint is that at times this season's arc felt a little disconnected from the 4 as a group. The first season had the women's lives rocked by the suicide of one of their friends which united them in their search for what happened and why she did while this season tends to have their own storylines separate from everyone elses with a meeting now and then.Extras are slightly disappointing. We get moment favorites and a look behind the scenes but nary a single commentary is disappointing but still, it's the show that matters and thankfully this is just as guilty pleasure as the show can do.",4,Good guilty pleasure TV,1189641600,"09 13, 2007",2007,2968,"['Part', 'show', 'success', 'came', 'fact', 'lot', 'people', 'can', 'relate', 'lot', 'women', 'Wisteria', 'Lane', 'mother', 'struggling', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'maybe', 'bit', 'too', 'many', 'kids', 'one', 'obsessed', 'image', 'perfectness', 'misunderstand', 'promiscuous', 'neighbour', 'kind', 'strange', 'men', 'can', 'find', 'as', 'much', 'like', 'women', 'do', 'Sure', 'women', 'are', 'attractive', 'season', 'enough', 'intrigue', 'drama', 'humor', 'keep', 'coming', 'back', ""'re"", 'guy', 'girl.On', 'Susan', 'story', 'Mike', 'been', 'put', 'coma', 'being', 'run', 'over', 'Orson', 'Bree', 'new', 'man', 'Susan', 'Ian', 'hospital', 'drawn', 'waiting', 'Mike', 'wake', 'up', 'Bree', 'Orson', 'former', 'wife', 'Alma', 'missing', 'blame', 'put', 'Orson', 'Bree', 'skeptical', 'who', 'Orson', 'really', 'divorce', 'Carlos', 'Gabby', 'nearly', 'finalized', '2', 'come', 'blows', 'trying', 'find', 'other', 'relationships', 'including', 'Edie', 'former', 'mayoral', 'candidate', 'latter', 'Meanwhile', 'Lynette', 'new', 'woman', 'life', 'namely', 'Nora', 'who', 'had', 'child', 'Tom', 'met', 'Lynette', 'Tom', 'tries', 'get', 'dream', 'pizzeria', 'ground.Despite', 'fact', 'was', ""n't"", 'nicely-praised', 'season', 'barely', 'watched', 'season', '2', 'kind', 'lost', 'interest', 'show', 'started', 'watch', 'others', 'so', 'just', 'never', 'watched', 'Season', '3', 'been', 'seen', 'return-to-form', ""n't"", 'really', 'match', 'first', 'season', 'brilliance', 'still', 'great', 'watch', 'plot', 'twists', 'cliffhangers', 'comedic', 'moments', 'Susan', 'overreaction', 'possible', 'wedding', 'cakes', 'one', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'year', 'show', 'only', 'down', 'when', 'Bree', 'vacation', 'was', 'tie', 'Marcia', 'Cross', 'pregnancy', 'show', 'just', ""n't"", 'really', 'intrigue', 'anymore', 'Sure', 'other', 'storylines', 'come', 'forefront', 'feel', 'something', 'missing.One', 'show', 'strength', 'was', 'always', 'writing', 'always', 'managed', 'blend', 'more', 'outrageous', 'comedic', 'elements', 'character', 'drama', 'big', 'one', 'being', 'episode', 'Bang', 'have', 'fit', 'together', 'playful', 'narration', 'Mary', 'Alice', 'fights', 'characters', 'have', 'other', 'never', 'feel', 'soap', 'opera-ish', 'even', 'huge', 'chunk', 'take', 'plays', 'soap', 'opera', 'playbook', 'dead', 'people', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'dead', 'affairs', 'secrets', 'secrets', 'one', 'complaint', 'times', 'season', 'arc', 'felt', 'little', 'disconnected', '4', 'group', 'first', 'season', 'had', 'women', 'lives', 'rocked', 'suicide', 'one', 'friends', 'united', 'search', 'what', 'happened', 'why', 'did', 'season', 'have', 'own', 'storylines', 'separate', 'everyone', 'meeting', 'now', 'then.Extras', 'are', 'slightly', 'disappointing', 'get', 'moment', 'favorites', 'look', 'scenes', 'nary', 'single', 'commentary', 'disappointing', 'still', 'show', 'matters', 'thankfully', 'just', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'show', 'can', 'do']",Desperate Housewives: Season 3

1069221,A2MZ1VBYTQ7MO5,B000P6YNTI,Joseph Haggard Jr.,"[46, 52]","After a good though not great second season, ""Desperate Housewives"" got back to full form for its third season. Even though season three wasn't as good as the first season, it was definitely better than the second season. Teri Hatcher (Susan), Felicity Huffman (Lynette), Marcia Cross (Bree), Eva Longoria (Gaby), and Nicollette Sheridan (Edie) all return for more hijinks on Wisteria Lane (located in the fictional town of Fairview), which saw plenty of the usual ingredients (romance, sex, murder, secrets, etc.) mixed in with its share of sharp comedy, serious drama, and intriguing mysteries that have been frequently featured in its first two seasons. Other series' regulars who came back for season three include James Denton (Mike), Ricardo Chivara (Carlos), Doug Savant (Tom), Andrea Bowen (Julie), and narrator Brenda Strong (Mary Alice).After the disappointing storyline involving the Applewhites of season two, creator Marc Cherry and his staff of writers came up with a storyline for season three that was far more intriguing. This starts with a new character for the third season: Orson Hodge (well played by Kyle MacLachlan). As most fans of this show know, Orson was first introduced late in season two, and played a major role in the last episode of the second season, which led to a bigger role in season three. As we began to sense in the season two finale, Orson was someone with a troubled past. This led to him hitting Mike with his car (Mike was suspicious of Orson), and then in the final scene starts having a relationship with Bree (who met Orson at the psychiatric hospital that she checked herself into after thinking she was about to have a nervous breakdown after dumping her son Andrew (Shawn Pyfrom) along the side of a road in the middle of nowhere and daughter Danielle (Joy Lauren) running away from home). In the first episode of season three (which begins 6 months after the end of season two), we start to know some of Orson's past, and it's not pretty. But his relationship with Bree brings some joy into his life, and they marry in the second episode. But the journey into marriage turns incredibly bumpy when Bree starts to sense some of the things that have haunted Orson's past, and some of those elements come back, most notably in the form of his crazy mother, the return of a previous wife (who everyone thought was missing and presumed dead), and the mystery involving a dead woman who Orson had an affair with. All these situations are put to good use and in the end the payoff delivers. Though the end of this storyline comes sooner than anticipated, thanks in part to Marcia Cross' real-life pregnancy. Shortly after production began on the third season, Cross announced that she was pregnant, which kind of put a little bump in the road for what Cherry was planning for the season. He didn't want to make Bree pregnant, so he and his crew devised ways so that we don't notice Cross' pregnancy in the episodes by having constant close-up shots of her face or putting items in front of her in many scenes. If there was a scene where Bree had to perform a minor stunt, a body double was used (such as a moment where Bree walks up a ladder). And when Cross was ordered to stay on bed rest for the remainder of her pregnancy (with twins), she invited the crew to come to her home to shoot some scenes. As a result the storyline ended two-thirds of the way into the season, which allowed Cross to go on maternity leave from the show. But no need to fear, Bree makes a triumphant return in the final episode. Thank goodness, because of all these desperate housewives she has become my personal favorite. ""Desperate Housewives"" slightly lagged a bit without her perfectionist attitude.Besides MacLachlan, there were other interesting new characters that get introduced. Dougray Scott was superb as Ian, an Englishman who strikes up a relationship with Susan; Josh Henderson is excellent as Edie's bad boy hunky nephew Austin, who starts a sweet romance with Susan's daughter Julie; Valerie Mahaffey is terrific as Orson's previous wife Alma, who appears in the first episode, then disappears for a while before reappearing at the mid-point of the season (much to Bree's shock); John Lafferty is very good as Gaby's new beau (and Fairview mayoral candidate) Victor Lang; Kiersten Warren is obnoxiously hilarious as Nora, (first introduced in the season two finale) an incredibly annoying woman who Tom had a one night stand with years ago and got pregnant with his child before he married Lynette, and tried to wreck havoc on the Scavo household by trying to get Tom back; Rachel Fox is cute as a button as Nora's daughter Kayla, who also happens to be Tom's daughter; Laurie Metcalf (from TV's ""Roseanne"") is memorably menacing as Carolyn, a friend of Alma's who suspects Orson murdered her; and the great Dixie Carter (from TV's ""Designing Women"") is a hoot as Orson's evil mother Gloria.While new characters popped up in season three, there were some old characters from the previous two seasons that turned up as well. Mark Moses and Cody Kasch returned for a couple of episodes as Paul Young and his troubled son Zack (who actually was Mike's son); Jesse Metcalfe shows up in an early episode as Gaby's former gardener (and lover) John; Richard Burgi turns up briefly as Susan's ex-husband Karl; and Steven Culp returns to narrate an episode as Bree's late husband Rex (Mary Alice got the day off on that episode).While there have been so many memorable characters on ""Desperate Housewives"", there is a reoccurring character who's so funny on the show that it would be a shame if I did not mention her. And that character is the old cranky Wisteria Lane neighbor Mrs. McClusky, played to the hilt by Kathryn Joosten. First introduced back in season one, Mrs. McClusky was at complete odds with just about everyone, especially Lynette. But since then she has started to show a softer side that is wonderfully touching. She's now good friends with Lynette, and helps out the Scavo family by babysitting their kids while Lynette and Tom are at work. The character even had a minor storyline late in season three that involved her late husband. This character has become one of the best things on ""Desperate Housewives"", and Joosten is perfect in the role. She's already won an Emmy for the role (as Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for season one). This character doesn't appear in every episode of the show, but for the episodes that she does turn up in (whether its one scene or five scenes) brings a smile to my face, which is usually followed by laughter. This character provides some of the biggest laughs on the show.During its first three seasons, there have been many great episodes of ""Desperate Housewives"". But the very best episode of the show so far (in my opinion) comes in season three. Episode 7, titled ""Bang"", is the bone-chilling, on-the-edge-of-your-seat episode about that supermarket hostage crisis that affects the residents of Wisteria Lane. This episode has all the elements: some big laughs, high drama, and suspenseful thrills. Plus, Laurie Metcalf gives a great performance in this episode as Carolyn, the crazed woman who literally snaps after hearing some very disturbing news and proceeds to go off the deep end by taking some residents of Wisteria Lane hostage at the supermarket. This episode is an absolute must-see.""Desperate Housewives"" - The Complete Third Season should be out on DVD before the start of the fourth season, and I encourage anyone who bailed out on the show after season two to go out and get it the moment it becomes available. Until then, you'll have to catch reruns of season three throughout the summer. Or you can view seasons one and two, already out on DVD as well as reruns airing on Lifetime. But one way or another, the third season of ""Desperate Housewives"" is a winner. And the season ends with another stunning cliffhanger, which will lead into season four.*** ADDITIONAL COMMENTS ***Since this review I watched these episodes again on DVD, and I need to bump my original rating of 5 stars down to 4 1/2 stars. Don't get me wrong, this is still an excellent season of ""Desperate Housewives"", but I had a few annoying quibbles about it while watching the episodes on DVD. And all of this takes place in the second half of the season. First off, the character of Ian started to get on my nerves in the later episodes. If you recall, Susan started dating Ian while Mike was in a coma from his accident at the end of season two. Susan fell in love with Ian, but not long after Mike woke up for his coma he wanted Susan back. And every time there was a scene where Mike and Susan shared a moment together and Ian either saw it or heard about it, Ian would constantly complain about it over and over again. I started to get really tired of hearing him complaining about Mike. It's like you just want to shout out at the character: ""quit your whining!"" Another setback was the behavior of Lynette's husband Tom. This (which also takes place during the last part of the season) deals with Tom's job as the owner of his new pizza parlor. After hiring wife Lynette to be the manager, they start disagreeing on certain things, but this storyline takes a slight detour when a new character is introduced. After Tom suffers a major back spasm that requires bed rest, Lynette hires Rick (played by Jason Gedrick), who's a master chef. During the course of these later episodes, it seems that Lynette and Rick are attrached to each other, and that drives Tom into a jealous rage. Plus while Tom is at home recuperating from his back problems, he starts having angry fits that I found to be kind of unpleasant. I only wish that the writers could have found a better way to handle these situations. But in the end all the resolutions turn out to be good, and the show moves on. But because these two storylines got a little irritating during the second half of season three, I now give ""Desperate Housewives"" 4 1/2 stars.",5,Desperate Housewives - Season Three,1179878400,"05

Bree, Gaby, Susan, Lynette, and, yes, Edie weren't kept apart from each other the whole season (see what I mean about season 2?), there was a great mystery, and genius guest star casting (Ernie Hudson, Mike Farrell, Polly Bergen, Greg Evigan, and, above all, Laurie Metcalfe).After reading a lot of other reviews I'll spare regurgitating plot points. I will say Eva Longoria should have won an Emmy for this season. Yeah, Gaby tends to come off as spoiled, self-centered, etc. but she really was fleshed out with the divorce from Carlos. Ms. Longoria's (Mrs. Parker's?) non-verbal reactions to situations say more than any line of dialogue.

We finished it in three days, which wasn't so bad really...The Good:1. Susan & Mike finally get married. This happens in the Season Finale. Through this season, Susan meets a British dude called Ian but thankfully he dumps her.2. Bree gets married to Orson Hodge : Played by Kyle MacLachlan, this was my favorite new character this season. The role was very poorly written but the actor does a terrific job.3. Andrew Van De Kamp comes home : The homeless gay son of Bree finally returns and becomes a series regular this season, though some elements here are a bit controversial (drug usage, gay prostitution, etc)4. Edie and Carlos get together : A very unusual coupling, but it works. Edie attempts suicide in the season finale. You must watch!5. Gabrielle Solis marries the Town Mayor : He only does it for the Latino vote, and Gabby finds this out only after she marries him. Oh woe.The Bad:1. Ridiculous Sub Plots2. Teri Hatchers' over the top antics and dialogue3. 45 year olds behaving like 15 year olds4. Julie Meyer loses her virginity to Edie's nephew in the most boring and dull storyline ever5. Bree's daughter gets pregnant and sent away - this wasn't very interesting6. Lynette almost has an affair. Later, she gets lymphoma. Overall this wasn't a good year for her character.All things considered, this season really came together. My favorite characters, namely Andrew Van De Kamp and Tom Scavo, all get a lot more screen time, and Felicity Huffman acts REALLY well this entire season.If youre looking for a fictional fun soap-opera type series to lose yourself into, this is perfect.

1069232,A2WZ1B92F81LJJ,B000P6YNTI,"Olly Buxton ""@electricray""","[11, 13]","I am pinching myself: there is not a single 1 or 2 star review for this series out of 88. How can that be? What have I missed? I really couldn't stand this show (why did I watch it through, you ask? The furtherance of my own marital relations required it).Seasons 1 and 2 had a real originality and freshness: an unusual combination of romantic farce and dark thriller which made them compulsive viewing. But the formula seems to have been changed for Season 3. In the intervening period I've been treated to some really outstanding television in the shape ofDeadwood, The Sopranos andThe Wire- so perhaps I'm now seeing all of Desperate Housewives for what it really is, but I don't think it's that. When it started, Desperate Housewives was on that level. This series really seems to be inferior to the first ones.Firstly, the series-long continuity of plotlines which was a feature of the first two series is gone. As is the morbid undertone, and the genuinely fractious family relationships: now the guignol is played purely for (cheap) laughs. The real brutality is perpetrated by the scriptwriters who seem to have grown ever more panicked as the series progressed: developing characters and plot lines are hacked to death and their bodies carelessly jettisoned nearly every episode. At one point they resort to having almost all the characters assemble at a supermarket to be held up by a gun-wielding homicidal maniac, in so doing conveniently terminating about three (admittedly moribund) plot-lines with one tin of tomatoes.Characters we know from previous series behave entirely contrary to their established type: hard-man Mike Delfino (admittedly with the excuse of a severe blow to the head) becomes a hopeless and gormless romantic; Edie Britt stops being a shrew; Lynette Sciavo starts being one, and becomes an hysterical witch-hunter, then a cocquette; Andrew Van der Kamp abandons almost his sociopathic tendencies;  we are introduced to and then lose, without regard to story or character arc, a series of wooden characters such as Iain Hainsworth (who apparently really is a Brit, despite sounding like Mike Myers' impersonation of one), the wife-of-the-person-having-an-affair-with-the-former-mistress-of-Bree's-new-husband, Orson Hodge's ""dead"" wife; Orson's mother, Edie's nephew; Edie's estranged son; Tom Sciavo's ex girlfriend and their daughter; even creepy Zach makes a half-hearted return and disappears.Not a hint of structure; not a hint of direction; just a ghastly assemblance of stupid and irritating plotlines which seem to have been harvested from the Dynasty and Falcon Crest reject bin. You shouldn't expect to get away with this simply by rebranding it as ""comedy"" - but judging by the average reaction on this site, they did!It's just too ghastly to countenance. We have bodies in freezers, bodies buried in backyards, bodies in kitchens, bodies in gardens, bodies in supermarkets, bodies coming back from the dead, coming back from comas, going out from comas, at least seven or eight characters in hospital, we have characters falling out of carparks, falling out of windows, falling off ladders, falling off rooves, we have on-again-off-again allegations of insanity, pedophilia, infidelity, spousal homicide and an utter overdose of love triangles and other types of love geometry - tracking who is shagging whom is so hard that you are caused to doubt the very foundation of the space-time continuum of love itself.And I haven't even got onto the truly exasperating Susan Myer. Perhaps best if I don't, come to think of it.Olly Buxton",1,Desperate Housewives Jump The Shark,1207353600,"04 5, 2008",2008,3580,"['am', 'pinching', 'not', 'single', '1', '2', 'star', 'review', 'series', '88', 'How', 'can', 'be', 'What', 'have', 'missed', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'show', 'why', 'did', 'watch', 'ask', 'furtherance', 'own', 'marital', 'relations', 'required', '1', '2', 'had', 'real', 'originality', 'freshness', 'unusual', 'combination', 'romantic', 'farce', 'dark', 'thriller', 'made', 'compulsive', 'viewing', 'formula', 'have', 'been', 'changed', 'Season', '3', 'intervening', 'period', ""'ve"", 'been', 'treated', 'really', 'outstanding', 'television', 'shape', 'ofDeadwood', 'Sopranos', 'andThe', 'Wire-', 'perhaps', ""'m"", 'now', 'seeing', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'what', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'When', 'started', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'was', 'level', 'series', 'really', 'be', 'inferior', 'first', 'ones.Firstly', 'series-long', 'continuity', 'plotlines', 'was', 'feature', 'first', 'two', 'series', 'gone', 'morbid', 'undertone', 'genuinely', 'fractious', 'family', 'relationships', 'now', 'guignol', 'played', 'purely', 'cheap', 'real', 'brutality', 'perpetrated', 'scriptwriters', 'who', 'seem', 'have', 'grown', 'ever', 'more', 'panicked', 'series', 'progressed', 'developing', 'characters', 'plot', 'lines', 'are', 'hacked', 'death', 'bodies', 'carelessly', 'jettisoned', 'nearly', 'episode', 'one', 'point', 'resort', 'having', 'almost', 'characters', 'assemble', 'supermarket', 'be', 'held', 'up', 'gun-wielding', 'homicidal', 'maniac', 'so', 'doing', 'conveniently', 'terminating', 'three', 'admittedly', 'moribund', 'plot-lines', 'one', 'tin', 'tomatoes.Characters', 'know', 'previous', 'series', 'behave', 'entirely', 'contrary', 'established', 'type', 'hard-man', 'Mike', 'Delfino', 'admittedly', 'excuse', 'severe', 'blow', 'head', 'hopeless', 'gormless', 'romantic', 'Edie', 'Britt', 'being', 'shrew', 'Lynette', 'Sciavo', 'being', 'one', 'hysterical', 'witch-hunter', 'then', 'cocquette', 'Andrew', 'Van', 'der', 'Kamp', 'almost', 'sociopathic', 'tendencies', 'are', 'introduced', 'then', 'lose', 'regard', 'story', 'character', 'arc', 'series', 'wooden', 'characters', 'such', 'Iain', 'Hainsworth', 'who', 'apparently', 'really', 'Brit', 'sounding', 'Mike', 'Myers', 'impersonation', 'one', ""wife-of-the-person-having-an-affair-with-the-former-mistress-of-Bree's-new-husband"", 'Orson', 'Hodge', 'dead', 'wife', 'Orson', 'mother', 'Edie', 'nephew', 'Edie', 'estranged', 'son', 'Tom', 'Sciavo', 'ex', 'girlfriend', 'daughter', 'even', 'creepy', 'Zach', 'half-hearted', 'return', 'disappears.Not', 'hint', 'structure', 'not', 'hint', 'direction', 'just', 'ghastly', 'assemblance', 'stupid', 'irritating', 'plotlines', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'harvested', 'Dynasty', 'Falcon', 'Crest', 'reject', 'bin', 'should', ""n't"", 'expect', 'get', 'away', 'simply', 'rebranding', 'comedy', 'judging', 'average', 'reaction', 'site', 'did', 'just', 'too', 'ghastly', 'countenance', 'have', 'bodies', 'freezers', 'bodies', 'buried', 'backyards', 'bodies', 'kitchens', 'bodies', 'gardens', 'bodies', 'supermarkets', 'bodies', 'coming', 'back', 'dead', 'coming', 'back', 'comas', 'going', 'out', 'comas', 'least', 'seven', 'eight', 'characters', 'hospital', 'have', 'characters', 'falling', 'carparks', 'falling', 'windows', 'falling', 'off', 'ladders', 'falling', 'off', 'rooves', 'have', 'on-again-off-again', 'allegations', 'insanity', 'pedophilia', 'infidelity', 'spousal', 'homicide', 'utter', 'overdose', 'love', 'triangles', 'other', 'types', 'love', 'geometry', 'tracking', 'who', 'shagging', 'whom', 'so', 'hard', 'are', 'caused', 'doubt', 'very', 'foundation', 'space-time', 'continuum', 'love', 'itself.And', 'have', ""n't"", 'even', 'got', 'truly', 'exasperating', 'Susan', 'Myer', 'Perhaps', 'best', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'think', 'it.Olly', 'Buxton']",Desperate Housewives: Season 3
1069233,A1AST89AHN17O7,B000P6YNTI,Omnes,"[0, 1]","Two years after its pilot, Desperate Housewives started its third season. And what a great set of ideas Marc Cherry got in it. First of all, he brought in it a very good mystery, which involved not only one of my favorite characters, Orson Hodge, but the other Housewives, most of all Bree and Susan Mayer, now in a new romance with a British businessman called Ian. Which was great because although the second season's mystery was great, I felt it could have been perfect had the Housewives been more involved in its story, and not just Bree. But for This season, this mystery was well-paced, exciting, and set at a better rhythm than the other seasons. For the writers got the brilliant idea of ending their mystery at the fifteenth episode and not at the end of the finale. That way, Orson Hodge's mystery didn't drag on and on like in the fifth and sixth seasons. And the writers got to use the other episodes to prepare us for the fourth season, gave more space to Edie's storylines and even include a mystery with Karen Macklusky, which I really liked.Now for the episode Bang, I felt that this definitely was the best episode for it had lots of suspense and tension, but it also involved Lynette Scavo in one of her best scenes against Katherine Bigsby. This episode was such a success that Marc Cherry reused the concept of an accident in each season. Though I still think that only the tornado was up to par with the quality of the episode Bang. As for the fire and the plane crash, we'll talk about it in the next reviews.Finally, it was a great season because the Housewives interacted more between with each other, but of course in which we got to have other interesting guest characters, such Dixie Carter, who was perfect as Orson's mother, Lynn Redgrave, Laurie Metcalf, Matt Roth, Gwendoline Yeo, Jason Gedrick, and Rachel Fox.

There are many stories taking place, all focusing on the lives of the five desperate housewives: Suzanne, the clumsy one, who is always in search of drama; Lanett, the strongest character of them all, and the bossy mother of very naughty children; Gaby, the sexy Latina ex-model, who basically worships money and has no qualms dating teenagers; Idy, the promiscuous blond who is afraid to grow old alone; and finally Bree, the most unique character in the whole show; words would be hard to describe her.What I like about this TV series is that it grows on you. Unlike 90 and 120 minutes Hollywood movies, TV series allow you to really get to know the character. In some cases, you will even identify with many of them. The stories are original and not that farfetched. These are the stories of ordinary women in an ordinary suburb living on Wisteria Lane. Their lives are like many people we know (even Bree!). There is revenge, love, lust, sex, treachery, murder, ambition, power, jealousy, and of course gossip...you name it--basically, the ingredients of our everyday lives.Desperate Housewives is entertaining to watch. Try watching it from season one onwards to really understand the characters. I find it easier to buy the episodes and watch them one after the other than wait for them to come up on TV.Season 3 ends with some very interesting developments that will keep you in suspense until season 4 finally comes out on DVD. If you have not watched season 3 yet stop right here, because the following are spoilers.Idy falls for Carlos, but tricks him into believing that she stopped using birth control pills. Carlos dreams of having his own child, but when he finds the truth, he leaves Idy. In despair, she hangs herself. Did she die? We will have to wait for season 4!Gaby ends up marrying the mayor of the town, but finds out on her wedding day that she is being used by him. On her wedding day, she ends up having sex with Carlos (well, just French kissing really). Will they be back together in season 4?Suzanne marries Mike in a very unusual but romantic wedding (in the forest with only Mike, her daughter, and the priest present). Many will probably end-up married this way after watching this scene!Bree fakes her pregnancy in order to claim her teenage daughter's baby as her own.Lanett falls in love with her chef (cook), but nothing happens between them. But how will this change her marriage? She also finds out that she has lymphoma, and her mother moves in with them. What's worse, the lymphoma or your mother moving in with you?I can't wait for season 4!",5,A great show!,1201219200,"01 25, 2008",2008,2835,"['What', 'great', 'show', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'single', 'episode', 'other', 'TV', 'shows', 'where', 'feel', 'episodes', 'were', 'thrown', 'writers', 'run', 'ideas', 'episode', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'exciting', 'up', 'previous', 'episode', 'are', 'many', 'stories', 'taking', 'place', 'focusing', 'lives', 'five', 'desperate', 'housewives', 'Suzanne', 'clumsy', 'one', 'who', 'always', 'search', 'drama', 'Lanett', 'strongest', 'character', 'bossy', 'mother', 'very', 'naughty', 'children', 'Gaby', 'sexy', 'Latina', 'ex-model', 'who', 'basically', 'money', 'qualms', 'dating', 'teenagers', 'Idy', 'promiscuous', 'blond', 'who', 'afraid', 'grow', 'old', 'alone', 'finally', 'Bree', 'most', 'unique', 'character', 'whole', 'show', 'words', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'describe', 'her.What', 'like', 'TV', 'series', '90', '120', 'minutes', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'TV', 'series', 'really', 'get', 'know', 'character', 'cases', 'will', 'even', 'identify', 'many', 'stories', 'are', 'original', 'not', 'farfetched', 'are', 'stories', 'ordinary', 'women', 'ordinary', 'suburb', 'living', 'Wisteria', 'Lane', 'lives', 'are', 'many', 'people', 'know', 'even', 'Bree', 'revenge', 'love', 'lust', 'sex', 'treachery', 'murder', 'ambition', 'power', 'jealousy', 'course', 'gossip', 'name', 'basically', 'ingredients', 'everyday', 'lives.Desperate', 'Housewives', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'Try', 'watching', 'season', 'one', 'onwards', 'really', 'understand', 'characters', 'find', 'easier', 'buy', 'episodes', 'watch', 'one', 'other', 'wait', 'come', 'up', 'TV.Season', '3', 'ends', 'very', 'interesting', 'developments', 'will', 'keep', 'suspense', 'season', '4', 'finally', 'out', 'DVD', 'have', 'not', 'watched', 'season', '3', 'yet', 'stop', 'right', 'here', 'following', 'are', 'spoilers.Idy', 'falls', 'Carlos', 'believing', 'stopped', 'using', 'birth', 'control', 'pills', 'Carlos', 'dreams', 'having', 'own', 'child', 'when', 'truth', 'Idy', 'despair', 'Did', 'die', 'will', 'have', 'wait', 'season', '4', 'Gaby', 'up', 'marrying', 'mayor', 'town', 'out', 'wedding', 'day', 'being', 'used', 'wedding', 'day', 'up', 'having', 'sex', 'Carlos', 'well', 'just', 'French', 'kissing', 'really', 'Will', 'be', 'back', 'together', 'season', '4', 'Suzanne', 'marries', 'Mike', 'very', 'unusual', 'romantic', 'wedding', 'forest', 'only', 'Mike', 'daughter', 'priest', 'present', 'Many', 'will', 'probably', 'end-up', 'married', 'way', 'watching', 'scene', 'Bree', 'pregnancy', 'order', 'claim', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'baby', 'own.Lanett', 'love', 'chef', 'cook', 'nothing', 'happens', 'how', 'will', 'change', 'marriage', 'also', 'out', 'lymphoma', 'mother', 'moves', 'What', 'worse', 'lymphoma', 'mother', 'moving', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'season', '4']",Desperate Housewives: Season 3

1069238,A1TJJ7W8SF75D,B000P6YNTI,Timothy T. Ward,"[7, 10]","Season Two of Desperate Housewives wasn't all that bad, but it did suffer from a few noticeable mistakes-mainly the storyline with the Applewhites and how the writers made them suddenly disappear in the middle of the season(and subsequently killing off any remaining interest viewers once had with the story). The first episode of Season Three was fair but a forgiven fairness as it was an opener to tie up loose ends and see where the characters might go next. One factor that helped make Season Three so good was how it became as intriguing and as witty as remembered from the early days. The pace and flow had also returned. You wanted to tune in each week to see Susan deal with Mike's memory loss while dealing with Edie's manipulation at the same time, Bree having to contend with the lack of morality in her children as she also learned about Orson's past, and Lynette finding patience with Tom while finding tolerance as she dealt with the psycho from hell in the form of Nora. Some of the best episodes are from this season such as Episode #3 with ""A Weekend in the Country,"" and #6 in ""Sweetheart, I Have To Confess,"" an episode that was most entertaining and funny. The scenes with Lynette, Susan, and Gabby getting drunk while Bree was trying to win the attention of a former friend at an upscale country club were classic. Also included is the memorable ""Bang,""(episode#7). This episode was believeable and emotional right down to Lynette finding closure with the death of Mary Alice. Laurie Metcalf(Roseanne)was superb as the jilted wife who snapped. Next came Episide #8 with ""Children and Art,"" in which Lynette discovers a chilling secret about the new neighbor. The writers handled this story with brilliance and bravery for tackling a taboo topic on network television. Felicity Huffman gave a magnificent portrayl. Also first rate was Episode #10, ""Miracle Song,"" and with the first 10 episodes, Desperate Housewives was as bold as ever and was once again filled with the offbeat drama and dark comedy we know and love. The glaring mistake with this season was in Episode #13, ""Come Play Wiz Me."" This episode was awful and filled with ridiculous storylines. The plot involving Orson's ex-wife drugging him into the bed with the help of Gloria made me think the writers were wishing for a daytime television slot. Then we had the return of Zach-very pointless and off the mark. Also, it was an insult to viewers to make us think that Gabrielle would even consider a date with Zach under any circumstances. Lynette's decision to quit the firm was touching, but then the whole scene with her faking her pain in front of her boss just came off as plain stupid. Episodes #14 & #15 is where the mystery involving Orson's past and the murder of Monique is solved, and this conclusion was just as good and just as surprising as the mystery involving Paul and Mary Alice and a baby named Dana from the first season.",4,A Luster Restored,1184630400,"07 17, 2007",2007,2927,"['Season', 'Two', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'did', 'suffer', 'few', 'noticeable', 'mistakes-mainly', 'storyline', 'Applewhites', 'how', 'writers', 'made', 'suddenly', 'disappear', 'middle', 'season', 'subsequently', 'killing', 'off', 'remaining', 'interest', 'viewers', 'once', 'had', 'story', 'first', 'episode', 'Season', 'Three', 'was', 'fair', 'forgiven', 'fairness', 'was', 'opener', 'tie', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'see', 'where', 'characters', 'might', 'go', 'next', 'One', 'factor', 'helped', 'make', 'Season', 'Three', 'so', 'good', 'was', 'how', 'became', 'intriguing', 'as', 'witty', 'remembered', 'early', 'days', 'pace', 'flow', 'had', 'also', 'returned', 'wanted', 'tune', 'week', 'see', 'Susan', 'deal', 'Mike', 'memory', 'loss', 'dealing', 'Edie', 'manipulation', 'same', 'time', 'Bree', 'having', 'contend', 'lack', 'morality', 'children', 'also', 'learned', 'Orson', 'past', 'Lynette', 'finding', 'patience', 'Tom', 'finding', 'tolerance', 'psycho', 'hell', 'form', 'Nora', 'best', 'episodes', 'are', 'season', 'such', 'Episode', '3', 'A', 'Weekend', 'Country', '6', 'Sweetheart', 'Have', 'Confess', 'episode', 'was', 'most', 'entertaining', 'funny', 'scenes', 'Lynette', 'Susan', 'Gabby', 'getting', 'drunk', 'Bree', 'was', 'trying', 'win', 'attention', 'former', 'friend', 'upscale', 'country', 'club', 'were', 'classic', 'Also', 'included', 'memorable', 'Bang', 'episode', '7', 'episode', 'was', 'believeable', 'emotional', 'right', 'down', 'Lynette', 'finding', 'closure', 'death', 'Mary', 'Alice', 'Laurie', 'Metcalf', 'Roseanne', 'was', 'superb', 'jilted', 'wife', 'who', 'snapped', 'Next', 'came', 'Episide', '8', 'Children', 'Art', 'Lynette', 'chilling', 'secret', 'new', 'neighbor', 'writers', 'handled', 'story', 'brilliance', 'bravery', 'tackling', 'taboo', 'topic', 'network', 'television', 'Felicity', 'Huffman', 'gave', 'magnificent', 'portrayl', 'Also', 'first', 'rate', 'was', 'Episode', '10', 'Miracle', 'Song', 'first', '10', 'episodes', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'was', 'as', 'bold', 'ever', 'was', 'once', 'again', 'filled', 'offbeat', 'drama', 'dark', 'comedy', 'know', 'love', 'glaring', 'mistake', 'season', 'was', 'Episode', '13', 'Come', 'Play', 'Wiz', 'Me', 'episode', 'was', 'awful', 'filled', 'ridiculous', 'storylines', 'plot', 'involving', 'Orson', 'ex-wife', 'drugging', 'bed', 'help', 'Gloria', 'made', 'think', 'writers', 'were', 'wishing', 'daytime', 'television', 'slot', 'Then', 'had', 'return', 'Zach-very', 'pointless', 'mark', 'Also', 'was', 'insult', 'viewers', 'make', 'think', 'Gabrielle', 'would', 'even', 'consider', 'date', 'Zach', 'circumstances', 'Lynette', 'decision', 'quit', 'firm', 'was', 'touching', 'then', 'whole', 'scene', 'faking', 'pain', 'front', 'boss', 'just', 'came', 'off', 'plain', 'stupid', 'Episodes', '14', '15', 'where', 'mystery', 'involving', 'Orson', 'past', 'murder', 'Monique', 'solved', 'conclusion', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'just', 'as', 'surprising', 'mystery', 'involving', 'Paul', 'Mary', 'Alice', 'baby', 'named', 'Dana', 'first', 'season']",Desperate Housewives: Season 3
1069239,A2GOT71TLMZ5I5,B000P6YNTI,Victor Capo,"[2, 2]","***DON'T WORRY--SPOILER-FREE REVIEW***When I first heard of Desperate Housewives, I wasn't interested. Coming off the heels of Sex and the City's series finale, I thought it was destined to be a cheesey, watered down ""replacement"" for HBO's iconic show. However, after seeing the very first episode, I realized I was wrong. Desperate Housewives is entirely in a class of its own, and distinguishes itself with its unique blend of dark comedy, mystery, and suspense. After the first episode, I was hooked, and have been ever since.In my opinion, the first season of the show was perfect. Great story, characters, writing, and performances by everyone involved. While many viewers and critics found Season 2 bizarre and irrelevant, I feel it may have been overly-scrutinized and simply didn't live up to the hype that Season 1's overwhelming success had stirred. Yes, some of the sub-plots were uninteresting, and the main arching storyline involving the Applewhites wasn't as intriguing as Season 1's story, but it was still an incredibly fun season to watch.While Season 2 took on a much darker tone (maybe too dark for the characters involved), Season 3 managed to find the perfect balance of comedy and suspense--a formula that made Season 1 so successful. In fact, Season 3 is probably the funniest season yet! By now, the characters are so well-defined, that the actors and writers have more freedom to take them to some very funny extremes, without having to explain everything along the way.As funny as it is, Season 3 also weaves a great arching mystery and a number of juicy stories for every character throughout the season, consistently keeping viewers coming back to find out just what will happen next.Highlight episodes of Season 3 include the season premiere (""Listen to the Rain on the Roof""), the INCREDIBLE, FANTASTIC, AMAZING ""Bang,"" ""The Miracle Song,"" ""I Remember That,"" ""The Little Things You Do Together,"" ""God, That's Good,"" ""Into the Woods,"" ""What Would We Do Without You?"" and the shocking season finale, ""Getting Married Today.""The DVD set is great, but a few more extras like commentaries and maybe some past season promos would have been nice.Overall, this was an excellent season for the residents of Wisteria Lane! I can't wait to see what Season 4 has in store for them!",5,Another Excellent Season of the Best Show on Television!,1189468800,"09 11, 2007",2007,2301,"['***DO', ""N'T"", 'WORRY', 'SPOILER-FREE', 'REVIEW***When', 'first', 'heard', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'was', ""n't"", 'interested', 'Coming', 'off', 'heels', 'Sex', 'City', 'series', 'finale', 'thought', 'was', 'destined', 'be', 'cheesey', 'watered', 'replacement', 'HBO', 'iconic', 'show', 'However', 'seeing', 'very', 'first', 'episode', 'realized', 'was', 'wrong', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'entirely', 'class', 'own', 'unique', 'blend', 'dark', 'comedy', 'mystery', 'suspense', 'first', 'episode', 'was', 'hooked', 'have', 'been', 'ever', 'since.In', 'opinion', 'first', 'season', 'show', 'was', 'perfect', 'Great', 'story', 'characters', 'writing', 'performances', 'everyone', 'involved', 'many', 'viewers', 'critics', 'found', 'Season', '2', 'bizarre', 'irrelevant', 'feel', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'overly-scrutinized', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'hype', 'Season', '1', 'overwhelming', 'success', 'had', 'stirred', 'Yes', 'sub-plots', 'were', 'uninteresting', 'main', 'arching', 'storyline', 'involving', 'Applewhites', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'intriguing', 'Season', '1', 'story', 'was', 'still', 'incredibly', 'fun', 'season', 'watch.While', 'Season', '2', 'took', 'much', 'darker', 'tone', 'maybe', 'too', 'dark', 'characters', 'involved', 'Season', '3', 'managed', 'find', 'perfect', 'balance', 'comedy', 'suspense', 'formula', 'made', 'Season', '1', 'so', 'successful', 'fact', 'Season', '3', 'probably', 'funniest', 'season', 'yet', 'now', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'well-defined', 'actors', 'writers', 'have', 'more', 'freedom', 'take', 'very', 'funny', 'extremes', 'having', 'explain', 'everything', 'way.As', 'funny', 'Season', '3', 'also', 'great', 'arching', 'mystery', 'number', 'juicy', 'stories', 'character', 'season', 'consistently', 'keeping', 'viewers', 'coming', 'back', 'find', 'out', 'just', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next.Highlight', 'episodes', 'Season', '3', 'include', 'season', 'premiere', 'Listen', 'Rain', 'Roof', 'INCREDIBLE', 'FANTASTIC', 'AMAZING', 'Bang', 'Miracle', 'Song', 'Remember', 'Little', 'Things', 'Do', 'Together', 'God', 'That', 'Good', 'Into', 'Woods', 'What', 'Would', 'Do', 'shocking', 'season', 'finale', 'Getting', 'Married', 'Today', 'DVD', 'set', 'great', 'few', 'more', 'extras', 'commentaries', 'maybe', 'past', 'season', 'promos', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice.Overall', 'was', 'excellent', 'season', 'residents', 'Wisteria', 'Lane', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'Season', '4', 'store']",Desperate Housewives: Season 3
