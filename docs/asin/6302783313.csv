333536,A2SLA0SXRQV8M0,6302783313,Andres C. Salama,"[6, 13]","In 1950s Sweden, two young working class kids, still in their teens, the reckless and rebellious Monica and the handsome if quiet Harry, decide to elope from their families in his father's boat and have a torrid affair in an island in the Stockholm archipelago during the summer. When she becomes pregnant, the couple has to return to the city and face reality. Harry gets a stable job and strives to become a responsible parent, but Monica rejects the routine of married life, and eventually the responsibilities of motherhood, because, as she says, being young she prefers to have fun. This film was reputedly extremely daring at the time it was filmed (Monica appears in a few scenes partially nude at the beach) but it really seems almost quaint now. One problem is that films dealing with social issues tend to age quickly, much more so than other type of films. Since social mores change, a film portraying a conflict with the social norms of the era that seems daring at the time it is released looks more and more dated once the social norms are changed. The beginning, portraying Monica fighting with her coarse working class family in their crowded apartment and at their grocer's post, seems to belong to a socialist realism movie. Maybe director Ingmar Bergman was at that point too influenced by the Italian films of the time, but it doesn't look a Swedish milieu at all. Harry is portrayed as the more mature of the two, but at times he is also totally irresponsible, like when he decides to elope with Monica at the moment when his father is gravely ill at the hospital (and what happened to him is never said, apparently he died while the couple were at the island). It is said that Monica became an inspiration to many rebellious girls in the 1950s and 1960s, but I found her character unappealing all way through, not terribly physically attractive and also irresponsible, immature, callous, capricious. And there are some really inept scenes in the movie (yes, I know the scenes were directed by Bergman, but I still would called them ineptly filmed) like when he fights the other guy in the beach or when Monica steals a roasted meat to a middle class family. The movie has a great scene though, that seems to belong to a better and more recent movie, when Monica, after she becomes a mother and is dissatisfied with conjugal life with Harry, flirts in a bar with a new lover and suddenly breaks the fourth wall looking straight at the camera with a seducing look. So this is not a great movie in my view, though at least it gives some material for thought.",3,"Somewhat dated Bergman, but still worth watching",1294358400,"01 7, 2011",2011,2577,"['1950s', 'Sweden', 'two', 'young', 'working', 'class', 'kids', 'still', 'teens', 'reckless', 'rebellious', 'Monica', 'handsome', 'quiet', 'Harry', 'decide', 'elope', 'families', 'father', 'boat', 'have', 'torrid', 'affair', 'island', 'Stockholm', 'archipelago', 'summer', 'When', 'pregnant', 'couple', 'return', 'city', 'face', 'reality', 'Harry', 'stable', 'job', 'become', 'responsible', 'parent', 'Monica', 'routine', 'married', 'life', 'eventually', 'responsibilities', 'motherhood', 'because', 'being', 'young', 'have', 'fun', 'film', 'was', 'reputedly', 'extremely', 'daring', 'time', 'was', 'filmed', 'Monica', 'few', 'scenes', 'partially', 'nude', 'beach', 'really', 'almost', 'quaint', 'now', 'One', 'problem', 'films', 'dealing', 'social', 'issues', 'tend', 'age', 'quickly', 'much', 'more', 'so', 'other', 'type', 'films', 'social', 'mores', 'change', 'film', 'portraying', 'conflict', 'social', 'norms', 'era', 'daring', 'time', 'released', 'looks', 'more', 'more', 'dated', 'once', 'social', 'norms', 'are', 'changed', 'beginning', 'portraying', 'Monica', 'fighting', 'coarse', 'working', 'class', 'family', 'crowded', 'apartment', 'grocer', 'post', 'belong', 'socialist', 'realism', 'movie', 'Maybe', 'director', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'was', 'point', 'too', 'influenced', 'Italian', 'films', 'time', ""n't"", 'look', 'Swedish', 'milieu', 'Harry', 'portrayed', 'more', 'mature', 'two', 'times', 'also', 'totally', 'irresponsible', 'when', 'elope', 'Monica', 'moment', 'when', 'father', 'gravely', 'ill', 'hospital', 'what', 'happened', 'never', 'said', 'apparently', 'died', 'couple', 'were', 'island', 'said', 'Monica', 'became', 'inspiration', 'many', 'rebellious', 'girls', '1950s', '1960s', 'found', 'character', 'unappealing', 'way', 'not', 'terribly', 'physically', 'attractive', 'also', 'irresponsible', 'immature', 'callous', 'capricious', 'are', 'really', 'inept', 'scenes', 'movie', 'yes', 'know', 'scenes', 'were', 'directed', 'Bergman', 'still', 'would', 'called', 'ineptly', 'filmed', 'when', 'other', 'guy', 'beach', 'when', 'Monica', 'roasted', 'meat', 'middle', 'class', 'family', 'movie', 'great', 'scene', 'belong', 'better', 'more', 'recent', 'movie', 'when', 'Monica', 'mother', 'dissatisfied', 'conjugal', 'life', 'Harry', 'bar', 'new', 'lover', 'suddenly', 'fourth', 'wall', 'looking', 'straight', 'camera', 'seducing', 'look', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'view', 'though', 'least', 'material', 'thought']",N/A

333538,A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,6302783313,"Christopher Barrett ""Evil Corgi""","[1, 1]","Many do consider this the first major film of Bergman, but I feel that Sommerlek (Summer Interlude) would technically qualify as his first breakthrough.  Though in this film I saw shades of the French New Wave, little touches that reminded me of Truffaut and even early Goddard (at least with the cinematography and sparse dialogue at times).And speaking of cinematography, this is one of the earlier collaborations with Gunnar Fischer, who would continue collaborating with Bergman on such marvelous eye candy as Seventh Seal, Wild Strawberries, and up to The Magician before being replaced with Sven Nyquist.  I actually preferred Fischer's cinematography over Nyquists.  While the later films (such as Persona) were arguably 'better' in an artistic sense, I really felt that Fischer had an amazing grasp of black and white with less emphasis on shades of gray (sorry about putting that in there - no reference to the book).  A lot of the scenery in this film, and other Fischer films is the dramatic use of deep black and light grays to create an almost surrealistic effect.  Done so marvelously in this film.Criterion has really outdone themselves with this new release (the restoration that is).  I have the DVD from the library, so I cannot comment on the Blu-Ray, but the DVD is just pristine and clear.  The sound is retained with the original mono track.  Dust and particles have been cleaned, but the image was not run through a 'wash' filter.  The clarity is there.  Contrast is impeccable.My one beef is that there are limited special features.  I'm not so driven to a frenzy by the lack of special features, just at nearly $30, I expect something a little more.  Remember when Criterion used to have gobs of special features? Three disc Seven Samurai set ring a bell?  Well the booklets are getting thinner, and the content in the booklets is rather short.  This is the main reason for the four star review as opposed to five.  Plus, this film is clearly a transitional film and cannot hold a candle to Seventh Seal, Wild Strawberries, or even Smiles of a Summer Night.  So four stars it is.Oh, and the film is about a young dalliance that turns all too real.  It reminds one of Summer Interlude, yet it does beyond what happened in Summer Interlude (in that film we had an incident which prevented their being together in the long run).  In this we see the reality of the romance, and what happens after the fire goes out.  Harriet Andersson rules the screen in this early film of hers.A MUST see for Bergman fans, though it is not among his best 5.  Perhaps squeaks into a top 10 list of his films.  But it's important to show where he was coming from (Summer Interlude) and where he was about to lead us.  Nearly $30 to purchase this film on DVD when Summer Interlude (released just a few months ago) is $15 and has about the same content and extras?  Not understanding the current pricing setup from Criterion.  If this film drops under $20, then it is worth purchasing.",4,The 'second' important Bergman film ~,1345593600,"08 22, 2012",2012,2987,"['Many', 'do', 'consider', 'first', 'major', 'film', 'Bergman', 'feel', 'Sommerlek', 'Summer', 'Interlude', 'would', 'technically', 'qualify', 'first', 'breakthrough', 'film', 'saw', 'shades', 'French', 'New', 'Wave', 'little', 'touches', 'reminded', 'Truffaut', 'even', 'early', 'Goddard', 'least', 'cinematography', 'sparse', 'dialogue', 'times', '.And', 'speaking', 'cinematography', 'one', 'earlier', 'collaborations', 'Gunnar', 'Fischer', 'who', 'would', 'continue', 'collaborating', 'Bergman', 'such', 'marvelous', 'eye', 'candy', 'Seventh', 'Seal', 'Wild', 'Strawberries', 'up', 'Magician', 'being', 'replaced', 'Sven', 'Nyquist', 'actually', 'preferred', 'Fischer', 'cinematography', 'Nyquists', 'later', 'films', 'such', 'Persona', 'were', 'arguably', ""'better"", 'artistic', 'sense', 'really', 'felt', 'Fischer', 'had', 'amazing', 'grasp', 'black', 'white', 'less', 'emphasis', 'shades', 'gray', 'sorry', 'putting', 'reference', 'book', 'lot', 'scenery', 'film', 'other', 'Fischer', 'films', 'dramatic', 'use', 'deep', 'black', 'light', 'grays', 'create', 'almost', 'surrealistic', 'effect', 'Done', 'so', 'marvelously', 'film.Criterion', 'really', 'outdone', 'new', 'release', 'restoration', 'have', 'DVD', 'library', 'can', 'not', 'comment', 'Blu-Ray', 'DVD', 'just', 'pristine', 'clear', 'sound', 'retained', 'original', 'mono', 'track', 'Dust', 'particles', 'have', 'been', 'cleaned', 'image', 'was', 'not', 'run', ""'wash"", 'filter', 'clarity', 'there', 'Contrast', 'impeccable.My', 'one', 'beef', 'are', 'limited', 'special', 'features', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'driven', 'frenzy', 'lack', 'special', 'features', 'just', 'nearly', '30', 'expect', 'something', 'little', 'more', 'Remember', 'when', 'Criterion', 'used', 'have', 'gobs', 'special', 'features', 'Three', 'disc', 'Seven', 'Samurai', 'set', 'ring', 'bell', 'Well', 'booklets', 'are', 'getting', 'thinner', 'content', 'booklets', 'rather', 'short', 'main', 'reason', 'four', 'star', 'review', 'opposed', 'five', 'film', 'clearly', 'transitional', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'hold', 'candle', 'Seventh', 'Seal', 'Wild', 'Strawberries', 'even', 'Smiles', 'Summer', 'Night', 'So', 'four', 'stars', 'film', 'young', 'dalliance', 'too', 'real', 'one', 'Summer', 'Interlude', 'yet', 'what', 'happened', 'Summer', 'Interlude', 'film', 'had', 'incident', 'prevented', 'being', 'together', 'long', 'run', 'see', 'reality', 'romance', 'what', 'fire', 'out', 'Harriet', 'Andersson', 'rules', 'screen', 'early', 'film', 'hers.A', 'MUST', 'see', 'Bergman', 'fans', 'not', 'best', '5', 'Perhaps', 'top', '10', 'list', 'films', 'important', 'show', 'where', 'was', 'coming', 'Summer', 'Interlude', 'where', 'was', 'about', 'lead', 'Nearly', '30', 'purchase', 'film', 'DVD', 'when', 'Summer', 'Interlude', 'released', 'just', 'few', 'months', 'ago', '15', 'same', 'content', 'extras', 'Not', 'understanding', 'current', 'pricing', 'setup', 'Criterion', 'film', '20', 'then', 'worth', 'purchasing']",N/A

Before the demise of the big screen, the distilling influence of t.v., the necessity for big budgets -  the mandatory interference with the art by folks who really do not belong in the creative process - casting directors, tyrannical studio v.p.'s, credit-jumpers, tabloid paparazzi, the right wing politicizing of lew wasserman and the hollywood blacklisters - particularly in small countries like Sweeden and Japan - one could still create art on the screen in a simple, unvarnished, moving way.  Like Kurusawa's magnificent Ikiru filmed around the same time, Summer With Monika is simply one of Bergman's best, and upon many years of reflection, more memorable for me than Persona, Skammen, or other more highly touted, more complex Bergman masterpieces.Though not without idiosyncracies and flaws, the film maybe Bergman's definitive investigation of a question that haunts many of his later undertakings - what is at the root of (god forbid me for saying it) the feminine mystique?

333542,A280GY5UVUS2QH,6302783313,Doug Anderson,"[1, 1]","Thematically, My Summer with Monika is very simple. Its the story of a young shopgirl (Harriet Anderson) who begins dating a young worker and would-be student Harry. Monika is extremely comfortable in her body and extremely forward with men. She's a natural flirt and she's the one who makes the first move with the much more subdued Harry at a local cafe. What they share is discontent with their workaday existence. From the opening scenes we can see that Monika is spilling over with life (and raw sensuality and desire) and that she is someone who knows that she must go after what she wants, not wait for it, but what does she want? Like many young shopgirls, she knows she doesn't want to be a shopgirl, but she has no other plan, no other options, or opportunities. She can attract men easily, but she doesn't know what to to do with them once she's got them. Harry is slightly better looking and from a slightly better social class than her other boyfriends and he's also slightly more naive. Its never clear whether she really loves Harry or if Harry with his boat offers her an escape from a life she can no longer tolerate. Monika seems fairly transparent and yet there is ambiguity in her character that makes this film transcend the usual girl-traps-rich-boy-into-marrying-her-story (which this both is and isn't). What is clear about Monika is that with her feline sexuality she can persuade Harry to do whatever she wants him to do. That both intrigues her (and allows her to take ameasure of her own power) and bores her (Harry rarely initiates any of their adventures). The summer they spend running away from the world is both a study in youthful escapism and bonding and also an awakening to adult isolation and disappointment. At the beginning of the film, Monika moves like a cat who can find no prey to satisfy her. At the end of the film she knows it.The New Wave directors love the moment, near the end, when  adjusts her hair and then looks directly into the camera. Its a fascinating look/a look that comes from somewhere deep inside: she seems to be daring us to look as squarley at her (and what she represents/has to tell us) as she is looking at us. Its up to the individual viewer to accept this invitiation or to reject it.In the DVD extras we learn that the main selling point for this and other Swedish films (that contained brief nudity) was their open sensuality. And that sensuality is still striking but in the moment Monika stares directly at us she becomes something far more than an object of desire, she becomes a symbol of youthful disaffection.",5,Swedish Summer and Hints of the New Wave to Come,1342828800,"07 21, 2012",2012,2588,"['Thematically', 'Summer', 'Monika', 'very', 'simple', 'story', 'young', 'shopgirl', 'Harriet', 'Anderson', 'who', 'dating', 'young', 'worker', 'would-be', 'student', 'Harry', 'Monika', 'extremely', 'comfortable', 'body', 'extremely', 'forward', 'men', 'natural', 'flirt', 'one', 'who', 'first', 'move', 'much', 'more', 'subdued', 'Harry', 'local', 'cafe', 'What', 'share', 'discontent', 'workaday', 'existence', 'opening', 'can', 'see', 'Monika', 'spilling', 'life', 'raw', 'sensuality', 'desire', 'someone', 'who', 'must', 'go', 'what', 'not', 'wait', 'what', 'want', 'many', 'young', 'shopgirls', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'shopgirl', 'other', 'plan', 'other', 'options', 'opportunities', 'can', 'attract', 'men', 'easily', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'once', 'got', 'Harry', 'slightly', 'better', 'looking', 'slightly', 'better', 'social', 'class', 'other', 'boyfriends', 'also', 'slightly', 'more', 'naive', 'never', 'clear', 'really', 'Harry', 'Harry', 'boat', 'escape', 'life', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'tolerate', 'Monika', 'fairly', 'transparent', 'yet', 'ambiguity', 'character', 'film', 'transcend', 'usual', 'girl-traps-rich-boy-into-marrying-her-story', ""n't"", 'What', 'clear', 'Monika', 'feline', 'sexuality', 'can', 'persuade', 'Harry', 'do', 'do', 'intrigues', 'take', 'ameasure', 'own', 'power', 'Harry', 'rarely', 'adventures', 'summer', 'spend', 'running', 'away', 'world', 'study', 'youthful', 'escapism', 'bonding', 'also', 'awakening', 'adult', 'isolation', 'disappointment', 'beginning', 'film', 'Monika', 'cat', 'who', 'can', 'find', 'prey', 'satisfy', 'end', 'film', 'it.The', 'New', 'Wave', 'directors', 'love', 'moment', 'end', 'when', 'hair', 'then', 'directly', 'camera', 'fascinating', 'look/a', 'look', 'somewhere', 'deep', 'inside', 'be', 'daring', 'look', 'squarley', 'what', 'represents/has', 'tell', 'looking', 'individual', 'viewer', 'accept', 'invitiation', 'reject', 'it.In', 'DVD', 'extras', 'learn', 'main', 'selling', 'point', 'other', 'Swedish', 'films', 'contained', 'brief', 'nudity', 'was', 'open', 'sensuality', 'sensuality', 'still', 'striking', 'moment', 'Monika', 'directly', 'something', 'far', 'more', 'object', 'desire', 'symbol', 'youthful', 'disaffection']",N/A

Would they be able to love each other after the reality of marriage would fight with their eternal love, when the baby is crying all night long and there is no money to pay a rent, and young and tender Juliet has learned about power and pleasures of sex but her Romeo is always out working, trying to make enough money to support her and the child?

Summer with Monika is a Criterion release, so you know that it looks as good as it can. For a 60-year-old film, the results are most pleasing.The story is about human relationships, and how our perspectives alter as we mature. Harry is 19 when he's approached by Monika in a cafe. She's very forward and asks him if he'll take her to the cinema. After he agrees, the two decide that they need to be together. The title suggests that the relationship might not last forever, but stop reading now if you want to avoid further spoilers.Both have boring jobs, and Harry soon follows Monika's lead after she quits. She seeks refuge with him, claiming that her drunken father is abusive, and Harry does his best to provide for her. In order to have privacy, he takes her to his father's boat and they sleep there. This is the start of an adventure in the style of a road movie, but this one involves a boat. The two sail to secluded areas and live with a certain amount of freedom. The main problem is their lack of money, but they are not above stealing in order to survive. It's like an ancient cross between Something Wild, Pierrot le fou, and Grave of the Fireflies, but nobody's life is in danger.Things follow their natural course, with Monika eventually revealing that she is pregnant. It's here that Harry realizes that his idyllic life will soon have to end, and that the couple will need to be more responsible if they are to raise a child, but Monika hates the thought of returning to her old life. When she accepts the inevitable, their lives change. Harry's life starts to feel like Henry Spencer's existence in Eraserhead, as he is forced to find time to study, work, support his family, and take care of his baby. Monika doesn't seem ready to be a mother at all and wants her life to go back to the way it was.One interesting sequence shows the differing outlooks of teenagers and middle-aged people. The younger couple feel that they have to rebel and escape a traditional life in order to be happy, but one of the older characters embraces the feel of the city after being away for a few days.Bergman uses the industrial smoke and natural mist to enhance the dreamlike quality of their romance, and reinforces it by having his two characters smoke cigarettes throughout the film. This is a fairly straightforward look at young romance, and shows how society viewed people who had children before they were married. If you want to see how Stockholm looked in the 50s, this is like an historical document.Summer with Monika won't drastically alter your perspective on life, but it's a well-told romance with plenty of realism.

C.,"[1, 1]","Bergman is perhaps one of those artists that you either love or perhaps quite like; maybe some people hate his films.'Summer with Monika' is I think one of his most accessible films, and in actual fact is a little like 'Summer Interlude' in it's story. The difference is that where the latter is a nostalgic journey into a bittersweet past, the former film is about a reckless, feckless summer fling in the present tense. Two basically working class kids decide to pack in their jobs and take a summer vacation on dad's boat going to explore the lonely coast of Sweden. It sounds idyllic, and while they are on holiday it is; kind of. The cinematography and scenes in this film are wonderful, and when the boat leaves the city and reaches the great outdoors, you can say that Sweden is a beautiful country.Anyway, the summer spent with Monika is wonderful, even though they run out of money and there is a fist fight after some delinquent sets fire to the boat; who said Bergman was all cerebral?! Unfortunately, poor Monika gets knocked up, although she seems quite cool with it. When they finally return, from cloud 9, to stark reality again, the truth perhaps dawns on them both; they had better try and make a go of it. The poor kids tie the knot, but things just don't work out; Harry tries to get more education so he can get decent employment but Monika is bored looking after the baby and staying in all the time. They part, as Monika starts going with other men and out to nightclubs, and poor Harry is left carrying the baby. Not so bleak, but not so happy either.Bergman was an artist and he tried to convey great truths (I think) through simple, and sometimes complex, human relationships of all kinds. That he largely succeeded is testimony to the fact that he remains a much cherished filmmaker to this day, and of course his films are no doubt watched and admired all over the world. Is it possible to really know what Bergman was trying to say in this film? Perhaps, and perhaps not. Is it a poem to lost youth and lost ideals; the myth of 'happy ever after' meeting the harsh reality of life, and how adults complicate matters by being sophisticated and worldly, whereas the two kids who go on that boat jaunt are innocent and carefree, even if Monika is a troubled soul. Perhaps 'Summer with Monika' is Bergmans paean to lost youth and the sad fact we all grow up, and perhaps far too quickly.",5,Another thoughtful film from Bergman,1370390400,"06 5, 2013",2013,2411,"['Bergman', 'perhaps', 'one', 'artists', 'either', 'love', 'perhaps', 'quite', 'maybe', 'people', 'hate', 'films', 'Monika', 'think', 'one', 'most', 'accessible', 'films', 'actual', 'fact', 'little', 'Interlude', 'story', 'difference', 'where', 'latter', 'nostalgic', 'journey', 'bittersweet', 'past', 'former', 'film', 'reckless', 'feckless', 'summer', 'fling', 'present', 'tense', 'Two', 'basically', 'working', 'class', 'kids', 'decide', 'pack', 'jobs', 'take', 'summer', 'vacation', 'dad', 'boat', 'going', 'explore', 'lonely', 'coast', 'Sweden', 'idyllic', 'are', 'holiday', 'kind', 'cinematography', 'scenes', 'film', 'are', 'wonderful', 'when', 'boat', 'city', 'great', 'outdoors', 'can', 'say', 'Sweden', 'beautiful', 'country.Anyway', 'summer', 'spent', 'Monika', 'wonderful', 'even', 'run', 'money', 'fist', 'fight', 'delinquent', 'sets', 'fire', 'boat', 'who', 'said', 'Bergman', 'was', 'cerebral', 'Unfortunately', 'poor', 'Monika', 'knocked', 'up', 'quite', 'cool', 'When', 'finally', 'return', 'cloud', '9', 'stark', 'reality', 'again', 'truth', 'perhaps', 'dawns', 'had', 'better', 'try', 'make', 'go', 'poor', 'kids', 'tie', 'knot', 'things', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'Harry', 'get', 'more', 'education', 'can', 'get', 'decent', 'employment', 'Monika', 'bored', 'looking', 'baby', 'staying', 'time', 'part', 'Monika', 'going', 'other', 'men', 'nightclubs', 'poor', 'Harry', 'left', 'carrying', 'baby', 'Not', 'so', 'bleak', 'not', 'so', 'happy', 'either.Bergman', 'was', 'artist', 'tried', 'convey', 'great', 'truths', 'think', 'simple', 'sometimes', 'complex', 'human', 'relationships', 'kinds', 'largely', 'succeeded', 'testimony', 'fact', 'much', 'cherished', 'filmmaker', 'day', 'course', 'films', 'are', 'doubt', 'watched', 'admired', 'world', 'possible', 'really', 'know', 'what', 'Bergman', 'was', 'trying', 'say', 'film', 'Perhaps', 'perhaps', 'not', 'poem', 'lost', 'youth', 'lost', 'ideals', 'myth', ""'happy"", 'ever', 'meeting', 'harsh', 'reality', 'life', 'how', 'adults', 'complicate', 'matters', 'being', 'sophisticated', 'worldly', 'two', 'kids', 'who', 'go', 'boat', 'jaunt', 'are', 'innocent', 'carefree', 'even', 'Monika', 'troubled', 'soul', 'Perhaps', 'Monika', 'Bergmans', 'paean', 'lost', 'youth', 'sad', 'fact', 'grow', 'up', 'perhaps', 'far', 'too', 'quickly']",N/A
333554,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,6302783313,Turfseer,"[8, 8]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Rating: 4.5 out of 5.0Right before the release of 'Sawdust and Tinsel', which marked the beginning of Ingmar Bergman's long string of profound films with metaphysical themes, he served up 'Summer with Monika', a film more in the tradition of the Italian neo-realists, about a young couple who spend a summer of abandon amongst the islands of the Swedish archipelago, north of Stockholm, before returning to the city and getting married.The film's principals, Harry and Monika, are introduced when they meet at a bar. One is struck right away by Monika's liking for Harry--he really doesn't have to do anything and immediately scores a date with her at the local cinema. We soon discover that both young people are very needy. Monika comes from the more lower class background, residing in a tenement apartment with her mother and an alcoholic father, along with younger siblings who can't keep quiet. Harry lives in a bigger home but lost his mother when he was eight and hardly speaks with his father who suffers from health problems.In the film's first act, Harry and Monika are at the point where they both want to run away as they both hate their jobs. Harry is a delivery person for a glass and porcelain factory and is constantly berated by his superiors as he's often late for work and shows little enthusiasm for the job. Monika works for a produce wholesaler and must endure the salacious comments and outright groping by crass co-workers and supervisors. It's understandable how Monika is so immediately attracted to the kindly Harry, as he doesn't treat her as a sex object like many of the men she knows from her side of the tracks.Perhaps the only unsatisfying aspect of 'Summer with Monika', is the underdeveloped character of Lelle, one of Monika's neighbors who we can presume has either had a prior relationship with Monika or admired her from afar. Out of jealousy he socks Harry in the face out of the blue, after observing him escorting Monika home and saying goodbye. It's an awkward scene because we find out nothing about Lelle before, and wonder simply who this guy is.The film's second act (where the principals commit themselves to an adventure outside their ordinary lives) occurs after Harry is fired from his job (and Monika quits hers); Harry ends up convincing Monika to take his father's motor boat up to the islands in the archipelago and 'live free' from the constraints of their drab lives back in the city. The cinematography, highlighting the natural wonders of this part of Sweden, is magnificent. The second act machinations include more revelations about Harry's upbringing as well as another awkward scene with Lelle fighting Harry after he attempts to torch their boat (has he been stalking the couple the whole time? Again, he's a character who always seems to be popping up out of the blue without a back story).One of the great things about Bergman is that you can always count on him for his deeply nuanced female characters. 'Summer with Monika' is basically a brilliant character study about a very young woman who turns out to be quite different than what we're first led to believe. At first, Monika appears quite sympathetic, as she cradles Harry in her arms after he reveals how lonely he was as a child (due to the loss of his mother and distant father).Even before Monika's sudden transformation, there are clues that she has quite a different temperament than Harry. When Harry is fired, he only brings himself to tip over one glass in the factory, instead of smashing many more glasses as he could have done. When Harry knocks Lelle down during the boating trip, Harry restrains Monika, who could have ended up killing him, by striking him with the oar.Monika begins to sing a different tune when the intrepid couple find themselves subsisting on mushrooms for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Like a savage animal, she breaks into a well-to-do home on one of the islands and steals a pot roast. The husband calls the police but Monika breaks free and returns to the boat, where Harry chastises her for committing an illegal (and hence immoral) act. Monika has no scruples, and believes that the 'ends justify the means'.The third act, perhaps the strongest of the film, chronicles the dissolution of Harry and Monika's relationship. They end up marrying due to Monika's pregnancy. She turns out to be the wife from hell as she doesn't want to care for her child and would like to resume the life she had when she was single. Meanwhile, Harry takes steps toward maturity by finding a job, with co-workers who treat him with respect.Things go from bad to worse, when Harry discovers that she's been sleeping with Lelle and also spent the rent money on an expensive suit. When he asks her why she went to bed with Lelle, she cynically claims that she loves him. Harry then slaps Monika who ends up leaving him. Bergman's portrait of Monika is sympathetic but he doesn't excuse her behavior. In effect, she goes back to the very men she was trying to escape from in the first place. The famous close-up of Monika suggests that she's as empty on the inside as that vacant stare we see on the outside.On the other hand, when we see Harry close-up in the last scene, we're first treated to a montage of the young father's memories of his summer with Monika. His expression changes from pride in his newborn, to a look of sadness, as he realizes that he has a tough road ahead as a single parent. The brilliance of Bergman is that he never sugarcoats reality. Monika's actions are vile but her difficult upbringing is no excuse for her rejecting her responsibilities as a mother. Indeed, Bergman is saying, there are people like Monika in this world! Deal with it!",4,Superb portrait of a young woman who isn't who she appears to be,1344988800,"08 15, 2012",2012,5749,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***Rating', '4.5', '5.0Right',

Harry steals his father's boat and the two spend the summer frolicking upon various islands.  At first, the young lovers enjoy living and loving in the wild and eating mushrooms in the woods.  As the summer comes to a close, however, the idyllic spell is broken.  Monika finds herself pregnant and, in time, gives birth to a baby.  Harry is content to settle down with Monika and their child, but she soon becomes bored with domestic life.  In the end Monika leaves Harry and their child.  The next thing you know she is hanging out in bars, enticing men in her slinky dress.Harriet Anderson, the actress who plays Monika, has a fresh-faced beauty that you seldom see in movies, some of which can be ascribed to her not wearing makeup.  She was a lover of director Ingmar Bergman, who developed this movie as a vehicle for her.  It is also my understanding that this movie is considered to have played a pioneering role in the use of nudity and sexuality in film.",5,A bittersweet romance,1341878400,"07 10, 2012",2012,1090,"['tale', 'summer', 'romance', 'Harry', 'Monika', 'two', 'working', 'class', 'youths', 'late', 'tens', 'early', 'twenties', 'Harry', 'father', 'boat', 'two', 'spend', 'summer', 'frolicking', 'various', 'islands', 'first', 'young', 'lovers', 'enjoy', 'living', 'loving', 'wild', 'eating', 'mushrooms', 'woods', 'summer', 'close', 'however', 'idyllic', 'spell', 'broken', 'Monika', 'pregnant', 'time', 'birth', 'baby', 'Harry', 'content', 'settle', 'down', 'Monika', 'child', 'soon', 'becomes', 'bored', 'domestic', 'life', 'end', 'Monika', 'Harry', 'child', 'next', 'thing', 'know', 'hanging', 'out', 'bars', 'enticing', 'men', 'slinky', 'dress.Harriet', 'Anderson', 'actress', 'who', 'Monika', 'fresh-faced', 'beauty', 'seldom', 'see', 'movies', 'can', 'be', 'ascribed', 'not', 'wearing', 'makeup', 'was', 'lover', 'director', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'who', 'developed', 'movie', 'vehicle', 'also', 'understanding', 'movie', 'considered', 'have', 'played', 'pioneering', 'role', 'use', 'nudity', 'sexuality', 'film']",N/A

Films which set the benchmark and inspired no doubt thousands of budding directors. This is one of his works that I just never got around to watching. I really don't know how it escaped me. It is famous in its own right for inspiring what any Baby Boomer will remember as the ""risqu&eacute; foreign film"". Well having watched it I found very little to like. A disjointed, depressing story (nothing new to a Bergman film) but even more disheartening--a poorly developed character study. Lars, the boy, is the only sympathetic character in the film. Beyond the two main characters we don't get to know anyone else in this story to any depth at all. The summer on the island is but a very brief part of the story--and it didn't seem to be all that happy and carefree as touted to be. The film is described as ""sensual"" and one of Bergman's most important films! I simply can't agree. Compared to a film such a ""The Silence"" which is admittedly a difficult film to watch is nevertheless just packed to the brim with character development, tension, and sensuality. But in then I suppose you would just have to watch it yourself and form your own opinion.",3,"Short, sour summer!",1340236800,"06 21, 2012",2012,1256,"['Big', 'fan', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'body', 'work', 'greatest', 'films', 'cinematic', 'history', 'Films', 'set', 'benchmark', 'inspired', 'doubt', 'thousands', 'budding', 'directors', 'one', 'works', 'just', 'never', 'got', 'watching', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'escaped', 'famous', 'own', 'right', 'inspiring', 'what', 'Baby', 'Boomer', 'will', 'remember', 'risqu', 'eacute', 'foreign', 'film', 'Well', 'having', 'watched', 'found', 'very', 'little', 'like', 'disjointed', 'depressing', 'story', 'nothing', 'new', 'Bergman', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'disheartening', 'poorly', 'developed', 'character', 'study', 'Lars', 'boy', 'only', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'film', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'know', 'anyone', 'else', 'story', 'depth', 'summer', 'island', 'very', 'brief', 'part', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'happy', 'carefree', 'touted', 'be', 'film', 'described', 'sensual', 'one', 'Bergman', 'most', 'important', 'films', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'agree', 'Compared', 'film', 'Silence', 'admittedly', 'difficult', 'film', 'watch', 'nevertheless', 'just', 'packed', 'brim', 'character', 'development', 'tension', 'sensuality', 'then', 'suppose', 'would', 'just', 'have', 'watch', 'form', 'own', 'opinion']",N/A
