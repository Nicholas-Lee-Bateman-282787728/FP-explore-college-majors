The 'stars' are not too well known and the script, well, let's just say it leaves a bit to be desired. At least the voice-over narration by the main character keeps us apprised of what's going on, sort of, but the constant screen shot time signatures are a bit pretentious. At least the whole thing isn't too long, but there's a bit too much gratuitous violence. And some of the acting is amateurish at best.",2,A B- movie at best,1250985600,"08 23, 2009",2009,465,"['Looks', 'low', 'budget', 'direct', 'dvd', 'movie', 'one', ""'stars"", 'are', 'not', 'too', 'well', 'known', 'script', 'well', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'bit', 'be', 'desired', 'least', 'voice-over', 'narration', 'main', 'character', 'apprised', 'what', 'going', 'sort', 'constant', 'screen', 'shot', 'time', 'signatures', 'are', 'bit', 'pretentious', 'least', 'whole', 'thing', ""n't"", 'too', 'long', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'acting', 'amateurish', 'best']",Dark World

Boy, was I disappointed.  Boring plot that jumps over the place and hard to follow.

It almost reminded me of a bad soap opera type theme as maybe a few other films I have seen have.  Seemed like I was watching the clock just to see when it was going to end.

Once you know the end, watching it again, changes how you ""see"" the actors responses.Pare` is really good in it once you understand his actions which are kind of bland through most of the movie until the final scenes where he comes on strong. Russell is great with her script. Definitely worth a bit of change.",4,"Another ""got ya"" movie.",1235433600,"02 24, 2009",2009,452,"['actually', 'liked', 'movie', 'lot', 'mostly', 'getting', 'end', 'was', 'SO', 'surprised', 'went', 'form', 'just', 'OK', 'way', 'cool', 'Once', 'know', 'end', 'watching', 'again', 'how', 'see', 'actors', 'responses.Pare', 'really', 'good', 'once', 'understand', 'actions', 'are', 'kind', 'bland', 'most', 'movie', 'final', 'scenes', 'where', 'strong', 'Russell', 'great', 'script', 'Definitely', 'bit', 'change']",Dark World
