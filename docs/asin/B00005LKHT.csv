663544,A3EBHHCZO6V2A4,B00005LKHT,"Amaranth ""music fan""","[1, 1]","""The James Dean Story"" is a fascinating documentary,an early,low-key masterpiece by Robert Altman. It's completely in B&W;,made not long after Dean's untimely death in a car accident. Altman uses stills,interviews with Dean's friends/family,and clips from his movies powerfully. Dean died in the '50s,preceding the other well-known American icons, Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley. He made only 3 films,yet he retains immortality as an all-American rebel.James Dean grew up in rural Indiana. He loved farming,caring for animals,painting,playing basketball (he looked geeky,yet hot in glasses) He was a serious actor. He cared about giving his characters depth--something rarely seen among young actors these days. With his self-destructive streak,he sabotaged himself with the Actors' Studio,a Broadway play. He was a young man in search of himself. He was intensely lonely and artistic. He was a sensitive,sympathetic man. Beneath all his blustery rebelliousness was a boy who lost his mother,longing for a family.InEast of Eden (Two-Disc Special Edition),he starred as the unloved older brother in a retelling of the Cain and Abel story. InRebel Without a Cause (Two-Disc Special Edition),he was a teenaged boy who helps a young girl (Natalie Wood,who also died prematurely) and a fatherless boy (Sal Mineo). InGiant (Two-Disc Special Edition),opposite Rock Hudson and Liz Taylor,he starred as a Texas oil tycoon. Dean showed much promise.""The James Dean Story"" is a classic documentary,and it's also heartbreaking. Dean was buried in his hometown of Fairmount,Indiana,instead of some place like Forest Lawn or Graceland. He returned to his roots. Dean was a meteor in the sky of celebrity.

663548,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,B00005LKHT,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[1, 2]","There is something very appealing about a documentary that dares to psychologize its subject (if not to the point of the Self digression), because so many documentaries, these days, try to feign objectivity to the breaking point, even when, ala Michael Moore, their position- pro or con, is manifest from the get-go. Similarly, the personal accounts of Dean seem far more genuine than later documentaries in which interviewees seem to mug for the camera, and pull apocryphal tales out of their asses, just to get their own lousy fifteen minutes in the sun. The interviewees here are speaking contemporaneously, before Dean's legend really took off, and there is none of the deliberate or unintended fuzzing of memories towards the better angels of Dean's nature.The lone exception to this particular good quality of the film, is a scene where Altman gets the family and friends of Dean to re-enact their reactions to first hearing of Dean's death in a car crash of his Porsche on September 30th, 1955. What makes this section so poor a piece of filmmaking is the fact that earlier, we get to listen to a surreptitiously recorded `real' conversation between Dean and his relatives, and the contrast between that and the `scripted' parts is so great. Also, the film makes good use of the slow panning technique over still photographs that would later be used so successfully by documentarian Ken Burns. However, a caveat should be noted, and that is that the reason the technique works so well in the film is that the source photos are so intriguing. Yes, Dean comes off as a terminal narcissist, but he really did know how to strike the pose, and surround himself with photographer pals to immortalize himself.That said, the film, even at its mere 79 minutes of length, tends to wear a bit thin after the hour mark, because the reality is that Dean, despite this film's best intentions and claims, was not a particularly good actor. He was a relentless and born ham, and one need only watch Marlon Brando and Montgomery Clift, vis-&agrave;-vis Dean, to see the gulf between good and mediocre Method actors. Yet, while scenes from his films are few, there are some good passages with some of Dean's friends from New York and Los Angeles restaurants, some outtakes from films, newsreels of the opening of Giant, and a Public Service Announcement for safe driving, which more than make up for the film's deficiencies. Thus, The James Dean Story is a film and DVD worth watching, even if there are no extras, for its dated style becomes that rare quality that enhances even as it detracts.
