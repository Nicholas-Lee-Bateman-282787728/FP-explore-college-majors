1098946,A3GGMPRYCQ87CY,B000V6LSJU,The Cool Guy,"[1, 1]","This was one of the crummiest movies I've ever seen. I can't believe I wasted $1.25 and an hour and a half of my life on this. Cheesy, soap-opera-ey acting, stupid dialogue, and even stupider characters. (The priest in particular was incredibly unbelievable.) The story was par for the course, but didn't make much sense even as far as those goes. Also, the budget was laughably low. When the Beast stands before his massive group of worshippers, there's about 5 people standing there. Also, it looks like they filmed it all in some back alley somewhere in L.A., maybe in the San Pornando valley...Speaking of which, I had read where the other reviewer said it had more sex and nudity than an X-rated film. Well, I kept hoping for that. I was thinking that would be the one good thing about this movie, you know? But on that count, this movie massively underdelivers. Apparently whoever wrote that doesn't watch many X-rated movies, because what meager sex scene there was wouldn't even pass as softcore on Showtime. Really weak.There were a lot of ""freak out"" moments thrown in, for some reason. I never quite got that. None of it made much sense really. The bad mentor guy never seemed to shut up; I got really sick of him after a while. The priest with his silly accent fell into the ""so bad he's good"" category. The main hero / protagonist / antagonist / whatever looked the part maybe, and his performance was earnest. But he's so uncharismatic that he never comes off as more than an overpaid soap star. That or the writing gave him nothing to work with.The Antichrist's motivations in this is what could have been cool, but fell totally flat. One scene, he's good. The next, he's drinking blood. It never shows why he turns to evil. Never shows any pain in his soul, or desire for anything greater than himself. It also completely skips over him having to kill HIS OWN SON. You'd think the movie would have reflected on that for at least one second perhaps...In short, I've got nothing against low-budget movies, but this plain sucked. If you want to watch a GOOD end times / antichrist movie, check out ""The Omen III: The Final Conflict"", starring Sam Neill. Now THAT is an awesome movie! Even if it is 30 years old :)",1,Lame,1303689600,"04 25, 2011",2011,2226,"['was', 'one', 'crummiest', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'wasted', '1.25', 'hour', 'half', 'life', 'Cheesy', 'soap-opera-ey', 'acting', 'stupid', 'dialogue', 'even', 'stupider', 'characters', 'priest', 'particular', 'was', 'incredibly', 'unbelievable', 'story', 'was', 'par', 'course', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'even', 'as', 'far', 'Also', 'budget', 'was', 'laughably', 'low', 'When', 'Beast', 'massive', 'group', 'worshippers', '5', 'people', 'standing', 'there', 'Also', 'filmed', 'back', 'alley', 'somewhere', 'L.A.', 'maybe', 'San', 'Pornando', 'valley', 'Speaking', 'had', 'read', 'where', 'other', 'reviewer', 'said', 'had', 'more', 'sex', 'nudity', 'X-rated', 'film', 'Well', 'kept', 'hoping', 'was', 'thinking', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'good', 'thing', 'movie', 'know', 'count', 'movie', 'massively', 'underdelivers', 'Apparently', 'whoever', 'wrote', ""n't"", 'watch', 'many', 'X-rated', 'movies', 'what', 'meager', 'sex', 'scene', 'was', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'pass', 'softcore', 'Showtime', 'Really', 'weak.There', 'were', 'lot', 'freak', 'out', 'moments', 'thrown', 'reason', 'never', 'quite', 'got', 'None', 'made', 'much', 'sense', 'really', 'bad', 'mentor', 'guy', 'never', 'seemed', 'shut', 'up', 'got', 'really', 'sick', 'while', 'priest', 'silly', 'accent', 'fell', 'so', 'bad', 'good', 'category', 'main', 'hero', '/', 'protagonist', '/', 'antagonist', '/', 'looked', 'part', 'maybe', 'performance', 'was', 'earnest', 'so', 'uncharismatic', 'never', 'off', 'more', 'overpaid', 'soap', 'star', 'writing', 'gave', 'nothing', 'work', 'with.The', 'Antichrist', 'motivations', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cool', 'fell', 'totally', 'flat', 'One', 'scene', 'good', 'next', 'drinking', 'blood', 'never', 'why', 'evil', 'Never', 'pain', 'soul', 'desire', 'anything', 'greater', 'also', 'completely', 'having', 'kill', 'HIS', 'OWN', 'SON', ""'d"", 'think', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'reflected', 'least', 'one', 'second', 'perhaps', 'short', ""'ve"", 'got', 'nothing', 'low-budget', 'movies', 'plain', 'sucked', 'want', 'watch', 'GOOD', 'end', 'times', '/', 'antichrist', 'movie', 'check', 'Omen', 'III', 'Final', 'Conflict', 'starring', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'Now', 'THAT', 'awesome', 'movie', 'Even', '30', 'years', 'old']",N/A
