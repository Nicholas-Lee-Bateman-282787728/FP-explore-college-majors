1039460,AM6SOTOKGRZGA,B000LE1GEO,Jerry McDaniel,"[3, 3]","***SPOILERS INCLUDED***This episode of the legendary country music show comes from 1983 and it's notable as George Strait's only appearance. George performs two songs, ""Amarillo By Morning"" and ""A Fire I Can't Put Out"". He appears in the Kornfield and delivers some one-liners plus delivers the name of his home town, which gets the Hee-Haw Salute treatment. There's a quick one-liner by Strait edited into the scene after a particularly sensual Hee-Haw Honey is through delivering a line.The two hosts, Buck Owens and Roy Clark, are featured in music numbers which was customary each week. Buck performs ""There's Something About Me that She Loves"" and Roy does a musical number with his musical family called ""Heel and Toe Polka"".Don Harron's hilarious sketch as the KORN news reporter is featured along with the weather girl, which was a feature during this era in the show's run. The Naggers appear in a skit with a coming of age theme where their son, Elrod, jokes around with his father about how nice looking women make him feel. Ida Lee can't stand the father-son conversation and by skit's end she's hitting them over the head with whatever she can grab.The opening skit is the ""Hee-Haw Honky Tonk"" which was part of the show in the early to mid 1980's during the Urban Cowboy era in country music. Each week Roy and Buck would sit atop a bandstand and Buck would play his red, white, and blue guitar and Roy played the banjo and they'd sing musical interludes in between bad jokes told by several members of the cast who were all seated in the honky tonk. Jackie Phelps played the bartender.The Statler Brothers do appear a lot but they're so funny...especially in the Kornfield when they run a blooper reel of the four of them trying to get through a mother-in-law joke. A lot of people do not realize that the Statler Brothers were equally famous for their comedic banter...they even did a comedy album called ""Lester Roadhog Moran"" and several other humorous recordings under the Roadhog banner...so it shouldn't come as no surprise that the Hee-Haw producer would want to use a guest's comedic qualities.The four of them do the ""Gloom, Despair, and Agony"" skit and the ""Pffft! You Was Gone!"" skit as well. For the latter, Harold sings the lyrics and elbows Don and Phil but they keep their backs to the camera...as Harold fakes nervousness as the skit is ""not going as planned"" he reaches over and taps Jimmy but he too remains with his back to the camera...and just as they get to the part where they climax with ""Pffttt!!! You Was Gone"" they all turn around and do the bronx cheer on Harold, who ducks out of the way. They perform ""Guilty"" and ""I Get So Lonely"".In my opinion, though, this is just ONE show regardless of the fact the regular cast-members who typically appeared on those two aforementioned skits were replaced on this show by the Statler Brothers. The show is still just as humorous and entertaining as ever.The original air-date for this episode was November 12, 1983. It was the 9th episode during the 1983-1984 season and the three hundred seventy second episode {372} in all.Be on the look out for a cameo by Shotgun Red, the puppet that was just starting to become a favorite during that decade.",5,Strait to the hee-haw,1240185600,"04 20, 2009",2009,3231,"['***SPOILERS', 'INCLUDED***This', 'episode', 'legendary', 'country', 'music', 'show', '1983', 'notable', 'George', 'Strait', 'only', 'appearance', 'George', 'two', 'songs', 'Amarillo', 'Morning', 'A', 'Fire', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Put', 'Out', 'Kornfield', 'one-liners', 'name', 'home', 'town', 'Hee-Haw', 'Salute', 'treatment', 'quick', 'one-liner', 'Strait', 'edited', 'scene', 'particularly', 'sensual', 'Hee-Haw', 'Honey', 'delivering', 'line.The', 'two', 'hosts', 'Buck', 'Owens', 'Roy', 'Clark', 'are', 'featured', 'music', 'numbers', 'was', 'customary', 'week', 'Buck', 'Something', 'Me', 'Roy', 'musical', 'number', 'musical', 'family', 'called', 'Heel', 'Toe', 'Polka', '.Don', 'Harron', 'hilarious', 'sketch', 'KORN', 'news', 'reporter', 'featured', 'weather', 'girl', 'was', 'feature', 'era', 'show', 'run', 'Naggers', 'appear', 'skit', 'coming', 'age', 'theme', 'where', 'son', 'Elrod', 'around', 'father', 'how', 'nice', 'looking', 'women', 'make', 'feel', 'Ida', 'Lee', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'father-son', 'conversation', 'skit', 'end', 'hitting', 'head', 'can', 'grab.The', 'opening', 'skit', 'Hee-Haw', 'Honky', 'Tonk', 'was', 'part', 'show', 'early', 'mid', '1980', 'Urban', 'Cowboy', 'era', 'country', 'music', 'week', 'Roy', 'Buck', 'would', 'sit', 'atop', 'bandstand', 'Buck', 'would', 'play', 'red', 'white', 'blue', 'guitar', 'Roy', 'played', 'banjo', ""'d"", 'sing', 'musical', 'interludes', 'bad', 'jokes', 'told', 'several', 'members', 'cast', 'who', 'were', 'seated', 'honky', 'tonk', 'Jackie', 'Phelps', 'played', 'bartender.The', 'Statler', 'Brothers', 'do', 'appear', 'lot', ""'re"", 'so', 'funny', 'especially', 'Kornfield', 'when', 'run', 'blooper', 'reel', 'four', 'trying', 'get', 'mother-in-law', 'joke', 'lot', 'people', 'do', 'not', 'realize', 'Statler', 'Brothers', 'were', 'equally', 'famous', 'comedic', 'banter', 'even', 'did', 'comedy', 'album', 'called', 'Lester', 'Roadhog', 'Moran', 'several', 'other', 'humorous', 'recordings', 'Roadhog', 'banner', 'should', ""n't"", 'come', 'surprise', 'Hee-Haw', 'producer', 'would', 'want', 'use', 'guest', 'comedic', 'qualities.The', 'four', 'do', 'Gloom', 'Despair', 'Agony', 'skit', 'Pffft', 'Was', 'Gone', 'skit', 'as', 'well', 'latter', 'Harold', 'lyrics', 'Don', 'Phil', 'keep', 'backs', 'camera', 'Harold', 'nervousness', 'skit', 'not', 'going', 'planned', 'taps', 'Jimmy', 'too', 'back', 'camera', 'just', 'get', 'part', 'where', 'climax', 'Pffttt', 'Was', 'Gone', 'turn', 'around', 'do', 'bronx', 'cheer', 'Harold', 'who', 'way', 'perform', 'Guilty', 'Get', 'So', 'Lonely', '.In', 'opinion', 'though', 'just', 'ONE', 'show', 'regardless', 'fact', 'regular', 'cast-members', 'who', 'typically', 'appeared', 'two', 'aforementioned', 'skits', 'were', 'replaced', 'show', 'Statler', 'Brothers', 'show', 'still', 'just', 'humorous', 'entertaining', 'ever.The', 'original', 'air-date', 'episode', 'was', 'November', '12', '1983', 'was', '9th', 'episode', '1983-1984', 'season', 'three', 'hundred', 'seventy', 'second', 'episode', '372', 'all.Be', 'look', 'out', 'cameo', 'Shotgun', 'Red', 'puppet', 'was', 'just', 'starting', 'become', 'favorite', 'decade']",The Hee Haw Collection
