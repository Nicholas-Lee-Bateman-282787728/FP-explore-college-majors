And 'those' appearing in interviews in this production include the following: Mary Soames (Churchill's Daughter), Winston Churchill (his grandson), Celia Sandys (his granddaughter), & John Thurso (Liberal leader Archibald Sinclair's grandson); as well as 3 personal secretaries of Churchill, a private secretary, an interpreter, a telephone censor, a security officer, and a former duty officer of the White House map room. But unlike what you might expect herein we don't see a lot of Churchill himself & even less of Churchill on film actually speaking (not much more than 5 minutes of him speaking on film is shown). Instead, the director has utilized a Churchill look-a-like to walk the grounds of Churchill's actual country estate, dabble with paint canvases, gaze out of windows, and labor over a desk while a voice-over tells us what was going on in Churchill's life at the time. Some footage of Churchill is employed, but only in a ancillary role. We also hear a voice-over read the contents of letters handled by the director's Churchill stand-in. Unfortunately, at times this voice isn't even Churchill's either, but another actor's. (In the credits under ""Voice of Churchill"" is listed the name of John Baddeley.) Back to the substance of this production (by British Carlton TV---PBS being only involved in distributing it). Part One, concerning Churchill prior to the 1930s, entitled ""Destiny,"" ends with this quote: ""Churchill was 56 years old, his political career seemed to be over, his destiny unfulfilled."" Then Part 2 (""The Lion's Roar"") skims over most of the 30s in approximately 10 minutes, explaining nothing of how Churchill survived being in ""the wilderness"" for upwards of a decade; mentioning only, as a bridge, that Churchill, ""stubborn as ever [ ] continued to speak out about a much greater threat---Nazi Germany."" 6 minutes later he is back in power as First Lord of the Admiralty. So, the focus of this program is rather diverse you could say. Less than a sixth of this progam addresses the era of World War Two and no mention of religion is ever mentioned and, as I've already indicated, we see a lot more of the actor stand-in portraying Churchill pace rooms, smoke cigars, and cast serious gazes then we see of Churchill himself herein. In other words, do try to listen to some of Churchill's actual speeches, see more film footage of him, the fine film ""The Gathering Storm"" (starring Albert Finney), & perhaps read Jon Meacham's ""Franklin & Winston,"" to gain more of a feel for what made Churchill such a significant historical individual as well as a fascinating larger-than-life man.

Not that there aren't moments where the production is critical of Churchill's various blunders, but the criticism is usually pretty brief & quickly overwhelmed by heroic-sounding music and the ""march towards destiny"" nonsense.  The complete reliance on ""people who knew him"" really renders this whole production quite useless.  The only people who knew him who are still alive to give interviews are children and grandchildren of Churchill & various other historical figures; any colleagues who might have worked with him were only in the most junior stages of their careers and I rather doubt they were in a position to evaluate Churchill & his actions.The family members certainly aren't; it's impossible to expect Lady Soames and the quite loathesome Winston Spencer-Churchill to have any objectivity when it comes to discussing Sir Winston, and they certainly don't disappoint in that regard.  They are only useful when it comes to personal reminiscences, not when it comes to evaluating policy.  The same can be said for some the other ""children of so-and-so"" who appear in this production; while David Lloyd George's grandson Robert might be a very nice man, how on earth is he more qualified than a historian or biographer to discuss Churchill's role in the Lloyd George ministry?  And if they feel compelled only to use family members, why not use people with credentials like Margaret MacMillan, who is a Lloyd George descendent BUT also is a respected historian?Really, this whole ""rendezvous with destiny"" take on Churchill has already been done so many times, I don't why another entry is needed.
