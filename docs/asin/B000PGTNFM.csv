1070797,AGEIT17HENDIS,B000PGTNFM,Alfred Johnson,"[12, 23]","The sailors of the Baltic Fleet stationed at Kronstadt on the entranceway to Petrograd played a vanguard and heroic role in the various stages leading up to, and including, the October revolution in Russia in 1917. The sailors of the Baltic Fleet played a vanguard and heroic role in defending that revolution on the many fronts of the three-year Civil War against the Whites. According to the premise of this docudrama, tinged as it is in anarchist and anti-communist colors, the Kronstadt sailors also played a vanguard role in defending the premises of that revolution in their uprising against the seemingly power-crazed Bolsheviks in 1921.That is where Bolshevik sympathizers, including this writer, part company with the creators of this work on the virtues, especially the political virtues, of the sailors. And it is, whether viewed tragically or not, also the point of departure for those who saw the necessity of defending the Bolshevik experiment, arms in hand, as it lay prostrate after years of civil war and those who later, mainly from their cozy armchairs, made this the definitive point of the degeneration of the revolution of 1917. Moreover, apparently until the end of times someone, somewhere, in some cozy armchair, is going to pose the question of the Kronstadt uprising of 1921 as the defining moment in the process of degeneration of the Russian revolution. I, like the exiled Bolshevik Left-Oppositionist Leon Trotsky, ask the simple question- why? For what purpose? (See archives article entitled Hue and Cry Over Kronstadt, written by Trotsky in 1938).This two-part docudrama (The Fight For Freedom and Civil War) adequately highlights the social facts that made the Baltic sailors play an important role in the various stages of the revolution during 1917. Their skill levels, their camaraderie and their ties to the peasantry and working class back home made them a lynchpin for all kinds of actions planned by the Bolsheviks once the sailors were won to the need for decisive actions. In fact, as the docudrama points out, at a couple of points-the April and July Days they were ahead of the curve of the revolution. Moreover, the sailors played a decisive role in the actual physical overthrow of the Provisional Government in October and later the dispersal of the Constituent Assembly. Throughout the period, however, one should recognize that they did not act as an independent revolutionary factor but acted, for the most part, as agents of a civilian revolutionary party- Lenin's Bolsheviks.Needless to say when the storm clouds of civil war raised its head with the uprising of the Czech Legion and the intervention of the united imperialist powers the Kronstadt sailors were at their posts, especially at the critical moments in front of Kazan. They laid down their heads on all the fronts. I should note here that the pen name that I use in this space, Markin, is to honor one of those heroic sailors who laid down his head on one of the many fronts being contested by the Red and White Armies. It is also rather germane to note here that the bulk of the cadre sailors from 1917 either shared Markin's fate, took administrative jobs with the Bolshevik government of otherwise provided service to the revolution. The upshot, of all this, is to point out, as Trotsky did, that those sailors who rose against the Bolsheviks in 1921 were not the same cadre that performed heroic service earlier.That view has been contested, and is contested here by some of the inevitable `talking heads' that are interspersed between various action segments. And that is the rub. As pointed out up above the creators of this film have their own axes to grind. So we get the inevitable diabolical Lenin and the Bolsheviks as the personification of evil, all hungry bureaucrats ready to pounce on any political opposition. In short, the traditional anarchist/anti-communist litany that we have heard for the past 90 years.  Here, beyond the specific chronology of the Kronstadt uprising itself (and the point Trotsky was trying to make in his 1938 article mentioned above) is the key question of when the revolution degenerated  (the whys and what to do about it we will leave for another time).I would argue that if 1921 is the point of qualitative degeneration (and therefore the point that a third revolution is necessary) then the whole Bolshevik experiment was wrong from the beginning. That means, and here we have the benefit of hindsight such as it is, that the working class is organically incapable of making a working class revolution to implement socialism. I do not subscribe to that opinion but that should send those who are stuck intellectually imprisoned in Kronstadt 1921 cause for pause.",4,The Russian Revolution in Red and Black,1208217600,"04 15, 2008",2008,4725,"['sailors', 'Baltic', 'Fleet', 'stationed', 'Kronstadt', 'entranceway', 'Petrograd', 'played', 'vanguard', 'heroic', 'role', 'various', 'stages', 'leading', 'up', 'including', 'October', 'revolution', 'Russia', '1917', 'sailors', 'Baltic', 'Fleet', 'played', 'vanguard', 'heroic', 'role', 'defending', 'revolution', 'many', 'fronts', 'three-year', 'Civil', 'War', 'Whites', 'According', 'premise', 'docudrama', 'tinged', 'anarchist', 'anti-communist', 'colors', 'Kronstadt', 'sailors', 'also', 'played', 'vanguard', 'role', 'defending', 'premises', 'revolution', 'uprising', 'seemingly', 'power-crazed', 'Bolsheviks', '1921.That', 'where', 'Bolshevik', 'sympathizers', 'including', 'writer', 'part', 'company', 'creators', 'work', 'virtues', 'especially', 'political', 'virtues', 'sailors', 'viewed', 'tragically', 'not', 'also', 'point', 'departure', 'who', 'saw', 'necessity', 'defending', 'Bolshevik', 'experiment', 'arms', 'hand', 'lay', 'prostrate', 'years', 'civil', 'war', 'who', 'later', 'mainly', 'cozy', 'armchairs', 'made', 'definitive', 'point', 'degeneration', 'revolution', '1917', 'Moreover', 'apparently', 'end', 'times', 'someone', 'somewhere', 'cozy', 'armchair', 'going', 'pose', 'question', 'Kronstadt', 'uprising', '1921', 'defining', 'moment', 'process', 'degeneration', 'Russian', 'revolution', 'exiled', 'Bolshevik', 'Left-Oppositionist', 'Leon', 'Trotsky', 'ask', 'simple', 'question-', 'why', 'what', 'purpose', 'See', 'archives', 'article', 'entitled', 'Hue', 'Cry', 'Over', 'Kronstadt', 'written', 'Trotsky', '1938', '.This', 'two-part', 'docudrama', 'Fight', 'Freedom', 'Civil', 'War', 'adequately', 'social', 'facts', 'made', 'Baltic', 'sailors', 'play', 'important', 'role', 'various', 'stages', 'revolution', '1917', 'skill', 'levels', 'camaraderie', 'ties', 'peasantry', 'working', 'class', 'back', 'home', 'made', 'lynchpin', 'kinds', 'actions', 'planned', 'Bolsheviks', 'once', 'sailors', 'were', 'won', 'need', 'decisive', 'actions', 'fact', 'docudrama', 'out', 'couple', 'points-the', 'April', 'July', 'Days', 'were', 'ahead', 'curve', 'revolution', 'Moreover', 'sailors', 'played', 'decisive', 'role', 'actual', 'physical', 'overthrow', 'Provisional', 'Government', 'October', 'later', 'dispersal', 'Constituent', 'Assembly', 'period', 'however', 'one', 'should', 'recognize', 'did', 'not', 'act', 'independent', 'revolutionary', 'factor', 'acted', 'most', 'part', 'agents', 'civilian', 'revolutionary', 'party-', 'Lenin', 'Bolsheviks.Needless', 'say', 'when', 'storm', 'clouds', 'civil', 'war', 'raised', 'head', 'uprising', 'Czech', 'Legion', 'intervention', 'united', 'imperialist', 'powers', 'Kronstadt', 'sailors', 'were', 'posts', 'especially', 'critical', 'moments', 'front', 'Kazan', 'laid', 'down', 'heads', 'fronts', 'should', 'note', 'here', 'pen', 'name', 'use', 'space', 'Markin', 'honor', 'one', 'heroic', 'sailors', 'who', 'laid', 'down', 'head', 'one', 'many', 'fronts', 'being', 'contested', 'Red', 'White', 'Armies', 'also', 'rather', 'germane', 'note', 'here', 'bulk', 'cadre', 'sailors', '1917', 'shared', 'Markin', 'fate', 'took', 'administrative', 'jobs', 'Bolshevik', 'government', 'otherwise', 'provided', 'service', 'revolution', 'upshot', 'point', 'out', 'Trotsky', 'did', 'sailors', 'who', 'rose', 'Bolsheviks', '1921', 'were', 'not', 'same', 'cadre', 'performed', 'heroic', 'service', 'view', 'been', 'contested', 'contested', 'here', 'inevitable', 'talking', 'heads', 'are', 'interspersed', 'various', 'action', 'segments', 'rub', 'pointed', 'out', 'creators', 'film', 'have', 'own', 'axes', 'grind', 'get', 'inevitable', 'diabolical', 'Lenin', 'Bolsheviks', 'personification', 'evil', 'hungry', 'bureaucrats', 'ready', 'pounce', 'political', 'opposition', 'short', 'traditional', 'anarchist/anti-communist', 'litany', 'have', 'heard', 'past', '90', 'years', 'Here', 'specific', 'chronology', 'Kronstadt', 'uprising', 'point', 'Trotsky', 'was', 'trying', 'make', '1938', 'article', 'mentioned', 'key', 'question', 'when', 'revolution', 'degenerated', 'whys', 'what', 'do', 'will', 'leave', 'time', 'would', 'argue', '1921', 'point', 'qualitative', 'degeneration', 'therefore', 'point', 'third', 'revolution', 'necessary', 'then', 'whole', 'Bolshevik', 'experiment', 'was', 'wrong', 'beginning', 'here', 'have', 'benefit', 'hindsight', 'such', 'working', 'class', 'organically', 'incapable', 'making', 'working', 'class', 'revolution', 'implement', 'socialism', 'do', 'not', 'subscribe', 'opinion', 'should', 'send', 'who', 'are', 'stuck', 'intellectually', 'imprisoned', 'Kronstadt', '1921', 'cause', 'pause']",Russian Revolution in Color

The historical facts are presented, including little details usually overlooked.Whereas previous depictions of the revolution focus on the Bolshevik leadership and ignore Kronstadt altogether, this particular documentary omits some of the parallel (to Kronstadt) events going on with the leadership, such that Stalin, Kamenev, Zinoviev and others are ignored---but this is not to the detriment of the documentary.
