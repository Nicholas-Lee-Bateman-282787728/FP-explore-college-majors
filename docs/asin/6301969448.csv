281041,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,6301969448,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[0, 0]","This is one of those early 80s slasher films that I was just never able to see....until now. As a fan of the genre, I try to see as many little or obscure films that I missed. That you just don't see airing anymore. This is one I have always heard about. I liked the premise, the title was classic, and Tom Hanks made his debut feature film appearance in this. It's gotta be one of those little slasher gems, right?....right? Well, not so much. Here we go....""He Knows You're Alone"" tells the tale of a serial killer who targets young women who are about to get married. So far, so good. After a great opening, the detective picks up on the killer's trail (and an explanation to the detective's connection to the killer is made). We then meet future Bride Amy (Caitlin O'Heaney), who is having doubts about her upcoming marriage, especially since her ex is always hanging around. It isn't long before the killer sets his sights on Amy, and she and her friends become new fodder for the bride killer.Released in 1980, the movie came out at a time where Halloween had already exploded, and Friday The 13th was released the same year. This was the beginning of the slasher boom. The movie definitely stole heavily from Carpenter's 1978 classic. The killer coming into view, the music, etc. The idea of the movie seems to be pretty new, but everything else comes from someone else. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, especially since these slasher movies are supposed to be fun and entertaining. The problem is that this movie doesn't do anything, and isn't all that fun, except for the opening minutes and finale. Star Caitlin O'Heaney(who later went on to star as Snow White on the short lived 80s sitcom ""The Charmings"") is a likable ""final girl"", but there isn't much else to offer. There are some decent mood settings here and there, but you get the feeling that the director isn't really in his genre. He knows the beats, but doesn't know exactly how to execute it, or work with a slasher script. Most of it is handled kinda clumsily, and the suspense and tension doesn't ever register too high on the fear meter. It's all photographed in the most workman-like way.What brings the movie down? I never liked the kinds of slashers where you see the killer as a human being. The killer here is dressed normally, and we see his face every time. For me, that has always lessened the impact whenever there are suspense and tension scenes. He isn't interesting, nor is there anything made clear about him. Pretty boring, laughable killer. Reminded me of the drill killer in ""The Slumber Party Massacre"". Then there is the 'slasher' aspect. The movie is relatively bloodless, the kills(with one exception involving a fish tank) are mundane, the killer stabbing comes off as comical and fake, etc. It doesn't even really succeed on being just a fun, mindless slasher. It's really a dull affair all the way around. The only moments of excitment and interest is in the opening and closing minutes of the movie. And, if you are expecting a lot of newcomer Tom Hanks, forget it. He's in two scenes and that is it. Another familiar face in the movie is Paul Gleason, principal Vernon from ""The Breakfast Club"", as well as other 80s classics such as ""Trading Places"" and ""Die Hard"".Interestingly enough, Caitlin O'Heaney has never married in real life. I guess the movie scared her too much.""He Knows You're Alone"" starts off great, and it has a fun ending. It's the drab, boring, bloodless stuff in between that makes it tough to get to the decent climax.",2,Does He Know When You're Bored?,1303862400,"04 27, 2011",2011,3544,"['one', 'early', '80s', 'slasher', 'films', 'was', 'just', 'never', 'able', 'see', '.until', 'now', 'fan', 'genre', 'try', 'see', 'many', 'little', 'obscure', 'films', 'missed', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'airing', 'anymore', 'one', 'have', 'always', 'heard', 'liked', 'premise', 'title', 'was', 'classic', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'made', 'debut', 'feature', 'film', 'appearance', 'got', 'ta', 'be', 'one', 'little', 'slasher', 'gems', 'right', '.right', 'Well', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'Here', 'go', ""'re"", 'Alone', 'tale', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'young', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'get', 'married', 'So', 'far', 'so', 'good', 'great', 'opening', 'detective', 'up', 'killer', 'trail', 'explanation', 'detective', 'connection', 'killer', 'made', 'then', 'meet', 'future', 'Bride', 'Amy', 'Caitlin', ""O'Heaney"", 'who', 'having', 'doubts', 'upcoming', 'marriage', 'especially', 'ex', 'always', 'hanging', 'around', ""n't"", 'long', 'killer', 'sights', 'Amy', 'friends', 'become', 'new', 'fodder', 'bride', 'killer.Released', '1980', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'time', 'where', 'Halloween', 'had', 'already', 'exploded', 'Friday', '13th', 'was', 'released', 'same', 'year', 'was', 'beginning', 'slasher', 'boom', 'movie', 'definitely', 'stole', 'heavily', 'Carpenter', '1978', 'classic', 'killer', 'coming', 'view', 'music', 'etc', 'idea', 'movie', 'be', 'pretty', 'new', 'everything', 'else', 'someone', 'else', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'especially', 'slasher', 'movies', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'problem', 'movie', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', ""n't"", 'fun', 'opening', 'minutes', 'finale', 'Star', 'Caitlin', ""O'Heaney"", 'who', 'later', 'went', 'star', 'Snow', 'White', 'short', 'lived', '80s', 'sitcom', 'Charmings', 'likable', 'final', 'girl', ""n't"", 'much', 'else', 'offer', 'are', 'decent', 'mood', 'settings', 'here', 'there', 'get', 'feeling', 'director', ""n't"", 'really', 'genre', 'beats', ""n't"", 'know', 'exactly', 'how', 'execute', 'work', 'slasher', 'script', 'Most', 'handled', 'kinda', 'clumsily', 'suspense', 'tension', ""n't"", 'ever', 'register', 'too', 'high', 'fear', 'meter', 'photographed', 'most', 'workman-like', 'movie', 'down', 'never', 'liked', 'kinds', 'slashers', 'where', 'see', 'killer', 'human', 'being', 'killer', 'here', 'dressed', 'normally', 'see', 'face', 'time', 'always', 'lessened', 'impact', 'whenever', 'are', 'suspense', 'tension', 'scenes', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'anything', 'made', 'clear', 'Pretty', 'boring', 'laughable', 'killer', 'Reminded', 'drill', 'killer', 'Slumber', 'Party', 'Massacre', 'Then', ""'slasher"", 'aspect', 'movie', 'relatively', 'bloodless', 'kills', 'one', 'exception', 'involving', 'fish', 'tank', 'are', 'mundane', 'killer', 'stabbing', 'off', 'comical', 'fake', 'etc', ""n't"", 'even', 'really', 'succeed', 'being', 'just', 'fun', 'mindless', 'slasher', 'really', 'dull', 'affair', 'way', 'only', 'moments', 'excitment', 'interest', 'opening', 'closing', 'minutes', 'movie', 'are', 'expecting', 'lot', 'newcomer', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'forget', 'two', 'scenes', 'familiar', 'face', 'movie', 'Paul', 'Gleason', 'principal', 'Vernon', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'as', 'well', 'other', '80s', 'classics', 'such', 'Trading', 'Places', 'Die', 'Hard', '.Interestingly', 'enough', 'Caitlin', ""O'Heaney"", 'never', 'married', 'real', 'life', 'guess', 'movie', 'scared', 'too', 'much', ""'re"", 'Alone', 'off', 'great', 'fun', 'ending', 'drab', 'boring', 'bloodless', 'stuff', 'tough', 'get', 'decent', 'climax']",He Knows You're Alone VHS

He even slaughters a wedding dress designer! This guy really hates weddings! The female lead (Caitlin O'Heaney) is solid and not overly annoying. Unfortunately, much of this movie is predictable and slower than an arthritic tortoise. I kept waiting for the tension to build, but it just stayed at a constant level of medium.

While her friends reassure her that it's just pre-wedding jitters that's making her upset, the stranger closes in on Amy's friends and soon Amy alone is confronted by the man dogging her steps.This is an overlooked but decent early '80s slasher flick, though it shamelessly steals from Halloween to the point where it makes you wonder if John Carpenter considered taking legal action.  But it's still an enjoyable horror movie with some genuine suspense and scares, as well as some likable characters.  The opening sequence of Scream 2 parodied the opening of this movie years later.

That's the fairly tame tagline for He Knows You're Alone (1980) aka Blood Wedding, a fairly generic post Halloween (1978) slasher film that most notable probably because it was the first film Tom Hanks ever appeared in...Directed by Armand Mastroianni, who went on to direct mainly episodes of television series like Friday the 13th: The Series and War of the Worlds: The Second invasion, the film stars Caitlan O'Heaney, whom I most remember from the early 80's TV show Tales of the Gold Monkey.  Also appearing are Don Scardino (Squirm), James Rebhorn (Meet the Parents, Independence Day), Paul Gleason (Trading Places, The Breakfast Club, Die Hard), and, of course, Tom Hanks in a minor bit parts encompassing all of about 5 minutes of screen time.Okay, so here's the basic plot...Amy (O'Heaney) is about to be married.  Along with the usual problems, dress fittings, flower arrangements, etc., she's been noticing a mysterious figure everywhere she goes.  Turns out a killer is on the loose, and he seems to have a thing for brides to be...also, it seems the killer is somewhat known by the local police, as he's struck before, but had stopped for awhile, confounding the efforts of law enforcement to capture him...but now has returned and is up to his old ways again.  One detective in particular has a personal interest in seeing the serial killer stopped.  Anyway, Amy continues to be stalked, yet those around here think her sightings are due to nervousness of her impending nuptials, and don't take her seriously.  The killer not only stalks Amy, but begins finding victims in Amy's friends and those associated with the wedding in general (pity the poor tailor...).  Will Amy be able convince not only herself, but also her friends (the ones that are left) and the police of the existence of this mysterious killer before it's too late?  I hope so, because the reception hall isn't keen on returning the deposit...The first thing I noticed in He Know You're Alone is how much the musical score apes that of Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells, used so effectively in The Exorcist.  Often lesser films, especially within the horror genre, borrow from better films, but this just seemed a little too blatant for my tastes.  The characters are a bit hollow and lifeless, lacking any real chemistry, and don't do enough to really endear themselves to the audience which is pretty important as ideally you should be concerned for their welfare thus increasing the tension when danger is near.  I never really connected with any of the characters, so I cared little if they found themselves victims of the killer.  Also, the motivation of the killer never seemed clear (well, at least until the end, and even then, it was pretty translucent).  The whole idea of him killing women soon to be wed fell apart, as we soon saw this wasn't really the case, as victims were pretty much random.  There was no mystery (other than his motivations) to the killer as we saw his face often, and he didn't really present a formidable or fearsome nature (he looked like he got a lot of sun on his face while wearing large sunglasses, giving the effect of a rather large raccoon).  Even his methods of killing were rather bland, more or less stabbing his victims with knives.  There was a decapitation (not shown), which resulted in a horribly pathetic fake looking head in an odd place (I won't say where, as that would give too much away).  Also, there is little to no blood anywhere throughout the film (maybe it wasn't in the budget).  I don't really see how you can have a slasher film with no blood, unless they decided to `buck the trend', and try and focus the audience's attention on the suspense rather than the gore.  Fans of the genre like their blood, and will probably be disappointed.  There were a few tense and suspenseful moments, but so much of what was going to happen seemed entirely obvious that I found myself often guessing (correctly) how various particular scenes were going to end.  Another thing, I found it quite annoying how easily the killer gained access to many places undetected, almost as if he were able to `will' himself inside.  There are a few original moments within the film, but even those are kind of spoiled in that often they are dragged before the audience too long, as if to say ""look at this"", effectively draining the subtlety and spoiling the intended effect.  As mentioned by another reviewer, correctly, in my opinion, this whole film seems to be a paper-thin copy of Halloween, without any of the elements that made that film so good and fun to watch.  As I said before, the ending seemed a bit transparent, but provides a nice wrap around, and the reward was just to little, too late.  Basically what you have here is a mediocre film borrowing a bit too much from a better film, packing little punch (and blood).  I kind of see this film as being a primer for someone who hasn't experienced many horror films, especially those within the slasher genre.  Kinda like training wheels on a bicycle...try it out, see if you like it, and then move on to more advanced material.  If you're already there, then you might find a passing interest, but don't expect too much.The wide screen picture on this DVD looks excellent (to my surprise), and the audio comes through pretty clear.  Special features include a theatrical trailer, and a commentary track by the director Armand Mastroianni and screenwriter Scott Parker.  All in all, not a bad film, certainly serviceable, and retaining novelty value given it's Tom Hanks first screen appearance, but I would recommend Black Christmas (1974) for someone looking for a underrated and not often seen gem in the genre.Cookieman108",3,"The pre-wedding jitters, compounded by a case of ...MURDER",1097884800,"10 16, 2004",2004,5799,"['girl', 'frightened', 'night',

281048,A1YXGVAKHLCL26,6301969448,CryWolf854,"[0, 0]","Some hearts should never be broken.Poor Amy (Caitlin O'Heaney: 3:00 High, Savage Weekend), not only is she having second doubts about marrying her fiancee but she seems to have garnered some unwanted stalker attention from a complete stranger. She's seeing him everywhere, from her final fitting to buying an ice cream cone to even hiding in the shadows in the haunted house attraction at the local fairgrounds. Who is this guy and what does he want?Well, as luck would have it, Amy's new friend happens to be a man name Ray (Tom Rolfing) who was jilted by his bride to be and now holds a grudge against any young lady about to say her vows. Not only that, he has the former groom-to-be hot on his trail wanting to bring his own brand of justice to this second rate Michael Myers. Will he succeed or will Amy become the next blood splattered bride?After the phenomenal success of Halloween, slasher flicks became all the rage, especially holiday theme ones. He Knows You're Alone has taken a more personal holiday and made it the last few days leading up to every bride's big day. Yes, it borrows heavily from Halloween but then what slasher flick doesn't? Halloween borrowed from Black Christmas which in turn borrowed heavily from Silent Night Bloody Night.He Knows You're Alone is no classic and has largely remained forgotten and for good reasons. For a slasher flick, it lacks any real tension. Our heroine  continually makes the stupidest decisions such as locking the killer in a room behind a door that has a glass window in the center of it and then leaning against said door with the obvious result. Plus never once does she decide to call the police after each continuous encounter with the killer.  Its a miracle in and of itself that the guy just doesn't bump her off after the first five minutes. We also never know why Amy is having her doubts about marrying her fiancee Phil (James Carroll: Girls Nite Out). He seems like a nice enough guy and he isn't stalking her like her nerdy mortican ex-boyfriend Marvin (Don Scardino) who is always just casually popping up.But despite all its flaws, this movie isn't all that bad. It was made in the 80s and the film makers did strive to try and make it stand out from the rest of the crowd that would eventually follow. Like Final Exam, another largely forgotten slasher flick, Ray doesn't wear a mask. He simply stares with this blank, vacant face like the Stranger in When A Stranger Calls.  And we never really learn why he targets other brides-to-be. Yes he was dumped and he does stab his ex-fiancee to death a mere few hours before her wedding but is that any reason to keeping  picking off random women? And, unlike the rest, there is a rather shocking outcome for Amy.As a fan of the genre, I picked this up just for enjoyment of seeing it. I wasn't expecting much but I certainly got my $10 worth.

281049,A34IBXM7E8CPWE,6301969448,David Girod,"[0, 5]","""He Knows You're Alone"" isn't exactly an apt title considering most of the kills take place when the victim has at least one other person close by, but I guess ""He Knows You're Somewhat alone with Other People in the General Vicinity"" doesn't have quite the same ring? Right off the bat we learn the identity of the killer, so there is no mystery, which is fine if we are looking at a flat-out slasher with a high body count. But ""He Knows"" doesn't really come off as a straight slasher flick, it feels more like a mystery film. The body count is low, the special effects are limited, meaning very little gore. Quite a bit of the film is taken up by Don Scardino and the guy who played the principal in ""The Breakfast Club"" trying to find out when and where the ever-sweaty murderer will strike next. I would have been more generous in my review if there had been either a higher body count, or if we got to see more of the red stuff flow. My guess is, if this came out in theaters today it would have a PG-13 rating instead of R.I thought the acting was pretty good for a B-Level flick. The comic relief ex-boyfriend/morgue attendant guy was not annoying like most 80's slasher comic relief guys. And I am sure I am dating myself here, but when one of the actresses in the movie puts on these huge headphones and settles down on the floor to jam to some tunes with some.....refreshments. That took me right back to my High School days. I remember doing the same thing many times...only my head didn't later end up in the fish bowl.

With something like 75% of its duration dedicated to pointless errands, unnecessary supporting characters and a drab, one-way relationship drama, this is quite easily the least suspenseful thriller I've ever been unlucky enough to sit through. Even the kills are yawners, perpetrated by a hopelessly wacky, unexplained knifeman without a motive or even a loose pattern. He'll creep out from behind a curtain for a big scare, then stand around in confusion as his prey rushes past to a waiting doorway. At one point he desperately tries to nail down a quarry by furiously stabbing the windshield of their car. It's a total mess; before long it's useless even as fodder for a good riffing or unintentional comedy.

281052,A3OHB78Y7L7ZK,6301969448,GSD,"[0, 0]","The movie called ""He Knows You're Alone"" may be a blatant Halloween ripoff, but it is a great slasher film anyway, as the killer does seem pretty original. Most slasher films have the killer horribly disfigured or wearing a mask or both, but this killer is just a regular personified lunatic.This movie is criticized as a complete Halloween clone but its not. It blatantly steals many elements from Halloween, right down to similar music and even shots of the movie but it does contain a lot of originality in plot, villain and a very strong ending. These elements ultimately make the film a effective and suspenseful piece.In this film, the plot is laid out for the audience rather quickly and violently. A young girl about to get married is murdered in the beginning of the film by a creepy, mysterious and very angry man, who incidentally never speaks throughout the entire film. The audience comes to find out that this particular man is a very dangerous serial killer who HATES ""brides to be."" After the first girl is murdered in a scenario that mirrors the opening of SCREAM 2, the main character is introduced, a girl named Amy played by Caitlin O'Heaney who is about to have a wedding. The killer somehow finds out about it and he begins stalking her. She becomes paranoid and begins excessively watching her back. A detective in this movie named Len, who is obsessed with the killer just as Dr. Loomis was obsessed with Michael Myers, begins to pick up her trail and that leads to a confrontation with the killer.Perhaps this film's notoriety comes from the fact that this was mega star Tom Hanks' first film as he plays a small but competent role as a young jogger that another girl in the film becomes interested in romantically.In conclusion, ""He Knows You're Alone"" contains quite a few scary scenes in large part because the killer seems so manic, crazed,determined and violent. While it does borrow from Halloween, the movie does play on its variations enough to be convincing and entertaining in its own right.

281053,A3FUBUJAIGM87T,6301969448,"HorrorMan ""HM""","[12, 12]","The movie called ""He Knows You're Alone"" may be a Halloween ripoff, but it is a great slasher-horror flick anyway, so I just love it!!!!  I highly recommend this movie to horror movie fans, especially slasher film lovers.  Unfortunately, this movie has been unfairly criticized as a complete Halloween ripoff and therefore not worth watching.  While it may be true that this movie does borrow extensively from the immortal classic ""Halloween"", this movie is still very effective in that way and very successful on its own merits as well.Sure, the movie is a ""Halloween"" ripoff, but why not ripoff the greatest horror movie of all-time and tweak the plot with different variations and a different situation?  Then what do you get?  A very scary and successful slasher film which is very Halloweenesque yet has a character all its own.  First of all, I love John Carpenter's Halloween, so anything resembling that first movie, I have an affection for, so keep that in mind when reading my reviews.In this movie, the plot is laid out for the audience rather quickly and violently.  A young girl about to get married is murdered in the beginning of the film by a creepy, mysterious and very angry man, who incidentally never speaks throughout the entire film.  The audience comes to find out that this particular man is a very dangerous serial killer who HATES ""brides to be"" and in the killer's very sick mind, he has a reason for hating these brides.The audience is then introduced to the main character, a girl named Amy played by Caitlin O'Heaney who is about to have a wedding, and well, ""Ray"" or ""He Knows You're Alone Man"" finds out about it and he is not pleased...he becomes very angry about it.  In fact, he begins stalking her and she sees him around what seems like every corner, ""a la"" Michael Myers in John Carpenter's original masterpiece ""Halloween"".  In fact, ""He Knows You're Alone"" darn near steals John Carpenter's Halloween music as well, but again, the music created is very effective and very creepy even though it is borrowed somewhat from Halloween.The musical score of this movie is terrific as it provides excellent mood and theme sounds that was a hallmark of the superior movie ""Halloween"".  We also have a detective in this movie named Len, who is obsessed with the killer and we can see another parallel with that of Halloween as Dr. Loomis was obsessed with Michael Myers.  So, indeed, ""He Knows You're Alone"" is a Halloween ripoff but it is still very good even if it is not as good Halloween.  I suspect that anyone who liked the movie ""Halloween"" will also find this movie highly entertaining.""He Knows You're Alone"" contains quite a few scary scenes including some very nice death scenes.  And, make sure you checkout Amy's beautiful fish tank near the ending...I think you'll really like what Ray does with it.  I don't want to give everything away, but I recommend this movie to all horror movie fans, especially slasher film fanatics.In conclusion, ""He Knows You're Alone"" does borrow significantly from Halloween, but the movie does play on its variations enough to be convincing and entertaining in its own right.  The ending is certainly different and the only real criticism that I have of this movie is we don't know what happened to the killer as the killer becomes an afterthought of the movie, but in a way, that can be quite thought provoking in and of itself.Also, you might find it interesting that this was Tom Hanks' first film as he plays a small but competent role as a young jogger that another girl in the film becomes interersted in romantically.

The mood created, the (somewhat) likeable and relatable characters, and the overall feel of the film elevate it to classic status, meaning one that I personally would watch over and over and that doesn't happen a lot for me.

281055,AWN6ZMWWMUWLX,6301969448,J. Friday,"[1, 1]","I'm not going to big deal about Tom Hanks. His total screen time was only 5 minutes. His character added nothing to the story whatsoever. But everyone is making a big deal because it is his debut. Do I really need to make a big deal out of the debut performance of a big name actor? No.The story: a man's girl dumps him for another man. The dumped guy kills the woman an hour before her wedding. Then the killer goes on a killing spree of soon-to-be brides. The dead woman's fiance is a cop who spends years of his life trying to track the guy down.I felt it was quite suspense without having the dreary moodiness of 70s slasher films such as Silent Night, Bloody Night (a movie I kind of liked). There wasn't mystery here since the killer and his M.O. is revealed from the beginning. I thought the woman who played Amy was realistic in her terror. She didn't go hysterically over the top like some women do in horror movies where they are stalked by killers.The situations were believable, unlike today's horror. Ever watch ""I Know What You Did Last Summer""? A female character screams and runs away when she finds a messy corpse in her trunk. She returns to the trunk to find the corpse gone entirely. There isn't any blood. So the moviegoer is supposed to believe a killer would put a messy corpse in and out of a woman's trunk for no other reason than to scare her, and in this heavily populated town no one sees him walk around with a corpse in broad daylight? Come on!However, it is funny how even non-supernatural horror today can be unbelievable. Say what you will about 70s and 80s horror being boring, at least many of those flicks tried hard to be believable. In horror movies today, the victims will be be chased by the killer (sometimes for hours or days), go through rain, mud, snow, dirt, and other types of grime, and in the end, the she'll have her hair and makeup perfect. Aside from a few smudges of mud on her face and dirty clothes, she'll look good enough for a photoshoot for a prestigious fashion magazine. By contrast, the women in this movie actually look and act like the girl next door. Therefore, it's easy to emphasize with them. How about that, a horror movie with good characterization! We don't see that from horror flicks these days.All in all, I'd recommend this to people who want a quieter slasher flick. There is little to no blood in this movie. That proves gore isn't necessary to jolt the audience (but I still like gore, nevertheless). A good slasher flick needs good suspense, believable characters and situations, a steady pace, and grainy cinematography. I am one of those people who thinks today's horror suffers from the fact that the cinematography is too glossy, high quality, and thus loses the raunchy feel that grainy cinematography from decades ago have that make such an unsettling atmosphere.",4,Pretty Good,1362268800,"03 3, 2013",2013,2847,"[""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'big', 'deal', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'total', 'screen', 'time', 'was', 'only', '5', 'minutes', 'character', 'added', 'nothing', 'story', 'whatsoever', 'everyone', 'making', 'big', 'deal', 'debut', 'Do', 'really', 'need', 'make', 'big', 'deal', 'debut', 'performance', 'big', 'name', 'actor', 'No.The', 'story', 'man', 'girl', 'dumps', 'man', 'dumped', 'guy', 'woman', 'hour', 'wedding', 'Then', 'killer', 'killing', 'spree', 'soon-to-be', 'brides', 'dead', 'woman', 'fiance', 'cop', 'who', 'years', 'life', 'trying', 'track', 'guy', 'down.I', 'felt', 'was', 'quite', 'suspense', 'having', 'dreary', 'moodiness', '70s', 'slasher', 'films', 'such', 'Silent', 'Night', 'Bloody', 'Night', 'movie', 'kind', 'liked', 'was', ""n't"", 'mystery', 'here', 'killer', 'M.O', 'revealed', 'beginning', 'thought', 'woman', 'who', 'played', 'Amy', 'was', 'realistic', 'terror', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'hysterically', 'top', 'women', 'do', 'horror', 'movies', 'where', 'are', 'stalked', 'killers.The', 'situations', 'were', 'believable', 'today', 'horror', 'Ever', 'Know', 'What', 'Did', 'Last', 'Summer', 'female', 'character', 'screams', 'away', 'when', 'messy', 'corpse', 'trunk', 'trunk', 'find', 'corpse', 'gone', 'entirely', ""n't"", 'blood', 'moviegoer', 'supposed', 'believe', 'killer', 'would', 'put', 'messy', 'corpse', 'woman', 'trunk', 'other', 'reason', 'scare', 'heavily', 'populated', 'town', 'one', 'walk', 'corpse', 'broad', 'daylight', 'Come', 'However', 'funny', 'how', 'even', 'non-supernatural', 'horror', 'today', 'can', 'be', 'unbelievable', 'Say', 'what', 'will', 'about', '70s', '80s', 'horror', 'being', 'boring', 'least', 'many', 'flicks', 'tried', 'hard', 'be', 'believable', 'horror', 'movies', 'today', 'victims', 'will', 'be', 'be', 'chased', 'killer', 'sometimes', 'hours', 'days', 'go', 'rain', 'mud', 'snow', 'dirt', 'other', 'types', 'grime', 'end', ""'ll"", 'have', 'hair', 'makeup', 'perfect', 'Aside', 'few', 'smudges', 'mud', 'face', 'dirty', 'clothes', ""'ll"", 'look', 'good', 'enough', 'photoshoot', 'prestigious', 'fashion', 'magazine', 'contrast', 'women', 'movie', 'actually', 'look', 'act', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'Therefore', 'easy', 'emphasize', 'How', 'horror', 'movie', 'good', 'characterization', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'horror', 'flicks', 'days.All', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'quieter', 'slasher', 'flick', 'little', 'blood', 'movie', 'gore', ""n't"", 'necessary', 'jolt', 'audience', 'still', 'gore', 'nevertheless', 'good', 'slasher', 'flick', 'good', 'suspense', 'believable', 'characters', 'situations', 'steady', 'pace', 'grainy', 'cinematography', 'am', 'one', 'people', 'who', 'thinks', 'today', 'horror', 'suffers', 'fact', 'cinematography', 'too', 'glossy', 'high', 'quality', 'thus', 'raunchy', 'feel', 'grainy', 'cinematography', 'decades', 'ago', 'have', 'make', 'unsettling', 'atmosphere']",He Knows You're Alone VHS

281063,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,6301969448,Only-A-Child,"[2, 4]","This is now out on DVD with a commentary by Director Armand Mastroianni and Writer Scott Parker. The movie isn't much by itself but is worth watching with the commentary ""on"" if you enjoy observing self-delusion. They seem to actually believe that they made a very clever movie and Mastroianni name drops anyone or anything that ever said a kind word about anything he was involved with; I kept waiting for a reference to his third grade teacher's praise of his watercolor painting ability. But otherwise they seem like nice guys. The film was shot on Staton Island for about half its original budget and the commentary gives an interesting account of the various economy measures that were used to squeeze this thing out.Anyway this is a horror film from 1980; and like a lot of the stuff made at that time it shamelessly cheats rather than bother to create plausible scenarios for its plot elements. I've never been sure whether this type of cheating was due to lazy scriptwriting, budget issues, or because the producers of these things believed that audiences did not want to be scared ""too much"" and would welcome it when the suspense was destroyed by an absurd plot development. Certainly movies like ""Psycho"" and ""Silence of the Lambs"" are scarier because they go to some length to make the terror plausible. Even the first ""Jason"" and ""Halloween"" movies are scarier than their sequels for this same reason. But audiences paid to see this formula stuff throughout the 1980's so it must have been OK with fans of the genre at that time.In one moronically contrived scene the killer stands beside Caitlin's parked car and slaps listlessly at the windshield, a few seconds later (while hanging onto the roof of the speeding car) he smashes in the windshield with his fist. The climax is filmed inside a complex of fuhrer-bunker-like tunnels (actually an abandoned sanitarium) but the night establishing shot is of just one tiny brick building; where this tunnel maze came from is never explained.Anyway, the star of the film (and the only good reason to watch) is Caitlin O'Heaney (remember Snow White Charming). Although better suited to romantic comedy than to horror, O'Heaney is smart and beautiful and does fine in this role. Dana Barron (remember Audrey Griswald at Wally World) plays Caitlin's little sister, Tom Hanks has a minor role as a jogging college student, and Paul Gleason (Breakfast Club) has a minor role as a detective.Perhaps the most puzzling element of this film is the ""tribute to Hitchcock"" shower scene. Not because the girl is never actually attacked in the shower but because instead of a nude Caitlin (something you would want to see) they show a nude Elizabeth Kemp (something that you wish you had not seen...""must purge the image of her slug-like body from memory"").There are a few original elements in this film although most of them are teases; like setting the stage for a standard horror moment and then not pulling the trigger. It does have a clever twist at the end which you can guess if you have been paying attention but not until just a few seconds before it occurs.",3,We Like Caitlin O'Heaney,1116806400,"05 23, 2005",2005,3112,"['now', 'out', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'Director', 'Armand', 'Mastroianni', 'Writer', 'Scott', 'Parker', 'movie', ""n't"", 'much', 'worth', 'watching', 'commentary', 'enjoy', 'observing', 'self-delusion', 'seem', 'actually', 'believe', 'made', 'very', 'clever', 'movie', 'Mastroianni', 'name', 'anyone', 'anything', 'ever', 'said', 'kind', 'word', 'anything', 'was', 'involved', 'kept', 'waiting', 'reference', 'third', 'grade', 'teacher', 'praise', 'watercolor', 'painting', 'ability', 'otherwise', 'seem', 'nice', 'guys', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'Staton', 'Island', 'about', 'original', 'budget', 'commentary', 'interesting', 'account', 'various', 'economy', 'measures', 'were', 'used', 'squeeze', 'thing', 'out.Anyway', 'horror', 'film', '1980', 'lot', 'stuff', 'made', 'time', 'shamelessly', 'rather', 'bother', 'create', 'plausible', 'scenarios', 'plot', 'elements', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'sure', 'type', 'cheating', 'was', 'due', 'lazy', 'scriptwriting', 'budget', 'issues', 'producers', 'things', 'believed', 'audiences', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'be', 'scared', 'too', 'much', 'would', 'welcome', 'when', 'suspense', 'was', 'destroyed', 'absurd', 'plot', 'development', 'Certainly', 'movies', 'Psycho', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'are', 'scarier', 'go', 'length', 'make', 'terror', 'plausible', 'Even', 'first', 'Jason', 'Halloween', 'movies', 'are', 'scarier', 'sequels', 'same', 'reason', 'audiences', 'paid', 'see', 'formula', 'stuff', '1980', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'OK', 'fans', 'genre', 'time.In', 'one', 'moronically', 'contrived', 'scene', 'killer', 'beside', 'Caitlin', 'parked', 'car', 'listlessly', 'windshield', 'few', 'seconds', 'later', 'hanging', 'roof', 'speeding', 'car', 'windshield', 'fist', 'climax', 'filmed', 'complex', 'fuhrer-bunker-like', 'tunnels', 'actually', 'abandoned', 'sanitarium', 'night', 'establishing', 'shot', 'just', 'one', 'tiny', 'brick', 'building', 'where', 'tunnel', 'maze', 'came', 'never', 'explained.Anyway', 'star', 'film', 'only', 'good', 'reason', 'watch', 'Caitlin', ""O'Heaney"", 'remember', 'Snow', 'White', 'Charming', 'better', 'suited', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'horror', ""O'Heaney"", 'smart', 'beautiful', 'fine', 'role', 'Dana', 'Barron', 'remember', 'Audrey', 'Griswald', 'Wally', 'World', 'Caitlin', 'little', 'sister', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'minor', 'role', 'jogging', 'college', 'student', 'Paul', 'Gleason', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'minor', 'role', 'most', 'puzzling', 'element', 'film', 'tribute', 'Hitchcock', 'shower', 'scene', 'Not', 'girl', 'never', 'actually', 'attacked', 'shower', 'instead', 'nude', 'Caitlin', 'something', 'would', 'want', 'see', 'show', 'nude', 'Elizabeth', 'Kemp', 'something', 'wish', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'must', 'purge', 'image', 'slug-like', 'body', 'memory', 'are', 'few', 'original', 'elements', 'film', 'most', 'are', 'teases', 'setting', 'stage', 'standard', 'horror', 'moment', 'then', 'not', 'pulling', 'trigger', 'have', 'clever', 'twist', 'end', 'can', 'guess', 'have', 'been', 'paying', 'attention', 'not', 'just', 'few', 'seconds']",He Knows You're Alone VHS

I only recently saw it for the first time and I can't believe I actually wound up sitting through the whole thing. I can honestly saw that I have NEVER been as bored while watching a ""slasher"" flick as I was while viewing this.I have to say that the WORST aspect of this film would be the killer. I am not SPOILING anything in saying that the killer has no mask or hidden identity in this movie. We see his face right off the bat as he kills his first bride-to-be. The fact that the killer's face is fully in view during his slashings is a total bore. I actually kept thinking they cast the actor for his slightly Michael Myer's-ish facial features and wide eyes. He actually kind of looked like an uncle of mine, which made me laugh. He was totally NOT scary.The ""killings"" are REALLY REALLY REALLY bad. There is no gore and hardly any blood at all. Gore-hounds would HATE this movie for that fact alone.The main heroine is a Susan Sarandon look-a-like who annoyed me throughout the whole movie. For a film made in the 80's I was surprised at how un-liberated her character was. She is getting married to a guy she barely likes as if she has no choice, and even mentions how she is going to have to deal with the fact that her fiance told her he doesn't want her to work once they are married. As if she has no right to do what she pleases. That irritated me. Also, what was up with her STRANGE relationship with her ex-boyfriend/mortician. Her behavior was excruciatingly odd to me. What engaged woman would flirt and consider starting  up a relationship with an ex 2 weeks before her wedding??? WEIRD.Bottom line: The characters were REALLY bad.The film also blatantly copies Halloween in tons of spots. I couldn't believe some of the scenes! I was like, ""That is almost the SAME shot down to a tee!"" at certain points. I do NOT like copy-cats!!! ahhhh!!Anyways, I just had to write a review to say how bad I thought this film was.

Though I wouldn't say the movie is lousy by any means, I actually wish it would have been a bit more on the bloody side, coz as it is, it's too close to Halloween for comfort at times....and not done as well.A psycho who got the green weenie on his wedding day decides to kill his bride and then go around killing any other bride-to-be he can get his hands on.  His sights are set on the cute, yet naive and kinda loopy Caitlin O'Heaney(I'd always remembered her as the hot english teacher in Three O'Clock High). She's set to marry a guy she doesn't particularly want to marry, though it's never really explained why she seems almost forced to go through with it.  Maybe she just can't say ""no""(my kind of woman).  Aside from being stalked and tormented by the killer, she's also stalked and tormented by her ex boyfriend, Marvin, who's a kooky, lovable, nerdy mortician.  Caitlin seems to have no hangups about flirting like crazy with Marvin while her fiancee is away at his bachelor party.  And speaking of bachelor parties, you may already know that Tom Hanks is here in a small role as the romantic interest of Caitlin's best friend.  Don't get too excited, Hankophiles, he's not on camera too long and his role isn't very relevant, only to spout some psychobabble about why we like being scared by horror films and roller coasters.  There's also a detective with a personal vendetta hunting down the killer, along with that token authority figure jerk from every 80s film(the detention teacher from The Breakfast Club).  The killer, like the killer in Slumber Party Massacre, is shown frequently and is not hidden behind a mask, or disfigured or anything.  He doesn't speak.......but we do know his name is Ray!!All in all, this movie is just so-so in my opinion.  Aside from a silly looking severed head in a fish tank, the movie is very bloodless.

Holmes,"[0, 0]","Yeah, okay, we've heard from a half dozen other reviewers mention that this film came out on the heels of Halloween and that it was cashing in on that film's success. We know that the plot is very similar. So what! This film has that feel of the late '70s and very early '80s that can't be duplicated in modern cinema. From the hairstyles to the clothes, to the .90 cent candy at the movie theater in the opening scenes, to the plethora of '79 or '80 Fords (I guess they got a deal on them - they are everywhere), this film can, under the right circumstances, envelop the viewer and transport him/her into the era. The lighting and the grain of the film is right at home for the period, and the Staten Island locations are just right for the plot. The amusement park, bridal shop, ice cream parlor, and even the creepy old morgue that just happened to be a fallout shelter (this morgue has a massive underground system of tunnels) from the '60s are perfect for a film in this genre. The jogging scenes through the woods is suitably scary as well as the huge old house that is the main setting for quite a few of the scenes (just where were Amy's parents?). All of the main actors/actresses are wonderful in my opinion, Caitlin O'Heaney (Amy) in particular is perfect for the lead. She has that ""victim"" look almost from the getgo with her wide eyes. Amy's friends are also noteworthy, as they all commit horror film ""sins"" (sleeping with the married man, smoking dope, etc.) that lead to their demise. Interestingly, some future big name actors appear in this film, including the mentioned (from other reviews) Tom Hanks (for about 5 minutes - but manages to deliver his lines in a very convincing manner) and Paul Gleason. I also thought that James Rebhorn (Scent of a Woman, etc.) played a convincing hard up professor in this film. All in all, I recommend this film to any fans of this era as the nostalgia factor is very high.
