689466,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00005Y7DD,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[6, 6]","I was not ready for such a powerful, intelligent, and intricately detailed film.  I had read several glowing reviews for Christine Lahti's official directorial debut, but I had just assumed this would be another Hollywood schlock-fest featuring the dry humor of Albert Brooks (which I find grows on my with each new film) and Leelee Sobieski attempting to reconnect with a teenie-bopper audience.  I was wrong.  To be perfectly frank with you, I was dead wrong.  This was such a strong film that dedicated itself to developing strong characters, to giving us honest emotions, and providing us a story that is not unfamiliar in the ""real"" world that it nearly left my jaw hanging on the ground.  From the opening moments in which we are focused directly on the life of Jennifer (aka ""J"") to the unrecognizable change to following Randall (aka ""R"") My First Mister will make you laugh, make you cry, and make you realize that friendship is stronger than the clothes you wear or the amount of piercings on you face.  Through the use of Brooks' ""every man"" persona and Sobieski's attention to detail with her character, this film gives us a rare glimpse into Lahti's near-perfect film.What initially pulled me into this film was the untraditional Hollywood story that scribe Jill Franklyn unfolds before us.  I assumed, prior to watching the film that this was going to be a sexual film mocking the taboos of age in our society.  From the completely baffling byline, one could only assume that we were about to experience an early version of Thirteen, but Lahti and Franklyn do something rather unexpected.  The idea of sex is placed in front of us early in the film and prior to the climax, but it isn't the central focus.  By building this film around the premise of friendship instead of sex, Lahti creates a unique and poignant film about other cultural taboos in our society.  She eliminates the idea of sex and gives us two strong-willed characters that, perhaps in another life, may have had a sexual relationship, but now are just seeking companionship and comfort.  What brings a smile to my face with this story is the way that it is developed.  Lahti nearly teases us with the idea of a sexual story several times, but instead builds a solid foundation around friendship.  She makes us, the audience, feel as if we are meeting two friends for the first time.  By eliminating sex, she pulls us deeper within the characters allowing us to see the true ""love"" that is obviously between these visual opposites.  I use the word ""visual"" because we do not believe their connection at first because of the clothes that they wear.  Lahti uses this technique to trick us.  A Goth girl befriends Mr. Rogers?  Society would tell us that this could never happen, but the Lahti persuades us by giving us two of the strongest characters to play against each other in modern cinematic history.I realize that others would argue that there have been stronger matching in Hollywood long before Brooks and Sobieski, which I would agree of classic Hollywood, but recently (basically 80s to present) it is hard to find two actors that seem to compliment each other like a great cheese and aged red wine.  Brooks and Sobieski took me away from them, as the actors, and gave me a whole new viewing experience.  Sobieski dove, head first, into her character giving ""J"" mannerisms and characteristics that seemed pure and researched.  I felt as if Sobieski was one of those misunderstood Goths that I had class with in school.  From the poetry, the eye movements when speaking, and the overall self-abusive negativity that she has against herself as well as those around her.  She patiently waits for the right person to enter her insane life and finds that with Brooks.  For those seeking his typical sarcasm and wry attitude, My First Mister may disappoint.  Albert Brooks contains himself in this film.  He does so to the point that midway through the feature I forgot that it was funnyman Brooks.  He amazingly transforms himself into an older version, in a khaki color, of ""J"".  Odd to say, but that is why these two ""opposites"" attracted so well.  The two play so well off each other that as an audience member you have the chance to enjoy both the acting as well as a very strongly developed story about family and friendship.I have talked about the story, I have talked about the characters, but none of this would have been possible if it were not for the brilliant direction behind the camera and the talented eye of minimal director Christine Lahti.  At first I was unsure of how well she would be able to handle such a deeply emotional topic, if she would clich? the characters and fill their mouths with remedial dialogue that would be painful to both the eyes and ears, but instead she remained calm, cool, and completely collective throughout the entire film.  It was obvious that she had done her homework prior to each scene and before each take.  She had the control of her actors, which developed into some great on-screen chemistry, as well as she knew how to tactfully take us to the next emotional level.  Sure, it wasn't perfect (the ending seemed a bit tattered), but Lahti remained focused and even cleverly changed the focus throughout the film with the greatest of ease.  We began with ""J"", moved to ""R"", and went back to ""J"" for the final tearful moments.  Other directors would have had our minds in a fix, but Lahti was delicate and truthful to the foundation that she had just set.  I was surprised to see that Lahti has not directed more after this project, because it was obvious that her talent was behind the camera (as well as in front).Overall, I thought My First Mister was a sensational film.  This was the epitome of the ""diamond in the rough"" cinema.  We had a superb cast that complimented each other so well that we could easily forget that we were watching a film.  We had a story that spoke emotionally and socially about friendship and family on more than just a ""June Cleaver"" level.  Finally, we had a director that was not afraid to take risks and do her homework.  This story works on so many levels that to begin to unravel it would take more time than allowed.  I suggest this film strongly because it will make you think twice about passing judgment on someone due to their clothes or piercing habits, who knows where friendship could erupt!Grade: **** out of

His is a hard act to follow.Almost every critic seemed to hone in on the last third of the movie, and I thought that their almost-rabid reaction was overdone ---the sequence of events was surely undeserving of this kind of intense dislike.I thought this was a very well-done movie, sweet, gentle, fairly uncomplicated. The casting was excellent and the portrayals of an insecure teen Goth, an emotionally repressed clothing salesman, a ditzy and clueless mother, a hippie father, and an uninvolved step-father were right on the mark. The main characters were fully fleshed out and the unlikely friendship between the two vulnerable loners, J and R, was touchingly rendered.Despite their age and lifestyle differences, the two have much in common and discover this as the movie progresses and they discover that they need each other.

689469,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00005Y7DD,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","My First Mister is a film about a 17-year old goth girl played by Leelee Sobieski who develops a strong (and touching) friendship with Al Brooks' character.Her life is apparently crappy (well not really, but according to her it is) because she has no friends and feels like a total outsider.As soon as she gets a job at a clothing store, the friendship she develops with Al Brooks' character can best be described as humorous, adorable and interesting.  At first the two of them hate each other because they're so radically different personality-wise, but then things change as they get to know each other better.Without spoiling too much, the storyline eventually shifts into a different direction where we find out about Al Brooks' son, and at this point My First Mister (for me, at least) becomes a bit boring since the amount of actual laughs stop becoming so frequent, and the storyline turns very serious.  This happens about 60% of the way through.I especially like how Leelee Sobieski's mom has a personality that is TOTALLY different from her daughters, haha.  The mom is very perky and excited all the time, and some very funny moments take place such as when the daughter tries getting her mom to listen to rap.Overall, don't expect the best storyline imaginable- instead just expect a quality and simple storyline involving a friendship between a young girl and an older man.",4,a cute innocent story,1284163200,"09 11, 2010",2010,1387,"['First', 'Mister', 'film', '17-year', 'old', 'goth', 'girl', 'played', 'Leelee', 'Sobieski', 'who', 'strong', 'touching', 'friendship', 'Al', 'Brooks', 'character.Her', 'life', 'apparently', 'crappy', 'well', 'not', 'really', 'according', 'friends', 'feels', 'total', 'outsider.As', 'soon', 'job', 'clothing', 'store', 'friendship', 'Al', 'Brooks', 'character', 'can', 'best', 'be', 'described', 'humorous', 'adorable', 'interesting', 'first', 'two', 'hate', 'other', ""'re"", 'so', 'radically', 'different', 'personality-wise', 'then', 'things', 'change', 'get', 'know', 'other', 'better.Without', 'spoiling', 'too', 'much', 'storyline', 'eventually', 'different', 'direction', 'where', 'find', 'out', 'Al', 'Brooks', 'son', 'point', 'My', 'First', 'Mister', 'least', 'bit', 'boring', 'amount', 'actual', 'laughs', 'stop', 'becoming', 'so', 'frequent', 'storyline', 'very', 'serious', '60', '%', 'way', 'especially', 'like', 'how', 'Leelee', 'Sobieski', 'mom', 'personality', 'TOTALLY', 'different', 'daughters', 'haha', 'mom', 'very', 'perky', 'excited', 'time', 'very', 'funny', 'moments', 'take', 'place', 'such', 'when', 'daughter', 'getting', 'mom', 'listen', 'rap.Overall', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'best', 'storyline', 'imaginable-', 'instead', 'just', 'expect', 'quality', 'simple', 'storyline', 'involving', 'friendship', 'young', 'girl', 'older', 'man']",My First Mister

Goth girl and uptight clothing salesman make a gentle connection that proves enlightening and life-affirming for both of them. Directed to great effect by Christine Lahti, this is a film that could've been a sweetly sickening confection. Instead, its potentially saccharine moments are salvaged by surprising nuggets of truth and humor. We have the privilege of watching these two characters grow and evolve into finer versions of themselves. Ably assisted by Carol Kane (as J's ditzy but good-hearted mother) and Michael McKean (one of the exceptionally versatile regulars on the great Tracy Ullman show) in a toupee that's so terrible it deserves a special award.

So defy them and go see this touching gem of a tragicomedy.A lotta g's there.  Anyway,  the movie starts like this; Jay (as in Jennifer, played by Leelee Sobieski) is a self-centered Goth teen, perceptive in some ways, naive in others; you know, typical teenager.  Graduating from school, she needs a job to get her own place, and comes across Randall, a straightlaced but rather kind men's clothing store manager (Albert Brooks), who gives her a job.The movie goes from there.  I won't bother to describe the plot any further because A) it'd blow way too many jokes and B) it's not what you call stunningly original, which would matter if this weren't a character piece.  However, this movie isn't about what happens to Jay and &quot;R&quot;, as Jay dubs him, but how they cause and react to the events in it.The relationship is a bit more complicated than friendship; Jay becomes sexually interested in Randall, which some people have found pretty hard to swallow, or have used to dismiss this as another &quot;middle-aged guy wows young girl&quot; movie, a case of boomer ego.  Lay your fears to rest; this is a movie about a man and a girl entering a father-daughter relationship, not &quot;Autumn in New York.&quot;  I really feel sorry for people who got SO caught up in this aspect of the film that they missed its humor, or its heart.Don't think, however, that just because this movie is touching, it's afraid of going for a belly laugh.  The window dressing alone is worth the price of admission.  I can't emphasize this enough, this movie is FUNNY!The acting is great; Brooks and Sobieski, whether dealing with anger or trading one-liners, have sensational chemistry.  Carol Kane delivers an excellent character performance as Jay's hyper-perky mother, and Michael McKean is a riot as Jay's...imperceptive stepfather.  John Goodman has basically a cameo as Jay's hippie father, and he's funny, as always.Then there's Christine Lahti's direction.  The movie is told from Jay's viewpoint, and at the start, it's gently surreal, with good use made of computer special effects.  Lahti handles this with considerable sensitivity, not neglecting the visual aspects in favor of the actors.  She does quite a good job.This is a movie infused with warmth, heart, and bittersweetness.  It's good for a laugh, and good for a cry, and I heartily recommend it if you want either or both.",5,A wonderful little film,1004140800,"10 27, 2001",2001,2544,"['been', 'unjustly', 'trashed', 'probably', 'earnest', 'warm', 'gentle', 'something', 'not', 'usually', 'valued', 'ex-film-students', 'who', 'run', 'indie', 'world', 'defy', 'go', 'see', 'touching', 'gem', 'tragicomedy.A', 'lotta', 'g', 'there', 'Anyway', 'movie', 'Jay', 'Jennifer', 'played', 'Leelee', 'Sobieski', 'self-centered', 'Goth', 'teen', 'perceptive', 'ways', 'naive', 'others', 'know', 'typical', 'teenager', 'Graduating', 'school', 'job', 'get', 'own', 'place', 'Randall', 'straightlaced', 'rather', 'kind', 'men', 'clothing', 'store', 'manager', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'who', 'job.The', 'movie', 'there', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bother', 'describe', 'plot', 'further', 'A', ""'d"", 'blow', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'jokes', 'B', 'not', 'what', 'call', 'stunningly', 'original', 'would', 'matter', 'were', ""n't"", 'character', 'piece', 'However', 'movie', ""n't"", 'what', 'Jay', 'quot', 'R', 'quot', 'Jay', 'how', 'cause', 'react', 'events', 'it.The', 'relationship', 'bit', 'more', 'complicated', 'friendship', 'Jay', 'sexually', 'interested', 'Randall', 'people', 'have', 'found', 'pretty', 'hard', 'swallow', 'have', 'used', 'dismiss', 'quot', 'middle-aged', 'guy', 'wows', 'young', 'girl', 'quot', 'movie', 'case', 'boomer', 'ego', 'Lay', 'fears', 'rest', 'movie', 'man', 'girl', 'entering', 'father-daughter', 'relationship', 'not', 'quot', 'Autumn', 'New', 'York.', 'quot', 'really', 'feel', 'sorry', 'people', 'who', 'got', 'SO', 'caught', 'up', 'aspect', 'film', 'missed', 'humor', 'heart.Do', ""n't"", 'think', 'however', 'just', 'movie', 'touching', 'afraid', 'going', 'belly', 'laugh', 'window', 'dressing', 'alone', 'price', 'admission', 'ca', ""n't"", 'emphasize', 'enough', 'movie', 'FUNNY', 'acting', 'great', 'Brooks', 'Sobieski', 'dealing', 'anger', 'trading', 'one-liners', 'have', 'sensational', 'chemistry', 'Carol', 'Kane', 'excellent', 'character', 'performance', 'Jay', 'hyper-perky', 'mother', 'Michael', 'McKean', 'riot', 'Jay', 'imperceptive', 'stepfather', 'John', 'Goodman', 'basically', 'cameo', 'Jay', 'hippie', 'father', 'funny', 'always.Then', 'Christine', 'Lahti', 'direction', 'movie', 'told', 'Jay', 'viewpoint', 'start', 'gently', 'surreal', 'good', 'use', 'made', 'computer', 'special', 'effects', 'Lahti', 'considerable', 'sensitivity', 'not', 'neglecting', 'visual', 'aspects', 'favor', 'actors', 'quite', 'good', 'job.This', 'movie', 'infused', 'warmth', 'heart', 'bittersweetness', 'good', 'laugh', 'good', 'cry', 'heartily', 'recommend', 'want']",My First Mister

689480,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B00005Y7DD,Joseph Haschka,"[3, 9]","Seventeen year-old Jennifer (Leelee Sobieski) is a parent's worst nightmare. She dresses in black leather, is obsessed with the linked themes of pain and death, locks herself in her room to listen to music of the Acid Reflux genre, is disinterested in school, sports large (albeit fake) tattoos, and has had her faced multiple pierced by shiny metal studs (nose, eyebrows, lips). Her chief hobby is writing tortured self-eulogies. Her distracted mother (Carol Kane), completely alienated, is not so much unaware of her daughter's condition as left feeling completely helpless in the face of it. Jennfer's stepfather spends his time watching TV game shows. Welcome to a typical Southern California family unit as imagined by small town residents of the Midwest.Enter Randall (Albert Brooks), the forty-nine year-old, divorced, and supremely square manager of an upscale clothing store in Beverly Hills that reluctantly offers Jennifer a job as a stock clerk if only she'll remove the hardware from her face so she won't scare away the trade. Things progress from there, and the two are soon on a first initial basis, ""J"" and ""R"" respectively. And ""J"" is out front, conservatively wardrobed, selling. Mom is thrilled.Sobieski is actually quite good in her role, and one hopes she'll find better material. She effectively portrays Jennifer as a young woman adrift without an anchoring father figure. It's certainly not her stepfather, a Complete Zero who should have been eliminated from the plot entirely, nor is it any male teacher or her biological father Ben, the latter an aging hippie played by John Goodman. Randall fits the bill, though he himself is a loner who's unable to establish relationships because of a little problem that eventually reveals itself. If the scriptwriters had left it at that, it might have been fine. But then they also try and ameliorate the dysfunction that exists between Jennifer and Mom, between Randall and his ex, between Jennifer and Ben, and between Randall and any woman his own age. By the time ""J"" is offering a toast to the ""F"" words (Friends, Family, Fate, Forgiveness, Forever) at a family dinner, and a tuxedoed ""R"" is dancing with her while dragging along an IV pole, the viewer is almost smothered in the ambient warm fuzziness of it all. And Jennifer's last scene with Randall's long-lost son (What, that too?!) was so corny I was almost moved to tears.About forty-five minutes into MY FIRST MISTER, the direction the film seemed to be heading reminded me of BREEZY, that forgettable but straight forward 1973 movie starring Bill Holden as a fifty year-old divorc&eacute; who has an affair with a seventeen year-old free spirit played by Kay Lenz. The good news is that MY FIRST MISTER veered off from going there. The bad news is that it didn't continue straight on.

Leelee Sobieski plays against her blonde and generally beautiful stereotype in this film, appearing as a rather dark and depressed 17 year old teen (nicknamed J), complete with tattoos, black makeup and pierced skin.  She is miserable at school, doesn't feel understood by her mother (Carol Kane in one of her best roles), stepfather or father. She has no friends. In short, she is alienated, desperately in need of someone she can relate to.That someone turns out to be the last person you'd expect, a 49 year old men's clothing store owner named Randall (played by Albert Brooks). Although he is reluctant to hire her, he eventually gives in and the two become friends after a shakey start. Not that it is all smooth going. The two are so different that there's bound to be a few rough patches in their friendship, some occasions where they test one another (I don't want to give details for fear of spoiling the surprises).Luckily this doesn't turn into another ""older guy, younger girl"" romance. Director Christine Lahti is too smart to things get so stereotypical - thank goodness. And she is also wise enough to let viewers discover the hidden depths in Randall and J, depths that might not surface if sex muddied the waters. Lahti also adds the special touches that make this movie a standout - humorous bits, personal details and an understated style that charms without being overwhelming.

689484,A3MLO4GAD2O9DL,B00005Y7DD,"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy""","[5, 8]","With superior performances by Leelee Sobieski and Albert Brooks as the two leads, this should have been a much better film than it is.  Carol Kane as well turns in a terrific performance as an overly middle class-ified Mom--bourgeois to the max--and John Goodman, in a smallish role, is very funny as a way overgrown hippie.The first half of this film is absolutely perfect.  The comedy is witty, sharp, and simultaneously touching.  As &quot;J&quot; (for Jennifer), Sobieski really shines; she's a Goth-obsessed teen who, true to the Goth spirit, writes eulogies and haunts graveyards. One might think this sounds much too trite, but the dialogue (and J's monologues) are very smart and lift this portrayal far above the cliched.  When J meets Randall (Brooks)--her polar opposite--the inspired mix of antagonism and curiosity is brilliantly done.  He becomes her ultra conservative boss in an equally conservative clothing store where she's the backroom clerk responsible for keeping stuff in order. Told never to venture out onto the floor, she does so anyway and typically scares away the customers with her purple-dyed hair and single nose ring (this, after shedding the other four or five facial piercings at Brooks' prompting).So far, so good (in fact, really good).  Then the entire course of the film changes with the revelation of Brooks' true condition and we are faced with yet another Hollywood film meant to teach us the value of life and the true nature of us all and the importance of humanity and there's a lesson to be learned here for everyone, fellow earthlings.  Of course there is.With such great characters, as revealed by the first half of the film, why not expand upon that foundation and go for the gusto?  Move the characters into situations that sharpen their differences more and bring them together based on those differences.  By introducing an enormous element of bathos, the momentum of the first half is shattered, to be replaced by an extremely forced convergence of souls rather than a natural one that could easily have been developed, given the intelligence shown earlier in the film.The three stars are for the excellent performances and the great first half of the film.",3,Bathos supreme,1026432000,"07 12, 2002",2002,2210,"['superior', 'performances', 'Leelee', 'Sobieski', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'two', 'leads', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'Carol', 'Kane', 'as', 'well', 'terrific', 'performance', 'overly', 'middle', 'class-ified', 'Mom', 'bourgeois', 'max', 'John', 'Goodman', 'smallish', 'role', 'very', 'funny', 'way', 'hippie.The', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'comedy', 'witty', 'sharp', 'simultaneously', 'touching', 'quot', 'J', 'quot', 'Jennifer', 'Sobieski', 'really', 'Goth-obsessed', 'teen', 'who', 'true', 'Goth', 'spirit', 'eulogies', 'haunts', 'graveyards', 'One', 'might', 'think', 'much', 'too', 'trite', 'dialogue', 'J', 'monologues', 'are', 'very', 'smart', 'lift', 'portrayal', 'far', 'cliched', 'When', 'J', 'Randall', 'Brooks', 'polar', 'opposite', 'inspired', 'mix', 'antagonism', 'curiosity', 'brilliantly', 'done', 'ultra', 'conservative', 'boss', 'equally', 'conservative', 'clothing', 'store', 'where', 'backroom', 'clerk', 'responsible', 'keeping', 'stuff', 'order', 'Told', 'never', 'venture', 'out', 'floor', 'so', 'anyway', 'typically', 'away', 'customers', 'purple-dyed', 'hair', 'single', 'nose', 'ring', 'shedding', 'other', 'four', 'five', 'facial', 'piercings', 'Brooks', 'prompting', '.So', 'far', 'so', 'good', 'fact', 'really', 'good', 'Then', 'entire', 'course', 'film', 'changes', 'revelation', 'Brooks', 'true', 'condition', 'are', 'faced', 'yet', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'meant', 'teach', 'value', 'life', 'true', 'nature', 'importance', 'humanity', 'lesson', 'be', 'learned', 'here', 'everyone', 'fellow', 'earthlings', 'course', 'is.With', 'such', 'great', 'characters', 'revealed', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'why', 'not', 'expand', 'foundation', 'go', 'gusto', 'Move', 'characters', 'situations', 'sharpen', 'differences', 'more', 'bring', 'together', 'based', 'differences', 'introducing', 'enormous', 'element', 'bathos', 'momentum', 'first', 'half', 'shattered', 'be', 'replaced', 'extremely', 'forced', 'convergence', 'souls', 'rather', 'natural', 'one', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'developed', 'given', 'intelligence', 'shown', 'earlier', 'film.The', 'three', 'stars', 'are', 'excellent', 'performances', 'great', 'first', 'half', 'film']",My First Mister

I think the movie is trying to show how people can break down their defenses and connect. It shows this happening between the young and the old. It is done in an amusing yet sadly touching way. I haven't seen this theme played on and find it to be highly original. This film touches on how to forgive and let go, learning to be intimate and accepting others as they are. I throughly enjoyed the acting and the direction. Lahti knows how to show rich colors with creativity. I really loved J's bedroom and her manner of dress. The only flaw was the movie went to fast, it had to many things to say and might have been better not as cluttered, a bit simpler. I just felt like the ending went too fast as compared to the slower pace of the beginning which was nicely paced as it developed J's relationship to R. Overall, a must see!

Her bedroom would make The Addams Family proud. Plastic skeletons hang from the mirror, black and silver skull murals adorn the wardrobe, decapitated girly toy dolls stabbed with safety pins and needles sit beside naked shop mannequins covered in black eyeliner and blood. This is the kind of doom-filled bedroom &#34;Game of Thrones&#34; set designers would wander around looking for good ideas.Jay is miserable to a degree that is hilarious and pathological (the lovely and talented Leelee Sobieski). She's alienated everyone at school with how she acts and looks (tattoos, piercings, hoodies, everything in black), hasn't had a boyfriend, her mother's a hyperactive re-married wreck and her wig-wearing step-father seems absent to the world from the waist up (fabulous work by Carol Kane and Michael McKean). Jay looks at people through binoculars - backwards - because they seem more fun that way. She also enjoys lying on graves feeling the 'energy' of women who have passed and sees her beloved dead grandmother sat opposite her at the dinner table as mother serves up yet more leftover Brisket. Jay throws a paper-glider from her bedroom window each day to the uncaring World outside with her latest eulogy statement. She even self-inflicts on her arms when she's in real pain. You could say the young Californian lady has her 'issues'...One day Jay heads into where the real money is at - the Century City shopping mall in Los Angeles. Having been chucked out of every clothing store for looking like Edward Scissorhands on a Goth tip and scaring the Bejayzuss out of the customers - she ends up outside a high end clothing store called Rutherfords. Inside she sees the cardigan wearing, oversized-slacks owning Randall unsuccessfully trying to dress an armless female mannequin in the store window. For some reason Jay takes a shine to this slightly odd and sad man. However it turns out Randall Harris is not such a drip - he's witty, just as quick with the retort and although he's a guarded soul too - Randall is older, wiser and somehow more kindly (a fantastically effecting Albert Brooks).So in a moment of olive branch and spurred on by her obvious intelligence and initiative - Manager Randall offers the crazy-looking brat a storeroom job colour-coding the men's shirts. It isn't long before Randall's goodness starts to rid her of those dark-world trappings and from underneath all that black make-up emerges something pretty - even loveable and fun. Soon they're hanging out, visiting her drinking haunts, having laughs, playing records in stores and both slowly opening up to a world of possibilities that isn't so isolated and alone anymore. They may even be slightly in love, as she gets jealous of older women and their attention to Randall. Jay even hooks up with her pot-smoking freewheeling Dad again (typically funny and great work from John Goodman) and things seem good for a while...A relationship between a pretty seventeen year-old and a rotund 49 year-old male with a moustache, curly hair and no dress sense might descend into farce and even become pervy - or simply be on screen for the sake of audience shock value. But long-time Actress and Director Christine Lahti is careful to keep their time together on an even keel. But better than that - there's a genuine chemistry of affection between actors Sobieski and Brooks that fills every scene with a tenderness and admiration that is rare. These are two lost souls helping each other come out of their darkness and loneliness - and each scene they're together in bristles with that lovely hopefulness that probably made the Director want to make the movie in the first place.The burgeoning love between them is never consummated (not that kind of tale) but Jay soon discovers that Randall Harris is keeping a secret about a wife that left decades back, a son he never knew and a medical condition he's kept hidden from everyone (the woman who visits at the shop is a nurse - Mary Kay Place as Patty). And on it goes to Jay desperately trying to get back to a hospital in time with a young man in tow (Desmond Harrington) who is just as moody and morose as she is...I loved Christine Lahti in &#34;Housekeeping&#34; (a 1987 film that's long forgotten and criminally so) and I figured her &#34;My First Mister&#34; would be touching - and it is. &#34;You communicate with articles not humans...&#34; Jay says to neurotic Randall in a probing moment. She honestly calls him &#34;anal dude&#34; in another and he doesn't mind because deep down he knows she's right. He jokes back in the early part of their relationship &#34;We'll keep her in the store on a temporary basis in case she tries suicide!&#34; - while he later confesses on his home porch &#34;I'm afraid of everything...going to bed...waking up...&#34; Astutely and beautifully observed by Jill Franklyn (the Writer) - there's a dance of truth and expression between the two lead characters that is both profound and warm and not easy to get right.Perhaps because of its slightly naff title this 2001 film never seemed to get noticed - and to this day (2014) the HD version is only available on a download (there's no BLU RAY). But this is one little tattoo on the buttocks I suggest you get down and dirty with...A tender and life-affirming movie - maybe one day &#34;My First Mister&#34; will make it onto the new format.

689491,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00005Y7DD,Reviewer,"[32, 33]","Among the many and myriad young actresses making movies today, there has unequivocally emerged a Fantastic Four, and they are:  Natalie Portman, Anna Paquin, Kirsten Dunst and Leelee Sobieski.  And the one who is arguably the leader of the pack, Leelee Sobieski, takes on the starring role here, in ""My First Mister,"" a story of two very different people, of different generations, both of whom are alone in the world (though in different ways and for different reasons), and who ultimately find what they need in one another-- and without even consciously looking for it.  Directed by Christine Lahti, It's a study, not only of human nature, but of the expansiveness and resiliency of the human spirit and of the heart, and how it is possible for two people to defy category and definition, and intuitively reach out to one another by allowing fate, or destiny-- or whatever you want to call it-- to take them beyond the parameters set by society, where-- as in this case-- they are able to find fulfillment in it's purest sense.  It's a revised chapter taken from the age-old book of The Human Comedy, updated to a contemporary setting to illustrate that now as much as ever, no man is an island; that everyone needs someone, that there is someone for everyone and, moreover, that one will instinctively seek out that kindred soul, often finding him in the most unlikely of places.Jennifer (Sobieski) is an unhappy teen; she's adopted a goth look and lifestyle, embraces her autonomy, but in so doing has alienated just about everybody around her, including-- or perhaps especially-- her immediate family.  she simply cannot relate to her mother, Sylvie (Carol Kane), who seems perpetually mired in the `50s (her appearance and attitude part of her own defense mechanisms and survival tactics), or her step-father, Bob (Michael McKean), a nondescript individual who is just...there.What Jennifer longs for is a place of her own, which she equates (albeit subconsciously) to independence, and toward that end she begins looking for the gainful employment that will enable her to achieve her immediate goal.  And it is during her job search that she encounters Randall (Albert Brooks), the manager of a men's clothing store.Necessity may be the proverbial mother of invention, but here it becomes the driving force that makes the connection between two people who-- if not for that necessity-- would never have known the other existed.  As it turns out, however, due to some quite personal circumstances and reasons of his own, Randall is something of a singular individual, and is able to see beyond Jennifer's outward appearance and attitude, and agrees to give her a job on a trial basis.  And it's the beginning of a unique relationship that will ultimately change both of their lives forever, and in ways that neither of them could possibly have imagined.This is the first feature film that Lahti-- a fine actor herself-- has directed, and she does an exemplary job with it.  She knows her characters and the emotional terrain with which she is dealing, and subtly fills the story as it unfolds with pathos and poignancy, which she delivers with care and sensitivity.  Lahti has an eye for emotional detail and, perhaps due to her own extensive acting background, knows how to extract the precise sentiment she's endeavoring to express from her actors.  And because of the way it's presented, when the story takes an unexpected turn, the transition is so seamless it comes across as entirely real and convincing, which of course gives it credibility, and makes it believable.  Lahti has a gentle touch tempered with a restraint, and it gives her film a natural flow and a rhythm that draws in the viewer and makes for a satisfying and involving experience.Complementing Lahti's style, and assuring the success of this film, are the wonderful performances by Sobieski and Brooks.  Sobieski runs an emotional gamut in this film, and she does it with a poise and maturity beyond her years, making her journey from disenfranchised goth at the beginning of the film, to the individual she is at the end, plausible and convincing.  She manages to convey all of the emotional layers of her character, which enables the viewer to relate to the complexities of who this young woman is and what she's feeling, which-- since this is a character driven story-- is integral to the overall success of the film.  And Sobieski makes it so, with a memorable performance.A big part of the credit for the film's success has to go to Albert Brooks, as well.  As he does here with Randall, Brooks has an innate ability to create a character that is so normal, so average-guy-on-the-street, that it adds that total sense of reality to the film.  It's the little things that Brooks does so well, and that make all the difference; he gives the audience someone with whom they can truly empathize and identify, because he so succinctly manages to express all the affecting elements of everyday life-- the minutiae of day-to-day existence, as well as the corresponding emotions-- through his characters, and it's why you're going to remember Randall for a long, long time.  Like Ben Stiller, Brooks has a straightforward, often wry delivery that works so well, and which he uses to great effect.  And it certainly serves him well here.The supporting cast includes Desmond Harrington (Randy), Mary Kay Place (Patty), Kevin Cooney (Doctor), William Forward (Customer) and Lisa Jane Persky (Sheila).  An entertaining, well crafted and delivered film that promises one thing and ends up giving much more, ""My First Mister,"" in the final analysis, is an engaging story that goes deep and touches the heart, and without any maudlin sentimentality attached.  Ultimately a transporting experience, this is one that will take you to a place you'll want to be, and you'll be glad you took the journey.  And that's the magic of the movies.",5,Affecting Performances by Sobieski and Brooks,1020038400,"04 29, 2002",2002,5907,"['many', 'myriad', 'young', 'actresses', 'making', 'movies', 'today',

689496,A19N3GRTJ0S8J8,B00005Y7DD,"Virginia Lore ""rumtussle""","[7, 7]","Christine Lahti hits her directorial stride with My First Mister, the story of goth chick J's precarious friendship with her wry middle-aged retail boss Randall.  Proving the old adage that cliches are cliches because they're true, Lahti guides Leelee Sobieski (think Drew Barrymore's geeky math team friend in Never Been Kissed) and Albert Brooks (Taxi Driver, Defending Your Life) through Jill Franklyn's warm comedy that misses sappiness through its edginess and wit. &quot;I like chocolate.  It's dark and warm, like I imagine a hug would be&quot; is just one of the lines written by Franklyn, who has contributed several scripts to the Seinfeld show.J's perspective, like that of Winona Ryder's Roxy in the '80's movie Welcome Home Roxy Carmicheal, is dark and miserably self-centered but enormously entertaining.  Her chemistry with Randall requires no suspension of disbelief--Brooks and Sobieski have just made my list of Top Ten Most Watchable Onscreen Couples.  The movie's set up is absorbing, and the somewhat formulaic rise of action doesn't deter from its entertainment value as the last third of the movie veers from the predictable and into the deeply satisfying.  Cameos by Mary Kay Place, Micheal McKean, Carol Kane and John Goodman add color to the screen as well.In short, an excellent movie and well worth your time.",5,"Welcome Home, Christine Lahti",1026518400,"07 13, 2002",2002,1337,"['Christine', 'Lahti', 'directorial', 'stride', 'My', 'First', 'Mister', 'story', 'goth', 'chick', 'J', 'precarious', 'friendship', 'wry', 'middle-aged', 'retail', 'boss', 'Randall', 'Proving', 'old', 'adage', 'cliches', 'are', 'cliches', ""'re"", 'true', 'Lahti', 'Leelee', 'Sobieski', 'think', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'geeky', 'math', 'team', 'friend', 'Never', 'Been', 'Kissed', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'Defending', 'Life', 'Jill', 'Franklyn', 'warm', 'comedy', 'sappiness', 'edginess', 'wit', 'quot', 'like', 'chocolate', 'dark', 'warm', 'imagine', 'hug', 'would', 'be', 'quot', 'just', 'one', 'lines', 'written', 'Franklyn', 'who', 'contributed', 'several', 'scripts', 'Seinfeld', 'show.J', 'perspective', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'Roxy', ""'80"", 'movie', 'Welcome', 'Home', 'Roxy', 'Carmicheal', 'dark', 'miserably', 'self-centered', 'enormously', 'entertaining', 'chemistry', 'Randall', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'Brooks', 'Sobieski', 'have', 'just', 'made', 'list', 'Top', 'Ten', 'Most', 'Watchable', 'Onscreen', 'Couples', 'movie', 'set', 'up', 'absorbing', 'somewhat', 'formulaic', 'rise', 'action', ""n't"", 'deter', 'entertainment', 'value', 'last', 'third', 'movie', 'veers', 'predictable', 'deeply', 'satisfying', 'Cameos', 'Mary', 'Kay', 'Place', 'Micheal', 'McKean', 'Carol', 'Kane', 'John', 'Goodman', 'add', 'color', 'screen', 'well.In', 'short', 'excellent', 'movie', 'well', 'time']",My First Mister
