This is a good but typical 80's movie with passable singing and extraordinary dancing sequences. I wish the characters could of been more indept but I  know with eight main characters it is hard to!! I wish it was a bit longer  but with most 80's movies they tend to get right to the plot I would  recommend this movie at a slumber party or if you are home alone on  fridays!!!! Im waiting for a sequel,3,Good 80's Movie!!!,938131200,"09 24, 1999",1999,470,"['Im', 'smalltown', 'outside', 'sandusky', 'ohio', 'so', 'im', 'little', 'biased', 'good', 'typical', '80', 'movie', 'passable', 'singing', 'extraordinary', 'dancing', 'sequences', 'wish', 'characters', 'could', 'been', 'more', 'indept', 'know', 'eight', 'main', 'characters', 'hard', 'wish', 'was', 'bit', 'longer', 'most', '80', 'movies', 'tend', 'get', 'right', 'plot', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'slumber', 'party', 'are', 'home', 'alone', 'fridays', 'Im', 'waiting', 'sequel']",N/A

One day, I started singing, ""Forward! Forward! Moving fast forward!"" I was thinking, what song is this and why I am randomly remembering it!? THEN I FIGURED IT OUT! I immediately played the film on Amazon, and you'd be surprised to know just how much of the plot I still remember.Fast Forward is a great story of determination and dreams.

Whenever this movie would come on HBO, my eyes would be completely agog. The film is like a warped form of escapism for me. Watching 5 kids from the streets of Sandusky rise to the top in the Big Apple is just a sight for sore eyes. I love the music in the film, it's repetitive, addictive, and Fame-esque. My favorite song is at the end during the credits called &quot;Long As We Believe.&quot; You people be sure to look out for that song because it will be a hit again. Concluding, I wouldn't recommend buying this film, but if you are ever up during the wee hours of the morning and happen to be watching cable TV, give this movie a chance!",4,I know I'm not the only one.,983923200,"03 7, 2001",2001,778,"['reason', 'unabashed', 'cheesiness', 'dated', 'quality', 'enjoy', 'film', 'so', 'innocent', 'compared', 'today', 'standards', 'Whenever', 'movie', 'would', 'come', 'HBO', 'eyes', 'would', 'be', 'completely', 'agog', 'film', 'warped', 'form', 'escapism', 'Watching', '5', 'kids', 'streets', 'Sandusky', 'rise', 'top', 'Big', 'Apple', 'just', 'sight', 'sore', 'eyes', 'love', 'music', 'film', 'repetitive', 'addictive', 'Fame-esque', 'favorite', 'song', 'end', 'credits', 'called', 'quot', 'Long', 'Believe.', 'quot', 'people', 'be', 'sure', 'look', 'out', 'song', 'will', 'be', 'hit', 'again', 'Concluding', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'buying', 'film', 'are', 'ever', 'wee', 'hours', 'morning', 'happen', 'be', 'watching', 'cable', 'TV', 'give', 'movie', 'chance']",N/A
