The instructor gives clear, complete instructions, though she does tend to yell at you at a couple of points.  You really do have to hang in there though, because some of these moves are *tough*!  For the areas that it is targeting, it is a terrific, low-impact workout that you will definitely feel. I do wish, as someone else mentioned, that it included more than just a legs and arms workout. Guess you have to buy the other Lottie Berk tapes for that. I do recommend this DVD, though it is a bit pricey.

739087,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B00008DDVQ,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[74, 75]","The Lotte Berke Method is a non-traditional type of toning developed by a dancer of the same name. It emphasizes the creation of long, lean (not bulky) muscles through the use of small, precise movements, and it has inspired similar methods such as Callanetics and The Bar Method; this particular video is very similar to TBM Designer Sculpting.In MUSCLE EATS FAT, the focus is on whole-body toning. The workout begins with a warm-up, a type of high-legged marching in place, and includes simple stretches. The first section targets the arms using light weights. The movement are similar to traditional toning (eg, bicep curls and tricep extensions) but are made unique by both the preciseness of each movement as well as the use of the ""Lotte Berk tuck,"" an isometric stance which works the legs while working the upper body. The arm section finishes on the floor with some tough plank moves which also work the buttocks.The leg work comes next; although the moves are displayed using a ballet barre, a sturdy, high-backed chair works fine. These exercises clearly derive from ballet and really target the thigh muscles. Again, the Lotte Berk tuck is used to increase the work on both the legs and the hip area. The final exercises for the lower body are done on a mat using the signature Lotte Berk movement, Knee Dancing--again, you will really FEEL this in your thighs. The workout ends with a final stretch, although in the Lotte Berk Method, stretches are also woven throughout following each strength move.The video is led by three Lotte Berk certified instructors. The main instructor, Barbara, looks amazing for her age, which she says is close to 50. She's a bit goofy in her comments (eg, repeatedly saying ""did you feel that?"" and ""I love this workout!""), but she provides good information and cuing. The remaining two instructors do not speak, but one shows modifications. The Lotte Berk Method is great for all exercisers who are looking for a different but challenging strength workout, including those at a beginning level; for full-body toning, this is a very good workout.",4,A quick but intense full-body toning workout,1110844800,"03 15, 2005",2005,2090,"['Lotte', 'Berke', 'Method', 'non-traditional', 'type', 'toning', 'developed', 'dancer', 'same', 'name', 'creation', 'long', 'lean', 'not', 'bulky', 'muscles', 'use', 'small', 'precise', 'movements', 'inspired', 'similar', 'methods', 'such', 'Callanetics', 'Bar', 'Method', 'particular', 'video', 'very', 'similar', 'TBM', 'Designer', 'Sculpting.In', 'MUSCLE', 'EATS', 'FAT', 'focus', 'whole-body', 'toning', 'workout', 'warm-up', 'type', 'high-legged', 'marching', 'place', 'simple', 'stretches', 'first', 'section', 'arms', 'using', 'light', 'weights', 'movement', 'are', 'similar', 'traditional', 'toning', 'eg', 'bicep', 'curls', 'tricep', 'extensions', 'are', 'made', 'unique', 'preciseness', 'movement', 'as', 'well', 'use', 'Lotte', 'Berk', 'tuck', 'isometric', 'stance', 'legs', 'working', 'upper', 'body', 'arm', 'section', 'finishes', 'floor', 'tough', 'plank', 'moves', 'also', 'work', 'buttocks.The', 'leg', 'work', 'next', 'moves', 'are', 'displayed', 'using', 'ballet', 'barre', 'sturdy', 'high-backed', 'chair', 'fine', 'exercises', 'clearly', 'derive', 'ballet', 'really', 'target', 'thigh', 'muscles', 'Again', 'Lotte', 'Berk', 'tuck', 'used', 'increase', 'work', 'legs', 'hip', 'area', 'final', 'exercises', 'lower', 'body', 'are', 'done', 'mat', 'using', 'signature', 'Lotte', 'Berk', 'movement', 'Knee', 'Dancing', 'again', 'will', 'really', 'FEEL', 'thighs', 'workout', 'final', 'stretch', 'Lotte', 'Berk', 'Method', 'stretches', 'are', 'also', 'woven', 'following', 'strength', 'move.The', 'video', 'led', 'three', 'Lotte', 'Berk', 'certified', 'instructors', 'main', 'instructor', 'Barbara', 'amazing', 'age', 'close', '50', 'bit', 'goofy', 'comments', 'eg', 'repeatedly', 'saying', 'did', 'feel', 'love', 'workout', 'good', 'information', 'cuing', 'remaining', 'two', 'instructors', 'do', 'not', 'speak', 'one', 'modifications', 'Lotte', 'Berk', 'Method', 'great', 'exercisers', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'different', 'challenging', 'strength', 'workout', 'including', 'beginning', 'level', 'full-body', 'toning', 'very', 'good', 'workout']",Lotte Berk Method For Beginners - Muscle Eats Fat

Each exercise is also followed by deep stretching.This video is about half an hour long, and while there are a total of four Lotte Berk Method DVDs that can also be purched as boxed set, all of the DVDs focus on either one or two areas of the body. ""Lotte Berk Method: Muscle Eats Fat"" focuses on the upper and lower body, but does not include an abdominal-only workout (even though you do engage your abs throughout the entire workout). This means that these workouts should either be combined or alternated with, unlike the two very similar Bar Method DVDs, which each offer a total body workout. As for the instructors, my feelings about them were very neutral. Sure, they do seem a bit stiff and even come off as somewhat snobbish, although their personalities do kind of compliment the workout.Overall, I think ""Muscle Eats Fat"" is a beneficial workout for beginner to intermediate exercisers, and like The Bar ""Method: Designer Sculpting"" DVD, you'll also use light dumbells for the upper body portions.

The DVD is broken into five segements.The warmup is the typical Lotte Berk warmup, with the high marching with swinging arms type step, etc.Upper Body uses light to moderate weights (I would not recommend heavy weights with this due to the movement of the rotator cuff), for bicep curls, static movements, and bringing the weights just off the thigh to above the head, while keeping the arm relatively straight.Lower body uses barwork, and a series of controlled, ballet inspired squats, both facing the bar and at an angle.Knee dancing is as it sounds--from a kneeling position, moving the hips left to right, front to back, and in a circle.Shape by Stretch is an integral part of the Lotte Berk program, and is a series of intense stretches.In the extras, is an intense bonus blast, which is a series of harder exercises based off of the ones in the previous workout, along with the ability to do the workout without narration.I like to alternate this one, Lotte Berk Hip Hugger Abs, and also Callanetics, and I really do notice a difference in the shape of my body.Please note, with the ""shape by stretch,"" these are done to decrease the amount of bulk one would get in their muscles, so if you are looking to create cuts or cording in the body, or to bulk up, these are the antithesis--they create firm, streamlined muscles, but will not give you the ""bulging biceps when my arms are at rest"" look.",5,A nice alternative to the norm,1167177600,"12 27, 2006",2006,1463,"['instructor', 'likable', 'movements', 'well', 'DVD', 'broken', 'five', 'segements.The', 'warmup', 'typical', 'Lotte', 'Berk', 'warmup', 'high', 'marching', 'swinging', 'arms', 'type', 'step', 'Body', 'light', 'moderate', 'weights', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'heavy', 'weights', 'due', 'movement', 'rotator', 'cuff', 'bicep', 'curls', 'static', 'movements', 'bringing', 'weights', 'just', 'thigh', 'above', 'head', 'keeping', 'arm', 'relatively', 'straight.Lower', 'body', 'barwork', 'series', 'controlled', 'ballet', 'inspired', 'squats', 'facing', 'bar', 'angle.Knee', 'dancing', 'kneeling', 'position', 'moving', 'hips', 'left', 'right', 'front', 'back', 'circle.Shape', 'Stretch', 'integral', 'part', 'Lotte', 'Berk', 'program', 'series', 'intense', 'stretches.In', 'extras', 'intense', 'bonus', 'blast', 'series', 'harder', 'exercises', 'based', 'ones', 'previous', 'workout', 'ability', 'do', 'workout', 'narration.I', 'alternate', 'one', 'Lotte', 'Berk', 'Hip', 'Hugger', 'Abs', 'also', 'Callanetics', 'really', 'do', 'notice', 'difference', 'shape', 'body.Please', 'note', 'shape', 'stretch', 'are', 'done', 'decrease', 'amount', 'bulk', 'one', 'would', 'get', 'muscles', 'so', 'are', 'looking', 'create', 'cuts', 'cording', 'body', 'bulk', 'up', 'are', 'antithesis', 'create', 'firm', 'streamlined', 'muscles', 'will', 'not', 'give', 'bulging', 'biceps', 'when', 'arms', 'are', 'rest', 'look']",Lotte Berk Method For Beginners - Muscle Eats Fat

Brown,"[11, 11]","MUSCLE EATS FAT is a no-nonsense, full-body workout led by Barbara Boolukos, one of four Lotte Berk instructors who appear on the four DVDs available.  Barbara is my favorite because she is in her late forties and hardly looks any older than her twenty-something counterparts.  Barbara is beautifully sculpted, strong, agile, and amazingly flexible.  She says on the tape she is nearly 50, had a bone density test that showed she ""didn't have a trace"" of osteoporosis, and has been practicing the Lotte Berk Method for 21 years.  She is a testament to what a woman in reasonably good health and without serious physical limitations can look like if she eats sensibly and consistently follows this program.  The Lotte Berk Method features 30 minute workouts that combine the best of Pilates, yoga, anaerobic resistance training, ballet moves, and physical therapy exercises.

I love to find DVDs that have challening and unique moves for toning. However, I was very disappointed with this video. I did not find it challening at all and the ""knee dancing"" segment is dangerous because it puts too much pressure on your knee caps. And also, I found the instructor to be extremely annoying.  Do not waste you money on this DVD when there are so many other great ones out there.

739100,A1109900VHA31J,B00008DDVQ,TBM Devotee,"[72, 73]","We all know who the irreverent Lotte Berk was and that she designed these deceptively simple work-outs to help herself get back into shape after a paralyzing car accident. Lydia Bach brought the Method to the U.S. where other programs were spun off (Callanetics, The Bar Method, Core Fusion, etc) These are the originals and these gals are serious about sculpting and reshaping your body. I know there are a few comments regarding snob appeal and snootiness but I honestly did not detect any of that from the instructors. They seem genuinely involved and invested in getting you to understand the Method and do it correctly. Not all of the instructors appear comfortable as background exercisers but each as the lead instructor is absolutely confident in what she's doing.So. Having babbled all that, here we go. (I do tend to compare them to The Bar Method and that instructor Burr Leonard, which is where *I* started so indulge me.)These workouts are approximately 30 minutes each and the time  flew. You are working hard right away. There is no easing in.Muscle Eats Fat is led by the most advanced instructor, Barbara. She is 49 and incredibly strong and shapely. Her waist must be 16"" honestly. Really.There were a couple of exercises you know from Bar Method and Callanetics, such as the tuck work at the barre; however, the instructor really explains what she's doing and why what you're doing is important. She also explains why the stretch after each exercise is crucial. While Burr has us gently tucking while doing the arm exercises, this chick has you intensely tucking while each time, asking you to bend your knees and lower yourself a few more inches with each set. So you are tucking, holding hard and periodically dipping a bit lower ALL THE WHILE working the arms with weights. They're light weights but by the second set, you're trembling and shaking (and taking her name in vain, lol)The only issue I had here (and what prevented me from giving her five full stars) is the commentary during the arm work. She wasn't on beat while she was counting and some of her ""encouragement"" was distracting. You grow accustomed to it and after a while it doesn't bother anymore at all. Her personality does grow on you because you can tell that she really wants you to understand what you're doing and why so that you do it properly and don't waste time. She gives more reminders than Burr and she points out where you should be feeling the work. But initially, to be honest, you just wish she'd shut up so you can scream and curse in peace.There is an exercise called The Plank (and if you do Yoga, you're already very familiar with it but in Yoga, you go down much lower and hold just an inch off the ground.) and what makes it so difficult is that you're lifting the opposite leg and raising and lowering it while keeping your abs pulled in and your weight balanced on your arms. It looks like a full-blown push-up but you're on your forearms rather than your hands. Very challenging, very tough, very effective.The knee dancing, according to the instructor, is the key to the workout. It seemed very challenging and did make me laugh, unlike Burr's knee dancing and marshmallow punching. I didn't initally like sitting on my heels and this bothered me at first but by the third set, I was pretty well stretched and it actually was kind of fun. Now (I've been doing Lotte Berk since 5.13.05) I can sit easily on my heels and I'm far more flexible now. I can do the knee dancing easily. I'm still winded and grateful for the respites but I don't think I'm going to fall over the way I did at first.The stretches, she reminds you are not for relaxation but for elongation and you do stretch each and every time. There are three instructors and one does a modification for beginners. This workout was exhausting but in a completely relaxed and gratifying way. You understand what I mean, lol. You feel as if you have worked every muscle in your body but you're strangely calmed and refreshed at the same time. Not sure how they accomplish this mind/body/spirit relaxation and serene reaction to the workout but they do it marvelously.The Bonus Blasts are kick-your-bum tough. In *all* of them, particularly this one.I've changed my body to the point at which people in my office are asking me what I'm doing.They don't want to do the work, though. People always expect a quick fix and when I explain the workout, I can see the disappointment in their eyes. BUT, if I'd known how difficult these exercises were initially, I wouldn't have done it either. But I'm glad that I didn't know because this program is outstanding. What Burr Leonard began in The Bar Method, this program finishes with a lithe and strong body. My goal is Labor Day and I know I'll be in my tiny goal size because I've already dropped to an 8 (I'm 5'9"").I wholeheartedly give it a thumbs up. BUT be warned: it's tough, it's challenging and you will work very hard. But the body you create is well worth it. I promise.",4,Get ready to get serious about reshaping,1121126400,"07 12, 2005",2005,4997,"['know', 'who', 'irreverent', 'Lotte', 'Berk', 'was', 'designed', 'deceptively', 'simple', 'work-outs',
