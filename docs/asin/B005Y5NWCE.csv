1505501,A2ZKEBPCKEHDGL,B005Y5NWCE,C McGhee,"[2, 2]","Black Butterflies, a picture of the life of Ingrid Jonker (Carice van Houten) in South Africa during the years of Apartheid is a movie that leaves many impressions. She was a poet & the daughter of a South African MP or representative of an electoral district. Born to privilege, her mother died in an asylum she herself would later be admitted to herself. She showed signs of mental illness all her life & spent many of her days self medicating with sex & alcohol. Yet her talent with words is well documented in her poems.Being in conflict with her father's political beliefs she suffered an estrangement from him even when in the same room. It is well known that daughters who fail to receive the love they need from living fathers often turn to other men for love & approval. Sex, being the mechanism they try to use to obtain that that they lacked growing up, creating unstable relationships in their adult life too. They become a burden to those around them & not the first person you'd seek as a friend. Her choices as an adult leave a lot to be desired. Even her own daughter who she chose to leave motherless was used more as a crutch than an object of love & responsibility.She lived a life of mental turmoil in a country of extreme prejudice & hated that inequality. Unable to forget or assuage the pain of her circumstances, that pain grew over the years to choke her. Yet she became the voice of those that were declared less than human by her father's beliefs. A poem of hers was read at the first democratically elected South African Congress. It begins, ""The child is not dead""She took her own life after having withstood all the pain & confusion she could in this life & that will always be controversial in this world. Who is to judge how a person that retains constant contact with mental agony so that it builds in them year by year with little or no relief is to be seen? We call those that overcome such circumstances heroes & hope we are like them. Yet those that see the inequities in this world & summarily reject such things for themselves while seeing them clear enough to describe them in verse, having those things enter their mind through their eyes on a daily basis, what can we say of them. Ingrid was a load to carry if you knew her & quite frankly I'm glad I didn't. I'm no fan of suicide either but I find more sorrow than condemnation in her passing. It is for certain that the people of a South Africa free of Apartheid see her as worthy of praise.Carice van Houten is excellent in portraying a life made of & lived by confusion. Rutger Hauer as her father & Liam Cunningham as her main love in life are strong in there roles as well. There is little in this movie that is shot as pretty or engaging scenery with the exception of the ocean. It's not intended to be pretty either in appearance or portrayal. Nudity is included but it is tastefully done. I was tempted to turn this off early on while they were displaying Ingrid's choices in life. It was a difficult watch to get through because of my dislike for her personality & life but I was glad I hung in till the end. I give it 4 out of 5 Amazon stars overall. 5 out of 5 for making me think through my reactions to it.It only rates 5.8 at imdb but I think a lot of people quit on this one & rated it anyway.",4,Dark Africa,1382572800,"10 24, 2013",2013,3301,"['Black', 'Butterflies', 'picture', 'life', 'Ingrid', 'Jonker', 'Carice', 'van', 'Houten', 'South', 'Africa', 'years', 'Apartheid', 'movie', 'many', 'impressions', 'was', 'poet', 'daughter', 'South', 'African', 'MP', 'representative', 'electoral', 'district', 'Born', 'privilege', 'mother', 'died', 'asylum', 'would', 'later', 'be', 'admitted', 'herself', 'showed', 'signs', 'mental', 'illness', 'life', 'spent', 'many', 'days', 'self', 'medicating', 'sex', 'alcohol', 'talent', 'words', 'well', 'documented', 'poems.Being', 'conflict', 'father', 'political', 'beliefs', 'suffered', 'estrangement', 'even', 'when', 'same', 'room', 'well', 'known', 'daughters', 'who', 'fail', 'receive', 'love', 'need', 'living', 'fathers', 'often', 'turn', 'other', 'men', 'love', 'approval', 'Sex', 'being', 'mechanism', 'try', 'use', 'obtain', 'lacked', 'growing', 'up', 'creating', 'unstable', 'relationships', 'adult', 'life', 'too', 'become', 'burden', 'not', 'first', 'person', ""'d"", 'seek', 'friend', 'choices', 'adult', 'leave', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'Even', 'own', 'daughter', 'who', 'chose', 'leave', 'motherless', 'was', 'used', 'more', 'crutch', 'object', 'love', 'responsibility.She', 'lived', 'life', 'mental', 'turmoil', 'country', 'extreme', 'prejudice', 'hated', 'inequality', 'Unable', 'forget', 'assuage', 'pain', 'circumstances', 'pain', 'grew', 'years', 'choke', 'became', 'voice', 'were', 'declared', 'less', 'human', 'father', 'beliefs', 'poem', 'hers', 'was', 'read', 'first', 'democratically', 'elected', 'South', 'African', 'Congress', 'child', 'not', 'dead', 'took', 'own', 'life', 'having', 'withstood', 'pain', 'confusion', 'could', 'life', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'controversial', 'world', 'Who', 'judge', 'how', 'person', 'constant', 'contact', 'mental', 'agony', 'year', 'year', 'little', 'relief', 'be', 'seen', 'call', 'overcome', 'such', 'circumstances', 'heroes', 'hope', 'are', 'see', 'inequities', 'world', 'summarily', 'reject', 'such', 'things', 'seeing', 'clear', 'enough', 'describe', 'verse', 'having', 'things', 'enter', 'mind', 'eyes', 'daily', 'basis', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'Ingrid', 'was', 'load', 'carry', 'knew', 'quite', 'frankly', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", ""'m"", 'fan', 'suicide', 'find', 'more', 'sorrow', 'condemnation', 'passing', 'certain', 'people', 'South', 'Africa', 'free', 'Apartheid', 'see', 'worthy', 'praise.Carice', 'van', 'Houten', 'excellent', 'portraying', 'life', 'made', 'lived', 'confusion', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', 'father', 'Liam', 'Cunningham', 'main', 'love', 'life', 'are', 'strong', 'roles', 'as', 'well', 'little', 'movie', 'shot', 'pretty', 'engaging', 'scenery', 'exception', 'ocean', 'not', 'intended', 'be', 'pretty', 'appearance', 'portrayal', 'Nudity', 'included', 'tastefully', 'done', 'was', 'tempted', 'turn', 'off', 'early', 'were', 'displaying', 'Ingrid', 'choices', 'life', 'was', 'difficult', 'watch', 'get', 'dislike', 'personality', 'life', 'was', 'glad', 'hung', 'till', 'end', 'give', '4', '5', 'Amazon', 'stars', 'overall', '5', '5', 'making', 'think', 'reactions', 'it.It', 'only', 'rates', '5.8', 'imdb', 'think', 'lot', 'people', 'quit', 'one', 'rated', 'anyway']",Black Butterflies [Blu-ray]

1505504,A328S9RN3U5M68,B005Y5NWCE,Grady Harp,"[3, 3]","BLACK BUTTERFLIES is a biographical drama based on the life of Ingrid Jonker. For those who are unfamiliar with this poet the following description my aid in the appreciation of this film: `Ingrid Jonker (19 September 1933 - 19 July 1965) was a South African poet. Although she wrote in Afrikaans, her poems have been widely translated into other languages. Ingrid Jonker has reached iconic status in South Africa and is often called the South African Sylvia Plath, owing to the intensity of her work and the tragic course of her turbulent life. Her work has also been compared to that of Anne Sexton.' Greg Latter has written the screenplay that attempts to give us all the facets of this enigmatic personality and the film is directed by Paula van der Oest. It is obviously an act of love.We meet Ingrid and her sister Anna as children, poor, without shoes, and taken to the home of their Apartheid father Abraham Jonker (Rutger Hauer) the Minister of Censorship for the parliament of South Africa. As Ingrid (Carice van Houten) matures she becomes a beautiful, but impetuous young poet, feeling abandoned, blaming others, promiscuous, escaping in excessive drinking too much in order to feel safe and able to cope, and becoming overwhelmed by conflicting emotions, which characterize some common personality disorders. At her father's demand she married Pieter, has a daughter by him, and leaves him because she feels trapped. While swimming in the ocean she nearly drowns but is saved by writer Jack Cope (Liam Cunningham) - this act results in a love relationship and despite Jack's decaying marriage they plan to live together. They both support the young South African poet Nkos (Thamsanqua Mbongo) and aid his escape form South Africa to Europe in hopes of finding freedom to write. Ingrid's and Jack's relationship is passionate and stormy: Ingrid has affairs simply because she has the freedom of mind to do so, and the affair with one Eugene Maritz (Nicholas Pauling), a married man, drives Jack away. Ingrid aborts the child she conceived with Jack (Jack does not know this) and eventually does the same with a child conceived with Eugene. All the while Ingrid is suffering form her inner demons but at the same time becoming more aware of the cruelty of Apartheid. Her writings reflect these feelings and are censored by her father. Yet her greatest collection of poems about the Apartheid are published despite her father's wishes and her father disowns her for being a wasted `slut.' Ingrid's increasingly bizarre behavior results in several psychiatric hospitalizations and suicide attempts and she goes to Paris where she is treated with electroconvulsive therapy. The treatment calms her but robs her of the ability to write poetry and during the night of 19 July 1965, Jonker went to the beach at Three Anchor Bay in Cape Town where she walked into the sea and committed suicide by drowning.Carice van Houten, Liam Cunningham, and Rutger Hauer offer brilliant performances and the support cast is strong - Candice D'Arcy as Ingrid's sister Anna, Grant Swanby as Jan Rabie, and Graham Clarke as Jack's closest mate Uys Krige. During the film's credits we hear Nelson Mandela reading Ingrid's prize winning poem `The Dead Child of Nyanga', probably the most important poem to influence the end of Apartheid.She searched for a home, she searched for love. Confronted by Apartheid and a father who was Minister of censorship. With men like Jack Cope and Andre Brink she found much love, but no home. In his first speech to the South African Parliament Nelson Mandela read her poem ""The Dead Child of Nyanga"" and addresses her as one of the finest poets of South Africa.The child is not deadThe child lifts his fists against his motherWho shouts Afrika ! shouts the breathOf freedom and the veldIn the locations of the cordoned heartThe child lifts his fists against his fatherin the march of the generationswho shouts Afrika ! shout the breathof righteousness and bloodin the streets of his embattled prideThe child is not dead not at Langa nor at Nyanganot at Orlando nor at Sharpevillenor at the police station at Philippiwhere he lies with a bullet through his brainThe child is the dark shadow of the soldierson guard with rifles Saracens and batonsthe child is present at all assemblies and law-givingsthe child peers through the windows of houses and into the hearts of mothersthis child who just wanted to play in the sun at Nyanga is everywherethe child grown to a man treks through all Africathe child grown into a giant journeys through the whole worldWithout a passThis is a courageous and deeply moving film about a great poet.

1505506,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B005Y5NWCE,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 2]","The beautifully produced biography ""Black Butterflies"" tells the story of South African poet Ingrid Jonker. Admittedly I was not familiar with Jonker's work or life, but it's pretty easy to determine just where the tale is headed within the first few minutes of the movie. Jonker came to international attention when one of her works about apartheid was quoted by Nelson Mandela nearly thirty years after her death. Jonker, it would seem, was another great artist living at the precipice of madness and emotional instability. A number of causes are hinted at, but nothing is really developed in ""Black Butterflies"" beyond the surface representation of a woman struggling with unknowable demons. I really wanted to know Jonker and to be devastated by her life story. But without digging deeper into her psyche, the movie never let me get close enough to its subject to appreciate her turmoil. Luckily, the role is portrayed by vibrant Carice van Houten. Van Houten brings an urgency and passion that are always compelling to watch, and this is almost enough to distinguish ""Black Butterflies"" from the many other biopics that run a very similar course.While the movie introduces Jonker as a child, it rapidly accelerates to the sixties after this brief bit of background. The Jonker we meet is a fully formed woman whose complications and independence are well established, if relatively unexplained. She has a troubled relationship with her father, a penchant for tumbling into bed with whoever is convenient, and a natural displeasure with the political situation that divides the country. She is already a known poet and already in a doomed marriage, and the screenplay sets us seemingly mid-point through her journey. Initially she appears carefree and opinionated, but soon something darker starts to manifest itself. Even as she becomes bratty and volatile, she is always beloved by the men who adore her. The principle relationship developed is with a fellow author Jack Cope, portrayed by Liam Cunningham. This is a fascinating pairing, but again I never felt the picture went quite deep enough.""Black Butterflies"" is certainly an easy recommendation, especially if you have an interest in Jonker, South Africa, or the era in which she lived. Van Houten is a fascinating actress and this gives her a showy role. Cunningham is terrific here (as usual), really grounding the story when it's needed the most. And Rutger Hauer has a nice change of pace as Jonker's domineering father, but you don't get to know too much about him. If anything, ""Black Butterflies"" stays too close to the conventional narrative that drives many an artistic biopic. I wanted the movie to be distinguished by going that extra step in trying to understand its subject. A woman with deep family issues and a ideology that put her at odds with those that controlled her country, it's a great and powerful subject. I just never felt particularly close to it despite all the good intentions in the world. Good, but not great, check it out for van Houten and Cunningham especially.

Additionally, at the core of the story is the central character, South African poet Ingrid Jonker, who is never easy or lovable, though I loved her.Unlike one of the the top reviewers, I understood her motivation and that her rebellion [and brilliance] was formed as a reaction to her neglectful, powerful, wealthy and domineering father [Rutger Hauer], the minister for censorship in the South African government. He is not only racist but sexist and as he seeks to suppress the outrage building up in his country against apartheid, he also seeks to squelch his daughter's unique and honest voice. Rather than leaving him and her past behind, Jonker's every move seems to be made in order to provoke a reaction from him whenever she can't gain his approval. In the interim, leaving her marriage, she seeks security with an older writer, who caught up in her exuberant sexuality, promotes her career. Yet all the while she undermines herself and any chance for a decent life she might make for herself and her child as her financial situation becomes precarious and her psyche becomes more and more unbalanced.Carice van Houten gives a standout performance as Jonker in this disturbing and unusual film which is notable for its period detail.

It takes the strength of something unhuman to break free from this identity, and often, the child, now a woman, cannot. It is difficult for anyone who has not endured the ceaseless perniciousness  of feeling unloved, unwanted, to comprehend the magnitude of destruction that it causes in that child, now a woman, and now swallowed by a grief so viscous that a whole life is the task of keeping one's head above water, lest she drown. And drowning seems all too often a release from the pain that pools like mercury in the very viscera of that woman, once a child, who was too weak to endure the malignancy of the parent whose only duty was to love, but who failed. Ingrid's life was not a joyous one, though it was not without its joys. She was brilliant, but her brilliance would never be acknowledged by the only people who mattered, her mother, dead whilst she was young, and her father, dead inside but still alive with an incomparable rancor. And what happened to Ingrid is what happened to that child, now a woman, now forever lost, forever struggling, and forever wading to keep from drowning, when drowning would ease all of the pain. Knowing this is her refuge and her salvation, the thing that pacifies her in the maelstrom of her life.Immediately and outwardly, we dislike Ingrid Jonker. She is careless and extreme, narcissistic and self-centered. It is because her helplessness mirrors our own that we feel this. She throws herself into her helplessness with abandon and without apology, she agnizes her pain entirely. This makes us uncomfortable. There are not many writers who are truly 'raw', as they say. Raw is the definition of someone who refuses a shield or mantle. Raw is the definition of someone who is not afraid to reveal wild emotions, even if it makes those around her uncomfortable. She wears her pain unabashedly, and this is what caused the rift between father and child. It is not her flagrant refusal to follow his rigid rules that makes him despise her, it is that her whole being is a reflection of his inability to love. In her, he sees his failure as a man and as a human. To despise her is to despise himself.They say that the sea took her, I say that she was in full control. She determined in what manner she would live, and she determined the moment that she would take herself from the world. She was a raging fire in life, and she wrote her poetry in her own flames. Had she lived longer, she may have tempered, had she found her way, had she harnessed that fire and directed it within. Shed light on the pain, and the pain will dissolve. Shed light on the fear and the fear melts away. But then, what of her poetry? What of the words that described her view of the world? It is just these words that make her the icon who we remember her as. And here we step back and we see a soul with a burden that could only be carried by a warrior, and then we can call her 'crazy' no more. Then we shall call her a warrior, because the woman, forever a child, was strong enough to carry this pain, and forge something beautiful from it.

1505510,AJRFZ0VZ0LD26,B005Y5NWCE,"Reader ""Eugenia""","[1, 1]","Most reviews of this film with compare Ingrid Jonker, poet from South Africa who died in 1965 with American poet Sylvia Plath.  I always very strongly felt that it is unfair to compare artists and in many ways, provides dis-service to both.  So let's just focus on Ingrid as this is the film abut her life and her body of work.Ingrid lived her early childhood with her mother and her maternal grandparents.  Her father was estranged from Ingrid and Ingrid's mother.  Only after Ingrid's immediate family died,  when Ingrid was at he age of 10, her father reluctantly takes Ingrid and her sister Anna to his house where they end up growing up a servants' quarters.  Ingrid's father was a high ranking politician in South Africa.  Ingirid and her father were on the complete opposites of the political spectrum.  Their mutual dislike for each other was not something either one was willing to conceal.  In order to escape her father, Ingrid marries and has a child only to find her marriage suffocating just as much as her life in her father's house.  As her marriage ends in divorce, Ingrid devotes herself to writing.  Her circle of friends consists of writers and intellectuals who are opposing apartheid.For the first time in her life, Ingrid falls in love with Jack Kopp, another writer, much older than her, who is going through a messy divorce.  Jack has her heart, but does not fully grasp Ingrid's emotional vulnerability.  Inevitable, instead of being her savior and most strident supporter -- both personally and professionally, Jack withdraws his love for Ingrid.  She never tells Jack that she was pregnant with his child because Ingrid wants him to marry her for love, not for sense of obligation or superficial decency.  Her decision to abort her love child with Jack has far more reaching effect on her than anyone, including herself can possibly imagine.  Until one day, when she witnesses death of the small black child by the policeman partolling the streets.  That event re-opens all of her supressed  traumas and unleashes stream of emotions that Ingrid can no longer contain on her own.As a mother of a small child (Ingrid has daughter Simone from her first marriage); no financial stability and constant desertion by the men she courts; Ingrid falls deeper and deeper in a state of sorrow, unhappiness and dispair that lands her in a mental hospital.  Her father opts for Ingrid to have electroshock therapy.  While this kills her ability to express her emotions and feelings, it also kills her ability to write.  Suddenly, Ingrid is stripped of everything: she cannot write, she has no protection or feeling of safety; she feels abandoned by her father, her lovers and even her sister Anna.  She sees no way out - she sees herself as death and; as poet Dylan Thomas says ""after death there is no other"".  Ingrid commits suicide by jumping into the ocean one stormy night.Many will argue how someone like Ingrid had personality disorder, was not mentally stable and was troubled.  Personally I do not think that is true.  Ingrid was deeply emotional person who could feel the pain of others and her own on a higher level.  That type of susceptable angst only true artists can feel.  That is their gift and also their curse.  They need to be constantly looked after  and taken care of, always assured of love and security.  It is love and security they missed early in their lives and those needs made a strong imprint on their personalities (and their work).  Cruelty, harshness, distance, betrayal and abandonment are too painful for them and without the proper support system leads them to self-destruction.  Ingrid Jonker, like Virginia Woolf, Sylvia Plath and so many others are fragile lighbugs, lady bugs and butterfies that very few understand and even fewer know how to protect.  Their magnetism and power is drawn from their vulnerability that is much more pronounced than it is in ordinary people...",4,Young poet's deep sorrows,1369353600,"05 24, 2013",2013,3930,"['Most', 'reviews', 'film', 'compare', 'Ingrid', 'Jonker', 'poet', 'South', 'Africa', 'who', 'died', '1965', 'American', 'poet', 'Sylvia', 'Plath', 'always', 'very', 'strongly', 'felt', 'unfair', 'compare', 'artists', 'many', 'ways', 'dis-service', 'So', 'let', 'just', 'focus', 'Ingrid', 'film', 'abut', 'life', 'body', 'work.Ingrid', 'lived', 'early', 'childhood', 'mother', 'maternal', 'grandparents', 'father', 'was', 'estranged', 'Ingrid', 'Ingrid', 'mother', 'Only', 'Ingrid', 'immediate', 'family', 'died', 'when', 'Ingrid', 'was', 'age', '10', 'father', 'reluctantly', 'Ingrid', 'sister', 'Anna', 'house', 'where', 'end', 'up', 'growing', 'up', 'servants', 'quarters', 'Ingrid', 'father', 'was', 'high', 'ranking', 'politician', 'South', 'Africa', 'Ingirid', 'father', 'were', 'complete', 'opposites', 'political', 'spectrum', 'mutual', 'dislike', 'other', 'was', 'not', 'something', 'one', 'was', 'willing', 'conceal', 'order', 'escape', 'father', 'Ingrid', 'marries', 'child', 'only', 'find', 'marriage', 'suffocating', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'life', 'father', 'house', 'marriage', 'divorce', 'Ingrid', 'writing', 'circle', 'friends', 'consists', 'writers', 'intellectuals', 'who', 'are', 'opposing', 'first', 'time', 'life', 'Ingrid', 'love', 'Jack', 'Kopp', 'writer', 'much', 'older', 'who', 'going', 'messy', 'divorce', 'Jack', 'heart', 'not', 'fully', 'grasp', 'Ingrid', 'emotional', 'vulnerability', 'Inevitable', 'instead', 'being', 'savior', 'most', 'strident', 'supporter', 'personally', 'professionally', 'Jack', 'love', 'Ingrid', 'never', 'Jack', 'was', 'pregnant', 'child', 'Ingrid', 'marry', 'love', 'not', 'sense', 'obligation', 'superficial', 'decency', 'decision', 'abort', 'love', 'child', 'Jack', 'far', 'more', 'reaching', 'effect', 'anyone', 'including', 'can', 'possibly', 'imagine', 'one', 'day', 'when', 'death', 'small', 'black', 'child', 'policeman', 'partolling', 'streets', 'event', 'supressed', 'traumas', 'unleashes', 'stream', 'emotions', 'Ingrid', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'contain', 'mother', 'small', 'child', 'Ingrid', 'daughter', 'Simone', 'first', 'marriage', 'financial', 'stability', 'constant', 'desertion', 'men', 'courts', 'Ingrid', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'state', 'sorrow', 'unhappiness', 'dispair', 'mental', 'hospital', 'father', 'opts', 'Ingrid', 'have', 'electroshock', 'therapy', 'ability', 'express', 'emotions', 'feelings', 'also', 'ability', 'write', 'Suddenly', 'Ingrid', 'stripped', 'everything', 'can', 'not', 'write', 'protection', 'feeling', 'safety', 'feels', 'abandoned', 'father', 'lovers', 'even', 'sister', 'Anna', 'way', 'death', 'poet', 'Dylan', 'Thomas', 'death', 'other', 'Ingrid', 'commits', 'suicide', 'jumping', 'ocean', 'one', 'stormy', 'night.Many', 'will', 'argue', 'how', 'someone', 'Ingrid', 'had', 'personality', 'disorder', 'was', 'not', 'mentally', 'stable', 'was', 'troubled', 'Personally', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'true', 'Ingrid', 'was', 'deeply', 'emotional', 'person', 'who', 'could', 'feel', 'pain', 'others', 'own', 'higher', 'level', 'type', 'susceptable', 'angst', 'only', 'true', 'artists', 'can', 'feel', 'gift', 'also', 'curse', 'need', 'be', 'constantly', 'looked', 'taken', 'care', 'always', 'assured', 'love', 'security', 'love', 'security', 'missed', 'early', 'lives', 'needs', 'made', 'strong', 'imprint', 'personalities', 'work', 'Cruelty', 'harshness', 'distance', 'betrayal', 'abandonment', 'are', 'too', 'painful', 'proper', 'support', 'system', 'self-destruction', 'Ingrid', 'Jonker', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'Sylvia', 'Plath', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'are', 'fragile', 'lighbugs', 'lady', 'bugs', 'butterfies', 'very', 'few', 'understand', 'even', 'fewer', 'know', 'how', 'protect', 'magnetism', 'power', 'drawn', 'vulnerability', 'much', 'more', 'pronounced', 'ordinary', 'people']",Black Butterflies [Blu-ray]
