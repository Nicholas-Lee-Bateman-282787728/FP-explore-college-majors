Erland,"[15, 15]","Filmmaker John Walker has done all of us a big favor, believers and non-believers alike, in presenting us with this wonderfully charming and informative documentary on the 'Kingdom of Fairy.'John's journey of discovery begins in Nova Scotia, Canada, a place not too unfamiliar to me having spent several summer vacations with my maternal Grandparents and extended family in and around the Isle of Newfoundland. While in Nova Scotia he takes part in a discussion with a classroom of local first graders on the topic of the elusive nature of the fairy phenomenon and the difficulty adults have in seeing them, a problem not as prevalent in children.Soon John is off to England, Ireland, Scotland and Cape Breton in search of the 'wee folk,' documenting a wonderous array of on-camera interviews, numerous firsthand accounts of fairy encounters and a wealth of information all filmed against the breathtaking beauty of the Emerald Isle.

Total running time: 77 minutes.He takes the viewer on a magical journey through England, Scotland and Cape Breton, interviewing locals and listening to their stories about the ""little people"". Many of these people's beliefs are downright questionable, and I often found myself laughing and raising an eyebrow at what some of them had to say, but I did sometimes catch myself wondering if these mysterious creatures really are just legend or if they truly do exist? I for one find it hard to believe the latter as I am more of a logistic thinker but as I look back at my childhood, I wonder if some of the things I saw and experienced as a small girl were simply a figment of my imagination or if I was seeing it all with more clarity than I ever will again because I was not yet corrupted by life as an adult - living, in the rational world, to believe that there's reasoning behind every unexplainable, supernatural occurrence. Perhaps as we grow older we build a shield around ourselves, refusing to accept things we can no longer see with our own two eyes? I'm certainly not convinced that there are fairies dwelling among us but this documentary at least makes you ponder these things...The cinematography is absolutely stunning, and the drawings they show amidst gorgeous, traditional Celtic music are beautiful to behold and listen to, magnifying the already breathtaking landscapes.

661214,A3FXT4UPI30K7S,B00005K9OL,"Cynthia Sue Larson ""best-selling author""","[11, 12]","The Fairy Faith is a delightful documentary about the wee ones, with wonderful interviews with many people who have seen fairies and elves in Ireland, Scotland, the Isle of Skye, and Canada. I especially loved the way the classic folk tales about fairies were interspersed with people telling their very own stories about first-hand observations, and the footage of the knolls and woods and streams where fairies are so often seen. The Fairy Faith really takes off toward the end of the film, where the real-life witnesses describe increasingly hair-raising incidents with fairies and elves. Another high point of this film is the interview with artist Brian Froud, whose spectacular paintings and sculptures bring the faces and personalities of fairies out of hiding and into view.Documentary film-maker John Walker describes becoming interested in fairies because of his grandmother's faith that they were real, and Walker's journey to meet with other believers is clearly intended to delve deeper into finding a better understanding for why some people have such faith in these little ones. I was impressed to see how many people in The Fairy Faith are such strong believers in fairies, and how their stories clearly indicate that there are some things we humans just barely comprehend.Of all the documentaries I've seen in recent years, this is the one that I want to watch again and again.

It deserves credit on this basis alone, especially for those of us who have a fascination with this subject. Filmmaker John Walker interviews people throughout the British Isles and Cape Breton who share their beliefs, stories and experiences with these otherworldly creatures. The film is nicely photographed; along with scenes of faery mounds and mystical landscapes there are paintings by faery artist Brian Froud (who is also interviewed) along with Victorian paintings. One of the things that becomes evident is that, for believers, the world of faery is not something to be trifled with. There are several accounts of people who paid dearly for violating the privacy of these beings. Walker also follows the case of a folklorist's ultimately successful attempt to save a tree that is allegedly sacred to faeries. It was going to be cut down to make way for a road. It was ominously predicted that many accidents were sure to occur on this site. The Fairy Faith is unlikely to convince skeptics that faeries are real.

It takes us on a tour through Ireland, Scotland, England and Cape Breton where we meet several people who share their experiences, visions, sightings and folk stories regarding fairies.  The people we meet are all charming and the scenery in these locations where faery lore is abundant is equally charming.  I thoroughly enjoyed the film.  It was like visiting with my Nana and Grandpa and hearing their tales of the faery realm.  I felt comforted by the honest matter-of-fact way they shared their feelings, ideas and experiences.  They weren't the least bit worried that they might seem far-fetched or unbelievable because in these countries there is healthy respect for the fey.  I enjoyed experiencing that openness and credibility.  I would tell anyone with an interest in faeries or the Celtic world or in magic to check this documentary out.  The reason I only give it three stars is that I didn't feel it was far-reaching enough. It really didn't knock me over in any way.  I would have been happy as can be to have come across it while channel surfing.  I would have certainly considered it a good program and worth the 77 minutes spent viewing it, though some of it was a bit on the dull side.  However, to order it and pay over...for it was too much.  It doesn't contain anything that any student of faery lore hasn't heard a hundred times.  It isn't a film I would watch again because I got the good of it from the one viewing and it's not profound enough or enlightening enough to warrant repeated viewings.

661219,A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ,B00005K9OL,"Z. Freeman ""Zach""","[3, 3]","As far as I know, this is the only documentary on the fairy/faery mythology. As other reviewers have pointed out, it doesn't leave the viewer convinced that fairies are real, or bring forth any evidence trying to state that case at all. But I don't think that that's the point of this film.As one of the interviewees remarks, ""I'm an expert on the study of this belief system and its mythology, that doesn't necassarily mean that I personally subscribe to it."" That's really the point of view of this film. The director speaks to several people in Scotland and Canada about their experiences and the stories they've heard.The main idea here is that if fairies do exist, they don't exist in the typical human realm where we can prove their existence and photograph them. They also don't exist entirely in the human imagination. Fairies occupy that mythical realm in between, whatever and whereever that is.For me this film offered a nice look into the history of fairy mythology and some beautiful scenic shots of Scotland.
