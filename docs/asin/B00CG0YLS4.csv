1646880,A3D28SE0H060MU,B00CG0YLS4,Ryan,"[0, 2]","Instead of the revenge narrative which has seemed most common in Korean crime films in the past decade or so, A Company Man takes another approach with this thriller about a professional hit man. This doesn't necessarily ensure that the storyline is original, often resembling numerous other box office hits. With a silently morally superior protagonist, A Company Man often resembles The Man From Nowhere in style and tone.The boldest choices that A Company Man makes in its narrative occur within the first ten minutes, when we are exposed to the cold-hearted ruthlessness our protagonist Hyeong-do (SO Ji-sub) is capable of. Unfortunately, the remainder of the film shows the redeeming choices that this character makes, hardly appearing to be the same man. Unable to continue the lifestyle of working as a hired killer, Hyeong-do attempts to plan a way out of his employment with the ruthless corporation dealing in death.The storyline advances toward familiar territory as our antihero becomes a hero, not only longing to get out of the business but also providing help for the family members of victims. His kind nature is what is meant to draw the audience into caring about him as the corporations assassins are also drawn in to eliminate him and provide some of the films most visceral thrills.FOR THE REST OF THE REVIEW AND MORE VISIT [...][...]",4,REAL MOVIE NEWS REVIEW,1379030400,"09 13, 2013",2013,1355,"['Instead', 'revenge', 'narrative', 'seemed', 'most', 'common', 'Korean', 'crime', 'films', 'past', 'decade', 'so', 'Company', 'Man', 'approach', 'thriller', 'professional', 'hit', 'man', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'ensure', 'storyline', 'original', 'often', 'resembling', 'numerous', 'other', 'box', 'office', 'hits', 'silently', 'morally', 'superior', 'protagonist', 'Company', 'Man', 'often', 'Man', 'Nowhere', 'style', 'tone.The', 'boldest', 'choices', 'Company', 'Man', 'narrative', 'occur', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'when', 'are', 'exposed', 'cold-hearted', 'ruthlessness', 'protagonist', 'Hyeong-do', 'SO', 'Ji-sub', 'capable', 'Unfortunately', 'remainder', 'film', 'redeeming', 'choices', 'character', 'hardly', 'appearing', 'be', 'same', 'man', 'Unable', 'continue', 'lifestyle', 'working', 'hired', 'killer', 'Hyeong-do', 'attempts', 'plan', 'way', 'employment', 'ruthless', 'corporation', 'dealing', 'death.The', 'storyline', 'advances', 'familiar', 'territory', 'antihero', 'hero', 'not', 'only', 'longing', 'get', 'business', 'also', 'providing', 'help', 'family', 'members', 'victims', 'kind', 'nature', 'what', 'meant', 'draw', 'audience', 'caring', 'about', 'corporations', 'assassins', 'are', 'also', 'drawn', 'eliminate', 'provide', 'films', 'most', 'visceral', 'REST', 'THE', 'REVIEW', 'AND', 'MORE', 'VISIT', '[', ']', '[', ']']",N/A

Every morning he goes to the office of a medium-sized ""metal trading"" enterprise in Seoul. But what people in the same building do not know is that Ji Hyeong-Do has been working for the company that in fact specializes in contract killings. He is a faithful ""company man"" who gets paid and even ""promoted"" for what he does. He is even tasked with ""firing"" his co-workers.One day Ji Hyeong-Do's perfect life as first-rate killer starts to change, however, when he chooses not to follow a certain part of the order given to him. This leads to his meeting with Yu Mi-yeon (Mi-yeon Lee), mother of two children. And Yu Mi-yeon was a singer Ji Hyeong-Do adored when he was young.A 2012 Korean thriller ""A Company Man"" is more about the central character Ji Hyeong-Do and his transformation than about the brutal fights he has to go through. The action is sparse, especially in the first half of the film, but once it begins, it gets pretty tense with bloody and violent combat scenes.Perhaps writer and director Sang-yoon Lim (his feature debut) could have developed the relationship between the salaried killer and the retired singer. Some of the subplots are also underdeveloped, with a police detective whose role the film could have used more effectively. With the superb acting from the cast and intense climax, however, ""A Company Man"" is worth checking out.",4,"(3.5 STARS) ""A Company Man"" or a Salaried Killer in a Suit",1370822400,"06 10, 2013",2013,1464,"['surface', 'Ji', 'Hyeong-Do', 'Ji-seob', 'So', 'other', 'ordinary', 'businessman', 'commuting', 'train', 'morning', 'office', 'medium-sized', 'metal', 'trading', 'enterprise', 'Seoul', 'what', 'people', 'same', 'building', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'Ji', 'Hyeong-Do', 'been', 'working', 'company', 'fact', 'specializes', 'contract', 'killings', 'faithful', 'company', 'man', 'who', 'paid', 'even', 'promoted', 'what', 'even', 'tasked', 'firing', 'co-workers.One', 'day', 'Ji', 'Hyeong-Do', 'perfect', 'life', 'first-rate', 'killer', 'change', 'however', 'when', 'not', 'follow', 'certain', 'part', 'order', 'given', 'meeting', 'Yu', 'Mi-yeon', 'Mi-yeon', 'Lee', 'mother', 'two', 'children', 'Yu', 'Mi-yeon', 'was', 'singer', 'Ji', 'Hyeong-Do', 'adored', 'when', 'was', 'young.A', '2012', 'Korean', 'thriller', 'Company', 'Man', 'more', 'central', 'character', 'Ji', 'Hyeong-Do', 'transformation', 'brutal', 'fights', 'go', 'action', 'sparse', 'especially', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'once', 'pretty', 'tense', 'bloody', 'violent', 'combat', 'scenes.Perhaps', 'writer', 'director', 'Sang-yoon', 'Lim', 'feature', 'debut', 'could', 'have', 'developed', 'relationship', 'salaried', 'killer', 'retired', 'singer', 'subplots', 'are', 'also', 'underdeveloped', 'police', 'detective', 'role', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'more', 'effectively', 'superb', 'acting', 'cast', 'intense', 'climax', 'however', 'Company', 'Man', 'worth', 'checking', 'out']",N/A
