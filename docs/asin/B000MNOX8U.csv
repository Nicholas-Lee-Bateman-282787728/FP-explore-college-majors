I think it's a pretty good tribute to the original, bringing Lance Henrickson back. Also, there is some good gore, with throat slashings and an impalement. The first half of the movie is better than the second half, though. The first half is pretty much non-stop action, but things slip a bit in the second half. It's too bad, too, because if the final half of the film would have kept the momentum going I would've given it a four star rating.

Over the years Pumpkinhead seems to have lost his lure except for the devoted fans, but still manages to put out a new straight to dvd release out every couple years. At this point the stories are becoming more of a stretch but are still enjoyable enough to watch. You pretty much know what you are getting into and shouldn't really set the bar too high anymore.The film begins with a small town becoming enraged after finding out a local doctor and his family have been robbing graves. As they ponder a way to get even with the doctor they decide the best revenge will be to summon Pumpkinhead. Even though they are warned by the spirit of Ed Harley they continue on with their plan and visit the old witch. Man she must be like 150 years old by now. The witch agrees to evoke the spirit as long as they bring her the body of Ed Harley, and they do. Now Pumpkinhead is unleashed as boy is it a mistake. Not only does he go after the doctor but simply destroys anything within arms reach. Once again we are shown it's never worth resurrecting Pumpkinhead no matter what the situation is.Ashes to Ashes really isn't as terrible as some say it is. They do have some valid points because it is pretty weak as far as Pumpkinhead goes, but there were some positives. The acting was surprisingly decent and the creatures costume wasn't too bad either. Of course they went the route of some CGI which added a lot of laughs on the evening. Some of the effects were just terribly fake looking, but for me it adds a type of charm to the film.

While this time we actually see some things revisited by that from the first movie, Lance Henriksen reprises his role as Ed Harley, but this time it's only his soul who we see throughout the movie, along with seeing the old witch Haggis.  Like with the first movie left off, we seen the necklace that Harley's son had given him around Pumpkinhead's neck, wondering what that was about, though in this movie it's shown that Ed Harley is Pumpkinhead in some way.  Although that the CGI wasn't that good in the movie, though I have to say that it may have been due to the low budget that they may have been given for the movie, since most direct to DVD/Video movies.  Although that in this movie, there was a little of a different approach in terms of calling Pumpkinhead.  While it was normally one person that had called upon the beast, this time it was more than one, which was a nice twist to say the least.

1047876,A3UA046AA3DXFD,B000MNOX8U,Sid the Elf,"[5, 6]","When thinking of beloved horror characters Pumpkinhead is one of the first to come to mind. There's no better time then October to pay homage to our giant headed redneck killing friend so when Ashes to Ahes turned up on tv there was really no choice. Checking out some other reviews made the film seem like it would be a complete waste but since b is our business we had to see for ourselves. Luckily it wasn't quite as bad as some thought but it's definately the weakest of the Pumkinhead series. You can't get mad about it though. Who doesn't love seeing Pumpkinhead? Even if the film is weaker then the first and second it's still a fun watch. The concept is still great and much more put together then most of the garbage the horror industry comes up with now.We start with the townspeople becoming enraged when a local doctor and his grave robbing family desecrate the bodies of the recently deceased, forcing then to summon the help of the mighty warlord Pumpkinhead. Hey when you're seeking vengence what better way to go then to ressurect Pumpkinhead? Despite warnings from the spirit of Ed Harley urging them not ekove the demon they go and find the witch who can do just that. They explain the situation and she agrees as long as they bring her Ed's body. Once they bring his corpse to her she works her magic and we see a pretty sweet morphing scene where the giant Pumpkinhead is back in business. Have to give it up to the special effects crew because they did a great job making him look more frightening then ever.Now that Pumpkinhead is on the loose it's time for vengence. The only issue is he knows no bounds and starts tearing up everyone in sight. Yeah awesome! Within the course of a half hour we see him backhand about 10 hicks, throw a few through walls, burst through a church roof, set the priest on fire, and slice up some of the towns people with his razor sharp claws. We find out one of the guys Ed Harley's spirit appears to is the son of George ""Buck"" Flower Wallace. The same son that told Ed in the original where he could find the witch to bring Pumpkinhead to life. So we have a lot of flashbacks to the first film which was pretty cool. Now George's kid is sorry they evoked the evil force and want to find a way to stop the choas. Then we hit a boring patch where not much happens and we don't see any creature action. Finally towards the end things really heat up and the corrupt doctor gets his by being impailed from Pumpkinheads tail. That was really great. Now even though justice was served Pumpkinhead doesn't know how to draw the line and continues on his war path. The only way he can be stopped is one of the girls must commit suicide which will send him back where he came from. So she does so by jumping into a cremator and burning herself alive. Probably could've found a less painful way to go but who are we to question the ground be stands upon?All in all the film wasn't great but still very enjoyable. It really seemed to follow the original film concept with some minor changes making it feel more like a remake then anything else. The differences here were a lot more computer generated effects to show Pumpkinhead doing things like climbing a wall or jumping off a roof. Could've done without then though. They really were pretty fake looking and quite hilarious. The Pumpkinhead make-up is so great all they need to do is focus on that to make it a success, don't bother with the CG crap. For any fan of the genre or Pumpkinhead series this one is worth the watch. Hey it's b which makes it fun no matter how bad.

A ""part 3"" made nearly 20 years after the original could have ended up being quite lousy, especially given the fact that this was one of those Sci-Fi Channel deals.  Since this film conjures up the same rules and mythology of the original film, you pretty much know what to expect.  However, the director is able to make this familiar story interesting.  We all know that Pumpkinhead can be summoned to pull some demonic Charles Bronson worthy revenge on specific wrongdoers, if you're willing to pay the price.  The price being that the summoners feel the pain of Pumpkinhead's victims, and they usually realize after it's too late, that setting this monster in motion becomes too much to handle.  Plus, the only way for Pumpkinhead to die is for his summoner(s) to die.  The unfortunate folks who get Pumpkinhead unleashed on their asses are a group of murderin' folks who are in the black market organ business.  These folks consist of a meth addict goth chick, the boy from the first film(all grown up of course), and one or two more.  But the ringleader is the town doctor played by none other than Pinhead himself, Doug Bradley.  Pumpkinhead has been summoned by four young folks who want these schmucks wiped out.  Evil doc Bradley figures it all out and sets out to kill all four of these people in order to kill Pumpkinhead before Pumpkinhead kills him.  Kind of a double cat and mouse game.  Pretty cool.  Bits of CGI are thrown in and they look dreadful(as usual), but I was glad to see this kept at a minimum, relying instead on good old fashioned monster makeup and a rubber suited actor.  This movie started to worry me in it's last 20 minutes or so coz being a modern horror film, it looked like it was gonna go for a slick, convenient, happy ending that contradicted the awesome downer ending of the first film.  Luckily it was a red herring and the ending delivered in true Pumpkinhead tradition.  Lance Henriksen is kinda wasted in a few fleeting scenes as the spirit of his character in the first film who pops up now and again to warn and guide.  Lance is so friggin' cool that you'd think if you were making a movie and got him, you'd use him as much and the best you could.  Oh, well.  A spirit character can only do so much I guess.  Yes, I was impressed and entertained coz this movie could have been so bad, but luckily everyone involved knew what they were doing.

I did not have high expectations at all, but I did expect it to live up to the title of sequel and not reinvent the story like Pumpkinhead II: Blood Wings did.I was worried that the scenes with Lance Henriksen were going to be reused footage ""flashbacks"" from the original movie, but my worries were put to rest. Lance Henriksen isn't in the film for longer than a few minutes at a time, but his presence as the ghost of Ed Harley was welcomed, and his connection to Pumpkinhead helped to tie this movie to the original.The bad CGI was glaringly obvious, and is the only real low point for me. It just didn't need to be in the movie, and made it hard to get back into the film after seeing it. I think this has happened to other people and left such a bad tasted in their mouths that they couldn't give a better review of this movie.What helped me through the movie most were the references to the original film. Ed Harley's necklace, Ed Harley himself, the witch, Bunt Wallace (The grown version of the boy in the first film), and even the pumpkin patch. All this carried the film for me and made it an enjoyable watch.",4,Not as bad as other reviewers describe!,1220918400,"09 9, 2008",2008,1296,"['watching', 'movie', 'knew', 'was', 'was', 'direct-to-dvd', 'film', 'was', 'rumored', 'be', 'true', 'sequel', 'original', 'film', 'becasue', 'would', 'include', 'Lance', 'Henriksen', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'high', 'expectations', 'did', 'expect', 'live', 'up', 'title', 'sequel', 'not', 'reinvent', 'story', 'Pumpkinhead', 'II', 'Blood', 'Wings', 'did.I', 'was', 'worried', 'scenes', 'Lance', 'Henriksen', 'were', 'going', 'be', 'reused', 'footage', 'flashbacks', 'original', 'movie', 'worries', 'were', 'put', 'rest', 'Lance', 'Henriksen', ""n't"", 'film', 'longer', 'few', 'minutes', 'time', 'presence', 'ghost', 'Ed', 'Harley', 'was', 'welcomed', 'connection', 'Pumpkinhead', 'helped', 'tie', 'movie', 'original.The', 'bad', 'CGI', 'was', 'glaringly', 'obvious', 'only', 'real', 'low', 'point', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'movie', 'made', 'hard', 'get', 'back', 'film', 'seeing', 'think', 'happened', 'other', 'people', 'left', 'bad', 'tasted', 'mouths', 'could', ""n't"", 'give', 'better', 'review', 'movie.What', 'helped', 'movie', 'most', 'were', 'references', 'original', 'film', 'Ed', 'Harley', 'necklace', 'Ed', 'Harley', 'witch', 'Bunt', 'Wallace', 'grown', 'version', 'boy', 'first', 'film', 'even', 'pumpkin', 'patch', 'carried', 'film', 'made', 'enjoyable', 'watch']",N/A
