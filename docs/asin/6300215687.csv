Their relationship makes this film really interesting with the ants the chemical tonic like a cupid's arrow that brings the troubled couple closer and eventually to fall in love. The script is nice penned, the main characters each have depth (let's not forget the always reliable William Conrad in an early role as the commissioner and Heston's confidante) and the story moves along at a nice pace. The best part though remains Eleanor Parker. Always stunning, she is especially worth seeing here as she plays a woman who ""has been around"" with fine balance, vulnerable but strong at the same time.

He is also at war with his heart, as he tries to stay aloof to his mail order bride from New Orleans, the beautiful Eleanor Parker. Parker is cool as a mint julep in her Edith Head gowns, and tough enough to stand by her man; the chemistry between them sizzles, and they look so very fine together.William Conrad is also good as the Commissioner, as he warns them to escape the billions of approaching ants which are &quot;forty square miles of agonizing death !&quot;.One of the best things about this film is the soundtrack by Daniele Amfitheatrof, which owes a lot to Stravinsky and Darius Milhaud, and is perfect in the way it underscores the dialogue, and accentuates the action. It's really worth just listening to this film once, to fully appreciate the music and the sound effects.Ernest Lazlo's Techicolor cinematography is marvelous, and the Byron Haskin direction fast paced, with Heston doing most of his own stunts, which included having those nasty ants crawling on him.Some of this film is quite exciting, some of it hilarious, and it's always extremely entertaining, and is the absolute best of the bug genre films.As the ants bare the jungle, Eleanor tries to bare Chuck's soul...will she succeed ? watch this superb jungle romance and find out !Total running time is 95 minutes.",5,fire ants and fiery hearts,1089158400,"07 7, 2004",2004,1563,"['Set', '1901', 'Amazon', 'jungle', 'fabulous', 'quot', 'Insect', 'Feature', 'quot', 'excellent', 'special', 'effects', 'atmosphere', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'mucho', 'macho', 'man', 'who', 'war', 'dreaded', 'marabunta', 'killer', 'red', 'ants', 'who', 'threaten', 'take', 'over', 'plantation', 'also', 'war', 'heart', 'stay', 'aloof', 'mail', 'order', 'New', 'Orleans', 'beautiful', 'Eleanor', 'Parker', 'Parker', 'cool', 'mint', 'julep', 'Edith', 'Head', 'gowns', 'tough', 'enough', 'stand', 'man', 'chemistry', 'sizzles', 'look', 'so', 'very', 'fine', 'together.William', 'Conrad', 'also', 'good', 'Commissioner', 'escape', 'billions', 'approaching', 'ants', 'are', 'quot', 'forty', 'square', 'miles', 'agonizing', 'death', 'quot', '.One', 'best', 'things', 'film', 'soundtrack', 'Daniele', 'Amfitheatrof', 'lot', 'Stravinsky', 'Darius', 'Milhaud', 'perfect', 'way', 'dialogue', 'action', 'really', 'worth', 'just', 'listening', 'film', 'once', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'music', 'sound', 'effects.Ernest', 'Lazlo', 'Techicolor', 'cinematography', 'marvelous', 'Byron', 'Haskin', 'direction', 'fast', 'paced', 'Heston', 'doing', 'most', 'own', 'stunts', 'included', 'having', 'nasty', 'ants', 'crawling', 'him.Some', 'film', 'quite', 'exciting', 'hilarious', 'always', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'absolute', 'best', 'bug', 'genre', 'films.As', 'ants', 'bare', 'jungle', 'Eleanor', 'bare', 'Chuck', 'soul', 'will', 'succeed', 'watch', 'superb', 'jungle', 'romance', 'find', 'out', 'Total', 'running', 'time', '95', 'minutes']",N/A

For the adventurers, you have Charlton Heston as the solitary, brooding male hero who has cut a magnificent swath through the jungle using his bare hands and the help of only several hundred unworthy underlings to whom he is a patriarchal god.  The encroaching marabunta provide the exciting challenge to his domain.  For the romantics, you have the encroaching mail-order bride, wonderfully played by a breathless, bosomy, brainy Eleanor Parker, who, after a few stumbles along the way, cuts a magnificent swath through Heston.The movie has several memorable features:  the wonderful banter between the protagonists, especially the bits about the piano--hilarious; the virginal Heston, who came to the jungle as a youngster and never went near the village women, shaking in his riding boots at the prospect of an experienced bride and blustering to shore up his defenses against her; and a wily female lead who plays it oh so smart.  Oh yeah, the adventure stuff is good too (can you tell I'm a romantic)?Whether you see the marabunta as a metaphor for the relationship or vice-versa, the film is a monument to Hollywoodized sexual repression.

217622,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,6300215687,Byron Kolln,"[5, 5]","I watched this movie last night, and all I can say is....WOW!  This is a top adventure starring one of my favourite actresses, Eleanor Parker, teamed with Charlton Heston (and based on a story by Carl Stephenson).  If you love movies like ""King Solomon's Mines"", ""Mogambo"" and especially ""Elephant Walk"", you'll adore THE NAKED JUNGLE.The story follows mail-order bride Joanna (Eleanor Parker) as she travels deep into the jungle to meet prospective husband Christopher Leiningen (Charlton Heston), a successful plantation baron, grown embittered by too many years of solitude.  Their marriage is stormy from the outset; headstrong Joanna constantly clashes with her belligerent spouse, but they soon have bigger problems on their hands.  A terrifying army of soldier ants, on their twenty-year migration, are steadily approaching, leaving a trail of death and destruction in their wake.With more than a passing nod to the similarly-themed ""Elephant Walk"" (also produced by Paramount around the same period), THE NAKED JUNGLE is part costume drama, part adventure epic and all-entertainment.  The supporting cast even includes Abraham Sofaer (who plays a role not too dissimilar from the one he fills in ""Elephant Walk"").Female co-stars who could successfully balance themselves opposite the imposing Charlton Heston were often very difficult to find, but Eleanor Parker is and was the perfect choice for Joanna.  One of the rare actresses who was every bit as talented as she was stunningly-beautiful (as evidenced from her Academy Award-nominated performances in ""Caged!"", ""Detective Story"" and ""Interrupted Melody""), Ms Parker provides a performance with equal parts heart and humanity.  Her scenes with Heston are a complete joy.  Costume designer Edith Head dresses Parker in some lovely late-Victorian clothes.Filmed in glorious Technicolor, THE NAKED JUNGLE explodes off the screen with colour and high-adventure to spare.  Sadly, the DVD offers no extras.

Wonderfully directed by Byron Haskin (Treasure Island, The War of the Worlds), The Naked Jungle stars an excellent Charlton Heston (Ben Hur, Touch of Evil), Eleanor Parker (Scaramouche), William (TV's Frank Canon, P.I.) Conrad and a whole lotta ants (imagine a column of voracious ants two miles long and twenty miles wide...we're gonna need the industrial size Raid)...or, Marabunta, as they're often referred to within the movie.The film, which takes place deep in the South American jungle, begins with a rather refined looking lady completely out of place on a funky river barge traveling deep in the heart of the jungle.  The woman's name is Joanna Leiningen (Parker), and she's on her way to meet her husband, Christopher Leiningen (Heston), at his expansive cocoa plantation.  They've never met before, as Christopher, who's spent the last fifteen years or so building his plantation so deep in the jungle has not had time to find a wife, so he arranged for his brother, who was stateside, to find an appropriate woman to which he could marry by proxy and then she would eventually travel to the plantation and set up residence. The newlyweds finally meet, and things don't go very well as Christopher, who's lived in the jungle for awhile (perhaps too long) has misgivings about his new wife, as certain details about her past are revealed.  Joanna, a strong-willed woman, chaffs against Christopher's somewhat chauvinistic expectations, but does try to find her place, as she believes the choice to enter into this arrangement was right, but now seems for naught as Christopher decides she should return to the states, that is until it's learned that the Marabunta (normally content to dwell within their mounds, but every once in awhile, like 20 years or so, they organize and ravage the surrounding countryside) are cutting a swath through the jungle, with Christopher's plantation directly in their path, restricting any travel whatsoever, and problems of martial incompatibility become small potatoes against the approaching horde devouring everything they come upon, vegetation, animals, humans (death by hundreds of thousands of tiny, little bites?  Seems a particularly nasty way to go...), etc.I really enjoyed this film.  The characters were well written, and are presented in an intelligent, engaging manner.  The level of development of the characters of Christopher and Joanna was interesting and fills out pretty much the first half of the film.  The second half is mostly comprised of the arrival of the ants, and the feeble efforts to stop this seemingly unstoppable force, first protecting the plantation, but soon for their own survival.  Heston is excellent as Christopher, a man dedicated to realizing his dream, wrenching it (respectfully) from the living jungle, and the unquestioned master of his world, forced to contend with someone who isn't meant to be controlled (Joanna) and a menace that can't be controlled (the ants).  He's basically a good man, but given his inexperience with women, his isolation from the outside world, and his accustomed complete authority over most all things within his domain, he's completely unprepared for a woman the likes of Joanna, even though it may be the thing he needs most.  I thought Eleanor Parker did extremely well (and she certainly ain't bad to look at).  Before this film, I was unfamiliar with her work, but she presented a wonderful character in Joanna, a stubborn woman with a past who believes she's found her purpose, even if it means living isolated from everything she knew, working to change the seemingly simplistic and maybe even unrealistic attitudes of her new husband (apparently he was looking for a trophy wife, but got a whole lot more than he bargained for with Joanna).  It was really wonderful to see these two clash within character, and I really can't imagine anyone else in their roles after seeing the film.  The threat of the ants was done very well, and appeared very realistic, especially through the use of matte paintings depicting the destruction caused as they scoured the landscape.  It's hard to visualize something as small as an ant causing so much damage, but when you see billions of them swarming over everything and anything, it certainly seems possible.  Haskin's direction really kept my interest throughout the film, and he was certainly helped by having highly professional and experienced actors involved in the project.  All in all, an excellent feature with a climatic and satisfying conclusion.The film on this DVD is presented in the full screen format, which, I believe is as it was originally released, and then later changed to wide screen (the wide screen format became more popular as the 50's wore on, as theaters transitioned to accommodate it).  The picture is clear and sharp and the audio is very good, but there are absolutely no special features included in this release, not even the usual theatrical trailer.  Perhaps we'll see a special edition released at a later date, as it seems more and more (much to my annoyance) studios release a barebones version first, and then later release a `special edition', allowing them to increase their profits, that is if those of us who bought the original see fit to purchase the product again with the enticements of more features, essentially making us believe the `upgrade' is worth buying.

The lonely Heston commissioned his brother to find him a wife in New Orleans.Heston's mail order bride turned out to be the headstrong, refined and attractive redhead Eleanor Parker.  Their personalities immediately clashed and Heston planned to send her back home when a calamitous event suddenly occurred.  The plantation came under the attack of an enormous colony of army ants which threatened to destroy everything in its path.  The courage shown by both actors during this crisis cemented their relationship as they commence a new life together amid the devastation.Byron Haskin's flick was typical of the heroic and romantic style of adventure flicks in the 50's.

217642,A7RM685PHBK20,6300215687,Eric,"[24, 28]","The Naked Jungle is a surprisingly likeable movie.  From the title, one either believes it's an erotic film or a comedy, both of which it is neither.  The film is actually a mixture of romance and adventure, along  with some doses of action and suspense and the combination is well  done.Eleanor Parker stars as Joanna Leinengen, a strong-willed,  beautiful, and independent young woman who has been married via mail to  Christopher Leinengen, played by Charlton Heston.  He owns and lives in his  plantation in South America so she travels by boat from the United States  to meet him for the very first time.  When she arrives, they don't get off  to a very good start and Christopher ignores quite a bit and treats her  without respect.  However, as the time goes by romantic feelings begin to  develop between them.  But a problem is beginning to grow in the jungle.  A  20 mile long, 2 mile wide line of soldier ants is headed for Christopher's  plantation and is devouring everything in its path.  Now, Christopher and  Joanna must think quickly and defend their home from the tiny  predators.I honestly had no idea what this movie was about when I popped  it into the VCR.  It's truly a pleasant surprise as the romance in the film  is well done with a lot of chemistry between Parker and Heston.

So if you liked ""Elephant Walk"" (1954) or ""King Solomon's Mines"" (1950), this one's most definitely for you!What stands out, IMO, besides the special effects (good for 1954) and scenes dealing the Marabunta invasion, is the great chemistry between sultry, elegant, appealing Eleanor Parker (Joanna Leiningen), at her prettiest and most ladylike, but at the same time, full of passion, ardour and desire to love a real man...and there he is, Charlton Heston (Leiningen), at the peak of his macho-man magnetism with the ladies (my mother told me that she absolutelly swooned over him around the time he made this film). He conveys very well the character's contradictions between his insecurities as man and his desire for this wondrous woman (Parker), chosen to be his wife by his brother.The first part of the film has plenty of scenes that fully display, elegantly in 1950s style, the sexual tension between the characters played by both leads. They make one of the handsomest couples ever paired. William Conrad (of ""Jake and the Fatman"" fame) is good as the friendly comissioner. Abraham Sofaer plays a similar role than in ""Elephant Walk"", but this time more sympathetic towards the heroine.Some footage must have been filmed on location, but almost all of the scenes involving the leading players were obviously filmed in Paramount's backlot.Good entertainment!

This is how ""The Naked Jungle"" begins, it's South America 1901.  Christopher Laninger (Charlton Heston) has sent for a mail order bride (the exquisite Eleanor Parker) who is making her way to his vast jungle plantation by boat.  A young, but very recognizable, William Conrad (t.v.'s detective ""Cannon"") plays a South American lawman who visits the plantation from time to time.  Abraham Sofaer plays the plantation head overseer (as he also does in the 1953 jungle-plantation classic ""Elephant Walk.""  I knew I recognized that nose!)  The introduction of Eleanor Parker to her new husband is filled with drama, friction, and intrigue.  Heston wants everything he owns to be ""new"" and ""un-handled.""  When Eleanor reveals that she's previously been married, but then became a widow, Heston abrutly informs her she's ""another man's leavings"" and wants her to leave.  Heston's character longs for her and as the story progresses, falls secretly in love with her.  When the jungle is swept with a plague of killer ants, they are brought together by Eleanor's strong determination to stay and win Heston over.  The dvd's transfer is perfect with beautiful color and superb sound.  I highly recommend this dvd, as well as sister jungle plantation romantic drama, ""Elephant Walk,"" starring the beautiful Elizabeth Taylor, with at-the-time- husband Peter Finch, and Dana Andrews.

Eleanor Parker plays a mail order bride ordered by Heston to share his life with him. Things do not turn out as either expect. He is disappointed that she has been married previously. He cannot stand the idea of following someone else. Even so, he is an honorable person by his own standards. He wishes her no ill but, being socially inept, comes across as an ogre. He has his problems but is not as bad as he seems.She, on the other hand, really wants the relationship to succeed. She is willing to put up with a lot but she does have her limits and her own conception of honor as well as right and wrong. Finally, when she thinks she can stand him no more, he decides to send her back. He is attracted to her but can't get over her past.The relationship begins to change when they head upriver to investigate some strange happenings. Heston takes her along because he figures he can arrange return passage for her. It never happens. They find the source of the strange reports and it turns out that an army of ants is on the march. Parker's courage in the face of the natural disaster brings to two of them together. His stalwart defense doesn't hurt either.The story is a credible if overblown dramatization of the fury of certain insects in South America. It does not rely on any ""science fiction"" gimmicks. The characterizations are creditable as well. That being the case, its hard to identify why this film is not better than it is. I suppose that this was one of Heston's earlier films.

217661,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,6300215687,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","This is a surprisingly interesting ""oldie but goldie"" film and a very honest watch - not a masterpiece, but a good, solid adventure/drama film. Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS!The story happens in 1901, somewhere in the deep jungle in high Amazon wilderness. In the short story which inspired the scenario of this film (""Leiningen versus the ants"" by German writer Carl Stephenson, published in 1937), the action was happening in Brazil - here however the country is not defined and local Indians speak only native languages, not Portuguese or Spanish. However the name of the country is not so important here - what matter is that the place of action is situated in the middle of extremely hostile jungle, where modern civilization exists only in the residences of owners of great plantations. Everywhere else is the primal forest, great rivers and swamps.In this wild country a white American named Christopher Leiningen (Charlton Heston) arrived once twenty years ago as a young man owning virtually nothing. With his own backbreaking labour and iron determination he first created a little cocoa plantation. Then, thanks to his charisma, business skills and ruthlessness he transformed this little estate into a giant plantation which employs many hundreds local Indians - and as his little kingdom expands, more and more Indians come from the Amazon jungle to take jobs and move to the villages he build for his workers. Leiningen lives alone (with just ahandful of servants) in a huge, luxurious manor he erected in the middle of his plantation - from there he manages his estates and rules other the whole area as a feudal lord.But after building his empire, Leiningen wants finally to marry and have a family. He wants an American wife, but refuses to leave his kingdom for courtship - instead he charges his brother and his attorneys in USA to buy him a mail-order bride according to his specifications. As Leiningen's ego is as immense as his fortune, so are his requirements for his future wife. The film begins at that moment, with the arrival at the plantation of the recently purchased Mrs Leiningen (Eleanor Parker).The greatest value of this film resides in the extremely uneasy relationship between those two recently married people who never saw one another before. Leiningen is a despot, used to order people around and expecting a total obedience in everything - he is comletely not used to the presence on his side of a person who is NOT a subaltern or an employee but an equal partner. Mrs Leinington is an even more complex person. Even if for all practical purposes she sold herself, she has a great, calm dignity. She is also resolved to hold her end of the bargain and she wants to ""be a good wife"", but her husband will not make it easy at all... There will be quite a lot of drama - and also some destroyed furniture and crockery... And then, there are also all the HUGE skeletons waiting to walk out of the closets - on both sides of this relation... And once they are out, trumpeting elephants will parade in the middle of the room at every moment and refuse to leave...)))Both main actors are excellent in this film. Charlton Heston was always a very powerful physically actor but in this beginning of his career he was also extremely handsome - and that certainly doesn't hurt this film. Eleanor Parker was also a very beautiful woman and a good actress with it - she played her character very impressively.As signalled before, at one moment a new factor will appear in the equation - the marabunta otherwise known as legionary ants. For the needs of this film (as in the short story) those very real creatures were significantly ""upgraded"", to make them more lethal... Will their appearance achieve to destroy the already greatly fragilised marriage? Well, you will have to discover it by yourself.Bottom line, this is a good, solid film, very pleasant to watch, with some quite unexpected surprises waiting to jump at us. Not a great masterpiece, but definitely worth seeing. I will keep my DVD for a possible future re-watch.

217663,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,6300215687,Martin Asiner,"[2, 4]","One of Hollywood's favorite themes is the hero's attempt to remake nature in his own image. Sometimes the arena is Wall Street, sometimes a Wild West town, and sometimes a Brazilian jungle. In THE NAKED JUNGLE, director Byron Haskin has created a vastly underappreciated film that combines action/adventure with romance. Usually, for this kind of hybrid movie to resonate with the audience, there must be present a thematic 'hook' with which viewers can connect viscerally either to the hero or the plot. In this case, Charlton Heston, who plays Christopher Leiningen, provides this hook as he presents himself as a man on a self-appointed mission to tame a wilderness that beckons to him. Years before the movie begins, he entered the Amazon with little more than his unswerving determination to twist nature into his own divine plan.  He hews out of the jungle an empire in which the natives serve him as a medieval lord.  And as a lord, he has a moat and castle filled with the rudiments of civilization that remind him daily that to rule without a queen is hardly to rule at all.  He chooses not to avail himself of the company of native women, any one of whom presumably would jump at the chance to be his consort.  His mania for quality possessions carries over to his idealized vision of a Virgin Queen.  He sends to the United States for a mail order bride in much the same way that he sends for the objects that fill his castle.  He insists on numbers and quantifiable components to his many dreams.  Just as he once ordered 800 pounds of classic books to fill his library, he now orders a virgin bride (Eleanor Parker), who is gorgeous, blond, articulate.  Unfortunately, she was previously married and his perception of her as 'used goods' sets up the tension for the first half of the film. The focus in the second half shifts to another form of nature that also resists his control.  The natives call it 'marabunta,' a 20 mile wide by 2 mile long army of voracious ants, consuming all in its path.There are several outstanding scenes that make this film work. Heston's interpretation of the monomaniacal medieval ruler begins to soften as he realizes that there are some aspects of nature that resist taming. He can carve out a jungle empire with his bare hands. He can even confront a marauding ant army with those same hands, but when he faces a woman who has her own ideas about her place in his Amazon landscape, then he is forced to acknowledge that to get, he must first give. His ruined forest is a small price to pay to learn this eternal truism.",4,The Naked Jungle: To Tame Nature is Risky,1027468800,"07 24, 2002",2002,2567,"['One', 'Hollywood', 'favorite', 'themes', 'hero', 'attempt', 'remake', 'nature', 'own', 'image', 'arena', 'Wall', 'Street', 'sometimes', 'Wild', 'West', 'town', 'sometimes', 'Brazilian', 'jungle', 'THE', 'NAKED', 'JUNGLE', 'director', 'Byron', 'Haskin', 'created', 'vastly', 'underappreciated', 'film', 'action/adventure', 'romance', 'Usually', 'kind', 'hybrid', 'movie', 'resonate', 'audience', 'must', 'be', 'present', 'thematic', ""'hook"", 'viewers', 'can', 'connect', 'viscerally', 'hero', 'plot', 'case', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'who', 'Christopher', 'Leiningen', 'hook', 'man', 'self-appointed', 'mission', 'tame', 'wilderness', 'beckons', 'Years', 'movie', 'entered', 'Amazon', 'little', 'more', 'unswerving', 'determination', 'twist', 'nature', 'own', 'divine', 'plan', 'jungle', 'empire', 'natives', 'serve', 'medieval', 'lord', 'lord', 'moat', 'castle', 'filled', 'rudiments', 'civilization', 'daily', 'rule', 'queen', 'hardly', 'rule', 'not', 'avail', 'company', 'native', 'women', 'one', 'whom', 'presumably', 'would', 'jump', 'chance', 'be', 'consort', 'mania', 'quality', 'possessions', 'idealized', 'vision', 'Virgin', 'Queen', 'United', 'States', 'mail', 'order', 'bride', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'objects', 'fill', 'castle', 'numbers', 'quantifiable', 'components', 'many', 'dreams', 'Just', 'once', 'ordered', '800', 'pounds', 'classic', 'books', 'fill', 'library', 'now', 'orders', 'virgin', 'bride', 'Eleanor', 'Parker', 'who', 'gorgeous', 'blond', 'articulate', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'previously', 'married', 'perception', ""'used"", 'goods', 'sets', 'tension', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'focus', 'second', 'half', 'shifts', 'form', 'nature', 'also', 'control', 'natives', 'call', '20', 'mile', 'wide', '2', 'mile', 'long', 'army', 'voracious', 'ants', 'consuming', 'are', 'several', 'outstanding', 'scenes', 'make', 'film', 'work', 'Heston', 'interpretation', 'monomaniacal', 'medieval', 'ruler', 'soften', 'are', 'aspects', 'nature', 'resist', 'taming', 'can', 'carve', 'out', 'jungle', 'empire', 'bare', 'hands', 'can', 'even', 'confront', 'marauding', 'ant', 'army', 'same', 'hands', 'when', 'woman', 'who', 'own', 'ideas', 'place', 'Amazon', 'landscape', 'then', 'forced', 'acknowledge', 'get', 'must', 'first', 'give', 'ruined', 'forest', 'small', 'price', 'pay', 'learn', 'eternal', 'truism']",N/A

Trusting his brother in New Orleans to pick out a woman for him to marry, they wed by proxy.The wife ""Joanna"" (played by the beautiful and talented Eleanor Parker) arrives to meet her husband for the first time and finds one very hard (but handsome) man - who behaves like a total rude jerk to her.  Turns out he wasn't expecting to ""hit the jackpot"" with his mail order bride (she's very beautiful, educated, speaks many languages, plays piano, etc.) so he is suspicious trying to find out what's ""wrong"" with her because his luck isn't that good.  Well, he finds the fault - she's no virgin, she's been married before (info. his brother withheld from him) and he wants nothing to do with someone else's seconds. (Her husband died their first year of marriage by being drunk and riding a horse and having an accident).  It isn't until the second half of the movie that he even begins to behave fairly decent to her.Joanna is a tough woman herself, she knows what she wants - and incredibly, she wants Heston. He decides to send her back to New Orleans, but first there is the matter of a seriously deadly mass of soldier ants threatening their existence.  They've amassed to a group that covers miles and they consume everything (everything!) in their enormous path - moving about 6 miles a day.  They've never been beaten in history, but Heston is going to stay and fight and Joanna refuses to leave.Who would've ever thought to make regular soldier ants the horrible beast for a movie? But leave it to nature to provide us with one of those ""truth is stranger than fiction"" scenarios.  I bet this was a big box office hit when released decades ago - and it's still worth watching today.  If you enjoy the older movies and Charlton Heston (he's practically baby faced in this one!) then you will enjoy this movie Paramount Pictures obviously spent a lot of money making.  Grab the popcorn, settle in and enjoy!  :-)",4,Wonderful early Heston - great old movie,1348790400,"09 28, 2012",2012,2335,"['Charlton', 'Heston', 'Christopher', 'Leiningen', 'hard', 'young', 'man', 'cocoa', 'plantation', 'middle', 'jungle', 'When', 'was', '19', 'built', 'dams', 'bridges', 'course', '4', 'years', 'took', 'rich', 'land', 'river', 'jungle', 'started', 'plantation', 'then', 'went', 'great', 'expense', 'build', 'lush', 'home', 'took', '7', 'years', 'finally', 'maybe', '30', 'got', 'more', 'less', 'mail', 'order', 'bride', 'Trusting', 'brother', 'New', 'Orleans', 'pick', 'out', 'woman', 'marry', 'wed', 'proxy.The', 'wife', 'Joanna', 'played', 'beautiful', 'talented', 'Eleanor', 'Parker', 'meet', 'husband', 'first', 'time', 'one', 'very', 'hard', 'handsome', 'man', 'who', 'total', 'rude', 'jerk', 'out', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'hit', 'jackpot', 'mail', 'order', 'bride', 'very', 'beautiful', 'educated', 'many', 'languages', 'plays', 'piano', 'etc', 'suspicious', 'trying', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'wrong', 'luck', ""n't"", 'that', 'good', 'Well', 'fault', 'virgin', 'been', 'married', 'info', 'brother', 'withheld', 'nothing', 'do', 'someone', 'else', 'seconds', 'husband', 'died', 'first', 'year', 'marriage', 'being', 'drunk', 'riding', 'horse', 'having', 'accident', ""n't"", 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'even', 'behave', 'fairly', 'decent', 'her.Joanna', 'tough', 'woman', 'what', 'incredibly', 'Heston', 'send', 'back', 'New', 'Orleans', 'first', 'matter', 'seriously', 'deadly', 'mass', 'soldier', 'ants', 'threatening', 'existence', ""'ve"", 'amassed', 'group', 'miles', 'consume', 'everything', 'everything', 'enormous', 'path', 'moving', '6', 'miles', 'day', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'beaten', 'history', 'Heston', 'going', 'stay', 'fight', 'Joanna', 'leave.Who', 'would', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'thought', 'make', 'regular', 'soldier', 'ants', 'horrible', 'beast', 'movie', 'leave', 'nature', 'provide', 'one', 'truth', 'stranger', 'fiction', 'scenarios', 'bet', 'was', 'big', 'box', 'office', 'hit', 'when', 'released', 'decades', 'still', 'worth', 'watching', 'today', 'enjoy', 'older', 'movies', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'practically', 'baby', 'faced', 'one', 'then', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'Paramount', 'Pictures', 'obviously', 'spent', 'lot', 'money', 'making', 'Grab', 'popcorn', 'settle', 'enjoy']",N/A

217673,A12X4M86C3LI91,6300215687,"Oldtechnohobbiest ""Mr. Nobody""","[2, 3]","Yea, I've got this one to.  First of all I didn't look up the credit scroll to make sure I got my spelling correct for some of these names and words...so bear with me.Point one:  I remember reading this short story when I was a freshman a zillion years ago...and if I'm not wrong I think I read the actual report the original story came from--I'm not sure.  But I'll tell you some of what I remember, it should make your viewing pleasure just a little more informed or at least a 'little' more entertaining.Point two:  I remember in the original story that was made from the original 'report' Lanigen used a fire engine filled with gasoline ""like a flamethrower"" to fight the ants with.  I remember a horse or cow got loose from the main compound and ran out amongest the ants and was devoured within thirty minutes.Point three:  I seem to remember...in the original report by a british or french soldier/officer on a gunboat/canoe (I don't remember which) they had been passing by villages for days that were abandoned...they didn't know why.  The boat or canoe was heading up stream to find out what was going on.  Somesort of fragmented reports had reached them so the government sent an expedition up river to investigate.  (Remember now, this is from my memory 45 years or more ago, and I only read it once.)  On the second or third day they decided to make a landing and check out the village.  (The guy who wrote this report went with them ashore).  One of the first things he spotted was movement to his left or right side...low to the ground--I guess living in the jungle your vision sharpens a lot.  Upon closer investigation he saw a large column of army ants race out from under or behind one of the huts and seemingly take cover under something.  As if hiding from him.  Futher investigation showed the village hastly abandoned with food still laying around as if dropped.  The natives or other people from the boat told him the village was deserted because the army ants were invading the area.  The more the man who wrote the report watched these ants in action the more he felt as if they were intelligent...that he couldn't shake the feeling when they ran out from under the hut and to cover they were doing so he wouldn't see them-like a military unit taking position for ambush.  I seem to remember his friends telling him army ants were like that.  They would try to encircle their prey or close it in on three sides then they would build up their forces by climbing on top of one another until they were as big as it, then fall on it...(hmmm, I don't know if I can believe that one.)Point four:  Once again, it seems like I remember this guy reporting they covered an area two miles wide and twenty miles long.Now, how much of this is real...beats me.  I'm sorry I don't really know the truth about it...maybe the next one of you who writes a review will look it up and find out.  I think the original story was entitled Lanigen and the Ants...I'm sorry but I don't remember the title of the original report.Anyway, about the movie;PROS:1.  It stars  Ellanor Parker (the cutie) Charlton Heston (the force of nature) and William Conrad.  That's a star.2.  Fine writing, that's a star.3.  Neat idea carried out fine with a few subplots that add to the neatness of the idea.  That's a star.4.  Well acted.  That's a star.5.  Well directed. That's a star.CONS:1.  I wish it had been half an hour longer...you know more, a little more here and there and some extra upriver time when they investigate the strange occurances there.Here's another point.  Have you ever heard anybody say they ""...didn't fail or quite, I was beaten...there's a difference.""  well this is the movie it came from.And finally:  Just incase you didn't know, this movie is about a plantation owner whose plantation is attacked, invaded, and literally eaten by invading army ants.  And, as a published Science Fiction novelist with only one award to his name, (don't worry, you've never heard of me) The Naked Jungle--no matter what anybody says--is not Science Fiction.  No, it is a fictional account of something that really happened...it is Fiction.  It may lean a little toward horror, but is not horror...It Is Fiction.So get out the popcorn and dogs, this is a serious movie, buy it.Bye!I'M back!  After I wrote this review I did a quick google search and read about fifty of the first listings including 'Teddy' Roosevelts 1919 expeditionary notes.  Despite most scientist playing down the army ant's swarm capabilities I did run across one news paper story from Brazil stating something to the effect of (this is not a quote)  ""...this town was invaded by army ants measuring one mile wide and one point eight miles deep.  All emergency personnel went out to meet them...not all returned.  Flame throwers were called in when the town was almost lost to the invaders.  The cheif of police is one of those who didn't come back...""  In all the science reports everybody seems to dodge around these stories about 'super colonies' were one colony picks up other colonies and pose a united front.  Hmmm, like I always say at this time--beats me.  BUT it sure makes a guy wonder.

Released in 1954, ""The Naked Jungle "" seems like two movies in one. The first half is a rather tedious soap-opera--the second half a genuinely exciting thriller that may have you itching and scratching by the time it's over !Charlton Heston plays Christopher Leiningen, owner of a South American cocoa plantation in 1901, who has decided that it's time to take a wife, and start producing heirs for the estate.His ""mail-order bride"" arrives, and it's gorgeous Eleanor Parker, dressed to kill and ready for life in the jungle with Mr. Heston. Unfortunately he knows nothing about women, and proceeds to treat her abominably. Maybe he needs glasses ? anger management courses ? A voluptuous, stunning redhead wants to settle down with him, and his attitude is rude and insulting.Why Ms. Parker doesn't take the next boat home will puzzle more than a few viewers !Luckily for all of us--except Mr. Heston--there is big trouble brewing in the jungle--a vast army of soldier ants, 20 miles long and 2 miles wide. Guess who owns the plantation right in their path ? Will Charlton cut and run ? Will a strong-willed woman abandon her man, even after he has treated her like dirt ?I think you know both answers ! Special effects are a bit primitive, but there are enough close-ups of the marauding ants to give you some idea of this extraordinary enemy. The final showdown between the ants and Mr. Heston is ""worth the price of admission""--and many thought that his ""disaster film period"" was in the 70s ! By the way, ants were popular ""villains"" in 1954--""Them"" came out the same year !I have to say that I had a problem with the sudden change in our hero's personality--at a certain point in the film, his attitude to Ms. Parker switches so suddenly and completely that it strains credulity--but don't blame Mr. Heston--he had a script to follow and , unlike many of his films, less than two hours to tell the story. I thought that Ms. Parker was excellent, although her character takes that ""stand by your man"" philosophy to a whole new level ! William Conrad--much slimmer than in his later ""Cannon"" role on television--gives able support as the local Commissioner, wondering why Charlton doesn't immediately thank his lucky stars for this goddess who wants to be with him.The full-screen, colour picture is vivid and beautiful--the sound--mono--the extras--zero.Again--an interesting, colourful relic from the 50s--but you have to be patient before the big-payoff.A very sad footnote, dated 6 April, 2008--Mr. Charlton Heston has passed away--he had been ill for some time.

I've never been fond of red ants since. In the 50's, this stuff was fodder for idiot kids like me. (""Them"" and ""Tarantula"" were really cool.)I since discovered that the real title was ""The Naked Jungle"", after seeing it again on TCM or AMC, whatever.""The Naked Jungle"" is soap opera from beginning to end, with the ""marabunta"" as a catalyst. The stars are interesting. I was never a fan of Charlton Heston (as an actor), but Eleanor Parker was quite lovely, being gorgeous & tough at the same time, not unlike her magnificent performance in ""Caged"". The ""marabunta"" is, apparently, a force to be reckoned with, and makes the Amazon all that more intriguing. The beliefs of Amazonian natives is somewhat brought out, so much more brought out in Hector Babenco's ""At Play in the Fields of the Lord"". It's hard to make comparisons, since the sensibilities of the 50's and the 90's have been broadened. ""The Naked Jungle"" is really one of the first disaster films. All of the most famous disaster films were soap opera (Towering Inferno, Airport, Poseidon Adventure, etc.). In some ways, this is a trend-setter.

Surprisingly it is still not a well known film and is largely forgotten as an early Charlton Heston vechicle. It has many similiarities in theme to Paramount's ""Elephant Walk"" starring Elizabeth Taylor and Peter Finch and even has a cross over of cast in the talented Abraham Sofaer who appears as an Indian manservant in both films. While the other film had elephants as its main point of interest the little creatures in this film are far more deadly and make for a much scarier scenerio whereby the dreaded South American soldier ants literally eat anything that moves, thus having a lot more potential for an exciting climax to the story.Indeed exciting and well made are two terms best used to describe this film. It tells the story of an isolated and fairly anti social self made young man Christopher Leiningen who has carved out an empire for himself on a coffee plantation far up the Amazon river in South America. To continue his empire he seeks a wife and advertises for a bride. His brother in New Orleans finds him the perfect woman in the form of Eleanor Parker who is refined, well educated and spunky with a mind of her own. The first part of the film shows their clash of wills and their eventual growing respect for each other prior to the last part of the story where their whole existence is threatened by a moving mountain of deadly soldier ants that threaten to wipe out everything in their path. This makes for the really exciting finale to the film which I wont reveal for those of you who have not seen the film yet.Charlton Heston and Eleanor Parker make a great couple in this film and their screen chemistry is really electric here. Parker, still best known as the Baroness in ""The Sound Of Music"" brings to her role the rare combination of refinement and gutsiness which contrasts beautifully with Heston's no nonsense man of few words. During the more leisurely first half of the film the two alternately clash, in particular after Christopher learns that Joanna has been previously married and is thus in his mind soiled goods, and then develop feelings for each other while learning more about themselvesin the process.The tone of the film changes dramatically in the second half and what we witness then are the really superb special effects and production values after the killer ants begin their march on the plantation. This part of the film contains some quite horrifying and disturbing scenes that even today are not for the squeamish. It is all done in a highly believable and vivid manner and the climax that sees the flooding of the plantation has rarely been equalled in terms of special effects.""The Naked Jungle"" benefits greatly from the beautiful on location photography employed and the vivid colour which really brings the South American locale alive. The film can be enjoyed on a number of levels, firstly as a well acted drama that for once shows a strong ,intelligent and self assured female lead bouncing off the lead male and secondly as a rivetting adventure tale filled with exciting and eye popping special effects that create quite a frightening vision. It has it all, action, romance, terror , and excitement which is often hard to find in current films.

Forget all that mushy stuff, I wanted to see Man vs. Nature! But the first time I saw it again as an adult, I realized with delight that Nature included human nature as well, and that the intense emotional & sexual struggle between the two leads was just as compelling as the boy's own adventure that had captivated me as a child.Since then I've seen the film many times, and I'm still fascinated by the human dynamic: Charlton Heston as the domineering man who's built a stronghold out of the wilderness, its walls symbolic of his own personal walls, protecting him from his unrealized but demanding drives for complete manhood; and Eleanor Parker as the gorgeous, strong-minded young widow who's willing to travel thousands of miles to take a chance on happiness, and who's more than a match for her husband-by-proxy.Heston is sometimes called stiff & wooden as an actor, even though he was always capable of more subtlety than that when given a chance. But here he uses that quality to depict the idealized man that a young boy created in order to survive, with just enough of the self-doubt & insecurity showing through the rugged self-image to let us know he's ready to change & grow. All his life he's been fighting, always building, always busy -- but we learn he that he reads poetry & yearns for a family, even if he doesn't quite know how to go about it.Enter Eleanor Parker as the bride he essentially bought by mail, someone who turns out to be a flesh & blood woman rather than an idealized ornament. Really, she's so stunning that she could easily have coasted on her looks alone; but Parker was always a gifted actress who used her beauty without ever solely depending on it. She sees through Heston's facade immediately, and challenges him at every turn without ever becoming cruel or mocking. If anything, there's pity & compassion in her approach; she's sees something good & strong in Heston that simply needs her encouragement to develop.And does it ever! The scene where she asks him to apply the insect repellent to her bare shoulders & back is just plain sexy as hell; she's quietly saucy & knowing, using her strengths to match his as he slowly becomes aware of her intentions. I love that slight, stiff-backed pause after he hastily exists her hut -- he looks as if he's in desperate need of an ice-cold shower!But what about those ants?The story of the approaching horde of soldier ants is a slow-burning fuse, an atmosphere of something ominous & terrible always looming in the background. Even as Heston & Parker engage in their dance of desire & denial, the mounting sense of danger grows & grows. Wisely the film doesn't even mention the ants until well into the story, using the native name ""marabunta"" instead, which gains in threatening power with each repetition. We've already learned of headhunters, casual death, countless rare diseases -- but all of that pales before the horror of the unstoppable ants.The final battle brings all of the story threads to a climax ... and I use that word with deliberate precision. It's thrilling, suspenseful, frightening, and finally triumphant. What Heston loses materially is nothing compared to what he gains as a man. In defending his stronghold against the dark, implacable forces of Nature, he comes to terms with those same forces within himself.
