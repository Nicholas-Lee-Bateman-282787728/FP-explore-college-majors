Though the story is not built around Christmas, it has a Christmas play in it so it has become a Seasonal favorite of mine.  I wouldn't classify this as a kid's movie even though the main characters are pre-teens.  Don't expect to see much of Jim Carey.  He's the narrator and doesn't show up until the very end of the story.  I thought it was really cute and got a lot of mileage out of it.  But in all fairness, two of my friends, who apparently are not given to inspirational-type stories, didn't like it -- which surprised me. They can write their own reviews. :>)  In the meantime, occasionally,I want to disconnect by pulling this off the shelf and watching it -- even though it's not Christmas.",5,Heartwarming,1177113600,"04 21, 2007",2007,731,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'story', 'not', 'built', 'Christmas', 'Christmas', 'play', 'become', 'Seasonal', 'favorite', 'mine', 'would', ""n't"", 'classify', 'kid', 'movie', 'even', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'pre-teens', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'see', 'much', 'Jim', 'Carey', 'narrator', ""n't"", 'show', 'up', 'very', 'end', 'story', 'thought', 'was', 'really', 'cute', 'got', 'lot', 'mileage', 'fairness', 'two', 'friends', 'who', 'apparently', 'are', 'not', 'given', 'inspirational-type', 'stories', 'did', ""n't"", 'surprised', 'can', 'write', 'own', 'reviews', '>', 'meantime', 'occasionally', 'want', 'disconnect', 'pulling', 'shelf', 'watching', 'even', 'not', 'Christmas']",N/A

Simon is small, but his heart remains massive. The film starts with the hidden star (don't wanna spoil it) narrating why Simon was crowd surfing in his sunday school room. I tell you this movie is hilarious. There is a scene that is so funny that I thought I was gonna explode! Let me just say, justice is done. Simon has a best friend (Joseph Mazello-Tim, from Jurassic ) who remains with him through thick and thin. Why should you get it?? Simple. Right when you think you get the mystery of Simons friend, a curve is thrown (no pun intended). And on top of this Simon is on an all out retro-mecha mission for God. He doesn't know what it is, but it's there just the same. When everything unfoolds, and when the tears are shed (mostly from laughing), you are gonna love this kid. Ashley Judd is a beauty.

The book is a multi-level story covering many years and much growth and change in the two main characters, Owen and Joe. The story is so engrossing that I cried at the end, which I haven't done in many years of reading. I cared about the characters, I cared about the decisions and indecision, I cared about their struggles and their day to day ramblings.Simon Birch does not do the story justice. As is typical the meat of the story is wiped out, and a pseudo-mythology put in its place. Yes Owen Meany (renamed Simon Birch for the movie) becomes a hero, but not at such a young age. He must suffer and grow and learn before death takes him and not in the peaceful glow of a hospital.  Joe doesn't end up married with a son, and a smug, rememberance of his best friend. He has been marred by his life and is still dealing with it.  Why is it that screenwriters think movie goers don't want to engage with the story and walk away thinking about what was presented to them?If you want something that is engaging, makes you think, cry and evaluate how you're living your life, then get the book and forget this Hollywood fantasy.",2,Very poor adaptation of the book,1100476800,"11 15, 2004",2004,1245,"['Having', 'been', 'astounded', 'A', 'Prayer', 'Owen', 'Meany', 'was', 'hoping', 'movie', 'would', 'capture', 'spirit', 'book', 'book', 'multi-level', 'story', 'covering', 'many', 'years', 'much', 'growth', 'change', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'Owen', 'Joe', 'story', 'so', 'engrossing', 'cried', 'end', 'have', ""n't"", 'done', 'many', 'years', 'reading', 'cared', 'characters', 'cared', 'decisions', 'indecision', 'cared', 'struggles', 'day', 'day', 'ramblings.Simon', 'Birch', 'not', 'do', 'story', 'justice', 'typical', 'meat', 'story', 'wiped', 'out', 'pseudo-mythology', 'put', 'place', 'Yes', 'Owen', 'Meany', 'renamed', 'Simon', 'Birch', 'movie', 'hero', 'not', 'young', 'age', 'must', 'suffer', 'grow', 'learn', 'death', 'not', 'peaceful', 'glow', 'hospital', 'Joe', ""n't"", 'end', 'up', 'married', 'son', 'smug', 'rememberance', 'best', 'friend', 'been', 'marred', 'life', 'still', 'dealing', 'Why', 'think', 'movie', 'goers', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'engage', 'story', 'walk', 'away', 'thinking', 'what', 'was', 'presented', 'want', 'something', 'engaging', 'think', 'cry', 'evaluate', 'how', ""'re"", 'living', 'life', 'then', 'get', 'book', 'forget', 'Hollywood', 'fantasy']",N/A

81560,AUHG8KSHI529U,0788815466,Craig Matteson,"[6, 7]","In discussing the story, the makers say that it was suggested by John Irving's ""A Prayer for Owen Meany"" (which is one of the Irving novels I was actually able to read and enjoy).  This movie has only the broad strokes of the novel.  It is far more sentimental than the book and the plot is quite different in detail and affect.  So, if you want to see a movie of the novel, this is NOT it.The real issue with this movie is its sentimentality.  Does it let itself become too sweet?  Does it go after the tears too directly via manipulation rather than earning them with something of real power.  In my view, given all the movies nowadays where I find myself disliking every character in it with plots made with cookie cutters, a little sentimentality is not a fatal flaw.  The movie works because of the way Ian Michael Smith is able to show us that Simon Birch is intelligent, defiant, and so full of faith that he is indomitable.  All three foot one inch of him.  It also works because of the way Joseph Mazzello is able to make Joe Wenteworth into something more complex than a simple outcast adolescent. These two actors are able to portray and friendship that has its joys and stresses as the events of the movie unfold in a way that is memorable and makes the movie worthwhile by itself.Then there is the angelic character of Joe's mom, Rebecca, played by Ashley Judd.  She is too perfect for this world, but that is, I think, because she is already just a memory.  Judd plays the character perfectly and it is the story itself that burdens the character with just a bit too much sweetness.  Oliver Platt is good in his role as the father replacement for Joe, but he is willing to stand off to the side and let the relationship take its course.  Yes, it is an idealized character.  I don't want to talk more about the other characters, although they are well acted for what they are given.  The ""bad guys"" in this film are bad in a refreshing way, though.  Rather than being evil, they are just weak, foolish, and stupid like the rest of us.  Their ""badness"" comes from real human weakness rather than a bad heart.I also enjoyed the humor in this movie. The scene with the turtle-doves and the Christmas play is really wonderfully memorable.  However, the key is the way Simon and Joe bond and their relationship.  Joe has a tough life in a normal way.  Simon has a life so bad that it is something only the strongest could survive.  And yet, Simon triumphs.  So, that is a kind of goodness that I am not too cynical or ironically detached to enjoy.I hope you can also find the enjoyment in this movie without being embarrassed.",4,"A movie where you can actually like the characters!

81561,A39L5T2ZQZ52FN,0788815466,David Michael Cohen,"[5, 11]","Simon Birch tries to be a heartwarming drama, and in some small ways suceeds.  The two main characters are Simon (a boy with congenital dwarfism) and his best friend.  A various points in the movie they have deep conversations, which are touching and  thought provoking, without the excessive sentiment and emotionality that tends to characterize (and ruin) most modern dramas.  Unfortunately, there is little else in the movie to recommend it.  For one thing, Simon is difficult to like.  Half of the movie he complains about how no one takes him seriously because of his small stature.  For the other half he is acting like a jerk, swearing at people, goosing girls, flipping people off, and all the time you can practically hear the director off screen saying &quot;No, it's not rude, its funny because he's so short.&quot;  Sorry, but a jerk is a jerk, no matter how tall he is.  Also, the film's &quot;dramatic highlights&quot; are so unrealistic and off-the-wall they seem absurd compared to the overall serious tone of the movie, like comic relief you're not supposed to laugh at.  A prime example is Simon's objection to doughnuts being served at a church reception.  The audience is given no clue as to what he is objecting to (where in the bible are doughnuts and social activites among church members forbidden?).

All he wants people to know is that he is the same as everyone else and should be treated the same way as other people.&quot;Simon Birch&quot; has great humor involved in the storylines that got me laughing constantly.  On the other hand, there are VERY emotional parts to this film and every made me shed a few tears.  This movie should be in everyone's top 10 list.I found no faults in the film and thought everyone scene shown was a valid lesson to teenagers.  What I liked about this movie was the relationship between the two friends and even through their differences, they are still seen as two human beings.The parents of the friends of Simon Birch's doesn't approve of Simon and doesn't like him for what he looks like.  His friend tries not to care what they think as he keeps their friendship strong.

Not  because of how they look.I enjoyed watching Simon stump Reverend Russell in  church,and when he would sit in the corner during Sunday School.Simon knew  more about faith than his teacher and the minister combined.Also,I  noticed alot of criticism because this movie was not a copy of &quot;A  Prayer For Owen Meaney.&quot;You're right.It's not.But think about this for  a second.This movie would be rated R if they showed a guy getting his arms  blown off by a grenade.For those of you that want to bite my head off and  jump down my throat because,when you read this for the first time,interpret  it as me criticizing John Irving's novel,I am not being critical of the  book.I'm just stating a fact.Also,it clearly says in the beginning and at  the end of Simon Birch that it was SUGGESTED BY,NOT based on the  novel.These two are different in some ways,but they are both excellent  stories.My email address is posted with my second review of this movie,so  feel free to email me with any comments you may have about my review,or the  book,or the movie.",5,I give this movie 5 million stars.,945475200,"12 18, 1999",1999,1852,"['are', 'probably', 'wondering', 'man', 'obsessed', 'movie', 'third', 'review', 'god', 'sake.Well', ""'m"", 'not', 'obsessed', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'cry', 'when', 'watch', 'days', 'watch', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'thinking', 'Joe', 'Wenteworth', 'Simon', 'Birch.I', 'LOVED', 'movie', 'even', 'will', 'probably', 'never', 'happen', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'Simon', 'Birch', '2in', 'Simon', 'would', 'come', 'back', 'life', 'two', 'would', 'finish', 'school', 'live', 'be', 'least', '80', 'years', 'old.Simon', 'was', 'too', 'young', 'die.I', 'know', 'just', 'movie', 'when', 'saw', 'Simon', 'Birch', 'die', 'was', 'almost', 'close', 'friend', 'had', 'just', 'died.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'weird', 'way', 'feel.This', 'movie', 'accepting', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'Not', 'how', 'look.I', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'Simon', 'stump', 'Reverend', 'Russell', 'church', 'when', 'would', 'sit', 'corner', 'Sunday', 'School.Simon', 'knew', 'more', 'faith', 'teacher', 'minister', 'combined.Also', 'noticed', 'alot', 'criticism', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'copy', 'quot', 'A', 'Prayer', 'Owen', 'Meaney.', 'quot', ""'re"", 'not.But', 'think', 'second.This', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'rated', 'R', 'showed', 'guy', 'getting', 'arms', 'blown', 'off', 'grenade.For', 'want', 'bite', 'head', 'jump', 'down', 'throat', 'when', 'read', 'first', 'time', 'interpret', 'criticizing', 'John', 'Irving', 'novel', 'am', 'not', 'being', 'critical', 'book.I', ""'m"", 'just', 'stating', 'fact.Also', 'clearly', 'beginning', 'end', 'Simon', 'Birch', 'was', 'SUGGESTED', 'BY', 'NOT', 'based', 'novel.These', 'two', 'are', 'different', 'ways', 'are', 'excellent', 'stories.My', 'email', 'address', 'posted', 'second', 'review', 'movie', 'feel', 'free', 'email', 'comments', 'may', 'have', 'review', 'book', 'movie']",N/A

Simpley for the sake of thequality of this film's acting, in and of itself.To begin, what I speak of is the 1990s and 21st century phenomenon of Joe Mazzello. This film is the quintessential example of his always consistent and steady acting capabilities.  He and Ian Michael Smith (aka, Simon)carried this film beautifully in addition to TOP-notch performances by the superb David Strathairn, Oliver Platt, and Ashley Judd.Joe Mazzello and Ian Michael Smith forge a chemistry in this film that is PALPABLE to a high degree!  Make no mistake.  It is a boy friendship as REAL and moving as the on-screen friendship between Spencer Tracey and Katherine Hepburn.  You could almost feel the chemistry jump off the screen.  Oh yes.Joe has continued to act and also is forging his path in Directing, whereas Ian has been enrolled at Massachusetts' inimitable MIT.  The scene of their embrace prior to the church bus leaving for the weekend trip was as REAL as it gets.  Joe's motto about acting is:  ""Just make it look REAL!""

Rooney,"[1, 1]","Simon Birch is about an outsider, a pre-teen dwarf living in a gorgeous, way-too-pretty northern New England town; he's an object of ridicule who thinks he has a destiny to fulfill for God. He was put on this earth for a purpose, to do God's will at a key point in his life. His parents have rejected him. Another family has taken him to their hearts. Simon falls for the family's single mother, the town's beauty, who worships him. Her son befriends Simon, and the two become great buddies. The boys are real, the mother is almost too good to be true, and her devoted boy friend becomes a loyal pal to the boys. Simon is an oversexed little devil who keenly appreciates a woman or girl's physical attributes.Simon is the left-out who has the guts to publicly criticize his pastor because he is a true believer while the pastor may have strayed from faith and belief. The acting is outstanding. The flick has an idealized, somewhat Disneyesque cinematography. It is sentimental, a tear-jerker, but has a heartwarming quality. Simon's parents are caricatures as is the Sunday school teacher. It is based upon a John Irving work which explains its heart-tugging aspects.The movie proves that physical abnormality may mask the pure soul within. Some things in the movie are too predictable, but it provides a lesson in humanity for the viewer.

Simply put- the movie is brilliant.Ian Michael Smith plays Simon Birch very well- although I think his part was so well written that it would have been hard not to play in well.  But the real star of this movie, in my opinion, is Joseph Mazzello.  Joe can take any part that is written and make it his own and in many cases make the movie- it's no wonder Speilberg changed the kids in Jurassic Park so that Joe could play in it.  However, this movie out of all of his (yes, even including The Cure) is probably his most well-acted.  His maturity shows in this movie compared to say, The River Wild.  It is really a shame that we haven't seen anything from Joe since this.For Joe Mazzello fans, this and the Cure are must owns.  However, this movie appeals to a wide audience (someone has made the comment they couldn't figure out whether this was meant to appeal to adults or kids- I say both) and would be a good family film if you are willing to look past a small amount of launguage and a couple sexual comments/situations that are mainly just to show what kids are like for those that have forgot (I'd say most kids above 11 or so could easily handle this).",5,Strongly Recommended,970790400,"10 6, 2000",2000,1392,"['Simon', 'Birch', 'one', 'movies', 'yes', 'have', 'couple', 'things', 'place', 'little', 'launguage', 'sexual', 'innuendos', 'end', 'movie', 'are', ""n't"", 'thinking', 'stuff', 'are', 'reminded', 'Simply', 'put-', 'movie', 'brilliant.Ian', 'Michael', 'Smith', 'Simon', 'Birch', 'very', 'well-', 'think', 'part', 'was', 'so', 'well', 'written', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'hard', 'not', 'play', 'well', 'real', 'star', 'movie', 'opinion', 'Joseph', 'Mazzello', 'Joe', 'can', 'take', 'part', 'written', 'make', 'own', 'many', 'cases', 'make', 'movie-', 'wonder', 'Speilberg', 'changed', 'kids', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'Joe', 'could', 'play', 'However', 'movie', 'yes', 'even', 'including', 'Cure', 'probably', 'most', 'well-acted', 'maturity', 'movie', 'compared', 'say', 'River', 'Wild', 'really', 'shame', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'anything', 'Joe', 'this.For', 'Joe', 'Mazzello', 'fans', 'Cure', 'are', 'must', 'However', 'movie', 'appeals', 'wide', 'audience', 'someone', 'made', 'comment', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'was', 'meant', 'appeal', 'adults', 'kids-', 'say', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'family', 'film', 'are', 'willing', 'look', 'small', 'amount', 'launguage', 'couple', 'sexual', 'comments/situations', 'are', 'mainly', 'just', 'show', 'what', 'kids', 'are', 'have', 'forgot', ""'d"", 'say', 'most', 'kids', '11', 'so', 'could', 'easily', 'handle']",N/A

Simon Birch plays a dwarf who thinks that god had a ""plan"" for him to do something big; he thinks he is a miracle child. Joe is really the only person who sees Simon as a normal child. He is really nice to Simon and they always hang out with each other. They get into all sorts of trouble with one another.Personally, my favorite part of the movie is when Joe and Simon sneak into their school after hours and get into some trouble. Then, the janitors Bull Mastiff finds them and goes up to Simon. The height difference is hilarious.On a cold winter day, an accident happens that will affect everyone for the worst. At this part of the movie, I cried and cried and cried. It is most definitely the saddest part of the movie.This film is based on a fiction novel called A Prayer for Owen Meany by John Irving. It was originally a story about a small person who was in the war and the struggles Owen Meany goes through.It is a heart-warming, humorous tale that makes me cry every time I see it. It will always be one of my favorites and it is a great movie. The lesson in this movie is not to judge a book by its cover, or in this case, not to judge a boy by his height.

While it's true that the plot of Irving's novel is oversimplified, one has to remember that a PG rating wouldn't be appropriate for a more faithful adaptation of it. I hated the character of Simon Birch from the beginning; as one other reviewer noted, he's an all-around jerk, rude, foul-mouthed, and unsympathetic to the max. However, let's not forget that the screenwriters changed the characters' names for a reason, namely, this film has to be judged separately from it's inspiration. The movie itself is not as cloying as one might expect, given the main character (Sinon's) crassness, and ultra-cynical perspective on life. In fact, he is less of a Christ-figure than his novel counterpart, less believable in the role. They didn't even make an effort to duplicate Owen's voice. But besides all these complaints, the dnding is a somewhat more realistic than that of the novel, although less powerful. It's still touching. But to all those reviewers who took issue with this movie simply because it departed so sharply and in so many places from the book, I say, &quot;Judge this with a different scale.&quot; It's been altered for a reason.",3,"overly melodramatic, but...",1076716800,"02 14, 2004",2004,1305,"['just', 'finished', 'novel', 'quot', 'A', 'Prayer', 'Owen', 'Meany', 'quot', 'only', 'yesterday', 'thought', ""'d"", 'write', 'review', 'movie', 'saw', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'true', 'plot', 'Irving', 'novel', 'oversimplified', 'remember', 'PG', 'rating', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'appropriate', 'more', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'hated', 'character', 'Simon', 'Birch', 'beginning', 'one', 'other', 'reviewer', 'noted', 'all-around', 'jerk', 'rude', 'foul-mouthed', 'unsympathetic', 'max', 'However', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'screenwriters', 'changed', 'characters', 'names', 'reason', 'namely', 'film', 'be', 'judged', 'separately', 'inspiration', 'movie', 'not', 'as', 'cloying', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'given', 'main', 'character', 'Sinon', 'crassness', 'ultra-cynical', 'perspective', 'life', 'fact', 'less', 'Christ-figure', 'novel', 'counterpart', 'less', 'believable', 'role', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'make', 'effort', 'duplicate', 'Owen', 'voice', 'complaints', 'dnding', 'somewhat', 'more', 'realistic', 'novel', 'less', 'powerful', 'still', 'touching', 'reviewers', 'who', 'took', 'issue', 'movie', 'simply', 'departed', 'so', 'sharply', 'so', 'many', 'places', 'book', 'say', 'quot', 'Judge', 'different', 'scale.', 'quot', 'been', 'altered', 'reason']",N/A

No bigger than a baby bird, doctors predicted he would never last the night. But he did. Then they said he would never last a week. But he did. Eventually, Simon grew into a little boy, fortified by the staunch belief that God had made him small for a reason, that God not only had a special plan for him but that he was going to be a hero. His story is related by a narrator, Simon's best friend as a child, now grown-up. We only see him twice - at the beginning and at the end - but it's this character, played with incredibly sensitivity by Jim Carrey (who curiously gets no screen credit) that bookends the narrative. Veteran screenwriter and now first-time director Mark Steven Johnson has created a cinematic fable, suggested by John Irving's ""A Prayer for Owen Meany."" Since the story begins in a graveyard in Gravestown, Maine, by the tombstone of ""Simon Birch,"" we know that the pivotal character died at the age of 12, so the only dramatic tension revolves around when, where, and how this tragedy occurred. The problem with the structure of the film is that it's so obviously melodramatic and manipulative. In the title role, Ian Michael Smith, who is afflicted with a rare enzyme disorder, Morquio Syndrome, compensates for his ""vertical challenge"" with a truly magical display of talent. And Joseph Mazzello delivers a truly remarkable performance as Simon's best friend (the young Jim Carrey) whose single mother, played by Ashley Judd, refuses to reveal the name of his father, thus providing the curious boys with an ongoing mystery.

Joe Wenteworth (Joseph Mazzello) is your typical twelve-year-old boy in search for the identity of his father, a secret his young, beautiful mother, Rebecca Wenteworth (Ashley Judd) has been keeping from him ever since he was born. Simon Birch (Ian Michael Smith) is also twelve years old, but he's much shorter than most twelve-year-olds. In fact, he is a dwarf (or midgit) who had a heart defect when he was born. Simon's parents don't care about him at all, and so he usually spends most of his time with Joe's family. Everyone in town makes fun of Simon because of his short size and unique personality, always insisting that God has a plan for everyone and that he will one day become a hero, as God planned for him. Jim Carrey narrates the story as the adult Joe. His role surprised me a lot because Jim Carrey usually plays wacky, hilarious roles instead of serious ones. Rebecca also ends up bringing home a boyfriend, Ben (Oliver Pratt), who the young Joe dislikes but learns to like him in the end.SIMON BIRCH is just a really amazing, inspiring film. All the actors are at their best - each one deserves Oscars! The real star of the film is Joseph Mazzello, who has always been a favorite actor of mine. I'm waiting for him to make another movie. Hopefully he will, soon! Ian Michael Smith is perfect in his debut film role. Ashley Judd has never played her part so well, and Oliver Pratt is also amazing. Even Jim Carrey is really good! The storyline and script are solid and deliver a very powerful message. I just cannot describe how much I love this film. The scenery is breath-taking, too! I strongly recommend that you go and rent this film. Better yet, buy it! You will not be disappointed.",5,Touching and heartwarming!,999993600,"09 9, 2001",2001,2085,"['loved', 'SIMON', 'BIRCH', 'So', 'far', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'twice', 'once', 'theaters', 'once', 'video', 'times', 'gave', 'watery', 'eyes', 'end', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'cry', 'when', 'watching', 'movies', 'film', 'really', 'sad', 'then', 'might', 'just', 'get', 'watery', 'eyes', 'closet', 'crying', 'get', 'when', 'watching', 'movies.SIMON', 'BIRCH', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'best', 'friends', 'growing', 'up', ""'60s"", 'Joe', 'Wenteworth', 'Joseph', 'Mazzello', 'typical', 'twelve-year-old', 'boy', 'search', 'identity', 'father', 'secret', 'young', 'beautiful', 'mother', 'Rebecca', 'Wenteworth', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'been', 'keeping', 'ever', 'was', 'born', 'Simon', 'Birch', 'Ian', 'Michael', 'Smith', 'also', 'twelve', 'years', 'old', 'much', 'shorter', 'most', 'twelve-year-olds', 'fact', 'dwarf', 'midgit', 'who', 'had', 'heart', 'defect', 'when', 'was', 'born', 'Simon', 'parents', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'so', 'usually', 'most', 'time', 'Joe', 'family', 'Everyone', 'town', 'fun', 'Simon', 'short', 'size', 'unique', 'personality', 'always', 'insisting', 'God', 'plan', 'everyone', 'will', 'one', 'day', 'become', 'hero', 'God', 'planned', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'story', 'adult', 'Joe', 'role', 'surprised', 'lot', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'usually', 'wacky', 'hilarious', 'roles', 'instead', 'serious', 'ones', 'Rebecca', 'also', 'up', 'bringing', 'home', 'boyfriend', 'Ben', 'Oliver', 'Pratt', 'who', 'young', 'Joe', 'dislikes', 'like', 'end.SIMON', 'BIRCH', 'just', 'really', 'amazing', 'inspiring', 'film', 'actors', 'are', 'best', 'one', 'Oscars', 'real', 'star', 'film', 'Joseph', 'Mazzello', 'who', 'always', 'been', 'favorite', 'actor', 'mine', ""'m"", 'waiting', 'make', 'movie', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'soon', 'Ian', 'Michael', 'Smith', 'perfect', 'debut', 'film', 'role', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'never', 'played', 'part', 'so', 'well', 'Oliver', 'Pratt', 'also', 'amazing', 'Even', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'really', 'good', 'storyline', 'script', 'are', 'solid', 'deliver', 'very', 'powerful', 'message', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'describe', 'how', 'much', 'love', 'film', 'scenery', 'breath-taking', 'too', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'go', 'rent', 'film', 'Better', 'yet', 'buy', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A

FIRST OF ALL, FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO KEEP COMPLAINING ABOUT THE MOVIE BEING SO DIFFERENT FROM THE BOOK, PAY ATTENTION TO THE OPENING CREDITS WHERE IT SAYS 'SUGGESTED BY......' IT IS NOT BASED ON IRVING'S BOOK, ONLY LOOSELY USES SOME BITS AND PIECES OF IT. I READ THE BOOK AFTER WATCHING THE MOVIE AND DISLIKED THE BOOK. AS FOR THE MOVIE, THE FIRST TIME I SAW IT I HAD MISSED THE FIRST 10 MINUTES SO I WAS TOTALLY UNPREPARED FOR THE EVENTS THAT UNFOLDED. AND LET ME TELL YOU I DIDN'T JUST CRY I SOBBED. I WENT THROUGH A WHOLE BOX OF KLEENIX. BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS THE PURITY OF SIMON'S FAITH AND THE DEEP FRIENDSHIP HE SHARES WITH JOE. THE CAST IS EXCELLENT-THE BEAUTIFUL ASHLEY JUDD IS WONDERFUL IN HER CHARACTER'S HANDLING OF SIMON, OLIVER PLATT IS EXCELLENT AS THE KIND AND CARING BEN, JOE MAZELLO IS EXTRAORDINARY AND IAN MICHAEL SMITH-WHAT CAN I SAY? FOR HIS FIRST(AND ONLY EVER) ROLE HE BLEW ME AWAY. HE WAS FUNNY AND SWEET AND DEVILISH AND ENDEARING AND SO FULL OF FAITH HE PUTS EVERYONE ELSE TO SHAME, EVEN THE PREACHER. JIM CARREY WAS WONDERFUL IN A NON-COMEDIC ROLE. THIS IS A MOVIE THAT WILL MAKE YOU LAUGH, CRY,AND REMEMBER THE SIMPLE DAYS OF INNOCENCE.YES, THERE ARE A FEW CURSE WORDS, AND A FEW SLIGHT VULGARITIES TYPICAL OF BOYS THAT AGE BUT NONE OF MY FRIENDS WHOM I'VE SENT IT TO TOOK ANY OFFENSE TO IT. IT'S BEAUTIFULLY FILMED, GORGEOUSLY MUSICALLY SCORED, AND ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL STORIES OF FRIENDSHIP AND FAITH THAT I'VE EVER SEEN. FOR THOSE WHO LOVE THE BOOK, HEY, DON'T WATCH THE MOVIE. FOR THOSE WHO HAVE WATCHED THE MOVIE, DON'T READ THE BOOK BECAUSE THEY'RE NOTHING ALIKE. BUT IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A MOVIE THAT IS BEAUTIFULLY ACTED, TUGS AT YOUR HEARTSTRINGS AND BRINGS BACK THAT AGE OF INNOCENCE THAT IS TOTALLY LOST IN THIS WORLD TODAY, BUY THE MOVIE.

I catch a lot of films in first run but this one went under my radar.  I had scarcely heard of it but picked it up on a lark, perhaps because it had a Siskel/ Ebert 2 thumbs up recommend on the cover. Having watched it I came in to read how others reacted to it and I am happy to see so many people have also fallen in love with the film. Perhaps understandably, though I can't relate, the few people that seem to dislike the film are people who have read the book and some professional critics. I can't add much that hasn't already been said but I found the film totally charming. The music score is lush and perfectly enhances the mood and tone of the film. Ashley Judd is at her very best looking gorgeous and so sweet and kind you can completely understand how Simon could have a crush on her.  Oliver Platt turns in a winning performance as the kid-smart  boyfriend. While Simon is given title billing the film is really about two friends whose stories are given equal weight.  Simon Birches death is an important part of the film but isn't the core. There are emotional moments of all sorts throughout the film.  So while the ending was emotional, it wasn't an unnecessary tag on death like the one in Pay if Forward. We know Simon is going to die as the story starts out in a cemetary. How that comes about kept me curious. Anyway it was a great experience to pick up a film you don't expect to be so good.  I am glad I caught it. I thought it was kind of neat to discover Jim Carrey requested that his name be removed from the film because he was concerned people would get the wrong idea about the kind of film it was if his name was associated with it.  He plays an characteristically tender small role as the &quot;Wonder Years&quot; style narrator who bookends opening and closing of the film and does such a nice job it is almost impossible to imagine him as the same guy who played Ace Ventura.",5,A hidden treasure,993772800,"06 29, 2001",2001,1986,"['rare', 'find', 'film', 'video', 'store', 'real', 'discovery', 'catch', 'lot', 'films', 'first', 'run', 'one', 'went', 'radar', 'had', 'scarcely', 'heard', 'picked', 'up', 'lark', 'perhaps', 'had', 'Siskel/', 'Ebert', '2', 'thumbs', 'up', 'recommend', 'cover', 'Having', 'watched', 'came', 'read', 'how', 'others', 'reacted', 'am', 'happy', 'see', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'also', 'fallen', 'love', 'film', 'Perhaps', 'understandably', 'ca', ""n't"", 'relate', 'few', 'people', 'seem', 'dislike', 'film', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'professional', 'critics', 'ca', ""n't"", 'add', 'much', ""n't"", 'already', 'been', 'said', 'found', 'film', 'totally', 'charming', 'music', 'score', 'lush', 'perfectly', 'mood', 'tone', 'film', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'very', 'best', 'looking', 'gorgeous', 'so', 'sweet', 'kind', 'can', 'completely', 'understand', 'how', 'Simon', 'could', 'have', 'crush', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'winning', 'performance', 'kid-smart', 'boyfriend', 'Simon', 'given', 'title', 'billing', 'film', 'really', 'two', 'friends', 'stories', 'are', 'given', 'equal', 'weight', 'Simon', 'Birches', 'death', 'important', 'part', 'film', ""n't"", 'core', 'are', 'emotional', 'moments', 'sorts', 'film', 'So', 'ending', 'was', 'emotional', 'was', ""n't"", 'unnecessary', 'tag', 'death', 'one', 'Pay', 'Forward', 'know', 'Simon', 'going', 'die', 'story', 'out', 'cemetary', 'How', 'about', 'kept', 'curious', 'Anyway', 'was', 'great', 'experience', 'pick', 'up', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'so', 'good', 'am', 'glad', 'caught', 'thought', 'was', 'kind', 'neat', 'discover', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'requested', 'name', 'be', 'removed', 'film', 'was', 'concerned', 'people', 'would', 'get', 'wrong', 'idea', 'kind', 'film', 'was', 'name', 'was', 'associated', 'characteristically', 'tender', 'small', 'role', 'quot', 'Wonder', 'Years', 'quot', 'style', 'narrator', 'who', 'opening', 'closing', 'film', 'nice', 'job', 'almost', 'impossible', 'imagine', 'same', 'guy', 'who', 'played', 'Ace', 'Ventura']",N/A

Sentimental but never maudlin, triumphant but never contrived, tragic but somehow never depressing, ""Simon Birch"" is a drama every bit as riveting as any horror movie, thriller, or actioneer, and at times reaching heights of comedy to match anything John Cleese has ever do done, from ""Fawlty Towers"" to ""Fierce Creatures"".  Centers around the heart-capturing and unforgettable child dwarf Simon Birch (born to parents whose ludicrous embarassment at their son's physical condition blinds them to the treasure they've been given), his best friend Joseph (Joseph Mazello), Joseph's winning mother (Ashley Judd) and her enamored suitor (Oliver Platt).  Perfect performances by all, with Ian Michael Smith, who plays Simon, particularly deserving of a special slot in the 'Greatest Performances Of All Time' canon.  Who that ever sees this will ever forget Joseph trying to rally Simon's confidence by telling him that lots of girls like him, and Simon good-naturedly replying that yes, but only in the way girls would like a baby turtle.

To me, it has all the elements of a great story: comedy, tragedy, a good dose of authentic 'americana' (set in coastal Maine), interesting and 'real' characters, a timeless message, powerful archetypes, 'real' emotion and a great soundtrack. What more can you ask for?The film centers around an endearing friendship between two young boys. One, without a father, and the other deformed and virtually disowned by his family, yet born with an uncanny awareness of his destiny and life purpose, which the film eventually plays out. The bond that is developed in this story between the two boys is very affecting. Realistic, without getting at all 'sappy'. All the characters in the film are excellent and fit exceedingly well. The Rev. Russell, Simon, Joe Wentworth, Ben Goodrich and the lovely Ashley Judd as Joe's mother are all superbly portrayed, and each are characters one develops a good deal of empahy for during the course of the film. Even the reverend, a shadow of a man, tormented by the spineless choices of his past is portrayed in his humanity as one deserving of mercy and understanding.The movie is at times hysterically funny too. I mean, really very, very funny! The Christmas Pagaent scene is one of the funniest things I""ve ever seen... maybe because I grew up in that traditional New England atmosphere and have lived through my own version of it!Jim Carey, playing a serious role, makes two brief appearances in the film (at the beginning and the end) as the adult Joe Wentworth, and he fits great in that role. The acting of Joseph Mazzello as the young Joe is among the best acting jobs I've seen by a young person. He steps into the character perfectly.Simon Birch is a wonderful film that acknowledges the spiritual essence of people, divine providence, life purpose, consequence of choices, the connections between souls, the sometimes absurdity of life and the mystery of why life unfolds as it does. Be warned: It easily elicits tears. It is both very heavy and light as a feather. Deep as the ocean and yet it doesn't take itself too seriously. Very well done.

81639,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,0788815466,Wuchak,"[0, 0]","Released in 1998, ""Simon Birch"" was directed and written by Mark Steven Johnson (""Daredevil,"" ""Ghost Rider"") loosely based on John Irving's novel ""A Prayer for Owen Meany.""The story takes place in 1964 in coastal Maine and involves two misfit friends, both 12 years old, both outcasts, Simon a dwarf and Joe a bastard child.Despite his challenging condition Simon strongly believes there's a reason he's a dwarf and that God has a purpose for him. He believes he's going to be a hero of some sort. It's also evident that he believes he's going to die young, perhaps die as a hero. Does he have any proof for this belief? No. It's just something he knows.Joe, on the other hand, desperately wants to know who his father is. His mother (Ashley Judd) got pregnant during her senior year in high school but she's never told anyone the identity of the father. Much of the story involves Simon and Joe trying to figure out who Joe's father is.The reality of Simon's condition is driven home when Joe tells him a local girl finds him cute. Simon responds, ""She means cute like a baby turtle is cute. Girls don't kiss baby turtles."" ""How do you know,"" Joe asks. ""I just know. If you were me you'd know too.""""Simon Birch"" is very reminiscent of 1994's ""Forrest Gump."" Both are named after their protagonist, both take place in the 60s, both involve outcasts who are challenged mentally or physically, both have the same style, both are heavy and light at the same time -- serious drama balanced out by great humor and great tragedy. I have no doubt that director/writer Johnson was shooting for the next ""Forrest Gump.""Although ""Birch"" isn't as good as ""Gump"" it comes close to greatness. Unlike ""Gump"" it failed at the box office, making only $18 million in the USA while costing $20 million, but I've been hearing good things about it for years and finally decided to check it out. I'm glad I did. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed it.For the first 10 minutes or so I wasn't sure if I was going to buy into the film's inevitable contrivances and melodramatics, but the next thing I knew I was sucked into the story and having a good time. When it was all over I had a lot of things to reflect on. In fact, I watched it again. This is a sign of a good film. Yes, there are some ""Yeah, right"" moments but watch a few old b&w; flicks where contrivances and melodramatics are a way of life. A film can get away with being a tad unlikely or sentimental if it is sincere and finds the right tone.One scene involves a baseball hitting someone in the head. This brought to memory something that happened to me when I was around 8 years old: My family and I were walking the trails of Theodore Wirth Park in Minneapolis when we came to the edge of a baseball field. As soon as we entered the outfield somehow I just knew that the current batter was going to hit the ball and it was going to hit me right in the face. I knew it but I didn't know how I knew. I just knew. Next thing you know the batter hits the ball high into the air -- it was like slow motion -- and it came and hit me right on the cheek! (The only good thing was I think it was a softball). How did I KNOW this was going to happen? I don't know, but it's pretty amazing. I bring this up not only because there's a similar scene in ""Simon Birch"" but also because I believe it relates to Simon knowing and believing he had a purpose and was going to die a hero.The idea of Simon dying is no spoiler, by the way. It's revealed right at the opening that Simon and someone else would die before the film ends. This, of course, softens the shock when they do and allows the tale to play as bittersweet nostalgia. Some people call the story sad and tragic, but I don't get this. Again, we know right from the get-go who's going to die. We just don't know when and how. Besides, everyone dies sooner or later (but not every one grows up).This is the first and only film I've ever seen Ashley Judd in and she's ANGELIC. Seriously, Ashley is the definition of spirituality, not to mention stunningly beautiful.Another likable character is Ben Goodrich, played by Oliver Platt. He assumes the father-figure role to both Simon and Joe, but he's very natural about it, not pushy.Some of the themes addressed are:-- Order, purpose and love in a bloody realm of chaos.-- It's possible to be religious but not spiritual.-- If you KNOW something in your heart, never give up or stop believing.-- Who is your real father -- the man from whose loins you came or the one who loves & mentors you?-- The conflict of flesh and spirit, random chance and order, meaningless existence or purposeful life.-- Sex/romance can cause you to make really stoo-pid mistakes.-- Going through religious motions but no longer really believing.-- Religion and truth are not necessarily one in the same. A person can get bogged down in the mire of religion and miss the whole point. Truth, by contrast, always sets FREE (including freedom FROM the carnal nature).The characters are real and likable. There's some crudeness and cussing, but it reflects real life rather than crudeness for the sake of crudeness. Even the 'villains' are not totally unlikable or without sympathy. Rev. Russell comes across more as a man who's simply lost his way while continuing to go through the motions rather than a man out to abuse people. Same thing with the Sunday school teacher.Watch out for the laugh-out-loud scene involving the manger, the baby Jesus and the girl who plays the virgin Mary.Jim Carrey has a small role as Joe when he's an adult, bookending the film and narrating the story. Carrey insisted he not be credited in the advertising of the picture because he didn't want people to be mislead concerning what type of film it is.The locations are gorgeous, filmed in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia, and on the French River in Ontario.The runtime is 1 hour and 50 minutes before the end credits.GRADE: B",4,Order from chaos,1229299200,"12 15, 2008",2008,5908,"['Released', '1998',
