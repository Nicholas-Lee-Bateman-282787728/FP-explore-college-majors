722880,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B00006RZ2W,Andy Orrock,"[1, 3]","&quot;My Wife Is An Actress&quot; is predicated on a cool concept.  It follows the life of an actress named Charlotte, played by Charlotte Gainsbourg, and her husband Yvan, played (and directed) by real-life husband Yvan Attal.In other words, art mirrors life here very, very closely.  You see Charlotte stopped on the street for photos, casually using her celebrity status to get the best seats at restaurants.  Meanwhile, Yvan slowly simmers about various slights (he plays a sports journalist here) due to his reflected glory as &quot;the husband of Charlotte.&quot;Yvan reaches the boiling point when Charlotte crosses the Channel to make a movie with the great English star 'John' (last name never revealed).  Yvan's character - goofy and endearing up until this point - comes off the rails.  He reveals himself to be petty, annoying and just flat-out creepily obsessive.  &quot;My Wife...&quot; ceases to be a comedy at this point.  In fact, it ceases to be pleasing in all regards......but one.  That one, of course, is the great Terence Stamp, who could read a phone book and make it worth your while.  He's brilliant here once again as a slightly self-absorbed - but understandably magnetic - leading man.Also worth noting:  Keith Allen's brilliant take as a prototypical English film director.

European actresses are not necessarily as glamorous as American actresses, and that has something to do with it too.

722882,A29IYGR7SNPRIV,B00006RZ2W,"Charlotte Vale-Allen ""writerinresidence""","[7, 7]","What is as intriguing about this film as the film itself is the background of the stars. Charlotte Gainsbourg is the daughter of the (in)famous Serge Gainsbourg, French singer-songwriter of great international cultural influence and English actress, Jane Birkin. Charlotte is married to her co-star, Yvan Attal, and the screenplay has its roots in their actual life--Yvan's difficulties in being married to someone recognized everywhere she goes.While Charlotte isn't a great beauty in the typically American fashion, she has a compelling screen presence that makes her stardom believable. When in London to do a film with Terence Stamp (all the women in this film gush about what a ""hottie"" he is--and that's simply not believable), husband Yvan's doubts, fears, and jealousy come to full boil.Stamp turns in a gorgeous performance as the archetypal self-involved, always-out-to-impress-the-little-people British actor--wowing the women (while just a bit tipsy) with quotes from plays and poetry. And Charlotte is credibly drawn to him, simply because he is an actor; she needn't justify her existence as a performer.There are some truly funny scenes, especially with Yvan's pregnant sister and her husband who are in a seemingly endless battle over whether or not to circumcise their child. Like Woody Allen's Annie Hall, Yvan's sister has a lot of prickly reactions to the issue of Jewishness (she and Yvan are Jewish, neither of them have Jewish partners.)This is a low-key film with some lovely moments, a fair bit of underlying truth about the illusory aspects of stardom, and fine performances across the board.Highly recommended.",4,Charmingly amusing,1045267200,"02 15, 2003",2003,1637,"['What', 'intriguing', 'film', 'film', 'background', 'stars', 'Charlotte', 'Gainsbourg', 'daughter', 'famous', 'Serge', 'Gainsbourg', 'French', 'singer-songwriter', 'great', 'international', 'cultural', 'influence', 'English', 'actress', 'Jane', 'Birkin', 'Charlotte', 'married', 'co-star', 'Yvan', 'Attal', 'screenplay', 'roots', 'actual', 'life', 'Yvan', 'difficulties', 'being', 'married', 'someone', 'recognized', 'everywhere', 'goes.While', 'Charlotte', ""n't"", 'great', 'beauty', 'typically', 'American', 'fashion', 'compelling', 'screen', 'presence', 'stardom', 'believable', 'When', 'London', 'do', 'film', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'women', 'film', 'gush', 'what', 'hottie', 'simply', 'not', 'believable', 'husband', 'Yvan', 'doubts', 'fears', 'jealousy', 'come', 'full', 'boil.Stamp', 'gorgeous', 'performance', 'archetypal', 'self-involved', 'always-out-to-impress-the-little-people', 'British', 'actor', 'wowing', 'women', 'just', 'bit', 'tipsy', 'quotes', 'plays', 'poetry', 'Charlotte', 'credibly', 'drawn', 'simply', 'actor', 'need', ""n't"", 'justify', 'existence', 'performer.There', 'are', 'truly', 'funny', 'scenes', 'especially', 'Yvan', 'pregnant', 'sister', 'husband', 'who', 'are', 'seemingly', 'endless', 'battle', 'not', 'circumcise', 'child', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'Yvan', 'sister', 'lot', 'prickly', 'reactions', 'issue', 'Jewishness', 'Yvan', 'are', 'Jewish', 'have', 'Jewish', 'partners', 'low-key', 'film', 'lovely', 'moments', 'fair', 'bit', 'underlying', 'truth', 'illusory', 'aspects', 'stardom', 'fine', 'performances', 'board.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A
722883,A3NMZ95PSSUZH8,B00006RZ2W,Christopher Cook,"[0, 0]","Overall, I found this movie to a charming romantic comedy, albeit one that is pretty lacking in overall plot. Charlotte Gainsbourg plays herself, a French movie star, who's husband (real life husband) Yvan Attal is having a hard time adjusting to his wife's noteriety. As he descends into the depths of jealousy, we are given a somewhat funny and interesting look into the mind of a man who at once loves his wife, but at the same time despises the fact that she will always be in the spotlight of both the public and the movie industry. The actors performances were great, especially Attal, who does a great job being both the comical and desparate husband. Also, watch for Ludivine Sagnier (of 8 Femmes and others) in a small role as a woman who causes Yvan to question his committment. Overall, it's a great movie for those looking for a light weight romantic comedy.

It needs a little Allen sermonizing on love and life to put a heart in the center of it's romantic spirit.  What's right with this film? It's an engaging superficial comedic collage viewed as one would a not-very-deep but pleasing French painting of, say, summer people with parasols on a beach, or maybe a bird in a cage looking out the window to a beautiful morning while a lady with grey hair knits nearby. Suffice to say, I love this film.  Director, writer and star Yvan Attal, who casts his real life wife, Charlotte Gainsbourg opposite him, is a comedic marvel, like a juggling, dancing all purpose clown at center stage of the circus refusing to let our eyes wander, as his ordinary life begins to unravel when he suddenly discovers a jealous streak towards his wife's romantic celebrity status.
