1192292,A22GTVN7Q9IZVT,B001FT4PK6,Adam Smithee,"[0, 0]","The structure of the film was not very good....way too much drama, Alex was WAYY over the top...he almost dominated the movie...the film jumped from one melodramatic scene to another. Some of the writing was VERY bad...the scene where Alex rings the bell to discuss the wedding plans was really bad to the point the actors actually looked awkward and embarrassed by the dialogue. Watch it and you'll see it. It's so awkward because the writing is so bad.The movie really cheapened the characters. The TV show was cut VERY prematurely...all the characters had so much development and growth ahead of them and thus, made this move VERY premature...I would say Noah's Arc had at least 5-6 more quality seasons ahead of it before the movie should have been done.Everything was sex, sex, sex, everybody seemed to want sex with everybody. Ricky's character was an afterthought; this movie provided actually nothing for his character whatsoever. I also would've liked Noah's character to have a bit more development to it. Alex's character nearly dominated the entire film.The ending almost makes up for it and it was a bit of a tear-jerker, but it did not excuse the rest of the film. I'd like to see a return of the TV show where this movie can be forgotten as if it never took place.P.S. - ""Baby Gat's"" character was beyond annoying...just...really stomach churning.

I was frankly a little nervous that I wouldn't like the movie, but I shouldn't have been concerned.  ""Jumping"" has all the warmth, humor, and love that the series had, just in a slightly different format and location.Noah and Wade have evidently reconciled (since the series abruptly ended) and they and the boys have assembled (minus a couple characters) on Martha's Vineyard at Wade's family vacation home (an ocean-side mansion, of course) to celebrate their wedding.  Whether they will actually tie the knot (or jump the broom) is anybody's guess, and they don't actually seem too sure about it either.  Noah's friends don't help as they add their own flavors of sexual tension, jealousy, their own couples' problems, and a lot of snide comments.  Add to that a new young guy just coming to grips with what being gay is all about and he acts as a catalyst for a lot of self-disclosure and good discussion amongst the characters.My favorite scene-stealer is Noah's boss, the name-dropping diva who gets all the good lines along with ""Curtis,"" aka ""Baby Gap"" who shows up in hopes of sweeping Noah off his feet.The editing of this movie is tight and spot-on and there is hardly a moment that isn't packed with all the stuff you loved about the series.  The characters have all aged well (i.e. they are smokin' hot) and seem to have had no trouble going back into their ""Noah"" characters.It's funny, it's moving, and it feels real; it's a study in relationships and friendship, courtship and love.

1192311,A25LP5X4SEZ7NT,B001FT4PK6,Mike in Elmhurst,"[2, 2]","As a fan of the late, lamented Logo series, Noah's Arc, I approached this film with a little trepidation. The Logo series was wonderful, but the second season and the quickened plots indicated that Noah's Arc might not be long for this world. It wasn't. Of course, everybody I know watched it and loved it. We asked ourselves: why cancel a smart, sexy, worldly, funny and pertinent show about the ups and downs of a close-knit group of friends that we incorrectly assumed was a hit? Well, the gods of television are ruthless and unkind.Then, they made a film. Would the charm of the series be able to translate onto the big screen? I can assuredly say ""YES!"" and then some!The film picks up where the series left off, ties up a few loose ends and then goes on its merry way as Noah, Alex, Chance, and Ricky travel to Martha's Vineyard, MA, for Noah's wedding to Wade. Chance comes with Eddy. Ricky brings along a young student of Chance's named Brandon. Trey is back in CA taking care his and Alex's newly adopted HIV+ baby, OJ, but Trey shows up via webcam with OJ on Alex's laptop.Thus the stage is set for what the gang hopes will be a celebratory weekend of love and friendship. Of course, everything that could go wrong does, in sometimes the most hilarious ways.Baby Gat shows up unannounced and uninvited along with Brandy, Noah's boss, to throw a wrench in the works. Alex is determined to have the ""perfect"" gay wedding for Noah, popping OTC stimulants to keep the energy going; he then becomes even more rev'd up and imperious than he usually is as he merrily rolls on in his controlling, diva ways. Ricky quickly dumps his young companion, Brandon, and goes on the prowl locally for some anonymous sex, with unexpected results. Chance's and Eddie's relationship starts to show a few cracks and they realize that they may have to come to terms with some unpleasant truths. And Noah and Wade go through the pre-wedding jitters, with enough ups and downs and all-arounds to make a prospective groom's head spin. Toss in a couple of ""coming out to the family"" moments (one unplanned) and the stage is set for a difficult but ultimately revealing weekend for everyone.All the actors shine as brightly, if not more so, than they did in the TV series. The acting is solid and one marvels at this ensemble cast that makes one believe that they really have been friends forever. There are subtle ""teaching moments"" here and there that are not preachy and mix right into the dialogue and action.There are so many comic moments and there are many poignant insights into the complexities of love, friendship, the true meaning of family, self-realization, self-acceptance and long-term commitment.Will Noah and Wade finally Wed? Will Chance and Eddie get back on track? Will Ricky come to terms with his promiscuity? Will Alex be able to give the perfect wedding? Will Baby Gat create his usual chaos and pandemonium?No spoilers here. Just a recommendation that this film will not disappoint and, in fact, will entertain over and over again.Now, if we can just get these guys back on television.....",5,WONDERFUL!!,1249171200,"08 2, 2009",2009,3097,"['fan', 'late', 'lamented', 'Logo', 'series', 'Noah', 'Arc', 'approached', 'film', 'little', 'trepidation', 'Logo', 'series', 'was', 'wonderful', 'second', 'season', 'quickened', 'plots', 'indicated', 'Noah', 'Arc', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'long', 'world', 'was', ""n't"", 'course', 'everybody', 'know', 'watched', 'loved', 'asked', 'ourselves', 'why', 'cancel', 'smart', 'sexy', 'worldly', 'funny', 'pertinent', 'show', 'ups', 'downs', 'close-knit', 'group', 'friends', 'incorrectly', 'assumed', 'was', 'hit', 'Well', 'gods', 'television', 'are', 'ruthless', 'unkind.Then', 'made', 'film', 'Would', 'charm', 'series', 'be', 'able', 'translate', 'big', 'screen', 'can', 'assuredly', 'say', 'YES', 'then', 'film', 'up', 'where', 'series', 'left', 'off', 'up', 'few', 'loose', 'ends', 'then', 'merry', 'way', 'Noah', 'Alex', 'Chance', 'Ricky', 'travel', 'Martha', 'Vineyard', 'MA', 'Noah', 'wedding', 'Wade', 'Chance', 'Eddy', 'Ricky', 'young', 'student', 'Chance', 'named', 'Brandon', 'Trey', 'back', 'CA', 'taking', 'care', 'Alex', 'newly', 'adopted', 'HIV+', 'baby', 'OJ', 'Trey', 'up', 'webcam', 'OJ', 'Alex', 'laptop.Thus', 'stage', 'set', 'what', 'gang', 'hopes', 'will', 'be', 'celebratory', 'weekend', 'love', 'friendship', 'course', 'everything', 'could', 'go', 'wrong', 'sometimes', 'most', 'hilarious', 'ways.Baby', 'Gat', 'up', 'unannounced', 'uninvited', 'Brandy', 'Noah', 'boss', 'throw', 'wrench', 'works', 'Alex', 'determined', 'have', 'perfect', 'gay', 'wedding', 'Noah', 'popping', 'OTC', 'stimulants', 'keep', 'energy', 'going', 'then', 'even', 'more', 'rev', ""'d"", 'up', 'imperious', 'usually', 'merrily', 'controlling', 'diva', 'ways', 'Ricky', 'quickly', 'dumps', 'young', 'companion', 'Brandon', 'prowl', 'locally', 'anonymous', 'sex', 'unexpected', 'results', 'Chance', 'Eddie', 'relationship', 'show', 'few', 'cracks', 'realize', 'may', 'have', 'come', 'terms', 'unpleasant', 'truths', 'Noah', 'Wade', 'go', 'pre-wedding', 'jitters', 'enough', 'ups', 'downs', 'all-arounds', 'make', 'prospective', 'groom', 'head', 'spin', 'Toss', 'couple', 'coming', 'out', 'family', 'moments', 'one', 'unplanned', 'stage', 'set', 'difficult', 'ultimately', 'revealing', 'weekend', 'actors', 'shine', 'brightly', 'not', 'more', 'so', 'did', 'TV', 'series', 'acting', 'solid', 'one', 'marvels', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'one', 'believe', 'really', 'have', 'been', 'friends', 'forever', 'are', 'subtle', 'teaching', 'moments', 'here', 'there', 'are', 'not', 'preachy', 'mix', 'right', 'dialogue', 'action.There', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'comic', 'moments', 'are', 'many', 'poignant', 'insights', 'complexities', 'love', 'friendship', 'true', 'meaning', 'family', 'self-realization', 'self-acceptance', 'long-term', 'commitment.Will', 'Noah', 'Wade', 'finally', 'Wed', 'Will', 'Chance', 'Eddie', 'get', 'back', 'track', 'Will', 'Ricky', 'come', 'terms', 'promiscuity', 'Will', 'Alex', 'be', 'able', 'give', 'perfect', 'wedding', 'Will', 'Baby', 'Gat', 'create', 'usual', 'chaos', 'pandemonium', 'No', 'spoilers', 'here', 'Just', 'recommendation', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'disappoint', 'fact', 'will', 'entertain', 'again.Now', 'can', 'just', 'get', 'guys', 'back', 'television', '..']",Noah's Arc: Jumping the Broom

Surprisingly, even in the ""gay mecca"" of San Francisco, it had a very short run at a less than top notch theater, but I managed to see it before it closed.  My review is therefore about the film itself and not the dvd.I really liked Noah's Arc on Logo.  Funnier than Showtime's Queer As Folk and every bit as sexy, it was a delight to watch.  I thought that the film fell short of the TV series, though.  Not that I could write and direct a feature film, but I think that writing and directing half-hour or hour length shows for TV is quite different than writing and directing a feature film.

Halford ""Comedy Fan""","[0, 0]","I really liked the series and was disappointed when it was cancelled after only two seasons (shame on you, Logo network!). It deftly alternated riotous humor with deeply moving moments, all revolving around the sweet entity that is Noah and his ""universe"" of friends: Flamboyant Alex, scholarly Chance & promiscuous Ricky. It was such a pleasant surprise to see a film that not only tied the knot between Noah & his hunky beau Wade, but tied up loose ends left from the series. Off to a gorgeous home at Martha's Vineyard, Noah & Wade are already suffering from pre-wedding jitters when high drama is dropped off at their doorstep: A pill-popping Alex obsesses over wedding details, Chance & his husband Eddie come precariously close to divorce, and Ricky--with cute nineteen year-old Brandon in tow--drops what is undoubtedly the biggest bombshell of all (sorry, no spoiler alert!). Add to this the unexpected arrival of Noah's sassy boss & closeted, troublemaking rapper Baby Gat to the mix, and it all makes for a recipe for disaster! I was happy that the film stayed consistent with the series as far as quality: It's well-written, with hilarious, sexy moments & scenes of profound soul searching, and the cast slips easily back into their roles as if they've never left!Like many fans, I'd be interested in seeing another film which brings the characters up to date.

While I am not a regular viewer of the TV show, I've seen enough episodes at their house to be familiar with the core characters and a little of their history together.While Jumping the Broom would never be called great cinema, it was an immensely enjoyable experience for my friends and I.  We laughed our butts off at Alex's wired exploits in the kitchen, enjoyed the gorgeous eye candy of Noah, Ricky and Wade, and tsk-tsked at Ricky's even-tackier-than-usual behavior (leaving the date he brought to the wedding to have sex with strangers).  While we got some laughs out of Brandy's 'morning after' look and behavior, I felt that the whole Baby Gat & Brandy storyline was unnecessary and did not add much to the movie.The constant bickering and multiple ""marriage trouble"" storylines got to be a bit much, not because each wasn't believeable or engaging, but because--for me at least--it was overkill.  Do we have to see EVERYONE having relationship problems at the same time?

1192320,A3F2LSOZYJUTKO,B001FT4PK6,"Zee Jai ""Liberator migr ire""","[12, 13]","Earlier this year, a big screen adaptation of Sex & The City was released. Actually, that's not true, a ninety minute advert for Products was released, with the characters from Sex & The City grafted on to make people watch.Noah's Arc is often referred to - for better or worse - as a black, gay SATC. So, when I heard the news that the prematurely cancelled series would also be bursting onto cinema screens, I had my doubts. Television and film are very different beasts, and one doesn't necessarily translate into another. Just look at SATC - a depressing, cynical exercise in vulgar consumerism.When Noah's Arc first appeared on our screens, it was unique: a show that wasn't about white gay men. It was Queer As Folk in colour, and funnier. The series suffered under the tyranny of network television censorship (that NA was as hot as it was is a miracle) and a miniscule running time. But it was bursting with heart and soul, and audiences fell in love with Noah, Ricky, Alex and Chance - not to mention their numerous sexy suitors.Season two ended on a cliff-hanger, but with criminal disregard for the loyalty of the viewing audience, Logo cancelled the series, just when it was finding its feet.Let's not be bitter, because we have something to celebrate. Noah and Wade are getting married! We might not have a Season 3 (yet), but we've got Jumping The Broom. So what happened after the car crash? Did Noah wake up and find Wade in the shower? Did the whole of season two not happen? Was it all a dream?Don't be silly, kids. The movie is set at some point after the crash, which Wade survived. That's not a spoiler - he's all over the publicity photos, and Noah's Arc without Wade would be like SATC without Big. But what of Dre, I hear you cry! Well now, you'll just have to watch and see.And what of Jumping The Broom?It's a joy. A big, sexy, laugh out loud joy. There's smiles and frowns, and tears, and... er, Baby Gat (Jason Steed). Oh, Baby Gat. He's back, innit, full of bruvs and bluds, u get me. This one needs his own series. He lights up the screen and steals the show. I beg u, giv the boi his own show, innit. Brandy's (Jennia Fredrique) back too, bringing a lil fem to the table. Gary LeRoi Gray's Brandon is a refreshing addition to the clique. They're all welcome guests.Only Gregory Kieth's Trey is missing in action, which is a real shame. His long-suffering relationship with Alex was always a pleasure to view. Don't worry, all is not lost - he puts in a welcome cameo via webcam, in a pleasing throwback to Season one. It's a shame we couldn't exchange Trey for Jonathan Julian's depressing Eddie. I'm not quite sure if it's the character, or if the actor isn't quite at home here, but Eddie just gets me down. At least in the series his appearances were kept to a minimum - but we're forced into close quarters with him here. But that's a small quibble. The truth of the matter is this movie is packed with so many ""OMG - I can't believe he/they just did that!"" moments that such minor shortcomings can be overlooked.Noah's Arc: Jumping The Broom is heartfelt, hilarious and packed with eye candy.
