I only ever saw it as lousy quality tapes that someone else had made from Comedy Central airings, so I was thrilled to see it released on DVD.This is one of those shows that thrives on pushing the boundaries of bad taste all in the context of the afterschool special formula.In addition to Sedaris' expert job at playing a hapless re-entry high school student, the job of Colbert and Delillo as two of her teachers is amazing.  Delillo especially is amazingly good at SOUNDING like a very concerned sensitive teacher while telling his students horrible demeaning comments.  The short snippets of Colbert's 'history' lessons are an amazing satire of how history is taught and are very much in the vein of his work on the Daily Show.This is easily the funniest show I have seen in a long time.

753595,A23L2BR07AOBG1,B00009B8FW,alex bushman,"[2, 2]","Yes, After School Specials.  This is probably one of the shows that is better on VHS because the worn tapes because so much funnier given their low production look and feel.  Given that, it's one of the funniest shows ever because, like all sketch comedy, it goes too far, but it's satiric aim is dead on.  The only reason this series didn't take off is that it's dramatic effect is so arcane that many who see it for the first time will  be shocked, or disgusted by what they see and not watch it again. Well, even those who like the show are sometimes shocked and disgusted, but the show more than makes up for it by being absolutely hysterical and featuring performers who can improvise on a dime and have wits like razors.  The same can be said of the writers.  When you combine these two elements you get a timeless show and this is the beginning.

Yup, and she has a younger (17 year-old) relative going there too (He's shamed but aint' no shame in her game) The former stripper decided to get an education and fix her wrongs before she gets old (which isn't too long for her). The show is sooo funny, no wonder it became a huge cult hit in 1999 when it premiered. I still remember all the commercials advertising it and all the gossip about it...it was great, but after 2 successful seasons and one floppier season, the show was tragically cancelled in 2001, only 3 seasons completed...but it's okay, those 34 or so episodes will all be released by comedy central. Now the DVD is cool and counting the pilot I think it has 11 episodes total. I remember watching the show when I was 11 in 99' every week with my oldest brother, we would sometimes yell and roll with laughter, other times I would be asking myself huh? Because I was only 11, the sex jokes didn't make sense much...but now they do, unfortunately...(LOL) Anyway, buy this DVD, you can't go wrong and each of season 1's episodes are funny, can't wait for season 2 (2000) and season 3 (2001).For some reason in mid 2000 I kind of was busy with school and stopped watching it alot, I saw it once every few weeks, but I still remember it well, I never saw the complete season 2 and I only saw like 1 episode in season 3, and I saw 9 out of the 11 from season 1 (I saw the pilot which is included).

753599,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00009B8FW,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[46, 46]","I had almost forgotten how much I loved this show until Comedy Central released this Season One DVD.  Strangers With Candy was an absolutely brilliant comedy that took the concept of After-School Specials and turned it on its head - then gave it a wedgie - and then gave it a swirlie.  A decidedly weird parody of this respected but stereotypical genre, one which never feared to go farther than most people could even conceive of in its inanity and bold disregard of political correctness necessarily plays to one of two extremes: either you hate the show and refuse to watch anything so ridiculous again in your life or you, like me, develop an obsessive fascination and love for it.  I'm frankly rather surprised to see this Season One DVD released, but my reaction to the news, alongside a mad rush to get it in my hands as soon as possible, was, to quote a favorite line from lead character Jerri Blank, ""Good times.  Good times.""Jerri Blank (Amy Sedaris) is rather amazingly representative, in her own special way, of your typical high school student.  What makes this so amazing is the fact that she is a forty-six-year-old freshman.  After thirty-two years of drug abuse, prison time, and who knows what else, she has returned home to pick up where she left off when she ran away from home.  Flat Point High School is not your typical educational oasis, as becomes obvious immediately.  Mr. Noblet (Stephen Colbert) and Mr. Jellineck (Paul Dinello) are two unique teachers who play a big role in Jerri's life, dispensing such tidbits of advice as ""No one makes friends with a failure"" and ""You're only as attractive as we think you are,"" while enjoying an openly ""secret"" relationship of their own.  The towering force at the school, however, is Principal Blackman (Greg Hollimon), whose educational theories are, in a word, unusual and whose narcissism knows no bounds.  If you thought your old teachers were weird, you ought to take a look at these guys.Jerri deals with many issues routinely covered in after-school specials: trying to be popular, dating, racism, dealing with peer pressure (as well as pressure from the principal and teachers), accepting a new student, coping with an extremely dysfunctional family (the most normal member of which, her father, appears only in immovable poses), and, of course drugs.  In the very first episode, she turns to what she knows - brewing up drugs - in her effort to become popular, only to watch a stoned girl try to fly through a keyhole.  Jerri can be a sympathetic character dealing with her step-mother's alcoholism one minute, and then the next she is assuming the role of an abusive husband to her baby care partner.  This really is one of those shows you can't describe; you have to see it to understand it.There aren't a lot of extras on the DVDs, but what is there is fantastic.  The unaired pilot of the show was strange indeed, as it featured a much different look for Jerri, a step-mother played by the woman who would end up being Jerri's gym teacher, an after-school volunteer job for Jerri at a home for senior citizens, terrible music, and a completely different feel to the whole viewing experience.  The commentary provided by the creators and stars of the show, Amy Sedaris, Stephen Colbert, and Paul Dinello, is great fun.  While only four of the ten episodes from Season One include a commentary, the information, reference to gags and side jokes that I had missed up until now, stories about the sometimes seat-of-your-pants manner in which everything came together for each episode, and general humor they expressed at the sight of old scenes takes a Strangers With Candy fanatic such as myself to even deeper and more appreciative heights of humor and fun.What is perhaps most strange about Strangers With Candy is its success at making good and relevant points about some of the serious matters it subjects to a humiliating treatment in the name of comedy.  I'm not entirely sure it does this intentionally, though, because the main point of concentration oftentimes seems to revolve around seeing just what they could actually get away with doing on television.  If you are content with the same old predictable humor that the networks recycle year in and year out, you probably should avoid diving into the deep end of the humor pool, but if you yearn for something else, something different, something so stupid that its brilliance shines forth like a shooting star zooming across a horizon populated by distant glimmers of comedic light, then you may just find something strange and beautiful and hilarious in this unforgettable show.",5,The bacon strip is sizzling,1057363200,"07 5, 2003",2003,4621,"['had', 'almost', 'forgotten', 'how', 'much',

753600,A27FR2C67JPDRS,B00009B8FW,Daryl B,"[21, 21]","Comedy Central's cult classic has finally made its way to dvd, something I pictured never happening.  After being cancelled, with only three seasons to its credit, I was afraid that ""Strangers With Candy"" might fade into obscurity.  Luckily, there were lots of fans out there who, like me, found it's dark, insane humor riotously funny.  This dvd offering gives us the first 10 episodes, introducing us to Jerri Blank, a 46 yr old ex con, ex prostitute, ex drug user---ex you-name-it! as she struggles while returning to high school where she left off after running away 32 years ago. As a freshman, Jerri must deal with trying to fit in, wanting to make friends, be popular---all the things a typical freshman wants in school.  Told in the format of the old afterschool specials that warned us of drugs, unwanted pregnancy, etc., this series worked brilliantly.  Thanks mostly, of course, to Amy Sedaris who plays Jerri Blank to perfection.  Add in Stephen Colbert and Paul Dinello as teachers (and closeted lovers) and an array of other characters and the show always hits the mark.  I love the relationship between Jerri and her step mother played by Deborah Rush, who plays this role to a tee.  The dvd offers a few extras such as running commentary during episodes and a bonus unaired pilot.  It was interesting watching this pilot, seeing how that changed Jerri and some of the situations she was in for the actual series.  If you are a fan of this show, this dvd is a MUST!!!  I've read that if this dvd sells well, the other two seasons will be released as well.  I hope that is true because there were so many classic moments in seasons 2 and 3.

""Strangers With Candy"" is based upon the unlikely premise of 46 year-old ex junkie whore Jerri Blank turning around her life by returning as a high school freshman after 32 years on the wild side. Each week brings some new ""crisis,"" which involves fitting in vs. conforming, trying drugs and alcohol, teenage sexual experimentation, retardation and special ed, etc. Naturally, half-wit Jerri always makes the wrong choice.""Strangers With Candy"" was Comedy Central's most clever and politically incorrect show (even moreso than ""South Park""). Along with Jerri are her alcoholic stepmother (prudishly played by Deborah Rush), a classmate of indeterminate ethnicity (""Orlando,"" played by Orlando Pabotoy) who Jerri uses for the butt of her racist jokes, and the amazingly narcissistic faculty, headed by Principal Onyx Blackman (Greg Hollimon), the black principal with a penchant for ""fine white women."" Blackman has a thing for Jerri's stepmom, but it never pans out, because her stepmom is as big a racist as Jerri! Swishy art teacher Joffrey Jellineck (Paul Dinello) and uptight science teacher Chuck Knoblet (Stephen Colbert) confound students with their learned ignorance, and the pair carry on a secret gay affair in the boiler room.But Sedaris really makes the show work for her over-the-top earnestness in playing Jerri. Sedaris wins the Chloris Leachman award for botching up her natural good looks with gaudy makeup, harelip overbite, twitching unibrow, wrinkled forehead and padded hips just to get totally into character. And like Lucille Ball, Sedaris will do anything for a laugh, but unlike Ball, we're talking NC-17 rated here!It was a shame to watch it being given the boot in 2001 because of low ratings. For some reason, it never caught on. However, it is becoming evident that it was because ""Strangers With Candy"" was ahead of its time: All three seasons are now available on DVD, and a ""prequel"" movie (with ALL the original major cast members, including the cute-as-a-button Maria Thayer) is currently in post-production.The best two episodes in this set are the pilot ""Who Wants Cake,"" in which Blackman and Knoblet make Jerri rat out her locker mate for being retarded (by the way, ""they all want cake"") and ""Feather in the Storm,"" in which Jerri becomes anorexic, in order to lose enough weight to make the debate squad (?!)Put this excellent series on your DVD player and be prepared to be entertained, humored and offended.",5,They All Want Cake,1102550400,"12 9, 2004",2004,2652,"['Amy', 'Sedaris', 'Paul', 'Dinello', 'Stephen', 'Colbert', 'Gregory', 'Hollimon', 'shine', 'Strangers', 'Candy', 'sublime', 'spoof', 'ABC', 'School', 'Specials', 'grew', 'up', 'late', '1970s', 'early', '80s', 'Strangers', 'Candy', 'based', 'unlikely', 'premise', '46', 'year-old', 'ex', 'junkie', 'Jerri', 'Blank', 'turning', 'around', 'life', 'returning', 'high', 'school', 'freshman', '32', 'years', 'wild', 'side', 'week', 'new', 'crisis', 'fitting', 'vs.', 'conforming', 'trying', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'teenage', 'sexual', 'experimentation', 'retardation', 'special', 'ed', 'etc', 'Naturally', 'half-wit', 'Jerri', 'always', 'wrong', 'choice', 'Strangers', 'Candy', 'was', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'most', 'clever', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'show', 'even', 'moreso', 'South', 'Park', 'Jerri', 'are', 'alcoholic', 'stepmother', 'prudishly', 'played', 'Deborah', 'Rush', 'classmate', 'indeterminate', 'ethnicity', 'Orlando', 'played', 'Orlando', 'Pabotoy', 'who', 'Jerri', 'uses', 'butt', 'racist', 'jokes', 'amazingly', 'narcissistic', 'faculty', 'headed', 'Principal', 'Onyx', 'Blackman', 'Greg', 'Hollimon', 'black', 'principal', 'penchant', 'fine', 'white', 'women', 'Blackman', 'thing', 'Jerri', 'stepmom', 'never', 'out', 'stepmom', 'as', 'big', 'racist', 'Jerri', 'Swishy', 'teacher', 'Joffrey', 'Jellineck', 'Paul', 'Dinello', 'uptight', 'science', 'teacher', 'Chuck', 'Knoblet', 'Stephen', 'Colbert', 'confound', 'students', 'learned', 'ignorance', 'pair', 'carry', 'secret', 'gay', 'affair', 'boiler', 'room.But', 'Sedaris', 'really', 'show', 'work', 'over-the-top', 'earnestness', 'playing', 'Jerri', 'Sedaris', 'Chloris', 'Leachman', 'award', 'botching', 'up', 'natural', 'good', 'looks', 'gaudy', 'makeup', 'harelip', 'overbite', 'twitching', 'unibrow', 'wrinkled', 'forehead', 'padded', 'hips', 'just', 'get', 'totally', 'character', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'Sedaris', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'laugh', 'Ball', ""'re"", 'talking', 'NC-17', 'rated', 'here', 'was', 'shame', 'watch', 'being', 'given', 'boot', '2001', 'low', 'ratings', 'reason', 'never', 'caught', 'However', 'becoming', 'evident', 'was', 'Strangers', 'Candy', 'was', 'ahead', 'time', 'three', 'seasons', 'are', 'now', 'available', 'DVD', 'prequel', 'movie', 'original', 'major', 'cast', 'members', 'including', 'cute-as-a-button', 'Maria', 'Thayer', 'currently', 'post-production.The', 'best', 'two', 'episodes', 'set', 'are', 'pilot', 'Who', 'Cake', 'Blackman', 'Knoblet', 'make', 'Jerri', 'rat', 'locker', 'mate', 'being', 'retarded', 'way', 'want', 'cake', 'Feather', 'Storm', 'Jerri', 'anorexic', 'order', 'lose', 'enough', 'weight', 'make', 'debate', 'squad', 'Put', 'excellent', 'series', 'DVD', 'player', 'be', 'prepared', 'be', 'entertained', 'humored', 'offended']",Strangers With Candy - Season One

753611,A37F6PQRBCAKL6,B00009B8FW,J. W. James,"[1, 1]","Where do I begin with this show?  First off, SWC is perhaps one of the most bitingly funny TV shows that Comedy Central ever aired.  It's right up there with other great shows such as Mr. Show, MTV's The State and Mystery Science Theater 3000.  Although the series didn't last any longer than three seasons, it has become a big cult hit regardless.One of the reasons I enjoy this show so much is for its well-written, extremely clever characters.  Whether it be the secretly gay lovers Noblet and Jellineck, or the ""dictator"" principal Onyx Blackman, to Jerri's stereotypical jerk brother Derrick and her delightfully wicked stepmother Sara, to the lead character Jerri Blank herself, there is a ton of depth that make all these characters shine.The episodes themselves are skewered parodies of ""Afterschool Specials"" except that Jerri always does the wrong thing in the end, yet it all works out.  This DVD collects every episode from the first season.  One thing to be said about SWC is that season by season, it is consistently good and funny.  There are quite a few good episodes from Season one including ""Feather in the Storm"", ""To Be Young, Gifted, and Blank"", and ""A Burden's Burden"", among others.  Also included is the original pilot for the series that (thankfully) never aired.  Although future episodes borrowed heavily from this pilot, the episode itself is pretty rough and obviously a big overhaul was needed.Also included on the DVD is commentary for three episodes.  I must admit it is quite disappointing that there isn't any commentary for the rest of the season but hopefully that will be corrected if any of the future seasons are put out on DVD.I must say I truly enjoy this show and think this DVD is well worth the purchase.",5,"A brilliant, odd series",1060214400,"08 7, 2003",2003,1749,"['Where', 'do', 'begin', 'show', 'First', 'SWC', 'perhaps', 'one', 'most', 'bitingly', 'funny', 'TV', 'shows', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'ever', 'aired', 'right', 'there', 'other', 'great', 'shows', 'such', 'Mr.', 'Show', 'MTV', 'State', 'Mystery', 'Science', 'Theater', '3000', 'series', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'longer', 'three', 'seasons', 'become', 'big', 'cult', 'hit', 'regardless.One', 'reasons', 'enjoy', 'show', 'so', 'much', 'well-written', 'extremely', 'clever', 'characters', 'be', 'secretly', 'gay', 'lovers', 'Noblet', 'Jellineck', 'dictator', 'principal', 'Onyx', 'Blackman', 'Jerri', 'stereotypical', 'jerk', 'brother', 'Derrick', 'delightfully', 'wicked', 'stepmother', 'Sara', 'lead', 'character', 'Jerri', 'Blank', 'ton', 'depth', 'make', 'characters', 'shine.The', 'episodes', 'are', 'skewered', 'parodies', 'Afterschool', 'Specials', 'Jerri', 'always', 'wrong', 'thing', 'end', 'out', 'DVD', 'episode', 'first', 'season', 'One', 'thing', 'be', 'said', 'SWC', 'season', 'season', 'consistently', 'good', 'funny', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'good', 'episodes', 'Season', 'one', 'including', 'Feather', 'Storm', 'Be', 'Young', 'Gifted', 'Blank', 'A', 'Burden', 'Burden', 'others', 'Also', 'included', 'original', 'pilot', 'series', 'thankfully', 'never', 'aired', 'future', 'episodes', 'borrowed', 'heavily', 'pilot', 'episode', 'pretty', 'rough', 'obviously', 'big', 'overhaul', 'was', 'needed.Also', 'included', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'three', 'episodes', 'must', 'admit', 'quite', 'disappointing', ""n't"", 'commentary', 'rest', 'season', 'hopefully', 'will', 'be', 'corrected', 'future', 'seasons', 'are', 'put', 'out', 'DVD.I', 'must', 'say', 'truly', 'enjoy', 'show', 'think', 'DVD', 'well', 'purchase']",Strangers With Candy - Season One

After all the cheesily formulated, badly scripted, family oriented after-school dramas and sitcoms which has been pumped out year after year - trying to re-educate the impressionable youth (particularly rich white suburban kids) about finding a true sense of direction and morality, etc, whilst also trying to be 'entertaining' for braindead Christian families - this show was just begging to be made.  If the style of humour in shows such as South Park and Family Guy appeals to you, chances are you'll probably enjoy this one.  If you don't end up loving it you'll at least appreciate the satire, characterization and randomness all in impeccable timing.

It starred this old looking lady who was 46 years old and starting her life right where she left off, high school. She was a user, a boozer, and a loser. She was my new hero. Stephen Colbert, before his Daily Show claim to fame, showed that he is a comedic genius. Jerri Blank and company have created some of the best comedic farse and satire that I have seen in a very long time. This DVD is quite a little miracle, never did I think I would be able to rewatch this show again. It's like meeting and old friend after a long time apart. Never has a main character been more repugnant and loveable at the same time. Come join us won't you. Don't be afraid, take candy from strangers.

753627,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,B00009B8FW,Westley,"[119, 123]","I really loved ""Strangers with Candy"" and was sad when it was cancelled prematurely.  The series ran for 30 some episodes, and the first 10 episodes (season 1) are included on this 2 DVD set.  ""Strangers"" stars Amy Sedaris (sister of auther David Sedaris), Steven Colbert (seen on the ""Daily Show""), and Paul Dinello.  These three worked together for years (e.g., ""Exit 57"") before creating this series.Amy Sedaris plays Jerri Blank, a 46-year-old loser who returns to high school after being a teenaged runaway for 32 years.  Her father is immobile, and her step-mother and half-brother hate her.  The series is patterned after an after-school episode, and each one ends in Jerri learning a ""lesson"" (as well as participating in funky dance sequences!).  The humor is sometimes bizzare, often raunchy, and always politically incorrect!Episode 1: Old Habits, New Beginnings.  Jerri tries to fit in by mixing up some drugs (glint) for a popular cheerleader (Poppy), with tragic results.  Jerri loses the first in a long series of pets and does her first ""I got something to say!"" bit.Episode 2: A Burden's Burden.  Jerri is given a 10-pound baby (whom she dubs ""Dizzy"") by her health teacher.  She fails miserably and is paired up with Tammi Littlenut to complete the assignment.  Teacher Noblet and Jellineck begin their unusual ""relationship.""  This episode is hilarious and presents a new, more demented side of Jerri.Episode 3: Dreams on the Rocks.  Jerri get a leading role in the school production of ""A Raisin in the Sun,"" beating out several African-American students!  This acting success leads Jerri's step-mother on a ""hilarious"" alcolohic bender.Episode 4: Who wants cake?  Jerri is asked to determine whether her lockermate, Kimberly, is ""[mentally challenged].""  If she doesn't cooperate, she'll miss the school trip to Good Time Island.Episode 5: Bogie Nights.  Jerri falls for the new kid in school (Ricky, played by Chip from ""Kate & Ally""), much to the consternation of her fellow students.Episode 6: Jerri Is Only Skin Deep.  Jerri runs for Homecoming Queen.  She tries to increase her ""inner beauty"" by doing volunteer work, with tragic results for a chicken.Episode 7: Let Freedom Ring.  Jerri is suspected of writing a racial slur on a school wall, and she tries to seduce a student who supposedly witnessed the event.  Jerri famously asserts that she likes the ""pole and the hole.""Episode 8: Feather in the Storm: Jerri wants to try out for the debate team, but everyone tells her that she's too fat, leading her to develop an eating disorder.Episode 9: To Be Young, Gifted and Blank.  Mr. Noblet tries to turn Jerri into a violin prodigy, driving a wedge between himself and Mr. Jellineck.Episode 10: The Trip Back.  Jerri becomes attracted to a young female stoner and begins doing pot.Extras: Sedaris, Colbert, and Dinello do audio commentary for four episodes.  They are hilarious together, and the commentaries help shed some light on their bizarre senses of humor.The original, unaired pilot is also included.  The plot is similar to the ""Who Wants Cake?"" episode, but there are quite a few differences.  Notably, Jerri has a volunteer job at a genertonology rehab center and Dinello and Colbert have dual roles.  The pilot is not as good as the later episodes, but it's interesting to see how the series evolved.",5,"Extremely Funny, Raunchy Show",1058486400,"07 18, 2003",2003,3341,"['really', 'loved', 'Strangers', 'Candy', 'was', 'sad', 'when', 'was', 'cancelled', 'prematurely', 'series', 'ran', '30', 'episodes', 'first', '10', 'episodes', 'season', '1', 'are', 'included', '2', 'DVD', 'set', 'Strangers', 'stars', 'Amy', 'Sedaris', 'sister', 'auther', 'David', 'Sedaris', 'Steven', 'Colbert', 'seen', 'Daily', 'Show', 'Paul', 'Dinello', 'three', 'worked', 'together', 'years', 'e.g.', 'Exit', '57', 'creating', 'series.Amy', 'Sedaris', 'Jerri', 'Blank', '46-year-old', 'loser', 'who', 'high', 'school', 'being', 'teenaged', 'runaway', '32', 'years', 'father', 'immobile', 'step-mother', 'half-brother', 'hate', 'series', 'patterned', 'after-school', 'episode', 'one', 'Jerri', 'learning', 'lesson', 'as', 'well', 'participating', 'funky', 'dance', 'sequences', 'humor', 'sometimes', 'bizzare', 'often', 'raunchy', 'always', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'Episode', '1', 'Old', 'Habits', 'New', 'Beginnings', 'Jerri', 'fit', 'mixing', 'up', 'drugs', 'glint', 'popular', 'cheerleader', 'Poppy', 'tragic', 'results', 'Jerri', 'first', 'long', 'series', 'pets', 'first', 'got', 'something', 'say', 'bit.Episode', '2', 'Burden', 'Burden', 'Jerri', 'given', '10-pound', 'baby', 'whom', 'Dizzy', 'health', 'teacher', 'miserably', 'paired', 'up', 'Tammi', 'Littlenut', 'complete', 'assignment', 'Noblet', 'Jellineck', 'begin', 'unusual', 'relationship', 'episode', 'hilarious', 'new', 'more', 'demented', 'side', 'Jerri.Episode', '3', 'Dreams', 'Rocks', 'Jerri', 'get', 'leading', 'role', 'school', 'production', 'A', 'Raisin', 'Sun', 'beating', 'out', 'several', 'African-American', 'students', 'acting', 'success', 'Jerri', 'step-mother', 'hilarious', 'alcolohic', 'bender.Episode', '4', 'Who', 'cake', 'Jerri', 'asked', 'determine', 'lockermate', 'Kimberly', '[', 'mentally', 'challenged', ']', ""n't"", 'cooperate', ""'ll"", 'miss', 'school', 'trip', 'Good', 'Time', 'Island.Episode', '5', 'Bogie', 'Nights', 'Jerri', 'new', 'kid', 'school', 'Ricky', 'played', 'Chip', 'Kate', 'Ally', 'much', 'consternation', 'fellow', 'students.Episode', '6', 'Jerri', 'Only', 'Skin', 'Deep', 'Jerri', 'Homecoming', 'Queen', 'increase', 'inner', 'beauty', 'doing', 'volunteer', 'work', 'tragic', 'results', 'chicken.Episode', '7', 'Let', 'Freedom', 'Ring', 'Jerri', 'suspected', 'writing', 'racial', 'slur', 'school', 'wall', 'seduce', 'student', 'who', 'supposedly', 'witnessed', 'event', 'Jerri', 'famously', 'pole', 'hole', 'Episode', '8', 'Feather', 'Storm', 'Jerri', 'try', 'out', 'debate', 'team', 'everyone', 'too', 'fat', 'leading', 'develop', 'eating', 'disorder.Episode', '9', 'Be', 'Young', 'Gifted', 'Blank', 'Mr.', 'Noblet', 'turn', 'Jerri', 'violin', 'prodigy', 'driving', 'wedge', 'Mr.', 'Jellineck.Episode', '10', 'Trip', 'Back', 'Jerri', 'becomes', 'attracted', 'young', 'female', 'stoner', 'doing', 'pot.Extras', 'Sedaris', 'Colbert', 'Dinello', 'do', 'audio', 'commentary', 'four', 'episodes', 'are', 'hilarious', 'together', 'commentaries', 'help', 'shed', 'light', 'bizarre', 'senses', 'humor.The', 'original', 'unaired', 'pilot', 'also', 'included', 'plot', 'similar', 'Who', 'Cake', 'episode', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'differences', 'Notably', 'Jerri', 'volunteer', 'job', 'genertonology', 'rehab', 'center', 'Dinello', 'Colbert', 'have', 'dual', 'roles', 'pilot', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'later', 'episodes', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'series', 'evolved']",Strangers With Candy - Season One
