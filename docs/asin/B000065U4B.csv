The characters and performances (with the exception of Jordon Brower) just arent fleshed out realistically ...and others are just downright annoying.One review states that this movie should be watched with the directors commentary on.

700340,A15Q9YEG1XPEJN,B000065U4B,Get What We Give,"[5, 6]","Speedway Junky is an indie film and as such I think we need to provide some latitude with regard to a rating scale. That said, the script of an independent film does not need to be given any latitude. Such is the case with this film. The young actors who carry this film are doing their level best to make this an engaging film - and to their credit, that much happens. In fact, the acting here is far better than many much higher profile films.Jesse Bradford (of Hackers and Clockstoppers) is a teenager who's run away from home to become a race car driver in Charlotte, NC (thus the title of the film). He makes it to Las Vegas where (fairly believably) he expects to strike it rich and finance the rest of his trip to NC. Of course, he is ripped off and forced to stay in Vegas and basically live on the street. Then he meets Eric (Jordan Brower), whom he doesn't realize is an underage male prostitute. He and Eric become friends and he begins living in Eric's (is it an abandoned building or is it just a really seedy weekly hotel?) place.Apparently here is where the story begins to get hackneyed and disjointed. Of course, you can ultimately follow the story, but it just doesn't have the flow necessary to keep the tensions high when they need to be, nor the emotions steady when they need to be.Eric, of course, is a cute as a bug, clean cut, non-drug using, prostitute with a heart of gold (aren't they all?). He falls for Bradford, but Bradford isn't gay (he later divulges that he is in fact a virgin - period. Eric hangs out with a group of other teen boys and girls (are they all prostitutes and thieves or just some of them?). To the credit of the screenwriter, the ""leading"" kids are unique and identifiable.Jonathon Taylor Thomas (of Home Improvement fame) shows up as a slick smoothe ""buy""sexual (""if you buy him something nice, he'll have sex with you"") streetwalker. Just what this capable actor is doing in this film is unknown. He is good in the part, what there is of it, but either he or the screenwriter, or the editor decided to make his character vague and lackluster. Thomas is the villain of the piece and as such we should know more about him, but we don't.Darryl Hanna shows up as a former female prostitute with a heart of gold, dating a cop, and who just happens to be the best friend of Eric's mother who abandoned him (got all that?). I've always thought that Hanna was an ""actor-lite,"" and I've never been sure how she managed to get as many parts as she has. Here, in a fairly creepy scene (Hanna's pushing 40 isn't she?) she ""deflowers"" our little star, Bradford, as a favor for her little buddy Eric, who goes nuts over the thought that Bradford is having sex with someone other than him. To his credit, Brower, makes his young character believable and charismatic.I won't go farther in detailing the plot, because it does have a touching and interesting ""twist"" in it, but it is one that you've seen before in dozens of films of similar genre (Sharkey's Machine, My Own Private Idaho, and any other film where there is a good-hearted hooker in love with a respectable person).It's not that this is a BAD film, because it's not. In fact, I think with a better edit job, the film could be much better. With a beefier script and editor, it could be supremely better.Make no mistakes: this is a drama and a slow one. However, the performances make it worth watching, even if the script is lacking.I do recommend this film, because it is far better than many other ""gay"" genre or prostitute genre films such as ""No One Sleeps"" (or any other film Wolf Video). In fact, Gus Van Sant, as executive producer, seems to have had a hand in aspects of the film.Check it out, but don't expect it to be a fully satisfying venture.",2,"Interesting & disappointing appetizer, but not a whole meal",1024876800,"06 24, 2002",2002,3755,"['Speedway', 'Junky', 'indie', 'film', 'such', 'think', 'need', 'provide', 'latitude', 'regard', 'rating', 'scale', 'said', 'script', 'independent', 'film', 'not', 'need', 'be', 'given', 'latitude', 'Such', 'case', 'film', 'young', 'actors', 'who', 'carry', 'film', 'are', 'doing', 'level', 'best', 'make', 'engaging', 'film', 'credit', 'much', 'happens', 'fact', 'acting', 'here', 'far', 'better', 'many', 'much', 'higher', 'profile', 'films.Jesse', 'Bradford', 'Hackers', 'Clockstoppers', 'teenager', 'who', 'run', 'away', 'home', 'become', 'race', 'car', 'driver', 'Charlotte', 'NC', 'thus', 'title', 'film', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'where', 'fairly', 'believably', 'strike', 'rich', 'finance', 'rest', 'trip', 'NC', 'course', 'ripped', 'off', 'forced', 'stay', 'Vegas', 'basically', 'live', 'street', 'Then', 'Eric', 'Jordan', 'Brower', 'whom', ""n't"", 'realize', 'underage', 'male', 'prostitute', 'Eric', 'become', 'friends', 'living', 'Eric', 'abandoned', 'building', 'just', 'really', 'seedy', 'weekly', 'hotel', 'place.Apparently', 'here', 'where', 'story', 'get', 'hackneyed', 'disjointed', 'course', 'can', 'ultimately', 'follow', 'story', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'flow', 'necessary', 'keep', 'tensions', 'high', 'when', 'need', 'be', 'emotions', 'steady', 'when', 'need', 'be.Eric', 'course', 'cute', 'bug', 'clean', 'cut', 'non-drug', 'using', 'prostitute', 'heart', 'gold', 'are', ""n't"", 'Bradford', 'Bradford', ""n't"", 'gay', 'later', 'fact', 'virgin', 'period', 'Eric', 'out', 'group', 'other', 'teen', 'boys', 'girls', 'are', 'prostitutes', 'thieves', 'just', 'credit', 'screenwriter', 'leading', 'kids', 'are', 'unique', 'identifiable.Jonathon', 'Taylor', 'Thomas', 'Home', 'Improvement', 'fame', 'up', 'slick', 'smoothe', 'buy', 'sexual', 'buy', 'something', 'nice', ""'ll"", 'have', 'sex', 'streetwalker', 'Just', 'what', 'capable', 'actor', 'doing', 'film', 'unknown', 'good', 'part', 'what', 'screenwriter', 'editor', 'decided', 'make', 'character', 'vague', 'lackluster', 'Thomas', 'villain', 'piece', 'such', 'should', 'know', 'more', ""don't.Darryl"", 'Hanna', 'up', 'former', 'female', 'prostitute', 'heart', 'gold', 'dating', 'cop', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'best', 'friend', 'Eric', 'mother', 'who', 'abandoned', 'got', ""'ve"", 'always', 'thought', 'Hanna', 'was', 'actor-lite', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'sure', 'how', 'managed', 'get', 'many', 'parts', 'Here', 'fairly', 'creepy', 'scene', 'Hanna', 'pushing', '40', ""n't"", 'deflowers', 'little', 'star', 'Bradford', 'favor', 'little', 'buddy', 'Eric', 'who', 'nuts', 'thought', 'Bradford', 'having', 'sex', 'someone', 'other', 'credit', 'Brower', 'young', 'character', 'believable', 'charismatic.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'farther', 'detailing', 'plot', 'have', 'touching', 'interesting', 'twist', 'one', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'dozens', 'films', 'similar', 'genre', 'Sharkey', 'Machine', 'My', 'Own', 'Private', 'Idaho', 'other', 'film', 'where', 'good-hearted', 'hooker', 'love', 'respectable', 'person', '.It', 'not', 'BAD', 'film', 'not', 'fact', 'think', 'better', 'edit', 'job', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'beefier', 'script', 'editor', 'could', 'be', 'supremely', 'better.Make', 'mistakes', 'drama', 'slow', 'one', 'However', 'performances', 'make', 'worth', 'watching', 'even', 'script', 'lacking.I', 'do', 'recommend', 'film', 'far', 'better', 'many', 'other', 'gay', 'genre', 'prostitute', 'genre', 'films', 'such', 'No', 'One', 'Sleeps', 'other', 'film', 'Wolf', 'Video', 'fact', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'executive', 'producer', 'have', 'had', 'hand', 'aspects', 'film.Check', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'fully', 'satisfying', 'venture']",Speedway Junky

Eric (played by Jordan Brower) is experienced and gay; Johnny (Jesse Bradford) is a novice and straight.Johnny has run away from home to gamble his savings in Las Vegas in the hopes of becoming a stock car racer in North Carolina.  In separate moments of distraction and panic, he loses his money and his duffel bag, leaving him destitute.  Eric, attracted to Johnny, takes him in.  Eric introduces Johnny to a group of young delinquents, whose dominant personality is Steve (Jonathan Taylor Thomas).  Eric and Steve are eager to help Johnny get oriented and successful.  Johnny rapidly gets used to shoplifting, joyriding, and safekeeping others' drug stuff, but the sexual and romantic sides of Johnny are more complicated.Johnny is straight and would like nothing better than to have his first success at giving a woman an orgasm.  He gets opportunities, some comic and some injurious, with a newly-wed, a high-class hustler, two beauties [photographed for Playboy!], and with a more mature friend of Eric's mother (Veronica, played by Daryl Hannah).  Not many normal men, much less a down-and-out teen, would get such a string of scoring opportunities.  Still, it's just the thrill of the sex itself to him.Meanwhile, Eric has fallen in love with Johnny and does what he can to build the relationship.  Eric has Veronica as an understanding confidante.  Although Johnny starts out bawling out his shock at meeting a chickenhawk, Johnny slowly gets more assured and trusting with the gay Eric and eventually offers to take Eric away with him on an undefined basis to North Carolina.The action accelerates when Steve has an immediate need for cash and finds a willingness to do what it takes to get himself out of the bind, regardless of the consequences to Eric or Johnny.The movie is nicely acted  (I especially liked Jordan Brower's performance as Eric.) and photographed.The movie-makers do not present a single view of how to take the film.Certainly, despite the topic, it is not a titillating skin flick.  The only depictions of prostitution are of getting into or out of cars and a comic scene where Johnny is picked up momentarily by a fancy female prostitute.  Johnny goes shirtless some, as does a significant drug dealer once.  One woman takes her blouse off, keeping her large bra on.  Eric jumps from afar into a swimming pool.  The film is about relationships, not titillation, nor is the movie a condemnation of street life.The relationships are tricky.  Eric loves Johnny.  Johnny thinks Eric is the best friend he ever had.  Still Johnny and Eric both have (different) relationships with Veronica, and Johnny's plans won't include Eric forever.  At the movie's end, it is not clear whether Johnny thinks of Eric or Veronica at all or if they are filed away as a weird, unmentionable interlude in Las Vegas.  The audience will have to decide whether Eric or Johnny is the moral focus of the film and what the film is to mean.",3,Unrequiteable Love,1024012800,"06 14, 2002",2002,3031,"['Speedway', 'Junky', 'growing', 'relationship', 'two', 'teenaged', 'hustlers', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'Eric', 'played', 'Jordan', 'Brower', 'experienced', 'gay', 'Johnny', 'Jesse', 'Bradford', 'novice', 'straight.Johnny', 'run', 'away', 'home', 'gamble', 'savings', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'hopes', 'becoming', 'stock', 'car', 'racer', 'North', 'Carolina', 'separate', 'moments', 'distraction', 'panic', 'money', 'duffel', 'bag', 'leaving', 'destitute', 'Eric', 'attracted', 'Johnny', 'Eric', 'introduces', 'Johnny', 'group', 'young', 'delinquents', 'dominant', 'personality', 'Steve', 'Jonathan', 'Taylor', 'Thomas', 'Eric', 'Steve', 'are', 'eager', 'help', 'Johnny', 'get', 'oriented', 'successful', 'Johnny', 'rapidly', 'used', 'shoplifting', 'joyriding', 'safekeeping', 'others', 'drug', 'stuff', 'sexual', 'romantic', 'sides', 'Johnny', 'are', 'more', 'complicated.Johnny', 'straight', 'would', 'like', 'nothing', 'better', 'have', 'first', 'success', 'giving', 'woman', 'orgasm', 'opportunities', 'comic', 'injurious', 'newly-wed', 'high-class', 'hustler', 'two', 'beauties', '[', 'photographed', 'Playboy', ']', 'more', 'mature', 'friend', 'Eric', 'mother', 'Veronica', 'played', 'Daryl', 'Hannah', 'Not', 'many', 'normal', 'men', 'much', 'less', 'down-and-out', 'teen', 'would', 'get', 'such', 'string', 'scoring', 'opportunities', 'Still', 'just', 'thrill', 'sex', 'him.Meanwhile', 'Eric', 'fallen', 'love', 'Johnny', 'what', 'can', 'build', 'relationship', 'Eric', 'Veronica', 'understanding', 'confidante', 'Johnny', 'out', 'bawling', 'out', 'shock', 'meeting', 'chickenhawk', 'Johnny', 'slowly', 'more', 'assured', 'trusting', 'gay', 'Eric', 'eventually', 'take', 'Eric', 'away', 'undefined', 'basis', 'North', 'Carolina.The', 'action', 'when', 'Steve', 'immediate', 'need', 'cash', 'willingness', 'do', 'what', 'get', 'bind', 'regardless', 'consequences', 'Eric', 'Johnny.The', 'movie', 'nicely', 'acted', 'especially', 'liked', 'Jordan', 'Brower', 'performance', 'Eric', 'photographed.The', 'movie-makers', 'do', 'not', 'present', 'single', 'view', 'how', 'take', 'film.Certainly', 'topic', 'not', 'titillating', 'skin', 'flick', 'only', 'depictions', 'prostitution', 'are', 'getting', 'cars', 'comic', 'scene', 'where', 'Johnny', 'picked', 'up', 'momentarily', 'fancy', 'female', 'prostitute', 'Johnny', 'shirtless', 'significant', 'drug', 'dealer', 'once', 'One', 'woman', 'blouse', 'keeping', 'large', 'bra', 'Eric', 'jumps', 'afar', 'swimming', 'pool', 'film', 'relationships', 'not', 'titillation', 'movie', 'condemnation', 'street', 'life.The', 'relationships', 'are', 'tricky', 'Eric', 'loves', 'Johnny', 'Johnny', 'Eric', 'best', 'friend', 'ever', 'had', 'Still', 'Johnny', 'Eric', 'have', 'different', 'relationships', 'Veronica', 'Johnny', 'plans', 'wo', ""n't"", 'include', 'Eric', 'forever', 'movie', 'end', 'not', 'clear', 'Johnny', 'thinks', 'Eric', 'Veronica', 'are', 'filed', 'away', 'weird', 'unmentionable', 'interlude', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'audience', 'will', 'have', 'decide', 'Eric', 'Johnny', 'moral', 'focus', 'film', 'what', 'film', 'mean']",Speedway Junky

700344,A14JEURPY1CXZB,B000065U4B,James D. Leverton,"[6, 7]","I've never recommended a DVD solely for the director's commentary before, but I'm doing just that with Nickolas Perry's ""Speedway Junky"" (1999).  The film itself is a totally predictable, sanitized view of Las Vegas street hustlers that contains two very good performances (one by someone you'd never expect), one terrible performance by a badly miscast former child star and a dual ending that is both misguided and, in the case of the tacked-on ""happy"" ending, insulting to the audience's intelligence.  In all, ""Speedway Junky"" is a definite mixed bag; however, the DVD version is redeemed by an excellent director's commentary in which writer/director Perry provides an honest critique of his own work and gives an invaluable lesson on the process of making an independent film in today's Hollywood.Jesse Bradford, who as a child gave one of 1992's best performances in Steven Soderberg's forgotten gem ""King of the Hill,"" stars as Johnny, a teenage drifter who is hitchhiking from Los Angeles to Daytona Beach to join the Nascar circuit as a pit crew worker.  To fund his journey, he takes a detour to Las Vegas, hoping to parlay his meager assets into enough money to complete his trip and then live on until he finds work.  Unfortunately, within minutes of his arrival in town, he loses his money and all his possessions.  His circumstances look bleak until he catches the eye of Eric (Jordan Brower), a gay teenage street hustler who falls in love with him at first sight and takes him in.  Eric also initiates him into his seedy world and extended family, including his adopted ""mother,"" an ex-showgirl and junky wonderfully played by Daryl Hannah, and various friends and ""associates,"" including a shady fellow hustler named Steven (Jonathan Taylor Thomas).  Although Johnny is straight, he and Eric form a strong friendship and bond which gets them both through the bleak days ahead, as Johnny vainly tries to earn money by hustling women and Eric's shady friends threaten their very existence.The main problem with ""Speedway Junky"" is that it so predictable that the audience will know exactly how it is going end almost from the moment it starts.  It is also extremely derivative of countless earlier, and better, films, including its obvious main source of inspiration--John Schlesinger's 1969 Oscar winner ""Midnight Cowboy.""  As for the performances, they are uneven, to say the least.  Jesse Bradford is an excellent young actor, but he overacts constantly and gives a totally annoying performance as Johnny, which isn't good when you are the film's hero.  And poor Jonathan Taylor Thomas is simply horrible as the devious hustler Steven; in fact, after the shock value of hearing the clean-cut former child star use four letter words and graphically describe anal sex is over, his entire act becomes tiresome until late in the film when he is required to become vicious and then he is laughable.  On the other hand, Hannah is wonderful as a faded beauty who has hit rock-bottom, and Tiffani-Amber Thiessen and Patsy Kensit have  nice cameos as two of Johnny's potential female ""tricks.""  And then there's Jordan Brower, who is simply wonderful as Eric, giving the kind of eye-opening, and wholly unexpected, performance that in a better, and more widely-seen, film would have brought him a great deal of attention.  He is simply working at a level the rest of the cast, with the exception of Hannah, don't come close to reaching.  In fact, his scenes with Hannah provide all of the film's best, and most realistic moments.  (Take special note of Eric's ""breakdown"" scene which is beautifully rendered.)As for the film's other problems, they are numerous and start with the weak screenplay, which ends by trashing the most sympathetic character in the film and then tacks on a happy ending that is unbelievable, to say the least.  But don't take my word for it, just listen to writer/director Perry's own commentary, which leads me back to where I began.  The commentary is extremely illuminating in that Perry explains every single detail of the production of the film and why he did the things he did.  Why did he add a silly, and unnecessary chase scene halfway through?  Why was Jonathan Taylor-Thomas cast in a role he was clearly wrong for?  Why does he have a long and boring credit sequence at the beginning when it clearly hurts the flow of the film?  And why the heck did he trash the one gay character in the film and not predict that audiences would hate him for it?  For that matter, why did he include the ridiculous final scene?  He answers all these questions and in the process teaches us all that even in today's independent film world, to get financing for a film you have to make the same kind of compromises that are necessary when working with the studios.  It is an eye-opening lesson, to be sure, and one that all aspiring filmmakers would do well to learn from.In all, ""Speedway Junky"" is a failure, and an extremely unlucky one at that.  After sitting on the shelf for two years it finally received a theatrical run at the Regent Theater in Los Angeles starting on August 30, 2001.  Eleven days later the twin towers fell and moviegoing did a nose-dive, ending whatever chance this film had of having a theatrical life.  It's right where it belongs--on DVD, with its excellent commentary giving it a reason for existence.  ** (out of *****) for the film and **** for the commentary.",3,"Watch it with the director's

I already loved Daryl Hannah and Jesse Bradford from past movies but this movie is excellent.  It brings you to so many different emotions.  You get angry with Johnny when Eric goes through the pain of losing someone he loves because Johnny wont just be honest with him.  You basically want Stephen dead throughout the movie because hes a self centered, conceited and rather violent prositute who lets people die for things that he did with no regret.  You gotta love Eric.  I mean hes the one truly honest person that Johnny runs into in Vegas aside from Veronica (Hannah), who is pretty much a mother to Johnny and Eric throughout the film who teaches them from her past mistakes as a hooker in vegas(one in particular time being when johnny shows an interest in being a hustler and she sits in front of him blatantly telling him an un cencored story of a trick in which she was stabbed almost to the point of death.)  These characters in the movie (aside from hannah and bradford &lt;who is rather young as well>) are children.  Pez Boy appears to be about 16 years old and the others are no more than 18 (i believe johnnys about 18).  Their poor kids who sell their bodies to 40 year old men so that they wont starve.  Its also a movie about hope.  Johnny wants to be a race car driver and gains most of his skill by his obsessive playing of the arcade came SPEEDWAY.  He also wants to take Eric with him.  Its also a love story.  Johnny is stait but is obviously in love with Eric and does admit it a time or two though he cannot have a relationship because, well, hes strait.  There is a time though that he yells at Eric ""i DO care about you.  Thats why im here!"". In its rawest form its a story of a kid that left home to make bus fair in vegas with 20 bucks in his pocket to put in the slots who gets robbed and gets stuck there until he can make the money for the bus.  He runs into a group of hustlers outside in the casino parking lot.  And basically what happens.  He sees Stephen prancing around in Nice clothes and a big wad of cash and doesnt know how far stephen goes for that money.  Veronica and Eric tell him that he needs to forget about it because its dangerous (veronica- who use to be a hustler and Eric who still is).  And in the movie you see the transition.  I mean he starts the movie as a country boy playing video games in a diner on his way to Vegas and then you see him as a cut up waif chainsmoking in the car running from the cops in a police chase through the city.anyways.. just see it..

I tend to like trashy films depicting the seedy side of life.  Speedway Junky is one of those.  The writer/director Nicholas Perry did a pretty good job.  But even with Gus Van Sant as one of the executive producers, it didn't quite come off as edgy enough.The film stars Jesse Bradford as Johnny, an army brat who has run away from home to become a race car driver.  He's aiming for the NASCAR racing scene in Charlotte, North Carolina.  The problem is that he only gets as far as Las Vegas where his money and all his possessions are stolen.  Here, he meets up Eric, played by Jordon Brower, a young gay hustler who falls in love with Johnny.  Even though Johnny is not gay, the two of them become friends, with Eric helping Johnny out of one scrape after another.  Daryl Hanna is cast as a former prostitute who was a friend of Eric's late mother and helps out the boys. It's a good role for her and shows her acting ability.  In fact, all the acting is really good and the relationship between the two young men portrayed well.I watched the film with interest but couldn't get into it.  I just didn't seem real enough.  And even though there were several erotic scenes and a peppering of violence, it all seemed like an overblown soap opera and I didn't feel any real emotion.
