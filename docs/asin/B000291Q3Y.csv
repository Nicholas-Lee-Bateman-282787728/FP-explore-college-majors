With that in mind, no other season was better than season 1!  In the first episodes of season 1, ""the Fonz"" still wore a simple cloth jacket and spoke only to offer a few simple words of wisdom.  He left you wanting more (as opposed to the final years when it was all about him)!  Richie was the shy, clean-cut kid in all of us who wanted to be ""bad"", but he was just too darn ""good""!  Throw in Ralph, Potsie, and even Mr. C. (before he got too preachy in later years) and you've got the best season ever!  The main downsides are that season one was short (only 16 episodes), and that Paramount was too lazy/cheap to include any ""extras"" like interviews with the cast, bloopers, or even clips from the reunion show.

827343,A1IKOYZVFHO1XP,B000291Q3Y,andy8047,"[4, 7]","Garry Marshall and two of his friends created this nostalgic sitcom. Like CBS's All In The Family,it would spin off and handful of other sitcoms. In the case of Happy Days,it would later spin off Laverne & Shirley,Mork & Mindy and the disappointing Joanie Loves Chachi. Happy Days premiered on February 1,1974 as did CBS's Good Times. That same day,Ron Howard as Richie Cunningham celebrated his twentieth birthday. He was already a TV veteran playing Opie Taylor on CBS's The Andy Griffith Show. Howard had top billing through the 1979-80 season(he left HD after that season). HD was first set in the late 1950's in Milwaukee,Wisconsin. Henry Winkler is Arthur ""Fonz"" Fonzarelli,a black leather-clad motorcyclist who would often give Richie advice on how to score with girls. Marion Ross is Marion,mother of Richie and his sister Joanie(Erin Moran). Richie's and Joanie's father is Howard(Tom Bosley) who owns and operates a hardware store. Richie and Fonz often hung out a neighborhood restaurant,Arnold's. Arnold was Oriental,played by Pat Morita,who'd later appear in The Karate Kid movies. Richie attended Jefferson High School during this season with some other buddies,Ralph Malph(Donny Most) and Warren ""Potsie"" Weber(Anson Williams). Richie's schoolmates hung out at Arnold's as well,occasionally bringing their dates,some turning out to be girlfriends. The first season theme was ROCK AROUND THE CLOCK,the hit song recorded by Bill Haley & The Comets(on Hit Parade in 1955). You can see Joanie with her long hair in a ponytail(this became a fad in 1954). You can also see Richie,Potsie and Ralph wearing button-down sweaters with their JHS colors and insignia also.

Fonzie mostly wears windbreaker jackets instead of leather (he does wear the leather jacket once in a while). He doesn't say a lot, but in my opinion this seemed to work well (less is more sometimes). At this point Ralph was a character that went out of his way to make slight fun of Ritchie and Potsie (more so than later seasons it seems).

827356,A343WUP274JSP3,B000291Q3Y,"Da Man ""Da Man""","[45, 46]","I am part of the camp who thinks the earliest seasons of Happy Days were the best.  This first season aired in the first half of 1974, and The Fonz was a smaller character (he's not even in the opening credits in season 1).  However, these early single-camera episodes bring out the best of the series IMO.If you compare these episodes to a season 4 episode for example, you can see vastly different tones for the series (it went live in season 3).  The earlier episodes are a lot more authentic 50's, while it became more and more a product of the 70's and 80's in the latter years.When the show went live, we didn't see as much outside action, as many of the funniest moments of the first season take place outside of Arnold's.I hope Paramount announces season two soon, I love the early (first 4) seasons of this show and will gladly add them to my library as soon as they come out.$39.99 might seem insane for a show without extras,  but these are the uncut (over 25 mins on average) episodes as they haven't been seen since 1974, and as icing on the cake, it is very cool to see the old-school red Paramount tags that have long been replaced at the end.  The only downfall is that some scenes have really dirty prints,  but I am willing to overlook it.

827357,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000291Q3Y,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[93, 98]","How can it possibly be thirty years already since Happy Days first premiered?  That fact makes a guy feel very old, for I can't imagine having grown up without Happy Days; fortunately, being able to watch these classic episodes brings back great memories that almost make me feel young again.  As a little kid growing up in the 70s, Happy Days was - without question - the show.  I was trying to be Fonzie - strutting around, giving thumbs up, and saying Heyyyy! all the time - even before I learned to read.  The show remained a constant presence in my life throughout the 1980s, as well, as it was a staple of after-school programming (back before all the talk shows took over).  The first season's episodes were never really my favorite - mainly because a lot of changes were made at the start of the second season, Richie was a little wild that first year, Joanie was still a few years away from babehood, Fonzie was basically just a peripheral character, and - let's face it - there was just way too much Potsie in these early shows.  In the first season, Potsie was the second-most important character, although Howard and Marion came on strong in the last half of the season.Richie really wasn't a clean-cut paragon of virtue in Season One.  In the very first episode, he set out to go ""All the Way"" with a girl who had a ""reputation.""  Over the course of the next fifteen shows, he came home drunk (accompanied by a stripper) from a Marine's bachelor party, got arrested after he snuck out of the house to attend a drag race, put himself through ""The Deadly Dares"" in order to join The Demons, used a fake ID to get into a strip club, lost his band mates' money in a poker game, came close to leaving home with a bunch of beatniks, almost got a tattoo to impress a girl, and almost got himself into a rumble with The Dukes.  Of course, he learned important lessons from all of his adventures - except the lesson that he should stop going along with all of Potsie's hare-brained schemes and plans.  There are some truly classic moments in these first 16 episodes, such as Fonzie selecting Richie (in drag) to dance at the sock hop, Richie's first drunk in ""Richie's Cup Runneth Over"" and Richie's blind date with a really tall girl in ""Because She's There.""The gang's all here for the most part, but Ralph Malph is just a jokester you see at Arnold's or parties/dances, and Fonzie is largely just the local king of cool.  Both characters' presence tends to increase as the season progresses, but the only real character development we see of Arthur Fonzarelli comes when Fonzie decides to go back to high school in ""Fonzie Drops In.""  Then, of course, there's Chuck, the infamous oldest son of the Cunninghams who simply disappears after this first season.  The question is not really why his character was purged from the show with such Stalinist diligence; instead, it's why was he ever there to start with?  He did nothing on the show except dribble a basketball.It's interesting to see how the show became a little more serious as the first season drew to a close.  While thoughts of making out with girls were never far from Richie's mind, we witness a rather poignant example of growing up when Richie and Howard square off over the beatnik way of life, see the show take racism head-on in ""The Best Man"" when Howard has his black army buddy's wedding at his house in spite of his neighbors' protests, and take a moment to reflect on the dangers of the nascent Cold War and the A bomb back in the 1950s.I hope this Happy Days Season One collection sells like hotcakes because I want all of the other seasons ASAP.  I like the next few seasons better, but a lot of fans probably have a special love for these early episodes.  If you're a rabid Fonzie fan, don't expect to see the Fonz you know and love in these first season shows, though - there are only glimpses of the central character he would become.  Keep in mind, as well, that there are only 16 shows in this first season - Happy Days debuted on January 15, 1974.  There are also no extras whatsoever included on these 3 DVDs, a fact which is quite disappointing.  Frankly, that means this collection is overpriced.  At least we have the episodes themselves, though - and that is a treasure in and of itself.",5,Happy Days are here again,1104451200,"12 31, 2004",2004,4279,"['How', 'can', 'possibly', 'be', 'thirty', 'years', 'already', 'Happy', 'Days', 'first', 'premiered', 'fact', 'guy', 'feel', 'very', 'old', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'having', 'grown', 'up', 'Happy', 'Days', 'fortunately', 'being', 'able', 'watch', 'classic', 'episodes', 'back', 'great', 'memories', 'almost', 'make', 'feel', 'young', 'again', 'little', 'kid', 'growing', 'up', '70s', 'Happy', 'Days', 'was', 'question', 'show', 'was', 'trying', 'be', 'Fonzie', 'strutting', 'around', 'giving', 'thumbs', 'up', 'saying', 'Heyyyy', 'time', 'even', 'learned', 'read', 'show', 'remained', 'constant', 'presence', 'life', '1980s', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'staple', 'after-school', 'programming', 'back', 'talk', 'took', 'over', 'first', 'season', 'episodes', 'were', 'never', 'really', 'favorite', 'mainly', 'lot', 'changes', 'were', 'made', 'start', 'second', 'season', 'Richie', 'was', 'little', 'wild', 'first', 'year', 'Joanie', 'was', 'still', 'few', 'years', 'away', 'babehood', 'Fonzie', 'was', 'basically', 'just', 'peripheral', 'character', 'let', 'face', 'was', 'just', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'Potsie', 'early', 'shows', 'first', 'season', 'Potsie', 'was', 'second-most', 'important', 'character', 'Howard', 'Marion', 'came', 'strong', 'last', 'half', 'season.Richie', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'clean-cut', 'paragon', 'virtue', 'Season', 'One', 'very', 'first', 'episode', 'set', 'out', 'go', 'Way', 'girl', 'who', 'had', 'reputation', 'course', 'next', 'fifteen', 'shows', 'came', 'home', 'drunk', 'accompanied', 'stripper', 'Marine', 'bachelor', 'party', 'got', 'arrested', 'snuck', 'house', 'attend', 'drag', 'race', 'put', 'Deadly', 'Dares', 'order', 'join', 'Demons', 'used', 'fake', 'ID', 'get', 'strip', 'club', 'lost', 'band', 'mates', 'money', 'poker', 'game', 'came', 'close', 'leaving', 'home', 'bunch', 'beatniks', 'almost', 'got', 'tattoo', 'impress', 'girl', 'almost', 'got', 'rumble', 'Dukes', 'course', 'learned', 'important', 'lessons', 'adventures', 'lesson', 'should', 'stop', 'going', 'Potsie', 'hare-brained', 'schemes', 'plans', 'are', 'truly', 'classic', 'moments', 'first', '16', 'episodes', 'such', 'Fonzie', 'selecting', 'Richie', 'drag', 'dance', 'sock', 'hop', 'Richie', 'first', 'drunk', 'Richie', 'Cup', 'Runneth', 'Over', 'Richie', 'blind', 'date', 'really', 'tall', 'girl', 'gang', 'here', 'most', 'part', 'Ralph', 'Malph', 'just', 'jokester', 'see', 'Arnold', 'parties/dances', 'Fonzie', 'largely', 'just', 'local', 'king', 'cool', 'characters', 'presence', 'tends', 'increase', 'season', 'only', 'real', 'character', 'development', 'see', 'Arthur', 'Fonzarelli', 'when', 'Fonzie', 'go', 'back', 'high', 'school', 'Fonzie', 'Drops', 'Then', 'course', 'Chuck', 'infamous', 'oldest', 'son', 'Cunninghams', 'who', 'simply', 'first', 'season', 'question', 'not', 'really', 'why', 'character', 'was', 'purged', 'show', 'such', 'Stalinist', 'diligence', 'instead', 'why', 'was', 'ever', 'there', 'start', 'did', 'nothing', 'show', 'dribble', 'basketball.It', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'show', 'became', 'little', 'more', 'serious', 'first', 'season', 'drew', 'close', 'thoughts', 'making', 'out', 'girls', 'were', 'never', 'far', 'Richie', 'mind', 'witness', 'rather', 'poignant', 'example', 'growing', 'up', 'when', 'Richie', 'Howard', 'square', 'off', 'beatnik', 'way', 'life', 'see', 'show', 'take', 'racism', 'head-on', 'Best', 'Man', 'when', 'Howard', 'black', 'army', 'buddy', 'wedding', 'house', 'spite', 'neighbors', 'protests', 'take', 'moment', 'reflect', 'dangers', 'nascent', 'Cold', 'War', 'A', 'bomb', 'back', '1950s.I', 'hope', 'Happy', 'Days', 'Season', 'One', 'collection', 'hotcakes', 'want', 'other', 'seasons', 'ASAP', 'next', 'few', 'seasons', 'better', 'lot', 'fans', 'probably', 'have', 'special', 'love', 'early', 'episodes', ""'re"", 'rabid', 'Fonzie', 'fan', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'see', 'Fonz', 'know', 'love', 'first', 'season', 'shows', 'are', 'only', 'glimpses', 'central', 'character', 'would', 'become', 'Keep', 'mind', 'as', 'well', 'are', 'only', '16', 'shows', 'first', 'season', 'Happy', 'Days', 'debuted', 'January', '15', '1974', 'are', 'also', 'extras', 'whatsoever', 'included', '3', 'DVDs', 'fact', 'quite', 'disappointing', 'Frankly', 'collection', 'overpriced', 'least', 'have', 'episodes', 'treasure']",N/A

Howard played Richie Cunningham a teenager growing up in the fifties. The episodes centered around his family and group of friends who all hung out at ""Arnolds"" the local diner. Originally the show was only marginally successful, but thanks to reruns being aired weekday mornings in the summer it gained a sizable following.  The character of Fonzie in particular became the focus of later episodes while the character of Richie became just one of the guys.  In these early episodes, Fonzie was only a supporting character who mostly gave out advice to the rest of the gang while leaning next to his motorcycle in  Arnold's parking lot.  Potsie was Richie's best friend and occasionally they would hang out with their friend Ralph Malph.  On the home front was Richie's parents Howard and Marion, little sister Joanie and big brother Chuck.(who disappeared after season one and was never mentioned again).  I enjoyed these early episodes and often wished the show would have continued in this direction.  Fonzie was a great character and I always enjoyed his appearances, however making him the central focus of the show was too much for me.  Later in the series, they started filming before a live audience which also significantly changed the tone of the show.

The first few seasons were the best.First, it was much truer to the 50's.  Versus later episodes where male characters had long hair (parted in the middle)....typical 70's.  How the ""Chachi"" character was ever allowed to look the way he did, is beyond me.  I stopped watching Happy Days altogether, around the time Ron Howard left.  When Scott Bao began was the true end of the show as we have known it previously.Also, pathetic were the Potsi & Ralph character following Scott Bao around like a puppy dog.  Another nail in the coffin was the character who played the high school coach in the later years (name escapes me), but he was a typical hunk, heart throb type.  Totally brought nothing to the show, and was likely to pick up where the Fonzi character was declining.But back to the real happy days. I liked the quieter, more reserved, and less exposed Fonzi of the early seasons.  He was even cool with the nylon wind-breaker (before he was assinged a leather jacket).The over exposure of his character in the later episode totally de-mystified him, and made him ""too human,"" toward the end of the show.  Good example of a character staying too long;  but more likely the show stayed beyond its quality content.I for one will purchase the early episodes, because for me, there was no Happy Days beyond those.",5,Early Episodes are in a class by themselves,1109462400,"02 27, 2005",2005,1413,"['just', 'got', 'finished', 'reading', 'few', 'reviews', 'echoed', 'what', 'have', 'always', 'said', 'series', 'first', 'few', 'seasons', 'were', 'best.First', 'was', 'much', 'truer', '50', 'Versus', 'later', 'where', 'male', 'characters', 'had', 'long', 'hair', 'parted', 'middle', '.typical', '70', 'How', 'Chachi', 'character', 'was', 'ever', 'allowed', 'look', 'way', 'did', 'stopped', 'watching', 'Happy', 'Days', 'altogether', 'time', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'left', 'When', 'Scott', 'Bao', 'began', 'was', 'true', 'end', 'show', 'have', 'known', 'previously.Also', 'pathetic', 'were', 'Potsi', 'Ralph', 'character', 'following', 'Scott', 'Bao', 'puppy', 'dog', 'nail', 'coffin', 'was', 'character', 'who', 'played', 'high', 'school', 'coach', 'later', 'years', 'name', 'was', 'typical', 'hunk', 'heart', 'throb', 'type', 'Totally', 'brought', 'nothing', 'show', 'was', 'likely', 'pick', 'up', 'where', 'Fonzi', 'character', 'was', 'declining.But', 'back', 'real', 'happy', 'days', 'liked', 'quieter', 'more', 'reserved', 'less', 'exposed', 'Fonzi', 'early', 'seasons', 'was', 'even', 'cool', 'nylon', 'wind-breaker', 'was', 'assinged', 'leather', 'jacket', '.The', 'exposure', 'character', 'later', 'episode', 'totally', 'de-mystified', 'made', 'too', 'human', 'end', 'show', 'Good', 'example', 'character', 'staying', 'too', 'long', 'more', 'likely', 'show', 'stayed', 'quality', 'content.I', 'one', 'will', 'purchase', 'early', 'episodes', 'was', 'Happy', 'Days']",N/A

Well, I think there are several reasons.  While Ron Howard, Henry Winkler et al are gifted actors and were excellent on this show, I always knew I was watching actors.  It wasn't until Baio joined the cast that I realized what I was missing.  He WAS Chachi; so much so that I couldn't watch ""Charles in Charge"" for years, because I was so sad that Chachi and Joanie had apparently broken up.So, yes, I'll enjoy ""Happy Days: Season One"", but I will be counting the days until I have the Baio years on DVD.

The first two seasons have the original concept of the TV show ""Happy Days"" which first appeared on the TV show ""Love American Style"" in 1972 as ""Love and the Happy Days.""  Unfortunately, it is not included in the DVD box sets.  BAD POINT.In fact, there is an episode in Season 1 that is a sequel to the pilot.  In the pilot, Richie wants to date this girl named Arlene.  She shows no interest in him until he invites her over to his house to watch TV.  The Cunninghams were one of the first families in the neighborhood to get a TV set.The girl and her parents moved to New York City for three years and now return to Milwalkee.The first two seasons take a comical adult view at growing up in the 1950's in white middle-class America.Someone in review did not like the first season which they purchased for their 11 year old child to watch and were surprised at the adult theme introduced in the first episode.  They said that they shut the TV off and would want to return the set if they could.I would have to tell that person that this was the way the first two seasons wer, but they would not have to worry about the other seasons, because after the second season, ""Happy Days"" begins to be transformed into a live-action Saturday morning cartoon.  In fact, a few years later, it did become a Saturday morning cartoon along with ""Laverne and Shirley.""The TV shows became so cartoony and sugary sweet.  No wonder Ron Howard and Donny Most left the series.  Who can blame them?  And no wonder why Donny Most did not show up to make an appearance on the series finale episode.  Again, who can blame him?The series started out so great and then was trashed.  Yes, I know that the ratings did go up because of Fonzie being given a main role getting the second billing next to Ron Howard in the third season, but at teh beginning of Season 5, that was when the ""Happy Days"" series along with Fonzie, ""jumped the shark"" with regards to the show's popularity and ratings.In closing, I have to say again that Seasons 1 and 2 were the best seasons of ""Happy Days.""However, regarding the ""Happy Days"" Season 2 box set, I see that those THOSE CHEAP, PENNY PINCHING ""nERDS"" at paramount did not want to shell out the money for the rights to use the original 1950's music on the TV episodes and replaced it with lousey generic music like which was used in the later ""Happy Days"" episodes in the later seasons.  ANOTHER BAD POINT.  Those Hollywood Studio Executive ""NERDS.""In fact on one episode int the Season 2 DVD box set in a scene at Arnold's, you see the kids shaking and dancing, but there is no music playing.  Also in some episodes, you have Richie walking down the street thinking about the dilema of the week.

What's more, he brags about it to anyone who crosses his path. Milwaukee must have been pretty freewheeling about those things. Weren't the 1950s a time of finger-wagging morality? The Fonz never got busted on the Mann Act or even got a black eye from an irate, club-wielding father. Apparently the entire city and law enforcement establishment was in absolute, dumbstruck awe of his coolness. What's more, he stood about five-foot-six. The Fonz was a pervert, even in Season One. How this pint-sized lecher and deadbeat became a cultural icon makes you think H.L. Mencken was right about the American public. (I doubt the Fonz could take a 12-year-old girl in a fight.) That aside, Happy Days was a great show in its first two seasons, when it was filmed with the one-camera technique, and attempted to capture 1950s detail through a lovingly nostalgic filter. Later it became garbage, of course, when it went live, with '70s shag hairdos and inane catch-phrases and obnoxious hooting from the studio audiences and Fonzie jumping the shark.

Along with season two, it has a completely different tone then the rest of the series. It was the tone the series should have continued to follow. The forst two sesaons were shot like a movie with no multi-camera shots and no live audience and was a very nostalgic look at a simplier time in America. Starting with sesaon three the episodes didn't seem to be in the right time period or even have the correct hairstyles of the times. The first two years were the best, but the show still managed to be entertaining for a couple more seasons. I remember back to the night when Fonzie jumped a shark that was in a caged area in the ocean! I remember saying to myself that it was the beginning of the end for this show!.....if I only knew then what that remark would end up meaning today! I couldn't believe my eyes, the first time I heard about the book and site ""Jump the Shark"". I guess I wasn't the only person who thought or said something like that watching that episode.

It's the retro-50s, 1970s homage to America, mom and apple pie, all tinged in that inimitable 70s raunchy lack of good taste. Inspired by George Lucas' motion picture, ""American Graffiti"" this television series introduced us to the Cunningham family, made Henry Winkler's ""the Fonz"" an over night superstar and gave Ron Howard's career a new lease in Hollywood as the teenage innocent, Richie. An instant smash with audiences, the show successfully launched several television spin offs, including the highly successful ""Lavern & Shirley.""Season One of this memorable television series includes the episode in which Ralph Malph (Donny Most) coaxes Richie into faking is I.D. in order to get into a burlesque show with an exotic dancer; the episode in which Fonzie re-enrolls in high school with the expectation that Richie will help him pass by any means possible; and the hilarious coming of age reality check episode in which both Richie and Potsie attend a wild bachelor party and develop magnificent hangovers for their revelry efforts.  (Aside: for those expecting the trade mark ""Happy Days"" theme song to accompany your viewing experience - you can forget it.  The series original title track was Bill Haley's classic `Rock Around The Clock.'Paramount's DVD is not nearly as pristine as one would have liked. There is an excessive amount of film grain present as well as age related artifacts and general grit throughout these episodes that generally distracts. There's also a soft characteristic inherent in most of the transfers so that fine detail is never fully realized. Colors can be well balanced but flesh tones tend to have a pasty, faded and overly pink characteristic. Black and contrast levels are never entirely solid or right on. The overall characteristic of the picture quality is inconsistent. The audio is mono and generally cleaned up. There are no extras.

He spent his spare time when off duty from his job at Jiffy-Lube hanging out in the men's room of a diner with teenage boys. The Fonz thought hanging out in the crapper was so chill that he even had a desk brought in there! Weird stuff, folks. We're in Micheal Jackson territory here. Plus, with that greasy fast food Al cooked, it must have smelled great in there! Pass the TP, Fonzie!2.) If the Fonz was so cool, why did he hang out with high school kids? Not just any high school kids, but NERDS like Ritchie, Malph, Potsie et al. Where were the Fonz's biker friends? If you want to look skinny, hang around fat people. If you want to look cool, hang around with geeks. And the parents of geeks. (Sorry, Mister C!)2.)The Fonz must only get paid minimum wage, because he can't even afford his own telephone. He monopolizes the pay phone at Arnold's Diner and grouches at other people who need to make calls. Hey Fonz, get your own damn telephone! Only pathetic losers on welfare rely on public telephones for their primary source of communication.3.) Every cool guy has a cool crib. Now consider the Fonz: He lives in a cramped, creepy 1-room apartment over the Cunnigham's garage, where he sleeps on an old fold-out couch. He has posters of other men on the wall. For some reason, I always pictured the Unabomber living in a place just like Fonzie's digs.  That apartment probably violated zoning regulations, too. What a pathetic fleapit.5.)The Fonz does not drink liquor or smoke cigarettes, or reefers. The riskiest behavior the Fonz engages in is riding his ""bike"" without a helmet, which his helmet-head hair renders unecessary anayway. No one even thought smoking was unhealthy in the 50s. But the geeky Fonz gives public-service lectures anytime someone fires up a butt! Why doesn't the Fonz go out after work and get loaded, instead of drinking milk & cookies with Mrs. C and other old geezers?6.) The Fonz wore the same outfit every day. Didn't anyone tell the Fonz that no one wears white after Labor Day? Plus his leather jacket was cheap looking brown plastic. In some old episodes he even wears penny loafers!7.) The Fonz's idea of literature is a girlie magazine or car-repair manual. The Fonz dropped out of high school to emabark on a lucrative career changing people's oil. Despite his three word vocabulary and 9th grade education, countless adults and children flock to Fonz for advice on career planning, tax shelters, 401(k) rollovers, translations of San Skrit tablets, water-skiing challenges, fencing duels, ballroom dancing, and how to get red-wine stains off chiffon. He's a Fonz-of-all-trades. Milwaukee must have a real lack of professional services. Fonzie even went back to school and taught shop to the next generation of underachieving losers.8.) The Fonz was afraid of liver. He also couldn't say he was wrong. He said ""I was wruuu-g"" What a tool!9.)Everyone wants Fonz's dating advice, but most of his chicks are pretty ugly and either 10 years old or sixty-two. And he's with a different one every show, so maybe all the motorcycle riding took a toll on the Fonzarelli family jewels.In summation, the Fonz is a short, homely, middle-aged dork who lords his ""coolness"" over a gaggle of high school geeks and their lame parents.  Henry Winkler must have been the greatest actor of all time to make a generation believe the Fonz was cool. If you want to see authentic 1950s rebels, watch James Dean or Steve McQueen or Brando. Don't be sold short (pun intended) by the cheesy, politically correct Fonz and Gary Marshall's dreck-fest of a program.",4,"Sorry, but ""The Fonz"" was Not Cool",1131926400,"11 14, 2005",2005,3704,"['Here', 'are', 'reasons', 'why', 'Fonz', 'not', 'cool:1', 'old', 'saying', 'Have', 'cool', 'will', 'travel', 'Fonz', 'never', 'travelled', 'spent', 'spare', 'time', 'when', 'off', 'duty', 'job', 'Jiffy-Lube', 'hanging', 'out', 'men', 'room', 'diner', 'teenage', 'boys', 'Fonz', 'thought', 'hanging', 'out', 'crapper', 'was', 'so', 'chill', 'even', 'had', 'desk', 'brought', 'there', 'Weird', 'stuff', 'folks', ""'re"", 'Micheal', 'Jackson', 'territory', 'here', 'greasy', 'fast', 'food', 'Al', 'cooked', 'must', 'have', 'smelled', 'great', 'Pass', 'TP', 'Fonzie', '2', 'Fonz', 'was', 'so', 'cool', 'why', 'did', 'hang', 'out', 'high', 'school', 'kids', 'Not', 'just', 'high', 'school', 'kids', 'NERDS', 'Ritchie', 'Malph', 'Potsie', 'al', 'Where', 'were', 'Fonz', 'biker', 'friends', 'want', 'look', 'skinny', 'hang', 'fat', 'people', 'want', 'look', 'cool', 'hang', 'geeks', 'parents', 'geeks', 'Sorry', 'Mister', 'C', '2', 'Fonz', 'must', 'only', 'get', 'paid', 'minimum', 'wage', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'afford', 'own', 'telephone', 'pay', 'phone', 'Arnold', 'Diner', 'grouches', 'other', 'people', 'who', 'need', 'make', 'calls', 'Hey', 'Fonz', 'get', 'own', 'damn', 'telephone', 'Only', 'pathetic', 'losers', 'welfare', 'rely', 'public', 'telephones', 'primary', 'source', 'communication.3', 'cool', 'guy', 'cool', 'crib', 'Now', 'consider', 'Fonz', 'cramped', 'creepy', '1-room', 'apartment', 'Cunnigham', 'garage', 'where', 'old', 'fold-out', 'couch', 'posters', 'other', 'men', 'wall', 'reason', 'always', 'pictured', 'Unabomber', 'living', 'place', 'just', 'Fonzie', 'digs', 'apartment', 'probably', 'violated', 'zoning', 'regulations', 'too', 'What', 'pathetic', 'fleapit.5', 'Fonz', 'not', 'drink', 'liquor', 'smoke', 'cigarettes', 'reefers', 'riskiest', 'behavior', 'Fonz', 'engages', 'riding', 'bike', 'helmet', 'helmet-head', 'hair', 'renders', 'unecessary', 'anayway', 'one', 'even', 'thought', 'smoking', 'was', 'unhealthy', '50s', 'geeky', 'Fonz', 'public-service', 'lectures', 'anytime', 'someone', 'up', 'butt', 'Why', ""n't"", 'Fonz', 'go', 'out', 'work', 'get', 'loaded', 'instead', 'drinking', 'milk', 'cookies', 'Mrs.', 'C', 'other', 'old', 'geezers', '6', 'Fonz', 'wore', 'same', 'outfit', 'day', 'Did', ""n't"", 'anyone', 'tell', 'Fonz', 'one', 'white', 'Labor', 'Day', 'leather', 'jacket', 'was', 'cheap', 'looking', 'brown', 'plastic', 'old', 'episodes', 'even', 'penny', 'loafers', '7', 'Fonz', 'idea', 'literature', 'girlie', 'magazine', 'car-repair', 'manual', 'Fonz', 'dropped', 'high', 'school', 'emabark', 'lucrative', 'career', 'changing', 'people', 'oil', 'three', 'word', 'vocabulary', '9th', 'grade', 'education', 'countless', 'adults', 'children', 'flock', 'Fonz', 'advice', 'career', 'planning', 'tax', 'shelters', '401', 'k', 'rollovers', 'translations', 'San', 'Skrit', 'tablets', 'water-skiing', 'challenges', 'fencing', 'duels', 'ballroom', 'dancing', 'how', 'get', 'red-wine', 'stains', 'off', 'chiffon', 'Fonz-of-all-trades', 'Milwaukee', 'must', 'have', 'real', 'lack', 'professional', 'services', 'Fonzie', 'even', 'went', 'back', 'school', 'taught', 'shop', 'next', 'generation', 'underachieving', 'losers.8', 'Fonz', 'was', 'afraid', 'liver', 'also', 'could', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'wrong', 'said', 'was', 'wruuu-g', 'What', 'tool', '9', 'Everyone', 'Fonz', 'dating', 'advice', 'most', 'chicks', 'are', 'pretty', 'ugly', 'either', '10', 'years', 'old', 'sixty-two', 'different', 'one', 'show', 'maybe', 'motorcycle', 'riding', 'took', 'toll', 'Fonzarelli', 'family', 'jewels.In', 'summation', 'Fonz', 'short', 'homely', 'middle-aged', 'dork', 'who', 'coolness', 'gaggle', 'high', 'school', 'geeks', 'lame', 'parents', 'Henry', 'Winkler', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'greatest', 'actor', 'time', 'make', 'generation', 'believe', 'Fonz', 'was', 'cool', 'want', 'see', 'authentic', '1950s', 'rebels', 'watch', 'James', 'Dean', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'Brando', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'sold', 'short', 'pun', 'intended', 'cheesy', 'politically', 'correct', 'Fonz', 'Gary', 'Marshall', 'dreck-fest', 'program']",N/A
827395,A3RW1JLHELL4MT,B000291Q3Y,Paul I.,"[4, 5]","This is a really good set. It is a show taking place in the '50s with Richie Cunningham (Ron Howard) and his best friend Potsie (Anson Williams). And also Howard (Tom Bosley) was a real neat father. And also I thought Joanie (Erin Moran) was soo cute! Even in those other seasons. Only thing missing is no special features. The only thing they had written in the back of the box of the Happy Days set as a special feature was English-Mono, Full Screen Format, and Dolby Digital. The picture quality however was better than the reruns they show on TV Land. It still should've had some real Special Features though, I mean come on! This is America's biggest show! They could've at least had the Pilot from ""Love American Style."" But hey, even though they don't have special features, it's still great. This show is somewhat of a classic unlike those other shows like Gunsmoke and Three's Company plus a few other shows. THIS is my favorite show. My favorite episode from this set is probably Richie's Cup Runneth over where Richie attends his friend Potsie's cousin who is in The Navy and his cousin is having a bachelor party. Turns out they have too much to drink. (72 tiny shot glasses of beer!!) Another good one is The Deadly Dares where Richie & Potsie want to join a club called The Demons because the girls seem to get a kick out of those guys with the Demon jackets. But in order to get into the club, they have to perform a number of ""Deadly Dares."" They do all the dares. The 1st one is they make a prank phone call to a shop. 2nd: They kiss the waitress Marsha. 3rd: They tie a Police Officer's shoelace together and the Policeman trips. 4th: They steal a Principal's toupe skating IN SCHOOL! 5th: They sing ""America"" in the theater while Bag & Hank are laughing it off. Then the 6th one: The biggest dare of all... Richie and Potsie have to go out dressed as girls to the Sock-Hop. Richie's date is Fonzie and Potsie's date is Ralph Malph (Donny Most). I'm not gay but I kind of think Ralph is cute. Then, they're Demons but Richie backs out because they don't like Bag or Hank and think (Why hang out with a bunch of bananas?) So they back out. And also the songs are neat too. Except they play Hound Dog-Elvis Presley more often. The songs I liked are those 2 Johnnie Ray songs they played The Little White Cloud that Cried, and Cry. And also the other song I liked was My Prayer-The Platters. The band was playing it at the Sock Hop when Richie was dancing with Fonzie. Those are really Happy Days unlike today. And if you've had a bad day, come, sit down, and enjoy this Happy Days set. And I'm ready for the second season of Happy Days so bring it on!",5,Boring Days?

Happy Days needed to be released on DVD a very long time ago.Although I was unusual in wanting to be like Fonzie to help others (the apparent early stirings of an activist!) and instead wanted to date Warren 'Potsie' Webber (I still cannot remember why I thought he was hot!) I still loved the series. Even in grad school, I schedule afternoon appointments around the time Happy Days comes on the local station so I can watch the series again.The first season is special in it's own right because later-discarded older brother Chuck Cunningham, a nice (if prototypical) all American jock is shown. Fonzie is dressed in a windbreaker jacket to soothe network in-house censors who imagined the series would accidentally promote criminal activity among American youth if that character wore a black leather jacket. Plus, instead of the phenomena which he assumed in later seasons, Fonzie himself is a minor character this season; The show was originally supposed to revolve around the Cunningham family's Cold-War era Wisconsin life.I only hope the studio eventually releases all seasons and does not(as with Charlies Angels) release one or a couple of seasons and then later decide that the public no longer wants to see this show. Syndication on many 2004 cable and network channels clearly indicates the enduring longevity of Happy Days---and so does a leather jacket on permanent display in the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.

I generally prefer no canned laughter but this show is different. The female audience response to Henry Winkler's every entrance in later seasons turned me off. Also, characters like Bag, and in particular poor suffering waitress, Marsha, were used economically well in Season One & Two (""Ritchie, Ive lived with pain and loneliness most of my life...you learn to get used to it"")Seasons 3 and beyond completely changed gear - to reverse in my opinion. The actors were playing to the audience, talking and playing louder (not unlike a stage production which essentially it is when done live to an audience) and started becoming caricatures of themselves. The writing reflected this and the storylines werent so much about pains and joy growing up as teenagers in the 50's anymore. The first two seasons managed to fuse comedy with serious social and moral issues and not become shtick. I believe this was due to the characters were allowed to breath more and show more of themselves - talking at a reasonable level, camera angles, facial expressions, great scene music, along with intelligent delivery and storylines. The writing really become tacky after the second season. The ratings, however, just kept getting bigger from Season 3 onward and some of the quotes (Sit on it, Nerd etc) become part of pop culture.There was one scene right at the end of an episode in this first season where ARNOLD'S was bare but for two teenagers - an overweight bespectacled boy, and a plain frumpy girl. They slowly and shyly make eye contact and eventually end up lightly embracing while the jukebox is playing a slow love song. Oh so corny but oh so touchingly beautiful.

827406,A2SDM2D1X3HE7Z,B000291Q3Y,take403,"[1, 1]","It's a shame there are no extra's. One they could've added is the original pilot from Love, American Style. What they should've done (since the 1st season started in January 1974 instead of September 1973, thus having only 16 episodes) is release Seasons 1 and 2 together, like they did with Seinfeld. One thing that's great about this is that the color looks better than it did in reruns (I remember how black the original episodes looked).Richie (Ron Howard) was the original star, a nice teenage kid who's trying to grow up too fast. Potsie (Anson Williams) is his conniving best friend, similar to the friends Beaver had, but he was a little more sympathetic since he didn't get along well with his father (he'd later be known as the singer on Happy Days and one episode here, entitled Give the Band a Hand, he croons ""All Shook Up""; he'd also be more anal retentive about his teeth). Ralph Malph (Donny Most) is the lovable prankster who somehow gets the women thanks to his nice car (I don't recall him saying ""I still got it"" much in the 1st season). Fonzie (Henry Winker) was a minor character here, a cool hood who's popular with the ladies; he'd be seen a grey windbreaker rather than his trademarked leather jacket. His character was a little more defined in Fonzie Drops In. You won't hear him grunt ""Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyy"" too much here, although he did use the thumbs up signal occasionally, most memorably at the end of Richie's Cup Runneth Over with dramatic flair! Also, Marion (Marion Ross) is Richie's doting mother, Howard (Tom Bosley) is his wise, conservative (and somewhat grumpy) father, and Joanie (Erin Moran) is his kid sister (she was a little more smart allecky here, and was often seen wearing her Junior Chipmunk uniform). There were 2 actors who played Richie's older brother Chuck, a 1-dimensional character who only lasted one season and had only one thing on his mind- basketball (perhaps he had a brain tumor while a basketball bonked him on the head!). If you'll notice in the 1st epsisode, All the Way, the local hangout place is called Arthur's (it would promptly be changed to Arnold's as of the next episode, with a sign inside reading ""Notice Personell Change""). And of course, ""Rock Around the Clock"" is the original opening theme, while the better known ""Happy Days"" theme is the closing theme.Highlights of Season One include Richie's Cup Runneth Over (Richie and Potsie attend a bachelor party and have too much to drink), The Lemon (Richie and Potsie buy a car which doesn't work too well; Fonzie helps repair the car and his repayment is the hood ornament-""He took the best part of the car!""), Guess Who's Coming to Visit (Potsie stays at Richie's house and they both sneak out to go winess a drag race with the Fonz- ""You're grounded for life, son!""), The Deadly Dares (Richie and Potsie try to join the Demons, but 1st have to perform dares, including dressing up in drag), The Skin Game (Ralph Malph tells Richie and Potsie about an exotic striptease dancer, so they get fake ID's to get in, thanks to the Fonz), Fonzie Drops In (the Fonz re-enrolls in high school and relies on others, particularly Richie, to do his shcoolwork for him), Because She's There (Richie's blind date is an amazon- ""Don't let height get in the way, son,"" Howard advises Richie, ""After all, your mother is taller than me""), In the Name of Love (a new girl at school woos Richie, Potsie and Ralph but is only interested in Richie, as a friend), The Best Man (Howard is the best man at a friend's wedding; this episode deals with racism in a sensitive way); Be the 1st on Your Block (Howard Cunnigham makes a bomb shelter to protect the family, which turns out to be a hangout place for Richie's pals ""What's d'matter? Haven't you seen a motorcycle in a bomb shelter before?!"").Although the packaging leaves a little to be desired, I'll give this 5 stars for the episodes themselves.",5,Rock Around the Clock,1215043200,"07 3, 2008",2008,3910,"['shame', 'are', 'extra', 'One', 'could', ""'ve"", 'added', 'original', 'pilot', 'Love', 'American', 'Style', 'What', 'should', ""'ve"", 'done', '1st', 'season', 'started', 'January', '1974', 'instead', 'September', '1973', 'thus', 'having', 'only', '16', 'episodes', 'release', 'Seasons', '1', '2', 'together', 'did', 'Seinfeld', 'One', 'thing', 'great', 'color', 'better', 'did', 'reruns', 'remember', 'how', 'black', 'original', 'episodes', 'looked', '.Richie', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'was', 'original', 'star', 'nice', 'teenage', 'kid', 'who', 'trying', 'grow', 'up', 'too', 'fast', 'Potsie', 'Anson', 'Williams', 'conniving', 'best', 'friend', 'similar', 'friends', 'Beaver', 'had', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'along', 'well', 'father', ""'d"", 'later', 'be', 'known', 'singer', 'Happy', 'Days', 'one', 'episode', 'here', 'entitled', 'Give', 'Band', 'Hand', 'Shook', 'Up', ""'d"", 'also', 'be', 'more', 'anal', 'retentive', 'teeth', 'Ralph', 'Malph', 'Donny', 'Most', 'lovable', 'prankster', 'who', 'somehow', 'women', 'thanks', 'nice', 'car', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'saying', 'still', 'got', 'much', '1st', 'season', 'Fonzie', 'Henry', 'Winker', 'was', 'minor', 'character', 'here', 'cool', 'hood', 'who', 'popular', 'ladies', ""'d"", 'be', 'seen', 'grey', 'windbreaker', 'rather', 'trademarked', 'leather', 'jacket', 'character', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'defined', 'Fonzie', 'Drops', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hear', 'grunt', 'Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyy', 'too', 'much', 'here', 'did', 'use', 'thumbs', 'up', 'signal', 'occasionally', 'most', 'memorably', 'end', 'Richie', 'Cup', 'Runneth', 'dramatic', 'flair', 'Also', 'Marion', 'Marion', 'Ross', 'Richie', 'doting', 'mother', 'Howard', 'Tom', 'Bosley', 'wise', 'conservative', 'somewhat', 'grumpy', 'father', 'Joanie', 'Erin', 'Moran', 'kid', 'sister', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'smart', 'allecky', 'here', 'was', 'often', 'seen', 'wearing', 'Junior', 'Chipmunk', 'uniform', 'were', '2', 'actors', 'who', 'played', 'Richie', 'older', 'brother', 'Chuck', '1-dimensional', 'character', 'who', 'only', 'lasted', 'one', 'season', 'had', 'only', 'one', 'thing', 'mind-', 'basketball', 'perhaps', 'had', 'brain', 'tumor', 'basketball', 'bonked', 'head', ""'ll"", 'notice', '1st', 'epsisode', 'Way', 'local', 'hangout', 'place', 'called', 'Arthur', 'would', 'promptly', 'be', 'changed', 'Arnold', 'next', 'episode', 'sign', 'reading', 'Notice', 'Personell', 'Change', 'course', 'Rock', 'Clock', 'original', 'opening', 'theme', 'better', 'known', 'Happy', 'Days', 'theme', 'closing', 'theme.Highlights', 'Season', 'One', 'include', 'Richie', 'Cup', 'Runneth', 'Over', 'Richie', 'Potsie', 'attend', 'bachelor', 'party', 'have', 'too', 'much', 'drink', 'Lemon', 'Richie', 'Potsie', 'buy', 'car', ""n't"", 'work', 'too', 'well', 'Fonzie', 'repair', 'car', 'repayment', 'hood', 'ornament-', 'took', 'best', 'part', 'car', 'Guess', 'Who', 'Coming', 'Visit', 'Potsie', 'Richie', 'house', 'sneak', 'out', 'go', 'winess', 'drag', 'race', 'Fonz-', ""'re"", 'grounded', 'life', 'son', 'Deadly', 'Dares', 'Richie', 'Potsie', 'try', 'join', 'Demons', '1st', 'have', 'perform', 'dares', 'including', 'dressing', 'up', 'drag', 'Skin', 'Game', 'Ralph', 'Malph', 'Richie', 'Potsie', 'exotic', 'striptease', 'dancer', 'get', 'fake', 'ID', 'get', 'thanks', 'Fonz', 'Fonzie', 'Drops', 'Fonz', 're-enrolls', 'high', 'school', 'relies', 'others', 'particularly', 'Richie', 'do', 'shcoolwork', 'Richie', 'blind', 'date', 'amazon-', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'height', 'get', 'way', 'son', 'Howard', 'Richie', 'mother', 'taller', 'Name', 'Love', 'new', 'girl', 'school', 'woos', 'Richie', 'Potsie', 'Ralph', 'only', 'interested', 'Richie', 'friend', 'Best', 'Man', 'Howard', 'best', 'man', 'friend', 'wedding', 'episode', 'racism', 'sensitive', 'way', 'Be', '1st', 'Block', 'Howard', 'Cunnigham', 'bomb', 'shelter', 'protect', 'family', 'out', 'be', 'hangout', 'place', 'Richie', 'pals', 'What', ""d'matter"", 'Have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'motorcycle', 'bomb', 'shelter', 'packaging', 'little', 'be', 'desired', ""'ll"", 'give', '5', 'stars', 'episodes']",N/A

Happy Days really struggled it's first two year and did not even finish in the top 30 of the Nielsen ratings until it's third season.  That, of course, would coincide with the show's taking advantage of the enourmous popularity of Henry Winkler as Fonzie, who would become one of the great cultural icons of the 1970's.The CAst you're familiar with is all here although Fonzie and Ralph Malph are very minor characters for the first season as the show mainly focues on Richie, Potsie, and richie's family.  Fonzie wae only a grey windbreaker due to network censors worried about having a leather-jacketed dropout as a regular character.  And of course there were the two brother Chucks who soon disappeared.The set contains all 16 episodes from season One.  Among the highlights are:""All the Way"" - Potsie sets Richie up with a girl known to have a reputation. Richie doesn't get far with her but leads Fonzie and others to believe he did.  Only Ron Howard, Marion Ross, Anson Williams and Tom Bosley are credited in the opening credits.""The Lemon"" - Tired of driving around in Howard's DeSoto, Richie and Potsie buy a car of their own. The car has several problems including an engine that won't run consistently and the notorious Nash seats. This causes problems when they try to impress two girls.""The Deadly Dares"" - Richie and Potsie, in their never-ending effort to get girls, decide that they want to join a gang called the Demons. However, in order to be accepted, they have to perform several dares.""The Skin Game"" - Potsie and Richie get fake IDs in order to go to a strip club and see Bubbles McCall.  Little do they know that Mr. Cunningham happens to be entertaining an old friend in the same club.""Give the Band a Hand"" To make some money, Richie, Potsie, Ralph, and Bag form a band. They secure a gig, but Richie and Potsie lose the money playing poker.  Howard saves the day by beating the card sharks at their own game.""The Best Man"" - Howard's old army buddy, a black man, asks Howard to be the best man at his wedding. Howard and Marion consider holding the wedding at their home when the man can't find anyone else willing to do it.""Knock Around the Block"" Richie gets on the good side of a local gang, the Dukes, when he protects the leader's sister from being picked on. However, things change when the Dukes steal Potsie's bike, and Richie tries to get it back.  Fonzie rescues the boys from getting beaten up at a pool hall.Happy Days was a classic comedy.  A show that could be enjoyed by the entire family.  While people think the jumping the shark episode was when the show began to go down hill and enter that phrase into our vernacular, the fact is that Happy Days remained a top 30 show for several more seasons.  Even after Ron Howard left the show it continued to be a fair hit for ABC for three more seasons.  The joy of this show, particularly the first couple of seasons is it's simplicity and its commitment to it's 1950's roots.  Over time it drifted further and further away from that era that buy the end of its run, it could have been a modern day sitcom.The only drawback to the DVD is absolutely no extras which is really inexcusable.

I know it's about money. That said (if I'm not mistaken), Season Three ranked much, much higher in terms of sales on Amazon's ranking system than Seasons 1 and 2. I thought for sure Season Four would come along in quick fashion. It hasn't... and no explanation, anywhere.I had the thrill of meeting Henry Winkler at a Hank Zipzer book signing in May (2008). He was as electric, and gracious, as everyone has said he is (although I think he was somewhat cautious around a delirious fan who was neither female or a kid). Whatever the case, one of his handlers (for lack of the right word) said he would not be signing Happy Days merchandise (so much for bringing my Season 1 along), and it got me wondering just what is going on behind the scenes (granted it might simply be for the reason Mr. Winkler was there for the purpose of his book). I also wonder if all of us who are die-hard fans who criticized the DVD releases for lack of obtaining music rights from original episodes, lack of any ""extras"", and occasional poor print quality have done a disservice to the whole thing. We can't have everything the way we'd like it, but if CBS/Paramount pulls the plug on this, we might never see Happy Days in a home-playable form again in our lifetimes (so, yes, I would take what I can get in this case!).After watching Season Three, I had forgotten how funny the show was at that point (and wildly electric and live). There is a palpable energy that is unmistakable. Yes, the ""film"" effect of one-camera/no-audience Seasons 1 and 2 are admirable, but Season 3 is like watching Elvis on Ed Sullivan. Pandemonium. And, Season 4 is probably the last ""laugh-out-loud-funny"" season of all eleven. Don't get me wrong: HD had many layers, but some of the later seasons are heavy on sentiment (like a video Valium pill for the mind) and high 70s TV drama (who can forget a blind Fonzie shaking his fists at God while crying in a Brando-esque way, ""How could you do this to ME? I thought I was your favorite person.""). But, even as a little kid I remember thinking, ""HD that opens with Ron Howard's Richie in his blue high school letter jacket meant ""funny""; HD that opens with Ron Howard's red college jacket meant, well, cleaner and often more schlocky fun."" Season 4 is that classic ""high school senior"" season. No Fonzie black t-shirts here. Just edgy, often risque humor.This was the height of Fonzie Mania before they felt the weight of little kids. Before episodes were built around Fonzie saying smoking wasn't cool, and eyeglasses were. Before the great Garry Marshall went all P.T. Barnum (""see the Amazing Fonzie Battle with the Woman of Catmandu!). ... Hey, it was the 70s. Everyone gets a free pass there.I'm just pleading with Paramount (hell, anyone): tell us why the hold up? I'll buy five Season Tens (arguably the only really questionable season, whereas the final Season Eleven was brilliant, I think) if we can just get to the classic Season Four! Let's put it this way: Happy Days Season Four was the #1 show of ALL of American television in that 1976-1977 season (yes, above everything; MASH, All in the Family, you name it). And for great reason!An answer, please. Somebody. Anybody! I'll be the guy trying to burn his 1984 Happy Days finale (""Passages"") to DVD in the hope the tape doesn't unravel after 24 years if you're looking for me.Please keep it going CBS/Paramount and TV gods that be...Todd[...]",5,"Please Come Forth, Fourth Season!",1216425600,"07 19, 2008",2008,3531,"['Being', 'naive', '8-year', 'old', 'late-30s', 'body', 'tend', 'forget', 'business', 'aspect', 'releasing', 'Happy', 'Days', 'seasons', 'know', 'money', 'said', ""'m"", 'not', 'mistaken', 'Season', 'Three', 'ranked', 'much', 'much', 'higher', 'terms', 'sales', 'Amazon', 'ranking', 'system', 'Seasons', '1', '2', 'thought', 'sure', 'Season', 'Four', 'would', 'come', 'along', 'quick', 'fashion', ""n't"", 'explanation', 'anywhere.I', 'had', 'thrill', 'meeting', 'Henry', 'Winkler', 'Hank', 'Zipzer', 'book', 'signing', 'May', '2008', 'was', 'electric', 'gracious', 'everyone', 'said', 'think', 'was', 'somewhat', 'cautious', 'delirious', 'fan', 'who', 'was', 'female', 'kid', 'case', 'one', 'handlers', 'lack', 'right', 'word', 'said', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'signing', 'Happy', 'Days', 'merchandise', 'so', 'much', 'bringing', 'Season', '1', 'got', 'wondering', 'just', 'what', 'going', 'scenes', 'granted', 'might', 'simply', 'be', 'reason', 'Mr.', 'Winkler', 'was', 'purpose', 'book', 'also', 'wonder', 'who', 'are', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'who', 'criticized', 'DVD', 'releases', 'lack', 'obtaining', 'music', 'rights', 'original', 'episodes', 'lack', 'extras', 'occasional', 'poor', 'print', 'quality', 'have', 'done', 'disservice', 'whole', 'thing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'everything', 'way', ""'d"", 'like', 'CBS/Paramount', 'plug', 'might', 'never', 'see', 'Happy', 'Days', 'home-playable', 'form', 'again', 'lifetimes', 'so', 'yes', 'would', 'take', 'what', 'can', 'get', 'case', '.After', 'watching', 'Season', 'Three', 'had', 'forgotten', 'how', 'funny', 'show', 'was', 'point', 'wildly', 'electric', 'live', 'palpable', 'energy', 'unmistakable', 'Yes', 'film', 'effect', 'one-camera/no-audience', 'Seasons', '1', '2', 'are', 'admirable', 'Season', '3', 'watching', 'Elvis', 'Ed', 'Sullivan', 'Pandemonium', 'Season', '4', 'probably', 'last', 'laugh-out-loud-funny', 'season', 'eleven', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'HD', 'had', 'many', 'layers', 'later', 'seasons', 'are', 'heavy', 'sentiment', 'video', 'Valium', 'pill', 'mind', 'high', '70s', 'TV', 'drama', 'who', 'can', 'forget', 'blind', 'Fonzie', 'shaking', 'fists', 'God', 'crying', 'Brando-esque', 'way', 'How', 'could', 'do', 'ME', 'thought', 'was', 'favorite', 'person.', 'even', 'little', 'kid', 'remember', 'thinking', 'HD', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'Richie', 'blue', 'high', 'school', 'letter', 'jacket', 'meant', 'funny', 'HD', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'red', 'college', 'jacket', 'meant', 'well', 'cleaner', 'often', 'more', 'schlocky', 'fun', 'Season', '4', 'classic', 'high', 'school', 'senior', 'season', 'Fonzie', 'black', 't-shirts', 'here', 'Just', 'edgy', 'often', 'humor.This', 'was', 'height', 'Fonzie', 'Mania', 'felt', 'weight', 'little', 'kids', 'episodes', 'were', 'built', 'Fonzie', 'saying', 'smoking', 'was', ""n't"", 'cool', 'eyeglasses', 'were', 'great', 'Garry', 'Marshall', 'went', 'P.T', 'Barnum', 'see', 'Amazing', 'Fonzie', 'Battle', 'Woman', 'Catmandu', 'Hey', 'was', '70s', 'Everyone', 'free', 'pass', 'there.I', ""'m"", 'just', 'pleading', 'Paramount', 'hell', 'anyone', 'tell', 'why', 'hold', 'up', ""'ll"", 'buy', 'five', 'Season', 'Tens', 'arguably', 'only', 'really', 'questionable', 'season', 'final', 'Season', 'Eleven', 'was', 'brilliant', 'think', 'can', 'just', 'get', 'classic', 'Season', 'Four', 'Let', 'put', 'way', 'Happy', 'Days', 'Season', 'Four', 'was', '1', 'show', 'ALL', 'American', 'television', '1976-1977', 'season', 'yes', 'everything', 'MASH', 'All', 'Family', 'name', 'great', 'reason', 'answer', 'please', 'Somebody', 'Anybody', ""'ll"", 'be', 'guy', 'trying', 'burn', '1984', 'Happy', 'Days', 'finale', 'Passages', 'DVD', 'hope', 'tape', ""n't"", 'unravel', '24', 'years', ""'re"", 'looking', 'me.Please', 'keep', 'going', 'CBS/Paramount', 'TV', 'gods', 'be', 'Todd', '[', ']']",N/A

827414,A295P2KZIWUAWI,B000291Q3Y,"W. Langan ""take403""","[3, 3]","It's a shame there are no extra's.  One they could've added is the original pilot from Love, American Style.  What they should've done (since the 1st season started in January 1974 instead of September 1973, thus having only 16 episodes) is release Seasons 1 and 2 together, like they did with Seinfeld.  One thing that's great about this is that the color looks better than it did in reruns (I remember how black the original episodes looked).Richie (Ron Howard) was the original star, a nice teenage kid who's trying to grow up too fast.  Potsie (Anson Williams) is his conniving best friend, similar to the friends Beaver had, but he was a little more sympathetic since he didn't get along well with his father (he'd later be known as the singer on Happy Days and one episode here, entitled Give the Band a Hand, he croons ""All Shook Up""; he'd also be more anal retentive about his teeth).  Ralph Malph (Donny Most) is the lovable prankster who somehow gets the women thanks to his nice car (I don't recall him saying ""I still got it"" much in the 1st season).  Fonzie (Henry Winker) was a minor character here, a cool hood who's popular with the ladies; he'd be seen a grey windbreaker rather than his trademarked leather jacket.  His character was a little more defined in Fonzie Drops In.  You won't hear him grunt ""Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyy"" too much here, although he did use the thumbs up signal occasionally, most memorably at the end of Richie's Cup Runneth Over with dramatic flair!  Also, Marion (Marion Ross) is Richie's doting mother, Howard (Tom Bosley) is his wise, conservative (and somewhat grumpy) father, and Joanie (Erin Moran) is his kid sister (she was a little more smart allecky here, and was often seen wearing her Junior Chipmunk uniform).  There were 2 actors who played Richie's older brother Chuck, a 1-dimensional character who only lasted one season and had only one thing on his mind- basketball (perhaps he had a brain tumor while a basketball bonked him on the head!).  If you'll notice in the 1st epsisode, All the Way, the local hangout place is called Arthur's (it would promptly be changed to Arnold's as of the next episode, with a sign inside reading ""Notice Personell Change"").  And of course, ""Rock Around the Clock"" is the original opening theme, while the better known ""Happy Days"" theme is the closing theme.Highlights of Season One include Richie's Cup Runneth Over (Richie and Potsie attend a bachelor party and have too much to drink), The Lemon (Richie and Potsie buy a car which doesn't work too well; Fonzie helps repair the car and his repayment is the hood ornament-""He took the best part of the car!""), Guess Who's Coming to Visit (Potsie stays at Richie's house and they both sneak out to go winess a drag race with the Fonz- ""You're grounded for life, son!""), The Deadly Dares (Richie and Potsie try to join the Demons, but 1st have to perform dares, including dressing up in drag), The Skin Game (Ralph Malph tells Richie and Potsie about an exotic striptease dancer, so they get fake ID's to get in, thanks to the Fonz), Fonzie Drops In (the Fonz re-enrolls in high school and relies on others, particularly Richie, to do his shcoolwork for him), Because She's There (Richie's blind date is an amazon- ""Don't let height get in the way, son,"" Howard advises Richie, ""After all, your mother is taller than me""), In the Name of Love (a new girl at school woos Richie, Potsie and Ralph but is only interested in Richie, as a friend), The Best Man (Howard is the best man at a friend's wedding; this episode deals with racism in a sensitive way); Be the 1st on Your Block (Howard Cunnigham makes a bomb shelter to protect the family, which turns out to be a hangout place for Richie's pals ""What's d'matter?  Haven't you seen a motorcycle in a bomb shelter before?!"").Although the packaging leaves a little to be desired, I'll give this 5 stars for the episodes themselves.",5,Rock Around the Clock,1112486400,"04 3, 2005",2005,3923,"['shame', 'are', 'extra', 'One', 'could', ""'ve"", 'added', 'original', 'pilot', 'Love', 'American', 'Style', 'What', 'should', ""'ve"", 'done', '1st', 'season', 'started', 'January', '1974', 'instead', 'September', '1973', 'thus', 'having', 'only', '16', 'episodes', 'release', 'Seasons', '1', '2', 'together', 'did', 'Seinfeld', 'One', 'thing', 'great', 'color', 'better', 'did', 'reruns', 'remember', 'how', 'black', 'original', 'episodes', 'looked', '.Richie', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'was', 'original', 'star', 'nice', 'teenage', 'kid', 'who', 'trying', 'grow', 'up', 'too', 'fast', 'Potsie', 'Anson', 'Williams', 'conniving', 'best', 'friend', 'similar', 'friends', 'Beaver', 'had', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'along', 'well', 'father', ""'d"", 'later', 'be', 'known', 'singer', 'Happy', 'Days', 'one', 'episode', 'here', 'entitled', 'Give', 'Band', 'Hand', 'Shook', 'Up', ""'d"", 'also', 'be', 'more', 'anal', 'retentive', 'teeth', 'Ralph', 'Malph', 'Donny', 'Most', 'lovable', 'prankster', 'who', 'somehow', 'women', 'thanks', 'nice', 'car', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'saying', 'still', 'got', 'much', '1st', 'season', 'Fonzie', 'Henry', 'Winker', 'was', 'minor', 'character', 'here', 'cool', 'hood', 'who', 'popular', 'ladies', ""'d"", 'be', 'seen', 'grey', 'windbreaker', 'rather', 'trademarked', 'leather', 'jacket', 'character', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'defined', 'Fonzie', 'Drops', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hear', 'grunt', 'Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyy', 'too', 'much', 'here', 'did', 'use', 'thumbs', 'up', 'signal', 'occasionally', 'most', 'memorably', 'end', 'Richie', 'Cup', 'Runneth', 'dramatic', 'flair', 'Also', 'Marion', 'Marion', 'Ross', 'Richie', 'doting', 'mother', 'Howard', 'Tom', 'Bosley', 'wise', 'conservative', 'somewhat', 'grumpy', 'father', 'Joanie', 'Erin', 'Moran', 'kid', 'sister', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'smart', 'allecky', 'here', 'was', 'often', 'seen', 'wearing', 'Junior', 'Chipmunk', 'uniform', 'were', '2', 'actors', 'who', 'played', 'Richie', 'older', 'brother', 'Chuck', '1-dimensional', 'character', 'who', 'only', 'lasted', 'one', 'season', 'had', 'only', 'one', 'thing', 'mind-', 'basketball', 'perhaps', 'had', 'brain', 'tumor', 'basketball', 'bonked', 'head', ""'ll"", 'notice', '1st', 'epsisode', 'Way', 'local', 'hangout', 'place', 'called', 'Arthur', 'would', 'promptly', 'be', 'changed', 'Arnold', 'next', 'episode', 'sign', 'reading', 'Notice', 'Personell', 'Change', 'course', 'Rock', 'Clock', 'original', 'opening', 'theme', 'better', 'known', 'Happy', 'Days', 'theme', 'closing', 'theme.Highlights', 'Season', 'One', 'include', 'Richie', 'Cup', 'Runneth', 'Over', 'Richie', 'Potsie', 'attend', 'bachelor', 'party', 'have', 'too', 'much', 'drink', 'Lemon', 'Richie', 'Potsie', 'buy', 'car', ""n't"", 'work', 'too', 'well', 'Fonzie', 'repair', 'car', 'repayment', 'hood', 'ornament-', 'took', 'best', 'part', 'car', 'Guess', 'Who', 'Coming', 'Visit', 'Potsie', 'Richie', 'house', 'sneak', 'out', 'go', 'winess', 'drag', 'race', 'Fonz-', ""'re"", 'grounded', 'life', 'son', 'Deadly', 'Dares', 'Richie', 'Potsie', 'try', 'join', 'Demons', '1st', 'have', 'perform', 'dares', 'including', 'dressing', 'up', 'drag', 'Skin', 'Game', 'Ralph', 'Malph', 'Richie', 'Potsie', 'exotic', 'striptease', 'dancer', 'get', 'fake', 'ID', 'get', 'thanks', 'Fonz', 'Fonzie', 'Drops', 'Fonz', 're-enrolls', 'high', 'school', 'relies', 'others', 'particularly', 'Richie', 'do', 'shcoolwork', 'Richie', 'blind', 'date', 'amazon-', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'height', 'get', 'way', 'son', 'Howard', 'Richie', 'mother', 'taller', 'Name', 'Love', 'new', 'girl', 'school', 'woos', 'Richie', 'Potsie', 'Ralph', 'only', 'interested', 'Richie', 'friend', 'Best', 'Man', 'Howard', 'best', 'man', 'friend', 'wedding', 'episode', 'racism', 'sensitive', 'way', 'Be', '1st', 'Block', 'Howard', 'Cunnigham', 'bomb', 'shelter', 'protect', 'family', 'out', 'be', 'hangout', 'place', 'Richie', 'pals', 'What', ""d'matter"", 'Have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'motorcycle', 'bomb', 'shelter', 'packaging', 'little', 'be', 'desired', ""'ll"", 'give', '5', 'stars', 'episodes']",N/A
