This is a really well made and well acted movie. It isn't the most original movie, but it had so many twist and more tension than I've seen in a while. Marc Blucas' character is an arrogant wealthy literary agent who moved into an expensive penthouse. That's when several strange things begin to happen that throw him into a whirl wind of fear and confusion. As I said before, the tension was unreal at times, to the extent that friends watching it with me, all jumped few times! There are only a brief few moments that seemed to drag, but other than that, I found the movie to be very entertaining. B",4,WOW!!

1104199,A387BD735MI50R,B000VUFJ00,R. Schultz,"[2, 3]","""The Killing Floor"" does have a lot of the standard distractions/detractions of many modern films - such as an array of pointlessly antagonistic, cursing characters - a needy, steamy upstairs neighbor - and a complicated loft setting with something of the multilevel, industrial look of ""Boston Legal."" Nevertheless, it almost ends up being a classical Agatha Christie-style who-done-it at heart.You might suspect a ""Mousetrap"" sort of twist at one minute. But no, wait - there are other suspect possibilities who qualify simply because they are the last people you'd ordinarily suspect. The only thing this plot lacks to be fully neo-Christie is a butler.The acting tends to be a bit amateurish and the film in general has somewhat cheesy production values.

1104200,A2ZGHESQDCI77M,B000VUFJ00,"Shiloh True ""Rabid Reader""","[2, 3]","Marc Blucas does a good job portraying David Lamont---a very successful literary agent.  David is a guy who has reached extraordinary success and it HAS gone to his head.  He comes across pompous and intolerant of others, even betraying his own brother. He moves into a 11,000 sq. ft., three level, New York apartment (cha-ching).  Why?  To quote him, ""Because I CAN!""  The way he treats clients/staff, you know he's the kind of boss that would have workers poking tiny pins in a voodoo doll, during their lunch breaks.His bad karma begins to catch up with him. Doesn't it always! Someone is stalking!  The stalking escalates into some bloody messes.  But, who and why?  As he becomes more and more obsessed, his narcissistic personality begins to take a hit.  He starts to lose his grip. After all, who would dare harass him.  They will have to pay for upsetting HIS apple-cart!  Just what will he be willing to do to preserve his extravagant sanctuary and his life?  WELL, when you take a trip to the farm, you'll find out. Ewwwww!This was a low budget flick, absent of bells and whistles.  With that in mind, I think they did a good job.  However, the acting was below par, for all but Marc Blucas, and it was hard for him to try to carry the film by himself.  He deserves credit for the effort. In spite of the flaws, I found that the storyline held my attention throughout and the many plot twists kept me on my toes.  There were times that it was downright creepy, too, with a bit of a horror film, aspect.  Truth be told, I did not figure out the mystery ending, until we were upon it, either. I was convinced it was going in another direction.So, if you're the type to enjoy a good little (suspense/horror/mystery),B-movie, this is a worthwhile 98 minute distraction.  You might want to rent it first before adding it to your collection, though. I really enjoyed it, but seeing it once was enough for me.",4,"Low budget, but high on suspense.",1216425600,"07 19, 2008",2008,1912,"['Marc', 'Blucas', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'David', 'Lamont', '-a', 'very', 'successful', 'literary', 'agent', 'David', 'guy', 'who', 'reached', 'extraordinary', 'success', 'HAS', 'gone', 'head', 'pompous', 'intolerant', 'others', 'even', 'betraying', 'own', 'brother', '11,000', 'sq', 'ft.', 'three', 'level', 'New', 'York', 'apartment', 'cha-ching', 'Why', 'quote', 'CAN', 'way', 'clients/staff', 'know', 'kind', 'boss', 'would', 'have', 'workers', 'poking', 'tiny', 'pins', 'voodoo', 'doll', 'lunch', 'bad', 'karma', 'catch', 'up', ""n't"", 'always', 'Someone', 'stalking', 'stalking', 'escalates', 'bloody', 'messes', 'who', 'why', 'more', 'more', 'obsessed', 'narcissistic', 'personality', 'take', 'hit', 'lose', 'grip', 'who', 'would', 'dare', 'harass', 'will', 'have', 'pay', 'upsetting', 'HIS', 'apple-cart', 'Just', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'willing', 'do', 'preserve', 'extravagant', 'sanctuary', 'life', 'WELL', 'when', 'take', 'trip', 'farm', ""'ll"", 'find', 'out', 'Ewwwww', 'was', 'low', 'budget', 'flick', 'absent', 'bells', 'whistles', 'mind', 'think', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'However', 'acting', 'was', 'par', 'Marc', 'Blucas', 'was', 'hard', 'try', 'carry', 'film', 'credit', 'effort', 'spite', 'flaws', 'found', 'storyline', 'held', 'attention', 'many', 'plot', 'twists', 'kept', 'toes', 'were', 'times', 'was', 'downright', 'creepy', 'too', 'bit', 'horror', 'film', 'aspect', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'did', 'not', 'figure', 'out', 'mystery', 'ending', 'were', 'either', 'was', 'convinced', 'was', 'going', 'direction.So', ""'re"", 'type', 'enjoy', 'good', 'little', 'suspense/horror/mystery', 'B-movie', 'worthwhile', '98', 'minute', 'distraction', 'might', 'want', 'rent', 'first', 'adding', 'collection', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'once', 'was', 'enough']",The Killing Floor
