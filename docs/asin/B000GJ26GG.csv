1005239,A22INVSTMO84KG,B000GJ26GG,C. Wood,"[1, 1]",I agree with the other 3 star review that there is not enough practice time.  I am an absolute beginner. It is a great instructional DVD and I will definitely be referring back to it when I actually understand what I'm supposed to be doing.  In each tune he runs through the beat (sorry not sure of musical terminology) around 8 times and then moves onto the next level of how to play that tune.  It would've been great if I could loop each level of each tune for more practice time.,3,Not enough practice time,1375142400,"07 30, 2013",2013,483,"['agree', 'other', '3', 'star', 'review', 'not', 'enough', 'practice', 'time', 'am', 'absolute', 'beginner', 'great', 'instructional', 'DVD', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'referring', 'back', 'when', 'actually', 'understand', 'what', ""'m"", 'supposed', 'be', 'doing', 'tune', 'beat', 'sorry', 'not', 'sure', 'musical', 'terminology', '8', 'times', 'then', 'moves', 'next', 'level', 'how', 'play', 'tune', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'great', 'could', 'loop', 'level', 'tune', 'more', 'practice', 'time']","Doumbek Technique and Rhythms for Arabic Percussion, with Amir Naoum: Beginner level Doumbek instruction, Doumbek how-to, Play Doumbek for belly dance"

Amir  has a relaxed gentle and encouraging manner, clearly enjoys the doumbek and wants to share his art. There is no fluff here, just nice visual of Amir nicely dressed sitting in a studio with colorful silk drapes & and a window behind him, & he gets right down to teaching after a brief self-introduction. His explanations are clear, the notations accompany the verbal and visual instruction, and his rhythms are slow enough to follow easily before he picks up the pace. He has a nice demonstration of different types and sounds of doumbeks available--he goes over 3 clay/ceramic types & both fish skin & synthetic/plastic. There are 9 drills for finger placement & technique, as well as for the basic arabic rhythms, with demonstrations as well that you can follow along with. A side benefit is that he plays with someone who is playing a riq (arabic tamborine) alongside him, which is almost a 2 for 1 because you can see how you would accompany a doumbek with a riq for each rhythm.

1005241,A3K28Y9KMGEV7B,B000GJ26GG,R. Knapp,"[4, 4]","I have owned my doumbek about 4 months. I've worked pretty hard at it from material off the internet (which I really appreciate), from a drum circle of peers, and from group drumming at parties. I just got into a quartet: guitar, mandolin, fiddle, & doumbek. Although many of my peers have more experience than I do, there is only one whom I would consider to be a 'good' drummer. The others I am surpassing, because I understand better than they do and because I work harder than they do. The implication is: I've got to keep at it!I am also a decent amateur musician. I have an ear for sounds, timing, and style. It comes with experience.This DVD is incredible! The Master is a master! He is very personable. I felt I was in private audience. However, I can imagine some finding disappointment. Why? Because this is mostly like a single lesson, a master class. Thus my title. If you buy this DVD you are buying a lesson, a wonderful lesson. Things are taught that are easy. Things are demonstrated that are challenging. Most of all, you get to meet the Master and hear what he has to say! And because I have it on DVD, I can relive it on demand!Here's what I got from the DVD:First, the exercises. They get me warmed up; practiced in patterns I need to know; and improve my rhythm, tone, and speed.Second, the rhythms of basic reportoire and variation.Third, the clincher: I learned the weaknesses of the path I was following. I learned a 'philosophy' of doumbek. This is what is amazing for a Master to accomplish without hearing me.This DVD stresses the importance of the left hand and exercises it. It seems designed with awareness of the weaknesses of my experience. Why? My experiences were based on a fairly broad research of middle eastern drumming. I was following a common path. I was neglecting 'tek'. Sometimes I would drum left-handed, just to give the left hand something to do and give the right hand a break.'Core rhythm' is emphasized. This, I was finding on my own. However, my peers don't seem to grasp it. They seemed to be mechanical, menu-driven. Without a sense of core, you cannot improvise effectively. You have got to know where you are coming from so you can get back to it.My drumming is now better and will grow better yet. Mission accomplished!I hope all others can glean from this DVD what I have. See you in the circle!",5,Worth the lesson,1250121600,"08 13, 2009",2009,2352,"['have', 'owned', 'doumbek', '4', 'months', ""'ve"", 'worked', 'pretty', 'hard', 'material', 'internet', 'really', 'appreciate', 'drum', 'circle', 'peers', 'group', 'drumming', 'parties', 'just', 'got', 'quartet', 'guitar', 'mandolin', 'fiddle', 'doumbek', 'many', 'peers', 'have', 'more', 'experience', 'do', 'only', 'one', 'whom', 'would', 'consider', 'be', ""'good"", 'drummer', 'others', 'am', 'surpassing', 'understand', 'better', 'do', 'work', 'harder', 'do', 'implication', ""'ve"", 'got', 'keep', 'am', 'also', 'decent', 'amateur', 'musician', 'have', 'ear', 'sounds', 'timing', 'style', 'experience.This', 'DVD', 'incredible', 'Master', 'master', 'very', 'personable', 'felt', 'was', 'private', 'audience', 'However', 'can', 'imagine', 'finding', 'disappointment', 'Why', 'mostly', 'single', 'lesson', 'master', 'class', 'Thus', 'title', 'buy', 'DVD', 'are', 'buying', 'lesson', 'wonderful', 'lesson', 'Things', 'are', 'taught', 'are', 'easy', 'Things', 'are', 'demonstrated', 'are', 'challenging', 'Most', 'get', 'meet', 'Master', 'hear', 'what', 'say', 'have', 'DVD', 'can', 'relive', 'demand', 'Here', 'what', 'got', 'DVD', 'First', 'exercises', 'get', 'warmed', 'up', 'practiced', 'patterns', 'need', 'know', 'improve', 'rhythm', 'tone', 'speed.Second', 'rhythms', 'basic', 'reportoire', 'variation.Third', 'clincher', 'learned', 'weaknesses', 'path', 'was', 'following', 'learned', ""'philosophy"", 'doumbek', 'what', 'amazing', 'Master', 'accomplish', 'hearing', 'me.This', 'DVD', 'importance', 'left', 'hand', 'designed', 'awareness', 'weaknesses', 'experience', 'Why', 'experiences', 'were', 'based', 'fairly', 'broad', 'research', 'middle', 'eastern', 'drumming', 'was', 'following', 'common', 'path', 'was', 'neglecting', ""'tek"", 'would', 'drum', 'left-handed', 'just', 'give', 'left', 'hand', 'something', 'do', 'give', 'right', 'hand', 'break', 'rhythm', 'emphasized', 'was', 'finding', 'own', 'However', 'peers', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'grasp', 'seemed', 'be', 'mechanical', 'menu-driven', 'sense', 'core', 'can', 'not', 'improvise', 'effectively', 'have', 'got', 'know', 'where', 'are', 'coming', 'can', 'get', 'back', 'it.My', 'drumming', 'now', 'better', 'will', 'grow', 'better', 'yet', 'Mission', 'accomplished', 'hope', 'others', 'can', 'glean', 'DVD', 'what', 'have', 'See', 'circle']","Doumbek Technique and Rhythms for Arabic Percussion, with Amir Naoum: Beginner level Doumbek instruction, Doumbek how-to, Play Doumbek for belly dance"
