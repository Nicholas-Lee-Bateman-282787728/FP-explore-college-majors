363202,A1A4DEENGHK51T,6303212239,Alan Attebery,"[5, 7]","It took six years after the 1984 release of the original ""NeverEnding Story"" to make this sequel. And while not as good as the original, it's nowhere close to being bad either.Jonathan Brandis takes over the role of Bastian, a boy who likes to read. He frequents a kindly old bookkeeper's shop, the same bookkeeper that allowed him to take the NeverEnding Story the first time. While in the store one day, the NeverEnding Story calls out to him. Having already read it once, Bastian wants to read it again. But this book never reads the same way twice. Soon, Bastian is transported to Fantasia, where he must find and name a new threat that is destroying this beautiful world.Many of the characters from the first movie are back, including the Rock Biter, Falcor, and the Childlike Empress. Atreyu is back as well, this time played by Kenny Morrison. Unfortunately, Noah Hathaway (the original Atreyu) left shoes too big for Kenny to fill. But Jonathan Brandis is able to compensate with a charm and likableness that was missing from the first Bastian (Barret Oliver).Overall, this movie does not measure up to the original (that movie set the bar way too high for any sequel). But there is more character depth this time around, which makes us care a little more than we did the first time around.

363204,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6303212239,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","I hate it when sequels to films basically regurgitate the same storyline with different actors and expect us to accept it as `the next chapter'.  I say this as a rabid fan of the original, and so I really wanted to love this.  But, that same line of reasoning can be used for any of the countless sequels to films that needn't have sequels.  `The Skulls', `American Psycho', `Wild Things', `Cruel Intentions'...yes, they have all had sequels (direct to video I might add) that trashed up the original script (because `direct to video' usually means more nudity) and tried to cash in on something that was, for the moment, popular.  Sadly, this rip-off actually made it to theaters and has a fan base for some reason.  Sure, you may think that it tells a fuller story but that's only because it lacks any subtlety.  The film changes very few things in order to try and claim a sense of originality, but at the end of the day this is a poor man's version of the 1984 classic.  The visual effects and makeup team do their jobs right, helping to create a visual world of wonderment, and the dazzling array of colors and crispness does make a prettier picture than the darker, more solemn original; but the visual quality is suppressed by the fact that this film can't deliver anywhere else.  Jonathan Brandis may have been cute, but he couldn't capture the same depth of character that Barret Oliver found in the original film.  This is a loss, and one of those films that any enthusiast of the 1984 cult masterpiece needs to avoid at all costs.",2,The next of nothing...,1315267200,"09 6, 2011",2011,1541,"['hate', 'when', 'sequels', 'films', 'basically', 'regurgitate', 'same', 'storyline', 'different', 'actors', 'expect', 'accept', 'next', 'chapter', 'say', 'rabid', 'fan', 'original', 'so', 'really', 'wanted', 'love', 'same', 'line', 'reasoning', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'countless', 'sequels', 'films', 'need', ""n't"", 'have', 'sequels', 'Skulls', 'American', 'Psycho', 'Wild', 'Things', 'Cruel', 'Intentions', 'yes', 'have', 'had', 'sequels', 'direct', 'video', 'might', 'add', 'trashed', 'up', 'original', 'script', 'direct', 'video', 'usually', 'more', 'nudity', 'tried', 'cash', 'something', 'was', 'moment', 'popular', 'Sadly', 'rip-off', 'actually', 'made', 'theaters', 'fan', 'base', 'reason', 'Sure', 'may', 'think', 'fuller', 'story', 'only', 'subtlety', 'film', 'changes', 'very', 'few', 'things', 'order', 'try', 'claim', 'sense', 'originality', 'end', 'day', 'poor', 'man', 'version', '1984', 'classic', 'visual', 'effects', 'makeup', 'team', 'do', 'jobs', 'right', 'helping', 'create', 'visual', 'world', 'wonderment', 'dazzling', 'array', 'colors', 'crispness', 'make', 'prettier', 'picture', 'darker', 'more', 'solemn', 'original', 'visual', 'quality', 'suppressed', 'fact', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'anywhere', 'else', 'Jonathan', 'Brandis', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'cute', 'could', ""n't"", 'capture', 'same', 'depth', 'character', 'Barret', 'Oliver', 'found', 'original', 'film', 'loss', 'one', 'films', 'enthusiast', '1984', 'cult', 'masterpiece', 'avoid', 'costs']",N/A

Bastian (Jonathan Brandis) is swept back into the storybook of ""The NeverEnding Story"" and it's mythical kingdom of Fantasia.  To his horror, Bastian realises that Fantasia is slowly vanishing due to a mysterious evil force, which to defeat he must first  name.  Aided by Atreyu (Kenny Morrison), Bastian travels to the fortress of sorceress Xayide (Clarissa Burt).  Xayide uses her feminine charms to drive a wedge between Bastian and Atreyu, and hides a few more secrets in her plans to ""bring order to the chaos they call dreams and stories"".Jonathan Brandis is perfectly-cast as Bastian (this was his first big role).  Clarissa Burt is an eyeful as Xayide (American-born Burt is one of the top stars in the Italian film and TV industry).  Kenny Morrison, Martin Umbach, John Wesley Shipp and Alexandra Johnes (as the Childlike Empress) all deliver fine performances.  The music score by Robert Folk is truly beautiful (and has garnered quite a following of admirers).  Warners' DVD features a crisp anamorphic print in addition to the trailer.  Later followed by another sequel and an animated TV series.",3,don't listen to the naysayers - this sequel is quite good,1136073600,"01 1, 2006",2006,1314,"['NEVERENDING', 'STORY', 'II', 'NEXT', 'CHAPTER', 'more-than-competant', 'sequel', 'first', 'film', 'again', 'based', 'novel', 'Michael', 'Ende', 'well', 'plotted', 'storyline', 'fine', 'actors', 'bringing', 'life', 'Bastian', 'Jonathan', 'Brandis', 'swept', 'back', 'storybook', 'NeverEnding', 'Story', 'mythical', 'kingdom', 'Fantasia', 'horror', 'Bastian', 'realises', 'Fantasia', 'slowly', 'vanishing', 'due', 'mysterious', 'evil', 'force', 'defeat', 'must', 'first', 'name', 'Aided', 'Atreyu', 'Kenny', 'Morrison', 'Bastian', 'travels', 'fortress', 'sorceress', 'Xayide', 'Clarissa', 'Burt', 'Xayide', 'feminine', 'charms', 'drive', 'wedge', 'Bastian', 'Atreyu', 'few', 'more', 'secrets', 'plans', 'bring', 'order', 'chaos', 'call', 'dreams', 'stories', '.Jonathan', 'Brandis', 'perfectly-cast', 'Bastian', 'was', 'first', 'big', 'role', 'Clarissa', 'Burt', 'eyeful', 'Xayide', 'American-born', 'Burt', 'one', 'top', 'stars', 'Italian', 'film', 'TV', 'industry', 'Kenny', 'Morrison', 'Martin', 'Umbach', 'John', 'Wesley', 'Shipp', 'Alexandra', 'Johnes', 'Childlike', 'Empress', 'deliver', 'fine', 'performances', 'music', 'score', 'Robert', 'Folk', 'truly', 'beautiful', 'garnered', 'quite', 'following', 'admirers', 'Warners', 'DVD', 'crisp', 'anamorphic', 'print', 'addition', 'trailer', 'Later', 'followed', 'sequel', 'animated', 'TV', 'series']",N/A

I had no clue what The Neverending Story was, nor did I have a clue who any of the actors were. I loved this movie. Every time it was on the Disney channel, I'd park my butt in front of the tv to watch it again. 2 years later, I fell in love with the character of Lucas in SeaQuest DSV. Same actor.Yes I know I'm very off topic there. Both SeaQuest and NES2 have some things in common. You have to take them with a grain of salt. I did say i saw this one first. I went out and rented the first one. I loved that one as well. I went into both with a very open mind. Only this summer did i buy the book (which i highly recommend). In one brief summary, I knew what the book was about, and that Part one of the movie was like the first half of the book, and part 2 was the second half (remember how Bastian started out as a lil chubby kid then made a wish to be a handsome kid? there you go! part one and part two!). Something that stuck with me most in that conversation was ""Well at least the actor in Neverending Story 3 wasn't Antonio Sabato Jr.""Take my advice. WATCH THIS ONE! Watch the first one too! They're both great. And STAY AWAY from the third one. The only problem I have with this is that they waited too long for sequels. By the time they came up to the third one (1992 or 1993 or 1994) our young Jonathan Brandis was in his late teens. And the child from the first one (Barret Olivier?) was too old for the second one since they waited five years to make a sequel.Good movie though. I don't have the DVD.

When the second movie came out, I was curious, but seeing how it is involved with The Neverending Story, I gave it a try.  To be honest, the movie is actually quite good.  This time around Jonathan Brandis (Ladybugs, Seaquest DSV) puts on the shoes as our hero Bastien.  Here, Bastien must return to Fantasia to stop the evil Xayide from taking over the land.  In his return he rejoins his friends Rock Biter, Atreyu, and of course Falcor.  He even encounters new Fantasianites that either aid/delay Bastien in his journey.  The movie is full of adventure, great scenery, strong characters and even a few life-lessons.  In terms of the DVD treatment, an excellent transfer has taken place.  You are able to get the full-screen or widescreen option on a two-sided disc, along with the movie trailer, and even Bastien's Word Challenge, which is a different, but nice addition to the disc.

It had an excellent plot, fantastic visuals, and an unbelievably catchy song by Limahl. A lot of kids in this generation might not like it, but most of us adults go back to this film for our own nostalgic needs. A timeless classic, indeed. Then this sequel comes along...I don't know about some of you, but I felt like turning off ""The Next Chapter."" First of all, the original actors for Atreyu, Bastian, and the Childlike Empress are nowhere in sight. They've been replaced by three other kids that are sadly inferior. Second, the script was weaker than the original: I mean, the plot did have some interesting things going on, but the silly dialogue could've had some reworking in the process. And finally, there's Nimbly the anthropomorphic bird. The character reminded me of Jar-Jar Binks: a totally annoying character. Of course, Nimbly would attract kid viewers, but adults would sure wish this bird would go away.But it's not a complete loss. The visuals are still spectacular, and the music is almost equal to the original. It would've been nice if Falkor was given a much larger role in the film, but it's good that he's present.

363218,AAEP8YFERQ8FC,6303212239,General Breadbasket,"[2, 3]","""The NeverEnding Story II"" is the next chapter in the film adaption of Michael Ende's fantasy novel, this one more loosely related to the book than the first.Bastian (Jonathan Landis in this film) is a little bit older, and possibly a bit wiser, thanks to all the books he's been reading. Still, just like the first film, he has his fears to face. Rather than bullies, he's facing the fears inside his mind, his fear of heights on the diving board. His imagination, the one that helped rebuild Fantasia, is working against him, and when he looks down into the pool he sees roaring waterfalls and gets himself all cramped up. Bastian, in search of courage, goes to the antique store to get some books on diving. There, he spots the NeverEnding Story, now with great tracts and pages blank. Bastian takes the book once more, maybe if he reads it again he can fix what's wrong. The story takes him into Fantasia, that world of luck dragons and rockbiters, and it is once again under threat, by an Emptiness that makes all the wonderful characters and landscapes hollow and void of nourishment. Bastian has the Auryn with him, the symbol from the cover of the book, and with it he can grant wishes that could save the fantasy world. Little does he know that an evil sorcress named Xayide (the cause of the Emptiness) has a device that will steal memories from Bastian every time he makes a wish. Will Bastian be able to save Fantasia, or will the wishes make his head as hollow as the Emptiness?Though the look of the film is quite similar, (use of sets, models and matte paintings) its got a rather different feel. The casting of the characters is pretty different. Bastian's father now has hair and is a bit moodier, Bastian has gone blonde, and the Child-Like Empress has got a perm. Still, there are some characters who have been cast similar, like the child-warrior Atreyu, this time played by Kenny Morrison who I thought did a really good job here recreating the original character. It's funny though, I saw this in cinemas when I was a kid, and I didn't even pick up the casting differences! Also, this time Bastian is in the story, rather than living through Atreyu, his practically alter-ego, which changes the dynamic a bit, as does the introduction of a major villain.Though there are some fantastic places to see, there's not as much exploration of locations, and though there is a lot of dialogue, there's a little less development of character. So though I like the film, it does feel a little less in terms of entertainment and fascination. It's definitely better than the third film, though, that's for sure!It's worth checking out for fans of the first film, I think.",4,A Different Chapter,1160784000,"10 14, 2006",2006,2681,"['NeverEnding', 'Story', 'II', 'next', 'chapter', 'film', 'adaption', 'Michael', 'Ende', 'fantasy', 'novel', 'one', 'more', 'loosely', 'related', 'book', 'first.Bastian', 'Jonathan', 'Landis', 'film', 'little', 'bit', 'older', 'possibly', 'bit', 'wiser', 'thanks', 'books', 'been', 'reading', 'Still', 'just', 'first', 'film', 'fears', 'face', 'Rather', 'bullies', 'facing', 'fears', 'mind', 'fear', 'heights', 'diving', 'board', 'imagination', 'one', 'helped', 'rebuild', 'Fantasia', 'working', 'when', 'down', 'pool', 'roaring', 'waterfalls', 'cramped', 'up', 'Bastian', 'search', 'courage', 'antique', 'store', 'get', 'books', 'diving', 'spots', 'NeverEnding', 'Story', 'now', 'great', 'tracts', 'pages', 'blank', 'Bastian', 'book', 'once', 'more', 'maybe', 'again', 'can', 'fix', 'what', 'wrong', 'story', 'Fantasia', 'world', 'luck', 'dragons', 'rockbiters', 'once', 'again', 'threat', 'Emptiness', 'wonderful', 'characters', 'landscapes', 'hollow', 'void', 'nourishment', 'Bastian', 'Auryn', 'symbol', 'cover', 'book', 'can', 'grant', 'wishes', 'could', 'save', 'fantasy', 'world', 'Little', 'know', 'evil', 'sorcress', 'named', 'Xayide', 'cause', 'Emptiness', 'device', 'will', 'steal', 'memories', 'Bastian', 'time', 'wish', 'Will', 'Bastian', 'be', 'able', 'save', 'Fantasia', 'will', 'wishes', 'make', 'head', 'as', 'hollow', 'Emptiness', 'look', 'film', 'quite', 'similar', 'use', 'sets', 'models', 'matte', 'paintings', 'got', 'rather', 'different', 'feel', 'casting', 'characters', 'pretty', 'different', 'Bastian', 'father', 'now', 'hair', 'bit', 'moodier', 'Bastian', 'gone', 'blonde', 'Child-Like', 'Empress', 'got', 'perm', 'Still', 'are', 'characters', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'cast', 'similar', 'child-warrior', 'Atreyu', 'time', 'played', 'Kenny', 'Morrison', 'who', 'thought', 'did', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'here', 'recreating', 'original', 'character', 'funny', 'saw', 'cinemas', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'pick', 'up', 'casting', 'differences', 'Also', 'time', 'Bastian', 'story', 'rather', 'living', 'Atreyu', 'practically', 'alter-ego', 'dynamic', 'bit', 'introduction', 'major', 'villain.Though', 'are', 'fantastic', 'places', 'see', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'exploration', 'locations', 'lot', 'dialogue', 'little', 'less', 'development', 'character', 'like', 'film', 'feel', 'little', 'less', 'terms', 'entertainment', 'fascination', 'definitely', 'better', 'third', 'film', 'though', 'sure', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'fans', 'first', 'film', 'think']",N/A

The hero, in the real world, does not have the courage to jump into the swimming pool from the top diving board. To recapture his courage he has to go to Fantasia again. And in this Fantasia, which is menaced again by Empty, a bad fairy, let's say, he has to confront her and destroy her. But she tricks him by stealing his memories along with satisfying his wishes. Each wish is a lost memory. He is about to become totally empty and Fantasia would die by becoming a non-entity. We can note this time he is part of this adventure directly in Fantasia. But he is saved because he finds the tricky wish that kills the bad Fairy, but essentially because his father is reading the story as it is happening and he is able to believe it and to communicate with his son. The engineer the father is has learned at the end that it is not enough to see something, you need to believe that the invisible exists. But the hero finally finds the courage to dive into an abyss and also, and that is very good, the courage, and God knows a child needs a lot of courage to do that, to tell his father he loves him.

Sadly though Brandis, like most aspects of this movie, falls short.

So that is forgivable.  There's something that is not so easily forgiven though, this movie isn't even a fourth as good as the second half of the book that inspired it.  The story in the second movie has a much, much lower quality than the story in the second half of the book.  It's okay for Hollywood I guess, but man, why make a screenplay based on a book that's so inferior to the book it was based on?  My guess is to recreate so many sets would cost too much.  The Silver City and the Seeing Hand eats up a good chunk of change as it is.To enjoy this movie, you have to keep yourself open-minded enough to accept the new cast, but not so open-minded that you compare it with the book it's based on.

It does suffer from the sequel bug a bit, though, seemingly needing to dip into the character bin and fish out some names and faces that were interesting in the first, adding in faces like Rockbiter and justifying this by giving him Junior - of all things. Still, there are plenty of characters and places that are added anew to make up for these little indiscretions and I need my excursions into Fantasia to reignite my childhood visions.Our tale again follows the follies of Bastian the Everfearful as he tries to deal with the loss of his mother and his subsequent terror as he finds himself plagued by heights and can't join the swimteam (not exactly on the same level, but still hurdles for the young hero). While feeling a bit down because of interactions with a father he loves and yet feels is forgetting the mother he loves, Bastian returns to a beloved bookstore and again is called by the book. Here he finds himself confronted by a new enemy, Xayide, and something nameless that once again threatens to erase the land he loves so much. He also finds himself with a new ability to aid him on his quest as well, one that allows him to gain anything he wishes for, but at what cost does such power come?While this is indeed a child's movie, I still found it enjoyable on many levels; thoroughly enjoying the scourge of Xayside and the minions that helped promote the darkness she births.

Bastian is no longer threatened by bullies, but is instead taunted by his classmates when he joins the dive team.  His father (John Wesley Shipp) misguidedly prods Bastian into overcoming his fears.  Frustrated, Bastian returns to Mr. Koreander's bookstore and though he is warned that the story in ""The Neverending Story"" doesn't remain the same, Bastian borrows the book and ends up returning to Fantasia.  Upon entering Fantasia, Bastian finds that he has the symbol of the childlike Empress, Auryn, around his neck.  He is informed by the giant bird Nimbly (Martin Umbach) that anytime he makes a wish, the power in Auryn will make the wish come true.  However, there is a dark secret to Auryn.  To save Fantasia, Bastian must find out Auryn's secret, defeat the evil witch Xayide, and stop the Emptiness from consuming Fantasia.The original film version of THE NEVERENDING STORY was a decent adaptation of Michael Ende's novel, but unfortunately only told half the story.  THE NEVERENDING STORY II takes elements from the second-half of Ende's novel, but only uses them as plot points to tell a completely different story.I remember watching THE NEVERENDING STORY II in theatres and finding myself a bit let down.  There is a great deal of excitement to capture the imagination of children (I'll never forget the way Bastian solves his dilemma--it's a choice worthy of Solomon).  Nevertheless, the overall plot and structure of the film is much weaker.  After having first viewed the film, the most memorable thing I remember taking out of it was that Flash (John Wesley Shipp) and that cool kid actor (Jonathan Brandis) were in it.
