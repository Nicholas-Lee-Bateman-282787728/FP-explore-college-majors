1259407,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B002BDV5OE,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[3, 4]","on the front half of his show, jeffries brought something very fresh to standup.  he explored Christianity, believing in God, our need for an afterlife, and so forth with great panache and style.  I just loved this part of the show and I applaud him for it.  He moved on from there to his family, which I also really enjoyed. However, for the back half of the show he explored sex and bathroom humor, which included one long story about removing an egg from his rectum.  Sex and bathroom humor sells but I am really tired of it.  There is almost nothing new you can do here.  His trip to the porn warehouse was somewhat amusing since I didn't know there was such a place.  However, his real strength is his standup about religion and his family (mother, father, brother with its Australian accent since that is where they are all located).  If he stuck to those two, he would have an incredibly fresh and original show.  the first half of the show is five stars so it is well worth watching that.  the back half is at best three stars and for me personally, considerably less.",4,liked front half of show much more than back half,1377129600,"08 22, 2013",2013,1076,"['front', 'half', 'show', 'jeffries', 'brought', 'something', 'very', 'fresh', 'standup', 'explored', 'Christianity', 'believing', 'God', 'need', 'afterlife', 'so', 'forth', 'great', 'panache', 'style', 'just', 'loved', 'part', 'show', 'applaud', 'moved', 'family', 'also', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'However', 'back', 'half', 'show', 'explored', 'sex', 'bathroom', 'humor', 'included', 'one', 'long', 'story', 'removing', 'egg', 'rectum', 'Sex', 'bathroom', 'humor', 'am', 'really', 'tired', 'almost', 'nothing', 'new', 'can', 'do', 'here', 'trip', 'porn', 'warehouse', 'was', 'somewhat', 'amusing', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'there', 'was', 'such', 'place', 'However', 'real', 'strength', 'standup', 'religion', 'family', 'mother', 'father', 'brother', 'Australian', 'accent', 'where', 'are', 'located', 'stuck', 'two', 'would', 'have', 'incredibly', 'fresh', 'original', 'show', 'first', 'half', 'show', 'five', 'stars', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'back', 'half', 'best', 'three', 'stars', 'personally', 'considerably', 'less']",Jim Jefferies: I Swear to God

His style of humor is confrontative, ""angry man,"" and very profane. He is an Aussie, and Aussies like to swear and curse like drunken sailors. If you are sensitive to use of the f-word, this is not your kind of comedy. His subjects range from religion, gays and lesbians, ethnic groups, to his own family. But, all his stories are laced with profanities, and probably would gross out more sensitive viewers.

1259412,A111TATNFNSU3X,B002BDV5OE,Knight Poet,"[2, 83]","I had a difficult time understanding what this Australian-born buffoon was saying from the first time he opened his profanity-stained mouth. But I did understand him well enough to hear him openly profess that he is an atheist who arrogantly believes that he is right and everyone else is wrong about there being no God (despite the lingering fact that the non-existence of God has never been proven). At this point, I became very grateful that there were no English subtitles on this DVD since I had no interest in listening to anything else that this dimwitted dunderhead from down under had to say. It was not his being an atheist in and of itself that turned me off so much as his close-minded view that everyone else (like me) who does believe in God is wrong. I have learned to respect the inalienable right of others to believe or not believe in the unseen realities of the spiritual world. I have no interest in turning any hardcore atheist into a spiritual-minded God-knowing truth-seeker but neither will I tolerate listening to any material-minded God-rejecting truth-hater who might be attempting to convert me from monotheism to atheism (especially if this non-believing atheist is a so-called comedian who uses the stage to propagate his anti-God sentiments)! There is just nothing funny about atheistic propaganda. The last thing I heard him say before I merrily clicked on my remote's STOP button to silence this funny little man's pessimistic propaganda forever (at least as far as the realm of my consciousness is concerned) was something about how when we die, there is nothing that happens after that. Perhaps for the non-believing atheist, such a vapid view shall become a self-fulfilling prophecy. I'd rather spend eternity trying to unravel the perplexing mysteries of a God of Love who has invited all of His time-space kids to share an endless journey of discovery and adventure with Him as opposed to being a gutless coward who surrenders to the final sleep of death.",1,I Didn't Laugh,1331251200,"03 9, 2012",2012,1993,"['had', 'difficult', 'time', 'understanding', 'what', 'Australian-born', 'buffoon', 'was', 'saying', 'first', 'time', 'opened', 'profanity-stained', 'mouth', 'did', 'understand', 'well', 'enough', 'hear', 'openly', 'profess', 'atheist', 'who', 'arrogantly', 'right', 'everyone', 'else', 'wrong', 'being', 'God', 'lingering', 'fact', 'non-existence', 'God', 'never', 'been', 'proven', 'point', 'became', 'very', 'grateful', 'were', 'English', 'subtitles', 'DVD', 'had', 'interest', 'listening', 'anything', 'else', 'dimwitted', 'dunderhead', 'down', 'had', 'say', 'was', 'not', 'being', 'atheist', 'turned', 'off', 'so', 'much', 'close-minded', 'view', 'everyone', 'else', 'who', 'believe', 'God', 'wrong', 'have', 'learned', 'respect', 'inalienable', 'right', 'others', 'believe', 'not', 'believe', 'unseen', 'realities', 'spiritual', 'world', 'have', 'interest', 'turning', 'hardcore', 'atheist', 'spiritual-minded', 'God-knowing', 'truth-seeker', 'will', 'tolerate', 'listening', 'material-minded', 'God-rejecting', 'truth-hater', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'attempting', 'convert', 'monotheism', 'atheism', 'especially', 'non-believing', 'atheist', 'so-called', 'comedian', 'who', 'stage', 'propagate', 'anti-God', 'sentiments', 'just', 'nothing', 'funny', 'atheistic', 'propaganda', 'last', 'thing', 'heard', 'say', 'merrily', 'clicked', 'remote', 'STOP', 'button', 'silence', 'funny', 'little', 'man', 'pessimistic', 'propaganda', 'forever', 'least', 'as', 'far', 'realm', 'consciousness', 'concerned', 'was', 'something', 'how', 'when', 'die', 'nothing', 'Perhaps', 'non-believing', 'atheist', 'vapid', 'view', 'shall', 'become', 'self-fulfilling', 'prophecy', ""'d"", 'rather', 'spend', 'eternity', 'trying', 'unravel', 'perplexing', 'mysteries', 'God', 'Love', 'who', 'invited', 'time-space', 'kids', 'share', 'endless', 'journey', 'discovery', 'adventure', 'Him', 'opposed', 'being', 'gutless', 'coward', 'who', 'final', 'sleep', 'death']",Jim Jefferies: I Swear to God
