396015,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6304016859,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","Maybe the source material was never going to produce anything of value, or maybe this is all Forest Whitaker&#8217;s fault, but this movie is pretty much AWFUL.  Aside from the marvelous soundtrack (which is one of the best of the 90&#8217;s) and a pretty spectacular Angela Bassett, this film crumbles apart at pretty much every turn.  Nearly every character is despicable in one way, shape or form.  All this man hating, white people are the devil messaging is pretty dense when you consider that these women who are complaining about being mistreated and disregarded are, in effect, contributing to their own problems by sleeping around with married me and actively seeking them out in some instances.  I can&#8217;t feel bad for these women, and Whitaker&#8217;s soap opera styled direction doesn&#8217;t help.  Yes, there are some moments that feel genuine (the scene with Bassett and Wesley Snipes is one) but many of the emotional scenes feel forced (basically any scene with Lela Rochon) and the character development is very spotty, to the point where you don&#8217;t really get to know these women despite everything that is going on around them.  The narration is regrettable and sets a tone for the film which feels extremely dated by today&#8217;s standards, and the acting by most of the ensemble is mediocre at best.  Silly and preposterous and cringe worthy at many turns, &#8216;Waiting to Exhale&#8217; would get one star from me if it weren&#8217;t for Bassett and that amazing &#8216;Shoop&#8217; song.",2,Despicable people looking for love&#8230;,1391644800,"02 6, 2014",2014,1522,"['Maybe', 'source', 'material', 'was', 'never', 'going', 'produce', 'anything', 'value', 'maybe', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', '8217', 'fault', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'AWFUL', 'Aside', 'marvelous', 'soundtrack', 'one', 'best', '90', '8217', 'pretty', 'spectacular', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'film', 'apart', 'pretty', 'much', 'turn', 'Nearly', 'character', 'despicable', 'one', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'man', 'hating', 'white', 'people', 'are', 'devil', 'messaging', 'pretty', 'dense', 'when', 'consider', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'complaining', 'being', 'mistreated', 'disregarded', 'are', 'effect', 'contributing', 'own', 'problems', 'sleeping', 'around', 'married', 'actively', 'seeking', 'out', 'instances', 'can', '8217', 'feel', 'bad', 'women', 'Whitaker', '8217', 'soap', 'opera', 'styled', 'direction', 'doesn', '8217', 'help', 'Yes', 'are', 'moments', 'feel', 'genuine', 'scene', 'Bassett', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'one', 'many', 'emotional', 'scenes', 'feel', 'forced', 'basically', 'scene', 'Lela', 'Rochon', 'character', 'development', 'very', 'spotty', 'point', 'where', 'don', '8217', 'really', 'get', 'know', 'women', 'everything', 'going', 'narration', 'regrettable', 'tone', 'film', 'extremely', 'dated', 'today', '8217', 's', 'standards', 'acting', 'most', 'ensemble', 'mediocre', 'best', 'Silly', 'preposterous', 'cringe', 'worthy', 'many', 'turns', '8216', 'Waiting', 'Exhale', '8217', 'would', 'get', 'one', 'star', '8217', 't', 'Bassett', 'amazing', '8216', 'Shoop', '8217', 'song']",Waiting to Exhale VHS

Waiting To Exhale is based on McMillan's novel by the same name.This movie takes place within the course of a year - from one New Year's Eve to the next.  It's about four black women who all have relationship problems involving their black significant others, and how they pull together to provide friendship and support for each other during these relationship woes.  It would take a long time for me to describe the specifics behind their problems, but the one thing they have in common is their hatred of men, specifically black men.The movie is an ensemble performance starring Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Loretta Devine, and Lela Rochon.  While they each get equal billing, I enjoyed Bassett's performance them most.  She received an Oscar nomination for this role, and it was definitely well-earned.Though the movie was advertised as a romantic comedy, it's more a movie about friendship, and how men may come and go but your friends will always be there to catch you when you fall.

I wondered how I could relate to this film about adult, black women? I was a white teenage girl in the suburbs. Seeing Angela Bassett's character fight with her husband about his declaration of loving another woman, I did not have a clue how to relate to it. Not only had I never experienced any kind of mature, adult relationship, the racial issues that arise in their argument were completely foreign to me. The husband tells Bassett that he is in love with his secretary and is leaving Bassett for the secretary. Bassett angrily asks, ""Is she white?"" The husband asks, ""Why? Would it be better if she were black?"" Bassett retorts, ""No, but it would be better if you were."" However, when I saw it again when I got older, I found that the film was warm, funny, vengeful, true to life and universal. I guess this is the trick of making a film that features an almost all black cast. People who are not black might not see it because they feel like they are watching something outside their own experience, and yes, in many ways, like it or not, they are. However, the stories told here transgress a solely ""black"" experience and become a universally female experience. And even a human one. We all experience pain, loss, insecurity, self-doubt, and we turn to our friends to get through those times. Sometimes, as in the film, our friends lead totally different lifestyles from the ones we lead. The film actually portrays these women in a way that breaks stereotypes and focuses on how real people might deal with their real feelings.

I thought that Savannah (Whitney Houston - THE BODYGUARD), Bernadine (Angela Bassett - WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), Robin (Lela Rochon - BOOMERANG), and Gloria (Loretta Devine - THE HARD TRUTH) looked VERY beautiful in their fancy dresses. The dress that I liked the most was the one that Bernadine was wearing at the beginning of the film, which was when John (Michael Beach), her husband of 11 years, told her that he was leaving her for Kathleen (Kelly Preston), his bookkeeper. When I saw Bernadine lying awake, in her bed, crying, I thought that she looked VERY beautiful. In addition, I was deeply touched. This was because she had just been jilted by her husband. My favorite parts were when Bernadine got back at John and when she went to John's office, interrupted the meeting he was in, asked Kathleen if she could have a few words with John, slapped her, and yelled at John. Those parts REALLY made me smile and feel good. I thought that Angela Bassett's performance was just as good as it was in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT.

396038,A1X28NWPDMTDG7,6304016859,Gregg Hillier,"[1, 4]","I must admit that I liked this film a lot more than I thought I would. Though at times padded and overwrought, ""Exhale""  ends up being more than a sum of its parts thanks mostly to Loretta Devine, who is superb as a full-figured divorcee with a rebellious son and a gay ex husband. Though her performance is the most sublime of the four actresses, Ms. Devine is the most affecting, proving that less is more. Compared to the sparkling Ms. Devine,  the other Stars often struggle. Ms. Bassett, who is usually excellent, becomes a cliche as her husband leaves her for (gasp) a white woman and she is resigned to burning his wardrobe, destroying his car, and calling her rival the ""B"" word at her Ex's office. I can hear Oprah screaming ""You Go Girl!"" but more subtelty would be refreshing . On the other hand, Ms. Rachon is forgettable as she meanders through one worthless relationship to another, and spews lines like ""I can't resist a man with a bad stick."" Then there is Whitney Houston, who is simply out of her league.I know it's bad to speak ill of the dead, but lacking Ms. Devine's superior acting chops or Ms. Bassett's charisma, poor Whitney poses beautifully but moves her neck like a bobblehead and any second you expect her to cry out ""Crack is Whack!"" She behaves like a moron for most of the film (even using bad grammar as she admits to ""Axing"" God for help !) but finally has a moment of clarity and gives her creepy married lover his walking papers.  The men in the cast fare little better. Dennis Haysbert, as Whitney's boyfriend, has a Barry White voice and Tiger Woods morals. Wesley Snipes, who is determined to ""Stand by His Woman"" who is cancer-stricken, still manages a fling with Bassett's character. Only Gregory Hines, as a lonely widower, rises above the dreck.

If this movie was that great to have been a book first, and then be made into a movie, then the book must have been of some quality. Unfortunately this movie is not.I was shocked that this movie was not good; I remember they hype about it.Firstly, it is boring. It weaves in and out of the 4 ladies lives, with not much excitement in my opinion. There are no witty lines, great acting, or an interesting storyline, and that for me, makes it very boring.Secondly, I don't see what some are saying is great acting from Bassett and Devine. Personally, I found Bassett to be surprisingly very pretty (had not noticed it before), but her ""great scene"" of throwing her philandering husband's clothes out and burning it, seemed too forced. It basically was overacting without any real anger or passion. It was like she was afraid ""to go there."" She should of been screaming with authentic anger like Sharon Stone in Casino. I felt Bassett was just saying the lines, throwing clothes, and pouting her mouth, all hazily. The scene where all 4 friends are relaxing after Devine's B-day get together, and Bassett is smoking and cursing her ex under her breath and becomes angry, was much better acting. Probably because she acts it with subtlety.I agree with most that Houston is not a great actress. She seems like she's thinking about the acting, and not very natural at it. Similar to Beyonce Knowles' self conscious acting in ""Obsessed"". Although Beyonce is worst than Houston.Thirdly, the movie makes no real sense. The movie and it's characters seem confused about what it/they wants.I've looked at The New Yorker's review of this movie, which is on this page, before submitting this review, and the critic's review is similar to mine. He mentions that the director, Whitaker, seems as confused as the characters. And the only triumph of this movie is the actual soundtrack. I very much agree.To sum up the movie, you feel like you're watching a boring reality show of four women showing you bits of their lives; not a real movie. There isn't much development of the characters in it's 1 hour and 27 minutes. I think they (obviously) could not fit everything in the movie, and made the mistake of picking the non-essential scenes and all the scenes did not flow coherently. This movie is the prime example that some books should stay books.",1,"Boring, boring, and makes no sense",1309737600,"07 4, 2011",2011,2408,"['have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'watched', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'today', 'movie', 'was', 'great', 'have', 'been', 'book', 'first', 'then', 'be', 'made', 'movie', 'then', 'book', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'quality', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'was', 'shocked', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'good', 'remember', 'hype', 'it.Firstly', 'boring', '4', 'ladies', 'not', 'much', 'excitement', 'opinion', 'are', 'witty', 'lines', 'great', 'acting', 'interesting', 'storyline', 'very', 'boring.Secondly', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'are', 'saying', 'great', 'acting', 'Bassett', 'Devine', 'Personally', 'found', 'Bassett', 'be', 'surprisingly', 'very', 'pretty', 'had', 'not', 'noticed', 'great', 'scene', 'throwing', 'philandering', 'husband', 'clothes', 'out', 'burning', 'seemed', 'too', 'forced', 'basically', 'was', 'overacting', 'real', 'anger', 'passion', 'was', 'was', 'afraid', 'go', 'there', 'should', 'been', 'screaming', 'authentic', 'anger', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'Casino', 'felt', 'Bassett', 'was', 'just', 'saying', 'lines', 'throwing', 'clothes', 'pouting', 'mouth', 'hazily', 'scene', 'where', '4', 'friends', 'are', 'relaxing', 'Devine', 'B-day', 'get', 'together', 'Bassett', 'smoking', 'cursing', 'ex', 'breath', 'angry', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'acting', 'Probably', 'subtlety.I', 'agree', 'most', 'Houston', 'not', 'great', 'actress', 'thinking', 'acting', 'not', 'very', 'natural', 'Similar', 'Beyonce', 'Knowles', 'conscious', 'acting', 'Obsessed', 'Beyonce', 'worst', 'Houston.Thirdly', 'movie', 'real', 'sense', 'movie', 'characters', 'seem', 'confused', 'what', 'it/they', 'wants.I', ""'ve"", 'looked', 'New', 'Yorker', 'review', 'movie', 'page', 'submitting', 'review', 'critic', 'review', 'similar', 'mine', 'director', 'Whitaker', 'as', 'confused', 'characters', 'only', 'triumph', 'movie', 'actual', 'soundtrack', 'very', 'much', 'agree.To', 'sum', 'up', 'movie', 'feel', ""'re"", 'watching', 'boring', 'reality', 'show', 'four', 'women', 'showing', 'bits', 'lives', 'not', 'real', 'movie', ""n't"", 'much', 'development', 'characters', '1', 'hour', '27', 'minutes', 'think', 'obviously', 'could', 'not', 'fit', 'everything', 'movie', 'made', 'mistake', 'picking', 'non-essential', 'scenes', 'scenes', 'did', 'not', 'flow', 'coherently', 'movie', 'prime', 'example', 'books', 'should', 'stay', 'books']",Waiting to Exhale VHS

Each woman experiences her share of problems with the opposite sex, but through it all, they depend heavily on one another to help them through the most bleak of times.  What has proven to be the most captivating story is that of Bernie (Angela Bassett did an excellent job, as usual.)  She and her husband, John, have been married for eleven years and have two children.  In the beginning of the motion picture, though, he abruptly informs her that he is leaving her for another woman.  That information totally infuriates her and she really does some horrible things to his personal belongings.  The viewer can't help but feel sorry for her because the pain she was experiencing was written all over her face throughout the film.  Savannah (played by Whitney Houston) keeps ending up with men who use her for sex.  The man she likes the most is married.  Robin (the beautiful Lela Rochon) is extremely gullible when it comes to men.  The men she dates in this film love her and leave her, that it, until she builds up some courage to tell them how she feels.  Gloria lives with her teenaged son Tarik.  She is still attracted to his father, and when he comes to visit, she tries to be intimate with him, until he tells her that he is gay.  However, she finds love with her new next door neighbor.I love this film!  I cannot get enough of it.

WAITING TO EXHALE (WTE) does not stray from that outcome.Like STELLA GOT HER GROOVE BACK and BELOVED, WTE displays all the muscles, attire, and connections for a genre-defining romantic movie along the lines of WHEN HARRY MET SALLY or FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL or even PRETTY WOMAN, but it loses credibility not because of its cast or production, but because of its convoluted storytelling.  The best love stories possess some of the very best storytelling in movie history (GONE WITH THE WIND, TITANIC, MARTY).The story begins well, but gets bogged down when Whitney Houston's long-standing ""sometimes beau"" (the always wonderful Dennis Haysbert) pops into the picture. While in the beginning, the interlocking stories of Houston's, Bassett's, Rochon's, and Devine's characters intrigue the viewer, Houston's relationship twists/turns dominate the film's second half causing it to change its focus from multinomial to monomial.  Nothing dooms a movie away from excellence than changing foci.If you want a well-written, enduring African-American love story, try JASON'S LYRIC, THE WOOD, THE BEST MAN, BROWN SUGAR.  Try three of the greatest of the era: BOOMERANG, STRICTLY BUSINESS, and TWO CAN PLAY THAT GAME .

A thin condensed version of the novel that skims the surface of the source material and gives the viewer a general overview of the actual story. This watered down movie dilutes the richness of Terry McMillan's novel and removes all the depth and substance from the characters. The key theme of women realizing that they make their own choices regarding the men in their lives is lost in the quest to commercialize black women's pain.Angela Bassett gives a strong performance despite the weak material, however the other actors drown in this bland, homogenized movie that pushes style over subtance. A wooden Whitney Houston and a vapid Lela Rochon are horribly miscast, and Loretta Devine struggles to do her best with the weak script. The male actors with the exception of Gregory Hines, and Michael Beach cannot get past one dimension because the screenplay won't let them utilize all their acting skills. The Wesley Snipes cameo is indicative of what's wrong with this movie; it's a sellout of the original material. And that is the problem with Waiting to Exhale, a horrible script that compromises the artistic integrity of the original book. Terry McMillan and Ron Bass mistranslate a 400+ page deep novel full of three-dimensional characters, subtext and a complex plot into a shallow one-dimensional screenplay that has been sterilized for Hollywood.

Special after a heart breaking relationship. I always felt better after the movie. Waiting to Exhale really helped me move on with my life after a break up.Now I am married and my VCR no longer works. I wanted to by this movie on dvd but had a hard time finding it. I bought this dvd that also came along with the movie Soul Food from Walmart just the other day. And I am over joyed about my perches. It has been so long since I've watched Waiting to Exhale. Even thought I am married I still needed this movie to turn now and again.Waiting to Exhale is a great movie to watch. I think every girl/lady/woman should watch this movie at less once in their life time. Heart broken or not. I am so very happy for this movie.,5,Love it,1340755200,"06 27, 2012",2012,863,"['think', 'Waiting', 'Exhale', 'came', 'out', 'when', 'was', 'ending', 'middle', 'school', 'starting', 'high', 'school', 'remember', 'watching', 'VHS', 'lot', 'years', 'Special', 'heart', 'breaking', 'relationship', 'always', 'felt', 'better', 'movie', 'Waiting', 'Exhale', 'really', 'helped', 'move', 'life', 'break', 'up.Now', 'am', 'married', 'VCR', 'no', 'longer', 'wanted', 'movie', 'dvd', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'finding', 'bought', 'dvd', 'also', 'came', 'along', 'movie', 'Soul', 'Food', 'Walmart', 'just', 'other', 'day', 'am', 'joyed', 'perches', 'been', 'so', 'long', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'Waiting', 'Exhale', 'Even', 'thought', 'am', 'married', 'still', 'needed', 'movie', 'turn', 'now', 'again.Waiting', 'Exhale', 'great', 'movie', 'watch', 'think', 'girl/lady/woman', 'should', 'watch', 'movie', 'less', 'once', 'life', 'time', 'Heart', 'broken', 'not', 'am', 'so', 'very', 'happy', 'movie']",Waiting to Exhale VHS

396077,A38U2M9OAEJAXJ,6304016859,The Groove,"[19, 21]","Depending on who you are, Terry McMillan's 1992 novel ""Waiting to Exhale"" is either a blessing or a dreaded curse. McMillan's third novel about four African American women struggling to attain stability, identity, and normalcy in Phoenix was praised in some circles for giving contemporary Black women a much-needed voice. But in other circles, mostly male, ""Waiting to Exhale"" was ripped to shreds as a spiteful and ungrounded damnation of Black men as philanderers, deadbeats, and no-good-dooers. It also made McMillan the biggest literary target of criticsm since Alice Walker unleashed her novel ""the Color Purple."" But whatever your take on the book is, the film adaptation won't likely change your stance, as it stays overall faithful to the book. Director Forest Whitaker does a respectable job bringing to life these characters: Savannah (Whitney Houston) is the buppie still in search for Mr. Right; Bernadine (Angela Bassett) just got dumped by her husband of 11 years for a white woman; Robin (Lela Rochon) is the ditzy bimbo still trying to shake off her no-good ex, and Gloria (Loretta Devine) is the full-figured owner of a successful hair salon. The best performances, hands down, are Bassett and Devine, who make the best impressions, and they help keep the film moving at a good pace. The script, co-written by McMillan, is crisp with enough funny one-liners and a story compelling enough to keep the viewer interested. But there are flaws. Whitney Houston struggles in her role as Savannah; her performance is wooden and forced, and when paired against a seasoned pro like Bassett, she flat out crumbles. A more relaxed approach to the material would have helped. Also, memo to Black filmmakers: drop the swishy gay hairdresser stereotype! It's tired, done a million times before, and, frankly, is grossly out of touch with reality. That aside, it's not often that a movie successfully adapts a novel as well as this one, and ""Waiting to Exhale,"" warts and all, merits a B in my school of cinema.",4,Inhale. Exhale.

After reading the book, I couldn't wait for the movie to be filmed.I think the movie characters lacked the depth that the book characters did.  I realize that certain things have to be edited out to make this a feature length  but certain things could have  been left in.  The character of Samantha lacked the spunk that I expected.  The character of Robin, came across as very shallow (while that was the gist of her charcter, the love of her family was not mentioned).  The movied appeared to be the &quot;man bashing&quot; item the book had been dubbed.I think the performances were quite memorable, especially Angela Bassett and Loretta Devine.
