Also my mother is from fiji so it would make a great gift for her. I'm really disappointed that I didn't get a chance to watch this survivor because of work. I would be working when it was shown on tv so I missed out on probaly a great survivor season. I remember when survivor season 1 came out I was still at school at that time in my life come home and at night it would be on tv. Great times but because I work afternoon shift I miss out on pretty much everything on tv. please released this on dvd and please release the rest that haven't yet been put on dvd thank you bye...,5,Survivor Fiji,1287964800,"10 25, 2010",2010,678,"['would', 'love', 'watch', 'survivor', 'never', 'seen', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'was', 'released', 'dvd', 'Also', 'mother', 'fiji', 'would', 'make', 'great', 'gift', ""'m"", 'really', 'disappointed', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'chance', 'watch', 'survivor', 'work', 'would', 'be', 'working', 'when', 'was', 'shown', 'tv', 'missed', 'out', 'probaly', 'great', 'survivor', 'season', 'remember', 'when', 'survivor', 'season', '1', 'came', 'was', 'still', 'school', 'time', 'life', 'come', 'home', 'night', 'would', 'be', 'tv', 'Great', 'times', 'work', 'afternoon', 'shift', 'miss', 'out', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'tv', 'please', 'released', 'dvd', 'please', 'release', 'rest', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'been', 'put', 'dvd', 'thank', 'bye']",Survivor: Fiji: The Complete Season

1054131,A3LOEAFCDUA1W7,B000N6TYQC,Nate,"[2, 3]","This season starts out completely different than the producers attend because someone quits right before the show starts. So with an odd number of people they let them choose there own tribes and send 1 person to exile island. When the survivors arrive at their island they build a great shelter before dividing into tribes. When they divide into tribes only 1 tribe can live there. Basically the tribe that lives with the great shelter wins every challenge. There is a tribe switch up and it benefits Yau Man and Earl. These are the only 2 people that you root for. Yau Man is by far the better competitor and should win the game. Dreamz mom was a crackhead so that should tell you how he plays the game. Dreamz makes the most big moves in the game and screws over a bunch of people. Cassandra is one of the most worthless players ever to play the game and its amazing that she gets as far as she does. The winner is unanimous because the two other people at the end pissed everyone off or were just totally worthless.

I'd have to get that on DVD anyway for completions sake. But anyway, Fiji is considered by many to be one of the worst seasons of Survivor.Whilst I by no mean think it's up there with the greats, it certainly still has a lot of redeeming features that make it somewhat entertaining and worth a rewatch. It had a lot of big personalities who created drama and some moments of TV gold. Whilst it also had a rather predictable pre-merge and one of the worst twists ever to set of the post-merge, what happened after was an amazing end game with some quality episodes that more than make up for the few weak patches along the way.So all in all, there is still a lot here for Survivor fans to look forward to because even your lesser seasons of Survivor make for great TV.
