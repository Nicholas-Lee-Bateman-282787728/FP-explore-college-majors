529313,AK2AQIULQDFS5,B00003CXMV,Bradley Tobin,"[1, 2]","This Film is Loud, Fast, Dumb and... Fun. Without the Furious Fists of Wesley Snipes, this film would definately be stuck in Straight-to-Video Hell. Most of the problems stem from the Direction. In &quot;The Assignment&quot; Christian Duguay proved to be a very talented Director, through his use of &quot;Restraint&quot;. The &quot;Art of War&quot; doesn't seem to be seeking restraint. Instead it goes for Cheap and Fast thrills at every turn, which would have been great if Duguay had attended the &quot;Michael Bay Music Videos and Film School&quot;. The cutting is far too fast paced, sometimes so much so that you miss the explosion or the car crash, which is really a hugh problem. They spend half the budget on these action set pieces, only to cut to Wesley snipes fleeing the scene. Nit-picking aside, Michael Biehn makes the most of a side-kick role, frankly, he saves the entire film. The same can't be said for Donald Sutherland and Anne Archer, who walk through their parts, trying not to show their faces.

Action is the key to the entertainment value and there is plenty of that, mostly well done. All you need know is that Snipes is a good guy no matter how things look and so is Maury Chaykin,  playing a subordinate role with real style. The young woman interpreter with glasses is a good guy too, but everyone else is suspect: some of these others are good guys, some are bad guys and some turn out to be simply background for the action. While occasionally both those playing good and those playing bad guys are a bit too over-stereotyped in their performances, on the whole, the cast handle themselves with a fair degree of constraint, when not shooting, bombing and committing mayhem in the interest of their various causes. Key to the success of the film, of course, omitting the director, whose work is not easily segregated from what the cast is doing in character, Snipes is the key to the success of the movie. He makes the action far from boring and does well in other  aspects of the role as required.In all, a no-brainer with a sufficiently interesting plot and set of characters, to create an adequate backdrop to vigorous action.

The rest of this movie is a pile of cliches, with no purpose.  The action sequences are very mediocre, with nothing new being shown.  The dialogue in this movie is where this movie gets hurt very badly.  The plot is ok, but if the dialogue had been sharper this movie could of at least been watchable.

529321,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00003CXMV,"""flickjunkie""","[5, 6]","Most people can't differentiate between a bad film and a film they don't like.  Many people didn't like this motion picture because of its liberal subtext.  That doesn't make it a bad film.  Most don't realize that this is a Canadian production, and that probably explains the political slant.  However, as action films go, it is intelligent, high tech, stimulating, bordering on believable (seldom are action flicks actually believable), with plenty of violence.  I didn't particularly agree with its ""New World Order"" message, but it is still a solid film.The main criticism I have of the film is the editing.  In an attempt to make the story more intriguing, it is pasted together in a convoluted way that makes it very difficult to follow.  All the factions and motivations are eventually explained, but one has to pay very close attention or see the movie a few times to catch them all.  The screenplay suffers from an excess of subplots, which makes following the story that much more difficult.  The biggest sin committed by the producers and director was that they did not understanding their audience.  This film targets action lovers, who are a visceral lot.  They want to be stimulated, not confused and intrigued.  They also tend to be more conservative politically (God, Guns, Guts).  So naturally, the film bombed.Wesley Snipes delivers a strong performance in the intelligent action hero role.  Snipes seems to be locked in the action genre when he is really too bright for the roles he plays.  He should take a lesson from Samuel L. Jackson and look for scripts that are more dramatic.  Jackson still does action films (Shaft), but he picks parts portraying complex characters and scripts with strong character development, instead of straight macho testosterone parts.  Snipes would have done well in some of the roles Jackson has had.  Anne Archer does a fine job as the manipulative career diplomat, pulling everyone's strings behind the scenes.  Donald Sutherland is a bit flaccid in this film, but his character really didn't have a lot of bite.Overall, this film is a strong entry into a genre dominated by mindless body count.  I rated it an 8/10.  Those who like their action flicks to be completely believable subtract two points.  Subtract another two points for those who don't like confounding story lines.  For those who abhor screen violence, don't even bother.",4,"Good plot and acting, but confusing presentation",981763200,"02 10, 2001",2001,2391,"['Most', 'people', 'ca', ""n't"", 'differentiate', 'bad', 'film', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Many', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'motion', 'picture', 'liberal', 'subtext', ""n't"", 'make', 'bad', 'film', 'Most', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'Canadian', 'production', 'probably', 'political', 'slant', 'However', 'action', 'films', 'go', 'intelligent', 'high', 'tech', 'stimulating', 'bordering', 'believable', 'seldom', 'are', 'action', 'flicks', 'actually', 'believable', 'plenty', 'violence', 'did', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'agree', 'New', 'World', 'Order', 'message', 'still', 'solid', 'film.The', 'main', 'criticism', 'have', 'film', 'editing', 'attempt', 'make', 'story', 'more', 'intriguing', 'pasted', 'together', 'convoluted', 'way', 'very', 'difficult', 'follow', 'factions', 'motivations', 'are', 'eventually', 'explained', 'one', 'pay', 'very', 'close', 'attention', 'see', 'movie', 'few', 'times', 'catch', 'screenplay', 'suffers', 'excess', 'subplots', 'following', 'story', 'much', 'more', 'difficult', 'biggest', 'sin', 'committed', 'producers', 'director', 'was', 'did', 'not', 'understanding', 'audience', 'film', 'action', 'lovers', 'who', 'are', 'visceral', 'lot', 'want', 'be', 'stimulated', 'not', 'confused', 'intrigued', 'also', 'tend', 'be', 'more', 'conservative', 'politically', 'God', 'Guns', 'Guts', 'So', 'naturally', 'film', 'bombed.Wesley', 'Snipes', 'strong', 'performance', 'intelligent', 'action', 'hero', 'role', 'Snipes', 'be', 'locked', 'action', 'genre', 'when', 'really', 'too', 'bright', 'roles', 'should', 'take', 'lesson', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'look', 'scripts', 'are', 'more', 'dramatic', 'Jackson', 'still', 'action', 'films', 'Shaft', 'parts', 'portraying', 'complex', 'characters', 'scripts', 'strong', 'character', 'development', 'instead', 'straight', 'macho', 'testosterone', 'parts', 'Snipes', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'well', 'roles', 'Jackson', 'had', 'Anne', 'Archer', 'fine', 'job', 'manipulative', 'career', 'diplomat', 'pulling', 'everyone', 'strings', 'scenes', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'bit', 'flaccid', 'film', 'character', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'bite.Overall', 'film', 'strong', 'entry', 'genre', 'dominated', 'mindless', 'body', 'count', 'rated', '8/10', 'who', 'like', 'action', 'flicks', 'be', 'completely', 'believable', 'subtract', 'two', 'points', 'Subtract', 'two', 'points', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'confounding', 'story', 'lines', 'who', 'abhor', 'screen', 'violence', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother']",The Art of War

This is the most poorly directed movie I have ever seen. There is no point of view, there is no logic, there is no rhythm or momentum. Every cut is jarring, every angle thoughtless.I respect Wesley for taking control and producing his own films, but he's gotta do better than this.

Actors who are not so clearly bottom of the bargain barrel would help, too.But special mention has to go to Anne Archer. She's always been awful, but she reaches new lows here. The most ridiculous thing is that she's supposed to be in charge of this super high-level espionage unit, and she's about as savvy and sophisticated as an Iowa housewife who's watched one episode of Martha Stewart.

Director Christian Duguay has super charged a sometimes confusing plot with lots and lots of action, gunfire, chases, explosions, you name it - it's here.  There is very little &quot;down time&quot; in this movie.  The visuals are stunning whether at the very top of a high skyscraper, in a nightclub, or on the street great effort was spent in getting it right.  Turn off the sometimes overpowering surround sound and view it once, twice,  any number of times for the pure joy of detail, color, and the essence of mood, rain, darkness, it's all there.  So the acting at times is stretched, the plot confusing,  the visuals are worth the viewing.  Actress Marie Matiko (from The Corruptor) breaths fresh life into this film.  She is headstrong, determined, vulnerable at times, always moving staying up with the action, creating action and enhancing what is happening to her and around her.  Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa who first came on the scene in a very memorable performance in &quot;The Last Emporer&quot; performs the &quot;perfect&quot; villian, smooth, evil, premeditated, you won't forget him.

Then, just by looking at the room, he sees everything replay in his head.  In another scene, the character sees some guy coming out of a resturant.  He notices that the asian guys is carrying a back-pack.  He then drives through the resurant, grabs the back-pack, and throws it out the window where upon it explodes.

529336,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B00003CXMV,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[2, 2]","""The Art of War"" was Wesley Snipes' first film following a two-year break from Hollywood and his first starring vehicle sinceBlade. Disappointingly, it was also a movie made during the height of Hollywood's superficially glossy period and treated as such by most viewers, therein becoming one of Snipes' larger dramatic and commercial flops at the time. Nevertheless, it holds some appeal to me that mainstream critics tend to overlook, and after a steady diet of Snipes' current direct-to-video output, this looks fine by comparison. Basically, this isn't a movie for people who like Wesley forNew Jack City, but casual action-thriller aficionados ought to enjoy it with some popcorn.The story: an undercover operative (Snipes) is framed and hunted for the murder of a Chinese ambassador during the crafting of a politically powerful trade agreement between the UN and China, moving him to sift through a web of betrayal and corruption to find the real culprits.Though co-writer Wayne Beach had worked on a Wesley Snipesvehiclebefore, this film clearly thinks it's cleverer than it actually is. You can see the inevitable twists coming from a mile away, and even though it's trying to be politically relevant with a vaguely anti- right-wing slant, it ultimately feels shallow yet still over-concerned with its imagined relevance. With that said, if you can enjoy isolated moments, director Christian Duguay (Joan of Arc) manages some good scenes of pop drama with Snipes delivering a more than serviceable acting performance. Where other actors are concerned, I liked Maury Chaykin (Nero Wolfe) as Wesley's eventual ally but was disappointed that Cary Tagawa (Mortal Kombat) and James Hong (Big Trouble in Little China) are stuck with relatively small roles and aren't afforded much action.Speaking of action, the movie isn't brimming with it but what's there is generally good. What attracted me to the film more than anything was the involvement of Ron Yuan as fight choreographer (Black Dynamite), yet his services are only utilized for two scenes: the surprisingly nifty one-against-many brawl in the beginning of the movie and (SPOILER) the eventual showdown with Michael Biehn's (Aliens) character, which sounds like it should suck but is actually pretty decent. There are a couple chase scenes here and there, but these fall victim to overzealous editing: for example, in pursuing an assassin, Snipes slides down the handrails of a staircase, but all we see is him mounting the rails before we get one cutaway shot and a jump cut to him at the bottom of the stairs. Seriously, Chris Duguay - if you're going to put a stunt like that in the movie, at least actually film it, huh?The movie won more than a bit of acclaim for its art direction and cinematography (we can only assume the critics weren't counting the handrail copout), and I have to admit that the picture is a fairly aesthetic one, if you can overlook the datedness of the graphics. This won't save the movie for someone who's decided they already don't like it, so know yourself before making a purchase. If nothing else, know that only a half-decade later, Wesley would be doing junk likeThe Marksman, and this one will probably seem a lot better by comparison.",3,"""How does it feel to be a puppet without the strings?""",1345507200,"08 21, 2012",2012,3234,"['Art', 'War', 'was', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'first', 'film', 'following', 'two-year', 'break', 'Hollywood', 'first', 'starring', 'vehicle', 'sinceBlade', 'Disappointingly', 'was', 'also', 'movie', 'made', 'height', 'Hollywood', 'superficially', 'glossy', 'period', 'treated', 'such', 'most', 'viewers', 'becoming', 'one', 'Snipes', 'larger', 'dramatic', 'commercial', 'flops', 'time', 'Nevertheless', 'appeal', 'mainstream', 'critics', 'tend', 'overlook', 'steady', 'diet', 'Snipes', 'current', 'direct-to-video', 'output', 'fine', 'comparison', 'Basically', ""n't"", 'movie', 'people', 'who', 'Wesley', 'forNew', 'Jack', 'City', 'casual', 'action-thriller', 'aficionados', 'ought', 'enjoy', 'popcorn.The', 'story', 'undercover', 'operative', 'Snipes', 'framed', 'hunted', 'murder', 'Chinese', 'ambassador', 'crafting', 'politically', 'powerful', 'trade', 'agreement', 'UN', 'China', 'moving', 'sift', 'web', 'betrayal', 'corruption', 'find', 'real', 'culprits.Though', 'co-writer', 'Wayne', 'Beach', 'had', 'worked', 'Wesley', 'Snipesvehiclebefore', 'film', 'clearly', 'cleverer', 'actually', 'can', 'see', 'inevitable', 'twists', 'coming', 'mile', 'away', 'even', 'trying', 'be', 'politically', 'relevant', 'vaguely', 'anti-', 'right-wing', 'slant', 'ultimately', 'shallow', 'yet', 'still', 'over-concerned', 'imagined', 'relevance', 'said', 'can', 'enjoy', 'isolated', 'moments', 'director', 'Christian', 'Duguay', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'good', 'scenes', 'pop', 'drama', 'Snipes', 'delivering', 'more', 'serviceable', 'acting', 'performance', 'Where', 'other', 'actors', 'are', 'concerned', 'liked', 'Maury', 'Chaykin', 'Nero', 'Wolfe', 'Wesley', 'eventual', 'ally', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Cary', 'Tagawa', 'Mortal', 'Kombat', 'James', 'Hong', 'Big', 'Trouble', 'Little', 'China', 'are', 'stuck', 'relatively', 'small', 'roles', 'are', ""n't"", 'afforded', 'much', 'action.Speaking', 'action', 'movie', ""n't"", 'brimming', 'what', 'generally', 'good', 'What', 'attracted', 'film', 'more', 'anything', 'was', 'involvement', 'Ron', 'Yuan', 'fight', 'choreographer', 'Black', 'Dynamite', 'yet', 'services', 'are', 'only', 'utilized', 'two', 'scenes', 'surprisingly', 'nifty', 'one-against-many', 'brawl', 'beginning', 'movie', 'SPOILER', 'eventual', 'showdown', 'Michael', 'Biehn', 'Aliens', 'character', 'should', 'suck', 'actually', 'pretty', 'decent', 'are', 'couple', 'chase', 'scenes', 'here', 'there', 'fall', 'victim', 'overzealous', 'editing', 'example', 'pursuing', 'assassin', 'Snipes', 'down', 'handrails', 'staircase', 'see', 'mounting', 'rails', 'get', 'one', 'cutaway', 'shot', 'jump', 'cut', 'bottom', 'stairs', 'Seriously', 'Chris', 'Duguay', ""'re"", 'going', 'put', 'stunt', 'movie', 'least', 'actually', 'film', 'huh', 'movie', 'won', 'more', 'bit', 'acclaim', 'art', 'direction', 'cinematography', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'critics', 'were', ""n't"", 'counting', 'handrail', 'copout', 'have', 'admit', 'picture', 'fairly', 'aesthetic', 'one', 'can', 'overlook', 'datedness', 'graphics', 'wo', ""n't"", 'save', 'movie', 'someone', 'who', 'decided', 'already', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'so', 'know', 'making', 'purchase', 'nothing', 'else', 'know', 'only', 'half-decade', 'later', 'Wesley', 'would', 'be', 'doing', 'junk', 'likeThe', 'Marksman', 'one', 'will', 'probably', 'seem', 'lot', 'better', 'comparison']",The Art of War

Maury Chaykin played Nero Wolfe in A&E;'s adaptation of Rex Stout's THE GOLDEN SPIDERS. He was astonishingly good as the neurotic Wolfe, and made a tepid story-line a fascinating watch.In the abysmal ART OF WAR, Maury Chaykin hilariously plays a droll FBI agent, and relays the surreality of this farce of a movie by having a great time in his character. He alone is the only reason to watch this movie; his is a class act performance in relation to the rest of the poorly conceived and executed movie.THE ART OF WAR pretentiously tries to adopt some of Sun Tzu's maxims, but coming at the end of a goofy flick, one is more embarrassed by their employ than anything else. Although this movie is really about watching Wesley Snipes wander around vandalizing things and beating people up, they could at least have attempted to gin up a less shabby premise.Anyone who reads a newspaper will be totally bemused by the sorry devices parsed out as intellegient geopolitics. First of all, the United Nations does not negotiate trade treaties, does not have anything to do with the North and South Korean negotiations, and certainly does not mediate bilateral trade agreements between China and the United States. Second of all, the UN is a factionalized, marginally coherent entity that can barely keep its own paperwork in order, let alone conduct supersecret covert operations with a bunch of silly sassy spies. It'd take everyone about two seconds to find out about it, and the UN Security Council members would promptly jail any UN Secretary General that tried anything that stupid. This movie presents a total misunderstanding of what the UN does and how it is organized. Thirdly, any prominent Chinese businessman that can buy and sell hotels on a whim would hardly jeopardize his position with a bunch of small-patatoes sweat-shops and smuggling operations. Fourthly, any diabolically ""clever"" conspiracy would hardly be based on the ham-handed right-wing politics that are demonized in this movie.

If you've seen that disaster then you've seen Wesley's worst movie. A three and 1/2 star average would be more realistic. Then again I tend to forget the bandwagoneers that I'm dealing with. These are the same pseudo-intellectuals that bash Crank Yankers for not having a plot not realizing that a show consisting of muppets and crank calls is not supposed to have a plot! At any rate....Story: Neil Shaw is a special operatives agent for the U.N. His life takes a turn for the worst when he is framed for a murder of a political leader. From then on he searches for clues to who the real killer is along with a reluctant female accomplice(played by Marie Matiko).I know that the movie has flaws and I'm aware that at times the story tends to get convoluted and drags a bit but I still like this movie. I cant help what I entertained by and I was entertained with this movie. Wesley was good as Neil Shaw and so was Michael Biehn(who looks a twin brother of Joe Pantoliano) is good as an associate turned enemy as well as Anne Archer. Look, this movie was meant to be a popcorn flick and on that level it succeeds. The action scenes are stylish and well choreographed and the story has holes and tends to be confusing sometimes.

Shaw (played by Wesley Snipes) didn't exist but worked behind the scene on United Nations' behalf to influence the decision making process.  Thing started to get awry when his task as an observer to Chinese Ambassador went horribly wrong.  Instead of being a puppet master, Shaw became the puppet.  Associates that worked with him (notably Michael Biehn of Terminator, Aliens fame) were murdered.  Police &amp; FBI were on his tail as Shaw was framed (predictably).  By coincidence, he bumped into an attractive female journalist who eventually worked along his side to solve the puzzle &amp; to clear his name.  Art of War, by Sun Tzu was touched upon briefly here, asking the question who should we trust.  What annoyed me about the movie was the usage of Japanese to play Chinese characters.  For discerning viewers, the supposedly Mandarin &amp; Cantonese they spoke in the movie were hardly legible. To my pleasant surprise, the cinematography of the movie was quite innovative &amp; fast paced.  Donald Sutherland was more into a cameo appearance, Anne Archer acted as Shaw's superior, Murray Chaulkin led a solid supporting cast.

529345,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00003CXMV,Roland E. Zwick,"[4, 7]","As a piece of storytelling, `The Art of War' often borders on the incoherent - but if you stick with it to the end, you will find that most of the narrative elements do eventually fall into place and sort themselves out nicely. It's getting there that's the problem. For long stretches of the film, we really have no idea who is doing what to whom and the sad truth is we often really don't care. The question then becomes: how far can a film try a viewer's patience and, even more to the point, how long can it expect him or her to stick it out waiting for the climactic revelation? In this case, at least, the overall quality of the film may not justify all the time expended on the effort.In theme, this is definitely not a film designed to appease right wing paranoiacs. Essentially, the film hails the United Nations as a force for world peace, while it simultaneously demonizes the anti-China trade crowd in no uncertain terms. Wesley Snipes plays a hot shot undercover agent working for the U.N. who suddenly finds himself unsure of who his real enemies are when a high Chinese government official is assassinated right on the eve of the signing of a big international trade treaty with that Communist country.However, it would be foolish for anyone to take this film any more seriously that its superficial action movie format warrants. For all its high-minded attempts at contemporary political relevance, `The Art of War' is generally a typical entry in the action film genre, emerging as basically little more than a series of elaborate but often quite preposterous stunt sequences loosely held together by an over-complicated plot. From a technical standpoint, these action set pieces are efficiently executed (particularly impressive is a foot race that takes place over rooftops, through alleys and along major thoroughfares of New York City in a pouring down rainstorm). Yet, the film seems needlessly violent at times and one questions the appropriateness of using a tragedy like the mass extermination of some Asian immigrants as window dressing for what is, essentially, a routine action thriller.And routine it ultimately is. There is very little in this film that commands any genuine audience interest. Without anyone for us to really care about, we lose the motivation to try and unravel the tangled narrative skeins that the filmmakers manage to dump in our laps. Thus, for all its pretensions to social significance, `The Art of War' (despite a very good closing shot, I might add) turns out to be just another traditional shoot-em-up, just another entry in a genre that seems for some reason to be a perennial favorite with the movie going crowd these days.",2,often confusing action film,994464000,"07 7, 2001",2001,2682,"['piece', 'storytelling', 'Art', 'War', 'often', 'borders', 'incoherent', 'stick', 'end', 'will', 'find', 'most', 'narrative', 'elements', 'do', 'eventually', 'fall', 'place', 'sort', 'out', 'nicely', 'getting', 'there', 'problem', 'long', 'stretches', 'film', 'really', 'have', 'idea', 'who', 'doing', 'what', 'whom', 'sad', 'truth', 'often', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'question', 'then', 'how', 'far', 'can', 'film', 'try', 'viewer', 'patience', 'even', 'more', 'point', 'how', 'long', 'can', 'expect', 'stick', 'out', 'waiting', 'climactic', 'revelation', 'case', 'least', 'overall', 'quality', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'justify', 'time', 'expended', 'effort.In', 'theme', 'definitely', 'not', 'film', 'designed', 'appease', 'right', 'wing', 'paranoiacs', 'Essentially', 'film', 'United', 'Nations', 'force', 'world', 'peace', 'simultaneously', 'anti-China', 'trade', 'crowd', 'uncertain', 'terms', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'hot', 'shot', 'undercover', 'agent', 'working', 'U.N.', 'who', 'suddenly', 'unsure', 'who', 'real', 'enemies', 'are', 'when', 'high', 'Chinese', 'government', 'official', 'assassinated', 'right', 'eve', 'signing', 'big', 'international', 'trade', 'treaty', 'Communist', 'country.However', 'would', 'be', 'foolish', 'anyone', 'take', 'film', 'more', 'seriously', 'superficial', 'action', 'movie', 'format', 'warrants', 'high-minded', 'attempts', 'contemporary', 'political', 'relevance', 'Art', 'War', 'generally', 'typical', 'entry', 'action', 'film', 'genre', 'emerging', 'basically', 'more', 'series', 'elaborate', 'often', 'quite', 'preposterous', 'stunt', 'sequences', 'loosely', 'held', 'together', 'over-complicated', 'plot', 'technical', 'standpoint', 'action', 'set', 'pieces', 'are', 'efficiently', 'executed', 'particularly', 'impressive', 'foot', 'race', 'place', 'rooftops', 'alleys', 'major', 'thoroughfares', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'pouring', 'down', 'rainstorm', 'film', 'needlessly', 'violent', 'times', 'one', 'questions', 'appropriateness', 'using', 'tragedy', 'mass', 'extermination', 'Asian', 'immigrants', 'window', 'dressing', 'what', 'essentially', 'routine', 'action', 'thriller.And', 'routine', 'ultimately', 'very', 'little', 'film', 'genuine', 'audience', 'interest', 'anyone', 'really', 'care', 'lose', 'motivation', 'try', 'unravel', 'tangled', 'narrative', 'skeins', 'filmmakers', 'manage', 'dump', 'laps', 'Thus', 'pretensions', 'social', 'significance', 'Art', 'War', 'very', 'good', 'closing', 'shot', 'might', 'add', 'out', 'be', 'just', 'traditional', 'shoot-em-up', 'just', 'entry', 'genre', 'reason', 'be', 'perennial', 'favorite', 'movie', 'going', 'crowd', 'days']",The Art of War

Also the plot totally sucks, and is best disregarded (altho the concerns about china and so forth are interesting, the way things play out is completely hokey). All in all worth seeing, but not a must see by any means. I wouldn't pay full price, if I were you...

None of the phony James Bond, Steven Seagal, Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone...overacting or even impossible feats. The story flowed smoothly, lots of actions, but a little to much cold blooded murder by the bad guys but the characters they played were real and identifiable . You could feel the emotion Snipes was feeling about what is wrong with what he was paid to do and his job.

The most annoying part of the movie is the voice of the main Asian female character. I swear it was like a bad voice over of a Japanese film! They used every cliche in the book - double crossing partners, sympathetic but hardened NY cop, a visit to the seedy mafia underbelly, etc. Skip it.",1,Wish zero star was an option,1245715200,"06 23, 2009",2009,446,"['fast', 'forwarded', 'most', 'movie', 'get', 'confirmation', 'who', 'knew', 'were', 'bad', 'guys', 'had', 'figured', 'out', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'most', 'annoying', 'part', 'movie', 'voice', 'main', 'Asian', 'female', 'character', 'swear', 'was', 'bad', 'voice', 'Japanese', 'film', 'used', 'cliche', 'book', 'double', 'crossing', 'partners', 'sympathetic', 'hardened', 'NY', 'cop', 'visit', 'seedy', 'mafia', 'underbelly', 'etc', 'Skip']",The Art of War

In this action thriller, Snipes plays Neil Shaw, a covert operative working for the U.S. Government.  After years of service, one of his team-mates gets killed and then he is pinned for the death of a high foreign national.  Now he is on the run looking for the person who did this to him.  This is nowhere near Snipes' best.  In my opinion Jungle Fever or Boiling Point show his true acting ability.  It is overly violent, using Matrix style matial arts as one of its' the key selling points.  I figured out the so-called &quot;mystery&quot; in the first few minutes of the movie.  Even with a talent filled supporting cast; Donald Sutherland (Disclosure, Shadow Conspiracy), Anne Archer (Patriot Games), and Michael Biehn (Aliens, Terminator).  This movie couldn't be helped.
