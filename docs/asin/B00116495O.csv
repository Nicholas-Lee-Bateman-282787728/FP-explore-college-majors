I have seen similar of some of these types of miracles in person, but many I have not.  This is a great documentary to chronicle some of God's love, via miracles, on this Earth.  I highly recommend it!!!  I also hope that more films like this will be made to show the world that Jesus Christ is the true son of the living God.

1129967,A3K8POFWCQI2GS,B00116495O,Char,"[3, 3]","Darren Wilson starts off this film that he made about unusual contemporary miracles by telling how his ordinary, everyday, traditionally-Christian aunt and uncle got gold teeth through prayer--but not in their traditional setting of worship where such miracles were frowned upon.  He films their and other peoples' gold teeth gotten in prayer!  He mentions the perplexing fact that people have sometimes gotten gold teeth instead of other healings that they were praying for.Darren goes on to tell about and film manna manifesting in Bibles, and gold dust appearing upon people and preachers assembled for prayer and praise.  He shows perfectly-cut gem stones that have fallen from the sky and which jewelers say are inexplicably, too-perfectly cut,He shows persons who feel called to demonstrate God's Love through healing prayer as they go about the streets praying for those random pedestrians whom the Holy Spirit indicates, and they achieve healing results right there--even on the campus of Yale University!  Darren talks about even LITTLE CHILDREN who are moved to pray for others' healing and who achieve results.  (And he says we need to become more like little children in our faith.)Darren tells about hundreds of ""resurrections from the dead,"" and some places where such returns to life have become commonplace miracles.  He interviews a man who's been ""raised from the dead.""Two of his most deeply affecting stories are about the underground churches in China and the Gypsies in Eastern Europe.  The footage of great numbers of Chinese Christians as they meet in secret safe houses and caves is very rare (or, it was said to be when this film was made in 2007).  These scenes are very moving because of the great hunger for Jesus and the gospel that the famished people demonstrate.  Their tears and cries and their reaching out for God under the visitation of the Holy Spirit are unforgettable.  I couldn't help thinking that the situation of these people in China must reflect to a great extent a picture of the earliest Christian churches where Christians with total and all-permeating faith managed to thrive under persecution in hidden places.The moving thing about Darren's reportage on the Gypsies is that it shows how much these people who live in poverty as social outcasts have a great hunger for love and acceptance.  They responded joyously when these were given them by certain Christians who made it their mission to meet yearly with the Gypsies at a several days' long fiesta of music and love and healing prayer.There are many other good stories in the film.Darren's message is simply and clearly stated from the beginning, and it is that Christians are meant to demonstrate the miraculous POWER of Jesus that Jesus Himself demonstrated in His miraculous acts of Healing Mercy.  Darren states that believing Christians do have the Resurrection Power that Jesus had, and that Christians are not meant to eschew supernatural power in Christ.  And seemingly, contemporary believers and non-believers alike are eager for better evidence of God's Love than they usually perceive in the kind of traditional churches that apparently fear or for other reasons reject the practice of faith healing and experiences in the power of the Holy Spirit such as are reported in the New Testament.The end message of the film is that demonstrating LOVE (which seems most feelingly and convincedly received when people experience miracles, especially of HEALING) is the one, single, most important Christian calling.  And the film makes a very good case for that message.  It can be a life-changing film for believers and non-believers alike who are open-minded and open-hearted enough to receive its message.  It conveys very plausibly, but with a nice, light, relaxed touch, which seems characteristic of Darren's personality, the fact that God DOES work unusual miracles through faith.  Darren says the reason Jesus gives these miracles is because He wishes to show all people how very much He loves them.(The only very small complaint that I  would express is about a technical aspect of the film.  I felt it moved a bit slowly and sometimes dwelt too repetitiously on the same film footage, but that wasn't really much of a problem.)",5,"God's Finger points, through miracles, to Love",1322352000,"11 27, 2011",2011,4247,"['Darren', 'Wilson', 'film', 'made', 'unusual', 'contemporary', 'miracles', 'telling', 'how', 'ordinary', 'everyday', 'traditionally-Christian', 'aunt', 'uncle', 'got', 'gold', 'teeth', 'prayer', 'not', 'traditional', 'setting', 'worship', 'where', 'such', 'miracles', 'were', 'frowned', 'upon', 'films', 'other', 'peoples', 'gold', 'teeth', 'gotten', 'prayer', 'perplexing', 'fact', 'people', 'have', 'sometimes', 'gotten', 'gold', 'teeth', 'instead', 'other', 'healings', 'were', 'praying', 'for.Darren', 'tell', 'about', 'film', 'manna', 'manifesting', 'Bibles', 'gold', 'dust', 'appearing', 'people', 'preachers', 'assembled', 'prayer', 'praise', 'perfectly-cut', 'gem', 'stones', 'have', 'fallen', 'sky', 'jewelers', 'say', 'are', 'inexplicably', 'too-perfectly', 'cut', 'persons', 'who', 'feel', 'called', 'demonstrate', 'God', 'Love', 'healing', 'prayer', 'go', 'streets', 'praying', 'random', 'pedestrians', 'whom', 'Holy', 'Spirit', 'achieve', 'healing', 'results', 'right', 'even', 'campus', 'Yale', 'University', 'Darren', 'talks', 'even', 'LITTLE', 'CHILDREN', 'who', 'are', 'moved', 'pray', 'others', 'healing', 'who', 'achieve', 'results', 'need', 'become', 'more', 'like', 'little', 'children', 'faith', 'Darren', 'hundreds', 'resurrections', 'dead', 'places', 'where', 'such', 'returns', 'life', 'have', 'become', 'commonplace', 'miracles', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'raised', 'dead', 'Two', 'most', 'deeply', 'affecting', 'stories', 'are', 'underground', 'churches', 'China', 'Gypsies', 'Eastern', 'Europe', 'footage', 'great', 'numbers', 'Chinese', 'Christians', 'meet', 'secret', 'safe', 'houses', 'caves', 'very', 'rare', 'was', 'said', 'be', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'made', '2007', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'moving', 'great', 'hunger', 'Jesus', 'gospel', 'famished', 'people', 'demonstrate', 'tears', 'cries', 'reaching', 'out', 'God', 'visitation', 'Holy', 'Spirit', 'are', 'unforgettable', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'situation', 'people', 'China', 'must', 'reflect', 'great', 'extent', 'picture', 'earliest', 'Christian', 'churches', 'where', 'Christians', 'total', 'all-permeating', 'faith', 'managed', 'thrive', 'persecution', 'hidden', 'places.The', 'moving', 'thing', 'Darren', 'reportage', 'Gypsies', 'how', 'much', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'poverty', 'social', 'outcasts', 'have', 'great', 'hunger', 'love', 'acceptance', 'responded', 'joyously', 'when', 'were', 'given', 'certain', 'Christians', 'who', 'made', 'mission', 'meet', 'yearly', 'Gypsies', 'several', 'days', 'long', 'fiesta', 'music', 'love', 'healing', 'prayer.There', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'good', 'stories', 'film.Darren', 'message', 'simply', 'clearly', 'stated', 'beginning', 'Christians', 'are', 'meant', 'demonstrate', 'miraculous', 'POWER', 'Jesus', 'Jesus', 'Himself', 'demonstrated', 'miraculous', 'acts', 'Healing', 'Mercy', 'Darren', 'believing', 'Christians', 'do', 'have', 'Resurrection', 'Power', 'Jesus', 'had', 'Christians', 'are', 'not', 'meant', 'eschew', 'supernatural', 'power', 'Christ', 'seemingly', 'contemporary', 'believers', 'non-believers', 'alike', 'are', 'eager', 'better', 'evidence', 'God', 'Love', 'usually', 'perceive', 'kind', 'traditional', 'churches', 'apparently', 'fear', 'other', 'reasons', 'reject', 'practice', 'faith', 'healing', 'experiences', 'power', 'Holy', 'Spirit', 'such', 'are', 'reported', 'New', 'Testament.The', 'end', 'message', 'film', 'demonstrating', 'LOVE', 'most', 'feelingly', 'convincedly', 'received', 'when', 'people', 'experience', 'miracles', 'especially', 'HEALING', 'one', 'single', 'most', 'important', 'Christian', 'calling', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'case', 'message', 'can', 'be', 'life-changing', 'film', 'believers', 'non-believers', 'who', 'are', 'open-minded', 'open-hearted', 'enough', 'receive', 'message', 'conveys', 'very', 'plausibly', 'nice', 'light', 'relaxed', 'touch', 'characteristic', 'Darren', 'personality', 'fact', 'God', 'DOES', 'work', 'unusual', 'miracles', 'faith', 'Darren', 'reason', 'Jesus', 'miracles', 'show', 'people', 'how', 'very', 'much', 'only', 'very', 'small', 'complaint', 'would', 'express', 'technical', 'aspect', 'film', 'felt', 'moved', 'bit', 'slowly', 'sometimes', 'dwelt', 'too', 'repetitiously', 'same', 'film', 'footage', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'much', 'problem']",Finger of God
