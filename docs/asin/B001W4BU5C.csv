Women fought in WW2 or Animals played their part in WW2 etc. Then both are extremely poorly handled.The merits of this film are that there is enough going on for it to entertain (mildly) and serveral actresses are pretty to look at - Sophie Marceau is very elegant and there is detail in period settings.

A captured British geologist threatens to ruin everything and quite possibly, turn the tide of the war in the German's favor. They must retrieve him from the clutches of the Gestapo in France...and they trust 5 women and one man to the task.There's a former prostitute in prison for a killing a man. She's recruited in exchange for her life. She surprised me and quickly became a favorite. Louise...is the leader, the one who feels responsible. She's hardened, and I suppose she must be after watching her husband shot before her very eyes. There's some former dancer who romanced a Nazi officer. I didn't quite &#34;get&#34; her. Woman four is a young blonde, and the fifth is a Jewish Italian nurse who takes no nonsense.The movie is action packed and suspenseful. Shooting, torture, secrets, jumping from airplanes, escaping the Gestapo. You never know who is going to be shot next or what plans will go awry. Naturally, nothing goes according to plan, and the women are constantly fleeing for their lives or regrouping...or worse. Not everyone can withstand torture...There's nudity. Some made perfect sense, such as the dancers distracting the hospital soldiers, but some of it didn't--the weird death scene in which the girl took all her clothes off... I couldn't figure that out.As I said above, the former prisoner/woman of ill repute became a favorite of mine, though Louise and the Italian woman were very strong too. I could have done without Suzy and the blonde.I must say though, the characterizations were somewhat poorly done. My favorite woman made it clear she just wanted to take the money and run after the first task, what she'd agreed to, but then suddenly she became the most gung-go, the most determined to complete the next assignment. It was never explained, this change in her demeanor. And Suzy confused me.I have a huge quibble: The movie is French and thus has English subtitles, but when they speak English, there is nothing, no captioning for the hearing impaired, nada. Thankfully these scenes are minor and I could get the gist of what was going on, but it made me disgruntled nevertheless.The best part though is that apparently this movie was inspired by a real woman (Louise's character) named Lis&eacute; de Baissac and I feel that it made a great tribute to the women who helped Normandy come to pass and thus, won the war.",3,Suspenseful,1396224000,"03 31, 2014",2014,2431,"['1944', 'Churchill', 'SOE', 'group', 'sights', 'set', 'Normandy', 'captured', 'British', 'geologist', 'threatens', 'ruin', 'everything', 'quite', 'possibly', 'turn', 'tide', 'war', 'German', 'favor', 'must', 'retrieve', 'clutches', 'Gestapo', 'France', 'trust', '5', 'women', 'one', 'man', 'task.There', 'former', 'prostitute', 'prison', 'killing', 'man', 'recruited', 'exchange', 'life', 'surprised', 'quickly', 'became', 'favorite', 'Louise', 'leader', 'one', 'who', 'responsible', 'hardened', 'suppose', 'must', 'be', 'watching', 'husband', 'shot', 'very', 'eyes', 'former', 'dancer', 'who', 'romanced', 'Nazi', 'officer', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', '34', 'get', '34', 'Woman', 'four', 'young', 'blonde', 'fifth', 'Jewish', 'Italian', 'nurse', 'who', 'nonsense.The', 'movie', 'action', 'packed', 'suspenseful', 'Shooting', 'torture', 'secrets', 'jumping', 'airplanes', 'escaping', 'Gestapo', 'never', 'know', 'who', 'going', 'be', 'shot', 'next', 'what', 'plans', 'will', 'go', 'awry', 'Naturally', 'nothing', 'according', 'plan', 'women', 'are', 'constantly', 'fleeing', 'lives', 'regrouping', 'worse', 'Not', 'everyone', 'can', 'withstand', 'torture', 'nudity', 'made', 'perfect', 'sense', 'such', 'dancers', 'distracting', 'hospital', 'soldiers', 'did', ""n't"", 'weird', 'death', 'scene', 'girl', 'took', 'clothes', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out.As', 'said', 'former', 'prisoner/woman', 'ill', 'repute', 'became', 'favorite', 'mine', 'Louise', 'Italian', 'woman', 'were', 'very', 'strong', 'too', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'Suzy', 'blonde.I', 'must', 'say', 'characterizations', 'were', 'somewhat', 'poorly', 'done', 'favorite', 'woman', 'made', 'clear', 'just', 'wanted', 'take', 'money', 'run', 'first', 'task', 'what', ""'d"", 'agreed', 'then', 'suddenly', 'became', 'most', 'gung-go', 'most', 'determined', 'complete', 'next', 'assignment', 'was', 'never', 'explained', 'change', 'demeanor', 'Suzy', 'confused', 'me.I', 'have', 'huge', 'quibble', 'movie', 'French', 'thus', 'English', 'subtitles', 'when', 'speak', 'English', 'nothing', 'captioning', 'hearing', 'impaired', 'nada', 'Thankfully', 'scenes', 'are', 'minor', 'could', 'get', 'gist', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'made', 'disgruntled', 'nevertheless.The', 'best', 'part', 'though', 'apparently', 'movie', 'was', 'inspired', 'real', 'woman', 'Louise', 'character', 'named', 'Lis', 'eacute', 'Baissac', 'feel', 'made', 'great', 'tribute', 'women', 'who', 'helped', 'Normandy', 'come', 'pass', 'thus', 'won', 'war']",N/A

1244237,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B001W4BU5C,Trevor Willsmer,"[6, 6]","While French title Les Femmes de l'Ombre may aspire to Jean-Pierre Melville, English translation Female Agents is closer to the mark, though this surprisingly well reviewed but increasingly hokey story of a quintet of French SOE agents in occupied France might have been more accurately called Ou Babes Audace. Its group of poorly defined stereotypes led by Sophie Marceau at her most coldly unlikeable are sent to rescue a British geologist on whom the success of D-Day depends from a German army hospital in Normandy, which they manage with unlikely ease with a couple of nurses outfits, a striptease show and a lot of unlikely machinegun fire and explosions, but it turns out the gals have been misled by Marceau's estranged brother and superior in the SOE Julien Boisselier. They're also expected to assassinate a German SS officer with a severe case of vertigo (the Hitchcock kind - he's searching for a double of the French girl who jilted him at the altar and ran off to England), and wouldn't you know it, team member Marie Gillain isn't just a dead ringer for her, she actually is his ex. From then on, what had been a fairly handsomely mounted, efficient but not terribly exciting potboiler becomes an increasingly absurd mess of increasingly moronic and unconvincing contrivance and coincidence-prone hokum that loses most of its relation to reality and sheds IQ points by the reel. Naturally, the girls keep on fudging their mission for no other reason than to kill off another member of the team until it has become so nonsensical that it's threatening to outstay what little welcome it has left.There's not much room for characterisation until the last third, which is leaving it a bit late for us to care about anyone. Moreau is at her most determinedly disagreeable, something the script does at least briefly try to address by having one character note that ""Pity isn't your strong point. Try to be a little bit human for once."" Unfortunately when she does it simply shows up her limitations, putting you in mind more of Frasier Crane's ex-wife Lilith than the likes of Odette Sanson or Violette Szabo, though she has more to work with than the clich&eacute;d dilemmas facing the other characters. Will the one-time collaborator sleep with her ex or kill him? Will cynical death row whore Julie Depardieu discover idealism? Will the nice Catholic girl Deborah Francois commit suicide to avoid torture? Will a CGi-resurrected Anton Diffring and Ferdy Mayne turn up for old clich&eacute;s sake? These people simply act like they're in an old war movie rather than real people, going through scenes designed as would-be movie setpieces rather than convincing or involving drama. Small wonder that Moritz Bleibtrau's German villain is the closest the film has to a convincing character: he at least behaves as if he belongs in the time and place more often than not.There's some cynicism thrown in along the way to try to make it all seem less clich&eacute;d - it's the De Gaullist in the group who cracks instantly under the threat of torture and betrays them while a black marketeer is neatly derided: ""Start with the Germans, end the war with the Brits. How French can you get?"" But at times it feels more cynical itself, with just enough tits and Tommy guns to help sell a few more tickets - director Jean-Paul Salom&eacute; even makes sure that one girl is given a gratuitous full frontal nude suicide scene. When a final caption informing us that 'this film is dedicated to the women who fought against Nazi barbarity' comes up you almost expect the words 'and got their tits out doing it' to appear. Not too many pluses - the action scenes aren't very convincing, though a scene on the Metro almost works despite its unlikeliness - but at least Maya Sansa makes an impression in the film's most underwritten role. The 2-disc edition of the UK PAL DVD includes Deborah Francois' semi-improvised audition scene that hints at a more interesting film that could have been made if co-writer-director Salom&eacute; had been more interested in exploring the characters, but the film he ended up making is at best overlong hokum.",2,Ou Babes Audaces (Where Chicks Dare),1255219200,"10 11, 2009",2009,4141,"['French', 'title', 'Les', 'Femmes', ""l'Ombre"", 'may', 'aspire', 'Jean-Pierre', 'Melville', 'English', 'translation', 'Female', 'Agents', 'closer', 'mark', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'reviewed', 'increasingly', 'hokey', 'story', 'quintet', 'French', 'SOE', 'agents', 'occupied', 'France', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'accurately', 'called', 'Ou', 'Babes', 'Audace', 'group', 'poorly', 'defined', 'stereotypes', 'led', 'Sophie', 'Marceau', 'most', 'coldly', 'unlikeable', 'are', 'sent', 'rescue', 'British', 'geologist', 'whom', 'success', 'D-Day', 'German', 'army', 'hospital', 'Normandy', 'manage', 'unlikely', 'ease', 'couple', 'nurses', 'outfits', 'striptease', 'show', 'lot', 'unlikely', 'machinegun', 'fire', 'explosions', 'out', 'gals', 'have', 'been', 'misled', 'Marceau', 'estranged', 'brother', 'superior', 'SOE', 'Julien', 'Boisselier', ""'re"", 'also', 'expected', 'assassinate', 'German', 'SS', 'officer', 'severe', 'case', 'vertigo', 'Hitchcock', 'kind', 'searching', 'double', 'French', 'girl', 'who', 'jilted', 'altar', 'ran', 'off', 'England', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'member', 'Marie', 'Gillain', ""n't"", 'just', 'dead', 'ringer', 'actually', 'ex', 'then', 'what', 'had', 'been', 'fairly', 'handsomely', 'mounted', 'efficient', 'not', 'terribly', 'exciting', 'potboiler', 'increasingly', 'absurd', 'mess', 'increasingly', 'moronic', 'unconvincing', 'contrivance', 'coincidence-prone', 'hokum', 'most', 'relation', 'reality', 'sheds', 'IQ', 'points', 'reel', 'Naturally', 'girls', 'keep', 'fudging', 'mission', 'other', 'reason', 'kill', 'off', 'member', 'team', 'become', 'so', 'nonsensical', 'threatening', 'outstay', 'what', 'little', 'welcome', 'left.There', 'not', 'much', 'room', 'characterisation', 'last', 'third', 'leaving', 'bit', 'late', 'care', 'anyone', 'Moreau', 'most', 'determinedly', 'disagreeable', 'something', 'script', 'least', 'briefly', 'try', 'address', 'having', 'one', 'character', 'note', 'Pity', ""n't"", 'strong', 'point', 'Try', 'be', 'little', 'bit', 'human', 'once', 'Unfortunately', 'when', 'simply', 'up', 'limitations', 'putting', 'mind', 'more', 'Frasier', 'Crane', 'ex-wife', 'Lilith', 'likes', 'Odette', 'Sanson', 'Violette', 'Szabo', 'more', 'work', 'clich', 'eacute', 'dilemmas', 'facing', 'other', 'characters', 'Will', 'one-time', 'collaborator', 'sleep', 'ex', 'kill', 'Will', 'cynical', 'death', 'row', 'Julie', 'Depardieu', 'discover', 'idealism', 'Will', 'nice', 'Catholic', 'girl', 'Deborah', 'Francois', 'commit', 'suicide', 'avoid', 'torture', 'Will', 'CGi-resurrected', 'Anton', 'Diffring', 'Ferdy', 'Mayne', 'turn', 'up', 'old', 'clich', 'eacute', 'sake', 'people', 'simply', 'act', ""'re"", 'old', 'war', 'movie', 'rather', 'real', 'people', 'going', 'scenes', 'designed', 'would-be', 'movie', 'setpieces', 'rather', 'convincing', 'involving', 'drama', 'Small', 'wonder', 'Moritz', 'Bleibtrau', 'German', 'villain', 'closest', 'film', 'convincing', 'character', 'least', 'behaves', 'time', 'place', 'more', 'often', 'cynicism', 'thrown', 'way', 'try', 'make', 'seem', 'less', 'clich', 'eacute', 'De', 'Gaullist', 'group', 'who', 'instantly', 'threat', 'torture', 'black', 'marketeer', 'neatly', 'derided', 'Start', 'Germans', 'end', 'war', 'Brits', 'How', 'French', 'can', 'get', 'times', 'more', 'cynical', 'just', 'enough', 'tits', 'Tommy', 'guns', 'help', 'sell', 'few', 'more', 'tickets', 'director', 'Jean-Paul', 'Salom', 'eacute', 'even', 'sure', 'one', 'girl', 'given', 'gratuitous', 'full', 'frontal', 'nude', 'suicide', 'scene', 'When', 'final', 'caption', 'informing', 'film', 'dedicated', 'women', 'who', 'fought', 'Nazi', 'barbarity', 'up', 'almost', 'expect', 'words', ""'and"", 'got', 'tits', 'out', 'doing', 'appear', 'Not', 'too', 'many', 'pluses', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'convincing', 'scene', 'Metro', 'almost', 'unlikeliness', 'least', 'Maya', 'Sansa', 'impression', 'film', 'most', 'underwritten', 'role', '2-disc', 'edition', 'UK', 'PAL', 'DVD', 'Deborah', 'Francois', 'semi-improvised', 'audition', 'scene', 'more', 'interesting', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'co-writer-director', 'Salom', 'eacute', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'interested', 'exploring', 'characters', 'film', 'ended', 'up', 'making', 'best', 'overlong', 'hokum']",N/A
