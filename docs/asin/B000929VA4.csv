899897,A3LDRRC6MYEGJP,B000929VA4,,"[4, 7]","I had an unusual reaction to this series: I didn't exactly *like* it, but I couldn't stop watching it.From a ""mecha design"" standpoint, it's innovative. All the Mu mecha have rounded edges, rather than the traditional blocky giant robot shapes. The characters are more than compelling--indeed, finding out what happened to all the characters is primarily what kept me watching. There are individual moments of immense tragic beauty, such as episode 19, which features some of the most brilliant concepts and sledge-hammer-to-the-chest emotional moments of the series; and incredible sweetness, such as the show's epilogue, which made every viewer in the room go ""Awwwwww"" and smile.Sadly, the ""big picture"" of the series is never really explained well; the plot gears never really mesh properly. I'm used to enigmatic and hard-to-understand anime (e.g., Boogiepop Phantom), and this was so confusing that I had to flee to Wikipedia mid-series to figure out what was going on. And while I was there, I read the summary of the entire plot, and when I got to the climax and resolution, I just didn't care.This series is worth watching, but not necessarily worth owning. Unless, of course, you like it. I would recommend viewing at least one or two DVDs before you commit to the entire series.I also *very* strongly recommend only using the Japanese language track. The English language track significantly exacerbates the show's flaws, and prevents the show's essential sweetness (its most redeeming quality) from coming through.",3,"Endearing characters, but ""big picture"" problems",1164412800,"11 25, 2006",2006,1526,"['had', 'unusual', 'reaction', 'series', 'did', ""n't"", 'exactly', '*like*', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'watching', 'mecha', 'design', 'standpoint', 'innovative', 'Mu', 'mecha', 'have', 'rounded', 'edges', 'rather', 'traditional', 'blocky', 'giant', 'robot', 'shapes', 'characters', 'are', 'more', 'compelling', 'indeed', 'finding', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'characters', 'primarily', 'what', 'kept', 'watching', 'are', 'individual', 'moments', 'immense', 'tragic', 'beauty', 'such', 'episode', '19', 'most', 'brilliant', 'concepts', 'sledge-hammer-to-the-chest', 'emotional', 'moments', 'series', 'incredible', 'sweetness', 'such', 'show', 'epilogue', 'made', 'viewer', 'room', 'go', 'Awwwwww', 'smile.Sadly', 'big', 'picture', 'series', 'never', 'really', 'explained', 'well', 'plot', 'gears', 'never', 'really', 'mesh', 'properly', ""'m"", 'used', 'enigmatic', 'hard-to-understand', 'anime', 'e.g.', 'Boogiepop', 'Phantom', 'was', 'so', 'confusing', 'had', 'flee', 'Wikipedia', 'mid-series', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'was', 'there', 'read', 'summary', 'entire', 'plot', 'when', 'got', 'climax', 'resolution', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'care.This', 'series', 'worth', 'watching', 'not', 'necessarily', 'worth', 'owning', 'Unless', 'course', 'would', 'recommend', 'viewing', 'least', 'one', 'two', 'DVDs', 'commit', 'entire', 'series.I', 'also', '*very*', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'only', 'using', 'Japanese', 'language', 'track', 'English', 'language', 'track', 'significantly', 'show', 'flaws', 'show', 'essential', 'sweetness', 'most', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'coming']",Rahxephon - Complete Collection
899898,A29Y34ALWJUGB5,B000929VA4,"Antonio D. Paolucci ""Collector of Entertainment""","[8, 9]","Rahxephon is a masterpiece. It has one of the smartest and original stories ever written, with characters that are easy to love and hate, depending on their role in the series. To add to that, Rahxephon has a soundtrack that perfectly matches both the mood of every scene, as well as the overall theme of the anime, and since this anime is based off of musical patterns, a good musical score is a must.But all that wasn't enough for me to give Rahxephon a five. It was actually the final two minutes of the twenty-sixth episode that caused me to give this series a five. While I won't describe it, and therefore spoil it, I'll say that it does everything and then some to fully explain what was actually going on between the two main characters of this series, Ayato and Haruka. To me, it was the perfect ending to a series that had me a bit puzzled until those last minutes, and I actually laughed out loud at the final words that flashed across the screen before it was finally over. So, advance warning, don't turn the final episode off until all the credits have rolled or else you'll miss one of the most important moments in the story.As for the story, Rahxephon follows a seventeen-year-old boy named Ayato who grows up believing that his small place in Tokyo is all that is left after an apocalypse. Yet this, as he learns quickly, is a lie, and Ayato soon finds himself the key tool in a battle against a race of alien creatures known as the Mu, who appear human in every aspect but their blue blood. Working for a military organization known as Terra, Ayato battles the Mu's Dolem, giant robotic creatures who use sound patterns as weapons, with his own giant robot, the Rahxephon. Along the way, Ayato meets a few friends, as well as experiencing some rather strange occurrences, including an illusionary girl, a few love interests, and a red-haired girl named Quan who seems to know more about Ayato than he does.Well, that's about the gist of the plot. Rahxephon is actually a difficult anime to explain. I can say that it's somewhat of a love story as well as a tale of apocalypse, with a large cast of characters. But still, I can promise that if ever there was a giant robo anime to come close to the success of Neon Genesis Evangelion, Rahxephon is it. It contains a story as smart as Eva, only a little less confusing. It has excellent animation and a lot of great action. And it has the aforementioned soundtrack, including what may be the best opening credit song to ever grace an anime. Get this if you love giant robo anime, or loved Eva. Also, if you like Studio BONES productions (Fullmetal Alchemist; Wolf's Rain; Eureka Seven), then this is definitely one you'd like to get.",5,It's Amazing What Two Minutes Could Do,1152057600,"07 5, 2006",2006,2700,"['Rahxephon', 'masterpiece', 'one', 'smartest', 'original', 'stories', 'ever', 'written', 'characters', 'are', 'easy', 'love', 'hate', 'depending', 'role', 'series', 'add', 'Rahxephon', 'soundtrack', 'perfectly', 'mood', 'scene', 'as', 'well', 'overall', 'theme', 'anime', 'anime', 'based', 'musical', 'patterns', 'good', 'musical', 'score', 'must.But', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'give', 'Rahxephon', 'five', 'was', 'actually', 'final', 'two', 'minutes', 'twenty-sixth', 'episode', 'caused', 'give', 'series', 'five', 'wo', ""n't"", 'describe', 'therefore', 'spoil', ""'ll"", 'say', 'everything', 'then', 'fully', 'explain', 'what', 'was', 'actually', 'going', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'series', 'Ayato', 'Haruka', 'was', 'perfect', 'ending', 'series', 'had', 'bit', 'puzzled', 'last', 'minutes', 'actually', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'final', 'words', 'flashed', 'screen', 'was', 'finally', 'over', 'So', 'advance', 'warning', 'do', ""n't"", 'turn', 'final', 'episode', 'credits', 'have', 'rolled', 'else', ""'ll"", 'miss', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'moments', 'story.As', 'story', 'Rahxephon', 'seventeen-year-old', 'boy', 'named', 'Ayato', 'who', 'up', 'believing', 'small', 'place', 'Tokyo', 'left', 'apocalypse', 'quickly', 'lie', 'Ayato', 'soon', 'key', 'tool', 'battle', 'race', 'alien', 'creatures', 'known', 'Mu', 'who', 'appear', 'human', 'aspect', 'blue', 'blood', 'Working', 'military', 'organization', 'known', 'Terra', 'Ayato', 'Mu', 'Dolem', 'giant', 'robotic', 'creatures', 'who', 'use', 'sound', 'patterns', 'weapons', 'own', 'giant', 'robot', 'Rahxephon', 'way', 'Ayato', 'few', 'friends', 'as', 'well', 'experiencing', 'rather', 'strange', 'occurrences', 'including', 'illusionary', 'girl', 'few', 'love', 'interests', 'red-haired', 'girl', 'named', 'Quan', 'who', 'know', 'more', 'Ayato', 'does.Well', 'gist', 'plot', 'Rahxephon', 'actually', 'difficult', 'anime', 'explain', 'can', 'say', 'somewhat', 'love', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'tale', 'apocalypse', 'large', 'cast', 'characters', 'still', 'can', 'promise', 'ever', 'was', 'giant', 'robo', 'anime', 'come', 'close', 'success', 'Neon', 'Genesis', 'Evangelion', 'Rahxephon', 'story', 'as', 'smart', 'Eva', 'only', 'little', 'less', 'confusing', 'excellent', 'animation', 'lot', 'great', 'action', 'aforementioned', 'soundtrack', 'including', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'opening', 'credit', 'song', 'ever', 'grace', 'anime', 'Get', 'love', 'giant', 'robo', 'anime', 'loved', 'Eva', 'Also', 'like', 'Studio', 'BONES', 'productions', 'Fullmetal', 'Alchemist', 'Wolf', 'Rain', 'Eureka', 'Seven', 'then', 'definitely', 'one', ""'d"", 'like', 'get']",Rahxephon - Complete Collection
899899,AGO5LRUVQLH0Q,B000929VA4,A. Schneider,"[16, 17]","Often enough this series is compared to NGE (Neon Genesis) and is blamed for following in its footsteps. In all honesty I find RahXephon extremely creative, thought provoking and well done. In its own right RahXephon stands out as possibly one of the very best ""mecha"" series to date, in a class and category all to itself!As a fan of thought provoking animes (preferring seriousness over humor and calm introspective moments for the characters over highly complicated battle sequences), I was deeply disappointed with NGE and many movies in the Gundam line... was it impossible to fuse high-technology robots with an intellectual storyline? Was it impossible to bring great voice acting, great animation and design together in one series?At first I thought I was asking a lot ... that was until I caught RahXephon on G4TV.RahXephon's art alone is superb. The series is drawn and animated quite beautifully, almost everything on the screen is highly detailed and appropriately colored. The series comes across as extremely stunning in comparison with other mecha-type shows. In other shows the artists sacrifice detail in order to bring you quick action sequences - RahXephon doesn't focus too much on the action sequences and instead brings you stunning visuals you're sure to remember.RahXephon features a creative storyline: a world in which music plays a key role in human events. Music literally shapes the world as a whole and when two races collide (Humans and Mulians); music might just be the world's only salvation. Through themes which were heavily researched (as apparent in the Italian musical notation names of the Dolem - enemy Mu fighting units - and through the use of clever poetry to foreshadow events to come), RahXephon's storyline is one of the most engaging storylines in a mecha-type show I've seen.RahXephon is a story about uncertainty, taking risks, and exploring the nature of reality. And yet for all the major themes present, through the use of downright loveable characters (who are aesthetically pleasing as well as interesting), we see a world ""suffused with sound"" in all of its magnificence.An anime great. I recommend this series to anyone with any interest in mecha combat mixed with a heavy story! Those with a good grasp on what makes a quality Japanese animation are bound to enjoy RahXephon!",5,Truly a great series!,1135209600,"12 22, 2005",2005,2332,"['Often', 'enough', 'series', 'compared', 'NGE', 'Neon', 'Genesis', 'blamed', 'following', 'footsteps', 'honesty', 'find', 'RahXephon', 'extremely', 'creative', 'thought', 'provoking', 'well', 'done', 'own', 'right', 'RahXephon', 'out', 'possibly', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'mecha', 'series', 'date', 'class', 'category', 'fan', 'thought', 'provoking', 'animes', 'preferring', 'seriousness', 'humor', 'calm', 'introspective', 'moments', 'characters', 'highly', 'complicated', 'battle', 'sequences', 'was', 'deeply', 'disappointed', 'NGE', 'many', 'movies', 'Gundam', 'line', 'was', 'impossible', 'fuse', 'high-technology', 'robots', 'intellectual', 'storyline', 'Was', 'impossible', 'bring', 'great', 'voice', 'acting', 'great', 'animation', 'design', 'together', 'one', 'series', 'first', 'thought', 'was', 'asking', 'lot', 'was', 'caught', 'RahXephon', 'G4TV.RahXephon', 'art', 'alone', 'superb', 'series', 'drawn', 'animated', 'quite', 'beautifully', 'almost', 'everything', 'screen', 'highly', 'detailed', 'appropriately', 'colored', 'series', 'extremely', 'stunning', 'comparison', 'other', 'mecha-type', 'shows', 'other', 'shows', 'artists', 'sacrifice', 'detail', 'order', 'bring', 'quick', 'action', 'sequences', 'RahXephon', ""n't"", 'focus', 'too', 'much', 'action', 'sequences', 'instead', 'brings', 'stunning', 'visuals', ""'re"", 'sure', 'remember.RahXephon', 'features', 'creative', 'storyline', 'world', 'music', 'key', 'role', 'human', 'events', 'Music', 'literally', 'world', 'whole', 'when', 'two', 'races', 'collide', 'Humans', 'Mulians', 'music', 'might', 'just', 'be', 'world', 'only', 'salvation', 'themes', 'were', 'heavily', 'researched', 'apparent', 'Italian', 'musical', 'notation', 'names', 'Dolem', 'enemy', 'Mu', 'fighting', 'units', 'use', 'clever', 'poetry', 'foreshadow', 'events', 'come', 'RahXephon', 'storyline', 'one', 'most', 'engaging', 'storylines', 'mecha-type', 'show', ""'ve"", 'seen.RahXephon', 'story', 'uncertainty', 'taking', 'risks', 'exploring', 'nature', 'reality', 'yet', 'major', 'themes', 'present', 'use', 'downright', 'loveable', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'aesthetically', 'pleasing', 'as', 'well', 'interesting', 'see', 'world', 'suffused', 'sound', 'magnificence.An', 'anime', 'great', 'recommend', 'series', 'anyone', 'interest', 'mecha', 'combat', 'mixed', 'heavy', 'story', 'good', 'grasp', 'what', 'quality', 'Japanese', 'animation', 'are', 'bound', 'enjoy', 'RahXephon']",Rahxephon - Complete Collection
899900,AM9YB0BKXFH7Z,B000929VA4,"B. Ackley ""jumpstudios""","[75, 77]","""RahXephon- Complete collection"" repackages the 2003 7 disc TV series from ADV Films into a space saving thinpak collection. The orginal cover art is used but buyers wont get the dvd character booklets that accompanied the original release nor is the motion picture included. The series does come in a stylish collectors box with new artwork. If you missed RahXephon the first time don't hesitate to pick up this amazing series.RahXephon was at first dismissed by some as a clone of Neon Genesis Evangelion with it the similar idea of a protagonist (in this case Ayato Kamina) reluctant to use the giant mecha RahXephon to fight otherworldly invaders. Those who watched the show realised thats where the similarities end.RahXephon is the story of high schooler Ayato Kamina, a ordinary guy living in Tokyo, the last city on Earth that didnt fall to invaders the MU. The citizens of Tokyo are constantly aware that invasion could happen at any point and in the first episode it does. During the attack Ayato is seperated from his friends and meets up with another classmate Reika who takes him to an underground room where she awakens the RahXEphon and makes Ayato become one with the hulking mecha. Ayato is able to escape the city using the RahXephon where he soon learns Tokyo is actually controlled by the MU.Over the course of the series Ayato has to unravel the truth of the world, come to grips with his own personal demons and decide how he is connected to the RahXEphon.The series does a great job of storytelling. The first episode quickly throws many questions at the viewer and has you wondering just what is the truth in the world of RahXephon. The pacing of the story is excellent. Viewers are given just enough answers to questions to keep them satisfied while having new questions crop up. The show will keep you guessing until the end.A phenomenal anime that has action, romance, comedy, big mecha and lots of mystery- truly something for everyone.

899902,A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,B000929VA4,"Christopher Barrett ""Evil Corgi""","[4, 6]","If you want to know the storyline, read another review.  I am posting my opinions about this series without delving into the plot too much:First of all, I am a huge fan of Evangelion (except the last two episodes).  Many giant mecha animes are thinly veiled rip-offs of this original story.  At first it seems that Rah Xephon is a more colorful and better animated version of Eva.  After the second episode I changed my mind.What sets Rah Xephon apart from other animes first and foremost is the superb characterization.  This is one of the greatest casts of characters in anime.Ayato Kamina is the stereotypical young male hero, but his melancholy soon is replaced with a kind of peace and he finds happiness despite the troubles in the world.  Haruka and the others at TERRA are also well rounded and likeable.  Some of the secondary characters appear constantly throught the series but have little development, though this is hardly a negative point as the cast of primary characters numbers at least 20.The story is unique and well written.  It does of course bear a striking similarity to Hitchcock's Vertigo and some other classic sci-fi movies and novels.Sometimes the battle scenes are a little boring, since the Rah Xephon doesn't really move too much.  I suppose that the art is so intricate that the team did not want to spend all of their time and money creating animation cells for it.Like Evangelion, the ending leaves a lot to be disired, but it does give one food for thought.  Unlike Eva, the last episode is as beautifully animated as the first.  The only other sci-fi animes that comes close to Rah Xephon are Gundam Seed and Evangelion.  Do yourself a favor and buy the whole series.

899903,A3PEN0MCANLUOK,B000929VA4,Coulter Rail,"[0, 2]","I took a chance on Rahxephon despite the flow of opinions stating that it borrows too heavily from Evangelion.  I can understand being inspired and borrowing themes and elements from a successful story.  Hell, all stories are derived somewhat from one another.In the first 2 episodes I saw the similarities and waited patiently for them to branch off into their own story.  It never happened, and I felt insulted for the creator of Eva with every episode.  The style, the characters, the boys connection to his mech, the angel/Christian overtones, the obligatory cutaways meant to evoke meaning, the music, the strategic differences in the enemies, the clandestine organization, the mother complex, the joining with the mech to form a Godlike creator.  It was gross.I tried to pretend that this show had its own mind and isn't a poorly crafted knockoff, so I could review its production value as if I had never seen Eva.The animation is adequate, but doesn't inspire much.  The music is repetitive and a little out of place, but not horrible.  The characters are dull and their psychological state is an open book.  The ideas and revelations only mean something if you decide that they do.  The pacing and narrative are all over the place because they were given 26 episodes and didn't know what to do with all that time.  Even if Eva didn't exist this would still be a very poor product.I just goes to show you that execution is king.

Mower,"[0, 0]","It sounds silly, but watched RahXephon as an ""alternative"" to EVA because I'm actually a little turned off by the constant Evangelion hype that I hear and read about. I read several reviews that described RahXephon as ""Evangelion done right"". I have no idea if it's true or not, but I decided to give this anime a look before Eva just to go against the flow.This show is phenomenal, but it took me a while to come to this realization, mainly because the story is very intricate and requires a good deal of thought to comprehend. It is not a series that you can watch casually and enjoy. I had to re-watch the ending to try and piece things together. After I had time to digest it, I realized that I really liked it, and more than that, I was impressed by the sheer quality of this show, from production values to English voice work.The first thing this series had going for me was the character designs and the animation quality. Both get very high marks. The characters are believably conceived and drawn and lends this series to an almost live action feel, for me anyway. Out of any anime I've watched, this one feels the most targeted to intelligent adult audiences and its real-world characters emphasized this fact. The music is also very unique and memorable and gives the show a similarly mature touch.The plot line in this show is quite complex. It ranges from mystery to sci-fi to action to romance, and in my opinion does an excellent job at intertwining them all. It is not so much a ""giant mecha"" show as a show about the inherent worth of humanity. After I began to piece it together, I really, really enjoyed the irregular romantic story developed in RahXephon. It was very unique and enjoyable to watch develop. I also found the references to 2012 and Mayan culture particularly interesting, since there is a lot of hype about the year 2012 right now. The idea of re-tuning the world was intriguing to me and is actually a theme that I've heard before regarding the year 2012.Like a number of other shows I've seen, it starts by focusing in on one character and then expands the story to take in a large number of side characters and eventually expands until it is literally cosmic in nature. And being cosmic in nature, RahXephon comments on humans place in the cosmos, and caps off great tragedy with great hope, which I really appreciated.As far as an age rating is concerned, I'd rate this one as 18+. There's not too much objectionable here...there is a scene where Ayato is dreaming and the Haruka in his dream attempts to seduce him, as well as a few shots of Quon in her underwear and the classic beach bikini episode, but there was nothing that I was really offended by. The series does not make a point out of fanservice, but the female characters are well-proportioned and there are a couple of potentially awkward moments that pass quickly.A highly recommended series that stands on its own as a great work.",5,Stand-alone review from someone who hasn't seen Evangelion,1243123200,"05 24, 2009",2009,2934,"['silly', 'watched', 'RahXephon', 'alternative', 'EVA', ""'m"", 'actually', 'little', 'turned', 'off', 'constant', 'Evangelion', 'hype', 'hear', 'read', 'read', 'several', 'reviews', 'described', 'RahXephon', 'Evangelion', 'done', 'right', 'have', 'idea', 'true', 'not', 'decided', 'give', 'anime', 'look', 'Eva', 'just', 'go', 'flow.This', 'show', 'phenomenal', 'took', 'while', 'come', 'realization', 'mainly', 'story', 'very', 'intricate', 'good', 'deal', 'thought', 'comprehend', 'not', 'series', 'can', 'watch', 'casually', 'enjoy', 'had', 're-watch', 'ending', 'try', 'piece', 'things', 'together', 'had', 'time', 'digest', 'realized', 'really', 'liked', 'more', 'was', 'impressed', 'sheer', 'quality', 'show', 'production', 'values', 'English', 'voice', 'work.The', 'first', 'thing', 'series', 'had', 'going', 'was', 'character', 'designs', 'animation', 'quality', 'get', 'very', 'high', 'marks', 'characters', 'are', 'believably', 'conceived', 'drawn', 'series', 'almost', 'live', 'action', 'feel', 'anyway', 'anime', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'one', 'most', 'targeted', 'intelligent', 'adult', 'audiences', 'real-world', 'characters', 'emphasized', 'fact', 'music', 'also', 'very', 'unique', 'memorable', 'show', 'similarly', 'mature', 'touch.The', 'plot', 'line', 'show', 'quite', 'complex', 'mystery', 'sci-fi', 'action', 'romance', 'opinion', 'excellent', 'job', 'intertwining', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'giant', 'mecha', 'show', 'show', 'inherent', 'worth', 'humanity', 'began', 'piece', 'together', 'really', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'irregular', 'romantic', 'story', 'developed', 'RahXephon', 'was', 'very', 'unique', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'develop', 'also', 'found', 'references', '2012', 'Mayan', 'culture', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'lot', 'hype', 'year', '2012', 'right', 'now', 'idea', 're-tuning', 'world', 'was', 'intriguing', 'actually', 'theme', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'regarding', 'year', '2012.Like', 'number', 'other', 'shows', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'focusing', 'one', 'character', 'then', 'story', 'take', 'large', 'number', 'side', 'characters', 'eventually', 'literally', 'cosmic', 'nature', 'being', 'cosmic', 'nature', 'RahXephon', 'comments', 'humans', 'place', 'cosmos', 'caps', 'off', 'great', 'tragedy', 'great', 'hope', 'really', 'appreciated.As', 'far', 'age', 'rating', 'concerned', ""'d"", 'rate', 'one', '18+', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'objectionable', 'here', 'scene', 'where', 'Ayato', 'dreaming', 'Haruka', 'dream', 'attempts', 'seduce', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'shots', 'Quon', 'underwear', 'classic', 'beach', 'bikini', 'episode', 'was', 'nothing', 'was', 'really', 'offended', 'series', 'not', 'make', 'point', 'fanservice', 'female', 'characters', 'are', 'well-proportioned', 'are', 'couple', 'potentially', 'awkward', 'moments', 'pass', 'quickly.A', 'highly', 'recommended', 'series', 'own', 'great', 'work']",Rahxephon - Complete Collection

899907,A3E68QNSCABRVW,B000929VA4,"Gradient Vector Field ""subjectedtometal (dot)...","[1, 4]","This was yet another interesting Mecha Anime that I came across.  I've noticed I tend to prefer the far more mechanical Mechs you see in things like Mechwarrior, but the Animes seem to favor a more organic or humanoid styled Mech.  Maybe it's to make them seem like they're more than just a machine, which is the case in the instance of RahXephon.  Despite the fact I'm not too big on the creature designs the stories are still very good and quite enjoyable!  Don't get me wrong, the creatures are still drawn quite well and the rest of the art is very nice.We are first brought into the world of Ayato Kamina.  He seems kind of out of touch with reality, but in most Anime's like this the main character has a destiny to fulfill.  Like other Anime's I've watched the characters are usually between the ages of fourteen and eighteen and in this case Ayato is seventeen.  We see this used commonly in things like Serial Experiments Lain, Last Exile, Burst Angel, and Neon Genesis Evangelion.  I guess that's the perfect age for things to get interesting.  Also like many others I've seen so far start off with a seemingly normal world, lively and normal... except for our out of touch main character.  However, there's a major twist because the world has pretty much been destroyed and the only city left is Tokyo.  The world's population has been reduced to a mere twenty-three million!  How could this happen?  Apparently otherworldly beings called the Mu attacked Earth, but only Tokyo managed to survive.  As in most other Anime's not everything is as it seems... an air of mystery comes about and something is amiss with the world.  The synopsis would technically be much greater than that, but I don't want to give away the mystery or the awe of the world you get to enjoy through this Anime.I suppose this Anime parallel's Neon Genesis Evangelion quite a bit, but with a major pro in my book.  At the end of this series we get at least a decently logical conclusion!  They don't go off into any overly philosophical episodes that may or may not have anything to do with the series.  This story really does begin and end within the series and we really didn't quite get that in Neon Genesis Evangelion.  Do I think that RahXephon is better?  Actually... no.  I think Neon Genesis Evangelion was a much more profound series, along with being much deeper and I liked the premise behind their Mechs a lot more as well.  Despite all the borrowing and influence from various other Animes I think RahXephon managed to construct a decently original universe for us to enjoy and not feel like it's a blatant rip off of another series.I really did enjoy the world they created for this Anime, but there are a few misgivings that I think really held it back from reaching its true potential.  A major downside to this series is the huge cast.  It feels like the normal twenty-six episode length is far too short to encompass all the kinds of character depth we need.  At the end I was left with too many questions about Ayato's mother for example.  She's a very mysterious character and they explain a lot, but I think there should've been a lot more for us to see.  There are some expertly written twists and turns throughout the series, but the drama is really what drove my interest in this show.  Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy the action sequences quite a bit, but like many of the Mecha shows I've seen thus far it seems like they force the action sequences in some episodes.  As if they need to fit at least one action sequence into EVERY episode.  There is plenty of drama and story to build on that they don't necessarily need this.  In fact I wanted more of the dramatic elements and background story of some of the characters.An interesting thing with this DVD set is that there are extras on every disc and these include various interviews with the creators and voice actors.  In the end I enjoyed this series quite a bit.  Not as profound as some other series I've seen, but it's quite good while it lasts.  The last parts involving the God designer character are brilliant and that's the main part where you get a taste of some philosophical notions.  If you enjoy a good Mecha with a complex story then I would recommend RahXephon.  Just be forewarned that the cast is unnecessarily huge and you won't find out everything about every character.  This is unfortunate, but I can't deny that the world and story are still good in the end.3.5 out of 5.",3,A very interesting world for us to see...,1217980800,"08 6, 2008",2008,4459,"['was', 'yet', 'interesting', 'Mecha', 'Anime', 'came', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'tend', 'prefer', 'far', 'more', 'mechanical', 'Mechs', 'see', 'things', 'Mechwarrior', 'Animes', 'seem', 'favor', 'more', 'organic', 'humanoid', 'styled', 'Mech', 'Maybe', 'make', 'seem', ""'re"", 'more', 'just', 'machine', 'case', 'instance', 'RahXephon', 'fact', ""'m"", 'not', 'too', 'big', 'creature', 'stories', 'are', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'creatures', 'are', 'still', 'drawn', 'quite', 'well', 'rest', 'art', 'very', 'nice.We', 'are', 'first', 'brought', 'world', 'Ayato', 'Kamina', 'kind', 'touch', 'reality', 'most', 'Anime', 'main', 'character', 'destiny', 'fulfill', 'other', 'Anime', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'characters', 'are', 'usually', 'ages', 'fourteen', 'eighteen', 'case', 'Ayato', 'seventeen', 'see', 'used', 'commonly', 'things', 'Serial', 'Experiments', 'Lain', 'Last', 'Exile', 'Burst', 'Angel', 'Neon', 'Genesis', 'Evangelion', 'guess', 'perfect', 'age', 'things', 'get', 'interesting', 'Also', 'many', 'others', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'start', 'off', 'seemingly', 'normal', 'world', 'lively', 'normal', 'touch', 'main', 'character', 'However', 'major', 'twist', 'world', 'pretty', 'much', 'been', 'destroyed', 'only', 'city', 'left', 'Tokyo', 'world', 'population', 'been', 'reduced', 'mere', 'twenty-three', 'million', 'How', 'could', 'happen', 'Apparently', 'otherworldly', 'beings', 'called', 'Mu', 'attacked', 'Earth', 'only', 'Tokyo', 'managed', 'survive', 'most', 'other', 'Anime', 'not', 'everything', 'air', 'mystery', 'about', 'something', 'amiss', 'world', 'synopsis', 'would', 'technically', 'be', 'much', 'greater', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'mystery', 'awe', 'world', 'get', 'enjoy', 'Anime.I', 'suppose', 'Anime', 'parallel', 'Neon', 'Genesis', 'Evangelion', 'quite', 'bit', 'major', 'pro', 'book', 'end', 'series', 'get', 'least', 'decently', 'logical', 'conclusion', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'off', 'overly', 'philosophical', 'episodes', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'series', 'story', 'really', 'begin', 'end', 'series', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', 'Neon', 'Genesis', 'Evangelion', 'Do', 'think', 'RahXephon', 'better', 'Actually', 'think', 'Neon', 'Genesis', 'Evangelion', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'profound', 'series', 'being', 'much', 'deeper', 'liked', 'premise', 'Mechs', 'lot', 'more', 'as', 'well', 'borrowing', 'influence', 'various', 'other', 'Animes', 'think', 'RahXephon', 'managed', 'construct', 'decently', 'original', 'universe', 'enjoy', 'not', 'feel', 'blatant', 'rip', 'series.I', 'really', 'did', 'enjoy', 'world', 'created', 'Anime', 'are', 'few', 'misgivings', 'think', 'really', 'held', 'back', 'reaching', 'true', 'potential', 'major', 'downside', 'series', 'huge', 'cast', 'normal', 'twenty-six', 'episode', 'length', 'far', 'too', 'short', 'encompass', 'kinds', 'character', 'depth', 'need', 'end', 'was', 'left', 'too', 'many', 'questions', 'Ayato', 'mother', 'example', 'very', 'mysterious', 'character', 'explain', 'lot', 'think', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'lot', 'more', 'see', 'are', 'expertly', 'written', 'twists', 'series', 'drama', 'really', 'what', 'drove', 'interest', 'show', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'did', 'enjoy', 'action', 'quite', 'bit', 'many', 'Mecha', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'thus', 'far', 'force', 'action', 'sequences', 'episodes', 'need', 'fit', 'least', 'one', 'action', 'sequence', 'EVERY', 'episode', 'plenty', 'drama', 'story', 'build', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'need', 'fact', 'wanted', 'more', 'dramatic', 'elements', 'background', 'story', 'characters.An', 'interesting', 'thing', 'DVD', 'set', 'are', 'extras', 'disc', 'include', 'various', 'interviews', 'creators', 'voice', 'actors', 'end', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'quite', 'bit', 'Not', 'as', 'profound', 'other', 'series', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quite', 'good', 'last', 'parts', 'involving', 'God', 'designer', 'character', 'are', 'brilliant', 'main', 'part', 'where', 'get', 'taste', 'philosophical', 'notions', 'enjoy', 'good', 'Mecha', 'complex', 'story', 'then', 'would', 'recommend', 'RahXephon', 'Just', 'be', 'forewarned', 'cast', 'unnecessarily', 'huge', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'out', 'everything', 'character', 'unfortunate', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deny', 'world', 'story', 'are', 'still', 'good', 'end.3.5', '5']",Rahxephon - Complete Collection

That being said I was hoping Rah-Xephon would be another outstanding Mecha Anime that provoked thought and innovative ideas, but it just doesn't hit the mark.I purchased the 7 disc thin pack box set.  The box is actually sturdy and has some pretty cool art work.  Still this Anime is one of the more pricy series I have purchased.From the first episode to the last I could not believe how similar this series was to Evangelion.  The storylines were very similar that is with some slight modifications to scarcely prevent copyright infringements.  So we have similar storylines, that is fine I think it is a great storyline but the actual animation of Rah just didn't hold up.A sci-fi mecha series should have at the least intense battles between machines.  I don't believe that the Rah-Xephon took damage in battle more than once or twice through 26 episodes.  Not much fun when the Hero mecha Rah continually cuts the enemy in half with a new weapon he just discovered he had.  The Rah has no struggle in battling Dolem after Dolem, to me this is not exciting.  I had a major problem with this issue while watching this series.  And the whole making the Dolems and Rah such wonderful singing devices was a bit much.The storyline will become increasingly hard to follow.  You have to make sure you are fully cohesive while watching and even then It would difficult to follow.  I still don't understand how all the characters are related to one another.The main character and pilot of the Rah Ayoto Kamina was not a character I could connect with.  It wasn't just Ayoto, I couldn't seem to connect with a single character in this series.  I could tell they wanted to make this story into a major drama but in doing so I think they sacrificed everything else it could have been.  Even so I found the characters to lack major development and likeability.  Also I didn't think anyone could scream insanely more than Shinji Akari in EVA but Ayoto Kamina blows him out of the water in Rah.I thought the artwork in Rah was of average quality, it was easy on the eyes but still nothing groundbreaking here.Ill stop babbling and get to the end.Where have I seen an ending like this before? The hero becomes one with his Mecha and rebirths the world.So if you're looking for an expensive & average mecha series pick this up.  If you have seen Evangelion and are a fan do not bother getting this anime, basically a waste of money and time.

Grissom ""JF""","[2, 2]","One of the keys to Raxephon is a much friendlier story for an american audience compared to Eva (I loved them both, but saw Eva first so it holds a warm place for me.)Ayato is about a zillion times better than Shinji.I agree the themes are the same and Evaxephon dot com clearly points this out so I won't even bother to go there. (It hardly seems worth getting upset over... especially when kids are starving all over the world... hehe getting angry over anime seems pretty trivial in the grand scheme of things.)Forgive me if this is pretty abstracted from the story... I'm trying to not give too much away to anyone interested in picking this up.Without spoiling it I would say that love story is complete, even though it isn't traditional in its final stages.There are some plot twists in the love story that are genuinely satisfying. The twists answer a lot of questions about Reika's significance and Haruka's ""seemingly"" unprovoked (and often unacknowledged) concern for our hero Ayato.There is a lot here that is good.The story is well delivered.The characters are deep an interesting.The crisis has a great bit of time distortion, and the story plays head games with this very well.If one had never seen Eva: In the end this is really hard to say anything bad about.The animation is solid and in some cases just breathtaking.The production quality is very high.The growth of each character in the story is obvious... and reasonable... and therefore believable.There isn't much, if any, fan service in the way of visuals, BUT there are some characters that have a very sultry demeanor that is very appealing. Some of the characters hit the sexy buttons on all eight cylinders, without showing a bunch of skin... that is really solid feat if you ask me. Less is more in this one when it comes to fan service.I didn't give this 5 stars because, as good as it was... there was something about it that felt a tad empty. Almost like some pieces were unresolved. I'm not sure. Perhaps it was the music? Kinda haunting and menacing... I'm not sure. What I do know is simple, in the end I wasn't moved. Satisfied but not emotionally shaken from my seat, if you know what I mean.I borrowed this from a friend and now that I have seen it I'm buying it, so that should really be enough to tell you what I think of it.

If you are looking for action, romance, cerebral content, and an ultimately moving series, this anime is for you.  If you are looking for absurdly esoteric symbolism, heaps of angst, and a snobbish fan base, you have stumbled onto the wrong series.While Rahxephon does have a fair share of symbolism, foreshadowing, and brain teasers, it is NOT needlessly convoluted, unlike Evangelion.  As to comparisons between the two, Rahxephon and Evangelion are similar only so far as they both involve humanoid mechs, a male main character, and an epic story.  Other than that, Rahxephon is its own series.  If you enjoy character-focused action/romance/drama/comedy anime with minimal angst, this series will not disappoint.  Please do note that the focus of the series is actually not on combat for combat's sake.  While this anime has plenty of action, such encounters act merely as a portion of the orchestra that makes up the symphony that is Rahxephon.Technical Note: This set contains the complete 26 episode long series and (at least mine) does come with the Rahxephon movie, located at the end of the series.Important Note: If you receive the same set I did, the movie starts after the credits of the 26th episode, the last episode of the series.  A lot of people seem to have accidentally mistaken the movie as the series restarting.  Don't do that!  The movie focuses on explaining certain aspects of the series.  While it does use a lot of footage from the series, it alters it a good deal and adds on it.  Pay close attention to the dialogue in the first five minutes.

Burdick ""Zombie Golf Caddy""","[33, 42]","First off, I loved Rah and hated Eva, so keep that in mind reading this. ;)As I added to my Eva review here, Eva did it first, but Rah did it RIGHT.Other people have said Rah blows you away for visuals, and they're right.  The Last Exile was the only series I've seen that's on par with the beautiful art here.The beginning's a bit hectic to be sure, but after the mess that was Evangelion, I was willing to sit it out for a few episodes.  Boy am I glad I did!You won't even notice when Rah works its subtle charm on you, but you'll suddenly realize you're connecting pieces of the story and really getting involved.Eva NEVER gave me a similar moment, most of that's weak ""what if"" at best.  RahXephon took the entirely different road with their ideas.  If you watch to the end and then think about each and every instance, Rah DOES make sense.  The wierd happenings all are understandable, something Eva didn't seem to bother with at all.As to why the Mu only sent out Dolems one at a time?  Unlike Eva's Angels which really DIDN'T make sense to be attacking solo, the Mu weren't after conquest.  Their whole motive was to awaken Rah.  This's why they don't outright try to kill Xephon in the first episode.  See?  Like I said, Rah makes sense!Don't even get me started on character differences.  Night and day, baby.  Rah's populace is heroic and act like actual humans, for the most part.  None of the gloom and doom from Eva.  As a result, you actually give a damn about them.  The underpinning main romance will have ya jumping up and down in your chair screaming ""Just tell him!"", it's that well written.And the biggest point in favor of RahXephon?  It's resolved.  All the philospies and long episodes go somewhere.  There's no jumbled mess at the end of Rah.  The ending, while ambiguous except for a few characters, is an ending.  An ending a HUMAN would choose if given Rah's choices.  Eva forgot that it was dealing with humans somewhere, instead turning them all into fatalistic robots with a deathwish in the second half.Eva did it first, but RahXephon did it right.

899917,A2A8PN3Q5QVNR6,B000929VA4,Suzanne,"[32, 43]","I'm really torn when it comes to RahXephon. See, I did something stupid... I saw Evangelion and fell in love with it. Hungry for something similar, I read the glowing reviews for RahXephon and bought it, hoping for another intelligent, profound series. On my first viewing (too soon after Eva) I hated it. No, I despised it! It blatantly 'borrows' a ton of ideas, themes, scenes, and dialogue from Eva. Those who say it doesn't aren't looking. (A site called EvaXephon has 17 pages worth of these similarities for those interested.) As my Eva-mania cooled down, and I reflected on Rah, I thought perhaps I'd been too harsh. So I recently re-watched it. This time I didn't find the similarities as disturbing. In fact, I actually found myself enjoying this series, especially towards the end. But I still found many flaws that detract from it. First, I will discuss those flaws, but end on a high note with what this series does right.FLAWS:Rah's biggest flaw is its poor execution of PRaT (Pace, Rhythm, and Timing). This series jumps and jerks around with wild shifts in pace, little rhythm to its edits and narrative flow, and a lack of timing in execution. Ep. 11 is a good example: The viewer is thrust immediately into a fight between the Xephon and a Dolem with no explanation of how this came about. The Dolem ""swallows"" Xephon, sending the hero, Kamina Ayato into an alternate dimension-like state. This is one episode borrowed from Eva, but the real problem is lack of setup. To believe in the altered state that is happening to the hero, we have to have a setup and a flow of events. Another example is the train sequence in the final episode. Again, this idea is ripped from Eva...  but this scene makes no sense in regards to the rhythm of Rah's narrative and sticks out like a sore thumb.I'm extremely sensitive to PRAT when it comes to art (long series especially). Series that flow logically have more impact and make it easier to get involved. Rah's lack of good PRaT shows a hackjob on the part of its creators who had many good ""ideas"", but weren't able to put them together in logical, rhythmic order.Rah's second flaw is in its cast. Rah has a monstrous cast, but the problem is with the focus of the series. Rah was intent on bringing every character into the mix with a story and multiple, intertwining relationships. The problem with this is that characters who seem important early on disappear for episodes, and characters that seem unimportant early on dominate the later episodes. They really needed more episodes in order for this method to work. Without them, they should've just focused on a few. It's not that these stories are bad, but just rather shallow due to the lack of time spent developing them.Rah's third flaw is in its characters. I thought most were poorly conceived. Eva, by comparison, went to great lengths developing characters with specific personalities. Eva's characters always acted and interacted in an honest manner regarding their personality. But Rah's characters often seem wooden. Ayato especially has as much flavor and personality as cardboard. I neither love or hate him. My apathy towards him is reflective of his apathy towards everything. I think the most interesting characters are under-developed. Quon is always intriguing, but she's never given a proper story. Megumi is a fun personality that fades into the background, only to emerge too late. In the end, I just didn't feel like I really knew any of the characters, and just didn't care what happened to them. This might just be a matter of personal taste, but I think Eva had superior characterization, even if their characters were often unlikable.Rah's fourth flaw is how contrived much of its drama is. This goes back to PRAT and lack of development. Ep. 18/19 is a prime example; Ayato and Hiroko develop a relationship VERY quickly late in 18. The ending of 19, which should be the most poignant in the series, instead seems mawkish and sloppy due to the dearth of story development. A series for audiences with any kind of attention span can't just arbitrarily introduce characters and relationships, give them a ""tragic ending"" and expect intelligent viewers to fall for it.Rah's fifth flaw is in its extra-contextual elements. Its ""philosophy"" is so trite as to be laughable. I especially got a chuckle out of Ayato's ""I am me because I will remain me because I am myself"" talk, which has been recycled to death. if Rah succeeds as a sci-fi narrative, it fails miserably as a work with something to say. I can't help but think these aspects were thrown in for pretentious reasons solely because Eva had them.Rah's final flaw is in its ""big picture"". Rah has some great parts and ideas but as a ""complete work"" it comes up short. Great albums are those where each song serves a larger purpose in the structure and context of the album. Series are the same with episodes. Episodes exist both singularly, but also as one piece to a bigger puzzle. In Rah's case, many pieces just don't fit. And while they may work as stand-alones, they don't enhance the overall work, and this again goes back to poor PRAT.STRENGTHS:With all the negatives I had to say about Rah, I still think it works well as an interesting piece of science fiction. Here are what I consider its greatest strengths:Rah's style is a rich tapestry influenced by a variety of art (music, literature, visual arts, mythology and culture). These aspects are integrated seamlessly into the narrative, making it unique and captivating stylistically. Visually, it's gorgeous with very fluid animation. The character and mech designs are phenomenal, with great color usage that's thematically relevant. The visuals evoke a type of mesmeric painting, while the music evokes a sense of enchanting mystery and nostalgia. The series bases much of its story on time and music, so this was a crucial aspect, and it works. Literature, religion, myths, and cultures are also used to shape Rah's style. The RahXephon page on Wikipedia discusses many of its influences in terms of art and culture. It's really fascinating, and perhaps the most alluring reason to watch Rah.I think Rah actually succeeds extremely well as a pure sci-fi narrative. Many of the ideas it uses were interesting until the end. The series gets more compelling in the later episodes. From ep. 19 on it's hard not to get engrossed in the story, wondering how it's going to end. The final episodes are a whirlwind of revelations and one big twist after another. It's enough to leave any viewer's head spinning. Rah's narrative is fairly complex and worth dissecting for those who aren't satisfied with the surface aspects. The character relationships, while a bit shallow, are also fun to follow, to see how they conclude.The finale is extraordinary in its artistic vision. If I hadn't seen End of Evangelion before seeing Rah, then it would certainly fall under the mind-blowing category. They have a bit of a ""been there, done that"" feeling, but it's extremely well executed and visually stunning. While Rah will probably leave you with some questions, it resolves most of its main narrative in a fairly complete and conclusive manner.The voice acting is also exceptional. In rare anime fashion, the dub is almost equal to the sub. Though I still give the edge to the sub (some GREAT performances from its cast), the dub is adequate for those who despise subtitles.CONCLUSION:As one critic stated, ""Rah is like Eva lite: Tastes good but less filling."" For me, Rah is a good but very flawed series. It's a bit pretentious and fails intellectually, but succeeds with its imaginative sci-fi narrative and rich, vibrant visual style. It has enough depth to give the viewer something to contemplate, but isn't nearly as demanding of its audience as Eva. While I still consider Eva a vastly superior artistic work, Rah is a good alternative for those who find Eva too complex, depressing and demanding. This is perhaps why most either love Rah and hate Eva or vice versa. One works more as fun, light entertainment (Rah), while the other works better as a mature, complex work of art (Eva). For casual audiences, Rah would likely be preferred. For those (like myself) who enjoy a challenge, Eva is a deeper, more rewarding work.I do feel that both works deserve a lot of merit for what they accomplished. Despite their similarities, the essence of both in what they (tried to) achieve are quite different. I've yet to experience a visual work as endlessly fascinating as Eva. But for those who didn't latch onto it emotionally or intellectually, Rah might be just what you're looking for.",3,Entertaining Sci-Fi Anime with Several Glaring Flaws,1184284800,"07 13,
