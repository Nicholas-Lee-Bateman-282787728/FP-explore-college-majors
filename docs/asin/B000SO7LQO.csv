1087201,A1LJR5IS0B6ADX,B000SO7LQO,"The Straw Man ""J.E. Hoppock""","[28, 61]","I have to say that FX is one of the few networks on television that is bold enough and has the audacity (meant in a good way) to bring such wonderful shows as Nip/Tuck and Rescue Me.  Being a HUGE fan of both of the former, I decided to give Dirt a try.  I was apparently exposed to it enough as it was promoted to the extreme throughout season 4 of Nip/Tuck.  It seemed like it might have some interesting elements and bring some of the same flare that other series on FX showcased.When the first episode/pilot aired I was a bit interested enough to watch the next episode.  However, after the third episode I realized that FX series only run about 13 to 14 episodes.  Therefore, there really isn't a whole a lot of time to work with, especially when many other television series product about twice as many episodes in a season.  I figured if the show didn't get better by the fifth episode, I was going to drop it.Well the fifth episode came and gone and I was still watching.  I suppose good marketing by the creators, yet part of me felt ""I have watched it this far, it has to get better"".  It never did.  As a matter of fact the show just became more and more ridiculous.  It was getting to the point where I was laughing every week at how dim, slow and obtuse the episodes were progressing.  Is this the good marketing the creators were intending to induce?At a core level I think I understand what FX and Courteney Cox were doing.  They were trying to make a very racy show that REALLY pushed the envelope by using the world of Hollywood/stardom and trashy news reporting.  In conception I must admit it is a great idea.  The execution of the show, that is a different story entirely.The one of the many draw backs of the show is Courteney Cox.  Mind you her acting isn't bad, but it seems like she is trying SO hard to escape the paradigm she created on Friends for the past decade that she comes off kind of flat.  She plays Lucy Spiller, like the play on the text ""Spiller = spill the beans/dirt"".  Lucy is the type A personality, anal and OCD cut throat director of DirtNow magazine.  She wants her story hell or high water.  Nothing or anyone will stand in her way.  Lucy also has trust issues mainly with men; this is due to trauma that happened with her father.  These types of trust issues also mirror her intimacy issues. Nevertheless, Lucy finds plenty of time to masturbate, which I found boring after awhile, and that is saying a lot.  A word to the wise, Lucy will sell out ANYBODY AND EVERYBODY for a story.  In other words she is a real ""another name for a female dog"".  As for Courteney Cox, I find her to be a very attractive woman, yet in this show her face looked really hard and shopworn.  I also wanted to feed her a couple of things of the 99 cent menu from Wendy's, she is way too skinny.Now it seems like Lucy might have some soft spots or things that might make her a likeable character, but it never happened.  She is so obsessed with getting a story that she will black mailing and stepping on toes to get it.  However that behavior after about four episodes grows frail.  I got to the point where I didn't even care what happened to her.  This is a bad sign when she is the lead character and is carrying the show.  There was no duplicity with Lucy, in other words she isn't very dynamic. I find this surprising for a FX show, because many characters from their shows display wonderful binary components (i.e. Tommy Gavin from Rescue Me & Christian Troy from Nip/Tuck).  There was also a subplot in the first season where someone was black mailing Lucy.  First of all Lucy was so vexing I really didn't care if someone was out to get her.  Oh and as a side note, I figured out who was black mailing her half way through the season, it was painfully obvious, really.  Also in juxtaposition of this mystery of ""Who is black mailing Lucy"" FX put a contest out: guess who is black mailing her and e-mail your suspect and you can win a new car.  Again this contest happened half way through the first season.  Were the ratings for this show so poor that FX had to give a car away so people would keep watching?As for the rest of the characters, well they are all pretty much empty.  Everyone is either out for their best interests and rather shallow in their ruses in achieving this goal.  The only really interesting character in the entire show is Don played by the talented Ian Hart.  Don is a photographer who is both astute in taking pictures and is paranoid schizophrenic.  Also every single character in this show abuses a controlled substance one time or another.  I suppose it is good to throw in some drug/alcohol addiction, but come on.  As for the movie star Julia, she is a pill popper and we follow her in and out of rehab.  The realism of her addiction and treatment was written very poorly.  She was a waste of a character.  Willa, reporter for DirtNow is basically morphed every week, from modest, surly, eager, slut, moral and backstabber.  Brent, publisher for DirtNow wasn't as annoying as other characters, but appeared to break every law possible in the world of sexual harassment. Even guest stars like Vincent Gallo and Paul ""Pee-Wee Herman"" Reubens didn't add any solace or redeeming aspects.There were also plenty of loop hopes and/or dead ends throughout the season that never went anywhere and/or just ended quickly.  For instance, Holt (who appears high or half asleep the entire season), who is Julia's boyfriend and famous movie star, but then gets involved with Lucy despite the fact Lucy never seemed attracted to him, throws up worms, yes I said it, throws up worms, like earthworms.  What medical condition makes you puke up worms and not be dancing outside death's door?  I can swallow (pun intended) the worm thing if Holt was bitten by a zombie, turning into a werewolf or something.  However, it appears that this happens just to shock the viewer.  Once the shock is given, the storyline is never revisited.  The entire season is like this.  Many issues that surround former L.A. Laker Rick Fox's character in this show follow the same formula.  As for Jennifer Aniston's guest appearance in the last show of the season, give me a break.  This show pretty much became a parody of itself; showcase Aniston so this is the first time that Aniston and Cox had been on camera again since Friends.  If this isn't a media/tabloid scam then I don't know what is.As for the storylines from week to week, it seems like the writers followed one of two methods when producing their daft tales.  The first involves the writers picking up an abnormal psychology text book and opening up a random page.  Whatever page they landed on is what issues/disorder/personality trait they will focus on that week.  The second involves a contest between the writers, to see if they can make this week's show as different as possible from the one the prior week.  The only conduit is the characters, but the story and even the behaviors of the characters don't really follow over from last week's show.I don't want to be misunderstood, I love sex, even graphic sex, violence, sordid affairs, deception and really dark subject matter.  Dirt had all of these things, but with flat characters and the only real conflict in story was that Lucy needed a cover story (every show focused on that) and everything else just got old really fast.  In addition, Dirt might be candid in it's depiction of Hollywood and how the media covers it.  Yet if I want to watch superficial stuff about celebrities I will just watch E News or Entertainment Tonight.  If I want sex or violence thrown into the mix, I will watch either of the former shows then watch an adult movie and a Chuck Norris flick.I do feel I gave Dirt a solid chance since I stuck in there for the entire first season.  I do admit it provided entertainment in the ""it is so bad it is funny and I am enjoying abasing it"" sort of way.  Dirt is rather lackluster, listless and humdrum when compared to some of the other shows FX produces.  I guess Dirt did something right because from what I understand it is coming back for a second season.  For the sake of content, I hope Dirt takes a different approach its second season, because at the current moment daytime soap operas and low budget movies have more substance.",1,The name of the show

Courtney Cox is fantastic as a character in charge of a half-dirty tabloid, half-entertainment news type of magazine.  She is constantly battling with celebrities to get new ""dirt"" that no other magazine has, and is very good at playing the politics needed to make it in the business.There is plenty of sexual inuendo (and more) for those looking for that, and great relationships between characters that are constantly evolving.
