The acting isn't bad, a bit stiff maybe.  My main problem with the movie is the premise.Replicating an enigma machine in digital hardware seems so blindly ignorant.  Even the most rudimentary software solution would work better.  But, of course the hardware is just a MacGuffin to move the plot forward.  Except that the plot seems little more than an excuse to preach about the &#34;Evil Empire&#34; and expose and denigrate women.  And the &#34;twist&#34; if you can call it that, is an attack on the &#34;Good guys,&#34; that just serves to further confuse and insult the intelligence of the audience.  The redeeming moment near the end of the movie almost saves this picture.  I don't want to spoil it entirely, but it doesn't quite succeed in redeeming either the protagonists or antagonist.

949853,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,B000BTITXA,Dr. James Gardner,"[1, 6]","""Engima"" is a 1983 black and white spy thriller starring Martin Sheen, Sam Neill, and  Brigette Fossey. It was directed by French director Jeannot Szwarc.Martin Sheen was hot in 1983. He had been nominated for an Emmy for his performances in ""The Execution of Private Slovak"" (1974) and ""Taxi!!"" (1978) and for a Golden Globe in ""The Subject was Roses"" (1968) and ""Blind Ambition"" (1979). ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979) had been a huge hit and the TV mini series ""Kennedy"" in which he played the President was ongoing.French director Jeannot Szwarc  started in TV in the late 60s then turned to films with ""Jaws 2"" (1978) and ""Somewhere in Time"" (1980). ""Engima"" was his next film, but before long he returned to TV where he has worked exclusively . Szwarc said he was trying to create a film as good as ""The Third Man"" (1949).What we don't have is another ""Third Man"". The acting is mediocre, the action is extremely slow, and the photography is dull. The story is OK and there are some good twists and turns, but overall it is disappointing. The NY Times said ""this is the spy film at its most absurdly hard-boiled and at its most icily perfunctory"".When you think of great spy films, circa 1980, the ones that come to mind are Hitchcock's ""North By Northwest"" (1969),  ""The Lady Vanishes"" (1938), and ""Notorious"" (1946), Richard Burton's ""The Spy Who Came in from the Cold"" (1965), and ""Three Days of the Condor"" (1975).

949854,A2VJ80PM1G00QV,B000BTITXA,drkhimxz,"[5, 6]","With a mix of total cynicism and idealism, this is a late Cold War thriller which will provide you with the necessary elements of suspense, fear for the fate of the ""Good Guys"" and loathing for the ""Bad Guys"" with a novel twist. There are elements which weaken the impact as compared to the best of breed in this genre, but still it should grip most who do not demand only the superior. Martin Sheen and Sam Neill fulfill the demands of the script, which is a bit high in its requirement that one accepts the unlikely, particularly in the case of Neill's character; Brigitte Fossey is appealing in her heroines role. Derek Jacobi is wasted in a caricatured role as an East German security agent but the other supporting players do not induce the same sense of waste in fulfilling the stereotypes they play.
