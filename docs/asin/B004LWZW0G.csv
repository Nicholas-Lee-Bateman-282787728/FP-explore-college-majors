1414408,A1LBIZLET9CW1I,B004LWZW0G,A fellow with a keyboard,"[18, 21]","This is a complicated film to rate. I give the filmmakers 4.7 stars for production, 1.3 stars for the intended message, and 5 stars for the unintended message they left me with.Re: production, the director/production team unearthed some wonderful old footage and tied it in with the new footage elegantly and even powerfully. They picked interviewees who were colorful, both literally and figuratively. They tied strings of narrative through the documentary in order to make it less like a dry profile. And most impressively, they knew what to leave out: they didn't show Bill Cunningham living in his new apartment, and they didn't show Bill Cunningham at church. Those would have been obvious things to do, but they didn't do it, and I applaud them for that.But in terms of thoughtfulness, in terms of helping us understand why any of this matters, the filmmakers left something to be desired. If the film had ended after the first 60 minutes, I would have given it exactly 1 star. That's because in the first 60 minutes, interspersed between interviews with ultra-status-conscious people who were out to convince the world (and themselves) that they were unique little flowers, the filmmakers were giving us little nuggets of junior varsity wisdom. They were appealing to our inner-adolescent with lessons like ""follow your passion"" and ""express yourself"" and ""be nice to each other.""The final 24 minutes, though, were very interesting, much less adolescent-y, and, at times, moving. We start to get glimpses of how this is more than an obsession for Bill, how it is all-absorbing to the exclusion of all else (including romantic relationships), and we start to get glimpses (albeit somewhat unconvincing ones) of why it matters to him:* ""The wider world that perceives fashion as a frivolity that should be done away with in the face of social upheavals and problems that are enormous-- the point is, in fact, that fashion is the armor to survive the reality of everyday life.""* ""I don't think you could do away with fashion. It would be like doing away with civilization.""* ""I just like fashion as an art form of dressing the body. If we all went out looking like a slob like me, it would be a pretty dreary world.""* ""I'm not interested in celebrities. The cut, the lines, the colors... that's everything.""* ""It's not work. I'm just having fun.""There is something about the philosophical nature of these quotes or the way he expressed them that made them not 100% convincing. They seemed more like rationalizations than reasons. But then, in a speech he gives at a ceremony in Paris, we finally get the real reason, and we know it is the real reason because he can't contain his emotions.""It's as true today as it ever was--he who seeks beauty will find it.""It's a touching moment and one that defines the film. Or ought to have defined the film. Every decision about what to include or exclude in this film ought to have been based on that single line.And that's where the filmmakers fall short. For them, the climax of the film is a different moment, the one where they try to penetrate his private life, asking about his sexuality and his religion. They are just trying to deliver the juice, the gossipy details that we all desire to know. But they do not ask the much more important questions:* If it's beauty he's seeking, why doesn't he find it elsewhere, in music or food or any aesthetic other than clothing? In particular, why doesn't he find it in people (rather than just on their clothes or their bodies)?* Why is he so unreflective w/r/t his one-dimensionality? When asked if he has any regrets about not having romantic relationships, his response was along the lines of ""no, I never had the time to consider it."" Really, Bill? Never while you were out riding your bike? Never while you were in a dark room processing your film did you wonder whether there wasn't more to life than what you were doing?The filmmakers paint Bill Cunningham as a wise, loveable, almost martyr-like figure, someone who devoted his life to his passion. An American hero. Bill Cunningham is more complicated than that. He's a man who has been greatly influenced by Catholicism - you can see it in his morality, his relentless work, his asceticism, and his concern for aesthetics - but his asceticism has seeped into his aesthetics so that he seeks beauty in only one form. The filmmakers are right about the admirable and honorable parts of Bill Cunningham, but they miss (or don't pay enough attention to) the other parts.---Update 11/23: I was reminded of this movie over and over again while watchingSearching for Sugar Man.",3,"""It's as true today as it ever was--he who seeks beauty will find it.""",1340496000,"06 24, 2012",2012,4624,"['complicated', 'film', 'rate', 'give', 'filmmakers', '4.7', 'stars', 'production', '1.3', 'stars', 'intended', 'message', '5', 'stars', 'unintended', 'message', 'left', 'with.Re', 'production', 'director/production', 'team', 'unearthed', 'wonderful', 'old', 'footage', 'tied', 'new', 'footage', 'elegantly', 'even', 'powerfully', 'picked', 'interviewees', 'who', 'were', 'colorful', 'literally', 'figuratively', 'tied', 'strings', 'narrative', 'documentary', 'order', 'make', 'less', 'dry', 'profile', 'most', 'impressively', 'knew', 'what', 'leave', 'out', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'Bill', 'Cunningham', 'living', 'new', 'apartment', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'Bill', 'Cunningham', 'church', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'obvious', 'things', 'do', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'applaud', 'that.But', 'terms', 'thoughtfulness', 'terms', 'helping', 'understand', 'why', 'matters', 'filmmakers', 'left', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'film', 'had', 'ended', 'first', '60', 'minutes', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'exactly', '1', 'star', 'because', 'first', '60', 'minutes', 'interspersed', 'interviews', 'ultra-status-conscious', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'out', 'convince', 'world', 'were', 'unique', 'little', 'flowers', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'giving', 'little', 'nuggets', 'junior', 'varsity', 'wisdom', 'were', 'appealing', 'inner-adolescent', 'lessons', 'follow', 'passion', 'express', 'be', 'nice', 'other', 'final', '24', 'minutes', 'though', 'were', 'very', 'interesting', 'much', 'less', 'adolescent-y', 'times', 'moving', 'start', 'get', 'glimpses', 'how', 'more', 'obsession', 'Bill', 'how', 'all-absorbing', 'exclusion', 'else', 'including', 'romantic', 'relationships', 'start', 'get', 'glimpses', 'somewhat', 'unconvincing', 'ones', 'why', '*', 'wider', 'world', 'fashion', 'frivolity', 'should', 'be', 'done', 'away', 'face', 'social', 'upheavals', 'problems', 'are', 'enormous', 'point', 'fact', 'fashion', 'armor', 'survive', 'reality', 'everyday', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'could', 'do', 'away', 'fashion', 'would', 'be', 'doing', 'away', 'civilization', 'just', 'like', 'fashion', 'art', 'form', 'dressing', 'body', 'went', 'out', 'looking', 'slob', 'would', 'be', 'pretty', 'dreary', 'world', ""'m"", 'not', 'interested', 'celebrities', 'cut', 'lines', 'colors', 'everything', 'not', 'work', ""'m"", 'just', 'having', 'fun', 'something', 'philosophical', 'nature', 'quotes', 'way', 'expressed', 'made', 'not', '100', '%', 'convincing', 'seemed', 'more', 'rationalizations', 'reasons', 'then', 'speech', 'ceremony', 'Paris', 'finally', 'get', 'real', 'reason', 'know', 'real', 'reason', 'ca', ""n't"", 'contain', 'emotions', 'true', 'today', 'ever', 'was', 'who', 'beauty', 'will', 'find', 'touching', 'moment', 'one', 'film', 'ought', 'have', 'defined', 'film', 'decision', 'what', 'include', 'exclude', 'film', 'ought', 'have', 'been', 'based', 'single', 'line.And', 'where', 'filmmakers', 'fall', 'short', 'climax', 'film', 'different', 'moment', 'one', 'where', 'try', 'penetrate', 'private', 'life', 'asking', 'sexuality', 'religion', 'are', 'just', 'trying', 'deliver', 'juice', 'gossipy', 'details', 'desire', 'know', 'do', 'not', 'ask', 'much', 'more', 'important', 'questions', '*', 'beauty', 'seeking', 'why', ""n't"", 'find', 'elsewhere', 'music', 'food', 'aesthetic', 'other', 'clothing', 'particular', 'why', ""n't"", 'find', 'people', 'rather', 'just', 'clothes', 'bodies', '*', 'Why', 'so', 'unreflective', 'one-dimensionality', 'When', 'asked', 'regrets', 'not', 'having', 'romantic', 'relationships', 'response', 'was', 'lines', 'never', 'had', 'time', 'consider', 'Really', 'Bill', 'Never', 'were', 'out', 'riding', 'bike', 'Never', 'were', 'dark', 'room', 'processing', 'film', 'did', 'wonder', 'was', ""n't"", 'more', 'life', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'filmmakers', 'paint', 'Bill', 'Cunningham', 'wise', 'loveable', 'almost', 'martyr-like', 'figure', 'someone', 'who', 'devoted', 'life', 'passion', 'American', 'hero', 'Bill', 'Cunningham', 'more', 'complicated', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'greatly', 'influenced', 'Catholicism', 'can', 'see', 'morality', 'relentless', 'work', 'asceticism', 'concern', 'aesthetics', 'asceticism', 'seeped', 'aesthetics', 'so', 'beauty', 'only', 'one', 'form', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'right', 'admirable', 'honorable', 'parts', 'Bill', 'Cunningham', 'miss', 'do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'enough', 'attention', 'other', 'parts.', '-Update', '11/23', 'was', 'reminded', 'movie', 'over', 'again', 'watchingSearching', 'Sugar', 'Man']",Bill Cunningham New York
1414409,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B004LWZW0G,Andy Orrock,"[1, 1]","If you love good documentaries on the fashion industry -The September IssueandValentino: The Last Emperorfor example - you'll love 'Bill Cunningham New York.'  But even if fashion doesn't interest you, if you love New York City - either as resident or frequent visitor - you'll love BCNY.  And, even if you don't think or care much about NYC, you'll be fascinated by this insider's look at this one-of-a-kind, impassably dedicated, deceptively complex man.  How this film from Richard Press didn't get an Academy Award nomination  is beyond me.  [Oh, right: Harvey Weinstein didn't back it.]For dedicated readers of the New York Times, there's the thrill of finding out what goes into compiling and editing Cunningham's iconic ""On the Street"" pictorial montage each week.  A few viewers might find that look into the editing process tedious.  But I suspect most will find it fascinating.  We see Mr. Cunningham pick a theme and then work through the week at assembling his vision with John Kurdewan, a production artist and layout editor for the Times.  I loved the film's focus on the work and relationship between these two: Kurdewan's technical chops (and extraordinary patience, good humor...and a bit of mock exasperation!) together with Mr. Cunningham's artistic vision (and trademark doggedness - into his 80s now, he still obsesses over the finest detail).If there's a single word to sum up Mr. Cunningham, it is ""unimpeachable.""  We see this characteristic most clearly demonstrated in his approach to his other signature column: Evening Hours.  He is pounded with hordes of invitations.  He flips through a stack on his desk.  Yet, he only picks the events that he deems worthy.  Throughout his entire career, he's never taken a single cent (other than his Times salary) to cover these events.  It's plainer than that: he's never taken so much as a sip of water at these events.  This isn't a casual decision.  Mr. Cunningham makes it clear that in taking this line, he maintains his freedom.  At his most serious, he intones, ""Never take the money."" Riveting stuff.My favorite scene among many: Cunningham in Paris attempting to get into an important show.  Were you not to know the man, you'd probably have the reaction that the gatekeeper does: Cunningham continually flashes his pass, continually gets overlooked.  He never pulls rank.  He never pulls the ""Do you know who I am?"" card.  Throughout, Press keeps his camera trained at a distance.  Cunningham is either unaware or doesn't care.  Finally, another person affiliated with the show intervenes, pushes the clueless security personnel away with these words: ""Please, he's the most important man in the world.""That Cunningham is indeed that man (in this world) and remains his singular, ascetic self makes this the most fascinating of tales.  I'm so glad that Richard Press captured the story before Cunningham's unique career comes to a close.",5,"""Please, he's the most important man in the world""",1331596800,"03 13, 2012",2012,2915,"['love', 'good', 'documentaries', 'fashion', 'industry', '-The', 'September', 'IssueandValentino', 'Last', 'Emperorfor', 'example', ""'ll"", 'love', ""'Bill"", 'Cunningham', 'New', 'York', 'even', 'fashion', ""n't"", 'interest', 'love', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'resident', 'frequent', 'visitor', ""'ll"", 'love', 'BCNY', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'care', 'much', 'NYC', ""'ll"", 'be', 'fascinated', 'insider', 'look', 'one-of-a-kind', 'impassably', 'dedicated', 'deceptively', 'complex', 'man', 'How', 'film', 'Richard', 'Press', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', '[', 'Oh', 'right', 'Harvey', 'Weinstein', 'did', ""n't"", 'back', ']', 'dedicated', 'readers', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'thrill', 'finding', 'out', 'what', 'compiling', 'editing', 'Cunningham', 'iconic', 'Street', 'pictorial', 'montage', 'week', 'few', 'viewers', 'might', 'find', 'look', 'editing', 'process', 'tedious', 'suspect', 'most', 'will', 'find', 'fascinating', 'see', 'Mr.', 'Cunningham', 'theme', 'then', 'work', 'week', 'assembling', 'vision', 'John', 'Kurdewan', 'production', 'artist', 'layout', 'editor', 'Times', 'loved', 'film', 'focus', 'work', 'relationship', 'two', 'Kurdewan', 'technical', 'chops', 'extraordinary', 'patience', 'good', 'humor', 'bit', 'mock', 'exasperation', 'together', 'Mr.', 'Cunningham', 'artistic', 'vision', 'trademark', 'doggedness', '80s', 'now', 'still', 'finest', 'detail', '.If', 'single', 'word', 'sum', 'up', 'Mr.', 'Cunningham', 'unimpeachable', 'see', 'characteristic', 'most', 'clearly', 'demonstrated', 'approach', 'other', 'signature', 'column', 'Evening', 'Hours', 'pounded', 'hordes', 'invitations', 'stack', 'desk', 'Yet', 'only', 'events', 'worthy', 'entire', 'career', 'never', 'taken', 'single', 'cent', 'other', 'Times', 'salary', 'cover', 'events', 'plainer', 'never', 'taken', 'so', 'much', 'sip', 'water', 'events', ""n't"", 'casual', 'decision', 'Mr.', 'Cunningham', 'clear', 'taking', 'line', 'freedom', 'most', 'serious', 'Never', 'take', 'money', 'Riveting', 'stuff.My', 'favorite', 'scene', 'many', 'Cunningham', 'Paris', 'attempting', 'get', 'important', 'show', 'Were', 'not', 'know', 'man', ""'d"", 'probably', 'have', 'reaction', 'gatekeeper', 'Cunningham', 'continually', 'pass', 'continually', 'overlooked', 'never', 'rank', 'never', 'Do', 'know', 'who', 'am', 'card', 'Throughout', 'Press', 'camera', 'trained', 'distance', 'Cunningham', 'unaware', ""n't"", 'care', 'Finally', 'person', 'affiliated', 'show', 'intervenes', 'clueless', 'security', 'personnel', 'away', 'words', 'Please', 'most', 'important', 'man', 'world', 'Cunningham', 'indeed', 'man', 'world', 'singular', 'ascetic', 'self', 'most', 'fascinating', 'tales', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'Richard', 'Press', 'captured', 'story', 'Cunningham', 'unique', 'career', 'close']",Bill Cunningham New York

At first it seemed puzzling why anyone would make a documentary about an old guy who works for the New York Times riding a bicycle around and photographing street fashions. But I quickly got drawn into the film and understood how the filmakers had chosen this unusual man.Bill Cunningham, now in his 80's, has worked for many years as a street photographer, riding precariously around Manhatten on his bicycle and snapping (film) photos of what people are wearing. In an age when there is so much corruption in all walks of life, what comes out in the film is Cunningham's unique sense of personal integrity. In a city obsessed with status, he seems to care nothing for status or celebrity or personalities; he is only interested in the clothes, the ideas. When he attends society and fashion functions in the evening, which he does almost every evening, he declines to accept food or drink; it would compromise his ethics. Indeed here is a man who has no apparent vices and minimal personal life. He lives frugally. He strives to be honest. He strives to do no harm. He cares little for his comfort. He has simply made a life of observing how people in New York express themselves through fashion; it is enough for him. ""I have tried to play a straight game"" he says about his life.One might not be surprised to hear that a medieval monk or pure mathematician or a scholar of ancient languages had such an ascetic and, one may say, spiritually refined existence, but in the New York fashion world! And so he is a beloved fixture in New York.

I care little for fashion but I know a wonderful person when I see one, and it's a treat to hang out with Bill for these 85 minutes.I had just watched the Joan Rivers doc before this, and what an incredible contrast in New Yorkers. Her total self-absorption and selfishness is the polar opposite to Bill's amazingly pure spirit. This guy could be loaded from selling his stuff, but instead lives an almost ascetic life in an apartment 95% full of his work, and fine work it is. He denigrates his photography technically, but he captures feelings as well as he does clothes, and his shots have real life and spark. The man is an artist.And what a human being! I was most of all impressed by his riding a simple cruiser bike around Manhattan almost 24/7. They make it seem basic here, but man, that's no mean feat. Plus he eschews all the perqs of his lifestyle, the food and booze and all else that's right at his fingertips. The guy just loves to shoot quirky, strong, elegant clothes and people, and few do it better.This is an absolutely delightful film, not only becasue we get to share Bill's daily delight in leading the life he's chosen, but for the reminder that the best and happiest lives certainly don't need to be ""normal"". Bill has no family (except everyone in New York, it seems) and has never had a lover, he reveals; his breakdown talking about religion is interesting, as he clearly he gets what he needs from his spiritual life, and more power to him. His joy speaks for itself.All in all, a real treat and one of the most pleasant films I've seen in a long while.

The brilliance is in the editing, so that we gradually move from an outside perspective to a sense of what might be driving this extraordinary individual. A written description might give the impression that he is perhaps slightly autistic but, watching him interact, you realise he is a highly focused and driven person, with a good nature, joyful disposition and wonderful sense of ethics that is doubly wonderful because it is never imposed on others.For me the two key take-outs were firstly, a celebration of New York and Paris, the two great cities that most embrace liberty. Thinking of my own hometown Melbourne Australia and its tut-tut brigade and rigorous policing, Bill could never pull this off here. I mean, you can't even ride a bicycle without a helmet. He'd have been arrested thousands of times for photographing, jay-walking or weaving in and out of traffic. And the people he films - those individuals who define ""the edge"" in all its glorious variety - again the movie enables us to develop a vivid sense of New York's vibrant imagination. Liberty - such a celebration!The second point is perhaps more striking. This movie is much like the wonderful ""Into The Wild"" from a few years ago in that both chart a the true story of a man who completely forsakes the materialistic life and in the process achieves near-total freedom. The remarkable thing about Bill is that he manages to pull it off while living in the midst of a highly individualistic, hedonistic, materialistic environment. He is vigorously engaged with it but seemingly unaffected; he never seems to criticise, his photographs are invariably kind. And he takes ""conflict of interest"" to a whole new level; the movie undoubtedly will challenge the comfortable assumptions we all make. While ""Into The Wild"" charts a young man's journey into an unmaterialistic life, in ""Bill Cunningham New York"" he reached there many decades ago and we are left to wonder about his journey.

""Bill Cunningham New York"" is about someone who has been doing what he likes best for more than forty years with unstoppable energy and firm belief. The film is not just about fashion; it is also the passion for what we believe in.The film chronicles the daily life and work of a New York Times photographer Bill Cunningham (born in 1929). Every day, rain or shine, he takes pictures of the passers-by in New York - to be precise, their street fashion like clothes, hats and shoes. Whether the wearer is a celebrity or not does not matter. He only takes photos of what he likes.There is something strangely infectious about his personality. The way Bill talks about what he does, takes photos on the streets and rides his bicycle through Manhattan (and bumping into a taxi ... yes he does) in itself is as fascinating as the street fashion he captures with his camera. According to Bill, ""My dear, it's not work, it's pleasure.""Most of the interviewees including Vogue editor Anna Wintour have interesting things to say, but even without them the film would have been a delightful and intriguing one with nice and happy Bill Cunningham. There are some amusing moments that look like scenes directly out of Woody Allen comedies (like Bill taking photos at his own event).

1414432,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B004LWZW0G,Turfseer,"[3, 5]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Nominated for a Spirit Award for Best Documentary, 'Bill Cunningham New York' is an entertaining and enjoyable film about a fascinating eccentric who no doubt belongs in the pantheon of all-time great NYC characters. 'Bill' initially worked as a fashion columnist but has now been at the NY Times for many years primarily as both a roving photographer and fashion maven/columnist.'Bill' is now in his early eighties, and has been seen bicycling around the city for years. Director Richard Press found some footage at the NY Times, from over twenty years ago, which featured Cunningham talking about his work, and he hasn't changed a bit. Bill lived for years in a very small apartment above Carnegie Hall where he kept all his negatives and photos. There are some interviews with some of his neighbors and friends, extraordinary in their own right.What's great about Bill is that he is full of energy and loves his work. His main thing is photographing people (mainly women) who are dressed in a way that impresses him. Bill only photographs those who he's drawn to--he appears to be an excellent critic when it comes to fashion. Even though he often covers big society events for the NY Times, he's never drawn to the cult of celebrity.Despite his great talents, Bill is completely modest in his personal life. He hardly has any clothes and seems to delight in wearing the same windbreaker wherever he goes. He has no interest in food per se and basically indicates that he's asexual. Bill becomes emotional only when he discusses his devotion to his Roman Catholic faith (attending church every Sunday appears to provide him with an 'anchor' as otherwise, he is constantly 'on the run').There is no doubt that Bill Cunningham is a beloved character. This is evidenced by the birthday party thrown for him by NY Times staff as well an award given to him in Paris as a man of letters. You'll also get a peek at how his columns at the Times are put together, with the able assistance of a production assistant.You don't really have to be interested in fashion to appreciate Bill Cunningham New York.
