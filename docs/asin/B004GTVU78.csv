1407331,A2C5VLIJMDPWHI,B004GTVU78,"Shamontiel L. Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[0, 0]","I like comedians who make intelligent commentary and talk about politics. Problem is unlike Wanda Sykes and Chris Rock, Eddie Griffin speculated on stuff that changed in time (ex. soldiers in Iraq). Now those statements are outdated. As far as the ""puppet strings"" comment, when someone is not running anything and on puppet strings, they don't have a new party created to oppose him, somebody screaming ""liar"" in a POTUS address and don't upset the right so bad that they say ""no"" to almost everything. When you're on a puppet string, you tend to do what someone TELLS you to do. I'm reading comments about him dropping all this science and saying these intelligent things, but just because somebody said something with authority doesn't make it fact. CNN is considered b.s., but THIS is the truth? Meanwhile, while we're hearing lectures about reading and avoiding stereotypes, he's embracing the n-word (CONSTANTLY said it), drinking liquor and cigarettes nonstop (yeah, I know he said he doesn't want to be a good-looking corpse), and screaming about how he wants to have sex with First Lady Michelle Obama (I get that that was supposed to be a joke, but man, that was extra tacky).Now with that said, he did have some points I was impressed with. His conversation about gangs, representing yourself and the background of the Crips and the Bloods was interesting. Didn't know it and I immediately looked it up to see if this information was true. I totally respect that. I applaud him for encouraging folks to think and read. I can even get with the few lines of other languages he memorized.I think the ""white"" jokes went on a bit too long (although he was right about white guys dating some incredibly attractive black women). I'm not at all bothered by the religious jokes, but I'm pretty sure he offended someone in the crowd considering how heavily religious ""we"" are (I'm agnostic). I could've done without the b-word and the n-word.I thought he was a trooper to sing happy birthday to the lady in the crowd although I think it's hella obnoxious to start yelling out special requests during someone else's routine. It also made me far more uncomfortable with the language he was using after I saw the woman whose birthday it was. I could've gone without the whole birthday scene BUT I liked the part when he talked about respecting your elders because they helped you get to where you are now. Only problem was then he went right back to some super disrespectful language. Then again, the mom had to know what she was getting into so I guess she was all right with it. Audience members, please stop yelling out in the crowd. Do that at home.The performance was cool, but every time he said something smart he'd proceed to either say or do something idiotic (like get arrested for a DUI more than once) so I was a little confused about it. Not sure if I enjoyed it or didn't enjoy it, but I did like PARTS of it. I think he could be so much better if he calmed down a little on [n-word] rhymes-with-spit to keep his act going. I sure do hope we don't lose him to cancer from all the smoking and drinking he did just in that hour and a half onstage.",3,"Good in parts, lacking in others",1329609600,"02 19, 2012",2012,3157,"['like', 'comedians', 'who', 'make', 'intelligent', 'commentary', 'talk', 'politics', 'Problem', 'Wanda', 'Sykes', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'Eddie', 'Griffin', 'speculated', 'stuff', 'changed', 'time', 'ex', 'soldiers', 'Iraq', 'Now', 'statements', 'are', 'outdated', 'As', 'far', 'puppet', 'strings', 'comment', 'when', 'someone', 'not', 'running', 'anything', 'puppet', 'strings', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'new', 'party', 'created', 'oppose', 'somebody', 'screaming', 'liar', 'POTUS', 'address', 'do', ""n't"", 'upset', 'right', 'so', 'bad', 'say', 'almost', 'everything', 'When', ""'re"", 'puppet', 'string', 'tend', 'do', 'what', 'someone', 'TELLS', 'do', ""'m"", 'reading', 'comments', 'dropping', 'science', 'saying', 'intelligent', 'things', 'just', 'somebody', 'said', 'something', 'authority', ""n't"", 'make', 'fact', 'CNN', 'considered', 'b.s.', 'THIS', 'truth', 'Meanwhile', ""'re"", 'hearing', 'lectures', 'reading', 'avoiding', 'stereotypes', 'embracing', 'n-word', 'CONSTANTLY', 'said', 'drinking', 'liquor', 'cigarettes', 'nonstop', 'yeah', 'know', 'said', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'good-looking', 'corpse', 'screaming', 'how', 'have', 'sex', 'First', 'Lady', 'Michelle', 'Obama', 'get', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'joke', 'man', 'was', 'extra', 'tacky', '.Now', 'said', 'did', 'have', 'points', 'was', 'impressed', 'conversation', 'gangs', 'representing', 'background', 'Crips', 'Bloods', 'was', 'interesting', 'Did', ""n't"", 'know', 'immediately', 'looked', 'up', 'see', 'information', 'was', 'true', 'totally', 'respect', 'applaud', 'encouraging', 'folks', 'think', 'read', 'can', 'even', 'get', 'few', 'lines', 'other', 'languages', 'think', 'white', 'jokes', 'went', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'was', 'right', 'white', 'guys', 'dating', 'incredibly', 'attractive', 'black', 'women', ""'m"", 'not', 'bothered', 'religious', 'jokes', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'offended', 'someone', 'crowd', 'considering', 'how', 'heavily', 'religious', 'are', ""'m"", 'agnostic', 'could', ""'ve"", 'done', 'b-word', 'n-word.I', 'thought', 'was', 'trooper', 'sing', 'happy', 'birthday', 'lady', 'crowd', 'think', 'hella', 'obnoxious', 'start', 'yelling', 'out', 'special', 'requests', 'someone', 'else', 'routine', 'also', 'made', 'far', 'more', 'uncomfortable', 'language', 'was', 'using', 'saw', 'woman', 'birthday', 'was', 'could', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'whole', 'birthday', 'scene', 'BUT', 'liked', 'part', 'when', 'talked', 'respecting', 'elders', 'helped', 'get', 'where', 'are', 'now', 'Only', 'problem', 'was', 'then', 'went', 'right', 'back', 'super', 'disrespectful', 'language', 'Then', 'again', 'mom', 'had', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'getting', 'so', 'guess', 'was', 'right', 'Audience', 'members', 'please', 'stop', 'yelling', 'out', 'crowd', 'Do', 'home.The', 'performance', 'was', 'cool', 'time', 'said', 'something', 'smart', ""'d"", 'proceed', 'say', 'do', 'something', 'idiotic', 'get', 'arrested', 'DUI', 'more', 'once', 'was', 'little', 'confused', 'Not', 'sure', 'enjoyed', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'did', 'PARTS', 'think', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'calmed', 'down', 'little', '[', 'n-word', ']', 'rhymes-with-spit', 'keep', 'act', 'going', 'sure', 'do', 'hope', 'do', ""n't"", 'lose', 'cancer', 'smoking', 'drinking', 'did', 'just', 'hour', 'half', 'onstage']",Eddie Griffin: You Can Tell 'Em I Said It
