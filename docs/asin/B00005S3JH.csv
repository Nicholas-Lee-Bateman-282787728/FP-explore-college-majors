The purpose of the movie is to look closely at Michel Descombes, the father. The Clockmaker (l'Horloger de Saint-Paul) is not a murder mystery. Were it not for the skills of Bertrand Tavernier and his frequent lead actor, Philippe Noiret, we might be in for a long, introspective slog full of what it means to be a solitary human being. With these two, and with Jean Rochefort as Inspector Guilboud, we have a movie that explores loneliness, friendship and, eventually, understanding with a good deal of depth and style.Descombes is a self-contained man, friendly enough, probably what he thought of as a reasonably good parent, but not an especially happy man. ""You're a widower?"" a policeman asks. ""No, not exactly,"" he says. ""We were already separated. I guess I am a widower. I was just as miserable as one."" Descombes struggles to understand his young son. Inspector Guilboud struggles to understand the son's motive, and then to understand the father. The more they learn, however, the more the fact of the matter stays the same; the son murdered a man. ""I killed him because he was filth,"" Bernard Descombes eventually declares. Guilboud finds some empathy with Descombes. Even so, Descombes' son will be caught. ""France is a funny country,"" Guilboud says. ""Fifty-million inhabitants, twenty million informants."" Descombes' son seems to represent more than just another murderer to Guilboud, a man with his own issues. He may see something of himself in Descombes. It is Descombes, however, who has to make the hardest journey, to try to understand who his son is.The Clockmaker turns out to be one of the most interesting of the collaborations between Tavernier and Noiret, even with the now dull political subtext of complacent and suffocating French society. Still, the movie was made in 1974, an uneasy period. The movie finds itself, however, and the last twenty minutes are powerful minutes. ""I stand by my son...in complete solidarity."" Without Noiret, this movie would not have worked at all well, in my opinion. With Noiret and Rochefort, it works very well.Other films by Tavernier and starring Noiret that I recommend with enthusiasm includeCoup de Torchon - Criterion Collection(a marvelous black comedy),Revenge of the MusketeersandLife and Nothing But.The DVD transfer by Kino is inexcusably poor, with a cropped, fuzzy, dark picture and poor color hues. The subtitles are yellow with black edging and are easy to read. There are no extras.",4,"The combination of Philippe Noiret and Bertrand Tavernier, this time with Jean Rochefort, make for a movie worth watching",1221264000,"09 13, 2008",2008,2544,"['son', 'killed', 'man', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'cause', 'movie', 'murder', 'purpose', 'movie', 'look', 'closely', 'Michel', 'Descombes', 'father', 'Clockmaker', ""l'Horloger"", 'Saint-Paul', 'not', 'murder', 'mystery', 'Were', 'not', 'skills', 'Bertrand', 'Tavernier', 'frequent', 'lead', 'actor', 'Philippe', 'Noiret', 'might', 'be', 'long', 'introspective', 'slog', 'full', 'what', 'be', 'solitary', 'human', 'being', 'two', 'Jean', 'Rochefort', 'Inspector', 'Guilboud', 'have', 'movie', 'loneliness', 'friendship', 'eventually', 'understanding', 'good', 'deal', 'depth', 'style.Descombes', 'self-contained', 'man', 'friendly', 'enough', 'probably', 'what', 'thought', 'reasonably', 'good', 'parent', 'not', 'especially', 'happy', 'man', ""'re"", 'widower', 'policeman', 'No', 'not', 'exactly', 'were', 'already', 'separated', 'guess', 'am', 'widower', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'miserable', 'one', 'struggles', 'understand', 'young', 'son', 'Inspector', 'Guilboud', 'understand', 'son', 'motive', 'then', 'understand', 'father', 'more', 'learn', 'however', 'more', 'fact', 'matter', 'same', 'son', 'murdered', 'man', 'killed', 'was', 'filth', 'Bernard', 'Descombes', 'eventually', 'Guilboud', 'empathy', 'Descombes', 'Even', 'so', 'Descombes', 'son', 'will', 'be', 'caught', 'France', 'funny', 'country', 'Guilboud', 'Fifty-million', 'inhabitants', 'twenty', 'million', 'informants', 'Descombes', 'son', 'represent', 'more', 'just', 'murderer', 'Guilboud', 'man', 'own', 'issues', 'may', 'see', 'something', 'Descombes', 'Descombes', 'however', 'who', 'make', 'hardest', 'journey', 'try', 'understand', 'who', 'son', 'is.The', 'Clockmaker', 'out', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'collaborations', 'Tavernier', 'Noiret', 'even', 'now', 'dull', 'political', 'subtext', 'complacent', 'suffocating', 'French', 'society', 'Still', 'movie', 'was', 'made', '1974', 'uneasy', 'period', 'movie', 'however', 'last', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'are', 'powerful', 'minutes', 'stand', 'son', 'complete', 'solidarity', 'Noiret', 'movie', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'worked', 'well', 'opinion', 'Noiret', 'Rochefort', 'very', 'well.Other', 'films', 'Tavernier', 'starring', 'Noiret', 'recommend', 'enthusiasm', 'includeCoup', 'Torchon', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'marvelous', 'black', 'comedy', 'Revenge', 'MusketeersandLife', 'Nothing', 'But.The', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'Kino', 'inexcusably', 'poor', 'cropped', 'fuzzy', 'dark', 'picture', 'poor', 'color', 'hues', 'subtitles', 'are', 'yellow', 'black', 'edging', 'are', 'easy', 'read', 'are', 'extras']",N/A

681116,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,B00005S3JH,Randy Keehn,"[0, 0]","""The Clockmaker"" turned out to be an interesting movie despite some annoying distractions.  It impressed me as the story of a man who had led a casual life and realized, almost too late, what he had missed out on.  His quiet, non-intrusive life was interupted one day when he finds that his son is accused of murder and is on the run.  The movie follows the father as he gradually becomes more and more involved with the issues surrounding the murder, the policeman who is in charge of the investigation, and the need to understand who this son of his really is.  I really enjoyed the way the subtle yet continuous changes emerged in the father.  He slowly loses his ""whatever"" outlook and apolitical attitude.  While he changes from someone we like into someone we're not sure of, we realize it's because of his need to better understand his son.  Although there really aren't any surprises, I'll leave it at that rather than risk saying too much.My objection to ""The Clockmaker"" is that it is described as a thriller.  On a Hitchcock standard, ""The Clockmaker"" would be the equivilent of ""The Wrong Man"".  If you haven't seen that one, you may have a long wait to do so.  It, too, had the expectation of a thriller by virtue of the director and was never really appreciated as the psychological study it was.  My other objection is the attempt at involving politics in the story.  The effort was lame and the effect was a distraction.  I came away with no real understanding of the issues (other than Owner vs. Worker 101).  The issue would pop up unnecessarily and too often; all the more reason that the father is the only true focus of the movie.",4,It's Never too Late,1210204800,"05 8, 2008",2008,1651,"['Clockmaker', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'interesting', 'movie', 'annoying', 'distractions', 'impressed', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'led', 'casual', 'life', 'realized', 'almost', 'too', 'late', 'what', 'had', 'missed', 'out', 'quiet', 'non-intrusive', 'life', 'was', 'interupted', 'one', 'day', 'when', 'son', 'accused', 'murder', 'run', 'movie', 'father', 'gradually', 'more', 'more', 'involved', 'issues', 'surrounding', 'murder', 'policeman', 'who', 'charge', 'investigation', 'need', 'understand', 'who', 'son', 'really', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'way', 'subtle', 'yet', 'continuous', 'changes', 'emerged', 'father', 'slowly', 'outlook', 'apolitical', 'attitude', 'someone', 'like', 'someone', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', 'realize', 'need', 'better', 'understand', 'son', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'surprises', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'rather', 'risk', 'saying', 'too', 'much.My', 'objection', 'Clockmaker', 'described', 'thriller', 'Hitchcock', 'standard', 'Clockmaker', 'would', 'be', 'equivilent', 'Wrong', 'Man', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'one', 'may', 'have', 'long', 'wait', 'do', 'so', 'too', 'had', 'expectation', 'thriller', 'virtue', 'director', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'appreciated', 'psychological', 'study', 'was', 'other', 'objection', 'attempt', 'involving', 'politics', 'story', 'effort', 'was', 'lame', 'effect', 'was', 'distraction', 'came', 'away', 'real', 'understanding', 'issues', 'other', 'Owner', 'vs.', 'Worker', '101', 'issue', 'would', 'pop', 'up', 'unnecessarily', 'too', 'often', 'more', 'reason', 'father', 'only', 'true', 'focus', 'movie']",N/A
