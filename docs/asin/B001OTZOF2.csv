1225287,AWNXS9TK4OVFV,B001OTZOF2,L. Mandelup,"[1, 1]","I purchased on amazon the Navy seal fitness guide and from the same author the one about the coast guard rescue swimmers. I love military style fitness so I also own the Navy Seal burn out PT challenge on VHS, I got that one from Brigade Quartermaster's old catalog. All of them are great and this DVD ranks right up there with them. It is a very different approach, as is everything with the Israelis, but I thought it was great. Also the instructor is fit yet humble and laid back in his approach. And yes you do see 45 pull-ups and a building get scaled in the rain. The DVD will enter my collection!",5,If you like military type workouts then this is for you,1268870400,"03 18, 2010",2010,603,"['purchased', 'Navy', 'seal', 'fitness', 'guide', 'same', 'author', 'one', 'coast', 'guard', 'rescue', 'swimmers', 'love', 'military', 'style', 'fitness', 'also', 'own', 'Navy', 'Seal', 'out', 'PT', 'challenge', 'VHS', 'got', 'one', 'Brigade', 'Quartermaster', 'old', 'catalog', 'are', 'great', 'DVD', 'ranks', 'right', 'up', 'there', 'very', 'different', 'approach', 'everything', 'Israelis', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'Also', 'instructor', 'fit', 'yet', 'humble', 'laid', 'back', 'approach', 'yes', 'do', 'see', '45', 'pull-ups', 'building', 'get', 'scaled', 'rain', 'DVD', 'will', 'enter', 'collection']",ISRAELI COMBAT FITNESS
1225288,A2954LN9RJRZ45,B001OTZOF2,R. Bielski,"[13, 13]","This DVD is one in a series of DVDs produced by the same group of guys who make several titles on Israeli combat techniques and run training courses through out North America. They have several titles out, about 7 that I know of.  They all draw from the Israeli format of training and technique, which is a different approach from the US special ops community. Many of the basic concepts and exercises remain the same that you might find in a US Navy SEAL workout. The other titles are more combat oriented.The DVD is very well produced and presented, is shot on seen where the exercises are performed, looks like Miami Florida. The beach is the set for some running, a pool for swimming and what looks like a converted studio for workouts much like I saw in their other productions. The workout portion runs 60+ minutes.The workout consists of cardio in the form of running (distance, sand, sprints, steps), swimming and punching bag work. Then they move on to dips, push-ups, abs, crunches and reverse crunches in various forms. The workout self adjusts for your level of fitness. Essentially this provides a complete full body workout. You also do not need any equipment, just some motivation, a place to workout and a couple of chairs or something suitable to do dips on, a ledge for pull-ups, most things are improvised in the DVD.In the first section the focus is on technique in which each of the movements that will be used within the workout are demonstrated. The next part describes the actual workout. I loved the idea of working out anywhere in 1 hour and getting to maintain the level of fitness no matter of time or location.If you are in great shape or at least in good shape the DVD will be perfect for you, The Israelis seem to have a good system developed here.Seeing as fitness is just one of many facets to being a warrior if follows that this DVD is in a series of instructional DVDs made for the combat soldier, although unconventional, the products of this program speaks for it self, I think its great and the guy presenting the information articulates and explains every detail.Over recent years, like in times past, more and more prominent military fitness guides and instructors have begun to advocate the use of body weight exercises,(Pull-ups, dips etc) probably due to there effectiveness, the reduction of the risk of injury and the total body workout that can be had at least from the methods that this author advocates. The guy on DVD does 45 pull-ups from a wooden ledge, and he climbs the side of a building in the rain as a demonstration of the capabilities of the program.I would have to say that I believe this DVD is worth the money and that the workout is challenging, comprehensive and I don't think you would find a better product unless there was a massive change in the way these types of products are made.",5,Israeli Combat Fitness,1245542400,"06 21, 2009",2009,2851,"['DVD', 'one', 'series', 'DVDs', 'produced', 'same', 'group', 'guys', 'who', 'make', 'several', 'titles', 'Israeli', 'combat', 'techniques', 'run', 'training', 'courses', 'North', 'America', 'have', 'several', 'titles', 'out', 'about', '7', 'know', 'draw', 'Israeli', 'format', 'training', 'technique', 'different', 'approach', 'US', 'special', 'ops', 'community', 'Many', 'basic', 'concepts', 'exercises', 'remain', 'same', 'might', 'find', 'US', 'Navy', 'SEAL', 'workout', 'other', 'titles', 'are', 'more', 'combat', 'oriented.The', 'DVD', 'very', 'well', 'produced', 'presented', 'shot', 'seen', 'where', 'exercises', 'are', 'performed', 'Miami', 'Florida', 'beach', 'set', 'running', 'pool', 'swimming', 'what', 'converted', 'studio', 'workouts', 'much', 'saw', 'other', 'productions', 'workout', 'portion', '60+', 'minutes.The', 'workout', 'cardio', 'form', 'running', 'distance', 'sand', 'sprints', 'steps', 'swimming', 'punching', 'bag', 'work', 'Then', 'move', 'dips', 'push-ups', 'abs', 'crunches', 'reverse', 'crunches', 'various', 'forms', 'workout', 'self', 'adjusts', 'level', 'fitness', 'Essentially', 'complete', 'full', 'body', 'workout', 'also', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'equipment', 'just', 'motivation', 'place', 'workout', 'couple', 'chairs', 'something', 'suitable', 'do', 'dips', 'ledge', 'pull-ups', 'most', 'things', 'are', 'improvised', 'DVD.In', 'first', 'section', 'focus', 'technique', 'movements', 'will', 'be', 'used', 'workout', 'are', 'demonstrated', 'next', 'part', 'actual', 'workout', 'loved', 'idea', 'working', 'out', 'anywhere', '1', 'hour', 'getting', 'maintain', 'level', 'fitness', 'matter', 'time', 'location.If', 'are', 'great', 'shape', 'least', 'good', 'shape', 'DVD', 'will', 'be', 'perfect', 'Israelis', 'seem', 'have', 'good', 'system', 'developed', 'here.Seeing', 'fitness', 'just', 'one', 'many', 'facets', 'being', 'warrior', 'DVD', 'series', 'instructional', 'DVDs', 'made', 'combat', 'soldier', 'unconventional', 'products', 'program', 'think', 'great', 'guy', 'presenting', 'information', 'articulates', 'detail.Over', 'recent', 'years', 'times', 'past', 'more', 'more', 'prominent', 'military', 'fitness', 'guides', 'instructors', 'have', 'begun', 'advocate', 'use', 'body', 'weight', 'exercises', 'Pull-ups', 'etc', 'probably', 'due', 'effectiveness', 'reduction', 'risk', 'injury', 'total', 'body', 'can', 'be', 'had', 'least', 'methods', 'author', 'guy', 'DVD', '45', 'pull-ups', 'wooden', 'ledge', 'side', 'building', 'rain', 'demonstration', 'capabilities', 'program.I', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'believe', 'DVD', 'money', 'workout', 'challenging', 'comprehensive', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'find', 'better', 'product', 'was', 'massive', 'change', 'way', 'types', 'products', 'are', 'made']",ISRAELI COMBAT FITNESS

I just got it in the mail 10 Days ago and decided to stop my regular cross-fit routine and try this out. It was similar in concept in that you give maximum effort in a short duration of time and the workouts are as exhausting as you make them. It focused on cardio, running, swimming and calisthenics, not weights. I liked that because I travel allot and don't have the equipment to do my cross-fit, but think this will be a great alternative in such a case, like traveling. Good stuff, and the guy on the DVD runs up a building and does 45 pull-ups from what looks like wooden plank.",5,"Like crossfit, sort of...",1268611200,"03 15, 2010",2010,666,"['Forget', 'film', 'quality', 'location', 'Content', 'DVDs', 'strong', 'point', 'just', 'got', 'mail', '10', 'Days', 'ago', 'decided', 'stop', 'regular', 'cross-fit', 'routine', 'try', 'out', 'was', 'similar', 'concept', 'give', 'maximum', 'effort', 'short', 'duration', 'time', 'workouts', 'are', 'as', 'exhausting', 'make', 'focused', 'cardio', 'running', 'swimming', 'calisthenics', 'not', 'weights', 'liked', 'travel', 'allot', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'equipment', 'do', 'cross-fit', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'great', 'alternative', 'such', 'case', 'traveling', 'Good', 'stuff', 'guy', 'DVD', 'up', 'building', '45', 'pull-ups', 'what', 'wooden', 'plank']",ISRAELI COMBAT FITNESS
