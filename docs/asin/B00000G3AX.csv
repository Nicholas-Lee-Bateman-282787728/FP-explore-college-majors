KIA RETURNS! ;-b""","[1, 1]","I have been a huge fan of animation since I was a kid and Disney while not my personal favorite then has climbed to the top of my list. This DVD contains a documentary featuring two of 'The 9 Old Men"" who brought so much magic to Disney and were the talent behind the genius Walt Disney.The documentary is informative and very entertaining with insight and humor told by these two very talented men who formed a life long friendship. The main feature runs about a hour and forty minutes.The bonus material is also very good, but there is a really irritating misstep in the menu. There is no Play All feature. Normally this wouldn't be a big deal, but the bonus material is broken up in 5 segments with 15 or so sub-segments. The lengths of these features range from 1 minute to 10 minutes all totaling around 45-55 minutes. Not having a Play All feature means that every couple minutes you have to go to the bonus menu and select another portion of these segments. It becomes tedious very quickly and brings my overall rating down a star.This is certainly no reason to keep from buying this DVD and if you're a fan of the behind the scenes stuff or Disney animation fan, you'll want to add this to your collection.",4,"FANTASTIC DOCUMENTARY, BUT MENU NEEDS WORK!",1366675200,"04 23, 2013",2013,1214,"['have', 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'animation', 'was', 'kid', 'Disney', 'not', 'personal', 'favorite', 'then', 'climbed', 'top', 'list', 'DVD', 'documentary', 'featuring', 'two', '9', 'Old', 'Men', 'who', 'brought', 'so', 'much', 'magic', 'Disney', 'were', 'talent', 'genius', 'Walt', 'Disney.The', 'documentary', 'informative', 'very', 'entertaining', 'insight', 'humor', 'told', 'two', 'very', 'talented', 'men', 'who', 'formed', 'life', 'long', 'friendship', 'main', 'feature', 'hour', 'forty', 'minutes.The', 'bonus', 'material', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'really', 'irritating', 'misstep', 'menu', 'Play', 'feature', 'Normally', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'big', 'deal', 'bonus', 'material', 'broken', 'up', '5', 'segments', '15', 'so', 'sub-segments', 'lengths', 'features', 'range', '1', 'minute', '10', 'minutes', 'totaling', '45-55', 'minutes', 'Not', 'having', 'Play', 'All', 'feature', 'couple', 'minutes', 'have', 'go', 'bonus', 'menu', 'select', 'portion', 'segments', 'tedious', 'very', 'quickly', 'brings', 'overall', 'rating', 'down', 'star.This', 'certainly', 'reason', 'keep', 'buying', 'DVD', ""'re"", 'fan', 'scenes', 'stuff', 'Disney', 'animation', 'fan', ""'ll"", 'want', 'add', 'collection']",Frank and Ollie VHS

We just recently obtained the DVD, partly to see the extras.  The 'bonus' items were good, although I would have liked more.  Something that discussed the ""Nine Old Men"" as a group, focusing on Frank and Ollie's role within that esteemed body would have been fantastic.

This is not to say that he doesn't deserve the credit for spearheading innovative material.

It provides biographical info on Frank and Ollie, their approach to animation over the years and inside info on some of the other animators they worked with during their time at Disney.

501087,A3OBBWCDNIYT8D,B00000G3AX,Stewart,"[15, 15]","&quot;Frank and Ollie&quot; is the most fasinating documentary I've ever seen. It takes a look at two of Walt Disney's &quot;Nine Old Men,&quot; Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston, from their early years at Disney in the 1930s to their everlasting friendship today. I am amazed at how they were able to get the expressions, emotions, and feelings on the characters they animated. They made faces to get the expressions of the characters, acted them out, and asked what the characters were thinking, and why were they feeling that way. This documentary kept a big smile on my face right from the beginning. I love documentaries about movies of all genres, and about the people who make them. This is no exception. It is very informative, affectionate, and heart-warming.

Very few people will ever meet the people who were actually there and actively involved in the early years of the Disney Company. On top of the stuff mentioned in the older reviews there are two things that brought tears to my eyes. First is Ollie's interest in trains. Ollie along with animator Ward Kimball played key rolls in re-igniting Walt Disney's interest in trains, which as you probably already know was a foundation of Disneyland. The other thing was Franks longtime membership in the famed jazz band, The Firehouse Five Plus Two who played regularly at Disneyland. All seven members of the band were Disney animators. That was what was so fun regarding that band. One could go to Disneyland in the 1950s and 1960s and hear them on the weekends, then as one walked around the park you could see the characters, all of whom the band members played a roll in creating!
