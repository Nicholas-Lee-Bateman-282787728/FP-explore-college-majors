Actually, his performance was okay, its just that the script just wasn't right as far as his part was concerned.  It didn't feel organic.  (I only made it through 1/2 the movie before I shut it off)Interestingly enough, my favorite parts of the movie are the parts in which Steve's character is absent.  In fact, if they had completely removed his character and just wrote a script without that character, this movie would have been better.Again, not to say Steve's performance wasn't decent, but rather, the script as far as his character was concerned just didn't work for me.Also, parts of the script felt contrived, moreso than a comedy should.I guess, I feel the entire script just needed another draft/editing session.Basically, this is one of those things that was a great idea, but the execution was lacking.

1393837,A3U2REB8VQ6RHY,B004AV5GX6,"Amy Tiemann ""aka Mojo Mom""","[0, 2]","I rented Dinner for Schmucks fully braced for the possibility that it could be the worst movie ever.  But--I also had faith in Steve Carell to make something special out of something silly. We were not disappointed.  Carell's quirky humor hit us just the right way.  Our family loved the movie and my tween hasn't stopped talking about it and quoting it since seeing it a couple of weeks ago.I was prepared to love Carell (who has never disappointed except in the bland ""Evan Almightly"") and to like Paul Rudd, but the biggest surprise was Jemaine Clement's turn as the overbearing artist Kieran.  Kieran is pretentious, narcissistic, and also hilarious and genuinely kinder to Carell's ""loser"" Barry than Paul Rudd's character is.  I ended up finding Kieran to be a strangely likable character who also some of the craziest lines in the movie.The actual ""Dinner for Winners"" event itself was suitably odd and mostly funny, mostly because of Barry's mind war with his arch-nemesis Therman played by Zach Galifinakis. I could take or leave most of the other oddball losers on hand.The movie's PG-13 rating is accurate and we had to fast-forward a few scenes with the crazy stalker Darla since we were watching with a middle schooler, but honestly, the kid in the room was the one who loved it the most.  ""Dinner for Schmucks"" struck me as Judd Apatow meets Monty Python--if you appreciate a certain kind of wacky, geeky slapstick humor, this might even qualify as a family movie in your house.",4,Schmucks has gained brain control over my family,1301702400,"04 2, 2011",2011,1492,"['rented', 'Dinner', 'Schmucks', 'fully', 'braced', 'possibility', 'could', 'be', 'worst', 'movie', 'ever', 'also', 'had', 'faith', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'make', 'something', 'special', 'something', 'silly', 'were', 'not', 'disappointed', 'Carell', 'quirky', 'humor', 'hit', 'just', 'right', 'way', 'family', 'loved', 'movie', 'tween', ""n't"", 'stopped', 'talking', 'quoting', 'seeing', 'couple', 'weeks', 'ago.I', 'was', 'prepared', 'love', 'Carell', 'who', 'never', 'disappointed', 'bland', 'Evan', 'Almightly', 'like', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'biggest', 'surprise', 'was', 'Jemaine', 'Clement', 'turn', 'overbearing', 'artist', 'Kieran', 'Kieran', 'pretentious', 'narcissistic', 'also', 'hilarious', 'genuinely', 'kinder', 'Carell', 'loser', 'Barry', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'character', 'ended', 'up', 'finding', 'Kieran', 'be', 'strangely', 'likable', 'character', 'who', 'also', 'craziest', 'lines', 'movie.The', 'actual', 'Dinner', 'Winners', 'event', 'was', 'suitably', 'odd', 'mostly', 'funny', 'mostly', 'Barry', 'mind', 'war', 'arch-nemesis', 'Therman', 'played', 'Zach', 'Galifinakis', 'could', 'take', 'leave', 'most', 'other', 'oddball', 'losers', 'hand.The', 'movie', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'accurate', 'had', 'fast-forward', 'few', 'scenes', 'crazy', 'stalker', 'Darla', 'were', 'watching', 'middle', 'schooler', 'honestly', 'kid', 'room', 'was', 'one', 'who', 'loved', 'most', 'Dinner', 'Schmucks', 'struck', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'meets', 'Monty', 'Python', 'appreciate', 'certain', 'kind', 'wacky', 'geeky', 'slapstick', 'humor', 'might', 'even', 'qualify', 'family', 'movie', 'house']",Dinner for Schmucks

1393839,AQQBRDQ2QJOO8,B004AV5GX6,Andrew C Wheeler,"[2, 3]","DINNER FOR SCHMUCKS isn't really a good movie in any standard way -- though it does end up being reasonably funny in the last half-hour, to salvage the experience of watching it somewhat -- but it is an excellent object lesson in how to take a good movie and dumb it down in every way possible. SCHMUCKS is a remake of the French filmThe Dinner Game, which was elegant, smart, pared-down, and absolutely hilarious.Where DINNER GAME had a morally ambiguous man at its center, SCHMUCKS has Paul Rudd, playing Paul Rudd, the good-natured befuddled bright-faced boy-man he always is. Where DINNER GAME dove right into its central situation -- privileged folks have a monthly party, to which each of them bring an ""idiot"" for their secret amusement -- SCHMUCKS has to spend a prefatory half-hour carefully signposting every element of the plot and making sure Rudd's character is up to the Hollywood standard of likability. And in every way that DINNER GAME was understated and smart, SCHMUCKS is big and stupid.So SCHMUCKS spends nearly an hour -- a long, tedious, obvious hour, particularly to anyone who has seen Party -- setting its trite, cliched plot into careful place, and then finally starts running downhill, as much as it can. There is nothing at all that this movie does that DINNER GAME doesn't do twice as well, and there is no reason to see this movie unless you have a very low opinion of your own standards, or a masochistic taste for bad American comedy.",2,A deliberate insult to American intelligence,1302912000,"04 16, 2011",2011,1467,"['DINNER', 'FOR', 'SCHMUCKS', ""n't"", 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'standard', 'way', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'reasonably', 'funny', 'last', 'half-hour', 'salvage', 'experience', 'watching', 'somewhat', 'excellent', 'object', 'lesson', 'how', 'take', 'good', 'movie', 'dumb', 'down', 'way', 'possible', 'SCHMUCKS', 'remake', 'French', 'filmThe', 'Dinner', 'Game', 'was', 'elegant', 'smart', 'pared-down', 'absolutely', 'hilarious.Where', 'DINNER', 'GAME', 'had', 'morally', 'ambiguous', 'man', 'center', 'SCHMUCKS', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'playing', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'good-natured', 'befuddled', 'bright-faced', 'boy-man', 'always', 'Where', 'DINNER', 'GAME', 'dove', 'right', 'central', 'situation', 'privileged', 'folks', 'have', 'monthly', 'party', 'bring', 'idiot', 'secret', 'amusement', 'SCHMUCKS', 'spend', 'prefatory', 'half-hour', 'carefully', 'signposting', 'element', 'plot', 'making', 'sure', 'Rudd', 'character', 'Hollywood', 'standard', 'likability', 'way', 'DINNER', 'GAME', 'was', 'understated', 'smart', 'SCHMUCKS', 'big', 'stupid.So', 'SCHMUCKS', 'nearly', 'hour', 'long', 'tedious', 'obvious', 'hour', 'particularly', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'Party', 'setting', 'trite', 'cliched', 'plot', 'careful', 'place', 'then', 'finally', 'running', 'downhill', 'as', 'much', 'can', 'nothing', 'movie', 'DINNER', 'GAME', ""n't"", 'do', 'twice', 'as', 'well', 'reason', 'see', 'movie', 'have', 'very', 'low', 'opinion', 'own', 'standards', 'masochistic', 'taste', 'bad', 'American', 'comedy']",Dinner for Schmucks
1393840,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B004AV5GX6,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","Sometimes my love a certain actor will force me to subject myself to films I would normally run far away from.  `Dinner for Schmucks' is one of those films that I probably would not have ever even entertained the notion of seeing had it not starred Paul Rudd; an actor who I have this weird crush on (he's so pinchably cute and his sense of humor sits very well with me).  So, regardless of my initially worry, I didn't really have to be talked into seeing this movie since there are moments when `really stupid funny' does just the trick.So...While I did laugh, and at one particular point I was actually crying in laughter (that whole Darla fight sequence was hysterical), when all was said and done I was disappointed in the direction taken with what could have been a no-nonsense laugh riot.  Instead, `Dinner for Schmucks' is either too dumb or too tame for its own good.  It needed to find a balance that worked, or go to the extreme.  It just felt like it was holding back too much in parts, and then in others it went too far in a way that wasn't funny.The film tells the story of Tim.  Tim is a hard worker with a life that would be the envy of nearly every warm-blooded male.  He has a gorgeous apartment, a Porsche and a smoking hot French (?) girlfriend who obviously dotes on him.  When he is given the opportunity to clutch a much deserved promotion, his life course hits a snag.  It appears that the higher-ups in the company are, well, very mean people.  In fact, they host a dinner once a month where they invite unsuspecting idiots and make fun of them all evening.  Tim is hesitant, especially since his girlfriend is disgusted by the idea, but then fate intervenes and he meets Barry; a taxidermist who makes `mousterpieces' with dead mice.  But, Tim should have never talked to Barry or invited him to dinner because Barry is lonely and accident prone (in about every possible way) and is determined to `help' Tim in any way possible; which of course does far more damage than good.I wish I could say that the acting saves this, but it really doesn't.  When the gags hit right, they hit hard...but it becomes apparent about halfway in that the gags that hit are few and far in-between.  Carell can play the lovable idiot well, and so you can't help but laugh at some of his quirks, but I didn't feel a real connect between him and Rudd.  Rudd, sadly, phones this one in as well.  I really LOVE this guy but his schick doesn't work so well here.  I also kind of hate it when the script maps out such a ridiculously frustrated situation.  People DO talk to one another, and it is very odd to me to believe that a woman who loves a man so much she wants to marry him would refuse to allow him to explain a situation fully before leaving him.  I also found the fact that the dinner itself was such a small part of the film, and I really wanted it to be the bulk of it.  THAT is where you really had potential to make this so stupid funny it was actually funny, but instead it felt lazy and underdeveloped.  Yes, Zack Galifianakis is HILARIOUS and he does make his ridiculous dialog feel somewhat inspired, but there was so much more that could have been done to make this better.The clich&eacute;s are a sad inclusion (why does every comedy of this nature have to distress every relationship only to resolve everything in such a similarly contrived manner?) but an expected one.  I just really thought that Rudd and Carell would carry this movie on their shoulders, but instead they kind of dropped the ball in a major way.",2,Don't be a schmuck...,1313366400,"08 15, 2011",2011,3540,"['Sometimes', 'love', 'certain', 'actor', 'will', 'force', 'subject', 'films', 'would', 'normally', 'run', 'far', 'away', 'Dinner', 'Schmucks', 'one', 'films', 'probably', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'ever', 'even', 'entertained', 'notion', 'seeing', 'had', 'not', 'starred', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'actor', 'who', 'have', 'weird', 'crush', 'so', 'pinchably', 'cute', 'sense', 'humor', 'sits', 'very', 'well', 'So', 'regardless', 'initially', 'worry', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'be', 'talked', 'seeing', 'movie', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'really', 'stupid', 'funny', 'just', 'trick.So', 'did', 'laugh', 'one', 'particular', 'point', 'was', 'actually', 'crying', 'laughter', 'whole', 'Darla', 'fight', 'sequence', 'was', 'hysterical', 'when', 'was', 'said', 'done', 'was', 'disappointed', 'direction', 'taken', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'no-nonsense', 'laugh', 'riot', 'Instead', 'Dinner', 'Schmucks', 'too', 'dumb', 'too', 'tame', 'own', 'good', 'needed', 'find', 'balance', 'worked', 'go', 'extreme', 'just', 'felt', 'was', 'holding', 'back', 'too', 'much', 'parts', 'then', 'others', 'went', 'too', 'far', 'way', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny.The', 'film', 'story', 'Tim', 'Tim', 'hard', 'worker', 'life', 'would', 'be', 'envy', 'nearly', 'warm-blooded', 'male', 'gorgeous', 'apartment', 'Porsche', 'smoking', 'hot', 'French', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'obviously', 'When', 'given', 'opportunity', 'clutch', 'much', 'deserved', 'promotion', 'life', 'course', 'snag', 'higher-ups', 'company', 'are', 'well', 'very', 'mean', 'people', 'fact', 'host', 'dinner', 'once', 'month', 'where', 'invite', 'unsuspecting', 'idiots', 'make', 'fun', 'evening', 'Tim', 'hesitant', 'especially', 'girlfriend', 'disgusted', 'idea', 'then', 'fate', 'intervenes', 'Barry', 'taxidermist', 'who', 'mousterpieces', 'dead', 'mice', 'Tim', 'should', 'have', 'never', 'talked', 'Barry', 'invited', 'dinner', 'Barry', 'lonely', 'accident', 'prone', 'about', 'possible', 'way', 'determined', 'help', 'Tim', 'way', 'possible', 'course', 'far', 'more', 'damage', 'good.I', 'wish', 'could', 'say', 'acting', 'saves', 'really', ""n't"", 'When', 'gags', 'hit', 'right', 'hit', 'hard', 'apparent', 'halfway', 'gags', 'hit', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'in-between', 'Carell', 'can', 'play', 'lovable', 'idiot', 'well', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'laugh', 'quirks', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'real', 'connect', 'Rudd', 'Rudd', 'sadly', 'phones', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'really', 'LOVE', 'guy', 'schick', ""n't"", 'work', 'so', 'well', 'here', 'also', 'kind', 'hate', 'when', 'script', 'out', 'such', 'ridiculously', 'frustrated', 'situation', 'People', 'DO', 'talk', 'one', 'very', 'odd', 'believe', 'woman', 'who', 'man', 'so', 'much', 'marry', 'would', 'refuse', 'allow', 'explain', 'situation', 'fully', 'leaving', 'also', 'found', 'fact', 'dinner', 'was', 'such', 'small', 'part', 'film', 'really', 'wanted', 'be', 'bulk', 'where', 'really', 'had', 'potential', 'make', 'so', 'stupid', 'funny', 'was', 'actually', 'funny', 'instead', 'felt', 'lazy', 'underdeveloped', 'Yes', 'Zack', 'Galifianakis', 'HILARIOUS', 'make', 'ridiculous', 'dialog', 'feel', 'somewhat', 'inspired', 'there', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'make', 'better.The', 'clich', 'eacute', 'are', 'sad', 'inclusion', 'why', 'comedy', 'nature', 'have', 'distress', 'relationship', 'only', 'resolve', 'everything', 'such', 'similarly', 'contrived', 'manner', 'expected', 'one', 'just', 'really', 'thought', 'Rudd', 'Carell', 'would', 'carry', 'movie', 'shoulders', 'instead', 'kind', 'dropped', 'ball', 'major', 'way']",Dinner for Schmucks

1393851,A1L8GEOTWDNV19,B004AV5GX6,B. M Sullivan,"[1, 5]","The first 30 minutes of this film are very very funny and seemed to indicate that this film was moving in a positive direction. However, soon after Rudd meets Carell's character the idiot formula gets very stale very quickly. Carell's character is so bad in fact, that he can only be tolerated in small doses, something lost on the scriptwriter and director of this movie.This movie should have been primarily about Rudd interspersed with smatterings of Carell, the bumbling idiot, at his side. However, once Carell comes on screen he never leaves for the rest of the movie. And that is really what brings the movie down to the point of being almost unwatchable. Thankfully it manages to tie things together nicely at the end in a cute and humorous way, but it still doesn't make up for half the movie being some of the worst film making I've ever seen.I was tempted to deliver a one star rating on this one, but I have to be honest and say that some moments are genuinely funny and I found myself laughing quite a bit. However, I found myself equally cursing the film during it's midpoint lull of horrible comedy that few would find funny. I recommend renting this one so you can fast forward through these painfully bad scenes.Strangely enough, the feel good message of the film seemed to be lost on the audience. There was something highly ironic about a film teaching us to be kind to idiots while using those same idiots to generate all of it's laughs.Honestly there was a great film somewhere amidst the rubble, but it just got completely bungled by moving the focus too much on Carell's stupidity and not enough on Judd's transformative journey.On a final note I also want to add that Jemaine Clement is, as always, completely brilliant in this film in the role of Kieran.",2,"Has it's share of laughs, but goes overboard with Carell's character",1282608000,"08 24, 2010",2010,1779,"['first', '30', 'minutes', 'film', 'are', 'very', 'very', 'funny', 'seemed', 'indicate', 'film', 'was', 'moving', 'positive', 'direction', 'However', 'soon', 'Rudd', 'Carell', 'character', 'idiot', 'formula', 'very', 'stale', 'very', 'quickly', 'Carell', 'character', 'so', 'bad', 'fact', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'tolerated', 'small', 'doses', 'something', 'lost', 'scriptwriter', 'director', 'movie.This', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'primarily', 'Rudd', 'interspersed', 'smatterings', 'Carell', 'bumbling', 'idiot', 'side', 'However', 'once', 'Carell', 'screen', 'never', 'rest', 'movie', 'really', 'what', 'movie', 'down', 'point', 'being', 'almost', 'unwatchable', 'Thankfully', 'tie', 'things', 'together', 'nicely', 'end', 'cute', 'humorous', 'way', 'still', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'movie', 'being', 'worst', 'film', 'making', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.I', 'was', 'tempted', 'deliver', 'one', 'star', 'rating', 'one', 'have', 'be', 'honest', 'say', 'moments', 'are', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'found', 'laughing', 'quite', 'bit', 'However', 'found', 'equally', 'cursing', 'film', 'midpoint', 'lull', 'horrible', 'comedy', 'few', 'would', 'find', 'funny', 'recommend', 'renting', 'one', 'so', 'can', 'fast', 'forward', 'painfully', 'bad', 'scenes.Strangely', 'enough', 'feel', 'good', 'message', 'film', 'seemed', 'be', 'lost', 'audience', 'was', 'something', 'highly', 'ironic', 'film', 'teaching', 'be', 'kind', 'idiots', 'using', 'same', 'idiots', 'generate', 'laughs.Honestly', 'was', 'great', 'film', 'somewhere', 'rubble', 'just', 'got', 'completely', 'bungled', 'moving', 'focus', 'too', 'much', 'Carell', 'stupidity', 'not', 'enough', 'Judd', 'transformative', 'journey.On', 'final', 'note', 'also', 'want', 'add', 'Jemaine', 'Clement', 'always', 'completely', 'brilliant', 'film', 'role', 'Kieran']",Dinner for Schmucks

1393859,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B004AV5GX6,Chris Pandolfi,"[6, 12]","I'm missing something here. I understand that the real schmucks of ""Dinner for Schmucks"" are played by Bruce Greenwood, Larry Wilmore, and Ron Livingston, not Paul Rudd and Steve Carell, and that means I should be able to see how certain characters and plot elements are ultimately redeemed. So then why do I still feel that this movie is ugly, spiteful, and profoundly unfunny? How is it that I cannot bring myself to feel anything for the characters I'm supposed to have feelings for? What is the one element that makes such unpleasantness okay to sit through? What am I failing to see? Many have been praising ""Dinner for Schmucks"" for its slapstick comedy and its representation of character, but to me, it's a deep mystery, raising the question of how anyone could ever find it entertaining.Perhaps it all has to do with the underlying premise, which is so mean-spirited that no amount of broad humor could make me look past it. In the film, a group of high powered executives, all arrogant, hold an annual dinner party in which they showcase the dumbest people they can find, people who all claim to have special talents and seem to enjoy flaunting them. To me, this isn't comedy, but rather a study in human cruelty. It doesn't matter that the joke is on the executives and not on the guests; the fact that they're all too stupid to realize how badly they're being treated only makes the movie's idea that much more depressing. Why? Because, even after the dinner is over, they will continue to live in a state of hopeless ignorance. This is no way to live. This is just plain sad.Such a person is IRS employee Barry Speck (Carell), who always displays big toothy grins and seems to enjoy laughing a lot. He literally doesn't have a clue. He does things without really thinking them through first. He makes the lives of those around him a living hell, although he believes he's actually helping them, which I guess is to be expected since this is a comedy of errors. I suspect I was supposed to like this character, especially at the end of the film. That's the problem - I didn't like him one bit. His ignorance was annoying. His sweet natured clumsiness was infuriating. And then there's his ""talent,"" which is collecting dead mice, having them stuffed and dressed in various tiny costumes, and then posing them in highly detailed dioramas and model scenes. I'm sorry, but I find this incredibly disturbing.The plot, which is adapted from the French film ""Le Dner de Cons"" (itself adapted from a play), begins with Tim Conrad (Rudd), a financial executive clawing his way up the corporate ladder, his latest negotiation with a wealthy Swiss businessman (David Walliams) having gone well. Impressed, Tim's boss, Lance Fender (Greenwood), invites him to take part in the aforementioned dinner. Lo and behold, he literally rams into Barry, who then clings to Tim like a dog who has just found a new best friend. Over the course of a day, a night, and a brunch, Barry systematically ruins Tim's life. He mistakenly reintroduces him to an ex-girlfriend (Lucy Punch), a stalker so frightening it's a wonder Tim never tried filing a restraining order. This, in turn, jeopardizes his relationship with his current girlfriend, Julie (Stephanie Szostak), who is never ready to say yes when he proposes to her.Despite the title, the dinner isn't seen until the very end, at which point the plot's unflinching cruelty left me mentally drained. This is bad because the dinner is one of relentless absurdity - everything and everyone involved is so unbelievably silly that I just couldn't process it anymore. Over the course of this scene, we see a ventriloquist that thinks his dummy is his wife, a blind swordsman, a dead animal medium (who reacts grotesquely to her lobster dinner), and Barry's boss (Zach Galifinakis), a man who believes he has the ability to control people's minds; with such a large gathering of odd, goofy people, the scene becomes a chaotic free-for-all, one that very quickly becomes unappealing and unfunny.Knowing that Fender and his cronies are heartless, knowing that the invited idiots are too idiotic to understand that they're idiots, and knowing that Tim went along with it all for the sake of getting ahead in business, I simply cannot bring myself to say anything nice about ""Dinner for Schmucks."" Why is this? The ending is one of sweet - albeit twisted - redemption, which means I should be able to look past everything that made my skin crawl. But some movies are just too nasty for their own good, and no amount of last-minute hopefulness can gloss over that. It's a story about mean people doing mean things, and as far as I'm concerned, that doesn't qualify as entertainment. I felt sad leaving the theater, and I secretly hoped that the filmmakers would someday understand just how wrong their efforts were.",2,A Mean Film About Mean People,1280880000,"08 4, 2010",2010,4845,"[""'m"", 'missing', 'something', 'here', 'understand', 'real', 'schmucks', 'Dinner', 'Schmucks', 'are', 'played', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'Larry', 'Wilmore', 'Ron', 'Livingston', 'not', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'how', 'certain', 'characters', 'plot', 'elements', 'are', 'ultimately', 'redeemed', 'So', 'then', 'why', 'do', 'still', 'feel', 'movie', 'ugly', 'spiteful', 'profoundly', 'unfunny', 'How', 'can', 'not', 'bring', 'feel', 'anything', 'characters', ""'m"", 'supposed', 'have', 'feelings', 'What', 'one', 'element', 'such', 'unpleasantness', 'okay', 'sit', 'What', 'am', 'failing', 'see', 'Many', 'have', 'been', 'praising', 'Dinner', 'Schmucks', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'representation', 'character', 'deep', 'mystery', 'raising', 'question', 'how', 'anyone', 'could', 'ever', 'find', 'do', 'underlying', 'premise', 'so', 'mean-spirited', 'amount', 'broad', 'humor', 'could', 'make', 'look', 'film', 'group', 'high', 'powered', 'executives', 'arrogant', 'hold', 'annual', 'dinner', 'party', 'showcase', 'dumbest', 'people', 'can', 'find', 'people', 'who', 'claim', 'have', 'special', 'talents', 'seem', 'enjoy', 'flaunting', ""n't"", 'comedy', 'rather', 'study', 'human', 'cruelty', ""n't"", 'matter', 'joke', 'executives', 'not', 'guests', 'fact', ""'re"", 'too', 'stupid', 'realize', 'how', 'badly', ""'re"", 'being', 'treated', 'only', 'movie', 'idea', 'much', 'more', 'depressing', 'Why', 'even', 'dinner', 'over', 'will', 'continue', 'live', 'state', 'hopeless', 'ignorance', 'way', 'live', 'just', 'plain', 'sad.Such', 'person', 'IRS', 'employee', 'Barry', 'Speck', 'Carell', 'who', 'always', 'displays', 'big', 'toothy', 'grins', 'enjoy', 'laughing', 'lot', 'literally', ""n't"", 'have', 'clue', 'things', 'really', 'thinking', 'first', 'lives', 'living', 'hell', 'actually', 'helping', 'guess', 'be', 'expected', 'comedy', 'errors', 'suspect', 'was', 'supposed', 'like', 'character', 'especially', 'end', 'film', 'problem', 'did', ""n't"", 'one', 'bit', 'ignorance', 'was', 'annoying', 'sweet', 'natured', 'clumsiness', 'was', 'infuriating', 'then', 'talent', 'collecting', 'dead', 'mice', 'having', 'stuffed', 'dressed', 'various', 'tiny', 'costumes', 'then', 'posing', 'highly', 'detailed', 'dioramas', 'model', 'scenes', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'find', 'incredibly', 'disturbing.The', 'plot', 'adapted', 'French', 'film', 'Le', 'Dner', 'de', 'Cons', 'adapted', 'play', 'Tim', 'Conrad', 'Rudd', 'financial', 'executive', 'clawing', 'way', 'corporate', 'ladder', 'latest', 'negotiation', 'wealthy', 'Swiss', 'businessman', 'David', 'Walliams', 'having', 'gone', 'well', 'Impressed', 'Tim', 'boss', 'Lance', 'Fender', 'Greenwood', 'take', 'part', 'aforementioned', 'dinner', 'Lo', 'behold', 'literally', 'Barry', 'who', 'then', 'Tim', 'dog', 'who', 'just', 'found', 'new', 'best', 'friend', 'course', 'day', 'night', 'brunch', 'Barry', 'systematically', 'Tim', 'life', 'mistakenly', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Lucy', 'Punch', 'stalker', 'so', 'frightening', 'wonder', 'Tim', 'never', 'tried', 'filing', 'restraining', 'order', 'turn', 'relationship', 'current', 'girlfriend', 'Julie', 'Stephanie', 'Szostak', 'who', 'never', 'ready', 'say', 'yes', 'when', 'her.Despite', 'title', 'dinner', ""n't"", 'seen', 'very', 'end', 'point', 'plot', 'unflinching', 'cruelty', 'left', 'mentally', 'drained', 'bad', 'dinner', 'one', 'relentless', 'absurdity', 'everything', 'everyone', 'involved', 'so', 'unbelievably', 'silly', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'process', 'anymore', 'course', 'scene', 'see', 'ventriloquist', 'dummy', 'wife', 'blind', 'swordsman', 'dead', 'animal', 'medium', 'who', 'grotesquely', 'lobster', 'dinner', 'Barry', 'boss', 'Zach', 'Galifinakis', 'man', 'who', 'ability', 'control', 'people', 'minds', 'large', 'gathering', 'odd', 'goofy', 'people', 'scene', 'chaotic', 'free-for-all', 'one', 'very', 'quickly', 'unappealing', 'unfunny.Knowing', 'Fender', 'cronies', 'are', 'heartless', 'knowing', 'invited', 'idiots', 'are', 'too', 'idiotic', 'understand', ""'re"", 'idiots', 'knowing', 'Tim', 'went', 'sake', 'getting', 'ahead', 'business', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'bring', 'say', 'anything', 'nice', 'Dinner', 'Schmucks', 'Why', 'ending', 'one', 'sweet', 'albeit', 'twisted', 'redemption', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'look', 'past', 'everything', 'made', 'skin', 'crawl', 'movies', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'nasty', 'own', 'good', 'amount', 'last-minute', 'hopefulness', 'can', 'gloss', 'over', 'story', 'mean', 'people', 'doing', 'mean', 'things', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', ""n't"", 'qualify', 'entertainment', 'felt', 'sad', 'leaving', 'theater', 'secretly', 'hoped', 'filmmakers', 'would', 'someday', 'understand', 'just', 'how', 'wrong', 'efforts', 'were']",Dinner for Schmucks

Carell simply elevates every scene he's in, making stupid jokes funny and gives you the go-ahead to laugh about terrible things. Cast anybody else in that role, and the film is a mean-spirited and unfunny dud. Take for example the final dinner scene. Carell delivers the Dreamers speech perfectly, and then when Zach Galifianakis gets up and does his thing, which is terrible, mean-spirited and downright sad, you laugh and feel for the character because of the energy and love Carell injects into the role. In fact, his whole character in general is kind of depressing. He makes the Mouseterpieces to express himself. I mean, there's a scene where Paul Rudd is going through a few of Carell's Mouseterpieces, and it's portraits of that character's troubled marriage and his wife breaking up with him. It's presented in a silly way, but not only does the film make it emotional, but Carell makes it work with the character. It takes real talent, and pretty decent writing/direction to do that, and Dinner for Idiots does it well.Not to say the rest of the movie is bad, it's just kind of underwhelming for most of it. Paul Rudd does what Paul Rudd does, and his relationship story simply isn't interesting without Jermaine Clement or Steve Carell to spice it up, until the end. Oh, and then there's that dirty, dirty stalker. Terrible and easy jokes are made with that, but they're still pretty dang funny. During Inception, my head hurt because I was thinking too much. During Dinner for Idiots, my head hurt because I was laughing too much.Overall, one would fear that the trailers would give away all the jokes, but in context, the film is completely different, in a good way. It balances the awkward and painful moments well, and comes together with a great climax that while may be a little clich&eacute;, is crowd-pleasing all the way. In fact, when the film was over, my audience audibly clapped for a while to express their pleasure with the film. Give it a watch, and you will laugh. When you laugh and how often will depend, but rest assured, you will most likely laugh. And that's what a good comedy does.

It takes a while for the momentum to build in this film, but the film's second half, where we learn more about Barry and we wait for the dinner scene, is worth the wait. There's some formula to the story line as well, but the entertainment is in the eccentric, offbeat characters, particularly Barry (Steve Carrell) and his fellow IRS co-worker (Zach Galifianakis ), who deliver some laughs.In the film, Tim (Paul Rudd) is trying to climb the corporate ladder at his job. When Tim wows his boss with a sales pitch, he is unexpectedly invited to a dinner with some of the big shots. However, there's a catch. His boss has an unusual (and mean-spirited) tradition of having a contest to see who can bring the biggest imbecile to the company dinner. Tim has a random encounter with Barry, who stumbles in front of his car. Barry is an odd sort of fellow, and he has an unusual hobby of recreating works of art with stuffed mice. Tim believes he's found his guy for the dinner. However, when Barry accidentally shows up a day early to Tim's place, he begins to inadvertently wreak havoc on Tim's personal life, particularly his relationship with his girlfriend, Julie. Tim can't seem to get Barry away long enough to correct things, and there are some great antics as we wait for the dinner the next day.The odd assortment of characters adds to the film's entertainment. Clearly Steve Carrell was made for this role of Barry, and he makes the film more enjoyable. Carrell brings that innocent stupidity to his character that makes you sympathize with him. There's a great moment when Barry takes Tim to meet one of his coworkers (Zach Galifianakis), who supposedly can read minds. Barry is unable to overcome his coworker's ""power"" of mental detection. Later, Barry and his coworker square off in a battle of mind over mind at the dinner party. The dinner party scene, with its brand of oddballs, is comical as well.Despite the mean-spiritedness at times in the film, Dinner for Schmucks is essentially a film with heart. Tim's character begins to change, as he feels a sense of guilt for what he is putting Barry through. Barry has a simple, innocent quality that makes him quite sympathetic. The film's resolution was fairly predictable, and maybe the film was a tad too long (just under two hours), but I don't think this film is as bad as people are making it out to be.The extras include some outtakes, deleted scenes, and some behind the scenes with the cast.Comedy is definitely a matter of opinion, but I think that Dinner for Schmucks was definitely palatable.",4,"Oddball characters, weird, different, but ultimately entertaining",1295222400,"01 17, 2011",2011,2715,"['Dinner', 'Schmucks', 'odd', 'bizarre', 'uneven', 'awkward', 'bit', 'predictable', 'definitely', 'not', 'shallow', 'ultimately', 'entertaining', 'comedy', 'heart', 'while', 'momentum', 'build', 'film', 'film', 'second', 'half', 'where', 'learn', 'more', 'Barry', 'wait', 'dinner', 'scene', 'wait', 'formula', 'story', 'line', 'well', 'entertainment', 'eccentric', 'offbeat', 'characters', 'particularly', 'Barry', 'Steve', 'Carrell', 'fellow', 'IRS', 'co-worker', 'Zach', 'Galifianakis', 'who', 'deliver', 'laughs.In', 'film', 'Tim', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'trying', 'climb', 'corporate', 'ladder', 'job', 'When', 'Tim', 'boss', 'sales', 'pitch', 'unexpectedly', 'invited', 'dinner', 'big', 'shots', 'However', 'catch', 'boss', 'unusual', 'mean-spirited', 'tradition', 'having', 'contest', 'see', 'who', 'can', 'bring', 'biggest', 'imbecile', 'company', 'dinner', 'Tim', 'random', 'encounter', 'Barry', 'who', 'front', 'car', 'Barry', 'odd', 'sort', 'fellow', 'unusual', 'hobby', 'recreating', 'works', 'art', 'stuffed', 'mice', 'Tim', 'found', 'guy', 'dinner', 'However', 'when', 'Barry', 'accidentally', 'up', 'day', 'early', 'Tim', 'place', 'inadvertently', 'wreak', 'havoc', 'Tim', 'personal', 'life', 'particularly', 'relationship', 'girlfriend', 'Julie', 'Tim', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'Barry', 'away', 'long', 'enough', 'correct', 'things', 'are', 'great', 'antics', 'wait', 'dinner', 'next', 'day.The', 'odd', 'assortment', 'characters', 'film', 'entertainment', 'Clearly', 'Steve', 'Carrell', 'was', 'made', 'role', 'Barry', 'film', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'Carrell', 'innocent', 'stupidity', 'character', 'sympathize', 'great', 'moment', 'when', 'Barry', 'Tim', 'meet', 'one', 'coworkers', 'Zach', 'Galifianakis', 'who', 'supposedly', 'can', 'read', 'minds', 'Barry', 'unable', 'overcome', 'coworker', 'power', 'mental', 'detection', 'Later', 'Barry', 'coworker', 'square', 'off', 'battle', 'mind', 'mind', 'dinner', 'party', 'dinner', 'party', 'scene', 'brand', 'oddballs', 'comical', 'well.Despite', 'mean-spiritedness', 'times', 'film', 'Dinner', 'Schmucks', 'essentially', 'film', 'heart', 'Tim', 'character', 'change', 'sense', 'guilt', 'what', 'putting', 'Barry', 'Barry', 'simple', 'innocent', 'quality', 'quite', 'sympathetic', 'film', 'resolution', 'was', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'maybe', 'film', 'was', 'tad', 'too', 'long', 'just', 'two', 'hours', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'as', 'bad', 'people', 'are', 'making', 'be.The', 'extras', 'include', 'outtakes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'scenes', 'cast.Comedy', 'definitely', 'matter', 'opinion', 'think', 'Dinner', 'Schmucks', 'was', 'definitely', 'palatable']",Dinner for Schmucks

When I saw that this was PG-13, I lowered my expectations, and because of that, I was able to enjoy it for what it was.I could tell by the trailer(s) that it wasn't gonna be a hysterically funny movie like say any of Judd Apatow's films.To me, it looked more of a humorous kind of film. To be honest, with a few edits/changes, this would've easily been a family-type movie.I got some laughs out of it though. I liked it for the performances. In my opinion, I thought Steve Carell and Paul Rudd wereequally great with their roles. Their chemistry is always spot on. The director who made this film made ""Meet the Parents"" and I kind of saw that.This movie has the same look and feel as ""MTP"". I think ""MTP"" is funnier, but I still enjoyed ""Schmucks"", very much.A lot of people didn't like this movie. I can see why and respect that.

1393881,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B004AV5GX6,Jason,"[5, 9]","This movie had a choice to make going in. Either jump off the deep end, make a mockery of everything, and fearlessly laugh at the uniqueness of others. Revel in the schadenfreude. The other option is to be self righteousness; take the sentimental road not taken by many. Invite the audience to the eponymous dinner for schmucks, even tempt us with snickering and smirks along the way, then entertain us with awkward absurdity during the main course, and then shove the guilty mirror of condescension in our faces.Sadly, the movie takes the latter route, and it never lives up to the lofty, post-Hangover expectations.  Stuck between Apatow and chick-flick is not the safest bet for box office success.Desperate to impress his girlfriend and get a promotion, Tim (Paul Rudd) finds his opportunity through some inside knowledge of an eccentric, foreign multi-millionaire named Mueller (David Williams). To Tim's surprise, he nails his one opportunity with his boss Lance Fender (Bruce Greenwood) by revealing his knowledge of Mueller, and learns of a dirty company secret...the dinner for schmucks. If he brings the biggest idiot to the dinner, he is guaranteed the promotion. Shortly thereafter serendipity delivers into Tim's life a man named Barry (Steve Carell), a talented mouse taxidermist (he creates anthropomorphic Mouseterpieces), a well meaning but awkward imbecile, an utter irritation with impeccably bad timing. Forrest Gump without the charm, good luck, or amiability. Too stupid to be outside of an institution, Barry is a 10-hour family car ride in a cramped VW Bug.Along the way we meet a cast of characters, most importantly Tim's art curator girlfriend Julie (Stephanie Szostak), who looks down upon the dinner's concept and wants Tim to avoid the dinner, bizarre artist Kieran (Jemaine Clement), and fellow invited idiot Therman (Zach Galifianakis).Despite picking up during the absurd dinner, the hearty laughs come unevenly. More childish than funny, Carell basically imitates a navely harmless but nonetheless bothersome child; in other words, he just plays Brick Tamland from Anchorman. Rudd does what Rudd does, nothing more nothing less. Even Galifianakis falls below his standard hilarity. The only refreshing contribution is Clement's completely over the top artist Kieran, who wears a Satyr costume like nobody's business, makes love with models in body paint, and is intriguingly funny. Strange but interesting guy.Take it from me; this meal is a barely palatable, sour and sweet combo.

But if there's one DIRECTOR who knows how to consistently bring sequential chaos to his films, it's Jay Roach.  The man behind the Austin Powers and Meet the Parents trilogies, Roach's talents are the pinnacle of persistent, albeit uneducated, humor.  There's nothing sophisticated about him, but it's difficult to stand by idly and maintain a flat face during pandemonium that is rivaled only by vintage Python.During this (dinner) party, you'll feel stupid.  Let's just get that out of the way immediately.  There are no high brow comedic moments to be found in Dinner for Schmucks.  It sticks to its slapstick strengths, and doesn't wander more than a few steps from said territory throughout.This is a film that is absolutely determined to make you laugh by its principles, and will fight tooth and nail to assure us and itself that these goals are met.  Is it a flawed strategy?  Probably, and it certainly wont make any friends in the movie industry, but funny's funny, straight up; the audience's destination to the laugh rarely matters.That said, this is hardly an excuse for everything.  Indeed, Roach's nutcase of a movie occasionally finds itself floundering under the unpredictability of its own comedy, often indulging in itself so much that it leaves its audience clueless and in the dark.  You'll know these moments when they arise, and it will be a struggle to find the proper emotional response.More often than not, however, the movie hits its mark, relying on viciously quick cuts and the understanding of its lovely cast to set the tone and keep it there.  When all cylinders are blasting in synchronization, the movie's a senseless riot that will crack ribs.It really owes its success to a series of performances that are committed to the cause; given what this movie may or may not represent in the genre - that is, a degradation - that's giving a lot.  Carell's performance here is the stuff of legend, reveling in so many absurdities and peculiar idiosyncrasies - and pulling each one off, no less - that there's simply no stopping the uproars when he's on the screen.  Rudd is quick to join the esoteric group of actors who excel at playing themselves in every performance, and Galifianakis, for what may be the first and last time in his career, finds himself in the presence of even more ridiculous personas.For what it's worth, it all comes together more cohesively than you'd think.  The premise is, ultimately, a gimmick, a one - trick pony, but it's one that goes a long way towards giving you your money's worth in breathless laughs.",3,Dinner for Schmucks,1324166400,"12 18, 2011",2011,2659,"['one', 'man', 'Hollywood', 'who', 'how', 'create', 'ruckus', '.uh', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'one', 'DIRECTOR', 'who', 'how', 'consistently', 'bring', 'sequential', 'chaos', 'films', 'Jay', 'Roach', 'man', 'Austin', 'Powers', 'Meet', 'Parents', 'trilogies', 'Roach', 'talents', 'are', 'pinnacle', 'persistent', 'uneducated', 'humor', 'nothing', 'sophisticated', 'difficult', 'stand', 'idly', 'maintain', 'flat', 'face', 'pandemonium', 'rivaled', 'only', 'vintage', 'Python.During', 'dinner', 'party', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'stupid', 'Let', 'just', 'get', 'way', 'immediately', 'are', 'high', 'brow', 'comedic', 'moments', 'be', 'found', 'Dinner', 'Schmucks', 'slapstick', 'strengths', ""n't"", 'wander', 'more', 'few', 'steps', 'said', 'territory', 'throughout.This', 'film', 'absolutely', 'determined', 'make', 'laugh', 'principles', 'will', 'fight', 'tooth', 'nail', 'assure', 'goals', 'are', 'met', 'flawed', 'strategy', 'Probably', 'certainly', 'wont', 'make', 'friends', 'movie', 'industry', 'funny', 'funny', 'straight', 'up', 'audience', 'destination', 'laugh', 'rarely', 'matters.That', 'said', 'hardly', 'excuse', 'everything', 'Indeed', 'Roach', 'nutcase', 'movie', 'occasionally', 'floundering', 'unpredictability', 'own', 'comedy', 'often', 'indulging', 'so', 'much', 'audience', 'clueless', 'dark', ""'ll"", 'know', 'moments', 'when', 'arise', 'will', 'be', 'struggle', 'find', 'proper', 'emotional', 'response.More', 'often', 'not', 'however', 'movie', 'mark', 'relying', 'viciously', 'quick', 'cuts', 'understanding', 'lovely', 'cast', 'set', 'tone', 'keep', 'there', 'When', 'cylinders', 'are', 'blasting', 'synchronization', 'movie', 'senseless', 'riot', 'will', 'crack', 'ribs.It', 'really', 'success', 'series', 'performances', 'are', 'committed', 'cause', 'given', 'what', 'movie', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'represent', 'genre', 'degradation', 'giving', 'lot', 'Carell', 'performance', 'here', 'stuff', 'legend', 'reveling', 'so', 'many', 'absurdities', 'peculiar', 'idiosyncrasies', 'pulling', 'one', 'off', 'less', 'simply', 'stopping', 'uproars', 'when', 'screen', 'Rudd', 'quick', 'join', 'esoteric', 'group', 'actors', 'who', 'excel', 'playing', 'performance', 'Galifianakis', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'first', 'last', 'time', 'career', 'presence', 'even', 'more', 'ridiculous', 'personas.For', 'what', 'worth', 'together', 'more', 'cohesively', ""'d"", 'think', 'premise', 'ultimately', 'gimmick', 'one', 'trick', 'pony', 'one', 'long', 'way', 'giving', 'money', 'worth', 'breathless', 'laughs']",Dinner for Schmucks

To my surprise, it's a really funny movie.  It reminds me quite a bit of another movie I just saw, Todd Phillips'Due Date.  But more so it's kind of like a remake ofWhat About Bob?-- where an incredibly annoying person insinuates himself into a man's life and turns it upside down (of course in the end teaching him something about himself).I think the reason this movie didn't do as well as it could have is because the trailers focused on the titular party, but it's actually a very small part of the movie.  In fact, aside from two (pretty big) laughs, it's the weakest aspect of the film.The movie focuses on Carell's Barry, a socially isolated, awkward guy who falls into the lap of Rudd's Tim, who's desperate to get ahead in his company, and how Barry causes complete chaos for him.  Barry drives Tim insane with his mangling, but Tim keeps him around because he needs an ""idiot"" for his boss's special dinner and knows Barry is pure gold.Tim's curator girlfriend finds the idea of the dinner repugnant and Tim's involvement plus bungled attempts at being a savior by Barry seemingly drive her right into the buffoonish arms of her biggest artist.The bottom line is really this: If you find Carell's borderline mentally-challenged Barry funny, then you will enjoy this movie.  If you don't, you won't.  The comedy is VERY broad here.  Zach Galifianakis shows up as a coworker of Barry's who claims to be a master of ""mind control.""  Lucy Punch (looking downright Amazonian) is a nightmare one-night stand stalker who terrorizes Rudd's character.I never really thought the film gave Rudd much to do -- he's just a bland, likable guy reacting to the madness.  He doesn't have a disdainful, peevish edge to him the way Robert Downey Jr. did in ""Due Date.""But every time Carell delivered one of his awkward lines -- an arrested-development dunderhead who's as naive as he is misinformed about history -- I laughed.  And that's good enough for me.  The film doesn't feel all that original or especially creative, but it certainly delivers the laughs with a fine comedic performance from its lead.",4,Much better than I thought it would be.,1299888000,"03 12, 2011",2011,2271,"['remember', 'hearing', 'lot', 'negative', 'things', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'friend', 'decided', 'check', 'out', 'anyway', ""'re"", 'fans', 'Carell', 'Rudd', 'surprise', 'really', 'funny', 'movie', 'quite', 'bit', 'movie', 'just', 'saw', 'Todd', ""Phillips'Due"", 'Date', 'more', 'kind', 'remake', 'Bob', 'where', 'incredibly', 'annoying', 'person', 'man', 'life', 'down', 'course', 'end', 'teaching', 'something', 'think', 'reason', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'as', 'well', 'could', 'have', 'trailers', 'focused', 'titular', 'party', 'actually', 'very', 'small', 'part', 'movie', 'fact', 'aside', 'two', 'pretty', 'big', 'weakest', 'aspect', 'film.The', 'movie', 'Carell', 'Barry', 'socially', 'isolated', 'awkward', 'guy', 'who', 'lap', 'Rudd', 'Tim', 'who', 'desperate', 'get', 'ahead', 'company', 'how', 'Barry', 'complete', 'chaos', 'Barry', 'Tim', 'insane', 'mangling', 'Tim', 'around', 'idiot', 'boss', 'special', 'dinner', 'knows', 'Barry', 'pure', 'gold.Tim', 'curator', 'girlfriend', 'idea', 'dinner', 'repugnant', 'Tim', 'involvement', 'bungled', 'attempts', 'being', 'savior', 'Barry', 'seemingly', 'drive', 'right', 'buffoonish', 'arms', 'biggest', 'artist.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'really', 'find', 'Carell', 'borderline', 'mentally-challenged', 'Barry', 'funny', 'then', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'wo', ""n't"", 'comedy', 'VERY', 'broad', 'here', 'Zach', 'Galifianakis', 'up', 'coworker', 'Barry', 'who', 'be', 'master', 'mind', 'control', 'Lucy', 'Punch', 'looking', 'downright', 'Amazonian', 'nightmare', 'one-night', 'stand', 'stalker', 'who', 'Rudd', 'character.I', 'never', 'really', 'thought', 'film', 'gave', 'Rudd', 'much', 'do', 'just', 'bland', 'likable', 'guy', 'reacting', 'madness', ""n't"", 'have', 'disdainful', 'peevish', 'edge', 'way', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'did', 'Due', 'Date', 'time', 'Carell', 'delivered', 'one', 'awkward', 'lines', 'arrested-development', 'dunderhead', 'who', 'as', 'naive', 'misinformed', 'history', 'laughed', 'good', 'enough', 'film', ""n't"", 'feel', 'original', 'especially', 'creative', 'certainly', 'laughs', 'fine', 'comedic', 'performance', 'lead']",Dinner for Schmucks

So, of course, Dinner for Schmucks would eventually have to hit my orbit.The premise held great promise. And the dinner party itself had terrific moments of all out quirk and bizarre. Almost worth the price of the rental. And there was a sweetness that Carrell channeled. His character is inept and intense all rolled into one wacky guy with some serious relational dysfunctions.Barry (Carell)has quirk...my favorite was his defense mechanism. When being hit (which is actually pretty often throughout the film) he plays dead. Amusing. And one scene with Rudd's character, Tim, was laugh out loud funny as he tried to explain to his girlfriend that he was being the him she didn't know via some snappy dialogue.Speaking of dialogue, ugh, there's some lameness throughout. The movie relies on adolescent sex humor over cleverness several times. Tim (Rudd) is being stalked by Darla and Barry (Carell) ends up causing that situation to explode. There's an awkward few scenes where Darla is a Tim-hungry woman intent on seducing whomever will get her to Tim. Way too long scene. And then there is Barry's boss who has a certain control over Barry. Another awkward scene with the multi-use of clinical term for a female body part. Finally, a (throw up in my mouth) sexy artist who really, really gets into his work.

Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[1, 4]","This warm attempt at a traditional big-hearted comedy has its awkward moments, but it's a generally positive attempt to make people laugh through silliness.  Moreover, it uses the Marx Brothers' classic outsider ethos, throwing its sympathy behind misfits and oddballs instead of the people who want you to know they're too cool for the room.  This creates a rebellious tone we see too seldom in this age of slick hipsterism.Tim (Paul Rudd) wants in with the in crowd at his cutthroat office, and his boss reveals what that takes: joining his weekly exhibitionistic dinner where the well-heeled mock eccentrics, cranks, and humbugs.  Tim runs quite literally into Barry (Steve Carrell), who makes mice dioramas and misunderstands subtle social cues.  But Tim's promotion may kill his romance with Julie (Stephanie Szostak).  So Tim and Barry coach the eccentrics to rebel.Rudd wings straight lines at Carrell, who returns strange zingers and non-sequiturs.  It's mostly in good fun, except occasional scenes that suggest attempted rape is funny if a woman victimizes a man, or that dismemberment is funny if the victim is established as scummy.  These lapses in taste do bring the tone down, but overall, this movie maintains an optimistic, playful feel as Rudd and Carrell wind each other up.On the whole, this generally okay comedy will not change the cinema landscape much.  It provides an all-star comedy cast an opportunity to push each other to the next level, and it certainly won't harm anybody's career.  I'd call this a straightforward, brainless evening's entertainment.

1393899,A2912N2K91AP8Z,B004AV5GX6,L. C. Marshall,"[5, 10]","This must be described as what I would call a ""painful"" comedy--you know, the kind where  the audience spends time laughing nervously at the increasingly painful plight of the hero.  Average entries in this category inspire nothing more than this jittery laughter.  Really good entries transcend the nervous wincing of the audience to develop genuine belly-laughs and group groans when the audience reaches the point where it almost can't stand it anymore.  Dinner for Schmucks is a member of the second category.  It is an exceptionally good ""painful"" comedy.The story centers around young man who is an analyst in a financial services company specializing in buying companies and divesting their assets.  He gets an opportunity to advance in his company--if he brings the best ""village idiot"" to a dinner sponsored by his boss where the objective is to have the biggest laugh possible at a group of unsuspecting dinner guests brought by members of the company.The hero, played by Paul Rudd, gets far more than he bargained for when he stumbles across an obsessive mouse taxidermist, played by Steve Carrell, and decides to take him to his boss' dinner. In the process, the taxidermist manages to nearly destroy the young man's life by losing him his girlfriend,losing his job, getting him audited, and attaching a deranged female stalker to him.  The increasing amount of pain for young Tim (Rudd) is palpable and reaches a point where the entire audience in the theater I was at groaned loudly and in unison.  The audience reaction was a really funny part of the movie for me.I must admit that as the pain was heaped higher and higher, I came within a hair's breadth of walking out, and despite the laughs peppered liberally throughout the show, I found my self wondering how much longer the thing could continue.  I'm glad that I toughed it out, because the hilarious climax and denouement of the show are more than worth it.The movie was directed by the same director who filmed ""Meet the Parents.""  Frankly, this show is a considerably better effort.  I only found out about the director after the movie.  Given my dislike for ""Meet the Parents,""  I doubt I would have gone had I known the director in advance.  However, in this film, Jay Roach does a wonderful job of building the misery of the audience to release it in the comedic climax at the end.There are a number of memorable characters in the movie.

To my delight & surprise, it turned out to be a cute, funny, & well-acted film that deserves much more acclaim than it's getting on this site.First of all, whoever did the casting for this movie deserves a big credit for any success this movie gets.  I don't recall ever raving about the cast - let alone a FANTASTIC SUPPORT CAST but it's worthy of a big mention here.  Steve (Barry) & Paul (Tim) put in a fine performance but the supporting cast really helped to carry this movie to an even higher level.  Lucy Punch who played the stalker girlfriend really sank her teeth into her role as did Jemaine Clement who played Kieran the artist and of course Zach is never funnier as when he's trying to look serious.  I've always enjoyed Larry Wilmore & Kristen Schaal and they didn't disappoint here either.  There are so many more I want to mention but I don't remember all their names but some faces were very familiar.  They all did a wonderful job and Steve & Paul also deserve kudos for allowing the other cast members to steal the spotlight in many scenes as that kind of sharing made the movie that much more enjoyable & hilarious.  Thank God this movie wasn't just an ego ride for these two stars.The mice and the dioramas were too cute and adorable.  Heck, even THAT added to my overall enjoyment of this movie!  I also knew I enjoyed the heck out of this movie when I watched every single second of the Special features just so I could keep this feel good mood going for a little bit longer.Don't get me wrong, we're not talking rocket science here this is a comedy after-all.  But I sat down to this movie not expecting much yet I got my funny-bone tickled and when the credits rolled, I was disappointed the movie had already ended.  I wasn't finished watching & wondering what other collaborations Barry & Kieran would come up with and succeed at!Lucy Punch and Jemaine Clement, who are you and where have you been all my cinema life?!  Heck, I kept thinking Nick Kroll WAS Jemaine Clement until I saw Paul Rudd doing an interview where he picked on Jemaine for the way his name was spelled.

Julie is Tim's girlfriend. Tim has proposed to her twice, but has yet to receive a definite answer. I'll restrain myself from releasing the full plot, but the reason the movie is titled ""Dinner for Schmucks"" is because the movie involves inviting schmucks (SLANG- NOUN: incompetent, obnoxious, contemptible person)  over for dinner. The goal of the invitation is to see who is the biggest schmuck of them all. A competition of schmucks.

Paul Rudd befriends him with an ulterior motive, to invite him to the title dinner to impress his boss - but humiliating him in the process. But even before the dinner, Carell, trying to helpful, creates a series of  misunderstandings that mess up Rudd's relationships. This makes up the bulk of the movie and is very funny, if typical comedic misunderstandings, well staged with good comic timing.

He concocts a great money-making idea and is tentatively welcomed ""upstairs"" to where the offices are much nicer and the salaries much bigger.  But to be fully embraced in the club of executives, he must attend a dinner hosted by his boss (Bruce Greenwood).  At this dinner, each guest is asked to bring along someone ""extraordinary""...a person who can be mocked as an idiot.  Preferably somebody self-deluded about his abilities or simply incredibly dim-witted.Rudd is horrified, as is his girlfriend, an art gallery owner who ostensibly has no interest in big business, money, the trappings of a rich lifestyle, etc.  But when he accidentally runs his car into Steve Carrell, it is as though fate is handing him the perfect dinner guest.  Carrell is an IRS agent who has failed to recover from his wife ditching him for his boss, and who is sublimating all this grief into the creation of large, incredibly detailed miniature ""scenes"" (think The Last Supper or Benjamin Franklin flying his kite) wherein dead mice in costumes are the people.  Carrell has amazing creative and taxidermy skills...but he's also nave, clueless, clumsy and a clinger.  Rudd invites him to the dinner, but when Carrell misunderstands the date and time, the two men end up together for a very long, frantic and disastrous day.Most of the movie does NOT involve the titular DINNER...which is probably a good thing.  When the dinner does begin, I would say it is among the more sloppy moments of the film.  The idiots who are introduced and paraded in front of us are wildly unconvincing as real people, not terribly funny and the scene is allowed to devolve into frantic running around, with plates breaking and fires blazing.  It's like the climactic scene to a farce...except that farces have to be carefully constructed from the beginning in order for the chaos to actually be a payoff.  DINNER FOR SCHMUCKS starts us down that road, but then takes an hour long diversion as Rudd & Carrell have their own adventures.Carrell & Rudd are so charming and skilled at playing off each other that the vast majority of the film is simply hilarious.  It should NOT work as well as it does...the scenes are often contrived and no one behaves terribly logically, even within the confines of the film.  But the fact is, I laughed my rear-end off...and that's almost good enough for me.  Carrell gives his idiot a real heart and real pain...he is simultaneously touching and aggravating.  No one can do this as well as Carrell at the moment.  Rudd is his handsome, cynical self.  His character teeters between giving in to his greedy, ""corporate"" side and feeling bad that he's even thinking of improving his lot in life by tearing down others.  No one is better than Rudd at walking this line, so we are able to both root for him and feel disappointed in him at the same time.  Carrell & Rudd have worked together before...and their ease together shows.  What I like about both these actors is that they both are comfortable sharing the laughs and limelight with others.  I don't want to stretch this too far, but have you ever noticed that particular smile of delight that hits Carrell's face when someone else does something funny?  They come in little bursts where we see a big smile and see his eyes twinkle with surprise and admiration.  This allows the viewer to see the human underneath the outlandish character.  Both Carrell and Rudd believe in NOT pushing the comedy...because none of the things happening are supposed to be funny to the character...just the audience.Zach Galifinakis turns up in a strange role as Carrell's boss.  He's only in a few scenes, but he steals them.  Rudd & Carrell LET him steal the scenes...but there is one moment when Galifinakis is laughing at some notion Rudd has articulated, and his clenched laughter and his ever reddening face were absolutely priceless.  The whole audience completely lost it during that 30 second masterpiece.I was very pleased to see FLIGHT OF THE CONCHORDS member Jemaine Clement playing a truly obnoxious artist.  His role is gloriously over-the-top, and thus many will not like it, but I actually found him more grounded than this clich&eacute;d part is usually played.  Normally the typical artist is portrayed as simply strutting around, preening and caring only about himself.  Clement does that, but we also see that he genuinely is able to connect with others, even if it IS in an odd way.  And he gets to wear the BEST minotaur costume ever!The women in the film are given extremely short shrift.  Rudd's girlfriend is as bland as bland can be...and we're also asked to believe that she hates the trappings of corporate America, yet his perfectly okay with living in the most amazing apartment building in a deeply expensive apartment.  This makes her shallow, and thus her protestations to Rudd feel hollow.  Other women are just emasculating weirdoes.Finally, the film wants to have things two ways.  On one hand, it wants to be something of a dark comedy, because the idea of a dinner for idiots is uncomfortable and squirm-inducing.  But it also wants to be a sweeter, off-kilter bromance.  The two do NOT combine very smoothly...and thus the tone of the film bounces around more than I would like.So the film has its ups and downs.  But my enjoyment of the two leads and my laughter levels make this a strong recommendation from me.  No Oscar awards await this film...but it was the funniest film I've seen in several months, if not all year.",4,"Very uneven, but Carrell & Rudd make it HILARIOUS",1280707200,"08 2,

1393937,A3R8PXSFGY9MC2,B004AV5GX6,Spider Monkey,"[0, 0]","`Dinner for Schmucks' is an easy going comedy starring Steve Carrell and Paul Rudd.When Tim (Rudd) goes after a promotion he soon learns that his boss hosts an annual dinner party where each of his staff has to bring an `idiot' guest along with him. The most entertaining guest wins a trophy and the member of staff who brought him wins the promotion. Although Tim is initially appalled by the idea, this soon changes when he meets Barry (Carrell) who is an endearing, but bumbling man who makes assorted dioramas out of stuffed, dead mice. Barry brings chaos, but his own brand of charm, into Tim's life and before long the film is in full swing.Carrell is very good as Barry, who you can't help but like despite his annoying tendencies. He tries so hard to please and although everything falls down around his ears, he acts with the best intentions. I found this a lot funnier than I expected and whilst it doesn't have much sophistication, it more than makes up for this in visual gags and slapstick humour.Some reviewers have given this a rough ride when comparing it to the original, but having not seen the French version I am in no position to judge. I can say however, that taken on it's own merits it is an entertaining enough film and raises enough laughs to warrant being called a comedy. Everyone plays their roles well enough and this is worth watching for the hilarious, quirky and strangely charming mouse dioramas alone. This is good, but not great, but makes for an evenings entertaining viewing.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.",3,Dinner for Schmucks,1304208000,"05 1, 2011",2011,1582,"['Dinner', 'Schmucks', 'easy', 'going', 'comedy', 'starring', 'Steve', 'Carrell', 'Paul', 'Rudd.When', 'Tim', 'Rudd', 'promotion', 'soon', 'boss', 'annual', 'dinner', 'party', 'where', 'staff', 'bring', 'idiot', 'guest', 'most', 'entertaining', 'guest', 'trophy', 'member', 'staff', 'who', 'brought', 'promotion', 'Tim', 'initially', 'appalled', 'idea', 'soon', 'changes', 'when', 'Barry', 'Carrell', 'who', 'endearing', 'bumbling', 'man', 'who', 'assorted', 'dioramas', 'stuffed', 'dead', 'mice', 'Barry', 'chaos', 'own', 'brand', 'charm', 'Tim', 'life', 'long', 'film', 'full', 'swing.Carrell', 'very', 'good', 'Barry', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'annoying', 'tendencies', 'so', 'hard', 'please', 'everything', 'down', 'ears', 'best', 'intentions', 'found', 'lot', 'funnier', 'expected', 'whilst', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'sophistication', 'more', 'up', 'visual', 'gags', 'slapstick', 'humour.Some', 'reviewers', 'have', 'given', 'rough', 'ride', 'when', 'comparing', 'original', 'having', 'not', 'seen', 'French', 'version', 'am', 'position', 'judge', 'can', 'say', 'however', 'taken', 'own', 'merits', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'film', 'enough', 'laughs', 'warrant', 'being', 'called', 'comedy', 'Everyone', 'roles', 'well', 'enough', 'worth', 'watching', 'hilarious', 'quirky', 'strangely', 'charming', 'mouse', 'dioramas', 'alone', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'evenings', 'entertaining', 'viewing.Feel', 'free', 'check', 'out', 'blog', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'profile', 'page']",Dinner for Schmucks

Nice at first and you end up feeling good about it by the time it's over, but it can sure get uncomfortable along the way. The movie is funny. Very funny at times. At other times I feel like pulling  my hair. It's a mixed bag. However when you get down to it I didn't regret watching it and look back remembering the fun stuff more than the stuff I complain about.The movie is a situation comedy. One dude (Paul Rudd) wants to rise up the corporate ladder and one of way of doing it is to get a schmuck for this joke dinner party. Dude finds a schmuck (Steve Carell), who then latches onto him and all sorts of embarrassingly crazy stuff happens. It's similar comedy that you would find in Due Date (maybe it's a Zack Galifianakis thing as he is in both movies). Sometimes it's pretty funny and sometimes you just wish they would quit running the gag as long as they do. In the middle of the movie it's especially exasperating and borders on being painfully droll. There is only so many times (and minutes) I can stand seeing Carell destroy Rudd's life in various little ways.It's when they get off on that kick and move further into the absurdities and quirkiness of the characters that the comedy starts to take off for me. Jemaine Clement as the eccentric artist Kieran gives a refreshingly out of the box performance, Galifianakis' character is weird but gels right in with Carell. Much of the good stuff happens in the beginning and the penultimate ""dinner"" scene at the end of the movie. It's makes it worth the wait when you get there. You get a blind swordsman making funny challenges, a pet psychic talking to the food, even Jeff Dunham married to one of his dummies. There is a fair amount of comedy gold in the rough.The movie is not just all hijinks as the main characters do a little soul searching and maturing throughout the movie. This includes Steve Carell's character getting a little growth along with Rudd's character learning a life lesson suitable for an after school special. The movie is far from perfect, but it does have heart.The Blu-Ray release will be in AVC 16x9 widescreen format in 1080p with audio in 5.1 DTS-HD (dvd will be in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround). Extra features will be the following:The Biggest Schmucks in the World featurette - Interviews from the stars. More of a promotional fluff piece than anything else.""Schmuck Ups"" - Gag reel. Standard stuff like messing up lines and being goofy on the set, but it's funny.Deleted scenes - Kinda funny, but nothing that the movie needed to keep.The Men Behind the Mousterpieces - Self explanatory.

In fact the dinner with the schmucks was very funny, I just wish there had been more of it. Rather than concentrate on what the title of the film would have us believe the movie is about, it takes its time to get there. The movie is about the relationship of Paul Rudd and various people including his gf, ex-gf and Steve Carell, the schmuck he has selected to take to a dinner filled with schmucks. This is a monthly event hosted by his boss.Steve, our schmuck, uses dead mice to make menageries of his life and the history of mankind. He is really a nice guy, who through his stupidity messes up the life of Paul Rudd. The movie makers decided the movie needed a heart warming message that schmucks have feelings too, not thinking that the audience doesn't really care. I think making Paul Rudd attend multiple parties, building up to this one would have been better than the trek these writers took.The movie was funny when it wasn't overly stupid. The reason why we laughed at those Pink Panther movies because there was a sense of possibility in all that stupidity. When you cross that line to no possibility, as this movie sometimes does, it becomes just stupid.Listen carefully to Steve Carell's lines as he mixes up words.

That doesn't mean that Steve Carell (""The Office"")and Zach Galifianakis (""The Hangover"")don't have their entertaining moments. If trimmed to about 80 or 90 minutes ""Dinner for Schmucks"" would have been nearly perfect and if Paul Rudd was given something to play other than a nice guy trying to get ahead, ""Dinner for Schmucks"" could have been a much better movie. Add in the fact that director Jay Roach focuses too much on trying to get us to care for the characters and unfortunately it gets in the way of the comedic antics deflating some of the best moments in the film. Still, ""Dinner for Schmucks"" isn't a BAD movie and has its moments it just doesn't live up to its potential.For those interested in a summary of the plot it's at the end of this review.For those who are interested in such stuff the film receives a nice looking transfer and has some nice extras including the gag reel, deleted scenes and a number of featurettes on the production of the film and one that focuses on the production of the dioramas. They are actually pretty good although there is a unfunny featurette that allows us to meet the various contestants to be the best ""schmuck"".Rudd plays Tim who wants to work his way up the corporate ladder and is given the opportunity to rub elbows with his boss Lance Fender (Bruce Greenwood)at a dinner where the employee that brings the most idiotic, bizarre guest wins kudos and maybe gets that office on the 7th floor. Tim thinks he has found a ringer when he accidently hits Barry (Steve Carell)with his car. Barry an amateur taxidermy takes dead mice and puts them into dioramas representing modern art.I'm sure on paper ""Dinner for Schmucks"" looked like a perfect project for everyone involved but director Jay Roach creates a number of weird and wacky characters and then doesn't allow us to laugh at their wackiness. We could like and care for the characters in a film like ""The Hangover"" for example and still recognize that they were idiots wringing humor out of their situation but here were not given that opportunity and it deflates a promising comedy robbing it of much of its humor.I'd suggest renting ""Dinner for Schmucks"".",3,"""Dinner for Schmucks"" serves up humor in small portions",1294617600,"01 10, 2011",2011,2266,"['Dinner', 'Schmucks', 'great', 'premise', 'film', 'just', ""n't"", 'developed', 'full', 'potential', ""n't"", 'mean', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'Office', 'Zach', 'Galifianakis', 'Hangover', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'entertaining', 'moments', 'trimmed', '80', '90', 'minutes', 'Dinner', 'Schmucks', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nearly', 'perfect', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'was', 'given', 'something', 'play', 'other', 'nice', 'guy', 'trying', 'get', 'ahead', 'Dinner', 'Schmucks', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'Add', 'fact', 'director', 'Jay', 'Roach', 'too', 'much', 'trying', 'get', 'care', 'characters', 'unfortunately', 'way', 'comedic', 'antics', 'deflating', 'best', 'moments', 'film', 'Still', 'Dinner', 'Schmucks', ""n't"", 'BAD', 'movie', 'moments', 'just', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'potential.For', 'interested', 'summary', 'plot', 'end', 'review.For', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'such', 'stuff', 'film', 'nice', 'looking', 'transfer', 'nice', 'extras', 'including', 'gag', 'reel', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'number', 'featurettes', 'production', 'film', 'one', 'production', 'dioramas', 'are', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'unfunny', 'featurette', 'meet', 'various', 'contestants', 'be', 'best', 'schmuck', '.Rudd', 'Tim', 'who', 'work', 'way', 'corporate', 'ladder', 'given', 'opportunity', 'rub', 'elbows', 'boss', 'Lance', 'Fender', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'dinner', 'where', 'employee', 'most', 'idiotic', 'bizarre', 'guest', 'wins', 'kudos', 'maybe', 'office', '7th', 'floor', 'Tim', 'found', 'ringer', 'when', 'accidently', 'Barry', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'car', 'Barry', 'amateur', 'taxidermy', 'dead', 'mice', 'dioramas', 'representing', 'modern', 'art.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'paper', 'Dinner', 'Schmucks', 'looked', 'perfect', 'project', 'everyone', 'involved', 'director', 'Jay', 'Roach', 'number', 'weird', 'wacky', 'characters', 'then', ""n't"", 'allow', 'laugh', 'wackiness', 'could', 'like', 'care', 'characters', 'film', 'Hangover', 'example', 'still', 'recognize', 'were', 'idiots', 'wringing', 'humor', 'situation', 'here', 'were', 'not', 'given', 'opportunity', 'promising', 'comedy', 'robbing', 'much', 'humor.I', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'renting', 'Dinner', 'Schmucks']",Dinner for Schmucks
