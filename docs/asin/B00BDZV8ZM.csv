It is based upon actual events that occurred in Arleta, CA in 1985.  Some of the names have been changed but the events are pretty close to what happened.  Tiffani-Amber Thiessen (a gorgeous, talented actress) plays the part of ""Jenny Monroe""...the victim's real name was Michele Avila, known as Missy to her family and friends.  She is portrayed as a sweet, fun-loving girl with a big heart.  She is a brunette beauty with curves in all the right places.  She is noticed by men wherever she goes.  Unfortunately, this will be the reason for her demise.  She has two childhood friends, girls who develop an intense hatred and envy of Jenny/Missy as they enter their teenage years.  Patty Duke shines in her role as the victim's mother in this riveting drama...viewers will feel the rage, despair, and pain that Mrs. Avila most likely felt in real life.  The two actresses playing Avila's friends/killers are stellar in their performances.  Thiessen (most commonly known as Kelli Kapowski in ""Saved By the Bell"") steals the show as the pretty girl whose life is cut short by her jealous friends.A truly sad story and excellent acting...as another reviewer noted, it is definitely worth watching.  It shows how evil some people can be, how indifferent to human life.",5,Keep your friends close and your enemies closer...,1391126400,"01 31, 2014",2014,1369,"['was', 'kid', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'TV', 'back', 'day', 'when', 'Lifetime', 'showed', 'truly', 'great', 'movies', 'based', 'actual', 'events', 'occurred', 'Arleta', 'CA', '1985', 'names', 'have', 'been', 'changed', 'events', 'are', 'pretty', 'close', 'what', 'happened', 'Tiffani-Amber', 'Thiessen', 'gorgeous', 'talented', 'actress', 'part', 'Jenny', 'Monroe', 'victim', 'real', 'name', 'was', 'Michele', 'Avila', 'known', 'Missy', 'family', 'friends', 'portrayed', 'sweet', 'fun-loving', 'girl', 'big', 'heart', 'brunette', 'beauty', 'curves', 'right', 'places', 'noticed', 'men', 'Unfortunately', 'will', 'be', 'reason', 'demise', 'two', 'childhood', 'friends', 'girls', 'who', 'develop', 'intense', 'hatred', 'envy', 'Jenny/Missy', 'enter', 'teenage', 'years', 'Patty', 'Duke', 'shines', 'role', 'victim', 'mother', 'riveting', 'drama', 'viewers', 'will', 'feel', 'rage', 'despair', 'pain', 'Mrs.', 'Avila', 'most', 'likely', 'felt', 'real', 'life', 'two', 'actresses', 'playing', 'Avila', 'friends/killers', 'are', 'stellar', 'performances', 'Thiessen', 'most', 'commonly', 'known', 'Kelli', 'Kapowski', 'Saved', 'Bell', 'show', 'pretty', 'girl', 'life', 'cut', 'short', 'jealous', 'friends.A', 'truly', 'sad', 'story', 'excellent', 'acting', 'reviewer', 'noted', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'how', 'evil', 'people', 'can', 'be', 'how', 'indifferent', 'human', 'life']",A Killer Among Friends

I also saw interviews with the murdered girl's mother.  She appeared on several talk shows that included conversations with one of the murderers - Karen Severson - from prison.  The movie is very well made and Patty Duke's acting is especially superb (as usual).This story is a reminder that people are not always what they seem, and that there is no limit to the evil that can result from jealousy.  After killing Missy Avila, one of the murderers, Karen Severson actually moved into the victim's home, pretending to find the killer, when what she really wanted was to watch (and enjoy) the victim's mother suffer.
