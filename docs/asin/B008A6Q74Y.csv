I mean who really gives a hoot about beach volleyball? This is the worst thing I have ever bought from Amazon, NBC need to hang their collective heads in shame.As I am a British ex-pat living in the US I do own a multi-region DVD player so I guess I have to go and buy the BBC version.Please don't waste your money on this junk, NBC don't deserve to make any money out of this.BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD",1,BAD BAD BAD BAD and BAD,1352937600,"11 15, 2012",2012,697,"['am', 'outraged', 'garbage', 'presented', 'here', 'NBC', 'pre-ordered', 'will', 'never', 'do', 'so', 'again', 'was', 'hoping', 'see', 'opening', 'closing', 'ceremony', 'ruined', 'when', 'shown', 'live', 'get', 'couple', 'minutes', 'hey', 'do', 'get', 'beach', 'volleyball', 'final', 'mean', 'who', 'really', 'hoot', 'beach', 'volleyball', 'worst', 'thing', 'have', 'ever', 'bought', 'Amazon', 'NBC', 'need', 'hang', 'collective', 'heads', 'shame.As', 'am', 'British', 'ex-pat', 'living', 'US', 'do', 'own', 'multi-region', 'DVD', 'player', 'so', 'guess', 'have', 'go', 'buy', 'BBC', 'version.Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'money', 'junk', 'NBC', 'do', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'make', 'money', 'this.BAD', 'BAD', 'BAD', 'BAD', 'BAD', 'BAD', 'BAD']",N/A

1549275,AEM0O1B4O9KP0,B008A6Q74Y,"Brian Shaw ""bshaw20""","[8, 8]","So I bit the bullet and purchased this set.  First of all the packaging is flimsy and it did not have any inserts, and the first disc was not in the holder when I opened it up.  I didn't pop in the first disc, but started with the second as that has the special features, swimming, gymnastics, and track footage.First of all since this is a blu ray it is in widescreen HD and not like, the 4:3 or full screen.Now on to the special features - that's all they can come up with after all the fluff that aired on TV??  One on Phelps, and Walsh-May, and then some brief clips of so-called ""women of team USA"" but only showed the crew, a brief women's basketball recap, and a way too short women's soccer recap.  That's it for women of team USA, apparently.They also had the entire Walsh-May gold medal winning game,  although I did not watch it so not sure if it was edited or not.I did not watch the swimming portion but I watched the gymnastics footage.  There is no fluff included in here as well.  They did have the intros to the men's team, and as well as the women's team but that's all they had.  As far as the events they showed several dudes which I never really bothered with.For the women's side, the events are broken down as follows:1.  Team qualifications - did not show a lot of the events, for example only showed one of McKayla's vaults, and also cut out the fluff pieces.  It was also heavily edited.  They also showed Aly's interview at the end.2.  Team final - focused on US events of course, heavily edited, only showing portions of the performances.  It had McKayla's vault, and then the other girls performances as well but some were cut, only portions of Gabby's floor, and portions of Jordyn's bars were shown.  I think Kyla's beam was edited too.  No team reactions and interactions are shown.  The whole Aly floor was shown however as that is the clincher, and they showed the medal ceremony and national anthem.  They cut portions of the scoreboard watching and played some weird score in the background.3. All around final - focused on the US women too, but showed some of the Russian, Chinese, and Romanian contenders.  Medal ceremony ommited the anthem.4.  Event Finals - they included McKayla's botched vault, but not the ""unimpressed"" medal ceremony, and also had Aly's beam routine and the protest which awarded her the bronze, and then the entire floor in which she won the gold.That is all that they had and it faded to black.UPDATE: I finally popped in the first disc and it was the ultimate in ridiculousness.  They aired the prologue that was shown on TV - but after that we get an extremely truncated opening ceremony, and then 2 minute highlights of each day's winners.  Some sports were like 5 seconds, like say wrestling where they just show the winning takedown, and heck even Gabby's gold medal got like what, 10 seconds.  What a pathetic ""highlight"" reel.  You can skip through the days but that's about it.  I can't belive this was approved.

If you found yourself in that category I have good news.London 2012: Games of the XXX Olympiad the DVD can catch you up with some of the most astonishing camera work you've ever seen. Once the DVD gets into the actual events, be forewarned, things move quickly but they had to considering approximately 4,700 Olympic and Paralympic medals were handed out.I was most impressed with the opening ceremony, directed by Danny Boyle. Boyle (born 20 October 1956) is an English film director and producer, best known for his work on films such as Slumdog Millionaire, Shallow Grave, 127 Hours, 28 Days Later, Sunshine and Trainspotting.I was not alone. Over 24 million viewers watched, making this the largest audience for any British television broadcast since 1996. One of the crowning moments was a spoof with Daniel Craig playing James Bond and the Queen being herself, parachuting in.""She was fun, incredibly game. We had a short space of time and I was a bit grumpy as it was my day off and suddenly I am at the Palace with the queen at her private chamber,"" Craig said. ""'It wasn't supposed to be funny.
