People tend to forget that it's not Allen who were seeing on screen but a made up  character that Allen has created. It's for this reason this film was  verbally bashed by critics and audiences viewers alike upon it's release.  Now of course as with any Allen film, non Allen fans will HATE the movie.  They'll see it as self-indulgent as they see every other Allen picture. And  they'll probably upon reading this review feel they HAVE to give me  unhelpful vote. But for those of us who know something about movies and  appreciate Allen's films this turns out to be a real treat. A very clever  screenplay by Allen(as usual)mixed with Allen's wonderful sense of  direction. I like all the performances in the film:Charlotte Rampling,Tony  Roberts,Jessica Harper,and Marie-Christine Barrault. Beautiful photography  by Gordon Willis shoot in black and white,whichs adds to the  &quot;magic&quot; of the film. And as usually with all Allen films a great  jazz score. I think it would be fair to say that perhaps this film among  all of Allen's others films has aged better than most.

Was this total loser influenced toward homicide by viewing a similar celebrity killing which occurs here? It's a troubling possibility.Putting the issue (and so many Fellini comparisons) aside, writer/director/star Allen uses this unique platform to fire an ascerbic blunderbuss, missing no one in the process. Not the critics who tore to shreds his recent work, or an inconsiderate public constantly importuning him for photo ops and autographs. Not the charity do-gooders begging for any spare time, nor the milling crowds of foghorn-voiced ""New Yawkuhs"" hovering near their golden calf.The worst punishment was reserved for himself: Woody's failings, obsessions, neuroses, self-absorption and fears are laid bare here and mercilessly stomped upon. Even executive producer Jack Rollins gets in his licks in one scene, while  ex-wife Lasser has an uncredited cameo as a pushy secretary.

It not only describes the life and thoughts (meaning the outer respectively inner life) of a celebrated comedy writer, it also gives some ambitious characteristics of the very different types of women to whom the writer is attracted.Despite its brilliant plot, promising attempts and interesting characters, Stardust Memories never really suceeds in becoming a fully entertaining, catching, and complete story.",3,Interesting Descriptions Of Different Types Of Women,974937600,"11 23, 2000",2000,477,"['Stardust', 'Memories', 'one', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'most', 'philosophic', 'movies', 'not', 'only', 'life', 'thoughts', 'meaning', 'outer', 'respectively', 'inner', 'life', 'celebrated', 'comedy', 'writer', 'also', 'ambitious', 'characteristics', 'very', 'different', 'types', 'women', 'whom', 'writer', 'attracted.Despite', 'brilliant', 'plot', 'promising', 'attempts', 'interesting', 'characters', 'Stardust', 'Memories', 'never', 'really', 'becoming', 'fully', 'entertaining', 'catching', 'complete', 'story']",N/A
155337,A20IIR0422G3A5,0792846125,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[7, 10]","`Stardust Memories', written and directed by Woody Allen, is often considered one of his lesser movies. I disagree. While it may not be as entertaining as Annie Hall or as `realistic' as `Crimes and Misdemeanors', it seems, like `Zelig', to stand apart from the style of almost all his other movies. The fact that it is one of his most obviously autobiographical is only part of the story. And, as autobiography, it is much more a narrative of his feelings about his movies, his fans, his intellectualism (or lack of it), his girlfriends, and love and death, just to round out all the big topics about life in general and the life of a celebrity in particular.In terms of style, it is probably most similar to `Manhattan', in black and white, with lots of goings on with multiple girlfriends, but unlike `Manhattan' there is much, much more going on here. The rough outline of the story is a trip by a very successful comedy movie writer / director to a weekend festival on the shore, held in a theatre in the Starlight hotel. This very thinly disguised Allen alter ego is beset by fans who alternately adore his work and complain that they liked his earlier, funnier movies much better than his later films.In the snippets of films being screened, we see `homages' to the styles of Fellini (or Bergman?), Gene Kelly, and Alfred Hitchcock (What are the odds that the lead character's name `Sandy Bates' is copied from `Psycho' character, Norman Bates). This is obviously a reflection of the fact that by this time, Allen had parodied Russian novels (`Love and Death'), South American revolutions (`Bananas'), science fiction (`Sleepers'), and Bogart movies (`Play It Again, Sam'). He will go on to parody Shakespeare (`A Midsummer's Night Sex Comedy'), German impressionism (`Shadows and Fog'), and gangster movies (`Bullets over Broadway').I think it is significant that the female lead in this movie is Charlotte Rampling rather than any of his usual leads such as Diane Keaton or Mia Farrow, as I suspect that in a way, Rampling is literally playing a part based on Keaton or Farrow. If this is so, it does not explain the roles of Marie Christine Barrault, a vaguely Ingrid Bergmanesque European actress with two young children or Jessica Harper's role as the women in a couple of fans with whom Allen's character `Bates'. I must say, at this point, that Rampling can do a lot worse than to be remembered for her role in this movie rather than my other memory of her as the gratingly egocentric girl in `Georgy Girl'. There are scenes in this movie where she is simply luminous. Unfortunately, this doesn't explain the appearance of frequent Allen costar Tony Roberts as literally himself, or a character virtually identical to the actor, Tony Roberts.While the analogy may be something of a stretch, I think that if there is any film of which this movie is imitating, it is Fellini's `La Dolce Vita'. Like almost all Allen's parody / homages, the parallel between Allen's movie and the paradigm is always pretty loose. Usually, it is only a hint of style and a few basic plot elements. Like Marcello in Fellini's movie, Sandy Bates seems to be detached from events that are strung together in a very episodic manner. There is even a very Felliniesque (or even Shakespearean) melding of images and reality when the ending of the movie elides into the opening scene which turns out to be a clip from Bates latest `serious' movie.With the exception of `Blazing Saddles' and `Young Frankenstein', I always had a higher regard for Allen's parodies than those by Mel Brooks. Brooks' gags always seemed to be just too easy, with absolutely no regard for logic or continuity. One could probably write a very serious essay comparing Brooks use of the absurd with Allen's techniques. Just compare the queue of heavies (KKK robes, Nazi uniforms, etc) lining up to sign on to the lynch mob in `Blazing Saddles' with the absurdity of Sandy Bates being dead by a fan followed by Bates observing his fans' presenting him with a posthumous award and the whole incident turning out to be a dream.And, with all this, the movie is still funny!I have not yet read a book on philosophy in Allen's films, but I would bet that this film will have an important place in that work. Among other things, Allen tackles his relation to intellect. In interviews, he often downplays the intellectual content of his movies and statements such as his famous quote `90% of life is just showing up'. In a sense, Allen is certainly not an `intellectual' filmmaker in the same vein as Fellini, Kurasawa, Wells, or Kubrick, as many of his movies can be seen as relatively easy parodies with a bit more realism and a much lower budget than similar movies by Mel Brooks. And yet, Allen's movies always have greater rewatchability for me than all but the very greatest comedies such as `Blazing Saddles', `Ghostbusters', `Animal House', and `Dr. Strangelove'. I enjoy comedies leading with Billy Crystal or Tom Hanks, but I buy Woody Allen movies.Highly recommended among the top third of Allen's movies.",5,Excellent Rewatchable Woody.

155340,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,0792846125,California Dreaming,"[0, 0]","Since the elephant is in the room, we may as well discuss it.  It's big, it's fat, and it just gets in the way of getting things done.  We aren't talking about Chris Christie -- although of course we could be, since it looks like parts of this film were shot in New Jersey perhaps -- but rather about Woody Allen and his past.I give nothing away about Mr. Allen's life when I write that there has been much controversy for him, especially lately.  For some reason, members of his family have chosen this point in time to attack him again.  Let me say this:  while I'm a big fan of his movies -- I have seen almost every one now -- that doesn't mean that I will automatically take sides.  I am ambivalent, because I wasn't there and I don't know what happened.  Speculation from the outside doesn't have much meaning.""Why are you even bringing this up in a review?"" you might wisely be asking.  Well, there are several places in this film that actually discuss daughters' relationships with their fathers, in very inappropriate ways.  There is ""art"" on the wall, where it's really just lettering that reads something like ""Fathers who have sex with their daughters"" -- you can't read all the text, but you can surely see the writing on the wall.  And one of Mr. Allen's love interests here -- there are very many, almost too many to count -- discusses an inappropriate relationship that she had with her father when young.Naturally, watching this film now (2014Feb23, or last night) adds even more context to this story.  I'm guessing that, if Mr. Allen could go back in time, he would either not make this film at all, or he would just drastically change screenplay elements here that feel a little too close to home.  While this film must be certainly autobiographical with regards to his relationship with film critics, I'm sure he didn't intend these additional issues.I watched most of a very good documentary about Mr. Allen's life recently, and I believe that at one point he was discussing this film in particular.  He said something like, ""Well, I don't trust anything that anyone says, because whenever anyone comes up to me, he or she only says nice things.""  Pretty ironic really, since while that may be true, when people want to be cowards and just write about him from afar, they seem to only take cheap shots.  Yes, perhaps even worse than my shots above about Mr. Christie.  (Saying that Mr. Allen ""married his daughter"" is of course an intentional lie to deceive.  I believe that she was adopted, and so people need to be really specific with their wording to be more clear about that.  And yes, I think that while he wasn't wise with his choices, he wasn't breaking laws with his actions.  If you don't like it, change the law is all that I will say.)What is also ironic:  I believe that Mr. Allen made this film partly in response to critics who said his films weren't funny anymore.  The funniest scene here, at least to me:  aliens come down and say that even THEY like his older movies because those films were funny.

155343,A315K47GRB024C,0792846125,Daniel C. Markel,"[1, 1]","This review is for the 2000 MGM DVD.The synopsis of this film is that a director named Sandy Bates (Woody Allen), a successful comedy filmmaker, decides to go into a different direction and make ""serious"" movies.  His latest project is in chaos so he is coerced into attending a film festival featuring his earlier comedies. The weekend is a mix of bizarre and awkward encounters with his most loyal fans while trying to find love with three different women.The opening scene in a train parallels Fellini's opening scene in ""8-1/2"" where the director is trapped in a car, and later there are more similarities.  Whether this movie intended to lampoon ""8-1/2"" or just take a stab at art films in general can be debated ad nauseum.  Personally, I think it's the later.  One thing I really enjoyed the most about this film was the social commentary about how fans treat their most admired idol.  True to life, celebrities are many times put in no-win situations where they have no choice but to suck up to their fan base no matter how obnoxious or demanding they come across.  At times, Allen's comedy in this picture is humanly cruel since it relies so much on bad looking people.  The movie does have an adequate amount of funny moments, perhaps the funniest is his dialogue with some space aliens who talk with New York Yiddish accents.  As in most of his films, Allen uses a lot of wonderful vintage jazz and American songbook standards to accentuate some of the scenes in this film. For me, the part that didn't work in this movie were his relationships with three different women.  A significant portion of the movie was devoted to those relationships, and none of it was funny, emotionally touching, nor even interesting, and for that reason, it's really only a very good movie.Perhaps the genius of this movie is that it is so ambiguous that anyone who sees it walks away with a different interpretation of Allen intended to say.  If this was a commentary about art films, then one could then argue it became the movie it tried to satirize.  I vividly recall when this movie came out that it wasn't at all well received - including his loyal fans, but especially from the established movie critics who thought that this movie committed heresy by attacking art films.  After watching a fair share of art films over the years including Fellini's 8-1/2, I actually appreciate this film a lot more and even applaud this film for taking some shots at the art theater crowd who at times can come across as the most pompous and self-absorbed people walking on the face of the earth.The DVD quality is excellent.  The B&W; transfer is virtually pristine.  The sound was excellent too.  The disc gives you the option of fullscreen or widescreen.  Unfortunately there were no bonuses except a trailer.  A commentary by Allen on this film would be priceless.Movie: B-DVD Quality: A",4,Woody Allen's most daring project reaps fascinating results.,1132963200,"11 26, 2005",2005,2875,"['review', '2000', 'MGM', 'DVD.The', 'synopsis', 'film', 'director', 'named', 'Sandy', 'Bates', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'successful', 'comedy', 'filmmaker', 'go', 'different', 'direction', 'make', 'serious', 'movies', 'latest', 'project', 'chaos', 'coerced', 'attending', 'film', 'festival', 'featuring', 'earlier', 'comedies', 'weekend', 'mix', 'bizarre', 'awkward', 'encounters', 'most', 'loyal', 'fans', 'trying', 'find', 'love', 'three', 'different', 'women.The', 'opening', 'scene', 'train', 'parallels', 'Fellini', 'opening', 'scene', '8-1/2', 'where', 'director', 'trapped', 'car', 'later', 'are', 'more', 'similarities', 'movie', 'intended', 'lampoon', '8-1/2', 'just', 'take', 'stab', 'art', 'films', 'general', 'can', 'be', 'debated', 'ad', 'nauseum', 'Personally', 'think', 'later', 'One', 'thing', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'film', 'was', 'social', 'commentary', 'how', 'fans', 'treat', 'most', 'admired', 'idol', 'True', 'life', 'celebrities', 'are', 'many', 'times', 'put', 'no-win', 'situations', 'where', 'have', 'choice', 'suck', 'up', 'fan', 'base', 'matter', 'how', 'obnoxious', 'demanding', 'come', 'times', 'Allen', 'comedy', 'picture', 'humanly', 'cruel', 'so', 'much', 'bad', 'looking', 'people', 'movie', 'have', 'adequate', 'amount', 'funny', 'moments', 'perhaps', 'funniest', 'dialogue', 'space', 'aliens', 'who', 'talk', 'New', 'York', 'Yiddish', 'accents', 'most', 'films', 'Allen', 'lot', 'wonderful', 'vintage', 'jazz', 'American', 'songbook', 'standards', 'accentuate', 'scenes', 'film', 'part', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'movie', 'were', 'relationships', 'three', 'different', 'women', 'significant', 'portion', 'movie', 'was', 'devoted', 'relationships', 'none', 'was', 'funny', 'emotionally', 'touching', 'even', 'interesting', 'reason', 'really', 'only', 'very', 'good', 'movie.Perhaps', 'genius', 'movie', 'so', 'ambiguous', 'anyone', 'who', 'away', 'different', 'interpretation', 'Allen', 'intended', 'say', 'was', 'commentary', 'art', 'films', 'then', 'one', 'could', 'then', 'argue', 'became', 'movie', 'tried', 'satirize', 'vividly', 'recall', 'when', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'was', ""n't"", 'well', 'received', 'including', 'loyal', 'fans', 'especially', 'established', 'movie', 'critics', 'who', 'thought', 'movie', 'committed', 'heresy', 'attacking', 'art', 'films', 'watching', 'fair', 'share', 'art', 'films', 'years', 'including', 'Fellini', '8-1/2', 'actually', 'appreciate', 'film', 'lot', 'more', 'even', 'applaud', 'film', 'taking', 'shots', 'art', 'theater', 'crowd', 'who', 'times', 'can', 'come', 'most', 'pompous', 'self-absorbed', 'people', 'walking', 'face', 'earth.The', 'DVD', 'quality', 'excellent', 'B', 'W', 'transfer', 'virtually', 'pristine', 'sound', 'was', 'excellent', 'too', 'disc', 'option', 'fullscreen', 'widescreen', 'Unfortunately', 'were', 'bonuses', 'trailer', 'commentary', 'Allen', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'priceless.Movie', 'B-DVD', 'Quality']",N/A

155348,A38NMDZZCN1WFP,0792846125,Hume An,"[28, 30]","To me Stardust Memories is Allen's most beautiful and complex film.  It is difficult to express in words the aspects of the film that resonated with me.  If one does not pay close attention, and views the film merely with  one's eyes and brain, one can miss the beauty of the film.  The film is  basically about a successful film director named Sandy (Allen) who is sort  of forced into going to a film festival of his films.  He is very reluctant  to do so because he views festivals as a waste of time, and partially  because the festival mainly showcases his earlier, funnier films which he  is no longer inclined to make.  He, instead, wishes to make more deep,  serious films.  He can no longer make funny films because he is obsessed  with the bigger issues of human suffering, death, and the meaning of life.So far, the character Sandy sounds a lot like Allen who initially made  only funny films, but moved unto weightier topics, and you are right, it  probably is about Allen.  However, through the course of the film, we  realize that Allen is making much more than a simple diclosure.  The film  goes a step further by nesting the movie in Sandy's psyche.  It is  difficult to discern if we are watching a film Sandy made, or watching what  really went on during the film festival, or if we are reliving Sandy's  memories as a young boy who learned magic tricks to impress friends, or  kissed his actress-lover, Dorrie in the rain.Furthermore, the film  forces us, the audience, to ask the same troubling questions about life  that Sandy confronts.  In one scene of the movie, Sandy asks some aliens  (who have very conspicuous  NY accents) why there is so much human  suffering.  They answer back by saying he is asking the wrong questions.  He asks another question--what is the point of living?  The aliens remind  Sandy about his love interests in the past and all of the wonderful times  they shared.  Sandy is dissatisfied with the alien's answers, and the  aliens depart before he can find the answer he wants.  After the aliens  leave, the camera cuts to another scene of three hot air balloons  descending.  In the background some beautiful, old-timey c.a. WWII music is  playing.  The viewer realizes that the aliens were a figment of Sandy's  yearning for concrete answers about life's troubling questions, and must  take the reality of the beautiful image of hot air balloons descending  instead.And I think that this is what the film is about.  It's about us  human beings who do not know and cannot know, really, the answers to the  most troubling questions in life, but we learn to live life by hooking on  to some of the beautiful realities of life.  Whether it is love, beautiful  music, or a film about a thoughtful flounderer searching for unfindable  answers. Allen does not posit the answer to life, but shows quite honestly  that he does not know the answer to life.  He only knows that he loves  people and music and films.Stardust Memories is Allen's gift to us.  It is his offering.

155351,A1C3ZLXDBCQCPC,0792846125,Kenneth E. Wagner Jr.,"[2, 5]","People either seem to love or hate this film.  It is easy to see why.On the one hand, it is full of Woody's usual intelligent yet hilarious one liners.  It is also a very bold and interesting satire on how contemporary America deals with its famous yet intelligent artists.  This is set in the context of an increasingly absurd weekend 'seminar' in which the Woody character shows and comments on his films.  This brings out the zaniness in the audience, really the U.S. film audience.  The comments the film tries to make are indeed profound (how can one make funny movies when one is a depressed person in a depressing world?  what is the point of artistic creation?  when is the line crossed between admiration of an artist and obsession?  can the affluent be happy, or will they create problems?)On the other hand, the film is almost incoherent.  It is supposed to have a dream-like effect, and it hurtles through past and present to try to give life to several sub-plots (noticeably the love story(ies)).  Yet they only acheive a kind of artifical ressucitation.  The film is shot in an over-lighted black and white which has its purpose but really gets on the nerves!One has to give it to Woody, how honest he is in his movies about himself, even the 'scandalous' aspects of his real life.  In this film his lover suspects him of flirting with a 14 year old cousin.  In Deconstructing Harry his sexual 'weakness' causes him to lose his son, his lovers, and almost his freedom.  Even in the more care-free movies like Curse of the Jade Scorpion he hints at his inability to resist young women.The message of many of his films seems to be, yes life is awful, but there is time for love and laughter and we need to focus on this.  The message of this film is essentially the same, as the opening scene of a movie the main character is directing plays: Woody is trapped on a train with sad, depressed losers.  He can see another train, with beautiful winners on it.  He seems to think he belongs on that one, but instead he hurtles to his doom with his assigned lot.  The film however ends with Woody reconciling with his lover on a much happier train.  Of course, then that seems to be another film within a film, and Woody himself leaves the screening looking like he has found little answers, only giving us the happy answer that the public forces on him (and that he, like us all, must to some degree force on ourselves).",3,"Good, but not great",1041897600,"01 7, 2003",2003,2427,"['People', 'seem', 'love', 'hate', 'film', 'easy', 'see', 'one', 'hand', 'full', 'Woody', 'usual', 'intelligent', 'yet', 'hilarious', 'one', 'liners', 'also', 'very', 'bold', 'interesting', 'satire', 'how', 'contemporary', 'America', 'deals', 'famous', 'yet', 'intelligent', 'artists', 'set', 'context', 'increasingly', 'absurd', 'weekend', ""'seminar"", 'Woody', 'character', 'shows', 'comments', 'films', 'out', 'zaniness', 'audience', 'really', 'U.S.', 'film', 'audience', 'comments', 'film', 'make', 'are', 'indeed', 'profound', 'how', 'can', 'one', 'make', 'funny', 'movies', 'when', 'one', 'depressed', 'person', 'depressing', 'world', 'what', 'point', 'artistic', 'creation', 'when', 'line', 'crossed', 'admiration', 'artist', 'obsession', 'can', 'affluent', 'be', 'happy', 'will', 'create', 'problems', 'other', 'hand', 'film', 'almost', 'incoherent', 'supposed', 'have', 'dream-like', 'effect', 'past', 'present', 'try', 'give', 'life', 'several', 'sub-plots', 'noticeably', 'love', 'story', 'ies', 'only', 'acheive', 'kind', 'artifical', 'ressucitation', 'film', 'shot', 'over-lighted', 'black', 'white', 'purpose', 'really', 'nerves', 'One', 'give', 'Woody', 'how', 'honest', 'movies', 'even', ""'scandalous"", 'aspects', 'real', 'life', 'film', 'lover', 'flirting', '14', 'year', 'old', 'cousin', 'Deconstructing', 'Harry', 'sexual', ""'weakness"", 'causes', 'lose', 'son', 'lovers', 'almost', 'freedom', 'Even', 'more', 'care-free', 'movies', 'Curse', 'Jade', 'Scorpion', 'inability', 'resist', 'young', 'women.The', 'message', 'many', 'films', 'be', 'yes', 'life', 'awful', 'time', 'love', 'laughter', 'need', 'focus', 'message', 'film', 'essentially', 'same', 'opening', 'scene', 'movie', 'main', 'character', 'directing', 'plays', 'Woody', 'trapped', 'train', 'sad', 'depressed', 'losers', 'can', 'see', 'train', 'beautiful', 'winners', 'think', 'one', 'instead', 'doom', 'assigned', 'lot', 'film', 'however', 'Woody', 'reconciling', 'lover', 'much', 'happier', 'train', 'course', 'then', 'be', 'film', 'film', 'Woody', 'screening', 'looking', 'found', 'little', 'answers', 'only', 'giving', 'happy', 'answer', 'public', 'forces', 'must', 'degree', 'force', 'ourselves']",N/A
155352,AYCJSA9HR7TKO,0792846125,Kerry Walters,"[2, 2]","There are so many levels to Allen's ""Stardust Memories"" that it seems a slight to his genius as well as an impoverishment of the viewing experience to reduce the film to only one of them.  At one level is the ""existential"" message:  the worries about mortality and meaning that ooze through Allen's films, even the early slapstick ones.  There's the ""Eurofilm"" message, in which Allen pays homage to the thoughtful and experimental films of Bergman and Fellini (rumor has it that Allen thought about calling the film ""4"" on the grounds that it wasn't half as good as Fellini's ""8 1/2"").  But there's also a hint of parody here as well, just the slightest suggestion that perhaps avant garde film makers (and this includes Allen) take themselves a bit too seriously.  There's the exploration of human relationships with three different women--Dorrie (Charlotte Rampling), Daisy (Jessica Harper), and Isobel (Marie-Christine Barrault)--and the suggestion that in love, we're often more attracted to the wounded and broken (Dorrie and Daisy) than the healthy and life-affirming (Isobel).  There's the comedic level, especially in the scenes with the aliens, the sister, and he driver.But for my money, the overarching theme is one of liberation--Allen's liberation as a film maker.  Although he's said that the film isn't autobiographical, and that he shouldn't be confused with the lead character Sandy Bates, these protestations are, of course, nonsense.  Allen's film is in part a nose-thumbing at those fans and critics who demand that he continue making ""funny"" films--that is, all those viewers who think that they have proprietary rights in him and resist any challenge to those rights.  The film is also a rebellion against the studio money men (in this case, chillingly represented by a haughty, supercilious, slightly bored Laraine Newman) for whom all that counts is the bottom line and who also claim proprietary rights.  In short, the film is Woody's declaration of cinematic independence from fans' expectations and film executives' pocket books--but done with undertones of self-deprecation and bittersweetness rather than bravado, as witnessed by a closing scene of Allen staring into an empty theater's blank screen and a tender but bittersweet one of him remembering a Sunday morning with Dorrie.And speaking of Dorrie:  I don't think there's any doubt that the collaboration between Rampling and Allen in ""Stardust"" is sheer cinematic history.  The collage of Dorrie speaking to the camera from the insane asylum, which Allen says was inspired by cubist art, is the film's most memorable scene.In short, a brilliant film.

Sherwin,"[13, 14]","Stardust Memories is a brilliant tribute to Fellini and Bergman that still manages to give us some of that classic Woody Allen humor every so often to lighten things up just a bit. The plot moves along at a good pace and I enjoyed the flashbacks that are interjected so masterfully into the film. The convincing acting held my attention all the way and the black and white footage is very tastefully done.The action begins when overstressed movie director Sandy Bates (Woody Allen) is pushed into attending a two day film festival in his honor. At the festival they show his ""funny films;"" and Bates is lauded for that by his adoring--and endlessly pestering--fans who want many more comedies from Bates. Trouble is, however, that Sandy Bates no longer wants to make funny movies. Instead, he now prefers to make artistic, meaningful movies that reflect the human condition--or perhaps Sandy may even want to quit the film industry altogether and go into some type of profession in which he can help other people.There are not one, not two, but three women in Sandy's life. His relationship with his former lover Dorrie (Charlotte Rampling) is portrayed very well in flashbacks; and his current romance with Isobel (Marie-Christine Barrault) is a bit shaky at times but it's still ongoing. Sandy also flirts with another woman he meets at the film festival; he likes Daisy's (Jessica Harper) artistic and sensitive qualities.Look for excellent performance by Tony Roberts who plays himself; and Helen Hanft plays Vivian Orkin, the ""MC"" of the film festival.Overall, if you've seen Fellini's 8 1/2, you're going to appreciate this film more than if you haven't. At the same time, however, other people will still get a lot out of this even if they haven't seen 8 1/2.

""Two areas in which I am an absolute expert,"" he slyly adds.  I am so glad Woody included this line.  I was just thinking that this film falls neatly into both categories.Oh yes, it is definitely artful.  The lush black and white, used so wonderfully in ""Manhattan"", makes a return engagement here (courtesy of cinematographer Gordon Willis, who again does fine work).  Sure, filming in black and white in an era of colour photography can be construed as a tad pretentious, but Woody never lets that get in the way.  He strips things down so completely, that you can't help but become engaged with the characters and the issues he's presenting.  It's a fine artistic conceit, one that works beautifully.  There's a certain surreal quality to the proceedings here, amplified by the jumbled film-with-a-film-within-a-film-within-a-dream-sequence structure.  Patience will allow the understanding viewer to make sense of the narrative quite easily.  Don't be put off by the art.And sure, the film's themes are highly masturbatory.  Can you or I relate to the problems of Woody's celebrity?  No, not really.  But I feel like I've been given an accurate backstage pass into his world.  The army of fans and fanatics that constantly torture pure Sandy with their requests and admiration was portrayed beautifully.  There's a definite feeling of claustrophobia that is tangible to the audience, when Woody is barraged by a flurry of autograph pads.The vast supporting cast all do magnificent jobs.  It always startles me how Woody can get such natural (or when he needs it, intentionally artificial) performances from his actors.  Special mention, of course, should be made for his three leading ladies.  Charlotte Rampling as Dorrie, a women who's dynamic only two days of every month and destructive the other twenty-eight, gets the polarities in her character just right.  There's one very Godard-like sequence, where jump cuts and dialogue help her portray her particular insanities.  She is manic and frustrated, both to perfect degrees.  Jessica Harper as Daisy gets to show off many of the same qualities.  But there is a touch or morbidity there that shines through in her acting.  And Marie-Christine Barrault as Isobel, a woman who's just left her husband to be with Woody, is charming and innocent, with just enough superficiality and brains thrown in so that you understand why Sandy falls for her.Although not as out-and-out hilarious as Woody's ""earlier, funnier movies"", ""Stardust Memories"" does have its share of memorable lines (my favourite exchange: ""What do you think the Rolls Royce represented?"" asks one audience member to another after Sandy's latest opus is screened.  ""I think it represented his car,"" comes the befuddled reply).  It also shows a willingness to experiment and push the boundaries of Woody's particular brand of filmmaking, so that an alien landing or an assassination attempt doesn't seem that odd (well, yes they do seem odd, but in the context of the world created, not so much).  It is most definitely artful, and quite certainly masturbatory.  But come to think of it, can't you say that about most Woody Allen movies.  I guess this one just wears those qualities on its sleeve a bit more blatantly.

David Roe,"[77, 86]","Why do I choose to waste these few minutes of my life talking about a movie that few people have ever seen and that fewer still want to resurrect? If you mention a &quot;Woody Allen Film&quot; these days, you're bound to elicit one of a few choice conditioned responses - anything from, &quot;Oh, I like his movies, especially the early, funny ones&quot; or &quot;Is he still making films?&quot;The fact is that Woody Allen is one of the great filmmakers to grace the American cinema. Granted, his films today have lost some of their public lustre due to the travails of his personal life and the unbearable political incorrectness of being Woody. Yet fifty years from now, he will be spoken of without hesitation or apology with names such as Kubrick, Ford, Keaton, Spielberg or Malick  as one of the greats. Some critics realized this more than twenty years ago and have conveniently forgotten it.But &quot;Stardust Memories&quot;, if he never made another film, would insure his place among filmmaking elite. The movie in its time was castigated by critics because it presciently observed them as the high priests of a society which worships culture above art. Culture, of course, changes with the seasons but art is that constant which connects us to each other and the world throughout those changes.  Further, it's release coincided with the death of John Lennon.  The scene where Sandy Bates is shot by a crazed fan was uncomfortably closer to reality than the comic moment it wished to establish.  Great movie, but it's release date just wasn't -- ahem! -- in the stars.&quot;Stardust Memories&quot; is as close to perfect a film as I have ever seen. It borrows the structural approach to its story from Fellini's &quot;8 1/2&quot; but is so true to its own purpose it never seems derivative. It complements the sublime black and white cinematography of Gordon Willis with the patience of a camera that is not afraid to allow subjects to walk in and out of the frame. The camera never feels compelled to chase its subject, nor does the director attempt to artificially superimpose the action of the camera against the actions of the characters. Only in a brief series of jump cuts as we witness Charlotte Rampling telling &quot;us&quot; about her breakdown, do we have &quot;technique&quot; rising above a point of sublimation. And even then the erratic cuts perfectly mirror the emotional instability of the subject. And while I'm on the subject of perfection, the production design of Mel Bourne creates a weekend movie retreat which connects us with a recognition of a lost world we perhaps never knew we'd lost. The splendor of an elegant resort hotel along a 1950's Jersey boardwalk seems in the present day a wistful retreat -- a bit dingy if not slightly tawdry -- a symbol of a promised world once imagined but never quite realized.But every bit equal to the power of the visuals is Allen's remarkable talent for matching period music to sustain mood. Yet I do not wish to speak of the music as the MUZAK. The music here is not used simply to sustain a mood as much as it uses its power to transform the audience into one who lives, for the moment, within the frame. Is there any music with greater power to transmogrify than Django Rinehart's guitar or Louis Armstrong's own version of &quot;Stardust,&quot; which, in the end, shows us that the whole meaning of existence, for which some people search their whole lives, can be glimpsed in a single, ephemeral flicker of a moment.For those who travel in darkness, even the briefest glimmer of stars leaves the memory of the unlighted path.&quot;Stardust Memories&quot; sheds for us that kind of light.",5,Check your prejudices at the door -- this is great cinema!,981676800,"02 9, 2001",2001,3668,"['Why', 'do', 'choose', 'waste', 'few', 'minutes', 'life', 'talking', 'movie', 'few', 'people', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'fewer', 'still', 'want', 'resurrect', 'mention', 'quot', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Film', 'quot', 'days', ""'re"", 'bound', 'elicit', 'one', 'few', 'choice', 'conditioned', 'responses', 'anything', 'quot', 'Oh', 'movies', 'especially', 'early', 'funny', 'ones', 'quot', 'quot', 'still', 'making', 'films', 'quot', 'fact', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'one', 'great', 'filmmakers', 'grace', 'American', 'cinema', 'Granted', 'films', 'today', 'have', 'lost', 'public', 'lustre', 'due', 'travails', 'personal', 'life', 'unbearable', 'political', 'incorrectness', 'being', 'Woody', 'fifty', 'years', 'now', 'will', 'be', 'spoken', 'hesitation', 'apology', 'names', 'such', 'Kubrick', 'Ford', 'Keaton', 'Spielberg', 'Malick', 'one', 'greats', 'critics', 'realized', 'more', 'twenty', 'years', 'ago', 'have', 'conveniently', 'forgotten', 'it.But', 'quot', 'Stardust', 'Memories', 'quot', 'never', 'made', 'film', 'would', 'insure', 'place', 'filmmaking', 'elite', 'movie', 'time', 'was', 'castigated', 'critics', 'presciently', 'observed', 'high', 'priests', 'society', 'culture', 'art', 'Culture', 'course', 'changes', 'seasons', 'art', 'constant', 'other', 'world', 'changes', 'Further', 'release', 'coincided', 'death', 'John', 'Lennon', 'scene', 'where', 'Sandy', 'Bates', 'shot', 'crazed', 'fan', 'was', 'uncomfortably', 'closer', 'reality', 'comic', 'moment', 'wished', 'establish', 'Great', 'movie', 'release', 'date', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'ahem', 'stars.', 'quot', 'Stardust', 'Memories', 'quot', 'close', 'perfect', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'structural', 'approach', 'story', 'Fellini', 'quot', '8', '1/2', 'quot', 'so', 'true', 'own', 'purpose', 'never', 'derivative', 'sublime', 'black', 'white', 'cinematography', 'Gordon', 'Willis', 'patience', 'camera', 'not', 'afraid', 'allow', 'subjects', 'walk', 'frame', 'camera', 'never', 'compelled', 'chase', 'subject', 'director', 'attempt', 'artificially', 'superimpose', 'action', 'camera', 'actions', 'characters', 'Only', 'brief', 'series', 'jump', 'cuts', 'witness', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'telling', 'quot', 'quot', 'breakdown', 'do', 'have', 'quot', 'technique', 'quot', 'rising', 'point', 'sublimation', 'even', 'then', 'erratic', 'cuts', 'perfectly', 'mirror', 'emotional', 'instability', 'subject', ""'m"", 'subject', 'perfection', 'production', 'design', 'Mel', 'Bourne', 'weekend', 'movie', 'retreat', 'recognition', 'lost', 'world', 'perhaps', 'never', 'knew', ""'d"", 'lost', 'splendor', 'elegant', 'resort', 'hotel', '1950', 'Jersey', 'boardwalk', 'present', 'day', 'wistful', 'retreat', 'bit', 'dingy', 'not', 'slightly', 'tawdry', 'symbol', 'promised', 'world', 'once', 'imagined', 'never', 'quite', 'realized.But', 'bit', 'equal', 'power', 'visuals', 'Allen', 'remarkable', 'talent', 'matching', 'period', 'music', 'sustain', 'mood', 'do', 'not', 'wish', 'speak', 'music', 'MUZAK', 'music', 'here', 'not', 'used', 'simply', 'sustain', 'mood', 'as', 'much', 'power', 'transform', 'audience', 'one', 'who', 'moment', 'frame', 'music', 'greater', 'power', 'transmogrify', 'Django', 'Rinehart', 'guitar', 'Louis', 'Armstrong', 'own', 'version', 'quot', 'Stardust', 'quot', 'end', 'whole', 'meaning', 'existence', 'people', 'search', 'whole', 'lives', 'can', 'be', 'glimpsed', 'single', 'ephemeral', 'flicker', 'moment.For', 'who', 'travel', 'darkness', 'even', 'briefest', 'glimmer', 'stars', 'memory', 'unlighted', 'path.', 'quot', 'Stardust', 'Memories', 'quot', 'sheds', 'kind', 'light']",N/A

It is a satirical look at the price of fame that is sharply funny about a disillusioned filmmaker who is just about ready to jump off a cliff. Woody plays a famous comedic director Sandy Bates, who is tired of making just funny films and wants to make a serious film about the meaning of life. Federico Fellini masterfully crafted this in his famous 8&1/2, from 1963. In Fellini's great Italian masterpiece, filmmaker Guido, played excellently by Marcello Mastroianni, finds himself at a creative impasse in his career. Stardust Memories picks up from Fellini's film right from the opening scene. Sandy Bates also wants to make a serious film about the meaning of life. Woody's Sandy Bates finds himself at a existential crisis. What & who is he? What has he made of his life and his films? Woody attends a weekend seminar of his films. There he is hounded by fans, groupies, studio-executives, relatives, and both lovers and ex-lovers. Everybody else wants him to focus on making more comedies, while Woody wants to make a serious film. There are many scenes in Stardust Memories that come from both Fellini's masterpiece, as well as from the great Swedish director, Ingmar Bergman. It is a real howl of a film that is a pointed seriocomic look at fame and success. When it first came out in 1980, many less knowledgeable critics dismissed as too self-indulgent. But Stardust Memories has only improved since then. Naturally, only serious cinema-goers will understand the satire and underlying humour. Woody is backed by stars Charlotte Rampling, Jessica Harper, Marie-Christine Barrault, and Tony Roberts. Although only serious film-goers will get all of the humor, it is still a treat and very funny. Give it a chance. You won't be sorry! You have my 4 star guarantee!!

However in that film Fellini chooses Mastroianni to embody his alter ego.Here,it's only Woody, running his hands through Rampling's hair or necking with her.Sandy attends a week-end retrospective of his films where he reflects on the meaninglessness of life,the abyss over which his fragile ego,with frenetic energy, balances.This has a great jazz soundtrack.There are some funny scenes, for instance,at the start where Sandy finds he's on a train of hopelessness,with all the passengers sad and morose,heading nowhere,while on a parallel track there are people laughing,glamorous and happy.Sandy seems to want to join the adjoining train, to get back on track to where he wants to go.He is later plagued by hallucinations of aliens who question why he has changed over from his `earlier funny films'.Allen's great gift is his solemn features holding back his desire to giggle and mock the vanity of the world,he mines the seam of hilarity like a big dipper.In answer to why his films are not more political, Bates says he wishes to keep himself open and flexible to his subject matter.One or two scenes show a younger Sandy learning to do magic tricks on stage.We also get him putting an oven fire out using a fire extinguisher or using a fire extinguisher to get a pigeon out of his house.He cracks a good joke about intellectuals being like the mafia,they get rid of their own. He wishes to make more serious films.Following the early `funny' films,he became more ambitious and intellectual with Annie Hall(1977) and Stardust Memories(1980), being anguished as well as amusing self portraits.The most noted division in Allen's oeuvrebetween the &#34;early funny ones&#34;and the more serious later works,here treated as a running joke, is to split his later films into comedies or straight dramas or a mixture of the two as in Crimes and Misdemeanours,but with a clear dividing line between the two.As a variation of Fellini's 8 ,where the director is the star,treading a line between self indulgence and self expression,his most autobiographical,where the director encounters a creative crisis and ransacks his past for inspiration, Allen in Stardust Memories shows that out of the disorder of his neurosis,comes his gift for making one of his better films.With the retreat of Allen from playing the love interest in his films the one-liner jokes disappear to be replaced by a deepening of character plot and drama.",5,From one-liner comedian to autuer film maker,1387929600,"12 25, 2013",2013,3431,"['Sandy', 'Bates', 'hero', 'Stardust', 'Memories.He', 'nebbish', 'alter', 'ego', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'who', 'making', 'funny', 'films', 'old', 'fans', 'studio', 'executives', 'are', 'trying', 'keep', 'doing.He', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'laugh', 'modern', 'world', 'too', 'much', 'suffering.He', 'photo-realist', 'picture', 'Vietnamese', 'manabout', 'get', 'brains', 'blasted', 'out', 'walls.He', 'drifts', 'love', 'various', 'women', 'French', 'Isobel', 'two', 'children', 'fans', 'who', 'stalk', 'end', 'up', 'bed.He', 'noodles', 'fan', 'Daisy', 'Jessica', 'Harper', 'lifetime', 'love', 'Dorrie', 'Rampling', 'memory', 'greatest', 'films', 'worry', 'other', 'women', 'too', 'long.He', 'plagued', 'pursued', 'fans', 'fame', 'everywhere', 'asking', 'autograph', 'thought', 'having', 'part', 'latest', 'film', 'submitting', 'script.Various', 'charities', 'want', 'backing', 'too', 'seem', 'latch', 'concerns', 'humanity.Of', 'course', 'film', 'made', 'black', 'white', 'homage', 'Fellini', '8', 'However', 'film', 'Fellini', 'Mastroianni', 'embody', 'alter', 'ego.Here', 'only', 'Woody', 'running', 'hands', 'Rampling', 'hair', 'necking', 'her.Sandy', 'attends', 'week-end', 'retrospective', 'films', 'where', 'meaninglessness', 'life', 'abyss', 'fragile', 'ego', 'frenetic', 'energy', 'balances.This', 'great', 'jazz', 'are', 'funny', 'scenes', 'instance', 'start', 'where', 'Sandy', 'train', 'hopelessness', 'passengers', 'sad', 'morose', 'heading', 'nowhere', 'parallel', 'track', 'are', 'people', 'laughing', 'glamorous', 'happy.Sandy', 'want', 'join', 'adjoining', 'train', 'get', 'back', 'track', 'where', 'go.He', 'later', 'plagued', 'hallucinations', 'aliens', 'who', 'question', 'why', 'changed', 'earlier', 'funny', ""films'.Allen"", 'great', 'gift', 'solemn', 'features', 'holding', 'back', 'desire', 'giggle', 'mock', 'vanity', 'world', 'seam', 'hilarity', 'big', 'dipper.In', 'answer', 'why', 'films', 'are', 'not', 'more', 'political', 'Bates', 'keep', 'open', 'flexible', 'subject', 'matter.One', 'two', 'scenes', 'show', 'younger', 'Sandy', 'learning', 'do', 'magic', 'tricks', 'stage.We', 'also', 'get', 'putting', 'oven', 'fire', 'using', 'fire', 'extinguisher', 'using', 'fire', 'extinguisher', 'get', 'pigeon', 'house.He', 'good', 'joke', 'intellectuals', 'being', 'mafia', 'get', 'rid', 'own', 'make', 'more', 'serious', 'films.Following', 'early', 'funny', 'films', 'became', 'more', 'ambitious', 'intellectual', 'Annie', 'Hall', '1977', 'Stardust', 'Memories', '1980', 'being', 'anguished', 'as', 'well', 'amusing', 'portraits.The', 'most', 'noted', 'division', 'Allen', '34', 'early', 'funny', 'ones', '34', 'more', 'serious', 'later', 'works', 'here', 'treated', 'running', 'joke', 'split', 'later', 'films', 'comedies', 'straight', 'dramas', 'mixture', 'two', 'Crimes', 'Misdemeanours', 'clear', 'dividing', 'line', 'two.As', 'variation', 'Fellini', '8', 'where', 'director', 'star', 'treading', 'line', 'self', 'indulgence', 'self', 'expression', 'most', 'autobiographical', 'where', 'director', 'creative', 'crisis', 'ransacks', 'past', 'inspiration', 'Allen', 'Stardust', 'Memories', 'disorder', 'neurosis', 'gift', 'making', 'one', 'better', 'films.With', 'retreat', 'Allen', 'playing', 'love', 'interest', 'films', 'one-liner', 'jokes', 'disappear', 'be', 'replaced', 'deepening', 'character', 'plot', 'drama']",N/A

Personally I think it was originally panned because it was sort of proactively mocking its critics, due to the seemingly autobiographical slant of it. Woody Allen always insists his films are not autobiographical, though he does write what he knows. Here's a somewhat slow, very European movie from an American master of comedy, about a director known for his comedies, who's being panned because his latest movies are dark and European and not funny...It's really brilliant, and just beautiful to watch being in Black and White. And- it is funny.
