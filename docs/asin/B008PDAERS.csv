Pokoyo is a pre-school animation series that provides award winning learning episodes that are also SUPER entertaining and fun. Pocoyo (Spanish for ""Little Me"") is a three year old boy who-in this movie- enjoys planting seeds, having picnics and solving puzzles- A's favorite episode was definitely Twinkle Twinkle. The episodes are short enough to keep her attention, and she loves to answer all the questions and interact with her friends! All the adventures are engaging and the animation is beautiful. We truly love Pokoyo!",5,Beautifully Animated Fun for Toddlers!,1367280000,"04 30, 2013",2013,600,"['month-', 'movie', 'night', 'movie', 'watched', 'Pokoyo', 'World', 'Pokoyo', 'pre-school', 'animation', 'series', 'award', 'winning', 'learning', 'episodes', 'are', 'also', 'SUPER', 'entertaining', 'fun', 'Pocoyo', 'Spanish', 'Little', 'Me', 'three', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'who-in', 'movie-', 'planting', 'seeds', 'having', 'picnics', 'solving', 'puzzles-', 'A', 'favorite', 'episode', 'was', 'definitely', 'Twinkle', 'Twinkle', 'episodes', 'are', 'short', 'enough', 'keep', 'attention', 'answer', 'questions', 'interact', 'friends', 'adventures', 'are', 'engaging', 'animation', 'beautiful', 'truly', 'love', 'Pokoyo']",N/A

I thought it was cute when we found it on a free App. Found the DVD very disappointing in the general concept of the show. The VOICE of whomever that is---SO annoying!!! What couldn't it be more appropriate to the character? I tried two different ones, so I guess I not a fan, nor do I want to waste my grand-daughters precious development time with such pointless nonsense.",1,Disappointed!,1396828800,"04 7, 2014",2014,433,"['irritated', 'Maybe', 'was', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'enough', 'Pocoyo', 'thought', 'was', 'cute', 'when', 'found', 'free', 'App', 'Found', 'DVD', 'very', 'disappointing', 'general', 'concept', 'show', 'VOICE', 'whomever', '-SO', 'annoying', 'What', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'appropriate', 'character', 'tried', 'two', 'different', 'ones', 'guess', 'not', 'fan', 'do', 'want', 'waste', 'grand-daughters', 'precious', 'development', 'time', 'such', 'pointless', 'nonsense']",N/A
1573398,A1IY1UDG9BNQXF,B008PDAERS,NB83,"[4, 4]","In this latest installment in the Pocoyo series, kids join Pocoyo and his friends as they spend time together learning about the world around them and discovering what it means to be a good friend. The DVD includes 12 episodes. ""The Seed"" gives a basic introduction to the science of how plants grow. ""Let's Go Camping"" teaches the importance of compromising and emphasizes that friends are more valuable than material things. ""Pato's Egg"" has Pato watching over an egg that hatches unexpectedly into a spider. Initially everyone is afraid of the spider, but they end up becoming friends. ""A Little Cloud"" is about Pocoyo befriending a crying cloud. ""Twinkle, Twinkle"" has a star fall from the sky that keeps everyone awake, but Pocoyo returns him to his home and all is well again. ""A Dog's Life"" plays out like a game of charades between the narrator and Pocoyo as he imitates different animals. ""Shutterbug"" shows Pato as a photographer who takes numerous photos of only flowers. His friends become uninterested and convince him to try a different subject matter. He attempts to take a group photo, but it keeps getting messed up. Pato is discouraged and frustrated until his friends show him that his photos don't have to be perfect to be wonderful! ""Table for Fun"" revolves around a hungry Pato who continues to be served pretend play food until he is surprised with a real cake. ""Duck Stuck"" shows an entertaining game of hide and seek between Pocoyo and Pato. ""Picnic Puzzle"" has Pocoyo, Pato and Ellie trying to enjoy their picnic when ants make off with some of their food. ""All for One"" has all of Pocoyo's friends finding ways to be airborne, but Pocoyo is left on the ground alone until Octopus gives him a lift. ""A Little Something Between Friends"" puts an emphasis on teamwork as Pato and Pocoyo build a castle of blocks together, but when Pocoyo causes it to fall they get into an argument and decide to not play together anymore. After some time passes, they realize that they miss each other and put their differences behind them. My boys who are 18 months and 5 years really enjoyed this DVD. I even found myself chuckling at Pocoyo and his friends' antics. This is a very cute show that fosters learning and curiosity. If your kids enjoy the Pocoyo series, then you shouldn't hesitate to add this to your collection.

1573399,A252UYCIYO62HN,B008PDAERS,Stephanie,"[0, 0]","We recently received a complimentary copy of the new  Pocoyo DVD  "" Pocoyo: Pocoyo's World"" from NCircle Entertainment as a member of the NSider program. They usually offer us a few different choices when they email me our DVD options, I try to choose a character/characters that we are less familiar with if possible because we are a big fan of many of the NCircle brands, and always looking to add new favorites. Pocoyo was indeed a new character to us and we have for sure found a new favorite. My daughter (3) and I both fell in love with this little guy right away. If you're not familiar with Pocoyo , NCircle describes him as ""a curious toddler who's full of laughter and fun...and a touch of good natured mischief"", and I agree. Pocoyo's World is approximately 90 minutes long and includes 12 short episodes, each episode is the perfect length to keep the attention of little ones. There are many lessons and discoveries packed into this DVD, from how plants grow from seeds, to what hatches from eggs. This is the perfect animation, characters, and lessons for smaller children (preschool and under). They are colorful and fun, yet perfectly simple and not over stimulating. We will definitely be seeing a lot more of Pocoyo and friends around here.",5,Pocoyo and friends are adorable,1367712000,"05 5, 2013",2013,1258,"['recently', 'received', 'complimentary', 'copy', 'new', 'Pocoyo', 'DVD', 'Pocoyo', 'Pocoyo', 'World', 'NCircle', 'Entertainment', 'member', 'NSider', 'program', 'usually', 'offer', 'few', 'different', 'choices', 'when', 'email', 'DVD', 'options', 'try', 'choose', 'character/characters', 'are', 'less', 'familiar', 'possible', 'are', 'big', 'fan', 'many', 'NCircle', 'brands', 'always', 'looking', 'add', 'new', 'favorites', 'Pocoyo', 'was', 'indeed', 'new', 'character', 'have', 'sure', 'found', 'new', 'favorite', 'daughter', '3', 'fell', 'love', 'little', 'guy', 'right', 'away', ""'re"", 'not', 'familiar', 'Pocoyo', 'NCircle', 'curious', 'toddler', 'who', 'full', 'laughter', 'fun', 'touch', 'good', 'natured', 'mischief', 'agree', 'Pocoyo', 'World', 'approximately', '90', 'minutes', 'long', '12', 'short', 'episodes', 'episode', 'perfect', 'length', 'keep', 'attention', 'little', 'ones', 'are', 'many', 'lessons', 'discoveries', 'packed', 'DVD', 'how', 'plants', 'grow', 'seeds', 'what', 'hatches', 'eggs', 'perfect', 'animation', 'characters', 'lessons', 'smaller', 'children', 'preschool', 'are', 'colorful', 'fun', 'yet', 'perfectly', 'simple', 'not', 'stimulating', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'seeing', 'lot', 'more', 'Pocoyo', 'friends', 'here']",N/A
1573400,A30X9M0J5WOVAS,B008PDAERS,The IEMommy,"[1, 1]","My kids have always loved Pocoyo and requested to watch it over and over. It's not my favorite because it is so short at seven minutes per episode that it doesn't buy me much time! So I was thrilled to receive Pocoyo's World to review! Finally they could watch a show they love and I don't have to get up every seven minutes to put on a new one!I don't know what it is about this show that enraptures my kids. It's one of those magic shows I know I can put on and they will be instantly silent and watch. The bright colors, silly characters and funny voices just hold their attention like no other.The DVD is the perfect length at 90 minutes because I like my kids to rest about that long for quiet time every time. It's also perfect if we have just a little time and they can watch a few episodes and there are easy stopping points.NCircle is great at creating children's shows that really focus on things that interest children and captivate them. My kids loved Let's Go Camping because we camp a lot and it's fun for them to see their beloved Pocoyo doing the same thing. They also liked The Seed and we talked about how seeds work and things grow from them. So it's entertaining and educational!Pocoyo: Pocoyo's World is such a fun, unique DVD that  my kids are excited to have. I love shows that posses such a unique quality that even I don't mind sitting down and watching with them.",5,Unique and Educational,1367884800,"05 7, 2013",2013,1389,"['kids', 'have', 'always', 'loved', 'Pocoyo', 'requested', 'watch', 'not', 'favorite', 'so', 'short', 'seven', 'minutes', 'episode', ""n't"", 'buy', 'much', 'time', 'So', 'was', 'thrilled', 'receive', 'Pocoyo', 'World', 'review', 'Finally', 'could', 'watch', 'show', 'love', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'get', 'up', 'seven', 'minutes', 'put', 'new', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'show', 'kids', 'one', 'magic', 'shows', 'know', 'can', 'put', 'will', 'be', 'instantly', 'silent', 'watch', 'bright', 'colors', 'silly', 'characters', 'funny', 'voices', 'just', 'hold', 'attention', 'other.The', 'DVD', 'perfect', 'length', '90', 'minutes', 'like', 'kids', 'rest', 'long', 'quiet', 'time', 'time', 'also', 'perfect', 'have', 'just', 'little', 'time', 'can', 'watch', 'few', 'episodes', 'are', 'easy', 'stopping', 'points.NCircle', 'great', 'creating', 'children', 'shows', 'really', 'focus', 'things', 'interest', 'children', 'captivate', 'kids', 'loved', 'Let', 'Go', 'Camping', 'camp', 'lot', 'fun', 'see', 'beloved', 'Pocoyo', 'doing', 'same', 'thing', 'also', 'liked', 'Seed', 'talked', 'how', 'seeds', 'work', 'things', 'grow', 'entertaining', 'educational', 'Pocoyo', 'Pocoyo', 'World', 'such', 'fun', 'unique', 'DVD', 'kids', 'are', 'excited', 'have', 'love', 'shows', 'unique', 'quality', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'sitting', 'down', 'watching']",N/A
