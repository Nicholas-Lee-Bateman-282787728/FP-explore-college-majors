1110582,A2B2A1PIIKOLUJ,B000WMA75E,D. Dutton,"[24, 24]","This 4 disk set includes the Complete CBS TV Broadcasts of the Ravens Playoff run. The Denver, Oakland and Giants games are announced by Phil Simms and Greg Gumble. The Tennessee game has Dick Enberg and Dan Deirdorf at the mike.The picture quality is very good. There are no commercials, no pre-game (only coin tosses), no player intros, no halftime, nor post-game coverage. There are no Special Features or extras of any kind.It's the games, the whole games, and nothing but the games.When you hit the skip button on your DVD remote, it takes you to the beginning of the next quarter. The root menu simply gives you the choice of the quarters. There are 4 disks. Each disk contains one game.I can't go 5 stars because I'd like to have seen some features. It would have been nice to see Press Conference outtakes or some post game, and/or halftime analysis...something!It is great to watch these games again! I's great watch the historic Ravens Defense in it's prime.

The Ravens somewhat ""playing their future selves.""  Nice game.  The other two playoff games were terrific, and the Superbowl was won by the Ravens.

They also didn't include the dramatic introduction of the Ravens defense in the Super Bowl, or the presentation of the Lombardi Trophy.There are also no features.  It would've been cool to include a fifth disc with the 90 minute NFL Films highlight film.Essentially, if you're a Ravens fan, and you already have these games on tape like I do, save yourself the money and just burn them onto DVDs.  If not, it's a nice purchase.",3,Best Defense EVER!!!!!,1201564800,"01 29, 2008",2008,718,"['die', 'hard', 'Ravens', 'fan', 'was', 'fun', 'relive', 'games', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'XXXV', 'run.I', 'was', 'really', 'hoping', 'be', 'able', 'replace', 'video', 'tapes', 'original', 'games', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'did', ""n't"", 'include', 'presentation', 'LaMarr', 'Hunt', 'Trophy', 'AFC', 'Title', 'Game', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'include', 'dramatic', 'introduction', 'Ravens', 'defense', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'presentation', 'Lombardi', 'Trophy.There', 'are', 'also', 'features', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'cool', 'include', 'fifth', 'disc', '90', 'minute', 'NFL', 'Films', 'highlight', 'film.Essentially', ""'re"", 'Ravens', 'fan', 'already', 'have', 'games', 'tape', 'do', 'save', 'money', 'just', 'burn', 'DVDs', 'not', 'nice', 'purchase']",N/A

I decided to watch a game per day up until the big day since the set arrived just in time for this years championship run.  Besides the obvious differences in broadcast quality HD vs SD the sound is very crisp and amplifies well for the home game.  It was fascinating to watch the parallels between the 2000 team and the 2012 championship, one scored 34 points with mostly defense, and the other scored 34 with mostly offense.  Either way the fire of Ray Lewis pushed both of these teams to achieve their best. We need a 4 disc set just like this of the 2012/13 season no extras needed just the games.",5,Winnin' Ugly,1360022400,"02 5, 2013",2013,698,"['missed', 'second', 'half', 'amazing', 'run', 'back', '2000-2001', 'was', 'having', 'first', 'child', 'decided', 'watch', 'game', 'day', 'up', 'big', 'day', 'set', 'arrived', 'just', 'time', 'years', 'championship', 'run', 'obvious', 'differences', 'broadcast', 'quality', 'HD', 'vs', 'SD', 'sound', 'very', 'crisp', 'amplifies', 'well', 'home', 'game', 'was', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'parallels', '2000', 'team', '2012', 'championship', 'one', 'scored', '34', 'points', 'mostly', 'defense', 'other', 'scored', '34', 'mostly', 'offense', 'way', 'fire', 'Ray', 'Lewis', 'pushed', 'teams', 'achieve', 'best', 'need', '4', 'disc', 'set', 'just', '2012/13', 'season', 'extras', 'needed', 'just', 'games']",N/A
