As it says in one of the documentary extras in this set, the casting of Lynda Carter as Wonder Woman is perfection. In a series that could have been merely a campy spectacle, the fact that Lynda believes in her character and the power of women is very evident. The guest stars are impressive (Cloris Leachman, Kenneth Mars, Red Buttons, Stella Stevens) and the documentaries in each set are a nice addition. The commentary also adds interest, listening to Lynda and Producer Douglas Cramer (of ""Dynasty"" fame) reminisce about the series. Interesting tidbit: the fight between Stella Stevens and Lynda Carter was the inspiration for the catfight between Krystal and Alexis on ""Dynasty"" a few years later. In a day and age where computer graphics and sophisticated special effects abound, the simplicity of the production make it stand out in a positive way.

I gave this only four stars because the third season is more than a bit week storywise. The guest stars were featured too much and Wonder Women was too slow to catch the bad-guys.

As is usual in such cartoons, the laws of physics are broken on a frequent basis.  The military aspects are also unreal with senior officers performing tasks done by privates.  The television program was also aimed at the intellectual level of a ten year old with simplified plots and dialog.  So to enjoy the program you will have to turn off your disbelief and also not get insulted by the very low intellectual quality of the program.  In the interview Linda says that she was wearing special underwear to maker her larger on top.  She frequently comments on how hansom the men were and how wonderful her clothes were.It is claimed that this is the first TV program to have women with talent.

898355,A2RDF2SX15YZOD,B00083FZHC,"Krishna Jaipersad ""slyjai""","[5, 5]","I can tell you from the start that there a just a few superhero comics that translate very well to the small screen & the big screen. On the small one, Wonder Woman, The Flash,Superman & Batman(animated). On the big one, Batman & Superman, again. Seeing these episodes brought back fantastic memories. It will be said that in certain circles that the only one true Superman was Christopher Reeve, rest in peace. So, the same can be said about Wonder Woman, Linda Carter. If a movie is to be made in the near future, I hope that the actress who gets the title role, will do the excellent job that Miss Carter did all those years ago. I did not see an episode of Wonder Woman in many years, even when it was on the Sci Fi Channel. But, I do remember seeing some episodes as a child. They were fond memories of a beautiful woman fighting evil it all its forms & saving the world & mankind. Seeing these episodes again, reaffirms the view that I always believe in , a woman can get the job done just as well as man. The bottomline is the price is great especially, if you buy all 3 sets together. The quality could be a bit better, as there are some spots & print damage present, the sound is excellent even if it is 2.0 mono.The only problem is that the featurettes. They could have been longer & more behind the scenes stuff could have been included, where available. But there are few secrets that are divulged that explains quite a lot.

898356,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B00083FZHC,Mark Baker,"[26, 26]","I admit it.  Even as a kid, I always like Wonder Woman the best of all the super heroes.  And for the silliest reason.  I love her ability to change from Diana Prince to Wonder Woman by spinning.  I always thought that was so cool.  Naturally, this was one of the few shows I was going to buy if it ever came out on DVD.So my list of shows I'm allowed to buy has grown, but this show remains a great one to have on DVD.  And this set is your one stop shop for the entire series.Season one finds Wonder Woman (Lynda Carter) leaving Paradise Island to help America fight the Nazis in World War II.  The set includes all 13 of the WWII episodes, including the extended pilot.  I'll admit to never having been a super fan of this season.  To this day, it seems cheesy to me.  I think one problem is that they give Wonder Woman too many ""love will solve everything"" lines.Seasons two and three find our heroine on a new network and in a new decade.  Wonder Woman is called to the world of men once again to fight the evils of the ""modern"" 70's.  Teaming up with the son of the original Steve Trevor (still played by Lyle Waggoner), she joins the Inter Agency Defense Command and finds plenty of danger to keep her busy.  I much prefer the modern episodes because they allow Diana and Wonder Woman to develop a personality.  This changes happens slowly over season 2, and by season 3 she's a must stronger character.  I find her a fun character to watch.  And she takes on the bad guys head on, more concerned with catching them then transforming them.These DVD sets are great for fans.  They are two sided discs to keep the price down.  With three episodes per side, you get a sharp picture and clear sound.  Presented like they were on TV 30 years ago, there's nothing here that will blow you away, but there doesn't have to be.  Season 1 has a commentary on the pilot and then a ""how the series came to be"" documentary.  Season 2 has a documentary as well, and season 3 concludes with a commentary on the season premier and a documentary on Wonder Woman as a feminist icon.So the series is slightly (ok, greatly) dated and a whole lot cheesier then I remember.  It's still fun for the nostalgia crowd.  And Lynda Carter will always be Wonder Woman to me.  I'm thrilled to have these and know I will enjoy them for quite some time to come.
