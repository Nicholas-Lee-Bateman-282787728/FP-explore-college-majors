Not only is all the acting first-rate, but the dialogue proceeds at machine-gun rate, seemingly non-stop, and the result is beautiful, entertaining, and believable. Lake Bell's acting is phenomenal---she is the goofy daughter trying to excel at voice-over recordings for movies and commercials. Her movements and facial expressions, as well as the delivery of her lines, are all mesmerizing since they all look captivating and also very natural. The plot, the pace, the dialogue, the acting---all are outstanding. As the other reviewers say, let's hope she does more movies in the future.

1677475,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B00G7QQ1Y0,California Dreaming,"[1, 1]","I had never really thought about it before, but by just watching the trailer for this movie about trailers -- kind of ironic -- it made me realize that, yeah, how come women never do movie trailer voice overs?  Is it really that men are better suited for this profession than women, just like Geena Davis seems to imply here in a nice little cameo?  Or is it that people just haven't thought about women doing voice overs before, just like me, and so women don't get the chance?Well, no matter.  The star here -- Lake Bell -- who gives a very nice understated performance, shows that perhaps she can easily do voice overs.  She reminds me of a toned-down Sarah Silverman in a way, and this film reminds me of something that Ms. Silverman would do, with perhaps a little Woody Allenesque camerawork here and there.  (Note a scene where a husband and a wife are in an apartment, separated by a wall, where one camera is used in a mildy-lengthy shot.)I really liked this film a lot.  It's very funny, and I think that perhaps the best work went all the way back to the writing of the screenplay.  It may have been even earlier than that, where someone just had the idea.  He -- or she -- just sat around probably and thought, ""Wow.  How come women don't do trailer voice overs anyways?"" and the idea for the initial screenplay was probably born.  I also liked the cast, as most of the well-known stars really just do cameos, and the rest of the cast -- no slouches, mind you -- do excellent jobs themselves but never seem to get in each others' way.I'll go with a pretty big recommendation on a surprisingly thought-provoking film that makes fun of the film business itself.

1677480,A1GA996JHP23Y3,B00G7QQ1Y0,Douglas Maclean,"[1, 1]","In a world were one voice stands out as universally recognizable far too few people know the name that issued those rich, resonating tones, Don LaFontaine. He was the man that provided the voice overs used in movie trailers that preceded most of the movies that we watched for decades. By instilling the phrase &#8220;In a World&#8221; into the popular jargon he has alter the zeitgeist of the last few generations.  As it happens the phrase is also the title of one of the most imaginative independent films I have seen in a long time.  Understandably the underlying plot point of the film is concerned with the highly competitive world of voice over artists. Many actors want to move on, expanding their repertoire to include screenwriting and directing.  The ones with more ambition than talent and patience they push for some vanity project to exploit the name recognition they built up through their work in front of the camera. Fortunately for those of us that are fans of real cinema Lake Bell has carefully plotted her eclectic curriculum vitae by waiting, learning and understanding the intricacies of the full scope of cinematic artistic expression. Ms Bell has acted in comedies, dramas, and dabbled in thrillers even staring in a short lived but well produced science fiction television series. This film, aptly titled &#8216;In a World&#8217; is her freshman opus as screenwriter and director and thanks to the years of diligence it is exceptional quality from inception through execution. With a start as an independent filmmaker like this Ms Bell is certain to continue to be a festival favorite lauding her work in in any number of capacities.Carol Solomon (Lake Bell) has had an ambition to become the first well known female voice over artist. While she does possess a string and extremely versatile voice that career seemed doomed before it could take flight. The problem is not talent but a distinctive form of reverse nepotism. Carol grew in the formidable shadow of her father Sam Soto (Fred Melamed) the current most famous member of that small be fiercely competitive industry. Sam is widely hailed as the heir apparent to the late, great Don LaFontaine. Cementing that lauded position is the success of his autobiography and the fact that it has been announced that he is to receive a life time achievement award for his industry&#8217;s Guild. While working on getting her big break doing voice overs Carole earns a living and continues to hone her voice by working as a voice coach, besides a class and private lessons she does find work in the movies helping actresses master accents. In one instance that we get to witness Carol has to teach Eva Longoria to use a passable cockney accent in her upcoming movie.Carol had been living in her father&#8217;s house but is unceremoniously tossed out so Sam&#8217;s girlfriend, Jamie (Alexandra Holden) can move in. Adding to her consternation is the fact that Jamie is almost exactly the same age as Carol. With literally nowhere else to go Carol moves in with her sister Dani (Michaela Watkins) who eschewed the vocal family business to work as a concierge. Carol uses her sister&#8217;s hotel connections to record the voices of clients in order to expand her library of accents and speech patterns.  Dani is sympathetic to Carol&#8217;s dilemma have grown up under Sam&#8217;s exceptional narcissism. From Sam&#8217;s perspective Don LaFontaine was just a warm-up preparing the world for the greatest that is him.  When a major studio announces that they were going to turn an extremely popular series of books into s film quadology; &#8216;The Amazon Games&#8217; every voice over artist in the industry is ready to kill for the job. This is pushed to unheard heights when as part of marketing to promote the franchise the plan to bring back Lafontaine&#8217;s trade mark phrase, &#8216;In a World&#8217;. Of course Sam is in consideration but he removes himself from consideration in order push the career of his friend and hopeful successor, Gustav Warner (Ken Marino). He is already sufficiently established in the field to afford a nicely appointed mansion. Always ready to show off his success and rub it in the faces of others Gustav throws a party to push his certainty that with Sam&#8217;s endorsement he will be the one to resurrect the most famous line in the history of trailers.Circumstances seem to conspire against Carol. Because of her constant tapping the voices of guests the hotel where Dani works bans Carol. Anxious to add a certain dialect to her collection she Dani to record a set of questions recording the client&#8217;s responses.  When Dani&#8217;s husband, Moe (Rob Corddry) inadvertently hears it out of its proper context he become certain his wife was creating on him. Carol and Dani wind up at Gustav&#8217;s party where Carol is flirted with by the host. In her cups Carol spends the night and later on Gustav brags to Sam about the party crasher he had sex with not realizing who she was. When Carol takes the lead in the &#8216;Amazon Games&#8217; job Gustav is outraged that he &#8216;stole&#8217;  his jog although he never officially was offered it. Carol&#8217;s agent, Louis (Demetri Martin) is ecstatic but soon the offer is up for grabs with every voice over artist scrambling to record an audition file that will put them over the top.  More is on the line for Carol; this would make her the first woman to do the trailers for a major film franchise and place her name alongside Don LaFontaine as associated with those iconic words.This movie in, for a large part, and film industry inside joke but it is crafted with such imagination and executed with a degree of skill that is incredible, that will inexorably pull you into this thin slice of the movie industry and hold you. The reason for this is although the story line is centered almost exclusively on the voice over community the themes that Ms Bell has infused in it are universal. At the heart of the film is a tale of a family that somewhere along the road veered into dysfunction. While the father put everything into pursuing his dream he alienated his family. One daughter sought a life away from films in a position where she catered to the whims of her clients while holding on to a marriage with a nice guy. The other daughter so loved and admired her father that she wanted to follow in his footsteps. When she finally gets her big break instead of being proud of his daughter&#8217;s accomplishments he names a self-serving, clone of himself to be his heir apparent. Beyond that Sam is ready to throw his daughter and friend under the bus for a shot at one more accolade. The humor is on the darker side built upon the tragedy of a father and daughter torn apart by ambition.Ms Lake not only stared in the film, wrote the screenplay and directed she also wore the producer&#8217;s hat. I would be at all surprise if she got to the set extra early to set up the craft service table. Apparently the principle photography for this movie was under three weeks with what had to be a miniscule budget, not only is Ms Bell a versatile actress and in her ascendency as a filmmaker but she has already garnered a crucial part of the art form; the ability to stay in budget and on schedule. Some filmmakers go on for decades without master the pragmatic aspect of making a movie. You can tell she has earned a lot of good will in the industry by noticing the guest stars. Besides comedians that have made a name for themselves in that venue like Rob Corddry , Demetri Martin and Ken Marino but some A list names are liberally sprinkled throughout the movie with Eva Longoria playing herself, Geena Davis as the studio executive and, if you look closely at the Amazon Games trailer, Cameron Diaz has a cameo as their leader. One little inside reference I admittedly needed IMDB to realize; one on the voice over artist was Joe Cipriano as himself. He was the announcer for the 2006 NBC science fiction series, &#8216;Surface&#8217; which stared Lake Bell. This is a witty Indy with strong character development, a solid narrative and directorial style. Most of all it has an abundance of heart.",5,In a wolrd were so many movies fall flat one rises above the pack,1390867200,"01 28, 2014",2014,8173,"['world', 'were', 'one', 'voice', 'out',

1677481,A1E6JS6C205VZD,B00G7QQ1Y0,Dr. Laurence Raw,"[1, 1]","IN A WORLD is set in the hitherto unexplored world of voice-over artistes; those people who are always heard announcing film trailers whose identities are seldom revealed.  Carol (Lake Bell) is struggling to make a living in the shadow of her father Sam's - stage name Sotto's (Fred Melamed's) reputation.  Hitherto the voiceover market has been dominated by male artistes, with Gustav (Ken Marino) seeking to challenge Sotto's position.  By accident Carol manages to obtain a high-profile gig at Gustav's expense, and from then on she is set on the road to voiceover stardom.  Needless to say her male rivals are outraged by this subversion of what they perceive as the 'natural' - i.e. patriarchal - order of things, and try to unseat her, even though Sotto is initially unaware of the female rival's identity.  IN A WORLD makes some neat satirical points about the inflated egos of voiceover artistes, who in their way are equally as prima-donna-like as any other performers, even though they spend their time having to teach better-known actors how to speak properly.  There's a neat scene in the film where Carol is shown trying to teach Eva Longoria how to speak cockney, a difficult task at the best of times.  Nor does director Bell - who also wrote the screenplay - give us the pleasure of a wish-fulfilling ending: Carol is shown returning to her first love of teaching young women how to pronounce better, so that they may advance their careers.  Voiceover artistes do not necessarily have to restrict their professional focus to the movie world.,  The script is both sharp and witty, with good supporting performances from Demetri Martin as a sound engineer trying to declare his love for Carol, and Rob Corddry as a long-suffering husband.",4,Charming Comedy About Voiceover Artists,1397001600,"04 9, 2014",2014,1752,"['IN', 'A', 'WORLD', 'set', 'hitherto', 'unexplored', 'world', 'voice-over', 'artistes', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'always', 'heard', 'announcing', 'film', 'trailers', 'identities', 'are', 'seldom', 'revealed', 'Carol', 'Lake', 'Bell', 'struggling', 'make', 'living', 'shadow', 'father', 'Sam', 'stage', 'name', 'Sotto', 'Fred', 'Melamed', 'reputation', 'Hitherto', 'voiceover', 'market', 'been', 'dominated', 'male', 'artistes', 'Gustav', 'Ken', 'Marino', 'seeking', 'challenge', 'Sotto', 'position', 'accident', 'Carol', 'obtain', 'high-profile', 'gig', 'Gustav', 'expense', 'then', 'set', 'road', 'voiceover', 'stardom', 'Needless', 'say', 'male', 'rivals', 'are', 'outraged', 'subversion', 'what', 'perceive', ""'natural"", 'i.e', 'patriarchal', 'order', 'things', 'try', 'unseat', 'even', 'Sotto', 'initially', 'unaware', 'female', 'rival', 'identity', 'IN', 'A', 'WORLD', 'neat', 'satirical', 'points', 'inflated', 'egos', 'voiceover', 'artistes', 'who', 'way', 'are', 'equally', 'as', 'prima-donna-like', 'other', 'performers', 'even', 'spend', 'time', 'having', 'teach', 'better-known', 'actors', 'how', 'speak', 'properly', 'neat', 'scene', 'film', 'where', 'Carol', 'shown', 'trying', 'teach', 'Eva', 'Longoria', 'how', 'speak', 'cockney', 'difficult', 'task', 'best', 'times', 'director', 'Bell', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'give', 'pleasure', 'wish-fulfilling', 'ending', 'Carol', 'shown', 'returning', 'first', 'love', 'teaching', 'young', 'women', 'how', 'pronounce', 'better', 'may', 'advance', 'careers', 'Voiceover', 'do', 'not', 'necessarily', 'have', 'restrict', 'professional', 'focus', 'movie', 'world.', 'script', 'sharp', 'witty', 'good', 'supporting', 'performances', 'Demetri', 'Martin', 'sound', 'engineer', 'trying', 'declare', 'love', 'Carol', 'Rob', 'Corddry', 'long-suffering', 'husband']",In a World

1677486,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00G7QQ1Y0,FNDNreview,"[1, 2]","The odds are pretty sizable that you won&#8217;t recognize the name Lake Bell.  By today&#8217;s standards, you could easily make the case that this particular actress has yet to leave her outstanding mark on the entertainment industry.  Over the years, she&#8217;s previously been a series regular on television shows, including Boston Legal and How to Make It in America.  Her roles in film are all over the board, appearing in supporting roles for popular films like No Strings Attached, A Good Old Fashioned Orgy, and Black Rock.  And, while her roles in both film and television have been far from noteworthy, the outstanding work she does in the film, In a World&#8230; might just be the primer she needs to hit the big time.Lake Bell takes on the heavy task of writing, directing, and starring in the film &#8211; portraying struggling voice coach, Carol Solomon.  Upon first meeting Carol, it&#8217;s clear she&#8217;s passionate about the voice-over industry, especially since she&#8217;s the daughter of one of the most prominent figures in the business, Sam Soto (Fred Melamed).  But, being a woman in a business that&#8217;s dominated by men has put her career in a massive funk and limited her to random voice coaching jobs.There&#8217;s also quite a bit going on in Carol&#8217;s personal life.  Her father abruptly kicks her out of the house so his incredibly young 30 year old girlfriend can move in, forcing Carol to stay with her sister, Dani (Michaela Watkins), and Dani&#8217;s husband, Moe (Rob Corddry).  Coinciding with her new living situation, Carol&#8217;s co-worker (and secret love interest), Louis (Demetri Martin), informs her that there&#8217;s serious interest in using her in commercials and various other projects.  However, the problem with that is it takes voice-over work away from the industry&#8217;s biggest up-and-coming star, Gustav Warner (Ken Marino) &#8211; whom Carol also becomes entangled with.Due to the passing of the voice-over legend, Don LaFontaine (most notable for coining the movie trailer voice-over phrase &#8220;in a world&#8230;&#8221;), there is now a free-for-all in the industry.  Carol&#8217;s father appears to be a shoe-in to replace LaFontaine as the industry leader, but he decides to put his support behind Gustav.  At the same time, Carol starts receiving more and more voice-over jobs, creating the possibility for her to steal the role of a lifetime when news hits that an upcoming film, The Amazon Games, will be searching for a new voice to bring back the famous &#8220;in a world&#8221; line.  Suddenly, the race is on to land the most sought after role in the voice-over industry.The fact that there is a whole film devoted to the voice-over industry doesn&#8217;t necessarily look that exciting on paper.  But, as usual &#8211; looks can be deceiving.  In fact, In a World&#8230; is a complete breath of fresh air, mostly because the majority of films these days feel repetitive and stuck in the mud.  Lake Bell, who recognized that the actual voice-over industry lacked a female presence, has decided to create a surprisingly entertaining story to give that particular industry some attention.  And, on top of that, she also manages to throw in some absurdity and screwball humor to go along with it.As the lead actress of this film, Lake Bell is very enjoyable and brings a massive amount of female dominance to the table (both in a production role and character portrayal).  Her character that&#8217;s funny with the way she goes through the motions of life, yet still remains to be some what driven &#8211; looking for her big break.  To Bell&#8217;s credit, some leading roles suffer when the same person is responsible for the script and the directing, however, Bell never misses a beat.  This role, her finest role to date, is impressive, not just from a comedic standpoint, but also from a dramatic standpoint.  If this is what Lake Bell is capable of accomplishing, then her future is unbelievably brightBell&#8217;s co-stars are also rather charming, starting with comedian Rob Coddry &#8211; who has recently starred in films that include Hot Tub Time Machine, Pain & Gain, and The Way Way Back.  He&#8217;s also responsible for creating the popular web series, Children&#8217;s Hospital, which he stars in, alongside both Lake Bell and Ken Marino.  Bell and Coddry share several scenes together, as do Bell and Marino, but sadly the trio never share a full scene together.  In any event, Coddry&#8217;s role is mostly of little importance to the underlying direction of Bell&#8217;s character, Coddry serves as mature voice of reason for both Carol and her sister who are continuously at odds with their overbearing father.Marino plays the self-absorbed &#8220;king-in-waiting&#8221; that has very little to gain and plenty to lose &#8211; which is evident when Bell&#8217;s character begins stealing his jobs.  Marino&#8217;s character is the closest thing to an antagonist in the film, coming off as slay and manipulative.  He oddly and abruptly becomes interested in Carol &#8211; although the humorous dynamic here is that he has no idea that she&#8217;s related to his mentor&#8217;s daughter (they have different last names).  Still, the majority of the film&#8217;s comedy comes from the interactions between Bell and Marino &#8211; especially during a party where they meet for the first time.Overall, In a World&#8230; is a small budget film that will not likely garner the attention of most moviegoers.  Never the less, Lake Bell has delivered an enjoyable flick that proves she can not only handle being the lead in a feature film, but she is also quite talented with a pen and being behind the camera.  This film will give you a generalized look at the voice-over industry, and leave an understandable impression of just how competitive the industry can be.  This particular feature knows when to be serious and when to throw in a few moments of laughter.  It&#8217;s romantic at times, graceful in others &#8211; combining for a surprisingly pleasant viewing experience.  If you&#8217;re into smaller budget films and are willing to give anything a shot, you won&#8217;t be disappointed by this invigorating comedy.GRADE:  BFNDNreview.com",4,"Lake Bell impresses as

One daughter is a hotel concierge the other is a voice coach and VO artist like her father.Dad is an older obese guy with a fantastic voice leading that industry after the passing of Don LaFontaine who wrote the book on voicing movie trailers with his God's brother-like voice.

When an opportunity to bring back the most recognizable phrase in modern movie trailer history, the grand &#34;In a World...&#34; opening, Carol finds herself competing primarily against her increduously egotistical father (Fred Melamed) and his equally egotistical protege, and Carol's one-night lover Gustav (Ken Marino) all while navigating through the fracturing marriage of her sister (Michaela Watkins) and her husband (the wonderful Rob Corddry) and the romantic inclinations of her co-worker (Demitri Martin).The film lives and dies by its quirky charms, which exist more often than not, and illustrating the difficulty of a young woman trying to break into a male-dominated profession is something that is an important story. Although, the biggest problem I had was the film, at times, felt too fractured under the weight of all the different stories it's trying to tell. It's something of a family drama, a romantic comedy, an inspirational against-all-odds tale, and a quirk-filled indie delight all at the same time, and it makes the whole experience a little uneven, especially in its 93-minute run time. However, the film never gets too bogged down or tries to be a &#34;message&#34; film. Bell does a very good job of keeping it light and breezy and fun, if not always hilariously funny. While Bell is the star, the performance that most impressed me was that of Corddry, who got to play with his vulnerable side rather than the consistently obnoxious characters he's been featured in films like HAROLD AND KUMAR GO TO GUANTANAMO BAY and HOT TUB TIME MACHINE.IN A WORLD isn't a film on the same level as recent indie breakthroughs like DON JON, THE SPECTACULAR NOW or SHORT TERM 12, but it's a very good start for someone with Bell's obvious talents both in front of and behind the camera.",4,"A solid directorial debut, but it left me wanting more.",1402272000,"06 9, 2014",2014,2226,"['Lake', 'Bell', 'pretty', 'exciting', 'new', 'face', 'actor/writer/director', 'triple-threat', 'department', 'IN', 'A', 'WORLD', 'clearly', 'fine', 'example', 'bringing', 'lot', 'talent', 'bear', 'very', 'solid', 'first', 'film.Set', 'incredibly', 'cutthroat', 'world', 'voice-over', 'performers', 'Carol', 'Bell', 'scraping', 'VO', 'trainer', 'other', 'more', 'recognizable', 'people', 'trying', 'very', 'hard', 'compete', 'extremely', 'male-dominated', 'field', 'When', 'opportunity', 'bring', 'back', 'most', 'recognizable', 'phrase', 'modern', 'movie', 'trailer', 'history', 'grand', '34', 'World', '34', 'opening', 'Carol', 'competing', 'primarily', 'increduously', 'egotistical', 'father', 'Fred', 'Melamed', 'equally', 'egotistical', 'protege', 'Carol', 'one-night', 'lover', 'Gustav', 'Ken', 'Marino', 'navigating', 'fracturing', 'marriage', 'sister', 'Michaela', 'Watkins', 'husband', 'wonderful', 'Rob', 'Corddry', 'romantic', 'inclinations', 'co-worker', 'Demitri', 'Martin', '.The', 'film', 'lives', 'dies', 'quirky', 'charms', 'exist', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'illustrating', 'difficulty', 'young', 'woman', 'trying', 'break', 'male-dominated', 'profession', 'something', 'important', 'story', 'biggest', 'problem', 'had', 'was', 'film', 'times', 'felt', 'too', 'fractured', 'weight', 'different', 'stories', 'trying', 'tell', 'something', 'family', 'drama', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'inspirational', 'against-all-odds', 'tale', 'quirk-filled', 'indie', 'delight', 'same', 'time', 'whole', 'experience', 'little', 'uneven', 'especially', '93-minute', 'run', 'time', 'However', 'film', 'never', 'too', 'bogged', 'down', 'tries', 'be', '34', 'message', '34', 'film', 'Bell', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'keeping', 'light', 'breezy', 'fun', 'not', 'always', 'hilariously', 'funny', 'Bell', 'star', 'performance', 'most', 'impressed', 'was', 'Corddry', 'who', 'got', 'play', 'vulnerable', 'side', 'rather', 'consistently', 'obnoxious', 'characters', 'been', 'featured', 'films', 'HAROLD', 'AND', 'KUMAR', 'GO', 'TO', 'GUANTANAMO', 'BAY', 'HOT', 'TUB', 'TIME', 'MACHINE.IN', 'A', 'WORLD', ""n't"", 'film', 'same', 'level', 'recent', 'indie', 'breakthroughs', 'DON', 'JON', 'THE', 'SPECTACULAR', 'NOW', 'SHORT', 'TERM', '12', 'very', 'good', 'start', 'someone', 'Bell', 'obvious', 'talents', 'front', 'camera']",In a World

Oleson,"[1, 1]","Lake Bell, perhaps best known as a television soap opera actress and second banana in sexy film romcoms, takes her first shot as a film director and hits the bulls eye.  She also wrote the screenplay and plays Carol in the film.Carol is a voice coach who is currently tutoring Eva Longoria (other stars have cameos throughout the film).  After the death of the long time star of movie trailer voice-overs (Don LaFontaine), Carol's dad Sam (Fred Melamed) has risen to the top.  Carol still lives at home as her career doesn't provide steady income.  Sam has struck a romantic relationship with Jamie (Alexandra Holden), a 30 year old woman about the same age as Carol.  Sam wants Carol to move out, so she checks in with her sister Dani (Michaela Watkins) and her husband Moe (Rob Corddry).Looking for a change, Carol decides to audition for a 4 movie series of trailers about Amazon women gleaned from graphic novels.  To everyone's surprise, she gets the gig now entering the rarefied air that her father breathed along with rising star Gustav (Ken Marino).  Initially unaware that Carol got the job, Sam has moved on and Carol has a one night stand with Gustav.  Once they realize Carol got the job, the two misogynists decide to go for it as well.What makes this film a bit different is certainly the writing and Ms. Bell charisma.  The interplay between the characters is all very natural sounding.  The story isn't terribly complicated, although there is an interesting subplot with Moe and Dani that Carol helps resolve.  I smiled throughout this film and laughed out loud on occasion.  Highly recommended.The Sony Blu ray disc is in 1080p with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  It looks very good but does look a bit soft on occasion.  The colors are accurate and black levels good.  It just doesn't jump out the viewer.  Generally the transfer is well-defined and has good detail.  No complaints.  The audio is also very good coming with a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track.  With ""voice"" the primary heart of the story, when the characters speak, it comes across loud and strong.  When Sam uses those low bass tones from his voice, I swear I heard the subwoofer go into action.  Clear, consistent and effective.  Subtitle options include Spanish, French and English SDH.  Extras include an audio commentary by Ms. Bell, 9 deleted scenes, a gag reel, ""In A World"" promos and some previews.",4,(BLU RAY REVIEW) 4 1/2 stars for a very funny directing debut,1393286400,"02 25, 2014",2014,2383,"['Lake', 'Bell', 'perhaps', 'best', 'known', 'television', 'soap', 'opera', 'actress', 'second', 'banana', 'sexy', 'film', 'romcoms', 'first', 'shot', 'film', 'director', 'bulls', 'eye', 'also', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'plays', 'Carol', 'film.Carol', 'voice', 'coach', 'who', 'currently', 'tutoring', 'Eva', 'Longoria', 'other', 'stars', 'have', 'cameos', 'film', 'death', 'long', 'time', 'star', 'movie', 'trailer', 'voice-overs', 'Don', 'LaFontaine', 'Carol', 'dad', 'Sam', 'Fred', 'Melamed', 'risen', 'top', 'Carol', 'still', 'home', 'career', ""n't"", 'provide', 'steady', 'income', 'Sam', 'struck', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'Jamie', 'Alexandra', 'Holden', '30', 'year', 'old', 'woman', 'same', 'age', 'Carol', 'Sam', 'Carol', 'move', 'out', 'sister', 'Dani', 'Michaela', 'Watkins', 'husband', 'Moe', 'Rob', 'Corddry', '.Looking', 'change', 'Carol', 'audition', '4', 'movie', 'series', 'trailers', 'Amazon', 'women', 'gleaned', 'graphic', 'novels', 'everyone', 'surprise', 'gig', 'now', 'entering', 'rarefied', 'air', 'father', 'breathed', 'along', 'rising', 'star', 'Gustav', 'Ken', 'Marino', 'Initially', 'unaware', 'Carol', 'got', 'job', 'Sam', 'moved', 'Carol', 'one', 'night', 'stand', 'Gustav', 'realize', 'Carol', 'got', 'job', 'two', 'misogynists', 'decide', 'go', 'well.What', 'film', 'bit', 'different', 'certainly', 'writing', 'Ms.', 'Bell', 'charisma', 'interplay', 'characters', 'very', 'natural', 'sounding', 'story', ""n't"", 'terribly', 'complicated', 'interesting', 'subplot', 'Moe', 'Dani', 'Carol', 'resolve', 'smiled', 'film', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'occasion', 'Highly', 'recommended.The', 'Sony', 'Blu', 'ray', 'disc', '1080p', '2.40:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'very', 'good', 'look', 'bit', 'soft', 'occasion', 'colors', 'are', 'accurate', 'black', 'levels', 'good', 'just', ""n't"", 'jump', 'out', 'viewer', 'Generally', 'transfer', 'well-defined', 'good', 'detail', 'complaints', 'audio', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'coming', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '5.1', 'track', 'voice', 'primary', 'heart', 'story', 'when', 'characters', 'speak', 'loud', 'strong', 'When', 'Sam', 'low', 'bass', 'tones', 'voice', 'swear', 'heard', 'subwoofer', 'go', 'action', 'Clear', 'consistent', 'effective', 'Subtitle', 'options', 'include', 'Spanish', 'French', 'English', 'SDH', 'Extras', 'include', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Ms.', 'Bell', '9', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'gag', 'reel', 'World', 'promos', 'previews']",In a World

1677511,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00G7QQ1Y0,Paul Allaer,"[34, 38]","&#34;In a World...&#34; (2013 release; 93 min.) brings the story of Carol (played by Lake Bell), a struggling voice coach trying to break into the fiercely competitive and men-dominated voice over industry for doing movie trailers. As the opening credits roll, we see archive footage featuring Don LaFontaine, the legendary voice over artist for countless movie trailers who coined the phrase &#34;In a world&#34;. Carol is living with her dad Sam, himself a top talent in the voice over industry. But soon Carol is kicked out so that Sam's 30 yr. old girlfriend can move in (Sam tells Carol &#34;I'm supporting you by not supporting you&#34;, ha!). Carol moves in with her sister Dani (played by Michaela Watkins). Then by happenstance, Carol is able to land a movie trailer project, much to the dismay of others (&#34;she is the chick who snagged the gig!&#34; screams one). To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first and foremost, this is the &#34;Lake Bell show&#34; from start to finish. In addition to starring, she also wrote, directed and co-produced the movie. And shine she does indeed. oozing charm from start to finish. Even though she's been around quite a long time on TV and in movies, I really hadn't seen much of her, and this movie is for me Lake Bell's grand coming out party. Second, Bell surrounds herself with a lot of great talent, including the already mentioned Michaela Watkins but also Rob Corddry (as Dani's husband) and Geena Davis as the movie producer. Eva Longoria plays herself in a hilarious cameo at the beginning of the movie. Third, this movie is actually funny, as it actually made me laugh! It is rare for a movie to make people laugh out loud, reason why comedies are so hard to make and be successful. Last but not least: this movie is more than just a comedy, with a couple of serious undertones, including &#34;women empowerment&#34; (check out the hilarious &#34;Amazon Games&#34; parody of &#34;The Hunger Games&#34;), and the voice over industry itself (why indeed are there no movie trailers voiced by women)?&#34;In A World...&#34; made quite a splash at the Sundance film festival earlier this year (it won &#34;Best Screenplay&#34; for Lake Bell), and deservedly so. I saw the movie this past August at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati and I was frankly surprised how well attended the screening was when I saw it, as this has gotten little or no marketing push. But that is great news as it turns out that &#34;In A World...&#34; is one of those &#34;little movies that could&#34;. I enjoyed it from start to finish, and would readily recommend that you see this, be it in the theatre or (more likely by now) on DVD/Blu-ray.",4,"Lake Bell shines in this ""little movie that could""",1384300800,"11 13, 2013",2013,2794,"['34', 'World', '34', '2013', 'release', '93', 'min', 'story', 'Carol', 'played', 'Lake', 'Bell', 'struggling', 'voice', 'coach', 'trying', 'break', 'fiercely', 'competitive', 'men-dominated', 'voice', 'industry', 'doing', 'movie', 'trailers', 'opening', 'credits', 'roll', 'see', 'archive', 'footage', 'featuring', 'Don', 'LaFontaine', 'legendary', 'voice', 'artist', 'countless', 'movie', 'trailers', 'who', 'coined', 'phrase', '34', 'world', '34', 'Carol', 'living', 'dad', 'Sam', 'top', 'talent', 'voice', 'industry', 'soon', 'Carol', 'kicked', 'out', 'Sam', '30', 'yr.', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'can', 'move', 'Sam', 'Carol', '34', ""'m"", 'supporting', 'not', 'supporting', '34', 'ha', 'Carol', 'sister', 'Dani', 'played', 'Michaela', 'Watkins', 'Then', 'happenstance', 'Carol', 'able', 'land', 'movie', 'trailer', 'project', 'much', 'dismay', 'others', '34', 'chick', 'who', 'snagged', 'gig', '34', 'one', 'tell', 'more', 'plot', 'would', 'ruin', 'viewing', 'experience', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'see', 'how', 'out.Couple', 'comments', 'first', 'foremost', '34', 'Lake', 'Bell', 'show', '34', 'start', 'finish', 'addition', 'starring', 'also', 'wrote', 'directed', 'co-produced', 'movie', 'shine', 'indeed', 'oozing', 'charm', 'start', 'finish', 'Even', 'been', 'quite', 'long', 'time', 'TV', 'movies', 'really', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'much', 'movie', 'Lake', 'Bell', 'grand', 'coming', 'out', 'party', 'Second', 'Bell', 'lot', 'great', 'talent', 'including', 'already', 'mentioned', 'Michaela', 'Watkins', 'also', 'Rob', 'Corddry', 'Dani', 'husband', 'Geena', 'Davis', 'movie', 'producer', 'Eva', 'Longoria', 'hilarious', 'cameo', 'beginning', 'movie', 'Third', 'movie', 'actually', 'funny', 'actually', 'made', 'rare', 'movie', 'make', 'people', 'loud', 'reason', 'why', 'comedies', 'are', 'so', 'hard', 'make', 'be', 'successful', 'Last', 'not', 'least', 'movie', 'more', 'just', 'comedy', 'couple', 'serious', 'undertones', 'including', '34', 'women', 'empowerment', '34', 'check', 'out', 'hilarious', '34', 'Amazon', 'Games', '34', 'parody', '34', 'Hunger', 'Games', '34', 'voice', 'industry', 'why', 'indeed', 'are', 'there', 'movie', 'trailers', 'voiced', 'women', '34', 'A', 'World', '34', 'made', 'splash', 'Sundance', 'film', 'festival', 'earlier', 'year', 'won', '34', 'Best', 'Screenplay', '34', 'Lake', 'Bell', 'deservedly', 'so', 'saw', 'movie', 'past', 'August', 'local', 'art-house', 'theatre', 'here', 'Cincinnati', 'was', 'frankly', 'surprised', 'how', 'well', 'attended', 'screening', 'was', 'when', 'saw', 'gotten', 'little', 'marketing', 'push', 'great', 'news', 'out', '34', 'A', 'World', '34', 'one', '34', 'little', 'movies', 'could', '34', 'enjoyed', 'start', 'finish', 'would', 'readily', 'recommend', 'see', 'be', 'theatre', 'more', 'likely', 'now', 'DVD/Blu-ray']",In a World

1677520,A3D6KZT0QG6UKB,B00G7QQ1Y0,"Tim Lieder ""Founder of Dybbuk Press""","[2, 2]","This is a fun movie about a woman trying to get ahead in voiceover acting. Lake Bell is enough to recommend it since she has comic timing and an ear for dialogue. Her script is a generous depiction of both professional competitive voiceover actors and families and it pulls the rare trick of mocking without being mean about it (the sexy baby doll voice is a particular target). The script skews away from one-dimensional villains and broad stereotypes. Even Ken Marino's star voiceover actor who is introduced as the arrogant alpha male gets to show his insecurities and generosity, especially in his willingness to be good-natured about competition.Beyond the fact that it's an enjoyable comedy with likeable people, there's a lot to this movie that I wish that I didn't admire - only because none of this should be rare in Hollywood movies. It passes the Bechdel Test without even trying. The protagonist has a one-night stand and is not punished for it. It doesn't depict the supporting female characters as bimbos for the female protagonists to overcome. Infidelity is depicted in a realistic manner with regret and hurt feelings. There's a love story that doesn't involve anyone &#34;winning&#34; anyone else so much as two characters who really like each other deciding to take a shot.It shouldn't be so refreshing to see these things in a movie, but it is. In a better world, most movies would avoid the kinds of infantile morality and patriarchal domination that this movie avoids. However, even if these things were not rare, this would still be a great and fun movie.",5,I wish that there were more movies like this,1399593600,"05 9, 2014",2014,1578,"['fun', 'movie', 'woman', 'trying', 'get', 'ahead', 'voiceover', 'acting', 'Lake', 'Bell', 'enough', 'recommend', 'comic', 'timing', 'ear', 'dialogue', 'script', 'generous', 'depiction', 'professional', 'competitive', 'voiceover', 'actors', 'families', 'rare', 'trick', 'mocking', 'being', 'mean', 'sexy', 'baby', 'doll', 'voice', 'particular', 'target', 'script', 'away', 'one-dimensional', 'villains', 'broad', 'stereotypes', 'Even', 'Ken', 'Marino', 'star', 'voiceover', 'actor', 'who', 'introduced', 'arrogant', 'alpha', 'male', 'show', 'insecurities', 'generosity', 'especially', 'willingness', 'be', 'good-natured', 'competition.Beyond', 'fact', 'enjoyable', 'comedy', 'likeable', 'people', 'lot', 'movie', 'wish', 'did', ""n't"", 'admire', 'only', 'none', 'should', 'be', 'rare', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'Bechdel', 'Test', 'even', 'trying', 'protagonist', 'one-night', 'stand', 'not', 'punished', ""n't"", 'depict', 'supporting', 'female', 'characters', 'bimbos', 'female', 'protagonists', 'overcome', 'Infidelity', 'depicted', 'realistic', 'manner', 'regret', 'hurt', 'feelings', 'love', 'story', ""n't"", 'involve', 'anyone', '34', 'winning', '34', 'anyone', 'else', 'so', 'much', 'two', 'characters', 'who', 'really', 'other', 'deciding', 'take', 'shot.It', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'refreshing', 'see', 'things', 'movie', 'better', 'world', 'most', 'movies', 'would', 'avoid', 'kinds', 'infantile', 'morality', 'patriarchal', 'domination', 'movie', 'avoids', 'However', 'even', 'things', 'were', 'not', 'rare', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'great', 'fun', 'movie']",In a World

She is suddenly in the running for the coveted &#34;In a world...&#34; trailer comeback. The only problem is her famous father and his prot&eacute;g&eacute; (Marino) want the same thing.

1677523,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00G7QQ1Y0,Turfseer,"[2, 5]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***'In a World...' refers to the clich&eacute;d opening line in countless movie trailers performed by the master of voice-over artists, Don LaFontaine, who died in 2008. Whether LaFontaine himself would have liked 'In a World...' (the movie), a comedy about the voice-over movie trailer industry, is a matter of conjecture. Certainly it's an original concept but does it sustain itself over the entire 93 minute running time?'In a World...' derives most of its humor from a new trend in American comedy: the observation of the passive-aggressive type. Not unlike such independent films as 'Cyrus' or the mainstream hit, 'Bridesmaids', the passive-character constantly is unable to say 'no' and is so afraid of displeasing others, that they constantly cave into the demands of those who they actually dislike. Often these passive-aggressive types will express their true-feelings of disdain in front of the person they ultimately give in to.A prime example of this type of behavior is illustrated by the actions of the 'In a World...' protagonist, Carol Solomon (Lake Bell), who is an up and coming voice-over artist, who happens to be the daughter of the voice-over industry darling, Sam (played by the well-known, real-life voice-over artist, Fred Melamed). After Sam makes it clear she can't live with him anymore, Carol moves in with her sister, Dani, a hotel concierge.The main plot concerns Carol and Sam competing for a big voice-over job for the new 'Amazon Games' movie trailer (a slightly amusing take-off on the 'Hunger Games'). Carol is a classic passive-aggressive type who can't say no. Despite her disdain for Gustav, her sleazy voice-over rival, she ends up staying the night with him after attending Gustav's raucous party.There's a subplot involving Carol's passive-aggressive sister, Dani, who can't say no to Carol, when she wants him to tape a handsome Irish flirt at the hotel for her special 'voice archive'. When Dani's husband Moe, accidentally comes across the tape, he assumes Dani is actually making a play for the Irishman at the hotel and decides to leave her. You can probably guess that the now estranged couple, eventually reconcile.When Carol actually ends up winning the job for the 'Amazon Games', her father throws a hissy fit at the awards ceremony where he refuses to acknowledge that Carol actually earned the job fair and square. Only through the intervention of his sagacious younger girlfriend, Jamie, does Sam finally see the light and end up acknowledging both daughters for their talent, love and support. Carol seems to find love herself with the incredibly nerdy Louis, her recording engineer, and finally probably realizes better to end up with an equal (than an opposite, like Gustav).'In a World...' never really rises above the level of sit-com humor. The characters are modeled on these passive-aggressive types, who thrive on repeating the same kind of self-deprecating jokes, ad infinitum. There is some gentle ribbing of the movie trailer industry which occasionally is amusing, but ultimately there are few laughs here at all. Better to watch the movie trailers themselves than this light weight, formulaic put-down.",2,Few laughs as passive-aggressive types inhabit film trailer voice-over industry world,1391990400,"02 10, 2014",2014,3209,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', ""***'In"", 'World', 'refers', 'clich', 'eacute', 'opening', 'line', 'countless', 'movie', 'trailers', 'performed', 'master', 'voice-over', 'artists', 'Don', 'LaFontaine', 'who', 'died', '2008', 'LaFontaine', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'World', 'movie', 'comedy', 'voice-over', 'movie', 'trailer', 'industry', 'matter', 'conjecture', 'Certainly', 'original', 'concept', 'sustain', 'entire', '93', 'minute', 'running', 'time', 'World', 'most', 'humor', 'new', 'trend', 'American', 'comedy', 'observation', 'passive-aggressive', 'type', 'Not', 'such', 'independent', 'films', ""'Cyrus"", 'mainstream', 'hit', 'passive-character', 'constantly', 'unable', 'say', ""'no"", 'so', 'afraid', 'displeasing', 'others', 'constantly', 'cave', 'demands', 'who', 'actually', 'dislike', 'Often', 'passive-aggressive', 'types', 'will', 'express', 'true-feelings', 'disdain', 'front', 'person', 'ultimately', 'give', 'to.A', 'prime', 'example', 'type', 'behavior', 'illustrated', 'actions', ""'In"", 'World', 'protagonist', 'Carol', 'Solomon', 'Lake', 'Bell', 'who', 'up', 'coming', 'voice-over', 'artist', 'who', 'be', 'daughter', 'voice-over', 'industry', 'darling', 'Sam', 'played', 'well-known', 'real-life', 'voice-over', 'artist', 'Fred', 'Melamed', 'Sam', 'clear', 'ca', ""n't"", 'live', 'anymore', 'Carol', 'sister', 'Dani', 'hotel', 'concierge.The', 'main', 'plot', 'concerns', 'Carol', 'Sam', 'competing', 'big', 'voice-over', 'job', 'new', 'Games', 'movie', 'trailer', 'slightly', 'amusing', 'take-off', ""'Hunger"", 'Games', 'Carol', 'classic', 'passive-aggressive', 'type', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'no', 'disdain', 'Gustav', 'sleazy', 'voice-over', 'rival', 'up', 'staying', 'night', 'attending', 'Gustav', 'raucous', 'party.There', 'subplot', 'involving', 'Carol', 'passive-aggressive', 'sister', 'Dani', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'no', 'Carol', 'when', 'tape', 'handsome', 'Irish', 'flirt', 'hotel', 'special', ""'voice"", 'archive', 'When', 'Dani', 'husband', 'Moe', 'accidentally', 'tape', 'Dani', 'actually', 'making', 'play', 'Irishman', 'hotel', 'decides', 'leave', 'can', 'probably', 'guess', 'now', 'estranged', 'couple', 'eventually', 'reconcile.When', 'Carol', 'actually', 'up', 'winning', 'job', ""'Amazon"", 'Games', 'father', 'hissy', 'fit', 'awards', 'ceremony', 'where', 'acknowledge', 'Carol', 'actually', 'earned', 'job', 'fair', 'square', 'Only', 'intervention', 'sagacious', 'younger', 'girlfriend', 'Jamie', 'Sam', 'finally', 'see', 'light', 'end', 'up', 'acknowledging', 'daughters', 'talent', 'love', 'support', 'Carol', 'find', 'love', 'incredibly', 'nerdy', 'Louis', 'recording', 'engineer', 'finally', 'probably', 'better', 'end', 'up', 'equal', 'opposite', 'Gustav', 'World', 'never', 'really', 'level', 'sit-com', 'humor', 'characters', 'are', 'modeled', 'passive-aggressive', 'types', 'who', 'thrive', 'repeating', 'same', 'kind', 'self-deprecating', 'jokes', 'ad', 'infinitum', 'gentle', 'ribbing', 'movie', 'trailer', 'industry', 'occasionally', 'amusing', 'ultimately', 'are', 'few', 'laughs', 'here', 'Better', 'watch', 'movie', 'light', 'weight', 'formulaic', 'put-down']",In a World

That handful of vocal specialists form a little culture all their own, with their leaders, their myths and legends - and no women, a true boys' club. Carol (played by Lake Bell) was raised on the edge of that world, a coach and voice actress in her own right, but also daughter of one of the greats of the movie trailer voice-over clique. That sets in motion the two big conflicts. First, there's the war of the sexes, with men not yet ready to cede professional territory to the female interloper. Second, there's the inter-generational conflict, with the paterfamilias not yet ready to cede anything to the generation he sired. It becomes especially brutal when the man/woman and generational tensions appear between the same players.But, for all that, it's still a comedy.
