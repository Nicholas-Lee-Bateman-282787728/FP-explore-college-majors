Her pacing, voice inflection, body language, and joke &amp; story-telling are perfect throughout this DVD.  Using these skills, Wanda connects with the audience in a personal way that elevates her far above the drivel of your every day comic.Wanda's political observations are poignant and avoid becoming &quot;cheap shots&quot; by applying universal truths to what she sees.  For example, President Bush's &quot;sinister laugh&quot; gets compared to that of a villain in a classic cartoon.  And, as Wanda opines, is Condoleezza Rice, our National Security Advisor, sharing more than recipes and neighborhood talk at the beauty parlor? These are only a few of the many, many gems in this DVD.  It's not overly-political.  She makes plenty of common observations that will propel you into fits of laughterDecent DVD extras include:  an additional comedy show by Wanda Sykes; deleted scenes; and various Comedy Central skits.Buy this now!

758805,AOVOJZZJP7BOC,B00009W8NH,Oneironaut,"[0, 0]","I know some people think her voice is annoying, but I think it just makes her comedy even more funny to listen to.  You can tell she's sincere and that this is how she really sees life, and it's usually true.  From the government to strippers, she just gets right to the ludicrously hilarious truth.  You do wonder if the Pope ever just puts on a bathrobe and a Burger King crown sometimes, you do wonder how Christine Whitman ever got elected as head of the EPA, and you do wonder why people think having a drunk follow you home improves their own drunk driving.  But her delivery is at least half of what's funny about it.  She reminds me of those friends you had at school or some horrible job who made it all bearable by cracking you up.  It's not that she's trying to be funny necessarily, you can just tell this is how she always talks and tells stories.I actually don't have cable but a friend of mine had the DVD playing at his place and I just about fell over laughing, I went right out and got my own copy.  I know she does TV shows and movies, but I rarely enjoy standups as actors.  So I can't speak for her as an actor, maybe her shows aren't so great.  This show, however, still makes me laugh even after seeing it multiple times.Also, don't forget that there is a bonus show from when she was Wanda Skyes-Hall, which is just as funny.If you like tell-it-like-it-is standup comedy without shtick and mugging, Wanda is one of the best.",5,Damn hilarious!,1185580800,"07 28, 2007",2007,1448,"['know', 'people', 'think', 'voice', 'annoying', 'think', 'just', 'comedy', 'even', 'more', 'funny', 'listen', 'can', 'tell', 'sincere', 'how', 'really', 'life', 'usually', 'true', 'government', 'strippers', 'just', 'right', 'ludicrously', 'hilarious', 'truth', 'do', 'wonder', 'Pope', 'ever', 'just', 'bathrobe', 'Burger', 'King', 'crown', 'sometimes', 'do', 'wonder', 'how', 'Christine', 'Whitman', 'ever', 'got', 'elected', 'head', 'EPA', 'do', 'wonder', 'why', 'people', 'think', 'having', 'drunk', 'follow', 'home', 'improves', 'own', 'drunk', 'driving', 'delivery', 'least', 'half', 'what', 'funny', 'friends', 'had', 'school', 'horrible', 'job', 'who', 'made', 'bearable', 'cracking', 'up', 'not', 'trying', 'be', 'funny', 'necessarily', 'can', 'just', 'tell', 'how', 'always', 'talks', 'tells', 'stories.I', 'actually', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'cable', 'friend', 'mine', 'had', 'DVD', 'playing', 'place', 'just', 'about', 'fell', 'laughing', 'went', 'right', 'out', 'got', 'own', 'copy', 'know', 'TV', 'shows', 'movies', 'rarely', 'enjoy', 'standups', 'actors', 'So', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'actor', 'maybe', 'shows', 'are', ""n't"", 'so', 'great', 'show', 'however', 'still', 'even', 'seeing', 'multiple', 'times.Also', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'bonus', 'show', 'when', 'was', 'Wanda', 'Skyes-Hall', 'just', 'funny.If', 'tell-it-like-it-is', 'standup', 'comedy', 'shtick', 'mugging', 'Wanda', 'one', 'best']",Wanda Sykes - Tongue Untied

Every once in awhile a new comedian will come along and make me rearrange my top 10 list but Wanda Sykes consistently stays in the top five (if not the top three). This DVD proves why. She goes from joking about why she feels like she shouldn't have to pay to go to a strip club (B.Y.O.T.--classic!) to why George W. Bush wasn't ""smart"" until after Sept. 11. Although some of her jokes were more factual than comedy (women REALLY do think entirely too much and harp on small things), what I like about her is that she's as successful with a political joke as she is with a goofy joke like why New York is better because you can drink and not worry about driving. On top of that, she does some physical comedy. I'm a big fan of comedians who aren't afraid to make themselves look crazy (in their same outfit, no dumb accessories or completely new outfit) to get the joke across. Not too many people can make me laugh at the hump in the Pope's back. Not too many people can actually pull off jokes in religion without offending an entire crowd.I'm a loyal fan of hers and have been since her sitcom days. I look forward to checking out some other older DVDs she's done. I've seen all her new stuff and still watch ""The New Adventures of Old Christine"" just to see more of Wanda.The ""Comedy Central"" extra performance was almost as funny as the featured content (O.J. versus Bill Clinton--another good one). But I hope she never gets on Jon Stewart's show again. I've never watched it and now I know why.
