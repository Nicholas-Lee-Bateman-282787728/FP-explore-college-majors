He is a wonderful actor, and  the three actresses who played his daughters who still live at home did a good job too. Raquel Welsh was a bit &quot;out there&quot; but was not on the screen that much.Martin prepares incredibly elaborate meals...but now just for his daughters and an occasional guest. He is old-fashioned and very proud and thinks he is still taking care of his grown daughters....except that they think they are taking care of him! Despite his efforts to control the lives of those under his roof, each of the girls has her own ideas about the future.The food scenes are beautifully filmed and leave the viewers' mouths watering.

And why is it that films where one of the major supporting roles lives in a pot or a pan can'tquite get a hold of reality? Take two recent films: Lasse Hallestrom's Chocolat and Maria Ripoll's Tortilla Soup.While these two films vary greatly in subject matter, they have one thing in common: those scrumptious performances by delectable dishes. Each one used them to make the whole more lively, as metaphors or just to excite the audience's taste buds. Chocolat was a fantasy of sorts so it was allowed to get away with it. Tortilla Soup is a spicy yet often-stale film that at times seems more like a cooking show than a family comedy.Carmen (Jacqueline Obradors), Leticia (Elizabeth Pena) and Maribel (Tamara Mello) are three sisters living with their father Martin Naranjo (Hector Elizondo). Tradition is stunting the sister's growth, keeping them all in while what they really want to do is move out and become their own. Hector, however, is having his own problems. He is an excellent chef, praised by his friends to be one of the best in the world, yet his taste is failing him.Sitting on Tortilla Soup's shoulders are an angel and a devil. The angel is telling the film to go ahead and be whatever it needs to be. The angel starts off the film, giving us a cast of characters that will engage us and make us wonder just where the film is going to go. The angel also gives us some well-earned, honest laughs. Almost every little ""confession"" at the dinner table brings about a bittersweet chuckle.Hector Elizondo is a perfect fatherly figure for the three girls who are only just starting to branch off into the world. It is he who keeps the film rolling, who keeps it tight keeps it on course as long as he can. However, the devil on the other shoulder is tricky.This devil is clinging to formula. He does not want to see his precious little film escape from his clutches, so he makes sure that it will stay in la-la-land and never really get off of the ground.All in all, Tortilla Soup is fair romantic/family content that can never overcome it's own self-importance. It entertains for a while, then bids the world adieu as it spins off into a fantasy land that the filmmakers think everybody loves. Its hot-headed screenplay got to me.

Yes, it's a remake of Eat Drink Man Woman... and maybe it's not as superb as its original. But, even on its own merit, Tortilla Soup is a very enjoyable and likable movie. Hector Elizondo is wonderful as the widowed father of three grown daughters. He is also a chef, so there is a lot of wonderful food scenes in the story. The daughter characters are mostly superficially played by their respectives actresses. Raquel Welch has a sideline part as the mother of the family friend. Personally, I think she's past her prime and does a lot of overacting. For me, it is Hector Elizondo who carries the movie. I think he deserves more accolade than he gets.

This is the Mexican-American update of EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN.  The story is the same, only the language, names and food have changed.  Yet, it still manages to workm though, purests will probably find plenty of room to criticize it for being a ""knock off.""  The story follows Martin Naranjo (Hector Elizondo), a widower who was once a legendary chef at a restaurant, but has since lost his ability to taste.  Martin lives with his three adult daughters, Letitia (Elizabeth Pena), Carmen (Jacqueline Obradors) and Maribel (Tamara Mello).  As the young women start to break away from family and start lives of their own, Sunday dinners are the one ritual that keeps them connected with their father, through his luscious meals.This film is well-acted, though, I could have done without Raquel Welch in an overly melo-dramatic role, here.  She was just too shrill for my tastes, and not that entertaining.  The food scenes, on the other hand, will really draw you in.

681899,A2SRZQU1SZG4RR,B00005TNEQ,"Erika Borsos ""pepper flower""","[10, 12]","This tremendously entertaining, funny, and enjoyable film is based on the original Ang Lee production, ""Eat, Drink, Man, Woman"" which came out in 1994. While ""Tortilla Soup"" stays within the boundaries of the original screen play as written by Hui-Ling Want, Ang Lee, and James Schamus ... the differences are palpable and obvious. First, ""Tortilla Soup"" is set in California and the cultural background of the family is Mexican-American. Martin Naranjo (played to perfection by Hector Elizondo) is the retired chef and widowed father who chops, cooks, and creates the most magnificent, delicious, and spicey *Mexican* meals this side of the Rio Grande. He is the loving father of three adult daughters whom he single-handedly raised after his wife died fifteen years ago. Carmen, his oldest daughter who wanted to walk in her father's footsteps and become a chef but she ended up earning an M.B.A. in order to please him (secretly she loves to create new meals and dishes). Leticia (""Letty""), the middle daughter is more plain looking and a high school teacher whose subject is chemistry. She teaches at a public high school. Maribella, the youngest daughter is more modern and does not have a job yet. She has been accepted to the local University but is contemplating ""finding herself"" and discovering her interests .. especially after she meets Andr&eacute;, a handsome young Brazilian, living in a studio apartment, who seems to live a care-free existence in the USA.Martin loves to prepare the weekly Sunday meal where the family tradition is to gather around the table and talk. Occasionally, Yolanda, a young lady next door and her school-aged daughter April join this family feast. Yolanda's mother Hortensia arrived to help while Yolanda's divorce is finalized. Raquel Welch plays Hortensia, the sexy mature siren who notices Martin's fine qualities. She attempts to endear herself to him through her feminine wiles.The story proceeds to show how Carmen plays the ultimate free-spirited career woman, who engages in fulfilling herself on many levels but is really dissatisfied and restless. Letty is a devoted teacher whose life seems unfulfilled, so she changed religions and joined a charismatic Christian church but seems doomed to remain a single ""old maid"". Maribella, the rebellious teenager dares to announce at one of the family dinners she wants to postpone college. She even shocks her boyfriend Andr&eacute; when she says her plans are to move in with him (they had not discussed this ahead of time).Martin is called in to his former restaurant to fix a crisis because someone burned so much food, they don't know if the situation can be turned around to save the banquet. Luckily, he gets the bright idea to convert the burnt carmelized apples into a French dessert. The viewer is introduced to his good friend Gomez with whom he shares his personal feelings about life. Unfortunately, Gomez has health problems - and passes out in the kitchen of the restaurant. This situation gets Martin to think about his own health and to get his priorities in order. Carmen is contemplating moving to Barcelona, Spain to accept a dream job, even though she just bought a condo locally, with plans to live out on her own. Letty receives poetic cards left on her desk, believing they are from Orlanda Castillo, the new baseball coach at the high school. Marbella finds living with her boyfriend is not the ideal situation she had hoped it would be. All the subplots within the main story line develop unexpected twists and turns which hold the viewer's interest from start to finish. Even Martin pulls a huge surprise and makes a grand announcement at one of the family dinners, creating such a commotion that Hortensia faints. Unlike in the original film, Carmen makes one of her passionate dreams become reality. Letty's story unfolds pretty well as expected but with some new flairs and funny moments.

Aside from his superlative work as a Doctor on ""Chicago Hope"" he has been often cast as a sideman in films - the trusted aide, the sympathetic boss - but often in supporting roles.  In ""Tortilla Soup"" he takes the leading role in a Mexican-American remake of Ang Lee'sEat Drink Man Woman.He plays Martin Naranjo, a Mexican Chef so gifted that all who eat his cuisine proclaim him an artist.  The movie has delightful flourishes where we see dishes being prepared, then eaten, that are so delightful that you can almost perceive the wonderful aroma leaping from the screen.  Martin is has lost much of his sense of taste, which he thinks is a cruel irony, but his Cuban partner reminds him that Beethoven composed his greatest symphonies after he had lost the sense of hearing.  Martin also has 3 daughters who he has raised sinced becoming a widower 15 years ago.  Elizabeth Pena is Leticia, the pious schoolteacher who is invited to ask the blessing prior to the family meals although she turns a simple ""grace"" into mini-sermons.  Jacqueline Obradors is the saucy Carmen, who was encouraged to get her MBA by Martin, but has difficulty balancing the borderline ethics of large business deals with her growing realization that she is not pursuing her passion - as her father did with his wondrous cooking.  Tamara Mello is the youngest Maribel who finds herself torn between the pressure to go to college and to ""find herself"".  Constance Marie is family friend Yolando, who is the same age as the older sisters and is coming to the end of a dissatisfying marriage with a young daughter who Martin dotes on.  Raquel Welch is Yolando's mother, Hortensia, who is also without a man and plainly has designs on the compassionate and accomplished Martin.The film depicts the evolution of these various characters as they come to terms with the progression of their love lives and professions.  At the beginning of the film all of the characters are single.  By the end they've all been paired off in one manner or another, some in a manner more satisfyingly realistic than others.

This film is very much like &quot;Soul Food&quot; in that most of the action revolves around the dinner table with luscious-looking food designed and prepared by the &quot;Hot Tamales&quot; of Food TV fame. And like Ang Lee's film all the daughters and their father are searching for love, happiness and contentment.Aren't we all? There is no violence except for a few dishes that get broken. In fact nothing much happens except we are made privy to several interesting people and watch as they conduct their lives in a rich, deep and fulfilling manner. Besides Elizondo who always does a great job, the standout performance has to be Jacqueline Obrados as Carmen. Keep your eyes open in the future as I'm sure we are going to see great things from her. An interesting note: Nikolai Kinski, grandson of the famous Klaus and son of the also famous Nastassia plays Maribel's boyfriend, Andy. That's three generations of Kinski's now in the movies and Nikolai makes a good impression in a basic no frills role. Food means love, sharing and camaraderie in &quot;Tortilla Soup,&quot; (Mexican characters) as it did in &quot;Soul Food&quot;(African-American characters) and &quot;Eat Drink Man Woman&quot; (Taiwanese characters).

The cooking is all Mexican, and the family that gathers around the table to enjoy it, while squabbling all the while, is Mexican-American - a widowed father and his three grown daughters. Meanwhile, the presence or absence of romantic partners is a common topic of discussion and a prime motivator of most of the action in the film, so that cooking, eating and love in its many forms become all part of what draws and holds everyone together.It's definitely a feel-good movie that sidesteps just about every inconvenient fact of life for Mexican-Americans living in Los Angeles. The music track is upbeat and joyous, and characters have a way of breaking into song, singing Spanglish versions of ""Quizas, Perhaps, Quizas."" Hector Elizondo is wonderful as the rock-steady father of this clan, and Elizabeth Pe&ntilde;a as his born-again unmarried daughter is all barely contained passion seething beneath a pious exterior. In noteworthy supporting roles, Raquel Welch gets to raise temperatures as an overbearing oft-wed neighbor on the prowl for another mate, and Julio Oscar Mechoso turns in an endearing performance as an assistant chef and close friend of the family.

All said and done, Tortilla Soup is still a fabulous feast of cooking, food, love, values.Set in some Mexican part of LA, this is a movie about, of course, food. But just bubbling under the comic surface are half a dozen more sombre themes involving how food brings us together and how it changes in tune with culture, sibling rivalry, personal freedom, ambition etc etc.Yet, the execution is thankfully sunny and quick so it never gets ho-hum. If nothing else, I bet it'll make you crave for some Mexican food.
