It looked great on the cover, but I know that's not a good indication that the movie is any good.  Let's just say that this movie was action packed, colorful, and interesting to watch.Not your typical high school student.  There was indeed something special about Duncan.  He reminded me of Clark Kent as a teenager in the tv series, ""Smallville"", who tried to lead a normal life with all those powers.  Here he was the new kid in school, but immediately became the target of some bullies in his classroom. He was a good kid, but did have a temper that had to stay under wraps.  Surely it would be hard with bullies making life hard for him to stay in control. Of course mom was his protector and wanted him to fit in, but allowed him to make decisions that would make him a better person.  I found it weird that the father was not human.  Maybe he was human once, and was turned into this creature.  Or maybe he could change from human to creature.  I don't remember if anything was addressed about how he came to be Duncan's father.The story line was good and easy to follow.  Every main character part was fitting and well acted.  Not a dull moment.  I found myself drawn into the characters and story.  As one viewer pointed out, it wasn't long enough.  I wanted to see more action and additional story lines.  Would be great if it were a series.",4,Pretty Good CGI Cartoon,1344384000,"08 8, 2012",2012,1455,"['had', 'never', 'heard', 'movie', 'before', 'reviews', 'decided', 'purchase', 'was', '5.00', 'looked', 'great', 'cover', 'know', 'not', 'good', 'indication', 'movie', 'good', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'movie', 'was', 'action', 'packed', 'colorful', 'interesting', 'watch.Not', 'typical', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'was', 'indeed', 'something', 'special', 'Duncan', 'reminded', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'teenager', 'tv', 'series', 'Smallville', 'who', 'tried', 'lead', 'normal', 'life', 'powers', 'Here', 'was', 'new', 'kid', 'school', 'immediately', 'became', 'target', 'bullies', 'classroom', 'was', 'good', 'kid', 'did', 'have', 'temper', 'had', 'stay', 'wraps', 'Surely', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'bullies', 'making', 'life', 'hard', 'stay', 'control', 'course', 'mom', 'was', 'protector', 'wanted', 'fit', 'allowed', 'make', 'decisions', 'would', 'make', 'better', 'person', 'found', 'father', 'was', 'not', 'human', 'Maybe', 'was', 'human', 'once', 'was', 'turned', 'creature', 'maybe', 'could', 'change', 'human', 'creature', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'anything', 'was', 'addressed', 'how', 'came', 'be', 'Duncan', 'father.The', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'good', 'easy', 'follow', 'main', 'character', 'part', 'was', 'fitting', 'well', 'acted', 'Not', 'dull', 'moment', 'found', 'drawn', 'characters', 'story', 'one', 'viewer', 'pointed', 'out', 'was', ""n't"", 'long', 'enough', 'wanted', 'see', 'more', 'action', 'additional', 'story', 'lines', 'Would', 'be', 'great', 'were', 'series']",N/A
1407576,A2RVCF21L2NPU5,B004GZZGXG,"Cherise Kachelmuss ""Mom and More""","[1, 2]","I had never seen or heard of Firebreather before watching this DVD, but after seeing the cover of the DVD I knew my boys would like it.  The DVD is about Duncan Rosenblatt who is a typical high school student or so you think.  He is half-Kaiju, a race of hundred foot tall monsters who are fighting for control of the planet.  Duncan is stuck between his Kaiju dad and his normal mom, and living the life of a typical teenager.  Even though I am not really into monsters, I liked this movie and so did my boys (2 and 4 years old.)  There is a dragon which may be scary to some young kids, but my boys didn't mind it. I can definitly see future DVDs for Firebreather as Duncan continues to fight for Earth but still be true to who he is.Firebreather is set in CGI animation which is actually really good.  I mean it is no Disney or Pixar but it is also not cheesy or low budget looking.  Overall, I have no complaints about this DVD and look forward to more.  I think Firebreather could definitely appeal to a wide range of age groups too, even though my 2 year old didn't understand the whole Kaiju part he liked watching it.  I also think the 69 minutes is a great length to keep kids entertained.Mom and More Disclosure: I was sent this DVD to review in exchange for my honest opinion.",5,Worth checking out!,1301097600,"03 26, 2011",2011,1287,"['had', 'never', 'seen', 'heard', 'Firebreather', 'watching', 'DVD', 'seeing', 'cover', 'DVD', 'knew', 'boys', 'would', 'like', 'DVD', 'Duncan', 'Rosenblatt', 'who', 'typical', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'so', 'think', 'half-Kaiju', 'race', 'hundred', 'foot', 'tall', 'monsters', 'who', 'are', 'fighting', 'control', 'planet', 'Duncan', 'stuck', 'Kaiju', 'dad', 'normal', 'mom', 'living', 'life', 'typical', 'teenager', 'Even', 'am', 'not', 'really', 'monsters', 'liked', 'movie', 'so', 'did', 'boys', '2', '4', 'years', 'old', 'dragon', 'may', 'be', 'scary', 'young', 'kids', 'boys', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'can', 'definitly', 'see', 'future', 'DVDs', 'Firebreather', 'Duncan', 'fight', 'Earth', 'still', 'be', 'true', 'who', 'is.Firebreather', 'set', 'CGI', 'animation', 'actually', 'really', 'good', 'mean', 'Disney', 'Pixar', 'also', 'not', 'cheesy', 'low', 'budget', 'looking', 'Overall', 'have', 'complaints', 'DVD', 'look', 'forward', 'more', 'think', 'Firebreather', 'could', 'definitely', 'appeal', 'wide', 'range', 'age', 'groups', 'too', 'even', '2', 'year', 'old', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'whole', 'Kaiju', 'part', 'liked', 'watching', 'also', 'think', '69', 'minutes', 'great', 'length', 'keep', 'kids', 'entertained.Mom', 'More', 'Disclosure', 'was', 'sent', 'DVD', 'review', 'exchange', 'honest', 'opinion']",N/A

The cg animation is great while stiff at times & the story's intriguing enough to get the attention of kids & adults alike. Phil Hester and Andy Kuhn's comic book is amazing but still, it's a nice touch that Peter Chung of Aeon Flux fame is in the director's chair for this with his knack for keen action visuals with that artsy touch. I thought this would at least warrant a sequel but it's turned out to be quite a sleeper hit. Personally Firebreather is like a cross between Image Comics' Invincible & the anime-manga Devilman.

Despite his mother's attempted encouragement, he KNOWS that it's hopeless:His skin is bright orange.He eats coal for lunch.In addition there are the famous family members he'd rather people didn't know about.  Sixteen years ago his insanely brave mother, Margaret Rosenblatt, saved the world by stopping mankind's war with the Kaiju, essentially the city destroying giant monsters that for some reason always seem to start with Tokyo.Duncan's father?  Oh, he's Belloc, the 120-foot-tall, fire breathing, King of the Kaiju....Exactly how that worked is not explained.  Duncan's Mom OFFERS to explain it to him, but Duncan would really rather not know.  However, it does appear to have involved true love that later died, perhaps because of irreconcilable differences over how to raise the child:  Margaret wants him to go to college; Belloc wants him to rule the Kaiju (and by extension the World).Still, given those gloomy prospects, things don't go THAT badly on his first day.  Duncan (literally) runs into the hottest girl in school, attracts the attentions of another girl who happens to be a Kaiju fangirl, protects a smaller kid from a bunch of bullies, makes enemies of said bullies and leads them a merry chase (because he promised his mother not to get into any fights on his first day), and accidentally manifests a new talent:fire breathing.Oh well, it could have been worse.  Unfortunately, it is about to GET worse....""Daddy"" is back in town.Based somewhat loosely on the Image Comics comic book of the same name:Firebreather Volume 1: Growing PainsandFirebreather Volume 2: All The Best Heroes Are Orphans, this is one of the best things I've ever seen on the Cartoon Network, and that is saying something.  The CG animation was good if perhaps not state of the art, but the best part IMHO was the writing.  In particular I enjoyed the byplay between Belloc and Margaret, two characters who still care for each other, have no intention of admitting it, but cannot hide it from even the most clueless observer....

Duncan is the only one who can bring the two worlds together and make peace between them. There are exciting battles, and touching moments where he learns about his father and himself. Throughout the movie you feel the main characters conflict and he fights to stay human, but eventually learns to accept both parts of himself.  Duncan is part human, part dragon, and all hero. The whole story line is exciting and original. My kids are eight and ten, so they were the perfect age for this movie.

But like any normal red-blooded American teen he has eyes for the pretty cool girl and through a series of misadventures, including being confronted by his monstrous father in a mesa Arizona type setting, becomes the hero and gets the girl.  But he has to battle and survive some literally big competition as he helps avoid the monster-human apocalypse that comes close to being unleashed.This movie was created for the Godzilla & ""Pacific Rim"" crowds.
