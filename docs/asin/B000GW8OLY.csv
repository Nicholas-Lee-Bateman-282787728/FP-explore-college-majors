1007658,A35VG5NCAWKUI,B000GW8OLY,bz,"[15, 20]","This is a very nice box set.  If you don't want to wait for the rerun from TV, this box set is a pretty good bargain for $30 bucks.  There are some extra in the set but nothing is special.  I would like to see some interview with the casts but there is none in this box set.The package is ok but it is kinda tough to get the disc out. You can easily break the disc when you try to ""pry"" it out from the case.Story wise, I am sorry to say that there isn't anything new added to the TV series. The movies are just yet another side quests. They are ok but not great. If you have seen it once, you have seen it all kinda thing.The only thing I don't like about the movies is that the characters from the first 3 movies are not drawn like the original characters from the TV series.  The characters from the first 3 movies look ... just look bad.  The characters from the TV series are full of life with emotion you can see from their facial expression. They are very well animated for TV.  Unfortunately, the characters from the movies are like bad cartoons that are badly animated (rather than good ""anime"").  For instance, Kagura looks like a kid from Gundam Seed rather than looks like a beautiful woman from the TV series.  Lord Sesshomaru doesn't look like a ""lord"". He looks like a punk instead.  The 4th movie, on the other hand, is a little bit better animated and look closer to the characters from the TV series.So, this set is a good bargain but the movies itself is just so-so.",3,Good Bargain,1193097600,"10 23, 2007",2007,1485,"['very', 'nice', 'box', 'set', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'wait', 'rerun', 'TV', 'box', 'set', 'pretty', 'good', 'bargain', '30', 'bucks', 'are', 'extra', 'set', 'nothing', 'special', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'interview', 'casts', 'none', 'box', 'set.The', 'package', 'ok', 'kinda', 'tough', 'get', 'disc', 'out', 'can', 'easily', 'break', 'disc', 'when', 'try', 'pry', 'case.Story', 'wise', 'am', 'sorry', 'say', ""n't"", 'anything', 'new', 'added', 'TV', 'series', 'movies', 'are', 'just', 'yet', 'side', 'quests', 'are', 'ok', 'not', 'great', 'have', 'seen', 'once', 'have', 'seen', 'kinda', 'thing.The', 'only', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'movies', 'characters', 'first', '3', 'movies', 'are', 'not', 'drawn', 'original', 'characters', 'TV', 'series', 'characters', 'first', '3', 'movies', 'look', 'just', 'look', 'bad', 'characters', 'TV', 'series', 'are', 'full', 'life', 'emotion', 'can', 'see', 'facial', 'expression', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'animated', 'TV', 'Unfortunately', 'characters', 'movies', 'are', 'bad', 'cartoons', 'are', 'badly', 'animated', 'rather', 'good', 'anime', 'instance', 'Kagura', 'kid', 'Gundam', 'Seed', 'rather', 'looks', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'TV', 'series', 'Lord', 'Sesshomaru', ""n't"", 'look', 'lord', 'punk', 'instead', '4th', 'movie', 'other', 'hand', 'little', 'bit', 'better', 'animated', 'look', 'closer', 'characters', 'TV', 'series.So', 'set', 'good', 'bargain', 'movies', 'just', 'so-so']",N/A

The only thing that irritates me after a while is when the keep screaming out each other's names INYASHAAAAA!!!!!  KAGOMAAAAAAA!!!!  That gets tiring other wise there are some good movies in there.  The same technque was use in doing pokemon I think.  The pokemon the character would call their name and the pokemon would talk by saying there name over and over.  I just that must be some technique to keep you from forgetting about them  :-)  I would recommend the box set if you like animation.

So, this gift for my grandson, for whom these were purchased and who loves Inuyasha too, will take care of that! I found my adult daughter, who also likes the show, an entire Inuyasha Halloween outfit...complete with the long white wig, necklace, sword, and ears. I found it online and very reasonable-from China. Ordered early and it arrived in time! The relationship between Inuyasha, Kagome, Kikyo, and Miroku and friends is complex and endearing. The ""faname"" is also interesting. His being half demon/ half human causes an internal war as to  whether to be a demon or not while his on-going conflict and competition with his full demon brother Sesshomaru seems never-ending. His mortal enemy Naroku and how Kikiyo is something both of them have in common is another angle to the story. Once aware of the storyline, its easy to get wrapped up in the series. I had the complete boxed set of the series but my grandson borrowed it and lost some discs. Looking for a reasonably-priced replacement...not easy to find.

You get all 4 movies for $30, with some fun extras and the options of watching in Japanese or English.  There is another movie box set out there that is much more expensive and the only difference is a set of soundtrack CDs.  The soundtrack is pretty impressive, but wasn't necessary for my personal use.The movies themselves are fun - much like longer filler episode arcs with interesting villains and story lines.  It's not meant to help the Naraku storyline progress, but you'll be in for some fun (especially if, like me, you've already watched the InuYasha TV episodes multiple times and are looking for something new and fun starring your favorite dog demon and Japanese school girl.)The animation is different from the TV show - to me the characters look more ""cutesy"" but my husband, who is not that interested in the InuYasha series, enjoyed watching some of the major battle scenes and thought that the battle sequences were animated better.Now all we have to do is wait for that final end-all fifth InuYasha movie, and we'll all be happy.  :)",5,What a great deal!,1194220800,"11 5, 2007",2007,1139,"['such', 'great', 'deal', 'considering', 'movie', 'sold', 'own', '15', 'get', '4', 'movies', '30', 'fun', 'extras', 'options', 'watching', 'Japanese', 'English', 'movie', 'box', 'set', 'out', 'much', 'more', 'expensive', 'only', 'difference', 'set', 'soundtrack', 'CDs', 'soundtrack', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'was', ""n't"", 'necessary', 'personal', 'use.The', 'movies', 'are', 'fun', 'much', 'longer', 'filler', 'episode', 'arcs', 'interesting', 'villains', 'story', 'lines', 'not', 'meant', 'help', 'Naraku', 'storyline', 'progress', ""'ll"", 'be', 'fun', 'especially', ""'ve"", 'already', 'watched', 'InuYasha', 'TV', 'multiple', 'times', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'new', 'fun', 'starring', 'favorite', 'dog', 'demon', 'Japanese', 'school', 'girl', 'animation', 'different', 'TV', 'show', 'characters', 'look', 'more', 'cutesy', 'husband', 'who', 'not', 'interested', 'InuYasha', 'series', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'major', 'battle', 'scenes', 'thought', 'battle', 'sequences', 'were', 'animated', 'better.Now', 'have', 'do', 'wait', 'final', 'end-all', 'fifth', 'InuYasha', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'be', 'happy']",N/A
