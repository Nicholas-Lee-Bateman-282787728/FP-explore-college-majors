Everyone has thoughts on the death penalty, and this one helps to think it through, and whether one is for or against, at least we must think through why we are of the mindset we are. A great movie, parts of it are graphic, but definitely worth the time to see it.",4,Definitely food for thought!,1400716800,"05 22, 2014",2014,379,"['am', 'James', 'Woods', 'fan', 'already', 'was', 'great', 'performance', 'man', 'death', 'row', 'mind', 'killer', 'Everyone', 'thoughts', 'death', 'penalty', 'one', 'think', 'one', 'least', 'must', 'think', 'why', 'are', 'mindset', 'are', 'A', 'great', 'movie', 'parts', 'are', 'graphic', 'definitely', 'time', 'see']",Killer a Journal of Murder VHS

It's really a compelling piece.I've been reading true crime books for over ten years now and have always been curious about Carl Panzram. While this film does not explore his early life and crimes in great detail, it is a fascinating and thought-provoking look at not only his final years, but also crime and punishment (and, more specifically, the American criminal justice system) in the twentieth century.For those serial killer buffs looking for a cheesy gorefest filled with torture and nudity, you will be very disappointed in Killer: A Journal of Murder. However, for those who are truly interested in the deeper, more intriguing aspects of Carl Panzram, this film is right up your alley.The script, which is based on the book of the same name, is simply amazing. The dialogue, particularly between Lesser and Panzram (the two main characters) is nothing short of poetry. The rights words and acting is what makes this film work. Why, you ask? Because the driving force of this film is the complex and fascinating relationship between Lesser and Panzram. Sure, there are other things that make this story worth telling, but without the odd friendship between prisoner and guard, this film would not be as unique or interesting.Legendary actor James Woods and Robert Sean Leonard, who is now well known for his role on Fox's House MD, both give great performances worthy of praise. At times (mainly in the beginning of the film), Woods seems to oversell it, but for the most part, he is perfect. Leonard's ability to play a decent, honest man who finds himself befriending and assisting a multiple rapist/thief/murderer, while battling his inner morals that are pulling him in both directions and, to boot, putting his marriage and job on the line, is just incredible. The inner tension, humanity, and humility in his character is easy to see, thanks to Leonard. While there are no performances worth complaining about, perhaps the stand-out actor in this film would have to be John Bedford Lloyd, who is magnificent as Dr. Karl Menninger. While only in front of the camera for a few minutes, this underrated and relatively unknown veteran actor proves that stars aren't always the ones that steal the show.In all, this is a great film. Even if you're not a true crime buff, the dynamic and dramatic relationship between Panzram and Lesser is something that the best screenwriters on earth would kill for. Sometimes, a good work of non-fiction is just what you need to create a piece of cinematic art.",4,Pleasantly surprised and impressed,1387152000,"12 16, 2013",2013,2620,"['was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'awful', 'movie', 'means', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'film', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'was', 'really', 'compelling', 'piece.I', ""'ve"", 'been', 'reading', 'true', 'crime', 'books', 'ten', 'years', 'now', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'curious', 'Carl', 'Panzram', 'film', 'not', 'explore', 'early', 'life', 'crimes', 'great', 'detail', 'fascinating', 'thought-provoking', 'look', 'not', 'only', 'final', 'years', 'also', 'crime', 'punishment', 'more', 'specifically', 'American', 'criminal', 'justice', 'system', 'twentieth', 'century.For', 'serial', 'killer', 'buffs', 'looking', 'cheesy', 'gorefest', 'filled', 'torture', 'nudity', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'disappointed', 'Killer', 'Journal', 'Murder', 'However', 'who', 'are', 'truly', 'interested', 'deeper', 'more', 'intriguing', 'aspects', 'Carl', 'Panzram', 'film', 'right', 'alley.The', 'script', 'based', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'simply', 'amazing', 'dialogue', 'particularly', 'Lesser', 'Panzram', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'nothing', 'short', 'poetry', 'rights', 'words', 'acting', 'what', 'film', 'work', 'Why', 'ask', 'driving', 'force', 'film', 'complex', 'fascinating', 'relationship', 'Lesser', 'Panzram', 'Sure', 'are', 'other', 'things', 'make', 'story', 'worth', 'telling', 'odd', 'friendship', 'prisoner', 'guard', 'film', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'unique', 'interesting.Legendary', 'actor', 'James', 'Woods', 'Robert', 'Sean', 'Leonard', 'who', 'now', 'well', 'known', 'role', 'Fox', 'House', 'MD', 'give', 'great', 'performances', 'worthy', 'praise', 'times', 'mainly', 'beginning', 'film', 'Woods', 'oversell', 'most', 'part', 'perfect', 'Leonard', 'ability', 'play', 'decent', 'honest', 'man', 'who', 'befriending', 'assisting', 'multiple', 'rapist/thief/murderer', 'battling', 'inner', 'morals', 'are', 'pulling', 'directions', 'boot', 'putting', 'marriage', 'job', 'line', 'just', 'incredible', 'inner', 'tension', 'humanity', 'humility', 'character', 'easy', 'see', 'thanks', 'Leonard', 'are', 'performances', 'complaining', 'perhaps', 'stand-out', 'actor', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'John', 'Bedford', 'Lloyd', 'who', 'magnificent', 'Dr.', 'Karl', 'Menninger', 'only', 'front', 'camera', 'few', 'minutes', 'underrated', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'veteran', 'actor', 'stars', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'ones', 'steal', 'show.In', 'great', 'film', 'Even', ""'re"", 'not', 'true', 'crime', 'buff', 'dynamic', 'dramatic', 'relationship', 'Panzram', 'Lesser', 'something', 'best', 'screenwriters', 'earth', 'would', 'kill', 'Sometimes', 'good', 'work', 'non-fiction', 'just', 'what', 'need', 'create', 'piece', 'cinematic', 'art']",Killer a Journal of Murder VHS

It doesn't really dwelve into the mind of a killerlike other movies.  But it's still pretty interesting and the viewer never really wants to stop watching it. The heart of the film is intriguing: A young gaurd is fascinated by the perverse and dark life of the most dangerous man in the prison. The screenplay is vicious and gritty (even a nice librarian gets raped) and the characters though not perfect, are still well-written to a certain extent. I wasn't riveted, but I was interested and it did make me think for a while. This is more about the lure of evil and it's mechanics and maybe even redemption. Not a masterpiece, but still a good film.",3,"Not Completely Convincing, But Still Well-Done.",942710400,"11 16, 1999",1999,726,"['quot', 'Killer', 'Journal', 'Murder', 'quot', 'not', 'as', 'deep', 'itpretends', 'be', ""n't"", 'really', 'dwelve', 'mind', 'killerlike', 'other', 'movies', 'still', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'viewer', 'never', 'really', 'stop', 'watching', 'heart', 'film', 'intriguing', 'young', 'gaurd', 'fascinated', 'perverse', 'dark', 'life', 'most', 'dangerous', 'man', 'prison', 'screenplay', 'vicious', 'gritty', 'even', 'nice', 'librarian', 'raped', 'characters', 'not', 'perfect', 'are', 'still', 'well-written', 'certain', 'extent', 'was', ""n't"", 'riveted', 'was', 'interested', 'did', 'make', 'think', 'while', 'more', 'lure', 'evil', 'mechanics', 'maybe', 'even', 'redemption', 'Not', 'masterpiece', 'still', 'good', 'film']",Killer a Journal of Murder VHS
410271,A2PN7Z2VTHICL8,630426710X,"Schtinky ""Schtinky""","[3, 3]","Carl Panzram (the talented James Woods) is arrested and jailed for theft, but while in prison confesses to killing 21 men (while being beaten by the prison guards).  Newly appointed prison guard Henry Lesser (Robert Sean Leonard) feels sorry for Carl after seeing how badly he's been beaten, and gives the prisoner a dollar (a lot of money back in the 1920's).  Thus starts up a very strange friendship.Lesser, against the rules, provides Carl with pencil and paper for Carl to write down his life story.  We're taken back through Carl's life, mostly with flashbacks, to the mayhem his life had been.  It seems the only time he attempted normal behavior was under a warden named Casey who actually trusted Carl until Carl, while out on one of his daytime trips, rapes an innocent librarian (played by Ellen Greene - Little Shop Of Horrors).While 'Killer' isn't a fast paced movie, it's nonetheless a very good movie.  James Woods plays his role as a sociopath to perfection.  The use of occasional black-and-white photography, the costume design, the props, and the old stills really create the atmosphere of the era.  The dialogue is sharp and realistic.  (Carl: ""I do not intend to plead for pity or sympathy or mercy.  What I demand is justice.  You created me.  Now you kill me."")  The scene where the preacher comes to Carl's cell is priceless.Overall, if you liked 'The Green Mile' or just like James Woods' work, you should pick up or rent a copy of this film.  Though obviously low budget, it works very well.
