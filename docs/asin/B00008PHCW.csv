You Probably will be Dissapointed with this Movie.IF, However, you would be Interested in Seeing the First Signs of his Raw (dare I say ""Abrasive""?) Humor ?? You Could Very Well Find this Movie Interesting. He DOES Do SOME (not all) of his Perverted Nursery Ryhmes, but he sings them in a Sort of RAP Style which at Best is Different or Amusing and at Worst Annoying and Blows the Whole Thing. Again this is VERY EARLY Work of His and it would seem to hold out, He Learned it Flopped and Changed his act up to make that part more Funny (IMO).One of the Highlights of the whole thing is, either by Plan, or due to him running out of Material ??, he opens the floor up to Questions and does a Great Job of Improv in Answering them INCLUDING One Poor Slob who decided to Heckle Him and, Lets just say he Limped away after being Verbally Abused in True Dice Style.SO, If you are Looking for a ""Best Of Dice"" Movie with all his Famous Stuff ? this is NOT what you want.If you want to see the first steps of a Comic who Pushed Boundaries and made people Laugh and UnComfortable at the same time ? this is what you were Looking for.",3,"Probably NOT the ""Dice"" you are thinking of",1140566400,"02 22, 2006",2006,1252,"['VERY', 'OLD', 'film', 'A.D.C', 'Dice', 'Probably', 'First', 'Recording', 'are', 'Looking', 'Signature', 'lines', 'flow', 'Probably', 'will', 'be', 'Dissapointed', 'Movie.IF', 'However', 'would', 'be', 'Interested', 'Seeing', 'First', 'Signs', 'Raw', 'dare', 'say', 'Abrasive', 'Humor', 'Could', 'Very', 'Well', 'Movie', 'Interesting', 'Do', 'SOME', 'not', 'Perverted', 'Nursery', 'Ryhmes', 'Sort', 'RAP', 'Style', 'Best', 'Different', 'Amusing', 'Worst', 'Annoying', 'Blows', 'Whole', 'Thing', 'Again', 'VERY', 'EARLY', 'Work', 'would', 'seem', 'hold', 'out', 'Learned', 'Flopped', 'Changed', 'act', 'make', 'part', 'more', 'Funny', 'IMO', '.One', 'Highlights', 'whole', 'thing', 'either', 'Plan', 'due', 'running', 'Material', 'floor', 'up', 'Questions', 'Great', 'Job', 'Improv', 'Answering', 'INCLUDING', 'One', 'Poor', 'Slob', 'who', 'decided', 'Heckle', 'Him', 'just', 'say', 'Limped', 'away', 'being', 'Verbally', 'Abused', 'True', 'Dice', 'Style.SO', 'are', 'Looking', 'Best', 'Dice', 'Movie', 'Famous', 'Stuff', 'NOT', 'what', 'want.If', 'want', 'see', 'first', 'steps', 'Comic', 'who', 'Pushed', 'Boundaries', 'made', 'people', 'Laugh', 'UnComfortable', 'same', 'time', 'what', 'were', 'Looking']",N/A
