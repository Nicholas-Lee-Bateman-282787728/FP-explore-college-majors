From the very first eruption, through dams breaking, floods destroying bridges, and a stupdendous pyroclastic flow, it's some of the best effects I've ever seen in a disaster movie.Unfortunately, there's a story that comes with it; even more unfortunately, some lamebrain decided to included DIALOGUE. God help us.Whoever wrote the screenplay must have a pretty low opinion of the intelligence of the human species -- and especially of women. First, there's Marion, Brosnan's first love. Marion loves volcanoes, and is so much of an expert that when she sees that the volcano she's sitting on is about to blow, she wants to stay (""we can't leave now; look at these readings!"") Uh , Marion, have you considered that the readings are saying that it's time to, oh, I don't know... RUN??!! No matter, she doesn't last long.Then there's Grandma. Boy, if there was ever a senior who deserved to be put away, it's this nut. Don't ever trust someone in their seventies who says ""hot nookie"" in front of the grandkids. She also refuses to come off of her volcano when it's ready to explode. Maybe it's something in the water.My favorite line, however, comes from our heroine. She's sitting out on her front porch one warm summer evening, her soon-to-be beau Brosnan by her side, her two sweet children asleep in her beds. Brosnan has told her the explosion could come any time now.She stares up at the volcano and murmurs ""I hope you're wrong about our volcano, Harry -- but if you're right, I'm glad you're here."" Aw[...] That's nice. Of course, any decent mother would have gotten her kids on the first bus out of town... something she apparently never thought of. She also thanked Brosnan for saving her son's life by making him some eggplant parmegiana. It must be one hell of an eggplant parmegiana.Throw in the greedy businessman, the chicken boss, a helicopter pilot who apparently was out the day they taught you not to fly in ash, and you have the townspeople of Dante's Peak. Happily, you get to see a fantastic volcanic explosion AND the reassurance that these nitwits won't pass on their dna. That alone is worth three stars.",3,"Fantastic special effects, but...",1123545600,"08 9, 2005",2005,2182,"['Okay', 'first', 'special', 'effects', ""'re"", 'outstanding', 'very', 'first', 'eruption', 'dams', 'breaking', 'floods', 'destroying', 'bridges', 'stupdendous', 'pyroclastic', 'flow', 'best', 'effects', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'disaster', 'movie.Unfortunately', 'story', 'even', 'more', 'unfortunately', 'lamebrain', 'decided', 'included', 'DIALOGUE', 'God', 'help', 'us.Whoever', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'must', 'have', 'pretty', 'low', 'opinion', 'intelligence', 'human', 'species', 'especially', 'women', 'First', 'Marion', 'Brosnan', 'first', 'love', 'Marion', 'volcanoes', 'so', 'much', 'expert', 'when', 'volcano', 'sitting', 'blow', 'stay', 'ca', ""n't"", 'leave', 'now', 'look', 'readings', 'Uh', 'Marion', 'have', 'considered', 'readings', 'are', 'saying', 'time', 'oh', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'RUN', 'matter', ""n't"", 'last', 'long.Then', 'Grandma', 'Boy', 'was', 'ever', 'senior', 'who', 'deserved', 'be', 'put', 'away', 'nut', 'Do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'trust', 'someone', 'seventies', 'who', 'hot', 'nookie', 'front', 'grandkids', 'also', 'come', 'volcano', 'when', 'ready', 'explode', 'Maybe', 'something', 'water.My', 'favorite', 'line', 'however', 'heroine', 'sitting', 'out', 'front', 'porch', 'one', 'warm', 'summer', 'evening', 'soon-to-be', 'beau', 'Brosnan', 'side', 'two', 'sweet', 'children', 'asleep', 'beds', 'Brosnan', 'told', 'explosion', 'could', 'come', 'time', 'now.She', 'up', 'volcano', 'hope', ""'re"", 'wrong', 'volcano', 'Harry', ""'re"", 'right', ""'m"", 'glad', ""'re"", 'here', 'Aw', '[', ']', 'nice', 'course', 'decent', 'mother', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'kids', 'first', 'bus', 'town', 'something', 'apparently', 'never', 'thought', 'also', 'thanked', 'Brosnan', 'saving', 'son', 'life', 'making', 'eggplant', 'parmegiana', 'must', 'be', 'one', 'hell', 'eggplant', 'parmegiana.Throw', 'greedy', 'businessman', 'chicken', 'boss', 'helicopter', 'pilot', 'who', 'apparently', 'was', 'out', 'day', 'taught', 'not', 'fly', 'ash', 'have', 'townspeople', 'Dante', 'Peak', 'Happily', 'get', 'see', 'fantastic', 'volcanic', 'explosion', 'reassurance', 'nitwits', 'wo', ""n't"", 'pass', 'dna', 'alone', 'worth', 'three', 'stars']",N/A

Not only is St Helens referred to verbally at least 3 times in the movie, but much of the on location filming took place at St Helens summit and crater. I can say this with confidence as I climbed her back in 2003, and I'd know the view anywhere. They even have a stubborn elderly resident (Linda Hamiltons' mother-in-law) who lives up on the mountain (about the same distance as Harry Truman lived) and refuses to evacuate, thus giving us the indispensable, if not very watered down, Harry truman character. Although the dialogue gets unbearably corny at times, I gave this 5 stars because its great entertainment.

The setting is very attractive, beautiful country, just the kind of place to take a vacation.  But danger lurks above the town, and as with most disaster films, the danger is not long in coming.  The special effects are in my view first rate.  Although some of the scenes with the main characters are totally beyond belief.  The scene with the pick-up truck driving through the lava field, and not exploding, was laughable at best.  The grandmother dragging the boat through the acid filled lake, really stretches reality.  But all in all a very entertaining film, a little slow at the start, but once the volcano starts rumbling, things do get interesting.  This film is worth buying in my opinion just for the special effects alone.  Just suspend belief and enjoy it.

49540,A3TNM3C9ENUCFW,0783222475,"A.M.Boughey ""Poetmaster""","[2, 2]","Pierce Brosnan is the main reason for recommending this movie, (although the whole movie does have a polished feel) as a battle hardened Vulcanologist sent to investigate some unusual readings in peaceful upper Washington State. Soon after his arrival he becomes alarmed at what he discovers, and dutifully informs the authorities of impending disaster who choose (of course) to ignore him, in time honored fashion. Although you know pretty much what is going to happen thereafter, this movie is pretty gripping, and was arguably better than ""Volcano"" with Tommy Lee Jones, which was released around the same time. Yes, it's riddled with cliches, and has an essential mixture of characters you might find in any disaster based story, but it has a certain something that gives it a more dramatic feel. Linda Hamilton of Terminator fame is the love interest/only person sensible enough to believe Mr Brosnan, and around the mid way point the story changes (reliably almost) into an escape flick. One or two scenes of intense peril, make this unsuitable for smaller children, but otherwise it's fairly tame. Considering the year of production the special effects are pretty amazing, and the acting all round adds more than credibility to the storyline. Although others will I'm sure disagree, this is a far better picture than say, the more recent Day After Tomorrow for not relying solely on good visuals, and is testament to the fact that a good story, makes for a good movie. Worth a revisit even if you've seen it before, and a decent amount of extra's on the DVD make it worth a purchase.

49542,AK6UVFSU07NXH,0783222475,Anthony Hinde,"[0, 0]","When &quot;Dante's Peak&quot; was released I wasn't sure whether to see it straight away or wait until Volcano also came out. That way I could choose to see whichever film  got more of the popular vote. In the end, my natural  impatience won out and I went to see Dante's Peak. And as it turned out,  Volcano was a joke compared to Roger Donaldson's creation, so I made the  right choice.If any of you have read a Desmond Bagley novel,  you'll know what Dante's Peak is like. Slow to build up the pressure.  Dropping suspenseful hints left right and centre, and finally exploding  into an orgy of action that doesn't seem to stop. So naturally, to pull it  all off, a couple of top-flight action stars where needed.Pierce  Brosnan (Goldeney, The Thomas Crown Affair), plays Harry Dalton, a  volcanologist sent to investigate some strange measurements coming out of  Dante's Peak. Linda Hamilton (Terminator), is Rachel Wando, the town's  mayor and mother of two modern children, who are just waiting for a father  figure to  enter their lives. Bring Linda and Harry together and  significant glances start to fly, squeezed in amongst the flying lava of  course.The story is fairly straight-forward. You have an expert  that has a &quot;bad feeling&quot; about the mountain, up against a town  that would much rather have cocktails with investors than review the  emergency plan. Even Harry's own team of geologists, don't want to rock the  boat before they see the whole lake rocking. But it's not the story that  makes this movie so good, it's the situation.As in so much of  history, we humans will continue to be convinced everything is going to be  fine, right up until that first handful of dirt hits the coffin lid. In  this case, people don't panic until the town hall shakes, buildings fall  down and the top of their mountain takes a short tour through the  stratosphere. &quot;It's too late people&quot;, I felt like shouting. The  bridge is out, the air is clogged with ash and the heated snow is causing a  flash flood. There is also the acid lake, falling rocks and quick flowing  lava for the townspeople to worry about  while trying to outrun the main  threat; A Pyroclastic cloud, travelling hundreds of miles an hour, which  will scramble anyone's eggs, no matter how fast they can run.But  not to worry, Harry has a four-wheel drive and a good reason to impress  Rachel, so you just know everything is going to work out. It's true that  there are a few less than believable moments during the film but compared  to &quot;Volcano&quot;, Dante's Peak is straight out of the encyclopedia  Britannica. For those that are curious, all of the volcanic activity  featured in the film is realistic. But you would never see it all happen in  the one eruption.

Of course, it never occurred to me to think of the film Dante's Peak for educational entertainment, and now, I can say that I am happy that I didn't. Although there is a lot of consistencies of volcano facts in Dante's Peak, the movie reaches the point midway where it gives up and begins to spout a lot of misconceptions. Shame on Roger Donaldson, given the fact, during the production notes, that he had seriously thought of becoming a volcanologist before abandoning it for a career in movies. Dante's Peak showcases a multitude of impossible physics including using a shirt to arm-paddle in a highly acidic water without a burn mark afterwards, outdriving (with no tires) a pyroclastic flow (it goes up to 450 miles per hour), safely ramming into a boarded-up mine shaft, driving over a lava stream without testing it and surviving it (the temperature of the lava stream is like 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit, enough to melt steel), seeing lights everywhere after the volcano eruption, evacuating a town within minutes, and getting everybody out of the mine shaft with them all looking good, healthy, and virile and sporting very white teeth. I guess nobody peed or crapped in their pants while waiting for the rescuers. I like the part where the truck gets towed like that, and nobody takes in the consideration that the rocks underneath will eventually collapse. On the other hand, the romantic relationship between the two lead characters is completely unnecessary and detracts from the film as a whole. Moreover, I don't think it's really critical to save the kids when their writing is obviously on the wall after reaching a point of no return. Nevertheless, I have positive feelings for Dante's Peak because I think it was actually entertaining and thrilling at times. And it's extremely amusing that they talk about Dante's Peak while making a comparison to Mount St. Helens when it's Mount St. Helens they are looking at! My favorite, and the most ridiculous, part of the film occurs in the beginning when a man is spotted carrying a heavy wooden cross as if he is Jesus Christ. All in all, while it's hard to ignore the factual errors, the hokey Dante's Peak is not a bad disaster film.",3,"An Entertaining, If Very Dumb, Picture.",1389398400,"01 11, 2014",2014,2318,"['Viewed', '1/14Rate', '61/14', 'was', 'middle', 'school', 'science', 'teacher', 'had', 'taught', 'volcano', 'two', 'weeks', 'students', 'course', 'never', 'occurred', 'think', 'film', 'Dante', 'Peak', 'educational', 'entertainment', 'now', 'can', 'say', 'am', 'happy', 'did', ""n't"", 'lot', 'consistencies', 'volcano', 'facts', 'Dante', 'Peak', 'movie', 'point', 'midway', 'where', 'up', 'spout', 'lot', 'misconceptions', 'Shame', 'Roger', 'Donaldson', 'given', 'fact', 'production', 'notes', 'had', 'seriously', 'thought', 'becoming', 'volcanologist', 'abandoning', 'career', 'movies', 'Dante', 'Peak', 'multitude', 'impossible', 'physics', 'including', 'using', 'shirt', 'arm-paddle', 'highly', 'acidic', 'water', 'burn', 'mark', 'afterwards', 'outdriving', 'tires', 'pyroclastic', 'flow', 'up', '450', 'miles', 'hour', 'safely', 'ramming', 'boarded-up', 'mine', 'shaft', 'driving', 'over', 'lava', 'stream', 'testing', 'surviving', 'temperature', 'lava', 'stream', '2,000', 'degrees', 'Fahrenheit', 'enough', 'melt', 'steel', 'seeing', 'lights', 'everywhere', 'volcano', 'eruption', 'evacuating', 'town', 'minutes', 'getting', 'everybody', 'mine', 'shaft', 'looking', 'good', 'healthy', 'virile', 'sporting', 'very', 'white', 'teeth', 'guess', 'nobody', 'peed', 'crapped', 'pants', 'waiting', 'rescuers', 'part', 'where', 'truck', 'towed', 'nobody', 'consideration', 'rocks', 'underneath', 'will', 'eventually', 'collapse', 'other', 'hand', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'two', 'lead', 'characters', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'detracts', 'film', 'whole', 'Moreover', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'really', 'critical', 'save', 'kids', 'when', 'writing', 'obviously', 'wall', 'reaching', 'point', 'return', 'Nevertheless', 'have', 'positive', 'feelings', 'Dante', 'Peak', 'think', 'was', 'actually', 'entertaining', 'thrilling', 'times', 'extremely', 'amusing', 'talk', 'Dante', 'Peak', 'making', 'comparison', 'Mount', 'St.', 'when', 'Mount', 'St.', 'Helens', 'are', 'looking', 'My', 'favorite', 'most', 'ridiculous', 'part', 'film', 'beginning', 'when', 'man', 'spotted', 'carrying', 'heavy', 'wooden', 'cross', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'hard', 'ignore', 'factual', 'errors', 'hokey', 'Dante', 'Peak', 'not', 'bad', 'disaster', 'film']",N/A

I might be a little biased because this movie was filmed about 45 miles or so away from where I live. I guess I have a case of favoritism going on here. Pierce Brosnan(Bond, James Bond)stars as a volcano expert named Harry Dalton from the U.S. Geological Survey who is taken to the small, quaint, picturesque town of Dante's Peak, when there is evidence of an active volcano. He meets Rachel Wando, the town's mayor(played by Linda Hamilton)and alerts her that her town is in danger. Not everyone, including some of Harry's co-workers, think there is imminent danger. Oh they would be wrong. So wrong. Before you can say 'Mt. St. Helens', the volcano erupts and the town is in it's warpath. Ash flies everywhere, lava destroying everything in it's path, steaming lakes, mudslides, flooding. You name it. This is a disaster film and they throw in plenty of disaster. The effects in this movie are really awesome. If anything, there's that. It's very realistic and pulled off very nicely. Trees and buildings being incinerated look really good. For me, the best sequence in the film is when Pierce, Linda, her kids, and Grandma are traveling across the steaming lake in the little boat and the boat is slowly being eaten away. Great suspense in this intense and nerve racking scene. Pierce Brosnan is a charming presence, and is pretty believeable in his role as a volcano expert. Linda Hamilton doesn't whip out the finely tuned muscles she had in ""Terminator 2"", but she holds her own. Nicely cast as a mother and mayor of a small town. Charles Hallahan, who will best be remembered as the captain in the ""Hunter"" TV series also stars. I got the chance to drive over to this town and saw some stuff being filmed. I caught a brief glimpse of Linda Hamilton, but nothing great. I saw Pierce's chair. I was there to see the filming of the town racing out of the school as the volcano erupted and the church steeple crumbled over and smashed into the school bus. It was a great sight to behold. This was in Wallace, Idaho. This isn't a monumental film that most people will probably remember afterwards. It's pure Hollywood entertainment in every way. It's fun, exciting, and it is very entertaining.

Both of them are really excellent disaster flicks and are enough to really make you `think' but even then they deliver incredible amounts of entertainment. In all honesty though, ""Dante's Peak"" is more realistic and has a more compelling twist to it due to the volcano's more destructive power.In this case, a small town is thriving in the mountains of Washington state and has recently been declared one of the best places to live in in the United States. Dr. Harry Dalton, a scientist is sent to the vicinity to survey unusually high geological activity but one day he makes an alarming discovery that the volcano that the town sits on the base of, has come back to life and geological surveys have cofirmed that Dante's Peak is about to erupt in a cataclysmic eruption and wipe out the town and it's people. Rachel Wando, the town's mayor along with Dalton now must try to evacuate the town before the volcano erupts but their safety is stifled by their economic interests.This is a really excellent and highly compelling movie. The special effects are absolutely thrilling and highly realistic and the movie's plot and script are very good. The lava and plumes of ash and dust are highly realistic looking and scary to watch as the volcano starts spewing out it's contents into the atmosphere and surrounding vicinity. The characters are excellent even though the acting could've been a little better but the acting for the most part is excellent by almost if not the entire cast.I was thrilled to see this on the big screen because I have had a longtime fascination with volcanoes for almost my entire life and ""Dante's Peak"" succeeds in delivering a thrilling tone and is very enjoyable for most of its length.  The DTS edition is absolutely incredible because the sound quality is a gargantuan improvement on both the VHS and older DVD editions and if you have a stereo system with speakers all around you, then hook them up and the surround audio speakers will make you feel almost like you're back at the movie theatre with the awesome sound quality.If you can, get this movie whenever possible because it is a really excellent natural disaster thriller and delivers far more scares than these so called `horror' movies because most of them are just mindless gorefests that are more gross than scary but ""Dante's Peak"" is scary because it is so realistic and such things could happen and could turn out much worse. For example Mt. Rainier near Seattle could erupt at any time and cause a lot of damage nearby and Seattle may be choked with dust if a full blown eruption occurs even though the city and most of its suburbs would pull through relatively unscathed apart from having a snow of volcanic ashes but it could cause social instability. Even Mt. St. Helen's caused a great deal of destruction and wiped out a large amount of forests around it. ""Dante's Peak"" is an excellent movie that should not be passed up.

Harry makes it but Marianne is killed. Then Harry is sent by his boss Dr Paul Dreyfus (Charles Hallahan) on a routine visit to a dormant volcano near the town of Dante's Peak. Once there Harry detects some disturbing signs that the volcano may no longer be dormant and just might be waking up. Harry warns the town's mayor, Rachel Wando (Linda Hamilton) that the town should be put on evacuation alert, but his boss overrules him. On a visit to a local hot spring pool, Harry and Rachel, accompanied by Rachel's two children, discover the bodies of two swimmers who were boiled to death by an eruption into the pool. Now Paul and the team arrive to investigate further. Although Paul is sceptical at first, the discovery that the town's water supply has become contaminated provokes him into action. The children's grandmother lives in a house precariously perched on a hillside not far from the volcano, and Harry and Rachel try unsuccessfully to get her to leave. When the volcano does erupt, the filming of the panic in the streets as people try to leave, and of the eruption and accompanying earthquake shocks is very realistic.

49602,A319SKSB556033,0783222475,"Inspector Gadget ""Go Go Gadget Reviews""","[46, 52]","The 'old-fashioned' disaster movie scenario enjoyed a brief resurgence in the latter half of the 90s. After the success of Twister and ID4, films like Hard Rain, Titanic, Armageddon and Deep Impact followed in its wake. Like the two competing asteroid movies, Dante's Peak was in competition with the imaginatively named Volcano as THE Lava flow of 1997. Which one is better? Well, comparing the two is like comparing an atomic blast to a popping pimple.Pierce Brosnan is Harry Dalton, a Vulcanologist (or James Bond in disguise if you want) who predicts a major eruption in the quaint Pacific-Northwestern town of Dante's Peak. No one wants to listen to him since the town has just been named the 2nd most desirable place to live in America and is in the early stages of a thriving economy. It's the politics from Jaws all over again. Despite being shouted down by his superiors, Harry sticks around to keep his eye on the imposing mountain and woo Mayor Wando (Linda Hamilton), who is the only one who believes the 4000-year dormant volcano might blow its top.If you've seen one disaster movie, you've seen 'em all in terms of character importance. Yes, it's bloody obvious who is going to die, some of these people might as well have a death clock counting down stuck on their foreheads. And the panicking idiot mobs don't deserve anything less firey. When will nameless extras learn that following the crowd isn't the best way? I guess this is the weakest part of Dante's Peak, it never really distances itself from that single, eternal clich&eacute; of disaster films.But the film is really nothing but a showcase for special effects and it does them surprisingly well. Made before the extreme popularity of CGI, Dante's Peak has a lot of real-life destruction, in-camera effects and stunt-work. Yes, there is a fair bit of CGI and for a 10-year-old film they still hold up really well. All Volano (Zzzz...) had to offer was a very, very slight lava flow and an unintentionally hilarious scene with a melting man but with Dante's Peak we get earthquakes, boiled skinny dippers, lakes of acid, ash blizzards that create a unique atmosphere, thunder and lightning, red hot boulders raining down from the sky, mudslides, lava (of course), a massive pyroclastic cloud and lots of deep, deep bass sound effects.It's not a life-changing film by any means, but as disaster movies go it's one of the best, has an occasionally spooky score and entertains really well despite Brosnan taking it all so seriously. I would have given it a higher rating if they killed the dog (more original) and deleted the annoying Grant Heslov's utterly pointless character.The Blu Ray presents the film is gorgeous 1080p 2.35:1 with a brilliant DTS HD-MA sound design.

The film appears to be loosely based on the actual eruption of Mount St Helens in 1980. The setting and mountain scenery are magnificent. Dante's Peak was released just before another disaster film called Volcano but Dante's Peak is superior to Volcano in every way. The cast in Dante's Peak is very appealing, especially the lovely Linda Hamilton as the mayor of Dante's Peak. However, the ladies will probably find the suave Pierce Brosnan more appealing in the role of expert vulcanologist and life saver. The special effects are awesome, and the dangers faced by Pierce Brosnan, Linda Hamilton, and her very attractive children are produced with frightening realism.

49606,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,0783222475,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[1, 2]","Pierce Brosnan and Linda Hamilton star in this explosive movie about the town of Dante's Peak, where a long-dormant volcano is about to erupt with devastating force.Brosnan stars as Harry Dalton.  He works for the U.S. Geological Survey office studying volcanoes.  He's notified of seismic activity occuring near Dante's Peak and he's sent to investigate.  Hamilton stars as Rachel Wando, the mayor of Dante's Peak.  Dante's Peak has recently been named as the second most desireable place to live in the United States with a population less than 20,000.Soon, Harry and Rachel meet, and she shows him around the town.  Next, they drive up to the mountain so Harry can do some tests to determine if there's a chance of an eruption.  Two burnt bodies are discovered in a spring on the mountain.  Meanwhile, Harry reports to his boss that the whole area should be monitored.  Carbon dioxide in the soil is killing plants and animals, and the water has turned acidic.  Rachel calls a city council meeting, and Harry recommends evacuating the area, much to the displeasure of the council.  A new industry is locating to Dante's Peak, and the council fears that they will pull out due to the concern surrounding the volcano.Paul Dreyfus, Harry's Boss, played by Charles Hallahan, arrives in the town and he feels an alert is not needed.  The crew stays to monitor the condition of the mountain and to run more tests.  Harry still believes that the volcano is dangerous.Readings are taken at the mountain, and all levels appear normal.  No eruption is expected to happen.  Meanwhile, Harry and Rachel have grown closer to each other.A special type pf machine is lowered down into the volcano to take more precise readings.  The machine malfunctions, and Terry, one of the scientists, goes down to investigate.  Just at that moment, an earthquake strikes and destroys the machine.  Terry is trapped under the rubble with a broken leg.  A helicopter is flown in to rescue Terry and Harry.  Once on the ground, Harry and Paul have another confrontation.  Harry still believes that the volcano is going to erupt.  Paul believes that there's still nothing to worry about and informs Harry that the crew that they're pulling out.Harry and Rachel get set to spend a last night together when Harry discovers that the water contains sulfur dioxide after Rachel's tap water is found to be contaminated.  He is able to convince Paul that something is definitely wrong.  The town is then put on alert and evacuation plans are made.  Ruth, Rachel's mother in law, lives on the mountain, but she refuses to evacuate her home.  As soon as an informational town meeting has been called, the volcano begins to erupt.  Chaos and panic occur as people try to get to safety.Harry and Rachel leave to rescue Rachel's children.  However, the children have taken Rachel's truck to rescue their grandmother.  After some near misses from trees and rocks, Harry and Rachel manage to get to Ruth's home and rescue the children.  They all manage to escape in the nick of time as molten lava engulfs the house.  Their only hope of escape is to take a motorboat across the lake, but the volcanic activity has turned the water to acid, and its eating the metal of the boat away.  Soon, the motor's prop is gone, stalling the boat.  Ruth leaps into the acid water and pulls the boat to safety.  Despite saving the children, Rachel, and Harry, Ruth's legs are badly burned from the acid, and she dies on her mountain.The National Guard arrives, and everyone in the town is evacuated to safety, but Paul is still there.  There's only one bridge left standing over the river.  The National Guard vehicles make it, but Paul is less fortunate.  Rachel, Harry, and the children manage to get off the mountain in a hot-wired pickup truck.The volcano finally erupts in all its fury, and trees and houses are destroyed as though they were toys.  Now trapped underground, will Harry, Rachel, and the children survive, or is it too late?I found this to be an exciting movie.  The special effects are very good, especially the eruptions and the subsequent ash cloud which levels the trees and houses.  The acting is good and the story keeps you on edge throughout the movie.

49615,A3GKPMHV4U64IY,0783222475,Joshua Koppel,"[0, 3]","Ever since seeing the preview, I have wanted to see Dante's Peak.  While waiting for it to be released, a second film called Volcano suddenly popped up.  Dante's Peak had Pierce Brosnan (playing a character named Dalton) and Volcano had Tommy Lee Jones.  Peak also had the creative talents of Michael Crichton.  Volcano had none.  But, having finally seen Dante's Peak I have to say that Volcano was the better movie.Brosnan is part of a national team that keeps an eye on volcanic activity.  He is sent to the town of Dante's Peak to see if there is reason for further testing.  He goes, he looks and he becomes convinced that the sleeping volcano will blow sometime soon.  Unfortunately he has no real evidence.  The rest of the team arrives and they can find no justifiable evidence.  Guess what?  Brosnan is right and the volcano blows.  There is a rather amusing scene where in order to survive the shockwave, Brosnan and the town's mayor must seek shelter in some unstable mines (an idea that only works when the alternative is certain death).  In the end there is no town but almost no casualties thanks to Brosnan and the rest of the team.The scenes with the volcano erupting were quite spectacular but they were not enough to carry the film.  It is an almost intellectual endeavor as opposed to the pulse-pounding of Crichton's previous film Twister.  Obviously meant to ride the wave of Twister's success, Dante's Peak fails to make the grade.  In Twister we cared about the research team and their work.

I think because you feel the struggle to survive throughout the film and there is always HOPE, then, in the end, you feel the rush of good feelings when the hero(s) survive these tremendous odds and ""win"".This movie has outstanding visual effects and it builds nicely in intensity.  It reminds you generally of the Mt Saint Helens story.  The storyline involves a volcano that is up in the middle of God's country and erupts in this peaceful, unprepared and unbelieving town.  There's enough added info about seismic detection equipment, pyroclastic blasts, sulphur in the water, etc. that makes you feel like you might be a little smarter after watching the movie.  There is the usual introduction of characters, as typical of a disaster movie, before the xxxx hits the fan.  That way you get to know a little bit about their history and personality.  Once it hits the fan, there is non-stop action.There is also a great mix of personality diversity in the movie, which definitely adds to its flavor.  People like the older grandmother who doesn't want to leave the mountain when its about to blow, to the greedy helicopter pilot, to the overly cautious boss, to the extra cautious volcanologist, and all the people panicking.  There are even 2 kids and a dog, and a lady mayor who runs a coffee shop on the side.  Realistic?  Well, we KNOW that NO ONE would be greedy and capitalize on someone else's misfortune, so maybe the greedy helicopter pilot is a little extreme? :-)  Of course, the hero perseveres through all kinds of unbelievable turmoil.  He just keeps on going.Seriously, the diverse personalities help to add contrast and realism. They keep you on the edge, cheering the good guys, boo-ing the bad guys, and thinking things like ""Hey, whattsamattah wit you!  Can't you see the mountain is gonna blow!  Get outtah there!--Oh, you dummy!""If you like disaster movies, this is a good 'un.",5,Thar She Blows!,1164758400,"11 29, 2006",2006,1959,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'DVD', 'like', 'disaster', 'films', 'anyway', 'think', 'feel', 'struggle', 'survive', 'film', 'always', 'HOPE', 'then', 'end', 'feel', 'rush', 'good', 'feelings', 'when', 'hero', 'survive', 'tremendous', 'odds', 'win', '.This', 'movie', 'outstanding', 'visual', 'effects', 'nicely', 'intensity', 'generally', 'Mt', 'Saint', 'Helens', 'story', 'storyline', 'volcano', 'up', 'middle', 'God', 'country', 'erupts', 'peaceful', 'unprepared', 'unbelieving', 'town', 'enough', 'added', 'info', 'seismic', 'detection', 'equipment', 'pyroclastic', 'blasts', 'sulphur', 'water', 'etc', 'feel', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'smarter', 'watching', 'movie', 'usual', 'introduction', 'characters', 'typical', 'disaster', 'movie', 'xxxx', 'fan', 'way', 'get', 'know', 'little', 'bit', 'history', 'personality', 'fan', 'non-stop', 'action.There', 'also', 'great', 'mix', 'personality', 'diversity', 'movie', 'definitely', 'flavor', 'People', 'older', 'grandmother', 'who', ""n't"", 'want', 'leave', 'mountain', 'when', 'blow', 'greedy', 'helicopter', 'pilot', 'overly', 'cautious', 'boss', 'extra', 'cautious', 'volcanologist', 'people', 'panicking', 'are', 'even', '2', 'kids', 'dog', 'lady', 'mayor', 'who', 'coffee', 'shop', 'side', 'Realistic', 'Well', 'KNOW', 'NO', 'ONE', 'would', 'be', 'greedy', 'capitalize', 'someone', 'else', 'misfortune', 'so', 'maybe', 'greedy', 'helicopter', 'pilot', 'little', 'extreme', 'course', 'hero', 'kinds', 'unbelievable', 'turmoil', 'just', 'keeps', 'going.Seriously', 'diverse', 'personalities', 'help', 'add', 'contrast', 'realism', 'keep', 'edge', 'cheering', 'good', 'guys', 'boo-ing', 'bad', 'guys', 'thinking', 'things', 'Hey', 'whattsamattah', 'wit', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'mountain', 'gon', 'blow', 'Get', 'there', 'Oh', 'dummy', 'like', 'disaster', 'movies', 'good', ""'un""]",N/A

Let's make friends with the ebola carrying monkeys, with the raptors, with the great white sharks, with the blood thirsty natives. Doesn't matter.But it plays into the ""greedy businessman"" genre that's so common in disaster flicks. It's like Mayor Murray Hamilton in Jaws, ""let's let the kids play in the water with the 18 foot white because we need the concession business.""So it's really expected that the townspeople will get upset with Pierce Brosnan when he tells them, ""bad news, life as you know it is going to change real soon.""

A small but sweet romantic spark seems to start between the two, but there is no time for love when the trouble begins.Earth shaking scenes of carnage and lava flows devouring everything in their path suddenly put everyone in peril, and the scenes of escape and also of being trapped do add some suspenseful feelings as the second half of this film really rocks with scene after scene of the action, and the impending after effect of the lava.

I don't have a clue, sylvester stalloyn or something, I don't know who it was. I honestly liked this movie though. Don't think it tried too hard to be the smash hit of all time, but was good. Linda Hamiliton was in my favorite movie of all time, T2. Pierce Brosdon or whatever was in Golden-eye which was alright. I feel his later bonds are quite boring compared to Golden-eye or whatever, but hes cool in this. The lava is crazy cool, a bit boring at times when we think there is nothing wrong, then there is an explosion and the whole place is burnt to the ground. I loved the smoke from the volcano when you first see it. And the big smoke cloud chasing them looks cool from far away.I enjoyed the movie though. Good to just not think about anything except escaping that lava. Relaxing, action movie.

So this was popped into the DVD player, and settled back expecting another standard nature going nuts movie. (There's too many of those.)About halfway through, I suddenly remembered, that Edinburgh Castle (near to where I live) was built on a seemingly dormant (extinct?) volcano. Also, the volcano in Pompeii was supposed to be dormant, as was the volcano in this. Scary stuff. I don't think I'll be visiting Edinburgh Castle anytime soon.Dante's Peak starts with a bang, and keeps up the standard right through the movie. There's little time to catch your breath, as shocker after shocker hits you smack bang in the face. It's very much a rollercoaster ride. The special effects are excellent, and the characters have good stories - even if the 'relationship' between Rachel (Linda Hamilton) & Harry (Pierce) does seem a little bit contrived and happens a bit too fast.Some of the special effect shots are excellent, but the one that sticks out in my mind was the ones showing the reflection of the volcano errupting in a car window, with Rachel looking back. Wow. It was a subtle but brilliant shot.There's not a lot to say about Dante's Peak, without ruining exactly what happens during the movie. It is up there in my opinion, with the great action disaster movies of the nineties, and is absolutely perfect in high definition. Can't fault it not even slightly. Pierce, although not one of my favourite actors, does the action hero role reasonably well, and Linda, with a very bad haircut, doesn't just do the usual damsel in distress role. You go girl!

This was one of my first disaster films, other than Earthquake. I've owned it on VHS, and DVD...twice! Obviously it is one of my favorites. Even with the so-called cliches, which rarely ruin a movie for me, anyway) this film never gets old. Director Roger Donaldson, who also made Species-didn't care much for that) clearly did his homework, and overall, knows the material. Pierce Brosnan as Dr. Harry Dalton does a very nice job as the volcanologist, who just won't back down from his prediction, no matter what any one tells him, including his boss, played by Charles Hallahan-essentially a character actor. The rest of the team does a decent job as well, even throwing in some humor periodically. Linda Hamilton as the town's mayor, best known as Sarah Conner from the first two Terminator films, was very good and likable in this, along with her two children. Theme composer James Newton Howard-just like the current Dark Knight series and Devil's Advocate, does a very creepy and ominously effective score. The characters are well cast, but for some, the real star is the volcano-when it finally does erupt, and boy! Does it ever!) The devastation looks fairly realistic.

Pierce Brosnan (the new James Bond), stars as Harry Dalton, a geologist (an expert on volcanos) who comes to this beautiful town in Washington state that's highly populated to research a volcano next to the town which is said to be extinct, but Harry discovers that this volcano is still active, and it's only a matter of short time when this volcano will erupt. Harry tries to get the town's attention, but hardly anybody believes him except for the town's mayor, Rachel Wando (Linda Hamilton), until it is too late. Now, Harry does whatever he can to save Rachel (whom he's secretly falling in love with), her two young children, and the children's grandmother and get them out of the town and far away from the volcano. Harry desparately tries to get Rachel and her family to safety because several years ago, his wife died while they were trying to escape another erupting volcano and doesn't want the same thing happening to Rachel.Yes, this is a natural disaster movie and some of it is politically incorrect, but it is still a fun movie to watch. The performances are especially excellent, especially by Pierce Brosnan, Linda Hamilton, and the two children. The visual and sound effects are truly superb and a thrill ride! There is a good storyline to it, as well. DANTE'S PEAK will keep you on the edge of your seat.This collector's edition DVD is awesome!

49690,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,0783222475,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[7, 8]","""Dante's Peak"" is one of the disaster movies that really brings the genre to a super peak, with a realistic and thrilling earth-shaking (in this case literally) catastrophe, high octane action, glorious cinematography capturing great natural beauty, and high-quality characters and relationships.  It is, of course, about a volcano, one of the most powerful forces in nature, and it successfully captures the grandeur and terror of such an event.  I've always found volcanoes fascinating - they're terrifically destructive, and of course tragic for the havoc they wreak, both when they're near human habitation and when they're in the 'isolated' wilderness where the other creatures are the sole recipients of their explosive force.  And yet they're undeniably beautiful, like a sunset or a howling snowstorm, and they're in fact an essential part of the inner workings of the earth.  Also, although there is often a lot of death associated with volcanoes as acre after acre gets burnt up or covered with ash, they're also, paradoxically, major bringers of life.  Even extremely barren, infertile lands with usually burst forth with new life within a few years of a volcano, because they bring forth such rich new nutrients in their lava.""Dante's Peak"" is smart by not having the disaster hit five minutes after the opening credits have finished rolling; there have been some movies of this nature over the years that have made just that mistake.  This one though is perfectly paced throughout.  There is plently of tight build-up and a couple of tragic harbingers of the bigger calamity to come.  The action in the latter parts of the movie is explosive and exhilirating, among the best.  It's interesting that ""Dante's Peak"" has managed to position itself as one of the greatest action movies without any real bad guys.  There are some unlikable characters - short-sighted, arrogant, condescending - but that's all.  They're jerks, but they're not characters who are going to go out and kill somebody.  So in this tremendous action movie there's no one shooting at each other, no swordplay, no high-impact kick battles.  Don't get me wrong - I love the kind of movies represented by ""Lethal Weapon"", ""Timebomb"", ""True Lies"", ""Out Of Time"", all that; and I generally even more love the more fantastical, really grand movies like ""Superman Returns"", ""Star Wars"", ""Lord Of The Rings"", ""Spider-Man"", all that stuff.  But it's neat that a movie missing so many of the great staples of action fare has also brought itself up into the cream of the crop.The visuals of ""Dante's Peak"" are awesome.  The volcanic effects are extremely realistic, and just the natural splendor is great.  As mentioned, the cinematography is incredible, although there is admittedly one wonderful shot that was promising to be truly spectacular but gets hampered a bit by the camera being in the wrong angle to capture it all.  A very minor quibble.  It would also be an extremely minor quibble if one was to spend too much time focusing on the improbably high number of razor-thin escapes by some of the characters.  Movie makers Are allowed some artistic licences even in realistic scenarios after all, and besides, in a case where two outcomes are possible but one quite a bit more likely, you don't have to go with the most likely one Every time.  You shouldn't also go with the most unlikely every time either or it loses its believability and tension, and ""Dante's Peak"" doesn't do that.  It stays on just the right tip of the balancing scale.Excellent stuff; for more disaster-oriented greats I also recommend ""Deep Impact"" and ""Titanic"".",5,Catastrophe-Action Done Right; A Whopping Great Thrill Ride With Feeling,1168387200,"01 10, 2007",2007,3618,"['Dante', 'Peak', 'one', 'disaster', 'movies', 'really', 'genre', 'super', 'peak', 'realistic', 'thrilling', 'earth-shaking', 'case', 'literally', 'catastrophe', 'high', 'octane', 'action', 'glorious', 'cinematography', 'capturing', 'great', 'natural', 'beauty', 'high-quality', 'characters', 'relationships', 'course', 'volcano', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'forces', 'nature', 'successfully', 'grandeur', 'terror', 'such', 'event', ""'ve"", 'always', 'found', 'volcanoes', 'fascinating', ""'re"", 'terrifically', 'destructive', 'course', 'tragic', 'havoc', 'wreak', 'when', ""'re"", 'human', 'habitation', 'when', ""'re"", ""'isolated"", 'wilderness', 'where', 'other', 'creatures', 'are', 'sole', 'recipients', 'explosive', 'force', 'yet', ""'re"", 'undeniably', 'beautiful', 'sunset', 'howling', 'snowstorm', ""'re"", 'fact', 'essential', 'part', 'inner', 'workings', 'earth', 'Also', 'often', 'lot', 'death', 'associated', 'volcanoes', 'acre', 'acre', 'burnt', 'up', 'covered', 'ash', ""'re"", 'also', 'paradoxically', 'major', 'bringers', 'life', 'Even', 'extremely', 'barren', 'infertile', 'lands', 'usually', 'burst', 'forth', 'new', 'life', 'few', 'years', 'volcano', 'bring', 'forth', 'such', 'rich', 'new', 'nutrients', 'lava', 'Dante', 'Peak', 'smart', 'not', 'having', 'disaster', 'hit', 'five', 'minutes', 'opening', 'credits', 'have', 'finished', 'rolling', 'have', 'been', 'movies', 'nature', 'years', 'have', 'made', 'just', 'mistake', 'one', 'though', 'perfectly', 'paced', 'plently', 'tight', 'build-up', 'couple', 'tragic', 'harbingers', 'bigger', 'calamity', 'come', 'action', 'latter', 'parts', 'movie', 'explosive', 'exhilirating', 'best', 'interesting', 'Dante', 'Peak', 'managed', 'position', 'one', 'greatest', 'action', 'movies', 'real', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'unlikable', 'characters', 'short-sighted', 'arrogant', 'condescending', ""'re"", 'jerks', ""'re"", 'not', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'going', 'go', 'out', 'kill', 'somebody', 'So', 'tremendous', 'action', 'movie', 'one', 'shooting', 'other', 'swordplay', 'high-impact', 'kick', 'battles', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'love', 'kind', 'movies', 'represented', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', 'Timebomb', 'True', 'Lies', 'Time', 'generally', 'even', 'more', 'love', 'more', 'fantastical', 'really', 'grand', 'movies', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Spider-Man', 'stuff', 'neat', 'movie', 'missing', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'staples', 'action', 'fare', 'also', 'brought', 'up', 'cream', 'crop.The', 'visuals', 'Dante', 'Peak', 'are', 'awesome', 'volcanic', 'effects', 'are', 'extremely', 'realistic', 'just', 'natural', 'splendor', 'great', 'mentioned', 'cinematography', 'incredible', 'admittedly', 'one', 'wonderful', 'shot', 'was', 'promising', 'be', 'truly', 'spectacular', 'hampered', 'bit', 'camera', 'being', 'wrong', 'angle', 'capture', 'very', 'minor', 'quibble', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'extremely', 'minor', 'quibble', 'one', 'was', 'spend', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'focusing', 'improbably', 'high', 'number', 'razor-thin', 'escapes', 'characters', 'Movie', 'makers', 'Are', 'allowed', 'artistic', 'licences', 'even', 'realistic', 'scenarios', 'besides', 'case', 'where', 'two', 'outcomes', 'are', 'possible', 'one', 'quite', 'bit', 'more', 'likely', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'go', 'most', 'likely', 'one', 'time', 'should', ""n't"", 'also', 'go', 'most', 'unlikely', 'time', 'believability', 'tension', 'Dante', 'Peak', ""n't"", 'do', 'just', 'right', 'tip', 'balancing', 'scale.Excellent', 'stuff', 'more', 'disaster-oriented', 'greats', 'also', 'recommend', 'Deep', 'Impact', 'Titanic']",N/A

Hope it fits  your needs.I picked this one up at the local big box store for $6.00 to limit the risk regarding this popcorn movie.  It was a risk well taken.The video has far more pluses than minus'.  The colors are, for the most part, bright and well contrasted.  I am sure they popped the colors a touch in post production.  No artifacts that I could see, however, and especially early on, I did notice a bit of motion blur in the first chapter of the film that was to have been a volcanic eruption in a Columbian town.  That did seem to settle down and I really can't say that I noticed it further into the movie.  The Mbps rate seemed to average in the high teens to low 20s which means that they really didn't do any real remastering.  There is a function where, if you missed some of the dialogue, you hit the remote's yellow button.  I did at one point and a subtitle of the dialogue came up but would not go away.  It actually crashed the Blu Ray player.  This is the first time I have ever seen that or had that happen.  I will stay away from that function for the future.  I repowered the Blu Ray player and all was well from then on.  Overall, the video transfer rates a 4 from me.The audio will also be a 4 or 4.5.  It was a lossless DTS MA 5.1  The dialogue was clear and easy to hear and understand....in most places.  There were a couple of scenes where the soundtrack overpowered the dialogue and this brings down its rating from me.  However, there was some really fine tracking of foley effects and discreet directionality making use of the entire sound system, especially so during the final volcano eruption and all that ensued afterwoods.  Some excellent panning of audio between the front and rear stages as well as from left to right. For sure, your LFE sub channel will be put to great use.Extras included in this Universal disc include commentary, trailer and a few short docs on casting, the science of vulcanology, some interviews et al.  Lots of wasted disc space from Universal's Blu Ray gimmick interactive nonsense that I doubt many will use as well as previews/ads for other movies.  This could have been devoted to a higher mbps rate for a cleaner video transfer.And that's all she wrote folks.  Hope this review was helpful to you in deciding upon your purchase.

49692,AZCDCO6KK2T81,0783222475,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[4, 5]","I have to admit that I'm a huge fan of disaster flicks so my opinion here is very bias.  This is definitely better than the average disaster film in spite of stereotypes, cliche lines and plot, ""B"" grade actors (excluding Brosnan and Hamilton).  I don't think I need to cover the whole story here as Amazon has done that and so have a good number of reviewers here.  So I'll focus on the following:Acting:  All are believable, even in the stereotypical roles.  Brosnan is perfectly cast in this film and it's a nice departure from his Bond role as most of his performances are (considerMrs. DoubtfireandThe Matador).  Linda Hamilton of theThe Terminator)films is cast against type as she is normally assigned as a tough, no-nonsense, take the bull by the horns kind of character.  Here we see a softer side to her and she is very believable in this role of the single mother and mayor of a small town.Now Charles Hallahan is a real find in this movie.  He is a ""B"" movie actor who gives an ""A"" performance in this film.  You may remember him from countless other films as he is a great character actor, but he made history in John Carpenter's remake ofThe Thingin which he has that memorable scene of turning into the monster by having his head come off, sprouting legs, and walking away with his head upside down.  In this film he convincingly plays Brosnan's boss.  Of course, his dialogue helps to make him convincing as he does raise very legitimate concerns about Brosnan's holier than thou ""I can feel what's gonna happen without any evidence"" bit.  He is not the stereotypical doubting, conniving, out to destroy his best man out of jealousy kind of boss.  He professionally puts the lid on Brosnan panic-raising mannerisms and yet gives him every chance to prove his case that this volcano is going to erupt and when ALL evidence says it won't, he appropriately shuts things down just before the thing blows its lid.  It's Hallahan's best role and it was extremely well-written.Script: Cliche-ridden as it is, it is literate most of the time and ironically, as noted above, Brosnan's boss is the best written character in the story.  The rest are written in a believable enough manner, but there are serious lapses like Hamilton's thank you to Brosnan for saving her son by making him a dinner, and her ex-mother-in-law's ""This mountain is never gonna hurt me"" cliched nonsense.Direction: It is very well-paced and skillfully done.  ""Dante's Peak"" is a complex film considering the unique special effects and some directors are just not good at this kind of thing.  Try to imagine Oliver Stone directingThe Lord of the Ringsand you get what I'm saying.Special Effects:  Unique, totally believable, mind-boggling at times, entertaining, and the kind that will hold up over time like those in theStar Wars TrilogyandClose Encounters of the Third Kind.  They aren't overdone where they overwhelm the story and take the place of acting and script.  The effects in this story help to tell the story without overwhelming it.  Some good examples of films where the special effects were over-the-top and attempted to compensate for poor acting and/or scriptwriting would beSpawn(horror),The Swarm(sci-fi), andTidal Wave: No Escape(disaster flick).",4,Dante's Peak is Near the Peak of Disaster Films,1165363200,"12 6, 2006",2006,3247,"['have', 'admit', ""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'disaster', 'flicks', 'opinion', 'here', 'very', 'bias', 'definitely', 'better', 'average', 'disaster', 'film', 'spite', 'stereotypes', 'cliche', 'lines', 'plot', 'B', 'grade', 'actors', 'excluding', 'Brosnan', 'Hamilton', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'need', 'cover', 'whole', 'story', 'here', 'Amazon', 'done', 'so', 'have', 'good', 'number', 'reviewers', 'here', 'So', ""'ll"", 'focus', 'following', 'Acting', 'are', 'believable', 'even', 'stereotypical', 'roles', 'Brosnan', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'film', 'nice', 'departure', 'Bond', 'role', 'most', 'performances', 'are', 'considerMrs', 'DoubtfireandThe', 'Matador', 'Linda', 'Hamilton', 'theThe', 'Terminator', 'films', 'cast', 'type', 'normally', 'assigned', 'tough', 'no-nonsense', 'take', 'bull', 'horns', 'kind', 'character', 'Here', 'see', 'softer', 'side', 'very', 'believable', 'role', 'single', 'mother', 'mayor', 'small', 'town.Now', 'Charles', 'Hallahan', 'real', 'find', 'movie', 'B', 'movie', 'actor', 'who', 'A', 'performance', 'film', 'may', 'remember', 'countless', 'other', 'films', 'great', 'character', 'actor', 'made', 'history', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'remake', 'ofThe', 'Thingin', 'memorable', 'scene', 'turning', 'monster', 'having', 'head', 'come', 'off', 'sprouting', 'legs', 'walking', 'away', 'head', 'upside', 'down', 'film', 'convincingly', 'Brosnan', 'boss', 'course', 'dialogue', 'make', 'convincing', 'raise', 'very', 'legitimate', 'concerns', 'Brosnan', 'holier', 'can', 'feel', 'what', 'gon', 'happen', 'evidence', 'bit', 'not', 'stereotypical', 'doubting', 'conniving', 'destroy', 'best', 'man', 'jealousy', 'kind', 'boss', 'professionally', 'lid', 'Brosnan', 'panic-raising', 'mannerisms', 'yet', 'chance', 'prove', 'case', 'volcano', 'going', 'erupt', 'when', 'ALL', 'evidence', 'wo', ""n't"", 'appropriately', 'things', 'down', 'just', 'thing', 'lid', 'Hallahan', 'best', 'role', 'was', 'extremely', 'well-written.Script', 'Cliche-ridden', 'literate', 'most', 'time', 'ironically', 'noted', 'Brosnan', 'boss', 'best', 'written', 'character', 'story', 'rest', 'are', 'written', 'believable', 'enough', 'manner', 'are', 'serious', 'lapses', 'Hamilton', 'thank', 'Brosnan', 'saving', 'son', 'making', 'dinner', 'ex-mother-in-law', 'mountain', 'never', 'gon', 'hurt', 'cliched', 'nonsense.Direction', 'very', 'well-paced', 'skillfully', 'done', 'Dante', 'Peak', 'complex', 'film', 'considering', 'unique', 'special', 'effects', 'directors', 'are', 'just', 'not', 'good', 'kind', 'thing', 'Try', 'imagine', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'directingThe', 'Lord', 'Ringsand', 'get', 'what', ""'m"", 'saying.Special', 'Effects', 'Unique', 'totally', 'believable', 'mind-boggling', 'times', 'entertaining', 'kind', 'will', 'hold', 'up', 'time', 'theStar', 'Wars', 'TrilogyandClose', 'Encounters', 'Third', 'Kind', 'are', ""n't"", 'overdone', 'where', 'overwhelm', 'story', 'take', 'place', 'acting', 'script', 'effects', 'story', 'help', 'tell', 'story', 'overwhelming', 'good', 'examples', 'films', 'where', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'over-the-top', 'attempted', 'compensate', 'poor', 'acting', 'and/or', 'scriptwriting', 'would', 'beSpawn', 'horror', 'Swarm', 'sci-fi', 'andTidal', 'Wave', 'Escape', 'disaster', 'flick']",N/A

""Dante's Peak"" won that race by a nose with it's release date coming in February, and Volcano's coming in April. In the end it doesn't matter which film won the race as both are nothing more than a couple of tired old nags that belong in the glue factory.  In the 1970's, Hollywood gave us a satchel full of disaster films such as this, as most of those were usually filled with an underwhelming all star cast placed smack dab in the middle of some impending doom whether it was jetliners with holes poked in them, skyscrapers lit up like a blow torch, overturned ocean liners, or earthquakes rocking the California coast. In the 1990's, we were still getting the disaster films, but the all-star has been casts seem to have been done away with. Instead we get a few well known cast members sleep walking through an exercise in how to survive nature's peril. In ""Dante's Peak"" they throw Pierce Brosnan who is moonlighting from his ""007"" job along with ""Terminator"" cast off Linda Hamilton at us to gawk at. Brosnan should have just taken the time off and Hamilton should have looked for another gig.Resident volcano expert Harry Dalton (Brosnan) comes to the town of Dante's Peak to find out whether or not the local volcano is still dormant or is ready to pop it's cork. Harry, you see, was in love with another volcano expert he worked with who just loved to get up close and personal with them. Unfortunately for Harry, she gets bopped in the head during one such explosion and that's the end of her.  Linda Hamilton is the mayor of Dante's Peak. Unlike her character of Sarah Connor in the ""Terminator"" films, who took action when things weren't looking too good, as mayor and widow Rachel Wando she does nothing much more than run around the mountainside looking worried and fretting about her kids and her mother-in-law who lives on the mountain. The mother-in-law, Ruth, is played by Elizabeth Hoffman, and is supposed to be just like that guy who stuck around Mount St. Helens till the bitter end refusing to move from his home. Here it just enables the writers to throw in the idiotic plot development where the kids and Rachel have to go and rescue her just as Dante's Peak is spewing ash and lava all over the countryside. It's supposed to add suspense and excitement, but only serves to up the stupid level. For one thing, Ruth is annoying enough that we don't care whether she is rescued or not, and second, the two kids (Jamie Ren&eacute;e Smith and Jeremy Foley) have a high annoyance level of their own and we end up rooting for Dante's Peak instead of them.There are truly some ridiculous scenes in this film. These are the moments we would usually just overlook and go on if we were at least being entertained somewhat by the proceedings but since we are not, they stand out like the Rock of Gibraltar. We get people in a jeep riding a lava flow, Pierce Brosnan paddling a boat with his hand in an acid filled lake and not being any worse the wear for it, we get a couple of cute dog moments, we get a ridiculous scene of our cast trying to outrun a cloud of ash in a jeep and so forth and so on.  Also on hand is Charles Hallahan as Brosnan's doubting Thomas boss Paul Dreyfuss who is made to believe in the eruption only when it's too late to do anything about it.

49711,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,0783222475,Wuchak,"[0, 0]","1997 delivered two volcano movies, ""Dante's Peak"" and ""Volcano."" The latter film stars Tommy Lee Jones and takes place in Los Angeles. Volcanic activity in Los Angeles? They might as well have had the story take place in Ohio! Needless to say, the idea never tripped my trigger. ""Dante's Peak,"" however, has piqued my interest over the years. I've seen a couple clips of the film while channel surfing and each time I was drawn into the storyline. One clip I saw showed a skinny dipping couple in a hot spring suddenly get boiled to death because of the volcanic activity of the mountain. Another clip showed a handful of people trying to escape the volcano in a boat on a lake. The lake had become acidic because of the volcanic pangs of the mountain and all the fish were dead and the propeller on the boat melted away. These scenes convinced me that the film was worth catching some day.THE PLOT: A scenic Washington town at the foot of a mountain is celebrating being nominated one of America's best small towns. Meanwhile a scientist from the U.S. Geological Survey (Pierce Brosnan) sniffs around the massive peak and becomes convinced the Volcano is going to blow at any minute. The rest of the scientific team comes to town to investigate while Brosnan develops a relationship with the mayor (Linda Hamilton). Brosnan wants to put the town on immediate alert while the boss vulcanologist doesn't want to jump to conclusions and disrupt the town's economic interests. The volcano blows, of course.As you can see, the plot rips off ""Jaws,"" trading a Volcano for the shark, but it's effective. The thing about ""Dante's Peak"" is that IT'S BASED ON REAL-LIFE EVENTS. On May 18, 1980, Mt. St. Helens in Washington blew her top. Although there was no decent sized town nearby, 57 people were killed and 250 homes, 47 bridges, 185 miles of highway, 15 miles of railway and hundreds of miles of forestry were obliterated. The eruption caused a massive debris avalanche, reducing the elevation of the mountain's summit from 9,677 feet to 8,365 feet and replacing it with a mile-wide horseshoe-shaped crater. Mt. St. Helens is even mentioned in the picture a few times.WHAT WORKS: The cast is likable even though they do dumb things or react in a stupid fashion, e.g. the grandma who insists on staying on her mountain because it would never harm her (aduh). I always thought Brosnan was too dour as James Bond, but he's more likable and human here, albeit still serious. Anyway, I like the way the film takes its time to let us get to know the characters before disaster strikes. This works because, in the meantime, anticipation of the eruption slowly builds.I've read quite a few of the Amazon reviews and was surprised that no one had commented on the scenic locations. The town scenes were filmed in Wallace, Idaho. This quaint village sits at the foot of a big hill (we'd call it a mountain in the East), which was digitally enhanced to appear as a volcano in the film. I tell you what, they fooled me 'cause it sure looks like a real volcano. Anyway, the shots on the mountain and in the crater were filmed at none other than Mt. St. Helens, Washington (my brother incidentally lives a mere 50 miles north of there in Yelm but has mysteriously never climbed the volcano -- WIMP!).The F/X are outstanding. They used both miniatures and CGI. The volcano doesn't fully erupt until the last half hour of the film's 1 hour and 50 minutes runtime.WHAT DOESN'T WORK: Some of the dialogue and acting is lame here and there and I find the idea of a truck driving through lava to be unbelievable -- it sure took a long time for the tires to blow -- but, then again, I don't really know how long thick truck tires would last under those conditions. Lastly, they could've done better with the women (e.g. the hot spring girl, etc.), although Linda's always likable.BOTTOM LINE: Want to see what it might have been like to be near Mt. St. Helens when she blew her top? ""Dante's Peak"" is the next best thing to being there. It's one of the better disaster flicks.GRADE: B+",4,What was it like to be near Mt.
