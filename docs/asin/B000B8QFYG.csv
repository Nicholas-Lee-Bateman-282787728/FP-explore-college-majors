There's hardly a new idea to be found.  Almost all of the one-liners and visual gags are taken directly from the previous film.  Rolling film stock, interruptions in the story by characters who make comments to the audience, even the ""pull the lever"" joke is repeated, and it was it was used twice in the original film!That said, young kids will probably be taken in by the vivid colors and frenetic action.

938008,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000B8QFYG,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[11, 13]","For starters, I haven't seen The Emperor's New Groove, so I'm pretty much judging this sequel on its own merits.  I liked a lot of things about Kronk's New Groove - maybe I would have enjoyed it less if I could judge it against the first movie, but maybe not.  The only real negative about this one is its length - the credits start rolling after a mere 67 minutes, and that qualifies as short in my book.  In a way, though, the length speaks to the whole aura of the film.  Kronk's New Groove isn't about trying to impress you with the latest supercool animation techniques or framing an epic story that will be talked about for decades to come.  I think it's just trying to entertain and, to some extent, deliver a wholesome message, and it does it in a fairly laid-back manner.Kronk (Patrick Warburton) is now a chef (and, lest we forget, chief delivery boy) at a popular diner, his henchman days all in his past.  He's pretty happy with his job and all of his friends there in town.  Then, from out of the blue, he learns that his Papi is coming for a visit.  Kronk has always dreamed of the day when his father would tell him he's proud of him - but Papi's hopes for his son involve a wife and kids and a big house on the hill (and no cooking).  The kicker is the fact that Kronk actually had a house and a girl - sort of - for a while.  Cue the flashbacks.  First, we see Kronk get the big house on the hill after naively helping that dastardly Yzma (the still-meowlicious Eartha Kitt) with another one of her schemes.  Then we watch what happens when he meets the woman of his dreams, Ms. Birdwell (Tracey Ullman) at Camp Chippamuka.  Doing the right thing in the end, though, costs him both the house and the girl.  So what happens when Papi finally arrives?  What doesn't happen, as comic mischief ensues?  If you're wondering about Emperor Kuzco, he does manage to insert himself into the film every so often - even though this movie really isn't about him at all.There are some funny bits in this film.  There's a good helping of your basic, physical humor that youngsters will like, but the jokes I enjoyed the most were ones that a lot of youngsters probably won't ""get.""  In the case of one joke, the writer went way, way, way out of his way to deliver a grimace-worthy play on words that most folks under twenty probably won't even notice.  Then there's the big dance scene with Kronk and his girl grooving to some vintage Earth, Wind, and Fire - it's just one pop culture reference after another.  I loved it, but kids will probably just react to all the funny dancing going on.Kronk's New Groove isn't going to set a new bar for animated movies, but it's a good, funny film that entertained this adult and will surely entertain the youngsters it's basically aimed at.  The special features are fairly good, as well.  The behind-the-scenes featurette is child-oriented, and it's pretty funny in its own right.  Meanwhile, the two games, one of which puts you inside Kronk's mind, are decent and easy enough for a kid to understand and enjoy.  The DVD also comes with a plethora of sneak peeks at upcoming Disney movies.  Disney may not have hit a home run this time around, but Kronk's New Groove is certainly a solid double into the gap.",4,"Kronk won't get a ""nostril flare of total rejection"" from me",1134432000,"12 13, 2005",2005,3254,"['starters', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Emperor', 'New', 'Groove', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'much', 'judging', 'sequel', 'own', 'merits', 'liked', 'lot', 'things', 'Kronk', 'New', 'Groove', 'maybe', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'less', 'could', 'judge', 'first', 'movie', 'maybe', 'not', 'only', 'real', 'negative', 'one', 'length', 'credits', 'start', 'rolling', 'mere', '67', 'minutes', 'short', 'book', 'way', 'though', 'length', 'whole', 'aura', 'film', 'Kronk', 'New', 'Groove', ""n't"", 'about', 'trying', 'impress', 'latest', 'supercool', 'animation', 'techniques', 'framing', 'epic', 'story', 'will', 'be', 'talked', 'decades', 'come', 'think', 'just', 'trying', 'entertain', 'extent', 'deliver', 'wholesome', 'message', 'fairly', 'laid-back', 'manner.Kronk', 'Patrick', 'Warburton', 'now', 'chef', 'lest', 'forget', 'chief', 'delivery', 'boy', 'popular', 'diner', 'henchman', 'days', 'past', 'pretty', 'happy', 'job', 'friends', 'there', 'town', 'Then', 'blue', 'Papi', 'coming', 'visit', 'Kronk', 'always', 'dreamed', 'day', 'when', 'father', 'would', 'tell', 'proud', 'Papi', 'hopes', 'son', 'involve', 'wife', 'kids', 'big', 'house', 'hill', 'cooking', 'kicker', 'fact', 'Kronk', 'actually', 'had', 'house', 'girl', 'sort', 'while', 'Cue', 'flashbacks', 'First', 'see', 'Kronk', 'get', 'big', 'house', 'hill', 'naively', 'helping', 'dastardly', 'Yzma', 'still-meowlicious', 'Eartha', 'Kitt', 'one', 'schemes', 'Then', 'watch', 'what', 'when', 'woman', 'dreams', 'Ms.', 'Birdwell', 'Tracey', 'Ullman', 'Camp', 'Chippamuka', 'Doing', 'right', 'thing', 'end', 'house', 'girl', 'what', 'when', 'Papi', 'finally', 'What', ""n't"", 'happen', 'comic', 'mischief', 'ensues', ""'re"", 'wondering', 'Emperor', 'Kuzco', 'manage', 'insert', 'film', 'so', 'often', 'even', 'movie', 'really', ""n't"", 'are', 'funny', 'bits', 'film', 'good', 'helping', 'basic', 'physical', 'humor', 'youngsters', 'will', 'like', 'jokes', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'were', 'ones', 'lot', 'youngsters', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'case', 'one', 'joke', 'writer', 'went', 'way', 'way', 'way', 'way', 'deliver', 'grimace-worthy', 'play', 'words', 'most', 'folks', 'twenty', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'notice', 'Then', 'big', 'dance', 'scene', 'Kronk', 'girl', 'grooving', 'vintage', 'Earth', 'Wind', 'Fire', 'just', 'one', 'pop', 'culture', 'reference', 'loved', 'kids', 'will', 'probably', 'just', 'react', 'funny', 'dancing', 'going', 'New', 'Groove', ""n't"", 'going', 'set', 'new', 'bar', 'animated', 'movies', 'good', 'funny', 'film', 'entertained', 'adult', 'will', 'surely', 'entertain', 'youngsters', 'basically', 'aimed', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'fairly', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurette', 'child-oriented', 'pretty', 'funny', 'own', 'right', 'Meanwhile', 'two', 'games', 'one', 'Kronk', 'mind', 'are', 'decent', 'easy', 'enough', 'kid', 'understand', 'enjoy', 'DVD', 'also', 'plethora', 'sneak', 'peeks', 'upcoming', 'Disney', 'movies', 'Disney', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'hit', 'home', 'run', 'time', 'around', 'Kronk', 'New', 'Groove', 'certainly', 'solid', 'double', 'gap']",Kronk's New Groove

Surely that is all that matters then, eh? Well, no. Compared to the first film, the story is pretty tepid.All of the previous characters return. Of course there is Kronk himself, along with Kuzco, Pacha and his family, the babbling squirrel and Yzma (who has now turned mostly back into a 'human' but still features a cat's tail and feline abilities). The movie tries to incorporate all of them into the story but nothing really sticks. It all just seems like an excuse for mayhem.As before, it is told in flashback with Kronk explaining how he ended up in such sorry circumstances. His dad is coming to visit him and he's afraid of the inevitable disapproval he'll get as all he's managed to do with his life is be a Junior Chipmunk Troup Leader and run a restaurant kitchen. His dad thinks that cooking and talking to animals isn't a 'real job' and won't give Kronk the big thumbs up until he's got his own house on a hill with loads of money.From this thin idea comes loads of deception, scheming and hijinks. And that's basically the movie. It IS packed full of hilarious moments and wonderful Looney Tunes-inspired humor like the first, but it just lacks that overall high-quality. Still, it's loads of fun and any fan of The Emperor's New Groove must give it a rent.The DVD is in 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby Digital and DTS 5.1 soundtracks.

There's a good helping of your basic, physical humor that youngsters will like, but the jokes I enjoyed the most were ones that a lot of youngsters probably won't ""get.""I have the strange suspicion that ""Kronk's New Groove"" might actually play better for adults than for children, even though the latter are clearly the target audience. That is because I think the funniest things in the movie tend to be the references to other films, from ""Pulp Fiction"" to ""Lady and the Tramp,"" and kids are just not going to be able to catch everything. Plus, the romance between Kronk and Miss Birdwell might distract kids from the point about sportsmanship that the movie wants to make.

938015,A3BC8YL69NOCUP,B000B8QFYG,jmpg,"[1, 1]","The Emperor's New Groove was definitely one of the more original and satisfyingly funny Disney films, straying away from the typical outcast-becomes-hero storyline that has been plaguing the company's  storytelling for years. To add insult to injury, they have been releasing sequels to all their classics. So upon hearing that they were adding a second 'New Groove' movie, it was both a skeptical and an exciting anticipation. Does Kronk's New Groove live up to its predecessor? Not quite. But much like The Three Musketeers before it, it is still one of the better straight-to-home features that Disney has released, and that alone makes it worth a look.In this sequel we follow Izma's former henchman, Kronk, and his background and hardships following the events of the first film. Most of the characters make a comeback here, and we are even introduced to a new one, Ms. Birdwell. Her persona is pretty questionable (why'd they give her an English accent?), and the romance between her and Kronk may turn people off, but luckily it's kept to a minimum. The movie retains a very similar visual flair to the first film, so those who enjoyed Emperor should have no difficulty adjusting to this one. The soundtrack has its own share of funky tunes to groove to, while all of the other original characters' voices make a short, but sweet, return.Kronk's New Groove still lacks the quick wit humor found in its predecessor, which will disappoint those looking for the same kind of laughs. And while it borrows a lot of the same comedic slapstick cues used in the first film, they aren't as effectively funny the second time around. It tries hard to imitate Emperor, but everything comes off recycled and tired. However, the movie makes up for it in its richer well-made storyline, at least enough to keep you interested all the way through. It also goes as far to teach some moral values, even more so than the previous film. As a sequel, this is a three-star movie. But standing on its own, it does deserve four stars.

938016,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B000B8QFYG,Joe Sherry,"[7, 44]","Disclaimer: I have not seen ""The Emperor's New Groove"" and have no idea what the movie may be about, except that I imagine it has something to do with an emperor who finds a new groove.  Whatever, exactly, that means.Now, with that disclaimer out of the way let's talk about the sequel to that movie: ""Kronk's New Groove"".  Kronk, to the best of my understanding, is a secondary character from the first movie who now gets his own film with his own misadventures.  Unfortunately, the storyline here is a bit unclear.  We start out with Kronk sitting in a puddle of liquid cheese that seems to have exploded out of a building and made a huge mess out of everything.  He tells us that he used to be somebody and that all of his troubles started earlier that day.  We flash back to earlier that day, but the events in the movie seem to take place over several days so perhaps there is another flashback that I missed as well.Kronk is a big lug of a muscle-bound man with a bigger heart and the respect of the townspeople.  Somehow he gets mixed up with an evil sorceress who is peddling some ""youth potion"" that doesn't really work but folks get kind of addicted to, but Kronk didn't want to get involved in selling the potions but he does because he thinks the sorceress can help with Kronk making his father proud.  But all this goes away pretty quickly and Kronk is living his life, working at a camp, being a cook and he meets this woman who is also at the camp and things go well, and then the don't, and then there is a big lesson learned and things may or may not be all good in the end depending on what you believe Disney will provide for an ending.  Shocking, all of it shocking.Or, not so shocking.  Honestly, midway through the movie I wasn't sure what ""Kronk's New Groove"" was all about.  After the movie was over I wasn't sure what ""Kronk's New Groove"" was all about.  As I'm writing this review the next morning, I'm not sure what ""Kronk's New Groove"" is all about.  If I can't even say with any real certainty what the point of the movie is, I can't recommend it.  There were too many musical montages, the movie didn't seem to have a point, the jokes weren't funny, and it was all fairly dull and unoriginal.There are a couple of bonus features on the DVD.  First off are two ""games"".  The first game makes no sense at all, but is kind of funny.  You are to help Kronk complete three tasks by selecting items that will help him in the task.  Kronk then goes through a description of how that item will help in the task and then says whether or not the idea will work.  Let's just say that the descriptions of how the items will help are by far the most creative and entertaining part of the movie.  The second game is ""Pyramid Scheme"" where you need to amass a certain number of points by answering three questions to move to the next round.  The questions are about the movie and also a little bit about the Incas.  I answered all of the questions correctly, so it wasn't too difficult.  The other bonus feature is a short documentary about how the movie was made.  Not as funny as it was intended to be.Here's the bottom line: I am a 26 year old male and I normally like Disney's animated movies.  ""Kronk's New Groove"" did nothing for me because I believe it is really intended only for children.  Children younger than the age of 10 will likely love this movie as it has bright colors, some silly jokes, exploding cheese, a nice moral message at the end about family and friends, and it should be fun for the youngsters.  So, parents should feel safe buying this DVD for their children.  Personally, I think there are far better options out there for children's movies, but this is a very safe, harmless movie for kids.  This movie will fit nicely into the children's market for which the movie is intended.  Unfortunately, this is not one which adults will enjoy as much as the kids.  It doesn't really work on that second level.  And that's fine too.Adult Grade: D +Children's Grade: B- (I'm just guessing here, I don't have kids yet).",2,"not much here for adults, but the kids might like it",1133740800,"12 5, 2005",2005,4054,"['Disclaimer', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'Emperor', 'New', 'Groove', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'imagine', 'something', 'do', 'emperor', 'who', 'new', 'groove', 'Whatever', 'exactly', 'means.Now', 'way', 'let', 'talk', 'sequel', 'movie', 'Kronk', 'New', 'Groove', 'Kronk', 'best', 'understanding', 'secondary', 'character', 'first', 'movie', 'who', 'now', 'own', 'film', 'own', 'misadventures', 'Unfortunately', 'storyline', 'here', 'bit', 'unclear', 'start', 'out', 'Kronk', 'sitting', 'puddle', 'liquid', 'cheese', 'have', 'exploded', 'building', 'made', 'huge', 'mess', 'everything', 'used', 'be', 'somebody', 'troubles', 'started', 'earlier', 'day', 'flash', 'back', 'earlier', 'day', 'events', 'movie', 'seem', 'take', 'place', 'several', 'days', 'so', 'perhaps', 'flashback', 'missed', 'well.Kronk', 'big', 'lug', 'muscle-bound', 'man', 'bigger', 'heart', 'respect', 'townspeople', 'mixed', 'up', 'evil', 'sorceress', 'who', 'peddling', 'youth', 'potion', ""n't"", 'really', 'work', 'folks', 'get', 'kind', 'addicted', 'Kronk', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'involved', 'selling', 'potions', 'sorceress', 'can', 'help', 'Kronk', 'making', 'father', 'proud', 'away', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'Kronk', 'living', 'life', 'working', 'camp', 'being', 'cook', 'woman', 'who', 'also', 'camp', 'things', 'go', 'well', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'then', 'big', 'lesson', 'learned', 'things', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'good', 'end', 'depending', 'what', 'believe', 'Disney', 'will', 'provide', 'ending', 'Shocking', 'not', 'so', 'shocking', 'Honestly', 'midway', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'Kronk', 'New', 'Groove', 'was', 'movie', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'Kronk', 'New', 'Groove', 'was', 'about', ""'m"", 'writing', 'review', 'next', 'morning', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'Kronk', 'New', 'Groove', 'about', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'say', 'real', 'certainty', 'what', 'point', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'musical', 'montages', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'point', 'jokes', 'were', ""n't"", 'funny', 'was', 'fairly', 'dull', 'unoriginal.There', 'are', 'couple', 'bonus', 'features', 'DVD', 'First', 'off', 'are', 'two', 'games', 'first', 'game', 'sense', 'kind', 'funny', 'are', 'help', 'Kronk', 'complete', 'three', 'tasks', 'selecting', 'items', 'will', 'help', 'task', 'Kronk', 'then', 'description', 'how', 'item', 'will', 'help', 'task', 'then', 'not', 'idea', 'will', 'work', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'descriptions', 'how', 'items', 'will', 'help', 'are', 'far', 'most', 'creative', 'entertaining', 'part', 'movie', 'second', 'game', 'Pyramid', 'Scheme', 'where', 'need', 'amass', 'certain', 'number', 'points', 'answering', 'three', 'questions', 'move', 'next', 'round', 'questions', 'are', 'movie', 'also', 'little', 'bit', 'Incas', 'answered', 'questions', 'correctly', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'difficult', 'other', 'bonus', 'feature', 'short', 'documentary', 'how', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'Not', 'as', 'funny', 'was', 'intended', 'be.Here', 'bottom', 'line', 'am', '26', 'year', 'old', 'male', 'normally', 'Disney', 'animated', 'movies', 'Kronk', 'New', 'Groove', 'did', 'nothing', 'believe', 'really', 'intended', 'only', 'children', 'Children', 'younger', 'age', '10', 'will', 'likely', 'love', 'movie', 'bright', 'colors', 'silly', 'jokes', 'exploding', 'cheese', 'nice', 'moral', 'message', 'end', 'family', 'friends', 'should', 'be', 'fun', 'youngsters', 'So', 'parents', 'should', 'feel', 'safe', 'buying', 'DVD', 'children', 'Personally', 'think', 'are', 'far', 'better', 'options', 'out', 'there', 'children', 'movies', 'very', 'safe', 'harmless', 'movie', 'kids', 'movie', 'will', 'fit', 'nicely', 'children', 'market', 'movie', 'intended', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'one', 'adults', 'will', 'enjoy', 'as', 'much', 'kids', ""n't"", 'really', 'work', 'second', 'level', 'fine', 'too.Adult', 'Grade', 'D', '+Children', 'Grade', 'B-', ""'m"", 'just', 'guessing', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'kids', 'yet']",Kronk's New Groove

I bought the movie because I loved the original flick, and was hoping that maybe they'd done something more creative with Kronk than they usually do.I was extremely disappointed and will probably never by another direct to DVD release from Disney again.All of the characters from the original are included in the movie, as are all of the original gags.  The gags don't work this time because they are almost exactly the same gags we saw in the first movie, and the chemistry between the characters isn't there to make them work.  The writing and story are both mediocre and best, and are nothing like what Disney is capable of.  It's very evident to me that Disney puts the B team to work to make the direct to DVD movies, while reserving the A team for feature films, and the end product shows it.The only reason I can see for buying this movie is if you have small children who haven't gotten tired of the story line.

938019,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000B8QFYG,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[4, 4]","""Kronk's New Groove"" is a direct to video sequel to Disney's 2000 animated feature ""The Emperor's New Groove,"" and the basic rule of thumb that at best such sequels end up being one star less than the original holds true here.  Kronk (voiced by Patrick Warburton), was the chef who became the less than stellar right-hand-man for Yzma (Eartha Kitt) in her attempt to become the ruler of the mythical South American empire ruled by Kuzco (David Spade).  Now Kronk is in the spotlight and gets to prove that he can get into lots of trouble all by himself, as if we have any doubts on that score in the first place.There are several entwined plot lines at work in ""Kronk's New Groove.""  The main one turns out to be Kronk's involvement as the leader of a Chipmunk troop, where he is teaching kids to win at any cost until he meets Miss Birdwell (Tracey Ullman) and learns that maybe winning is not the only thing.  Unfortunately, he fails to pass that particular lesson on to his young charges.  Meanwhile, Kronk, who is relatively happy working as the head chef at his own diner, learns that his Papi (John Mahoney) is coming for a visit.  Kronk has been waiting his whole life for his father to give him a sign of approval and when he looks at the life he is leading he knows it is not likely to happen this time either.  As for Yzma, she is still trying to cause trouble now that she is back in (mostly) human form (the tail is a nice reminder).  Everything comes together at the end as even Pacha (John Goodman) shows up for the comic resolution of everything in the requisite happy ending.Overall, I have the strange suspicion that ""Kronk's New Groove"" might actually play better for adults than for children, even though the latter are clearly the target audience.  That is because I think the funniest things in the movie tend to be the references to other films, from ""Pulp Fiction"" to ""Lady and the Tramp,"" and kids are just not going to be able to catch everything.  Plus, the romance between Kronk and Miss Birdwell might distract kids from the point about sportsmanship that the movie wants to make.  Kuzco pops up from time to time to remind us that he still needs a major ego adjustment, but he is just distracting and has his own spin-off, ""The Emperor's New School,"" coming out next year for those who like Spade in low-gear.The DVD bonus materials are scaled down for a direct to video DVD, with ""Kronk's Brain Game"" and ""Pyramid Scheme"" checking how well you paid attention to the movie (it took me three times to beat the latter; I feel so ashamed).  There is also a short featurette on ""How to Cook a Movie"" that provides youngsters with the basics of how a movie like this gets made.  The bottom line on this one is to simply follow the lead of your children.  If ""The Emperor's New Groove"" is one of their favorite Disney films, then they should enjoy this sequel.

I thoroughly enjoyed it and was either smiling or laughing all the way through.  However, I will agree it isn't quite as good as The Emporer's New Groove because it is too beholden to the style of its predecesser.What's that mean?  It means the format of the story is quite similar including starting with our hero's lowest moment and relating how he got there in flashback.  Also, there are several re-used jokes that are taken directly from Emporer.  Some work, like the repeated devil and angel gags.  Others seemed forced, including the appearance of the Emporer himself to interrupt the film and even draw diagrams on its still frames.  They're still funny moments, but the movie would do better to stand on its own, which it does more often than not.Also, though I am a big fan of the original, I am not particularly attached to the Emporer.  David Spade did a fine job in the first film, but I actually find his character's presence in this film forced and unnecessary.  If the Emporer was your favorite character, you'll be disappointed with the film.  Actually, I found it refreshing that they were willing to relegate the stars to the background and allow so many minor characters to step into the spotlight.  But not eveyone evidently feels the same.Despite some brief lapses into self-referencial humor, it's chock full of gags and witty, silly dialogue.

Kronk's New Groove becomes one of the lastes in the long string of Disney animated movie sequels, since they brought out The Rescures Down Under in 1990.

Kronk works as head (and well) only chef in the restaurant, along with head delivery boy, which might also make him the only delivery boy, but the movie does't go that far.

938037,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000B8QFYG,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 4]","`Kronk's New Groove' is made as a sequel to `Emperor's New Groove' in 2000. The original was a surprisingly good animation with wacky humor abound thanks to the great visuals and effective voice cast from David Spade, Eartha Kitt and John Goodman.In the sequel, unfortunately however, none of them (and the characters to play) is given enough time to impress us. The above mentioned three stars come back as their original character -- as Kuzco the Emperor, Yzma now a human with a long cat-like tail, and of course Pacha, respectively -- but it is Kronk who plays the main lead of the film.Frankly the film's story is weak and at times confusing. You can divide this short 72 minute film into two parts, none of which is interesting enough for adults. Kids might find it otherwise - I don't know for I don't have kids yet - but if you think the episodes about Kronk selling counterfeit green potion to the good old folks of the village, and one of them, believing that he is young again, suddenly take off his clothes and speaks like Golem of `LOTR'... well, if you think this is funny and interesting, it is your film. Other episodes include stern Kronk's father coming to the restaurant where Kronk works, and Kronk's sweetheart Ms Birdwell (Tracey Ullman) and how they fall in love (with a disco dance sequence). Those episodes are told in a flashback (with a flashback within flashback), which is not only confusing but also pointless.Kronk (Patrick Warburton) is again an amusing, and very likable character, and we meet new character Ms. Birdwell in the latter half of the film. They are both so-so, but what is really disappointing is that the film fails to fully use the character of wicked Yzma, who suddenly disappears halfway through the story. And as to the Emperor's role, he is nothing but a cameo, just a meaningless spectator who is watching the entire show outside the film's story.`Kronk's New Groove's provides some good sight gags, and the directors are obviously trying to retain the Tex Avery-like wacky fast-paced visual touch of the first film, but it is painfully clear that they need either more budget, time, or imagination.As you know, `Emperor's New Groove' came out a winner after going through very troubled production process, in which the filmmakers had to change the story drastically. It is that kind of drastic decision that Disney really needs to take about the sequel. 'Kronk' is not bad as a whole, but falls short of the infectious feeling of joy of 'Emperor.'",3,Mildly Entertaining But Falls Short of the Infectious Humor of the Emperor,1140480000,"02 21, 2006",2006,2501,"['Kronk', 'New', 'Groove', 'made', 'sequel', 'Emperor', 'New', 'Groove', '2000', 'original', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'animation', 'wacky', 'humor', 'thanks', 'great', 'visuals', 'effective', 'voice', 'cast', 'David', 'Spade', 'Eartha', 'Kitt', 'John', 'Goodman.In', 'sequel', 'unfortunately', 'however', 'none', 'characters', 'play', 'given', 'enough', 'time', 'impress', 'above', 'mentioned', 'three', 'stars', 'come', 'back', 'original', 'character', 'Kuzco', 'Emperor', 'Yzma', 'now', 'human', 'long', 'cat-like', 'tail', 'course', 'Pacha', 'respectively', 'Kronk', 'who', 'main', 'lead', 'film.Frankly', 'film', 'story', 'weak', 'times', 'confusing', 'can', 'divide', 'short', '72', 'minute', 'film', 'two', 'parts', 'none', 'interesting', 'enough', 'adults', 'Kids', 'might', 'find', 'otherwise', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'kids', 'yet', 'think', 'episodes', 'Kronk', 'selling', 'counterfeit', 'green', 'potion', 'good', 'old', 'folks', 'village', 'one', 'believing', 'young', 'again', 'suddenly', 'take', 'off', 'clothes', 'speaks', 'Golem', 'LOTR', 'well', 'think', 'funny', 'interesting', 'film', 'Other', 'episodes', 'include', 'stern', 'Kronk', 'father', 'coming', 'restaurant', 'where', 'Kronk', 'Kronk', 'sweetheart', 'Ms', 'Birdwell', 'Tracey', 'Ullman', 'how', 'fall', 'love', 'disco', 'dance', 'sequence', 'episodes', 'are', 'told', 'flashback', 'flashback', 'flashback', 'not', 'only', 'confusing', 'also', 'pointless.Kronk', 'Patrick', 'Warburton', 'again', 'amusing', 'very', 'likable', 'character', 'meet', 'new', 'character', 'Ms.', 'Birdwell', 'latter', 'half', 'film', 'are', 'so-so', 'what', 'really', 'disappointing', 'film', 'fully', 'use', 'character', 'wicked', 'Yzma', 'who', 'suddenly', 'halfway', 'story', 'Emperor', 'role', 'nothing', 'cameo', 'just', 'meaningless', 'spectator', 'who', 'watching', 'entire', 'show', 'film', 'story.', 'Kronk', 'New', 'Groove', 'good', 'sight', 'gags', 'directors', 'are', 'obviously', 'trying', 'retain', 'Tex', 'Avery-like', 'wacky', 'fast-paced', 'visual', 'touch', 'first', 'film', 'painfully', 'clear', 'need', 'more', 'budget', 'time', 'imagination.As', 'know', 'Emperor', 'New', 'Groove', 'came', 'out', 'winner', 'going', 'very', 'troubled', 'production', 'process', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'change', 'story', 'drastically', 'kind', 'drastic', 'decision', 'Disney', 'really', 'take', 'sequel', 'not', 'bad', 'whole', 'short', 'infectious', 'feeling', 'joy', ""'Emperor""]",Kronk's New Groove
