The stupid black rectangle box appears in the Ex-Files episode. I already had that with the copy I made from a tv showing. And no controls on the dvd to change Viewing rating. Becker the show, 10 stars out of 5. Who ever put this dvd release together 1 star. Personal note: if Becker was a real doctor and lived near me, I would search him out to be my doctor. I did love the Sizzle reel, the cast interviews, the audience warm up reel, and the gag reel. Sure I could have said extras or special features but this gives more information, Those I give 5 stars.
