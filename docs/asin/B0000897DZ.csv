We love all the adventures he has and I particularly like how he treats his baby sister Rosie.  He can't stand to hear her cry and really watches over her. This a wonderful show for any collection!,5,Adorable and Great Show,1166572800,"12 20, 2006",2006,326,"['Caillou', 'most', 'adorable', 'little', 'boy', 'there', 'family', 'Caillou', 'almost', 'extension', 'family', 'love', 'adventures', 'particularly', 'how', 'baby', 'sister', 'Rosie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'hear', 'cry', 'really', 'watches', 'wonderful', 'show', 'collection']",Caillou - Big Brother Caillou & Other Adventures

Slaybaugh,"[8, 18]","Although Calliou may be appropriate for teaching some aspects of children's growth, I have to agree with the speaker who said that he essentially teaches children to whine and complain when they dont get their own way. Although, in today's ""If you spank/discipline/forbid your children anything you're a horrid monster"" society, I'm sure he and his eternally ""Now Calliou...."" parents are the wave of the future. Let the parent beware!** Since writing the above review, PBS has altered the format of its show, and Caillou seems to be much less whiny and the parents a little more discipline oriented.
