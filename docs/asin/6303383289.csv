371405,A12YVS06GZEFZE,6303383289,Barbara Farr Kelley,"[6, 6]","This is one of those Steve Martin films that should always be available for purchase.  It is my favorite of his, along with All of Me.A Simple Twist of Fate is the story of a man who finds out the baby his wife is  carrying is not his.  She leaves him to go to this other man.He spends  his time afterwards buying expensive gold coins and polishing them and  staring at them every day until one day a man steals all his coins and runs  off with them.Steve Martin's character is real down about this time and  he just mopes around all day and doesn't talk to anybody.  Then, one day, a  simple twist of fate walks right into his life.  A little girl around a  year a half to two years old walks right into his house and chooses him as  a daddy.Her mama was a drug addict and she got her money for drugs from  a rich politician in town who was married, but who was the father of her  little girl.  The mama wanted more money and the man wouldn't give it to  her, so she packed the little girl and herself into the car and drove in  the snow to go see the politician.  But on the way, the car wouldn't work  any more and the woman and little girl walked in the snow.  The mother was  all high on dope and she died not far from Steve Martin's house, and the  little girl saw the light in his window and walked right on in just like it  was her own house.Steve Martin adopted her and the little girl grew up  to love him like her own daddy. Her real daddy (Gabriel Byrne)was still a  politician in town but nobody knew it until the real daddy wanted to lay  claim to his daughter, who was now about 10 or 12 years old.  Now there  would be a court battle on who would gain or keep custody of little  Matilda.I believe everyone should see this movie, and since the  producers are not producing this movie any more, I'm sure you could rent a  copy at your nearest video rental store.In the meantime, won't you  producers PLEASE bring back this beautiful and tender movie so that I can  buy a copy of it?

371411,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,6303383289,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 1]","A SIMPLE TWIST OF FATE (writ. Steve Martin, dir. Gillies MacKinnon, 1994, 105 minutes) is a rather fun film considering its general subject matter - or if I may put that differently, it represents the dangers of attempting to update an old story.If you have read the 19th century novel ""Silas Marner"" by George Eliot, you know right away that this film ""was suggested by"" that novel. Though Steve Martin was a bit new to drama when he did this - and it shows somewhat - he turns in a humorous yet serious performance as the reclusive, miserly carpenter Michael McCann (based on the reclusive, miserly epileptic weaver Silas Marner).Now if you are of a literary bent, you will know Silas Marner is excommunicated from his church on false grounds of theft, creeps off to live like a reclusive stranger in a small town, happens to assist a neighbor with an herbal cure and is thus shoved even further into reclusiveness when he gains the reputation of being some kind of witch. His epilepsy does not help. He of course becomes a hoarder - but only of the small bit of money he earned from his newfound 'skill' as an herbalist. A little girl wanders into his cottage while he is in the throes of a fit, and ...... cue Steve Martin. A greedy carpenter who collects and hoardes gold coins, he is robbed one night by a weird local who vanishes. After some awful shenanigans which frankly smack of pathetic stabs at Dickensian tragedy, McCann is left with a cute toddler. He adopts her and life is changed for him. As with Marner, when the real father acts the heel and tries to get his natural daughter back, there is a fight.Now: there are several problems with Martin's efforts here. In the first place, I cannot tell if this is supposed to be northern Georgia (where it was filmed), North Carolina (a phone number in the film suggests that) or Kentucky or what. ""Silas Marner"" of course takes place in England at the start of the 19th century. The ugliest part is the unfolding of the drama: there is lots of loss here, and I think the actors mostly sleepwalk through that. It is unpardonable even for an early 1990s film.The charming and breathtaking 10-year-old Mathilda (Alana Austin) seems awfully anxious to stay with her natural father even though on a certain level she loathes him - and it doesn't seem to bother her that her 'real' father, McCann, will be left holding the can. (Recall, he WAS a rich old miser and has been poor many years after his gold was stolen.) After all, the swine who is her natural father (an excellent but rather subdued Gabriel Byrne) has given her a horse!This is an interesting and thought-provoking endeavor, albeit a lazy one. Martin was reaching for the stars and one has to credit him for that. This kind of classic-story-updating is simply not done enough, and when it is done (witnessSherlock: Season Two) it is done horribly. At least these folks managed a passable, 'nearly' family film (there are a few explicit scenes of a sexual nature and drug abuse). Yet the deficiencies are so gross as to be disturbing. I know they had well under two hours but I would have preferred to see a two hour treatment that delves into McCann being excommunicated from a religious community, etc.The way it is simply drains it of much of its original and powerful impact. In any case, I like it well enough to want to own it on DVD - I have a feeling you will like it too. Very likely moreso than Eliot's novel.",3,An overly simple twist of Martin,1340323200,"06 22, 2012",2012,3438,"['SIMPLE', 'TWIST', 'OF', 'FATE', 'writ', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'dir', 'Gillies', 'MacKinnon', '1994', '105', 'minutes', 'rather', 'fun', 'film', 'considering', 'general', 'subject', 'matter', 'may', 'put', 'differently', 'dangers', 'attempting', 'update', 'old', 'story.If', 'have', 'read', '19th', 'century', 'novel', 'Silas', 'Marner', 'George', 'Eliot', 'know', 'right', 'away', 'film', 'was', 'suggested', 'novel', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'was', 'bit', 'new', 'drama', 'when', 'did', 'somewhat', 'humorous', 'yet', 'serious', 'performance', 'reclusive', 'miserly', 'carpenter', 'Michael', 'McCann', 'based', 'reclusive', 'miserly', 'epileptic', 'weaver', 'Silas', 'Marner', '.Now', 'are', 'literary', 'bent', 'will', 'know', 'Silas', 'Marner', 'excommunicated', 'church', 'false', 'grounds', 'theft', 'live', 'reclusive', 'stranger', 'small', 'town', 'assist', 'neighbor', 'herbal', 'cure', 'thus', 'shoved', 'even', 'further', 'reclusiveness', 'when', 'gains', 'reputation', 'being', 'kind', 'witch', 'epilepsy', 'not', 'help', 'course', 'hoarder', 'only', 'small', 'bit', 'money', 'earned', 'newfound', ""'skill"", 'herbalist', 'little', 'girl', 'wanders', 'cottage', 'throes', 'fit', 'cue', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'greedy', 'carpenter', 'who', 'hoardes', 'gold', 'coins', 'robbed', 'one', 'night', 'weird', 'local', 'who', 'vanishes', 'awful', 'shenanigans', 'frankly', 'smack', 'pathetic', 'stabs', 'Dickensian', 'tragedy', 'McCann', 'left', 'cute', 'toddler', 'life', 'changed', 'Marner', 'when', 'real', 'father', 'heel', 'tries', 'get', 'natural', 'daughter', 'back', 'fight.Now', 'are', 'several', 'problems', 'Martin', 'efforts', 'here', 'first', 'place', 'can', 'not', 'tell', 'supposed', 'be', 'northern', 'Georgia', 'where', 'was', 'filmed', 'North', 'Carolina', 'phone', 'number', 'film', 'Kentucky', 'what', 'Silas', 'Marner', 'course', 'place', 'England', 'start', '19th', 'century', 'ugliest', 'part', 'unfolding', 'drama', 'lots', 'loss', 'here', 'think', 'actors', 'mostly', 'sleepwalk', 'unpardonable', 'even', 'early', '1990s', 'film.The', 'charming', 'breathtaking', '10-year-old', 'Mathilda', 'Alana', 'Austin', 'awfully', 'anxious', 'stay', 'natural', 'father', 'even', 'certain', 'level', ""n't"", 'seem', 'bother', ""'real"", 'father', 'McCann', 'will', 'be', 'left', 'holding', 'can', 'Recall', 'WAS', 'rich', 'old', 'miser', 'been', 'poor', 'many', 'years', 'gold', 'was', 'stolen', 'swine', 'who', 'natural', 'father', 'excellent', 'rather', 'subdued', 'Gabriel', 'Byrne', 'given', 'horse', 'interesting', 'thought-provoking', 'endeavor', 'lazy', 'one', 'Martin', 'was', 'reaching', 'stars', 'one', 'credit', 'kind', 'classic-story-updating', 'simply', 'not', 'done', 'enough', 'when', 'done', 'witnessSherlock', 'Season', 'Two', 'done', 'horribly', 'least', 'folks', 'managed', 'passable', ""'nearly"", 'family', 'film', 'are', 'few', 'explicit', 'scenes', 'sexual', 'nature', 'drug', 'abuse', 'deficiencies', 'are', 'so', 'gross', 'be', 'disturbing', 'know', 'had', 'well', 'two', 'hours', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'see', 'two', 'hour', 'treatment', 'McCann', 'being', 'excommunicated', 'religious', 'community', 'etc.The', 'way', 'simply', 'much', 'original', 'powerful', 'impact', 'case', 'like', 'well', 'enough', 'want', 'own', 'DVD', 'have', 'feeling', 'will', 'like', 'too', 'Very', 'likely', 'moreso', 'Eliot', 'novel']",A Simple Twist of Fate VHS

On one hand, it lovingly portrays the relationship between a single adoptive father and his daughter. Steve Martin's humor and gentleness, as well as an underlying sadness, permeate the role he plays. I love seeing the interactions between him and his daughter as she grows up. On the other hand, the stereotypical drama in the last half of the movie - custody battles, courtroom dramas, a biological parent who tries to steal away the child he abandoned - damage the movie's credibility for me. Also, I hated the constant use of the outdated and offensive words ""real father"" whenever anyone referred to the child's biological father. The original classic and the moral of that story is lost - the love of the daughter for her father overcomes class differences. The moral of this story instead seems to be that of ""money wins"" - that is, the adoptive father gets to keep his daughter as soon as he can prove that he has the money to do so. I thought the ending cheapened the movie.",3,mixed feelings,1155859200,"08 18, 2006",2006,1075,"['SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'adoptive', 'parent', 'have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'movie', 'one', 'hand', 'lovingly', 'relationship', 'single', 'adoptive', 'father', 'daughter', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'humor', 'gentleness', 'as', 'well', 'underlying', 'sadness', 'permeate', 'role', 'love', 'seeing', 'interactions', 'daughter', 'up', 'other', 'hand', 'stereotypical', 'drama', 'last', 'half', 'movie', 'custody', 'battles', 'courtroom', 'dramas', 'biological', 'parent', 'who', 'steal', 'away', 'child', 'abandoned', 'damage', 'movie', 'credibility', 'Also', 'hated', 'constant', 'use', 'outdated', 'offensive', 'words', 'real', 'father', 'anyone', 'referred', 'child', 'biological', 'father', 'original', 'classic', 'moral', 'story', 'lost', 'love', 'daughter', 'father', 'class', 'differences', 'moral', 'story', 'instead', 'be', 'money', 'wins', 'adoptive', 'father', 'keep', 'daughter', 'as', 'soon', 'can', 'prove', 'money', 'do', 'so', 'thought', 'ending', 'cheapened', 'movie']",A Simple Twist of Fate VHS
