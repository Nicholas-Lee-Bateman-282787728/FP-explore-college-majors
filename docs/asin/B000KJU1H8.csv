1034830,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B000KJU1H8,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[2, 2]","Following Sean is a heartfelt, thoughtful and insightful documentary that truly takes a good close look at a young boy, originally interviewed in 1969 by filmmaker Ralph Arlyck, and what happens to him many years later when he has become a full grown man. The cinematography is excellent and I can see why the film won awards; it's all done so very well. (It did receive criticism, too, for showing what some people felt was wrong with America.) As others state, the film progresses at a good pace never feeling forced, too fast or too slow. It truly held my interest every step of the way! The quality of the original 1969 print is very good especially when you consider that it was not filmed using Hollywood studio quality equipment.We see four year old Sean answering some questions posed to him by Ralph Arlyck; Arlyck had moved to San Francisco to experience the freedom loving/youthful California lifestyle of the 1960s and just two stories above him in the same apartment building was Sean in an apartment with his parents--and quite a few people coming and going with Sean's father and mother considering their apartment as ""an oasis"" for anyone who needed a brief safe haven while they were transients on drugs or running from spouses who had abused them. Sean's father teaches Sean how to use tools at a very early age and we see Sean loving it all; he's also quite intelligent--you can tell by the way 4 year old Sean answers Ralph's questions!Ralph sensed some similarities between his own family and Sean's family (liberal parents, creativity, thinking outside the box, etc.) so quite a few years later--just about thirty, in fact, Ralph returns to San Francisco and he meets Sean again on a corner in the Haight-Ashbury district where they all lived previously. It's initially quite something to see Sean looking so different; but it didn't take long for me to see similarities in Sean's facial features and actually Sean's basic way of thinking is not unlike his earlier ways only much more mature.For the next decade Ralph Arlyck follows Sean going through his life; we see Sean doing contracting work as an engineer and there are fascinating interviews with the immediate members of Sean's family and Ralph's family. The similarities and differences between Sean's family and life are explored along with how Ralph's life is progressing including romantic relationships with women.It may seem as if I've given too much away but I assure you that is not the case. There is plenty more to this story!The DVD comes with some great extras. I particularly liked the bonus scenes; the original 14 minute film of Sean from 1969 and the filmmaker interview.People who enjoy biographical documentaries with social and cultural themes would do well to add this to their collections. I highly recommend this film.",5,don't pass this by,1352246400,"11 7, 2012",2012,2820,"['Following', 'Sean', 'heartfelt', 'thoughtful', 'insightful', 'documentary', 'truly', 'good', 'close', 'look', 'young', 'boy', 'originally', 'interviewed', '1969', 'filmmaker', 'Ralph', 'Arlyck', 'what', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'when', 'become', 'full', 'grown', 'man', 'cinematography', 'excellent', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'film', 'won', 'awards', 'done', 'so', 'very', 'well', 'did', 'receive', 'criticism', 'too', 'showing', 'what', 'people', 'felt', 'was', 'wrong', 'America', 'others', 'state', 'film', 'good', 'pace', 'never', 'feeling', 'forced', 'too', 'fast', 'too', 'slow', 'truly', 'held', 'interest', 'step', 'way', 'quality', 'original', '1969', 'print', 'very', 'good', 'especially', 'when', 'consider', 'was', 'not', 'filmed', 'using', 'Hollywood', 'studio', 'quality', 'equipment.We', 'see', 'four', 'year', 'old', 'Sean', 'answering', 'questions', 'posed', 'Ralph', 'Arlyck', 'Arlyck', 'had', 'moved', 'San', 'Francisco', 'experience', 'freedom', 'loving/youthful', 'California', 'lifestyle', '1960s', 'just', 'two', 'stories', 'same', 'apartment', 'building', 'was', 'Sean', 'apartment', 'parents', 'quite', 'few', 'people', 'coming', 'going', 'Sean', 'father', 'mother', 'considering', 'apartment', 'oasis', 'anyone', 'who', 'needed', 'brief', 'safe', 'haven', 'were', 'transients', 'drugs', 'running', 'spouses', 'who', 'had', 'abused', 'Sean', 'father', 'teaches', 'Sean', 'how', 'use', 'tools', 'very', 'early', 'age', 'see', 'Sean', 'loving', 'also', 'quite', 'intelligent', 'can', 'tell', 'way', '4', 'year', 'old', 'Sean', 'Ralph', 'questions', 'Ralph', 'sensed', 'similarities', 'own', 'family', 'Sean', 'family', 'liberal', 'parents', 'creativity', 'thinking', 'box', 'etc', 'so', 'quite', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'just', 'thirty', 'fact', 'Ralph', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Sean', 'again', 'corner', 'Haight-Ashbury', 'district', 'where', 'lived', 'previously', 'initially', 'quite', 'something', 'see', 'Sean', 'looking', 'so', 'different', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'see', 'similarities', 'Sean', 'facial', 'features', 'actually', 'Sean', 'basic', 'way', 'thinking', 'not', 'earlier', 'ways', 'only', 'much', 'more', 'mature.For', 'next', 'decade', 'Ralph', 'Arlyck', 'Sean', 'going', 'life', 'see', 'Sean', 'doing', 'contracting', 'work', 'engineer', 'are', 'fascinating', 'interviews', 'immediate', 'members', 'Sean', 'family', 'Ralph', 'family', 'similarities', 'differences', 'Sean', 'family', 'life', 'are', 'explored', 'how', 'Ralph', 'life', 'progressing', 'including', 'romantic', 'relationships', 'women.It', 'may', 'seem', ""'ve"", 'given', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'assure', 'not', 'case', 'plenty', 'more', 'story', 'DVD', 'great', 'extras', 'particularly', 'liked', 'bonus', 'scenes', 'original', '14', 'minute', 'film', 'Sean', '1969', 'filmmaker', 'interview.People', 'who', 'enjoy', 'biographical', 'documentaries', 'social', 'cultural', 'themes', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'add', 'collections', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film']",Following Sean

I expected it to be how ""Sean,"" the chid of 60's hippies living in San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury, turned out twenty five years later. It's a good idea and as one who lived through that era myself, I was quite interested in seeing it.  There is a lot of good footage of Sean as a child and some of the neighborhood scene, including his parents.  And then later we see the same folks, plus Sean's new wife, son, his half brother. I liked all of that.I think the problem with the film is that it strays from focusing on Sean's family and introduces a lot of footage of the film maker's own family.  We see and hear a lot about his own life and that of his wife, two children and his parents over the years.  There are similarities to the two sets of families and if this had been the intention of the film maker this could have been an interesting film but a very different one. As it is, it rambles on between time frames and coasts and the two groups of families and the generations. There are some interesting parts, including his parents'eventual retirement to a Steiner farm commune but that had nothing to do with Sean.Some serious editing would have made this a tighter film with more emotional punch to it.

1034833,A1TK6WNUIAEQRU,B000KJU1H8,stoic,"[4, 5]","In the late-1960s San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury was the counterculture's ground zero. Filmmaker Ralph Arlyck lived in the Haight back then and made a movie about his four-year-old neighbor, Sean Farrell. Sean's parents allowed him to run barefoot in the streets and use marijuana.In the 1990s, Arlyck returned to San Francisco and tracked down Sean to see what had become of him. Sean and his family have differing opinions on the 1960s and their time in the Haight. The younger members, frankly, don't seem interested in the old counterculture.If Arlyck had better instincts, Following Sean could have great. He should have used his interviews to bring out the family's story and how the 1960s shaped (or didn't shape) them. Arlyck is a poor interviewer who talks over his subjects when they don't give him the answers that he wants. He also insults Sean's father, Johnny, by saying that Johnny abandons people when they become a burden. A skilled interviewer with a few social graces could have gotten more out of the interviews.A bigger problem is that, after the first 20 minutes or so, Arlyck makes himself the focus. Following Sean bogs down as Arlyck wallows in self-centered navel gazing and boring tangents. Viewers suffer through footage of Arlyck's two sons and of his cat. The sons show the same level of interest in the film as does the cat.Following Sean is mildly interesting.

1034834,A2ZHH7AK83JB5G,B000KJU1H8,"Susan K. Schoonover ""Sue Yingling""","[11, 15]","The premise for FOLLOWING SEAN is fascinating.  In 1969 while living in San Francisco Ralph Arlyck made a short documentary film about his four year old neighbor Sean which won many awards.  Sean lived in a ""crash pad"" above Arlyck's Haight-Ashbury apartment with his free thinking ""hippie"" parents, a couple of siblings plus assorted visitors and the precocious child spoke articulately (and to many shockingly) on camera about pot smoking, speed freaks and his contempt for the police.  The background of Sean's parents is also interesting as his father is the son of a banking family while his mother's parents were prominent Communists active in the organization of longshoremen.Arlyck moved back to the east coast following the success of the first ""Sean"" film but years later decides there might be another documentary to be made if he updated Sean and his family's lives.  Similarly to the subject of another well received documentary, STONE READER, Sean and his family are not that hard to find and their lives are not particularly extraordinary.  So to pad the movie to more of a feature length Arlyck includes lots of footage about his own family - his elderly left leaning Brooklyn parents, his French wife and his two college age sons, one of whom in my favorite quote from the movie tells his dad he is just ""fishing for sound bites"" when he grills  him on his reaction to the current Berkeley counterculture.The fact that Sean and his family are currently leading pretty normal lives is interesting in itself and I wish Arlyck had been content in just updating their story and getting some of their recollections and reactions to their lives in ""The Haight"" circa the late 60's.  Yet like so many documentary filmmakers Arlyck just doesn't seem to be able to keep the focus off himself or realize that a longer length doesn't necessarily equate with a better film.",3,Overly Padded,1209513600,"04 30, 2008",2008,1878,"['premise', 'FOLLOWING', 'SEAN', 'fascinating', '1969', 'living', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Ralph', 'Arlyck', 'made', 'short', 'documentary', 'film', 'four', 'year', 'old', 'neighbor', 'Sean', 'won', 'many', 'awards', 'Sean', 'lived', 'crash', 'pad', 'Arlyck', 'Haight-Ashbury', 'apartment', 'free', 'thinking', 'hippie', 'parents', 'couple', 'siblings', 'assorted', 'visitors', 'precocious', 'child', 'spoke', 'articulately', 'many', 'shockingly', 'camera', 'pot', 'smoking', 'speed', 'freaks', 'contempt', 'police', 'background', 'Sean', 'parents', 'also', 'interesting', 'father', 'son', 'banking', 'family', 'mother', 'parents', 'were', 'prominent', 'Communists', 'active', 'organization', 'longshoremen.Arlyck', 'moved', 'back', 'east', 'coast', 'following', 'success', 'first', 'Sean', 'film', 'years', 'later', 'decides', 'might', 'be', 'documentary', 'be', 'made', 'updated', 'Sean', 'family', 'lives', 'Similarly', 'subject', 'well', 'received', 'documentary', 'STONE', 'READER', 'Sean', 'family', 'are', 'not', 'that', 'hard', 'find', 'lives', 'are', 'not', 'particularly', 'extraordinary', 'So', 'pad', 'movie', 'more', 'feature', 'length', 'Arlyck', 'lots', 'footage', 'own', 'family', 'elderly', 'left', 'leaning', 'Brooklyn', 'parents', 'French', 'wife', 'two', 'college', 'age', 'sons', 'one', 'whom', 'favorite', 'quote', 'movie', 'dad', 'just', 'fishing', 'sound', 'bites', 'when', 'reaction', 'current', 'Berkeley', 'counterculture.The', 'fact', 'Sean', 'family', 'are', 'currently', 'leading', 'pretty', 'normal', 'lives', 'interesting', 'wish', 'Arlyck', 'had', 'been', 'content', 'just', 'updating', 'story', 'getting', 'recollections', 'reactions', 'lives', 'Haight', 'circa', 'late', '60', 'so', 'many', 'documentary', 'filmmakers', 'Arlyck', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'able', 'keep', 'focus', 'off', 'realize', 'longer', 'length', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'equate', 'better', 'film']",Following Sean
