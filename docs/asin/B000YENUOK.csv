It is no doubt that the Equalizer has gained a cult following. For some time, it has been syndicated on A&E, running episode after episode. I watched it fervently everyday. When A&E finally decided to discontinue it, they took out a big chunk out of my whole day. But at last, production people has finally heard the fans numerous calling and requests. Robert McCall (Edward Woodward) exemplifies the Man of compassion. As he tries to deal with his own demons for working as the ""extreme"" special agent of the CIA, to amend for his past acts, he tries to help people, often out of his way and spending his own finances. His newspaper ad ""Got a problem? Odds against you? Need help? Call the Equalizer"" signifies the one last hope for people who are in dire need of help. He is a vigilante within the boundaries of the law, for he enlists the help of law enforcement (along with his expertise) to give people the help they need. Of course his ""desire"" to help would  not be possible if it were not for his inside ""connections"" in the ""company."" Foremost of these connections were Control and Mickey Kostmeyer.

Now he earns little money on a mission to work for the poor and vulnerable, people whose lives are being ruined by career criminals. So far, so good - but in the wrong hands (and this was network TV, not cable) this could have been a forgettable, cliche-ridden mess, depicting McCall as a kind of driven 'super hero'. But no!The Equalizer was a show that avoided all of the usual crime and cop show traps, including car chases, cheesy dialogue and cardboard bad guys. Instead, we have McCall actually using his brain before storming off with a gun in his pocket - weighing up the odds, looking ahead at the consequences. Within minutes, you bought into the character and trusted the show.Not that The Equalizer didn't deliver its quota of grit and menace - it was, after all, notorious for its violence, and given a later than usual TV slot. The violence was neither gratuitous, nor cartoonish. Think French Connection urban roughness, and revel in an age when prime time network TV had any interest in 'doing something different'.Note: Seasons 2 and 3 are now available in the UK on region 2 DVD. The third season of The Equalizer has a special bonus: ROBERT MITCHUM, legendary Hollywood tough guy, bad boy and all-round fantastic actor, appears in two episodes [Mission: McCall part 1 and part 2] as an exceptionally cool spy (well, it is Mitchum, after all). Tantalizing to see him in a show like this - too bad no one had the creative impulse to devise a show like this for Mitchum at that point of his career.

1119628,A25JH6CO4DVINS,B000YENUOK,Junglies,"[14, 16]","Edward Woodward starred in a television show in Britain long before the Equalizer hit the streets of New York. The show was called 'Callan' and in many ways established his reputation. His character was a no nonsense assassin for the British government with psychological problems who was the best at what he did. While the drama series was less than well funded it was extremely realistic and cold blooded. Callous would have been an appropriate name.Having said this by way of pertinent background, we see a revamped secret agent, retired, living in New York and trying, at his own expense, to compensate for his deadly dealings in the past.This, stylish thriller, finally seeing the light of day in it's DVD release, is an accurate portrayal of New York in the eighties. In many ways it is a sad commentary on life in the Big Apple, if not a cry from the heart on behalf of the suffering citizenry.It is my understanding too that the sleek Jaguar which carries the agent, McCall, around town sparked a wave of buying of the marque as the show took hold, a much better buy than today's model.However, I digress. These stories are excellent and remind us of situations which will not be missed. The acting, and plots are generally of extremely high standard in the main although personally, I find the stories involving the son more than a little tedious. All in all though an excellent addition to anyone's collection. Hopefully the powers that be will see fit to add Callan to the future release list.",5,I'm Waiting for the Man,1202860800,"02 13, 2008",2008,1504,"['Edward', 'Woodward', 'starred', 'television', 'show', 'Britain', 'long', 'Equalizer', 'hit', 'streets', 'New', 'York', 'show', 'was', 'called', ""'Callan"", 'many', 'ways', 'established', 'reputation', 'character', 'was', 'nonsense', 'assassin', 'British', 'government', 'psychological', 'problems', 'who', 'was', 'best', 'what', 'did', 'drama', 'series', 'was', 'less', 'well', 'funded', 'was', 'extremely', 'realistic', 'cold', 'blooded', 'Callous', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'appropriate', 'name.Having', 'said', 'way', 'pertinent', 'background', 'see', 'revamped', 'secret', 'agent', 'retired', 'living', 'New', 'York', 'trying', 'own', 'expense', 'compensate', 'deadly', 'dealings', 'past.This', 'stylish', 'thriller', 'finally', 'seeing', 'light', 'day', 'DVD', 'release', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'New', 'York', 'eighties', 'many', 'ways', 'sad', 'commentary', 'life', 'Big', 'Apple', 'not', 'cry', 'heart', 'behalf', 'suffering', 'citizenry.It', 'understanding', 'too', 'sleek', 'Jaguar', 'agent', 'McCall', 'town', 'sparked', 'wave', 'buying', 'marque', 'show', 'took', 'hold', 'much', 'better', 'buy', 'today', 'model.However', 'digress', 'stories', 'are', 'excellent', 'remind', 'situations', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'acting', 'plots', 'are', 'generally', 'extremely', 'high', 'standard', 'main', 'personally', 'find', 'stories', 'involving', 'son', 'more', 'little', 'tedious', 'excellent', 'addition', 'anyone', 'collection', 'Hopefully', 'powers', 'be', 'will', 'see', 'fit', 'add', 'Callan', 'future', 'release', 'list']",The Equalizer: Season One
1119629,A3FY3H6F4249E0,B000YENUOK,Kathy W,"[2, 2]","5 Disc DVD set.  Crystal clear picture.  The Equalizer is a classy suit and tie guy, a British gentleman, who was trained as a spy and was one of the best agents around.  He has all the knowledge and connections he needs to do anything along with vast experience from his years with ""The Company"".  The collection is a 2008 release of a TV series from the 1980""s.  Golden Globe winner Edward Woodward stars as Special Agent Robert McCall, retired and turned into a sort of private detective.  Woodward does an outstanding job as he uses his special secret agent training, experience, and contacts to help those who don't know where else to turn.  As a private citizen, McCall often bends the system to do things the police cannot legally do.  On a mission to ""pay back"" in a special way for his lifetime of killing for the government, he helps those in need, usually for no fee at all.  You get the impression that McCall has acquired so much money over the years that he doesn't need to make any more.1) Pilot: The Equalizer (1  hours?)The Pilot of the TV series takes place primarily on the streets of Manhattan as McCall, recently retired as a Secret Agent from a secret government organization (CIA?), runs a newspaper advertisement to help people in need.  He calls himself ""The Equalizer"" because when the odds are against you, he seeks to ""equalize"" them.  In the pilot, McCall gets involved with a woman being stalked by a fruitcake and a man who finds a secret code at the telecommunications company where he works.  Both are in danger.  The pilot includes a car chase as well as some Manhattan scenery.  You also meet ""Control"" and the Equalizer's son ""Scott"".  A commentary with the show's creator, Michael Sloan, is included.2)  China Rain (approx 50 minutes)In this episode, a 5-year old Chinese boy is kidnapped and McCall is called for help.  This episode introduces character Mickey Klausmeyer, as Mickey and McCall go into the skuzzy parts of Chinatown to rescue the boy.3)  The DefectorMcCall steps in to protect a murdered secret agent's daughter in this episode.  He also helps a young man deal with high-school bullies.4)  The Lock BoxI remember seeing this episode several times before.  A family of 3 goes on vacation to NYC and become quickly dis-enchanted with NY.  Then, the young pretty teenage daughter, 17-year old Edie from Diluth, is kidnapped by 2 men playing good guy/bad guy.  They are seeking to make a plaything out of her for those willing to pay the price.  The police are no help and the mom calls McCall for help.5)  Lady Cop6)  The Confirmation Day7)  The Children's Song8)  The Distant Fire9)  Mama's Boy10)  Bump and Run11)  Desperately12)  Reign of Terror13)  Back Home14)  Out of the Past15)  Dead Drop16)  Wash-Up17)  Torn18)  Unnatural Causes19)  Breakpoint20)  No Conscience21)  Unpunished Crimes22)  Pretenders23)  Beyond ControlThis is a bonus episode from Season Two.",5,Good Guys vs. Bad Guys,1225670400,"11 3, 2008",2008,2918,"['5', 'Disc', 'DVD', 'set', 'Crystal', 'clear', 'picture', 'Equalizer', 'classy', 'suit', 'tie', 'guy', 'British', 'gentleman', 'who', 'was', 'trained', 'spy', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'agents', 'around', 'knowledge', 'connections', 'do', 'anything', 'vast', 'experience', 'years', 'Company', 'collection', '2008', 'release', 'TV', 'series', '1980', 's.', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Edward', 'Woodward', 'Special', 'Agent', 'Robert', 'McCall', 'retired', 'turned', 'sort', 'private', 'detective', 'Woodward', 'outstanding', 'job', 'special', 'secret', 'agent', 'training', 'experience', 'contacts', 'help', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'else', 'turn', 'private', 'citizen', 'McCall', 'often', 'system', 'do', 'things', 'police', 'can', 'not', 'legally', 'do', 'mission', 'pay', 'back', 'special', 'way', 'lifetime', 'killing', 'government', 'need', 'usually', 'fee', 'get', 'impression', 'McCall', 'acquired', 'so', 'much', 'money', 'years', ""n't"", 'need', 'make', 'more.1', 'Pilot', 'Equalizer', '1', 'hours', 'Pilot', 'TV', 'series', 'place', 'primarily', 'streets', 'Manhattan', 'McCall', 'recently', 'retired', 'Secret', 'Agent', 'secret', 'government', 'organization', 'CIA', 'newspaper', 'advertisement', 'help', 'people', 'need', 'Equalizer', 'when', 'odds', 'are', 'equalize', 'pilot', 'McCall', 'involved', 'woman', 'being', 'stalked', 'fruitcake', 'man', 'who', 'secret', 'code', 'telecommunications', 'company', 'where', 'are', 'danger', 'pilot', 'car', 'chase', 'as', 'well', 'Manhattan', 'scenery', 'also', 'meet', 'Control', 'Equalizer', 'son', 'Scott', 'commentary', 'show', 'creator', 'Michael', 'Sloan', 'included.2', 'China', 'Rain', 'approx', '50', 'minutes', 'episode', '5-year', 'old', 'Chinese', 'boy', 'kidnapped', 'McCall', 'called', 'help', 'episode', 'character', 'Mickey', 'Klausmeyer', 'Mickey', 'McCall', 'go', 'skuzzy', 'parts', 'Chinatown', 'rescue', 'boy.3', 'DefectorMcCall', 'steps', 'protect', 'murdered', 'secret', 'agent', 'daughter', 'episode', 'also', 'young', 'man', 'deal', 'high-school', 'bullies.4', 'Lock', 'BoxI', 'remember', 'seeing', 'episode', 'several', 'times', 'before', 'family', '3', 'vacation', 'NYC', 'become', 'quickly', 'dis-enchanted', 'NY', 'Then', 'young', 'pretty', 'teenage', 'daughter', '17-year', 'old', 'Edie', 'Diluth', 'kidnapped', '2', 'men', 'playing', 'good', 'guy/bad', 'guy', 'are', 'seeking', 'make', 'plaything', 'willing', 'pay', 'price', 'police', 'are', 'help', 'mom', 'McCall', 'help.5', 'Lady', 'Cop6', 'Confirmation', 'Day7', 'Children', 'Song8', 'Distant', 'Fire9', 'Mama', 'Boy10', 'Bump', 'Run11', 'Desperately12', 'Reign', 'Terror13', 'Back', 'Home14', 'Past15', 'Dead', 'Drop16', 'Wash-Up17', 'Torn18', 'Unnatural', 'Causes19', 'Breakpoint20', 'No', 'Conscience21', 'Unpunished', 'Crimes22', 'Pretenders23', 'Beyond', 'ControlThis', 'bonus', 'episode', 'Season', 'Two']",The Equalizer: Season One
1119630,A2J8EP1KVG0F1A,B000YENUOK,Lanternattic,"[0, 0]","One of the best TV series ever made.  It's a shame it was only on for four seasons, but wow...............those seasons.  I just heard that the long-awaited ""The Equalizer"" movie will be out in 2014, directed by Antoine Fuqua and staring Denzel Washington.  The sneak peaks at the teasers look like it's probably a good film.  However, it shifts to Boston instead of NYC and Washington, while one of the greatest actors ever, will have large shoes to fill to play Robert McCall.  Edward Woodward was absolutely supurb in the role.  ""The Equalizer"" prefered to use brain over brawn most times and use elaborate ruses and schemes to manipulate the bad guys into deep-sixing themselves.  However, Robert McCall never hesitated to use violence if the situation called for it.  The bad guys always under estimated McCall..........that was his strength. The bad guys never knew what hit them until it was way too late!The one complaint is against UNIVERSAL, not this series.  Season 1 was released in 2008 and then NOTHING.....for six years.  Then we find out Season two will be out in 2014 but from another studio that purchased the rights to the DVD releases?  Perhaps that's just as well, because Season one, while quite excellent in content, is flawed in the execution.  The transfer to DVD was very sloppy and the video / audio quality not very good.  Universal should be ashamed of themselves for not giving this excellent series the attention it deserves.  We can only hope that the new studio that owns the rights does a better job on Seasons 2,3 and 4.  My hope is that new digital masters will be made to soup up the video quality.  The only season that was in stereo was Season 4, so maybe the audio will at least be better on that one.  One can only wonder WHY this series was not released on CBS/Paramount home video, since this was in fact a CBS series?  Universal Studios certainly didn't do ""The Equalizer"" any favors.However................SOMETHING for Season 1 is better than nothing, so on that basis, I'd recommend it!

Edward Woodward the star of the show might not seem like a typical super hero type today as compared to say Jim Caviezel in the now current show &#34;Person of Interest&#34;, but, both have their own appeal and Interest as far as actors in very similar situations, only much different time periods.  I like them both as TV shows go, but having lived through the 80's I like the step back to a lesser high tech society than we have now which borders on Orwellian predictions in the novel &#34;1984&#34;. We now live the 80's or future time depicted in the novel and the real 80's was a bit tame in high tech comparison, although it is interesting to see how things were done in the super sleuth crime stopper world then as compared to now.

1119644,A3LXKO2S6G2DBI,B000YENUOK,"Stephen Kaczmarek ""Educator, Writer, Consultant""","[5, 5]","Despite all the buzz in those days, the 80s were not a particularly great time for TV. For every ""St. Elsewhere,"" ""Hill Street Blues,"" or ""LA Law,"" there was a ""Manimal, ""Beverly Hills Buntz,"" or ""Full House.""  If the 70s was mostly fluff like ""Charlie's Angels,"" the 80s was that same fluff with a bloated budget and on coke.Not ""The Equalizer."" Hard hitting and generally uncompromising in its approach -- in the pilot, hero Robert McCall promises a stalker in no uncertain terms he will kill him if the stalker does not leave his client alone -- it was an atmospheric, effective series about a conscience-addled spy trying to do right after a lifetime of dirty deeds. Britain's own Callan, Edward Woodward, is the embodiment of McCall, a flawed hero that is one part anger, one part class, and one part mercenary, but all guardian angel, only with his halo tarnished and very, very heavy.The first season is the best, when Woodward, before suffering a heart attack, was a coiled, gray-haired avenger, capable of holding his own during the inevitable chase and fight scenes, despite having Michael Caine's gait, glasses, and accent. Where Woodward shines, however, is in any scene involving emotions, bursting and otherwise, and to watch his McCall explode into anger one moment but be reduced to absolute subtlety the next is to see an actor in his element. Indeed, though the scripts were often first-rate, Woodward could imbue them with more than the words themselves probably merited, which isn't to say that not unlike William Shatner, he didn't sometimes find himself being more theatrical than necessary.""The Equalizer"" was also shot mostly on location, with a cinematic camera style and muted cinematography that made New York even in summertime look as yellow and gritty as Normandy Beach would a decade later in Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan."" Kudos especially to Richard Compton for the terrific directing. Stand out episodes include my personal favorite, China Rain, Lady Cop, Lock Box, Bump and Run, Reign of Terror, Desperately, Distant Fire, and Dead Drop (particularly the final scene with Saul Rubinek, the Yuppie boss putting the screws to McCall's friend, Control), but all are winners. The supporting cast, including Robert Lansing, Keith Szarabajka, Mark Margolis, and William Zabka, as McCall's estranged son, are great, and look for a host of notable guest stars -- I won't spoil it for you because you'll probably be amazed at how this show attracted top talent.Stewart Copeland's score, which combines a drummy, electronic underpinning with an almost delightful Irish-sounding ditty that is The Equalizer's theme, is used to maximum effect, both in the suitably menacing credits sequence and as incidental music throughout the series.  (The aforementioned China Rain makes maximum use of it during the climax.)  And, finally, McCall had the best trappings -- clothes, apartment, and car, a sleek, black Jaguar with a mobile phone.  In the decade before even five-year-olds had flip phones, that alone was a pretty good setup.",5,Quite Probably the Best Underrated 80s Series,1242518400,"05 17, 2009",2009,3055,"['buzz', 'days', '80s', 'were', 'not', 'particularly', 'great', 'time', 'TV', 'St', 'Elsewhere', 'Hill', 'Street', 'Blues', 'LA', 'Law', 'was', 'Manimal', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'Buntz', 'Full', 'House', '70s', 'was', 'mostly', 'fluff', 'Charlie', 'Angels', '80s', 'was', 'same', 'fluff', 'bloated', 'budget', 'coke.Not', 'Equalizer', 'Hard', 'hitting', 'generally', 'uncompromising', 'approach', 'pilot', 'hero', 'Robert', 'McCall', 'stalker', 'uncertain', 'terms', 'will', 'kill', 'stalker', 'not', 'leave', 'client', 'alone', 'was', 'atmospheric', 'effective', 'series', 'conscience-addled', 'spy', 'trying', 'do', 'right', 'lifetime', 'dirty', 'deeds', 'Britain', 'own', 'Callan', 'Edward', 'Woodward', 'embodiment', 'McCall', 'flawed', 'hero', 'one', 'part', 'anger', 'one', 'part', 'class', 'one', 'part', 'mercenary', 'guardian', 'angel', 'only', 'halo', 'tarnished', 'very', 'very', 'heavy.The', 'first', 'season', 'best', 'when', 'Woodward', 'suffering', 'heart', 'attack', 'was', 'coiled', 'gray-haired', 'avenger', 'capable', 'holding', 'own', 'inevitable', 'chase', 'fight', 'scenes', 'having', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'gait', 'glasses', 'accent', 'Where', 'Woodward', 'however', 'scene', 'involving', 'emotions', 'bursting', 'otherwise', 'watch', 'McCall', 'explode', 'anger', 'one', 'moment', 'be', 'reduced', 'absolute', 'subtlety', 'next', 'see', 'actor', 'element', 'Indeed', 'scripts', 'were', 'often', 'first-rate', 'Woodward', 'could', 'imbue', 'more', 'words', 'probably', 'merited', ""n't"", 'say', 'not', 'William', 'Shatner', 'did', ""n't"", 'sometimes', 'find', 'being', 'more', 'theatrical', 'necessary', 'Equalizer', 'was', 'also', 'shot', 'mostly', 'location', 'cinematic', 'camera', 'style', 'muted', 'cinematography', 'made', 'New', 'York', 'even', 'summertime', 'look', 'yellow', 'gritty', 'Normandy', 'Beach', 'would', 'decade', 'later', 'Spielberg', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'Kudos', 'especially', 'Richard', 'Compton', 'terrific', 'directing', 'Stand', 'out', 'episodes', 'include', 'personal', 'favorite', 'China', 'Rain', 'Lady', 'Cop', 'Lock', 'Box', 'Bump', 'Run', 'Reign', 'Terror', 'Desperately', 'Distant', 'Fire', 'Dead', 'Drop', 'particularly', 'final', 'scene', 'Saul', 'Rubinek', 'Yuppie', 'boss', 'putting', 'screws', 'McCall', 'friend', 'Control', 'are', 'winners', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Robert', 'Lansing', 'Keith', 'Szarabajka', 'Mark', 'Margolis', 'William', 'Zabka', 'McCall', 'estranged', 'son', 'are', 'great', 'look', 'host', 'notable', 'guest', 'stars', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'amazed', 'how', 'show', 'attracted', 'top', 'talent.Stewart', 'Copeland', 'score', 'drummy', 'electronic', 'underpinning', 'almost', 'delightful', 'Irish-sounding', 'ditty', 'Equalizer', 'theme', 'used', 'maximum', 'effect', 'suitably', 'menacing', 'credits', 'sequence', 'incidental', 'music', 'series', 'aforementioned', 'China', 'Rain', 'maximum', 'use', 'climax', 'finally', 'McCall', 'had', 'best', 'trappings', 'clothes', 'apartment', 'car', 'sleek', 'black', 'Jaguar', 'mobile', 'phone', 'decade', 'even', 'five-year-olds', 'had', 'flip', 'phones', 'alone', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'setup']",The Equalizer: Season One

The series centers around ex-special agent Robert McCall.  McCall is weary of the treacherous nature of the espionage business and decides to offer his services to average people in trouble who need the odds equalized.  McCall puts an ad in a paper.  As he assists the average New Yorker, he also has to deal with the local authoraties and former colleagues, some of whom he is out of favor with due to his defection from his career.The first episode has a commentary option from producer creator Jon Sloan. I'm usually not much for dvd commentaries, but I enjoyed the insights in this one - behind the scenes facts of filming the show in New York City and the fact that the network really wanted Robert Loggia or Robert Culp to portray McCall.I really can't think of another actor as The Equalizer.  Woodward gives McCall a charisma.  McCall is an agent that is damn good at what he does but far from infallible.  There's a human element quite present in McCall as he attempts to mend his relationship with his son who resents a formerly absent father.I've enjoyed a lot of Edward Woodward's roles - he was great in the Australian movie, Breaker Morant.  Woodward deserves a lot of credit, he is the show's sole star throughtout the series run.  There are many memorable re-occuring characters.  While I would classify the show as a drama, there certainly are elements of action and suspense throughout the episodes.The show makes great use of New York as a back drop.  The city exudes urban paranoia as well as a sense of the wonderful perks of life in the big city.Another plus in the mix of The Equalizer is its soundtrack from former Police band member Stewart Copeland.  The music is a thriving force within the show, adding an edge of excitement and mood.I distinctly remember my enthusiasim at the start of each new show, commencing with the series' memorable theme and opening montage of scenes.
