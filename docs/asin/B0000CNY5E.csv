For whatever reason it struck a chord with me.  I bought this at a store that was liquidating it's stock and it intrigued me.  Maybe it has something to do with my affinity for star David Johansen.  I was fortunate to see him live four times in both his Buster Poindexter persona and the latest incarnation of the New York Dolls.  Johansen brings the same manic energy to ""Car 54"" that he brought to his music performances.  Johansen also impressed me in his other prominent screen efforts, ""Scrooged"" and ""Let it Ride"".  Also, how can you go wrong with a deliciously eclectic cast that includes John C. McGinley, Jeremy Piven, Fran Drescher, Nipsey Russell, and ""Grampa"" Al Lewis.  Even the odious Rosie O'Donnell couldn't ruin the flick for me.  The movie is not so much funny but goofy in a surreal kind of way.  It owes itself more to the ""Police Academy"" or ""Naked Gun"" movies than the original TV series.  I loved this movie so shoot me.",5,I Loved It.
