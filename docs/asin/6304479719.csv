It has many funny scenes and lines, and shows Elvis's natural flair for comedy that was seldom utilized in his movies. Sometimes this film is criticized for portraying the central characters as sterotyped southern bumpkins, yet I believe this is negated by the fact that they outsmart all their enemies to triumph in the end. And it's all done with playful humor anyway.All the cast is good, with standouts being Elvis, Arthur O'Connell as Elvis's amusingly daffy father, and Simon Oakland as the mafioso that is outsmarted at every move. The few songs are decent, though none is terrific, and mostly contribute to the film; the title song and ""Angel"" are the best of these. Gordon Douglas directs the movie well, and he is the only person to have directed both Elvis and Frank Sinatra. Note that the film is available in both standard and widescreen formats.

424510,A3MGJVPJBNPSEJ,6304479719,Blahblahblah,"[5, 5]","There are only three Elvis films that I enjoy: King Creole, Jailhouse Rock, and Follow That Dream.  While the first two are great musical dramas from when Elvis still had the air of rebellion about him, Follow That Dream is a piece of comedic fluff like most of his later films, but one which avoids being as formulaic or sickly sweet or filled with terrible music as are most of those later films.In this one Elvis plays a true innocent who is somehow still ignorant about the ways of the world despite being a vet.  He and his family (including some orphans they are looking after) build a homestead on government land which happens to be prime real estate and find themselves in the position to legally obtain ownership of this land.  As a result they become the targets of organized crime and feds (who can tell them apart?) who want the land.  Elvis also finds himself the target of a crackpot social worker looking into the welfare of the orphans who seeks revenge after he innocently spurns her advances.  Elvis gives a really fun performance as a naive character who is so positive in his outlook that when somebody shoots at him he automatically assumes it was an error.The film pokes great fun at bureaucracy and greed, but it maintains the optimistic outlook that good guys will win in the end.  Such an innocent perspective tends to turn off many fans of social satire who find such things too escapist, but what most cynical viewers miss is that much of the innocence is tongue in cheek, and I personally see nothing wrong with optimism so long as it doesn't interfere with realism.

424512,A25UZ7MA72SMKM,6304479719,Brent Butler,"[3, 3]","In ""Follow that Dream"", Elvis stands out as a somewhat simple-minded, somewhat naive, but incredibly honest GI who was retired on disability. Arthur O'Connell is hilarious as his father, who likes to help out the government as much as possible by taking all the money they will offer him.Along with the father and son are a variety of foundlings that the father took in over the years. On a trip through Florida, they run out of gas and homestead a stretch of beach. A local banker who likes the fishing loans them the money to set up a fishing operation off of their beach, while at the same time a trailer load of gambling gangsters set up shop when they discover that the unincorporated area is a little hole in local law enforcement. A local social worker inserts herself into the picture in an attempt to help shoehorn the family off of their homestead, and makes a play to take the orphans away.Elvis provides great straight-man comedy throughout, constantly misunderstanding situations from the commonplace to the abnormal as he tries to fit them into his narrow experience in the world around him. His adopted sister, Holly, who has less experience but more capacity to catch on to events around her, helps to keep the family from falling face first into the pitfalls placed in their path. Arthur O'Connell constantly expounds ""sage"" advice of a decidedly shaky nature, all of which is amusing.Filmed on location on or near the Gulf Coast in central Florida, the scenery is beautiful. Of course, as an Elvis movie, there are several songs. All are entertaining, and the title song, ""Follow that Dream"", is a real winner.If you've never seen Follow that Dream, you owe yourself the experience of this very entertaining film.

424522,A1QBI8OLOFKQ3N,6304479719,Highlander,"[4, 4]","Follow that Dream is Elvis at his best. A comparatively early musical effort before the King settled into his more formulaic series of musicals. The movie has Elvis as an 'aw shucks, maam' good ole' southern boy.On outside appearances - not too bright but underneath a tough core with a country smart take on things. Elvis is excellent and his screen presence shows why his movies were far more profitable than such mainstream musicals as 'Camelot' and 'Paint Your Wagon'. Elvis wandering the woods singing 'I Talk to the Trees' would have been an enjoyable, silly pleasure and not the toe curling embarassment that Clint Eastwood made of it in the latter film. Obviously Eastwood has transcended all expectations since then but in musical adventure films no one can surpass the King.

Scott as Patton.  Judy Garland as Dorothy Gale.  Bela Lugosi as Dracula.  Clark Gable as Rhett Butler.  Humphrey Bogart as Sam Spade.  Madonna as Evita. Charles Laughton as Captain Bligh. Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond, just to name a few.To that list, I add Elvis Presley as Toby Kwimper.Yes, I know; as an actor Elvis was pretty much a good singer and an okay dancer.  Most of his movie performances are ho-hum, looking back on them decades later.  However, in the case of Follow That Dream the persona of Toby Kwimper, a young man of whom one of the other characters observes, ""His heart is pure and his head is empty and you can't beat that combination,"" is brilliantly portrayed by Elvis, one of the few genuinely good-hearted actors ever to hit Hollywood.Toby Kwimper, an innocent from the swamplands of New Jersey's Pine Barrens, has to deal with all kinds of dangers of modern life that would cause a less optimistic and lucky hero to quail.  The plot is fairly simple.On a trip to Florida to visit relatives, Toby, his Pop (ably played by Arthur O'Connell), his twin kid brothers Teddy and Eddy, his baby sister Ariadne and Holly (Anne Helm), a babysitter who is no kin to him, run out of gas on a state highway not yet open to traffic that Pop had driven down.  Stranded on a coast road, the family group improvises, adapts and overcomes to set up camp with no real equipment by the road on dredge spoil used to fill in the land so the road could be made.  The 'pioneers' are truly on virgin land; it didn't exist a couple of months before and the State did not bother to title it.After a few days of roughing it, feeding themselves and quite well at that on nature's bounty, Civilization and Authority show up in the form of H. Arthur King, the local Highway Superintendent.  He goes bananas at the sight of (to his eyes) a bunch of bums camping beside his newly made highway, climbs on his bureaucratic high horse and orders them out. Pop, however, an expert at dealing with governmental bureaucrats after years spent on various programs like welfare, AFDC, WIC and many others, climbs on his own high horse and refuses to leave, citing an 1820 law about homesteading.  He swears out a statement describing the land parcel, and the family settles in to prove up their land.Not one to give up easily, King sics the local child welfare supervisor and clinical psychologist, Alicia Claypoole, onto the Kwimpers.  The idea is to prove that Pop and Toby aren't fit to raise the kids, threaten them with the removal of the children, and thus force the Kwimpers to flee.  Coincidentally, Alicia has the idea of having Toby jump her bones - except that Toby is so innocently naive he can't tell a pass from a hand-off (although Holly, who has her own cap set for Toby, certainly can).  Toby's bewilderment at Alicia's advances will have consequences later.Toby himself has adventures in the Innocents Abroad vein.  When Holly comes up with the idea of starting a little fishing business, a trip to town by Toby to apply for a small business loan ends up with his being mistaken for a bank robber, with humorous results.  When Alicia tries to subvert the Kwimpers' homesteading by showing Toby how much easier life would be in government housing, he ends up recruiting a retired couple to move out to the Kwimpers' highway bridge and homestead the virign land on the other side of the highway.  And when two gangsters (Simon Oakland and Jack Kruschen) set up next door to the Kwimpers because the land isn't policed by the county or the state - more of King's handiwork - Toby serves as proof that God watches out for children, drunks and fools when by a series of misadventures and just being neighborly he demolishes their casino, wrecks their dock, bankrupts their operation and runs them out of town.The climax of the picture comes when Alicia Claypoole has the twins and Ariadne taken away from Pop on specious psychological grounds, forcing a confrontation in front of a judge who has the power to make the removal permanent.  Once more, it's up to Toby to make things right - if he can.Follow That Dream is taken from Richard Powell's book, Pioneer, Go Home! and thanks to screenwriter Charles Lederer astutely deciding not to monkey with a well-crafted book, hews very closely to the novel.  He also manages to keep the feel of Toby and Pop's speech patterns and most of the book's original dialogue.  Lederer cut only two sequences from the novel.  The first was the hurricane which H. Arthur King hoped to use as a pretext to break the Kwimpers' continuous occupancy of their land as required by the homesteading act, and it is not missed.  The second is the epilogue, and that isn't missed either.  Frankly, he did one of the best jobs of adapting a book to the screen that I have ever seen; and considering the vivisection usually performed on original novels in Hollywood, that is praise indeed.The five songs Elvis sings are nothing special, but that doesn't matter.  In my opinion, this is the one Elvis Presley movie that could stand on its own even if he didn't sing a note.  Nobody is going to mistake Follow That Dream for anything but light entertainment; but entertained you will be, and delightfully so.  As I said, this is the role Elvis Presley was born to play, and he plays it to perfection.",5,The Role Elvis Was Born to Play,1098835200,"10 27, 2004",2004,5450,"['so', 'often', 'actor', 'role',
