The evidence is there.I would like to mention two sources that use undisputed DNA evidence that every human alive today has an ancestor who left East Africa to populate every continent in the world. The first source is Dr. Spencer Wells, who released a DVD in 2003 titled ""Journey of Man"", proving that the first humans were Namibian Bushmen. He even traced the routes they followed based on mutations in paternal DNA. This DVD is available on Amazon.The second source is a book titled ""The Seven Daughters of Eve"" by Bryan Sykes,who is a professor of genetics at Oxford University. The book was published in 2001. He found that all humans alive today are related to seven women who left Africa 150,000 years ago. He used mitochondrial DNA as proof. I bought this book on Amazon.What this means is that we are all Africans. Our ancestors lost their melanin when they arrived in cold countries.The Olmec face that you saw in Mexico could have been African. There are many black faces in Mexico and the Caribbean. To see other similar stone faces, go to the museum in the city of Villahermosa, Mexico, in the state of Chiapas. I have seen them.We are all Africans. There are many other scientific sources that prove that.
