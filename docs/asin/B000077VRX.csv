724899,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B000077VRX,A Customer,"[1, 1]","Summary:Oscar Grubman (Aaron Stanford) is a 15-year old high school sophomore who is deeply interested in literature and has lately been reading Voltaire.  Perhaps in conjunction with or more likely as a result, Oscar has developed a very deep romantic and sexual interest for older women and one woman in particular, his stepmother, Eve Grubman (Sigourney Weaver).  When Oscar comes homes for Thanksgiving with his father and stepmother, Oscar has committed himself to break the news to Eve.  Before he gets a chance, he gets drunk and, imagining Eve's best friend, Diane Lodder (Bebe Neuwirth), to be Eve because she is wearing Eve's scarf, Oscar has sex with her.  Perhaps it wouldn't be a problem except, remember, Oscar is 15 and Diane is over 40 and Eve's best friend.  Now Oscar has to convince his dad, Stanley Grubman (John Ritter), that he is a normal 15 year-old and also explain to Eve why he slept with her best friend when he actually wanted to be sleeping with her.My Comments:I don't know that my summary did the movie justice.  I think I may have made it out to be more malicious than humorous and if that's the case, then you'll just have to see this movie to understand how what might be a seen as disturbing situation is actually a very funny comedy.The story is superb and the acting is pretty good overall.  Bebe Neuwirth and Aaron Stanford are very convincing and Sigourney Weaver is only slightly less so.  The only problems with this movie, and I hate to make this criticism because I really do advocate a change from film to digital, are the picture quality and the cinematography.  I'm guessing the movie was filmed using lower quality digital cameras.  The cameras have a hard time focusing at times and a lot of quick motion turns into blurred motion.  I believe digital is the way of the future, but perhaps the technology for anyone to make a major motion picture using their Circuit City bought digital camera isn't quite there yet.Despite the picture problems, the movie is loads of fun and lots of laughs.  I should also point out that young men sleeping with much older women, in case you haven't already realized this, is going to be very disturbing to some people.  Well, if you find it very, very disturbing, you may want to skip this one.  If you think you can look past that to be entertained by a very enjoyable movie, then you should definitely see this film.",4,Very funny; absolutely loved it.,1050624000,"04 18, 2003",2003,2401,"['Summary', 'Oscar', 'Grubman', 'Aaron', 'Stanford', '15-year', 'old', 'high', 'school', 'sophomore', 'who', 'deeply', 'interested', 'literature', 'lately', 'been', 'reading', 'Voltaire', 'Perhaps', 'conjunction', 'more', 'likely', 'result', 'Oscar', 'developed', 'very', 'deep', 'romantic', 'sexual', 'interest', 'older', 'women', 'one', 'woman', 'particular', 'stepmother', 'Eve', 'Grubman', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'When', 'Oscar', 'homes', 'Thanksgiving', 'father', 'stepmother', 'Oscar', 'committed', 'break', 'news', 'Eve', 'chance', 'drunk', 'imagining', 'Eve', 'best', 'friend', 'Diane', 'Lodder', 'Bebe', 'Neuwirth', 'be', 'Eve', 'wearing', 'Eve', 'scarf', 'Oscar', 'sex', 'Perhaps', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'problem', 'remember', 'Oscar', '15', 'Diane', '40', 'Eve', 'best', 'friend', 'Now', 'Oscar', 'convince', 'dad', 'Stanley', 'Grubman', 'John', 'Ritter', 'normal', '15', 'year-old', 'also', 'explain', 'Eve', 'why', 'slept', 'best', 'friend', 'when', 'actually', 'wanted', 'be', 'sleeping', 'her.My', 'Comments', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'summary', 'did', 'movie', 'justice', 'think', 'may', 'have', 'made', 'be', 'more', 'malicious', 'humorous', 'case', 'then', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'see', 'movie', 'understand', 'how', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'seen', 'disturbing', 'situation', 'actually', 'very', 'funny', 'comedy.The', 'story', 'superb', 'acting', 'pretty', 'good', 'overall', 'Bebe', 'Neuwirth', 'Aaron', 'Stanford', 'are', 'very', 'convincing', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'only', 'slightly', 'less', 'so', 'only', 'problems', 'movie', 'hate', 'make', 'criticism', 'really', 'do', 'advocate', 'change', 'film', 'digital', 'are', 'picture', 'quality', 'cinematography', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'using', 'lower', 'quality', 'digital', 'cameras', 'cameras', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'focusing', 'times', 'lot', 'quick', 'motion', 'blurred', 'motion', 'believe', 'digital', 'way', 'future', 'perhaps', 'technology', 'anyone', 'make', 'major', 'motion', 'picture', 'using', 'Circuit', 'City', 'bought', 'digital', 'camera', ""n't"", 'quite', 'yet.Despite', 'picture', 'problems', 'movie', 'loads', 'fun', 'lots', 'laughs', 'should', 'also', 'point', 'out', 'young', 'men', 'sleeping', 'much', 'older', 'women', 'case', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'realized', 'going', 'be', 'very', 'disturbing', 'people', 'Well', 'find', 'very', 'very', 'disturbing', 'may', 'want', 'skip', 'one', 'think', 'can', 'look', 'past', 'be', 'entertained', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'then', 'should', 'definitely', 'see', 'film']",Tadpole

I enjoyed it very much without actually loving it.  The acting is fine; Sigourney Weaver is as good as ever, John Ritter rings true as the befuddled, academic-minded father, and Bebe Neuwirth is terrific as a more humorous Mrs. Robinson.  As the titular tadpole, Oscar, newcomer Aaron Stanford is sweetly sincere as a passionate, intelligent, and very serious teenage boy in love with his stepmother (Weaver) and seduced by her best friend (Neuwirth).  There's nothing at all wrong with &quot;Tadpole&quot;; it just somehow doesn't have the emotional heft of a great film.",4,The Little Tadpole That Wants To,1048032000,"03 19, 2003",2003,691,"['seventy-seven', 'minutes', 'quot', 'Tadpole', 'quot', 'uncharacteristically', 'short', 'film', 'one', 'full', 'life', 'spirit', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'much', 'actually', 'loving', 'acting', 'fine', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'as', 'good', 'ever', 'John', 'Ritter', 'true', 'befuddled', 'academic-minded', 'father', 'Bebe', 'Neuwirth', 'terrific', 'more', 'humorous', 'Mrs.', 'Robinson', 'titular', 'tadpole', 'Oscar', 'newcomer', 'Aaron', 'Stanford', 'sweetly', 'sincere', 'passionate', 'intelligent', 'very', 'serious', 'teenage', 'boy', 'love', 'stepmother', 'Weaver', 'seduced', 'best', 'friend', 'Neuwirth', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'quot', 'Tadpole', 'quot', 'just', 'somehow', ""n't"", 'have', 'emotional', 'heft', 'great', 'film']",Tadpole
724901,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000077VRX,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","There is something about `Tadpole' that is so nerdy charming I can't help but recall it with affectionate memories.  It is far from perfect, and yet the little imperfections that plague it only seem to make it better for me.  It's not the type of wildly engaging comedy that can be watched over and over again but it is the type of smartly comedic film that you will remember for a long while, even after a solitary viewing.Watching the film on a total whim, I was surprised by how witty and devilishly sophisticated it wound up being.The film tells the story of Oscar, a young man with quite the conundrum.  He is, unfortunately, in love with his step-mother Eve.  The fact that Eve is married to Oscar's father really doesn't deter him much from attempting to make his feelings known.  He takes the Thanksgiving break (and subsequent visit home from school) to find a way to expose his feelings only to have romantic entanglements get in the way.  Before he knows it he is being followed (quite accidentally) by a fellow schoolmate with a crush, pushed on a neighbor with which he shares no interest and thrust into sexual debauchery with Eve's best friend, Diane.  All of these `road-blocks' make it more and more difficult for Oscar to just tell Eve how he feels.But then again, does it really matter?The cast is flawless, especially Bebe Neuwirth who just sizzles in every scene with comedic delights and snarky charm that just floods the screen.  She is a star and the star of this film whenever the light is cast her way.  Sigourney Weaver is a tad frumpy here, but I think that was the point (casting a more mature light on Oscar's infatuation) and the late John Ritter is certainly up to the task and making his character shine.  Aaron Stanford understands the muted arrogance needed to create Oscar and keep the audience interested in him.  He rides the cuff of unlikable and engaging, which helps carry the film.Sadly, the strengths of the script and cast seem to fall through the directors hands.  The film needed some crisper, more attentive direction that could have really embellished the already strong material.  Instead, the muted brushstrokes of Gary Winick (the man behind '13 Going on 30' and `Bride Wars') can create a dullish tone to the film.  Hey, this is Winick's best film to date, but it may be his least imaginative directorial effort.Still, this is a must see; a film I highly recommend!",4,Fast swimmer...,1296604800,"02 2, 2011",2011,2417,"['something', 'Tadpole', 'so', 'nerdy', 'charming', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'recall', 'affectionate', 'memories', 'far', 'perfect', 'yet', 'little', 'imperfections', 'plague', 'only', 'seem', 'make', 'better', 'not', 'type', 'wildly', 'engaging', 'comedy', 'can', 'be', 'watched', 'over', 'again', 'type', 'smartly', 'comedic', 'film', 'will', 'remember', 'long', 'while', 'even', 'solitary', 'viewing.Watching', 'film', 'total', 'whim', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'witty', 'devilishly', 'sophisticated', 'wound', 'up', 'being.The', 'film', 'story', 'Oscar', 'young', 'man', 'conundrum', 'unfortunately', 'love', 'step-mother', 'Eve', 'fact', 'Eve', 'married', 'Oscar', 'father', 'really', ""n't"", 'deter', 'much', 'attempting', 'make', 'feelings', 'known', 'Thanksgiving', 'break', 'subsequent', 'visit', 'home', 'school', 'find', 'way', 'expose', 'feelings', 'only', 'have', 'romantic', 'entanglements', 'get', 'way', 'being', 'followed', 'quite', 'accidentally', 'fellow', 'schoolmate', 'crush', 'pushed', 'neighbor', 'shares', 'interest', 'thrust', 'sexual', 'debauchery', 'Eve', 'best', 'friend', 'Diane', 'road-blocks', 'make', 'more', 'more', 'difficult', 'Oscar', 'just', 'tell', 'Eve', 'how', 'feels.But', 'then', 'again', 'really', 'matter', 'cast', 'flawless', 'especially', 'Bebe', 'Neuwirth', 'who', 'just', 'sizzles', 'scene', 'comedic', 'delights', 'snarky', 'charm', 'just', 'screen', 'star', 'star', 'film', 'whenever', 'light', 'cast', 'way', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'tad', 'frumpy', 'here', 'think', 'was', 'point', 'casting', 'more', 'mature', 'light', 'Oscar', 'infatuation', 'late', 'John', 'Ritter', 'certainly', 'up', 'task', 'making', 'character', 'shine', 'Aaron', 'Stanford', 'muted', 'arrogance', 'needed', 'create', 'Oscar', 'keep', 'audience', 'interested', 'cuff', 'unlikable', 'engaging', 'carry', 'film.Sadly', 'strengths', 'script', 'cast', 'seem', 'fall', 'directors', 'hands', 'film', 'needed', 'crisper', 'more', 'attentive', 'direction', 'could', 'have', 'really', 'embellished', 'already', 'strong', 'material', 'Instead', 'muted', 'brushstrokes', 'Gary', 'Winick', 'man', ""'13"", 'Going', '30', 'Wars', 'can', 'create', 'dullish', 'tone', 'film', 'Hey', 'Winick', 'best', 'film', 'date', 'may', 'be', 'least', 'imaginative', 'directorial', 'effort.Still', 'must', 'see', 'film', 'highly', 'recommend']",Tadpole
724902,A1EI65WJC85U68,B000077VRX,"BD Ashley ""vidiot_y2k""","[2, 2]","This enjoyable comedy (shot on digital video) with a refreshingly brief running time (approx 75 minutes) won Writer/Director Gary Winick the Best Director award at the Sundance Festival.Aaron Stanford plays Oscar Grubman (nicknamed Tadpole), a 15 year old who has no interest in girls his own age.  By his own admission he feels like a 40 year old trapped in a teen's body.  Tadpole's preference for older women reaches the point of chaos when he develop a crush on his stunning stepmother Eve (Sigourney Weaver).But his attentions are also focused on the equalling sexy Diane (Bebe Neuwirth) whom he meets during an under-aged drinking session in a local bar.  An affair soon starts between them and Oscar must try and keep the romance secret from his Dad (the late John Ritter) while wrestling with his feelings for Eve.Basically TADPOLE is a romantic comedy that merges the classic romantic triangle with a dash of the classic Oedipus syndrome.  The resulting movie is an enjoyable time-killer that manages to be both light in tone but with more complexity below the surface than you would expect. While it sounds like some sex comedy you've seen a million times before TADPOLE manages to consistently surprise the viewer without insulting their intelligence (obviously this is an independent movie).This is one of those rare movies that will appeal to just about any audience.  Guys are especially advised to rent this if their girlfriends want them to watch something with them.  The brief running time you may be able to talk her into watching an action movie after this has finished!  While not hugely memorable, the movie has heart, sincerity and intelligence (Uh-oh! Here comes my feminine side!) as well as all round good performances.  The DVD I watched had no special features, but the movie is still worth a look.  If you're a romantic comedy buff you'll easily give this movie a higher rating than the three stars I've given it.  Which leads us to THE BIG QUESTION: Why is Oscar nicknamed ""Tadpole""?  Do the math: One 15 year old boy with raging hormones plus two sexy older women.  Put that together and close your eyes.  What do you see?  I see the opening credits to LOOK WHO'S TALKING....Perhaps I'd be wise to stop my review here.  Maybe this IS meant to be a movie to watch with the missus! If that's the case insert this into your DVD player, pop some popcorn, pop some Viagra and Bob's your uncle.  Viola!

724903,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000077VRX,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","I really don't believe Tadpole is a comedy, unless there's a subtle dark or serious element of humor underneath the entire plot.It's about a super intelligent teenage boy who doesn't have any interest in girls his own age, but rather, women in their 40's. The dilemma he's going through is that he's attracted to two middle aged women at the same time, and the storyline is based around which one he wants to be with more. Personally I would have gone with the brunette back massager, lol.Throughout the movie, there's a noticeable vibe of unusualness concerning the decisions the boy makes. You'll know what I mean when you watch the movie- everything's suspiciously quiet, like a lingering feeling that you're not supposed to fall in love with someone more than twice your age.  This vibe is the reason I fail to see a comedic style appeal.None of this really qualifies as humor from my point of view, but perhaps others would disagree. I wasn't laughing with one exception- a dinner table scene involving his father (John Ritter's character) and the two women the boy's attracted to sitting together at the table with him, leading to a few frustrating and embarrassing scenes.Overall, it's an alright movie, but at only 70 minutes, it should have been longer because as it is, it feels like a film that was never given the proper amount of attention it deserved.",3,not funny but offbeat,1310947200,"07 18, 2011",2011,1365,"['really', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Tadpole', 'comedy', 'subtle', 'dark', 'serious', 'element', 'humor', 'entire', 'plot.It', 'super', 'intelligent', 'teenage', 'boy', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'interest', 'girls', 'own', 'age', 'rather', 'women', '40', 'dilemma', 'going', 'attracted', 'two', 'middle', 'aged', 'women', 'same', 'time', 'storyline', 'based', 'one', 'be', 'more', 'Personally', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'brunette', 'back', 'massager', 'movie', 'noticeable', 'vibe', 'unusualness', 'concerning', 'decisions', 'boy', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'when', 'watch', 'movie-', 'everything', 'suspiciously', 'quiet', 'lingering', 'feeling', ""'re"", 'not', 'supposed', 'fall', 'love', 'someone', 'more', 'twice', 'age', 'vibe', 'reason', 'fail', 'see', 'comedic', 'style', 'appeal.None', 'really', 'humor', 'point', 'view', 'perhaps', 'others', 'would', 'disagree', 'was', ""n't"", 'laughing', 'one', 'exception-', 'dinner', 'table', 'scene', 'involving', 'father', 'John', 'Ritter', 'character', 'two', 'women', 'boy', 'attracted', 'sitting', 'together', 'table', 'leading', 'few', 'frustrating', 'embarrassing', 'scenes.Overall', 'alright', 'movie', 'only', '70', 'minutes', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'longer', 'film', 'was', 'never', 'given', 'proper', 'amount', 'attention', 'deserved']",Tadpole

The kid's eagerness to apply his knowledge to everything that could happen in a Thanksgiving weekend is challenged by the movie's knack for putting him in situations that he never expected.  The literary side of this movie is the thoughts of Voltaire in quoted sentences that show up on the screen more often than I expected.  The funniest thing about Voltaire is that anybody can read this stuff, but no one ever expects it to pop up like this.  Everything this movie says about sideburns is funny.

Oscar, a precocious fifteen year old prep school student who quotes Voltaire and speaks French, is far, far too sophisticated to be bothered by the girls his age. Rather, his heart is focused on his step-mother, played by Sigourney Weaver.  He is a charmer, but completely unable to see the naivete of his youth.  His efforts to be adult -- gluing on fake sideburns and spouting philosophy to any willing audience are right on.  He seems to think that there is no reason he cannot be a serious contender for his step-mother's affections, and he courts her (his true intentions unbeknownst to her) by bringing her lunch at work, calling the terminology of her work (cardiological research) poetry, and playing tennis with her.

The premise is intriguing with a cast - Sigourney Weaver, John Ritter, Bebe Neuwirth - guaranteed to provide real acting, although young Aaron Stanford easily steals the show (Bebe gives him a good run for the money though). The script is articulate and witty (quite rare qualities these days) and intelligence is displayed in all other departments. Apart from Bebe Neuwirth's vampish turns, it is not a laugh out loud comedy - but you find yourself smiling a lot while watching it.My wife and I repeatedly commented during the film about how much it reminded us of one of Francois Truffaut's films - particularly the Antoine Doinel stories. The similarities between Oscar and Antoine are truly striking and the overall French flavour of the piece is surely not accidental. Other reviewers have complained about the directorial style and look of Tadpole, but this a large part of its charm.

I found it to be surprisingly full of life, despite a slow-pace and average story. It's part comedy and part drama, witty and sensitively played, often amusing, but not entirely engaging.  The story is pretty basic; a teenage boy lusts after his stepmother... the plot has been done before... at least, this one is worth the effort to watch.  Aaron Stanford plays Oscar, a very bright 15-year-old with an upper-class background. John Ritter plays Stanley, Oscar's divorced father. Sigourney Weaver plays Eve, Oscar's new stepmother. Bebe Neuwirth plays Diane, a family friend. Oscar (Stanford) develops an immediate crush on his stepmother (Weaver) from the moment she enters his father's life. He struggles with his feelings through most of the movie... eventually engaging in a torrid, but reluctant affair with Diane (Neuwirth) - a woman who is about the same age as Eve - at least thirty years his senior. Perhaps his attraction to Diane is a general attraction to older women, or perhaps he uses Diane in place of the intimacy he cannot have with Eve. The movie does not address that issue, it's just an analysis I would like to see explored. I won't spoil the ending by telling what happens between Oscar and Eve. John Ritter gives a fine performance as the father. Sigourney Weaver is classy and strong in her performance, as always. Bebe Neuwirth is a sensual dynamo and adds comic relief in her performance. And Aaron Stanford carries the movie well in a standout performance.

The film has nothing directly to do with politics, but inadvertently it reminds one why the Democrats were crushed last Tuesday.  Aaron Stanford aptly portrays fifteen year old Oscar Grubman, the son of a Columbia University historian (the late John Ritter) and stepson of a heart disease researcher (Signourney Weaver).  This is an liberal elitist family living in Manhattan.  Needless to add, their nonchalant attitudes toward sexuality, especially pertaining to older adults enjoying sex with young teenagers is considered disgraceful by the majority of citizens living in the red states.We observe the precocious Oscar wrestling (often in French) with his existential and romantic challenges.  Eventually he beds a woman in her forties (Bebe Neuwrath).  This event is not reported to the police.  On the contrary, nobody wishes to be judgmental. A teenage boy is supposedly nature enough to enter into such relationships.  The United States is indeed split apart by a cultural war. Red and blue staters are barely able to comprehend the world view of each other.  Tadpole will remind you just how serious are the differences.

Aaron Stanford is no Dustin Hoffman but is more than up to the role, portraying the super-bright, gawky teenager very adroitly.

724912,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000077VRX,Ed Uyeshima,"[3, 4]","Shot in less than two weeks on digital video, this charming, lightweight 2002 comedy indeed has the murky look of a home movie complete with shaky camera shots and orange-tinted graininess. If you can overlook that, you will see some smart performances by an unusually high-profile cast and clever writing by Heather McGowan & Niels Mueller in this coming-of-age concoction from director Gary Winick. The plot focuses on Oscar Grubman, a Voltaire-quoting fifteen year old who overanalyzes the world around him like a pubescent Woody Allen, so naturally he is not interested in girls his own age but his attractive stepmother Eve, a medical researcher who can wax poetically about the heart. However, things get even more complicated when he falls into a drunken one-night stand with Eve's best friend, Diane, a free-spirited massage therapist who doesn't come across so much as a hedonist but rather sensible about the ways of love. Naturally Oscar's father Stanley is completely ignorant of what's going on, as is Eve until Oscar confesses his love for her.At a running time of only 77 minutes, this all speeds by quickly thanks to Winick's overly efficient pacing, and except for Oscar, the characters aren't given much time to be fully drawn out. Aaron Stanford, a 25-year old playing a decade younger, portrays Oscar expertly, updating a younger version of Benjamin Braddock from ""The Graduate"" for the new millennium. And fortunately, Winick recruited the still-luminous Sigourney Weaver as Eve, as she plays her role with a deadpan sincerity befitting the preoccupied stepmother. The late John Ritter plays Stanley without condescending to his befuddled character, but the best performance comes from Bebe Neuwirth, sexy and frisky as Diane. The restaurant scene with the four of them dodging and ultimately discovering the truth of Oscar and Diane's tryst is very well-played out with Neuwirth particularly funny in her insouciance. Even Robert Iler, Tony Jr. from ""The Sopranos"", shows up as Oscar's best friend Charlie, whose down-to-earth doofus provides a nice contrast to Oscar's often pretentious intellect. This is hardly a cinematic milestone, and frankly it makes a case for using the digital video medium sparingly. But it does provide quiet laughs and insightful if rather predictable observations.",3,"Amusing Coming-of-Age Pre-""Graduate"" Made on the Cheap",1117238400,"05 28, 2005",2005,2316,"['Shot', 'less', 'two', 'weeks', 'digital', 'video', 'charming', 'lightweight', '2002', 'comedy', 'indeed', 'murky', 'look', 'home', 'movie', 'complete', 'shaky', 'camera', 'shots', 'orange-tinted', 'graininess', 'can', 'overlook', 'will', 'see', 'smart', 'performances', 'unusually', 'high-profile', 'cast', 'clever', 'writing', 'Heather', 'McGowan', 'Niels', 'Mueller', 'coming-of-age', 'concoction', 'director', 'Gary', 'Winick', 'plot', 'Oscar', 'Grubman', 'Voltaire-quoting', 'fifteen', 'year', 'old', 'who', 'world', 'pubescent', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'so', 'naturally', 'not', 'interested', 'girls', 'own', 'age', 'attractive', 'stepmother', 'Eve', 'medical', 'researcher', 'who', 'can', 'wax', 'poetically', 'heart', 'However', 'things', 'get', 'even', 'more', 'complicated', 'when', 'drunken', 'one-night', 'stand', 'Eve', 'best', 'friend', 'Diane', 'free-spirited', 'massage', 'therapist', 'who', ""n't"", 'come', 'so', 'much', 'hedonist', 'rather', 'sensible', 'ways', 'love', 'Naturally', 'Oscar', 'father', 'Stanley', 'completely', 'ignorant', 'what', 'going', 'Eve', 'Oscar', 'love', 'her.At', 'running', 'time', 'only', '77', 'minutes', 'speeds', 'quickly', 'thanks', 'Winick', 'overly', 'efficient', 'pacing', 'Oscar', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'given', 'much', 'time', 'be', 'fully', 'drawn', 'out', 'Aaron', 'Stanford', '25-year', 'old', 'playing', 'decade', 'younger', 'Oscar', 'expertly', 'updating', 'younger', 'version', 'Benjamin', 'Braddock', 'Graduate', 'new', 'millennium', 'fortunately', 'Winick', 'recruited', 'still-luminous', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'Eve', 'role', 'deadpan', 'sincerity', 'befitting', 'preoccupied', 'stepmother', 'late', 'John', 'Ritter', 'Stanley', 'condescending', 'befuddled', 'character', 'best', 'performance', 'Bebe', 'Neuwirth', 'sexy', 'frisky', 'Diane', 'restaurant', 'scene', 'four', 'dodging', 'ultimately', 'discovering', 'truth', 'Oscar', 'Diane', 'tryst', 'very', 'well-played', 'Neuwirth', 'particularly', 'funny', 'insouciance', 'Even', 'Robert', 'Iler', 'Tony', 'Jr.', 'Sopranos', 'up', 'Oscar', 'best', 'friend', 'Charlie', 'down-to-earth', 'doofus', 'nice', 'contrast', 'Oscar', 'often', 'pretentious', 'intellect', 'hardly', 'cinematic', 'milestone', 'frankly', 'case', 'using', 'digital', 'video', 'medium', 'sparingly', 'provide', 'quiet', 'laughs', 'insightful', 'rather', 'predictable', 'observations']",Tadpole

Perhaps I should have read more of the French philosophers.Aaron Stanford has his debut acting role as Oscar Grubman, a 15-year-old boarding school student returning to his father's NYC home for the Thanksgiving holiday. Oscar's (divorced) mother is French, so he speaks the language and is heavily into French literature, especially Voltaire. Oscar isn't interested in girls his own age, and a peer remarks that Oscar is a  40-year-old trapped in a teenager's body. Oscar carries a heavy weight - he's got a serious crush on his 40-something stepmom, Eve (Sigourney Weaver). Though Oscar has eyes only for Mrs. Grubman, his mental maturity combined with boyish enthusiasm attracts Eve's female friends, who press their phone numbers on him - and more. Eve's best friend, Diane (Bebe Neuwirth), seduces him one evening after finding him wandering drunk and lovesick (for Eve) on the street. The morning after, Oscar is horrified.This was Stanford's first role after graduating from Rutgers University where he studied theater. Simply put, he's terrific. Neuwirth is positively delicious as the mischievous Diane who toys with the lad as a cat with a mouse. (Any teenage boy should be so lucky!) There's one scene after Oscar's one-night tryst where Oscar, Diane, Eve, and Oscar's father Stanley (John Ritter) go out to a restaurant dinner, and which had the audience almost rolling in the aisles. It alone was worth the price of admission.Sigourney Weaver is radiant as the unsuspecting Eve, and one can understand why Oscar is attracted. I know I was. John Ritter does well enough as Oscar's college professor father, though my opinion is undoubtedly unfairly skewed towards the negative by the fact that I've never gotten over the actor's relentlessly obnoxious character in television's THREE'S COMPANY.TADPOLE is short at 77 minutes, and I was left slightly dissatisfied as the film rolled into the credits after what I thought was a too abrupt ending. Perhaps it's because the Diane/Oscar relationship was so richly humorous and fraught with awkward possibilities, and I wanted more of it.

724917,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B000077VRX,Lee Armstrong,"[4, 5]","""Tadpole"" is a fairly interesting film.  In the era of abstinence, it assumes a permissive attitude about teen sex.  Aaron Stanford who will soon play Pyro in ""X2"" gives an edgy performance as the teen Oscar Grubman who loves Voltaire and pines for his father's wife.  John Ritter as dad Stanley does a nice job of being fatherly and out-of-touch.  Sigourney Weaver's Eve is a brilliant cardiologist who is the apple of Oscar's eye.  Their scene where they try to substitute another organ, the ""liver,"" for ""heart"" is humorous, ""you set my heart aquiver, you broke my liver"" (or whatever the dialogue was).  The best moments in the film belong to Bebe Neuwirth as the cradle-robbing Diane who is a free spirit.  She has a fling with the wonderfully obtuse Phil played by Adam Le Fever, but doesn't let that get in the way of a little midnight fun with Oscar.  She urges her friend Eve to put a little spice in her life and consider an affair with a 15-year old.  Being as she makes this sound even remotely reasonable, she ought to gain special recognition.  Robert Iler as Charlie does a nice job as well.  I wanted to see this movie in the theatre & missed it; so I was surprised about 3 weeks later to find the DVD.  The digital video shooting was distracting for me.  Combined with some of the soap opera dialogue, I felt like I was watching television rather than a feature film.  Still, it's reasonably entertaining.  The restaurant scene with Diane sticking her foot in Osacar's crotch while he's busy trying to impress Eve and Stanley is oblivious is highly entertaining.  So despite its shortcomings, you might as well zip it up and try Tadpole for a one-nighter.

724920,A25ACLV5KPB4W,B000077VRX,"Matt Hetling ""Matt""","[1, 1]","This independent film is about a fifteen year old boy who is in love with his 40 year old stepmother Eve, played by Weaver. Neuwirth plays Eve's sexually charged friend Diane, and Ritter is the boy's father. While home on school break, the boy plans to reveal his love to his stepmother. But before he can, he has a one night stand with Diane while drunk. She is very casual about the sex, but he is overwrought with the possibility that Eve might find out. In the best scene of the movie, Diane drops hints about the affair while the four of them are eating in a restaurant together. Afterward, the boy confesses his love for his stepmother, and she is obviously conflicted, allowing him to kiss her. Ultimately, she rejects him and he moves on to a healthier interest in girls his own age. The movie returns often to a theme of Oscar's enthusiasm for life, which is the key to his attractiveness to older women, who are surrounded by bored people. Eve herself is a rare individual who has maintained the spark of youth into her adulthood. All of the adult actors do a serviceable job, although Neuwirth outshines Weaver, and Ritter outshines them both. The boy who plays Oscar is fine, except for scenes in which he is comically uncomfortable, which he plays too broadly. The movie is fine for what it is, but somehow seemed too thin to sustain its running length. There is a lack of subplots, and the conflict is fairly muted, with not much risk of loss for any of the characters. The most potent conflict would be between Oscar and his father, but Ritter's character remains blissfully ignorant. As it is, we are sympathetic toward Oscar's plight, but don't really feel emotionally involved in the outcome. Instead, we have a prurient interest in who will sleep with Oscar.",3,"Something a little different, but no great shakes",1104796800,"01 4, 2005",2005,1777,"['independent', 'film', 'fifteen', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'who', 'love', '40', 'year', 'old', 'stepmother', 'Eve', 'played', 'Weaver', 'Neuwirth', 'Eve', 'sexually', 'charged', 'friend', 'Diane', 'Ritter', 'boy', 'father', 'home', 'school', 'break', 'boy', 'plans', 'reveal', 'love', 'stepmother', 'can', 'one', 'night', 'stand', 'Diane', 'drunk', 'very', 'casual', 'sex', 'overwrought', 'possibility', 'Eve', 'might', 'find', 'out', 'best', 'scene', 'movie', 'Diane', 'hints', 'affair', 'four', 'are', 'eating', 'restaurant', 'together', 'Afterward', 'boy', 'love', 'stepmother', 'obviously', 'conflicted', 'allowing', 'kiss', 'Ultimately', 'healthier', 'interest', 'girls', 'own', 'age', 'movie', 'returns', 'often', 'theme', 'Oscar', 'enthusiasm', 'life', 'key', 'attractiveness', 'older', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'surrounded', 'bored', 'people', 'Eve', 'rare', 'individual', 'who', 'maintained', 'spark', 'youth', 'adulthood', 'adult', 'actors', 'do', 'serviceable', 'job', 'Neuwirth', 'outshines', 'Weaver', 'Ritter', 'boy', 'who', 'Oscar', 'fine', 'scenes', 'comically', 'uncomfortable', 'too', 'broadly', 'movie', 'fine', 'what', 'somehow', 'seemed', 'too', 'thin', 'sustain', 'running', 'length', 'lack', 'subplots', 'conflict', 'fairly', 'muted', 'not', 'much', 'risk', 'loss', 'characters', 'most', 'potent', 'conflict', 'would', 'be', 'Oscar', 'father', 'Ritter', 'character', 'blissfully', 'ignorant', 'are', 'sympathetic', 'Oscar', 'plight', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'feel', 'emotionally', 'involved', 'outcome', 'Instead', 'have', 'prurient', 'interest', 'who', 'will', 'sleep', 'Oscar']",Tadpole

Its director, Gary Winick, won the Director's Award at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival. Miramax then paid the producers of this independent project several million dollars for it. Who will ever understand the business of Hollywood?The movie tells the story of a bright, privileged, fifteen-year old New Yorker named Oscar [Aaron Stanford] who is in love with his stepmother, Eve [Sigourney Weaver]. He comes home from prep school for Thanksgiving determined to let her know. His plan is easier thought up than done. The house is crowded with friends and family, his loving father [John Ritter] is always in the way, and attractive girls his age keep popping up at the wrong times. Frustrated, he goes out and gets drunk one night and ends up at Diane's [Bebe Neuwirth] house. They make love, which complicates matters because Diane is Eve's best friend. The kid may have had his affair with an older woman, but not only is she the wrong woman, she also has a hard time keeping a secret.The cast is fun and makes the most of the script, which has moments of great wit but doesn't seem entirely fleshed out, especially with its ..., cop-out ending. I personally had a problem with Stanford's role. He is a fine actor, one to keep an eye on. He was twenty-four when he made the movie, and, through no fault of his own, his Oscar has the look and body language of someone in his twenties, rather than someone who is fifteen. [I didn't know Stanford's age when I watched the movie.] Consequently, much of what is supposed to be shockingly fresh and funny gets watered down.

Mature beyond his fifteen years, he's enthralled with his stepmother Eve (subtlety played by Sigourney Weaver).  He dreams of long philosophical talks and more with her, while rejecting the more appropriate options of the girls his own age.  While his obsession goes unnoticed by his father (John Ritter) and Eve, his latent charms do attract the attention of Sigourney's best friend (the ever-so-sultry Bebe Newirth), who is more than happy to seduce and exploit the young innocent.If you haven't spotted the conundrum behind all of this, let me spell it out more distinctly.  How can a responsible adult (a classification that probably excludes me) enjoy a movie built on the premise of a forty year old seducing a fifteen year old?  If the adult were a man and the teenager was female, there would have been a ton of protests about the exploitation and lack of consequences.  It's a reverse Lolita.  But despite that critical flaw, Tadpole is an extremely literate movie.  The dialogue could have been written by Noel Coward, the cast is polished and the pacing is near-perfect.In one hilarious scene, Oscar is about to exit Bebe's apartment after their overnight encounter.  But he encounters her boyfriend who immediately assumes that Oscar is one of her chiropractic patients.  Remarks like ""doesn't she just turn you inside/out?"" are delivered with therapeutic concern but received as being sexual inquisition, resulting in one very confused teenager, until he realizes that the friend is completely unaware of what had transpired over the last few hours.I can't help but wonder if the subject matter caused one or two scenes to be left on the cutting room floor, as the movie is incredibly short by today's standards.
