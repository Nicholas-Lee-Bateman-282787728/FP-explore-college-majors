It's not the standard run of the mill film that everybody would like, but it's incredibly non-judgmental and sweet.

I have seen Cary Grant with his other onscreen ladies, and he does not always create a heat wave when he's in his romantic element. Oh, he's charming, al right.

Though it starts out somewhat draggy and boring with an opening scene in the administrative office of one Dr. Rodney Elwell (Hume Cronyn) with the craggy Margaret Hamilton setting the scene with him for some character exposition, your patience will be richly rewarded if you just hold on a few minutes for Dr. Noah Praetorius (Cary Grant) to show up.The setting is a medical school, with all it's bureaucratic trappings, and Grant as Dr. Praetorius is an educator with the magic touch of a healer - and a holistic approach to medicine that includes the mind as well as the body. He is also an orchestra conductor, which serves as the musical focus of this movie.One of his students faints in class in the presence of a cadaver, and thus the real story begins. Jeanne Crain is Grant's co-star, and she plays the beautiful and bewildered Deborah Higgins, pregnant, unmarried, and uncertain of her future.I have one word to describe Cary Grant after seeing this film: magnanimous. Of course, no ordinary person in real life could be this kind and altruistic, still it is a pleasant fantasy -- and an exemplary lesson in the art of being human. In the end, Cary Grant is just Cary Grant - an actor with a style and charisma so well-entrenched and so well-anticipated that he is virtually a brand unto his own.Cary Grant reaches the threshold of an addiction here, seriously. Every nerve impulse is so right you cannot take your eyes off him. The 1950's were his golden years. People Will Talk is, to be sure, a comedy-drama, but right up there with North by Northwest in terms of wit and style. If you want to see Grant out of the Hitchcock mold, but NOT in romantic slapstick, this is a film to see and savor. He's the exact same Grant as you'll find in North by Northwest, a ""Dr. Thornhill.""The third, wonderful player is Praetorius' rock steady handyman, butler, and all-around pal Mr. Shunderson, whose past is cloaked in mystery.In the end though, it is the story here that triumphs. Goetz and Mankiewicz's screenplay is unpredictable and quirky at every turn. And very human. And once the story gets going, it won't let go of you!This is really an early take on holistic medicine vs medical bureaucracy, and makes it's contribution to the HMO vs human being argument.

The audio is excellent and I detected only a couple of defects in two scenes  in the video. All in all it is a very good transfer.Although made in 1951, it is refreshingly modern and mature in its content yet it is a feel-good film in spite of the serious nature of some of the subject matter. Cary Grant plays Dr. Noah Praetorius, a medical doctor and professor at a college who also runs his own low-cost clinic. Hume Cronyn plays a fellow doctor and professor who hates Grant's character. He is one of those fellows who doesn't have to be passed over because of someone else or feel he has been unjustly treated to dislike that person. He just has to look around and see someone who is well-liked and successful where he is not to hold a grudge. The wonderful thing about Praetorius that Cronyn's character cannot grasp is that it is not that Praetorius is exercising tremendous willpower in order to to do good because he feels he must live up to some kind of code of conduct. He is just a man with a generous spirit anda a healing soul.  Dr. Praetorius' constant companion is Mr. Shunderson. He isn't in the actual employ of Praetorius, he is just always at his side and has no apparent medical training of any kind. It is the constant presence of this mysterious older man on which Cronyn centers his search for some dirt on Praetorius to hopefully eject him from the university.Further complications arise when Dr. Pretorius treats a young woman (Jeanne Crain) who turns out to be pregnant by her fiance who has just died in combat. The young woman attempts suicide upon hearing her condition. After Dr. Praetorius saves her life Mr. Shunderson points out that nothing has changed, the girl is still all alone and in trouble, and will therefore likely try suicide again.These two subplots set up what could have been a very tragic film but ends up being an uplifting movie about the triumph of the better side of human nature made at the height of McCarthyism. You might even call it a kind of romantic comedy. I hadn't seen this film in years and for some reason wrongly remembered it as having taken place at Christmas. In fact it takes place in the spring. I guess my memory had more to do with the fact that it has a kind of ""spirit of Christmas"" feeling in it the same way that ""Boys' Town"" does. In fact, ""Boys' Town"" is even in one of Warner Bros. Holiday collections even though it has nothing to do with Christmas.

Not only is it one of the very best romance movies, it is also one of the very best Cary Grant movies.  Win-win in other words.Grant plays a renowned gynecologist and college professor,  Doctor Praetorius, in this 1951 glorious black and white film. He is the target of jealousy by his peers who attack him for unconventional practices, including for his having a hulking assistant.  But it is more sinister than that.  For the film's director, Mankiewicz, was targeted by McCarthyism in that era.  Thus, Grant is Mankiewicz's stand in for when he was the main target for a McCarthy attack upon the Director's Guild.While dealing with this 1950s mindset, Grant takes on a new patient played by Jeanne Crain. She is pregnant, unmarried and attempts suicide as a result. Grant sets out to save her. This is not enough for you to be able to separate it from the romance movies of today. What separates it is how much better it is straight across the board than the vast majority of them.  First, a man is playing the lead whereas a lot of today's romances are headed by boys. Likewise, a woman is playing the lead.  No one would ever refer to Grant and Crain as a boy and a girl.  There is real electricity when they come together and there is not any silliness as its basis. Grant has such a lovely, light touch when anyone else would have been terribly over melodramatic with the same material.The screenplay is also first rate as is the direction. Mankiewicz had already won a few Oscars and did not waste his time directing inferior scripts.

A cast of casts: Cary Grant, Jean Crain, Walter Slezak, Hume Cronyn and Sidney Blackmer for starts. Dr.Praetorius (Grant) teaches at the local medical school,attended by his always-present mute (Finlay Currie). A rival doctor connives to get to the bottom of this shameless display. Before long this competent doctor intevenes with one of his students (Crain) in a very gallant,compassionate way before his past catches up to him. Grant's unconcern and Cronyn's connivery builds in suspense. Only at the symphonic finish do things tie together. What contemporary film has room for the doting proud single-dad of Jean Crain's, played by the refined, debonair Sidney Blackmer, a never-do-well professionally, who's only lasting pride is his daughter? Watch the scene around the family farm radio when Dr. Praetorius (Grant) is allowed to comment on those who must humbly watch from the sidelines of life because their talent was undervalued, while others can idle with plentiful farm subsidies. The film is caught in the 50's paranoia of communist conspiracies, the smear of innuendo and a Puritanical society, yet proceeds with great suspense to the end, where it is neatly resolved and justice is served.This should be a film talked about and studied for its character strengths (including eccentricities) moving storyline about the human conditiion, and inspiring belief in the decency of man.

Cary Grant is the mysterious gynecologist who treats his patients holistically. (If my doctor looked like Cary Grant I think I would swoon and faint dead away). He is vaguely aware that he has an enemy in Dr. Elwell (wonderfully played as a fussy, nibbling, gerbil of a man by Hume Cronyn). Cronyn is on a witch hunt (it is the fifties after all) to run Praetorius off the faculty of the university where they teach. Having hired a private investigator, he knows that Praetorius may or may not  really be a doctor, and also that Praetorius' ever present companion is a weird and maybe shady person. Consequently, Praetorius' problems mirror the problems of leftists in the country at the time. He may or may not have done something questionable, it doesn't matter, Elwell will get him anyway, and he is branded by the company he keeps. These were issues that must have been dear to Mankiewicz' heart as he helmed the Director's Guild during the focus of HUAC on Hollywood subversives. Mankiewicz was himself suspected of being such a subversive, and went through a hearing at the Guild similar to the one Grant goes through in the film. Fortunately, Mankiewicz' outcome was as satisfying as Grant's in the film. All of the background is interesting, but the film must stand alone as entertainment. I think it does.This is not the typical Cary Grant comedy where we expect snappy dialogue, his incomparable doubletakes, and exciting heat with his leading lady. In this adaptation of a German play, the dialogue is witty, not snappy, the doubletakes make way for pregnant pauses for the audience to consider carefully, and the heat with the leading lady is a bit more tepid. (No slight to  Jeanne Crain, I am a fan of hers, but the situation in which the characters find themselves is more conjugal than hot). The script is perfect for Mankiewicz, who was raised in a literate home by an academician. The score is classical and lovely, and the message is clear. Folks can be unconventional, but we shouldn't jump to conclusions about character without all of the facts, and people who properly mind their own business don 't need to pry into  the lives of others who are acting within their rights under the law.The problems with the film are that some of the scenes are stagey, and the transitions from one scene to another are a bit choppy. Jeanne Crain (whom Mankiewicz did not like or appreciate) is sometimes not clear in her interpretaion of her character's mood and emotions, so I thought her performance was a little confusing in some of her scenes.Finlay Currie is really splendid as Mr. Shunderson, stage actor Walter Slezak really shows his flair for comedy, and Margaret Hamilton is wonderful in her opening scene.

Cary Grant plays Dr. Noah Praetorius, who both practices and teaches medicine with an apporach that is refreshingly modern, even by today's standards.  When young Deborah Higgins (Jeanne Crain) collapses, the good Doctor learns she is pregnant, unmarried, and suicidal.  After telling her a story about a frog to make her think she is not really pregnant, some things happen and he ends up marrying Deborah.  Meanwhile, Professor Rodney Elwell (Hume Cronyn) find Praetorius's novel methods abominable and is trying to find out the truth about not only the good Doctor but his strange companion, Mr. Shunderson (Finlay Currie).  The film's climax is an inquisition into Praetorius's past (which keeps him from conduction his orchestra made up of all the school's med students), where it seems that he cured people in a backwater town as their butcher.  However, the more Elwell goes after Praetorius, the better the good Doctor looks.  Then there is the unbelievable truth about Mr. Shunderson.For me and a lot of other people the strengths of this film outweigh its weaknesses.  The proposal scene does not really work, Grant's performance goes off in different directions from time to time, and you have to think Professor Elwell is too smart to be this stupid.  But for me the reason I always watch at least the end of this film whenever I can is that the payoff for the mystery of Mr. Shunderson just bowls me over.  Walter Slezak is wonderful as always playing Professor Barker, Praetorius's stout supporter, and although it might be a tad forced I love the scene where the three men are playing with the good Doctor's new train set.  Hume Cronyn creates an extremely bitter little man to be the story's villain (pay attention to the little details of his performance).  Basil Ruysdael does a nice job as the Dean, who finally restores sanity to the proceedings.  Certainly there are massive holes in &quot;People Will Talk,&quot; but for me the sum of the whole is greater than the parts.

I think I've seen almost every Cary Grant film and he has never played a romantic lead successfully.  That scene on the train in North by Northwest - ugh. He is not romantically believable in People Will Talk, Charade, To Catch a Thief, The Philadelphia Story, Suspicion, Father Goose, Notorious etc.  He should have been portrayed as the essential bachelor.On the other hand he is a fine actor.  Being slotted into romantic leads allowed him to relax into a sterotype.  He would have been great in action films, comedy (Arsenic & Old Lace) or anything else that would have stretched him as an actor.

Dr.Praetorius has the temerity to do more than just push pills - he also treats the human spirit and psyche. His philosophy is that attitude is key in the healing process.Jealousy and small mindedness fuels the zealot in question - Professor Elwell, played by Hume Cronyn. When Elwell digs long enough and discovers Praetorius's not-so-open-book past, he goes on a crusade which culminates into a hearing. The attitude is clear and typical at that time in history - ""if we don't understand something, then let's burn it at the stake!""This story is loaded with witty and rapid-fire dialog, humor, and a few wonderful characters including best friend, Professor Barker, played by the incomparable Walter Slezak, and Shunderson portrayed by Finlay Currie.Probably the most evident is the charm, dynamics, vigor, and energy Grant brings to this role. As a physician, husband, and conductor of the college orchestra, Grant's Praetorius brings a believable, honest vitality to the story.And much like the ribbon on the package, the movie's underlying musical score is based on Brahms ""Academic Festival Overture"" (Akademische Festouvert&uuml;re) which lingers long after the movie is over.

Based on a German play by Curt Goetz that was produced the previous year - which explains why Grant's character's real name is Ludwig - he plays a doctor at an unspecified university in the United States (the campus scenes were shot at Princeton) who attracts the envy and enmity of one of his peers, a weasel of a fellow named Elwell (Hume Cronyn). Elwell seems obsessed with driving Praetorius out of the faculty by exposing his supposedly shady past. It turns out, however, that Praetorius is a most selfless and noble person, and Grant plays him so well he makes you wish you could be just like him. He is fiercely devoted to his patients - to the point where he seems to have married one (Jeanne Crain) to save her life.

356427,A2F7XTL4KHDZME,630310245X,Stephen Reginald,"[116, 118]","Another one of Joseph L. Mankiewicz's films to be lost in the wake of All About Eve, People Will Talk is a terrific comedy/drama featuring a wonderful cast.  Cary Grant is Dr. Praetorius whose treatment of patients is somewhat controversial and unconventional.  When he befriends a young, unmarried pregnant woman (Jeanne Crain), Grant finds himself the focus of an investigation lead by a jealous collegue (Hume Cronyn) at the university where they both teach.  Grant's interest and concern for Crain goes so far as his proposing marriage.  And then there's the matter of Mr. Shunderson (Finlay Currie), Grant's seemingly simple-minded, yet constant companion.  No one seems to know the details of Mr. Shunderson's life, except Grant, and he's not telling.  Not a huge hit when first released, People Will Talk has developed an almost cult following today, and like many past film &quot;failures,&quot; it's now considerd a pretty good film.  Perhaps it was ahead of its time, but it has some wonderfully rich characterizations, including great turns by the aforementioned Currie, Hume Cronyn, Walter Slezak, Sidney Blackmer, and a terrific bit by an unbilled Margaret Hamilton as Miss Pickett to keep the narrative moving.  My favorite scene is Grant's visit to Crain's uncle's house (she and her father life with her uncle).  Grant, Blackmer, Currie, and Crain are all sitting on the front porch.  Crain objects to being the center of their discussion and refuses to leave the porch.  She goes so far as to scream the cook's name &quot;Bella&quot; at the top of her lungs, rather than move from her perch.  What the movie does say about the practice of medicine and human relationships is perhaps more relevant today than when first released in 1951.  As with most Mankiewicz films, it is successful on the surface.  If there was another intent by the director to tell another tale or an allusion to something else, look at this as an added bonus.  Fans of Cary Grant will not be disappointed; this is one of his best and most relaxed performances on film.  And fans of Jeanne Crain will be pleased as well.  Her role is the more difficult one and she pulls it off quite well, besides looking beautiful in ordinary farm-girl dress.

Adapted to the American screen from writer Curt Goetz' ""Frauenartz Dr. Praetorius"", the plot is simple and somewhat superficial. In the hands of director Joseph L. Mankiewicz, though, it turns into a gentle, thought provoking comedy of manners that showcases Cary Grant's genius at debonair humor, even though it might come in the middle of surrounding high drama.The movie opening introduces us to the immediate plot line, with Hume Cronyn, playing a stuffy professor of medicine obviously envious of the good Dr. Praetorius, investigating Cary Grant's background prior to arriving at the university. The romantic interest is carried by Dr. Praetorius being smitten with student Jean Crain (who, at 25, was initially considered to be too old to play the co-ed role) and her out-of-wedlock predicament.If one is asked what the movie is about, it is a queston that is difficult to answer. The plot is fluff, but the themes of medical ethics, humane treatment of patients, selflessness and witch hunt prosecution of the innocent are universal and apropos of modern life. At one point, Dr. Praetorius speaks about the unthinking distillation of medicine to the point of creating a ""mechanical doctor."" Needless to say, love conquers all and the righteous prevail. All this, set to the rousing strains of Brahms' ""Academic Festival Overture.""The supporting cast is wonderful, from Walter Slezak as the loyal friend to Margaret Hamilton in a delightful scene, to Finlay Currie, as Mr. Shunderson, practically stealing every scene he is in. Sidney Blackmer, Will Wright and Basil Ruysdael also play pivotal roles.Much has been written about Cary Grant, more than can be cited in this small review. This movie, released in 1942, was at the beginning of an incredible run of fine movies Grant made (his first credited film was released in 1932) from 1937's ""The Awful Truth"" to ""Walk, Don't Run"" in 1966. Writers have commented on his good looks, his sartorial elegance, his panache, all the way to his dimpled chin. But, in my opinion, if one wants to understand what a complete actor he was, watch his hands. They are never out of character; they  are always doing exactly what his character needs. They are as elegant, whether in drama or comedy, as Cary's character needs them to be.As for the DVD version, there is nothing notable extra on the disk, but it is a good, clean copy. I saw only one awkward cut during a scene on the farm porch, otherwise it is intact. I last owned this movie in Beta format and have not seen it in some time, since it is no longer played on television.

356436,ARFCORBCTKX1J,630310245X,"William Sommerwerck ""grizzled geezer""","[21, 32]","&quot;People Will Talk&quot; used to be one of my favorite movies. Watching it again reveals that -- dramatically -- it's as sterile and antiseptic as Dr. Praetorius's operating room.&quot;Talk&quot; -- and I deliberately selected &quot;Talk&quot; rather than &quot;People&quot; as the shorthand -- was Joseph Mankiewicz's follow-up to &quot;All About Eve.&quot; He'd no doubt had this project on the burner, and &quot;Eve&quot;'s huge success gave him the clout to get it produced.The story (from a German play) must have looked nice on paper -- an idealistic doctor keeps an out-of-wedlock pregnant woman from committing suicide, while successfully defending himself from unjust charges of medical impropriety -- but it doesn't play well on film. Not in Mankiewicz's adaptation, anyway.Mankiewicz is more interested in being clever than humane, and in a story about what it means to be humane, he fails to make a sincere connection with the characters' inner lives. Even when the characters are forced to confront their situations, Mankiewicz's penchant for witty dialog overrides believable dramatic interaction. Issues are resolved in a &quot;verbal Band-Aid&quot; fashion, merely by the application of clever words.&quot;Talk&quot; seems more a reflection of Mankiewicz's personality than anything else. The characters are spokespeople for his views rather than fleshed-out human beings. When Shunderson says he's reached the point where music is just about the only thing he enjoys, you suspect you're hearing Mankiewicz himself. (At the age of 57 -- and, like Mankiewicz, a Brahms freak -- I know what he means.)The principal performances are ineffective. Dr. Praetorius -- who has a history he doesn't want made public -- must have appealed to Cary Grant, who was similarly hounded by rumors about his private life. But his doctor is more charming than deep. There is rarely the sense of &quot;gravitas&quot; you would expect from a person so concerned about the welfare of others. He comes perilously close to expressing a light, almost patronizing attitude towards the problems of human existence. You do, however, get to see the unique ""Grant sidle"" in the barn scene.Jeanne Crain's performance is terrible. She's not only miscast -- there's no chemistry whatever between her and Grant -- but the script requires her to be both intellectually strong _and_ vulnerable enough to attempt suicide, while possessing the mental agility and wit to win a verbal fight with Dr. Elwell (Hume Cronyn). Even Bette or Kate would have had trouble handling all that. Poor Jeanne isn't remotely up to it. *But the supporting players are a delight. Hume Cronyn is at his peak, playing the weaselly Dr. Elwell as a flawed human being, rather than a caricatured villain. Then there's Walter Slezak as a self-absorbed physicist, and marvelous Margaret Hamilton as Dr. Praetorius's ex-housekeeper. She's typecast, but brings far more to the role than you'd expect.&quot;Talk&quot; is more than a half-century old, and shows it in many ways. The thought that an unmarried pregnant woman would even _consider_ suicide seems alien, even to someone (like myself) born before the film was made. The Code-enforced treatment of attempted suicide is delicate (we don't see Crain lying on the floor, only the people gathered around her), while Mankiewicz's reference to abortion -- without actually saying the word -- is a model of brilliant writing any would-be screenwriter should study.So, with all this nay-saying, is &quot;Talk&quot; worth a look? Yes. Mankiewicz's dialog is always fun to hear. (His 1983 biography is titled &quot;Pictures will Talk.&quot;) And the story _does_ have much to say about professional integrity and respect for other people's private decisions. It also presents the older view that medicine is not about treating symptoms, but treating people -- &quot;Helping sick people get well,&quot; as Dr. Praetorius puts it. In an era when motion pictures are rarely &quot;about&quot; _anything_, it's a pleasure to watch a film that -- though it does so in a pompous, even self-righteous manner -- is not embarrassed to say something worth hearing.The DVD (which I purchased 12/09/03) is sharp, finely detailed, with excellent contrast, but a lot of film grain (or is it coding artifacts?) visible in many scenes.* The fault is at least partly Mankiewicz's. There is a lot to be said for Hitchcock's approach of letting the actors find their own way.",3,"a dramatic misfire, but worth seeing",1082073600,"04 16, 2004",2004,4458,"['quot', 'People', 'Will', 'Talk', 'quot', 'used', 'be', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'Watching', 'again', 'dramatically', 'sterile', 'antiseptic', 'Dr.', 'Praetorius', 'operating', 'room.', 'quot', 'Talk', 'quot', 'deliberately', 'selected', 'quot', 'Talk', 'quot', 'rather', 'quot', 'People', 'quot', 'shorthand', 'was', 'Joseph', 'Mankiewicz', 'follow-up', 'quot', 'Eve.', 'quot', ""'d"", 'no', 'doubt', 'had', 'project', 'burner', 'quot', 'Eve', 'quot', 'huge', 'success', 'gave', 'clout', 'get', 'produced.The', 'story', 'German', 'play', 'must', 'have', 'looked', 'nice', 'paper', 'idealistic', 'doctor', 'out-of-wedlock', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'committing', 'suicide', 'successfully', 'defending', 'unjust', 'charges', 'medical', 'impropriety', ""n't"", 'play', 'well', 'film', 'Not', 'Mankiewicz', 'adaptation', 'anyway.Mankiewicz', 'more', 'interested', 'being', 'clever', 'humane', 'story', 'what', 'be', 'humane', 'make', 'sincere', 'connection', 'characters', 'inner', 'lives', 'Even', 'when', 'characters', 'are', 'forced', 'confront', 'situations', 'Mankiewicz', 'penchant', 'witty', 'dialog', 'overrides', 'believable', 'dramatic', 'interaction', 'Issues', 'are', 'resolved', 'quot', 'verbal', 'Band-Aid', 'quot', 'fashion', 'merely', 'application', 'clever', 'words.', 'quot', 'Talk', 'quot', 'more', 'reflection', 'Mankiewicz', 'personality', 'anything', 'else', 'characters', 'are', 'spokespeople', 'views', 'rather', 'fleshed-out', 'human', 'beings', 'When', 'Shunderson', 'reached', 'point', 'where', 'music', 'just', 'only', 'thing', 'suspect', ""'re"", 'hearing', 'Mankiewicz', 'age', '57', 'Mankiewicz', 'Brahms', 'freak', 'know', 'what', 'principal', 'performances', 'are', 'ineffective', 'Dr.', 'Praetorius', 'who', 'history', ""n't"", 'want', 'made', 'public', 'must', 'have', 'appealed', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'who', 'was', 'similarly', 'hounded', 'rumors', 'private', 'life', 'doctor', 'more', 'charming', 'deep', 'rarely', 'sense', 'quot', 'quot', 'would', 'expect', 'person', 'so', 'concerned', 'welfare', 'others', 'perilously', 'close', 'expressing', 'light', 'almost', 'patronizing', 'attitude', 'problems', 'human', 'existence', 'do', 'however', 'get', 'see', 'unique', 'Grant', 'sidle', 'barn', 'scene.Jeanne', 'Crain', 'performance', 'terrible', 'not', 'only', 'miscast', 'chemistry', 'Grant', 'script', 'be', 'intellectually', 'strong', '_and_', 'vulnerable', 'enough', 'attempt', 'suicide', 'possessing', 'mental', 'agility', 'wit', 'win', 'verbal', 'fight', 'Dr.', 'Elwell', 'Hume', 'Cronyn', 'Even', 'Bette', 'Kate', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'trouble', 'handling', 'Poor', 'Jeanne', ""n't"", 'remotely', '*But', 'supporting', 'players', 'are', 'delight', 'Hume', 'Cronyn', 'peak', 'playing', 'weaselly', 'Dr.', 'Elwell', 'flawed', 'human', 'being', 'rather', 'caricatured', 'villain', 'Then', 'Walter', 'Slezak', 'self-absorbed', 'physicist', 'marvelous', 'Margaret', 'Hamilton', 'Dr.', 'Praetorius', 'ex-housekeeper', 'typecast', 'far', 'more', 'role', ""'d"", 'expect.', 'quot', 'Talk', 'quot', 'more', 'half-century', 'old', 'many', 'ways', 'thought', 'unmarried', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'would', 'even', '_consider_', 'suicide', 'alien', 'even', 'someone', 'born', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'Code-enforced', 'treatment', 'attempted', 'suicide', 'delicate', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'Crain', 'lying', 'floor', 'only', 'people', 'gathered', 'Mankiewicz', 'reference', 'abortion', 'actually', 'saying', 'word', 'model', 'brilliant', 'writing', 'would-be', 'screenwriter', 'should', 'study.So', 'nay-saying', 'quot', 'Talk', 'quot', 'look', 'Yes', 'Mankiewicz', 'dialog', 'always', 'fun', 'hear', '1983', 'biography', 'titled', 'quot', 'Pictures', 'will', 'Talk.', 'quot', 'story', '_does_', 'have', 'much', 'say', 'professional', 'integrity', 'respect', 'other', 'people', 'private', 'decisions', 'also', 'older', 'view', 'medicine', 'not', 'treating', 'symptoms', 'treating', 'people', 'quot', 'Helping', 'sick', 'people', 'get', 'well', 'quot', 'Dr.', 'Praetorius', 'era', 'when', 'motion', 'pictures', 'are', 'rarely', 'quot', 'quot', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'film', 'so', 'pompous', 'even', 'self-righteous', 'manner', 'not', 'embarrassed', 'say', 'something', 'worth', 'hearing.The', 'DVD', 'purchased', '12/09/03', 'sharp', 'finely', 'detailed', 'excellent', 'contrast', 'lot', 'film', 'grain', 'coding', 'artifacts', 'visible', 'many', 'scenes', '*', 'fault', 'least', 'partly', 'Mankiewicz', 'lot', 'be', 'said', 'Hitchcock', 'approach', 'letting', 'actors', 'find', 'own', 'way']",People Will Talk VHS
