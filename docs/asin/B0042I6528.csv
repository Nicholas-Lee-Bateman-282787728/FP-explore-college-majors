Now I was happy that I found out that the entire series was out and I picked it up.

This is the best you will get of this show because I don't think they will ever fully release it but that's ok because this is actually a good product. My only complaints of this is one the show just cuts off because it was canceled and they never got to finish the story and 2nd the animation quality is amazing for the first couple episodes then just drops. I dunno if the animators were getting lazy or what but the quality is not nearly as good as it was in the first episodes.

1383236,A1KZ4J23ZOSWN4,B0042I6528,JohnGaunt,"[51, 55]","""The Pirates of Dark Water"" is a wonderful cartoon series from the 1990s.  A fantasy world is endangered and dying; only one man can save it.  Humanoids and monstrous creatures abound.  The character designs have a distinct Arabian or Sinbad feel to them.  The protagonists are not a typical do-gooders; for example, they stole their sailing ship in the first episode.  And (minor) characters do perish.  The animation is typical Hanna-Barbera fare, but the voice acting is distinctive and includes Tim Curry and the woman who voiced the Little Mermaid.  The content is 4 or 5-star content and very enjoyable.After so many years of VHS tapes, illegal downloads, and streaming video, this series was finally released on DVD by Warner Brothers in 2010.  It is a burn-on-demand product, so it should remain in-print for a long time to come.  However, the audio and video have not been remastered for this DVD.  No extras have been added either.

1383237,A6S7BFWB40M6B,B0042I6528,KAB,"[1, 1]","This is another made-to-order, bare bones (no special features) release from the ""Warner Brothers Archive Collection."" Again, the production material looks like a VHS (but a crisp, clean VHS). However, it is the closest effort that I have seen of the few collections that I have viewed to getting the end of episode bumper right; this collection utilizes the ""swirling star"" (sans ""Taft entertainment"" byline) and replaces the sound effects with what remains of the end theme.""The Pirates of Dark Water"" ran on Saturday mornings in the early '90s on ABC as Hanna-Barbera's last true action cartoon before Turner and company delved into the politically-motivated ""Captain Planet"" or the nauseatingly pointless ""2 Stupid Dogs"" (or, worse yet, the ""Cartoon Cartoons."") I digress. ""Pirates"" casts our unlikely heroes on high-seas adventures in search of the lost thirteen treasures of their home world to save it from the ""Dark Waters."" Forever at their backs, however, was the honey-sweet voiced pirate lord, Bloth, and his witless band of pirates. This is just me, but I'm guessing that Bloth won a few battles; only eight of thirteen treasures were found by Ren and company before the series was pulled from its time slot. More on this later.The series was well animated, the score was catchy, and the characters were well plotted out (Ioz, though being a thief who first joins up for personal gain, proves to be a valuable ally on several occasions, and the dynamic between him and Tula, though a bit overplayed by the end of the series, may have been sort of cliche but it was initially sort of entertaining).Unfortunately, I fear that poor viewership might have gotten in the way of something great. The series ran for one whole season of thirteen episodes and a second partial-season of eight episodes before being mercifully lifted from ABC's Saturday morning timeslot and, to reference a favorite punishment of Bloth's, tossed to the Constrictous.Oddly enough, to review these episodes again, I'm reminded of another of Hanna-Barbera's overlooked, slightly blemished gems, ""Galtar and the Golden Lance."" Ren, the hero in ""Pirates,"" almost resembles Galtar, whilst his major antagonist, Bloth (between his mismatched eyes, the beard, down to the voice) almost resembles Galtar's nemesis, Tormak. Also, the fact that each episode actually flows well into the next draws a certain parallel for me, though I could be mistaken.Anyway, a great series and I applaud the Warners for answering the calls of cult fans to release this and several hands full of other series' to DVD through their website at reasonable prices.",4,The Unofficial Fourteenth Treasure of Rool and HB's Final Crowning Achievement,1295308800,"01 18, 2011",2011,2619,"['made-to-order', 'bare', 'bones', 'special', 'features', 'release', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'Archive', 'Collection', 'Again', 'production', 'material', 'VHS', 'crisp', 'clean', 'VHS', 'However', 'closest', 'effort', 'have', 'seen', 'few', 'collections', 'have', 'viewed', 'getting', 'end', 'episode', 'bumper', 'right', 'collection', 'swirling', 'star', 'Taft', 'entertainment', 'byline', 'sound', 'effects', 'what', 'end', 'theme', 'Pirates', 'Dark', 'Water', 'ran', 'Saturday', 'mornings', 'early', ""'90s"", 'ABC', 'Hanna-Barbera', 'last', 'true', 'action', 'cartoon', 'Turner', 'company', 'delved', 'politically-motivated', 'Captain', 'Planet', 'nauseatingly', 'pointless', '2', 'Stupid', 'Dogs', 'worse', 'yet', 'Cartoon', 'Cartoons', 'digress', 'Pirates', 'unlikely', 'heroes', 'high-seas', 'adventures', 'search', 'lost', 'thirteen', 'treasures', 'home', 'world', 'save', 'Dark', 'Waters', 'Forever', 'backs', 'however', 'was', 'honey-sweet', 'voiced', 'pirate', 'lord', 'Bloth', 'witless', 'band', 'pirates', 'just', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'Bloth', 'won', 'few', 'battles', 'only', 'eight', 'thirteen', 'treasures', 'were', 'found', 'Ren', 'company', 'series', 'was', 'pulled', 'time', 'slot', 'More', 'later.The', 'series', 'was', 'well', 'animated', 'score', 'was', 'catchy', 'characters', 'were', 'well', 'plotted', 'out', 'Ioz', 'being', 'thief', 'who', 'first', 'up', 'personal', 'gain', 'be', 'valuable', 'ally', 'several', 'occasions', 'dynamic', 'Tula', 'bit', 'overplayed', 'end', 'series', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'sort', 'cliche', 'was', 'initially', 'sort', 'entertaining', '.Unfortunately', 'fear', 'poor', 'viewership', 'might', 'have', 'gotten', 'way', 'something', 'great', 'series', 'ran', 'one', 'whole', 'season', 'thirteen', 'episodes', 'second', 'partial-season', 'eight', 'episodes', 'being', 'mercifully', 'lifted', 'ABC', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'timeslot', 'reference', 'favorite', 'punishment', 'Bloth', 'tossed', 'Constrictous.Oddly', 'enough', 'review', 'episodes', 'again', ""'m"", 'reminded', 'Hanna-Barbera', 'overlooked', 'slightly', 'blemished', 'gems', 'Galtar', 'Golden', 'Lance', 'Ren', 'hero', 'Pirates', 'almost', 'Galtar', 'whilst', 'major', 'antagonist', 'Bloth', 'mismatched', 'eyes', 'beard', 'down', 'voice', 'almost', 'Galtar', 'nemesis', 'Tormak', 'Also', 'fact', 'episode', 'actually', 'well', 'next', 'draws', 'certain', 'parallel', 'could', 'be', 'mistaken.Anyway', 'great', 'series', 'applaud', 'Warners', 'answering', 'calls', 'cult', 'fans', 'release', 'several', 'hands', 'full', 'other', 'series', 'DVD', 'website', 'reasonable', 'prices']",Pirates Of Dark Water

For that alone, I'd give this set 5 stars hands down, even given the show's cancellation and thus ""incompleteness."" The packaging looks nice as well.However, I have to dock the set a star for its DVD treatment. Firstly, the content is basically the episodes and that's it. Nothing else.The menus... What menus? It's literally just a blue screen with something like Warner Classics Archive at the top and two options: Play All and Episodes, nothing else. No language or subtitle selections. No special features, no trailers for this or other shows.Lastly, MOD. Manufacture-on-Demand... I'm beginning to dislike MOD, for its incompatibility with my main DVD player.The first player I played it in, played the opening credits fine. After that, it gets about 1-2 minutes into an episode and then starts ""pausing"" (for lack of a better descriptor) ever 5-15 seconds throughout a given episode. There's no way I could ever watch an episode like that. It's like literally in mid-sentence the picture just stops for several seconds then picks up again, and a few seconds later in stops for a few seconds and starts again. I eventually just had to turn it off...After I ""played"" it (and I use the term loosely) in the main player I shoved it into my little portable DVD player and it played fine, without issues. So, I have to assume it's the way the MOD process works. I assume it's burned media that's not widely compatible with some large swath of DVD players. So, be warned, if you only have a single DVD player, and it's an older player, these discs MIGHT NOT play properly on your player. If your player is newer, especially if it supports all the newer burned media types like DVD +/- R/RW, it should hopefully play okay (unless some of the discs are just defective).But, once you get past the technical challenges and the fact there's nothing in terms of bonus materials, it's a really great classic cartoon series. I just wish it was ""finished."" Maybe some day they'll do a mini-series to tie up the loose ends, or some kind of motion comic special feature(s) on future releases to tell the last bits of the story.If you like this show, you might want to also check out one of its contemporaries:Exosquad. Very different show, but equally great cartoon. One of my other prime favorites from my youth.One other note is on the current price ~$32 as of this review. I'm not sure why the price is so high. Amazon claims the MSRP is around $39.99, but the show is available online directly from WB for a seemingly regular price $29.95, belying Amazon's MSRP.

It might be that I was quite old when this came out (20) and I lost interest in ""kids"" cartoons after that, but none later on ever lived up to the greatness of The Pirates Of Dark Water. It had quite a dark and sinister tone for a Saturday morning cartoon, and those watercolor animations still hold up well to this day. Seriously, there are a ton of American cartoons made in 2011 that don't have as good of animation as this show did. Also, in contrast to many cartoons of its time, there was some actual violence where the consequence was obviously death. No hitting an enemy once and having him/her just lay there knocked out. Nope. sometimes people obviously died. I have waited since the DVD format first came out to get this show on DVD and finally it's here. The visuals are nice... I wouldn't say that it looks like they remastered it or anything, but I'd say the quality is close to what you'd expect form watching a brand new VHS tape. And honestly, seeing as though this is a 2 decade old show, it's way better looking than I thought it would be.

We had alot of action cartoons which, in my opinion, are better then humor cartoons. Both decades were a new golden age for cartoons.Pirates of Dark Water is a sci-fi/fantasy animated series debuting in 1991 on the Fox Kids network. Pirates of Dark Water takes place on a planet called Mer which is in danger of being consumed by dark water, an evil substance created by a satanic being called the Dark Dweller. Only Ren, a young prince can stop it by finding the lost thirteen Treasures of Rule. Ren and his friends Niddler, a monkey-bird, Ioz, a pirate, and Tula, an ecomancer set out to find the treasures and save Mer while sailing on their ship, the Wraith. However they are pursued by the evil pirate-lord Bloth who wants the treasures and use them to control dark water.One of my all time favorite shows, Pirates of Dark Water is a great show. But the show came to an end too early. Due to expensive production costs and failing to meet the airdates, the series was never completed, ending abruptly after 21 episodes with only eight of the thirteen treasures collected.Here are the episodes:1.The Quest-A prince named Ren rescues an old man from the sea and learns that he is his father, King Primus. Before dying, the old man tells him to seek out the 13 Treasure of Rule to save Mer. Ren is then kidnapped by Bloth who was responsible for death of King Primus, but he is later rescued by Niddler, a monkey-bird. Ren learns of his father's mystical quest to save their homeland, ""recruits"" a somewhat unlikely crew, finds the first of the legendary Thirteen Treasures of Rule, and is on his way.2.Dishonor-Ren directs the ship into the cavernous island of the Atani to escape Bloth and his pirates, and Ioz and Tula display their ""shady"" natures by pilfering some of the Atani's wealth and knowledge in the form of gold and library scrolls, while Konk gets away with the Compass and the First Treasure of Rule.3.Breakup-Ren and his friends while pursuing Konk, arrive on on island where monkey-birds are sold as slaves. Niddler who was once a slave himself suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder. Ren and his friends free the monkey-birds and their queen from slavery. During the salve revolt, Ren and Niddler are separated from their friends and are kidnapped by Bloth.4.Betrayal.-Ren meets one of his father's aides, a woman named Avagon, among Bloth's other prisoners. Ioz and Tula chase Konk to Janda-town and reacquire the Compass and First Treasure with the help of Ioz's friend Zoolie, but Tula demonstrates that she has her own agenda and steals them, taking them to Bloth.5.Victory-Ren realizes his quest is more meaningful than he first thought, and he and Niddler discover the reason for Tula's treachery. The three reunite with Ioz during a prisoner revolt among the Maelstrom, coming away with the first two Treasures, the Compass, more knowledge of the Dark Water, and a strong sense of unity.6.Andorus-Tula learns that she has enchanted powers. She is an ecomancer, an enchantress who can commune with plant and wildlife. She learns of her homeland of Andorus and restores it to life and helps Ren find the third Treasure of Rule.7.A Drop of Darkness-While recovering the fourth treasure, Ren and his friends rescue and old woman who had a romantic interest with his father. She attempts to restore her youth so she can get back what she lost with King Primus through his son.8.The Beast and the Bell-Ren receives a vision from his father's spirit who tells to ring the Bell of the First Sound to stop the Dark Water. He rings the bell but only to free Korruptus, a demon who started the scourge of Dark Water. Ren and his friends must find a way to trap the demon before he can steal the treasures.9.Panacea-Ren and his friends arrive  on the island of island of Myragon to find the fifth treasure. They meet a biotransmuter named Slaggon. He offers them a creature named Roulette who'll help them find the treasure but things aren't what they seem.10.King Niddler-Ren and his friends, while searching for the sixth treasure, arrive at an island surrounded by acidic fog. There, they meet wingless monkey-birds who believe Niddler is their king because of his wings.11.The Collection-Ioz runs into old foes when the crew's resting in Janda-town, and all come into contact with a wizard who shrinks ships and transports them into bottles in his lab, where he can steal their treasures for himself.12.Little Leviathan-Ren and his friends rescue a baby leviathan from dark water. It takes a liking to Ren and his friends. Ren, Ioz and the baby leviathan are soon captured by Bloth and forces them to find the seventh treasure. Ren and his friends are later rescued by leviathans who happend to be Baby's pod.13.The Dark Dweller-A celebration of reaching the halfway point of the Quest is interrupted by the Maelstrom, and when Bloth gives chase, Tula falls into the Dark Water. Ren journeys into the den of the Dark Dweller with Niddler to save her, and the heroes fight their first major battle against the lord of the Dark Water.14.The Dark Disciples-Ren and his friends return to his city of Octopan only to find it in ruins. They meet Morpho and his followers who want the treasures. With the seven treasures, Ren defeats Morpho and restores Octopan.15.The Ghost Pirates. The crew come across a ghost ship which is being controlled by a female captain. They capture Ioz and Ren and his friends must save him before he becomes a ghost forever.16.The Dagron Master-During a storm, Ren and Niddler are separated from their friends and are washed upon an island. They meet a man who breeds and sells dagrons to would-be buyers. He tricks Ren into wearing an armor that turns him into a dagron and he is sold to Bloth.17.The Game Players of Undaar-The Wraith and Maelstrom are captured by two froglike Game Players, who issue Ren and Bloth an ultimatum: they must work together to beat the Game Players' challenging and dangerous game, and if they win, they'll be set free. If they refuse to play or lose the game, they and their friends will die.18.The Pandawa Plague-Jargis the slave-master of monkey-birds is back and he has infected monkey-birds with an artificial plague that turns them into his mindless slaves. Ren and his friends along with the monkey-bird queen set out to save the infected monkey-birds and the egg that will hatch the future monkey-bird queen.19.Sister of the Sword-During a stopover in a port city, Ren runs into a fiesty and troublemaking thief of a girl, who ends up being Ioz's younger sister Solia.20.The Soul Stealer-Bloth and his new ally Morpho concoct a soul-switching potion and use it to swap souls with Ren and Niddler. Meanwhile, Joat, the original owner of the Wraith, comes in pursuit of Ren and Ioz, who stole his ship at the start of the quest.21.The Living Treasure-Ren and his friends find the 8th treasure, it's a living being, a rabbit-like creature. Ren and his friends must capture it while avoiding vicious amazon women on the island.",5,It's high adevntures with the Pirates of Dark Water,1300752000,"03 22, 2011",2011,7065,"['80s', '90s', 'were',
