It did not look ""low budget,"" it looked computer generated.  It was comic book in style and cinematography, but had plot elements of film noir and low class horror movies (complete with soft core porn).  And the acting was subpar, even if they were trying to overact in B movie style, it was barely competent.  Yet all together I felt the film had an identity crisis (how could that be with so much inspiration!?!!?).  This film wanted to be in the vein of Grind House's Death Proof/Planet Terror but ended up being a mess of too many genres fighting for too many directions that ends with a too long car chase scene.

And everything goes downhill from there...They don't make them like this anymore.  DARK COUNTRY is low-budget noir/horror at its finest, a crass, violent, remorseless film whose script (kudus to Tab Murphy) owes quite a bit to Mickey Spillane's hard-hitting noir novels and Richard Matheson's tripping ""Twilight Zone"" episodes.  It is dark and twisted, somewhat of a character study revolving around a couple (Thomas Jane and Lauren German, who manage to carry damn near the whole movie) who don't really know each other, and begin to find out things they aren't comfortable with.  Jane's directing is solid; he knows what he wants--a low budget movie that LOOKS low budget--and manages to pull it off with only a few minor hitches (it slows down a bit near the end, becomes a bit too convoluted to follow closely).  However, it looks cool and feels trippy.  Throw in a few possible supernatural twists, an appearance by Ron Perlman (whose character isn't necessary at all, but it's still nice to see his ugly mug), and an ending Rod Serling would be proud of, and you have one hell of a film.",4,"Atmospheric, stylish horror/noir flick.",1254873600,"10 7, 2009",2009,1234,"['Two', 'newlyweds', 'Vegas', 'are', 'making', 'night', 'drive', 'desert', 'come', 'bloody', 'disfigured', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'car', 'wreck', 'everything', 'downhill', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'anymore', 'DARK', 'COUNTRY', 'low-budget', 'noir/horror', 'finest', 'crass', 'violent', 'remorseless', 'film', 'script', 'kudus', 'Tab', 'Murphy', 'quite', 'bit', 'Mickey', 'Spillane', 'hard-hitting', 'noir', 'novels', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'tripping', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'dark', 'twisted', 'somewhat', 'character', 'study', 'revolving', 'couple', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'Lauren', 'German', 'who', 'manage', 'carry', 'damn', 'whole', 'movie', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'other', 'begin', 'find', 'out', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'comfortable', 'Jane', 'directing', 'solid', 'what', 'low', 'budget', 'movie', 'LOOKS', 'low', 'budget', 'manages', 'pull', 'off', 'only', 'few', 'minor', 'hitches', 'down', 'bit', 'end', 'bit', 'too', 'convoluted', 'follow', 'closely', 'However', 'cool', 'feels', 'trippy', 'Throw', 'few', 'possible', 'supernatural', 'twists', 'appearance', 'Ron', 'Perlman', 'character', ""n't"", 'necessary', 'still', 'nice', 'see', 'ugly', 'mug', 'ending', 'Rod', 'Serling', 'would', 'be', 'proud', 'have', 'one', 'hell', 'film']",N/A

1271037,A32CG0V371FRQ2,B002J4KQ6S,GratedTopping,"[0, 1]","This muddled mess is all over the place. I've read that people compare this to a good ""Twilight Zone"" episode, but that's too-much praise. Here are my various thoughts with spoilers and so forth. Unless you've seen the flick, a lot probably won't make sense.- All I can determine/decide is that Richard's a dead killer, who's buried bodies at a rest-area in the desert. He flees the cops in a vehicle...escapes...crashes due to lots and lots of moths/bugs hitting the windshield and losing control...and being picked up in an injured state by himself and his new wife that he just met and quickly married. They're in a time-loop somehow. Each time, the new Richard that's driving will, in the end, become the one in the crash.- Once the crash-victim speaks, I didn't realize but know that some folks could tell it was actor Thomas Jane.- We learn that at a joint called ""Cheetahs"", Gina had someone who was 'somewhat fixated' on her who came around all the time. That's why she had a gun in her purse: 'for protection'. She thought the crash-victim Richard was that guy because he mentioned ""Cheetahs"" but couldn't tell because his face was so messed-up. So...Richard was a stalker who found and eventually married Gina, too, but he evidently really did love her. Maybe??? The crash-victim Richard told her that he ""never meant to hurt her"". Yet why did Richard even kill Gina? Shewas at the crime scene and among the bodies discovered buried. Or maybe he didn't and thebody was there because of a mob-hit. The policeman spoke of how they have found people out there...victims of mob-hits, murders from gambling debts, etc. He asked if his wife was involved in anything that would result in her having any enemies. Soon, he gets a response from dispatch and tells Richard, in back of the police car, that they found his wife. This was even before she was uncovered at the burial site/rest stop.- Except for a bit of screaming, the crash-victim Richard really calms-down too quickly. Of course he has the shock of how he looks and then, as we learn later, the shock of being in the car with himself driving -- but he seems to take it all pretty-easily, asking for a cigarette and being a back-seat-driver jerk, too, oblivious to any physical pain.- Early in the movie, the almost-dead Richard freaks when the one driving says that it looks like they are at the highway. The almost-dead one says that the way out...then tries to kill the living one (who is himself). Why? What's up? I guess it's because, as we see later, when fleeing the police, the car transfers to a different location/dimension. Policecars were coming from both front and back, but the car's gone suddenly and that was the way out apparently. Soon, the Richard crashes and he gets really banged-up. If Gina was in the car, she'd have been killed or harmed, too, so...I guess he was trying to kill himself (the driver) to prevent it?- Where did the original police car come from? He appeared on the road just flashing into existance (in the same manner that Richard's disappeared later). Why was he coming from some other dimension (whatever)?- ""I told him to stay on route &lt;something>."" says one of the deputies. I forget exactly what it was. Why? This was evidently the same dude in the beginning of the film who was talking to Richard and said that and to also ""take care of that pretty wife"". The police find, apparently with the buried Gina, the watch that living-Richard lost. When he first learned it was missing, his first thought is that it was out in the desert with the Richard that he and Gina buried. To think that is the first place and that he could even FIND it is stupid. However, he had no problem finding the exact location where he buried Richard...though the body was gone when he got there.What made the buried-Richard disappear? We hear shooting from a distance at this time and living-Richard assumed it was Gina firing the gun he gave her when he left her at the rest-stop. . .and that buried-Richard --- who was somehow still alive --- had gone back there to kill here. Was it Gina firing at that time and, if so, who was she firing at? I guess we could think she was firing at a Richard who killed her and buried her at that rest stop. Shewas one of the bodies the police found at the 30-year old rest stop (which the cop stated wasat least that old). Yet when the policeman took living-Richard to the rest stop, it LR wassaying that it wasn't the same one. That's when the police said that it was, but a long time ago.- Seeing the accident-victim Richard strangle driving-Richard while Gina just sat there and didnothing was bad. Afterwards, she did nothing outside of the car while the fight was still going on. Accident-victim Richard was still strangling her husband! Something could have been done there. She soon stupidly yells at living-Richard to stop beating the guy with a rock and then blames him for killing his attacker.- The almost-dead Richard in the backseat in the beginning warned Gina to get away from him (the Richard driving). So...he knew he was a killer and would hurt her but wanted to now help her because of a change of heart? And when Gina's body was dug-up by the police, how could Gina's body be fully-undamaged after 30 years?It's chock-full of confusing aspects. I've seen it twice-through (with a year or so in between) and there just no substance. It wasn't cool and ultimately boring. Also, that scene in the car at the start with Gina getting excited from an icecube was a waste of time and unnecessary.I had hoped the second viewing would have changed my mind about this movie, but it didn't. I really like psychological movies that mess with your mind and have a surprise twist at the end, but this was nothing like what I hoped for. It's no ""Memento"" or ""Triangle"" (for example). With those, I find interesting things to ponder over which make them more interesting. I don't know all the answers to them, but it's good. Here, I have no feeling that having any answers to my questions would make me like this more. I don't think a lot of it really can be figured out. It's just something that's 'there' and there's nothing to grab you. Yes, this is to be a supernatural type of story with events happening not in this world, evidently, so not everything is meant to be sensible -- but I this viewer needed more. It's not presented well at all.Lastly, this movie was supposed to be in 3-D and in theatres, but it was just released direct to DVD. The continual green-screen type of scenes, where the 3-D effect would have been used, are very distracting and majorly ruin the look of the film. Why would they even try and make this 3-D to begin with if it wasn't going to be used?Thomas Jane acted well and his first time directing seemed fine, but the movie's flat and not recommended.",1,"in

Others offer a slow boil, brewing away, giving you information one piece at a time. The clues are there but for some reason they never seem to show themselves clearly until the end. DARK COUNTRY is one such film.Thomas Jane (who also directed) is Richard, a man we know little about other than that he just met the love of his life in Vegas named Gina (Lauren German) and the pair have united in holy matrimony. Waking the next morning, they prepare to move on down the road by driving at night to avoid the heat of the desert.In true film noir fashion, Richard narrates the film and gives his perspective now and then as to what is going on. The night time drive is one filled with discovery as the pair find out more about each other, something most people do prior to rather than after the wedding. During their discussion, the heat rises not only from the desert but from a tease Gina offers Richard that results in some erotic yet not non-nude goings on.As they drive, Richard comments about the sky being so clear in the desert you can drive without your lights on. But when they click them back on the first thing they see is a man stumbling across the road in front of them. They swerve, barely avoiding him but enough to end up off the road. Going back to see if he is okay, they find him alive but banged up beyond recognition.Further up the road they see his car overturned and realize he's been injured severely, most of his face a bloody pulp. They gather him up, place him in the back seat and head out to find help.But as with all good episodes of the classic TV series TWILIGHT ZONE, everything is not what it seems. The victim wakes, at first screaming, then laughing and finally talking to his rescuers. His appearance makes Gina uncomfortable, understandably so. And as the trip progresses, he turns from thankful victim to attacker, resulting in a fight with Richard and his apparent death.Deciding the best way to handle the situation is to simply bury him in the desert to avoid the police, the pair does so. It's not until later down the road that Richard realizes he buried his watch along with him. Returning to the burial site, they find the grave open and the victim gone.It is here things turn even more strange with a roadside rest area, a major argument between the two leads and the culmination of posters seeking missing people that all come together. Add to the mix a state trooper played by Ron Perlman and the strangeness gets twisted and turned enough to hold your interest until the last reel unfolds.The film plays to many of the classic film noir modes, offering the narration I mentioned earlier as well as looking at a seedier side of life that can not result in Disney type glory. These are battered people whose past lives make no difference but who breathe that lifestyle in all they say and do.The film was shot in a special 3-D system (that doesn't transfer on DVD) that gives it a sort of SIN CITY look that bodes well for the tone of the film. The desert here feels hot, emitting an onscreen heat that you can feel while watching. The night feels strange as shot here. Both become not just scenes but characters in this story.Jane and German do a great job in their roles. Jane as the love struck sap willing to do anything for the woman he thinks he loves. German as the seductive woman who sees the chance at a new life with a man who loves here. As I said before, these are not character traits that are explained but ones that develop from the characters we watch on screen.The ending is something most viewers won't see coming. It caught me off guard, not startlingly so but in the surprise of it. Jane as director does a good job of letting this story come at you not in a rush but as a slow burn.Not directly a title for Halloween, but perhaps one that would be good leading up to that mysterious holiday. DARK COUNTRY, while not a perfect film, offers what few movies these days will do. It's a slowly unfolding tale that directs the viewer down the paths it chooses as opposed to what they want. And that disturbing journey is one worth taking for a night's rental.",4,TWILIGHT...AS IN ZONE,1256601600,"10 27, 2009",2009,4264,"['movies', 'smack', 'square', 'face', 'presenting', 'everything', 'up', 'front', 'knocking', 'wind', 'scares', 'have', 'offer', 'Others', 'offer', 'slow', 'boil', 'brewing', 'away', 'giving', 'information', 'one', 'piece', 'time', 'clues', 'are', 'there', 'reason', 'never', 'seem', 'show', 'clearly', 'end', 'DARK', 'COUNTRY', 'one', 'such', 'film.Thomas', 'Jane', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'Richard', 'man', 'know', 'little', 'other', 'just', 'met', 'love', 'life', 'Vegas', 'named', 'Gina', 'Lauren', 'German', 'pair', 'have', 'united', 'holy', 'matrimony', 'Waking', 'next', 'morning', 'prepare', 'move', 'road', 'driving', 'night', 'avoid', 'heat', 'desert.In', 'true', 'film', 'noir', 'fashion', 'Richard', 'film', 'perspective', 'now', 'then', 'what', 'going', 'night', 'time', 'drive', 'one', 'filled', 'discovery', 'pair', 'find', 'more', 'other', 'something', 'most', 'people', 'do', 'prior', 'rather', 'wedding', 'discussion', 'heat', 'not', 'only', 'desert', 'tease', 'Gina', 'Richard', 'results', 'erotic', 'yet', 'not', 'non-nude', 'goings', 'drive', 'Richard', 'comments', 'sky', 'being', 'so', 'clear', 'desert', 'can', 'drive', 'lights', 'when', 'click', 'back', 'first', 'thing', 'see', 'man', 'stumbling', 'road', 'front', 'swerve', 'barely', 'avoiding', 'enough', 'end', 'up', 'road', 'Going', 'back', 'see', 'okay', 'find', 'alive', 'banged', 'up', 'recognition.Further', 'road', 'see', 'car', 'overturned', 'realize', 'been', 'injured', 'severely', 'most', 'face', 'bloody', 'pulp', 'gather', 'up', 'place', 'back', 'seat', 'head', 'find', 'help.But', 'good', 'episodes', 'classic', 'TV', 'series', 'TWILIGHT', 'ZONE', 'everything', 'not', 'what', 'victim', 'wakes', 'first', 'screaming', 'then', 'laughing', 'finally', 'talking', 'rescuers', 'appearance', 'Gina', 'uncomfortable', 'understandably', 'so', 'trip', 'thankful', 'victim', 'attacker', 'resulting', 'fight', 'Richard', 'apparent', 'death.Deciding', 'best', 'way', 'handle', 'situation', 'simply', 'bury', 'desert', 'avoid', 'police', 'pair', 'so', 'not', 'later', 'road', 'Richard', 'buried', 'watch', 'Returning', 'burial', 'site', 'find', 'grave', 'open', 'victim', 'gone.It', 'here', 'things', 'turn', 'even', 'more', 'strange', 'roadside', 'rest', 'area', 'major', 'argument', 'two', 'leads', 'culmination', 'posters', 'seeking', 'missing', 'people', 'come', 'together', 'Add', 'mix', 'state', 'played', 'Ron', 'Perlman', 'strangeness', 'twisted', 'turned', 'enough', 'hold', 'interest', 'last', 'reel', 'unfolds.The', 'film', 'plays', 'many', 'classic', 'film', 'noir', 'modes', 'offering', 'narration', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'as', 'well', 'looking', 'seedier', 'side', 'life', 'can', 'not', 'result', 'Disney', 'type', 'glory', 'are', 'battered', 'people', 'past', 'lives', 'make', 'difference', 'who', 'breathe', 'lifestyle', 'say', 'do.The', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'special', '3-D', 'system', ""n't"", 'transfer', 'DVD', 'sort', 'SIN', 'CITY', 'look', 'bodes', 'well', 'tone', 'film', 'desert', 'here', 'hot', 'emitting', 'onscreen', 'heat', 'can', 'feel', 'watching', 'night', 'feels', 'strange', 'shot', 'here', 'not', 'just', 'scenes', 'characters', 'story.Jane', 'German', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'roles', 'Jane', 'love', 'struck', 'sap', 'willing', 'do', 'anything', 'woman', 'German', 'seductive', 'woman', 'who', 'chance', 'new', 'life', 'man', 'who', 'here', 'said', 'are', 'not', 'character', 'traits', 'are', 'explained', 'ones', 'develop', 'characters', 'watch', 'screen.The', 'ending', 'something', 'most', 'viewers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'caught', 'off', 'guard', 'not', 'startlingly', 'so', 'surprise', 'Jane', 'director', 'good', 'job', 'letting', 'story', 'come', 'not', 'rush', 'slow', 'burn.Not', 'directly', 'title', 'Halloween', 'perhaps', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'leading', 'up', 'mysterious', 'holiday', 'DARK', 'COUNTRY', 'not', 'perfect', 'film', 'what', 'few', 'movies', 'days', 'will', 'do', 'slowly', 'unfolding', 'tale', 'viewer', 'paths', 'as', 'opposed', 'what', 'want', 'disturbing', 'journey', 'one', 'worth', 'taking', 'night', 'rental']",N/A

After trying to help the man, he attacks them, and that's only the beginning of the couple's troubles as we soon learn that things are not quite all they seem here.  Shot in less than a month on a very low budget, Jane makes an impressive turn as a director here, managing to make the most of what little he and his crew have to work with here.  Even though Jane has voiced his displeasure over the film not being presented in what he feels is the best cut, or the fact that it isn't even presented in the intended 3-D format he had in mind, Dark Country still manages to be a compelling, trippy, and surprising little film up to and including its shocker ending, which ends up taking a page right out of The Twilight Zone.  With some gorgeous cinematography (and visual advising from comic artists Tim Bradstreet and Swamp Thing co-creator Bernie Wrightson) and Jane's good pal Ron ""Hellboy"" Perlman on board as well, Dark Country is a more than worthwhile trip that is wholeheartedly worth checking out at the very least.

Supposedly shot in 3D, the film is actor Thomas Jane's directorial debut.  While fairly well written, and with some quality acting, viewed on a standard television, the poorly rendered CG effects tend to detract from the overall impact of the film, which Jane intended to be in the spirit of Rod Serling's Twilight Zone.  Some spoilers follow, so proceed at your own risk.On something of a whim, Dick (Thomas Jane) and Gina (Lauren German) got married in Las Vegas.  They are on the road in the middle of the night headed for California, when they almost run into a man standing in the highway.  Pulling over, they discover that the man has a mangled face and is badly injured.  Unable to call for help, the couple put him into their car and head off in search of a hospital.  When the injured man unexpectedly turns homicidal, Dick kills him.  After the couple buries the body in the desert, they pull over at a rest stop, where Dick discovers that his watch, which can be traced to him, is missing.  Gina remains behind, while he returns to the grave site.  What follows mostly involves the film's big twist, which has Dick on the run from the law, but unable to escape what fate has in store for him.Much of the film features the couple driving in their car.  Apparently all these scenes were shot against a green screen, and unfortunately the processed final images look terribly fake, and are a major visual distraction.  Putting this issue aside, elements of mystery and intrigue do help make Dark Country an interesting watch.  However, how satisfying the story may be is an open question.Lauren German (Hostel Part II) is very good, and Ron Perlman (Hellboy) adds some credibility in a small role as a police officer.  Besides directing, Thomas Jane also contributed to the screenplay.  Jane discusses his thoughts on making the film in a commentary track.  The film rates 3.5 stars for the story and general execution, but the spotty special effects drop the rating to 3 stars.",3,an interesting concept that suffers in the execution...,1325808000,"01 6, 2012",2012,2196,"['Following', 'newly', 'wedded', 'couple', 'travelling', 'night', 'desert', 'Dark', 'Country', '2009', 'strange', 'journey', 'huge', 'twist', 'hard', 'say', 'much', 'giving', 'things', 'away', 'Supposedly', 'shot', '3D', 'film', 'actor', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'directorial', 'debut', 'fairly', 'well', 'written', 'quality', 'acting', 'viewed', 'standard', 'television', 'poorly', 'rendered', 'CG', 'effects', 'tend', 'detract', 'overall', 'impact', 'film', 'Jane', 'intended', 'be', 'spirit', 'Rod', 'Serling', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'spoilers', 'follow', 'so', 'proceed', 'own', 'risk.On', 'something', 'whim', 'Dick', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'Gina', 'Lauren', 'German', 'got', 'married', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'are', 'road', 'middle', 'night', 'headed', 'California', 'when', 'almost', 'run', 'man', 'standing', 'highway', 'Pulling', 'over', 'discover', 'man', 'mangled', 'face', 'badly', 'injured', 'Unable', 'call', 'help', 'couple', 'put', 'car', 'head', 'search', 'hospital', 'When', 'injured', 'man', 'unexpectedly', 'homicidal', 'Dick', 'couple', 'body', 'desert', 'pull', 'over', 'rest', 'stop', 'where', 'Dick', 'watch', 'can', 'be', 'traced', 'missing', 'Gina', 'grave', 'site', 'What', 'mostly', 'film', 'big', 'twist', 'Dick', 'run', 'law', 'unable', 'escape', 'what', 'fate', 'store', 'him.Much', 'film', 'couple', 'driving', 'car', 'Apparently', 'scenes', 'were', 'shot', 'green', 'screen', 'unfortunately', 'processed', 'final', 'images', 'look', 'terribly', 'fake', 'are', 'major', 'visual', 'distraction', 'Putting', 'issue', 'aside', 'elements', 'mystery', 'intrigue', 'do', 'help', 'make', 'Dark', 'Country', 'interesting', 'watch', 'However', 'how', 'satisfying', 'story', 'may', 'be', 'open', 'question.Lauren', 'German', 'Hostel', 'Part', 'II', 'very', 'good', 'Ron', 'Perlman', 'Hellboy', 'credibility', 'small', 'role', 'police', 'officer', 'directing', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'also', 'contributed', 'screenplay', 'Jane', 'thoughts', 'making', 'film', 'commentary', 'track', 'film', 'rates', '3.5', 'stars', 'story', 'general', 'execution', 'spotty', 'special', 'effects', 'drop', 'rating', '3', 'stars']",N/A
