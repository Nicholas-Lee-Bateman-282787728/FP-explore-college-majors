These aren't action movies.  They're not light viewing.  They go at their own pace.Killing them softly is a very simple story about the repurcussions of a card game heist by a couple of low level street criminals.  There's not a lot of hand-holding or exposition, things are discussed and not clearly explained at times, it's really just a quick snapshot of come cause and effect in the criminal underworld.  It's not about a complex plot or happy endings.Not a lot of action, but some great performances and overall excellent mood setting and atmosphere.  The guys who pull the heist have nothing and come from nothing, they have nothing to lose and are put up to it by someone who's obviously overreaching, thinking he's out of harm's way.Anyway - this is more of a mood piece, more cerebral, more of a slow burn.  Brad Pitt is excellent as usual, as is everyone else.  I think the best performance is by Scoot McNairy - who I also enjoyed in Monsters.  He's a really promising young actor, and his character is absolutely heartbreaking.I don't understand all the hate for this film.  I think it's absolutely great.

Brad Pitt gives a highly disciplined performance as a hit man brought in to restore order in the Boston criminal underworld after the power balance has been upset by a couple of kids robbing a protected poker game.The movie honours Higgins' style of driving the plot forward through electric dialogue. In essence this movie is about a series of business meetings, except the business under discussion is the organisation and execution of crime and murder. The parallels between the unvarnished capitalism of crime and the hollowness of the American dream is skillfully, though perhaps a trifle heavy-handedly, drawn.It is a brutal portrayal of violence, but with little gratuitous gore, and no sympathetic characters.

Higgins Coogans trade which also resulted in a classic Sopranos episode ""Amour Fou"" which had thieves trying to rob a mob game without the smartness.A laundry man John Amato ( Vincent Curatola) has a plan to rob a mob game with the help of two idiots Scoot McNairy as Frankie along with Ben Mendelsohn  as Russell, a heroin addict.  , run by Markie Trattman ( Ray Liotta). The idiots are against it but Amato insists that no one will suspect them because the game has been robbed before by Markie himself. So naturally the suspicion will fall on him. The game is hit and Richard Jenkins hires Jackie ( Pitt) to clean up the mess created by the idiots. Jackie sublets this job to a out of town hitman Mickey ( James Gandolfini) who has a taste for hard drinking and women.The sub text and backdrop of this film is the economic downturn, the 2008 election and the grittier side of New Orleans post Katrina, Andrew Dominik's film is an engaging look at the criminal world with a lot of blood and beatdowns.Brad Pitt is amazing as the actor who is often unnoticed. Scooty McNairy and James Gandolfini are amazing as well.Its impossible to miss the not so subtle background of economic ruin of 2008 and its effect of the fallout on everything including the mob. The final scene is in a bar and Pitts finds out that he has been paid less for a job.Its Obama speaking about  reclaiming the American dream and reaffirm that fundamental truth, that, out of many, we are one...Cogan :This guy wants to tell me we're living in a community?

1591918,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B009AMAL4Y,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","Basically a collection of conversations that revolve around economic crisis, the Mob and some foolish hoodlums, `Killing Them Softly' depends a lot on the natural chemistry between the actors to sell its every frame, and the actors don't disappoint.  It has style (thanks to some sharp shots and slick cinematography) and it carries a poignant theme (that has a tendency to oversell itself at times), but this is a complete actors piece, and as an ensemble this is one of the best of the year.The film opens with a small time hood getting propositioned to rip off a Mob protected card game.  With a failsafe plan (or so he thinks) he steals the money with a loose tongued addict and winds up being hunted by Jackie Cogan, an enforcer hired to take out the problem and restore order to the games.  Cogan is sharp and takes note of the details, setting up all the right moves with his buddy Mickey (Gandolfini in top notch perfection).  As the walls come crashing in, the small time crooks find themselves in a state of panic, and once Cogan sets his sights on them it's all over.`Killing Them Softly' had the chance to be perfect.  From a purely thematic standpoint, it's pretty impressive.  The point made about the economy and the state of America as a whole (greedy and selfish) is a very important one, but Dominik really needed to pull in the reigns a tad.  The constant vocal overlay that thrusts political viewpoints in our ears like some sort of subconscious manipulation was just too much.  All of that stripped out and the mere conversations (so rich) to fall back on and this film would have been EVERYTHING.  The closing statement, Pitt's words, have so much meaning and carry so much weight and yet they are dampened because of the fact that the film has already lead us to believe those words so many times before.  Take out all the unnecessary news clips and you would have had one of the best films of 2012.Still, this is a great film and one that should be seen.

1591926,A3KUEXN9M9FOMH,B009AMAL4Y,billy,"[55, 69]","On paper, Killing Them Softly sounds like a winning proposition.  It's from director Andrew Dominick, who helmed The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, one of the finest films of the past decade. It features some excellent actors; Brad Pitt, James Gandolfini, Scott McNairy, Ray Liotta, Richard Jenkins, and Vincent Curatola are all fine actors.  In execution however, the film is a mixed bag. It alternates between a slow talky existential gangster movie and a very blunt political satire.  The finished product has some nice standout scenes and dialogue, but it's too slow and too muddled to be considered a success.The plot centers around a heist of a poker game that sends the local mafia in New Orleans in to an economic tailspin.  This all happens during the run up to the 2008 presidential election of Barack Obama.  Parallels are drawn between the gangsters in the movie and the people on Wall Street and in Washington who perpetrated the housing bubble that lead to the economic crash.  Criminal activity freezes up and money quits moving, similar to the credit shortage attributed to the banking crash.  Just about every scene has talk radio or CSPAN on in the background.A few individual scenes stand out.  The heist sequence is near perfect.  Gandolfini's scenes, though somewhat superfluous to the overall narrative, are acted with authority.  Gandolfini really is a fine actor, and he pulls of his scenes with gusto.  The drive out for the final hit is quite well done and suspenseful.The problem is the individual scenes don't really make for a satisfying whole.  I found the narrative rather slow and too deliberately paced, and this is coming from a guy who normally enjoys when a film takes it's time.  The political subtext is not really subtext at all, considering it almost continuously runs in the background of every scene.  It's about as subtle as a kick in the teeth.  Too much of the film can be summed up as aging and depressed gangsters discussing things in bars, cars, and hotel rooms while political talk radio or CSPAN run in the background.If you're in to gangster movies then this is worth a look.  It's artistically accomplished and frequently quite arresting visually.  It lacks the painterly compositions Richard Deakins accomplished for Jesse James, but it's grit and grime really come through.  Dominick is obviously a talented director, but he give in to some of his own excesses here a bit too much.",3,Wasted Potential,1355356800,"12 13, 2012",2012,2460,"['paper', 'Killing', 'Them', 'Softly', 'winning', 'proposition', 'director', 'Andrew', 'Dominick', 'who', 'helmed', 'Assassination', 'Jesse', 'James', 'Coward', 'Robert', 'Ford', 'one', 'finest', 'films', 'past', 'decade', 'excellent', 'actors', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'Scott', 'McNairy', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'Vincent', 'Curatola', 'are', 'fine', 'actors', 'execution', 'however', 'film', 'mixed', 'bag', 'slow', 'talky', 'existential', 'gangster', 'movie', 'very', 'blunt', 'political', 'satire', 'finished', 'product', 'nice', 'standout', 'scenes', 'dialogue', 'too', 'slow', 'too', 'muddled', 'be', 'considered', 'success.The', 'plot', 'centers', 'heist', 'poker', 'game', 'local', 'mafia', 'New', 'Orleans', 'economic', 'tailspin', 'run', 'up', '2008', 'presidential', 'election', 'Barack', 'Obama', 'Parallels', 'are', 'drawn', 'gangsters', 'movie', 'people', 'Wall', 'Street', 'Washington', 'who', 'perpetrated', 'housing', 'bubble', 'lead', 'economic', 'crash', 'Criminal', 'activity', 'up', 'money', 'quits', 'moving', 'similar', 'credit', 'shortage', 'attributed', 'banking', 'crash', 'Just', 'scene', 'talk', 'radio', 'CSPAN', 'background.A', 'few', 'individual', 'scenes', 'stand', 'out', 'heist', 'sequence', 'perfect', 'Gandolfini', 'scenes', 'somewhat', 'superfluous', 'overall', 'narrative', 'are', 'acted', 'authority', 'Gandolfini', 'really', 'fine', 'actor', 'scenes', 'gusto', 'drive', 'out', 'final', 'hit', 'quite', 'well', 'done', 'suspenseful.The', 'problem', 'individual', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'satisfying', 'whole', 'found', 'narrative', 'rather', 'slow', 'too', 'deliberately', 'paced', 'coming', 'guy', 'who', 'normally', 'when', 'film', 'time', 'political', 'subtext', 'not', 'really', 'subtext', 'considering', 'almost', 'continuously', 'background', 'scene', 'as', 'subtle', 'kick', 'teeth', 'Too', 'much', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'summed', 'up', 'aging', 'depressed', 'gangsters', 'discussing', 'things', 'bars', 'cars', 'hotel', 'rooms', 'political', 'talk', 'radio', 'CSPAN', 'run', 'background.If', ""'re"", 'gangster', 'movies', 'then', 'look', 'artistically', 'accomplished', 'frequently', 'quite', 'arresting', 'visually', 'painterly', 'compositions', 'Richard', 'Deakins', 'accomplished', 'Jesse', 'James', 'grit', 'grime', 'really', 'come', 'Dominick', 'obviously', 'talented', 'director', 'give', 'own', 'excesses', 'here', 'bit', 'too', 'much']",N/A

1591935,A6WZVL0SRQAPY,B009AMAL4Y,Brian Driver,"[11, 17]","For me, no two ways about it: this was bad.I wanted to like it.  I thought the cast was sharp (Brad Pitt, James Gandolfini, Ray Liotta, Richard Jenkins, Sam Shepard, Vincent Curatola, and a young actor I like named Scoot McNairy), the adaptation of novelist George V. Higgins' book sounded interesting, and the promising good reviews had come in from Cannes and elsewhere.  I was hoping to discount the low grumbling I'd heard from some of the few members of the general public who did make it to the theaters to see it.Yes, I hoped I was going to like it, and sure enough I felt the beginning of the movie was extremely promising.  I got the feeling it was trying to be all those gritty movies and cable shows one reveres--a latter-day ""Sopranos,"" or a grittier ""Goodfellas"" or even...dare I say it? A Tarantino-esque venture.I though maybe, just maybe there might be something here within the hard-to-like characters and the strange cadence of their conversations: not only between the dumb crooks who felt they could rip off other crooks, but also the ones between two other, sharper crooks who were called in to deal with the first guys.  Oh, good, I thought: a wise ""talkie"" crime film full of clever, realistic street dialogue and occasional shocking cruelty.And as it began I thought...how clever to set it in an unusual era (2008, during which a politically charged Senator Obama and sitting president George W. Bush trade their versions of the American dream).  How cleverly the words of politicians will serve as a counterpoint to the brutality in the words and deeds of the criminal element of these ""business"" men.Yeah...it's just that it didn't accomplish any of this.  At least not that I felt.  It was a dreary (constantly raining) and dismal film absent of anything that could remotely be thought of as snappy, clever dialogue.  There were a couple of really laughably vulgar comments (especially delivered by Gandolfini), but I didn't think those made it under anything close to wittiness.I didn't read Higgins' original work, but it had to be better laid out than this.  I didn't mind the rootless ugliness of having to do ""business"" this way, or the disappointing unfairness of having to do repulsive things, or even the poorly thought out pointlessness of the violent trade--I could take those things.  It was that there was nothing sharp or new about this film.Okay, I get it: this is a visceral world where bad things happen.  College types need not apply.  And I get the whole counterpoint of the election, too: that America is a business.  And I suppose it could be said that the empty ""charm"" of the politicians was in its own way hideous to the criminal element, too, right?No...that may be among the things this was trying to say, but it was dull as dishwater and had the subtlety of a hemorrhoid.  By the tired end of this tired movie I was tired of making excuses on its behalf.  Its dialogue was not witty; it just used a lot of crudity and brashness. I'm not a prude...I just believe there's a difference between good dialogue and bad, and vulgarity has its place among many great works.But this just wandered around, aimless.  It was like watching a bunch of guys argue for about an hour and a half.  There was action, and it came across as shocking (which it should), but it's a poor movie that simply depends on shock value in place of cleverness.  And sometimes it was stupid: why would a seasoned hit man shoot over the roof of his car at a mark who on the other side of his car?  I couldn't think of a worse ""advantage.""And the whole thing about America being a con game...there was such a sledge hammer approach to it as a symbol here that it may as well have had bells go off whenever the TV was blaring its message.  ""Here I am!"" it shouts...""I'm talking here!""  TV's ""Family Guy"" uses more nuance.Sorry, guys, I really wanted to like this.  I'm giving it three stars because, gosh, it DOES have this great cast.  I would love to love this film, but no.  I really didn't.  And, to top it all off, there was suddenly this point when it was abruptly...OVER.However, I probably shouldn't complain: like the grunts used to say about their military chow: ""It was awful and there was too little of it.""Maybe that's the one thing for which I should have thanked THEM.",2,Yuk.

Instead of the action gangster film that everyone was expecting we get a talky film that explores both the psyche of the modern gangster and the crumbling of the American economy and moral values.When three inept crooks rob a mob controlled card game things begin to go terribly wrong for them. Frankie(Scoot McNairy), Russell(Ben Mendelsohn) and Squirrel(Vincent Curatola)are small time crooks hoping to hit it big by robbing a mob card game run by Markie Trattman(Ray Liotta). This robbery forces retaliation by the mob in the form of an assassin named Jackie Cogan(Brad Pitt). Cogan perfers killing his victims softly (from a distance) without emotion. The film adds as a counterpoint to this story the fall of the American economy and the bheginning of the Obama administration, Dominik attributes this economic downfall to a collapse in a system based on gambling.The film does some things quite well: the dialogue is crisp and interesting throughout and the characters are well played and quirky enough to keep the viewer's interest. The biggest problem is that this is not an easy movie to follow and the plot moves along very slowly. If viewed as simply a crime thriller it is not thrilling. Dominik relies on his dialogue to explore the inner workings of the modern gangster and the viewer will learn much by carefully listening. In this way the film follows the style of David Mamet pretty closely. Dominik sees everything based on money. America is not a community as Obama states at the end. It has become a business nothing more or less.The Blu Ray edition presents the film with very few extras. There are four deleted scenes and a very short making of documentary.

In the movie, he reminds us that he's more than just a pretty face with a sultry voice. He plays Jackie Cogan, a man who has made a career of not being well known, the complete opposite of his real persona. Career saved!""Killing Them Softly"" may have big time actors like James Gandolfini, Ray Liotta and Brad Pitt, but the movie is as small as any other independent low budget film you may venture to see. Its premise centers around a culture of despair and desperation that has gripped our country. There is no musical soundtrack in the film. The tone of the film is captured with sound bites and clips of President's Barack Obama and George Bush, talking about hope and unity, all the while our country is falling farther and farther into economic ruin. With that ruin comes a new era of gangster, mob, crime mentality. With that ruin comes characters like Frankie and Russell, who are desperate enough to pull off a robbery just for a paycheck.Jackie Cogan is called in by a secret group of men who want to know who robbed their card game of $100,000 and want somebody to pay. Pitt pulls off Cogan's menacing charm with ease. He has to be somebody who is capable of awful things, but could easily friend you at the drop of a hat. Gandolfini is a fellow hit man who comes in because one of the jobs Cogan is asked to do is of a personal nature. While his character is interesting, his relevance becomes questionable and the two long talky scenes that he is in become even more troublesome.""Killing Them Softly"" is 100% independent film. It has a gangster movie type feel to it, but character exploration is at its heart. The scenes are real and effective. Although there are too many long scenes, most notably the scenes with Gandolfini that serve little to no purpose and weigh the film down. Yet, as I stated earlier, the Presidential sound bites that loom over the film are effective and add validity to a movie that probably wouldn't have been as good without them. When desperation becomes more prevalent and the people in charge are full of hot air, things and people happen. Despair is a very real thing and we have all become reliant upon paychecks and money.

1591951,A18D0R137EYS6C,B009AMAL4Y,Clinton Enlow,"[1, 1]","Watching Killing Them Softly was like my first attempt to read George Higgins Cogan's Trade. I picked up the book because of Andrew Dominick's involvement with a film adaptation and was a huge plus after Chopper and The Assassination of Jesse James. Cogan's Trade to say the least was an eye opening experience something that took me two tries to get the hang of Higgins use of dialogue using conversations to push plot over prose. In fact of the two books I've read his dialogue is more immersive than his descriptions of action. Higgins wasn't overburdening his novels with too much twists or overly complicated plot. Reading that much dialogue crammed into pages was dizzying to say the least something that translates to the film. There's not much action instead focusing on conversations of the characters instead. Higgins wasn't so much writing novels as plays in a way.In fact Cogan's Trade and Killing Them Softly both have a rather simple plot, something that fits with the original title that was unfortunately changed months before release. After a mob backed card game is held up by two punks working for an intermediate, the mob contacts hitman Jackie Cogan to put things right and get the card games back up and running. What procedes are a lot of conversations between Jackie, thiefs Frankie and Russel, and Mickey a killer flown in to kill a man who knows Cogan's reputation as a killer. Adapted from the book its all basically following the business of Cogan's Trade adorned with with a rather overbearing need to tie Cogan's killings with that of the current economic issues of 2008 when the film takes place.Other than the overkill with the films point one of the main problems of the film is it doesn't do much with the material which makes the characters suffer outside of Cogan who for those who enter the film cold comes across as ruthless but economical in how he handles his job. Frankie is too much of a simpering twit who Scoot Mcnairy does what He can with the character. Ben Mendhelson does a better job with the comic relief of strung out Russel and Ray Liotta adds some sympathy as Markie the gangster who has to be killed simply for his past transgressions.Dominik hasn't really changed much from the book. Every scene of the movie is mainly unchanged every conversation verbatim only adding a bit of cynicism with a conversation between Jenkins and Pitt at the finale. The financial crisis takes center stage too much so with every radio and television blaring news and talk radio in an effort that makes the political billboard at the start of the movie seem tame by comparison. Its overdone which makes another decision seem strange in changing the setting from Higgins Boston to New Orleans. Unlike the news which gives you a feel of time setting the film in New Orleans doesn't really work out for much as if you're not from the city you might really not notice much and the film doesn't do much with it making the change seem strange over pointed.What Dominik doesn't do with writing at least his direction is top notch in creating a grim and beautiful scneario. Theres humor that wasn't really in the book but scenes like a beating in a rain storm or a slowmotion execution are highlights for the films visual flair. The main holdup is exemplary in its suspense and the meetings between Jenkins and Pitt follow the main point of Higgins novel in making the act of killing come across as a business.The movie is a film that doesn't work well. Higgins novel that reads like a play works better in the intimate way reading a book can as Dominik doesn't really do much with the material outside of simple straight adaptation.

1591955,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B009AMAL4Y,C. Sawin,"[4, 6]","""Killing Them Softly"" is kind of like if Larry (Michael Pitt) and Tommy (Michael Stuhlbarg) had an entire movie to have entertaining conversations and screw up the entire time instead of being killed off in the opening scene of ""Seven Psychopaths."" Russell's little dog operation is very similar to the one Billy (Sam Rockwell) and Hans (Christopher Walken) are also a part of in ""Seven Psychopaths."" The opening credits of ""Killing Them Softly"" are unique yet extremely irritating. They cut back and forth between Frankie walking down a tunnel as Obama speaks and a black background with white text for the credits. The transition starts off slow at first, but becomes more and more frequent. It puts you on edge and maybe that's the point.The entire film revolves around really bizarre conversations. Think really off the wall type conversations not unlike those found in ""Seven Psychopaths"" or the more sex driven conversations between Mads Mikkelsen and Kim Bodnia in Nicholas Winding Refn's ""Pusher."" Every time two people are in a car, you should pay close attention because it's almost always entertaining. The humor is very dark and covers everything from sex to dish gloves to the economy and everything in between.One of the best examples of the humor in the film lies within the meaning of the title of the film. Jackie is having this conversation with the driver (Richard Jenkins) and Jackie asks him if he's ever killed anyone before saying some people get very ""touchy feely"" whenever they're about to die. Jackie then turns to the driver and says, ""They cry, they plead, they beg, they piss themselves, they cry for their mothers. It gets embarrassing. I like to kill 'em softly. From a distance.""There are some really fantastic camera techniques utilized in the film. When Jackie is first introduced, he gets out of his car and walks onto a construction site. The camera starts at his feet and slowly pans up to the back of his head as he walks. The camera is propped on the car door as Jackie gets in and out of the car in a scene near the end of the film. One of the most uniquely edited scenes is when Russell is talking to Frankie. After shooting up and being awake for a week straight, Russell begins going in and out of consciousness while he's talking and smoking a cigarette. What you see on screen is almost like the light at the end of a dark tunnel or when you squint your eyes in the bright sun.There is this really incredible beat down in the rain. The combination of the harsh sound effects, the puddles of blood, the angry assailants, and the helpless victim dancing clumsily in the pouring down rain makes you cringe a bit. The scene is the first real taste of violence in the film and it's so sudden that it almost takes your breath away. Slow motion also deserves a mention. Jackie's first kill is done in slow motion and it is just full of downright mayhem and destruction.You do wish there was a bit more to ""Killing Them Softly"" though. The ending is just magnificent as is the last speech given by one of the characters. It's some of the best written material to be put to film this year, but it would've been nice to have seen a bit more action and a little less talking. Everyone in the film listens to politics and it doesn't really all come together until that final scene. The biggest setback is that Mickey (James Gandolfini) is kind of pointless in the long run. Jackie and the driver make him useful, but it's done off-screen. In the meantime, Mickey is useless and does nothing but drink himself stupid and screw every hooker in town.Next to ""Lawless,"" ""Killing Them Softly"" is the other must-see mob related film you should go out of your way to see this year. You don't expect it to be as funny as it is, but it's also extremely intense. The film is like a lion stalking its prey. It slowly creeps up on you the entire film until it chooses to pounce and show its true colors.

1591956,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B009AMAL4Y,DanD,"[1, 3]","Firmly rooted in the recession of 2008, KILLING THEM SOFTLY is far from the action film it was unfortunately promoted as.  In fact, it's main attraction, Brad Pitt, doesn't even enter the picture until about 30 minutes, and isn't a key player until nearer the end.  It's not even a gangster film in the traditional style--the epic rise and fall of some ne'er-do-well.  It's an intensely intimate tale of two criminal idiots who get in over their heads, causing other people to take the fall for their crimes.  And it's about the people who come in and clean up the mess, all because these days, you gotta do what you gotta do to get a buck.Writer/director Andrew Dominik brings to SOFTLY the same slow-burning intensity he gave to THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES BY THE COWARD ROBERT FORD; but, being half that film's length, SOFTLY comes off as far more intense.  One scene in particular, where Ray Liotta's unfortunate Markie takes a beating, is especially difficult to watch; Dominik pulls no punches here in framing the brutality of the situation.  And yet, there's a surprising undertone of humor, centered largely around Richard Jenkins's unnamed character: he's a criminal of the new order, a bureaucratic middleman, and paired up against the more pragmatic Brad Pitt (""Now f***in' pay me""), he's a fish out of water.This is an actor's film; great turns are had by Sam Shepard, Scoot McNairy, Ben Mendelsohn, James Gandolfini, and especially the afore-mentioned Jenkins and Liotta (cast gloriously against type).  Pitt is the major attraction here, but his performance is so subtle and understated that no doubt many fans will be disappointed.  And yet, Pitt digs under your skin, and in the final scene, when he really cuts loose about the one thing that really matters--money--you sense how everything has been building to this moment.  Because, believe it or not, this is a gangster film about economics.  It's a gangster film about America; but instead of CASINO or SCARFACE or GOODFELLAS, it's about the side of America that we're used to, because to an extent, most of us have been there.  When they talk about films that encapsulate the early 21st century, and the shift in economy and politics, they will reference this film.  Which, perhaps, makes this an important little movie.  Give KILLING THEM SOFTLY a shot; if you have the patience to sit through it, the experience is rewarding, if a little off-putting at times.",4,"""I'm livin' in America, and in America you're on your own.

While this type of word rich cinematography works at times (""My Breakfast with Andre""), it seems badly out of place in an action film about hit men. Used sparingly (the DeNiro Pacino meeting in ""Heat"") these scenes can add to a film, but used as the main method of communication, they are risky.The film is not without some redeeming qualities. The acting is superb. Pitt, Gandolfino, Jenkins, Mendelsohn and Long all put in sterling performances. And the photography by Greig Fraser (""Snow White and the Huntsman"", ""Bright Star"") is excellent as are the special effects. And one can get some sense of ironic pleasure watching Ray Liotta take a beating, since we're used to him being on the opposite side of this interaction.In the end, the fault must be assigned to writer and director Andrew Dominik who fails to disengage from the one on one vignettes. This is only the third film for Dominick, and his last effort was also with Pitt (""The Assassination of Jesse James..."") and also suffered from an over abundance of words and an absence of action.In addition, Dominik's heavy-handed use of clips from the 2008 Presidential campaign do not serve to underscore his message (crime is business) but rather distract from what is otherwise an excellent display of acting.Bottom line - great acting and photography in search of a good film.

Mickey (Ray Liotta) runs the game, but already knocked over (robbed) his own game once before, leading to an implication that he did it once again.  Scott McNairy, Ben Mendelsohn, Richard Jenkins, James Gandolfini, and Vincent Curatola also star in supporting roles.At some point, a typical gangster film or television show will feature a gangster-run card game.  However, it typically ends with some kind of shootout - yet in this particular film, the robbers easily get away with the cash, but are simply too stupid to leave town after the deed.  What does all of this mean for this film?  It means it's a slow moving, realistic plot that has very little entertainment value until the end.  And, even in the end, the audience will easily see how the film is going by the end.The cast is one of the bright spots of the film.  Brad Pitt does a marvelous job (as usual), while Ray Liotta plays his typical gangster role dating back several years to Goodfellas.  We also see a bit of a Sopranos reunion with James Gandolfini - in a very unusual role - along with Vincent Curatola, and Max Casella, even though none of them have any scenes together.  In the end, it's Scoot McNairy and Ben Mendelsohn who really steal the show in this one.  Their scatterbrained/humorous exchanges are about the only thing stopping you from falling asleep.Overall, this makes for a tough date night film to sit through - unless you're a gangster enthusiast.  Running at just over 90 minutes, it will feel like 3 hours, but don't mistake this for a bad film because it's not date night worthy.

1591995,A24PMZJF0LHGCW,B009AMAL4Y,Gilby Mitnick III Jr.,"[4, 10]","I am happy that Killing Them Softly is a vehicle that finally...finally...sees Brad Pitt in a starring role, which is so rare because he has only been in Happy Feet 2, Moneyball, The Tree of Life, Megamind, Inglorious Basterds and The Curious Life of Ben Buttons in just the last couple of years. I'm happy that he will finally have some more cash in his pocket to help feed his wifey, Angelina Jolley. With Xmas coming up, I know how hard it can be for high-earning, Hollywood actors to still feed their wifeys...so I'm happy for his career boost!Killing Them Softly is, first of all, a totally original work, as demonstrated by the fact that the director like totally s/to/l/e the story from the 1974 George 5 Higgins novella. In this highly original movie, Pitt performs the role of a professional enforcer (read: hitman, but not like Bret the Hitman Hart) by the name of Jackie Coogan. I was originally confused at the naming of the character because Jackie is obviously a name reserved exclusively for the skirts, and Pitt may be a little bit foppish, but he is definitely no dame. Anyhoo, the Pittster as Jackie (girl name) Coogan investigates a heist--which I think is a highfalutin way of saying ""robbery""--that happens to happen while a mob-guarded poker game of high stakes is underway! Whew! Just writing that brief summary gave me the runs because it was so action-packed.Even though this movie is a great example of a modern-day thriller with a bit of a crime caper thrown in, there were parts that just left me cold and ungratified. For instance, during the mob-enforced poker game, because the mob is Italian, all the poker players are seen gorging themselves on Olive Garden takeout food! I never felt so offended in my life at a blatant case of ethnic stereotyping in the movies! Porca miseria, I say, porca miseria! Mama mia...Another portion of the movie that still sits funny in the pit of my stomach is--again, keep in mind that the plot revolves around the Italian mob--a scene when Pitt and James Gandolfini (played by Will Sa/s/s/o) pose as construction workers to further their investigation. Even though they are supposed to be undercover, they start catcalling and whistling as pretty girls whenever they walk by them!! That is heinous stereotyping of swarthy, Italian-American construction workers and what their behavior may or may not be when pretty girls sashay past them with arched backs! Porca miseria, I say, porca miseria!",5,K/i/l/l Me Harder!!!

1591998,A328S9RN3U5M68,B009AMAL4Y,Grady Harp,"[2, 3]","Andrew Dominik's screenplay and direction of George V. Higgins' novel `Cogan's Trade' may have to search for the right audience because it is a complexly designed and performed piece of cinema.  But for those who are willing to step into a different stratosphere of combining gangland antics and brutality with a strong subtext of commentary on the current status of American political system - a film packed with some top notch performances by a varied set of actors - then spend some time with KILLING THEM SOFTLY. The title comes from the main character professional hitman Jackie Cogan who confides that he likes to carry out his missions without getting to close to the victims so that he doesn't have to hear their whining and pleas and crying etc as he kills them - distance allows him to kill them softly.We learn that Markie (Ray Liotta) some years back made a lot of money by raiding a gambling game.  Since it worked before, odds are that it will work again now that Markie is out and in the mob controlled gambling scene. Some amateurs (Scoot McNairy and Ben Mendelsohn, both losers on heroin) are hired by Johnny Amato (Vincent Curatola) to stickup a mob protected card game, causing the local criminal economy to collapse. Jackie Cogan (Brad Pitt) is an enforcer for the Mob and is called in by an unnamed driver (Richard Jenkins) who is brokering the deal to track them down and restore order to the local criminal economy. Cogan demands that an assistant Mickey (James Gandolfini) be brought in, but when Mickey arrives in town he is far more interested in prostitutes and staying drunk than doing his job. How the final plan to correct the problem is carried out is the rapid-fire sequence of the last part of the film and to spoil it would be a shame.In many ways the movie is a recreation of the 2008 financial crisis - each character represents a different contemporary type (e.g., Richard Jenkins is the American government, etc). Under much of the dialogue for the film is the presence of political television shows with Bush and Obama talking, underlining the 2008 financial crisis, and that adds to the veracity of the story.  The actors are excellent, the action is a bit on the gory side, but the seemingly endless and roaming dialogue holds a lot of viewpoints that are salient and make these underbelly jerks credible.  You simply have to be in the mood for this one.

But as an entry in the 'Gangster"" genre, it is rock-bottom BORING. I actually enjoyed seeing many of the actors in this film, such as Pitt, Gandolfini, Liotta. It was also nice to see Vincent Curatola, who is known to fans of this genre as Johnny 'Sack"", a regular on the SOPRANOS. (It would have been nice to see he and Gandolfini in a scene together, just for nostalgia's sake.) However, watching these actors do their thing was not enough to make up for how slow and draggy this sleeper is. It is a political statement disguised as a gangster film.

now....It had potential, but fell short of the mark for a truly great piece of work....HOWEVER, I contend that this film will have more of an influential impactin this genre, as well as, on how future gangster-action-thriller films are done.If you take certain scenes for what they brought cinematically, stylistically & content-wise;like the brutal beat down of Ray Liotta's crooked con man, Markie, by the two thugsfor running the fixed card game gone awry...Man, that is an amazing scene!It is so real and evocative of what you may hear thuggish-types in big cities likeNYC, Boston, & Philly, etc., call &#34;throwing (someone) a beatin' &#34;.They beat Liotta's character almost until he's begging for death!(It's gripping to watch!)Then, there are the &#34;dirty deeds&#34; scenes whereBrad Pitt's sleek-shrewd-ice-cold mob hit man, Jackie Coogan, does his thing!That slo-mo bloody death scene that he and Liotta created is part poetry,part perverse ballet, and part gore-fest!I find it to be absolutely one of the most original, riveting & compelling death scenesthat I've seen in a film in a long time!This is what I mean by its impact will be more influentialto filmmakers who take on this genre in the future.Then, there was the double bloody shotgun / handgundouble-cross killing scenes that Coogan carries out with themater-of-fact aloofness, and clinical sensibilities of a surgeon transplanting a vital organ!There are a few other great scenes in the film that escape meright now at this late hour, but like I said earlier, their impact and influencewith reverberate in the future.I predict that &#34;Killing Me Softly&#34; will get its props, 5 to 10 years from now,when some as-yet-unknown actor and director will create a future masterpiecein this genre, and reference &#34;Killing Them Softly&#34; as a main influence.Then people will go back a re-discover it, and say &#34;Ohhh, Okay!&#34;That my opinion anywayz!This is an okay film though....not great as it could've been....but not complete trash either.",3,The Future Will Exonerate & Re-Evaluate This Film For Its Influence!!,1384560000,"11 16, 2013",2013,3575,"['Lot', 'People', 'Were', 'Disappointed', 'FilmBecause', 'Was', 'Represented', 'Something', ""Wasn't.They"", 'expected', 'rollicking', 'gangster', 'action-crime', 'would', 'rival', 'many', 'others', 'have', 'gone', 'downin', 'movie', 'history', 'great', 'films.The', 'deceitful', 'movie', 'company', 'marketing', 'teams', 'knew', 'long', 'felt', 'had', 'create', 'sort', 'hype', 'get', 'viewers', 'theater', 'seats.People', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'being', 'toyed', 'bitterly', 'stayed', 'away', 'itafter', 'initial', 'opening', 'week', 'revealed', 'hoax', 'what', 'was', 'most', 'definitely', 'had', 'cast', 'make', 'film', 'happen', 'producers', 'writers', 'directors', 'opted', 'take', 'usin', 'little', 'different', 'direction', 'stylistically', 'flow-wise', 'think', 'really', 'threw', 'people', 'loop', 'whenthey', 'saw', 'not', 'good', 'way', 'When', 'saw', 'theaters', 'saw', 'peopleactually', 'walking', 'out', '30', '45', 'minutes', 'film', 'cursing', 'screen', 'wanting', 'money', 'back', 'stayed', 'credits', 'rolled', 'felt', 'was', 'missing', 'certain', 'elementsthat', 'could', ""'ve"", 'made', 'great', 'film.Since', 'then', ""'ve"", 'rented', 'Red', 'Box', 'just', 'make', 'sure', ""wasn'tmaking"", 'snap', 'judgment', 'just', 'becauseit', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'criteria', 'what', 'thought', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been.In', 'viewing', 'further', 'analysis', 'beencoming', 'Showtime', 'quite', 'regularly', 'last', 'month', 'so', 'lead', 'reassess', 'initial', 'opinion.Now', 'hear', 'out', 'bind', 'burn', 'alive', 'public', 'square', 'midnight', 'Here', 'what', 'say', '34', 'Killing', 'Them', 'Softly', '34', 'now', '.It', 'had', 'potential', 'fell', 'short', 'mark', 'truly', 'great', 'piece', 'work', '.HOWEVER', 'contend', 'film', 'will', 'have', 'more', 'influential', 'impactin', 'genre', 'as', 'well', 'how', 'future', 'gangster-action-thriller', 'films', 'are', 'done.If', 'take', 'certain', 'scenes', 'what', 'brought', 'cinematically', 'stylistically', 'content-wise', 'brutal', 'beat', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'crooked', 'con', 'man', 'Markie', 'two', 'thugsfor', 'running', 'fixed', 'card', 'game', 'gone', 'awry', 'Man', 'amazing', 'scene', 'so', 'real', 'evocative', 'what', 'may', 'hear', 'thuggish-types', 'big', 'cities', 'likeNYC', 'Boston', 'Philly', 'etc.', 'call', '34', 'throwing', 'someone', 'beatin', '34', '.They', 'beat', 'Liotta', 'character', 'almost', 'begging', 'death', 'gripping', 'watch', 'Then', 'are', '34', 'dirty', '34', 'scenes', 'whereBrad', 'Pitt', 'sleek-shrewd-ice-cold', 'mob', 'hit', 'man', 'Jackie', 'Coogan', 'thing', 'slo-mo', 'bloody', 'death', 'scene', 'Liotta', 'created', 'part', 'poetry', 'part', 'perverse', 'ballet', 'part', 'gore-fest', 'find', 'be', 'absolutely', 'one', 'most', 'original', 'riveting', 'compelling', 'death', 'scenesthat', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'long', 'time', 'what', 'mean', 'impact', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'influentialto', 'filmmakers', 'who', 'take', 'genre', 'future.Then', 'was', 'double', 'bloody', 'shotgun', '/', 'handgundouble-cross', 'killing', 'scenes', 'Coogan', 'out', 'themater-of-fact', 'aloofness', 'clinical', 'sensibilities', 'surgeon', 'transplanting', 'vital', 'organ', 'are', 'few', 'other', 'great', 'scenes', 'film', 'escape', 'meright', 'now', 'late', 'hour', 'said', 'earlier', 'impact', 'influencewith', 'reverberate', 'future.I', 'predict', '34', 'Killing', 'Me', 'Softly', '34', 'will', 'get', 'props', '5', '10', 'years', 'now', 'when', 'as-yet-unknown', 'actor', 'director', 'will', 'create', 'future', 'masterpiecein', 'genre', 'reference', '34', 'Killing', 'Them', 'Softly', '34', 'main', 'influence.Then', 'people', 'will', 'go', 'back', 're-discover', 'say', '34', 'Ohhh', 'Okay', '34', 'opinion', 'anywayz', 'okay', 'film', '.not', 'great', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'not', 'complete', 'trash']",N/A
1592006,A25GMONBLGQE1U,B009AMAL4Y,"H. Ross ""biblemonkey""","[2, 3]","A mob card game is robbed, a wise guy is framed, and a hit man is called to deal with it. I admit, on the surface this doesn't seem too appealing. More of the same, right? Maybe not.Ray Liotta plays ""Markie,"" a mob-connected wise guy who admitted once to robbing his own high stakes poker game. Everybody likes Markie, so no one turned on him, but tensions are a little high. When someone gets the bright idea to rob another of Markie's card games and frame him for it, it seems like the perfect plan. Nobody really trusts Markie anymore, and they'd obviously think he did it again. Unfortunately, loose lips lead to the truth, and hits are ordered.Enter Brad Pitt as a ""seen it all"" hit man who likes to ""kill `em softly."" He doesn't like all the blubbering and pleading that contract victims usually throw out. It's too emotional, too messy. He prefers to hit from an emotional distance and let the mark have at least a moment of peace before he takes a life. Will he really kill Markie just to send a message? Will he turn on the young men who were tricked into robbing the card game? Or will he look into his own dark heart and find a shred of humanity and mercy for his intended victims?The answers are not all obvious, and they are not all correct, no matter how you guess from the very beginning. This is a classic noir film wrapped in a mob movie. Our lead is an anti-hero, but not in the vein becoming popular with shows like ""Breaking Bad"" or ""Boardwalk Empire,"" not that those shows are lacking for good acting and writing. This is an old style anti-hero. One who you can tell is not weighed and worried or fighting his inner darkness, but is truly just ""doing his job"" and has seen so much that his heart may be more stone than human.Pitt gives a better performance here than we have seen from him since Ocean's 11, but don't mistake that for him playing to that same type. This character is entirely on his own, and no comparison should be drawn to his other roles, as you won't be able to find one. Liotta is vulnerable and sweet, but still slimy enough that you can see why folks would simultaneously forgive and condemn his ""Markie."" Scoot McNairy and Ben Mendelsohn as the two rookie thieves are so natural that I could not even tell that they were acting during any scene they were in. Here are two guys that should be given a chance to play a different type in an upcoming feature and see what they can do. The late James Gandolfini's character in this movie is literally a throw-away character in that he has no impact on the story, but honestly I cannot fault the inclusion. His character added a richness and depth to the world the movie takes place in, and he is at the same time so repulsive and so pitiable that you just want to smack him and then immediately give him a hug and say you didn't mean it. He's like a giant child who is lashing out from his pain, but just wants you to hold him and tell him it is all going to be OK.""Killing Them Softly"" is not for everyone. It is stylized and odd instead of spelling things out for you. It is slow and calculated and has long stretches of dialogue that seemingly go nowhere. It is full of violence, but no ""action."" There are really no characters to like, as they are all dirty, selfish people. It plays out against the 2008 American Presidential elections but makes no social commentary on either political party, instead rather waiting until literally the last minute to say anything about the cynical and harsh views its characters have on the country's condition. All these things, however, work in the movie's favor. If you can just go for the ride and give the movie a chance as a ""story"" rather than a ""moral,"" you will find a return to noir for the modern audience.",4,Violence With A Brain,1381708800,"10 14, 2013",2013,3747,"['mob', 'card', 'game', 'robbed', 'wise', 'guy', 'framed', 'hit', 'man', 'called', 'deal', 'admit', 'surface', ""n't"", 'seem', 'too', 'appealing', 'More', 'same', 'right', 'Maybe', 'not.Ray', 'Liotta', 'Markie', 'mob-connected', 'wise', 'guy', 'who', 'admitted', 'once', 'robbing', 'own', 'high', 'stakes', 'poker', 'game', 'Everybody', 'Markie', 'one', 'turned', 'tensions', 'are', 'little', 'high', 'When', 'someone', 'bright', 'idea', 'rob', 'Markie', 'card', 'games', 'frame', 'perfect', 'plan', 'Nobody', 'really', 'Markie', 'anymore', ""'d"", 'obviously', 'think', 'did', 'again', 'Unfortunately', 'loose', 'lips', 'lead', 'truth', 'hits', 'are', 'ordered.Enter', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'seen', 'hit', 'man', 'who', 'kill', 'em', 'softly', ""n't"", 'like', 'blubbering', 'pleading', 'contract', 'victims', 'usually', 'throw', 'out', 'too', 'emotional', 'too', 'messy', 'hit', 'emotional', 'distance', 'let', 'mark', 'have', 'least', 'moment', 'peace', 'life', 'Will', 'really', 'kill', 'Markie', 'just', 'send', 'message', 'Will', 'turn', 'young', 'men', 'who', 'were', 'tricked', 'robbing', 'card', 'game', 'will', 'look', 'own', 'dark', 'heart', 'find', 'shred', 'humanity', 'mercy', 'intended', 'victims', 'answers', 'are', 'not', 'obvious', 'are', 'not', 'correct', 'matter', 'how', 'guess', 'very', 'beginning', 'classic', 'noir', 'film', 'wrapped', 'mob', 'movie', 'lead', 'anti-hero', 'not', 'vein', 'becoming', 'popular', 'shows', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'Boardwalk', 'Empire', 'not', 'shows', 'are', 'lacking', 'good', 'acting', 'writing', 'old', 'style', 'anti-hero', 'One', 'who', 'can', 'tell', 'not', 'weighed', 'worried', 'fighting', 'inner', 'darkness', 'truly', 'just', 'doing', 'job', 'seen', 'so', 'much', 'heart', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'stone', 'human.Pitt', 'better', 'performance', 'here', 'have', 'seen', 'Ocean', '11', 'do', ""n't"", 'mistake', 'playing', 'same', 'type', 'character', 'entirely', 'own', 'comparison', 'should', 'be', 'drawn', 'other', 'roles', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'find', 'one', 'Liotta', 'vulnerable', 'sweet', 'still', 'slimy', 'enough', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'folks', 'would', 'simultaneously', 'forgive', 'condemn', 'Markie', 'Scoot', 'McNairy', 'Ben', 'Mendelsohn', 'two', 'rookie', 'thieves', 'are', 'so', 'natural', 'could', 'not', 'even', 'tell', 'were', 'acting', 'scene', 'were', 'Here', 'are', 'two', 'guys', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'chance', 'play', 'different', 'type', 'upcoming', 'feature', 'see', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'late', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'character', 'movie', 'literally', 'throw-away', 'character', 'impact', 'story', 'honestly', 'can', 'not', 'fault', 'inclusion', 'character', 'added', 'richness', 'depth', 'world', 'movie', 'place', 'same', 'time', 'so', 'repulsive', 'so', 'pitiable', 'just', 'want', 'smack', 'then', 'immediately', 'give', 'hug', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'mean', 'giant', 'child', 'who', 'lashing', 'out', 'pain', 'just', 'hold', 'tell', 'going', 'be', 'OK.', 'Killing', 'Them', 'Softly', 'not', 'everyone', 'stylized', 'odd', 'instead', 'spelling', 'things', 'out', 'slow', 'calculated', 'long', 'stretches', 'dialogue', 'seemingly', 'go', 'nowhere', 'full', 'violence', 'action', 'are', 'really', 'characters', 'like', 'are', 'dirty', 'selfish', 'people', 'out', '2008', 'American', 'Presidential', 'elections', 'social', 'commentary', 'political', 'party', 'instead', 'rather', 'waiting', 'literally', 'last', 'minute', 'say', 'anything', 'cynical', 'harsh', 'views', 'characters', 'have', 'country', 'condition', 'things', 'however', 'work', 'movie', 'favor', 'can', 'just', 'go', 'ride', 'give', 'movie', 'chance', 'story', 'rather', 'moral', 'will', 'find', 'return', 'noir', 'modern', 'audience']",N/A

1592012,A1SVYMPTQSA8AD,B009AMAL4Y,J. Battle,"[1, 2]","Killing Them Softly is the best genre entry since Road to Perdition or the Departed. The film shares a similar mood to Jackie Brown with it's insightful dialogue and it's quasi- retro appeal. Also it sports a great ensemble cast which the screenplay does not let go to waste. Although Brad Pitt is the marquee name associated with the movie he is merely given a complimentary role. The unsung actors are actually the central focus of this film and they turn in terrific performances. The film builds slowly, lunges at you, then regains it's composure. This awkward pacing is offset by exceptional character development and attention to detail. THE VIOLENCE IN THIS MOVIE IS THE MOST GRAPHICALLY DEPICTED OF ANY MAIN STREAM RELEASE THAT I CAN REMEMBER.

It has dialog, and if you wonder for just a moment, you will miss the bigger picture.

The long interludes between Jackie and Mickey are amusing, even if they seem out of place, they drive the plot just as assuredly as did the poker game heist and the 2008 presidential campaign and economic crash that was ever prevalent in the background. Brief, unglorified moments of violence are all that is to be seen here. The true focus is the story and dialog between the characters itself.

1592029,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B009AMAL4Y,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[2, 2]","Writer/director Andrew Dominik proved himself a visual poet when he made The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford in 2007. That film, also starring Brad Pitt, was a masterpiece and I had high hopes for Killing Them Softly. After all, it's based on the novel Cogan's Trade by George V. Higgins who also wrote The Friends of Eddie Coyle, which was adapted into a terrific 1973 film. What could go wrong? Well, critics have mostly been warm to the film but it's been met with scorn by audiences. Is it the masterpiece I expected from Dominik? No. Is it subtle? Most definitely not. But is there much to admire about it? Certainly.The film opens with Frankie (Scoot McNairy), obviously distressed, walking through a New Orleans-area wasteland while clips of a speech by then-Senator Barack Obama play on the soundtrack. The setting is election year 2008 as the country is experiencing an economic downturn. Frankie and his perpetually sweaty, Australian business associate Russell (Ben Mendelsohn) are low-level thugs recruited by Johnny ""Squirrel"" Amato (Vincent Curatola) to knock over a card game. Frankie is skittish about the job, pointing out that they'll all be murdered if they do it, until Squirrel reveals the game is run by Markie Trattman (Ray Liotta). Years ago, Markie had orchestrated the robbery of one of his games and gotten away with it. Now it's common knowledge that he was responsible and if another one of his games is knocked over, he'll be suspect and take the fall. Things initially go well for the robbers, but when hitman Jackie Cogan (Pitt) arrives he doesn't believe everything went down exactly as it appears. Political speeches by both George W. Bush and Obama are featured prominently throughout the film, particularly speeches regarding money and the economy.Killing Them Softly appears to be a straight-forward crime thriller, but has nearly wall-to-wall dialogue and grander ideas than that genre suggests. In inserting these speeches into the film with absolutely zero subtlety, we have Dominik paralleling the collapse of the U.S. economy with the collapse of the economy within the crime world. Killing Them Softly is certainly stylish, but with such a heavy-handed allegory, it seems to be grasping for substance. It doesn't lack substance per se; there's some strong dialogue with great depth, but the film lacks some vague essential element.Cinematographer Greig Fraser employs a muted color palette that makes New Orleans look like a post-apocalyptic wasteland. It's not as visually intriguing as The Assassination of Jesse James, but the visual prowess adds to the film's effect. During breaks from dialogue, the film does become ultra-violent and it does so in a visually interesting way. There's a scene where a character is brutally beaten and the way Dominik illustrates the brutality makes it hard to stomach. A subsequent murder scene is shown in ultra-slow motion and it's a work of visual panache and artistry. The look and tone established by the photography moves the film along better than the characters and dialogue do.Every performance here is strong, but none are Oscar-worthy. Pitt's cool, mature performance continues his streak of quality performances in mostly quality films. There is an element of typecasting that works in the film's favor, particularly in regards to Liotta and James Gandolfini as Jackie's troubled hitman friend Mickey, allowing the film to establish the persona of the characters without giving too much back story. Mendelsohn meanwhile nearly steals the show from his more well-known peers as the unreliable junkie Russell.Like much of the film the dialogue is heavy-handed, but it's very strong, specifically in the closing scene. The final lines spoken by Pitt make Dominik's point loud and clear and the lines themselves are startling and powerful, yet the ending doesn't quite work either. In many ways, Killing Them Softly feels incomplete; like small pieces of a larger masterpiece. The original cut was two and a half hours, while the final cut runs just over 90 minutes. I didn't know this beforehand and I still sensed the film may have been missing crucial scenes. There's a distinct lack of development in terms of plot and character that some of the missing scenes may have restored and the lack of proper build-up makes some scenes that should have had an impact simply hit the wall. Take the Mickey character for example. He arrives and shows more of an interest in prostitutes and booze than the job he came to do, but then his character's gone with a simple explanation. Perhaps his character had some contribution or meaning within the longer cut, but here he seems like filler. His character serves no purpose, except maybe to show that Jackie has empathy for people. However, that was established in his ""I like to kill them softly"" monologue, so (great as Gandolfini is) Mickey is a frivolous character.There are things to appreciate about Killing Them Softly but the stylish scenes of mayhem would be much more powerful with a stronger film surrounding them. It is imperfect, but I can't escape the feeling that a better film exists in there somewhere. Because it aspires to be more than a simple crime thriller there will be those who hail it as a masterpiece, but I'm unable to ignore its shortcomings. I know there's a fine film within Killing Them Softly, this just isn't it.",3,"Stylish, But Underwhelming",1357171200,"01 3, 2013",2013,5400,"['Writer/director', 'Andrew', 'Dominik', 'proved',

Their take on that bit of tradition I felt stripped bare the heroic images to reveal immature young men walking the edges of sanity.  Killing Them Softly did reveal some immature not-so-young men walking the edges of insanity. It also seemed to be comparing Brad Pitt's hit man, who prefers to kill them softly (not close up and personal), with government CEOs and banker ""hit men"" who wipe out the poor (including the poor ignorant bastards trying to make money off their heist in this film) from a distance.  But the metaphor doesn't quite come off and the violence is overdone for my sensibilities.

1592031,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B009AMAL4Y,J. Richardson,"[0, 1]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.Wow. This has to be the third or fourth movie in a row that was completely different than what I anticipated. Then again I'm not sure what I was expecting since I knew very little information going in. Which is making it hard for me to come up with a solid introduction to this review so I'll just jump right into it.Now if I would try to summarize the plot it would be a spoiler fest because this movie moves at a very fast pace and gives the viewer little to no breathing room (I'll get into that later). A few years ago a man by the name of Markie Trattman (Ray Liotta) decided to pay a couple of guys to rob his own poker game in an attempt to get a little extra money. When questioned (or should I say beaten in his own house) if he was involved, he denied it. Then when the games started back up he admitted it to a different group of guys that weren't there that night. That's where our first three characters come in.Johnny ""Squirrel"" Amatto (Vince Curatola) decides to hire two men, Frankie (Scoot McNairy) & Russell (Ben Mendelsohn), to rob Markie's next poker game. The way he sees it all fingers will point directly to Markie since he did it before and everyone involved would get off scot-free. Well he was partially right as Driver (Richard Jenkins) hires a hitman by the name of Jackie Cogan (Brad Pitt) to help take care of the problem. The only difference is Jackie knows Markie wasn't involved because, let's face it, no one is that stupid. However, he still feels that he needs to be taken out to prove a point. So his job is to find out who is responsible and to make them pay.I'll leave it at that so as not to give the entire thing away, but this is essentially a pure crime film from start to finish. I'm not one to watch mob films, but I found this one to be enjoyable. There was a solid list of interesting characters, there was a strong script, and there was a great cast. That doesn't mean that the movie is without its flaws though. As I mentioned before the film doesn't give you a lot of breathing room so, for me, Killing Them Softly's biggest downfall is its pacing. There's a pretty extensive list of characters (some of which only appear once or twice) so it could be difficult to follow along at first as you jump from scene to scene.Which brings me to my next point, the character development in this film is atrocious. We know absolutely nothing about these characters other than their names. With Mickey (James Gandolfini) being the only exception, but that's because he never shuts up. I understand that this is normal for movies like this to focus on the here and now and less on the past unless it relates to the overall story, but it makes all the characters feel like empty shells. The only character I felt for was Frankie, but even then it wasn't anything more than pity.With that said I think the cast more than makes up for the rough patches that can be found here.The way I see it the directors wanted the general audience to believe that Jackie is the main character, but I had a hard time believing that when 1) He doesn't come in until about 25 minutes into the movie and 2) In comparison with the rest of the cast he doesn't seem all that important. His role is essential to the story, but his character isn't (if that makes any sense). Everyone feels kind of balanced which maybe adds to the feeling that something just feels off. With that said, no matter who the main character is supposed to be it's no exaggeration when I say that everyone involved did a phenomenal job. Usually you have that one person who underperforms, but, in my opinion, they all delivered.Overall Score: 7.5/10 - Killing Them Softly is one of those rare instances where I felt conflicted with how I felt about the overall experience  It's not a bad film, but at the same time I don't feel like it truly went anywhere. As I said before what really kept me watching was how well-rounded the cast was and how well everyone performed. If you were to ask me this won't go down as one of the most beloved films ever created, but I can see it creating a strong cult following. If you're a fan of crime films or you just have an hour and a half to kill I would say give it a shot. It's probably not for your average Joe who likes a crazy amount of CGI and special effects, but I think film lovers will be able to find something worthwhile in the experience.",4,7.5/10 - Good,1367193600,"04 29, 2013",2013,4428,"['Note', 'May', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'Proceed', 'caution.Wow', 'be', 'third', 'fourth', 'movie', 'row', 'was', 'completely', 'different', 'what', 'anticipated', 'Then', 'again', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'knew', 'very', 'little', 'information', 'going', 'Which', 'making', 'hard', 'come', 'up', 'solid', 'introduction', 'review', 'so', ""'ll"", 'just', 'jump', 'right', 'it.Now', 'would', 'try', 'summarize', 'plot', 'would', 'be', 'spoiler', 'fest', 'movie', 'very', 'fast', 'pace', 'viewer', 'little', 'breathing', 'room', ""'ll"", 'get', 'later', 'few', 'years', 'man', 'name', 'Markie', 'Trattman', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'decided', 'pay', 'couple', 'guys', 'rob', 'own', 'poker', 'game', 'attempt', 'get', 'little', 'extra', 'money', 'When', 'questioned', 'should', 'say', 'beaten', 'own', 'house', 'was', 'involved', 'denied', 'Then', 'when', 'games', 'started', 'back', 'admitted', 'different', 'group', 'guys', 'were', ""n't"", 'there', 'night', 'where', 'first', 'three', 'characters', 'come', 'in.Johnny', 'Squirrel', 'Amatto', 'Vince', 'Curatola', 'hire', 'two', 'men', 'Frankie', 'Scoot', 'McNairy', 'Russell', 'Ben', 'Mendelsohn', 'rob', 'Markie', 'next', 'poker', 'game', 'way', 'fingers', 'will', 'point', 'directly', 'Markie', 'did', 'everyone', 'involved', 'would', 'get', 'off', 'scot-free', 'Well', 'was', 'partially', 'right', 'Driver', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'hitman', 'name', 'Jackie', 'Cogan', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'help', 'take', 'care', 'problem', 'only', 'difference', 'Jackie', 'knows', 'Markie', 'was', ""n't"", 'involved', 'because', 'let', 'face', 'one', 'stupid', 'However', 'still', 'be', 'taken', 'out', 'prove', 'point', 'job', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'responsible', 'make', 'pay.I', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'so', 'not', 'give', 'entire', 'thing', 'away', 'essentially', 'pure', 'crime', 'film', 'start', 'finish', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'watch', 'mob', 'films', 'found', 'one', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'was', 'solid', 'list', 'interesting', 'characters', 'was', 'strong', 'script', 'there', 'was', 'great', 'cast', ""n't"", 'mean', 'movie', 'flaws', 'though', 'mentioned', 'film', ""n't"", 'give', 'lot', 'breathing', 'room', 'so', 'Killing', 'Them', 'Softly', 'biggest', 'downfall', 'pacing', 'pretty', 'extensive', 'list', 'characters', 'only', 'appear', 'once', 'twice', 'could', 'be', 'difficult', 'follow', 'along', 'first', 'jump', 'scene', 'scene.Which', 'brings', 'next', 'point', 'character', 'development', 'film', 'atrocious', 'know', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'characters', 'other', 'names', 'Mickey', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'being', 'only', 'exception', 'never', 'up', 'understand', 'normal', 'movies', 'focus', 'here', 'now', 'less', 'past', 'overall', 'story', 'characters', 'feel', 'empty', 'shells', 'only', 'character', 'felt', 'was', 'Frankie', 'even', 'then', 'was', ""n't"", 'anything', 'more', 'pity.With', 'said', 'think', 'cast', 'more', 'up', 'rough', 'patches', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'here.The', 'way', 'see', 'directors', 'wanted', 'general', 'audience', 'believe', 'Jackie', 'main', 'character', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'believing', 'when', '1', ""n't"", 'come', '25', 'minutes', 'movie', '2', 'comparison', 'rest', 'cast', ""n't"", 'seem', 'important', 'role', 'essential', 'story', 'character', ""n't"", 'sense', 'Everyone', 'feels', 'kind', 'balanced', 'maybe', 'feeling', 'something', 'just', 'feels', 'off', 'said', 'matter', 'who', 'main', 'character', 'supposed', 'be', 'exaggeration', 'when', 'say', 'everyone', 'involved', 'did', 'phenomenal', 'job', 'Usually', 'have', 'one', 'person', 'who', 'opinion', 'delivered.Overall', 'Score', '7.5/10', 'Killing', 'Them', 'Softly', 'one', 'rare', 'instances', 'where', 'felt', 'conflicted', 'how', 'felt', 'overall', 'experience', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'same', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'truly', 'went', 'anywhere', 'said', 'what', 'really', 'kept', 'watching', 'was', 'how', 'well-rounded', 'cast', 'was', 'how', 'well', 'everyone', 'performed', 'were', 'ask', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'down', 'as', 'one', 'most', 'beloved', 'films', 'ever', 'created', 'can', 'see', 'creating', 'strong', 'cult', 'following', ""'re"", 'fan', 'crime', 'films', 'just', 'have', 'hour', 'half', 'kill', 'would', 'say', 'give', 'shot', 'probably', 'not', 'average', 'Joe', 'who', 'crazy', 'amount', 'CGI', 'special', 'effects', 'think', 'film', 'lovers', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'find', 'something', 'worthwhile', 'experience']",N/A

1592056,ABE8YHLYSM15G,B009AMAL4Y,Luke Killion,"[1, 2]","""Killing them Softly"" is a 2012 drama about underworld payback. Directed by Andrew Dominik, this film exists in a bleak and run down city of small time operators. Alot of the imagery for this movie is compelling; Domenik uses urban decay as the backdrop to paint a picture that corresponds with the picture's main metaphor: a parallel between the heist of a mob run poker game and the fiscal crisis of 2008. As the heist unfolds near the beginning of the movie, a television can be heard in the deathly silent room, spouting off media analysis of financial woe.This theme is also brought back into play at the very conclusion of the movie, with Brad Pitt's (Cogan) cynical jibes at the failed economy and smooth talking politicians who attmept to remedy the situaion. Personally, I thought some of this commentary to be a little forced; I thought this picture was far too short to attempt a viable metaphor of the stock market crash of 2008. Dominik came to this stylistic choice because he thought illegal gambling as portrayed here is akin to some of the irresponsible white collar crime that occured prior to and during the recession. The MSNBC show ""American Greed"" comes to mind. But still, i thought Dominik's high/low analogy didn't work all that well.The book on which the movie was based took place in Boston during the late 60's, early 70's, written by the great George V. Higgins. I really would've liked to see this production as a period piece, actually set in the 70's in Boston. Considering how hot the Boston underworld is right now due to the pending Whitey Bulger trial, I think this production missed out on a great change to visit the formative years of Bulger's underworld, which is what many believe Higgins actually based his books upon, given his first hand involvment as US Attorney for Eastern Massachusetts. The Dillon character of ""Eddie Coyle"" and this picture was thought to be loosely based on Bulger.This movie was supposed to take place in New Orleans, which is an interesting choice in regards to Dominik's metaphor because of the horrible urban decay that has taken place there, epecially since Katrina. I was a bit disspointed when I realized that the production people chose to do the ""anonymous city"" thing, which leads the viewer to believe that the events are occuring in an undisclosed location. Even though it was filmed in New Orleans, the police cars which appear only briefly are simply marked ""Police"", which I thougt was a bit tacky, given that almost every marked police car identifies its town, city or state. Dominik could have used some good comentary on New Orleans as an example of recession, poverty and crime, but instead he wanted the city to remain nameless. Even so, this story still had a great cast, but I can't say that each character was fully developed. Once again, this movie clocked in at barely 90 minutes, which I guess alot of studios crunch the time down because audiences suppossedly  don't have the attention span for 2 hour gangster movies. There were so many good aspects to this movie, but it felt very thin. A mob movie with Brad Pitt, James Gandolfini and Ray Liota, come on! They could have made this movie twice as long and still sold the tickets. This is not to say that I didn't enjoy it, only history shows that when classic literature is adapted to the screen (i.e. ""The Godfather""), it pays to stick to what has already proven to sell.There are alot of strong points to this flick, Pitt's preformance is obviously the standout, as he comes off as the voice of reason where most of the other characters are weak and indecisive. Ray Liota plays Markie Trapman, who's game gets ripped off. He is on screen for a tiny portion of the whole. The same is true of James Gandolfini, a washed up hit alchoholic hitman. There was so much room for additional scenes, especially the end of Gandolfini's character, which the viewer doesn't even get to see. This role is along way from Tony Soprano. I just thought to myself, if you have this kind of talent in a movie, why crunch it down to 90 minutes? The two stick up kids are the film's comic relief. One is an Australian junky with perverted tendencies and the other is a squeaky voiced accomplice to the 100k rip off.

1592059,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B009AMAL4Y,MadMacs,"[0, 1]","Exceedingly dark and unusual gangster tale, as we're introduced to a variety pack group of criminals. Living shabby lives on the edges of civility, the entire cast made up of unsympathetic people with absolutely no redeeming qualities.Pitt portrays Jackie Cogan, a cold-blooded, pragmatic, and socially disconnected murderer for hire. His livelihood, an ironic misnomer if there ever was one, is dealing in death. As a professional he wants, even expects, executions to be done with a degree of efficiency. With a distorted sense of pride, complains about the emotional baggage that he sees as undignified and pathetic in those who are about to die at his hands.Jackie has been brought in to deal with a bunch of thieves who stole from the wrong people.Your average knucklehead, the kind you see in programs like 'Jail' or 'Behind Bars', does not realize that for the professional criminal, after a certain point, the money or product is no longer the issue. You can't return what you've taken and apologize. No amount of reparations will suffice. For them, blood is the only thing that will clear the books.There's a reason why no half-wit moron hits a gambling den protected by the mob; be they Italian, Chinese, Gangsta, etc. It's the third rail of the underworld.While I loved the subdued cinematic palette, honed thespian performances, and the dark energy the script - I felt the film wasn't as strong as it could be. As a monster fan of David Mamet, the master of the twisted crime drama, thought 'Killing' could've used sharper dialogue, a crisper interplay between characters, and a deeper more complex plot. The simplicity, while admirable, wasn't challenging enough. Made worse by the inclusion of James Gandolfini's character as Mickey, a rambling and emotionally broken mechanic. Wasted talent as a side character that was completely unnecessary to the film.While a fascinating project for Pitt, who co-produced the movie and had full control of the direction and content, I have to give greater weight to the fact that the film's interplay wasn't as subtly explosive or creatively warped enough.

Druxman ""A Good Story is a Terribl...","[4, 8]","KILLING THEM SOFTLY, the riveting crime drama from writer/director Andrew Dominik, evokes memories of Quentin Tarantino's RESERVOIR DOGS, in that it spends a lot of time, particularly before anything significant happens, exploring the personalities of pair of secondary characters; not-too-bright amateur criminals who are about to enter the ""big time"" with disastrous results.These two schmucks (Scoot McNairy, Ben Mendelsohn), with the plan of fellow ex-con Vincent Curatola, make the mistake of holding up a Mob card game, run by Ray Liotta.  Curatola figures that, since Liotta had engineered a heist of his game once before, he will be blamed for this robbery also.Mendelsohn, however,  is not only a drug addict, but he also has a big mouth, and it not long before the Mob (represented by Richard Jenkins) knows the identities of the guys who pulled off the job.  Enforcer Brad Pitt is called in to take care of the three culprits, as well as Liotta, whose ""hit"" is necessary in the interest of ""public relations"".What makes KILLING THEM SOFTLY a unique crime drama, as well as a dark comedy, is that the action is played against the 2008 financial meltdown and Presidential campaign.  Like with the national meltdown, the robbing of the Mob card game has hurt the local crime economy.  For example, when Pitt tells Jenkins that he needs to bring in another hit man (James Gandolfini) to help him with pull off the 3-4 contact killings, the Mob boss' agrees to the price, but then insists, ""Have him fly coach"".Gritty dialogue, multi-dimensional characters, and fine performances all around results in this release from Anchor Bay Entertainment being one of the finest, and most realistic crime dramas of the past decade.A word of caution: The scenes of violence are extremely violent; not for the squeamish.DVD extras include a ""Making of"" featurette and four deleted scenes.

1592074,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B009AMAL4Y,mirasreviews,"[1, 2]","""Killing Them Softly"" was adapted by director Andrew Dominik from the 1974 novel ""Cogan's Trade"" by George V. Higgins. In an unnamed American city, struggling businessman Johnny ""Squirrel"" Amato (Vincent Curatola) hires two ex-cons, Frankie (Scoot McNairy) and Russell (Ben Mendelsohn), to knock over an underground poker game. He assumes that Markie Trattman (Ray Liotta), who runs the game, will be blamed, as he has a history of robbing games. After the clumsy robbery comes off, mob boss Dillon brings in Jackie (Brad Pitt), an enforcer from out of town, to kill the culprits and restore order. But Jackie is savvy enough to understand that Markie, though publicly culpable, had nothing to do with the robbery and to figure out who did.George V. Higgins began writing noir crime novels in the 1970s under a cloud of malaise occasioned by stagflation, Watergate, high crime rates, and a feeling of social decay peculiar to that decade. Andrew Dominik moved the action to 2008, in the midst of a global financial crisis and US presidential election campaigns, to capitalize on the basic economic nature of the story. Frankie and Russell's robbery has upset the underworld economy. One party stole money from another in order to fulfill its plans, leaving the other in crisis, and Jackie just wants to get paid. Though I can understand why Dominik would choose to adapt this novel at this time, it is not as successful as ""The Friends of Eddie Coyle"" (1973), which was adapted from Higgins' 1970 novel of the same name.Though the film is visually arresting, it maintains a distance from the characters that prevents the audience from identifying with their emotions. They are simply spectacle. The story is told primarily though a series of conversations -conversations between Frankie and Russell, which are hilarious, between Frankie and Squirrel, between Jackie and his liaison (Richard Jenkins) with Dillon, between Jackie and a washed-up out-of-town hitman Mickey (James Gandolfini). The conversations are mundane and naturalistic, as if Quentin Tarantino had taken a shot of realism. But they are not affecting. There is no way to connect with the characters, a problem that plagued Dominik's earlier film ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" (2007) as well.Without the ability to see anything from the characters' point of view, they have no impact. The socio-political threads that run through the film are heavy-handed, which tends to undermine any attempt at a theme. In Peter Yates' adaptation of ""The Friends of Eddie Coyle"", the malaise came through without anyone mentioning stagflation or politics. In contrast, Dominik has television and radio commentary on the financial crisis and election campaign running in the background of ""Killing Them Softly"". If you have to state your ideas repeatedly in order for them to be understood, your film is not working. There is a lot to like in ""Killing Them Softly"".

1592079,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B009AMAL4Y,M. Oleson,"[2, 6]","Brad Pitt's performance as mob hit man Jackie is getting a lot of attention but he doesn't come into the picture until well into the second act.  He is hired to ""resolve"" an issue of mob sanctioned poker games being held up.  One game in particular is run by a small time crook named Markie (Ray Liotta).  In reality, he hired a couple of low-lifes to rob his own game.  Then, years later began to brag about it.  Not smart.  Another set of dimwit crooks (Scoot McNairy and Ben Medelsohn) are persuaded by another (Vincent Curatola) to knock off the game again.  They figure poor old Markie would be fingered, assuming he would be dumb enough to pull the same stunt twice.Director/writer Andrew Dominik is no stranger to long-winded scenes (check out the superior ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" also starring Pitt) but here, it just didn't seem natural.  Certainly Dominik has Scorsese and Tarantino as influences for staging long dialog-heavy scenes between gangsters, not to mention a heavy dose of stylized violence.  The initial hold up scene is pretty tense and very well done.Later in the film, James Gandolfini shows up as a secondary hit man to help Jackie.  He's ugly, heavy, profane and drunk throughout his scenes.  Gandolfini does a fine job with the role, but it is clearly not essential to the story.  I didn't get it.  Richard Jenkins is the middle manager contact for Jackie and some of the conversations between him and Pitt's character are certainly worthwhile.Violence?  You bet.  But that is to be expected going in and there are only a couple that might get some people uncomfortable.  The movie isn't terrible but it isn't great either.

1592096,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B009AMAL4Y,Paul Allaer,"[68, 86]","""Killing Them Softly"" (2012 release; 100 min.) reunites writer/director Andrew Dominik with Brad Pitt (following 2007's ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford""). The movie brings the story of how some small-time thieves hold up a poker game organized for the mob by Markie (played by Ray Liotta). The mob brings in Jackie (played by Brad Pitt) to find out who did the hold-up and to ""clean things up, and so Jackie goes about his business. To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: when all is said and done, the substantive plot is surprisingly meager, and in that sense there is no suspense whatsoever in how things will turn out. Instead the movie focuses on conversations between the various characters in the movie, which works great. If you've seen the trailer for this movie, you are aware already that there are several violent scenes in the movie, but for the most part they are brought in a very stylish manner (at one point one of the main characters is gunned down and the whole scene, shown in slow motion and set to the 1960s Ketty Lester hit ""Love Letters"", feels like an orchestrated ballet scene. That said, there is another scene in which Markie is beaten up that is over-the-top violent, so viewer beware. Despite the 1980s feeling to many scenes in the movies (check out many of the cars used by the main characters), the movie is set very specifically in the Fall of 2008, as we see a number of clips featuring Bush and Obama, commenting on the then just exploding financial crisis, which is in marked contrast (or perhaps not?) to the violence occurring in the movie.But most of all this movie is about incredible acting performances. Let's start off with Brad Pitt, who is masterful as Jackie, with a physical presence in his role that belies his age (Pitt is nearing 50, if you can believe it). Several other side roles are brought quite nicely as well, certainly Ray Liotta as Markie, but also Ben Mendelsohn as one of the poker game robbers who turns out to be a complete junkie living fix to fix. But the real scene-stealer for me was James Gandolfini as Mickey, a one-time associate of Jackie who gets called in by Jackie to provide some assistance but instead it turns out has become a drunk unable to do the job. While Gandolfini has brought this type of ""bad"" character before, he nevertheless once again does it with a fervor that remains compelling to watch. Bottom line, I enjoyed this movie from start to finish and couldn't believe when the light came on in the theatre tonight how quickly the movie had come and gone.

Certainly it was slow moving, and the political messages popping up here and there seemed pointless, as if they were trying to come up with something to say to make the less than interesting script more interesting. All it did was annoy me though. I wondered what the point was. However the good news is that there is a lot to like about this film. It's made in a more traditional manner, like the slow moving crime stories of the 70's were made.The dialogue is interesting sometimes, especially the segments that included James Gandolfini's character. His acting is as always- superb, and though he's talking about every day subjects like the endless hookers he's slept with, the interesting thing is how well he ponders the subject and reflects upon it. In reality his performance is the most memorable thing about this film. Let's be clear though, this is not an action picture, it's more about mood and atmosphere. It's about taking time to get the audience sitting tight with their seatbelts firmly fastened wondering what is going to happen next. It comes off feeling more like reality. Like the way life really is. Bad men who commit murder discussing their every day lives.Brad Pitt's character is probably the least interesting thing about this movie. He's playing this guy like the kind of emotionless bad guys we've seen a hundred times in movies. The issue is though that he's simply doing it by the numbers, he's playing it rather bluntly and not with any particular conviction. He's just doing a simple acting job. It's a simple roll, played well enough but it's simply not that interesting of a character or that noteworthy of a performance.Anyway when there is violence it's not dissapointing. it's rude, brash and unforgiving, just as life can often be. My only gripe is that it takes so much time for the plot to thicken that by the time you start to feel like the movie is paying off it simply ends. It felt too short and abrupt. I didn't like the ending or the manner in which Pitt's character get's political on American immorality in politics, then follows that with a simple ""Ef you, Pay Me!!""The movie has some shining moments but the pay off is not all you hope it will be. It left me wanting more. Wanting more to happen, more character development, more insights into the the crimes and the people who committed them.

I don't recall any of the filmmakers promising an ""action-filled extravaganza"" or an ""orgy of violence"", or any of the other marketing terms one sees on movies these days. Whenever violence happens in a movie like this, it MEANS something, which is the way it should be. Also, I do prefer movies that tell me only what I as a viewer need to know, not films that spoon-feed me every little detail. Whatever's not on the page can be conveyed through the performances of the actors, if they're good enough, and guys like Brad Pitt, James Gandolfini (who is flat out terrific here, R.I.P.), Ray Liotta and Richard Jenkins are DEFINITELY good enough. As for all the political rhetoric, I feel like it was a bit clunky and a little off-putting. I wish Dominik had dialed it down a little bit, because it got repetitive at one point (and not to stereotype, but are a bunch of street-level mob guys and hustlers going to be keeping such close tabs on financial news anyway, to the point where they have their radios tuned to news radio and their TVs tuned to C-SPAN?). Still, I like a film that has some ambition and errs on the side of trying too hard to make the audience think, rather than not at all.And for the people down below here who complained about having to listen to Obama's speeches, get a life. The point they're making is that the whole system was flawed. They're not lifting Obama up to be a hero; if anything, they're underlining the fact that, after all the flowery speeches and the glowing campaign, it's going to more of the same-old-same-old whoever takes the election. The movies denies whatever pandering ""we're-in-this-together"" swill Bush and Obama are slinging and sides with Brad Pitt's pragmatic character, who knows that these days, America is every man for himself. It would be a shame to deny yourself a good movie just because of some imagined political affiliation you have that, with each year, has less and less of a distinction anyway.Of course, if you don't like to actually think, I understand there's a new Transformers movie coming soon, so... enjoy that.********Killing Them Softly (2012)Starring: Brad Pitt, Richard Jenkins, Ray Liotta, James GandolfiniWritten & Directed by: Andrew Dominik",4,A movie that makes you think is destined to have a middling rating these days.,1371945600,"06 23, 2013",2013,2349,"['Killing', 'Them', 'Softly', '2012', 'Killing', 'Them', 'Softly', 'slow-burn', 'crime', 'drama', 'political', 'metaphor', 'not', 'action', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'filmmakers', 'promising', 'action-filled', 'extravaganza', 'orgy', 'violence', 'other', 'marketing', 'terms', 'one', 'sees', 'movies', 'days', 'Whenever', 'violence', 'movie', 'something', 'way', 'should', 'be', 'Also', 'do', 'prefer', 'movies', 'tell', 'only', 'what', 'as', 'viewer', 'need', 'know', 'not', 'films', 'spoon-feed', 'little', 'detail', 'not', 'page', 'can', 'be', 'conveyed', 'performances', 'actors', ""'re"", 'good', 'enough', 'guys', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'James', 'Gandolfini', 'who', 'flat', 'terrific', 'here', 'R.I.P', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'are', 'DEFINITELY', 'good', 'enough', 'political', 'rhetoric', 'feel', 'was', 'bit', 'clunky', 'little', 'off-putting', 'wish', 'Dominik', 'had', 'dialed', 'down', 'little', 'bit', 'got', 'repetitive', 'one', 'point', 'not', 'stereotype', 'are', 'bunch', 'street-level', 'mob', 'guys', 'hustlers', 'going', 'be', 'keeping', 'such', 'close', 'tabs', 'financial', 'news', 'anyway', 'point', 'where', 'have', 'radios', 'tuned', 'news', 'radio', 'TVs', 'tuned', 'C-SPAN', 'Still', 'like', 'film', 'ambition', 'errs', 'side', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'make', 'audience', 'think', 'rather', 'not', 'all.And', 'people', 'down', 'here', 'who', 'complained', 'having', 'listen', 'Obama', 'speeches', 'get', 'life', 'point', ""'re"", 'making', 'whole', 'system', 'was', 'flawed', ""'re"", 'not', 'lifting', 'Obama', 'up', 'be', 'hero', 'anything', ""'re"", 'underlining', 'fact', 'flowery', 'speeches', 'glowing', 'campaign', 'going', 'more', 'same-old-same-old', 'election', 'movies', 'pandering', ""we're-in-this-together"", 'swill', 'Bush', 'Obama', 'are', 'slinging', 'sides', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'pragmatic', 'character', 'who', 'days', 'America', 'man', 'would', 'be', 'shame', 'deny', 'good', 'movie', 'just', 'imagined', 'political', 'affiliation', 'have', 'year', 'less', 'less', 'distinction', 'anyway.Of', 'course', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'actually', 'think', 'understand', 'new', 'Transformers', 'movie', 'coming', 'soon', 'enjoy', '********Killing', 'Them', 'Softly', '2012', 'Starring', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'James', 'GandolfiniWritten', 'Directed', 'Andrew', 'Dominik']",N/A

But instead, as is evidenced in this movie, when this struggle can't find resolution it ""can give rise to irrational and sometimes maladaptive behavior"". Brad Pitt and James Gandolfini are excellent, as is the entire cast.  The direction (also by Mr. Dominik)is perfect.

""Since hollywood wants to do nothin...","[1, 2]","It's a shame that this movie just simply could not have been better, but therein lies the problem with people like Brad Pitt -- simplicity and/or subtlety isn't their milieu.Yes, Pitt has yet again (see the laughably-bad &#34;World War Z&#34;) fearlessly cast himself in the lead of a film he also produced. Golly, the wonder of it all. Anyway, let's begin with the positives...Ray Liotta, Vincent Curatola and James Gandolfini still respectively represent presences on the screen to be reckoned with and the script melded very seamlessly with their talents. Being good quality actors, they played their roles extremely well, played to the intricacies of their characters and came-off as more than impressive. On that note, I have no doubt that the original script was quite promising, as you can sense that (at times) not only did the plot itself and character interaction work the way a film is supposed to, but you can also see clearly the grittiness of what was at least intended.However, no matter how promising a film looks on paper, if the execution of said film is meant to be nothing more than a vanity project for an actor whose range can't go further than a lake pier, you'll get the same results as this film. I'll start with deconstructing Brad &#34;Hair Flip&#34; Pitt... who cast himself as a hard-as-a-coffin-nail hitman? Yeah, wow. Growing some peach fuzz on your face, scowling, sauntering into buildings and slicking your hair back with Crisco is not going to convince an audience that you can actually handle yourself in fight, okay Mr. Jolie? Literally, he looked like he had grown a weekend's worth of stubble whilst yachting.But enough about Mr. Hollywooden Power-lunch. The film at times got caught-up in it's hollow wannabe-artistic aspects. Slowing down the film and making everything blurry to show the point of view of a heroin addict REPEATEDLY during a 5 minute scene makes me wonder if the director just wanted to insure that he had a 95+ minute film. And despite how well Gandolfini played his role, the scripting of his character as a washed-up alcoholic is fine and dandy, but focusing on how many beers/scotches/paint-thinners he can slam during ONE lunch date gets old after a while. And let us not forget the long sequences in which someone is (wait for it)... walking to a destination? Were the makers trying to build suspense? Didn't work. Were the makers trying to show the intricacies of the characters by doing this? Didn't work.If you can watch this film without paying (like I did), I say go for it. It comes-off like a cheap, generic suit and isn't worth your money. However, paying more than $3 for a rental of it won't be the most shrewd investment you've ever made, either.

Despite all of the mixed reviews, the style and atmosphere of this movie is similar to the movie ""Fargo"".  It's brutal, bloody, gory, serious, and hardcore.  A kind of (dry-drama) just like the movie ""Fargo"", and yet still amazingly interesting, drawing you in, and holding your attention with every scene. The overview of this movie:  Some Mob bosses are relaxing with some private backroom poker, when suddenly robbed by some clowns. The Bosses hire a hit man (Brad Pitt) to investigate and kill all involved in the robbery. This movie even with its (Fargo) dryness is a (top level heavy hitting movie).

The end will leave you a bit up in that air...but then that is what happened with the bailout.  Gandolfini plays a hit man out of control really well.  A man on the edge of disaster and addicted to his vices...and the parallel for that can be made to a specific banker...even to his exit from the film.  Unceremoniously gone.

Pitt takes over for the mysterious Dillon, guy who sets everything up in the hit department but not specifically identified in the film as Dillion (Sam Shepherd.)  There is a group of 'decision makers' who are unseen and unidentified but represented by Richard Jenkins.  He constantly complains of how everything takes time as everything has to be discussed and put to a vote...for hiring a kill, to who takes the fall.  Since Pitt is good at what he does, the unseen would be wary of his revenge.  But, his livelihood depends on these decision makers...and vice-versa.A bit grisly and bloody in spots.  Sickeningly so.

Although the actors are playing a part about an individual situation and to what lengths these people will go the reality is each actor is playing a group in our society. You really need to pay attention to the political undertones and how that is connected to what the actors are doing.

In this film the criminals talk the talk,we are led by the dialogue into espying what the contrasting action set-pieces will be,figuring out the plot,where they walk the walk.The weaselly ex-con Frankie(Scot McNairy) and his addled side-kick Russell(Mendelsohn) have knocked over the poker game,one to get a better car and more sex,the other to get drugged,you know they are both doomed.Also Markie having previously robbed his own game,suspicion will immediately fall on him again.A mob fixer hires Jackie Cogan(Pitt) to eliminate the perpetrators of the robbery and restore confidence.Writer-director Dominik has adapted/updated Higgins 70s novel,Cogan's Trade,to show the fissure opened up in the idea of community, whereby organised crime is a microcosm of the whole. Ideals are a faade that masks a system run on individual self-interest and greed.The hold-up with sawn-off shot guns is edgy,unpredictable,the violence of Markie's beating up is hard to watch,these are grimy,scummy people who treat women like dirt and hold life in contempt.Pitt's amiable assassin prefers to ""kill them softly"",pick his targets off long range,flitting from personal bonhomie to dead-eyed murderous efficiency.Cogan thinks bringing in fellow assassin Mickey(Gandolfini) to share the hits,only for the latter to prove a drunken,sex-addicted liability.The film has some beautifully weighted scenes of dialogue between Cogan and Jenkins,a middle management operative,Cogan and Mickey,with more flamboyant set-pieces, a slow-mo symphony of breaking glass and spurting blood,accompanied by ballads like `Love Letters.'The film is full of a kind of dirty realism,dark shadows,vintage autos prowling through the night,and the slangy zing of foul-mouthed punks who are prey to corporate manoeuvres,which dictate you have to kill someone who wasn't responsible for the heist to restore public trust.

He hires two guys to rob a poker game filled with organized criminals. Frankie (Scoot McNairy) is the lead robber, a man who is a Steve Buscemi type. He has help from an unkempt Australian junkie friend named Russell (Ben Mendelsohn), who walks pets for a living. He hopes to be a drug dealer to change his life.The reason why they believe they can get away with the job is because Markie Trattman (Ray Liotta) had done this job once before. He will surely be blamed. After the job is pulled, hitman Jackie (Brad Pitt) is brought in to sort things out and make things right. Jackie is thoughtful, soft spoken, and cynical. Since he knows Johnny, he hires Mickey (James Gandolfini) to do the job, a man who has multiple issues.There are a number of things which set this film apart from other crime movies. First is the dialouge. It is clear the people are uneducated, except for Jackie who speaks as if he lives in two worlds. The ignorance of the robbers is brought to light when they wear bright yellow cleaning gloves to perform their task.The second aspect is the background sound on both the radio, TV, and jukeboxes. It is the macrocosm of what is happening on the screen, and sometimes in an ironic fashion. The time period is the 2008 election season during the financial collapse. We hear ""restore confidence in the financial system"" and ""it's all too familiar"" on the radio when Markie is about to take the fall. Every time ""B"" actor Ray Liotta got punched or kicked, I would think, This is for ""Entitled"" or This is for ""Ticket Out."" Here is one for ""The Son of No One.""The symbolism of the background announcements is brought to light at the end, in case you failed to catch it in the opening scene.

I think Andrew Dominik does this with Killing Them Softly.  Most of the negative reviews might have been positive if the viewers had been familiar with Higgins' novel Cogan's Trade.  Higgins' command of dialogue is the highlight of his writing, maybe more important than the story itself.  It translates really well into this script, and if you're a fan of well-written conversation, Killing Them Softly works.  Dominik overlays Higgins' plot with the political scene from 2008, and this really fit.  Like it or not, Dominik and Higgins say, money is at the core of just about everything, whether it be politics or a mob hit.  As good as the book is, and I think it's great, the movie stands on its own as a great gangster story.  All actors are doing wonderful work here, and each scene is a gem.  If you want a movie-going experience that is scene after scene of superb acting from each player with dialogue that snaps, this is it.  Don't bring the kids.

He possesses a clearly defined vision for his films and Killing them Softly is no different. This was far and away the best film of 2012, it was also the most underrated and perhaps unfairly criticized. I can see how some people would be turned off by this film, it's an odd and heady mix of politics, mob movie, grit, dirt, and the characters are a mash up of broken down drunks, ex-cons, and druggies who are barely hanging on to an America that's given up on them (or just never knew about them in the first place.) But for all it's weight Killing them Softly never cracks. It's frequently funny (albeit darkly funny) and hits you square in the chest. It's brutal but beautifully so. Brad Pitt, is a performer whose truly come into his own in the last 10 to 15 years and Killing them Softly is the culmination of all of that talent. James Gandolfini is as always wonderful but I think the true standout is Scoot McNairy playing the ex-con drug addict who embodies every American dream gone (way) wrong. Not only does he frequently steal the show from everyone he shares the screen with and not only does he gain sympathy from the audience he completely breaks your heart with his stunning performance.

That's what the trailer makes us think. But, that's not entirely what the movie is about, and anyone who is expecting an action-packed crime drama will be gravely disappointed. That's the con of the movie - that it doesn't deliver what we see in the trailer. But, if a viewer can keep an open mind, this film is awesome, and it's truly a cinematic triumph.Simply-put, this film represents recession-era American crime syndicates; how the recession affected the syndicates. Although it's Hollywood, it's still fairly accurate. Is it slow at times? Yes. But, that just makes it more realistic; the criminal underworld isn't as fast-paced as outsiders imagine. It's also brutal, extremely graphic and occasionally hilarious. When Gandolfini's character was introduced, I laughed hysterically for a good three minutes, and that was enough for me to love this movie. It's pure genius.Was there a political statement? Kinda. But, it adds to the story line. In 2008, America's economy tanked. When the public has less money, the syndicates have less money, and this was very well portrayed in this film. Add to that life crises, stress, burnout, alcoholism, marital problems, drug abuse and other every-day phenomena, and we're given an accurate expression of what it's like to be a wiseguy in what is literally a dead-end job during The Great Recession.But, like I said, if all you want is a crime-action-shooter, you'll be disappointed, and I'm guessing that's why many people apparently dislike this film.This is my new #1 movie of all time.

There's one too many slow motion close-up of a pistol's firing pin and corny drug-trip lens flashes to signify that characters are getting high. A couple scenes with James Gandolfini as an alcoholic hit man that should have crackled drag on like improv exercises. Characters take heroin while the Velvet Underground's ""Heroin"" plays on the soundtrack. Still, for the most part the movie delivers the goods. There are tough guys mixing violence with comically obscene chit-chat. There is a crime that couldn't possibly go wrong that of course goes horribly wrong. There is one brilliant heist set-piece that makes the audience sweat on behalf of stick-up men who are in way over their heads. The cinematography revels in the sleaze of a sickly looking, trash-strewn urban cesspool, and you get to say to yourself, ""Hey, there's Ray Liotta."" There's nothing wrong with being a B movie, and ""Killing Them Softly"" is maybe a B-.The problem is that it wants to be more. And the more it specifically wants to be is an unblinking look at the dark side of the American dream. ""Killing them Softly"" does this by setting the action in 2008 and filling the background with news clips of Bush and Obama campaigning and holding forth on the Wall Street bailouts. There are no similarities between the national events and the ones on screen besides the fact that both involve money and public perception, like much of human life. (If this movie had actually gone down like the 2008 bailouts, the mob would have showered the guys who knocked off their poker game with cash.) Had ""Killing them Softly"" retained the 1970s setting of the novel it's based on, we would have heard Carter and Ford in the background, prattling on about stagflation, and it would have seemed equally arbitrary. The deeper message ends up a limp, generic: Republicans, Democrats--they're all crooks. As political commentary, this is slightly less incisive than Mark Russell. Then, not content to let its lousy parts exist solely in the background, ""Killing Them Softly"" closes with a monologue from Brad Pitt's hitman character in which he says in pretty much so many words, America, it's just as corrupt as the events you've witnessed here, dear viewer.
