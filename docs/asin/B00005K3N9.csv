660375,A2ERKE0L4DPUC4,B00005K3N9,Angel,"[8, 8]","I have very mixed feelings towards this workout. I like the bellydancing but something about Dolphina turns me off. It felt like she was trying to be a sex symbol and appeal to men at the same time as trying to connect with the women who are trying to learn the dance. As a result you get unnecessary foci and panning of her body which unfortunately inhibit the workout. This is particularly true where it gets into the really interesting hip movements. However, if you choose to ignore this you will still be able to learn a majority of the moves in the workout (She also isn't the best at giving directions, but it doesn't matter too much as this is a very loose, free formish workout).Another issue is her vague goddess talk. Since she doesn't go very in depth about the history and legends she is referring to it ends up sounding very gimmicky, like a ploy to appeal to women seeking empowerment. It makes the dance seem more commercial, especially in light of her company goddesslife.On the positive side, the sets and costumes are very beautiful. Her voice is very nice and soothing(although that is nullified somewhat by the empty goddess talk). Most importantly, it is fun!If you want to see what bellydancing is like, want to experience something new and different, or want to add a little variety to your fitness regime (Be forewarned: this is not the best for cardio as it will barely raise your heart rate) then try this. If you want to seriously learn to bellydance I recommend you pick a workout that will illustrate all the moves fully.",3,Good for some fun,1060128000,"08 6, 2003",2003,1551,"['have', 'very', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'workout', 'bellydancing', 'something', 'Dolphina', 'turns', 'off', 'felt', 'was', 'trying', 'be', 'sex', 'symbol', 'appeal', 'men', 'same', 'time', 'trying', 'connect', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'learn', 'dance', 'result', 'get', 'unnecessary', 'foci', 'panning', 'body', 'unfortunately', 'inhibit', 'workout', 'particularly', 'true', 'where', 'really', 'interesting', 'hip', 'movements', 'However', 'choose', 'ignore', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'able', 'learn', 'majority', 'moves', 'workout', 'also', ""n't"", 'best', 'giving', 'directions', ""n't"", 'matter', 'too', 'much', 'very', 'loose', 'free', 'formish', 'workout', '.Another', 'issue', 'vague', 'goddess', 'talk', ""n't"", 'go', 'very', 'depth', 'history', 'referring', 'up', 'sounding', 'very', 'gimmicky', 'ploy', 'appeal', 'women', 'seeking', 'empowerment', 'dance', 'seem', 'more', 'commercial', 'especially', 'light', 'company', 'goddesslife.On', 'positive', 'side', 'sets', 'costumes', 'are', 'very', 'beautiful', 'voice', 'very', 'nice', 'soothing', 'nullified', 'somewhat', 'empty', 'goddess', 'talk', 'Most', 'importantly', 'fun', 'want', 'see', 'what', 'bellydancing', 'want', 'experience', 'something', 'new', 'different', 'want', 'add', 'little', 'variety', 'fitness', 'regime', 'Be', 'forewarned', 'not', 'best', 'cardio', 'will', 'barely', 'raise', 'heart', 'rate', 'then', 'try', 'want', 'seriously', 'learn', 'bellydance', 'recommend', 'pick', 'workout', 'will', 'illustrate', 'moves', 'fully']",The Goddess Workout: Introduction to Bellydance

660377,A1WXV2M71VH7TH,B00005K3N9,A woman,"[5, 6]","No, this is NOT the same Dolphina that I saw in ""The Goddess Workout - Advanced Bellydance""...This time she tries really hard to convince you that bellydance is the best way to seduce men. She ends up looking like a strikingly untalented actress from a really corny movie. In addition to all her ""sultry"" faces and intonation, she constantly says something perfectly silly/irrelevant. If she'd titled this video ""Parody of Bellydance"", or better yet ""Parody of Playboy"", I'd have rated it higher - it is quite funny. But apparently she meant to be inspirational  :-DIf you are looking for a motivational video that would make you smile in a good way, get ""Bellydance for Romance"" with Jayna. Jayna manages to look... mmm... desirable... without losing taste and sense of humor.If you are looking for a quality instruction, quality workout, and overall quality video, ""Learn lavish layers with Ansuya"" is unmatched.If you are looking for a comedy, then you just found the right video. It's not only Dolphina's awkward manners that make it worth watching. Most of the moves are so sloppily explained and soooooo sloppily shown here... or not shown at all since her camera operator usually gets distracted with something else. The more complicated the move is, the less time Dolphina spends on it... and the camera person basically misses it! Sometimes Dolphina just gets confused:- She breaks down a vertical chest circle, then picks up speed with a horizontal one, then walks with a vertical one.- She breaks down what she calls ""Snakes"" - a figure that I'd never seen before. Then it turns out the figure is so complicated that Dolphina herself can't perform it up to speed and ends up doing a regular upward hip circle.- She tells you to alternate between the upper and lower body undulation, but doesn't bother to alternate them herself, sticking to just the lower body undulation.Most amusingly, she usually can't control her clumsy hands and arms. I also love her weird habit of counting from 1 to 8... because she enjoys it so much... why care for those poor folks who want to hear the music? The routine at the end is a delight: The choreography and the music are a perfect mismatch. I guess both Dolphina and the camera operator were high on drugs while making this video...On a serious note, I actually do appreciate Dolphina's attempts to convey to the viewer that bellydance is fun and accessible to everyone. OK, she failed, but at least she sincerely tried. I've seen instructors that didn't try in any way to make learning from them enjoyable. Suzanna in her ""Precision motion workout"" or Nourhan in ""Introduction to bellydance technique"" try to pack a lot of material in one DVD, and they end up presenting it in a totally unusable way. I'd say their approach is even worse than the one in this psychedelic workout.At least Dolphina invested in making her scenery outstanding. And she changes not only backgrounds but also her cute outfits frequently, which I always appreciate in workouts, as I do get a bit tired of looking at the same costume for too long. And she has picked pretty addictive music (if you can hear it through her ""enlightening"" talk and compulsive counting).",2,Highly recommended for laughs!,1156896000,"08 30, 2006",2006,3193,"['NOT', 'same', 'Dolphina', 'saw', 'Goddess', 'Workout', 'Advanced', 'Bellydance', 'time', 'really', 'hard', 'convince', 'bellydance', 'best', 'way', 'seduce', 'men', 'up', 'looking', 'strikingly', 'untalented', 'actress', 'really', 'corny', 'movie', 'addition', 'sultry', 'intonation', 'constantly', 'something', 'perfectly', 'silly/irrelevant', ""'d"", 'titled', 'video', 'Parody', 'Bellydance', 'better', 'yet', 'Parody', 'Playboy', ""'d"", 'have', 'rated', 'higher', 'quite', 'funny', 'apparently', 'meant', 'be', 'inspirational', '-DIf', 'are', 'looking', 'motivational', 'video', 'would', 'make', 'smile', 'good', 'way', 'get', 'Bellydance', 'Romance', 'Jayna', 'Jayna', 'look', 'mmm', 'desirable', 'losing', 'taste', 'sense', 'humor.If', 'are', 'looking', 'quality', 'instruction', 'quality', 'workout', 'overall', 'quality', 'video', 'Learn', 'lavish', 'layers', 'Ansuya', 'unmatched.If', 'are', 'looking', 'comedy', 'then', 'just', 'found', 'right', 'video', 'not', 'only', 'Dolphina', 'awkward', 'manners', 'make', 'worth', 'watching', 'Most', 'moves', 'are', 'so', 'sloppily', 'explained', 'soooooo', 'sloppily', 'shown', 'here', 'not', 'shown', 'camera', 'operator', 'usually', 'distracted', 'something', 'else', 'more', 'complicated', 'move', 'less', 'time', 'Dolphina', 'camera', 'person', 'basically', 'Sometimes', 'Dolphina', 'just', 'confused', 'down', 'vertical', 'chest', 'circle', 'then', 'up', 'speed', 'horizontal', 'one', 'then', 'vertical', 'one.-', 'down', 'what', 'Snakes', 'figure', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'Then', 'out', 'figure', 'so', 'complicated', 'Dolphina', 'ca', ""n't"", 'perform', 'up', 'speed', 'up', 'doing', 'regular', 'upward', 'hip', 'circle.-', 'alternate', 'upper', 'lower', 'body', 'undulation', ""n't"", 'bother', 'alternate', 'sticking', 'just', 'lower', 'body', 'undulation.Most', 'amusingly', 'usually', 'ca', ""n't"", 'control', 'clumsy', 'hands', 'arms', 'also', 'love', 'weird', 'habit', 'counting', '1', '8', 'so', 'much', 'why', 'care', 'poor', 'folks', 'who', 'want', 'hear', 'music', 'routine', 'end', 'delight', 'choreography', 'music', 'are', 'perfect', 'mismatch', 'guess', 'Dolphina', 'camera', 'operator', 'were', 'high', 'drugs', 'making', 'video', 'serious', 'note', 'actually', 'do', 'appreciate', 'Dolphina', 'attempts', 'convey', 'viewer', 'bellydance', 'fun', 'accessible', 'everyone', 'OK', 'failed', 'least', 'sincerely', 'tried', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'instructors', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'way', 'make', 'learning', 'enjoyable', 'Suzanna', 'Precision', 'motion', 'workout', 'Nourhan', 'Introduction', 'bellydance', 'technique', 'try', 'pack', 'lot', 'material', 'one', 'DVD', 'end', 'up', 'presenting', 'totally', 'unusable', 'way', ""'d"", 'say', 'approach', 'even', 'worse', 'one', 'psychedelic', 'workout.At', 'least', 'Dolphina', 'invested', 'making', 'scenery', 'outstanding', 'not', 'only', 'also', 'cute', 'frequently', 'always', 'appreciate', 'workouts', 'do', 'get', 'bit', 'tired', 'looking', 'same', 'costume', 'too', 'long', 'picked', 'pretty', 'addictive', 'music', 'can', 'hear', 'enlightening', 'talk', 'compulsive', 'counting']",The Goddess Workout: Introduction to Bellydance

However, I will say that when she has you holding your arms up in the air for extended periods of time, I feel the burn.  Even with that I still feel like I'm learning bellydance moves rather than doing a workout.But it's fun to do.  And the routine at the end is a bit hard to follow due to the poor camera work.The only major problem with this DVD is the camera work.  Whoever decided to focus on her face so much of the time, instead of her body, so the movements she was doing could be seen made a mistake!  But there's another thing about this DVD that bugs me and I can't quite put it into words.  Maybe the best way to express it is to say that on the one hand an atmosphere of the Divine Femminine is created and honored and she talks about the healing effects of opening the chakras that bellydance has, yet on the other hand, it looks like she might possibly have dyed her hair blonde, which kind of says bimbo!However, she is an excellent teacher and this is DVD does teach a lot of bellydance moves.  I really feel that she does a good job of teaching all the various moves at a fairly leisurely pace and with lots of repitition, which makes them fairly easy to learn.So to sum it all up:  I reccomend this video for Goddess Worshippers and for feeling like a Goddess!",4,She is a really good teacher!

The only positive aspect of this workout is the eye candy.  The costumes and sets are gorgeous.  But this wasn't meant to be a performance video...it was meant to teach.The main problem is the camera work.  Frequently, the camera focuses on Dolphina's face or chest when you're supposed to be doing things with the lower body.  At one point she said ""now let's add a leg movement.""  So I stood there waiting for the camera to show her leg (it was focused on her upper body).  And I kept waiting, and waiting.  Then we moved on to something else.  I never did figure out what she was doing with her leg.  Similar things happened throughout the workout.  The camera may focus on the proper area for a short time, but quickly moves somewhere else before you can get the movement down.She explained a few things adequately, but others left me completely lost.  She would go on and on about ""goddess energy"" and chakras which did not help me with dance form at all.  She kept trying to act sexy which was really embarassing when one of my family members came in the room.

I do recommend this workout DVD.",4,Good for beginners,1093046400,"08 21, 2004",2004,715,"[""n't"", 'as', 'fun', 'Belly', 'Queen', 'DVD', 'much', 'better', ""'re"", 'beginner', 'not', 'shape', 'really', 'klutzy', 'very', 'positive', 'talks', 'Goddess', 'energy', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'nice', 'soothing', 'as', 'well', 'need', 'connect', 'female', 'energy', 'working', 'males', 'day', ""'m"", 'not', 'very', 'disciplined', 'exercising', 'keep', 'coming', 'back', 'one', 'fun', 'simple', 'enough', 'can', 'do', 'yet', 'challenging', 'enough', 'other', 'areas', 'know', 'have', 'long', 'ways', 'go', ""'ll"", 'actually', 'be', 'able', 'move', 'next', 'one', 'series', 'characters', 'Full', 'Monty', 'find', 'trying', 'work', 'out', 'moves', 'oddest', 'places', 'do', 'recommend', 'workout', 'DVD']",The Goddess Workout: Introduction to Bellydance
660388,AEAZ279594XL5,B00005K3N9,thickmilkshake,"[6, 6]","I have this video and also The Warrior Goddess, and Bellydance with Veils.This is a very strange video, the camera work blows, Dolphina uses a strange fake seductive voice and vapid stare.  She also talks about her new age views, which is fine, except that combined with the fake sexy voice, it sounds like she's high on drugs.  It doesn't lend itself to thinking of her as an authority on dancing.Besides that, there are actually some redeeming qualities to this video.  If you started with Veena and Neena's videos, this is more of a challenge.  There are new additonal moves on this video, plus she combines the moves into a short routine at the end (before the cool down).  It's also longer than the bellydance videos by the twins, so you will get more mileage out of it.Dolphina starts with a warm up, shows technique in sections for upper and lower body, demonstrates a routine and then ends with a cool down.  From the beginning of the workout to the end, it's about 40-45 minutes.If you start with the Veena and Neena as a foundation and move to this video, you will be able to make it past the crappy camera work, the phoney sex and Dolphina's odd counting.Once you are done, move onto the The Warrior Goddess, the camera work is better, no sex bunny stares.  She did a much better job in that video.",4,Bellydance through the eyes of a pornographer!,1126483200,"09 12, 2005",2005,1309,"['have', 'video', 'also', 'Warrior', 'Goddess', 'Bellydance', 'Veils.This', 'very', 'strange', 'video', 'camera', 'work', 'blows', 'Dolphina', 'strange', 'fake', 'seductive', 'voice', 'vapid', 'stare', 'also', 'new', 'age', 'views', 'fine', 'combined', 'fake', 'sexy', 'voice', 'high', 'drugs', ""n't"", 'lend', 'thinking', 'authority', 'dancing.Besides', 'are', 'actually', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'video', 'started', 'Veena', 'Neena', 'videos', 'more', 'challenge', 'are', 'new', 'additonal', 'moves', 'video', 'moves', 'short', 'routine', 'end', 'cool', 'down', 'also', 'longer', 'bellydance', 'videos', 'twins', 'will', 'get', 'more', 'mileage', 'it.Dolphina', 'starts', 'warm', 'up', 'technique', 'sections', 'upper', 'lower', 'body', 'routine', 'then', 'cool', 'down', 'beginning', 'workout', 'end', '40-45', 'minutes.If', 'start', 'Veena', 'Neena', 'foundation', 'move', 'video', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'make', 'crappy', 'camera', 'work', 'phoney', 'sex', 'Dolphina', 'odd', 'counting.Once', 'are', 'done', 'move', 'Warrior', 'Goddess', 'camera', 'work', 'better', 'sex', 'bunny', 'stares', 'did', 'much', 'better', 'job', 'video']",The Goddess Workout: Introduction to Bellydance

Her upper and lower body can not perform most of the moves correctly especially the camel and snake arms. The camera focused mostly on her face.  This is supposed to be an instructional video but there were too few body shots to display the technique.Dolphina has no business teaching belly dance.,1,She can't dance,1188259200,"08 28, 2007",2007,377,"['Dolphina', 'not', 'belly', 'dancer.She', 'not', 'flexible', 'technique', 'not', 'good', 'upper', 'lower', 'body', 'can', 'not', 'perform', 'most', 'moves', 'correctly', 'especially', 'camel', 'snake', 'arms', 'camera', 'focused', 'mostly', 'face', 'supposed', 'be', 'instructional', 'video', 'were', 'too', 'few', 'body', 'shots', 'display', 'technique.Dolphina', 'business', 'teaching', 'belly', 'dance']",The Goddess Workout: Introduction to Bellydance
