803005,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B0001FGBZM,Acute Observer,"[1, 2]","The Best of Abbott and Costello, Volume 2Bud Abbott and Lou Costello were the best comedy team in the movies of the 1940s and early 1950s. They were the best movie comedy team in 20th century America! There were other series of comic movies: Blondie and Dagwood, Hope and Crosby, Martin and Lewis. Aside from their physical differences, tall and thin versus short and stout (like Laurel and Hardy), their movies had a story that was relevant to society. The stories ranged over various geographic locations. Most of their films aged well. A movie is only as good as its story, so there are variations. The stories tell of the adventures of ordinary people and their interactions with society. [Was this why Jerry Seinfeld chose co-actors who were tall and thin, and short and stout?]Some of their movies became part of the ""public domain"" and are not in this series. Perhaps someday we will see these collected on a new volume. One reason for their success is that movie audiences peaked during their time. There are no recurring comedy series today. Talent seems to have gone into TV shows since the 1950s. There were comedy TV shows in the 1950s that were also funny (Red Skelton, ""I Love Lucy"", ""The Honeymooners"", etc.), but few comedy shows since the 1960s. The corporate media prefers dramas that stress crime and punishment. Does this produce a fear that best sells products? This lists the eight films on two double-sided DVDs. You can find detailed descriptions of each movie elsewhere.Hit the Ice (1943)In Society (1944)Here Come the Co-Eds (1945)The Naughty Nineties (1945)Little Giant (1946)The Time of Their Lives (1946)Buck Privates Come Home (1947)The Wistful Widow of Wagon Gap (1947)",5,The Greatest Comedy Team Ever,1286668800,"10 10, 2010",2010,1700,"['Best', 'Abbott', 'Costello', 'Volume', '2Bud', 'Abbott', 'Lou', 'Costello', 'were', 'best', 'comedy', 'team', 'movies', '1940s', 'early', '1950s', 'were', 'best', 'movie', 'comedy', 'team', '20th', 'century', 'America', 'were', 'other', 'series', 'comic', 'movies', 'Blondie', 'Dagwood', 'Hope', 'Crosby', 'Martin', 'Lewis', 'Aside', 'physical', 'differences', 'tall', 'thin', 'versus', 'short', 'stout', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', 'movies', 'had', 'story', 'was', 'relevant', 'society', 'stories', 'ranged', 'various', 'geographic', 'locations', 'Most', 'films', 'aged', 'well', 'movie', 'only', 'as', 'good', 'story', 'are', 'variations', 'stories', 'tell', 'adventures', 'ordinary', 'people', 'interactions', 'society', '[', 'Was', 'why', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'chose', 'co-actors', 'who', 'were', 'tall', 'thin', 'short', 'stout', 'movies', 'became', 'part', 'public', 'domain', 'are', 'not', 'series', 'Perhaps', 'someday', 'will', 'see', 'collected', 'new', 'volume', 'One', 'reason', 'success', 'movie', 'audiences', 'peaked', 'time', 'are', 'recurring', 'comedy', 'series', 'today', 'Talent', 'have', 'gone', 'TV', 'shows', '1950s', 'were', 'comedy', 'TV', 'shows', '1950s', 'were', 'also', 'funny', 'Red', 'Skelton', 'Love', 'Lucy', 'Honeymooners', 'etc', 'few', 'comedy', 'shows', '1960s', 'corporate', 'media', 'prefers', 'dramas', 'stress', 'crime', 'punishment', 'produce', 'fear', 'best', 'products', 'eight', 'films', 'two', 'double-sided', 'DVDs', 'can', 'find', 'detailed', 'descriptions', 'movie', 'Ice', '1943', 'Society', '1944', 'Here', 'Come', 'Co-Eds', '1945', 'Naughty', 'Nineties', '1945', 'Little', 'Giant', '1946', 'Time', 'Their', 'Lives', '1946', 'Buck', 'Privates', 'Come', 'Home', '1947', 'Wistful', 'Widow', 'Wagon', 'Gap', '1947']",The Best of Abbott & Costello - Volume 2 (Hit the Ice / In Society / Here Come the Co-Eds / The Naughty Nineties / Little Giant / and more)

803011,AAJTZPX7HDE5U,B0001FGBZM,Brian J Hay,"[24, 24]","Some of the situations the Hollywood movie machine contrived as vehicles for their stars show their age, often badly. Many of the ""chase"" sequences"" don't hold up at all. The runaway sailboat sequence in ""Here Come the Co-eds"" is an example of this. It has its moments. The close up shots of the live actors and the background footage they're superimposed on don't match each other. Details, things like wind moving fabric around, are missing. Often, the ""halos"" that were left around people when their images were superimposed over stock footage are still present. (It's still not always that easy to get rid of those perfectly even when with a still photograph. Ask someone who's done it.) The problems lie with the special effects. These were the state of the art in their time but are weak by current standards. This list goes on. Archival and stock footage (which was used a lot) is often grainy. Sometimes the resolution of pieces of film being matched is completely different. And so on ... Don't worry too much about all of this. Bud and Lou's comedy has too much too offer to let small technical issues stand in the way of enjoying what they did. The routines they inserted into their films are as fresh today as they were sixty years ago. The timing they had was impeccable; a lot of today's performers could learn from it. Some of the best performances of their routines captured on film are contained in this set. Every one shows how good their timing was. Watch and enjoy.Hit the Ice ****When Lou Costello walks into the door that bud Abbott just went through it's funny. When most duos do this it's not as funny, if it's even funny at all. That's timing. You turn on any of these movies knowing this is going to happen a lot. You expect it. You may even know it's coming. But, try to spot it coming. You can't. Their timing was that good. This film has a lot of hilarious sight gags. Lou walks into an inordinate amount of doors and walls. Watch Ginny Simms almost lose it when Lou realizes she's the one handing him his food. It was probably the closest thing to a take with her holding a straight face they could get. And the film contains a great version of ""pack the grip"".In Society ***Bud and Lou as plumbers: what trouble can they get into here? Watch and find out, but don't drink anything while the scene plays. It'll be coming up your nose when you break out laughing.Here Come the Co-Eds ***This one is a bit uneven. The comedy portions are excellent. Look for what's probably the best rendition of ""Jonah and the Whale"" on film. The basketball game is hilarious. What hurts the film are  some it's musical segments. Evelyn Silverstone's (Evelyn and her Magic Violin) solo spot is fine-she was an excellent violinist-but Phil Spitalny and his All-Girl Orchestra perform material that's beyond dreadful.The Naughty Nineties ****""Who's on First"" ...complete! The set was supposed to be silent for this. The cameramen couldn't do it. Listen for them laughing. The ""mirror routine"" is hilarious. And the chase at the end is zany and side splitting. One of their very best. This one is reviewed separately. It's that good.Little Giant ****Bud is splendid as the film's villain. He makes himself very easy to dislike. This film is more heart warming than hilarious though. That's not to say it isn't funny. Some parts are very funny. The sudden explosion of sales Lou has and his colleagues reaction to it is hilarious. He still surprises viewers constantly with the klutziness he gave to all his characters. And he proves himself as a dramatic actor. His character is one of life's victims and he's one who doesn't deserve to be. When his heart breaks the viewers' hearts break as well.The Time of Their Lives ****Bud has dual roles again, this time as both the hero and villain of the piece. He's brilliant in both roles. It's a good example of why Lou felt he was worth 60% of the money the team earned. He really was that good. As for Lou, well who else could be convincing as a ghost who can't figure out how to pass through walls? This film is another good example of why this pair is still finding new generations of fans.Buck Privates Come Home ****This film is all heart. The boys try to help a war orphan (not an unrealistic problem) but can't succeed on their own. Look for some touching scenes between Lou and the little girl and count on some fun while the film pokes fun at excessive authority. And enjoy some of the routines. Setting a table will never be the same again.The Wistful Widow of Wagon Gap ***This one features Marjorie Main of Ma and Pa kettle fame. She was a good comedienne and a good match to play opposite Bud and Lou. The funniest scenes in the movie are where she tries convincing (coercing) Lou into marrying her. His responses to everything she does are classic. Unfortunately some of the scenes where Lou gets to throw his weight around seem forced. Who's at fault there is hard to say but it looks like a decision made by the studio.",4,"As good as the first set, maybe even better.",1097884800,"10 16, 2004",2004,4990,"['situations', 'Hollywood',

They are on two double sided DVD's with two films on each side.  And if you like the boys, these are good films (not their best).***Hit the Ice - Bud and Lou are on the run and end up at a resort in Sun Valley.  They get jobs at the resort but the crooks follow.  The film ends up with a typical but still funny ski chase.**In Society - Bud and Lou are two incompetent plumbers who are called to fix a noisy toilet at a society home during a costume party.  They and their female taxi driver friend are mistaken for guests and are invited to a weekend in the county for the unveiling of a painting called ""The Plunger"".  When the painting is stolen, the boys find it.  Very typical and not that funny.***Here Comes the Co-ed's - Bud and Lou are employed at an all girl college and kaos ensues.  Of course, the college has financial  woes and in the end, the boys save the college.***Naughty Nineties - Bud and Lou's version of Show Boat.  Bud is a bad actor and Lou is the bumbling stagehand.  The river boat captain loses it to gamblers who turn it into a crooked casino.  Bud and Lou come to the rescue with what is becoming their typical chase scene (but this time it works perfectly.)  Also, they perform ""Who's on First"".****Little Giant - Lou is his typical simpleton who aspires to be a great salesman.  He leaves the farm and goes to the big city and gets a job as a door to door vacuum cleaner salesman for a company run by a corrupt Bud.  After a disastrous day Lou is exiled to the Fresno office run by Bud's twin brother who is honest.  By accident, Lou becomes the salesman of the year and returns to Los Angeles in triumph.  And of course, he uncovers the dishonesty going on, good Bud takes over and Lou returns to the farm and marries his sweetheart.  Very atypical fare and it works.****The Time of Their Lives - Lou and Marjorie Reynolds are revolutionary patriots killed by accident, branded as traitors and cursed to remain bound to the property until they are proved patriots.  Modern day, the mansion is restored and the new owners have moved in.  Ghosts Lou and Marjorie try to find the letter that will prove them patriots and set their spirits free.  Bud is the man who helped brand them traitors in the past and his distant relative in the present who helps prove them patriots.  This is one their better fares as it different from the typical fare.****Buck Privates Come Home - The war is over and the boys are coming home (with a little French orphan - who speaks perfect English!).  When she faces deportation, the boys and their friends hide her.  They only thing missing is the Andrew Sisters!*****The Wistful Widow of Wagon Gap - Lou gets credited with killing a bad guy but then is forced to marry his widow and be responsible for her children.  Marjorie Main of Ma Kettle Fame plays the widow and gives a great performance.  Bud plays a con artist that is conned into overseeing that Lou upholds his obligation to the widow and her family.DVD ExtrasProduction Notes and selected Trailers.

803034,A2F3M93RRLFQNJ,B0001FGBZM,mrliteral,"[3, 3]","It'd be a stretch to say that Abbott and Costello were the greatest comic actors ever, but they did put out a series of films that were both financially successful and a lot of fun to watch.  Volume 2 of the Abbott and Costello Franchise Collection provides eight movies featuring the pair and demonstrates how consistently entertaining they could be.On Disc One, Side One is Hit The Ice and In Society.  Hit the Ice has the two accused of bank robbery.  Fleeing the police, they wind up at the same ski lodge where the real crooks are.  This one concludes with a ski chase unlike any in a James Bond movie.  In Society has the pair as plumbers accidentally invited to a country estate where, during a weekend party, a valuable painting is to be unveiled.  When the painting is stolen, trouble is sure to follow, ending up with another chase, this time involving a fire truck.On Disc One, Side Two is Here Come the Co-Eds and The Naughty Nineties.  In the former, Bud and Lou wind up working at a women's college.  To raise funds to save the school, they bet on the basketball team, and Lou winds up impersonating one of the players.  This one also has Lon Chaney,  The Naughty Nineties has Bud and Lou trying to save a riverboat from falling into the hands of crooks.  This one is especially notable for having the full ""Who's on First"" routine, their single most well known bit of comedy.Disc Two, Side One features a couple of the most unusual A&C; movies, as the pair appear in the movies, but rarely together.  In Little Giant, Lou is an aspiring vacuum cleaner salesman and Bud has a pair of minor roles as two of Lou's bosses.  A showcase for Lou Costello, it has more sentimentality than most of their movies.  In The Time of Their Lives, Lou actually dies.  He spends most of the movie as a ghost from the Revolution out to clear his name.  Bud once again has dual roles, one in the 1780s and one in the 1940s.Disc Two, Side Two starts with Buck Privates Come Home, a sequel to the first movie featuring them, Buck Privates.  The pair come back from the war with a little orphan girl, and the two jump through hoops trying to keep her from being deported back to France.  The Wistful Widow of Wagon Gap is a western.  Lou apparently kills a man (of course, it's a frame-up) and is punished by having to take care of the dead man's fearsome wife and kids.

803036,A1M9DQDGE07Q0U,B0001FGBZM,Nix Pix,"[7, 9]","The Best Of Abbott & Costello: The Franchise Collection: Vol 2"" effectively gathers together another bumper crop of films that made up the middle of Bud and Lou's tenure at Universal Studios. Highlights on this two disc edition include the whimsical ""The Time Of Their Lives"" (1946), a film not well received in its time, but one which has proven to be an enduring classic in the A&C; canon.  Bud plays the dual role of Cuspert Greenway/Dr. Greenway, a footman in servitude to master Tom Danbury during the 1800s and his psychiatrist ancestor set in 1946. Cuspert?s treachery against Horatio (Lou Costello) results in his death and that of Tom?s finance, Mistress Melody (Marjorie Reynolds). From here on the story leaps forward to present day. Horatio and Melody, having been cursed upon their murders as traitors to America?s independence, remain bound to Danbury Acres until crack of doom. But when they begin to haunt Dr. Greenway and his guests living at the refurbished historical landmark, a ray of hope develops that might finally set their spirits free. In ""Here Come The Co-Eds"" (1945)  Bud and Lou are a couple of caretakers, hiding out from the police at Bixby College, an all girl's school. The film features The Hour Of Enchantment, all girl?s orchestra and choir and a riotous basketball game in which Lou, after being hit on the head, believes that he is Daisy Dimple; the world?s greatest female basketball player. In ""Hit The Ice"" (1943) - the boys take off to Sun Valley for skiing, a prospect that falls apart when a mob boss decides to hide out at the same resort. This collection also features a handful of awful films. ""The Wistful Widow of Wagon Gap"" (1947) is a genuinely boring film in which Lou attempts to win the heart of a crotchety widow (Marjorie Maine) in order to secure her wealthy fortune, but whose adult children have other ideas.  Lou generally gets abused by everyone in the cast and there?s a genuine strain on the relationship between A&C; by this time. In ""The Naughty Nineties"" (1945) Bud and Lou are performers on a riverboat, but the only salvation from this film is an extended version of the now legendary 'Who's On First' skit. (*Footnote: 'Who's on First' is performed in a truncated version in ""One Night In The Tropics"" also. That film is available on ""The Best Of...Vol. One"".) The bad lot of apples reaches its rotten core with ?Little Giant? (1946), a really boring hodge-podge in which Lou is a vacuum cleaner salesman working for Bud. This collection is rounded out by a couple of mediocre productions; ?In Society? (1944), a trifle in which the boys crash a society party to help a chorus girl fall in love with a rich playboy, and ?Buck Privates Come Home? (1947), a rehash of skits from previous films with the tack on of having Bud and Lou smuggle a little French girl back to America after the war.Over all, the transfers in this collection are a mixed bag in image quality. While some films like ""The Time of Their Lives"" exhibit little to no age related artifacts, others like ""The Wistful Widow..."" have not worn well at all. At its worst you will get a transfer riddled in age related artifacts, minor edge enhancement, mis-registration and considerable film grain. At its best, the picture quality is outstanding - leading me to think that some of these transfers were blessed with a meticulous digital restoration, while others got shafted. The audio for all the films is MONO but very nicely presented.",3,INCONSISTANT IMAGE QUALITY - STILL FUNNY!,1083715200,"05 5, 2004",2004,3471,"['Best', 'Abbott', 'Costello', 'Franchise', 'Collection', '2', 'effectively', 'together', 'bumper', 'crop', 'films', 'made', 'up', 'middle', 'Bud', 'Lou', 'tenure', 'Universal', 'Studios', 'Highlights', 'two', 'disc', 'edition', 'include', 'whimsical', 'Time', 'Their', 'Lives', '1946', 'film', 'not', 'well', 'received', 'time', 'one', 'proven', 'be', 'enduring', 'classic', 'A', 'C', 'canon', 'Bud', 'dual', 'role', 'Cuspert', 'Greenway/Dr', 'Greenway', 'footman', 'servitude', 'master', 'Tom', 'Danbury', '1800s', 'psychiatrist', 'ancestor', 'set', '1946', 'Cuspert', 's', 'treachery', 'Horatio', 'Lou', 'Costello', 'results', 'death', 'Tom', 's', 'finance', 'Mistress', 'Melody', 'Marjorie', 'Reynolds', 'here', 'story', 'forward', 'present', 'day', 'Horatio', 'Melody', 'having', 'been', 'cursed', 'murders', 'traitors', 'America', 's', 'independence', 'remain', 'bound', 'Danbury', 'Acres', 'crack', 'doom', 'when', 'begin', 'haunt', 'Dr.', 'Greenway', 'guests', 'living', 'refurbished', 'historical', 'landmark', 'ray', 'hope', 'might', 'finally', 'set', 'spirits', 'free', 'Here', 'Come', 'Co-Eds', '1945', 'Bud', 'Lou', 'are', 'couple', 'caretakers', 'hiding', 'out', 'police', 'Bixby', 'College', 'girl', 'school', 'film', 'Hour', 'Enchantment', 'girl', 's', 'orchestra', 'choir', 'riotous', 'basketball', 'game', 'Lou', 'being', 'hit', 'head', 'Daisy', 'Dimple', 'world', 's', 'greatest', 'female', 'basketball', 'player', 'Hit', 'Ice', '1943', 'boys', 'take', 'off', 'Sun', 'Valley', 'skiing', 'prospect', 'apart', 'when', 'mob', 'boss', 'hide', 'out', 'same', 'resort', 'collection', 'also', 'handful', 'awful', 'films', 'Wistful', 'Widow', 'Wagon', 'Gap', '1947', 'genuinely', 'boring', 'film', 'Lou', 'win', 'heart', 'crotchety', 'widow', 'Marjorie', 'Maine', 'order', 'secure', 'wealthy', 'fortune', 'adult', 'children', 'have', 'other', 'ideas', 'Lou', 'generally', 'abused', 'everyone', 'cast', 'there', 's', 'genuine', 'strain', 'relationship', 'A', 'C', 'time', 'Naughty', 'Nineties', '1945', 'Bud', 'Lou', 'are', 'performers', 'riverboat', 'only', 'salvation', 'film', 'extended', 'version', 'now', 'legendary', 'First', 'skit', '*Footnote', 'First', 'performed', 'truncated', 'version', 'One', 'Night', 'Tropics', 'also', 'film', 'available', 'Best', 'Vol', 'One', 'bad', 'lot', 'apples', 'rotten', 'core', 'Little', 'Giant', '1946', 'really', 'boring', 'hodge-podge', 'Lou', 'vacuum', 'cleaner', 'salesman', 'working', 'Bud', 'collection', 'rounded', 'out', 'couple', 'mediocre', 'productions', 'Society', '1944', 'trifle', 'boys', 'crash', 'society', 'party', 'help', 'chorus', 'girl', 'fall', 'love', 'rich', 'playboy', 'Buck', 'Come', 'Home', '1947', 'rehash', 'skits', 'previous', 'films', 'tack', 'having', 'Bud', 'Lou', 'smuggle', 'little', 'French', 'girl', 'back', 'America', 'war.Over', 'transfers', 'collection', 'are', 'mixed', 'bag', 'image', 'quality', 'films', 'Time', 'Their', 'Lives', 'exhibit', 'little', 'age', 'related', 'artifacts', 'others', 'Wistful', 'Widow', 'have', 'not', 'worn', 'well', 'worst', 'will', 'get', 'transfer', 'riddled', 'age', 'related', 'artifacts', 'minor', 'edge', 'enhancement', 'mis-registration', 'considerable', 'film', 'grain', 'best', 'picture', 'quality', 'outstanding', 'leading', 'think', 'transfers', 'were', 'blessed', 'meticulous', 'digital', 'restoration', 'others', 'got', 'shafted', 'audio', 'films', 'MONO', 'very', 'nicely', 'presented']",The Best of Abbott & Costello - Volume 2 (Hit the Ice / In Society / Here Come the Co-Eds / The Naughty Nineties / Little Giant / and more)

They intrigued me, so I decided to purchase this set.  The first shipment had a defective first disc (the first movie on both sides skipped, the second movie on both sides did not play at all on either of my DVD players), so I returned it to Amazon and got a replacement, which worked fine.The four movies on disc 1 (HIT THE ICE, IN SOCIETY, HERE COME THE CO-EDS, and THE NAUGHTY NINETIES) are musical comedies, more or less.  Of the four movies on disc 2, LITTLE GIANT and THE TIME OF THEIR LIVES are what I would consider ""dramedies""; while they have plenty of funny moments, Bud and Lou play separate roles and show their dramatic acting talents, particularly Costello.  BUCK PRIVATES COME HOME (a sequel to BUCK PRIVATES) is a military comedy; THE WISTFUL WIDOW OF WAGON GAP is a Western.A number of well-known supporting players appear in these pictures, including Marion Hutton (Glenn Miller's girl vocalist), Arthur Treacher (British character actor and Merv Griffin's '60s sidekick), George Dolenz (Micky's dad), Peggy Ryan (the secretary in the original ""Hawaii Five-O"" and a fabulous tap dancer - see HERE COME THE CO-EDS), Milburn Stone (Doc of ""Gunsmoke"" fame), and many others.My two favorites are HERE COME THE CO-EDS and THE NAUGHTY NINETIES (which has the complete version of A&C;'s ""Who's on First"" routine, which never gets old - the YouTube version is from the A&C; TV series, I believe).

If someone is only interested in owning, say, THE NAUGHTY NINETIES, why should they have to purchase seven other movies that they are not interested in?I'm going to check the other volumes in the series to see if they are worthwhile.",4,Good collection of A&C movies,1326499200,"01 14, 2012",2012,1875,"['have', 'been', 'watching', 'Bud', 'Abbott', 'Lou', 'Costello', 'movies', 'ThisTV', 'digital', 'subchannel', 'intrigued', 'decided', 'purchase', 'set', 'first', 'shipment', 'had', 'defective', 'first', 'disc', 'first', 'movie', 'sides', 'skipped', 'second', 'movie', 'sides', 'did', 'not', 'play', 'DVD', 'players', 'so', 'returned', 'Amazon', 'got', 'replacement', 'worked', 'fine.The', 'four', 'movies', 'disc', '1', 'HIT', 'THE', 'ICE', 'IN', 'SOCIETY', 'HERE', 'COME', 'THE', 'CO-EDS', 'THE', 'NAUGHTY', 'NINETIES', 'are', 'musical', 'comedies', 'more', 'less', 'four', 'movies', 'disc', '2', 'LITTLE', 'GIANT', 'THE', 'TIME', 'OF', 'THEIR', 'LIVES', 'are', 'what', 'would', 'consider', 'dramedies', 'have', 'plenty', 'funny', 'moments', 'Bud', 'Lou', 'play', 'separate', 'roles', 'show', 'dramatic', 'acting', 'talents', 'particularly', 'Costello', 'BUCK', 'PRIVATES', 'COME', 'HOME', 'sequel', 'BUCK', 'PRIVATES', 'military', 'comedy', 'THE', 'WISTFUL', 'WIDOW', 'OF', 'WAGON', 'GAP', 'Western.A', 'number', 'well-known', 'supporting', 'players', 'appear', 'pictures', 'including', 'Marion', 'Hutton', 'Glenn', 'Miller', 'girl', 'vocalist', 'Arthur', 'Treacher', 'British', 'character', 'actor', 'Merv', 'Griffin', ""'60s"", 'sidekick', 'George', 'Dolenz', 'Micky', 'dad', 'Peggy', 'Ryan', 'secretary', 'original', 'Hawaii', 'Five-O', 'fabulous', 'tap', 'dancer', 'see', 'HERE', 'COME', 'THE', 'CO-EDS', 'Milburn', 'Stone', 'Doc', 'Gunsmoke', 'fame', 'many', 'others.My', 'two', 'favorites', 'are', 'HERE', 'COME', 'THE', 'CO-EDS', 'THE', 'NAUGHTY', 'NINETIES', 'complete', 'version', 'A', 'C', 'Who', 'First', 'routine', 'never', 'old', 'YouTube', 'version', 'A', 'C', 'TV', 'series', 'believe', 'enjoyed', 'pictures', 'though.I', 'do', 'wish', 'Universal', 'would', 'release', 'least', 'pictures', 'individual', 'DVDs', 'someone', 'only', 'interested', 'owning', 'say', 'NAUGHTY', 'NINETIES', 'why', 'should', 'have', 'purchase', 'seven', 'other', 'movies', 'are', 'not', 'interested', ""'m"", 'going', 'check', 'other', 'volumes', 'series', 'see', 'are', 'worthwhile']",The Best of Abbott & Costello - Volume 2 (Hit the Ice / In Society / Here Come the Co-Eds / The Naughty Nineties / Little Giant / and more)

803049,A3A81ZZ4ANLZ8G,B0001FGBZM,"The Critic ""Movie Maniac""","[3, 3]","This is a great follow up set to ""Abbott & Costello"" Volume 1.Once again the picture and sound are clear and crisp and better than I remember them being on any television broadcast. I now have 8 more movies in my collection for less than I paid for the ""Abbott & Costello meet the Mummy"" DVD, and I don't see that title or A & C meet Captain Kidd on the scheduled volume 3 release. As with volume 1 some reviewers have had more quality issues and disc problems, fortunately I haven't had any so far. As for putting 8 movies on 2 discs, I am not a big fan of this format either. But I think if Universal was to release 8 movies on 4 disc's it would definitely drive the price up. There really aren't any extra's to speak of, some production notes and a few trailers. It sure would be nice to have commentaries from surviving A & C family members to hear their thoughts on one of the best comedy teams ever created. Through the magic of DVD media and these fantastic volumes, new legions of fans are discovering ""Abbott & Costello"" for the first time. If your a fan of Abbott & Costello or have never seen their films you need to buy this set. These movies are hilarious and pure fun for the whole family.
