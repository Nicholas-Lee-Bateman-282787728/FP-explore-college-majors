Then there's the usual dealing with the husband and his threats to take her son (who badly needs a haircut).

This is a really enjoyable French movie - not particularly light hearted, but instead a realistic look at a woman going through a personal turmoil - however, it does have a happy ending!As with many other lesbian films I have seen, it is not top of the list on production value, but on the whole the acting is pretty decent.

840118,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0002MFG7S,Grady Harp,"[5, 5]","AMOUR DE FEMME is a well-produced film that deals with the trials and agonies facing women who come out as lesbians.  It is quiet, subtle, beautifully photographed, and is fortunate to have a fine, handsome cast directed with sensitivity by Sylvie Verheyde who also wrote the simple but elegant screenplay.Made in 2001 AMOUR DE FEMME came to the screen before the popular US television series THE L WORD, a program that has provided a healthier look at same sex relationships between women, and though there have been successful mainstream lesbian films, this particular one avoids some of the pitfalls that have prevented wide public acceptance of the others.  The writer/director does not surround her two main characters with the usual bar scenes and peripheral characters that can distract from the story of a sexual discovery, but instead keeps the story tight with a small cast each of whom makes an impact on the story.Jeanne (H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Filli&egrave;res) is a successful osteopath/wife/mother who happens to reluctantly accompany her handsome husband David (Anthony Delon) to a birthday party for his best friend Franck (Jeannick Gravelines) and there she encounters Marie (Raffala Anderson), a dancer, and a chemistry develops resulting in an evening Jeanne enjoys very much. Slowly Jeanne and Marie begin meeting very openly, Jeanne is honest with David about her comings and goings, but when the two women's relationship becomes physical, Jeanne is faced with decisions about her sexuality.  David confronts Jeanne about Marie, Jeanne confides her shaky mental and physical state, and when David eventually confronts Jeanne in a telling way, Jeanne understands her true self and despite her deep love for her small child, realizes she must follow her heart.The cinematography both in Paris and in Normandy, where Jeanne and Marie with Marie's younger brother Mose (Thierno Sy) have spent refreshing moments together, is stunning.  Both of the actresses are not only beautiful but also talented and yield a credible attraction and passion.  The entire cast is superb.  The one distracting element in the film is the sound track: there is a rumbling pedal point noise that accompanies almost every scene between Jeanne and Marie and is annoyingly distracting.  In French with English subtitles.  The DVD is very fine in execution, but there are not extras except for some video trailers.  A comment from the talented writer/director would have enhanced the release.  Recommended.

840119,ASJZIXGRCKBHZ,B0002MFG7S,"happykat ""Voracious reader and movie fanatic""","[144, 153]","After a 12 year dry spell, I finally found an lesbian movie that I could REALLY ENJOY!!! (This hasn't happened since, ""When Night is Falling."")Amour de Femme (Love of Women) is about a Parisian women named Jeanne who seems to have it all, namely she is good looking, has a fabulous looking husband, an adorable and loving kid, and a very successful career as an osteopath. The actress who plays Jeanne (the lead character) looks like an amalgamation of Sean Young, Phoebe Cates, Teri Hatcher (brown hair and eyes) and has the amazing ability to appear very different (facial wise) in every shot she's in. I've never seen an actress that has the ability to look different in every shot. The actress who plays Jeanne is about 6 ft. tall and lanky (I LOVE TALL WOMEN! &lt;G>)The film begins with Jeanne and her hubby David attending a birthday party at a bar in Paris. As soon as they walk in, David quickly abandons his wife to hang out with his buddies, leaving Jeanne to fend for herself. She looks alone and uncomfortable in the packed room and the viewer gets the impression that Jeanne being ditched by her husband is a very common occurrence. However, what next happens will change Jeanne's life forever. As the party progresses, a short female dancer comes out onto a well lighted stage in the bar and starts dancing very provocatively for the audience. She has been hired to entertain the birthday boy and very quickly strips off most of her clothing (besides a fancy bra and panties.) In the meantime, Jeanne is watching the dancer avidly from the shadows - a first with a blank face and moments later a smile appears on her face ... After the show, we see Jeanne aimlessly walking by herself through a crowd of people, looking bored and lonely. When she walks through a festooned entryway of the bar, she immediately feels someone behind her, startling her. She quickly turns around and she sees it's the dancer. From that point on (about 3 minutes into the film) to the end of the movie, Jeanne and Marie can't take their eyes off each other and form a mutual admiration society. The looks shared between these two women are so intense and erotic, that the nap hairs on my neck stand up every time I watch this movie. Jeanne sees Marie as the embodiment of passion, energy, and freedom and we are along for the ride as she explores her new found passion for a Marie.  This is one of the first lesbian movies where I've seen desire, tenderness, and caring overtly demonstrated between two women over the course of the entire movie. I also thought that the dialogue in this movie was realistic, romantic, and compelling.HOWEVER, I want to add that I DO NOT think Amour de Femme is a perfect movie, because it isn't. The music soundtrack of this movie is supremely annoying, distracting, very loud and inappropriate (like a previous reviewer said, it sounds like a soundtrack from a porno movie), especially at the expense of hearing the dialogue between the characters (thank God for subtitles!!) It also cheapens the intense scenes of emotion between the two women.  In addition, both the women in this film smoke, and you can tell they both do this in real life by their grayish teeth. I guess they never heard of teeth whitening in France. (I'm picky I know - so sue me!) Additionally, some of the camera work in the film is very mediocre. I was repeatedly distracted when the camera went for a close up shot of an actor when the camera should have panned back so the audience could see both the emotional reactions of the women. There are also several scenes where the viewer can only see a chin or mouth of one of the actresses, and the full face of the other, leaving the reaction of the other actress a complete mystery. I also think the actress who plays Jeanne is MUCH better looking and a MUCH better actor than the female who plays Marie.  I dearly wish they would have chosen a better looking and acting actress for her part, instead of one who smirks through most of her scenes.  Be that as it may, if you are looking for a romantic LESBIAN film, with realistic dialogue, scenes of intense, tender and erotic emotion, and one short love scene, this film is for you. Despite my criticisms, I really enjoyed this film and it's a definite keeper.",4,"Finally, a romantic LESBIAN movie !!",1108512000,"02 16, 2005",2005,4263,"['12', 'year', 'dry', 'spell', 'finally', 'found', 'lesbian', 'movie', 'could', 'REALLY', 'ENJOY', ""n't"", 'happened', 'When', 'Night', 'Falling', 'Amour', 'de', 'Femme', 'Love', 'Women', 'Parisian', 'women', 'named', 'Jeanne', 'who', 'have', 'namely', 'good', 'looking', 'fabulous', 'looking', 'husband', 'adorable', 'loving', 'kid', 'very', 'successful', 'career', 'osteopath', 'actress', 'who', 'Jeanne', 'lead', 'character', 'amalgamation', 'Sean', 'Young', 'Phoebe', 'Cates', 'Teri', 'Hatcher', 'brown', 'hair', 'eyes', 'amazing', 'ability', 'appear', 'very', 'different', 'facial', 'wise', 'shot', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'actress', 'ability', 'look', 'different', 'shot', 'actress', 'who', 'Jeanne', '6', 'ft.', 'tall', 'lanky', 'LOVE', 'TALL', 'WOMEN', 'lt', 'G', '>', 'film', 'Jeanne', 'hubby', 'David', 'attending', 'birthday', 'party', 'bar', 'Paris', 'As', 'soon', 'walk', 'David', 'quickly', 'wife', 'hang', 'out', 'buddies', 'leaving', 'Jeanne', 'fend', 'herself', 'alone', 'uncomfortable', 'packed', 'room', 'viewer', 'impression', 'Jeanne', 'being', 'ditched', 'husband', 'very', 'common', 'occurrence', 'However', 'what', 'next', 'happens', 'will', 'change', 'Jeanne', 'life', 'forever', 'party', 'short', 'female', 'dancer', 'out', 'well', 'lighted', 'stage', 'bar', 'dancing', 'very', 'provocatively', 'audience', 'been', 'hired', 'entertain', 'birthday', 'boy', 'very', 'quickly', 'strips', 'off', 'most', 'clothing', 'fancy', 'bra', 'panties', 'meantime', 'Jeanne', 'watching', 'dancer', 'avidly', 'shadows', 'first', 'blank', 'face', 'moments', 'later', 'smile', 'face', 'show', 'see', 'Jeanne', 'aimlessly', 'walking', 'crowd', 'people', 'looking', 'bored', 'lonely', 'When', 'walks', 'festooned', 'entryway', 'bar', 'immediately', 'someone', 'startling', 'quickly', 'around', 'dancer', 'point', '3', 'minutes', 'film', 'end', 'movie', 'Jeanne', 'Marie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'eyes', 'other', 'form', 'mutual', 'admiration', 'society', 'looks', 'shared', 'two', 'women', 'are', 'so', 'intense', 'erotic', 'nap', 'hairs', 'neck', 'stand', 'up', 'time', 'watch', 'movie', 'Jeanne', 'Marie', 'embodiment', 'passion', 'energy', 'freedom', 'are', 'along', 'ride', 'new', 'found', 'passion', 'Marie', 'one', 'first', 'lesbian', 'movies', 'where', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'desire', 'tenderness', 'caring', 'overtly', 'demonstrated', 'two', 'women', 'course', 'entire', 'movie', 'also', 'thought', 'dialogue', 'movie', 'was', 'realistic', 'romantic', 'compelling.HOWEVER', 'want', 'add', 'DO', 'NOT', 'think', 'Amour', 'de', 'Femme', 'perfect', 'movie', ""n't"", 'music', 'soundtrack', 'movie', 'supremely', 'annoying', 'distracting', 'very', 'loud', 'inappropriate', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'said', 'soundtrack', 'porno', 'movie', 'especially', 'expense', 'hearing', 'dialogue', 'characters', 'thank', 'God', 'subtitles', 'also', 'intense', 'scenes', 'emotion', 'two', 'women', 'addition', 'women', 'film', 'smoke', 'can', 'tell', 'do', 'real', 'life', 'grayish', 'teeth', 'guess', 'never', 'heard', 'teeth', 'whitening', 'France', ""'m"", 'picky', 'know', 'so', 'sue', 'Additionally', 'camera', 'work', 'film', 'very', 'mediocre', 'was', 'repeatedly', 'distracted', 'when', 'camera', 'went', 'close', 'up', 'shot', 'actor', 'when', 'camera', 'should', 'have', 'panned', 'back', 'audience', 'could', 'see', 'emotional', 'reactions', 'women', 'are', 'also', 'several', 'scenes', 'where', 'viewer', 'can', 'only', 'see', 'chin', 'mouth', 'one', 'actresses', 'full', 'face', 'other', 'leaving', 'reaction', 'other', 'actress', 'complete', 'mystery', 'also', 'think', 'actress', 'who', 'Jeanne', 'MUCH', 'better', 'looking', 'MUCH', 'better', 'actor', 'female', 'who', 'Marie', 'dearly', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'chosen', 'better', 'looking', 'acting', 'actress', 'part', 'instead', 'one', 'who', 'most', 'scenes', 'Be', 'may', 'are', 'looking', 'romantic', 'LESBIAN', 'film', 'realistic', 'dialogue', 'scenes', 'intense', 'tender', 'erotic', 'emotion', 'one', 'short', 'love', 'scene', 'film', 'criticisms', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'definite', 'keeper']",Amour de Femme

These leads were very pretty and appealing and shared some nice chemistry. And I think that made the movie much better than it would have been otherwise. I was a little slow getting into it, but these two are so lovely and seemed really into each other and so it picked up for me rather quick. And my goodness... the French! Sounds so very sexy!! ;)Jeanne is married and has a handsome husband of 8 years, a young son, and a successful career as an osteopath. She seems content enough in her life. However, one evening when she goes to a party with her husband, she meets dancer/dance instructor Marie and she is intrigued. A friendship develops and they openly spend time together... despite class and race differences (Marie is mixed, black/white), these two really hit it off. Marie also has experience with women whereas Jeanne does not. There is a gentle and honest chemistry between these two that gave their romance a genuine feel as they begin to develop some serious emotions for each other.This is not some sleazy extramarital affair. Jeanne begins to examine her sexuality and reflect on her life choices. Some drama ensues. Really, it's a coming out story and I appreciated this wasn't all about cheating, lying, and quickie sex (though I can love those stories too!). It's a love story. And there is a happy ending. Not too shabby for 2001.There is one sorta kinda graphic sex scene, but not full on nudity (chest only)... tastefully done. Jeanne is a tall and lovely woman with that girl-next-door something... and Marie is a sexy little thing. Nice match. I just adored their height differences... especially in the last scene.

840123,A3D09XGX4FOLSB,B0002MFG7S,KinoChelovek,"[0, 0]","I bought this movie because I study foreign movies.  I have seen many great lesbian-centered features from Europe, including Germany's ""Four Minutes"" and Spain's ""My Mother Likes Women.""  I saw ""Baise-Moi""(a movie definitely NOT for everyone!) which also co-stars the ex-porn actress Raffaella Anderson.  She is the reason to see this movie: Her facial expressions are quite good, and she needs no dialogue to make her point, and that is her acting strength.  Too bad she has only done a couple of ""legit"" movies, because she has talent, but is probably stigmatized for her x-rated work.This movie deals with a married woman (with a son), Jeanne (Fillieres) whose life is pretty much boring and uneventful.  She meets Marie (Anderson), a dancer who finds Jeanne attractive.  Jeanne wants to return to dancing, and her husband, David (Delon) approves.  However, David is always away on business trips.  Jeanne and Marie decide to take a trip to Normandy to see Marie's brother.  They begin an illicit affair which is found out by David.  He forces his wife to decide between him and Marie.  She breaks up from Marie.  Who will Jeanne decide between?  Well, that's all I will reveal about the plot.As I watched this 2001 film, I looked like a low-budget 70s feature.  The yellows in the scenes, along with the graininess of the stock, made the movie look and feel old, and the narrative certainly enhanced that ""outdated"" feel.  There is no originality to the movie's narrative:  Bored housewife finds husband distant, finds another who shows some interest, and commits adultery.  Husband finds out, wife separates from lover, but who will she choose between?  Just so it has a lesbian relationship, should the viewer love the movie even more?  I do not believe so.  Its run-of-the-mill shaky-marriage story is flat.  Even though I really enjoy Anderson's acting ability, everyone seems to be in a perpetual state of brooding.  The lesbian relationship in itself feels realistic, but the low-budget feel kills that reality rather quickly.I tried to like this movie, but was disappointed at its lack of imagination.

The two women have a love affair, much to the dismay of Jeanne's husband David.There's not much in the way of sex scenes (or even nudity) in this film, but what's there is very well done and very erotically charged.

840126,A3NJDTIEZY1I06,B0002MFG7S,"S. Stinson ""book lover""","[71, 73]","""Amour de Femme"" is one of those rare movies that are moody, subtle, and yet powerful all at the same time. A French film with English subtitles, ""Amour de Femme"" tells the story of Jeanne, a 35-year-old masseuse living in Paris, who has spent her entire life making other people feel better. Attending a party with David, her husband of seven years, Jeanne instantly connects with Marie, a dancer performing at the party. They spend the evening conversing about their love of dance, something Jeanne used to do, but has given up as her life took a different turn. Vowing to begin dancing again, Jeanne decides to take one of Marie's classes, and rediscovers not only the passion that's been missing from her life, but that she has feelings for this mesmerizing woman.Although Jeanne's past is never explained, one gets the sense of a life of quiet desperation. Jeanne seems to be happy on the surface, but dig a little deeper and one finds a woman whose passion for life has fizzled out. She goes through the motions, living each day as she is expected--dutiful wife to David, loving mother to young Louis--until she meets Marie. Intrigued by the vitality of this woman, Jeanne undergoes a transformation that, at first, she finds confusing and frightening. Marie makes no secret of her attraction to women--and to Jeanne--and Jeanne, while drawn to her, struggles with conflicting emotions, eventually running back home to the safety of the known.The distance between Jeanne and her husband continues to grow, and Jeanne finds herself thinking of Marie more and more; the quiet desperation invading her every waking moment. She again finds herself at Marie's class, this time taking her up on an offer for dinner. They go to Marie's apartment where she begins to prepare dinner for the two, when Jeanne boldly decides to ask Marie to kiss her. The tender kiss in turn leads to a night of lovemaking between the two. They continue having clandestine rendezvous for several weeks, and one can see the joy growing in Jeanne's life at her newfound feelings.It's only a matter of time before Jeanne finds herself in love with Marie, torn between the life she had and the one she is creating with Marie.  The ensuing drama that occurs between Jeanne and David as she takes steps that will radically change her life, are intense and passionate. During the next few scenes, we see an entirely different Jeanne as she makes up her mind, finds herself, and makes decisions that will change her life forever.""Amour de Femme"" stars Helene Fillieres as Jeanne. At first, I thought the actress portraying Marie was very short, but further investigation revealed that Fillieres is actually six-feet tall! She reminds me of a young Gia Carangi in many shots, having that androgynous beauty about her. Fillieres, as Jeanne, is a formidable screen presence: her stormy beauty simultaneously suggesting the terror with which she at first cowers from love's promise, then lunges at it hungrily, epitomizing Jeanne's greatest question in life: who is this woman that I am becoming?Raffaela Anderson portrayal of Marie is the very picture of courageous self-determination, whether romancing Jeanne in quiet conversation, or wildly dancing with a commanding ferocity.I found ""Amour de Femme"" to be highly reminiscent of another favorite movie of mine, ""When Night is Falling."" Both of these movies tend toward subtlety and imagery to tell their stories instead of hand-holding the viewer with endless dialogue and background explanations. If you like your movies spelled out in great detail, you probably won't like ""Amour de Femme"" or ""When Night is Falling."" ""Amour de Femme"" is the kind of movie that you think about, watch again, and enjoy even more the second time around as you capture the nuance of the wonderful performance.One thing to remember when watching this film is that it is a foreign film and not necessarily up to Hollywood cinematic standards. The musical soundtrack leaves quite a bit to be desired, bordering on tastelessly pornographic, and the coloring of the movie tends toward dark and moody.Nevertheless, if you can get past the technical inadequacies of the film, you will find yourself immersed in a beautiful, moving love story about the ""love of women.""
