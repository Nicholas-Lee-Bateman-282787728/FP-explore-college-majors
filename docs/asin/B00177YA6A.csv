I'm not sure if it's coincidence of Graham's preferences, but she always seems to play a desperate woman who seems to shed any sex appeal she had with her personality. Moreover, the movie just isn't that funny. There's only so much of sad, pathetic loser one can take before it stops being funny.",2,Another Heather Graham bomb,1315094400,"09 4, 2011",2011,470,"['feel', 'post-Austin', 'Powers', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'movies', 'are', 'same', 'Graham', 'character', 'mopes', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'find', 'guy', 'have', 'baby', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'coincidence', 'Graham', 'preferences', 'always', 'play', 'desperate', 'woman', 'who', 'shed', 'sex', 'appeal', 'had', 'personality', 'Moreover', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'funny', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'sad', 'pathetic', 'loser', 'one', 'can', 'take', 'being', 'funny']",Miss Conception

In a drought of movies, desperate for something funny, diverting, hopefully romantic(too much to ask?), I found this surprisingly, entertaining and unknown flick in a lonely 'Red Box'.The premise: a thirty-something, construction running, successful woman with a family history of early menopause and desperate for a baby, breaks up with her handsome, film documentary boyfriend because he's not sure he wants to go the family way.  By the magic of modern medicine, she then discovers her biological clock almost ticked out with only one more ovum/egg remaining.  Her friends devise a madcap scheme for her to either A. shack up with someone ASAP, i.e., one night standish, or B. sperm bank it.For reasons not totally explained, she initially opts for Plan A, but then it deteriorates into whatever will get the job done, so to speak.  She pines for her ex, but he's stuck and unreachable in the Aran Islands, Ireland being pursued by his catty but sexy assistant(Ruta Gedmintas).Whatever can go wrong goes wrong as Heather Graham's character searches out potential 'donors'.So, it sounds like a pretty, amoral tale, and it is until the end, but there's an old fashion kind of romance going on in wolf's clothing.  The story's inane.  The idea of urgently sleeping around in order to get pregnant is frightening in reality, but the movie's a gimmick for laughs, and it is funny.I like Heather Graham.  She usually plays in quirky, somewhat unknown movies.  There's no nudity, some language, and lots of suggestive situations which give it the R-rating.  I'd give it a 3-Star except, I love Orlando Seale who plays her gay, reluctant friend.  I remember him from a LDS made film, ""Pride and Prejudice"" which is actually pretty good.  He's a wonderful, multi-talented, Shakespearean actor with a gift for comedy.Bottom line: a silly, English, romantic comedy that ultimately follows the romantic comedy format, all's well that ends well.  Enjoy it when you're at a lost what to watch.",4,Scary concept but funny romantic comedy,1225756800,"11 4, 2008",2008,2023,"['Let', 'go', 'common', 'sense', 'watching', 'drought', 'movies', 'desperate', 'something', 'funny', 'diverting', 'hopefully', 'romantic', 'too', 'much', 'ask', 'found', 'surprisingly', 'entertaining', 'unknown', 'flick', 'lonely', ""'Red"", ""Box'.The"", 'premise', 'thirty-something', 'construction', 'running', 'successful', 'woman', 'family', 'history', 'early', 'menopause', 'desperate', 'baby', 'up', 'handsome', 'film', 'documentary', 'boyfriend', 'not', 'sure', 'go', 'family', 'way', 'magic', 'modern', 'medicine', 'then', 'biological', 'clock', 'almost', 'ticked', 'out', 'only', 'one', 'more', 'ovum/egg', 'remaining', 'friends', 'devise', 'madcap', 'scheme', 'A.', 'shack', 'up', 'someone', 'ASAP', 'i.e.', 'one', 'night', 'standish', 'B.', 'sperm', 'bank', 'it.For', 'reasons', 'not', 'totally', 'explained', 'initially', 'opts', 'Plan', 'A', 'then', 'will', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'so', 'speak', 'ex', 'stuck', 'unreachable', 'Aran', 'Islands', 'Ireland', 'being', 'pursued', 'catty', 'sexy', 'assistant', 'Ruta', 'Gedmintas', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'wrong', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'character', 'out', 'potential', ""'donors'.So"", 'pretty', 'amoral', 'tale', 'end', 'old', 'fashion', 'kind', 'romance', 'going', 'wolf', 'clothing', 'story', 'inane', 'idea', 'urgently', 'sleeping', 'around', 'order', 'get', 'pregnant', 'frightening', 'reality', 'movie', 'gimmick', 'laughs', 'funny.I', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'usually', 'quirky', 'somewhat', 'unknown', 'movies', 'nudity', 'language', 'lots', 'suggestive', 'situations', 'give', 'R-rating', ""'d"", 'give', '3-Star', 'love', 'Orlando', 'Seale', 'who', 'gay', 'reluctant', 'friend', 'remember', 'LDS', 'made', 'film', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'wonderful', 'multi-talented', 'Shakespearean', 'actor', 'gift', 'comedy.Bottom', 'line', 'silly', 'English', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'ultimately', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'format', 'well', 'well', 'Enjoy', 'when', ""'re"", 'lost', 'what', 'watch']",Miss Conception

She does a really good job of the British accent and truly gives Renee Zellweger a run for her money on the Hollywood actress goes British. This was a really great performance and she looks great as ever. This film was way better than Baby Mama (I was not a fan). This film is definitely entertaining!

1156342,A17BT73RVRQYSP,B00177YA6A,Peter Ingemi,"[2, 2]","Miss-conception is an odd little movie telling the tale of a woman who owns a construction company who shortly after breaking up with her man over his not wanting children finds that she only has a single egg left to have children with.Her maternal clock on overload she goes into overtime first trying to find her man (who went to Ireland to film a documentary) and then to try to find a man, ANY man to be the right father/contributor.As you might guess it leads to a comedy of errors and a bit of discovery for both her, her friend and her man Zack who owns the most poignant of the film in an encounter with a young nun in an Irish convent.I don't want to give away too much of the plot, bits and pieces of it are predictable but the movie does have its moments.
