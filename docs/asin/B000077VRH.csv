724750,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B000077VRH,Acute Observer,"[0, 8]","This film tells a story about LaSalle Parish in Louisiana (and by extension the rest of America). Sheriff Darryl is shown handling the rigors of his job. Oddly, he carries no pistol - a symbol of lacking something? A truck overturns on a curve, and spills its load of shoes. The poor people show up to carry off their free shoes, recalling that scene in Charles Dickens ""Tale of Two Cities"". Then a dead body is found, and this scandal should be censored, says the political boss and judge. Sheriff Darryl is visited by an exotic dancer who reports her husband is missing (after dancing at a private club). The rest of the film tells how the murder was solved.The language and contents of this film would have been banned prior to the 1990s. While ""realistic"" about the lost souls it portrays, it seems to have no redeeming social values. Yes, it gives a view to politics and personalities not usually seen in films, and which can educate the viewers. The film does not mention the corporations (like Big Oil) that dominated the politics of Louisiana, and other states. We see how the Twin-Party System meets at the top to accomplish its missions. Like in a small county, the heads of the opposing parties meet to divide the spoils. In this film the Governor loses an election. Was he too clean? So a new Administration takes office, and life goes on unchanged. There are some winners and loser, but that's the way the ball bounces. Blaming a small businessman who has a claim against the county seems too cynical.",2,Case Study of County Politics,1145318400,"04 18, 2006",2006,1514,"['film', 'story', 'LaSalle', 'Parish', 'Louisiana', 'extension', 'rest', 'America', 'Sheriff', 'Darryl', 'shown', 'handling', 'rigors', 'job', 'Oddly', 'pistol', 'symbol', 'lacking', 'something', 'truck', 'curve', 'load', 'shoes', 'poor', 'people', 'show', 'up', 'carry', 'off', 'free', 'shoes', 'recalling', 'scene', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'Tale', 'Two', 'Cities', 'Then', 'dead', 'body', 'found', 'scandal', 'should', 'be', 'censored', 'political', 'boss', 'judge', 'Sheriff', 'Darryl', 'visited', 'exotic', 'dancer', 'who', 'husband', 'missing', 'dancing', 'private', 'club', 'rest', 'film', 'how', 'murder', 'was', 'solved.The', 'language', 'contents', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'banned', 'prior', '1990s', 'realistic', 'lost', 'souls', 'have', 'redeeming', 'social', 'values', 'Yes', 'view', 'politics', 'personalities', 'not', 'usually', 'seen', 'films', 'can', 'educate', 'viewers', 'film', 'not', 'mention', 'corporations', 'Big', 'Oil', 'dominated', 'politics', 'Louisiana', 'other', 'states', 'see', 'how', 'Twin-Party', 'System', 'top', 'accomplish', 'missions', 'small', 'county', 'heads', 'opposing', 'parties', 'meet', 'divide', 'spoils', 'film', 'Governor', 'election', 'too', 'clean', 'So', 'new', 'Administration', 'office', 'life', 'unchanged', 'are', 'winners', 'loser', 'way', 'ball', 'bounces', 'Blaming', 'small', 'businessman', 'who', 'claim', 'county', 'too', 'cynical']",N/A

724755,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B000077VRH,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 2]","THE BADGE (2002) is something I'm not really sure I can review with a clear head. It was insulting and condescending, it treated a real problem in our society with all the dark humor it could (in other words, STUPIDLY), and ultimately because of its rotten director, it made mincemeat of a story that could have become a cult hit.Billy Bob Thornton (big red flag, especially because he was fresh off 2001's Oscar winnerMonster's Ball) plays Darl, the sheriff of a small Louisiana parish. The mysterious shooting death of a transsexual and the subsequent arrival of her wife to identify the body will unfurl a sordid tale. Political duplicity and every kind of cold, dirty human facet will be revealed.Though I will spoil nothing, I can certainly criticize a few things here:1. Billy Bob Thornton may be the best thing in this film. Patricia Arquette could never act her way out of a paper sack and I wish someone would tell her before it is too late. (Oops!)2. This thing needed to stop being a crap attempt at comedy the moment the death occurred. However, the entire cast continued wisecrackin', a-hootin' and a-hollerin'. It was quite the sad stereotypical cast, vastly sub-par.3. Am I the only human being besides transgendered/transsexual people getting tired of the nasty, negative portrayals in film? Is this community to remain 2nd-class forever?!4. This film - well, what was it? A parable about how we see the whole gay community as subhuman and unworthy? Was it about redemption, or simply the rotten corruption of politics that is as old as the hills anyway? This kind of movie is always the director's fault, a bad delivery system and no clear disciplinary line for the actors to follow.Yet there is a powerful light in all this, and I admit this paragraph here is years later than my original review which is all still as it was except for this: Billy Bob Thornton is a genius. What I have realized, especially after I saw his excellentJayne Mansfield's Car [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.4 Import - Australia], is Thornton does a brilliant job of turning a character's table, and spinning the audience's heads. In this film, I think Thornton was trying to defend the gay community. To see him is to see yourself, your brother, your uncle.Everyone's the same and deserves that acknowledgement. That is his magic, and I'd like to see a lot more of it. And his acting is perhaps the finest you'll see today, even though he tends toward being typecast. His genius is he surprises you by NOT being typecast after all.Let me try to conclude with a positive light: the film does illustrate the cold, hard world we have become. It illustrates the terrible police system as it stands now, and it also points up every form of corruption. To its credit, it attempts to show us the good of innocence - but that fails.

That being said...The Badge is a movie about small-town Louisiana politics, about family struggles, about coming to terms with suicidal mothers and homosexual brothers, and about the life-long struggle for justice in crimes against strippers and transsexuals.  The plot focuses on the murders of a New Orleans transsexual within the conservative LaSalle parish.  The reigning politicos of the parish don't want the alcoholic, local-boy sheriff (played by Billy Bob Thornton) to investigate the matter _too_ seriously and draw too much negative attention to the parish.  Sheriff Billy Bob is willing to play along with the game until his party tries to run him off the ticket for the next election.The action is truly about Billy Bob's sheriff character finding his own true self among the corrupt local and state politicians.  He manages both to find himself and to serve justice to the underground sex community (which serves the state politicians in a no-questions-asked deal).The filmmakers perfectly portray the atmosphere of lose parishes in Louisiana.

I was drawn to it by the star presence of Billy Bob Thornton, Sela Ward and Patricia Arquette. They don't disappoint. It was nice to see them in an independent little potboiler involving murder and politics in steamy Louisiana.Billy Bob is a small town sheriff whose &quot;good old boy&quot; handling of a truck accident uncovers something more unpleasant - the murder of a transsexual dancer. It turns out the dancer was present at a party that could implicate the Democrat governor and upset the town rich guy's plans to build a casino. Billy Bob's position as sheriff becomes inceasingly precarious as he changes his mind about a murder investigation he initially didn't want to put much effort into.There are a lot of twists and turns as the sherrif moves from self-preservation to seeking true justice. There is even some humor, not all of it intentional. One scene where I laughed out loud is when Arquette's character tells Thornton's sheriff that she and the dead she-male were married. That was even before the weirdness of the situation registers on Thornton's face.William Devane delivers a satisfying performance as the rich guy manipulating local politics. Sela Ward is good in a small if predictable role as Thornton's ex-wife, now the assistant DA.

Though the town isn't that much likeable on first sight (sure it's pretty, but its leaders are good-ole boy types, and the rest of the population run the gamut of amoral or extremist fundamentalist) but Hardwick seems to stand-out.  Incompetent, and on the verge of getting tossed out of office, Hardwick finds himself the only person capable of cracking a beguiling case of murder.  When the victim is found not to be a beautiful woman but a shockingly deceptive trans-sexual, the case becomes known as ""the freak"" and is quickly filed away with little expectation that anyone will bother to solve it.  Unfortunately for everybody, the murder occurs during election season - when everybody from the Governor to Darl will be campaigning for their political lives.  Because elections tend to bring out the hidden trash of the past term, Darl finds himself facing attack from different quarters - for stealing shoes from a truck involved in a vehicular accident, for having an affair with the wife of one of his deputies, for an outburst at the Governor.  When Darl finds himself in danger of losing the local party's endorsement for Sheriff, he becomes driven to solve ""The Freak"".  Instead he's ""set up"" on statutory rape charges (Darl's wanton ways make him an easy mark) and loses his job.  Obsessed with the idea that solving ""The Freak"" will restore his job, Darl pursues leads that will take him to New Orleans, to the victim's ""wife"" (Patty Arquette) and the gay brother Darl ran out of Lasalle many years ago.This was a good flick, but despite the talent it never goes further than being a TV movie, something for Lifetime.  Though ""The Badge"" is a mystery, Darl's story soon takes over the main focus of the flick - Darl's shady connections, his crazy father (a former sheriff who drove Darl's mother to suicide) his tenuous relationship with his deputies, the judges (the chief being a shady character played by William Devane), his politically connected ex (Sela Ward) and just about everybody else.  By then, the mystery only has a secondary role (to save Darl's career), and anyway, you'll be able to solve it by then.  Still, Darl's a character you can't quite stay away from, and Thornton brings out some pathos in a guy who inflicts suffering on others, but no more than on himself.",3,TV movie that doesn't match the leads,1085097600,"05 21, 2004",2004,2402,"['Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'Darl', 'Hardwick', 'morally', 'bankrupt', 'sheriff', 'small', 'Louisiana', 'town', 'Lassale', 'town', ""n't"", 'that', 'much', 'likeable', 'first', 'sight', 'sure', 'pretty', 'leaders', 'are', 'good-ole', 'boy', 'types', 'rest', 'population', 'run', 'gamut', 'amoral', 'extremist', 'fundamentalist', 'Hardwick', 'stand-out', 'Incompetent', 'verge', 'getting', 'tossed', 'office', 'Hardwick', 'only', 'person', 'capable', 'cracking', 'beguiling', 'case', 'murder', 'When', 'victim', 'found', 'not', 'be', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'shockingly', 'deceptive', 'trans-sexual', 'case', 'known', 'freak', 'quickly', 'filed', 'away', 'little', 'expectation', 'anyone', 'will', 'bother', 'solve', 'Unfortunately', 'everybody', 'murder', 'election', 'season', 'when', 'everybody', 'Governor', 'Darl', 'will', 'be', 'campaigning', 'political', 'lives', 'elections', 'tend', 'bring', 'out', 'hidden', 'trash', 'past', 'term', 'Darl', 'facing', 'attack', 'different', 'quarters', 'stealing', 'shoes', 'truck', 'involved', 'vehicular', 'accident', 'having', 'affair', 'wife', 'one', 'deputies', 'outburst', 'Governor', 'When', 'Darl', 'danger', 'losing', 'local', 'party', 'endorsement', 'Sheriff', 'driven', 'solve', 'Freak', 'Instead', 'set', 'up', 'statutory', 'rape', 'charges', 'Darl', 'wanton', 'ways', 'make', 'easy', 'mark', 'job', 'Obsessed', 'idea', 'solving', 'Freak', 'will', 'restore', 'job', 'Darl', 'will', 'take', 'New', 'Orleans', 'victim', 'wife', 'Patty', 'Arquette', 'gay', 'brother', 'Darl', 'ran', 'Lasalle', 'many', 'years', 'ago.This', 'was', 'good', 'flick', 'talent', 'never', 'further', 'being', 'TV', 'movie', 'something', 'Lifetime', 'Badge', 'mystery', 'Darl', 'story', 'soon', 'main', 'focus', 'flick', 'Darl', 'shady', 'connections', 'crazy', 'father', 'former', 'sheriff', 'who', 'drove', 'Darl', 'mother', 'suicide', 'tenuous', 'relationship', 'deputies', 'judges', 'chief', 'being', 'shady', 'character', 'played', 'William', 'Devane', 'politically', 'connected', 'ex', 'Sela', 'Ward', 'just', 'everybody', 'else', 'then', 'mystery', 'only', 'secondary', 'role', 'save', 'Darl', 'career', 'anyway', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'solve', 'then', 'Still', 'Darl', 'character', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'stay', 'away', 'Thornton', 'out', 'pathos', 'guy', 'who', 'suffering', 'others', 'more']",N/A
724765,ANEDXRFDZDL18,B000077VRH,Serene Night,"[3, 8]","I had mixed feelings about this movie. Mostly, because I found the main character, prejudiced sheriff  Darl Hardwick very difficult to like.  Not only is Darl a rigid homophobe, he also is also a racist and good-old-boy crooked cop... Feh. And this is the good guy?When a young transsexual is murdered, Darl is pressured not to investigate by the 'good old boys' of the local Government. Darl agrees, until he discovers the Mayor intends to oust him from his position in favor of an African-American sheriff. Only when he feels he might lose his job, does Darl become interested in investigating the murder.This was a hard-edged, and difficult film to view. Darl was an unsympathetic character, whose problematic traits outnumber the few good characteristics he might have.  Darl seems to want people to like him, and for things to go his way, but he doesn't want to actually work for it. In the end, I never feel like Darl changed because he wanted to. It was only because he wanted revenge. I was unsatisfied with this element of character development. Also, the 'mystery' was very transparent. I was able to spot the murderer very early on. Overall, a passible murder mystery, with elements of ""Crying Game"" added for shock value.",3,Difficult for this Californian to Empathize with......,1044835200,"02 10, 2003",2003,1233,"['had', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'movie', 'Mostly', 'found', 'main', 'character', 'prejudiced', 'sheriff', 'Darl', 'Hardwick', 'very', 'difficult', 'like', 'Not', 'only', 'Darl', 'rigid', 'homophobe', 'also', 'also', 'racist', 'good-old-boy', 'crooked', 'cop', 'Feh', 'good', 'guy', 'When', 'young', 'transsexual', 'murdered', 'Darl', 'pressured', 'not', 'investigate', ""'good"", 'old', 'boys', 'local', 'Government', 'Darl', 'Mayor', 'oust', 'position', 'favor', 'African-American', 'sheriff', 'Only', 'when', 'might', 'lose', 'job', 'Darl', 'become', 'interested', 'investigating', 'murder.This', 'was', 'hard-edged', 'difficult', 'film', 'view', 'Darl', 'was', 'unsympathetic', 'character', 'problematic', 'traits', 'outnumber', 'few', 'good', 'characteristics', 'might', 'have', 'Darl', 'want', 'people', 'like', 'things', 'go', 'way', ""n't"", 'want', 'actually', 'work', 'end', 'never', 'feel', 'Darl', 'changed', 'wanted', 'was', 'only', 'wanted', 'revenge', 'was', 'unsatisfied', 'element', 'character', 'development', 'Also', ""'mystery"", 'was', 'very', 'transparent', 'was', 'able', 'spot', 'murderer', 'very', 'early', 'Overall', 'passible', 'murder', 'mystery', 'elements', 'Crying', 'Game', 'added', 'shock', 'value']",N/A
