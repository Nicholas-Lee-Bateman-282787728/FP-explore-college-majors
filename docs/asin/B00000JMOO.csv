506570,A2EOFYRFB292KS,B00000JMOO,"Alberto M. Barral ""NY LuxViewer""","[0, 1]","This movie is all about Gloria. One certainly understands that phrase ""we had faces then"" implying we didn't need talking from  ""Sunset Boulevard"" much, much better after seeing this production.From the very start Gloria as Lady Mary Lasenby is in a palatial home and wearing exceedingly elaborate gowns, even to go from her bed to her bath, and I mean trailing yards of fabric. She is a spoiled brat that complains that the toast is soggy in her breakfast to her handsome butler (Thomas Meighan) who is salivating for her and to her maid  that the bath is not exactly the 90 degrees she expects. Eventhough her bath routine could have rivaled Cleopatra's, including the sunken pool and the shower with rose-perfumed water, one suspects that something is wrong with little poor rich girl and she is not totally happy.At one point she is counseling a friend-aristocrat Lady Eileen Duncraigie (Rhy Darby)not to marry her chauffeur (Henry Woodward)  who is a handsome hunk of a man who seems to really care for her. We get a glimpse of him helping her out of the car and I totally understood their relationship: Anyone that does as much touching, holding, supporting and clutching in such a brief period of time is bound to be a great lover and it helps that he looks like a model wearing a uniform that seems to emphasize all his good points.Gloria however counsels her against the match on principle, and as part of her own prejudiced, limited vision of life.She also spends a considerable amount of time searching for the second volume of a book of poems by a third rate writer, which has actually caught the fancy of her butler also. He has been reading the poems to a fellow servant in the library, a pretty maid (Lila Lee) that is very attracted to him and can not help but caress his shoe while he reads the line ""I was a King in Babylon and you were a Christian slave"" with a very sensuous persistance that would suggest a foot/shoe fetish passion was at work.The statement of the poem itself is an idiocy as there were never any Christians in Babylon, much less enslaved ones. The reason being that Babylon was at the time of Christ already largely abandoned as a city (from about 141 bc onwards) for over a century. The movie however does have a Babylonian scene that reenacts this poem in the most extravagant fashion, it happens much later when all the characters are stranded in an island after their yacht is shipwrecked in a deserted island, but it deserves coverage in detail.The shipwreck scene is quite dramatic and very suggestive of a mini-Titanic, piano included. Needless to say all the characters survive and get to a deserted island, some like her father (Robert Cain) atop a chicken box,  in rather comical ways, and soon find out that there are not only wild goats and abundant clams and lobsters, but also leopards. The Butler at this point becomes the leader of the pack and turns engineer-handy man: he buids a fire, cooks the food,  builds a hut, soon expanded into residential proportions and decorated with the latest 'native' style. As they all start living a Robinson Crusoe lifestyle, one can not help but think of this set up as an ancestor of the Gilligan's Island TV series.Gloria also changes from her art nouveau gown to a huntress look that could have  been thought up by Chanel and that applies to a lesser degree to the rest of the cast, she has a primitive-fabric suit with a hat that supports two pheasant feathers ""a la savage"" and she learns to hunt with arrows from her butler, now become king of the heap who is similarly attired but with the obligatory leopard skin hunting cape.It is precisely at this archery lesson that we see their feelings for each other are growing, (reminiscent of a similar deserted island story romance done  in ""Swept Away"" which has two versions, (1975) and (2002)  and soon after we have the dream sequence into Babylon when they mention the poem again.This is a most elaborate scene that most have sent the budget of the movie through the roof; There is a palatial hall in the Hollywood Babylonian style with the wrong sculptural motifs but otherwise quiet believable, and with a heavy dose of Art Deco stylization that would make for an impressive lobby in Radio City. The butler sits on the throne, a large cocktail-shaker crown on his head, metalized tunic and high sandals complete the outfil, worn with a brooding expression of tyrannical granderur that never lifts through the entire scene. Behind him there is a guard that surely had a career in dancing, standing in a Deco-Babylonian uniform and to his right a favorite of his harem decked out in an exquisite follies girl costume, complete with a crown that would be phenomenal in a Brazillian carnival but would be soon eclipsed by Gloria's appearance as the rebellious beauty, all done in a white peacock theme that includes the stuffed bird in her head, complete with tail fanning out as a tiara. It takes real glamour not to make this get up completely farcical, and Gloria not only makes it, she looks beautiful in that crazy thing, amazingly she can walk in it too, and goes to meet her fate in the lion's den with a doomed heroine's aplomb.A wedding scene soon develops for Gloria and her butler that is interrupted by the unexpected arrival of a ship that finally rescues them all and brings them back to England where they all go back to their former lives without interruption, as if the Babylonian dream had also extended into their past and made it all a complete fantasy.The acting throughout is superb, and very nuanced, it makes the story, which can be slow at times, very enjoyable. The Babylonian sequence is an unexpected bonus and like seeing another film altogether. I find DeMille's treatment of the theme extremely conservative, if not altogether retrograde. 1919 when this movie was released, was a time of huge social change throughout a world that had just toppled all the European empires at the end of the First World war, and DeMille's commentary is that going back to the old is the best way. I think it remarkable that he chooses that topic and that way of telling the story at that particular time period. We see here an artificiality and make-believe that is the root of Hollywood distortion of socio-historical phenomenon that is going to be an extremely strong tendency in the future: The desire to create a reality that copies the details of real life, but achieves a 'fantastical reality"" far from the actual, and also dramatically divorced from  the tendencies that were developing in European Contemporary film, such as German Expressionism. Even before the advent of drugs DeMille had detected the strong escapist tendencies in the culture and had decided to ""give them more of what they want"".",3,Gloria Swanson in Hollywood

Male and Female is a silent version of The Admirable Crichton.  The players were all excellent as some change from being the wealthy emloyees to being dependent on the servants, especially Thomas Meighan who is the butler.  The family goes out on a yacht and are shipwrecked which requires the role reversal and Thomas takes over.  He is a very likeable person and I can readily understand his popularity in his day. He has an air of authority. Gloria Swanson is in one of her first movies as the female lead.  Although they are all rescued eventually and revert to their original positions in the household, the film does end on a happy note.  The acting is good and restrained with the actors' faces being most expressive - who needs to hear dialogue?

Barrie play called ""The Admirable Crichton."" (Barrie is best known as creator of ""Peter Pan."")In this story, the privileged class gets a comeuppance. William Crichton (Meighan), a capable and educated man, is butler to a noble British clan headed by Lord Loam (Roberts). Crichton is secretly in love with the Lord's daughter, Mary (Swanson) and the scullery maid Tweeny (Lee) is in love with him. The family and servants are shipwrecked during a South Seas excursion, and Crichton, by virtue of his many survival skills, becomes leader and rule setter.

J Jensen,"[12, 13]","I had read some of the reviews on this film, and although they do a good job of revealing the basic plot synopsis, they don't fully do it justice.first of all, when the DVD cover says ""lavishly staged"", that was really an understatement. sure, i knew about the legendary ""King of Babylon"" scene and was expecting a lavish DeMille set for that segment, but this statement also applies to the rest of the film as well. for example, i was shocked by the scene of the ship crashing and sinking, with both an external ship torn up on the rocks, as well as amazing internal shots of the rock breaching the hull and Gloria trapped in the flooding water below deck.the scenes on the island were always beautiful, although one thing that seems to be absent from other reviews is the point of ridiculousness that the castoways nearly descend to. to be frank, i wasn't expecting a depiction of shipwreck that so closely resembeled Gilligan's Island, but when you look at it, there are similarities between the cast: the millionaire, the movie star (Gloria Swanson), the girl next door, even a cowardly comic relief Gilliganesque character, not to mention the admirable Chrichton, whose outlandish inventions put him in the position of the professor. to modern audiences, it is a little absurd to see the grass hut mansion complete with modern furniture and other luxuries, but it isn't any less entertaining.although the basic premise of the movie is well known, it has probably never been conveyed as well as it was in this film (reference the similar theme in either version of Swept Away). mostly, that credit goes to amazing direction and a stunning cast. one can easily see why Gloria Swanson was one of the world's biggest sensations, because she can evoke sympathy from the audience for even the most undesirable characters like Lady Mary. the cast deserves a standing ovation for their performance, which otherwise could have been just a silly melodrama. instead, we actually do care about the unjust caste system and how it affects the lovers on both sides of the spectrum.",5,Way more than expected,1091750400,"08 6, 2004",2004,2071,"['had', 'read', 'reviews', 'film', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'revealing', 'basic', 'plot', 'synopsis', 'do', ""n't"", 'fully', 'do', 'justice.first', 'when', 'DVD', 'cover', 'lavishly', 'staged', 'was', 'really', 'understatement', 'sure', 'i', 'knew', 'legendary', 'King', 'Babylon', 'scene', 'was', 'expecting', 'lavish', 'DeMille', 'set', 'segment', 'statement', 'also', 'rest', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'example', 'i', 'was', 'shocked', 'scene', 'ship', 'crashing', 'sinking', 'external', 'ship', 'torn', 'up', 'rocks', 'as', 'well', 'amazing', 'internal', 'shots', 'rock', 'breaching', 'hull', 'Gloria', 'trapped', 'flooding', 'water', 'deck.the', 'scenes', 'island', 'were', 'always', 'beautiful', 'one', 'thing', 'be', 'absent', 'other', 'reviews', 'point', 'ridiculousness', 'castoways', 'nearly', 'descend', 'be', 'frank', 'i', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'depiction', 'shipwreck', 'so', 'closely', 'resembeled', 'Gilligan', 'Island', 'when', 'look', 'are', 'similarities', 'cast', 'millionaire', 'movie', 'star', 'Gloria', 'Swanson', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'even', 'cowardly', 'comic', 'relief', 'Gilliganesque', 'character', 'not', 'mention', 'admirable', 'Chrichton', 'outlandish', 'inventions', 'put', 'position', 'professor', 'modern', 'audiences', 'little', 'absurd', 'see', 'grass', 'hut', 'mansion', 'complete', 'modern', 'furniture', 'other', 'luxuries', ""n't"", 'less', 'basic', 'premise', 'movie', 'well', 'known', 'probably', 'never', 'been', 'conveyed', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'film', 'reference', 'similar', 'theme', 'version', 'Swept', 'Away', 'mostly', 'credit', 'amazing', 'direction', 'stunning', 'cast', 'one', 'can', 'easily', 'see', 'why', 'Gloria', 'Swanson', 'was', 'one', 'world', 'biggest', 'sensations', 'can', 'evoke', 'sympathy', 'audience', 'even', 'most', 'undesirable', 'characters', 'Lady', 'Mary', 'cast', 'standing', 'ovation', 'performance', 'otherwise', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'silly', 'melodrama', 'instead', 'actually', 'do', 'care', 'unjust', 'caste', 'system', 'how', 'lovers', 'sides', 'spectrum']",Male and Female

He is often lambasted and compared unfavourably with other silent directors, but De Mille outlasted most of them, not least because he was a great storyteller. The story of Male and Female, adapted from J.M. Barrie's The Admirable Crichton, is amusing and an interesting comment on class difference. The performances are naturalistic and subtle showing silent acting at its best. This film offers an especially welcome opportunity to see a very young Gloria Swanson. Her famous bath scene is much less modest than one would expect in a post production-code film, though its hardly shocking by today's standards. Her descent into a Babylonian lion's den is quite startling and not at all gratuitous (as the DVD box would have it) for the film has a number of plot points which build up to this 'dream' sequence. This DVD is really top notch, for the print is first class with very little deterioration. It is well tinted, with appropriate colours and greys.

506576,AV3DZX3NU7NWU,B00000JMOO,"Prometheus ""diosprometheus""","[16, 37]","A previous reviewer raised an interesting question. He asked &quot;It is really hard to see why De Mille has such a relatively poor reputation, when one sees a film like Male and Female.&quot;This is not really a hard question to answer, but one must understand De Mille and the nature of his politics. De Mille has a poor reputation for many of the same reasons that Elia Kazan was treated so poorly at the Oscars a few years ago by so many in Hollywood and the same reasons why Robert Taylor's name was removed from a building on the old MGM lot.De Mille was anti-unionist, anti-communist, conservative, Republican; profoundly religious the other things that tend to destroy one's reputation in Hollywood.  In the 1940's De Mille was forced out of the host position of Lux Radio Theatre because he refused to join the union of AFRA, (now Aftra).What is often forgotten about De Mille is that he was, along with Samuel Goldfish, and Jesse L. Lasky, one of the founders of Paramount and in the early days of that studio, he was the creative force. He not only directed and produced many of the company's films, but also was in control of the company's entire output, writing scripts and directing sequences in films assigned to other directors. De Mille is often credited as the first man to film (the 1914 Squaw Man) in Hollywood. He did more than any other man to make Hollywood the greatest film center of the World. He handled every genre in film and even invented some that never existed before.In the mid 20's, De Mille sold his shares in Paramount and joined MGM briefly where he made some of his worst films such as the eccentric Madame Satan.De Mille doesn't deserve the poor reputation that he has. He was a cut above most of his competitors in narrative skills, pacing of action, in gauging public tastes and anticipating the changing moods of the nation. He developed some of Hollywood's brightest and most famous stars. He was a master storyteller and his films almost always entertained. But in Hollywood, as the truely blacklisted Kazan, Adolph Menjou and William Dmytryk found, your reputation is often judged on your politics and not by your product.",3,Why De Mille has a poor reputation?,984960000,"03 19, 2001",2001,2167,"['previous', 'reviewer', 'raised', 'interesting', 'question', 'asked', 'quot', 'really', 'hard', 'see', 'why', 'De', 'Mille', 'relatively', 'poor', 'reputation', 'when', 'one', 'film', 'Male', 'Female.', 'quot', 'not', 'really', 'hard', 'question', 'answer', 'one', 'must', 'understand', 'De', 'Mille', 'nature', 'politics', 'De', 'Mille', 'poor', 'reputation', 'many', 'same', 'reasons', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'was', 'treated', 'so', 'poorly', 'Oscars', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'so', 'many', 'Hollywood', 'same', 'reasons', 'why', 'Robert', 'Taylor', 'name', 'was', 'removed', 'building', 'old', 'MGM', 'lot.De', 'Mille', 'was', 'anti-unionist', 'anti-communist', 'conservative', 'Republican', 'profoundly', 'religious', 'other', 'things', 'tend', 'destroy', 'one', 'reputation', 'Hollywood', '1940', 'De', 'Mille', 'was', 'forced', 'host', 'position', 'Lux', 'Radio', 'Theatre', 'refused', 'join', 'union', 'AFRA', 'now', 'Aftra', '.What', 'often', 'forgotten', 'De', 'Mille', 'was', 'Samuel', 'Goldfish', 'Jesse', 'L.', 'Lasky', 'one', 'founders', 'Paramount', 'early', 'days', 'studio', 'was', 'creative', 'force', 'not', 'only', 'directed', 'produced', 'many', 'company', 'films', 'also', 'was', 'control', 'company', 'entire', 'output', 'writing', 'scripts', 'directing', 'sequences', 'films', 'assigned', 'other', 'directors', 'De', 'Mille', 'often', 'credited', 'first', 'man', 'film', '1914', 'Squaw', 'Man', 'Hollywood', 'did', 'more', 'other', 'man', 'make', 'Hollywood', 'greatest', 'film', 'center', 'World', 'handled', 'genre', 'film', 'even', 'invented', 'never', 'existed', 'mid', '20', 'De', 'Mille', 'sold', 'shares', 'Paramount', 'joined', 'MGM', 'briefly', 'where', 'made', 'worst', 'films', 'such', 'eccentric', 'Madame', 'Satan.De', 'Mille', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'poor', 'reputation', 'was', 'cut', 'most', 'competitors', 'narrative', 'skills', 'pacing', 'action', 'gauging', 'public', 'tastes', 'anticipating', 'changing', 'moods', 'nation', 'developed', 'Hollywood', 'brightest', 'most', 'famous', 'stars', 'was', 'master', 'storyteller', 'films', 'almost', 'always', 'entertained', 'Hollywood', 'truely', 'blacklisted', 'Kazan', 'Adolph', 'Menjou', 'William', 'Dmytryk', 'found', 'reputation', 'often', 'judged', 'politics', 'not', 'product']",Male and Female

The one by Image Entertainment is way better than the one from Alpha Home Entertainment.  The main reason is that several reels are missing in the Alpha version, leaving an important part (the shipwreck and all but the last scenes of the island escapade) out of the movie.  The Image Entertainment also contains tinting, which I do not remember seeing in the Alpha version, and the accompaniment music is better on the Image one, being crafted for the movie (even though hearing synthesized horns is detracting), instead of just stringing together symphonic scores like Alpha did.  They worked, just not all that well at all.  Of course the difference in run times will tell you the story, 57 minutes versus 115 minutes.
