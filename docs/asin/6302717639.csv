328885,A23UB49EG29MVT,6302717639,Commenter77,"[1, 1]","I had to see Lana Turner with Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. or the other way around. It was a curiosity - superstar with very moderate actor. No doubt, Zimbalist has the GQ looks and a wonderful speaking voice, but very limited acting range.. He was at the peak of the popularity of ""77 Sunset Strip"" at this time. In that, he mainly had to be cool with a certain superior air. There were some lively characters about him to offset. Then, in the middle of his FBI series (sober, taciturn type there), he co-starred in ""Wait Until Dark"" with Audrey Hepburn. Same as here - just basically filled the suit. Saw he did some stage work early on and worked steadily through the decades, while others with his level of talent faded away. He was fortunate in his TV projects.But this is a typical melodrama, popular during this era, especially with Turner. Everyone was at some stage of pathetic. That would except the Thomas Mitchell character, who was a breath of fresh air. They could have called this ""All Fall Down and Can't Get Up.""  It really needed to go through several rinse cycles to clear out all the suds. The visuals were the stars:  stately homes, well appointed rooms, rich paneling, beautiful fall trees. One reviewer trying to make the best of it commented that at least these drab folks had colorful backdrops.There have been other films with the same deficits as this one that have managed to come across. Sometimes the higher caliber actors can pull it out, and there were some of those here. Unfortunately, it didn't happen.  Someone must have called for flat line, and they all adhered. The simultaneous reconciliations at the end were so low on the meter, they hardly registered. This one lacked a pulse from beginning to dead end.",2,Attractive Shell - Hollow Interior,1351123200,"10 25, 2012",2012,1738,"['had', 'see', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'Efrem', 'Zimbalist', 'Jr.', 'other', 'way', 'was', 'curiosity', 'superstar', 'very', 'moderate', 'actor', 'doubt', 'Zimbalist', 'GQ', 'wonderful', 'speaking', 'voice', 'very', 'limited', 'acting', 'range..', 'was', 'peak', 'popularity', '77', 'Sunset', 'Strip', 'time', 'mainly', 'had', 'be', 'cool', 'certain', 'superior', 'air', 'were', 'lively', 'characters', 'offset', 'Then', 'middle', 'FBI', 'series', 'sober', 'taciturn', 'type', 'there', 'co-starred', 'Wait', 'Dark', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'Same', 'here', 'just', 'basically', 'filled', 'suit', 'did', 'stage', 'work', 'early', 'worked', 'steadily', 'decades', 'others', 'level', 'talent', 'faded', 'away', 'was', 'fortunate', 'TV', 'projects.But', 'typical', 'melodrama', 'popular', 'era', 'especially', 'Turner', 'Everyone', 'was', 'stage', 'pathetic', 'would', 'except', 'Thomas', 'Mitchell', 'character', 'who', 'was', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'could', 'have', 'called', 'Fall', 'Down', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Get', 'Up', 'really', 'needed', 'go', 'several', 'rinse', 'cycles', 'clear', 'out', 'suds', 'visuals', 'were', 'stars', 'stately', 'homes', 'well', 'appointed', 'rooms', 'rich', 'paneling', 'beautiful', 'fall', 'trees', 'One', 'reviewer', 'trying', 'make', 'best', 'commented', 'least', 'drab', 'folks', 'had', 'colorful', 'backdrops.There', 'have', 'been', 'other', 'films', 'same', 'deficits', 'one', 'have', 'managed', 'come', 'Sometimes', 'higher', 'caliber', 'actors', 'can', 'pull', 'out', 'were', 'here', 'Unfortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'Someone', 'must', 'have', 'called', 'flat', 'line', 'adhered', 'simultaneous', 'reconciliations', 'end', 'were', 'so', 'low', 'meter', 'hardly', 'registered', 'one', 'lacked', 'pulse', 'beginning', 'dead', 'end']",By Love Possessed VHS

They live exactly as they are supposed to, as they were raised to live.

328890,A135WQ77OCZID7,6302717639,"Perry R. Johnson ""Perry R. Johnson""","[2, 3]","Filmed in 1961, ""By Love Possessed"" was a scandelous movie for people's morales but tame today. This movie is about a small community of new England lawyers and families who are involved with cheating, lying, and adultry. While the exciting ones play, the boring ones are in their elements of a June and Ward Beaver home. Lana Turner has star billing but this movie is more like a soap opera and shifts between different scenes with different characters. Future Miss Ellie of the t.v. show Dallas, Barbara Bel Geddes plays the same role as the wife of Efrem Zimbalist Jr. as she did as Miss Ellie on Dallas and surprisingly doesn't look much different. A very young George Hamilton plays the son of Zimbalist and Geddes and gets into a very bad legal charge, which can damaged his chances of becoming a lawyer. Susan Kohner, who was Lana Turner's agent's daughter, plays the niece of Bel Geddess and hopes to be the financee of George Hamilton. Susan looks very much like a young Natalie Wood but her acting is predictable and limited. Kohner had a much better part in ""Imitation of Life"" as the mixed white daughter of a black maid. Yvonne Craig ""Batgirl"" makes a very conviencing whore, who gets George Hamilton into trouble. Jason Robbards Jr, a fine actor, has a limited role as Lana Turner's impotent crippled husband. However, the one you can't wait to always see is the beautiful Lana Turner. At age 40, Lana looks better than she ever has. Lana furs and costumes were no short of luxury and she knew how to act. Movie had some unresolved endings but I buy this alone because of Lana Turner.

She's really old enough to be my mother but she was a very beautiful women and a very powerful actress.  I have all her films.  Granted in todays age she comes off a bit campy but these were great movies. What also impressed me about this movie was the music.  Back then orchestras were used unlike the canned background music of todays films which usually leave me empty.  The music of these older films had great theme music for each character.  This is a great movie to watch anytime.  Check out her other classics like &quot;Madamme X&quot; and &quot;Imatation of Life&quot; especially if you like a great tear jerker.

328892,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,6302717639,Simon Davis,"[17, 20]","Lana Turner will be perhaps always best remembered as one of Hollywood's most glamourous personalities during her hey day in the 1940's at MGM when she was known as the sweater girl and starred in such unforgettable films as ""The Postman Always Rings twice"".  However I personally find her just as interesting in her later efforts when she formed a highly successful collaboration with Producer Ross Hunter. Hunter was responsible for giving Lana Turner a fresh new screen persona and revived her career in a number of very successful high glamour melodramas such as ""Imitation of life"", ""Portrait in Black"" and Madame X"", which kept her in prominence in Hollywood for most of the 1960's. ""By Love Possessed"", while a lesser effort than the above mentioned films was made straight after her first two Ross Hunter outings and is definately out of the same mould piling on the glamour and dramatic situations in a beautiful production which perhaps only lacks the masterful hand of Ross Hunter to have made it a truly memorable entry in the series of glossy melodramas that Lana Turner specialised in through the early sixties.Based on the 1957 Pulitizer Prize winning novel of the same name by James Gould Cozzen, ""By Love Possessed"", set in a properous New England town tells the stories of the intermingled lives of three upright blue blooded families, the Penroses, the Winners and the Tuttles. All three families are from the gilded world of ""old money"", and run the local law firm which is by tradition passed down to each succeeding generation of males when they graduate from Harvard. The seemingly perfectly ordered lives of this priviledged group however betrays many problems that are glossed over for the sake of public appearances and their standing in th elocal community. Recent Harvard graduate Warren Winner (George Hamilton), is continually in direct conflict with his repressed father Arthur (Efrem Zimbalist Jr.) who himself is locked in a marriage with the daughter (Barbara Bel Geddes),of senior partner Noah Tuttle (Thomas Mitchell) which was basically expected of him despite the lack of any real love between the pair. Meanwhile alcoholic and love deprived Marjorie Penrose (Lana Turner) is on the point of divorcing her unloving semi invalid husband Julius Penrose (Jason Robards), and indulges in a brief afair with former love Arthur as a way of filling th eempty void in her affluent but empty life. While Warren is pursued by the lonely Helen Detweiler(Susan Kohner), who is a ward of his grandfather and who he is expected to eventually marry, he instead finds his pleasure in the arms of less lofty company in particular those of waitress Veronica Kovacs (Yvonne Craig), who when rejected by Warren lays charges of rape against him. In the rapidly crumbling order of things in their neat lives an avalanche of long hidden emotions and family conflict surfaces and while some of it results in tragedy such as the suicide of Helen, other elements work towards a new beginning with a new honesty among many of the members of these formrly upright and seemingly perfect blue blooded clans. Marjorie puts off her plans to leave the cold Julius and both commit to work towards trying to save their marriage while Arthur after many years of not being able to reveal his feelings for his son joins together with him and with the support of his wife Clarissa prepares to tackle the charges brought against Warren in court.""By Love possessed"", had the perfect literary source and it was inevitable that it would make it to the screen with a glamourous figure like Lana Turner taking the lead. Despite being a Pulitizer Prize winner the story of course is pure soap but of th emost enjoyable kind. Although this was not a Ross Hunter production it has all the hallmarks of his efforts from around this time with beautiful colour photography, lavish sets and many stunning outfits for its glamourously photographed leading lady. Strangely ""By Love Possessed"", didn't provide Lana Turner with as lengthy or meaty role as such vehicles as ""Imitation of Life"". Much of the action does take place at the law firm among its partners with Lana Turner off screen however she does make the most of her scenes and she displays an easy chemistry with Efrem Zimbalist Jr. and especially George Hamilton who would join her again at th eend of the 1960's decade in the infamous ""Survivors"" television series. Turner is still very much the star here however despite her smaller screen time and she was that unique commodity in the early 1960's where she was a by then mature actress who was still being showcased in glossy goodlooking vehicles without having to yet go down the ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"", path way. The supporting cast of ""By Love Possessed is uniformly fine and a wonderful illustration of the great talent that was still available for character parts just as Hollywood's studio system was ending. Jason Robards, Efrem Zimbalist Jr. (who was soon to find everlasting fame as part of the hit television series ""The F.B.I""), Barbara Bel Geddes (long before stardom on ""Dallas"",) and veteran performer Thomas Mitchell in his second last film appearance all add their considerable acting credentials to the proceedings and make this soapish story more creditable than it probably deserves to be. The ""younger "", generation are represented by George Hamilton well into his bland leading man stage and long before he revealed his fine comic talents in films such as ""Love at First Bite"", and by an interesting performance by Susan Kohner as the tragic Helen. Kohner had previously worked to great effect with Lana Turner in ""Imitation of Life"" in 1959 but sadly here has few scenes with her. The rich New England atmosphere is a great asset to this story with much of the story taking place in the fall/Autumn to further emphasize the rich outer appearance of much of the lives of these intermingled families. John Sturges still best remembered for his sterling direction on ""The Magnificent Seven"", here steers a very different acting ship but manages to take a fairly unexciting story and give it the pace and emphasis to overcome some of its weaknesses.Vintage soap perhaps but ""By Love Possessed"",overcomes many of its weaknesses in story and content with its fine cast of seasoned professionals and by a beautifully mounted  presentation the like of which became a real rarity as the next decade wore on and harsh realism in story telling took over. Certainly it isn't in the same caliber as some of Lana Turner's other similiar efforts from this time like ""Peyton Place, ""Imitation of Life"", or ""Madame X"", but it is a respectable effort in its own right and required viewing for those that enjoy well mounted, star filled romantic stories.

328893,AXHCIHVT92GYF,6302717639,The CinemaScope Cat,"[1, 1]","A small town attorney (Efrem Zimbalist Jr.) must deal with several important issues during approximately a 3 day period: his wife (Barbara Bel Geddes) who is unhappy in their marriage, his son (George Hamilton) who is arrested for raping the town tramp (Yvonne Craig), the failing mental faculties of his law partner (Thomas Mitchell) and engaging in an affair with his other law partner's (Jason Robards) wife (Lana Turner). A huge best seller and critically acclaimed upon its publication in 1957, no one reads BY LOVE POSSESSED today nor does (I stand to be corrected) James Gould Cozzens' reputation (he made the cover of Time magazine) enjoy the literary position he had in the 50s and 60s. You'd never know from the film that it was based on anything other than a trashy potboiler. To be fair, the film mutilates the book. Turner's adulterous wife, for example, is a minor character in the book but given prominence in the film. Hamilton's character, who is deceased in the book, is resurrected and combined with another character whose sister is rewritten as his girlfriend (Susan Kohner, in the film's best performance). What's lefty is a lush imitation of a melodrama that cries out for Douglas Sirk (Sirk's regular cinematographer, Russell Metty, is the film's DP) to come in and rescue it. Instead, it's directed by John Sturges whose best films (THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, THE GREAT ESCAPE, BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK) are testosterone fueled ""guy"" films that give no indication that he has a talent for glossy melodramas. Elmer Bernstein provides the ripe underscore. With Everett Sloane, Carroll O'Connor and Jean Willes.The Bounty DVD from Australia is a nice wide screen (about 1.78) non anamorphic transfer.",3,A mutilation of the critically acclaimed novel,1368748800,"05 17, 2013",2013,1715,"['small', 'town', 'attorney', 'Efrem', 'Zimbalist', 'Jr.', 'must', 'deal', 'several', 'important', 'issues', 'approximately', '3', 'day', 'period', 'wife', 'Barbara', 'Bel', 'Geddes', 'who', 'unhappy', 'marriage', 'son', 'George', 'Hamilton', 'who', 'arrested', 'raping', 'town', 'tramp', 'Yvonne', 'Craig', 'failing', 'mental', 'faculties', 'law', 'partner', 'Thomas', 'Mitchell', 'engaging', 'affair', 'other', 'law', 'partner', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'wife', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'huge', 'best', 'seller', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'publication', '1957', 'one', 'reads', 'BY', 'LOVE', 'POSSESSED', 'today', 'stand', 'be', 'corrected', 'James', 'Gould', 'Cozzens', 'reputation', 'made', 'cover', 'Time', 'magazine', 'literary', 'position', 'had', '50s', '60s', ""'d"", 'never', 'know', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'anything', 'other', 'trashy', 'potboiler', 'be', 'fair', 'film', 'book', 'Turner', 'adulterous', 'wife', 'example', 'minor', 'character', 'book', 'given', 'prominence', 'film', 'Hamilton', 'character', 'who', 'deceased', 'book', 'resurrected', 'combined', 'character', 'sister', 'rewritten', 'girlfriend', 'Susan', 'Kohner', 'film', 'best', 'performance', 'What', 'lefty', 'lush', 'imitation', 'melodrama', 'out', 'Douglas', 'Sirk', 'Sirk', 'regular', 'cinematographer', 'Russell', 'Metty', 'film', 'DP', 'come', 'rescue', 'Instead', 'directed', 'John', 'Sturges', 'best', 'films', 'MAGNIFICENT', 'SEVEN', 'THE', 'GREAT', 'ESCAPE', 'BAD', 'DAY', 'AT', 'BLACK', 'ROCK', 'are', 'testosterone', 'fueled', 'guy', 'films', 'give', 'indication', 'talent', 'glossy', 'melodramas', 'Elmer', 'Bernstein', 'ripe', 'underscore', 'Everett', 'Sloane', 'Carroll', ""O'Connor"", 'Jean', 'Willes.The', 'Bounty', 'DVD', 'Australia', 'nice', 'wide', 'screen', '1.78', 'non', 'anamorphic', 'transfer']",By Love Possessed VHS

Her characters are so pathetic, and tragic.. but the pathos and sensitivity she demonstrated in her performances will always be remembered.. not to mention, her true story in the headlines.. what a life.. she was a production in many ways... I have most of her movies ..this is another soap story..albeit not one that the critics liked but it was one that was based on a best seller, could have developed Marjorie's alcoholism  a little better but that was the 60's  ... the story takes place in New England a cast of dysfunctional people trying to get their needs met... (that is the social worker in me)... but what I purchased the movie for to be honest... was for the music score by Elmer Bernstein amidst the New England scenes was the theme from the movie..... E.B. has always been one of my favorite movie composers.. and he does not disappoint...the sound production  was not the best, the story was not the strongest, could have been longer in the character department ,corny acting at times.. but the cast was good none the less....scenery beautiful, and the music score romantic to the core.. Another movie starring Joanne woodward and Paul Newman, "" From the Terrace"" the score by you guessed it... Elmer Bernstein once again romantic to the core...great romantic movie music always enhances the story. The  acting was good as well...another 60's product.... these are classics that this younger generation has  no concept or appreciation of these classics... they have something to learn!",5,""" By Love Possessed"" shocking then, not so much now !",1340841600,"06 28, 2012",2012,1528,"['love', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'movies', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'pathetic', 'tragic..', 'pathos', 'sensitivity', 'demonstrated', 'performances', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'remembered..', 'not', 'mention', 'true', 'story', 'headlines..', 'what', 'life..', 'was', 'production', 'many', 'ways', 'have', 'most', 'movies', '..this', 'soap', 'story..albeit', 'not', 'one', 'critics', 'liked', 'was', 'one', 'was', 'based', 'best', 'seller', 'could', 'have', 'developed', 'Marjorie', 'alcoholism', 'little', 'better', 'was', '60', 'story', 'place', 'New', 'England', 'cast', 'dysfunctional', 'people', 'trying', 'get', 'needs', 'met', 'social', 'worker', 'what', 'purchased', 'movie', 'be', 'honest', 'was', 'music', 'score', 'Elmer', 'Bernstein', 'New', 'England', 'scenes', 'was', 'theme', 'movie', '..', 'E.B', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'movie', 'composers..', 'not', 'disappoint', 'sound', 'production', 'was', 'not', 'best', 'story', 'was', 'not', 'strongest', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'longer', 'character', 'department', 'corny', 'acting', 'times..', 'cast', 'was', 'good', 'none', 'less', '.scenery', 'beautiful', 'music', 'score', 'romantic', 'core..', 'movie', 'starring', 'Joanne', 'woodward', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'Terrace', 'score', 'guessed', 'Elmer', 'Bernstein', 'once', 'again', 'romantic', 'core', 'great', 'romantic', 'movie', 'music', 'always', 'story', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'as', 'well', '60', 'product', 'are', 'classics', 'younger', 'generation', 'concept', 'appreciation', 'classics', 'have', 'something', 'learn']",By Love Possessed VHS
