Although an earlier work from ""A Separation"" it is just as vivid and engrossing. The actors are well-cast and bring a lot of nuance to their performances. It feels so real. This movie's a gem of world cinema. Definitely a keeper!",5,Terrific slice-of-life movie,1370131200,"06 2, 2013",2013,343,"['Centred', 'events', 'single', 'day', 'riveting', 'movie', 'complex', 'web', 'human', 'relationships', 'earlier', 'work', 'Separation', 'just', 'vivid', 'engrossing', 'actors', 'are', 'well-cast', 'bring', 'lot', 'nuance', 'performances', 'so', 'real', 'movie', 'gem', 'world', 'cinema', 'Definitely', 'keeper']",Fireworks Wednesday
1140446,A2SLA0SXRQV8M0,B0013B34X0,Andres C. Salama,"[0, 0]","This film by Iranian director Asghar Farhadi (A Separation, About Elly) is well made, though in my opinion he has done better films. There are elements in this movie you see in other films of the director: heated marital discussions, secrets and lies coming to the light, cultural differences between the middle class and the working class. However, the end result is not as compelling as in other of his movies.The action transpires on a single day in Tehran during the celebration of the Iranian new year (a holiday where a lot of fireworks are thrown). The young Rouhi (played by the pretty and talented Taraneeh Alidosti, who was in About Elly), is a working class woman that will soon marry her boyfriend. She gets a temporary job cleaning a apartment in a middle class neighborhood. Upon arriving at the apartment she finds herself in the middle of a heated domestic dispute between Mojdeh and Morteza. Mojdeh (Heyde Tehrani) suspects that her husband Morteza is cheating on her with the next door neighbor Simin, a woman who set up a beauty salon there after her own marriage broke up. Over the course of the day, Rouhi, the fighting couple, their small son, the wife's sister and husband, and the beautician engage in a series of exchanges and confrontations, as the truth unfolds.Of course, the central conceit of the film, that the residents of the apartment complex would trust this cleaning lady they barely know so much they would confide to her all their problems, is absurd. At one point, Mojdeh even asks Rouhi to pick her young son at school (she has only known her for a few hours, and already trusts her to fetch her son, whom she has never met!)Not knowing much about Iranian culture, I was intrigued by the relationship between Rouhi and her boyfriend. I suppose Iran being a culturally conservative country their relationship before marriage is non sexual, yet they seem so close and loving, especially at the opening scenes of the movie. But the movie doesn&#8217;t dwell too much in this, a pity since you don&#8217;t see much about young love in Iranian movies.",3,Worth seeing but not perfect,1397692800,"04 17, 2014",2014,2086,"['film', 'Iranian', 'director', 'Asghar', 'Farhadi', 'Separation', 'About', 'Elly', 'well', 'made', 'opinion', 'done', 'better', 'films', 'are', 'elements', 'movie', 'see', 'other', 'films', 'director', 'heated', 'marital', 'discussions', 'secrets', 'coming', 'light', 'cultural', 'differences', 'middle', 'class', 'working', 'class', 'However', 'end', 'result', 'not', 'as', 'compelling', 'other', 'movies.The', 'action', 'transpires', 'single', 'day', 'Tehran', 'celebration', 'Iranian', 'new', 'year', 'holiday', 'where', 'lot', 'fireworks', 'are', 'thrown', 'young', 'Rouhi', 'played', 'pretty', 'talented', 'Taraneeh', 'Alidosti', 'who', 'was', 'About', 'Elly', 'working', 'class', 'woman', 'will', 'soon', 'marry', 'boyfriend', 'temporary', 'job', 'cleaning', 'apartment', 'middle', 'class', 'neighborhood', 'arriving', 'apartment', 'middle', 'heated', 'domestic', 'dispute', 'Mojdeh', 'Morteza', 'Mojdeh', 'Heyde', 'Tehrani', 'husband', 'Morteza', 'cheating', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'Simin', 'woman', 'who', 'set', 'up', 'beauty', 'salon', 'there', 'own', 'marriage', 'broke', 'up', 'course', 'day', 'Rouhi', 'fighting', 'couple', 'small', 'son', 'wife', 'sister', 'husband', 'beautician', 'engage', 'series', 'exchanges', 'confrontations', 'truth', 'unfolds.Of', 'course', 'central', 'conceit', 'film', 'residents', 'apartment', 'complex', 'would', 'trust', 'cleaning', 'lady', 'barely', 'know', 'so', 'much', 'would', 'confide', 'problems', 'absurd', 'one', 'point', 'Mojdeh', 'even', 'Rouhi', 'pick', 'young', 'son', 'school', 'only', 'known', 'few', 'hours', 'already', 'fetch', 'son', 'whom', 'never', 'met', 'Not', 'knowing', 'much', 'Iranian', 'culture', 'was', 'intrigued', 'relationship', 'Rouhi', 'boyfriend', 'suppose', 'Iran', 'being', 'culturally', 'conservative', 'country', 'relationship', 'marriage', 'non', 'sexual', 'yet', 'seem', 'so', 'close', 'loving', 'especially', 'opening', 'scenes', 'movie', 'movie', 'doesn', '8217', 'dwell', 'too', 'much', 'pity', 'don', '8217', 'see', 'much', 'young', 'love', 'Iranian', 'movies']",Fireworks Wednesday

1140448,A3UM5IR9AZL1WZ,B0013B34X0,"David Crumm ""Editor of ReadTheSpirit magazine""","[4, 4]","""Fireworks Wednesday"" is a fascinating glimpse into the lives of men and women living in contemporary Iran. It's fiction, but it's a compelling and honest contemporary story of an idealistic young woman from a working-class background who is on the verge of getting married -- and takes on a job as a cleaning woman for an up-scale family to make some extra money.She shows up in the midst of disaster. The husband seems to be a brute, there's broken glass strewn across the floor and the man's wife shows up soon -- full of upper-class biases and in the midst of an emotional crisis over her husband's behavior. It's not entirely clear, at first, what has happened in the household -- but watching this drama is an amazing window in the lives of everyday Iranian families.For Americans, one of the enormous challenges in our world today is seeing the humanity in distant nations -- especially nations like Iran with which our nation's leaders seem to be crossing swords. Spending a couple of hours with this Iranian melodrama puts sympathetic human faces on people half a world away. And that's an important thing in times of global tension.This is well-written drama with sophisticated characters and a plot that keeps us guessing along the way -- whether we see ourselves in the roles of the older upper-class couple struggling to come to terms with an explosive marriage or we see the world through the eyes of the idealistic young woman about to get married.",4,A Rare Window into the Daily Lives of Families Far Away,1212019200,"05 29, 2008",2008,1463,"['Fireworks', 'Wednesday', 'fascinating', 'glimpse', 'lives', 'men', 'women', 'living', 'contemporary', 'Iran', 'fiction', 'compelling', 'honest', 'contemporary', 'story', 'idealistic', 'young', 'woman', 'working-class', 'background', 'who', 'verge', 'getting', 'married', 'job', 'cleaning', 'woman', 'up-scale', 'family', 'make', 'extra', 'money.She', 'up', 'midst', 'disaster', 'husband', 'be', 'brute', 'broken', 'glass', 'strewn', 'floor', 'man', 'wife', 'up', 'soon', 'full', 'upper-class', 'biases', 'midst', 'emotional', 'crisis', 'husband', 'behavior', 'not', 'entirely', 'clear', 'first', 'what', 'happened', 'household', 'watching', 'drama', 'amazing', 'window', 'lives', 'everyday', 'Iranian', 'families.For', 'Americans', 'one', 'enormous', 'challenges', 'world', 'today', 'seeing', 'humanity', 'distant', 'nations', 'especially', 'nations', 'Iran', 'nation', 'leaders', 'seem', 'be', 'crossing', 'swords', 'Spending', 'couple', 'hours', 'Iranian', 'melodrama', 'sympathetic', 'human', 'people', 'world', 'away', 'important', 'thing', 'times', 'global', 'tension.This', 'well-written', 'drama', 'sophisticated', 'characters', 'plot', 'guessing', 'way', 'see', 'roles', 'older', 'upper-class', 'couple', 'struggling', 'come', 'terms', 'explosive', 'marriage', 'see', 'world', 'eyes', 'idealistic', 'young', 'woman', 'get', 'married']",Fireworks Wednesday

1140450,AGVWTYW0ULXHT,B0013B34X0,"Nathan Andersen ""Gadget lover and author of S...","[15, 15]","Rouhi is engaged and very much in love, and goes to work as a maid in the house of a couple on the verge of a meltdown.  The wife is a nervous and suspicious wreck, and the messy house and broken window confirm that this is not a scene of domestic tranquility.  Throughout the day, Rouhi becomes increasingly involved in the lives of the wife, her husband and their child, and the woman who the wife suspects of being her husband's mistress.  She takes sides and later regrets it; she is used as a pawn in an elaborate contest between the husband and wife.  Along the way she must begin to wonder about her own dreams of a happy ever after.The film takes place on the Wednesday prior to the Iranian New Year, when according to tradition there is a fireworks celebration in the streets.  One of the most engaging and frightening scenes occurs as the husband drives Rouhi home through streets ablaze and abuzz with explosions, rockets, bonfires.  The sounds, lights and explosions that surround them as they speed through the streets, avoiding flames, mirrors the volatility of the marriage -- and accelerates the tension within the car, given the husband's suspicion that Rouhi may have betrayed him to his wife.Fireworks Wednesday is an honest and subtle and provocative film that takes a very simple and utterly believable story and lets a set of complicated issues weave in and through it effortlessly.  A very intriguing portrait of life in Tehran, with exceptionally delicate and convincing performances, and masterful direction that is able to take a scene from everyday life and render it extremely interesting and unsettling and suspenseful.",5,A young Iranian woman is about to be married ... an incendiary marriage is about to explode,1205452800,"03 14, 2008",2008,1648,"['Rouhi', 'engaged', 'very', 'much', 'love', 'work', 'maid', 'house', 'couple', 'verge', 'meltdown', 'wife', 'nervous', 'suspicious', 'wreck', 'messy', 'house', 'broken', 'window', 'confirm', 'not', 'scene', 'domestic', 'tranquility', 'day', 'Rouhi', 'increasingly', 'involved', 'lives', 'wife', 'husband', 'child', 'woman', 'who', 'wife', 'being', 'husband', 'mistress', 'sides', 'later', 'regrets', 'used', 'pawn', 'elaborate', 'contest', 'husband', 'wife', 'way', 'must', 'begin', 'wonder', 'own', 'dreams', 'happy', 'ever', 'after.The', 'film', 'place', 'Wednesday', 'prior', 'Iranian', 'New', 'Year', 'when', 'according', 'tradition', 'fireworks', 'celebration', 'streets', 'One', 'most', 'engaging', 'frightening', 'scenes', 'occurs', 'husband', 'Rouhi', 'home', 'streets', 'ablaze', 'abuzz', 'explosions', 'rockets', 'bonfires', 'sounds', 'lights', 'explosions', 'surround', 'speed', 'streets', 'avoiding', 'flames', 'mirrors', 'volatility', 'marriage', 'tension', 'car', 'given', 'husband', 'suspicion', 'Rouhi', 'may', 'have', 'betrayed', 'wife.Fireworks', 'Wednesday', 'honest', 'subtle', 'provocative', 'film', 'very', 'simple', 'utterly', 'believable', 'story', 'set', 'complicated', 'issues', 'weave', 'effortlessly', 'very', 'intriguing', 'portrait', 'life', 'Tehran', 'exceptionally', 'delicate', 'convincing', 'performances', 'masterful', 'direction', 'able', 'take', 'scene', 'everyday', 'life', 'render', 'extremely', 'interesting', 'unsettling', 'suspenseful']",Fireworks Wednesday
