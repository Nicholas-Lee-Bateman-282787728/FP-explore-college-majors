Each episode drew me deeper and deeper in and made me realize again that high art can come in many forms.  There is no comparing this series to QAF or anything else for that matter.  This series stands on its own, as it's own unique body of work.  With stand out performances by EVERY actor, even those with very small supporting roles, it is truly something worth your time and does not leave you feeling like you wasted part of your life.

1693375,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B00I3P3BF0,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[8, 8]","This is the Canadian TV, Mini Series that will inevitably draw comparisons to the UK's `Queer as Folk'. It tells the quite `explosive' lives of a group on Montrealers but mainly with a gay context. Mathieu is a photographer who has been sowing some wild oats after splitting with long term partner Ian; but then he turns up on the scene again after being the victim of a homophobic attack. We also have Gen who is married to Olivier, she is a doctor and he is a cop and he is also sleeping with his wife's work colleague Hugo.Then we have street kid and AIDS carrier Teo who lesbian Caroline - a social worker- is trying to save. She also wants to have a baby with her lover. We also have a transsexual Mexican lady who steals every scene  she is in - there is a lot crammed in here; I feel like saying the old `SOAP' phrase - `confused? You will be!' etc.  There are scenes of a sexual nature but nothing too full on and some drug taking and some violence, but actually it is all done quite tastefully.The only real issue is that this is twelve episodes and they last about twelve to fifteen minutes each, so these are very bite sized indeed. Whilst the makers cram as much drama as possible into each segment it can get frustrating as soon as you get hooked the ruddy thing goes and ends and you have to press the scene skip to get to the next episode. Still I found it very gripping and watched the whole lot in one go. This would make a brilliant film and if they are going to make more - which I hope they will- then please be brave enough to make longer versions as I think the quality of the programme deserves it, in French, English and a smattering of Spanish with OK to average sub titles - this is really quite good.",4,Canadian Gay TV Mini series,1392422400,"02 15, 2014",2014,1727,"['Canadian', 'TV', 'Mini', 'Series', 'will', 'inevitably', 'draw', 'comparisons', 'UK', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'quite', 'explosive', 'lives', 'group', 'Montrealers', 'mainly', 'gay', 'context', 'Mathieu', 'photographer', 'who', 'been', 'sowing', 'wild', 'oats', 'splitting', 'long', 'term', 'partner', 'Ian', 'then', 'up', 'scene', 'again', 'being', 'victim', 'homophobic', 'attack', 'also', 'have', 'Gen', 'who', 'married', 'Olivier', 'doctor', 'cop', 'also', 'sleeping', 'wife', 'work', 'colleague', 'Hugo.Then', 'have', 'street', 'kid', 'AIDS', 'carrier', 'Teo', 'who', 'lesbian', 'Caroline', 'social', 'worker-', 'trying', 'save', 'also', 'have', 'baby', 'lover', 'also', 'have', 'transsexual', 'Mexican', 'lady', 'who', 'scene', 'lot', 'crammed', 'here', 'feel', 'saying', 'old', 'SOAP', 'phrase', 'confused', 'will', 'be', 'etc', 'are', 'scenes', 'sexual', 'nature', 'nothing', 'too', 'full', 'drug', 'taking', 'violence', 'actually', 'done', 'quite', 'tastefully.The', 'only', 'real', 'issue', 'twelve', 'episodes', 'last', 'twelve', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'are', 'very', 'bite', 'sized', 'indeed', 'Whilst', 'makers', 'cram', 'much', 'drama', 'possible', 'segment', 'can', 'get', 'frustrating', 'as', 'soon', 'get', 'hooked', 'ruddy', 'thing', 'ends', 'have', 'press', 'scene', 'skip', 'get', 'next', 'episode', 'Still', 'found', 'very', 'gripping', 'watched', 'whole', 'lot', 'one', 'go', 'would', 'make', 'brilliant', 'film', 'are', 'going', 'make', 'more', 'hope', 'will-', 'then', 'please', 'be', 'brave', 'enough', 'make', 'longer', 'versions', 'think', 'quality', 'programme', 'French', 'English', 'smattering', 'Spanish', 'OK', 'average', 'sub', 'titles', 'really', 'quite', 'good']",Coming Out: Season 1
