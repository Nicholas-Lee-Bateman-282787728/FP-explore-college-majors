The actors -- all well known stars -- are at the top of their game. Excellent direction. Particularly wonderful performances by Ed Asner, Gillian Jacobs (""Community"") and Kevin Hart.

It surpassed my expectations.  I especially liked Kevin Hart's role (which I think his acting was impressive since he's only done comedy), but the others were really good also.  The only thing I didn't like about this movie was the acting of the female lead role.  She wasn't a very good actress, and I think the part could have been done alot better, but because of who the character was, it did work well enough.  (The character is a very fake personality, so with this person playing it, the fake-ness was obvious, a little too obvious)  But I thought the concept was not extremely original, but really interesting.  Over all, a great movie, well done.",5,Almost Perfect,1359936000,"02 4, 2013",2013,780,"['was', 'awesome', 'movie', 'am', 'planning', 'watching', 'again', 'soon', 'totally', 'took', 'chance', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'surpassed', 'expectations', 'especially', 'liked', 'Kevin', 'Hart', 'role', 'think', 'acting', 'was', 'impressive', 'only', 'done', 'comedy', 'others', 'were', 'really', 'good', 'also', 'only', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'was', 'acting', 'female', 'lead', 'role', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'actress', 'think', 'part', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'alot', 'better', 'who', 'character', 'was', 'did', 'work', 'well', 'enough', 'character', 'very', 'fake', 'personality', 'so', 'person', 'playing', 'fake-ness', 'was', 'obvious', 'little', 'too', 'obvious', 'thought', 'concept', 'was', 'not', 'extremely', 'original', 'really', 'interesting', 'great', 'movie', 'well', 'done']",Let Go

1546026,ASEBX8TBYWQWA,B0084CAU9C,"Steven I. Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[1, 6]","For years I loved Ed Asner's acting on TV - first on the comedy The Mary Tyler Moore Show and later on the dramatic TV series Lou Grant. I've seen him act on stage and I was always impressed. Two years ago he provided the voice for one of the characters in Pixar's animated film ""up"". Another triumph. But lately.....In the last six months I've seen two ""independent"" films with Asner's name at the top of the cast and both had him playing a crusty old man, who the filmmaker wanted you to sympathize with. Now comes this film with Asner in the ""same old, same old"" caricature role. And why is he here? Probably because - as you'll find out if you make it through the 108 minutes to the closing credits - he is the film's Executive Producer!I like small independent films but this was a huge let down. The characters were overdrawn to be a parody - when some are supposed to be serious. The camera angles are so bad that the adults look like they are sitting on child furniture. And the makeup is atrocious, especially on the women. I wasn't familiar with any of the cast except Asner and Simon Helberg (one of the four ""brainiacs"" on ""The Big Bang Theory"" - a show I love. You'll see Helberg's picture on both the front and the back of the DVD package but don't expect to see much of him in this film. His role is so small; you might miss him.The ""star"" - David Denman - looks like a poor man's Will Farrell. And acts like a piece of cardboard.The DVD comes with a feature length audio commentary with both the writer/director and Denman. I did not have the patience to sit through that.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",2,"Low budget ""independent"" that has Ed Asner ""slumming"".

He is straight and wears sweaters like Rick Santorum and is just as boring. His character is contrasted by a gaggle of colorful characters which include the supporting minor roles.He has three parolees whose lives we follow.Darla (Gillian Jacobs) She is a pretty blond who is amoral, manipulative, and has her own jazz swagger music. She went to jail for selling her engagement ring on E-Bay. As it turns out her boyfriend stole it.Artie Satz (Edward Asner) He has a long rap sheet for armed robbery. He is a curmudgeon's curmudgeon. He doesn't need anyone. He was ""survived two world wars, the Great Depression and that Coke crap they tried to pull in the eighties.""Kris Styles (Kevin Hart). He is a doctor who was convicted of bilking insurance companies. He can no longer practice and is wealthy enough not to work. The kicker is that work is part of his parole so he finds himself in blue collar jobs that don't suit him. He has ex-wife emotional baggage.The film concentrates on creating memorable characters down to the Goth at the coffee shop to the over bubbly career counselor. The film is humorous and well done.

He finds that helping them he starts to help himself. Going in I was not really looking forward to this that much. The preview made it look OK but I still thought it could be a little slow moving. This was the opposite. The humor was really funny but still a little quirky. Kevin Hart was great in this and he really stole the movie. There really isn't too much to this movie other then all four of the main people trying to straighten out their lives but this is worth seeing.
