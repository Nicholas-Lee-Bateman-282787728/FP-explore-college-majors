I think it is one of the best movies ever made in history!!!I laughed all the way from the beggining to the end of the movie. I think SANDLER is one of the best actors EVER.He is very talented. I suggest you watch this movie, I'm not gonna tell you what the movie is all about or I will spoil it, just go and watch this one anywhere and anyhow.If you're on the comedy type of movies (I am more of a suspense movie fan), then this one is perfect for you.

47026,AYGHUCNGQ0HMF,0783219105,aaron wittenberg,"[0, 1]","This review might help some other potential viewers who feel the same way about Adam Sandler as I do. For the record, I CAN'T STAND him at all. I do NOT think he is funny at all. I watched many of his SNL skits over the years. He should have been fired he was SO unfunny. His sense of humor flat out sucked.So why would I bother then if I can't stand him? I read DOZENS of reviews about The Wedding Singer. I knew he was in it. It really sounded STUPID, and the fact that Adam Sandler was in it was the reason I wouldn't watch it. As I have said, I don't find him funny at all. He SNL humor just sucks.The ONLY reason I watched The Wedding Singer is because of the 80's theme. I am a HUGE 80's fan, and I wanted to see how they revived the decade. I finally watched it a few days ago and it was actually VERY funny. I don't like romantic comedies at all (romantic comedy is like Microsoft and stable, they should never be in the same sentence). After I finished The Wedding Singer and saw that he actually CAN be funny outside of SNL, I decided to give Happy Gilmore a shot.The first thing that comes to mind is this movie seems to be a take off on Caddyshack. While they might not have tried to rip it off, they seemed to. Some of the scenes are so funny that I had to pause it I was laughing so hard. One of the earliest scenes that I found hilarious is when he was playing golf during a live broadcast. He couldn't hit the ball right and started beating it with his club, then every other word was swearing. The scene cut to the executives office with the TV in the background and all you heard was &lt;bleep&gt; word &lt;bleep&gt; word &lt;bleep bleep&gt; word &lt;bleep&gt; you son of &lt;bleep&gt; you mother &lt;bleep&gt; &lt;bleep&gt;. After that scene was over I was still laughing for a good 2 minutes. He does that a lot in the movie.The plot outline is that he grew up wanting to be a hockey player, but was always rejected. He visits his grandmother (I think thats who she was), and finds out her house is getting reposessed because she hasn't paid her taxes in over 10 years. Somehow he winds up on the golf course and finds out that he can hit the ball HUNDREDS of yards. After talks with a coach and several failed attempts, he reluctantly joins a golf tournament in an effort to win enough money to buy her house back. He meets up with a legendary golfer who he is trying to beat in the tournament for the money and a trophy.There is more to it than that, but this should give you an overview of what the movie is about.Essentially, I'm writing this because I do know of some others who can't stand Adam Sandler either. He was in my top 5 of most hated comedians. I have seen his acting on SNL, some of his stand up comedy, and it just was NOT funny.Well so far I have seen The Wedding Singer, Happy Gilmore, and Little Nicky. All were pretty funny. Not the funniest I have ever seen, but for someone who can't stand him as much as me, I was pretty surprised that I liked them.His attitude during the movie is great. He loses his cool, wants to physically beat people and objects, curses CONSTANTLY, and some of his one liners are admittedly VERY funny. If you remember the bar scene with the one liners that rhymed, then you know what I mean. I won't spoil it by telling.Even if you can't stand and completely despise Adam Sandler (like me), give his movies a shot. His acting and comedy outside SNL is better in my opinion. I will never watch his SNL performances again.Happy Gilmore is basically Caddyshack with fighting, cursing, and funny one liners.",5,Very funny movie that follows the Caddyshack theme,1002931200,"10 13, 2001",2001,3572,"['review', 'might', 'help', 'other', 'potential', 'viewers', 'who', 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'do', 'record', 'CA', ""N'T"", 'STAND', 'do', 'NOT', 'think', 'funny', 'watched', 'many', 'SNL', 'years', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'fired', 'was', 'SO', 'unfunny', 'sense', 'humor', 'flat', 'out', 'sucked.So', 'why', 'would', 'bother', 'then', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'read', 'DOZENS', 'reviews', 'Wedding', 'Singer', 'knew', 'was', 'really', 'sounded', 'STUPID', 'fact', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'was', 'was', 'reason', 'would', ""n't"", 'watch', 'have', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'funny', 'SNL', 'humor', 'just', 'sucks.The', 'ONLY', 'reason', 'watched', 'Wedding', 'Singer', '80', 'theme', 'am', 'HUGE', '80', 'fan', 'wanted', 'see', 'how', 'revived', 'decade', 'finally', 'watched', 'few', 'days', 'ago', 'was', 'actually', 'VERY', 'funny', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Microsoft', 'stable', 'should', 'never', 'be', 'same', 'sentence', 'finished', 'Wedding', 'Singer', 'saw', 'actually', 'CAN', 'be', 'funny', 'SNL', 'decided', 'give', 'Happy', 'Gilmore', 'shot.The', 'first', 'thing', 'mind', 'movie', 'be', 'take', 'off', 'Caddyshack', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'tried', 'rip', 'off', 'seemed', 'scenes', 'are', 'so', 'funny', 'had', 'pause', 'was', 'laughing', 'so', 'hard', 'One', 'earliest', 'scenes', 'found', 'hilarious', 'when', 'was', 'playing', 'golf', 'live', 'broadcast', 'could', ""n't"", 'hit', 'ball', 'right', 'started', 'beating', 'club', 'then', 'other', 'word', 'was', 'swearing', 'scene', 'cut', 'executives', 'office', 'TV', 'background', 'heard', 'was', 'lt', 'gt', 'word', 'lt', 'gt', 'word', 'lt', 'bleep', 'gt', 'word', 'lt', 'gt', 'son', 'lt', 'gt', 'mother', 'lt', 'bleep', 'gt', 'lt', 'gt', 'scene', 'was', 'was', 'still', 'laughing', 'good', '2', 'minutes', 'lot', 'movie.The', 'plot', 'outline', 'grew', 'up', 'wanting', 'be', 'hockey', 'player', 'was', 'always', 'rejected', 'grandmother', 'think', 'thats', 'who', 'was', 'out', 'house', 'getting', 'reposessed', ""n't"", 'paid', 'taxes', '10', 'years', 'Somehow', 'up', 'golf', 'course', 'out', 'can', 'hit', 'ball', 'HUNDREDS', 'yards', 'talks', 'coach', 'several', 'failed', 'attempts', 'reluctantly', 'golf', 'tournament', 'effort', 'win', 'enough', 'money', 'buy', 'house', 'back', 'up', 'legendary', 'golfer', 'who', 'trying', 'beat', 'tournament', 'money', 'trophy.There', 'more', 'should', 'give', 'overview', 'what', 'movie', 'about.Essentially', ""'m"", 'writing', 'do', 'know', 'others', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'either', 'was', 'top', '5', 'most', 'hated', 'comedians', 'have', 'seen', 'acting', 'SNL', 'stand', 'up', 'comedy', 'just', 'was', 'NOT', 'funny.Well', 'far', 'have', 'seen', 'Wedding', 'Singer', 'Happy', 'Gilmore', 'Little', 'Nicky', 'were', 'pretty', 'funny', 'Not', 'funniest', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'someone', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'as', 'much', 'was', 'pretty', 'surprised', 'liked', 'them.His', 'attitude', 'movie', 'great', 'cool', 'physically', 'beat', 'people', 'objects', 'curses', 'CONSTANTLY', 'one', 'liners', 'are', 'admittedly', 'VERY', 'funny', 'remember', 'bar', 'scene', 'one', 'liners', 'rhymed', 'then', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'telling.Even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'completely', 'despise', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'give', 'movies', 'shot', 'acting', 'comedy', 'SNL', 'better', 'opinion', 'will', 'never', 'watch', 'SNL', 'performances', 'again.Happy', 'Gilmore', 'basically', 'Caddyshack', 'fighting', 'cursing', 'funny', 'one', 'liners']",N/A

Here is how it goes: A young man named Happy Gilmore is a failure at hockey. Why? Because his skills and talents are meant for GOLF! So he decides to play it, and this is as good a time as any. Seems a big jerk named Shooter McGavin, who is the golf tournament champion currently, has decided to take the house of Happy's grandma and leave her and her grandson on the street. The only way for Happy to get back his Grandma's home is to win this year's tournament and win the gold jacket, which will result in him being rich enough for him and his grandma to both have a home & live happily. He soon proves to be better than even Shooter himself, as he keeps on winning over and over. Shooter, of course, is taken aback. In the final round, it looks as if Shooter has won. Will Happy Gilmore be able to win this last round and save his grandma, house and life? See this masterpiece and find out. And you will love it. It's a funny, interesting, sweet, and slapsticky movie all in one. There are all sorts of funny quotes, some more than others, there are funny moments, and you will laugh out loud throughout viewing time.

47033,A36YGQN7LQZKQU,0783219105,Banjo Benny,"[0, 0]","What I loved about this movie was the ACTING. It works because Adam Sandler is brllliantly &quot;real&quot; at all times, even though he plays a silly character in silly situations. His commitment to the role is  breathtaking. Somehow you really believe this character would punch out his  caddy, go beserk on national television, have a heated argument with a  golfball, and threaten a plastic clown face with death! Yet at the same  time, the character has an innocence and guilelessness that allows us to  forgive him his excentricities. He's just an Everyman who is out of his  element, trying to find his way. If he causes tumult and chaos in the area  around him, it is forgivable because he is only doing what he has been  trained to do, for all of his previous life. &quot;Happy&quot; remains a  likeable character even while he is punching out Bob Barker! That is the  genius of this movie.People might tell you the plot of this movie, and  all the funny skits that are in this movie, but you still might not get it.  I don't think I would have &quot;gotten it&quot; just by hearing a  recounting of the plot. The script is funny, and it's a good vehicle, but  the reason I have watched this movie over and over again is because Adam  Sandler is SUCH a good actor. He makes you BELIEVE. Comedians never get  enough credit for this, but in a movie like this one, which is really a  pretty bizarre situation, it is his ability to take us into a mode of  suspended reality that makes the movie work: he makes the incredible  plausible.

Take Adam Sandler and put him on the PGA tour, then sit back and wait for the hilarity to ensue.  Happy Gilmore is one of the funniest films of the 1990s, and it is actually pretty uplifting to all of us who love to cheer for the underdog.  There's nothing really intellectual about this film, and that's perfectly OK.  We have our underdog, Happy Gilmore; his only dream in life is to be a professional hockey player, but the only thing he brings to the ice is a quick temper.  Then we have the lovable grandmother put in a precarious situation-her house, which her own late husband built, has been seized by the government as a result of her not paying taxes for ten years.  Happy accidentally discovers his ability to hit a golf ball very, very far, tries to rustle up some money off of bets at the local links, and almost accidentally, with the help of Chubbs, the local pro who saw his own promising golf career come to and end after an unfortunate encounter with an alligator, finds himself on the pro golf tour.  Then there is the undeniably arrogant and completely unlikable bad guy, Shooter McGowan, whose place atop golf's elite is threatened by the young upstart Happy.  Of course, this kind of story calls for a leading lady, as well, and the businesslike yet increasingly desirable tour media director Virginia Venit (Julie Bowen) fits the bill to a tee (I swear this pun was entirely unintentional).Of course, the funniest parts of the movie take place on the golf course when the hockey-minded Happy takes out his early frustrations.  At his first pro event, he launches into one profanity-laced (mostly bleeped) tirade after another, throwing clubs, having in-your-face discussions with his uncooperative golf balls, and generally being very ungolfer-like.  Of course, the fans love it, so the PGA decides not to throw him out.  With Virginia's help, he manages to keep his behavior at a PG level, at least until the pro-am tournament.  Faced with a relentless heckler and a constantly complaining partner in Bob Barker, he snaps and has a go at Bob.  Hey, Bob Barker had it coming.  Faced with a month-long suspension, everything is on the line, both his grandmother's house and his own future golf career, at the PGA championship where he and Shooter compete for the gold jacket.  If you take away some of the profanity early on, Happy Gilmore is actually a pretty family-oriented little movie, and I for one certainly enjoy seeing the biggest underdog imaginable come out on top over the arrogant and despicable favorite.",5,"Hey, Bob Barker had it coming",1039824000,"12 14, 2002",2002,2576,"['idea', 'crazy', 'enough', 'work', 'Take', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'put', 'PGA', 'tour', 'then', 'sit', 'back', 'wait', 'hilarity', 'ensue', 'Happy', 'Gilmore', 'one', 'funniest', 'films', '1990s', 'actually', 'pretty', 'uplifting', 'who', 'love', 'cheer', 'underdog', 'nothing', 'really', 'intellectual', 'film', 'perfectly', 'OK.', 'have', 'underdog', 'Happy', 'Gilmore', 'only', 'dream', 'life', 'be', 'professional', 'hockey', 'player', 'only', 'thing', 'ice', 'quick', 'temper', 'Then', 'have', 'lovable', 'grandmother', 'put', 'precarious', 'situation-her', 'house', 'own', 'late', 'husband', 'built', 'been', 'seized', 'government', 'result', 'not', 'paying', 'taxes', 'ten', 'years', 'Happy', 'accidentally', 'ability', 'hit', 'golf', 'ball', 'very', 'very', 'far', 'tries', 'rustle', 'up', 'money', 'bets', 'local', 'links', 'almost', 'accidentally', 'help', 'Chubbs', 'local', 'pro', 'who', 'saw', 'own', 'promising', 'golf', 'career', 'come', 'end', 'unfortunate', 'encounter', 'alligator', 'pro', 'golf', 'tour', 'Then', 'undeniably', 'arrogant', 'completely', 'unlikable', 'bad', 'guy', 'Shooter', 'McGowan', 'place', 'atop', 'golf', 'elite', 'threatened', 'young', 'upstart', 'Happy', 'course', 'kind', 'story', 'calls', 'leading', 'lady', 'as', 'well', 'businesslike', 'yet', 'increasingly', 'desirable', 'tour', 'media', 'director', 'Virginia', 'Venit', 'Julie', 'Bowen', 'bill', 'tee', 'swear', 'pun', 'was', 'entirely', 'unintentional', '.Of', 'course', 'funniest', 'parts', 'movie', 'take', 'place', 'golf', 'course', 'when', 'hockey-minded', 'Happy', 'out', 'early', 'frustrations', 'first', 'pro', 'event', 'one', 'profanity-laced', 'mostly', 'bleeped', 'tirade', 'throwing', 'clubs', 'having', 'in-your-face', 'discussions', 'uncooperative', 'golf', 'balls', 'generally', 'being', 'very', 'ungolfer-like', 'course', 'fans', 'love', 'PGA', 'not', 'throw', 'out', 'Virginia', 'help', 'keep', 'behavior', 'PG', 'level', 'least', 'pro-am', 'tournament', 'Faced', 'relentless', 'heckler', 'constantly', 'complaining', 'partner', 'Bob', 'Barker', 'go', 'Bob', 'Hey', 'Bob', 'Barker', 'had', 'coming', 'Faced', 'month-long', 'suspension', 'everything', 'line', 'grandmother', 'house', 'own', 'future', 'golf', 'career', 'PGA', 'championship', 'where', 'Shooter', 'compete', 'gold', 'jacket', 'take', 'away', 'profanity', 'early', 'Happy', 'Gilmore', 'actually', 'pretty', 'family-oriented', 'little', 'movie', 'one', 'certainly', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'biggest', 'underdog', 'imaginable', 'come', 'out', 'top', 'arrogant', 'despicable', 'favorite']",N/A

47057,A1LACH6MLQWZ,0783219105,Doug Erlandson,"[1, 1]","Adam Sandler is outstanding as Happy Gilmore, a wannabe hockey player (who is never good enough to make the team, but is great at fighting), who, when his grandmother's house is repossessed by the IRS because she hasn't paid her income taxes in ten years, takes a golf club from his late grandfather's bag, tees it up on the lawn, and launches a drive of nearly four hundred yards. The two workers, who are in the process of removing furniture from the grandma's house, can hardly believe their eyes. But when he repeats the feat two more times they are convinced. Although all Happy Gilmore wants is to become a hockey star, he enters a golf tournament, the winner of which will be allowed to compete on the pro tour. Despite a terrible short game (his putting is atrocious) he wins the tournament.Soon he is the talk of the tour. His drives of nearly four hundred feet are legendary, as are his antics, which are extremely flamboyant (to say the least) and are resented by the staid members of the tour. However, he is allowed to continue because the TV ratings are skyrocketing as a result of his antics. Conflict arises when Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald), who has never won the most prestigious tour event but is the favorite to do so, sees Gilmore as a real threat and does everything to thwart him. For his part, the only reason Gilmore wants to win tournaments is because he wants to make enough money to pay off his grandma's IRS bill so she can keep her house.This brief description of the basic plot is hardly adequate to convey how consistently funny this movie is. Let's just say that I laughed most of the way through it.At the same time, one has to suspend his disbelief for a number of reasons. Here are just a few instances: First off, Gilmore's unique approach of taking a running start before hitting his drives would never result in such picture-perfect and accurate drives as he almost always launches. Second, no one in real life hits drives approaching four hundred yards. Third, Gilmore's antics are so over the top that they would never be countenanced on the tour, no matter what the TV ratings might be, nor would he be allowed to so consistently violate the dress code.However, despite this, it's a great movie, and, if you watch it for its comedic effect and not as a portrayal of real life, you'll love it.",5,"Funny, funny, funny",1382140800,"10 19, 2013",2013,2344,"['Adam', 'Sandler', 'outstanding', 'Happy', 'Gilmore', 'wannabe', 'hockey', 'player', 'who', 'never', 'good', 'enough', 'make', 'team', 'great', 'fighting', 'who', 'when', 'grandmother', 'house', 'repossessed', 'IRS', ""n't"", 'paid', 'income', 'taxes', 'ten', 'years', 'golf', 'club', 'late', 'grandfather', 'bag', 'up', 'lawn', 'drive', 'nearly', 'four', 'hundred', 'yards', 'two', 'workers', 'who', 'are', 'process', 'removing', 'furniture', 'grandma', 'house', 'can', 'hardly', 'believe', 'eyes', 'when', 'feat', 'two', 'more', 'times', 'are', 'convinced', 'Happy', 'Gilmore', 'become', 'hockey', 'star', 'golf', 'tournament', 'winner', 'will', 'be', 'allowed', 'compete', 'pro', 'tour', 'terrible', 'short', 'game', 'putting', 'atrocious', 'tournament.Soon', 'talk', 'tour', 'drives', 'nearly', 'four', 'hundred', 'feet', 'are', 'legendary', 'are', 'antics', 'are', 'extremely', 'flamboyant', 'say', 'least', 'are', 'resented', 'staid', 'members', 'tour', 'However', 'allowed', 'continue', 'TV', 'ratings', 'are', 'skyrocketing', 'result', 'antics', 'Conflict', 'when', 'Shooter', 'McGavin', 'Christopher', 'McDonald', 'who', 'never', 'won', 'most', 'prestigious', 'tour', 'event', 'favorite', 'do', 'so', 'Gilmore', 'real', 'threat', 'everything', 'thwart', 'part', 'only', 'reason', 'Gilmore', 'win', 'tournaments', 'make', 'enough', 'money', 'pay', 'off', 'grandma', 'IRS', 'bill', 'can', 'keep', 'house.This', 'brief', 'description', 'basic', 'plot', 'hardly', 'adequate', 'convey', 'how', 'consistently', 'movie', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'laughed', 'most', 'way', 'it.At', 'same', 'time', 'one', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'number', 'reasons', 'Here', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'instances', 'First', 'off', 'Gilmore', 'unique', 'approach', 'taking', 'running', 'start', 'hitting', 'drives', 'would', 'never', 'result', 'such', 'picture-perfect', 'accurate', 'drives', 'almost', 'always', 'launches', 'Second', 'one', 'real', 'life', 'drives', 'approaching', 'four', 'hundred', 'yards', 'Third', 'Gilmore', 'antics', 'are', 'so', 'top', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'countenanced', 'tour', 'matter', 'what', 'TV', 'ratings', 'might', 'be', 'would', 'be', 'allowed', 'so', 'consistently', 'violate', 'dress', 'code.However', 'great', 'movie', 'watch', 'comedic', 'effect', 'not', 'portrayal', 'real', 'life', ""'ll"", 'love']",N/A

He gets in many fights in this movie, one with Bob Barker I might add.The story starts out with the audience finding out that he has tried out for this Minnesota hockey team too many times and has never been accepted.  He has had enough of this happening to him so he tries to stab someone with his skate.He leaves the ice and later on a used to be golfer with a wooden hand noticed his ability and soon enough he is on the PGA tour.  The only catch is, he doesn't want to be someone that wears tight clothing and volleyball hats while playing golf....he wants fans cheering, beach-balls being hit, and fans calling his name.A rival golfer hates this and tries to get rid of him and that is where the story takes off.  Sandler plays a great role and is very funny of course.

This film is just straight fun to me, no brain power and interesting situations and characters make for a good time. Sure the humor is juvenile and some times stupid but that is the point. It is a straight forward comedy and for some reason I love it. Plus you have to love anything that says ""it's all in the hips"".Happy Gilmore is a hockey player want to be who doesn't have all the skills necessary but has a great slap shot. One day he finds out that his grandmother is loosing her house and there is nothing really he can do about it. That is until he discovers golf after making a bet with some guys and drives the ball farther than either of them can. After one of them makes a simple little comment he decides to try his hand at golf, well once he learns that he can make the ""big bucks"". So off Happy goes trying to win as much money as possible to save his grandmothers house.This still to this day is one of my favorite movies because, well I don't know why but I love it for some reason. Could be that I am a huge hockey fan or maybe because Bob Barker beats up Adam Sandler but I love it. It could of course also be that Christopher McDonald is perfect as Shooter and Ben Stiller is an excellent villain here as well, maybe it is all of that. Any way this movie is not for everybody but for those who get it they will love it.Written by Sandler and Tim Herlihy and directed by Dennis Dugan ""Happy Gilmore"" is one of those flicks that is just dumb fun. If you like it you like it if you don't you don't, it doesn't really matter, for those who do love it. Sandler was at an all time best here in fact I think his earlier films are his best ones, well at least the most fun. McDonald is perfect as Shooter like I mentioned earlier, I have always liked that kind of jerk villain in a movie. Ben Stiller is as well great here as the guy at the nursing home that is supposed to take care of Happy's grandmother. Of course Carl Weathers is brilliant as well as is Allen Covert, he may just be a scene stealer and he really doesn't have any lines.I am sure if you are no Sandler fan you are reading this rolling your eyes but I think you have it in you to like this flick. Any one who goes into this with the brain off and realizes that this film is just dumb fun then I think they will enjoy it. Sure it may not be a perfect movie but it is a fun one. I say give it a try if you never have and if you have give it one more.

The sub-plot featuring Ben Stiller as an orderly who runs a nursing home like a sweatshop is a perfect example of this. What stands out most about ""Happy Gilmore"", however, is that it actually manages to make golf seem interesting. With his hockey background, Gilmore turns his golfing tournaments into over-the-top madness by swearing, throwing around clubs and beating up other players, thus attracting scores of fans and it makes perfect sense, since while watching it, I kept on thinking how I would pay to watch this sort of thing, too. Hey, by buying this DVD, in effect I did. If you hate Sandler's other films, then you're probably going to hate this as well.

But I love this movie!!  It's a comic masterpiece that combines satire with sarcastic humor and the occasional ""cheap shot"" giggle.Sandler plays a hockey star wannabe whose Grandma is being harrassed by the IRS.  After ten years of not paying her taxes because she ""had no money"", her house is being repossessed as well as all her belongings.  Sandler, who works as a construction worker and tries out for hockey teams in his spare time, jumps in to save her.  But, being down and out himself, he finds he must make money (over $250,000) FAST.Sandler can hardly stand on skates and hockey really isn't his bag, no matter how badly he wishes it was.  But he has a wicked shot...which he uses on the golf course to get into a competition which will allow the winner to join the PGA.The story progresses from there.  The parts that really caught my attention were Happy's fiery temper.  He is most hilarious when he's poetically insulting fellow golfers (""why don't I just go make some things out of clay or eat some hay...I just may"") or beating the snot out of inanimate objects (""you're gonna DIE clown!"") or having the snot beat out of HIM by gameshow hosts.This movie has all the ingredients of a typical 90s Gen X comedy -- a love story, cheer for the underdog, wacky humor.

47113,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,0783219105,Michael Crane,"[9, 13]","Okay, so I finally broke down and bought a copy of ""Happy Gilmore"" on DVD.  Seeing that it has been more than a year since I have been waiting for a better version to come out, it seems like such a copy will not come out for a while.  It's a movie I absolutely love, so I decided to finally purchase it.  Besides, the day they re-release this on a more appropriate DVD, I will be the first in line to buy it.The movie itself is amazing, and should receive the five stars it deserves.  It's funny as hell, and is bound to cheer you up if you are having a god-awful day.  There is not one moment in this entire movie where I am not either laughing my brains out or smiling.  This is a classic Sandler film that never gets old.Adam Sandler plays Happy Gilmore; a guy who wants nothing more than to be a hockey player.  While he may have one hell of a slap-shot, he's terrible at everything else.  To make things worse, his grandma is forced to live in a home for the elderly due to not paying her taxes.  Happy needs to find a way to get the money to get the house back for her, and surprisingly, he finds it in a golfing tournament.  The golfing world has never seen the likes of Gilmore, for he is about to turn it upside down.The film is hilarious throughout with some really great lines and moments.  This is a movie you could watch over and over again, and is most likely one you will WANT to watch over and over again.  Forget what the critics think, this is an awesome movie.As for the DVD, it's not so awesome.  It lacks in special features, and what's worse is that it's FULLSCREEN!  I don't care if it's a comedy, it should be widescreen.  If it's a DVD, it should be widescreen, or it should at least have the option of both.  The picture and sound quality is really good, however.  It's just annoying that we are forced to watch it in fullscreen.  And yes, this was shot in widescreen.  It was in the theatres, and it was widescreen on the laserdisk version.  (Now that's pathetic.)If you're like me and are waiting for a better version to come out, I say you might as well purchase this copy.  Who knows when Universal is going to come out with a better version.  I've been waiting for a long time; more than a year.  It hasn't happened yet, and I don't think it's going to happen anytime soon.  So you might as well just pick up this copy and re-buy it when a better version comes out.  The movie is awesome on every front, it's just that the DVD is terrible.  However, it is possible to tolerate it, especially if you love the movie.  ""Happy Gilmore"" is a great film and deserves a better DVD for it.So I'm changing my one star rating to a three star rating.  Is the DVD tolerable?  Yes.  But that still doesn't mean it's a good thing.  Universal better come out with a better version.I don't even care if it has special features, just release it in widescreen.

Even if this film didn't have clever writing, a vast array a characters and a climactic competition between protagonist and antagonist, the movie would be great on premise alone. The film is made even funnier with the presence of a comedic antagonist in the person of Gilmore's arch-nemesis Shooter McGavin. The interplay between the two golfers is just one of the dynamics that drive this film to comedic Olympus. Perhaps I am a little biased being that I am an avid golfer, a former Subway employee (the Subway sandwich company is guilty of gratuitous and excessive product placement in the film), not to mention a huge Bob Barker fan. But personal preferences aside, I believe that anyone who enjoys laughing will enjoy Happy Gilmore.

The  basic story of this is pretty simple, it's about a guy who thinks he was  born to play hockey, but still hasn't made a team. Then he meets a guy with  a wooden hand who used to be a golf player, who tells him he should start.  So he does, and he's got an awesome drive, but his putting stinks. And he  has an arch enemy, a total a**hole named Shooter McGavin, who makes a total  fool of himself many times but still thinks himself a pretty cool guy.

Adam Sandler was at his best as the failed hockey player turned reluctant golfer.  Julie Bowen, in her first prominent role before becoming Carol Vessey on the brilliant Ed, was solid as the love interest that helps Happy compete.  Then there is my namesake Shooter McGavin as portrayed by the always reliable Christopher McDonald who plays the corny joke spewing adversary of Happy perfectly.  Even all the bit players were on point the most memorable being Donald, the dude who Shooter paid to annoy Happy that led to the Bob Barker beating.  It was because of him that ""jackass"" became the most used term of endearment, so to speak, among my college buddies.  On top of all that there were great cameos from Ben Stiller, Kevin Nealon, and Lee Travino.Rarely do long stretches of time go by without me quoting the movie or emulating a scene.

But the worse comes to Happy when his grandma who has not paid her bills (in like 10 years) loses her house and all her stuff. And Happy is order by the IRS to make the money that his grandma hasn't paid in 90 days, or the house will be sold. And he finds out when the movers, that are bringing in his grandma's stuff in his house, that when they take a break to play some golf, Happy bets that he can get the ball far from the mover's ball. And he finds out that he can hit golf balls really far, and is discoverd by a former golf play named Chubbs (Carl Weathers).

It's nice to see a good Adam Sandler movie after his more recent crimes against humanity.  This is a very easy going movie and a great film to watch if you are in the mood for some good laughs.  The unorthodox manner in which Sandler delivers his entertainment is rather refreshing throughout most of this picture and keeps the mood light for the length of the movie.I have to say I do take partial to the fact that Happy Gilmore is a washed up hockey player wannabe with more than a low-grade bad temper and a penchant for comedy.  I think we can all relate to Gilmore a little during the movie because sometimes you just want to throw things, hit people, scream loudly and make a big scene because your ticked off.The only truly far-fetched concept in this movie is that a Boston fan wins a championship.  Other than that, its a good movie to get into when you don't want to worry about reality too much.

Very much against his will, Happy abandons his hockey dreams to join the pro golf tour in order to earn the money to repurchase his grandmother's house from the IRS.  In the meantime, his sweet elderly grandmother gets to spend some quality time in a nursing home/sweat shop run by a demonic orderly (Ben Stiller).Now the only thing standing between Happy and getting the money he needs, the beautiful lady (Julie Bowen), winning the masters, and a successful golfing career is the fact that... well... he can't golf.  Compounding his misery is the fact that he's also blessed with a horrific temper, and a vocabulary that would make a sailor blush.  His growing pains and the ensuing drama make for one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.  One of the biggest highlights of the movie has to be the fist fight between Happy and gameshow host Bob Barker, but the entire movie is nonstop laughs.Of note is that there is definitely some language/violence to the movie, so the easily offended should avoid &quot;Happy Gilmore&quot;, and pretty much any Adam Sandler movie in general, but no fears... I'm sure disney has released something appropriately fluffy for you.  If you like great comedy though, or have any understanding of golf (or any sense of humor at all for that matter), than &quot;Happy Gilmore&quot; will be a thoroughly enjoyable experience for you.",5,You'll never watch golf the same way again,1064534400,"09 26, 2003",2003,1515,"['Adam', 'Sandler', 'aspiring', 'hockey', 'star', 'Happy', 'Gilmore', 'guy', 'amazing', 'slapshot', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'keep', 'feet', 'skates', 'Very', 'much', 'will', 'Happy', 'abandons', 'hockey', 'dreams', 'join', 'pro', 'golf', 'tour', 'order', 'earn', 'money', 'repurchase', 'grandmother', 'house', 'IRS', 'meantime', 'sweet', 'elderly', 'grandmother', 'spend', 'quality', 'time', 'nursing', 'home/sweat', 'shop', 'run', 'demonic', 'orderly', 'Ben', 'Stiller', '.Now', 'only', 'thing', 'standing', 'Happy', 'getting', 'money', 'beautiful', 'lady', 'Julie', 'Bowen', 'winning', 'masters', 'successful', 'golfing', 'career', 'fact', 'well', 'ca', ""n't"", 'golf', 'Compounding', 'misery', 'fact', 'also', 'blessed', 'horrific', 'temper', 'vocabulary', 'would', 'make', 'sailor', 'blush', 'growing', 'pains', 'ensuing', 'drama', 'make', 'one', 'funniest', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'One', 'biggest', 'highlights', 'movie', 'be', 'fist', 'fight', 'Happy', 'gameshow', 'host', 'Bob', 'Barker', 'entire', 'movie', 'nonstop', 'laughs.Of', 'note', 'definitely', 'language/violence', 'movie', 'easily', 'offended', 'should', 'avoid', 'quot', 'Happy', 'Gilmore', 'quot', 'pretty', 'much', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'movie', 'general', 'fears', ""'m"", 'sure', 'disney', 'released', 'something', 'appropriately', 'fluffy', 'like', 'great', 'comedy', 'have', 'understanding', 'golf', 'sense', 'humor', 'matter', 'quot', 'Happy', 'Gilmore', 'quot', 'will', 'be', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'experience']",N/A

Then I saw this movie.  It is funnier then both of them.  The acting was incredible.  The  plot is incredible.  The humor is incredible.  Adam Sandler is a great  comedian.  He started out in the early 90s  on Saturday Night Live.  Now  he's doing movies.  I think his movies are much more hilarious then his  cds.  This movie shows that.  It is a great album with great acting, a  great plot, hilarious humor, and great directing.  If you want a movie to  buy, buy this one.  It's awesome, you won't regret it.
