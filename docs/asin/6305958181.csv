It's perfectly watchable and reasonably entertaining but descends into a silliness that results in a parody of itself. I wasn't quite sure what the point was of the entire film other than a possible message that violence is foolishness itself. Read the laudatory reviews and you'll realize they don't quite jive. People talk about two great warriors in this movie... really? When it came right down to it, the movie was mostly about some fun interesting non-sequitirs thrown into a movie that was simply about one thing - a young man saved by a soft hearted mobster becomes a hit man for the mobster and after being ordered to do a hit, the hit man is now being hunted down as a way to attach blame for the kiling to the hit man.

485025,A928WN8NV03WZ,6305958181,"A. M Robertson ""brother_entropy""","[6, 7]","This was another gem from the director Jim Jarmusch, who previously brought us the incredibly underrated zen spaghetti western Dead Man.  Which mixes some of the same elements, taking several genres, and blending them together in a believable and respectful way.Forest Whitaker is playing the main character.  A street punk who follows a bushido code and considers himself a modern day samurai.  He lives his life by this strict code of honor, and has pledged his life to a mobster who saved him.  So he works for this gangster as a contract killer.  Never questioning the reasons for his killings, just like a samurai, there is no good and evil.  You follow your the will of your master to the death.  Through all this you definitely get the feeling that he is alone in this world of his, duty is what concernes him.  His only friend is an ice cream vendor that doesn't speak english, just french, which Forest Whittaker's character doesn't.The second part of this film is the Mafia themself.  A comical group of broken down gangsters who are starting to show their age.  They are having trouble making their bills, and are suffering from internal conflicts.  Obviously their glory days are long gone, and they seem to be waiting for the inevitable.This movie blends to the two genres well, making them both entertaining and believable for the premise.  As we all know the Mafia lost most of it power through the late 70' to the mid 90's.  They show this with the age of the mobsters and the fact that they can't even make their bills.  The Bushido code wasn't practiced on a grand scale since World War 2 with the Japanese, when they lost the war, a lot of that part of their culture started to dissappear from their lives.  So you have two groups that were once held a great deal of power and respect, but now are a shadow of themeselves, being slowly forgotten.He also manages to make this as surreal as his previous pictures.  Not like the sledgehammer to head stylings of Greg Arraki, or force fed surrealism of David Lynch, but more subtle.  Lots of people watch cartoons, there are silent interludes where ambiant soundtracks play and you just feel the intensity of the main character, the world has a subdued and detached feel to it, like you are looking from the outside in, the philosophies still hold relavence today despite their age,......All in all it is a very good movie. Be warned it isn't an action movie, dont' expect any John Woo style gun fights or sword wielding killers, that isn't what this is about.  It is something deeper and more introspective.",5,Surreal and entertaining,1080518400,"03 29, 2004",2004,2573,"['was', 'gem', 'director', 'Jim', 'Jarmusch', 'who', 'previously', 'brought', 'incredibly', 'underrated', 'zen', 'spaghetti', 'western', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Which', 'mixes', 'same', 'elements', 'taking', 'several', 'genres', 'blending', 'together', 'believable', 'respectful', 'way.Forest', 'Whitaker', 'playing', 'main', 'character', 'A', 'street', 'punk', 'who', 'bushido', 'code', 'considers', 'modern', 'day', 'samurai', 'life', 'strict', 'code', 'honor', 'pledged', 'life', 'mobster', 'who', 'saved', 'gangster', 'contract', 'killer', 'Never', 'questioning', 'reasons', 'killings', 'just', 'samurai', 'good', 'evil', 'follow', 'will', 'master', 'death', 'definitely', 'get', 'feeling', 'alone', 'world', 'duty', 'what', 'only', 'friend', 'ice', 'cream', 'vendor', ""n't"", 'speak', 'english', 'just', 'french', 'Forest', 'Whittaker', 'character', ""doesn't.The"", 'second', 'part', 'film', 'Mafia', 'themself', 'comical', 'group', 'broken', 'down', 'gangsters', 'who', 'are', 'starting', 'show', 'age', 'are', 'having', 'trouble', 'making', 'bills', 'are', 'suffering', 'internal', 'conflicts', 'Obviously', 'glory', 'days', 'are', 'long', 'gone', 'seem', 'be', 'waiting', 'inevitable.This', 'movie', 'blends', 'two', 'genres', 'well', 'making', 'entertaining', 'believable', 'premise', 'know', 'Mafia', 'lost', 'most', 'power', 'late', '70', 'mid', '90', 'show', 'age', 'mobsters', 'fact', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'make', 'bills', 'Bushido', 'code', 'was', ""n't"", 'practiced', 'grand', 'scale', 'World', 'War', '2', 'Japanese', 'when', 'lost', 'war', 'lot', 'part', 'culture', 'started', 'dissappear', 'lives', 'have', 'two', 'groups', 'were', 'once', 'held', 'great', 'deal', 'power', 'respect', 'now', 'are', 'shadow', 'themeselves', 'being', 'slowly', 'forgotten.He', 'also', 'make', 'as', 'surreal', 'previous', 'pictures', 'Not', 'sledgehammer', 'head', 'stylings', 'Greg', 'Arraki', 'force', 'fed', 'surrealism', 'David', 'Lynch', 'more', 'subtle', 'Lots', 'people', 'watch', 'cartoons', 'are', 'silent', 'interludes', 'where', 'ambiant', 'soundtracks', 'play', 'just', 'feel', 'intensity', 'main', 'character', 'world', 'subdued', 'detached', 'feel', 'are', 'looking', 'outside', 'philosophies', 'still', 'hold', 'relavence', 'today', 'age', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'Be', 'warned', ""n't"", 'action', 'movie', 'dont', 'expect', 'John', 'Woo', 'style', 'gun', 'fights', 'sword', 'wielding', 'killers', ""n't"", 'what', 'about', 'something', 'deeper', 'more', 'introspective']",Ghost Dog - The Way of the Samurai VHS

(warning: possible spoilers)  He has sworn to serve the man who saved his life, who happens to be a member of a Mafia family.  The tone of the film is contemplative, scenes interspersed with readings from an ancient Samurai text.  I found the three characters who headed the Mafia family to be very entertaining in and of themselves.  The film is also laced with cartoons, which the Italian characters are watching. They are mostly violent chartoons, and provide an interesting comparison to the storyline.  The music was interesting and very well-matched to the film.

In the 'making of' featurette, Jarmusch remarks that he envisioned Forest Whitaker as Ghost Dog because Whitaker had the presence, authority and serenity (words to that effect) to pull it off (after all, Jarmusch is asking us to like and pull for a contract killer).  That choice seems prescient on Jarmusch's part - seven years after ""Ghost Dog,"" Whitaker's acting skills, wise role-picking and genial personality landed him at the top of the heap with his justly-rewarded portrayal of Idi Amin inThe Last King of Scotland (Widescreen Edition).Much of the tone of ""Ghost Dog"" is set by the score, drafted entirely by Wu-Tang Clan leader The RZA (who also makes a cameo appearance in the film - he's the guy in camouflage who greets Ghost Dog on the sidewalk towards the end).  RZA's presence isn't an afterthought - Jarmusch says he had in mind from the start a film with RZA as an equal collaborator.Isaach De Bankol&eacute; is a delightful presence as ice cream truck driver Raymond.

Italian mobsters have to be the most overdone movie theme I can think of other than action adventure itself as a category.  This film inhabits both of these sorely overdone worlds.

One of the problems Whittaker must face is that one of the mobsters is the man who saved his life some time ago.  He has worked for this man ever since as a paid assassin.

485035,A2NX99GVAX4TRP,6305958181,"Christopher J. Jarmick ""Word  Lover""","[11, 14]","If you think its virtually impossible to create an original film about a hired killer working for the mafia, you have not seen Ghost Dog: Way of the Samurai.  It's an imperfect film which will probably require about 20 minutes of patience before it absorbs you into its off-beat charms.  Sticking with Ghost Dog will reward you with a quirky, original, and at times very funny, dark comedy.  It's a film written and directed by indie film iconoclast Jim Jarmusch, and you'll find he remains very fond of fading out of scenes and creating interesting but not overly complicated visual motifs to play off of.  He of course finds some quirky characters and relationships to amuse us with-particularly a french speaking Haitian ice-cream vendor who speaks only a few English words, but is mostly perfectly understood by Forrest Whitakers' Ghost Dog.  Jarmusch also over-plays an interesting amusing idea (mobsters are always watching cartoons on t.v.) through repetition.Forest Whitaker plays Ghost Dog, a character who lives by a strict Samurai code and is ready to accept-even embrace death at any moment without fear.  Whitaker's sleepy eyes and demeanor always add warmth to any character he plays, but what's surprising is how (like Hong Kong's Sammo Hung) Whitaker despite his size is able to move with a ballet dancer's grace.  It's his balance, centeredness and grace that makes the outbreaks of violence somewhat surprising throughout the film.According to the samurai tradition, Ghost Dog has decided to live his life by, when a small time mobster (John Tormey) saves his life, Ghost Dog pledges utter loyalty to the mobster and is used as a contract killer by the mobster.  Ghost Dog only communicates with his mobster master through messages sent via the pigeons G.D. cares for.  The mobster contracts  Ghost Dog to wipe out a made mob guy  who's girlfriend is the mobster's boss' daughter.  The daughter is present when Ghost Dog kills her boyfriend. The mobster Ghost Dog kills is the uncle of another under-boss (Cliff Gorman) who demands from boss (Henry Silva) that his uncle's killer be eliminated.  Cliff Gorman really shines in his role as the under-boss who enjoys rapping to ten year old hip-hop hits by Public Enemy and Flavor Flav.  Ghost Dog has been such a loyal, efficient contract killer for Tormey however this creates a dilemma.  In one of the films' best scenes, Ghost Dog's master (Tormey) pleads for his servant's (Ghost Dog's) life and must try to explain the odd arrangements involving sending messages via Pigeon he has with the contract killer..  Tormey's mobster is told; &quot;Better Ghost Dog than you, right?&quot; and the simple plot of the film is set.  What happens is not always what you expect.  For instance, except for a couple of voice-over, Forest Whitaker doesn't speak any dialogue for the film's first forty-five minutes. He  is a loner who keeps almost entirely to himself but calls the French-speaking ice-cream  vendor (Isaach DeBankole) his best friend  and befriends a curious little girl (Camille Winbush) he meets in a local park.  At times the film erupts into brutal violence.I was reminded many times throughout the film of one of Jarmusch's idols, Sam Fuller (the great,under-appreciated director who's best films were in the late 50's/early 60's and include Pickup on South Street and Shock Corridor).  Fuller would also find fascinating, original and somewhat experimental ways to present rather familiar plot lines to his audience.There's also a reverance and appreciation of the contexts Jarmusch draws upon.  He does not do this in the somewhat plagiaristic fashion of a Tarantino (Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction specifically) but in a way that utilizes ideas in very diverse material (like Seijun Suzuki's 1967 film Branded to Kill, books like Ryunosuke Akutagawa's Rashomon and Other Stories,  Yamamoto Tsunetomo's Hagakure: The Book of the Samurai, and most surprisingly Mary Shelley's Frankenstein).  All of these are combined with GoodFellas set in urban setting with a hip-hop soundtrack by Wu Tang Clan's  RZA.Hagakure in fact serves as  Ghost Dog's bible and is quoted (in English) with quiet voice-overs and inter-titles 13 times throughout the film.  It's a risky thing for a film to include it's own annotated footnotes, but Jarmusch pulls it off.The balancing act only fails when it turns in on itself and concludes in a classic Western showdown.  Even so, it's not an unsatisfying compromise, but a willingness of Jarmusch to submit to audience expectations and keep things within a defined conventional narrative.If you're looking for an original, but still entertaining crime thriller, Ghost Dog should more than satisfy.Chris Jarmick Author of The Glass Cocoon  with Serena F.

485038,A39CX0EE4BZCZC,6305958181,Craig Connell,"[4, 5]","This is one of the strangest, and most likable movies I have ever seen....and I have seen a lot, believe me. Scene after scene was bizarre. I watched an amazement on the first viewing, chuckling here and there. By the third viewing, I just laughing out loud throughout much of it. The dark, subtle humor in here is as good as I've ever seen on film....even though it may be classified more of a gangster film than a comedy.The humor mainly involved the gangsters, who were a bunch of old Mafia men. A mob never looked this pathetic but they were characters. It was especially fun to see Henry Silva again, a man who used to be an effective villain back on a lot of TV shows in the 1960s. He didn't say much in this movie but the looks on his face were priceless. The funniest guy, at least to me, was the mobster who sang and danced to rap music!The byplay between ""Ghost Dog,"" the hero of the movie played wonderfully by Forest Whitaker, and the ice cream man, who only spoke French, also was fun and entertaining. Almost every character in here was a strange, led by Whitaker who plays a modern-day hit-man who lives by the code of the ancient Samurai warriors. He also trains and communicates through carrier pigeons. Hey, I said this was a bizarre movie!The violence was no-nonsense, however, nothing played for laughs and unlike Rambo-mentality, people who were shot at were hit and usually killed right away.Along the way on this strange tale was a lesson or two on loyalty, racism, philosophies, kindness, communication, etc. How much of this you take seriously, and how much as a gag, is up to you, I guess. The more I watch this, the more I see it as clever put-on comedy....yet sad. It's not to easy to describe but you wind up getting involved with these odd people.The movie changes rapidly as Whitaker does in this story. One minute he is a brutally bear-like hit-man and the next minute, the gentlest ofsouls.A very unique film.

485039,AUHG8KSHI529U,6305958181,Craig Matteson,"[3, 6]","I always find Forest Whitaker engaging.  There is a pathos behind his characterizations that draws me in, no matter who the character is or what good or horrible things they are engaged in.  In this movie, he plays a man who, in flashback, was rescued as a boy by a Mafioso with a kindly streak.  Since that time he has felt a loyalty to Louie (played well by John Tormey).  This boy worked and studied hard and turned himself into a very skilled and professional murderer (hit man).  He lives totally alone, except for the carrier pigeons he raises and uses to communicate with Louie.  Whitaker's character has taken the name Ghost Dog and is known and respected in the neighborhood (ghetto).He reads in the park and develops a small conversational relationship with a little girl named Pearline (played by the engaging Camille Winbush - whom you may know as `Nessa on the Bernie Mac Show).  His best friend is a man who sells ice cream from a van who speaks only French and understands no English.  Ghost Dog never knows what he is saying, but we do because of the subtitles.  We see that they pretty much know each other very well, even without actual conversation.  It is a very light a nice touch for a film that could have been quite dark and heavy.The story involves a hit that Ghost Dog is hired to make.  He doesn't know that the person he is killing is a made mobster who has made the local family's boss quite angry.  Even though Ghost Dog does exactly what he is required to do, someone has to take the fall for killing a made guy.  Guess who?  Louie?This mob family is quite a hoot.  They are on such hard times that they are behind on the rent for the place they use for their hangout.  The big boss even has his estate for sale.Roger Ebert says that he got a better feel for the movie when he watched it with the view that Ghost Dog is insane.  After all, offering this loyalty to Louie when it is clearly not reciprocated and living by a code that only he has is not really rational.  I think Ebert has a point.It is not a particularly bloody movie, but the language is harsh and the subject matter is murder.  Still, it has some very comical moments and memorable characters.

While films like the  Corrupter and Romeo Must Die were good attempts I feel neither did the  subject justice.  In the case of those films looking at Chinese  culture.Ghost Dog successfully does this with Japanese culture.  Taking  Japanese feudalism, Zen Buddhism and applying it to a modern day inner city  hitman who works and then takes on the mob.In Japanese feudal society  the Emperor was a figure head to the Shogun who really ran the show.  Under  the Shogun were Daimyo (Lords) who were the landowners.  Under the Daimyo  were the Samurai.  The Samurai were loyal to their respective Daimyo.  Samurai would rather face death or commit ritual suicide (seppuku) rather  than fail or betray their daimyo.  Samurai without Daimyo were looked down  upon.  These Samurai were Ronin.Ghost Dog deals with all of the above  and applies it to the story of a hitman (Samurai) looking out for his boss  (Daimyo).  Interjected within the story are actual quotes from Japanese  writings on the role of the Samurai.The film is slow at times.  It is a  very well done film.  The acting is great.  The music is perfect.  But it  is slow at times and that can make it tough to watch in spots.  But other  than some of the pacing its a brilliant movie.The DVD has some cool  extra stuff.  The film is definetly worth watching.  The music is great and  the DVD does have good stuff in addition to the film.  But because the film  is slow at times, I do not know if its the type of film you will watch over  and over again.  Therefore, I can't recommend buying it.

485041,A1FDV3WPOHREY9,6305958181,"C. Scanlon ""least helpful reviewer""","[3, 4]","Okay, so the end is like really very weak. The Haitian would have intervened much earlier and more effectively to protect his friend, unless he loved him enough to let him go along his death march as the final solution. The little girl's mom NEVER would have let her go get ice cream with this known psycho killer, let alone go to the scene of that final showdown and draw a gun on the last old guy standing. And the bell tower in that showdown was ENOUGH of a tip off for an ultimately meaningless reference to High Noon; we don't need to hear the title High Noon directly spoken, nor do we need Ghost Dog's suddenly loquacious commentary ""Very dramatic"" repeatedly.Okay? But we still have not hit a critical mass of flaws permitting us to hate this movie.Okay during one night walk scene (not the first one which is EXCELLENT but later) we see the portable lights walking along with the stand in for Forest Whitaker. Okay, so the scene where the mobsters are gathered in the back of the restaurant for the first discussion about Ghost Dog, like, the editor lost interest or focus or whatever and ran to showing us dopey reaction shots instead of the one interesting character, who was speaking and performing broadly for the camera in a very entertaining style. Hey, someties I LIKE to be entertained and this guy, the skinny guy who likes Flava FLav and walks with a limp, was the best thing in the whole darned movie. So why cut away during his best lines and show us the potato face of Ghost Dog's contact? Why?Still we have not amassed a critical mass which permits us to hate this movie.This is a great movie. This is the first movie I have ever seen inwhich the real hero, protagonist and driving force is a book.The best and most permanently valuable scenes from this movie simply present Ghost Dog reading to us from the book, and showing us the page. The selections from that very long classical writing are excellent, well-chosen and very instructive for life. Remember them well. They were enough to get me to buy the book as well, but it is just not the same without Ghost Dog reading them. I especially like (well, I really like each and every reading but this one too) when he reads that when we are solid in our own Way we can hear of other ways and advance on our own Way. And so I could learn from this way, of the warrior, a way I would never walk. Thou shalt not kill, baby!It is wonderful to see so many people engrossed in reading, inspired by reading, not only Ghost Dog but also the head mobster's daughter and the little girl who fills were lunch box with good and nutritious books. And the book they all share is Rashomon (which is actually a different story from the one used to film the film of the same title, which used a story by the same author but of a different name).Yet I cannot get past the lesson that killing is okay, even under the tightly restrictive code observed. Yet the most memorable character, the old flunky pigeon catcher whose role only shines in death (dutring which time he practices equal opportunity in shooting a traffic cop) as he has the greatest (and nearly his only) line, that Ghost Dog did them a great favor in letting them go out as real gangsters, instead of just fadig away as fat and unhappy old men. I believe that this, once again way too explicitly stated but necessary for today's American audience that needs to get knocked over the head, is the real lesson of Ghost Dog, on a mission of love for these old men, one of whom once saved his life, now all failing in their business and in life, faced only with the daily unhappy memory of those they have killed and damaged, watching the money dry up leaving them with nothing, that Ghost Dog did them the dignity to let them go out swiftly as they lived, rather than melting slowly away in some rest home full of tubes inside every orifice.THis is really a very challenging film, with food for thought, not only in the readings, but in the ethical quesitons which it poses regarding death and dying. Was Ghost Dog's practice of euthanasia ethical? Was his shooting of those hunters who had killed a sacred black bear?Many incredible shots in this film, including the opening flight over MAnhattan from the pigeon's POV, Ghost Dog's first night walk through the city streets in which no one seems to notice him (hey, like, he's a GHOST, all right? we get it!) as the bars close, his drives through the city, thast music (which could have been more carefully captioned, even I can make out the missing words!), etc. I used to drive those same streets, including the road into upstate and it brings back much nostalgia and homesickness now five years since I have seen them.I love this movie very much. I gave my copy away to a very close friend, who cannot find it (yeah, yeah, right) but I am proud to purchase another one here upon the amazon.Forgive me, please, but I cannot find that the obvious errors in this movie, of which there are several more (it could have used at least one more re-write), do not form a critical mass outweighing the rough-cut and valuable jewel which it truly is. A further indication of its continued value and interest is that it still receives a review a month five years after its release.Kids, get a good book and read, like the Dog. But hey, now, put down that gun. Put that thing away before somebody gets hurt or you get sent to jail or overseas. Read a book instead. A good one. A book to live by.

But having seen Melville's film Le Samourai, I can now explain Ghost Dog.  Le Samourai is a non-sequitur in which the title of the film has essentially nothing to do with the plot (assassination) or theme (solitude) of the film.  Ghost Dog is an homage re-make of Le Samourai that says ""let's try to make the title relate to the plot.""  It's that simple, and that's why the film fails.  The idea of a overweight, out of shape inner-city contract killer who derives some lifestyle from reading Hagakure and swinging around a samurai sword is ridiculous and not even clever or fun if you actually know anything about Japanese history, martial arts culture, or, especially, the actual contents of Hagakure.

He plays it perfectly with just the right amount of understatement, making him a very compelling character.  Jamursch is great in the way he differs from the norm, he obviously tries to make the world ghost dog lives in a little different from the world we live in, but not so much that we feel a sense of detachment from it.  The style in this movie is great, everything has a dream like quality, which doesn't detract from the characters or the story.  The pace of the movie is slow, but never boring, ghost dog is just such a great character, that I never got tired of watching him.  The action scenes in this movie are very different from typical fare, they are subdued, with no obscene wire work or ridiculous gun play.  They fit the pace and style of the movie perfectly.

Like Tom Waitts' gravely voice that should have made him a failure rather than a succes as performer and song writer (often writing for Jarmusch's films) this movie is logical in a progression of Jarmusch's films.Beginning with casting Forest Whitaker as the inner city Samurai, , who doesn't exactly sport a Bruce Lee physique, OBVIOUSLY this movie was never meant to be taken literally! In fact, Jarmusch may be the ONLY director who dares, and can pull off, a film that mixes hip-hop street culture with Mafioso wise guys, sprinkle it with quotes from The Book of the Samurai by Hagakure and not just ""get away with it"" but make it all work!If you like Jim Jarmusch films then you'll love GHOST DOG. If you've never seen one of his flicks then go easy on yourself ... and take a peek at his 1991 film, NIGHT ON EARTH. If nothing else, you'll have a chance to see Winona Ryder in a wonderful acting role before she became, err, Winona Ryder. And let's not forget the other greats such as Gena Rowlands, B&eacute;atrice Dalle, Armin Mueller-Stahl, and that terrific MOUTH (and body) Rosie Perez who made NIGHT ON EARTH what it is. How can you resist?In GHOST DOG, Whittaker is a gentle pigeon raising philosopher who is repected and feared in his 'hood. By night, he does ""special"" hits for the Mafia because as any good Samurai, he is loyal to one of the aging lieutenants who saved his life when Whittaker was a youth. The man he does contracts for is more like a character out of the ANALYZE THIS! than from the GODFATHER The wise guys in GHOST DOG are a bunch of ignorant bumblers (one of them played by Victor Argo, a great character actor) who can occasionally become very dangerous. Mixed in with this stew is a little black girl who Whittaker befiends because the two of them share a love of books.Whittaker character's best friend is an ice cream vendor who doesn't speak a word of English, having just recently arrived from Ivory Coast in Africa. Some of the best dialogue is between these two who are so intuitively tuned to one another that although their words don't ever match up in their bilingual ""conversations"" they can exactly guess what the other one means.Anyhow, this end-of-the-millennium film spiritually spans centuries while its post modern style was just born yesterday.

Now not any longer, after watching a few of his very special gems.Ghost Dog, in summary, sounds like a standard action or mob film. The title hero, Whitaker, is a black hit man in New York, working for the mob with a special personal bond of loyalty to one the mobsters, not the top guy. He gets entangled in a complicated farce of an honor issue of the senile and ridiculous gangsters that dominate the film. The top mobster, a ghost- like Henry Silva, decides that the hitman must be killed.Ghost Dog has self-styled himself as a samurai, and he follows the code as he sees it from a book that he reads on his roof, where lives with his carrier pigeons. He fights back with restraints of loyalty.Those who take the film as a normal action film will be disappointed. It is an absurd farce on the genre, with great dialogues and cinematography.

True, there are similarities.  Both Terry Malloy and Ghost Dog are more connected to children and pigeons than they are to the adult world - but the former is so because he remains a childlike and illiterate palooka whilst the latter actually reads, takes children seriously, and communicates more on a ""spiritual"" or emotional level than he does on a verbal level.  Apart from his pigeons, Ghost Dog (played by Forest Whitaker) connects or communicates best with a young girl with whom he discusses literature - including Rashomon, Frankenstein and Wind in the Willows - an ice cream vendor who only speaks French, a silent dog of the street, and intermittently with street rappers en passant. It is these elements too which remain central to the film, rather than the comical mobsters, who fumble and bumble their way through life and for recreation spend their time watching Felix Cartoons circa 1935.  It is quite refreshing to see gangsters or mobsters treated like this instead of romanticised as they usually are in such iconic works as THE GODFATHER trilogy and THE SOPRANOS.  Lets face it, there are similarities between ""the captains of industry"" and the so called mob in Western society - the means they use may differ but their purpose and intent may remain the same.A marxist interpretation of this work is entirely plausible.  Equally, Hasidic Jews of Brooklyn would relate to it and understand its themes whilst deploring its violence.  Nevertheless, it seems to me one major theme is that of the Artist in a hostile and materialistic landscape attempting to survive. And surviving means self discipline, being true to one's beliefs, treating small things with great importance (his ice cream eating is undertaken with a reverence similar to a Japanese tea ceremony) and treating large things lightly (death is treated lightly).But, the film is rich enough for the viewer to bring to it his or her own experience and enjoy on many levels.Mr Whitaker holds the centre of the film with consummate skill - to me it's some of his best work. (To upstage Paul Newman as the laboratory experiment pool player in The Color of Money was pretty darn good too!)Robbie Muller manages to capture the mood with his POV photography through the eyes of a pigeon - or God -and the feel of urban life.

Even though he is a killer, he looks at life in a differant way.  Everything is meant to be in his life, which he seems to believe follows fate.  The various mobsters are hilarious sendups of the very serious characters that have been created in Scorcese films and the Sopranos.  Sonny Valerio, who loves the old school rapper Flava Flav is quite honestly one of the funniest characters in any film this year.Jarmusch has always been big on style and intelligence, and this film does not lack in either of the categories.  His camera is graceful and deliberate and the pure genius that went into the script is incomperable.  Everything in this movie, from the action scenes to the various interludes involving making silencers and electronic equipment used to break into cars is very, very smart.  Even the parts of the film that deal with the importance and beauty of animals and nature are stunning and terrific.  It's a wonder that Jarmusch hasn't been swallowed up by Hollywood yet.I cannot recommend this film more, but, like many of my fellow reviewers have said, many viewers will not like this film.  It doesn't appeal to everyone and that is truly a shame.  The story will not relate to many people, and that is bad for this movie.

485070,A202IBIG7TYKRD,6305958181,jmk444,"[1, 2]","Jim Jarmusch's Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai is a fascinating flick - an odd hybrid, two parts gangster epic, one part philosophical journey of self-discovery. Forrest Whitaker (Phenomenon, Good Morning Vietnam) is Ghost Dog, a loner, who considers himself a ""retainer"" (servant/protector) to a mobster named Lou (John Tormey) who once saved his life.Ghost Dog is a seeker, studying the Hagakure (The Code of the Samurai). Throughout the film, he reads passages from the Hagakure that highlight his own personal code. Passages like, ""Each day a samurai should contemplate his own death and consider various ways of dying, from being torn apart in the jaws of a wild beast, to falling from thousand foot cliffs, and during some part of the day, the samurai should consider himself dead.""Ghost Dog's ""best friend"" is a Haitian ice cream vendor (Isaac DeBankole), despite the fact that Whitaker's character understands no French and the ice cream vendor doesn't understand English. His only other real human contact is with a young girl, maybe 10 years old, named Pearline (Camille Winbush).Lou contacts Ghost Dog via carrier pigeon and pays him for his contract killings once a year...Lou doesn't know anything else about his contract killer, not his given name, not even where he lives. This becomes the fulcrum for some very dark comedy.When a hit goes awry and Lou's associates look to eliminate Ghost Dog, Lou's inability to provide details makes for some darkly comedic confrontations. Veteran screen villain Henry Silva is cold and bizarre as mob boss Ray Vargo, while Cliff Gorman (Sonny Valerio) provides a comic absurdity (a mafia hit man who's also a rap aficionado) rivaled only by the communication between Ghost Dog and the ice cream vendor that transcends language.Much of the background score is provided by the Staten Island based rap group, Wu Tang Clan, which gives it a real gritty, streety feel. Much of the film moves at a crawl and you get the impression that Forrest Whitaker wanted to state something more, that just doesn't translate onto film.The story is dark and in spots absurdly ridiculous (the mobsters all seem obsessed with old cartoons), but it doesn't glorify violence the way many gangster flicks do. Still, it leaves you looking for more.I've thought about this and part of it may be that Ghost Dog seems to be a reluctant hero in much the same vein as Brandon Lee's The Crow or Sam Rami's Darkman, but seems to fall a little short, but that may be an illusion. Both Darkman and The Crow are offered up as supernatural creatures (The Crow returns from the dead for vengeance and Darkman is supposedly bestowed with an almost infinite pain threshold due to nerve damage), while Ghost Dog is a living, bleeding, loner, so he can't be compared to those kind of protagonists.The ending of this film, like that of Shyamalan's Unbreakable will probably leave many westerners cold. Here it seems almost taboo when good fails to triumph outright over evil.I liked this film, even though I felt it reached for more than it could deliver, just as I liked Unbreakable (that may give you a clue as to whether this is your kind of film), but I'd recommend it with four stars out of five. If it had delivered all that it reached for, it would've been a sure fire five!",4,Modern Mobster...Samurai,1017878400,"04 4, 2002",2002,3293,"['Jim', 'Jarmusch', 'Ghost', 'Dog', 'Way', 'Samurai', 'fascinating', 'flick', 'odd', 'hybrid', 'two', 'parts', 'gangster', 'epic', 'one', 'part', 'philosophical', 'journey', 'self-discovery', 'Forrest', 'Whitaker', 'Phenomenon', 'Good', 'Morning', 'Vietnam', 'Ghost', 'Dog', 'loner', 'who', 'retainer', 'servant/protector', 'mobster', 'named', 'Lou', 'John', 'Tormey', 'who', 'once', 'saved', 'life.Ghost', 'Dog', 'seeker', 'studying', 'Hagakure', 'Code', 'Samurai', 'film', 'passages', 'Hagakure', 'highlight', 'own', 'personal', 'code', 'Passages', 'day', 'samurai', 'should', 'contemplate', 'own', 'death', 'consider', 'various', 'ways', 'dying', 'being', 'torn', 'apart', 'jaws', 'wild', 'beast', 'falling', 'thousand', 'foot', 'cliffs', 'part', 'day', 'samurai', 'should', 'consider', 'dead', 'Ghost', 'Dog', 'best', 'friend', 'Haitian', 'ice', 'cream', 'vendor', 'Isaac', 'DeBankole', 'fact', 'Whitaker', 'character', 'French', 'ice', 'cream', 'vendor', ""n't"", 'understand', 'English', 'only', 'other', 'real', 'human', 'contact', 'young', 'girl', 'maybe', '10', 'years', 'old', 'named', 'Pearline', 'Camille', 'Winbush', 'contacts', 'Ghost', 'Dog', 'carrier', 'pigeon', 'contract', 'killings', 'once', 'year', 'Lou', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'else', 'contract', 'killer', 'not', 'given', 'name', 'not', 'even', 'where', 'fulcrum', 'very', 'dark', 'comedy.When', 'hit', 'awry', 'Lou', 'associates', 'look', 'eliminate', 'Ghost', 'Dog', 'Lou', 'inability', 'provide', 'details', 'darkly', 'comedic', 'confrontations', 'Veteran', 'screen', 'villain', 'Henry', 'Silva', 'cold', 'bizarre', 'mob', 'Ray', 'Vargo', 'Cliff', 'Gorman', 'Sonny', 'Valerio', 'comic', 'absurdity', 'mafia', 'hit', 'man', 'who', 'also', 'rap', 'aficionado', 'rivaled', 'only', 'communication', 'Ghost', 'Dog', 'ice', 'cream', 'vendor', 'language.Much', 'background', 'score', 'provided', 'Staten', 'Island', 'based', 'rap', 'group', 'Wu', 'Tang', 'Clan', 'real', 'gritty', 'streety', 'feel', 'Much', 'film', 'moves', 'crawl', 'get', 'impression', 'Forrest', 'Whitaker', 'wanted', 'state', 'something', 'more', 'just', ""n't"", 'translate', 'film.The', 'story', 'dark', 'spots', 'absurdly', 'ridiculous', 'mobsters', 'seem', 'obsessed', 'old', 'cartoons', ""n't"", 'glorify', 'violence', 'way', 'many', 'gangster', 'flicks', 'do', 'Still', 'looking', 'more.I', ""'ve"", 'thought', 'part', 'may', 'be', 'Ghost', 'Dog', 'be', 'reluctant', 'hero', 'much', 'same', 'vein', 'Brandon', 'Lee', 'Crow', 'Sam', 'Rami', 'Darkman', 'fall', 'little', 'short', 'may', 'be', 'illusion', 'Darkman', 'Crow', 'are', 'offered', 'up', 'supernatural', 'creatures', 'Crow', 'returns', 'dead', 'vengeance', 'Darkman', 'supposedly', 'bestowed', 'almost', 'infinite', 'pain', 'threshold', 'due', 'nerve', 'damage', 'Ghost', 'Dog', 'living', 'bleeding', 'loner', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'compared', 'kind', 'protagonists.The', 'ending', 'film', 'Shyamalan', 'Unbreakable', 'will', 'probably', 'leave', 'many', 'westerners', 'cold', 'Here', 'almost', 'taboo', 'when', 'good', 'fails', 'triumph', 'outright', 'evil.I', 'liked', 'film', 'even', 'felt', 'reached', 'more', 'could', 'deliver', 'just', 'liked', 'Unbreakable', 'may', 'give', 'clue', 'kind', 'film', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'four', 'stars', 'five', 'had', 'delivered', 'reached', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'sure', 'fire', 'five']",Ghost Dog - The Way of the Samurai VHS

Strangely  enough, though, now that I've seen it I actually think that would have  worked if the movie didn't have so many ridiculous little moments that  simply don't make sense and cannot be taken seriously.  Take the little  blinking device Ghost Dog uses to steal cars.  Is it magic?  It certainly  seems so, since that little gizmo can apparently do anything Ghost Dog  needs for whatever situation he's in.  Or the scene where Ghost Dog  practices with his sword on the roof-- why show him practicing with it if  he never uses it and we never see it again?  Or showing him twirl his  silencer gun like a sword whenever shoots someone (my friends and I were  laughing uncontrollably every time this happened)?  But worst of all is the  moment when our big, fat samurai hero kills a mobster by shooting him up  through the drain of a bathroom faucet.  It's like a &quot;Find everything  preposterous and unbelievable about this scene&quot; exercise for film  students.  I also think everything really should have ended with the  shootout at the big mansion, and the &quot;bear hunter&quot; scene should  have been the last one, going straight to the credits when Ghost Dog points  his gun at the screen and fires.  But no, it drags on for another barely  watchable half hour.  I really don't know why this film has generated such  a favorable following, and it certainly hasn't made me want to see any of  Jim Jarmusch's other films.

Ghost Dog (Forest Whitaker) is a silent modern-day warrior who lives on a rooftop shack. He spends his days breeding pigeons and playing chess in the park with his best friend, Raymond (Isaach de Bankol&eacute;), a French-speaking ice-cream man. At night he goes to work as a hit man, performing his tasks stealthily and invisibly, abiding by the codes established by HAGAKURE: THE BOOK OF THE SAMURAI, an 18th-century text.One night, while on his latest hit, Ghost Dog encounters a mob boss's beautiful daughter, Louise (Tricia Vessey). Although Ghost Dog leaves her unharmed, her father nonetheless orders Ghost Dog's execution, to the dismay of Louie (John Tormey), his loyal retainer. As the mobsters struggle to locate the mysteriously untraceable Ghost Dog, he must find a way to protect himself while remaining loyal to Louie and the ancient codes that define him as an individual. Jarmusch successfully tackles a variety of genres with GHOST DOG, including mob movies and spiritual samurai films.

The film is based  on the story of an ancient Japan obsessed Samurai Type hitmen who chooses  to live his life under the guidance of &quot;Hagakure&quot; The book of  Samurai. Forrest Whitaker really portrays an anti hero who lives the life  of a long forgotten group of brave and noble as well as hardened and  fanatical band of Japanese warriors,in some fantastical acting. He basicly  proves that when given a chance he is able to portray his acting abilities  in full.  In a society where everything seems to be going downhill, Ghost  Dog lives his life devoted totally to a mafioso who saved his life years  ago. Jarmusch uses pages of Hagakure to help out the viewer throghout the  film in order to make Ghost Dog's actions more acceptable but If you really  want to get the deeper meaning of the messages it is better to have a go on  the Hagakure itself which is amazingly holding an alternative way of living  to our modern society and way of life in many ways.  Jarmusch has brilliant  ideas as always with birds,jokes about mafia (especially the &quot;they  wanted equality and got it now&quot; bit) and musical structure which is  placed when Ghost Dog drives stolen cars. Story is quite satisfactory with  many interesting characters like french speaking ice cream seller and  insane daughter of mafioso etc.But the character Ghost Dog is the  unforgettable one who will sure influence many viewers in one way or  another after watching the film. I personally enjoyed this film very much  and like evry other Jarmusch film the viewer is not required to be an  intellectual or a pretentious art house freak. Story is pure and simple for  everyone but If you want more complexity and psychoanalytical stuff, there  are many treasures buried to be find out by the spectator.

485084,A2NJO6YE954DBH,6305958181,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[26, 30]","I do not expect most people to like &quot;Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai&quot; as much as I did because I do not think most viewers are going to be as willing to accept the black comedy aspects along with the philosophical musings and sporadic blood shed. In fact, I think a lot of people will find the mixture rather strange, but at least compelling if not outright provocative. Writer-director Jim Jarmusch is able to pull this off because he has Forest Whitaker in the title role and when he admits on one of the special features that he would have abandoned the project if Whitaker had passed on &quot;Ghost Dog&quot; you know he is absolutely right.You willingness to take this film on at face value is tested by the premise. Once upon a time a mid-level Mafiaso named Louie (John Tormey) came upon a couple of guys beating the crap out of a young black man (Damon Whitaker). When the guys take exception to Louie's interruption, he blows them away. We are told that some time later the young black man comes to Louie and declares himself to be in debt; calling himself Ghost Dog, he becomes a contract killer for Louie, although he calls himself a loyal retainer. Ghost Dog follows the way of the samurai, which is laid out in the book &quot;Hagakure: The Way of the Samurai.&quot; But where the book enters the picture is unclear. If he was reading it before the assault then he should have been able to disptach those two guys; he certainly does well against everybody else in this film. But perhaps it was afterwards.The key thing to understand is that Ghost Dog is a Don Quixote figure, both in terms of following a creed long forgotten by the world in which he lives but also because he is certifiably crazy. Ghost Dog is living by a rules that Louie does not even know about, let along understand. Yet this does not bother Ghost Dog any more than the fact that he only speaks English and his best friend, Haitian ice cream vendor Raymond (Isaach De Bankol&eacute;) only speaks French. The major conceit of this film are the quotation from &quot;Hagakure&quot; recited by Ghost Dog (e.g., &quot;Even if one's head were to be suddenly cut off, he should be able to do one more action with certainty&quot;), which present the philosophy of the Samurai and serve to explain his motivations.The problem comes when Ghost Dog does a successful hit on a mobster only to discover that Louise Vargo (Tricia Vessey), daughter of the big boss, Ray Vargo (Henry Siliva), is on the scene. She was not supposed to be there, but she was. Ghost Dog has no instructions about killing anybody else and Louise is reading &quot;Rashomon,&quot; so he leaves her alone (but borrows the book). However, despite the fact he is a successful contract killer, Vargo wants Ghost Dog killed. In one of the most surreal exposition scenes of all-time, Louie has to explain to Vargo, underboss Sonny Valerio (Cliff Gorman) and a senile Old Consigliere (Gene Ruffini) that he contacts Ghost Dog by carrier pigeon, trying to explain to the old school mafiaoses the bizarre relationship.For Vargo it comes down to Ghost Dog or Louie, and since Ghost Dog has objections to it being either himself or his &quot;master,&quot; he takes matters into his own hands. This guy might practice with a sword, but he is pretty good with a gun as well. Meanwhile, Ghost Dog has befriended a young girl, Pearline (Camille Winbush), trying to pass on something of the life he has lived and what he believes. There might be some message here about two outdated modes of thinking, that of the Samurai verus that of the Mafia, but ultimately this film is about Whitaker's character and his performance. Whatever problems there are with the storyline or the clash of disparate elements in the film are forgiven by what Whitaker does as he goes back and forth between living a life of meditation and being an efficient killing machine.

485085,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,6305958181,Lee Armstrong,"[1, 2]","Forrest Whittaker is certainly one of our most talented and underrated actors.  This role probably allows him the greatest latitude to express a wide range of emotions since he starred as Charlie Parker in Clint Eastwood's ""Bird"" or in the gender-bender ""The Crying Game.""  As Ghost Dog, he winds his way through Jim Jarmusch's script with grace & depth.In adopting the way of the Samurai, GDog latches onto Louie, a mid-level mob boss played by John Tormey.  The mix of cultures is a familiar Jarmusch theme that is exceptionally well realized in this DVD.  One of the most interesting aspects of the film is GDog's relationship to his French-speaking best friend Raymond.  The two often converse, not understanding each other's language but almost mirroring each other's thoughts as the subtitled French indicates.  Isaach de Bankole does a great job as the ice cream truck-driving friend.  Also very pivotal to the film is the wonderful screen time given to Camille Winbush as Pearline, a child who GDog loans a copy of Rashamon to.  There is a great rapport between the two.The Italian crime bosses are ironically played for laughs with Cliff Gorman's inept mob boss front & center.  As Vargo, Henry Silva who has such a great ethnic look and has played in ""Dick Tracy"" & ""Oceans 11"" does a great job of being hard-edged and incompetent.  His daughter Louise is a witness to one of GDog's early executions and eventually orders Louie to perform the hit on our star.With the aspects of carrier pigeons and a guy building an arc on a city rooftop, we see numerous interesting cultural aspects and humor combined in the drama.  This is an interesting film melding Asian culture with modern crime, kind of a Hip-Hop version of Kung Fu.  Whittaker keeps us glued to the screen for a most interesting performance.

The script is almost entirely dialouge you will want to quote.  Forest Whitaker plays Ghost Dog, a black hit man who works for a small time mobster named Louie in New Jersey (although New Jersey is never named, you can just tell it is Jersey).  Louie and his aging mobster pals strut around like old roosters in the barnyard.  Ghost Dog could have been called ""Ghost Bird"" because of his affinity for feathered creatures.  His only friends are his tame pigeons, an ice cream man who only speaks French (yet the two understand each other perfectly), and later in the film, a little girl who carries her books in a lunchbox.The film is two hours, and moves at a SLOW pace.  Despite the theme of ""samurai,"" there is no fast-paced martial arts or sword-wielding.  Ghost Dog uses his guns in place of swords.  Ghost Dog never moves past ""amble"" mode throughout the film.  But the screenplay is so good it is worth sitting through it.  The scenes of the lonely Jersey streets at night and the voiceovers (with print) of genuine Zen quotes from an ancient samurai master really touch a part of your soul you have long forgotten or didn't know existed.The film could be misinterpreted as condoning gang warfare.

By being hypnotic and visually beautiful, at least according to the rules of the eccentric filmmaking world of director Jim Jarmusch. This is a world of contradictions and ironies where a black man can be a hit man for a seedy Mafioso gang by convincing himself that he is a samurai warrior. While this setup allows for a great deal of incisive dark humor, it also creates a sense of profound sadness. At some points, I didn't know whether to laugh or cry.Ghost Dog is played by Forest Whitaker. I have been a fan of his since ""The Crying Game"", and I think this is his finest performance to date. He creates an indelible character. What makes this all the more remarkable is that, except for the passages he recites from a samurai handbook, he has very little dialog. He conveys nearly everything through his body language.When his life is saved by an old Mafia guy, Ghost Dog decides the man is his samurai master. That's why he volunteers to be a hit man. When a hit goes wrong, the local Don decides that Ghost Dog must die. This proves to be far easier said than done. How do you even find a man who doesn't own a phone and communicates solely through carrier pigeons?This is an unusual movie that I found to be fascinating. Though there may be some deep hidden meaning to its story, I saw it as a brilliant satire of the crime genre.

Do they always mix and match tone and theme, creating strange and wondrous (and confusing) dichotomies?  Is sadness always so easily mixed with silly laughter?  If so, I think I'll take more walks down Jarmusch Way, for &quot;Ghost Dog&quot;, despite some oddball flaws, sure had me entertained.Its basic conceit is this: in the modern, urban world, one must follow the tenets of the samurai in order to survive, and thrive.  It's the only way to kill or be killed, without bringing pain upon oneself.  I thought that Jarmusch missed the boat in terms of allowing this idea to prosper.  Even though he liberally quotes from the Hagakure (&quot;The Book of the Samurai&quot;) before every scene, most of the tenets it espouses appear to be mere fashion tips, i.e., how to look like a bad mutha when walking through the neighbourhood.  That being said, Jarmusch does succeed in allowing the Hagakure's ideas to prosper in the choice and direction of his lead actorForest Whitaker is successful in his portrayal of Ghost Dog.  He moves slowly.  His lazy left eye, usually a distraction, is used to great effect here, showing his relaxed, Zen nature.  And when practicing his sword work on the rooftops of New York, Whitaker, a beefy man, moves with the grace and agility of a cat.  My favourite part of his work, the physicality of which was stunning, was how he'd re-holster his guns: he'd swirl them around as if they were samurai swords looking for a sheath.Except for some laid-back narration, the role is nearly silent.  Whitaker plays this silence well, allowing his expressions or his body language to tell a further story.  When he does interact with people, the results can be hit or miss, but it's always unusual.  His best friend, a Haitian ice cream man, speaks only French (usually through a megaphone).  But the two men appear able to communicate with each other perfectly, without even knowing that they are.  These scenes provide a light touch that became tiresome after awhile, but still provided the film with some fine comic moments.  Other scenes, involving a curious little girl, allow Whitaker to show Ghost Dog's tender side.  Their scenes together are touching.  It's a typical Beauty and the Beast scenario, where she is able to cut through his gruff veneer to the gentleness that lives beneath.  And Ghost Dog's moments with Louie, a mobster who once saved his life and who now employs him as a hit man (a relationship that sets up the movie's narrative thrust, if a movie like this can be said to have a narrative thrust), go well beyond the you-saved-me-so-now-I'm-in-your-debt cliches, to create something truly ridiculous.Louie is a man of tremendous ennui, who can barely muster the energy to react to horrific situations anymore (it's actually funny to see how quickly he becomes resigned to his fate, when a hit goes wrong and his bosses want to take it out on him).  He can't be blamed, however, for the group of mobsters that he works for and with are a buffoonish bunch.  Their a very dim gang who can't shoot straight, fitting all the mob stereotypes of more serious movies (fat, Italian men, who favour fancy suits or track suits, gaudy glasses, lacquered hair, giant Cadillacs).  Only they hang around their social club/hideout watching cartoons all day (on a side note: watch how the actions in the cartoons always translate to action in real life for these men, as if they are taking advice on how to live from Merry Melodies!).  It felt like Jarmusch was trying to throw a little mob-as-morons parody into his samurai flick.  They provided comic relief (one high-ranking mobster confounds his colleagues and the audience by breaking into a Flavor Flav rap!), and only sporadically took away from the solemnity of the film's themes.The film's score, provided by Wu Tang Clan's RZA, is probably it's most unique feature (or at least that's how it was hyped).  Comprised of laid back hip-hop beats, it was effective and understated in helping to establish moods (like a good score should).  And at times it gives the film, which had a tendency to meander off-track, a solid pocket of groove to jam over.Some people thought this film was too long.  I didn't.  A character like this needs a certain languid pacing to come off properly.  He is thoughtful and unhurried, and the film should be as well.  Just don't expect the story to move forward with any urgency, and I assure you that &quot;Ghost Dog&quot; will be a rewarding, if at times bewildering, experience.",4,The Tale of the Dog: Delightful and Bewildering,1009324800,"12 26, 2001",2001,4649,"['first', 'encounter', 'Jim', 'Jarmusch', 'movie', 'have', 'ask', 'who', ""'ve"", 'walked', 'paths', 'are', 'movies', 'always', 'disjointed', 'Do', 'always', 'mix', 'match', 'tone', 'theme', 'creating', 'strange', 'wondrous', 'confusing', 'dichotomies', 'sadness', 'always', 'so', 'easily', 'mixed', 'silly', 'laughter', 'so', 'think', ""'ll"", 'take', 'more', 'walks', 'down', 'Jarmusch', 'Way', 'quot', 'Ghost', 'Dog', 'quot', 'oddball', 'flaws', 'sure', 'had', 'entertained.Its', 'basic', 'conceit', 'modern', 'urban', 'world', 'one', 'must', 'follow', 'tenets', 'samurai', 'order', 'survive', 'thrive', 'only', 'way', 'kill', 'be', 'killed', 'bringing', 'pain', 'thought', 'Jarmusch', 'missed', 'boat', 'terms', 'allowing', 'idea', 'prosper', 'Even', 'liberally', 'Hagakure', 'quot', 'Book', 'Samurai', 'quot', 'scene', 'most', 'tenets', 'appear', 'be', 'mere', 'fashion', 'tips', 'i.e.', 'how', 'look', 'bad', 'mutha', 'when', 'walking', 'neighbourhood', 'being', 'said', 'Jarmusch', 'succeed', 'allowing', 'Hagakure', 'ideas', 'prosper', 'choice', 'direction', 'lead', 'actorForest', 'Whitaker', 'successful', 'portrayal', 'Ghost', 'Dog', 'slowly', 'lazy', 'left', 'eye', 'usually', 'distraction', 'used', 'great', 'effect', 'here', 'showing', 'relaxed', 'Zen', 'nature', 'when', 'practicing', 'sword', 'work', 'rooftops', 'New', 'York', 'Whitaker', 'beefy', 'man', 'grace', 'agility', 'cat', 'favourite', 'part', 'work', 'physicality', 'was', 'stunning', 'was', 'how', ""'d"", 're-holster', 'guns', ""'d"", 'swirl', 'around', 'were', 'samurai', 'swords', 'looking', 'sheath.Except', 'laid-back', 'narration', 'role', 'nearly', 'silent', 'Whitaker', 'silence', 'well', 'allowing', 'expressions', 'body', 'language', 'tell', 'further', 'story', 'When', 'interact', 'people', 'results', 'can', 'be', 'hit', 'miss', 'always', 'unusual', 'best', 'friend', 'Haitian', 'ice', 'cream', 'man', 'only', 'French', 'usually', 'megaphone', 'two', 'men', 'appear', 'able', 'communicate', 'other', 'perfectly', 'even', 'knowing', 'are', 'scenes', 'provide', 'light', 'touch', 'became', 'tiresome', 'awhile', 'still', 'provided', 'film', 'fine', 'comic', 'moments', 'Other', 'scenes', 'involving', 'curious', 'little', 'girl', 'allow', 'Whitaker', 'show', 'Ghost', 'Dog', 'tender', 'side', 'scenes', 'together', 'are', 'touching', 'typical', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'scenario', 'where', 'able', 'cut', 'gruff', 'veneer', 'gentleness', 'beneath', 'Ghost', 'Dog', 'moments', 'Louie', 'mobster', 'who', 'once', 'saved', 'life', 'who', 'now', 'hit', 'man', 'relationship', 'up', 'movie', 'narrative', 'thrust', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'have', 'narrative', 'thrust', 'go', 'well', ""you-saved-me-so-now-I'm-in-your-debt"", 'cliches', 'create', 'something', 'truly', 'ridiculous.Louie', 'man', 'tremendous', 'ennui', 'who', 'can', 'barely', 'muster', 'energy', 'react', 'horrific', 'situations', 'anymore', 'actually', 'funny', 'see', 'how', 'quickly', 'resigned', 'fate', 'when', 'hit', 'wrong', 'bosses', 'want', 'take', 'out', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'blamed', 'however', 'group', 'mobsters', 'are', 'buffoonish', 'bunch', 'very', 'dim', 'gang', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'shoot', 'straight', 'fitting', 'mob', 'stereotypes', 'more', 'serious', 'movies', 'fat', 'Italian', 'men', 'who', 'favour', 'fancy', 'suits', 'track', 'suits', 'gaudy', 'glasses', 'lacquered', 'hair', 'giant', 'Cadillacs', 'Only', 'hang', 'social', 'club/hideout', 'watching', 'cartoons', 'day', 'side', 'note', 'watch', 'how', 'actions', 'cartoons', 'always', 'translate', 'action', 'real', 'life', 'men', 'are', 'taking', 'advice', 'how', 'live', 'Merry', 'Melodies', 'felt', 'Jarmusch', 'was', 'trying', 'throw', 'little', 'mob-as-morons', 'parody', 'samurai', 'flick', 'provided', 'comic', 'relief', 'one', 'high-ranking', 'mobster', 'colleagues', 'audience', 'breaking', 'Flavor', 'Flav', 'rap', 'only', 'sporadically', 'took', 'away', 'solemnity', 'film', 'themes.The', 'film', 'score', 'provided', 'Wu', 'Tang', 'Clan', 'RZA', 'probably', 'most', 'unique', 'feature', 'least', 'how', 'was', 'hyped', 'Comprised', 'laid', 'back', 'hip-hop', 'beats', 'was', 'effective', 'understated', 'helping', 'establish', 'moods', 'good', 'score', 'should', 'times', 'film', 'had', 'tendency', 'meander', 'off-track', 'solid', 'pocket', 'groove', 'jam', 'over.Some', 'people', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'too', 'long', 'did', ""n't"", 'character', 'certain', 'languid', 'pacing', 'come', 'off', 'properly', 'thoughtful', 'unhurried', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'as', 'well', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'story', 'move', 'forward', 'urgency', 'assure', 'quot', 'Ghost', 'Dog', 'quot', 'will', 'be', 'rewarding', 'times', 'bewildering', 'experience']",Ghost Dog - The Way of the Samurai VHS

It has the slow, mellow, easy pacing interrupted by moments of intense violence, the intriguing but elusive characters who follow their own mysterious moral code even to their death if necessary.  It is funny, and even hilarious at times; it is political insofar as it plays with and criticizes racial and ethnic stereotyping; it has one of the best soundtracks of any films (done by the RZA of Wu Tang Clan fame); scenes are joined together by intertitles containing intriguing passages from the Hagakure: the Book of the Samurai, read smoothly by the Ghost Dog himself; it raises existential questions of how to live appropriately in the face of death and the collapse of the forms that give meaning to our lives; and, best of all, it stars Forrest Whittaker in the role he was born to play!  That alone makes this a dvd worth owning at almost any price; and at this price I can't see how anyone who loves film does not own a copy.On a personal note: when I took one of my classes (on American Independent Film) to the Sundance film festival a few years ago, someone asked me whether I hoped to see any stars.  I hadn't really thought about it because I'm not that starstruck, I just like movies.  But then it came to me: the whole trip would be worth it if I could meet Forrest Whittaker.  And I did!  He's a very big man, just as impressive in life as he is on film.  We were at a party for one of the smaller satellite festivals and I talked to him for a while, and finally said: ""hey, I really loved what you did in Ghost Dog.""

It is all about being cool and free.Although the title seems ominous of a darker action waiting to break out, theatrically it tends to impress more than when the fake squibs and dust start puffing out of ancient actor's jacket padding, and to this I say, go see a John Woo movie instead if you want more from that, there is a message in the way, that is very fundamental - `There is something to be learned from a rainstorm. When meeting with a sudden shower, you try not to get wet and run quickly along the road. By doing such things as passing under the eaves of houses, you still get wet. When you are resolved from the beginning, you will not be perplexed, though you will still get the same soaking. This understanding extends to all things.' - If you are going to get wet, get wet. So imagine this in the mind of an assassin.There are many intimate moments between English-less ice-cream salesmen, little girls who can talk to strangers who won't abuse them, mafia hit-men who are so outside of the scene that even their landlord kick's them around - corky throughout, probably in order not to take itself too seriously, ends up doing just that, the director likes comedy elements in his films, here the comic interludes suite the style, but you just wonder how much darker ""Ghost Dog"" could have been, none-the-less we are blubbering, because it is very dark at times, and for of course for what happens to be one of the best natural characters visualized for the silver screen since Ash in ""Evil Dead II"", ""Ghost Dog"" is great in anyone's collection.",5,The Way of the Independent Film Makers - GD is a character!,1111968000,"03 28, 2005",2005,2492,"['film', 'method', 'determination', 'next', 'director', 'Dead', 'Man', 'everybody', 'best', 'Whitaker', 'performance', 'stealing', 'one', 'coolest', 'role', 'ever', 'conceived', 'wholly', 'original', 'fat', 'black', 'assassin', 'religious', 'allegory', 'attitude', 'good', 'taste', 'cars', 'steal', 'gave', 'four', 'five', 'watching', 'cinema', 'wanted', 'more', 'action', 'now', 'DVD', 'much', 'better', 'presentation', 'hip-hop', 'start', 'when', 'was', 'tolerable', 'Ghost', 'Dog', 'hybrid', 'crime', 'drama', 'low-key', 'action', 'mostly', 'accompanied', 'ghosting', 'film', 'effect', 'philosophy', 'Samurai', 'warrior', 'Hagakure', 'Code', 'text', 'talkies', 'appear', 'now', 'again', 'film', 'independent', 'movie', 'aspiring', 'be', 'something', 'greater', 'art-house', 'origins', 'blasting', 'many', 'A-list', 'actors', 'director', 'attempts', 'similar', 'themes', 'bits', 'pieces', 'just', 'staying', 'low-key', 'target', 'being', 'cool', 'title', 'ominous', 'darker', 'action', 'waiting', 'break', 'out', 'theatrically', 'impress', 'more', 'when', 'fake', 'squibs', 'dust', 'start', 'puffing', 'ancient', 'actor', 'jacket', 'padding', 'say', 'go', 'see', 'John', 'Woo', 'movie', 'instead', 'want', 'more', 'message', 'way', 'very', 'fundamental', 'something', 'be', 'learned', 'rainstorm', 'When', 'meeting', 'sudden', 'shower', 'try', 'not', 'get', 'wet', 'run', 'quickly', 'road', 'doing', 'such', 'things', 'passing', 'eaves', 'houses', 'still', 'get', 'wet', 'When', 'are', 'resolved', 'beginning', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'perplexed', 'will', 'still', 'get', 'same', 'soaking', 'understanding', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'get', 'wet', 'get', 'wet', 'So', 'imagine', 'mind', 'are', 'many', 'intimate', 'moments', 'English-less', 'ice-cream', 'salesmen', 'little', 'girls', 'who', 'can', 'talk', 'strangers', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'abuse', 'hit-men', 'who', 'are', 'so', 'scene', 'even', 'landlord', 'kick', 'corky', 'probably', 'order', 'not', 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'up', 'doing', 'just', 'director', 'comedy', 'elements', 'films', 'here', 'comic', 'interludes', 'suite', 'style', 'just', 'wonder', 'how', 'much', 'darker', 'Ghost', 'Dog', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'none-the-less', 'are', 'blubbering', 'very', 'dark', 'times', 'course', 'what', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'natural', 'characters', 'visualized', 'silver', 'screen', 'Ash', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'II', 'Ghost', 'Dog', 'great', 'anyone', 'collection']",Ghost Dog - The Way of the Samurai VHS

Andersen ""redheaded booklover""","[7, 8]","This movie is truly a visual masterpiece - the scenes fit the action, the action fits the characters and there is not one wasted gesture or word in this movie. This is a great movie - not great in the sense that it has a feel good happy ending or that it ends how you might want it to end. It's great in a way that makes you think about life and loyalty, about how two different cultures collide and what honor is and how it might lead to your undoing.Forest Whitaker (a marvelous actor) is Ghost Dog, a samurai who has sworn his loyalty to a Mafia gangeter who once saved his life. Ghost Dog becomes a hitman for the Mafia, used when it's considered too dangerous for somebody else to do. He does his job well. but it confuses the Mafia simply because they don't understand his culture. Ghost Dog settles up his account with his boss once a year, he uses carrier pigeons to relay messages and lives simply - something the gangsters don't understand.He reads from the ""Hagakure"" everyday, ontemplating the meaning of the way of life he has chosen. The gangsters are one messed up bunch - dysfunctional doesn't even begin to describe them - and thier idea of culture seems to be old cartoons on tv. (Although the one doing the rap song is hilarious.)A hit goes wrong - well, actually it goes right but it's a political disaster for the gangsters. It is determined Ghost Dog must die. But how do you kill a samurai - especially one that seems to materialize from nowhere, hos no known address or phone number?The rest of the movie concerns itself with that matter, as well as Ghost Dog's friendship with a Haitian ice cream vendor - though they don't speak each other's languages, hey seem to understand each other almost instinctively. And Ghost Dog befriends a young girl. These relationships help you understand more about Ghost Dog.I won't give away the ending - the movie is very powerful and really must be seen to be appreciated. But it will leave you thinking about many, many things long after the movie is over and to me, that's a mark of a great movie.It's not a movie for everybody - it's not a John Woo movie or Jackie Chan - those are both good, but this is a much different, darker type of movie.

A pioneer and one of the driving forces within the new wave of independent filmmakers since the early `80s, he's an artist who is not afraid to take a chance and is constantly exploring new terrain.  When it comes to the arts, however, that adventurous spirit can also be a double-edged sword, and as another great artist, writer Ray Bradbury, will tell you, not every idea works; occasionally, what is created in the mind simply does not translate to the written page, nor to film, and for any number of reasons.  Which is seemingly the case with ""Ghost Dog:  The Way of the Samurai,"" written and directed by Jarmusch, the premise of which is powerful and engaging, but which simply does not materialize on the screen.Ghost Dog (Forest Whitaker) is a hit man for the mob, loyal to and working directly for a man named Louie (John Tormey), who had befriended him some years earlier at a critical juncture in Ghost Dog's life.  Now, however, circumstances have changed, and the mob bosses want Ghost Dog removed.  Permanently.  They are about to discover, though, that getting rid of Ghost Dog will be no easy task, as he lives a reclusive existence and follows the code of the ancient Samurai warriors.  And one of the tenets of that code prescribes viewing life as a dream, which is exactly the way Ghost Dog lives his life.  And this is ""his"" dream; and to effect their goal, the mob will have to negotiate Ghost Dog's terrain on his terms.  He may be only one man, but as they are about to learn, this one man is a formidable opponent.Jarmusch has crafted and delivered a film that is part philosophical character study, part action/drama, that comes across much as if Ingmar Bergman had directed ""Goodfellas.""  And actually, the philosophical ruminations and Ghost Dog's meditations work fairly well, presented as they are in ethereal terms that tend to be wistful and transporting in themselves.  In retrospect, what really does in Jarmusch and his efforts here is very simply a case of-- except for Whitaker-- extraordinarily bad acting.  The members of his ""mob"" are incredibly ineffective and unconvincing; what Jarmusch badly needed was a Pesci, a Joe Viterelli or even a Mike Starr to give some substance to his gang.  Unfortunately, he was stuck with the ""B"" team, and not even the brief presence of Henry Silva (as Ray Vargo) is enough to salvage much good from the results.  And it's a shame, because Jarmusch does have his moments here, and there is a powerful film hidden within, desperately attempting to break through.  But in the end, it never does, and the promise Jarmusch tenders remains uncharacteristically unfulfilled.The saving grace of the project is the performance by Forest Whitaker, who successfully immerses himself in the role of Ghost Dog and creates a believable, convincing character.  With an introspective approach, he credibly attains that level of detachment that defines the code by which Ghost Dog lives, that sense of living life as if it's a dream, which ultimately enables him to play it all out as a character of his own design and within the parameters of his own reality, which is far removed from that of the rest of the world and those who dwell within it.  Purely as a character study, in fact, this film is riveting at times, and can be thoroughly intriguing.  And for that, Jarmusch, of course, deserves credit; it's Whitaker's work, however, that brings it to fruition.The only other performance of note is turned in by Isaach De Bankole as Ghost Dog's friend, Raymond.  The fact that Raymond speaks and understands only French makes for some of the most engaging moments in the film, in fact, since Ghost Dog neither speaks nor understands French, but only English.  It's a novel touch that is so Jarmusch; and it's an indication of what this film could have been had Jarmusch moved more in that direction rather than toward the more questionable path upon which he ended up.The supporting cast includes Camille Winbush (Pearline), Cliff Gorman (Sonny), Frank Minucci (Big Angie), Richard Portnow (Handsome Frank) and Tricia Vessey (Louise).  In any given medium, the true artist dances to his own drum, and that defines Jim Jarmusch.  Independent film, especially, and the cinema in general, owes a debt of gratitude to his inventiveness and creative vision, to that kind of spirit of which he is imbued, that has taken film to a higher level.  ""Ghost Dog:  Way of the Samurai"" may not be his most memorable film, and is far from his greatest accomplishment, but it does demonstrate that Jim Jarmusch is alive and well as he continues to seek out new cinematic territory.  And even in this film there can be found a magic that is all it's own; and in the final analysis, it's all a part of what makes up the magic of the movies.",2,Not Up to the Usual Jarmusch Standard,1025395200,"06 30, 2002",2002,4916,"['Anyone', 'who', 'way', 'movies', 'are', 'made', 'what', 'make', 'magic', 'happen', 'admire', 'writer/director', 'Jim', 'Jarmusch', 'A', 'pioneer', 'one', 'driving', 'forces', 'new', 'wave', 'independent', 'filmmakers', 'early', '80s', 'artist', 'who', 'not', 'afraid', 'take', 'chance', 'constantly', 'exploring', 'new', 'terrain', 'When', 'arts', 'however', 'adventurous', 'spirit', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'double-edged', 'sword', 'great', 'artist', 'writer', 'Ray', 'Bradbury', 'will', 'tell', 'not', 'idea', 'occasionally', 'what', 'created', 'mind', 'simply', 'not', 'translate', 'written', 'page', 'film', 'number', 'reasons', 'Which', 'seemingly', 'case', 'Ghost', 'Dog', 'Way', 'Samurai', 'written', 'directed', 'Jarmusch', 'premise', 'powerful', 'engaging', 'simply', 'not', 'materialize', 'screen.Ghost', 'Dog', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'hit', 'man', 'mob', 'loyal', 'working', 'directly', 'man', 'named', 'Louie', 'John', 'Tormey', 'who', 'had', 'befriended', 'years', 'earlier', 'critical', 'juncture', 'Ghost', 'Dog', 'life', 'Now', 'however', 'circumstances', 'have', 'changed', 'mob', 'want', 'Ghost', 'Dog', 'removed', 'Permanently', 'are', 'discover', 'though', 'getting', 'rid', 'Ghost', 'Dog', 'will', 'be', 'easy', 'task', 'reclusive', 'existence', 'code', 'ancient', 'Samurai', 'warriors', 'one', 'tenets', 'code', 'viewing', 'life', 'dream', 'exactly', 'way', 'Ghost', 'Dog', 'life', 'dream', 'effect', 'goal', 'mob', 'will', 'have', 'negotiate', 'Ghost', 'Dog', 'terrain', 'terms', 'may', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'man', 'are', 'learn', 'one', 'man', 'formidable', 'opponent.Jarmusch', 'crafted', 'delivered', 'film', 'part', 'philosophical', 'character', 'study', 'part', 'action/drama', 'across', 'much', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'had', 'directed', 'Goodfellas', 'actually', 'philosophical', 'ruminations', 'Ghost', 'Dog', 'meditations', 'work', 'fairly', 'well', 'presented', 'are', 'ethereal', 'terms', 'tend', 'be', 'wistful', 'transporting', 'retrospect', 'what', 'really', 'Jarmusch', 'efforts', 'here', 'very', 'simply', 'case', 'Whitaker', 'extraordinarily', 'bad', 'acting', 'members', 'mob', 'are', 'incredibly', 'ineffective', 'unconvincing', 'what', 'Jarmusch', 'badly', 'needed', 'was', 'Pesci', 'Joe', 'Viterelli', 'even', 'Mike', 'Starr', 'give', 'substance', 'gang', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'stuck', 'B', 'team', 'not', 'even', 'brief', 'presence', 'Henry', 'Silva', 'Ray', 'Vargo', 'enough', 'salvage', 'much', 'good', 'results', 'shame', 'Jarmusch', 'have', 'moments', 'here', 'powerful', 'film', 'hidden', 'desperately', 'attempting', 'break', 'end', 'never', 'promise', 'Jarmusch', 'tenders', 'uncharacteristically', 'unfulfilled.The', 'saving', 'grace', 'project', 'performance', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'who', 'successfully', 'role', 'Ghost', 'Dog', 'believable', 'convincing', 'character', 'introspective', 'approach', 'credibly', 'level', 'detachment', 'code', 'Ghost', 'Dog', 'sense', 'living', 'life', 'dream', 'ultimately', 'play', 'out', 'character', 'own', 'design', 'parameters', 'own', 'reality', 'far', 'removed', 'rest', 'world', 'who', 'dwell', 'Purely', 'character', 'study', 'fact', 'film', 'riveting', 'times', 'can', 'be', 'thoroughly', 'intriguing', 'Jarmusch', 'course', 'credit', 'Whitaker', 'work', 'however', 'fruition.The', 'only', 'other', 'performance', 'note', 'turned', 'Isaach', 'De', 'Bankole', 'Ghost', 'Dog', 'friend', 'Raymond', 'fact', 'Raymond', 'speaks', 'only', 'French', 'most', 'engaging', 'moments', 'film', 'fact', 'Ghost', 'Dog', 'speaks', 'understands', 'French', 'only', 'English', 'novel', 'touch', 'so', 'Jarmusch', 'indication', 'what', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'Jarmusch', 'moved', 'more', 'direction', 'rather', 'more', 'questionable', 'path', 'ended', 'up.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Camille', 'Winbush', 'Pearline', 'Cliff', 'Gorman', 'Sonny', 'Frank', 'Minucci', 'Big', 'Angie', 'Richard', 'Portnow', 'Handsome', 'Frank', 'Tricia', 'Vessey', 'Louise', 'given', 'medium', 'true', 'artist', 'dances', 'own', 'drum', 'defines', 'Jim', 'Jarmusch', 'Independent', 'film', 'especially', 'cinema', 'general', 'debt', 'gratitude', 'inventiveness', 'creative', 'vision', 'kind', 'spirit', 'imbued', 'taken', 'film', 'higher', 'level', 'Ghost', 'Dog', 'Way', 'Samurai', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'most', 'memorable', 'film', 'far', 'greatest', 'accomplishment', 'demonstrate', 'Jim', 'Jarmusch', 'alive', 'well', 'seek', 'out', 'new', 'cinematic', 'territory', 'even', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'magic', 'own', 'final', 'analysis', 'part', 'what', 'up', 'magic', 'movies']",Ghost Dog - The Way of the Samurai VHS
485120,A38ELBK7FLXGOY,6305958181,Richard Wells,"[5, 7]","&quot;Ghost Dog&quot; is the first Jim Jarmusch movie I've seen, and it was a quirky little treat.  The movie lopes along in much the same rhythm Forest Whitaker chooses for his character's walk, and the pleasure of a lope is that it may seem you're getting nowhere fast, but you are moving along and you get to notice the sights along the way.  The sights in this movie set you up for at least one double-take in every scene.  &quot;Did I really see that?&quot;  &quot;Did he really say that?&quot;  The mafia chieftans are painted with broad strokes - nobody's really that stupid, but it's their buffonery that makes them dangerous, and oddly charming. Almost every act of violence is foreshadowed by a cartoon clip that the cartoon-addicted mafiosi are watching before situations hit the fan.  It would be an evening of viewing just to compare the cartoons with the live action that follows.  Their code of honor certainly comes more from comic book absurdities than life.  They kill each other because they are cartoon characters, and that's what cartoon characters do. Ghost Dog's (Whitaker's) actions are foreshadowed by excerpts from the &quot;Book of the Samurai&quot; and as honorable as they may seem they are just as absurd as the mafiosi, and as lovable as he may be he's sad in his understanding that he's an anachronism.  Ghost Dog's interactions with his best friend, the ice-cream man, and his new friend, a highly literate little girl, are pure pleasure.  There is an affection that passes between the characters that is lovely to behold.  Jarmusch seems to have decided that absurdity plays best as deadpan, and this movie is a study in the best and most consistent deadpan I've ever seen.  Even the stray dog seems like a reincarnation of Buster Keaton. I recommend this movie in the same way I'd recommend &quot;Wings of Desire&quot; - settle back, hold your judgement, and just let the story carry you along.  You may feel like you're in a row boat on a gently moving river with no paddles and a little rough water, but - consider it a vacation.",4,Hooray for this Movie,985737600,"03 28, 2001",2001,2066,"['quot', 'Ghost', 'Dog', 'quot', 'first', 'Jim', 'Jarmusch', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'was', 'quirky', 'little', 'treat', 'movie', 'along', 'much', 'same', 'rhythm', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'character', 'walk', 'pleasure', 'lope', 'may', 'seem', ""'re"", 'getting', 'nowhere', 'fast', 'are', 'moving', 'along', 'get', 'notice', 'sights', 'way', 'sights', 'movie', 'set', 'least', 'one', 'double-take', 'scene', 'quot', 'Did', 'really', 'see', 'quot', 'quot', 'Did', 'really', 'say', 'quot', 'mafia', 'chieftans', 'are', 'painted', 'broad', 'strokes', 'nobody', 'really', 'stupid', 'buffonery', 'dangerous', 'oddly', 'charming', 'Almost', 'act', 'violence', 'foreshadowed', 'cartoon', 'clip', 'cartoon-addicted', 'mafiosi', 'are', 'watching', 'situations', 'hit', 'fan', 'would', 'be', 'evening', 'viewing', 'just', 'compare', 'cartoons', 'live', 'action', 'code', 'honor', 'certainly', 'more', 'comic', 'book', 'absurdities', 'life', 'kill', 'other', 'are', 'cartoon', 'characters', 'what', 'cartoon', 'characters', 'do', 'Ghost', 'Dog', 'Whitaker', 'actions', 'are', 'foreshadowed', 'excerpts', 'quot', 'Book', 'Samurai', 'quot', 'as', 'honorable', 'may', 'seem', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'absurd', 'mafiosi', 'as', 'lovable', 'may', 'be', 'sad', 'understanding', 'anachronism', 'Ghost', 'Dog', 'interactions', 'best', 'friend', 'ice-cream', 'man', 'new', 'friend', 'highly', 'literate', 'little', 'girl', 'are', 'pure', 'pleasure', 'affection', 'characters', 'lovely', 'behold', 'Jarmusch', 'have', 'decided', 'absurdity', 'best', 'deadpan', 'movie', 'study', 'best', 'most', 'consistent', 'deadpan', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Even', 'stray', 'dog', 'reincarnation', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'recommend', 'movie', 'same', 'way', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'quot', 'Wings', 'Desire', 'quot', 'settle', 'back', 'hold', 'judgement', 'just', 'let', 'story', 'carry', 'may', 'feel', ""'re"", 'row', 'boat', 'gently', 'moving', 'river', 'paddles', 'little', 'rough', 'water', 'consider', 'vacation']",Ghost Dog - The Way of the Samurai VHS

I caught it accidentally on the Independent Film Channel and immediately ordered a copy. the mix of modern urban culture with the philosophy of ancient Japan is pure genius. The old decaying mafia family is so well written and acted that their scenes are some of the best gangster scenes ever put on film. A mafia don who quotes Public Enemy is one of many cultural juxtapositions that make this such a rich film. The soundtrack is awsome and Forrest Whitaker is absolutely perfect in the lead role.

You have seen movies with elements of Ghost Dog before, but you have never seen anything like this.  Cartoon watching, rapping Mafiosos.  A hip-hop samurai.  Yet, it is not a comedy.  This movie is really about codes of honor, respect, and I dare argue some kind of hope.  It is strikingly original and the hip-hop score works wonders. Forrest Whitaker, a supremely talented actor, gives a masterful performance.  I was intrigued by the newspaper reviews, but I think the standard reviewers were confused.  What I love most  about this movie are the chances that Jarmusch takes.  I would love to see the mainstream studios put out bold pictures like this.  The extras on the DVD, particularly the documentary and deleted scenes are not so good.  I would have preferred Jarmusch and Whitaker on a commentary track.

485123,A2E96W60SMKKZL,6305958181,"Robert W. Grandcolas ""Stiggs""","[4, 9]","This film was made during the height of the rap, ghetto, hoodlum, gangsta, bling bling craze. The movie is saturated with the stuff - giant gold medallions, repetitious drum rhythms, rap music, hooded sweatshirts, slow motion walking, possees, prestige cars, hoodlum hand signing, Ebonics, crab walking etc etc. (is this stuff still popular by the way?)Every non-white person in the film reads books on philosophy, are kindhearted, gentle, one with nature (or pigeons at least), courteous, and principled...whether they are a gang member, a hitman, an eight year old or the ice-cream-man. Every white person (whitey I suppose) in the film is portrayed as an ignorant, prejudiced, flabby, cold hearted, dislikeable, unprincipled, prejudiced slob or slut who's entire knowledge of the world comes from watching cartoons from the 40s and 50s.  No one is perfect but I really don't think the races are distinguished from each other as succinctly as this film professes.  What a message!All the white actors performances either falls flat, are over the top, unrealistic or very stilted. A George Romero zombie actor does a better job. Even the usually excellent B action star Henry Silva's acting is poor or at least very very strange and he is way underused. I have to believe it is what the director wanted and is not the actors' fault.Ghost Dog is really not an action movies in spite of a numerous killings. The film is way too slow for that but it's not a suspense film either as the pasty white mobsters are a bunch of soft, dimwitted, dopey, doughy, slow moving, cartoon watching, octogenarians with bad physiques and over cooked Bayonne, Brooklyn, Bronx accents(?) who could not scare a five year old.  By the way - they never do let you know where this thing is supposed to be taking place.  The Highway State? Where is that?It's like watching a tired 80s screwball gangster disco movie only with rap and bling bling fashion instead of bell bottoms and flare collared shirts. A different fad a different time era. Just as dated, and pretty much as lame.For anyone who is offended by language - Ghost dog is peppered - OK battered with the F word and the N word and not the N word with the ""ah"" sound at the end. It's the N word the way we don't like it, used liberally and loud in offensive ways.Another aspect in the film is the re-occurring reading from the book of rules for Samurai warriors. These passages are read by our hero/hitman Ghost Dog - complete with blacked out title cards (just in case you might have problems understanding the Ghost Dog)  This comes off as a cringingly pretentious clich&eacute;. I defy anyone to get anything out of these Samurai rules - at least from the way they are represented in the movie.  The only one that I can somewhat recall goes something like this - if it rains and you run fast and move from roof to roof - you are still likely to get wet. Well dahh. I guess we are supposed to apply this rule to other aspects of life. Like whenever we decide we need to kill someone I suppose.  I have to believe something got lost in the translation from Japanese to English - poor Ghosty - this book is his only guide.A far easier to understand part of the film - is the re-occurring cartoons which worked to some degree as they are used to either comment on the action or to predict something that is about to happen.  The only problem is that the cartoons are for more annoying than not and the zombie-like mobster cartoon watchers lives revolve around these bad cartoons for reasons never explained. They are clearly not learning anything from them.Finally to Forest Whitaker - Ghost Dog.  Forest is the only redeeming aspect of the entire film.  Part of the reason for this is his very unconventional appearance for the role he is playing. Yes he is one of slowest, out shape samurai warriors we will ever see. He even looks like a jelly donut when he is shot. He is big, wide and lumbers even when practicing his samurai sword moves. (if Ghost Dog comes after you - just run - There is no way Ghost Dog is going to catch you).  For no apparent reason Ghost Dog goes in and out of gansta body language and speech  - this inconsistency hurt Forest's performance. He also tends to play drab rap on his CD player to our great dissatisfaction as it serves as the soundtrack (Holst or Bach or even traditional Japanese would have been far more bad ass).  But luckily Forest's face works for him and saved the film from a one star review.  His inner world is telegraphed by what is essentially a calm, kindly, sad, gentle, demeanor, and expressions, and his calculated actions and his long uncritical observant gazes give him the only character with some kind of believability. He may have the traits of a thug but he never comes off as one. Unfortunately Forest is often saddled with some pretty bad dialogue and illogical situations.  His ludicrous walk up the street at the end of the film for one. (That Samurai book is sure filled with some bad advice and poor Ghosty seems to lack the mental skills to think outside the box...er book.)So if the film is not suspenseful and not an action movie - what is it?  I have to believe it is working from an artistic philosophical, and social point of view. Philosophically: maybe achieving excellence or duty?  Socially: maybe communication? Art - combining a bunch of former film elements - French film noire, hit men films, mob films, Japanese martial arts films, spaghetti westerns, and revenge films, along with the gangsta/rap genre. But what you end up with (which one usually ends up with when you combine way too many elements) is a very uneven hodge podge with no real cohesion - kind of a mess.The plot - and I do not believe this is spoiler - I won't tell the ending. Forest Whitaker's life is saved by a low grade mobster. Forest reads a book on the rules of the Samurai, changes his name to Ghost Dog and decides (from the book's advice) that he must be the mobster's servant or retainer as Ghost Dog likes to say. Which means the mobster is his boss for life meaning Ghost will ""take-out"" folks for this mobster guy at bargain prices.  Not ""wash the guys car"" or be his ""temporary man servant"" or ""send a card at Christmas"" mind you, but murder people for the guy. Why couldn't Ghost Dog have read a book by Dale Carnegie? or maybe had his life saved by a CPA? It would have saved everyone allot of trouble. The Samurai book has allot of very bad advice in it such as you must respect your boss to a very high degree - like let him kill you - if he so chooses. (You might want to check with your omsbudsman first before you go along with that one)  Well as things would have it the mob puts a hit on poor ole G-Dog because G-Dog killed some dumb guy for them (which really made no sense at all) and after that its a pretty typical and predictable plot where the allusive and deadly hitman gets a hit put on him by the guys he does hits for.  It's not a new plot by any means but we could have lived with it if it had been done better.If anyone is interested or patent enough who would enjoy a ""thoughtful"" and very influential, subtitled in English, hit man movie.  I suggest you pick up the even slower, more cerebral, much cooler, much better, (and contains no racism), much older (but not as much dated film ) ""Le Samurai"" - A film that had to have influenced Ghost Dog and many other hit man films to no little degree.Allot of people loved Ghost Dog - check out the numerous 5 star reviews - so maybe it's a cultural thing. I for one found it to have a very low believability quotient, very uneven, pretty dull,(very close to mind numbing) ludicrously acted, questionably scripted, very repetitious, and often annoying mob hit man revenge film with very heavy and very dated the gansta/rap influences.The films wide screen photography is very good and looks great great on DVD, crisp and clear and the sound is a decent 5 channel surround - not to many uses of the surround  but no complaints either.On a final note - a real cute stray ""ghost"" dog showed up in the film twice -he was cool to look at - too bad he wasn't used in the movie more.  There was also a very nice opening aerial scene where the credits role - That scene contained the one piece of music in the film that I liked.",2,a cultural thing I suppose,1306454400,"05 27,

But I didn't love it - and I hate the fact that I didn't.The elements I loved revolved around Ghost Dog himself - his rooftop lifestyle, the quotes throughout, his mysticism with animals and ancient paths, his training, his intuitive relationship to the ice cream vendor. While some of his scenes were dragged down by unsteady pacing, overall a great aura was created through cinematography, acting, and script.But cue the Italian gangsters and suddenly it's as if I'm watching two movies at the same time.I realize they were purposely designed to be parodies of themselves, but it doesn't work here. Save it for Naked Gun 19 1/2 or whatever. All the tension and mystique built up by Ghost Dog is wiped out by the cartoonish ineptitude of these gangsters.Ghost Dog needed a worthy adversary, and not for one moment did I believe any of them (or all of them lined up for the picking in a scene right out of a video game) threatened this highly trained assassin in any way.The action sequences had no tension as a result - Ghost Dog was always in control.The core of the film and its wonderful premise do work great, though, and it is redeemed in the end.

485125,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,6305958181,Roland E. Zwick,"[10, 24]","**1/2  Jim Jarmusch's films have always been an acquired taste - and ""Ghost Dog"" is, assuredly, no exception.  Not content to spin out straightforward narratives, nor to adhere to the standard strictures of any particular genre, Jarmusch at least deserves credit for his originality, iconoclasm and daring.  But such an approach to filmmaking comes with some built-in pitfalls and risks, and, in Jarmusch's case, the quality of his films has often been much less than the sum of their impressive parts.  Furthermore, a filmmaker who so deliberately taxes the patience of his audience may find more people leaving the theatre than coming in.In both plot and style, ""Ghost Dog"" is a bizarre hybrid - made up of equal parts samurai adventure tale (though there is no sword fighting), urban street crime drama and Italian mafia gangster film.  Forrest Whitaker plays the mysterious Ghost Dog, a black man steeped in the ways of the ancient Samurai Code.  Having been saved from death eight years earlier by an Italian mobster, Ghost Dog now dedicates himself, according to the samurai oath of loyalty, to fulfilling the needs and desires of his new ""master.""  Thus, Ghost Dog spends his time gunning down ""contracts"" as per his leader's request.  But with his latest ""hit,"" Ghost Dog has struck too close to the mafia boss himself - and now the hunter has become the hunted.The plotting, which is convoluted and inscrutable much of the time, is obviously not the area in which Jarmusch's heart - as both writer and director - truly lies.  Style has always been this filmmaker's main preoccupation, and ""Ghost Dog"" does manage to combine just enough ""slightly off"" elements effectively to create a world rich in mysticism and exoticism.  The mere concept of an urban black gangster adhering to an ancient Japanese code - involved with a group of Italian gangsters adhering to their own similar ancient code - somehow lends itself to the exotic.  Moreover, Jarmusch's methodical and deliberate pacing, his use of a slowly gliding camera, his reliance on a haunting urban soundtrack all contribute to establishing and effectively maintaining the air of surrealism found in the concept itself.Yet, for all its undeniable virtues, ""Ghost Dog"" is, ultimately, not a very compelling film.  Part of the problem rests in the fact that, for all its originality of vision, the film emerges, finally, as a bit too pretentious, smug and self-satisfied.  We are supposed to see Ghost Dog as somehow nobler than his mafia counterparts because he seems motivated by a higher cause - the ancient samurai code.  Snippets of the code are read to us and flashed on the screen during scene fade-outs to make us appreciate the ""beauty"" and ""wisdom"" of this classic belief system.  Yet any way you cut it or gussy it up, Ghost Dog is STILL nothing more than a cold-blooded killer - love pigeons, dogs, cutesy ice cream vendors and adorable little girls though he may.  Just because the samurai code has the concept of ""tradition"" behind it doesn't make it necessarily worthy of respect or admiration.  And just because Ghost Dog is so dedicated to the rule of ""loyalty"" that he will mow down dozens of men because his ""master"" asks him to doesn't make him any more heroic than the mafia leaders who - not being as poetic by nature I guess - have the sad misfortune of couching their oaths of loyalty in much less self-congratulatory terms.  ""Tradition,"" as Tevye was forced to learn, is not, in and of itself, inherently superior to more enlightened thinking simply because it has managed to survive many centuries or even millennia intact.  The theme of the film then simply becomes offensive when it is obviously intended to be deep and meaningful.  Given that situation, we find ourselves less inclined to go along with the director's patience-demanding glacial pacing.Thus, ""Ghost Dog,"" unless you are a diehard Jarmusch devotee, will probably end for you long before the closing credits roll by.",2,"original, pretentious, atmospheric, dull - take your pick",984182400,"03 10, 2001",2001,3973,"['**1/2', 'Jim', 'Jarmusch', 'films', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'acquired', 'taste', 'Ghost', 'Dog', 'assuredly', 'exception', 'Not', 'content', 'spin', 'out', 'straightforward', 'narratives', 'adhere', 'standard', 'strictures', 'particular', 'genre', 'Jarmusch', 'least', 'deserves', 'credit', 'originality', 'iconoclasm', 'daring', 'such', 'approach', 'filmmaking', 'built-in', 'pitfalls', 'risks', 'Jarmusch', 'case', 'quality', 'films', 'often', 'been', 'much', 'less', 'sum', 'impressive', 'parts', 'Furthermore', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'so', 'deliberately', 'taxes', 'patience', 'audience', 'may', 'find', 'more', 'people', 'leaving', 'theatre', 'coming', 'in.In', 'plot', 'style', 'Ghost', 'Dog', 'bizarre', 'hybrid', 'made', 'equal', 'parts', 'samurai', 'adventure', 'tale', 'sword', 'fighting', 'urban', 'street', 'crime', 'drama', 'Italian', 'mafia', 'gangster', 'film', 'Forrest', 'Whitaker', 'mysterious', 'Ghost', 'Dog', 'black', 'man', 'steeped', 'ways', 'ancient', 'Samurai', 'Code', 'Having', 'been', 'saved', 'death', 'eight', 'years', 'earlier', 'Italian', 'mobster', 'Ghost', 'Dog', 'now', 'according', 'samurai', 'oath', 'loyalty', 'fulfilling', 'needs', 'desires', 'new', 'master', 'Thus', 'Ghost', 'Dog', 'time', 'gunning', 'down', 'contracts', 'leader', 'request', 'latest', 'hit', 'Ghost', 'Dog', 'struck', 'too', 'close', 'mafia', 'boss', 'now', 'hunter', 'become', 'hunted.The', 'plotting', 'convoluted', 'inscrutable', 'much', 'time', 'obviously', 'not', 'area', 'Jarmusch', 'heart', 'writer', 'director', 'truly', 'Style', 'always', 'been', 'filmmaker', 'main', 'preoccupation', 'Ghost', 'Dog', 'manage', 'combine', 'just', 'enough', 'slightly', 'elements', 'effectively', 'create', 'world', 'rich', 'mysticism', 'exoticism', 'mere', 'concept', 'urban', 'black', 'gangster', 'adhering', 'ancient', 'Japanese', 'code', 'involved', 'group', 'Italian', 'gangsters', 'adhering', 'own', 'similar', 'ancient', 'code', 'somehow', 'exotic', 'Moreover', 'Jarmusch', 'methodical', 'deliberate', 'pacing', 'use', 'slowly', 'gliding', 'camera', 'reliance', 'haunting', 'urban', 'soundtrack', 'contribute', 'establishing', 'effectively', 'maintaining', 'air', 'surrealism', 'found', 'concept', 'itself.Yet', 'undeniable', 'virtues', 'Ghost', 'Dog', 'ultimately', 'not', 'very', 'compelling', 'film', 'Part', 'problem', 'fact', 'originality', 'vision', 'film', 'finally', 'bit', 'too', 'pretentious', 'smug', 'self-satisfied', 'are', 'supposed', 'see', 'Ghost', 'Dog', 'somehow', 'nobler', 'mafia', 'counterparts', 'motivated', 'higher', 'cause', 'ancient', 'samurai', 'code', 'Snippets', 'code', 'are', 'read', 'flashed', 'screen', 'scene', 'fade-outs', 'make', 'appreciate', 'beauty', 'wisdom', 'classic', 'belief', 'system', 'way', 'cut', 'gussy', 'up', 'Ghost', 'Dog', 'STILL', 'nothing', 'more', 'cold-blooded', 'killer', 'love', 'pigeons', 'dogs', 'cutesy', 'ice', 'cream', 'vendors', 'adorable', 'little', 'girls', 'may', 'Just', 'samurai', 'code', 'concept', 'tradition', ""n't"", 'make', 'necessarily', 'respect', 'admiration', 'just', 'Ghost', 'Dog', 'so', 'dedicated', 'rule', 'loyalty', 'will', 'mow', 'down', 'dozens', 'men', 'master', ""n't"", 'make', 'more', 'heroic', 'mafia', 'leaders', 'who', 'not', 'being', 'poetic', 'nature', 'guess', 'have', 'sad', 'misfortune', 'couching', 'oaths', 'loyalty', 'much', 'less', 'self-congratulatory', 'terms', 'Tradition', 'Tevye', 'was', 'forced', 'learn', 'not', 'inherently', 'superior', 'more', 'enlightened', 'thinking', 'simply', 'managed', 'survive', 'many', 'centuries', 'even', 'millennia', 'intact', 'theme', 'film', 'then', 'simply', 'offensive', 'when', 'obviously', 'intended', 'be', 'deep', 'meaningful', 'Given', 'situation', 'find', 'less', 'inclined', 'go', 'along', 'director', 'patience-demanding', 'glacial', 'pacing.Thus', 'Ghost', 'Dog', 'are', 'diehard', 'Jarmusch', 'devotee', 'will', 'probably', 'end', 'long', 'closing', 'credits', 'roll']",Ghost Dog - The Way of the Samurai VHS

First, a comment about the &quot;Action&quot; in this movie.  It seems that a lot of people find this to be one of the weaker parts of the movie, as Jarmusch is not an action director by any means.  Personally, I found it to be excellent.  The actions scenes are usually simple, clean, and beautiful.  The deaths are quick and efficient, just like the way a Samurai kills.  They reminded me of the style of Japanese Samurai films.  No extended firefights or brawls, just a few quick slashes of the sword, or in this case, a few quick squeezes of the trigger, and the enemies fall.  Jarmusch is like a Samurai director.  The camera lingers on the seemingly inconsequential and minor details, like a Haiku.  The most telling moments are in the inbetween conversations between characters, the moments of comedy and relaxation.  Then there is a sharp moment of some critical event, an assasination or some such event, and then the haiku flows again.

485132,A2RN2AO4BE6F4K,6305958181,"Scott Bright ""scottypotty""","[3, 12]","Movie Summary:  Ghost Dog was getting the crap beat out of him one day when a two bit gangster saved his life. Because of this, Ghost Dog promises his samurai based loyalty to this gangster. Ghost Dog lives as he thinks the samurai did. He reads about the culture and raises pigeons. His best friend is a French ice cream man who speaks no English. It works out well though since Ghost Dog speaks no French. And he kills people for money payable once a year on the first day of autumn.My Opinion:  This is a strange little movie. It could have worked, but it's got some problems. The mobsters who are suppose to be the bad guys are never very threatening. They are all just silly cartoon characters. Yeah I know cartoons are a motif in the movie. But without a strong antagonist in the film, Ghost Dog is never really tested. His values, morals, and physical skills are never put to the test. This would have made things interesting. The attempts at comedy (and I'm assuming that they were really attempts at comedy) fall way short and end up being just plain sad. The way Ghost Dog and the French ice cream man say the same things without knowing it just does not fit in. It doesn't lighten up the movie, it makes it uncomfortable. The mobsters weren't funny either, just silly. Forest Whitaker does put in a very good performance and the excerpts from the samurai manual are interesting as well.DVD Quality:  Widescreen anamorphic 1.85:1.

Wonderful acting, really creative, dark-yet-funny direction, and much-above-average production values make this movie a near classic. The story is pretty straightforward - but for only those that cannot look into the many layers of characterization of the killer. The best scenes definitely involve Ghost Dog's interaction with a little African American girl, to whom he seeks to bequeath his repertoire of books. Not only is the photography top notch (don't MISS the opening sequences), but also very human in the way it treats its subjects. There is no &quot;beautification&quot; of any character - everyone is presented the same way for the viewer to draw their conclusion. Even the expected, sad ending, does not really make one feel sad or sorry. It's so matter of fact that you wonder why other films are not the same way. A killer who is obsessed with the way of the Samurai, seeks to avenge the death of his friends (pigeons), and also owes his current Master, his life. Situations get very complicated, and he ends up getting tied down by the weaknesses of the cowardly mobsters. Of course you should see the whole movie to understand what's being said in the reviews.

This follows a modern day hitman who acts according to ancient Japanese/Samurai principles. He is double crossed by the mafia bosses who hire him and his enacts his vengeance according to the same strict moral code. This is inter-cut throughout with passages from the Hagukure which gives an insight into the mindset of Ghost Dog and why he behaves as he does. This has a `made for TV' quality about it and the only big name is Forest Whitaker himself. The mob guys come across as clich&eacute;d stereotypes who use stock phrases and mafia style names, but this is a minor issue and mainly serves to highlight that they are a parody of themselves throughout. This has gained minor cult status over the years and it is a fine film, it wasn't as great as I'd anticipated and it was a very slow starter, but it has a good enough story and kept me watching to the end. I wasn't kept on the edge of my seat and I didn't feel much tension, but I liked the idea of a modern hitman acting on ancient principles and this aspect was carried out very well.

If you try to comfortably sit it in a box; action, comedy, drama, gangster flick, philosphical discourse, you will immediately have problems with this film. It is all of these, and none of these. It also defys some logic. It's a brilliant movie, but since it has a hard time being categorized, you'll probably see mainstream moviegoers, or people with an inability to think or view things abstractly or on different levels not liking it. It's a gutsy move, and one that is terribly lacking in an industry that usually rehashes old formulas.Most pressing is the assassin's relationships with his mafioso boss (retainer) and also with his best friend.

Their world was punctuated by low gradetelevision cartoons in the way Dog's was by Samurai philosophy.They were so goofy and idiotic that they became comic relief.The film would have been so much better had theItalians been taken seriously.Therein lies the primary problem that I hadwith the movie. It was certainly racist in intent.All of the white people in the movie were so stupidand destructive that it was better for them to be dead.There is one scene that I don't want to spoil by describingcompletely. It was very strange, apparently completelydisconnected from the plot, and the type of scene that oneusually finds in a special feature. Dog cruises in his slickride, dressed in a stylish suit, along a dirt road in the woodsand comes upon two ""white"" guys in camo who had justkilled a big black bear. Get it? Well, if you are a little slowon the uptake you need only recall that Dog's friend thinksof Dog as a bear. This scene must be very important for thevery reason that it seems disconnected.Ghost Dog is not a nice guy.He a murderer for hire and a thief,but we are lead to believe, as he does,that somehow it is alright because he livesaccording some ancient code in a little book.A gentle, intellectual, remorseless mass-murderer.Whitey probably made him that way.Too bad he didn't find a different little book.What I liked a lot about this movie was the pacing,the relationships he had with the ice-cream guy,the little girl and the dog, the bird's-eye viewpoints,the score and the mystical nature of the Ghostpart of Dog's persona.Ghost could hide in broad daylight, move amongst peopleunnoticed unless they were soul-mates,even steal the license plate off a car with a clear line of siteto the owners of the car sitting nearby at a picnic table,indicating a sort of divine (or diabolical) providence at work.The pacing was slow and steady.Nobody moved too fast.Everyone seemed resigned to the fickle finger of fate.Dog himself always walked and moved as if he had bricksstrapped to his shoes, even when practicing his martial arts.There were long, but not too long, lingering close-upsof facial expressions, even of a dog, and they were great.The score was well suited to the imagesto achieve the appropriate mood.Dog's relationship with the ice cream man was great.Dog speaks English, the ice cream man speaks French,neither understands what the other is saying, but theyhave conversations and shared experiences.There's a man building a large boat on the roofof a tenement building,perhaps a symbol of the frustrated longingto be somewhere else, anywhere else,to have a different life, that,time and circumstances conspire againstand an attempt to keep that dream alive,at least in spirit.Definitely worth watching once, maybe twice.A unique and captivating dream that you are drawn into.When it ends, it is like waking up.",3,Existential Waking Dream,1313366400,"08 15,

I thought I'd be dissapointed, but after viewing the movie, it became one of my favorites.Set in New Jersey, a black man who lives as a 20th century samurai is called on by a gangster. Ultimately, something goes bad and the samurai-ish hitman becomes the target.Sounds pretty cheasy, but it's not. The gangsters are portrayed very accurately. No ponytail clad pretty boys with Armani suits and Uzis. No, it's actually more like the Sopranos in that regard.And the protagonist, this black ninja, isn't the guy you'd normally expect for the role. What you get is an overweight Forrest Whitacker(sp)who, albeit awkward looking, really fits the character he portrays and adds a bit more dignity to the film in doing so.If you like action movies that are actually driven by a story and filled with gritty realism, pick this one up. If you like mob movies that aren't the typical B-grade fare, pick this up. And if you've like Leon or The Professional, this one might be right up your alley.

I found it hard to describe for friends in terms of genres; it moves far too slow for an action movie, too much violence and death for a character study; further confused by infrequent touches of comic genius;  it comes off on the surface as a pastiche of beautiful images weaved in and out with passages from the _Hakagure_ (Way of the Samurai) but it is also highly-structured and very deliberate.  Some of the scenes are simply amazing; for example, the training scene with Forest Whittaker on the rooftops practicing kendo and knifeplay in slow-mo is a superb adrenalin rush;  I also liked the shots of Ghost Dog's bird travelling over the city backed with RZA's sparse rhythm tracks.  And the way death is handled in this film is amazing - no dramatic flourishes or overacting, just death, raw, sudden and surprisingly businesslike.  The cast is nearly picture-perfect - I especially like Henry Silva as a steely-faced mobster.  And Whittaker has this amazing countenance which does absolute justice to the futile, insane, yet strangely balanced Ghost Dog character.  One moment he's a steely-eyed sniper coldly hunting his target from afar, and then a sparrow flutters, landing on his rifle and blocking his view, and he stops to admire the bird and smiles in gentle affection for nature.  This is the paradox of this film in a nutshell. Its not visceral but it is mind-blowing if you open up.  Its a movie that demands multiple viewings and patience.

I think the movie is pretty much just worth the rent, and I rented it. Overall I liked the action, I wish Ghost Dog would have used his sword that would be been some tight stuff, but the gun was good enough. He was ruthless, and did what had to be done. I thought that it was also a good add to the movie by having a mob in their, to give a different twist to it and it did that well. One of my favorite parts of the movie is when Ghost Dog shoots the guy throught the sink, that was some crazy stuff! One of the good stuff also was the music, when he was playin Killah Priest in his car, keepin it Hip-Hop!!!Its hard to say whether I recommend this movie or not, I mean its the type of movie either you DO like or you DONT like.
