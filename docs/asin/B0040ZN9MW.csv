1379723,A1DB4U8ISVULVE,B0040ZN9MW,Bill Smith,"[1, 2]","Just ask Steve Bartman. The true nature of Cub Fan is revealed in this step by step analysis of one of the ugliest moments in sports history. Cub fans turn on one of their own, jeering, heckling, throwing things at the poor defenseless Bartman as he sits dumbfounded after his goat like foul ball catch attempt. You hear Cub fans shouting expletives and threatening death to a fellow Cub fan until he has to be escorted out of the park by security for his own protection, hiding as he is pelted by more stuff and beer on his way out, eventually requiring round the clock police protection at his residence. The documentary then reveals that because of this one game, Bartman has had to go into seclusion and hiding in his own city for his own safety. The documentary also reveals the complete meltdown of the Cubs in that Game 6 as they blow a 3-0 lead in the 8th, with just 4 outs to go to their first World Series since 1945 had the foul ball been caught by Alou, only to lose 8-3; and then they go on to lose Game 7 the next day, after again taking the lead.The threats and invective rage against Bartman became so intense in the aftermath that the Illinois governor suggested he join the witness protection program and Florida Governor Jeb Bush offered him asylum in the State of Florida.The great irony of this whole escapade is that Cub fans, convinced that they have been victims of ""bad luck"" due to uncontrollable outside forces since 1908 (Billy Goat curses, black cats etc) ultimately turned on one of their OWN diehard fans as the cause of this meltdown on the field. At least Red Sox fans myopically placed all the blame on a PLAYER who actually misplayed an easy grounder (Buckner), as the parallel is drawn in the documentary. Thus in essence, Cubs fans are blaming themselves for over 100 years of Cubs futility, which, when you really think about it, is truly chuckle inducing.",5,"""The Friendly Confines"" aren't so friendly............",1373932800,"07 16, 2013",2013,1894,"['Just', 'ask', 'Steve', 'Bartman', 'true', 'nature', 'Cub', 'Fan', 'revealed', 'step', 'step', 'analysis', 'one', 'ugliest', 'moments', 'sports', 'history', 'Cub', 'fans', 'turn', 'one', 'own', 'jeering', 'heckling', 'throwing', 'things', 'poor', 'defenseless', 'Bartman', 'dumbfounded', 'goat', 'foul', 'ball', 'catch', 'attempt', 'hear', 'Cub', 'fans', 'shouting', 'expletives', 'threatening', 'death', 'fellow', 'Cub', 'fan', 'be', 'escorted', 'park', 'security', 'own', 'protection', 'hiding', 'pelted', 'more', 'stuff', 'beer', 'way', 'eventually', 'requiring', 'clock', 'police', 'protection', 'residence', 'documentary', 'then', 'one', 'game', 'Bartman', 'had', 'go', 'seclusion', 'hiding', 'own', 'city', 'own', 'safety', 'documentary', 'also', 'complete', 'meltdown', 'Cubs', 'Game', '6', 'blow', '3-0', 'lead', '8th', 'just', '4', 'outs', 'go', 'first', 'World', 'Series', '1945', 'had', 'foul', 'ball', 'been', 'caught', 'Alou', 'only', 'lose', '8-3', 'then', 'go', 'lose', 'Game', '7', 'next', 'day', 'again', 'taking', 'lead.The', 'threats', 'invective', 'rage', 'Bartman', 'became', 'so', 'intense', 'aftermath', 'Illinois', 'governor', 'suggested', 'join', 'witness', 'protection', 'program', 'Florida', 'Governor', 'Jeb', 'Bush', 'offered', 'asylum', 'State', 'Florida.The', 'great', 'irony', 'whole', 'escapade', 'Cub', 'fans', 'convinced', 'have', 'been', 'victims', 'bad', 'luck', 'due', 'uncontrollable', 'outside', 'forces', '1908', 'Billy', 'Goat', 'black', 'cats', 'etc', 'ultimately', 'turned', 'one', 'OWN', 'diehard', 'fans', 'cause', 'meltdown', 'field', 'least', 'Red', 'Sox', 'fans', 'myopically', 'placed', 'blame', 'PLAYER', 'who', 'actually', 'misplayed', 'easy', 'grounder', 'Buckner', 'parallel', 'drawn', 'documentary', 'Thus', 'essence', 'Cubs', 'fans', 'are', 'blaming', '100', 'years', 'Cubs', 'futility', 'when', 'really', 'think', 'truly', 'chuckle', 'inducing']",N/A
1379724,A1TJIJKKN15KR9,B0040ZN9MW,drqshadow,"[3, 3]","The oft-delayed ""lost chapter"" of ESPN's 30 for 30 series, this strives to be more than just a routine examination of the infamous Steve Bartman incident that may (or may not) have cost the Chicago Cubs a shot at the 2003 World Series. With the famously publicity-shy Bartman refusing to take part, the film instead leans on interviews with several of the fans to rub elbows with him that fateful evening and insightful confessionals from the announce crew that called the game, a good portion of the Cubs' starting lineup, the local news team that outed Bartman's identity to the public and several of the security guards that escorted him to safety as the situation escalated. Director Alex Gibney deserves credit for not only painting a broad, fair portrait of a chaotic, emotionally charged situation, but for rightly comparing it to other instances of misplaced blame and shameless scapegoating in pro sports and asking the difficult question of what exactly spins a knee-jerk reaction into a bonafide vendetta. Though the scrutiny of the Bartman play itself is a bit too intense at times, resulting in a run-time that's about 30 minutes too long, it accomplishes much more than a simple reenactment and should leave any serious sports fan wondering how many times they've reacted with the same brainless mob mentality over the years.

It is also one of my top 5 movies of 2011 --along with ""Moneyball"".Alex Gibney may be America's top documentary film-maker & his talent is on full diplay in this fascinating look at 2 recent ""goats"" in American sports. Bill Buckner's infamous gaffe in the World Series is explored here along with the target that was painted on Steve Bartman's chest by various entities when he may or may not have cost the Cubbies their 1st WS appearance in decades.Buckner speaks very movingly about what he & his family have gone through since his error. Your admiration for him can't help but to grow as you listen & watch him talk. (I've been a Buckner fan since his days with the Dodgers).Buckner made himself available to Gibney, but Bartman didn't. This makes Gibney's exlporation what happened that night in Wrigley much more difficult to tell. However Bartman's personal absence is treated as perhaps a smart move by him & makes him an even more fascinating character -- a J.D. Salinger of baseball lore if you will. The flight of that fated foul ball is given all the study of a police shooting review (I'm tempted to compare the attention given to the Zapruder film but I don't want to compare a baseball game to a presidential asassination.) Some people may find all this analysis a bit much, but it allows for other players to emerge for better & for worse. Bartman comes off as a really good guy & every bit an enigma.The extras on the DVD are well worth checking out as well.",5,Another excellent Gibney documentary.,1331510400,"03 12, 2012",2012,1566,"[""'re"", 'baseball', 'fan', 'MUST', 'SEE', 'movie', 'equally', 'excellent', 'Moneyball', 'also', 'one', 'top', '5', 'movies', '2011', 'Moneyball', '.Alex', 'Gibney', 'may', 'be', 'America', 'top', 'documentary', 'film-maker', 'talent', 'full', 'diplay', 'fascinating', 'look', '2', 'recent', 'goats', 'American', 'sports', 'Bill', 'Buckner', 'infamous', 'gaffe', 'World', 'Series', 'explored', 'here', 'along', 'target', 'was', 'painted', 'Steve', 'Bartman', 'chest', 'various', 'entities', 'when', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'cost', 'Cubbies', '1st', 'WS', 'appearance', 'decades.Buckner', 'speaks', 'very', 'movingly', 'what', 'family', 'have', 'gone', 'error', 'admiration', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'grow', 'listen', 'watch', 'talk', ""'ve"", 'been', 'Buckner', 'fan', 'days', 'Dodgers', '.Buckner', 'made', 'available', 'Gibney', 'Bartman', 'did', ""n't"", 'Gibney', 'exlporation', 'what', 'happened', 'night', 'Wrigley', 'much', 'more', 'difficult', 'tell', 'However', 'Bartman', 'personal', 'absence', 'treated', 'perhaps', 'smart', 'move', 'even', 'more', 'fascinating', 'character', 'J.D', 'Salinger', 'baseball', 'lore', 'will', 'flight', 'fated', 'foul', 'ball', 'given', 'study', 'police', 'shooting', 'review', ""'m"", 'tempted', 'compare', 'attention', 'given', 'Zapruder', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'compare', 'baseball', 'game', 'presidential', 'asassination', 'people', 'may', 'find', 'analysis', 'bit', 'much', 'other', 'players', 'emerge', 'better', 'worse', 'Bartman', 'off', 'really', 'good', 'guy', 'bit', 'enigma.The', 'extras', 'DVD', 'are', 'well', 'checking', 'out', 'as', 'well']",N/A
1379728,A1K714PEGLE3MV,B0040ZN9MW,Jon Oye,"[4, 4]","What a fascinating, if sometimes frightening and unnerving, journey into the darker side of sports fanaticism this film is, via an innocent, isolated incident that incurred the wrath of nearly an entire fan base - never mind the fact that it could have happened to any one member of that fan base.Wrigley Field has affectionately, if cloyingly, been called the ""Friendly Confines"" since the days when Jack Brickhouse manned the broadcast booth and called games for the Chicago Cubs on radio and television, but this film almost makes one think twice about attending a baseball game within its ivy-covered walls. The uneasy realization that perfect storm circumstances can suddenly turn inhabitants of packed stands into an angry mob, as shown in network and home video in this presentation, shakes one to the core. This engrossing film explores all aspects of the infamous Steve Bartman incident, which took place during Game Six of the 2003 NLCS, when the Cubs were six outs away from defeating the then-Florida Marlins and advancing to a coveted World Series berth for the first time in several generations of long-suffering Wrigley faithful. Interviews with fans, writers, TV announcers, Wrigley Field security personnel, and players from both sides enrich this exploration of the collective psyche of sports fanatics gone ballistic.The inclusion of a Boston Red Sox correlative appears to have provided a bone of contention among some Amazon reviewers. I can say that, despite the overabundance of Red Sox-oriented drivel that's most certainly circulating out there, this film actually benefits from the addition of a shared Boston perspective. The similarities in the ways Bartman and 1986 Boston first baseman Bill Buckner became whipping boys for the fans from their respective ""nations"" (Bartman being a Cub fan) are undeniable. It makes perfect sense to include the Sox side-story: both Buckner and Bartman were unfairly singled out for the failure of a team to close the deal in a game six. Both were unfairly branded and chastised as embodiments of imagined curses which were supposedly cast upon these storied franchises, purportedly causing each of them to go without winning a championship in several decades (in the case of the Cubs, more than a lifetime).Most folks forget that the damage had already been done prior to the Buckner incident, that the game was in fact already tied thanks to a series of Mets singles and a wild pitch. And Mookie Wilson attests that he would have beaten the aged, bad-kneed Buckner (a former Cub, by the way) to first base even if Buckner had fielded the ball cleanly. Video of the play bears him out. Similarly, Bartman had little to do with the Cubs' group implosion of October `03, all of which happened on the field in most dramatic fashion, including a costly infield error and, also mirroring the Boston collapse, a wild pitch. And can we really assume that left fielder Moises Alou would have caught that foul ball if Bartman hadn't touched it? As in life, there are no guarantees in baseball, and stranger things have happened in this venerable old game than a semi-competent fielder not making what may or may not have been a sure catch. Who would have been the scapegoat then?If anything, the Buckner correlation makes ""Catching Hell"" interesting to a wider audience than just Cub fans, who by the way should be thankful to Mr. Gibney for this; if the content were limited solely to the carryings-on of Cubbies loyalists, the ugliness of sports fans at their absolute worst would be associated only with them in this film. They would, in fact, be more likely to become scapegoats of sports fandom in general, much like Bartman became their scapegoat for Cubs futility. Thanks to the added Boston angle in this film, the darkness that envelops bitter fans' hearts is spread around a little.",5,Engrossing Exploration of Sports Fans' Darker Side,1350950400,"10 23, 2012",2012,3847,"['What', 'fascinating', 'sometimes', 'frightening', 'unnerving', 'journey', 'darker', 'side', 'sports', 'fanaticism', 'film', 'innocent', 'isolated', 'incident', 'incurred', 'wrath', 'nearly', 'entire', 'fan', 'base', 'never', 'mind', 'fact', 'could', 'have', 'happened', 'one', 'member', 'fan', 'base.Wrigley', 'Field', 'affectionately', 'cloyingly', 'been', 'called', 'Friendly', 'Confines', 'days', 'when', 'Jack', 'Brickhouse', 'manned', 'broadcast', 'booth', 'called', 'games', 'Chicago', 'Cubs', 'radio', 'television', 'film', 'almost', 'one', 'think', 'twice', 'attending', 'baseball', 'game', 'ivy-covered', 'walls', 'uneasy', 'realization', 'perfect', 'storm', 'circumstances', 'can', 'suddenly', 'turn', 'inhabitants', 'packed', 'stands', 'angry', 'mob', 'shown', 'network', 'home', 'video', 'presentation', 'one', 'core', 'engrossing', 'film', 'aspects', 'infamous', 'Steve', 'Bartman', 'incident', 'took', 'place', 'Game', 'Six', '2003', 'NLCS', 'when', 'Cubs', 'were', 'six', 'outs', 'away', 'defeating', 'then-Florida', 'Marlins', 'advancing', 'coveted', 'World', 'Series', 'berth', 'first', 'time', 'several', 'generations', 'long-suffering', 'Wrigley', 'faithful', 'Interviews', 'fans', 'writers', 'TV', 'announcers', 'Wrigley', 'Field', 'security', 'personnel', 'players', 'sides', 'enrich', 'exploration', 'collective', 'psyche', 'sports', 'fanatics', 'gone', 'ballistic.The', 'inclusion', 'Boston', 'Red', 'Sox', 'correlative', 'have', 'provided', 'bone', 'contention', 'Amazon', 'reviewers', 'can', 'say', 'overabundance', 'Red', 'Sox-oriented', 'drivel', 'most', 'certainly', 'circulating', 'there', 'film', 'actually', 'benefits', 'addition', 'shared', 'Boston', 'perspective', 'similarities', 'ways', 'Bartman', '1986', 'Boston', 'first', 'baseman', 'Bill', 'Buckner', 'became', 'whipping', 'boys', 'fans', 'respective', 'nations', 'Bartman', 'being', 'Cub', 'fan', 'are', 'undeniable', 'perfect', 'sense', 'include', 'Sox', 'side-story', 'Buckner', 'Bartman', 'were', 'unfairly', 'singled', 'out', 'failure', 'team', 'close', 'deal', 'game', 'six', 'were', 'unfairly', 'branded', 'chastised', 'embodiments', 'imagined', 'curses', 'were', 'supposedly', 'cast', 'storied', 'franchises', 'purportedly', 'causing', 'go', 'winning', 'championship', 'several', 'decades', 'case', 'Cubs', 'more', 'lifetime', '.Most', 'folks', 'forget', 'damage', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'done', 'prior', 'Buckner', 'incident', 'game', 'was', 'fact', 'already', 'tied', 'thanks', 'series', 'Mets', 'singles', 'wild', 'pitch', 'Mookie', 'Wilson', 'would', 'have', 'beaten', 'aged', 'bad-kneed', 'Buckner', 'former', 'Cub', 'way', 'first', 'base', 'even', 'Buckner', 'had', 'fielded', 'ball', 'cleanly', 'Video', 'play', 'out', 'Similarly', 'Bartman', 'had', 'little', 'do', 'Cubs', 'group', 'implosion', 'October', '03', 'happened', 'field', 'most', 'dramatic', 'fashion', 'including', 'costly', 'infield', 'error', 'also', 'mirroring', 'Boston', 'collapse', 'wild', 'pitch', 'can', 'really', 'assume', 'left', 'fielder', 'Moises', 'Alou', 'would', 'have', 'caught', 'foul', 'ball', 'Bartman', 'had', ""n't"", 'touched', 'life', 'are', 'guarantees', 'baseball', 'stranger', 'things', 'have', 'happened', 'venerable', 'old', 'game', 'semi-competent', 'fielder', 'not', 'making', 'what', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'sure', 'catch', 'Who', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'scapegoat', 'then', 'anything', 'Buckner', 'correlation', 'Catching', 'Hell', 'interesting', 'wider', 'audience', 'just', 'Cub', 'fans', 'who', 'way', 'should', 'be', 'thankful', 'Mr.', 'Gibney', 'content', 'were', 'limited', 'solely', 'carryings-on', 'Cubbies', 'loyalists', 'ugliness', 'sports', 'fans', 'absolute', 'worst', 'would', 'be', 'associated', 'only', 'film', 'would', 'fact', 'be', 'more', 'likely', 'become', 'scapegoats', 'sports', 'fandom', 'general', 'much', 'Bartman', 'became', 'scapegoat', 'Cubs', 'futility', 'Thanks', 'added', 'Boston', 'angle', 'film', 'darkness', 'bitter', 'fans', 'hearts', 'spread', 'little']",N/A
1379729,A1I9B4PSCDDWOO,B0040ZN9MW,"lordhoot ""lordhoot""","[7, 8]","I am a Boston Red Sox fan so I can understand how the Cubs fans felt back then. This documentary I thought, was well presented and the entire premise lies around how Steve Bartman become the scapegoat for the Chicago Cubs when they lost that NLCS series. Since the fans cannot cussed out their favorite players on the team, they found someone they can and that someone was Steve Bartman.I found the documentary interesting because it shows how in one unthinking instinctive moment, one life was totally ruined in a baseball game. It was made worst thanks to the media who kept hyping it up and emotional Cubs fans who needed someone to blame beside their beloved Cubs. That is amazing. It is totally amazing as the documentary shows that Steve Bartman took every Cubs player and their coaches off the hook for their terrible failure to win that series at home. You would think that they owed Steve Bartman a vote of thanks for taking all the heat off their back!! The documentary skillfully used the scapegoat analogy but it was more then that. Bartman was clearly the whipping boy for Cubs' failure. He took the lash for every one of the Cubs mistakes, failures and strikeouts of that series after that incident. Every hit Kerry Wood gave up in the seventh game was Bartman's fault. Every hit the Marlin had was Bartman's fault. Every time a Cub player strike out or grounded out, it was Bartman's fault. Lashes were coming down hard on that poor guy's back while the Cubs players got off scot free.Sad thing was as the documentary clearly show, Bartman was doing what anyone of us would have done if we were there at that spot.I thought the documentary making comparsion with the fate of Bill Buckner was very proper. Buckner was the scapegoat, the whipping boy for the Red Sox fans and media for that one monumental error in the World Series. The major difference was, Buckner was a professional, he was paid good money to make that play and failed so what he got, no matter how unjust it was, came with the territory while Bartman was just a fan who flatlined it for a brief moment of his life and that cost him.Maybe it was the curse of the Billy Goat that took control of Bartman that night. I am sure it the Curse of the Bambino that forced the error by Buckner. As a Red Sox fan and a minority on this, I did not blame Buckner even although I was teased for the next 18 years with ""between the legs"" jokes. What human can fight a curse, eh? But Buckner wasn't forgiven until the Red Sox won the World Series...twice!! Chances are, Mr. Bartman may remain infamous to many die-hard Cubs fans until they do the same, at least making it to the World Series should count!! Then maybe they may let Mr. Bartman throw out the first pitch or something. Maybe panda bears might learn how to fly too, eh?Excellent documentary that need to be view by every single baseball fan out there. It is also an interesting study on how quickly you can be cut out of the herd and laid out for sacrifice by the mob.",5,Excellent and pretty insightful,1317772800,"10 5, 2011",2011,3000,"['am', 'Boston', 'Red', 'Sox', 'fan', 'so', 'can', 'understand', 'how', 'Cubs', 'fans', 'felt', 'back', 'then', 'documentary', 'thought', 'was', 'well', 'presented', 'entire', 'premise', 'how', 'Steve', 'Bartman', 'become', 'scapegoat', 'Chicago', 'Cubs', 'when', 'lost', 'NLCS', 'series', 'fans', 'can', 'not', 'cussed', 'out', 'favorite', 'players', 'team', 'found', 'someone', 'can', 'someone', 'was', 'Steve', 'Bartman.I', 'found', 'documentary', 'interesting', 'how', 'one', 'unthinking', 'instinctive', 'moment', 'one', 'life', 'was', 'totally', 'ruined', 'baseball', 'game', 'was', 'made', 'worst', 'thanks', 'media', 'who', 'kept', 'hyping', 'emotional', 'Cubs', 'fans', 'who', 'needed', 'someone', 'blame', 'beside', 'beloved', 'Cubs', 'amazing', 'totally', 'amazing', 'documentary', 'Steve', 'Bartman', 'took', 'Cubs', 'player', 'coaches', 'hook', 'terrible', 'failure', 'win', 'series', 'home', 'would', 'think', 'owed', 'Steve', 'Bartman', 'vote', 'thanks', 'taking', 'heat', 'off', 'back', 'documentary', 'skillfully', 'used', 'scapegoat', 'analogy', 'was', 'more', 'then', 'Bartman', 'was', 'clearly', 'whipping', 'boy', 'Cubs', 'failure', 'took', 'lash', 'one', 'Cubs', 'mistakes', 'failures', 'strikeouts', 'series', 'incident', 'hit', 'Kerry', 'Wood', 'gave', 'up', 'seventh', 'game', 'was', 'Bartman', 'fault', 'hit', 'Marlin', 'had', 'was', 'Bartman', 'fault', 'time', 'Cub', 'player', 'strike', 'grounded', 'out', 'was', 'Bartman', 'fault', 'Lashes', 'were', 'coming', 'down', 'hard', 'poor', 'guy', 'back', 'Cubs', 'players', 'got', 'off', 'scot', 'free.Sad', 'thing', 'was', 'documentary', 'clearly', 'show', 'Bartman', 'was', 'doing', 'what', 'anyone', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'were', 'there', 'spot.I', 'thought', 'documentary', 'making', 'comparsion', 'fate', 'Bill', 'Buckner', 'was', 'very', 'proper', 'Buckner', 'was', 'scapegoat', 'whipping', 'boy', 'Red', 'Sox', 'fans', 'media', 'one', 'monumental', 'error', 'World', 'Series', 'major', 'difference', 'was', 'Buckner', 'was', 'professional', 'was', 'paid', 'good', 'money', 'make', 'play', 'failed', 'so', 'what', 'got', 'matter', 'how', 'unjust', 'was', 'came', 'territory', 'Bartman', 'was', 'just', 'fan', 'who', 'flatlined', 'brief', 'moment', 'life', 'cost', 'him.Maybe', 'was', 'curse', 'Billy', 'Goat', 'took', 'control', 'Bartman', 'night', 'am', 'sure', 'Curse', 'Bambino', 'forced', 'error', 'Buckner', 'Red', 'Sox', 'fan', 'minority', 'did', 'not', 'blame', 'Buckner', 'even', 'was', 'teased', 'next', '18', 'years', 'legs', 'jokes', 'What', 'human', 'can', 'fight', 'curse', 'eh', 'Buckner', 'was', ""n't"", 'forgiven', 'Red', 'Sox', 'won', 'World', 'Series', 'twice', 'Chances', 'are', 'Mr.', 'Bartman', 'may', 'remain', 'infamous', 'many', 'die-hard', 'Cubs', 'fans', 'do', 'same', 'least', 'making', 'World', 'Series', 'should', 'count', 'Then', 'maybe', 'may', 'let', 'Mr.', 'Bartman', 'out', 'first', 'pitch', 'something', 'Maybe', 'panda', 'bears', 'might', 'learn', 'how', 'fly', 'too', 'eh', 'Excellent', 'documentary', 'need', 'be', 'view', 'single', 'baseball', 'fan', 'there', 'also', 'interesting', 'study', 'how', 'quickly', 'can', 'be', 'cut', 'herd', 'laid', 'out', 'sacrifice', 'mob']",N/A
