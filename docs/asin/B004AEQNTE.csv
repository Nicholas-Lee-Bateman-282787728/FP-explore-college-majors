I like that she shows the moves in each segment one at a time then puts them together then shows another part then adds that until you have an entire routine THEN she goes through it a few times altogether to reinforce them.  I don't have a dance background so it is more difficult for me to remember what follows what but she cues very well.  My husband likes this DVD because he needs abdominal work but has a hard time exercising in a prone position  because of vertigo.  Even if we can't do them perfectly we are moving and trying our best.  AND IT IS FUN!,5,So much FUN!

It was my first experience with the 10 minute solutions series and I found it so easy to use that I started trying more of them.  What I like about the 10 minute videos is that it feels like you're done really quickly, even if you do 3-4 because each seem totally different due to the instructor wearing different outfits and there's a short warm up and cool down for each one. You sort of trick yourself into thinking that it was really fast so you keep on going. But if you don't, studies have shown that even 10 minutes help! One thing I've found with this particular video is that certain steps focus on only one side, so I just try doing the opposite side for a few of the reps-working the brain as well!  I like the instructor and the moves-she's positive and the moves are easy to follow.  I would not say the moves are ridiculous as a previous reviewer stated, but they are somewhat like the ""light hits"" on certain radio stations vs. the rock stations. :) It came with a weight belt too.  I haven't tried using it with other videos but I don't know why it couldn't be used with them as well.  All in all it is a workout I return to on a regular basis.",4,"Fun, easy, quick!",1352419200,"11 9, 2012",2012,1188,"['really', 'liked', 'video', 'was', 'first', 'experience', '10', 'minute', 'solutions', 'series', 'found', 'so', 'easy', 'use', 'started', 'trying', 'more', 'What', 'like', '10', 'minute', 'videos', ""'re"", 'done', 'really', 'quickly', 'even', 'do', '3-4', 'seem', 'totally', 'different', 'due', 'instructor', 'wearing', 'different', 'outfits', 'short', 'warm', 'up', 'cool', 'down', 'one', 'sort', 'trick', 'thinking', 'was', 'really', 'fast', 'keep', 'going', 'do', ""n't"", 'studies', 'have', 'shown', 'even', '10', 'minutes', 'help', 'One', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'found', 'particular', 'video', 'certain', 'steps', 'focus', 'only', 'one', 'side', 'just', 'try', 'doing', 'opposite', 'side', 'few', 'reps-working', 'brain', 'as', 'well', 'instructor', 'moves-she', 'positive', 'moves', 'are', 'easy', 'follow', 'would', 'not', 'say', 'moves', 'are', 'ridiculous', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'stated', 'are', 'somewhat', 'light', 'hits', 'certain', 'radio', 'stations', 'rock', 'stations', 'came', 'weight', 'belt', 'too', 'have', ""n't"", 'tried', 'using', 'other', 'videos', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'used', 'as', 'well', 'workout', 'return', 'regular', 'basis']",N/A

I was excited for Dance Your Body Thin, as I LOVE to dance and HATE to exercise. Boy, was I disappointed. The instructor is adorable and high energy, but the moves are ridiculous. I felt so silly that I couldn't even finish half the moves without busting out laughing. Not for me. I'll stick with Jennifer Galardi for my dance workouts.",2,Silly,1304812800,"05 8, 2011",2011,442,"['So', 'far', ""'m"", 'loving', '10', 'Minute', 'Solutions', 'Quick', 'easy', 'workouts', 'allow', 'customize', 'own', 'fitness', 'was', 'excited', 'Dance', 'Your', 'Body', 'Thin', 'LOVE', 'dance', 'HATE', 'exercise', 'Boy', 'was', 'disappointed', 'instructor', 'adorable', 'high', 'energy', 'moves', 'are', 'ridiculous', 'felt', 'so', 'silly', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'finish', 'moves', 'busting', 'out', 'laughing', 'Not', ""'ll"", 'stick', 'Jennifer', 'Galardi', 'dance', 'workouts']",N/A
