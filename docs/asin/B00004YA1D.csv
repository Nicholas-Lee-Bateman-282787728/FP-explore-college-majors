The last demon in the movie didnt look very scary. i think that they should have used some special effects to make his eyes glow or burn or something to make him look more scary. it was pretty obvious it was a person inside. i know theres no such thing as a demon, but they could have at least tried to make it LOOK real. i didnt like the ""cheap"" way they ended the movie. instead of the actors acting out the ending scene.. instead it is written and the viewer has to READ the complete ending. i watched this movie with my parents cuz i didnt think it had nudity. running into TRICK horror movie covers in the 90s, i didnt think the cover would give as promised. if u are experienced with 1980 horror flicks, then you can tell that the cover of this vhs tape, had nudity in it. they had some really good looking girls here too. at the beginning, this movie was more funny than scary for the first.. 10 mins of the movie. i think it has a little bit of everything. and based on the reviews i seen on amazon, i have to tell one thing to most of the reviewers that say bad things about movies with even just one scene of nudity. i dont see ANYTHING wrong about having nudity in a movie. i cant understand how nudity can make a movie horrible",4,GOOD MOVIE! but not great,1097798400,"10 15, 2004",2004,1365,"['1980', 'horror', 'film', 'type', 'oppossed', '1990', '2000s', 'i', 'think', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'last', 'demon', 'movie', 'didnt', 'look', 'very', 'scary', 'i', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'used', 'special', 'effects', 'make', 'eyes', 'glow', 'burn', 'something', 'make', 'look', 'more', 'scary', 'was', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'was', 'person', 'i', 'know', 'such', 'thing', 'demon', 'could', 'have', 'least', 'tried', 'make', 'LOOK', 'real', 'i', 'didnt', 'cheap', 'way', 'ended', 'movie', 'instead', 'actors', 'acting', 'out', 'ending', 'scene..', 'instead', 'written', 'viewer', 'READ', 'complete', 'ending', 'i', 'watched', 'movie', 'parents', 'cuz', 'i', 'didnt', 'think', 'had', 'nudity', 'running', 'TRICK', 'horror', 'movie', '90s', 'i', 'didnt', 'think', 'cover', 'would', 'give', 'promised', 'u', 'are', 'experienced', '1980', 'horror', 'flicks', 'then', 'can', 'tell', 'cover', 'vhs', 'tape', 'had', 'nudity', 'had', 'really', 'good', 'looking', 'girls', 'here', 'too', 'beginning', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'funny', 'scary', 'first..', '10', 'mins', 'movie', 'i', 'think', 'little', 'bit', 'everything', 'based', 'reviews', 'i', 'seen', 'amazon', 'i', 'have', 'tell', 'one', 'thing', 'most', 'reviewers', 'say', 'bad', 'things', 'movies', 'even', 'just', 'one', 'scene', 'nudity', 'i', 'dont', 'see', 'ANYTHING', 'wrong', 'having', 'nudity', 'movie', 'i', 'cant', 'understand', 'how', 'nudity', 'can', 'make', 'movie', 'horrible']",N/A

Roy Scheider must have been on vacation and decided he needed some extra spending money.  Scheider's worst performance, more than likely.  But he's not in it too much, and that leaves us with the likes of Don Maloney, Lauren Woodland, Christian Harmony and the howlingly funny Teresa DePriest.  Teresa plays a double role, first as the demon Elizabeth Van Buren, and then her psychic descendant Lydia.  Watching dePriest make demon faces while taunting Maloney is hilarious.  She looks like a little baby trying to make funny faces at mommy, it's very very funny.The script is not important; the sex scenes are obviously used as padding, and are about as erotic as celery and onions.

558830,ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,B00004YA1D,Micheal Hunt,"[1, 6]","Was this movie meant to be a joke? I'm not easily scared, but I do like a good horror flick. However, this was neither a horror or suspense film that I would even call B grade, I'd call it 7th grade for the fact that it looks like a 7th grade acting class has tried to make a movie.The acting was very poor. When you watch it, it's like.. how do I describe it, $#!% house! One second they're scared (characters), the next everything is ok, then they wanna leave but, no one seems to have the will power to act on their own! instead, it has to be a group desicion to leave, I wonder who holds whose hand when they go to the bathroom?Now, don't get me wrong, I don't mind bad special-effects, sometimes they really are corny and lame, but at least they're plausible... unlike the pathetic effects of this movie. A so called ""demon woman"" floats into the room and does nothing but smile and float at 1 mile per hour towards the students, then her fingernails grow in 3 frames and she howls pathetically doing the worst job of trying to act I think I've ever seen. I mean, just watch it if you wanna see what lame acting is. The so-called ""Doorway"" was so scary, I almost didn't realize my shoe-laces needed to be done up. It was a red light in a cupboard in the cellar... oh how scary. Then they bring in Rob Shnieder!!!!! I still can't believe he was in it... but I bet you won't hear him ever promote this movie, i'm sure he's too embarrassed to admit being in it, and his demise is lame, lame, lame, lame, lame, lame, lame. The only thing that looked like it had more then $10 spent on it was the fiery pit of hell that someone falls into for 2 seconds of the movie.Look, avoid the movie. I payed $2 for the movie out of the really, really, really cheap bin. And I still think I should demand my two whole dollars back for the wasted time I spent watching it and never getting those 2 hours back, they should understand my pain, and refund my $2 in 1 cent pieces and give me a discount for $20 off my next purchase.I wouldn't recommend you rent this, buy it, or watch it if it was on TV. I didn't even get through to finishing it before I ejected it and threw it in the bin. At least it was only pocket change I lost on this ...Grrrrr... I so badly wanna use naughty words to describe it but if I did this review completely in my own words there would just be a (...) for the whole thing where amazon have deleted parts of it.This movie is...Foxtrot Uniform Charlie Kilo India November GSierra Hotel India Tango",1,The Doorway,1116460800,"05 19, 2005",2005,2511,"['Was', 'movie', 'meant', 'be', 'joke', ""'m"", 'not', 'easily', 'scared', 'do', 'good', 'horror', 'flick', 'However', 'was', 'horror', 'suspense', 'film', 'would', 'even', 'call', 'B', 'grade', ""'d"", 'call', '7th', 'grade', 'fact', '7th', 'grade', 'acting', 'class', 'tried', 'make', 'movie.The', 'acting', 'was', 'very', 'poor', 'When', 'watch', 'like..', 'how', 'do', 'describe', '%', 'house', 'One', 'second', ""'re"", 'scared', 'characters', 'next', 'everything', 'ok', 'then', 'wan', 'na', 'leave', 'one', 'have', 'will', 'power', 'act', 'own', 'instead', 'be', 'group', 'desicion', 'leave', 'wonder', 'who', 'hand', 'when', 'go', 'bathroom', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'bad', 'special-effects', 'sometimes', 'really', 'are', 'corny', 'lame', 'least', ""'re"", 'plausible', 'pathetic', 'effects', 'movie', 'so', 'called', 'demon', 'woman', 'floats', 'room', 'nothing', 'smile', 'float', '1', 'mile', 'hour', 'students', 'then', 'fingernails', 'grow', '3', 'frames', 'pathetically', 'doing', 'worst', 'job', 'trying', 'act', 'think', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'mean', 'just', 'watch', 'wan', 'see', 'what', 'lame', 'acting', 'so-called', 'Doorway', 'was', 'so', 'scary', 'almost', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'shoe-laces', 'needed', 'be', 'done', 'up', 'was', 'red', 'light', 'cupboard', 'cellar', 'how', 'scary', 'Then', 'bring', 'Rob', 'Shnieder', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'was', 'bet', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hear', 'ever', 'promote', 'movie', 'i', ""'m"", 'sure', 'too', 'embarrassed', 'admit', 'being', 'demise', 'lame', 'lame', 'lame', 'lame', 'lame', 'lame', 'lame', 'only', 'thing', 'looked', 'had', 'more', 'then', '10', 'spent', 'was', 'fiery', 'pit', 'hell', 'someone', '2', 'seconds', 'movie.Look', 'avoid', 'movie', 'payed', '2', 'movie', 'really', 'really', 'really', 'cheap', 'bin', 'still', 'think', 'should', 'demand', 'two', 'whole', 'dollars', 'back', 'wasted', 'time', 'spent', 'watching', 'never', 'getting', '2', 'hours', 'back', 'should', 'understand', 'pain', 'refund', '2', '1', 'cent', 'pieces', 'give', 'discount', '20', 'next', 'purchase.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'rent', 'buy', 'watch', 'was', 'TV', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'finishing', 'ejected', 'threw', 'bin', 'least', 'was', 'only', 'pocket', 'change', 'lost', 'Grrrrr', 'so', 'badly', 'wan', 'use', 'naughty', 'words', 'describe', 'did', 'review', 'completely', 'own', 'words', 'there', 'would', 'just', 'be', 'whole', 'thing', 'where', 'amazon', 'have', 'deleted', 'parts', 'it.This', 'movie', 'Foxtrot', 'Uniform', 'Charlie', 'Kilo', 'India', 'November', 'GSierra', 'Hotel', 'India', 'Tango']",N/A
