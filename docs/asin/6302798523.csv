335834,A1N7YA81ZI4KAF,6302798523,"E. Valero ""Eterno""","[0, 0]","""Goin' to Town"" (1935) is probably one of my favorite films of Mae West. It contains her witty dialogue, her trademark ""purrrr's"" and most importantly, is very entertaining. West plays Cleo Borden. A temptress with a past who marries into the big leagues but despite having all the money in the world, she is shunned by most of high society and has a difficult time trying to swoon the man of her affections. There is a lot that happens in this film which is one of the reasons it's never boring. West flirts, becomes engaged, becomes a widow, travels to Argentina, flirts some more, marries, is framed, and is constantly feuding with the many men, including Edward Carrington (Paul Cavanagh), the man of her desire and an incredibly snobby and ruthless high society lady, Mrs. Crane Brittony played tremendously by Marjorie Gateson. Although this film was released when the strict production code was in effect, West delivers some extremely witty dialogue including one of my favorites:Cleo: ""Yeah, for a long time I was ashamed of the way I lived.""Man: ""You mean to tell me, you've reformed?""Cleo: ""No, I got over being ashamed.""Or the scene as she is trying to tell her not so intelligent male suitor that they are not right for each other:Cleo: Listen Ivan, you're alright to play around with but as a husband, you get in my hair..... Besides, we're intellectual opposites"".Ivan: ""What do you mean?""Cleo: ""Well I'm intellectual and you're opposite.""Another stand-out scene is her seduction of Carrington. The scene is not only funny:Cleo (to the stiff Carrington who is surprisingly rejecting her advances): ""What?.. are you afraid of me?""but also quite seductive:Carrington: ""You're a DANGEROUS woman""Cleo (in her trademark voice): ""Thanks. You look good to me too. Come here"" (SMOOCH)It's all in her delivery and the woman was a master at her craft.I purchased this VHS over a decade ago on Amazon (it took me 13 years to review it) but the film can be found in theMae West - The Glamour CollectionDVD set which includes 5 of her movies and is worth purchasing especially if you are a fan.Although the film is inferior to her outrageous and outstanding ""She Done Him Wrong"", ""Goin' to Town"" is still classic Mae West despite any cuts that may have resulted from the strict production code of the time. It is not often recognized as being her best film but for my money, it is one of her best and it stands up to repeated viewings.",4,Amusing Film Has the Queen of the Double Entendre Shocking High Society,1390435200,"01 23, 2014",2014,2436,"['Goin', 'Town', '1935', 'probably', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'Mae', 'West', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'trademark', 'purrrr', 'most', 'importantly', 'very', 'entertaining', 'West', 'Cleo', 'Borden', 'A', 'temptress', 'past', 'who', 'big', 'leagues', 'having', 'money', 'world', 'shunned', 'most', 'high', 'society', 'difficult', 'time', 'trying', 'swoon', 'man', 'affections', 'lot', 'film', 'one', 'reasons', 'never', 'boring', 'West', 'flirts', 'becomes', 'engaged', 'widow', 'travels', 'Argentina', 'more', 'marries', 'framed', 'constantly', 'feuding', 'many', 'men', 'including', 'Edward', 'Carrington', 'Paul', 'Cavanagh', 'man', 'desire', 'incredibly', 'snobby', 'ruthless', 'high', 'society', 'lady', 'Mrs.', 'Crane', 'Brittony', 'played', 'tremendously', 'Marjorie', 'Gateson', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'when', 'strict', 'production', 'code', 'was', 'effect', 'West', 'extremely', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'including', 'one', 'favorites', 'Cleo', 'Yeah', 'long', 'time', 'was', 'ashamed', 'way', 'lived', 'Man', 'mean', 'tell', ""'ve"", 'reformed', 'Cleo', 'No', 'got', 'being', 'ashamed', 'scene', 'trying', 'tell', 'not', 'so', 'intelligent', 'male', 'suitor', 'are', 'not', 'right', 'other', 'Cleo', 'Listen', 'Ivan', ""'re"", 'alright', 'play', 'around', 'husband', 'get', 'hair', '..', 'Besides', ""'re"", 'intellectual', 'opposites', '.Ivan', 'What', 'do', 'mean', 'Cleo', 'Well', ""'m"", 'intellectual', ""'re"", 'opposite', 'stand-out', 'scene', 'seduction', 'Carrington', 'scene', 'not', 'only', 'funny', 'Cleo', 'stiff', 'Carrington', 'who', 'surprisingly', 'rejecting', 'advances', 'What', '..', 'are', 'also', 'quite', 'seductive', 'Carrington', ""'re"", 'DANGEROUS', 'woman', 'Cleo', 'trademark', 'voice', 'Thanks', 'look', 'good', 'too', 'Come', 'here', 'SMOOCH', 'delivery', 'woman', 'was', 'master', 'craft.I', 'purchased', 'VHS', 'decade', 'ago', 'Amazon', 'took', '13', 'years', 'review', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'theMae', 'West', 'Glamour', 'CollectionDVD', 'set', '5', 'movies', 'worth', 'purchasing', 'especially', 'are', 'fan.Although', 'film', 'inferior', 'outrageous', 'outstanding', 'Done', 'Him', 'Wrong', 'Goin', 'Town', 'still', 'classic', 'Mae', 'West', 'cuts', 'may', 'have', 'resulted', 'strict', 'production', 'code', 'time', 'not', 'often', 'recognized', 'being', 'best', 'film', 'money', 'one', 'best', 'up', 'repeated', 'viewings']",N/A

335836,A2R6RA8FRBS608,6302798523,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[1, 1]","--quote by Mae WestGoin' to Town is a fast paced Mae West vehicle; although a great deal happens it's really not that hard to follow along. Some people may say that too much happens in this film; but I think it's great entertainment. The choreography and cinematography are very well done and the musical score enhances the film. We even get Mae singing a couple of songs; and the opera Samson and Delilah is campy at the same time that it lets Mae West sing even more!When the action starts, we quickly meet Cleo Borden (Mae West) who, on a roll of the dice, becomes engaged to cattle rustler Buck Gonzalez (Fred Kohler). Gonzalez is killed and Cleo finds out on her wedding day that she won't be getting married after all; but because she has a contract between her and Buck she inherits his fortune--oil wells and all! Cleo retains Buck's accountant Winslow (Gilbert Emery) who also starts coaching her in how to be a lady; Cleo wants to climb up the ladder! She has her sights on handsome Edward Carrington (Paul Cavanagh) and tries to nab him right away; but she only gets his attention after she literally shoots off his hat and ropes him in toward her so Carrington is not going to be easy to get. Carrington finds Cleo attractive; but he wants a lady and Cleo just won't fit the bill.And so the plot goes on--now Cleo decides to follow Carrington to Buenos Aires where she enters her horse Cactus in a wildly popular race; and it is there that she also meets the snooty Mrs. Crane Brittony (Marjorie Gateson); Brittony's quasi-boyfriend Ivan Valadov (Ivan Lebedeff) and Mrs. Brittony's rather inept/gambler nephew Fletcher Colton (Monroe Owsley). There is a plot to get Cactus out of the race and discredit Cleo but it is Mrs. Brittony who suffers defeat. It doesn't please Mrs. Brittony any more, either, when she finds out that Cleo and Fletcher are now joined in a marriage of convenience. Meanwhile, Cleo still has her eyes on Carrington.There's a lot more to the plot but I'll stop here to avoid giving out too many spoilers. Suffice it to say that the reminder of the film focuses on how everything works out especially for Cleo.Look also for solid performances by Tito Coral as Taho and Joe Frye as horse jockey Laughing Eagle.Overall, Goin' to Town showcases Mae West's talent very well and it's a definite must-have for her fans. It even makes a great introduction to Mae West! It's great entertainment. Fans of the other actors in this film would do well to add this to their collections; and people who like comedy with a few musical numbers and even some drama will appreciate this film.",5,Too Much Of A Good Thing Can Be WONDERFUL !!!,1348185600,"09 21, 2012",2012,2607,"['quote', 'Mae', 'WestGoin', 'Town', 'fast', 'paced', 'Mae', 'West', 'vehicle', 'great', 'deal', 'really', 'not', 'that', 'follow', 'along', 'people', 'may', 'say', 'too', 'much', 'happens', 'film', 'think', 'great', 'entertainment', 'choreography', 'cinematography', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'musical', 'score', 'film', 'even', 'get', 'Mae', 'singing', 'couple', 'songs', 'opera', 'Samson', 'Delilah', 'campy', 'same', 'time', 'Mae', 'West', 'sing', 'even', 'more', 'When', 'action', 'quickly', 'meet', 'Cleo', 'Borden', 'Mae', 'West', 'who', 'roll', 'dice', 'becomes', 'engaged', 'cattle', 'rustler', 'Buck', 'Gonzalez', 'Fred', 'Kohler', 'Gonzalez', 'killed', 'Cleo', 'out', 'wedding', 'day', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'getting', 'married', 'contract', 'Buck', 'fortune', 'oil', 'wells', 'Cleo', 'Buck', 'accountant', 'Winslow', 'Gilbert', 'Emery', 'who', 'also', 'coaching', 'how', 'be', 'lady', 'Cleo', 'climb', 'up', 'ladder', 'sights', 'handsome', 'Edward', 'Carrington', 'Paul', 'Cavanagh', 'nab', 'right', 'away', 'only', 'attention', 'literally', 'shoots', 'off', 'hat', 'Carrington', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'easy', 'get', 'Carrington', 'Cleo', 'attractive', 'lady', 'Cleo', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'fit', 'bill.And', 'plot', 'now', 'Cleo', 'follow', 'Carrington', 'Buenos', 'Aires', 'where', 'horse', 'Cactus', 'wildly', 'popular', 'race', 'there', 'also', 'snooty', 'Mrs.', 'Crane', 'Brittony', 'Marjorie', 'Gateson', 'Brittony', 'quasi-boyfriend', 'Ivan', 'Valadov', 'Ivan', 'Lebedeff', 'Mrs.', 'Brittony', 'rather', 'inept/gambler', 'Fletcher', 'Colton', 'Monroe', 'Owsley', 'plot', 'get', 'Cactus', 'race', 'discredit', 'Cleo', 'Mrs.', 'Brittony', 'who', 'defeat', ""n't"", 'please', 'Mrs.', 'Brittony', 'more', 'either', 'when', 'out', 'Cleo', 'Fletcher', 'are', 'now', 'joined', 'marriage', 'convenience', 'Meanwhile', 'Cleo', 'still', 'eyes', 'Carrington.There', 'lot', 'more', 'plot', ""'ll"", 'stop', 'here', 'avoid', 'giving', 'out', 'too', 'many', 'spoilers', 'Suffice', 'say', 'reminder', 'film', 'how', 'everything', 'out', 'especially', 'Cleo.Look', 'also', 'solid', 'performances', 'Tito', 'Coral', 'Taho', 'Joe', 'Frye', 'horse', 'jockey', 'Laughing', 'Eagle.Overall', 'Goin', 'Town', 'showcases', 'Mae', 'West', 'talent', 'very', 'well', 'definite', 'must-have', 'fans', 'even', 'great', 'introduction', 'Mae', 'West', 'great', 'entertainment', 'Fans', 'other', 'actors', 'film', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'add', 'collections', 'people', 'who', 'comedy', 'few', 'musical', 'numbers', 'even', 'drama', 'will', 'appreciate', 'film']",N/A

Mae extended her vocal range to the big aria (or an approximation thereof!) from Saint Saen's SAMSON AND DELILAH, but she seemed more at home singing HE'S A BAD, BAD MAN, BUT HE'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME!.  GOIN' TO TOWN didn't startle West's fans by straying too far from her usual story of an ambitious woiking goil rising from rhinestones to diamonds, and took pains not to shock censorship groups - too much.  Mae could no more be separated from sexual insinuation than Donald Duck from his quack, but her shafts of wit were now toned down noticeably from the outrageous to the merely naughty; the audience reaction to the film was similarily subdued.  The movie made plenty of money, however and in 1935, West was the highest paid woman in America (her income reached - an astonishing - for 1935 - $480,000).

Mae West, the ultimate big city gal is transferred to the west as a saloon queen named Cleo Borden who becomes a cattle queen after the death of her wealthy fiance.  Not one to cry over spilt milk, Mae is soon on the make with the overseer of her late beau's estate, blue-blooded Englishman Paul Cavanaugh, who somehow is immune to the lady's voluptuous charms and is not interested in a personal relationship.  ""I'm here to take care of the cattle and the men (ranch employees),"" he sniffs.  ""You're worry about the cattle - I'll take care of the men!"" is Cleo's response.Cleo's new holdings make her a major player in the world of horse racing where she comes into contact with the society crowd.  Determined to become a ""society dame"" (all the better to impress the elusive Cavanaugh) she enters a marriage of convenience with a socially promenient but financially destitute Monroe Owsley and bankrolls him out of debt in exchange for the place in society for being his wife, not counting on problems from her rival at the racetrack, Marjorie Gateson, who happens to be Monroe's aunt.  Rather than sponsoring an opera like Ms. Gateson, Cleo decides to star in one - a production of SAMSON AND DELILAH with Mae tackling opera quite creditably.GOIN' TO TOWN is loaded with classic Mae West quips and one-liners. She is superb and while a bit plump, she has a curvacious beauty that sparkles especially as ""lady barber"" Delilah. If there's a flaw in the film, it's in her ""seven leading men, count 'em"" (as publicized by Paramount) there's not one single man in the cast who can really hold their own against this phenomeonal female.  The main supporting honors go to the superb character actress Marjorie Gateson in a quinessential portrayal of an upper-class hypocrite, a pampered middle-aged beauty. All ice-cold matronly glamour and ruthlessness, Gateson comes as close as any woman ever did to threatening to steal a picture from Mae West.  But then no woman - or man - could ever quite do that.  Mae West dominates a movie, ANY movie, in a way that only a few stars - Pickford, Garbo, Hepburn, Davis - ever could.
