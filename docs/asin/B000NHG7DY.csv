Set during the War Between the States, it is an unusual film in that it actually gives the reasons for the Southern point of view, instead of just the typical South bashing prevalent in War Between the States movies.  Unfortunately, it falls short of being a good movie, mainly because of the constant use of flashbacks and the switching back and forth between time periods to the point where it is confusing.  Also, the movie was too serious all the time.  There were scenes where lightheartedness was called for, such as in the beginning early courtship stage of the love story, which would make the viewer get more involved in the plot.  Also, it is kind of shocking that the descendants of the couple would include a risque love scene of their own ancestors.  Times sure have changed!

The fact that the lead male character is the great, great grandson of the actual character he portrays in the movie just adds so much validity to the story of the Last Confederate. The movie only had two expletives in it and the romance scenes were very tastefully done. This is a movie based on a true family's experiences. The battle scenes are very well done though they are graphic in showing what war is really like. We enjoyed the EXTRAs that are included on this DVD as much as the actual movie. The interviews with the real family descendants and the actors who portrayed them is very moving. And the Outtakes of scenes that were adapted or omitted is interesting as well. It is a movie that we will watch again and again, each time picking up new details from the storyline.

1056591,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000NHG7DY,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[120, 126]","Albert Woolson, the last veteran of the Union army in the Civil War died in Duluth, Minnesota in 1956, and every time I drive by the Depot I see his statue.  So when I saw the title, ""The Last Confederate: The Story of Robert Adams,"" I naturally thought that this movie was about Woolson's rebel counterpart (I am sure ""The Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All"" was contributing to my interpretation as well).  The film is indeed about a real person, but Robert Adams did not live to see the 20th century let alone be in the running for the title of the last Confederate (which turns out to be an extremely disputed title given Confederate war records were largely destroyed at the end of the war).  However Adams did serve and fight in the Civil War, whereas Woolson was a drummer boy for an artillery regiment that never saw action.  The film was originally entitled ""Strike the Tent,"" which Civil War buffs might recognize as being the last words purportedly spoken by Robert E. Lee, but would leave most people without a clue that this is about the Civil War.  So at least ""The Last Confederate"" is a more obvious clue.But what you cannot tell from either title is that what makes this independent film rather unique is that it was made because of the efforts of Adams' descendant.  Julian Adams, who co-wrote the script, co-produced the film, co-directed it, and plays the title role, is the great-great-grandson of Robert Adams.  Julian's father Weston, the family history, gets a story credit, plays the older version of great-grandfather (so Julian co-plays it as well), and does the film's narration.  The movie was filmed mostly in South Carolina and the Adams home is the one owned by Robert's brother and has been in the family since before the Civil War.  When the character of Robert takes out his watch that is the actual watch of the real Robert, and the piano music that we see Tippi Hedren playing was owned by Robert's wife, Eveline.  The story of anyone who went off to fight in the Civil War will have its moments, but Eveline McCord Adams makes this story even more interesting because she was a Yankee, who came to South Carolina to be a governess and teach the piano and who fell in love with a Southerner on the eve of the Civil War.Such a relationship might be the stuff of melodrama, but one thing ""The Last Confederate"" has going for it is a sense of dignity.  Robert and Eveline are both portrayed as being solid and serious, no more prone to start yelling as they are to engage in copious weeping.  They might be in love, but they have no romantic illusions about the coming war.  Robert goes off to war to protect his land and the life he knows, but we also get the sense that he a much more realistic idea of what is going to happen to the South.  Adams is a planter, but we get no real sense of slavery on the family plantation, and it is the sense of inevitable death and destruction that the war brings that casts a shadow between Robert and Eveline.  The story is more like ""Cold Mountain"" than it is ""Gone with the Wind,"" which is probably the best way of identifying the potential audience for this 2005 independent film.Gwendolyn Edwards (who wrote some of the songs and music in the film) co-stars as Eveline, with co-screenwriter Joshua Lindsey as her brother Nelson McCord and Amy Redord as his wife Sylvia.  In addition to Hedren as Grandmother Adams, the Adams were able to get Mickey Rooney to play grandfather David McCord.  Eric Holloway plays Benjamin Young, who is Robert's companion through most of the war, including the time they spent in a Yankee prison in Elmira.  The film is co-directed by another first time filmmaker, A. Blaine Miller, and the production is able to take advantage of filming Civil War reenactors at play and incorporating such shots into their narrative (maybe it was stock footage, but I have yet to see a Civil War go wrong just pointing a camera at reenactors).  The film won several awards at various festivals and the fact that the Adams family not only got the film made but managed to make one that is pretty good has simply captivated a lot of viewers.  The DVD includes a documentary, ""Once Upon a Time in the South: Behind 'The Last Confederate'"" that fills you in on the family history and ends with shots of the graves of Robert and Eveline Adams, underscoring one final time that this movie is a most unusual family affair.",4,The Adams family makes a Civil War movie about their ancestors,1183161600,"06 30, 2007",2007,4416,"['Albert', 'Woolson', 'last', 'veteran', 'Union', 'army', 'Civil', 'War', 'died', 'Duluth', 'Minnesota', '1956', 'time', 'drive', 'Depot', 'see', 'statue', 'when', 'saw', 'title', 'Last', 'Confederate', 'Story', 'Robert', 'Adams', 'naturally', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'Woolson', 'rebel', 'counterpart', 'am', 'sure', 'Oldest', 'Living', 'Confederate', 'Widow', 'Tells', 'All', 'was', 'contributing', 'interpretation', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'indeed', 'real', 'person', 'Robert', 'Adams', 'did', 'not', 'live', 'see', '20th', 'century', 'let', 'alone', 'be', 'running', 'title', 'last', 'Confederate', 'out', 'be', 'extremely', 'disputed', 'title', 'given', 'Confederate', 'war', 'records', 'were', 'largely', 'destroyed', 'end', 'war', 'However', 'Adams', 'did', 'serve', 'fight', 'Civil', 'War', 'Woolson', 'was', 'drummer', 'boy', 'artillery', 'regiment', 'never', 'saw', 'action', 'film', 'was', 'originally', 'entitled', 'Tent', 'Civil', 'War', 'buffs', 'might', 'recognize', 'being', 'last', 'words', 'purportedly', 'spoken', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Lee', 'would', 'leave', 'most', 'people', 'clue', 'Civil', 'War', 'So', 'least', 'Last', 'Confederate', 'more', 'obvious', 'clue.But', 'what', 'can', 'not', 'tell', 'title', 'what', 'independent', 'film', 'rather', 'unique', 'was', 'made', 'efforts', 'Adams', 'descendant', 'Julian', 'Adams', 'who', 'co-wrote', 'script', 'co-produced', 'film', 'co-directed', 'title', 'role', 'great-great-grandson', 'Robert', 'Adams', 'Julian', 'father', 'Weston', 'family', 'history', 'story', 'credit', 'older', 'version', 'great-grandfather', 'so', 'Julian', 'co-plays', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'narration', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'mostly', 'South', 'Carolina', 'Adams', 'home', 'one', 'owned', 'Robert', 'brother', 'been', 'family', 'Civil', 'War', 'When', 'character', 'Robert', 'out', 'watch', 'actual', 'watch', 'real', 'Robert', 'piano', 'music', 'see', 'Tippi', 'Hedren', 'playing', 'was', 'owned', 'Robert', 'wife', 'Eveline', 'story', 'anyone', 'who', 'went', 'fight', 'Civil', 'War', 'will', 'have', 'moments', 'Eveline', 'McCord', 'Adams', 'story', 'even', 'more', 'interesting', 'was', 'Yankee', 'who', 'came', 'South', 'Carolina', 'be', 'governess', 'teach', 'piano', 'who', 'fell', 'love', 'Southerner', 'eve', 'Civil', 'War.Such', 'relationship', 'might', 'be', 'stuff', 'melodrama', 'one', 'thing', 'Last', 'Confederate', 'going', 'sense', 'dignity', 'Robert', 'Eveline', 'are', 'portrayed', 'being', 'solid', 'serious', 'more', 'prone', 'start', 'yelling', 'are', 'engage', 'copious', 'weeping', 'might', 'be', 'love', 'have', 'romantic', 'illusions', 'coming', 'war', 'Robert', 'war', 'protect', 'land', 'life', 'also', 'get', 'sense', 'much', 'more', 'realistic', 'idea', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'South', 'Adams', 'planter', 'get', 'real', 'sense', 'slavery', 'family', 'plantation', 'sense', 'inevitable', 'death', 'destruction', 'war', 'shadow', 'Robert', 'Eveline', 'story', 'more', 'Cold', 'Mountain', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'probably', 'best', 'way', 'identifying', 'potential', 'audience', '2005', 'independent', 'film.Gwendolyn', 'Edwards', 'who', 'wrote', 'songs', 'music', 'film', 'co-stars', 'Eveline', 'co-screenwriter', 'Joshua', 'Lindsey', 'brother', 'Nelson', 'McCord', 'Amy', 'Redord', 'wife', 'Sylvia', 'addition', 'Hedren', 'Grandmother', 'Adams', 'Adams', 'were', 'able', 'get', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'play', 'grandfather', 'David', 'McCord', 'Eric', 'Holloway', 'Benjamin', 'Young', 'who', 'Robert', 'companion', 'most', 'war', 'including', 'time', 'spent', 'Yankee', 'prison', 'Elmira', 'film', 'co-directed', 'first', 'time', 'filmmaker', 'A.', 'Blaine', 'Miller', 'production', 'able', 'take', 'advantage', 'filming', 'Civil', 'War', 'reenactors', 'play', 'incorporating', 'such', 'shots', 'narrative', 'maybe', 'was', 'stock', 'footage', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'Civil', 'War', 'go', 'wrong', 'just', 'pointing', 'camera', 'reenactors', 'film', 'won', 'several', 'awards', 'various', 'festivals', 'fact', 'Adams', 'family', 'not', 'only', 'got', 'film', 'made', 'managed', 'make', 'one', 'pretty', 'good', 'simply', 'captivated', 'lot', 'viewers', 'DVD', 'documentary', 'Once', 'Time', 'South', ""'The"", 'Last', 'Confederate', 'family', 'history', 'shots', 'graves', 'Robert', 'Eveline', 'Adams', 'underscoring', 'one', 'final', 'time', 'movie', 'most', 'unusual', 'family', 'affair']",The Last Confederate: The Story of Robert Adams

This family should have done more research into the customs of that time because Robert and Eveline would never had been out alone together without a chaperone. It just was not done, especially not in the south. Also nice respectable young ladies always had there hair done up tightly on there heads and not falling all around there face like the actress in this movie. It just amazed me that at the height of the civil war that Eveline's teeth were beautifully white and her clothes were in such pristine condition, and after years of war. By the end of the movie I felt nothing for these charters, especially Mickey Rooney's performance as Eveline's dying grandfather. I felt like I never took a journey back in time to one of the bloodiest times in American history.

Were they watching a different film than I was?  The movie is an insightful and INTELLIGENT portrayal of the event that transformed the nation.  Also, the choice of the actor...apparently a distant relative...to play the real-life Robert Adams, works.  The man is a genuine Southernor [as opposed to a Hollywood Southernor] and sounds, looks and behaves like a Southernor.  His acting is convincing. The quality of the audio on my DVD was poor but I rate a movie/book on its overall quality, not technicals.This is an absolutely superior film about love and war.  The director has managed to weave a beautiful and sensitive love story into, through and around the brutality of an incredible war.  The primary character, Robert Adams, is wonderful in his dedication to his woman and especially to the land he loves.  He is a patriot, a nationalist and also a bit of a fanatic.  When given more than an opportunity to quit the war and live peacefully with the woman he loves, he opts for privation, hardship, loneliness and danger.  Others may quit but Adams doesn't.Nevertheless, Adams is riven by guilt for having his men and friends killed around him.  Likewise, he feels guilt for abandoning the woman he truly loves.  He is guilty of convincing men who aren't cut out for war into the fray, where they are slaughtered.  Crawling with guilt but with a sense of honor even greater, he fights on...Ron Braithwaite, author of novels--'Skull Rack' and 'Hummingbird God'--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico",5,I could not love thee half as much loved I not honor more.,1229126400,"12 13, 2008",2008,1589,"['Man', 'do', 'disagree', 'reviewers', 'who', 'gave', ""'The"", 'Last', 'Confederate', 'low', 'rating', 'Were', 'watching', 'different', 'film', 'was', 'movie', 'insightful', 'INTELLIGENT', 'portrayal', 'event', 'transformed', 'nation', 'Also', 'choice', 'actor', 'apparently', 'distant', 'relative', 'play', 'real-life', 'Robert', 'Adams', 'man', 'genuine', 'Southernor', '[', 'opposed', 'Hollywood', 'Southernor', ']', 'sounds', 'looks', 'behaves', 'Southernor', 'acting', 'convincing', 'quality', 'audio', 'DVD', 'was', 'poor', 'rate', 'movie/book', 'overall', 'quality', 'not', 'absolutely', 'superior', 'film', 'love', 'war', 'director', 'managed', 'weave', 'beautiful', 'sensitive', 'love', 'story', 'brutality', 'incredible', 'war', 'primary', 'character', 'Robert', 'Adams', 'wonderful', 'dedication', 'woman', 'especially', 'land', 'patriot', 'nationalist', 'also', 'bit', 'fanatic', 'When', 'given', 'more', 'opportunity', 'quit', 'war', 'live', 'peacefully', 'woman', 'privation', 'hardship', 'loneliness', 'danger', 'Others', 'may', 'quit', 'Adams', ""doesn't.Nevertheless"", 'Adams', 'riven', 'guilt', 'having', 'men', 'friends', 'killed', 'Likewise', 'guilt', 'abandoning', 'woman', 'loves', 'guilty', 'convincing', 'men', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'cut', 'out', 'war', 'fray', 'where', 'are', 'slaughtered', 'Crawling', 'guilt', 'sense', 'honor', 'even', 'greater', 'Ron', 'Braithwaite', 'author', 'novels', 'Rack', ""'Hummingbird"", 'God', 'Spanish', 'Conquest', 'Mexico']",The Last Confederate: The Story of Robert Adams
1056599,A1NTXJPTFP1G03,B000NHG7DY,"Van T. Roberts ""Film Historian""","[6, 13]","History veracity doesn't necessarily translate into cinematic virtuosity. The well-intentioned people that fought tooth and nail to produce the 2005 Civil War romance ""The Last Confederate: The Story of Robert Adams"" (* out of ****) a.k.a. ""Strike the Tent,"" are direct descendants of the protagonist. Co-director, producer, scenarist, and leading man Julian Adams, who plays his real-life great-great grandfather Robert Adams, deserves recognition for this reverential independent film production that depicts one Southerner's view of the War Between the States. Indeed, Adams has garnered several Indie film awards for this effort. Nevertheless, ""The Last Confederate"" qualifies as a tedious re-enactment with wooden performances by all except Mickey Rooney in a bit part as a bedridden Pennsylvania uncle. However, I must add that ""The Last Confederate"" is a film worth watching, even though I didn't like it. I had to opportunity to speak with Julian Adams, the auteur who wore all the hats on the production, and he shared his experiences in making the film. Although I loathe this amateurish movie, I have a great deal of respect for the trials and tribulations that Adams endured to produce and distribute it. Anybody who peruses this critique can disagree with my appraisal of the film. Mr. Adams took issue with my appraisal. Feedback isn't something that I often receive. Had Adams been a Hollywood mogul, I'd have laughed in this face, but he isn't a mogul. He knows that his film isn't perfect, but it isn't perfect because he didn't have a budget.As the descendant of a Mississippi Civil War soldier, I enjoy movies told from the Confederate perspective, but ""The Last Confederate"" conjures up little suspense and excitement, and the dialogue is hopelessly contrived. Sadly, the actors and actresses could have been reading their lines directly from cue cards for all the heart that they put into their performances. Once again, this is an independent production and good talent doesn't come without some considerable expense. Let's just say that they performed their parts as the late Spencer Tracy observed. They uttered their lines and they didn't bump into the furniture. As the hero, Adams generates a dearth of charisma, but then he did have his hands full with producing this epic, right down to sinking his own money into the handguns and the muskets.Technically, everything appears accurate enough, but dramatically, this period piece never generates momentum, even during the explosive battle scenes. Adams manages to stage one good gunfight in a shack toward the end. Indeed, most of the epic scale battle sequences are simply re-enactors fighting battles with cameras set up on the periphery of the action. I know because I was once a television news reporter and I shot footage of the battle of Shiloh. These scenes with hundreds of dutiful re-enactors parading around and discharging their black powder arms contribute solid production value, but they don't bolster the drama. Adams renders no judgments against either side, North or South, and the political content is conspicuously absent, but ""The Last Confederate"" wasn't made to pontificate about values. Adams told me that he was simply relating the facts of history. In any case, on his tight budget, adopting an attitude would have been more than his low budget could have accommodated. The romance between Adams and a Pennsylvania woman, Eveline McCord (co-scenarist Gwendolyn Edwards of ""The Broken Hearts Club""), who came to South Carolina to teach school before hostilities broke out, lacks any poignancy. Alas, it's really a shame, but this romance really occurred.Directors A. Blaine Miller and Julian Adams relate their yarn in flashback. Our hero, Captain Robert Adams, rushes to the aid of a wounded Confederate soldier and looks up to find a Union soldier drawing a bead on him with his revolver. The remaining 90 or so minutes that ensues is devoted to events before and after the war, and with a hint that perhaps the protagonist didn't survive this trial by bloodshed. Miller and Adams never make the protagonists seem sympathetic until the middle of the action when Adams and two of his friends engineer an escape from a Federal prison and a vengeful Yankee officer pursues them. The filmmakers lacked the budget to develop the kind of tension that would make you fear for the lives of the characters. The villain isn't very villainous.  For the record, Adams survived the war, and Eveline and he raised four children and ran a school. What makes Robert Adams is important and essential as a Confederate patriot is never explained. Julian Adams doesn't provide enough insight into his character to differentiate him from countless other characters. He strikes a gallant figure, but we never get under his skin. Alas, the fortunes of low budget film-making prevented Adams from addressing this problem. The romance between the hero and the heroine is sterile. Some histrionics--you crying, screaming, shouting, torrid kissing--wouldn't have harmed this otherwise cardboard drama. Shawn Lewallan's color photography makes the grade, but there isn't much subtlety in his lighting. If you suffer through the end credits, the producers reveal that they invoked dramatic license to make their history more palatable. Ostensibly, ""The Last Confederate"" boasts ambitious intentions, but delivers only a modicum of dramatic impact. Comparisons with the multi-million dollar ""Cold Mountain"" are inevitable. Initially, when I reviewed this film (which I bought with my own bucks, I described it rather disparagingly as ""Dull Mountain."" I still think it is pretty dull, but I will be a man enough critic to applaud Mr. Adams for making this film. He invested his heart and soul in ""The Last Confederate."" While I didn't care for this movie, I appreciate it a lot more after having a conversation with Mr. Adams. Just because I didn't like it--for purely artistic reasons--doesn't mean that you will dislike.",1,Julian Adams Is A Better Producer Than He Is A Director.,1228089600,"12 1,

At Elmira, New York, U.S. Army guards turned away local citizens who brought farm produce to the gate for the Confederate prisoners inside; the U. S.
